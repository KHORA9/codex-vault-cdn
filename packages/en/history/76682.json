The Protestant Theologians of France, 1654–1700.=--The\r\nProtestant theological literature of France and of French Switzerland\r\nis more fully represented in the Index than are the corresponding\r\ngroups of Holland and Germany; but in the case of the French authors\r\nalso the selection is rather haphazard, the names of important\r\nauthors being omitted, while of others only single books, and of\r\nthese the least characteristic, have been included. Certain works\r\nalso which escaped condemnation at the time of the first publication\r\nsecure attention from the censors only a number of years later. Such\r\nProtestant writers in the first half of the 17th century as Chamier,\r\nPicter, Capel, and Bochart were overlooked altogether.\r\n\r\nJacques Abbadie (1654–1727) comes into the Index in connection with\r\nhis _Traité de la Vérité de la Religion Chrétienne_. The edition\r\nprohibited was that of 1688, the entry finding place in the list of\r\n1703. Remond’s treatise, _L’Antéchrist Romain opposé à l’Antéchrist\r\nJuif, du Bellarmin_, secured naturally fairly prompt attention,\r\nbeing condemned in 1609, the year after its appearance.\r\n\r\nLa Bastide’s monograph, _Exposition de la Doctrine de l’Église\r\nCatholique sur les Matières de Controverse_, was prohibited in 1693,\r\ntwenty years after its publication. This is the only one of the series\r\nof replies to the treatise of Bossuet which secured condemnation.\r\n\r\nIsaac la Peyrère published in Holland, in 1655, a treatise entitled\r\n_Praeadamitae s. Exercitatio super V. 12–14, cap. 5. epistolae ad\r\nRomanos item Systema theologicum ex Praeadamitarum Hypothesi_. The\r\nbook was censured by the Bishop of Namur, and copies were publicly\r\nburned in Paris. In 1656, Peyrère was imprisoned in the Spanish\r\nNetherlands, but, on his application, was sent to Rome for trial. In\r\nadvance of his trial, he became Catholic and retracted the utterances\r\nin his book. Later, he wrote a second treatise in confutation of the\r\nfirst. Notwithstanding the emphasis given to the earlier book, it is\r\nnot included in the Index lists.\r\n\r\n\r\n=2. Theological Contests in the Netherlands, 1654–1690.=--The issues\r\nthat arose in the Netherlands during the second half of the 17th\r\ncentury between the Jesuits and the Franciscans on the one side, and\r\nthe theologians of the University of Louvain and the leaders of the\r\nother orders and of the clergy on the other, had to do not only with\r\nthe doctrine of Grace but also with questions of theological morality\r\nand pastoral theology (the administration, for instance, of confession\r\nand communion), and, after 1682, were also concerned with some of\r\nthe contentions that had been brought up by the Gallican Church. As a\r\nresult of a long series of controversies that arose concerning these\r\nissues, a very considerable number of the works of theological writers\r\nof the Low Countries came into the Index. It was the practice of the\r\nleaders on either side to make application to Rome to have condemned\r\nthe works brought into print by their adversaries. The authorities\r\nin Rome appear to have condemned with a fair measure of impartiality\r\nthe controversial writings on both sides. In 1677, the University of\r\nLouvain sent to Rome, with the approval of the Spanish King (Charles\r\nII), four professors who were charged with the duty of securing the\r\ncondemnation of a series of propositions described as adverse to sound\r\nmorality, and at the same time to defend against the assaults of the\r\nJesuits the true doctrine of Grace. In response to this application,\r\nInnocent XI, in March, 1679, caused to be condemned by a decree of the\r\nInquisition sixty-five propositions. The decree followed the lines\r\nof that issued in 1665 for forty-five propositions then defined as\r\nunorthodox. In regard to the doctrine of Grace, the Holy See decided\r\nthat the teaching presented in the censures promulgated in 1558 by the\r\nfaculties of Louvain and Douay, was sound and was to be upheld. As was\r\nthe case with the decrees in 1665 and 1666, the particular works from\r\nwhich the condemned propositions had been cited were not specified. A\r\nnumber of monographs in which the question was brought up as to the\r\nauthors who were responsible for these condemned propositions, and\r\nparticularly as to whether these authors were or were not Jesuits,\r\nwere themselves condemned. After the publication of the decree of\r\n1679, the Inquisition gave attention to the investigation of certain\r\npropositions which had been denounced by the opponents of the Louvain\r\ndivines as contained in the writings of these, and as also contained\r\nin certain other works classed as Jansenist. In 1690, was published by\r\nAlexander VIII a decree which had been framed under the instructions\r\nof Innocent XI, condemning as unorthodox thirty-one propositions which\r\nhad been found in this group of writings. The propositions condemned\r\nhad to do in part with what may be called the moralities and in part\r\nwith the doctrine of Grace. The proposition bearing in this series the\r\nnumber twenty-nine, took the ground that the claim for the superiority\r\nof the pope over the general council of the Church, and for the\r\ninfallibility of the pope in the decision of questions of dogma, was a\r\nclaim for which there was no foundation (_Futilis et toties convulsa\r\nassertio_). Certain monographs written to criticise and oppose this\r\ndecree were promptly prohibited. The action taken during these years\r\ngives evidence of the development of the policy of the Church in the\r\nmatter of defining or of approving or condemning doctrinal assertions,\r\nor propositions having to do with theology or morality, apart from\r\nthe condemnation by title of any works in which such propositions may\r\nhave been contained. A condemnation of this kind freely interpreted\r\nconstitutes, of course, a condemnation not only of all books which had\r\nbeen brought into print up to that time containing such propositions or\r\ndoctrines, but (without the necessity of specific prohibition by title)\r\na condemnation which may serve as a prohibition of all books coming\r\ninto print at a later date containing similar doctrines. On the other\r\nhand, the fact that the propositions as specified were often found\r\nopen to different interpretations (as in the case of the famous five\r\npropositions of Jansen), and the further fact that it was not always\r\neasy to determine whether the statements or expressions in certain\r\nworks brought into question were actually identical with propositions,\r\nclassed as heretical, had the result of bringing into print after every\r\nsuch condemnation of propositions, a group of writings undertaking\r\neither to analyse the propositions themselves or to confirm or to\r\ndeny the application of the condemnation to works with which they had\r\nbeen connected. The necessity for analysing, and in large part for\r\ncondemning, the writings of this class, involved probably in the end a\r\nlarger amount of detailed labour for the Index authorities than would\r\nhave been required if, in place of condemning general propositions, the\r\noriginal condemnation had been connected with specific writings. The\r\nthirty-one propositions condemned in the decree of Alexander VIII of\r\n1690 were described as _temerariae_, _scandalosae_, _male sonantes_,\r\n_injuriosae_, _haeresi proximae_, ... _schismaticae et haereticae_,\r\netc. Certain of the propositions were taken from the writings of\r\nLupus, Huygens, Havermans, Gabrielis; _La Fréquente Communion_ of\r\nArnauld, and the _Monita_ of Widenfeld. Arnauld speaks of this as _un\r\ndécret pitoyable_,[1] and Gerberon says: _Cette censure ambiguë est le\r\nscandale de la Cour Romaine, la honte du Saint Office et la confusion\r\ndu Pontificat d’Alexandre VIII_.[2]\r\n\r\n\r\n3. =The Protestant Theologians of Holland in the 17th\r\nCentury.=--The compilers of the Index selected from the Dutch\r\nwritings of this period only such books as were issued in Latin or\r\nas were printed later in French versions. It appears that the Dutch\r\nlanguage constituted a sufficient barrier to secure a practical\r\nprotection against the condemnation of the Church. It is noteworthy to\r\nremember, however, that this condemnation would in any case not have\r\nbeen likely to influence those readers who took their literature in the\r\nDutch form, and it is quite probable that the majority of these Dutch\r\nreaders never even knew that their authors had the distinction of being\r\nprohibited. Even in the case of those authors whose books did appear in\r\nthe world language of Latin, the selections of the Index compilers were\r\nmade at haphazard and omitted a number of the most noteworthy names.\r\nArminius, Voetius, Gomarus, Coccejus, and a number of other leaders of\r\nthought in Holland are not found in the Index. The Congregation did\r\nsucceed in getting into their lists the names of a number of obscure\r\nauthors whose books had been printed originally in Latin, but who were\r\nforgotten excepting in connection with this record. The treatise by\r\nGrotius, _De Jure Belli et Pacis_, and a few of the writings of\r\nHeinsius, Fossius, and Horne were prohibited.\r\n\r\n\r\n=4. The Protestant Theologians of England, 1676–1732.=--Up to the\r\ntime of Benedict XIV, none of the English theological writings which\r\nhad been printed in the vernacular received attention at the hands of\r\nthe compilers of the Indexes. Certain works were condemned which had\r\nbeen originally issued in Latin or of which French translations had\r\nbeen printed. The English writers begin to receive attention after\r\n1676, although even in these later Indexes the selections, as in the\r\ncase of the writers of Germany and Holland, are curiously incidental\r\nand have apparently been made with no consistent principle. The list\r\nfor the 17th century includes among the more noteworthy titles the\r\nfollowing: _Reformatio Ecclesiae Anglicanae quibus gradibus inchoata\r\net perfecta sit_, London, 1603; the writings of Bishop Hall († 1656);\r\nthe works of the scientist Robert Boyle, founder of the Boyle lectures\r\n(1627–91); the Polyglot Bible of Walton; the _Synopsis Criticorum_\r\nof Reginald Pole; the _Cantabrigensis tributa_ of Thomas James; the\r\n_Gravissimae Quaestiones de Christ. Ecclesiarum_, of James Usher,\r\nArchbishop of Armagh; certain works of Isaac Casaubon (1559–1614)\r\n(Casaubon was by birth a Swiss, but in connection with his long\r\nresidence and the place of publication of the greater portion of his\r\nbooks, he came to be classed with English scholars); the latest work\r\nof Casaubon to be condemned, the title of which has been continued in\r\nmodern Indexes, is the _Corona Regia_, a panegyric of James I; the\r\n_Regii sanguinis clamor ad coelum adversus parricidas Anglicanos_\r\n(This was first printed in The Hague in 1652, and later in London in\r\n1655. It constituted an answer to Milton’s essay _Pro populo Anglicano\r\ndefensio_. The author was later identified as Pierre du Moulin, a canon\r\nin Canterbury); _The History of the Reformation of England_ of Burnet\r\n(1643–1715) and the same author’s _History of his Own Times_ (These\r\ntwo books are described in the Index in the French editions. Burnet’s\r\nother writings escaped condemnation); Robert Baillie († 1662), _Operis\r\nhistorici et chronologici a creatione mundi ad Constantinum magnum_,\r\nprinted in Amsterdam in 1668; Pearson’s _Exposition of the Creed_;\r\nthe sermons of Bishop Sherlock (in the French version) and those of\r\nArchbishop Tillotson; a treatise on _Christian Perfection_ by Lucas;\r\nBartley’s _Apology for the True Christian_ (printed in the French\r\nversion in 1702, prohibited in 1712); Andrew Marvelle’s († 1678) _An\r\nAccount of the Growth of Popery and Absolute Government in England_\r\n(1675–76). (This was prohibited in its French edition; the Parliament\r\nhad, shortly after its first prohibition, offered a reward of £50 for\r\nthe identification of the author.) Williams, Bishop of Chester, finds\r\nplace in the Index in connection with his treatise on the _Discovery\r\nof a New World_, in which the author undertakes to prove that the moon\r\nis inhabited. This had been first printed in 1638; the condemnation\r\nin 1703 had to do with the French edition printed in Rouen in 1655.\r\nSelden’s _De jure naturali et gentium_, together with a number of his\r\nlater treatises which had appeared between the years 1640 and 1679,\r\nwere prohibited in 1714. Prideaux’s _The Old and the New Testament\r\nconnected in the History of the Jews and Neighbouring Nations_, printed\r\nin 1716, was prohibited in the French edition in 1732.\r\n\r\n\r\n=5. The Protestant Theologians of Germany, 1600–1750.=--The\r\ncancellation of Class I of the Index may be considered as constituting\r\none of the more distinctive modifications of the activity or assertions\r\nof authority on the part of the Congregation of the Index. Through\r\nthe 16th century, the view had obtained that in this class should be\r\nbrought together practically all of the heretical authors who had\r\nventured to treat of religious matters. After the Index of 1596,\r\nhowever, the attempt had been abandoned to specify in full the names\r\nof all of the works which on the ground of their heretical character\r\ncame under the proscription of Rule II. After that time, it was\r\nconsidered sufficient to place under a general condemnation all works\r\non religious subjects which came from writers outside of the Church.\r\nTo this general principle, however, certain noteworthy exceptions were\r\nmade. There continued to be a separate prohibition, by title, of books\r\nwhich had, on one ground or another, been brought to the attention of\r\nthe Congregation. The decrees of 1686–1700, 1703–1709, included, in\r\naddition to certain lists of Protestant theological writings, a series\r\nof the works of jurists of which the treatise by Grotius above cited is\r\na good example. The works so selected were for the most part concerned\r\nwith questions as to the sources of authority, whether of Church or of\r\nState.\r\n\r\nOne peculiarity of the condemnation of this particular group of books\r\nis the fact that their pernicious character came to the attention\r\nof the Congregation or of the examiners in many cases only a number\r\nof years after the publication of the books themselves, and, as has\r\nbeen pointed out, there are commemorated in this manner, as deserving\r\nof attention, not a few books which had gone out of print and had\r\nbeen practically forgotten in the communities in which they had been\r\npublished. Of the works on exegesis and in Church history published\r\nin Germany during the 17th century and the first half of the 18th, a\r\nnumber of the most important never found their way into the Index.\r\nThe titles selected covered in the majority of cases comparatively\r\ninsignificant books. There is, for instance, a long list of the\r\ncontroversial German writings directed against Bellarmin, Becanus, and\r\nGrester, which escaped attention altogether in Italy. Among the better\r\nknown names which did come under condemnation during this period are\r\nthose of Joh. L. Mosheim, for his _Ecclesiastical History_ and his\r\ntreatise on the _Institutions of Christianity_, and Swedenborg for the\r\n_Opera philosophica et mineralia_, published in Dresden in 1734 and\r\nprohibited in 1737. In the Index of Benedict, the _Opera philosophica_\r\nis omitted and in its place is given the _Principia rerum naturalium_.\r\nThe other treatises of this voluminous author escaped condemnation. The\r\nprohibition of Mosheim’s Church History was not sufficiently conclusive\r\nto prevent the book from being read in Italy. In 1769, an Italian\r\ntranslation by Roselli was published in Naples in ten volumes. This\r\nparticular edition was never listed in the Indexes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n           THE TREATMENT OF THE SCRIPTURES UNDER CENSORSHIP\r\n\r\n    1. Germany.\r\n    2. France.\r\n    3. Netherlands.\r\n    4. Spain.\r\n    5. England.\r\n    6. Scriptures in the Vernacular.\r\n\r\n\r\n=1. Germany.=--The cordial co-operation extended by the Church to\r\nthe work of the printers continued until the Humanists, more than a\r\ngeneration before the protest of Luther, began to assail the authority\r\nof the Church and the infallibility of the pope. The ecclesiastics\r\nnow took the ground that errors and heresies arose through a wrongful\r\nunderstanding of the Scriptures, and from the beginning of the 16th\r\ncentury, took measures to discourage, and finally to prohibit, the\r\ncirculation of the Scriptures.\r\n\r\nIn 1479, was printed in Cologne a fine edition of the Scriptures in\r\nLatin which bears record of the approval of the University of Cologne.\r\nThe term is _admissum et approbatum ab alma Universitate Coloniensi_.\r\nThis appears to be the earliest instance of the exercise of censorship\r\nby a university in connection with a printed book. Cologne had extended\r\nearly hospitality to the printing art and it was there that Colard\r\nMansion, the associate of Caxton, secured his training. It was only\r\nthrough the oppressive censorship of the faculty of theology in the\r\nUniversity that during the succeeding century the business of book\r\nproduction became seriously burdened and the city lost its relative\r\nimportance as a publishing centre.\r\n\r\nThe first Hebrew Bible printed in Europe was issued in Soncino, in\r\n1461, from the press of Abraham Colonto. In 1462, Fust brought to\r\nParis from Mayence a supply of his folio Bible, copies of which he was\r\nable to sell for fifty crowns. The usual price for manuscripts of this\r\ncompass had heretofore been four to five hundred crowns. The first\r\nBible printed in the vernacular was issued, in 1466, in Strasbourg by\r\nHeinrick Eggestein.\r\n\r\nAmong the earlier printers of Zurich (in which the work of printing\r\nbegan in 1504) was Christ Froschauer, who is known chiefly through his\r\nassociation with Zwingli. Froschauer, who devoted himself earnestly\r\nto the cause of the Calvinists, had a religious as well as a business\r\ninterest in securing a wide circulation for the works of Zwingli and\r\nhis associates, and together with these he printed editions of the\r\nBible not only in German but in French, Italian, Flemish, and English.\r\nFroschauer’s editions were the first Bibles printed on the Continent\r\nin the English tongue. For these Bibles, which were distributed at\r\nwhat to-day would be called popular prices, very considerable sales\r\nwere secured and the presses of Froschauer were thus made an important\r\nadjunct to the work of the Reformation.\r\n\r\nAnthoni Koberger of Nuremberg, at that time one of the greatest\r\npublishers of Europe, brought into print, in 1481, an edition in\r\neight volumes folio, of the Bible of Cardinal Hugo. This work had\r\nbeen produced about 1240, the editor having been made a cardinal by\r\nInnocent IV. It was used for two centuries (of course in manuscript\r\nform) as one of the theological text-books of the Sorbonne. The text\r\nof the Scriptures as revised by Hugo, together with his notes, were\r\nutilised by Luther and by a number of the later editors and translators\r\nof the Scriptures. Koberger’s publishing catalogue included in all no\r\nless than fifteen impressions of this _Biblia Latina_. In the year\r\n1483, the year in which Luther was born, Koberger published his German\r\nBible. The text was translated from the Latin of the Vulgate and was\r\nillustrated with woodcuts. It is not clear who was responsible for the\r\nversion or what was the German idiom utilised for it, but it was a form\r\nthat never took any permanent place in the literature of the country.\r\nLuther, referring to this Nuremberg Bible, declares that “no one could\r\nspeak German of this outlandish kind.” The catalogue of Koberger\r\nconstituted a very good representation of the foundations of scholarly\r\nCatholicism. The Catholic teachers who rested their contention for\r\nthe supremacy of the Roman Church upon the Scriptures as interpreted\r\nfor fourteen centuries by the scholars of the Church, depended for\r\nthe material of their teachings upon such folios as those produced by\r\nKoberger. Weighty as were these folios, and assured as appeared to\r\nbe the foundations upon which had been raised the great structure of\r\necclesiasticism, their instruction and their authority were undermined,\r\nat least for a large portion of the community, by the influence of the\r\nwidely circulated pamphlets and sheets, the _Flugschriften_, which\r\nbrought to the people the teachings of the reformers. A series of Latin\r\nBibles were printed by Froben of Basel between 1500 and 1528. His\r\nundertakings, like those of Koberger, were addressed almost exclusively\r\nto scholars. He added later a series of works of the Fathers and an\r\nedition of the New Testament in Greek edited by Erasmus. The Testament\r\nincluded, printed in parallel columns, an improved Latin version. This\r\nwas the first edition of the Greek text and it was utilised by Luther\r\nin the preparation of his German version. The text as shaped by Erasmus\r\nwas based in part upon the previous issue of Laurentius Valla, to whom\r\nmust be given the honour of having been the first scholar to attempt a\r\nrevision of the Scripture text by a comparison of authorities.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the approval given to the book by the pope, its\r\npublication brought out many and bitter criticisms. Accusations were\r\nheard of heresy and Arianism. Erasmus had departed from the version of\r\nthe Vulgate and in his Latin text had substituted pure Latin for the\r\nmonastic barbarisms; he had even, it was said, charged the Apostles\r\nwith writing bad Greek. He had had the temerity to correct a number of\r\ntexts in such a way as materially to alter their meaning, and in the\r\nfirst Epistle of John had ventured to omit altogether the testimony of\r\nthe “Three Witnesses.” This unfortunate verse, after being accepted by\r\nthe Protestants on the strength of its retention by Luther and of the\r\nlater and more scholarly authority of the editors of the King James\r\nversion, was finally condemned, as an interpolation, by the revisers\r\nunder Victoria, who were thus in a position, after an interval of three\r\nand a half centuries, to bear testimony to the scholarship and the\r\neditorial boldness of Erasmus. That Erasmus did possess the courage of\r\nhis convictions was evidenced by the character of the notes throughout\r\nthe volume; for instance, in commenting upon the famous text, Matt.\r\nXVI, 18, “Upon this rock will I build my church,” he takes occasion to\r\ndeny altogether the primacy of Peter and to express his surprise that\r\nwords undoubtedly meant to apply to all Christians should have been\r\ninterpreted as applying exclusively to the Roman pontiff; and this is\r\nsaid, it should be remembered, in a volume dedicated to the Pope.[3]\r\nThe paraphrase of the New Testament, printed by Erasmus in Basel in\r\n1524 was reprinted in an English version in London, and the work was so\r\nhighly appreciated in England that a copy was ordered to be placed in\r\nevery parish church beside the Bible.\r\n\r\nIt was the influence of Erasmus (who was at the time in good favour\r\nwith the Pope, Leo X) that secured for Froben, in 1514, a papal\r\nprivilege for a term of five years for the works of St. Jerome.\r\n\r\n\r\n=2. France.=--Up to the close of the 12th century, the Church appears\r\nto have issued no regulations in regard to the use of the Bible in the\r\nvernacular or to the reading of the Bible in any form by laymen. In\r\nthe 13th century, several of the synods in France prohibited the use\r\nof French versions of the Bible, and forbade the laity from reading\r\ntheological writings or the Scriptures in any form (excepting the\r\nPsalms).[4] These regulations failed, however, to secure any uniform or\r\nenduring obedience.\r\n\r\nIn 1522, Robert Estienne of Paris, working as the assistant of his\r\nstepfather Colines, undertook the preparation of an edition in Latin\r\nof the New Testament. The text followed, in the main, the version\r\nof the Vulgate, but the youthful editor found occasion for certain\r\ncorrections. The textual changes ventured upon at once called forth\r\ncriticism from the divines of the Sorbonne, and Robert found himself\r\nclassed with the group of heretical persons. It appears from his\r\ncorrespondence that he held himself ready to justify on critical\r\ngrounds the corrections that he had ventured to make in the text of\r\nthe Vulgate. The divines, while continuing their invectives, took\r\npains to avoid any direct controversy on the points at issue.[5] In\r\n1540, Robert was brought into special jeopardy through an impression\r\nof the Decalogue executed in large characters and printed in the\r\nform of a hanging map for placing on the walls of schoolrooms. Such\r\nan undertaking seems to our present understanding innocent enough,\r\nwhether considered from a Romanist or a Protestant point of view, but\r\nin this publication of the Ten Commandments, the divines discovered\r\nlittle less mischief than in the heresies of Luther. The censors caused\r\nto be put into print a counter-impression of the Decalogue in which\r\nthe first two commandments were combined into one, with the omission\r\nof the prohibition of making and worshipping images, while the tenth\r\ncommandment was divided into two in order to make up the complete\r\nnumber. During the same year, various proceedings were taken against\r\nEstienne on the part of the Sorbonne, and on more than one occasion he\r\nwas compelled to leave his home and to betake himself for safety to the\r\nKing’s court. The fact that a publisher, in order to protect himself\r\nagainst the violence of officials who were (at least nominally) the\r\nKing’s censors, should take refuge at court, throws a curious light on\r\nboth the strength and the weakness of the Crown. With all the authority\r\nof the kingdom at his command, Francis was evidently unable to control\r\nthe operations of the ecclesiastical censors who, in their dogmatic and\r\nunruly zeal, did what was in their power to throw the influence of\r\nthe university against the literary development of France and Europe.\r\nOn the other hand, the doctors of the Sorbonne, although backed by\r\nthe authority of Rome, were not strong enough, at least for a number\r\nof years, to put a stop to the publication in Catholic Paris of works\r\nstigmatised by them as dangerously heretical.\r\n\r\nFénelon takes the ground in regard to the use of the Scriptures, that\r\noriginally the Church permitted such reading without restrictions;\r\nthat with increasing degeneracy, restraint was found to be necessary;\r\nthat the necessity became increasingly manifest when the Vaudois, the\r\nAlbigenses, and the later heretics, Wyclif, Luther, Calvin, and their\r\nassociates, utilised the Scriptures as the basis of attacks upon the\r\ntrue Faith and the authority of the Church; Fénelon’s conclusion is:\r\n_Enfin, il ne faut donner l’écriture qu’ à ceux qui, ne la reçevant\r\nque des mains de l’Église, ne veulent y chercher que le sens de\r\nl’Église même_.\r\n\r\nIn 1686, an edition of the New Testament in French was printed at\r\nBordeaux. The edition is described in a tract by Bishop Kidder, printed\r\nin London in 1690, entitled _Reflections on a French Testament_.\r\nThis tract was reprinted in 1827 by Doctor H. Cotton in connection\r\nwith a Memoir of Bishop Kidder. The Bordeaux Testament is described\r\nas rare; but five copies are recorded as having been in existence in\r\nGreat Britain in 1827. The immediate occasion of the production of this\r\nspecial version of the Testament was the revocation, in 1685, of the\r\nEdict of Nantes. Strenuous efforts were made after the revocation, by\r\nthe Church, and by the State acting in co-operation with the Church,\r\nfor the recall to the fold of the various groups of Protestants who\r\nstill remained in the kingdom. The publication, under the authority\r\nof the State, of the volume in question has been referred by Catholic\r\nwriters (including among others Mr. Butler in his _Book of the Roman\r\nCatholic Church_[6]) as a contradiction to the charge that the\r\nChurch was averse to the dissemination of the Scriptures. Mr. Butler\r\nreminds his readers, on the authority of Bausset in his _Life of\r\nBossuet_ that, under the orders of Louis XIV, no less than fifty\r\nthousand copies of the French translation of the New Testament were,\r\n“at the recommendation of Bossuet, distributed among the converted\r\nProtestants.” Bausset refers to this version as being the work of Père\r\nAmelotte, and says that with the Testament were distributed copies\r\nof a translated missal. Mendham points out that among the several\r\npeculiarities specified by Kidder in the Bordeaux version, the more\r\nnoteworthy have to do with references of a special character to the\r\nMass, to Purgatory, and to the Roman Faith, which have been made to\r\nfind place in the text of the Testament. Among the examples cited are\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\nActs xiii, 2, given in the King James version “As they ministered to\r\nthe Lord,” is given in the French version _Comme ils offraient au\r\nSeigneur leurs sacrifices de la Messe_, or “They rendered unto the\r\nLord the sacrifice of the Mass.”\r\n\r\n1 Cor. ii, 15, where the Apostle writes they shall be saved as “by\r\nfire,” this version has _par le feu de Purgatoire_, “by the fire of\r\nPurgatory.”\r\n\r\n1 Tim. iv, 1, “In the latter times,” says St. Paul, “some shall depart\r\nfrom the faith,” is rendered _de la Foy Romaine_, “from the Roman\r\nfaith.”\r\n\r\nThese instances will serve as examples of the character of the\r\naccusations brought by Kidder, Cotton, and Mendham,[7] against the\r\ntrustworthiness and good faith of the Catholic censors who undertook to\r\npresent to the Protestants who were to be recalled to the true Faith\r\nthe doctrine of the Scriptures. It would certainly appear as if the\r\nzeal of these editors had outrun their standard of accurate scholarship.\r\n\r\n\r\n=3. The Netherlands.=--In 1559, Plantin printed a French edition\r\nof the New Testament and found sale within the year for nearly\r\ntwenty-five hundred copies. In 1568, Plantin completed the publication\r\nof the most important of his undertakings, _La Bible Royale_, or\r\n_Bible Polyglotte_, which was produced under the editorship of\r\nthe great scholar Arias Montanus. This was the most scholarly edition\r\nof the Scriptures that had thus far been put into print. A polyglot\r\nBible had been planned by Aldus but he had not lived to complete it. In\r\n1517, the Cardinal Ximenes had had printed at Alcala a polyglot edition\r\nof the Old Testament, and in 1547, an edition of the Pentateuch,\r\nprepared under the supervision of certain Jewish editors, was printed\r\nin Constantinople in Hebrew, Latin, Greek, and Syrian. Plantin secured\r\nfor his Bible from King Philip II a subvention (or at least the promise\r\nof a subvention) of twenty-one thousand florins, which amount was to\r\nbe repaid to the King in copies of the book. The editor Montanus had\r\nhimself been appointed by the King, and he selected as his associates\r\nmembers of the theological faculty of the University of Louvain. The\r\nenterprise received also the co-operation and support of Cardinal\r\nGranvelle.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important, and also one of the most difficult,\r\nparts of the undertaking was the securing of the various privileges\r\nrequired to authorise the sale of the work, and to protect it from\r\ninfringement in the several countries in which a demand for it was\r\nexpected. A general privilege was first obtained from the governor\r\nof the Netherlands acting in behalf of the King, and this secular\r\nauthorisation was supplemented by a certificate of orthodoxy issued by\r\nthe theological faculty of Louvain, which was naturally prepared to\r\napprove of its own work. The Pope, Pius V, or his advisers, took the\r\nground, however, that any general circulation of the Scriptures might\r\nprove dangerous, and in spite of the approval given to the work by\r\nLouvain, he refused to sanction its publication. This refusal blocked\r\nthe undertaking for some years and brought upon the publisher Plantin\r\nserious financial difficulties. The history of this work presents a\r\nconvenient example of the special difficulties attending the publishing\r\nenterprises of the time. The examiners or censors, whether political\r\nor ecclesiastical, were prepared to make their examinations and to\r\narrive at decisions only when the book in question was already in\r\nprinted form. It was necessary, therefore, that the outlays for the\r\nediting, the typesetting, and the printing should be incurred before\r\nthe publisher could ascertain whether or not the publication could be\r\npermitted. It was quite possible also that the plan of the publication\r\nmight be approved by one authority, while the work, when completed,\r\nmight fail to secure the sanction required on the part of some other\r\nor succeeding authority. With Plantin’s Bible, the history took a\r\ndifferent course. Pope Gregory XIII, who succeeded Pius V, was finally\r\npersuaded to give his approval to the work and, in 1572 (that is to\r\nsay four years after the book was in readiness), he issued a privilege\r\nfor it which gave to the publisher exclusive control for the term of\r\ntwenty years, and which brought upon any reprinter excommunication and\r\na fine of two thousand livres. The editor, Montanus, after finishing\r\nhis editorial labours and supervising the printing of the final sheets\r\nof the Bible, was obliged to devote some years to travelling from\r\ncourt to court and to a long sojourn in Rome, before he could secure\r\nthe privileges required for its sale. Even after the work had secured\r\nthe approval of Gregory, it was vigorously attacked by a group of the\r\nstricter Romanists, led by Leon de Castro, professor of Salamanca. De\r\nCastro took the ground that the Vulgate had been accepted by the Church\r\nas the authoritative text, and that all attempts to go back to the\r\noriginal Hebrew, Greek, or Syriac must, therefore, be sacrilegious.\r\nAs early as 1520, Noël Beda, Dean of the Sorbonne, had taken similar\r\nground in connection with the editions of the Bible printed by Henry\r\nEstienne. Beda contended that the study of Greek and Hebrew would bring\r\nreligion into peril, as it would tend to undermine the authority of the\r\nVulgate. When Montanus, after completing his work in Antwerp, returned\r\nto Spain, he was accused of being a partisan of the Jews and an enemy\r\nto the Church, and was threatened with a trial for heresy. He was able,\r\nhowever, through his own scholarship and with the backing of the Pope,\r\nto hold his own against his accusers, and no formal trial ever took\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n=4. Spain.=--The earliest censorship in Spain was undertaken in\r\nAragon and was directed against vernacular versions of the Scriptures.\r\nIn 1234, the Cortes of Tarragona adopted a decree of King Jayme I\r\nforbidding the possession by any one of any portion of the Old or New\r\nTestament in Romance.[8] The Church in the 13th century, as later, was\r\nsatisfied with the Latin Vulgate. It authorised no translation into\r\nmodern tongues and preferred that popular instruction should come from\r\nlearned priests who could explain obscurities in orthodox fashion. The\r\nsects of the Cathari and the Waldenses, whose growth was for a time a\r\nreal danger to the establishment, were ardent students of Scripture\r\nand found in it a potent instrument of propagandism. The Cathari, who\r\nrejected nearly the whole of the Old Testament, had translations of\r\nthe New. The Waldenses had versions of the whole Bible.[9] In Castile,\r\nliterature remained until the 15th century without interference on\r\nthe part of either Church or State. The first instance of general\r\ncensorship of which I find record in Spain was exercised on the library\r\nof the Marquis of Villena, after his death in 1434. The marquis had\r\ndabbled in occult arts and had won the reputation of a magician. At the\r\ncommand of Juan II, his books were examined by Lope de Barrientos, who\r\nby a royal order publicly burned such as were deemed objectionable.\r\n\r\nIn 1479, Pedro de Osma, a professor of Salamanca, was condemned by the\r\nCouncil of Alcala for certain heresies. The professor was required to\r\nmake public recantation holding a lighted candle, and the book in which\r\nhis errors were set forth was burned by the secular authorities. In\r\n1316, the inquisitor, Juan de Llotger, on the report of an assembly\r\nof experts, assembled at Tarragona, condemned the works on spiritual\r\nFranciscanism by Arnaldo de Villanneva. The sentence in which the\r\ntracts were condemned formed the model of a long series of similar\r\nprohibitions. Towards the close of the 14th century, Nicholas Eymerich,\r\nwho won fame as a strenuous inquisitor, secured the condemnation of a\r\nlong series of books including some twenty works by Raymond Lully and\r\nseveral of Ramon de Tarraga.[10] In Castile, during the latter part\r\nof the 13th century, the censorship of the Scriptures was evidently\r\nrelaxed. In 1267, Alfonso X caused a Castilian translation to be made\r\nof the Bible, a copy of which, in five folio volumes, is preserved in\r\nthe Escorial.[11] In 1430, Rabbi Moyses aben Ragel completed the work\r\nof translating the Old Testament which had been undertaken in 1422,\r\nunder the instructions of the Master of Calatrava. He secured for his\r\ntask the aid of certain Franciscans and Dominicans who supplied the\r\nCatholic glosses. An illuminated manuscript of this version still\r\nexists in the collection of Condé, Duke de Olivares.[12] During the\r\n14th and 15th centuries, a number of versions of different portions of\r\nthe Scriptures were executed in Catalan. One of these was prepared by\r\nthe Carthusian, Bonifacio Ferrer. Of this, an edition was printed in\r\n1478 at Valencia, which edition had been revised by the Jesuit, Jayme\r\nBorell. This volume was issued on the eve of a general proscription of\r\nthe Scriptures in the vernacular.\r\n\r\nExcepting for the instance of censorship in Aragon, there appears to\r\nhave been up to the close of the 15th century, no obstacle to the\r\nprinting or the distribution in Spain of versions of the Scriptures\r\nin the vernacular. Carranza, Archbishop of Toledo, writing in 1557,\r\nsays that before Lutheran heresies emerged from hell he knew of no\r\nprohibition of the Bible in the vulgar tongue.[13]\r\n\r\nCardinal Ximenes at first took strong ground against the circulation\r\nof all versions of the Scriptures, and even stopped the work that had\r\nbeen begun by the Archbishop of Granada, in translating into Arabic\r\nthe Scripture text used at the matins and in the mass. In 1519,\r\nhowever, the Cardinal had printed at Alcala a polyglot edition of the\r\nOld Testament, known in bibliographies as the Ximenes Bible. In this\r\nedition, the text of the Vulgate was placed in a column between the\r\ntext in Greek and that in Hebrew. Mendham quotes the Cardinal as saying\r\nthat the arrangement recalled the crucifixion where Christ was placed\r\nbetween two thieves.[14]\r\n\r\nIn 1533, Maria Cazalla, when on trial before the Inquisition, speaks\r\nof its being customary for Catholic women to read portions of the\r\nScriptures in Castilian, and Carranza in his _Comentarios_ complains of\r\nthe “number of female expounders of Scripture who abounded everywhere,”\r\nas an evil to be suppressed.[15] Alfonso de Castro takes the ground\r\nthat from the misinterpretation of the Scriptures spring all heresies;\r\nas the keenest intellect and widest learning are required for their\r\ninterpretation, they must be sedulously kept from the people; reverence\r\nfor the Scriptures would be destroyed if they were allowed to become\r\ncommon.[16] The Spanish Index of 1551 includes among books prohibited,\r\nBibles translated into Spanish or other vulgar tongue. In this year,\r\nValdes issued an edict directed particularly against the importation\r\nof heretical Bibles. In 1554, Valdes issued a special expurgatory\r\nIndex in which were examined fifty-four editions of the Scriptures and\r\nlists of the objectionable passages were given. The owners of these\r\nBibles were required to present them to the inquisitors within sixty\r\ndays in order that the objectionable passages might be obliterated.\r\nIn 1554, was printed at Salamanca the edition of the Bible of Vatable\r\nwhich had been thoroughly expurgated, but this expurgated edition was\r\nprohibited in the Index of 1559. A further expurgation was undertaken\r\nand the second revised edition appeared in 1584. Even this contained\r\nadditional expurgations inserted with the pen. In 1613, and 1632,\r\nthe much revised book endured two further series of expurgations.\r\nIts circulation appears thereafter to have been permitted without\r\nfurther interference. The Bible edited by Montanus and printed in\r\nAntwerp by Plantin, was denounced by de Castro and others as full\r\nof heresies, but the charges do not appear to have been adequately\r\nsupported. The Index of 1583 contains in its general rules a sweeping\r\nprohibition of vernacular Bibles and of all portions thereof. An Edict\r\nof Denunciations, published annually after 1580, classes among works\r\nabsolutely prohibited, the writings of the Lutherans, the Alcoran, and\r\nBibles in the vernacular. It appears to have been the conclusion of the\r\nSpanish censors that the effect of the Bible on the popular mind was on\r\nthe whole more to be dreaded than that of the Koran.[17]\r\n\r\nThe Spanish writer Villanueva has endeavoured to show by extracts\r\nfrom religious authors whose writings were issued between 1550\r\nand 1620, that there was a large body of educated opinion which\r\nfavoured the study of the Scriptures. He finds such utterances from\r\nCarmelites, Franciscans, Benedictines, and even Dominicans. Lea points\r\nout, however, that, with the first quarter of the 17th century, the\r\nauthorities of Villanueva come to an end. The generation which had\r\nwitnessed the prohibition of the Scriptures had died out and the\r\nScriptures themselves were forgotten in the intellectual gymnastics\r\nof casuistry. The work of the Inquisition had been accomplished among\r\nboth priests and people.[18] Villanueva, himself a _calificador_\r\n(councillor) of the Inquisition, writing in 1791, says that the people\r\nare now practically ignorant of the existence of the Scriptures and\r\nthose who have knowledge of such existence regard the Scriptures with\r\nhorror and detestation.[19]\r\n\r\nIn the fifth of the series of the rules in the Index of 1790, the\r\nInquisitor announces that the Church authorities have become sensible\r\nof the benefits to be secured from the perusal of the Scriptures and\r\nthat they are prepared to repeat the declaration given in the Index\r\nof Benedict and to permit, under similar restrictions, the reading\r\nof the Bible in the vernacular. This Index repeats the condemnation\r\nfirst published in the preceding Index of 1747, and withdrawn under\r\nthe protest of Pope Benedict, of the _History of Pelagianism_ by\r\nCardinal Noris.\r\n\r\nThe Protestants had little success in getting into Spain their great\r\nweapon of attack, a vernacular Bible, little I mean compared with their\r\nsuccess in Italy. The Spanish Bible upon which they chiefly relied is\r\nthe one of 1602 which was prepared by Cypriano de Valera, but which,\r\nin fact, is a second edition, much improved, of that of Cassiodoro de\r\nReyna, printed in 1559, which in its turn used for the Old Testament\r\nthe Jewish Bible in Spanish, printed at Ferrara in 1553. De Reyna was\r\na native of Seville and had been educated at the university there.\r\nBecoming a heretic, he escaped from Spain about 1557 and went first\r\nto London and then to Basel, where, with the aid of the Senate, he\r\npublished his Bible in 1559.\r\n\r\nIn 1836–37, the Cortes made an attempt to reconcile the liberty of the\r\npress with the repression of certain abuses. It was at this time that\r\nGeorge Borrow undertook to test the censorship conditions in Spain, by\r\nprinting and circulating the New Testament. Lea points out[20] that he\r\nutilised for his work a version prepared from the Vulgate by Father\r\nScio and that he was, therefore, presenting Scriptures which were\r\nentirely orthodox. Borrow succeeded in having an edition of his New\r\nTestament printed in Madrid and in opening a shop for its sale. With\r\na change of ministry, the sale was blocked and Borrow was for a few\r\nweeks placed in prison. Later, his supplies of books were seized and\r\ncancelled.[21] The later issues of the Bible Society for circulation in\r\nSpain are reprints of the translation by de Valera. The constitution of\r\n1876 gives to all Spaniards the right to express freely in speech or\r\nin print their ideas and opinions without subjection to a preliminary\r\ncensorship. Article XI concedes liberty of thought and belief.[22]\r\n\r\nIn an encyclical letter of Leo XII, written to Spain in 1824, occur the\r\nfollowing passages:\r\n\r\n   “A certain sect not unknown certainly to you, usurping to\r\n   itself undeservedly the name of Philosophy, has raked from\r\n   the ashes disorderly crowds of almost every error. This sect,\r\n   exhibiting the meek appearance of piety and liberality,\r\n   professes Latitudinarianism or Indifferentism.... You are\r\n   aware, venerable Brothers, that a certain society, commonly\r\n   called the Bible Society, strolls with effrontery throughout\r\n   the world; which society, contemning the traditions of the Holy\r\n   Fathers and contrary to the well-known decree of the Council\r\n   of Trent, labours with all its might and by every means, to\r\n   translate--or rather to pervert--the Holy Bible into the vulgar\r\n   languages of every nation; from which proceeding it is greatly\r\n   to be feared that what is ascertained to have happened as to\r\n   some passages may occur with regard to others; to wit that,\r\n   by a perverse interpretation, the Gospel of Christ be turned\r\n   into a human Gospel, or, which is still worse, into the Gospel\r\n   of the Devil (Hier. Cap. I, _Ep. ad. Gal._). To avert this\r\n   plague, our predecessors published many ordinances.... We also,\r\n   venerable Brothers, in conformity with our Apostolic duty,\r\n   exhort you to turn away your flock, by all means, from these\r\n   poisonous pastures. Reprove, beseech, be instant in season\r\n   and out of season, in all patience and doctrine, that the\r\n   faithful entrusted to you (adhering strictly to the rules of\r\n   our Congregation of the Index) be persuaded that if the Sacred\r\n   Scriptures be everywhere indiscriminately public, more evil\r\n   than advantage will arise thence, on account of the rashness\r\n   of men.... Behold then the tendency of this Society, which, to\r\n   attain its ends, leaves nothing untried. Not only does it print\r\n   its translations, but wandering through the towns and cities, it\r\n   delights in distributing these among the crowd. Nay, to allure\r\n   the minds of the simple, at one it sells them, at another with\r\n   an insidious liberality it bestows them. Again, therefore, we\r\n   exhort you that your courage fail not. The power of temporal\r\n   princes, will, we trust in the Lord, come to your assistance,\r\n   whose interest, as reason and experience show, is concerned when\r\n   the authority of the Church is questioned.”[23]\r\n\r\n\r\n=5. England.= The Synod of Canterbury, held at Oxford in 1408,\r\nforbids the translation into English under individual authority\r\n(_auctoritate sua_) of any portion of the Scriptures. It further\r\nforbids, under penalty of the greater excommunication, the reading or\r\nthe possession (except with the approval of the bishop or provincial\r\ncouncil) of any versions of the Scriptures which had been issued since\r\nthe time of Wyclif, or which might thereafter be issued.[24] This\r\nprohibition appears not to have been very thoroughly enforced. Sir\r\nThomas More speaks of seeing old versions of the Bible in the hands\r\nof the laity, without criticism from the bishops.[25] It is the case,\r\nhowever, that, between 1408 and 1525, the date of Tyndale’s Bible, no\r\nEnglish version of the Scriptures was printed.\r\n\r\nThe first Bible published in England was Tyndale’s English version of\r\nthe New Testament. This was, however, printed not in England but in\r\nCologne at the press of Quentell. Tyndale was by birth a Welshman.\r\nAfter studying in Oxford and in Cambridge, he sojourned in Antwerp\r\nand in that city he completed, in the year 1525, with the assistance\r\nof John Fryth and Joseph Royes, his translation of the New Testament.\r\nThe supplies of the book when forwarded to London, came into immediate\r\ndemand, but as soon as the ecclesiastical authorities had an\r\nopportunity of examining the text, the book was put under ban and all\r\ncopies that could be found were seized and destroyed. At the instance\r\nof Catholic ecclesiastics in England, Tyndale was, in 1536, arrested\r\nat Antwerp, under the authority of the Emperor Charles V and after\r\nbeing imprisoned for eighteen months, was burned. In 1535, a complete\r\nEnglish Bible, comprising Tyndale’s version of the New Testament and\r\nthe Pentateuch and a translation, prepared by Coverdale and others, of\r\nthe remaining books of the Old Testament, was printed somewhere on the\r\nContinent, probably at Zurich by Trochsover.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the freedom of the English press and for the spread of\r\nreligious belief through the instruction of the Scriptures, it happened\r\nthat shortly after the completion of the Coverdale Bible, Henry VIII\r\nwanted to marry Anne Boleyn. With the close of the supremacy of the\r\npapal power in England, and with the addition of Great Britain to the\r\nlist of the countries accepting the principles of the Reformation,\r\nthe printing and the distribution of the English versions of the\r\nScriptures became practicable. It would not be correct to say that\r\nfrom this date the printing-press of England was free, but it was\r\nthe case that it became free for the production of the Protestant\r\nScriptures and of other Protestant literature, while it was also the\r\ncase that the censorship put in force by the English ecclesiastics, or\r\nby the authority of the State, never proved as severe or as serious an\r\nobstacle to publishing as had been the case with the ecclesiastical\r\ncensorship of the Catholics.\r\n\r\nThe first English Bible printed in England was the translation of John\r\nHollybushe, which was issued in 1538 by John Nicholson, in Southwark.\r\nThe great Cranmer Bible was printed between 1539 and 1541, the funds\r\nfor its publication being supplied by Cranmer and Cromwell. The\r\nmagnificent illustrations are ascribed to Holbein.\r\n\r\nWhen the Scriptures were no longer interdicted in England, the printers\r\nthemselves began at once to supply reasons why certain of their\r\neditions should be suppressed. In the year 1631, in a Bible and Prayer\r\nBook printed in London by R. Barker, the word “not” was omitted in the\r\nseventh commandment. This discovery led to a further examination of\r\nthe edition and it was stated by Laud that no less than one thousand\r\nmistakes were found in this and in another edition issued by the same\r\nprinters. The impressions of both books were destroyed and the printers\r\nwere condemned by the High Commission to be fined two thousand pounds,\r\na condemnation which naturally ruined their business.\r\n\r\n\r\n=6. The Reading of the Scriptures in the Vernacular.=--The various\r\nProtestant versions of the Scriptures were prohibited in so far as\r\nthey came to the knowledge of the Inquisition or the Congregation. The\r\nsame course was taken with a number of translations into the language\r\nof the people, which were the work of good Catholics. In 1668, the\r\nNew Testament of Mons was condemned by a brief of Clement IX; and in\r\naddition to the New Testament text with the commentaries of Quesnel,\r\nwere prohibited French versions that had been prepared by Sinori and\r\nby Hure and a Dutch translation by Schurius. A number of editions\r\nfor popular use escaped prohibition and some of these secured a very\r\nwide circulation; but in Italy, in Spain, and in Portugal, a general\r\nregulation was kept in force prohibiting any reading of the Scriptures\r\nin the language of the people. In the last decade of the 17th century,\r\nthe question of the use of the Scriptures by the unlearned brought\r\nabout some active controversies. The Jansenists maintained from the\r\noutset that the fourth of the Ten Rules of the Index of Trent was\r\nnot to be accepted as binding. This question brought into the Index\r\na number of controversial writings of the time, and in the Bull\r\n_Unigenitus_ were condemned a series of specific propositions,\r\na condemnation which carried with it the prohibition of any works in\r\nwhich could be identified the doctrines contained in the propositions.\r\n\r\nIn the Index of Benedict XIV, Rule IV, cited from the Trent Index,\r\nis printed, with an addition based upon a decree issued by the\r\nCongregation of the Index in June, 1757:\r\n\r\nPermission can be given for the use of versions of the Scriptures or\r\nof portions of the Scriptures printed in the language of the people,\r\nwhen these versions have been prepared by devout and learned Catholics\r\nor have been issued with commentaries or annotations selected from the\r\nwritings of the Fathers of the Church, and when said editions have been\r\nspecifically approved by the Holy See. For the reading of all editions\r\nnot carrying such specific approval, permission must be secured in each\r\nindividual case.\r\n\r\nThis modification of Rule IV was, however, itself revoked under\r\nGregory XVI through a _Monitum_ issued by the Congregation of the Index\r\nin January, 1836, which _Monitum_ has, since 1841, been printed in the\r\nsuccessive issues of the Index.\r\n\r\n   “It has come to the knowledge of the authorities of the\r\n   Congregation that, in certain places, editions of the\r\n   Scriptures, printed in the language of the people, have been\r\n   brought into circulation without reference to the restrictions\r\n   and regulations imposed by the Church. The Congregation recalls\r\n   therefore to believers that, according to the decree of 1757,\r\n   only such versions of the Scriptures can be permitted which have\r\n   secured the specific approval of the Holy See. For all other\r\n   editions of the Scriptures the provisions of Rule IV must be\r\n   enforced.”\r\n\r\nIn 1699, a provincial synod of Naples had declared that editions of the\r\nScriptures in the vernacular were not to be possessed or read, even\r\nwith the authorisation of the bishops, because an Apostolic mandate\r\nhad taken from the bishops the authority to grant such permission. The\r\neditions of the Scriptures prepared by the Catholic divines for the use\r\nof the faithful appear for the great part to have been made up with\r\ncarefully selected citations, the selections being restricted to the\r\nportions which were not doctrinal. Care was taken also to omit certain\r\nof the stories and historical episodes in the Old Testament which were\r\nconsidered to be not edifying or wholesome in their teaching. Hilgers\r\ncontends that under the present policy of the Church, each Catholic\r\nis, as far as the Church is concerned, at liberty to utilise in his\r\nhome reading the text of the entire Bible. The spiritual protectors of\r\nthe faithful emphasise, however, the importance of securing for each\r\ndivision of the Scriptures the interpretation of the Church and the\r\nguidance of those who are made responsible for the shaping of sound\r\ndoctrine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n             THE MONASTIC ORDERS AND CENSORSHIP, 1600–1800\r\n\r\n    1. The Monastic Orders                1600–1800.\r\n    2. The Jesuits                        1650–1800.\r\n    3. The Dominicans                     1510–1600.\r\n    4. The Casuists                       1600–1610.\r\n    5. The Seculars and the Regulars      1600–1700.\r\n\r\n\r\n=1. Writings on the Monastic Orders.=--The Index contains the\r\ntitles of a long series of writings having to do with the Orders of\r\nthe Church. Certain of these are controversial in character, raising\r\ncontentions against the whole system of the Orders or against the work\r\nor the character of particular Orders. The larger portion of the number\r\nare, however, the work of members of the Orders who have undertaken, in\r\nan exaggerated and improper manner, to maintain unfounded claims for\r\ntheir own Orders or to point out the defects of their rivals, or which\r\nare devoted to petty differences and strifes that have arisen between\r\nthe Orders. The _Decreta Gen._, ii, 12, contain a prohibition,\r\ndated 1568, of the printing or of the distribution in written form of\r\nany works that have not secured the approval of the Index Congregation,\r\nwhich have to do with the controversy concerning the actual succession\r\nof the Sons of St. Francis, or concerning the detail of the true\r\nform of the hood worn by the saint. The _Decreta Gen._, iii, 8,\r\nprint the prohibition, issued in 1663, of all reproductions of the\r\ninscriptions on the pictures of St. Francis and St. Antonio of Padua,\r\nwhich inscriptions may undertake to specify the form of the garments\r\nworn by the saints or in which any reference may be made to the true\r\nand legitimate succession from these saints.\r\n\r\nThe Index also contains the series of works having to do with the long\r\ncontests between the Franciscans and the Dominicans, the Augustine\r\nhermits and the Augustine choristers, the Augustine choristers and\r\nthe Benedictines, the Benedictines and the Hieronymites (followers\r\nof St. Jerome), the Mercedarians and the Trinitarians. The list also\r\nincludes certain writings presenting the traditions or records of\r\nthe Carmelites. In 1698, Innocent XII issued a general prohibition\r\nin regard to the printing or the distribution of the whole group of\r\nwritings concerning the controversies of the Orders.[26]\r\n\r\nThe long contest carried on between the Carmelites and the Jesuits\r\nbrought about the condemnation in Spain, in 1695, the _Acta\r\nSanctorum_ of the Bollandists, printed in fourteen volumes.\r\nThis prohibition was recalled in 1715. In Rome only one volume was\r\nprohibited and this on another ground. In 1755, was prohibited a work\r\nissued under the title of _Ordres Monastiques; Histoires extraites\r\nde tous les auteurs qui ont conservé à la postérité ce qu’il y a de\r\nplus curieux dans chaque ordre_. The work, printed in 1751 in seven\r\nvolumes, bears the imprint of Berlin but was supposed as a matter of\r\nfact to have been issued in Paris. It was ascribed to the Abbé Musson.\r\nThe _Pragmatische Geschichte der vornehmsten Mönchsorden_, printed\r\nin Leipsic in 1774, in ten volumes, was based upon the _Histoires_\r\nof Musson.\r\n\r\n\r\n=2. The Jesuits, 1650–1800.=--Books written by, and books concerning,\r\nthe Jesuits make a considerable group among the dogmatic and\r\ncontroversial works in the Index. In 1659, Alexander VII issues a\r\ndecree condemning a treatise which had been issued anonymously, in\r\nParis, under the title, _Apologie pour les Casuistes contre les\r\ncalomnies des Jansénistes_. In 1689, Innocent XI condemns forty-five\r\npropositions, cited from Jesuit works; and in 1690, he issues a\r\ndecree against the Jesuit doctrine of philosophical sin. Of the books\r\nwritten against the doctrines and the practices of the Order, the\r\nmost important are those by Mariana, Scotti, Pasquelin, and other\r\nex-Jesuits, by the Capucin, Valerianus Magni, by Arnauld (the elder),\r\nPasquier, and Scioppius. The great mass of Protestant writings against\r\nthe Order are hardly represented. Scotti, whose catalogue name is\r\nJulius Clemens Scotus, had become a Jesuit in 1616. In 1664, he\r\nabandoned the Order and later secured a chair in Padua as professor of\r\nphilosophy and of ecclesiastical law. The treatise which was condemned\r\nin 1651, was issued under the title of _De potestate pontificia in\r\nsocietatem Jesu ... ad Innocentium X, etc._ Scioppius comes into\r\nthe Index in connection with a volume entitled _Infamia Famiani_,\r\nprohibited in 1687. The following treatises which were also his work\r\nbut which were published anonymously, were condemned in 1682: _Actio\r\nperduellis in Jesuitas S. Rom. Imperii juratos hostes, Anatomia Soc._\r\n_Jesu seu probatio spiritus Jesuitarum._ A third book in the list\r\nwas also attributed to Scioppius, _Mysteria Patrum Jesuitarum_. In\r\n1725, was forbidden a treatise bearing the rather vague title _Cura\r\nSalutis, sive de statu vitae mature ac prudenter deliberandi methodus_.\r\nIt had been published in Vienna in 1712, and had been utilised as\r\na proselyting tract in behalf of the Jesuit Order. In 1646, was\r\nforbidden in Spain a volume by the Jesuit Solier, printed in Poitiers,\r\nunder the title of _Trois très excellentes prédications prononcées au\r\njour et fête de la béatification du glorieux patriarche le bien-heureux\r\nIgnace_. The volume had been denounced before the Sorbonne by the\r\nSpanish Dominican Gallardo as scandalous, blasphemous, and heretical.\r\nAs an example of the blasphemy, Gallardo cites a sentence in which\r\nthe author claims that Ignatius had, with a piece of paper bearing\r\nhis written name, worked more miracles than Moses and as many as the\r\nApostles. In 1752, was placed upon the Index a volume by Marcus Fridl,\r\npresenting a record of the miraculous life of Mary Ward, founder of\r\nthe English Society of the _Jesuitissae_. With this, was condemned\r\nanother biography of Mary Ward by Unterberg, printed in Tübingen in\r\n1735, and an account of the Order by Khamms. The Order had been founded\r\nin England early in the 17th century on the model of the Order of the\r\nJesuits. The counsellor of Mary Ward’s _Jesuitissae_ was the Jesuit\r\nRoger Lee. The Order never secured an authorisation or confirmation\r\nfrom the Pope, but houses of it were established in Belgium, Germany,\r\nand Italy. In 1636, the principal and her chief assistants were\r\narrested and brought to Rome where, after a trial, their Order was\r\nformally condemned and they were then released. New houses were,\r\nhowever, shortly after instituted in England and one in Munich, and, in\r\n1703, the rules of the Order were approved and confirmed by Clement XI\r\nat the instance of the Elector of Bavaria.\r\n\r\nTwenty years after the condemnation of the teachings of Michael Bajus,\r\narose in Spain the controversy between the Jesuits and the Dominicans\r\nconcerning the doctrine of Grace. The leading representative of the\r\nlatter was Domingo Bañez of Salamanca (†1604) and of the Jesuits, Luis\r\nMolina, professor at Evera (†1600). The issues were referred to Rome\r\nmore immediately in connection with the treatise by Molina, _Concordia\r\nliberi arbitrii cum gratiae donis_, which had been denounced by the\r\nDominicans, and, between 1602 and 1606, a series of disputations were\r\ncarried on under the direction of Clement VIII and of Paul V at the\r\nsessions of the Congregation _de Auxiliis_. In December, 1611, a decree\r\nof Paul V prohibits the printing thereafter, without the specific\r\nauthorisation of the Inquisition, of any writing having to do with the\r\ncontest. This decree was confirmed by Urban VIII in 1625 and 1641,\r\nand again by Alexander VII in 1657. The latter added a prohibition\r\nfor the printing, without the approval of the Inquisition, of any\r\nwritings which were concerned with the _materia auxiliorum divinorum\r\nex professo_, or which brought this subject-matter into print in\r\nconnection with commentaries on the writings of Thomas Aquinas. This\r\ngeneral prohibition is entered in Alexander’s Index under the term\r\n_libri_ and, since the time of Benedict, finds place in the _Decreta\r\nGen._, ii, 1. Under the terms of the _Decreta_, all writings under this\r\nheading, printed since 1657 without a specific approval, are to be held\r\nas condemned. The Index contains, however, but three specific titles\r\nand these of comparatively insignificant monographs. Reusch points out\r\nthat the bitter controversial treatises of the Dominican, Hyacinth\r\nSerry, and of the Jesuit, Livinus de Meyer, failed to be recorded in\r\nthe Index.[27]\r\n\r\nAmong the Jesuits whose writings secured special attention on the\r\npart of the Index authorities were J. B. Poza (†1660) and Théophile\r\nRaynaud (†1663). Poza, who was a native of Bilboa, printed in 1626\r\nat Alcala, under the title of _Elucidarium Deiparae_, a treatise that\r\nis described as one of the very worst among the many books concerning\r\nthe Virgin. This volume was prohibited by the Congregation of the\r\nIndex in 1628, and as a result of Poza’s bitter protests against the\r\naction of the Congregation, a prohibition was issued in 1632 covering\r\nall of his writings. In Poza’s contentions against the judgment of\r\nthe Roman authorities, he had the support of the Spanish Inquisition,\r\nwhich refused to confirm both the individual and the general Roman\r\nprohibition. Raynaud, born in 1583 near Nizza, became a Jesuit in 1602.\r\nHe was a scholar and an active writer. He first came into conflict\r\nwith the Congregation in connection with a bitter satire against the\r\nDominican theories of the doctrine of Grace. Shortly thereafter, was\r\ncondemned a monograph of his written to oppose the view that those who\r\ndied of pestilence were to be held as martyrs. In 1659, was prohibited\r\na monograph of Raynaud on the ecclesiastical system of censorship.\r\nThereupon he published, under a pseudonym, a satire treating of the\r\ncontrol exercised by the Dominicans over the Inquisition, which was\r\npromptly placed on the Index.\r\n\r\nClement X, who is classed as favouring the Jesuits, found occasion\r\nto condemn a number of treatises written in defence of Berruyer’s\r\n_Historia Populi Dei_. This work was prohibited in Spain, 1759\r\n(see also p. 42). Under Benedict XIV and during the first years of\r\nClement XIII, were placed upon the Index a long series of publications\r\nwritten in opposition to the Jesuits.\r\n\r\nAmong the works antagonistic to the Jesuits which were prohibited\r\nduring the decade after 1750 may be mentioned the following: Quesnel,\r\n_Histoire des Religieux de la Compagnie de Jésus_, Utrecht, 1741;\r\n_Procès contre les Jesuites, pour servir de suite aux causes Célèbres_,\r\nBrest, 1750; Mesnier (†1761), _Problême Historique, qui des Jésuites ou\r\nde Luther ou de Calvin ont le plus nui à l’Église Chrétienne_, Utrecht,\r\n1758; de Silva, _Histoire de l’Admirable Don Inigo de Guipuscoa,\r\nChevalier de la Vierge_, The Hague, 1738.\r\n\r\nThe author of the _History of the Jesuits_ (published in London\r\nin 1816, and ascribed to John Poynder) writes: “The doctrine of\r\nprobability, our ignorance of the law of nature, and the necessity\r\nof actual reflection upon the quality of an action in order to its\r\nbecoming sinful, are the foundations upon which the moral corruption of\r\nthe Jesuits is built.”[28]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Jesuits in France, 1610–1625]\r\n\r\nIn 1610, the treatise of Mariana, already referred to, was burned in\r\nParis under the command of the Parliament. The condemnation was on\r\nthe ground of the doctrine maintained by Mariana that, under certain\r\nconditions, there rested with the people the right to slay a tyrant.\r\nDuring the succeeding fifteen years, a number of the works by leading\r\nJesuit writers, such as Bellarmin, Suarez, Santarelli, etc., were\r\nprohibited by the Parliament or by the Sorbonne or by both. The ground\r\nfor the condemnation of this group of books was the assertion of the\r\nright of the pope to depose princes and generally to control the\r\nauthority of the State. In 1613, Paul V directed the Index Congregation\r\nto prohibit with a _d.c._ a treatise by Becanus, in order, as\r\nwas stated, to prevent the total condemnation of this treatise by the\r\nauthorities in Paris. Curiously enough, however, the volume by Becanus\r\nis not included in the Index of Paul or in any later lists. The decree\r\nitself appears to have been cancelled. In 1612, was placed in the\r\nIndex a treatise entitled _Anti-Coton_ which had been written to\r\noppose the writings of the Jesuit Coton. The latter had undertaken,\r\nafter the condemnation of the work of Mariana, a fresh defence of the\r\ndoctrines of his Order. In 1603, Clement VIII ordered the condemnation\r\nof a treatise by the Italian Carerius, a writer who had undertaken to\r\noppose the teaching of Bellarmin in regard to the authority of the pope\r\nin matters of State. The same Pope caused to be removed from the Index\r\nthe treatise of Bellarmin which had been condemned under Sixtus V.\r\n\r\nIn 1665, was published in Lyons a collected edition of Raynaud’s works\r\ncomprising no less than nineteen folio volumes. This set does not\r\ninclude the prohibited writings; but, in 1669, the Jesuits issued, with\r\na false imprint, a twentieth volume bearing the title _Apopompaeus_\r\n(scape-goat, _see_ Levit. xvi., 10). In this volume are presented the\r\nseveral prohibited writings together with certain others. The book was\r\nduly prohibited in 1672.\r\n\r\nIn 1739, the Congregation prohibits the _Opera Electa_ and _Opera\r\nVaria_ of the learned Jesuit Hardouin (1646–1729), and, in 1742, his\r\nCommentary on the New Testament. The _Opera Electa_ had been published\r\nas far back as 1709, and had been promptly condemned by the authorities\r\nof the Jesuit Order. The _Opera Varia_ appeared after the death of the\r\nauthor; for these also the Jesuit rulers disavowed responsibility.\r\nThe works of Hardouin do not appear in the Spanish Index. In 1734,\r\nthe Congregation prohibited a _History of the People of God_ which\r\nwas the work of Berruyer (1681–1758), a pupil of Hardouin. The first\r\npart of this history had been issued in 1728 with the approval\r\nof the French rulers of the Order, but under the decision of the\r\ngeneral of the Order, it was recalled for revision. The second part,\r\npublished in 1753, was disavowed by the Jesuit rulers as having been\r\nissued without their permission, and Berruyer was obliged, under the\r\ncondemnatory decision of the Archbishop of Paris, given in 1754, and\r\nof the Parliament, given in 1756, to make recantation of certain of\r\nthe statements contained in the volume and to promise to cancel the\r\noriginal issue and to correct the text. The third division of the\r\nhistory was issued in 1757, and this secured condemnation through a\r\nbrief of Clement XIII.\r\n\r\nAfter the middle of the 16th century, the most important influence\r\nworking against the freedom of the press and the undertakings of the\r\npublishers was that of the Jesuits. Members of the Order secured\r\npositions as councillors with the imperial Government in Vienna,\r\nwith the Elector of Bavaria, and in other Catholic States, and\r\npromptly brought their influence to bear to strengthen the censorship\r\nregulations. The publication of books lessened or became active almost\r\nin direct proportion to the extent of the Jesuit influence in one State\r\nor another.\r\n\r\nUnder the reign of Clement XIII (1758–1769), there came into print a\r\nlong series of controversial writings directed against the Order of\r\nthe Jesuits, but of these only a small number of titles were placed\r\nupon the Clementine Indexes. In a brief issued in September, 1762, the\r\nPope says that he has caused to be condemned as invalid the edicts\r\nand orders issued by the Parliament of Paris against the Jesuits;\r\nbut these orders do not find place in Index lists. Under Clement XIV\r\n(1769–1774), no single one of the writings against the Jesuits was\r\nprohibited. Under Pius VI (1775–1799), was prohibited but a single and\r\ncomparatively unimportant monograph of the long series of memorials\r\nwritten by Jesuits concerning the suppression of their Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n=3. The Dominicans.=--As stated in an earlier chapter, the work\r\nof the Congregation of the Index had, from the outset, been left very\r\nlargely under the direction of the Dominicans. After the beginning\r\nof the 16th century, the Dominicans came into practical control of\r\nthe censorship operations in Germany, excepting only in Vienna where\r\nthe influence of the Jesuits prevailed. In 1510, under the direction\r\nof these Dominican censors, a strenuous attempt was made to suppress\r\naltogether the literature of the Jews. The influence of the censors was\r\ndirected not merely against instruction in Hebrew in the university\r\ncentres, but against the printing, for the use of the Jews themselves,\r\nof editions of the Jewish Scriptures, the Jewish commentaries, or of\r\nany works by Jewish writers. The fight led by Reuchlin in behalf of\r\nHebrew literature was really a fight for the freedom of the press.\r\nReuchlin, with the all-valuable aid of Erasmus, had in view more\r\nparticularly the interests of scholarship, but the principles asserted\r\nby him and in the end successfully maintained, were those upon which\r\ndepended the intellectual freedom of the people, of the more common\r\nfolk as well as scholars. The fight of Reuchlin against the Dominicans\r\nled by Pfefferkorn was a hundred and thirty years in advance of the\r\npublication of Milton’s _Areopagitica_, but the arguments shaped\r\nby Reuchlin and by Erasmus were substantially identical with those\r\npresented so eloquently by Milton. In 1512, Reuchlin’s treatise\r\nentitled _Augenspiegel_ was prohibited by the emperor and this\r\nprohibition was confirmed in 1520 by the pope (Leo X). In 1515,\r\n_Epistolae obscurorum virorum_, a work which exerted an important\r\ninfluence in the Protestant contest, secured the honour of prohibition\r\nboth from the emperor and from the pope.\r\n\r\n\r\n=4. The Casuists.=--In 1602, under the direction of Clement VIII, the\r\nInquisition formally condemned the opinion that under any circumstances\r\nconfession could be made other than in person, that is to say by\r\nletter or by messenger, and that a confession other than in person\r\ncould secure absolution. The publication of this conclusion appears to\r\nconstitute the first example of a decision by the Roman Inquisition\r\nsecuring general distribution and enforcement. As a result of this\r\ndecree, were placed upon the Index treatises by the Jesuits Henriquez\r\nand Sa (books which contained, to be sure, other opinions that called\r\nforth disapproval) and a work by Vivaldus. The latter came under the\r\nd.c. class. Certain writings of F. Suarez, one of the most noted\r\ntheologians of the Jesuits, were thoroughly discussed and, according to\r\nreport, escaped the Index only by a close vote. During the following\r\nten years, a considerable series of writings by Jesuits found their\r\nway into the Index, in part, however, with the _d.c._ addition. Among\r\nnames to be noted are those of St. Bauny and Fra. Amico, who rank\r\nwith the more important of the advocates of the Jesuit morality, and\r\nwith these a number of treatises by the Theatins, Vidal, Verricelli,\r\nand Pasqualigo. Suarez had defended strongly the contention that\r\nthere was authority for accepting confession from one absent and for\r\ngiving to the same absolution. He based his argument in part upon an\r\ninterpretation of Thomas Aquinas. A series of investigations were held\r\nin Spain concerning these teachings of Suarez and it was ordered by\r\nthe Inquisition (which was under the control of the Dominicans) that\r\nhe should be suspended from his functions and that the distribution\r\nof the books should be stopped until they had been amended. In 1604,\r\nSuarez came to Rome and presented, first before Clement VIII and later\r\nbefore Paul V, the defence of his opinions. The Inquisition of Rome\r\ndecided that the opinions of Suarez were unsound and ordered him to\r\nhave his treatise corrected. The book escaped therefore being entered\r\nin the Index. The treatise by Sa was condemned not merely on account of\r\nits teachings concerning the confession but on other grounds. The title\r\nreads _Aphorisma conf. hactenus impressa_, etc. An expurgated edition,\r\napproved by Brasichelli, was printed in Rome in 1608. The condemnation\r\nof the original work was never confirmed in the Spanish Indexes.\r\n\r\n\r\n=5. Contests between the “Seculars” and the “Regulars,”\r\n1600–1700.=--With the beginning of the 17th century, fierce\r\ncontests arose concerning the relation of the regular Orders to the\r\nbishops. The authorities of the Orders claimed that they held their\r\nresponsibilities directly from the pope and that the work of their\r\nOrders was to be carried on free from the interference of the bishops.\r\nA number of the bishops, on the other hand, took the ground that\r\nthey were themselves the territorial representatives of the central\r\nauthority of the Church in their own dioceses and that, without\r\ndirect authorisation from the bishop, no member of an Order could be\r\npermitted to exercise in the diocese clerical functions. Dr. Richard\r\nSmith, who, under the title of Bishop of Chalcedon, had been appointed\r\nApostolic Vicar for England, took active part in a controversy with\r\ncertain Jesuit writers in maintaining the authority of the bishops.\r\nAs a result of the antagonisms raised by his writings, he was obliged,\r\nin 1628, to leave England, and until his death in 1655, he remained\r\nin France. Among the French writers who took part in the controversy\r\nwere François Hallier and Jean du Vergier de Hauranne, later abbé\r\nof Saint-Cyran. In 1633, the Index Congregation condemned all the\r\ncontroversial writings that had come into print concerning the issues\r\nbetween the Bishop of Chalcedon and the English Regulars. To this\r\ncondemnation was added the specification that the Congregation had not\r\nundertaken to express any decision in regard to the issues involved.\r\nThe continuance of the controversy was, however, considered undesirable\r\nand a general prohibition, under the penalty of the excommunication\r\n_latae sententiae_, was made of any further writing in regard to\r\nthe matter. This prohibition did not succeed, however, in preventing\r\nthe publication of a number of further treatises on the subject, and\r\nwas itself placed in the Index, and, since Benedict XIV, remains in\r\nthe _Decreta Gen._, ii, 4. In 1642, a special prohibition with a\r\n_d.c._ was issued for the volume by the Jesuit Cellot. In 1659,\r\nthe Inquisition formally condemned the writings of a number of the\r\nFrench representatives of the Regulars, including certain treatises\r\nof Bishop Arnauld of Angers. At the same time, were condemned the\r\nreplies to these writings. Shortly afterwards, were placed on the\r\nIndex a treatise by Chassaing written in behalf of the Regulars and\r\none by de Launoy maintaining the claims of the Seculars. In 1664, the\r\nSorbonne censured a monograph that had been printed under the name\r\nof Jacques Vernant, in which large claims were made not only for the\r\nprivileges of the Regulars but also for the general authority of the\r\nPapacy; in 1665, this censorship of the Sorbonne was itself separately\r\ncondemned in a brief issued by Alexander VII. In 1693, was prohibited a\r\ntreatise by the magistrate Karg, dedicated to the Bishop of Bamberg and\r\nWurzburg, which took ground against the privileges of the Orders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                       ROMAN INDEXES, 1758–1899\r\n\r\n    1. Index of Benedict XIV                1758.\r\n    2. Issues of the Roman Index       1763–1899.\r\n\r\n\r\n=1. Index of Benedict XIV, 1758.=--In 1758, an Index was compiled\r\nunder the direction of Benedict XIV which is of importance as marking a\r\nnew departure in the censorship policy of the Church. The accompanying\r\npapal brief, which bears date December 23, 1757, states that the\r\nIndexes heretofore issued are in various respects incorrect, and that\r\nthe present work has been prepared in order to place at the service\r\nof the faithful trustworthy lists of the books prohibited. In a Bull,\r\nissued as far back as July, 1753, the Index Congregation had been\r\ncharged with the duty of the compilation, and five years had been\r\ndevoted to the task. The Index was printed at once in two editions, one\r\ncontaining pp. xxxix-268, and the other pp. xxxvi-304. The title-page\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n_Index Librorum prohibitorum SSmi D.N. Benedicti XIV, Pontificis\r\nMaximi, jussu Recognitus atque editus. Romae 1758, ex typographia\r\nreverendae Camerae Apostolicae. cum summi Pontificis privilegio._\r\n\r\nBoth editions contain a copper plate vignette. The papal brief is\r\nfollowed by an introduction by Thomas Augustus Ricchini, Secretary\r\nof the Congregation; the Tridentine Rules with the commentaries of\r\nClement VIII and Alexander VII, together with a new note on Rule IV (on\r\nthe reading of the Scriptures); the Instruction of Clement; the Bull\r\nof 1753, and a summary (peculiar to this Index) entitled: _Decreta de\r\nlibris prohibitis nec in Indice expressis_. Such summaries are in later\r\nIndexes entitled _Decreta Generalia_. In the preface to the _Decreta_,\r\nit is explained that as, on account of the increasing mass of printed\r\nbooks, it is no longer possible to present all the titles in the lists,\r\nit has seemed best to classify these into certain general divisions or\r\ncategories, and to shape general regulations based upon the subjects\r\ntreated or on the general character of the literature, which shall\r\nserve as guides to the faithful, who with this aid need have no\r\ndifficulty in determining for a book not specifically catalogued,\r\nwhether or not it belongs to one of the prohibited classes. In the\r\neditor’s introduction, Ricchini says: “In the arrangement of the lists,\r\nthe family names rather than the forenames of the writers have been\r\nfollowed as far as practicable. In the previous Indexes, the forenames\r\nwere utilised for the main entry, with occasional cross-references\r\nto the family name. We have accepted as family names names that have\r\nbeen adopted by the writers. Theses and disputations stand under the\r\nnames not of the students but of the instructors. Anonymous works are\r\nalphabeted under their titles.” Against the entries of books which were\r\ncondemned in the Tridentine Index, is noted _Ind. Trid._, and for those\r\ncondemned under Clement, _Append. Ind. Trid._ For the prohibitions\r\nafter 1696, the year is specified, and occasionally the Bull itself.\r\nIn the cases in which the entry includes the place and date of\r\npublication, the prohibition applies not to the work as a whole, but\r\nonly to the particular edition cited; but in the absence of such\r\nspecification, the condemnation applies to the work in all its issues.\r\nThe addition of the term _donec corrigatur_ or _donec expurgetur_\r\nindicates that the responsibility for the corrections rests with the\r\nIndex Congregation. Reusch points out that the lists in this Index,\r\nwhile presenting corrections of many of the errors contained in the\r\nTridentine and Clementine, are themselves by no means either correct\r\nor complete. A number of the names of the Clementine lists have been\r\nomitted simply through the oversight of the transcribers.\r\n\r\nThe _Decreta Generalia_ have the sub-heading: “Prohibited books which\r\nhave been written or published by heretics or which have to do with\r\nheresies or with creeds of unbelievers.” This part of the work contains\r\nthe following subdivisions:\r\n\r\n   1. The prayers and offices of the heretics.\r\n\r\n   2. _Apologia_ in which their errors are defended or favoured.\r\n\r\n   3. Editions of the Scriptures edited or printed by heretics, or\r\n   containing notes, _scholia_, or commentaries prepared by\r\n   unbelieving writers.\r\n\r\n   4. Any portions of the Scriptures put into verse by heretics.\r\n\r\n   5. Heretical editions of calendars, martyrologies, and\r\n   necrologies.\r\n\r\n   6. Poems, narrations, addresses, pictures, or compositions of\r\n   any kind in which heretical beliefs are commended.\r\n\r\n   7. Catechisms, A.B.C. primers, commentaries on the Apostles’\r\n   Creed or the Ten Commandments, instructions in doctrine.\r\n\r\n   8. Colloquies, conferences, disputations, synodical proceedings\r\n   concerning the creeds, edited or printed by heretics.\r\n\r\n   9. Articles of Faith, confessions, or creeds of heretics.\r\n\r\n   10. Dictionaries, vocabularies, glossaries, and thesauri compiled\r\n   or printed by heretics (as examples are specified the works\r\n   of the class bearing the names of the Stephani, Scapula, and\r\n   Hoffman); these books may, however, be permitted when they have\r\n   been purged of heretical passages or of entries that could be\r\n   utilised against the Catholic faith.\r\n\r\n   11. Works presenting or defending the creeds of any of the\r\n   Mohammedan sects.\r\n\r\nCertain of the above specifications of classes are entered in the\r\nalphabeted lists under the headings: _Apologia_, _Catechesis_,\r\n_Colloquium_, _Confessio_, _Disputatio_, etc. The titles of individual\r\nworks belonging to such classes, titles which had found place in many\r\npreceding Indexes, are then omitted. In some instances a specific work\r\nis entered as an example or type of the class to be prohibited, as\r\n_Apologia Confessionis Augustinae_, with the _addendum_, _et caeterae\r\nomnes haereticorum apologiae; vide Decreta_.\r\n\r\nUnder the heading of “Prohibited Books on Special Subjects,” are\r\nclassed together works condemned under certain prohibitions of the\r\nlast half of the 16th century and the first half of the 17th; for\r\ninstance, works on duelling, and letters or pamphlets in which the\r\nso-called laws and rules of duelling are presented. Forbidden also are\r\n_Pasquilles_ (broadsides or tractates), printed or written, which\r\nmake citations from the Scriptures, or which in any fashion “approach\r\ntoo near” to God or to the saints, or to the sacraments or other holy\r\nthings of the Church.\r\n\r\nIn certain letters addressed to the Inquisitor-General of Spain,\r\nBenedict XIV names a number of writers whose works had, on the ground\r\nof special consideration for the authors, been spared from the\r\ninsertion in the Index, although they had fully deserved such measure\r\nof condemnation. Among the books so specified are those of the Pope’s\r\nfriend, Ludovico Antonio Muratori (1672–1750). When this letter of the\r\nPope with reference to Muratori was made public, the latter wrote to\r\nthe Pope for some specification of the grounds for the condemnation\r\nof his writings. The Pope replied that he had had in view in this\r\nreference, not the theological writings of his friend, but the treatise\r\non the civil jurisdiction of the Pope in the papal States. A number of\r\nthe writings of Muratori came into sharp criticism and were the subject\r\nof controversy, but although these were thoroughly investigated and\r\nformally denounced in Rome, no one of them finds place in the Index.\r\n\r\nIn the list of authors is retained the name of Poza for his complete\r\nworks, in continued antagonism to the approval of these works by the\r\nframers of the Spanish Indexes. Another noteworthy entry is that of\r\nthe _Bibliothèque Janséniste, ou Catalogue Alphabétique des Livres\r\nJansénistes, Quesnellistes, Baganistes ou Suspects de ces Erreurs_\r\n(Decr., September 20, 1749). This is the work that supplies the\r\nmaterial for the anti-Jansenist appendix in the latest Spanish Index.\r\nIts condemnation here constitutes a fresh instance of the antagonism\r\nwhich continued in regard to literature and in regard to certain points\r\nof doctrine as presented in literature, between the Church of Rome and\r\nthe Church of Spain.\r\n\r\nRaynaud, whose work had been prohibited in the preceding Index, had\r\nadded his protest to that of Poza at the injustice of being condemned\r\nunheard. In his _Genitus Columbae_, is printed as a parody on the\r\nmethods of the censors, a critique on the Apostles’ Creed in every\r\narticle of which is discovered some latent and insidious heresy. The\r\nwork was itself, naturally enough, promptly condemned.[29]\r\n\r\nThis Index of Benedict represents the beginning of what may be called\r\nthe modern policy of the Catholic Church in regard to the censorship\r\nof literary production and the control or supervision of the reading\r\nof the faithful. By the middle of the 18th century, the Church\r\nauthorities were finally prepared to admit the impracticability, with\r\nany such commissions or examining bodies as could be maintained,\r\nof making an individual examination of each work produced from the\r\nprinting-press. Such a conclusion might with better wisdom have been\r\narrived at a century earlier. The most direct evidence of the futility\r\nof the attempts on the part of the Congregation of the Index, of the\r\nRoman Inquisition, and of the local inquisitors to inform themselves\r\nintelligently concerning the nature, the orthodoxy, and the probable\r\ninfluence for good or for bad of the increasing mass of books brought\r\ninto print from year to year, is presented by the Indexes themselves.\r\nThe work of the compilation of these successive Indexes was placed in\r\nthe hands of scholarly men, and, in the large majority of cases, of men\r\nwhose integrity of purpose and devotion to the higher interests of the\r\nChurch need not be brought into question. These devout and scholarly\r\ncompilers were, however, willing to put into print, under the authority\r\nof an infallible Church, instructions for the reading of believers\r\nwhich the most faithful of Catholics must have found difficulty in\r\nobeying with any consistency.\r\n\r\nThe Index lists are marvels of bibliographical inaccuracy. The names\r\nof the authors, frequently misspelled, are entered almost at random,\r\nat times under their surnames or locality-names, sometimes in the\r\nvernacular, sometimes in the Latin forms. This method, or lack of\r\nmethod, necessarily resulted in duplicate entries, while the copyists,\r\ninstructed to transfer for printer’s copy for a later Index the titles\r\nfrom an earlier, succeeded not infrequently (possibly in the desire\r\nto avoid duplications) in omitting altogether writers and books of\r\nunquestioned heresy. More serious, however, than these bibliographical\r\nblunders, the responsibility for which rested in part at least with\r\ncopyists or with compositors, were the errors which were undoubtedly\r\ndue to editorial ignorance. It was increasingly impossible for the\r\ncompilers to secure personal knowledge of the contents of more than a\r\nvery small proportion of the books which were to be passed upon and\r\nclassed as either safe or pernicious. Descriptions or impressions of\r\ncurrent publications such as are available to-day through reviews were,\r\nprior at least to the middle of the 18th century, non-existent. The\r\njudgment arrived at concerning an unfamiliar book depended in part on\r\nthe name of the author, and in part on that of the printer or the place\r\nof publication. Certain printing offices and certain publishing centres\r\ncame to be associated in the minds of the Roman censors with heretical\r\nopinions. The general policy seems to have been that it was safer to\r\ncondemn a few books not assuredly either pernicious or heretical, than\r\nto run the risk of omitting from the lists any single work which might\r\nconstitute an influence against the authority of the Church.\r\n\r\nThe selections were also largely influenced by the doctrinal issues\r\nand by the party prejudices that arose between the great Orders of\r\nthe Church. The direction of the censorship work in Rome, both of the\r\nInquisition and of the Congregation, has, since their institution,\r\nremained in the hands of the Dominicans. The natural result was a\r\nstrong bias of opinion and of action against the writings of the\r\nJesuits and of the Franciscans. When, as occasionally happened, the\r\ntwo latter Orders secured representation on the boards of examiners,\r\nopportunity was taken to pay off literary scores against the Dominican\r\nwriters. Of these three great bodies in the Church, the Jesuits\r\nincluded by far the larger proportion of scholarly workers and were\r\nresponsible for the larger mass of dogmatic and theological literature.\r\nIt is the books of the Jesuits, therefore, that furnish the largest\r\nnumber of titles to the lists of prohibited doctrinal works by Catholic\r\nwriters.\r\n\r\nUp to the time of Benedict, the authorities who had directed the work\r\nof the compilers had thought it necessary to give consideration to\r\nthe literature produced by Protestant writers, as far as they could\r\nsecure knowledge concerning the character of the books, or could\r\nsecure at least information as to their existence. Such knowledge and\r\ninformation were at best but imperfect and fragmentary. The selections\r\nfrom Protestant writers that appear in the Indexes of Pius IV, Paul IV,\r\nand Clement VIII impress one as curiously haphazard. It is difficult\r\nto understand under what instructions the work of the compilers was\r\ndone. The names of the larger heretics of the Reformation period, such\r\nas Luther, Calvin, Zwingli, Oecolampadius, find place in the greater\r\nnumber of the Indexes, although even with these larger names there are\r\noccasional curious omissions. In no one of these earlier Indexes,\r\nhowever, in which the attempt was made to present a complete list of\r\nthe doctrinal writings of these leaders of the Reformation, have the\r\ncompilers been successful in making a list that was either complete or\r\ncorrect. It is possibly on the ground of some consciousness of probable\r\nomissions that, after having inserted in the alphabeted lists the\r\ntitles (more or less correctly worded) of certain books, it was thought\r\nsafer to make a second entry by the name of the author, followed by the\r\nterm “_Opera omnia_.” With the second and third groups (considered\r\nin the order of their relative importance) of the Protestant doctrinal\r\nwriters, the selection both of the writers themselves and of their\r\nbooks becomes much more incidental or accidental. In certain instances,\r\nthe most important controversial production of such an author is left\r\nuncondemned, while for some comparatively insignificant tract space is\r\nmade in the catalogue.\r\n\r\nWhile the selections from writers other than Catholic are devoted in\r\nthe main to doctrinal and controversial literature, and were probably\r\nmade up as the result of a general instruction to place on the list of\r\nprohibitions all works inimical to the true Faith, the Indexes include\r\nalso a curious sprinkling of titles of what may be called miscellaneous\r\nliterature, that is, of books having nothing to do with matters of\r\ndoctrine, theology, or religion.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to have some consideration given in the Indexes to the\r\nliterature of the whole of Europe, caused the compilers to depend for\r\ntheir titles upon catalogues which, in many cases, they could not have\r\nhad an opportunity of verifying. The Italian editors transcribed for\r\nthese Roman Indexes titles of books which appeared from year to year\r\nin the announcement-lists of the Frankfort Book-Fair. Their opinions\r\nor guesses as to the pernicious character of a book so announced could\r\nbe based only upon the name of the author, if this happened to be a\r\nwell-known name, or upon the imprint and general character of the\r\npublisher whose name indicated of course the place of production. It\r\nwas the case, however, with the publishing catalogues of Frankfort\r\nin the 16th and 17th centuries, as with similar catalogues in later\r\ncenturies, that a certain proportion of the books announced never came\r\ninto print at all. Either no sufficient subscriptions were secured, or\r\nthere was a change in the plans of the publisher, or the author did not\r\nsecure the necessary resources to ensure the undertaking, or the author\r\ndied before the completion of his work. As a result, distinction and\r\ncommemoration were secured in the Index for a number of books which\r\nnever came into existence.\r\n\r\nIn the Index of Benedict, while no specific statement to such effect\r\nis made, the compilers had evidently been instructed to concentrate\r\ntheir censorship labours upon books which, bearing the names of\r\nCatholic writers, and printed, for the most part, within Catholic\r\nterritory, were likely to have influence with readers among the\r\nfaithful. The authorities of the Church had finally recognised, after\r\na series of experiments continuing during two centuries, that it was\r\nnot practicable for a group of Italian priests, working in Rome, to\r\nkeep themselves adequately informed concerning the productions of\r\nthe printing-press throughout the civilised world. It was not only a\r\nphysical impossibility to secure knowledge of the contents of these\r\nbooks, printed no longer in one universal language of literature and\r\nscholarship but in all the languages of civilisation; it was even\r\nimpracticable to obtain and to utilise for Index purposes any fairly\r\ncomplete bibliographies of their titles. From the time of Benedict to\r\nthe present day, the censorship of the Church has therefore restricted\r\nits efforts in the main to the supervision of Catholic literature.\r\nIt is necessary, however, to use the term “in the main” because the\r\nIndex of Benedict and the succeeding Indexes, including even the two\r\npromulgated by Leo XIII, include, in connection with the long lists\r\nof doctrinal works by Catholic writers, a curious sprinkling of books\r\nwritten by Protestants for Protestant communities, the majority of\r\nwhich books have no concern whatsoever with doctrinal matter. It\r\nit very difficult to arrive at any understanding of the policy on\r\nwhich these selections, comprising a few dozen volumes out of many\r\nthousands, have been arrived at. It does not seem to have been based\r\non the relative importance, as hundreds of productions which secured a\r\nworld-wide reputation, and the influence of which has been decidedly\r\nadverse to the contentions of the Church, have received no attention,\r\nwhile volumes of lesser significance have been found worthy of\r\ncondemnation.\r\n\r\nThe lists of the Catholic books have also, under the system pursued by\r\nthe editors of Benedict and their successors, been largely reduced.\r\nThe method pursued by the Benedictine compilers of condemning _in\r\ntoto_ certain classes of literature and all books relating to\r\ncertain specified subjects, saves the editors from the necessity of\r\npresenting long lists of titles. In no other manner, in fact, could the\r\nconclusions of the censors of the 18th and 19th centuries in regard to\r\nthe current productions of the printing-press have been brought within\r\nreasonable compass. The Index of Benedict marks the beginning of the\r\nmodern policy of the Church in the matter of censorship.\r\n\r\nHilgers lays stress on the wise toleration of Benedict, as expressed in\r\nthese regulations of 1758, in insisting that in all cases of doubt, and\r\nparticularly when the book under examination was a work of a Catholic\r\nof repute, the advantage of the doubt should be given to the author;\r\nthat the author should, if within reach, be given an opportunity,\r\nbefore the decision concerning his book was reached, of being heard\r\nbefore the examiners; that the examination of any book the subject of\r\nwhich might not be one for general understanding should be committed\r\nto “consultors” or “qualificators,” one or more of whom must have\r\nexpert knowledge of the subject-matter; that the judgment should be\r\nbased upon, not the view of any one Order or group or school, but upon\r\nthe whole policy of the Christian Church and with reference purely\r\nto the welfare and instruction of believers. Hilgers also commends\r\nthe wise liberality of Benedict in regard to works of science. He\r\nadds: “So valuable for the influence of the people is the example of\r\nmen of science, that it is not too much to say that even in the work\r\nof scientific investigation, it is their duty, irrespective of the\r\nregulations of the Church, to secure a dispensation for the reading of\r\nprohibited books or doubtful books.”[30]\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of Benedict, issued under the title _Sollicita ac\r\nprovida_, was considered to be so wisely framed that Leo XIII, while\r\nrepealing all the earlier regulations, found it desirable to confirm\r\nand to republish this in the Index of 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\n=2. Issues of the Roman Index, 1763–1899.=--The Index of 1758\r\nconstitutes the foundation of all later issues of the Roman Index.\r\nA series of appendices were compiled at irregular intervals (from\r\nfive to ten years) in such form that they could be bound in with the\r\nBenedictine Index. At longer intervals (from twenty-five to fifty\r\nyears), the lists were consolidated into one alphabet and the Index, so\r\nprinted, constituted a legitimate new edition. The responsibility for\r\nthe compilation of these additional lists rested with the successive\r\nsecretaries of the Congregation of the Index. The introduction, written\r\nby the secretary to each new appendix, follows pretty closely the\r\nwording of that of Ricchini, printed in 1758.\r\n\r\nAppendices issued in 1763, 1770, and 1779 were printed in the\r\nprinting-office of the Holy See. A number of the better printed\r\neditions which, according to the title-page, were the work of this\r\noffice, were, as Reusch points out, actually printed in places other\r\nthan Rome. Certain of these have been identified with the typography of\r\noffices in Parma, Venice, and Florence. The Index issued in 1786 was\r\ncontinued with five appendices; and, in 1806, was reprinted with the\r\nsix lists in one alphabet. The first Roman Index of the 19th century\r\nwas issued in 1819, with an introduction from Alex. Aug. Bardani. The\r\nsecond Index of the century was published under Gregory XVI in 1835,\r\nand the third under the same Pope in 1841. Both issues contained\r\nprefaces by Thomas Ant. Degola. These three Indexes were reprinted in a\r\nnumber of impressions, and the practice had now obtained of recording\r\ncorrectly the place of issue. Italian issues, printed with the papal\r\nprivilege, were published at Monza, Monreale (in Sicily), and Naples;\r\nand an edition printed in Mechlin also carries a papal privilege.\r\nEditions for which no such privilege was secured appeared in Paris and\r\nin Brussels. Under Pius IX, were published two editions of the Index,\r\none in 1865 and the second in 1877. Under Leo XIII, were also published\r\ntwo, one in 1881 and the second in 1900 (the preface bears date 1899).\r\nThis latter is at the present date (January, 1907) the latest issue in\r\nthe papal series. It is described in detail in Chapter XI. These two\r\nIndexes contain each an introduction by the same editor, Hieronymus\r\nPius Saccheri. The second Index of Leo represents a higher standard\r\nof bookmaking than had been reached by any previous Index either\r\npapal or Spanish. The lists are remarkably free from bibliographical\r\nor typographical errors and the printed page is not only readable\r\nbut artistic. The previous issues of the 19th century, and those of\r\nthe 18th and 17th, present but very little advance in the matter of\r\nconsistent and uniform bibliography or in freedom from misprints.\r\nAccording to the routine obtaining after the accession of Benedict, all\r\nthe more important of the changes which took shape in the successive\r\nIndexes were decided upon in sessions of the Congregation at which\r\nthe Pope himself presided. Such was the case, for instance, with the\r\nelimination of the general prohibition of the Copernican writings, with\r\nthe cancellation of the series of entries connected with the issues\r\nbetween Paul V and Venice, and with the recall of the prohibition of\r\nthe writings of Cardinal Noailles.\r\n\r\nWhat may be called the editorial division (that is to say, the\r\nintroduction and official entries) in the Index of Benedict is repeated\r\nwithout change in all the later Indexes through the 19th century.\r\nIn the Index of 1835, are added to this division two papers. The\r\nfirst is a _mandatum_ of Leo XII, issued under a decree of the\r\nCongregation of March 26, 1825, which reads in substance as follows:\r\n\r\n   “His Holiness has ordered that all patriarchs, archbishops,\r\n   bishops, and other ecclesiastical dignitaries shall carefully\r\n   bear in mind their responsibilities under the Rules as\r\n   promulgated by the Council of Trent, together with the additions\r\n   to the same which were published by Clement VIII, Alexander\r\n   VIII, and Benedict XIV. It is evidently impossible to bring into\r\n   the Index the titles of all publications appearing from year to\r\n   year which are pernicious in character or dangerous in doctrine.\r\n   It is no longer practicable to apply the authority of the Church\r\n   through prohibitions of specific books or cautions as to these,\r\n   to prevent the faithful from being injured by such pernicious\r\n   literature. The Church authorities must therefore issue general\r\n   instructions based upon the Index Rules, by means of which\r\n   instructions, the faith of believers can be protected against\r\n   heresy and demoralisation.”\r\n\r\nThe second is a _monitum_ of the Congregation of the Index, dated March\r\n4, 1828. The Congregation enjoins upon all patriarchs, archbishops,\r\nbishops, confessors, and local inquisitors the importance of making\r\nthorough application of the provision of the second of the Tridentine\r\nRules: “Works by heretics which have to do with religious or\r\ntheological subjects are prohibited without reservation.” The _monitum_\r\nmakes reference also to the instruction of Clement VIII: “All works\r\nwhich are prohibited by the Holy See in the original text are also\r\nforbidden in all translations of the same.”\r\n\r\nIn the Index of 1841, was included a _monitum_ concerning translations\r\ninto the vernacular of the Scriptures. In the Index of 1877, was\r\nincluded a statement concerning the modification of the penalties that\r\nhad been prescribed under the Bull of 1869, and also a declaration\r\nconcerning books on the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1844, Gregory XVI had included in an encyclical a _monitum_\r\ncautioning all believers to guard themselves not only against the\r\nreading of all books prohibited by title, but against the use or\r\nthe influence of any literature belonging to the classes which are\r\ncondemned and prohibited under the general instructions of the Index.\r\nThis _monitum_ of Gregory’s was, however, not itself reprinted in any\r\nof the succeeding Indexes.\r\n\r\nThe _Decreta Generalia_ have received no additions since the\r\ntime of Benedict. A number of general prohibitions have, however,\r\nbeen issued which are analogous in their character and authority\r\nto the _Decreta_. These are printed in the text of the Index\r\nproper and, in certain cases, under headings where they would hardly\r\nbe looked for. Some of them are entered under _libri_ (_omnes\r\nincredulorum_); the prohibition of books on spiritualism is entered\r\nunder the term “matter.” Some of these general prohibitions, such as\r\nthat of the writings of the Carbonari, escaped being repeated in any of\r\nthe Indexes.\r\n\r\nA formula which finds place in the Index first under Benedict reads:\r\n_Auctor laudabiliter se subjecit et opus suum reprobavit_.\r\n\r\nWhen a work has been condemned by the Inquisition or by the\r\nCongregation on the ground of heretical propositions, the determination\r\nof such propositions is based upon certain general principles laid down\r\nby the Inquisition. The author has the alternative of cancelling the\r\nbook altogether or of agreeing to reprint it with the elimination of\r\nthe propositions condemned as heretical.\r\n\r\nIn later years, it has been the practice of the Congregation in the\r\ncase of authors to whom, on one ground or another, it is thought\r\ndesirable to extend consideration, to give to such authors, in advance\r\nof the publication of any condemnation, the opportunity of making the\r\neliminations or corrections required. If the author promptly assents to\r\nsuch a course, his work is not included in any of the official lists of\r\ncondemnation. Catholics who learn first through the publication of the\r\nofficial reports that their writings have come into condemnation and\r\nwho thereupon make submission and promise of correction, are recorded\r\nin a supplementary decree of the Congregation. Such decree makes\r\nannouncement of the fact of the submission and gives approval to the\r\ntext as corrected, of the work in question. The form of announcement is\r\nas follows: _Auctor laudabiliter se subjecit et opus reprobavit_. In\r\nthe case of works which have been prohibited with a _d.c._ the formula\r\nreads: _Auctor laudabiliter se subjecit et reprobanda reprobavit_ or\r\n_et opus amendavit_. There are various examples of the use of this\r\nformula between the years 1873 and 1881.\r\n\r\nIn a decree of Pius IX, issued in June, 1848, the censorship concerning\r\nmaterial of a religious or doctrinal character, printed either in books\r\nor periodicals, was restricted to the territory of the States of the\r\nChurch. A decree of the inquisitor-general, issued in September, 1851,\r\nstates:\r\n\r\n   “It is become known to us that either on the ground of malice,\r\n   of wilful disobedience, or of ignorance, certain persons fail to\r\n   give information to the Holy See concerning the undertakings of\r\n   heretics and the spread of Protestant contentions, or concerning\r\n   the publication of attacks or satires against the Pope or\r\n   against ecclesiastical Orders, or as to the distribution of\r\n   writings in which the Holy Scriptures have been misused or\r\n   misquoted, or the distribution of works printed without the\r\n   official permit, or the reading, printing or possession of such\r\n   works. It is hereby ordered that all such delinquents shall\r\n   incur the penalty of excommunication _latae sententiae_.\r\n   This edict is to be placed in every sacristy. It is further\r\n   ordered that all printers, booksellers, collectors of customs,\r\n   janitors, landlords, and shopkeepers of any kind shall place\r\n   copies of this edict in their premises in such manner that it\r\n   shall be read by all.”\r\n\r\nIn an instruction given in July, 1878, by the cardinal vicar of Rome,\r\nwhich has to do particularly with the regulation of divine service,\r\nof the sermons, and of the schools of heretics, “whose operations are\r\ncarried on under the very eyes of the Teacher of Infallible Youth,” is\r\nprinted the announcement:\r\n\r\n   “The typesetters who, in order to prevent themselves from losing\r\n   their work, put into type the writings of heretics, come into\r\n   grievous sin. This is essentially the case with those who lend\r\n   themselves to the production of works maintaining or defending\r\n   heretical doctrines for which works the Pope has ordered the\r\n   larger excommunication.”\r\n\r\n_1806.

This address refers, with congratulation, to the pious\r\ninterest of the faithful which had exhausted the edition of the Index\r\nof 1786 (making, curiously enough, no reference to the intervening\r\nIndex of 1806). The volume was reprinted in 1822 with two appendices\r\nand two decrees. The closing portion of the second decree is devoted to\r\na denunciation of five works in English relating to papal controversies\r\nin North America, as follows:\r\n\r\n“An Address to the Congregation of St. Mary’s Church, Philadelphia.”\r\n\r\n“Continuation of an Address,” etc.\r\n\r\n“The Opinion of the Right Reverend John Rico on the Address.”\r\n\r\n“Address of the Committee.”\r\n\r\n“Address of the Right Reverend Bishop of Pennsylvania,” etc.\r\n\r\nA further edition of this Index with some revisions was printed in\r\nParis in 1825--_Le Catalogue des Ouvrages mis à l’Index, contenant\r\nles noms de tous les Livres condamnés par la Cour de Rome, depuis\r\nl’invention de l’Imprimerie jusqu’ à 1825, avec les dates des Décrets\r\nde leur condamnation_. The lists are preceded by an _Avis de l’Éditeur_\r\nin which an account is given of the Congregation of the Index at Rome\r\nwith reference to the work of Catalani. It proceeds to say that the\r\nworks comprehended in this Index are those which had been prohibited by\r\nPius VI and Pius VII, together with all which are known to have been\r\nsince censured _sous l’heureux gouvernment de l’Église Universelle par\r\nN.T.S. Père le Pape Léon XII_. It is not clear what authority this\r\ngeneral Index may have been held to possess in France as, under various\r\npreceding utterances, the Gallican Church had taken the position\r\nthat the Indexes of Rome were not to have authority in France unless\r\nreissued with the specific approval of the rulers of the French Church.\r\n\r\nThis Index contains a condemnation of the “Defence of the Ancient\r\nFaith,” by the Rev. Peter Gandolphy, published in 1816, a work which\r\nhad secured the approbation of the master of the sacred palace and of\r\nDamiani, master of theology. The appendix includes also Lady Morgan’s\r\nvolume on Italy, and a special decree in regard to the New Testament.\r\n\r\nA reprint of the Index of 1819 was issued in Brussels in 1828.\r\n\r\n_1835.

Catalogues of Books Approved.\r\n\r\n\r\n=1. Papal Prohibitions in the 17th and 18th Centuries.=--As in\r\nprevious periods, there are in the 17th century numerous examples\r\nof papal prohibitions, through constitutions, bulls, or briefs, of\r\nindividual books which were held to be sufficiently important to call\r\nfor such special action. In 1602, Clement VIII condemns the works\r\nof Carolus Molinaeus; in 1642, Urban VIII condemns the writings of\r\nJansen together with a number of treatises by the followers of Jansen;\r\nin 1661, Alexander VII condemns a French version of the missal. The\r\nformula generally utilised for these individual prohibitions was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n   “We condemn this work after mature consideration, on our\r\n   personal judgment (_motu proprio_) and with assured knowledge\r\n   (of its pernicious character), on the Apostolic authority\r\n   (vested in us); and we prohibit to all persons, whatever may be\r\n   their rank or position, the printing, reading, or possession\r\n   of the same. The penalty for disobedience shall be the\r\n   _excommunicatio latae sententiae_. We direct that the existing\r\n   copies of said work be delivered to the bishop or to the\r\n   inquisitor of the diocese, by whom such copies shall be promptly\r\n   burned. This order shall be placed on the doors of the Basilica\r\n   of the Church of the Apostles and on the doors of the Apostolic\r\n   Chancellery, and on the gate-way of the Campus Florae, and when\r\n   so published, shall be held to have been delivered in person to\r\n   each individual affected by it.”\r\n\r\nIn the case of a Bull, the wording of the first paragraph was:\r\n\r\n“Through this Constitution, which shall remain in force for ever, and\r\nunder the authority of the blessed Apostles Peter and Paul, and of\r\nourselves.”\r\n\r\nAfter the time of Alexander VII, 1665, the condemnation is made to\r\nfollow the decisions arrived at by theological examiners appointed\r\nfor the purpose, or by the cardinals of the Inquisition. The greater\r\nnumber of the prohibitions continued, however, to emanate from the\r\nCongregation of the Index, while for a few, the responsibility rested\r\nwith the Inquisition.\r\n\r\nIn 1753, Benedict XIV in the Bull _Sollicita_ (printed later\r\nin connection with the Index of 1758) gives consideration to the\r\nregulation of the proceedings of the two bodies. The substance of\r\nBenedict’s ruling is as follows:\r\n\r\n   In the case of a book which is denounced by the Inquisition as\r\n   deserving of condemnation, and the prohibition of which has not\r\n   been confirmed by the Index Congregation, the following measures\r\n   shall be taken. The book shall be examined by a commission\r\n   appointed for the purpose, and the written report of these\r\n   examiners shall be submitted (with the book itself) to the\r\n   cardinals. The conclusion of the cardinals shall be referred\r\n   to the pope, who will give the final judgment in the matter.\r\n   In the case of a book by a Catholic author, the condemnation\r\n   shall not be permitted to rest on the decision of one examiner.\r\n   His adverse report must secure the confirmation of a second\r\n   censor appointed by the Congregation. If the judgments of the\r\n   two differ, the matter must be passed upon by the cardinals.\r\n   The Congregation of the Index is always to include several\r\n   cardinals. The _Magister_ of the papal palace is a member\r\n   _ex officio_. The secretary shall be a Dominican selected by\r\n   the pope. The Congregation has the assistance of a number of\r\n   counsellors selected from the clergy and from the Orders and\r\n   from the judicial class (_Relatores_). The sessions of the\r\n   Congregation are not regular, as are those of the Inquisition,\r\n   but are called in response to the report of the secretary\r\n   that there is business requiring action. This leaves to the\r\n   secretary a large discretion in the initiating of action and\r\n   in the selection of matters to be passed upon. In the case of\r\n   a book by a Catholic author of good repute (_integrae famae_)\r\n   in which pernicious material is found, the prohibition shall,\r\n   if practicable, be made not general, but conditional, under\r\n   the heading of _donec corrigatur_ or _donec expurgetur_. The\r\n   decree shall not be made public at once, but opportunity shall\r\n   be given to the author or to some representative of the author\r\n   to make the required corrections. If the author shall agree\r\n   to withdraw from sale the original edition, replacing this\r\n   with the corrected text, no public prohibition need be made.\r\n   If the original edition has come into general circulation,\r\n   the condemnation shall be so worded as to apply only to such\r\n   uncorrected text. The loss incurred through such cancellation\r\n   and reprinting appears to have fallen upon the publisher unless\r\n   the edition were the property of the author, or the publishing\r\n   agreement made the author responsible for losses incurred on the\r\n   ground of heresies. In reply to the complaint that books had\r\n   from time to time been prohibited without an opportunity being\r\n   given to the author to defend his production against the charge\r\n   of heresy, the Bull takes the ground that the purpose of the\r\n   action of the Church is not to pronounce judgment on authors,\r\n   but to protect the faithful against injury through heretical\r\n   doctrine. Any detriment caused to the repute of the author is\r\n   an incidental result which cannot be avoided. In any case, the\r\n   judgment on the character of the production is to be arrived at\r\n   with due deliberation and full knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe Pope expresses his intention to be present at sessions of the\r\nCongregation when matters of first importance are to be considered.\r\nDecisions concerning the works of unquestioned heretics, in regard to\r\nbooks containing direct attacks on the doctrines of the Church, can,\r\nhowever, be disposed of without his counsel and under the Rules of the\r\nIndex of Trent. The members of the Congregation bind themselves to\r\nsecrecy as to its proceedings. The secretary is, however, at liberty to\r\ngive information to the author or the publisher of the book condemned.\r\n\r\n   “The counsellors and examiners of the Congregation are cautioned\r\n   to proceed with their work with due conservatism. They are by\r\n   no means to assume that a work submitted is certainly to be\r\n   condemned but are to assure themselves by diligent investigation\r\n   whether it may not be possible to declare it fitting for\r\n   circulation, either in its original form or with certain\r\n   omissions or emendations. Care is to be taken to place each book\r\n   in the hands of examiners having expert and scholarly knowledge\r\n   of the subject-matter. The examiners must free themselves from\r\n   prejudices of race, native school of thought, or ecclesiastical\r\n   order. They must keep before them that the essential purpose of\r\n   their work is the defence of the faith, and the preservation\r\n   of the doctrines of the Church as set forth by the decrees of\r\n   the general councils, the constitutions of the popes, and by\r\n   the teachings of the Fathers and of their learned successors,\r\n   and the maintenance of the authority of the Church universal.\r\n   The examiners must bear in mind that it is not possible to\r\n   judge fairly of the character of a book without reading the\r\n   entire text, and that the statements in the different divisions\r\n   of the work must be carefully collated one with another. It\r\n   is frequently the case that a sentence taken apart from its\r\n   context may give a wrong impression of the author’s meaning, or\r\n   that a sentence which taken alone may seem of doubtful purport,\r\n   will have the thought made clear by comparison with other\r\n   portions of the text. (Conservative counsel which was by no\r\n   means always followed by the censors.) In the case of the work\r\n   of a Catholic author whose orthodoxy is of good repute, it is\r\n   proper, if a sentence or statement may be open to more than one\r\n   interpretation, to give to it the most favourable (_i.e._\r\n   the most orthodox). There are books which, while quite sound\r\n   and orthodox in their purpose and teachings, contain references\r\n   to pernicious writings, or extracts from such writings. The\r\n   knowledge of the heresies thus referred to may do injury to the\r\n   faith of innocent readers. Such books call, therefore, for very\r\n   careful consideration, and if the quoted material is sufficient\r\n   in amount and in character to exert a pernicious influence,\r\n   the work must be expurgated or placed upon the Index. Authors\r\n   are cautioned against the wrongdoing of abusing each other\r\n   whatever may be the difference of opinion, or of using harsh and\r\n   condemnatory language against other writers whose works have not\r\n   been condemned by the Church. These instructions and counsels\r\n   are to be accepted as carrying the full Apostolic authority and\r\n   as binding upon the Congregations, the examiners, and all others\r\n   concerned.”\r\n\r\nCertain of the other Congregations, such as those on confession, on\r\nthe rites of the Church, and on propaganda, assumed the right to\r\nprohibit books having to do with their particular subjects, but their\r\nprohibitions had to be confirmed by, and promulgated through, the\r\nCongregation of the Index.\r\n\r\nThe _Magister_ of the palace had authority to issue in his own name\r\nprohibitions which were valid for the city of Rome. The individual\r\nedicts published by him in the name of the pope were of course\r\ngeneral in their effect. From the time of Clement XI, 1700–1721, the\r\nprohibitions of individual works through bulls and briefs became much\r\nmore frequent. After Benedict XIV, 1756, such prohibitions are to\r\nbe found in allocations and in encyclicals. In 1664, Alexander VII\r\nordered that the injunctions and penalties of Pius IV, as specified\r\nin the Index of Trent, should remain in force, but that all the other\r\nconstitutions and decrees in regard to books, excepting only the _Bulla\r\nCoenae_, be revoked.\r\n\r\nIn the introduction to the Index of 1758, Benedict XIV presents certain\r\nprinciples as controlling, from that time, the work of the censors.\r\nBooks by heretics are to receive consideration only in the instances\r\nin which they treat of the Catholic faith, or teach heresies. The task\r\nof examining and supervising the entire literature of the world was at\r\nlast recognised as one beyond the powers of the Church authorities.\r\n\r\nIn 1869, a Bull of Pius IX restricts the penalty of the excommunication\r\n_latae sententiae_ to the reading, possession, etc., of books written\r\nby heretics, only when these not only contain heresies, but make\r\na formal defence of the same, or when they have been specifically\r\nprohibited by title.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a writer who had already been condemned for uttering\r\nheretical opinions, his later books were likely to be placed on the\r\nIndex irrespective of the character of their contents. In 1615, for\r\ninstance, the opinions of Copernicus were condemned by the Inquisition,\r\nand, a year later, his astronomical treatises were duly prohibited.\r\n\r\nThe condemnation of a book by the Inquisition carried as a rule more\r\nweight than a prohibition by the Congregation. On the other hand, the\r\nInquisition found difficulty in keeping up with its work.\r\n\r\nIn 1711, the Jesuit Daubenton writes to Fénelon: “The Inquisition\r\nhas such a mass of business on its hands, and has available for its\r\nconsideration so few men who are capable and who are ready to give\r\nattention to it, that a period of years may be required to secure the\r\ncondemnation of a book, particularly if it is of considerable compass.”\r\nThe control of the Inquisition, as of the Congregation, rested with\r\nthe Dominicans. The commissary of the former and the secretary of the\r\nlatter, always Dominicans, retained in their hands the continuity and\r\nthe general direction of the business of their respective bodies.\r\n\r\nIn 1633, Lucas Holstenius (a “consultor” appointed by Alexander XII)\r\nwrites from Rome to Peiresc:\r\n\r\n   “We have here a few learned men who would be glad to be of\r\n   service to scholarly literature if there were any possibility of\r\n   securing for their views any recognition.... But the opinions\r\n   of scholars have no weight with these ignorant censors.... One\r\n   of the cardinals who thinks of himself as an intelligent man\r\n   and who has a large control of the business, says openly that\r\n   he is in favour of condemning and burning practically all works\r\n   of a humanistic character (_qui de literis humanioribus et de\r\n   liberali eruditione agunt_) and of leaving in existence only\r\n   the theological treatises, and the writings of a few jurists....\r\n   You will have heard of the recent condemnation of the scholarly\r\n   works of Scaliger, Heinsius, Rivius, and Godenius.... My\r\n   indignation grows and I find myself unwilling to attend any\r\n   more sittings of the Congregation.... I speak thus, for your\r\n   ear only, as here, it is perilous to make any complaint or\r\n   opposition to such proceedings.”[31]\r\n\r\nIn 1686, the learned Benedictine Mabillon, being in Rome, was asked by\r\nthe Congregation to give a report on the writings of Vossius, and later\r\nhe was appointed a “consultor.”\r\n\r\nIn the compilation of the Roman Indexes of the 16th century, the\r\nannouncement catalogues of the Frankfort Fair were largely utilised. As\r\nbefore pointed out, one result of this practice was to bring into the\r\nIndex lists the titles of not a few books of but trifling importance\r\n(which otherwise would have been entirely lost sight of), of others\r\nwhich contained no doctrinal material and in fact nothing pernicious\r\nor objectionable, and of still others which, while announced as in\r\npreparation or in plan, never came into print at all. After 1600, the\r\nFair catalogues appear to have been but little used, but information\r\nconcerning published books was secured from the _Acta Eruditorum_,\r\nthe _Journal des Savants_, and similar periodicals. Bourgeois is\r\nauthority for the statement that after 1650, it was the routine, with\r\nboth Inquisition and Congregation, to take up for consideration only\r\nsuch books as had been specifically denounced.\r\n\r\nIn 1690, Cardinal Ciampini proposed the establishment of a seminar\r\nor commission of ten or twelve scholars, selected from different\r\ncountries, who should be charged with the task of examining the books\r\nissued from the different publishing centres and of making reports\r\nupon which could be based the selections of the Congregation of the\r\nIndex. He proposed to bequeath to such a seminar his library and a\r\ncapital sufficient to secure for each member an annual payment of one\r\nhundred scudi. The foundation never, however, came into existence.\r\nAt the time of Benedict XIV, Cardinal Querini submitted a plea for\r\nthe better organisation of the Congregation and offered an endowment\r\nto be utilised for the printing of the censorship opinions, but the\r\noffer appears not to have been taken advantage of. In 1622, Gregory XV\r\ninstituted the _Congregatio de Propaganda Fide_, and to this body\r\nwas confided the task of examining, and when necessary of prohibiting,\r\nbooks in oriental and other “exotic” tongues. In 1674, Clement X issued\r\na brief prohibiting the printing, “even by Jesuits or other Orders,”\r\nof any works relating to the missions except with the authority of\r\nthe Congregation. The penalty was cancellation of the edition and\r\nexcommunication of those responsible for its production.\r\n\r\nAfter 1610, the edicts of the _Magister_ prohibiting individual\r\nbooks are infrequent. In 1690, we have an example of such an edict\r\nin the case of a treatise on the Immaculate Conception by the Jesuit\r\nSaliceti, which was printed in Rome with the censored passages duly\r\ncancelled in the text. It continued, however, to be the practice for\r\neach _Magister_, in taking office, to issue a general edict\r\nsetting forth the regulations controlling the production of books. One\r\nof the most important of these required the comparison page by page, by\r\nexaminers appointed by the censor, of the text of the book as printed\r\nwith that of the manuscript which had been approved (and possibly\r\ncorrected). Until this comparison had been made, no copies of the\r\nedition could be offered for sale.\r\n\r\nCertain general prohibitions are included in the Clementine Index. In\r\nthe earlier years of the 17th century, further similar prohibitions or\r\ndecrees are published. In 1621, for instance, is printed the series\r\nof decisions of the Congregation of the Council of Trent. The Pope\r\nhad prohibited the publication of any unauthorised translations\r\nof the decrees of Trent, but the above work, carrying with it no\r\nauthorisation, does not find place in the Index lists. In 1601, appears\r\na prohibition of all litanies with the exception of the Laurentian\r\nand that bearing the name of All Saints. In 1603, appears a general\r\nprohibition of all writings concerning the Mohammedan religion. In\r\n1633, a decree of the _Magister S. Palatii_ prohibits all _Elogia\r\nHaereticorum_. With this prohibition, is included a condemnation of\r\nall pictures or medals in honour of heretics. This general prohibition\r\nwas interpreted to bring into condemnation a long series of important\r\nbibliographical works in which had been printed, either with approval\r\nor without condemnation, the names of heretical writers. In April,\r\n1621, an announcement was made, on the part of the Congregation of\r\nthe Council of Trent, protesting against the publication, nominally\r\nunder the authority of the council, of so-called collections of the\r\ndeclarations of the council, and pointing out that such publications\r\nhad been specifically condemned under the Bull of Pius IV. With the\r\nauthority of Gregory XV, all such collections or reports of the\r\ndecisions and conclusions of the council, issued without specific\r\nauthority of the council, which had thus far been printed or which\r\nshould later come into print, were condemned and prohibited. Among\r\nthe works included under this condemnation, were a number which had\r\nbeen prepared by orthodox Catholic theologians and canonists, such as\r\nProsper Farinaccius, Vincenzio de Marzilla, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the 17th century, the Congregation of Rites condemned\r\na series of prayers and litanies. Reusch states that “up to the present\r\nday” (he is writing in 1884) only one such litany, that described as\r\n“In the name of Jesus” had secured approbation. The general decree\r\nof 1601 prohibiting litanies has never been recalled; and under this\r\ndecree stand condemned and prohibited all books of service which\r\ncontain other than the two, or at this time, the three brief litanies.\r\nThis decree, would, according to Reusch, prohibit nine tenths of the\r\nservice books in use in the Catholic Church.\r\n\r\nThe prohibition issued by Alexander in decree number IV with the\r\ntitle: _Instructionum et rituum sectae Mahumetanae libri omnes_,\r\nseems to have had for its immediate text a work entitled: _Liber\r\nde Russorum, Moscovitarum, et Tartarorum religione_, which was\r\nprinted at Spires. In the Index of Benedict, the title was for the\r\nfirst time given complete with the name of the author, Lasitzki, Jo.,\r\n_de Russorum rel. sacrificiis, nuptiarum et funerum ritu e diversis\r\nscriptoribus_. Under the general prohibition of bibliographical\r\nworks in which any terms of approval are connected with the names of\r\nheretical writers, is included (in 1687) the following English work:\r\nCrowaei Guil, _Elenchus scriptorum in s. scripturam tam graecorum\r\nquam latinorum_, London, 1672. A work of similar character,\r\ncompiled by Thomas Pope Blount, under the title _Censura celebrium\r\nauctorum_, printed in London in 1690, escaped the attention of the\r\ncompilers.\r\n\r\n\r\n=2. Book Prohibitions by the Bishops.=--During the 17th and\r\n18th centuries, were published no lists of books condemned under the\r\nauthority of the bishops which compare in importance or in influence\r\nwith the Indexes issued during the 17th century from Louvain and\r\nfrom Paris. During the 17th century, however, there are a number\r\nof instances of individual books condemned by the divines of the\r\nSorbonne, of Louvain, and of other theological faculties. One Index\r\nof some comprehensiveness was issued by the Archbishop of Paris, but\r\nthe work was undertaken at the instance of the Parliament. Two Indexes\r\nwere issued by the Archbishops of Prague, and the decree of Precipiano,\r\nArchbishop of Utrecht, has already been referred to. As late as the\r\nlast half of the 18th century, the bishops have utilised the form of\r\npastoral letters and pastoral instructions for the condemnation of\r\nindividual books and, occasionally, of lists of books. A pastoral\r\nletter, for instance, of the Vicar-General of Augsburg, issued in 1758,\r\npresents a list of fifty-five works which are condemned on the ground\r\nof their association with the “new sects and new teachings of mystics\r\nand fanatics.” In 1752, similar lists were connected with a decree of\r\nthe Bishop of Turenne and a pastoral instruction of the Bishop of Luçon.\r\n\r\nClement XIII (1758–1769) condemned, in briefs issued in January and\r\nin September, 1759, the treatise by Helvetius, _De l’Esprit_, and the\r\nencyclopaedia compiled by the same author, both of which had been\r\npublished anonymously. For the encyclopaedia, the specification was\r\nadded that it belonged to the class of books permission for the reading\r\nof which could be given only by the pope himself. In a brief addressed\r\nin November, 1765, to the Archbishop of Rheims, Clement praises the\r\nassembly of the clergy for the condemnation of pernicious writings,\r\nand in an encyclical issued in November, 1766, he reminds the bishops\r\nof their responsibility for the repression of irreligious works, and\r\nreminds them further that they are to secure in this work the aid of\r\nthe State authorities.\r\n\r\nIn an encyclical issued in 1769, Clement XIV repeats to the bishops\r\nthe injunction of his predecessor in regard to the essential importance\r\nof maintaining the fight for the stamping out of wicked books. In the\r\ndecade succeeding 1758, the Inquisition and the Congregation of the\r\nIndex condemn and prohibit the works of Voltaire, Rousseau, La Mettrie,\r\nd’Holbach, Marmontel, Raynal, and others. The list includes also a\r\ntreatise by Helvetius, in addition to his work _De l’Esprit_,\r\nand single monographs of Diderot and d’Alembert in addition to their\r\ncontributions to the Encyclopaedia.\r\n\r\nIn 1864, the Congregation of the Index issues, under the authority of\r\nPius IX, a circular letter to the bishops authorising and instructing\r\nthem to carry out the prohibitions of the Congregation. Reference is\r\nmade to the Edict of Leo XII, of 1825, and emphasis is laid on the\r\nimportance of checking the irreligious influence of the newspapers.\r\n\r\n\r\n=3. Publication of the Book Prohibitions.=--During the earlier\r\nyears of the 17th century, the lists of the books condemned by the\r\nCongregation or the Inquisition were published by the _Magister_.\r\nAfter 1613, the lists passed upon by the Congregation were prepared for\r\nthe press by the secretary, printed in the papal printing-office, and\r\ndistributed through the local inquisitors and the nuncios. This was\r\nthe course taken, for instance, with the condemnation, in 1616, of the\r\nbooks of Copernicus, and in 1633, with the writings of Galileo. Later,\r\nthe practice obtained of printing the special lists on the annual\r\nlists in the _format_ of the latest edition of the Index, so that\r\nthey could be bound in with this. After 1624, the secretaries of the\r\nCongregation brought into print a number of collections of the various\r\ndecrees.\r\n\r\nIn the reprint, in 1667, of the Index issued by Alexander VII in 1664,\r\nare included no less than ninety-two of the separate decrees. Of the\r\nlater decrees there is no official or complete collection. According\r\nto the contention of the Curia, the publication of a decree in Rome\r\nrendered it binding on Catholics throughout the world, but this view\r\nwas by no means generally accepted. In Spain as in France, it was held\r\nthat the papal bulls and decrees were in force only after they had\r\nbeen formally confirmed and published under national authority, but\r\nin Spain this authority was delegated to the Inquisition. Francis I\r\nrefused altogether to recognise the decrees of the Congregation or of\r\nthe Roman Inquisition. In Venice, Naples, and Belgium, these decrees\r\nbecame authoritative only when confirmed by the State authorities. The\r\ncirculation outside of Italy of copies of the Roman Indexes was very\r\ntrifling, and (with the exception of that of Trent) the reprinting of\r\nthese occurred but seldom. If the work of the papal printing-office\r\nis to be judged by the Roman Indexes and decrees of the 16th and 17th\r\ncenturies, the standard was by no means high. The bibliographical lists\r\nabound in errors, the responsibility for which must be divided between\r\nthe compilers and the typesetters. In not a few instances, the names\r\nand titles have been so seriously twisted that it is often not easy to\r\nidentify the work condemned. The Index of Benedict XIV was the first of\r\nthe Roman series in which any serious attempt appears to have been made\r\nto secure any measure of bibliographical accuracy.\r\n\r\nAn _Abrégé du Recueil des Actes du Clergé_, first issued in 1762,\r\ndivides the bulls and briefs of the popes into two classes: those\r\nwhich have been confirmed and accepted in France; and those which\r\nhave been rejected and which are, therefore, not binding on the\r\nFrench Church.[32] The chronicler explains that it is the general\r\nrule to accept the Roman rescripts which may prove useful for Church\r\nor for State, even although it is often necessary to repudiate\r\ncertain formulas and expressions contained in them. In certain cases,\r\nhowever, the formulas are so repugnant that they cause the rejection\r\nof the Bull itself, as for instance when the king is threatened with\r\nexcommunication or deposition. The French authorities, ecclesiastical\r\nas well as political, refused from the outset to accept the Roman\r\nformula that publication of a decree in Rome made it binding throughout\r\nthe realms of the Church, and they refused also to accept the authority\r\nof any general penalty of excommunication which might be made to\r\ninclude the head of the State.[33]\r\n\r\nThe Advocate-General Omer Talon, in an address delivered in 1647\r\nbefore the Parliament of Paris, says: “We are prepared to recognise\r\nand to accept the authority of the pope but neither the authority nor\r\nthe jurisdiction of the Congregation or of the Curia.” The Chancellor\r\nd’Aguesseau writes in 1710: “It is well understood that the Roman Index\r\ncarries no authority in France where, while the primacy of the pope\r\nis accepted, the authority of the Congregation of cardinals is not in\r\nforce.”[34]\r\n\r\nBossuet writes in regard to such a papal brief:[35] “We hold that these\r\nconstitutions are not binding in a French diocese until (and unless)\r\nthey have been published by the bishop.” Fénelon says: “We are not\r\nwilling through the acceptance of a papal brief to acknowledge the\r\nauthority (for France) of either the Index or Inquisition.”\r\n\r\nAs before stated, within the dominions of Spain, the Spanish Indexes\r\nalone were accepted as authoritative, and the Spanish authorities\r\nvery frequently refused to condemn books that had been prohibited\r\nby the editors of Rome. In other of the States classed as Catholic,\r\nthe authority of the Roman censorship was in like manner contested.\r\nIn 1759, Charles Alexander, Stadtholder of Lorraine, prohibited the\r\nprinting or sale of certain theological treatises by Dens, on the\r\nground that these asserted the authority of the _Bulla Coenae_,\r\nand of the Roman censorship and the immunity of the bishops, and that\r\nthis constituted an assault on the authority of the emperor and on the\r\ngeneral policy of the Netherlands.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Later Heresiarchs.]\r\n\r\n=4. The Continuation of Class I, 1603–1876.=--The list of heretical\r\nauthors of the first class, all of whose works (past and future) were\r\ncondemned, were, in the first group of Roman Indexes, printed without\r\nchange or additions. The authorities do not appear to have considered\r\nthe later heretical writers to be entitled to the dignity of being\r\nclassed as heresiarchs. In the Decree of 1603, the name of Frac.\r\nGuicciardini and that of Peter Frider are added by the Roman editors\r\nto Class I; but these constitute the only additions for the series\r\nof years given. On the other hand, new Spanish Indexes of this class\r\nreceive from decade to decade continued additions.\r\n\r\nAmong the authors, all of whose writings were prohibited in Indexes\r\nprinted prior to Alexander VII (1664), may be noted Hugo Broughton\r\n(of Oxford), Thomas White (of London), Ludwig de Dieu, Gregorius\r\nRichter, Giordano Bruno, Claudius Salmasius, J. B. Poza. Between 1664\r\nand 1756, the list includes among the more noteworthy names, the\r\nGerman writers J. H. Buddaeus, Georg. Calixtus, J. H. Heidigger; the\r\nHollanders Jo. Clericus, Simon Episcopius, Jac. Laurentius, and Lambert\r\nVelthuysen; the Frenchmen J. Daillé, Ch. Drelincourt, Jean d’Espagne;\r\nthe Englishmen G. Bull (Bishop of St. Davids), W. Cave, J. Lightfoot,\r\nHenricus Morus, J. Prideaux, and Thomas Hobbes.\r\n\r\nTo these may be added the names of Molinos van Espen and Colbert,\r\nBishop of Montpellier. It is difficult, in an examination of the\r\ncomplete lists, to arrive at any principle or basis on which the\r\ncompilers made their selections. Of forty-one Protestant writers\r\nwhose names were placed on the Index during one sitting of the Index\r\nCongregation in May, 1757, sixteen were Germans, ten, Hollanders,\r\neleven, Frenchmen, and four, Englishmen. At the same session, were\r\nprohibited the entire series of the theological writings of Hugo\r\nGrotius. Between 1757 and 1821, there is no instance in the Roman\r\nIndexes of the use in connection with the name of an author of the term\r\n_Opera omnia_, although as a fact in a number of cases every book\r\nproduced by some particular author was included under its own title.\r\nBetween the years 1821 and 1827, the authors whose complete works were\r\nthus specifically condemned by title include G. Mordai, David Hume, and\r\nColin de Plancy. In 1852, were added, among other names, those of V.\r\nGiorberti, Proudhon, and Sue. In 1862, the prohibition included Dumas\r\nfather and son, Georges Sand, Murger, Stendhal, Balzac, Champfleury,\r\nFeydeau, and Soulié. In 1876, three names are to be noted, Vera,\r\nSpavente, and Ferrari. The works of John Locke called for special\r\nattention in two of the Indexes of the first half of the 18th century.\r\nThe reading or possession of these books is forbidden under penalty of\r\nexcommunication, _sub anathemate_.\r\n\r\nIn 1610, was prohibited the treatise that had been published in the\r\nprevious year by Hugo Grotius, _Mare liberum S. de jure quod Batavis\r\ncompetit ad Indicana commercia_. The entry was alphabeted under\r\n_H_. The title has been preserved in the later Indexes of the\r\n19th century under the proper heading, Grotius. The purpose of the\r\ntreatise was to contest, on the ground of natural right and of the\r\n_Jus gentium_, the monopoly, which had secured the support of\r\nAlexander VI, of the Spaniards and Portuguese over certain lines of sea\r\ntrade. The Pope had taken the ground that his authority was sufficient\r\nto institute trade monopolies either by land or by sea. If the Pope\r\nwere in a position to grant ownership of territories and of peoples,\r\nthe smaller matter of the connecting trade might naturally be assumed\r\nas the conclusion. Grotius, however, asserts that no authority vested\r\nin the Pope had given to the Spaniards the control of the Indies (of\r\nthe West) and that such control as had come to the Spaniards had been\r\nsecured through force of arms and not through the papal diploma.\r\n\r\n\r\n=5. Catalogues of Books Approved.=--There is ground for surprise\r\nthat while in the four and a half centuries since the publication of\r\nthe first papal Index, the Church has promulgated such a long series\r\nof lists of books condemned and prohibited, the authorities have\r\nnot been interested in giving a larger measure of attention to the\r\nselection of books which could safely be recommended for the reading\r\nof the faithful, and which to some extent at least might be suggested\r\nas taking the place of the literature that was to be cancelled as\r\npernicious. I can find record of but four or five lists, issued under\r\nthe authority of the Church, of books recommended for the reading\r\nof the faithful, and no one of these recommendation catalogues was\r\nprepared in Rome or was published under direct authority from Rome.\r\nThe first Index in the Church series, that published in Louvain in\r\n1546, contains a short list of books recommended. This list is referred\r\nto in the description of the Index itself (see Volume I); a similar\r\nrecommendation list, including in part the same titles, is connected\r\nwith the second Louvain Index of 1550. In 1549, a provincial synod\r\nwas held in Cologne under the direction of the Archbishop Adolf of\r\nSchauenburg. A decree was issued by this synod addressed to “the\r\nsimple and unlearned priests who might not be qualified to distinguish\r\nthe sound from the unsound doctrine, and who had therefore from time\r\nto time been misled by books that were placed in the market with\r\nmisleading titles.” These pastors and their followers were particularly\r\ncharged against any books, whatsoever might be their titles, which\r\ncontain writings of Luther, Calvin, Melanchthon, Oecolampadius, or of\r\ntheir followers. The decree of the synod was connected with a brief\r\nlist of the heretical authors whose works were particularly to be\r\nguarded against, and the statement was made that this would be followed\r\nby a general and comprehensive catalogue or Index. No such general\r\nIndex was, however, prepared. In 1550, however, the diocesan synod\r\nissued a list of books recommended for the use of the instructors and\r\nteachers in the Church schools.\r\n\r\nThe third recommendation list of which I find record was issued in\r\nMunich in 1566, under an edict of Albert V. This is a comprehensive\r\ncatalogue of books which have secured privilege for publication\r\nthroughout the duchy, and which, having been selected under the direct\r\nsupervision of the Church authorities, can be safely recommended for\r\nthe use of students and readers.\r\n\r\nThe heads of convents and Church libraries are cautioned to cleanse\r\ntheir collections from the books which have been condemned under the\r\nprevious prohibitory Index, and to replace these books with the works\r\nnow recommended by the authority of the Church. In the second issue\r\nof this recommendation catalogue are presented, curiously enough, the\r\ntitles of certain works which had been prohibited in the Index of\r\nTrent. Examples of these are the writings of Bohemus, J. P., of Geiler\r\nKaisersperg, Conrad Klingius, Jo. Ferus, F. Guicciardinus.[36] Between\r\nthe years 1606 and 1619, there came into annual publication in Mayence,\r\nas a result apparently of the recommendation of Peter Canisius, the\r\nenergetic head of the Jesuits in Germany, a catalogue, prepared more\r\nparticularly for the use of booksellers in Catholic countries, of books\r\nrecommended for the reading of the faithful. This annual catalogue bore\r\nthe following titles: _Index novus librorum imprimis Catholicorum,\r\ntheologorum, aliorumque celebrium auctorum quarumcunque facultatum\r\net linguarum, causas religionis tamen non tractantium ... pro Italia\r\nceterisque nationibus confectus_. On the back of the title-page\r\nof the issue for 1606, is presented a preface bearing the signature\r\nValentinus Leuchtius. _S. Sedis Apost. librorum revisor, imp.\r\nRodolphi II_, etc. In this preface, the reviser undertakes to lay\r\ndown the principle for the elimination of pernicious literature and\r\nfor the selection of books of wholesome doctrine and sound influence.\r\n\r\nThe above series describes the few fragmentary efforts made in any\r\nformal fashion by the Church authorities during the centuries of\r\ncensorship to guide with any positive advice the reading of the\r\nfaithful. The dependence for counsel in regard to the books to be read\r\nseems to have been left to the individual action of the confessors or\r\nother ecclesiastical advisers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                    ISSUES BETWEEN CHURCH AND STATE\r\n\r\n                               1559–1870\r\n\r\n    1.

Venice and the Papacy, 1606–1696.=--The contest that arose between\r\nPaul V and the Venetian Republic caused to the Pope a larger measure\r\nof trouble than had arisen in connection with the controversy _De\r\nAuxiliis_. The Venetian Senate, in laws enacted in 1603 and 1605,\r\nhad brought under its direct control the building of new churches,\r\nmonasteries, and hospitals; it had prohibited the transfer, either\r\nby sale or by gift, of real estate to any ecclesiastical bodies, and\r\nit had brought for trial before the civil court two ecclesiastics\r\nwho were charged with common crimes. In December, 1605, Paul writes\r\na brief to the Doge and a second brief to the Senate in which he\r\ndeclares these laws to be annulled and demands the delivery to the\r\npapal nuncio of the two clerical delinquents. The Venetians refused\r\nobedience to the demand in the briefs; thereupon the Pope transmits to\r\nthe ecclesiastical bodies of Venice in April, 1606, a _monitorium_\r\nin which he places under excommunication the Doge and the members\r\nof the Senate unless, within twenty-four days after the publication\r\nof this _monitorium_, the demand of the brief be complied with. The\r\nDoge, Leonardo Donato, prohibits the publication of the papal decree.\r\nThe Jesuits, the Capucins, and the Theatins, the only bodies who were\r\naffected by the interdict placed upon the territory of the Republic,\r\nwere expelled. The Pope now threatened the Venetians with war, but in\r\nthe course of a few months, through the intervention of the French\r\nAmbassador and of Cardinal Joyeuse, the two priests were delivered to\r\nthe French Ambassador, with the declaration that the Republic reserved\r\nfor itself the right to punish ecclesiastics for civil offences. The\r\nlaws in regard to such procedure were not recalled, but the Senate\r\nagreed to have the same administered with due reserve. The Senate also\r\nrecalled its manifesto against censorship. The Cardinal, in the name\r\nof the Pope, thereupon recalled the several decrees issued against\r\nthe Republic. The Venetians refused, however, to take back the order\r\nexpelling the Jesuits, and it was not until fifty years later, in 1657,\r\nthat the latter again found place for themselves within the Republic.\r\n\r\nIn 1606, were included in the Index a number of controversial treatises\r\nwhich had been written for the defence of the contentions of the\r\nRepublic or which concerned themselves with the interdict issued by\r\nthe Inquisition. During the time of Alexander VII, was placed upon\r\nthe Index a general prohibition of the record of the interdict issued\r\nby Paul V against the Venetian Republic. This entry was cancelled by\r\nBenedict XIV. During this contest, were placed upon the Index certain\r\ntreatises by Suarez and by Sanchez, both leaders among the Jesuits, on\r\nthe ground that editions of their works, printed by Venetian printers,\r\nhad omitted passages which sustained the authority of the Holy See.\r\nThe printers had been able to secure from the Senate a privilege for\r\nthe printing of these volumes only on condition of the elimination of\r\nthese passages. The most famous of the representatives of Venice in\r\nthis contest was Paolo Sarpi (1552–1626). Sarpi was, in 1626, ordered\r\nby the Inquisition to report to Rome, but he refused obedience and made\r\na formal protest against the order. Sarpi’s _History of the Council\r\nof Trent_ was prohibited promptly after its publication in 1619,\r\nand later, several other writings of his found their way also into\r\nthe Index lists. There is, however, no condemnation under the name of\r\nSarpi of his _Opera omnia_. In 1656, was published the official\r\n_History of the Council of Trent_, compiled by Pallavicini. The\r\nIndex contains the titles of a number of writings which were written in\r\ncriticism of this history.\r\n\r\nIn the _Discorso_ concerning the Inquisition in Venice (printed in\r\n1639), Sarpi (in a reference to certain decrees issued in 1609 and 1610\r\nby Yotella, master of the palace) complains of the attempt on the part\r\nof the papacy to undermine and violate the Concordat made in the year\r\n1596, between the Republic and the pope, which among other obligations\r\nstipulated that no other Index than that of Clement VIII should be\r\nenforced or allowed. In contravention of this stipulation, new decrees\r\nwere year after year being imposed, “chiefly through confessors, which\r\nwere to be enforced in all cities, territories, and places of whatever\r\nkingdom or nation, and which were to have authority even without\r\npublication.”\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of 1607, Sarpi was set upon by three assassins (two\r\nof whom were monks) and was very nearly killed. He was in fact stabbed\r\nin fifteen places. The attempt was (not unnaturally) charged to the\r\npapal representatives in Venice and did not a little to embitter the\r\ncontest between the city and the pope.[37]\r\n\r\nSir Henry Wotton, writing from Venice to the Earl of Salisbury in\r\nSeptember, 1607, says of Sarpi:\r\n\r\n   “Now to say yet a little more of this man upon whom and his\r\n   seedes there lyeth so great a work, he seemeth as in countenance\r\n   as in spirit liker to Philip Melanchthon than to Luther, and\r\n   peradventure a fitter instrument to overthrow the falsehood\r\n   by degrees than by a sodayne, which accordeth with a frequent\r\n   saying of his own: That in these operations _non bisogna far\r\n   salti_. He is by birth a Venetian, and well-skilled in the\r\n   humour of his own country. For learning, I think I may justly\r\n   call him the most deep and general scholar of the world, and\r\n   above other parts of knowledge he seemeth to have looked very\r\n   far into the subtelties of the Canonists, which part of skill\r\n   gave him introduction into the Senate. His power of speech\r\n   consisteth rather in the soundness of reason than in any other\r\n   natural habilitie. He is much frequented and much intelligenced\r\n   of all things that passe, and lastly, his life is the most\r\n   irreprehensible and exemplar that hath ever been known.”--Public\r\n   Record Office, State Papers, Venice, Misc. 12, f. 805.\r\n\r\nIn November 1607 the Earl writes to Wotton:\r\n\r\n   “SIR HENRY WOTTON,--His Majesty hath well approved your care and\r\n   industry, and he hath commanded me to return you thanks for it,\r\n   being much pleased in the constant and magnanimous proceedings\r\n   of that State upon all occasions offered, and particularly in\r\n   the carriadge of the matter concerning il Padre Paolo, of whose\r\n   escape from so foule an assassinate his Majesty is right glad,\r\n   as he expressed himself to the Venetian Ambassador here at his\r\n   last audience, to whom he did also make known his particular\r\n   good declination towards il Padre Paolo, for his learning,\r\n   modesty and zeale in the defence of so good a cause as is the\r\n   sovereign power of an estate which hath dependence of none but\r\n   of God against the usurpations of the Pope of Rome, who being\r\n   not only contented to have intruded himself into the sole power\r\n   and authoritie for matters belonging to religion, doth seek\r\n   also cunningly to wynd himself, by little and little into the\r\n   civil government and lift himself up above all the Monarchs of\r\n   the Earth, as the examples in that State and elsewhere to make\r\n   manifest; for which also his Breve against the oath of obedience\r\n   here may serve for an instance, whereof I do send you a copy\r\n   here enclosed, together with another Breve, which for better\r\n   explication of the former hath since been published at Rome, to\r\n   prevent all exceptions that might be conceived against it, both\r\n   which you may impart to the partie you wrote of, for his better\r\n   satisfaction and encouragement in the course he hath begun, to\r\n   which His Majesty wishes all good success, for the propagation\r\n   of God’s glory.”\r\n\r\nIn 1892, a Monument to Sarpi was erected in Venice with funds secured\r\nby public subscription. This monument commemorates not only the life\r\nand work of a high-minded, far-seeing patriot, but the successful issue\r\nof the long contest waged by Venice against Rome in behalf of the\r\nfreedom of the press.\r\n\r\n\r\n=2. Spain and the Papacy, 1559–1770.=--From the beginning of\r\nthe policy of censorship down to the date of the issue of the latest\r\nIndex, the Papacy maintained its claims as the sole authority to make\r\ndefinitions of faith or of morals and to the exclusive control of the\r\nsupervision of literature. The record shows, however, that outside\r\nof certain divisions of Italy, the papal decrees in the matter of\r\ncensorship secured scant obedience. Spain, which continued through the\r\ncenturies to be the most orthodox of States, proved the least willing\r\nto recognise, in the matter of censorship, the authority of Rome.\r\nMontanus is authority for the statement that the issue in 1559, of\r\nthe first Roman Index of Paul IV excited the indignation of scholars\r\nthroughout the world, and that in Spain the Index was not permitted\r\nto be published. Valdés, the Inquisitor-General, announced that a\r\ncatalogue of books had been issued in Rome and further lists in Louvain\r\nand in Portugal, and that the Inquisition would itself prepare an Index\r\nor catalogue based upon these. This first Spanish Index was, however,\r\nframed with little respect for the papal decisions, and this policy was\r\nfollowed in the whole succeeding series. Books prohibited in Rome were\r\npermitted in Spain, and certain books were condemned in Spain which had\r\nsecured the approval of the papal authorities. After the Index of Trent\r\n(published in 1564) had given evidence of a more liberal policy on the\r\npart of the Roman Church, the Spanish authorities declined to accept\r\nthe modifications. Valdés, the Inquisitor-General, actually suspended\r\nthe publication of the decree of Pius IV and remonstrated with Philip\r\nII for permitting currency to these lax papal regulations. The decree\r\nin question had permitted the reading of Bibles in the vernacular and\r\nalso works written by heretics which had to do with matters outside\r\nof the domain of theology and religion. The Spanish authorities\r\nthereafter asserted the right of issuing Indexes under their own name\r\nand authority.[38] Condemnation of a book in Rome carried no weight in\r\nSpain unless such condemnation was itself confirmed by the Inquisition.\r\nWhen a book had been examined by the Inquisition, it was forbidden to\r\nmake any appeal in the matter to Rome.\r\n\r\nIn 1599, Juan de Mariana published in Valladolid a Latin treatise on\r\nthe _Institution of Royalty_ and dedicated it to Philip III. The\r\nwork was liberal in its general political tone and even intimated that\r\nthere are cases in which it may be lawful to put a monarch to death;\r\nbut it sustained with great acuteness the power of the Church and it\r\ntended to the establishment of a theocracy. The work was regularly\r\napproved by the censors of the press and is said to have been favoured\r\nby the policy of the Government which, in the time of Philip II, had\r\nsent assassins to cut off Elizabeth of England and the Prince of\r\nOrange. In France, where Henry III had been thus put to death a few\r\nyears before, and where Henry IV suffered a similar fate a few years\r\nafterward, the book excited a great sensation. Indeed, the sixth\r\nchapter of the first volume directly mentions, and by implication\r\ncountenances, the murder of the former of these monarchs and was\r\nclaimed, although without foundation, to have been among the causes\r\nthat stimulated Ravaillac to the assassination of the latter.... Among\r\nthe papers found after the death of Mariana was one on the errors\r\nin the government of the Society of Jesuits. It would appear that,\r\nnotwithstanding the strong support of the authority of the Church,\r\nthe learned author had incurred the enmity of the great Order which\r\ndirected the Inquisition.\r\n\r\nThe Congregation of the Index was instituted by Pius V in 1571.\r\nGregory XIII, in 1572, issued letters stating that the operations\r\nof the Congregation were in no way to interfere with the powers and\r\njurisdiction of the Holy Office in Spain. This utterance was in line\r\nwith that made by Paul III in 1544, in which the Pope declared, in\r\nreference to the Roman Inquisition that had been instituted in 1542,\r\nthat this was not to come into conflict in any way with the powers\r\nand the jurisdiction of the Inquisition in Spain. A similar statement\r\nwas made in 1587 by Sixtus V, and in 1595, Clement VIII specifically\r\ncommitted to the inquisitor in Spain cognizance in the matter of\r\nprohibiting books. There were, however, notwithstanding this series of\r\npapal briefs, occasional protests from Rome concerning the independent\r\naction of the Spanish Inquisition. Catalani, writing in 1680,\r\npronounces it “ridiculous to suppose that any one could confer on the\r\nSpanish Inquisition the power to rescind the judgments of Rome.”[39] A\r\nletter written by the secretary of the Congregation of the Index to the\r\nBishop of Malaga, takes the ground that the decrees of the Congregation\r\nwere binding on all Christians, and that the bishops were under\r\nobligations, in virtue of their episcopal authority, to punish those\r\nwho transgressed their decrees. Lea is of the opinion, however, that\r\nfew Spanish bishops would have ventured to put themselves in opposition\r\nto the Inquisition.[39] This conflict of authority produced a series\r\nof issues in regard to certain authors, among whom the most noteworthy\r\nwere Poza, Sa, and Moya. There is not space here to give the details\r\nof these issues. It may simply be said that, in the larger number of\r\ninstances, the Spanish Inquisition succeeded in maintaining, at least\r\nfor Spain, its own authority.\r\n\r\nThe contentions for the independent control of the national Church\r\nwere maintained with no less vigour in Spain than in France although\r\na somewhat different ground was taken by the Spanish writers. Whatever\r\nsuccess may have been secured in the claim of the Kings of Spain to\r\ncontrol the affairs of the Spanish Church, this control never took\r\nthe secular character which characterised much of the action of the\r\nadministration of France on ecclesiastical matters. The throne of\r\nSpain was so directly and so completely under the influence of the\r\nSpanish Inquisition that the direction of the affairs of the Spanish\r\nChurch, while often entirely independent of Rome, was, with hardly an\r\nexception, kept within complete ecclesiastical control. Under Urban\r\nVIII, were placed in the Index certain Spanish writers who had been\r\nprominent in maintaining the authority of the Crown in the control\r\nof the Spanish Church. The writers of this group came to be known as\r\nRegalists. The most noteworthy among them were Cevallos and Salgado.\r\nThe condemnation of these authors was, however, by no means accepted in\r\nSpain and was vigorously protested against by Philip III and by Philip\r\nIV. Later, there came into the Roman Index a long series of treatises\r\nby Spanish, Portuguese, Neapolitan, and Sicilian Regalists who were\r\nmaintaining the views originally presented by Cevallos and Salgado. In\r\n1610, a treatise by Cardinal Baronius, in which strong ground was taken\r\nfor the authority of the pope to control Church appointments and Church\r\nproperty in Sicily, was, under an edict of Philip III, prohibited for\r\nSicily and also for Spain, and the printing or circulation of copies\r\nwas forbidden under heavy penalty.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish kings had in practice usually been able to maintain the\r\n_regalias_ or rights which they held to be inherent in the Crown, but\r\nthere were still questions left to be debated by publicists and canon\r\nlawyers. The advocates of the royal prerogative were known as Regalists\r\nand came naturally into antagonism with the authority of Rome and with\r\nthe contentions of the Ultramontanists. The issue was complicated\r\nby the determination of the Inquisition to maintain at any cost the\r\nsupremacy of its jurisdiction over that of all secular tribunals.[40]\r\nThe Inquisition was able to utilise its powers of censorship to sustain\r\nits aggressions upon the other departments of government. In the\r\nIndex of Clement VIII, published in 1596, the instructions that had\r\nbeen reprinted in the successive Indexes ordered the expurgation of\r\nall propositions which were antagonistic to ecclesiastical liberty,\r\nimmunity, and jurisdiction. In 1606, the Jesuit Henriquez, in his\r\ntreatise entitled _De Clavibus Romani Pontificis_, defended the right\r\nof appeal from the ecclesiastical courts to the Royal Council (of\r\nSpain). By order of the papal nuncio, the edition was cancelled so\r\nsuccessfully that only three or four copies survived. In 1618, in a\r\ntreatise by Cevallos, a similar contention was maintained on behalf\r\nof the authority of the State. In 1624, this work was prohibited\r\nby a separate decree, notwithstanding the application made by the\r\nKing (Philip III) through his ambassador at Rome, to prevent the\r\ncondemnation of a book that maintained the rights inherent in the\r\nsovereign. The censorship authorities of Spain declined to ratify the\r\npapal decree. In a case such as this, the Inquisition and the Crown\r\nhad interests in common. If the Crown had failed to vindicate its\r\nindependence, the Inquisition would have been reduced to subjection\r\nto the Roman Congregations.[41] When the Inquisition failed in its\r\nduties in regard to the examination of books before publication,\r\nthe State assumed for itself the direct exercise of the functions\r\nof condemnation and suppression. In 1694, a treatise attributed\r\nto Barambio was issued under the title of _Casos reservados a su\r\nSantidad_, in which the royal prerogative was impugned. The book was\r\nnever placed upon the Index, but it was formally condemned under royal\r\ndecree, and the edition was ordered cancelled. In 1760, King Carlos III\r\nissued regulations prescribing the rules respecting papal briefs, and\r\nprescribing further the system under which the censorship functions of\r\nthe Inquisition were to be kept under subordination to the State. The\r\ndecree was recalled in 1763, but was reissued in 1768 with an appeal\r\nto the spirit of the _Constitution_ of Benedict XIV, issued in 1753,\r\nunder which _Constitution_ the proceedings of the Roman Congregations\r\nhad been reformed. No edict concerning censorship was thereafter to\r\nbe published until it had been submitted to and approved by the King.\r\nThe Inquisition was thus placed under wholesome restrictions, but,\r\nalthough it could not openly resist the royal prerogative, in practice\r\nit continued to condemn books in secret without giving a hearing to the\r\nauthors, and to a great extent rendered the submission to the King a\r\nmere formality after the publication of the edict of prohibition. It is\r\nLea’s conclusion that, as a result of the long series of contests, the\r\nState gradually succeeded in asserting for its own protection the power\r\nof sovereignty, and did not hesitate to exercise the function which had\r\nat first been relegated exclusively to the Inquisition.\r\n\r\nIn 1751, an issue arose between Spain and Rome over the Catechism of\r\nMesengui. In this case the Spanish and Roman censors were in accord.\r\nThe contest represented an attempt on the part of King Carlos III to\r\nfree the throne from the domination of the Inquisition. The catechism\r\nin question was contained in six volumes entitled _Exposition de la\r\nDoctrine Chrétienne_. It was published in 1744 and was placed on\r\nthe Index in 1757. It proved particularly obnoxious to the Jesuits\r\nand, at the instance of their general, Ricci, it was again condemned\r\nunder a formal Bull. The main ground for the antagonism to the book\r\nwas its utterances in regard to the claim of the popes to supremacy\r\nover sovereigns. Its condemnation was virtually a challenge to all the\r\nmonarchs of Europe. King Carlos forbade the publication of the Bull\r\nin Spain; the inquisitor-general, in defiance of the royal authority,\r\ncaused the Bull to be distributed throughout the churches and convents\r\nof Spain. A royal edict of 1762 ordered that no Bull or papal letter\r\nissued from Rome should be published without having been first\r\npresented to the King by the nuncio and having been approved. This\r\nedict was withdrawn in 1763 under pressure brought to bear upon the\r\nKing by his confessor, but it was reissued in 1768. With the close of\r\nthe reign of Carlos, the royal edict fell, however, into abeyance, and\r\nthe Inquisition again secured for itself full control of the matter of\r\ncensorship.\r\n\r\n\r\n=3. Controversies concerning the Gallican Church, 1600–1758.=--While\r\nthere was an increasing tendency on the part, not only of the civil\r\nauthorities in Paris but also on that of the divines of the Sorbonne,\r\nto bring into condemnation the works of the more extreme of the\r\nUltramontane writers, this policy had as one result the directing of\r\nthe attention of the authorities in Rome to the series of treatises\r\nby French jurists and theologians in which was contested the claim of\r\nthe pope to authority in civil matters, and in which was upheld the\r\nclaim to independent authority on the part of the Gallic Church and\r\nthe right of the king to control the appointments in the Church. The\r\nFrench writers gave special attention to the responsibilities of the\r\nFrench bishops in regard to the control of the Church property of their\r\ndioceses, responsibilities which, according to the French view, were\r\nto be discharged not to Rome but to the State authorities. Among the\r\nwriters of this Gallican school of thought whose names came into the\r\nIndex during the 17th century may be noted the jurists, Simon Vigor,\r\nLouis Servin, and Pithon Du Puy; the theologians Edmond Richer, Véron,\r\nde Marca, Gerbais, and Boileau. The treatise of the latter had been\r\nwritten under the instructions of Richelieu. These censorships of the\r\nHoly See secured as a series no recognition in France. The condemnation\r\nof the treatise of Rabardeau was, however, confirmed by an assembly of\r\nthe French clergy. In one way or another, the authority of the Holy\r\nSee made itself felt in France. Richer, for instance, even before the\r\nformal prohibition in Rome of his writings, was, at the instance of\r\nthe authorities in Rome, dispossessed by the French Government from\r\nhis post as syndic of the Sorbonne. De Marca, who in 1642 had been\r\nnominated as bishop, was refused confirmation by the Holy See on the\r\nground of the condemnation of his treatise _De concordia sacerdotii et\r\nimperii_, and it was only in 1647, when after long negotiations he had\r\nmade retractation of the doctrine presented in this thesis, that he was\r\ngiven authority to take charge of his diocese. In the Spanish Index,\r\nare entered a few only of the titles of these French defenders of the\r\nauthority of the State which had been condemned in Rome.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Declaration of the Sorbonne, 1663]\r\n\r\nIn May, 1663, the divines of the Sorbonne, on the ground of the\r\ndevelopment of extreme Ultramontane views, published the following\r\ndeclaration: I. It is the contention of this faculty that the pope\r\npossesses no authority whatsoever concerning matters belonging to\r\nthe State or affecting the control on the part of the most Christian\r\nKing over matters of State. This faculty has, in fact, always opposed\r\nthe contentions of those who hold for even an indirect authority on\r\nthe part of the Church in State matters. II. It is the doctrine of\r\nthis faculty that the Christian King recognises in matters of State\r\nno higher authority than God himself. III. It is the doctrine of\r\nthis faculty that the subjects of the king can, under no pretext or\r\nsuggestion, be freed from their obligation of loyalty and obedience to\r\nthe monarch. IV. The faculty can approve no propositions or theories\r\nwhich are opposed to the complete freedom of the Gallican Church or to\r\nthe full authority for this kingdom of the canon law of France. The\r\nfaculty denies that the pope has the authority to issue instructions\r\nthat are contrary to the authority of these canons. This faculty holds\r\nthat the authority of the pope does not take precedence of that of a\r\ngeneral council of the Church. V. This faculty holds that without the\r\ncollaboration of the Church as expressed in a general council, the pope\r\ndoes not possess infallibility. This declaration was the view which was\r\nlater confirmed, first by the Parliament of Paris, and later by the\r\nKing (Louis XIV). The King at the same time prohibited the printing or\r\ndistribution of any writings maintaining contrary doctrine. In 1664\r\nand 1665, the Sorbonne published a censure of certain Ultramontane\r\npropositions which had been found in books by de Vernant and Guimenius.\r\nThese censures were themselves condemned in very sharp terms in a Bull\r\nissued in 1665 by Alexander VII. The Parliament of Paris promptly\r\nprohibits the publication of the Bull and confirms the censures of\r\nthe Sorbonne. Diplomatic negotiations followed but did not succeed\r\nin bringing any satisfactory conclusion for the issue. In 1671, was\r\npublished the _Exposition de la Doctrine de l’Église Catholique_,\r\nby Bossuet, a treatise which, while it by no means supported the\r\ncontentions of the Holy See, found in Rome a favourable reception and\r\nsecured the individual commendation of Innocent XI.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Rights of the Crown in Ecclesiastical Matters]\r\n\r\nIn 1673, Louis XIV made claim for a material extension of the rights\r\nof the Crown over the appointments in the French dioceses and for the\r\ncontrol of the property of the French Church. This declaration of the\r\nKing brought about a sharp conflict with Innocent XI, which continued\r\nuntil 1682. In that year, a statement of principles arrived at by the\r\nGallican Church and presented in four articles brought the earlier\r\nissue to a close. As a result of this first contest, one or two French\r\npublications came into the Index. Among these was a treatise by the\r\nJesuit Rapin (published anonymously), prohibited in 1680. As late as\r\n1710, was prohibited, by a brief of Clement XI, a volume by Andoul\r\non the matter of the Regalia rights. This papal brief the Parliament\r\nof Paris refused to confirm and, in 1712, the Inquisition therefore\r\ncondemned the declaration that had been issued by the Parliament.\r\nA similar course of condemnations had taken shape in 1680, in which\r\nyear a previous letter or enactment of the Parliament had been in like\r\nmanner condemned by the Inquisition of Rome. In 1682, the assembly of\r\nthe French clergy presented a conclusion in support of the contention\r\nof the Crown in regard to the Regalia rights, which conclusion was\r\nexpressed in the following declaration:\r\n\r\nI. To the pope has been given by God no authority over civil matters\r\nof State. In these matters, kings and princes are subject to no\r\necclesiastical authority, and they cannot either directly or indirectly\r\nbe brought under the control of the Church, nor can their subjects be\r\nfreed through any ecclesiastical intervention from the loyalty and\r\nobedience due from them to their civil rulers.\r\n\r\nII. The pope possesses full control in spiritual affairs, as specified\r\nin the conclusions arrived at during the fourth and fifth sessions of\r\nthe Council of Constance. The Church of France takes the ground that\r\nthese conclusions arrived at in the council did not apply only to the\r\ntime of the schism but remained of binding authority.\r\n\r\nIII. The Apostolic authority is always to be exercised subject to the\r\nrestrictions of the canon law; and as far as France is concerned, the\r\nlaws of the monarchy and the old customs and regulations of the French\r\nChurch are not to be interfered with.\r\n\r\nIV. It is the case that in matters of faith, the decision of the\r\npope retains a controlling influence and his decrees are rightly\r\nto be issued to all the churches of the world. The papal judgment\r\nis, however, not to be held as infallible, final, or not open to\r\nmodification unless and until it has secured the assent of the Church\r\nuniversal, such assent as is expressed through the conclusions of the\r\ngeneral council.\r\n\r\nThis declaration was, in March, 1682, confirmed under the edict of\r\nLouis XIV, duly registered by the Parliament of Paris. The declaration\r\nbrought out not a little antagonism and criticism in Rome but was not\r\nat once condemned. In 1691, however, a brief of Alexander VIII declared\r\nthat the conclusions of this convention of 1682, and the edicts in\r\nwhich the same were represented, were to be considered as null and\r\nvoid. Through the prohibition of various writings in which the opinions\r\nof this declaration were defended, the papal view in regard to the\r\nsame was also made clearly evident. In 1684, was prohibited, under a\r\nspecial brief of Innocent XI, a treatise from Natalis, in 1685, one\r\nfrom Neimburg, in 1688, one from Dupin. During the same period, the\r\nIndex Congregation condemned writings to the same purpose by Choiseul,\r\nBorjon, Fleury, Févret, Arnauld, and others. The defence of the French\r\nposition made by Bossuet was also under consideration for condemnation\r\nbut was never formally prohibited.\r\n\r\nThe following statement from the historian Dejob, while referring to\r\nissues that were under discussion at the Council of Trent, is equally\r\napplicable to opinion in France on ecclesiastical organisation in the\r\nsucceeding century:\r\n\r\n   “Frenchmen of the sixteenth century found as a rule no\r\n   attraction in puritanism, in mysticism, or in epicureanism.\r\n   They approved of the conclusions of the Council of Trent in\r\n   maintaining against the Protestants the invocation of the\r\n   Saints, the use (as symbols) of images, the feeling for the\r\n   ceremonials of religious observance. Feeling assured that all\r\n   homage was actually and finally addressed to God, they approved\r\n   the action of the Council in maintaining for the government\r\n   Church a monarchical hierarchy, always provided that the\r\n   national clergy should lose none of its privileges, and that the\r\n   prerogatives of the King should not be assailed. Finally, they\r\n   realised that Catholicism had the advantage of being in accord\r\n   with the feeling of the people and with justice and common\r\n   sense, in defending against the partisans of predestination the\r\n   belief in the freedom of the will and in justification by works;\r\n   for, while concerning themselves little with equality under\r\n   the law, they held stoutly to equality before God. It may, in\r\n   fact, be said that their theory of relations of man before God\r\n   could be summed up in the three famous words that were adopted\r\n   by their descendants in expressing a political ideal: liberty,\r\n   equality, fraternity....\r\n\r\n   “They believed further that while it was not the duty of\r\n   believers to abandon the joys of this world, their salvation\r\n   in the world to come could be assured only through self-denial\r\n   and penitence. In accepting the aims and the ideals of the\r\n   Counter-reformation, France was, therefore, called upon for no\r\n   sacrifice of convictions or of practice.”[42]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Gallican Church Historians]\r\n\r\nIn 1684, 1685, and 1687, Innocent XI prohibited in special briefs\r\nthe Church history of Alexander; in 1685, an historical treatise by\r\nNeimburg; in 1687, the same author’s biography of Gregory I, and\r\nin 1689 a group of other of his writings. Between 1662 and 1693, a\r\nseries of treatises by de Launoy on Church history and Church law were\r\nprohibited. In 1688, a brief of Innocent XI prohibits the treatise\r\non Church law of Dupin, and in 1693, the Inquisition prohibits the\r\n_Bibliothèque_ of the same author. Later, the remainder of his\r\nworks came into the Index. In 1707, the writings of Tillemont were\r\ndenounced, but were saved from prohibition through a protest on the\r\npart of certain Roman scholars. The Church history of Fleury escaped\r\nthe Index and of his works on Church law, only the _Catéchisme\r\nHistorique_ was prohibited and with a _d.c._ The learned Mabillon\r\ncame under consideration with the Index authorities more than once.\r\nIn 1703, a treatise of Mabillon, which had to do with the misuse and\r\nmisinterpretation of certain relics taken from the Roman catacombs, was\r\nsharply criticised but escaped formal prohibition with the instruction\r\nthat Mabillon must produce an improved edition. His _Traité des Études\r\nMonastiques_ was prohibited in the Italian edition. The Church history\r\nof the French Jesuit Avrigny, covering the period of 1600–1718, was\r\nprohibited on the ground of its Gallican views. Through a special brief\r\nwas condemned, in 1740, the translation by Le Courayer of Sarpi’s\r\n_History of the Council of Trent_. Benedict XIV decided to recall the\r\nprohibition of the Church history of Alexander, but at the same time\r\nplaced on the Index a series of treatises of Roncaglia the conclusions\r\nin which were practically identical with those of Alexander.\r\n\r\nAmong the works condemned by the State may be cited:\r\n\r\nBellarmin, _Tractatus de potestate summi Pontificis in temporalibus_,\r\nRome, 1610, condemned under a decree of the Parliament of Paris\r\nin November, 1610, on the following ground: _Contenant une fausse\r\net détestable proposition, tendante à l’éversion des puissances\r\nsouveraines ordonnées et établies de Dieu, soulévement des sujets\r\ncontre leurs princes, soustraction de leur obéissance, induction\r\nd’attenter à leurs personnes et états, troubler le repos et la\r\ntranquillité publique_.\r\n\r\nCasaubon, Isaac, _De libertate ecclesiastica_. This book was condemned\r\nby Henry IV, who undertook to have collected and destroyed all the\r\ncopies that had been brought into print.\r\n\r\nCharron, Pierre, _Traité sur la sagesse_, Bordeaux, 1661. The first\r\nedition was condemned by the Sorbonne until it should have been\r\nexpurgated. The later revised editions secured approval.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Works Connected with the Gallican Church]\r\n\r\nIn 1729, Benedict XIII wrote a monograph which was to be read before\r\nthe Church universal on the commemoration of the feast of Gregory VII,\r\nand in this paper he gave particular emphasis to the statement that\r\nGregory had deposed the Emperor Henry IV. This papal utterance brought\r\nout protests on the part of a number of the parliaments and bishops\r\nof France. In four briefs, Benedict condemned and ordered cancelled\r\npastoral letters of three bishops which contained animadversions on his\r\nmonograph, and he included at the same time in a general condemnation\r\nall resolutions, decrees, or protests which had emanated from civil\r\nauthorities concerning the same matter. The _Officium_ containing\r\nthe objectionable statement which Benedict had ordered to be read on\r\nthe feast-day, was itself prohibited throughout the Austrian dominions.\r\n\r\nUnder Benedict XIV, were prohibited a series of writings which\r\nundertook to defend certain measures attempted in 1749 by the\r\nGovernment of France for the taxation of the clergy. The _Decr.\r\nGeneralia_, ii, 9, contain a general prohibition of all works which\r\nbring into question the immunity (from taxation) of the property of\r\nthe Church. Shortly after the death of Benedict XIV, a group of six\r\nmonographs came into the Index which had to do with the question\r\nwhether a converted Jew, by name Barach Levi, was to be permitted\r\nto take to himself another wife during the lifetime of the original\r\nwife, who had decided to remain in the Jewish faith. The same question\r\nhad arisen a little earlier in France and had been decided in the\r\naffirmative by Benedict XIV. The authority for the contention that the\r\nconvert was free so to act rests upon 1 Corinthians vii, 15.\r\n\r\n\r\n=4. Ecclesiastical-Political Contests, 1700–1750.=--Clement XI\r\n(1700–1721) plays an important part in the history of the Index. He\r\nis the author of the Bull _Unigenitus_, of the Bull _Vineam\r\nDomini Sabaoth_, and of the Bull concerning Chinese usages, and\r\nhe was responsible for the schism of Utrecht. He issued a longer\r\nseries of briefs than are to be credited to any other pope for the\r\nprohibition of particular works, and to these are to be added a great\r\nnumber of decrees published under his orders by the Inquisition and by\r\nthe Congregation of the Index, which carried general prohibitions of\r\nwhole classes of publications. Clement found himself involved, during\r\nthe twenty years of his rule, in serious contests and complications\r\nwith the several States of Europe, contests which had as one result\r\nthe swelling of the Index lists with a great number of controversial\r\nwritings. Under the Index policy of this period, were condemned not\r\nonly works which took ground antagonistic to the claims of the pope,\r\nor in defence of the claims of civil authority, but a great series\r\nof civil enactments, State decrees, and court decisions, with the\r\npurport of which the Holy See found reason for dissatisfaction. Public\r\ndocuments and official records of this general character could of\r\ncourse be formally condemned, and could in form be prohibited; but it\r\nwas not practicable, under any authority possessed by the pope, to\r\ndo anything to prevent such enactments, court decisions, etc., from\r\nbecoming known and from remaining in force in the territories in which\r\nthey applied. The so-called prohibition on the part of the pope may be\r\nconsidered as simply the expression of a pious opinion, and differs\r\ntherefore in its purpose and in its application from the prohibitions\r\npreviously attempted by means of the Index. Among the decisions of\r\nmagistrates which came into the Index during this period, were a long\r\nseries taken from the Neapolitan courts, decisions which indicated\r\nstrained relations between the Government of Sicily and the Holy See.\r\n\r\nThe most important book of the time having to do with these Sicilian\r\ncomplications was the _Political History of the Kingdom of Naples_, by\r\nPietro Giannone. This was published just after the death of Clement\r\nand was promptly prohibited under the general policy that had been\r\nin force. By the time of Benedict XIV, the complications between the\r\nHoly See and the Governments of the Catholic States had been pretty\r\nwell straightened out and the Index of Benedict contains therefore the\r\ntitles of but very few political works. Through a special decree of\r\nthe Congregation of January, 1729, was prohibited a history written\r\nby Count Franc. Maria Ottieri, and published in Rome in 1728, of the\r\n_War of the Spanish Succession, 1696–1725_. The book was condemned on\r\nthe ground that it contained expressions injurious, if not libellous,\r\nconcerning certain princes and political leaders. There seems in\r\nthis case to have been no objection on theological or ecclesiastical\r\ngrounds. The decree states that the condemnation had received the\r\npersonal approval of Benedict XIII. Under the instructions of Benedict\r\nXIV, however, the title was taken out of the Index.\r\n\r\nIn 1746, Benedict XIV ordered the prohibition of a treatise by Garrido,\r\ngeneral of the Spanish Congregation of the Benedictines, which had been\r\nprinted in Madrid in 1745 under the title: _Concordia prelatorum:\r\nTractatus duplex de unione ecclesiarum et beneficiorum_, etc. This\r\nwork was also condemned by the Spanish Inquisition, which was as\r\nheretofore under the control of the Dominicans.\r\n\r\nIt is the contention of those upholding the reasonableness of the\r\nclaims of the Church that there need be no conflict of authority\r\nbetween the powers spiritual and the powers temporal; that the\r\nallegiance and obedience should be entire towards the sovereign in\r\nmatters temporal and entire towards the pope in matters spiritual. In\r\nthe application of this apparently simple principle, it was inevitable\r\nthat there should arise differences of interpretation. From the\r\necclesiastical point of view, it was claimed that all ecclesiastical\r\nproperty was to be classed with the matters spiritual; to the same\r\nclass belonged of necessity ecclesiastical persons, thus securing for\r\nsuch persons immunities, both personal and real; while from these two\r\nclaims arises the jurisdiction of the Church in matters both civil and\r\ncriminal. In marriage, for instance, the sacrament is the essential\r\nthing, from which arises the inference that marriage is to be regulated\r\nby ecclesiastical law. Finally, every human act may be the subject of\r\nsin, and on this ground the Church has received divine precepts and has\r\ninstituted ecclesiastical laws for the regulation of all actions.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that, if these assumptions be accepted, there are very\r\nfew human activities the regulation of which belongs outside of the\r\nauthority of the Church. This is in substance the view presented by an\r\nAustrian Romanist previously quoted, who was writing on behalf of the\r\nliberties of the Austrian Church.[43]\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Joseph Berington, writing in 1760, uses, in describing the\r\necclesiastical polity, the following language:\r\n\r\n   “The mode of government which Rome maintains in this kingdom\r\n   (England) and from which in no kingdom it ever departed but when\r\n   driven by hard necessity, draws very near to that feudal system\r\n   of polity, to which the nations of Europe were once subject. It\r\n   contained one sovereign as suzerain monarch in whose hands was\r\n   lodged the _supremum dominium_, and this he apportioned out\r\n   to a descending series of vassals who, all holding of him _in\r\n   capite_, returned him service for the benefits they received\r\n   in honours, jurisdiction on lands; and to this service they were\r\n   bound by gratitude, which was strengthened by an oath of fealty.\r\n   The application of the system to the sovereign power of the\r\n   pontiff and to a chain of descending vassalage in archbishops,\r\n   bishops, and the inferior orders in the ministry, is direct and\r\n   inevitable.”[44]\r\n\r\nCatalani, writing in 1738, contends that the oath of allegiance to\r\nthe pope expresses not only a profession of canonical obedience, but\r\nan oath of fealty not unlike that which vassals took to their direct\r\nlords.[45] He cites as an example, the first oath of the kind, that\r\ntaken by the Patriarch of Aquileia to Gregory VII, in 1079.\r\n\r\nMendham concludes, after reference to other authorities, that\r\nallegiance and obedience are divided in the most unfavourable sense\r\nand degree (particularly in the case of heretical rulers) when the\r\nsoul and conscience are to be given to a foreign (so-called) spiritual\r\nsovereign, while the actual temporal ruler can claim only what remains\r\nof his subject.[46]\r\n\r\nA long series of works came into print during the last half of the\r\n18th century having to do with the issues that had arisen between the\r\nPapacy, under Clement XIII and Pius VI and the Governments of Venice\r\nand of Naples. With a few exceptions, doubtless accidental, these works\r\nwere duly prohibited, either by the Inquisition or the Congregation.\r\nThe similar contests between Clement XIII and the Duke of Parma did\r\nnot bring into the Index any fresh titles. A series of Spanish works\r\nwritten against the claims and contentions of the Holy See, printed\r\nduring the same period, also escaped the attention of the editors\r\nof the Roman Indexes. The Indexes of this period contain the titles\r\nof a number of treatises on Church and State issued by the French\r\nauthor, Richet, and also of a series of monographs on the reform of\r\nthe religious orders and on the policy to be pursued by the State with\r\nits non-Catholic citizens. The list also includes a monograph on the\r\nauthority of the pope, published in Amsterdam in connection with the\r\ncontroversy concerning the Church at Utrecht.\r\n\r\nIn 1764, were prohibited under a separate decree of the Congregation,\r\na treatise by Bishop Frevorius, published in 1763, together with a\r\nseries of less important works, all of which were concerned with the\r\nissues that had arisen between the Holy See and certain of the German\r\nbishoprics. In 1784, the Congregation prohibits the Introduction to\r\nEcclesiastical Law written by Eybel; and in the following year was\r\ncondemned, by a brief of Pius VI, the treatise by the same author on\r\nConfession. In 1786, the monograph by Eybel, issued under the title of\r\n_Was ist der Papst?_, was also prohibited in a separate brief. The\r\neditors of the Index evidently found it impracticable, however, to make\r\nplace for the long series of similar publications by the controversial\r\nwriters of Germany which came into print during the same period. The\r\ntwo or three titles selected cover some of the least important of\r\nthe series. The selection was apparently made without any adequate\r\nknowledge of the material to be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n=5. England and the Papacy.=--On the 25th of February, 1570, Sixtus V\r\nissues his Bull against Queen Elizabeth, a copy of which Bull was, on\r\nMay 15th, nailed on the door of the palace of the Bishop of London. The\r\nPope describes Elizabeth as “a bastard and usurper,” the “persecutor\r\nof God’s saints.” He declares that it would be “an act of virtue to\r\nbe repaid with plenary indulgence and forgiveness of all sins, to\r\nlay violent hands upon Elizabeth and to deliver her into the hands\r\nof her enemies.” He declares Philip of Spain to be the rightful King\r\nof England and the Defender of the Faith. In the same year, Cardinal\r\nAllen, an Englishman, printed in Antwerp a pamphlet entitled _An\r\nAdmonition to the Nobility and People of England and Ireland_, in\r\nwhich, says Motley, Queen Elizabeth is “accused of every crime and vice\r\nthat can pollute humanity.” These charges are set forth with “foul\r\ndetails unfit for the public eye in these more decent days.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The English Oath of Allegiance 1606–1853]\r\n\r\nAn important question in the relations between the Papacy and England\r\nthat called for attention under Paul V, was the issue that arose with\r\nJames I of England after the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot. An\r\norder had been issued by King James in July, 1606, for a fresh oath\r\nof allegiance to be taken by English Catholics. The Pope forbade the\r\nCatholics to take this oath because it included the statement that\r\nthe claim of the Pope to have the right to depose kings and princes\r\nand to absolve their subjects from allegiance was godless, infamous,\r\nand heretical. The several statements brought into print on behalf\r\nof King James in defence of the wording of the oath, were themselves\r\ncondemned by the Inquisition. The treatises of the English Catholics,\r\nWilliam and John Barclay and Thomas Preston (“Roger Widdrington”),\r\nin reply to the defence by Bellarmin of the papal contentions, were\r\npromptly placed upon the Index in connection with a long series of\r\nlater monographs on the same subject. The oath of allegiance was, under\r\nUrban VIII in 1626, and later under Innocent X and Alexander VII, again\r\ndeclared to be invalid. Towards the end of the 18th century, an oath\r\nof allegiance substantially identical was, however, approved by six\r\ntheological faculties in England and by the Apostolic vicar in England\r\nand this decision was accepted without protest by Rome. In the oath of\r\nallegiance (which is not to be confused with the oath of supremacy, the\r\nlatter not being required from his Catholic subjects) James required\r\nthe Catholics to acknowledge that he was the rightful King of England,\r\nthat the pope had no authority to dispossess him or to incite a foreign\r\nprince to war against him or to pardon his subjects for disobedience to\r\nBritish law. They were further called upon to swear that, irrespective\r\nof any papal decrees of deposition or any threat of excommunication,\r\nthey would remain loyal to the King, and further they were to declare\r\nas godless and as damnable the theory that the pope could release any\r\nsubject from obedience to his rightful sovereign. Finally, they were\r\ncalled upon to declare the belief that neither the pope nor any other\r\nauthority could release them from this oath. In 1608, James wrote a\r\ndefence of the oath, which was printed in a Latin version prepared by\r\nHenry Savile. In 1609, this treatise was prohibited by Paul V under\r\nthe penalty of _excommunicatio latae_, etc. A further prohibition was\r\nissued by the Inquisition some months later. A treatise by William\r\nBarclay, a Scotch Catholic, printed in 1609 (after the death of the\r\nauthor), presents the arguments against the authority, either direct or\r\nindirect, of the pope in secular matters. This was duly condemned in\r\nRome in 1610 and in Paris in 1612. It formed the text for the famous\r\ntreatise by Bellarmin, _Tractatus de potestate summi Pont. in rebus\r\ntemporalibus_. The treatise written by the Benedictine, Thomas Preston,\r\nunder the nom-de-plume of Roger Widdrington, _Apologia Card. Bellarmini\r\npro jure principium adv. suas ipsius rationes pro auctoritate papali_,\r\netc., printed in London in 1611, was prohibited in Rome in 1613 in\r\na general decree. In 1614, the Index of the Congregation issued a\r\nspecial decree prohibiting this work together with a second treatise\r\nof the same author. Later, were placed on the Index a further group\r\nof essays by Widdrington. Sarpi published in April, 1614, an analysis\r\nof the two earlier books of Widdrington, giving high praise to the\r\nscholarly authority of the author’s conclusions. These had an immediate\r\nbearing upon the contention of the Venetian Republic to control,\r\nwithout interference from the pope, its own civil affairs. In 1680,\r\nsixty divines of the Sorbonne rendered a judgment to the effect that\r\nthe Catholics in England could with a safe conscience swear loyalty\r\nto King James and accept the oath of allegiance. A monograph making\r\nrecord of this judgment, printed in London, in 1681, under the title\r\nof _English Loyalty Vindicated by the Divines_, or a _Declaration of\r\nThree-score Persons of the Sorbonne for the Oath of Allegiance_, was,\r\nin 1682, prohibited by the Inquisition. A monograph that secured a\r\nwide circulation, being printed in fact thirty-five times in fifteen\r\nyears, under the title of _An Abuse Misrepresented and Represented_,\r\nescaped formal condemnation, although it took strong ground in behalf\r\nof the English contention. In 1760, the theological faculties of\r\nParis, Louvain, Douay, Valladolid, Salamanca, and Alcala united in\r\na declaration to the effect that the pope possessed in England no\r\nauthority over civil affairs and had no power to release the subjects\r\nof the English king from the oath of allegiance, and that no Catholic\r\nwas under obligation to accept instructions from the authorities of the\r\nChurch that would interfere with this allegiance. In 1853, Professors\r\nRussell, Patrick Murray, and others of the Catholic College of Maynooth\r\ndeclared, in connection with a Parliamentary investigation, that,\r\naccording to their own opinion and to the purport of their teachings\r\nto their students, the pope possessed neither direct nor indirect\r\nauthority in the United Kingdom in secular matters. They stated further\r\nthat the contrary doctrine was now considered as practically obsolete.\r\n\r\n\r\n=6. The Gallicans and Liberal Catholics, 1845–1870.=--The contest\r\nof the Congregation of the Index against theological Gallicanism began\r\nin 1851 under Pius IX. Certain books of instruction utilised in the\r\nseminaries of France were, for the purpose of maintaining them in use\r\nagainst the criticisms of the Ultramontane press, revised with the\r\nelimination of material that could be classed as Gallican. Among the\r\nworks belonging to this period which were condemned on the ground of\r\ntheir Gallican or Liberal Catholic views may be noted the following:\r\n\r\nDupin, André M. J. J., _Manuel du Droit Publique-ecclésiastique\r\nFrançais_, printed in 1844, prohibited 1845. This manual presents\r\nin eighty-three articles the “Liberties” of the Gallican Church, the\r\ndeclaration of the clergy made in 1682 on the limits of ecclesiastical\r\npower, and the text of the Concordat.\r\n\r\nBailly, Louis, Canon of Dijon, _Theologia Dogmatica et Moralis, ad usum\r\nSeminariorum_, completed in eight volumes in 1789, reprinted with the\r\nrevision by Receveur in 1842, prohibited in 1852 with a _d.c._\r\n\r\nLequeux, J. F. M., _Manuale Compendium Juris Canonici ad usum\r\nSeminariorum_, printed in 1839, prohibited in 1851. The work\r\nhad been denounced by five of the French bishops. A decree of the\r\nCongregation issued in 1852 states that the author had “submitted\r\nhimself.”\r\n\r\nGuettée, l’Abbé, _L’Histoire de l’Église de France_, volumes i to\r\nvii, printed in Paris, 1847, condemned in 1852. The work had secured\r\nthe specific approval of no less than forty-two of the French bishops.\r\n\r\nThions, C., _Adresse au Pape Pie IX sur la Nécessité d’une Réforme\r\nReligieuse_, printed in 1848, prohibited in 1852.\r\n\r\nMontalembert, _Les Intérêts Catholiques au XIX^{me} Siècle_, published\r\nin 1852, received very sharp criticisms from the Ultramontane journals\r\nand from a number of the bishops, but escaped the Index. In fact no\r\nwork of this author was formally condemned in Rome.\r\n\r\nA number of the dioceses of France had, on the authority of a Bull\r\nof Pius V, issued in 1568, retained their individual mass books and\r\nbreviaries. In 1848, Pius IX issues a Bull recalling the permission\r\ngiven three centuries earlier by his predecessor and directing the use\r\nin all the dioceses of the Roman liturgy. One or two of the long series\r\nof writings which the Bull brought out were placed upon the Index.\r\nFrom 1852 on, there came into print a number of controversial writings\r\nconcerning the use in the schools of the heathen classics. No one of\r\nthese was placed upon the Index, but Pius IX, in an encyclical issued\r\nin March, 1853, emphasises the importance of a very careful selection\r\nof the heathen texts to be so utilised and the necessity, in the case\r\nof certain authors, of providing expurgated texts.\r\n\r\nBellarmin, in his treatise _De Summo Pontifice_, condemned pure\r\nmonarchy in the name of a limited monarchy. By the former he appears to\r\nhave understood a government (hardly to be conceived as practicable)\r\nin which the king would have ruled entirely by himself, while under\r\nthe second he was describing a restricting body made up of delegates\r\nwho, having been drawn from the ranks of the people, were invested by\r\nthe prince with an absolute authority and were made responsible to him\r\nalone. He denied for the pope the right to exercise a direct control\r\nover the states of the world, but claimed for the Papacy the privilege\r\nof interfering at will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                   EXAMPLES OF CONDEMNED LITERATURE\r\n\r\n   1.

Writings concerning the Papacy and the Inquisition,\r\n1600–1757.=--The Index contains but few of the polemic writings of\r\nthis period against the Papacy. A few however of the historical works\r\non the Papacy, both by Protestants and Catholics, were prohibited. The\r\nlists include a treatise of the Jesuit Riccioli on the infallibility\r\nof the pope, but this is entered with a _d.c._ The lists include\r\nalso a group of writings on the Inquisition, on the Index itself, on\r\nthe finance system of the papal chancellery, etc. Among these are some\r\nmonographs by Gregorio Leti (1630–1701), whose entire works secured\r\ncondemnation in 1686. Reusch points out that the history of the Papacy\r\nby Archibald Bower, which was first published in 1748 in seven volumes,\r\nand of which a number of editions appeared later, was overlooked by the\r\nIndex compilers. Bower was born in Scotland, but, becoming a Jesuit,\r\nhad held a professor’s chair in Italy in Fermo and in Macerata. In\r\n1726, he left Italy and became a member of the Church of England. His\r\ntreatise was of a character that might naturally have met criticism on\r\nthe part of the Congregation. The _History of the Inquisition_\r\nby Limborch, printed in Brussels, in 1693, was promptly prohibited in\r\n1694. In the same list, are included the titles of a number of less\r\nimportant treatises on the Inquisition.\r\n\r\n\r\n=2. Writings concerning the Churches of the East.=--The Index\r\nlists of the 17th and 18th centuries contain but few of the works\r\nof the Greek theologians. Among the authors of this group are to be\r\nnoted the names Lukaris, Nektarius, Philippus Cyprius, Catum Syrittus,\r\nand Sylvester Syropoli. Robert Creighton, professor in Cambridge,\r\nlater Bishop of Bath, had printed in The Hague in 1660 the _Vera\r\nHistoria_ of Syropoli, a record of the relations between the Greek\r\nand the Latin Church, which includes an account of the Council of\r\nFlorence. This was prohibited in 1682.\r\n\r\n\r\n=3. Patristic Writings and Pagan Classics.=--During the 17th\r\ncentury, a number of editions of the writings of the Fathers are\r\nplaced on the Index on the ground of the notes and commentaries of\r\nthe heretical editors. It was the case in the 17th as in the 16th\r\ncentury that the editors who had interested themselves in producing the\r\neditions of these works of the Fathers were in large part men whose\r\northodoxy had come into question. There were, in fact, but very few\r\neditions of the Fathers of the Church the editorial work in which had\r\nbeen in the hands of orthodox or conservative believers. Among the\r\neditions so prohibited, were the works of Cyprian with the notes of the\r\nFrenchman Maran, and the Letters of Chrysostom in the edition printed\r\nin Basel. Prohibited also was a work by Erigena in a German edition and\r\nthe history of the Council of Constance by von Hardt. In the list of\r\nclassics are to be found Italian editions of the works of Caesar, Ovid,\r\nAnacreon, and Lucretius.\r\n\r\n\r\n=4. Jewish Literature.=--In 1703, prohibitions were issued\r\ncovering a series of rabbinical writings, selected, as Reusch points\r\nout, with hardly any apparent policy or plan from a great mass of\r\nliterature of the same kind. The compilers had utilised in making\r\nup their titles the _bibliotheca rabbinica_ of Bartolocci and\r\nImbonati, which had been published between the years 1675–1694. In\r\n1755–1766, was printed a supplementary Index with additional titles\r\nof the same character. A further list, printed separately, covered\r\ncertain rabbinical writings which had been printed in Latin and in\r\nSpanish versions. In 1776, was prohibited a treatise by the Italian\r\nmonk Vincenti, which was strongly anti-Semitic, and a little later a\r\nresponse to this treatise also secured condemnation.\r\n\r\n\r\n=5. Historical Writings of the 17th Century.=--The list of historical\r\nwritings prohibited during the 17th century is very considerable but,\r\nas has been indicated for the lists of other groups of literature, is\r\nby no means comprehensive nor does it give evidence of any consistent\r\nscholarly selection. The prohibitions are by no means confined to works\r\nby Protestants. A number of Catholic historians succeeded in getting\r\ninto their texts phrases or statements that aroused opposition. In the\r\nIndex of Alexander VII, are given in the class of history only works in\r\nLatin; the later Indexes include a series of French and Italian titles\r\nand two English works, but nothing from the German writers. Reusch\r\npoints out that during the 17th and 18th centuries there were produced\r\nin Italy no works deserving of preservation having to do with general\r\nhistory. A translation of the _History of the World_ by Dupin and an\r\nItalian version of a condensed history published in London were both\r\nprohibited. The larger number of the titles comprise monographs on the\r\nvarious issues that arose in Italy and throughout Europe between the\r\necclesiastical and the civil authorities. Among the historical names\r\nto be noted is that of de Thou, whose History of his Own Times was\r\nprohibited in 1609. In 1610, in connection with certain applications\r\nmade to the authorities, the prohibition was modified to an instruction\r\nfor an expurgation of the work, but no expurgated edition ever came\r\ninto print. The work continued in circulation not only in France and\r\nother European States but in Venice. The _Histoire du Gouvernement\r\nde Venise_, by Houssaye, was prohibited in 1667. The miscellaneous\r\nworks of Francis Osborne, published in 1673, secured the honour of a\r\nprohibition in the list of Benedict in 1757. Johnson is quoted as\r\nsaying of Osborne: “A conceited fellow; were a man to write so now, the\r\nboys would throw stones at him.” The Italian historian, Pietro della\r\nValle, on returning in 1626 from a series of journeys, had a favourable\r\nreception from Urban VIII, and his account of Persia, printed in Venice\r\nin 1628, was issued with a license and with a special privilege. It\r\nwas, however, in 1629, prohibited with the specification _cum auctor\r\nat suum tantum agnoscat librum qui Romae impressus est_. As a fact,\r\nhowever, no edition of this work was ever printed in Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n=6. Protestant Jurists.=--During the first decade of the 17th century,\r\nthe Index includes the names of a group of Protestant jurists, chiefly\r\nGermans and Hollanders. The titles specified cover, in the main, books\r\nwhich had no material importance and which never even reached the\r\nhonour of a second printing. The subjects include not only books having\r\nto do with canon law or ecclesiastical relations but works of purely\r\npolitical importance. In the Spanish lists, the compilers have taken\r\nthe pains to add after the number of the book the term _d.c._, and for\r\na few works they themselves presented the expurgations required. In\r\neditions of the pandects and in the treatises having to do with the\r\npandects, the prohibitions cover a number of books on such subjects as\r\n_de summa trinitate de fide Catholica_ and _de haereticis et paganis_.\r\nThe Spanish Indexes include also certain treatises on usury (the\r\nauthorities taking the Church ground that interest was indefensible)\r\nand two essays having to do with the requirement of the permission of\r\nparents for marrying. A number of books which in the Roman Index are\r\nprohibited altogether, are presented by the Spanish compilers with the\r\nterm _d.c._ The noteworthy treatise of Puffendorf, _De statu Germanici\r\nImperii_, first published in 1667, did not come to the attention of\r\nthe Index compilers as a pernicious work until 1754. Other works by\r\nthe same author which secured condemnation are the French edition of\r\nhis introduction to the history of the great States, published in 1687\r\nand prohibited in 1693; the _De jure naturae et gentium_, published in\r\n1672 and prohibited in 1714; the _Introductio ad historiam Europaeam_,\r\npublished in 1704, prohibited in 1737; the _De officio hominis et\r\ncivis_, published in 1743, prohibited in 1752.\r\n\r\n\r\n=7. Italian Protestant Writings.=--During the 17th and 18th centuries,\r\nProtestant writings printed in Italian were published chiefly in\r\nSwitzerland. The only author of this group whose work came into any\r\ngeneral circulation was Pincenino, a preacher in Soglio. Four of his\r\ncontroversial treatises were prohibited by the Inquisition between the\r\nyears 1704–1714, and the publication of these brought out a number\r\nof replies from Catholic theologians. The name of Vicenzo Paravicino\r\ncame into the Index in connection with a number of translations of\r\nFrench Protestant writings, and also with editions of the Scriptures\r\nprinted in the vernacular. Edwin Sandys, a son of the Archbishop of\r\nYork (who is himself listed in Class I), printed, without his name, in\r\n1605, and with his name in 1629, a treatise entitled _A View of the\r\nState of Religion in the Western Part of the World, wherein the Roman\r\nReligion and the pregnant Policies of the Church of Rome to support\r\nthe same are notably displayed, with other memorable Discoveries and\r\nCommemorations_. The French and German translations of the book,\r\nprinted in Geneva in 1625 and 1626, were both condemned.\r\n\r\nIn 1621, was prohibited a history, printed in 1620, by Luglio (or\r\nParavicino) of the persecution and massacre by the Papists of the\r\nProtestants of Valtellina. This has to do with one division of the long\r\nseries of persecutions of the Waldenses.\r\n\r\n\r\n=8. Philosophical Writings, Natural Science, and Medicine,\r\n1660–1750.=--In 1663, the Congregation of the Index prohibits with\r\na _d.c._ the chief writings of Descartes (1596–1650); and in 1722\r\nprohibits with no restriction his _Meditationes_. This second\r\nprohibition was issued some eighty years after the publication of the\r\nwork. Reusch[47] explains that the prohibition of 1663 was intended\r\nto cover only specific divisions or propositions contained in these\r\nwritings, but no specification was made by the Congregation as to\r\nthe passages charged with heresy nor was any expurgated edition ever\r\nbrought into print. The commentators on Descartes point out that in any\r\ncase it would not have been practicable, without practically destroying\r\nthe entire statement of his system, to modify or correct the statements\r\nthat had evoked criticism. The chief objection raised by the Roman\r\ncritics was the view taken by Descartes of the philosophy of Aristotle.\r\nIt seems probable that in the case of this particular work the use of\r\nthe term _d.c._ did not indicate any expectation that the work would be\r\nissued in an expurgated edition, but was intended simply to express the\r\ncondemnation in somewhat milder form. The works of Nicholas Malebranche\r\n(1638–1715) were, with hardly an exception (although not under the\r\nterm _Opera omnia_), prohibited; but the philosophical writings\r\nof Gassendi, Mersenne, and Maignan, writings expressing the same\r\ngeneral school of thought, escaped the Index. In 1772, the writings\r\nof the Neapolitan Grimaldi, in reply to the treatise issued in 1694\r\nby the Jesuit de Benedictis, opposing the views of Descartes, were\r\nprohibited with a special condemnation. In 1679, nine years after its\r\npublication, was prohibited the treatise by Spinoza entitled _Tractatus\r\ntheologico-politicus_. This remains on the later Indexes, but as an\r\nanonymous work. In the same year were prohibited the _Opera postuma_\r\nof Spinoza which had been printed in Amsterdam, in 1667. The works of\r\nProtestant philosophical writers are but sparsely represented in the\r\nIndex and were probably but little known to the examiners of the Roman\r\nCongregation. The names of Leibnitz and Christian Wolff, for instance,\r\ndo not appear in the Index lists. The Spanish authorities declined to\r\nplace in their Indexes the works of Descartes, of Malebranche, or of\r\nSpinoza.\r\n\r\nUnder the heading of Philosophy, the Indexes of the 17th century\r\ncontain the names of Montaigne, Charron, Ramus, Bacon, Hobbes, Fludd,\r\nand Herbert of Cherbury. In 1709, Hobbes secured the distinction of\r\ncondemnation in the Roman list for his complete works, of which in\r\nthe earlier lists only single books had been prohibited. His writings\r\nescaped the attention, however, of the Spanish compilers. Julius\r\nCaesar Vanini, who was in 1619 burned in Toulouse as a propagator\r\nof atheism, and whose name stands in the Spanish Index in Class I,\r\nwith the specification _Impiissimus atheus_, finds place in the\r\nSpanish Index of 1623 only in connection with one work and that with\r\nthe restriction _d.c._ In the Index of Benedict XIV, the title was\r\nrepeated but the _d.c._ was cancelled.\r\n\r\nIn the Index of Alexander VII, the natural scientists are, with the\r\nnoteworthy exception of Galileo, represented only by a few alchemists\r\nand a group of physicians. Among the names here to be noted is that of\r\nLionardo di Capua, on the ground of certain sharp criticisms by him of\r\nthe accepted scholastic philosophy.\r\n\r\nThe name of the mystic Jacob Boehme is not included in any Roman Index\r\nbut finds place in Class I of the Spanish lists.\r\n\r\nThe prohibition in 1676 of the essays of Montaigne is connected with\r\nthe specification “in whatever language they may be printed.” The\r\nessays of Bacon that received attention from the Roman compilers are\r\nthe _De dignitate et augmentis scientiarum_ and the _De sapientia\r\nveterum_. Sotomayor has entered Franc. Baconus and Franc. Verulam in\r\nhis first class as two distinct authors. The Spanish Index of 1707\r\ncondemns of Bacon _Opera omnia_. The full name, Baron Verulam, appears\r\nfirst correctly in the Spanish Index of 1790. Of the many writings\r\nof Robert Fludd (†1637) only one, _Utriusque Cosmi_, etc., appears\r\nin the Index. The first work of Thomas Hobbes to receive attention\r\nwas the _Leviathan_, prohibited in 1703, about forty years after its\r\npublication. In 1709, however, thirty years after the author’s death,\r\nthe prohibition was made to include the _Opera omnia_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=9. Books on Magic and Astrology.=--The lists of the 17th century\r\ninclude the titles of a number of works on magic and astrology, books\r\nwhich apart from this record would long since have been entirely\r\nforgotten. The _Steganographie_ of the Abbé Trithenius was included\r\namong the books so prohibited, evidently under the impression that it\r\nhad to do with magic. In April, 1631, Pope Urban VIII issued a Bull\r\nagainst the astrologists, that is to say against those who undertook\r\nto produce calculations concerning the future of Christendom or of\r\nthe Roman Curia or in regard to the life of the pope. In 1732, the\r\nInquisition issued a prohibition of the reading of any books having to\r\ndo with fortune telling, the interpretation of dreams, or the art of\r\nnumbers. The books referred to under the latter designation were those\r\nthat undertook to prophesy the successful numbers for lotteries.\r\n\r\n\r\n=10. Poems, Facetiae, Text-books, Periodicals, and\r\nCyclopaedias.=--A number of works of no intrinsic importance,\r\nbelonging under the class of _facetiae_ and text-books, were\r\ncondemned during the 17th century on the ground of certain references,\r\ncharacterised as disrespectful, concerning Church matters. Certain\r\ntext-books also found their way into the list because they were\r\nreproducing the texts of classic authors who were classed by the\r\necclesiastics as obscene or immoral. The action of the authorities in\r\nregard to literature of this kind was curiously varied and it does not\r\nseem to be possible to find for it any consistent policy or principle.\r\nThe German satirical literature of this period appears to have escaped\r\nattention on the part of the examiners. The only German book of this\r\ncharacter prohibited during the latter part of the 17th century was the\r\n_Visiones de don Quevedo, die Wunderliche Satyrische und Warhafftige\r\nGeschichte Philanders v. Sittewald_, by Moscherosch, printed in\r\n1645 and prohibited in 1662. The next German work of this special\r\ncharacter to find place on the Index was Heine’s _Reisebilder_,\r\npublished a century and a half later. The prohibition of cyclopaedias\r\non the ground of objection to certain entries or references, proved of\r\nspecial inconvenience to Catholic students and instructors. The greater\r\npublishing activity of the Protestant communities and the keener\r\nscholarship of heretical editors had caused the production of works\r\nof reference of this kind to be much more considerable and important\r\nin the territories outside of those controlled by the Church. It not\r\ninfrequently happened that the condemnation of a work of this class\r\nleft the scholars of the Church without the use of any equivalent work.\r\nAs late even as Benedict XIV, the Congregation found occasion to add to\r\nthe list of prohibited cyclopaedias.\r\n\r\nThe English titles of the first half of the 18th century include\r\nthe _Tale of a Tub_ by Swift, _Pamela_ by Richardson, and _Robinson\r\nCrusoe_ by Defoe. The latter came to the attention of the indexers\r\nthrough a French edition printed in 1750 and prohibited in 1756. The\r\nFrench names of the same period include the _Contes et Nouvelles_\r\nof La Fontaine; the _Vie de Jacqueline, Comtesse de Hainaut_, of\r\nMlle. de La Roche-Guilhem, printed in 1702 and prohibited in 1727;\r\n_Lettres Historiques et Galantes de deux Dames de Condition_, by Mme.\r\nDunoyer, printed in 1704 in seven volumes, prohibited in 1725 and\r\nagain by Benedict in 1758; _Les Emportements Amoureux de la Religieuse\r\nÉtrangère_, printed anonymously in 1707, prohibited in Rome 1727, and\r\nin Spain in 1790. Molière escapes condemnation in Rome as well as in\r\nSpain. The _Don Quixote_, of Cervantes was marked by Sotomayor for\r\ncorrection but only in the case of a single sentence. The Lisbon Index\r\nof 1624 finds occasion for the cancellation in the same work of a\r\nnumber of paragraphs.\r\n\r\n\r\n=11. Secret Societies.=--Clement XII and Benedict XIV condemned,\r\nin Bulls issued in April, 1738, and March, 1751, the associations\r\nof _Libri Muratori_, or freemasons. The members of these societies\r\nwere rendered liable to the excommunication _latae sententiae_, and\r\nbishops and inquisitors were instructed to take measures against them\r\nas heretics. In September, 1821, Pius VII issued a similar Bull\r\nagainst the _Carbonari_. A Bull issued in March, 1825, by Leo XII\r\nrepeats the text of the three Bulls above specified and confirms their\r\ninstructions. In the Bull of Pius VII, is prohibited the possession\r\nor the reading of all catechisms of the _Carbonari_, of the minutes\r\nof their meetings, of their statutes and statements of purposes, and\r\nof all works written in their defence, whether these be in print\r\nor in manuscript. Through some oversight, this important general\r\nprohibition did not find its way into the Index. It is also the case\r\nthat but very few titles of works on freemasonry are included in the\r\nIndex lists after Clement XII. The Church seems to have relied, for\r\nthe suppression of this literature, on its general prohibitions. In\r\nMay, 1829, Pius VIII issued an encyclical condemning the teachings of\r\nthe freemasons and of kindred secret societies. Pius IX takes similar\r\nground in an encyclical of November, 1846, and in the allocution of\r\nSeptember, 1865. In April, 1884, Leo XIII devotes an encyclical to the\r\ninjurious teachings of the sect “_masonum_.” With this encyclical, is\r\nconnected an instruction of the Inquisition under which the faithful\r\nare forbidden to have any dealings with such societies. In January,\r\n1870, the Inquisition declared, in response (apparently) to some formal\r\napplication for instructions, that the Irish and American Fenians had\r\nplaced themselves under the general condemnation.[48]\r\n\r\nIn 1739, after the publication of the Bull of Clement XII, the\r\nInquisition prohibited the _Relation apologétique et historique de\r\nla société des Francs-Maçons_, by J. G. D., F. D., Dublin, 1738.\r\nIn the same year, Crudeli was imprisoned by the Inquisition on the\r\ncharge that he was a freemason, that he had ridiculed or scoffed at the\r\nMadonna of Saint Cresci, and that he had read prohibited books. He was\r\nsentenced to confinement for one year with the penance of praying from\r\nday to day the seven Penitential Psalms.\r\n\r\nIn 1789, the necromancer, Cagliostro, was imprisoned under the orders\r\nof the Inquisition. In April, 1791, the Inquisition issued a judgment\r\narrived at in a session at which the pope presided, declaring that\r\nCagliostro had fallen under the penalties adjudged by canon law, and\r\nalso by municipal law, against heretics, heresiarchs, astrologers,\r\nmagicians, and freemasons. The pope decided, as a special grace,\r\nto restrict the punishment to a life-long imprisonment, under the\r\ncondition however that he should abjure his heresies. Cagliostro died\r\nin prison in 1795. His collection of books and instruments was publicly\r\nburned. The destruction included a manuscript in which the Inquisition\r\nwas declared to have made the Christian religion superstitious,\r\ngodless, and degrading. A work of Cagliostro’s, apparently also left\r\nonly in the form of manuscript, bearing the title _Maçonnerie\r\nEgyptienne_, was in April, 1791, placed in the Index. The Spanish\r\nIndex of 1789 prohibits the _Mémoires Authentiques de Cagliostro_\r\nby Beam, published in Hamburg, in 1786.\r\n\r\nIn 1836, the Congregation prohibits various histories and treatises on\r\nfreemasonry published during the preceding three years in Paris and in\r\nBrussels. In 1820, was prohibited a treatise published in Madrid giving\r\nan account of the persecution of the freemasons under Clement XII and\r\nBenedict XIV. In 1846, was prohibited by the Inquisition a history of\r\nfreemasonry published anonymously in Madrid.\r\n\r\nIn 1880, the Congregation prohibited a treatise by Falcioni, _Coup\r\nd’oeil sur le Christianisme, par un Franc-Maçon, Disciple de la\r\nPhilosophie Positive_. Falcioni had been secretary of the Pontifical\r\nchapel. His book had been published in Paris in 1879.\r\n\r\n\r\n=12. Manuals for Exorcising.=--In 1604, was issued an edition of the\r\nRoman ritual containing a brief of Paul V, in which brief, bishops,\r\nabbots, and pastors are instructed to secure the exclusive use of this\r\nparticular ritual. There continued in use, nevertheless, a number of\r\nrituals varying to some extent from the text of this official Roman\r\nritual. There were also in use a number of companion volumes which\r\ncontained collections of blessings, forms of oaths, etc. In a decree\r\nof March, 1709, five exorcising manuals were prohibited which had been\r\nin print for more than a century with proper ecclesiastical approval\r\nand privilege. After the prohibition had been issued, it appeared\r\nthat a certain Daniel Francus had printed a collection of so-called\r\nscandalous passages taken from these books, and had then pointed out\r\nthat there was no prohibition in any of the Indexes of these passages\r\nor of the collections containing them, nor any instruction in any of\r\nthe Indexes for the expurgation of the books containing these passages.\r\nFrancus stated further that the worst of the five books, that bearing\r\nthe name of Hieronymus Mengus, had been printed in Frankfort, in\r\n1708, for the express purpose of bringing the Catholics to ridicule.\r\nDuring the following decade, a number of similar books of exorcising\r\nritual were prohibited and a decree of December, 1725, makes a general\r\nprohibition of all rituals printed after the Reformation without the\r\nspecific authorisation and approval of the Congregation of Rites. This\r\nprohibition includes a condemnation of all forms of exorcising and\r\neven of benedictions which had not secured such approval. The bishops\r\nare instructed to say that no such forms are permitted. As late as\r\n1832, the Congregation of Rites was asked to take into consideration a\r\ncollection of forms of absolution, benedictions, forms of exorcising,\r\netc., bearing the name Bern. Sannig, which had been first printed in\r\n1733 and had been in general use for a century. The Sannig collection\r\nwas declared to be prohibited under the general regulation above\r\nspecified. The work finds, however, no place in any of the Indexes\r\neither under the name of Sannig or under its own title. In the middle\r\nof the 18th century, were prohibited certain books for exorcising\r\nwhich had been in use among the faithful for a long series of years\r\nand which contained such formulas as the following: _Hel_, _Heloym_,\r\n_Heloa_, _Eheye_, _Totramaton_, _Adonay_, _Saday_, _Sabaoth_, _Sota_,\r\n_Emanuel_, _Alpha et Omega_, _Primus et Novissimus_, _Principimus\r\net Finis_, _Hagios_, _Ischyros_, _Ho Theos_, _Athanatos_, _Agla_,\r\n_Ichona_, _Homousion_, _Ya_, _Messias_, _Esereheye_, etc. Before each\r\nterm of ejaculation was to be made the sign of the cross. Capellis,\r\nin some treatise or manual for the use of exorcisms, explains that in\r\norder to ascertain whether or not the suspected person is certainly\r\nunder possession, this series of names should be written out on a\r\nstrip of consecrated paper and the paper should be placed somewhere\r\non the person of the patient without his knowledge. If the patient\r\nbecomes restless after the placing of the paper, it is evidence that\r\nhe is possessed. Capellis maintains stoutly that a test of this kind\r\nis not to be considered as superstitious. Mengus[49] gives a series\r\nof similar formulas with the same specification that before each\r\nutterance should be made the sign of the cross. Mengus also gives\r\nthe instruction for the burning of a picture or representation of the\r\ndemon through whom the patient is supposed to have become possessed.\r\nUpon the picture is to be written one of the several series of magic\r\nnames. In the fire in which the picture is to be placed should be cast,\r\nafter the imposition of a blessing, portions of sulphur, galbanus,\r\nassafoetida, aristolochia, hypericon, and ruta. Mengus gives further\r\na list of formulas for the blessing of oil which is to be bestowed\r\nupon the possessed person, both inwardly and outwardly; one of these\r\nformulas is ascribed to St. Cyprian. In regard to this particular\r\ngroup of publications, which, as stated, were in very extended use\r\namong the faithful, a use that in many cases at least was approved\r\nby their spiritual advisers, the censorship of the Church may be\r\nconsidered as having come into action rather late and with not too much\r\neffectiveness. In 1752, Benedict XIV publishes a new edition of the\r\nofficial Roman ritual. This contains but few new forms of benedictions.\r\nIn 1874, the Benedictine ritual was reprinted in Rome with a supplement\r\ncontaining forms of benedictions for railroads, telegraphs, springs,\r\nfoundries, and brick-yards, and also for the production of beer,\r\ncheese, butter, medicine, for the care of cattle, of horses, of birds,\r\nand of bees; in this appendix are also presented special forms of\r\nprayer against mice, grasshoppers, and other destructive creatures.\r\n\r\n\r\n=13. Fraudulent Indulgences.=--After 1603, prohibition was made,\r\nfirst by the Inquisition and the Congregation of the Index, and later\r\nby the Congregation of Indulgences, of a number of books, monographs,\r\nand sheets in which indulgences are recorded which either had never\r\nbeen granted or which had been garbled from their original text.\r\nMany of the false indulgences owe their existence to the general\r\nsuperstition and stupidity of the people, and it is to be noted that\r\nit has been necessary, from the beginning of the 17th century until\r\nthe present day, to continue to make disavowal of certain of the most\r\nfabulous and absurd of the series. Cardinal Baronius writes January\r\n20, 1601, to Antonio Talpa[50]: “Last evening I had occasion to apply\r\nto the Pope for a general indulgence. I found to my surprise that the\r\nPope had decided thereafter to give no general indulgences for a single\r\nperson or for a specific place. I praised him for this conclusion; for\r\nit is the case that many wrong uses have crept into the general use of\r\nindulgences. I have had occasion more than once to call the attention\r\nof the Congregations to these abuses and in so doing have had the\r\nsupport of many of the more thoughtful of my associates.”\r\n\r\nIn the _Decreta Generalia_ of Benedict XIV, there are four\r\nspecifications concerning indulgences. In the Index of Benedict are\r\nforbidden, under the term _compendio_, four Italian indulgence records,\r\nand under the term _indulgentiae_, eleven similar publications. Under\r\nthe term _sommario_, the entries include twelve Italian works, and\r\nunder the term _ablass_, one German issue. Indulgence publications\r\nare also recorded under such terms as: _diario_, _dovizie_, _folium_,\r\n_giornali_, _notizia_, and _orazioni_. The entries are also sometimes\r\nmade under the names of the publishers or editors, as, for instance,\r\nin the names of Dumensis and Lorenzo. It is the conclusion of Reusch,\r\nhowever, that but a very small proportion of the literature of this\r\nclass finds place in the Index. In the _Decreta Generalia_ (iii) are\r\nrecorded for instance all indulgences which had been issued before the\r\ndecree of Clement VIII of 1598, _de forma indulgentiarum pro corona,\r\ngrana seu calculi, cruces, et imagines sacrae_; all indulgences which\r\nhad been issued before the Bulls of Clement VIII in December, 1604,\r\nand of Paul V, May, 1605, and November, 1610, to orders, brotherhoods,\r\netc. As late as 1856, a decree of the Congregation of Indulgences was\r\ncommunicated to the bishops in which attention is called to a long\r\nseries of fraudulent indulgence announcements which had been issued\r\nin comparatively recent years in Italy, for the most part in Florence\r\nand which are ordered to be condemned. Of the false indulgences so\r\nspecified, is one credited to Pius V in which, in consideration of a\r\ncertain prayer, the beneficiary was to have as many indulgences as\r\nwould be equal “to the stars in the Heaven, the grains of sand in the\r\nsea, and the blades of grass in the fields”; another specification is\r\nthat of nine prayers in consideration of which Gregory (it is not clear\r\nwhich of the Gregories) and his successors, extend indulgences during a\r\nperiod of eighty thousand and a hundred and forty-nine years for each\r\nFriday, and for Good Friday eight additional indulgences; on a picture\r\nsomewhere in Poland is printed a prayer ascribed to the Madonna, spoken\r\nas she held in her arms the body of Christ. It is stated that to the\r\nbeliever uttering this prayer, Innocent XII had promised that he should\r\nbe able to save fifteen souls from the eternal fire or to convert\r\nfifteen sinners whose names he was to specify.\r\n\r\n\r\n=14. Works on the Saints and Pictures of the Saints.=--Under the\r\ndecrees of Urban VIII of 1625 and of 1634, it was forbidden to publish\r\nor to distribute writings concerning the lives and the miracles of\r\npersons classed as holy until such writings had secured the specific\r\nauthorisation of the Congregation or of the Inquisition. It was also\r\nforbidden to select for honour or worship as saints any persons not\r\nannounced as such by the authority of the Church; and, finally, it\r\nwas forbidden to place upon pictures of any persons not officially\r\nsaints the insignia of saintliness (_cum laureolis aut radiis sive\r\nsplendoribus_). In the _Decreta Gen._, iii, 1, production of such\r\nunauthorised pictures is forbidden. In the Index stand also, in\r\naddition to the prohibitions of writings concerning unauthorised or\r\nunofficial saints, works on the saints duly recognised as such, unless\r\nand until such works have been, page by page, examined and approved.\r\nSuch a prohibition became necessary in connection with the increasing\r\nmass of absurdly superstitious legends and stories which (in spite of\r\nthe watchfulness of authorities) continued to get into print and to\r\nsecure a wide circulation. The lives of Joseph and of Anna proved to be\r\na tempting subject for the writers of these stories.\r\n\r\nThe decrees of Urban VIII were in the beginning carried out with full\r\nthoroughness. Janus Nicius Erythraeus, writing in 1642,[51] says that\r\nhe had had in plan the publication of a life of Ancina of Saltuzzo, but\r\nthat the permission to print had been withheld because in his narrative\r\nhe had found occasion to record wonderful or miraculous things done\r\nby persons who had not been canonised. He had proposed to reshape his\r\nbiography, omitting the separate passages concerning persons other than\r\nthe bishop himself, but giving some fuller measure of consideration to\r\nthe virtues of Ancina; but even then had not been able to secure the\r\nauthority to print. He complains bitterly that writers are permitted\r\nto bring into print stories of shameful deeds and words of wicked men\r\nbut that the devout authors who desire to record for the elevation of\r\nthe faithful the virtues of pious men are discouraged. In 1648, the\r\nCongregation of Rites instructed the Archbishop of Naples to confiscate\r\na book presenting the life and the miracles of Ursula Benincasa\r\n(†1618), the founder of the Order of the Theatins. The author of the\r\nbook, Maria Maggio, a Theatin, was ordered to be brought to trial.\r\nUrsula is described on the title-page as _beata_ and as she had\r\nnot been canonised, this was apparently the main difficulty with the\r\nvolume. In the decree of 1625, it is stated that the prohibition of the\r\nuse of the term “saint” or “blessed” in connection with uncanonised\r\npersons is not in itself to be considered as any reflection on the\r\npiety or orthodoxy of such persons. It is also not to be considered\r\nas bringing into question persons who on the ground of the general\r\nconsensus of the faithful or from time immemorial, in the writings\r\nof the Church Fathers and of the earlier writers, or through the\r\npersonal knowledge extending over a series of years on the part of the\r\nlocal bishops, have been deservedly honoured. This reservation was\r\nnot unnaturally the cause of a series of controversies in regard to\r\nthe standing in the Church of holy persons who had secured what may\r\nbe called a local repute for saintliness but whose claims were not\r\nsufficiently assured to have obtained universal recognition.\r\n\r\n\r\n=15. Forms of Prayer.=--In 1626, Urban VIII confirmed the earlier\r\nprohibition of all breviaries or mass-books printed without the\r\napproval of the Congregation of Rites. The same prohibition was made\r\nto apply to unauthorised editions of the offices, of the litanies,\r\nor of the saints. The Index includes in addition to these general\r\nprohibitions the titles of a series of prayers mainly superstitious in\r\ntheir character. In the _Decreta Gen._, iv, 8, are prohibited all\r\nrosaries other than those which have been specifically authorised by\r\nthe Curia.\r\n\r\n\r\n=16. Mariology.=--In the _Decreta Gen._, ii, 4, are prohibited (in\r\n1617) all works in which the contention is maintained that Mary had\r\npartaken of any earthly sin. It is the conclusion of the Church that\r\nthose who maintain that Mary had any part in such sin are heretics\r\nand godless ones (_impii_). This prohibition stands in the Index of\r\nAlexander VII under the term _libri_. It is cited from a Bull of this\r\nPope issued in 1661. In 1617, Paul V caused the Inquisition to prohibit\r\nthe presentation in sermons, lectures, or theses of any suggestion\r\nconcerning the possible sinfulness of Mary. Paul takes pains to add,\r\nhowever, that his prohibition is not to be considered as undertaking\r\nitself to present a final conclusion on the question. It is the case\r\nthat the several Indexes include the titles of a long series of books\r\nin which the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception is defended. The\r\nground for the prohibition of books presenting this doctrine has been\r\nthe tendency to misapprehensions and misstatements in the form of\r\npresentation. It appears that the Dominicans, who have controlled the\r\npolicy of the Inquisition and largely that also of the Congregation\r\nof the Index, have had the chief responsibility for the condemnation\r\nof all doctrinal treatises which did not present precisely according\r\nto the Dominican theories the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception.\r\nA number of other works on Mariology are forbidden on the ground\r\nof exaggerations of statement, of bad taste in expression, and of\r\nconfusion in the analyses of doctrinal issues. Among the worst of\r\nthese is a treatise of Maria of Agreda and one by J. B. Poza. There are\r\nalso in the Index a group of writings condemned on the ground of their\r\nexaggeration of the worship of Mary.\r\n\r\nIn 1439, the Council of Basel decreed that the doctrine of the\r\nImmaculate Conception must be held by all orthodox Catholics. The\r\ndivines of the Sorbonne, in 1497, issued an order referring to the\r\nabove decree and instructing that each candidate for the doctorate\r\nmust be prepared to maintain this doctrine. The decree of the council\r\nwas naturally not confirmed in Rome, but in 1483, a Bull of Sixtus IV\r\ncondemned the contention that the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception\r\nis heretical and that the observance of the festival instituted under\r\nthis name is in itself sinful. At the same time, however, he prohibits\r\nthe declaring of the contrary doctrine as in itself heretical. In 1661,\r\na Bull of Alexander VII says, while confirming the approval given by\r\nhis predecessors to the doctrine, that it is not to be permitted to\r\ncharge with heresy or with mortal sin those who have not accepted\r\nthis doctrine, as the Church universal and the Holy Chair are not yet\r\nprepared to decide all the difficulties involved. In 1708, Clement\r\nXI declares that the festival of the Immaculate Conception is to be\r\nuniversally observed, but in the same year he orders to be confiscated\r\nand prohibited a reprint of the Bull in which this festival was first\r\ninstituted. Gregory VII was the first Pope who permitted the term\r\nImmaculate Conception to find place in the Book of the Mass and to have\r\nincluded in the Laurentian Litany the words _Regina sine labe originali\r\nconcepta_. In 1854, the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception is\r\nconfirmed by Pius IX as a dogma of the Church. Through some oversight,\r\nthe _Decretum Gen._, ii, 2, continued, however, to find place in\r\nthe Index that was published in 1854. In December, 1854, is printed\r\nin connection with the publication of the _Decreta_ a declaration\r\nin substance as follows: “As the dogma of Immaculate Conception has\r\nnow been authoritatively defined, works which treat of the same and\r\nwhich have in previous years been placed in the Index, are now to be\r\neliminated from the Index, unless it may be that certain of these works\r\nare entitled to condemnation on grounds other than their conclusions in\r\nregard to this doctrine.” It appears therefore that no prohibition now\r\nrests upon books, whether placed on the earlier Indexes or not, which\r\nmake defence of the doctrine.\r\n\r\nThe first important book written in defence of the doctrine of the\r\nImmaculate Conception which was formally condemned, was the work of the\r\nItalian Capucin, J. O. Maria Zamora, _De eminentissimae Deiparae V.\r\nM. perfectione_, published in Venice in 1629 and placed on the Index\r\nin 1636. The list of prohibitions of the works of this group during\r\nthe succeeding half-century is very considerable. I will note here but\r\none additional title, _Quatres Sonnets à l’honneur de la très-pure\r\net très-immaculée conception de la Vierge Marie_, by le Père Anne\r\nJoachim de Jésus-Marie.\r\n\r\nIn 1667, there came into controversy questions in regard to the bodily\r\nascension of Mary into heaven. These controversies brought into the\r\nIndex a number of treatises written on either side of the issue.\r\nBenedict XIV (in the decree _De Festis_, ii, 8, 18) says that the\r\nbodily assumption of Mary may be held as a pious and probable belief\r\nwhich it would be rash to contest; it is not, however, to be accepted\r\nformally as a dogma of the Church. The passages from the Scriptures\r\nwhich are cited to sustain the belief can be otherwise interpreted. The\r\ntext of the announcement proceeds: _Nec est ejusmodi traditio, quae\r\nsatis sit ad evehendam hanc sententiam ad gradum articulorum fidei_.\r\nReusch is of opinion that the tendency during the 19th century has been\r\nto develop this pious belief into a dogma. Dom. Arnaldi, in a treatise\r\nentitled _Super transitu B. M._, printed in Genoa in 1879, undertook\r\nto prove that Mary had never suffered death.[52] Several monographs,\r\nwritten in honour of the Madonna of Loreto, found their way into the\r\nIndex on the ground not of the substance of their teachings but of the\r\nextravagance of their language. In 1654, a work by Vincenzo Caraffa\r\n(later general of the Jesuits) was prohibited (with a _d.c._) which\r\nhad been published under a pseudonym in Naples and later reprinted in\r\nRome under the title _Camino del cielo overo prattiche spirituali,\r\ndel P. Luigi Sidereo_. The book was brought into the Index under the\r\ninstructions of the general of the Dominicans on the ground that it\r\nmaintained the theory of the Immaculate Conception. An examination of\r\nthe text showed that this was not the case, whereupon the following new\r\ngrounds for condemnation were presented: first, the author claims that\r\nthe Virgin during her sojourn in the temple had been fed by the angels\r\nwith heavenly nectar; second, the author says that the grace of Mary\r\nfrom the first moment of her life was greater than that of any created\r\nbeing; the author states with approval the opinion of Bernardino of\r\nSiena that Mary is to be worshipped as a goddess.\r\n\r\nScheeben points out[53] that, during these later years, the teaching\r\nof the Church holds that the power of the grace of Mary, at least\r\nafter the birth of Christ, must be held as being greater not only than\r\nthe heavenly grace given to the highest of mankind but even than that\r\npossessed by the highest among the angels. In 1700, was prohibited,\r\ntwenty-seven years after its publication, a volume by Zepherin de\r\nSomèire, a French Franciscan, printed in Narbonne under the title\r\nof _La dévotion à la mère de Dieu dans le très-saint Sacrement de\r\nl’autel, fondé sur les unions qui sont entre son fils et elle en ce\r\ndivin mystère_. The list of books on Mariology condemned in the\r\nIndexes is, as stated, very considerable, but the larger number of the\r\nmore important works treating upon different phases of the worship of\r\nMary escaped attention.\r\n\r\nIn 1854, under the authority of Pius IX, the belief in the Immaculate\r\nConception of Mary was elevated into a dogma. A number of treatises\r\nwritten against the new dogma were placed on the Index and the authors,\r\nin so far as they were ecclesiastics, were excommunicated. The list\r\nof these includes Thomas Braun of Germany, J. J. Laborde of France,\r\nBraulio Morgaez of Spain, and Grignani of Italy. A pastoral brief on\r\nthe subject, signed by the three bishops of the Church of Utrecht,\r\nwas prohibited by the Inquisition. A German treatise by H. Oswald,\r\nprofessor at Paderborn, was condemned on the ground of extravagance of\r\nutterance in defence of the dogma.\r\n\r\n\r\n=17. Revelations by Nuns.=--For a long series of visions and of\r\nso-called revelations the imagination of the nuns is responsible. Many\r\nof these revelations from the convents have called for the attention\r\nof the Roman censors, but the writer whose productions received the\r\nlargest measure of consideration was Maria of Agreda (†1665). Her\r\nmonograph on the mystical nature of God, first printed in 1670, was\r\ncondemned by the Inquisition in 1681. The prohibition was, however,\r\nsuspended by Innocent XI at the instance of the court of Spain. Up to\r\nthe close of the century, there continued to be conflicting utterances\r\nand instructions in regard to the book. The judgment of the Inquisition\r\nwas neither formally published nor recalled, and there was therefore\r\ncontinued question as to whether or not the book of Agreda belonged\r\nto the list of prohibited works. The title never found place in the\r\nIndex, while a number of editions of the volume were actually issued\r\nwith the privilege and approval of the Church authorities. Towards the\r\nend of the 17th century, there came into the Index titles of a number\r\nof writings of a similar character by another Spanish nun, Hippolyta\r\nRocaberti, and the Index of Benedict contains a prohibition of another\r\nthesis of the same general character by the nun Clarissa, which had\r\nbeen printed in Munich.\r\n\r\n\r\n=18. Controversies concerning the Chinese and Malabar Usages.=--Under\r\nClement XI, was decided, adversely to the contentions of the Jesuits,\r\nthrough a decree of the Inquisition in 1710 and a Bull of 1715,\r\nan issue that had continued during a series of years between the\r\nmissionaries of the Jesuits and those of the rival Orders, concerning\r\nthe propriety of permitting the Chinese converts to retain certain\r\nspecial usages. The Inquisition prohibited the publication, unless\r\nwith the special authorisation of the pope, of all writings which were\r\nconcerned with these Chinese usages or with the controversies that had\r\narisen concerning them. This prohibition was entered by Benedict XIV\r\nin the _Decreta Gen._, iv, 6, and, in 1722, the division of the great\r\nhistory of the Jesuits by Juvencius, which treated of this matter,\r\nwas condemned separately. This action aroused fresh controversies\r\nand, in 1742, Benedict found occasion for a further Bull devoted to\r\nthem. In 1744, another Bull was issued, in which decision was given in\r\nan analogous issue that had arisen with the Malabars; and, in 1745,\r\nBenedict caused the Inquisition to prohibit, on the ground of some\r\nantagonistic opinions expressed in it in regard to this decision, a\r\ncomprehensive history by the Capucin Norbert. The two controversies\r\ncontinued during a long term of years and produced a mass of\r\ncontroversial publications, but few separate titles of these writings\r\ncame into the Index; the See appears to have considered the general\r\nprohibitions above specified sufficient to meet the requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n=19. Fraudulent Literature.=--In the _Decreta Gen._, ii, 10,\r\nare prohibited all books, pamphlets, criticisms, and commentaries,\r\nwhether written or printed, which had to do with certain lead tablets\r\n(_Laminae plumbeae_) which had been dug up in Granada and which\r\nbore ancient Arabic characters; with these were condemned certain\r\nmanuscripts which had been unearthed in the foundations of an old\r\ntower in Granada. The condemnation covers also works not devoted to\r\nthis subject-matter but in which references are made to said tablets\r\nor writings, until and unless such references have been eliminated.\r\nThe fragments of tablets and of manuscripts, which, according to their\r\ntext, had been inscribed in the time of the Apostles, were discovered\r\nbetween the years 1588 and 1597; but it was not until 1682 that they\r\nwere officially pronounced by the authorities in Rome to be fraudulent.\r\nThe false monographs of Flavius Lucius Dexter which belonged to the\r\nsame group of manufactured documents, were never forbidden either in\r\nRome or in Spain. Of the long series of treatises written concerning\r\nthe letter said to have been addressed by the Madonna to the residents\r\nof Messina, two only have come into the Index.\r\n\r\nIn the _Decreta Gen._, ii, 8, are forbidden all books, codexes,\r\nand sheets, whether printed or written, which had to do with the\r\nvisions and utterances, the alleged saintliness, etc., of the\r\nAnchorite Johannes Cala; later, were also forbidden all pictures or\r\nrepresentations presenting Cala as a saint. This prohibition has to do\r\nwith an alleged discovery made in 1660, by one of the ecclesiastics in\r\nNaples, of Johannes Cala as a saint of the 12th century. Cala secured\r\nsaintly honour for a term of twenty years but his saintliness was\r\nfinally discredited in 1680.\r\n\r\n\r\n=20. Works on Quietism.=--In 1680, the Jesuit Segneri brought\r\nto the consideration of the Index authorities two ascetic writings\r\nof the Spaniard Molinos, on the ground that they were maintaining,\r\nunder the doctrinal name of Quietism, a fraudulent holiness. In 1685,\r\nthe Inquisition of Rome initiated proceedings against Molinos on the\r\nground both of his life and of his instruction. He was condemned\r\nto imprisonment for life, and, under a special Bull of Innocent XI\r\nconfirming a decree of the Inquisition, his doctrine was condemned,\r\nand all of his writings, whether printed or written, were prohibited.\r\nShortly thereafter, the Inquisition prohibited also the ascetic\r\nwritings of the friend of Molinos, the Cardinal Petrucci, together with\r\ncertain French writings presenting similar doctrine. Among the latter\r\nwere works by Mallavel, Boudon, Lacombe and Madame Guyon. Towards the\r\nclose of the 17th century, the Inquisition found occasion to condemn\r\na long series of ascetic writings including a number which had been\r\npublished many years back, but which had apparently only at that time\r\nbeen brought to the attention of the examiners. Some of these books\r\nhad been printed in Rome and had been distributed for many years\r\nwithout check. In this group may be mentioned the works of Falconi,\r\nCanfeld, Bernières-Louvigny, etc. As early as 1675, the Inquisition had\r\nprohibited the _Opera omnia_ of the Italian writer Lambardi, who\r\nis described as in his doctrinal views a predecessor of Molinos.\r\n\r\n\r\n=21. Fénelon.=--In 1697, Fénelon, who had with Bossuet interested\r\nhimself some years earlier in the protection of Madame Guyon, published\r\nhis volume on the Saints and the Inner Life. The doctrines therein\r\npresented on contemplation as distinguished from meditation, and in\r\nregard to the pure and unselfish love of God, which, as he contended,\r\ncaused to be put to one side selfishness and the demand for individual\r\nsalvation, were sharply criticised by Bossuet and other of his fellow\r\nbishops. The volume was by Fénelon himself forwarded to Rome for a\r\ndecision as to its orthodoxy. Louis XIV demanded from Innocent XII, in\r\nJuly, 1697, the condemnation of the book. It was placed for examination\r\nin the hands of the censorship committee of the Inquisition. The\r\nreports of the representatives who had been sent to Rome in regard\r\nto the business, represented that the votes of the Inquisitors would\r\nhave decided in favour of Fénelon’s treatise if it had not been for\r\nthe requirement of Louis XIV. In a brief of March, 1699, the book was\r\nprohibited under the penalty of excommunication, and twenty-three\r\npropositions cited from it were specifically censured. In this brief,\r\npains had been taken to avoid the use of any expressions which would\r\nbe likely to cause annoyance in France and in fact no reference was\r\nmade in it to the Inquisition. The brief was confirmed by the French\r\nChurch and was formally published, and Fénelon submitted himself to the\r\njudgment. The earlier prohibition of the writings of Lacombe and Madame\r\nGuyon (the opinions in which were substantially at one with those\r\npresented by Fénelon) appears hardly to have become known in France,\r\nwhere it certainly never was acted upon. Fénelon’s correspondence from\r\nRome states that the influence of the Jesuits there had been exercised\r\nin his favour. The Jesuits were, at the moment, in connection with some\r\nconditions in China, in opposition to the Pope and were willing on\r\nthis ground to support the contentions even of a Jansenist. Chanterac,\r\nwho was Fénelon’s representative in Rome, suggested to the bishop\r\nthat ground could be found for denouncing before the Inquisition the\r\nwritings of his opponent Bossuet, but Fénelon appears to have been\r\nunwilling to have any such matter brought into question in connection\r\nwith the pending issue. The brief of the Pope was published in France\r\nunder the direct authority of the King by means of letters patent. The\r\nMaxims of Fénelon (in which had been found the larger number of the\r\npropositions condemned) were never placed in the Spanish Index. An\r\nedition of the _Télémaque_ which had been printed in London was,\r\nhowever, under an edict of 1771, expurgated before being authorised for\r\ncirculation in Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\n=22. Contest concerning the Doctrine of Probability.=--During\r\nthe rule of Benedict XIV, a sharp controversy arose between the\r\nDominicans and the Jesuits in regard to the doctrine of Probability,\r\nthe immediate cause being the publication of a treatise on morality\r\nby the Jesuit Benzi, which is described as “shameless.” The leading\r\nrepresentative of the Dominicans was Concina (1687–1756), and of\r\nthe Jesuits, Faure (1702–1779). Benedict XIV brought into his Index\r\ncertain of the monographs by both authors, but the principal treatise\r\nof Concina, sharply condemned by the Jesuits, was not prohibited.\r\nBenedict took occasion, however, to instruct Concina to publish, over\r\nhis signature, a comprehensive explanation of his treatise. Clement\r\nXIII prohibited the sermons of the German Jesuit, Neumayr, and, at the\r\nsame time, a biography of Concina. Concina’s teachings against the\r\ndoctrine of Probability were continued and developed by his associate\r\nPatuzzi (1700–1769). Patuzzi was replied to by Liguori (1696–1787),\r\nfounder, in 1732, of the Congregation of the Redemptorists. Benedict\r\nXIV appears to have given his official acceptance to the doctrine of\r\nProbability as expounded by Liguori, the later edition of his treatise\r\nhaving been issued with a specific approval from the Pope. This\r\napproval secured, later, confirmation on the part of the Church as a\r\nwhole, as, in 1839, Concina secured canonisation, and, in 1871, his\r\nname was included in the list of doctors of the Church, being, through\r\nthis act, associated with St. Athanasius, St. Augustine, St. Bernard,\r\nSt. Thomas, and other pillars of the Church. After the giving of this\r\nhonour, the Jesuits, under the lead of Ballerini, took the ground that\r\ncertain of the conclusions of Liguori had been too rigorous and that\r\nthe doctrine termed by him _Regni probabilismus_ must in order to\r\nbe maintained, be interpreted in the sense of “ordinary probability.”\r\nThe Jesuits came in this contention into controversy with the\r\nRedemptorists, who insisted upon the distinctive importance of the\r\ndifferentiation expressed by their founder. The treatise of Ballerini\r\nwas however reprinted in Rome with a special privilege from the master\r\nof the palace.\r\n\r\n\r\n=23. The Controversy concerning Usury, 1600–1800.=--In a long\r\nseries of decrees from popes and from councils, the Church has\r\nannounced its conclusion that the taking of interest, even although\r\nthe rate should not be extortionate, comes under the head of the sin\r\nof usury. This contention was maintained constantly throughout the\r\n17th and 18th centuries, and the several classes of trade in which the\r\ntaking of interest was a necessary factor, were condemned as not to\r\nbe permitted by the Church. As a result of this policy, a number of\r\nlegal treatises which undertook the defence of interest that was not\r\nexaggerated into extortion, were prohibited. There were also placed\r\nupon the Index certain other monographs in which the question had\r\nbeen treated from a purely academic standpoint. Under Benedict XIV,\r\nthe controversy came to the front in connection with the publication\r\nof monographs by Broedersen, an ecclesiastic of Utrecht, and by the\r\nMarquis Sipio Maffei, in which ground was taken against the theories of\r\nthe Church. Benedict XIV published, in 1745, an encyclical in which he\r\nconfirms as the present utterance of the Church the old contention. The\r\ntwo treatises which had formed the text for the utterance of the Pope\r\nwere, however, not prohibited. In fact that by Maffei was, in 1746,\r\nreprinted in Rome contemporaneously with a monograph by the Dominican\r\nConcina, in which Maffei’s conclusions were stigmatised as heretical.\r\nIt is the conclusion of Reusch that the earlier Church view, while\r\nin theory confirmed by Benedict, had practically been abandoned. The\r\ncontroversy continued throughout the 19th century, and several of the\r\nlater popes have taken the ground that the practice of taking interest\r\nthat was not extortionate could be permitted until the question had\r\nreceived a final decision from the Holy See. During this latter period,\r\nonly one work on the subject was placed on the Index, a monograph by\r\nLaborde, who was a sharp opponent of the earlier Church theory. No\r\nfinal conclusion of the issue has, however, ever been reached by the\r\nChurch. It has probably been withheld because it would be difficult\r\nto frame a conclusion that would not either directly or indirectly\r\nconstitute a reflection on the good judgment and wisdom of the earlier\r\npapal utterances.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1745, Benedict XIV instituted a special Congregation\r\ncomprising four cardinals and clever theologians to give consideration\r\nto the subject of usury. The theologians included two Jesuits, one\r\nDominican (Concina), and one Observant. The Pope himself presided over\r\nthe sessions. The conclusions arrived at were published on the first\r\nof August in the form of three propositions. These were utilised by\r\nBenedict as the basis of the encyclical to the Italian bishops issued\r\nin November, 1745.\r\n\r\n1. All return for the use of money given in the form of interest is to\r\nbe classed as usury and characterised as unlawful.\r\n\r\n2. One may not say that it is unlawful only to receive extortionate\r\ninterest or to take interest from the poor.\r\n\r\n3. It may be permitted for the lender to receive some return or\r\ncompensation for his service from some person other than the borrower\r\nor person benefited; but it may not be permitted to make provision that\r\nsuch second person or guarantor should always be at hand.\r\n\r\nIn 1746, the year following the publication of the encyclical, Maffei\r\nhad published a second edition of his treatise, which bears the imprint\r\nof the master of the palace. In a letter printed in this edition,\r\nMaffei writes that he had not as yet learned what had been the precise\r\nsubject of condemnation in the encyclical. He was, however, of the\r\nopinion that he had been able in his treatise to anticipate the\r\ndoctrine of the encyclical.\r\n\r\nIn the same year, Concina brought into print three essays in which he\r\nmakes sharp criticism of the heresies of Broedersen and Maffei. These\r\nessays are dedicated to the pope. Muratori, writing in February, 1747,\r\nsays: “A curious history is this! The Holy Father accepts dedication on\r\nthe one hand from Concina and on the other from Maffei and yet neither\r\nthe one nor the other is to be classed as unsound or heretical.”\r\n\r\nAfter 1820, there arose also in France an active controversy on the\r\nquestion of interest. The earlier orthodox opinion adverse to the use\r\nof interest was maintained by Abbé Pages in his treatise _Dissertation\r\nsur le prêt à intérêt_, published in 1821. The contrary view was\r\nmaintained by La Luzerne, Bishop of Langres, in his _Dissertations sur\r\nle Prêt de Commerce_, published in 1823 in five volumes, and by the\r\nAbbé Baronnat in _Le Prétendu Mystère de l’Usure Dévoilé_, published\r\nin 1822. In the course of the following half-century, the question was\r\nrepeatedly brought from France and from Italy to the attention of the\r\nInquisition. In 1873, the Congregation of Propaganda printed together\r\nthe decisions that had been issued by the Inquisition on this subject\r\nbetween 1780 and 1872. The conclusion presented in 1873 is in substance\r\nas follows: Those who, under the authority of the law of the land, may\r\ntake interest at a moderate rate (up to five per cent.), whether laymen\r\nor ecclesiastics, are not to be called to account in the confessional\r\nor otherwise for so doing until it has seemed wise to the Holy See to\r\npresent a final conclusion in the matter. They must, however, hold\r\nthemselves prepared at any time to accept and to abide by the final\r\ninstruction of the Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n=24. Philosophical Writings, between 1750 and 1800, Condemned as\r\nIrreligious.=--In the Spanish Index, are prohibited all the writings\r\nof Voltaire and Rousseau. The Roman Index of 1824 includes the name of\r\nDavid Hume.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1778, Pius VI issues a general prohibition as follows:\r\n_Libri omnes incredulorum, sive anonymi sive contra, in quibus contra\r\nreligionem agitur_. This prohibition, instead of being included in the\r\n_Decreta Generalia_, where similar decrees had heretofore been printed,\r\nis placed under the term _libri_. Connected with the decree, is the\r\nspecification that the permission to read books of this class can be\r\ngranted only by the pope himself. It is probable that this general\r\nprohibition did not prove particularly effective, as it was hardly\r\npossible for the average reader to be able at once to identify a work\r\nas irreligious in tendency or to have knowledge by name of all of the\r\nwriters who were to be classed as unbelievers. The difficulty was\r\nnaturally greater in the case of anonymous works.\r\n\r\nIn the Spanish Indexes of 1747 and 1790, the editors have indicated by\r\na mark the books the reading of which is prohibited even to those who\r\nhave secured permission for the use of works included in the general\r\nIndex lists.\r\n\r\nThere was published in Paris an encyclopaedia under the title\r\n_l’Encyclopédie ou Dictionnaire raisonnée des Sciences, des Arts,\r\net des Métiers, par la Société des Gens de Lettres_. It bore the\r\nnames, as editors, of Diderot and d’Alembert. In 1759, at the time of\r\nthe prohibition, seven volumes only had been published. The first two\r\nvolumes, printed in 1751, had been condemned in 1752, under an order\r\nof the Council of the King; but two years later, the king issued a\r\nprivilege for the continuation of the work. The papal brief states that\r\nthe volumes first issued had been condemned and that the later issues,\r\ndescribed as a revised edition, had been carefully examined by the\r\nInquisition and again condemned on the ground that the teachings and\r\npropositions contained in them were false and pernicious and tended\r\nto the destruction of morality; and further that these teachings\r\npromoted godlessness and the undermining of religion. In 1759, the\r\nroyal privilege under which the publication was being continued, was\r\nwithdrawn. The editors and printers succeeded, however, in carrying on\r\nthe work without coming into open conflict with the authorities, and by\r\n1772, twenty-eight volumes had come into print.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1757, a decree of Louis XV prohibits, under penalty of death,\r\nthe production and distribution of any writings against religion. There\r\ndoes not appear, however, to be on record any instance of the carrying\r\nout of this penalty.\r\n\r\nThe papal brief issued in 1759 in regard to the treatise of Helvétius,\r\n_De l’Esprit_, describes the book as “antagonistic to the\r\nChristian religion and to natural morality, and as maintaining\r\nthe pernicious and damnable views of the Materialists and of the\r\nEpicureans,” and further, “as maintaining many godless and heretical\r\npropositions.”\r\n\r\nIn 1762, a prohibition of the Inquisition contains the title of\r\n_La petite Encyclopédie ou Dictionnaire des Philosophes, oeuvre\r\nposthume d’un de ces Messieurs_. The entry is followed by the remark\r\n“_Ridiculum acri fortius et malius plerumque secat res_. Anvers,\r\n1761.” This title probably refers to a reprint of some portions of the\r\nencyclopaedia. Between 1758 and 1800, were placed upon the Index at\r\nintervals practically all of the works of Voltaire, but, excepting in\r\nSpanish Indexes, the term _Opera omnia_ does not appear. In 1762, the\r\ntreatise by Rousseau on education, entitled _Émile_, was prohibited\r\nby the Inquisition; and in the same year, the book was ordered by the\r\nParliament of Paris to be burned. It was also censured by the Sorbonne\r\nand prohibited for France by the Archbishop of Paris. The work was also\r\ncondemned by the Protestant authorities in Geneva.\r\n\r\nIn 1784, was prohibited, by a brief of Pius VI, a work issued under the\r\ntitle of _Recherches Philosophiques sur les Américains ou Mémoires\r\nintéressants pour servir a l’Histoire de l’Humanité_. The author was\r\nCornelius de Paw, a canon in Zante.\r\n\r\nIn 1761, the Congregation prohibits the French version of the essay\r\nby David Hume, _A Treatise on the Human Understanding_. This\r\nedition had been printed in Amsterdam in 1758, twenty years after the\r\nappearance of the original.\r\n\r\nGibbon’s _Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_, printed in an\r\nItalian edition in 1776, was prohibited in 1783. The writings of\r\nThomas Paine and Joseph Priestly escaped the attention of the compilers\r\nof the Roman Index, but the name of the latter author appears in the\r\nSpanish Index of 1806.\r\n\r\nThe writings of Frederick the Great of Prussia, as printed in Berlin,\r\nin 1750, under the title of _Oeuvres du Philosophe de Sans-Souci_,\r\nreceive the compliment of prohibition by the Inquisition in 1760. The\r\nSpanish Index does not include the works but does find place for the\r\n_Mémoires pour servir à l’Histoire de la Maison de Brandebourg_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=25. Works on Philosophy and Natural Science, 1800–1880.=--Among\r\nthe works prohibited during the period in question in the department of\r\nphilosophy and natural science, may be noted the following:\r\n\r\nVilliers, Ch. de, _A Treatise on Kant_, printed in Paris in 1801,\r\nprohibited in 1817. An Italian edition of Kant’s _Critique of Pure\r\nReason_, printed (in Rome) in 1821, prohibited in the same year.\r\n\r\nBuhle, J. G., _Geschichte der neuern Philosophie_, printed in Leipsic,\r\n1800–1805, prohibited (in the French and Italian versions) in 1828.\r\n\r\nTennemann, _Grundriss der Gesch. der Philosophie_, printed in Leipsic\r\nin 1812, prohibited (in the Italian version) in 1837, prohibited again\r\n(in a Polish version) in 1865.\r\n\r\nBentham, Jeremy. Of this author practically all the works find place\r\nsooner or later in the Index, but the term _Opera omnia_ has not\r\nbeen used.\r\n\r\nWhately, Richard, _Elements of Logic_, printed in 1822, prohibited\r\nin 1851.\r\n\r\nMill, John Stuart, _Treatise on Liberty_, prohibited in 1851;\r\n_Principles of Political Economy_, printed in 1848, prohibited in\r\n1850.\r\n\r\nDarwin, Erasmus, _Zoönomy_, printed in 1794, prohibited in 1817.\r\n(_The Origin of Species_ and the other treatises by Charles\r\nDarwin, the grandson of Erasmus, have, curiously enough, escaped the\r\nattention of the Index authorities.)\r\n\r\nDraper, J. W., _History of the Conflict between Religion and\r\nScience_, printed (in New York) in 1874, prohibited (in a Spanish\r\nversion) in 1876.\r\n\r\nCondorcet, the Marquis, _Esquisse d’un Tableau historique du Progrès\r\nde l’Esprit humain_, printed in 1804 as a division in a series of\r\nworks comprising in all twenty-one volumes, prohibited 1827.\r\n\r\nCondillac, Abbé de, _Cours d’Étude_, printed (in Paris) in 1773,\r\nprohibited in 1836.\r\n\r\nAhrens, Henri, _Cours du Droit Naturel_, printed in 1838,\r\nprohibited 1868.\r\n\r\nCousin, _Cours d’Histoire de la Philosophie_, printed in 1827,\r\nprohibited in 1844. This is the only one of the long series of works by\r\nthis author that finds place in the Index. Cousin was induced by his\r\nfriends Sibour and Maret, for the purpose of preventing the threatened\r\ncondemnation of his works by the Congregation of the Index, to write\r\na letter to the Pope. He writes, under date of April 30, 1836, in\r\nsubstance as follows: “As Your Holiness has already been informed, I\r\nam myself a devout upholder of the Christian faith and I place all my\r\nhopes for the future of mankind upon the maintenance and extension of\r\nChristianity. I can but be troubled that my views have been placed in\r\na false light and I have attempted to produce a philosophical treatise\r\nwhich should be entirely free from the possibility of reproach and\r\nin the preparation of which I have secured the counsel of scholarly\r\ndivines. If it may be the case that, notwithstanding my own watchful\r\ncare and the aid of these scholarly advisers, certain passages which\r\ncould cause concern to Your Holiness have escaped attention, I will ask\r\nthat these may be indicated to me. I am more than anxious to correct\r\nor to eliminate any expressions or statements that may be open to\r\ncriticism from the point of view of the Church. My sole purpose is to\r\ndo all that may be practicable to perfect the text of these modest\r\nwritings of mine.”\r\n\r\nComte, Auguste (†1857), _Cours de Philosophie Positive_, printed\r\nin Paris in 1864 with an introduction by Littré, prohibited in the\r\nsame year. No one of the other works by Comte finds place in the\r\nIndex. Littré had sharp controversies with Dupanloup in 1863, and was\r\ncharacterised by the Archbishop as an atheist, but no one of Littré’s\r\nwritings was formally condemned.\r\n\r\nTaine, Hippolyte Adolphe, _Histoire de la Littérature Anglaise_,\r\nprinted (in Paris) in 1863, prohibited in 1866. This work had, in 1864,\r\nbeen condemned by the French Academy as tending to undermine the belief\r\nin the freedom of the will, the sense of personal responsibility, and\r\nmorality in general.\r\n\r\nLegrand, Jacques, _Recherche des Bases d’une Philosophie Pratique_,\r\nprinted in 1864, prohibited the same year.\r\n\r\nMangin, Arthur, _L’Homme et la Bête_, printed in 1872, prohibited the\r\nsame year.\r\n\r\nFiguier, Louis, _Le Lendemain de la Mort ou la Vie Future selon la\r\nScience_, printed 1871, prohibited 1872.\r\n\r\nA collection of essays by Tyndall, Owen, Huxley, Hooker, and Lubbock,\r\ntranslated into French, together with certain papers by Raymond,\r\nedited by the Abbé Moigno, on the general subject-matter of science\r\nand faith, was printed in Paris in 1875 and prohibited in the same\r\nyear. Connected with the prohibition is a statement that the notes of\r\nMoigno on Tyndall and the other naturalists meet the approval of the\r\nCongregation.\r\n\r\nLeopardi, Giacomo, _Operetti Morali_, printed 1827, prohibited, with a\r\n_donec emendatum_, in 1850.\r\n\r\nSpaventa, Bernardo, _Opera omnia_, printed between the years 1861 and\r\n1874.\r\n\r\nVera, Auguste, _Opera omnia_ in each and every version. These two\r\nwriters had given instruction in the Hegelian philosophy. Vera’s works\r\nhad appeared in Italian, French, and English editions.\r\n\r\nFerrari, Gius., _Opera omnia_, prohibited 1877. The chief work of\r\nthis author, _Essai sur le Principe et la Limite de la Philosophie\r\nd’Histoire_, had been printed as early as 1837 and had for forty\r\nyears escaped condemnation.\r\n\r\nSettembrini, Luigi (a third Neapolitan Hegelian), _Lezioni di\r\nLetteratura Italiana_, printed in 1868, prohibited in 1874.\r\n\r\nSicilinoni, Pietro (professor of philosophy in Bologna), a series of\r\nworks printed between the years 1878 and 1887, placed upon the Index\r\nfrom year to year immediately after their publication.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Historical Works]\r\n\r\nRanke, L., _Die Römischen Päpste, ihre Kirche und ihr Staat, im\r\nXVI^{ten} und XVII^{ten} Jahrhundert_, printed in 1835, prohibited\r\nin 1841.\r\n\r\nHume, David, _History of England_, printed in 1761, prohibited in\r\n1823.\r\n\r\nRobertson, William, _History of Charles the Fifth_, printed in 1762,\r\nprohibited (in a French edition) in 1777.\r\n\r\nGoldsmith, Oliver, _History of England_, printed in 1770, prohibited\r\n(in an Italian edition), with a _d.c._, 1823.\r\n\r\nRoscoe, William, _Biography of Leo X_, printed 1805, prohibited,\r\nin both the English and Italian versions, in 1825.\r\n\r\nHallam, Henry, _View of the State of Europe during the Middle\r\nAges_, printed in 1818, prohibited (in the Italian edition) in 1833.\r\n_Constitutional History of England_, printed in 1824, prohibited\r\n1827.\r\n\r\nBeugnot, A., _Histoire de la Destruction du Paganisme en Occident_,\r\nprinted in 1835, prohibited in 1837.\r\n\r\nSismondi, J. C. L. S. de, _Histoire du Moyen-Age_, printed in\r\n1812, prohibited in 1817. The prohibition covers, however, only\r\nthe first eleven volumes. The sixteenth volume, which contains the\r\nnoteworthy chapter on the pernicious effects produced on Italy by the\r\ncasuistical morality of the Church of Rome, escaped condemnation.\r\n\r\nGregorovius, _Geschichte der Stadt Rom im Mittelalter_, printed in\r\n1859–1873, condemned in 1874, both in the German original and in the\r\nItalian version.\r\n\r\nMignet, F. A., _Histoire de la Révolution Française_, printed in 1824,\r\nprohibited 1825.\r\n\r\nSégur, Comte de, _Galerie Morale et Politique_, printed in 1817–1823,\r\nprohibited 1826.\r\n\r\nJobez, Alph., _La France sous Louis XV_, printed 1865–1867, prohibited\r\n1868.\r\n\r\nLe Bas, Phil., _L’Univers Pittoresque_, printed in 1851, prohibited in\r\n1853. The reprehensible chapters in this descriptive work were those\r\ngiving an account of the religions of the world.\r\n\r\nMunks, _La Palestine, Description géographique, historique, et\r\narchéologique_, printed 1845, prohibited in 1853.\r\n\r\n_Dictionnaire Encyclopédique de la France_, edited by Le Bas and\r\nRénier, printed, in twelve volumes, 1840–1845, prohibited (in a\r\nseparate decree) in 1853.\r\n\r\nThe prohibitions of this period include a long series of French,\r\nGerman, and Italian encyclopaedias, universal dictionaries, gazetteers,\r\netc., in addition to those specified.\r\n\r\nLalande, J. L. de, _Voyage en Italie_, printed in 1769, prohibited in\r\n1820. It is possible that one reason for placing on the Index, so many\r\nyears after the date of its appearance, this particular book was the\r\nassociation at a later date by the author with the _Dictionnaire des\r\nAthées_ which was compiled by Maréchal. This latter work, however,\r\ncuriously escapes the attention of the Index compilers.\r\n\r\nDidier, Ch., _Rome souterraine_, printed in 1833, prohibited in\r\n1835. It is proper to point out that this work has to do, not with the\r\nCatacombs, but with the secret societies of Rome.\r\n\r\nViardot, Louis, _Les Musées d’Italie_, printed in 1842, prohibited\r\nin 1865. A later work by this author on the Jesuits, the bishops, and\r\nthe pope, apparently much more serious in its subject-matter, escapes\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nCiocci, Raffaelle, _A Narrative of Iniquities and Barbarities practised\r\nat Rome in the 19th Century_, printed (in a French version) in 1841,\r\nprohibited in 1845. The author was formerly a Cistercian and had been\r\nlibrarian of the papal College of San Bernardo. It is not surprising\r\nthat his work failed to secure the approval of the Roman authorities.\r\n\r\nLa Châtre, Maurice, _Histoire des Papes; Les Crimes, Meurtres ... des\r\nPontifes Romains, depuis S. Pierre jusqu’ à Gregoire XVI_, printed\r\nin 1842–1845, prohibited in 1848.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General Literature]\r\n\r\nAmong the noteworthy works under the heading of general literature may\r\nbe cited the following:\r\n\r\nSue, Eugene, _Mystères de Paris_, printed in 1843, prohibited in\r\n1852; _Le Juif Errant_, printed in 1845, prohibited in 1852. Later in\r\nthe same year, Sue’s name was placed upon the Index connected with\r\nthe term _Opera omnia_. In 1864, the list of French authors all of\r\nwhose works were prohibited includes the following names: Balzac,\r\nChampfleury, Dumas the elder and Dumas the younger, Feydeau, Murger,\r\nSand, Soulié, and Stendhal. The name of Flaubert appears in the same\r\nyear in connection with two only of his romances. The volume of the\r\nAbbé Michon, published anonymously under the title _Le Maudit_,\r\nwas prohibited in the year of its publication, 1864, and the later\r\nvolumes issued as by the author of _Le Maudit_ were prohibited as\r\nthey appeared. Since 1864, the compilers of the Index have given\r\ncomparatively little attention to French fiction.\r\n\r\nIn 1834, the _Chansons_ of Béranger were prohibited. Some of these\r\nhad been printed as far back as 1815. Additional titles from French\r\nliterature are as follows:\r\n\r\nLamartine, Alph. de, _Souvenirs d’un Voyage en Orient_, printed in\r\n1835, prohibited in 1836.\r\n\r\nHugo, Victor, _Notre Dame de Paris_, printed in 1831, prohibited\r\nin 1834; _Les Misérables_, printed in 1836, prohibited in 1864.\r\n\r\nThe famous volumes by Ferd. Fabre, _Lucifer_ and _L’Abbé Grand_,\r\ncuriously enough escape condemnation.\r\n\r\nThe selections of this period from German literature are\r\ninconsiderable. They include:\r\n\r\nLessing, _Erziehung des Menschen-geschlechts_, prohibited 1835.\r\n\r\nHeine, H., _Reisebilder_, printed in 1834, prohibited in 1836;\r\n_De la France_, printed in 1833, prohibited in 1836; _De\r\nl’Allemagne_, printed in 1835, prohibited 1836; _Gedichte_,\r\nprinted in 1844, prohibited in 1845.\r\n\r\nIn 1855, Mrs. Stowe’s _Uncle Tom’s Cabin_ was prohibited, under\r\nsome special instruction, as far as its sale in the papal States was\r\nconcerned. The title does not find place in the Index.\r\n\r\nThe small group of Spanish and Portuguese works includes the following\r\ntitles:\r\n\r\nTorres, _Quentos en verso Castilano del Remédo de la Melencholia_,\r\nprohibited 1824.\r\n\r\nTressera, _El Judio Errante_, prohibited 1864.\r\n\r\nThe long series of anti-clerical romances by Benito, Perez, and Galdós\r\nescape condemnation.\r\n\r\nStockler, _Poezias Liricas_, printed in 1820, prohibited in 1836.\r\n\r\nThe Italian list includes:\r\n\r\nFoscolo, Ugo, translation of Sterne’s _Sentimental Journey_, printed in\r\n1817, prohibited in 1819; _La Commedia di Dante_, illustrated, printed\r\nin 1830, prohibited in 1845.\r\n\r\nZaccheroni, G., an edition of Dante’s _Inferno_ with notes, printed\r\nin 1838, prohibited (as far as the introduction and the notes are\r\nconcerned) by the Inquisition in 1840. The larger number of the\r\ncommentaries on Dante are condemned as printed.\r\n\r\nGuerrazzi, Dom., _L’Assedio di Firenze_, printed in 1830, prohibited in\r\n1837. His later romances, _Isabella Orsini_ and _Beatrice Cenci_, were\r\nprohibited promptly on publication, the former in 1844, the latter in\r\n1854.\r\n\r\nNiccolini, G. B., _Arnaldo da Brescia_, printed in 1844, prohibited the\r\nsame year.\r\n\r\nBossie, Conte Luigi, _Della Istoria d’Italia Antica e Moderna_, printed\r\nin Milan, 1819–1822, in nineteen volumes, prohibited in 1824. The same\r\nauthor produced a translation of Roscoe’s _Life of Leo X_, which was\r\npromptly condemned some twenty years after the prohibition of the same\r\nwork in the original.\r\n\r\nBotta, Carlo, _Storia d’Italia del 1729 al 1814_, ten volumes, printed\r\nin 1824, prohibited in 1826. Botta had gained the name of “the Italian\r\nTacitus.” His son, Vincenzo Botta, was well known in New York as a man\r\nof letters, between the years 1850 (he was one of the exiles of ’48)\r\nand 1880.\r\n\r\nRossetti, Gabrielle, _Sullo Spirito anti-Papale_, etc., printed in\r\n1832, prohibited 1833; _Iddio a l’Uomo_, printed in 1836, prohibited\r\n1837.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish and Portuguese group of general literature of this period\r\nincludes the following titles:\r\n\r\nLlorente, J. A., _Histoire Critique de l’Inquisition de l’Espagne_,\r\nprinted in Paris in 1820, prohibited in 1822. The author, who was the\r\nSecretary-General of the Inquisition, had been banished from Spain in\r\n1812. His history, written in Spanish, was translated under his own\r\nsupervision.\r\n\r\n_Historia Completa des Inquisiçoes de Italia, Hispagnia e Portugal_,\r\nprinted (anonymously) in 1822, prohibited in 1825. This is probably\r\na translation of the _Histoire de l’Inquisition of Lavalée_ printed\r\nin Paris in 1809, and prohibited in 1819. The histories of the\r\nInquisition, whether written from the Dominican point of view or from\r\nthat of their opponents, found their way in great part into the Index.\r\n\r\n\r\n=26. The Synod of Pistoja, 1786.=--In 1794, the conclusions arrived at\r\nby the Diocesan Synod held at Pistoja at the instance of Bishop Ricci,\r\nwere condemned by the Bull _Auctorem Fidei_ of Pius VI. In this Bull,\r\nwere censured specifically eighty-five propositions. The Pope condemns\r\nand prohibits, under penalty of excommunication, the printing,\r\ndistribution, or reading of any editions or translations of the acts\r\nof the synod and of all works written in defence of these acts. It\r\nis doubtless through oversight that this very sweeping condemnation\r\ndoes not find place in the Index. Certain publications reporting the\r\nconclusions of the synod had been already specifically prohibited;\r\nwhile certain further works, the subjects of which were connected with\r\nthe issues raised by the synod, were prohibited in later years, in\r\ncertain instances as late as 1817. For these later prohibitions, the\r\nstatement was added that the works were already condemned under the\r\nBull _Auctorem Fidei_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=27. The Festival of the Heart of Jesus.=--In 1697 and again in 1729,\r\nthe Congregation of Rites recalled the authorisation for a specific\r\noffice for the Sacred Heart of Jesus; and in 1704, was prohibited the\r\ntreatise by the Jesuit Croiset, written in defence of this office.\r\nUnder Clement XIII in 1765, the office was again authorised, and\r\nunder Pius IX, the festival in honour of the Heart of Jesus was made\r\na general usage. This special act of adoration had originated with\r\nthe Jesuits; those who opposed it were classed as Jansenists. The\r\noffice came, however, into question with a good many Churchmen other\r\nthan Ricci and his friends; and a number of the most important of the\r\ntreatises written against it were published under Clement XIV in Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n=28. Theological Writings of French, German, and English Catholics,\r\n1758–1800.=--But one important work of theology printed in France,\r\n_Theologia Lugdunensis_, came upon the Index during the last\r\ndecade of the 18th century. From England, the single title of the same\r\nperiod covers a book of worship, and from Germany, were prohibited,\r\nin addition to the writings already referred to, a volume by Isenbiehl\r\nand several treatises by Stättler, Meyer, and Oberrauch. During these\r\nyears, were published in England a number of works by Catholic authors\r\nwhich had to do with the controversies of the time, such as the Oath\r\nof Allegiance, the re-institution of the hierarchy of bishops, etc.,\r\nbut no one of these writings is recorded in the Index. The single\r\nEnglish work above referred to was published in London, in 1767, under\r\nthe title _The Catholik Christians’ New Universal Manual, being a\r\ntrue spiritual guide for those who ardently aspire to salvation_.\r\nThe book contains the entry, _Permissu superiorum_, which did not\r\nprevent its prohibition in 1770. On the other hand, the writings of\r\nCharles Dodd, J. Berington, Alexander Geddes, George Cooper, and Bishop\r\nButler, the teachings of which would hardly have met the approval of\r\nthe Holy See, escaped condemnation.\r\n\r\n\r\n=29. The French Revolution.=--The _Constitution Civile_ of the clergy,\r\nframed in 1780, and the Defence of the same issued a year later by the\r\nso-called Constitutional Bishops, were promptly condemned by briefs\r\nof Pius VI, but they do not find place in the Index. The acts of the\r\nnational councils of 1797 and 1801 were condemned in like manner but\r\nthese titles also escaped the attention of the Index compilers. The\r\npractice on the part of the Index editors in regard to the recording\r\nof legislative acts appears not to have been consistent. In 1817, for\r\ninstance, a collection of the acts and declarations of the Italian\r\nbishops and chapters, which had been printed in 1811, was placed upon\r\nthe Index although the subscribers and compilers of the same had made\r\nrecantation of the opinions expressed.\r\n\r\nThe long series of revolutionary writings and of anti-Church writings\r\nwhich came into print in France after 1789 were in large part recorded\r\nby the Spanish Inquisition but in the Roman Indexes are represented by\r\nonly a few titles.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1797, the Congregation of the Index publishes its last\r\ndecree for the century. The authors whose books are condemned include\r\nStättler, Oberrauch, Tamburini, and Zola; in addition to these, there\r\nis a series of German theological and juristical theses which the\r\nstudents of Freiburg had defended between the years 1786 and 1794. The\r\nlast work prohibited by the Inquisition during the 18th century is a\r\ntreatise by Guadagnini.\r\n\r\nThe first prohibition of the 19th century condemns a monograph by a\r\nGreek theologian, printed in Corfu in 1800. The Congregation of the\r\nIndex resumed its activities in 1804 after a suspension of more than\r\nseven years. In decrees issued in 1804, 1805, 1806, and 1808 were\r\ncondemned a number of French and Italian writings that had to do with\r\nthe Revolution. The imprisonment in June, 1809, of Pius VII again\r\nbrought to a close the operations of the Roman Congregations. The Pope\r\nreturned to Rome in May, 1814, and in August, 1815, the Inquisition\r\nresumed its supervision of literature. The work of the Congregation of\r\nthe Index was, however, not taken up till January, 1817. In this year,\r\na list of prohibitions was issued covering a number of works that had\r\nbeen published in France and in Italy between 1796 and 1815.\r\n\r\nThe two briefs that Pius VI had issued in March and in April, 1781,\r\nfor the condemnation of the so-called Civil Constitution of the French\r\nclergy, were declared by the “constitutional” party in the Church to\r\nbe apocryphal. It was pointed out that the second brief, while dated\r\nin Rome, April 13th, was distributed in Paris April 14th, from which\r\ndetail, it came to be known as the “Miraculous Brief.” In a brief\r\nissued in 1792, the Pope calls attention to this statement as one of\r\nthe insults coming from France. The Index of 1806 contains, printed as\r\nan appendix, a list of the books prohibited from 1804 to 1806. The more\r\nimportant names in this list are those of Voltaire, Rousseau, Diderot,\r\nMirabeau, Dulaurens, and La Fontaine.\r\n\r\n\r\n=30. The French Concordat of 1801.=--In August, 1801, a Bull of\r\nPius VII records the provisions of the Concordat that had been arrived\r\nat between Napoleon and himself. Under the Concordat, the number of\r\nthe French bishoprics was reduced from a hundred and fifty-six to\r\nsixty and a new division of the dioceses was provided for. In a brief\r\nbearing the same date, the Pope calls for the resignation of all the\r\nFrench bishops, and in November of 1801, he issues a second Bull,\r\ndeclaring those bishops who had not resigned to be deposed, and fixing\r\nthe limits of the new bishoprics. In 1803, thirty-six bishops present a\r\nprotest against these regulations. This protest was widely circulated\r\nand served as the text for a long series of monographs in which were\r\nbrought into discussion various questions relating to the Concordat.\r\nIn 1817, a second Concordat was put into force between the Papacy and\r\nLouis XVIII. In 1822, a long series of writings which took ground\r\nagainst the authority of this Concordat were placed upon the Index.\r\n\r\n\r\n=31. Protestant Theological Writings, 1750–1884.=--The selections\r\nfor condemnation, in the last years of the 18th century and during the\r\nfirst half of the 19th century, of works by Protestant theologians\r\nappears to have been made with no greater consistency and with no\r\nmore assured principles than had been apparent in the selection of\r\nProtestant writings of an earlier date. The following titles may be\r\nnoted:\r\n\r\nMichaelis, J. D., _Introduction to the New Testament_, published\r\nin 1750, condemned in 1827.\r\n\r\nStrauss, _The Life of Jesus_ (_Das Leben Jesu_), published in\r\n1835, prohibited 1838.\r\n\r\nBauer, _Streit der Kritik mit Kirche und Staat_, published in\r\n1844, prohibited in 1845.\r\n\r\nBunsen, _Hippolytus and his Age_, published 1852, prohibited 1854.\r\n\r\nMaurice, F. D., _Theological Essays_, published 1854, prohibited\r\n1854 (the entry in the Index is under the word “Denison”).\r\n\r\nStroud, _The Physical Causes of the Death of Christ_, published\r\n1847, prohibited 1878.\r\n\r\nMorgan, Lady, _Italy_, prohibited 1822.\r\n\r\nWaldie, _Rome in the Nineteenth Century_, published 1820,\r\nprohibited 1826.\r\n\r\nBlunt, James, _Vestiges of Ancient Manners and Customs in Modern\r\nItaly and Sicily_, published 1823, prohibited 1827. The difficulty\r\nwith Mr. Blunt’s treatise was the connection made by him between\r\ncertain ceremonies and practices of the Roman Church and the earlier\r\nPagan usages.\r\n\r\nSeymour, Hobart, _A Pilgrimage to Rome_, printed 1851, prohibited\r\n1851. The title is entered under “Pilgrimage.”\r\n\r\nWhately, Archbishop, _Introductory Lessons on Christian\r\nEvidences_, an Italian version printed in 1850 and prohibited in the\r\nsame year.\r\n\r\nThe treatise by John Poynde, _Popery in Alliance with Heathenism_, the\r\npublication of which (in 1835) brought out some sharp controversial\r\nletters from Wiseman, escaped the attention of the Index compilers.\r\n\r\nThe more noteworthy of the French titles in the Indexes of this period\r\nare the following:\r\n\r\nBruitte, Edouard, abbé and professor of philosophy, _Mes Adieux à\r\nRome_, published in 1844, prohibited in 1844.\r\n\r\nMourette, _Le Pape et l’Évangile_, published in 1844, prohibited\r\nin 1845. This latter was also prohibited in Paris.\r\n\r\nCoquerel, Athanase, (†1868), _Le Christianisme experimental_,\r\npublished in 1847, prohibited in 1850. No other of the series of\r\nwritings by this famous Protestant preacher nor any of those of his\r\nson, Athanase Josue, find place in the Index.\r\n\r\nBugnoin, T. R., _Catéchisme de l’Église du Seigneur_, published in\r\n1862, prohibited in 1863.\r\n\r\nMartig, Emm., _Manuel d’Histoire religieuse a l’Usage des Écoles_,\r\npublished at Geneva in 1877, prohibited in 1878.\r\n\r\nD’Aubigné, _l’Histoire de la Réforme du Seizième Siècle_, printed,\r\nin an Italian edition, in 1847, prohibited in 1852.\r\n\r\nThe list of Italian and Spanish publications contains few names that\r\nwould be familiar to English readers.\r\n\r\nBianchi, Angiolo, _Biographia di Fra Paolo Sarpi_, printed (in\r\nBrussels) in 1836, prohibited in 1844; _Del Pontificato di S.\r\nGregorio il grande_, printed (in Milan) in 1844, prohibited in 1853.\r\n\r\nBoni, Filippo de, _Del Papato_, printed in 1850, prohibited in\r\n1852.\r\n\r\nCastro, Adolpho de, _Historia des los Protestantes Españoles_,\r\nprinted in 1851, prohibited in the same year.\r\n\r\n\r\n=32. Writings concerning the Eastern Church.=--The larger number\r\nof the works under this heading the titles of which come into the Index\r\nof the 19th century, are the production of the “United Armenians.” The\r\naddition of a group of monographs by Polish writers is doubtless due\r\nto the fact that during the reign of Pius IX, the consultor of the\r\nCongregation was a Pole, Peter Semenenko. The Bull issued by Pius IX\r\nin July, 1867, under the title of _Reversurus_, in which it had\r\nbeen ordered that the procedure of worship of the Armenians should be\r\nreconstituted, resulted in a schism in this division of the Church.\r\nBetween the years 1872 and 1873, three monographs by Ormanian and one\r\nby Casangian, written in opposition to this Bull, are placed upon the\r\nIndex. The list also includes the following:\r\n\r\nPichler, A., _Die kirchliche Trennung zwischen Orient und Occident_.\r\n\r\nThe Greek Church of Russia is represented in the Index of this time by\r\nbut one or two titles:\r\n\r\nTolstoy, Dimitri, _Le Catholicisme Romain ou Russe_, published in 1864,\r\nprohibited in 1866. This work stands in the Index under the entry\r\n“Dimitri.” The entry is connected with the reference _Opus praedamnatum\r\nex reg. II. ind._ This entry indicates that, prior to 1870, the\r\nRussians were already classed as heretics.\r\n\r\nPociej, Joh. (Chancellor of the Cathedral at Chelm), _O Jezusie\r\nChrystusie_ (a study of the record of the early Christians), printed\r\nin 1852 (with the approval of the Church authorities at Warsaw),\r\nprohibited in 1857.\r\n\r\nThe record of the proceedings of a Synod of Melchites, held in 1810,\r\nin Beyrout, with the approval of the papal delegate, Gandolfi, was\r\ncondemned in 1835 by a brief of Gregory XVI. The record had been\r\nprinted in Arabic and was not likely therefore to have secured an\r\nextended circulation in Catholic States.\r\n\r\nIn 1851, was prohibited an Italian version of the _Critical History\r\nof the Greek and Russian Church_ by Josef Schmitt, which had been\r\npublished in Mayence in 1840. In 1868, was prohibited a work by the\r\nEnglish writer, Edmund S. Ffoulkes, which had been published in London\r\nin 1865 under the title, _Christendom’s Divisions, a Philosophical\r\nSketch of the Divisions of the Christian Family in East and West_.\r\nThe work had been sharply criticised by Manning, but it does not appear\r\nthat Manning had made any formal denunciation of the same to Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n=33. The Theologians of Pavia, 1774–1790.=--In 1774, the Austrian\r\nGovernment instituted a theological faculty in the University of\r\nPavia. In 1783, the Emperor Joseph II transferred to Pavia, for use in\r\nthe newly instituted _Collegium Germanicum et Hungaricum_, the\r\ncollections belonging to the old _Collegium Germanicum_ of Milan.\r\nThe divines of the theological faculty of Pavia came to be classed as\r\nJansenists. The classification appears to have been based not so much\r\nupon their teaching of the Augustinian doctrine of Grace as upon their\r\nown sharp antagonism to the theories and practices of the Jesuits.\r\nThese divines contended openly that the so-called Jansenist heresy\r\nwas a phantom, and they also undertook the defence of the Church of\r\nUtrecht. They were, further, opponents of the doctrines taught by the\r\nJesuits in regard to morality; they were in sympathy with the claims\r\nof the Gallican Church, and, finally, they maintained stoutly the\r\nnecessity for reforms within the Catholic Church on the lines indicated\r\nby the Synod of Pistoja. In the years succeeding 1781, were placed\r\nupon the Index the titles of a number of writings by these theologians\r\nand by others who had accepted their views. Among these writers may\r\nbe mentioned the following: Pietro Tamburini, Giuseppe Zola, Count\r\nTh. Trautmannsdorf, Canon Litta, and G. B. Guadagnini. The treatise\r\nby Trautmannsdorf on Toleration, condemned in 1783, the author found\r\ndesirable to disavow in order to secure his appointment as bishop.\r\n\r\n\r\n=34. French, Dutch, and English Writings, 1817–1880.=--In 1825, a\r\nreport was laid before the French Minister of the Interior concerning\r\ncertain writings classed as irreligious or immoral which had been\r\npublished between the years 1817 and 1824. The list included various\r\neditions of the complete works of Voltaire and of Rousseau, together\r\nwith a number of issues of their separate volumes. There were no less\r\nthan eight editions of the _Système de la Nature_, by d’Holbach,\r\nand four of the _Lettres Persanes_. It was complained that these\r\npernicious books were being sold so cheaply that they were brought\r\nwithin the reach of the masses of the people and were bringing about\r\nwidespread evil. The _Tartuffe_ of Molière, sold for five sous,\r\nhad at once reached a sale of one hundred thousand copies. In 1821,\r\nÉtienne Antoine, Bishop of Troyes, in a pastoral letter writes: “We\r\nrenew all the censorship orders issued, between the years 1782 and\r\n1785, by the clergy of France, and the individual orders issued by the\r\narchbishops of Paris, in which these works were condemned as godless\r\nand sacrilegious, and as tending to undermine morals and the State. We\r\nprohibit, under the canonical law, the printing or sale of these books\r\nwithin the territory of this diocese, and we charge the vicar-generals\r\nto enforce this regulation and to see to the carrying out of the\r\nnecessary penances for all who make confession of disobedience to\r\nthese regulations.” The authority of the Church of France appears to\r\nhave been considered as sufficient for the control of the matter. No\r\napplication was made to have these books again placed upon the Index.\r\n\r\nDupuis, Ch. Fr., _Origine de tous les Cultes_, printed 1794,\r\nprohibited, 1818. An abridgment of this work, printed in 1798 and\r\nreprinted in a number of editions thereafter, escaped condemnation.\r\n\r\nVolney, J. F., _Les Ruines ou Méditations sur les Révolutions des\r\nEmpires_, printed in 1799, prohibited in 1821. This book was also\r\nstrongly condemned in the Spanish Indexes. An Italian translation,\r\nprinted in 1849, escaped the Index.\r\n\r\nPigault, Le Brun, _Le Citateur_, printed in 1803, prohibited in 1820.\r\nThis work contains some bitter assaults on the Bible and on the dogmas\r\nof Christianity. Reiffenberg states that, in 1811, Napoleon, in a state\r\nof irritation with a brief of Pius VII, gave instructions for the\r\ndistribution to the public, free or at a nominal price, of ten thousand\r\ncopies of _Le Citateur_, but there is no record that these instructions\r\nwere carried out. A Spanish version of the book, printed in London in\r\n1816, was prohibited in Spain in 1819.\r\n\r\n_Essai historique sur la Puissance temporelle des Papes_, printed\r\nin Paris in 1818, prohibited in 1823. No author’s name is connected\r\nwith any of the several editions of this treatise, but the introduction\r\nto the original issue states that the work was translated from a\r\nSpanish manuscript found at Saragossa.\r\n\r\nAfter the Restoration, negotiations were in train during a series of\r\nyears for a modification of the provisions of the Concordat of 1801. A\r\nseries of controversial publications bearing upon the Concordat were\r\nplaced upon the Index as they appeared.\r\n\r\nConstant, Benjamin, _De la Religion Considerée dans sa Source_, etc.,\r\nprinted in 1824–1831, in five volumes, prohibited in 1827.\r\n\r\nGandolphy, Peter, _A Defence of the Ancient Faith, or Exposition of\r\nthe Christian Religion_, printed (in London) in 1813, prohibited\r\nin 1818. Gandolphy was a priest of the Catholic Church and at the\r\ntime of this publication had charge of the Spanish Chapel in London.\r\nThe book had been promptly condemned by Pointer, Apostolic Vicar in\r\nLondon. Gandolphy journeyed to Rome and succeeded in securing for his\r\nbook the approval of the master of the palace and a certificate giving\r\nhim the authority to state that his book had been approved by the Holy\r\nSee. On the strength of this certificate, he placed copies again on\r\nsale. Pointer secured from the Inquisition instructions to confirm the\r\nprohibition, and as this was still ignored by Gandolphy, the latter was\r\nsuspended. After some years of controversy, the difficulty was finally\r\nadjusted by the correction of the text according to the specifications\r\nof Pointer.\r\n\r\nEarle, Charles J., _The Forty Days, or Christ between His Resurrection\r\nand Ascension_ and _The Spiritual Body_. These were printed in 1876 and\r\n1878 and were prohibited in 1880. Earle had in 1851 been converted to\r\nRomanism.\r\n\r\nIn 1857, an association was instituted in England “for the promotion\r\nof the unity of Christendom.” Its special purpose was to bring\r\ntogether the members of the Catholic, the Greek, and the English\r\nChurches. The members of the society accepted the obligation to make\r\na daily prayer to this end. Cardinal Patrizzi declared in the name\r\nof the Inquisition, in a letter addressed, September, 1864, to the\r\nEnglish bishops, that Catholics were forbidden to take part in this\r\nassociation. In 1866, Archbishop Manning confirmed this prohibition.\r\nPatrizzi had condemned in his first letter the _Union Review_, which\r\nwas the organ of the society, but the _Review_ was not placed on the\r\nIndex. A series of essays on the reunion of Christendom, written by\r\nmembers of the society, and edited by F. G. Lee, was placed on the\r\nIndex in 1867.\r\n\r\n\r\n=35. Writings of German Catholics, 1814–1870.=--During the 19th\r\ncentury, were placed upon the Index a larger proportion than in the\r\nearlier period of the writings of the Catholics of Germany, but the\r\nselection of the works so distinguished appears as heretofore to have\r\nbeen arrived at with no very definite policy or principle. It is\r\nevident that the books were not selected on the ground either of their\r\nrelative heresy, of their scholarly importance, or of their popular\r\ninfluence. It seems probable that the condemnation of any particular\r\nwork was dependent upon the accident of its title being brought to\r\nthe attention of the Congregation. The names of a few of the more\r\nnoteworthy authors in the list are specified below.\r\n\r\nWessenberg, Vicar-General of Constance, _Die deutsche Kirche_,\r\nprinted in 1806, condemned by a brief of Pius VII, in 1814.\r\n\r\nDannemayer, _Institutiones Historiae Ecclesiasticae_, printed (in\r\nVienna) in 1780, prohibited in 1820.\r\n\r\nRechberger, _Enchiridion Juris Eccles. Austriaci_, printed in\r\n1809, prohibited in 1819.\r\n\r\nReyberger, _Institutiones Ethicae Christ._, printed in 1805–9,\r\nprohibited 1834.\r\n\r\nBolzano Bernhard (professor of geology in Prague), _Stunden der\r\nAndacht_, printed in 1813, prohibited in 1828. It was largely\r\non the ground of this work, which was published anonymously,\r\nthat Bolzano was deposed from his professorship. _Lehrbuch der\r\nReligions-Wissenschaft_, printed in 1813, prohibited 1838.\r\n\r\nBrendel, Sabold, professor of law in Würzburg, _Handbuch des kath.\r\nund protest. Kirchenrechts_, etc., printed in 1823, prohibited in\r\n1824. Brendel retained his professorship but was later ordered to give\r\nup instruction in canon law.\r\n\r\nTheiner, Anton., _Die katholische Kirche in Schlesien_ (published\r\nanonymously), printed in 1826, prohibited the same year.\r\n\r\nMüller, Alexander, _Handbuch des kath. und protest. Kirchenrechts_,\r\nprinted 1829–1832, prohibited in 1833. It would appear that very few\r\nof the treatises on canon law or ecclesiastical jurisprudence were so\r\nwritten as to meet the approval of the Index authorities.\r\n\r\nHirscher, J. B., a treatise on the mass, entitled _Missae Genuinam\r\nNotionem Eruere_, etc., printed in 1821, prohibited in 1823.\r\n\r\nDrey, G. S. von, a treatise on confession, entitled _Diss. Hist.\r\ntheol. Originem et Vicissitudinem_, etc., printed, in 1815,\r\nprohibited in 1823.\r\n\r\nGehringer, _Liturgik und Theorie der Seelsorge_, printed in 1848,\r\nprohibited in 1850.\r\n\r\nHermes, George, _Die philosophische Einleitung in die christ.\r\nkatholische Theologie_, printed in 1819, prohibited in 1831.\r\nThe other writings by this author, together with a long series of\r\ntreatises by his followers, were for the most part prohibited. It was\r\ncontended by the Hermessians, as it had formerly been contended by\r\nthe Jansenists, that the specific errors on the ground of which the\r\ncondemnations had been arrived at did not as a matter of fact exist\r\nin the writings of Hermes. In May, 1837, six years after the death\r\nof Hermes, Professors Braun and Elvenich journeyed to Rome for the\r\npurpose of securing a fresh examination of the works of Hermes and of\r\nestablishing their orthodoxy, but after a series of conferences, they\r\nfailed to secure the recall of condemnation.\r\n\r\nGünther, A., _Peregrins Gastmahl, Janusköpfe für Philosophie und\r\nTheologie_, and a group of similar writings published between 1830\r\nand 1843, were condemned together in 1857. The Congregation of the\r\nIndex began in 1851 to give special attention to Günther. In 1852,\r\ninstructions were given by Pius IX to the bishop of Wurzburg to\r\nprohibit the teaching of the theories that had become known as the\r\nphilosophy of Günther.\r\n\r\nTrebisch, Leop. (classed as a follower of Günther), _Die christliche\r\nWeltanschauung in ihrer Bedeutung für Wissenschaft und Leben_,\r\nprinted in 1858, prohibited in 1859.\r\n\r\nFrohschammer, J., _Ueber den Ursprung der menschlichen Seelen_, printed\r\nin 1854, prohibited in 1857. The work of Frohschammer was brought upon\r\nthe Index by the influence of the Jesuit Kleutgen. It is recorded\r\nthat the secretary of the Congregation asked Dr. Döllinger, who was\r\nat the time in Rome, to induce Frohschammer to submit himself and to\r\nrecall his treatise, but no such action was taken by the author. His\r\nlater treatises, _Einleitung in die Philosophie_, _Der Grundriss der\r\nMetaphysik_, and _Ueber die Freiheit der Wissenschaft_, were prohibited\r\ntogether in 1862. He was suspended from his functions in 1863, and in\r\n1871, placed under excommunication. In the introduction to the papal\r\nbrief of 1863, Pius writes that he had learned with great sorrow that a\r\nnumber of the theologians and instructors in philosophy having chairs\r\nin the Catholic institutions of Germany had permitted themselves to\r\nbring into their teachings an unwarranted license of thought and of\r\nexpression. The works through which these teachings were distributed to\r\nthe general public were in many cases carrying most pernicious errors.\r\nThese works, in so far as they had been examined and reported upon, the\r\nPope had therefore ordered to be placed on the Index.\r\n\r\nOischinger, Paul J. N., who appears to have belonged to the same\r\ntheological group with Frohschammer, is recorded as the author of a\r\nlong series of philosophical works, only one of which was placed upon\r\nthe Index: _Die spekulative Theologie des H. Thomas von Aquin_,\r\nprinted in 1859, prohibited in 1859. Oischinger maintains that Thomas\r\nhad wrongly comprehended a number of the most important divisions of\r\nthe dogma of the Church.\r\n\r\nPichler, Aloys, _Geschichte der kirklichen Trennung zwischen dem\r\nOrient und Occident_, printed in 1865, prohibited in 1866. _Die\r\nTheologie des Leibnitz_, printed in 1869, prohibited in 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n=36. La Mennais.=--The writings of Abbé La Mennais had, even\r\nbefore 1830, brought out in France some measure of criticism. They\r\nhad, however, secured the approval of Leo XII. After the Revolution\r\nof July, 1830, the opinions of La Mennais and his associates were\r\ncondemned in Rome as in more ways than one pernicious. In August, 1832,\r\nGregory XVI, in the encyclical entitled _Mirari_, condemned the\r\necclesiastical and political opinions presented in the journal issued\r\nby La Mennais and his associates under the title _L’Avenir_. No\r\none of the writers was mentioned by name, but in a letter by Cardinal\r\nPacca accompanying the encyclical, they were informed that the\r\ncondemnation applied to their work. They all submitted themselves to\r\nthe authority of the Church. After some negotiations, La Mennais, in\r\nDecember, 1833, gave his signature to a formula which had been sent\r\nfrom Rome for the purpose. A few months later, however, he brought into\r\nprint a monograph entitled _Paroles d’un Croyant_, through the\r\ndeclarations in which he made a direct breach with Rome. In June, 1834,\r\nhe received, through a separate encyclical, sharp condemnation. A year\r\nlater, the Congregation placed on the Index the treatise _Affaires de\r\nRome_ and the subsequent writings were prohibited promptly on their\r\nappearance. The earliest publication of La Mennais, issued in 1809\r\nunder the title _Réflexions sur l’État de l’Eglise en France pendant\r\nle XVIII^{me} Siècle et sur la Situation actuelle_, was promptly\r\nsuppressed by the imperial police, but was not placed upon the Index.\r\nThe _Essai sur l’Indifférence en matières de Religion_, published\r\nin 1817–1820, was sharply criticised in France but was not condemned in\r\nRome. The monograph _De la Religion Considérée dans ses Rapports avec\r\nl’Ordre Politique et Civile_, printed in 1826, was condemned by a\r\nnumber of the bishops and the author was sentenced by the courts to the\r\npayment of a large fine.\r\n\r\nThe journal _L’Avenir_, previously referred to, had for its\r\npurpose the maintenance of the independence of the Gallican Church\r\nagainst the encroachments of the Ultramontanes, and also the final\r\nseparation of Church and State. The publication of the journal was\r\nsuspended by the Government in 1831, and Lacordaire and Montalembert\r\njourneyed to Rome to present the case of its editors. A _Mémoire_\r\nwritten by Lacordaire was delivered in February, 1832, to Cardinal\r\nPacca. In this, the memorialists asked the pope to have thorough\r\ninvestigation made of their purpose and actions and to give permission\r\nfor the continuation of their work. After some weeks, Pacca gave\r\ndecision on behalf of the pope that, while the good service rendered\r\nin the past by the memorialists was fully acknowledged, he found\r\nground for grave disapproval of their later actions in stirring up\r\ncontroversies which tended to bring the authority of the Church into\r\ndisrepute. While the matter was under consideration, an appeal came\r\nto Rome from thirteen of the bishops of France, asking the pope to\r\nconfirm the condemnation of _L’Avenir_ and specifying fifty-six\r\npropositions which were in themselves sufficient ground for its\r\ncondemnation. This memorial secured later the support of fifty further\r\nFrench bishops. In September, 1832, La Mennais and his associates sent\r\nto Rome an acknowledgment of the decision of the pope and made promise\r\nthat the journal _L’Avenir_ should no longer be printed. In May,\r\n1833, the pope sent to the Archbishop of Toulouse a brief in which he\r\nmade reply to the memorial of the bishops. He pointed out that in the\r\nencyclical he had presented the sound and final doctrine of the Church\r\nand that he had taken measures to prevent the further circulation of\r\nthe pernicious opinions complained of by the bishops.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1833, La Mennais sent to the pope through the Bishop of\r\nRheims a letter in which he protests against the strictures expressed\r\nin the papal brief. He professes himself prepared to give the fullest\r\npossible acceptance to all provisions of the Holy See which have\r\nto do with matters of doctrine and of morals. He asks the pope to\r\nindicate the expressions occurring in his writings which are open to\r\ncondemnation. In October, 1833, the pope replies to the Bishop of\r\nRheims, pointing out certain statements by La Mennais the purport of\r\nwhich tends to undermine the authority of the Church. La Mennais had\r\ntaken the ground that he was not undertaking to interfere with purely\r\necclesiastical questions. While in such matters he gave the fullest\r\nacceptance to the authority of the pope, he was not prepared to accept\r\nthe judgment of the pope in matters that seemed to him to be outside of\r\nthe proper authority of the Holy See.\r\n\r\nIn 1834, La Mennais published, under the title of _Affaires de Rome_,\r\na report concerning his correspondence and relations with the Holy\r\nSee. This was duly prohibited by the Congregation in 1835. _Le Livre\r\ndu Peuple_, printed in 1837, was prohibited in 1838. The same course\r\nwas taken with his later writings, appearing between 1841 and 1846. La\r\nMennais died in February, 1854. The set of his works in five volumes,\r\npublished after his death, 1855–1858, does not appear in the Index.\r\n\r\n\r\n=37. The Roman Revolution of 1848.=--The operations of the Index\r\nCongregation were not intermitted on the ground of the absence of\r\nPius IX from Rome, from November 25, 1848, to April 12, 1850. During\r\nthis period, three sessions were held in Rome and two in Naples,\r\nand judgment was passed upon a number of the more important of the\r\npublications of the day. Among those condemned the following titles may\r\nbe noted:\r\n\r\nRosmini, Antonio, _Die fünf Wünder der h. Kirche_, and _Die Verfassung\r\ngemäss der socialen Gerechtigkeit_.\r\n\r\nGisberti, V., _Der moderne Jesuit_.\r\n\r\nVentura, G., _Discorso funebre dei morti di Vienna_, etc. (The three\r\ntitles in German are recorded in Italian.)\r\n\r\nA few months before the condemnation of the two treatises of Rosmini,\r\nhis name had been under consideration with the pope for appointment\r\nas cardinal. His theological and philosophical writings had been\r\ndenounced by his theological opponents as early as 1841, but, in 1843,\r\nGregory XVI had ordered the controversies concerning the doctrines of\r\nRosmini to be brought to a close. In 1850, the denunciation of the\r\nwritings of Rosmini was renewed. The Congregation of the Index caused\r\nan examination of the works to be made by a number of consultors and,\r\nin 1854, the judgment was given that they were not to be disapproved,\r\n_dimittantur opera_. This continued controversy concerning the\r\nphilosophical and theological teachings of Rosmini brought about, in\r\n1880, an authoritative definition of the formula _dimittantur_.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1848, Pius IX took refuge in Gaeta. Rosmini followed the\r\nPope thither, but finding that the influence of his opponent, Cardinal\r\nAntonelli, was still controlling, he returned without securing any\r\npersonal consideration. A series of negotiations, controversies,\r\nand correspondence followed, but it was not until 1854 that his\r\nworks finally secured quittance. The question then placed before\r\nthe Congregation was whether, as the writings of Rosmini had been\r\nthoroughly examined and had been shown to be free from errors in\r\nmatters both of doctrine and morality, the prohibition that had been\r\nplaced upon them ought not to be cancelled. The Jesuits were still\r\nunwilling to give up their contest against the teachings of Rosmini.\r\nThey pointed out that the Inquisition held higher authority than that\r\nof the Congregation, and that in a number of instances books which had\r\nbeen passed with approval by the Congregation had been condemned by\r\nthe Inquisition. Cornaldi, in a treatise printed in 1882, contended\r\nthat the philosophy of Rosmini was distinctly opposed to the doctrines\r\nof St. Thomas. Leo XIII, in a brief addressed, in January, 1882, to\r\nthe Bishops of Milan and Turin, reproves the attempts to renew the\r\ncontroversies concerning Rosmini and calls attention to his encyclical\r\nin which he had indicated the way by which all devout philosophers\r\ncould arrive at a harmony of conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n=38. Traditionalism and Ontology, 1833–1880.=--In 1833, Abbé\r\nBautain of Strasburg was responsible for the initiating of certain\r\ncontroversies, in part philosophical and in part theological,\r\nwhich appear to have turned upon the proper interpretation of the\r\ndoctrines so-called of Traditionalism and Ontologism. In 1870, these\r\ncontroversies were revived in Louvain and in Paris with the result of\r\nbringing out certain condemnations from the Congregation and from the\r\nInquisition. In 1840, Bautain was compelled to subscribe to certain\r\npropositions formulated by the Congregation, and in 1855 his associate\r\nBonnetty took the same course. In 1861, the Inquisition declared seven\r\npropositions, selected from the writings of Ubagh and other French\r\nOntologists, to be heretical. Ubagh was compelled to correct certain\r\ntreatises of his own according to specifications laid down by the\r\nIndex; and, in 1866, after lengthy negotiations, his friends in Louvain\r\nwere obliged to declare their acceptance of the reproval and of the\r\nconclusions of the Congregation and of the Inquisition. Ubagh held in\r\nthe University of Louvain the chair of philosophy and logic.\r\n\r\n\r\n=39. Attritio and the Peccatum Philosophicum.=--In addition to\r\nthe Inquisition’s decrees in which whole series of propositions were\r\ncondemned, certain decrees were issued in which consideration was\r\ngiven to one or two propositions. In May, 1667, Alexander VII issued\r\na decree in which, while not undertaking to decide the issue that had\r\narisen concerning the sufficiency of incomplete repentance to secure\r\nabsolution, he prohibited any writings which maintained that one view\r\nor the other of the matter was in itself heretical. In August, 1690,\r\na decree of Alexander VIII condemns the two propositions, first, that\r\nthe love of God is not requisite for the leading of a proper life, and,\r\nsecond, the theory that a sin which has been committed by some one who\r\ndoes not know God, or committed during a moment in which the sinner is\r\nnot thinking of God, (the so-called philosophical sin as distinguished\r\nfrom the theological sin) is not to be classed as a mortal sin. These\r\ntwo definitions of the Inquisition resulted in the prohibition of a\r\nnumber of writings upon the questions. The most important of these was\r\nthe _Amor poenitens_ by Johannes Mercassel, Bishop of Castro,\r\nwhich, after a long series of investigations, was finally condemned in\r\n1690, with a _d.c._\r\n\r\nThe Council of Trent[54] had declared that the perfect repentance\r\nwhich has its motive in the love of God (_contritio caritate\r\nperfecta_) can secure reconciliation with God before the sacrament\r\nof confession may be received, but it does not free the believer from\r\nthe requirement for this sacrament. The instruction says, further, that\r\nthe incomplete repentance, the so-called _attritio_, which arises\r\nfrom a consideration of the shamefulness of the sin or is produced\r\nby a fear of the punishment of hell and which is therefore connected\r\nwith the will to refrain from sin with the hope for forgiveness, can\r\nnot of itself and without the sacrament of confession, bring about a\r\nreconciliation with God. Such a condition in the believer places him,\r\nhowever, by means of the sacrament of confession, in a position to\r\nsecure grace. The doctrines presented in these instructions were, as\r\nabove indicated, the texts for a long series of writings, many of which\r\nfailed to secure with the Index authorities approval as orthodox.\r\n\r\n\r\n=40. Communism and Socialism, 1825–1860.=--The selections from the long\r\nlists of works of those classed as socialists are but inconsiderable\r\nand, as in the case of certain other important divisions of literature,\r\nit is difficult to trace any plan or principle upon which they have\r\nbeen based. Proudhon is distinguished by having his entire series of\r\nworks included in the Index, while of Saint-Simon (†1825) not a single\r\nvolume has been condemned. Of the works of Charles Fourier (1768–1837),\r\none book only has been selected for prohibition, _Le Nouveau Monde,\r\nIndustriel et Sociétaire_, printed in 1829, prohibited in 1835.\r\n\r\nÉtienne Cabet (1788–1856) is represented in the Index by one only of\r\nhis long series of treatises, _Le Vrai Christianisme_, printed in 1846,\r\nprohibited in 1848.\r\n\r\nEsquiros, H. A. (†1876), has, next to Proudhon, the longest list in the\r\nIndex of works belonging to this class. Of these the most important is\r\n_L’Évangile du Peuple_, printed in 1840, prohibited in 1841. This is\r\nfollowed by three socialist tracts entitled _Les Vierges Martyres_,\r\n_Les Vierges Folles_, _Les Vierges Sages_, printed in 1841, prohibited\r\nin 1842.\r\n\r\nFurther titles in this group are:\r\n\r\nConstant, L. A., _La Bible de la Liberté_, printed in 1841, prohibited\r\nin the same year. The author was condemned to imprisonment for his\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nChevé, Ch. Fr., _Le Dernier Mot du Socialisme, par un Catholique_,\r\nprinted in 1848, prohibited in 1852.\r\n\r\n\r\n=41. Magnetism and Spiritualism, 1840–1874.=--From the year 1840,\r\nthe Inquisition published a series of decrees or opinions in regard to\r\nthe theory of animal magnetism, but did not undertake to lay down any\r\nfinal conclusions. Certain expressions of opinion were also given in\r\nregard to the theories grouped under the name of spiritualism, but for\r\nthis subject also there is wanting from the censorship authorities any\r\nauthoritative or final word of counsel. From the long list of writings\r\nby the spiritualists of the time, only about a dozen were formally\r\ncondemned. The list includes:\r\n\r\nKardec, Allan, _Revue Spirite, Journal d’Études Psychologiques_,\r\n1858–1864; _Le Spiritisme à sa plus simple Expression_, printed in\r\n1862, prohibited in 1864; _Le Livre des Esprits_, printed in 1863,\r\nprohibited in 1864.\r\n\r\nGuldenstubbe, L. V., _Positive Pneumatologie_, printed in 1870,\r\nprohibited in 1874.\r\n\r\nUnder magnetism may be noted:\r\n\r\nCahagnet, L. A., _Guide du Magnétiseur; Le Magnétisme\r\nSpiritualiste_.\r\n\r\nWith this group may also be classed the Memoir of Swedenborg by the\r\nProtestant theologian, J. Matter of Strasbourg, _Swedenborg, Sa Vie,\r\nses Écrits et sa Doctrine_, printed in 1863, prohibited in 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\n=42. French Authors, 1835–1884.=--Among the more important of the\r\nbooks by French authors which are represented in the Index during this\r\nhalf-century may be noted the following:\r\n\r\nSégur, Mgr. L. G. de (1881), _La Piété et la Vie Intérieure_,\r\nprinted in 1864, prohibited in 1869. The name of the author is not\r\nrecorded in the Index and it is stated that the omission was due to\r\npersonal consideration for him. Ségur states, in an article printed\r\nin 1860, that the monograph, before being brought into print, had\r\nbeen passed upon with approval by a number of devout scholars. He said\r\nfurther, that seventeen thousand copies had been distributed and that\r\nduring the five years since the publication no criticism concerning it\r\nhad come to him. He yields himself now to the authority of the Holy See\r\nand recalls the work from circulation.\r\n\r\nCloquet, Abbé. This author comes into the Index in 1864, on the ground\r\nof a series of monographs having to do with the subject of indulgences.\r\n\r\nAlletz, P. A. (†1785), _Dictionnaire Portatif des Conciles_, printed in\r\n1758 and reissued in 1822, first prohibited (with a _d.c._) in 1859.\r\n\r\nCaron, L. H., Abbé, _La Vraie Doctrine de la Sainte-Église_, printed in\r\n1852, prohibited in 1856.\r\n\r\nSiguier, Aug., _Christ et le Peuple_, printed in 1835, prohibited in\r\n1836.\r\n\r\nMarne, M. G. de la, _La Religion Défendue contre les Préjugés et la\r\nSuperstition_, printed in 1823, prohibited in 1843.\r\n\r\nQuinet, Edgar (1803–1875), _Ahasuérus_, printed in 1833, prohibited\r\nin 1835; _La Génie de Religion_, printed in 1842, prohibited in 1844;\r\n_L’Allemagne et l’Italie_, printed in 1839, prohibited in 1848; _La\r\nRévolution_, printed in 1865, prohibited in 1866.\r\n\r\nMichelet, J., _Mémoires de Luther_ (a translation from the German),\r\nprinted in 1835, prohibited in 1840; _Du Prêtre_, _De la Femme_, _De\r\nla Famille_, _L’Amour_, _La Sorcière_, _La Bible_, _De l’Humanité_,\r\nprinted between 1845 and 1864, prohibited promptly after publication.\r\n\r\nMickiewicz, Adam (1798–1855), _L’Église Officielle et le Messianisme_,\r\nprinted in 1843, prohibited in 1848.\r\n\r\nRenan, E. The writings of this author ought properly to have come into\r\nthe Index under the specification _Opera omnia_. The Congregation\r\nappears to have taken prompt action concerning each book as soon as\r\ninformation of the publication came to hand, but a few titles escaped\r\nattention. The more important of those recorded are the following: _Le\r\nLivre de Job_, _Étude d’Histoire Religieuse_, _Origine du Langage_,\r\n_Histoire des Langues Sémitiques_, _Averroés et l’Averroisme_, _Vie de\r\nJésus_, _L’Antéchrist_, _Les Évangiles_, _La Mort de Jésus_. (These\r\nbooks appeared between the years 1858 and 1884.)\r\n\r\nPêyrat, Alphonse, _Histoire Élémentaire de Jésus_, printed in 1864,\r\nprohibited the same year.\r\n\r\nSoury, Jules, _Jésus et les Évangiles_, printed 1878, prohibited 1878.\r\n\r\nScholl, _Le Procès de Jésus_, printed in 1878, prohibited 1878.\r\n\r\nHavet, E., _Le Christianisme et ses Origines_, printed 1873, prohibited\r\n1878.\r\n\r\nAube, B., _Histoire des Persécutions de l’Église_; _Histoire de\r\nl’Église_; _La Polémique Paienne à la fin du deuxième siècle_; _Le\r\nChristianisme dans l’Empire Romain_, printed 1876–1880, prohibited as\r\npublished.\r\n\r\nLarroque, P., _Examen des Doctrines de la Religion Chrétienne_;\r\n_L’Esclavage chez les Nations Chrétiennes_, printed in 1859–1864,\r\nprohibited as published. Later writings by this author were also placed\r\non the Index, apparently in so far as their titles were brought to the\r\nattention of the Congregation.\r\n\r\nJacolliot, L., _La Bible dans l’Inde_; _Vie de Jezeus Chrishna_, an\r\nidentification of Christ with the Chrishna of the Hindus, printed in\r\n1869, prohibited the same year. A group of later writings by this\r\nauthor were also promptly condemned.\r\n\r\nRodrigues, H., _Les trois Filles de la Bible_, printed in 1865; _Les\r\nOrigines du Sermon de la Montagne_, printed in 1868; _La Justice de\r\nDieu_, printed in 1869; _Histoire du Premier Christianisme_, printed\r\nin 1873. The above books were prohibited together in 1877 with the\r\nspecification: “these works are condemned in accordance with the\r\nConstitution of Clement VIII, issued in 1592, on the ground of their\r\npresenting Jewish writings which contain heresies and errors tending to\r\nundermine Christian doctrine.”\r\n\r\nLajollais, Mlle. Nathalie de, _Le Lime des Mères des Families sur\r\nl’Éducation Pratique des Femmes_, printed in 1845, prohibited (with a\r\n_d.c._) in 1846.\r\n\r\nGréville, Mme. Henri, _Instruction Morale et Civile des Jeunes Filles_,\r\nprinted in 1882, prohibited the same year.\r\n\r\nBert, Paul, _L’Instruction Civile à l’École_, printed in 1883,\r\nprohibited the same year. The volume of Bert had been officially\r\nadopted for use in the schools of Paris and also in certain other\r\nof the large cities. The decree of the Index was published by the\r\nArchbishop of Albi and by the Bishops of Annécy, Viviers, Langres,\r\nand Valence. The ecclesiastical authorities were sharply reproved by\r\nthe magistracy for their interference in the matter and for their\r\nundertaking to criticise the action of the Government in a matter\r\nwhich, as it was claimed, belonged to the temporalities. In May, 1883,\r\nMinister Ferry, speaking in the Senate, says:\r\n\r\n   “We will never recognise as binding in a matter of this kind\r\n   the conclusions or judgments of the Congregation of the Index.\r\n   We propose to maintain free from interference the Gallican and\r\n   the French tradition of the independence of the civil power. How\r\n   is it possible to conceive that a Frenchman would be prepared\r\n   to accept conclusions of a body like the Congregation which has\r\n   in past years seen fit to condemn and to attempt to repress\r\n   great spirits of humanity like Descartes, Malebranche, Kant,\r\n   Renan, Bouillet?... I understand that a manual by Compayré was\r\n   condemned because the author says that it is more important for\r\n   a child to know the names of the Kings of France than those of\r\n   the Kings of Judea.... This Index decree is sent out over the\r\n   heads of our ambassador in Rome and of the Papal Nuncio in Paris\r\n   in such manner as to arouse needless antagonism in France.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=43. Italian Writings, 1840–1876.=--Of the works by Italian authors\r\ncondemned during this period, the following may be noted as indicating\r\nthe policy of the Congregation.\r\n\r\nLazzeretti, David, _Opuscula omnia quocumque Idiomate edita_, printed\r\nin 1876, prohibited in 1878. Lazzeretti represented a mystic school of\r\nthought. He had for a time been in favour with Pius IX.\r\n\r\nGravina, D. B., _Su l’Origine dell’ Anima_, printed in 1870,\r\nprohibited in 1875.\r\n\r\nNuytz, G. N., _Juris ecclesiastici Institutiones_, printed in\r\n1844, prohibited in 1851. In this condemnation, the critics have\r\ntaken the pains to specify certain propositions which are considered\r\npernicious.\r\n\r\nZobi, Ant., _Storia civile della Toscana_, 1737–1848, prohibited in\r\n1856.\r\n\r\nAmari, Mich., _Storia dei Musulmani in Sicilia_, volume one, printed in\r\n1845, prohibited in the same year. The following volumes of this work\r\nescaped condemnation.\r\n\r\nRusconi, Carlo, _La Repubblica Romana del 1849_, printed in 1849,\r\nprohibited in 1850.\r\n\r\nLeva, Jus. de, _I Jesuiti e la Repubblica di Venezia_, printed in\r\n1866, prohibited in 1873.\r\n\r\nCantu, E., _Storia Universale_, printed in 1858, prohibited in 1860.\r\n\r\nTorti, Giov., _Un Abisso in Roma_, printed in 1864, prohibited (by\r\nthe Inquisition) in 1865.\r\n\r\n\r\n=44. American Writings, 1822–1876.=--The first work by an American\r\nauthor which finds place in the Index is a monograph by W. Hogan,\r\na priest in Philadelphia, having to do with a controversy that had\r\narisen concerning the Church of Saint Mary which Bishop Henry Conwell\r\nproposed to have consecrated as a cathedral. The action of the Bishop\r\nwas contested in some fashion by the trustees acting on behalf of Hogan\r\nwho wanted to retain his pastorate. Hogan’s pamphlet was condemned\r\nin 1822. Hogan finally gave up the contest and at the same time left\r\nthe Catholic Church and married. In 1864, was placed upon the Index\r\na translation, printed in New York, of a monograph by Fr. Hollick,\r\nentitled _Guia de los Cassados o Historia Natural de la Generacion_.\r\n\r\nDraper, J. W., _History of the Conflict between Religion and Science_,\r\nprinted (in New York) in 1874, prohibited (in a Spanish version) in\r\n1876.\r\n\r\nCanada is represented in the Index of this period by the titles of\r\ntwo year-books issued by a literary association in Montreal, which,\r\nprinted in 1858–9, were prohibited in 1864. In the year 1858, at which\r\ntime the association contained seven hundred members, a proposition,\r\nsubmitted at the instance of certain ecclesiastics in the membership,\r\nwas brought up for consideration, under which all non-Catholic members\r\nwere to be excluded and two Protestant journals were to be removed\r\nfrom the reading-room. This proposal was voted down, and on that\r\nground and also on the further complaint that the library contained\r\npernicious literature, the Catholic members were called upon to leave\r\nthe association. One hundred and fifty left and instituted a Catholic\r\nFrench-Canadian institute. The majority of the original association\r\nissued a statement declaring that the library contained no unworthy\r\nbooks and that, in any case, the decision concerning its literature\r\nrested with the managers of the association. In April, 1858, Bishop\r\nBourget issued a pastoral brief in which he reminded the members of\r\nthe old association that the reading or possession of heretical books\r\ninvolved the penalty of excommunication, and that any books recorded in\r\nthe Index were to be classed as heretical. The institute was instructed\r\nto recall its action, and if it refused, the Catholic members were\r\nordered to resign, under penalty of excommunication. Two hundred\r\nCatholics disregarded the command of the Bishop and remained members.\r\nThey explained that they did not assert the right to read forbidden\r\nbooks, but they did maintain their right to remain members of a society\r\nin whose collections such books might be contained. In 1864, these\r\nCatholic members took the pains to place before the Bishop a catalogue\r\nof the library with the request that he would indicate the books\r\nclassed as pernicious and with the suggestion that these books should\r\nbe placed in a separate collection. To this proposition the Bishop paid\r\nno attention, whereupon seventeen of the members made direct appeal to\r\nPope Pius IX. From the Pope they received no reply, but in July, 1869,\r\nthe Bishop, then in Rome, sent to Montreal a pastoral brief in which\r\nhe reported that the Inquisition declared the work of the institution\r\nto be pernicious. He reported, further, that the annual volume of the\r\nCanadian institute for 1868 (in which volume were contained certain\r\naddresses on toleration and freedom of conscience) had been condemned\r\nand that any person possessing or reading this year-book or remaining\r\nin the institute had come into mortal sin and must be refused the\r\nsacraments. Later in the year, a second memorial was addressed to the\r\nprefect of the Propaganda by the Catholic members of the institute, in\r\nwhich they stated that they accepted without question the condemnation\r\nof the year-book. To this memorial no reply was received. The Bishop,\r\nhowever, declared in a report to the vicar-general that the submission\r\nrendered in this memorial was inadequate because the writers remained\r\nmembers of an institute in which was maintained the righteousness of\r\nreligious toleration. In November, 1869, died a distinguished Catholic\r\nmember of the institute named Guibord, a man whose life had been above\r\nreproach. The pastor and the other authorities refused to make burial\r\nof the body even without religious ceremonies. The widow secured a\r\nprovisional interment in unconsecrated ground. She then instituted a\r\nsuit demanding the right of burial in consecrated ground. The suit\r\ncontinued until after her death in 1873. In November, 1874, the\r\njudicial committee of the priory council in London decided that the\r\nbody was entitled to burial in the consecrated ground of his pastoral\r\nchurch and decided further that the Church authorities must provide for\r\nthe very considerable expenses of the suit. The re-burial took place\r\nin November, 1875, after the Church authorities had filed a protest\r\nand had ordered faithful Catholics to take no part in the ceremonies.\r\nThe record is of value in the history of censorship proceedings as an\r\nexample of the overriding by the authority of the State of a decision\r\nof the Church, in regard to a matter which had heretofore been held\r\nas belonging strictly within ecclesiastical control, namely the right\r\nof burial in consecrated ground. In 1870, a later annual giving\r\nthe record of the conclusion of the process, was condemned by the\r\nInquisition.[55]\r\n\r\nThe contributions to the Index from the literature of South America are\r\nfor this period more considerable than those from the United States and\r\nCanada. The following titles indicate the direction of the censorship.\r\n\r\nVidaurre, Manuel Lorenzo de, _Proyecto del codigo eclesiastico_,\r\nprinted (in Paris) in 1830, condemned in 1833. The author, a doctor\r\nof law of the University of Lima, was Chief Justice of the Supreme\r\nCourt of Peru. His “project” proposed certain rather radical changes\r\nin ecclesiastical regulations. _Tratado sobre Denaciones_, printed (in\r\nMadrid) in 1820, prohibited in 1833. In the same year were placed upon\r\nthe Index three monographs by Vidaurre, one on the Bishop of Rome and\r\nthe condition of the Church, the second on Celibacy, and the third on\r\nConfession.\r\n\r\nVigil, Francisco P. G. de, _Defensa de la Autoridad de los Gobiernos\r\ny de los Obispos contra las Pretenciones de la Curia Romana_, printed\r\n(in Lima) in 1848, prohibited in 1851. The author was a priest and at\r\nthe time of his death Curator of the National Museum at Lima. The work,\r\nissued in six volumes, octavo, gives consideration to almost every\r\ndetail of the organisation of the Church. _Manual de Derecho Publico\r\nEclesiastico, and Dialogos sobre la Existencia de Dios y la Vida\r\nfutura, á la Juventud Americana_, printed (in Lima) in 1863, prohibited\r\nin 1864. Vigil died in June, 1875. He had declined to submit himself to\r\nthe condemnation of the Church and he was therefore refused the last\r\nsacraments. The Congress of Peru directed, however, that he should have\r\nthe honour of a public funeral.\r\n\r\nLa Riva, J. F., _El Espiritu del Evangelio comparado con las Practicas\r\nde la Iglesia Catolica_, printed (in Lima) in 1867, prohibited in the\r\nsame year.\r\n\r\nFotvárad, Carlos H. de, _O Casamento civil_, etc., printed (in\r\nRio Janeiro) in 1858, prohibited in 1859. This monograph was written\r\nin reply to a treatise, published in Rio in 1858, by Canon de Campo.\r\nThe author undertook to maintain the exclusive authority of the Church\r\n(as against the State) in all matters connected with marriage. _Las\r\nBiblias falsificadas_, etc., printed (in Rio) in 1867, prohibited in\r\n1869. This was a further criticism of the utterances of de Campo.\r\n\r\nD’Aranjo, M. R. (Bishop of Rio), _Elementos dé direito Eclesiastico\r\npublico_, etc., printed (in Rio) in 1857, prohibited in 1869.\r\n_Compendio de Theologia Moral_, printed (in Oporto) in 1858, prohibited\r\nin 1869.\r\n\r\nMonte, Carmelo J. de, _O Brazil Mystificado na Questao religiosa_,\r\nprinted in 1875, prohibited in 1876.\r\n\r\nMexico is represented in the Index of the period by a treatise entitled\r\n_Conducta_, the work of D. J. C. Portugal, Bishop of Michoachon,\r\nprinted (in Mexico) in 1835, prohibited in 1840; and by two treatises\r\nof N. Pizarro, _Catecismo Politico Constitutional_, and _Catecismo de\r\nMoral_, printed in 1867, prohibited in 1869.\r\n\r\n\r\n=45. Periodicals, 1832–1900.=--In 1832, the Congregation of the\r\nIndex issued a declaration stating that the regulations of the Index\r\nof Trent (renewed in the succeeding Indexes) concerning ecclesiastical\r\ncensorship, covered material printed in journals as well as that\r\npublished in books. After the year 1848, however, the attempt to\r\nenforce in Rome ecclesiastical censorship, over the contents of\r\njournals as given up was impracticable. It was pointed out that no\r\nadvantage could be secured in placing upon the Index journal issues of\r\na back date, the reading of which had already been completed.\r\n\r\nDuring the 18th century, however, various attempts were made to\r\ncontrol the literary policy of journals the managers of which were\r\nwithin reach of ecclesiastical authority, and during the 19th century,\r\ncensorship decrees were issued in regard to a number of journals which\r\nconcerned themselves with ecclesiastical subjects. The only practicable\r\nmeasure to take against journals the articles in which are judged to\r\nbe pernicious in their influence is to prohibit the faithful from\r\nreading or from possessing copies of the same. It has, however, been\r\nfound convenient, in the cases in which such prohibitions appeared\r\nto be called for, to have the same issued and enforced, not by the\r\nCongregation, but by the local authorities.\r\n\r\nAfter 1850, the Minister of the Interior in the papal States printed\r\nlists of the foreign journals the reading of which was forbidden.\r\n\r\n1862. December. Adames, Apostolic Vicar of Luxemburg, declared in a\r\npastoral letter that the publisher of the _Courier de Luxemburg_ and\r\nhis editors were excommunicated. The subscribers and readers of the\r\njournal were to be excluded from the sacraments on the ground that they\r\nwere helping to support a work of Satan. The publisher took the matter\r\ninto the courts, but the judges dismissed the complaint against Adames,\r\ntaking the ground that his action was within his ecclesiastical and\r\nlegal rights. (Vering, _Archiv_, X, 422, XII, 172.)\r\n\r\nIn 1863, the Patriarch of Venice and the ten Venetian bishops, in a\r\npastoral letter, prohibited the reading of three journals specified.\r\n\r\n1870. Melchers, Archbishop of Cologne, published an instruction\r\nagainst the _Rheinische Merkur_, with which instruction the Bishop of\r\nMayence and the Capitular-Vicar of Münster concurred. The Bishop of\r\nPaderborn issued an edict forbidding, as a mortal sin, the possession\r\nof a copy of the journal. No action appears to have been taken by the\r\npublishers, possibly because the circulation of the _Merkur_ was not\r\nseriously affected by these episcopal fulminations.\r\n\r\n1871. Under instructions of Pius IX, a circular letter was issued by\r\nCardinal Vicar Patrizzi to the pastors or parish priests directing\r\nthem to forbid to their parishioners the reading of certain Roman\r\njournals. The list included _La Libertà_, _Il Capital_, _Il Tempo_,\r\n_La nuova Roma_, _La Vita Nuova_, and six others. Disobedience to this\r\norder was to be classed as a grievous sin. In 1873, a papal brief gave\r\ncertain general instructions in regard to journals. It pointed out\r\nthat these were covered by rules 2 and 7 of the Index. Papers were to\r\nbe considered sheet by sheet, simply as open books. Permission might\r\nbe accorded to a person to whom the information was necessary, to read\r\nin heretical or dangerous papers the political or financial articles,\r\nbut the permission should be strictly limited to these portions of the\r\njournal.\r\n\r\nIn 1882, September, the Patriarch of Venice prohibited in like manner\r\nthe reading of _Il Veneto Christiano_, and of _Fra Paolo Sarpi_, as\r\n“godless, blasphemous, and heretical productions.” The Patriarch\r\ndeclared that the publisher and those who read these journals with\r\nbelief were excommunicated.\r\n\r\n1885. February. The Archbishop Magnasco, of Geneva, condemned the\r\n_Epoca_. Editor, publisher, distributor, and readers were alike\r\ncondemned to excommunication. Whoever buys or reads a number, or gives\r\nit to another, has committed mortal sin.\r\n\r\n\r\n=46. The Roman Question, 1859–1870.=--Between the years 1859–1861,\r\na number of monographs and volumes, chiefly by French writers, were\r\nbrought into print that had to do with the question of the political\r\nauthority of the Papacy. These French theories brought out a full\r\nmeasure of criticism and condemnation. Among the works thus reproved\r\nwas a treatise by La Guérronnière, _La France, Rome et l’Italie_,\r\nprinted in 1861, in regard to which Cardinal Antonelli issued a\r\nspecific condemnation. No single title of the group is, however, to\r\nbe found in the Index. The monograph by La Guérronnière expressed, as\r\nwas well understood, the views of the Emperor Napoleon III, and had\r\nprobably been written at the Emperor’s suggestion. A companion volume\r\nwas published about the same time by Edmund About and this also was\r\nsharply condemned not only by Cardinal Antonelli but also by a number\r\nof the French bishops, including Dupanloup. The list of the Italian\r\ncontroversial publications on this question is also considerable. The\r\nearlier works had to do simply with the political authority of the\r\npope, but since 1870, a number of writers have given attention to the\r\ndesirability, on the ground of the welfare of Italy and also of that\r\nof the Church universal, of the reconciliation of the Papacy with the\r\nGovernment of the United Italy. These writings were met with sharp\r\ncondemnation on the part of Pius IX and Leo XIII and of the supporters\r\nof the civil authority of the Papacy, but in only few instances was\r\naction taken in regard to them by the Congregation of the Index.\r\n\r\n\r\n=47. The Council of the Vatican, 1867–1876.=--The conclusions reached\r\nby the council held in the Vatican in 1867 resulted in the publication\r\nof a number of controversial works of which certain titles found their\r\nway into the Index. The more important of these are the following:\r\n\r\nMichelis, Fr., _Fünfzig Thesen über die Gestaltung der kirchlichen\r\nVerhältnisse der Gegenwart_, printed in 1867, condemned in 1868.\r\n\r\nRenouf, Le Page, _La Condamnation du Pape Honorius_, printed in\r\n1868, prohibited in the same year.\r\n\r\n“Janus” (the name adopted for the moment by Döllinger) _Der Papst und\r\ndas Concilium_, printed in 1869, prohibited in the same year.\r\n\r\nWallon, Jean, _La Vérité sur le Concile_, printed in 1872, prohibited\r\nin 1873.\r\n\r\nDupanloup, Archbishop, _Testament Spirituel de Montalembert_, and _La\r\nCour de Rome et la France_, printed in 1871, prohibited in 1872.\r\n\r\nPressensé, _Le Concile du Vatican_, printed in 1872, prohibited in 1876.\r\n\r\nIn 1870, the general Congregation published a protest, signed by a\r\nnumber of members of the council, calling for the specific condemnation\r\nof a series of newspapers, articles, and pamphlets in which the work\r\nof the council had been criticised. The secretary of the Congregation\r\nof the Index reported, however, that it did not seem wise to take\r\naction. During the years 1871 and 1872, were, however, condemned by\r\nthe Inquisition a number of periodical articles on the work of the\r\ncouncil by such authors as Lord Acton, Berchtold, Friedrich, Ruckgaber,\r\nSchulte, Zirngiebl, and others.\r\n\r\n\r\n=48. Example of a License.=--A license given by the inquisitor-general\r\nof Spain to Dr. Andrew Sall in June, 1652, states that he was\r\npermitted to keep and to read prohibited books for use in connection\r\nwith the writing of any doctrinal or devotional books or treatises.\r\nThe holder of the license was charged with the duty of giving\r\ninformation to his Grace of any censurable propositions that he might\r\nfind in books, ancient or modern, which might not already have been\r\ncomprehended in the expurgatory Index. The license was marked as\r\nduly entered in the record of licenses, the page (Number 138) giving\r\nindication of a considerable series of licenses outstanding. These\r\ninstruments were renewed from year to year. Dr. Sall relates that with\r\nthe second grant came a complaint that he had reported no censurable\r\npropositions. He had excused himself by saying that he had not had\r\nin his hands any Protestant books; but he gave specification of some\r\nperverse and apparently heretical doctrines he had found in certain\r\nbooks which were approved and were much in use with themselves. He gave\r\nas an example citations from the Commentaries on Esther by de Murcia:\r\n\r\n_Etiam Deus Op. Max. proposita ante oculos morte in meliora contendat_;\r\nand\r\n\r\n_Etiam demon morte ante oculos constituta contendit in meliora_.[56]\r\n\r\nSleumer gives the following example of the form in force to-day (1906)\r\nfor an application for the permission to read forbidden books.\r\n\r\n“To the very reverend Vicar-General of the diocese: The undersigned\r\nrespectfully request permission for the reading of certain books which\r\nhave been specifically forbidden in the Index or which in their class\r\ncome under the general provisions of the Index. The requirement is\r\nbased upon the following grounds:...\r\n\r\n“The undersigned feels assured that the proposed use of this forbidden\r\nliterature may be made by him on these grounds without any undermining\r\nof his faith or any interference with his conscientious duty to the\r\nHoly Church.”[57]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n             THE CENSORSHIP OF THE STATE AND CENSORSHIP BY\r\n                              PROTESTANTS\r\n\r\n   1. General.\r\n\r\n   2. Catholic States: Catholic Germany, France, Spain and Portugal.\r\n\r\n   3. Protestant States: Switzerland, Protestant Germany, Holland,\r\n        Scandinavia, England.\r\n\r\n   4. Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\n=1. General.=--In this chapter, I am undertaking to present, not\r\nany comprehensive summary of political censorship, a task which would\r\nin fact require many volumes, but merely certain noteworthy examples of\r\nregulations issued under civil authority which will serve to indicate\r\nthe general character of the censorship supervision of literature that\r\nwas attempted by the State.\r\n\r\nI have grouped together here instances of Catholic censorship in which\r\nthe ecclesiastics carried out their prohibitions under the authority\r\nof the State, or in which the State censorship regulations had been\r\nput into shape by the ecclesiastics. In the record of the so-called\r\nProtestant censorship, that is to say of the regulations adopted\r\nin Protestant States for the control of theological or religious\r\nliterature, it is not practicable to separate the acts and utterances\r\nof the theologians from those emanating from the civil authorities,\r\nwhether municipal or national. The larger number of the prohibitions\r\nof books having to do with theology or religion were naturally\r\ninitiated by the divines, although even for this class of literature\r\nthe civil authorities frequently did not hesitate to take into their\r\nown hands the responsibility of selecting the works to be condemned.\r\n\r\nThe chief distinction, however, between the censorship methods of\r\nProtestant communities and those which came into force in Catholic\r\nStates was the fact that for the former the censorship authorities\r\nwere dependent for the enforcement of the prohibitions and penalties\r\nupon the machinery of the civil authority. The Protestant divines had\r\nat their command no such dread penalty as the ban of excommunication\r\nby means of which the Catholic ecclesiastics were able to enforce upon\r\nthe faithful obedience to the commands of the Church. In the Protestant\r\nStates, it was necessary for the divines, first, to convince the rulers\r\nof the essential importance of their particular creeds or forms of\r\n“orthodoxy,” in order to secure the enactment of the necessary laws or\r\nthe issue of censorship edicts; and, secondly, to keep the magistrates\r\nup to the mark in the enforcing of the penalties prescribed.\r\n\r\nIt is true that in Catholic States, such as France, Austria, or\r\nBavaria, the authority of the Crown and the machinery of the civil\r\npower were frequently utilised to carry out censorship regulations\r\nthat had been framed by the ecclesiastics; but even with the citizens\r\nof those States (as far at least as they were Catholics) the most\r\npertinent influence in insuring obedience for the prohibitions of the\r\nIndex was the dread of being deprived of the rites of the Church.\r\nExcommunication meant that the adults were prohibited from marriage\r\nand their children were deprived of baptism; it meant that for the\r\nliving there was no communion, for the dying, no absolution, and for\r\nthe dead, no burial in consecrated ground. Life without the sacraments\r\nwas full of fears, and with the deprival of absolution and of Church\r\nburial, death took on new terrors. These same influences were, of\r\ncourse, all-important also in securing the active co-operation even of\r\nthe most worldly and most skeptical of the civil rulers in creating\r\nand in maintaining the machinery for controlling the operations of the\r\nprinters and booksellers and for enforcing adequate civil or criminal\r\npenalties against heretical delinquents who were not amenable to the\r\nauthority of the Church.\r\n\r\nIn the States in which in this fashion the co-operation of Catholic\r\nrulers could be secured in support of the censorship policy of the\r\nChurch universal, the administration of such censorship was, of course,\r\nmore consistent, and it is fair to say less arbitrary (at least outside\r\nof Spain) than in the Protestant States in which the principles\r\nof prohibition changed from decade to decade with the changes of\r\nadministration or as one theological faction or another secured\r\ninfluence with the rulers.\r\n\r\nIn 1904, the Jesuit Father, Joseph Hilgers, published, under the title\r\n_Der Index der verbotenen Bücher_, a treatise presenting, from\r\nthe point of view of an earnest upholder of the authority of the Roman\r\nChurch, an historical study of the Roman Index. The immediate text\r\nfor the production of this treatise of the learned Father was the\r\npublication, in 1900, of the second Index of Leo XIII, of which Index\r\nthe Father gives a comprehensive description and analysis. Father\r\nHilgers takes the ground that it was impossible for the Church, without\r\nneglecting its manifest duty, to avoid accepting the responsibility\r\nfor the supervision and control of literary production and of the\r\nreading of the faithful. The pope, says the Father, is, as the head of\r\nthe Church on earth, the direct representative of God. It is through\r\nhim that God makes known his wishes and the principles upon which the\r\nlife of the faithful is to be guided. It is for the shepherd of the\r\nflock to preserve the flock from poison. The shepherd is charged not\r\nmerely with the right living of his sheep during their earthly career,\r\nbut with the much larger responsibility of seeing that their lives are\r\nso shaped that they shall secure a blessed hereafter.\r\n\r\nIn the historical sketch of the operations of the Index, Hilgers\r\ntouches but lightly upon the examples of inconsistencies or\r\ndifficulties in the enforcement by the Church of the control over\r\nliterature. He makes no mention of the many contests that arose\r\nbetween the different ecclesiastical bodies. He hardly touches upon\r\nthe fact that the Index came to be from time to time an expression\r\nof theological differences between the great Church bodies or Orders\r\nsuch as, for instance, the Jesuits and the Dominicans or the Jesuits\r\nand the Franciscans. He has nothing to say about the instances in\r\nwhich the utterances of successive popes came into conflict with each\r\nother. He also barely makes mention of the contentions, maintained in\r\nSpain as in France, of the right of the national Church, acting in\r\nco-operation with the national Government, to decide what principles\r\nshould be maintained for the supervision of the literature of the\r\nnation. His big treatise, comprehensive in many respects, is very\r\ncurious in its omissions. In dwelling upon the beneficent influence of\r\nthis Church censorship, he omits altogether the record of the control\r\nof this censorship by the Inquisition in Spain. He has nothing to say\r\nabout the imprisonment or execution of Spanish heretics whose crime\r\nhad consisted in the production, the selling, or the reading of books\r\nclassed as heretical. If the reader had no other knowledge of the Index\r\nthan that which came to him by the history as presented by Hilgers, he\r\nwould have before him simply a record of an administration of fatherly\r\nbeneficence on the part of wise advisers, of a pleading with the\r\nperverse that they should be saved from the consequences of their own\r\nperversity; of actions furthering all scholarship that was in itself\r\nwholesome and sound, and of the discouragement simply of such perverted\r\nintellectual efforts as tended to lead men away from their duty to\r\ntheir Creator and to undermine the moral conduct of their own lives.\r\n\r\nHilgers is not prepared to admit that any of the works repressed by\r\nthe Church, or the repression of which was undertaken by the Church,\r\ncould have constituted, if permitted free circulation, or do actually\r\nconstitute as far as, in spite of the opposition of the Church, they\r\nsecure such circulation, any additions of value to the intellectual\r\nlife of mankind. He would probably, if the question had been put to\r\nhim directly, have taken the ground that no intellectual gain could\r\nsufficiently offset the moral or spiritual loss. In maintaining the\r\ncontention that any properly ruled community must accept a supervision\r\nof its literary activities, he naturally lays stress upon the long\r\nseries of censorship systems which were undertaken by ecclesiastics\r\nor by the civil rulers of Protestant States. He calls attention to\r\nthe series of so-called Protestant (theological) Indexes, and he\r\nadds a very considerable list of instances of political censorship.\r\nHe is able to point out that the number of books which have come\r\nunder condemnation through this Protestant censorship (including the\r\ncensorship undertaken directly by the civil authorities) very much\r\nexceeds the books condemned in the whole series of Roman Indexes,\r\nalthough in this comparison he omits all Indexes which came into\r\npublication outside of Rome.\r\n\r\nHe does not take pains to present any results of the effectiveness of\r\nthese Protestant Indexes. In omitting the record of the censorship\r\nof the Spanish Inquisition, he is able to avoid any reference to the\r\nfact that the censorship machinery put into force by the Inquisition\r\nwas, for the territory controlled by it, thoroughly effective; so that\r\nif a book was condemned in Spain, it was the case, for the centuries\r\nin question, that, as far as Spanish territory was concerned, the\r\neditions were thoroughly suppressed and the production or distribution\r\nof copies was rendered impossible. He speaks of each of the censorship\r\nedicts of the German States as if they had effect throughout the whole\r\nof the territory of Germany. He omits to point out that the books\r\ncondemned in one city or in one State promptly came into print and into\r\ncirculation in adjacent territory in such manner that the circulation\r\nwas practically unchecked.\r\n\r\nHe is able, however, fairly to make out his main contention, that for\r\nthe century succeeding the Protestant Reformation, the will or desire\r\non the part of the Protestants to establish a censorship of literature\r\nwas just as emphatic as that of the authorities of Rome; and that if\r\ntheir efforts were only partially successful, it was through no want\r\nof conviction on their part that such efforts were required for the\r\nmaintenance of what they considered to be the true Faith. He is able\r\nto make good the further contention that these examples of Protestant\r\ncensorship present a much larger series of inconsistencies than could\r\nbe found in the record of the Index of the Church of Rome; even though\r\none should for the purpose of the comparison include under the Church\r\nIndex, in addition to those printed in Rome, the Indexes that emanated\r\nfrom Madrid, Louvain, and Paris. He also makes his point good in regard\r\nto the political Index. He is able to show that, as far at least as\r\nthe edicts of the State were concerned, these were more bitter, more\r\ncomprehensive, and more regardless of literary interests than those of\r\nthe Church. What he does not emphasise is that these political edicts\r\nwere very much more spasmodic and temporary in their influence, and\r\nthat, as a fact, they had very little continued effect on the literary\r\ndevelopment of the communities which were responsible for them.\r\n\r\nA political censorship becomes of necessity the football of political\r\nparties and is therefore not to be maintained with any measure of\r\nconsistency or justice. The multiplicity and changeableness of the\r\nreligious doctrines of the reformers gave to the so-called Protestant\r\ncensorship an inconsistent and contradictory character which is not\r\nto be paralleled under any epoch of Roman supervision of literature.\r\nA censorship of this kind is the natural product of the fissure of\r\ncreeds. Hermann Wagener, writing in Berlin in 1864, remarks that all\r\nthe measures of the State thus far attempted to protect the public\r\nagainst pernicious influences from the printing-press, are open to\r\nthe criticism that their action is purely negative. On the other\r\nhand, as he points out, the censorship policy of the Catholic Church,\r\nwhile on the one hand prohibitory, on the other asserts positive and\r\nconstructive principles for the literary and intellectual development\r\nof the community by wholesome and wise methods.\r\n\r\nIt is true, says Hilgers, that the works of great writers like Tasso,\r\nMolière, Châteaubriand, Vondel, Goethe, Schiller, Grotius, and other\r\nleaders of thought have come under the ban of censorship and that the\r\npublication or use of their works had been permitted only after certain\r\neliminations or purgations had been made. The censorship regulations\r\nin regard to these authors emanated however not from Rome but from\r\nthe authorities of France, Holland, Germany, and Denmark. It was the\r\ncase even with _Faust_ that its production could not be permitted\r\non the stage of Berlin until certain “dangerous” passages had been\r\neliminated.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Catholic Germany]\r\n\r\n=2. Catholic States.=--The Edict of Worms of 1521, which committed\r\nthe Emperor Charles V to the support of the contentions of the Papacy,\r\nand threw the great weight of the Holy Roman Empire against the cause\r\nof the Protestant reformers, constituted the beginning of an imperial\r\ncensorship, a censorship which was confirmed and extended by the Edict\r\nof Nuremberg of 1524. In the regions under Lutheran influence, the only\r\neffect of the imperial and ecclesiastical prohibition was, as noted,\r\nto increase largely the circulation of the writings of the reformers.\r\nIn the districts into which the reform doctrines had only begun to\r\npenetrate, the ecclesiastics were able, in great part at least, to stop\r\nthe further circulation of the pamphlets, by taking prompt and harsh\r\nmeasures against the colporteurs. From this time and until the close\r\nof the Thirty Years’ War, Church and State (the imperial State) worked\r\ntogether (although not always in harmony) against the freedom of the\r\npress, on the broad ground that such freedom necessarily resulted in\r\nheresy and in treason. In 1529, the persecution of the printers and\r\nof the Protestants in Austria was for the time relaxed because of the\r\nperil of Vienna from the Turks, an exigency which absorbed the full\r\nattention of the imperial authorities.\r\n\r\nThe Church and the Holy Roman Emperor finally took the ground that\r\nevery writing that came from the pen of a Protestant author, even\r\nthough it had nothing whatsoever to do with religion or politics,\r\nmust be classed as libellous. In 1548, the Emperor issued a new\r\nseries of most strenuous laws for the control of the press. The\r\npenalties were brought to bear at one point or another with full\r\nseverity, but it proved to be impracticable to secure in the Germany\r\nof the time any uniformity of obedience. In Austria and in Bavaria,\r\nthe penalties included the use of the rack for authors, printers,\r\nand sellers of publications that came under condemnation. In 1567,\r\na _Flugschrift_ was printed in Frankfort under the title of\r\n_Nachtigall_, which was at once interpreted as a libel on the\r\nEmperor. Fourteen hundred copies were sold within a few hours of its\r\nissue and there were various reprints within the next few weeks. The\r\nEmperor ordered the punishment not only of the printer, but of the\r\nmagistrates of Frankfort. The former was placed in prison for two years\r\nand the magistrates were fined thirty thousand gulden, an enormous sum\r\nfor those days.[58]\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Ferdinand was a more faithful, that is to say, a more\r\nbigoted, son of the Church than Charles, but he refused to admit that\r\nthe control of the press was a Church matter. He took the ground that\r\ncensorship was a matter pertaining to the State, that is, to the Crown,\r\nand that the bishops could take part in it only as delegates of the\r\nauthority of the State. This was the contention asserted, and finally\r\nmaintained, in France by Francis I and his successors.\r\n\r\nIn an official document of 1580, occurs the phrase, “The regulation of\r\nbooks (_das Bücher-regal_) which has for many years been within\r\nthe control of the emperor.” Schurmann is of opinion that the authority\r\nfor the regulation of books was derived from, or connected with, the\r\nrights reserved to the imperial authority under the Golden Bull. A\r\ncentury after the issue of the Golden Bull, at the time namely of the\r\ninvention of printing, the reserved powers (_Reserva-rechte_) of\r\nthe empire had become materially weakened, and were being in large part\r\nexercised by the local authorities, and the attempt of the emperor to\r\nenforce control over literary production and distribution was from the\r\noutset met by antagonism and protest on the part of princes and of the\r\nmunicipal magistrates, and was also opposed by the contention of the\r\nChurch that such supervision properly belonged to her. The question\r\nwas raised as to whether the decrees of the imperial Diet contained\r\nany references to the imperial control of book publishing. The\r\nomission was explained on the ground that such control was exercised\r\nas a personal right of the emperor. It was under such imperial\r\nauthority, for instance, that an approval or privilege was given to\r\nthe _Germania_ of Aeneas Sylvius (afterwards Pius II), originally\r\nissued in Italy in 1464 and printed in Germany in 1515.\r\n\r\nIn 1530, there came to Vienna a group of Jesuits who did much to\r\nstrengthen the machinery of censorship. The undertakings of the\r\nprinters and of the booksellers decreased in direct proportion with\r\nthe growth of the influence of the Jesuit advisers of the emperor.\r\nIn 1523, the production and sale throughout the empire of the German\r\nBible is prohibited. In 1564, the Elector of Bavaria orders that the\r\nwork of the publishers must be restricted to printers whose Catholic\r\northodoxy has been duly tested. In this year, the Elector begins the\r\nissue of an annual list of books that were to be permitted. In 1569,\r\nthe use in the schools of Bavaria of certain Latin classics, including\r\nthe works of Virgil, Horace, and Ovid, was prohibited. In 1616, the\r\nElector appointed Catholic commissioners of censorship for each town in\r\nBavaria. The University of Ingolstadt became the centre of the work of\r\nthe Jesuits, who, in Bavaria as in Vienna, had secured the direction of\r\ncensorship.\r\n\r\nIn 1579, under Rudolf II, the Jesuits were called upon to put into\r\nshape a more effective censorship for the empire. Under the régime thus\r\nestablished, the standard of thought for the political action and for\r\nthe religious belief of Germany was to be fixed in Rome and in Madrid.\r\nUnder the direction of the Jesuit censors in the year 1579, no less\r\nthan twelve thousand books in German and two thousand in Bohemian were\r\nburned by the public hangman in the town of Gratz.[59]\r\n\r\nIn the same year, an imperial commission was appointed, with\r\nheadquarters at Frankfort, which was charged with the supervision of\r\nthe book production of the empire. The operations of this commission\r\nwere very largely controlled by the interests, real or imaginary,\r\nof the Catholic Church, and the personal supervision and arbitrary\r\ncensorship of the ecclesiastics, had not a little to do with the\r\ndisintegrating of publishing undertakings in Frankfort and with\r\nthe transfer, some years later, to Leipsic of the leadership in the\r\nbusiness of book production and book distribution.\r\n\r\nHilgers, while admitting the influence of the Jesuits in the direction\r\nof State censorship in South Germany, denies that the results of\r\ntheir work were adverse to the development of literature (“sound\r\nliterature”) or to intellectual activity. Hilgers writes: “It may\r\nat once be admitted that the Jesuit Fathers were, during the 16th\r\ncentury, active in securing in Austria, Bavaria, and other States a\r\ncensorship of literature. The Holy Ignatius, Father of the Order, had\r\nfrom the beginning of his active work insisted upon the responsibility\r\nresting with the Church and with the active workers of the Church for\r\npreserving the faithful from the poison of literature.”[60] In 1550,\r\nand in the years following, Peter Canisius, at that time the head\r\nof the Order in Germany, took active measures for the enforcement\r\nthroughout the empire of the regulations of the Index of Paul IV, and\r\nafter the publication, in 1564, of the Index of Trent, the Jesuit\r\nFathers in Germany had a large part in bringing about the enforcement\r\nof the regulations therein presented. Hilgers points out that, under\r\nJesuit influence, there were issued in Bavaria during the years\r\nsucceeding 1565 not only lists of books condemned and prohibited, but\r\nfurther lists of books commended for the reading of the faithful.\r\nThese catalogues had been prepared by the Jesuit Fathers at the\r\ninstance of Canisius and under the authority of Duke William V. They\r\nwere distributed chiefly through the parish priests. Against the\r\ncontention made by German historians that the influence of the Jesuits,\r\nparticularly in South Germany, had served to restrict, and in certain\r\ninstances practically to repress, literary production and publishing\r\nactivity, Hilgers insists that in Germany, as throughout Europe, the\r\ninfluence of the Order had always been an intellectual influence; and\r\nthat its efforts had furthered education and had advanced the interests\r\nof scholarly literature, of printing, and of publishing. He contends\r\nwith some ingenuity that the elimination from literary production of\r\nactivity in undesirable productions and the concentration of literary\r\nforce in the channels in which such force could be directed to the best\r\nservice of humanity, far from lessening intellectual or literary force,\r\ncould but serve to strengthen this and to render it more effective.[61]\r\n\r\nDuring the first half of the 16th century, there may well have been\r\nground for a censorship of literature in Germany in connection with\r\nthe long series of lampoons and libellous tractates and volumes that\r\ncame into print. Even leaders of thought such as Luther and Reuchlin,\r\nwere tempted into language that became not only unscholarly, but\r\ncoarsely abusive. The more earnestly the community interested itself in\r\nreligious convictions, the more bitter became the expression of hate\r\nand scorn for other earnest believers who had arrived at different\r\nconvictions.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly not in order to hold the Jesuits responsible for\r\nthe general censorship policy of Rome. The direction of the Roman\r\ncensorship has never been in Jesuit hands. The first secretary of the\r\nCongregation of the Index was a Franciscan, while all the succeeding\r\nsecretaries have been Dominicans. Hilgers does not mention one detail\r\nin regard to which this Dominican control of the Congregation has\r\ndoubtless been important: of the books on the Index which were the\r\nwork of members of the great Catholic Orders, those of the Jesuits\r\nequal in number all of the others together. One cause for this was\r\nprobably the fact that this Order included a larger proportion of\r\neducated workers. The literary interests of the Jesuits were greater\r\nand so also was the number of books produced by them.\r\n\r\nDuring the second half of the 18th century, the censorship commissions\r\ninstituted by the State were given powers under which the authority\r\nof the censorship bodies of the Church was materially modified and\r\nrestricted. In Austria, a number of Indexes were compiled by these\r\ncivil commissions, and in Bavaria one such Index was published. These\r\nIndexes have importance chiefly because they represent a claim made on\r\nthe part of the State to control certain matters which, according to\r\nthe ecclesiastics, properly belonged within the exclusive domain of the\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nIn 1752, Maria Theresa, for the purpose of checking the distribution\r\nthroughout the Austrian dominions of Protestant writings, issued an\r\nedict ordering all Catholics to submit to their confessors the copies\r\nof religious books in their possession. The confessors were to retain\r\nall doubtful works and to return the others duly certified with their\r\nsignatures and with an ecclesiastical seal. In 1756, the bookbinders\r\nwere instructed to deliver to the parish priests copies of any\r\nProtestant writings placed in their hands for binding.\r\n\r\nIn 1753, the examination of books that were already in print, together\r\nwith the censorship of works submitted for the purpose of securing\r\na printing permit, was transferred from the University of Vienna\r\nto a censorship commission which was charged with the work both of\r\ncensorship and revision. This commission was appointed under the\r\nimperial authority and remained in existence until 1848. It issued\r\nfrom time to time catalogues of prohibited books. Books were in part\r\nprohibited unconditionally, and in part with the restriction that they\r\nshould be placed only in the hands of scholars who had secured from the\r\npolice authorities a special permission for their use.\r\n\r\nIn 1754, was published the first Austrian Index. It bears the title\r\n_Catalogus librorum rejectorum per Concessum censurae_. After 1758,\r\nthe lists bore the title of _Catalogus librorum a Commissione Aulica\r\nprohibitorum_.\r\n\r\nBetween the years 1758 and 1780, were issued continuations of the Aulic\r\ncatalogues. Later, the system obtained of printing fortnightly lists\r\nof books which had failed to secure an _Imprimatur_ or _Admittetur_,\r\nthese lists being distributed to police magistrates, libraries, and\r\nbooksellers. Every two months the same were classified and reprinted.\r\n\r\nIn 1768, was published in one volume the series of catalogues covering\r\nthe prohibitions of the preceding seven years. The title reads:\r\n_Catalogus Librorum a Commissione Caes. Reg. Aulica Prohibitorum.\r\nVienna mdcclxviii. Prostat. in officiana Libraria Kaliwodiana._\r\nWith this volume, are bound in supplements to a preceding Austrian\r\nIndex, numbered from I to VI, comprising annual lists for the six\r\nyears succeeding 1761. The work was reprinted in Vienna in 1774\r\nwith further annual lists. Similar issues were made, with annual\r\nsupplements, in 1776, 1777, and 1778. These volumes contain lists\r\nonly, with no prefatory matter and no reference to the authority\r\nunder which the condemnations are made. The selections presented a\r\nmuch larger proportion of English books (including plays and novels)\r\nthan have received attention in any other Continental Indexes. Of\r\nMelanchthon only two works are condemned. Mendham points out that the\r\nAulic Council, which was undoubtedly the authority for the preparation\r\nof these lists of prohibitions, was at the time composed of an equal\r\nnumber of Romanists and Protestants. The Aulic Indexes are probably the\r\nonly examples of prohibitions arrived at by the judgment of Catholics\r\nand Protestants working together under the authority of the State.\r\n\r\nIn 1788, was published in Brussels an Index for use in the Austrian\r\nNetherlands, under the title _Catalogue des livres défendus par la\r\nCommission Impériale et Royale_.\r\n\r\nThe _Enchiridion Juris Ecclesiastici Austriaci_, edited by Rechberger\r\nand printed in Vienna, in 1808, presents the ecclesiastical law of\r\nAustria at that date in force. Rechberger declares in his preface that\r\nthe “Index of Trent has no force in the Austrian dominions.”[62]\r\n\r\nIn 1816, was published in Vienna a general Index of German books under\r\nthe title _Neues durchgesehenes Verzeichniss der verbotenen deutschen\r\nBücher_.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier Vienna Indexes, are included the titles of certain works\r\nselected from the Roman Index, but it is difficult to arrive at the\r\nprinciple on which the selection has been made.\r\n\r\nIn 1769, under Max Joseph III, was instituted in Bavaria a “College\r\nof Censorship” comprising, in addition to the president, eight\r\ncouncillors. The subjects of theology and of ecclesiastical\r\nprocedure were placed in the hands of three divines selected from\r\nthe theological faculty of the University of Munich and the other\r\ncouncillors included representatives from the philosophical faculty.\r\n\r\n_Municipal Censorship._--An early instance of the exercise of a\r\ncity censorship occurred in Nuremberg, in 1527, in the case of a volume\r\ncontaining woodcuts illustrating the history of the Tower of Babel,\r\nfor which cuts a rhyming text had been supplied by the cobbler-poet,\r\nHans Sachs. The book had been printed without a license or permission\r\nfrom the magistracy. The magistrates decided that the book must be\r\nsuppressed. They further cautioned Sachs that the writing of verses\r\nwas not his proper business, and that he should keep to his own trade\r\nof shoemaking. The edict was simply an emphatic reiteration of the old\r\nproverb, “Shoemaker, stick to your last.” The difficulty in this case\r\nappears to have been due not to the Lutheran tendencies of Sachs’s\r\nrhymes, but to the lack of respect shown to the magistrates in issuing\r\na book without a permit: and to the further breach of authority on the\r\npart of a man licensed only as a shoemaker undertaking also to carry on\r\nthe avocation of a poet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: France]\r\n\r\nIn France, the first State regulations for the control of the press\r\ndate from 1521, and were directed against the works of the writers of\r\nthe Protestant Reformation. While it was the case that the theologians\r\nof the University and the bishops put into action certain measures\r\nagainst works of heresy, the larger proportion of the censorship\r\nregulations came directly from the Crown or from the Parliament. In\r\n1735, Duplessis d’Argentré published, in three volumes, a _collectio\r\njudiciorum_ which contained the most important of the acts and edicts\r\nin regard to censorship from the faculty of the Sorbonne, from the\r\nbishops, from the Parliament, and from the king up to the year 1735.\r\n\r\nIn 1757, the King (Louis XV) issues an edict prohibiting, under\r\npenalty of death, the publication and distribution of writings against\r\nreligion.[63] There appears to be no record of the enforcement of this\r\npenalty. The policy of Malesherbes, who was director of censorship from\r\n1750 to 1768, was lenient. One of the first acts of the revolutionary\r\nGovernment of 1789 was the repeal of the censorship laws of the old\r\nmonarchy, but the new regulations, established by the revolutionists\r\nthemselves for the control of the press, were still more severe and\r\nexacting than those that they replaced. It may be remembered, however,\r\nthat these regulations, while in form universal, were as a matter of\r\nfact in force only in Paris and one or two other of the larger cities.\r\nDupont, in his _History of Printing_, published in Paris in 1854, says\r\nthat the press had been less seriously burdened under the persecutions\r\nof monarchical government than when it came under the control of the\r\nso-called “liberty” accorded to the community by the revolutionists of\r\n1789. In form at least these revolutionists had shown themselves keenly\r\ninterested in freeing the press from all burdens or restrictions. Under\r\nthe Act of August, 1789, it was decreed as follows: “Article Two. Full\r\nexchange of thought and of opinion is one of the rights most precious\r\nto mankind. Every citizen is to be at liberty to speak, write, and\r\nprint as he will, with the sole restriction that if the liberty be\r\nabused, he will be liable for any injury caused through such abuse.” It\r\nappears that certain inconveniences resulted from this cancellation of\r\nall restrictions. In March, 1793, the convention decrees as follows:\r\n“Whoever shall be convicted of having written or brought into print\r\nbooks or writings of any kind that assail the authority of the national\r\nrepresentatives or that shall advocate the reëstablishment of royalty\r\nor that attempt to antagonise in any way the sovereignty of the people,\r\nshall be brought to trial before the special tribunal and shall, if\r\nconvicted, be punished by death.” As a result of this decree, there\r\nwere brought to the scaffold within the next year twenty journalists\r\nand fifty other writers.\r\n\r\nThe “rights of man” continued, however, to be maintained, at least by\r\ndecree, as unassailable. The constitution of the Jacobins, published in\r\nSeptember, 1793, declares that there must be no interference with the\r\nright of expression of thought and of opinion whether by word of mouth\r\nor in printed documents. In the constitution of the year III (1795)\r\nit is ordered that no censorship shall be imposed on writings before\r\npublication and that no author shall be hindered from bringing into\r\nprint what he will. By September, 1797, the pendulum had again swung in\r\nthe other direction. Under a decree issued in the name of the Senate\r\nand of the Five Hundred it was ordered that sixty journalists and other\r\nwriters and printers who had been charged with conspiracy against the\r\nRepublic should be brought to trial. Bailleul, speaking in the name of\r\nthe Council of the Five Hundred, declared that “the mere existence of\r\nwriters of this class is a crime against Nature ... they constitute\r\na disgrace for mankind. The star of freedom must be freed from their\r\npresence. Not only these writers but the printers who have aided them\r\nin bringing their infamies into print must be banished into the penal\r\ncolonies.” Fifty-five writers and printers were so banished.[64] In\r\n1799, a new press law was enacted which brought the printing-press\r\nformally under the control of the police department. This system\r\nremained in force until the régime of the First Consul, when it was\r\nstrengthened and the regulations were carried out more thoroughly. The\r\ncensorship established under the empire is a part of the history of\r\nEurope. Fouché carried out with full measure of thoroughness the policy\r\nof Napoleon in regard to the operations not only of the journalists but\r\nof the printers, the book publishers, and the booksellers. The shops of\r\nthe latter were placed under reiterated examination in order to avoid\r\nthe risk that they might bring into the territory of France pernicious\r\nliterature. The policy of the imperial censors concerned itself almost\r\nexclusively with works of a political character or which might, through\r\ncriticisms of persons, by any possibility exert a political influence.\r\nThe production and distribution of works in theology and religion had\r\nin any case been very much lessened, and during the consulate and the\r\nempire, there was but very little ecclesiastical censorship. But little\r\nattention seems during these years to have been paid to the protection\r\nof the morals of the community. Criticism of a book as _contra bonos\r\nmores_ does not find place in any of the French censorship lists\r\nof the time. In June, 1806, it was ordered by an imperial edict that\r\nthe director-general should instruct all the booksellers and printers\r\nto place with the minister, in advance of any sales, a copy of every\r\nbook whether it was printed in France or was an importation. They were\r\nat liberty to accept books which belonged without question to the\r\ndivisions of science and art. This was the time in which the battle of\r\nJena was being fought and one might perhaps suppose that the attention\r\nof the Emperor would have been sufficiently engaged with affairs in\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nUnder the imperial censorship, occurred instances of expurgations\r\nwhich recall the expurgatory Indexes of the Spanish Inquisition. In\r\nthe _Athalie_ of Racine, before a new edition was permitted to be\r\nprinted, certain passages had to be cancelled because they contained\r\nallusions to “tyranny.” Chénier had permitted himself in his drama\r\n_Cyrus_ to present the following lines:\r\n\r\n    “_Je ne commande point, j’obéis à la loi;\r\n    Et je suis à l’État, l’État n’est point à moi._”\r\n\r\nThese lines had to be cancelled before the performance of the play was\r\npermitted.[65] Kotzebue’s _Souvenir d’un Voyage_ was prohibited because\r\nthe author had permitted himself certain favourable references to the\r\nlate Queen of Naples and to the English Admiral, Sidney Smith (“that\r\npirate,” said Napoleon). Madame de Staël’s _Corinne_ was prohibited in\r\n1807 and a bitter criticism of the work, printed in the _Moniteur_, is\r\nascribed to the pen of Napoleon himself. Chateaubriand’s _Les Martyrs_\r\nwas, before being published, severely handled by the censors. After\r\nsuffering a large amount of elimination, it was brought into print,\r\nbut even then proved unacceptable and was prohibited. A reference to\r\nthe court of Diocletian was held by the police to constitute a _lèse\r\nMajesté_. In November, 1809, Napoleon specified as the responsibilities\r\nof censorship, _Le droit d’empêcher la manifestation d’idées qui\r\ntroublent la paix de l’État, ses intérêts et le bon ordre_. In the\r\nsame year, Napoleon says: _Qu’on laisse donc écrire librement sur la\r\nreligion, pourvu qu’on n’abuse pas de cette liberté pour écrire contre\r\nl’État_.[66] In 1810, the Emperor instituted the post of _directeur\r\ngeneral de l’imprimerie et de la librairie_, with Portalis as the first\r\nincumbent. The system of inspection and repression established under\r\nthis bureau continued until the close of the empire and was, in fact,\r\nrenewed with no great change after the return of the Bourbons.\r\n\r\nPeignot, writing in 1806, during the “strenuous” years of the First\r\nEmpire and at a time when political censorship in France and in\r\nthe great territories outside of France that were under Napoleonic\r\ncontrol was most severe, is prepared to speak with full measure of\r\nrespect of the importance and the necessity of censorship. He finds\r\nground for criticism, however, in the cases in which the Roman Church\r\nhas undertaken to interfere with the control over French literature\r\nwhich properly belonged to the bishops and to the civil government of\r\nFrance, but he is quite prepared to accept the judgments of the Church\r\nin regard to pernicious books provided that these judgments are kept\r\nsubordinated to the authority of the State.\r\n\r\nPeignot speaks of “the happy Europe of his time” (the Europe controlled\r\nby Napoleon),\r\n\r\n   “in which governments now rest on foundations conformed to\r\n   natural law. Individual liberty maintains itself through nearly\r\n   all the civilised world. The princes recognise that they command\r\n   not themselves but men and that their own authority is so much\r\n   more to be respected when they submit themselves to the laws of\r\n   their State. The rapid progress of science and art has developed\r\n   the human spirit and has freed it from the prejudices and from\r\n   the immorality, the tyranny and anarchy which had in the last\r\n   years of the preceding century shaken and confused Europe.”[67]\r\n\r\nPeignot includes in his lists of books condemned to be burnt not only\r\nthe books which he finds recorded as condemned but certain further\r\nworks which in his judgment ought to have been suppressed.\r\n\r\n_The Results of Jansenism in France._--The Jesuit Hilgers places\r\nupon the Jansenists the responsibility for the wave of heresy, of free\r\nthought, and of unrestricted passion which at the close of the 18th\r\ncentury undermined in France, Church, State, and the foundations of\r\nsociety. Hilgers writes (in substance) as follows:\r\n\r\nDuring the 18th century, through the Jansenism which affected a\r\nlarge part of the community in France, place was being made for the\r\nfree thought philosophy which later became responsible for the great\r\nRevolution, and the result was the burst of a storm of public opinion\r\nagainst the Jesuits. In 1761, the Parliament of Paris prohibited\r\ntwenty-four works by Jesuit writers and a year later, in a fresh\r\nprohibition, condemned a hundred and sixty-three Jesuit treatises.\r\nThe contention was made in these edicts that the prohibited works\r\nhad had an exciting and pernicious effect, had served to undermine\r\nChristian morality, and had tended to demoralise the life and to impair\r\nthe safety of the citizens; and it was further contended that the\r\nopinions presented in these writings constituted an assault against\r\nthe persons of the princes. These pernicious and godless heresies of\r\nthe Jansenists continued to gain strength; the Jesuit Order in France\r\nbecame one of the first victims of the heresy; the Revolution gathered\r\nstrength and the Parliament issued a fresh series of orders; the\r\nsacred persons of the king and queen fell victims on the scaffold\r\nand the best of the citizens lost property and in many cases life;\r\nthe moral law of Christianity was replaced by the law of man and the\r\ngoddess of Reason was accepted as the divinity of the community, and\r\nat her feet were burned as sacrifices the books of religion and the\r\npictures of the saints. History has recorded how extreme became the\r\ntyranny of this world of so-called reason under the laws of men. This\r\ntyranny naturally extended itself to the censorship of all literature.\r\nThe Jacobins controlled with an iron hand journals and journalists;\r\nthe censorship instituted by them enforced the strictest supervision\r\nover their printed and spoken words; and when the rule of the mob was\r\nreplaced by that of the despot Napoleon, the regulations controlling\r\nthe press became still more burdensome and the penalties still more\r\nsevere. Under the rule of Napoleon, it was not only the press of France\r\nof which the freedom was crushed, but throughout the broad territories\r\nof Germany and Italy, under the hand of the despot, every utterance of\r\nthe people was checked and repressed. No censorship ever attempted or\r\nestablished by the Church had equalled in severity, in arbitrariness,\r\nin its crushing influence that instituted first by the so-called people\r\nof France (or to speak more accurately, by the mob of Paris) and later\r\nthat continued and developed by the product of the mob revolution,\r\nNapoleon the despot.\r\n\r\nThe above is a summary of the forcibly presented contention of the\r\nJesuit Hilgers. He traces back to the unrestrained utterances of the\r\nJansenists what he terms the free-will riot of opinion that took\r\npossession of France. He makes this the natural causation of the\r\nexcesses of the Revolution and of the oppressions of Napoleon. It is\r\neasy to point out that the causation is not adequate. The fact that\r\nthe teachings of Port Royal preceded the Revolution is not in itself\r\nsufficient to make Port Royal responsible not only for the Revolution\r\nbut for Napoleon. As the response of a disputant to the criticism of\r\nChurch censorship, the parallel presented by Hilgers is, however,\r\ndeserving of consideration if only as indicating the state of mind\r\nunder which a loyal Romanist interprets history.\r\n\r\n“If,” says Hilgers, “there is to be a sound and safe rule for the\r\ncommunity, it is not possible to permit for men, whose understanding\r\nis at best but limited, an unrestricted freedom of investigation or\r\nof expression. To God alone, whose understanding is unrestricted and\r\nunlimited, can there be absolute freedom from limit for thought or for\r\naction. For man the sole safety lies in control.”[68]\r\n\r\nVoltaire was obliged in 1716 to make sojourn for a number of weeks\r\nin the Bastile on the ground of certain of his ribald _pasquilles_.\r\nBefore this experience, he had already endured banishment on the ground\r\nof other rash utterances. Rousseau’s _Émile_, which finds place in\r\nsuccessive Indexes, was prohibited also by the civil authorities in\r\nParis in 1762. The condemnation in Geneva was somewhat more serious;\r\nthe book was burned by the hangman and the author was condemned to\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\nIn 1827, was printed in Paris (under Charles X) a State Index, under\r\nthe title: _Catalogue des Ouvrages condamnés depuis 1814 jusqu’à\r\nSeptembre, 1827, suivi du texte des jugemens et arrêts insérés au\r\nMoniteur_. The censures are specified as _conformément à l’article 26\r\nde la Loi du 26 Mai, 1819_. The books condemned are for the most part\r\nclassed as immoral.\r\n\r\nHilgers refers to the name of Mirabeau which stands on the Roman\r\nIndex connected with the godless and immoral essay on the Bible that\r\nwas printed anonymously, but the authorship of which was identified.\r\nHe points out that this same book, when later reprinted in Paris, was\r\ncondemned in 1829, and again in 1868, and on these two occasions not by\r\nRome, but by the censorship of the State.\r\n\r\nAmong the books which secured the distinction of condemnation by the\r\ncivil authorities, may be cited the following:\r\n\r\nd’Aubigné, Sieur, _Histoire Universelle_. This book was condemned\r\nand burned in 1667 immediately after its publication, under a decree\r\nof the Parliament and a sentence of the Provost of Paris. The ground\r\nfor the condemnation was certain satirical references contained in the\r\nhistory concerning Charles IX, Henry III, and Henry IV.\r\n\r\nBeaumarchais, Pierre Augustin Caron de, _Mémoire_. The book was\r\ncondemned and ordered to be burned by the public hangman under a\r\ndecree of the Parliament of Paris, February, 1774. It was described as\r\ncontaining scandalous charges against the magistracy and the members of\r\nthe Parliament.[69]\r\n\r\nTo France had been accorded, since the time of Pepin, the title of\r\n“eldest son of the Church.” It is France, however (or perhaps one\r\nshould say consequently), that has found occasion to repudiate or to\r\nannul the greatest number of papal Bulls. I cite as follows certain of\r\nthe more noteworthy of these acts of protest or of rebellion against\r\nthe authority of Rome.\r\n\r\n_Papal Bulls Repudiated in France._--1300. Boniface VIII. A Bull\r\nwas issued by the Pope against Philip the Fair in connection with\r\nthe injunction imposed by the Pope upon the King to make a pilgrimage\r\nto the Holy Land, and more immediately as a result of the treatment\r\naccorded by Philip to the papal emissary, who had been imprisoned for\r\nthreatening interdict against the King. The Bull of excommunication\r\nwas replied to with a decree from the King headed: _Philippe, par le\r\ngrâce de Dieu roi des Français, à Boniface prétendu pape, peu ou point\r\nde salut_.\r\n\r\n1407. Benedict XIII (classed as an anti-pope). In this Bull the Pope\r\nexcommunicates all those who undertake to prevent the peaceable\r\nsettlement for which he was working and who opposed themselves to his\r\ndesigns as the University of Paris had already done. The Pope places\r\nunder interdict the kingdom of France and the domains of the empire.\r\n\r\nCharles II, the Parliament, the clergy, and the University of Paris\r\nissued in general council a decree stating that Benedict was not only a\r\nschismatic but a heretic.\r\n\r\n1510. Julius II excommunicates Louis XII because the King had refused\r\nto deliver to the Pope certain cities over which the Curia claimed\r\nto have rights. Louis is reported to have said when learning of his\r\nexcommunication: _Saint Pierre avait bien autres choses à faire que\r\nse mêler des affaires des empereurs sous lesquels il vivait_. The\r\nKing appealed to the General Council of Pisa. The Pope, in confirming\r\nthe interdict on the kingdom, relieved the subjects of Louis from their\r\noath of allegiance. Louis in his turn excommunicated the Pope and\r\ncaused to be struck certain pieces of money which bore on the reverse\r\n_perdam Babylonis nomen_. The Council of Pisa refused to confirm\r\nthe interdict of the Pope, who thereupon called the Council of the\r\nLateran, but he died before this council had given a decision.\r\n\r\n1580. The Bull _In Coena Domini_, issued by Gregory XIII, was\r\npublicly burned in Paris under decree of Parliament. This burning was\r\nthe result of an attempt of the Pope to have the Bull published in\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n1585. Sixtus V issues a Bull against the King of Navarre, later Henry\r\nIV. The Pope declares the King, together with the Prince of Condé,\r\nto have been convicted of heresy and to be enemies of God and of\r\nreligion. He decrees that the King shall be deposed from all rights\r\nin the kingdom of Navarre and in the principality of Berne, and shall\r\nforfeit his claim to the throne of France. This Bull gave satisfaction\r\nto the League in France, but had no political effect. The reply of\r\nHenry, copies of which were placed on the doors of the palace of the\r\ncardinals in Rome and even on the door of the Vatican, takes the ground\r\nthat the declaration and excommunication on the part of Sixtus V,\r\n_soi-disant_ Pope of Rome, are false and are based on falsehood.\r\nThe Pope is declared to be anti-Christ.\r\n\r\n1591. Gregory XIV publishes in Rome two Bulls by the first of which\r\nhe declares Henry IV to be a heretic and to be excommunicated and\r\ndeposed from his kingdom; by the second, he places under interdict\r\nall ecclesiastics who may render homage to the King. Henry replies by\r\nordering the Bull of Gregory to be burned before the gate of his palace\r\nand declares this _soi-disant_ Pope to be an enemy of the King,\r\nan enemy of France, and an enemy of peace and Christianity.\r\n\r\nMarch, 1809. Pius VII issued a Bull of excommunication against his\r\nadversaries, this Bull being directed more particularly at Napoleon.\r\nNapoleon forbids the publication of the Bull in France and in the\r\nterritories controlled by the French Empire and causes the Pope to be\r\nseized and taken from Rome to Savona and later to Fontainebleau. For\r\na term of four years, during which he was practically a prisoner, the\r\nPope refused to accept the instruction of the Emperor to cancel the\r\nBull, but in January, 1813, he yielded, the Bull was recalled, and the\r\n_Concordat_ was signed. This _Concordat_ remained in force,\r\nat least in substance, up to 1906, in which year it was cancelled by\r\nthe French Republic.\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1860. Pius IX issued a Bull (also described as an anathema)\r\nagainst those who had abetted the invasion of his dominions. This\r\nBull was directed at Victor Emmanuel, who had, after the successful\r\nconclusion of the war with Austria, annexed the papal States, and at\r\nNapoleon III, through whose co-operation this annexation had proved\r\npossible. The Bull was, as far as France was concerned, suppressed by\r\nNapoleon III, who also suppressed the Paris journal (_Le Monde_)\r\nin which the Bull had been published.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spain and Portugal]\r\n\r\nThe law of 1558, which continued in force until the publication, in\r\n1812, of the Constitution of Cadiz, rendered the supervision of the\r\npress a process as cumbrous as it was thorough. Every manuscript for\r\nwhich a license was desired had to be passed upon by an examiner\r\nappointed by the Royal Council. After such examination, it was\r\ndelivered to the corrector general, and when it had passed through\r\nthe press, the manuscript as annotated by this official was returned\r\nto him with the printed copy for comparison. If the author was an\r\necclesiastic, a preliminary examination and approbation by his superior\r\nwere also required. The book as printed carried on its front page a\r\nlong series of official certificates, and the same process had to be\r\nrepeated for each succeeding edition. The fees were provided by the\r\nauthor or printer and constituted, of necessity, an additional charge\r\non the actual cost of production. As the system grew more complex, the\r\nfees and the fines were multiplied so that the total charge became for\r\neach publication a very serious matter indeed. The interests of the\r\nreaders were guarded by accompanying the license with a _tassa_\r\nor specification of the price at which the book was to be sold, which\r\nprice was determined by the Royal Council. This _tassa_ was not\r\nabandoned until 1762, when it was taken off all books excepting what\r\nare called books of necessity, that is to say books of instruction,\r\neither secular or religious.[70] The charge assumed by the Spanish\r\ncensors brought upon them, as was the case with the censors of other\r\ncountries, an unavoidable responsibility for the soundness, orthodoxy,\r\nand morality of everything that, having succeeded in passing the\r\nofficial examination, was permitted to come into print.\r\n\r\nIn 1682, it was ordered that books on the several subjects “affecting\r\nthe interests of the State” (a definition which was of course\r\ncapable of a very wide range of application) should be submitted to\r\na special council or the department to whose affairs they related.\r\nThe approbation of such department must be secured before the license\r\ncould be issued. For instance, a book in regard to the colonies called\r\nfor the approval of the Colonial Department, and one in regard to\r\ncommerce or metals had to be submitted to the Department of Commerce.\r\nAs late as 1757, a law issued by Ferdinand VI, and repeated in 1778\r\nby Carlos III, ordered that all books on medical science must, before\r\nbeing published, secure the approval of a physician selected by the\r\npresident of the _Protomedicato_. Printers and publishers, under the\r\nclose supervision of the host of officials who had charge of the\r\nprinting-offices and bookshops, were practically outlawed. The only\r\nprinters who had any measure of freedom of action were those who\r\ncarried on the printing-offices in the religious houses. The Crown\r\ncould deprive its subjects of their civil rights, but it dared not\r\nmeddle with ecclesiastical privileges. In 1752, under a royal decree,\r\nit is prohibited to import or to sell any books in Spanish written\r\nby Spaniards and printed abroad without special royal license; the\r\npenalty is death and confiscation. The death penalty could, however,\r\nbe commuted to four years of _presidio_. With this varied series of\r\nobstacles in the way of printing and burdensome charges increasing\r\nthe cost of publication, it is by no means surprising that the\r\nproduction of books in Spain was, for the three centuries after\r\n1560, inconsiderable as compared with that of the other States of\r\nEurope. As Lea says, Spain fell absolutely behind in the development\r\nof literature, science, arts, and industry, when human thought\r\nseeking expression was surrounded and rendered ineffectual by so many\r\nimpediments. Carlos III, realising the disadvantage to the community\r\nof the hampering of the work of the printing-press, undertook, in\r\n1769, to remove certain of the restrictions. In 1778, he was able\r\nto congratulate himself on the increased prosperity of the printing\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nIn 1782, the Inquisitor-General Bertram, following the instructions\r\ngiven in the Index of Benedict in 1756, recalled the prohibition of the\r\nprinting and reading of Spanish versions of the Bible, a prohibition\r\nwhich had endured for two hundred and fifty years. This action brought\r\nout sharp antagonism on the part of many of the ecclesiastics and after\r\nthe revolutionary events of 1789, the Inquisition re-established the\r\nlarger number of the old-time prohibitions and included in these a\r\nfresh prohibition for the reading of the Scriptures. The censorship\r\nactivity of the five years succeeding 1789 was, however, particularly\r\ndirected against the importation of political and so-called\r\nphilosophical publications from France. After the restoration of the\r\nSpanish monarchy under Ferdinand VII, the old regulations of the Index\r\nwere again confirmed under an edict of July 22, 1815. There were,\r\nlater, certain modifications in these regulations, but in June, 1830,\r\nan elaborate law re-established the entire censorship system with its\r\ncumbrous machinery; every work contrary to the Catholic Faith or to the\r\nroyal prerogative was forbidden under pain of death, and provision was\r\nmade for the most elaborate supervision of books imported from abroad.\r\n\r\nIn 1768, Joseph I of Portugal declared that the _Bulla Coena_ and the\r\nother Bulls of the Church having to do with censorship, and the series\r\nof Roman Indexes were not to be held as binding upon his subjects\r\nexcepting in so far as they had been specifically confirmed by the\r\nState Government. Joseph instituted a commission to take charge of\r\nthe matter of censorship; but this body did not produce any Index. In\r\n1771, however, it issued a list of sixty books prohibited under the\r\nauthority of the Church, this list being made up chiefly of treatises\r\nby Jesuits, Escobar, Mariana, Saintarella, etc. Fourteen further works\r\nwere to be sold only when containing a printed notice in which were to\r\nbe specified the condemned passages.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Switzerland]\r\n\r\n=3. Protestant States.=--The Roman procedure in censorship in\r\nSwitzerland, and particularly in Geneva, presents close analogies to\r\nthe methods in force in Rome.\r\n\r\nIn 1525, the magistracy of Zurich established a so-called State Church.\r\nUnder the regulations of this Church, no preaching could be permitted\r\nwithin the territory of the city other than the pure Gospel of Zwingli\r\nand his associates. The books of worship of the Catholics were ordered\r\nto be delivered and burned and a similar course was taken with the\r\nLutheran Bibles and the Lutheran works of instruction of Melanchthon. A\r\nsimilar action was taken in Geneva under the direction of Calvin. The\r\naltars and altar pictures were destroyed and the Catholics were ordered\r\nto deliver for like destruction their books of worship, of song, and\r\ntheir catechism. The Inquisition established in Geneva assumed the\r\nauthority to visit houses and shops and to confiscate for destruction\r\nall heretical books. In 1539, the magistrates ordered that no book\r\nshould be printed until it had received a license from the authorities.\r\nThis decree was renewed in 1556 and in 1560. The burning of Servetus,\r\nunder the authority of the court instituted by Calvin, occurred in\r\n1553.\r\n\r\nIn 1554, Calvin published his _Defensio Orthodoxi et Fidei de S.\r\nTrinitate contra Prodigiosos Errores Mich. Serveti Hispanii_, etc.\r\nThis “Defence” bears, in addition to the name of the author, the\r\nsubscriptions of fifteen of the divines of the Geneva Church. Later,\r\nCalvin called the theologians of Basel to account for permitting the\r\npublication of an anonymous monograph written as an answer to his\r\n“Defence,” and demanded that the publishers of the same should be duly\r\npunished. Even after the death of Calvin (1564), the censorship system\r\nwas renewed and continued.[71]\r\n\r\nIn 1580, Henricus Stephanus (whose father Robert had migrated to\r\nGeneva in order to free his printing-press from the censorship of the\r\nCatholic divines) was brought before the city council and formally\r\nreprimanded because, in a certain volume of _Dialogues du Nouveau\r\nLangage Français_, he had made additions to the text after this had\r\nbeen passed upon by the censors. He was reminded that he was already\r\nunder reprimand in connection with his _Apologia Herodoti_, and\r\nwas cautioned that, if he did further printing without securing a\r\npermit for the text as finally worded, he would lose his license.\r\nIt was decided finally by the Consistorium that Stephanus was not\r\nobeying the regulations, and he was declared to be excommunicated,\r\nwhile the magistrates condemned him to a week’s imprisonment. In 1559,\r\nknowledge came to the Church authorities in Basel that a certain\r\nheretical writer named David Joris had for some little time lived in\r\nthe city unrecognised, and had died there in 1556. A formal process was\r\nentered into against the disinterred remains of Joris, and he was duly\r\ncondemned (we may say _in absentia_) for heresy. His portrait and\r\nhis books were burned by the public hangman. In 1563, in the process\r\nheld in Zürich against Ochinus, it was made a charge that, without\r\nfirst securing permission from the city censors, he had brought into\r\nprint, in Basel, a monograph on the Lord’s Supper.[72] In 1562, Beza\r\nbrought before the Synod of Geneva a book of Morelli de Villiers which\r\nhe described as heretical. The synod, accepting Beza’s view, orders the\r\nbook to be prohibited and existing copies to be burned. One copy was\r\nburned in public by the hangman.\r\n\r\nIn 1566, Jo. Val. Gentilis was, in consideration of his repentance,\r\nspared from death but sentenced to walk through the street of Geneva\r\nin his shirt, barefooted, and with a burning candle in his hand, and,\r\nafter doing penance in the church, he was, with his own hands, to burn\r\nhis books. His march was to be preceded by trumpeters who were to\r\nspecify his crime. Afterwards he was to be confined in Geneva for an\r\napparently indefinite period. He escaped but was recaptured and was\r\ndecapitated and burned.\r\n\r\nIn Basel, the first decree having to do with censorship emanated from\r\nno less an authority than Erasmus. In 1542, the magistrates issued an\r\norder prohibiting, under a penalty of a hundred dollars, the printing\r\nof any book until it had been examined and approved by the municipal\r\ncensors.\r\n\r\nAn example is presented in Geneva, in 1645, of a prohibition\r\nor suppression of a book with a payment made to the author as\r\nconsideration for his loss. The name of the author was Brios; the book\r\nwas entitled _L’homme hardi à la France_. The amount paid was ten\r\ncrowns. I do not find record of another instance of compensation in\r\nconnection with the cancelling of a book.[73]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Protestant Germany]\r\n\r\nIn certain of the States which had accepted Protestantism, attempts\r\nwere made at an early date to institute a censorship over the\r\nproductions of the printing-press. There was, however, no central\r\nauthority through which a permanent censorship organisation could\r\nbe maintained and it was not practicable to enforce any penalties\r\nfor the possession or the reading of condemned books that could be\r\nconsidered the equivalent of excommunication. No Protestant rulers\r\ntook the ground that the reading of false or of erroneous doctrine\r\nconstituted a mortal sin. The responsible authority for such censorship\r\nas came into existence rested with the State. Action was taken by the\r\nState most frequently at the instance of the theological faculties\r\nof the universities, and it was to these bodies that was as a rule\r\ncommitted the task of supervising and examining the books that came\r\ninto question. In the case, however, of works that were charged with\r\nassailing the rulers of the State or with any utterances _contra\r\nbonos mores_, the civil officials were accustomed to take the\r\ndirection of the matter into their own hands. The German princes\r\nsometimes also assumed the authority to supervise matters of theology,\r\na weakness that has been paralleled as late as the 20th century by\r\na German Emperor. Duke Ludwig of Würtemberg, in 1585, announced for\r\ninstance that in his duchy no work of theology should come into print\r\nthat had not been passed upon and approved by himself. He made no\r\nexception even for the writings of the divines of his own principality,\r\nthe soundness of whose orthodoxy might, one should suppose, have been\r\nalready tested.\r\n\r\nIn 1561, the Duke of Weimar appointed a consistorium, comprising four\r\ndivines and four laymen, which was charged with the duty of examining\r\nall books offered for sale in the duchy, whether these were printed\r\nwithin the confines of Weimar or were importations. A book offered\r\nfor sale without the approval of the consistorium (whose meetings\r\ntook place only four times a year) was ordered to be confiscated. For\r\na serious offence, such as a repeated disregard of the regulation,\r\nthe printer or dealer was subject to a fine. The theologians of Jena\r\npromptly made protest against such a censorship, particularly in the\r\ncase of imported books. They took the broad ground that the writing of\r\nbooks was a necessary responsibility of learning or of knowledge, and\r\nthat any attempt to restrict the use of men’s thinking power or the\r\nexpression of their opinions was an attempt to place restrictions upon\r\nthe Holy Ghost himself.[74]\r\n\r\nThe chief difficulty in the application of any censorship regulation\r\nwithin the Lutheran States was the existence of different schools of\r\nbelief, the controversies between which soon became active. The control\r\nof the censorship machinery for any one State fell into the hands\r\nfirst of one set of controversialists and then of another, according\r\nto the activity of the respective leaders and to the influence brought\r\nto bear upon the local ruler. In the Lutheran States, such as Saxony,\r\nthe prohibition against papistical writings was accompanied by an\r\nequally sweeping condemnation of the writings of the Calvinists;\r\nwhile the Calvinistic authorities of States like Brandenburg were\r\nprompt on their side to take similar measures for the protection\r\nof their own special tenets. This continued conflict between the\r\nseveral groups of reformers had the necessary effect of bringing into\r\ndisrepute and ineffectiveness the larger portion of the attempts at\r\ncensorship control. Some attempts were made towards a more tolerant\r\nand a more practicable policy. Zwingli, for instance, insisted that\r\nhis fellow-believers in Essling should follow the Christian example of\r\nthe church in Zürich, which refused to interfere with the sale even of\r\nAnabaptist writings; but in Zürich itself this tolerant spirit was not\r\nlong permitted to control.\r\n\r\nThe Elector of Saxony[75] prohibited, under a penalty of three thousand\r\ngulden, the printing of the _Corpus Doctrinae_ of Melanchthon,\r\nand Frederick II of Denmark prohibited preachers and instructors,\r\nunder penalty of the loss of their positions and (for persistency\r\nin misdoing) of further punishments, the use of the formula of the\r\n_Concordia_. Again, in 1574, the Elector of Saxony compelled the\r\nmembers of the University of Wittenberg to subscribe to an oath that\r\nthey would neither purchase nor read the writings of the Sacramentists\r\nor of the Vermigli.\r\n\r\nIn 1439, Nicholas Wohlrab, who had, under the instructions of Duke\r\nGeorge of Saxony and the Magistracy of Leipsic, brought into print the\r\n_Postille_ of Wicels, was put into prison by Duke Henry, acting\r\nat the instance of the Elector John Frederick. Before he could secure\r\nhis release, Wohlrab was obliged to take oath to bring no further\r\nworks into print or into sale until these had received the censorship\r\nand the approval of the magistrates. The three other book-dealers of\r\nLeipsic were forbidden to print or to sell any books that had not\r\nsecured approval of the censor appointed by the magistrates, and two\r\ndeputy magistrates were detached to make a weekly inspection of\r\nthe printing-offices and assure themselves that nothing was printed\r\nantagonistic to the teachings of the Gospel.[76]\r\n\r\nThere were from time to time schemes for a Protestant Index. In 1579,\r\nDuke Julius of Brunswick brought out a scheme for charging a general\r\nsynod with the duty of compiling an Index of heretical books and of\r\ninstituting measures for the censorship of the press; but the plan was\r\nnot put into execution.\r\n\r\nIn 1593, Duke Louis of Würtemberg issued an instruction to the\r\nUniversity of Tübingen which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n   “Book-dealers must be cautioned under sufficient penalties,\r\n   neither to print, to possess, nor to sell, heretical or\r\n   pernicious books, such as the abominable writings of the\r\n   Jesuits. The preachers are directed to warn their hearers\r\n   against the unclean literature. In order, however, that the\r\n   instructors and preachers should be able to secure knowledge of\r\n   the arguments of their adversaries and of the nature of their\r\n   calumnies, printer George Gruppenbach is ordered to secure two\r\n   copies of each of such books as are available and to deliver\r\n   the same to the university. The preachers whose erudition and\r\n   good judgment can be trusted to keep them from being led astray\r\n   by pernicious doctrines, are to be permitted to read these\r\n   heretical and sectarian writings, in order that they may be in a\r\n   position to defend the true Faith. The superintendent appointed\r\n   for the purpose is to keep a record of the pernicious books so\r\n   distributed and is to secure reports as to the use made of them.\r\n   The copies themselves are in any case to be returned to the\r\n   university authorities, so that they may not be used to pervert\r\n   the people. All this is done ‘In order that the assaults of the\r\n   hateful Satan (who in these last days has been permitted to work\r\n   much evil upon the Church of God) shall be withstood, and that\r\n   for the people in this principality the true Faith shall be\r\n   preserved and their souls shall be kept clean.’”[77]\r\n\r\nLuther was, it should be remembered, thoroughly in accord with pope\r\nand with emperor in the belief that it was the duty of the faithful to\r\ndestroy heresy. He only differed from the pope as to what constituted\r\nheresy. In 1525, we find him invoking the aid of the censorship\r\nregulations of Saxony and of Brandenburg for the purpose of stamping\r\nout the “pernicious doctrines” of the Anabaptists and of the followers\r\nof Zwingli. The Protestant princes were for the most part more than\r\nwilling to establish and to maintain a censorship for the presses of\r\ntheir several localities, as such a system served in more ways than one\r\nto strengthen their authority, while it could be utilised also to head\r\noff undesirable criticism.\r\n\r\nIn 1525, Luther decides that a censorship ought to be established in\r\nthe Protestant States. He asks the Protestant princes to co-operate in\r\ninstituting the machinery for the purpose. The regulations established\r\nby the princes interfered seriously with the operations of the\r\nprinters in the larger places, but proved ineffectual for securing\r\nany uniformity of religious publishing throughout the States of North\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nIn 1532, Luther calls upon Duke Heinrich of Mecklenburg, for the\r\nsake of the Gospel of Christ and for the saving of souls, to prevent\r\nfrom coming into print a translation of the Gospels that had been\r\nprepared by the Catholic priest Emser. Melanchthon was fully in accord\r\nwith Luther as to the necessity of repressing with sharpest and most\r\neffective censorship all books that were not in accord with the\r\nProtestant faith.\r\n\r\nZwingli and Calvin, acting each from his own point of view, established\r\nin their respective cities a censorship that was much more bitter\r\nand strenuous than anything as yet attempted under the authority of\r\nRome. Hilgers points out that the Lutherans with their schools and\r\ntheir cliques, the Zwinglians, the Calvinists, the Anabaptists, the\r\nMennonites, the Schwenckfeldians, the Weigelians, and the Socinians,\r\ncontended with each other with full use of the weapon of censorship,\r\nand in censorship as in religion it was always the brutal power of\r\nthe strongest that came into control. The princes, establishing with\r\nreadiness a censorship machinery, changed the application of their\r\npenalties as they changed their faith, but the penalties themselves\r\nbecame, with each change, more severe.[78]\r\n\r\nAccording to Gretser, the first article of the Calvinistic theologian\r\nstated that “the writings of Luther must be stamped out from the Church\r\nof God.”[79] In Saxony, in the Palatinate, in Baden, in Würtemberg,\r\nin Brandenburg, and in Prussia after 1550, we find in full force a\r\nseries of Protestant censorships directed sometimes spasmodically, but\r\nusually with no little bitterness, under the authority of the political\r\npower.[80]\r\n\r\nThe Jesuit Hilgers, who naturally makes use of Luther as a\r\ncharacteristic example of Protestant intolerance in censorship, writes:\r\n\r\n   “Luther, who characteristically enough began his notorious\r\n   career with the burning of books, was by no means prepared to\r\n   accept with patience any Catholic literature that stood in his\r\n   way. What, nevertheless, made the Lutheran movement a radical\r\n   revolution was the acceptance of the right of individual freedom\r\n   of inquiry, a right that was to make each man the authority for\r\n   his individual views of faith and doctrine against the accepted\r\n   Catholic principle that the authority for the interpretation\r\n   of doctrine and for the guidance of faith must rest with the\r\n   Church.... Luther accepted as authoritative the teaching of the\r\n   Scriptures, but it was his contention that this teaching could\r\n   be ascertained by the individual understanding and without the\r\n   guidance of the Holy Church. This very principle, however, of\r\n   individual interpretation was almost immediately set to one\r\n   side by Luther himself. He found that what he propounded as\r\n   the true Faith could be maintained only through the protection\r\n   of his faithful from the influence of pernicious literature;\r\n   and he instituted promptly, to the extent of his own power,\r\n   a censorship against not only the writings of the Catholics\r\n   from whom he had broken away, but still more sharply against\r\n   those of fellow-Protestants whose views of interpretation\r\n   differed in any manner from his own. Luther became himself the\r\n   first censor of the Word of God, and set up his individual\r\n   understanding as a guide not merely for himself but for the\r\n   misguided who were ready to accept the word of a single man\r\n   rather than the authority of the Church universal.... Under\r\n   the divine government, men have been placed in dependence\r\n   upon each other. It is only through full recognition of this\r\n   interdependent relation that State and Church can come into\r\n   existence and can be maintained. No reasonable man will deny for\r\n   a father the right and the duty to preserve son and daughter\r\n   from the influence of pernicious companionship. One could more\r\n   reasonably contend against the authority of the Lord in Heaven\r\n   to impose upon Adam and Eve in Paradise certain prohibitions.\r\n   That a still more seriously pernicious influence can be\r\n   brought about by bad books than even by evil companionship can\r\n   be denied by no thoughtful man. The evil is none the less\r\n   because it may be brought about under the name of freedom and\r\n   enlightenment. No father, with a proper consciousness of his\r\n   own responsibilities, will permit a son who is still a youth\r\n   to receive without restriction teachings, whether religious,\r\n   philosophical, medical, or scientific, which have been shaped\r\n   for the understanding only of older men.... The father must on\r\n   his own authority restrict, direct, and select the literature\r\n   upon which is based the instruction of his children. The\r\n   authority of the State makes necessary a supervision of the\r\n   action and influence of the printing-press. The Church includes\r\n   in its responsibilities the relation of the father to the child\r\n   and of the Government to the citizen. Its rulers must watch\r\n   not only the matter of morality but that of sound doctrine and\r\n   wholesome influence. If the ruler of a modern State finds it\r\n   impossible to permit the circulation of writings which assail\r\n   the character or the person of king or emperor, how much less is\r\n   it possible for those who direct the government of the Church\r\n   to permit the circulation of writings which assail the wisdom\r\n   and the authority of the Lord of Hosts or of his Son. The realm\r\n   of the Church is that of faith and of conduct, a realm which is\r\n   of necessity directly influenced by the spoken word and still\r\n   more by the word circulated in print. It is this realm that must\r\n   be defended and protected against the invasion of the poison\r\n   of pernicious and unsound writings. As in the modern State, a\r\n   special system is required for the organisation of the defensive\r\n   power represented by such bodies as the army and the police, so\r\n   is it necessary for the Church, with the organisation of its own\r\n   ecclesiastical army of bishops, priests, deacons, and soldiers\r\n   of the Faith, to establish regulations for discipline, for\r\n   defence, and, when the time comes, for assault upon the powers\r\n   of evil. This system of the Church is expressed most logically\r\n   through its control of thought and of literature, for the Church\r\n   works through the mind with spiritual forces. The authorities of\r\n   a city are prepared to prohibit, under the severest penalties,\r\n   miscellaneous disturbances or a careless handling of dynamite;\r\n   such precautions in regard to personal harm as the mayor finds\r\n   necessary for the safety of his community, the bishop is under\r\n   similar necessity of adopting for the preserving of his flock\r\n   against spiritual assaults.”[81]\r\n\r\nIn 1595, the astronomer, Johann Kepler, completed his first\r\nastronomical treatise, the _Mysterium Cosmographicum_, which was\r\nto be printed in Tübingen. Before the book could come into print, it\r\nwas necessary to secure the approval of the senate of the university.\r\nThe theological faculty gave permission for the printing only after\r\ncancelling the chapter in which the author undertook to bring the\r\nCopernican system into accord with the Scriptures. In Leipsic, the\r\nprinting of the book was prohibited.\r\n\r\nThe great Elector of Brandenburg, in 1670, ordered that, for the\r\npurpose of avoiding religious strife and controversy, there should be a\r\nthorough censorship of all books, whether printed within his territory\r\nor imported from without, which were concerned with matters of theology\r\nor religion.\r\n\r\nAn order issued in Cologne in 1662 prescribes that the preachers shall\r\nengage in no disputations or conferences and shall bring into print no\r\ncontroversial writings, without the specific permission of the Elector\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nIn 1772, a Cabinet order prescribes that theological books for\r\nwhich privileges are demanded must be examined and, if necessary,\r\nrevised by a consistorial commission comprised of certain Protestant\r\necclesiastics. The penalties imposed upon an ecclesiastic for printing\r\nany volume for which special permission had not been secured were\r\nparticularly severe.\r\n\r\nThe persecution of Christian Wolff, who held for a series of years\r\na professorship in Halle, is cited as a characteristic example of\r\nProtestant censorship and intolerance. The philosophic doctrines\r\ntaught by the professor excited the indignation of Frederick II and in\r\n1773, under a Cabinet order, Wolff was deprived of his post and was\r\nordered to leave Prussian territory within forty-eight hours. Other\r\ninstructors who had accepted the so-called Wolffian philosophy, such as\r\nGabriel Fischer of Königsberg, were in like manner deprived of their\r\noffices and banished from the country. The various operations of royal\r\ncensorship under the great Elector and his several successors, up to\r\nand including Frederick the Great, present examples of tyrannical\r\ninconsistency, inconsequence, unreasonableness, ignorance, and\r\nnarrowness which have not been surpassed, and have possibly hardly been\r\nequalled, under any of the regulations of the Roman Index.\r\n\r\nFrederick the Great developed the political censorship of Prussia\r\ninto a system the influence of which persists under the German Empire\r\nof to-day. His censorship was directed more particularly against\r\nliterature affecting the interests of the State, but it included the\r\nfull control of theological utterances.\r\n\r\nAfter the occupation of Silesia, an order was issued directing the\r\nBishop of Breslau to submit for the approval of the royal censors,\r\nbefore publication, all edicts or utterances on the part of the\r\nCatholic Church.\r\n\r\nIn 1775, the King prohibited the publication in his dominions of the\r\nBull of Clement XIV.\r\n\r\nIn 1784, Frederick the Great issued an edict prohibiting under serious\r\npenalties the acceptance by any of his subjects of Catholic doctrines.\r\nThis edict being contrary to the conventions in force, he was obliged,\r\nhowever, to withdraw it.\r\n\r\nIn 1792, Frederick William issues an order for the systematising of the\r\ncensorship of the kingdom. It is directed that all printing-offices,\r\npublishing concerns, and bookshops be placed under the strictest\r\nsupervision, that no work shall come into print until it has secured\r\nthe approval of the royal censors. The penalties included, in addition\r\nto fines, the cancellation of the editions, and in case of a persistent\r\ndisobedience, the banishment of the delinquent. The university\r\nprofessors are also brought under close supervision for their\r\nutterances in lectures.\r\n\r\nIn 1794, in which year censorship in England was practically abandoned,\r\nthe censorship system in Prussia under Frederick William II. became\r\nmore severe and exacting than ever before.\r\n\r\nIn 1794, the _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_ is prohibited in\r\nPrussian dominions as constituting an influence against the Christian\r\nreligion. This is an example of a long series of similar prohibitions.\r\nIn 1816, the _Rheinische Merkür_ of the poet Görres, who had done\r\nso much to arouse public opinion against Napoleon, was suppressed under\r\na Cabinet order. The royal censorship was ameliorated under Frederick\r\nWilliam but was again strengthened in 1848 and during the years\r\nimmediately succeeding.\r\n\r\nIn 1844–5 was published at Jena a catalogue entitled _Index Librorum\r\nProhibitorum_, giving the titles only of books prohibited in Germany.\r\n\r\nIn 1882, was published in Berlin what is probably the latest of the\r\nState Indexes. It is devoted to a list of works maintaining the\r\nprinciples of the Social Democrats, which works had been condemned and\r\nprohibited under the authority of an act of the Reichsrath of 1878. The\r\nlist includes several hundred publications, chiefly pamphlets.\r\n\r\nThe political censorship existing to-day throughout Prussia and the\r\nGerman Empire under the imperial control is of course familiar to all\r\nreaders of the 20th century. Between 1878 and the close of the century,\r\na very long list of Social Democratic writings, pamphlets, books, and\r\njournals came under condemnation and suppression. This policy was\r\ncontinued into the 20th century, although under present conditions its\r\nthorough enforcement is a matter of increasing difficulty.\r\n\r\nHilgers points out that the instances of Protestant political\r\ncensorship against works which are purely literary or intellectual\r\nin their character, that is to say, which had no direct concern with\r\neither religion or politics, are far more numerous than under the\r\naction of the censorship authorities of Rome. Among other examples, he\r\npoints out the action of Luther against the works of Erasmus and the\r\nwritings of a number of the Humanists; the decree of the Duke of Weimar\r\n(acting at the initiative of Goethe) against _Isis_, and for the\r\nsuppression of the epoch-making writings of the philosopher Fichte; the\r\nacts of Frederick the Great against Voltaire, and the measures taken by\r\nBismarck against a long series of writings that came into print during\r\nthe _Kulturkampf_.\r\n\r\nAn order issued in January, 1903, by the rector of the University of\r\nBerlin, prohibits the delivery of a lecture on Proudhon and Lasalle\r\non the ground that it was necessary to take “all possible precautions\r\nfor the protection of young souls from the pernicious and poisonous\r\ninfluence of sociological errors.”[82]\r\n\r\nIn November, 1902, in a convention held at Hamburg of the teachers\r\nof Germany, it was proposed to prohibit the use in schools of the\r\ncatechism of Luther and of the Protestant Scriptures.[83]\r\n\r\nThe German _Goethe-bund_ finds occasion to make protest, in 1903,\r\nagainst the _lex Heinze_: “In Berlin, we are not only under the\r\nburden of dramatic censorship which never sleeps and which causes\r\nperpetual irritation, but we have to endure the exacting regulations of\r\nthe general press law under which are controlled not merely journals\r\nbut publications of all kinds. For instance, in the three months from\r\nOctober to December, 1902, no less than seventy-seven works were\r\ncondemned and their further publication prohibited; that is to say,\r\nin these three months the civil authority condemned more books than\r\nhad been placed in the prohibitory Index of Rome during the ten years\r\npreceding.” With such experience under the State control of the press,\r\nit is, claims Hilgers, absurd to make reference to “the pernicious\r\ninterference with literature on the part of the Church censors.”\r\n\r\nKant’s _Critique of Pure Reason_, prohibited, in its Italian\r\ntranslation, in the Roman Index since 1827, had, years before that\r\ndate, come under the condemnation of the royal authority of Prussia. In\r\nOctober, 1792, a Cabinet order contains a bitter characterisation of\r\nthe work: “Our sacred person you have with your so-called philosophy\r\nattempted to bring into contempt ... and you have at the same time\r\nassailed the truth of Scriptures and the foundations of Creed belief\r\n(_mich und Gott_).... We order that henceforth you shall employ\r\nyour talents to better purpose and that you shall keep silence on\r\nmatters which are outside of your proper functions.” The further\r\ncirculation of the book was prohibited, but it is fair to remember that\r\nthis prohibition proved entirely ineffective to suppress the book, even\r\nin Prussia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Holland]\r\n\r\nThe States General of Holland issued in 1581, and again in 1588, edicts\r\nprohibiting the printing, the reading, and the possession of certain\r\ncondemned books, the lists of which were given with the edicts. These\r\nbooks were described as presenting “papistical superstitions.” In\r\n1598, certain Socinian books which had been printed in Amsterdam were\r\ncondemned as heretical by the theological professors of Leyden. The\r\neditions were confiscated and the books were publicly burned in The\r\nHague.\r\n\r\nAmong the noteworthy names included in the list of condemned authors\r\nmay be cited those of Vondel, Grotius (who was certainly not to be\r\nranked either as a Socinian or as an unbeliever, but whose form of\r\nCalvinism was not in accord with that of the authorities), Hobbes, and\r\nSpinoza. The poet Vondel, in 1641, went back into the Catholic Church\r\nand thereupon came under the proscription of the Synod of Delft as\r\nwell as of the State. Before he accepted the Catholic Faith, he was\r\naccused of being an Arminian and a supporter of Olden-Barneveld. Later,\r\nhis tragedy _Maria Stuart_, in which he declaimed against the\r\nmurder of the Catholic queen, brought him again into trouble with the\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nGrotius suffered much more severely from the persecution of his\r\nfellow-historians than from any action on the part of censors of the\r\nRoman Church. His friend Olden-Barneveld had lost his life largely\r\nbecause of differences on theological matters with certain of his\r\nfellow-Calvinists. The same fate would probably have befallen Grotius\r\nif he had not succeeded in escaping from prison.\r\n\r\nHobbes, when instructor in the University of Cambridge, having\r\nundertaken to defend certain propositions concerning the law of\r\nnature, was prohibited from further teaching and was driven from\r\nthe university. He betook himself to Amsterdam, but even here, the\r\n_Leviathan_, (printed in London, in 1651,) came under condemnation. The\r\nRoman censors are criticised (and with justice) for their prohibition\r\nof the writings of Spinoza, but the condemnation of Spinoza was much\r\nmore severe among his own people than anything that had been proposed\r\nby the authorities of Rome. The ban uttered in the Jewish temple on the\r\n27th of July, 1656, closes with the words:\r\n\r\n   “We order hereafter that no one shall have communication with\r\n   Baruch Espinoza either by word of mouth or in writing, that no\r\n   one shall render him any service, that no one shall remain under\r\n   the same roof with or even accost him, that no one shall in any\r\n   manner have communication with him.”\r\n\r\nThe works of Spinoza and the _Leviathan_ of Hobbes were brought\r\nunder a series of condemnations under the authority of the Prince of\r\nOrange, the States of Holland, the synods of the Church, the local\r\nmagistrates, the university authorities, and the Burgomaster of Leyden.\r\n\r\nIn 1668, Adrian Coerbach, a doctor of medicine of Amsterdam, was\r\ncharged with having accepted the opinions of Spinoza and with having\r\ndefended these before others. He gave evidence that he had never spoken\r\nwith Spinoza and had not spoken publicly of his theories. He was,\r\nhowever, sentenced to be imprisoned for ten years and thereafter to\r\nbe banished from Holland for ten years. In 1678, the Synod of South\r\nHolland, in session at Leyden, gave fresh judgment concerning the\r\npernicious writings of Spinoza. Between the years 1650–1680, there\r\nwere in all no less than fifty similar edicts or judgments, in some\r\ninstances accompanied by severe punishments, against the reading or\r\ncirculation of the works of Spinoza. In many cases, under the same\r\njudgment was placed the _Leviathan_ of Hobbes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Scandinavia]\r\n\r\nIn Denmark, between the years 1537 and 1770, a severe censorship was\r\nmaintained not only against works upholding the Catholic Faith, but\r\nagainst all books which were not in accord with the Lutheran doctrines\r\nthat the Crown had established as the orthodox faith of the kingdom.\r\nAmong books other than theological which came under condemnation, may\r\nbe noted the _Werther_ of Goethe, condemned in 1776. The severe\r\nprohibitions of the censorship law were not repealed until 1849 and\r\n1866. In Sweden also, where the Lutheran creed had been established\r\nas the faith of the kingdom, a censorship was maintained against\r\npublications which were not in accord with the creed of Luther. In\r\n1667, under a royal ordinance, the booksellers were directed to present\r\nfrom year to year to the censors a precise catalogue of all the books\r\ncarried in stock and to secure permission for the sale of such books.\r\nThe penalty was loss of license.\r\n\r\nIn 1764, was printed, at Upsala, an Index presenting a list of certain\r\nbooks which are held as prohibited in Sweden. It is to be classed as\r\nan historical tract and not strictly as an Index. The title reads as\r\nfollows: _Historia librorum prohibitorum in Suecia; cujus specimen\r\nprimum, consensu Ampl. Senat. Philos. Upsal. publica disputatione,\r\nsubmittunt Samuel J. Alnander, Philos. Magister, et Petrus Kendal,\r\nStipend. Reg. Ostrogothi, Anno mdcclxiii, Upsaliae._ The thesis\r\nrecognises three sources of the power of prohibiting books, the royal\r\nSenate, specified in the title-page; the royal authority by edict; and\r\nthe theological faculty of the University of Upsala. The lists are\r\ndevoted mainly to works of the 17th century but there are a few titles\r\nfrom the 16th century. The books condemned are chiefly political. The\r\nvolume has value chiefly as an indication of a system of censorship\r\nin a Protestant country and also (in connection with the meagreness\r\nof the lists) of the fact that such system was apparently neither\r\ncomprehensive nor exacting.\r\n\r\nIn 1856, was printed in Gothenburg, in an edition comprising but\r\nsixteen copies, an Index bearing the title, _Elenchus Librorum in\r\nSuecia prohibitorum, saeculorum XVII et XVIII_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Censorship by the State in England]\r\n\r\nThe first censorship in England appears to have been made as a matter\r\nof Church discipline; the bishops assumed in these earlier cases the\r\nsole jurisdiction and the punishments were ecclesiastical--penance and\r\nexcommunication. In 1382, the State began to take action in matters of\r\ncensorship. The occasion arose from the circulation of the doctrines\r\nof Wyclif, which, together with the teachings of the Lollards, were\r\nassumed to have had influence in bringing about the insurrection of Wat\r\nTyler. The authorities decided that the bishops did not have the power\r\nrequired to suppress the inflammatory doctrines, because the preachers\r\nkept moving from one diocese to another and denied at the same time\r\nthe jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts. In 1382, therefore, the\r\nParliament passed an act directing the civil authorities to arrest\r\nall such preachers and to “hold them in arrest and strong prison until\r\nthey will justify themselves to the law and reason of Holy Church.”\r\nThe mischief, however, continued and, in 1401, the more severe act\r\nknown as “_de haeretico comburendo_” was passed. Dr. Shirley says\r\nthat the first victim of this statute was W. Sawtree, preacher at\r\nSt. Osyth’s in the City of London. Sawtree was convicted of denying\r\ntransubstantiation. Milman points out that the writ for the execution\r\nof Sawtree appears on the Rolls of Parliament before the act itself.\r\nIt is possible, therefore, says Milman, that Sawtree suffered under\r\na special act which had perhaps been proposed for the purpose of\r\nascertaining, in advance of the consideration of the larger measure,\r\nthe feeling of Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe last instances of execution for heresy in England occurred in 1612,\r\nin which year Bartholomew Legate was burned at Smithfield for holding\r\nUnitarian opinions, and Edward Wightman was burned at Litchfield for\r\nholding no less than nine “damnable heresies.”\r\n\r\nThe papal Bull issued on June 19, 1520, for the destruction of the\r\npublications of Luther, Wolsey declined to enforce in England. It is\r\nprobable that if the Cardinal had been left to himself, the cruel\r\nproceedings which characterised the reign of Henry VIII would not have\r\nbeen instituted. It is the opinion of Froude that with Wolsey, heresy\r\nwas an error, while with More it was a crime.\r\n\r\nA prohibitory Index was published in England in 1526, nearly\r\ntwenty-five years before the issue of the first Index on the Continent,\r\nand thirty-three years before the first issue in the series of the\r\nRoman Indexes. In March, 1527, Tunstal, Bishop of London, gave to\r\nThomas More a privilege for the reading of heretical books in order\r\nthat, following the example of the King (Henry VIII), More might be\r\nenabled to make good defence of the Catholic Faith against the new\r\nheresies. In June, 1539, the King gave his approval to an act of\r\nParliament which was concerned particularly with the articles of faith.\r\nThe first of these articles had to do with the real presence of Christ\r\nin the Sacrament. The act reads: “If any person writes, preaches, or\r\ndisputes against this first article, he shall be punished with death as\r\na heretic and his property shall be confiscated to the Crown.”\r\n\r\nIn 1564, Queen Elizabeth issued an instruction to the Bishop of London\r\nto provide for an examination of the cargoes of all the vessels\r\narriving, in order that pernicious and heretical books should be\r\nsecured and destroyed. In 1571, an act of Parliament provided the\r\npunishment of treason against all who should secure from the Bishop of\r\nRome any bull, brief, or other instrument or should undertake to make\r\ndistribution of copies of the same. Under Elizabeth, it was ordered\r\nthat any person should be treated as guilty of high treason and should\r\nbe liable to sentence of death if he had in his possession a Catholic\r\nbook in which was taught the doctrine of the supremacy of the pope.\r\nIn 1582, an act of Parliament declared it to be felony to write,\r\nprint, sell, distribute, or possess books, rhymes, ballads, letters,\r\nor writings of any kind which contained matter against the fame of\r\nthe Queen or in any way injurious to the repute of the Government.\r\nUnder this law, two ministers belonging to the sect of the Brownists,\r\nThacher and Copping, were tried and executed. In 1575, Elizabeth\r\napproved a new act directed against the Anabaptists, the Puritans,\r\nthe Brownists, and the Catholics, under the provisions of which act a\r\nnumber of people were condemned and burned. Among the books prohibited\r\nunder the same law, were certain writings of Henry Nicholas of Leyden\r\nwhich had been translated from the German. It was ordered that any\r\npersons possessing or distributing these writings should be punished.\r\nIn 1583, a proclamation was issued by the Queen against the publishers,\r\nbooksellers, or possessors of pernicious and schismatic literature. The\r\nStar Chamber, under the law of 1585, prescribed that each university\r\nshould keep in activity but one press and prescribed from year to\r\nyear the number of presses permitted for London. In 1593, Barrow and\r\nGreenwood, both Brownists, were executed as heretics. It is the view of\r\nthe Jesuit historian Hilgers that throughout the whole of the reign of\r\nElizabeth there was a persistent and bloody persecution against freedom\r\nof thought of any kind. In 1594, Adfield and Carter suffered death\r\nbecause the former had brought into England a Catholic book and the\r\nlatter had had the same in his possession.\r\n\r\nA sect that fell under the displeasure of Queen Elizabeth was the\r\n“Family of Love.” The founder was a Dutch Anabaptist, born at Delft,\r\ncalled David George, but the leader whose influence was of the most\r\nimportance was Henry Nicolai of Münster. Nicolai gave out that his\r\nwritings were of equal authority with Holy Scripture. “Moses,” he says,\r\n“taught mankind to hope, Christ to believe, but Nicolai taught man to\r\nlove, which last is of more worth than both the former.” The Queen\r\nordered (in 1575) that all books and writings maintaining this doctrine\r\nshould be destroyed and burned and that possessors of such books should\r\nbe duly punished. In 1608, James I, in a proclamation concerning the\r\nsupervision of literature, says: “For better oversight of books of all\r\nsortes before they come to the presse, we have resolved to make choice\r\nof commissioners that shall looke more narrowly into the nature of all\r\nthose things that shall be put to the presse, either concerning our\r\nauthoritie royall or concerning our government, or the lawes of our\r\nKingdom.”[84]\r\n\r\nIn July, 1637, the Star Chamber published an act for the regulation of\r\nliterature which in the severity of its censorship can be compared only\r\nwith a procedure under Napoleon. It was prohibited to import or make\r\nsale of any books the influence of which was opposed to sound faith or\r\nto the authority of the Church or to the authority of government or\r\nto any rulers or to the interests of the community, or in which there\r\nshould be libels or attacks against any corporation or any individual\r\nperson. The penalties prescribed included fines, imprisonment, and\r\nbodily punishment, the decision to be made under the authority of the\r\nChamber. The printing of any book which had not secured the approval\r\nof the Chamber was forbidden under heavy penalties. Books in the\r\ndepartment of jurisprudence must be approved by the Chief Justice or by\r\nsome authority appointed by him; books on history and statecraft were\r\nto be approved by the Secretary of State; those on morals by the Lord\r\nMarshal; works on theology, philosophy, natural science, poetry, and\r\ngeneral literature, by the Archbishop of Canterbury or Bishop of London\r\nor by the chancellor of one of the two universities. Licenses were to\r\nbe issued for but twenty master printers outside of those appointed\r\ndirectly by the Crown and those allotted to the universities. No\r\nprinter was to operate more than two presses or was to have more than\r\ntwo apprentices. Should anybody undertake to operate a press without\r\nsecuring a license from the Chamber, he was liable to be placed in the\r\nstocks, to be flogged through the city, and, after judgment, to further\r\npenalties.\r\n\r\nIn 1638, Alexander Leighton was, under a judgment of the Star Chamber,\r\ncondemned in connection with a book entitled: _An Appeal to the\r\nParliament or Sion’s Plea against the Prelacie_. He was sentenced to\r\na fine of ten thousand pounds, to degradation from the ministry, and\r\nto be publicly whipped in the palace yard; he was made to stand two\r\nhours in the pillory, one ear was cut off, a nostril slit open, and\r\none of his cheeks branded with the letters S.S. (Sower of Sedition).\r\nA week later, he underwent a second whipping and a repetition of the\r\nmutilation. He was then left in prison for three years but, in 1641,\r\nhad the satisfaction of having his sentence reversed by the House of\r\nCommons. The book had declared the institution of Episcopacy to be\r\nanti-Christian and satanical and it accused the king with having been\r\ncorrupted by the bishops to the undoing of himself and his people.\r\n\r\nIn 1633, Prynne was condemned by the Star Chamber to be fined five\r\nthousand pounds, to be placed in the pillory, to be deprived of his\r\nears, and to perpetual imprisonment. The book on the ground of which\r\nthis punishment was administered was entitled: _The Histriomastix,\r\nthe player’s scourge or actor’s tragedies_. Lord Cottington, the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer, says in his judgment: “I do in the first\r\nplace begin censure with Prynne’s book. I condemn it to be burned by\r\nthe hangman,” etc. This is said to be the first instance in England in\r\nwhich a condemned publication was burned by the hangman. Prynne came\r\nagain under condemnation, in 1637, in connection with a book called the\r\n_Flagellum Pontificis et Episcoporum Latinorum_, which was said to\r\nhave been written in co-operation with J. Bastwick and H. Burton. I do\r\nnot find the record of Prynne’s punishment in this case, but Bastwick\r\nwas condemned by the High Commission court to pay a fine of one\r\nthousand pounds, to be excommunicated, to be debarred from the practice\r\nof his profession (medicine), and to remain in prison until he recanted\r\n(and that is, he says, “until domesday in the afternoone”).\r\n\r\nThe practice of burning books was continued by the Puritans, who also\r\nutilised for the purpose the services of the common hangman. One book\r\nso burned (in 1619) was the King’s _Book of Sports_, issued by\r\nJames in 1618, on the advice of Morton, Bishop of Chester. It had been\r\nordered to be read in all churches throughout England. Copies were\r\npublicly burned in a number of the Puritan counties.\r\n\r\nThe regulations for the control of the press in England were more\r\nstrenuous under the Commonwealth and the later Stuarts than before the\r\ndeath of Charles I. Between the years 1637–1681, more than two hundred\r\nbooks came upon the condemnation lists. Among the works condemned\r\nand prohibited by Cromwell was the _Areopagitica_ of Milton,\r\npublished in 1644. In 1646, was condemned the book by John Biddle\r\n(known as the father of modern Unitarianism) which bore the title:\r\n_Twelve Arguments from Scripture in regard to the Divinity of the\r\nHoly Ghost_. The author was imprisoned and the copies of the book\r\nburned. The censor of the press under the last two Stuarts was Roger\r\nL’Estrange. The penalties in force at the time he assumed the office\r\nproviding for the destruction of books, the imprisonment and in certain\r\ncases the death of the authors and printers, were, in his judgment, not\r\nsufficiently severe. He beseeched Parliament to give him authority to\r\nadd to these penalties stocks, public whipping, the cutting off of the\r\nhand, the cutting out of the tongue, etc. A printer named Trogan, who\r\ncame under the disapproval of the censor, was executed in 1686, with\r\nvarious revolting details.\r\n\r\nIn 1642, the Parliament condemned and ordered burned by the hangman\r\nfive publications written by Royalists. In each succeeding year,\r\nsimilar action was taken with publications (mainly pamphlets) written\r\nin opposition to the control of Parliament. A more serious matter for\r\nthe authors than the burning of the books was that of the fines. Joseph\r\nPrimatt, for instance, in 1652, was fined five thousand pounds for the\r\npublication of a petition to Parliament, and Lilburne was in the same\r\nyear fined seven thousand pounds. The first theological work dealt\r\nwith by Parliament was a treatise by John Archer entitled _Comfort\r\nfor believers about their Sinnes and Troubles_. This was published\r\nin 1645 and in the same year was, under the order of Parliament,\r\npublicly burned in four places. In September, 1650, a monograph by\r\nLawrence Clarkson entitled _Single Eye, All light, no darkness_,\r\nwas condemned to be burned by the hangman and Clarkson, after being\r\nimprisoned for a month, was sentenced to banishment for life. These\r\ninstances are selected from a long series of similar condemnations\r\nmerely in order to make clear that the theory of the Parliament in\r\nregard to the right and the duty of the Government to prevent the\r\ncirculation of pernicious literature (that is to say, literature the\r\nopinions of which were not in accord with those of the existing\r\nauthorities) differed in no way from that of the supporters of royalty.\r\nA similar series of condemnations, with burning of the books and fining\r\nof the authors, together with an occasional exposure in the pillory,\r\nwas continued through the Restoration. In the year 1690, a treatise by\r\nArthur Bury, rector of Exeter College, Oxford, issued under the title\r\nof the _Naked Gospels_, was ordered burned under the authority of\r\nthe University of Oxford.\r\n\r\nIn 1698, a Scotchman named Aikenhead, who was at the time a student\r\nof but eighteen years of age, was hanged at Edinburgh, not on account\r\nof any heresies brought into print, but simply because in some wild\r\ntalk he had referred to Christianity as a delusion. Under one of the\r\nstatutes of Scotland, it was a capital crime to revile or to curse\r\nthe Supreme Being or any person of the Trinity. The words used by the\r\nyoung man were not strictly within the definition of the statute, but\r\nthis statute was, under the direction of James Stuart, Lord Advocate of\r\nScotland, used to bring the boy to execution.[85]\r\n\r\nThe censorship laws were not repealed as an immediate result of the\r\nRevolution of 1688 but endured until 1695. The regulations then\r\nestablished maintained for the Crown the full authority to control the\r\noperations of the press, but the penalties were made much less severe.\r\nAmong the books condemned under the new legislation were _Christianity\r\nnot Mysterious_, by John Toland, _Thoughts concerning Human Souls_, by\r\nWilliam Coward, and the _Fable of the Bees_, by Mandeville, in 1723.\r\n(The last had been published as far back as 1706). Mandeville’s volume\r\nwas made the subject of a presentment by the Grand Jury of Middlesex.\r\nThe book was described as “a public nuisance, having a tendency to the\r\nsubversion of all religion, the undermining of civil government, and\r\nthe impairment of our duty to the Almighty.” No penalty was inflicted,\r\nor ordered, upon the author, nor was the book itself suppressed.[86]\r\n\r\nAmong the books condemned in the succeeding years were _The Doctrine\r\nof the Trinity_, by Samuel Clark, and the _Miracle of Our Saviour_, by\r\nThomas Woolston. The author of the latter was fined twenty-five pounds\r\nand was then imprisoned until he could raise two thousand pounds. He\r\ndied after four years’ imprisonment.\r\n\r\nIn 1701, a treatise by John Asgill on the _Covenant of Eternal Life_\r\nwas burned by the order of two Parliaments, English and Irish. In 1702,\r\nthe famous essay by Defoe, _The Shortest Way with the Dissenters_, was\r\nburned by the hangman under order of Parliament and Defoe was sentenced\r\nto three days’ punishment in the pillory, to a ruinous fine, and to a\r\nlong imprisonment. The trial of Saccheverell brought about the burning,\r\nin 1710, of a long series of books, including his own sermons and\r\nworks by both his supporters and adversaries. In 1707, the Grand Jury\r\nof Middlesex made a presentment characterising as a public nuisance\r\nthe essay by Matthew Tyndale entitled the _Rights of the Christian\r\nChurch_. Tyndale reflects that this proceeding will further “the wider\r\ncirculation of one of the best books that have been published in our\r\nage among many people that would not otherwise have heard of it.” It\r\nwas burned by the hangman in 1710. In 1722, the Commons agreed with\r\nthe resolution of the Peers to have burned at the Royal Exchange the\r\ndeclaration of the Pretender issued as the declaration of James III.\r\nIn 1763, numbers of the _North Briton_, of John Wilkes, who was then\r\nhimself a member of the House, were, under an order of the two Houses,\r\ncondemned to be burned at the Royal Exchange. The author was expelled\r\nfrom the House, but secured, after a long contest, a re-election. A\r\nvolume issued without name in 1775, under the title of _The present\r\nCrisis in regard to America considered_, was burned on the 24th of\r\nFebruary of that year and is referred to as the last book which the\r\nEnglish Parliament has condemned to the flames.\r\n\r\nIn 1795, Sheridan proposes to have publicly burned a treatise by Reeve\r\nentitled _Thoughts on English Government_, but his proposal was not\r\nsupported. The press law, passed as late as December, 1819, imposed a\r\npenalty of transportation on the writers or printers of godless and\r\nrevolutionary works. This law was repealed in 1837, and the legislation\r\nof 1869 finally secured an assured freedom for the press. It is the\r\nconclusion of Catholic writers, in summing up the history of what they\r\ncall the exceptionally fierce and brutal censorship of England, that\r\nthe responsibility for this rests with the original crime committed\r\nby the State against the Church universal; and with the continued and\r\ndemoralising wrong caused by transferring the control of the Church to\r\nthe civil authorities.\r\n\r\nThe history of political censorship, or of censorship by the State in\r\nEngland, is a large and complex subject to which in a work like this it\r\nis of course, possible only to make reference.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 was printed (privately) in London a catalogue which from\r\nthe title has been classed with the Indexes: _Index librorum\r\nprohibitorum_; being notes bio-, biblio-, and icono-graphical and\r\ncritical on curious and uncommon books, compiled by Pisanus Fraxi. This\r\nis, however, simply a list, probably prepared for commercial purposes,\r\nof obscene books.\r\n\r\n\r\n=4. Summary.=--The instances cited are sufficient to show that\r\nthe spirit of Protestantism, in each and all of the sects that came\r\ninto power or influence in the State, has through the past centuries\r\nheld it to be the right and duty of the Church, and of the State\r\nunder the influence of the Church, to supervise and to control the\r\nproductions of the printing-press and the reading of the people. The\r\nfact, however, that within the Protestant communion there were so\r\nmany points of view, rendered it not only difficult but impossible to\r\nestablish any consistent and continuing policy of censorship. There\r\nwas also a lack of any effective machinery for carrying out, within\r\nthese Protestant territories, such regulations as the censors of the\r\nChurch might establish. In certain places and at certain times the\r\ncivil authorities, like the magistrates of Geneva or the Elector of\r\nSaxony, were ready to utilise the force of the State for carrying out\r\nthe decrees of the Church, but such co-operation and support were\r\nat best (or at worst) but intermittent and spasmodic. In Germany or\r\nin Switzerland, the authority of the State covered but a limited\r\nterritory. If the censorship pressure became burdensome in one city,\r\nthere was no essential difficulty in moving the composing-room and the\r\npress to some other place where the faith of the magistrates was not\r\nso “orthodox” or so strenuous. As a result, the Protestant writers,\r\nrepresenting all schools of protest, found no continued difficulty in\r\nbringing their productions into print and in circulating these among\r\nsympathetic readers.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuit historian, while admitting that the condemnation of the\r\nCatholic Church has fallen upon certain works of unquestioned scholarly\r\nvalue, insists that the Protestant censorship of authors and books\r\nof similar standing has been, to say the least, no less severe. He\r\nmaintains, further, that the Catholic policy and methods have been more\r\nconsistent, more discriminating, more intelligent, and more moral in\r\npurpose and in effect than those of the Protestants. He emphasises the\r\nimportance of distinguishing between the circles of readers for which\r\ndifferent books are fitted, either to do service or to work injury. He\r\nwrites: “The works of Grotius, Gibbon, and Guicciardini have a deserved\r\nrepute with the scholars. We may admit, that scholars can derive from\r\nsuch works valuable instruction, but this does not make them suitable\r\nfor the reading of the untrained or the half trained. The Church\r\nundertakes always to maintain this distinction.”\r\n\r\nThe Father sums up his arraignment of the censorship of the State by a\r\nbitter reference to the methods pursued by the Protestant Government\r\nof Prussia with its Catholic subjects in Poland. What answer can an\r\ninstructor make in a school in Posen when a child asks why he is\r\nforbidden to read the Polish Catechism? The instructor can only say\r\nthat the modern State is all powerful, and that in the execution of its\r\nself-imposed task of crushing out nationality, it is willing to take\r\nthe responsibility not only for the interpretation of science, but for\r\nthe shaping of belief.[87]\r\n\r\n“Whence,” says Hilgers, “do the civil authorities secure the right to\r\ncompel Catholic children to accept instruction from heretical books;\r\nand to prohibit the use in Catholic families, outside even of the walls\r\nof the official institutions, the use of Catholic books and documents?\r\nHere is a censorship tyranny with which in the history of Rome there is\r\nnothing to be compared.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n             THE BOOK PRODUCTION OF EUROPE AS AFFECTED BY\r\n                              CENSORSHIP\r\n\r\n   1.

General.=--Four men, Columbus, Luther, Copernicus, and Gutenberg,\r\nstand at the dividing line of the Middle Ages, and serve as boundary\r\nstones marking the entrance of mankind into the higher and finer epoch\r\nof its development.[88] It would be difficult to say which one of the\r\nfour has made the larger contribution to this development or has done\r\nthe most to lift up the spirit of mankind and to open for man the\r\ndoors to the new realms that were awaiting him. The Genoese discoverer\r\nopens new regions to our knowledge and imagination, leads Europe from\r\nthe narrow restrictions of the Middle Ages out into the vast space\r\nof Western oceans, and, in adding to the material realm controlled\r\nby civilisation, widens still more largely the range of its thought,\r\nand fancy. The reformer of Wittenberg, in breaking the bonds that had\r\nchained the spirits of his fellow-men and in securing for them again\r\ntheir rights as individual Christians, conquers for them a spiritual\r\nrealm and brings them into direct relations with their Creator. The\r\ngreat astronomer shatters, through his discoveries, the fixed and\r\npetty conceptions of the universe that had ruled the minds of mankind,\r\nand in bringing to men fresh light on the nature and extent of created\r\nthings, widens at the same time their whole understanding of themselves\r\nand of duty. The citizen of Mayence may claim to have unchained\r\nintelligence and given to it wings. He utilised lead no longer as a\r\ndeath-bringing ball, but in the form of life-quickening letters which\r\nwere to bring before thousands of minds the teachings of the world’s\r\nthinkers. Each one of the four had his part in bringing to the world\r\nlight, knowledge, and development.\r\n\r\nBefore the beginning of the Reformation, the business of printing\r\nbooks, which had originated among Germans, had secured in the so-called\r\nLatin countries, Italy, France, and Spain, larger development than\r\nin the German lands. It is certainly the case that, irrespective\r\nof the facilities afforded by the printing-press, the intellectual\r\ndevelopment in Italy was, during the 15th and the first portion of\r\nthe 16th century, far in advance of Germany and for that matter of\r\nthe rest of Europe. If the Reformation was not in itself an important\r\nfactor in the transfer of the centre of literary activity, this period\r\ncertainly coincided with such transfer. After 1518, the centres of\r\nliterary production and intellectual activities are to be sought rather\r\nin Germany and in Holland than in Italy or Spain. France, on the other\r\nhand, appears to have been able, while accepting a rather burdensome\r\nmeasure of censorship, to have retained an important intellectual\r\nposition, the influence of which is, of course, most closely associated\r\nwith the university of Paris.\r\n\r\nDuring the years immediately following the invention of printing,\r\nthe Church gave to the new art a cordial welcome. The scholarly\r\necclesiastics were among the first to recognise the service that could\r\nbe rendered by the printers in multiplying for general distribution\r\nthe books of doctrine and of devotion. The Church felt secure in its\r\nhold upon the minds of the people and for three quarters of a century,\r\nat least, there was no apprehension that the people could be diverted\r\nfrom their allegiance to the true Faith. Many of the monasteries\r\nmade space for printing-presses, while others placed funds at the\r\ndisposal of printers who were needing co-operation. It was not only in\r\nthe scholarly circles of the Church that the new art secured prompt\r\nrecognition. The Brothers of Common Life, who for a century or more\r\nhad taken upon themselves the work of teaching the people and who\r\nhad utilised in this work manuscript copies of books of devotion,\r\nwere among the first to make use of the printing-press in the work\r\nof education for the distribution of their books of devotion. Within\r\neighteen years after the production of Gutenberg’s Bible, the Brothers\r\nhad printing-presses at work in Deventer (Holland) and in a number of\r\ntheir monasteries in North Germany. In Strasburg, Magdeburg, Nuremberg,\r\nand elsewhere before 1470, the monasteries of the Carthusians had\r\nestablished printing-presses.\r\n\r\nThe work of publishing material for popular circulation begins\r\npractically with the Reformation. It was with the great popular demand\r\nfor instruction and information which had been developed through the\r\nwork of the reformers, that there came to the people at large the\r\nrealisation of the value to them of the invention of Gutenberg, and\r\nan understanding of its importance for the work of educating and of\r\norganising the people and for the securing the right of individual\r\nthought production against the oppression of Church and State. The\r\nsystem of censorship, ecclesiastical and political, a system which was\r\nto do much to hamper the development of literature and of publishing,\r\ndates in substance from the Reformation.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the censorship of the Church on the activities of\r\npublishers and on the production of books varied very materially, even\r\nin those States in which the regulations of the Church were, in form\r\nat least, accepted as authoritative. The States in which, during the\r\n16th and 17th centuries, the work of the printer-publishers came into\r\nconflict, in one way or another, with the censorship edicts, and in\r\nwhich literary production and activity were influenced by censorship\r\npolicy, were: Italy, France, South Germany, North Germany, Switzerland,\r\nEngland, Spain, the Spanish Netherlands, and Holland.\r\n\r\nIn Italy, the edicts of the Roman Inquisition and of the Congregation\r\nof the Index having to do with the prohibition or the expurgation of\r\nbooks were of course, at least in form, binding equally upon all the\r\nStates and cities in which printing-presses were at work. As a fact,\r\nhowever, at no time, not even after the labours of the Council of\r\nTrent, did it prove practicable to secure any uniformity of procedure\r\nor of result in the enforcement of the censorship decrees throughout\r\nthe territory of the Italian peninsula. The printers of Rome were under\r\nobligation to take immediate action in regard to the cancellation\r\nor withdrawal from sale of books condemned. Outside of Rome, or at\r\nleast outside of the States of the Church, periods of from thirty to\r\nninety days were allowed within which the printers were expected to\r\nsecure knowledge of the prohibitory edicts. The Church authorities\r\nassumed that these edicts were binding throughout the entire Catholic\r\nworld, but, outside of Italy, the printers, booksellers, or readers\r\nwere not under obligation to have knowledge of the prohibitions until\r\nthe edicts had been published by the local bishops or the local\r\ninquisitors. It was the case that from time to time the local bishops\r\nwere not in sympathetic accord with the literary policy of Rome, and\r\ndelayed indefinitely, or declined altogether, to make publication of\r\nthe edicts. In certain of the Italian cities, of which Venice is the\r\nmost noteworthy example, the civil authorities took the ground that no\r\nregulations concerning printing and bookselling could be considered\r\nas in force unless and until such regulations had been confirmed\r\nby the civil authorities. The Church claimed not only the right to\r\nprohibit pernicious literature, but to authorise and to protect for\r\nsale throughout the world the works which secured its approval. The\r\npapal privileges conceded, in form at least, to the printers to whom\r\nthey were issued, exclusive control not only within the States of\r\nthe Church, but in all the States of the world that acknowledged the\r\nauthority of the Church. There was, however, practically no machinery\r\nfor enforcing the authority of the papal privileges. The material\r\nadvantage belonging to such a privilege was that it carried with it\r\nthe assurance of the approval of the Church concerning the character\r\nof the book. It constituted, namely, evidence that the book had\r\nsecured the approval of the Church censors and (with an occasional\r\nexception) it preserved the book from interference on the part of local\r\necclesiastical censors, whose prejudices were usually more bitter and\r\nwhose ignorant dread of heretical scholarship was greater than was the\r\ncase with the censors appointed directly by the Congregation. The\r\nfact that, during the 16th and 17th centuries, Latin was the official\r\nlanguage of scholarship and nearly universal as the language of\r\nliterature, and that the great majority of publications of importance\r\ncame into print in Latin, served to maintain a certain universality\r\nof learning, of literature, and of science and to build up a body of\r\nscholars who belonged not to any one State, least of all possible to\r\nthe “country of origin,” but to Europe as a whole, to the world of\r\nliterature and learning. The detail of smallest importance that occurs\r\nin thinking of the career of a Casaubon, Scaliger, or an Erasmus\r\nis the place of his birth. This universality of language furthered\r\nalso, however, during the same centuries, the operations of the\r\necclesiastical censors and the enforcement of the policy of censorship.\r\nWhen there came to be a development of national literatures brought\r\ninto print in the national languages, the difficulties of a standard of\r\ncensorship and of a general enforcement of such standard, even through\r\nthe States recognising the authority of the Church, became very much\r\ngreater. It is evident, in fact, from the fragmentary additions of the\r\nlists of the later Indexes that the examiners, acting on behalf of the\r\nCongregation or of the Inquisition, had very little familiarity with\r\nliterature that came into print in language other than Latin or Italian.\r\n\r\nThe art of printing was one which evidently could not long be\r\nrestricted to any one locality. It was speedily carried from Mayence to\r\nother communities in which literary interests or educational facilities\r\ncould be furthered by its use.\r\n\r\nIn 1462, on the 28th of October, Archbishop Adolph of Nassau captured\r\nthe city of Mayence and gave it over to his soldiers for plunder. The\r\ntypesetters and printers, with all the other artisans whose work\r\ndepended upon the commerce of the city, were driven to flight and it\r\nappeared for the moment as if the newly instituted printing business\r\nhad been crushed. The result of the scattering of the printers was,\r\nhowever, the introduction of the new art into a number of other\r\ncentres where the influences were favourable for its development. The\r\ntypesetters of Mayence, driven from their printing offices by the\r\nheavy hand of the Church, journeyed throughout the world and proceeded\r\nto give to many communities the means of education and enlightenment\r\nthrough which the great revolt against the Church was finally\r\ninstituted.\r\n\r\nAn important influence in securing for the work of the early\r\nprinter-publishers of Germany a greater freedom from restriction than\r\nwas enjoyed by their contemporaries in France was the fact that, in\r\nGermany, the beginning of printing, or at least its development,\r\ntook place, not in a university centre but in a commercial town and\r\nwas from the outset carried on not by scholars but by workers of the\r\npeople. This brought the whole business of the production and the\r\ndistribution of books in Germany into closer relations with the mass\r\nof the people than was the case in France. The direct association with\r\nthe university of the first printers in France (who were themselves the\r\nimmediate successors of the official university scribes) brought the\r\nprinting-press under the direct control of the university and rendered\r\neasy the establishment by the university authorities, and particularly\r\nby the theologians, of a continued censorship.\r\n\r\nHegel, in his _Philosophy of History_, refers to the renewed interest\r\nin the writings of the ancients which was brought about through the\r\nservice of the printing-press. He points out, further, that the Church\r\nfelt at the outset no anxiety concerning the influence of the pagan\r\nliterature and that the ecclesiastical authorities evidently had no\r\nunderstanding of the new elements of suggestion and enquiry that this\r\nliterature was introducing into the minds of men. It may be considered\r\nas one of the fortunate circumstances attending the introduction of the\r\nart of printing that the popes of the time were largely men of liberal\r\neducation and intellectual tastes, while one or two, such as Nicholas\r\nV, Julius II, and Leo X, had a keen personal interest in literature\r\nand were themselves creators of books. The fact that Leo X was a\r\nluxury-loving, free-thinking prince rather than a devoted Christian\r\nleader or teacher, may very probably have been a favourable influence\r\nfor the enlightenment and development of his own generation and of the\r\ngenerations that were to come. An earnest and narrow-minded head of the\r\nChurch could, during the first years of the 16th century, have retarded\r\nnot a little the development of the work of producing books for the\r\ncommunity at large.\r\n\r\nIt was a number of years before the dread of the use of the\r\nprinting-press for the spread of heretical doctrines, and of a\r\nconsequent undermining of the authority of the Church, assumed such\r\nproportions in the minds of the popes in Rome and with the bishops\r\nelsewhere as to cause the influence of the Church to be used against\r\nthe interests of the world of literature. As a result of this early\r\nacceptance by the Church of the printing-press as a useful ally and\r\nservant, the first Italian presses were supported by bishops and\r\ncardinals in the work of producing classics for scholarly readers,\r\nwhile at the other extremity of the Church organisation, and at a\r\ndistance of a thousand miles or more from Rome, the Brothers of Common\r\nLife in the Low Countries were using their presses for the distribution\r\nof cheap books among the people. Many citations could be made of the\r\napproval with which the scholarly ecclesiastics of the time regarded\r\nthe new art. Felix Fabri, prior of the Dominican monastery in Ulm, says\r\nin his _Historia Suevorum_, issued in the year 1459, that “no art\r\nthat the world has known can be considered so useful, so much to be\r\nesteemed, indeed so divine as that which has now, through the Grace\r\nof God, been discovered in Mayence.” Johannes Rauchler,[89] the first\r\nrector of the Tübingen School, rejoices that through the new art so\r\nmany authors can now be brought within the reach of students in Latin,\r\nGreek, and Hebrew, authors who are witnesses for the Christian faith,\r\nand the service of whose writings to the Church and to the world is so\r\ngreat that he can but consider “this art as a gift directly from God\r\nhimself.”\r\n\r\nThe favourable relations between the Church and the printers were\r\nchecked by the Humanistic movement, which, a generation or more\r\nbefore the Reformation, began to bring into question the authority\r\nof the Church and the infallibility of the Papacy. The influence of\r\nthe Humanistic teachers was so largely furthered by the co-operation\r\nof the printers that the jealousy and dread of the ecclesiastical\r\nauthorities were promptly aroused, and they began to utter fulminations\r\nagainst the wicked and ignorant men who were using the art of printing\r\nfor misleading the community and for the circulation of error.\r\nEcclesiastics who had at first favoured the widest possible circulation\r\nof the Scriptures, now contended that much of the spread of heresy was\r\ndue to the misunderstanding of the Scriptures on the part of readers\r\nwho were acting without the guidance of their spiritual advisers.\r\nThe Church now took the ground that the reading of the Scriptures by\r\nindividuals was not to be permitted and that the Bible was to be given\r\nto the community only through the interpretations of the Church. At\r\nthe same time, the authority of the Church was exerted to repress\r\nor at least to restrict the operations of the printing-press and to\r\nbring printers and publishers under a close ecclesiastical supervision\r\nand censorship. It was, however, already too late to stand between\r\nthe printing-press and the people. Large portions of the community\r\nhad become accustomed to a general circulation of books and to the\r\nuse without restriction of such reading matter as might be brought\r\nwithin their reach, and this privilege they were no longer willing\r\nto forego. In Spain, in Italy, and in France, the censorship of the\r\nChurch soon became sufficiently burdensome to hamper and to interfere\r\nwith publishing undertakings and to check the natural development of\r\nliterary production. Even in Italy, however, the critical spirit was\r\nfound to be too strong to be crushed out, and from Venice, which became\r\nthe most important of the Italian publishing centres (because it was\r\nthe freest from papal control) it proved possible to secure for the\r\nproductions of the printing-press a circulation that was practically\r\nindependent of the censorship of Rome.\r\n\r\nThe importance of Frankfort as a centre of the trade in books\r\nbegan with the first years of the 15th century, when the dealers\r\nin manuscripts were present with booths at the Frankfort Fair. The\r\nmanuscript dealers came together once a year also at the fairs of\r\nSalzburg, Ulm, and Nordlingen, but the book-trade at Frankfort soon\r\nassumed a pre-eminence that it did not lose for two centuries. The\r\nearliest date at which is chronicled the sale at the Frankfort Fair\r\nof printed books was 1480. For these earlier sales of manuscripts\r\nand printed books, there was apparently no censorship or official\r\nsupervision.\r\n\r\nThe manuscript trade in the Netherlands was more important both in\r\ncharacter and in extent than that carried on in Germany, and it\r\nappears to have exerted a larger influence upon the general education\r\nof the people than the book-trade of the time in either France or\r\nItaly. In France and in Italy, the earlier book-trade, first in\r\nmanuscripts, later in printed volumes, was connected with the work\r\nof the universities. In the Low Countries, on the other hand, and\r\nparticularly in such centres as Ghent, Antwerp, and Bruges, there came\r\ninto existence during the first half of the 15th century an active\r\nand intelligently conducted business in the production of books, both\r\nof a scholarly and of a popular character, the sale of which was made\r\namong citizens who were for the greater part outside of university\r\ncircles. One reason why the trade in books found a larger development\r\nin Belgium than in Germany was the greater wealth of the working\r\nclasses in the Low Countries. With the wealth, came cultivation and a\r\ntaste for luxuries and among luxuries soon came to be included art and\r\nliterature. Another factor in the early development of the book-trade\r\nwas the freedom from the university censorship control which in Paris,\r\nBologna, and other book-producing centres restricted the undertakings\r\nof the dealers.\r\n\r\nA special characteristic of the literary undertakings of the 16th\r\ncentury is the practice of collaboration. Such works as the great\r\ndictionary of the Academy and the _Corpus inscriptionum latinarum_\r\nare instances of undertakings which would have been impossible for\r\nindividual authorship. The Catholic reformation was also contemporary\r\nwith an important development in literary form and in literary\r\nexpression. It is fair to remember, however, that for this development\r\nthe influence of the Italian writers of the Renaissance may be\r\nconsidered as chiefly responsible.\r\n\r\nThe Renaissance, the influence of which in Germany had been so large a\r\nfactor in bringing about the Protestant Reformation, had not succeeded\r\nin Italy in revitalising paganism, but the Italian writers of the time\r\nbroke away from the traditions of Christianity. Their Deity was no\r\nlonger the sombre avenger invoked by Dante; or the consoler who, in the\r\nverse of Petrarch, reunites the souls that have been purified under\r\nsuffering and have endured the separation of death. It was Art. The\r\nreligion of Ariosto may be summed up as the development of literary\r\nperfection coupled with an indifference to moral ideas.[90]\r\n\r\nThe rule of Alexander VI (Borgia), 1492–1503, coincided with the\r\nbeginning of the active work of the printing-presses in Venice,\r\nFlorence, and in Rome. The influence of the Pope was, however,\r\npromptly brought to bear to discourage the undertakings of the\r\nprinter-publishers. Venice was practically outside of his control,\r\nwhile even in Florence the printers were not prepared to accept\r\ndictation from the papal representatives. In Rome, however, the\r\nsubjection of the press to ecclesiastical censorship, for the\r\ninitiation of which the responsibility rested with Alexander, proved\r\nat once a serious limitation to its activities. It was undoubtedly\r\nthis restriction which gave to the printers of Venice their great\r\nadvantage over their early competitors in Rome. Venice was the leader\r\namong the cities of Italy in resisting the censorship of the Church,\r\nalthough even in Venice the Church succeeded in the end in gaining\r\nthe more important of its contentions. In Spain, the control over the\r\nprinting-presses on the part of the censors of the Church was hardly\r\nquestioned, but these censors represented the authority not of Rome\r\nbut of the local Inquisition. The Spanish Inquisition was, for the\r\nlonger period of its existence under the direction of the Dominicans,\r\nand it was frequently the case that the decisions of the Spanish\r\ninquisitors, in regard both to the literature to be condemned and to\r\nthat to be approved, were in direct opposition to the conclusions of\r\nthe Papacy. In France, after a century of contest, the ecclesiastical\r\ncontrol of the printing-press became practically merged in the\r\ncensorship exercised by the Crown, a censorship which was in itself\r\nas much as the publishing trade could bear and continue to exist. In\r\nAustria and in South Germany, after the crushing out of the various\r\nReformation movements, the Church and the State worked in practical\r\naccord in maintaining a close supervision of the printing-presses. In\r\nNorth Germany, on the other hand, the ecclesiastical censorship never\r\nbecame important. The evils produced by it were, however, serious and\r\nlong-enduring over a large portion of the territory of Europe, and\r\nthe papal Borgia, although by no means a considerable personage, must\r\nbe held responsible for bringing into existence an evil which assumed\r\nenormous proportions in the intellectual history of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n=2. The Universities and the Book-trade.= The book-dealers of Paris,\r\nbeginning their work as part of the organisation of the university,\r\nhad their first quarters in the immediate vicinity of the college\r\nbuildings. The foundation of the College of the Sorbonne dates from\r\n1257. The college had been instituted by Robert de Sorbon, chaplain to\r\nLouis IX, from whom it took its name. It was at once affiliated to the\r\nuniversity, the work of which had begun about half a century earlier.\r\nThe college assumed the control of the theological instruction in the\r\nuniversity and the divines of the Sorbonne exercised from the outset\r\na controlling influence over the general policy of the university.\r\nThe theological faculty took charge, on behalf of the university,\r\nof the censorship of the Paris book-trade and of the productions of\r\nthe Paris press. It based its authority for this censorship in part\r\non the fact that the book-dealers had from the earliest manuscript\r\nperiod been under the direction of the university, and in part on the\r\nauthority of the Church. The dealers who did not secure a license\r\nfrom the university occupied as their locality the precincts of\r\nNotre Dame on the island of La Cité. Throughout Europe, in fact, the\r\nearlier book-dealers carried on their business very frequently under\r\nthe immediate shadow of the cathedral if not within its portals. In\r\nCologne, for instance, the manuscript-dealers in the early part of\r\nthe 15th century took possession for their shops or booths of various\r\ncorners or angles of the cathedral building; while in Münster was\r\nallotted to them the court immediately in front of the cathedral. There\r\nis a reference as early as 1408, in one of the Strasburg chronicles, to\r\nthe scribes who sold books on the steps of the Cathedral of Our Lady.\r\n\r\nWith the invention of printing, the universities (with the exception\r\nof Paris) lost their control over the business of book production, and\r\nthere resulted necessarily a decrease in their influence and relative\r\nimportance in the community. They continued to lay claim to the control\r\nof censorship but this claim could not be supported in the face of the\r\ndirect action of the Church on the one hand, and that of the civil\r\nauthorities on the other. Paulsen[91] writes: “The tradition of the\r\nuniversities, and, in particular, their method of instruction in the\r\narts and in theology, were rejected with scorn by the new educator\r\nthrough its representatives, the poets and the orators,” to whom the\r\nform and the substance of this teaching seemed alike to be barbarism.\r\nThe _Epistolae obscurorum virorum_, published in 1516, was the\r\nwork of a band of youthful poets working under the leadership of\r\nMutianus at Erfurt; it expressed the hatred and detestation felt by the\r\nHumanists for the ancient university system. Within a few years from\r\nthe publication of the _Epistolae_, the influence of the Humanists\r\nhad so far extended itself as to have effected a large modification in\r\nthe systems of study in all the larger universities. The ecclesiastical\r\nLatin was replaced by classical Latin; and the old translations of\r\nthe Aristotelian texts were driven out by new versions representing\r\nmore exact scholarship. Greek was taken up in the faculty of arts, and\r\ncourses in its language and literature were established in nearly all\r\nthe universities. This change was coincident with the shifting of the\r\nauthority for censorship from the hands of the university theologians\r\nto those of the direct representatives of the pope or of the State.\r\n\r\nThe strifes and contentions of the Reformation checked for a time the\r\ndevelopment in the universities of the studies connected with the\r\nintellectual movement of the Renaissance, and lessened the demand for\r\nthe literature of these studies. The active-minded were absorbed in\r\ntheological controversy, while those who could not understand the\r\nquestions at issue could still shout the shibboleths of the leaders.\r\nAs Erasmus puts it, rather bitterly: _ubi regnat Lutheranismus, ibi\r\ninteritus litterarum_. The literature of the Reformation, however,\r\nitself did much to make good for the printing-presses the lessened\r\ndemand for the classics, while, a few years later, the organisation in\r\nGermany of the Protestant schools and universities aroused intellectual\r\nactivities in new regions and created fresh requirements for printed\r\nbooks. Within half a century of the Diet of Worms, the centre of the\r\nbook-absorbing population of Germany had been transferred from the\r\nCatholic States of the south to the Protestant territories of the north\r\nand the literary preponderance of the latter has continued to increase\r\nduring the succeeding generations.\r\n\r\nMark Pattison says[92]:\r\n\r\n   “If we ask why Italy did not continue to be the centre of the\r\n   Humanist movement which she had so brilliantly encouraged, the\r\n   answer is that the intelligence was crushed by the reviviscence\r\n   of ecclesiastical ideas. Learning is the result of research, and\r\n   research must be free and cannot co-exist with the claim of the\r\n   Catholic religion to be superior to enquiry. The French school,\r\n   it will be observed, was wholly, in fact or in intention,\r\n   Protestant. As soon as it was decided (as it was before 1600)\r\n   that France was to be a Catholic country and the University\r\n   of Paris a Catholic University, learning was extinguished in\r\n   France. France saw without regret and without repentance the\r\n   expatriation of her unrivalled scholars. With Scaliger and\r\n   Saumaise, the seat of learning was transferred from France to\r\n   Holland.\r\n\r\n   The third period of classical learning thus coincides with the\r\n   Dutch school. From 1593, the date of Scaliger’s removal to\r\n   Leyden, the supremacy in the republic of learning was possessed\r\n   by the Dutch. In the course of the 18th century, the Dutch\r\n   school was gradually supplanted by the North German, which from\r\n   that time forward has taken, and still possesses, the lead in\r\n   philological science.”\r\n\r\nAs early as 1323, the University of Paris was the most important in\r\nEurope for theological studies, as that of Bologna was the authority on\r\njurisprudence, and that of Padua for medicine. The early development\r\nof theological studies in Paris was one of the influences that brought\r\nabout the authority of the College of the Sorbonne in the censorship of\r\nthe book productions of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nAn anonymous author of a polemical tract, written in the previous\r\ncentury for the purpose of pointing out the errors of some heretical\r\nproduction, says: _Is autem erroneus liber positus fuit publice ad\r\nexemplandum Parisiis anno Domini 1254. Unde certum est quod jam publice\r\npredicaretur nisi boni prelati et predicatores impedirent._ (“This\r\nheretical tract was openly given to the scribes to be copied in Paris\r\nin the year of our Lord, 1254. Whence it is evident what manner of\r\ndoctrine would now be set forth to the public had not good priests\r\nand preachers interfered.”)[93] By the beginning of the 16th century,\r\nthe University of Vienna had taken a leading place among the centres\r\nof education in Europe. It is said to have contained at this time no\r\nless than seven thousand students and the work of the Humanists in\r\nfurthering the revival of interest in the classic authors was in Vienna\r\nat this time particularly active. Within a quarter of a century after\r\nLuther had begun his protests, the Jesuits secured the controlling\r\ninfluence in matters in Vienna and from this time the relative\r\nimportance of the university steadily declined.[94]\r\n\r\nThe jurist Scheurl writes from Nuremberg to Cardinal Campeggi, March\r\n15, 1524: “Every common man is now asking for books or pamphlets and\r\nmore reading is being done in a day than heretofore in a year.”[95]\r\nIn Nuremberg, as in other towns, it became the practice to read the\r\nbooks of Luther out loud in the market place. Erasmus complains, in\r\n1523, that since the publication of the German New Testament, the whole\r\nbook-trade seems to be absorbed with the writings of Luther, and to\r\nbe interested in giving attention to nothing else. He says, further,\r\nthat it is very difficult to find in Germany publishers willing to\r\nplace their imprint upon books written in behalf of the Papacy. As\r\nan example of the kind of interest caused by the writings of Luther,\r\nit is recorded that the magistrates of Bremen sent a bookseller to\r\nWittenberg for the purpose of purchasing for their official use a set\r\nof Luther’s works. The citizens of Speyer are described as having the\r\nbooks read to them at supper, and as making transcripts of the texts.\r\nIn hundreds of towns throughout Germany, Luther’s writings were brought\r\nto the notice of the people by means of the very edict which had for\r\nits purpose their final suppression, and after the Diet of Worms, the\r\ndemand for them rapidly increased. The preacher Matthaeus Zell writes\r\nfrom Strasburg, in 1523: “The Lutheran books are for sale here in the\r\nmarket-place immediately beneath the edicts of the emperor and of the\r\npope declaring them to be prohibited.”\r\n\r\nWith the beginning of the 13th century, it was realised that the newly\r\norganised universities had become the centres of intellectual activity.\r\nThe popes undertook promptly the institution of machinery for the\r\nsupervision of the work done in the universities and of the literary\r\nproductions that came from the instructors. It was the contention of\r\nthe papal representatives that the appointments of the university\r\nofficials having to do directly with the work of multiplying books,\r\nmust rest with the theological faculty, that is to say with the\r\nimmediate representatives of the Church. This contention was, in the\r\nmain, sustained in such university centres as Bologna, Paris, Prague,\r\nVienna, and Cologne. A brief, issued in 1479 by Sixtus IV, charges\r\nthe rectors and the deacons of the university with the responsibility\r\nof censorship. The edict in 1486 by Berthold, Archbishop of Mayence,\r\nis to be classed not as an ecclesiastical act but as an expression\r\nof authority of a German prince. The Archbishop asserted the right\r\non behalf not of the Roman Church but of his State. The censorship\r\nexercised by the University of Cologne terminated with the close of the\r\n15th century. The representative of the Archbishop claimed authority,\r\non the strength of the Bull issued in 1486 by Innocent VIII, directed\r\nagainst the printers of pernicious books, to take into his own hands\r\nthe direction of censorship of the entire principality.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Early Printers and the Church]\r\n\r\n=3. Italy.=--The introduction of the printing-press into Italy was\r\nbrought about under the initiative of Juan Turrecremata, who was Abbot\r\nof Subiaco, and who later became Cardinal. The Cardinal was a Spaniard\r\nby birth and his family name (in the Spanish form Torquemada) was,\r\nlater, associated with some of the most strenuous of the persecutions\r\nwhich the Inquisition brought to bear upon the printers. The great\r\nSpanish inquisitor was a nephew of the Cardinal. The Cardinal had been\r\none of the confessors of Queen Isabella and is said to have made to her\r\nthe first suggestion of the necessity of establishing the Inquisition\r\nin order to check the rising spirit of heresy. He did not realise what\r\na Trojan horse, full of heretical possibilities, he was introducing\r\ninto Italy in bringing in the Germans and their printing-press.\r\n\r\nTurrecremata was a man of scholarly interests, and he felt assured\r\nthat the new art could be made of large service to the Church. He\r\nprovided funds for the establishment in Subiaco, in 1464, of the first\r\nprinting-press in Italy, which was placed in charge of the Germans\r\nSchweinheim and Pannartz who had learned their art directly from\r\nGutenberg. The two Germans later migrated to Rome and within a few\r\nyears there was a large invasion of German printers into the capital.\r\nThe first books printed in Subiaco under the instructions of the\r\nCardinal were a _Donatus_, an edition of Lactantius, and an edition of\r\nthe _De Oratore_ of Cicero. Until towards the close of the century,\r\nwhen the Church authorities began to realise the risks that were to\r\nbe incurred by the Church through the popular distribution of printed\r\nliterature, the German printers found opportunities in Italy for\r\nsuccessful and remunerative business.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Venice]\r\n\r\nIn 1492, the printing art was introduced into Venice, where it speedily\r\ndeveloped into one of the most important of the industries of the\r\ncity. For nearly a century thereafter, Venice took place among the\r\nmost influential of the European centres of publishing and literary\r\nactivity. There were various grounds on which the productions of the\r\nVenetian presses aroused criticism and antagonism in Rome. After the\r\nbeginning of the work of Aldus in 1495, the Venetian publishing lists\r\nincluded a number of productions by Greek scholars. The majority of\r\nthese books being editions of Greek classics, had of course nothing\r\nwhatever to do with matters of doctrine or Church policy. The Roman\r\ncensors of the time had no knowledge of Greek, an ignorance for which\r\nthey were hardly to be criticised, as, until the books of the Aldine\r\npress began to reach the university centres, it was an ignorance that\r\nwas shared by all the scholars of Europe. These ecclesiastics were,\r\nhowever, very apprehensive of the influence of the doctrines of the\r\nGreek Church. They appear to have imagined that the text of Homer\r\nor of Aristotle, or the accompanying notes, might be made to carry\r\nthe contentions of the Greek Church in regard to the old-time issues\r\nwhich had divided Constantinople and Rome. As the censors were unable\r\nthemselves to examine the texts, and were unwilling to accept the\r\nconclusions of any examiners who understood Greek, their only means of\r\ndefence against this insidious attack on the orthodoxy of Italy was to\r\nprohibit the production and the circulation of any volumes printed in\r\nthis heretical language.\r\n\r\nThe presses of Venice were dangerous not only because they were being\r\nutilised by the scholars of Greece, but because they were bringing into\r\nprint also works in Arabic, in Hebrew, in Persian, and in Chaldean. In\r\nthe Index lists as printed in Rome, the term “Chaldean” is utilised to\r\ncover the entire group of Oriental tongues which came into print in\r\none form or another from the presses of Venice. The censors who were\r\nignorant of Greek were not likely to have any knowledge of Hebrew,\r\nwhile there was still less chance that they would be able to secure\r\nan understanding of the character of the literature presented in\r\nother Oriental tongues. The first Hebrew books issued in Venice were\r\neditions of the Hebrew Scriptures, of the _Talmud_ and of the\r\n_Targum_, which were printed under the directions of the rabbins\r\nand at the cost of a publication fund, collected for the purpose from\r\nHebrew congregations throughout South Europe. The doctrines presented\r\nin the long series of Talmudic commentaries might very possibly, if\r\nthey could have been read by the censors in Rome, have been interpreted\r\nas antagonistic, at least by implication, to the authority of the\r\nChurch of Rome. It would have been difficult, however, to point out\r\nany measure of doctrinal antagonism in the Arabic books selected\r\nfor production in Venice. These comprised treatises on mathematics,\r\ntreatises on medicine, and Arabic versions, with commentaries by Arab\r\nphilosophers, of certain of the texts of Aristotle. The two or three\r\nPersian volumes printed in Venice during the first years of the 16th\r\ncentury included an exposition of the faith of Zoroaster, a memoir of\r\nHaroun-al-Raschid, and some specimens of the poets of the 14th century.\r\nThe actual Chaldean volumes, but one or two in all, were devoted to\r\nastrology. It was the repute that came to these volumes that brought\r\nabout the application of the term Chaldean as a description of any\r\nworks of divination or magic. Each of the Roman Indexes, from 1559,\r\ndown, reiterates the prohibition of “Chaldean books of magic.” The\r\ndate of the publication of the first of the Roman Indexes happened to\r\ncoincide with the time of the greatest activity of the publishers of\r\nVenice. If the censorship policy of Rome could be enforced in Venice,\r\nthe Venetian printers would be driven out of business. The issue was\r\none that had to be fought out. The victory finally secured by the\r\nprinters was due, in the main, to the courage and the intellectual\r\nforce of a priest, Paolo Sarpi.\r\n\r\nIn 1479, Pope Sixtus IV makes Jenson, printer-publisher of Venice,\r\nCount Palatine, the first nobleman among publishers. In 1503, the\r\nVenetian Senate charged Musurus (the friend and literary associate\r\nof Aldus and professor of Greek in Padua) with the censorship of all\r\nGreek books printed in Venice, with reference particularly to the\r\nsuppression of anything inimical to the Roman Church. This constitutes\r\none of the earliest attempts made in Italy to supervise the work of\r\nthe printing-press. The action of the Senate was doubtless instigated\r\nby the authorities of the Inquisition. It was natural that the\r\necclesiastics should have dreaded the influence of the introduction\r\ninto Italy of the doctrines of the Greek Church, while it was doubtless\r\nthe case that the refugees from Constantinople brought with them no\r\nvery cordial feeling towards Rome. The belief was very general that\r\nif the Papacy had not felt a greater enmity against the Greek Church\r\nthan against the Turk, the Catholic States of Europe would have saved\r\nConstantinople. The sacking of Constantinople by the armies of the\r\nFourth Crusade was still remembered by the Christians of the East as a\r\ncrime of the Western Church. There were, therefore, reasons enough why\r\nthe authorities of Rome should think it necessary to keep a close watch\r\nover the new literature coming in from the East, and should do what\r\nwas practicable to exclude all doctrinal writings, and the censorship\r\ninstituted in 1503 was but the beginning of a long series of rigorous\r\nenactments.\r\n\r\nThe censorship measures undertaken by the Government of Venice (as\r\nwas true of the measures of other States in which the business of\r\npublishing became of importance) were more largely concerned with\r\nthe supervision of the press for the safety of the State than for\r\nthe interests of the Church. For the century between 1407–1528, this\r\ncensorship in Venice was carried on without the aid of any general\r\nlaw, and was based simply upon a series of precedents evolved from\r\nthe individual action taken by the Government in each instance as it\r\narose. The responsibility for the censorship of the press rested with\r\nthe Council of Ten, which, in its capacity of a standing committee,\r\nassumed a general charge of the morals of the community. An application\r\nfrom a printer for a privilege must, according to the usual routine, be\r\naccompanied by a certificate or _testamur_ from the examiners who\r\nwere willing to certify as to the soundness and the importance of the\r\nwork in question.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1508, we have the first example of an ecclesiastical\r\n_testamur_ being required by the Council of Ten as a condition for\r\ntheir own _imprimatur_. The work was the _Universalis animae\r\ntraditionis liber quintus_ of Gregoriis, and the ecclesiastical\r\ncensor reported that he found in it nothing opposed to Catholic\r\nverity.[96] This is the first instance of a religious censorship\r\nexercised by the secular government. The case indicates the position\r\nthe Government of Venice proposed to take in regard to supervision\r\nof books touching upon theological matters. The State had a personal\r\ninterest in protecting the Church against the attacks of books likely\r\nto be subversive of the Faith, and the authorities were glad to secure\r\nthe opinion of the Church in regard to the character or tendency of a\r\ndoubtful work; it intended, however, to retain in its own hands the\r\nfinal decision as to the permission to print; and it contended that\r\nthe interests of Church and State could be best protected by the State\r\ntaking action for both. It was the conclusion that, while there should\r\nbe a religious censorship, the censor should act only through powers\r\ndelegated to him by the secular government.\r\n\r\nIn 1515, an order was issued by the Council of Ten which established a\r\ngeneral censorship for the literature of the Humanists. It was worded\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n   “In all parts of the world and in the famous cities not only\r\n   of Italy but also of barbarous countries, that the honour of\r\n   the nation may be preserved, it is not allowed to publish works\r\n   until they shall have been examined by the most learned person\r\n   available. But in this our city, so famous and so worthy, no\r\n   attention has as yet been given to this matter; whence it comes\r\n   to pass that the most incorrect editions which appear before\r\n   the world are those issued in Venice, to the dishonour of the\r\n   city. Be it, therefore, charged upon our noble Andrea Navagero\r\n   to examine all works in Humanity which for the future may be\r\n   printed; and without his signature in the volumes they shall\r\n   not be printed, under pain of being confiscated and burned,\r\n   and a fine of three hundred ducats for him who disobeys this\r\n   order.”[97]\r\n\r\nThis is the first Italian example of a general or prevention\r\ncensorship, applied to a whole class of literature. The third class of\r\ncensorship concerns itself with the morals of literature, political\r\nmorality, the attitude of the writer or of the publisher towards the\r\nState, and the probable influence of the book upon decency and _bonos\r\nmores_. The political censorship was apparently more effective than\r\nthe censorship of morals. It was certainly the case that the imprimatur\r\nwas given to not a few books of a scandalous character. In 1526,\r\nthe Council of Ten issued a general order decreeing that for future\r\npublications, the _imprimatur_ should be given only to works which\r\nhad been examined and approved by two censors who should make a sworn\r\nreport that its character was satisfactory.\r\n\r\nIn 1544, the commissioners of the University of Padua were constituted\r\nthe permanent censors of Venetian books submitted for the _imprimatur_\r\nof the council. The censorship of the commissioners covered all points\r\nexcepting those relating to religion or theology, which were still\r\nleft to be passed upon by the ecclesiastical censors. In 1548, the\r\nfirst catalogue of prohibited books was issued in Venice. In this\r\nyear were instituted, as an addition to the regular executive, three\r\ncommissioners on heresy, the _Savii sopra l’Eresia_, who were charged\r\nwith the new publications having to do with matters of religion or\r\ndoctrine and also with the examination of imported books. The Lutheran\r\nheresy was now being promulgated by means of the press, and the\r\necclesiastical authorities were especially suspicious of literature\r\ncoming from Germany. The organisation in this same year, 1548, of the\r\nVenetian guild of printers and publishers had for an important part of\r\nits responsibilities the checking of the production or the importation\r\nof heretical books.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1573, the History of Venice, written by Justiniani, which\r\nhad been examined and, to a considerable extent, corrected by the local\r\ninquisitor, having been brought into print, was required to submit to\r\na further censorship on the part of the Roman examiners. Fra Marco,\r\nthe first examiner, writes to Sirleto that he has already written so\r\nfrequently in regard to this book that he is mortified to trouble him\r\nfurther. He points out, however, that the Venetians are in a state of\r\nirritation that the promised papal permission has not been secured, and\r\nhe asks for a decision in a matter that has already been held up for a\r\nlong period of months.\r\n\r\nIn 1547, occurred the first instance of a trial undertaken in Venice\r\nby the Holy Office for offence committed through the printing-press.\r\nThe list is closed in 1730, with the trial of Giovanni Checcazzi. In\r\nthe 16th century, there were one hundred and thirty-two trials by the\r\nInquisition; in the 17th, fifty-five; in the 18th, but four. It is not\r\nclear whether the diminished activity of the Inquisition during the\r\nlater years was due to the increasingly hostile attitude taken by the\r\nGovernment of Venice towards the Church of Rome after 1596, or to the\r\nfact that the vigour of the press prosecutions during the last half of\r\nthe 16th century had effectively stamped out the publication in Venice\r\nof heretical and immoral publications.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Venice and the Pope]\r\n\r\nIt is in connection with the Index of Pope Clement VIII and the\r\nConcordat that the history of publishing in Venice comes for the first\r\ntime into touch with general history. The claim of the Church to the\r\ncontrol of all publishing undertakings soon became involved in the\r\nlarger question of the relations between Venice and Rome. Paolo Sarpi,\r\nwho became the champion of the cause of the independence of the State\r\nagainst ecclesiastical domination, comes into the history of literature\r\nas the upholder of the rights of authors and of publishers against the\r\ncrushing censorship of the Inquisition. The problem presented to the\r\nVenetian Government was whether the Venetian press, supported in its\r\nliberty by the Government, should continue to maintain its character as\r\none of the freest presses in Europe (and therefore one with the most\r\nactive production); or whether it should be permitted, for want of\r\nthe support of the Government, to fall under the repressive influence\r\nof the Inquisition and the Index. As early as 1491, Franco, Bishop\r\nof Treviso and Papal Legate, had issued a decree prohibiting any one\r\nfrom printing in Venetian territory or from causing or permitting, to\r\nbe printed, any books treating of the Catholic faith or of matters\r\necclesiastical without the express permission of the bishop or of the\r\nvicar-general of the diocese. The Legate named at once two works,\r\nRosselli’s _Monarchia_ and Mirandola’s _Theses_, which were absolutely\r\nprohibited, and all existing copies of which were to be burned in\r\nthe cathedral or in the parish churches within fifteen days from the\r\npublication of the decree. There was no charge that these works were\r\nin any way immoral or scandalous. They were condemned simply on the\r\nground of the unsoundness of their doctrine. The contention raised\r\nin this order on behalf of the Church was far-reaching. If it were\r\nheretical to discuss, in a sense at all hostile to the Curia, the\r\nrelative powers of the pope and the emperor, there would be an implied\r\nright in the Church to censure and to condemn any political writings\r\nin which reference was made to the authority of the pope or to the\r\nresponsibilities of the emperor. It became in fact the keystone of the\r\necclesiastical position that in the case of the Church no separation\r\nwas possible between politics and ecclesiastical dogma. In July, 1693,\r\nParuta, the ambassador of Venice at the Vatican, submitted to the pope\r\na vigorous protest against the publication of the Clementine Index,\r\nwhich was then in readiness. Paruta pointed out that the commercial\r\nimportance of the book-trade in Venice at that time exceeded that of\r\nany city in Europe; that the book-trade was in itself deserving of\r\nprotection and consideration; that a sufficient censorship was already\r\nexercised by the _imprimaturs_ of the Council of Ten, who utilised\r\namong their examiners the inquisitor; that the publication of this\r\nIndex would destroy the property, and might cause the ruin, of many\r\nwho, believing themselves to be safe as long as they kept within the\r\nregulations of the Council of Trent, had published books which were now\r\nto be prohibited in the Clementine Index; that the new Index not only\r\nmade many additions to the lists of prohibited books, but proposed a\r\nradical change in the standard of prohibition--a great number of books\r\nwere now, on the ground of some trivial expressions, to be condemned\r\nalthough they were not at all concerned with ecclesiastical or\r\nreligious questions; that it was important for the Church to keep well\r\naffected men of learning throughout the world and that such men would\r\ncertainly be very much troubled with any measures that interfered with\r\nscholarly undertakings and the distribution of the world’s literature.\r\nThe arguments of Paruta and similar protests that came to Rome from\r\nGermany and from Paris had the effect of convincing the pope that\r\nsome modification of his Index was necessary. The Index, as finally\r\npublished four years later, was very much altered and diminished. Among\r\nthe omissions from the first lists were the titles of the whole class\r\nof non-religious books printed in Venice, in behalf of which Paruta\r\nhad spoken. In 1596, the printers and publishers of Venice again found\r\noccasion to appeal to the Senate for support against the regulations\r\nof the Clementine Index. They found that the works that remained\r\nprohibited in the Clementine lists, in addition to those on previous\r\nlists the prohibitions of which were still in force, included many\r\nthat had constituted an important staple in their trade and that this\r\ntrade, particularly for export, was suffering severely. The Clementine\r\nregulations also undertook to take away from the Venetian printers the\r\nright to print Bibles and missals and to restrict the printing of such\r\nbooks to Rome. Negotiations between the Senate and the Papacy lasted\r\nfor some months but in the end the pope gave way on the more important\r\npoints complained of, and a declaration or Concordat was agreed upon\r\nwhich lessened as far as Venice was concerned the stringency of the\r\nmost objectionable features of the Index. When this Concordat had been\r\nsigned, the Senate authorised the publication of the Index. The most\r\nimportant clause in the Concordat was the seventh, which provided that\r\nthe right of the bishops and inquisitors to prohibit books not on the\r\npresent Index should refer only to books which attacked religion, or\r\nwhich were printed outside of Venice, or which were issued with a\r\nfalse imprint. This limitation of the ecclesiastical Inquisition to\r\npurely religious or theological questions constituted a most valuable\r\nprecedent in the long fight between the Church and the secular\r\nauthorities for the control of the press. The Concordat was the last\r\narrangement arrived at until the year 1766 between Rome and Venice in\r\nregard to the supervision of the press. During the century and a half\r\nfollowing the Concordat, the Venetian republic persistently refused to\r\nauthorise the publication within its territory of an augmented Index.\r\nA list of later prohibitions was, however, finally accepted in 1766,\r\n_juxta formam concordatorum_.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent figure in this long struggle between Venice and\r\nthe Papacy was Fra Paolo Sarpi. Cleric though he was, he contended\r\nvigorously that the Church was embarking upon a wrong course, and he\r\nheld that the State was justified in resisting, in secular matters,\r\necclesiastical encroachments upon the rights of the sovereign. The\r\nfight made by Sarpi on behalf of the independence of the State, and\r\nparticularly of the right of the State to supervise and control\r\nliterary productions, was of first importance for the intellectual\r\nactivities of Europe. The arguments used in Venice were repeated in\r\nMadrid, Paris, Zürich, and Oxford. Time was gained for authors and for\r\nprinters, until, largely by means of the presses which the Church was\r\nendeavouring to throttle, the spirit of resistance to the domination\r\nof the Papacy, and the feeling of national independence against the\r\nright of Rome to lay down the law for Europe, had gathered so much\r\nstrength that the claims of the Church had to be withdrawn or very much\r\nmoderated.\r\n\r\nIn 1613, two books by the Englishman Thomas Preston, who wrote under\r\nthe name of Roger Widdrington, _Apologia Cardinalis Bellarmini_ and\r\n_Disputatio Theologica_, were placed on the Index by the Congregation.\r\nThe Government of Venice, acting under the advice of Sarpi, refused\r\nto allow the provision to take effect in Venice on the two grounds\r\nthat the theological doctrines taught by Widdrington were sound and\r\northodox, and that his arguments against the pernicious doctrine of\r\nthe temporal authority of the pope over princes were eminently worthy\r\nof dissemination.\r\n\r\nThere were also instances of books that were approved by the Church but\r\nthe publication of which was considered detrimental to the interests\r\nof the State, and their sale in Venice was accordingly prohibited. An\r\nexample of this class was the _Recantation_ of the Archbishop\r\nof Spalato, printed in Rome in 1623. The republic objected to the\r\ncontention of the Archbishop that the pope had power in things temporal\r\nas well as in things spiritual. The republic also prohibited the\r\nHistory of the Council of Trent, by Cardinal Pallavicini, written\r\nin answer to the History by Sarpi, on the ground that the work\r\ncontained sentiments obnoxious to the Government of the republic.\r\nIn a report written to the Government by Sarpi, he takes the ground\r\nthat the course of action of the Church during the past few years had\r\nproduced a series of books whose doctrines were entirely subversive\r\nof secular government. The writers taught that no government but the\r\necclesiastical had the divine origin; that secular government is a\r\nthing profane and tyrannical which God permits to be imposed upon his\r\npeople as a kind of trial or persecution; that the people are not\r\nin conscience bound to obey the secular law or to pay taxes; that\r\nthe imposts and subventions are for the most part iniquitous and\r\nunjust, and that the princes who impose these have in many cases been\r\nexcommunicated. In short, princes and rulers are held up to view as\r\nimpious and unjust; subjects may have to obey them perforce, but in\r\nconscience they are free to do all that in them lies to break their\r\nyoke. Sarpi emphasises the importance on the part of the republic in\r\nretaining in their own hands the control of literary censorship.\r\nHe pointed out that unless the burden of papal censorship could be\r\nlessened, literary production in Venice and elsewhere must cease. He\r\ncontended that in the correction of books which are open to censure,\r\nit is not advisable to follow the practice of the Church of “raking\r\nthrough the entrails of an author” and altering the sense and the\r\nintention of a whole sentence so that the writer is made to say the\r\nreverse of what he had desired to say; first, because all the world\r\nstigmatises such action as falsification; secondly, because such\r\nconduct would bring upon Venice the infamous charge of castrating\r\nbooks; thirdly, because the court of Rome assumes for itself the sole\r\nright to alter passages in books. He submitted ten propositions upon\r\nwhich he recommended the Government to take action. The purpose aimed\r\nat in these propositions was the retention in the hands of the State of\r\nthe final decision as to prohibition or expurgation, admitting that the\r\ncivil authorities could very properly utilise in matters of doctrine\r\nthe service of ecclesiastical censors. Sarpi insisted that in all\r\nVenetian editions of the Index, the Concordat should itself be printed.\r\n\r\nIt was evident in the course of the controversy that Venice was,\r\nostensibly at least, as anxious as the Church could be for the purity\r\nof the press. In fact, judging from the Indexes, this point had not\r\ncaused the Church any particular anxiety. The unsettled question was,\r\nwhich authority should exercise the censorship over the offences of\r\nlibel, scandal, and obscenity--the Church or the State? It was the\r\nopinion of Sarpi that all such books should be absolutely prohibited.\r\nThe risk, as emphasised by him, was that the Concordat might fall\r\ninto desuetude, leaving the Venetian press, deprived of the bulwark\r\nwhich the State had secured for its defence, placed completely\r\nunder the control of the Inquisition. The future justified Sarpi’s\r\ndread. The heat of the argument died away, and the Concordat was\r\nsubstantially forgotten. The Inquisition secured full control of\r\nthe censorship. The press of Venice came under the influence of the\r\nIndex and the Rules. Its losses were greater than those of the other\r\npresses that the Council of Trent had undertaken to regulate, for\r\nthe reason that it had so much more to lose. From the middle of the\r\n17th century, the printing-press of Venice, though not destroyed,\r\nceases to hold pre-eminence in Europe. The last contest of Venice\r\nwith Rome occurred in August, 1765, when the Senate issued a decree\r\ninstructing the _Rifformatori_ to publish and to circulate the\r\nIndex of Clement and the Concordat, and providing further that the\r\n_Rifformatori_ should appoint as an equal associate with the\r\ninquisitor an ecclesiastic who should be a subject of Venice, and whose\r\n_testamur_ as to matters of faith and doctrine should have equal\r\nweight with that of the inquisitor.\r\n\r\nA decree was at once issued by the papal court prohibiting the sale\r\nor circulation of all books licensed by the newly appointed Venetian\r\nofficers and the nuncio demanded the withdrawal of the Venetian\r\ndecree. The issue between the republic and the Papacy turned simply\r\nupon the selection of the authority that should decide what was\r\nheretical or dangerous. The republic was prepared to make use of\r\necclesiastical censors but insisted that these must be appointed by\r\nthe civil government. The Papacy, on the other hand, maintained that\r\nthe entire responsibility of keeping the faithful from poisonous\r\nfood had been entrusted to the Church. The Venetian decree of 1765\r\nwas never withdrawn and the place of inquisitor as censor of books\r\nupon matters of faith was thereafter held by persons appointed by the\r\n_Rifformatori_ of the university. As late as 1794, the commissioners\r\nof heresy secured an opinion from these university censors upon the\r\n_Institutiones Theologicae_ of De Montazet, Archbishop of Lyons, which\r\nhad been condemned at Rome in 1792. As a result of their report, the\r\nGovernment refused to sanction the decree of the Congregation of the\r\nIndex. Such an instance can be accepted as an evidence that the press\r\nof Venice had at last secured freedom from the censorship of Rome.\r\nThe revolutionary spirit which was agitating all Europe, and which in\r\nFrance had for the time completely overthrown both Church and monarchy,\r\nmust have seriously weakened the control of the Papacy over the Italian\r\nStates, and doubtless exercised no little influence in this final\r\ncontest between the ecclesiastical censorship and the printing-press.\r\nThe Venetian press possessed a greater measure of freedom than had been\r\nsecured by the printer-publishers of any other Italian State and this\r\nwas an important factor in its long-continued pre-eminence. The general\r\ncourse, however, of the legislation for the supervision of the press\r\nwas similar in character to that of the other Italian cities in which\r\nattention was given to printing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rome]\r\n\r\nThe city which undertook the task of at once purifying and revitalising\r\nthe literature of the Christian world, has itself been curiously barren\r\nof literary producers. In examining the lists of the writers of Italy\r\nwhose names and whose works have survived through the centuries, one is\r\nsurprised to note how few are to be credited to Rome. It is Florence,\r\nVenice, Bologna, Ferrara, Milan, and Naples that are recorded as the\r\nbirthplaces of the most illustrious of the writers of Italy, and it was\r\nalso largely in these smaller cities rather than in the capital that\r\ntheir important work was carried on.\r\n\r\nIn artistic productions, the record of Rome is more important. There\r\nwas, during the 16th and 17th centuries, a Roman school of art that\r\nhad influence, while in Rome were produced many of the famous works by\r\nartists who were natives of Tuscany, of Venice, or of other regions\r\noutside of the States of the Church.\r\n\r\nThe vision of the cardinal’s hat or of the tiara must have had a\r\npowerful effect in attracting to the papal capital the talent of\r\nthe Christian world, and particularly, of course, of Italy; but the\r\nconcentration of energies upon ecclesiastical aims and dignities may\r\neasily have had a depressing and restricting influence on general\r\nintellectual development, at least as expressed in literature or art.\r\n\r\nDejob suggests that the possession of the throne of St. Peter, held as\r\nthe chief wealth of the country, may possibly have brought intellectual\r\npoverty to Italy as the mines of America had caused ruin to Spain.\r\n\r\nIt is the conclusion of Dejob that the crushing surveillance of\r\necclesiasticism, in connection with the demoralising influences that\r\nopulence had brought upon a society already corrupt, has been the chief\r\nreason why the States of the Church produced fewer writers and artists\r\nof note than are to be credited to the other Italian States; while the\r\nRoman writers whose names are known, such as Leopardi and Caporali,\r\nhave in their work manifested an aversion rather than a patriotic\r\nsympathy for the spirit of their home government.[98]\r\n\r\nAn examination of the list of the popes shows how seldom the choice has\r\nfallen on any one not a native of Italy. Since Adrian VI, who died in\r\n1523, no “foreigner” has been called to the headship of the “World’s\r\nChurch,” while of the forty-one popes who have ruled the Church since\r\nAdrian, no less than twenty were born within the territory of the\r\nStates of the Church. Dejob (writing in the time of Pius IX) is willing\r\nto ascribe greatness to but one pope since the 16th century, namely\r\nSixtus V.[99]\r\n\r\nThis impresses me as too sweepingly pessimistic, at least if we are\r\nto consider the term greatness by the standard attained by the other\r\nmonarchs of Europe. I should suppose for instance that Benedict XIV\r\nwas entitled to a high relative position among the rulers of the 18th\r\ncentury for wisdom and for capacity.\r\n\r\nIn 1561, Pius IV calls to Rome Paul Manutius, son of Aldus, to take\r\ncharge of the publication of the writings of the Fathers of the Church\r\nand of such other works as might be selected. Pius was impressed with\r\nthe belief that the printing-press, under scholarly management, could\r\nbe made of service to the cause of the Church in withstanding the\r\npernicious influence of the increasing mass of the publications of the\r\nGerman heretics. These Protestant pamphlets and books were not merely\r\nundermining the authority of the Church in Germany, in Switzerland,\r\nand in France, but were making their way into Italy itself. The first\r\nissues of the Aldine press in Rome were the decrees of the Council of\r\nTrent, the writings of Cyprian, and the letters of St. Jerome. The\r\npress secured the continued support of Pius V and of Gregory XII.\r\n\r\nPius V, when he was Inquisitor of Como, had made one seizure of twelve\r\nbales of books characterised by him as heretical, which had been sent\r\nfrom the Valtelina to Como for distribution in Lombardy and Romagna.\r\nThe books were detained at the office of the Inquisition, but the\r\napplication for their release on the part of the bookseller to whom\r\nthey were consigned, being backed up by the vicar and the chapter, the\r\ntoo zealous inquisitor was compelled to release the books, and escaped\r\nonly with difficulty payment of damages to the importer whose business\r\nhad been interfered with.[100] The same inquisitor, when stationed at\r\nBergamo, made seizure of two chests of prohibited books, which were in\r\nthe possession of a priest who was waiting for a favourable opportunity\r\nfor their distribution. The inquisitor reports that the priest had\r\nbecome depraved by the reading of heretical literature.[101]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Milan]\r\n\r\nIn 1614, the Milan guild of printers and booksellers secured a fresh\r\nedict confirming its authority and enjoined, under heavy penalties,\r\nstrict obedience to its regulations. In the application for this\r\ndecree, the guild no longer lays stress upon the necessity of\r\nupholding the dignity and honourable standard of the book-trade, but\r\nemphasises the risk to the Church and to the community of believers\r\nif permission to print or to sell books should be given to uneducated\r\nand irresponsible persons who could not be familiar with the lists of\r\nforbidden works. Experience had evidently made clear to the publishers\r\nthat with a government like that of Spain (which might be described as\r\na despotism tempered by the Inquisition) this class of considerations\r\nwould be more influential than any thought of upholding the dignity\r\nof the business of making and selling books. The confirmation of\r\nthe authority of the guild under the direct control of ecclesiastics\r\nrepresenting the Spanish Inquisition, had the effect of checking its\r\nbusiness in publications outside of the classes of jurisprudence and\r\nmedicine. These subjects were naturally less affected by ecclesiastical\r\ncensorship.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Discrimination in Censorship]\r\n\r\nA factor to be taken into account in considering the selections of\r\nbooks ordered to be condemned, was the patriotism of the Italian\r\nclergy, in whose hands rested the control of the operations of the\r\nCongregation. They were as unwilling to characterise as pernicious\r\nnoteworthy and representative books by Italian writers, as they\r\nwere to place any one but an Italian on the throne of St. Peter.\r\nThis partisan zeal for the literary glory of Italy must frequently\r\nhave seriously interfered with the aim of securing a consistent and\r\neffective Index and have brought upon a conscientious pope not a little\r\nembarrassment. An example of the difficulty experienced by Rome in\r\nenforcing a consistent censorship in the face of Italian patriotism,\r\non the part of ecclesiastics, no less than of laymen, is afforded by\r\nDante and Petrarch. Of the former, was prohibited the _De Monarchia_,\r\nbut the _Divine Comedy_, with all its bitter strictures of things\r\necclesiastical, escaped condemnation and even expurgation.\r\n\r\nThe _Canzoniere_ of Petrarch were also left untouched by Rome, although\r\nthe Inquisition of Spain had characterised them most severely in the\r\nIndexes of 1612 and 1667. It was not until 1667 that the _Satires_ of\r\nAriosto were placed upon the Index, while the _Comedies_ of the same\r\npoet were never condemned although in these the poet had assailed\r\nfiercely the trade in indulgences, and had painted a vivid picture of\r\nthe traffic carried on by the capital of the Christian world with the\r\nblood of the apostles and martyrs.\r\n\r\nThe example of independence set by Venice in its series of contests\r\nwith the Church for the freedom of the press had a natural influence in\r\nother cities of Italy where conditions were favourable for publishing\r\nactivity. In Florence, Pisa, Ferrara, Milan, and other cities in\r\nwhich scholarship had flourished during the manuscript period,\r\nthe productions of the printing-press became, during the 15th and\r\n16th centuries, of increasing importance. This work was frequently\r\ninterfered with and sometimes seriously hampered by the censorship\r\nregulations of Rome and by the operations of the local inquisitors,\r\nbut it was never entirely blocked even in any one city. The feeling of\r\nState and municipal independence and the individuality of the people\r\nwere too strong to be crushed out by Roman edicts or by the threats\r\nof the Inquisition. In Italy as in Germany, the fact that there was\r\nnot one government in the peninsula, but a number of independent\r\nStates, helped to secure for the work of the printers some degree of\r\nopportunity, notwithstanding the censorship edicts of the Church and\r\nthe repressive measures of the State. The presses of the day were small\r\nand in case of trouble in one city, they could easily be moved to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nAn instance of a book the censorship of which caused no little\r\ndifficulty to the authorities of the Index is afforded by the\r\n_Decameron_ of Boccaccio. The book had, under the instructions of\r\nPaul IV, been placed upon the Index of 1559, and the prohibition was\r\nconfirmed in that of 1564. In response to an urgent requirement from\r\nthe public, an expurgated edition was printed for the needs of the\r\nfaithful by the Giunti in Florence in 1573, under a special privilege\r\nfrom the Duke of Tuscany and from Gregory XIII, who himself contributed\r\na prefatory word. The volume includes further an authorisation from\r\nManrique, Grand Inquisitor, and one from de Pise, Inquisitor-General\r\nof Florence. The introduction states that the work has been purged of\r\nits obnoxious passages. It appears, however, that the eliminations were\r\nconfined almost exclusively to the passages which were tainted with\r\nheresy, and to the uncomplimentary references to the clergy and to\r\nmonastic institutions. The amorous incidents are left untouched, but\r\nin all cases in which a monk or a cleric, an abbess or a nun is made\r\nby Boccaccio to play an undignified or unworthy rôle, the character is\r\nreplaced by a citizen, a nobleman, or a bourgeoise.\r\n\r\nThe edition of the _Decameron_, revised under the instructions\r\nof Gregory XIII, did not prove satisfactory to Sixtus V, and the\r\nbook was therefore replaced on the Index. The demand for copies on\r\nthe part of readers, ecclesiastics and others, who were prepared to\r\nrespect the prohibition of the Index, continued urgent, and the Pope\r\nauthorised the production of a further expurgated edition, which was\r\nprinted in Florence in 1582 and reprinted in Venice in 1588. The task\r\nof expurgation had been confided to two laymen, Salviati, known as a\r\nlinguist, and Groto, a poet. This further revision still failed to\r\nsatisfy the Pope and the book remained on the Index, but it continued\r\nin general reading, and the authorities appear finally to have decided\r\nto close their eyes to this particular instance of disobedience.\r\nThe record presents a curious example of a book the vitality of\r\nwhich, persisting through the centuries, defied all efforts for its\r\nsuppression. It is referred to by the historians as the first _chef\r\nd’oeuvre_ in prose that had as yet been produced in Italy, whose\r\nliterature was so rich in great poems.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Papal Authorisation]\r\n\r\nOne would suppose that the authority of the head of the Church ought\r\nto have been accepted in all cases as adequate to cover the permission\r\nrequired for the printing and continued circulation of a book. It\r\nappears, however, that from time to time even the papal authorisations\r\nwere disregarded or failed to receive continued consideration. Dejob\r\nrefers to a history of Bologna by Sigone, the publication of which was\r\nsuspended, owing to the malignancy of certain Bolognese, after the\r\napproval had been secured from the examiners appointed by the pope.\r\nBaronius, the defender of the most extreme claims for the supremacy of\r\nthe Papacy, secured for his monograph on Sixtus V the approbation of\r\nthe papal examiner and of the master of the palace. Notwithstanding\r\nthis approval, the printing of the book was blocked through some cabal\r\nand the work was held up until Cardinal Caraffa intervened to secure\r\nits publication.[102]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1600, was completed, in thirteen folio volumes, the\r\n_Annales Ecclesiastici_ of Baronius, the most comprehensive work\r\nwhich the controversies of the Protestant revolt had as yet produced.\r\nThe series was continued by various writers until, in the edition\r\nissued at Lucca in 1738–1786, it had grown to thirty-eight folio\r\nvolumes, a work of which purchase was difficult and perusal impossible.\r\n\r\nA reply to Baronius was undertaken by Casaubon, who published in\r\nLondon in 1604 (as a fragment of the work originally planned) his\r\n_Exercitationes_, a volume of eight hundred folio pages. For\r\nthe great work of Baronius, the authorities of the Church interested\r\nthemselves in securing through the Church machinery channels of\r\ndistribution and such reading public as was practicable considering its\r\ncompass and scholastic character.\r\n\r\nThe Roman idea of reforming and developing the intellectual life\r\nof the State was to follow a policy of official supervision with\r\nprohibitions and penalties. Ecclesiastical censors undertook to bring\r\nauthors under a system of religious and theological obligations, and\r\nwere willing to give their official approval only to works complying\r\nwith their standards. Certain writers accept with docility the\r\nregulations imposed, but it is not those whose productions will live\r\nor will retain influence. The books that have not conformed to the\r\necclesiastical restrictions must be either reshaped or suppressed.\r\nIt is not under such conditions, says Dejob, that a great literature\r\ncan be produced.[103] And yet in spite of an ecclesiastical policy of\r\nrestriction and repression enforced, or at least attempted, through\r\ncenturies, the intellectual vitality of Italy was so great that it\r\nproved impossible to crush out its independence of thought, or even\r\nseriously to limit the expression of its spiritual and literary ideals.\r\nA scholarly Catholic of France writing in 1883 says (in substance):\r\n\r\nThe peculiar conception, that from the earliest times Italy had formed,\r\nof the Kingdom of God and of the way in which this Kingdom was to be\r\nreached, the astounding freedom of spirit with which (during the middle\r\nages) it handled matters of dogma and of discipline, the serenity that\r\nit was able to maintain in the face of the great mystery of life and\r\ndeath, the marvellous way with which it brought into accord faith and\r\nrationalism, its indifference for heresies and for the temerities of\r\nits mystical imagination, the ardent affection with which it accepted\r\nthe highest ideals of Christianity, and finally, the indignation with\r\nwhich from time to time it denounced the feebleness, the violence,\r\nthe corruption of the Church of Rome,--this is the religion of Italy,\r\nthe faith of Peter Damien, of Arnold of Brescia, of St. Francis,\r\nof John of Parma, of St. Catherine of Siena, of Savonarola, and of\r\nOchino; but it was also the faith of Dante and of Petrarch, of Giotto,\r\nof Fra Angelico, and of Raphael, of Vittoria Colonna and of Michael\r\nAngelo.[104]\r\n\r\n\r\n=4. Spain.=--In Spain as in Italy, the Church did not at once\r\nrealise the risks to orthodoxy that were to be associated with the\r\nwork of the printers. German printers coming to Spain as early as\r\n1474 were received with favour and found opportunities for profitable\r\nwork. Even Hebrew printers were at the outset welcomed. Between the\r\nyears 1499–1510, Cardinal Ximenes (following in the footsteps of\r\nTurrecremata) paid fifty thousand crowns for the production of a series\r\nof classics. It was not until 1510 that the Church began, through the\r\norganisation of its censorship, to hamper the work of the printers.\r\nPütter is authority for the statement[105] that for a term of two years\r\n(1484–1486) Christopher Columbus served as a bookseller’s apprentice\r\nand as a colporteur. An ecclesiastic named Bernaldes writes in 1487: “I\r\nhave recently seen a man named Christofero Colombo who comes from Genoa\r\nand who is a dealer in printed books that he has brought to this city\r\n(Cogolludo) from Andalusia.”\r\n\r\nThe destruction of books classed as pernicious appears to have been,\r\nduring the 15th century, within the province of any person of position\r\nand influence.[106] In 1490, Torquemada burned, under order of\r\nFerdinand and Isabella, a number of Hebrew Bibles, and, later, he made\r\nat Salamanca an _auto-da-fé_ of more than six thousand volumes\r\ndescribed as books of magic or as infected with Jewish errors. Ximenes,\r\nwhile yet merely Archbishop, burned in the public square of Granada\r\nno less than five thousand Arabic books, many of them splendidly\r\nornamented and illuminated. The only books spared from the collection\r\nwere those on the subject of medicine, which were deposited in the\r\nUniversity of Alcala.[107] In 1502, Ferdinand and Isabella enacted\r\nan elaborate law, which is referred to as the first of the kind in\r\nEurope, establishing a general censorship of the press. In this law,\r\nwere laid down the principles on which were based nearly all subsequent\r\nenactments. To Spain thus belongs the honour of organising the system\r\nwhich was to exercise an influence so incomputable on the development\r\nof human intelligence.\r\n\r\n“The Spanish people strove earnestly for the maintenance of the faith\r\nbut it understood by this not the reform of methods of life and the\r\ncorrection of immorality, but the extirpation of heresy.”[108]\r\n\r\n“The uncompromising character of the Spanish temperament, which pursued\r\nits object regardless of consequences, saw at once what was elsewhere\r\nonly perceived by degrees, that any endeavours to set bounds to the\r\nmultiplying products of the press could be successful only under a\r\nthorough system of minute surveillance.”[109] It was ordered that\r\nno book should be printed or imported or exposed for sale without\r\nexamination and license. In some places, this duty was imposed upon\r\njudges of the royal courts and in others on the archbishops or bishops.\r\nThe examiners, men of good repute and learning, were to be appointed\r\nby these authorities and were to be adequately paid for their work.\r\nAfter a work in manuscript had been licensed for printing, the printed\r\nsheets were to be carefully compared with the original to insure that\r\nno alteration had been made on the press. Any book printed or imported\r\nor offered for sale without such license was to be seized and burned\r\nand the printer or vendor was declared incapable of longer carrying on\r\nthe business.[110] In this first enactment, no reference is made to\r\nthe Inquisition as having any concern either with the investigation\r\nof books for heresies or with the punishment of delinquents; but\r\nthe Inquisition had not long to wait before its jurisdiction over\r\nliterature was established on an impregnable basis.\r\n\r\nAfter the beginning of the Reformation in Germany, the operations of\r\nthe censorship in Spain were carried on with renewed vigour. Special\r\nefforts were naturally made to protect the faithful in Spain from\r\ncontamination through the importation of heretical books from Germany.\r\nA letter of June 25, 1524, written by Martin de Salinas, mentions\r\nthat a ship from Holland bound for Valencia had been captured by\r\nthe French and then recaptured and brought into San Sebastian. In\r\ndischarging the vessel, there were found two casks of Lutheran books\r\nwhich were publicly burned. Salinas writes, some months later, that\r\nthree Venetian galleasses had arrived at a port in Granada, bringing\r\nlarge quantities of Lutheran books. The books were burned and the\r\ncaptains and crews arrested. An edict of the Supreme Council of the\r\nInquisition, issued in August, 1530, urged the inquisitors to increased\r\nvigilance in connection particularly with the destruction of certain\r\nLutheran writings that had been introduced under false titles or under\r\nthe names of Catholic authors. The inquisitors were ordered to add to\r\nthe Edict of Denunciations, published annually, a clause requiring the\r\ndenunciation of all who possessed such books or of all who had read\r\nthem.[111] In spite of the watchfulness of the inquisitors and of the\r\ncustoms officials, it is reported that, in 1570, no less than thirty\r\nthousand copies of a Spanish version of the _Institutes_ of Calvin\r\nwere brought over the frontier.[112]\r\n\r\nIt is the conclusion of Ticknor that by the end of the 16th century,\r\nbookselling in Spain, in the sense in which the term was used elsewhere\r\nin the world, was practically unknown, and the Inquisition and the\r\nconfessional had often made most rare what was most desirable. In\r\nMarch, 1521, papal briefs were sent to Spain, warning the Spanish\r\nGovernment to prevent the further introduction of books written by\r\nLuther and his followers, copies of which had, it was believed, been\r\npenetrating into the country for about a year. These papal briefs\r\nwere addressed to the civil administration, which still, in form at\r\nleast, retained in its own hands the control of such matters. It was,\r\nhowever, more natural and more in accordance with the ideas then\r\nprevalent, not only in Spain but in other countries, to look to the\r\necclesiastical power for remedies in a matter connected with religion.\r\nThis was certainly the attitude of the great body of the Spanish\r\npeople. In less than a month (as is evident from the date of the briefs\r\nin question) and possibly even before these briefs were received in\r\nSpain, the grand inquisitor addressed an order to the tribunals under\r\nhis jurisdiction, requiring them to search for, and to seize, all books\r\nsupposed to contain the doctrines of the new heresy. The measure was\r\nbold and proved successful.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Supreme Council of the Inquisition proceeded with\r\nthis work with a firm and consistent step. By successive decrees issued\r\nbetween 1521 and 1553, it was ordained that all persons who had in\r\ntheir possession books infected with the doctrines of Luther, and all\r\npersons also who failed to denounce the holders of such books, should\r\nbe excommunicated and subject to severe punishments. These decrees\r\ngave to the Inquisition the right to inquire into the contents and the\r\ncharacter of whatever books were sold and printed. They also relegated\r\nto itself the power to determine what books might be sent to the\r\npress. This assumption was made gradually and with little noise, but\r\neffectually.\r\n\r\nWhile at first there was no direct authority for such action from\r\neither the pope or the Kingdom of Spain, it necessarily implied the\r\nassent of both, and was carried into effect by means furnished by one\r\nor the other. In certain works printed before 1550, the Inquisition\r\nbegan quietly and without any formal authority to take cognisance and\r\ncontrol of books that were about to be printed. A curious treatise\r\non exchange, by de Villalon, entitled _Tratado de Cambios_, was\r\nprinted at Valladolid in 1541. The title-page declared that the book\r\nhad been “_Visto por los señores Inquisidores_.” In the _Silva\r\nde Varia Leccion_, of Pero, printed at Seville, in 1543, the title\r\ngives the imperial license for printing, while the colophon adds that\r\nof the Apostolical inquisitor. The author was evidently anxious to\r\nsecure, in addition to a permission resting on law, one which rested on\r\nthe still more formidable authority of the Church.\r\n\r\nA system which should effectually preserve the faithful from the\r\ncontamination of evil by keeping from them the knowledge of its\r\nexistence comprised two functions; the first was the examination of all\r\nbooks prior to publication, permitting only the innocent to be printed;\r\nthe second was the scrutiny of the books that had come from the press\r\nand the condemnation or expurgation of those containing errors which\r\nhad escaped the vigilance of the first examiners. Under the rigid\r\ninstitution of censorship in Spain, the first of these duties was\r\nassumed by the State and the second was confided to the Inquisition.\r\nThe first law in regard to Spanish censorship was enacted in 1502 and\r\nforbade the printing or importation of any book without an examination\r\nand license. The chancellor Gattinara, writing in 1527 to Erasmus,\r\nsays that in Spain no book could see the light without a careful\r\npreliminary inspection which was rigidly enforced. This statement is\r\nconfirmed in 1540 by Hugo de Celso. The Inquisition had no legal status\r\nin the matter of preliminary licensing, but its growing influence\r\ncaused its judgment to be frequently appealed to in advance. Ticknor\r\nmakes reference to books of 1536, 1541, and 1546 as bearing records of\r\nexamination by the Inquisition.\r\n\r\nIn 1554, an edict of Charles V confines to the royal council the\r\nfunction of issuing licenses for the printing of books of all\r\ndescriptions. In the case of works of importance, the original\r\nmanuscript was to be deposited with the council to ensure detection\r\nof any alterations made while the book was going through the press.\r\nIn 1558, it is ordered under royal edict that no bookseller or other\r\nperson shall sell or possess any books printed or to be printed which\r\nhave been condemned by the Inquisition and that such books should be\r\npublicly burned. The penalty is death and confiscation of all property.\r\nThe same penalties apply to the importing of any books in Romance which\r\ndo not bear a printed license from the council. A later regulation\r\nspecifies that, in order to prevent any alterations in the printing,\r\nthe original manuscript shall be signed on every leaf by a secretary\r\nof the royal chamber, who shall mark and rubricate every correction or\r\nalteration in it and shall state at the end the number of leaves and\r\nof alterations. When the printing has been completed, these corrected\r\nleaves are to be compared with the printed sheets. The infection of\r\nheresy could be communicated by manuscript, and therefore the penalty\r\nof death and confiscation is decreed for all who own or show to others\r\nmanuscripts on any religious subject without first submitting these to\r\nthe council.[113] Lea goes on to say: “I am not aware that any human\r\nbeing was actually put to death for violating its provisions, unless\r\nthe offence was complicated with heresy express or implied, but such\r\nviolation remained to the end a capital crime. The only modification\r\nof this ferocious penalty occurs in a revision of the press law in\r\n1752.”[114] It is not surprising that under restrictions of this\r\ncharacter, the work of the Spanish printer-publishers during the 16th\r\ncentury was seriously hampered. As an example of the enforcement of\r\nthe regulations of the Valdes Index of 1559, may be named the case of\r\na French priest named Jean Fesque. He had handed to a bookseller named\r\nTrechel a volume without imprint, asking Trechel if he could say where\r\nit was printed. The book belonged to the condemned list, being a French\r\nversion of the Psalms of David, translated by Marot and Bèza. Fesque\r\nstated that he had purchased the book from a boy in the street without\r\nknowledge of its character. He was brought before the Inquisition, and\r\nafter five months’ imprisonment and various examinations, he was put to\r\nthe torture but was unable to give further evidence as to the history\r\nof the book. He was finally released after six months’ incarceration,\r\nseriously disabled by the torture.[115]\r\n\r\nThe machinery of the Inquisition was effective even in the farther\r\nparts of the empire. In 1795, a priest in the settlement of Hopelcheen\r\nin Yucatan published a prohibition of the Inquisition warning his\r\ncongregation not to read a certain book which had been described by\r\nthe Inquisition as dangerous and to surrender at once all copies in\r\ntheir possession. The book was entitled _Disengaño del Hombre_, by\r\nPuglia, and bore the imprint (possibly fictitious) of Philadelphia. The\r\ncongregation of Indians and half-breeds was hardly likely to have had\r\nknowledge of the book or to have been able to read it even if copies\r\nhad reached Hopelcheen.[116]\r\n\r\n_The Index expurgatorius_ in its literal sense may be described\r\nas peculiarly a Spanish institution. In the Roman series, there is\r\nrecord of the publication of but one expurgatory Index, that of\r\nBrasichelli, and this was never republished and was in fact promptly\r\nrecalled by the authorities. The inquisitors of Spain took upon\r\nthemselves the task of preserving the faithful from contamination, and\r\nthe successive expurgatory Indexes give evidence of the enormous labour\r\nexpended by the examiners in the correction of the text of books which\r\nthey were not prepared absolutely to prohibit, but the circulation of\r\nwhich they were ready to permit if the heresies could be expunged or\r\ncorrected. The Roman prohibitory Index contained against many works\r\nthe restriction _donec corrigatur_. This indicated that the book\r\nwhen corrected was to be permitted; the objectionable passages were,\r\nhowever, not specified, although the author could ascertain these on\r\napplication. As an actual result, it was very rarely the case that it\r\nproved practicable to bring into publication an edition in which the\r\ncorrections in question, having been ascertained from the authorities,\r\ncould be made. The Spanish censors took credit to themselves for their\r\nliberality in securing the use of heretical works of value through the\r\nexpurgation of the offensive passages. It is true that, under this\r\nsystem, permission was given for the production of the writings of\r\nauthors like Erasmus, Casaubon, Bertram, and others who were absolutely\r\nprohibited in Rome. It does not appear, however, that as far as the\r\npublishers of Spain were concerned, this permission brought about\r\nfor the greater portion of the books in question the production of\r\ncorrected editions. It is in fact easy to understand how the heavy\r\nloss that must be incurred through the suppression of the original\r\nedition would have discouraged both author and printer from the task\r\nof risking a further investment in a second edition which might itself\r\nin like manner be prohibited until again revised. It may safely be\r\nconcluded that the restricted prohibition in Spain had as far as the\r\nproduction and distribution of books were concerned practically the\r\nsame result as the absolute prohibition in Rome. In fact, in Spain,\r\nthe result was more effective simply because the regulations of the\r\nSpanish Inquisition were enforced, while for the similar orders of\r\nthe Inquisition of Rome or of the Congregation of the Index, the\r\nenforcement throughout the States of Italy or outside of Italy was but\r\nvacillating and fragmentary. An example of the watchfulness of the\r\nSpanish examiners is given in the expurgation of a passage from the\r\nSecond Part of _Don Quixote_. But a single sentence is cancelled.\r\nIt reads: “Works of charity negligently performed are of no worth.”\r\nIn the _Divine Comedy_ of Dante, the censors found but three\r\npassages for excision. Lea points out that for this work at least the\r\nexamination can hardly be described as thorough.[117] In 1790, the\r\nhistory of the monastery of Sixena, by Varon, which had been published\r\nwith the approval of the royal examiners in 1776, was prohibited until\r\nthe following sentence had been expurgated: “When Philip the Second\r\nwas despoiling the world to enrich his monastery of the Escorial.”\r\nThe Inquisition of Spain even assumed for itself the authority to\r\nrevise and correct the utterances of the popes. The State utilised the\r\ncensorship of the Inquisition not only for matters theological but for\r\nthe suppression of writings that were purely political. Instructions\r\nof Clement VIII were accepted as the authority for the expurgation\r\nof teachings that were derogatory to princes and to ecclesiastics and\r\ncontrary to good morals. In 1612, for instance, the works of Antonio\r\nPerez were placed on the Index because they were critical of Philip\r\nII.[118] In 1640, the Inquisition suppressed a manifesto addressed by\r\nthe authorities of Barcelona to Philip IV, and, in 1642, it prohibited\r\na further manifesto in which the Catalans accused the favourite,\r\nOlivares, of causing the misfortunes of Spain. In 1643, on the other\r\nhand, after the dismissal of Olivares, the Inquisition prohibited a\r\npamphlet which had been issued in his defence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Book-trade and the Inquisition]\r\n\r\nUnder an edict of 1602, commissioners of the Inquisition were\r\nstationed at all the ports with instructions to seize all books by\r\nnew authors and all new and enlarged editions of new books as they\r\narrived and to allow no one to handle these until they had been\r\ninspected by representatives of the supreme council. Prohibited\r\nbooks were detained and burned. The regulations of the Inquisition\r\nhad at this time rendered very difficult the carrying on of the\r\nprinting and publishing business in Spain, with the result of very\r\nmuch decreasing the annual production of books. The requirements\r\nof scholars and readers could therefore be met only through the\r\nimportation of books produced in France, Italy, or the Netherlands.\r\nThe necessity, however, of securing for imported books, in addition\r\nto the inspection (onerous enough in itself) on the part of customs\r\nofficials, an examination, volume by volume, by the representatives\r\nof the Inquisition, brought such serious burdens, expenses, and risks\r\nupon the business of the importers as to render this unprofitable.\r\nIt is certainly the case that the circulation of books in Spain\r\nduring the 17th century became very inconsiderable. An order issued\r\nin 1597 gives evidence of some consideration for the property of\r\nforeigners. When heretics came to trade, bringing books for their own\r\nuse, the commissioner was instructed to examine these and to mark\r\nconspicuously and indelibly such as belonged to the prohibited list,\r\nso that they could be recognised by the faithful. The owners were\r\nwarned, under heavy penalties, not to bring such books to the shore.\r\nIn 1631, it was directed that “ships of England should be treated with\r\ngentleness so as not to cause offence.”[119] The instructions for the\r\nexamination of vessels, whether Spanish or foreign, to guard against\r\nthe introduction not only of prohibited books but of heretics, and to\r\npunish any infractions of the faith that might during the voyage have\r\nbeen committed either by the crew or passengers, were very precise and\r\nexacting.\r\n\r\nUnder the fourth article of these instructions, a report is to be given\r\nas to what Christian doctrine and prayers of the Church have been\r\nrecited at sea and what saints have been advocated and invoked in their\r\nnecessities and perils. Under article six, it is ordered that all boxes\r\nand chests of the sailors and passengers were to be opened for evidence\r\nof heresy.\r\n\r\nHenry C. Lea, in a letter to the writer (under date of October 31,\r\n1898) in regard to the effect of censorship on the literary interests\r\nof Spain, says:\r\n\r\n   “I was chiefly interested in tracing the influence of censorship\r\n   on the intellectual and political development of Spain, but in\r\n   many instances a side light is thrown upon the resultant injury\r\n   to the commercial interests involved,--as for instance the ruin\r\n   of Portonares, the greatest Spanish printer, as a result of the\r\n   censorship (_i. e._ the condemnation of the Vatable Bible.)\r\n   The business of bookselling was in fact crippled in every way.\r\n   I have met with one case in which a bookseller humbly petitions\r\n   the Inquisition to come to a decision in regard to certain books\r\n   which he had imported and which had been in the hands of the\r\n   _Calificadores_ (examiners) for four years.\r\n\r\n   “The _prima facies_ was against all books; their innocence\r\n   had to be proved before their circulation could be allowed\r\n   and even after this they were still liable at any time to an\r\n   adverse judgment. Under these circumstances, commerce in books\r\n   was necessarily crippled and the diffusion of intelligence was\r\n   reduced to a minimum.”\r\n\r\nThe books that were published during the 16th century, and indeed for\r\na century later, bore everywhere marks of the subjection to which the\r\npress and those who wrote for the press were alike reduced. From the\r\nabject title-pages and dedications of the authors themselves through\r\nthe series of certificates collected from their friends to establish\r\nthe orthodoxy of works that were often as little connected with\r\nreligion as fairy tales, down to the colophon supplicating pardon for\r\nany unconscious neglect of the authority of the Church or for any too\r\nfree use of classical mythology, we are continually impressed with\r\npainful proofs, not only how completely the human mind was enslaved in\r\nSpain, but how grievously it had become cramped and crippled by what\r\nit had so long borne.[120] Of the few dramatic pieces written in the\r\nearlier part of the reign of Charles V, nearly all except those on\r\nstrictly religious subjects were laid under the ban of the Church;\r\nseveral in fact being now known to have existed only because their\r\nnames appear in the _Index expurgatorius_; and others, like the\r\n_Amadis de Gaula_ of Gil Vicente, though printed and published,\r\nbeing subsequently forbidden to be represented.[121]\r\n\r\nTicknor writes (with reference to the trial of Luis de Leon, in\r\nDecember, 1576):\r\n\r\n   “The very loyalty with which Luis bowed himself down before the\r\n   dark and unrelenting tribunal into whose presence he had been\r\n   summoned, sincerely acknowledging its right to all the powers\r\n   it claimed, and submitting faithfully to all its decrees, is\r\n   the saddest proof that can be given of the subjection to which\r\n   intellects the most lofty and the most cultivated had been\r\n   reduced by sinful tyranny, and the most discouraging augury\r\n   of the degradation of the national character that was sure to\r\n   follow.”[122]\r\n\r\nIn 1676, was born Benito Feyjoo, who later became a Benedictine\r\nmonk. While his life was spent in strict retirement (for forty-seven\r\nyears he remained in the convent at Oviedo), the activity of his\r\nthought made him a fire in the community. He wrote a series of papers\r\npublished, in 1726, under the title of the _Critical Theatre_.\r\nIn these, he openly attacked the dialectics and metaphysics then\r\ntaught everywhere in Spain. Few persons at the beginning of the 18th\r\ncentury were so well informed as not to believe in astrology, and fewer\r\nstill doubted the disastrous influence of comets and of eclipses. The\r\nstudy of Copernicus was forbidden to be taught on the ground that\r\nit was contrary to Scripture. The philosophy of Bacon, with all the\r\nconsequences that followed it, were unknown. In spite of the opposition\r\nof the Inquisition, before which Feyjoo was more than once summoned,\r\nit proved to be impracticable to suppress his investigations or his\r\npublications. In 1742, he began a series of discussions published under\r\nthe title _Learned and Enquiring Souls_. The series was finished\r\nin 1760. It was impossible for the Inquisition to assail the soundness\r\nof his faith. Fifteen editions of his principal works were printed in\r\nhalf a century. It is the conclusion of Ticknor that the quiet monk had\r\ndone more for the intellectual life of his country than had been done\r\nin a century.[123]\r\n\r\nTicknor calculates that the number of _auto-da-fés_ during the\r\nreign of Philip V exceeded seven hundred and eighty. It is believed\r\nthat more than twelve thousand persons were, in different ways,\r\nsubjected, under the authority of the Inquisition, to be punished and\r\ndisgraced and that more than one thousand were burned alive. Charles\r\nIII, with the assistance of his liberal ministers, was able so far to\r\nabridge the papal power that no rescript or edict from Rome could have\r\nforce in Spain without the express consent of the throne. He restrained\r\nthe Inquisition from exercising any authority whatever except in\r\ncases of obstinate heresy or apostacy. He forbade the condemnation\r\nof any book until its author or those interested in it had had an\r\nopportunity to be heard in its defence. Finally, deeming the Jesuits\r\nthe most active opponents of the reforms he was intending to enforce,\r\nhe expelled their whole body from his dominions all over the world,\r\nbreaking up their schools and confiscating their great revenues.\r\nCertain abuses were, however, beyond his reach. When he appealed to the\r\nuniversities, urging them to change their ancient habits and to teach\r\nthe truths of the physical and exact sciences, Salamanca answered\r\nin 1771: “Newton teaches nothing that would make a good logician\r\nor metaphysician and Gassendi and Descartes do not agree so well\r\nwith revealed truth as does Aristotle.”[124] The other universities\r\nshowed little more of the spirit of advancement. Under Charles IV, in\r\n1805, the Inquisition, grown forcible in the hands of the Government\r\nas a political machine but still renouncing none of its religious\r\npretensions, came forth with its last _Index expurgatorius_ to\r\nmeet the invasion of French philosophy and insubordination. Acting\r\nunder express instructions from the powers of the State, it instituted\r\nagainst men of letters, and especially against those connected with the\r\nuniversities, an immense number of denunciations which, though rarely\r\nprosecuted to conviction and to punishment, were still formidable\r\nenough to prevent the public expression of opinions on any subject that\r\ncould endanger the social condition of the individual who ventured to\r\nentertain them.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: University of Paris]\r\n\r\n=5. France.=--Duke Philip Augustus in an edict issued in 1200,\r\nconfirmed by St. Louis in 1229 and by Philip the Fair in 1302,\r\ndirected that the cases of university members be brought before the\r\nBishop of Paris. The university found disadvantages in being under the\r\njurisdiction of the bishop (whose censorship later proved particularly\r\ntroublesome for the publishers) and applications were made to replace\r\nthe authority of the ecclesiastical courts with that of the royal\r\ncourts. In 1334, letters patent of Philip of Valois directed the\r\nProvost of Paris, who was at that time considered as the _conservateur_\r\nof the royal privileges, to take the university under his special\r\nprotection, and in 1341, the members of the university were forbidden\r\nto enter proceedings before any other authority. This action brought\r\nthe control of literary production in the university directly under the\r\nauthority of the Crown and constituted a precedent for the contention,\r\nmaintained through the 15th and 16th centuries, for the direct control\r\nby the Crown of the printing-presses. The claim on the part of the\r\nuniversity, however, to control as a portion of the work of higher\r\neducation the business of the makers and the sellers of books, while\r\nsharply attacked and materially undermined during the 17th century,\r\nwas not formally abandoned until the beginning of the 18th. At this\r\ntime, the Crown took to itself all authority to regulate the press, an\r\nauthority which terminated only with the Revolution of 1789.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Paris]\r\n\r\nThe first printing-office in France was established in 1469 by Gering,\r\nKrantz, and Friburger from Constance. At the request of two of the\r\ndivines of the Sorbonne, space was given for the printing-office in\r\none of the halls of the college. An edict of Louis XII, issued April\r\n9, 1513, confirms and extends the privileges previously acquired by\r\nbooksellers as officials of the university. In this edict, Louis speaks\r\nwith appreciation and admiration of the printing art, “the discovery\r\nof which appears to be rather divine than human.” He congratulates his\r\nkingdom that in the development of this art “France takes precedence\r\nof all other realms.”[125] A year later, the King places on record his\r\nopinion that dramatic productions and representations should be left\r\nfree from any restrictions. In 1512, the King writes to the university\r\nrequesting the theological faculty to examine a book that had been\r\ncondemned as heretical by the Council of Pisa. In place, however, of\r\ndemanding that measures of severity should be taken against the writer,\r\nthe King proposed that the professors should go over the book chapter\r\nby chapter and should present a refutation of any of its conclusions\r\nthat seemed to them to be contrary to the truth. It was hardly possible\r\nthat so fair a spirit of toleration should long continue. The spirit\r\nof the time was stronger than the power of any one king and it was\r\nimpossible in the 16th century that the Church and the State could\r\npermit the free development and the unrestricted expression of thought.\r\n\r\nIn 1500, the publisher Badius, who had been selected by the theological\r\nfaculty for printing certain of its censorial works, issued an edition\r\nof the _Regula S. Benedicti_, the famous Rule which had exercised\r\nso important and so abiding an influence on the literature and the\r\nintellectual development of Europe. The leading publisher in Paris\r\nbetween the years 1496 and 1520 was Henry Estienne. The so-called\r\nheretical opinions of Estienne rendered him obnoxious to the doctors\r\nof the Sorbonne and if it had not been for the special interference\r\nof Francis I, by whom his learning and his merits were held in high\r\nesteem, his life would more than once have been in jeopardy. His\r\nopponents succeeded, however, in procuring his expulsion from the\r\nuniversity, and, driven from Paris, he was compelled to seek the\r\nprotection of the Queen of Navarre. The case is one of a long series of\r\ninstances in which the liberal views and scholarly interests of King\r\nFrancis brought him into conflict with the doctors of the Sorbonne.\r\nIn the end, however, the theological faculty, backed by the majority\r\nof the ecclesiastics of France and by the influence of the Papacy,\r\nproved too strong for the liberal tendencies of the Crown. With the\r\ntriumph of Catholic orthodoxy in France, the leading publishers and\r\ntheir scholarly editors found so many difficulties placed in the way\r\nof their undertakings that these could no longer be carried on to\r\nadvantage in Paris. The chief trouble was due to the ignorance and\r\nsuspiciousness of the doctors of the Sorbonne. These doctors possessed\r\nat this period little or no knowledge of Greek and were inclined to\r\nimagine that any Greek sentence must contain or might contain some\r\ndangerous heresy.[126] Any critical analysis of Latin texts which, in\r\nsome earlier, and usually imperfect or defective, form, had received\r\nthe approval of the Church, also seemed to the divines likely to\r\nprove dangerous, and in any case, constituted a reflection upon the\r\northodox scholarship of the previously accepted versions. Their\r\napprehensions became most keen and their indignation most active when\r\nthe “new criticism” (as they probably called it) was applied to the\r\ntext of the Scriptures, whether for the purpose of correcting the\r\nearly clumsy Latinised versions of the New Testament or of securing\r\nmore accurate rendering of the texts of the Hebrew books. During the\r\nfirst half-century of printing, however, the production of editions of\r\nthe Scriptures constituted the most important division of publishing\r\nundertakings. It is not surprising, therefore, that the printers who\r\nwere giving their time and their capital to the preparation of these\r\neditions, and who found themselves hampered and harassed by ignorant\r\nand bigoted censorship, came to the conclusion that the advantages of\r\nParis as a literary and commercial centre were not sufficient to offset\r\nthe continued difficulties and annoyances of such antagonism.\r\n\r\nBy 1540, the ecclesiastical control of the printing-press (exercised\r\nthrough the authority of the university) had become an established and\r\nan obstructive fact. A necessary result of the antagonism of the Church\r\nto critical scholarship was to drive into the ranks of sympathisers\r\nwith the reformers, if not into Protestantism itself, very many of the\r\nscholars who at the outset were not reformers and who were not keenly\r\ninterested in the theological issues of the period, but who felt a\r\nnatural indignation at the reiterated interference with scholarly\r\nundertakings on the part of very ignorant men. The scholars engaged in\r\npreparing for the public critical editions of the world’s literature\r\nasked to be let alone, but they asked in vain.\r\n\r\nIn 1546, the doctors of the Sorbonne secured the insertion in the\r\nprohibitory Index of Louvain of the edition of the Bible that had\r\njust been printed by Robert Estienne; but later in the same year,\r\nthe King prohibited the printing or the circulation in France of the\r\nIndex of Louvain. The King also issued a brief ordering the divines to\r\nwithdraw their strictures upon the Estienne Bible. With the death of\r\nthe King in 1547, the prohibition of the Bible was, however, renewed.\r\nIn 1552, Estienne, deprived of the protection of King Francis, is\r\nfinally compelled to close his printing office and to remove to Geneva.\r\nEstienne did not, however, find Protestant Geneva a place of liberal\r\ntoleration. The year after his arrival, he witnessed the burning, under\r\nthe authority of Calvin, of the heretical scholar Servetus, and more\r\nthan once during the later years of his work in Geneva, the Estienne\r\npublications came under the condemnation of the Calvinistic censorship.\r\nHenry Estienne (the second) completed, in 1562, the publication of\r\ncertain theological works which had been left unfinished in Geneva at\r\nthe time of his father’s death. Among these, were an Exposition of the\r\nNew Testament and an Exposition of the Psalms. The editor, a certain\r\nMarloratus, a Huguenot minister at Rouen, was unfortunately, before\r\nthe printing was completed, hanged as a heretic, under the direction\r\nof the Duke of Guise, but the books themselves were not suppressed\r\nnor was the publisher interfered with. The faculty of the Sorbonne\r\nappears for the time to have suspended its censorious watchfulness over\r\nheretical publications, perhaps because it found its hands sufficiently\r\nfull with the active work of suppressing, by fire, gibbet, and sword,\r\nthe heretics themselves. Henry found it later, however, good policy\r\nto divide his publishing undertakings, executing at Paris reprints of\r\nthe classics and works in general literature, and reserving for his\r\npress at Geneva theological works which were likely to give offence\r\nin a period of “religious irritation.” This term is, I may mention,\r\nMaittaire’s, and it is perhaps not too strong a description of a period\r\nin which a divine who had taken no part in politics could be hanged\r\nsimply for editing a Protestant commentary.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Geneva]\r\n\r\nIn 1589, the city of Geneva was being besieged by the Duke of Savoy.\r\nThe city contained at the time a population of about 12,000 and was\r\nable to muster for its defence 2186 men capable of bearing arms.\r\nAgainst this little force, the Duke brought up an army of 18,000\r\nregular troops with the determination of destroying once for all this\r\n“nest of heretics.” The destruction of the city was earnestly urged\r\nby St. Francis de Sales. The schools and the printing-presses were\r\nparticularly pointed out by St. Francis as instruments of mischief.\r\nThe powers that determine events were this time not in accord with the\r\nsaint. The city survived a siege lasting for nine years, although at\r\nits close it had lost out of its little levy nearly three fourths.\r\nCasaubon tells us that in his time (he is writing in 1595) the\r\nministers of Geneva exercised a strict surveillance over both the work\r\nof teaching and that of publishing. A professor in the academy was not\r\npermitted to publish until his book had passed through the censorship\r\nof the divines. It seems probable that the Calvinistic scrutiny in\r\nGeneva, during the last ten years of the 16th century, may easily have\r\nproved in its narrowness and persistency a more serious obstacle in the\r\nway of publishing undertakings and of scholarship than the censorship\r\nof the Catholic theologians of Paris.\r\n\r\nCasaubon secured, in 1600, at the instance of his friend De Vic,\r\nappointment as Keeper of the Royal Library. This library contained at\r\nthe time about nine hundred works, a large proportion of which were in\r\nmanuscript. The collection of Greek manuscripts was said to be second\r\nonly to that of the Vatican.[127] The new librarian found favour with\r\nthe King although Henry IV was by no means a scholar. Scaliger says of\r\nhim that he could not keep his countenance and could not read a book.\r\nThe great minister Sully was, however, critical of any expenditure for\r\nliterature. “You cost the King too much, sir,” said Sully to Casaubon;\r\n“your pay exceeds that of two good captains, and you are of no use to\r\nthe country.”[128]\r\n\r\nA letter from the papal nuncio at Paris, written in 1562 to Pius IV,\r\nmakes reference to a statement made to the nuncio by Monsieur de\r\nBourbon, to the effect that a few days earlier he had confiscated\r\nfrom a vessel a quantity of heretical books “of the most distressing\r\ncharacter that can be conceived.” These books were packed in wine casks\r\nand had been sent from Geneva. He had consigned them to the flames. No\r\nreference is made to the importer.[129]\r\n\r\nSacchino, historian of the Jesuits, writing in 1526, refers to the\r\nheretical city of Geneva as responsible for the introduction into\r\nLyons of _vim infinitam librorum pestiferorum_ (“a great mass of\r\npestiferous literature,”) prepared for circulation not only in France\r\nbut in Constantinople. He states further, however, that owing to the\r\nefforts of the zealous Possevinus, the books were seized and burned\r\n(_Ut pestilentium illa farrago voluminum flammis aboliretur_).[130]\r\n\r\nThe interest of Francis in scholarship and the influence of Budaeus and\r\nother scholars led him to approve the scheme for a Royal College to\r\nbe devoted more particularly to instruction in the ancient languages.\r\nThe authorities of the university were, with hardly an exception,\r\nbitterly opposed to the plan of the new college. The argument on the\r\npart of the university was presented before the Parliament of Paris\r\nby Galliard. He urged that “to propagate the knowledge of the Greek\r\nand Hebrew languages would operate to the absolute destruction of all\r\nreligion.” “Were these professors theologians,” he asked, “that they\r\nshould pretend to explain the Bible? Were not, indeed, the very Bibles\r\nof which they made use, in large part printed in Germany, the region of\r\nheresy? Or at least were they not indebted for them to the Jews?” The\r\nrejoinder on the part of the new professors was made through Marillac.\r\n“We make no pretensions,” said the professors, “to the name or the\r\nfunction of theologians. It is as philologists or grammarians only\r\nthat we undertake to explain the Greek and Hebrew Scriptures. If you,\r\nwho are criticising our teachings, possess any knowledge of Greek or\r\nHebrew, you are at liberty to attend our lectures and, if you find any\r\nheresy in our instruction, to denounce us. If, however, you are yet\r\nignorant of Greek and Hebrew, on what grounds can you base your fitness\r\nas censors or your claims to forbid us to teach in these tongues?” The\r\nvictory rested with the scholars and the Collège Royal maintained its\r\nground and increased in influence and importance.[131] Maittaire quotes\r\nin this connection the testimony of Heresbach, who says that, in 1540,\r\nhe heard in a sermon delivered in Paris the following statement: “A\r\nnew language has been discovered which they call Greek. Against this\r\nyou must be carefully on your guard for it is the infant tongue of\r\nall heresies. There is a book written in that language called the New\r\nTestament. It is _un livre plein de ronces et de vipères_. As to\r\nthe Hebrew tongue, it is well known that all who learn it presently\r\nbecome Jews.”\r\n\r\nIn 1685, a royal edict was issued by Louis XIV, ordering the\r\ndestruction of all heretical books and the punishment of those who\r\nshould retain copies of the same. As a result of the edict, the\r\nParliament of Paris issued a decree appointing the Archbishop of\r\nParis to prepare an _Index prohibitorius_ of books which in his\r\njudgment ought to be suppressed, an instruction which was carried out\r\nwith all promptness. The list of the archbishop comprised the names\r\nof about five hundred authors. The books condemned were those of the\r\nLutherans, Socinians, Arminians, and Greeks. Included with these\r\nwere all versions of the Scriptures. The Parliament published at once\r\na decree enforcing the prohibition and commanding a strict search to\r\nbe made for such books in the bookshops and printeries and also in\r\nprivate houses. Many books were burned, including a large number of\r\ncopies of the Scriptures. The protection, or toleration, heretofore, in\r\nform at least, extended to Protestants was during the same year, 1685,\r\nwithdrawn by the Edict of Fontainebleau, repealing the Edict of Nantes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lyons]\r\n\r\nThe printers of Lyons succeeded in building up, within a very few\r\nyears after the introduction of printing into France, a profitable\r\nbusiness. They had the advantage of being well out of the way of both\r\necclesiastical and political censorship. They were quite prepared to\r\ntake up promptly editions of books which had been prohibited in Paris\r\nand in Rome, or later in Geneva. They were also among the earliest to\r\ndevelop the art of what may be called piratical printing. The great\r\nexpense of the production of earlier editions, more particularly of\r\nthe classics, was the outlay for scholarly editing. The printers of\r\nLyons promptly discovered that they could make money by utilising the\r\nexpenditures of Aldus in Venice, or of the scholarly printers in Paris,\r\nthrough the appropriation of editorial material. They brought out\r\neditions printed with the text that had been shaped in Venice and in\r\nsome cases in direct imitation of the typography of these first and so\r\nto speak authorised editions. By the year 1495, there were no less than\r\nforty printers doing active work in Lyons, a number considerably in\r\nexcess of those who were then carrying on business in Paris.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1526, the university of Paris had authorised the printing of\r\ncertain dissertations written by the rector Noël Béda against Fabri and\r\nErasmus. King Francis wrote to the Parliament directing it to cause the\r\nsale of these books to be prohibited. He added the general instruction\r\nthat no books, even such as might have been written by members of\r\nthe university, were to be printed or sold which had not first been\r\nexamined and approved by the members of the court deliberating\r\ntogether. It would appear from the King’s letter that he had sufficient\r\nsympathy with the reformers to be unwilling to have Erasmus attacked,\r\nand also that even in matters of theological doctrine, the final\r\ndecision was entrusted, not to the faculty of theology, but to the\r\ncourt of Parliament. By 1531, however, the King had decided that, for\r\ntheological questions at least, the responsibility for the control of\r\nliterary production had better be left with the Sorbonne. In this year\r\nhe gave a direct royal authorisation to the publisher Badius for the\r\nprinting of the big treatise of Alberto Pio against Erasmus, which\r\ntreatise had been duly approved by the divines. The fury of civil war\r\nand the bitterness of religious dissension gave a special character to\r\nthe laws affecting printing and publishing and to the enforcement of\r\nthese. In 1545, Etienne Polliot was sentenced for importing and selling\r\nheretical books. He was compelled to carry a bundle of his publications\r\nto the market-place, where he and his books were burned together. In\r\n1546, the publisher Etienne Dolet, himself the author of a number of\r\nbooks, was burned in the Place Maubert, for his obstinate persistence\r\nin heresy. The ordinances of 1557 and 1560 punished with death, as\r\nguilty of treason, the printers, authors, sellers, and distributors\r\nof books which had been condemned as pernicious or libellous. The\r\nletters patent of 1563 fixed the penalty of hanging or strangling\r\nfor the offence of printing a book without a royal authorisation. The\r\nordinance of Moulins, of 1566, renews the same prohibition. Vitet[132]\r\npoints out that the wars of the League had influence in securing a\r\ncertain freedom for publishing. The government of the League did not\r\nundertake to free from restrictions the printing-presses of Paris. It\r\nprohibited them, however, only from such undertakings as seemed likely\r\nto prove of service to the enemies of the League. On the other hand,\r\nthere was at Tours a government which was hostile only to such writings\r\nas were not royalist, and at Geneva another government the censures of\r\nwhich affected only that literature which was not Protestant. Through\r\nthese three limited censures came into existence three fragments of\r\npublishing freedom. The power of the printing-press in influencing\r\npublic opinion may, as far as France is concerned, be said to date\r\nfrom this period. Under the provisions of the Edict of Nantes, which\r\nbears date 1598, the production and sale of Protestant books were\r\nrestricted to certain specified States and districts in which the\r\npublic exercise of said religion was authorised. These Protestant\r\nbooks, while permitted to exist, are, however, classified as “libels\r\nand as inflammatory writings.” It does not appear that any provision\r\nwas made for the circulation of such publications between the cities in\r\nwhich they were permitted to be printed, as such circulation must, of\r\ncourse, have taken them across the “good Catholic” territory, within\r\nthe boundaries of which the Protestant books were incendiary libels.\r\nThe difficulties in the way of authors and publishers of such books\r\nmust, therefore, at this time have been very considerable. In 1624,\r\nfour royal censors were instituted by letters patent. The first four\r\nwere all doctors of the theological faculty, but notwithstanding this\r\nselection of the board from the members of the Sorbonne, the university\r\nwas dissatisfied with losing its ancient privileges of controlling\r\ndirectly the examination of religious literature. In 1629, it was\r\nordered that works submitted for publication were to be passed upon\r\nby censors particularly designated for each work by the Chancellor or\r\nPrivy Seal. It is probable that the volumes had to be put into type\r\nbefore the examiners were willing to give the time for examination. In\r\n1702, an issue arose between the chancellor and the higher clergy on\r\nthe question of certain general privileges in regard to printing which\r\nthe bishops claimed to be still in force. It was the contention of\r\nthe bishops that, being themselves the final judges of the doctrines\r\nof the Church, utterances made by them or utterances accepted by\r\nthem could not with propriety be passed upon by others who were not\r\nauthorities on points of doctrine. Madame de Maintenon gave the weight\r\nof her influence in favour of the bishops. The King dreaded exciting\r\nthe ire of the Jesuits and dreaded also, says the chronicle, the risk\r\nof putting Madame de Maintenon into a bad temper. He avoided making a\r\ndecision and an adjustment was finally arrived at in which the bishops\r\nwithdrew their main pretensions. Bossuet made an indignant protest\r\nagainst what he called the attempt of the chancellor to control the\r\nutterances of the Church. It is not to be thought of, says Bossuet,\r\nthat the Holy Church of Christ shall be compelled to submit, for the\r\nexamination of magistrates, its decrees, catechisms, and spiritual\r\nteachings upon matters which should be confined strictly to the\r\ninstructors of their flock. The King, influenced by the pleading of\r\nBossuet, finally brought himself to decide that for the works which\r\nwere at the moment in question, the authority should be left with the\r\nbishops.\r\n\r\nThe reports concerning the extent of the influence of censorship, from\r\none authority or another, on the literary activities of France are,\r\nas we have seen, conflicting. The authority of the Sacred Office was,\r\nas stated, not accepted in France, and the work of the French writers\r\nof the 16th century was not seriously affected by the condemnations\r\nand expurgations, sometimes severe and sometimes indulgent, with which\r\nwas supervised and restricted the literature of Italy. It is contended\r\nnevertheless (at least by French historians) that the productions\r\nof the French writers of the century, freer from the trammels of\r\ncensorship as these writers were, represented a higher standard\r\nof morality and of refinement than characterised the contemporary\r\nliterature of Italy.\r\n\r\nDuring the 17th century, persistent attempts were made in France as\r\nin other Catholic States to enforce throughout the realm a policy of\r\ncensorship. By one set of authorities, investigations are carried on\r\nin the bookshops and in public and private libraries, and copies of\r\nobnoxious or suspicious books are burned at the hands of the hangman;\r\nby another, St. Cyran is placed in prison and Arnauld and others of\r\nhis group are driven into exile. The _Lettres Provinciales_ of\r\nPascal are indeed brought into print, but only by cleverly eluding\r\nthe vigilance of the inspectors. It is nevertheless the case that at\r\nno time during the century did it prove to be practicable to keep in\r\nforce, through the entire territory of the State, any consistent or\r\neffective policy. The authority to order proceedings against authors\r\nor to make condemnations of books is not, as was the case in Spain, in\r\nthe hands of a special tribunal, all-powerful and irresponsible. In the\r\nplace of an Index which preserves the record of a condemnation that\r\nhas once been pronounced, we have individual edicts or orders which\r\neasily fall into oblivion; and in place of a Congregation or of an\r\nInquisition, we find distinct authorities, and sometimes simple local\r\nauthorities, the actions of which are more or less conflicting and\r\nlack permanency of influence. There is also throughout the century, as\r\nlater, among the ecclesiastics themselves, a strong national feeling\r\nof protest against the exercise within the territory of France of\r\ncensorship authority directed by Italians or Spaniards.[133]\r\n\r\nWhile in Italy, the Church labours single-handed at the task of\r\nreforming the people, in France it is the entire nation, without\r\ndistinction of ecclesiastics and laymen, that undertakes the\r\nreformation of itself. Frenchmen of the 17th century, equally assured\r\nof their devotion to the true faith and of their intention to maintain\r\nthe virtues of Christianity, refuse to admit the necessity for\r\nsubmitting to a theocracy, a religious dictatorship, and for putting\r\nliterature, so to speak, into a state of siege.\r\n\r\nDejob cites, on the authority of the Benedictine editors, a number\r\nof the absurdities introduced into the St. Ambrose text by the Roman\r\neditors, and concludes that “editorial methods so naïve and so\r\nunscrupulous were certainly in need of the aid of the Index in order\r\nto prevent, through the collation of their text with the work of\r\nmore faithful scholars, the unmasking of their pious infidelities.”\r\n“What,” he exclaims, “would have been the result for scholarship,\r\nfor literature, and for the thought of the world, if the Inquisition\r\nhad succeeded in establishing its domination throughout Europe, and\r\nin placing all the manuscripts of the Fathers under the keys of the\r\nVatican?”[134]\r\n\r\nDom Petra, one of the learned editors of the _Acta Sanctorum_,\r\nwrites in 1649: “If Rome condemns our books, the Jansenists will\r\nhave a text for saying that this is brought about by intrigue and\r\ncorruption.... The Congregation [of the Index] appears to object to\r\nthe work done by the editors of our _Acta_ in the correction\r\nof errors; but the Congregation should understand that, rather than\r\nto confirm a record of impostures, we prefer to write nothing; the\r\nCongregation is giving an opportunity to the heretics to point out\r\nthe unwillingness of the Papists to make corrections or to remedy\r\nabuses.”[135]\r\n\r\nTheophile Raynaud, in order to revenge himself for a condemnation\r\nissued against his books by certain Dominican inquisitors, undertook\r\nthe defence, against the Dominicans, of the memory of Reuchlin and\r\nof Erasmus, victims, as he contends, of Dominican ignorance and\r\ncalumny.[136]\r\n\r\nWriting in 1661, in reference to certain copies of his books that\r\nhad been seized in Italy, Raynaud says: “The sovereign pontiff gives\r\nauthority, it appears, to his ministers to carry on robbery.”[137]\r\n\r\nThe only portion of the writings of Rabelais that came under the ban of\r\nthe French censors was the fourth book of the _Pantagruel_, which\r\nwas prohibited by the divines of the Sorbonne.\r\n\r\nThe writings of Montaigne were prohibited in 1576 by the Congregation\r\nof the Index but the prohibition was not confirmed in France. In\r\n1595, an expurgated edition of the _Essays_ was published at Lyons,\r\nfrom which was omitted, together with certain other passages, under\r\nthe instructions of the censors, the fifth chapter of the third\r\nbook. The twenty-ninth chapter of the first book, apparently equally\r\nreprehensible, escaped condemnation.\r\n\r\n“I find,” says Dejob, “no book of importance, excepting the _Tartuffe_\r\nof Molière, that the national authorities attempted to suppress.\r\nMolière, Racine, La Bruyère, were from time to time assailed, but there\r\nwere always influences working on their behalf strong enough to prevent\r\nany serious or continued interference with their work. Once, it may\r\nbe remembered, Richelieu _se ligua contre le Cid_, but the immediate\r\nprotest of the public made clear to the minister that he was on a false\r\ntrack.”[138]\r\n\r\nIt is certain that the authority of the Church exercised in France\r\na much smaller influence over literature than either in Spain or in\r\nItaly. In fact, under Louis XIV, the Church found it necessary to\r\nresort to raillery rather than to discipline in the cases in which it\r\nfound ground for criticism.\r\n\r\nThe learned historian of the Benedictines, Mabillon, brought himself\r\ninto criticism on the part of the Papacy through proving that the bones\r\ntaken from the catacombs, which were being distributed as relics for\r\nthe faithful, had belonged neither to saints nor to martyrs.\r\n\r\nDejob is of opinion that the acknowledged superiority of the\r\ntheological writers of France during the 17th century over those of\r\nItaly and Spain was chiefly due to the greater freedom possessed by\r\nthe French scholars in carrying on their investigations and in bringing\r\ntheir books into print.[139]\r\n\r\nThe intellectual work of the orthodox clergy owes not a little to the\r\nfeeling of obligation that rested upon them to offset the influence of\r\nthe Huguenot controversialists and to secure for orthodox literature\r\na prestige to balance that of Arnaud and of Pascal. It may fairly be\r\nclaimed that the Church of France showed itself equal to the task. Any\r\nnation may have been proud to produce within the term of a century\r\nfive writers or scholars whose names could be compared with those of\r\nBossuet, Fénelon, Bourdaloue, Malebranche, and Mabillon. No religion\r\nhas counted among its ministers during any one generation men superior\r\nto these in intellectual force. Catholicism can refer to this group as\r\nan evidence that orthodoxy does not stifle originality of talent. It\r\ncan claim further that the acceptance of dogma does not of necessity\r\ninvolve the renunciation of scientific and philosophical investigation.\r\nThe lay writers of this famous century were hardly less influenced\r\nby the spirit of religion. It is this that inspired Corneille and\r\nRacine, not only in such creations as _Polyeucte_ and _Athalie_, but\r\nin the moral conception with which they handle the subject of love;\r\nit is this which retains within wholesome limits the satirical verse\r\nof Boileau and of La Bruyère and which keeps within bounds even the\r\nbitter personalities of St.-Simon; it is this which raises far beyond\r\nthe level of feminine curiosity and maternal egoism the writings of\r\nMme. de Sévigné, and which imbues with eloquence the work of Mme. de\r\nMotteville.[140]\r\n\r\nThe religious spirit may be said to have influenced also the work of\r\nMolière, who uses his trenchant pen to emphasise our obligations to\r\nmorality. Save in an occasional instance where the manners of the\r\ncomedian get control of the pen of the poet, these obligations are set\r\nforth with the certainty of an infallible moralist, while the dramatist\r\nsucceeds in securing for his readers (or hearers) full sympathy for\r\nthose of his characters which show themselves faithful to wholesome\r\nideals.\r\n\r\nIf it had been possible for the fathers who directed the work of\r\nthe Council of Trent to have knowledge of this wonderful body of\r\nliterature, which gave to Catholicism an incomparable intellectual\r\néclat, they would surely have admitted that their pious expectations\r\nwere surpassed.[141]\r\n\r\nThe classical literature of France retained, therefore, freedom of\r\nthought and of expression. The eulogies addressed to the rulers, even\r\nwhen extravagant in form, bore the stamp of sincerity. It was a saying\r\nof La Bruyère that the use of satire in really great subjects was\r\ndenied to writers who were at once Frenchmen and Christians. But it is\r\nfair to remember that such an interdiction is confirmed by the opinion\r\nof the public itself, and also that to one who is himself a witness\r\nof great things, the dazzle of their brilliancy may easily prevent a\r\nclear perception of their blemishes. It is certain that the record of\r\nthe work done by the great writers of France does not give any evidence\r\nof serious interference by the Church either for praise or for blame.\r\nApart from the _Lettres Provinciales_ (which after all secured\r\na wide reading and a general appreciation), no work of the first\r\nimportance was brought under condemnation by the authorities either\r\ncivil or religious.[142]\r\n\r\n\r\n=6. Germany.=--Within half a century after the invention of printing\r\nin Mayence, the business of publishing was established in a number of\r\ntowns, such as Frankfort, Strasburg, Basel, Cologne, and Nuremberg;\r\nand by the close of the 16th century, the work of the printers became\r\nimportant also in many towns of North Germany, such as Leipsic,\r\nMagdeburg, Wittenberg, etc. The development of the production of\r\nprinted books followed very largely the lines of the trade in\r\nmanuscripts which it superseded. The sale of manuscripts had, for the\r\ncentury before printing, constituted an important item in the business\r\nof the Fair at Frankfort, and after 1480, we find entries in the\r\nannual records of the Fair of sales of printed books. The organisation\r\nof the book-trade of the empire dates from about 1525. Frankfort was\r\nestablished as the centre or headquarters of this trade, and the Fair\r\nbrought to the city twice a year representative publishers and dealers\r\nnot only from the towns of Germany but from Italy, France, and the\r\nNetherlands.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of a centre or headquarters for the book-trade\r\nof Europe was, of course, of immediate advantage in furthering the\r\nknowledge and the distribution of the literature that came into print,\r\nand particularly of the books published in Latin. Latin was generally\r\naccepted throughout the world as the language not only of scholarship,\r\nbut of literature, and it was therefore selected by the publishers of\r\nthe time for the larger portion of the books brought into print. It is\r\ntrue that the work of the early printers of Germany was, unlike that of\r\nFrance and the Netherlands, carried on not in university centres, but,\r\nvery largely at least, in commercial towns. The lists of these German\r\nprinters contain a much larger number of books addressed to the general\r\nor unscholarly public than was the case with those of their competitors\r\nin Paris, Venice, or Leyden, but in Germany also the production of\r\nworks printed in Latin, for the trade of the world, became each year of\r\nincreasing importance.\r\n\r\nFor the operations of the general censorship of the Church, the\r\norganisation of the book-trade presented certain advantages or at least\r\nconveniences. The compilers of the earlier Roman Indexes utilised the\r\nbulletins and catalogues of the Book-Fair in securing for their lists\r\ninformation concerning new and forthcoming books of heretical writers\r\nor on controversial subjects. As is mentioned in the separate record of\r\ncertain Indexes, the censors were not infrequently prepared to condemn\r\na book without any examination whatever, simply on the repute of its\r\nauthor, or even on that of its publisher. It occasionally happened, as\r\na result of this method, that a work was prohibited which never came\r\ninto existence, some obstacle having prevented its completion or its\r\npublication after the title had been announced.\r\n\r\nThe first instances of books issued with _Imprimaturs_ are two\r\nprinted at Cologne in 1479 and sanctioned by the university, and a\r\nthird printed at Heidelberg in 1480, under the authorisation of the\r\nPatriarch of Venice.\r\n\r\nThe earliest mandate of which there is record for the appointment of a\r\ncensor of books was issued in 1486 by Berthold, Archbishop of Mayence.\r\nThe Archbishop forbids the translation into the vernacular of any books\r\nfrom Latin, Greek, or other languages, or the sale of translations\r\nbrought in from without, until these have been examined and approved by\r\ncensors appointed for the purpose from the university of Erfurt.[143]\r\nHe instructs the Burgomaster of Frankfort to make examination of all\r\nbooks at the Frankfort Fair before the permit should be given for\r\ntheir sale. In 1524, the Archbishop of Mayence claims, on the double\r\nground of his position as High Chancellor of the empire and as a\r\nrepresentative of the authority of Rome, the right to supervise the\r\nbook-trade of the empire, and he makes immediate application of this\r\nauthority to the control of the sale of books at the Frankfort Fair.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Frankfort]\r\n\r\nIn 1648, the year in which the Thirty Years’ War came to an end, the\r\nmagistrates of Frankfort gave up formally the attempts to supervise the\r\nbook-production of the city. In 1662, the magistrates found occasion\r\nfor protests against the imperial regulations for the control of the\r\nbook-trade. The emperor, in his edict of March 18, 1662, was acting\r\nunder the counsel of his Jesuit advisers. The magistrates were speaking\r\nas the representatives of the publishers, and, as they contended,\r\nfor the interests of the community as a whole. In 1665, under some\r\ncounsel which proved to be very ill-advised, the imperial commissioners\r\nundertook to fix the prices of the books presented for sale at the\r\nFrankfort Fair. It was contended that the commissioners who had been\r\ncharged with the work of censorship had no authority to take upon\r\nthemselves the determination of a business detail. It was very certain\r\nthat they did not have the expert knowledge required for the task, but\r\nit was, of course, the case that no commissioners could have carried\r\nout successfully any such system. This price regulation proved to\r\nbe one of the most effective of the various factors which caused the\r\nreplacing of Frankfort by Leipsic as the centre of the publishing and\r\nbookselling interests of Germany.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Strasburg]\r\n\r\nIn 1488, the city of Strasburg established under the directions of the\r\nemperor a local censorship supervised by the magistracy. The first\r\nbook prohibited under this regulation was the _Germania Nova_ of\r\nMurner, issued in 1502.\r\n\r\nIn 1501, Alexander VI publishes a bull prohibiting the printing, within\r\nthe territories in question, of any books that have not secured an\r\napproval, in the form of a privilege, from the Archbishops of Cologne,\r\nMayence, Treves, and Magdeburg, or from their vicars-general.[144]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Leipsic]\r\n\r\nBy the year 1495, the book-trade of Leipsic had assumed very\r\nconsiderable proportions and was already beginning to rival that of\r\nFrankfort. The Booksellers’ Association, organised (in Frankfort) in\r\n1525, is at the present time, four centuries later, the most effective\r\nand intelligently managed trade organisation that the world has\r\nknown. Leipsic publishers gave from an early period special attention\r\nto the printing of the controversial literature of the Reformation,\r\nand, as was natural from their close relations with Wittenberg, the\r\nsympathies of the larger proportion of the printers were in accord\r\nwith the Lutherans. In 1524, Duke George, who was a Catholic, came\r\nto the throne and during his reign, which continued until 1533, the\r\nwritings of the reformers were repressed by a rigorous censorship. The\r\nDuke utilised the machinery of the trade organisation for putting into\r\neffect the ducal regulations for supervision and censorship, and two\r\necclesiastical censors, appointed under the ducal authority, secured\r\nthe aid of the city officials in making examination of all the books\r\nprinted and in confiscating or cancelling all heretical works found in\r\nthe shops of either Leipsic or Dresden. The immediate result of these\r\nanti-reform operations of the Church and of the Duke was the practical\r\ndestruction for the time being of the book-trade of Leipsic. Many of\r\nthe printers transferred their presses to Wittenberg or Magdeburg.\r\n\r\nIn 1526, occurred in Leipsic an extreme instance of the application\r\nof Catholic censorship. Under the instructions of Duke George, Johann\r\nHerrgott, a printer and colporteur, was burned, with certain of his\r\nbooks, for the crime of distributing Protestant literature. In the next\r\nyear, Hübmayer, the leader of the Baptists in Southern Germany, was\r\nburned in Vienna for a similar offence. In 1571, the Duke of Saxony\r\nordered that the work of the printers should be restricted to three\r\ntowns, Leipsic, Dresden, and Wittenberg. The purpose of this regulation\r\nwas the facilitating of censorship control.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wittenberg]\r\n\r\nIn advance of the aggressive Protestant measures of Luther, Wittenberg\r\nhad already become an important place for book-production, having\r\nsecured, among other favourable influences, the advantage of the\r\ntransfer of certain of the printers and their presses from Leipsic.\r\nAfter 1515, Wittenberg was the most important of the centres from\r\nwhich were distributed throughout Germany the books and pamphlets\r\n(_Flugschriften_) of the reformers. It was in Wittenberg also that\r\nwas brought into print the great Bible of Luther.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magdeburg]\r\n\r\nAt an early date in the period of the Reformation, Magdeburg, in\r\nwhich the printing business had already secured an assured foothold,\r\nhad taken an important place among the centres of distribution of\r\nProtestant literature. The work of the printers was interrupted for\r\na time in 1518 by the repressive measures of the Catholic Albert of\r\nBrandenburg, but after 1528, the presses were again left practically\r\nfree from civil authority, while the ecclesiastical influence in the\r\ncity was never important. The book-trade was crushed out for the time\r\nby the destruction of the city by Tilly in 1631.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Münster]\r\n\r\nThe city of Münster was another centre for Protestant publications.\r\nThe excesses of the Anabaptists, who, under John of Leyden and his\r\nassociates, had possession of the town for a number of months in\r\n1535–36, were, however, well-nigh destructive to its Protestantism\r\nand proved fatal to its publishing business. In 1562, an edict issued\r\nby the bishop ordered the destruction of all Protestant books in\r\nWestphalia and made it a misdemeanour to print, sell, or possess any\r\nsuch books.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Basel]\r\n\r\nThe city of Basel secured at an early date an important position among\r\nthe centres of publishing. The university, founded in 1460, brought\r\nto the city men devoted to scholarly pursuits many of whom took an\r\nearly interest in the work of the printing press and were ready to\r\ngive coöperation to the publishers. In 1501, Basel broke away from the\r\nimperial control. At that time, there were in the city no less than\r\ntwenty-six important publishing and printing concerns.\r\n\r\nDuring the most active period of its publishing interests, Basel had\r\nthe advantage over the majority of the German towns in its comparative\r\nfreedom from censorship either ecclesiastical or civil. The authority\r\nof Rome was permitted to exert practically no restrictions upon the\r\nproductions of the printing-presses; while as a free imperial city, it\r\nhad the right to claim exemption from any authority other than that\r\nof the emperor, whose examiners were too far distant to be able to\r\nbring their influence to bear, to any extent, upon the operations of\r\nthe Basel publishers. It was this freedom that constituted the most\r\nimportant cause of the great development of the book-trade of the\r\ncity during the 15th and 16th centuries. The leader among the great\r\npublishers of Basel, who ranked at the time with Aldus as one of the\r\ngreat publishers of the world, was Johann Froben, the publisher,\r\nfriend, and close associate of Erasmus. It is the imprint of Froben\r\nthat is associated with the most important of the volumes of Erasmus,\r\nincluding not only those that secured the approval of Leo X and of\r\nother of the Church authorities, but the group which brought the author\r\ninto sharp criticism with the ecclesiastical censors. During the years\r\nbetween 1460 and 1500, the popes themselves sent to Basel for printing\r\ncertain books which required more trustworthy work than could be\r\nsecured in Rome.[145]\r\n\r\nIn 1523, the first application for censorship in the city of Basel was\r\nmade by Erasmus in connection with the reprinting of certain French\r\nwritings which he claimed to be libels of himself. The censorship of\r\nthe city was under the direction of the magistrates. The magistrates\r\nforbade the printing of books in any other languages than Latin, Greek,\r\nHebrew, and German. In 1598 the censors of the city required that there\r\nbe placed in their hands catalogues of books that were forthcoming in\r\norder that they might designate those calling for special attention.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Zürich]\r\n\r\nBetween the years 1520 and 1580, the presses of Zürich were busied with\r\nthe production of the works of the Calvinist reformers. Froschauer,\r\nwho was one of the first of the Zürich printers, was a close friend\r\nof Zwingli, whose special tenets he had adopted, and he placed at the\r\ndisposal of the Zwinglians the machinery of his printing concern for\r\nthe production and distribution of the Zwinglian treatises and tracts.\r\nZürich presents also an example of early and strenuous Protestant\r\ncensorship. Zwingli brought about a prohibition on the part of the\r\ncivil authorities of Zürich for the sale within the city of the\r\nLutheran publications.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Augsburg]\r\n\r\nThe city of Augsburg occupied a similar place among the centres of\r\nCatholic book-production to that held by Basel and Zürich for the works\r\nof the Protestants. The presses of the great publisher Koberger and\r\nhis associates were devoted during the last third of the 15th and the\r\nfirst half of the 16th century to the production of editions of the\r\nworks of the more scholarly of the Catholic theologians. The books\r\nwere addressed to scholars and were comparatively high in price. The\r\nwork of the German reformers had as one result the checking of the\r\nactivities of the Augsburg publishers. In 1520, the civil authorities\r\nof Augsburg, at the instance of the local ecclesiastics, issued\r\nprohibitions for the sale in the city of the works of Luther and of\r\nZwingli. It was the multiplicity of prohibitory authorities in the\r\nbook centres of Germany that actually worked against the influence of\r\nthe prohibitory system. There was also in these German cities a lack\r\nof any effective censorship machinery such as existed in Spain either\r\nfor the examination of texts in advance of printing, or for the seizure\r\nof books and the punishment of printers after publication. There were,\r\nduring the century after the Reformation, instances (aggregating a\r\nconsiderable number) of writers who on the ground of their heretical\r\nutterances had been punished in one way or another and some of whom had\r\neven suffered death, but there was no general or effective repression\r\nof literary production and distribution throughout Germany, either on\r\nthe part of the Catholic censors working against Protestant writings\r\nor under the influence of the Protestant divines utilising for the\r\nprohibition of Catholic books the civil authority.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nuremberg]\r\n\r\nIn Nuremberg, under a regulation of 1513, the printers were to be sworn\r\neach year as holding the orthodox Catholic faith and as agreeing to\r\nprint no books contrary to that faith.[146] The magistrates issued in\r\n1518 a special prohibition against the printing of the writings of the\r\nHussites, and in 1521, a similar prohibition against the writings of\r\nLuther, Calvin, and Zwingli. This edict was withdrawn in 1535 when the\r\nmagistracy of the city had become Lutheran. In 1527, the poet-cobbler,\r\nHans Sachs, came under censorship for certain rhymes attached to an\r\nillustrated record of the Tower of Babel. In this case, the trouble\r\nappears, however, to have been not religious, but a matter of guild\r\nprejudice. Sachs, being licensed only as a cobbler, had no authority to\r\ndo work as a poet. After 1535, when the control of Nuremberg had passed\r\ninto the hands of the Protestants, there is a rapid development of the\r\nactivity of its printing-presses and book-trade.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tübingen Breslau]\r\n\r\nThe works of Melanchthon were first printed in Tübingen in 1511.\r\nLater, Melanchthon used for his theological treatises and also for his\r\nlong series of text-books the presses of Wittenberg. The statutes of\r\nthe University of Tübingen in regard to the _Libelli famosi_ were,\r\nin 1500, made binding throughout the electorate of Würtemberg. In 1557,\r\nan edict of the Duke called for an annual visitation of the bookshops\r\nfor the search for heretical publications. In 1593, a ducal permission\r\nwas given to one bookseller in Tübingen, Gruppenbach, to buy for the\r\nuse of the professors two copies of any heretical books called for. In\r\n1601, an ordinance was published in Tübingen prohibiting the sale of\r\nall sectarian or controversial books, Catholic as well as Protestant.\r\nIn the three ecclesiastical principalities of Mayence, Cologne, and\r\nTrier, the ecclesiastical censorship became, after 1525, particularly\r\nrigorous with the result of a material checking in the business of\r\nthe printers and booksellers. In Silesia, Breslau became the centre\r\nof Catholic influence and the Protestant printers were, after 1577,\r\nlargely driven out of business.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Heidelberg]\r\n\r\nIn Heidelberg, under an edict of the Elector of Baden, the censorship\r\ncontrol was, in 1651, placed in the hands of the university and came\r\nunder the direction of the theological faculty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vienna]\r\n\r\nThe printing business in Vienna had during the first years of the\r\n16th century made a good start, but with the beginning of imperial\r\ncensorship under the edict of Ferdinand, in 1523, the work of the\r\nprinters received a check. In this edict the printing, sale, and\r\npossession of the books of Luther is prohibited under heavy penalties.\r\nFerdinand permitted the ecclesiastics to exercise directly (that is to\r\nsay without reference of individual cases to the civil authorities)\r\nthe supervision of the work of the printers. These censors made\r\neffective opposition against scientific education and their repressive\r\nmeasures for literature other than theological was so far effective\r\nthat, after the year 1560, the printing in Vienna of editions of the\r\nclassics was brought to a close. In the year 1572, the printing-office\r\nand bookshop of Creutzer, who had for some years acted as the publisher\r\nof the university, was closed. In the year 1587, the book stock of\r\nNecker, who was at that time the leading bookseller in the city, was\r\nconfiscated and in large part burned. By 1600, the control of the book\r\nbusiness was placed almost exclusively in the hands of the Jesuits and\r\nas a result of their “supervision,” the business practically came to a\r\nclose.\r\n\r\nKapp points out that the prohibitory lists issued in Germany contained,\r\nin addition to the titles of the Protestant controversial writings and\r\nreligious writings other than controversial, the titles of a number\r\nof books which were really in character _contra bonos mores_.\r\nThe advantage of the advertisement given to the books deserving of\r\nexistence was unfortunately shared by not a few volumes which were\r\nreally scandalous in character.\r\n\r\nThe Thirty Years’ War in Germany (1618–1648) may be considered as an\r\nextreme application of the principle of censorship. The power of the\r\nemperor and that of the Catholic princes who associated themselves\r\nwith the emperor, was directed to the suppression of Protestantism in\r\nGermany and with this to the control under the direction of the Roman\r\nChurch of German thought and of German intellectual development. This\r\nwas, of course, an attempt to do something much wider than to control\r\nand restrict the printing-press, but the control and restriction of\r\nthe operations of the printers constituted an essential part of the\r\npurpose of the pope, the emperor, and their allies the Jesuits and\r\nDominicans. In so far as the Catholics held their own, succeeding in\r\nmaintaining their control in the States of South Germany, the printers\r\nhad to accept the continued authority of the ecclesiastics backed by\r\nthe power of the State. The States of North Germany, on the other hand,\r\nwith the all-powerful aid of Gustavus Adolphus and his sturdy Swedes,\r\nwere able to maintain by force of arms their independence as citizens,\r\nand secured also the right to think and to speak, to print and to read\r\nfor themselves, free from decisions to be arrived at by the Dominican\r\nCongregation of Italy or the Jesuit censors of Vienna. The waste of\r\nlife and of treasure brought upon Germany through the thirty years’\r\nstrife was enormous, but even as a matter of material advantage, the\r\ncontest was for North Germany worth all that it had cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n=7. The Netherlands.=--The work of the printers in Holland was\r\nbegun in Utrecht in 1473. The Dutch printers had from the outset the\r\nenormous advantage in their business of a practical freedom from\r\ninterference by censorship, whether ecclesiastical or political. This\r\nwas also true for a quarter of a century or more with the printing\r\ncentres of Flanders, where, under the initiative of Mansion, Caxton,\r\nand their successors, the work of printing was begun, in 1474, in\r\nBruges and in Louvain. In 1476, Caxton migrated from Bruges to London,\r\nsetting up his first press in the courtyard of Westminster Abbey.\r\nThe Dukes of Burgundy had, for several generations prior to the\r\nintroduction of printing, been noted for their liberal interest in\r\nliterature, and for their great collections of manuscripts, and this\r\nsympathetic relation of the Burgundian rulers to literature continued\r\nthrough the first half-century of printing.\r\n\r\nDuring the first three fourths of the 16th century, the Netherlands,\r\nwith Antwerp as a centre, present the type of a most enlightened\r\ncommunity. At the time of the great siege of 1585, Antwerp was at the\r\nheight of its prosperity, and in the extent and the varied character of\r\nits commercial relations it was possibly the leading city of Europe.\r\nAntwerp possessed exceptional advantages as a centre of book-production\r\nand by the close of the 16th century, out of the sixty-five printers\r\nwho were at work in the Netherlands, no less than thirteen were in\r\nAntwerp. The neighbouring University of Louvain supplied scholarly\r\ncoöperation which was essential for all the publishing undertakings\r\nof the age, while not a few scholars, who, some years later, found\r\nthemselves with the exiles in Leyden or in Amsterdam, were at this\r\ntime resident in Antwerp, and were already largely associated with the\r\nwork of the printing-press. In 1556, at the time of the beginning of\r\nthe work of the great publisher Plantin, an entire quarter of the city\r\nwas devoted to the making of books, a circumstance without a parallel\r\namong the cities of Europe. The result of the censorship of the Spanish\r\nGovernment was practically to crush out the book business of Antwerp.\r\nThe presses were largely destroyed and the scholars and printers alike\r\nwere scattered among the towns of Holland. Plantin placed his imprint\r\nupon a number of books of theology, for all of which it was necessary\r\nto secure the approval, with the “royal privilege,” of the Duke of Alva\r\nand of the successors of the Duke who represented the Spanish Throne.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Book Regulations, 1560–1570]\r\n\r\nThe ordinances issued by Philip II concerning books were for the most\r\npart merely a confirmation, with some increase in severity, of the\r\nedicts of Charles V. The modifications in these ordinances brought\r\nabout by the States-General in 1566 provided that those books only\r\nshould be prohibited that contained heretical or pernicious opinions;\r\nand that the responsibility for the examination and decision should be\r\nshared with the theologians by the scholars of the other university\r\nfaculties; that instructors should be at liberty to utilise all books\r\nnot on the prohibited lists; and that the visitation to the bookshops\r\nshould be made only under the direct authority of the magistrates.\r\nUnder Alva, the routine for such a visitation was to instruct the\r\nmagistrates on a specific day (not announced in advance) to place seals\r\non the doors of all printing-offices and bookshops; the examination of\r\nthe books was then carried out by the suffragan bishop and the local\r\nhead of the Franciscans. In the years 1566 and 1567, four printers were\r\nsentenced to banishment for from four to six years, one was sent to the\r\ngalleys, and one was hanged.[147]\r\n\r\nIn 1570, Philip II instituted the office of “proto-typographer” or\r\nsupervisor of printing for the Netherlands, and appointed as the first\r\noccupant of the office the printer Plantin. Master-printers applying\r\nto the supervisor for authorisation for a work to be printed must\r\nshow the certificate of approval of the diocesan bishop or of his\r\nvicar, and also of the local magistrate. Printers were required to\r\ntake an oath of conformity to the doctrines of the Church as set forth\r\nby the Council of Trent. No remuneration was attached to the office\r\nof proto-typographer, but the incumbent was freed from the duty of\r\nlodging soldiers. The important service of the post for Plantin was,\r\nof course, the increased facility it secured for him in obtaining\r\napprovals and privileges for his own publications. The theologians of\r\nLouvain (through whom the ecclesiastical censorship for Antwerp was,\r\nin the main, carried on) were not likely to raise question concerning\r\nthe undertakings of the literary representative of the King. It was\r\nsuggested that one ground for his selection was the wish of the King\r\nto make good to Plantin the loss that had been caused to his business\r\nby his arrest in 1562 on a charge of heretical publishing, a charge\r\nwhich proved to be unfounded. It may also be recalled that Philip\r\nhad promised, in 1568, to pay to Plantin the sum of 21,000 florins\r\nas a subvention for the polyglot Bible, edited by Montanus. This\r\npayment was, however, never made, and the failure to receive it was\r\none of the causes that had, in 1570, brought Plantin into financial\r\ndifficulties.[148]\r\n\r\nUnder the ordinance of 1570, the censorship is lodged with the\r\ncouncil, the bishop, and the inquisitor. Each book that may secure\r\ntheir approval is to be referred to the stadtholder, by whom its\r\nselling price shall be fixed. Inspection of the printing-offices must\r\nbe made from time to time by the bishop, the inquisitor, and the\r\nproto-typographer, and not less than twice a year by the magistrates.\r\nThe booksellers must take oath that without permit from the censors\r\nthey will bring in no book from abroad; that they will sell, except to\r\na buyer with a written permit, no copies, printed in the vernacular,\r\nof the Scriptures or of controversial writings; and that they will\r\nfaithfully obey all the regulations of these ordinances and of the\r\nRoman Index (that of Trent, printed as an appendix to the ordinances);\r\nall packages of imported books are to be opened only in the presence of\r\nthe bishop or of the inquisitor.\r\n\r\nIn 1573, it was ordered that of all the books printed in the\r\nNetherlands, one copy should be delivered to the royal library at\r\nAntwerp, and a second (to be paid for) to the Escurial.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1569. Liège (Lüttich)]\r\n\r\nHenricus Hovius printed in Liège, in 1569, an edition of the Index\r\nof Trent in which (without any reference or specification) certain\r\nadditional names and titles have been inserted in the alphabetical\r\nlists. The title-page states that the Index has been prepared under\r\nthe authority of King Philip, and in accordance with a decree of the\r\nDuke of Alva. The new titles, probably added at the instance of the\r\ndivines of Louvain, are for the most part repeated in the Antwerp Index\r\nof 1570. Reusch points out that this Liège Index is very carelessly\r\nprinted and is full of errors.\r\n\r\nThe prohibitions of the Trent Index were confirmed under the authority\r\nof the diocesan synods of the Spanish Netherlands. One of the diocesan\r\nedicts required the printers and booksellers each year to take an\r\noath of fidelity to the faith of the Church, in default of which the\r\nlicense to print was to be forfeited. In 1589, the Synod of Tournai\r\nprohibited the booksellers from possessing a copy of the _Index\r\nlibrorum haereticorum_, a catalogue printed yearly for the use of\r\nthe Frankfort Book-Fair, which was based upon the lists of the Index\r\nof Trent, but the titles in which were from year to year brought\r\ndown to date. The book-dealers were already beginning to realise the\r\nvalue for their business of the labour expended by the Church in the\r\npreparation of bibliographies of the books which were most likely\r\nto prove of interest to the active minded people of the world. This\r\nFrankfort catalogue of heretical books was the beginning of a series of\r\nsuch catalogues in which the work of the Congregation of the Index and\r\nof the Inquisition was taken advantage of (with material improvements\r\nin the accuracy of the bibliography) to emphasise the value and to\r\nfurther the circulation of the books which had been condemned by the\r\nChurch. The edict of the bishops who met at Tournai in 1589 appears to\r\nhave been the first expression of doubt on the part of ecclesiastical\r\nauthorities as to the effectiveness of the condemnations of the Index\r\nin lessening the circulation and the influence of heretical literature.\r\n\r\nIn 1585, through the recognition of the independence of the Dutch\r\nRepublic, the long contests in the Netherlands were brought to a\r\nclose. The authority of the Spanish King was restored in Antwerp but\r\nthe city was impoverished as to both men and resources. Irrespective\r\nof the loss of life in the great city, Antwerp had suffered the loss\r\nof some of the best and most enterprising of its citizens who had\r\npreferred to make their home in the Protestant communities of Holland.\r\nThe departing Protestants took with them much of the intellectual life\r\nand literary activity in the city, while Amsterdam and Leyden, free\r\nfrom the hampering restrictions of Catholic censorship, presented\r\nmany advantages for publishing undertakings. In 1585, there was but\r\none book printing-press in activity in the city in which a few years\r\nearlier there had been no less than forty. Plantin’s first publication\r\nfor the new year was an official list of the books at that time under\r\nprohibition, the list comprising some six hundred titles.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, in view of the hampering regulations and\r\nrestrictions above specified, that the book-trade of the Spanish\r\nNetherlands should have become demoralised and that the centres of\r\npublishing activities should have been transferred from Antwerp and\r\nLouvain to Amsterdam, Utrecht, and Leyden.\r\n\r\nAmong the Protestants who during this war period migrated from Flanders\r\nwas Louis Elzevir, who removed from Louvain to Leyden and began there\r\nthe business which developed later into one of the greatest publishing\r\nhouses of the world. The coöperation of the scholars of the university,\r\ntogether with an absolute freedom from any censorship restrictions,\r\ngave to the new publishing concern advantages which were at that time\r\npossessed by no printer-publishers outside of Holland. The development\r\nof the book-trade of Holland was furthered thirty years later through\r\nthe influence of the Thirty Years’ War in Germany. During this period,\r\n1618–1648, the territory of the Seven United Provinces was free alike\r\nfrom invaders and from civil strife. Much of the work of the scholars\r\nof Europe that had heretofore been brought into print through the\r\npresses of Frankfort or of Leipsic was now transferred to Amsterdam and\r\nLeyden. The theological discussions which became active in Holland,\r\nmore particularly after the time of the Synod of Dort in 1618,\r\nfurthered the work of the printing-presses. The Hollanders were also\r\nshrewd enough to realise the opportunity given to them for bringing\r\ninto print the books which had been prohibited or cancelled in Spain,\r\nin France, or in Italy. With a few exceptions, these books had been\r\nwritten in Latin and the editions printed in Leyden or in Amsterdam\r\nwere, therefore, available for the use of scholarly readers throughout\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nAndrea Schurius writes[149] that he has been told that the Amsterdam\r\npublisher of the _Bibliotheca Fratrum Polonorum_ took special\r\npains to secure the formal prohibition of his work, considering this to\r\nbe the most effective means of bringing it into active sale.\r\n\r\nDuring the 17th century, the press of the Dutch Republic continued this\r\nwork free from restrictions which hampered publishing in all other\r\nStates of Europe. The censorship measures in Holland were restricted to\r\ncertain edicts and regulations issued by the States-General prohibiting\r\nthe printing of libellous material or of works directed against princes\r\nor governments which were allied with the Republic. There is also\r\nan occasional edict against the circulation of publications classed\r\nas “irreligious” or “obscene.” The machinery for the enforcement of\r\nthese regulations appears, however, to have been very inconsiderable;\r\nand there is no record of any general inspection for the purpose of\r\ncensorship of the productions of the printing-press. Among the earlier\r\nnoteworthy publications of the Elzevirs were certain books that could\r\nnot at that time easily have come into print elsewhere, such as _The\r\nSystem of the Universe_ by Galileo and the _Defensio Populi Anglicani_\r\nof Milton. Galileo, writing in 1638, gave testimony to the excellence\r\nof the work done for him by his Dutch publishers. The list of scholars\r\nunder censorship either ecclesiastical or political in their persons or\r\nin their books who had been exiled from their own countries and whose\r\nnames are brought together on the catalogues of the Elzevir house is\r\na long one. We may mention, in addition to Galileo, Scaliger, Hobbes,\r\nPascal, Descartes, More, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Roman, Spanish, and French Indexes served as guides to the Dutch\r\nprinters for the selection of books likely to prove of interest\r\nand to secure circulation. In not a few instances, the scholarly\r\nwriters themselves who had been banished from Spain or from France\r\nin connection with their so-called heretical teachings, or who,\r\nirrespective of banishment, had decided that they could carry on\r\ntheir work to better advantage in a territory which was outside of\r\nthe control of the Catholic Church, had taken up their residence in\r\nHolland. The influx of these scholars made Holland for a century or\r\nmore the centre of scholarly activity in Europe and gave to the Dutch\r\npublishers, in the use of these scholarly pens for original work and\r\nfor editorial work, an enormous advantage. The ethics of publishing\r\nwere at this time not recognised or certainly at least not recognised\r\noutside of national boundaries. The Dutch publishers were quite ready,\r\ntherefore, in the case even of books which had not been prohibited\r\nin the country of origin, to utilise texts that had been edited or\r\nshaped by competitors in Venice, in Paris, or in Frankfort, for the\r\nproduction of competing editions. The printers of Holland secured for\r\nthemselves a final advantage in developing after 1525 a better standard\r\nof typography, both for accuracy and for beauty, than had as yet been\r\nknown in Europe excepting with certain of the issues of Aldus and of\r\nFroben. The preëminence obtained under these several influences by the\r\nprinters of Holland continued until the middle of the 18th century.\r\n\r\n\r\n=8. England.=--The work of printing in England began with Caxton,\r\nin 1476. His catalogue speaks of his books as being “printed in the\r\nAbbey of Westminster.” His presses were as a fact placed in the\r\nalmonry, a space within the Abbey precincts. Sir Thomas More has\r\nshown why Caxton could not venture to print a Bible in the vernacular,\r\nalthough the people would have greedily bought the Wyclif translation.\r\nWyclif’s translation was interdicted and More says: “On account of the\r\npenalties ordered by Archbishop Arundel’s constitution, though the old\r\ntranslations that were before Wyclif’s days remained lawful and were in\r\nsome folks’ hands, yet he thought no printer would likely be so hot to\r\nput any Bible in print at his own charge, and then hang upon a doubtful\r\ntrial whether the first copy of his translation was made before\r\nWyclif’s days or since. For if it were made since Wyclif, it must be\r\napproved before the printing.” This was a dilemma that Caxton was too\r\nprudent to encounter.[150]\r\n\r\nIn England, during the first half of the century, the printers,\r\nwhile having various other difficulties to contend with, such as\r\nlack of communication with a public, the small extent of the public\r\nthat was ready to be interested in the printed book, and the serious\r\ninterference that was caused to all trade by the events of the Civil\r\nWar, were practically free from any burdens of censorship. Even if\r\nthe ecclesiastics in England had been in a position to make their\r\ncensorship troublesome, they would have had small occasion for\r\ninterference with the first literary undertakings of the English\r\nprinters. The lists included hardly any works having to do with\r\ntheology, religion, or controversial subjects of any kind. Caxton and\r\nhis immediate successors realised that at this period the interest\r\nof English readers could be depended upon much more safely for books\r\nof romance and for chronicles. It was nearly a century after the\r\nintroduction of printing into England before any attempt was made to\r\nproduce English editions of the Scriptures. It was in Germany that\r\nduring this period the attention of the printers was given largely to\r\nthe production of Bibles, theological treatises, and controversial\r\ntracts. The lists of the printers of France were devoted mainly to\r\nclassics, with some titles under the headings of romance and poetry,\r\nwhile in Italy the earlier lists were made up chiefly of classics and\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nThe Stationers’ Company received its charter by royal decree in 1566,\r\ntwo years after the marriage of Queen Mary (to Philip of Spain). It\r\nconstituted an organisation of the publishing and printing trade\r\nof London which assumed to represent the publishing interests of\r\nthe country. The basis of the authority of the Stationers’ Company\r\nwas the theory that all printing was the prerogative of the king.\r\nThe Stationers’ Company had, under its charter, summary rights of\r\nsearch, seizure, and imprisonment, and these powers were confirmed\r\nor renewed by the licensing acts. It seems probable that the purpose\r\nof the institution of the Company was not so much the furthering of\r\nthe business of book-production, as the organisation of this business\r\nin such shape that it could be reached effectively and promptly by\r\nthe censorship authorities of the Crown. No question appears to have\r\narisen in England in regard to any conflicting authority on the part\r\nof the Church to control such censorship. The Crown utilised the\r\nservices of bishops and of other ecclesiastics for the examination of\r\nworks in the division of theology which came under the suspicion of\r\nheresy. The selection of the examiners and the decision concerning the\r\ndisposition of the books so examined was reserved, however, for the\r\ndirect action of the Crown or of the representatives of the Crown.\r\nSuch censorship as came into action in England proved to be more\r\nimportant in connection with political literature than with works on\r\nreligion or theology. In 1644, the Long Parliament enacted certain\r\nregulations for the control of printing which provided that “No book,\r\npamphlet, or paper shall be henceforth printed unless the same be first\r\napproved and licensed by censors that shall be thereto appointed.”\r\nMilton had been a persistent opponent of the policy of censorship and\r\nof licensing, and one result of the enactment was the publication of\r\nthe famous _Areopagitica_, an oration in the form of a pamphlet, which\r\npresented with fierce eloquence a protest against the whole theory\r\nof the exercise by Government licensers of a supervision and control\r\nof literature, or of the delegation of such control to a commercial\r\ncompany (the Stationers’ Company) which was the creation of Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n=9. Oxford. Index Generalis. James. 1627.=--In 1627, Thomas James,\r\nthe librarian of the Bodleian Library in Oxford, brought into print,\r\nunder the title of an _Index Generalis_, a summary or catalogue\r\nwhich had been made up from the Church Indexes that had thus far come\r\ninto print and of which James had been able to secure copies. It was\r\nhis purpose to present in this general catalogue the titles of the\r\nmore important of the books condemned under the censorship of the\r\nChurch, copies of which books it was, as he pointed out, important to\r\nsecure for the Bodleian collection. The so-called James Index came to\r\nbe a working guide for book-buyers and its publication had a direct\r\neffect upon the circulation in England of the books specified. It has,\r\ntherefore, seemed in order to make reference to it in this chapter on\r\nthe influence of censorship on the book-trade of England.\r\n\r\nThis catalogue of James was utilised during the succeeding years\r\nby English scholars generally, as a convenient guide to the\r\nliterature condemned by the Church and which on the very ground of\r\nits condemnation might be assumed to possess interest and value\r\nfor scholars who were not troubled by the dread of ecclesiastical\r\npenalties. The recommendation of James that copies of these works\r\nshould be secured for the Bodleian has been carried out quite\r\neffectively. The copy of the James Index which has been preserved for\r\nthe reference library of the Bodleian has been checked by successive\r\nlibrarians as copies of the books recommended have been secured and\r\nthe list is now very nearly complete. The copies secured for the\r\nBodleian represent in large part editions printed in Holland; as\r\nbefore pointed out, the publishers of Amsterdam, Leyden, and Utrecht\r\nhad, from the date of publication in 1546 of the Index of Louvain,\r\ninterested themselves in bringing promptly into print works condemned\r\nby Roman authorities and in furthering the distribution of these books\r\nthroughout Europe.\r\n\r\nThe full title of James’s Index reads as follows: _Index Generalis\r\nLibrorum Prohibitorum a Pontificiis; una cum editionibus expurgatis\r\nvel expurgandis juxta serium literarum et triplicem classem. In usum\r\nBibliothecæ Bodleianæ et Curatoribus ejusdem specialiter designatus.\r\nPer Tho. James, S. Theol. D. Coll. B. Mariæ. Winton. In Oxon. Vulgo.\r\nNovi dicti quondam Socium Oxonæ Excudebat Gulielmus Turner. An. D.\r\n1627._\r\n\r\nI add a rendering of his preface (the original of which, according\r\nto the custom of the time, is in Latin) which is interesting as\r\nindicating the attitude of the Protestant scholar of the day towards\r\nthe censorship of Rome. James includes in the volume of his Index an\r\nannouncement (addressed to students of theology) of another work\r\nthat he had in preparation which he entitles _A Universal Index of\r\nthe Sacred Fathers of the Church_. He speaks of having published a\r\nsample of this and goes on to say,\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bull appended to the oath at the Council of Trent.--“I\r\nwill never accept or interpret Holy Scripture except according to the\r\nunanimous opinion of the Fathers.”]\r\n\r\n   “If my friends tell me that this sample which I have published\r\n   is not displeasing to them, there will shortly after follow\r\n   the other books of Scripture, if not in their own order, at\r\n   least in a series which has the support of other authorities.\r\n   My method of procedure will be as follows: The text before us\r\n   will be the Vulgate, and no one who has read any of the works\r\n   of Cyprian or Tertullian or of the other ancient Fathers of the\r\n   Church, has ventured to say that this text is Hieronymian, and\r\n   thus the various readings which do not agree with this Vulgate\r\n   edition will be added, and the passages which have been disputed\r\n   by Bellarmin and his school (of which there are more in this\r\n   fifth chapter than in any other) carefully noted in the margin.\r\n   By these means, the younger students to whom God has given the\r\n   necessary leisure and inclination, may see whether the Fathers\r\n   take the side of the Pontifical writers with their shrill\r\n   unseemly clamour, or are ranged under our banners: for a careful\r\n   inspection of the Company here drawn up will support opinions\r\n   of the Eastern as well as the Western Churches one after\r\n   another,--a support which is claimed falsely by the Papists,\r\n   in direct opposition to the rules laid down by the Council of\r\n   Trent, as they would see if they would but face the facts.\r\n\r\n   “If the opinion of those who have declared that these Books\r\n   ought not to be published, or ought to be suppressed, wins\r\n   the day, I shall not fall claiming to have championed in the\r\n   struggle the fortunes of the Church or any great issue. No! but\r\n   relying on conscience and on the conviction that I must promote\r\n   the cause of God to the best of my poor ability, I shall\r\n   preserve my writings of whatsoever sort in my own house under my\r\n   own roof; with the hope that if I can but present a willing and\r\n   ready spirit I shall be not unworthy to serve the world, even\r\n   though opportunities and resources fail; for has not the Poet\r\n   said,\r\n\r\n                    ‘In magnis est voluisse satis.’\r\n\r\n   “In everything I have tried to follow the counsel of S.\r\n   Paul,--neglecting my own conscience, taking no care for my\r\n   bodily health, not seeking your money, but yourselves, not\r\n   trying to profit myself but to benefit the world.\r\n\r\n   “Finally, that there be no mistake as to the editions which I\r\n   have used in the compilation, I have appended the following\r\n   Index. Lest you experience difficulty in perusing it or strike\r\n   upon the rock which has proved fatal to others, I would have\r\n   you remember (being desirous of removing the obstacle which has\r\n   long troubled many readers) that I have devised a way by which\r\n   all future Editions may be referred to my pages, thus saving\r\n   readers the expense and trouble of buying Edition after Edition.\r\n   With these words of instruction, learned Reader, I would bid you\r\n   farewell. May God direct and preserve us and our studies to the\r\n   glory of His name and to the advancement of His Church.\r\n\r\n   “For the State and the Catholic Church of God these labours.\r\n\r\n                                                  TH. JAMES, D.D.\r\n\r\n   “OXFORD, 1627.”\r\n\r\nThe preface to the Index itself reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                     TO BE NOTED IN THIS CATALOGUE\r\n\r\n   “First, as regards the numerals 1, 2, 3, occurring throughout\r\n   the book.\r\n\r\n   “1. Denotes condemned authors, that is, authors whose religious\r\n   opinions are orthodox and pious, but whose books are prohibited.\r\n\r\n   “2. Denotes pontifical authors, in whose case caution or\r\n   expurgation is prescribed.\r\n\r\n   “3. Denotes works of doubtful authorship which are prohibited.\r\n\r\n“But it must be understood that the inquisitors (if one may say so)\r\nmade a rather imperfect classification under these heads. For the\r\nauthors Aventinus, Erasmus, Palingenius, Bruciolus, etc., were placed\r\nin the first class, whereas they belong rightly in the second; and\r\non the other hand, Adolphus Metkerchus, Lavinus Lemnius, and others,\r\nwho ought to be in the first class, are placed in the second. And the\r\nthird class, which should consist of doubtful works, contains a good\r\nmany known authors whose names and surnames are clear as day to any\r\none looking at the title-pages with one eye. This appears plainly, for\r\nexample, in the case of two books, _Bello Papali_, and another of which\r\nthe title is, _Beliae, sive consolatio peccatorum_.\r\n\r\n“Secondly, it ought to be clear to everybody that books prohibited\r\nby the _pontificii_ (_i. e._ the Congregation of the Index, acting\r\nas the representatives of the Pope) ought to be sought with the more\r\nzeal and read with the greater avidity. For what the papists prohibit,\r\nGod grants for our use and benefit, and the memory of those condemned\r\nby our adversaries is and should be blessed, since their names are\r\ndoubtless inscribed in the Book of Life.\r\n\r\n“Thirdly, a star(*) indicates editions or authors hitherto contained in\r\nthe _Bibliotheca Oxoniensis_, which is to be set down as our gain since\r\nwe need take no further trouble to make them known.\r\n\r\n“Fourthly, the Greek letter denotes authors of the second class (almost\r\nall _pontificii_) who (unless they are emended and expurgated as the\r\nIndexes direct) set forth more clearly than the noonday sun the very\r\ndoctrine of the Protestants, so that the _pontificii_ do not venture\r\neven to mutter against it. This is doubtless the work of God’s finger\r\nand of the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, who armed Midianite against\r\nMidianite, to their mutual slaughter.\r\n\r\n“Fifthly, we have arranged all authors of whatever class in strict\r\nalphabetical order. Their names cannot be found so easily in the\r\n_Sandovillian_ or _Roman Index_, in comparison with which other Indexes\r\nare rubbish.\r\n\r\n“Sixthly, in this alphabetical revision are included books, written\r\nwhether in Latin or in French, Italian or Spanish, chiefly on religious\r\nsubjects, by men who were in their own day not subject to condemnation\r\nat the hands of either God or men, but who, if they were now alive,\r\ncould hardly, or not at all, escape the Inquisition and damnation to\r\nthe shades of deeper hell. Moreover (to speak more plainly and to make\r\nthe thing clear by examples taken from this book) the _pontificii_\r\nare so far from being consistent that books hitherto praised and\r\napproved by worthy men are now transformed into prohibited books of the\r\nsecond or third class. In this way was treated even the _Evangelium\r\nRomanum prout a Clementis octavi manu Jacobs Davis Episcopo traditum\r\nest_; for after the book had (if the stories may be believed) worked\r\nmiracles on the return of Perron to France, it was not only left\r\nneglected, but the possession of a copy was prohibited under penalty of\r\nexcommunication.[151] Capucinus, inquisitor in the diocese of Naples,\r\nhas his doubts about the Index of Quirogus (Madrid, 4VO, 1584), and\r\nfor this reason he incurs censure in the Sandovillian Index, p. 365\r\n(consult our catalogue) and the _Enchiridion Ecclesiasticum_, Ven.,\r\n1588 (see our catalogue) is by no means to be read unless _corrigatur_.\r\nIn the same way, Gabriel Pentherbeus’ book on The Destruction of Evil\r\nBooks is not always free from the censure of others. What need of\r\nmore examples? The Defence against the Reformers, according to the\r\nprinciples of S. Francis, S.D.N., by Manfred (and, good God, what a\r\nman) is altogether prohibited, unless I have overlooked something. If\r\nso many and such men do not escape the hands, or rather the claws of\r\ntheir own party, who can guarantee safety to a book composed by any\r\nauthor whatever? Not Aesculapius himself, their God, their lord Pope,\r\nventured to promise this, since Clement VIII changed the books of his\r\npredecessor, Sixtus V, with no consideration for the industry involved,\r\non the ground of typographical errors, a most glorious lie. There are\r\nmany more cases of this sort worthy of notice, but it has seemed best\r\nto mention but these few facts at present. Let the rest be left in the\r\nhands of the intelligent reader, or postponed to another time.\r\n\r\n“Finally, it must be carefully noted that the censures sometimes recoil\r\nupon the censors themselves, for no law is juster than that the very\r\ninquisitors should be revised, corrected, and altered, under the rod.\r\nThe complete works of Beatus Arias Montanus for one were most severely\r\ncastigated by the first inquisitors and expurgators. This is done\r\n(strange but true) on page 55 of the Index Sandovilliano and on page 39\r\nof the Roman Index, to say nothing of the Indexes named above. Are more\r\ninstances wanted?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n              EXAMPLES OF CENSORSHIP OF THE STAGE IN THE\r\n                           SIXTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n    1. In Italy\r\n    2. In Spain\r\n    3. In France\r\n\r\n\r\nThe scope and plan of this treatise do not permit any general\r\nconsideration of so complex a subject as the censorship of the stage.\r\nIn the present chapter, I am submitting merely certain examples of\r\nattempts at such censorship in Italy, Spain, and France in the 16th\r\ncentury, which it may be interesting to compare with the supervision\r\nthat was being exercised in these countries at the same time over the\r\nproduction and distribution of literature.\r\n\r\n\r\n=1. The Theatre in Italy, 16th Century.=--The action taken in regard\r\nto the censorship of the stage varied materially in the different\r\nlocalities. St. Charles Borromeo prohibited in Florence, in 1565,\r\ntheatrical performances during the time of religious fêtes. Later, he\r\nsecured the suppression altogether of the presentation of the drama of\r\nthe Passion. Gregory XIII, as the result of an appeal made to him by\r\nSt. Charles, prohibited dramatic performances in Rome on holy days. The\r\ninfluence of the saint secured similar action in Verona and in Bologna,\r\nand, in 1577, Venice banished the comedians altogether.\r\n\r\nThe Church as a whole, however, avoided being drawn into the\r\nconsideration of the control of the drama; it made absolute prohibition\r\nof but two things: the presentation on the stage of ecclesiastical\r\ndress and the use of female actors.[152]\r\n\r\nThe Jesuit Ottonelli, writing in 1640, condemns “immodest” dramatic\r\nrepresentations, of which he demands the complete suppression. He\r\ncontends that there should be on the stage no scenes of love between a\r\nman and a woman left alone. He is willing to concede the communication,\r\nin connection with a proposition of marriage, by the father of the\r\nlover to the father of the girl, of the sentiments of the young\r\nman.[153]\r\n\r\n\r\n=2. The Theatre in Spain.=--In Spain and in Italy the clergy\r\nundertook during the 16th century to repress or to restrict the license\r\nof the stage, and in Spain, at least, the clerical control of the drama\r\nwas complete. The seven centuries of contest against the Moors had,\r\namong other results, served to associate indissolubly the Catholic\r\nfaith with the cause of patriotism and nationality, and with the daily\r\nlife of the people; and yet in Spain a large respect and an ardent\r\ndevotion for the Church were not felt to be incompatible with a large\r\nindecency on the stage.\r\n\r\nIn Spain, the Inquisition, in place of being detested as in France, or\r\ndreaded as in Italy, was really a popular institution. Lope de Vega,\r\nwho entered the priesthood after the birth of two illegitimate children\r\nwhich had come to him during his second widowhood, displayed at the\r\nhead of his most indecent comedies his title of “Familiar of the Sacred\r\nOffice.” His plays present alternate examples of passages of real\r\npiety and of verses the most obscene.\r\n\r\nIn 1548, however, as a result of a petition of the Cortes to Charles V,\r\nvigorous measures were taken against indecent performances; and between\r\n1587 and 1600, such effective destruction was made by the clerical\r\ncommissioners of dramatic productions that of a series of forty-three\r\nvolumes, there remained copies of but ten.[154]\r\n\r\n\r\n=3. The Theatre in France, 16th Century.=--The French Church\r\nof the 16th century did not manifest antagonism to the stage. The\r\nedict of 1548, which, for the purpose of protecting religion against\r\nindignities, ordered that dramatic performances should be restricted\r\nto subjects that were “profane, decent, and free from scandal,”\r\nemanated not from the divines, but from the Parliament of Paris.\r\nThe Church councils of the provinces restricted their interference\r\nto the prohibition of the use for such performances of consecrated\r\nbuildings.[155]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n               THE LITERARY POLICY OF THE MODERN CHURCH\r\n\r\n    1.

The Indexes of Leo XIII, 1881–1900.=\r\n\r\nRome, 1881, 1884, 1896.--_Index Librorum Prohibitorum sanctissimi\r\nDomini nostri Leonis XIII, Pont. Max.

Romae, Typis\r\nVaticanis, 1900._\r\n\r\nThe two Indexes issued by Leo XIII, the first compiled in 1881 and\r\nreprinted in 1884 and 1896 with supplements, and the second in 1900,\r\nconstitute at the date of this writing (December, 1906) the latest\r\nexpression of the censorship policy of the Church of Rome. It remains\r\nto be seen whether Pius X (who is not credited with any such measure\r\nof literary interests as characterised his scholarly predecessor)\r\nwill undertake the production of any addition to the long series\r\nof Roman prohibitory Indexes. The first of the two Indexes of Leo\r\nis, bibliographically speaking, a fairly creditable piece of work.\r\nThe titles are, with few exceptions, correctly presented, and in\r\nthis respect it makes a noteworthy exception to all the preceding\r\nRoman Indexes, excepting only that of Benedict, issued in 1758. Its\r\ntypography is, however, undignified. The volume contains in all about\r\n6800 entries. The number of separate works considered is, however, very\r\nmuch smaller, as in a large number of instances each book is entered\r\ntwice in the alphabetical list, once under its own title, and again\r\nunder the name of the author.\r\n\r\nThe volume of 1896 presents as front matter:\r\n\r\n       I.  The Preface (signed by Cajetanus Amatus)\r\n             to the Index of Benedict                         1758\r\n      II.  The Address to the Reader, signed by Saccheri\r\n     III.

Observations on the Rules from the Index of\r\n             Alexander VII                                    1664\r\n      VI.  The Instruction of Clement VIII\r\n     VII.  The Constitution of Benedict XIV\r\n    VIII.  The Decree _de libris prohibitis_, from the Index\r\n             of Benedict                                      1758\r\n      IX.

The _Monitum_ of the Congregation of the Index     1836\r\n     XII.  The Constitution of Pius IX                        1869\r\n    XIII.  The Declaration of Pius IX (in regard to the\r\n             dogma of the Immaculate Conception)              1854\r\n\r\nThe Index of 1900 is very attractively printed, and is a credit to\r\nthe work of the papal printing-office. It is the first of the Roman\r\nissues that can be so described. This second Index repeats, with a few\r\nomissions, the lists of the volumes of 1896, with the addition of\r\ncertain titles selected from the publications of the intervening four\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe prefatory matter of the volume of 1900 is made up as follows:\r\n\r\n      I. The Papal Brief, which bears the signature of Cardinal Macchi.\r\n     II. A Preface, with the signature of Esser, Secretary to the\r\n           Congregation.\r\n    III. The Constitution of Leo XII.\r\n     IV. The _Decreta Generalia_.\r\n      V. The Constitution of Benedict.\r\n\r\nI have thought it in order to present the full text of the first four\r\nof these documents as fairly representative of the literary policy of\r\nthe Church at the close of the 19th century.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           BRIEF OF LEO XIII\r\n\r\n   “The Roman pontiffs, to whom, in the person of S. Peter the\r\n   chief of the Apostles, that great duty was committed of feeding\r\n   the universal flock of Christ, have all been constant in\r\n   preserving whole and inviolate the most precious deposit of the\r\n   Faith, and in nourishing the Christian peoples of the world with\r\n   the food of sound doctrine. Hence the fervent and provident\r\n   care continually taken by them that, as good grain from tares,\r\n   so sound and excellent books may be separated from the alloyed,\r\n   the apocryphal, and the hurtful, lest Christian men, by using\r\n   them incautiously or daringly, may injure the integrity of their\r\n   faith and morals. Under this head, the pontiffs themselves or\r\n   the councils have been ever careful to provide remedies suitable\r\n   to the evils, changing these to suit the changes of time. When\r\n   the invention, in the 15th century, of the new art of printing\r\n   caused a great increase in the number of books and also a\r\n   great spread of the pest of evil heresies, it was everywhere\r\n   deemed necessary to take severe notice of evil writings, both to\r\n   forestall danger and to repair evil already done. Therefore the\r\n   Fathers of the Council of Trent, to whom our predecessor Pius\r\n   IV had entrusted the matter, deemed that the great contagion of\r\n   heretical books, or of books suspected of the crime of heresy,\r\n   or of books hurtful to piety and morals, should be attacked in\r\n   two ways: First, the scholars and theologians, chosen for this\r\n   purpose by the authority of the same synod, made certain general\r\n   rules so that it might be easier to decide of what books in\r\n   general the faithful should beware; and secondly, they compiled\r\n   an accurate and absolute exposition or Index of books of\r\n   improper contents. When the synod adjourned, by its own decree,\r\n   this Index, with the rules above mentioned, was shown to our\r\n   predecessor, Pius IV, that it might, before publication, receive\r\n   the support of the Apostolic sanction. The pontiff approved it\r\n   after it had been worked over again with great diligence, and\r\n   ordered its observance by all.\r\n\r\n   “In the nature of the case, his Index required additions as\r\n   in the course of time new wicked and hurtful books appeared,\r\n   and every one knows that the Apostolic Chair has attended to\r\n   this again and again with zealous care. Thus Clement VIII and\r\n   later Alexander VII and Benedict XIV, our predecessors, by the\r\n   specification of those books which the popes had proscribed, by\r\n   Apostolic letters, by the Roman Congregations, and chiefly by\r\n   the Congregations of the Inquisition and the Index, revised and\r\n   reshaped the Index proper so that it constituted practically a\r\n   new compilation. Since (the issue of Benedict) there has been\r\n   a long interval, almost a hundred and forty years, and the\r\n   conditions seemed to call for something more comprehensive and\r\n   more efficient for the present needs....\r\n\r\n                              “(Signed),\r\n\r\n                                          “ALOIS. CARD. MACCHI.\r\n\r\n    “ROME, Sept. 17, 1900.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                               “PREFACE\r\n\r\n   “Behold, worthy reader, a new Index of the prohibited books,\r\n   revised and published with the greatest care, by direction of\r\n   His Holiness Leo XIII, P. M.; together with a syllabus of books\r\n   to be avoided, there are published also the Constitutions of\r\n   the Apostolic Chair by which the examination and proscription\r\n   of bad books are at present governed: viz.: the Constitution\r\n   ‘of Offices and Duties,’ promulgated by Leo, Jan. 25, 1897, and\r\n   the Constitution ‘_Solicita ac Provida_’ by which Benedict\r\n   XIV, on July 9, 1753, established clear and firm rules for the\r\n   use of the Roman and universal Inquisition, and also of the Holy\r\n   Congregation of the Index, in examining and judging books.\r\n\r\n   “As to the Constitution of Benedict XIV, it does not apply so\r\n   much to the faithful in general as to those who are entrusted by\r\n   the Holy See with the task of examining books. The Constitution\r\n   of the present Pope has another object, since, revoking the\r\n   rules of the holy Synod of Trent, ‘it sets forth certain new\r\n   general Decretals, which are to be obeyed religiously by\r\n   Catholics everywhere.’\r\n\r\n   Furthermore, these general Decretals and the Index have this in\r\n   common, that both exist for the purpose of teaching what books\r\n   to avoid reading and owning. The Decretals, however, serve this\r\n   end in one way, the Index in another. For the Decretals prohibit\r\n   the greatest possible number, indeed almost all, of noxious and\r\n   tainted books, the reading of which is strongly forbidden by\r\n   the natural law itself; while the Index reviews and notes but a\r\n   small part of these. By the Decretals, _genera_ and classes\r\n   only of bad books are proscribed; by the Index, individual\r\n   books, each with its title and even the author’s name. Hence it\r\n   is plain how greatly they err who suppose the whole question\r\n   of improper books to be decided by the Index alone, as though\r\n   of the innumerable perverse and pernicious books which have\r\n   appeared in the course of centuries, those only are prohibited\r\n   which have been condemned by special decrees and noticed in\r\n   the catalogue of prohibited books. In fact, any given book can\r\n   only be safely declared lawful reading when these two conditions\r\n   are satisfied: it must not occur in the Index nor be contained\r\n   in any of those classes which are as a whole reprobated and\r\n   condemned by the Decretals.\r\n\r\n   “It remains to consider what the character of the Index is\r\n   and what the object was in planning and compiling it. For a\r\n   catalogue of prohibited books does not go as far as to note\r\n   each and every bad book. Obviously this would not be done, nor,\r\n   if the principle of the Decretals be grasped, does it appear\r\n   necessary. There must, therefore, be some special reason why the\r\n   Roman Congregations black-list by special decree a book already\r\n   included in those classes noted by the Decretals. This reason\r\n   is furnished in most cases by denunciations, from a bishop or\r\n   other of the persons specified in _Const. Off. ac Mun._,\r\n   vv. 27, 28, 29, recommending a given book to the Holy See for\r\n   examination as destructive or dangerous. Following this clue,\r\n   and not of set purpose choosing the worst among all the books in\r\n   existence, the Holy See is very often led to examine other books\r\n   not included by the Decretals. Therefore, it would be vain to\r\n   seek in the Index either all noxious and wicked books or those\r\n   distinguished as it were for wickedness in any department, or\r\n   to demand that the books in the Index be dealt with in a fixed\r\n   order based on either the argument or the matter. The only basis\r\n   of the Index is then this, that it notes those works which for\r\n   any reason have been prohibited by special decree during the\r\n   last three centuries, whether by popes in Apostolic letters or\r\n   by Roman Congregations, and especially the Congregation of the\r\n   Index, so that neither oblivion nor ignorance may obscure the\r\n   dangerous character of their contents.\r\n\r\n   “A few words are needed to explain the principle of the new\r\n   edition and its chief points of difference from the earlier\r\n   ones. The intention of the Pope in ordering a thorough revision\r\n   of the Index was not only to temper the severity of the old\r\n   rules but also, on behalf of the maternal kindness of the\r\n   Church, to accommodate the whole spirit of the Index to the\r\n   times. In the actual compilation of the list of prohibited books\r\n   some material modification has been shown and the number of\r\n   books formerly prohibited has been diminished. This can be seen\r\n   in the first Decretal, by which all books prohibited before the\r\n   year 1600 are declared to be henceforth expunged from the Index,\r\n   although they are to be considered as much condemned to-day as\r\n   they ever were, with the exception of those permitted by the\r\n   new Decretal. Hence in the case of condemned authors hitherto\r\n   described in Class I, all of whose works were prohibited, by\r\n   the present Index those of their works are permitted which\r\n   either _ex professo_ do not treat of religion, or, if\r\n   they do treat of it, contain nothing contrary to the Faith,\r\n   unless they happen to have been prohibited by some general or\r\n   special decree. And this mitigation may properly be extended\r\n   to the case of non-Catholic authors whose complete works are\r\n   expressly prohibited in the Index. This prohibition will not\r\n   apply in future to those books which touch the Faith either\r\n   not at all or only incidentally by the way, if these have not\r\n   been noted by any general or special decree. Therefore the old\r\n   distinction between ‘all works’ simply and ‘all works treating\r\n   of religion’ might be cancelled as superfluous. For whenever the\r\n   complete works of an author are prohibited, those works only are\r\n   understood which either treat of religion or are proscribed by\r\n   some general or special decree.\r\n\r\n   “Moreover, certain books, not a few in number, have been dropped\r\n   from the Index, which, although they labour under certain\r\n   defects or have some slight taint, yet have such a reputation\r\n   for learning or such documentary value that their errors or\r\n   views seem to be compensated by their usefulness.\r\n\r\n   “It was also thought best to delete a good many works which\r\n   deal with the Immaculate Conception, soundly, it is true, but\r\n   too intemperately or with some offence to adversaries. Again, a\r\n   number in which domestic controversies and private quarrels were\r\n   agitated with improper acrimony, to the injury of good feeling\r\n   and with hardly any gain to truth; and some which deserved\r\n   prohibition not by defective doctrine nor failure in charity,\r\n   but by the indiscretion of the author in failing to obey the\r\n   public injunction to silence for the sake of extinguishing\r\n   private quarrels. These controversies having become extinct and\r\n   the injunction to silence having been long ago removed, these\r\n   books could be dismissed.\r\n\r\n   “Since certain books, otherwise harmless, had been placed on the\r\n   Index because they contained offices and litanies of the Church\r\n   which were disapproved and published contrary to prohibition,\r\n   it seemed good to expunge these also, since to-day the power is\r\n   entrusted to Ordinaries to publish litanies and prayers of this\r\n   kind for the private use of the faithful.\r\n\r\n   “Certain minor works, frivolous, or absurd or superstitious, and\r\n   such as cite false and apocryphal indulgences, are omitted. For\r\n   superstitions and magic are sufficiently excluded by _Dec._\r\n   12, 13, 16, and 17; while for the elimination of apocryphal\r\n   indulgences, there is at hand for all the authoritative ‘decree\r\n   of the Holy Congregation in charge of Indulgences and Holy\r\n   Relics,’ published by command and authority of the Pope, and the\r\n   decree ‘concerning the discrimination between regular or normal\r\n   indulgences and apocryphal,’ published by the same Congregation\r\n   on the 10th of Aug., 1899.\r\n\r\n   “It happened often that there were placed on the Index works\r\n   of slight bulk, sometimes of only a few pages, which were full\r\n   of venom and danger, but which have been so dispersed by the\r\n   passage of time (as by the wind) that to-day copies are hardly\r\n   to be found. These have not been placed on the new Index. Under\r\n   this head are included a series of pamphlets, for the most part\r\n   scholastic, which were transferred to the Index proper from\r\n   the appendices to the Indexes of Innocent XI and of Clement\r\n   XI. Theses, also, which were prepared for public academic\r\n   discussion, although not free from error and rightly and justly\r\n   placed on the Index on their first appearance, have been thought\r\n   fit for omission, the more as oblivion has long ago blotted\r\n   out most of them. But those prohibited writings, however small\r\n   in compass, which claim any part in the historic evolution of\r\n   Catholic theological doctrine, are for this very cause retained\r\n   in the Index.\r\n\r\n   “All those works were struck off which had been condemned only\r\n   by the edicts of the _Magister Palatii_ early in the 17th\r\n   century, and those in regard to which the Congregation itself\r\n   decreed that they might or should be omitted by the next decree,\r\n   as well as certain old collections of declarations, decisions,\r\n   and interpretations of the Council of the Congregation,\r\n   which this body proscribed by its decree of April 29, 1621.\r\n   For although the decrees in these collections are not to be\r\n   considered authentic simply on the ground of inclusion there,\r\n   the collections are nevertheless believed to be of some value\r\n   to-day. Besides, the making of such collections in future has\r\n   been sufficiently guarded against by _Dec. gen._ 33.\r\n\r\n   “It happened sometimes that the first volume or volumes of\r\n   a work were placed in the Index, the later volumes of which\r\n   followed the publication of the prohibition; or that periodicals\r\n   were proscribed which continued afterwards to be published; also\r\n   that all the works of an author were proscribed, who, after\r\n   the publication of the decree, produced other works. In all\r\n   these cases, the volumes or numbers published after the latest\r\n   special decree, although not mentioned in that special decree,\r\n   are nevertheless held suspicious and are justly presumed to fall\r\n   under the prohibition of some general decree, unless there is\r\n   evidence of the author’s change of heart.\r\n\r\n   “It remains to indicate in a few words, for the readier use of\r\n   the Index, the method used in arranging and describing books.\r\n   In order that the issue of Leo might be more correct than its\r\n   predecessors, and that all corruptions might be eliminated\r\n   which, in the course of so many editions, (some of them prepared\r\n   by private authority) had crept in, much zealous labour has been\r\n   given to the investigation of the records of the Congregation of\r\n   the Index and of the Inquisition, both Roman and general; and of\r\n   libraries in Rome and abroad. Books whose authorship is declared\r\n   in their titles are entered under their titles in alphabetical\r\n   order, the author’s name being subjoined when possible. These\r\n   names are always entered in full, lest the omission of a\r\n   syllable should lead to the confusion of similar ones. Assumed\r\n   or fraudulent names included in titles are treated on the same\r\n   basis as real names.\r\n\r\n   “Italian names prefixed by the syllable _De_, _Del_, _Di_, etc.,\r\n   which appears to be part of the name, always begin with that\r\n   syllable in this catalogue. The same applies to _Van_ etc., in\r\n   Dutch names, and to _Des_, etc., and _St._ in French names; but\r\n   names beginning with the two syllables _De la_ are entered under\r\n   _La_. When the syllable _De_ alone begins a French name, it is\r\n   placed after the name in this catalogue unless the name begins\r\n   with a vowel.[156]...”\r\n\r\nThere follow certain further bibliographical details. The Preface\r\nbears the signature of “Fr. Thomas Esser, Ord. Praed. S. Indicis\r\nCongregationis a Secretis.”\r\n\r\n\r\n             THE CONSTITUTION OF POPE LEO XIII, CONCERNING\r\n                THE PROHIBITION AND CENSORSHIP OF BOOKS\r\n\r\n   “Of the duties and obligations which ought to be most carefully\r\n   and faithfully performed in this Apostolic Office, this is the\r\n   chief and most important matter, namely,--to watch zealously and\r\n   make every effort that the integrity of the faith and morals of\r\n   Christians shall not be impaired. If this were ever necessary,\r\n   it is especially so in this age--when, in the midst of unbounded\r\n   license of character and morals, almost all the teaching which\r\n   Jesus Christ, the Saviour of Mankind, entrusted to the care of\r\n   his Church for the salvation of the human race is attacked, with\r\n   daily criticism and discussion.\r\n\r\n   “In this criticism, our opponents use various and innumerable\r\n   stratagems and artifices for the purpose of causing injury; but\r\n   especially dangerous is the lack of moderation in their writings\r\n   and the influence of these pernicious writings among the people.\r\n   For nothing worse can be imagined for contaminating the minds\r\n   of men, both by making them despise religion and by suggesting\r\n   many incentives to sin. Wherefore the Church, the guardian and\r\n   protector of the integrity of faith and morals, in fear of\r\n   this great evil, long ago came to the conclusion that measures\r\n   must be adopted to guard against the danger. To this end, it\r\n   made continued efforts to prohibit men, as far as practicable,\r\n   from the reading of pernicious books, which are the worst kind\r\n   of poison. Even the very remote age of St. Paul saw an eager\r\n   zeal in this matter. And in like manner, every subsequent\r\n   generation has witnessed the watchful care of the holy Fathers,\r\n   the instructions of the bishops, and the decrees of the Church\r\n   councils.\r\n\r\n   “Especially do the records of literature bear witness to the\r\n   care and diligence shown by the Roman pontiffs to prevent the\r\n   writings of heretics, a constant menace to the community, from\r\n   making their way unnoticed into circulation. The earlier years\r\n   are full of examples of this. Anastasius I condemned by a\r\n   solemn edict the more dangerous writings of Origen; Innocent I\r\n   did the same with all the works of Pelagius, and Leo the Great\r\n   with those of the Manichaeans. There are known to be decretal\r\n   letters about the same matter concerning the acceptance and\r\n   the non-acceptance of certain books. For one of these letters\r\n   Gelasius is responsible. Likewise, in the course of years, the\r\n   decree of the Holy See has condemned the pestilent books of the\r\n   Monothelites, of Abélard, Marsilius of Padua, of Wyclif, and of\r\n   Huss.\r\n\r\n   “But in the 15th century, with the invention of the new art\r\n   of printing, not only were prohibitions made against wicked\r\n   books that had actually appeared, but efforts were also made\r\n   to prevent the publication of any further such books. This\r\n   foresight was demanded for that age not on any trivial grounds,\r\n   but by the necessity for the preservation of the public\r\n   integrity and safety; because an art, most excellent in itself,\r\n   and the source of very great advantages, which had come into\r\n   existence originally for the purpose of propagating Christian\r\n   civilisation, had been speedily perverted by the action of many\r\n   into a powerful instrument of evil. The great and pernicious\r\n   influence of wicked writers had more serious and more rapid\r\n   results because of this very increase in the extent of the\r\n   circulation of literature. Therefore, by a most wise policy,\r\n   both Alexander VI and Leo X, my predecessors, made regulations,\r\n   adapted to the character of the times, to keep publishers in the\r\n   path of duty.\r\n\r\n   “Later, as the evil was recognised as more serious, it became\r\n   necessary to use strict and more strenuous measures to check\r\n   the contagious spread of wicked heresies. To this end, the\r\n   same Leo X, and afterwards Clement VII, positively forbade any\r\n   one to read or to possess the books of Luther. But when, in\r\n   accordance with the calamities of the age, the foul collection\r\n   of dangerous books had increased beyond all bounds and had\r\n   penetrated in every direction, the need of a more far-reaching\r\n   and more immediate remedy was recognised. This remedy was first\r\n   opportunely suggested by our predecessor Paul IV, namely, the\r\n   publication of a list of writers and books, from the perusal of\r\n   which the faithful were to abstain. Not long afterwards, the\r\n   Fathers of the Synod of Trent took further measures for checking\r\n   the increasing license of writing and of reading. In accordance\r\n   with their wish and instructions, directors and theologians\r\n   chosen for this purpose took great pains not only in amplifying\r\n   and perfecting the Index which Paul IV had published, but also\r\n   in framing rules to be observed in the publishing, reading, and\r\n   possessing of books. To these rules, Pius IV added the weight of\r\n   the Apostolic authority.\r\n\r\n   “But the needs of the public welfare, which in the beginning\r\n   had caused to be framed the Rules of Trent, promulgated from\r\n   the council, came in later years to call for further action.\r\n   Therefore, the Roman pontiffs, and especially Clement VIII,\r\n   Alexander VII, and Benedict XIV, with full understanding of the\r\n   requirements and with thoughtful discretion, framed further\r\n   decrees to explain these rules and to adapt their instruction to\r\n   the later generations.\r\n\r\n   “This record shows plainly that the Roman pontiffs have always\r\n   taken exceptional pains to protect human society from errors of\r\n   opinion and from influences inimical to morality, and to combat\r\n   those causes of disaster and ruin to the community which are\r\n   engendered and distributed from pernicious literature. Good\r\n   results attended this action as long as, in the administration\r\n   of public affairs, the Divine law had control of the directing\r\n   and the prohibiting, and as long as the temporal Rulers of\r\n   States were in accord with the sacred Authority.\r\n\r\n   “As to what followed, no one is ignorant. When, in the progress\r\n   of the ages, the conditions of society had gradually changed,\r\n   the Church modified with discretion the application of its\r\n   authority, because, with full understanding of the character\r\n   of the times, it saw that these regulations were of assistance\r\n   and service for the guidance of mankind. Several of the rules\r\n   of the Index, which appeared no longer to be pertinent, were\r\n   either abolished by decree, or the books therein forbidden\r\n   were permitted under conditions and with wise judgment on the\r\n   ground of the increasing importance of antiquarian researches.\r\n   Of more recent occurrence is the action of Pius IX instructing\r\n   the archbishops and bishops to modify materially the strictures\r\n   of Rule V. In addition, in view of the approaching important\r\n   Vatican Council, Pius IX confided to a group of learned men\r\n   the task of making a fresh examination of all the rules of\r\n   the Index with instructions to report as to what action might\r\n   be necessary in regard to them. They unanimously agreed that\r\n   certain changes ought to be made. The majority of the Fathers\r\n   frankly avowed that they were of the same opinion and they\r\n   submitted to the council a similar recommendation. There are\r\n   extant letters concerning this matter from the bishops of\r\n   France, whose opinion was unanimous as to the necessity for\r\n   immediate action in order that these rules and the entire Index\r\n   should be framed in an entirely different manner, which would\r\n   render the regulations better suited to our age and easier\r\n   to observe. Similar counsel was received from the bishops of\r\n   Germany, who united in recommending that the rules of the Index\r\n   should be submitted to a new examination and revision. A great\r\n   number of the bishops in Italy and in other countries were in\r\n   accord with this conclusion.\r\n\r\n   “If one considers the character of the times, and the condition\r\n   of civil institutions and of popular morals, we must admit that\r\n   these demands are just and reasonable, and are not out of accord\r\n   with the purposes or the material affection of the Holy Church.\r\n   In the rapid development of intellectual activity, there is\r\n   no field of knowledge in which literature is not produced too\r\n   freely, with the result of a daily accumulation of foul and\r\n   of dangerous books. What is still more serious is that this\r\n   great evil is not only connived at by the civil laws, but even\r\n   secures under these a great freedom. As a result, therefore,\r\n   unrestricted license is assured for reading anything whatever,\r\n   and the minds of many are filled with religious doubts.\r\n\r\n   “Concluding, therefore, that we must now take measures to remedy\r\n   these evils, we have decided that there are two things to be\r\n   done in order that there should be a fixed rule of action in\r\n   this class of matter, a rule that should be plain to every one.\r\n   The Index of books forbidden to be read has been gone over again\r\n   with the utmost care and this revised list shall be published as\r\n   soon as it is in readiness. Furthermore, we have directed our\r\n   attention to the rules themselves and have decided, without\r\n   changing their general character, to make them more lenient, in\r\n   order that unless a man be really depraved, he shall not find it\r\n   a difficult matter to obey them. In this we not only follow the\r\n   examples of our predecessors, but we also imitate the zeal of\r\n   the Mother Church, which, with loving zeal, takes pains to spare\r\n   the infirmities of her children.\r\n\r\n   “Therefore, after mature deliberation and after summoning the\r\n   cardinals and a holy council to go over the lists of books, we\r\n   have decided to publish the following general decrees, which are\r\n   made part of this Constitution. The holy council will in the\r\n   future make use of these rules only, and Catholics all over the\r\n   world must obey them scrupulously. We decree that these only\r\n   shall have the authority of law, and we abrogate the ‘Rules’\r\n   published by the order of the very holy Council of Trent, and\r\n   the ‘observations,’ ‘instructions,’ ‘decrees,’ and ‘precepts,’\r\n   and every other statute or law concerning this matter which have\r\n   been made by our predecessors, except only the ‘Constitution’\r\n   of Benedict XIV, which we decree shall remain in force in the\r\n   future as it has done hitherto.”\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL DECREES CONCERNING THE PROHIBITION AND CENSORSHIP OF BOOKS\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE I\r\n\r\nOF THE PROHIBITION OF BOOKS\r\n\r\n\r\nI. OF THE PROHIBITED BOOKS OF APOSTATES, HERETICS, SCHISMATICS, AND\r\nOTHER WRITERS\r\n\r\n   1. All books condemned before the year 1600 by the Sovereign\r\n   Pontiffs, or by Oecumenical Councils, and which are not recorded\r\n   in the new Index, must be considered as condemned in the same\r\n   manner as formerly: with the exception of such as are permitted\r\n   by the present General Decrees.\r\n\r\n   2. The books of apostates, heretics, schismatics, and all\r\n   writers whatsoever, defending heresy or schism, or in any way\r\n   attacking the foundations of religion, are altogether prohibited.\r\n\r\n   3. Moreover, the books of non-Catholics, _ex professo_\r\n   treating of religion, are prohibited, unless they clearly\r\n   contain nothing contrary to Catholic Faith.\r\n\r\n   4. The books of the above-mentioned writers, not treating _ex\r\n   professo_ of religion, but only touching incidentally upon\r\n   the truths of Faith, are not to be considered as prohibited by\r\n   ecclesiastical law, unless proscribed by special decree.\r\n\r\n\r\n      II. OF EDITIONS OF THE ORIGINAL TEXT OF HOLY SCRIPTURE AND\r\n                   OF VERSIONS NOT IN THE VERNACULAR\r\n\r\n   5. Editions of the original text and of the ancient Catholic\r\n   versions of Holy Scripture, as well as those of the Eastern\r\n   Church, if published by non-Catholics, even though apparently\r\n   edited in a faithful and complete manner, are allowed only to\r\n   those engaged in theological and biblical studies, provided\r\n   also that the dogmas of Catholic Faith are not impugned in the\r\n   prolegomena or annotations.\r\n\r\n   6. In the same manner, and under the same conditions, other\r\n   versions of the Holy Bible, whether in Latin, or in any other\r\n   dead language, published by non-Catholics, are permitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n             III. OF VERNACULAR VERSIONS OF HOLY SCRIPTURE\r\n\r\n   7. As it has been clearly shown by experience that, if the Holy\r\n   Bible in the vernacular is generally permitted without any\r\n   distinction, more harm than utility is thereby caused, owing\r\n   to human temerity: all versions in the vernacular, even by\r\n   Catholics, are altogether prohibited, unless approved by the\r\n   Holy See, or published, under the vigilant care of the Bishops,\r\n   with annotations taken from the Fathers of the Church and\r\n   learned Catholic writers.\r\n\r\n   8. All versions of the Holy Bible, in any vernacular language,\r\n   made by non-Catholics, are prohibited; and especially those\r\n   published by the Bible Societies, which have been more than once\r\n   condemned by the Roman Pontiffs, because in them the wise laws\r\n   of the Church concerning the publication of the sacred books are\r\n   entirely disregarded.\r\n\r\n   Nevertheless, these versions are permitted to students of\r\n   theological or biblical science, under the conditions laid down\r\n   above (No. 5).\r\n\r\n\r\n                         IV. OF OBSCENE BOOKS\r\n\r\n   9. Books which professedly treat of, narrate, or teach lewd or\r\n   obscene subjects are entirely prohibited, since care must be\r\n   taken, not only of faith, but also of morals, which are easily\r\n   corrupted by the reading of such books.\r\n\r\n   10. The books of classical authors, whether ancient or modern,\r\n   if disfigured with the same stain of indecency, are, on account\r\n   of the elegance and beauty of their diction, permitted only to\r\n   those who are justified on account of their duty or the function\r\n   of teaching; but on no account may they be placed in the hands\r\n   of, or taught to, boys or youths, unless carefully expurgated.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 V. OF CERTAIN SPECIAL KINDS OF BOOKS\r\n\r\n   11. Those books are condemned which are derogatory to Almighty\r\n   God, or to the Blessed Virgin Mary or the Saints, or to the\r\n   Catholic Church and her worship, or to the Sacraments, or\r\n   to the Holy See. To the same condemnation are subject those\r\n   works in which the idea of the inspiration of Holy Scripture\r\n   is perverted, or its extension too narrowly limited. Those\r\n   books, moreover, are prohibited which professedly revile the\r\n   Ecclesiastical Hierarchy, or the clerical or religious state.\r\n\r\n   12. It is forbidden to publish, read, or keep books in which\r\n   sorcery, divination, magic, the evocation of spirits, and other\r\n   superstitions of this kind are taught or commended.\r\n\r\n   13. Books or other writings which narrate new apparitions,\r\n   revelations, visions, prophecies, miracles, or which introduce\r\n   new devotions, even under the pretext of being private ones, if\r\n   published without the legitimate permission of ecclesiastical\r\n   superiors, are prohibited.\r\n\r\n   14. Those books, moreover, are prohibited which defend as lawful\r\n   duelling, suicide, or divorce; which treat of Freemasonry, or\r\n   other societies of the kind, teaching them to be useful; and not\r\n   injurious to the Church and to Society; and those which defend\r\n   errors proscribed by the Apostolic See.\r\n\r\n\r\n                VI. OF SACRED PICTURES AND INDULGENCES\r\n\r\n   15. Pictures, in any style of printing, of our Lord Jesus\r\n   Christ, the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Angels and Saints, or other\r\n   Servants of God, which are not conformable to the sense and\r\n   decrees of the Church, are entirely forbidden. New pictures,\r\n   whether produced with or without prayers annexed, may not be\r\n   published without permission of ecclesiastical authority.\r\n\r\n   16. It is forbidden to all to give publicity in any way to\r\n   apocryphal indulgences, and to such as have been proscribed or\r\n   revoked by the Apostolic See. Those which have already been\r\n   published must be withdrawn from the hands of the faithful.\r\n\r\n   17. No books of indulgences, or compendiums, pamphlets,\r\n   leaflets, etc., containing grants of indulgences, may be\r\n   published without permission of competent authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n               VII. OF LITURGICAL BOOKS AND PRAYER BOOKS\r\n\r\n   18. In authentic editions of the Missal, Breviary, Ritual,\r\n   Ceremonial of Bishops, Roman Pontifical, and other liturgical\r\n   books approved by the Holy Apostolic See, no one shall presume\r\n   to make any change whatsoever; otherwise such new editions are\r\n   prohibited.\r\n\r\n   19. No Litanies--except the ancient and common Litanies\r\n   contained in the Breviaries, Missals, Pontificals, and Rituals,\r\n   as well as the Litany of Loreto, and the Litany of the Most\r\n   Holy Name of Jesus, already approved by the Holy See--may\r\n   be published without the examination and approbation of the\r\n   Ordinary.\r\n\r\n   20. No one, without license of legitimate authority, may publish\r\n   books or pamphlets of prayers, devotions, or of religious,\r\n   moral, ascetic, or mystic doctrine and instruction, or others of\r\n   like nature, even though apparently conducive to the fostering\r\n   of piety among Christian people; unless issued under license,\r\n   they are to be considered as prohibited.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  VIII. OF NEWSPAPERS AND PERIODICALS\r\n\r\n   21. Newspapers and periodicals which designedly attack religion\r\n   or morality are to be held as prohibited, not only by the\r\n   natural, but also by the ecclesiastical law.\r\n\r\n   Ordinaries shall take care, whenever it be necessary, that\r\n   the faithful shall be warned against the danger and injury of\r\n   reading of this kind.\r\n\r\n   22. No Catholics, particularly ecclesiastics, shall publish\r\n   anything in newspapers or periodicals of this character, unless\r\n   for some just and reasonable cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n          IX. OF PERMISSION TO READ AND KEEP PROHIBITED BOOKS\r\n\r\n   23. Those only shall be allowed to read and keep books\r\n   prohibited, either by special decrees, or by these General\r\n   Decrees, who shall have obtained the necessary permission,\r\n   either from the Apostolic See or from its delegates.\r\n\r\n   24. The Roman Pontiffs have placed the power of granting\r\n   licenses for the reading and keeping of prohibited books in the\r\n   hands of the Sacred Congregation of the Index. Nevertheless the\r\n   same power is enjoyed both by the Supreme Congregation of the\r\n   Holy Office, and by the Sacred Congregation of Propaganda for\r\n   the regions subject to its administration. For the city of Rome\r\n   this power belongs also to the Master of the Sacred Apostolic\r\n   Palace.\r\n\r\n   25. Bishops and other prelates with quasi-episcopal jurisdiction\r\n   may grant such license for individual books, and in urgent cases\r\n   only. But if they have obtained from the Apostolic See a general\r\n   faculty to grant permission to the faithful to read and keep\r\n   prohibited books, they must grant this only with discretion and\r\n   for a just and reasonable cause.\r\n\r\n   26. Those who have obtained Apostolic faculties to read and keep\r\n   prohibited books may not on this account read and keep any books\r\n   whatsoever or periodicals condemned by the local Ordinaries,\r\n   unless by the Apostolic favour express permission be given to\r\n   read and keep books by whomsoever prohibited. And those who have\r\n   obtained permission to read prohibited books must remember that\r\n   they are bound by grave precept to keep books of this kind in\r\n   such a manner that they may not fall into the hands of others.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  X. OF THE DENUNCIATION OF BAD BOOKS\r\n\r\n   27. Although all Catholics, especially the more learned, ought\r\n   to denounce pernicious books either to the Bishops or to the\r\n   Holy See, this duty belongs more especially to Apostolic Nuncios\r\n   and Delegates, local Ordinaries, and Rectors of Universities.\r\n\r\n   28. It is expedient, in denouncing bad books, that not only the\r\n   title of the book be expressed, but also, as far as possible,\r\n   the reasons be explained why the book is considered worthy of\r\n   censure. Those to whom the denunciation is made will remember\r\n   that it is their duty to keep secret the names of the denouncers.\r\n\r\n   29. Ordinaries, even as Delegates of the Apostolic See, must\r\n   be careful to prohibit evil books or other writings published\r\n   or circulated in their dioceses, and to withdraw them from\r\n   the hands of the faithful. Such works and writings should be\r\n   referred by them to the judgment of the Apostolic See as appear\r\n   to require a more careful examination, or concerning which a\r\n   decision of the Supreme Authority may seem desirable in order to\r\n   procure a more salutary effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ARTICLE II\r\n\r\n                      OF THE CENSORSHIP OF BOOKS\r\n\r\n\r\n          I. OF THE PRELATES INTRUSTED WITH THE CENSORSHIP OF\r\n                                 BOOKS\r\n\r\n   30. From what has been laid down above (No. 7), it is\r\n   sufficiently clear what persons have authority to approve or\r\n   permit editions and translations of the Holy Bible.\r\n\r\n   31. No one shall venture to republish books condemned by the\r\n   Apostolic See. If, for a grave and reasonable cause, any\r\n   particular exception appears desirable in this respect, this\r\n   can only be allowed on obtaining beforehand a license from the\r\n   Sacred Congregation of the Index and observing the conditions\r\n   prescribed by it.\r\n\r\n   32. Whatsoever pertains in any way to Causes of Beatification\r\n   and Canonisation of the Servants of God may not be published\r\n   without the approval of the Congregation of Sacred Rites.\r\n\r\n   33. The same must be said of Collections of Decrees of the\r\n   various Roman Congregations: such Collections may not be\r\n   published without first obtaining the license of the authorities\r\n   of each Congregation, and observing the conditions by them\r\n   prescribed.\r\n\r\n   34. Vicars Apostolic and Missionaries Apostolic shall faithfully\r\n   observe the decrees of the Sacred Congregation of Propaganda\r\n   concerning the publication of books.\r\n\r\n   35. The approbation of books, of which the censorship is not\r\n   reserved by the present Decrees either to the Holy See or to the\r\n   Roman Congregations, belongs to the Ordinary of the place where\r\n   they are published.\r\n\r\n   36. Regulars must remember that, in addition to the license of\r\n   the Bishop, they are bound by a decree of the Sacred Council\r\n   of Trent to obtain leave for publishing any work from their\r\n   own Superior. Both permissions must be printed either at the\r\n   beginning or at the end of the book.\r\n\r\n   37. If an author, living in Rome, desires to print a book, not\r\n   in the city of Rome but elsewhere, no other approbation is\r\n   required beyond that of the Cardinal Vicar and the Master of the\r\n   Apostolic Palace.\r\n\r\n\r\n             II. OF THE DUTY OF CENSORS IN THE PRELIMINARY\r\n                         EXAMINATION OF BOOKS\r\n\r\n   38. Bishops, whose duty it is to grant permission for the\r\n   printing of books, shall take care to employ in the examination\r\n   of them men of acknowledged piety and learning, concerning\r\n   whose faith and honesty they may feel sure, and that they will\r\n   show neither favour nor ill-will, but, putting aside all human\r\n   affections, will look only to the glory of God and the welfare\r\n   of the people.\r\n\r\n   39. Censors must understand that, in the matter of various\r\n   opinions and systems, they are bound to judge with a mind\r\n   free from all prejudice, according to the precept of Benedict\r\n   XIV. Therefore they should put away all attachment to their\r\n   particular country, family, school, or institute, and lay\r\n   aside all partisan spirit. They must keep before their eyes\r\n   nothing but the dogmas of Holy Church, and the common Catholic\r\n   doctrine, as contained in the Decrees of General Councils, the\r\n   Constitutions of the Roman Pontiffs, and the unanimous teaching\r\n   of the Doctors of the Church.\r\n\r\n   40. If after this examination, no objection appears to the\r\n   publication of the book, the Ordinary shall grant to the author,\r\n   in writing and without any fee whatsoever, a license to publish,\r\n   which shall be printed either at the beginning or at the end of\r\n   the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n            III. OF THE BOOKS TO BE SUBMITTED TO CENSORSHIP\r\n\r\n   41. All the faithful are bound to submit to preliminary\r\n   ecclesiastical censorship at least those books which treat\r\n   of Holy Scripture, Sacred Theology, Ecclesiastical History,\r\n   Canon Law, Natural Theology, Ethics, and other religious or\r\n   moral subjects of this character; and in general all writings\r\n   specially concerned with religion and morality.\r\n\r\n   42. The secular clergy, in order to give an example of respect\r\n   towards their Ordinaries, ought not to publish books, even when\r\n   treating of merely natural arts and sciences, without their\r\n   knowledge.\r\n\r\n   They are also prohibited from undertaking the management of\r\n   newspapers or periodicals without the previous permission of\r\n   their Ordinaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n                IV. OF PRINTERS AND PUBLISHERS OF BOOKS\r\n\r\n   43. No book liable to ecclesiastical censorship may be printed\r\n   unless it bear at the beginning the name and surname of both the\r\n   author and the publisher, together with the place and year of\r\n   printing and publishing. If in any particular case, owing to a\r\n   just reason, it appears desirable to suppress the name of the\r\n   author, this may be permitted by the Ordinary.\r\n\r\n   44. Printers and publishers should remember that new editions\r\n   of an approved work require a new approbation; and that an\r\n   approbation granted to the original text does not suffice for a\r\n   translation into another language.\r\n\r\n   45. Books condemned by the Apostolic See are to be considered as\r\n   prohibited all over the world, and into whatever language they\r\n   may be translated.\r\n\r\n   46. Booksellers, especially Catholics, should neither sell,\r\n   lend, nor keep books professedly treating of obscene subjects.\r\n   They should not keep for sale other prohibited books, unless\r\n   they have obtained leave through the Ordinary from the Sacred\r\n   Congregation of the Index; nor sell such books to any person\r\n   whom they do not prudently judge to have the right to buy them.\r\n\r\n\r\n         V. OF PENALTIES AGAINST TRANSGRESSORS OF THE GENERAL\r\n                                DECREES\r\n\r\n   47. All and every one knowingly reading, without authority of\r\n   the Holy See, the books of apostates and heretics, defending\r\n   heresy; or books of any author which are by name prohibited by\r\n   Apostolic Letters; also those keeping, printing, and in any way\r\n   defending such works; incur _ipso facto_ excommunication\r\n   reserved in a special manner to the Roman Pontiff.\r\n\r\n   48. Those who, without the approbation of the Ordinary,\r\n   print, or cause to be printed, books of Holy Scripture, or\r\n   notes or commentaries on the same, incur _ipso facto_\r\n   excommunication, but not reserved.\r\n\r\n   49. Those who transgress the other prescriptions of these\r\n   General Decrees shall, according to the gravity of their\r\n   offence, be seriously warned by the Bishop, and, if it seem\r\n   expedient, may also be punished by canonical penalties.\r\n\r\n   We decree that these presents and whatsoever they contain shall\r\n   at no time be questioned or impugned for any fault of subreption\r\n   or obreption, or of Our intention, or for any other defect\r\n   whatsoever; but are and shall be ever valid and efficacious, and\r\n   to be inviolably observed, both judicially and extrajudicially,\r\n   by all of whatsoever rank and preëminence. And We declare\r\n   to be invalid and of no avail, whatsoever may be attempted\r\n   knowingly or unknowingly contrary to these, by any one, under\r\n   any authority or pretext whatsoever; all to the contrary\r\n   notwithstanding.\r\n\r\n   And We will that the same authority be attributed to copies\r\n   of these Letters, even if printed, provided they be signed by\r\n   the hand of a Notary, and confirmed by the seal of some one in\r\n   ecclesiastical dignity, as to the indication of Our will by the\r\n   exhibition of these presents.\r\n\r\n   No man, therefore, may infringe or temerariously venture to\r\n   contravene this document of Our constitution, ordination,\r\n   limitation, derogation, and will. If any one shall so presume,\r\n   let him know that he will incur the wrath of Almighty God, and\r\n   of the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul.\r\n\r\n   Given at St. Peter’s in Rome, in the year of the Incarnation of\r\n   Our Lord one thousand eight hundred and ninety-seven, on the\r\n   25th day of January, in the nineteenth year of Our Pontificate.\r\n\r\n                                                A. CARD. MACCHI.\r\n\r\n    A. PANICI, Subdatary.\r\n           _Visa._\r\n\r\n    De Curia: J. DE AQUILA VISCONTI.\r\n          L. ✠ S.\r\n\r\n      Registered in the Secretariat of Briefs,\r\n                                                     I. CUGNONI.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE LISTS OF THE WORKS CONDEMNED\r\n\r\nIn the lists (as was the arrangement in the earlier Index of Leo) the\r\ndate of the decree under which the work was condemned is connected with\r\nthe title of the book. For the works (a considerable proportion of the\r\nentire series) which are entered both under the title and under the\r\nname of the author, cross references are given. The number of entries\r\nin the second Index of Leo is about 7000, practically the same as that\r\nin the earlier volume. Of the publications of the last ten years of\r\nthe 19th century, 131 works, representing 82 authors, are selected for\r\ncondemnation. These books of recent date comprise 60 Italian volumes,\r\n47 French, 16 Spanish and Portuguese, 4 German, and 4 English. This\r\nselection may be considered as indicative of the lack of familiarity\r\nof the examiners with the language or with the modern literature of\r\nGermany or of England.\r\n\r\nAs these two Indexes represent the latest authoritative expression of\r\nopinion in regard to the present literary policy of the Church of Rome,\r\nit is in order to present with some detail the character of the books\r\nselected for examination.\r\n\r\nIt is with the Leonine Indexes, as with all those that preceded,\r\ndifficult to arrive at the principle that has guided this selection.\r\nThe lists include no works of the heresiarchs, and in fact no titles\r\nback of the 17th century. Place has been found, however, for reprinting\r\na number of the prohibitions of the early 17th century, as well as for\r\nthose of the 18th. The Leonine decrees confirm those of the Indexes\r\nof Pius IV (Trent), 1564, of Clement VIII, 1596, and of Benedict XIV,\r\n1758, and the lists in these cover, of course, all the important\r\nheretical literature from the earliest date of printing. It is not\r\nclear on what principle have been selected the works of the 17th\r\ncentury which in the judgment of the Leonine editors were important\r\nenough to warrant a reiteration, three centuries later, of the original\r\ncondemnation. Still more difficult for these editors must have been\r\nthe selection from the great mass of fiction and of current literature\r\nof the past century, and more particularly of the last half of the\r\n19th century, of works that impressed them as sufficiently pernicious\r\nin character and abiding in their influence to call for specific\r\ncondemnation. The result of this selection impresses the student as\r\ncuriously disproportionate, and in fact as almost haphazard in its\r\ncharacter. The fiction which has been condemned is for the most part\r\nclassed under the description of _fabulae amatoriae_.\r\n\r\nI have noted the titles of certain works which seem to be in one way or\r\nanother typical or which would be likely to prove of interest to the\r\nEnglish-speaking readers of to-day.[157] It is doubtless the case that\r\nthe Italian literature (which constitutes the very large proportion of\r\nthe lists) possesses for the purposes of the indexer a distinctive\r\nimportance of its own, but these books are, I judge, less likely to be\r\nfamiliar to the readers who will be reached by my treatise. The dates\r\nplaced against the titles are those, not of publication, but of the\r\ndecrees, these decrees being in some cases as far as a century later\r\nthan the date of the original issue.\r\n\r\n   _Abrégé de l’histoire ecclésiastique de Fleury._ Decr. 1769.\r\n\r\n   ACTON, LORD. _Zur Geschichte des vaticanischen Conciles;\r\n   Sendschreiben an einen deutschen Bischof._ 1871.\r\n\r\n   ADDISON, JOS. _Remarks on Italy._ 1729.\r\n\r\n   ALBERTUS MAGNUS. _De Secretis Mulierum._ 1604.\r\n\r\n   _Alciphron_, by Berkeley. 1742.\r\n\r\n   _Anglica, Normanica_, etc., _a veteribus scripta_, etc. _d.c._\r\n   By Walsingham, etc., edit.

Index Revision and Reform, 1868–1880.=--Pomponio Leto reports[159]\r\nthat Pope Pius IX had instituted, in addition to the six existing\r\ncommissions of the council, a seventh commission placed under the\r\ndirection of Cardinal de Luca, which was to be charged with the\r\nconsideration of biblical material and of the revision of the Index. It\r\nappears, however, that this commission held but one or two sessions in\r\n1868 and after 1869 was not again called together.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time suggestions have been submitted for the reform of\r\nIndex proceedings. In 1870, eleven French bishops took the ground that\r\nno work by a Catholic writer should be condemned by the Congregation\r\nunless and until the author had had an opportunity of being heard in\r\nits defence and of replying to criticisms of any special passages. It\r\nseemed to these bishops outrageous that, possibly on the ground of the\r\nlack of correct understanding of certain individual passages, important\r\nbooks, representing the serious labour of devout scholars, should be\r\nplaced under the same class of condemnation as that applied to godless\r\nand heretical writings or to books _contra bonos mores_.[160]\r\n\r\nThe bishops of Germany joined in the demand for a reshaping of the\r\nrules of the Index for which in a number of territories it had not\r\nbeen practicable to secure obedience. They also demanded that in the\r\nfuture no book by a Catholic writer should be condemned until a hearing\r\nhad been given by the bishops to its author. It was contended that\r\nby means of such direct action the injury of an official censorship\r\nwould in a large number of cases be avoided. In a number of monographs\r\nprinted in 1869 and 1870, the contention was maintained that there\r\nshould be either a discontinuance of the operations of the Congregation\r\nof the Index or a thoroughgoing reform in the whole method of Church\r\ncensorship.[161]\r\n\r\nSegesser says, in his monograph entitled _Am Vorabende des\r\nConciliums_: “We do not admit that the Roman Index as now carried\r\non fulfils the purpose for which it was instituted. It seems to us\r\nthat the present censorship system, together with the method of\r\nsecuring from repentant authors ‘retractions’ and ‘submissions,’ leads\r\nonly to serious misapprehensions and confusions of judgment.... The\r\nresponsibility ought to be left to the bishops to take action, each for\r\nhis own diocese, concerning the books produced within the territory\r\nfor which he is responsible.” One of the editors of the _Mainzer\r\nKatholik_, writing in 1869, says[162]: “We accept the view which\r\nis now being presented very generally throughout the Church, that the\r\nreconstitution of the organisation and methods of Roman censorship is\r\nessential in order to meet the very great changes in the conditions of\r\nliterary production which have come about since the time of Benedict\r\nXIV.” Writing again later in the year, the same writer says:[163]\r\n\r\n   “It may well be doubted whether it is practicable, under the\r\n   present social conditions, to enforce any prohibition in\r\n   regard to the reading of books and whether, therefore, such\r\n   prohibitions are not pernicious rather than helpful.... We\r\n   are inclined to the belief that it would be wiser, in place\r\n   of leaving the books to be passed upon in Rome, to place the\r\n   responsibility for their examination in the hands of the bishop\r\n   of the diocese.... We do not recommend that the Index should\r\n   be abandoned, but it should certainly be revised in order to\r\n   meet the new conditions of the present time. We submit with all\r\n   deference the suggestion that a theological literary organ might\r\n   properly be published in Bonn, and similar journals, speaking\r\n   under the authority of the Church, in such centres as Munich\r\n   and Tübingen. Such journals would, with their conclusions,\r\n   criticisms, and recommendations, carry weight and wholesome\r\n   influence among all faithful readers in the Church. A central\r\n   organ of literature, speaking with all the authority of the\r\n   Holy See and Church universal, should be published in Rome. In\r\n   such a journal should be presented the record of theoloical\r\n   literary activities throughout the whole world. The conclusions\r\n   and criticisms issued under the official authority of Rome would\r\n   in themselves constitute a standard of theological orthodoxy\r\n   and of literary form.... For such an undertaking, the support\r\n   and the interest of devout Catholics throughout the world would\r\n   be assured. Its influence would have the effect of an Index or\r\n   censorship of literature. Such a journal should serve as a guide\r\n   and an inspiration towards a true Catholic life.”\r\n\r\nA periodical which was in existence for a few years during the last\r\ndecade of the 18th century appears to have had some such purpose as\r\nthis writer considers important. The _Giornale Ecclesiastico_,\r\na weekly journal published in Rome from July, 1785, to June, 1798,\r\npresented, together with Church news and general information, a weekly\r\nreview of books. The journal included further the decrees issued,\r\nduring this period of fourteen years, by the censorship authorities of\r\nRome, against the books selected for condemnation. The first volume\r\nrecorded in these decrees is a treatise entitled _Was ist der\r\nPabst?_ published anonymously but identified as the work of Eybel.\r\nIt receives the honour of a condemnation, not in the ordinary form, but\r\nin an elaborate “constitution” printed over the signature of Pope Pius\r\nVI. The treatise had been issued at a critical time when the Pope found\r\nground for alarm at the reformations announced by Joseph II. One of the\r\nworks condemned in the later decrees was the _Pensées_ of Pascal,\r\nwith Voltaire’s notes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Infallibility of the Pope]\r\n\r\nThe criticism has been made more than once on the part of Protestant\r\nhistorians of the Index that the record of the conflicting decisions\r\ngiven by successive popes in regard to literary productions itself\r\nconstitutes a substantial argument against the reasonableness of the\r\ndoctrine of infallibility. This doctrine became officially one of the\r\ndogmas of the Church at the Council of the Lateran in 1870. It is the\r\nunderstanding that, while the declaration of the dogma was made this\r\nyear for the first time, under the necessary interpretation of such\r\ndogma, it would be held to apply to the utterances of all the popes\r\npreceding Pius IX. The orthodox interpreters of Catholic doctrine\r\npoint out, however, that the claim for infallibility does not cover\r\nall classes of papal utterances. Father Searle, for instance (writing\r\nin New York, 1895), makes the following statement in regard to the\r\northodox interpretation of this dogma:\r\n\r\n   “The special prerogative which Catholics now universally believe\r\n   to have been conferred on the Pope by the Divine Founder of\r\n   Christianity has a very special and limited range, although\r\n   certainly quite complete within its proper domain. It consists\r\n   in the Pope’s ability to decide questions concerning religion\r\n   about which there may be room for doubt in the minds of\r\n   Christians, on account either of the large number of adherents\r\n   or of the apparently plausible arguments on both sides of the\r\n   question.... It should be clearly understood that it is not the\r\n   office of the Pope to act as one inspired or to receive or give\r\n   to the world any new revelation. It is merely to decide what the\r\n   original deposit (as we call it) of faith was, as committed by\r\n   Christ to his Apostles; or in other words to repeat the decision\r\n   which the Apostles themselves would have made in regard to the\r\n   doctrines of Christianity. Still less is it the office of the\r\n   Pope to settle matters of science or ordinary questions of fact.\r\n   Not but what the domains claimed by science and the domains\r\n   claimed by faith may sometimes overlap; this may be the case for\r\n   instance to some extent in the matter of evolution, especially\r\n   if evolution is supposed to apply to the human soul, or it may\r\n   apply in the cases in which science asserts that matter existed\r\n   from all eternity.... And even questions of historical fact may\r\n   belong to faith by being necessarily connected with some of\r\n   its dogmas, or by forming part of the inspired record of Holy\r\n   Scripture. There would, for instance, be a conflict of history\r\n   or of geology with the Church, if it should be asserted in the\r\n   name of either of these branches of learning that the account\r\n   of the Deluge was simply a myth. But conflicts of this sort are\r\n   rare. Practically no Catholic is impeded in any kind of study\r\n   or investigation by any fear of papal condemnation.... The\r\n   impression of Protestants that we Catholics believe the Pope to\r\n   be incapable of error, no matter what he is speaking about or\r\n   under what circumstances he expresses his thought, is of course\r\n   without foundation.... The Catholics do, however, believe that\r\n   the Pope is able to make infallible decisions with regard to\r\n   morals as well as to faith.... But it by no means follows that\r\n   because the Pope can solemnly instruct the faithful infallibly,\r\n   he always or on all occasions holds or gives utterance to\r\n   correct views with regard to right or wrong.... We hold simply\r\n   that God assists the Pope in a special way to prevent him from\r\n   making a decision at all if the way is not reasonably clear to\r\n   it; or if God allows the decision to be made, to insure that\r\n   this decision shall contain nothing contrary to the truth.”[164]\r\n\r\nIt seems probable from the position taken by Father Searle that in the\r\ncases in which the utterances of the Papacy have by later events been\r\nshown to be based upon error or have even directly been recalled or\r\ncorrected by later papal utterances, the Catholic of to-day would take\r\nthe ground that these erroneous utterances did not belong to the class\r\nfor which infallibility was claimed. Under this class of exceptions\r\nwould doubtless be placed the condemnation of Galileo, and also the\r\ncondemnation of certain Catholic books maintaining doctrines not\r\naccepted at the time as dogmas of the Church but which later secured\r\nofficial acceptance.\r\n\r\n\r\n=3. The Index and the Liberal Catholics, in 1897. “Romanus” and\r\n“The Tablet.”=--In October, 1897, after the promulgation of the\r\nfirst Index of Leo XIII and at the time when announcements concerning\r\nthe scheme of the second Index were being made, a writer in the\r\n_Contemporary Review_ undertook to present views in regard to the\r\nliterary policy of the Church of Rome and its responsibilities towards\r\nthe intellectual development of the century. The writer subscribes\r\nhimself “Romanus” and writes as a faithful and conscientious member\r\nof the Catholic Church. He claims to be expressing the apprehensions\r\nof a large body of educated Catholics in England and on the Continent\r\nas to the probable loss of influence on the part of the Church and\r\nof the weakening of its hold on men possessing both education and\r\nconscience, in case its present rulers should persist in maintaining a\r\nmediaeval policy in regard to intellectual matters. “Romanus” insists\r\nthat the Church must accept and abide by all of the conclusions of\r\nmodern science the foundations of which are shown to be thoroughly\r\nassured, and that unless the Church may make science its own, it must\r\nof necessity lose influence with conscientious students throughout the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nI cite below some of the more noteworthy utterances in this article.\r\n\r\n“Leo XIII,” says “Romanus,” “has inspired respect and sympathy even\r\namong men who are strongly opposed to Catholicism.” He goes on to speak\r\nof Leo as that “gentle, cultured, conciliatory pontiff, the promoter\r\nof historical research, the friend of the French Republic.” The main\r\npurpose of his article is to show that “liberal Catholicism,” so far\r\nfrom having ceased to exist, has only been transformed into a much more\r\n“formidable movement.”\r\n\r\n   “Liberal Catholics,” says “Romanus,” “are fully aware that\r\n   the enormous power of the Church for good would be fatally\r\n   impaired by an injury to its organisation, and they would\r\n   regard as intrinsically absurd and unscientific any attempt\r\n   to reverse the process of development. Their desire is,\r\n   therefore, not to destroy, but to strengthen the authority of\r\n   the Church by diverting it from proceedings detrimental to\r\n   its own welfare.... They are profoundly convinced that the\r\n   Catholic Church is the one great influence for promoting the\r\n   spiritual welfare of humanity. They believe that there exists\r\n   no power comparable to it for the promotion of virtue and of\r\n   all that is highest, noblest, purest, and most self-denying and\r\n   generous among mankind. They are convinced that it is the most\r\n   complete--the only complete--organisation for bringing about\r\n   among all classes, all nations, and all races, obedience to, and\r\n   fulfilment of, Christ’s two great commandments wherein lay all\r\n   the law and the prophets--love of God and of our neighbour.\r\n\r\n   “Such Catholics also believe that the Church supplies, to our\r\n   minds, as no other yet existing organisation can supply, means\r\n   of access and address to their Creator through a worship such\r\n   as the world has never before known--traditional, majestic,\r\n   soul-satisfying, and, above all, profoundly spiritual, wherein\r\n   the divine and human meet and _cor ad cor loquitur_.\r\n\r\n   “By its sacraments, every stage of human life is elevated and\r\n   sanctified, the wounded conscience renovated and strengthened,\r\n   the broken and contrite heart comforted and consoled, the\r\n   various afflictions of life mitigated and its joys, as well as\r\n   its sorrows, refined and consecrated.... These liberal Catholics\r\n   not only look upon Catholicity as the special home and the\r\n   most effective aid to what is good, but also as an influence\r\n   making for beauty and the culture of art. Its influence with\r\n   respect to philosophy they regard as of priceless value, nor\r\n   do they think lightly of its service to literature. Profoundly\r\n   influenced by such convictions, the adherents to ‘Liberal\r\n   Catholicism’ must evidently desire to maintain unimpaired that\r\n   wonderful organisation of which Rome is the head.... Liberal\r\n   Catholics declare themselves to be devoted to the discovery,\r\n   the promulgation, and the establishment of truth in every\r\n   field of knowledge, historical, critical, and scientific,\r\n   especially in what bears upon religion. Sincere Theists, they\r\n   are profoundly convinced not only that the God of truth can\r\n   never be served by a lie, but that the cause of religion can\r\n   never be promoted by clever dodges, by studiously ambiguous\r\n   utterances, by hushing up unpleasant truths, or (when such\r\n   can no longer be hidden) by misrepresenting or minimising\r\n   their significance--trying by a series of clever devices to\r\n   disguise the consequences which logically follow from them. As\r\n   St. Paul strenuously opposed himself to the circumcision of\r\n   the flesh, so would the Liberal Catholics oppose themselves\r\n   to the circumcision of the intellect. These believers are not\r\n   so foolish as to be blind to the fact that a body so vast and\r\n   complex in structure as the Catholic Church must move slowly.\r\n   It neither surprises nor shocks them that new astronomical,\r\n   geological, or physiological truths should not be accepted with\r\n   alacrity or that discoveries as to the Old and New Testaments\r\n   and startling facts with respect to the organisation of the\r\n   Church in the first two centuries should not be welcomed with\r\n   enthusiasm and loudly proclaimed.... What liberalism does not\r\n   understand, what it vehemently protests against and deems fatal\r\n   to the welfare of the Church, is not reticence, but declarations\r\n   hostile to and condemnatory of ascertained scientific truth.\r\n   No one in authority would probably now venture to affirm in so\r\n   many words that Catholics must regard as historical facts such\r\n   matters as the legend of the Serpent and the Tree, that of the\r\n   formation of Eve, Noah’s Ark, the destruction of Sodom, the\r\n   transformation of Lot’s wife, the talking ass, or Jonah and his\r\n   whale; nevertheless (not only from what is popularly taught,\r\n   but from what has been put forth in the name of the Supreme\r\n   Pontiff) it would seem as if Reuss, Welhausen, and Keunen had\r\n   never written at all, instead of having transformed our whole\r\n   conception of the Hexateuch. Liberal Catholics need demand no\r\n   formal disavowals. What they do most strongly deprecate are\r\n   needless declarations freshly made in the full light of modern\r\n   science, physical, physiological, historical, or critical, yet\r\n   futilely hostile thereto. The well-known Syllabus of Pius IX\r\n   afforded a memorable instance of what is thus objected to.... It\r\n   was so worded as to make plain men believe that their reasonable\r\n   liberties had been condemned, and many tender consciences were\r\n   greatly troubled thereby. A year or two back, Leo XIII, in a\r\n   letter concerning the Bible, afforded a most amazing example of\r\n   misleading ambiguity.... It is understood that for this letter\r\n   he was not personally to blame, his will having been overborne\r\n   by the influence of the Jesuits of the _Civiltà Cattolica_.\r\n   This letter contains, to be sure, a certain recognition of\r\n   modern science; but it broadly declares that the Bible contains\r\n   no error.... English Catholics have been played with of late\r\n   in the matter of a new Index in a singularly inept and absurd\r\n   manner, owing to the fact that the players at Rome are so\r\n   densely ignorant concerning the state of things in England.\r\n\r\n   “The old Index was never supposed to be binding on English\r\n   Catholics and, indeed, its provisions were such that it was\r\n   practically almost a dead letter on the Continent also.... The\r\n   new Index is, however, formally declared to be applicable to\r\n   all countries, and great has been the distress which through\r\n   its publication arose in the minds of a multitude of timid and\r\n   scrupulous believers.... Pressure was brought to bear upon Rome,\r\n   which was forced at last to learn something of the condition\r\n   of affairs in England, and finally supreme authority has had to\r\n   draw in its horns and suffer it to be spread about in England\r\n   that the new reformed Index does not apply here, and that in\r\n   this happy country every condemned publication can be read,\r\n   and any work on morals or religion published and circulated,\r\n   without ecclesiastics having the power to prevent it.... Since\r\n   the affair of the Index, however, a yet more monstrous act\r\n   has been perpetrated. Any one who has taken any interest in\r\n   Scripture knows that for many years past the text in the Epistle\r\n   of St. John about ‘the three witnesses’ (the Father, Son, and\r\n   Holy Ghost in heaven) has been regarded as a spurious addition.\r\n   An application was lately made to Rome to know whether the\r\n   authenticity of this well-known text might safely be called in\r\n   question. The reply was that it might neither be denied nor\r\n   called in question. Thus authority, in this last act, has shown\r\n   an utter contempt for historical and critical truth, and that\r\n   it desires its spiritual subjects should be left to believe\r\n   that an absolutely unauthentic passage is an inspired statement\r\n   written ‘by the finger of God.’... We live in a critical period.\r\n   Dogmatic statements require special care when, thanks to the\r\n   labours of such men as Harnack and Weiszäcker, so much light has\r\n   been thrown on the genesis and history of dogma and the earliest\r\n   condition of the Christian Church. But the diffusion of any such\r\n   knowledge is but little perilous if only authority will refrain\r\n   from self-destructive affirmations.... The advance of physical\r\n   science necessarily carries with it changes in religious belief,\r\n   as astronomy and geology unquestionably show. But changes in\r\n   moral science and consequent modifications in human sentiment\r\n   produce changes of far greater moment.... It is then above all\r\n   things necessary that ecclesiastical authority should help in\r\n   the elevation of popular ethical ideals, instead of trying,\r\n   as the Catholic Church has in many cases already done, to\r\n   retain these at a lower stage of development.... The scientific\r\n   teaching now current about the Old and the New Testament, the\r\n   history of dogma and of the beginnings of the Church, must\r\n   doubtless disturb the minds of many faithful Catholics now as\r\n   future discoveries in the field of physiology will disturb the\r\n   minds of persons who are to come after us. We are and we wish\r\n   to remain in sympathy with the Church of centuries long gone;\r\n   but surely we should also wish and strive to pave the way for\r\n   the triumph of the Church in ages yet to come. We emphasise the\r\n   importance of attention to past changes and the necessity of\r\n   great consideration and accommodation on the part of authority\r\n   at the present time and yet more in the future. We urge this\r\n   because we are devoted to the cause of the Catholic Church;\r\n   we urge this as humble followers of the great Apostle of the\r\n   Gentiles, in the name of Him who was the first great teacher\r\n   of ‘accommodation’ and who, as the great opponent of pharisaic\r\n   narrowness, emphatically deserves the honourable title of the\r\n   first ‘Liberal Catholic’ of the Universal Church of Christ.”\r\n\r\nThe criticism of “Romanus,” speaking on behalf of the Liberal\r\nCatholics, was promptly taken up by an “orthodox” Romanist, evidently\r\na strong opponent of Liberal Catholicism, who is prepared to accept\r\nwithout question the authority and the policy of Pius and Leo in regard\r\nto the supervision of literature and the direction of the intellectual\r\nlife of the Church. The reply of the defender of the papal policy\r\nappears in the _Tablet_ (which may, I suppose, be considered as\r\nthe official organ of the Church in England) in December, 1897. The\r\nfollowing extracts will give the main conclusions of this upholder of\r\npapal authority.\r\n\r\n   “The article in the _Contemporary Review_ which claims to\r\n   represent the views of ‘Liberal Catholicism’ is not entitled to\r\n   any serious attention on the part of educated Catholics. Its\r\n   matter and its spirit are well known to them _ad nauseam_,\r\n   and they easily recognise one and the other as a part of the\r\n   stock-in-trade of certain writers who not unnaturally conceive\r\n   that they can attack the Catholic Church more plausibly by\r\n   affecting to stand within her pale, and while masquerading\r\n   (anonymously, of course) under the name of Catholic. The only\r\n   passage in the _Contemporary_ article which is deserving\r\n   of any present attention is that relating to the modification\r\n   of the recent Constitution of the Index. In January last, the\r\n   Holy See was pleased to simplify, and in many respects to\r\n   modify, the provisions of the Index, and issued a Constitution\r\n   to that effect. Like all legislation of a general kind, it was\r\n   issued to the Church as a whole. The Holy See, following its\r\n   most wise tradition, frames its general law upon the needs of\r\n   the bulk or majority of its subjects, and makes such law, for\r\n   the time being, the standard of the community, knowing that if\r\n   its provisions, in whole or in part, should, owing to peculiar\r\n   circumstances, become inapplicable to the minority or should\r\n   press unduly upon them, their case can easily be met either\r\n   by local modification, or by personal dispensation where they\r\n   affect an individual or a class. A good deal of cheap rhetoric\r\n   is often wasted upon the narrowness and intolerance of the\r\n   authorities of the Index. We are concerned with the law itself\r\n   and with the principles which underlie this law and with the\r\n   reasons which justify it. The measure of discretion (or of\r\n   indiscretion) which characterises the action of the authorities\r\n   in the administration of the law and in its application to this\r\n   or that book or opinion deserves separate consideration....\r\n   It may safely be asserted that not a little of the ordinary\r\n   criticism of the regulations of the Index is due in many cases\r\n   to insularity. Probably out of every hundred Englishmen or\r\n   Americans who rail against the restrictions of the Index, not\r\n   a tithe has any direct acquaintance with, or takes any due\r\n   account of, the flood of bitterly anti-Christian literature,\r\n   often infidel, immoral, and blasphemous, and almost always\r\n   insidiously polemical, which is poured over Italy and the\r\n   Continent generally, by the masonic and anti-clerical press.\r\n   It is in great measure this degrading abuse of one of the\r\n   noblest faculties of civilised society, and the need of duly\r\n   protecting the minds of the masses that the provisions of the\r\n   Index are specially designed to meet. It is simply a measure of\r\n   Catholic sanitation. In fact, were a representative collection\r\n   of such continental literature translated and put into the\r\n   hands of the average English father, we conceive that he would\r\n   promptly improvise himself into a domestic Congregation of the\r\n   Index and take pains to see that all such vehicles of infection\r\n   were rigidly excluded from his family.... That the Catholic\r\n   Church, which is necessarily an authoritative and a teaching\r\n   Church, should be equally solicitous about the members of her\r\n   family, and that from her standpoint she should extend her\r\n   solicitude, not only to manifest evils but to assaults upon the\r\n   faith which she believes to be the logical sub-structure of\r\n   morality, is a principle which assuredly need not excite our\r\n   surprise. However much we may feel that, in times like our own,\r\n   when our best triumphs promise to be gained by guiding, rather\r\n   than by limiting human liberty, and when necessarily much must\r\n   be left to the discretion of the conscientious, the practical\r\n   application of the principle is a matter which calls for the\r\n   exercise of that generous and tactful delicacy that the Catholic\r\n   Church knows so well how to use in teaching her children.... No\r\n   one who looks upon the face of Christendom to-day can fail to\r\n   note that there exists a clearly marked difference between the\r\n   whole set of social and political circumstances which obtain\r\n   in the English-speaking lands and those which obtain in the\r\n   various countries of the Continent. This difference applies\r\n   particularly to the very circumstances which most affect the use\r\n   and application of the provisions of the Index.... We maintain\r\n   that in English-speaking countries there does not exist upon any\r\n   large or popular scale such bitter and active propaganda against\r\n   Christianity and Christian morality as are unhappily at work\r\n   abroad, nor is there that widespread prevalence of aggressively\r\n   anti-Christian and pornographic literature which the infidel\r\n   and anti-clerical press pours forth like a pestilential sewer in\r\n   certain continental countries. The Church has wisely taken into\r\n   account the special character and circumstances of Catholics in\r\n   the English-speaking countries, and the significance which as\r\n   expressing the more modern development of social and political\r\n   life they promise to possess in the future. For centuries, the\r\n   provisions of the Index in their more rigid sense have not been\r\n   practically applied to these countries, and to a very large\r\n   measure these provisions have been left in abeyance with the\r\n   perfect knowledge of the Supreme Authority.... The Constitution\r\n   published by the Holy See, in January last, was naturally issued\r\n   to the Church at large, and when it appeared in the Catholic\r\n   press of England it necessarily elicited from both clergy and\r\n   laity the question whether this new Constitution was or was not\r\n   intended to supplant the _status quo_ which had hitherto\r\n   existed among us. The reply to the enquiry addressed to Rome\r\n   by the Cardinal Archbishop and bishops of England, conceded\r\n   the most ample powers for dispensation, so that, owing to the\r\n   ‘special circumstances of the country,’ the bishops in England\r\n   were fully authorised ‘to modify the rigour of the law by their\r\n   prudence and counsel according as the case might demand.’\r\n   Rome’s reply was thus as ready and as liberal as could well be\r\n   desired....\r\n\r\n   “No Catholic forgets or can ever allow himself to forget that\r\n   the Index is at most an institution which has been called into\r\n   existence by the practical prudence of the Holy See to safeguard\r\n   and to hedge around with specific regulations the observance of\r\n   a moral law that is as old as Christianity itself and that, even\r\n   if the regulations of the Index were abolished to-morrow, would\r\n   remain in all its force in the Catholic Church. If the faithful\r\n   Catholic in the course of his reading finds by experience that\r\n   a given book is of a kind to undermine his faith or to work\r\n   injury to his morals, he knows that he is bound by the very fact\r\n   to deal with it as he would with a proximate occasion of sin,\r\n   and to cast it aside. Christianity by its very condition means\r\n   discipline. In it the unbridled freedom of thinking, saying,\r\n   reading, and doing what we like is exchanged for the higher\r\n   and holier freedom of union with the mind and with the life of\r\n   Christ. The moral law of the Church is everywhere and always\r\n   with us and every good Christian carries about with him inside\r\n   of his own conscience a Constitution of the Index....”\r\n\r\nThis article may, I judge, while now eight years old, fairly be\r\naccepted as an authoritative utterance on the part of the thoroughly\r\northodox Romanists of England, that is to say, of those who accept\r\nwithout question the decisions and the regulations from Rome. The\r\nwriter in the _Tablet_ declines, or, to speak more precisely,\r\ncontemptuously refuses, to meet any of the specific criticisms of\r\n“Romanus” in regard to this or that text or to the relations of the\r\nChurch with the conclusions of scientists. He bases his conclusions\r\nupon a general and implicit acceptance of the final authority of\r\nthe Church in all matters and he apparently holds that only in such\r\nreverent acceptance and obedience can there be a religious sanity in\r\nthis world or hope for the world to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n=4. The Present Methods of Roman Censorship.=--The Papal\r\nConsistory may be considered as a direct successor or at least\r\na continuation of the chancellery of the Roman Empire. When (in\r\n328), the Emperor Constantine moved the court to Byzantium, he left\r\nthe chancellery in Rome and the authority or organisation of this\r\nchancellery came to be associated with the authority of the Bishop of\r\nRome.\r\n\r\nThe term Curia or Holy See is used to represent the Church organisation\r\nor final authority of the Church considered more particularly in its\r\nrelations with foreign States or with outside bodies.\r\n\r\nThe Congregations date in their final organisation from Sixtus V\r\n(1585). The series now comprises eighteen. These Congregations might\r\nbe compared in the nature and in the exercise of their functions to\r\nthe standing committees of the United States Senate; excepting that\r\ntheir decisions do not have to be referred to any general body for\r\naction. These decisions are final unless disapproved by the pope. The\r\npope retains for himself the official headship of the Congregation of\r\nthe Index on the ground that the work of this Congregation has to do\r\ndirectly with matters of doctrine. The working body of the Congregation\r\nof the Index comprises ten to twelve members with votes, including\r\nalways a group of cardinals. In addition to these voting members, there\r\nis a varying number of _consultores_ (advisers) who are called in\r\nas experts in different divisions of knowledge, but who have no votes\r\nin the decisions arrived at. The Congregation which bears the name\r\nPropaganda is charged with the responsibility of receiving and sifting\r\nmiscellaneous business, referring each division of such business to\r\nits appropriate Congregation. The Congregation of the Index has from\r\nthe outset been conducted under the influence and under the practical\r\ncontrol of the Order of the Dominicans. The secretary, who bears the\r\nname “commissarius” and who is always a Dominican, has the general\r\nresponsibility for the selecting and the shaping of the business of\r\nthe Congregation. It is to the commissarius that suggestions are\r\nsubmitted by ecclesiastics or others concerning books which, in\r\ntheir judgment, call for the consideration of the Congregation. The\r\ncommissarius is also himself under obligation to submit titles of\r\ndoubtful books of which he has personal knowledge. The exceptional\r\ninfluence of the Jesuits in statecraft and in personal relations\r\nwith the popes and with other of the authorities of the Church is\r\nconsidered as constituting some measure of offset to the influence\r\nthat the Dominicans have, in their control of the Index, been able to\r\nexert concerning the acceptance (or the reprobation) of literature\r\npresenting the special doctrines of the Jesuits. The method of thought\r\nand of reasoning of the Dominicans is, it is to be borne in mind,\r\nbased upon the teachings of Thomas of Aquinas and of the Thomists.\r\nThe Franciscans are described as the commemorators of the mystical\r\nspirit of Duns Scotus. The leadership in intellectual activity in the\r\nChurch is said to rest to-day, as it has rested through the centuries,\r\nwith the Jesuits. The great Order of the Benedictines and that of the\r\nCistercians are still referred to as making some of the largest and\r\nmost important contributions to literature that come from Catholic\r\nsources.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remembered that the bishop possesses in his own diocese\r\na very large measure of independent authority, authority which may\r\nbe considered as increasing in direct proportion to the distance of\r\nthe diocese from Rome. This local authority is utilised in connection\r\nwith literary censorship as for other matters affecting the action\r\nof believers. This censorship of the bishops is naturally of special\r\nimportance when it has to do with books originating in languages other\r\nthan Italian or Latin, as such books are less likely to be brought to\r\nthe attention of the censorship authorities in Rome.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the literary policy of the Church to-day as expressed in\r\nthe Index, the opinion of the Jesuit Father Hilgers is of interest.\r\nIn reply to the enquiry, “What is the Index?” Hilgers presents (in\r\nthe treatise before referred to) the following statement, the text of\r\nwhich I have somewhat condensed: “The Index of prohibited books does\r\nnot contain or undertake to present the entire regulation or body of\r\nthe enactments of the Church concerning the supervision of literature\r\nand the specification of prohibited books. This body of Church law\r\nis to be found in the general Decrees or Regulations (_Decreta\r\nGeneralia_) of the Constitution, known as the _Officiorum ac\r\nmunerum_. It is of course to be understood that the editions of\r\nthe Index are controlled by the general prohibitions (that is to say,\r\nby the prohibitions which, in place of specifying individual works,\r\nexpress a general literary policy) and also by what may be called the\r\nlaw of nature.... It is not safe for a believer to say, ‘as this book\r\nis not found in the Index, I am at liberty to read it.’ It should be\r\nunderstood that the book in question or any similar work may fall under\r\nthe prohibition of the general rule or may under the law of nature\r\nbe classed as pernicious. It is undoubtedly the case that many books\r\nwhich are pernicious for faith or for morals are not to be found in the\r\nIndex. It would of course be a physical impossibility to include in any\r\ncurrent lists all of the books of bad character or of bad influence\r\nwhich each year are being brought before the public. The Index is to\r\nbe considered as itself a portion of the general Church prohibitions.\r\nIt is not even to be admitted that the most dangerous or pernicious\r\nhave with certainty found their way into Indexes, either the earlier or\r\nthose that are now in force. The books which are undeniably bad should\r\nso reveal themselves to the conscience of the believer and are in any\r\ncase clearly indicated by the law of the Church. This is the answer to\r\nthe criticism that has more than once been made that the Congregation\r\nof the Index has concerned itself with the trivial or petty things,\r\nleaving without consideration books which are of most serious\r\nmoment, for instance works belonging to the emphatically bad group.\r\nExamples of such are--in literature: those of Carl Gutzkow and Conrad\r\nFerdinand Meyer; in natural science, those of Haeckel and of Krause\r\n(Carus-sterne); in philosophy, the writings of Feuerbach and Büchner;\r\nin theology, the works of F. C. Baur and of Bruno Bauer, etc. Against\r\nnames like these, the caution of specific condemnation in the Index\r\nought not to be required by any intelligent reader. There are to-day\r\nso-called philosophers whose representative works can be recognised as\r\ndangerous by the reason of each intelligent person, and these works it\r\nhas therefore not been thought necessary to place in the Index. The\r\nvery fact that the total number of books appearing in the Index is so\r\ninconsiderable is to be accepted as evidence that there has been no\r\nattempt to make specific condemnation of the whole mass of pernicious\r\nliterature.” According to the calculation of Hilgers, the Indexes of\r\nthe last three hundred years contain an average of sixteen new titles\r\nonly for each year; and these sixteen titles represent the total of the\r\nselections made from the literatures of all the countries of the world,\r\nprincipally of course of those of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Index presents for us a collection of the utterances of the Church\r\nauthorities concerning specific condemnations of individual books.\r\nIt may be said to bear the same relation to the general censorship\r\ndecrees as that borne, for instance, by a collection of the judgments\r\nof a criminal court to the provisions of criminal law. It is the\r\nbusiness of the court to arrive at a judgment in each individual\r\ncase and in each case to determine whether the law has been broken.\r\nThe Index condemnations, like the court judgments, may be accepted as\r\nrepresentative in the one case of the general policy or principles by\r\nwhich the Church is guided and in the other case of the principles and\r\nof the provisions of the law. In the Constitution _Officiorum ac\r\nmunerum_, section I, chapter 10, is the instruction: “While it is\r\nthe duty of all believers, and particularly of the educated Catholic,\r\nto bring to the attention of the authorities of the Curia or of the\r\nbishops, books believed to be dangerous, this responsibility rests\r\nmore particularly upon the nuncios, the Apostolic delegates, and the\r\nrectors and associates of the higher schools.” The word denunciation\r\nhas a serious sound and yet such a word may be applied as describing\r\nthe duty of any magistrate acting under the law of the land. “The\r\nIndex is not,” continues Hilgers, “and never has claimed to be, a\r\nsystematic and comprehensive collection of the titles of each class\r\nof prohibited books. It is no more just on this ground, however, that\r\nthe Index should be charged with lack of system, plan, or consistency\r\nthan that the civil authority should be criticised because, under the\r\nactual working of the law, there may not be each year examples of\r\nthe imposition of penalties for all the offences specified.... It is\r\nfurther to be borne in mind that the influence of any particular work\r\nis naturally not the same during different periods or under different\r\nconditions; a book which at the time when certain issues were pending\r\nmight have exercised a seriously pernicious influence, could for later\r\ngenerations, under different conditions, be studied safely simply as an\r\nhistorical record. It is the purpose of the Index as of the _Decreta\r\nGeneralia_ to protect and defend the true Faith, sound morality, and\r\nwholesome conduct. The censorship prohibitions constitute one means\r\nby which those to whom has been confided the care of the flock of the\r\nfaithful may be enabled to fulfil their responsibilities.”\r\n\r\n“In case there may be question of the accusation of any person for\r\nheretical doctrine the examination of the matter or the control of the\r\ncase is held not under the direction of the Congregation of the Index,\r\nbut under that of the Roman Inquisition. The condemnation of the book\r\ndoes not in itself carry with it a condemnation of the individual.”[165]\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Spencer Jones, in his treatise _England and the Holy\r\nSee_, printed in London, 1902, remarks that, in such cases, “when\r\na teacher is silenced and his books have been placed upon the Index\r\na large proportion of the public are apt to entertain pity for him,\r\nwhich is natural; but feel little concern for those on whose behalf\r\nthe Church has interfered, which shows want of sympathy and contempt\r\nfor the authorities, which is for the most part unjust; the assumption\r\nbeing that because they judge it right to stay the treatise, they\r\ntherefore wish to stop the truth.”[166]\r\n\r\nA further criticism has been made against the Index on the ground\r\nof the indignity caused to works of science and to productions of\r\nliterature of thought in associating these under condemnation with\r\nvulgar erotic romances or with the passing pamphlet of the moment.\r\nThe Catholic answer is very simple: the Church is responsible for\r\nthe correction of error in whatsoever form such error may take. Such\r\naction in regard to an error, whether this be a thought or form of\r\nexpression, does not of necessity imply that the writer is himself\r\nunworthy. The Church may properly honour and does honour a faithful\r\nbeliever and great thinker like Fénelon, and may at the same time, in\r\nits watchfulness over sound thought and precise expression, find it\r\nnecessary to correct some single utterance of Fénelon. The true Faith\r\nhas to do not only with understanding but with the preservation of the\r\npurity of the soul and of right feeling.\r\n\r\nIt may be at once admitted that the regulations of the Congregation\r\nof the Index do not claim for themselves an infallible authority\r\nconcerning matters of doctrine. The book prohibitions, while approved\r\nby the pope, do not (unless with rare exceptions) emanate directly from\r\nhim and do not, therefore, partake of the infallibility of his Office.\r\nThe pope can of course, in the cases in which it seems to him right so\r\nto do, decide with his own infallible judgment that the doctrine of a\r\nbook is heretical and such a decision must carry with it full weight.\r\nThe general prohibitions of the Index are, however, to be considered\r\nas simply an expression or conclusion concerning dogma in the narrower\r\nsense of the word. Such prohibitions may be considered as coming from\r\nthe ecclesiastical court before which the book in question has been\r\nunder trial and through such judgment the book is either condemned or\r\npassed upon as not a subject for disapproval.[167]\r\n\r\nHilgers calls attention to the method of procedure under which the\r\nsuccessive Indexes collected into their lists the titles of books that\r\nhad been condemned (in certain cases many years before) in specific\r\ndecrees. The Index authorities have, he says, been criticised for\r\nbringing into condemnation books having to do with controversial\r\nquestions, years after these questions have been practically adjusted\r\nor were no longer vital matters. The answer is that the literature was\r\nconsidered at the proper time under a separate decree and the Index\r\nmerely presents a summary of such decrees. The Index of Leo XIII makes\r\nclear in its record of condemnations of earlier date the immediate\r\nsource for each condemnation; whether this took the form of a papal\r\nbrief or bull or whether it was arrived at through the decision of one\r\nof the papal Congregations. The books which have been condemned under\r\na separate Apostolic edict (brief or bull) comprise in all a hundred\r\nand forty titles and these have been printed in each Leonine Index\r\nwith a cross. During the three centuries between 1600 and 1900, the\r\nCongregation of the Holy Office, that is to say, the Roman Inquisition,\r\nhas issued in all nine hundred book prohibitions. These are entered\r\nin the Leonine lists with the words: _Decr. S. Off._ During the\r\nsame period, the Congregation of Rites has prohibited in all but three\r\nbooks. The Congregation of Dispensations has issued two condemnation\r\ndecrees. It is clear from the above reference that each Congregation\r\nhas been charged with the supervision of the literature belonging to\r\nits own special subject-matter. The Congregation of the Index, however,\r\nis concerned with the books in every division of literature because\r\nits subject is the examination and determination of works classed as\r\nsuspected. The entries for which the Congregation of the Index is\r\nresponsible during the three centuries in question aggregate about\r\nthree thousand. As before stated, the power rests with the pope to\r\nexamine and to pass judgment upon any book without the intervention of\r\nany one of the Congregations.\r\n\r\nThe Leonine Index repeats but two prohibitions back of the date of\r\n1600. The first, bearing date 1575, makes entry of the title of the\r\n_Chronicon_ of Conrad of Lichtenau, and the second, under the\r\ndate of 1580, the title of _Il Salmista secondo la Bibbia_, etc.\r\nDuring the above specified period, covering three centuries, the lists\r\ncomprise some four thousand titles, but this number includes a hundred\r\nand eight authors whose entire writings (under the entry of _Opera\r\nomnia_) came under condemnation. If the works of these writers were\r\nadded separately to the schedule, the titles would aggregate about\r\nfive thousand. Of these titles, some fifteen hundred belong to the\r\n17th century, twelve hundred to the 18th, and thirteen hundred to the\r\n19th; while from the publications of the last decade of the 19th have\r\nbeen selected but one hundred and thirty-one titles. This last group\r\nincludes, however, the _Opera omnia_ of Zola. The writers of the\r\n19th century who have been distinguished through the condemnation of\r\ntheir entire works comprise the following: Sue, 1852; Dumas (father\r\nand son), 1863; Sand (Dudévant), 1863; Balzac, 1864; Champfleury\r\n(Fleury-Husson), 1864; Feydeau, 1864; Murger, 1864; Soulié, 1864; Hume\r\n(David), 1827; Morado, 1821; Plancy, 1827; Proudhon, 1852; Spaventa,\r\n1856; Vira, 1876; Ferrari, 1879; Zola, 1895.\r\n\r\nThe omission from the Leonine Index of a long list of names, which\r\nappeared in earlier Indexes connected with the term _Opera omnia_,\r\nis to be understood as giving permission to the faithful for the\r\nuse of such books of these writers as do not appear under specific\r\ncondemnation or as cannot at once be classed under the general\r\nprohibitions. All of the books of writers of this first class which\r\ndo not antagonise either the true Faith or good morality are now free\r\nfor Catholic readers. This exception would of course continue to rule\r\nout the writings of the leaders of the original Reformation, Luther,\r\nCalvin, Melanchthon, and the rest, although the names of these writers\r\ndo not find place in the Leonine lists. The Index of Benedict (who\r\nfrom the liberal character of his convictions and policy was sometimes\r\nspoken of as the free-thinking Pope) strengthened the prohibitions\r\nagainst some fifty authors. The names of these authors, which had\r\npreviously been connected only with specific books, are entered in the\r\nIndex of 1758 with _Opera omnia_. Hilgers emphasises the greater\r\nliberality of Leo XIII in recalling these authors from the _Opera\r\nomnia_ classification and in leaving condemned only certain specific\r\nworks. He gives as another example of the liberality of Leo the freeing\r\nfrom condemnation of the famous treatise by Grotius, _De Jure Belli\r\nac Pacis_. This had previously been condemned with a _d.c._ but\r\nthe objectionable portions had never been specified and no corrected\r\nedition had ever been attempted. Another work of this class, previously\r\ncondemned but now left free by Leo, is the _Paradise Lost_ of\r\nMilton, and a third author whose condemnation has in like manner been\r\ncancelled is Leibnitz.\r\n\r\nThe Index of Leo concerns itself, further, with the correction of\r\ncertain condemnations that had been made, under general decrees, of\r\nbooks having to do with questions that had finally been adjusted\r\nthrough some later utterances of the Church. In 1661, Alexander VII\r\nhad condemned in a general decree all writings having to do with\r\n(either for question or for defence) the doctrine of the Immaculate\r\nConception. In 1854, this doctrine was accepted by the Church as a\r\ndogma and the decree of Alexander was thereby cancelled. The Index of\r\nLeo recalls the prohibition of the books previously condemned which had\r\ndefended the doctrine.\r\n\r\nThe great number of Italian books which swell, in the Leonine Index,\r\nthe list of modern publications, are very largely concerned with the\r\nissues, that have been fought over and that are not yet adjusted, which\r\narose from the development of the Kingdom of Italy. The condemnation\r\nin 1871 of two essays by Lord Acton was due to the approval given\r\nby Acton to the doctrines of the group of Catholic reformers led by\r\nDöllinger. The comparatively small selection that has been made in this\r\nIndex and in those that more immediately preceded it of works from the\r\ncountries outside of Italy was due to the fact that the examiners of\r\nthe Congregation have felt under responsibility to pass upon only those\r\nbooks which were directly brought to their attention.\r\n\r\n   “The Index,” says Hilgers, “has never given consideration to\r\n   the person or authority of the author. The decision has always\r\n   been arrived at purely on the basis of the influence, bad or\r\n   good, of the book. It has not hesitated to condemn utterances\r\n   of the theological faculty of the University of Paris on the\r\n   one hand, or acts of the Parliament of Paris on the other. It\r\n   was ready to condemn ordinances of Duke Leopold I of Lorraine,\r\n   the treatises of James I of England, and the works of the\r\n   ‘Philosopher of Sans-Souci.’ It would be difficult in fact to\r\n   contend that the material contained in these last was not likely\r\n   to exert a pernicious influence. The royal writer of Sans-Souci\r\n   scoffs at the immortality of the soul and, with his leader\r\n   Voltaire, defends a religious nihilism. He who is concerned\r\n   with maintenance whether of the throne, the altar, or the State,\r\n   who feels a responsibility for the welfare of the people, will\r\n   hardly guide his actions by the philosopher Voltaire.”[168]\r\n\r\nIn December, 1901, a journal printed in Rome for English-speaking\r\nreaders, under the title of the _Roman World_, prints the following\r\ncomment on the Index of Leo, a copy of which had, as the writer of the\r\narticle reports, been placed in his hands by a book collector of New\r\nYork:\r\n\r\n   “One of the great book collectors of New York has recently\r\n   secured from his foreign agent a copy of the new edition of the\r\n   Index _Librorum prohibitorum_ issued under the directions\r\n   of Leo XIII. It is seldom that a copy of an official Index\r\n   or record of books, the perusal of which is prohibited to\r\n   Catholics, comes into the hands of an outsider. The copies\r\n   printed are reserved for the use of the readers of the Church.\r\n   It is necessary in order to secure a copy, to pay a high price.\r\n   This particular copy, for instance, was estimated as worth from\r\n   $40 to $50, while a little later, in connection with the greater\r\n   difficulty of securing copies, it might easily have cost $400.\r\n   The history of the famous Index is interesting. Its intellectual\r\n   originator was the Emperor Charles V of Spain whose production\r\n   bears date about 1550. In 1554, the Pope Paul IV took into his\r\n   own hands the matter of the supervision of literature. This\r\n   has since been retained under the direct control of the pope.\r\n   Many hundreds of books which are not specified and mentioned in\r\n   the catalogue are prohibited under the general decrees, which\r\n   decrees, first issued by Benedict XIV in 1744, from that date on\r\n   are repeated in the succeeding Indexes. It is well known that no\r\n   Catholic ventures, under penalty of excommunication, to possess\r\n   or read books which are contained in the Index unless he may\r\n   secure a specific privilege or permission. It is not so well\r\n   known that the catalogue is itself three centuries old and that\r\n   it contains thus far the name of no single American writer, not\r\n   even Thomas Paine or Robert Ingersoll. There are, however, in\r\n   the lists dozens of works of the English classics and hundreds\r\n   of French books which belong to the world’s classics. Here for\r\n   instance are to be found Bossuet and Pascal. The latter always\r\n   believed himself to be a good Catholic. Among the English\r\n   names placed under the ban are Gibbon, Hume, Hallam, and\r\n   Goldsmith.”[169]\r\n\r\nHilgers amuses himself, and with justice, with the mass of errors that\r\nhave been crowded into the few paragraphs cited from the article. It is\r\nhis conclusion that if an American writing in the city of Rome could be\r\nso thoroughly ignorant of matters that were easily within his reach,\r\nthe impressions of Americans elsewhere and of Protestants generally\r\nconcerning the purpose, the history, and the nature of the Index are\r\nprobably equally erroneous.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions of the German Jesuit concerning the literary policy of\r\nthe Church of Rome as expressed in its latest Index, may conveniently\r\nbe supplemented by a statement (written in November, 1898) by a\r\nscholarly American priest, on the present policy and methods of the\r\nRoman censorship. This statement comes in a personal letter to myself\r\nand I am, therefore, not at liberty to bring into print the name of the\r\nwriter.\r\n\r\n   “The action of the Index is meant to be both preventive and\r\n   repressive. Its preventive action is exercised through the\r\n   diocesan censor, that is, there is in every well constituted\r\n   diocese an officer known as the _censor deputatus_, to whom\r\n   the bishop can hand over, before they come into print, all\r\n   works written by Catholics which deal with religion or morals.\r\n   This officer gives his opinion in writing to the bishop, who\r\n   thereby issues an _imprimatur_ (permission) or a _nihil\r\n   obstat_ (no reason to the contrary). There is, moreover, at\r\n   Rome a similar censorship on a somewhat wider scale which is\r\n   to-day, as through the past centuries, exercised through the\r\n   master of the sacred palace. This official continues to be a\r\n   Dominican friar. The greater part of the works submitted to this\r\n   censor are of course books printed in the city of Rome or at\r\n   least within the territory of the old papal States.\r\n\r\n   “As far as the repressive action of the Index is concerned, this\r\n   is performed by the Congregation itself. I may recall, however,\r\n   that at the Council of the Vatican, many bishops from France,\r\n   Germany, and Italy asked that the ‘Ten Rules of the Index’ be\r\n   revised. They asserted that the changed social and literary\r\n   conditions in these countries made it impossible to continue to\r\n   enforce these ‘Rules’ with the former strictness. The further\r\n   request was made public that books should no longer be censured\r\n   (condemned) at Rome until the local episcopal authorities had\r\n   been heard in the matter so that the author might have his\r\n   errors pointed out, and that, if he were writing in good faith,\r\n   he might thus be afforded an opportunity of recalling his\r\n   erroneous statements and thus save himself from the disgrace\r\n   that from a Catholic point of view would of necessity have come\r\n   upon him through the condemnation of his book. The text of\r\n   this document may be found in the _Acta Sacrorum Conciliorum\r\n   Recentiorum, Collectio Lacensis_, volume viii, 843–844.\r\n   On pages 11, 79, and 780 will be found a petition of certain\r\n   Catholic laymen for the abrogation of the Index.\r\n\r\n   “The application of the legislation of the Index is made by\r\n   the refusal of the permission to print, or by condemnation\r\n   of the printed book and the insertion of its title on the\r\n   catalogue of prohibited books. This latter act is accomplished\r\n   by means of special decrees in which one or more works may be\r\n   specified.... As far as the positive legislation of the Index\r\n   goes, it may be said that this is, as a matter of principle,\r\n   everywhere obligatory in that it emanates from the supreme\r\n   ecclesiastical authority. Nevertheless, it may in certain places\r\n   be modified by use or by non-use. Sometimes it is not strictly\r\n   applied or insisted upon; still, it does not lose its binding\r\n   force although the consciences of Catholics may thereby to some\r\n   extent be relieved. In certain countries, and undoubtedly in\r\n   English-speaking countries, the Index legislation has not been\r\n   strictly observed. I must say, however, that within the last\r\n   year (1898) a formal enquiry having been sent to the Roman\r\n   authorities as to whether in these English-speaking countries\r\n   the legislation of the Index was to be considered as in force,\r\n   an affirmative reply was returned to the questioners.\r\n\r\n   “Publishers and booksellers, if they be Catholics, are in\r\n   like manner bound to the observance of this ecclesiastical\r\n   legislation. Inasmuch as the legislation is preventive, it\r\n   is looked upon by them as a security and moreover in general\r\n   it offers a _présomption d’innocuité_ [presumption of\r\n   innocuousness] to the book, which is of importance for those\r\n   who furnish the capital for its publication. [This remark of\r\n   the American Father is, it may be pointed out, in line with\r\n   the conclusion submitted sixty years earlier by the Englishman\r\n   Mendham to the effect that if a book were not included in an\r\n   Index of its period, those interested in its publication had\r\n   a right to assume that it contained nothing considered as\r\n   objectionable by the authorities of the Church.]\r\n\r\n   “The repressive action of the Index may of course from time to\r\n   time occasion losses to writers, publishers, and to booksellers.\r\n   An author whose book has been placed upon the Index is under\r\n   obligation to withdraw the book from circulation or to modify\r\n   its text. [It is of course the case, although the Father does\r\n   not mention it, that any modification of the text of the\r\n   original edition calls for the cancellation of the copies of\r\n   this edition and involves the outlay of printing further copies\r\n   with the revised text]. Publishers and booksellers, if they be\r\n   Catholics, are bound, as is the author, by the action of the\r\n   Index authorities. If they be not Catholics and do not pay any\r\n   attention to ecclesiastical legislation, they may still, in\r\n   case the work has been written by a Catholic and is addressed\r\n   to a Catholic reading public, expect to see its sale blocked or\r\n   diminished through the censorship....\r\n\r\n   “It may be said in general that the Index legislation, as\r\n   formulated by Leo XIII, is no longer as severe as formerly;\r\n   it has been modified in the sense of mitigation. For example,\r\n   a book written by an American for the purpose of education or\r\n   instruction for instance in the Scriptures, is no longer _ipso\r\n   facto_ forbidden. As far as the Index is concerned, such\r\n   books may be freely read by Catholics who may need them.... The\r\n   famous ‘Ten Rules’ of the Index issued under the authority of\r\n   Pius IV (1564) are to be interpreted to-day by the Constitution\r\n   ‘_Apostolicae Sedis_’ issued by Pius IX, a Constitution\r\n   which reformed considerably the well-known system of censures,\r\n   excommunication, and the like, and which is to-day the juridical\r\n   source of general ecclesiastical censures of all kinds. In the\r\n   _Compendium Juris Ecclesiastici ad usum cleri_, written by\r\n   the Austrian Bishop, Simon Archner, Bishop of Brixen, (the sixth\r\n   edition of which was printed in 1887), you will find (on page\r\n   521) the following passage:\r\n\r\n   “‘The ecclesiastical prohibition of books, whether placed\r\n   _nominatim_ on the Index or forbidden by its general rules,\r\n   whether forbidden by the natural law or by the positive law,\r\n   remains still intact. Therefore, such prohibited books cannot\r\n   be printed, read, or kept _sine peccato_. But, at the same\r\n   time, certain modifications of these prohibitions remain also\r\n   in force, modifications which have doubtless been introduced\r\n   in various regions through legitimate custom. As to Germany,\r\n   authors of authority mentioned by the Council of Vienna have\r\n   maintained that profane books written by heretics, on special\r\n   subjects, as law, medicine, philosophy, history, etc., although\r\n   they may contain one or more heresies scattered throughout the\r\n   text, heresies held by the authors _obiter tantum_, do not\r\n   fall under the ecclesiastical prohibition. They say the same\r\n   of those writings of Catholic authors, otherwise worthy books,\r\n   which contain one or more doctrines that are not entirely in\r\n   accord with Catholic theology, the sacred canons, and the\r\n   constitutions of the popes, and which in certain matters may\r\n   exceed the proper limits in comment on subjects that the\r\n   writers ought not to touch. This moderation is extended also\r\n   to the rules of the Index which are scarcely anywhere received\r\n   in their entirety, and which still less can be republished in\r\n   this century _ex integro_. Finally, in Germany, even those\r\n   writings of non-Catholics may, generally speaking, be safely\r\n   read by Catholics which speak of religious matters in a manner\r\n   conformable to the doctrine of the Church; and especially is\r\n   this the case with the works of writers who may seem to be\r\n   nearing conversion to the Catholic religion. On the other hand,\r\n   no such license can be given to writings which treat of obscene\r\n   matter, superstitions, magic, incantations, and the like; such\r\n   works, even though written by Catholics, are forbidden in\r\n   Germany, and rightly so. It is further to be noted that even\r\n   bishops can issue and are under obligations to issue positive\r\n   precepts by which, even under pain of censure, they may forbid\r\n   the reading of books if they are satisfied that such reading\r\n   would bring danger of perversion. In such case, they will\r\n   declare that the reading of the works in question is forbidden\r\n   under the law of nature. In regard to this point, Pius IX on the\r\n   24th of August, 1868, renewed the injunction of Leo XII, urging\r\n   the bishops to proceed in this matter not only by their own\r\n   episcopal rights but also as delegates of the Apostolic See.’\r\n\r\n   “The work of the Congregation of the Index is continued at Rome\r\n   practically under the same routine as in former centuries,\r\n   modified only by the late legislation of Leo XIII.... The\r\n   prohibitions of the Index are, as a rule, made known by being\r\n   published in the _Osservatore Romano_. I am not able to say\r\n   how the individual author learns of the condemnation of his work\r\n   and whether it is customary to write a letter to the bishop of\r\n   his diocese or whether the publication in the _Osservatore_\r\n   is looked upon as sufficient; nor can I say whether there is\r\n   any earlier or more juridical means of promulgation than that\r\n   mentioned. As a matter of fact, such condemnations are first\r\n   more widely published by means of the Catholic press; but there\r\n   is no law or usage compelling further publicity than that\r\n   specified. Indeed, I doubt whether the fact of the condemnation\r\n   of a book by a decree, or the fact that it has been placed on\r\n   the Index, is always known to the Catholic world in general or\r\n   even to those Catholics who speak the language in which the book\r\n   is printed.... It may be well to remember that, in practice,\r\n   the condemnations of the Index probably affect very much less\r\n   than is generally imagined the actual sale or distribution\r\n   of the books condemned; partly because of ignorance of the\r\n   condemnation, which is often very general, partly because of\r\n   the accepted and increasing modification of the legislation,\r\n   and partly because the persons for whom such books were chiefly\r\n   intended are often by privilege or by dispensation provided with\r\n   the authority to read the same.”\r\n\r\nAt the time of the completion of the proof-reading of this division of\r\nmy treatise (March 1907), there does not appear to be any prospect of\r\nthe production, under the direction of Pius X, of any later issue of\r\nthe Index. Books that are brought to the attention of the Secretary\r\nof the Congregation, or of the Master of the Palace, are, however,\r\ncondemned from time to time by separate decrees. Among other recent\r\nsimilar condemnations, may be cited: Schell, Hermann (of Wurzburg),\r\n_Treatise on Catholicism_, (and three other works) 1899. Loisy, the\r\nAbbé, _L’Évangile et l’Église_, 1903. Horitin, the Abbé, _La Question\r\nBiblique chez les Catholiques_, etc., 1903.\r\n\r\nThe writings of these three authors gave rise to fierce controversies\r\nduring the years between 1898 and 1903. Schell and Loisy submitted\r\nthemselves. The treatise by Ehrhart, _Catholicism and the Twentieth\r\nCentury_, published in 1901, and that by the Protestant, Harnack,\r\n_What is Christianity_, published in 1900, escaped condemnation. In\r\nJuly, 1906, a condemnation was made of _The Saint_ (_Il Santo_) by\r\nSenator Antonio Fogazzaro. The author, who is reported to be a devout\r\nCatholic, is said to have “submitted himself” in regular course, but\r\nhis submission could not prevent the continued sale of the book in the\r\nItalian as well as in the foreign editions.\r\n\r\nI am informed by the publishers of the American edition that the\r\nprohibition by the Roman authorities was duly respected by the\r\npublishers of the leading Catholic papers of America, which declined to\r\naccept advertisements of the book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n            THE AUTHORITY AND THE RESULTS OF THE CENSORSHIP\r\n             OF THE CHURCH--SCHEDULE OF INDEXES, 1526–1900\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the earlier periods of the Index, the Curia had, in form at least,\r\ntaken the ground that the prohibitions and condemnations as published\r\nin Rome were, without further action, to be held as binding upon\r\nall the countries in which the Church itself was recognised. This\r\ncontention, as has already been noted, failed to secure acceptance\r\nin countries like France, Spain, Germany, and Belgium. In fact even\r\nin certain divisions of Italy, and conspicuously in Venice, the\r\nregulations of the Index were put into force only if, and when, the\r\nlocal authorities had confirmed the same. During the latter half of the\r\n19th century, however, there came to be a change in the nature of the\r\nconsideration given in Catholic countries to the censorship regulations\r\nof Rome. A series of provincial councils and a number of theologians\r\nand divines have taken the ground that the Index decrees were entitled\r\nto general acceptance and should be enforced with uniformity throughout\r\nall Catholic States. The protests and controversial opinions in regard\r\nto the condemnation or supervision of literature which, during the 17th\r\nand 18th centuries, had been so frequent had during these later decades\r\nbecome more and more exceptional. These earlier protests concerning\r\ncertain individual books or individual writers developed, as we have\r\nseen, in quite a number of instances into general controversies,\r\ncontroversies many of which had an abiding influence on the opinions\r\nof believers and on the final policy of the Church. We may recall in\r\nthis connection the results that arose through the action of the Roman\r\nauthorities in regard to the works of such writers as the Jesuits Poza\r\nand Daniel, the Dominican Serry, the Jansenists Arnauld and Quesnel,\r\nthe liberal Churchman Fénelon, etc.\r\n\r\nIt appears to-day to be the general practice in Catholic circles to\r\nspeak of the purpose and operations of the Index with a fair measure of\r\nrespect, and the authors of this later period permit themselves even\r\nto give specific commendation to the work of the Church in supervising\r\nand controlling, for the use of the faithful, the character of literary\r\nproductions. Curiously enough, side by side with this increasing\r\nrespect for the institution, or at least with the very considerable\r\nlessening of criticisms, protest, and antagonism against the working\r\nof the institution, there is evidence of an increasing ignorance of\r\nthe details of the regulations of the later Indexes, those that are\r\nsupposed at this time to be in force. The scholarly divines of the\r\nlatter years of the last century had in not a few instances given\r\nevidence that they were by no means familiar with the present Index\r\nregulations or with the lists of books placed under condemnation.\r\nAs late as 1890, Bishop Rass brought into print in Rome a volume by\r\nJustus Lipsius which had been condemned in two preceding Indexes;\r\nduring the same period, Bishop Malou caused a new edition to be\r\nprinted of a prohibited work. The vicar-general of Lorenzi printed\r\nin 1883 a treatise by Geiler von Keisersberg, oblivious of the fact\r\nthat the name of the author remains in the first class of the Index.\r\nIt is probably the case that there is under present conditions no\r\nsuch constant reference to the Index lists as guides for reading and\r\nfor study as could secure for their regulations the authority which\r\nproperly belongs to them under the theory of Church control. It is\r\na question for the casuist to decide how far ignorance of the fact\r\nof condemnation of a book may serve as an extenuation of the sin of\r\nreading a volume, for which sin the penalty has been prescribed in\r\nsuccessive Indexes of excommunication _latae sententiae_.\r\n\r\nIn 1862, under decision of the Quinquennial faculties, it was ordered\r\nthat bishops had authority to extend permission for the reading of\r\nprohibited books only to priests who were actually engaged in the\r\ncare of souls. Laymen desiring to secure such permission must make\r\napplication direct to the Holy See. This is in line with the order\r\nissued, in 1853, by the Congregation of the Index under which the\r\nUltramontane bishops had authority to extend to ecclesiastics of\r\nassured scholarship and piety permission to utilise, during their\r\nlifetime, prohibited books having to do with matters of religion and\r\ndoctrine; but no such permission could be given for books _contra\r\nbonos mores_. In every permission issued by a bishop it must be\r\nspecifically stated that the authority comes from the Holy See.\r\n\r\nAfter the middle of the 19th century, there began to be a change in\r\nthe relations of the ecclesiastics of France to the authority of\r\nthe Index. In _La Revue Ecclésiastique_, an article printed in 1866\r\nsays: “If, twenty years back, the question had been put as to whether\r\nthe authority of the Index was recognised in France, the answer\r\nwould simply have been a laugh or a word in derision. To-day, such\r\nrecognition is assented to without serious question. The formula _Index\r\nnon viget in Gallia_, heretofore printed in books the titles of which\r\nhad come upon the Roman Index, is now no longer to be seen.” Councils\r\nof the 19th century of the French Church in which the authority of\r\nthe Roman Inquisition or of the Congregation of the Index to control\r\nliterature in France had been accepted in substance, as cited in this\r\narticle, are these: Paris and Rennes, 1849, Lyons and Clairmont, 1850,\r\nAvignon, 1849, Albi, Toulouse, Bordeaux, and Sens, 1850, La Rochelle,\r\n1853, and Rheims, 1857.\r\n\r\nAmong the councils of this period, outside of France, which placed\r\nthemselves on record as specifically accepting the authority of the\r\nIndex, are those of Prague, 1860, Colocsa, 1863, Utrecht, 1865. A\r\ncouncil held in Venice, in 1859, orders that the Roman prohibitions are\r\nfrom year to year to be printed in a diocesan calendar. This is a very\r\ndifferent attitude from that taken by Venice during the 17th and 18th\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nIn 1852, Bishop Baillès of Luçon writes in a pastoral instruction:\r\n“The prohibition of a book by the Holy See is binding upon believers\r\nthroughout the Church universal. The lists issued by the authorities\r\nof Rome of condemned and prohibited books are securing from year to\r\nyear a fuller authority and a wider recognition.... Only heretics,\r\nschismatics, and Gallicans at this time contest the general authority\r\nof the Index.”\r\n\r\nIn Germany, the world-wide authority of the Index is asserted by such\r\ncritics as Heymans and Phillips in their treatise on ecclesiastical law\r\n(issued in 1872) and by the editors of the Münster _Pastoral Blatt_,\r\nwriting in 1879. A modified view is expressed by the editor of the\r\n_Katholik_, writing in 1859, who says: “The Index, considered as a\r\nmoral law, is to be accepted as authoritative throughout the world.\r\nThere may be ground for question, however, as to the general obligation\r\nto accept its penal regulations.” A little later, however, the editor\r\nof the _Katholik_, writing in 1864, says:\r\n\r\n   “The faithful throughout the world are under obligations\r\n   to accept the authority of the censorship tribunals, the\r\n   Inquisition and the Congregation of the Index, not only in\r\n   regard to the prohibition of the use of prohibited books but\r\n   also with reference to the conclusions reached by these censors\r\n   concerning the soundness of doctrine or general fitness for\r\n   devout reading of the literature contained in such books....\r\n   The history of the Church has secured for the wisdom of the\r\n   work of the censorship authorities an assured, even a brilliant\r\n   confirmation.” “The only utterance,” continues this writer,\r\n   “in which the Congregation of the Index can be convicted of a\r\n   serious or decisive error of judgment is that of the decree\r\n   issued in 1616 against the writings of Copernicus.... While the\r\n   history makes clear (what in fact no one has ever denied) that\r\n   the Roman Congregations are in their judgments not infallible,\r\n   the evidence is overwhelming as to the wisdom and effectiveness\r\n   with which the work of these scholarly and devout censors has\r\n   been carried on through the centuries; and it would be an act\r\n   of very gross presumption for individual believers to undertake\r\n   to question the validity and substantial value of their\r\n   conclusions.”\r\n\r\nIn 1865, an article in the official _Civiltà Cattolica_[170] in\r\nregard to a treatise of the Bishop of Treviso, says:\r\n\r\n   “The infallibility of a prohibition or condemnation of a book\r\n   which has been expressed through a papal Bull, a papal brief,\r\n   or under a decree of the Congregation which has been issued\r\n   under specific instructions from the pope, cannot be questioned.\r\n   The ordinary decrees of the Congregation cannot be said to\r\n   possess the same full measure of infallibility as these rest\r\n   not upon the direct authority of the pope but merely upon\r\n   the general authority under which the Congregation has been\r\n   constituted. A book that has been condemned by the Congregation\r\n   must, however, be considered as having been condemned by the\r\n   Church of which the Congregation is for this purpose the\r\n   authorised representative.”\r\n\r\nAs before pointed out, the influence of the Dominicans in the\r\noperations of the Congregation of the Index has been continuous and all\r\npowerful. As a result, the theological writers whose books have been\r\ncondemned included a large proportion of Jesuits, and the literature\r\npresenting Jesuit doctrines has from the outset been handled with\r\nspecial severity. In the cases in which occasion has been found for\r\nreproving the books of Dominican authors, the censorship has been\r\ncomparatively mild, and if the books were prohibited, the entry was\r\nusually made with the reservation _d.c._[171] Father Hilgers, of the\r\nOrder of the Jesuits in Germany, whose treatise on the Index (issued\r\nin 1905) is referred to elsewhere, is one of the few of the scholarly\r\nJesuits who have found it practicable to take a favourable view of the\r\npolicy of the Index. The Jansenist view of the authority of the Index\r\nhas not unnaturally been still less approving than that of the Jesuits.\r\nAmauld, for instance, writing in 1656, says:\r\n\r\n   “In France we do not trouble ourselves very much concerning the\r\n   censures of the Index.... We know on what grounds certain of\r\n   the condemnations have been arrived at. It is assuredly true\r\n   that the prohibition of a work constitutes no evidence that it\r\n   is really pernicious.... If a pope who has such devout purposes\r\n   as characterised Innocent XI, in coming under the evil practice\r\n   of Rome, finds it impossible to avoid the condemnation of really\r\n   devout and scholarly books, it is easy to understand what the\r\n   results of censorship must be when the authority comes into the\r\n   hands of popes who are less pious and less fair-minded.... One\r\n   may await only bad results from the book censorship of Rome so\r\n   long as the practice obtains of listening only to those who\r\n   denounce the books and of giving no opportunity to the authors\r\n   themselves to make clear the writing or precise character of\r\n   their text. In this way it has come about that books of most\r\n   importance for scholarship and of religion have been condemned\r\n   and cancelled on the ground of two or three sentences which have\r\n   failed to be understood by careless or unscholarly examiners.”\r\n\r\nWriting again in 1693, under Innocent XII, Arnauld says:\r\n\r\n   “Our good Pope is labouring in praiseworthy manner for the\r\n   abolition of abuses. He has, however, not yet realised that one\r\n   of the reforms most called for is to avoid appointing as members\r\n   of the Inquisition cardinals who have no more trustworthy\r\n   knowledge of the matters there to be considered than a shoemaker\r\n   has of astronomy. The ‘qualificators’ (the examining scholars)\r\n   have only a vote for counsel. It is with the cardinals that\r\n   rest the deciding votes and these unfortunately are not weighed\r\n   but simply counted. How many and serious have been the blunders\r\n   committed through decisions of the Inquisition (or of the\r\n   Congregation) in matters of doctrine of which the majority of\r\n   the cardinals are frankly ignorant!”\r\n\r\nAs an example, on the other hand, of an unquestioning acceptance of\r\nthe wisdom and authority of the Church in this matter of censorship,\r\nmay be cited St. Francis of Sales, who writes (in 1608):\r\n\r\n   “We pray our Catholic readers, in order to protect themselves\r\n   from the contagion of evil influences, to accept without\r\n   question the book prohibitions of the Holy Church. We may say\r\n   that we ourselves have always given the strictest obedience to\r\n   the Church regulations in regard to the reading of condemned\r\n   books. In no other way can we manifest the full honour in which\r\n   we hold its authority and our obligations as believers to accept\r\n   this authority.”[172]\r\n\r\nMacchiavelli (writing about 1500) observes that if the princes of the\r\nChristian States had maintained religion in the form in which it was\r\ndelivered by its Founder, these States would be more united and happier\r\nthan they are. He adds, _ne se può fare altra maggiore conjettura\r\ndella declinatione d’essa, quanto è vedere come quelli popoli che sono\r\npiù propinqui alla Chiesa Romana, capo della Religione nostra, hanno\r\nmeno Religione. Et chi considerasse i fondamenti suoi, e vedesse l’uso\r\npresente quanto è diverso da quelli, giudicherebbe esser propinquo\r\nsenza dubbio, ò la rovina ò il flagello. Habbiamo adunque con la Chiesa\r\ne coi Preti noi Italiani questo primo obligo, d’essere diventati senza\r\nReligione e cattivi_, which Mendham interprets, “the more of Rome,\r\nthe less of religion.”[173]\r\n\r\nSir Edwin Sandys, whose _Europae Speculum_, printed at The Hague\r\nin 1629, was translated (from English) into Latin by Francus, gives in\r\nthis a summary of the literary policy of the Church of his time. He\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n   “But the Papacy at this day, taught by woful experience what\r\n   damage this license of writing among themselves hath done them\r\n   and that their speeches are not only weapons in the hands of\r\n   their adversaries, but eyesores and stumbling blocks also to\r\n   their remaining friends; under show of purging the world from\r\n   the infection of all wicked and corrupt books and passages\r\n   which are either against religion or against honesty and good\r\n   manners, for which two purposes they have several officers who\r\n   indeed do blot out much impiousness and filth, and therein well\r\n   deserve both to be commended and imitated (whereto the Venetians\r\n   add also a third, to let nothing pass that may be justly\r\n   offensive to princes), have in truth withal pared and lopped off\r\n   whatsoever in a manner their watchful eyes could observe, either\r\n   free in disclosing their drifts and practices, or dishonourable\r\n   to the clergy, or undutiful to the Papacy. These editions only\r\n   authorised, all other are disallowed, called in, censured;\r\n   with threats to whosoever shall presume to keep them; that no\r\n   speech, no writing, no evidence of times past, no discourse of\r\n   things present, in sum, nothing whatsoever may sound aught but\r\n   holiness, honour, purity, integrity to the unspotted spouse of\r\n   Christ and to his unerring Vicar; to the Mistress of Churches,\r\n   to the Father of Princes ... and they brought forth in fine\r\n   those _Indices Expurgatorii_ whereof I suppose they are\r\n   now not a little ashamed, they having by misfortune lit into\r\n   their adversaries’ hands from whom they desired by all means to\r\n   conceal them.”[174]\r\n\r\nD’Aguesseau, in a _Mémoire_ written in 1710, says: “It is well\r\nunderstood that the Index possesses in France no authority. It is sad\r\nto understand that it is still permitted to control literature in\r\ncertain countries which have not known, as has France, how to uphold\r\nthe freedom of a national Church. The Index has in fact been so misused\r\nas a power that it makes prohibition of not a few books which are by\r\nno means deserving of so much honour.”\r\n\r\nIn an essay by Villers on the _Spirit and Influence of the\r\nReformation of Luther_ (which obtained the prize offered in 1802 by\r\nthe French Institute for the best treatise on the question) the author\r\nfinds ground for no little indignation concerning the restrictions upon\r\nbooks by a pope who, while issuing fulminations against Luther, gave\r\nfull license to Ariosto. The writer goes on to say:\r\n\r\n   “In Spain, in Italy, and in Austria, the prohibitions and\r\n   censures went much further, and in those countries heavy\r\n   shackles have been imposed on the liberty of writing and of\r\n   thinking.” The writer complains that “in public libraries\r\n   in these countries, the works of Rousseau, of Voltaire, of\r\n   Helvetius, of Diderot, and of other _esprits forts_, are\r\n   kept under lock and key with the order that they shall not be\r\n   communicated to any persons excepting to those who shall engage\r\n   to refute their doctrines.”\r\n\r\nHe makes reference to the dismissal from office, in 1780, of a\r\nprofessor of a Bavarian university who had requested that a copy of\r\nBayle’s _Critical Dictionary_ should be placed in the common library.\r\n\r\n   “In those countries is still maintained as far as possible the\r\n   policy of the Middle Ages, under which the minds of men are to\r\n   be kept on certain subjects in complete stupidity or in a state\r\n   of emptiness so that they may later be filled with convenient\r\n   doctrine or may be kept free for superstition.[175]\r\n\r\nMendham points out that\r\n\r\n   “It is not going beyond the truth to say that an almost\r\n   perfect library might be formed from the books condemned by the\r\n   papal Indexes, perfect indeed for all purposes of absolute and\r\n   abundant utility. It would need only to have added to it a few\r\n   Benedictine editions of the Fathers, histories and accounts of\r\n   modern Roman affairs and the collection of the Bulls, Councils,\r\n   etc.... It would also be somewhat lacking in English books,\r\n   prolific as this island is in offensive and formidable heresy.\r\n   The fact is, that the literary productions of England have\r\n   come into contact or collision with the Italian only by means\r\n   of translations. It is in this that we find in the Indexes the\r\n   works of Swift, Tillotson, Sherlock, Robertson, Gibbon, and\r\n   others.... There is a further detail, that these prohibitory\r\n   and expurgatory instruments could only be put into execution\r\n   among subjects of papal government.... Any attempt to enforce\r\n   them in other States would have provoked hostilities with their\r\n   heretical community with no prospect of advantage and with much\r\n   risk of disadvantage to the Roman power.”[176]\r\n\r\nMendham contends that under the general policy of the Church, as\r\nexpressed in its Indexes, the inference is legitimate that what the\r\nIndexes do not condemn they approve and sanction. It therefore follows\r\nthat the authority from which those Indexes issue (an authority which\r\nis the highest in the Church) must be understood as approving and even\r\nsanctioning all doctrines or assertions presented by writers of her own\r\ncommunion which her condemning decrees have failed either to proscribe\r\nor to expurgate. (This contention is, it must be remembered, denied\r\nabsolutely by the Jesuit Hilgers, writing in 1905.) In the examination\r\nheld in 1825 on the state of Ireland, the Rev. M. O’Sullivan stated\r\nin one of his answers that in the case of an author of authority,\r\nsuch as Cardinal Bellarmin, the omission of criticism on the part\r\nof the authorities amounted to an approbation. The questioner drew\r\nthe immediate inference: “Then you understand by the Index, not only\r\na negative condemnation of all the books specified, but a positive\r\naffirmation of the doctrines or principles of all the books by Catholic\r\nwriters not condemned.” Against this inference the witness was reported\r\nas making no protest. With respect to Bellarmin, it may be noted that\r\nhis name was entered in the Index of Sixtus V because he had failed to\r\naffirm the direct power of the pope in matters temporal, an entry which\r\nmay be considered as supporting the above inference.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ignorance of the Indexes]\r\n\r\nThat the works appearing under the form of Indexes, catalogues, etc.,\r\nhowever various, still all belonging to, or coming from, Rome, are\r\nat least uncommon and extensively unknown, requires no proof more\r\nelaborate or unquestionable than the not only ready but forward\r\ndeclaration of ignorance by the very persons who should be presumed\r\nto be best acquainted with them, by well informed members of the\r\necclesiastic community which promulgates and enforces them. Charles\r\nButler, writing in 1824, says: “Few of the Roman Catholics know of the\r\nexistence of the _Index expurgatorius_.”[177] Dr. Murray, the Roman\r\nCatholic Archbishop of Dublin, states before a committee of the House\r\nof Commons, in 1825:\r\n\r\n   “The _Index expurgatorius_ has no authority whatever\r\n   in Ireland; it has never been received in these countries\r\n   [_sic_] and I doubt very much whether there be ten people\r\n   in Ireland who have ever seen it; it is a sort of censorship of\r\n   books established in Rome and it is not even received in Spain,\r\n   where they have a censorship of their own. In these countries,\r\n   it has no force whatever.”[178]\r\n\r\nMendham trusts that “no equivocation lurks under the ambiguity of the\r\nepithet _expurgatorius_.”\r\n\r\nDr. Slevin, prefect of the College of Dunboyne, says (in 1826):\r\n\r\n“Our Catholics will respect the prohibitions of the Congregation of the\r\nIndex.”\r\n\r\nIn a work entitled _Church History of the English from the year\r\n1500_, published under the name of Dod, (according to Mendham the\r\nreal name of the author was Tootell), mention is made of a Council of\r\nReformation. In chapter ix, pages 94 and 95, an extract is given from\r\ncertain regulations framed by this council during the last decade of\r\nthe 16th century. The wording is as follows:\r\n\r\n   “Publick and private libraries must be searched and examined\r\n   for books, as also all bookbinders, stationers and booksellers’\r\n   shops; and not only Heretical Books and Pamphlets but also\r\n   prophane, vane, lascivious and other such hurtful and dangerous\r\n   poysons, are utterly to be removed, burnt and suppressed, and\r\n   severe order and punishment appointed for such as shall conceal\r\n   these kind [_sic_] of Writing; and like order set down for\r\n   printing of good things for the time to come.”\r\n\r\n          *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   “The earlier editions of the Index expurgatory,” says Mendham,\r\n   “were distributed with the utmost caution and were intended only\r\n   for the possession and the inspection of those to whom they were\r\n   necessary for the execution of the provisions. The reason is\r\n   obvious. It certainly was little desirable that the dishonest\r\n   dealings with the authors here censured should be known, either\r\n   to those who were injured by them and to whom they would offer\r\n   the opportunity of justifying themselves; or to the world at\r\n   large whose judgment they must know would in many instances be\r\n   at variance with their own. And evidently it was not to their\r\n   interest to discover and to point out those very passages\r\n   and writings, not only of reputed heretics but of reputed\r\n   Catholics, which exposed the most vulnerable parts of their own\r\n   system.”[179]\r\n\r\n   “The _Indices Expurgatorii_ are very good commonplace\r\n   books and repertories, by help of which we may presently find,\r\n   what any author (who has fallen under censure) has against them\r\n   [_i.e._ the Catholics]. We are directed through the Index\r\n   to the book, chapter, and line, where anything is spoken against\r\n   any superstition or error of Rome; so that he who has the\r\n   _Indices_ cannot want for testimonies against Rome.”[180]\r\n\r\nIn an article printed in 1861, in the _Katholik_ of Mayence, the\r\nwriter says:\r\n\r\n   “We are prepared to place upon any inquirer the responsibility\r\n   of determining whether the Congregation of the Index in the\r\n   whole series of its operations has ever committed an essential\r\n   blunder.... The policy and method of ecclesiastical censorship\r\n   as carried out through the Index is the most moderate, the\r\n   most tolerant, and the wisest that could be conceived....\r\n   The Congregation of the Index secures in the shaping of its\r\n   judgments the service of the scholarship and of the consciences\r\n   and capable labour of wise and devout counsellors; and its\r\n   decisions may be accepted as the conclusions of a scientific\r\n   Areopagus which is entitled to the fullest respect and the most\r\n   implicit obedience; and he who does not render such obedience is\r\n   a stranger to, and an opponent of, the spirit of the Church.\r\n   ... It is through the Index that the Holy See exercises one of\r\n   the most important of its functions.”[181]\r\n\r\nIn 1868, in an article having to do with the Council of the Vatican,\r\nthe _Katholik_ says:\r\n\r\n   “The sting of the Index (to its critics) rests in this, that\r\n   it represents a judgment exercised by the highest authority in\r\n   matters of faith over individual knowledge. It is the sting of\r\n   infallible truth.... The Index has from the beginning been the\r\n   most trustworthy teacher of sound theology and defender of true\r\n   Faith.”\r\n\r\nBishop Baillès of Luçon, writing in 1864, says:\r\n\r\n   “The Index contains no single book the condemnation of which\r\n   was not arrived at under general rules.... It may be considered\r\n   as itself one great book in which are characterised with more\r\n   or less precision all the errors, heresies, and schisms of the\r\n   ages--a book which for all devout scholars may be accepted as\r\n   a trustworthy chart on which have been marked with a skilled\r\n   and trusted hand all sunken rocks and other perils of the deep.\r\n   The Index is the incomparable master work of the wisdom of\r\n   the Church.” Baillès says further: “No bibliographical work\r\n   can be considered as complete until it has been collated with\r\n   the Index.... The date of the prohibition of a book, taken in\r\n   connection with the date of its first publication, indicates the\r\n   time during which it has become more pernicious.... The Index is\r\n   to be classed as the most essential of critical bibliographies,\r\n   one which no library should be without.”\r\n\r\nBishop Plantier of Nismes, in a pastoral letter of 1857, describes the\r\nCongregation of the Index as “the throne of good sense, the magistracy\r\nof truth, and a tribunal each utterance of which constitutes an\r\nindispensable service to true philosophy.”[182]\r\n\r\nMinister Jules Ferry, speaking in the French Senate, May 31, 1882, says:\r\n\r\n   “We will never recognise the decrees of the Congregation of\r\n   the Index. We propose to maintain the traditions of the French\r\n   State and of the Gallic Church. Where would the State be if the\r\n   decisions of the body which has placed its interdict upon the\r\n   great spirits of mankind, such as Descartes, Malebranche, Kant,\r\n   Renan, and has even condemned the Dictionary of Bouillet, should\r\n   be accepted as the law of the land?... The ground that has been\r\n   assigned for the condemnation of the Handbook of Compayré was\r\n   the statement contained in it ‘that it was more important for\r\n   the French child to know the names of the Kings of France than\r\n   those of the Kings of Judea.’... The Index-decree went over the\r\n   head of the Ambassador in Rome and of the Nuncius in Paris, in\r\n   order to start a conflagration in our State.\r\n\r\n   “In a manual by André Berthet, published in 1882, (which did\r\n   _not_ find its way into the Index), stand the following\r\n   questions: ‘What is God? I know not. What becomes of us after\r\n   death? I know not. Are you not ashamed of your ignorance? One\r\n   need not be ashamed not to know what has not yet been known to\r\n   any one.’”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Church and Science]\r\n\r\nFather Searle (writing in 1895) maintains that the Church does\r\nnot prohibit Catholics who are competent to undertake scientific\r\ninvestigation, from so doing. She places absolutely no obstacle in the\r\nway of their penetrating into all the facts of nature as it stands or\r\nof their considering the probable indications as to its past history or\r\nof their weighing actual historical testimony.... The Church forbids,\r\nas against reason, common-sense, and the welfare of man, liberty of\r\nthought on matters, whether in the material or spiritual order, which\r\nhave been clearly demonstrated and definitely ascertained; she refuses\r\nto abandon it on those matters which are still open to reasonable\r\nquestion, as is the case with certain scientific hypotheses not as yet\r\nproven.[183]\r\n\r\nSuch a statement, if accepted to-day as authoritative, would make\r\nit evident that the policy of the Church in the 20th century has\r\nchanged very materially from the policy that was in force, with some\r\nstrenuousness, in the 16th and 17th centuries.\r\n\r\nHilgers points out that the Church is naturally much more concerned\r\nwith the protection of the morality and of the spiritual nature of the\r\npeople than with any formal intellectual development such as is to be\r\nsecured from the study of the so-called classics. If a classical work,\r\nfor instance, teaches that suicide is praiseworthy or is defensible,\r\nit is the duty of the Church to keep such work out of the hands of the\r\nbelievers. In like manner, the Church prohibits writings of any kind\r\nwhich make defence of the propriety of divorce or which make reference\r\nto divorce as if it were a necessary condition of society. The Church\r\ncan further give its approval either formally or tacitly to no work\r\nwhich attacks the inspiration of the Scriptures or the binding force of\r\nscriptural doctrine, and must bring its condemnation upon any writer,\r\nhowever great he may be, whether Catholic or Protestant, historian\r\nor litterateur, philosopher or theologian, whose utterances tend to\r\nundermine faith in the word of God.[184]\r\n\r\nThere are, however, not a few expressions of opinion from Catholic\r\nsources which are by no means in accord with the conclusions reached\r\nby Father Hilgers as to the wisdom and beneficence of the literary\r\npolicy of the Church of Rome. These critics have pointed out that\r\nthe censors, whether in Rome, Madrid, or Paris, had been so seriously\r\nconcerned with matters of doctrine, that they had given small measure\r\nof attention to publications of a scandalous character, and the\r\ninfluence of which was _contra bonos mores_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sleumer on the Index]\r\n\r\nA volume published in Osnabrück (Hanover) in August, 1906, may be\r\ncited as an example of cordial support given to the present censorship\r\npolicy of the Roman Church by a loyal Catholic of North Germany. The\r\nauthor is Albert Sleumer, Doctor of Philosophy, and his book, issued\r\nunder the title of _Index Romanus_, claims to present a complete\r\nrecord of all the German publications which have been placed upon the\r\nRoman Index, together with the titles of books other than German which\r\nhave been condemned since 1870. Dr. Sleumer’s volume is issued with\r\nthe approval of Hubert, Bishop of the historic diocese of Osnabrück.\r\nSleumer’s volume had been originally issued in 1901 and now appears in\r\na later revised edition. The contentions submitted by him in regard\r\nto the necessity of the Index, and as to the wisdom with which, from\r\nthe beginning, the censorship of the Church has been conducted, are\r\nsubstantially in line with the position taken by Father Hilgers, whose\r\nlarger and more important treatise has already been referred to.\r\nSleumer is, like Hilgers, interested in citing examples of censorship\r\nby the State which are less consistent in principle and more extreme in\r\napplication than similar actions by the authorities of Rome. He quotes,\r\nfor instance, Thiers (whom he describes as “a well-known, free-thinking\r\nauthor of France”) saying, in 1830, that there could be no danger to\r\nthe community in giving unrestricted freedom to the press.\r\n\r\n   “Truth alone,” says Thiers, “can have abiding influence; that\r\n   which is false can do no harm and in the end brings its own\r\n   refutation and no government can ever be injured by libellous\r\n   publications.”\r\n\r\nIn 1834, Thiers takes a different ground:\r\n\r\n   “The representatives of the People are having their influence\r\n   impaired by the falsifications of the Press.... The wickedness\r\n   and lack of responsibility on the part of the Press have brought\r\n   grave misfortunes upon the community.... It is essential for the\r\n   safety of the State that there should be a close supervision of\r\n   the Press.\r\n\r\nWe may remember that, between 1830 and 1834, the Bourbon government\r\nof Charles X had been overthrown and that Thiers was now a leader of\r\ninfluence under the administration of Louis Philippe.\r\n\r\nSleumer has himself no doubt that the press has to-day become “the most\r\nimportant expression of the ‘Evil One.’”[185]\r\n\r\n   “Who could,” he says, “deny to the State the right to control,\r\n   with all the authority that has been confided to it, the\r\n   development and the influence of a power that can undermine\r\n   the authority alike of the family, of the government, and of\r\n   the Church? But if such authority is necessary to maintain the\r\n   foundations of the State, who shall deny an equal right and duty\r\n   to those who are responsible for maintaining the foundations of\r\n   the Church?”[186]\r\n\r\nIn presenting the lists of the German books condemned, Sleumer points\r\nout that it is of course an impossibility for the Congregation of the\r\nIndex to compile with any measure of completeness the titles of all\r\nthe books deserving condemnation. He contends however, that the books\r\nselected may be accepted as fairly typical of the classes calling for\r\ncondemnation and that the Index schedules can, therefore, be utilised\r\nby the more intelligent of the faithful for their own guidance and by\r\nthe confessors who have the responsibility of directing the reading of\r\ntheir flocks.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tyrrell on the Index]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to compare with the implicit acceptance given to the\r\ncensorship policy of the modern Church by the scholarly Jesuit Father\r\nHilgers and by the good Dr. Sleumer, the more discriminating and more\r\ncritical analysis of this policy by a scholarly Jesuit in England,\r\nFather George Tyrrell, whose monograph entitled _A Much Abused\r\nLetter_, comes into print while this volume is passing through\r\nthe press. Father Tyrrell had, it seems, been applied to for counsel\r\nby a devoted friend in the Church (since identified as St. George\r\nMivart) who, in middle life, in connection with certain scientific\r\npursuits and investigations, had found himself in perplexity as to the\r\nfoundations of his faith. The friend had not been able to bring into\r\naccord the conclusions which he had arrived at through his scientific\r\ninvestigations with the latest utterances of the Church authorities\r\nhaving to do with the matters at issue. Seriously troubled at the\r\nthought of being forced out of relations with the Church in whose\r\ncommunion he had grown up, he had asked Father Tyrrell for advice as\r\nto his present duty. The Father had in his reply (which in compass\r\nand character constitutes an essay on the relations of faith with\r\nintellectual pursuits) taken the ground that there was nothing in\r\nthe scientific conclusions that his friend had accepted which made it\r\nnecessary for him to abandon the communion of the Church. It was the\r\nFather’s judgment that the spiritual relations of the believer were to\r\nbe considered quite apart from his scientific opinions or intellectual\r\ndevelopment. The letter, which was intended to be purely personal\r\nand which had for its purpose the saving to the Church of a valued\r\nmember, through some inadvertency came into publication, and, as a\r\nresult, Father Tyrrell was dismissed from the Order of the Jesuits. The\r\nunauthorised publication of the letter had presented an incorrect, not\r\nto say a garbled, text, and the Father now felt at liberty to print the\r\ncorrected text with some commentary on his own relations to the matters\r\nat issue. The document is of decided interest as an expression of the\r\nspiritual and intellectual status of a scholarly Catholic of to-day.\r\nThe selection of opinions of Catholics on the present policy of the\r\nChurch runs the risk of being unduly extended, but I think it in order\r\nto make one or two citations from the volume of this earnest English\r\nJesuit.\r\n\r\n   “The express purpose of the Confidential Letter was to\r\n   dissuade my friend from a breach with the Church which would\r\n   mean an assertion of individualism and a denial of authority\r\n   and corporate life.... My whole line of argument was to\r\n   insist that the reasonable and moderate claims of the Church\r\n   over the individual were not invalidated by any extravagant\r\n   interpretation of those claims.... The heroes of moral romance\r\n   sail serenely through life’s darkest storms, cheered by the\r\n   certainty of their rectitude and by the hearty applause of a\r\n   thoroughly satisfied conscience. But in real life, it seems\r\n   to me that such serenity, and the undoubted force and energy\r\n   which it secures, are the privilege not so much of the heroic\r\n   but of the unreflective.[187]... Only when we take the word\r\n   ‘faith’ in its ethical and evangelical sense, is it true to\r\n   say that loss of faith necessarily implies some moral weakness\r\n   or imperfection. But the saying is palpably false when faith\r\n   is made to stand for theological orthodoxy, for assent to a\r\n   dogmatic system. It is admitted on all hands that such faith\r\n   as this may, and often does, go with the most extreme moral\r\n   depravity--with sensuality and cruelty, with injustice, with\r\n   untruthfulness and hypocrisy, prejudice and superstition.\r\n   Temporal and selfish interests of one sort or another, or\r\n   more commonly still, an absolute lack of all sympathetic and\r\n   intelligent interest in their religion, will keep the great\r\n   majority of such men in the paths of orthodoxy as long as\r\n   orthodoxy is in public fashion and favour.[188]... For one\r\n   reason or another theologians have, for generations, been\r\n   letting their accounts get into disorder; they have trusted to\r\n   the one general principle of ‘authority’ for the quieting of\r\n   all possible doubts and have paid less and less attention to\r\n   particulars. They have forgotten that, by a necessary law of the\r\n   mind, the claims of authority will _de facto_ inevitably\r\n   be called in question as soon as the reasons on which those\r\n   claims rest are cancelled or outweighed by those which stand\r\n   against the particular teachings of authority; that though a\r\n   Catholic as such cannot consistently call this or that Catholic\r\n   doctrine in question, he can consistently call his Catholicism\r\n   in question.[189] However unwilling a man may be to raise doubts\r\n   in his own mind, he cannot live in an age and country like yours\r\n   [England] without these being thrust upon his attention. In\r\n   Mediaeval Spain, where index and inquisition were practically\r\n   workable methods of protection, it was otherwise. There and then\r\n   one needed only not to think in order to be at peace; here and\r\n   now one needs also not to see or hear or read or converse or\r\n   live.\r\n\r\n   There is now no educational grade so low as to be exempt\r\n   entirely from the spirit of criticism, whose influence is of\r\n   course still more strongly felt as we ascend to the higher\r\n   grades.[190]... Turning to the clergy, we find a great readiness\r\n   on the part of individuals to disclaim the honour [of having\r\n   authoritative knowledge] and also a curious vagueness as to the\r\n   precise depositaries for the final authorities [on intellectual\r\n   difficulties]. Taken individually, they frankly say that they\r\n   are themselves incompetent to deal with such problems, but\r\n   they imply that they have an unbounded confidence in their own\r\n   collectivity, or in certain persons (unknown and unknowable)\r\n   whose specialty it is to adjust the claims of sacred and secular\r\n   knowledge. Thus the responsibility, divided over the whole\r\n   multitude of the Church’s children, is shifted from shoulder\r\n   to shoulder, and comes to rest nowhere in particular;[191]...\r\n   The conservative positions (in the Church) are maintained by\r\n   ignorance, systematic or involuntary.... The close historic\r\n   study of Christian origin and development must undermine many\r\n   of our most fundamental assumptions in regard to dogmas and\r\n   institutions.... The sphere of the miraculous is daily limited\r\n   by the growing difficulty in verifying such facts, and the\r\n   growing facility of reducing either them or the belief in them\r\n   to natural and recognised causes.[192]... If the intellectual\r\n   defence of Catholicism breaks down (as far as the individual is\r\n   concerned) does it straightway follow that he should separate\r\n   himself from the communion of the Church? Yes, if theological\r\n   ‘intellectualism’ be right; if faith mean mental assent to a\r\n   system of conceptions of the understanding; if Catholicism\r\n   be primarily a theology or at most a system of practical\r\n   observances regulated by that theology. No, if Catholicism be\r\n   primarily a life, and the Church a spiritual organism in whose\r\n   life we participate, and if theology be but an attempt of that\r\n   life to formulate and understand itself--an attempt which may\r\n   fail wholly or in part without affecting the value and reality\r\n   of life itself.[193]... Must we not distinguish between the\r\n   collective subconsciousness of the ‘People of God’ and the\r\n   consciously formulated mind and will of the governing section of\r\n   the Church? May not our faith in the latter be at times weak or\r\n   nil, and yet our faith in the former strong and invincible?...\r\n   Let us recognise that, in spite of its noisy advertisements,\r\n   this self-conscious, self-formulating Catholicism of the\r\n   thinking, talking, and governing minority is not the whole\r\n   Church, but only an element (however important) in its\r\n   constitution.[194]... Faith is the very root and all-permeating\r\n   inspiration of life. Not the faith of mere obedience to\r\n   authoritative teaching, which is at best a condition of\r\n   spiritual education ... not the faith of merely intellectual\r\n   assent to the historical and metaphysical assertions of a\r\n   theology that claims to be miraculously guaranteed from\r\n   errancy. After all, your quarrel is not with the Church, but\r\n   with the theologians [we are to bear in mind that Tyrrell is\r\n   still addressing his friend whose scholarship has brought him\r\n   into doubt]; not with ecclesiastical authority, but with a\r\n   certain theory as to the nature and limits and grades of that\r\n   authority, and of the value, interpretation, and obligation of\r\n   its decisions.[195]... Who formulate these decisions, determine\r\n   their value, interpret them to us; who have fabricated the whole\r\n   present theology of authority and imposed it upon us, but the\r\n   theologians? Who but the theologians themselves have taught\r\n   us that the concensus of theologians cannot err? These are,\r\n   however, mortal, fallible, ignorant men like ourselves.”[196]\r\n\r\nMay not Catholicism, like Judaism, have to die in order that it may\r\nlive again in a greater and grander form? Has not every organism its\r\nlimits of development after which it must decay, and be content to\r\nsurvive in its progeny? Wine-skins stretch, but only within measure;\r\nfor there comes at last a bursting-point when new ones must be provided.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Briggs on Censorship]\r\n\r\nAnother volume expressing the views of scholarly Catholic believers\r\nin regard to the present intellectual policy of the Church comes into\r\nprint in 1906 while these pages are going through the press. It bears\r\nthe title of _The Papal Commission and the Pentateuch_ and is\r\nthe work of two authors, the Reverend Charles A. Briggs, Professor of\r\nTheology and Symbolics, of the Union Theological Seminary of New York,\r\nand Baron Friedrich von Hügel, at present of Cambridge, England. The\r\nwork and career of Dr. Briggs are, of course, familiar to all who have\r\nknowledge of the issues of later years between the creeds and dogmas\r\nof the Churches and of the difficulties of the great scholars of the\r\npresent generation who have been investigating the texts and records\r\nupon which these creeds and dogmas have been based. Of these scholars,\r\nDr. Briggs is known as one of the most authoritative and conscientious\r\nand also as one possessing the greatest reverence for the purposes and\r\nthe spiritual power of revealed religion. Dr. Briggs, now a member of\r\nthe Episcopal Church, has from time to time brought into expression\r\ncertain ideals in regard to the development of the Church Universal.\r\nIf one understands him aright, he looks forward to the reconstruction,\r\nunder the new conditions of the twentieth century, of a world’s\r\nChurch or Church Universal, which was so nearly realised under the\r\nvery different conditions of the fifteenth century. He is, therefore,\r\nsympathetically interested in the policy of the Church of Rome and he\r\nis in close personal relations with not a few of the scholarly leaders\r\nof that Church. He has united with his friend Baron von Hügel in the\r\nproduction of a monograph made up of two letters, one from himself and\r\none from Baron von Hügel, which have for their purpose the analysis\r\nand criticism of the conclusions arrived at by the recent Papal\r\nCommission in regard to the origin and the history of the Pentateuch.\r\nThe report of the Commission (of the text of which I have no direct\r\nknowledge) appears to have taken strong ground against the results\r\nof the so-called higher scholarship, that is to say, of the latest\r\ninvestigations concerning the origin and the formation of the writings\r\ngoing to make up the Pentateuch. Dr. Briggs cites from the record of\r\nthe Papal Commission the statement that\r\n\r\n   “certain faulty readings in the text of the Pentateuch may be\r\n   ascribed to the error of an amanuensis concerning which it\r\n   is lawful to investigate and judge according to the laws of\r\n   criticism.... But in so doing ‘Due regard must be paid to the\r\n   judgment of the Church.’ It is admitted [says Briggs], (by\r\n   the Papal Commission) that investigation and judgment must be\r\n   ‘according to the laws of criticism.’ If this is so, then it\r\n   necessarily follows that the laws of criticism must determine\r\n   the entire investigation, and not merely any definite part of\r\n   it.”[197]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Von Hügel on Censorship]\r\n\r\nThe Baron’s division of the monograph applies, of course, more directly\r\nto the subject of the present chapter as an expression of the views of\r\na scholarly Catholic on the present intellectual policy of the Church.\r\nHe writes as follows:\r\n\r\n   ‘For you cannot teach whom you do not understand, and\r\n   you cannot win the man with whom you cannot share certain\r\n   presuppositions.... The cultivated non-Roman Catholic world\r\n   is, in part unconsciously, often slowly yet everywhere surely,\r\n   getting permeated and won by critical standards and methods.\r\n   A system cannot claim to teach all the world and at the same\r\n   time erect an impenetrable partition-wall between itself and\r\n   the educated portion of that world.[198]... This opinion of\r\n   the Biblical Commission is surely but one link in a chain of\r\n   official attempts at the suppression of Science and Scholarship,\r\n   beginning with Erasmus and culminating with Richard Simon and\r\n   Alfred Loisy, but never entirely absent, as witness the lives\r\n   of countless workers, well-known to their fellow-workers....\r\n   When and where has Rome finally abandoned any position however\r\n   informal and late its occupation, and however demonstrated\r\n   its untenableness? Where, in particular, is the case of its\r\n   permission to hold critical and historical views even distantly\r\n   comparable in their deviation from tradition to those here\r\n   presented by us? But if no such cases can be found, then,\r\n   surely, Rome stands utterly discredited....”[199]\r\n\r\nThe Baron recalls that, on January 13th, 1897, there appeared,\r\n\r\n   “approved and confirmed by Pope Leo XIII, a Decree of the Holy\r\n   Office, in the highest Roman tribunal next after the Pope\r\n   himself, and which, unlike the Biblical Commission, claims\r\n   directly doctrinal authority, giving a negative answer to the\r\n   question, ‘Whether it is safe to deny, or at least to call in\r\n   doubt, the authenticity of the text of St. John, in the First\r\n   Epistle, chapter v, verse 7, “For there are three that give\r\n   testimony in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit,\r\n   and these three are one.”’”[200]\r\n\r\nThe Baron closes his letter (which is addressed to his friend Dr.\r\nBriggs) with the words:\r\n\r\n   “That we can and ought, both of us, to pray, to will, and to\r\n   work that the advisers of the chief Bishop of Christendom,\r\n   in the manifold mixed subject-matters which they have to\r\n   prepare and to bring before him, may have a vivid realisation\r\n   of the difficulty and complexity, the importance and rights\r\n   and duties of those other departments of life--Science and\r\n   Scholarship--lest these forces, ignored or misunderstood, bring\r\n   inevitable obstruction and eclipse to those direct and central\r\n   interests and ideals which are the fundamental motives of all\r\n   spiritual life, and the true mainspring and impregnable citadel\r\n   of the Christian, Catholic, and Roman Church.”[201]\r\n\r\nI can but feel that these utterances of sane and reverent Catholic\r\nbelievers of to-day are expressions of a state of mind with which the\r\nChurch of Rome will have to reckon in the near future unless the realm\r\nof its believers is to be restricted to those who are the less sane and\r\nless scholarly and, to those who, to put it frankly, have a smaller\r\nmeasure of intellectual integrity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conclusions]\r\n\r\nIt may be concluded that the general regulations of the Index and the\r\ninsistence on the part of the Church of the right and the obligation\r\nof supervising the output of the printing-press and of controlling\r\nand directing the reading of the faithful, did exert a restrictive\r\ninfluence on the production and distribution of literature. This\r\ninfluence was, however, limited to the territories in which the\r\nmachinery of the Inquisition was in active existence. In the regions\r\nnorth of the Alps and the Pyrenees, the Index regulations brought\r\nabout but a spasmodic and inconsiderable interference with the\r\ndistribution of the works of Protestant writers. Outside of the lands\r\nof the Inquisition, the Church had no other means of hindering the\r\nreading of heretical books than to declare the same to be deadly sin\r\nand to threaten the delinquents with such penalties as excommunication.\r\nThe records of applications for dispensations present, as Reusch points\r\nout,[202] evidence that scholarly Catholics made frequent opportunity\r\nfor infringing the censorship prohibitions. It would in fact be\r\ndifficult to specify any territory in which the Index regulations\r\nwere accepted cheerfully and thoroughly. It is certain that, even\r\nin the most faithful of the Catholic communities, bitter complaints\r\narose from time to time on the part of the scholars in regard to the\r\ndestruction of valuable literature and the resulting interference\r\nwith scholarly work. There were also complaints of a different kind.\r\nThose who were interested in preserving the true faith from being\r\nundermined by heretical doctrine, came to the realisation of the fact\r\nthat heretical books were, through the operations of the Index, brought\r\nto the attention of many who otherwise would never have known of their\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nIn 1549, Gabriel Putherbeus, writing to Theotimus, complains that\r\nthe books prohibited by the Paris divines were being read by people\r\nto whom they would never have become known excepting through the\r\ncensorship lists.[203] Gratianus Verus writes that the Index of Paul\r\nIV had had a most pernicious influence in making known to Catholic\r\nreaders a long list of Protestant writings. Protestant scholars\r\nutilised the catalogues in the Index very largely as recommendations\r\nof books that were deserving of consideration. The more thoughtful\r\nCatholics were ready to recognise that, as an offset to the importance\r\nof protecting the faithful from the influence of heretical doctrines,\r\nthe publication of the Index-lists brought serious disadvantages. The\r\nreading of the Scriptures was rendered unduly difficult for many to\r\nwhom the instruction therein contained should prove of service. The\r\nstudy of the Bible, of the works of the Fathers of the Church, and of\r\nmuch of the literature of scholarship, was seriously hampered even\r\nfor devout scholars. The pursuit of scientific studies by Catholic\r\nstudents and instructors was placed under great disadvantages through\r\nthe prohibition and cancellation even of such works of reference as\r\nlexicons, when these bore the names of Protestant compilers. The\r\nopportunity of utilising such lexicons when specific permission had\r\nbeen secured from bishops or from inquisitors could not sufficiently\r\nmeet the difficulty. The possibility of securing expurgated editions\r\nof books the original and complete text of which had fallen under\r\ncondemnation, proved in practice to be too slight a dependence. The\r\nprinter-publishers, who had been subjected to loss, and often to very\r\nserious loss, through the cancellation of the original edition, were\r\nas a rule not encouraged to make the further investment required for\r\nthe printing of the “corrected” and expurgated text. It was also the\r\ncase that these expurgations were frequently made very heedlessly, and\r\nwith a full measure of ignorance of the subject-matter of the book,\r\nand of the precise purport of the original text. As a result, if the\r\neliminations ordered by the censors were carried out with precision,\r\nthe text as it remained presented no adequate sense. On the other\r\nhand, the insertion of any changes whatsoever, or of any new material\r\nin the expurgated text, subjected the reissue to a further censorship\r\nand to the risk of a second cancellation.\r\n\r\nIn the States in which, as in Spain and Portugal, the entire control of\r\nthe censorship was left with the Inquisition, the scholars and students\r\nwere practically deprived of the use of foreign literature. Writers\r\nlike Pallavicini congratulate themselves that the dread of the Index\r\n(that is to say, of course, of the penalties of the Index regulations)\r\nhas had the effect of checking very largely the printing and the\r\ndistribution of books, and must, according to his view, have served to\r\ndiscourage the writing of books. It is evidently his point of view that\r\nthe possible advantages from active literary production are more than\r\noffset by the resulting evils.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties for students and readers were of necessity increased\r\nby the lack of any consistency or uniformity of policy on the part\r\nof the Congregation of the Index, of the Inquisitions (whether in\r\nRome or in Spain), or of the _Magister Palatii_. In fact, with\r\nthe inevitable change in the personnel of these authorities, it is\r\ndifficult to see how any absolutely consistent policy could have been\r\nmaintained through a term of years. The men representing different\r\nOrders were, as Jesuits, Dominicans, Franciscans, etc., committed to\r\ndifferences of dogma and of interpretation which seemed to them to be\r\nvital. As the opportunity came into their hands, it was inevitable that\r\nthey should do what was in their power to discourage the production and\r\nto lessen the distribution, not only of the works of avowed heretics,\r\nbut of the books of writers of different schools of thought and of\r\nfaith within the communion of Rome. The contests between the Orders\r\nwere carried into the work of censorship and found their expression in\r\nthe varying lists of the Indexes of successive decades or of different\r\ncentres of Church authority. There may be ground for wonder, not that\r\nthe interference with the literature of these Catholic countries\r\nwas so considerable, but that the Catholic scholars of the 16th and\r\nthe first half of the 17th century were able, under such hampering\r\nrestrictions, to leave any literary monuments of continued value. The\r\nresults of the censorship system can of course also not be measured by\r\nwhat may be termed the direct action, the value of the scholarly books\r\ndestroyed, the interference with the work of scholarly readers, the\r\nproperty losses caused to the printer-publishers and the booksellers,\r\nand, through them, to the community. We must bear in mind also the\r\nrestrictive influence on literary production and on intellectual\r\ndevelopment. Many works that might have stimulated and enlightened the\r\nworld were undoubtedly, after some sharp activities of the censors,\r\ndestroyed in manuscript rather than, in being brought into print,\r\nto bring risk to their authors of loss of position, of banishment,\r\nor of excommunication. In other cases, writers of individuality and\r\ndistinctive force decided to cancel their proposed books in the\r\ninitial stage of lecture notes, rather than, in bringing the material\r\nto completion and into print, to risk loss of position, banishment,\r\nor excommunication. In the States that accepted the authority of the\r\nIndex, and particularly in the territories in which this authority\r\nwas exercised by the Inquisition, the existence of the Index and the\r\nmachinery of the censorship acted as a blight on literary production\r\nand distribution and constituted a serious bar to the interests of\r\nhigher education and to intellectual development. Such a restriction\r\non the natural operations of the mind, enforced through a long series\r\nof years, must have had a repressing effect also on character and\r\nindividuality, besides tending to the development of deceit and the\r\nimpairment of manliness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dejob on the Papacy.]\r\n\r\n   “In concluding my summary of the influence of the Church\r\n   on the literature of Europe, I find myself,” says Dejob,\r\n   “considering one hypothesis. What might the result have been\r\n   for the Church and for Europe, if the college of Cardinals,\r\n   in place of considering the nationality only of candidates\r\n   for the tiara, had made its selections purely on the basis of\r\n   merit and capacity? What might have happened if, for instance,\r\n   the papal throne had been filled by a series of Popes from\r\n   France?... Imperial Rome had the wisdom to select its successive\r\n   rulers from the diverse provinces that came within its rule,\r\n   and in so doing, it unquestionably widened and strengthened\r\n   the foundations of the Empire. Christian Rome might assuredly\r\n   have secured similar results from a similar world-wide policy.\r\n   A Bossuet or a Massillon selected for the pontificate would\r\n   certainly have governed the Church with a spirit at once more\r\n   serious and more comprehensive, and would have rendered enormous\r\n   service to the interests of Catholicism and of Europe. The\r\n   spirit of Popes of such calibre would have kept within bounds\r\n   the continued disputes on smaller matters of doctrine which\r\n   have wasted the force and narrowed the intelligence of so many\r\n   excellent Christians. They would not have been able to prevent\r\n   the diffusion of philosophical ideas, but I feel confident that\r\n   faith, as represented and defended by them, would have been\r\n   assailed with less bitterness and with less effectiveness....\r\n   The Church, like France itself, should have been able to remain\r\n   serious without becoming Puritan; and to develop intellectual\r\n   brilliancy without any compromise of the foundations of faith or\r\n   of morality.\r\n\r\n   “I may admit that we have here only an hypothesis but it is fair\r\n   to remember, in thinking how the influence of France might have\r\n   served the highest ideals of the Church, how large an evidence\r\n   during the past two centuries the French spirit has given of\r\n   earnestness, of moral discipline, of wholesome force. It has\r\n   preserved with a hatred of hypocrisy, an aversion for servility,\r\n   a large liberality of thought, and it is such a combination of\r\n   qualities that should have been made of the largest service to\r\n   the Church and to the world.”[204]\r\n\r\nAs has been indicated in the preceding narrative, there has been\r\nthrough the centuries not a little varying in the policy of Roman\r\ncensorship and in the enforcement of its regulations according as\r\none or another Order or school of thought secured the control of the\r\nPapacy, or of the machinery of the Inquisition and of the Congregation\r\nof the Index. This control, however, has remained, not only for the\r\nPapacy, but also in great measure for the Roman Inquisition and for\r\nthe Congregation of the Index, in the hands of Italians. The result\r\nhas been, of necessity, from generation to generation, to force into a\r\nconformity with local Italian standards the literary activities, and\r\nthe intellectual development, of the faithful throughout the world.\r\nThere is certainly ground for the conclusion that under this policy,\r\nthe Index (including under this term the whole system of censorship)\r\ncame to constitute one of the more important of the influences which\r\nhave worked through the centuries towards the narrowing of the\r\nChurch Universal (the magnificent ideal of the Middle Ages) into the\r\norganisation known in our twentieth century as the Church of Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SCHEDULE OF INDEXES\r\n\r\n   SCHEDULE OF INDEXES WHICH WERE ISSUED UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE\r\n   CHURCH, OR WHICH, HAVING BEEN COMPILED BY ECCLESIASTICS, WERE\r\n   PUBLISHED UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE STATE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    1526, London, Henry VIII, the Archbishop of Canterbury.\r\n    1543, Paris, the Sorbonne.\r\n    1544, Paris, the Sorbonne.\r\n    1545, Lucca, the Inquisition.\r\n    1546, Louvain, Theol.

The book was as a joke ascribed to Jacques Davy, Bishop of\r\nEvreaux. Davy was better known under the name of Du Perron. He was\r\na convert from Protestantism and was the Bishop selected to bring\r\nKing Henry IV into the Catholic fold. The _Evangelium Romanum_\r\nwas reprinted more than once and appears to have secured a wide\r\ncirculation. Curiously enough, it did not find place upon the Index\r\n(Reusch, ii, 213).\r\n\r\n[152] See an edict of the Inquisition dated 1611, cited by Dejob p. 216.\r\n\r\n[153] Ottonelli, _Memoriali_, etc., cited by Dejob, 218.\r\n\r\n[154] Ticknor, vol. ii, Appendix.\r\n\r\n[155] Migne, _Nouvelle Encyclop.
