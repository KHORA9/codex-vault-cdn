It will try simply to tell of a generation of\r\nmen who, even though they may have escaped its shells, were destroyed\r\nby the war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nWe are at rest five miles behind the front.  Yesterday we were\r\nrelieved, and now our bellies are full of beef and haricot beans.  We\r\nare satisfied and at peace.  Each man has another mess-tin full for\r\nthe evening; and, what is more, there is a double ration of sausage\r\nand bread.  That puts a man in fine trim.  We have not had such luck\r\nas this for a long time.  The cook with his carroty head is begging\r\nus to eat; he beckons with his ladle to every one that passes, and\r\nspoons him out a great dollop.  He does not see how he can empty his\r\nstew-pot in time for coffee.  Tjaden and Müller have produced two\r\nwash-basins and had them filled up to the brim as a reserve.  In\r\nTjaden this is voracity, in Müller it is foresight.  Where Tjaden\r\nputs it all is a mystery, for he is and always will be as thin as a\r\nrake.\r\n\r\nWhat's more important still is the issue of a double ration of\r\nsmokes.  Ten cigars, twenty cigarettes, and two quids of chew per\r\nman; now that is decent.  I have exchanged my chewing tobacco with\r\nKatczinsky for his cigarettes, which means I have forty altogether.\r\nThat's enough for a day.\r\n\r\nIt is true we have no right to this windfall.  The Prussian is not so\r\ngenerous.  We have only a miscalculation to thank for it.\r\n\r\nFourteen days ago we had to go up and relieve the front line.  It was\r\nfairly quiet on our sector, so the quartermaster who remained in the\r\nrear had requisitioned the usual quantity of rations and provided for\r\nthe full company of one hundred and fifty men.  But on the last day\r\nan astonishing number of English field-guns opened up on us with\r\nhigh-explosive, drumming ceaselessly on our position, so that we\r\nsuffered heavily and came back only eighty strong.\r\n\r\nLast night we moved back and settled down to get a good sleep for\r\nonce: Katczinsky is right when he says it would not be such a bad war\r\nif only one could get a little more sleep.  In the line we have had\r\nnext to none, and fourteen days is a long time at one stretch.\r\n\r\nIt was noon before the first of us crawled out of our quarters.  Half\r\nan hour later every man had his mess-tin and we gathered at the\r\ncook-house, which smelt greasy and nourishing.  At the head of the\r\nqueue of course were the hungriest--little Albert Kropp, the clearest\r\nthinker among us and therefore the first to be lance-corporal;\r\nMüller, who still carries his school textbooks with him, dreams of\r\nexaminations, and during a bombardment mutters propositions in\r\nphysics; Leer, who wears a full beard and has a preference for the\r\ngirls from officers' brothels.  He swears that they are obliged by an\r\narmy order to wear silk chemises and to bathe before entertaining\r\nguests of the rank of major and upwards.  And as the fourth, myself,\r\nPaul Bäumer.  All four are nineteen years of age, and all four joined\r\nup from the same class as volunteers for the war.\r\n\r\nClose behind us were our friends: Tjaden, a skinny lock-smith of our\r\nown age, the biggest eater of the company.  He sits down to eat as\r\nthin as a grasshopper and gets up as big as a bug in the family way;\r\nHaie Westhus, of the same age, a peat-digger, who can easily hold a\r\nration-loaf in his hand and say: Guess what I've got in my fist; then\r\nDetering, a peasant, who thinks of nothing but his farm-yard and his\r\nwife; and finally Stanislaus Katczinsky, the leader of our group,\r\nshrewd, cunning, and hard-bitten, forty years of age, with a face of\r\nthe soil, blue eyes, bent shoulders, and a remarkable nose for dirty\r\nweather, good food, and soft jobs.\r\n\r\nOur gang formed the head of the queue before the cook-house.  We were\r\ngrowing impatient, for the cook paid no attention to us.\r\n\r\nFinally Katczinsky called out to him: \"Say, Heinrich, open up the\r\nsoup-kitchen.  Anyone can see the beans are done.\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head sleepily: \"You must all be there first.\"  Tjaden\r\ngrinned: \"We are all here.\"\r\n\r\nThe sergeant-cook still took no notice.  \"That may do for you,\" he\r\nsaid.  \"But where are the others?\"\r\n\r\n\"They won't be fed by you to-day.  They're either in the\r\ndressing-station or pushing up daisies.\"\r\n\r\nThe cook was quite disconcerted as the facts dawned on him.  He was\r\nstaggered.  \"And I have cooked for one hundred and fifty men----\"\r\n\r\nKropp poked him in the ribs.  \"Then for once we'll have enough.  Come\r\non, begin!\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly a vision came over Tjaden.  His sharp, mousey features began\r\nto shine, his eyes grew small with cunning, his jaws twitched, and he\r\nwhispered hoarsely: \"Man! then you've got bread for one hundred and\r\nfifty men too, eh?\"\r\n\r\nThe sergeant-cook nodded absent-minded, and bewildered.\r\n\r\nTjaden seized him by the tunic.  \"And sausage?\"\r\n\r\nGinger nodded again.\r\n\r\nTjaden's chaps quivered.  \"Tobacco too?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, everything.\"\r\n\r\nTjaden beamed: \"What a bean-feast!  That's all for us!  Each man\r\ngets--wait a bit--yes, practically two issues.\"\r\n\r\nThen Ginger stirred himself and said: \"That won't do.\"\r\n\r\nThen we got excited and began to crowd around.\r\n\r\n\"Why won't that do, you old carrot?\" demanded Katczinsky.\r\n\r\n\"Eighty men can't have what is meant for a hundred and fifty.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll soon show you,\" growled Müller.\r\n\r\n\"I don't care about the stew, but I can only issue rations for eighty\r\nmen,\" persisted Ginger.\r\n\r\nKatczinsky got angry.  \"You might be generous for once.  You haven't\r\ndrawn food for eighty men.  You've drawn it for the Second Company.\r\nGood.  Let's have it then.  We are the Second Company.\"\r\n\r\nWe began to jostle the fellow.  No one felt kindly toward him, for it\r\nwas his fault that the food twice came up to us in the line too late\r\nand cold.  Under shell-fire he wouldn't bring his kitchen up near\r\nenough, so that our soup-carriers had to go much farther than those\r\nof the other companies.  Now Bulcke of the First Company is a much\r\nbetter fellow.  He is as fat as a hamster in winter, but he trundles\r\nhis pots when it comes to that right up to the very front line.\r\n\r\nWe were in just the right mood, and there would certainly have been a\r\ndust-up if our company commander had not appeared.  He informed\r\nhimself of the dispute, and only remarked: \"Yes, we did have heavy\r\nlosses yesterday.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked in the dixie.  \"The beans look good.\"\r\n\r\nGinger nodded.  \"Cooked with meat and fat.\"\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant looked at us.  He knew what we were thinking.  And he\r\nknew many other things too, because he came to the company as a\r\nnon-com. and was promoted from the ranks.  He lifted the lid from the\r\ndixie again and sniffed.  Then passing on he said: \"Serve out the\r\nwhole issue.  We can do with it.  And bring me a plate full too.\"\r\n\r\nGinger looked sheepish as Tjaden danced round him.\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't cost you anything!  One would think the quartermaster's\r\nstore belonged to him!  And now get on with it, you old\r\nblubber-sticker, and don't you miscount either.\"\r\n\r\n\"You be hanged!\" spat out Ginger.  When things get beyond him he\r\nthrows up the sponge altogether; he just goes to pieces.  And as if\r\nto show that all things were now the same to him, of his own free\r\nwill he shared out half a pound of synthetic honey equally among us.\r\n\r\nTo-day is wonderfully good.  The mail has come, and almost every man\r\nhas a couple of letters and papers.  We stroll over to the meadow\r\nbehind the billets.  Kropp has the round lid of a margarine tub under\r\nhis arm.\r\n\r\nOn the right side of the meadow a large common latrine has been\r\nbuilt, a well-planned and durable construction.  But that is for\r\nrecruits who as yet have not learned how to make the most of whatever\r\ncomes their way.  We look for something better.  Scattered about\r\neverywhere there are separate, individual boxes for the same purpose.\r\nThey are square, neat boxes with wooden sides all round, and have\r\nunimpeachably satisfactory seats.  On the sides are hand-grips\r\nenabling one to shift them about.  We move three together in a ring\r\nand sit down comfortably.  For two hours we have been here without\r\ngetting up.\r\n\r\nI well remember how embarrassed we were as recruits in barracks when\r\nwe had to use the general latrine.  There were no doors and twenty\r\nmen sat side by side as in a railway carriage, so that they could be\r\nreviewed all at one glance, for soldiers must always be under\r\nsupervision.\r\n\r\nSince then we have learned better than to be shy about such trifling\r\nimmodesties.  In time things far worse than that came easy to us.\r\n\r\nHere in the open air though, the business is entirely a pleasure.  I\r\nno longer understand why we should always have shied at it before.\r\nIt is, in fact, just as natural as eating and drinking.  We did not\r\nproperly appreciate these boxes when we first enlisted; they were new\r\nto us and did not fill such an important rôle--but now they have long\r\nbeen a matter of course.\r\n\r\nThe soldier is on friendlier terms than other men with his stomach\r\nand intestines.  Three-quarters of his vocabulary is derived from\r\nthese regions, and they give an intimate flavour to expressions of\r\nhis greatest joy as well as of his deepest indignation.  It is\r\nimpossible to express oneself in any other way so clearly and\r\npithily.  Our families and our teachers will be shocked when we go\r\nhome, but here it is the universal language.\r\n\r\nEnforced publicity has in our eyes restored the character of complete\r\ninnocence to all these things.  More than that, they are so much a\r\nmatter of course that their comfortable performance is fully as much\r\nenjoyed as the playing of a safe top running flush.  Not for nothing\r\nwas the word \"latrine-rumour\" invented; these places are the\r\nregimental gossip-shops and common-rooms.\r\n\r\nWe feel ourselves for the time being better off than in any palatial\r\nwhite-tiled \"convenience.\"  _There_ it can only be hygienic; _here_\r\nit is beautiful.\r\n\r\nThese are wonderfully care-free hours.  Over us is the blue sky.  On\r\nthe horizon float the bright yellow, sunlit observation-balloons, and\r\nthe many little white clouds of the anti-aircraft shells.  Often they\r\nrise in a sheaf as they follow after an airman.  We hear the muffled\r\nrumble of the front only as very distant thunder, bumble-bees droning\r\nby quite drown it.  Around us stretches the flowery meadow.  The\r\ngrasses sway their tall spears; the white butterflies flutter around\r\nand float on the soft warm wind of the late summer.  We read letters\r\nand newspapers and smoke.  We take off our caps and lay them down\r\nbeside us.  The wind plays with our hair; it plays with our words and\r\nthoughts.  The three boxes stand in the midst of the glowing, red\r\nfield-poppies.\r\n\r\nWe set the lid of the margarine tub on our knees and so have a good\r\ntable for a game of skat.  Kropp has the cards with him.  After every\r\nthrow-in the loser pays into the pool.  One could sit like this for\r\never.\r\n\r\nThe notes of an accordion float across from the billets.  Often we\r\nlay aside the cards and look about us.  One of us will say: \"Well,\r\nboys....\"  Or \"It was a near thing that time....\"  And for a moment\r\nwe fall silent.  There is in each of us a feeling of constraint.  We\r\nare all sensible of it; it needs no words to communicate it.  It\r\nmight easily have happened that we should not be sitting here on our\r\nboxes to-day; it came damn near to that.  And so everything is new\r\nand brave, red poppies and good food, cigarettes and summer breeze.\r\n\r\nKropp asks: \"Anyone seen Kemmerich lately?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's up at St. Joseph's,\" I tell him.\r\n\r\nMüller explains that he has a flesh wound in his thigh; a good\r\nblighty.\r\n\r\nWe decide to go and see him this afternoon.\r\n\r\nKropp pulls out a letter.  \"Kantorek sends you all his best wishes.\"\r\n\r\nWe laugh.  Müller throws his cigarette away and says: \"I wish he was\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nKantorek had been our schoolmaster, an active little man in a grey\r\ntail-coat, with a face like a shrew-mouse.  He was about the same\r\nsize as Corporal Himmelstoss, the \"Terror of Klosterberg.\"  It is\r\nvery queer that the unhappiness of the world is so often brought on\r\nby small men.  They are so much more energetic and uncompromising\r\nthan the big fellows.  I have always taken good care to keep out of\r\nsections with small company commanders.  They are mostly confounded\r\nlittle martinets.\r\n\r\nDuring drill-time Kantorek gave us long lectures until the whole of\r\nour class went under his shepherding to the District Commandant and\r\nvolunteered.  I can see him now, as he used to glare at us through\r\nhis spectacles and say in a moving voice: \"Won't you join up,\r\nComrades.\"\r\n\r\nThese teachers always carry their feelings ready in their waistcoat\r\npockets, and fetch them out at any hour of the day.  But we didn't\r\nthink of that then.\r\n\r\nThere was, indeed, one of us who hesitated and did not want to fall\r\ninto line.  That was Josef Behm, a plump, homely fellow.  But he did\r\nallow himself to be persuaded, otherwise he would have been\r\nostracized.  And perhaps more of us thought as he did, but no one\r\ncould very well stand out, because at that time even one's parents\r\nwere ready with the word \"coward\"; no one had the vaguest idea what\r\nwe were in for.  The wisest were just the poor and simple people.\r\nThey knew the war to be a misfortune, whereas people who were better\r\noff were beside themselves with joy, though they should have been\r\nmuch better able to judge what the consequences would be.\r\n\r\nKatczinsky said that was a result of their upbringing.  It made them\r\nstupid.  And what Kat said, he had thought about.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, Behm was one of the first to fall.  He got hit in the\r\neye during an attack, and we left him lying for dead.  We couldn't\r\nbring him with us, because we had to come back helter-skelter.  In\r\nthe afternoon suddenly we heard him call, and saw him outside\r\ncreeping towards us.  He had only been knocked unconscious.  Because\r\nhe could not see, and was mad with pain, he failed to keep under\r\ncover, and so was shot down before anyone could go and fetch him in.\r\n\r\nNaturally we couldn't blame Kantorek for this.  Where would the world\r\nbe if one brought every man to book?  There were thousands of\r\nKantoreks, all of whom were convinced that there was only one way of\r\ndoing well, and that way theirs.\r\n\r\nAnd that is just why they let us down so badly.\r\n\r\nFor us lads of eighteen they ought to have been mediators and guides\r\nto the world of maturity, the world of work, of duty, of culture, of\r\nprogress--to the future.  We often made fun of them and played jokes\r\non them, but in our hearts we trusted them.  The idea of authority,\r\nwhich they represented, was associated in our minds with a greater\r\ninsight and a manlier wisdom.  But the first death we saw shattered\r\nthis belief.  We had to recognize that our generation was more to be\r\ntrusted than theirs.  They surpassed us only in phrases and in\r\ncleverness.  The first bombardment showed us our mistake, and under\r\nit the world as they had taught it to us broke in pieces.\r\n\r\nWhile they continued to write and talk, we saw the wounded and dying.\r\nWhile they taught that duty to one's country is the greatest thing,\r\nwe already knew that death-throes are stronger.  But for all that we\r\nwere no mutineers, no deserters, no cowards--they were very free with\r\nall these expressions.  We loved our country as much as they, we went\r\ncourageously into every action; but also we distinguished the false\r\nfrom the true, we had suddenly learned to see.  And we saw that there\r\nwas nothing of their world left.  We were all at once terribly alone;\r\nand alone we must see it through.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nBefore going over to see Kemmerich we pack up his things: he will\r\nneed them on the way back.\r\n\r\nIn the dressing station there is great activity; it reeks as ever of\r\ncarbolic, ether, and sweat.  Most of us are accustomed to this in the\r\nbillets, but here it makes one feel faint.  We ask for Kemmerich.  He\r\nlies in a large room and receives us with feeble expressions of joy\r\nand helpless agitation.  While he was unconscious someone had stolen\r\nhis watch.\r\n\r\nMüller shakes his head: \"I always told you that nobody should carry\r\nas good a watch as that.\"\r\n\r\nMüller is rather crude and tactless, otherwise he would hold his\r\ntongue, for anybody can see that Kemmerich will never come out of\r\nthis place again.  Whether he finds his watch or not will make no\r\ndifference.  At the most one will only be able to send it to his\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\"How goes it, Franz?\" asks Kropp.\r\n\r\nKemmerich's head sinks.\r\n\r\n\"Not so bad ... but I have such a damned pain in my foot.\"\r\n\r\nWe look at his bed covering.  His leg lies under a wire basket.  The\r\nbed covering arches over it.  I kick Müller on the shin, for he is\r\njust about to tell Kemmerich what the orderlies told us outside: that\r\nKemmerich has lost his foot.  The leg is amputated.  He looks\r\nghastly, yellow, and wan.  In his face there are already the strained\r\nlines that we know so well, we have seen them now hundreds of times.\r\nThey are not so much lines as marks.  Under the skin the life no\r\nlonger pulses, it has already pressed out to the boundaries of the\r\nbody.  Death is working through from within.  It already has command\r\nin the eyes.  Here lies our comrade, Kemmerich, who a little while\r\nago was roasting horse-flesh with us and squatting in the\r\nshell-holes.  He it is still and yet it is not he any longer.  His\r\nfeatures have become uncertain and faint, like a photographic plate\r\non which two pictures have been taken.  Even his voice sounds like\r\nashes.\r\n\r\nI think of the time when we went away.  His mother, a good plump\r\nmatron, brought him to the station.  She wept continually, her face\r\nwas bloated and swollen.  Kemmerich felt embarrassed, for she was the\r\nleast composed of all; she simply dissolved into fat and water.  Then\r\nshe caught sight of me and took hold of my arm again and again, and\r\nimplored me to look after Franz out there.  Indeed he did have a face\r\nlike a child, and such frail bones that after four weeks\r\npack-carrying he already had flat feet.  But how can a man look after\r\nanyone in the field!\r\n\r\n\"Now you will soon be going home,\" says Kropp.  \"You would have had\r\nto wait at least three or four months for your leave.\"\r\n\r\nKemmerich nods.  I cannot bear to look at his hands, they are like\r\nwax.  Under the nails is the dirt of the trenches, it shows through\r\nblue-black like poison.  It strikes me that these nails will continue\r\nto grow like long fantastic cellar-plants long after Kemmerich\r\nbreathes no more.  I see the picture before me.  They twist\r\nthemselves into corkscrews and grow and grow, and with them the hair\r\non the decayed skull, just like grass in a good soil, just like\r\ngrass, how can it be possible----\r\n\r\nMüller leans over.  \"We have brought your things, Franz.\"\r\n\r\nKemmerich signs with his hand.  \"Put them under the bed.\"\r\n\r\nMüller does so.  Kemmerich starts on again about the watch.  How can\r\none calm him without making him suspicious?\r\n\r\nMüller reappears with a pair of airman's boots.  They are fine\r\nEnglish boots of soft, yellow leather which reach to the knee and\r\nlace all the way--they are things to be coveted.\r\n\r\nMüller is delighted at the sight of them.  He matches their soles\r\nagainst his own clumsy boots and says: \"Will you be taking them with\r\nyou then, Franz?\"\r\n\r\nWe all three have the same thought; even if he should get better, he\r\nwould be able to use only one--they are no use to him.  But as things\r\nare now it is a pity that they should stay here; the orderlies will\r\nof course grab them as soon as he is dead.\r\n\r\n\"Won't you leave them with us?\" Müller repeats.\r\n\r\nKemmerich doesn't want to.  They are his most prized possessions.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we could exchange,\" suggests Müller again.  \"Out here one can\r\nmake some use of them.\"  Still Kemmerich is not to be moved.\r\n\r\nI tread on Müller's foot; reluctantly he puts the fine boots back\r\nagain under the bed.\r\n\r\nWe talk a little more and then take our leave.\r\n\r\n\"Cheerio, Franz.\"\r\n\r\nI promise him to come back in the morning.  Müller talks of doing so\r\ntoo.  He is thinking of the lace-up boots and means to be on the spot.\r\n\r\nKemmerich groans.  He is feverish.  We get hold of an orderly outside\r\nand ask him to give Kemmerich a dose of morphia.\r\n\r\nHe refuses.  \"If we were to give morphia to everyone we would have to\r\nhave tubs full----\"\r\n\r\n\"You only attend to officers properly,\" says Kropp viciously.\r\n\r\nI hastily intervene and give him a cigarette.  He takes it.\r\n\r\n\"Are you usually allowed to give it, then?\" I ask him.\r\n\r\nHe is annoyed.  \"If you don't think so, then why do you ask?\"\r\n\r\nI press a couple more cigarettes into his hand.  \"Do us the\r\nfavour----\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, all right,\" he says.\r\n\r\nKropp goes in with him.  He doesn't trust him and wants to see.  We\r\nwait outside.\r\n\r\nMüller returns to the subject of the boots.  \"They would fit me\r\nperfectly.  In these boots I get blister after blister.  Do you think\r\nhe will last till to-morrow after drill?  If he passes out in the\r\nnight, we know where the boots----\"\r\n\r\nKropp returns.  \"Do you think----?\" he asks.\r\n\r\n\"Done for,\" says Müller emphatically.\r\n\r\nWe go back to the huts.  I think of the letter that I must write\r\nto-morrow to Kemmerich's mother.  I am freezing.  I could do with a\r\ntot of rum.  Müller pulls up some grass and chews it.  Suddenly\r\nlittle Kropp throws his cigarette away, stamps on it savagely, and\r\nlooking round him with a broken and distracted face, stammers:\r\n\"Damned shit, the damned shit!\"\r\n\r\nWe walk on for a long time.  Kropp has calmed himself; we understand:\r\nhe sees red, out here every man gets like that sometime.\r\n\r\n\"What has Kantorek written to you?\" Müller asks him.\r\n\r\nHe laughs.  \"We are the Iron Youth.\"\r\n\r\nWe all three smile bitterly.  Kropp rails: he is glad that he can\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\nYes, that's the way they think, these hundred thousand Kantoreks!\r\nIron Youth.  Youth!  We are none of us more than twenty years old.\r\nBut young?  Youth?  That is long ago.  We are old folk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nIt is strange to think that at home in the drawer of my writing table\r\nthere lies the beginning of a play called \"Saul\" and a bundle of\r\npoems.  Many an evening I have worked over them--we all did something\r\nof the kind--but that has become so unreal to me that I cannot\r\ncomprehend it any more.  Our early life is cut off from the moment we\r\ncame here, and that without our lifting a hand.  We often try to look\r\nback on it and to find an explanation, but never quite succeed.  For\r\nus young men of twenty everything is extraordinarily vague, for\r\nKropp, Müller, Leer, and me, for all of us whom Kantorek calls the\r\n\"Iron Youth.\"  All the older men are linked up with their previous\r\nlife.  They have wives, children, occupations, and interests, they\r\nhave a background which is so strong that the war cannot obliterate\r\nit.  We young men of twenty, however, have only our parents, and\r\nsome, perhaps, a girl--that is not much, for at our age the influence\r\nof parents is at its weakest and girls have not yet got a hold over\r\nus.  Besides this there was little else--some enthusiasm, a few\r\nhobbies, and our school.  Beyond this our life did not extend.  And\r\nof this nothing remains.\r\n\r\nKantorek would say that we stood on the threshold of life.  And so it\r\nwould seem.  We had as yet taken no root.  The war swept us away.\r\nFor the others, the older men, it is but an interruption.  They are\r\nable to think beyond it.  We, however, have been gripped by it and do\r\nnot know what the end may be.  We know only that in some strange and\r\nmelancholy way we have become a waste land.  All the same, we are not\r\noften sad.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nThough Müller would be delighted to have Kemmerich's boots, he is\r\nreally quite as sympathetic as another who could not bear to think of\r\nsuch a thing for grief.  He merely sees things clearly.  Were\r\nKemmerich able to make any use of the boots, then Müller would rather\r\ngo barefoot over barbed wire than scheme how to get hold of them.\r\nBut as it is the boots are quite inappropriate to Kemmerich's\r\ncircumstances, whereas Müller can make good use of them.  Kemmerich\r\nwill die; it is immaterial who gets them.  Why, then, should Müller\r\nnot succeed to them? he has more right than a hospital orderly.  When\r\nKemmerich is dead it will be too late.  Therefore Müller is already\r\non the watch.\r\n\r\nWe have lost all sense of other considerations, because they are\r\nartificial.  Only the facts are real and important for us.  And good\r\nboots are scarce.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nOnce it was different.  When we went to the district-commandant to\r\nenlist, we were a class of twenty young men, many of whom proudly\r\nshaved for the first time before going to the barracks.  We had no\r\ndefinite plans for our future.  Our thoughts of a career and\r\noccupation were as yet of too unpractical a character to furnish any\r\nscheme of life.  We were still crammed full of vague ideas which gave\r\nto life, and to the war also, an ideal and almost romantic character.\r\nWe were trained in the army for ten weeks and in this time more\r\nprofoundly influenced than by ten years at school.  We learned that a\r\nbright button is weightier than four volumes of Schopenhauer.  At\r\nfirst astonished, then embittered, and finally indifferent, we\r\nrecognized that what matters is not the mind but the boot brush, not\r\nintelligence but the system, not freedom but drill.  We became\r\nsoldiers with eagerness and enthusiasm, but they have done everything\r\nto knock that out of us.  After three weeks it was no longer\r\nincomprehensible to us that a braided postman should have more\r\nauthority over us than had formerly our parents, our teachers, and\r\nthe whole gamut of culture from Plato to Goethe.  With our young,\r\nawakened eyes we saw that the classical conception of the Fatherland\r\nheld by our teachers resolved itself here into a renunciation of\r\npersonality such as one would not ask of the meanest\r\nservant--salutes, springing to attention, parade-marches, presenting\r\narms, right wheel, left wheel, clicking the heels, insults, and a\r\nthousand pettifogging details.  We had fancied our task would be\r\ndifferent, only to find we were to be trained for heroism as though\r\nwe were circus-ponies.  But we soon accustomed ourselves to it.  We\r\nlearned in fact that some part of these things was necessary, but the\r\nrest merely show.  Soldiers have a fine nose for such distinctions.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nBy threes and fours our class was scattered over the platoons amongst\r\nFrisian fishermen, peasants, and labourers with whom we soon made\r\nfriends.  Kropp, Müller, Kemmerich, and I went to No. 9 platoon under\r\nCorporal Himmelstoss.\r\n\r\nHe had the reputation of being the strictest disciplinarian in the\r\ncamp, and was proud of it.  He was a small undersized fellow with a\r\nfoxy, waxed moustache, who had seen twelve years service and was in\r\ncivil life a postman.  He had a special dislike for Kropp, Tjaden,\r\nWesthus, and me, because he sensed a quiet defiance.\r\n\r\nI have remade his bed fourteen times in one morning.  Each time he\r\nhad some fault to find and pulled it to pieces.  I have kneaded a\r\npair of prehistoric boots that were as hard as iron for twenty\r\nhours--with intervals of course--until they became as soft as butter\r\nand not even Himmelstoss could find anything more to do to them;\r\nunder his orders I have scrubbed out the Corporals' Mess with a\r\ntooth-brush.  Kropp and I were given the job of clearing the\r\nbarrack-square of snow with a hand-broom and a dust-pan, and we would\r\nhave gone on till we were frozen had not a lieutenant accidentally\r\nappeared who sent us off, and hauled Himmelstoss over the coals.  But\r\nthe only result of this was to make Himmelstoss hate us more.  For\r\nsix weeks consecutively I did guard every Sunday and was hut-orderly\r\nfor the same length of time.  With full pack and rifle I have had to\r\npractise on a soft, wet, newly ploughed field the \"Prepare to\r\nadvance, advance!\" and the \"Lie down!\" until I was one lump of mud\r\nand finally collapsed.  Four hours later I had to report to\r\nHimmelstoss with my clothes scrubbed clean, my hands chafed and\r\nbleeding.  Together with Kropp, Westhus, and Tjaden I have stood at\r\nattention in a hard frost without gloves for a quarter of an hour at\r\na stretch, while Himmelstoss watched for the slightest movement of\r\nour bare fingers on the steel barrel of the rifle.  I have run eight\r\ntimes from the top floor of the barracks down to the courtyard in my\r\nshirt at two o'clock in the morning because my drawers projected\r\nthree inches beyond the edge of the stool on which one had to stack\r\nall one's things.  Alongside me ran the corporal, Himmelstoss, and\r\ntrod on my bare toes.  At bayonet-practice I had constantly to fight\r\nwith Himmelstoss, I with a heavy iron weapon whilst he had a handy\r\nwooden one with which he easily struck my arms till they were black\r\nand blue.  Once, indeed, I became so infuriated that I ran at him\r\nblindly and gave him a mighty jab in the stomach and knocked him\r\ndown.  When he reported me the company commander laughed at him and\r\ntold him he ought to keep his eyes open; he understood Himmelstoss,\r\nand apparently was not displeased at his discomfiture.  I became a\r\npast master on the parallel bars and strove to surpass my instructor\r\nat physical jerks;--we have trembled at the mere sound of his voice,\r\nbut this runaway post-horse never got the better of us.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday as Kropp and I were lugging a latrine-bucket on a pole\r\nacross the barrack-yard, Himmelstoss came by, all polished up and\r\nspry for going out.  He planted himself in front of us and asked how\r\nwe liked the job.  In spite of ourselves we tripped and emptied the\r\nbucket over his legs.  He raved, but the limit had been reached.\r\n\r\n\"That means clink,\" he yelled.\r\n\r\nBut Kropp had had enough.  \"There'll be an inquiry first,\" he said,\r\n\"and then we'll unload.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mind how you speak to a non-commissioned officer!\" bawled\r\nHimmelstoss.  \"Have you lost your senses?  You wait till you're\r\nspoken to.  What will you do, anyway?\"\r\n\r\n\"Show you up, Corporal,\" said Kropp, his thumbs in line with the\r\nseams of his trousers.\r\n\r\nHimmelstoss saw what we meant and went off without saying a word.\r\nBut before he disappeared he growled: \"You'll drink this!\"--but it\r\nwas the end of his authority.  He tried it on once more in the\r\nploughed field with his \"Prepare to advance, advance\" and \"Lie down.\"\r\nWe obeyed each order, since an order's an order and has to be obeyed.\r\nBut we did it so slowly that Himmelstoss became desperate.  Carefully\r\nwe went down on our knees, then on our hands, and so on; in the\r\nmeantime, quite infuriated, he had given another command.  But before\r\nwe had even begun to sweat he was hoarse.  After that he left us in\r\npeace.  He did indeed always refer to us as swine, but there was,\r\nnevertheless, a certain respect in his tone.\r\n\r\nThere were many other staff corporals, the majority of whom were more\r\ndecent.  But above all each of them wanted to keep his good job there\r\nat home as long as possible, and that he could do only by being\r\nstrict with the recruits.\r\n\r\nPractically every conceivable polishing job in the entire camp fell\r\nto us and we often howled with rage.  Many of us became ill through\r\nit; Wolf actually died of inflammation of the lung.  But we would\r\nhave felt ridiculous had we hauled down our colours.  We became hard,\r\nsuspicious, pitiless, vicious, tough--and that was good; for these\r\nattributes had been entirely lacking in us.  Had we gone into the\r\ntrenches without this period of training most of us would certainly\r\nhave gone mad.  Only thus were we prepared for what awaited us.  We\r\ndid not break down, but endured; our twenty years, which made many\r\nanother thing so grievous, helped us in this.  But by far the most\r\nimportant was that it awakened in us a strong, practical sense of\r\n_esprit de corps_, which in the field developed into the finest thing\r\nthat arose out of the war--comradeship.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nI sit by Kemmerich's bed.  He is sinking steadily.  Around us is a\r\ngreat commotion.  A hospital train has arrived and the wounded fit to\r\nbe moved are being selected.  The doctor passes by Kemmerich's bed\r\nwithout once looking at him.\r\n\r\n\"Next time, Franz,\" I say.\r\n\r\nHe raises himself on the pillow with his elbows.  \"They have\r\namputated my leg.\"\r\n\r\nHe knows it too then.  I nod and answer: \"You must be thankful you've\r\ncome off with that.\"\r\n\r\nHe is silent.\r\n\r\nI resume: \"It might have been both legs, Franz.  Wegeler has lost his\r\nright arm.  That's much worse.  Besides, you will be going home.\"  He\r\nlooks at me.  \"Do you think so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think so?\" he repeats.\r\n\r\n\"Sure, Franz.  Once you've got over the operation.\"\r\n\r\nHe beckons me to bend down.  I stoop over him and he whispers: \"I\r\ndon't think so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't talk rubbish, Franz, in a couple of days you'll see for\r\nyourself.  What is it anyway--an amputated leg?  here they patch up\r\nfar worse things than that.\"\r\n\r\nHe lifts one hand.  \"Look here though, these fingers.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the result of the operation.  Just eat decently and you'll\r\nsoon be well again.  Do they look after you properly?\"\r\n\r\nHe points to a dish that is still half full.  I get excited.  \"Franz,\r\nyou must eat.  Eating is the main thing.  That looks good too.\"\r\n\r\nHe turns away.  After a pause he says slowly: \"I wanted to become a\r\nhead-forester once.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you may still,\" I assure him.  \"There are splendid artificial\r\nlimbs now, you'd hardly know there was anything missing.  They are\r\nfixed on to the muscles.  You can move the fingers and work and even\r\nwrite with an artificial hand.  And besides, they will always be\r\nmaking new improvements.\"\r\n\r\nFor a while he lies still.  Then he says: \"You can take my lace-up\r\nboots with you for Müller.\"\r\n\r\nI nod and wonder what to say to encourage him.  His lips have fallen\r\naway, his mouth has become larger, his teeth stick out and look as\r\nthough they were made of chalk.  The flesh melts, the forehead bulges\r\nmore prominently, the cheek-bones protrude.  The skeleton is working\r\nitself through.  The eyes are already sunken in.  In a couple of\r\nhours it will be over.\r\n\r\nHe is not the first that I have seen thus; but we grew up together\r\nand that always makes it a bit different.  I have copied his essays.\r\nAt school he used to wear a brown coat with a belt and shiny sleeves.\r\nHe was the only one of us, too, who could do the giant's turn on the\r\nhorizontal bar.  His hair flew in his face like silk when he did it.\r\nKantorek was proud of him for it.  But he couldn't endure cigarettes.\r\nHis skin was very white; he had something of the girl about him.\r\n\r\nI glance at my boots.  They are big and clumsy, the breeches are\r\ntucked into them, and standing up one looks well-built and powerful\r\nin these great drain-pipes.  But when we go bathing and strip,\r\nsuddenly we have slender legs again and slight shoulders.  We are no\r\nlonger soldiers but little more than boys; no one would believe that\r\nwe could carry packs.  It is a strange moment when we stand naked;\r\nthen we become civilians, and almost feel ourselves to be so.  When\r\nbathing Franz Kemmerich looked as slight and frail as a child.  There\r\nhe lies now--but why?  The whole world ought to pass by this bed and\r\nsay: \"That is Franz Kemmerich, nineteen and a half years old, he\r\ndoesn't want to die.  Let him not die!\"\r\n\r\nMy thoughts become confused.  This atmosphere of carbolic and\r\ngangrene clogs the lungs, it is a thick gruel, it suffocates.\r\n\r\nIt grows dark.  Kemmerich's face changes colour, it lifts from the\r\npillow and is so pale that it gleams.  The mouth moves slightly.  I\r\ndraw near to him.  He whispers: \"If you find my watch, send it\r\nhome----\"\r\n\r\nI do not reply.  It is no use any more.  No one can console him.  I\r\nam wretched with helplessness.  This forehead with its hollow\r\ntemples, this mouth that is now merely a slit, this sharp nose!  And\r\nthe fat, weeping woman at home to whom I must write.  If only the\r\nletter were sent off already!\r\n\r\nHospital-orderlies go to and fro with bottles and pails.  One of them\r\ncomes up, casts a glance at Kemmerich and goes away again.  You can\r\nsee he is waiting, apparently he wants the bed.\r\n\r\nI bend over Franz and talk to him as though that could save him:\r\n\"Perhaps you will go to the convalescent home at Klosterberg, among\r\nthe villas, Franz.  Then you can look out from the window across the\r\nfields to the two trees on the horizon.  It is the loveliest time of\r\nthe year now, when the corn ripens; at evening the fields in the\r\nsunlight look like mother-of-pearl.  And the lane of poplars by the\r\nKlosterbach, where we used to catch sticklebacks!  You can build an\r\naquarium again and keep fish in it, and you can go out without asking\r\nanyone, you can even play the piano if you want to.\"\r\n\r\nI lean down over his face which lies in the shadow.  He still\r\nbreathes, lightly.  His face is wet, he is crying.  What a fine mess\r\nI have made of it with my foolish talk!\r\n\r\n\"But Franz\"--I put my arm round his shoulder and put my face against\r\nhis.  \"Will you sleep now?\"\r\n\r\nHe does not answer.  The tears run down his cheeks.  I would like to\r\nwipe them away but my handkerchief is too dirty.\r\n\r\nAn hour passes.  I sit tensely and watch his every movement in case\r\nhe may perhaps say something.  What if he were to open his mouth and\r\ncry out!  But he only weeps, his head turned aside.  He does not\r\nspeak of his mother or his brothers and sisters.  He says nothing;\r\nall that lies behind him; he is entirely alone now with his little\r\nlife of nineteen years, and cries because it leaves him.  This is the\r\nmost disturbing and hardest parting that ever I have seen, although\r\nit was pretty bad too with Tiedjen, who called for his mother--a big\r\nbear of a fellow who, with wild eyes full of terror, held off the\r\ndoctor from his bed with a dagger until he collapsed.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Kemmerich groans and begins to gurgle.\r\n\r\nI jump up, stumble outside and demand:\r\n\r\n\"Where is the doctor?  Where is the doctor?\"\r\n\r\nAs I catch sight of the white apron I seize hold of it: \"Come quick,\r\nFranz Kemmerich is dying.\"\r\n\r\nHe frees himself and asks an orderly standing by: \"Which will that\r\nbe?\"\r\n\r\nHe says: \"Bed 26, amputated thigh.\"\r\n\r\nHe sniffs: \"How should I know anything about it, I've amputated five\r\nlegs to-day\"; he shoves me away, says to the hospital-orderly \"You\r\nsee to it,\" and runs off to the operating room.\r\n\r\nI tremble with rage as I go along with the orderly.  The man looks at\r\nme and says: \"One operation after another since five o'clock this\r\nmorning.  You know to-day alone there have been sixteen deaths--yours\r\nis the seventeenth.  There will probably be twenty altogether----\"\r\n\r\nI become faint, all at once I cannot do any more.  I won't revile any\r\nmore, it is senseless, I could drop down and never rise up again.\r\n\r\nWe are by Kemmerich's bed.  He is dead.  The face is still wet from\r\nthe tears.  The eyes are half open and yellow like old horn buttons.\r\n\r\nThe orderly pokes me in the ribs.  \"Are you taking his things with\r\nyou?\" I nod.\r\n\r\nHe goes on: \"We must take him away at once, we want the bed.  Outside\r\nthey are lying on the floor.\"\r\n\r\nI collect the things, untie Kemmerich's identification disc and take\r\nit away.  The orderly asks about the pay-book, I say that it is\r\nprobably in the orderly-room, and go.  Behind me they are already\r\nhauling Franz on to a water-proof sheet.\r\n\r\nOutside the door I am aware of the darkness and the wind as a\r\ndeliverance. I breathe as deep as I can, and feel the breeze in my\r\nface, warm and soft as never before. Thoughts of girls, of flowery\r\nmeadows, of white clouds suddenly come into my head. My feet begin to\r\nmove forward in my boots, I go quicker, I run. Soldiers pass by me, I\r\nhear their voices without understanding. The earth is streaming with\r\nforces which pour into me through the soles of my feet. The night\r\ncrackles electrically, the front thunders like a concert of drums. My\r\nlimbs move supplely, I feel my joints strong, I breathe the air deeply.\r\nThe night lives, I live. I feel a hunger, greater than comes from the\r\nbelly alone.\r\n\r\nMüller stands in front of the hut and waits for me.  I give him the\r\nboots.  We go in and he tries them on.  They fit well.\r\n\r\nHe roots among his supplies and offers me a fine piece of saveloy.\r\nWith it goes hot tea and rum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nReinforcements have arrived.  The vacancies have been filled and the\r\nsacks of straw are already laid out in the huts.  Some of them are\r\nold hands, but there are twenty-five men of a later draft from the\r\nbase.  They are about two years younger than us.  Kropp nudges me:\r\n\"Seen the infants?\"\r\n\r\nI nod.  We stick out our chests, shave in the open, shove our hands\r\nin our pockets, inspect the recruits and feel ourselves to be\r\nstone-age veterans.\r\n\r\nKatczinsky joins us.  We stroll past the horse-boxes and go over to\r\nthe reinforcements, who have already been issued with gas-masks and\r\ncoffee.\r\n\r\n\"Long time since you've had anything decent to eat, eh?\" Kat asks one\r\nof the youngsters.\r\n\r\nHe grimaces.  \"For breakfast, turnip-bread--lunch,\r\nturnip-stew--supper, turnip-cutlets and turnip-salad.\"  Kat gives a\r\nknowing whistle.\r\n\r\n\"Bread made of turnips?  You've been in luck, it's nothing new for it\r\nto be made of sawdust.  But what do you say to haricot beans?  Have\r\nsome?\"\r\n\r\nThe youngster turns red: \"You can't kid me.\"\r\n\r\nKatczinsky merely says: \"Fetch your mess-tin.\"\r\n\r\nWe follow curiously.  He takes us to a tub beside his straw sack.  It\r\nis nearly half full of a stew of beef and beans.  Katczinsky plants\r\nhimself in front of it like a general and says:\r\n\r\n\"Sharp eyes and light fingers!  That's what the Prussians say.\"\r\n\r\nWe are surprised.  \"Great guts, Kat, how did you come by that?\" I ask\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Ginger was glad I took it.  I gave him three pieces of parachute\r\nsilk for it.  Cold beans taste fine, too.\"\r\n\r\nGrudgingly he gives the youngster a portion and says:\r\n\r\n\"Next time you come with your mess-tin have a cigar or a chew of\r\ntobacco in your other hand.  Get me?\"  Then he turns to us.  \"You get\r\noff scot free, of course.\"\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nKatczinsky never goes short; he has a sixth sense.  There are such\r\npeople everywhere but one does not appreciate it at first.  Every\r\ncompany has one or two.  Katczinsky is the smartest I know.  By trade\r\nhe is a cobbler, I believe, but that hasn't anything to do with it;\r\nhe understands all trades.  It's a good thing to be friends with him,\r\nas Kropp and I are, and Haie Westhus too, more or less.  But Haie is\r\nrather the executive arm operating under Kat's orders when things\r\ncome to blows.  For that he has his qualifications.\r\n\r\nFor example, we land at night in some entirely unknown spot, a sorry\r\nhole, that has been eaten out to the very walls.  We are quartered in\r\na small dark factory adapted to the purpose.  There are beds in it,\r\nor rather bunks--a couple of wooden beams over which wire netting is\r\nstretched.\r\n\r\nWire netting is hard.  And there's nothing to put on it.  Our\r\nwaterproof sheets are too thin.  We use our blankets to cover\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nKat looks at the place and then says to Haie Westhus: \"Come with me.\"\r\nThey go off to explore.  Half an hour later they are back again with\r\narms full of straw.  Kat has found a horse-box with straw in it.  Now\r\nwe might sleep if we weren't so terribly hungry.\r\n\r\nKropp asks an artilleryman who has been some time in this\r\nneighbourhood: \"Is there a canteen anywhere abouts?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there a what?\" he laughs.  \"There's nothing to be had here.  You\r\nwon't find so much as a crust of bread here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aren't there any inhabitants here at all then?\"\r\n\r\nHe spits.  \"Yes, a couple.  But they mostly loaf round the cook house\r\nand beg.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a bad business!--Then we'll have to pull in our belts and\r\nwait till the rations come up in the morning.\"\r\n\r\nBut I see Kat has put on his cap.\r\n\r\n\"Where to, Kat?\" I ask.\r\n\r\n\"Just to explore the place a bit.\"  He strolls off.  The artilleryman\r\ngrins scornfully.  \"Let him explore!  But don't be too hopeful about\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nDisappointed we lie down and consider whether we couldn't have a go\r\nat the iron rations.  But it's too risky; so we try to get a wink of\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nKropp divides a cigarette and hands me half.  Tjaden gives an account\r\nof his national dish--broad-beans and bacon.  He despises it when not\r\nflavoured with bog-myrtle, and, \"for God's sake, let it all be cooked\r\ntogether, not the potatoes, the beans, and the bacon separately.\"\r\nSomeone growls that he will pound Tjaden into bog-myrtle if he\r\ndoesn't shut up.  Then all becomes quiet in the big room--only the\r\ncandles flickering from the necks of a couple of bottles and the\r\nartilleryman spitting every now and then.\r\n\r\nWe stir a bit as the door opens and Kat appears.  I think I must be\r\ndreaming; he has two loaves of bread under his arm and a\r\nblood-stained sandbag full of horse-flesh in his hand.  The\r\nartilleryman's pipe drops from his mouth.  He feels the bread.  \"Real\r\nbread, by God! and still hot too!\"\r\n\r\nKat gives no explanation.  He has the bread, the rest doesn't matter.\r\nI'm sure that if he were planted down in the middle of the desert, in\r\nhalf an hour he would have gathered together a supper of roast meat,\r\ndates, and wine.\r\n\r\n\"Cut some wood,\" he says curtly to Haie.\r\n\r\nThen he hauls out a frying-pan from under his coat, and a handful of\r\nsalt as well as a lump of fat from his pocket.  He has thought of\r\neverything.  Haie makes a fire on the floor.  It lights up the empty\r\nroom of the factory.  We climb out of bed.\r\n\r\nThe artilleryman hesitates.  He wonders whether to praise Kat and so\r\nperhaps gain a little for himself.  But Katczinsky doesn't even see\r\nhim, he might as well be thin air.  He goes off cursing.\r\n\r\nKat knows the way to roast horse-flesh so that it's tender.  It\r\nshouldn't be put straight into the pan, that makes it tough.  It\r\nshould be boiled first in a little water.  With our knives we squat\r\nround in a circle and fill our bellies.\r\n\r\nThat is Kat.  If for but one hour in a year something eatable were to\r\nbe had in some one place only, within that hour, as if moved by a\r\nvision, he would put on his cap, go out and walk directly there, as\r\nthough following a compass, and find it.\r\n\r\nHe finds everything--if it is cold, a small stove and wood, hay and\r\nstraw, a table and chairs--but above all food.  It is uncanny; one\r\nwould think he conjured it out of the air.  His masterpiece was four\r\nboxes of lobsters.  Admittedly we would rather have had a good beef\r\nsteak.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nWe have settled ourselves on the sunny side of the hut.  There is a\r\nsmell of tar, of summer, and of sweaty feet.  Kat sits beside me.  He\r\nwants to talk.  To-day we have been practising saluting because\r\nTjaden failed to salute a major.  Kat can't get it out of his head.\r\n\r\n\"You see, we are losing the war because we can salute too well,\" he\r\nsays.\r\n\r\nKropp stalks up, with his breeches rolled up and his feet bare.  He\r\nlays out his washed socks to dry on the grass.  Kat turns his eyes to\r\nheaven, lets off a mighty fart, and says apologetically: \"Every\r\nlittle bean must be heard as well as seen.\"\r\n\r\nThe two begin to argue.  At the same time they lay a bottle of beer\r\non the result of an air-fight that's going on above us.  Katczinsky\r\nwon't budge from the opinion, which as an old Front-hog, he rhymes:\r\n\r\n  Give 'em all the same grub and all the same pay\r\n  And the war would be over and done in a day.\r\n\r\n\r\nKropp on the other hand is a thinker.  He proposes that a declaration\r\nof war should be a kind of popular festival with entrance-tickets and\r\nbands, like a bull fight.  Then in the arena the ministers and\r\ngenerals of the two countries, dressed in bathing-drawers and armed\r\nwith clubs, can have it out among themselves.  Whoever survives, his\r\ncountry wins.  That would be much simpler and more just than this\r\narrangement, where the wrong people do the fighting.\r\n\r\nThe subject is dropped.  Then the conversation turns to drill.\r\n\r\nA picture comes before me.  Burning midday in the barrack-yard.  The\r\nheat hangs over the square.  The barracks are deserted.  Everything\r\nsleeps.  All one hears is the drummers practising; they have\r\ninstalled themselves anywhere and practise brokenly, dully,\r\nmonotonously.  What a concord!  Midday heat, barrack-square, and\r\ndrummers beating!\r\n\r\nThe windows of the barracks are empty and dark.  From some of them\r\ntrousers are hanging to dry.  The rooms are cool and one looks toward\r\nthem longingly.\r\n\r\nO dark, musty platoon huts, with the iron bedsteads, the chequered\r\nbedding, the lockers and the stools!  Even you can become the object\r\nof desire; out here you have a faint resemblance to home; your rooms,\r\nfull of the smell of stale food, sleep, smoke, and clothes!\r\n\r\nKatczinsky paints it all in lively colours.  What would we not give\r\nto be able to go back to it!  But we must not pursue that line of\r\nthought any further.\r\n\r\nThose early morning hours of instruction--\"What are the parts of the\r\n98 rifle?\"--the midday hours of physical training--\"Pianist, forward!\r\nBy the right, quick march.  Report to the cook-house for\r\npotato-peeling.\"\r\n\r\nWe indulge in reminiscences.  Kropp laughs suddenly and says: \"Change\r\nat Löhne!\"\r\n\r\nThat was our corporal's favourite game.  Löhne is a railway junction.\r\nIn order that our fellows going on leave shouldn't get lost there,\r\nHimmelstoss used to practise the change in the barrack-room.  We had\r\nto learn that at Löhne, to reach the branch-line, we must pass\r\nthrough a subway.  The beds represented the subway and each man stood\r\nat attention on the left side of his bed.  Then came the command:\r\n\"Change at Löhne!\" and like lightning everyone scrambled under the\r\nbed to the opposite side.  We practised this for a whole hour----\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the German aeroplane has been shot down.  Like a comet it\r\nbursts into a streamer of smoke and falls headlong.  Kropp has lost\r\nthe bottle of beer.  Disgruntled he counts out the money from his\r\nwallet.\r\n\r\n\"Surely Himmelstoss was a very different fellow as a postman,\" say I,\r\nafter Albert's disappointment has subsided.  \"Then how does it come\r\nthat he's such a bully as a drill-sergeant?\"\r\n\r\nThe question revives Kropp, more particularly as he hears there's no\r\nmore beer in the canteen.  \"It's not only Himmelstoss, there are lots\r\nof them.  As sure as they get a stripe or a star they become\r\ndifferent men, just as though they'd swallowed concrete.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the uniform,\" I suggest.\r\n\r\n\"Roughly speaking it is,\" says Kat, and prepares for a long speech;\r\n\"but the root of the matter lies elsewhere.  For instance, if you\r\ntrain a dog to eat potatoes and then afterwards put a piece of meat\r\nin front of him, he'll snap at it, it's his nature.  And if you give\r\na man a little bit of authority he behaves just the same way, he\r\nsnaps at it too.  The things are precisely the same.  In himself man\r\nis essentially a beast, only he butters it over like a slice of bread\r\nwith a little decorum.  The army is based on that; one man must\r\nalways have power over the other.  The mischief is merely that each\r\none has much too much power.  A non-com. can torment a private, a\r\nlieutenant a non-com., a captain a lieutenant, until he goes mad.\r\nAnd because they know they can, they all soon acquire the habit more\r\nor less.  Take a simple case: we are marching back from the\r\nparade-ground dog-tired.  Then comes the order to sing.  We are glad\r\nenough to be able to trail arms but we sing spiritlessly.  At once\r\nthe company is turned about and has to do another hour's drill as\r\npunishment.  On the march back the order to sing is given again, and\r\nonce more we start.  Now what's the use of all that?  It's simply\r\nthat the company commander's head has been turned by having so much\r\npower.  And nobody blames him.  On the contrary, he is praised for\r\nbeing strict.  That, of course, is only a trifling instance, but it\r\nholds also in very different affairs.  Now I ask you: Let a man be\r\nwhatever you like in peace-time, what occupation is there in which he\r\ncan behave like that without getting a crack on the nose?  He can\r\nonly do that in the army.  It goes to the heads of them all, you see.\r\nAnd the more insignificant a man has been in civil life the worse it\r\ntakes him.\"\r\n\r\n\"They say, of course, there must be discipline,\" ventures Kropp\r\nmeditatively.\r\n\r\n\"True,\" growls Kat, \"they always do.  And it may be so; still it\r\noughtn't to become an abuse.  But you try to explain that to a\r\nblacksmith or a labourer or a workman, you try to make that clear to\r\na simple tommy--and that's what most of them are here.  All he\r\nunderstands is that he has been properly trained so that when he\r\ncomes up to the front he thinks he knows exactly what he should do in\r\nevery circumstance and what not.  It's simply amazing, I tell you,\r\nthat the ordinary soldier survives so long up here in the front-line.\r\nSimply amazing!\"\r\n\r\nNo one protests.  Everyone knows that drill ceases only in the\r\nfront-line and begins again a few miles behind, with all the\r\nabsurdities of saluting and parade.  It is an iron law that the\r\nsoldier must be employed under every circumstance.\r\n\r\nHere Tjaden comes up with a flushed face.  He is so excited that he\r\nstutters.  Beaming with satisfaction he stammers out: \"Himmelstoss is\r\non his way.  He's coming to the front!\"\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nTjaden has a special grudge against Himmelstoss, because of the way\r\nhe educated him in the barracks.  Tjaden wets his bed, he does it at\r\nnight in his sleep.  Himmelstoss maintained that it was sheer\r\nlaziness and invented a method worthy of himself for curing Tjaden.\r\n\r\nHe hunted up another piss-a-bed, named Kindervater, from a\r\nneighbouring hut, and quartered him with Tjaden.  In the huts there\r\nwere the usual bunks, one above the other in pairs, with mattresses\r\nof wire-netting.  Himmelstoss put these two so that one occupied the\r\nupper and the other the lower bunk.  The man underneath was of course\r\ndisgusted.  The next night they were changed over and the lower one\r\nput on top so that he could retaliate.  That was Himmelstoss's system\r\nof self-education.\r\n\r\nThe idea was low but not ill-conceived.  Unfortunately it\r\naccomplished nothing because the first assumption was wrong: it was\r\nnot laziness in either of them.  Anyone who looked at their sallow\r\nskin could see that.  The matter ended in one of them always sleeping\r\non the floor, where he frequently caught cold.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Haie sits down beside us.  He winks at me and rubs his paws\r\nthoughtfully.  We once spent the finest day of our army-life\r\ntogether--the day before we left for the front.  We had been allotted\r\nto one of the recently formed regiments, but were first to be sent\r\nback for equipment to the garrison, not to the reinforcement-depot,\r\nof course, but to another barracks.  We were due to leave next\r\nmorning early.  In the evening we prepared ourselves to square\r\naccounts with Himmelstoss.\r\n\r\nWe had sworn for weeks past to do this.  Kropp had even gone so far\r\nas to propose entering the postal service in peace-time in order to\r\nbe Himmelstoss's superior when he became a postman again.  He\r\nrevelled in the thought of how he would grind him.  It was this that\r\nmade it impossible for him to crush us altogether--we always reckoned\r\nthat later, at the end of the war, we would have our revenge on him.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime we decided to give him a good hiding.  What could he\r\ndo to us anyhow if he didn't recognize us and we left early the next\r\nmorning?\r\n\r\nWe knew which pub he used to visit every evening.  Returning to the\r\nbarracks he had to go along a dark, uninhabited road.  There we\r\nwaited for him behind a pile of stones.  I had a bed-cover with me.\r\nWe trembled with suspense, hoping he would be alone.  At last we\r\nheard his footstep, which we recognized easily, so often had we heard\r\nit in the mornings as the door flew open and he bawled: \"Get up!\"\r\n\r\n\"Alone?\" whispered Kropp.\r\n\r\n\"Alone.\"\r\n\r\nI slipped round the pile of stones with Tjaden.\r\n\r\nHimmelstoss seemed a little elevated; he was singing.  His\r\nbelt-buckle gleamed.  He came on unsuspectingly.\r\n\r\nWe seized the bed-cover, made a quick leap, threw it over his head\r\nfrom behind and pulled it round him so that he stood there in a white\r\nsack unable to raise his arms.  The singing stopped.  The next moment\r\nHaie Westhus was there, and spreading out his arms he shoved us back\r\nin order to be first in.  He put himself in position with evident\r\nsatisfaction, raised his arm like a signal-mast and his hand like a\r\ncoal-shovel and fetched such a blow on the white sack as would have\r\nfelled an ox.\r\n\r\nHimmelstoss was thrown down, he rolled five yards and started to\r\nyell.  But we were prepared for that and had brought a cushion.  Haie\r\nsquatted down, laid the cushion on his knees, felt where\r\nHimmelstoss's head was and pressed it down on the pillow.\r\nImmediately his voice was muffled.  Haie let him get a gasp of air\r\nevery so often, when he would give a mighty yell that was immediately\r\nhushed.\r\n\r\nTjaden unbuttoned Himmelstoss's braces and pulled down his trousers,\r\nholding the whip meantime in his teeth.  Then he stood up and set to\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nIt was a wonderful picture: Himmelstoss on the ground; Haie bending\r\nover him with a fiendish grin and his mouth open with blood-lust,\r\nHimmelstoss's head on his knees; then the convulsed, striped drawers,\r\nthe knock knees, executing at every blow most original movements in\r\nthe lowered breeches, and towering over them like a woodcutter the\r\nindefatigable Tjaden.  In the end we had to drag him away to get our\r\nturn.\r\n\r\nFinally Haie stood Himmelstoss on his feet again and gave one last\r\npersonal remonstrance.  As he stretched out his right arm preparatory\r\nto giving him a box on the ear he looked as if he were going to reach\r\ndown a star.\r\n\r\nHimmelstoss staggered.  Haie stood him up again, made ready and\r\nfetched him a second, well-aimed beauty with the left hand.\r\nHimmelstoss yelled and fell down on all fours cursing.  His striped\r\npostman's backside gleamed in the moonlight.\r\n\r\nWe disappeared at full speed.\r\n\r\nHaie looked round once again and said wrathfully, satisfied and\r\nrather mysteriously:\r\n\r\n\"Revenge is black-pudding.\"\r\n\r\nHimmelstoss ought to have been pleased; his saying that we should\r\neach educate one another had borne fruit for himself.  We had become\r\nsuccessful students of his method.\r\n\r\nHe never discovered whom he had to thank for the business.  At any\r\nrate he scored a bed-cover out of it; for when we returned a few\r\nhours later to look for it, it was no longer to be found.\r\n\r\nThat evening's work made us more or less content to leave next\r\nmorning.  And an old buffer was pleased to describe us as \"young\r\nheroes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nWe have to go up on wiring fatigue.  The motor lorries roll up after\r\ndark.  We climb in.  It is a warm evening and the twilight seems like\r\na canopy under whose shelter we feel drawn together.  Even the stingy\r\nTjaden gives me a cigarette and then a light.\r\n\r\nWe stand jammed in together, shoulder to shoulder, there is no room\r\nto sit.  But we do not expect that.  Müller is in a good mood for\r\nonce; he is wearing his new boots.\r\n\r\nThe engines drone, the lorries bump and rattle.  The roads are worn\r\nand full of holes.  We dare not show a light so we lurch along and\r\nare often almost pitched out.  That does not worry us, however.  It\r\ncan happen if it likes; a broken arm is better than a hole in the\r\nguts, and many a man would be thankful enough for such a chance of\r\nfinding his way home again.\r\n\r\nBeside us stream the munition-columns in long files.  They are making\r\nthe pace, they overtake us going forward.  We joke with them and they\r\nanswer back.\r\n\r\nA wall becomes visible, it belongs to a house which lies on the side\r\nof the road.  I suddenly prick up my ears.  Am I deceived?  Again I\r\nhear distinctly the cackle of geese.  A glance at Katczinsky--a\r\nglance from him to me; we understand one another.\r\n\r\n\"Kat, I hear some aspirants for the frying-pan over there.\"\r\n\r\nHe nods.  \"It will be attended to when we come back.  I have their\r\nnumber.\"\r\n\r\nOf course Kat has their number.  He knows all about every leg of\r\ngoose within a radius of fifteen miles.\r\n\r\nThe lorries arrive at the artillery lines.  The gun-emplacements are\r\ncamouflaged with bushes against aerial observation, and look like a\r\nkind of military Feast of the Tabernacles.  These branches might seem\r\ngay and cheerful were not cannon embowered there.\r\n\r\nThe air becomes acrid with the smoke of the guns and the fog.  The\r\nfumes of powder taste bitter on the tongue.  The roar of the guns\r\nmakes our lorry stagger, the reverberation rolls raging away to the\r\nrear, everything quakes.  Our faces change imperceptibly.  We are\r\nnot, indeed, in the front-line, but only in the reserves, yet in\r\nevery face can be read: This is the Front, now we are within its\r\nembrace.\r\n\r\nIt is not fear.  Men who have been up as often as we have become\r\nthick skinned.  Only the young recruits are agitated.  Kat explains\r\nto them: \"That was a twelve-inch.  You hear the explosion first and\r\nafterwards comes the sound of the gun.\"\r\n\r\nBut the hollow sound of the firing does not reach us.  It is\r\nswallowed up in the general murmur of the front.  Kat listens:\r\n\"There'll be a bombardment to-night.\"\r\n\r\nWe all listen.  The front is restless.  \"The Tommies are firing\r\nalready,\" says Kropp.\r\n\r\nThe shelling can be heard distinctly.  It is the English batteries to\r\nthe right of our section.  They are beginning an hour too soon.\r\nAccording to us they start punctually at ten o'clock.\r\n\r\n\"What's got them?\" says Müller, \"their clocks must be fast.\"\r\n\r\n\"There'll be a bombardment, I tell you, I can feel it in my bones.\"\r\nKat shrugs his shoulders.\r\n\r\nThree shells land beside us.  The burst of flame shoots across the\r\nfog, the fragments howl and drone.  We shiver and are glad to think\r\nthat we shall be back in the huts early in the morning.\r\n\r\nOur faces are neither paler nor more flushed than usual; they are not\r\nmore tense nor more flabby--and yet they are changed.  We feel that\r\nin our blood a contact has shot home.  That is no figure of speech;\r\nit is fact.  It is the front, the consciousness of the front, that\r\nmakes this contact.  The moment that the first shells whistle over\r\nand the air is rent with the explosions there is suddenly in our\r\nveins, in our hands, in our eyes a tense waiting, a watching, a\r\nheightened alertness, a strange sharpening of the senses.  The body\r\nwith one bound is in full readiness.\r\n\r\nIt often seems to me as though it were the vibrating, shuddering air\r\nthat with a noiseless leap springs upon us; or as though the front\r\nitself emitted an electric current which awakened unknown\r\nnerve-centres.\r\n\r\nEvery time it is the same.  We start out for the front plain\r\nsoldiers, either cheerful or gloomy: then come the first\r\ngun-emplacements and every word of our speech has a new ring.\r\n\r\nWhen Kat stands in front of the hut and says: \"There'll be a\r\nbombardment,\" that is merely his own opinion; but if he says it here,\r\nthen the sentence has the sharpness of a bayonet in the moonlight, it\r\ncuts clean through the thought, it thrusts nearer and speaks to this\r\nunknown thing that is awakened in us, a dark meaning--\"There'll be a\r\nbombardment.\"  Perhaps it is our inner and most secret life that\r\nshivers and falls on guard.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nTo me the front is a mysterious whirlpool.  Though I am in still\r\nwater far away from its centre, I feel the whirl of the vortex\r\nsucking me slowly, irresistibly, inescapably into itself.\r\n\r\nFrom the earth, from the air, sustaining forces pour into us--mostly\r\nfrom the earth.  To no man does the earth mean so much as to the\r\nsoldier.  When he presses himself down upon her long and powerfully,\r\nwhen he buries his face and his limbs deep in her from the fear of\r\ndeath by shell-fire, then she is his only friend, his brother, his\r\nmother; he stifles his terror and his cries in her silence and her\r\nsecurity; she shelters him and gives him a new lease of ten seconds\r\nof life, receives him again and often for ever.\r\n\r\nEarth!--Earth!--Earth!\r\n\r\nEarth with thy folds, and hollows and holes, into which a man may\r\nfling himself and crouch down!  In the spasm of terror, under the\r\nhailing of annihilation, in the bellowing death of the explosions, O\r\nEarth, thou grantest us the great resisting surge of new-won life.\r\nOur being, almost utterly carried away by the fury of the storm,\r\nstreams back through our hands from thee, and we, thy redeemed ones,\r\nbury ourselves in thee, and through the long minutes in a mute agony\r\nof hope bite into thee with our lips!\r\n\r\nAt the sound of the first droning of the shells we rush back, in one\r\npart of our being, a thousand years.  By the animal instinct that is\r\nawakened in us we are led and protected.  It is not conscious; it is\r\nfar quicker, much more sure, less fallible, than consciousness.  One\r\ncannot explain it.  A man is walking along without thought or\r\nheed;--suddenly he throws himself down on the ground and a storm of\r\nfragments flies harmlessly over him;--yet he cannot remember either\r\nto have heard the shell coming or to have thought of flinging himself\r\ndown.  But had he not abandoned himself to the impulse he would now\r\nbe a heap of mangled flesh.  It is this other, this second sight in\r\nus, that has thrown us to the ground and saved us, without our\r\nknowing how.  If it were not so, there would not be one man alive\r\nfrom Flanders to the Vosges.\r\n\r\nWe march up, moody or good-tempered soldiers--we reach the zone where\r\nthe front begins and become on the instant human animals.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nAn indigent looking wood receives us.  We pass by the soup-kitchens.\r\nUnder cover of the wood we climb out.  The lorries turn back.  They\r\nare to collect us again in the morning, before dawn.\r\n\r\nMist and the smoke of guns lie breast-high over the fields.  The moon\r\nis shining.  Along the road troops file.  Their helmets gleam softly\r\nin the moonlight.  The heads and the rifles stand out above the white\r\nmist, nodding heads, rocking carriers of guns.\r\n\r\nFarther on the mist ends.  Here the heads become figures; coats,\r\ntrousers, and boots appear out of the mist as from a milky pool.\r\nThey become a column.  The column marches on, straight ahead, the\r\nfigures resolve themselves into a block, individuals are no longer\r\nrecognizable, the dark wedge presses onward, fantastically topped by\r\nthe heads and weapons floating off on the milky pool.  A column--not\r\nmen at all.\r\n\r\nGuns and munition wagons are moving along a cross-road.  The backs of\r\nthe horses shine in the moonlight, their movements are beautiful,\r\nthey toss their heads, and their eyes gleam.  The guns and the wagons\r\nfloat before the dim background of the moonlit landscape, the riders\r\nin their steel helmets resemble knights of a forgotten time; it is\r\nstrangely beautiful and arresting.\r\n\r\nWe push on to the pioneer dump.  Some of us load our shoulders with\r\npointed and twisted iron stakes; others thrust smooth iron rods\r\nthrough rolls of wire and go off with them.  The burdens are awkward\r\nand heavy.\r\n\r\nThe ground becomes more broken.  From ahead come warnings: \"Look out,\r\ndeep shell-hole on the left\"--\"Mind, trenches\"----\r\n\r\nOur eyes peer out, our feet and our sticks feel in front of us before\r\nthey take the weight of the body.  Suddenly the line halts; I bump my\r\nface against the roll of wire carried by the man in front and curse.\r\n\r\nThere are some shell-smashed lorries in the road.  Another order:\r\n\"Cigarettes and pipes out,\" We are getting near the line.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime it has become pitch dark.  We skirt a small wood and\r\nthen have the front line immediately before us.\r\n\r\nAn uncertain, red glow spreads along the sky line from one end to the\r\nother.  It is in perpetual movement, punctuated with the bursts of\r\nflame from the muzzles of the batteries.  Balls of light rise up high\r\nabove it, silver and red spheres which explode and rain down in\r\nshowers of red, white, and green stars.  French rockets go up, which\r\nunfold a silk parachute to the air and drift slowly down.  They light\r\nup everything as bright as day, their light shines on us and we see\r\nour shadows sharply outlined on the ground.  They hover for the space\r\nof a minute before they burn out.  Immediately fresh ones shoot up to\r\nthe sky, and again green, red, and blue stars.\r\n\r\n\"Bombardment,\" says Kat.\r\n\r\nThe thunder of the guns swells to a single heavy roar and then breaks\r\nup again into separate explosions.  The dry bursts of the\r\nmachine-guns rattle.  Above us the air teems with invisible swift\r\nmovement, with howls, pipings, and hisses.  They are the smaller\r\nshells;--and amongst them, booming through the night like an organ,\r\ngo the great coal-boxes and the heavies.  They have a hoarse, distant\r\nbellow like a rutting stag and make their way high above the howl and\r\nwhistle of the smaller shells.  It reminds me of flocks of wild geese\r\nwhen I hear them.  Last autumn the wild geese flew day after day\r\nacross the path of the shells.\r\n\r\nThe searchlights begin to sweep the dark sky.  They slide along it\r\nlike gigantic tapering rulers.  One of them pauses, and quivers a\r\nlittle.  Immediately a second is beside him, a black insect is caught\r\nbetween them and tries to escape--the airman.  He hesitates, is\r\nblinded and falls.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nAt regular intervals we ram in the iron stakes.  Two men hold a roll\r\nand the others spool off the barbed wire.  It is that awful stuff\r\nwith close-set, long spikes.  I am not used to unrolling it and tear\r\nmy hand.\r\n\r\nAfter a few hours it is done.  But there is still some time before\r\nthe lorries come.  Most of us lie down and sleep.  I try also, but it\r\nhas turned too chilly.  Near to the sea one is constantly waked by\r\nthe cold.\r\n\r\nOnce I fall fast asleep.  Then waking suddenly with a start I do not\r\nknow where I am.  I see the stars, I see the rockets, and for a\r\nmoment have the impression that I have fallen asleep at a garden\r\nfête.  I don't know whether it is morning or evening, I lie in the\r\npale cradle of the twilight, and listen for soft words which will\r\ncome, soft and near--am I crying?  I put my hand to my eyes, it is so\r\nfantastic, am I a child?  Smooth skin:--it lasts only a second, then\r\nI recognize the silhouette of Katczinsky.  The old veteran, he sits\r\nquietly and smokes his pipe--a covered pipe of course.  When he sees\r\nI am awake, he says: \"That gave you a fright.  It was only a\r\nnose-cap, it landed in the bushes over there.\"\r\n\r\nI sit up, I feel myself strangely alone.  It's good Kat is there.  He\r\ngazes thoughtfully at the front and says:\r\n\r\n\"Mighty fine fire-works if they weren't so dangerous.\"\r\n\r\nOne lands behind us.  Two recruits jump up terrified.  A couple of\r\nminutes later another comes over, nearer this time.  Kat knocks out\r\nhis pipe.  \"It makes a glow.\"\r\n\r\nThen it begins in earnest.  We crawl away as well as we can in our\r\nhaste.  The next lands fair among us.  Two fellows cry out.  Green\r\nrockets shoot up on the sky-line.  Barrage.  The mud flies high,\r\nfragments whizz past.  The crack of the guns is heard long after the\r\nroar of the explosions.\r\n\r\nBeside us lies a fair-headed recruit in utter terror.  He has buried\r\nhis face in his hands, his helmet has fallen off.  I fish hold of it\r\nand try to put it back on his head.  He looks up, pushes the helmet\r\noff and like a child creeps under my arm, his head close to my\r\nbreast.  The little shoulders heave.  Shoulders just like\r\nKemmerich's.  I let him be.  So that the helmet should be of some use\r\nI stick it on his behind;--not for a jest, but out of consideration,\r\nsince that is his highest part.  And though there is plenty of meat\r\nthere, a shot in it can be damned painful.  Besides, a man has to lie\r\na whole month on his belly in the hospital, and afterwards he would\r\nbe almost sure to have a limp.\r\n\r\nIt's got someone pretty badly.  Cries are heard between the\r\nexplosions.\r\n\r\nAt last it grows quiet.  The fire has lifted over us and is now\r\ndropping on the reserves.  We risk a look.  Red rockets shoot up to\r\nthe sky.  Apparently there's an attack coming.\r\n\r\nWhere we are it is still quiet.  I sit up and shake the recruit by\r\nthe shoulder.  \"All over, kid!  It's all right this time.\"\r\n\r\nHe looks round him dazedly.  \"You'll get used to it soon,\" I tell him.\r\n\r\nHe sees his helmet and puts it on.  Gradually he comes to.  Then\r\nsuddenly he turns fiery red and looks confused.  Cautiously he\r\nreaches his hand to his behind and looks at me dismally.\r\n\r\nI understand at once: Gun-shy.  That wasn't the reason I had stuck\r\nhis helmet over it.  \"That's no disgrace,\" I reassure him: \"Many's\r\nthe man before you has had his pants full after the first\r\nbombardment.  Go behind that bush there and throw your underpants\r\naway.  Get along----\"\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nHe goes off.  Things become quieter, but the cries do not cease.\r\n\"What's up, Albert?\" I ask.\r\n\r\n\"A couple of columns over there have got it in the neck.\"\r\n\r\nThe cries continue.  It is not men, they could not cry so terribly.\r\n\r\n\"Wounded horses,\" says Kat.\r\n\r\nIt's unendurable.  It is the moaning of the world, it is the martyred\r\ncreation, wild with anguish, filled with terror, and groaning.\r\n\r\nWe are pale.  Detering stands up.  \"God!  For God's sake!  Shoot\r\nthem!\"\r\n\r\nHe is a farmer and very fond of horses.  It gets under his skin.\r\nThen as if deliberately the fire dies down again.  The screaming of\r\nthe beasts becomes louder.  One can no longer distinguish whence in\r\nthis now quiet, silvery landscape it comes; ghostly, invisible, it is\r\neverywhere, between heaven and earth it rolls on immeasurably.\r\nDetering raves and yells out: \"Shoot them!  Shoot them, can't you?\r\ndamn you again!\"\r\n\r\n\"They must look after the men first,\" says Kat quietly.\r\n\r\nWe stand up and try to see where it is.  If we could only see the\r\nanimals we should be able to endure it better.  Müller has a pair of\r\nglasses.  We see a dark group, bearers with stretchers, and larger\r\nblack clumps moving about.  Those are the wounded horses.  But not\r\nall of them.  Some gallop away in the distance, fall down, and then\r\nrun on farther.  The belly of one is ripped open, the guts trail out.\r\nHe becomes tangled in them and falls, then he stands up again.\r\n\r\nDetering raises his gun and aims.  Kat hits it up in the air.  \"Are\r\nyou mad----?\"\r\n\r\nDetering trembles and throws his rifle on the ground.\r\n\r\nWe sit down and hold our ears.  But this appalling noise, these\r\ngroans and screams penetrate, they penetrate everywhere.\r\n\r\nWe can bear almost anything.  But now the sweat breaks out on us.  We\r\nmust get up and run, no matter where, but where these cries can no\r\nlonger be heard.  And it is not men, only horses.\r\n\r\nFrom the dark group stretchers move off again.  Then single shots\r\ncrack out.  The black heap is convulsed and becomes thinner.  At\r\nlast!  But still it is not the end.  The men cannot overtake the\r\nwounded beasts which fly in their pain, their wide open mouths full\r\nof anguish.  One of the men goes down on his knee, a shot--one horse\r\ndrops--another.  The last one props himself on his forelegs and drags\r\nhimself round in a circle like a merry-go-round; squatting, it drags\r\nround in circles on its stiffened forelegs, apparently its back is\r\nbroken.  The soldier runs up and shoots it.  Slowly, humbly it sinks\r\nto the ground.\r\n\r\nWe take our hands from our ears.  The cries are silenced.  Only a\r\nlong-drawn, dying sigh still hangs on the air.\r\n\r\nThen again only the rockets, the singing of the shells, and the\r\nstars--and they shine out wonderfully.\r\n\r\nDetering walks up and down cursing: \"Like to know what harm they've\r\ndone.\"  He returns to it once again.  His voice is agitated, it\r\nsounds almost dignified as he says: \"I tell you it is the vilest\r\nbaseness to use horses in the war.\"\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nWe go back.  It is time we returned to the lorries.  The sky is\r\nbecome a bit brighter.  Three o'clock in the morning.  The breeze is\r\nfresh and cool, the pale hour makes our faces look grey.\r\n\r\nWe trudge onward in single file through the trenches and shell-holes\r\nand come again to the zone of mist.  Katczinsky is restive, that's a\r\nbad sign.\r\n\r\n\"What's up, Kat?\" says Kropp.\r\n\r\n\"I wish I were back home.\"  Home--he means the huts.\r\n\r\n\"It won't last much longer, Kat.\"\r\n\r\nHe is nervous.  \"I don't know, I don't know----\"\r\n\r\nWe come to the communication-trench and then to the open fields.  The\r\nlittle wood reappears; we know every foot of ground here.  There's\r\nthe cemetery with the mounds and the black crosses.\r\n\r\nThat moment it breaks out behind us, swells, roars, and thunders.  We\r\nduck down--a cloud of flame shoots up a hundred yards ahead of us.\r\n\r\nThe next minute under a second explosion part of the wood rises\r\nslowly in the air, three or four trees sail up and then crash to\r\npieces.  The shells begin to hiss like safety-valves--heavy fire----\r\n\r\n\"Take cover!\" yells somebody--\"Cover!\"\r\n\r\nThe fields are flat, the wood is too distant and dangerous--the only\r\ncover is the graveyard and the mounds.  We stumble across in the dark\r\nand as though spirited away every man lies glued behind a mound.\r\n\r\nNot a moment too soon.  The dark goes mad.  It heaves and raves.\r\nDarknesses blacker than the night rush on us with giant strides, over\r\nus and away.  The flames of the explosions light up the graveyard.\r\n\r\nThere is no escape anywhere.  By the light of the shells I try to get\r\na view of the fields.  They are a surging sea, daggers of flame from\r\nthe explosions leap up like fountains.  It is impossible for anyone\r\nto break through it.\r\n\r\nThe wood vanishes, it is pounded, crushed, torn to pieces.  We must\r\nstay here in the grave-yard.\r\n\r\nThe earth bursts before us.  It rains clods.  I feel a smack.  My\r\nsleeve is torn away by a splinter.  I shut my fist.  No pain.  Still\r\nthat does not reassure me: wounds don't hurt till afterwards.  I feel\r\nthe arm all over.  It is grazed but sound.  Now a crack on the skull,\r\nI begin to lose consciousness.  Like lightning the thought comes to\r\nme: Don't faint, sink down in the black broth and immediately come up\r\nto the top again.  A splinter slashes into my helmet, but has\r\ntravelled so far that it does not go through.  I wipe the mud out of\r\nmy eyes.  A hole is torn up in front of me.  Shells hardly ever land\r\nin the same hole twice, I'll get into it.  With one bound I fling\r\nmyself down and lie on the earth as flat as a fish; there it whistles\r\nagain, quickly I crouch together, claw for cover, feel something on\r\nthe left, shove in beside it, it gives way, I groan, the earth leaps,\r\nthe blast thunders in my ears, I creep under the yielding thing,\r\ncover myself with it, draw it over me, it is wood, cloth, cover,\r\ncover, miserable cover against the whizzing splinters.\r\n\r\nI open my eyes--my fingers grasp a sleeve, an arm.  A wounded man?  I\r\nyell to him--no answer--a dead man.  My hand gropes farther,\r\nsplinters of wood--now I remember again that we are lying in the\r\ngraveyard.\r\n\r\nBut the shelling is stronger than everything.  It wipes out the\r\nsensibilities, I merely crawl still deeper into the coffin, it should\r\nprotect me, and especially as Death himself lies in it too.\r\n\r\nBefore me gapes the shell-hole.  I grasp it with my eyes as with\r\nfists.  With one leap I must be in it.  There, I get a smack in the\r\nface, a hand clamps on to my shoulder--has the dead man waked\r\nup?--The hand shakes me, I turn my head, in the second of light I\r\nstare into the face of Katczinsky, he has his mouth wide open and is\r\nyelling.  I hear nothing, he rattles me, comes nearer, in a momentary\r\nlull his voice reaches me: \"Gas--Gaas--Gaaas--Pass it on.\"\r\n\r\nI grab for my gas-mask.  Some distance from me there lies someone.  I\r\nthink of nothing but this: That fellow there must know:\r\nGaaas--Gaaas----\r\n\r\nI call, I lean toward him, I swipe at him with the satchel, he\r\ndoesn't see--once again, again--he merely ducks--it's a recruit--I\r\nlook at Kat desperately, he has his mask ready--I pull out mine too,\r\nmy helmet falls to one side, it slips over my face, I reach the man,\r\nhis satchel is on the side nearest me, I seize the mask, pull it over\r\nhis head, he understands, I let go and with a jump drop back into the\r\nshell-hole.\r\n\r\nThe dull thud of the gas-shells mingles with the crashes of the high\r\nexplosives.  A bell sounds between the explosions, gongs, and metal\r\nclappers warning everyone--Gas--Gas--Gaas.\r\n\r\nSomeone plumps down behind me, another.  I wipe the goggles of my\r\nmask clear of the moist breath.  It is Kat, Kropp, and someone else.\r\nAll four of us lie there in heavy, watchful suspense and breathe as\r\nlightly as possible.\r\n\r\nThese first minutes with the mask decide between life and death: is\r\nit tightly woven?  I remember the awful sights in the hospital: the\r\ngas patients who in day-long suffocation cough their burnt lungs up\r\nin clots.\r\n\r\nCautiously, the mouth applied to the valve, I breathe.  The gas still\r\ncreeps over the ground and sinks into all hollows.  Like a big, soft\r\njellyfish it floats into our shell-hole and lolls there obscenely.  I\r\nnudge Kat, it is better to crawl out and lie on top than to stay here\r\nwhere the gas collects most.  But we don't get as far as that; a\r\nsecond bombardment begins.  It is no longer as though the shells\r\nroared; it is the earth itself raging.\r\n\r\nWith a crash something black bears down on us.  It lands close beside\r\nus; a coffin thrown up.\r\n\r\nI see Kat move and I crawl across.  The coffin has hit the fourth man\r\nin our hole on his outstretched arm.  He tries to tear off his\r\ngas-mask with the other hand.  Kropp seizes him just in time, twists\r\nthe hand sharply behind his back and holds it fast.\r\n\r\nKat and I proceed to free the wounded arm.  The coffin lid is loose\r\nand bursts open, we are easily able to pull it off, we toss the\r\ncorpse out, it slides down to the bottom of the shell-hole, then we\r\ntry to loosen the under-part.\r\n\r\nFortunately the man swoons and Kropp is able to help us.  We no\r\nlonger have to be careful, but work away till the coffin gives with a\r\nsigh before the spade that we have dug in under it.\r\n\r\nIt has grown lighter.  Kat takes a piece of the lid, places it under\r\nthe shattered arm, and we wrap all our bandages round it.  For the\r\nmoment we can do no more.\r\n\r\nInside the gas-mask my head booms and roars--it is nigh bursting.  My\r\nlungs are tight, they breathe always the same hot, used-up air, the\r\nveins on my temples are swollen, I feel I am suffocating.\r\n\r\nA grey light filters through to us.  I climb out over the edge of the\r\nshell-hole.  In the dirty twilight lies a leg torn clean off; the\r\nboot is quite whole, I take that all in at a glance.  Now someone\r\nstands up a few yards distant.  I polish the windows, in my\r\nexcitement they are immediately dimmed again, I peer through them,\r\nthe man there no longer wears his mask.\r\n\r\nI wait some seconds--he has not collapsed--he looks around and makes\r\na few paces--rattling in my throat I tear my mask off too and fall\r\ndown, the air streams into me like cold water, my eyes are bursting,\r\nthe wave sweeps over me and extinguishes me.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nThe shelling has ceased.  I drag myself to the crater and tell the\r\nothers.  They take off their masks.  We lift up the wounded man, one\r\ntaking his splintered arm.  And so we stumble off hastily.\r\n\r\nThe graveyard is a mass of wreckage.  Coffins and corpses lie strewn\r\nabout.  They have been killed once again; but each of them that was\r\nflung up saved one of us.\r\n\r\nThe hedge is destroyed, the rails of the light railway are torn up\r\nand rise stiffly in the air in great arches.  Someone lies in front\r\nof us.  We stop; Kropp goes on alone with the wounded man.\r\n\r\nThe man on the ground is a recruit.  His hip is covered with blood;\r\nhe is so exhausted that I feel for my water-bottle where I have rum\r\nand tea.  Kat restrains my hand and stoops over him.\r\n\r\n\"Where's it got you, comrade?\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes move.  He is too weak to answer.\r\n\r\nWe cut off his trousers carefully.  He groans.  \"Gently, gently, it\r\nis much better----\"\r\n\r\nIf he has been hit in the stomach he oughtn't to drink anything.\r\nThere's no vomiting, that's a good sign.  We lay the hip bare.  It is\r\none mass of mincemeat and bone splinters.  The joint has been hit.\r\nThis lad won't walk any more.\r\n\r\nI wet his temples with a moistened finger and give him a swig.  His\r\neyes move again.  We see now that the right arm is bleeding as well.\r\n\r\nKat spreads out two wads of dressing as wide as possible so that they\r\nwill cover the wound.  I look for something to bind loosely round it.\r\nWe have nothing more, so I slit up the wounded man's trouser leg\r\nstill farther in order to use a piece of his underpants as a bandage.\r\nBut he is wearing none.  I now look at him closely.  He is the\r\nfair-headed boy of a little while ago.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Kat has taken a bandage from a dead man's pocket and\r\nwe carefully bind the wound.  I say to the youngster who looks at us\r\nfixedly: \"We're going for a stretcher now----\"\r\n\r\nThen he opens his mouth and whispers: \"Stay here----\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll be back again soon,\" says Kat.  \"We are only going to get a\r\nstretcher for you.\"\r\n\r\nWe don't know if he understands.  He whimpers like a child and plucks\r\nat us: \"Don't go away----\"\r\n\r\nKat looks around and whispers: \"Shouldn't we just take a revolver and\r\nput an end to it?\"\r\n\r\nThe youngster will hardly survive the carrying, and at the most he\r\nwill only last a few days.  What he has gone through so far is\r\nnothing to what he's in for till he dies.  Now he is numb and feels\r\nnothing.  In an hour he will become one screaming bundle of\r\nintolerable pain.  Every day that he can live will be a howling\r\ntorture.  And to whom does it matter whether he has them or not----\r\n\r\nI nod.  \"Yes, Kat, we ought to put him out of his misery.\"\r\n\r\nHe stands still a moment.  He has made up his mind.  We look\r\nround--but we are no longer alone.  A little group is gathering, from\r\nthe shell-holes and trenches appear heads.\r\n\r\nWe get a stretcher.\r\n\r\nKat shakes his head.  \"Such a kid----\"  He repeats it: \"Young\r\ninnocents----\"\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nOur losses are less than was to be expected--five killed and eight\r\nwounded.  It was in fact quite a short bombardment.  Two of our dead\r\nlie in the upturned graves.  We had merely to throw the earth in on\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWe go back.  We trot off silently in single file one behind the\r\nother.  The wounded are taken to the dressing-station.  The morning\r\nis cloudy.  The bearers make a fuss about numbers and tickets, the\r\nwounded whimper.  It begins to rain.\r\n\r\nAn hour later we reach our lorries and climb in.  There is more room\r\nnow than there was.\r\n\r\nThe rain becomes heavier.  We take out waterproof sheets and spread\r\nthem over our heads.  The rain rattles down, and flows off at the\r\nsides in streams.  The lorries bump through the holes, and we rock\r\nto and fro in a half-sleep.  Two men in the front of the lorry have\r\nlong forked poles.  They watch for telephone wires which hang\r\ncrosswise over the road so densely that they might easily pull our\r\nheads off.  The two fellows take them at the right moment on their\r\npoles and lift them over behind us.  We hear their call\r\n\"Mind--wire--,\" dip the knee in a half-sleep and straighten up again.\r\n\r\nMonotonously the lorries sway, monotonously come the calls,\r\nmonotonously falls the rain.  It falls on our heads and on the heads\r\nof the dead up in the line, on the body of the little recruit with\r\nthe wound that is so much too big for his hip; it falls on\r\nKemmerich's grave; it falls in our hearts.\r\n\r\nAn explosion sounds somewhere.  We wince, our eyes become tense, our\r\nhands are ready to vault over the side of the lorry into the ditch by\r\nthe road.\r\n\r\nIt goes no farther--only the monotonous cry: \"Mind--wire,\"--our knees\r\nbend--we are again half asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nKilling each separate louse is a tedious business when a man has\r\nhundreds.  The little beasts are hard and the everlasting cracking\r\nwith one's fingernails very soon becomes wearisome.  So Tjaden has\r\nrigged up the lid of a boot-polish tin with a piece of wire over the\r\nlighted stump of a candle.  The lice are simply thrown into this\r\nlittle pan.  Crack! and they're done for.\r\n\r\nWe sit around with our shirts on our knees, our bodies naked to the\r\nwarm air and our hands at work.  Haie has a particularly fine brand\r\nof louse: they have a red cross on their heads.  He suggests that he\r\nbrought them back with him from the hospital at Thourhout, where they\r\nattended personally on a surgeon-general.  He says he means to use\r\nthe fat that slowly accumulates in the tin-lid for polishing his\r\nboots, and roars with laughter for half an hour at his own joke.\r\n\r\nBut he hasn't much success to-day; we are too preoccupied with\r\nanother affair.\r\n\r\nThe rumour has materialized.  Himmelstoss has come.  He appeared\r\nyesterday; we've already heard the well-known voice.  He seems to\r\nhave overdone it with a couple of young recruits on the ploughed\r\nfield at home, and unknown to him the son of the local magistrate was\r\nwatching.  That cooked his goose.\r\n\r\nHe will meet some surprises here.  Tjaden has been meditating for\r\nhours what to say to him.  Haie gazes thoughtfully at his great paws\r\nand winks at me.  The thrashing was the high water mark of his life.\r\nHe tells me he often dreams of it.  Kropp and Müller are amusing\r\nthemselves.  From somewhere or other, probably the\r\npioneer-cook-house, Kropp has bagged for himself a mess-tin full of\r\nbeans.  Müller squints hungrily into it but checks himself and says:\r\n\"Albert, what would you do if it were suddenly peace-time again?\"\r\n\r\n\"There won't be any civil life,\" says Albert bluntly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, but if--\" persists Müller, \"what would you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Clear out of this!\" growls Kropp.\r\n\r\n\"Of course.  And then what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Get drunk,\" says Albert.\r\n\r\n\"Don't talk rot, I mean seriously----\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I,\" says Kropp, \"what else should a man do?\"\r\n\r\nKat becomes interested.  He levies tribute on Kropp's tin of beans,\r\nswallows some, then considers for a while and says: \"You might get\r\ndrunk first, of course, but then you'd take the next train for home\r\nand mother.  Peace-time, man, Albert----\"\r\n\r\nHe fumbles in his oil-cloth pocket-book for a photograph and suddenly\r\nshows it all round.  \"My old people!\"  Then he puts it back and\r\nswears: \"Damned lousy war----\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all very well for you to talk,\" I tell him.  \"You've a wife and\r\nchildren.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" he nods, \"and I have to see to it that they've something to\r\neat.\"\r\n\r\nWe laugh.  \"They won't lack for that, Kat, you'd scrounge it from\r\nsomewhere.\"\r\n\r\nMüller is insatiable and gives himself no peace.  He wakes Haie\r\nWesthus out of his dream.  \"Haie, what would you do if it was peace\r\ntime?\"\r\n\r\n\"Give you a kick in the backside for the way you talk,\" I say.  \"How\r\ndoes it come about exactly?\"\r\n\r\n\"How does the cow-shit come on the roof?\" retorts Müller laconically,\r\nand turns to Haie Westhus again.\r\n\r\nIt is too much for Haie.  He shakes his freckled head:\r\n\r\n\"You mean when the war's over?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.  You've said it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there'd be women of course, eh?\"--Haie licks his lips.\r\n\r\n\"Sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"By Jove yes,\" says Haie, his face melting, \"then I'd grab some good\r\nbuxom dame, some real kitchen wench with plenty to get hold of, you\r\nknow, and jump straight into bed.  Just you think, boys, a real\r\nfeather-bed with a spring mattress; I wouldn't put trousers on again\r\nfor a week.\"\r\n\r\nEveryone is silent.  The picture is too good.  Our flesh creeps.  At\r\nlast Müller pulls himself together and says:\r\n\r\n\"And then what?\"\r\n\r\nA pause.  Then Haie explains rather awkwardly: \"If I were a non-com.\r\nI'd stay with the Prussians and serve out my time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Haie, you've got a screw loose, surely!\" I say.\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever dug peat?\" he retorts good-naturedly.  \"You try it.\"\r\n\r\nThen he pulls a spoon out of the top of his boot and reaches over\r\ninto Kropp's mess-tin.\r\n\r\n\"It can't be worse than digging trenches,\" I venture.\r\n\r\nHaie chews and grins: \"It lasts longer though.  And there's no\r\ngetting out of it either.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, man, surely it's better at home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some ways,\" says he, and with open mouth sinks into a day-dream.\r\n\r\nYou can see what he is thinking.  There is the mean little hut on the\r\nmoors, the hard work on the heath from morning till night in the\r\nheat, the miserable pay, the dirty labourer's clothes.\r\n\r\n\"In the army in peace time you've nothing to trouble about,\" he goes\r\non, \"your food's found every day, or else you kick up a row; you've a\r\nbed, every week clean under-wear like a perfect gent, you do your\r\nnon-com.'s duty, you have a good suit of clothes; in the evening\r\nyou're a free man and go off to the pub.\"\r\n\r\nHaie is extraordinarily set on his idea.  He's in love with it.\r\n\r\n\"And when your twelve years are up you get your pension and become a\r\nvillage bobby, and you can walk about the whole day.\"\r\n\r\nHe's already sweating on it.  \"And just you think how you'd be\r\ntreated.  Here a dram, there a pint.  Everybody wants to be well in\r\nwith a bobby.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll never be a non-com. though, Haie,\" interrupts Kat.\r\n\r\nHaie looks at him sadly and is silent.  His thoughts still linger\r\nover the clear evenings in autumn, the Sundays in the heather, the\r\nvillage bells, the afternoons and evenings with the servant girls,\r\nthe fried bacon and barley, the care-free evening hours in the\r\nale-house----\r\n\r\nHe can't part with all these dreams so abruptly; he merely growls:\r\n\"What silly questions you do ask.\"\r\n\r\nHe pulls his shirt over his head and buttons up his tunic.\r\n\r\n\"What would you do, Tjaden?\" asks Kropp.\r\n\r\nTjaden thinks only of one thing.  \"See to it that Himmelstoss doesn't\r\nget past me.\"\r\n\r\nApparently he would like most to have him in a cage and sail into him\r\nwith a club every morning.  To Kropp he says warmly: \"If I were in\r\nyour place I'd see to it that I became a lieutenant.  Then you could\r\ngrind him till the water in his backside boils.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you, Detering?\" asks Müller like an inquisitor.  He's a born\r\nschoolmaster with all his questions.\r\n\r\nDetering is sparing with his words.  But on this subject he speaks.\r\nHe looks at the sky and says only the one sentence: \"I would go\r\nstraight on with the harvesting.\"\r\n\r\nThen he gets up and walks off.\r\n\r\nHe is worried.  His wife has to look after the farm.  They've already\r\ntaken away two of his horses.  Every day he reads the papers that\r\ncome, to see whether it is raining in his little corner of Oldenburg.\r\nThey haven't brought the hay in yet.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Himmelstoss appears.  He comes straight up to our\r\ngroup.  Tjaden's face turns red.  He stretches his length on the\r\ngrass and shuts his eyes in embarrassment.\r\n\r\nHimmelstoss is a little hesitant, his gait becomes slower.  Then he\r\nmarches up to us.  No one makes any motion to stand up.  Kropp looks\r\nup at him with interest.\r\n\r\nHe continues to stand in front of us and wait.  As no one says\r\nanything he launches a \"Well?\"\r\n\r\nA couple of seconds go by.  Apparently Himmelstoss doesn't quite know\r\nwhat to do.  He would like most to set us all on the run again.  But\r\nhe seems to have learned already that the front line isn't a parade\r\nground.  He tries it on though, and by addressing himself to one\r\ninstead of to all of us hopes to get some response.  Kropp is\r\nnearest, so he favours him.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you here too?\"\r\n\r\nBut Albert's no friend of his.  \"A bit longer than you, I fancy,\" he\r\nretorts.\r\n\r\nThe red moustache twitches: \"You don't recognize me any more, what?\"\r\n\r\nTjaden now opens his eyes.  \"I do though.\"\r\n\r\nHimmelstoss turns to him: \"Tjaden, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\nTjaden lifts his head.  \"And do you know what you are?\"\r\n\r\nHimmelstoss is disconcerted.  \"Since when have we become so familiar?\r\nI don't remember that we ever slept in the gutter together?\"\r\n\r\nHe has no idea what to make of the situation.  He didn't expect this\r\nopen hostility.  But he is on his guard: someone has already dinned\r\nsome rot into him about getting a shot in the back.\r\n\r\nThe question about the gutter makes Tjaden so mad that he becomes\r\nalmost witty: \"No, you slept there by yourself.\"\r\n\r\nHimmelstoss begins to boil.  But Tjaden gets in ahead of him.  He\r\nmust bring off his insult: \"Wouldn't you like to know what you are?\r\nA dirty hound, that's what you are.  I've been wanting to tell you\r\nthat for a long time.\"\r\n\r\nThe satisfaction of months shines in his dull pig's eyes as he spits\r\nout: Dirty hound!\r\n\r\nHimmelstoss lets fly too, now.  \"What's that, you muck-rake, you\r\ndirty peat-stealer?  Stand up there, bring your heels together when\r\nyour superior officer speaks to you.\"\r\n\r\nTjaden winks solemnly.  \"You take a run and jump at yourself,\r\nHimmelstoss.\"\r\n\r\nHimmelstoss is a raging book of army regulations.  The Kaiser\r\ncouldn't be more insulted.  \"Tjaden, I command you, as your superior\r\nofficer: Stand up!\"\r\n\r\n\"Anything else you would like?\" asks Tjaden.\r\n\r\n\"Will you obey my order or not?\"\r\n\r\nTjaden replies, without knowing it, in the well-known classical\r\nphrase.\r\n\r\nAt the same time he ventilates his backside.\r\n\r\n\"I'll have you court-martialled,\" storms Himmelstoss.\r\n\r\nWe watch him disappear in the direction of the Orderly Room.  Haie\r\nand Tjaden burst into a regular peat-digger's bellow.  Haie laughs so\r\nmuch that he dislocates his jaw, and suddenly stands there helpless\r\nwith his mouth wide open.  Albert has to put it back again by giving\r\nit a blow with his fist.\r\n\r\nKat is troubled: \"If he reports you, it'll be pretty serious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think he will?\" asks Tjaden.\r\n\r\n\"Sure to,\" I say.\r\n\r\n\"The least you'll get will be five days close arrest,\" says Kat.\r\n\r\nThat doesn't worry Tjaden.  \"Five days clink are five days rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if they send you to the Fortress?\" urges the thoroughgoing\r\nMüller.\r\n\r\n\"Well, for the time being the war will be over so far as I am\r\nconcerned.\"\r\n\r\nTjaden is a cheerful soul.  There aren't any worries for him.  He\r\ngoes off with Haie and Leer so that they won't find him in the first\r\nflush of the excitement.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nMüller hasn't finished yet.  He tackles Kropp again.\r\n\r\n\"Albert, if you were really at home now, what would you do?\"\r\n\r\nKropp is contented now and more accommodating:\r\n\r\n\"How many of us were there in the class exactly?\"\r\n\r\nWe count up: out of twenty, seven are dead, four wounded, one in a\r\nmad-house.  That makes twelve privates.\r\n\r\n\"Three of them are lieutenants,\" says Müller.  \"Do you think they\r\nwould still let Kantorek sit on them?\"\r\n\r\nWe guess not: we wouldn't let ourselves be sat on for that matter.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by the three-fold theme in 'William Tell'?\" says\r\nKropp reminiscently, and roars with laughter.\r\n\r\n\"What was the purpose of the Poetic League of Göttingen?\" asks Müller\r\nsuddenly and earnestly.\r\n\r\n\"How many children had Charles the Bald?\" I interrupt gently.\r\n\r\n\"You'll never make anything of your life, Bäumer,\" croaks Müller.\r\n\r\n\"When was the Battle of Zana?\" Kropp wants to know.\r\n\r\n\"You lack the studious mind, Kropp, sit down, three minus----\" I wink.\r\n\r\n\"What offices did Lycurgus consider the most important for the\r\nstate?\" asks Müller, pretending to take off his pince-nez.\r\n\r\n\"Does it go: 'We Germans fear God and none else in the whole world,'\r\nor 'We, the Germans, fear God and----'\" I submit.\r\n\r\n\"How many inhabitants has Melbourne?\" asks Müller.\r\n\r\n\"How do you expect to succeed in life if you don't know that?\" I ask\r\nAlbert hotly.\r\n\r\nWhich he caps with: \"What is meant by Cohesion?\"\r\n\r\nWe remember mighty little of all that rubbish.  Anyway, it has never\r\nbeen the slightest use to us.  At school nobody ever taught us how to\r\nlight a cigarette in a storm of rain, nor how a fire could be made\r\nwith wet wood--nor that it is best to stick a bayonet in the belly\r\nbecause there it doesn't get jammed, as it does in the ribs.\r\n\r\nMüller says thoughtfully: \"What's the use.  We'll have to go back and\r\nsit on the forms again.\"\r\n\r\nI consider that out of the question.  \"We might take a special exam.\"\r\n\r\n\"That needs preparation.  And if you do get through, what then?  A\r\nstudent's life isn't any better.  If you have no money, you have to\r\nwork like the devil.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a bit better.  But it's rot all the same, everything they teach\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nKropp supports me: \"How can a man take all that stuff seriously when\r\nhe's once been out here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Still you must have an occupation of some sort,\" insists Müller, as\r\nthough he were Kantorek himself.\r\n\r\nAlbert cleans his nails with a knife.  We are surprised at this\r\ndelicacy.  But it is merely pensiveness.  He puts the knife away and\r\ncontinues: \"That's just it.  Kat and Detering and Haie will go back\r\nto their jobs because they had them already.  Himmelstoss too.  But\r\nwe never had any.  How will we ever get used to one after this,\r\nhere?\"--he makes a gesture toward the front.\r\n\r\n\"We'll want a private income, and then we'll be able to live by\r\nourselves in a wood,\" I say, but at once feel ashamed of this absurd\r\nidea.\r\n\r\n\"But what will really happen when we go back?\" wonders Müller, and\r\neven he is troubled.\r\n\r\nKropp gives a shrug.  \"I don't know.  Let's get back first, then\r\nwe'll find out.\"\r\n\r\nWe are all utterly at a loss.  \"What could we do?\" I ask.\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to do anything,\" replies Kropp wearily.  \"You'll be\r\ndead one day, so what does it matter?  I don't think we'll ever go\r\nback.\"\r\n\r\n\"When I think about it, Albert,\" I say after a while, rolling over on\r\nmy back, \"when I hear the word 'peace time,' it goes to my head; and\r\nif it really came, I think I would do some unimaginable\r\nthing--something, you know, that it's worth having lain here in the\r\nmuck for.  But I can't even imagine anything.  All I do know is that\r\nthis business about professions and studies and salaries and so\r\non--it makes me sick, it is and always was disgusting.  I don't see\r\nanything--I don't see anything at all, Albert.\"\r\n\r\nAll at once everything seems to me confused and hopeless.\r\n\r\nKropp feels it too.  \"It will go pretty hard with us all.  But nobody\r\nat home seems to worry much about it.  Two years of shells and\r\nbombs--a man won't peel that off as easy as a sock.\"\r\n\r\nWe agree that it's the same for everyone; not only for us here, but\r\neverywhere, for everyone who is of our age; to some more, and to\r\nothers less.  It is the common fate of our generation.\r\n\r\nAlbert expresses it: \"The war has ruined us for everything.\"\r\n\r\nHe is right.  We are not youth any longer.  We don't want to take the\r\nworld by storm.  We are fleeing.  We fly from ourselves.  From our\r\nlife.  We were eighteen and had begun to love life and the world; and\r\nwe had to shoot it to pieces.  The first bomb, the first explosion,\r\nburst in our hearts.  We are cut off from activity, from striving,\r\nfrom progress.  We believe in such things no longer, we believe in\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nThe Orderly Room shows signs of life.  Himmelstoss seems to have\r\nstirred them up.  At the head of the column trots the fat\r\nsergeant-major.  It is queer that almost all pay-sergeant-majors are\r\nfat.\r\n\r\nHimmelstoss follows him, thirsting for vengeance.  His boots gleam in\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\nWe get up.\r\n\r\n\"Where's Tjaden?\" the sergeant puffs.\r\n\r\nNo one knows, of course.  Himmelstoss glowers at us wrathfully.  \"You\r\nknow very well.  You won't say, that's the fact of the matter.  Out\r\nwith it!\"\r\n\r\nFatty looks round enquiringly; but Tjaden is not to be seen.  He\r\ntries another way.\r\n\r\n\"Tjaden will report at the Orderly Room in ten minutes.\"\r\n\r\nThen he steams off with Himmelstoss in his wake.\r\n\r\n\"I have a feeling that next time we go up wiring I'll be letting a\r\nbundle of wire fall on Himmelstoss's leg,\" hints Kropp.\r\n\r\n\"We'll have quite a lot of jokes with him,\" laughs Müller.--\r\n\r\nThat is our sole ambition: to knock the conceit out of a postman.--\r\n\r\nI go into the hut and put Tjaden wise.  He disappears.\r\n\r\nThen we change our possy and lie down again to play cards.  We know\r\nhow to do that: to play cards, to swear, and to fight.  Not much for\r\ntwenty years;--and yet too much for twenty years.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later Himmelstoss is back again.  Nobody pays any\r\nattention to him.  He asks for Tjaden.  We shrug our shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Then you'd better find him,\" he persists.  \"Haven't you been to look\r\nfor him?\"\r\n\r\nKropp lies back in the grass and says: \"Have you ever been out here\r\nbefore?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's none of your business,\" retorts Himmelstoss.  \"I expect an\r\nanswer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good,\" says Kropp, getting up.  \"See up there where those\r\nlittle white clouds are.  Those are anti-aircraft.  We were over\r\nthere yesterday.  Five dead and eight wounded.  It was a lot of fun.\r\nNext time, when you go up with us, before they die the fellows will\r\ncome up to you, click their heels, and ask stiffly: 'Please may I go?\r\nPlease may I hop it?  We've been waiting here a long time for someone\r\nlike you.'\"\r\n\r\nHe sits down again and Himmelstoss disappears like a comet.\r\n\r\n\"Three days C.B.,\" Kat conjectures.\r\n\r\n\"Next time I'll let fly,\" I say to Albert.\r\n\r\nBut that is the end.  The case comes up for trial in the evening.  In\r\nthe Orderly Room sits our Lieutenant, Bertink, and calls us in one\r\nafter another.\r\n\r\nI have to appear as a witness and explain the reason of Tjaden's\r\ninsubordination.\r\n\r\nThe story of the bed-wetting makes an impression.  Himmelstoss is\r\nrecalled and I repeat my statement.\r\n\r\n\"Is that right?\" Bertink asks Himmelstoss.\r\n\r\nHe tries to evade the question, but in the end has to confess, for\r\nKropp tells the same story.\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't someone report the matter, then?\" asks Bertink.\r\n\r\nWe are silent: he must know himself how much use it is reporting such\r\nthings in the army.  It isn't usual to make complaints in the army.\r\nHe understands it all right though, and lectures Himmelstoss, making\r\nit plain to him that the front isn't a parade-ground.  Then comes\r\nTjaden's turn, who gets a long sermon and three days open arrest.  He\r\ngives Kropp a wink and one day's open arrest.  \"It can't be helped,\"\r\nhe says to him regretfully.  He is a decent fellow.\r\n\r\nOpen arrest is quite pleasant.  The clink was once a fowl-house;\r\nthere we can visit the prisoners, we know how to manage it.  Close\r\narrest would have meant the cellar.\r\n\r\nThey used to tie us to a tree, but that is forbidden now.  In many\r\nways we are treated quite like men.\r\n\r\nAn hour after Tjaden and Kropp are settled in behind their\r\nwire-netting we make our way in to them.  Tjaden greets us crowing.\r\nThen we play skat far into the night.  Tjaden wins of course, the\r\nlucky wretch.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nWhen we break up Kat says to me: \"What do you say to some roast\r\ngoose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not bad,\" I agree.\r\n\r\nWe climb up on a munition-waggon.  The ride costs us two cigarettes.\r\nKat has marked the spot exactly.  The shed belongs to a regimental\r\nheadquarters.  I agree to get the goose and receive my instructions.\r\nThe out-house is behind the wall and the door shuts with just a peg.\r\n\r\nKat hoists me up.  I rest my foot in his hands and climb over the\r\nwall.  Kat keeps watch below.\r\n\r\nI wait a few moments to accustom my eyes to the darkness.  Then I\r\nrecognize the shed.  Softly I steal across, lift the peg, pull it out\r\nand open the door.\r\n\r\nI distinguish two white patches.  Two geese, that's bad: if I grab\r\none the other will cackle.  Well, both of them--if I'm quick, it can\r\nbe done.\r\n\r\nI make a jump.  I catch hold of one and the next instant the second.\r\nLike a madman I bash their heads against the wall to stun them.  But\r\nI haven't quite enough weight.  The beasts cackle and strike out with\r\ntheir feet and wings.  I fight desperately, but Lord! what a kick a\r\ngoose has!  They struggle and I stagger about.  In the dark these\r\nwhite patches are terrifying.  My arms have grown wings and I'm\r\nalmost afraid of going up into the sky, as though I held a couple of\r\ncaptive balloons in my fists.\r\n\r\nThen the row begins; one of them gets his breath and goes off like an\r\nalarm clock.  Before I can do anything, something comes in from\r\noutside; I feel a blow, lie outstretched on the floor, and hear awful\r\ngrowls.  A dog.  I steal a glance to the side, he makes a snap at my\r\nthroat.  I lie still and tuck my chin into my collar.\r\n\r\nIt's a bull dog.  After an eternity he withdraws his head and sits\r\ndown beside me.  But if I make the least movement he growls.  I\r\nconsider.  The only thing to do is to get hold of my small revolver,\r\nand that too before anyone arrives.  Inch by inch I move my hand\r\ntoward it.\r\n\r\nI have the feeling that it lasts an hour.  The slightest movement and\r\nthen an awful growl; I lie still, then try again.  When at last I\r\nhave the revolver my hand starts to tremble.  I press it against the\r\nground and then say over to myself: Jerk the revolver up, fire before\r\nhe has a chance to grab, and then jump up.\r\n\r\nSlowly I take a deep breath and become calmer.  Then I hold my\r\nbreath, whip up the revolver, it cracks, the dog leaps howling to one\r\nside, I make for the door of the shed and fall head over heels over\r\none of the damned geese.\r\n\r\nAt full speed I seize it again, and with a swing toss it over the\r\nwall and clamber up.  No sooner am I on top than the dog is up again\r\nas lively as ever and springs at me.  Quickly I let myself drop.  Ten\r\npaces away stands Kat with the goose under his arm.  As soon as he\r\nsees me we run.\r\n\r\nAt last we can take a breather.  The goose is dead, Kat saw to that\r\nin a moment.  We intend to roast it, without telling anybody.  I\r\nfetch a stove and wood from the hut and we crawl into a small\r\ndeserted lean-to which we use for such purposes.  The single window\r\nspace is heavily curtained.  There is a sort of hearth, an iron plate\r\nset on some bricks.  We kindle a fire.\r\n\r\nKat plucks and cleans the goose.  We put the feathers carefully to\r\none side.  We intend to make two cushions out of them with the\r\ninscription: \"Sleep soft under shell fire.\"  The sound of the\r\ngun-fire from the front penetrates into our refuge.  The glow of the\r\nfire lights up our faces, shadows dance on the wall.  Sometimes a\r\nheavy crash and the hut shivers.  Aeroplane bombs.  Once we hear a\r\nstifled cry.  A hut must have been hit.\r\n\r\nAeroplanes drone; the tack-tack of machine guns breaks out.  But no\r\nlight that could be observed shows from us.\r\n\r\nWe sit opposite one another, Kat and I, two soldiers in shabby coats,\r\ncooking a goose in the middle of the night.  We don't talk much, but\r\nI believe we have a more complete communion with one another than\r\neven lovers have.\r\n\r\nWe are two men, two minute sparks of life; outside is the night and\r\nthe circle of death.  We sit on the edge of it crouching in danger,\r\nthe grease drips from our hands, in our hearts we are close to one\r\nanother, and the hour is like the room: flecked over with the lights\r\nand shadows of our feelings cast by a quiet fire.  What does he know\r\nof me or I of him? formerly we should not have had a single thought\r\nin common--now we sit with a goose between us and feel in unison, and\r\nare so intimate that we do not even speak.\r\n\r\nIt takes a long time to roast a goose, even when it is young and fat.\r\nSo we take turns.  One bastes it while the other lies down and\r\nsleeps.  A grand smell gradually fills the hut.\r\n\r\nThe noises without increase in volume, pass into my dream and yet\r\nlinger in my memory.  In a half sleep I watch Kat dip and raise the\r\nladle.  I love him, his shoulders, his angular, stooping figure--and\r\nat the same time I see behind him woods and stars, and a clear voice\r\nutters words that bring me peace, to me, a soldier in big boots,\r\nbelt, and knapsack, taking the road that lies before him under the\r\nhigh heaven, quickly forgetting and seldom sorrowful, for ever\r\npressing on under the wide night sky.\r\n\r\nA little soldier and a clear voice, and if anyone were to caress him\r\nhe would hardly understand, this soldier with the big boots and shut\r\nheart, who marches because he is wearing big boots, and has forgotten\r\nall else but marching.  Beyond the sky-line is a country with\r\nflowers, lying so still that he would like to weep.  There are sights\r\nthere that he has not forgotten, because he never possessed\r\nthem--perplexing, yet lost to him.  Are not his twenty summers there?\r\n\r\nIs my face wet, and where am I?  Kat stands before me, his gigantic,\r\nstooping shadow falls upon me like home.  He speaks gently, he smiles\r\nand goes back to the fire.\r\n\r\nThen he says: \"It's done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Kat.\"\r\n\r\nI stir myself.  In the middle of the room shines the brown goose.  We\r\ntake out our collapsible forks and our pocket-knives and each cuts\r\noff a leg.  With it we have army bread dipped in gravy.  We eat\r\nslowly and with gusto.\r\n\r\n\"How does it taste, Kat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good!  And yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good, Kat.\"\r\n\r\nWe are brothers and press on one another the choicest pieces.\r\nAfterwards I smoke a cigarette and Kat a cigar.  There is still a lot\r\nleft.\r\n\r\n\"How would it be, Kat, if we took a bit to Kropp and Tjaden?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" says he.\r\n\r\nWe carve off a portion and wrap it up carefully in newspaper.  The\r\nrest we thought of taking over to the hut.  Kat laughs, and simply\r\nsays: \"Tjaden.\"\r\n\r\nI agree, we will have to take it all.\r\n\r\nSo we go off to the fowl-house to wake them.  But first we pack away\r\nthe feathers.\r\n\r\nKropp and Tjaden take us for magicians.  Then they get busy with\r\ntheir teeth.  Tjaden holds a wing in his mouth with both hands like a\r\nmouth-organ, and gnaws.  He drinks the gravy from the pot and smacks\r\nhis lips:\r\n\r\n\"May I never forget you!\"\r\n\r\nWe go to our hut.  Again there is the lofty sky with the stars and\r\nthe oncoming dawn, and I pass on beneath it, a soldier with big boots\r\nand a full belly, a little soldier in the early morning--but by my\r\nside, stooping and angular, goes Kat, my comrade.\r\n\r\nThe outlines of the huts are upon us in the dawn like a dark, deep\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nThere are rumours of an offensive.  We go up to the front two days\r\nearlier than usual.  On the way we pass a shelled school-house.\r\nStacked up against its longer side is a high double wall of yellow,\r\nunpolished, brand-new coffins.  They still smell of fir, and pine,\r\nand the forest.  There are at least a hundred.\r\n\r\n\"That's a good preparation for the offensive,\" says Müller astonished.\r\n\r\n\"They're for us,\" growls Detering.\r\n\r\n\"Don't talk rot,\" says Kat to him angrily.\r\n\r\n\"You be thankful if you get so much as a coffin,\" grins Tjaden,\r\n\"they'll slip you a water-proof sheet for your old Aunt Sally of a\r\ncarcase.\"\r\n\r\nThe others jest too, unpleasant jests, but what else can a man\r\ndo?--The coffins are really for us.  The organization surpasses\r\nitself in that kind of thing.\r\n\r\nAhead of us everything is simmering.  The first night we try to get\r\nour bearings.  When it is fairly quiet we can hear the transports\r\nbehind the enemy lines rolling ceaselessly until dawn.  Kat says they\r\ndo not go back but are bringing up troops--troops, munitions, and\r\nshells.\r\n\r\nThe English artillery has been strengthened, that we can detect at\r\nonce.  There are at least four more batteries of twenty-fives to the\r\nright of the farm, and behind the poplars they have put in\r\ntrench-mortars.  Besides these they have brought up a number of those\r\nlittle French beasts with instantaneous fuses.\r\n\r\nWe are in low spirits.  After we have been in the dug-outs two hours\r\nour own shells begin to fall in the trench.  This is the third time\r\nin four weeks.  If it were simply a mistake in aim no one would say\r\nanything, but the truth is that the barrels are worn out.  The shots\r\nare often so uncertain that they land within our own lines.  To-night\r\ntwo of our men were wounded by them.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nThe front is a cage in which we must await fearfully whatever may\r\nhappen.  We lie under the network of arching shells and live in a\r\nsuspense of uncertainty.  Over us Chance hovers.  If a shot comes, we\r\ncan duck, that is all; we neither know nor can determine where it\r\nwill fall.\r\n\r\nIt is this Chance that makes us indifferent.  A few months ago I was\r\nsitting in a dug-out playing skat; after a while I stood up and went\r\nto visit some friends in another dug-out.  On my return nothing more\r\nwas to be seen of the first one, it had been blown to pieces by a\r\ndirect hit.  I went back to the second and arrived just in time to\r\nlend a hand digging it out.  In the interval it had been buried.\r\n\r\nIt is just as much a matter of chance that I am still alive as that I\r\nmight have been hit.  In a bomb-proof dug-out I may be smashed to\r\natoms and in the open may survive ten hours' bombardment unscathed.\r\nNo soldier outlives a thousand chances.  But every soldier believes\r\nin Chance and trusts his luck.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nWe must look out for our bread.  The rats have become much more\r\nnumerous lately because the trenches are no longer in good condition.\r\nDetering says it is a sure sign of a coming bombardment.\r\n\r\nThe rats here are particularly repulsive, they are so fat--the kind\r\nwe call corpse-rats.  They have shocking, evil, naked faces, and it\r\nis nauseating to see their long, nude tails.\r\n\r\nThey seem to be mighty hungry.  Almost every man has had his bread\r\ngnawed.  Kropp wrapped his in his waterproof sheet and put it under\r\nhis head, but he cannot sleep because they run over his face to get\r\nat it.  Detering meant to outwit them: he fastened a thin wire to the\r\nroof and suspended his bread from it.  During the night when he\r\nswitched on his pocket-torch he saw the wire swinging to and fro.  On\r\nthe bread was riding a fat rat.\r\n\r\nAt last we put a stop to it.  We cannot afford to throw the bread\r\naway, because already we have practically nothing left to eat in the\r\nmorning, so we carefully cut off the bits of bread that the animals\r\nhave gnawed.\r\n\r\nThe slices we cut off are heaped together in the middle of the floor.\r\nEach man takes out his spade and lies down prepared to strike.\r\nDetering, Kropp, and Kat hold their pocket-lamps ready.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes we hear the first shuffling and tugging.  It\r\ngrows, now it is the sound of many little feet.  Then the torches\r\nswitch on and every man strikes at the heap, which scatters with a\r\nrush.  The result is good.  We toss the bits of rat over the parapet\r\nand again lie in wait.\r\n\r\nSeveral times we repeat the process.  At last the beasts get wise to\r\nit, or perhaps they have scented the blood.  They return no more.\r\nNevertheless, before morning the remainder of the bread on the floor\r\nhas been carried off.\r\n\r\nIn the adjoining sector they attacked two large cats and a dog, bit\r\nthem to death and devoured them.\r\n\r\nNext day there is an issue of Edamer cheese.  Each man gets almost a\r\nquarter of a cheese.  In one way that is all to the good, for Edamer\r\nis tasty--but in another way it is vile, because the fat red balls\r\nhave long been a sign of a bad time coming.  Our forebodings increase\r\nas rum is served out.  We drink it of course; but are not greatly\r\ncomforted.\r\n\r\nFor days we loaf about and make war on the rats.  Ammunition and\r\nhand-grenades become more plentiful.  We even overhaul the\r\nbayonets--that is to say, the ones that have a saw on the blunt edge.\r\nIf the fellows over there catch a man with one of those he's killed\r\nat sight.  In the next sector some of our men were found whose noses\r\nwere cut off and their eyes poked out with their own saw-bayonets.\r\nTheir mouths and noses were stuffed with sawdust so that they\r\nsuffocated.\r\n\r\nSome of the recruits have bayonets of this kind; we take them away\r\nand give them the ordinary kind.\r\n\r\nBut the bayonet has practically lost its importance.  It is usually\r\nthe fashion now to charge with bombs and spades only.  The sharpened\r\nspade is a more handy and many-sided weapon; not only can it be used\r\nfor jabbing a man under the chin, but it is much better for striking\r\nwith because of its greater weight, and if one hits between the neck\r\nand shoulder it easily cleaves as far down as the chest.  The bayonet\r\nfrequently jams on the thrust and then a man has to kick hard on the\r\nother fellow's belly to pull it out again; and in the interval he may\r\neasily get one himself.  And what's more the blade often gets broken\r\noff.\r\n\r\nAt night they send over gas.  We expect the attack to follow and lie\r\nwith our masks on, ready to tear them off as soon as the first shadow\r\nappears.\r\n\r\nDawn approaches without anything happening--only the everlasting,\r\nnerve-wracking roll behind the enemy lines, trains, trains, lorries,\r\nlorries; but what are they concentrating?  Our artillery fires on it\r\ncontinually, but still it does not cease.\r\n\r\nWe have tired faces and avoid each other's eyes.  \"It will be like\r\nthe Somme,\" says Kat gloomily.  \"There we were shelled steadily for\r\nseven days and nights.\"  Kat has lost all his fun since we have been\r\nhere, which is bad, for Kat is an old front-hog, and can smell what\r\nis coming.  Only Tjaden seems pleased with the good rations and the\r\nrum; he thinks we might even go back to rest without anything\r\nhappening at all.\r\n\r\nIt almost looks like it.  Day after day passes.  At night I squat in\r\nthe listening-post.  Above me the rockets and parachute-lights shoot\r\nup and float down again.  I am cautious and tense, my heart thumps.\r\nMy eyes turn again and again to the luminous dial of my watch; the\r\nhands will not budge.  Sleep hangs on my eyelids, I work my toes in\r\nmy boots in order to keep awake.  Nothing happens till I am\r\nrelieved;--only the everlasting rolling over there.  Gradually we\r\ngrow calmer and play skat and poker continually.  Perhaps we will be\r\nlucky.\r\n\r\nAll day the sky is hung with observation balloons.  There is a rumour\r\nthat the enemy are going to put tanks over and use low-flying planes\r\nfor the attack.  But that interests us less than what we hear of the\r\nnew flame-throwers.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nWe wake up in the middle of the night.  The earth booms.  Heavy fire\r\nis falling on us.  We crouch into corners.  We distinguish shells of\r\nevery calibre.\r\n\r\nEach man lays hold of his things and looks again every minute to\r\nreassure himself that they are still there.  The dug-out heaves, the\r\nnight roars and flashes.  We look at each other in the momentary\r\nflashes of light, and with pale faces and pressed lips shake our\r\nheads.\r\n\r\nEvery man is aware of the heavy shells tearing down the parapet,\r\nrooting up the embankment and demolishing the upper layers of\r\nconcrete.  When a shell lands in the trench we note how the hollow,\r\nfurious blast is like a blow from the paw of a raging beast of prey.\r\nAlready by morning a few of the recruits are green and vomiting.\r\nThey are too inexperienced.\r\n\r\nSlowly the grey light trickles into the post and pales the flashes of\r\nthe shells.  Morning is come.  The explosion of mines mingles with\r\nthe gun-fire.  That is the most dementing convulsion of all.  The\r\nwhole region where they go up becomes one grave.\r\n\r\nThe reliefs go out, the observers stagger in, covered with dirt, and\r\ntrembling.  One lies down in silence in the corner and eats, the\r\nother, a reservist-reinforcement, sobs; twice he has been flung over\r\nthe parapet by the blast of the explosions without getting any more\r\nthan shell-shock.\r\n\r\nThe recruits are eyeing him.  We must watch them, these things are\r\ncatching, already some lips begin to quiver.  It is good that it is\r\ngrowing daylight; perhaps the attack will come before noon.\r\n\r\nThe bombardment does not diminish.  It is falling in the rear too.\r\nAs far as one can see it spouts fountains of mud and iron.  A wide\r\nbelt is being raked.\r\n\r\nThe attack does not come, but the bombardment continues.  Slowly we\r\nbecome mute.  Hardly a man speaks.  We cannot make ourselves\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nOur trench is almost gone.  At many places it is only eighteen inches\r\nhigh, it is broken by holes, and craters, and mountains of earth.  A\r\nshell lands square in front of our post.  At once it is dark.  We are\r\nburied and must dig ourselves out.  After an hour the entrance is\r\nclear again, and we are calmer because we have had something to do.\r\n\r\nOur company commander scrambles in and reports that two dug-outs are\r\ngone.  The recruits calm themselves when they see him.  He says that\r\nan attempt will be made to bring up food this evening.\r\n\r\nThat sounds reassuring.  No one had thought of it except Tjaden.  Now\r\nthe outside world seems to draw a little nearer: if food can be\r\nbrought up, think the recruits, then it can't really be so bad.\r\n\r\nWe do not disabuse them; we know that food is as important as\r\nammunition and only for that reason must be brought up.\r\n\r\nBut it miscarries.  A second party goes out, and it also turns back.\r\nFinally Kat tries, and even he reappears without accomplishing\r\nanything.  No one gets through, not even a fly is small enough to get\r\nthrough such a barrage.\r\n\r\nWe pull in our belts tighter and chew every mouthful three times as\r\nlong.  Still the food does not last out; we are damnably hungry.  I\r\ntake out a scrap of bread, eat the white and put the crust back in my\r\nknapsack; from time to time I nibble at it.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nThe night is unbearable.  We cannot sleep, but stare ahead of us and\r\ndoze.  Tjaden regrets that we wasted the gnawed pieces of bread on\r\nthe rats.  We would gladly have them again to eat now.  We are short\r\nof water, too, but not seriously yet.\r\n\r\nTowards morning, while it is still dark, there is some excitement.\r\nThrough the entrance rushes in a swarm of fleeing rats that try to\r\nstorm the walls.  Torches light up the confusion.  Everyone yells and\r\ncurses and slaughters.  The madness and despair of many hours unloads\r\nitself in this outburst.  Faces are distorted, arms strike out, the\r\nbeasts scream; we just stop in time to avoid attacking one another.\r\n\r\nThe onslaught has exhausted us.  We lie down to wait again.  It is a\r\nmarvel that our post has had no casualties so far.  It is one of the\r\nfew deep dug-outs.\r\n\r\nA corporal creeps in; he has a loaf of bread with him.  Three people\r\nhave had the luck to get through during the night and bring some\r\nprovisions.  They say the bombardment extends undiminished as far as\r\nthe artillery lines.  It is a mystery where the enemy gets all his\r\nshells.\r\n\r\nWe wait and wait.  By midday what I expected happens.  One of the\r\nrecruits has a fit.  I have been watching him for a long time,\r\ngrinding his teeth and opening and shutting his fists.  These hunted,\r\nprotruding eyes, we know them too well.  During the last few hours he\r\nhas had merely the appearance of calm.  He had collapsed like a\r\nrotten tree.\r\n\r\nNow he stands up, stealthily creeps across the floor, hesitates a\r\nmoment and then glides towards the door.  I intercept him and say:\r\n\"Where are you going?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be back in a minute,\" says he, and tries to push past me.\r\n\r\n\"Wait a bit, the shelling will stop soon.\"\r\n\r\nHe listens and for a moment his eye becomes clear.  Then again he has\r\nthe glowering eyes of a mad dog, he is silent, he shoves me aside.\r\n\r\n\"One minute, lad,\" I say.  Kat notices.  Just as the recruit shakes\r\nme off Kat jumps in and we hold him.\r\n\r\nThen he begins to rave: \"Leave me alone, let me go out, I will go\r\nout!\"\r\n\r\nHe won't listen to anything and hits out, his mouth is wet and pours\r\nout words, half choked, meaningless words.  It is a case of\r\nclaustrophobia, he feels as though he is suffocating here and wants\r\nto get out at any price.  If we let him go he would run about\r\neverywhere regardless of cover.  He is not the first.\r\n\r\nThough he raves and his eyes roll, it can't be helped, we have to\r\ngive him a hiding to bring him to his senses.  We do it quickly and\r\nmercilessly, and at last he sits down quietly.  The others have\r\nturned pale; let's hope it deters them.  This bombardment is too much\r\nfor the poor devils, they have been sent straight from a\r\nrecruiting-depot into a barrage that is enough to turn an old\r\nsoldier's hair grey.\r\n\r\nAfter this affair the sticky, close atmosphere works more than ever\r\non our nerves.  We sit as if in our graves waiting only to be closed\r\nin.\r\n\r\nSuddenly it howls and flashes terrifically, the dug-out cracks in all\r\nits joints under a direct hit, fortunately only a light one that the\r\nconcrete blocks are able to withstand.  It rings metallically, the\r\nwalls reel, rifles, helmets, earth, mud, and dust fly everywhere.\r\nSulphur fumes pour in.\r\n\r\nIf we were in one of those light dug-outs that they have been\r\nbuilding lately instead of this deep one, not one of us would now be\r\nalive.\r\n\r\nBut the effect is bad enough even so.  The recruit starts to rave\r\nagain and two others follow suit.  One jumps up and rushes out, we\r\nhave trouble with the other two.  I start after the one who escapes\r\nand wonder whether to shoot him in the leg--then it shrieks again, I\r\nfling myself down and when I stand up the wall of the trench is\r\nplastered with smoking splinters, lumps of flesh, and bits of\r\nuniform.  I scramble back.\r\n\r\nThe first recruit seems actually to have gone insane.  He butts his\r\nhead against the wall like a goat.  We must try to-night to take him\r\nto the rear.  Meanwhile we bind him, but in such a way that in case\r\nof attack he can be released at once.\r\n\r\nKat suggests a game of skat: it is easier when a man has something to\r\ndo.  But it is no use, we listen for every explosion that comes\r\nclose, miscount the tricks, and fail to follow suit.  We have to give\r\nit up.  We sit as though in a hissing boiler that is being belaboured\r\nfrom without on all sides.\r\n\r\nNight again.  We are deadened by the strain--a deadly tension that\r\nscrapes along one's spine like a gapped knife.  Our legs refuse to\r\nmove, our hands tremble, our bodies are a thin skin stretched\r\npainfully over repressed madness, over an almost irresistible,\r\nbursting roar.  We have neither flesh nor muscles any longer, we dare\r\nnot look at one another for fear of some incalculable thing.  So we\r\nshut our teeth--it will end--it will end--perhaps we will come\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the nearer explosions cease.  The shelling continues but it\r\nhas lifted and falls behind us, our trench is free.  We seize the\r\nhand-grenades, pitch them out in front of the dug-out and jump after\r\nthem.  The bombardment has stopped and a heavy barrage now falls\r\nbehind us.  The attack has come.\r\n\r\nNo one would believe that in this howling waste there could still be\r\nmen; but steel helmets now appear on all sides out of the trench, and\r\nfifty yards from us a machine-gun is already in position and barking.\r\n\r\nThe wire-entanglements are torn to pieces.  Yet they offer some\r\nobstacle.  We see the storm-troops coming.  Our artillery opens fire.\r\nMachine-guns rattle, rifles crack.  The charge works its way across.\r\nHaie and Kropp begin with the hand-grenades.  They throw as fast as\r\nthey can, others pass them, the handles with the strings already\r\npulled.  Haie throws seventy-five yards, Kropp sixty, it has been\r\nmeasured, the distance is important.  The enemy as they run cannot do\r\nmuch before they are within forty yards.\r\n\r\nWe recognize the distorted faces, the smooth helmets: they are\r\nFrench.  They have already suffered heavily when they reach the\r\nremnants of the barbed wire entanglements.  A whole line has gone\r\ndown before our machine-guns; then we have a lot of stoppages and\r\nthey come nearer.\r\n\r\nI see one of them, his face upturned, fall into a wire cradle.  His\r\nbody collapses, his hands remain suspended as though he were praying.\r\nThen his body drops clean away and only his hands with the stumps of\r\nhis arms, shot off, now hang in the wire.\r\n\r\nThe moment we are about to retreat three faces rise up from the\r\nground in front of us.  Under one of the helmets a dark pointed beard\r\nand two eyes that are fastened on me.  I raise my hand, but I cannot\r\nthrow into those strange eyes; for one mad moment the whole slaughter\r\nwhirls like a circus round me, and these two eyes that are alone\r\nmotionless; then the head rises up, a hand, a movement, and my\r\nhand-grenade flies through the air and into him.\r\n\r\nWe make for the rear, pull wire cradles into the trench and leave\r\nbombs behind us with the string pulled, which ensure us a fiery\r\nretreat.  The machine-guns are already firing from the next position.\r\n\r\nWe have become wild beasts.  We do not fight, we defend ourselves\r\nagainst annihilation.  It is not against men that we fling our bombs,\r\nwhat do we know of men in this moment when Death with hands and\r\nhelmets is hunting us down--now, for the first time in three days we\r\ncan see his face, now, for the first time in three days we can oppose\r\nhim; we feel a mad anger.  No longer do we lie helpless, waiting on\r\nthe scaffold, we can destroy and kill, to save ourselves, to save\r\nourselves and be revenged.\r\n\r\nWe crouch behind every corner, behind every barrier of barbed wire,\r\nand hurl heaps of explosives at the feet of the advancing enemy\r\nbefore we run.  The blast of the hand-grenades impinges powerfully on\r\nour arms and legs; crouching like cats we run on, overwhelmed by this\r\nwave that bears us along, that fills us with ferocity, turning us\r\ninto thugs, into murderers, into God only knows what devils; this\r\nwave that multiplies our strength with fear and madness and greed of\r\nlife, seeking and fighting for nothing but our deliverance.  If your\r\nown father came over with them you would not hesitate to fling a bomb\r\ninto him.\r\n\r\nThe forward trenches have been abandoned.  Are they still trenches?\r\nThey are blown to pieces, annihilated--there are only broken bits of\r\ntrenches, holes linked by tracks; nests of craters, that is all.  But\r\nthe enemy's casualties increase.  They did not count on so much\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nIt is nearly noon.  The sun blazes hotly, the sweat stings in our\r\neyes, we wipe it off on our sleeves and often blood with it.  At last\r\nwe reach a trench that is in a somewhat better condition.  It is\r\nmanned and ready for the counter-attack, it receives us.  Our guns\r\nopen up in full blast and cut off the enemy attack.\r\n\r\nThe lines behind us stop.  They can advance no farther.  The attack\r\nis crushed by our artillery.  We watch.  The fire lifts a hundred\r\nyards and we break forward.  Beside me a lance-corporal has his head\r\ntorn off.  He runs a few steps more while the blood spouts from his\r\nneck like a fountain.\r\n\r\nIt does not come quite to hand-to-hand fighting; they are driven\r\nback.  We arrive once again at our shattered trench and pass on\r\nbeyond it.\r\n\r\nOh, this turning back again!  We reach the shelter of the reserves\r\nand yearn to creep in and disappear;--but instead we must turn round\r\nand plunge again into the horror.  If we were not automata at that\r\nmoment we would continue lying there, exhausted, and without will.\r\nBut we are swept forward again, powerless, madly savage and raging;\r\nwe will kill, for they are still our mortal enemies, their rifles and\r\nbombs are aimed against us, and if we don't destroy them, they will\r\ndestroy us.\r\n\r\nThe brown earth, the torn, blasted earth, with a greasy shine under\r\nthe sun's rays; the earth is the background of this restless, gloomy\r\nworld of automatons, our gasping is the scratching of a quill, our\r\nlips are dry, our heads are debauched with stupor--thus we stagger\r\nforward, and into our pierced and shattered souls bores the torturing\r\nimage of the brown earth with the greasy sun and the convulsed and\r\ndead soldiers, who lie there--it can't be helped--who cry and clutch\r\nat our legs as we spring away over them.\r\n\r\nWe have lost all feeling for one another.  We can hardly control\r\nourselves when our hunted glance lights on the form of some other\r\nman.  We are insensible, dead men, who through some trick, some\r\ndreadful magic, are still able to run and to kill.\r\n\r\nA young Frenchman lags behind, he is overtaken, he puts up his hands,\r\nin one he still holds his revolver--does he mean to shoot or to give\r\nhimself up?--a blow from a spade cleaves through his face.  A second\r\nsees it and tries to run farther; a bayonet jabs into his back.  He\r\nleaps in the air, his arms thrown wide, his mouth wide open, yelling;\r\nhe staggers, in his back the bayonet quivers.  A third throws away\r\nhis rifle, cowers down with his hands before his eyes.  He is left\r\nbehind with a few other prisoners to carry off the wounded.\r\n\r\nSuddenly in the pursuit we reach the enemy line.\r\n\r\nWe are so close on the heels of our retreating enemies that we reach\r\nit almost at the same time as they.  In this way we suffer few\r\ncasualties.  A machine-gun barks, but is silenced with a bomb.\r\nNevertheless, the couple of seconds has sufficed to give us five\r\nstomach wounds.  With the butt of his rifle Kat smashes to pulp the\r\nface of one of the unwounded machine-gunners.  We bayonet the others\r\nbefore they have time to get out their bombs.  Then thirstily we\r\ndrink the water they have for cooling the gun.\r\n\r\nEverywhere wire-cutters are snapping, planks are thrown across the\r\nentanglements, we jump through the narrow entrances into the\r\ntrenches.  Haie strikes his spade into the neck of a gigantic\r\nFrenchman and throws the first hand-grenade; we duck behind a\r\nbreastwork for a few seconds, then the whole section of trench before\r\nus is empty.  The next throw whizzes obliquely over the corner and\r\nclears a passage; as we run past we toss handfuls down into the\r\ndug-outs, the earth shudders, it crashes, dully and stifled, we\r\nstumble over slippery lumps of flesh, over yielding bodies; I fall\r\ninto an open belly on which lies a clean, new officer's cap.\r\n\r\nThe fight ceases.  We lose touch with the enemy.  We cannot stay here\r\nlong but must retire under cover of our artillery to our own\r\nposition.  No sooner do we know this than we dive into the nearest\r\ndug-outs, and with the utmost haste seize on whatever provisions we\r\ncan see, especially the tins of corned beef and butter, before we\r\nclear out.\r\n\r\nWe get back pretty well.  There has been no further attack by the\r\nenemy.  We lie for an hour panting and resting before anyone speaks.\r\nWe are so completely played out that in spite of our great hunger we\r\ndo not think of the provisions.  Then gradually we become something\r\nlike men again.\r\n\r\nThe corned beef over there is famous along the whole front.\r\nOccasionally it has been the chief reason for a flying raid on our\r\npart, for our nourishment is generally very bad; we have a constant\r\nhunger.\r\n\r\nWe bagged five tins altogether.  The fellows over there are well\r\nlooked after; it seems a luxury to us with our hunger-pangs, our\r\nturnip jam, and meat so scarce that we simply grab at it.  Haie has\r\nscored a thin loaf of white French bread, and stuck it in behind his\r\nbelt like a spade.  It is a bit bloody at one corner, but that can be\r\ncut off.\r\n\r\nIt is a good thing we have something decent to eat at last; we still\r\nhave a use for all our strength.  Enough to eat is just as valuable\r\nas a good dug-out; it can save our lives; that is the reason we are\r\nso greedy for it.\r\n\r\nTjaden has captured two water-bottles full of cognac.  We pass them\r\nround.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nThe evening benediction begins.  Night comes, out of the craters rise\r\nthe mists.  It looks as though the holes were full of ghostly\r\nsecrets.  The white vapour creeps painfully round before it ventures\r\nto steal away over the edge.  Then long streaks stretch from crater\r\nto crater.\r\n\r\nIt is chilly.  I am on sentry and stare into the darkness.  My\r\nstrength is exhausted as always after an attack, and so it is hard\r\nfor me to be alone with my thoughts.  They are not properly thoughts;\r\nthey are memories which in my weakness turn homeward and strangely\r\nmove me.\r\n\r\nThe parachute-lights shoot upwards--and I see a picture, a summer\r\nevening, I am in the cathedral cloister and look at the tall rose\r\ntrees that bloom in the middle of the little cloister garden where\r\nthe monks lie buried.  Around the walls are the stone carvings of the\r\nStations of the Cross.  No one is there.  A great quietness rules in\r\nthis blossoming quadrangle, the sun lies warm on the heavy grey\r\nstones, I place my hand upon them and feel the warmth.  At the\r\nright-hand corner the green cathedral spire ascends into the pale\r\nblue sky of the evening.  Between the glowing columns of the cloister\r\nis the cool darkness that only churches have, and I stand there and\r\nwonder whether, when I am twenty, I shall have experienced the\r\nbewildering emotions of love.\r\n\r\nThe image is alarmingly near; it touches me before it dissolves in\r\nthe light of the next star-shell.\r\n\r\nI lay hold of my rifle to see that it is in trim.  The barrel is wet,\r\nI take it in my hand and rub off the moisture with my fingers.\r\n\r\nBetween the meadows behind our town there stands a line of old\r\npoplars by a stream.  They were visible from a great distance, and\r\nalthough they grew on one bank only, we called them the poplar\r\navenue.  Even as children we had a great love for them, they drew us\r\nvaguely thither, we played truant the whole day by them and listened\r\nto their rustling.  We sat beneath them on the bank of the stream and\r\nlet our feet hang over in the bright, swift waters.  The pure\r\nfragrance of the water and the melody of the wind in the poplars held\r\nour fancies.  We loved them dearly, and the image of those days still\r\nmakes my heart pause in its beating.\r\n\r\nIt is strange that all the memories that come have these two\r\nqualities.  They are always completely calm, that is predominant in\r\nthem; and even if they are not really calm, they become so.  They are\r\nsoundless apparitions that speak to me, with looks and gestures,\r\nsilently, without any word--and it is the alarm of their silence that\r\nforces me to lay hold of my sleeve and my rifle lest I should abandon\r\nmyself to the liberation and allurement in which my body would dilate\r\nand gently pass away into the still forces that lie behind these\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nThey are quiet in this way, because quietness is so unattainable for\r\nus now.  At the front there is no quietness and the curse of the\r\nfront reaches so far that we never pass beyond it.  Even in the\r\nremote depots and rest-areas the droning and the muffled noise of\r\nshelling is always in our ears.  We are never so far off that it is\r\nno more to be heard.  But these last few days it has been unbearable.\r\n\r\nTheir stillness is the reason why these memories of former times do\r\nnot awaken desire so much as sorrow--a strange, inapprehensible\r\nmelancholy.  Once we had such desires--but they return not.  They are\r\npast, they belong to another world that is gone from us.  In the\r\nbarracks they called forth a rebellious, wild craving for their\r\nreturn; for then they were still bound to us, we belonged to them and\r\nthey to us, even though we were already absent from them.  They\r\nappeared in the soldiers' songs which we sang as we marched between\r\nthe glow of the dawn and the black silhouettes of the forests to\r\ndrill on the moor, they were a powerful remembrance that was in us\r\nand came from us.\r\n\r\nBut here in the trenches they are completely lost to us.  They arise\r\nno more; we are dead and they stand remote on the horizon, they are\r\nan apparition, a mysterious reflection drawing us home, that we fear\r\nand love without hope.  They are strong and our desire is strong--but\r\nthey are unattainable, and we know it.\r\n\r\nAnd even if these scenes of our youth were given back to us we would\r\nhardly know what to do.  The tender, secret influence that passed\r\nfrom them into us could not arise again.  We long to be in them and\r\nto move in them; we long to remember and to love them and to be\r\nstirred by the sight of them.  But it would be like gazing at the\r\nphotograph of a dead comrade; those are his features, it is his face,\r\nand the days we spent together take on a mournful life in the memory;\r\nbut the man himself it is not.\r\n\r\nWe could never again, as the same beings, take part in those scenes.\r\nIt was not any recognition of their beauty and their significance\r\nthat attracted us, but the communion, the feeling of a comradeship\r\nwith the things and events of our existence, which cut us off and\r\nmade the world of our parents a thing incomprehensible to us--for\r\nthen we surrendered ourselves to events and were lost in them, and\r\nthe least little thing was enough to carry us down the stream of\r\neternity.  Perhaps it was only the privilege of our youth, but as yet\r\nwe recognized no limits and saw nowhere an end.  We had that thrill\r\nof expectation in the blood which united us with the course of our\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nTo-day we would pass through the scenes of our youth like travellers.\r\nWe are burnt up by hard facts; like tradesmen we understand\r\ndistinctions, and like butchers, necessities.  We are no longer\r\nuntroubled--we are indifferent.  We long to be there; but could we\r\nlive there?\r\n\r\nWe are forlorn like children, and experienced like old men, we are\r\ncrude and sorrowful and superficial--I believe we are lost.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nMy hands grow cold and my flesh creeps; and yet the night is warm.\r\nOnly the mist is cold, this mysterious mist that trails the dead\r\nbefore us and sucks from them their last, creeping life.  By morning\r\nthey will be pale and green and their blood congealed and black.\r\n\r\nStill the parachute-rockets shoot up and cast their pitiless light\r\nover the stony landscape, which is full of craters and frozen lights\r\nlike a moon.  The blood beneath my skin brings fear and restlessness\r\ninto my thoughts.  They become feeble and tremble, they desire warmth\r\nand life.  They cannot endure without sympathy and communion, they\r\nare disordered before the naked picture of despair.\r\n\r\nI hear the rattle of the mess-tins and immediately feel a strong\r\ndesire for warm food; it would do me good and comfort me.  Painfully\r\nI force myself to wait until I am relieved.\r\n\r\nThen I go into the dug-out and find a mug of barley.  It is cooked in\r\nfat and tastes good, I eat it slowly.  I remain quiet, though the\r\nothers are in a better mood, for the shelling has died down.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nThe days go by and the incredible hours follow one another as a\r\nmatter of course.  Attacks alternate with counter-attacks and slowly\r\nthe dead pile up in the field of craters between the trenches.  We\r\nare able to bring in most of the wounded that do not lie too far off.\r\nBut many have long to wait and we listen to them dying.\r\n\r\nFor one of them we search two days in vain.  He must be lying on his\r\nbelly and unable to turn over.  Otherwise it is hard to understand\r\nwhy we cannot find him; for it is only when a man has his mouth close\r\nto the ground that it is impossible to gauge the direction of his cry.\r\n\r\nHe must have been badly hit--one of those nasty wounds, neither so\r\nsevere that they exhaust the body at once and a man dreams on in a\r\nhalf-swoon, nor so light that a man endures the pain in the hope of\r\nbecoming well again.  Kat thinks he has either a broken pelvis or a\r\nshot through the spine.  His chest cannot have been injured otherwise\r\nhe would not have such strength to cry out.  And if it were any other\r\nkind of wound it would be possible to see him moving.\r\n\r\nHe grows gradually hoarser.  The voice sounds so desperate that it\r\nprevails everywhere.  The first night some of our fellows go out\r\nthree times to look for him.  But when they think they have located\r\nhim and crawl across, next time they hear the voice it seems to come\r\nfrom somewhere else altogether.\r\n\r\nWe search in vain until dawn.  We scrutinize the field all day with\r\nglasses, but discover nothing.  On the second day the calls are\r\nfainter; that will be because his lips and mouth have become dry.\r\n\r\nOur company commander has promised special leave with three days\r\nextra to anyone who finds him.  That is a powerful inducement, but we\r\nwould do all that is possible without that; for his cry is terrible.\r\nKat and Kropp even go out in the afternoon, and Albert gets the lobe\r\nof his ear shot off in consequence.  It is to no purpose, they come\r\nback without him.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand what he cries.  At first he called only for\r\nhelp--the second night he must have some delirium, he talks with his\r\nwife and his children, we often detect the name Elise.  To-day he\r\nmerely weeps.  By evening the voice dwindles to a croaking.  But it\r\npersists still through the whole night.  We hear it so distinctly\r\nbecause the wind blows toward our line.  In the morning when we\r\nsuppose he must already have long gone to his rest, there comes\r\nacross to us one last gurgling rattle.\r\n\r\nThe days are hot and the dead lie unburied.  We cannot fetch them all\r\nin, if we did we should not know what to do with them.  The shells\r\nwill bury them.  Many have their bellies swollen up like balloons.\r\nThey hiss, belch, and make movements.  The gases in them make noises.\r\n\r\nThe sky is blue and without clouds.  In the evening it grows sultry\r\nand the heat rises from the earth.  When the wind blows toward us it\r\nbrings the smell of blood, which is heavy and sweet.  This deathly\r\nexhalation from the shell holes seems to be a mixture of chloroform\r\nand putrefaction, and fills us with nausea and retching.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nThe nights become quiet and the hunt for copper driving-bands and the\r\nsilken parachutes of the French star-shells begins.  Why the\r\ndriving-bands are so desirable no one knows exactly.  The collectors\r\nmerely assert that they are valuable.  Some have collected so many\r\nthat they will stoop under the weight of them when we go back.\r\n\r\nBut Haie at least gives a reason.  He intends to give them to his\r\ngirl to supplement her garters.  At this the Friesians explode with\r\nmirth.  They slap their knees: \"By Jove though, he's a wit, Haie is,\r\nhe's got brains.\"  Tjaden especially can hardly contain himself; he\r\ntakes the largest of the rings in his hand and every now and then\r\nputs his leg through it to show how much slack there is.\r\n\r\n\"Haie, man, she must have legs like, legs----\" his thoughts mount\r\nsomewhat higher, \"and a behind too she must have, like a--like an\r\nelephant!\"\r\n\r\nHe cannot get over it.  \"I wish I could play hot-hand with her once,\r\nmy hat----\"\r\n\r\nHaie beams, proud that his girl should receive so much appreciation.\r\n\r\n\"She's a nice bit,\" he says with self-satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe parachutes are turned to more practical uses.  According to the\r\nsize of the bust three or perhaps four will make a blouse.  Kropp and\r\nI use them as handkerchiefs.  The others send them home.  If the\r\nwomen could see at what risk these bits of rag are often obtained,\r\nthey would be horrified.\r\n\r\nKat surprises Tjaden endeavouring with perfect equanimity to knock\r\nthe driving-band off a dud.  If anyone else had tried it the thing\r\nwould have exploded, but Tjaden always has his luck with him.\r\n\r\nOne morning two butterflies play in front of our trench.  They are\r\nbrimstone-butterflies, with red spots on their yellow wings.  What\r\ncan they be looking for here?  There is not a plant nor a flower for\r\nmiles.  They settle on the teeth of a skull.  The birds too are just\r\nas carefree, they have long since accustomed themselves to the war.\r\nEvery morning larks ascend from No Man's Land.  A year ago we watched\r\nthem nesting; the young ones grew up too.\r\n\r\nWe have a spell from the rats in the trench.  They are in No Man's\r\nLand--we know what for.  They grow fat; when we see one we have a\r\ncrack at it.  At night we hear again the rolling behind the enemy\r\nlines.  All day we have only the normal shelling, so that we are able\r\nto repair the trenches.  There is always plenty of amusement, the\r\nairmen see to that.  There are countless fights for us to watch every\r\nday.\r\n\r\nBattle planes don't trouble us, but the observation planes we hate\r\nlike the plague; they put the artillery on to us.  A couple of\r\nminutes after they appear, shrapnel and high-explosives begin to drop\r\non us.  We lose eleven men in one day that way, and five of them\r\nstretcher-bearers.  Two are so smashed that Tjaden remarks you could\r\nscrape them off the wall of the trench with a spoon and bury them in\r\na mess-tin.  Another has the lower part of his body and his legs torn\r\noff.  Dead, his chest leans against the side of the trench, his face\r\nis lemon-yellow, in his beard stills burns a cigarette.  It glows\r\nuntil it dies out on his lips.\r\n\r\nWe put the dead in a large shell-hole.  So far there are three\r\nlayers, one on top of the other.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nSuddenly the shelling begins to pound again.  Soon we are sitting up\r\nonce more with the rigid tenseness of blank anticipation.\r\n\r\nAttack, counter-attack, charge, repulse--these are words, but what\r\nthings they signify!  We have lost a good many men, mostly recruits.\r\nReinforcements have again been sent up to our sector.  It is one of\r\nthe new regiments, composed of young fellows called up during last\r\nyear.  They have had hardly any training, and are sent into the field\r\nwith only a theoretical knowledge.  They do know what a hand-grenade\r\nis, it is true, but they have very little idea of cover, and what is\r\nmost important of all, have no eye for it.  A fold in the ground has\r\nto be quite eighteen inches high before they can see it.\r\n\r\nAlthough we need reinforcement, the recruits give us almost more\r\ntrouble than they are worth.  They are helpless in this grim fighting\r\narea, they fall like flies.  The present method of fighting from\r\nposts demands knowledge and experience; a man must have a feeling for\r\nthe contours of the ground, an ear for the sound and character of the\r\nshells, must be able to decide beforehand where they will drop, how\r\nthey will burst, and how to shelter from them.\r\n\r\nThe young recruits of course know none of these things.  They get\r\nkilled simply because they can hardly tell shrapnel from\r\nhigh-explosive, they are mown down because they are listening\r\nanxiously to the roar of the big coal-boxes falling far in the rear,\r\nand miss the light, piping whistle of the low spreading little\r\ndaisy-cutters.  They flock together like sheep instead of scattering,\r\nand even the wounded are shot down like hares by the airmen.\r\n\r\nTheir pale turnip faces, their pitiful clenched hands, the miserable\r\ncourage of these poor devils, the desperate charges and attacks made\r\nby these poor brave devils, who are so terrified that they dare not\r\ncry out loudly, but with battered chests and torn bellies and arms\r\nand legs only whimper softly for their mothers and cease as soon as\r\none looks at them.\r\n\r\nTheir sharp, downy, dead faces have the awful expressionlessness of\r\ndead children.\r\n\r\nIt brings a lump into the throat to see how they go over, and run and\r\nfall.  A man would like to spank them, they are so stupid, and to\r\ntake them by the arm and lead them away from here where they have no\r\nbusiness to be.  They wear grey coats and trousers and boots, but for\r\nmost of them the uniform is far too big, it hangs on their limbs,\r\ntheir shoulders are too narrow, their bodies too slight; no uniform\r\nwas ever made to these childish measurements.\r\n\r\nBetween five and ten recruits fall to every old hand.\r\n\r\nA surprise gas-attack carries off a lot of them.  They have not yet\r\nlearned what to do.  We found one dug-out full of them, with blue\r\nheads and black lips.  Some of them in a shell hole took their masks\r\noff too soon; they did not know that the gas lies longest in the\r\nhollows; when they saw others on top without masks they pulled theirs\r\noff too and swallowed enough to scorch their lungs.  Their condition\r\nis hopeless, they choke to death with hæmorrhages and suffocation.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nIn one part of the trench I suddenly run into Himmelstoss.  We dive\r\ninto the same dug-out.  Breathless we are all lying one beside the\r\nother waiting for the charge.\r\n\r\nWhen we run out again, although I am very excited, I suddenly think:\r\n\"Where's Himmelstoss?\"  Quickly I jump back into the dug-out and find\r\nhim with a small scratch lying in a corner pretending to be wounded.\r\nHis face looks sullen.  He is in a panic; he is new to it too.  But\r\nit makes me mad that the young recruits should be out there and he\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n\"Get out!\" I spit.\r\n\r\nHe does not stir, his lips quiver, his moustache twitches.\r\n\r\n\"Out!\" I repeat.\r\n\r\nHe draws up his legs, crouches back against the wall, and shows his\r\nteeth like a cur.\r\n\r\nI seize him by the arm and try to pull him up.  He barks.\r\n\r\nThat is too much for me.  I grab him by the neck and shake him like a\r\nsack, his head jerks from side to side.\r\n\r\n\"You lump, will you get out--you hound, you skunk, sneak out of it,\r\nwould you?\"  His eye becomes glassy, I knock his head against the\r\nwall--\"You cow\"--I kick him in the ribs--\"You swine\"--I push him\r\ntoward the door and shove him out head first.\r\n\r\nAnother wave of our attack has just come up.  A lieutenant is with\r\nthem.  He sees us and yells; \"Forward, forward, join in, follow.\"\r\nAnd the word of command does what all my banging could not.\r\nHimmelstoss hears the order, looks round him as if awakened, and\r\nfollows on.\r\n\r\nI come after and watch him go over.  Once more he is the smart\r\nHimmelstoss of the parade-ground, he has even outstripped the\r\nlieutenant and is far ahead.\r\n\r\nBombardment, barrage, curtain-fire, mines, gas, tanks, machine-guns,\r\nhand-grenades--words, words, but they hold the horror of the world.\r\n\r\nOur faces are encrusted, our thoughts are devastated, we are weary to\r\ndeath; when the attack comes we shall have to strike many of the men\r\nwith our fists to waken them and make them come with us--our eyes are\r\nburnt, our hands are torn, our knees bleed, our elbows are raw.\r\n\r\nHow long has it been?  Weeks--months--years?  Only days.  We see time\r\npass in the colourless faces of the dying, we cram food into us, we\r\nrun, we throw, we shoot, we kill, we lie about, we are feeble and\r\nspent, and nothing supports us but the knowledge that there are still\r\nfeebler, still more spent, still more helpless ones there who, with\r\nstaring eyes, look upon us as gods that escape death many times.\r\n\r\nIn the few hours of rest we teach them.  \"There, see that waggle-top?\r\nThat's a mortar coming.  Keep down, it will go clean over.  But if it\r\ncomes this way, then run for it.  You can run from a mortar.\"\r\n\r\nWe sharpen their ears to the malicious, hardly audible buzz of the\r\nsmaller shells that are not so easily distinguished.  They must pick\r\nthem out from the general din by their insect-like hum--we explain to\r\nthem that these are far more dangerous than the big ones that can be\r\nheard long beforehand.\r\n\r\nWe show them how to take cover from aircraft, how to simulate a dead\r\nman when one is overrun in an attack, how to time hand-grenades so\r\nthat they explode half a second before hitting the ground; we teach\r\nthem to fling themselves into holes as quick as lightning before the\r\nshells with instantaneous fuses; we show them how to clean up a\r\ntrench with a handful of bombs; we explain the difference between the\r\nfuse-length of the enemy bombs and our own; we put them wise to the\r\nsound of gas shells;--show them all the tricks that can save them\r\nfrom death.\r\n\r\nThey listen, they are docile--but when it begins again, in their\r\nexcitement they do everything wrong.\r\n\r\nHaie Westhus drags off with a great wound in his back through which\r\nthe lung pulses at every breath.  I can only press his hand; \"It's\r\nall up, Paul,\" he groans and bites his arm because of the pain.\r\n\r\nWe see men living with their skulls blown open; we see soldiers run\r\nwith their two feet cut off, they stagger on their splintered stumps\r\ninto the next shell-hole; a lance-corporal crawls a mile and a half\r\non his hands dragging his smashed knee after him; another goes to the\r\ndressing station and over his clasped hands bulge his intestines; we\r\nsee men without mouths, without jaws, without faces; we find one man\r\nwho has held the artery of his arm in his teeth for two hours in\r\norder not to bleed to death.  The sun goes down, night comes, the\r\nshells whine, life is at an end.\r\n\r\nStill the little piece of convulsed earth in which we lie is held.\r\nWe have yielded no more than a few hundred yards of it as a prize to\r\nthe enemy.  But on every yard there lies a dead man.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nWe have been relieved.  The wheels roll beneath us, we stand dully,\r\nand when the call \"Mind--wire\" comes, we bend our knees.  It was\r\nsummer when we came up, the trees were still green, now it is autumn\r\nand the night is grey and wet.  The lorries stop, we climb out--a\r\nconfused heap, a remnant of many names.  On either side stand people,\r\ndark, calling out the numbers of the regiments, the companies.  And\r\nat each call a little group separates itself off, a small handful of\r\ndirty, pallid soldiers, a dreadfully small handful, and a dreadfully\r\nsmall remnant.\r\n\r\nNow someone is calling the number of our company, it is, yes, the\r\nCompany-Commander, he has got one too, his arm is in a sling.  We go\r\nover to him and I recognize Kat and Albert, we stand together, lean\r\nagainst each other, and look at one another.\r\n\r\nAnd we hear the number of our company called again and again.  He\r\nwill call a long time, they do not hear him in the hospitals and\r\nshell-holes.\r\n\r\nOnce again: \"Second Company, this way!\"\r\n\r\nAnd then more softly: \"Nobody else Second Company?\"\r\n\r\nHe is silent, and then huskily he says: \"Is that all?\" and gives the\r\norder: \"Number!\"\r\n\r\nThe morning is grey, it was still summer when we came up, and we were\r\none hundred and fifty strong.  Now we freeze, it is autumn, the\r\nleaves rustle, the voices flutter out wearily:\r\n\"One--two--three--four----\" and cease at thirty-two.  And there is a\r\nlong silence before the voice asks: \"Anyone else?\"--and waits and\r\nthen says softly: \"In squads----\" and then breaks off and is only\r\nable to finish: \"Second Company----\" with difficulty: \"Second\r\nCompany--march easy!\"\r\n\r\nA line, a short line trudges off into the morning.\r\n\r\nThirty-two men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nThey have taken us farther back than usual to a field depot so that\r\nwe can be re-organized.  Our company needs more than a hundred\r\nreinforcements.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, when we are off duty, we loaf around.  After a\r\ncouple of days Himmelstoss comes up to us.  He has had the bounce\r\nknocked out of him since he has been in the trenches and wants to get\r\non good terms with us.  I am willing enough, because I saw how he\r\nbrought Haie Westhus in when he was hit in the back.  Besides he's\r\ndecent enough to treat us at the canteen when we are out of funds.\r\nOnly Tjaden is still reserved and suspicious.\r\n\r\nBut he is won over, too, when Himmelstoss tells us that he is taking\r\nthe place of the sergeant-cook who has gone on leave.  As a proof he\r\nproduces on the spot two pounds of sugar for us and a half-pound of\r\nbutter specially for Tjaden.  He even sees to it that we are detailed\r\nthe next two or three days to the cook house for potato and turnip\r\npeeling.  The grub he gives us there is real officers' fare.\r\n\r\nThus for the moment we have the two things a soldier needs for\r\ncontentment: good food and rest.  That's not much when one comes to\r\nthink of it.  A couple of years ago we would have despised ourselves\r\nterribly.  But now we are quite happy.  It is all a matter of\r\nhabit--even the front line.\r\n\r\nHabit is the explanation of why we seem to forget things so quickly.\r\nYesterday we were under fire, to-day we act the fool and go foraging\r\nthrough the countryside, to-morrow we go up to the trenches again.\r\nWe forget nothing really.  But so long as we have to stay here in the\r\nfield, the front-line days, when they are past, sink down in us like\r\na stone; they are too serious for us to be able to reflect on them at\r\nonce.  If we did that, we should have been destroyed long ago.  I\r\nsoon found out this much:--terror can be endured so long as a man\r\nsimply ducks;--but it kills, if a man thinks about it.\r\n\r\nJust as we turn into animals when we go up to the line, because that\r\nis the only thing which brings us through safely, so we turn into\r\nwags and loafers when we are out resting.  We can do nothing else, it\r\nis a sheer necessity.  We want to live at any price; so we cannot\r\nburden ourselves with feelings which, though they might be ornamental\r\nenough in peace time, would be out of place here.  Kemmerich is dead,\r\nHaie Westhus is dying, they will have a job with Hans Kramer's body\r\nat the Judgment Day, piecing it together after a direct hit; Martens\r\nhas no legs any more, Meyer is dead, Max is dead, Beyer is dead,\r\nHammerling is dead, there are a hundred and twenty wounded men lying\r\nsomewhere or other; it is a damnable business, but what has it to do\r\nwith us now--we live.  If it were possible for us to save them, then\r\nit would be seen how much we cared--we would have a shot at it though\r\nwe went under ourselves; for we can be damned quixotic when we like;\r\nfear we do not know much about--terror of death, yes; but that is a\r\ndifferent matter, that is physical.\r\n\r\nBut our comrades are dead, we cannot help them, they have their\r\nrest--and who knows what is waiting for us?  We will make ourselves\r\ncomfortable and sleep, and eat as much as we can stuff into our\r\nbellies, and drink and smoke so that the hours are not wasted.  Life\r\nis short.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nThe terror of the front sinks deep down when we turn our backs upon\r\nit; we make grim, coarse jests about it, when a man dies, then we say\r\nhe had nipped off his turd, and so we speak of everything; that keeps\r\nus from going mad; as long as we take it that way we maintain our own\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\nBut we do not forget.  It's all rot that they put in the war-news\r\nabout the good humour of the troops, how they are arranging dances\r\nalmost before they are out of the front-line.  We don't act like that\r\nbecause we are in a good humour: we are in a good humour because\r\notherwise we should go to pieces.  If it were not so we could not\r\nhold out much longer; our humour becomes more bitter every month.\r\n\r\nAnd this I know: all these things that now, while we are still in the\r\nwar, sink down in us like a stone, after the war shall waken again,\r\nand then shall begin the disentanglement of life and death.\r\n\r\nThe days, the weeks, the years out here shall come back again, and\r\nour dead comrades shall then stand up again and march with us, our\r\nheads shall be clear, we shall have a purpose, and so we shall march,\r\nour dead comrades beside us, the years at the Front behind\r\nus:--against whom, against whom?\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nSome time ago there was an army theatre in these parts.  Coloured\r\nposters of the performances are still sticking on a hoarding.  With\r\nwide eyes Kropp and I stand in front of it.  We can hardly credit\r\nthat such things still exist.  A girl in a light summer dress, with a\r\nred patent-leather belt about her hips!  She is standing with one\r\nhand on a railing and with the other she holds a straw hat.  She\r\nwears white stockings and white shoes, fine buckle shoes with high\r\nheels.  Behind her smiles a blue lake with white-horses, at the side\r\nis a bright bay.  She is a lovely girl with a delicate nose, red\r\nlips, and slender legs, wonderfully clean and well cared for, she\r\ncertainly bathes twice a day and never has any dirt under her nails.\r\nAt most perhaps a bit of sand from the beach.\r\n\r\nBeside her stands a man in white trousers, a bluejacket, and sailor's\r\ncap; but he interests us much less.\r\n\r\nThe girl on the poster is a wonder to us.  We have quite forgotten\r\nthat there are such things, and even now we hardly believe our eyes.\r\nWe have seen nothing like it for years, nothing like it for\r\nhappiness, beauty, and joy.  That is peace time, that is as it should\r\nbe; we feel excited.\r\n\r\n\"Just look at those thin shoes though, she couldn't march many miles\r\nin those,\" I say, and then begin to feel silly, for it is absurd to\r\nstand in front of a picture like this and think of nothing but\r\nmarching.\r\n\r\n\"How old would she be?\" Kropp asks.\r\n\r\n\"About twenty-two at the most,\" I hazard.\r\n\r\n\"Then she would be older than us!  She is not more than seventeen,\r\nlet me tell you!\"\r\n\r\nIt gives us goose-flesh.\r\n\r\n\"That would be good, Albert, what do you think?\"\r\n\r\nHe nods.  \"I have some white trousers at home too.\"\r\n\r\n\"White trousers,\" say I, \"but a girl like that----\"\r\n\r\nWe look askance at one another.  There's not much to boast of\r\nhere--two ragged, stained, and dirty uniforms.  It is hopeless to\r\ncompete.\r\n\r\nSo we proceed to tear the young man with the white trousers off the\r\nhoarding, taking care not to damage the girl.  That is something\r\ntowards it.\r\n\r\n\"We could go and get deloused, anyway,\" Kropp then suggests.\r\n\r\nI am not very enthusiastic because it doesn't do one's clothes any\r\ngood and a man is lousy again inside two hours.  But when we have\r\nconsidered the picture once more, I declare myself willing.  I even\r\ngo farther.\r\n\r\n\"We might see if we could get a clean shirt as well----\"\r\n\r\n\"Socks might be better,\" says Albert, not without reason.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, socks too perhaps.  Let's go and explore a bit.\"\r\n\r\nThen Leer and Tjaden stroll up; they look at the poster and\r\nimmediately the conversation becomes smutty.  Leer was the first of\r\nour class to have intercourse, and he gave stirring details of it.\r\nAfter his fashion he enjoys himself over the picture, and Tjaden\r\nsupports him nobly.\r\n\r\nIt does not distress us exactly.  Who isn't smutty is no soldier; it\r\nmerely does not suit us at the moment, so we edge away and march off\r\nto the delousing station with the same feeling as if it were a swell\r\ngentlemen's outfitters.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nThe houses in which we are billeted lie near the canal.  On the other\r\nside of the canal there are ponds flanked with poplars;--on the other\r\nside of the canal there are women too.\r\n\r\nThe houses on our side have been abandoned.  On the other side though\r\none occasionally sees inhabitants.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we go swimming.  Three women come strolling along the\r\nbank.  They walk slowly and don't look away, although we have no\r\nbathing suits.\r\n\r\nLeer calls out to them.  They laugh and stop to watch us.  We fling\r\nremarks at them in broken French, anything that comes into our heads,\r\nhastily and all jumbled together, anything to detain them.  They are\r\nnot specially wonderful pieces, but then where are such to be had\r\nabout here?\r\n\r\nThere is one slim little brunette.  Her teeth gleam when she laughs.\r\nShe has quick movements, her dress swings loosely about her legs.\r\nAlthough the water is cold we are very jovial and do our best to\r\ninterest them so that they will stay.  We try to make jokes and they\r\nanswer with things we cannot understand; we laugh and beckon.  Tjaden\r\nis more crafty.  He runs into the house, gets a loaf of army bread\r\nand holds it up.\r\n\r\nThat produces a great effect.  They nod and beckon us to come over.\r\nBut we don't dare to do that.  It is forbidden to cross to the\r\nopposite bank.  There are sentries on all the bridges.  It's\r\nimpossible without a pass.  So we indicate that they should come over\r\nto us; but they shake their heads and point to the bridge.  They are\r\nnot allowed to pass either.  They turn away and walk slowly down the\r\ncanal, keeping along the tow-path all the way.  We accompany them\r\nswimming.  After a few hundred yards they turn off and point to a\r\nhouse that stands a little distance away among the trees and\r\nshrubbery.\r\n\r\nLeer asks if they live there.\r\n\r\nThey laugh--sure, that's their house.\r\n\r\nWe call out to them that we would like to come, sometime when the\r\nguards cannot see us.  At night.  To-night.\r\n\r\nThey raise their hands, put them together, rest their faces on them\r\nand shut their eyes.  They understand.  The slim brunette does a\r\ntwo-step.  The blonde girl twitters: \"Bread--good----\"\r\n\r\nEagerly we assure them that we will bring some with us.  And other\r\ntasty bits too, we roll our eyes and try to explain with our hands.\r\nLeer nearly drowns trying to demonstrate a sausage.  If it were\r\nnecessary we would promise them a whole quartermaster's store.  They\r\ngo off and frequently turn and look back.  We climb out on the bank\r\non our side of the canal and watch to see whether they go into the\r\nhouse for they might easily have been lying.  Then we swim back.\r\n\r\nNo one can cross the bridge without leave, so we will simply have to\r\nswim over at night.  We are full of excitement.  We cannot last out\r\nwithout a drink, so we go to the canteen where there is beer and a\r\nkind of punch.\r\n\r\nWe drink punch and tell one another lying tales of our experiences.\r\nEach man gladly believes the other man's story, only waiting\r\nimpatiently till he can cap it with a taller one.  Our hands are\r\nfidgety, we smoke countless cigarettes, until Kropp says: \"We might\r\nas well take them a couple of cigarettes too.\"  So we put some inside\r\nour caps to keep them.\r\n\r\nThe sky turns apple-green.  There are four of us, but only three can\r\ngo; we must shake off Tjaden, so ply him with rum and punch until he\r\nrocks.  As it turns dark we go to our billets, Tjaden in the centre.\r\nWe are all glowing and full of a lust for adventure.\r\n\r\nThe little brunette is mine, we settled that by cutting for her.\r\n\r\nTjaden drops on his sack of straw and snores.  Once he wakes up and\r\ngrins so craftily that we are alarmed and begin to think he is\r\ncheating, and that we have given him the punch to no purpose.  Then\r\nhe drops back again and sleeps on.\r\n\r\nWe each get hold of a whole army loaf and wrap it up in newspaper.\r\nThe cigarettes we put in too, as well as three good rations of\r\nliver-sausage that were issued to us this evening.  That makes a\r\ndecent present.\r\n\r\nWe stow the things carefully in our boots; we have to take them to\r\nprotect our feet against treading on wire and broken glass on the\r\nother bank.  As we must swim for it we can take no other clothes.\r\nBut it is not far and quite dark.\r\n\r\nWe make off with our boots in our hands.  Swiftly we slip into the\r\nwater, lie on our backs and swim, holding the boots with their\r\ncontents up over our heads.\r\n\r\nWe climb out carefully on the opposite bank, take out the packages\r\nand put on our boots.  We put the things under our arms.  And so, all\r\nwet and naked, clothed only in our boots, we break into a trot.  We\r\nfind the house at once.  It lies among the trees.  Leer trips over a\r\nroot and skins his elbows.\r\n\r\n\"No matter,\" he says gaily.\r\n\r\nThe windows are shuttered.  We slip round the house and try to peer\r\nthrough the cracks.  Then we grow impatient.  Suddenly Kropp\r\nhesitates:\r\n\r\n\"What if there's a Major in with them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we just clear off,\" grins Leer, \"he can try to read our\r\nregimental numbers here,\" and smacks his behind.\r\n\r\nThe door of the court-yard stands open.  Our boots make a great\r\nclatter.  The house door opens, a chink of light shines through and a\r\nwoman cries out in a scared voice.\r\n\r\n\"Ssh, ssh! camerade--bon ami--\" we say, and show our packages\r\nprotestingly.\r\n\r\nThe other two are now on the scene, the door opens wide and the light\r\nfloods over us.  They recognize us and all three burst into laughter\r\nat our appearance.  They rock and sway in the doorway, they laugh so\r\nmuch.  How supple their movements are!\r\n\r\n\"Un moment--\"  They disappear and throw us bits of clothing which we\r\ngladly wrap round ourselves.  Then we venture in.  A small lamp burns\r\nin the room, which is warm and smells a little of perfume.  We unwrap\r\nour parcels and hand them over to the women.  Their eyes shine, it is\r\nobvious that they are hungry.\r\n\r\nThen we all become rather embarrassed.  Leer makes the gestures of\r\neating, and then they come to life again and bring out plates and\r\nknives and fall to on the food, and they hold up every slice of\r\nliver-sausage and admire it before they eat it, and we sit proudly by.\r\n\r\nThey overwhelm us with their chatter;--we understand very little of\r\nit, but we listen and the words sound friendly.  No doubt we all look\r\nvery young.  The little brunette strokes my hair and says what all\r\nthe French women say: \"La guerre--grand malheur--pauvres garçons----\"\r\n\r\nI hold her arm tightly and press my lips into the palm of her hand.\r\nHer fingers close round my face.  Close above me are her bewildering\r\neyes, the soft brown of her skin and her red lips.  Her mouth speaks\r\nwords I do not understand.  Nor do I fully understand her eyes; they\r\nseem to say more than we anticipated when we came here.\r\n\r\nThere are other rooms adjoining.  In passing I see Leer, he has made\r\na great hit with the blonde.  And he knows it, too.  But I--I am lost\r\nin remoteness, in weakness, and in a passion to which I yield myself\r\ntrustingly.  My desires are strangely compounded of yearning and\r\nmisery.  I feel giddy, there is nothing here that a man can hold on\r\nto.  We have left our boots at the door, they have given us slippers\r\ninstead, and now nothing remains to recall for me the assurance and\r\nself-confidence of the soldier: no rifle, no belt, no tunic, no cap.\r\nI let myself drop into the unknown, come what may--yet, in spite of\r\nall, I feel somewhat afraid.\r\n\r\nThe little brunette contracts her brows when she is thinking; but\r\nwhen she talks they are still.  And often the sound does not quite\r\nbecome a word but suffocates or floats away over me half-finished; an\r\narch, a pathway, a comet.  What have I known of it--what do I know of\r\nit?--The words of this foreign tongue, that I hardly understand, they\r\ncaress me to a quietness, in which the room grows dim, and dissolves\r\nin the half light, and only the face above me lives and is clear.\r\n\r\nHow various is a face; but an hour ago it was strange and now it is\r\ntouched with a tenderness that comes, not from it, but out of the\r\nnight, the world and the blood, all these things seem to shine in it\r\ntogether.  The objects in the room are touched by it and transformed,\r\nthey become isolated, and I feel almost awed at the sight of my clear\r\nskin when the light of the lamp falls upon it and the cool, brown\r\nhand passes over it.\r\n\r\nHow different all this is from the conditions in the soldier's\r\nbrothels, to which we are allowed to go, and where we have to wait in\r\nlong queues.  I wish I never thought of them; but desire turns my\r\nmind to them involuntarily and I am afraid, for it might be\r\nimpossible ever to be free of them again.\r\n\r\nBut then I feel the lips of the little brunette and press myself\r\nagainst them, my eyes close and I let it all fall from me, war and\r\nterror and grossness, in order to awaken young and happy; I think of\r\nthe picture of the girl on the poster and, for a moment, believe that\r\nmy life depends on winning her.  And if I press ever deeper into the\r\narms that embrace me, perhaps a miracle may happen....\r\n\r\n. . . . . . . .\r\n\r\nSo, after a time we find ourselves reassembled again.  Leer is in\r\nhigh spirits.  We pull on our boots and take our leave warmly.  The\r\nnight air cools our hot bodies.  The rustling poplars loom large in\r\nthe darkness.  The moon floats in the heavens and in the waters of\r\nthe canal.  We do not run, we walk beside one another with long\r\nstrides.\r\n\r\n\"That was worth a ration-loaf,\" says Leer.\r\n\r\nI cannot trust myself to speak, I am not in the least happy.\r\n\r\nThen we hear footsteps and dodge behind a shrub.\r\n\r\nThe steps come nearer, close by us.  We see a naked soldier, in\r\nboots, just like ourselves; he has a package under his arm, and\r\ngallops onward.  It is Tjaden in full course.  He has disappeared\r\nalready.\r\n\r\nWe laugh.  In the morning he will curse us.\r\n\r\nUnobserved, we arrive again at our sacks of straw.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nI am called to the Orderly Room.  The Company Commander gives me a\r\nleave-pass and a travel-pass and wishes me a good journey.  I look to\r\nsee how much leave I have got.  Seventeen days--fourteen days leave\r\nand three days for travelling.  It is not enough and I ask whether I\r\ncannot have five days for travelling.  Bertinck points to my pass.\r\nThere I see that I am not to return to the front immediately.  After\r\nmy leave I have to report for a course of training to a camp on the\r\nmoors.\r\n\r\nThe others congratulate me.  Kat gives me good advice, and tells me I\r\nought to try to get a base-job.  \"If you are smart, you'll hang on to\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nI would rather not have gone for another eight days; we are to stay\r\nhere that much longer and it is good here.\r\n\r\nNaturally I have to stand the others drinks at the canteen.  We are\r\nall a little bit drunk.  I become gloomy: I will be away for six\r\nweeks--  That is lucky of course, but what may happen before I get\r\nback?  Shall I meet all these fellows again?  Already Haie has\r\ngone--who will the next be?\r\n\r\nAs we drink, I look at each of them in turn.  Albert sits beside me\r\nand smokes, he is silent, we have always been together;--opposite\r\nsquats Kat, with his drooping shoulders, his broad thumb, and calm\r\nvoice--Müller with the protruding teeth and the booming laugh; Tjaden\r\nwith his mousey eyes;--Leer who has grown a full beard and looks at\r\nleast forty.\r\n\r\nOver us hangs a dense cloud of smoke.  Where would a soldier be\r\nwithout tobacco.  The canteen is his refuge, and beer is far more\r\nthan a drink, it is a token that a man can move his limbs and stretch\r\nin safety.  We do it ceremonially, we stretch our legs out in front\r\nof us and spit deliberately, that is the only way.  How it all rises\r\nup before a man when he is going away the next morning!\r\n\r\nAt night we go again to the other side of the canal.  I am almost\r\nafraid to tell the little brunette that I am going away, and when I\r\nreturn we will certainly be far away from here; we will never see one\r\nanother again.  But she merely nods and takes no special notice.  At\r\nfirst I am at a loss to understand, then it suddenly dawns on me.\r\nYes, Leer is right: if I were going up to the front, then she would\r\nhave again called me \"pauvre garçon\"; but merely going on leave--she\r\ndoes not want to hear about that, that is not nearly so interesting.\r\nMay she go to the devil with her chattering talk.  A man dreams of a\r\nmiracle and wakes up to loaves of bread.\r\n\r\nNext morning, after I have been de-loused, I go to the rail head.\r\nAlbert and Kat come with me.  At the halt we learn that it will be a\r\ncouple of hours yet before the train leaves.  The other two have to\r\ngo back to duty.  We take leave of one another.\r\n\r\n\"Good luck, Kat; good luck, Albert.\"\r\n\r\nThey go off and wave once or twice.  Their figures dwindle.  I know\r\ntheir every step and movement; I would recognize them at any\r\ndistance.  Then they disappear.  I sit down on my pack and wait.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I become filled with a consuming impatience to be gone.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nI lie down on many a station platform; I stand before many a\r\nsoup-kitchen; I squat on many a bench;--then at last the landscape\r\nbecomes gloomy, mysterious, and familiar.  It glides past the western\r\nwindows with its villages, their thatched roofs like caps, pulled\r\nover the white-washed, half-timbered houses, its corn-fields,\r\ngleaming like mother-of-pearl in the slanting light, its orchards,\r\nits barns and old lime trees.\r\n\r\nThe names of the stations begin to take on meaning and my heart\r\ntrembles.  The train stamps and stamps onward, I stand at the window\r\nand hold on to the frame.  These names mark the boundaries of my\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\nSmooth meadows, fields, farm-yards; a solitary team moves against the\r\nsky-line along the road that runs parallel to the horizon--a barrier,\r\nbefore which peasants stand waiting, girls waving, children playing\r\non the embankment, roads, leading into the country, smooth roads\r\nwithout artillery.\r\n\r\nIt is evening, and if the train did not rattle I should cry out.  The\r\nplain unfolds itself.\r\n\r\nIn the distance, the soft, blue silhouette of the mountain ranges\r\nbegins to appear.  I recognize the characteristic outline of the\r\nDolbenberg, a jagged comb, springing up precipitously from the limit\r\nof the forests.  Behind it should lie the town.\r\n\r\nBut now the sun streams through the world, dissolving everything in\r\nits golden-red light, the train swings round one curve and then\r\nanother;--far away, in a long line one behind the other, stand the\r\npoplars, unsubstantial, swaying and dark, fashioned out of shadow,\r\nlight, and desire.\r\n\r\nThe field swings round as the train encircles it, and the intervals\r\nbetween the trees diminish; the trees become a block and for a moment\r\nI see one only--then they reappear from behind the foremost tree and\r\nstand out a long line against the sky until they are hidden by the\r\nfirst houses.\r\n\r\nA street-crossing.  I stand at the window, I cannot drag myself away.\r\nThe others put their baggage ready for getting out.  I repeat to\r\nmyself the name of the Street that we cross\r\nover--Bremerstrasse--Bremerstrasse--\r\n\r\nBelow there are cyclists, lorries, men; it is a grey street and a\r\ngrey subway;--it embraces me as though it were my mother.\r\n\r\nThen the train stops, and there is the station with noise and cries\r\nand sentries.  I pick up my pack and fasten the straps, I take my\r\nrifle in my hand and stumble down the steps.\r\n\r\nOn the platform I look round; I know no one among all the people\r\nhurrying to and fro.  A red-cross sister offers me something to\r\ndrink.  I turn away, she smiles at me too foolishly, so obsessed with\r\nher own importance: \"Just look, I am giving a soldier coffee!\"--She\r\ncalls me \"Comrade,\" but I will have none of it.\r\n\r\nOutside in front of the station the stream roars alongside the\r\nstreet, it rushes foaming from the sluices of the mill bridge.  There\r\nstands the old, square watch-tower, in front of it the great mottled\r\nlime tree and behind it the evening.\r\n\r\nHere we have often sat--how long ago it is--; we have passed over\r\nthis bridge and breathed the cool, acid smell of the stagnant water;\r\nwe have leaned over the still water on this side of the lock, where\r\nthe green creepers and weeds hang from the piles of the bridge;--and\r\non hot days we rejoiced in the spouting foam on the other side of the\r\nlock and told tales about our school-teachers.\r\n\r\nI pass over the bridge, I look right and left; the water is as full\r\nof weeds as ever, and it still shoots over in gleaming arches; in the\r\ntower-building laundresses still stand with bare arms as they used to\r\nover the clean linen, and the heat from the ironing pours out through\r\nthe open windows.  Dogs trot along the narrow street, before the\r\ndoors of the houses people stand and follow me with their gaze as I\r\npass by, dirty and heavy laden.\r\n\r\nIn this confectioner's we used to eat ices, and there we learned to\r\nsmoke cigarettes.  Walking down the street I know every shop, the\r\ncolonial warehouse, the chemist's, the tobacconist's.  Then at last I\r\nstand before the brown door with its worn latch and my hand grows\r\nheavy.  I open the door and a wonderful freshness comes out to meet\r\nme, my eyes are dim.\r\n\r\nThe stairs creak under my boots.  Upstairs a door rattles, someone is\r\nlooking over the railing.  It is the kitchen door that was opened,\r\nthey are cooking potato-cakes, the house reeks of it, and to-day of\r\ncourse is Saturday; that will be my sister leaning over.  For a\r\nmoment I am shy and lower my head, then I take off my helmet and look\r\nup.  Yes, it is my eldest sister.\r\n\r\n\"Paul,\" she cries, \"Paul----\"\r\n\r\nI nod, my pack bumps against the banisters; my rifle is so heavy.\r\n\r\nShe pulls a door open and calls: \"Mother, mother, Paul is here.\"\r\n\r\nI can go no further--mother, mother, Paul is here.\r\n\r\nI lean against the wall and grip my helmet and rifle.  I hold them as\r\ntight as I can, but I cannot take another step, the staircase fades\r\nbefore my eyes, I support myself with the butt of my rifle against my\r\nfeet and clench my teeth fiercely, but I cannot speak a word, my\r\nsister's call has made me powerless, I can do nothing, I struggle to\r\nmake myself laugh, to speak, but no word comes, and so I stand on the\r\nsteps, miserable, helpless, paralysed, and against my will the tears\r\nrun down my cheeks.\r\n\r\nMy sister comes back and says: \"Why, what is the matter?\"\r\n\r\nThen I pull myself together and stagger on to the landing.  I lean my\r\nrifle in a corner, I set my pack against the wall, place my helmet on\r\nit, and fling down my equipment and baggage.  Then I say fiercely:\r\n\"Bring me a handkerchief.\"\r\n\r\nShe gives me one from the cupboard and I dry my face.  Above me on\r\nthe wall hangs the glass case with the coloured butterflies that once\r\nI collected.\r\n\r\nNow I hear my mother's voice.  It comes from the bedroom.\r\n\r\n\"Is she in bed?\" I ask my sister.\r\n\r\n\"She is ill--\" she replies.\r\n\r\nI go in to her, give her my hand and say as calmly as I can: \"Here I\r\nam, mother.\"\r\n\r\nShe lies still in the dim light.  Then she asks anxiously:\r\n\r\n\"Are you wounded?\" and I feel her searching glance.\r\n\r\n\"No, I have got leave.\"\r\n\r\nMy mother is very pale.  I am afraid to make a light.\r\n\r\n\"Here I lie now,\" says she, \"and cry instead of being glad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you sick, mother?\" I ask.\r\n\r\n\"I am going to get up a little to-day,\" she says and turns to my\r\nsister, who is continually running to the kitchen to watch that the\r\nfood does not burn: \"And put out the jar of preserved\r\nwhortleberries--you like that, don't you?\" she asks me.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, mother, I haven't had any for a long time.\"\r\n\r\n\"We might almost have known you were coming,\" laughs my sister,\r\n\"there is just your favourite dish, potato-cakes, and even\r\nwhortleberries to go with them too.\"\r\n\r\n\"And it is Saturday,\" I add.\r\n\r\n\"Sit here beside me,\" says my mother.\r\n\r\nShe looks at me.  Her hands are white and sickly and frail compared\r\nwith mine.  We say very little, and I am thankful that she asks\r\nnothing.  What ought I to say?  Everything I could have wished for\r\nhas happened.  I have come out of it safely and sit here beside her.\r\nAnd in the kitchen stands my sister making the evening bread and\r\nsinging.\r\n\r\n\"Dear boy,\" says my mother softly.\r\n\r\nWe were never very demonstrative in our family; poor folk who toil\r\nand are full of cares are not so.  It is not their way to protest\r\nwhat they already know.  When my mother says to me \"dear boy,\" it\r\nmeans much more than when another uses it.  I know well enough that\r\nthe jar of whortleberries is the only one they have had for months,\r\nand that she has kept it for me; and the somewhat stale cakes that\r\nshe gives me too.  She has taken a favourable opportunity of getting\r\na few and has put them all by for me.\r\n\r\nI sit by her bed, and through the window the chestnut trees in the\r\nbeer garden opposite glow in brown and gold.  I breathe deeply and\r\nsay over to myself:--\"You are at home, you are at home.\"  But a sense\r\nof strangeness will not leave me, I can find nothing of myself in all\r\nthese things.  There is my mother, there is my sister, there my case\r\nof butterflies, and there the mahogany piano--but I am not myself\r\nthere.  There is a distance, a veil between us.\r\n\r\nI go and fetch my pack to the bedside and turn out the things I have\r\nbrought--a whole Edamer cheese, that Kat provided me with, two loaves\r\nof army bread, three-quarters of a pound of butter, two tins of\r\nliver-sausage, a pound of dripping and a little bag of rice.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you can make some use of that----\"\r\n\r\nThey nod.\r\n\r\n\"Is it pretty bad for food here?\" I enquire.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there's not much.  Do you get enough out there?\"\r\n\r\nI smile and point to the things I have brought.  \"Not always quite so\r\nmuch as that, of course, but we fare reasonably well.\"\r\n\r\nErna goes out to bring in the food.  Suddenly my mother seizes hold\r\nof my hand and asks falteringly: \"Was it very bad out there, Paul?\"\r\n\r\nMother, what should I answer to that!  You would not understand, and\r\nnever realize it.  And you never should realize it.  Was it bad, you\r\nask.--You, Mother,--I shake my head and say: \"No, mother, not so\r\nvery.  There are always a lot of us together so it isn't so bad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but Heinrich Bredemeyer was here just lately and he said it was\r\nterrible out there now, with the gas and all the rest of it.\"\r\n\r\nIt is my mother who says that.  She says: \"With the gas and all the\r\nrest of it.\"  She does not know what she is saying, she is merely\r\nanxious for me.  Should I tell her how we once found three enemy\r\ntrenches with their garrison all stiff as though stricken with\r\napoplexy?  Against the parapet, in the dugouts, just where they were,\r\nthe men stood and lay about, with blue faces, dead.\r\n\r\n\"No, mother, that's only talk,\" I answer, \"there's not very much in\r\nwhat Bredemeyer says.  You see for instance, I'm well and fit----\"\r\n\r\nBefore my mother's tremulous anxiety I recover my composure.  Now I\r\ncan walk about and talk and answer questions without fear of having\r\nsuddenly to lean against the wall because the world turns soft as\r\nrubber and my veins become brimstone.\r\n\r\nMy mother wants to get up.  So I go for a while to my sister in the\r\nkitchen.  \"What is the matter with her?\" I ask.\r\n\r\nShe shrugs her shoulders: \"She has been in bed two months now, but we\r\ndid not want to write and tell you.  Several doctors have been to see\r\nher.  One of them said it is probably cancer again.\"\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nI go to the district commandant to report myself.  Slowly I wander\r\nthrough the streets.  Occasionally someone speaks to me.  I do not\r\ndelay long for I have little inclination to talk.\r\n\r\nOn my way back from the barracks a loud voice calls out to me.  Still\r\nlost in thought I turn round and find myself confronted by a Major.\r\n\"Can't you salute?\" he blusters.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, Major,\" I say in embarrassment, \"I didn't notice you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you know how to speak properly?\" he roars.\r\n\r\nI would like to hit him in the face, but control myself, for my leave\r\ndepends on it.  I click my heels and say: \"I did not see you, Herr\r\nMajor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then keep your eyes open,\" he snorts.\r\n\r\n\"What is your name?\"  I give it.\r\n\r\nHis fat red face is furious.  \"What regiment?\"\r\n\r\nI give him full particulars.  Even yet he has not had enough.  \"Where\r\nare they?\"\r\n\r\nBut I have had more than enough and say: \"Between Langemark and\r\nBixschoote.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh?\" he asks, a bit stupefied.\r\n\r\nI explain to him that I arrived on leave only an hour or two since,\r\nthinking that he would then trot along.  But not at all.  He gets\r\neven more furious: \"You think you can bring your front-line manners\r\nhere, what?  Well, we don't stand that sort of thing.  Thank God, we\r\nhave discipline here!\"\r\n\r\n\"Twenty paces backwards, double march!\" he commands.\r\n\r\nI am mad with rage.  But I cannot say anything to him; he could put\r\nme under arrest if he liked.  So I double back, and then march up to\r\nhim.  Six paces from him I spring to a stiff salute and maintain it\r\nuntil I am six paces beyond him.\r\n\r\nHe calls me back again and affably gives me to understand that for\r\nonce he is pleased to put mercy before justice.  I pretend to be duly\r\ngrateful.  \"Now, dismiss!\" he says.  I turn about smartly and march\r\noff.\r\n\r\nThat ruins the evening for me.  I go back home and throw my uniform\r\ninto a corner; I ought to have done that before.  Then I take out my\r\ncivilian clothes from the wardrobe and put them on.\r\n\r\nI feel awkward.  The suit is rather tight and short, I have grown in\r\nthe army.  Collar and tie give me some trouble.  In the end my sister\r\nties the bow for me.  But how light the suit is, it feels as though I\r\nhad nothing on but a shirt and underpants.\r\n\r\nI look at myself in the glass.  It is a strange sight.  A sunburnt,\r\novergrown candidate for confirmation gazes at me in astonishment.\r\n\r\nMy mother is pleased to see me wearing civilian clothes; it makes me\r\nless strange to her.  But my father would rather I kept my uniform on\r\nso that he could take me to visit his acquaintances.\r\n\r\nBut I refuse.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to sit quietly somewhere, in the beer-garden for\r\nexample, under the chestnuts by the skittle-alley.  The leaves fall\r\ndown on the table and on the ground, only a few, the first.  A glass\r\nof beer stands in front of me, I've learned to drink in the army.\r\nThe glass is half empty, but there are still a few good swigs ahead\r\nof me, and besides I can always order a second and a third if I wish\r\nto.  There are no bugles and no bombardments, the children of the\r\nhouse play in the skittle-alley, and the dog rests his head against\r\nmy knee.  The sky is blue, between the leaves of the chestnuts rises\r\nthe green spire of St. Margaret's Church.\r\n\r\nThis is good, I like it.  But I cannot get on with the people.  My\r\nmother is the only one who asks no questions.  Not so my father.  He\r\nwants me to tell him about the front; he is curious in a way that I\r\nfind stupid and distressing; I no longer have any real contact with\r\nhim.  There is nothing he likes more than just hearing about it.  I\r\nrealize he does not know that a man cannot talk of such things; I\r\nwould do it willingly, but it is too dangerous for me to put these\r\nthings into words.  I am afraid they might then become gigantic and I\r\nbe no longer able to master them.  What would become of us if\r\neverything that happens out there were quite clear to us?\r\n\r\nSo I confine myself to telling him a few amusing things.  But he\r\nwants to know whether I have ever had a hand-to-hand fight.  I say\r\n\"No,\" and get up and go out.\r\n\r\nBut that does not mend matters.  After I have been startled a couple\r\nof times in the street by the screaming of the tramcars, which\r\nresembles the shriek of a shell coming straight for one, somebody\r\ntaps me on the shoulder.  It is my German-master, and he fastens on\r\nme with the usual question: \"Well, how are things out there?\r\nTerrible, terrible, eh?  Yes, it is dreadful, but we must carry on.\r\nAnd after all, you do at least get decent food out there, so I hear.\r\nYou look well, Paul, and fit.  Naturally it's worse here.  Naturally.\r\nThe best for our soldiers every time, that goes without saying.\"\r\n\r\nHe drags me along to a table with a lot of others.  They welcome me,\r\na head-master shakes hands with me and says: \"So you come from the\r\nfront?  What is the spirit like out there?  Excellent, eh? excellent?\"\r\n\r\nI explain that no one would be sorry to be back home.\r\n\r\nHe laughs uproariously.  \"I can well believe it!  But first you have\r\nto give the Froggies a good hiding.  Do you smoke?  Here, try one.\r\nWaiter, bring a beer as well for our young warrior.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I have accepted the cigar, so I have to remain.  And\r\nthey are all so dripping with good will that it is impossible to\r\nobject.  All the same I feel annoyed and smoke like a chimney as hard\r\nas I can.  In order to make at least some show of appreciation I toss\r\noff the beer in one gulp.  Immediately a second is ordered; people\r\nknow how much they are indebted to the soldiers.  They argue about\r\nwhat we ought to annex.  The head-master with the steel watch-chain\r\nwants to have at least the whole of Belgium, the coal-areas of\r\nFrance, and a slice of Russia.  He produces reasons why we must have\r\nthem and is quite inflexible until at last the others give in to him.\r\nThen he begins to expound just whereabouts in France the\r\nbreak-through must come, and turns to me: \"Now, shove ahead a bit out\r\nthere with your everlasting trench warfare--Smash through the\r\njohnnies and then there will be peace.\"\r\n\r\nI reply that in our opinion a break-through may not be possible.  The\r\nenemy may have too many reserves.  Besides, the war may be rather\r\ndifferent from what people think.\r\n\r\nHe dismisses the idea loftily and informs me I know nothing about it.\r\n\"The details, yes,\" says he, \"but this relates to the whole.  And of\r\nthat you are not able to judge.  You see only your little sector and\r\nso cannot have any general survey.  You do your duty, you risk your\r\nlives, that deserves the highest honour--every man of you ought to\r\nhave the Iron Cross--but first of all the enemy line must be broken\r\nthrough in Flanders and then rolled up from the top.\"\r\n\r\nHe blows his nose and wipes his beard.  \"Completely rolled up they\r\nmust be, from the top to the bottom.  And then to Paris.\"\r\n\r\nI would like to know just how he pictures it to himself, and pour the\r\nthird glass of beer into me.  Immediately he orders another.\r\n\r\nBut I break away.  He stuffs a few more cigars into my pocket and\r\nsends me off with a friendly slap.  \"All of the best!  I hope we will\r\nsoon hear something worth while from you.\"\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nI imagined leave would be different from this.  Indeed, it was\r\ndifferent a year ago.  It is I of course that have changed in the\r\ninterval.  There lies a gulf between that time and to-day.  At that\r\ntime I still knew nothing about the war, we had been only in quiet\r\nsectors.  But now I see that I have been crushed without knowing it.\r\nI find I do not belong here any more, it is a foreign world.  Some of\r\nthese people ask questions, some ask no questions, but one can see\r\nthat they are quite confident they know all about it; they often say\r\nso with their air of comprehension, so there is no point in\r\ndiscussing it.  They make up a picture of it for themselves.\r\n\r\nI prefer to be alone, so that no one troubles me.  For they all come\r\nback to the same thing, how badly it goes and how well it goes; one\r\nthinks it is this way, another that; and yet they are always absorbed\r\nin the things that go to make up their own existence.  Formerly I\r\nlived in just the same way myself, but now I feel no contact here any\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\nThey talk to me too much.  They have worries, aims, desires, that I\r\ncannot comprehend.  I often sit with one of them in the little\r\nbeer-garden and try to explain to him that this is really the only\r\nthing: just to sit quietly, like this.  They understand of course,\r\nthey agree, they may even feel it so too, but only with words, only\r\nwith words, yes, that is it--they feel it, but always with only half\r\nof themselves, the rest of their being is taken up with other things,\r\nthey are so divided in themselves that none feels it with his whole\r\nessence; I cannot even say myself exactly what I mean.\r\n\r\nWhen I see them here, in their rooms, in their offices, about their\r\noccupations, I feel an irresistible attraction in it, I would like\r\nto be here too and forget the war; but also it repels me, it is so\r\nnarrow, how can that fill a man's life, he ought to smash it to bits;\r\nhow can they do it, while out at the front the splinters are whining\r\nover the shell-holes and the star-shells go up, the wounded are carried\r\nback on water-proof sheets and comrades crouch in the trenches.--They\r\nare different men here, men I cannot properly understand, whom I envy\r\nand despise. I must think of Kat and Albert and Müller and Tjaden,\r\nwhat will they be doing? No doubt they are sitting in the canteen, or\r\nperhaps swimming--soon they will have to go up to the front-line again.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nIn my room behind the table stands a brown leather sofa.  I sit down\r\non it.\r\n\r\nOn the walls are pasted countless pictures that I once used to cut\r\nout of the newspapers.  In between are drawings and postcards that\r\nhave come my way.  In the corner is a small iron stove.  Against the\r\nwall opposite stand the book-shelves with my books.\r\n\r\nI used to live in this room before I was a soldier.  The books I\r\nbought gradually with the money I earned by coaching.  Many of them\r\nare second-hand, all the classics for example, one volume in blue\r\ncloth boards cost one mark twenty pfennig.  I bought them complete\r\nbecause I was thoroughgoing, I did not trust the editors of\r\nselections, even though they may have chosen all the best.  So I\r\npurchased only \"collected works.\"  I read most of them with laudable\r\nzeal, but few of them really appealed to me.  I preferred the other\r\nbooks, the moderns, which were of course much dearer.  A few I came\r\nby not quite honestly, I borrowed and did not return them because I\r\ndid not want to part with them.\r\n\r\nOne shelf is filled with school books.  They are not so well cared\r\nfor, they are badly thumbed, and pages have been torn out for certain\r\npurposes.  Then below are periodicals, papers, and letters all jammed\r\nin together with drawings and rough sketches.\r\n\r\nI want to think myself back into that time.  It is still in the room,\r\nI feel it at once, the walls have preserved it.  My hands rest on the\r\narms of the sofa; now I make myself at home and draw up my legs so\r\nthat I sit comfortably in the corner, in the arms of the sofa.  The\r\nlittle window is open, through it I see the familiar picture of the\r\nstreet with the rising spire of the church at the end.  There are a\r\ncouple of flowers on the table.  Pen-holders, a shell as a\r\npaper-weight, the ink-well--here nothing is changed.\r\n\r\nIt will be like this too, if I am lucky, when the war is over and I\r\ncome back here for good.  I will sit here just like this and look at\r\nmy room and wait.\r\n\r\nI feel excited; but I do not want to be, for that is not right.  I\r\nwant that quiet rapture again.  I want to feel the same powerful,\r\nnameless urge that I used to feel when I turned to my books.  The\r\nbreath of desire that then arose from the coloured backs of the\r\nbooks, shall fill me again, melt the heavy, dead lump of lead that\r\nlies somewhere in me and waken again the impatience of the future,\r\nthe quick joy in the world of thought, it shall bring back again the\r\nlost eagerness of my youth.  I sit and wait.\r\n\r\nIt occurs to me that I must go and see Kemmerich's mother;--I might\r\nvisit Mittelstaedt too, he should be at the barracks.  I look out of\r\nthe window;--beyond the sober picture of the street appears a range\r\nof hills, distant and light; it changes to a clear day in autumn, and\r\nI sit by the fire with Kat and Albert and eat potatoes baked in their\r\nskins.\r\n\r\nBut I do not want to think of that, I sweep it away.  The room shall\r\nspeak, it must catch me up and hold me, I want to feel that I belong\r\nhere, I want to hearken and know when I go back to the front that the\r\nwar will sink down, be drowned utterly in the great home-coming tide,\r\nknow that it will then be past for ever, and not gnaw us continually,\r\nthat it will have none but an outward power over us.\r\n\r\nThe backs of the books stand in rows.  I know them all still, I\r\nremember arranging them in order.  I implore them with my eyes: Speak\r\nto me--take me up--take me, Life of my Youth--you who are care-free,\r\nbeautiful--receive me again--\r\n\r\nI wait, I wait.\r\n\r\nImages float through my mind, but they do not grip me, they are mere\r\nshadows and memories.\r\n\r\nNothing--nothing--\r\n\r\nMy disquietude grows.\r\n\r\nA terrible feeling of foreignness suddenly rises up in me.  I cannot\r\nfind my way back, I am shut out though I entreat earnestly and put\r\nforth all my strength.\r\n\r\nNothing stirs; listless and wretched, like a condemned man, I sit\r\nthere and the past withdraws itself.  And at the same time I fear to\r\nimportune it too much, because I do not know what might happen then.\r\nI am a soldier, I must cling to that.\r\n\r\nWearily I stand up and look out of the window.  Then I take one of\r\nthe books, intending to read, and turn over the leaves.  But I put it\r\naway and take out another.  There are passages in it that have been\r\nmarked.  I look, turn over the pages, take up fresh books.  Already\r\nthey are piled up beside me.  Speedily more join the heap, papers,\r\nmagazines, letters.\r\n\r\nI stand there dumb.  As before a judge.\r\n\r\nDejected.\r\n\r\nWords, Words, Words--they do not reach me.\r\n\r\nSlowly I place the books back in the shelves.\r\n\r\nNevermore.\r\n\r\nQuietly, I go out of the room.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nStill I do not give up hope.  I do not, indeed, go to my room any\r\nmore, but comfort myself with the thought that a few days are not\r\nenough to judge by.  Afterwards--later on--there is plenty of time\r\nfor that.\r\n\r\nSo I go over to see Mittelstaedt in the barracks, and we sit in his\r\nroom, there is an atmosphere about it that I do not like but with\r\nwhich I am quite familiar.\r\n\r\nMittelstaedt has some news ready for me that electrifies me on the\r\nspot.  He tells me Kantorek has been called up as a territorial.\r\n\r\n\"Just think of it,\" says he, and takes out a couple of good cigars,\r\n\"I come back here from the hospital and bump right into him.  He\r\nstretches out his paw to me and bleats: 'Hullo Mittelstaedt, how are\r\nyou?'--I look at him and say: 'Territorial Kantorek, business is\r\nbusiness and schnapps is schnapps, you ought to know that well enough\r\nyourself.  Stand to attention when you speak to a superior officer.'\r\nYou should have seen his face!  A cross between a dud and a pickled\r\ncucumber.  He tried once again to chum up.  So I snubbed him a bit\r\nharder.  Then he brought up his biggest guns and asked\r\nconfidentially: 'Would you like me to use my influence so that you\r\ncan take an emergency-exam.?'  He was trying to remind me of those\r\nthings, you know.  Then I got mad and I reminded him of something\r\ninstead.  'Territorial Kantorek, two years ago you preached us into\r\nenlisting; and among us there was one, Joseph Behm, who didn't want\r\nto enlist.  He was killed three months before he would have been\r\ncalled up in the ordinary way.  If it had not been for you he would\r\nhave lived just that much longer.  And now: Dismiss.  You will hear\r\nfrom me later.'  It was easy to get put in charge of his company.\r\nFirst thing I did was to take him to the stores and fit him out with\r\na suitable equipment.  You will see in a minute.\"\r\n\r\nWe go out to the parade ground.  The company has fallen in.\r\nMittelstaedt stands them at ease and inspects.\r\n\r\nThen I see Kantorek and am scarcely able to stifle my laughter.  He\r\nis wearing a faded blue tunic.  On the back and in the sleeves there\r\nare big dark patches.  The overcoat must have belonged to a giant.\r\nThe black, worn breeches are just as much too short; they reach\r\nbarely halfway down his calf.  The boots, tough old clod-hoppers,\r\nwith turned-up toes and laces at the side, are much too big for him.\r\nBut as a compensation the cap is too small, a terribly dirty, mean\r\nlittle pill-box.  The whole rig-out is just pitiful.\r\n\r\nMittelstaedt stops in front of him: \"Territorial Kantorek, do you\r\ncall those buttons polished?  You seem as though you can never learn.\r\nInadequate, Kantorek, quite inadequate----\"\r\n\r\nIt makes me bubble with glee.  In school Kantorek used to chasten\r\nMittelstaedt with exactly the same expression--\"Inadequate,\r\nMittelstaedt, quite inadequate.\"\r\n\r\nMittelstaedt continues to upbraid him: \"Look at Boettcher now,\r\nthere's a model for you to learn from.\"\r\n\r\nI can hardly believe my eyes.  Boettcher is there too, Boettcher, our\r\nschool porter.  And he is a model!  Kantorek shoots a glance at me as\r\nif he would like to eat me.  But I grin at him innocently, as though\r\nI do not recognize him any more.\r\n\r\nNothing could look more ludicrous than his forage-cap and his\r\nuniform.  And this is the object before whom we used to stand in\r\nanguish, as he sat up there enthroned at his desk, spearing at us\r\nwith his pencil for our mistakes in those irregular French verbs with\r\nwhich afterwards we made so little headway in France.  That is barely\r\ntwo years ago--and now here stands Territorial Kantorek, the spell\r\nquite broken, with bent knees, arms like pothooks, unpolished buttons\r\nand that ludicrous rig-out--an impossible soldier.  I cannot\r\nreconcile this with the menacing figure at the schoolmaster's desk.\r\nI wonder what I, the old soldier, would do if this skin full of woe\r\never dared to say to me again: \"Bäumer, give the imperfect of\r\n'aller.'\"\r\n\r\nThen Mittelstaedt makes them practice skirmishing, and as a favour\r\nappoints Kantorek squad leader.\r\n\r\nNow in skirmishing the squad leader has always to keep twenty paces\r\nin front of his squad; if the order comes \"On the march, about turn,\"\r\nthe line of skirmishers simply turns about, but the squad leader, who\r\nnow finds himself suddenly twenty paces in rear of the line, has to\r\nrush up at the double and take his position again twenty paces in\r\nfront of the squad.  That makes altogether forty paces double-march.\r\nBut no sooner has he arrived than the order \"On the march, about\r\nturn,\" comes again and he once more has to race at top speed another\r\nforty paces to the other side.  In this way the squad has made merely\r\nthe turn-about and a couple of paces while the squad-leader dashes\r\nbackwards and forwards like a fart on a curtain pole.  That is one of\r\nHimmelstoss' well-worn recipes.\r\n\r\nKantorek can hardly expect anything else from Mittelstaedt, for he\r\nonce messed up the latter's chance of promotion, and Mittelstaedt\r\nwould be a big fool not to make the best of such a good opportunity\r\nas this, before he goes back to the front again.  A man might well\r\ndie easier after the army has given him just one such stroke of luck.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Kantorek is dashing up and down like a wild-boar.\r\nAfter a while Mittelstaedt stops the skirmish and begins the very\r\nimportant exercise of creeping.\r\n\r\nOn hands and knees, carrying his gun in regulation fashion, Kantorek\r\nshoves his absurd figure over the sand immediately in front of us.\r\nHe is breathing hard, and his panting is music.\r\n\r\nMittelstaedt encourages Kantorek the Territorial with quotations from\r\nKantorek the schoolmaster.  \"Territorial Kantorek, we have the good\r\nfortune to live in a great age, we must all humble ourselves and for\r\nonce put aside bitterness.\"\r\n\r\nKantorek sweats and spits out a dirty piece of wood that has lodged\r\nin his teeth.\r\n\r\nMittelstaedt stoops down and says reproachfully: \"And in the trifles\r\nnever lose sight of the great adventure, Territorial Kantorek!\"\r\n\r\nIt amazes me that Kantorek does not explode with a bang, especially\r\nwhen, during physical exercises, Mittelstaedt copies him to\r\nperfection, seizing him by the seat of his trousers as he is climbing\r\nalong the horizontal bar, so that he can just raise his chin above\r\nthe beam, and then starts to give him good advice.  That is exactly\r\nwhat Kantorek used to do to him at school.\r\n\r\nThe extra fatigues are next detailed off.  \"Kantorek and Boettcher,\r\nbread fatigue!  Take the handcart with you.\"\r\n\r\nIn a couple of minutes the two set off together pushing the barrow.\r\nKantorek in a fury walks with his head down.  But the porter is\r\ndelighted to have scored light duty.\r\n\r\nThe bakehouse is away at the other end of the town, and the two must\r\ngo there and back through the whole length of it.\r\n\r\n\"They've done that a couple of times already,\" grins Mittelstaedt.\r\n\"There are still a few people waiting to see them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent,\" I say, \"but hasn't he reported you yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"He did try.  Our C.O. laughed like the deuce when he heard the\r\nstory.  He hasn't any time for schoolmasters.  Besides, I'm sweet\r\nwith his daughter.\"\r\n\r\n\"He'll mess up the examination for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care,\" says Mittelstaedt calmly.  \"Besides, his complaint\r\ncame to nothing because I could show that he had had hardly anything\r\nbut light duty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't you polish him up a bit?\" I ask.\r\n\r\n\"He's too stupid, I couldn't be bothered,\" answers Mittelstaedt\r\ncontemptuously.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nWhat is leave?--A pause that only makes everything after it so much\r\nworse.  Already the sense of parting begins to intrude itself.  My\r\nmother watches me silently,--I know she counts the days;--every\r\nmorning she is sad.  It is one day less.  She has put away my pack,\r\nshe does not want to be reminded by it.\r\n\r\nThe hours pass quickly if a man broods.  I pull myself together, and\r\ngo with my sister to the butcher's to get a pound of bones.  That is\r\na great luxury and people line up early in the morning and stand\r\nwaiting.  Many of them faint.\r\n\r\nWe have no luck.  After waiting by turns for three hours the queue\r\ndisperses.  The bones have not lasted out.\r\n\r\nIt is a good thing I get my rations.  I bring them to my mother and\r\nin that way we all get something decent to eat.\r\n\r\nThe days grow ever more strained and my mother's eyes more sorrowful.\r\nFour days left now.  I must go and see Kemmerich's mother.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nI cannot write that down.  This quaking, sobbing woman who shakes me\r\nand cries out on me: \"Why are you living then, when he is dead?\"--who\r\ndrowns me in tears and calls out: \"What are you there for at all,\r\nchild, when you----\"--who drops into a chair and wails: \"Did you see\r\nhim?  Did you see him then?  How did he die?\"\r\n\r\nI tell her he was shot through the heart and died instantaneously.\r\nShe looks at me, she doubts me: \"You lie.  I know better.  I have\r\nfelt how terribly he died.  I have heard his voice at night, I have\r\nfelt his anguish--tell the truth, I want to know it, I must know it.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I say, \"I was beside him.  He died at once.\"\r\n\r\nShe pleads with me gently: \"Tell me.  You must tell me.  I know you\r\nwant to comfort me, but don't you see, you torment me far more than\r\nif you told me the truth?  I cannot bear the uncertainty.  Tell me\r\nhow it was and even though it will be terrible, it will be far better\r\nthan what I have to think if you don't.\"\r\n\r\nI will never tell her, she can make mincemeat out of me first.  I\r\nconsole her, but she strikes me as rather stupid all the same.  Why\r\ndoesn't she stop worrying?  Kemmerich will stay dead whether she\r\nknows about it or not.  When a man has seen so many dead he cannot\r\nunderstand any longer why there should be so much anguish over a\r\nsingle individual.  So I say rather impatiently: \"He died\r\nimmediately.  He felt absolutely nothing at all.  His face was quite\r\ncalm.\"\r\n\r\nShe is silent.  Then she says slowly: \"Will you swear it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"By everything that is sacred to you?\"\r\n\r\nGood God, what is there that is sacred to me?--such things change\r\npretty quickly with us.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he died at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you willing never to come back yourself, if it isn't true?\"\r\n\r\n\"May I never come back if he wasn't killed instantaneously.\"\r\n\r\nI would swear to anything.  But she seems to believe me.  She moans\r\nand weeps steadily.  I have to tell how it happened so I invent a\r\nstory and I almost believe it myself.\r\n\r\nAs I leave she kisses me and gives me a picture of him.  In his\r\nrecruit's uniform he leans on a round rustic table with legs made of\r\nbirch branches.  Behind him a wood is painted on a curtain, and on\r\nthe table stands a mug of beer.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nIt is the last evening at home.  Everyone is silent.  I go to bed\r\nearly, I seize the pillow, press it against myself and bury my head\r\nin it.  Who knows if I will ever lie in a feather bed again?\r\n\r\nLate in the night my mother comes into my room.  She thinks I am\r\nasleep, and I pretend to be so.  To talk, to stay awake with one\r\nanother, it is too hard.\r\n\r\nShe sits long into the night although she is in pain and often\r\nwrithes.  At last I can bear it no longer, and pretend I have just\r\nwakened up.\r\n\r\n\"Go and sleep, mother, you will catch cold here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can sleep enough later,\" she says.\r\n\r\nI sit up.  \"I don't go straight back to the front, mother.  I have to\r\ndo four weeks at the training camp.  I may come over from there one\r\nSunday, perhaps.\"\r\n\r\nShe is silent.  Then she asks gently: \"Are you very much afraid?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would like to tell you to be on your guard against the women out\r\nin France.  They are no good.\"\r\n\r\nAh!  Mother, Mother!  You still think I am a child--why can I not put\r\nmy head in your lap and weep?  Why have I always to be strong and\r\nself-controlled?  I would like to weep and be comforted, too, indeed\r\nI am little more than a child; in the wardrobe still hang my short,\r\nboy's trousers--it is such a little time ago, why is it over?\r\n\r\n\"Where we are there aren't any women, mother,\" I say as calmly as I\r\ncan.\r\n\r\n\"And be very careful at the front, Paul.\"\r\n\r\nAh, Mother, Mother!  Why do I not take you in my arms and die with\r\nyou.  What poor wretches we are!\r\n\r\n\"Yes, mother, I will.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will pray for you every day, Paul.\"\r\n\r\nAh!  Mother, Mother!  Let us rise up and go out, back through the\r\nyears, where the burden of all this misery lies on us no more, back\r\nto you and me alone, Mother!\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you can get a job that is not so dangerous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, mother, perhaps I can get into the cook-house, that can easily\r\nbe done.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do it then, and if the others say anything----\"\r\n\r\n\"That won't worry me, mother----\"\r\n\r\nShe sighs.  Her face is a white gleam in the darkness.\r\n\r\n\"Now you must go to sleep, mother.\"\r\n\r\nShe does not reply.  I get up and wrap my cover round her shoulders.\r\n\r\nShe supports herself on my arm, she is in pain.  And so I take her to\r\nher room.  I stay with her a little while.\r\n\r\n\"And you must get well again, mother, before I come back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, my child.\"\r\n\r\n\"You ought not to send your things to me, mother.  We have plenty to\r\neat out there.  You can make much better use of them here.\"\r\n\r\nHow destitute she lies there in her bed, she, that loves me more than\r\nall the world.  As I am about to leave, she says hastily: \"I have two\r\npairs of under-pants for you.  They are all wool.  They will keep you\r\nwarm.  You must not forget to put them in your pack.\"\r\n\r\nAh!  Mother!  I know what these underpants have cost you in waiting,\r\nand walking, and begging!  Ah!  Mother, Mother! how can it be that I\r\nmust part from you?  Who else is there that has any claim on me but\r\nyou.  Here I sit and there you are lying, and we have so much to say,\r\nthat we could never say it.\r\n\r\n\"Good-night, mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-night, my child.\"\r\n\r\nThe room is dark.  I hear my mother's breathing, and the ticking of\r\nthe clock.  Outside the window the wind blows and the chestnut trees\r\nrustle.\r\n\r\nOn the landing I stumble over my pack which lies there already made\r\nup, because I have to leave early in the morning.\r\n\r\nI bite into my pillow.  I grasp the iron rods of my bed with my\r\nfists.  I ought never to have come here.  Out there I was indifferent\r\nand often hopeless;--I will never be able to be so again.  I was a\r\nsoldier, and now I am nothing but an agony for myself, for my mother,\r\nfor everything that is so comfortless and without end.\r\n\r\nI ought never to have come on leave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nI already know the camp on the moors.  It was here that Himmelstoss\r\ngave Tjaden his education.  But now I know hardly anyone here; as\r\never, all is altered.  There are only a few people that I have\r\noccasionally met before.\r\n\r\nI go through the routine mechanically.  In the evenings I generally\r\ngo to the Soldiers' Home, where the newspapers are laid out, but\r\nwhich I do not read; still, there is a piano there that I am glad\r\nenough to play on.  Two girls are in attendance, one of them is young.\r\n\r\nThe camp is surrounded with high barbed-wire fences.  If we come back\r\nlate from the Soldiers' Home we have to show passes.  But those who\r\nare on good terms with the guard can get through, of course.\r\n\r\nBetween the junipers and the birch trees on the moor we practice\r\ncompany-drill each day.  It is bearable if one expects nothing\r\nbetter.  We advance at a run, fling ourselves down, and our panting\r\nbreath moves the stalks of the grasses and the flowers of the heather\r\nto and fro.  Looked at so closely one sees the fine sand is composed\r\nof millions of the tiniest pebbles as clear as if they had been made\r\nin a laboratory. It is strangely inviting to dig one's hands into it.\r\n\r\nBut most beautiful are the woods with their line of birch trees.\r\nTheir colour changes with every minute.  Now the stems gleam purest\r\nwhite, and between them airy and silken, hangs the pastel-green of\r\nthe leaves; the next moment all changes to an opalescent blue, as the\r\nshivering breezes pass down from the heights and touch the green\r\nlightly away; and again in one place it deepens almost to black as a\r\ncloud passes over the sun.  And this shadow moves like a ghost\r\nthrough the dim trunks and passes far out over the moor to the\r\nsky--then the birches stand out again like gay banners on white\r\npoles, with their red and gold patches of autumn-tinted leaves.\r\n\r\nI often become so lost in the play of soft light and transparent\r\nshadow, that I almost fail to hear the commands.  It is when one is\r\nalone that one begins to observe Nature and to love her.  And here I\r\nhave not much companionship, and do not even desire it.  We are too\r\nlittle acquainted with one another to do more than joke a bit and\r\nplay poker or nap in the evenings.\r\n\r\nAlongside our camp is the big Russian prison camp.  It is separated\r\nfrom us by a wire fence, but in spite of this the prisoners come\r\nacross to us.  They seem nervous and fearful, though most of them are\r\nbig fellows with beards--they look like meek, scolded, St. Bernard\r\ndogs.\r\n\r\nThey slink about our camp and pick over the garbage tins.  One can\r\nimagine what they find there.  With us food is pretty scarce and none\r\ntoo good at that--turnips cut into six pieces and boiled in water,\r\nand unwashed carrot tops;--mouldy potatoes are tit-bits, and the\r\nchief luxury is a thin rice soup in which float little bits of\r\nbeef-sinew, but these are cut up so small that they take a lot of\r\nfinding.\r\n\r\nEverything gets eaten, notwithstanding, and if ever anyone is so well\r\noff as not to want all his share, there are a dozen others standing\r\nby ready to relieve him of it.  Only the dregs that the ladle cannot\r\nreach are tipped out and thrown into the garbage tins.  Along with\r\nthat sometimes go a few turnip peelings, mouldy bread crusts and all\r\nkinds of muck.\r\n\r\nThis thin, miserable, dirty garbage is the objective of the\r\nprisoners.  They pick it out of the stinking tins greedily and go off\r\nwith it under their blouses.\r\n\r\nIt is strange to see these enemies of ours so close up.  They have\r\nfaces that make one think--honest peasant faces, broad foreheads,\r\nbroad noses, broad mouths, broad hands, and thick hair.\r\n\r\nThey ought to be put to threshing, reaping, and apple picking.  They\r\nlook just as kindly as our own peasants in Friesland.\r\n\r\nIt is distressing to watch their movements, to see them begging for\r\nsomething to eat.  They are all rather feeble, for they only get\r\nenough nourishment to keep them from starving.  Ourselves we have not\r\nhad sufficient to eat for long enough.  They have dysentery;\r\nfurtively many of them display the blood-stained tails of their\r\nshirts.  Their backs, their necks are bent, their knees sag, their\r\nheads droop as they stretch out their hands and beg in the few words\r\nof German that they know--beg with those soft, deep, musical voices,\r\nthat are like warm stoves and cosy rooms at home.\r\n\r\nSome men there are who give them a kick, so that they fall over;--but\r\nthose are not many. The majority do nothing to them, just ignore them.\r\nOccasionally, when they are too grovelling, it makes a man mad and then\r\nhe kicks them. If only they would not look at one so--What great misery\r\ncan be in two such small spots, no bigger than a man's thumb--in their\r\neyes!\r\n\r\nThey come over to the camp in the evenings and trade.  They exchange\r\nwhatever they possess for bread.  Often they have fair success,\r\nbecause they have very good boots and ours are bad.  The leather of\r\ntheir knee boots is wonderfully soft, like suede.  The peasants among\r\nus who get tit bits sent from home can afford to trade.  The price of\r\na pair of boots is about two or three loaves of army bread, or a loaf\r\nof bread and a small, tough ham sausage.\r\n\r\nBut most of the Russians have long since parted with whatever things\r\nthey had.  Now they wear only the most pitiful clothing, and try to\r\nexchange little carvings and objects that they have made out of shell\r\nfragments and copper driving bands.  Of course, they don't get much\r\nfor such things, though they may have taken immense pains with\r\nthem--they go for a slice or two of bread.  Our peasants are hard and\r\ncunning when they bargain.  They hold the piece of bread or sausage\r\nright under the nose of the Russian till he grows pale with greed and\r\nhis eyes bulge and then he will give anything for it.  The peasants\r\nwrap up their booty with the utmost solemnity, and then get out their\r\nbig pocket knives, and slowly and deliberately cut off a slice of\r\nbread for themselves from their supply and with every mouthful take a\r\npiece of the good, tough sausage and so reward themselves with a good\r\nfeed.  It is distressing to watch them take their afternoon meal\r\nthus; one would like to crack them over their thick pates.  They\r\nrarely give anything away.  How little we understand one another!\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nI am often on guard over the Russians.  In the darkness one sees\r\ntheir forms move like sick storks, like great birds.  They come close\r\nup to the wire fence and lean their faces against it; their fingers\r\nhook round the mesh.  Often many stand side by side, and breathe the\r\nwind that comes down from the moors and the forest.\r\n\r\nThey rarely speak and then only a few words.  They are more human and\r\nmore brotherly towards one another, it seems to me, than we are.  But\r\nperhaps that is merely because they feel themselves to be more\r\nunfortunate than us.  Anyway the war is over so far as they are\r\nconcerned.  But to wait for dysentery is not much of a life either.\r\n\r\nThe Territorials who are in charge of them say that they were much\r\nmore lively at first.  They used to have intrigues among themselves,\r\nas always happens, and it would often come to blows and knives.  But\r\nnow they are quite apathetic, and listless; most of them do not\r\nmasturbate any more, they are so feeble, though occasionally it is so\r\nbad that they do it barracks fashion.\r\n\r\nThey stand at the wire fence; sometimes one goes away and then\r\nanother at once takes his place in the line.  Most of them are\r\nsilent; occasionally one begs a cigarette butt.\r\n\r\nI see their dark forms, their beards move in the wind.  I know\r\nnothing of them except that they are prisoners, and that is exactly\r\nwhat troubles me.  Their life is obscure and guiltless;--if I could\r\nknow more of them, what their names are, how they live, what they are\r\nwaiting for, what are their burdens, then my emotion would have an\r\nobject and might become sympathy.  But as it is I perceive behind\r\nthem only the suffering of the creature, the awful melancholy of life\r\nand the pitilessness of men.\r\n\r\nA word of command has made these silent figures our enemies; a word\r\nof command might transform them into our friends.  At some table a\r\ndocument is signed by some persons whom none of us knows, and then\r\nfor years together that very crime on which formerly the world's\r\ncondemnation and severest penalty fell, becomes our highest aim.  But\r\nwho can draw such a distinction when he looks at these quiet men with\r\ntheir childlike faces and apostles' beards.  Any non-commissioned\r\nofficer is more of an enemy to a recruit, any schoolmaster to a pupil\r\nthan they are to us.  And yet we would shoot at them again and they\r\nat us if they were free.\r\n\r\nI am frightened: I dare think this way no more.  This way lies the\r\nabyss.  It is not now the time; but I will not lose these thoughts, I\r\nwill keep them, shut them away until the war is ended.  My heart\r\nbeats fast: this is the aim, the great, the sole aim, that I have\r\nthought of in the trenches; that I have looked for as the only\r\npossibility of existence after this annihilation of all human\r\nfeeling; this is a task that will make life afterward worthy of these\r\nhideous years.\r\n\r\nI take out my cigarettes, break each one in half and give them to the\r\nRussians.  They bow to me and then they light the cigarettes.  Now\r\nred points glow in every face.  They comfort me; it looks as though\r\nthere were little windows in dark village cottages saying that behind\r\nthem are rooms full of peace.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nThe days go by.  On a foggy morning another of the Russians is\r\nburied; almost every day one of them dies.  I am on guard during the\r\nburial.  The prisoners sing a chorale, they sing in parts, and it\r\nsounds almost as if there were no voices, but an organ far away on\r\nthe moor.\r\n\r\nThe burial is quickly over.\r\n\r\nIn the evening they stand again at the wire fence and the wind comes\r\ndown to them from the beech woods.  The stars are cold.\r\n\r\nI now know a few of those who speak a little German.  There is a\r\nmusician amongst them, he says he used to be a violinist in Berlin.\r\nWhen he hears that I can play the piano he fetches his violin and\r\nplays.  The others sit down and lean their backs against the fence.\r\nHe stands up and plays, sometimes he has that absent expression which\r\nviolinists get when they close their eyes; or again he sways the\r\ninstrument to the rhythm and smiles across to me.\r\n\r\nHe plays mostly folk songs and the others hum with him.  They are\r\nlike a country of dark hills that sing far down under the ground.\r\nThe sound of the violin stands like a slender girl above it and is\r\nclear and alone.  The voices cease and the violin continues alone.\r\nIn the night it is so thin it sounds frozen; one must stand close up;\r\nit would be much better in a room;--out here it makes a man grow sad.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nBecause I have already had a long leave I get none on Sundays.  So\r\nthe last Sunday before I go back to the front my father and eldest\r\nsister come over to see me.  All day we sit in the Soldiers' Home.\r\nWhere else could we go, we don't want to stay in the camp.  About\r\nmidday we go for a walk on the moors.\r\n\r\nThe hours are a torture; we do not know what to talk about, so we\r\nspeak of my mother's illness.  It is now definitely cancer, she is\r\nalready in the hospital and will be operated on shortly.  The doctors\r\nhope she will recover, but we have never heard of cancer being cured.\r\n\r\n\"Where is she then?\" I ask.\r\n\r\n\"In the Luisa Hospital,\" says my father.\r\n\r\n\"In which class?\"\r\n\r\n\"Third.  We must wait till we know what the operation costs.  She\r\nwanted to be in the third herself.  She said that then she would have\r\nsome company.  And besides it is cheaper.\"\r\n\r\n\"So she is lying there with all those people.  If only she could\r\nsleep properly.\"\r\n\r\nMy father nods.  His face is broken and full of furrows.  My mother\r\nhas always been sickly; and though she has only gone to the hospital\r\nwhen she has been compelled to, it has cost a great deal of money,\r\nand my father's life has been practically given up to it.\r\n\r\n\"If only I knew how much the operation costs,\" says he.\r\n\r\n\"Have you not asked?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not directly, I cannot do that--the surgeon might take it amiss and\r\nthat would not do, he must operate on mother.\"\r\n\r\nYes, I think bitterly, that's how it is with us, and with all poor\r\npeople.  They don't dare to ask the price, but worry themselves\r\ndreadfully beforehand about it; but the others, for whom it is not\r\nimportant, they settle the price first as a matter of course.  And\r\nthe doctor does not take it amiss from them.\r\n\r\n\"And the dressings afterwards are so expensive,\" says my father.\r\n\r\n\"Doesn't the Invalid's Fund pay anything toward it, then?\" I ask.\r\n\r\n\"Mother has been ill too long.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you any money at all?\"\r\n\r\nHe shakes his head: \"No, but I can do some overtime.\"\r\n\r\nI know.  He will stand at his desk folding and pasting and cutting\r\nuntil twelve o'clock at night.  At eight o'clock in the evening he\r\nwill eat some of the miserable rubbish they get in exchange for their\r\nfood tickets, then he will take a powder for his headache and work on.\r\n\r\nIn order to cheer him up a bit I tell him a few stories, soldiers'\r\njokes, and the like, about generals and sergeant-majors.\r\n\r\nAfterwards I accompany them both to the railway station.  They give\r\nme a pot of jam and a bag of potato-cakes that my mother has made for\r\nme.\r\n\r\nThen they go off and I return to the camp.\r\n\r\nIn the evening I spread the jam on the cakes and eat some.  But I\r\nhave no taste for them.  So I go out to give them to the Russians.\r\nThen it occurs to me that my mother cooked them herself and that she\r\nwas probably in pain as she stood before the hot stove.  I put the\r\nbag back in my pack and take only two cakes to the Russians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nWe travel for several days.  The first aeroplanes appear in the sky.\r\nWe roll on past transport lines.  Guns, guns.  The light railway\r\npicks us up.  I search for my regiment.  No one knows exactly where\r\nit lies.  Somewhere or other I put up for the night, somewhere or\r\nother I receive provisions and a few vague instructions.  And so with\r\nmy pack and my rifle I set out again on the way.\r\n\r\nBy the time I come up they are no longer in that devastated place.  I\r\nhear we have become one of the flying divisions that are pushed in\r\nwherever it is hottest.  That does not sound cheerful to me.  They\r\ntell me of heavy losses that we have been having.  I inquire after\r\nKat and Albert.  No one knows anything of them.\r\n\r\nI search farther and wander about here and there; it is a wonderful\r\nfeeling.  One night and then another I camp out like a Red Indian.\r\nThen at last I get some definite information, and by the afternoon I\r\nam able to report to the Orderly Room.\r\n\r\nThe sergeant-major detains me there.  The company comes back in two\r\ndays' time.  There is no object in sending me up now.\r\n\r\n\"What was it like on leave?\" he asks, \"pretty good, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"In parts,\" I say.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he sighs, \"yes, if a man didn't have to come away again.  The\r\nsecond half is always rather messed up by that.\"\r\n\r\nI loaf around until the company comes back in the early morning,\r\ngrey, dirty, soured, and gloomy.  Then I jump up, push in amongst\r\nthem, my eyes searching.  There is Tjaden, there is Müller blowing\r\nhis nose, and there are Kat and Kropp.  We arrange our sacks of straw\r\nside by side.  I have an uneasy conscience when I look at them, and\r\nyet without any good reason.  Before we turn in I bring out the rest\r\nof the potato-cakes and jam so that they can have some too.\r\n\r\nThe two outer cakes are mouldy, still it is possible to eat them.  I\r\nkeep those for myself and give the fresh ones to Kat and Kropp.\r\n\r\nKat chews and says: \"These are from your mother?\"\r\n\r\nI nod.\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" says he, \"I can tell by the taste.\"\r\n\r\nI could almost weep.  I can hardly control myself any longer.  But it\r\nwill soon be all right again back here with Kat and Albert.  This is\r\nwhere I belong.\r\n\r\n\"You've been lucky,\" whispers Kropp to me before we drop off to\r\nsleep, \"they say we are going to Russia.\"\r\n\r\nTo Russia.  It's not much of a war over there.\r\n\r\nIn the distance the front thunders.  The walls of the hut rattle.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nThere's a great deal of polishing being done.  We are inspected at\r\nevery turn.  Everything that is torn is exchanged for new.  I score a\r\nspotless new tunic out of it and Kat, of course, an entire outfit.  A\r\nrumour is going round that there may be peace, but the other story is\r\nmore likely--that we are bound for Russia.  Still, what do we need\r\nnew things for in Russia?  At last it leaks out--the Kaiser is coming\r\nto review us.  Hence all the inspections.\r\n\r\nFor eight whole days one would suppose we were in a base-camp, there\r\nis so much drill and fuss.  Everyone is peevish and touchy, we do not\r\ntake kindly to all this polishing, much less to parades.  Such things\r\nexasperate a soldier more than the front-line.\r\n\r\nAt last the moment arrives.  We stand up stiff and the Kaiser\r\nappears.  We are curious to see what he looks like.  He stalks along\r\nthe line, and I am really rather disappointed; judging from his\r\npictures I imagined him to be bigger and more powerfully built, and\r\nabove all to have a thundering voice.\r\n\r\nHe distributes Iron Crosses and speaks to this man and to that.  Then\r\nwe march off.\r\n\r\nAfterwards we discuss it.  Tjaden says with astonishment:\r\n\r\n\"So that is the All-Highest!  And everyone, bar nobody, has to stand\r\nup stiff in front of him!\"  He meditates: \"Hindenburg too, he has to\r\nstand up stiff to him, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" says Kat.\r\n\r\nTjaden hasn't finished yet.  He thinks for a while and then asks:\r\n\"And would a king have to stand up stiff to an emperor?\"\r\n\r\nNone of us is quite sure about it, but we don't suppose so.  They are\r\nboth so exalted that standing strictly to attention is probably not\r\ninsisted on.\r\n\r\n\"What rot you do hatch out,\" says Kat.  \"The main point is that you\r\nhave to stand stiff yourself.\"\r\n\r\nBut Tjaden is quite fascinated.  His otherwise prosy fancy is blowing\r\nbubbles.  \"But look,\" he announces, \"I simply can't believe that an\r\nemperor has to go to the latrine the same as I have.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can bet your boots on it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Four and a half-wit make seven,\" says Kat.  \"You've got a maggot in\r\nyour brain, Tjaden, just you run along to the latrine quick, and get\r\nyour head clear, so that you don't talk like a two-year-old.\"\r\n\r\nTjaden disappears.\r\n\r\n\"But what I would like to know,\" says Albert, \"is whether there would\r\nnot have been a war if the Kaiser had said No.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure of this much,\" I interject, \"he was against it from the\r\nfirst.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if not him alone, then perhaps if twenty or thirty people in\r\nthe world had said No.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's probable,\" I agree, \"but they damned well said Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's queer, when one thinks about it,\" goes on Kropp, \"we are here\r\nto protect our fatherland.  And the French are over there to protect\r\ntheir fatherland.  Now, who's in the right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps both,\" say I, without believing it.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, well now,\" pursues Albert, and I see that he means to drive me\r\ninto a corner, \"but our professors and parsons and newspapers say\r\nthat we are the only ones that are right, and let's hope so;--but the\r\nFrench professors and parsons and newspapers say that the right is on\r\ntheir side, now what about that?\"\r\n\r\n\"That I don't know,\" I say, \"but whichever way it is there's war all\r\nthe same and every month more countries coming in.\"\r\n\r\nTjaden reappears.  He is still quite excited and again joins the\r\nconversation, wondering just how a war gets started.\r\n\r\n\"Mostly by one country badly offending another,\" answers Albert with\r\na slight air of superiority.\r\n\r\nThen Tjaden pretends to be obtuse.  \"A country?  I don't follow.  A\r\nmountain in Germany cannot offend a mountain in France.  Or a river,\r\nor a wood, or a field of wheat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you really as stupid as that, or are you just pulling my leg?\"\r\ngrowls Kropp, \"I don't mean that at all.  One people offends the\r\nother----\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I haven't any business here at all,\" replies Tjaden, \"I don't\r\nfeel myself offended.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, let me tell you,\" says Albert sourly, \"it doesn't apply to\r\ntramps like you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I can be going home right away,\" retorts Tjaden, and we all\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\"Ach, man! he means the people as a whole, the State----\" exclaims\r\nMüller.\r\n\r\n\"State, State\"--Tjaden snaps his fingers contemptuously, \"Gendarmes,\r\npolice, taxes, that's your State;--if that's what you are talking\r\nabout, no thank you.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" says Kat, \"you've said something for once, Tjaden.\r\nState and home-country, there's a big difference.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they go together,\" insists Kropp, \"without the State there\r\nwouldn't be any home-country.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, but just you consider, almost all of us are simple folk.  And\r\nin France, too, the majority of men are labourers, workmen, or poor\r\nclerks.  Now just why would a French blacksmith or a French shoemaker\r\nwant to attack us?  No, it is merely the rulers.  I had never seen a\r\nFrenchman before I came here, and it will be just the same with the\r\nmajority of Frenchmen as regards us.  They weren't asked about it any\r\nmore than we were.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what exactly is the war for?\" asks Tjaden.\r\n\r\nKat shrugs his shoulders.  \"There must be some people to whom the war\r\nis useful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm not one of them,\" grins Tjaden.\r\n\r\n\"Not you, nor anybody else here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are they then?\" persists Tjaden.  \"It isn't any use to the\r\nKaiser either.  He has everything he can want already.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not so sure about that,\" contradicts Kat, \"he has not had a war\r\nup till now.  And every full-grown emperor requires at least one war,\r\notherwise he wouldn't become famous.  You look in your school books.\"\r\n\r\n\"And generals too,\" adds Detering, \"they become famous through war.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even more famous than emperors,\" adds Kat.\r\n\r\n\"There are other people back behind there who profit by the war,\r\nthat's certain,\" growls Detering.\r\n\r\n\"I think it is more a kind of fever,\" says Albert.  \"No one in\r\nparticular wants it, and then all at once there it is.  We didn't\r\nwant the war, the others say the same thing--and yet half the world\r\nis in it all the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there are more lies told by the other side than by us,\" say I;\r\n\"just think of those pamphlets the prisoners have on them, where it\r\nsays that we eat Belgian children.  The fellows who write that ought\r\nto go and hang themselves.  They are the real culprits.\"\r\n\r\nMüller gets up.  \"Anyway, it is better that the war is here instead\r\nof in Germany.  Just you take a look at the shell-holes.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" assents Tjaden, \"but no war at all would be better still.\"\r\n\r\nHe is quite proud of himself because he has for once scored over us\r\nvolunteers.  And his opinion is quite typical here, one meets it time\r\nand again, and there is nothing with which one can properly counter\r\nit, because that is the limit of their comprehension of the factors\r\ninvolved.  The national feeling of the tommy resolves itself into\r\nthis--here he is.  But that is the end of it; everything else from\r\njoining up onwards he criticizes from a practical point of view.\r\n\r\nAlbert lies down on the grass and growls angrily: \"The best thing is\r\nnot to talk about the rotten business.\"\r\n\r\n\"It won't make any difference, that's sure,\" agrees Kat.\r\n\r\nAs for the windfall, we have to return almost all the new things and\r\ntake back our old rags again.  The good ones were merely for the\r\ninspection.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nInstead of going to Russia, we go up the line again.  On the way we\r\npass through a devastated wood with the tree trunks shattered and the\r\nground ploughed up.\r\n\r\nAt several places there are tremendous craters.  \"Great guns,\r\nsomething's hit that,\" I say to Kat.\r\n\r\n\"Trench mortars,\" he replies, and then points up at one of the trees.\r\n\r\nIn the branches dead men are hanging.  A naked soldier is squatting\r\nin the fork of a tree, he still has his helmet on, otherwise he is\r\nentirely unclad.  There is only half of him sitting up there, the top\r\nhalf, the legs are missing.\r\n\r\n\"What can that mean?\" I ask.\r\n\r\n\"He's been blown out of his clothes,\" mutters Tjaden.\r\n\r\n\"It's funny,\" says Kat, \"we have seen that a couple of times now.  If\r\na mortar gets you it blows you almost clean out of your clothes.\r\nIt's the concussion that does it.\"\r\n\r\nI search around.  And so it is.  Here hang bits of uniform, and\r\nsomewhere else is plastered a bloody mess that was once a human limb.\r\nOver there lies a body with nothing but a piece of the underpants on\r\none leg and the collar of the tunic around its neck.  Otherwise it is\r\nnaked and the clothes are hanging up in the tree.  Both arms are\r\nmissing as though they had been pulled out.  I discover one of them\r\ntwenty yards off in a shrub.\r\n\r\nThe dead man lies on his face.  There, where the arm wounds are, the\r\nearth is black with blood.  Underfoot the leaves are scratched up as\r\nthough the man had been kicking.\r\n\r\n\"That's no joke, Kat,\" say I.\r\n\r\n\"No more is a shell splinter in the belly,\" he replies, shrugging his\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\n\"But don't get tender-hearted,\" says Tjaden.\r\n\r\nAll this can only have happened a little while ago, the blood is\r\nstill fresh.  As everybody we see there is dead we do not waste any\r\nmore time, but report the affair at the next stretcher-bearers' post.\r\nAfter all it is not our business to take these stretcher-bearers'\r\njobs away from them.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nA patrol has to be sent out to discover just how far the enemy\r\nposition is advanced.  Since my leave I feel a certain strange\r\nattachment to the other fellows, and so I volunteer to go with them.\r\nWe agree on a plan, slip out through the wire and then divide and\r\ncreep forward separately.  After a while I find a shallow shell-hole\r\nand crawl into it.  From here I peer forward.\r\n\r\nThere is moderate machine-gun fire.  It sweeps across from all\r\ndirections, not very heavy, but always sufficient to make one keep\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nA parachute star-shell opens out.  The ground lies stark in the pale\r\nlight, and then the darkness shuts down again blacker than ever.  In\r\nthe trenches we were told there were black troops in front of us.\r\nThat is nasty, it is hard to see them; they are very good at\r\npatrolling, too.  And oddly enough they are often quite stupid; for\r\ninstance, both Kat and Kropp were once able to shoot down a black\r\nenemy patrol because the fellows in their enthusiasm for cigarettes\r\nsmoked while they were creeping about.  Kat and Albert had simply to\r\naim at the glowing ends of the cigarettes.\r\n\r\nA bomb or something lands close beside me.  I have not heard it\r\ncoming and am terrified.  At the same moment a senseless fear takes\r\nhold on me.  Here I am alone and almost helpless in the\r\ndark--perhaps two other eyes have been watching me for a long while\r\nfrom another shell-hole in front of me, and a bomb lies ready to blow\r\nme to pieces.  I try to pull myself together.  It is not my first\r\npatrol and not a particularly risky one.  But it is the first since\r\nmy leave, and besides, the lie of the land is still rather strange to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nI tell myself that my alarm is absurd, that there is probably nothing\r\nat all there in the darkness watching me, because otherwise the\r\nmissile would not have landed so flat.\r\n\r\nIt is in vain.  In whirling confusion my thoughts hum in my brain--I\r\nhear the warning voice of my mother, I see the Russians with the\r\nflowing beards leaning against the wire fence, I have a bright\r\npicture of a canteen with stools, of a cinema in Valenciennes;\r\ntormented, terrified, in my imagination I see the grey, impalpable\r\nmuzzle of a rifle which moves noiselessly before me whichever way I\r\ntry to turn my head.  The sweat breaks out from every pore.\r\n\r\nI still continue to lie in my shallow bowl.  I look at the time; only\r\na few minutes have passed.  My forehead is wet, the sockets of my\r\neyes are damp, my hands tremble, and I am panting softly.  It is\r\nnothing but an awful spasm of fear, a simple animal fear of poking\r\nout my head and crawling on farther.\r\n\r\nAll my efforts subside like froth into the one desire to be able just\r\nto stay lying there.  My limbs are glued to the earth.  I make a vain\r\nattempt;--they refuse to come away.  I press myself down on the\r\nearth, I cannot go forward, I make up my mind to stay lying there.\r\n\r\nBut immediately the wave floods over me anew, a mingled sense of\r\nshame, of remorse, and yet at the same time of security.  I raise\r\nmyself up a little to take a look around.\r\n\r\nMy eyes burn with staring into the dark.  A star-shell goes up;--I\r\nduck down again.\r\n\r\nI wage a wild and senseless fight, I want to get out of the hollow\r\nand yet slide back into it again, I say \"You must, it is your\r\ncomrades, it is not any idiotic command,\" and again: \"What does it\r\nmatter to me, I have only one life to lose----\"\r\n\r\nThat is the result of all this leave, I reproach myself bitterly.\r\nBut I cannot convince myself, I become terribly faint.  I raise\r\nmyself slowly and reach forward with my arms, dragging my body after\r\nme and then lie on the edge of the shell-hole, half in and half out.\r\n\r\nThere I hear sounds and drop back.  Suspicious sounds can be detected\r\nclearly despite the noise of the artillery-fire.  I listen; the sound\r\nis behind me.  They are our people moving along the trench.  Now I\r\nhear muffled voices.  To judge by the tone that might be Kat talking.\r\n\r\nAt once a new warmth flows through me.  These voices, these few quiet\r\nwords, these footsteps in the trench behind me recall me at a bound\r\nfrom the terrible loneliness and fear of death by which I had been\r\nalmost destroyed.  They are more to me than life, these voices, they\r\nare more than motherliness and more than fear; they are the\r\nstrongest, most comforting thing there is anywhere: they are the\r\nvoices of my comrades.\r\n\r\nI am no longer a shuddering speck of existence, alone in the\r\ndarkness;--I belong to them and they to me, we all share the same\r\nfear and the same life, we are nearer than lovers, in a simpler, a\r\nharder way; I could bury my face in them, in these voices, these\r\nwords that have saved me and will stand by me.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nCautiously I glide out over the edge and snake my way forward.  I\r\nshuffle along on all fours a bit farther, I keep track of my\r\nbearings, look around me and observe the distribution of the gunfire\r\nso as to be able to find my way back.  Then I try to get in touch\r\nwith the others.\r\n\r\nI am still afraid, but it is an intelligent fear, an extraordinarily\r\nheightened caution.  The night is windy and shadows flit hither and\r\nthither in the flicker of the gunfire.  It reveals too little and too\r\nmuch.  Often I peer ahead, but always for nothing.  Thus I advance a\r\nlong way and then turn back in a wide curve.  I have not established\r\ntouch with the others.  Every yard nearer our trench fills me with\r\nconfidence;--and with haste, too.  It would be bad to get lost now.\r\n\r\nThen a new fear lays hold of me.  I can no longer remember the\r\ndirection.  Quiet, I squat in a shell-hole and try to locate myself.\r\nMore than once it has happened that some fellow has jumped joyfully\r\ninto a trench only then to discover that it was the wrong one.\r\n\r\nAfter a little time I listen again, but still I am not sure.  The\r\nconfusion of shell-holes now seems so bewildering that I can no\r\nlonger tell in my agitation which way I should go.  Perhaps I am\r\ncrawling parallel to the lines, and that might go on for ever.  So I\r\ncrawl round once again in a wide curve.\r\n\r\nThese damned rockets!  They seem to burn for an hour, and a man\r\ncannot make the least movement without bringing the bullets whistling\r\nround.\r\n\r\nBut there is nothing for it, I must get out.  Falteringly I work my\r\nway farther, I move off over the ground like a crab and rip my hands\r\nsorely on the jagged splinters, as sharp as razor blades.  Often I\r\nthink that the sky is becoming lighter on the horizon, but it may be\r\nmerely my imagination.  Then gradually I realize that to crawl in the\r\nright direction is a matter of life or death.\r\n\r\nA shell crashes.  Almost immediately two others.  And then it begins\r\nin earnest.  A bombardment.  Machine-guns rattle.  Now there is\r\nnothing for it but to stay lying low.  Apparently an attack is\r\ncoming.  Everywhere the rockets shoot up.  Unceasing.\r\n\r\nI lie huddled in a large shell-hole, my legs in the water up to the\r\nbelly.  When the attack starts I will let myself fall into the water,\r\nwith my face as deep in the mud as I can keep it without suffocating.\r\nI must pretend to be dead.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I hear the barrage lift.  At once I slip down into the\r\nwater, my helmet on the nape of my neck and my mouth just clear so\r\nthat I can get a breath of air.\r\n\r\nI lie motionless;--somewhere something clanks, it stamps and stumbles\r\nnearer--all my nerves become taut and icy.  It clatters over me and\r\naway, the first wave has passed.  I have but this one shattering\r\nthought: What will you do if someone jumps into your shell-hole?--\r\nSwiftly I pull out my little dagger, grasp it fast and bury it in my\r\nhand once again under the mud.  If anyone jumps in here I will go for\r\nhim.  It hammers in my forehead; at once, stab him clean through the\r\nthroat, so that he cannot call out; that's the only way; he will be\r\njust as frightened as I am, when in terror we fall upon one another,\r\nthen I must be first.\r\n\r\nNow our batteries are firing.  A shell lands near me.  That makes me\r\nsavage with fury, all it needs now is to be killed by our own shells;\r\nI curse and grind my teeth in the mud; it is a raving frenzy; in the\r\nend all I can do is groan and pray.\r\n\r\nThe crash of the shells bursts in my ears.  If our fellows make a\r\ncounter-raid I will be saved.  I press my head against the earth and\r\nlisten to the muffled thunder, like the explosions of quarrying--and\r\nraise it again to listen for the sounds on top.\r\n\r\nThe machine-guns rattle.  I know our barbed wire entanglements are\r\nstrong and almost undamaged;--parts of them are charged with a\r\npowerful electric current.  The rifle fire increases.  They have not\r\nbroken through; they have to retreat.\r\n\r\nI sink down again, huddled, strained to the uttermost.  The banging,\r\nthe creeping, the clanging becomes audible.  One single cry yelling\r\namongst it all.  They are raked with fire, the attack is repulsed.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nAlready it has become somewhat lighter.  Steps hasten over me.  The\r\nfirst.  Gone.  Again, another.  The rattle of machine-guns becomes an\r\nunbroken chain.  Just as I am about to turn round a little, something\r\nheavy stumbles, and with a crash a body falls over me into the\r\nshell-hole, slips down, and lies across me----\r\n\r\nI do not think at all, I make no decision--I strike madly home, and\r\nfeel only how the body suddenly convulses, then becomes limp, and\r\ncollapses.  When I recover myself, my hand is sticky and wet.\r\n\r\nThe man gurgles.  It sounds to me as though he bellows, every gasping\r\nbreath is like a cry, a thunder--but it is only my heart pounding.  I\r\nwant to stop his mouth, stuff it with earth, stab him again, he must\r\nbe quiet, he is betraying me; now at last I regain control of myself,\r\nbut have suddenly become so feeble that I cannot any more lift my\r\nhand against him.\r\n\r\nSo I crawl away to the farthest corner and stay there, my eyes glued\r\non him, my hand grasping the knife--ready, if he stirs, to spring at\r\nhim again.  But he won't do so any more, I can hear that already in\r\nhis gurgling.\r\n\r\nI can see him indistinctly.  I have but one desire, to get away.  If\r\nit is not soon it will be too light; it will be difficult enough now.\r\nThen as I try to raise up my head I see it is impossible already.\r\nThe machine-gun fire so sweeps the ground that I would be shot\r\nthrough and through before I could make one jump.\r\n\r\nI test it once with my helmet, which I take off and hold up to find\r\nout the level of the shots.  The next moment it is knocked out of my\r\nhand by a bullet.  The fire is sweeping very low over the ground.  I\r\nam not far enough from the enemy line to escape being picked off by\r\none of the snipers if I attempt to get away.\r\n\r\nThe light increases.  Burning I wait for our attack.  My hands are\r\nwhite at the knuckles, I clench them so tightly in my longing for the\r\nfire to cease so that my comrades may come.\r\n\r\nMinute after minute trickles away.  I dare not look again at the dark\r\nfigure in the shell-hole.  With an effort I look past it and wait,\r\nwait.  The bullets hiss, they make a steel net, never ceasing, never\r\nceasing.\r\n\r\nThen I notice my bloody hand and suddenly feel nauseated.  I take\r\nsome earth and rub the skin with it, now my hand is muddy and the\r\nblood cannot be seen any more.\r\n\r\nThe fire does not diminish.  It is equally heavy from both sides.\r\nOur fellows have probably given me up for lost long ago.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nIt is early morning, clear and grey.  The gurgling continues, I stop\r\nmy ears, but soon take my fingers away again, because then I cannot\r\nhear the other sound.\r\n\r\nThe figure opposite me moves.  I shrink together and involuntarily\r\nlook at it.  Then my eyes remain glued to it.  A man with a small\r\npointed beard lies there, his head is fallen to one side, one arm is\r\nhalf-bent, his head rests helplessly upon it.  The other hand lies on\r\nhis chest, it is bloody.\r\n\r\nHe is dead, I say to myself, he must be dead, he doesn't feel\r\nanything any more; it is only the body that is gurgling there.  Then\r\nthe head tries to raise itself, for a moment the groaning becomes\r\nlouder, his forehead sinks back upon his arm.  The man is not dead,\r\nhe is dying, but he is not dead.  I drag myself toward him, hesitate,\r\nsupport myself on my hands, creep a bit farther, wait, again a\r\nterrible journey of three yards, a long, a terrible journey.  At last\r\nI am beside him.\r\n\r\nThen he opens his eyes.  He must have heard me and gazes at me with a\r\nlook of utter terror.  The body lies still, but in the eyes there is\r\nsuch an extraordinary expression of flight that for a moment I think\r\nthey have power enough to carry the body off with them.  Hundreds of\r\nmiles away with one bound.  The body is still, perfectly still,\r\nwithout sound, the gurgle has ceased, but the eyes cry out, yell, all\r\nthe life is gathered together in them for one tremendous effort to\r\nflee, gathered together there in a dreadful terror of death, of me.\r\n\r\nMy legs give way and I drop on my elbows.  \"No, no,\" I whisper.\r\n\r\nThe eyes follow me.  I am powerless to move so long as they are there.\r\n\r\nThen his hand slips slowly from his breast, only a little bit, it\r\nsinks just a few inches, but this movement breaks the power of the\r\neyes.  I bend forward, shake my head and whisper: \"No, no, no,\" I\r\nraise one hand, I must show him that I want to help him, I stroke his\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\nThe eyes shrink back as the hand comes, then they lose their stare,\r\nthe eyelids droop lower, the tension is past.  I open his collar and\r\nplace his head more comfortably upright.\r\n\r\nHis mouth stands half open, it tries to form words.  The lips are\r\ndry.  My water bottle is not there.  I have not brought it with me.\r\nBut there is water in the mud, down at the bottom of the crater.  I\r\nclimb down, take out my handkerchief, spread it out, push it under\r\nand scoop up the yellow water that strains through into the hollow of\r\nmy hand.\r\n\r\nHe gulps it down.  I fetch some more.  Then I unbutton his tunic in\r\norder to bandage him if it is possible.  In any case I must do it, so\r\nthat if the fellows over there capture me they will see that I wanted\r\nto help him, and so will not shoot me.  He tries to resist, but his\r\nhand is too feeble.  The shirt is stuck and will not come away, it is\r\nbuttoned at the back.  So there is nothing for it but to cut it off.\r\n\r\nI look for the knife and find it again.  But when I begin to cut the\r\nshirt the eyes open once more and the cry is in them again and the\r\ndemented expression, so that I must close them, press them shut and\r\nwhisper: \"I want to help you, Comrade, camerade, camerade,\r\ncamerade----\" eagerly repeating the word, to make him understand.\r\n\r\nThere are three stabs.  My field dressing covers them, the blood runs\r\nout under it, I press it tighter; there; he groans.\r\n\r\nThat is all I can do.  Now we must wait, wait.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nThese hours....  The gurgling starts again--but how slowly a man\r\ndies!  For this I know--he cannot be saved.  Indeed, I have tried to\r\ntell myself that he will be, but at noon this pretence breaks down\r\nand melts before his groans.  If only I had not lost my revolver\r\ncrawling about, I would shoot him.  Stab him I cannot.\r\n\r\nBy noon I am groping on the outer limits of reason.  Hunger devours\r\nme, I could almost weep for something to eat, I cannot struggle\r\nagainst it.  Again and again I fetch water for the dying man and\r\ndrink some myself.\r\n\r\nThis is the first man I have killed with my hands, whom I can see\r\nclose at hand, whose death is my doing.  Kat and Kropp and Müller\r\nhave experienced it already, when they have hit someone; it happens\r\nto many, in hand-to-hand fighting especially--\r\n\r\nBut every gasp lays my heart bare.  This dying man has time with him,\r\nhe has an invisible dagger with which he stabs me: Time and my\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\nI would give much if he would but stay alive.  It is hard to lie here\r\nand to have to see and hear him.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, about three, he is dead.\r\n\r\nI breathe freely again.  But only for a short time.  Soon the silence\r\nis more unbearable than the groans.  I wish the gurgling were there\r\nagain, gasping, hoarse, now whistling softly and again hoarse and\r\nloud.\r\n\r\nIt is mad, what I do.  But I must do something.  I prop the dead man\r\nup again so that he lies comfortably although he feels nothing any\r\nmore.  I close his eyes.  They are brown, his hair is black and a bit\r\ncurly at the sides.\r\n\r\nThe mouth is full and soft beneath his moustache; the nose is\r\nslightly arched, the skin brownish; it is now not so pale as it was\r\nbefore, when he was still alive.  For a moment the face seems almost\r\nhealthy;--then it collapses suddenly into the strange face of the\r\ndead that I have so often seen, strange faces, all alike.\r\n\r\nNo doubt his wife still thinks of him; she does not know what has\r\nhappened.  He looks as if he would often have written to her;--she\r\nwill still be getting mail from him--To-morrow, in a week's\r\ntime--perhaps even a stray letter a month hence.  She will read it,\r\nand in it he will be speaking to her.\r\n\r\nMy state is getting worse, I can no longer control my thoughts.  What\r\nwould his wife look like?  Like the little brunette on the other side\r\nof the canal?  Does she belong to me now?  Perhaps by this act she\r\nbecomes mine.  I wish Kantorek were sitting here beside me.  If my\r\nmother could see me----.  The dead man might have had thirty more\r\nyears of life if only I had impressed the way back to our trench more\r\nsharply on my memory.  If only he had run two yards farther to the\r\nleft, he might now be sitting in the trench over there and writing a\r\nfresh letter to his wife.\r\n\r\nBut I will get no further that way; for that is the fate of all of\r\nus: if Kemmerich's leg had been six inches to the right; if Haie\r\nWesthus had bent his back three inches further forward----\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nThe silence spreads.  I talk and must talk.  So I speak to him and\r\nsay to him: \"Comrade, I did not want to kill you.  If you jumped in\r\nhere again, I would not do it, if you would be sensible too.  But you\r\nwere only an idea to me before, an abstraction that lived in my mind\r\nand called forth its appropriate response.  It was that abstraction I\r\nstabbed.  But now, for the first time, I see you are a man like me.\r\nI thought of your hand-grenades, of your bayonet, of your rifle; now\r\nI see your wife and your face and our fellowship.  Forgive me,\r\ncomrade.  We always see it too late.  Why do they never tell us that\r\nyou are just poor devils like us, that your mothers are just as\r\nanxious as ours, and that we have the same fear of death, and the\r\nsame dying and the same agony--.  Forgive me, comrade; how could you\r\nbe my enemy?  If we threw away these rifles and this uniform you\r\ncould be my brother just like Kat and Albert.  Take twenty years of\r\nmy life, comrade, and stand up--take more, for I do not know what I\r\ncan even attempt to do with it now.\"\r\n\r\nIt is quiet, the front is still except for the crackle of rifle fire.\r\nThe bullets rain over, they are not fired haphazard, but shrewdly\r\naimed from all sides.  I cannot get out.\r\n\r\n\"I will write to your wife,\" I say hastily to the dead man, \"I will\r\nwrite to her, she must hear it from me, I will tell her everything I\r\nhave told you, she shall not suffer, I will help her, and your\r\nparents too, and your child----\"\r\n\r\nHis tunic is half open.  The pocket-book is easy to find.  But I\r\nhesitate to open it.  In it is the book with his name.  So long as I\r\ndo not know his name perhaps I may still forget him, time will\r\nobliterate it, this picture.  But his name, it is a nail that will be\r\nhammered into me and never come out again.  It has the power to\r\nrecall this for ever, it will always come back and stand before me.\r\n\r\nIrresolutely I take the wallet in my hand.  It slips out of my hand\r\nand falls open.  Some pictures and letters drop out.  I gather them\r\nup and want to put them back again, but the strain I am under, the\r\nuncertainty, the hunger, the danger, these hours with the dead man\r\nhave confused me, I want to hasten the relief, to intensify and to\r\nend the torture, as one strikes an unendurably painful hand against\r\nthe trunk of a tree, regardless of everything.\r\n\r\nThere are portraits of a woman and a little girl, small amateur\r\nphotographs taken against an ivy-clad wall.  Along with them are\r\nletters.  I take them out and try to read them.  Most of it I do not\r\nunderstand, it is so hard to decipher and I know scarcely any French.\r\nBut each word I translate pierces me like a shot in the chest;--like\r\na stab in the chest.\r\n\r\nMy brain is taxed beyond endurance.  But I realize this much, that I\r\nwill never dare to write to these people as I intended.  Impossible.\r\nI look at the portraits once more; they are clearly not rich people.\r\nI might send them money anonymously if I earn anything later on.  I\r\nseize upon that, it is at least something to hold on to.  This dead\r\nman is bound up with my life, therefore I must do everything, promise\r\neverything, in order to save myself; I swear blindly that I mean to\r\nlive only for his sake and his family, with wet lips I try to placate\r\nhim--and deep down in me lies the hope that I may buy myself off in\r\nthis way and perhaps even yet get out of this; it is a little\r\nstratagem: if only I am allowed to escape, then I will see to it.  So\r\nI open the book and read slowly:--Gerard Duval, compositor.\r\n\r\nWith the dead man's pencil I write the address on an envelope, then\r\nswiftly thrust everything back into his tunic.\r\n\r\nI have killed the printer, Gerard Duval.  I must be a printer, I\r\nthink confusedly, be a printer, printer----\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nBy afternoon I am calmer.  My fear was groundless.  The name troubles\r\nme no more.  The madness passes.  \"Comrade,\" I say to the dead man,\r\nbut I say it calmly, \"To-day you, to-morrow me.  But if I come out of\r\nit, comrade, I will fight against this, that has struck us both down;\r\nfrom you, taken life--and from me--?  Life also.  I promise you,\r\ncomrade.  It shall never happen again.\"\r\n\r\nThe sun strikes low.  I am stupefied with exhaustion and hunger.\r\nYesterday is like a fog to me, there is no hope of getting out of\r\nthis yet.  I fall into a doze and do not at first realize that\r\nevening is approaching.  The twilight comes.  It seems to me to come\r\nquickly now.  One hour more.  If it were summer, it would be three\r\nhours more.  One hour more.\r\n\r\nNow suddenly I begin to tremble; something might happen in the\r\ninterval.  I think no more of the dead man, he is of no consequence\r\nto me now.  With one bound the lust to live flares up again and\r\neverything that has filled my thoughts goes down before it.  Now,\r\nmerely to avert any ill-luck, I babble mechanically: \"I will fulfil\r\neverything, fulfil everything I have promised you----\" but already I\r\nknow that I shall not do so.\r\n\r\nSuddenly it occurs to me that my own comrades may fire on me as I\r\ncreep up; they do not know I am coming.  I will call out as soon as I\r\ncan so that they will recognize me.  I will stay lying in front of\r\nthe trench until they answer me.\r\n\r\nThe first star.  The front remains quiet.  I breathe deeply and talk\r\nto myself in my excitement: \"No foolishness now, Paul--Quiet, Paul,\r\nquiet--then you will be saved, Paul.\"  When I use my Christian name\r\nit works as though someone else spoke to me, it has more power.\r\n\r\nThe darkness grows.  My excitement subsides, I wait cautiously until\r\nthe first rocket goes up.  Then I crawl out of the shell-hole.  I\r\nhave forgotten the dead man.  Before me lies the on-coming night and\r\nthe pale gleaming field.  I fix my eye on a shell-hole; the moment\r\nthe light dies I scurry over into it, grope farther, spring into the\r\nnext, duck down, scramble onward.\r\n\r\nI come nearer.  There, by the light of a rocket I see something move\r\nin the wire, then it stiffens and lies still.  Next time I see it\r\nagain, yes, they are men from our trench.  But I am suspicious until\r\nI recognize our helmets.  Then I call.  And immediately an answer\r\nrings out, my name: \"Paul--Paul----\"\r\n\r\nI call again in answer.  It is Kat and Albert who have come out with\r\na stretcher to look for me.\r\n\r\n\"Are you wounded?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no----\"\r\n\r\nWe drop into the trench.  I ask for something to eat and wolf it\r\ndown.  Müller gives me a cigarette.  In a few words I tell what\r\nhappened.  There is nothing new about it; it happens quite often.\r\nThe night attack is the only unusual feature of the business.  In\r\nRussia Kat once lay for two days behind the enemy lines before he\r\ncould make his way back.\r\n\r\nI do not mention the dead printer.\r\n\r\nBut by next morning I can keep it to myself no longer.  I must tell\r\nKat and Albert.  They both try to calm me.  \"You can't do anything\r\nabout it.  What else could you have done?  That is what you are here\r\nfor.\"\r\n\r\nI listen to them and feel comforted, reassured by their presence.  It\r\nwas mere drivelling nonsense that I talked out there in the\r\nshell-hole.\r\n\r\n\"Look there for instance,\" points Kat.\r\n\r\nOn the fire-step stand some snipers.  They rest their rifles with\r\ntelescopic sights on the parapet and watch the enemy front.  Once and\r\nagain a shot cracks out.\r\n\r\nThen we hear the cry: \"That's found a billet!\"  \"Did you see how he\r\nleapt in the air?\"  Sergeant Oellrich turns round proudly and scores\r\nhis point.  He heads the shooting list for to-day with three\r\nunquestionable hits.\r\n\r\n\"What do you say to that?\" asks Kat.\r\n\r\nI nod.\r\n\r\n\"If he keeps that up he will get a little coloured bird for his\r\nbuttonhole by this evening,\" says Albert.\r\n\r\n\"Or rather he will soon be made acting-sergeant-major,\" says Kat.\r\n\r\nWe look at one another.  \"I would not do it,\" I say.\r\n\r\n\"All the same,\" says Kat, \"it's very good for you to see it just now.\"\r\n\r\nSergeant Oellrich returns to the fire-step.  The muzzle of his rifle\r\nsearches to and fro.\r\n\r\n\"You don't need to lose any more sleep over your affair,\" nods Albert.\r\n\r\nAnd now I hardly understand it myself any more.\r\n\r\n\"It was only because I had to lie there with him so long,\" I say.\r\n\"After all, war is war.\"\r\n\r\nOellrich's rifle cracks out sharp and dry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nWe have dropped in for a good job.  Eight of us have to guard a\r\nvillage that has been abandoned because it is being shelled too\r\nheavily.\r\n\r\nIn particular we have to watch the supply dump as that is not yet\r\nempty.  We are supposed to provision ourselves from the same store.\r\nWe are just the right people for that;--Kat, Albert, Müller, Tjaden,\r\nDetering, our whole gang is there.  Haie is dead, though.  But we are\r\nmighty lucky all the same, all the other squads have had more\r\ncasualties than we have.\r\n\r\nWe select, as a dug-out, a reinforced concrete cellar into which\r\nsteps lead down from above.  The entrance is protected by a separate\r\nconcrete wall.\r\n\r\nNow we develop an immense industry.  This is an opportunity not only\r\nto stretch one's legs, but to stretch one's soul also.  We make the\r\nbest use of such opportunities.  The war is too desperate to allow us\r\nto be sentimental for long.  That is only possible so long as things\r\nare not going too badly.  After all, we cannot afford to be anything\r\nbut matter-of-fact.  So matter-of-fact, indeed, that I often shudder\r\nwhen a thought from the days before the war comes momentarily into my\r\nhead.  But it does not stay long.\r\n\r\nWe have to take things as lightly as we can, so we make the most of\r\nevery opportunity, and nonsense stands stark and immediate beside\r\nhorror.  It cannot be otherwise, that is how we hearten ourselves.\r\nSo we zealously set to work to create an idyll--an idyll of eating\r\nand sleeping, of course.\r\n\r\nThe floor is first covered with mattresses which we haul in from the\r\nhouses.  Even a soldier's behind likes to sit soft.  Only in the\r\nmiddle of the floor is there any clear space.  Then we furnish\r\nourselves with blankets and eiderdowns, luxurious soft affairs.\r\nThere is plenty of everything to be had in the town.  Albert and I\r\nfind a mahogany bed which can be taken to pieces, with a sky of blue\r\nsilk and a lace coverlet.  We sweat like monkeys moving it in, but a\r\nman cannot let a thing like that slip, and it would certainly be shot\r\nto pieces in a day or two.\r\n\r\nKat and I do a little patrolling through the houses.  In very short\r\ntime we have collected a dozen eggs and two pounds of fairly fresh\r\nbutter.  Suddenly there is a crash in the drawing room, and an iron\r\nstove hurtles through the wall past us and on, a yard from us out\r\nthrough the wall behind.  Two holes.  It comes from the house\r\nopposite where a shell has just landed.  \"The swine,\" grimaces Kat,\r\nand we continue our search.  All at once we prick up our ears, hurry\r\nacross, and suddenly stand petrified--there running up and down in a\r\nlittle sty are two live sucking pigs.  We rub our eyes and look once\r\nagain to make certain.  Yes, they are still there.  We seize hold of\r\nthem--no doubt about it, two real young pigs.\r\n\r\nThis will make a grand feed.  About twenty yards from our dug-out\r\nthere is a small house that was used as an officers' billet.  In the\r\nkitchen is an immense fireplace with two ranges, pots, pans, and\r\nkettles--everything, even to a stack of small chopped wood in an\r\nouthouse--a regular cook's paradise.\r\n\r\nTwo of our fellows have been out in the fields all the morning\r\nhunting for potatoes, carrots, and green peas.  We are quite uppish\r\nand sniff at the tinned stuff in the supply dump, we want fresh\r\nvegetables.  In the dining-room there are already two heads of\r\ncauliflower.\r\n\r\nThe sucking pigs are slaughtered.  Kat sees to them.  We want to make\r\npotato cakes to go with the roast.  But we cannot find a grater for\r\nthe potatoes.  However, that difficulty is soon got over.  With a\r\nnail we punch a lot of holes in a pot lid and there we have a grater.\r\nThree fellows put on thick gloves to protect their fingers against\r\nthe grater, two others peel the potatoes, and the business gets going.\r\n\r\nKat takes charge of the sucking pigs, the carrots, the peas, and the\r\ncauliflower.  He even mixes a white sauce for the cauliflower.  I fry\r\nthe pancakes, four at a time.  After ten minutes I get the knack of\r\ntossing the pan so that the pancakes which are done on the one side\r\nsail up, turn in the air and are caught again as they come down.  The\r\nsucking pigs are baked whole.  We all stand round them as before an\r\naltar.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime we receive visitors, a couple of wireless-men, who\r\nare generously invited to the feed.  They sit in the living-room\r\nwhere there is a piano.  One of them plays, the other sings 'An der\r\nWeser.'  He sings feelingly, but with a rather Saxon accent.  All the\r\nsame it moves us as we stand at the fireplace preparing the good\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nThen we begin to realize that we are in for trouble.  The observation\r\nballoons have spotted the smoke from our chimney, and the shells\r\nstart to drop on us.  They are those damned spraying little\r\ndaisy-cutters that make only a small hole and scatter widely close to\r\nthe ground.  They keep dropping closer and closer all round us; still\r\nwe cannot leave the grub in the lurch.  A couple of splinters whizz\r\nthrough the top of the kitchen window.  The roast is already cooked.\r\nBut frying the pancakes is getting difficult.  The explosions come so\r\nfast that the splinters strike often and oftener against the wall of\r\nthe house and sweep in through the window.  Whenever I hear a shell\r\ncoming I drop down on one knee with the pan and the pancakes, and\r\nduck behind the wall of the window.  Immediately afterwards I am up\r\nagain and going on with the frying.\r\n\r\nThe Saxons stop singing--a fragment has smashed into the piano.  At\r\nlast everything is ready and we organize the transport of it back to\r\nthe dug-out.  After the next explosion two men dash across the fifty\r\nyards to the dug-out with the pots of vegetables.  We see them\r\ndisappear.\r\n\r\nThe next shot.  Everyone ducks and then two more trot off, each with\r\na big can of finest grade coffee, and reach the dug-out before the\r\nnext explosion.\r\n\r\nThen Kat and Kropp seize the masterpiece--the big dish with the\r\nbrown, roasted sucking pigs.  A screech, a knee bend, and away they\r\nrace over the fifty yards of open country.\r\n\r\nI stay to finish frying my last four pancakes; twice I have to drop\r\non the floor;--after all, it means four pancakes more, and they are\r\nmy favourite dish.\r\n\r\nThen I grab the plate with the great pile of cakes and squeeze myself\r\nbehind the house door.  A hiss, a crash, and I gallop off with the\r\nplate clamped against my chest with both hands.  I am almost in, I\r\nrun like a deer, sweep round the wall, fragments clatter against the\r\nconcrete, I tumble down the cellar steps, my elbows are skinned, but\r\nI have not lost a single pancake, nor even broken the plate.\r\n\r\nAbout two o'clock we start the meal.  It lasts till six.  We drink\r\ncoffee until half-past seven--officers' coffee from the supply\r\ndump--and smoke officers' cigars and cigarettes--also from the supply\r\ndump.  Punctually at half-past seven we begin the evening meal.\r\nAbout ten o'clock we throw the bones of the sucking pigs outside the\r\ndoor.  Then there is cognac and rum--also from the blessed supply\r\ndump--and once again long, fat cigars with belly-bands.  Tjaden\r\nsuggests that it lacks only one thing: Girls from an officers'\r\nbrothel.\r\n\r\nLate in the evening we hear mewing.  A little grey cat sits in the\r\nentrance.  We entice it in and give it something to eat.  And that\r\nwakes up our own appetites once more.  Still chewing, we lie down to\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nBut the night is bad.  We have eaten too much fat.  Fresh baby pig is\r\nvery griping to the bowels.  There is an everlasting coming and going\r\nin the dug-out.  Two, three men with their pants down are always\r\nsitting about outside and cursing.  I have been out nine times\r\nmyself.  About four o'clock in the morning we reach a record: all\r\neleven men, guards and visitors, are squatting outside.\r\n\r\nBurning houses stand out like torches against the night.  Shells\r\nlumber across and crash down.  Munition columns tear along the\r\nstreet.  On one side the supply dump has been ripped open.  In spite\r\nof all the flying fragments the drivers of the munition columns pour\r\nin like a swarm of bees and pounce on the bread.  We let them have\r\ntheir own way.  If we said anything it would only mean a good hiding\r\nfor us.  So we go differently about it.  We explain that we are the\r\nguard and so know our way about, we get hold of the tinned stuff and\r\nexchange it for things we are short of.  What does it matter\r\nanyhow--in a while it will all be blown to pieces.  For ourselves we\r\ntake some chocolate from the depot and eat it in slabs.  Kat says it\r\nis good for loose bowels.\r\n\r\nAlmost a fortnight passes thus in eating, drinking, and roaming\r\nabout.  No one disturbs us.  The town gradually vanishes under the\r\nshells and we lead a charmed life.  So long as any part of the supply\r\ndump still stands we don't worry, we desire nothing better than to\r\nstay here till the end of the war.\r\n\r\nTjaden has become so fastidious that he only half smokes his cigars.\r\nWith his nose in the air he explains to us that he was brought up\r\nthat way.  And Kat is most cheerful.  In the morning his first call\r\nis: \"Emil, bring in the caviare and coffee.\"  We put on extraordinary\r\nairs, every man treats the other as his valet, bounces him and gives\r\nhim orders.  \"There is something itching under my foot; Kropp, my\r\nman, catch that louse at once,\" says Leer, poking out his leg at him\r\nlike a ballet girl, and Albert drags him up the stairs by the foot.\r\n\"Tjaden!\"--\"What?\"--\"Stand at ease, Tjaden; and what's more, don't\r\nsay 'What,' say 'Yes, Sir,'--now: Tjaden!\"  Tjaden retorts in the\r\nwell-known phrase from Goethe's \"Götz von Berlichingen,\" with which\r\nhe is always very free.\r\n\r\nAfter eight more days we receive orders to go back.  The palmy days\r\nare over.  Two big motor lorries take us away.  They are stacked high\r\nwith planks.  Nevertheless, Albert and I erect on top our four-poster\r\nbed complete with blue silk canopy, mattress, and two lace coverlets.\r\nAnd behind it at the head is stowed a bag full of choice edibles.  We\r\noften dip into it, and the tough ham sausages, the tins of liver\r\nsausages, the conserves, the boxes of cigarettes rejoice our hearts.\r\nEach man has a bag to himself.\r\n\r\nKropp and I have rescued two big red armchairs as well.  They stand\r\ninside the bed, and we sprawl back in them as in a theatre box.\r\nAbove us swells the silken cover like a baldaquin.  Each man has a\r\nlong cigar in his mouth.  And thus from aloft we survey the scene.\r\n\r\nBetween us stands a parrot-cage that we found for the cat.  She is\r\ncoming with us, and lies in the cage before her saucer of meat, and\r\npurrs.\r\n\r\nSlowly the lorries roll down the road.  We sing.  Behind us the\r\nshells are sending up fountains from the now utterly abandoned town.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nA few days later we are sent out to evacuate a village.  On the way\r\nwe meet the fleeing inhabitants trundling their goods and chattels\r\nalong with them in wheel-barrows, perambulators, and on their backs.\r\nTheir figures are bent, their faces full of grief, despair, haste,\r\nand resignation.  The children hold on to their mothers' hands, and\r\noften an older girl leads the little ones who stumble onward and are\r\nfor ever looking back.  A few carry miserable-looking dolls.  All are\r\nsilent as they pass us by.\r\n\r\nWe are marching in column; the French do not fire on a town in which\r\nthere are still inhabitants.  But a few minutes later the air\r\nscreams, the earth heaves, cries ring out; a shell has landed among\r\nthe rear squad.  We scatter and fling ourselves down on the ground,\r\nbut at that moment I feel the instinctive alertness leave me which\r\nhitherto has always made me do unconsciously the right thing under\r\nfire; the thought leaps up with a terrible, throttling fear: \"You are\r\nlost\"--and the next moment a blow sweeps like a whip over my left\r\nleg.  I hear Albert cry out; he is beside me.\r\n\r\n\"Quick, up, Albert!\" I yell, for we are lying unsheltered in the open\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nHe staggers up and runs.  I keep beside him.  We have to get over a\r\nhedge; it is higher than we are.  Kropp seizes a branch, I heave him\r\nup by the leg, he cries out, I give him a swing and he flies over.\r\nWith one leap I follow him and fall into a ditch that lies behind the\r\nhedge.\r\n\r\nOur faces are smothered with duck-weed and mud, but the cover is\r\ngood.  So we wade in up to our necks.  Whenever a shell whistles we\r\nduck our heads under the water.  After we have done this a dozen\r\ntimes, I am exhausted.\r\n\r\n\"Let's get away, or I'll fall in and drown,\" groans Albert.\r\n\r\n\"Where has it got you?\" I ask him.\r\n\r\n\"In the knee, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you run?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think----\"\r\n\r\n\"Then out!\"\r\n\r\nWe make for the ditch beside the road, and stooping, run along it.\r\nThe shelling follows us.  The road leads toward the munition dump.\r\nIf that goes up there won't be a man of us with his head left on his\r\nshoulders.  So we change our plan and run diagonally across country.\r\n\r\nAlbert begins to drag.  \"You go, I'll come on after,\" he says, and\r\nthrows himself down.\r\n\r\nI seize him by the arm and shake him.  \"Up, Albert, if once you lie\r\ndown you'll never get any farther.  Quick, I'll hold you up.\"\r\n\r\nAt last we reach a small dug-out.  Kropp pitches in and I bandage him\r\nup.  The shot is just a little above his knee.  Then I take a look at\r\nmyself.  My trousers are bloody and my arm, too.  Albert binds up my\r\nwounds with his field dressing.  Already he is no longer able to move\r\nhis leg, and we both wonder how we managed to get this far.  Fear\r\nalone made it possible; we would have run even if our feet had been\r\nshot off;--we would have run on the stumps.\r\n\r\nI can still crawl a little.  I call out to a passing ambulance wagon\r\nwhich picks us up.  It is full of wounded.  There is an army medical\r\nlance-corporal with it who sticks an anti-tetanus needle into our\r\nchests.\r\n\r\nAt the dressing station we arrange matters so that we lie side by\r\nside.  They give us a thin soup which we spoon down greedily and\r\nscornfully, because we are accustomed to better times but are hungry\r\nall the same.\r\n\r\n\"Now for home, Albert,\" I say.\r\n\r\n\"Let's hope so,\" he replies, \"I only wish I knew what I've got.\"\r\n\r\nThe pain increases.  The bandages burn like fire.  We drink and\r\ndrink, one glass of water after another.\r\n\r\n\"How far above the knee am I hit?\" asks Kropp.\r\n\r\n\"At least four inches, Albert,\" I answer.  Actually it is perhaps one.\r\n\r\n\"I've made up my mind,\" he says after a while, \"if they take off my\r\nleg, I'll put an end to it.  I won't go through life as a cripple.\"\r\n\r\nSo we lie there with our thoughts and wait.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nIn the evening we are hauled on to the chopping-block.  I am\r\nfrightened and think quickly what I ought to do; for everyone knows\r\nthat the surgeons in the dressing stations amputate on the slightest\r\nprovocation.  Under the great pressure of business that is much\r\nsimpler than complicated patching.  I think of Kemmerich.  Whatever\r\nhappens I will not let them chloroform me, even if I have to crack a\r\ncouple of their skulls.\r\n\r\nIt is all right.  The surgeon pokes around in the wound and a\r\nblackness comes before my eyes.  \"Don't carry on so,\" he says\r\ngruffly, and hacks away.  The instruments gleam in the bright light\r\nlike malevolent animals.  The pain is insufferable.  Two orderlies\r\nhold my arms fast, but I break loose with one of them and try to\r\ncrash into the surgeon's spectacles just as he notices and springs\r\nback.  \"Chloroform the scoundrel,\" he roars madly.\r\n\r\nThen I become quiet.  \"Pardon me, Herr Doctor, I will keep still, but\r\ndo not chloroform me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well now,\" he cackles and takes up his instrument again.  He is a\r\nfair fellow, not more than thirty years old, with scars and\r\ndisgusting gold spectacles.  Now I see that he is tormenting me, he\r\nis merely raking about in the wound and looking up surreptitiously at\r\nme over his glasses.  My hands squeeze around the grips, I'll kick\r\nthe bucket before he will get a squeak out of me.\r\n\r\nHe has fished out a piece of shell and tosses it to me.  Apparently\r\nhe is pleased at my self-control, for he seems to be more considerate\r\nof me now and says: \"To-morrow you'll be off home.\"  Then I am put in\r\nplaster.  When I am back again with Kropp I tell him that apparently\r\na hospital train comes in to-morrow morning.\r\n\r\n\"We must work the army medical sergeant-major so that we can keep\r\ntogether, Albert.\"\r\n\r\nI manage to slip the sergeant-major two of my cigars with\r\nbelly-bands, and then tip the word to him.  He smells the cigars and\r\nsays: \"Have you got any more of them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Another good handful,\" I say, \"and my comrade,\" I point to Kropp,\r\n\"he has some as well.  We might possibly be glad to hand them to you\r\nout of the window of the hospital train in the morning.\"\r\n\r\nHe understands, of course, smells them once again and says: \"Done.\"\r\n\r\nWe cannot get a minute's sleep all night.  Seven fellows die in our\r\nward.  One of them sings hymns in a high cracked tenor before he\r\nbegins to gurgle.  Another has crept out of his bed to the window.\r\nHe lies in front of it as though he wants to look out for the last\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nOur stretchers stand on the platform.  We wait for the train.  It\r\nrains and the station has no roof.  Our covers are thin.  We have\r\nwaited already two hours.\r\n\r\nThe sergeant-major looks after us like a mother.  Although I feel\r\npretty bad I do not let our scheme out of my mind.  Occasionally I\r\nlet him see the packet and give him one cigar in advance.  In\r\nexchange the sergeant-major covers us over with a water-proof sheet.\r\n\r\n\"Albert, old man,\" I suddenly bethink myself, \"our four poster and\r\nthe cat----\"\r\n\r\n\"And the club chairs,\" he adds.\r\n\r\nYes, the club chairs with red plush.  In the evening we used to sit\r\nin them like lords, and intended later on to let them out by the\r\nhour.  One cigarette per hour.  It might have turned into a regular\r\nbusiness, a real good living.\r\n\r\n\"And our bags of grub, too, Albert.\"\r\n\r\nWe grow melancholy.  We might have made some use of the things.  If\r\nonly the train left one day later Kat would be sure to find us and\r\nbring us the stuff.\r\n\r\nWhat damned hard luck!  In our bellies there is gruel, mean hospital\r\nstuff, and in our bags roast pork.  But we are so weak that we cannot\r\nwork up any more excitement about it.\r\n\r\nThe stretchers are sopping wet by the time the train arrives in the\r\nmorning.  The sergeant-major sees to it that we are put in the same\r\ncar.  There is a crowd of red-cross nurses.  Kropp is stowed in\r\nbelow.  I am lifted up and put into the bed above him.\r\n\r\n\"Good God!\" I exclaim suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asks the sister.\r\n\r\nI cast a glance at the bed.  It is covered with clean snow-white\r\nlinen, that even has the marks of the iron still on it.  And my shirt\r\nhas gone six weeks without being washed and is terribly muddy.\r\n\r\n\"Can't you get in by yourself?\" asks the sister gently.\r\n\r\n\"Why yes,\" I say in a sweat, \"but take off the bed cover first.\"\r\n\r\n\"What for?\"\r\n\r\nI feel like a pig.  Must I get in there?--\"It will get----\"  I\r\nhesitate.\r\n\r\n\"A little bit dirty?\" she suggests helpfully.  \"That doesn't matter,\r\nwe will wash it again afterwards.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, not that----\" I say excitedly.  I am not equal to such\r\noverwhelming refinement.\r\n\r\n\"When you have been lying out there in the trenches, surely we can\r\nwash a sheet,\" she goes on.\r\n\r\nI look at her, she is young and crisp, spotless and neat, like\r\neverything here; a man cannot realize that it isn't for officers\r\nonly, and feels himself strange and in some way even alarmed.\r\n\r\nAll the same, the woman is a tormentor, she is going to force me to\r\nsay it.  \"It is only----\" I try again, surely she must know what I\r\nmean.\r\n\r\n\"What is it then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because of the lice,\" I bawl out at last.\r\n\r\nShe laughs.  \"Well, they must have a good day for once, too.\"\r\n\r\nNow I don't care any more.  I scramble into bed and pull up the\r\ncovers.\r\n\r\nA hand gropes over the bed-cover.  The sergeant-major.  He goes off\r\nwith the cigars.\r\n\r\nAn hour later we notice that we are moving.\r\n\r\nAt night I cannot sleep.  Kropp is restless too.  The train rides\r\neasily over the rails.  I cannot realize it all yet; a bed, a train,\r\nhome.  \"Albert!\" I whisper.\r\n\r\n\"Yes----\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know where the latrine is?\"\r\n\r\n\"Over to the right of the door, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to have a look.\"  It is dark, I grope for the edge of the\r\nbed and cautiously try to slide down.  But my foot finds no support,\r\nI begin to slip, the plaster leg is no help, and with a crash I lie\r\non the floor.\r\n\r\n\"Damn!\" I say.\r\n\r\n\"Have you bumped yourself?\" asks Kropp.\r\n\r\n\"You could hear that well enough for yourself,\" I growl, \"my head----\"\r\n\r\nA door opens in the rear of the car.  The sister comes with a light\r\nand looks at me.\r\n\r\n\"He has fallen out of bed----\"\r\n\r\nShe feels my pulse and smooths my forehead.  \"You haven't any fever,\r\nthough.\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"  I agree.\r\n\r\n\"Have you been dreaming then?\" she asks.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps----\" I evade.  The interrogation starts again.  She looks at\r\nme with her clear eyes, and the more wonderful and sweet she is the\r\nless am I able to tell her what I want.\r\n\r\nI am lifted up into bed again.  That will be all right.  As soon as\r\nshe goes I must try to climb down again.  If she were an old woman,\r\nit might be easier to say what a man wants, but she is so very young,\r\nat the most twenty-five, it can't be done, I cannot possibly tell her.\r\n\r\nThen Albert comes to my rescue, he is not bashful, it makes no\r\ndifference to him who is upset.  He calls to the sister.  She turns\r\nround.  \"Sister, he wants----\" but no more does Albert know how to\r\nexpress it modestly and decently.  Out there we say it in a single\r\nword, but here, to such a lady----  All at once he remembers his\r\nschool days and finishes hastily: \"He wants to leave the room,\r\nsister.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" says the sister, \"but he shouldn't climb out of his bed with\r\nhis plaster bandage.  What do you want then?\" she says, turning to me.\r\n\r\nI am in mortal terror at this new turn, for I haven't any idea what\r\nthe things are called professionally.  She comes to my help.\r\n\r\n\"Little or big?\"\r\n\r\nThis shocking business!  I sweat like a pig and say shyly: \"Well,\r\nonly quite a little one----\"\r\n\r\nAt any rate, it produces the effect.\r\n\r\nI get a bottle.  After a few hours I am no longer the only one, and\r\nby morning we are quite accustomed to it and ask for what we want\r\nwithout any false modesty.\r\n\r\nThe train travels slowly.  Sometimes it halts and the dead are\r\nunloaded.  It halts often.\r\n\r\nAlbert is feverish.  I feel miserable and have a good deal of pain,\r\nbut the worst of it is that apparently there are still lice under the\r\nplaster bandage.  They itch terribly, and I cannot scratch myself.\r\n\r\nWe sleep through the days.  The country glides quietly past the\r\nwindow.  The third night we reach Herbstal.  I hear from the sister\r\nthat Albert is to be put off at the next station because of his\r\nfever.  \"How far does the train go?\" I ask.\r\n\r\n\"To Cologne.\"\r\n\r\n\"Albert,\" I say, \"we stick together; you see.\"\r\n\r\nOn the sister's next round I hold my breath and press it up into my\r\nhead.  My face swells and turns red.  She stops.  \"Are you in pain?\"\r\n\"Yes,\" I groan, \"all of a sudden.\"\r\n\r\nShe gives me a thermometer and goes on.  I would not have been under\r\nKat's tuition if I did not know what to do now.  These army\r\nthermometers are not made for old soldiers.  All one has to do is to\r\ndrive the quicksilver up and then it stays there without falling\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nI stick the thermometer under my arm at a slant, and flip it steadily\r\nwith my forefinger.  Then I give it a shake.  I send it up to 100.2°.\r\nBut that is not enough.  A match held cautiously near to it brings it\r\nup to 101.6°.\r\n\r\nAs the sister comes back, I blow myself out, breathe in short gasps,\r\ngoggle at her with vacant eyes, toss about restlessly, and mutter in\r\na whisper: \"I can't bear it any longer----\"\r\n\r\nShe notes me down on a slip of paper.  I know perfectly well my\r\nplaster bandage will not be re-opened if it can be avoided.  Albert\r\nand I are put off together.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nWe are in the same room in a Catholic Hospital.  That is a piece of\r\nluck, the Catholic infirmaries are noted for their good treatment and\r\ngood food.  The hospital has been filled up from our train, there are\r\na great many bad cases amongst them.  We do not get examined to-day\r\nbecause there are too few surgeons.  The flat trolleys with the\r\nrubber wheels pass continually along the corridor, and always with\r\nsomeone stretched at full length upon them.  A damnable position,\r\nstretched out at full length like that;--the only time it is good is\r\nwhen one is asleep.\r\n\r\nThe night is very disturbed.  No one can sleep.  Toward morning we\r\ndoze a little.  I wake up just as it grows light.  The door stands\r\nopen and I hear voices from the corridor.  The others wake up too.\r\nOne fellow, who has been there a couple of days already explains it\r\nto us: \"Up here in the corridor every morning the sisters say\r\nprayers.  They call it Morning Devotion.  And so that you can get\r\nyour share, they leave the door open.\"\r\n\r\nNo doubt it is well meant, but it gives us aches in our head and\r\nbones.\r\n\r\n\"Such an absurdity!\" I say, \"just when a man dropped off to sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"All the light cases are up here, that's why they do it here,\" he\r\nreplies.\r\n\r\nAlbert groans.  I get furious and call out: \"Be quiet out there!\"\r\n\r\nA minute later a sister appears.  In her black and white dress she\r\nlooks like a beautiful tea-cosy.  \"Shut the door, will you, sister?\"\r\nsays someone.\r\n\r\n\"We are saying prayers, that is why the door is open,\" she responds.\r\n\r\n\"But we want to go on sleeping----\"\r\n\r\n\"Prayer is better than sleep,\" she stands there and smiles\r\ninnocently.  \"And it is seven o'clock already.\"\r\n\r\nAlbert groans again.  \"Shut the door,\" I snort.\r\n\r\nShe is quite disconcerted.  Apparently she cannot understand.  \"But\r\nwe are saying prayers for you too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut the door, anyway.\"\r\n\r\nShe disappears leaving the door open.  The intoning of the Litany\r\nproceeds.\r\n\r\nI feel savage, and say: \"I'm going to count up to three.  If it\r\ndoesn't stop before then I'll let something fly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Me, too,\" says another.\r\n\r\nI count up to five.  Then I take hold of a bottle, aim, and heave it\r\nthrough the door into the corridor.  It smashes into a thousand\r\npieces.  The praying stops.  A swarm of sisters appear and reproach\r\nus in concert.\r\n\r\n\"Shut the door!\" we yell.\r\n\r\nThey withdraw.  The little one who came first is the last to go.\r\n\"Heathen,\" she chirps, but shuts the door all the same.  We have won.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nAt noon the hospital inspector arrives and abuses us.  He threatens\r\nus with clink and all the rest of it.  But a hospital inspector is\r\njust the same as a commissariat inspector, or any one else who wears\r\na long dagger and shoulder straps, but is really a clerk, and is\r\nnever considered even by a recruit as a real officer.  So we let him\r\ntalk.  What can they do to us, anyway----\r\n\r\n\"Who threw the bottle?\" he asks.\r\n\r\nBefore I can think whether I should report myself, someone says: \"I\r\ndid.\"\r\n\r\nA man with a bristling beard sits up.  Everyone is excited; why\r\nshould he report himself?\r\n\r\n\"You?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  I was annoyed because we were waked up unnecessarily and lost\r\nmy senses so that I did not know what I was doing.\"\r\n\r\nHe talks like a book.\r\n\r\n\"What is your name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Reinforcement-Reservist Josef Hamacher.\"\r\n\r\nThe inspector departs.\r\n\r\nWe are all curious.  \"But why did you say you did it?  It wasn't you\r\nat all!\"\r\n\r\nHe grins.  \"That doesn't matter.  I have a shooting licence.\"\r\n\r\nThen, of course, we all understand.  Whoever has a shooting licence\r\ncan do just whatever he pleases.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he explains, \"I got a crack in the head and they presented me\r\nwith a certificate to say that I was periodically not responsible for\r\nmy actions.  Ever since then I've had a grand time.  No one dares to\r\nannoy me.  And nobody does anything to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I reported myself because the shot amused me.  If they open the door\r\nagain to-morrow we will pitch another.\"\r\n\r\nWe are overjoyed.  With Josef Hamacher in our midst we can now risk\r\nanything.\r\n\r\nThen come the soundless, flat trollies to take us away.\r\n\r\nThe bandages are stuck fast.  We bellow like steers.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nThere are eight men in our room.  Peter, a curly black-haired fellow,\r\nhas the worst injury;--a severe lung wound.  Franz Wächter, alongside\r\nhim, has a shot in the arm which didn't look too bad at first.  But\r\nthe third night he calls out to us, telling us to ring, he thinks he\r\nhas a hæmorrhage.\r\n\r\nI ring loudly.  The night sister does not come.  We have been making\r\nrather heavy demands on her during the night, because we have all\r\nbeen freshly bandaged, and so have a good deal of pain.  One wants\r\nhis leg placed so, another so, a third wants water, a fourth wants\r\nher to shake up his pillow;--in the end the buxom old body grumbled\r\nbad temperedly and slammed the doors.  Now no doubt she thinks it is\r\nsomething of the same sort and so she is not coming.\r\n\r\nWe wait.  Then Franz says: \"Ring again.\"\r\n\r\nI do so.  Still she does not put in an appearance.  In our wing there\r\nis only one night sister, perhaps she has something to do in one of\r\nthe other rooms.  \"Franz, are you quite sure you are bleeding?\" I\r\nask.  \"Otherwise we shall be getting cursed again.\"\r\n\r\n\"The bandage is wet.  Can't anybody make a light?\"\r\n\r\nThat cannot be done either.  The switch is by the door and none of us\r\ncan stand up.  I hold my thumb against the button of the bell till it\r\nbecomes numb.  Perhaps the sister has fallen asleep.  They certainly\r\nhave a great deal to do and are all overworked day after day.  And\r\nadded to that is the everlasting praying.\r\n\r\n\"Should we smash a bottle?\" asks Josef Hamacher of the shooting\r\nlicence.\r\n\r\n\"She wouldn't hear that any more than the bell.\"\r\n\r\nAt last the door opens.  The old lady appears, mumbling.  When she\r\nperceives Franz's trouble she begins to bustle, and says: \"Why did\r\nnot someone say I was wanted?\"\r\n\r\n\"We did ring.  And none of us here can walk.\"\r\n\r\nHe has been bleeding badly and she binds him up.  In the morning we\r\nlook at his face, it has become sharp and yellow, whereas the evening\r\nbefore he looked almost healthy.  Now a sister comes oftener.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nSometimes there are red-cross voluntary aid sisters.  They are\r\npleasant, but often rather unskilled.  They frequently give us pain\r\nwhen re-making our beds, and then are so frightened that they hurt us\r\nstill more.\r\n\r\nThe nuns are more reliable.  They know how they must take hold of us,\r\nbut we would be more pleased if they were somewhat more cheerful.  A\r\nfew of them have real spirit, they are superb.  There is no one who\r\nwould not do anything for Sister Libertine, this marvellous sister,\r\nwho spreads good cheer through the whole wing even when she can only\r\nbe seen in the distance.  And there are others like her.  We would go\r\nthrough fire for her.  A man cannot really complain, here he is\r\ntreated by the nuns exactly like a civilian.  On the other hand, just\r\nto think of a garrison hospital gives a man the creeps.\r\n\r\nFranz Wachter does not regain his strength.  One day he is taken away\r\nand does not come back.  Josef Hamacher knows all about it: \"We\r\nshan't see him again.  They have put him in the dead room.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, Dead Room?\" asks Kropp.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Dying Room----\"\r\n\r\n\"What is that, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"A little room at the corner of the building.  Whoever is about to\r\nkick the bucket is put in there.  There are two beds in it.  It is\r\ngenerally called the Dying Room.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what do they do that for?\"\r\n\r\n\"They don't have so much work to do afterwards.  It is more\r\nconvenient, too, because it lies right beside the lift to the\r\nmortuary.  Perhaps also they do it for the sake of the others, so\r\nthat no one in the ward dies in sympathy.  And they can look after\r\nhim better, too, if he is by himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what about him?\"\r\n\r\nJosef shrugs his shoulders.  \"Usually he doesn't take much notice any\r\nmore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does everybody know about it then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Anyone who has been here long enough knows, of course.\"\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon Franz Wachter's bed has a fresh occupant.  A couple\r\nof days later they take the new man away, too.  Josef makes a\r\nsignificant gesture.  We see many come and go.\r\n\r\nOften relatives sit by the beds and weep or talk softly and\r\nawkwardly.  One old woman will not go away, but she cannot stay there\r\nthe whole night through.  Another morning she comes very early, but\r\nnot early enough; for as she goes up to the bed, someone else is in\r\nit already.  She has to go to the mortuary.  The apples that she has\r\nbrought with her she gives to us.\r\n\r\nAnd then little Peter begins to get worse.  His temperature chart\r\nlooks bad, and one day the flat trolley stands beside his bed.\r\n\"Where to?\" he asks.\r\n\r\n\"To the bandaging ward.\"\r\n\r\nHe is lifted out.  But the sister makes the mistake of removing his\r\ntunic from the hook and putting it on the trolley too, so that she\r\nshould not have to make two journeys.  Peter understands immediately\r\nand tries to roll off the trolley.  \"I'm stopping here!\"\r\n\r\nThey push him back.  He cries out feebly with his shattered lung: \"I\r\nwon't go to the Dying Room.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we are going to the bandaging ward.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what do you want my tunic for?\" He can speak no more.  Hoarse,\r\nagitated, he whispers: \"Stopping here!\"\r\n\r\nThey do not answer but wheel him out.  At the door he tries to raise\r\nhimself up.  His black curly head sways, his eyes are full of tears.\r\n\"I will come back again!  I will come back again!\" he cries.\r\n\r\nThe door shuts.  We are all excited; but we say nothing.  At last\r\nJosef says: \"Many a man has said that.  Once a man is in there, he\r\nnever comes through.\"\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nI am operated on and vomit for two days.  My bones will not grow\r\ntogether, so the surgeon's secretary says.  Another fellow's have\r\ngrown crooked; his are broken again.  It is disgusting.\r\n\r\nAmong our new arrivals there are two young soldiers with flat feet.\r\nThe chief surgeon discovers them on his rounds, and is overjoyed.\r\n\"We'll soon put that right,\" he tells them, \"we will just do a small\r\noperation, and then you will have perfectly sound feet.  Enter them\r\ndown, sister.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as he is gone, Josef, who knows everything, warns them:\r\n\"Don't you let him operate on you!  That is a special scientific\r\nstunt of the old boy's.  He goes absolutely crazy whenever he can get\r\nhold of anyone to do it on.  He operates on you for flat feet, and\r\nthere's no mistake, you don't have them any more; you have club feet\r\ninstead, and have to walk all the rest of your life on sticks.\"\r\n\r\n\"What should a man do, then?\" asks one of them.\r\n\r\n\"Say No.  You are here to be cured of your wound, not your flat feet.\r\nDid you have any trouble with them in the field?  No, well, there you\r\nare!  At present you can still walk, but if once the old boy gets you\r\nunder the knife you'll be cripples.  What he wants is little dogs to\r\nexperiment with, so the war is a glorious time for him, as it is for\r\nall the surgeons.  You take a look down below at the staff; there are\r\na dozen fellows hobbling around that he has operated on.  A lot of\r\nthem have been here all the time since 'fourteen and 'fifteen.  Not a\r\nsingle one of them can walk better than he could before, almost all\r\nof them worse, and most only with plaster legs.  Every six months he\r\ncatches them again and breaks their bones afresh, and every time is\r\ngoing to be the successful one.  You take my word, he won't dare to\r\ndo it if you say No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ach, man,\" says one of the two unfortunates, \"better your feet than\r\nyour brain-box.  There's no telling what you'll get if you go back\r\nout there again.  They can do with me just as they please, so long as\r\nI get back home.  Better to have a club foot than be dead.\"\r\n\r\nThe other, a young fellow like ourselves, won't have it done.  One\r\nmorning the old man has the two hauled up and lectures and jaws at\r\nthem so long, that in the end they consent.  What else could they\r\ndo?--They are mere privates, and he is a big bug.  They are brought\r\nback chloroformed and plastered.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nIt is going badly with Albert.  They have taken him and amputated his\r\nleg.  The whole leg has been taken off from the thigh.  Now he hardly\r\nspeaks any more.  Once he says he will shoot himself the first time\r\nhe can get hold of his revolver again.\r\n\r\nA new convoy arrives.  Our room gets two blind men.  One of them is a\r\nvery youthful musician.  The sisters never have a knife with them\r\nwhen they feed him; he has already snatched one from a sister.  But\r\nin spite of this caution there is an incident.  In the evening, while\r\nhe is being fed, the sister is called away, and leaves the plate with\r\nthe fork on his table.  He gropes for the fork, seizes it and drives\r\nit with all his force against his heart, then he snatches up a shoe\r\nand strikes with it against the handle as hard as he can.  We call\r\nfor help and three men are necessary to take the fork away from him.\r\nThe blunt prongs had already penetrated deep.  He abuses us all night\r\nso that no one can go to sleep.  In the morning he has lock-jaw.\r\n\r\nAgain beds become empty.  Day after day goes by with pain and fear,\r\ngroans and death-gurgles.  Even the Death Room is no use any more, it\r\nis too small; fellows die during the night in our room.  They go even\r\nfaster than the sisters can cope with them.\r\n\r\nBut one day the door flies open, the flat trolley rolls in, and there\r\non the stretcher, pale, thin, upright and triumphant, with his shaggy\r\nhead of curls sits Peter.  Sister Libertine with beaming looks pushes\r\nhim over to his former bed.  He is back from the Dying Room.  We have\r\nlong supposed him dead.\r\n\r\nHe looks round: \"What do you say now?\"\r\n\r\nAnd even Josef has to admit that it is the first time he has ever\r\nknown of such a thing.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nGradually a few of us venture to stand up.  And I am given crutches\r\nto hobble around on.  But I do not make much use of them; I cannot\r\nbear Albert's gaze as I move about the room.  His eyes always follow\r\nme with such a strange look.  So I sometimes escape to the\r\ncorridor;--there I can move about more freely.\r\n\r\nOn the next floor below are the abdominal and spine cases, head\r\nwounds and double amputations.  On the right side of the wing are the\r\njaw wounds, gas cases, nose, ear, and neck wounds.  On the left the\r\nblind and the lung wounds, pelvis wounds, wounds in the joints,\r\nwounds in the testicles, wounds in the intestines.  Here a man\r\nrealizes for the first time in how many places a man can get hit.\r\n\r\nTwo fellows die of tetanus.  Their skin turns pale, their limbs\r\nstiffen, at last only their eyes live--stubbornly.  Many of the\r\nwounded have their shattered limbs hanging free in the air from a\r\ngallows; underneath the wound a basin is placed into which the pus\r\ndrips.  Every two or three hours the vessel is emptied.  Other men\r\nlie in stretching bandages with heavy weights hanging from the end of\r\nthe bed.  I see intestine wounds that are constantly full of excreta.\r\nThe surgeon's clerk shows me X-ray photographs of completely smashed\r\nhip-bones, knees, and shoulders.\r\n\r\nA man cannot realize that above such shattered bodies there are still\r\nhuman faces in which life goes its daily round.  And this is only one\r\nhospital, one single station; there are hundreds of thousands in\r\nGermany, hundreds of thousands in France, hundreds of thousands in\r\nRussia.  How senseless is everything that can ever be written, done,\r\nor thought, when such things are possible.  It must all be lies and\r\nof no account when the culture of a thousand years could not prevent\r\nthis stream of blood being poured out, these torture-chambers in\r\ntheir hundreds of thousands.  A hospital alone shows what war is.\r\n\r\nI am young, I am twenty years old; yet I know nothing of life but\r\ndespair, death, fear, and fatuous superficiality cast over an abyss\r\nof sorrow.  I see how peoples are set against one another, and in\r\nsilence, unknowingly, foolishly, obediently, innocently slay one\r\nanother.  I see that the keenest brains of the world invent weapons\r\nand words to make it yet more refined and enduring.  And all men of\r\nmy age, here and over there, throughout the whole world, see these\r\nthings; all my generation is experiencing these things with me.  What\r\nwould our fathers do if we suddenly stood up and came before them and\r\nproffered our account?  What do they expect of us if a time ever\r\ncomes when the war is over?  Through the years our business has been\r\nkilling;--it was our first calling in life.  Our knowledge of life is\r\nlimited to death.  What will happen afterwards?  And what shall come\r\nout of us?\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nThe oldest man in our room is Lewandowski.  He is forty, and has\r\nalready lain ten months in the hospital with a severe abdominal\r\nwound.  Just in the last few weeks he has improved sufficiently to be\r\nable to hobble about doubled up.\r\n\r\nFor some days past he has been in great excitement.  His wife has\r\nwritten to him from the little home in Poland where she lives,\r\ntelling him that she has saved up enough money to pay for the fare,\r\nand is coming to see him.\r\n\r\nShe is already on the way and may arrive any day.  Lewandowski has\r\nlost his appetite, he even gives away red cabbage and sausage after\r\nhe has had a couple of mouthfuls.  He goes round the room perpetually\r\nwith the letter.  Everyone has already read it a dozen times, the\r\npost-marks have been examined heaven knows how often, the address is\r\nhardly legible any longer for spots of grease and thumb-marks, and in\r\nthe end what is sure to happen, happens: Lewandowski develops a\r\nfever, and has to go back to bed.\r\n\r\nHe has not seen his wife for two years.  In the meantime she has\r\ngiven birth to a child, whom she is bringing with her.  But something\r\nelse occupies Lewandowski's thoughts.  He had hoped to get permission\r\nto go out when his old woman came; for obviously seeing is all very\r\nwell, but when a man gets his wife again after such a long time, if\r\nat all possible, a man wants something else besides.\r\n\r\nLewandowski has discussed it all with us at great length; in the army\r\nthere are no secrets about such things.  And what's more, nobody\r\nfinds anything objectionable in it.  Those of us who are already able\r\nto go out have told him of a couple of very good spots in the town,\r\nparks and squares, where he would not be disturbed; one of us even\r\nknows of a little room.\r\n\r\nBut what is the use, there Lewandowski lies in bed with his troubles.\r\nLife holds no more joy for him if he has to forego this affair.  We\r\nconsole him and promise to get over the difficulty somehow or other.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon his wife appears, a tousled little thing with anxious,\r\nquick eyes like a bird, in a sort of black, crinkly mantilla with\r\nribbons; heaven knows where she inherited the thing.\r\n\r\nShe murmurs something softly and stands shyly in the doorway.  It\r\nterrifies her that there are six of us men present.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Marja,\" says Lewandowski, and gulps dangerously with his\r\nAdam's apple, \"you can come in all right, they won't hurt you.\"\r\n\r\nShe goes the round and proffers each of us her hand.  Then she\r\nproduces the child, which in the interval has done something in its\r\nnapkin.  From a large handbag embroidered with pearls she takes out a\r\nclean one and makes the child fresh and presentable.  This dispels\r\nher first embarrassment, and the two begin to talk.\r\n\r\nLewandowski is very fidgety, every now and then he squints across at\r\nus most unhappily with his round goggle eyes.\r\n\r\nThe time is favourable, the doctor's visit is over, at the most there\r\ncouldn't be more than one sister left in the ward.  So one of us goes\r\nout to prospect.  He comes back and nods.\r\n\r\n\"Not a soul to be seen.  Now's your chance, Johann, set to.\"\r\n\r\nThe two speak together in an undertone.  The woman turns a little red\r\nand looks embarrassed.  We grin good-naturedly and make pooh-poohing\r\ngestures, what does it matter!  The devil take all the conventions,\r\nthey were made for other times; here lies the carpenter Johann\r\nLewandowski, a soldier shot to a cripple, and there is his wife; who\r\nknows when he will see her again?  He wants to have her, and he\r\nshould have her, good.\r\n\r\nTwo men stand at the door to forestall the sisters and keep them\r\noccupied if they chance to come along.  They agree to stand guard for\r\na quarter of an hour or thereabouts.\r\n\r\nLewandowski can only lie on his side, so one of us props a couple of\r\npillows against his back.  Albert gets the child to hold, we all turn\r\nround a bit, the black mantilla disappears under the bed-clothes, we\r\nmake a great clatter and play skat noisily.\r\n\r\nAll goes well.  I hold a club solo with four jacks which nearly goes\r\nthe round.  In the process we almost forget Lewandowski.  After a\r\nwhile the child begins to squall, although Albert, in desperation,\r\nrocks it to and fro.  Then there is a bit of creaking and rustling,\r\nand as we look up casually we see that the child has the bottle in\r\nits mouth, and is back again with its mother.  The business is over.\r\n\r\nWe now feel ourselves like one big family, the woman is rather\r\nquieter, and Lewandowski lies there sweating and beaming.\r\n\r\nHe unpacks the embroidered handbag, and some good sausages come to\r\nlight; Lewandowski takes up the knife with a flourish and saws the meat\r\ninto slices.\r\n\r\nWith a handsome gesture he waves toward us--and the little woman goes\r\nfrom one to the other and smiles at us and hands round the sausage;\r\nshe now looks quite handsome.  We call her Mother, she is pleased and\r\nshakes up our pillows for us.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nAfter a few weeks I have to go each morning to the massage\r\ndepartment.  There my leg is harnessed up and made to move.  The arm\r\nhas healed long since.\r\n\r\nNew convoys arrive from the line.  The bandages are no longer made of\r\ncloth, but of white crêpe paper.  Rag bandages have become scarce at\r\nthe front.\r\n\r\nAlbert's stump heals well.  The wound is almost closed.  In a few\r\nweeks he should go off to an institute for artificial limbs.  He\r\ncontinues not to talk much, and is much more solemn than formerly.\r\nHe often breaks off in his speech and stares in front of him.  If he\r\nwere not here with us he would have shot himself long ago.  But now\r\nhe is over the worst of it, and he often looks on while we play skat.\r\n\r\nI get convalescent leave.\r\n\r\nMy mother does not want to let me go away.  She is so feeble.  It is\r\nall much worse than it was last time.\r\n\r\nThen I am sent on from the base and return once more to the line.\r\n\r\nParting from my friend Albert Kropp was very hard.  But a man gets\r\nused to that sort of thing in the army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nWe count the weeks no more.  It was winter when I came up, and when\r\nthe shells exploded the frozen clods of earth were just as dangerous\r\nas the fragments.  Now the trees are green again.  Our life\r\nalternates between billets and the front.  We have almost grown\r\naccustomed to it; war is a cause of death like cancer and\r\ntuberculosis, like influenza and dysentery.  The deaths are merely\r\nmore frequent, more varied and terrible.\r\n\r\nOur thoughts are clay, they are moulded with the changes of the\r\ndays;--when we are resting they are good; under fire, they are dead.\r\nFields of craters within and without.\r\n\r\nEveryone is so, not only ourselves here--the things that existed\r\nbefore are no longer valid, and one practically knows them no more.\r\nDistinctions, breeding, education are changed, are almost blotted out\r\nand hardly recognizable any longer.  Sometimes they give an advantage\r\nfor profiting by a situation;--but they also bring consequences along\r\nwith them, in that they arouse prejudices which have to be overcome.\r\nIt is as though formerly we were coins of different provinces; and\r\nnow we are melted down, and all bear the same stamp.  To re-discover\r\nthe old distinctions, the metal itself must be tested.  First we are\r\nsoldiers and afterwards, in a strange and shamefaced fashion,\r\nindividual men as well.\r\n\r\nIt is a great brotherhood, which to a condition of life arising out\r\nof the midst of danger, out of the tension and forlornness of death,\r\nadds something of the good-fellowship of the folk-song, of the\r\nfeeling of solidarity of convicts, and of the desperate loyalty to\r\none another of men condemned to death--seeking in a wholly unpathetic\r\nway a fleeting enjoyment of the hours as they come.  If one wants to\r\nappraise it, it is at once heroic and banal--but who wants to do that?\r\n\r\nIt is this, for example, that makes Tjaden spoon down his ham-and-pea\r\nsoup in such tearing haste when an enemy attack is reported, simply\r\nbecause he cannot be sure that in an hour's time he will still be\r\nalive.  We have discussed at length, whether it is right or not to do\r\nso.  Kat condemns it, because, he says, a man has to reckon with the\r\npossibility of an abdominal wound, and that is more dangerous on a\r\nfull stomach than on an empty one.\r\n\r\nSuch things are real problems, they are serious matters to us, they\r\ncannot be otherwise.  Here, on the borders of death, life follows an\r\namazingly simple course, it is limited to what is most necessary, all\r\nelse lies buried in gloomy sleep;--in that lies our primitiveness and\r\nour survival.  Were we more subtly differentiated we must long since\r\nhave gone mad, have deserted, or have fallen.  As in a polar\r\nexpedition, every expression of life must serve only the preservation\r\nof existence, and is absolutely focussed on that.  All else is\r\nbanished because it would consume energies unnecessarily.  That is\r\nthe only way to save ourselves.  In the quiet hours when the puzzling\r\nreflection of former days, like a blurred mirror, projects beyond me\r\nthe figure of my present existence, I often sit over against myself,\r\nas before a stranger, and wonder how the unnameable active principle\r\nthat calls itself Life has adapted itself even to this form.  All\r\nother expressions lie in a winter sleep, life is simply one continual\r\nwatch against the menace of death;--it has transformed us into\r\nunthinking animals in order to give us the weapon of instinct--it has\r\nreinforced us with dullness, so that we do not go to pieces before\r\nthe horror, which would overwhelm us if we had clear, conscious\r\nthought--it has awakened in us the sense of comradeship, so that we\r\nescape the abyss of solitude--it has lent us the indifference of wild\r\ncreatures, so that in spite of all we perceive the positive in every\r\nmoment, and store it up as a reserve against the onslaught of\r\nnothingness.  Thus we live a closed, hard existence of the utmost\r\nsuperficiality, and rarely does an incident strike out a spark.  But\r\nthen unexpectedly a flame of grievous and terrible yearning flares up.\r\n\r\nThose are the dangerous moments.  They show us that the adjustment is\r\nonly artificial, that it is not simple rest, but sharpest struggle\r\nfor rest.  In the outward form of our life we are hardly\r\ndistinguishable from Bushmen; but whereas the latter can be so\r\nalways, because they are so truly, and at best may develop further by\r\nexertion of their spiritual forces, with us it is the reverse;--our\r\ninner forces are not exerted toward regeneration, but toward\r\ndegeneration.  The Bushmen are primitive and naturally so, but we are\r\nprimitive in an artificial sense, and by virtue of the utmost effort.\r\n\r\nAnd at night, waking out of a dream, overwhelmed and bewitched by the\r\ncrowding faces, a man perceives with alarm how slight is the support,\r\nhow thin the boundary that divides him from the darkness.  We are\r\nlittle flames poorly sheltered by frail walls against the storm of\r\ndissolution and madness, in which we flicker and sometimes almost go\r\nout.  Then the muffled roar of the battle becomes a ring that\r\nencircles us, we creep in upon ourselves, and with big eyes stare\r\ninto the night.  Our only comfort is the steady breathing of our\r\ncomrades asleep, and thus we wait for the morning.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nEvery day and every hour every shell and every death cuts into this\r\nthin support, and the years waste it rapidly.  I see how it is\r\nalready gradually breaking down around me.\r\n\r\nThere is the mad story of Detering.\r\n\r\nHe was one of those who kept himself to himself.  His misfortune was\r\nthat he saw a cherry tree in a garden.  We were just coming back from\r\nthe front line, and at a turning of the road near our new billets,\r\nmarvellous in the morning twilight, stood this cherry tree before us.\r\nIt had no leaves, but was one white mass of blossom.\r\n\r\nIn the evening Detering was not to be seen.  Then at last he came\r\nback and had a couple of branches of cherry blossom in his hand.  We\r\nmade fun of him, and asked whether he was going to a wedding.  He\r\nmade no answer, but laid them on his bed.  During the night I heard\r\nhim making a noise, he seemed to be packing.  I sensed something\r\namiss and went over to him.  He made out it was nothing, and I said\r\nto him: \"Don't do anything silly, Detering.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ach, why--it's merely that I can't sleep----\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you pick the cherry branches for?\"\r\n\r\n\"I might have been going to get some more cherry branches,\" he\r\nreplied, evasively--and after a while: \"I have a big orchard with\r\ncherry trees at home.  When they are in blossom, from the hay loft\r\nthey look like one single sheet, so white.  It is just the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you will get leave soon.  You may even be sent back as a\r\nfarmer.\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded, but he was far away.  When these peasants are excited they\r\nhave a curious expression, a mixture of cow and yearning god, half\r\nstupid and half rapt.  In order to turn him away from his thoughts I\r\nasked him for a piece of bread.  He gave it to me without a murmur.\r\nThat was suspicious, for he is usually tight-fisted.  So I stayed\r\nawake.  Nothing happened; in the morning he was as usual.\r\n\r\nApparently he had noticed that I had been watching him;--but the\r\nsecond morning after he was gone.  I noticed it, but said nothing, in\r\norder to give him time; he might perhaps get through.  Various\r\nfellows have already got into Holland.\r\n\r\nBut at roll call he was missed.  A week after we heard that he had\r\nbeen caught by the field gendarmes, those despicable military police.\r\nHe had headed toward Germany, that was hopeless, of course--and, of\r\ncourse, he did everything else just as idiotically.  Anyone might\r\nhave known that his flight was only home-sickness and a momentary\r\naberration.  But what does a court martial hundreds of miles behind\r\nthe front-line know about it?  We have heard nothing more of Detering.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nBut sometimes it broke out in other ways, this danger, these pent-up\r\nthings, as from an overheated boiler.  It will be enough to tell how\r\nBerger met his end.\r\n\r\nOur trenches have now for some time been shot to pieces, and we have\r\nan elastic line, so that there is practically no longer any proper\r\ntrench warfare.  When attack and counter-attack have waged backwards\r\nand forwards there remains a broken line and a bitter struggle from\r\ncrater to crater.  The front line has been penetrated, and everywhere\r\nsmall groups have established themselves, the fight is carried on\r\nfrom clusters of shell-holes.\r\n\r\nWe are in a crater, the English are coming down obliquely, they are\r\nturning our flank and working in behind us.  We are surrounded.  It\r\nis not easy to surrender, fog and smoke hang over us, no one would\r\nrecognize that we wanted to give ourselves up, and perhaps we don't\r\nwant to, a man doesn't even know himself at such moments.  We hear\r\nthe explosions of the hand-grenades coming toward us.  Our\r\nmachine-gun sweeps over the semicircle in front of us.  The\r\ncooling-water evaporates, we hastily pass round the case, every man\r\npisses in it, and thus we again have water, and are able to continue\r\nfiring.  But behind us the attack crashes ever nearer.\r\n\r\nA few minutes and we are lost.\r\n\r\nThen, at closest range, a second machine-gun bursts out.  It is set\r\nup in a crater alongside us; Berger has fetched it, and now the\r\ncounter-attack comes over from behind; we are set free and make\r\ncontact with the rear.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, as we lie in comparatively good cover, one of the\r\nfood-carriers reports that a couple of hundred yards distant there\r\nlies a wounded messenger-dog.\r\n\r\n\"Where?\" asks Berger.\r\n\r\nThe other describes the place to him.  Berger goes off either to\r\nfetch the beast in or to shoot it.  Six months ago he would not have\r\ncared, he would have been reasonable.  We try to prevent him.  Then,\r\nas he goes off grimly, all we can say is: \"You're mad,\" and let him\r\ngo.  For these cases of front-line madness become dangerous if one is\r\nnot able to fling the man to the ground and hold him fast.  And\r\nBerger is six feet and the most powerful man in the company.\r\n\r\nHe is absolutely mad for he has to pass through the barrage; but this\r\nlightning that lowers somewhere above us all has struck him and made\r\nhim demented.  It affects others so that they begin to rave, to run\r\naway--there was one man who even tried to dig himself into the ground\r\nwith hands, feet, and teeth.\r\n\r\nIt is true, such things are often simulated, but the pretence itself\r\nis a symptom.  Berger, who means to finish off the dog, is carried\r\noff with a wound in the pelvis, and one of the fellows who carry him\r\ngets a bullet in the cheek while doing it.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nMüller is dead.  Someone shot him point blank with a Verey light in\r\nthe stomach.  He lived for half an hour, quite conscious, and in\r\nterrible pain.\r\n\r\nBefore he died he handed over his pocketbook to me, and bequeathed me\r\nhis boots--the same that he once inherited from Kemmerich.  I wear\r\nthem, for they fit me quite well.  After me Tjaden will get them, I\r\nhave promised them to him.\r\n\r\nWe have been able to bury Müller, but he is not likely to remain long\r\nundisturbed.  Our lines are falling back.  There are too many fresh\r\nEnglish and American regiments over there.  There's too much corned\r\nbeef and white wheaten bread.  Too many new guns.  Too many\r\naeroplanes.\r\n\r\nBut we are emaciated and starved.  Our food is so bad and mixed up\r\nwith so much substitute stuff that it makes us ill.  The factory\r\nowners in Germany have grown wealthy;--dysentery dissolves our\r\nbowels.  The latrine poles are always densely crowded; the people at\r\nhome ought to be shown these grey, yellow, miserable, wasted faces\r\nhere, these bent figures from whose bodies the colic wrings out the\r\nblood, and who with lips trembling and distorted with pain, grin at\r\none another and say: \"It is not much sense pulling up one's trousers\r\nagain----\"\r\n\r\nOur artillery is fired out, it has too few shells and the barrels are\r\nso worn that they shoot uncertainly, and scatter so widely as even to\r\nfall on ourselves.  We have too few horses.  Our fresh troops are\r\nanaemic boys in need of rest, who cannot carry a pack, but merely\r\nknow how to die.  By thousands.  They understand nothing about\r\nwarfare, they simply go on and let themselves be shot down.  A single\r\nflyer routed two companies of them for a joke, just as they came\r\nfresh from the train--before they had ever heard of such a thing as\r\ncover.\r\n\r\n\"Germany ought to be empty soon,\" says Kat.\r\n\r\nWe have given up hope that some day an end may come.  We never think\r\nso far.  A man can stop a bullet and be killed; he can get wounded,\r\nand then the hospital is his next stop.  There, if they do not\r\namputate him, he sooner or later falls into the hands of one of those\r\nstaff surgeons who, with the War Service Cross in his button-hole,\r\nsays to him: \"What, one leg a bit short?  If you have any pluck you\r\ndon't need to run at the front.  The man is A1.  Dismiss!\"\r\n\r\nKat tells a story that has travelled the whole length of the front\r\nfrom the Vosges to Flanders;--of the staff surgeon who reads the\r\nnames on the list, and when a man comes before him, without looking\r\nup, says: \"A1.  We need soldiers up there.\"  A fellow with a wooden\r\nleg comes up before him, the staff surgeon again says A1----  \"And\r\nthen,\" Kat raises his voice, \"the fellow says to him: 'I already have\r\na wooden leg, but when I go back again and they shoot off my head,\r\nthen I will get a wooden head made and become a staff surgeon.\"  This\r\nanswer tickles us all immensely.\r\n\r\nThere may be good doctors, and there are, lots of them; all the same,\r\nevery soldier some time during his hundreds of inspections falls into\r\nthe clutches of one of these countless hero-grabbers who pride\r\nthemselves on changing as many C3's and B3's as possible into A1's.\r\n\r\nThere are many such stories, they are mostly far more bitter.  All\r\nthe same, they have nothing to do with mutiny or lead-swinging.  They\r\nare merely honest and call a thing by its name; for there is a very\r\ngreat deal of fraud, injustice, and baseness in the army.--Is it\r\nnothing that regiment after regiment returns again and again to the\r\never more hopeless struggle, that attack follows attack along the\r\nweakening, retreating, crumbling line?\r\n\r\nFrom a mockery the tanks have become a terrible weapon.  Armoured\r\nthey come rolling on in long lines, and more than anything else\r\nembody for us the horror of war.\r\n\r\nWe do not see the guns that bombard us; the attacking lines of the\r\nenemy infantry are men like ourselves; but these tanks are machines,\r\ntheir caterpillars run on as endless as the war, they are\r\nannihilation, they roll without feeling into the craters, and climb\r\nup again without stopping, a fleet of roaring, smoke-belching\r\narmour-clads, invulnerable steel beasts squashing the dead and the\r\nwounded--we shrivel up in our thin skin before them, against their\r\ncolossal weight our arms are sticks of straw, and our hand-grenades\r\nmatches.\r\n\r\nShells, gas clouds, and flotillas of tanks--shattering, starvation,\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nDysentery, influenza, typhus--murder, burning, death.\r\n\r\nTrenches, hospitals, the common grave--there are no other\r\npossibilities.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nIn one attack our Company Commander, Bertinck, falls.  He was one of\r\nthose superb front-line officers who are foremost in every hot place.\r\nHe was with us for two years without being wounded, so that something\r\nhad to happen in the end.\r\n\r\nWe occupy a crater and get surrounded.  The stink of petroleum or oil\r\nblows across with the fumes of powder.  Two fellows with a\r\nflame-thrower are seen, one carries the tin on his back, the other\r\nhas the hose in his hands from which the fire spouts.  If they get so\r\nnear that they can reach us we are done for, we cannot retreat yet.\r\n\r\nWe open fire on them.  But they work nearer and things begin to look\r\nbad.  Bertinck is lying in the hole with us.  When he sees that we\r\ncannot escape because under the sharp fire we must make the most of\r\nthis cover, he takes a rifle, crawls out of the hole, and lying down\r\npropped on his elbows, he takes aim.  He fires--the same moment a\r\nbullet smacks into him, they have got him.  Still he lies and aims\r\nagain;--once he shifts and again takes his aim; at last the rifle\r\ncracks.  Bertinck lets the gun drop and says: \"Good,\" and slips back\r\ninto the hole.  The hindermost of the two flame-throwers is hit, he\r\nfalls, the hose slips away from the other fellow, the fire squirts\r\nabout on all sides and the man burns.\r\n\r\nBertinck has a chest wound.  After a while a fragment smashes away\r\nhis chin, and the same fragment has sufficient force to tear open\r\nLeer's hip.  Leer groans as he supports himself on his arm, he bleeds\r\nquickly, no one can help him.  Like an emptying tube, after a couple\r\nof minutes he collapses.\r\n\r\nWhat use is it to him now that he was such a good mathematician at\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nThe months pass by.  The summer of 1918 is the most bloody and the\r\nmost terrible.  The days stand like angels in gold and blue,\r\nincomprehensible, above the ring of annihilation.  Every man here\r\nknows that we are losing the war.  Not much is said about it, we are\r\nfalling back, we will not be able to attack again after this big\r\noffensive, we have no more men and no more ammunition.\r\n\r\nStill the campaign goes on--the dying goes on----\r\n\r\nSummer of 1918--Never has life in its niggardliness seemed to us so\r\ndesirable as now;--the red poppies in the meadows round our billets,\r\nthe smooth beetles on the blades of grass, the warm evenings in the\r\ncool, dim rooms, the black, mysterious trees of the twilight, the\r\nstars and the flowing waters, dreams and long sleep----.  O Life,\r\nlife, life!\r\n\r\nSummer of 1918--Never was so much silently suffered as in the moment\r\nwhen we depart once again for the front-line.  Wild, tormenting\r\nrumours of an armistice and peace are in the air, they lay hold on\r\nour hearts and make the return to the front harder than ever.\r\n\r\nSummer of 1918--Never was life in the line more bitter and more full\r\nof horror than in the hours of the bombardment, when the blanched\r\nfaces lie in the dirt, and the hands clutch at the one thought: No!\r\nNo!  Not now!  Not now at the last moment!\r\n\r\nSummer of 1918--Breath of hope that sweeps over the scorched fields,\r\nraging fever of impatience, of disappointment, of the most agonizing\r\nterror of death, insensate question: Why?  Why do they not make an\r\nend?  And why do these rumours of an end fly about?\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nThere are so many airmen here, and they are so sure of themselves\r\nthat they give chase to single individuals, just as though they were\r\nhares.  For every one German plane there come at least five English\r\nand American.  For one hungry, wretched German soldier come five of\r\nthe enemy, fresh and fit.  For one German army loaf there are fifty\r\ntins of canned beef over there.  We are not beaten, for as soldiers\r\nwe are better and more experienced; we are simply crushed and driven\r\nback by overwhelmingly superior forces.\r\n\r\nBehind us lie rainy weeks--grey sky, grey fluid earth, grey dying.\r\nIf we go out, the rain at once soaks through our overcoat and\r\nclothing;--and we remain wet all the time we are in the line.  We\r\nnever get dry.  Those who still wear high boots tie sand bags round\r\nthe top so that the mud does not pour in so fast.  The rifles are\r\ncaked, the uniforms caked, everything is fluid and dissolved, the\r\nearth one dripping, soaked, oily mass in which lie the yellow pools\r\nwith red spiral streams of blood and into which the dead, wounded,\r\nand survivors slowly sink down.\r\n\r\nThe storm lashes us, out of the confusion of grey and yellow the hail\r\nof splinters whips forth the childlike cries of the wounded, and in\r\nthe night shattered life groans wearily to the silence.\r\n\r\nOur hands are earth, our bodies clay and our eyes pools of rain.  We\r\ndo not know whether we still live.\r\n\r\nThen the heat sinks heavily into our shell holes like a jelly fish,\r\nmoist and oppressive, and on one of these late summer days, while\r\nbringing food, Kat falls.  We two are alone.  I bind up his wound;\r\nhis shin seems to be smashed.  It has got the bone, and Kat groans\r\ndesperately: \"At last--just at the last----\"\r\n\r\nI comfort him.  \"Who knows how long the mess will go on yet!  Now you\r\nare saved----\"\r\n\r\nThe wound begins to bleed fast.  Kat cannot be left by himself while\r\nI try to find a stretcher.  Anyway, I don't know of a\r\nstretcher-bearer's post in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nKat is not very heavy; so I take him up on my back and start off to\r\nthe dressing station with him.\r\n\r\nTwice we rest.  He suffers acutely on the way.  We do not speak much.\r\nI have opened the collar of my tunic and breathe heavily, I sweat and\r\nmy face is swollen with the strain of carrying.  All the same I urge\r\nhim to let us go on, for the place is dangerous.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we go on again, Kat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Must, Paul.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then come.\"\r\n\r\nI raise him up, he stands on the uninjured leg and supports himself\r\nagainst a tree.  I take up the wounded leg carefully, then he gives a\r\njump and I take the knee of the sound leg also under my arm.\r\n\r\nThe going is more difficult.  Often a shell whistles across.  I go as\r\nquickly as I can, for the blood from Kat's wound drips to the ground.\r\nWe cannot shelter ourselves properly from the explosions; before we\r\ncan take cover the danger is all over.\r\n\r\nWe lie down in a small shell hole to rest.  I give Kat some tea from\r\nmy water bottle.  We smoke a cigarette.  \"Well, Kat,\" I say gloomily,\r\n\"We are going to be separated at last.\"\r\n\r\nHe is silent and looks at me.\r\n\r\n\"Do you remember, Kat, how we commandeered the goose?  And how you\r\nbrought me out of the barrage when I was still a young recruit and\r\nwas wounded for the first time?  I cried then.  Kat, that is almost\r\nthree years ago.\"\r\n\r\nHe nods.\r\n\r\nThe anguish of solitude rises up in me.  When Kat is taken away I\r\nwill not have one friend left.\r\n\r\n\"Kat, in any case we must see one another again, if it is peace time\r\nbefore you come back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think that I will be marked A1 again with this leg?\" he asks\r\nbitterly.\r\n\r\n\"With rest it will get better.  The joint is all right.  It may limp\r\na bit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me another cigarette,\" he says.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps we could do something together later on, Kat.\"  I am very\r\nmiserable, it is impossible that Kat--Kat my friend, Kat with the\r\ndrooping shoulders and the poor, thin moustache, Kat, whom I know as\r\nI know no other man, Kat with whom I have shared these years--it is\r\nimpossible that perhaps I shall not see Kat again.\r\n\r\n\"In any case give me your address at home, Kat.  And here is mine, I\r\nwill write it down for you.\"\r\n\r\nI write his address in my pocket book.  How forlorn I am already,\r\nthough he still sits here beside me.  Couldn't I shoot myself quickly\r\nin the foot so as to be able to go with him.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Kat gurgles and turns green and yellow.  \"Let us go on,\" he\r\nstammers.\r\n\r\nI jump up, eager to help him, I take him up and start off at a run, a\r\nslow steady pace, so as not to jolt his leg too much.\r\n\r\nMy throat is parched; everything dances red and black before my eyes,\r\nI stagger on doggedly and pitilessly and at last reach the dressing\r\nstation.\r\n\r\nThere I drop down on my knees, but have still enough strength to fall\r\non to the side where Kat's sound leg is.  After a few minutes I\r\nstraighten myself up again.  My legs and my hands tremble.  I have\r\ntrouble in finding my water bottle, to take a pull.  My lips tremble\r\nas I try to drink.  But I smile--Kat is saved.\r\n\r\nAfter a while I begin to sort out the confusion of voices that falls\r\non my ears.\r\n\r\n\"You might have spared yourself that,\" says an orderly.\r\n\r\nI look at him without comprehending.\r\n\r\nHe points to Kat.  \"He is stone dead.\"\r\n\r\nI do not understand him.  \"He has been hit in the shin,\" I say.\r\n\r\nThe orderly stands still.  \"That as well.\"\r\n\r\nI turn round.  My eyes are still dulled, the sweat breaks out on me\r\nagain, it runs over my eyelids.  I wipe it away and peer at Kat.  He\r\nlies still.  \"Fainted,\" I say quickly.\r\n\r\nThe orderly whistles softly.  \"I know better than that.  He is dead.\r\nI'll lay any money on that.\"\r\n\r\nI shake my head: \"Not possible.  Only ten minutes ago I was talking\r\nto him.  He has fainted.\"\r\n\r\nKat's hands are warm, I pass my arm under his shoulders in order to\r\nrub his temples with some tea.  I feel my fingers become moist.  As I\r\ndraw them away from behind his head, they are bloody.  \"You see----\"\r\nThe orderly whistles once more through his teeth.\r\n\r\nOn the way without my having noticed it, Kat has caught a splinter in\r\nthe head.  There is just one little hole, it must have been a very\r\ntiny, stray splinter.  But it has sufficed.  Kat is dead.\r\n\r\nSlowly I get up.\r\n\r\n\"Would you like to take his pay book and his things?\" the\r\nlance-corporal asks me.\r\n\r\nI nod, and he gives them to me.\r\n\r\nThe orderly is mystified.  \"You are not related, are you?\"\r\n\r\nNo, we are not related.  No, we are not related.\r\n\r\nDo I walk?  Have I feet still?  I raise my eyes, I let them move\r\nround, and turn myself with them, one circle, one circle, and I stand\r\nin the midst.  All is as usual.  Only the Militiaman Stanislaus\r\nKatczinsky has died.\r\n\r\nThen I know nothing more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nIt is autumn.  There are not many of the old hands left.  I am the\r\nlast of the seven fellows from our class.\r\n\r\nEveryone talks of peace and armistice.  All wait.  If it again proves\r\nan illusion, then they will break up; hope is high, it cannot be\r\ntaken away again without an upheaval.  If there is not peace, then\r\nthere will be revolution.\r\n\r\nI have fourteen days rest, because I have swallowed a bit of gas; in\r\na little garden I sit the whole day long in the sun.  The armistice\r\nis coming soon, I believe it now too.  Then we will go home.\r\n\r\nHere my thoughts stop and will not go any farther.  All that meets\r\nme, all that floods over me are but feelings--greed of life, love of\r\nhome, yearning of the blood, intoxication of deliverance.  But no\r\naims.\r\n\r\nHad we returned home in 1916, out of the suffering and the strength\r\nof our experiences we might have unleashed a storm.  Now if we go\r\nback we will be weary, broken, burnt out, rootless, and without hope.\r\nWe will not be able to find our way any more.\r\n\r\nAnd men will not understand us--for the generation that grew up\r\nbefore us, though it has passed these years with us here, already had\r\na home and a calling; now it will return to its old occupations, and\r\nthe war will be forgotten--and the generation that has grown up after\r\nus will be strange to us and push us aside.  We will be superfluous\r\neven to ourselves, we will grow older, a few will adapt themselves,\r\nsome others will merely submit, and most will be bewildered;--the\r\nyears will pass by and in the end we shall fall into ruin.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps all this that I think is mere melancholy and dismay,\r\nwhich will fly away as the dust, when I stand once again beneath the\r\npoplars and listen to the rustling of their leaves.  It cannot be\r\nthat it has gone, the yearning that made our blood unquiet, the\r\nunknown, the perplexing, the oncoming things, the thousand faces of\r\nthe future, the melodies from dreams and from books, the whispers and\r\ndivinations of women, it cannot be that this has vanished in\r\nbombardment, in despair, in brothels.\r\n\r\nHere the trees show gay and golden, the berries of the rowan stand\r\nred among the leaves, country roads run white out to the sky line,\r\nand the canteens hum like beehives with rumours of peace.\r\n\r\nI stand up.\r\n\r\nI am very quiet.  Let the months and years come, they bring me\r\nnothing more, they can bring me nothing more.  I am so alone, and so\r\nwithout hope that I can confront them without fear.  The life that\r\nhas borne me through these years is still in my hands and my eyes.\r\nWhether I have subdued it, I know not.  But so long as it is there it\r\nwill seek its own way out, heedless of the will that is within me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe fell in October 1918, on a day that was so quiet and still on the\r\nwhole front, that the army report confined itself to the single\r\nsentence: All quiet on the Western Front.\r\n\r\nHe had fallen forward and lay on the earth as though sleeping.\r\nTurning him over one saw that he could not have suffered long; his\r\nface had an expression of calm, as though almost glad the end had\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHISWICK PRESS: CHARLES WHITTINGHAM AND GRIGGS (PRINTERS), LTD.\r\n\r\nTOOKS COURT, CHANCERY LANE, LONDON.",
