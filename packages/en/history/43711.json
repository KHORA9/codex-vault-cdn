(ABERD.)\r\n\r\n  PROFESSOR OF CHINESE IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE\r\n  AND LATE H. B. M. CONSUL AT NINGPO\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  NEW YORK AND LONDON\r\n  D. APPLETON AND COMPANY\r\n  1927\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  COPYRIGHT, 1901,\r\n  BY D. APPLETON AND COMPANY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Printed in the United States of America\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the first attempt made in any language, including Chinese, to\r\nproduce a history of Chinese literature.\r\n\r\nNative scholars, with their endless critiques and appreciations of\r\nindividual works, do not seem ever to have contemplated anything of the\r\nkind, realising, no doubt, the utter hopelessness, from a Chinese point\r\nof view, of achieving even comparative success in a general historical\r\nsurvey of the subject. The voluminous character of a literature which\r\nwas already in existence some six centuries before the Christian era,\r\nand has run on uninterruptedly until the present date, may well have\r\ngiven pause to writers aiming at completeness. The foreign student,\r\nhowever, is on a totally different footing. It may be said without\r\noffence that a work which would be inadequate to the requirements of\r\na native public, may properly be submitted to English readers as an\r\nintroduction into the great field which lies beyond.\r\n\r\nActing upon the suggestion of Mr. Gosse, to whom I am otherwise\r\nindebted for many valuable hints, I have devoted a large portion of\r\nthis book to translation, thus enabling the Chinese author, so far as\r\ntranslation will allow, to speak for himself. I have also added, here\r\nand there, remarks by native critics, that the reader may be able to\r\nform an idea of the point of view from which the Chinese judge their\r\nown productions.\r\n\r\nIt only remains to be stated that the translations, with the exception\r\nof a few passages from Legge’s “Chinese Classics,” in each case duly\r\nacknowledged, are my own.\r\n\r\n  HERBERT A.

There was first of all a period when Nothing\r\nexisted, though some enthusiasts have attempted to deal with a period\r\nantecedent even to that. Gradually Nothing took upon itself the form\r\nand limitations of Unity, represented by a point at the centre of\r\na circle. Thus there was a Great Monad, a First Cause, an Aura, a\r\nZeitgeist, or whatever one may please to call it.\r\n\r\nAfter countless ages, spent apparently in doing nothing, this Monad\r\nsplit into Two Principles, one active, the other passive; one\r\npositive, the other negative; light and darkness; male and female. The\r\ninteraction of these Two Principles resulted in the production of all\r\nthings, as we see them in the universe around us, 2,269,381 years ago.\r\nSuch is the cosmogony of the Chinese in a nutshell.\r\n\r\nThe more sober Chinese historians, however, are content to begin with a\r\nsufficiently mythical emperor, who reigned only 2800 years before the\r\nChristian era. The practice of agriculture, the invention of wheeled\r\nvehicles, and the simpler arts of early civilisation are generally\r\nreferred to this period; but to the dispassionate European student it\r\nis a period of myth and legend: in fact, we know very little about\r\nit. Neither do we know much, in the historical sense, of the numerous\r\nrulers whose names and dates appear in the chronology of the succeeding\r\ntwo thousand years. It is not indeed until we reach the eighth century\r\nB.C. that anything like history can be said to begin.\r\n\r\nFor reasons which will presently be made plain, the sixth century\r\nB.C. is a convenient starting-point for the student of Chinese\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FEUDALISM]\r\n\r\nChina was then confined to a comparatively small area, lying for the\r\nmost part between the Yellow River on the north and the river Yang-tsze\r\non the south. No one knows where the Chinese came from. Some hold the\r\nfascinating theory that they were emigrants from Accadia in the ancient\r\nkingdom of Babylonia; others have identified them with the lost tribes\r\nof Israel. No one seems to think they can possibly have originated in\r\nthe fertile plains where they are now found. It appears indeed to be\r\nan ethnological axiom that every race must have come from somewhere\r\noutside its own territory. However that may be, the China of the eighth\r\ncentury B.C. consisted of a number of Feudal States, ruled by nobles\r\nowning allegiance to a Central State, at the head of which was a king.\r\nThe outward tokens of subjection were homage and tribute; but after\r\nall, the allegiance must have been more nominal than real, each State\r\nbeing practically an independent kingdom. This condition of things\r\nwas the cause of much mutual jealousy, and often of bloody warfare,\r\nseveral of the States hating one another quite as cordially as Athens\r\nand Sparta at their best.\r\n\r\nThere was, notwithstanding, considerable physical civilisation in the\r\nancient States of those early days. Their citizens, when not employed\r\nin cutting each other’s throats, enjoyed a reasonable security of life\r\nand property. They lived in well-built houses; they dressed in silk\r\nor homespun; they wore shoes of leather; they carried umbrellas; they\r\nsat on chairs and used tables; they rode in carts and chariots; they\r\ntravelled by boat; and they ate their food off plates and dishes of\r\npottery, coarse perhaps, yet still superior to the wooden trencher\r\ncommon not so very long ago in Europe. They measured time by the\r\nsundial, and in the Golden Age they had the two famous calendar trees,\r\nrepresentations of which have come down to us in sculpture, dating\r\nfrom about A.D. 150. One of these trees put forth a leaf every day for\r\nfifteen days, after which a leaf fell off daily for fifteen more days.\r\nThe other put forth a leaf once a month for half a year, after which a\r\nleaf fell off monthly for a similar period. With these trees growing in\r\nthe courtyard, it was possible to say at a glance what was the day of\r\nthe month, and what was the month of the year. But civilisation proved\r\nunfavourable to their growth, and the species became extinct.\r\n\r\nIn the sixth century B.C. the Chinese were also in possession\r\nof a written language, fully adequate to the most varied expression of\r\nhuman thought, and indeed almost identical with their present script,\r\nallowing, among other things, for certain modifications of form brought\r\nabout by the substitution of paper and a camel’s-hair brush for the\r\nbamboo tablet and stylus of old. The actual stages by which that point\r\nwas reached are so far unknown to us. China has her Cadmus in the\r\nperson of a prehistoric individual named Ts‘ang Chieh, who is said to\r\nhave had four eyes, and to have taken the idea of a written language\r\nfrom the markings of birds’ claws upon the sand. Upon the achievement\r\nof his task the sky rained grain and evil spirits mourned by night.\r\nPrevious to this mankind had no other system than rude methods of\r\nknotting cords and notching sticks for noting events or communicating\r\nwith one another at a distance.\r\n\r\nAs to the origin of the written language of China, invention is\r\naltogether out of the question. It seems probable that in prehistoric\r\nages, the Chinese, like other peoples, began to make rude pictures of\r\nthe sun, moon, and stars, of man himself, of trees, of fire, of rain,\r\nand they appear to have followed these up by ideograms of various\r\nkinds. How far they went in this direction we can only surmise. There\r\nare comparatively few obviously pictorial characters and ideograms\r\nto be found even in the script of two thousand years ago; but\r\ninvestigations carried on for many years by Mr. L. C. Hopkins, H.M.\r\nConsul, Chefoo, and now approaching completion, point more and more\r\nto the fact that the written language will some day be recognised as\r\nsystematically developed from pictorial symbols. It is, at any rate,\r\ncertain that at a very early date subsequent to the legendary period\r\nof “knotted cords” and “notches,” while the picture-symbols were still\r\ncomparatively few, some master-mind reached at a bound the phonetic\r\nprinciple, from which point the rapid development of a written language\r\nsuch as we now find would be an easy matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nCONFUCIUS--THE FIVE CLASSICS\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BOOK OF HISTORY]\r\n\r\nIn B.C. 551 CONFUCIUS was born. He may be regarded as the founder of\r\nChinese literature. During his years of office as a Government servant\r\nand his years of teaching and wandering as an exile, he found time\r\nto rescue for posterity certain valuable literary fragments of great\r\nantiquity, and to produce at least one original work of his own.\r\nIt is impossible to assert that before his time there was anything\r\nin the sense of what we understand by the term general literature.\r\nThe written language appears to have been used chiefly for purposes\r\nof administration. Many utterances, however, of early, not to say\r\nlegendary, rulers had been committed to writing at one time or another,\r\nand such of these as were still extant were diligently collected and\r\nedited by Confucius, forming what is now known as the _Shu Ching_ or\r\nBook of History. The documents of which this work is composed are\r\nsaid to have been originally one hundred in all, and they cover a\r\nperiod extending from the twenty-fourth to the eighth century B.C.\r\nThey give us glimpses of an age earlier than that of Confucius, if not\r\nactually so early as is claimed. The first two, for instance, refer to\r\nthe Emperors Yao and Shun, whose reigns, extending from B.C. 2357 to\r\n2205, are regarded as the Golden Age of China. We read how the former\r\nmonarch “united the various parts of his domain in bonds of peace, so\r\nthat concord reigned among the black-haired people.” He abdicated in\r\nfavour of Shun, who is described as being profoundly wise, intelligent,\r\nand sincere. We are further told that Shun was chosen because of his\r\ngreat filial piety, which enabled him to live in harmony with an\r\nunprincipled father, a shifty stepmother, and an arrogant half-brother,\r\nand, moreover, to effect by his example a comparative reformation of\r\ntheir several characters.\r\n\r\nWe next come to a very famous personage, who founded the Hsia dynasty\r\nin B.C. 2205, and is known as the Great Yü. It was he who, during the\r\nreign of the Emperor Shun, successfully coped with a devastating flood,\r\nwhich has been loosely identified with the Noachic Deluge, and in\r\nreference to which it was said in the _Tso Chuan_, “How grand was the\r\nachievement of Yü, how far-reaching his glorious energy! But for Yü we\r\nshould all have been fishes.” The following is his own account (Legge’s\r\ntranslation):--\r\n\r\n“The inundating waters seemed to assail the heavens, and in their vast\r\nextent embraced the mountains and overtopped the hills, so that people\r\nwere bewildered and overwhelmed. I mounted my four conveyances (carts,\r\nboats, sledges, and spiked shoes), and all along the hills hewed down\r\nthe woods, at the same time, along with Yi, showing the multitudes how\r\nto get flesh to eat. I opened passages for the streams throughout the\r\nnine provinces, and conducted them to the sea. I deepened the channels\r\nand canals, and conducted them to the streams, at the same time, along\r\nwith Chi, sowing grain, and showing the multitudes how to procure\r\nthe food of toil in addition to flesh meat. I urged them further to\r\nexchange what they had for what they had not, and to dispose of their\r\naccumulated stores. In this way all the people got grain to eat, and\r\nall the States began to come under good rule.”\r\n\r\nA small portion of the Book of History is in verse:--\r\n\r\n  “_The people should be cherished,\r\n  And should not be downtrodden.\r\n  The people are the root of a country,\r\n  And if the root is firm, the country will be tranquil._\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _The palace a wild for lust,\r\n  The country a wild for hunting,\r\n  Rich wine, seductive music,\r\n  Lofty roofs, carved walls,--\r\n  Given any one of these,\r\n  And the result can only be ruin._”\r\n\r\nFrom the date of the foundation of the Hsia dynasty the throne of the\r\nempire was transmitted from father to son, and there were no more\r\nabdications in favour of virtuous sages. The fourth division of the\r\nBook of History deals with the decadence of the Hsia rulers and their\r\nfinal displacement in B.C. 1766 by T‘ang the Completer, founder of the\r\nShang dynasty. By B.C. 1122, the Shang sovereigns had similarly lapsed\r\nfrom the kingly qualities of their founder to even a lower level of\r\ndegradation and vice. Then arose one of the purest and most venerated\r\nheroes of Chinese history, popularly known by his canonisation as\r\nWên Wang. He was hereditary ruler of a principality in the modern\r\nprovince of Shensi, and in B.C. 1144 he was denounced as dangerous to\r\nthe throne. He was seized and thrown into prison, where he passed two\r\nyears, occupying himself with the Book of Changes, to which we shall\r\npresently return. At length the Emperor, yielding to the entreaties of\r\nthe people, backed up by the present of a beautiful concubine and some\r\nfine horses, set him at liberty and commissioned him to make war upon\r\nthe frontier tribes. To his dying day he never ceased to remonstrate\r\nagainst the cruelty and corruption of the age, and his name is still\r\nregarded as one of the most glorious in the annals of the empire. It\r\nwas reserved for his son, known as Wu Wang, to overthrow the Shang\r\ndynasty and mount the throne as first sovereign of the Chou dynasty,\r\nwhich was to last for eight centuries to come. The following is a\r\nspeech by the latter before a great assembly of nobles who were siding\r\nagainst the House of Shang. It is preserved among others in the Book of\r\nHistory, and is assigned to the year B.C. 1133 (Legge’s translation):--\r\n\r\n“Heaven and Earth are the parents of all creatures; and of all\r\ncreatures man is the most highly endowed. The sincere, intelligent,\r\nand perspicacious among men becomes the great sovereign, and the great\r\nsovereign is the parent of the people. But now, Shou, the king of\r\nShang, does not reverence Heaven above, and inflicts calamities on the\r\npeople below. He has been abandoned to drunkenness, and reckless in\r\nlust. He has dared to exercise cruel oppression. Along with criminals\r\nhe has punished all their relatives. He has put men into office on\r\nthe hereditary principle. He has made it his pursuit to have palaces,\r\ntowers, pavilions, embankments, ponds, and all other extravagances,\r\nto the most painful injury of you, the myriad people. He has burned\r\nand roasted the loyal and good. He has ripped up pregnant women. Great\r\nHeaven was moved with indignation, and charged my deceased father, Wên,\r\nreverently to display its majesty; but he died before the work was\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\n“On this account I, Fa, who am but a little child, have, by means\r\nof you, the hereditary rulers of my friendly States, contemplated\r\nthe government of Shang; but Shou has no repentant heart. He abides\r\nsquatting on his heels, not serving God or the spirits of heaven and\r\nearth, neglecting also the temple of his ancestors, and not sacrificing\r\nin it. The victims and the vessels of millet all become the prey of\r\nwicked robbers; and still he says, ‘The people are mine: the decree is\r\nmine,’ never trying to correct his contemptuous mind. Now Heaven, to\r\nprotect the inferior people, made for them rulers, and made for them\r\ninstructors, that they might be able to be aiding to God, and secure\r\nthe tranquillity of the four quarters of the empire. In regard to who\r\nare criminals and who are not, how dare I give any allowance to my own\r\nwishes?\r\n\r\n“‘Where the strength is the same, measure the virtue of the parties;\r\nwhere the virtue is the same, measure their righteousness.’ Shou has\r\nhundreds of thousands and myriads of ministers, but they have hundreds\r\nof thousands and myriads of minds; I have three thousand ministers, but\r\nthey have one mind. The iniquity of Shang is full. Heaven gives command\r\nto destroy it. If I did not comply with Heaven, my iniquity would be as\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\n“I, who am a little child, early and late am filled with apprehensions.\r\nI have received charge from my deceased father, Wên; I have offered\r\nspecial sacrifice to God; I have performed the due services to the\r\ngreat Earth; and I lead the multitude of you to execute the punishment\r\nappointed by Heaven. Heaven compassionates the people. What the people\r\ndesire, Heaven will be found to give effect to. Do you aid me, the one\r\nman, to cleanse for ever all within the four seas. Now is the time!--it\r\nmay not be lost.”\r\n\r\nTwo of the documents which form the Book of History are directed\r\nagainst luxury and drunkenness, to both of which the people seemed\r\nlikely to give way even within measurable distance of the death of Wên\r\nWang. The latter had enacted that wine (that is to say, ardent spirits\r\ndistilled from rice) should only be used on sacrificial occasions, and\r\nthen under strict supervision; and it is laid down, almost as a general\r\nprinciple, that all national misfortunes, culminating in the downfall\r\nof a dynasty, may be safely ascribed to the abuse of wine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE ODES]\r\n\r\nThe _Shih Ching_, or Book of Odes, is another work for the preservation\r\nof which we are indebted to Confucius. It consists of a collection\r\nof rhymed ballads in various metres, usually four words to the line,\r\ncomposed between the reign of the Great Yü and the beginning of the\r\nsixth century B.C. These, which now number 305, are popularly known\r\nas the “Three Hundred,” and are said by some to have been selected\r\nby Confucius from no less than 3000 pieces. They are arranged under\r\nfour heads, as follows:--(_a_) Ballads commonly sung by the people in\r\nthe various feudal States and forwarded periodically by the nobles to\r\ntheir suzerain, the Son of Heaven. The ballads were then submitted\r\nto the Imperial Musicians, who were able to judge from the nature of\r\nsuch compositions what would be the manners and customs prevailing\r\nin each State, and to advise the suzerain accordingly as to the good\r\nor evil administration of each of his vassal rulers. (_b_) Odes sung\r\nat ordinary entertainments given by the suzerain. (_c_) Odes sung on\r\ngrand occasions when the feudal nobles were gathered together. (_d_)\r\nPanegyrics and sacrificial odes.\r\n\r\nConfucius himself attached the utmost importance to his labours in this\r\ndirection. “Have you learned the Odes?” he inquired upon one occasion\r\nof his son; and on receiving an answer in the negative, immediately\r\ntold the youth that until he did so he would be unfit for the society\r\nof intellectual men. Confucius may indeed be said to have anticipated\r\nthe apophthegm attributed by Fletcher of Saltoun to a “very wise man,”\r\nnamely, that he who should be allowed to make a nation’s “ballads need\r\ncare little who made its laws.” And it was probably this appreciation\r\nby Confucius that gave rise to an extraordinary literary craze in\r\nreference to these Odes. Early commentators, incapable of seeing the\r\nsimple natural beauties of the poems, which have furnished endless\r\nhousehold words and a large stock of phraseology to the language of\r\nthe present day, and at the same time unable to ignore the deliberate\r\njudgment of the Master, set to work to read into countryside ditties\r\ndeep moral and political significations. Every single one of the\r\nimmortal Three Hundred has thus been forced to yield some hidden\r\nmeaning and point an appropriate moral. If a maiden warns her lover not\r\nto be too rash--\r\n\r\n      “_Don’t come in, sir, please!\r\n      Don’t break my willow-trees!\r\n      Not that that would very much grieve me;\r\n  But alack-a-day! what would my parents say?\r\n      And love you as I may,\r\n  I cannot bear to think what that would be,_”--\r\n\r\ncommentators promptly discover that the piece refers to a feudal noble\r\nwhose brother had been plotting against him, and to the excuses of the\r\nformer for not visiting the latter with swift and exemplary punishment.\r\n\r\nAnother independent young lady may say--\r\n\r\n  “_If you will love me dear, my lord,\r\n  I’ll pick up my skirts and cross the ford,\r\n  But if from your heart you turn me out ...\r\n  Well, you’re not the only man about,\r\n  You silly, silly, silliest lout!_”--\r\n\r\nstill commentaries are not wanting to show that these straightforward\r\nwords express the wish of the people of a certain small State that\r\nsome great State would intervene and put an end to an existing feud in\r\nthe ruling family. Native scholars are, of course, hide-bound in the\r\ntraditions of commentators, but European students will do well to seek\r\nthe meaning of the Odes within the compass of the Odes themselves.\r\n\r\nPossibly the very introduction of these absurdities may have helped to\r\npreserve to our day a work which would otherwise have been considered\r\ntoo trivial to merit the attention of scholars. Chinese who are in\r\nthe front rank of scholarship know it by heart, and each separate\r\npiece has been searchingly examined, until the force of exegesis can\r\nno farther go. There is one famous line which runs, according to the\r\naccepted commentary, “The muddiness of the Ching river appears from\r\nthe (clearness of the) Wei river.” In 1790 the Emperor Ch‘ien Lung,\r\ndissatisfied with this interpretation, sent a viceroy to examine the\r\nrivers. The latter reported that the Ching was really clear and the Wei\r\nmuddy, so that the wording of the line must mean “The Ching river is\r\nmade muddy by the Wei river.”\r\n\r\nThe following is a specimen of one of the longer of the Odes, saddled,\r\nlike all the rest, with an impossible political interpretation, of\r\nwhich nothing more need be said:--\r\n\r\n  “_You seemed a guileless youth enough,\r\n  Offering for silk your woven stuff;[1]\r\n  But silk was not required by you;\r\n  I was the silk you had in view.\r\n  With you I crossed the ford, and while\r\n  We wandered on for many a mile\r\n  I said, ‘I do not wish delay,\r\n  But friends must fix our wedding-day ...\r\n  Oh, do not let my words give pain,\r\n  But with the autumn come again.’_\r\n\r\n  “_And then I used to watch and wait\r\n  To see you passing through the gate;\r\n  And sometimes, when I watched in vain,\r\n  My tears would flow like falling rain;\r\n  But when I saw my darling boy,\r\n  I laughed and cried aloud for joy.\r\n  The fortune-tellers, you declared,\r\n  Had all pronounced us duly paired;\r\n  ‘Then bring a carriage,’ I replied,\r\n  ‘And I’ll away to be your bride.’_\r\n\r\n  “_The mulberry-leaf, not yet undone\r\n  By autumn chill, shines in the sun.\r\n  O tender dove, I would advise,\r\n  Beware the fruit that tempts thy eyes!\r\n  O maiden fair, not yet a spouse,\r\n  List lightly not to lovers’ vows!\r\n  A man may do this wrong, and time\r\n  Will fling its shadow o’er his crime;\r\n  A woman who has lost her name\r\n  Is doomed to everlasting shame._\r\n\r\n  “_The mulberry-tree upon the ground\r\n  Now sheds its yellow leaves around.\r\n  Three years have slipped away from me\r\n  Since first I shared your poverty;\r\n  And now again, alas the day!\r\n  Back through the ford I take my way.\r\n  My heart is still unchanged, but you\r\n  Have uttered words now proved untrue;\r\n  And you have left me to deplore\r\n  A love that can be mine no more._\r\n\r\n  “_For three long years I was your wife,\r\n  And led in truth a toilsome life;\r\n  Early to rise and late to bed,\r\n  Each day alike passed o’er my head.\r\n  I honestly fulfilled my part,\r\n  And you--well, you have broke my heart.\r\n  The truth my brothers will not know,\r\n  So all the more their gibes will flow.\r\n  I grieve in silence and repine\r\n  That such a wretched fate is mine._\r\n\r\n  “_Ah, hand in hand to face old age!--\r\n  Instead, I turn a bitter page.\r\n  O for the river-banks of yore;\r\n  O for the much-loved marshy shore;\r\n  The hours of girlhood, with my hair\r\n  Ungathered, as we lingered there.\r\n  The words we spoke, that seemed so true,\r\n  I little thought that I should rue;\r\n  I little thought the vows we swore\r\n  Would some day bind us two no more._”\r\n\r\nMany of the Odes deal with warfare, and with the separation of wives\r\nfrom their husbands; others, with agriculture and with the chase,\r\nwith marriage and feasting. The ordinary sorrows of life are fully\r\nrepresented, and to these may be added frequent complaints against\r\nthe harshness of officials, one speaker going so far as to wish he\r\nwere a tree without consciousness, without home, and without family.\r\nThe old-time theme of “eat, drink, and be merry” is brought out as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  “_You have coats and robes,\r\n  But you do not trail them;\r\n  You have chariots and horses,\r\n  But you do not ride in them.\r\n  By and by you will die,\r\n  And another will enjoy them._\r\n\r\n  “_You have courtyards and halls,\r\n  But they are not sprinkled and swept;\r\n  You have bells and drums,\r\n  But they are not struck.\r\n  By and by you will die,\r\n  And another will possess them._\r\n\r\n  “_You have wine and food;\r\n  Why not play daily on your lute,\r\n  That you may enjoy yourself now\r\n  And lengthen your days?\r\n  By and by you will die,\r\n  And another will take your place._”\r\n\r\nThe Odes are especially valuable for the insight they give us into the\r\nmanners, and customs, and beliefs of the Chinese before the age of\r\nConfucius. How far back they extend it is quite impossible to say. An\r\neclipse of the sun, “an event of evil omen,” is mentioned in one of the\r\nOdes as a recent occurrence on a certain day which works out as the\r\n29th August, B.C. 775; and this eclipse has been verified for\r\nthat date. The following lines are from Legge’s rendering of this Ode:--\r\n\r\n  “_The sun and moon announce evil,\r\n  Not keeping to their proper paths.\r\n  All through the kingdom there is no proper government,\r\n  Because the good are not employed.\r\n  For the moon to be eclipsed\r\n  Is but an ordinary matter.\r\n  Now that the sun has been eclipsed,\r\n  How bad it is!_”\r\n\r\nThe rainbow was regarded, not as a portent of evil, but as an improper\r\ncombination of the dual forces of nature,--\r\n\r\n  “_There is a rainbow in the east,\r\n  And no one dares point at it,_”--\r\n\r\nand is applied figuratively to women who form improper connections.\r\n\r\nThe position of women generally seems to have been very much what it\r\nis at the present day. In an Ode which describes the completion of a\r\npalace for one of the ancient princes, we are conducted through the\r\nrooms,--\r\n\r\n  “_Here will he live, here will he sit,\r\n  Here will he laugh, here will he talk,_”--\r\n\r\nuntil we come to the bedchamber, where he will awake, and call upon\r\nthe chief diviner to interpret his dream of bears and serpents. The\r\ninterpretation (Legge) is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  “_Sons shall be born to him:--\r\n  They will be put to sleep on couches;\r\n  They will be clothed in robes;\r\n  They will have sceptres to play with;\r\n  Their cry will be loud.\r\n  They will be resplendent with red knee-covers,\r\n  The future princes of the land._\r\n\r\n  “_Daughters shall be born to him:--\r\n  They will be put to sleep on the ground;\r\n  They will be clothed with wrappers;\r\n  They will have tiles to play with.\r\n  It will be theirs neither to do wrong nor to do good.\r\n  Only about the spirits and the food will they have to think,\r\n  And to cause no sorrow to their parents._”\r\n\r\nThe distinction thus drawn is severe enough, and it is quite\r\nunnecessary to make a comparison, as some writers on China have done,\r\nbetween the tile and the sceptre, as though the former were but a dirty\r\npotsherd, good enough for a girl. A tile was used in the early ages\r\nas a weight for the spindle, and is here used merely to indicate the\r\ndirection which a girl’s activities should take.\r\n\r\nWomen are further roughly handled in an Ode which traces the prevailing\r\nmisgovernment to their interference in affairs of State and in matters\r\nwhich do not lie within their province:--\r\n\r\n  “_A clever man builds a city,\r\n  A clever woman lays one low;\r\n  With all her qualifications, that clever woman\r\n  Is but an ill-omened bird.\r\n  A woman with a long tongue\r\n  Is a flight of steps leading to calamity;\r\n  For disorder does not come from heaven,\r\n  But is brought about by women.\r\n  Among those who cannot be trained or taught\r\n  Are women and eunuchs._”\r\n\r\nAbout seventy kinds of plants are mentioned in the Odes, including the\r\nbamboo, barley, beans, convolvulus, dodder, dolichos, hemp, indigo,\r\nliquorice, melon, millet, peony, pepper, plantain, scallions, sorrel,\r\nsowthistle, tribulus, and wheat; about thirty kinds of trees, including\r\nthe cedar, cherry, chestnut, date, hazel, medlar, mulberry, oak, peach,\r\npear, plum, and willow; about thirty kinds of animals, including the\r\nantelope, badger, bear, boar, elephant, fox, leopard, monkey, rat,\r\nrhinoceros, tiger, and wolf; about thirty kinds of birds, including\r\nthe crane, eagle, egret, magpie, oriole, swallow, and wagtail; about\r\nten kinds of fishes, including the barbel, bream, carp, and tench; and\r\nabout twenty kinds of insects, including the ant, cicada, glow-worm,\r\nlocust, spider, and wasp.\r\n\r\nAmong the musical instruments of the Odes are found the flute, the\r\ndrum, the bell, the lute, and the Pandæan pipes; among the metals\r\nare gold and iron, with an indirect allusion to silver and copper;\r\nand among the arms and munitions of war are bows and arrows, spears,\r\nswords, halberds, armour, grappling-hooks, towers on wheels for use\r\nagainst besieged cities, and gags for soldiers’ mouths, to prevent them\r\ntalking in the ranks on the occasion of night attacks.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a Supreme Being is brought out very fully in the Odes--\r\n\r\n  “_Great is God,\r\n  Ruling in majesty._”\r\n\r\nAlso,\r\n\r\n  “_How mighty is God,\r\n  The Ruler of mankind!\r\n  How terrible is His majesty!_”\r\n\r\nHe is apparently in the form of man, for in one place we read of His\r\nfootprint. He hates the oppression of great States, although in another\r\npassage we read--\r\n\r\n  “_Behold Almighty God;\r\n  Who is there whom He hates?_”\r\n\r\nHe comforts the afflicted. He is free from error. His “Way” is hard to\r\nfollow. He is offended by sin. He can be appeased by sacrifice:--\r\n\r\n  “_We fill the sacrificial vessels with offerings,\r\n  Both the vessels of wood, and those of earthenware.\r\n  Then when the fragrance is borne on high,\r\n  God smells the savour and is pleased._”\r\n\r\nOne more quotation, which, in deference to space limits, must be the\r\nlast, exhibits the husbandman of early China in a very pleasing light:--\r\n\r\n  “_The clouds form in dense masses,\r\n  And the rain falls softly down.\r\n  Oh, may it first water the public lands,\r\n  And then come to our private fields!\r\n  Here shall some corn be left standing,\r\n  Here some sheaves unbound;\r\n  Here some handfuls shall be dropped,\r\n  And there some neglected ears;\r\n  These are for the benefit of the widow._”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BOOK OF CHANGES]\r\n\r\nThe next of the pre-Confucian works, and possibly the oldest of all, is\r\nthe famous _I Ching_, or Book of Changes. It is ascribed to WÊN WANG,\r\nthe virtual founder of the Chou dynasty, whose son, WU WANG, became the\r\nfirst sovereign of a long line, extending from B.C. 1122 to B.C. 249.\r\nIt contains a fanciful system of philosophy, deduced originally from\r\nEight Diagrams consisting of triplet combinations or arrangements of a\r\nline and a divided line, either one or other of which is necessarily\r\nrepeated twice, and in two cases three times, in the same combination.\r\nThus there may be three lines ☰, or three divided lines ☷, a divided\r\nline above or below two lines ☱ ☴, a divided line between two lines\r\n☲, and so on, eight in all. These so-called diagrams are said to have\r\nbeen invented two thousand years and more before Christ by the monarch\r\nFu Hsi, who copied them from the back of a tortoise. He subsequently\r\nincreased the above simple combinations to sixty-four double ones, on\r\nthe permutations of which are based the philosophical speculations of\r\nthe Book of Changes. Each diagram represents some power in nature,\r\neither active or passive, such as fire, water, thunder, earth, and so\r\non.\r\n\r\nThe text consists of sixty-four short essays, enigmatically and\r\nsymbolically expressed, on important themes, mostly of a moral, social,\r\nand political character, and based upon the same number of lineal\r\nfigures, each made up of six lines, some of which are whole and the\r\nothers divided. The text is followed by commentaries, called the Ten\r\nWings, probably of a later date and commonly ascribed to Confucius, who\r\ndeclared that were a hundred years added to his life he would devote\r\nfifty of them to a study of the _I Ching_.\r\n\r\nThe following is a specimen (Legge’s translation):--\r\n\r\n“_Text._ ䷉ This suggests the idea of one treading on the tail of a\r\ntiger, which does not bite him. There will be progress and success.\r\n\r\n“1. The first line, undivided, shows its subject treading his\r\naccustomed path. If he go forward, there will be no error.\r\n\r\n“2. The second line, undivided, shows its subject treading the path\r\nthat is level and easy;--a quiet and solitary man, to whom, if he be\r\nfirm and correct, there will be good fortune.\r\n\r\n“3. The third line, divided, shows a one-eyed man who thinks he can\r\nsee; a lame man who thinks he can walk well; one who treads on the tail\r\nof a tiger and is bitten. All this indicates ill-fortune. We have a\r\nmere bravo acting the part of a great ruler.\r\n\r\n“4. The fourth line, undivided, shows its subject treading on the tail\r\nof a tiger. He becomes full of apprehensive caution, and in the end\r\nthere will be good fortune.\r\n\r\n“5. The fifth line, undivided, shows the resolute tread of its subject.\r\nThough he be firm and correct, there will be peril.\r\n\r\n“6. The sixth line, undivided, tells us to look at the whole course\r\nthat is trodden, and examine the presage which that gives. If it be\r\ncomplete and without failure, there will be great good fortune.\r\n\r\n“_Wing._--In this hexagram we have the symbol of weakness treading on\r\nthat of strength.\r\n\r\n“The lower trigram indicates pleasure and satisfaction, and responds\r\nto the upper indicating strength. Hence it is said, ‘He treads on the\r\ntail of a tiger, which does not bite him; there will be progress and\r\nsuccess.’\r\n\r\n“The fifth line is strong, in the centre, and in its correct place. Its\r\nsubject occupies the God-given position, and falls into no distress or\r\nfailure;--his action will be brilliant.”\r\n\r\nAs may be readily inferred from the above extract, no one really\r\nknows what is meant by the apparent gibberish of the Book of Changes.\r\nThis is freely admitted by all learned Chinese, who nevertheless hold\r\ntenaciously to the belief that important lessons could be derived from\r\nits pages if we only had the wit to understand them. Foreigners have\r\nheld various theories on the subject. Dr. Legge declared that he had\r\nfound the key, with the result already shown. The late Terrien de la\r\nCouperie took a bolder flight, unaccompanied by any native commentator,\r\nand discovered in this cherished volume a vocabulary of the language of\r\nthe Bák tribes. A third writer regards it as a calendar of the lunar\r\nyear, and so forth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BOOK OF RITES]\r\n\r\nThe _Li Chi_, or Book of Rites, seems to have been a compilation by\r\ntwo cousins, known as the Elder and the Younger TAI, who flourished in\r\nthe 2nd and 1st centuries B.C. From existing documents, said to have\r\nemanated from Confucius and his disciples, the Elder Tai prepared a\r\nwork in 85 sections on what may be roughly called social rites. The\r\nYounger Tai reduced these to 46 sections. Later scholars, such as Ma\r\nJung and Chêng Hsüan, left their mark upon the work, and it was not\r\nuntil near the close of the 2nd century A.D. that finality in this\r\ndirection was achieved. It then became known as a _Chi_ = Record, not\r\nas a _Ching_ = Text, the latter term being reserved by the orthodox\r\nsolely for such books as have reached us direct from the hands of\r\nConfucius. The following is an extract (Legge’s translation):--\r\n\r\nConfucius said: “Formerly, along with Lao Tan, I was assisting at a\r\nburial in the village of Hsiang, and when we had got to the path the\r\nsun was eclipsed. Lao Tan said to me, ‘Ch‘iu, let the bier be stopped\r\non the left of the road; and then let us wail and wait till the eclipse\r\npass away. When it is light again we will proceed.’ He said that this\r\nwas the rule. When we had returned and completed the burial, I said\r\nto him, ‘In the progress of a bier there should be no returning. When\r\nthere is an eclipse of the sun, we do not know whether it will pass\r\naway quickly or not; would it not have been better to go on?’ Lao Tan\r\nsaid, ‘When the prince of a state is going to the court of the Son of\r\nHeaven, he travels while he can see the sun. At sundown he halts and\r\npresents his offerings (to the spirit of the way). When a great officer\r\nis on a mission, he travels while he can see the sun, and at sundown\r\nhe halts. Now a bier does not set forth in the early morning, nor\r\ndoes it rest anywhere at night; but those who travel by starlight are\r\nonly criminals and those who are hastening to the funeral rites of a\r\nparent.’”\r\n\r\nOther specimens will be found in Chapters iii. and iv.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUntil the time of the Ming dynasty, A.D. 1368, another and\r\na much older work, known as the _Chou Li_, or Rites of the Chou\r\ndynasty, and dealing more with constitutional matters, was always\r\ncoupled with the _Li Chi_, and formed one of the then recognised Six\r\nClassics. There is still a third work of the same class, and also of\r\nconsiderable antiquity, called the _I Li_. Its contents treat mostly of\r\nthe ceremonial observances of everyday life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE SPRING AND AUTUMN]\r\n\r\nWe now come to the last of the Five Classics as at present constituted,\r\nthe _Ch‘un Ch‘iu_, or Spring and Autumn Annals. This is a chronological\r\nrecord of the chief events in the State of Lu between the years B.C.\r\n722-484, and is generally regarded as the work of Confucius, whose\r\nnative State was Lu. The entries are of the briefest, and comprise\r\nnotices of incursions, victories, defeats, deaths, murders, treaties,\r\nand natural phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe following are a few illustrative extracts:--\r\n\r\n“In the 7th year of Duke Chao, in spring, the Northern Yen State made\r\npeace with the Ch‘i State.\r\n\r\n“In the 3rd month the Duke visited the Ch‘u State.\r\n\r\n“In summer, on the _chia shên_ day of the 4th month (March 11th,\r\nB.C. 594), the sun was eclipsed.\r\n\r\n“In the 7th year of Duke Chuang (B.C. 685), in summer, in the\r\n4th moon, at midnight, there was a shower of stars like rain.”\r\n\r\nThe Spring and Autumn owes its name to the old custom of prefixing to\r\neach entry the year, month, day, and season when the event recorded\r\ntook place; spring, as a commentator explains, including summer, and\r\nautumn winter. It was the work which Confucius singled out as that\r\none by which men would know and commend him, and Mencius considered\r\nit quite as important an achievement as the draining of the empire\r\nby the Great Yü. The latter said, “Confucius completed the Spring\r\nand Autumn, and rebellious ministers and bad sons were struck with\r\nterror.” Consequently, just as in the case of the Odes, native wits\r\nset to work to read into the bald text all manner of hidden meanings,\r\neach entry being supposed to contain approval or condemnation, their\r\nefforts resulting in what is now known as the praise-and-blame theory.\r\nThe critics of the Han dynasty even went so far as to declare the\r\nvery title elliptical for “praise life-giving like spring, and blame\r\nlife-withering like autumn.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE TSO CHUAN]\r\n\r\nSuch is the _Ch‘un Ch‘iu_; and if that were all, it is difficult to say\r\nhow the boast of Confucius could ever have been fulfilled. But it is\r\nnot all; there is a saving clause. For bound up, so to speak, with the\r\nSpring and Autumn, and forming as it were an integral part of the work,\r\nis a commentary known as the _Tso Chuan_ or TSO’S Commentary.\r\nOf the writer himself, who has been canonised as the Father of Prose,\r\nand to whose pen has also been attributed the _Kuo Yü_ or Episodes of\r\nthe States, next to nothing is known, except that he was a disciple of\r\nConfucius; but his glowing narrative remains, and is likely to continue\r\nto remain, one of the most precious heirlooms of the Chinese people.\r\n\r\nWhat Tso did was this. He took the dry bones of these annals and\r\nclothed them with life and reality by adding a more or less complete\r\nsetting to each of the events recorded. He describes the loves and\r\nhates of the heroes, their battles, their treaties, their feastings,\r\nand their deaths, in a style which is always effective, and often\r\napproaches to grandeur. Circumstances of apparently the most trivial\r\ncharacter are expanded into interesting episodes, and every now and\r\nagain some quaint conceit or scrap of proverbial literature is thrown\r\nin to give a passing flavour of its own. Under the 21st year of Duke\r\nHsi, the Spring and Autumn has the following exiguous entry:--\r\n\r\n“In summer there was great drought.”\r\n\r\nTo this the _Tso Chuan_ adds--\r\n\r\n“In consequence of the drought the Duke wished to burn a witch. One of\r\nhis officers, however, said to him, ‘That will not affect the drought.\r\nRather repair your city walls and ramparts; eat less, and curtail your\r\nexpenditure; practise strict economy, and urge the people to help one\r\nanother. That is the essential; what have witches to do in the matter?\r\nIf God wishes her to be slain, it would have been better not to allow\r\nher to be born. If she can cause a drought, burning her will only\r\nmake things worse.’ The Duke took this advice, and during that year,\r\nalthough there was famine, it was not very severe.”\r\n\r\nUnder the 12th year of Duke Hsüan the Spring and Autumn says--\r\n\r\n“In spring the ruler of the Ch‘u State besieged the capital of the\r\nChêng State.”\r\n\r\nThereupon the _Tso Chuan_ adds a long account of the whole business,\r\nfrom which the following typical paragraph is extracted:--\r\n\r\n“In the rout which followed, a war-chariot of the Chin State stuck in\r\na deep rut and could not get on. Thereupon a man of the Ch‘u State\r\nadvised the charioteer to take out the stand for arms. This eased it a\r\nlittle, but again the horses turned round. The man then advised that\r\nthe flagstaff should be taken out and used as a lever, and at last the\r\nchariot was extricated. ‘Ah,’ said the charioteer to the man of Ch‘u,\r\n‘we don’t know so much about running away as the people of your worthy\r\nState.’”\r\n\r\nThe _Tso Chuan_ contains several interesting passages on music,\r\nwhich was regarded by Confucius as an important factor in the art of\r\ngovernment, recalling the well-known views of Plato in Book III. of\r\nhis _Republic_. Apropos of disease, we read that “the ancient rulers\r\nregulated all things by music.” Also that “the superior man will not\r\nlisten to lascivious or seductive airs;” “he addresses himself to his\r\nlute in order to regulate his conduct, and not to delight his heart.”\r\n\r\nWhen the rabid old anti-foreign tutor of the late Emperor T‘ung Chih\r\nwas denouncing the barbarians, and expressing a kindly desire to “sleep\r\non their skins,” he was quoting the phraseology of the _Tso Chuan_.\r\n\r\nOne hero, on going into battle, told his friends that he should only\r\nhear the drum beating the signal to advance, for he would take good\r\ncare not to hear the gong sounding the retreat. Another made each of\r\nhis men carry into battle a long rope, seeing that the enemy all wore\r\ntheir hair short. In a third case, where some men in possession of\r\nboats were trying to prevent others from scrambling in, we are told\r\nthat the fingers of the assailants were chopped off in such large\r\nnumbers that they could be picked up in double handfuls.\r\n\r\nMany maxims, practical and unpractical, are to be found scattered over\r\nthe _Tso Chuan_, such as, “One day’s leniency to an enemy entails\r\ntrouble for many generations;” “Propriety forbids that a man should\r\nprofit himself at the expense of another;” “The receiver is as bad as\r\nthe thief;” “It is better to attack than to be attacked.”\r\n\r\nWhen the French fleet returned to Shanghai in 1885 after being repulsed\r\nin a shore attack at Tamsui, a local wit at once adapted a verse of\r\ndoggerel found in the _Tso Chuan_:--\r\n\r\n  “_See goggle-eyes and greedy-guts\r\n  Has left his shield among the ruts;\r\n  Back from the field, back from the field\r\n  He’s brought his beard, but not his shield;_”\r\n\r\nand for days every Chinaman was muttering the refrain--\r\n\r\n  “_Yü sai, yü sai\r\n  Ch‘i chia fu lai._”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: KU-LIANG AND KUNG-YANG]\r\n\r\nThere are two other commentaries on the Spring and Autumn, similar,\r\nbut generally regarded as inferior, to the _Tso Chuan_. They are by\r\nKU-LIANG and KUNG-YANG, both of the fifth century B.C. The following\r\nare specimens (Legge’s translation, omitting unimportant details):--\r\n\r\n_Text._--“In spring, in the king’s first month, the first day of the\r\nmoon, there fell stones in Sung--five of them. In the same month, six\r\nfish-hawks flew backwards, past the capital of Sung.”\r\n\r\n    The commentary of Ku-liang says, “Why does the text first say\r\n    “there fell,” and then “stones”? There was the falling, and then\r\n    the stones.\r\n\r\n    In “six fish-hawks flying backwards past the capital of Sung,”\r\n    the number is put first, indicating that the birds were collected\r\n    together. The language has respect to the seeing of the eyes.\r\n\r\n    The Master said, “Stones are things without any intelligence, and\r\n    fish-hawks creatures that have a little intelligence. The stones,\r\n    having no intelligence, are mentioned along with the day when\r\n    they fell, and the fish-hawks, having a little intelligence, are\r\n    mentioned along with the month when they appeared. The superior man\r\n    (Confucius) even in regard to such things and creatures records\r\n    nothing rashly. His expressions about stones and fish-hawks being\r\n    thus exact, how much more will they be so about men!”\r\n\r\n    The commentary of Kung-yang says, “How is it that the text first\r\n    says “there fell,” and then “stones”?\r\n\r\n    “There fell stones” is a record of what was heard. There was heard\r\n    a noise of something falling. On looking at what had fallen, it was\r\n    seen to be stones, On examination it was found there were five of\r\n    them.\r\n\r\n    Why does the text say “six,” and then “fish-hawks”?\r\n\r\n    “Six fish-hawks backwards flew” is a record of what was seen. When\r\n    they looked at the objects, there were six. When they examined\r\n    them, they were fish-hawks. When they examined them leisurely, they\r\n    were flying backwards.\r\n\r\nSometimes these commentaries are seriously at variance with that of\r\nTso. For instance, the text says that in B.C. 689 the ruler of the Chi\r\nState “made a great end of his State.” Tso’s commentary explains the\r\nwords to mean that for various urgent reasons the ruler abdicated.\r\nKung-yang, however, takes quite a different view. He explains the\r\npassage in the sense that the State in question was utterly destroyed,\r\nthe population being wiped out by the ruler of another State in revenge\r\nfor the death in B.C. 893 of an ancestor, who was boiled to death at\r\nthe feudal metropolis in consequence of slander by a contemporary\r\nruler of the Chi State. It is important for candidates at the public\r\nexaminations to be familiar with these discrepancies, as they are\r\nfrequently called upon to “discuss” such points, always with the object\r\nof establishing the orthodox and accepted interpretations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: KUNG-YANG CHUAN]\r\n\r\nThe following episode is from Kung-yang’s commentary, and is quite\r\ndifferent from the story told by Tso in reference to the same\r\npassage:--\r\n\r\n_Text._--“In summer, in the 5th month, the Sung State made peace with\r\nthe Ch‘u State.\r\n\r\n“In B.C. 587 King Chuang of Ch‘u was besieging the capital of\r\nSung. He had only rations for seven days, and if these were exhausted\r\nbefore he could take the city, he meant to withdraw. He therefore\r\nsent his general to climb the ramparts and spy out the condition of\r\nthe besieged. It chanced that at the same time an officer of the Sung\r\narmy came forth upon the ramparts, and the two met. ‘How is your State\r\ngetting on?’ inquired the general. ‘Oh, badly,’ replied the officer.\r\n‘We are reduced to exchanging children for food, and their bones are\r\nchopped up for fuel.’ ‘That is bad indeed,’ said the general; ‘I had\r\nheard, however, that the besieged, while feeding their horses with bits\r\nin their mouths, kept some fat ones for exhibition to strangers. What\r\na spirit is yours!’ To this the officer replied, ‘I too have heard\r\nthat the superior man, seeing another’s misfortune, is filled with\r\npity, while the ignoble man is filled with joy. And in you I recognise\r\nthe superior man; so I have told you our story.’ ‘Be of good cheer,’\r\nsaid the general. ‘We too have only seven days’ rations, and if we\r\ndo not conquer you in that time, we shall withdraw.’ He then bowed,\r\nand retired to report to his master. The latter said, ‘We must now\r\ncapture the city before we withdraw.’ ‘Not so,’ replied the general; ‘I\r\ntold the officer we had only rations for seven days.’ King Chuang was\r\ngreatly enraged at this; but the general said, ‘If a small State like\r\nSung has officers who speak the truth, should not the State of Ch‘u\r\nhave such men also?’ The king still wished to remain, but the general\r\nthreatened to leave him, and thus peace was brought about between the\r\ntwo States.”\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[1] Supposed to have been stamped pieces of linen, used as a\r\ncirculating medium before the invention of coins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE FOUR BOOKS--MENCIUS\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE LUN YÜ]\r\n\r\nNo Chinaman thinks of entering upon a study of the Five Classics until\r\nhe has mastered and committed to memory a shorter and simpler course\r\nknown as The Four Books.\r\n\r\nThe first of these, as generally arranged for students, is the _Lun\r\nYü_ or Analects, a work in twenty short chapters or books, retailing\r\nthe views of Confucius on a variety of subjects, and expressed so far\r\nas possible in the very words of the Master. It tells us nearly all we\r\nreally know about the Sage, and may possibly have been put together\r\nwithin a hundred years of his death. From its pages we seem to gather\r\nsome idea, a mere _silhouette_ perhaps, of the great moralist whose\r\nmission on earth was to teach duty towards one’s neighbour to his\r\nfellow-men, and who formulated the Golden Rule: “What you would not\r\nothers should do unto you, do not unto them!”\r\n\r\nIt has been urged by many, who should know better, that the negative\r\nform of this maxim is unfit to rank with the positive form as given to\r\nus by Christ. But of course the two are logically identical, as may\r\nbe shown by the simple insertion of the word “abstain;” that is, you\r\nwould not that others should abstain from certain actions in regard to\r\nyourself, which practically conveys the positive injunction.\r\n\r\nWhen a disciple asked Confucius to explain charity of heart, he replied\r\nsimply, “Love one another.” When, however, he was asked concerning the\r\nprinciple that good should be returned for evil, as already enunciated\r\nby Lao Tzŭ (see ch. iv.), he replied, “What then will you return for\r\ngood? No: return good for good; for evil, justice.”\r\n\r\nHe was never tired of emphasising the beauty and necessity of truth: “A\r\nman without truthfulness! I know not how that can be.”\r\n\r\n“Let loyalty and truth be paramount with you.”\r\n\r\n“In mourning, it is better to be sincere than punctilious.”\r\n\r\n“Man is born to be upright. If he be not so, and yet live, he is lucky\r\nto have escaped.”\r\n\r\n“Riches and honours are what men desire; yet except in accordance with\r\nright these may not be enjoyed.”\r\n\r\nConfucius undoubtedly believed in a Power, unseen and eternal, whom he\r\nvaguely addressed as Heaven: “He who has offended against Heaven has\r\nnone to whom he can pray.” “I do not murmur against Heaven,” and so\r\non. His greatest commentator, however, Chu Hsi, has explained that by\r\n“Heaven” is meant “Abstract Right,” and that interpretation is accepted\r\nby Confucianists at the present day. At the same time, Confucius\r\nstrongly objected to discuss the supernatural, and suggested that our\r\nduties are towards the living rather than towards the dead.\r\n\r\nHe laid the greatest stress upon filial piety, and taught that man is\r\nabsolutely pure at birth, and afterwards becomes depraved only because\r\nof his environment.\r\n\r\nChapter x. of the _Lun Yü_ gives some singular details of the every-day\r\nlife and habits of the Sage, calculated to provoke a smile among those\r\nwith whom reverence for Confucius has not been a first principle from\r\nthe cradle upwards, but received with loving gravity by the Chinese\r\npeople at large. The following are extracts (Legge’s translation) from\r\nthis famous chapter:--\r\n\r\n“Confucius, in his village, looked simple and sincere, and as if he\r\nwere not able to speak. When he was in the prince’s ancestral temple or\r\nin the court, he spoke minutely on every point, but cautiously.\r\n\r\n“When he entered the palace gate, he seemed to bend his body, as if it\r\nwere not sufficient to admit him.\r\n\r\n“He ascended the daïs, holding up his robe with both his hands and his\r\nbody bent; holding in his breath also, as if he dared not breathe.\r\n\r\n“When he was carrying the sceptre of his prince, he seemed to bend his\r\nbody as if he were not able to bear its weight.\r\n\r\n“He did not use a deep purple or a puce colour in the ornaments of his\r\ndress. Even in his undress he did not wear anything of a red or reddish\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\n“He required his sleeping dress to be half as long again as his body.\r\n\r\n“He did not eat rice which had been injured by heat or damp and turned\r\nsour, nor fish or flesh which was gone. He did not eat what was\r\ndiscoloured, or what was of a bad flavour, nor anything which was not\r\nin season. He did not eat meat which was not cut properly, nor what was\r\nserved without its proper sauce.\r\n\r\n“He was never without ginger when he ate. He did not eat much.\r\n\r\n“When eating, he did not converse. When in bed, he did not speak.\r\n\r\n“Although his food might be coarse rice and vegetable soup, he would\r\noffer a little of it in sacrifice with a grave respectful air.\r\n\r\n“If his mat was not straight, he did not sit on it.\r\n\r\n“The stable being burned down when he was at Court, on his return he\r\nsaid, ‘Has any man been hurt?’ He did not ask about the horses.\r\n\r\n“When a friend sent him a present, though it might be a carriage and\r\nhorses, he did not bow. The only present for which he bowed was that of\r\nthe flesh of sacrifice.\r\n\r\n“In bed, he did not lie like a corpse. At home, he did not put on any\r\nformal deportment.\r\n\r\n“When he saw any one in a mourning dress, though it might be an\r\nacquaintance, he would change countenance; when he saw any one wearing\r\nthe cap of full dress, or a blind person, though he might be in his\r\nundress, he would salute them in a ceremonious manner.\r\n\r\n“When he was at an entertainment where there was an abundance of\r\nprovisions set before him, he would change countenance and rise\r\nup. On a sudden clap of thunder or a violent wind, he would change\r\ncountenance.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MENCIUS]\r\n\r\nNext in educational order follows the work briefly known as\r\nMENCIUS. This consists of seven books recording the sayings\r\nand doings of a man to whose genius and devotion may be traced the\r\nfinal triumph of Confucianism. Born in B.C. 372, a little over\r\na hundred years after the death of the Master, Mencius was brought up\r\nunder the care of his widowed mother, whose name is a household word\r\neven at the present day. As a child he lived with her at first near\r\na cemetery, the result being that he began to reproduce in play the\r\nsolemn scenes which were constantly enacted before his eyes. His mother\r\naccordingly removed to another house near the market-place, and before\r\nlong the little boy forgot all about funerals and played at buying and\r\nselling goods. Once more his mother disapproved, and once more she\r\nchanged her dwelling; this time to a house near a college, where he\r\nsoon began to imitate the ceremonial observances in which the students\r\nwere instructed, to the great joy and satisfaction of his mother.\r\n\r\nLater on he studied under K‘ung Chi, the grandson of Confucius; and\r\nafter having attained to a perfect apprehension of the roms or Way\r\nof Confucius, became, at the age of about forty-five, Minister under\r\nPrince Hsüan of the Ch‘i State. But the latter would not carry out his\r\nprinciples, and Mencius threw up his post. Thence he wandered away to\r\nseveral States, advising their rulers to the best of his ability, but\r\nmaking no very prolonged stay. He then visited Prince Hui of the Liang\r\nState, and abode there until the monarch’s death in B.C. 319.\r\nAfter that event he returned to the State of Ch‘i and resumed his old\r\nposition. In B.C. 311 he once more felt himself constrained\r\nto resign office, and retired finally into private life, occupying\r\nhimself during the remainder of his days in teaching and in preparing\r\nthe philosophical record which now passes under his name. He lived at\r\na time when the feudal princes were squabbling over the rival systems\r\nof federation and imperialism, and he vainly tried to put into practice\r\nat an epoch of blood and iron the gentle virtues of the Golden Age.\r\nHis criterion was that of Confucius, but his teachings were on a lower\r\nplane, dealing rather with man’s well-being from the point of view\r\nof political economy. He was therefore justly named by Chao Ch‘i the\r\nSecond Holy One or Prophet, a title under which he is still known. He\r\nwas an uncompromising defender of the doctrines of Confucius, and he\r\nis considered to have effectually “snuffed out” the heterodox schools\r\nof Yang Chu and Mo Ti.\r\n\r\nThe following is a specimen of the logomachy of the day, in which\r\nMencius is supposed to have excelled. The subject is a favourite\r\none--human nature:--\r\n\r\n“Kao Tzŭ said, ‘Human nature may be compared with a block of wood; duty\r\ntowards one’s neighbour, with a wooden bowl. To develop charity and\r\nduty towards one’s neighbour out of human nature is like making a bowl\r\nout of a block of wood.’\r\n\r\n“To this Mencius replied, ‘Can you, without interfering with the\r\nnatural constitution of the wood, make out of it a bowl? Surely you\r\nmust do violence to that constitution in the process of making your\r\nbowl. And by parity of reasoning you would do violence to human nature\r\nin the process of developing charity and duty towards one’s neighbour.\r\nFrom which it follows that all men would come to regard these rather as\r\nevils than otherwise.’\r\n\r\n“Kao Tzŭ said, ‘Human nature is like rushing water, which flows east\r\nor west according as an outlet is made for it. For human nature\r\nmakes indifferently for good or for evil, precisely as water makes\r\nindifferently for the east or for the west.’\r\n\r\n“Mencius replied, ‘Water will indeed flow indifferently towards the\r\neast or west; but will it flow indifferently up or down? It will not;\r\nand the tendency of human nature towards good is like the tendency of\r\nwater to flow down. Every man has this bias towards good, just as all\r\nwater flows naturally downwards. By splashing water, you may indeed\r\ncause it to fly over your head; and by turning its course you may keep\r\nit for use on the hillside; but you would hardly speak of such results\r\nas the nature of water. They are the results, of course, of a _force\r\nmajeure_. And so it is when the nature of man is diverted towards evil.’\r\n\r\n“Kao Tzŭ said, ‘That which comes with life is nature.’\r\n\r\n“Mencius replied, ‘Do you mean that there is such a thing as nature in\r\nthe abstract, just as there is whiteness in the abstract?’\r\n\r\n“‘I do,’ answered Kao Tzŭ.\r\n\r\n“‘Just, for instance,’ continued Mencius, ‘as the whiteness of a\r\nfeather is the same as the whiteness of snow, or the whiteness of snow\r\nas the whiteness of jade?’\r\n\r\n“‘I do,’ answered Kao Tzŭ again.\r\n\r\n“‘In that case,’ retorted Mencius, ‘the nature of a dog is the same as\r\nthat of an ox, and the nature of an ox the same as that of a man.’\r\n\r\n“Kao Tzŭ said, ‘Eating and reproduction of the species are natural\r\ninstincts. Charity is subjective and innate; duty towards one’s\r\nneighbour is objective and acquired. For instance, there is a man who\r\nis my senior, and I defer to him as such. Not because any abstract\r\nprinciple of seniority exists subjectively in me, but in the same way\r\nthat if I see an albino, I recognise him as a white man because he\r\nis so objectively to me. Consequently, I say that duty towards one’s\r\nneighbour is objective or acquired.’\r\n\r\n“Mencius replied, ‘The cases are not analogous. The whiteness of a\r\nwhite horse is undoubtedly the same as the whiteness of a white man;\r\nbut the seniority of a horse is not the same as the seniority of a\r\nman. Does our duty to our senior begin and end with the fact of his\r\nseniority? Or does it not rather consist in the necessity of deferring\r\nto him as such?’\r\n\r\n“Kao Tzŭ said, ‘I love my own brother, but I do not love another man’s\r\nbrother. The distinction arises from within myself; therefore I call it\r\nsubjective or innate. But I defer to a stranger who is my senior, just\r\nas I defer to a senior among my own people. The distinction comes to me\r\nfrom without; therefore I call it objective or acquired.”\r\n\r\n“Mencius retorted, ‘We enjoy food cooked by strangers just as much as\r\nfood cooked by our own people. Yet extension of your principle lands\r\nus in the conclusion that our appreciation of cooked food is also\r\nobjective and acquired.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following is a well-known colloquy between Mencius and a sophist of\r\nthe day who tried to entangle the former in his talk:--\r\n\r\nThe sophist inquired, saying, “‘Is it a rule of social etiquette that\r\nwhen men and women pass things from one to another they shall not allow\r\ntheir hands to touch?’\r\n\r\n“‘That is the rule,’ replied Mencius.\r\n\r\n“‘Now suppose,’ continued the sophist, ‘that a man’s sister-in-law were\r\ndrowning, could he take hold of her hand and save her?’\r\n\r\n“‘Any one who did not do so,’ said Mencius, ‘would have the heart of a\r\nwolf. That men and women when passing things from one to another may\r\nnot let their hands touch is a rule for general application. To save\r\na drowning sister-in-law by taking hold of her hand is altogether an\r\nexceptional case.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe works of Mencius abound, like the Confucian Analects, in\r\nsententious utterances. The following examples illustrate his general\r\nbias in politics:--“The people are of the highest importance; the gods\r\ncome second; the sovereign is of lesser weight.”\r\n\r\n“Chieh and Chou lost the empire because they lost the people, which\r\nmeans that they lost the confidence of the people. The way to gain\r\nthe people is to gain their confidence, and the way to do that is to\r\nprovide them with what they like and not with what they loathe.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis is how Mencius snuffed out the two heterodox philosophers\r\nmentioned above:--\r\n\r\n“The systems of Yang Chu and Mo Ti fill the whole empire. If a man is\r\nnot a disciple of the former, he is a disciple of the latter. But Yang\r\nChu’s egoism excludes the claim of a sovereign, while Mo Ti’s universal\r\naltruism leaves out the claim of a father. And he who recognises the\r\nclaim of neither sovereign nor father is a brute beast.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYang Chu seems to have carried his egoism so far that even to benefit\r\nthe whole world he would not have parted with a single hair from his\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n“The men of old knew that with life they had come but for a while,\r\nand that with death they would shortly depart again. Therefore they\r\nfollowed the desires of their own hearts, and did not deny themselves\r\npleasures to which they felt naturally inclined. Fame tempted them not;\r\nbut led by their instincts alone, they took such enjoyments as lay in\r\ntheir path, not seeking for a name beyond the grave. They were thus out\r\nof the reach of censure; while as for precedence among men, or length\r\nor shortness of life, these gave them no concern whatever.”\r\n\r\nMo Ti, on the other hand, showed that under the altruistic system all\r\ncalamities which men bring upon one another would altogether disappear,\r\nand that the peace and happiness of the Golden Age would be renewed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TA HSÜEH AND CHUNG YUNG]\r\n\r\nIn the _Ta Hsüeh_, or Great Learning, which forms Sect. xxxix. of the\r\nBook of Rites, and really means learning for adults, we have a short\r\npolitico-ethical treatise, the authorship of which is unknown, but\r\nis usually attributed partly to Confucius, and partly to TSÊNG\r\nTS’AN, one of the most famous of his disciples. In the former\r\nportion there occurs the following well-known climax:--\r\n\r\n“The men of old, in their desire to manifest great virtue throughout\r\nthe empire, began with good government in the various States. To\r\nachieve this, it was necessary first to order aright their own\r\nfamilies, which in turn was preceded by cultivation of their own\r\nselves, and that again by rectification of the heart, following upon\r\nsincerity of purpose which comes from extension of knowledge, this last\r\nbeing derived from due investigation of objective existences.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne more short treatise, known as the _Chung Yung_, which forms Ch.\r\nxxviii. of the Book of Rites, brings us to the end of the Four Books.\r\nIts title has been translated in various ways.[2] Julien rendered the\r\nterm by “L’Invariable Milieu,” Legge by “The Doctrine of the Mean.” Its\r\nauthorship is assigned to K‘UNG CHI, grandson of Confucius.\r\nHe seems to have done little more than enlarge upon certain general\r\nprinciples of his grandfather in relation to the nature of man and\r\nright conduct upon earth. He seizes the occasion to pronounce an\r\nimpassioned eulogium upon Confucius, concluding with the following\r\nwords:--\r\n\r\n“Therefore his fame overflows the Middle Kingdom, and reaches the\r\nbarbarians of north and south. Wherever ships and waggons can go, or\r\nthe strength of man penetrate; wherever there is heaven above and earth\r\nbelow; wherever the sun and moon shed their light, or frosts and dews\r\nfall,--all who have blood and breath honour and love him. Wherefore it\r\nmay be said that he is the peer of God.”\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[2] _Chung_ means “middle,” and _Yung_ means “course,” the former being\r\ndefined by the Chinese as “that which is without deflection or bias,”\r\nthe latter as “that which never varies in its direction.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS WRITERS\r\n\r\n\r\nNames of the authors who belong to this period, B.C. 600 to\r\nB.C. 200, and of the works on a variety of subjects attributed\r\nto them, would fill a long list. Many of the latter have disappeared,\r\nand others are gross forgeries, chiefly of the first and second\r\ncenturies of our era, an epoch which, curiously enough, is remarkable\r\nfor a similar wave of forgery on the other side of the world. As to the\r\nauthors, it will be seen later on that the Chinese even went so far as\r\nto create some of these for antiquity and then write up treatises to\r\nmatch.\r\n\r\nThere was SUN TZŬ of the 6th century B.C. He is said\r\nto have written the _Ping Fa_, or Art of War, in thirteen sections,\r\nwhereby hangs a strange tale. When he was discoursing one day with\r\nPrince Ho-lu of the Wu State, the latter said, “I have read your book\r\nand want to know if you could apply its principles to women.” Sun Tzŭ\r\nreplied in the affirmative, whereupon the Prince took 180 girls out of\r\nhis harem and bade Sun Tzŭ deal with them as with troops. Accordingly\r\nhe divided them into two companies, and at the head of each placed a\r\nfavourite concubine of the Prince. But when the drums sounded for drill\r\nto begin, all the girls burst out laughing. Thereupon Sun Tzŭ, without\r\na moment’s delay, caused the two concubines in command to be beheaded.\r\nThis at once restored order, and ultimately the corps was raised to a\r\nstate of great efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe following is an extract from the Art of War:--\r\n\r\n“If soldiers are not carefully chosen and well drilled to obey, their\r\nmovements will be irregular. They will not act in concert. They will\r\nmiss success for want of unanimity. Their retreat will be disorderly,\r\none half fighting while the other is running away. They will not\r\nrespond to the call of the gong and drum. One hundred such as these\r\nwill not hold their own against ten well-drilled men.\r\n\r\n“If their arms are not good, the soldiers might as well have none. If\r\nthe cuirass is not stout and close set, the breast might as well be\r\nbare. Bows that will not carry are no more use at long distances than\r\nswords and spears. Bad marksmen might as well have no arrows. Even good\r\nmarksmen, unless able to make their arrows pierce, might as well shoot\r\nwith headless shafts. These are the oversights of incompetent generals.\r\nFive such soldiers are no match for one.”\r\n\r\nIt is notwithstanding very doubtful if we have any genuine remains of\r\neither Sun Tzŭ, or of Kuan Tzŭ, Wu Tzŭ, Wên Tzŭ, and several other\r\nearly writers on war, political philosophy, and cognate subjects. The\r\nsame remark applies equally to Chinese medical literature, the bulk of\r\nwhich is enormous, some of it nominally dating back to legendary times,\r\nbut always failing to stand the application of the simplest test.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Erh Ya_, or Nearing the Standard, is a work which has often been\r\nassigned to the 12th century B.C. It is a guide to the correct\r\nuse of many miscellaneous terms, including names of animals, birds,\r\nplants, etc., to which are added numerous illustrations. It was first\r\nedited with commentary by Kuo P‘o, of whom we shall read later on, and\r\nsome Chinese critics would have us believe that the illustrations we\r\nnow possess were then already in existence. But the whole question is\r\ninvolved in mystery. The following will give an idea of the text:--\r\n\r\n“For metal we say _lou_ (to chase); for wood _k‘o_ (to carve); for bone\r\n_ch‘ieh_ (to cut),” etc., etc.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: T‘AN KUNG]\r\n\r\nThere are some interesting remains of a writer named T‘AN KUNG, who\r\nflourished in the 4th and 3rd centuries B.C., and whose work has been\r\nincluded in the Book of Rites. The three following extracts will give\r\nan idea of his scope:--\r\n\r\n1. “One day Yu-tzŭ and Tzŭ-yu saw a child weeping for the loss of its\r\nparents. Thereupon the former observed, ‘I never could understand\r\nwhy mourners should necessarily jump about to show their grief, and\r\nwould long ago have got rid of the custom. Now here you have an honest\r\nexpression of feeling, and that is all there should ever be.’\r\n\r\n“‘My friend,’ replied Tzŭ-yu, ‘the mourning ceremonial, with all its\r\nmaterial accompaniments, is at once a check upon undue emotion and a\r\nguarantee against any lack of proper respect. Simply to give vent to\r\nthe feelings is the way of barbarians. That is not our way.\r\n\r\n“‘Consider. A man who is pleased will show it in his face. He will\r\nsing. He will get excited. He will dance. So, too, a man who is vexed\r\nwill look sad. He will sigh. He will beat his breast. He will jump\r\nabout. The due regulation of these emotions is the function of a set\r\nceremonial.\r\n\r\n“‘Further. A man dies and becomes an object of loathing. A dead body is\r\nshunned. Therefore, a shroud is prepared, and other paraphernalia of\r\nburial, in order that the survivors may cease to loathe. At death there\r\nis a sacrifice of wine and meat; when the funeral cortège is about to\r\nstart, there is another; and after burial there is yet another. Yet no\r\none ever saw the spirit of the departed come to taste of the food.\r\n\r\n“‘These have been our customs from remote antiquity. They have not been\r\ndiscarded, because, in consequence, men no more shun the dead. What you\r\nmay censure in those who perform the ceremonial is no blemish in the\r\nceremonial itself.’”\r\n\r\n2. “When Tzŭ-chü died, his wife and secretary took counsel together as\r\nto who should be interred with him. All was settled before the arrival\r\nof his brother, Tzŭ-hêng; and then they informed him, saying, ‘The\r\ndeceased requires some one to attend upon him in the nether world. We\r\nmust ask you to go down with his body into the grave.’ ‘Burial of the\r\nliving with the dead,’ replied Tzŭ-hêng, ‘is not in accordance with\r\nestablished rites. Still, as you say some one is wanted to attend upon\r\nthe deceased, who better fitted than his wife and secretary? If this\r\ncontingency can be avoided altogether, I am willing; if not, then the\r\nduty will devolve upon you two.’ From that time forth the custom fell\r\ninto desuetude.”\r\n\r\n3. “When Confucius was crossing the T‘ai mountain, he overheard a\r\nwoman weeping and wailing beside a grave. He thereupon sent one of\r\nhis disciples to ask what was the matter; and the latter addressed\r\nthe woman, saying, ‘Some great sorrow must have come upon you that\r\nyou give way to grief like this?’ ‘Indeed it is so,’ replied she. ‘My\r\nfather-in-law was killed here by a tiger; after that, my husband;\r\nand now my son has perished by the same death.’ ‘But why, then,’\r\ninquired Confucius, ‘do you not go away?’ ‘The government is not\r\nharsh,’ answered the woman. ‘There!’ cried the Master, turning to his\r\ndisciples; ‘remember that. Bad government is worse than a tiger.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HSÜN TZŬ]\r\n\r\nThe philosopher HSÜN TZŬ of the 3rd century B.C.\r\nis widely known for his heterodox views on the nature of man, being\r\ndirectly opposed to the Confucian doctrine so warmly advocated by\r\nMencius. The following passage, which hardly carries conviction,\r\ncontains the gist of his argument:--\r\n\r\n“By nature, man is evil. If a man is good, that is an artificial\r\nresult. For his condition being what it is, he is influenced first of\r\nall by a desire for gain. Hence he strives to get all he can without\r\nconsideration for his neighbour. Secondly, he is liable to envy and\r\nhate. Hence he seeks the ruin of others, and loyalty and truth are set\r\naside. Thirdly, he is a slave to his animal passions. Hence he commits\r\nexcesses, and wanders from the path of duty and right.\r\n\r\n“Thus, conformity with man’s natural disposition leads to all kinds of\r\nviolence, disorder, and ultimate barbarism. Only under the restraint of\r\nlaw and of lofty moral influences does man eventually become fit to be\r\na member of regularly organised society.\r\n\r\n“From these premisses it seems quite clear that by nature man is evil;\r\nand that if a man is good, that is an artificial result.”\r\n\r\nThe _Hsiao Ching_, or Classic of Filial Piety, is assigned partly to\r\nConfucius and partly to TSÊNG TS’AN, though it more probably\r\nbelongs to a very much later date. Considering that filial piety is\r\nadmittedly the keystone of Chinese civilisation, it is disappointing to\r\nfind nothing more on the subject than a poor pamphlet of commonplace\r\nand ill-strung sentences, which gives the impression of having been\r\nwritten to fill a void. One short extract will suffice:--\r\n\r\n“The Master said, ‘There are three thousand offences against which the\r\nfive punishments are directed, and there is not one of them greater\r\nthan being unfilial.\r\n\r\n“‘When constraint is put upon a ruler, that is the disowning of his\r\nsuperiority; when the authority of the sages is disallowed, that is\r\nthe disowning of all law; when filial piety is put aside, that is the\r\ndisowning of the principle of affection. These three things pave the\r\nway to anarchy.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Chia Yü_, or Family Sayings of Confucius, is a work with a\r\nfascinating title, which has been ascribed by some to the immediate\r\ndisciples of Confucius, but which, as it now exists, is usually thought\r\nby native scholars to have been composed by Wang Su, a learned official\r\nwho died A.D. 256. There appears to have been an older work\r\nunder this same title, but how far the later work is indebted to it, or\r\nbased upon it, seems likely to remain unknown.\r\n\r\nAnother discredited work is the _Lü Shih Ch‘un Ch‘iu_, or Spring and\r\nAutumn of LÜ PU-WEI, who died B.C. 235 and was the putative sire of the\r\nFirst Emperor (see ch. vii.). It contains a great deal about the early\r\nhistory of China, some of which is no doubt based upon fact.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MU T‘IEN TZŬ CHUAN]\r\n\r\nLastly, among spurious books may be mentioned the MU T‘IEN TZŬ\r\nCHUAN, an account of a mythical journey by a sovereign of the\r\nChou dynasty, supposed to have been taken about 1000 B.C. The\r\nsovereign is unfortunately spoken of by his posthumous title, and the\r\nwork was evidently written up in the 3rd century A.D. to suit\r\na statement found in Lieh Tzŭ (see chapter vi.) to the effect that the\r\nruler in question did make some such journey to the West.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V\r\n\r\nPOETRY--INSCRIPTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe poetry which is representative of the period between the death of\r\nConfucius and the 2nd century B.C. is a thing apart. There is nothing\r\nlike it in the whole range of Chinese literature. It illumines many\r\na native pronouncement on the poetic art, the drift of which would\r\notherwise remain obscure. For poetry has been defined by the Chinese as\r\n“emotion expressed in words,” a definition perhaps not more inadequate\r\nthan Wordsworth’s “impassioned expression.” “Poetry,” they say, “knows\r\nno law.” And again, “The men of old reckoned it the highest excellence\r\nin poetry that the meaning should lie beyond the words, and that the\r\nreader should have to think it out.” Of these three canons only the\r\nlast can be said to have survived to the present day. But in the fourth\r\ncentury B.C., Ch‘ü Yüan and his school indulged in wild irregular\r\nmetres which consorted well with their wild irregular thoughts. Their\r\npoetry was prose run mad. It was allusive and allegorical to a high\r\ndegree, and now, but for the commentary, much of it would be quite\r\nunintelligible.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LI SAO]\r\n\r\nCH’Ü YÜAN is the type of a loyal Minister. He enjoyed the\r\nfull confidence of his Prince until at length the jealousies and\r\nintrigues of rivals sapped his position in the State. Then it was\r\nthat he composed the _Li Sao_, or Falling into Trouble, the first\r\nsection of which extends to nearly 400 lines. Beginning from the\r\nbirth of the writer, it describes his cultivation of virtue and his\r\nearnest endeavour to translate precept into practice. Discouraged by\r\nfailure, he visits the grave of the Emperor Shun (chapter ii.), and\r\ngives himself up to prayer, until at length a phœnix-car and dragons\r\nappear, and carry him in search of his ideal away beyond the domain of\r\nmortality,--the chariot of the Sun moving slowly to light him longer\r\non the way, the Moon leading and the Winds bringing up the rear,--up\r\nto the very palace of God. Unable to gain admission here, he seeks out\r\na famous magician, who counsels him to stand firm and to continue his\r\nsearch; whereupon, surrounded by gorgeous clouds and dazzling rainbows,\r\nand amid the music of tinkling ornaments attached to his car, he starts\r\nfrom the Milky Way, and passing the Western Pole, reaches the sources\r\nof the Yellow River. Before long he is once again in sight of his\r\nnative land, but without having discovered the object of his search.\r\n\r\nOverwhelmed by further disappointments, and sinking still more deeply\r\ninto disfavour, so that he cared no longer to live, he went forth to\r\nthe banks of the Mi-lo river. There he met a fisherman who accosted\r\nhim, saying, “Are you not his Excellency the Minister? What has brought\r\nyou to this pass?” “The world,” replied Ch‘ü Yüan, “is foul, and I\r\nalone am clean. There they are all drunk, while I alone am sober. So\r\nI am dismissed.” “Ah!” said the fisherman, “the true sage does not\r\nquarrel with his environment, but adapts himself to it. If, as you\r\nsay, the world is foul, why not leap into the tide and make it clean?\r\nIf all men are drunk, why not drink with them and teach them to avoid\r\nexcess?” After some further colloquy, the fisherman rowed away; and\r\nCh‘ü Yüan, clasping a large stone in his arms, plunged into the river\r\nand was seen no more. This took place on the fifth of the fifth moon;\r\nand ever afterwards the people of Ch‘u commemorated the day by an\r\nannual festival, when offerings of rice in bamboo tubes were cast into\r\nthe river as a sacrifice to the spirit of their great hero. Such is the\r\norigin of the modern Dragon-Boat Festival, which is supposed to be a\r\nsearch for the body of Ch‘ü Yüan.\r\n\r\nA good specimen of his style will be found in the following short poem,\r\nentitled “The Genius of the Mountain.” It is one of “nine songs” which,\r\ntogether with a number of other pieces in a similar strain, have been\r\nclassed under the general heading, _Li Sao_, as above.\r\n\r\n“Methinks there is a Genius of the hills, clad in wistaria, girdled\r\nwith ivy, with smiling lips, of witching mien, riding on the red pard,\r\nwild cats galloping in the rear, reclining in a chariot, with banners\r\nof cassia, cloaked with the orchid, girt with azalea, culling the\r\nperfume of sweet flowers to leave behind a memory in the heart. But\r\ndark is the grove wherein I dwell. No light of day reaches it ever. The\r\npath thither is dangerous and difficult to climb. Alone I stand on the\r\nhill-top, while the clouds float beneath my feet, and all around is\r\nwrapped in gloom.\r\n\r\n“Gently blows the east wind; softly falls the rain. In my joy I become\r\noblivious of home; for who in my decline would honour me now?\r\n\r\n“I pluck the larkspur on the hillside, amid the chaos of rock and\r\ntangled vine. I hate him who has made me an outcast, who has now no\r\nleisure to think of me.\r\n\r\n“I drink from the rocky spring. I shade myself beneath the spreading\r\npine. Even though he were to recall me to him, I could not fall to the\r\nlevel of the world.\r\n\r\n“Now booms the thunder through the drizzling rain. The gibbons howl\r\naround me all the long night. The gale rushes fitfully through the\r\nwhispering trees. And I am thinking of my Prince, but in vain; for I\r\ncannot lay my grief.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SUNG YÜ]\r\n\r\nAnother leading poet of the day was SUNG YÜ, of whom we know\r\nlittle beyond the fact that he was nephew of Ch‘ü Yüan, and like his\r\nuncle both a statesman and a poet. The following extract exhibits him\r\nin a mood not far removed from the lamentations of the _Li Sao_:--\r\n\r\n  “_Among birds the phœnix, among fishes the leviathan holds the\r\n      chiefest place;\r\n  Cleaving the crimson clouds the phœnix soars apace,\r\n  With only the blue sky above, far into the realms of space;\r\n  But the grandeur of heaven and earth is as naught to the\r\n      hedge-sparrow race._\r\n\r\n  _And the leviathan rises in one ocean to go to rest in a second,\r\n  While the depth of a puddle by a humble minnow as the depth of the\r\n      sea is reckoned._\r\n\r\n  _And just as with birds and with fishes, so too it is with man;\r\n  Here soars a phœnix, there swims a leviathan ...\r\n  Behold the philosopher, full of nervous thought, with a flame that\r\n      never grows dim,\r\n  Dwelling complacently alone; say, what can the vulgar herd know\r\n      of him?_”\r\n\r\nAs has been stated above, the poems of this school are irregular\r\nin metre; in fact, they are only approximately metrical. The poet\r\nnever ends his line in deference to a prescribed number of feet, but\r\nlengthens or shortens to suit the exigency of his thought. Similarly,\r\nhe may rhyme or he may not. The reader, however, is never conscious of\r\nany want of art, carried away as he is by flow of language and rapid\r\nsuccession of poetical imagery.\r\n\r\nSeveral other poets, such as Chia I and Tung-fang So, who cultivated\r\nthis particular vein, but on a somewhat lower plane, belong to the\r\nsecond century B.C., thus overlapping a period which must be\r\nregarded as heralding the birth of a new style rather than occupied\r\nwith the passing of the old.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt may here be mentioned that many short pieces of doubtful age and\r\nauthorship--some few unquestionably old--have been rescued by Chinese\r\nscholars from various sources, and formed into convenient collections.\r\nOf such is a verse known as “Yao’s Advice,” Yao being the legendary\r\nmonarch mentioned in chapter ii., who is associated with Shun in\r\nChina’s Golden Age:--\r\n\r\n  “_With trembling heart and cautious steps\r\n    Walk daily in fear of God ...\r\n  Though you never trip over a mountain,\r\n    You may often trip over a clod._”\r\n\r\nThere is also the husbandman’s song, which enlarges upon the national\r\nhappiness of those halcyon days:--\r\n\r\n  “_Work, work;--from the rising sun\r\n  Till sunset comes and the day is done\r\n      I plough the sod\r\n      And harrow the clod,\r\n  And meat and drink both come to me,\r\n  So what care I for the powers that be?_”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: INSCRIPTIONS]\r\n\r\nIt seems to have been customary in early days to attach inscriptions,\r\npoetical and otherwise, to all sorts of articles for daily use. On\r\nthe bath-tub of T‘ang, founder of the Shang dynasty in B.C.\r\n1766, there was said to have been written these words:--“If any one on\r\nany one day can make a new man of himself, let him do so every day.”\r\nSimilarly, an old metal mirror bore as its legend, “Man combs his hair\r\nevery morning: why not his heart?” And the following lines are said to\r\nbe taken from an ancient wash-basin:--\r\n\r\n  “_Oh, rather than sink in the world’s foul tide\r\n  I would sink in the bottomless main;\r\n  For he who sinks in the world’s foul tide\r\n  In noisome depths shall for ever abide,\r\n  But he who sinks in the bottomless main\r\n  May hope to float to the surface again._”\r\n\r\nIn this class of verse, too, the metre is often irregular and the rhyme\r\na mere jingle, according to the canons of the stricter prosody which\r\ncame into existence later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTAOISM--THE “TAO-TÊ-CHING”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TAO-TÊ-CHING]\r\n\r\nThe reader is now asked to begin once more at the sixth century\r\nB.C. So far we have dealt almost exclusively with what may\r\nbe called orthodox literature, that is to say, of or belonging to or\r\nbased upon the Confucian Canon. It seemed advisable to get that well\r\noff our hands before entering upon another branch, scarcely indeed as\r\nimportant, but much more difficult to handle. This branch consists of\r\nthe literature of Taoism, or that which has gathered around what is\r\nknown as the Tao or Way of LAO TZŬ, growing and flourishing\r\nalongside of, though in direct antagonism to, that which is founded\r\nupon the criteria and doctrines of Confucius. Unfortunately it is quite\r\nimpossible to explain at the outset in what this Tao actually consists.\r\nAccording to Lao Tzŭ himself, “Those who know do not tell; those who\r\ntell do not know.” It is hoped, however, that by the time the end of\r\nthis chapter is reached, some glimmering of the meaning of Tao may have\r\nreached the minds of those who have been patient enough to follow the\r\nargument.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LAO TZŬ]\r\n\r\nLao Tzŭ was born, according to the weight of evidence, in the year\r\nB.C. 604. Omitting all reference to the supernatural phenomena\r\nwhich attended his birth and early years, it only remains to say that\r\nwe really know next to nothing about him. There is a short biography\r\nof Lao Tzŭ to be found in the history of Ssŭ-ma Ch‘ien, to be dealt\r\nwith in Book II., chapter iii., but internal evidence points to\r\nembroidery laid on by other hands. Just as it was deemed necessary by\r\npious enthusiasts to interpolate in the work of Josephus a passage\r\nreferring to Christ, so it would appear that the original note by\r\nSsŭ-ma Ch‘ien has been carefully touched up to suit the requirements\r\nof an unauthenticated meeting between Lao Tzŭ and Confucius, which has\r\nbeen inserted very much _à propos de bottes_; the more so, as Confucius\r\nis made to visit Lao Tzŭ with a view to information on Rites, a subject\r\nwhich Lao Tzŭ held in very low esteem. This biography ends with the\r\nfollowing extraordinary episode:--\r\n\r\n“Lao Tzŭ abode for a long time in Chou, but when he saw that the State\r\nshowed signs of decay, he left. On reaching the frontier, the Warden,\r\nnamed Yin Hsi, said to him, ‘So you are going into retirement. I beg\r\nyou to write a book for me.’ Thereupon Lao Tzŭ wrote a book, in two\r\nparts, on Tao and Tê,[3] extending to over 5000 words. He then went\r\naway, and no one knows where he died.”\r\n\r\nIt is clear from Ssŭ-ma Ch‘ien’s account that he himself had never seen\r\nthe book, though a dwindling minority still believe that we possess\r\nthat book in the well-known _Tao-Tê-Ching_.\r\n\r\nIt must now be stated that throughout what are generally believed\r\nto be the writings of Confucius the name of Lao Tzŭ is never once\r\nmentioned.[4] It is not mentioned by Tso of the famous commentary, nor\r\nby the editors of the Confucian Analects, nor by Tsêng Ts‘an, nor by\r\nMencius. Chuang Tzŭ, who devoted all his energies to the exposition and\r\nenforcement of the teaching of Lao Tzŭ, never once drops even a hint\r\nthat his Master had written a book. In his work will now be found an\r\naccount of the meeting of Confucius and Lao Tzŭ, but it has long since\r\nbeen laughed out of court as a pious fraud by every competent Chinese\r\ncritic. Chu Hsi, Shên Jo-shui, and many others, declare emphatically\r\nagainst the genuineness of the _Tao-Tê-Ching_; and scant allusion would\r\nindeed have been made to it here, were it not for the attention paid to\r\nit by several more or less eminent foreign students of the language.\r\nIt is interesting as a collection of many genuine utterances of Lao\r\nTzŭ, sandwiched however between thick wads of padding from which little\r\nmeaning can be extracted except by enthusiasts who curiously enough\r\ndisagree absolutely among themselves. A few examples from the real Lao\r\nTzŭ will now be given:--\r\n\r\n“The Way (Tao) which can be walked upon is not the eternal Way.”\r\n\r\n“Follow diligently the Way in your own heart, but make no display of it\r\nto the world.”\r\n\r\n“By many words wit is exhausted; it is better to preserve a mean.”\r\n\r\n“To the good I would be good. To the not-good I would also be good, in\r\norder to make them good.”\r\n\r\n“Recompense injury with kindness.”\r\n\r\n“Put yourself behind, and you shall be put in front.”\r\n\r\n“Abandon wisdom and discard knowledge, and the people will be benefited\r\nan hundredfold.”\r\n\r\nThese last maxims are supposed to illustrate Lao Tzŭ’s favourite\r\ndoctrine of doing nothing, or, as it has been termed, Inaction, a\r\ndoctrine inseparably associated with his name, and one which has ever\r\nexerted much fascination over the more imaginative of his countrymen.\r\nIt was openly enunciated as follows:--\r\n\r\n“Do nothing, and all things will be done.”\r\n\r\n“I do nothing, and the people become good of their own accord.”\r\n\r\nTo turn to the padding, as rendered by the late Drs. Chalmers and\r\nLegge, we may take a paragraph which now passes as chapter vi.:--\r\n\r\nCHALMERS:--“The Spirit (like perennial spring) of the valley\r\nnever dies. This (Spirit) I call the abyss-mother. The passage of the\r\nabyss-mother I call the root of heaven and earth. Ceaselessly it seems\r\nto endure, and it is employed without effort.”\r\n\r\n  LEGGE:--“_The valley spirit dies not, aye the same;\r\n  The female mystery thus do we name.\r\n  Its gate, from which at first they issued forth,\r\n  Is called the root from which grew heaven and earth.\r\n  Long and unbroken does its power remain,\r\n  Used gently, and without the touch of pain._”\r\n\r\nOne more example from Chalmers’ translation will perhaps seal the fate\r\nof this book with readers who claim at least a minimum of sense from an\r\nold-world classic.\r\n\r\n  “_Where water abides, it is good for adaptability.\r\n  In its heart, it is good for depth.\r\n  In giving, it is good for benevolence.\r\n  In speaking, it is good for fidelity._”\r\n\r\nThat there was such a philosopher as Lao Tzŭ who lived about the time\r\nindicated, and whose sayings have come down to us first by tradition\r\nand later by written and printed record, cannot possibly be doubted.\r\nThe great work of Chuang Tzŭ would be sufficient to establish this\r\nbeyond cavil, while at the same time it forms a handy guide to a nearer\r\nappreciation of this elusive Tao.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHUANG TZŬ]\r\n\r\nCHUANG TZŬ was born in the fourth century B.C., and\r\nheld a petty official post. “He wrote,” says the historian Ssŭ-ma\r\nCh‘ien, “with a view to asperse the Confucian school and to glorify the\r\nmysteries of Lao Tzŭ.... His teachings are like an overwhelming flood,\r\nwhich spreads at its own sweet will. Consequently, from rulers and\r\nministers downwards, none could apply them to any definite use.”\r\n\r\nHere we have the key to the triumph of the Tao of Confucius over the\r\nTao of Lao Tzŭ. The latter was idealistic, the former a practical\r\nsystem for everyday use. And Chuang Tzŭ was unable to persuade the\r\ncalculating Chinese nation that by doing nothing, all things would\r\nbe done. But he bequeathed to posterity a work which, by reason of\r\nits marvellous literary beauty, has always held a foremost place.\r\nIt is also a work of much originality of thought. The writer, it is\r\ntrue, appears chiefly as a disciple insisting upon the principles of\r\na Master. But he has contrived to extend the field, and carry his own\r\nspeculations into regions never dreamt of by Lao Tzŭ.\r\n\r\nThe whole work of Chuang Tzŭ has not come down to us, neither can all\r\nthat now passes under his name be regarded as genuine. Alien hands have\r\nadded, vainly indeed, many passages and several entire chapters. But\r\na sable robe, says the Chinese proverb, cannot be eked out with dogs’\r\ntails. Lin Hsi-chung, a brilliant critic of the seventeenth century, to\r\nwhose edition all students should turn, has shown with unerring touch\r\nwhere the lion left off and the jackals began.\r\n\r\nThe honour of the first edition really belongs to a volatile spirit of\r\nthe third century A.D., named Hsiang Hsiu. He was probably the\r\nfounder, at any rate a member, of a small club of bibulous poets who\r\ncalled themselves the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove. Death, however,\r\ninterrupted his labours before he had finished his work on Chuang Tzŭ,\r\nand the manuscript was purloined by Kuo Hsiang, a scholar who died\r\nA.D. 312, and with some additions was issued by the latter as\r\nhis own.\r\n\r\nBefore attempting to illustrate by extracts the style and scope of\r\nChuang Tzŭ, it will be well to collect from his work a few passages\r\ndealing with the attributes of Tao. In his most famous chapter,\r\nentitled Autumn Floods, a name by which he himself is sometimes spoken\r\nof, Chuang Tzŭ writes as follows:--\r\n\r\n“Tao is without beginning, without end.” Elsewhere he says, “There is\r\nnowhere where it is not.” “Tao cannot be heard; heard, it is not Tao.\r\nTao cannot be seen; seen, it is not Tao. Tao cannot be spoken; spoken,\r\nit is not Tao. That which imparts form to forms is itself formless;\r\ntherefore Tao cannot have a name (as form precedes name).”\r\n\r\n“Tao is not too small for the greatest, nor too great for the smallest.\r\nThus all things are embosomed therein; wide, indeed, its boundless\r\ncapacity, unfathomable its depth.”\r\n\r\n“By no thoughts, by no cogitations, Tao may be known. By resting in\r\nnothing, by according in nothing, Tao may be approached. By following\r\nnothing, by pursuing nothing, Tao may be attained.”\r\n\r\nIn these and many like passages Lao Tzŭ would have been in full\r\nsympathy with his disciple. So far as it is possible to deduce anything\r\ndefinite from the scanty traditions of the teachings of Lao Tzŭ,\r\nwe seem to obtain this, that man should remain impassive under the\r\noperation of an eternal, omnipresent law (Tao), and that thus he will\r\nbecome in perfect harmony with his environment, and that if he is\r\nin harmony with his environment, he will thereby attain to a vague\r\ncondition of general immunity. Beyond this the teachings of Lao Tzŭ\r\nwould not carry us. Chuang Tzŭ, however, from simple problems, such as\r\na drunken man falling out of a cart and not injuring himself--a common\r\nsuperstition among sailors--because he is unconscious and therefore\r\nin harmony with his environment, slides easily into an advanced\r\nmysticism. In his marvellous chapter on The Identity of Contraries, he\r\nmaintains that from the standpoint of Tao all things are One. Positive\r\nand negative, this and that, here and there, somewhere and nowhere,\r\nright and wrong, vertical and horizontal, subjective and objective,\r\nbecome indistinct, as water is in water. “When subjective and objective\r\nare both without their correlates, that is the very axis of Tao. And\r\nwhen that axis passes through the centre at which all Infinities\r\nconverge, positive and negative alike blend into an infinite One.”\r\nThis localisation in a Centre, and this infinite absolute represented\r\nby One, were too concrete even for Chuang Tzŭ. The One became God, and\r\nthe Centre, assigned by later Taoist writers to the pole-star (see\r\nBook IV. ch. i.), became the source of all life and the haven to which\r\nsuch life returned after its transitory stay on earth. By ignoring the\r\ndistinctions of contraries “we are embraced in the obliterating unity\r\nof God. Take no heed of time, nor of right and wrong; but passing into\r\nthe realm of the Infinite, make your final rest therein.”\r\n\r\nThat the idea of an indefinite future state was familiar to the mind of\r\nChuang Tzŭ may be gathered from many passages such as the following:--\r\n\r\n“How then do I know but that the dead repent of having previously clung\r\nto life?\r\n\r\n“Those who dream of the banquet, wake to lamentation and sorrow. Those\r\nwho dream of lamentation and sorrow, wake to join the hunt. While they\r\ndream, they do not know that they dream. Some will even interpret the\r\nvery dream they are dreaming; and only when they awake do they know\r\nit was a dream. By and by comes the Great Awakening, and then we find\r\nout that this life is really a great dream. Fools think they are awake\r\nnow, and flatter themselves they know if they are really princes or\r\npeasants. Confucius and you are both dreams; and I who say you are\r\ndreams,--I am but a dream myself.”\r\n\r\nThe chapter closes with a paragraph which has gained for its writer an\r\nadditional epithet, Butterfly Chuang:--\r\n\r\n“Once upon a time, I, Chuang Tzŭ, dreamt I was a butterfly, fluttering\r\nhither and thither, to all intents and purposes a butterfly. I was\r\nconscious only of following my fancies as a butterfly, and was\r\nunconscious of my individuality as a man. Suddenly, I awaked, and\r\nthere I lay, myself again. Now I do not know whether I was then a man\r\ndreaming I was a butterfly, or whether I am now a butterfly dreaming I\r\nam a man.”\r\n\r\nChuang Tzŭ is fond of paradox. He delights in dwelling on the\r\nusefulness of useless things. He shows that ill-grown or inferior trees\r\nare allowed to stand, that diseased pigs are not killed for sacrifice,\r\nand that a hunchback can not only make a good living by washing, for\r\nwhich a bent body is no drawback, but escapes the dreaded press-gang in\r\ntime of war.\r\n\r\nWith a few illustrative extracts we must now take leave of Chuang Tzŭ,\r\na writer who, although heterodox in the eyes of a Confucianist, has\r\nalways been justly esteemed for his pointed wit and charming style.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(1.) “It was the time of autumn floods. Every stream poured into the\r\nriver, which swelled in its turbid course. The banks receded so far\r\nfrom one another that it was impossible to tell a cow from a horse.\r\n\r\n“Then the Spirit of the River laughed for joy that all the beauty of\r\nthe earth was gathered to himself. Down with the stream he journeyed\r\neast, until he reached the ocean. There, looking eastwards and seeing\r\nno limit to its waves, his countenance changed. And as he gazed over\r\nthe expanse, he sighed and said to the Spirit of the Ocean, ‘A vulgar\r\nproverb says, that he who has heard but part of the truth thinks no one\r\nequal to himself. And such a one am I.\r\n\r\n“‘When formerly I heard people detracting from the learning of\r\nConfucius, or underrating the heroism of Po I, I did not believe. But\r\nnow that I have looked upon your inexhaustibility--alas for me had I\r\nnot reached your abode, I should have been for ever a laughing-stock to\r\nthose of comprehensive enlightenment!’\r\n\r\n“To which the Spirit of the Ocean replied, ‘You cannot speak of ocean\r\nto a well-frog, the creature of a narrower sphere. You cannot speak of\r\nice to a summer-insect,--the creature of a season. You cannot speak\r\nof Tao to a pedagogue: his scope is too restricted. But now that you\r\nhave emerged from your narrow sphere and have seen the great ocean,\r\nyou know your own insignificance, and I can speak to you of great\r\nprinciples.’”\r\n\r\n(2.) “Have you never heard of the frog in the old well?--The frog said\r\nto the turtle of the eastern sea, ‘Happy indeed am I! I hop on to\r\nthe rail around the well. I rest in the hollow of some broken brick.\r\nSwimming, I gather the water under my arms and shut my mouth. I plunge\r\ninto the mud, burying my feet and toes; and not one of the cockles,\r\ncrabs, or tadpoles I see around me are my match. [Fancy pitting the\r\nhappiness of an old well, ejaculates Chuang Tzŭ, against all the water\r\nof Ocean!] Why do you not come, sir, and pay me a visit?’[5]\r\n\r\n“Now the turtle of the eastern sea had not got its left leg down ere\r\nits right had already stuck fast, so it shrank back and begged to be\r\nexcused. It then described the sea, saying, ‘A thousand _li_ would\r\nnot measure its breadth, nor a thousand fathoms its depth. In the\r\ndays of the Great Yü, there were nine years of flood out of ten; but\r\nthis did not add to its bulk. In the days of T‘ang, there were seven\r\nyears out of eight of drought; but this did not narrow its span. Not\r\nto be affected by duration of time, not to be affected by volume of\r\nwater,--such is the great happiness of the eastern sea.’\r\n\r\n“At this the well-frog was considerably astonished, and knew not\r\nwhat to say next. And for one whose knowledge does not reach to the\r\npositive-negative domain, to attempt to understand me, Chuang Tzŭ,\r\nis like a mosquito trying to carry a mountain, or an ant to swim a\r\nriver,--they cannot succeed.”\r\n\r\n(3.) “Chuang Tzŭ was fishing in the P‘u when the prince of Ch‘u sent\r\ntwo high officials to ask him to take charge of the administration of\r\nthe Ch‘u State.\r\n\r\n“Chuang Tzŭ went on fishing, and without turning his head said, ‘I\r\nhave heard that in Ch‘u there is a sacred tortoise which has been dead\r\nnow some three thousand years. And that the prince keeps this tortoise\r\ncarefully enclosed in a chest on the altar of his ancestral temple. Now\r\nwould this tortoise rather be dead, and have its remains venerated, or\r\nbe alive and wagging its tail in the mud?’\r\n\r\n“‘It would rather be alive,’ replied the two officials, ‘and wagging\r\nits tail in the mud.’\r\n\r\n“‘Begone!’ cried Chuang Tzŭ. ‘I too will wag my tail in the mud.’”\r\n\r\n(4.) “Chuang Tzŭ one day saw an empty skull, bleached, but still\r\npreserving its shape. Striking it with his riding whip, he said, ‘Wert\r\nthou once some ambitious citizen whose inordinate yearnings brought\r\nhim to this pass?--some statesman who plunged his country in ruin, and\r\nperished in the fray?--some wretch who left behind him a legacy of\r\nshame?--some beggar who died in the pangs of hunger and cold? Or didst\r\nthou reach this state by the natural course of old age?’\r\n\r\n“When he had finished speaking, he took the skull, and placing it under\r\nhis head as a pillow, went to sleep. In the night, he dreamt that the\r\nskull appeared to him, and said, ‘You speak well, sir; but all you say\r\nhas reference to the life of mortals, and to mortal troubles. In death\r\nthere are none of these. Would you like to hear about death?’\r\n\r\n“Chuang Tzŭ having replied in the affirmative, the skull began:--‘In\r\ndeath, there is no sovereign above, and no subject below. The workings\r\nof the four seasons are unknown. Our existences are bounded only by\r\neternity. The happiness of a king among men cannot exceed that which we\r\nenjoy.’\r\n\r\n“Chuang Tzŭ, however, was not convinced, and said, ‘Were I to prevail\r\nupon God to allow your body to be born again, and your bones and flesh\r\nto be renewed, so that you could return to your parents, to your wife,\r\nand to the friends of your youth--would you be willing?’\r\n\r\n“At this, the skull opened its eyes wide and knitted its brows and\r\nsaid, ‘How should I cast aside happiness greater than that of a king,\r\nand mingle once again in the toils and troubles of mortality?’”\r\n\r\n(5.) “The Grand Augur, in his ceremonial robes, approached the shambles\r\nand thus addressed the pigs:--\r\n\r\n“‘How can you object to die? I shall fatten you for three months. I\r\nshall discipline myself for ten days and fast for three. I shall strew\r\nfine grass, and place you bodily upon a carved sacrificial dish. Does\r\nnot this satisfy you?’\r\n\r\n“Then speaking from the pigs’ point of view, he continued, ‘It is\r\nbetter perhaps after all to live on bran and escape the shambles....’\r\n\r\n“‘But then,’ added he, speaking from his own point of view, ‘to enjoy\r\nhonour when alive one would readily die on a war-shield or in the\r\nheadsman’s basket.’\r\n\r\n“So he rejected the pigs’ point of view and adopted his own point of\r\nview. In what sense then was he different from the pigs?”\r\n\r\n(6.) “When Chuang Tzŭ was about to die, his disciples expressed a wish\r\nto give him a splendid funeral. But Chuang Tzŭ said, ‘With heaven and\r\nearth for my coffin and shell, with the sun, moon, and stars as my\r\nburial regalia, and with all creation to escort me to the grave,--are\r\nnot my funeral paraphernalia ready to hand?’\r\n\r\n“‘We fear,’ argued the disciples, ‘lest the carrion kite should eat the\r\nbody of our Master’; to which Chuang Tzŭ replied, ‘Above ground I shall\r\nbe food for kites, below I shall be food for mole-crickets and ants.\r\nWhy rob one to feed the other?’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LIEH TZŬ]\r\n\r\nThe works of LIEH TZŬ, in two thin volumes, may be procured at\r\nany Chinese book-shop. These volumes profess to contain the writings\r\nof a Taoist philosopher who flourished some years before Chuang Tzŭ,\r\nand for a long time they received considerable attention at the hands\r\nof European students, into whose minds no suspicion of their real\r\ncharacter seems to have found its way. Gradually the work came to be\r\nlooked upon as doubtful, then spurious; and now it is known to be a\r\nforgery, possibly of the first or second century A.D. The scholar--for\r\nhe certainly was one--who took the trouble to forge this work, was\r\nhimself the victim of a strange delusion. He thought that Lieh Tzŭ, to\r\nwhom Chuang Tzŭ devotes a whole chapter, had been a live philosopher of\r\nflesh and blood. But he was in reality nothing more than a figment of\r\nthe imagination, like many others of Chuang Tzŭ’s characters, though\r\nhis name was less broadly allegorical than those of All-in-Extremes,\r\nand of Do-Nothing-Say-Nothing, and others. The book attributed to him\r\nis curious enough to deserve attention. It is on a lower level of\r\nthought and style than the work of Chuang Tzŭ; still, it contains much\r\ntraditional matter and many allusions not found elsewhere. To its\r\nauthor we owe the famous, but of course apocryphal, story of Confucius\r\nmeeting two boys quarrelling about the distance of the sun from the\r\nearth. One of them said that at dawn the sun was much larger than at\r\nnoon, and must consequently be much nearer; but the other retorted that\r\nat noon the sun was much hotter, and therefore nearer than at dawn.\r\nConfucius confessed himself unable to decide between them, and was\r\njeered at by the boys as an impostor. But of all this work perhaps the\r\nmost attractive portion is a short story on Dream and Reality:--\r\n\r\n“A man of the State of Chêng was one day gathering fuel, when he came\r\nacross a startled deer, which he pursued and killed. Fearing lest any\r\none should see him, he hastily concealed the carcass in a ditch and\r\ncovered it with plaintain leaves, rejoicing excessively at his good\r\nfortune. By and by, he forgot the place where he had put it, and,\r\nthinking he must have been dreaming, he set off towards home, humming\r\nover the affair on his way.\r\n\r\n“Meanwhile, a man who had overheard his words, acted upon them, and\r\nwent and got the deer. The latter, when he reached his house, told his\r\nwife, saying, ‘A woodman dreamt he had got a deer, but he did not know\r\nwhere it was. Now I have got the deer; so his dream was a reality.’ ‘It\r\nis you,’ replied his wife, ‘who have been dreaming you saw a woodman.\r\nDid he get the deer? and is there really such a person? It is you who\r\nhave got the deer: how, then, can his dream be a reality?’ ‘It is\r\ntrue,’ assented the husband, ‘that I have got the deer. It is therefore\r\nof little importance whether the woodman dreamt the deer or I dreamt\r\nthe woodman.’\r\n\r\n“Now when the woodman reached his home, he became much annoyed at the\r\nloss of the deer; and in the night he actually dreamt where the deer\r\nthen was, and who had got it. So next morning he proceeded to the place\r\nindicated in his dream,--and there it was. He then took legal steps to\r\nrecover possession; and when the case came on, the magistrate delivered\r\nthe following judgment:--‘The plaintiff began with a real deer and an\r\nalleged dream. He now comes forward with a real dream and an alleged\r\ndeer. The defendant really got the deer which plaintiff said he dreamt,\r\nand is now trying to keep it; while, according to his wife, both the\r\nwoodman and the deer are but the figments of a dream, so that no one\r\ngot the deer at all. However, here is a deer, which you had better\r\ndivide between you.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HAN FEI TZŬ]\r\n\r\nHAN FEI TZŬ, who died B.C. 233, has left us fifty-five essays of\r\nconsiderable value, partly for the light they throw upon the connection\r\nbetween the genuine sayings of Lao Tzŭ and the _Tao-Tê-Ching_, and\r\npartly for the quaint illustrations he gives of the meaning of\r\nthe sayings themselves. He was deeply read in law, and obtained\r\nfavour in the eyes of the First Emperor (see Book II., ch. i.); but\r\nmisrepresentations of rivals brought about his downfall, and he\r\ncommitted suicide in prison. We cannot imagine that he had before him\r\nthe _Tao-Tê-Ching_. He deals with many of its best sayings, which may\r\nwell have come originally from an original teacher, such as Lao Tzŭ is\r\nsupposed to have been, but quite at random and not as if he took them\r\nfrom an orderly work. And what is more, portions of his own commentary\r\nhave actually slipped into the _Tao-Tê-Ching_ as text, showing how\r\nthis book was pieced together from various sources. Again, he quotes\r\nsentences not to be found in the _Tao-Tê-Ching_. He illustrates such a\r\nsimple saying as “To see small beginnings is clearness of sight,” by\r\ndrawing attention to a man who foresaw, when the tyrant Chou Hsin (who\r\ndied B.C. 1122) took to ivory chopsticks, that the tide of luxury had\r\nset in, to bring licentiousness and cruelty in its train, and to end in\r\ndownfall and death.\r\n\r\nLao Tzŭ said, “Leave all things to take their natural course.” To\r\nthis Han Fei Tzŭ adds, “A man spent three years in carving a leaf out\r\nof ivory, of such elegant and detailed workmanship that it would lie\r\nundetected among a heap of real leaves. But Lieh Tzŭ said, ‘If God\r\nAlmighty were to spend three years over every leaf, the trees would be\r\nbadly off for foliage.’”\r\n\r\nLao Tzŭ said, “The wise man takes time by the forelock.” Han Fei Tzŭ\r\nadds, “One day the Court physician said to Duke Huan, ‘Your Grace is\r\nsuffering from an affection of the muscular system. Take care, or it\r\nmay become serious.’ ‘Oh no,’ replied the Duke, ‘I have nothing the\r\nmatter with me;’ and when the physician was gone, he observed to his\r\ncourtiers, ‘Doctors dearly love to treat patients who are not ill, and\r\nthen make capital out of the cure.’ Ten days afterwards, the Court\r\nphysician again remarked, ‘Your Grace has an affection of the flesh.\r\nTake care, or it may become serious.’ The Duke took no notice of\r\nthis, but after ten days more the physician once more observed, ‘Your\r\nGrace has an affection of the viscera. Take care, or it may become\r\nserious.’ Again the Duke paid no heed; and ten days later, when the\r\nphysician came, he simply looked at his royal patient, and departed\r\nwithout saying anything. The Duke sent some one to inquire what was\r\nthe matter, and to him the physician said, ‘As long as the disease\r\nwas in the muscles, it might have been met by fomentations and hot\r\napplications; when it was in the flesh, acupuncture might have been\r\nemployed; and as long as it was in the viscera, cauterisation might\r\nhave been tried; but now it is in the bones and marrow, and naught\r\nwill avail.’ Five days later, the Duke felt pains all over his body,\r\nand sent to summon his physician; but the physician had fled, and the\r\nDuke died. So it is that the skilful doctor attacks disease while it is\r\nstill in the muscles and easy to deal with.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HUAI-NAN TZŬ]\r\n\r\nTo clear off finally this school of early Taoist writers, it will be\r\nnecessary to admit here one whose life properly belongs to the next\r\nperiod. Liu An, a grandson of the founder of the Han dynasty, became\r\nPrince of Huai-nan, and it is as HUAI-NAN TZŬ, the Philosopher\r\nof that ilk, that he is known to the Chinese people. He wrote an\r\nesoteric work in twenty-one chapters, which we are supposed still to\r\npossess, besides many exoteric works, such as a treatise on alchemy,\r\nnone of which are extant. It is fairly certain, however, that alchemy\r\nwas not known to the Chinese until between two and three centuries\r\nlater, when it was introduced from the West. As to the book which\r\npasses under his name, it is difficult to assign to it any exact date.\r\nLike the work of Lieh Tzŭ, it is interesting enough in itself; and\r\nwhat is more important, it marks the transition of the pure and simple\r\nWay of Lao Tzŭ, etherealised by Chuang Tzŭ, to the grosser beliefs\r\nof later ages in magicians and the elixir of life. Lao Tzŭ urged his\r\nfellow-mortals to guard their vitality by entering into harmony with\r\ntheir environment. Chuang Tzŭ added a motive, “to pass into the realm\r\nof the Infinite and make one’s final rest therein.” From which it is\r\nbut a step to immortality and the elixir of life.\r\n\r\nHuai-nan Tzŭ begins with a lengthy disquisition “On the Nature of Tao,”\r\nin which, as elsewhere, he deals with the sayings of Lao Tzŭ after the\r\nfashion of Han Fei Tzŭ. Thus Lao Tzŭ said, “If you do not quarrel, no\r\none on earth will be able to quarrel with you.” To this Huai-nan Tzŭ\r\nadds, that when a certain ruler was besieging an enemy’s town, a large\r\npart of the wall fell down; whereupon the former gave orders to beat a\r\nretreat at once. “For,” said he in reply to the remonstrances of his\r\nofficers, “a gentleman never hits a man who is down. Let them rebuild\r\ntheir wall, and then we will renew the attack.” This noble behaviour so\r\ndelighted the enemy that they tendered allegiance on the spot.\r\n\r\nLao Tzŭ said, “Do not value the man, value his abilities.” Whereupon\r\nHuai-nan Tzŭ tells a story of a general of the Ch‘u State who was fond\r\nof surrounding himself with men of ability, and once even went so far\r\nas to engage a man who represented himself as a master-thief. His\r\nretainers were aghast; but shortly afterwards their State was attacked\r\nby the Ch‘i State, and then, when fortune was adverse and all was on\r\nthe point of being lost, the master-thief begged to be allowed to try\r\nhis skill. He went by night into the enemy’s camp, and stole their\r\ngeneral’s bed-curtain. This was returned next morning with a message\r\nthat it had been found by one of the soldiers who was gathering fuel.\r\nThe same night our master-thief stole the general’s pillow, which was\r\nrestored with a similar message; and the following night he stole the\r\nlong pin used to secure the hair. “Good heavens!” cried the general at\r\na council of war, “they will have my head next.” Upon which the army of\r\nthe Ch‘i State was withdrawn.\r\n\r\nAmong passages of general interest the following may well be quoted:--\r\n\r\n“Once when the Duke of Lu-yang was at war with the Han State, and\r\nsunset drew near while a battle was still fiercely raging, the Duke\r\nheld up his spear, and shook it at the sun, which forthwith went back\r\nthree zodiacal signs.”\r\n\r\nThe end of this philosopher was a tragic one. He seems to have mixed\r\nhimself up in some treasonable enterprise, and was driven to commit\r\nsuicide. Tradition, however, says that he positively discovered the\r\nelixir of immortality, and that after drinking of it he rose up to\r\nheaven in broad daylight. Also that, in his excitement, he dropped the\r\nvessel which had contained this elixir into his courtyard, and that\r\nhis dogs and poultry sipped up the dregs, and immediately sailed up to\r\nheaven after him!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] Tê is the exemplification of Tao.\r\n\r\n[4] The name Lao Tan occurs in four passages in the Book of Rites, but\r\nwe are expressly told that by it is not meant the philosopher Lao Tzŭ.\r\n\r\n[5] “To the minnow, every cranny and pebble and quality and accident of\r\nits little native creek may have become familiar; but does the minnow\r\nunderstand the ocean tides and periodic currents, the trade-winds,\r\nand monsoons, and moon’s eclipses...?”--_Sartor Resartus_, Natural\r\nSupernaturalism.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE SECOND\r\n\r\n_THE HAN DYNASTY_ (B.C. 200--A.D. 200)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE “FIRST EMPEROR”--THE BURNING OF THE BOOKS--MISCELLANEOUS WRITERS\r\n\r\n\r\nNever has the literature of any country been more closely bound up with\r\nthe national history than was that of China at the beginning of the\r\nperiod upon which we are now about to enter.\r\n\r\nThe feudal spirit had long since declined, and the bond between\r\nsuzerain and vassal had grown weaker and weaker until at length it had\r\nceased to exist. Then came the opportunity and the man. The ruler of\r\nthe powerful State of Ch‘in, after gradually vanquishing and absorbing\r\nsuch of the other rival States as had not already been swallowed up\r\nby his own State, found himself in B.C. 221 master of the\r\nwhole of China, and forthwith proclaimed himself its Emperor. The Chou\r\ndynasty, with its eight hundred years of sway, was a thing of the past,\r\nand the whole fabric of feudalism melted easily away.\r\n\r\nThis catastrophe was by no means unexpected. Some forty years\r\npreviously a politician, named Su Tai, was one day advising the King\r\nof Chao to put an end to his ceaseless hostilities with the Yen State.\r\n“This morning,” said he, “when crossing the river, I saw a mussel open\r\nits shell to sun itself. Immediately an oyster-catcher thrust in his\r\nbill to eat the mussel, but the latter promptly closed its shell and\r\nheld the bird fast. ‘If it doesn’t rain to-day or to-morrow,’ cried the\r\noyster-catcher, ‘there will be a dead mussel.’ ‘And if you don’t get\r\nout of this by to-day or to-morrow,’ retorted the mussel, ‘there will\r\nbe a dead oyster-catcher.’ Meanwhile up came a fisherman and carried\r\noff both of them. I fear lest the Ch‘in State should be our fisherman.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LI SSŬ]\r\n\r\nThe new Emperor was in many senses a great man, and civilisation made\r\nconsiderable advances during his short reign. But a single decree has\r\nbranded his name with infamy, to last so long as the Chinese remain\r\na lettered people. In B.C. 13, a trusted Minister, named Li\r\nSsŭ, is said to have suggested an extraordinary plan, by which the\r\nclaims of antiquity were to be for ever blotted out and history was\r\nto begin again with the ruling monarch, thenceforward to be famous\r\nas the First Emperor. All existing literature was to be destroyed,\r\nwith the exception only of works relating to agriculture, medicine,\r\nand divination; and a penalty of branding and four years’ work on\r\nthe Great Wall, then in process of building, was enacted against all\r\nwho refused to surrender their books for destruction. This plan was\r\ncarried out with considerable vigour. Many valuable works perished;\r\nand the Confucian Canon would have been irretrievably lost but for the\r\ndevotion of scholars, who at considerable risk concealed the tablets\r\nby which they set such store, and thus made possible the discoveries\r\nof the following century and the restoration of the sacred text. So\r\nmany, indeed, of the literati are said to have been put to death for\r\ndisobedience that melons actually grew in winter on the spot beneath\r\nwhich their bodies were buried.\r\n\r\nLI SSŬ was a scholar himself, and the reputed inventor of\r\nthe script known as the Lesser Seal, which was in vogue for several\r\ncenturies. The following is from a memorial of his against the\r\nproscription of nobles and others from rival States:--\r\n\r\n“As broad acres yield large crops, so for a nation to be great there\r\nshould be a great population; and for soldiers to be daring their\r\ngenerals should be brave. Not a single clod was added to T‘ai-shan\r\nin vain: hence the huge mountain we now behold. The merest streamlet\r\nis received into the bosom of Ocean: hence the Ocean’s unfathomable\r\nexpanse. And wise and virtuous is the ruler who scorns not the masses\r\nbelow. For him, no boundaries of realm, no distinctions of nationality\r\nexist. The four seasons enrich him; the Gods bless him; and, like our\r\nrulers of old, no man’s hand is against him.”\r\n\r\nThe First Emperor died in B.C. 210,[6] and his feeble son, the\r\nSecond Emperor, was put to death in 207, thus bringing their line to an\r\nend. The vacant throne was won by a quondam beadle, who established the\r\nglorious House of Han, in memory of which Chinese of the present day,\r\nchiefly in the north, are still proud to call themselves Sons of Han.\r\n\r\nSo soon as the empire settled down to comparative peace, a mighty\r\neffort was made to undo at least some of the mischief sustained by the\r\nnational literature. An extra impetus was given to this movement by\r\nthe fact that under the First Emperor, if we can believe tradition,\r\nthe materials of writing had undergone a radical change. A general,\r\nnamed Mêng T‘ien, added to the triumphs of the sword the invention of\r\nthe camel’s-hair brush, which the Chinese use as a pen. The clumsy\r\nbamboo tablet and stylus were discarded, and strips of cloth or silk\r\ncame into general use, and were so employed until the first century\r\nA.D., when paper was invented by Ts‘ai Lun. Some say that\r\nbrickdust and water did duty at first for ink. However that may be, the\r\nform of the written character underwent a corresponding change to suit\r\nthe materials employed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, books were brought out of their hiding-places, and scholars\r\nlike K‘UNG AN-KUO, a descendant of Confucius in the twelfth\r\ndegree, set to work to restore the lost classics. He deciphered the\r\ntext of the Book of History, which had been discovered when pulling\r\ndown the old house where Confucius once lived, and transcribed large\r\nportions of it from the ancient into the later script. He also wrote a\r\ncommentary on the Analects and another on the Filial Piety Classic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n[Sidenote: CH’AO TS’O--LI LING]\r\n\r\nCH’AO TS’O (perished B.C. 155), popularly known as\r\nWisdom-Bag, was a statesman rather than an author. Still, many of his\r\nmemorials to the throne were considered masterpieces, and have been\r\npreserved accordingly. He wrote on the military operations against the\r\nHuns, pleading for the employment of frontier tribes, “barbarians, who\r\nin point of food and skill are closely allied to the Huns.” “But arms,”\r\nhe says, “are a curse, and war is a dread thing. For in the twinkling\r\nof an eye the mighty may be humbled, and the strong may be brought\r\nlow.” In an essay “On the Value of Agriculture” he writes thus:--\r\n\r\n“Crime begins in poverty; poverty in insufficiency of food;\r\ninsufficiency of food in neglect of agriculture. Without agriculture,\r\nman has no tie to bind him to the soil. Without such tie he readily\r\nleaves his birth-place and his home. He is like unto the birds of the\r\nair or the beasts of the field. Neither battlemented cities, nor deep\r\nmoats, nor harsh laws, nor cruel punishments, can subdue this roving\r\nspirit that is strong within him.\r\n\r\n“He who is cold examines not the quality of cloth; he who is hungry\r\ntarries not for choice meats. When cold and hunger come upon men,\r\nhonesty and shame depart. As man is constituted, he must eat twice\r\ndaily, or hunger; he must wear clothes, or be cold. And if the stomach\r\ncannot get food and the body clothes, the love of the fondest mother\r\ncannot keep her children at her side. How then should a sovereign keep\r\nhis subjects gathered around him?\r\n\r\n“The wise ruler knows this. Therefore he concentrates the energies of\r\nhis people upon agriculture. He levies light taxes. He extends the\r\nsystem of grain storage, to provide for his subjects at times when\r\ntheir resources fail.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LI LING]\r\n\r\nThe name of LI LING (second and first centuries B.C.)\r\nis a familiar one to every Chinese schoolboy. He was a military\r\nofficial who was sent in command of 800 horse to reconnoitre the\r\nterritory of the Huns; and returning successful from this expedition,\r\nhe was promoted to a high command and was again employed against\r\nthese troublesome neighbours. With a force of only 5000 infantry he\r\npenetrated into the Hun territory as far as Mount Ling-chi (?), where\r\nhe was surrounded by an army of 30,000 of the Khan’s soldiers; and when\r\nhis troops had exhausted all their arrows, he was forced to surrender.\r\nAt this the Emperor was furious; and later on, when he heard that\r\nLi Ling was training the Khan’s soldiers in the art of war as then\r\npractised by the Chinese, he caused his mother, wife, and children to\r\nbe put to death. Li Ling remained some twenty years, until his death,\r\nwith the Huns, and was highly honoured by the Khan, who gave him his\r\ndaughter to wife.\r\n\r\nWith the renegade Li Ling is associated his patriot contemporary,\r\nSU WU, who also met with strange adventures among the Huns. Several\r\nChinese envoys had been imprisoned by the latter, and not allowed to\r\nreturn; and by way of reprisal, Hun envoys had been imprisoned in\r\nChina. But a new Khan had recently sent back all the imprisoned envoys,\r\nand in A.D. 100 Su Wu was despatched upon a mission of peace to return\r\nthe Hun envoys who had been detained by the Chinese. Whilst at the\r\nCourt of the Khan his fellow-envoys revolted, and on the strength of\r\nthis an attempt was made to persuade him to throw off his allegiance\r\nand enter the service of the Huns; upon which he tried to commit\r\nsuicide, and wounded himself so severely that he lay unconscious for\r\nsome hours. He subsequently slew a Chinese renegade with his own\r\nhand; and then when it was found that he was not to be forced into\r\nsubmission, he was thrown into a dungeon and left without food for\r\nseveral days. He kept himself alive by sucking snow and gnawing a\r\nfelt rug; and at length the Huns, thinking that he was a supernatural\r\nbeing, sent him away north and set him to tend sheep. Then Li Ling was\r\nordered to try once more by brilliant offers to shake his unswerving\r\nloyalty, but all was in vain. In the year 86, peace was made with\r\nthe Huns, and the Emperor asked for the return of Su Wu. To this the\r\nHuns replied that he was dead; but a former assistant to Su Wu bade\r\nthe new envoy tell the Khan that the Emperor had shot a goose with\r\na letter tied to its leg, from which he had learnt the whereabouts\r\nof his missing envoy. This story so astonished the Khan that Su Wu\r\nwas released, and in B.C.. 81 returned to China after a captivity of\r\nnineteen years. He had gone away in the prime of life; he returned a\r\nwhite-haired and broken-down old man.\r\n\r\nLi Ling and Su Wu are said to have exchanged poems at parting, and\r\nthese are to be found published in collections under their respective\r\nnames. Some doubt has been cast upon the genuineness of one of those\r\nattributed to Li Ling. It was pointed out by Hung Mai, a brilliant\r\ncritic of the twelfth century, that a certain word was used in the\r\npoem, which, being part of the personal name of a recent Emperor, would\r\nat that date have been taboo. No such stigma attaches to the verses\r\nby Su Wu, who further gave to his wife a parting poem, which has been\r\npreserved, promising her that if he lived he would not fail to return,\r\nand if he died he would never forget her. But most famous of all, and\r\nstill a common model for students, is a letter written by Li Ling to\r\nSu Wu, after the latter’s return to China, in reply to an affectionate\r\nappeal to him to return also. Its genuineness has been questioned by Su\r\nShih of the Sung dynasty, but not by the greatest of modern critics,\r\nLin Hsi-chung, who declares that its pathos is enough to make even the\r\ngods weep, and that it cannot possibly have come from any other hand\r\nsave that of Li Ling. With this verdict the foreign student may well\r\nrest content. Here is the letter:--\r\n\r\n“O Tzŭ-ch‘ing, O my friend, happy in the enjoyment of a glorious\r\nreputation, happy in the prospect of an imperishable name,--there is\r\nno misery like exile in a far-off foreign land, the heart brimful of\r\nlonging thoughts of home! I have thy kindly letter, bidding me of good\r\ncheer, kinder than a brother’s words; for which my soul thanks thee.\r\n\r\n“Ever since the hour of my surrender until now, destitute of all\r\nresource, I have sat alone with the bitterness of my grief. All day\r\nlong I see none but barbarians around me. Skins and felt protect me\r\nfrom wind and rain. With mutton and whey I satisfy my hunger and slake\r\nmy thirst. Companions with whom to while time away, I have none. The\r\nwhole country is stiff with black ice. I hear naught but the moaning of\r\nthe bitter autumn blast, beneath which all vegetation has disappeared.\r\nI cannot sleep at night. I turn and listen to the distant sound of\r\nTartar pipes, to the whinnying of Tartar steeds. In the morning I sit\r\nup and listen still, while tears course down my cheeks. O Tzŭ-ch‘ing,\r\nof what stuff am I, that I should do aught but grieve? The day of thy\r\ndeparture left me disconsolate indeed. I thought of my aged mother\r\nbutchered upon the threshold of the grave. I thought of my innocent\r\nwife and child, condemned to the same cruel fate. Deserving as I might\r\nhave been of Imperial censure, I am now an object of pity to all. Thy\r\nreturn was to honour and renown, while I remained behind with infamy\r\nand disgrace. Such is the divergence of man’s destiny.\r\n\r\n“Born within the domain of refinement and justice, I passed into\r\nan environment of vulgar ignorance. I left behind me obligations to\r\nsovereign and family for life amid barbarian hordes; and now barbarian\r\nchildren will carry on the line of my forefathers. And yet my merit\r\nwas great, my guilt of small account. I had no fair hearing; and when\r\nI pause to think of these things, I ask to what end I have lived? With\r\na thrust I could have cleared myself of all blame: my severed throat\r\nwould have borne witness to my resolution; and between me and my\r\ncountry all would have been over for aye. But to kill myself would have\r\nbeen of no avail: I should only have added to my shame. I therefore\r\nsteeled myself to obloquy and to life. There were not wanting those who\r\nmistook my attitude for compliance, and urged me to a nobler course;\r\nignorant that the joys of a foreign land are sources only of a keener\r\ngrief.\r\n\r\n“O Tzŭ-ch‘ing, O my friend, I will complete the half-told record of\r\nmy former tale. His late Majesty commissioned me, with five thousand\r\ninfantry under my command, to carry on operations in a distant country.\r\nFive brother generals missed their way: I alone reached the theatre\r\nof war. With rations for a long march, leading on my men, I passed\r\nbeyond the limits of the Celestial Land, and entered the territory of\r\nthe fierce Huns. With five thousand men I stood opposed to a hundred\r\nthousand: mine jaded foot-soldiers, theirs horsemen fresh from the\r\nstable. Yet we slew their leaders, and captured their standards, and\r\ndrove them back in confusion towards the north. We obliterated their\r\nvery traces: we swept them away like dust: we beheaded their general. A\r\nmartial spirit spread abroad among my men. With them, to die in battle\r\nwas to return to their homes; while I--I venture to think that I had\r\nalready accomplished something.\r\n\r\n“This victory was speedily followed by a general rising of the Huns.\r\nNew levies were trained to the use of arms, and at length another\r\nhundred thousand barbarians were arrayed against me. The Hun chieftain\r\nhimself appeared, and with his army surrounded my little band, so\r\nunequal in strength,--foot-soldiers opposed to horse. Still my tired\r\nveterans fought, each man worth a thousand of the foe, as, covered\r\nwith wounds, one and all struggled bravely to the fore. The plain was\r\nstrewed with the dying and the dead: barely a hundred men were left,\r\nand these too weak to hold a spear and shield. Yet, when I waved my\r\nhand and shouted to them, the sick and wounded arose. Brandishing their\r\nblades, and pointing towards the foe, they dismissed the Tartar cavalry\r\nlike a rabble rout. And even when their arms were gone, their arrows\r\nspent, without a foot of steel in their hands, they still rushed,\r\nyelling, onward, each eager to lead the way. The very heavens and the\r\nearth seemed to gather round me, while my warriors drank tears of\r\nblood. Then the Hunnish chieftain, thinking that we should not yield,\r\nwould have drawn off his forces. But a false traitor told him all: the\r\nbattle was renewed, and we were lost.\r\n\r\n“The Emperor Kao Ti, with 300,000 men at his back, was shut up in\r\nP‘ing-ch‘êng. Generals he had, like clouds; counsellors, like drops of\r\nrain. Yet he remained seven days without food, and then barely escaped\r\nwith life. How much more then I, now blamed on all sides that I did\r\nnot die? This was my crime. But, O Tzŭ-ch‘ing, canst thou say that I\r\nwould live from craven fear of death? Am I one to turn my back on my\r\ncountry and all those dear to me, allured by sordid thoughts of gain?\r\nIt was not indeed without cause that I did not elect to die. I longed,\r\nas explained in my former letter, to prove my loyalty to my prince.\r\nRather than die to no purpose, I chose to live and to establish my good\r\nname. It was better to achieve something than to perish. Of old, Fan Li\r\ndid not slay himself after the battle of Hui-chi; neither did Ts‘ao Mo\r\ndie after the ignominy of three defeats. Revenge came at last; and thus\r\nI too had hoped to prevail. Why then was I overtaken with punishment\r\nbefore the plan was matured? Why were my own flesh and blood condemned\r\nbefore the design could be carried out? It is for this that I raise my\r\nface to Heaven, and beating my breast, shed tears of blood.\r\n\r\n“O my friend, thou sayest that the House of Han never fails to reward a\r\ndeserving servant. But thou art thyself a servant of the House, and it\r\nwould ill beseem thee to say other words than these. Yet Hsiao and Fan\r\nwere bound in chains; Han and P‘êng were sliced to death; Ch‘ao Ts‘o\r\nwas beheaded. Chou Po was disgraced, and Tou Ying paid the penalty with\r\nhis life. Others, great in their generation, have also succumbed to the\r\nintrigues of base men, and have been overwhelmed beneath a weight of\r\nshame from which they were unable to emerge. And now, the misfortunes\r\nof Fan Li and Ts‘ao Mo command the sympathies of all.\r\n\r\n“My grandfather filled heaven and earth with the fame of his\r\nexploits--the bravest of the brave. Yet, fearing the animosity of an\r\nImperial favourite, he slew himself in a distant land, his death being\r\nfollowed by the secession, in disgust, of many a brother-hero. Can this\r\nbe the reward of which thou speakest?\r\n\r\n“Thou too, O my friend, an envoy with a slender equipage, sent on that\r\nmission to the robber race, when fortune failed thee even to the last\r\nresource of the dagger. Then years of miserable captivity, all but\r\nended by death among the wilds of the far north. Thou left us full of\r\nyoung life, to return a graybeard; thy old mother dead, thy wife gone\r\nfrom thee to another. Seldom has the like of this been known. Even the\r\nsavage barbarian respected thy loyal spirit: how much more the lord\r\nof all under the canopy of the sky? A many-acred barony should have\r\nbeen thine, the ruler of a thousand-charioted fief! Nevertheless, they\r\ntell me ’twas but two paltry millions, and the chancellorship of the\r\nTributary States. Not a foot of soil repaid thee for the past, while\r\nsome cringing courtier gets the marquisate of ten thousand families,\r\nand each greedy parasite of the Imperial house is gratified by the\r\nchoicest offices of the State. If then thou farest thus, what could I\r\nexpect? I have been heavily repaid for that I did not die. Thou hast\r\nbeen meanly rewarded for thy unswerving devotion to thy prince. This\r\nis barely that which should attract the absent servant back to his\r\nfatherland.\r\n\r\n“And so it is that I do not now regret the past. Wanting though I\r\nmay have been in my duty to the State, the State was wanting also in\r\ngratitude towards me. It was said of old, ‘A loyal subject, though not\r\na hero, will rejoice to die for his country.’ I would die joyfully even\r\nnow; but the stain of my prince’s ingratitude can never be wiped away.\r\nIndeed, if the brave man is not to be allowed to achieve a name, but\r\nmust die like a dog in a barbarian land, who will be found to crook the\r\nback and bow the knee before an Imperial throne, where the bitter pens\r\nof courtiers tell their lying tales?\r\n\r\n“O my friend, look for me no more. O Tzŭ-ch‘ing, what shall I say? A\r\nthousand leagues lie between us, and separate us for ever. I shall live\r\nout my life as it were in another sphere: my spirit will find its home\r\namong a strange people. Accept my last adieu. Speak for me to my old\r\nacquaintances, and bid them serve their sovereign well. O my friend,\r\nbe happy in the bosom of thy family, and think of me no more. Strive\r\nto take all care of thyself; and when time and opportunity are thine,\r\nwrite me once again in reply.\r\n\r\n“Li Ling salutes thee!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LU WÊN-SHU]\r\n\r\nOne of the Chinese models of self-help alluded to in the _San Tzŭ\r\nChing_, the famous school primer, to be described later on, is LU\r\nWÊN-SHU (first century B.C.). The son of a village gaoler, he was sent\r\nby his father to tend sheep, in which capacity he seems to have formed\r\nsheets of writing material by plaiting rushes, and otherwise to have\r\nsucceeded in educating himself. He became an assistant in a prison,\r\nand there the knowledge of law which he had picked up stood him in\r\nsuch good stead that he was raised to a higher position; and then,\r\nattracting the notice of the governor, he was still further advanced,\r\nand finally took his degree, ultimately rising to the rank of governor.\r\nIn B.C. 67 he submitted to the throne the following well-known\r\nmemorial:--\r\n\r\n“May it please your Majesty.\r\n\r\n“Of the ten great follies of our predecessors, one still survives in\r\nthe maladministration of justice which prevails.\r\n\r\n“Under the Ch‘ins learning was at a discount; brute force carried\r\neverything before it. Those who cultivated a spirit of charity and duty\r\ntowards their neighbour were despised. Judicial appointments were\r\nthe prizes coveted by all. He who spoke out the truth was stigmatised\r\nas a slanderer, and he who strove to expose abuses was set down as a\r\npestilent fellow. Consequently all who acted up to the precepts of our\r\nancient code found themselves out of place in their generation, and\r\nloyal words of good advice to the sovereign remained locked up within\r\ntheir bosoms, while hollow notes of obsequious flattery soothed the\r\nmonarch’s ear and lulled his heart with false images, to the exclusion\r\nof disagreeable realities. And so the rod of empire fell from their\r\ngrasp for ever.\r\n\r\n“At the present moment the State rests upon the immeasurable bounty and\r\ngoodness of your Majesty. We are free from the horrors of war, from the\r\ncalamities of hunger and cold. Father and son, husband and wife, are\r\nunited in their happy homes. Nothing is wanting to make this a golden\r\nage save only reform in the administration of justice.\r\n\r\n“Of all trusts, this is the greatest and most sacred. The dead man\r\ncan never come back to life: that which is once cut off cannot be\r\njoined again. ‘Rather than slay an innocent man, it were better that\r\nthe guilty escape.’ Such, however, is not the view of our judicial\r\nauthorities of to-day. With them, oppression and severity are reckoned\r\nto be signs of magisterial acumen and lead on to fortune, whereas\r\nleniency entails naught but trouble. Therefore their chief aim is to\r\ncompass the death of their victims; not that they entertain any grudge\r\nagainst humanity in general, but simply that this is the shortest cut\r\nto their own personal advantage. Thus, our market-places run with\r\nblood, our criminals throng the gaols, and many thousands annually\r\nsuffer death. These things are injurious to public morals and hinder\r\nthe advent of a truly golden age.\r\n\r\n“Man enjoys life only when his mind is at peace; when he is in\r\ndistress, his thoughts turn towards death. Beneath the scourge what is\r\nthere that cannot be wrung from the lips of the sufferer? His agony is\r\noverwhelming, and he seeks to escape by speaking falsely. The officials\r\nprofit by the opportunity, and cause him to say what will best confirm\r\nhis guilt. And then, fearing lest the conviction be quashed by higher\r\ncourts, they dress the victim’s deposition to suit the circumstances of\r\nthe case, so that, when the record is complete, even were Kao Yao[7]\r\nhimself to rise from the dead, he would declare that death still left\r\na margin of unexpiated crime. This, because of the refining process\r\nadopted to ensure the establishment of guilt.\r\n\r\n“Our magistrates indeed think of nothing else. They are the bane of\r\nthe people. They keep in view their own ends, and care not for the\r\nwelfare of the State. Truly they are the worst criminals of the age.\r\nHence the saying now runs, ‘Chalk out a prison on the ground, and no\r\none would remain within. Set up a gaoler of wood, and he will be found\r\nstanding there alone.’[8] Imprisonment has become the greatest of all\r\nmisfortunes, while among those who break the law, who violate family\r\nties, who choke the truth, there are none to be compared in iniquity\r\nwith the officers of justice themselves.\r\n\r\n“Where you let the kite rear its young undisturbed, there will the\r\nphœnix come and build its nest. Do not punish for misguided advice,\r\nand by and by valuable suggestions will flow in. The men of old said,\r\n‘Hills and jungles shelter many noxious things; rivers and marshes\r\nreceive much filth; even the finest gems are not wholly without flaw.\r\nSurely then the ruler of an empire should put up with a little abuse.’\r\nBut I would have your Majesty exempt from vituperation, and open to the\r\nadvice of all who have aught to say. I would have freedom of speech\r\nin the advisers of the throne. I would sweep away the errors which\r\nbrought the downfall of our predecessors. I would have reverence for\r\nthe virtues of our ancient kings and reform in the administration of\r\njustice, to the utter confusion of those who now pervert its course.\r\nThen indeed would the golden age be renewed over the face of the glad\r\nearth, and the people would move ever onwards in peace and happiness\r\nboundless as the sky itself.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLIU HSIANG (B.C. 80-89) was a descendant of the\r\nbeadle founder of the great Han dynasty. Entering into official life,\r\nhe sought to curry favour with the reigning Emperor by submitting\r\nsome secret works on the black art, towards which his Majesty was\r\nmuch inclined. The results not proving successful, he was thrown into\r\nprison, but was soon released that he might carry on the publication of\r\nthe commentary on the Spring and Autumn by Ku-liang. He also revised\r\nand re-arranged the historical episodes known as the _Chan Kuo Ts‘ê_,\r\nwrote treatises on government and some poetry, and compiled Biographies\r\nof Eminent Women, the first work of its kind.\r\n\r\nHis son, LIU HSIN, was a precocious boy, who early\r\ndistinguished himself by wide reading in all branches of literature.\r\nHe worked with his father upon the restoration of the classical\r\ntexts, especially of the Book of Changes, and later on was chiefly\r\ninstrumental in establishing the position of Tso’s Commentary on\r\nthe Spring and Autumn. He catalogued the Imperial Library, and in\r\nconjunction with his father discovered--some say compiled--the Chou\r\nRitual.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: YANG HSIUNG]\r\n\r\nA well-known figure in Chinese literature is YANG HSIUNG (B.C.\r\n53-A.D. 18). As a boy he was fond of straying from the beaten track\r\nand reading whatever he could lay his hands on. He stammered badly,\r\nand consequently gave much time to meditation. He propounded an\r\nethical criterion occupying a middle place between those insisted\r\nupon by Mencius and by Hsün K‘uang, teaching that the nature of man\r\nat birth is neither good nor evil, but a mixture of both, and that\r\ndevelopment in either direction depends wholly upon environment. In\r\nglorification of the Book of Changes he wrote the _T‘ai Hsüan Ching_,\r\nand to emphasise the value of the Confucian Analects he produced a\r\nphilosophical treatise known as the _Fa Yen_, both between A.D. 1 and\r\n6. On completion of this last, his most famous work, a wealthy merchant\r\nof the province was so struck by its excellence that he offered to\r\ngive 100,000 _cash_ if his name should merely be mentioned in it. But\r\nYang answered with scorn that a stag in a pen or an ox in a cage would\r\nnot be more out of place than the name of a man with nothing but money\r\nto recommend him in the sacred pages of a book. Liu Hsin, however,\r\nsneeringly suggested that posterity would use Yang Hsiung’s work to\r\ncover pickle-jars.\r\n\r\nBesides composing some mediocre poetry, Yang Hsiung wrote on\r\nacupuncture, music, and philology. There is little doubt that he did\r\nnot write the _Fang Yen_, a vocabulary of words and phrases used in\r\nvarious parts of the empire, which was steadily attributed to him until\r\nHung Mai, a critic of the twelfth century, already mentioned in Chapter\r\nI. of this Book, made short work of his claims.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA brilliant writer who attracted much attention in his day was WANG\r\nCH’UNG (A.D. 27-97). He is said to have picked up his education at\r\nbookstalls, with the aid of a superbly retentive memory. Only one of\r\nhis works is extant, the _Lun Hêng_, consisting of eighty-five essays\r\non a variety of subjects. In these he tilts against the errors of the\r\nage, and exposes even Confucius and Mencius to free and searching\r\ncriticisms. He is consequently ranked as a heterodox thinker. He\r\nshowed that the soul could neither exist after death as a spirit nor\r\nexercise any influence upon the living. When the body decomposes, the\r\nsoul, a phenomenon inseparable from vitality, perishes with it. He\r\nfurther argued that if the souls of human beings were immortal, those\r\nof animals would be immortal likewise; and that space itself would not\r\nsuffice to contain the countless shades of the men and creatures of all\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nMA JUNG (A.D. 79-166) was popularly known as the Universal Scholar. His\r\nlearning in Confucian lore was profound, and he taught upwards of one\r\nthousand pupils. He introduced the system of printing notes or comments\r\nin the body of the page, using for that purpose smaller characters cut\r\nin double columns; and it was by a knowledge of this fact that a clever\r\ncritic of the T‘ang dynasty was able to settle the spuriousness of an\r\nearly edition of the _Tao-Tê-Ching_ with double-column commentary,\r\nwhich had been attributed to Ho Shang Kung, a writer of the second\r\ncentury B.C.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TS’AI YUNG--CHÊNG HSÜAN]\r\n\r\nTS’AI YUNG (A.D. 133-192), whose tippling propensities earned for him\r\nthe nickname of the Drunken Dragon, is chiefly remembered in connection\r\nwith literature as superintending the work of engraving on stone the\r\nauthorised text of the Five Classics. With red ink he wrote these out\r\non forty-six tablets for the workmen to cut. The tablets were placed\r\nin the Hung-tu College, and fragments of them are said to be still in\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nThe most famous of the pupils who sat at the feet of Ma Jung was CHÊNG\r\nHSÜAN (A.D. 127-200). He is one of the most voluminous of all the\r\ncommentators upon the Confucian classics. He lived for learning. The\r\nvery slave-girls of his household were highly educated, and interlarded\r\ntheir conversation with quotations from the Odes. He was nevertheless\r\nfond of wine, and is said to have been able to take three hundred\r\ncups at a sitting without losing his head. Perhaps it may be as well\r\nto add that a Chinese cup holds about a thimbleful. As an instance of\r\nthe general respect in which he was held, it is recorded that at his\r\nrequest the chief of certain rebels spared the town of Kao-mi (his\r\nnative place), marching forward by another route. In A.D. 200 Confucius\r\nappeared to him in a vision, and he knew by this token that his hour\r\nwas at hand. Consequently, he was very loth to respond to a summons\r\nsent to him from Chi-chou in Chihli by the then powerful Yüan Shao. He\r\nset out indeed upon the journey, but died on the way.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to bring the above writers, representatives of\r\na class, individually to the notice of the reader. Though each\r\none wandered into by-paths of his own, the common lode-star was\r\nConfucianism--elucidation of the Confucian Canon. For although,\r\nwith us, commentaries upon the classics are not usually regarded as\r\nliterature, they are so regarded by the Chinese, who place such works\r\nin the very highest rank, and reward successful commentators with the\r\ncoveted niche in the Confucian temple.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[6] An account of the mausoleum built to receive his remains will be\r\nfound in Chapter iii. of this Book.\r\n\r\n[7] A famous Minister of Crime in the mythical ages.\r\n\r\n[8] Contrary to what was actually the case in the Golden Age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nPOETRY\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the second century B.C., poetry was still composed\r\non the model of the _Li Sao_, and we are in possession of a number\r\nof works assigned to Chia I (B.C. 199-168), Tung-fang So (_b._ B.C.\r\n160), Liu Hsiang, and others, all of which follow on the lines of Ch‘ü\r\nYüan’s great poem. But gradually, with the more definite establishment\r\nof what we may call classical influence, poets went back to find\r\ntheir exemplars in the Book of Poetry, which came as it were from the\r\nvery hand of Confucius himself. Poems were written in metres of four,\r\nfive, and seven words to a line. Ssŭ-ma Hsiang-ju (_d._ B.C. 117), a\r\ngay Lothario who eloped with a young widow, made such a name with his\r\nverses that he was summoned to Court, and appointed by the Emperor to\r\nhigh office. His poems, however, have not survived.\r\n\r\nMEI SHÊNG (_d._ B.C. 140), who formed his style\r\non Ssŭ-ma, has the honour of being the first to bring home to his\r\nfellow-countrymen the extreme beauty of the five-word metre. From him\r\nmodern poetry may be said to date. Many specimens of his workmanship\r\nare extant:--\r\n\r\n  (1.) “_Green grows the grass upon the bank,\r\n  The willow-shoots are long and lank;\r\n  A lady in a glistening gown\r\n  Opens the casement and looks down\r\n  The roses on her cheek blush bright,\r\n  Her rounded arm is dazzling white;\r\n  A singing-girl in early life,\r\n  And now a careless roué’s wife....\r\n  Ah, if he does not mind his own,\r\n  He’ll find some day the bird has flown!_”\r\n\r\n  (2.) “_The red hibiscus and the reed,\r\n  The fragrant flowers of marsh and mead,\r\n  All these I gather as I stray,\r\n  As though for one now far away.\r\n  I strive to pierce with straining eyes\r\n  The distance that between us lies.\r\n  Alas that hearts which beat as one\r\n  Should thus be parted and undone!_”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LIU-HÊNG--LIU CH’Ê]\r\n\r\nLIU HÊNG (_d_. B.C. 157) was the son by a concubine\r\nof the founder of the Han dynasty, and succeeded in B.C.\r\n180 as fourth Emperor of the line. For over twenty years he ruled\r\nwisely and well. He is one of the twenty-four classical examples of\r\nfilial piety, having waited on his sick mother for three years without\r\nchanging his clothes. He was a scholar, and was canonised after death\r\nby a title which may fairly be rendered “Beauclerc.” The following is a\r\npoem which he wrote on the death of his illustrious father, who, if we\r\ncan accept as genuine the remains attributed to him, was himself also a\r\npoet:--\r\n\r\n  “_I look up, the curtains are there as of yore;\r\n  I look down, and there is the mat on the floor;\r\n  These things I behold, but the man is no more._\r\n\r\n  “_To the infinite azure his spirit has flown,\r\n  And I am left friendless, uncared-for, alone,\r\n  Of solace bereft, save to weep and to moan._\r\n\r\n  “_The deer on the hillside caressingly bleat,\r\n  And offer the grass for their young ones to eat,\r\n  While birds of the air to their nestlings bring meat_\r\n\r\n  “_But I a poor orphan must ever remain,\r\n  My heart, still so young, overburdened with pain\r\n  For him I shall never set eyes on again._\r\n\r\n  “_’Tis a well-worn old saying, which all men allow,\r\n  That grief stamps the deepest of lines on the brow:\r\n  Alas for my hair, it is silvery now!_\r\n\r\n  “_Alas for my father, cut off in his pride!\r\n  Alas that no more I may stand by his side!\r\n  Oh, where were the gods when that great hero died?_”\r\n\r\nThe literary fame of the Beauclerc was rivalled, if not surpassed, by\r\nhis grandson, LIU CH’Ê (B.C. 156-87), who succeeded in B.C. 140 as\r\nsixth Emperor of the Han dynasty. He was an enthusiastic patron of\r\nliterature. He devoted great attention to music as a factor in national\r\nlife. He established important religious sacrifices to heaven and\r\nearth. He caused the calendar to be reformed by his grand astrologer,\r\nthe historian SSŬ-MA CH’IEN, from which date accurate chronology\r\nmay be almost said to begin. His generals carried the Imperial arms\r\ninto Central Asia, and for many years the Huns were held in check.\r\nNotwithstanding his enlightened policy, the Emperor was personally\r\nmuch taken up with the magic and mysteries which were being gradually\r\ngrafted on to the Tao of Lao Tzŭ, and he encouraged the numerous quacks\r\nwho pretended to have discovered the elixir of life. The following are\r\nspecimens of his skill in poetry:--\r\n\r\n  “_The autumn blast drives the white scud in the sky,\r\n  Leaves fade, and wild geese sweeping south meet the eye;\r\n  The scent of late flowers fills the soft air above.\r\n  My heart full of thoughts of the lady I love.\r\n  In the river the barges for revel-carouse\r\n  Are lined by white waves which break over their bows;\r\n  Their oarsmen keep time to the piping and drumming....\r\n          Yet joy is as naught\r\n          Alloyed by the thought\r\n  That youth slips away and that old age is coming._”\r\n\r\nThe next lines were written upon the death of a harem favourite, to\r\nwhom he was fondly attached:--\r\n\r\n  “_The sound of rustling silk is stilled,\r\n  With dust the marble courtyard filled;\r\n  No footfalls echo on the floor,\r\n  Fallen leaves in heaps block up the door....\r\n  For she, my pride, my lovely one, is lost,\r\n  And I am left, in hopeless anguish tossed._”\r\n\r\nA good many anonymous poems have come down to us from the first century\r\nB.C., and some of these contain here and there quaint and\r\npleasing conceits, as, for instance--\r\n\r\n  “_Man reaches scarce a hundred, yet his tears\r\n  Would fill a lifetime of a thousand years._”\r\n\r\nThe following is a poem of this period, the author of which is\r\nunknown:--\r\n\r\n  “_Forth from the eastern gate my steeds I drive,\r\n  And lo! a cemetery meets my view;\r\n  Aspens around in wild luxuriance thrive,\r\n  The road is fringed with fir and pine and yew.\r\n  Beneath my feet lie the forgotten dead,\r\n  Wrapped in a twilight of eternal gloom;\r\n  Down by the Yellow Springs their earthy bed,\r\n  And everlasting silence is their doom.\r\n  How fast the lights and shadows come and go!\r\n  Like morning dew our fleeting life has passed;\r\n  Man, a poor traveller on earth below,\r\n  Is gone, while brass and stone can still outlast.\r\n  Time is inexorable, and in vain\r\n  Against his might the holiest mortal strives;\r\n  Can we then hope this precious boon to gain,\r\n  By strange elixirs to prolong our lives?...\r\n  Oh, rather quaff good liquor while we may,\r\n  And dress in silk and satin every day!_”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE LADY PAN]\r\n\r\nWomen now begin to appear in Chinese literature. The Lady PAN\r\nwas for a long time chief favourite of the Emperor who ruled China\r\nB.C. 32-6. So devoted was his Majesty that he even wished her\r\nto appear alongside of him in the Imperial chariot. Upon which she\r\nreplied, “Your handmaid has heard that wise rulers of old were always\r\naccompanied by virtuous ministers, but never that they drove out with\r\nwomen by their side.” She was ultimately supplanted by a younger and\r\nmore beautiful rival, whereupon she forwarded to the Emperor one of\r\nthose fans, round or octagonal frames of bamboo with silk stretched\r\nover them,[9] which in this country are called “fire-screens,”\r\ninscribed with the following lines:--\r\n\r\n  “_O fair white silk, fresh from the weaver’s loom,\r\n  Clear as the frost, bright as the winter snow--\r\n  See! friendship fashions out of thee a fan,\r\n  Round as the round moon shines in heaven above,\r\n  At home, abroad, a close companion thou,\r\n  Stirring at every move the grateful gale.\r\n  And yet I fear, ah me! that autumn chills,\r\n  Cooling the dying summer’s torrid rage,\r\n  Will see thee laid neglected on the shelf,\r\n  All thought of bygone days, like them bygone._”\r\n\r\nThe phrase “autumn fan” has long since passed into the language, and is\r\nused figuratively of a deserted wife.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[9] The folding fan, invented by the Japanese, was not known in China\r\nuntil the eleventh century A.D., when it was introduced\r\nthrough Korea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nHISTORY--LEXICOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SSŬ-MA CH’IEN]\r\n\r\nSo far as China is concerned, the art of writing history may be said\r\nto have been created during the period under review. SSŬ-MA CH’IEN,\r\nthe so-called Father of History, was born about B.C. 145. At the age\r\nof ten he was already a good scholar, and at twenty set forth upon a\r\nround of travel which carried him to all parts of the empire. In B.C.\r\n110 his father died, and he stepped into the hereditary post of grand\r\nastrologer. After devoting some time and energy to the reformation of\r\nthe calendar, he now took up the historical work which had been begun\r\nby his father, and which was ultimately given to the world as the\r\nHistorical Record. It is a history of China from the earliest ages down\r\nto about one hundred years before the Christian era, in one hundred and\r\nthirty chapters, arranged under five headings, as follows:--(1) Annals\r\nof the Emperors; (2) Chronological Tables; (3) Eight chapters on Rites,\r\nMusic, the Pitch-pipes, the Calendar, Astrology, Imperial Sacrifices,\r\nWatercourses, and Political Economy; (4) Annals of the Feudal Nobles;\r\nand (5) Biographies of many of the eminent men of the period, which\r\ncovers nearly three thousand years. In such estimation is this work\r\njustly held that its very words have been counted, and found to number\r\n526,500 in all. It must be borne in mind that these characters were,\r\nin all probability, scratched with a stylus on bamboo tablets, and that\r\nprevious to this there was no such thing as a history on a general and\r\ncomprehensive plan; in fact, nothing beyond mere local annals in the\r\nstyle of the Spring and Autumn.\r\n\r\nSince the Historical Record, every dynasty has had its historian, their\r\nworks in all cases being formed upon the model bequeathed by Ssŭ-ma\r\nCh‘ien. The Twenty-four Dynastic Histories of China were produced in\r\n1747 in a uniform series bound up in 219 large volumes, and together\r\nshow a record such as can be produced by no other country in the world.\r\n\r\nThe following are specimens of Ssŭ-ma Ch‘ien’s style:--\r\n\r\n(1.) “When the House of Han arose, the evils of their predecessors had\r\nnot passed away. Husbands still went off to the wars. The old and the\r\nyoung were employed in transporting food. Production was almost at a\r\nstandstill, and money became scarce. So much so, that even the Son of\r\nHeaven had not carriage-horses of the same colour; the highest civil\r\nand military authorities rode in bullock-carts, and the people at large\r\nknew not where to lay their heads.\r\n\r\n“At this epoch, the coinage in use was so heavy and cumbersome that\r\nthe people themselves started a new issue at a fixed standard of\r\nvalue. But the laws were too lax, and it was impossible to prevent\r\ngrasping persons from coining largely, buying largely, and then holding\r\nagainst a rise in the market. The consequence was that prices went up\r\nenormously. Rice sold at 10,000 _cash_ per picul; a horse cost 100\r\nounces of silver. But by and by, when the empire was settling down to\r\ntranquillity, his Majesty Kao Tsu gave orders that no trader should\r\nwear silk nor ride in a carriage; besides which, the imposts levied\r\nupon this class were greatly increased, in order to keep them down.\r\nSome years later these restrictions were withdrawn; still, however,\r\nthe descendants of traders were disqualified from holding any office\r\nconnected with the State.\r\n\r\n“Meanwhile, certain levies were made on a scale calculated to meet\r\nthe exigencies of public expenditure; while the land-tax and customs\r\nrevenue were regarded by all officials, from the Emperor downwards,\r\nas their own personal emolument. Grain was forwarded by water to the\r\ncapital for the use of the officials there, but the quantity did not\r\namount to more than a few hundred thousand piculs every year.\r\n\r\n“Gradually the coinage began to deteriorate and light coins to\r\ncirculate; whereupon another issue followed, each piece being marked\r\n‘half an ounce.’ But at length the system of private issues led\r\nto serious abuses, resulting first of all in vast sums of money\r\naccumulating in the hands of individuals; finally, in rebellion, until\r\nthe country was flooded with the coinage of the rebels, and it became\r\nnecessary to enact laws against any such issues in the future.\r\n\r\n“At this period the Huns were harassing our northern frontier, and\r\nsoldiers were massed there in large bodies; in consequence of which\r\nfood became so scarce that the authorities offered certain rank and\r\ntitles of honour to those who would supply a given quantity of grain.\r\nLater on, drought ensued in the west, and in order to meet necessities\r\nof the moment, official rank was again made a marketable commodity,\r\nwhile those who broke the laws were allowed to commute their penalties\r\nby money payments. And now horses began to reappear in official\r\nstables, and in palace and hall signs of an ampler luxury were visible\r\nonce more.\r\n\r\n“Thus it was in the early days of the dynasty, until some seventy years\r\nafter the accession of the House of Han. The empire was then at peace.\r\nFor a long time there had been neither flood nor drought, and a season\r\nof plenty had ensued. The public granaries were well stocked; the\r\nGovernment treasuries were full. In the capital, strings of _cash_ were\r\npiled in myriads, until the very strings rotted, and their tale could\r\nno longer be told. The grain in the Imperial storehouses grew mouldy\r\nyear by year. It burst from the crammed granaries, and lay about until\r\nit became unfit for human food. The streets were thronged with horses\r\nbelonging to the people, and on the highroads whole droves were to be\r\nseen, so that it became necessary to prohibit the public use of mares.\r\nVillage elders ate meat and drank wine. Petty government clerkships\r\nand the like lapsed from father to son; the higher offices of State\r\nwere treated as family heirlooms. For there had gone abroad a spirit of\r\nself-respect and of reverence for the law, while a sense of charity and\r\nof duty towards one’s neighbour kept men aloof from disgrace and shame.\r\n\r\n“At length, under lax laws, the wealthy began to use their riches for\r\nevil purposes of pride and self-aggrandisement and oppression of the\r\nweak. Members of the Imperial family received grants of land, while\r\nfrom the highest to the lowest, every one vied with his neighbour in\r\nlavishing money on houses, and appointments, and apparel, altogether\r\nbeyond the limit of his means. Such is the everlasting law of the\r\nsequence of prosperity and decay.\r\n\r\n“Then followed extensive military preparations in various parts of\r\nthe empire; the establishment of a tradal route with the barbarians\r\nof the south-west, for which purpose mountains were hewn through\r\nfor many miles. The object was to open up the resources of those\r\nremote districts, but the result was to swamp the inhabitants in\r\nhopeless ruin. Then, again, there was the subjugation of Korea; its\r\ntransformation into an Imperial dependency; with other troubles nearer\r\nhome. There was the ambush laid for the Huns, by which we forfeited\r\ntheir alliance, and brought them down upon our northern frontier.\r\nNothing, in fact, but wars and rumours of wars from day to day.\r\nMoney was constantly leaving the country. The financial stability of\r\nthe empire was undermined, and its impoverished people were driven\r\nthereby into crime. Wealth had been frittered away, and its renewal\r\nwas sought in corruption. Those who brought money in their hands\r\nreceived appointments under government. Those who could pay escaped\r\nthe penalties of their guilt. Merit had to give way to money. Shame\r\nand scruples of conscience were laid aside. Laws and punishments were\r\nadministered with severer hand. From this period must be dated the rise\r\nand growth of official venality.”\r\n\r\n(2.) “The Odes have it thus:--‘We may gaze up to the mountain’s brow:\r\nwe may travel along the great road;’ signifying that although we cannot\r\nhope to reach the goal, still we may push on thitherwards in spirit.\r\n\r\n“While reading the works of Confucius, I have always fancied I\r\ncould see the man as he was in life; and when I went to Shantung I\r\nactually beheld his carriage, his robes, and the material parts of his\r\nceremonial usages. There were his descendants practising the old rites\r\nin their ancestral home, and I lingered on, unable to tear myself\r\naway. Many are the princes and prophets that the world has seen in\r\nits time, glorious in life, forgotten in death. But Confucius, though\r\nonly a humble member of the cotton-clothed masses, remains among us\r\nafter many generations. He is the model for such as would be wise. By\r\nall, from the Son of Heaven down to the meanest student, the supremacy\r\nof his principles is fully and freely admitted. He may indeed be\r\npronounced the divinest of men.”\r\n\r\n(3.) “In the 9th moon the First Emperor was buried in Mount Li, which\r\nin the early days of his reign he had caused to be tunnelled and\r\nprepared with that view. Then, when he had consolidated the empire,\r\nhe employed his soldiery, to the number of 700,000, to bore down to\r\nthe Three Springs (that is, until water was reached), and there a\r\nfoundation of bronze[10] was laid and the sarcophagus placed thereon.\r\nRare objects and costly jewels were collected from the palaces and from\r\nthe various officials, and were carried thither and stored in vast\r\nquantities. Artificers were ordered to construct mechanical cross-bows,\r\nwhich, if any one were to enter, would immediately discharge their\r\narrows. With the aid of quicksilver, rivers were made, the Yang-tsze,\r\nthe Hoang-ho, and the great ocean, the metal being poured from one into\r\nthe other by machinery. On the roof were delineated the constellations\r\nof the sky, on the floor the geographical divisions of the earth.\r\nCandles were made from the fat of the man-fish (walrus), calculated to\r\nlast for a very long time.\r\n\r\n“The Second Emperor said, ‘It is not fitting that the concubines of\r\nmy late father who are without children should leave him now;’ and\r\naccordingly he ordered them to accompany the dead monarch to the next\r\nworld, those who thus perished being many in number.\r\n\r\n“When the interment was completed, some one suggested that the workmen\r\nwho had made the machinery and concealed the treasure knew the great\r\nvalue of the latter, and that the secret would leak out. Therefore,\r\nso soon as the ceremony was over, and the path giving access to the\r\nsarcophagus had been blocked up at its innermost end, the outside\r\ngate at the entrance to this path was let fall, and the mausoleum was\r\neffectually closed, so that not one of the workmen escaped. Trees and\r\ngrass were then planted around, that the spot might look like the rest\r\nof the mountain.”\r\n\r\nThe history by Ssŭ-ma Ch‘ien stops about 100 years before Christ. To\r\ncarry it on from that point was the ambition of a scholar named Pan\r\nPiao (A.D. 3-54), but he died while still collecting materials\r\nfor his task. His son, PAN KU, whose scholarship was extensive\r\nand profound, took up the project, but was impeached on the ground that\r\nhe was altering the national records at his own discretion, and was\r\nthrown into prison. Released on the representations of a brother, he\r\ncontinued his work; however, before its completion he became involved\r\nin a political intrigue and was again thrown into prison, where he\r\ndied. The Emperor handed the unfinished history to PAN CHAO,\r\nhis gifted sister, who had been all along his assistant, and by her it\r\nwas brought to completion down to about the Christian era, where the\r\noccupancy of the throne by a usurper divides the Han dynasty into two\r\ndistinct periods. This lady was also the author of a volume of moral\r\nadvice to young women, and of many poems and essays.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HSÜ SHÊN]\r\n\r\nLexicography, which has since been so widely cultivated by the Chinese,\r\nwas called into being by a famous scholar named HSÜ SHÊN (_d._\r\nA.D. 120). Entering upon an official career, he soon retired\r\nand devoted the rest of his life to books. He was a deep student of the\r\nFive Classics, and wrote a work on the discrepancies in the various\r\ncriticisms of these books. But it is by his _Shuo Wên_ that he is now\r\nknown. This was a collection, with short explanatory notes, of all\r\nthe characters--about ten thousand--which were to be found in Chinese\r\nliterature as then existing, written in what is now known as the Lesser\r\nSeal style. It is the oldest Chinese dictionary of which we have any\r\nrecord, and has hitherto formed the basis of all etymological research.\r\nIt is arranged under 540 radicals or classifiers, that is to say,\r\nspecially selected portions of characters which indicate to some extent\r\nthe direction in which lies the sense of the whole character, and its\r\nchief object was to exhibit the pictorial features of Chinese writing.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[10] Variant “firm,” _i.e._ was firmly laid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nBUDDHISM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe introduction of Buddhism into China must now be considered,\r\nespecially under its literary aspect.\r\n\r\nSo early as B.C. 217 we read of Buddhist priests, Shih-li-fang and\r\nothers, coming to China. The “First Emperor” seems to have looked upon\r\nthem with suspicion. At any rate, he threw them into prison, from\r\nwhich, we are told, they were released in the night by a golden man\r\nor angel. Nothing more was heard of Buddhism until the Emperor known\r\nas Ming Ti, in consequence, it is said, of a dream in which a foreign\r\ngod appeared to him, sent off a mission to India to see what could be\r\nlearnt upon the subject of this barbarian religion. The mission, which\r\nconsisted of eighteen persons, returned about A.D. 67, accompanied by\r\ntwo Indian Buddhists named Kashiapmadanga and Gobharana. These two\r\nsettled at Lo-yang in Honan, which was then the capital, and proceeded\r\nto translate into Chinese the Sûtra of Forty-two Sections--the\r\nbeginning of a long line of such. Soon afterwards the former died, but\r\nthe seed had been sown, and a great rival to Taoism was about to appear\r\non the scene.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the second century A.D. another Indian\r\nBuddhist, who had come to reside at Ch‘ang-an in Shensi, translated\r\nthe _sûtra_ known as the Lotus of the Good Law, and Buddhist temples\r\nwere built in various parts of China. By the beginning of the fourth\r\ncentury Chinese novices were taking the vows required for the Buddhist\r\npriesthood, and monasteries were endowed for their reception.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FA HSIEN]\r\n\r\nIn A.D. 399 FA HSIEN started on his great pedestrian journey from the\r\nheart of China overland to India, his object being to procure copies\r\nof the Buddhist Canon, statues, and relics. Those who accompanied him\r\nat starting either turned back or died on the way, and he finally\r\nreached India with only one companion, who settled there and never\r\nreturned to China. After visiting various important centres, such as\r\nMagadha, Patna, Benares, and Buddha-Gaya, and effecting the object of\r\nhis journey, he took passage on a merchant-ship, and reached Ceylon.\r\nThere he found a large junk which carried him to Java, whence, after\r\nsurviving many perils of the sea, he made his way on board another\r\njunk to the coast of Shantung, disembarking in A.D. 414 with all\r\nhis treasures at the point now occupied by the German settlement of\r\nKiao-chow.\r\n\r\nThe narrative of his adventurous journey, as told by himself, is still\r\nin existence, written in a crabbed and difficult style. His itinerary\r\nhas been traced, and nearly all the places mentioned by him have been\r\nidentified. The following passage refers to the desert of Gobi, which\r\nthe travellers had to cross:--\r\n\r\n“In this desert there are a great many evil spirits and hot winds.\r\nThose who encounter the latter perish to a man. There are neither birds\r\nabove nor beasts below. Gazing on all sides, as far as the eye can\r\nreach, in order to mark the track, it would be impossible to succeed\r\nbut for the rotting bones of dead men which point the way.”\r\n\r\nBuddha-Gaya, the scene of recent interesting explorations conducted by\r\nthe late General Cunningham, was visited by Fa Hsien, and is described\r\nby him as follows:--\r\n\r\n“The pilgrims now arrived at the city of Gaya, also a complete waste\r\nwithin its walls. Journeying about three more miles southwards, they\r\nreached the place where the Bôdhisatva formerly passed six years in\r\nself-mortification. It is very woody. From this point going west a\r\nmile, they arrived at the spot where Buddha entered the water to bathe,\r\nand a god pressed down the branch of a tree to pull him out of the\r\npool. Also, by going two-thirds of a mile farther north, they reached\r\nthe place where the two lay-sisters presented Buddha with congee made\r\nwith milk. Two-thirds of a mile to the north of this is the place where\r\nBuddha, sitting on a stone under a great tree and facing the east, ate\r\nit. The tree and the stone are both there still, the latter being about\r\nsix feet in length and breadth by over two feet in height. In Central\r\nIndia the climate is equable; trees will live several thousand, and\r\neven so much as ten thousand years. From this point going north-east\r\nhalf a yojana, the pilgrims arrived at the cave where the Bôdhisatva,\r\nhaving entered, sat down cross-legged with his face to the west, and\r\nreflected as follows: ‘If I attain perfect wisdom, there should be\r\nsome miracle in token thereof.’ Whereupon the silhouette of Buddha\r\nappeared upon the stone, over three feet in length, and is plainly\r\nvisible to this day. Then heaven and earth quaked mightily, and the\r\ngods who were in space cried out, saying, ‘This is not the place\r\nwhere past and future Buddhas have attained and should attain perfect\r\nwisdom. The proper spot is beneath the Bô tree, less than half a yojana\r\nto the south-west of this.’ When the gods had uttered these words,\r\nthey proceeded to lead the way with singing in order to conduct him\r\nthither. The Bôdhisatva got up and followed, and when thirty paces from\r\nthe tree a god gave him the _kus’a_ grass. Having accepted this, he\r\nwent on fifteen paces farther, when five hundred dark-coloured birds\r\ncame and flew three times round him, and departed. The Bôdhisatva went\r\non to the Bô tree, and laying down his _kus’a_ grass, sat down with\r\nhis face to the east. Then Mara, the king of the devils, sent three\r\nbeautiful women to approach from the north and tempt him; he himself\r\napproaching from the south with the same object. The Bôdhisatva pressed\r\nthe ground with his toes, whereupon the infernal army retreated in\r\nconfusion, and the three women became old. At the above-mentioned place\r\nwhere Buddha suffered mortification for six years, and on all these\r\nother spots, men of after ages have built pagodas and set up images,\r\nall of which are still in existence. Where Buddha, having attained\r\nperfect wisdom, contemplated the tree for seven days, experiencing the\r\njoys of emancipation; where Buddha walked backwards and forwards, east\r\nand west, under the Bô tree for seven days; where the gods produced\r\na jewelled chamber and worshipped Buddha for seven days; where the\r\nblind dragon Muchilinda enveloped Buddha for seven days; where Buddha\r\nsat facing the east on a square stone beneath the nyagrodha tree, and\r\nBrahmâ came to salute him; where the four heavenly kings offered their\r\nalms-bowls; where the five hundred traders gave him cooked rice and\r\nhoney; where he converted the brothers Kasyapa with their disciples to\r\nthe number of one thousand souls--on all these spots stûpas have been\r\nraised.”\r\n\r\nThe following passage refers to Ceylon, called by Fa Hsien the Land\r\nof the Lion, that is, Singhala, from the name of a trader who first\r\nfounded a kingdom there:--\r\n\r\n“This country had originally no inhabitants; only devils and spirits\r\nand dragons lived in it, with whom the merchants of neighbouring\r\ncountries came to trade. When the exchange of commodities took place,\r\nthe devils and spirits did not appear in person, but set out their\r\nvaluables with the prices attached. Then the merchants, according\r\nto the prices, bought the things and carried them off. But from the\r\nmerchants going backwards and forwards and stopping on their way,\r\nthe attractions of the place became known to the inhabitants of the\r\nneighbouring countries, who also went there, and thus it became a great\r\nnation. The temperature is very agreeable in this country; there is\r\nno distinction of summer and winter. The trees and plants are always\r\ngreen, and cultivation of the soil is carried on as men please, without\r\nregard to seasons.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: KUMARAJIVA--HSÜAN TSANG]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Indian Kumarajiva, one of the Four Suns of Buddhism, had\r\nbeen occupied between A.D. 405 and 412 in dictating Chinese\r\ncommentaries on the Buddhist Canon to some eight hundred priests. He\r\nalso wrote a _shâstra_ on Reality and Appearance, and translated the\r\nDiamond Sûtra, which has done more to popularise Buddhism with the\r\neducated classes than all the material parts of this religion put\r\ntogether. Chinese poets and philosophers have drawn inspiration and\r\ninstruction from its pages, and the work might now almost be classed as\r\na national classic. Here are two short extracts:--\r\n\r\n(1.) “Buddha said, O Subhūti, tell me after thy wit, can a man see the\r\nBuddha in the flesh?\r\n\r\n“He cannot, O World-Honoured, and for this reason: The Buddha has\r\ndeclared that flesh has no objective existence.\r\n\r\n“Then Buddha told Subhūti, saying, All objective existences are\r\nunsubstantial and unreal. If a man can see clearly that they are so,\r\nthen can he see the Buddha.”\r\n\r\n(2.) “Buddha said, O Subhūti, if one man were to collect the seven\r\nprecious things from countless galaxies of worlds, and bestow all these\r\nin charity, and another virtuous man, or virtuous woman, were to become\r\nfilled with the spirit, and held fast by this _sûtra_, preaching it\r\never so little for the conversion of mankind, I say unto you that the\r\nhappiness of this last man would far exceed the happiness of that other\r\nman.\r\n\r\n“Conversion to what? To the disregard of objective existences, and to\r\nabsolute quiescence of the individual. And why? Because every external\r\nphenomenon is like a dream, like a vision, like a bubble, like shadow,\r\nlike dew, like lightning, and should be regarded as such.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn A.D. 520 Bôdhidharma came to China, and was received with\r\nhonour. He had been the son of a king in Southern India. He taught that\r\nreligion was not to be learnt from books, but that man should seek and\r\nfind the Buddha in his own heart. Just before his arrival Sung Yün had\r\nbeen sent to India to obtain more Buddhist books, and had remained two\r\nyears in Kandahar, returning with 175 volumes.\r\n\r\nThen, in 629, HSÜAN TSANG set out for India with the same object,\r\nand also to visit the holy places of Buddhism. He came back in 645,\r\nbringing with him 657 Buddhist books, besides many images and pictures\r\nand 150 relics. He spent the rest of his life translating these books,\r\nand also, like Fa Hsien, wrote a narrative of his travels.\r\n\r\nThis brings us down to the beginning of the T‘ang dynasty, when\r\nBuddhism had acquired, in spite of much opposition and even\r\npersecution, what has since proved to be a lasting hold upon the masses\r\nof the Chinese people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE THIRD\r\n\r\n_MINOR DYNASTIES_ (A.D. 200-600)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nPOETRY--MISCELLANEOUS LITERATURE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe centuries which elapsed between A.D. 200 and 600 were not\r\nfavourable to the development and growth of a national literature.\r\nDuring a great part of the time the empire was torn by civil wars;\r\nthere was not much leisure for book-learning, and few patrons to\r\nencourage it. Still the work was carried on, and many great names have\r\ncome down to us.\r\n\r\nThe dark years between A.D. 196 and 221, which witnessed the\r\ndownfall of the House of Han, were illumined by the names of seven\r\nwriters, now jointly known as the Seven Scholars of the Chien-An\r\nperiod. They were all poets. There was HSÜ KAN, who fell under\r\nthe influence of Buddhism and translated into Chinese the _Pranyamûla\r\nshâstra tikâ_ of Nâgârdjuna. The following lines are by him:--\r\n\r\n  “_O floating clouds that swim in heaven above,\r\n  Bear on your wings these words to him I love...\r\n  Alas! you float along nor heed my pain,\r\n  And leave me here to love and long in vain!\r\n  I see other dear ones to their homes return,\r\n  And for his coming shall not I too yearn?\r\n  Since my lord left--ah me, unhappy day!--\r\n  My mirror’s dust has not been brushed away;\r\n  My heart, like running water, knows no peace.\r\n  But bleeds and bleeds forever without cease._”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: K‘UNG JUNG--WANG TS’AN]\r\n\r\nThere was K‘UNG JUNG, a descendant of Confucius in the twentieth\r\ndegree, and a most precocious child. At ten years of age he went with\r\nhis father to Lo-yang, where Li Ying, the Dragon statesman, was at the\r\nheight of his political reputation. Unable from the press of visitors\r\nto gain admission, he told the doorkeeper to inform Li Ying that he\r\nwas a connection, and thus succeeded in getting in. When Li Ying asked\r\nhim what the connection was, he replied, “My ancestor Confucius and\r\nyour ancestor Lao Tzŭ were friends engaged in the quest for truth,\r\nso that you and I may be said to be of the same family.” Li Ying was\r\nastonished, but Ch‘ên Wei said, “Cleverness in youth does not mean\r\nbrilliancy in later life,” upon which K‘ung Jung remarked, “You, sir,\r\nmust evidently have been very clever as a boy.” Entering official life,\r\nhe rose to be Governor of Po-hai in Shantung; but he incurred the\r\ndispleasure of the great Ts‘ao Ts‘ao, and was put to death with all his\r\nfamily. He was an open-hearted man, and fond of good company. “If my\r\nhalls are full of guests,” he would say, “and my bottles full of wine,\r\nI am happy.”\r\n\r\nThe following is a specimen of his poetry:--\r\n\r\n  “_The wanderer reaches home with joy\r\n    From absence of a year and more:\r\n  His eye seeks a beloved boy--\r\n    His wife lies weeping on the floor._\r\n\r\n  “_They whisper he is gone. The glooms\r\n    Of evening fall; beyond the gate\r\n  A lonely grave in outline looms\r\n    To greet the sire who came too late._\r\n\r\n  “_Forth to the little mound he flings,\r\n    Where wild-flowers bloom on every side....\r\n  His bones are in the Yellow Springs,\r\n    His flesh like dust is scattered wide._\r\n\r\n  “‘_O child, who never knew thy sire,\r\n      For ever now to be unknown,\r\n  Ere long thy wandering ghost shall tire\r\n     Of flitting friendless and alone._\r\n\r\n  “‘_O son, man’s greatest earthly boon,\r\n    With thee I bury hopes and fears.’\r\n  He bowed his head in grief, and soon\r\n    His breast was wet with rolling tears._\r\n\r\n  “_Life’s dread uncertainty he knows,\r\n    But oh for this untimely close!_”\r\n\r\nThere was WANG TS’AN (A.D. 177-217), a learned man who wrote an _Ars\r\nPoetica_, not, however, in verse. A youth of great promise, he excelled\r\nas a poet, although the times were most unfavourable to success. It\r\nhas been alleged, with more or less truth, that all Chinese poetry is\r\npitched in the key of melancholy; that the favourite themes of Chinese\r\npoets are the transitory character of life with its partings and other\r\nills, and the inevitable approach of death, with substitution of the\r\nunknown for the known. Wang Ts‘an had good cause for his lamentations.\r\nHe was forced by political disturbances to leave his home at the\r\ncapital and seek safety in flight. There, as he tells us,\r\n\r\n  “_Wolves and tigers work their own sweet will._”\r\n\r\nOn the way he finds\r\n\r\n  “_Naught but bleached bones covering the plain ahead,_”\r\n\r\nand he comes across a famine-stricken woman who had thrown among the\r\nbushes a child she was unable to feed. Arriving at the Great River, the\r\nsetting sun brings his feelings to a head:--\r\n\r\n  “_Streaks of light still cling to the hill-tops,\r\n  While a deeper shade falls upon the steep slopes;\r\n  The fox makes his way to his burrow,\r\n  Birds fly back to their homes in the wood,\r\n  Clear sound the ripples of the rushing waves,\r\n  Along the banks the gibbons scream and cry,\r\n  My sleeves are fluttered by the whistling gale,\r\n  The lapels of my robe are drenched with dew.\r\n  The livelong night I cannot close my eyes.\r\n  I arise and seize my guitar,\r\n  Which, ever in sympathy with man’s changing moods,\r\n  Now sounds responsive to my grief._”\r\n\r\nBut music cannot make him forget his kith and kin--\r\n\r\n  “_Most of them, alas! are prisoners,\r\n  And weeping will be my portion to the end.\r\n  With all the joyous spots in the empire,\r\n  Why must I remain in this place?\r\n  Ah, like the grub in smartweed, I am growing insensible to\r\n      bitterness._”\r\n\r\nBy the last line he means to hint “how much a long communion tends to\r\nmake us what we are.”\r\n\r\nThere was YING YANG, who, when his own political career was\r\ncut short, wrote a poem with a title which may be interpreted as\r\n“Regret that a Bucephalus should stand idle.”\r\n\r\nThere was LIU CHÊNG, who was put to death for daring to cast an eye\r\nupon one of the favourites of the great general Ts‘ao Ts‘ao, virtual\r\nfounder of the House of Wei. CH’ÊN LIN and YÜAN YÜ complete the tale.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TS’AO TS’AO]\r\n\r\nTo these seven names an eighth and a ninth are added by courtesy:\r\nthose of TS’AO TS’AO above mentioned, and of his third son,\r\nTs‘ao Chih, the poet. The former played a remarkable part in Chinese\r\nhistory. His father had been adopted as son by the chief eunuch of the\r\npalace, and he himself was a wild young man much given to coursing and\r\nhawking. He managed, however, to graduate at the age of twenty, and,\r\nafter distinguishing himself in a campaign against insurgents, raised\r\na volunteer force to purge the country of various powerful chieftains\r\nwho threatened the integrity of the empire. By degrees the supreme\r\npower passed into his hands, and he caused the weak Emperor to raise\r\nhis daughter to the rank of Empress. He is popularly regarded as the\r\ntype of a bold bad Minister and of a cunning unscrupulous rebel. His\r\nlarge armies are proverbial, and at one time he is said to have had so\r\nmany as a million of men under arms. As an instance of the discipline\r\nwhich prevailed in his camp, it is said that he once condemned himself\r\nto death for having allowed his horse to shy into a field of grain,\r\nin accordance with his own severe regulations against any injury to\r\nstanding crops. However, in lieu of losing his head, he was persuaded\r\nto satisfy his sense of justice by cutting off his hair. The following\r\nlines are from a song by him, written in an abrupt metre of four words\r\nto the line:--\r\n\r\n  “_Here is wine, let us sing;\r\n  For man’s life is short,\r\n  Like the morning dew,\r\n  Its best days gone by.\r\n  But though we would rejoice,\r\n  Sorrows are hard to forget,\r\n  What will make us forget them?\r\n  Wine, and only wine._”\r\n\r\nAfter Ts‘ao Ts‘ao’s death came the epoch of the Three Kingdoms, the\r\nromantic story of which is told in the famous novel to be mentioned\r\nlater on. Ts‘ao Ts‘ao’s eldest son became the first Emperor of one of\r\nthese, the Wei Kingdom, and TS’AO CHIH, the poet, occupied an\r\nawkward position at court, an object of suspicion and dislike. At ten\r\nyears of age he already excelled in composition, so much so that his\r\nfather thought he must be a plagiarist; but he settled the question\r\nby producing off-hand poems on any given theme. “If all the talent of\r\nthe world,” said a contemporary poet, “were represented by ten, Ts‘ao\r\nChih would have eight, I should have one, and the rest of mankind one\r\nbetween them.” There is a story that on one occasion, at the bidding\r\nof his elder brother, probably with mischievous intent, he composed an\r\nimpromptu stanza while walking only seven steps. It has been remembered\r\nmore for its point than its poetry:--\r\n\r\n  “_A fine dish of beans had been placed in the pot\r\n  With a view to a good mess of pottage all hot.\r\n  The beanstalks, aflame, a fierce heat were begetting,\r\n  The beans in the pot were all fuming and fretting.\r\n  Yet the beans and the stalks were not born to be foes;\r\n  Oh, why should these hurry to finish off those?_”\r\n\r\nThe following extract from a poem of his contains a very well-known\r\nmaxim, constantly in use at the present day:--\r\n\r\n  “_The superior man takes precautions,\r\n  And avoids giving cause for suspicion.\r\n  He will not pull up his shoes in a melon-field,\r\n  Nor under a plum-tree straighten his hat.\r\n  Brothers- and sisters-in-law may not join hands,\r\n  Elders and youngers may not walk abreast;\r\n  By toil and humility the handle is grasped;\r\n  Moderate your brilliancy, and difficulties disappear._”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LIU LING]\r\n\r\nDuring the third century A.D. another and more mercurial set\r\nof poets, also seven in number, formed themselves into a club, and\r\nbecame widely famous as the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove. Among\r\nthese was LIU LING, a hard drinker, who declared that to a\r\ndrunken man “the affairs of this world appear but as so much duckweed\r\non a river.” He wished to be always accompanied by a servant with wine,\r\nfollowed by another with a spade, so that he might be buried where\r\nhe fell. On one occasion, yielding to the entreaties of his wife, he\r\npromised to “swear off,” and bade her prepare the usual sacrifices of\r\nwine and meat. When all was ready, he prayed, saying, “O God, who didst\r\ngive to Liu Ling a reputation through wine, he being able to consume a\r\ngallon at a sitting and requiring a quart to sober him again, listen\r\nnot to the words of his wife, for she speaketh not truth.” Thereupon\r\nhe drank up the sacrificial wine, and was soon as drunk as ever. His\r\nbias was towards the Tao of Lao Tzŭ, and he was actually plucked for\r\nhis degree in consequence of an essay extolling the heterodox doctrine\r\nof Inaction. The following skit exhibits this Taoist strain to a marked\r\ndegree:--\r\n\r\n“An old gentleman, a friend of mine (that is, himself), regards\r\neternity as but a single day, and whole centuries as but an instant\r\nof time. The sun and moon are the windows of his house; the cardinal\r\npoints are the boundaries of his domain. He wanders unrestrained and\r\nfree; he dwells within no walls. The canopy of heaven is his roof; his\r\nresting-place is the lap of earth. He follows his fancy in all things.\r\nHe is never for a moment without a wine-flask in one hand, a goblet in\r\nthe other. His only thought is wine: he knows of naught beyond.\r\n\r\n“Two respectable philanthropists, hearing of my friend’s weakness,\r\nproceeded to tax him on the subject; and with many gestures of\r\ndisapprobation, fierce scowls, and gnashing of teeth, preached him\r\nquite a sermon on the rules of propriety, and sent his faults buzzing\r\nround his head like a swarm of bees.\r\n\r\n“When they began, the old gentleman filled himself another bumper;\r\nand sitting down, quietly stroked his beard and sipped his wine by\r\nturns, until at length he lapsed into a semi-inebriate state of placid\r\nenjoyment, varied by intervals of absolute unconsciousness or of\r\npartial return to mental lucidity. His ears were beyond the reach of\r\nthunder; he could not have seen a mountain. Heat and cold existed for\r\nhim no more. He knew not even the workings of his own mind. To him,\r\nthe affairs of this world appeared but as so much duckweed on a river;\r\nwhile the two philanthropists at his side looked like two wasps trying\r\nto convert a caterpillar” (into a wasp, as the Chinese believe is done).\r\n\r\nAnother was HSI K‘ANG, a handsome young man, seven feet seven\r\ninches in height, who was married--a doubtful boon--into the Imperial\r\nfamily. His favourite study was alchemistic research, and he passed his\r\ndays sitting under a willow-tree in his courtyard and experimenting\r\nin the transmutation of metals, varying his toil with music and\r\npoetry, and practising the art of breathing with a view to securing\r\nimmortality. Happening, however, to offend by his want of ceremony\r\none of the Imperial princes, who was also a student of alchemy, he\r\nwas denounced to the Emperor as a dangerous person and a traitor, and\r\ncondemned to death. Three thousand disciples offered each one to take\r\nthe place of their beloved master, but their request was not granted.\r\nHe met his fate with fortitude, calmly watching the shadows thrown by\r\nthe sun and playing upon his lute.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HSIANG HSIU--YÜAN CHI]\r\n\r\nThe third was HSIANG HSIU, who also tried his hand at alchemy,\r\nand whose commentary on Chuang Tzŭ was stolen, as has been already\r\nstated, by Kuo Hsiang.\r\n\r\nThe fourth was YÜAN HSIEN, a wild harum-scarum fellow, but a\r\nperformer on the guitar and a great authority on the theory of music.\r\nHe and his uncle, both poverty-stricken, lived on one side of the road,\r\nwhile a wealthier branch of the family lived on the other side. On the\r\nseventh of the seventh moon the latter put out all their grand fur\r\nrobes and fine clothes to air, as is customary on that day; whereupon\r\nYüan Hsien on his side forked up a pair of the short breeches, called\r\ncalf-nose drawers, worn by the common coolies, explaining to a friend\r\nthat he was a victim to the tyranny of custom.\r\n\r\nThe fifth was YÜAN CHI, another musician, whose harpsichords became\r\nthe “Strads” of China. He entered the army and rose to a high command,\r\nand then exchanged his post for one where he had heard there was a\r\nbetter cook. He was a model of filial piety, and when his mother died\r\nhe wept so violently that he brought up several pints of blood. Yet\r\nwhen Chi Hsi went to condole with him, he showed only the whites of\r\nhis eyes (that is, paid no attention to him); while Chi Hsi’s brother,\r\nwho carried along with him a jar of wine and a guitar, was welcomed\r\nwith the pupils. His best-known work is a political and allegorical\r\npoem in thirty-eight stanzas averaging about twelve lines to each. The\r\nallusions in this are so skilfully veiled as to be quite unrecognisable\r\nwithout a commentary, such concealment being absolutely necessary for\r\nthe protection of the author in the troublous times during which he\r\nwrote.\r\n\r\nThe sixth was WANG JUNG, who could look at the sun without\r\nbeing dazzled, and lastly there was SHAN T‘AO, a follower of\r\nTaoist teachings, who was spoken of as “uncut jade” and as “gold ore.”\r\n\r\nLater on, in the fourth century, comes FU MI, of whom nothing\r\nis known beyond his verses, of which the following is a specimen:--\r\n\r\n  “_Thy chariot and horses\r\n                  have gone, and I fret\r\n  And long for the lover\r\n                  I ne’er can forget._\r\n\r\n  _O wanderer, bound\r\n                  in far countries to dwell,\r\n  Would I were thy shadow!--\r\n                  I’d follow thee well;_\r\n\r\n  _And though clouds and though darkness\r\n                  my presence should hide,\r\n  In the bright light of day\r\n                  I would stand by thy side!_”\r\n\r\nWe now reach a name which is still familiar to all students of poetry\r\nin the Middle Kingdom. T‘AO CH’IEN (A.D. 365-427), or T‘ao Yüan-ming\r\nas he was called in early life, after a youth of poverty obtained an\r\nappointment as magistrate. But he was unfitted by nature for official\r\nlife; all he wanted, to quote his own prayer, was “length of years and\r\ndepth of wine.” He only held the post for eighty-three days, objecting\r\nto receive a superior officer with the usual ceremonial on the ground\r\nthat “he could not crook the hinges of his back for five pecks of rice\r\na day,” such being the regulation pay of a magistrate. He then retired\r\ninto private life and occupied himself with poetry, music, and the\r\nculture of flowers, especially chrysanthemums, which are inseparably\r\nassociated with his name. In the latter pursuit he was seconded by his\r\nwife, who worked in the back garden while he worked in the front. His\r\nretirement from office is the subject of the following piece, of the\r\npoetical-prose class, which, in point of style, is considered one of\r\nthe masterpieces of the language:--\r\n\r\n“Homewards I bend my steps. My fields, my gardens, are choked with\r\nweeds: should I not go? My soul has led a bondsman’s life: why should I\r\nremain to pine? But I will waste no grief upon the past; I will devote\r\nmy energies to the future. I have not wandered far astray. I feel that\r\nI am on the right track once again.\r\n\r\n“Lightly, lightly, speeds my boat along, my garments fluttering to the\r\ngentle breeze. I inquire my route as I go. I grudge the slowness of the\r\ndawning day. From afar I descry my old home, and joyfully press onwards\r\nin my haste. The servants rush forth to meet me; my children cluster\r\nat the gate. The place is a wilderness; but there is the old pine-tree\r\nand my chrysanthemums. I take the little ones by the hand, and pass in.\r\nWine is brought in full jars, and I pour out in brimming cups. I gaze\r\nout at my favourite branches. I loll against the window in my new-found\r\nfreedom. I look at the sweet children on my knee.\r\n\r\n“And now I take my pleasure in my garden. There is a gate, but it is\r\nrarely opened. I lean on my staff as I wander about or sit down to\r\nrest. I raise my head and contemplate the lovely scene. Clouds rise,\r\nunwilling, from the bottom of the hills; the weary bird seeks its nest\r\nagain. Shadows vanish, but still I linger around my lonely pine. Home\r\nonce more! I’ll have no friendships to distract me hence. The times are\r\nout of joint for me; and what have I to seek from men? In the pure\r\nenjoyment of the family circle I will pass my days, cheering my idle\r\nhours with lute and book. My husbandmen will tell me when spring-time\r\nis nigh, and when there will be work in the furrowed fields. Thither\r\nI shall repair by cart or by boat, through the deep gorge, over the\r\ndizzy cliff, trees bursting merrily into leaf, the streamlet swelling\r\nfrom its tiny source. Glad is this renewal of life in due season; but\r\nfor me, I rejoice that my journey is over. Ah, how short a time it\r\nis that we are here! Why then not set our hearts at rest, ceasing to\r\ntrouble whether we remain or go? What boots it to wear out the soul\r\nwith anxious thoughts? I want not wealth; I want not power; heaven is\r\nbeyond my hopes. Then let me stroll through the bright hours as they\r\npass, in my garden among my flowers; or I will mount the hill and sing\r\nmy song, or weave my verse beside the limpid brook. Thus will I work\r\nout my allotted span, content with the appointments of Fate, my spirit\r\nfree from care.”\r\n\r\nThe “Peach-blossom Fountain” of Tao Ch‘ien is a well-known and charming\r\nallegory, a form of literature much cultivated by Chinese writers.\r\nIt tells how a fisherman lost his way among the creeks of a river,\r\nand came upon a dense and lovely grove of peach-trees in full bloom,\r\nthrough which he pushed his boat, anxious to see how far the grove\r\nextended.\r\n\r\n“He found that the peach-trees ended where the water began, at the\r\nfoot of a hill; and there he espied what seemed to be a cave with\r\nlight issuing from it. So he made fast his boat, and crept in through\r\na narrow entrance, which shortly ushered him into a new world of\r\nlevel country, of fine houses, of rich fields, of fine pools, and of\r\nluxuriance of mulberry and bamboo. Highways of traffic ran north and\r\nsouth; sounds of crowing cocks and barking dogs were heard around; the\r\ndress of the people who passed along or were at work in the fields was\r\nof a strange cut; while young and old alike appeared to be contented\r\nand happy.”\r\n\r\nHe is told that the ancestors of these people had taken refuge there\r\nsome five centuries before to escape the troublous days of the “First\r\nEmperor,” and that there they had remained, cut off completely from\r\nthe rest of the human race. On his returning home the story is noised\r\nabroad, and the Governor sends out men to find this strange region, but\r\nthe fisherman is never able to find it again. The gods had permitted\r\nthe poet to go back for a brief span to the peach-blossom days of his\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\nOne critic speaks of T‘ao Ch‘ien as “drunk with the fumes of spring.”\r\nAnother says, “His heart was fixed upon loyalty and duty, while his\r\nbody was content with leisure and repose. His emotions were real, his\r\nscenery was real, his facts were real, and his thoughts were real. His\r\nworkmanship was so exceedingly fine as to appear natural; his adze and\r\nchisel (_labor limae_) left no traces behind.”\r\n\r\nMuch of his poetry is political, and bristles with allusions to events\r\nwhich are now forgotten, mixed up with thoughts and phrases which are\r\ngreatly admired by his countrymen. Thus, when he describes meeting\r\nwith an old friend in a far-off land, such a passage as this would be\r\nheavily scored by editor or critic with marks of commendation:--\r\n\r\n  “_Ere words be spoke, the heart is drunk;\r\n    What need to call for wine?_”\r\n\r\nThe following is one of his occasional poems:--\r\n\r\n  “_A scholar lives on yonder hill,\r\n    His clothes are rarely whole to view,\r\n  Nine times a month he eats his fill,\r\n    Once in ten years his hat is new.\r\n  A wretched lot!--and yet the while\r\n  He ever wears a sunny smile._\r\n\r\n  _Longing to know what like was he,\r\n    At dawn my steps a path unclosed\r\n  Where dark firs left the passage free\r\n    And on the eaves the white clouds dozed._\r\n\r\n  _But he, as spying my intent,\r\n    Seized his guitar and swept the strings;\r\n  Up flew a crane towards heaven bent,\r\n    And now a startled pheasant springs....\r\n  Oh, let me rest with thee until\r\n  The winter winds again blow chill!_”\r\n\r\nPAO CHAO was an official and a poet who perished, A.D. 466, in a\r\nrebellion. Some of his poetry has been preserved:--\r\n\r\n  “_What do these halls of jasper mean,\r\n                    and shining floor,\r\n  Where tapestries of satin screen\r\n                    window and door?\r\n  A lady on a lonely seat,\r\n                    embroidering\r\n  Fair flowers which seem to smell as sweet\r\n                    as buds in spring.\r\n  Swallows flit past, a zephyr shakes\r\n                    the plum-blooms down;\r\n  She draws the blind, a goblet takes\r\n                    her thoughts to drown.\r\n  And now she sits in tears, or hums,\r\n                    nursing her grief\r\n  That in her life joy rarely comes\r\n                    to bring relief...\r\n  Oh, for the humble turtle’s flight,\r\n                    my mate and I;\r\n  Not the lone crane far out of sight\r\n                    beyond the sky!_”\r\n\r\nThe original name of a striking character who, in A.D. 502,\r\nplaced himself upon the throne as first Emperor of the Liang dynasty,\r\nwas HSIAO YEN. He was a devout Buddhist, living upon priestly\r\nfare and taking only one meal a day; and on two occasions, in 527 and\r\n529, he actually adopted the priestly garb. He also wrote a Buddhist\r\nritual in ten books. Interpreting the Buddhist commandment “Thou shalt\r\nnot kill” in its strictest sense, he caused the sacrificial victims to\r\nbe made of dough. The following short poem is from his pen:--\r\n\r\n  “_Trees grow, not alike,\r\n              by the mound and the moat;\r\n  Birds sing in the forest\r\n              with varying note;\r\n  Of the fish in the river\r\n              some dive and some float.\r\n  The mountains rise high\r\n              and the waters sink low,\r\n  But the why and the wherefore\r\n              we never can know._”\r\n\r\nAnother well-known poet who lived into the seventh century is HSIEH\r\nTAO-HÊNG. He offended Yang Ti, the second Emperor of the Sui\r\ndynasty, by writing better verses than his Majesty, and an excuse was\r\nfound for putting him to death. One of the most admired couplets in the\r\nlanguage is associated with his name though not actually by him, its\r\nauthor being unknown. To amuse a party of friends Hsieh Tao-hêng had\r\nwritten impromptu,\r\n\r\n  “_A week in the spring to the exile appears\r\n  Like an absence from home of a couple of years._”\r\n\r\nA “southerner” who was present sneered at the shallowness of the\r\nconceit, and immediately wrote down the following:--\r\n\r\n  “_If home, with the wild geese of autumn,\r\n                                  we’re going,\r\n  Our hearts will be off ere the spring flowers\r\n                                  are blowing._”\r\n\r\nAn official of the Sui dynasty was FU I (A.D. 554-639), who became\r\nHistoriographer under the first Emperor of the T‘ang dynasty. He\r\nhad a strong leaning towards Taoism, and edited the _Tao-Tê-Ching_.\r\nAt the same time he presented a memorial asking that the Buddhist\r\nreligion might be abolished; and when Hsiao Yü, a descendant of Hsiao\r\nYen (above), questioned him on the subject, he said, “You were not\r\nborn in a hollow mulberry-tree; yet you respect a religion which\r\ndoes not recognise the tie between father and son!” He urged that at\r\nany rate priests and nuns should be compelled to marry and bring up\r\nfamilies, and not escape from contributing their share to the revenue,\r\nadding that Hsiao Yü by defending their doctrines showed himself\r\nno better than they were. At this Hsiao Yü held up his hands, and\r\ndeclared that hell was made for such men as Fu I. The result was that\r\nsevere restrictions were placed for a short time upon the teachers\r\nof Buddhism. The Emperor T‘ai Tsung once got hold of a Tartar priest\r\nwho could “charm people into unconsciousness, and then charm them\r\nback to life again,” and spoke of his powers to Fu I. The latter said\r\nconfidently, “He will not be able to charm me;” and when put to the\r\ntest, the priest completely failed. He was the originator of epitaphs,\r\nand wrote his own, as follows:--\r\n\r\n  “_Fu I loved the green hills and the white clouds...\r\n              Alas! he died of drink._”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WANG CHI]\r\n\r\nWANG CHI of the sixth and seventh centuries A.D., was a wild and\r\nunconventional spirit, with a fatal fondness for wine, which caused his\r\ndismissal from office. His capacity for liquor was boundless, and he\r\nwas known as the Five-bottle Scholar. In his lucid intervals he wrote\r\nmuch beautiful prose and verse, which may still be read with pleasure.\r\nThe following is from an account of his visit to Drunk-Land, the story\r\nof which is told with all due gravity and in a style modelled upon that\r\nwhich is found in ordinary accounts of strange outlandish nations:--\r\n\r\n“This country is many thousand miles from the Middle Kingdom. It is a\r\nvast, boundless plain, without mountains or undulations of any kind.\r\nThe climate is equable, there being neither night, nor day, nor cold,\r\nnor heat. The manners and customs are everywhere the same.\r\n\r\n“There are no villages nor congregations of persons. The inhabitants\r\nare ethereal in disposition, and know neither love, hate, joy, nor\r\nanger. They inhale the breeze and sip the dew, eating none of the five\r\ncereals. Calm in repose, slow of gait, they mingle with birds, beasts,\r\nfishes, and scaly creatures, ignorant of boats, chariots, weapons, or\r\nimplements in general.\r\n\r\n“The Yellow Emperor went on a visit to the capital of Drunk-Land, and\r\nwhen he came back, he was quite out of conceit with the empire, the\r\ngovernment of which seemed to him but paltry trifling with knotted\r\ncords.\r\n\r\n“Yüan Chi, T‘ao Ch‘ien,[11] and some others, about ten in all, made a\r\ntrip together to Drunk-Land, and sank, never to rise again. They were\r\nburied where they fell, and now in the Middle Kingdom they are dubbed\r\nSpirits of Wine.\r\n\r\n“Alas, I could not bear that the pure and peaceful domain of Drunk-Land\r\nshould come to be regarded as a preserve of the ancients. So I went\r\nthere myself.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe period closes with the name of the Emperor known as Yang Ti,\r\nalready mentioned in connection with the poet Hsieh Tao-hêng. The\r\nmurderer, first of his elder brother and then of his father, he mounted\r\nthe throne in A.D. 605, and gave himself up to extravagance\r\nand debauchery. The trees in his park were supplied in winter with\r\nsilken leaves and flowers, and birds were almost exterminated to\r\nprovide a sufficient supply of down for his cushions. After reigning\r\nfor thirteen years this unlikely patron of literature fell a victim to\r\nassassination. Yet in spite of his otherwise disreputable character,\r\nYang Ti prided himself upon his literary attainments. He set one\r\nhundred scholars to work editing a collection of classical, medical,\r\nand other treatises; and it was under his reign, in A.D. 606,\r\nthat the examination for the second or “master of arts” degree was\r\ninstituted.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[11] Here the poet makes a mistake. These two were not contemporaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nCLASSICAL SCHOLARSHIP\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the domains of classical and general literature HUANG-FU MI\r\n(A.D. 215-282) occupies an honourable place. Beginning life\r\nat the ploughtail, by perseverance he became a fine scholar, and\r\nadopted literature as a profession. In spite of severe rheumatism he\r\nwas never without a book in his hand, and became so absorbed in his\r\nwork that he would forget all about meals and bedtime. He was called\r\nthe Book-Debauchee, and once when he wished to borrow works from the\r\nEmperor Wu Ti of the Chin dynasty, whose proffers of office he had\r\nrefused, his Majesty sent him back a cart-load to go on with. He\r\nproduced essays, poetry, and several important biographical works. His\r\nwork on the Spring and Autumn Annals had also considerable vogue.\r\n\r\nSUN SHU-JAN, of about the same date, distinguished himself by\r\nhis works on the Confucian Canon, and wrote on the _Erh Ya_.\r\n\r\nHSÜN HSÜ (_d._ A.D. 289) aided in drawing up a Penal Code for the\r\nnewly-established Chin dynasty, took a leading part in editing the\r\nBamboo Annals, which had just been discovered in Honan, provided a\r\npreface to the _Mu T‘ien Tzŭ Chuan_, and also wrote on music.\r\n\r\nKUO HSIANG (_d._ A.D. 312) occupied himself chiefly with the philosophy\r\nof Lao Tzŭ and with the writings of Chuang Tzŭ. It was said of him\r\nthat his conversation was like the continuous downflow of a rapid, or\r\nthe rush of water from a sluice.\r\n\r\nKUO P‘O (_d._ A.D. 324) was a scholar of great repute. Besides editing\r\nvarious important classical works, he was a brilliant exponent of the\r\ndoctrines of Taoism and the reputed founder of the art of geomancy as\r\napplied to graves, universally practised in China at the present day.\r\nHe was also learned in astronomy, divination, and natural philosophy.\r\n\r\nFAN YEH, executed for treason in A.D. 445, is chiefly famous for his\r\nhistory of the Han dynasty from about the date of the Christian era,\r\nwhen the dynasty was interrupted, as has been stated, by a usurper,\r\ndown to the final collapse two hundred years later.\r\n\r\nSHÊN YO (A.D. 441-513), another famous scholar, was the son of a\r\nGovernor of Huai-nan, whose execution in A.D. 453 caused him to go\r\nfor a time into hiding. Poor and studious, he is said to have spent\r\nthe night in repeating what he had learnt by day, as his mother,\r\nanxious on account of his health, limited his supply of oil and fuel.\r\nEntering official life, he rose to high office, from which he retired\r\nin ill-health, loaded with honours. Personally, he was remarkable for\r\nhaving two pupils to his left eye. He was a strict teetotaller, and\r\nlived most austerely. He had a library of twenty thousand volumes.\r\nHe was the author of the histories of the Chin, Liu Sung, and Ch‘i\r\ndynasties. He is said to have been the first to classify the four\r\ntones. In his autobiography he writes, “The poets of old, during the\r\npast thousand years, never hit upon this plan. I alone discovered its\r\nadvantages.” The Emperor Wu Ti of the Liang dynasty one day said to\r\nhim, “Come, tell me, what are these famous four tones?” “They are\r\nwhatever your Majesty pleases to make them,” replied Shên Yo, skilfully\r\nselecting for his answer four characters which illustrated, and in the\r\nusual order, the four tones in question.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HSIAO T‘UNG]\r\n\r\nHSIAO T‘UNG (A.D. 501-531) was the eldest son of Hsiao Yen, the\r\nfounder of the Liang dynasty, whom he predeceased. Before he was five\r\nyears old he was reported to have learned the Classics by heart, and\r\nhis later years were marked by great literary ability, notably in\r\nverse-making. Handsome and of charming manners, mild and forbearing,\r\nhe was universally loved. In 527 he nursed his mother through her\r\nlast illness, and his grief for her death impaired his naturally fine\r\nconstitution, for it was only at the earnest solicitation of his father\r\nthat he consented either to eat or drink during the period of mourning.\r\nLearned men were sure of his patronage, and his palace contained a\r\nlarge library. A lover of nature, he delighted to ramble with scholars\r\nabout his beautiful park, to which he declined to add the attraction of\r\nsinging-girls. When the price of grain rose in consequence of the war\r\nwith Wei in 526, he lived on the most frugal fare; and throughout his\r\nlife his charities were very large and kept secret, being distributed\r\nby trusty attendants who sought out all cases of distress. He even\r\nemptied his own wardrobe for the benefit of the poor, and spent large\r\nsums in burying the outcast dead. Against forced labour on public works\r\nhe vehemently protested. To his father he was most respectful, and\r\nwrote to him when he himself was almost at the last gasp, in the hope\r\nof concealing his danger. But he is remembered now not so much for his\r\nvirtues as for his initiation of a new department in literature. A\r\nyear before his death he completed the _Wên Hsüan_, the first published\r\ncollection of choice works, whole or in part, of a large number of\r\nauthors. These were classified under such heads as poetry of various\r\nkinds, essays, inscriptions, memorials, funeral orations, epitaphs, and\r\nprefaces.\r\n\r\nThe idea thus started was rapidly developed, and has been continued\r\ndown to modern times. Huge collections of works have from time to\r\ntime been reprinted in uniform editions, and many books which might\r\notherwise have perished have been preserved for grateful posterity.\r\nThe Record of the Buddhistic Kingdoms by Fa Hsien may be quoted as an\r\nexample.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE FOURTH\r\n\r\n_THE T‘ANG DYNASTY_ (A.D. 600-900)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nPOETRY\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: POETRY]\r\n\r\nThe T‘ang dynasty is usually associated in Chinese minds with much\r\nromance of love and war, with wealth, culture, and refinement, with\r\nfrivolity, extravagance, and dissipation, but most of all with\r\npoetry. China’s best efforts in this direction were chiefly produced\r\nwithin the limits of its three hundred years’ duration, and they have\r\nbeen carefully preserved as finished models for future poets of all\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\n“Poetry,” says a modern Chinese critic, “came into being with the\r\nOdes, developed with the _Li Sao_, burst forth and reached perfection\r\nunder the T‘angs. Some good work was indeed done under the Han and\r\nWei dynasties; the writers of those days seemed to have material in\r\nabundance, but language inadequate to its expression.”\r\n\r\nThe “Complete Collection of the Poetry of the T‘ang Dynasty,” published\r\nin 1707, contains 48,900 poems of all kinds, arranged in 900 books,\r\nand filling thirty good-sized volumes. Some Chinese writers divide\r\nthe dynasty into three poetical periods, called Early, Glorious, and\r\nLate; and they profess to detect in the works assigned to each the\r\ncorresponding characteristics of growth, fulness, and decay. Others\r\ninsert a Middle period between the last two, making four periods in\r\nall. For general purposes, however, it is only necessary to state,\r\nthat since the age of the Hans the meanings of words had gradually\r\ncome to be more definitely fixed, and the structural arrangement more\r\nuniform and more polished. Imagination began to come more freely into\r\nplay, and the language to flow more easily and more musically, as\r\nthough responsive to the demands of art. A Chinese poem is at best\r\na hard nut to crack, expressed as it usually is in lines of five or\r\nseven monosyllabic root-ideas, without inflection, agglutination, or\r\ngrammatical indication of any kind, the connection between which has\r\nto be inferred by the reader from the logic, from the context, and\r\nleast perhaps of all from the syntactical arrangement of the words.\r\nThen, again, the poet is hampered not only by rhyme but also by tone.\r\nFor purposes of poetry the characters in the Chinese language are all\r\nranged under two tones, as _flats_ and _sharps_, and these occupy\r\nfixed positions just as dactyls, spondees, trochees, and anapæsts in\r\nthe construction of Latin verse. As a consequence, the natural order\r\nof words is often entirely sacrificed to the exigencies of tone, thus\r\nmaking it more difficult than ever for the reader to grasp the sense.\r\nIn a stanza of the ordinary five-character length the following tonal\r\narrangement would appear:--\r\n\r\n  _Sharp  sharp  flat  flat  sharp\r\n  Flat      flat   sharp sharp flat\r\n  Flat      flat   flat  sharp sharp\r\n  Sharp     sharp  sharp flat  flat._\r\n\r\nThe effect produced by these tones is very marked and pleasing to\r\nthe ear, and often makes up for the faultiness of the rhymes, which\r\nare simply the rhymes of the Odes as heard 2500 years ago, many of\r\nthem of course being no longer rhymes at all. Thus, there is as much\r\nartificiality about a stanza of Chinese verse as there is about an\r\nAlcaic stanza in Latin. But in the hands of the most gifted this\r\nartificiality is altogether concealed by art, and the very trammels\r\nof tone and rhyme become transfigured, and seem to be necessary\r\naids and adjuncts to success. Many works have been published to\r\nguide the student in his admittedly difficult task. The first rule\r\nin one of these seems so comprehensive as to make further perusal\r\nquite unnecessary. It runs thus:--“Discard commonplace form; discard\r\ncommonplace ideas; discard commonplace phrasing; discard commonplace\r\nwords; discard commonplace rhymes.”\r\n\r\nA long poem does not appeal to the Chinese mind. There is no such thing\r\nas an epic in the language, though, of course, there are many pieces\r\nextending to several hundred lines. Brevity is indeed the soul of a\r\nChinese poem, which is valued not so much for what it says as for what\r\nit suggests. As in painting, so in poetry suggestion is the end and aim\r\nof the artist, who in each case may be styled an impressionist. The\r\nideal length is twelve lines, and this is the limit set to candidates\r\nat the great public examinations at the present day, the Chinese\r\nholding that if a poet cannot say within such compass what he has to\r\nsay it may very well be left unsaid. The eight-line poem is also a\r\nfavourite, and so, but for its extreme difficulty, is the four-line\r\nepigram, or “stop-short,” so called because of its abruptness, though,\r\nas the critics explain, “it is only the words which stop, the sense\r\ngoes on,” some train of thought having been suggested to the reader.\r\nThe latter form of verse was in use so far back as the Han dynasty, but\r\nonly reached perfection under the Tangs. Although consisting of only\r\ntwenty or twenty-eight words, according to the measure employed, it is\r\njust long enough for the poet to introduce, to develop, to embellish,\r\nand to conclude his theme in accordance with certain established laws\r\nof composition. The third line is considered the most troublesome to\r\nproduce, some poets even writing it first; the last line should contain\r\na “surprise” or _dénouement_. We are, in fact, reminded of the old\r\nformula, “Omne epigramma sit instar apis,” &c., better known in its\r\nEnglish dress:--\r\n\r\n  “_The qualities rare in a bee that we meet\r\n    In an epigram never should fail;\r\n  The body should always be little and sweet,\r\n    And a sting should be left in the tail._”\r\n\r\nThe following is an early specimen, by an anonymous writer, of the\r\nfour-line poem:--\r\n\r\n  “_The bright moon shining overhead,\r\n    The stream beneath the breeze’s touch,\r\n  Are pure and perfect joys indeed,--\r\n    But few are they who think them such._”\r\n\r\nTurning now to the almost endless list of poets from which but a scanty\r\nselection can be made, we may begin with WANG PO (A.D. 648-676), a\r\nprecocious boy who wrote verses when he was six. He took his degree\r\nat sixteen, and was employed in the Historical Department, but was\r\ndismissed for satirising the cock-fighting propensities of the Imperial\r\nprinces. He filled up his leisure by composing many beautiful poems.\r\nHe never meditated on these beforehand, but after having prepared a\r\nquantity of ink ready for use, he would drink himself tipsy and lie\r\ndown with his face covered up. On waking he would seize his pen and\r\nwrite off verses, not a word in which needed to be changed; whence\r\nhe acquired the sobriquet of Belly-Draft, meaning that his drafts,\r\nor rough copies, were all prepared inside. And he received so many\r\npresents of valuable silks for writing these odes, that it was said “he\r\nspun with his mind.” These lines are from his pen:--\r\n\r\n  “_Near these islands a palace\r\n            was built by a prince,\r\n  But its music and song\r\n            have departed long since;\r\n  The hill-mists of morning\r\n            sweep down on the halls,\r\n  At night the red curtains\r\n            lie furled on the walls.\r\n  The clouds o’er the water\r\n            their shadows still cast,\r\n  Things change like the stars:\r\n            how few autumns have passed\r\n  And yet where is that prince?\r\n            where is he?--No reply,\r\n  Save the plash of the stream\r\n            rolling ceaselessly by._”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CH’ÊN TZŬ-ANG]\r\n\r\nA still more famous contemporary of his was CH’ÊN TZŬ-ANG (A.D.\r\n656-698), who adopted somewhat sensational means of bringing himself to\r\nthe notice of the public. He purchased a very expensive guitar which\r\nhad been for a long time on sale, and then let it be known that on the\r\nfollowing day he would perform upon it in public. This attracted a\r\nlarge crowd; but when Ch‘ên arrived he informed his auditors that he\r\nhad something in his pocket worth much more than the guitar. Thereupon\r\nhe dashed the instrument into a thousand pieces, and forthwith began\r\nhanding round copies of his own writings. Here is a sample, directed\r\nagainst the Buddhist worship of idols, the “Prophet” representing any\r\ndivinely-inspired teacher of the Confucian school:--\r\n\r\n  “_On Self the Prophet never rests his eye,\r\n    His to relieve the doom of humankind;\r\n  No fairy palaces beyond the sky,\r\n    Rewards to come, are present to his mind._\r\n\r\n  _And I have heard the faith by Buddha taught\r\n    Lauded as pure and free from earthly taint;\r\n  Why then these carved and graven idols, fraught\r\n    With gold and silver, gems, and jade, and paint?_\r\n\r\n  _The heavens that roof this earth, mountain and dale,\r\n    All that is great and grand, shall pass away;\r\n  And if the art of gods may not prevail,\r\n    Shall man’s poor handiwork escape decay?_\r\n\r\n  _Fools that ye are! In this ignoble light\r\n  The true faith fades and passes out of sight._”\r\n\r\nAs an official, Ch‘ên Tzŭ-ang once gained great _kudos_ by a truly\r\nSolomonic decision. A man, having slain the murderer of his father,\r\nwas himself indicted for murder. Ch‘ên Tzŭ-ang caused him to be put to\r\ndeath, but at the same time conferred an honorific distinction upon his\r\nvillage for having produced so filial a son.\r\n\r\nNot much is known of SUNG CHIH-WÊN (_d._ A.D. 710), at any rate to his\r\ngood. On one occasion the Emperor was so delighted with some of his\r\nverses that he took off the Imperial robe and placed it on the poet’s\r\nshoulders. This is one of his poems:--\r\n\r\n  “_The dust of the morn\r\n            had been laid by a shower,\r\n  And the trees by the bridge\r\n            were all covered with flower,\r\n  When a white palfrey passed\r\n            with a saddle of gold,\r\n  And a damsel as fair\r\n            as the fairest of old._\r\n\r\n  _But she veiled so discreetly\r\n            her charms from my eyes\r\n  That the boy who was with her\r\n            quite felt for my sighs;\r\n  And although not a light-o’-love\r\n            reckoned, I deem,\r\n  It was hard that this vision\r\n            should pass like a dream._”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MÊNG HAO-JAN]\r\n\r\nMÊNG HAO-JAN (A.D. 689-740) gave no sign in his youth of the genius\r\nthat was latent within him. He failed at the public examinations, and\r\nretired to the mountains as a recluse. He then became a poet of the\r\nfirst rank, and his writings were eagerly sought after. At the age of\r\nforty he went up to the capital, and was one day conversing with his\r\nfamous contemporary, Wang Wei, when suddenly the Emperor was announced.\r\nHe hid under a couch, but Wang Wei betrayed him, the result being a\r\npleasant interview with his Majesty. The following is a specimen of his\r\nverse:--\r\n\r\n  “_The sun has set behind the western slope,\r\n    The eastern moon lies mirrored in the pool;\r\n  With streaming hair my balcony I ope,\r\n    And stretch my limbs out to enjoy the cool.\r\n  Loaded with lotus-scent the breeze sweeps by,\r\n    Clear dripping drops from tall bamboos I hear,\r\n  I gaze upon my idle lute and sigh;\r\n    Alas, no sympathetic soul is near.\r\n  And so I doze, the while before mine eyes\r\n  Dear friends of other days in dream-clad forms arise._”\r\n\r\nEqually famous as poet and physician was WANG WEI (A.D. 699-759). After\r\na short spell of official life, he too retired into seclusion and\r\noccupied himself with poetry and with the consolations of Buddhism,\r\nin which he was a firm believer. His lines on bidding adieu to Mêng\r\nHao-jan, when the latter was seeking refuge on the mountains, are as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  “_Dismounted, o’er wine\r\n                we had said our last say;\r\n  Then I whisper, ‘Dear friend,\r\n                tell me, whither away?’\r\n  ‘Alas!’ he replied,\r\n                ‘I am sick of life’s ills,\r\n  And I long for repose\r\n                on the slumbering hills.\r\n  But oh seek not to pierce\r\n                where my footsteps may stray:\r\n  The white clouds will soothe me\r\n                for ever and ay.’_”\r\n\r\nThe accompanying “stop-short” by the same writer is generally thought\r\nto contain an effective surprise in the last line:--\r\n\r\n  “_Beneath the bamboo grove, alone,\r\n    I seize my lute and sit and croon;\r\n  No ear to hear me, save mine own:\r\n    No eye to see me--save the moon._”\r\n\r\nWang Wei has been accused of loose writing and incongruous pictures. A\r\nfriendly critic defends him as follows:--“For instance, there is Wang\r\nWei, who introduces bananas into a snow-storm. When, however, we come\r\nto examine such points by the light of scholarship, we see that his\r\nmind had merely passed into subjective relationship with the things\r\ndescribed. Fools say he did not know heat from cold.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TS’UI HAO]\r\n\r\nA skilled poet, and a wine-bibber and gambler to boot, was TS’UI\r\nHAO, who graduated about A.D. 730.\r\n\r\nHe wrote a poem on the Yellow-Crane pagoda which until quite recently\r\nstood on the bank of the Yang-tsze near Hankow, and was put up to mark\r\nthe spot where Wang Tzŭ-ch‘iao, who had attained immortality, went up\r\nto heaven in broad daylight six centuries before the Christian era. The\r\ngreat Li Po once thought of writing on the theme, but he gave up the\r\nidea so soon as he had read these lines by Ts‘ui Hao:--\r\n\r\n  “_Here a mortal once sailed\r\n                up to heaven on a crane,\r\n  And the Yellow-Crane Kiosque,\r\n                will for ever remain;\r\n  But the bird flew away\r\n                and will come back no more,\r\n  Though the white clouds are there\r\n                as the white clouds of yore._\r\n\r\n  _Away to the east\r\n                lie fair forests of trees,\r\n  From the flowers on the west\r\n                comes a scent-laden breeze,\r\n  Yet my eyes daily turn\r\n                to their far-away home,\r\n  Beyond the broad River,\r\n                its waves, and its foam._”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LI PO]\r\n\r\nBy general consent LI PO himself (A.D. 705-762) would probably be\r\nnamed as China’s greatest poet. His wild Bohemian life, his gay and\r\ndissipated career at Court, his exile, and his tragic end, all combine\r\nto form a most effective setting for the splendid flow of verse which\r\nhe never ceased to pour forth. At the early age of ten he wrote a\r\n“stop-short” to a firefly:--\r\n\r\n  “_Rain cannot quench thy lantern’s light,\r\n  Wind makes it shine more brightly bright;\r\n  Oh why not fly to heaven afar,\r\n  And twinkle near the moon--a star?_”\r\n\r\nLi Po began by wandering about the country, until at length, with five\r\nother tippling poets, he retired to the mountains. For some time these\r\nSix Idlers of the Bamboo Grove drank and wrote verses to their hearts’\r\ncontent. By and by Li Po reached the capital, and on the strength of\r\nhis poetry was introduced to the Emperor as a “banished angel.” He\r\nwas received with open arms, and soon became the spoilt child of the\r\npalace. On one occasion, when the Emperor sent for him, he was found\r\nlying drunk in the street; and it was only after having his face well\r\nmopped with cold water that he was fit for the Imperial presence. His\r\ntalents, however, did not fail him. With a lady of the seraglio to hold\r\nhis ink-slab, he dashed off some of his most impassioned lines; at\r\nwhich the Emperor was so overcome that he made the powerful eunuch Kao\r\nLi-shih go down on his knees and pull off the poet’s boots. On another\r\noccasion, the Emperor, who was enjoying himself with his favourite\r\nlady in the palace grounds, called for Li Po to commemorate the scene\r\nin verse. After some delay the poet arrived, supported between two\r\neunuchs. “Please your Majesty,” he said, “I have been drinking with the\r\nPrince and he has made me drunk, but I will do my best.” Thereupon two\r\nof the ladies of the harem held up in front of him a pink silk screen,\r\nand in a very short time he had thrown off no less than ten eight-line\r\nstanzas, of which the following, describing the life of a palace\r\nfavourite, is one:--\r\n\r\n  “_Oh, the joy of youth spent\r\n                  in a gold-fretted hall,\r\n  In the Crape-flower Pavilion,\r\n                  the fairest of all,\r\n  My tresses for head-dress\r\n                  with gay garlands girt,\r\n  Carnations arranged\r\n                  o’er my jacket and skirt!\r\n  Then to wander away\r\n                  in the soft-scented air,\r\n  And return by the side\r\n                  of his Majesty’s chair ...\r\n  But the dance and the song\r\n                  will be o’er by and by,\r\n  And we shall dislimn\r\n                  like the rack in the sky._”\r\n\r\nAs time went on, Li Po fell a victim to intrigue, and left the Court in\r\ndisgrace. It was then that he wrote--\r\n\r\n  “_My whitening hair would make a long, long rope,\r\n    Yet would not fathom all my depth of woe._”\r\n\r\nAfter more wanderings and much adventure, he was drowned on a journey,\r\nfrom leaning one night too far over the edge of a boat in a drunken\r\neffort to embrace the reflection of the moon. Just previously he had\r\nindited the following lines:--\r\n\r\n  “_An arbour of flowers\r\n            and a kettle of wine:\r\n  Alas! in the bowers\r\n            no companion is mine.\r\n  Then the moon sheds her rays\r\n            on my goblet and me,\r\n  And my shadow betrays\r\n            we’re a party of three._\r\n\r\n  “_Though the moon cannot swallow\r\n            her share of the grog,\r\n  And my shadow must follow\r\n            wherever I jog,--\r\n  Yet their friendship I’ll borrow\r\n            and gaily carouse,\r\n  And laugh away sorrow\r\n            while spring-time allows._\r\n\r\n  “_See the moon,--how she glances\r\n            response to my song;\r\n  See my shadow,--it dances\r\n            so lightly along!\r\n  While sober I feel\r\n            you are both my good friends;\r\n  When drunken I reel,\r\n            our companionship ends.\r\n  But we’ll soon have a greeting\r\n            without a good-bye,\r\n  At our next merry meeting\r\n            away in the sky._”\r\n\r\nHis control of the “stop-short” is considered to be perfect:--\r\n\r\n  (1.) “_The birds have all flown to their roost in the tree,\r\n    The last cloud has just floated lazily by;\r\n  But we never tire of each other, not we,\r\n    As we sit there together,--the mountains and I._”\r\n\r\n  (2.) “_I wake, and moonbeams play around my bed,\r\n    Glittering like hoar-frost to my wondering eyes;\r\n  Up towards the glorious moon I raise my head,\r\n    Then lay me down,--and thoughts of home arise._”\r\n\r\nThe following are general extracts:--\r\n\r\nA PARTING.\r\n\r\n  (1.) “_The river rolls crystal as clear as the sky,\r\n  To blend far away with the blue waves of ocean;\r\n  Man alone, when the hour of departure is nigh,\r\n  With the wine-cup can soothe his emotion._\r\n\r\n  “_The birds of the valley sing loud in the sun,\r\n  Where the gibbons their vigils will shortly be keeping:\r\n  I thought that with tears I had long ago done,\r\n  But now I shall never cease weeping._”\r\n\r\n  (2.) “_Homeward at dusk the clanging rookery wings its eager flight;\r\n  Then, chattering on the branches, all are pairing for the night.\r\n  Plying her busy loom, a high-born dame is sitting near,\r\n  And through the silken window-screen their voices strike her ear.\r\n  She stops, and thinks of the absent spouse she may never see again;\r\n  And late in the lonely hours of night her tears flow down like rain._”\r\n\r\n  (3.) “_What is life after all but a dream?\r\n    And why should such pother be made?\r\n  Better far to be tipsy, I deem,\r\n    And doze all day long in the shade._\r\n\r\n  “_When I wake and look out on the lawn,\r\n    I hear midst the flowers a bird sing;\r\n  I ask, ‘Is it evening or dawn?’\r\n    The mango-bird whistles, ‘’Tis spring.’_\r\n\r\n  “_Overpower’d with the beautiful sight,\r\n    Another full goblet I pour,\r\n  And would sing till the moon rises bright--\r\n    But soon I’m as drunk as before._”\r\n\r\n  (4.) “_You ask what my soul does away in the sky,\r\n  I inwardly smile but I cannot reply;\r\n  Like the peach-blossoms carried away by the stream,\r\n  I soar to a world of which you cannot dream._”\r\n\r\nOne more extract may be given, chiefly to exhibit what is held by\r\nthe Chinese to be of the very essence of real poetry,--suggestion. A\r\npoet should not dot his i’s. The Chinese reader likes to do that for\r\nhimself, each according to his own fancy. Hence such a poem as the\r\nfollowing, often quoted as a model in its own particular line:--\r\n\r\n  “_A tortoise I see on a lotus-flower resting:\r\n  A bird ’mid the reeds and the rushes is nesting;\r\n  A light skiff propelled by some boatman’s fair daughter,\r\n  Whose song dies away o’er the fast-flowing water._”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TU FU]\r\n\r\nAnother poet of the same epoch, of whom his countrymen are also justly\r\nproud, is TU FU (A.D. 712-770). He failed to distinguish himself at\r\nthe public examinations, at which verse-making counts so much, but had\r\nnevertheless such a high opinion of his own poetry that he prescribed\r\nit as a cure for malarial fever. He finally obtained a post at Court,\r\nwhich he was forced to vacate in the rebellion of 755. As he himself\r\nwrote in political allegory--\r\n\r\n  “_Full with the freshets of the spring the torrent rushes on;\r\n  The ferry-boat swings idly, for the ferry-man is gone._”\r\n\r\nAfter further vain attempts to make an official career, he took to a\r\nwandering life, was nearly drowned by an inundation, and was compelled\r\nto live for ten days on roots. Being rescued, he succumbed next day\r\nto the effects of eating roast-beef and drinking white wine to excess\r\nafter so long a fast. These are some of his poems:--\r\n\r\n  (1.) “_The setting sun shines low upon my door\r\n    Ere dusk enwraps the river fringed with spring;\r\n  Sweet perfumes rise from gardens by the shore,\r\n    And smoke, where crews their boats to anchor bring._\r\n\r\n  “_Now twittering birds are roosting in the bower,\r\n    And flying insects fill the air around....\r\n  O wine, who gave to thee thy subtle power?\r\n    A thousand cares in one small goblet drowned!_”\r\n\r\n  (2.) “_A petal falls!--the spring begins to fail,\r\n  And my heart saddens with the growing gale.\r\n  Come then, ere autumn spoils bestrew the ground,\r\n  Do not forget to pass the wine-cup round.\r\n  Kingfishers build where man once laughed elate,\r\n  And now stone dragons guard his graveyard gate!\r\n  Who follows pleasure, he alone is wise;\r\n  Why waste our life in deeds of high emprise?_”\r\n\r\n  (3.) “_My home is girdled by a limpid stream,\r\n    And there in summer days life’s movements pause,\r\n  Save where some swallow flits from beam to beam,\r\n    And the wild sea-gull near and nearer draws._\r\n\r\n  “_The goodwife rules a paper board for chess;\r\n    The children beat a fish-hook out of wire;\r\n  My ailments call for physic more or less,\r\n    What else should this poor frame of mine require?_”\r\n\r\n  (4.) “_Alone I wandered o’er the hills to seek the hermit’s den,\r\n  While sounds of chopping rang around the forest’s leafy glen.\r\n  I passed on ice across the brook, which had not ceased to freeze,\r\n  As the slanting rays of afternoon shot sparkling through the trees._\r\n\r\n  “_I found he did not joy to gloat o’er fetid wealth by night,\r\n  But, far from taint, to watch the deer in the golden morning light....\r\n  My mind was clear at coming; but now I’ve lost my guide,\r\n  And rudderless my little bark is drifting with the tide!_”\r\n\r\n  (5.) “_From the Court every eve to the pawnshop I pass,\r\n    To come back from the river the drunkest of men;\r\n  As often as not I’m in debt for my glass;--\r\n    Well, few of us live to be threescore and ten._\r\n\r\n  _The butterfly flutters from flower to flower,\r\n    The dragon-fly sips and springs lightly away,\r\n  Each creature is merry its brief little hour,\r\n    So let us enjoy our short life while we may._”\r\n\r\nHere is a specimen of his skill with the “stop-short,” based upon a\r\ndisease common to all Chinese, poets or otherwise,--nostalgia:--\r\n\r\n  “_White gleam the gulls across the darkling tide,\r\n    On the green hills the red flowers seem to burn;\r\n  Alas! I see another spring has died....\r\n    When will it come--the day of my return?_”\r\n\r\nOf the poet CHANG CH’IEN not much is known. He graduated in 727, and\r\nentered upon an official career, but ultimately betook himself to the\r\nmountains and lived as a hermit. He is said to have been a devotee of\r\nTaoism. The following poem, however, which deals with _dhyâna_, or\r\nthe state of mental abstraction in which all desire for existence is\r\nshaken off, would make it seem as if his leanings had been Buddhistic.\r\nIt gives a perfect picture, so far as it goes, of the Buddhist retreat\r\noften to be found among mountain peaks all over China, visited by\r\npilgrims who perform religious exercises or fulfil vows at the feet of\r\nthe World-Honoured, and by contemplative students eager to shake off\r\nthe “red dust” of mundane affairs:--\r\n\r\n  “_The clear dawn creeps into the convent old,\r\n  The rising sun tips its tall trees with gold,\r\n  As, darkly, by a winding path I reach\r\n  Dhyâna’s hall, hidden midst fir and beech.\r\n  Around these hills sweet birds their pleasure take,\r\n  Man’s heart as free from shadows as this lake;\r\n  Here worldly sounds are hushed, as by a spell,\r\n  Save for the booming of the altar bell._”\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt of the influence of Buddhism upon the poet\r\nTS’ÊN TS’AN, who graduated about 750, as witness his lines on\r\nthat faith:--\r\n\r\n  “_A shrine whose eaves in far-off cloudland hide:\r\n  I mount, and with the sun stand side by side.\r\n  The air is clear; I see wide forests spread\r\n  And mist-crowned heights where kings of old lie dead.\r\n  Scarce o’er my threshold peeps the Southern Hill;\r\n  The Wei shrinks through my window to a rill....\r\n  O thou Pure Faith, had I but known thy scope,\r\n  The Golden God[12] had long since been my hope!_”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WANG CHIEN]\r\n\r\nWANG CHIEN took the highest degree in 775, and rose to be Governor of a\r\nDistrict. He managed, however, to offend one of the Imperial clansmen,\r\nin consequence of which his official career was abruptly cut short. He\r\nwrote a good deal of verse, and was on terms of intimacy with several\r\nof the great contemporary poets. In the following lines, the metre of\r\nwhich is irregular, he alludes to the extraordinary case of a soldier’s\r\nwife who spent all her time on a hill-top looking down the Yang-tsze,\r\nwatching for her husband’s return from the wars. At length--\r\n\r\n          “_Where her husband she sought,\r\n            By the river’s long track,\r\n          Into stone she was wrought,\r\n            And can never come back;\r\n  ’Mid the wind and the rain-storm for ever and ay,\r\n  She appeals to each home-comer passing that way._”\r\n\r\nThe last line makes the stone figure, into which the unhappy woman was\r\nchanged, appear to be asking of every fresh arrival news of the missing\r\nman. That is the skill of the artist, and is inseparably woven into the\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HAN YÜ]\r\n\r\nPassing over many poets equally well known with some of those already\r\ncited, we reach a name undoubtedly the most venerated of all those ever\r\nassociated in any way with the great mass of Chinese literature. HAN YÜ\r\n(A.D. 768-824), canonised and usually spoken of as Han Wên-kung, was\r\nnot merely a poet, but a statesman of the first rank, and philosopher\r\nto boot. He rose from among the humblest of the people to the highest\r\noffices of State. In 803 he presented a memorial protesting against\r\ncertain extravagant honours with which the Emperor Hsien Tsung proposed\r\nto receive a bone of Buddha. The monarch was furious, and but for the\r\nintercession of friends it would have fared badly with the bold writer.\r\nAs it was, he was banished to Ch‘ao-chou Fu in Kuangtung, where he\r\nset himself to civilise the rude inhabitants of those wild parts. In\r\na temple at the summit of the neighbouring range there is to be seen\r\nat this day a huge picture of the Prince of Literature, as he has been\r\ncalled by foreigners from his canonisation, with the following legend\r\nattached:--“Wherever he passed, he purified.” He is even said to have\r\ndriven away a huge crocodile which was devastating the watercourses in\r\nthe neighbourhood; and the denunciatory ultimatum which he addressed\r\nto the monster and threw into the river, together with a pig and a\r\ngoat, is still regarded as a model of Chinese composition. It was\r\nnot very long ere he was recalled to the capital and reinstated in\r\noffice; but he had been delicate all his life and had grown prematurely\r\nold, and was thus unable to resist a severe illness which came upon\r\nhim. His friend and contemporary, Liu Tsung-yüan, said that he never\r\nventured to open the works of Han Yü without first washing his hands\r\nin rose-water. His writings, especially his essays, are often of the\r\nvery highest order, leaving nothing to be desired either in originality\r\nor in style. But it is more than all for his pure and noble character,\r\nhis calm and dignified patriotism, that the Chinese still keep his\r\nmemory green. The following lines were written by Su Tung-p‘o, nearly\r\n300 years after his death, for a shrine which had just been put up in\r\nhonour of the dead teacher by the people of Ch‘ao-chou Fu:--\r\n\r\n  “_He rode on the dragon to the white cloud domain;\r\n  He grasped with his hand the glory of the sky;\r\n  Robed with the effulgence of the stars,\r\n  The wind bore him delicately to the throne of God.\r\n  He swept away the chaff and husks of his generation.\r\n  He roamed over the limits of the earth.\r\n  He clothed all nature with his bright rays,\r\n  The third in the triumvirate of genius.[13]\r\n  His rivals panted after him in vain,\r\n  Dazed by the brilliancy of the light.\r\n  He cursed Buddha; he offended his prince;\r\n  He journeyed far away to the distant south;\r\n  He passed the grave of Shun, and wept over the daughters of Yao.\r\n  The water-god went before him and stilled the waves.\r\n  He drove out the fierce monster as it were a lamb.\r\n  But above, in heaven, there was no music, and God was sad,\r\n  And summoned him to his place beside the Throne.\r\n  And now, with these poor offerings, I salute him;\r\n  With red lichees and yellow plantain fruit.\r\n  Alas! that he did not linger awhile on earth,\r\n  But passed so soon, with streaming hair, into the great unknown._”\r\n\r\nHan Yü wrote a large quantity of verse, frequently playful, on an\r\nimmense variety of subjects, and under his touch the commonplace was\r\noften transmuted into wit. Among other pieces there is one on his\r\nteeth, which seemed to drop out at regular intervals, so that he could\r\ncalculate roughly what span of life remained to him. Altogether, his\r\npoetry cannot be classed with that of the highest order, unlike his\r\nprose writings, extracts from which will be given in the next chapter.\r\nThe following poem is a specimen of his lighter vein:--\r\n\r\n  “_To stand upon the river-bank\r\n                and snare the purple fish,\r\n  My net well cast across the stream,\r\n                was all that I could wish.\r\n  Or lie concealed and shoot the geese\r\n                that scream and pass apace,\r\n  And pay my rent and taxes with\r\n                the profits of the chase.\r\n  Then home to peace and happiness,\r\n                with wife and children gay,\r\n  Though clothes be coarse and fare be hard,\r\n                and earned from day to day.\r\n  But now I read and read, scarce knowing\r\n                what ’tis all about,\r\n  And, eager to improve my mind,\r\n                I wear my body out.\r\n  I draw a snake and give it legs,\r\n                to find I’ve wasted skill,\r\n  And my hair grows daily whiter\r\n                as I hurry towards the hill.[14]\r\n  I sit amid the sorrows\r\n                I have brought on my own head,\r\n  And find myself estranged from all,\r\n                among the living dead.\r\n  I seek to drown my consciousness\r\n                in wine, alas! in vain:\r\n  Oblivion passes quickly\r\n                and my griefs begin again.\r\n  Old age comes on, and yet withholds\r\n                the summons to depart....\r\n  So I’ll take another bumper\r\n              just to ease my aching heart._”\r\n\r\n\r\nHumane treatment of the lower animals is not generally supposed to be a\r\ncharacteristic of the Chinese. They have no Society for the Prevention\r\nof Cruelty to Animals, which may perhaps account for some of their\r\nshortcomings in this direction. Han Yü was above all things of a\r\nkindly, humane nature, and although the following piece cannot be taken\r\nseriously, it affords a useful index to his general feelings:--\r\n\r\n  “_Oh, spare the busy morning fly,\r\n    Spare the mosquitos of the night!\r\n  And if their wicked trade they ply,\r\n    Let a partition stop their flight._\r\n\r\n  “_Their span is brief from birth to death;\r\n    Like you, they bite their little day;\r\n  And then, with autumn’s earliest breath,\r\n    Like you, too, they are swept away._”\r\n\r\nThe following lines were written on the way to his place of exile in\r\nKuangtung:--\r\n\r\n  “_Alas! the early season flies,\r\n    Behold the remnants of the spring!\r\n  My boat in landlocked water lies,\r\n    At dawn I hear the wild birds sing._\r\n\r\n  “_Then, through clouds lingering on the slope,\r\n    The rising sun breaks on to me,\r\n  And thrills me with a fleeting hope,--\r\n    A prisoner longing to be free._\r\n\r\n  “_My flowing tears are long since dried,\r\n    Though care clings closer than it did.\r\n  But stop! All care we lay aside\r\n    When once they close the coffin lid._”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PO CHÜ-I]\r\n\r\nAnother famous poet, worthy to be mentioned even after Han Yü,\r\nwas PO CHÜ-I (A.D. 772-846). As a child he was most precocious,\r\nknowing a considerable number of the written characters at the\r\nearly age of seven months, after having had each one pointed\r\nout only once by his nurse. He graduated at the age of seventeen, and\r\nrose to high office in the State, though at one period of his life\r\nhe was banished to a petty post, which somewhat disgusted him with\r\nofficialdom. To console himself, he built a retreat at Hsiang-shan,\r\nby which name he is sometimes called; and there, together with eight\r\ncongenial companions, he gave himself up to poetry and speculations\r\nupon a future life. To escape recognition and annoyance, all names were\r\ndropped, and the party was generally known as the Nine Old Gentlemen of\r\nHsiang-shan. This reaching the ears of the Emperor, he was transferred\r\nto be Governor of Chung-chou; and on the accession of Mu Tsung in\r\n821 he was sent as Governor to Hangchow. There he built one of the\r\ngreat embankments of the beautiful Western Lake, still known as Po’s\r\nEmbankment. He was subsequently Governor of Soochow, and finally rose\r\nin 841 to be President of the Board of War. His poems were collected\r\nby Imperial command and engraved upon tablets of stone, which were\r\nset up in a garden he had made for himself in imitation of his former\r\nbeloved retreat at Hsiang-shan. He disbelieved in the genuineness of\r\nthe _Tao-Tê-Ching_, and ridiculed its preposterous claims as follows:--\r\n\r\n  “_‘Who know, speak not; who speak, know naught,’\r\n    Are words from Lao Tzŭ’s lore.\r\n  What then becomes of Lao Tzŭ’s own\r\n    ‘Five thousand words and more’?_”\r\n\r\nHere is a charming poem from his pen, which tells the story of a poor\r\nlute-girl’s sorrows. This piece is ranked very high by the commentator\r\nLin Hsi-chung, who points out how admirably the wording is adapted to\r\necho the sense, and declares that such workmanship raises the reader\r\nto that state of mental ecstasy known to the Buddhists as _samâdhi_,\r\nand can only be produced once in a thousand autumns. The “guest” is the\r\npoet himself, setting out a second time for his place of banishment, as\r\nmentioned above, from a point about half-way thither, where he had been\r\nstruck down by illness:--\r\n\r\n“By night, at the riverside, adieus were spoken: beneath the maple’s\r\nflower-like leaves, blooming amid autumnal decay. Host had dismounted\r\nto speed the parting guest, already on board his boat. Then a\r\nstirrup-cup went round, but no flute, no guitar, was heard. And so, ere\r\nthe heart was warmed with wine, came words of cold farewell beneath the\r\nbright moon, glittering over the bosom of the broad stream ... when\r\nsuddenly across the water a lute broke forth into sound. Host forgot\r\nto go, guest lingered on, wondering whence the music, and asking who\r\nthe performer might be. At this, all was hushed, but no answer given. A\r\nboat approached, and the musician was invited to join the party. Cups\r\nwere refilled, lamps trimmed again, and preparations for festivity\r\nrenewed. At length, after much pressing, she came forth, hiding her\r\nface behind her lute; and twice or thrice sweeping the strings,\r\nbetrayed emotion ere her song was sung. Then every note she struck\r\nswelled with pathos deep and strong, as though telling the tale of a\r\nwrecked and hopeless life, while with bent head and rapid finger she\r\npoured forth her soul in melody. Now softly, now slowly, her plectrum\r\nsped to and fro; now this air, now that; loudly, with the crash of\r\nfalling rain; softly, as the murmur of whispered words; now loud and\r\nsoft together, like the patter of pearls and pearlets dropping upon\r\na marble dish. Or liquid, like the warbling of the mango-bird in the\r\nbush; trickling, like the streamlet on its downward course. And then,\r\nlike the torrent, stilled by the grip of frost, so for a moment was\r\nthe music lulled, in a passion too deep for sound. Then, as bursts the\r\nwater from the broken vase, as clash the arms upon the mailed horseman,\r\nso fell the plectrum once more upon the strings with a slash like the\r\nrent of silk.\r\n\r\n“Silence on all sides: not a sound stirred the air. The autumn moon\r\nshone silver athwart the tide, as with a sigh the musician thrust her\r\nplectrum beneath the strings and quietly prepared to take leave. ‘My\r\nchildhood,’ said she, ‘was spent at the capital, in my home near the\r\nhills. At thirteen, I learnt the guitar, and my name was enrolled\r\namong the _primas_ of the day. The _maëstro_ himself acknowledged my\r\nskill: the most beauteous of women envied my lovely face. The youths\r\nof the neighbourhood vied with each other to do me honour: a single\r\nsong brought me I know not how many costly bales. Golden ornaments and\r\nsilver pins were smashed, blood-red skirts of silk were stained with\r\nwine, in oft-times echoing applause. And so I laughed on from year to\r\nyear, while the spring breeze and autumn moon swept over my careless\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n“‘Then my brother went away to the wars: my mother died. Nights passed\r\nand mornings came; and with them my beauty began to fade. My doors were\r\nno longer thronged; but few cavaliers remained. So I took a husband\r\nand became a trader’s wife. He was all for gain, and little recked of\r\nseparation from me. Last month he went off to buy tea, and I remained\r\nbehind, to wander in my lonely boat on moon-lit nights over the cold\r\nwave, thinking of the happy days gone by, my reddened eyes telling of\r\ntearful dreams.’\r\n\r\n“The sweet melody of the lute had already moved my soul to pity, and\r\nnow these words pierced me to the heart again. ‘O lady,’ I cried, ‘we\r\nare companions in misfortune, and need no ceremony to be friends. Last\r\nyear I quitted the Imperial city, and fever-stricken reached this spot,\r\nwhere in its desolation, from year’s end to year’s end, no flute or\r\nguitar is heard. I live by the marshy river-bank, surrounded by yellow\r\nreeds and stunted bamboos. Day and night no sounds reach my ears save\r\nthe blood-stained note of the nightjar, the gibbon’s mournful wail.\r\nHill songs I have, and village pipes with their harsh discordant twang.\r\nBut now that I listen to thy lute’s discourse, methinks ’tis the music\r\nof the gods. Prithee sit down awhile and sing to us yet again, while I\r\ncommit thy story to writing.’\r\n\r\n“Grateful to me (for she had been standing long), the lute-girl\r\nsat down and quickly broke forth into another song, sad and soft,\r\nunlike the song of just now. Then all her hearers melted into tears\r\nunrestrained; and none flowed more freely than mine, until my bosom was\r\nwet with weeping.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best known of all the works of Po Chü-i is a narrative\r\npoem of some length entitled “The Everlasting Wrong.” It refers to the\r\nignominious downfall of the Emperor known as Ming Huang (A.D.\r\n685-762), who himself deserves a passing notice. At his accession\r\nto the throne in 712, he was called upon to face an attempt on the\r\npart of his aunt, the T‘ai-p‘ing Princess, to displace him; but this\r\nhe succeeded in crushing, and entered upon what promised to be a\r\nglorious reign. He began with economy, closing the silk factories\r\nand forbidding the palace ladies to wear jewels or embroideries,\r\nconsiderable quantities of which were actually burnt. Until 740 the\r\ncountry was fairly prosperous. The administration was improved, the\r\nempire was divided into fifteen provinces, and schools were established\r\nin every village. The Emperor was a patron of literature, and himself\r\na poet of no mean capacity. He published an edition of the Classic of\r\nFilial Piety, and caused the text to be engraved on four tablets of\r\nstone, A.D. 745. His love of war, however, and his growing\r\nextravagance, led to increased taxation. Fond of music, he founded a\r\ncollege for training youth of both sexes in this art. He surrounded\r\nhimself by a brilliant Court, welcoming such men as the poet Li Po,\r\nat first for their talents alone, but afterwards for their readiness\r\nto participate in scenes of revelry and dissipation provided for the\r\namusement of the Imperial concubine, the ever-famous Yang Kuei-fei.\r\nEunuchs were appointed to official posts, and the grossest forms of\r\nreligious superstition were encouraged. Women ceased to veil themselves\r\nas of old. Gradually the Emperor left off concerning himself with\r\naffairs of State; a serious rebellion broke out, and his Majesty sought\r\nsafety in flight to Ssŭch‘uan, returning only after having abdicated\r\nin favour of his son. The accompanying poem describes the rise of\r\nYang Kuei-fei, her tragic fate at the hands of the soldiery, and her\r\nsubsequent communication with her heart-broken lover from the world of\r\nshadows beyond the grave:--\r\n\r\n  ENNUI.--_His Imperial Majesty, a slave to beauty,\r\n                  longed for a “subverter of empires;”[15]\r\n          For years he had sought in vain\r\n                  to secure such a treasure for his palace...._\r\n\r\n  BEAUTY.--_From the Yang family came a maiden,\r\n                   just grown up to womanhood,\r\n           Reared in the inner apartments,\r\n                   altogether unknown to fame.\r\n           But nature had amply endowed her\r\n                   with a beauty hard to conceal,\r\n           And one day she was summoned\r\n                   to a place at the monarch’s side.\r\n           Her sparkling eye and merry laughter\r\n                   fascinated every beholder,\r\n           And among the powder and paint of the harem\r\n                   her loveliness reigned supreme.\r\n           In the chills of spring, by Imperial mandate,\r\n                   she bathed in the Hua-ch‘ing Pool,\r\n           Laving her body in the glassy wavelets\r\n                   of the fountain perennially warm.\r\n           Then, when she came forth, helped by attendants,\r\n                   her delicate and graceful movements\r\n           Finally gained for her gracious favour,\r\n                   captivating his Majesty’s heart._\r\n\r\n  REVELRY.--_Hair like a cloud, face like a flower,\r\n                    headdress which quivered as she walked,\r\n            Amid the delights of the Hibiscus Pavilion\r\n                    she passed the soft spring nights.\r\n            Spring nights, too short alas! for them,\r\n                    albeit prolonged till dawn,--\r\n            From this time forth no more audiences\r\n                    in the hours of early morn.\r\n            Revels and feasts in quick succession,\r\n                    ever without a break,\r\n            She chosen always for the spring excursion,\r\n                    chosen for the nightly carouse.\r\n            Three thousand peerless beauties adorned\r\n                    the apartments of the monarch’s harem,\r\n            Yet always his Majesty reserved\r\n                    his attentions for her alone.\r\n            Passing her life in a “golden house,”[16]\r\n                    with fair girls to wait on her,\r\n            She was daily wafted to ecstasy\r\n                    on the wine fumes of the banquet-hall.\r\n            Her sisters and her brothers, one and all,\r\n                    were raised to the rank of nobles.\r\n            Alas! for the ill-omened glories\r\n                    which she conferred on her family.\r\n            For thus it came about that fathers and mothers\r\n                    through the length and breadth of the empire\r\n            Rejoiced no longer over the birth of sons,\r\n                    but over the birth of daughters.\r\n            In the gorgeous palace\r\n                    piercing the grey clouds above,\r\n            Divine music, borne on the breeze,\r\n                    is spread around on all sides;\r\n            Of song and the dance\r\n                    to the guitar and flute,\r\n            All through the live long day,\r\n                    his Majesty never tires.\r\n            But suddenly comes the roll\r\n                    of the fish-skin war-drums,\r\n            Breaking rudely upon the air\r\n                    of the “Rainbow Skirt and Feather Jacket.”_\r\n\r\n  FLIGHT.--_Clouds of dust envelop\r\n                   the lofty gates of the capital.\r\n           A thousand war-chariots and ten thousand horses\r\n                   move towards the south-west.\r\n           Feathers and jewels among the throng,\r\n                   onwards and then a halt.\r\n           A hundred ~li~ beyond the western gate,\r\n                   leaving behind them the city walls,\r\n           The soldiers refuse to advance;\r\n                   nothing remains to be done\r\n           Until she of the moth-eyebrows\r\n                   perishes in sight of all.\r\n           On the ground lie gold ornaments\r\n                   with no one to pick them up,\r\n           Kingfisher wings, golden birds,\r\n                   and hairpins of costly jade.\r\n           The monarch covers his face,\r\n                   powerless to save;\r\n           And as he turns to look back,\r\n                   tears and blood flow mingled together._\r\n\r\n  EXILE.--_Across vast stretches of yellow sand\r\n                  with whistling winds,\r\n          Across cloud-capped mountain-tops\r\n                  they make their way.\r\n          Few indeed are the travellers\r\n                  who reach the heights of Mount Omi;\r\n          The bright gleam of the standards\r\n                  grows fainter day by day.\r\n          Dark the Ssŭch‘uan waters,\r\n                  dark the Ssŭch‘uan hills;\r\n          Daily and nightly his Majesty\r\n                  is consumed by bitter grief.\r\n          Travelling along, the very brightness\r\n                  of the moon saddens his heart,\r\n          And the sound of a bell through the evening rain\r\n                  severs his viscera in twain._\r\n\r\n  RETURN.--_Time passes, days go by, and once again\r\n                   he is there at the well-known spot,\r\n           And there he lingers on, unable\r\n                   to tear himself wholly away.\r\n           But from the clods of earth\r\n                   at the foot of the Ma-wei hill,\r\n           No sign of her lovely face appears,\r\n                   only the place of death.\r\n           The eyes of sovereign and minister meet,\r\n                   and robes are wet with tears,\r\n           Eastward they depart and hurry on\r\n                   to the capital at full speed._\r\n\r\n  HOME.--_There is the pool and there are the flowers,\r\n                 as of old.\r\n         There is the hibiscus of the pavilion,\r\n                 there are the willows of the palace.\r\n         In the hibiscus he sees her face,\r\n                 in the willow he sees her eyebrows:\r\n         How in the presence of these\r\n                 should tears not flow,--\r\n         In spring amid the flowers\r\n                 of the peach and plum,\r\n         In autumn rains when the leaves\r\n                 of the ~wu t‘ung~ fall?\r\n         To the south of the western palace\r\n                 are many trees,\r\n         And when their leaves cover the steps,\r\n                 no one now sweeps them away.\r\n         The hair of the Pear-Garden musicians\r\n                 is white as though with age;\r\n         The guardians of the Pepper Chamber[17]\r\n                 seem to him no longer young.\r\n         Where fireflies flit through the hall,\r\n                 he sits in silent grief;\r\n         Alone, the lamp-wick burnt out,\r\n                 he is still unable to sleep.\r\n         Slowly pass the watches,\r\n                 for the nights are now too long,\r\n         And brightly shine the constellations,\r\n                 as though dawn would never come.\r\n         Cold settles upon the duck-and-drake tiles,[18]\r\n                 and thick hoar-frost,\r\n         The kingfisher coverlet is chill,\r\n                 with none to share its warmth.\r\n         Parted by life and death,\r\n                 time still goes on,\r\n         But never once does her spirit come back\r\n                 to visit him in dreams._\r\n\r\n  SPIRIT-LAND.--_A Taoist priest of Lin-ch‘ung,\r\n                        of the Hung-tu school,\r\n                Was able, by his perfect art, to summon\r\n                        the spirits of the dead.\r\n                Anxious to relieve the fretting mind\r\n                        of his sovereign,\r\n                This magician receives orders\r\n                        to urge a diligent quest.\r\n                Borne on the clouds, charioted upon ether,\r\n                        he rushes with the speed of lightning\r\n                High up to heaven, low down to earth,\r\n                        seeking everywhere.\r\n                Above, he searches the empyrean;\r\n                        below, the Yellow Springs,\r\n                But nowhere in these vast areas\r\n                        can her place be found.\r\n                At length he hears of an Isle of the Blest\r\n                        away in mid-ocean,\r\n                Lying in realms of vacuity,\r\n                        dimly to be descried.\r\n                There gaily decorated buildings\r\n                        rise up like rainbow clouds,\r\n                And there many gentle and beautiful Immortals\r\n                        pass their days in peace.\r\n                Among them is one whose name\r\n                        sounds upon lips as Eternal,\r\n                And by her snow-white skin and flower-like face\r\n                        he knows that this is she.\r\n                Knocking at the jade door\r\n                        at the western gate of the golden palace,\r\n                He bids a fair waiting-maid announce him\r\n                        to her mistress, fairer still.\r\n                She, hearing of this embassy\r\n                        sent by the Son of Heaven,\r\n                Starts up from her dreams\r\n                        among the tapestry curtains.\r\n                Grasping her clothes and pushing away the pillow,\r\n                        she arises in haste,\r\n                And begins to adorn herself\r\n                        with pearls and jewels.\r\n                Her cloud-like coiffure, dishevelled,\r\n                        shows that she has just risen from sleep,\r\n                And with her flowery head-dress awry,\r\n                        she passes into the hall.\r\n                The sleeves of her immortal robes\r\n                        are filled out by the breeze,\r\n                As once more she seems to dance\r\n                        to the “Rainbow Skirt and Feather Jacket.”\r\n                Her features are fixed and calm,\r\n                        though myriad tears fall,\r\n                Wetting a spray of pear-bloom,\r\n                        as it were with the raindrops of spring.\r\n                Subduing her emotions, restraining her grief,\r\n                        she tenders thanks to his Majesty,\r\n                Saying how since they parted\r\n                        she has missed his form and voice;\r\n                And how, although their love on earth\r\n                        has so soon come to an end,\r\n                The days and months among the Blest\r\n                        are still of long duration.\r\n                And now she turns and gazes\r\n                        towards the abode of mortals,\r\n                But cannot discern the Imperial city\r\n                        lost in the dust and haze.\r\n                Then she takes out the old keepsakes,\r\n                        tokens of undying love,\r\n                A gold hairpin, an enamel brooch,\r\n                        and bids the magician carry these back.\r\n                One half of the hairpin she keeps,\r\n                        and one half of the enamel brooch,\r\n                Breaking with her hands the yellow gold,\r\n                        and dividing the enamel in two.\r\n                “Tell him,” she said, “to be firm of heart,\r\n                        as this gold and enamel,\r\n                And then in heaven or on earth below\r\n                        we two may meet once more.”\r\n                At parting, she confided to the magician\r\n                        many earnest messages of love,\r\n                Among the rest recalling a pledge\r\n                        mutually understood;\r\n                How on the seventh day of the seventh moon,\r\n                        in the Hall of Immortality,\r\n                At midnight, when none were near,\r\n                        he had whispered in her ear,\r\n                “I swear that we will ever fly\r\n                        like the one-winged birds,[19]\r\n                Or grow united like the tree\r\n                        with branches which twine together.”[20]\r\n                Heaven and Earth, long-lasting as they are,\r\n                        will some day pass away;\r\n                But this great wrong shall stretch out for ever,\r\n                        endless, for ever and ay._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LI HO]\r\n\r\nA precocious and short-lived poet was LI HO, of the ninth\r\ncentury. He began to write verses at the age of seven. Twenty years\r\nlater he met a strange man riding on a hornless dragon, who said to\r\nhim, “God Almighty has finished his Jade Pavilion, and has sent for you\r\nto be his secretary.” Shortly after this he died. The following is a\r\nspecimen of his poetry:--\r\n\r\n  “_With flowers on the ground like embroidery spread,\r\n  At twenty, the soft glow of wine in my head,\r\n  My white courser’s bit-tassels motionless gleam\r\n  While the gold-threaded willow scent sweeps o’er the stream.\r\n  Yet until ~she~ has smiled, all these flowers yield no ray;\r\n  When her tresses fall down the whole landscape is gay;\r\n  My hand on her sleeve as I gaze in her eyes,\r\n  A kingfisher hairpin will soon be my prize._”\r\n\r\nCHANG CHI, who also flourished in the ninth century, was\r\neighty years old when he died. He was on terms of close friendship with\r\nHan Yü, and like him, too, a vigorous opponent of both Buddhism and\r\nTaoism. The following is his most famous poem, the beauty of which,\r\nsays a commentator, lies beyond the words:--\r\n\r\n  “_Knowing, fair sir, my matrimonial thrall,\r\n  Two pearls thou sentest me, costly withal.\r\n  And I, seeing that Love thy heart possessed,\r\n  I wrapped them coldly in my silken vest._\r\n\r\n  “_For mine is a household of high degree,\r\n  My husband captain in the King’s army;\r\n  And one with wit like thine should say,\r\n  ‘The troth of wives is for ever and ay.’_\r\n\r\n  “_With thy two pearls I send thee back two tears:\r\n  Tears--that we did not meet in earlier years._”\r\n\r\nMany more poets of varying shades of excellence must here be set aside,\r\ntheir efforts often brightened by those quaint conceits which are so\r\ndear to the Chinese reader, but which approach so perilously near to\r\nbathos when they appear in foreign garb. A few specimens, torn from\r\ntheir setting, may perhaps have an interest of their own. Here is a\r\nlady complaining of the leaden-footed flight of time as marked by the\r\nwater-clock:--\r\n\r\n  “_It seems that the clepsydra\r\n          has been filled up with the sea,\r\n  To make the long, long night appear\r\n          an endless night to me!_”\r\n\r\nThe second line in the next example is peculiarly characteristic:--\r\n\r\n  “_Dusk comes, the east wind blows, and birds\r\n      pipe forth a mournful sound;\r\n  Petals, like nymphs from balconies,\r\n      come tumbling to the ground._”\r\n\r\nThe next refers to candles burning in a room where two friends are\r\nhaving a last talk on the night before parting for a long period:--\r\n\r\n  “_The very wax sheds sympathetic tears,\r\n  And gutters sadly down till dawn appears._”\r\n\r\nThis last is from a friend to a friend at a distance:--\r\n\r\n  “_Ah, when shall we ever snuff candles again,\r\n  And recall the glad hours of that evening of rain?_”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LI SHÊ]\r\n\r\nA popular poet of the ninth century was LI SHÊ, especially\r\nwell known for the story of his capture by highwaymen. The chief knew\r\nhim by name and called for a sample of his art, eliciting the following\r\nlines, which immediately secured his release:--\r\n\r\n  “_The rainy mist sweeps gently o’er the village by the stream,\r\n  When from the leafy forest glades the brigand daggers gleam....\r\n  And yet there is no need to fear, nor step from out their way,\r\n  For more than half the world consists of bigger rogues than they!_”\r\n\r\nA popular physician in great request, as well as a poet, was MA TZŬ-JAN\r\n(_d._ A.D. 880). He studied Taoism in a hostile sense, as would appear\r\nfrom the following poem by him; nevertheless, according to tradition,\r\nhe was ultimately taken up to heaven alive:--\r\n\r\n  “_In youth I went to study ~TAO~ at its living fountain-head,\r\n  And then lay tipsy half the day upon a gilded bed.\r\n  ‘What oaf is this,’ the Master cried, ‘content with human lot?’\r\n  And bade me to the world get back and call myself a sot.\r\n  But wherefore seek immortal life by means of wondrous pills?\r\n  Noise is not in the market-place, nor quiet on the hills.\r\n  The secret of perpetual youth is already known to me:\r\n  Accept with philosophic calm whatever fate may be._”\r\n\r\nHSÜ AN-CHÊN, of the ninth century, is entitled to a place among the\r\nT‘ang poets, if only for the following piece:--\r\n\r\n  “_When the Bear athwart was lying,\r\n  And the night was just on dying,\r\n  And the moon was all but gone,\r\n  How my thoughts did ramble on!_\r\n\r\n  “_Then a sound of music breaks\r\n  From a lute that some one wakes,\r\n  And I know that it is she,\r\n  The sweet maid next door to me._\r\n\r\n  “_And as the strains steal o’er me\r\n  Her moth-eyebrows rise before me,\r\n  And I feel a gentle thrill\r\n  That her fingers must be chill._\r\n\r\n  “_But doors and locks between us\r\n  So effectually screen us\r\n  That I hasten from the street\r\n  And in dreamland pray to meet._”\r\n\r\nThe following lines by TU CH’IN-NIANG, a poetess of the ninth century,\r\nare included in a collection of 300 gems of the T‘ang dynasty:--\r\n\r\n  “_I would not have thee grudge those robes\r\n          which gleam in rich array,\r\n  But I would have thee grudge the hours\r\n          of youth which glide away.\r\n  Go, pluck the blooming flower betimes,\r\n          lest when thou com’st again\r\n  Alas! upon the withered stem\r\n          no blooming flowers remain!_”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SSŬ-K‘UNG T‘U]\r\n\r\nIt is time perhaps to bring to a close the long list, which might be\r\nalmost indefinitely lengthened. SSŬ-K‘UNG T‘U (A.D. 834-908) was a\r\nsecretary in the Board of Rites, but he threw up his post and became\r\na hermit. Returning to Court in 905, he accidentally dropped part\r\nof his official insignia at an audience,--an unpardonable breach of\r\nCourt etiquette,--and was allowed to retire once more to the hills,\r\nwhere he ultimately starved himself to death through grief at the\r\nmurder of the youthful Emperor. He is commonly known as the Last of\r\nthe T‘angs; his poetry, which is excessively difficult to understand,\r\nranking correspondingly high in the estimation of Chinese critics. The\r\nfollowing philosophical poem, consisting of twenty-four apparently\r\nunconnected stanzas, is admirably adapted to exhibit the form under\r\nwhich pure Taoism commends itself to the mind of a cultivated scholar:--\r\n\r\n\r\ni.--ENERGY--ABSOLUTE.\r\n\r\n  “_Expenditure of force leads to outward decay,\r\n  Spiritual existence means inward fulness.\r\n  Let us revert to Nothing and enter the Absolute,\r\n  Hoarding up strength for Energy.\r\n  Freighted with eternal principles,\r\n  Athwart the mighty void,\r\n  Where cloud-masses darken,\r\n  And the wind blows ceaseless around,\r\n  Beyond the range of conceptions,\r\n  Let us gain the Centre,\r\n  And there hold fast without violence,\r\n  Fed from an inexhaustible supply._”\r\n\r\n\r\nii.--TRANQUIL REPOSE.\r\n\r\n  “_It dwells in quietude, speechless,\r\n  Imperceptible in the cosmos,\r\n  Watered by the eternal harmonies,\r\n  Soaring with the lonely crane.\r\n  It is like a gentle breeze in spring,\r\n  Softly bellying the flowing robe;\r\n  It is like the note of the bamboo flute,\r\n  Whose sweetness we would fain make our own.\r\n  Meeting by chance, it seems easy of access,\r\n  Seeking, we find it hard to secure.\r\n  Ever shifting in semblance,\r\n  It shifts from the grasp and is gone._”\r\n\r\n\r\niii.--SLIM--STOUT.\r\n\r\n  “_Gathering the water-plants\r\n  From the wild luxuriance of spring,\r\n  Away in the depth of a wild valley\r\n  Anon I see a lovely girl.\r\n  With green leaves the peach-trees are loaded,\r\n  The breeze blows gently along the stream,\r\n  Willows shade the winding path,\r\n  Darting orioles collect in groups.\r\n  Eagerly I press forward\r\n  As the reality grows upon me....\r\n  ’Tis the eternal theme\r\n  Which, though old, is ever new._”\r\n\r\n\r\niv.--CONCENTRATION.\r\n\r\n  “_Green pines and a rustic hut,\r\n  The sun sinking through pure air,\r\n  I take off my cap and stroll alone,\r\n  Listening to the song of birds.\r\n  No wild geese fly hither,\r\n  And she is far away;\r\n  But my thoughts make her present\r\n  As in the days gone by.\r\n  Across the water dark clouds are whirled,\r\n  Beneath the moonbeams the eyots stand revealed,\r\n  And sweet words are exchanged\r\n  Though the great River rolls between._”\r\n\r\n\r\nv.--HEIGHT--ANTIQUITY.\r\n\r\n  “_Lo the Immortal, borne by spirituality,\r\n  His hand grasping a lotus flower,\r\n  Away to Time everlasting,\r\n  Trackless through the regions of Space!\r\n  With the moon he issues from the Ladle,[21]\r\n  Speeding upon a favourable gale;\r\n  Below, Mount Hua looms dark,\r\n  And from it sounds a clear-toned bell.\r\n  Vacantly I gaze after his vanished image,\r\n  Now passed beyond the bounds of mortality....\r\n  Ah, the Yellow Emperor and Yao,\r\n  They, peerless, are his models._”\r\n\r\n\r\nvi.--REFINEMENT.\r\n\r\n  “_A jade kettle with a purchase of spring,[22]\r\n  A shower on the thatched hut\r\n  Wherein sits a gentle scholar,\r\n  With tall bamboos growing right and left,\r\n  And white clouds in the newly-clear sky,\r\n  And birds flitting in the depths of trees.\r\n  Then pillowed on his lute in the green shade,\r\n  A waterfall tumbling overhead,\r\n  Leaves dropping, not a word spoken,\r\n  The man placid, like a chrysanthemum,\r\n  Noting down the flower-glory of the season,--\r\n  A book well worthy to be read._”\r\n\r\n\r\nvii.--WASH--SMELT.\r\n\r\n  “_As iron from the mines,\r\n  As silver from lead,\r\n  So purify thy heart,\r\n  Loving the limpid and clean.\r\n  Like a clear pool in spring,\r\n  With its wondrous mirrored shapes,\r\n  So make for the spotless and true,\r\n  And, riding the moonbeam, revert to the Spiritual.\r\n  Let your gaze be upon the stars of heaven,[23]\r\n  Let your song be of the hiding hermit;[23]\r\n  Like flowing water is our to-day,\r\n  Our yesterday, the bright moon._”[24]\r\n\r\n\r\nviii.--STRENGTH.\r\n\r\n  “_The mind as though in the void,\r\n  The vitality as though of the rainbow,\r\n  Among the thousand-ell peaks of Wu,\r\n  Flying with the clouds, racing with the wind;\r\n  Drink of the spiritual, feed on force,\r\n  Store them for daily use, guard them in your heart,\r\n  Be like Him in His might,[25]\r\n  For this is to preserve your energy;\r\n  Be a peer of Heaven and Earth,\r\n  A co-worker in Divine transformation....\r\n  Seek to be full of these,\r\n  And hold fast to them alway._”\r\n\r\n\r\nix.--EMBROIDERIES.\r\n\r\n  “_If the mind has wealth and rank,\r\n  One may make light of yellow gold.\r\n  Rich pleasures pall ere long,\r\n  Simple joys deepen ever.\r\n  A mist-cloud hanging on the river bank,\r\n  Pink almond-flowers along the bough,\r\n  A flower-girt cottage beneath the moon,\r\n  A painted bridge half seen in shadow,\r\n  A golden goblet brimming with wine,\r\n  A friend with his hand on the lute....\r\n  Take these and be content;\r\n  They will swell thy heart beneath thy robe._”\r\n\r\n\r\nx.--THE NATURAL.\r\n\r\n  “_Stoop, and there it is;\r\n  Seek it not right and left.\r\n  All roads lead thither,--\r\n  One touch and you have spring![26]\r\n  As though coming upon opening flowers,\r\n  As though gazing upon the new year,\r\n  Verily I will not snatch it,\r\n  Forced, it will dwindle away.\r\n  I will be like the hermit on the hill,\r\n  Like duckweed gathered on the stream,[27]\r\n  And when emotions crowd upon me,\r\n  I will leave them to the harmonies of heaven._”\r\n\r\n\r\nxi.--SET FREE.\r\n\r\n  “_Joying in flowers without let,\r\n  Breathing the empyrean,\r\n  Through ~TAO~ reverting to ether,\r\n  And there to be wildly free,\r\n  Wide-spreading as the wind of heaven,\r\n  Lofty as the peaks of ocean,\r\n  Filled with a spiritual strength,\r\n  All creation by my side,\r\n  Before me the sun, moon, and stars,\r\n  The phœnix following behind.\r\n  In the morning I whip up my leviathans\r\n  And wash my feet in Fusang._”[28]\r\n\r\n\r\nxii.--CONSERVATION.\r\n\r\n  “_Without a word writ down,\r\n  All wit may be attained.\r\n  If words do not affect the speaker,\r\n  They seem inadequate to sorrow.[29]\r\n  Herein is the First Cause,\r\n  With which we sink or rise,\r\n  As wine in the strainer mounts high,\r\n  As cold turns back the season of flowers.\r\n  The wide-spreading dust-motes in the air,\r\n  The sudden spray-bubbles of ocean,\r\n  Shallow, deep, collected, scattered,--\r\n  You grasp ten thousand, and secure one._”\r\n\r\n\r\nxiii.--ANIMAL SPIRITS.\r\n\r\n  “_That they might come back unceasingly,\r\n  That they might be ever with us!--\r\n  The bright river, unfathomable,\r\n  The rare flower just opening,\r\n  The parrot of the verdant spring,\r\n  The willow-trees, the terrace,\r\n  The stranger from the dark hills,\r\n  The cup overflowing with clear wine....\r\n  Oh, for life to be extended,\r\n  With no dead ashes of writing,\r\n  Amid the charms of the Natural,--\r\n  Ah, who can compass it?_”\r\n\r\n\r\nxiv.--CLOSE WOVEN.\r\n\r\n  “_In all things there are veritable atoms,\r\n  Though the senses cannot perceive them,\r\n  Struggling to emerge into shape\r\n  From the wondrous workmanship of God.\r\n  Water flowing, flowers budding,\r\n  The limpid dew evaporating,\r\n  An important road, stretching far,\r\n  A dark path where progress is slow....\r\n  So words should not shock,\r\n  Nor thought be inept.\r\n  But be like the green of spring,\r\n  Like snow beneath the moon._”[30]\r\n\r\n\r\nxv.--SECLUSION.\r\n\r\n  “_Following our own bent,\r\n  Enjoying the Natural, free from curb,\r\n  Rich with what comes to hand,\r\n  Hoping some day to be with God.\r\n  To build a hut beneath the pines,\r\n  With uncovered head to pore over poetry,\r\n  Knowing only morning and eve,\r\n  But not what season it may be....\r\n  Then, if happiness is ours,\r\n  Why must there be action?\r\n  If of our own selves we can reach this point,\r\n  Can we not be said to have attained?_”\r\n\r\n\r\nxvi.--FASCINATION.\r\n\r\n  “_Lovely is the pine-grove,\r\n  With the stream eddying below,\r\n  A clear sky and a snow-clad bank,\r\n  Fishing-boats in the reach beyond.\r\n  And she, like unto jade,\r\n  Slowly sauntering, as I follow through the dark wood,\r\n  Now moving on, now stopping short,\r\n  Far away to the deep valley....\r\n  My mind quits its tenement, and is in the past,\r\n  Vague, and not to be recalled,\r\n  As though before the glow of the rising moon,\r\n  As though before the glory of autumn._”\r\n\r\n\r\nxvii.--IN TORTUOUS WAYS.\r\n\r\n  “_I climbed the Tai-hsing mountain\r\n  By the green winding path,\r\n  Vegetation like a sea of jade,\r\n  Flower-scent borne far and wide.\r\n  Struggling with effort to advance,\r\n  A sound escaped my lips,\r\n  Which seemed to be back ere ’twas gone,\r\n  As though hidden but not concealed.[31]\r\n  The eddying waters rush to and fro,\r\n  Overhead the great rukh soars and sails;\r\n  ~TAO~ does not limit itself to a shape,\r\n  But is round and square by turns._”\r\n\r\n\r\nxviii.--ACTUALITIES.\r\n\r\n  “_Choosing plain words\r\n  To express simple thoughts,\r\n  Suddenly I happened upon a recluse,\r\n  And seemed to see the heart of TAO.\r\n  Beside the winding brook,\r\n  Beneath dark pine-trees’ shade,\r\n  There was one stranger bearing a faggot,\r\n  Another listening to the lute.\r\n  And so, where my fancy led me,\r\n  Better than if I had sought it,\r\n  I heard the music of heaven,\r\n  Astounded by its rare strains._”\r\n\r\n\r\nxix.--DESPONDENT\r\n\r\n  “_A gale ruffles the stream\r\n  And trees in the forest crack;\r\n  My thoughts are bitter as death,\r\n  For she whom I asked will not come.\r\n  A hundred years slip by like water,\r\n  Riches and rank are but cold ashes,\r\n  ~TAO~ is daily passing away,\r\n  To whom shall we turn for salvation?\r\n  The brave soldier draws his sword,\r\n  And tears flow with endless lamentation;\r\n  The wind whistles, leaves fall,\r\n  And rain trickles through the old thatch._”\r\n\r\n\r\nxx.--FORM AND FEATURE.\r\n\r\n  “_After gazing fixedly upon expression and substance\r\n  The mind returns with a spiritual image,\r\n  As when seeking the outlines of waves,\r\n  As when painting the glory of spring.\r\n  The changing shapes of wind-swept clouds,\r\n  The energies of flowers and plants,\r\n  The rolling breakers of ocean,\r\n  The crags and cliffs of mountains,\r\n  All these are like mighty ~TAO~,\r\n  Skilfully woven into earthly surroundings....\r\n  To obtain likeness without form,\r\n  Is not that to possess the man?_”\r\n\r\n\r\nxxi.--THE TRANSCENDENTAL.\r\n\r\n  “_Not of the spirituality of the mind,\r\n  Nor yet of the atoms of the cosmos,\r\n  But as though reached upon white clouds,\r\n  Borne thither by pellucid breezes.\r\n  Afar, it seems at hand,\r\n  Approach, ’tis no longer there;\r\n  Sharing the nature of ~TAO~,\r\n  It shuns the limits of mortality.\r\n  It is in the piled-up hills, in tall trees,\r\n  In dark mosses, in sunlight rays....\r\n  Croon over it, think upon it;\r\n  Its faint sound eludes the ear._”\r\n\r\n\r\nxxii.--ABSTRACTION.\r\n\r\n  “_Without friends, longing to be there,\r\n  Alone, away from the common herd,\r\n  Like the crane on Mount Hou,\r\n  Like the cloud at the peak of

It is true that the second Emperor founded a College\r\nof Learning, but its members were content to continue the traditions\r\nof the Hans, and comparatively little was achieved in the line of\r\nindependent research. Foremost among the names in the above College\r\nstands that of LU YÜAN-LANG (550-625). He had been Imperial\r\nLibrarian under the preceding dynasty, and later on distinguished\r\nhimself by his defence of Confucianism against both Buddhist and Taoist\r\nattacks. He published a valuable work on the explanations of terms and\r\nphrases in the Classics and in Taoist writers.\r\n\r\nScarcely less eminent as a scholar was WEI CHÊNG (581-643),\r\nwho also gained great reputation as a military commander. He was\r\nappointed President of the Commission for drawing up the history of the\r\nprevious dynasty, and he was, in addition, a poet of no mean order. At\r\nhis death the Emperor said, “You may use copper as a mirror for the\r\nperson; you may use the past as a mirror for politics; and you may use\r\nman as a mirror to guide one’s judgment in ordinary affairs. These\r\nthree mirrors I have always carefully cherished; but now that Wei Chêng\r\nis gone, I have lost one of them.”\r\n\r\nAnother well-known scholar is YEN SHIH-KU (579-645). He was\r\nemployed upon a recension of the Classics, and also upon a new and\r\nannotated edition of the history of the Han dynasty; but his exegesis\r\nin the former case caused dissatisfaction, and he was ordered to a\r\nprovincial post. Although nominally reinstated before this degradation\r\ntook effect, his ambition was so far wounded that he ceased to be the\r\nsame man. He lived henceforth a retired and simple life.\r\n\r\nLI PO-YAO (565-648) was so sickly a child, and swallowed so\r\nmuch medicine, that his grandmother insisted on naming him Po-yao\r\n= Pharmacopœia, while his precocious cleverness earned for him the\r\nsobriquet of the Prodigy. Entering upon a public career, he neglected\r\nhis work for gaming and drink, and after a short spell of office he\r\nretired. Later on he rose once more, and completed the History of the\r\nNorthern Ch‘i Dynasty.\r\n\r\nA descendant of Confucius in the thirty-second degree, and a\r\ndistinguished scholar and public functionary, was K‘UNG YING-TA\r\n(574-648). He wrote a commentary on the Book of Odes, and is credited\r\nwith certain portions of the History of the Sui Dynasty. Besides this,\r\nhe is responsible for comments and glosses on the Great Learning and on\r\nthe Doctrine of the Mean.\r\n\r\nLexicography was perhaps the department of pure scholarship in which\r\nthe greatest advances were made. Dictionaries on the phonetic system,\r\nbased upon the work of Lu Fa-yen of the sixth century, came very much\r\ninto vogue, as opposed to those on the radical system initiated by Hsü\r\nShên. Not that the splendid work of the latter was allowed to suffer\r\nfrom neglect. LI YANG-PING, of the eighth century, devoted\r\nmuch time and labour to improving and adding to its pages. The latter\r\nwas a Government official, and when filling a post as magistrate in\r\n763, he is said to have obtained rain during a drought by threatening\r\nthe City God with the destruction of his temple unless his prayers were\r\nanswered within three days.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHANG CHIH-HO]\r\n\r\nCHANG CHIH-HO (eighth century), author of a work on the conservation\r\nof vitality, was of a romantic turn of mind and especially fond of\r\nTaoist speculations. He took office under the Emperor Su Tsung of the\r\nT‘ang dynasty, but got into some trouble and was banished. Soon after\r\nthis he shared in a general pardon; whereupon he fled to the woods\r\nand mountains and became a wandering recluse, calling himself the Old\r\nFisherman of the Mists and Waters. He spent his time in angling, but\r\nused no bait, his object not being to catch fish. When asked why he\r\nroamed about, Chang answered and said, “With the empyrean as my home,\r\nthe bright moon my constant companion, and the four seas my inseparable\r\nfriends,--what mean you by _roaming_?” And when a friend offered him\r\na comfortable home instead of his poor boat, he replied, “I prefer to\r\nfollow the gulls into cloudland, rather than to bury my eternal self\r\nbeneath the dust of the world.”\r\n\r\nThe author of the _T‘ung Tien_, an elaborate treatise on the\r\nconstitution, still extant, was TU YU (_d._ 812). It is\r\ndivided into eight sections under Political Economy, Examinations\r\nand Degrees, Government Offices, Rites, Music, Military Discipline,\r\nGeography, and National Defences.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LIU TSUNG-YÜAN]\r\n\r\nAmong writers of general prose literature, LIU TSUNG-YÜAN\r\n(773-819) has left behind him much that for purity of style and\r\nfelicity of expression has rarely been surpassed. Besides being\r\npoet, essayist, and calligraphist, he was a Secretary in the Board of\r\nRites. There he became involved in a conspiracy, and was banished to a\r\ndistant spot, where he died. His views were deeply tinged with Buddhist\r\nthought, for which he was often severely censured, once in a letter by\r\nhis friend and master, Han Yü. These few lines are part of his reply on\r\nthe latter occasion:--\r\n\r\n“The features I admire in Buddhism are those which are coincident with\r\nthe principles enunciated in our own sacred books. And I do not think\r\nthat, even were the holy sages of old to revisit the earth, they would\r\nfairly be able to denounce these. Now, Han Yü objects to the Buddhist\r\ncommandments. He objects to the bald pates of the priests, their dark\r\nrobes, their renunciation of domestic ties, their idleness, and life\r\ngenerally at the expense of others. So do I. But Han Yü misses the\r\nkernel while railing at the husk. He sees the lode, but not the ore. I\r\nsee both; hence my partiality for this faith.\r\n\r\n“Again, intercourse with men of this religion does not necessarily\r\nimply conversion. Even if it did, Buddhism admits no envious rivalry\r\nfor place or power. The majority of its adherents love only to lead a\r\nsimple life of contemplation amid the charms of hill and stream. And\r\nwhen I turn my gaze towards the hurry-scurry of the age, in its daily\r\nrace for the seals and tassels of office, I ask myself if I am to\r\nreject those in order to take my place among the ranks of these.\r\n\r\n“The Buddhist priest, Hao-ch‘u, is a man of placid temperament and\r\nof passions subdued. He is a fine scholar. His only joy is to muse\r\no’er flood and fell, with occasional indulgence in the delights of\r\ncomposition. His family follow in the same path. He is independent of\r\nall men, and no more to be compared with those heterodox sages of whom\r\nwe make so much than with the vulgar herd of the greedy, grasping world\r\naround us.”\r\n\r\nOn this the commentator remarks, that one must have the genius of Han\r\nYü to condemn Buddhism, the genius of Liu Tsung-yüan to indulge in it.\r\n\r\nHere is a short study on a great question:--\r\n\r\n“Over the western hills the road trends away towards the north, and on\r\nthe farther side of the pass separates into two. The westerly branch\r\nleads to nowhere in particular; but if you follow the other, which\r\ntakes a north-easterly turn, for about a quarter of a mile, you will\r\nfind that the path ends abruptly, while the stream forks to enclose\r\na steep pile of boulders. On the summit of this pile there is what\r\nappears to be an elegantly built look-out tower; below, as it were a\r\nbattlemented wall, pierced by a city gate, through which one gazes into\r\ndarkness. A stone thrown in here falls with a splash suggestive of\r\nwater, and the reverberations of this sound are audible for some time.\r\nThere is a way round from behind up to the top, whence nothing is seen\r\nfar and wide except groves of fine straight trees, which, strange to\r\nsay, are grouped symmetrically, as if by an artist’s hand.\r\n\r\n“Now, I have always had my doubts about the existence of a God, but\r\nthis scene made me think He really must exist. At the same time,\r\nhowever, I began to wonder why He did not place it in some worthy\r\ncentre of civilisation, rather than in this out-of-the-way barbarous\r\nregion, where for centuries there has been no one to enjoy its beauty.\r\nAnd so, on the other hand, such waste of labour and incongruity of\r\nposition disposed me to think that there cannot be a God after all.”\r\n\r\nOne favourite piece is a letter which Liu Tsung-yüan writes in a\r\nbantering style to congratulate a well-to-do literary man on having\r\nlost everything in a fire, especially, as he explains, if the victim\r\nhas been “utterly and irretrievably beggared.” It will give such a\r\nrare opportunity, he points out, to show the world that there was no\r\nconnection whatever between worldly means and literary reputation.\r\n\r\nA well-known satirical piece by Liu Tsung-yüan is entitled “Catching\r\nSnakes,” and is directed against the hardships of over-taxation:--\r\n\r\n“In the wilds of Hu-kuang there is an extraordinary kind of snake,\r\nhaving a black body with white rings. Deadly fatal, even to the grass\r\nand trees it may chance to touch; in man, its bite is absolutely\r\nincurable. Yet, if caught and prepared, when dry, in the form of cakes,\r\nthe flesh of this snake will soothe excitement, heal leprous sores,\r\nremove sloughing flesh, and expel evil spirits. And so it came about\r\nthat the Court physician, acting under Imperial orders, exacted from\r\neach family a return of two of these snakes every year; but as few\r\npersons were able to comply with the demand, it was subsequently made\r\nknown that the return of snakes was to be considered in lieu of the\r\nusual taxes. Thereupon there ensued a general stampede among the people\r\nof those parts.”\r\n\r\nIt turned out, however, that snake-catching was actually less deadly\r\nthan paying such taxes as were exacted from those who dared not face\r\nits risks and elected to contribute in the ordinary way. One man,\r\nwhose father and grandfather had both perished from snake-bites,\r\ndeclared that after all he was better off than his neighbours, who were\r\nground down and beggared by the iniquities of the tax-gatherer. “Harsh\r\ntyrants,” he explained, “sweep down upon us, and throw everybody and\r\neverything, even to the brute beasts, into paroxysms of terror and\r\ndisorder. But I,--I get up in the morning and look into the jar where\r\nmy snakes are kept; and if they are still there, I lie down at night\r\nin peace. At the appointed time, I take care that they are fit to be\r\nhanded in; and when that is done, I retire to enjoy the produce of\r\nmy farm and complete the allotted span of my existence. Only twice a\r\nyear have I to risk my life: the rest is peaceful enough and not to be\r\ncompared with the daily round of annoyance which falls to the share of\r\nmy fellow-villagers.”\r\n\r\nA similar satire on over-government introduces a deformed gardener\r\ncalled Camel-back. This man was extraordinarily successful as a\r\nnurseryman:--\r\n\r\n“One day a customer asked him how this was so; to which he replied,\r\n‘Old Camel-back cannot make trees live or thrive. He can only let them\r\nfollow their natural tendencies. Now in planting trees, be careful to\r\nset the root straight, to smooth the earth around them, to use good\r\nmould, and to ram it down well. Then, don’t touch them; don’t think\r\nabout them; don’t go and look at them; but leave them alone to take\r\ncare of themselves, and nature will do the rest. I only avoid trying\r\nto make my trees grow. I have no special method of cultivation, no\r\nspecial means for securing luxuriance of growth. I only don’t spoil\r\nthe fruit. I have no way of getting it either early or in abundance.\r\nOther gardeners set with bent root and neglect the mould. They heap\r\nup either too much earth or too little. Or if not this, then they\r\nbecome too fond of and too anxious about their trees, and are for\r\never running backwards and forwards to see how they are growing;\r\nsometimes scratching them to make sure they are still alive, or shaking\r\nthem about to see if they are sufficiently firm in the ground; thus\r\nconstantly interfering with the natural bias of the tree, and turning\r\ntheir affection and care into an absolute bane and a curse. I only\r\ndon’t do these things. That’s all.’\r\n\r\n“‘Can these principles you have just now set forth be applied to\r\ngovernment?’ asked his listener. ‘Ah!’ replied Camel-back, ‘I only\r\nunderstand nursery-gardening: government is not my trade. Still, in\r\nthe village where I live, the officials are for ever issuing all kinds\r\nof orders, as if greatly compassionating the people, though really to\r\ntheir utter injury. Morning and night the underlings come round and\r\nsay, ‘His Honour bids us urge on your ploughing, hasten your planting,\r\nand superintend your harvest. Do not delay with your spinning and\r\nweaving. Take care of your children. Rear poultry and pigs. Come\r\ntogether when the drum beats. Be ready at the sound of the rattle.’\r\nThus are we poor people badgered from morn till eve. We have not a\r\nmoment to ourselves. How could any one flourish and develop naturally\r\nunder such conditions?’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HAN YÜ]\r\n\r\nIn his prose writings Han Yü showed even more variety of subject than\r\nin his verse. His farewell words to his dead friend Liu Tsung-yüan,\r\nread, according to Chinese custom, by the side of the bier or at the\r\ngrave, and then burnt as a means of communicating them to the deceased,\r\nare widely known to his countrymen:--\r\n\r\n“Alas! Tzŭ-hou, and hast thou come to this pass?--Fool that I am! is\r\nit not the pass to which mortals have ever come? Man is born into the\r\nworld like a dream: what need has he to take note of gain or loss?\r\nWhile the dream lasts, he may sorrow or may joy; but when the awakening\r\nis at hand, why cling regretfully to the past?\r\n\r\n“’Twere well for all things an they had no worth. The excellence of\r\nits wood is the bane of the tree. And thou, whose early genius knew no\r\ncurb, weaver of the jewelled words, thou wilt be remembered when the\r\nimbeciles of fortune and place are forgot.\r\n\r\n“The unskilful bungler hacks his hands and streams with sweat, while\r\nthe expert craftsman looks on with folded arms. O my friend, thy work\r\nwas not for this age; though I, a bungler, have found employment in the\r\nservice of the State. Thou didst know thyself above the common herd;\r\nbut when in shame thou didst depart never to return, the Philistines\r\nusurped thy place.\r\n\r\n“Alas! Tzŭ-hou, now thou art no more. But thy last wish, that I should\r\ncare for thy little son, is still ringing sadly in my ears. The\r\nfriendships of the day are those of self-interest alone. How can I feel\r\nsure that I shall live to carry out thy behest? I did not arrogate to\r\nmyself this duty. Thou thyself hast bidden me to the task; and, by the\r\nGods above, I will not betray thy trust.\r\n\r\n“Thou hast gone to thy eternal home, and wilt not return. With these\r\nsacrifices by thy coffin’s side, I utter an affectionate farewell.”\r\n\r\nThe following passages are taken from his essay on the Way or Method of\r\nConfucianism:--\r\n\r\n“Had there been no sages of old, the race of man would have long since\r\nbecome extinct. Men have not fur and feathers and scales to adjust\r\nthe temperature of their bodies; neither have they claws and fangs\r\nto aid them in the struggle for food. Hence their organisation, as\r\nfollows:--The sovereign issues commands. The minister carries out these\r\ncommands, and makes them known to the people. The people produce grain\r\nand flax and silk, fashion articles of everyday use, and interchange\r\ncommodities, in order to fulfil their obligations to their rulers. The\r\nsovereign who fails to issue his commands loses his _raison d’être_;\r\nthe minister who fails to carry out his sovereign’s commands, and to\r\nmake them known to the people, loses his _raison d’être_; the people\r\nwho fail to produce grain and flax and silk, fashion articles of\r\neveryday use, and interchange commodities, in order to fulfil their\r\nobligations to their rulers, should lose their heads.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“And if I am asked what Method is this, I reply that it is what I call\r\n_the_ Method, and not merely a method like those of Lao Tzŭ and Buddha.\r\nThe Emperor Yao handed it down to the Emperor Shun; the Emperor Shun\r\nhanded it down to the Great Yü; and so on until it reached Confucius,\r\nand lastly Mencius, who died without transmitting it to any one else.\r\nThen followed the heterodox schools of Hsün and Yang, wherein much\r\nthat was essential was passed over, while the criterion was vaguely\r\nformulated. In the days before Chou Kung, the Sages were themselves\r\nrulers; hence they were able to secure the reception of their Method.\r\nIn the days after Chou Kung, the Sages were all high officers of State;\r\nhence its duration through a long period of time.\r\n\r\n“And now, it will be asked, what is the remedy? I answer that unless\r\nthese false doctrines are rooted out, the true faith will not prevail.\r\nLet us insist that the followers of Lao Tzŭ and Buddha behave\r\nthemselves like ordinary mortals. Let us burn their books. Let us turn\r\ntheir temples into dwelling-houses. Let us make manifest the Method\r\nof our ancient kings, in order that men may be led to embrace its\r\nteachings.”\r\n\r\nOf the character of Han Yü’s famous ultimatum to the crocodile, which\r\nall Chinese writers have regarded as a real creature, though probably\r\nthe name is but an allegorical veil, the following extract may\r\nsuffice:--\r\n\r\n“O Crocodile! thou and I cannot rest together here. The Son of Heaven\r\nhas confided this district and this people to my charge; and thou, O\r\ngoggle-eyed, by disturbing the peace of this river and devouring the\r\npeople and their domestic animals, the bears, the boars, and deer\r\nof the neighbourhood, in order to batten thyself and reproduce thy\r\nkind,--thou art challenging me to a struggle of life and death. And\r\nI, though of weakly frame, am I to bow the knee and yield before a\r\ncrocodile? No! I am the lawful guardian of this place, and I would\r\nscorn to decline thy challenge, even were it to cost me my life.\r\n\r\n“Still, in virtue of my commission from the Son of Heaven, I am bound\r\nto give fair warning; and thou, O crocodile, if thou art wise, will\r\npay due heed to my words. There before thee lies the broad ocean, the\r\ndomain alike of the whale and the shrimp. Go thither and live in peace.\r\nIt is but the journey of a day.”\r\n\r\nThe death of a dearly loved nephew, comparatively near to him in age,\r\ndrew from Han Yü a long and pathetic “In Memoriam,” conveyed, as\r\nmentioned above, to the ears of the departed through the medium of fire\r\nand smoke. These are two short extracts:--\r\n\r\n“The line of my noble-hearted brother has indeed been prematurely\r\ncut off. Thy pure intelligence, hope of the family, survives not to\r\ncontinue the traditions of his house. Unfathomable are the appointments\r\nof what men call Heaven: inscrutable are the workings of the unseen:\r\nunknowable are the mysteries of eternal truth: unrecognisable those who\r\nare destined to attain to old age!\r\n\r\n“Henceforth my grey hairs will grow white, my strength fail. Physically\r\nand mentally hurrying on to decay, how long before I shall follow thee?\r\nIf there is knowledge after death, this separation will be but for\r\na little while. If there is not knowledge after death, so will this\r\nsorrow be but for a little while, and then no more sorrow for ever.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“O ye blue heavens, when shall my sorrow have end? Henceforth the world\r\nhas no charms. I will get me a few acres on the banks of the Ying, and\r\nthere await the end, teaching my son and thy son, if haply they may\r\ngrow up,--my daughter and thy daughter, until their day of marriage\r\ncomes. Alas! though words fail, love endureth. Dost thou hear, or dost\r\nthou not hear? Woe is me: Heaven bless thee!”\r\n\r\nOf all Han Yü’s writings in prose or in verse, there was not one which\r\ncaused anything like the sensation produced by his memorial to the\r\nEmperor on the subject of Buddha’s bone. The fact was, Buddhism was\r\nmaking vast strides in popular esteem, and but for some such bold\r\nstand as was made on this occasion by a leading man, the prestige of\r\nConfucianism would have received a staggering blow. Here is an extract\r\nfrom this fiery document, which sent its author into exile and nearly\r\ncost him his life:--\r\n\r\n“Your servant has now heard that instructions have been issued to\r\nthe priestly community to proceed to Fêng-hsiang and receive a bone\r\nof Buddha, and that from a high tower your Majesty will view its\r\nintroduction into the Imperial Palace; also that orders have been sent\r\nto the various temples, commanding that the relic be received with the\r\nproper ceremonies. Now, foolish though your servant may be, he is well\r\naware that your Majesty does not do this in the vain hope of deriving\r\nadvantages therefrom; but that in the fulness of our present plenty,\r\nand in the joy which reigns in the heart of all, there is a desire to\r\nfall in with the wishes of the people in the celebration at the capital\r\nof this delusive mummery. For how could the wisdom of your Majesty\r\nstoop to participate in such ridiculous beliefs? Still the people are\r\nslow of perception and easily beguiled; and should they behold your\r\nMajesty thus earnestly worshipping at the feet of Buddha, they would\r\ncry out, ‘See! the Son of Heaven, the All-Wise, is a fervent believer;\r\nwho are we, his people, that we should spare our bodies?’ Then would\r\nensue a scorching of heads and burning of fingers; crowds would collect\r\ntogether, and, tearing off their clothes and scattering their money,\r\nwould spend their time from morn to eve in imitation of your Majesty’s\r\nexample. The result would be that by and by young and old, seized with\r\nthe same enthusiasm, would totally neglect the business of their lives;\r\nand should your Majesty not prohibit it, they would be found flocking\r\nto the temples, ready to cut off an arm or slice their bodies as an\r\noffering to the god. Thus would our traditions and customs be seriously\r\ninjured, and ourselves become a laughing-stock on the face of the\r\nearth;--truly, no small matter!\r\n\r\n“For Buddha was a barbarian. His language was not the language of\r\nChina. His clothes were of an alien cut. He did not utter the\r\nmaxims of our ancient rulers, nor conform to the customs which they\r\nhave handed down. He did not appreciate the bond between prince and\r\nminister, the tie between father and son. Supposing, indeed, this\r\nBuddha had come to our capital in the flesh, under an appointment from\r\nhis own State, then your Majesty might have received him with a few\r\nwords of admonition, bestowing on him a banquet and a suit of clothes,\r\nprevious to sending him out of the country with an escort of soldiers,\r\nand thereby have avoided any dangerous influence on the minds of the\r\npeople. But what are the facts? The bone of a man long since dead and\r\ndecomposed is to be admitted, forsooth, within the precincts of the\r\nImperial Palace! Confucius said, ‘Pay all respect to spiritual beings,\r\nbut keep them at a distance.’ And so, when the princes of old paid\r\nvisits of condolence to one another, it was customary for them to send\r\non a magician in advance, with a peach-wand in his hand, whereby to\r\nexpel all noxious influences previous to the arrival of his master. Yet\r\nnow your Majesty is about to causelessly introduce a disgusting object,\r\npersonally taking part in the proceedings, without the intervention\r\neither of the magician or of his peach-wand. Of the officials, not one\r\nhas raised his voice against it; of the censors, not one has pointed\r\nout the enormity of such an act. Therefore your servant, overwhelmed\r\nwith shame for the censors, implores your Majesty that these bones\r\nbe handed over for destruction by fire or water, whereby the root of\r\nthis great evil may be exterminated for all time, and the people know\r\nhow much the wisdom of your Majesty surpasses that of ordinary men.\r\nThe glory of such a deed will be beyond all praise. And should the\r\nLord Buddha have power to avenge this insult by the infliction of some\r\nmisfortune, then let the vials of his wrath be poured out upon the\r\nperson of your servant, who now calls Heaven to witness that he will\r\nnot repent him of his oath.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LI HUA]\r\n\r\nA writer named LI HUA, of whom little is known except that\r\nhe flourished in the ninth century, has left behind him one very much\r\nadmired piece entitled “On an Old Battlefield”:--\r\n\r\n“Vast, vast,--a limitless extent of flat sand, without a human being\r\nin sight, girdled by a stream and dotted with hills, where in the\r\ndismal twilight the wind moans at the setting sun. Shrubs gone: grass\r\nwithered: all chill as the hoar-frost of early morn. The birds of the\r\nair fly past: the beasts of the field shun the spot; for it is, as I\r\nwas informed by the keeper, the site of an old battlefield. ‘Many a\r\ntime and oft,’ said he, ‘has an army been overthrown on this spot; and\r\nthe voices of the dead may frequently be heard weeping and wailing in\r\nthe darkness of the night.’”\r\n\r\nThis is how the writer calls up in imagination the ghastly scene of\r\nlong ago:--\r\n\r\n“And now the cruel spear does its work, the startled sand blinds the\r\ncombatants locked fast in the death-struggle; while hill and vale\r\nand stream groan beneath the flash and crash of arms. By and by, the\r\nchill cold shades of night fall upon them, knee-deep in snow, beards\r\nstiff with ice. The hardy vulture seeks its nest: the strength of the\r\nwar-horse is broken. Clothes are of no avail; hands frost-bitten,\r\nflesh cracked. Even nature lends her aid to the Tartars, contributing\r\na deadly blast, the better to complete the work of slaughter begun.\r\nAmbulance waggons block the way: our men succumb to flank attacks.\r\nTheir officers have surrendered: their general is dead. The river is\r\nchoked with corpses to its topmost banks: the fosses of the Great Wall\r\nare swimming over with blood. All distinctions are obliterated in that\r\nheap of rotting bones....\r\n\r\n“Faintly and more faintly beats the drum. Strength exhausted, arrows\r\nspent, bow-strings snapped, swords shattered, the two armies fall upon\r\none another in the supreme struggle for life or death. To yield is to\r\nbecome the barbarian’s slave: to fight is to mingle our bones with the\r\ndesert sand....\r\n\r\n“No sound of bird now breaks from the hushed hillside. All is still\r\nsave the wind whistling through the long night. Ghosts of the dead\r\nwander hither and thither in the gloom: spirits from the nether world\r\ncollect under the dark clouds. The sun rises and shines coldly over the\r\ntrampled grass, while the fading moon still twinkles upon the frost\r\nflakes scattered around. What sight more horrible than this!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MEN OF T‘ANG]\r\n\r\nThe havoc wrought by the dreaded Tartars is indeed the theme of many\r\na poem in prose as well as in verse. The following lines by CH’ÊN\r\nT‘AO, of about this date, record a patriotic oath of indignant\r\nvolunteers and the mournful issue of fruitless valour:--\r\n\r\n  “_They swore the Huns should perish: they would die if needs they\r\n      must....\r\n  And now five thousand, sable-clad, have bit the Tartar dust.\r\n  Along the river-bank their bones lie scattered where they may,\r\n  But still their forms in dreams arise to fair ones far away._”\r\n\r\nAmong their other glories, the T‘angs may be said to have witnessed the\r\nbirth of popular literature, soon to receive, in common with classical\r\nscholarship, an impetus the like of which had never yet been felt.\r\n\r\nBut we must now take leave of this dynasty, the name of which has\r\nsurvived in common parlance to this day. For just as the northerners\r\nare proud to call themselves “sons of Han,” so do the Chinese of the\r\nmore southern provinces still delight to be known as the “men of\r\nT‘ang.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE FIFTH\r\n\r\n_THE SUNG DYNASTY_ (A.D. 900-1200)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE INVENTION OF BLOCK-PRINTING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe T‘ang dynasty was brought to an end in 907, and during the\r\nsucceeding fifty years the empire experienced no fewer than five\r\nseparate dynastic changes. It was not a time favourable to literary\r\neffort; still production was not absolutely at a standstill, and some\r\nminor names have come down to us.\r\n\r\nOf CHANG PI, for instance, of the later Chou dynasty, little\r\nis known, except that he once presented a voluminous memorial to his\r\nsovereign in the hope of staving off political collapse. The memorial,\r\nwe are told, was much admired, but the advice contained in it was not\r\nacted upon. These few lines of his occur in many a poetical garland:--\r\n\r\n  “_After parting, dreams possessed me, and I wandered you know where,\r\n  And we sat in the verandah, and you sang the sweet old air.\r\n  Then I woke, with no one near me save the moon, still shining on,\r\n  And lighting up dead petals which like you have passed and gone._”\r\n\r\nThere is, however, at least one name of absorbing interest to the\r\nforeign student. FÊNG TAO (881-954) is best known to the\r\nChinese as a versatile politician who served first and last under no\r\nless than ten Emperors of four different Houses, and gave himself a\r\nsobriquet which finds its best English equivalent in “The Vicar of\r\nBray.” He presented himself at the Court of the second Emperor of\r\nthe Liao dynasty and positively asked for a post. He said he had no\r\nhome, no money, and very little brains; a statement which appears to\r\nhave appealed forcibly to the Tartar monarch, who at once appointed\r\nhim grand tutor to the heir-apparent. By foreigners, on the other\r\nhand, he will be chiefly remembered as the inventor of the art of\r\nblock-printing. It seems probable, indeed, that some crude form of this\r\ninvention had been already known early in the T‘ang dynasty, but until\r\nthe date of Fêng Tao it was certainly not applied to the production\r\nof books. Six years after his death the “fire-led” House of Sung was\r\nfinally established upon the throne, and thenceforward the printing of\r\nbooks from blocks became a familiar handicraft with the Chinese people.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GOLDEN TARTARS]\r\n\r\nWith the advent of this new line, we pass, as the Chinese fairy-stories\r\nsay, to “another heaven and earth.” The various departments of history,\r\nclassical scholarship, general literature, lexicography, and poetry\r\nwere again filled with enthusiastic workers, eagerly encouraged by a\r\nsuccession of enlightened rulers. And although there was a falling-off\r\nconsequent upon the irruption of the Golden Tartars in 1125-1127, when\r\nthe ex-Emperor and his newly appointed successor were carried captive\r\nto the north, nevertheless the Sungs managed to create a great epoch,\r\nand are justly placed in the very first rank among the builders of\r\nChinese literature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nHISTORY--CLASSICAL AND GENERAL LITERATURE\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OU-YANG HSIU]\r\n\r\nThe first move made in the department of history was nothing less than\r\nto re-write the whole of the chronicles of the T‘ang dynasty. The usual\r\nscheme had already been carried out by Liu Hsü (897-946), a learned\r\nscholar of the later Chin dynasty, but on many grounds the result was\r\npronounced unsatisfactory, and steps were taken to supersede it. The\r\nexecution of this project was entrusted to Ou-yang Hsiu and Sung Ch‘i,\r\nboth of whom were leading men in the world of letters. OU-YANG\r\nHSIU (1007-1072) had been brought up in poverty, his mother\r\nteaching him to write with a reed. By the time he was fifteen his great\r\nabilities began to attract attention, and later on he came out first on\r\nthe list of candidates for the third or highest degree. His public life\r\nwas a chequered one, owing to the bold positions he took up in defence\r\nof what he believed to be right, regardless of personal interest.\r\nBesides the dynastic history, he wrote on all kinds of subjects, grave\r\nand gay, including an exposition of the Book of Poetry, a work on\r\nancient inscriptions, anecdotes of the men of his day, an elaborate\r\ntreatise on the peony, poetry and essays without end. The following is\r\na specimen of his lighter work, greatly admired for the beauty of its\r\nstyle, and diligently read by all students of composition. The theme,\r\nas the reader will perceive, is the historian himself:--\r\n\r\n“The district of Ch‘u is entirely surrounded by hills, and the peaks to\r\nthe south-west are clothed with a dense and beautiful growth of trees,\r\nover which the eye wanders in rapture away to the confines of Shantung.\r\nA walk of two or three miles on those hills brings one within earshot\r\nof the sound of falling water, which gushes forth from a ravine known\r\nas the Wine-Fountain; while hard by in a nook at a bend of the road\r\nstands a kiosque, commonly spoken of as the Old Drunkard’s Arbour. It\r\nwas built by a Buddhist priest, called Deathless Wisdom, who lived\r\namong these hills, and who received the above name from the Governor.\r\nThe latter used to bring his friends hither to take wine; and as he\r\npersonally was incapacitated by a very few cups, and was, moreover,\r\nwell stricken in years, he gave himself the sobriquet of the Old\r\nDrunkard. But it was not wine that attracted him to this spot. It was\r\nthe charming scenery, which wine enabled him to enjoy.\r\n\r\n“The sun’s rays peeping at dawn through the trees, by and by to be\r\nobscured behind gathering clouds, leaving naught but gloom around, give\r\nto this spot the alternations of morning and night. The wild-flowers\r\nexhaling their perfume from the darkness of some shady dell, the\r\nluxuriant foliage of the dense forest of beautiful trees, the clear\r\nfrosty wind, and the naked boulders of the lessening torrent,--these\r\nare the indications of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Morning\r\nis the time to go thither, returning with the shades of night, and\r\nalthough the place presents a different aspect with the changes of\r\nthe seasons, its charms are subject to no interruption, but continue\r\nalway. Burden-carriers sing their way along the road, travellers rest\r\nawhile under the trees, shouts from one, responses from another, old\r\npeople hobbling along, children in arms, children dragged along by\r\nhand, backwards and forwards all day long without a break,--these are\r\nthe people of Ch‘u. A cast in the stream and a fine fish taken from\r\nsome spot where the eddying pools begin to deepen; a draught of cool\r\nwine from the fountain, and a few such dishes of meats and fruits as\r\nthe hills are able to provide,--these, nicely spread out beforehand,\r\nconstitute the Governor’s feast. And in the revelry of the banquet-hour\r\nthere is no thought of toil or trouble. Every archer hits his mark, and\r\nevery player wins his _partie_; goblets flash from hand to hand, and a\r\nbuzz of conversation is heard as the guests move unconstrainedly about.\r\nAmong them is an old man with white hair, bald at the top of his head.\r\nThis is the drunken Governor, who, when the evening sun kisses the\r\ntips of the hills and the falling shadows are drawn out and blurred,\r\nbends his steps homewards in company with his friends. Then in the\r\ngrowing darkness are heard sounds above and sounds below; the beasts\r\nof the field and the birds of the air are rejoicing at the departure\r\nof man. They, too, can rejoice in hills and in trees, but they cannot\r\nrejoice as man rejoices. So also the Governor’s friends. They rejoice\r\nwith him, though they know not at what it is that he rejoices. Drunk,\r\nhe can rejoice with them, sober, he can discourse with them,--such is\r\nthe Governor. And should you ask who is the Governor, I reply, ‘Ou-yang\r\nHsiu of Lu-ling.’”\r\n\r\nBesides dwelling upon the beauty of this piece as vividly portraying\r\nthe spirit of the age in which it was written, the commentator proudly\r\npoints out that in it the particle _yeh_, with influences as subtle as\r\nthose of the Greek γε, occurs no fewer than twenty times.\r\n\r\nThe next piece is entitled “An Autumn Dirge,” and refers to the sudden\r\ncollapse of summer, so common a phenomenon in the East:--\r\n\r\n“One night I had just sat down to my books, when suddenly I heard a\r\nsound far away towards the south-west. Listening intently, I wondered\r\nwhat it could be. On it came, at first like the sighing of a gentle\r\nzephyr ... gradually deepening into the plash of waves upon a surf-beat\r\nshore ... the roaring of huge breakers in the startled night, amid\r\nhowling storm-gusts of wind and rain. It burst upon the hanging bell,\r\nand set every one of its pendants tinkling into tune. It seemed like\r\nthe muffled march of soldiers, hurriedly advancing, bit in mouth, to\r\nthe attack, when no shouted orders rend the air, but only the tramp of\r\nmen and horses meet the ear.\r\n\r\n“‘Boy,’ said I, ‘what noise is that? Go forth and see.’ ‘Sir,’ replied\r\nthe boy on his return, ‘the moon and stars are brightly shining: the\r\nSilver River spans the sky. No sound of man is heard without: ’tis but\r\nthe whispering of the trees.’\r\n\r\n“‘Alas!’ I cried, ‘autumn is upon us. And is it thus, O boy, that\r\nautumn comes?--autumn, the cruel and the cold; autumn, the season of\r\nrack and mist; autumn, the season of cloudless skies; autumn, the\r\nseason of piercing blasts; autumn, the season of desolation and blight!\r\nChill is the sound that heralds its approach, and then it leaps upon\r\nus with a shout. All the rich luxuriance of green is changed, all the\r\nproud foliage of the forest swept down to earth, withered beneath the\r\nicy breath of the destroyer. For autumn is nature’s chief executioner,\r\nand its symbol is darkness. It has the temper of steel, and its symbol\r\nis a sharp sword. It is the avenging angel, riding upon an atmosphere\r\nof death. As spring is the epoch of growth, so autumn is the epoch of\r\nmaturity. And sad is the hour when maturity is passed, for that which\r\npasses its prime must die.\r\n\r\n“‘Still, what is this to plants and trees, which fade away in their due\r\nseason?... But stay; there is man, man the divinest of all things. A\r\nhundred cares wreck his heart, countless anxieties trace their wrinkles\r\non his brow, until his inmost self is bowed beneath the burden of life.\r\nAnd swifter still he hurries to decay when vainly striving to attain\r\nthe unattainable, or grieving over his ignorance of that which can\r\nnever be known. Then comes the whitening hair--and why not? Has man an\r\nadamantine frame, that he should outlast the trees of the field? Yet,\r\nafter all, who is it, save himself, that steals his strength away? Tell\r\nme, O boy, what right has man to accuse his autumn blast?’\r\n\r\n“My boy made no answer. He was fast asleep. No sound reached me save\r\nthat of the cricket chirping its response to my dirge.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe other leading historian of this period was SUNG CH’I\r\n(998-1061), who began his career by beating his elder brother at the\r\ngraduates’ examination. He was, however, placed tenth, instead of\r\nfirst, by Imperial command, and in accordance with the precedence of\r\nbrothers. He rose to high office, and was also a voluminous writer.\r\nA great favourite at Court, it is related that he was once at some\r\nImperial festivity when he began to feel cold. The Emperor bade one of\r\nthe ladies of the seraglio lend him a tippet, whereupon about a dozen\r\nof the girls each offered hers. But Sung Ch‘i did not like to seem\r\nto favour any one, and rather than offend the rest, continued to sit\r\nand shiver. The so-called New History of the T‘ang Dynasty, which he\r\nproduced in co-operation with Ou-yang Hsiu, is generally regarded as\r\na distinct improvement upon the work of Liu Hsü. It has not, however,\r\nactually superseded the latter work, which is still included among the\r\nrecognised dynastic histories, and stands side by side with its rival.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SSŬ-MA KUANG]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile another star had risen, in magnitude to be compared only\r\nwith the effulgent genius of Ssŭ-ma Ch‘ien. SSŬ-MA KUANG (1019-1086)\r\nentered upon an official career and rose to be Minister of State. But\r\nhe opposed the great reformer, Wang An-shih, and in 1070 was compelled\r\nto resign. He devoted the rest of his life to the completion of his\r\nfamous work known as the _T‘ung Chien_ or Mirror of History, a title\r\nbestowed upon it in 1084 by the Emperor, because “to view antiquity as\r\nit were in a mirror is an aid in the administration of government.” The\r\nMirror of History covers a period from the fifth century B.C. down to\r\nthe beginning of the Sung dynasty, A.D. 960, and was supplemented by\r\nseveral important works from the author’s own hand, all bearing upon\r\nthe subject. In his youth the latter had been a devoted student, and\r\nused to rest his arm upon a kind of round wooden pillow, which roused\r\nhim to wakefulness by its movement every time he began to doze over\r\nhis work. On one occasion, in childhood, a small companion fell into a\r\nwater-kong, and would have been drowned but for the presence of mind of\r\nSsŭ-ma Kuang. He seized a huge stone, and with it cracked the jar so\r\nthat the water poured out. As a scholar he had a large library, and was\r\nso particular in the handling of his books that even after many years’\r\nuse they were still as good as new. He would not allow his disciples to\r\nturn over leaves by scratching them up with the nails, but made them\r\nuse the forefinger and second finger of the right hand. In 1085 he\r\ndetermined to return to public life, but he had not been many months\r\nin the capital, labouring as usual for his country’s good, before he\r\nsuccumbed to an illness and died, universally honoured and regretted\r\nby his countrymen, to whom he was affectionately known as the Living\r\nBuddha.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from his writings refers to a new and dangerous\r\ndevelopment in the Censorate, an institution which still plays a\r\nsingular part in the administration of China:--\r\n\r\n“Of old there was no such office as that of Censor. From the highest\r\nstatesman down to the artisan and trader, every man was free to\r\nadmonish the Throne. From the time of the Han dynasty onwards, this\r\nprerogative was vested in an office, with the weighty responsibility\r\nof discussing the government of the empire, the people within the Four\r\nSeas, successes, failures, advantages, and disadvantages, in order of\r\nimportance and of urgency. The sole object in this arrangement was\r\nthe benefit of the State, not that of the Censor, from whom all ideas\r\nof fame or gain were indeed far removed. In 1017 an edict was issued\r\nappointing six officers to undertake these Censorial duties, and in\r\n1045 their names were for the first time written out on boards; and\r\nthen, in 1062, apparently for better preservation, the names were cut\r\non stone. Thus posterity can point to such an one and say, ‘There was a\r\nloyal man;’ to another, ‘There was a traitor;’ to a third, ‘There was\r\nan upright man;’ to a fourth, ‘There was a scoundrel.’ Does not this\r\ngive cause for fear?”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHOU TUN-I]\r\n\r\nContemporaneously with Ssŭ-ma Kuang lived CHOU TUN-I (1017-1073), who\r\ncombined the duties of a small military command with prolonged and\r\narduous study. He made himself ill by overwork and strict attention\r\nto the interests of the people at all hazards to himself. His chief\r\nworks were written to elucidate the mysteries of the Book of Changes,\r\nand were published after his death by his disciples, with commentaries\r\nby Chu Hsi. The following short satire, veiled under the symbolism of\r\nflowers, being in a style which the educated Chinaman most appreciates,\r\nis very widely known:--\r\n\r\n“Lovers of flowering plants and shrubs we have had by scores, but T‘ao\r\nCh‘ien alone devoted himself to the chrysanthemum. Since the opening\r\ndays of the T‘ang dynasty, it has been fashionable to admire the peony;\r\nbut my favourite is the water-lily. How stainless it rises from its\r\nslimy bed! How modestly it reposes on the clear pool--an emblem of\r\npurity and truth! Symmetrically perfect, its subtle perfume is wafted\r\nfar and wide, while there it rests in spotless state, something to be\r\nregarded reverently from a distance, and not to be profaned by familiar\r\napproach.\r\n\r\n“In my opinion the chrysanthemum is the flower of retirement and\r\nculture; the peony the flower of rank and wealth; the water-lily, the\r\nLady Virtue _sans pareille_.\r\n\r\n“Alas! few have loved the chrysanthemum since T‘ao Ch‘ien, and none\r\nnow love the water-lily like myself, whereas the peony is a general\r\nfavourite with all mankind.”\r\n\r\nCH’ÊNG HAO (1032-1085) and CH’ÊNG I (1033-1107) were two brothers famed\r\nfor their scholarship, especially the younger of the two, who published\r\na valuable commentary upon the Book of Changes. The elder attracted\r\nsome attention by boldly suppressing a stone image in a Buddhist temple\r\nwhich was said to emit rays from its head, and had been the cause of\r\ndisorderly gatherings of men and women. A specimen of his verse will\r\nbe given in the next chapter. Ch‘êng I wrote some interesting chapters\r\non the art of poetry. In one of these he says, “Asked if a man can\r\nmake himself a poet by taking pains, I reply that only by taking pains\r\ncan any one hope to be ranked as such, though on the other hand the\r\nvery fact of taking pains is likely to be inimical to success. The old\r\ncouplet reminds us--\r\n\r\n  _‘E’er one pentameter be spoken\r\n  How many a human heart is broken!’_\r\n\r\nThere is also another old couplet--\r\n\r\n  _‘’Twere sad to take this heart of mine\r\n  And break it o’er a five-foot line.’_\r\n\r\nBoth of these are very much to the point. Confucius himself did not\r\nmake verses, but he did not advise others to abstain from doing so.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WANG AN-SHIH]\r\n\r\nThe great reformer and political economist WANG AN-SHIH\r\n(1021-1086), who lived to see all his policy reversed, was a hard\r\nworker as a youth, and in composition his pen was said to “fly over\r\nthe paper.” As a man he was distinguished by his frugality and his\r\nobstinacy. He wore dirty clothes and did not even wash his face, for\r\nwhich Su Hsün denounced him as a beast. He was so cocksure of all\r\nhis own views that he would never admit the possibility of being\r\nwrong, which gained for him the sobriquet of the Obstinate Minister.\r\nHe attempted to reform the examination system, requiring from the\r\ncandidate not so much graces of style as a wide acquaintance with\r\npractical subjects. “Accordingly,” says one Chinese writer, “even the\r\npupils at village schools threw away their text-books of rhetoric, and\r\nbegan to study primers of history, geography, and political economy.”\r\nHe was the author of a work on the written characters, with special\r\nreference to those which are formed by the combination of two or more,\r\nthe meanings of which, taken together, determine the meaning of the\r\ncompound character. The following is a letter which he wrote to a\r\nfriend on the study of false doctrines:--\r\n\r\n“I have been debarred by illness from writing to you now for some time,\r\nthough my thoughts have been with you all the while.\r\n\r\n“In reply to my last letter, wherein I expressed a fear that you were\r\nnot progressing with your study of the Canon, I have received several\r\nfrom you, in all of which you seem to think I meant the Canon of\r\nBuddha, and you are astonished at my recommendation of such pernicious\r\nworks. But how could I possibly have intended any other than the Canon\r\nof the sages of China? And for you to have thus missed the point of my\r\nletter is a good illustration of what I meant when I said I feared you\r\nwere not progressing with your study of the Canon.\r\n\r\n“Now a thorough knowledge of our Canon has not been attained by any one\r\nfor a very long period. Study of the Canon alone does not suffice for\r\na thorough knowledge of the Canon. Consequently, I have been myself an\r\nomnivorous reader of books of all kinds, even, for example, of ancient\r\nmedical and botanical works. I have, moreover, dipped into treatises\r\non agriculture and on needlework, all of which I have found very\r\nprofitable in aiding me to seize the great scheme of the Canon itself.\r\nFor learning in these days is a totally different pursuit from what it\r\nwas in the olden times; and it is now impossible otherwise to get at\r\nthe real meaning of our ancient sages.\r\n\r\n“There was Yang Hsiung. He hated all books that were not orthodox. Yet\r\nhe made a wide study of heterodox writers. By force of education he\r\nwas enabled to take what of good and to reject what of bad he found\r\nin each. Their pernicious influence was altogether lost on him; while\r\non the other hand he was prepared the more effectively to elucidate\r\nwhat we know to be the truth. Now, do you consider that I have been\r\ncorrupted by these pernicious influences? If so, you know me not.\r\n\r\n“No! the pernicious influences of the age are not to be sought for in\r\nthe Canon of Buddha. They are to be found in the corruption and vice of\r\nthose in high places; in the false and shameless conduct which is now\r\nrife among us. Do you not agree with me?”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SU SHIH]\r\n\r\nSU SHIH (1036-1101), better known by his fancy name as Su\r\nTung-p‘o, whose early education was superintended by his mother,\r\nproduced such excellent compositions at the examination for his final\r\ndegree that the examiner, Ou-yang Hsiu, suspected them to be the work\r\nof a qualified substitute. Ultimately he came out first on the list.\r\nHe rose to be a statesman, who made more enemies than friends, and\r\nwas perpetually struggling against the machinations of unscrupulous\r\nopponents, which on one occasion resulted in his banishment to the\r\nisland of Hainan, then a barbarous and almost unknown region. He was\r\nalso a brilliant essayist and poet, and his writings are still the\r\ndelight of the Chinese. The following is an account of a midnight\r\npicnic to a spot on the banks of a river at which a great battle had\r\ntaken place nearly nine hundred years before, and where one of the\r\nopposing fleets was burnt to the water’s edge, reddening a wall,\r\nprobably the cliff alongside:--\r\n\r\n“In the year 1081, the seventh moon just on the wane, I went with a\r\nfriend on a boat excursion to the Red Wall. A clear breeze was gently\r\nblowing, scarce enough to ruffle the river, as I filled my friend’s cup\r\nand bade him troll a lay to the bright moon, singing the song of the\r\n‘Modest Maid.’\r\n\r\n“By and by up rose the moon over the eastern hills, wandering between\r\nthe Wain and the Goat, shedding forth her silver beams, and linking the\r\nwater with the sky. On a skiff we took our seats, and shot over the\r\nliquid plain, lightly as though travelling through space, riding on\r\nthe wind without knowing whither we were bound. We seemed to be moving\r\nin another sphere, sailing through air like the gods. So I poured out\r\na bumper for joy, and, beating time on the skiff’s side, sang the\r\nfollowing verse:--\r\n\r\n  ‘_With laughing oars, our joyous prow\r\n    Shoots swiftly through the glittering wave--\r\n    My heart within grows sadly grave--\r\n  Great heroes dead, where are ye now?_’\r\n\r\n“My friend accompanied these words upon his flageolet, delicately\r\nadjusting its notes to express the varied emotions of pity and regret,\r\nwithout the slightest break in the thread of sound which seemed to wind\r\naround us like a silken skein. The very monsters of the deep yielded\r\nto the influence of his strains, while the boatwoman, who had lost her\r\nhusband, burst into a flood of tears. Overpowered by my own feelings,\r\nI settled myself into a serious mood, and asked my friend for some\r\nexplanation of his art. To this he replied, ‘Did not Ts‘ao Ts‘ao say--\r\n\r\n  ‘_The stars are few, the moon is bright,\r\n  The raven southward wings his flight?_’\r\n\r\n“‘Westwards to Hsia-k‘ou, eastwards to Wu-ch‘ang, where hill and\r\nstream in wild luxuriance blend,--was it not there that Ts‘ao Ts‘ao\r\nwas routed by Chou Yü? Ching-chou was at his feet: he was pushing down\r\nstream towards the east. His war-vessels stretched stem to stern for a\r\nthousand _li_: his banners darkened the sky. He poured out a libation\r\nas he neared Chiang-ling; and, sitting in the saddle armed _cap-à-pie_,\r\nhe uttered those words, did that hero of his age. Yet where is he\r\nto-day?\r\n\r\n“‘Now you and I have fished and gathered fuel together on the river\r\neyots. We have fraternised with the crayfish; we have made friends\r\nwith the deer. We have embarked together in our frail canoe; we have\r\ndrawn inspiration together from the wine-flask--a couple of ephemerides\r\nlaunched on the ocean in a rice-husk! Alas! life is but an instant of\r\nTime. I long to be like the Great River which rolls on its way without\r\nend. Ah, that I might cling to some angel’s wing and roam with him for\r\never! Ah, that I might clasp the bright moon in my arms and dwell with\r\nher for aye! Alas! it only remains to me to enwrap these regrets in the\r\ntender melody of sound.’\r\n\r\n“‘But do you forsooth comprehend,’ I inquired, ‘the mystery of this\r\nriver and of this moon? The water passes by but is never gone: the moon\r\nwanes only to wax once more. Relatively speaking, Time itself is but\r\nan instant of time; absolutely speaking, you and I, in common with all\r\nmatter, shall exist to all eternity. Wherefore, then, the longing of\r\nwhich you speak?\r\n\r\n“‘The objects we see around us are one and all the property of\r\nindividuals. If a thing does not belong to me, not a particle of it may\r\nbe enjoyed by me. But the clear breeze blowing across this stream, the\r\nbright moon streaming over yon hills,--these are sounds and sights to\r\nbe enjoyed without let or hindrance by all. They are the eternal gifts\r\nof God to all mankind, and their enjoyment is inexhaustible. Hence it\r\nis that you and I are enjoying them now.’\r\n\r\n“My friend smiled as he threw away the dregs from his wine-cup and\r\nfilled it once more to the brim. And then, when our feast was over,\r\namid the litter of cups and plates, we lay down to rest in the boat:\r\nfor streaks of light from the east had stolen upon us unawares.”\r\n\r\nThe completion of a pavilion which Su Shih had been building, “as a\r\nrefuge from the business of life,” coinciding with a fall of rain which\r\nput an end to a severe drought, elicited a grateful record of this\r\ndivine manifestation towards a suffering people. “The pavilion was\r\nnamed after rain, to commemorate joy.” His record concludes with these\r\nlines:--\r\n\r\n  “_Should Heaven rain pearls, the cold cannot wear them as clothes;\r\n  Should Heaven rain jade, the hungry cannot use it as food.\r\n      It has rained without cease for three days--\r\n      Whose was the influence at work?\r\n  Should you say it was that of your Governor,\r\n  The Governor himself refers it to the Son of Heaven.\r\n  But the Son of Heaven says ‘No! it was God.\r\n  And God says ‘No! it was Nature.’\r\n      And as Nature lies beyond the ken of man,\r\n      I christen this arbour instead._”\r\n\r\nAnother piece refers to a recluse who--\r\n\r\n“Kept a couple of cranes, which he had carefully trained; and every\r\nmorning he would release them westwards through the gap, to fly away\r\nand alight in the marsh below or soar aloft among the clouds as the\r\nbirds’ own fancy might direct. At nightfall they would return with the\r\nutmost regularity.”\r\n\r\nThis piece is also finished off with a few poetical lines:--\r\n\r\n  “_Away! away! my birds, fly westwards now,\r\n  To wheel on high and gaze on all below;\r\n  To swoop together, pinions closed, to earth;\r\n  To soar aloft once more among the clouds;\r\n  To wander all day long in sedgy vale;\r\n  To gather duckweed in the stony marsh.\r\n  Come back! come back! beneath the lengthening shades,\r\n  Your serge-clad master stands, guitar in hand.\r\n  ’Tis he that feeds you from his slender store:\r\n  Come back! come back! nor linger in the west._”\r\n\r\nHis account of Sleep-Land is based upon the Drunk-Land of Wang Chi:--\r\n\r\n“A pure administration and admirable morals prevail there, the whole\r\nbeing one vast level tract, with no north, south, east, or west. The\r\ninhabitants are quiet and affable; they suffer from no diseases of\r\nany kind, neither are they subject to the influences of the seven\r\npassions. They have no concern with the ordinary affairs of life; they\r\ndo not distinguish heaven, earth, the sun, and the moon; they toil not,\r\nneither do they spin; but simply lie down and enjoy themselves. They\r\nhave no ships and no carriages; their wanderings, however, are the\r\nboundless flights of the imagination.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHis younger brother, SU CHÊ (1039-1112), poet and official, is\r\nchiefly known for his devotion to Taoism. He published an edition, with\r\ncommentary, of the _Tao-Tê-Ching_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HUANG T‘ING-CHIEN]\r\n\r\nOne of the Four Scholars of his century is HUANG T‘ING-CHIEN\r\n(1050-1110), who was distinguished as a poet and a calligraphist. He\r\nhas also been placed among the twenty-four examples of filial piety,\r\nfor when his mother was ill he watched by her bedside for a whole year\r\nwithout ever taking off his clothes. The following is a specimen of his\r\nepistolary style:--\r\n\r\n“Hsi K‘ang’s verses are at once vigorous and purely beautiful, without\r\na vestige of commonplace about them. Every student of the poetic art\r\nshould know them thoroughly, and thus bring the author into his mind’s\r\neye.\r\n\r\n“Those who are sunk in the cares and anxieties of this world’s strife,\r\neven by a passing glance would gain therefrom enough to clear away some\r\npecks of the cobwebs of mortality. How much more they who penetrate\r\nfurther and seize each hidden meaning and enjoy its flavour to the\r\nfull? Therefore, my nephew, I send you these poems for family reading,\r\nthat you may cleanse your heart and solace a weary hour by their\r\nperusal.\r\n\r\n“As I recently observed to my own young people, the true hero should be\r\nmany-sided, but he must not be commonplace. It is impossible to cure\r\nthat. Upon which one of them asked by what characteristics this absence\r\nof the commonplace was distinguished. ‘It is hard to say,’ I replied.\r\n‘A man who is not commonplace is, under ordinary circumstances, much\r\nlike other people. But he who at moments of great trial does not\r\nflinch, he is not commonplace.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCHÊNG CH’IAO (1108-1166) began his literary career in studious\r\nseclusion, cut off from all human intercourse. Then he spent some\r\ntime in visiting various places of interest, devoting himself to\r\nsearching out marvels, investigating antiquities, and reading (and\r\nremembering) every book that came in his way. In 1149 he was summoned\r\nto an audience, and received an honorary post. He was then sent home\r\nto copy out his History of China, which covered a period from about\r\nB.C. 2800 to A.D. 600. A fine edition of this work, in forty-six large\r\nvolumes, was published in 1749 by Imperial command, with a preface by\r\nthe Emperor Ch‘ien Lung. He also wrote essays and poetry, besides a\r\ntreatise in which he showed that the inscriptions on the Stone Drums,\r\nnow in Peking, belong rather to the latter half of the third century\r\nB.C. than to the tenth or eleventh century B.C., as usually accepted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHU HSI]\r\n\r\nThe name of CHU HSI (1130-1200) is a household word throughout\r\nthe length and breadth of literary China. He graduated at nineteen, and\r\nentered upon a highly successful official career. He apparently had a\r\nstrong leaning towards Buddhism--some say that he actually became a\r\nBuddhist priest; at any rate, he soon saw the error of his ways, and\r\ngave himself up completely to a study of the orthodox doctrine. He was\r\na most voluminous writer. In addition to his revision of the history\r\nof Ssŭ-ma Kuang, which, under the title of _T‘ung Chien Kang Mu_, is\r\nstill regarded as the standard history of China, he placed himself\r\nfirst in the first rank of all commentators on the Confucian Canon. He\r\nintroduced interpretations either wholly or partly at variance with\r\nthose which had been put forth by the scholars of the Han dynasty and\r\nhitherto received as infallible, thus modifying to a certain extent the\r\nprevailing standard of political and social morality. His principle\r\nwas simply one of consistency. He refused to interpret words in a\r\ngiven passage in one sense, and the same words occurring elsewhere in\r\nanother sense. The result, as a whole, was undoubtedly to quicken with\r\nintelligibility many paragraphs the meaning of which had been obscured\r\nrather than elucidated by the earlier scholars of the Han dynasty.\r\nOccasionally, however, the great commentator o’erleapt himself. Here\r\nare two versions of one passage in the Analects, as interpreted by\r\nthe rival schools, of which the older seems unquestionably to be\r\npreferred:--\r\n\r\n    _Han._\r\n\r\n    Mêng Wu asked Confucius concerning filial piety. The Master said,\r\n    “It consists in giving your parents no cause for anxiety save from\r\n    your natural ailments.”\r\n\r\n    _Chu Hsi._\r\n\r\n    Mêng Wu asked Confucius concerning filial piety. The Master\r\n    said, “Parents have the sorrow of thinking anxiously about their\r\n    children’s ailments.”\r\n\r\nThe latter of these interpretations being obviously incomplete, Chu Hsi\r\nadds a gloss to the effect that children are therefore in duty bound to\r\ntake great care of themselves.\r\n\r\nIn the preface to his work on the Four Books as explained by Chu\r\nHsi, published in 1745, Wang Pu-ch‘ing (born 1671) has the following\r\npassage:--“Shao Yung tried to explain the Canon of Changes by numbers,\r\nand Ch‘êng I by the eternal fitness of things; but Chu Hsi alone\r\nwas able to pierce through the meaning, and appropriate the thought\r\nof the prophets who composed it.” The other best known works of Chu\r\nHsi are a metaphysical treatise containing the essence of his later\r\nspeculations, and the Little Learning, a handbook for the young. It has\r\nbeen contended by some that the word “little” in the last title refers\r\nnot to youthful learners, but to the lower plane on which the book is\r\nwritten, as compared with the Great Learning. The following extract,\r\nhowever, seems to point more towards Learning for the Young as the\r\ncorrect rendering of the title:--\r\n\r\n“When mounting the wall of a city, do not point with the finger; when\r\non the top, do not call out.\r\n\r\n“When at a friend’s house, do not persist in asking for anything you\r\nmay wish to have. When going upstairs, utter a loud ‘Ahem!’ If you\r\nsee two pairs of shoes outside and hear voices, you may go in; but\r\nif you hear nothing, remain outside. Do not trample on the shoes of\r\nother guests, nor step on the mat spread for food; but pick up your\r\nskirts and pass quickly to your allotted place. Do not be in a hurry to\r\narrive, nor in haste to get away.\r\n\r\n“Do not bother the gods with too many prayers. Do not make allowances\r\nfor your own shortcomings. Do not seek to know what has not yet come to\r\npass.”\r\n\r\nChu Hsi was lucky enough to fall in with a clever portrait painter,\r\na _rara avis_ in China at the present day according to Mr. J. B.\r\nCoughtrie, late of Hongkong, who declares that “the style and taste\r\npeculiar to the Chinese combine to render a lifelike resemblance\r\nimpossible, and the completed picture unattractive. The artist lays\r\nupon his paper a flat wash of colour to match the complexion of his\r\nsitter, and upon this draws a mere map of the features, making no\r\nattempt to obtain roundness or relief by depicting light and shadows,\r\nand never by any chance conveying the slightest suggestion of animation\r\nor expression.” Chu Hsi gave the artist a glowing testimonial, in\r\nwhich he states that the latter not merely portrays the features, but\r\n“catches the very expression, and reproduces, as it were, the inmost\r\nmind of his model.” He then adds the following personal tit-bit:--\r\n\r\n“I myself sat for two portraits, one large and the other small; and it\r\nwas quite a joke to see how accurately he reproduced my coarse ugly\r\nface and my vulgar rustic turn of mind, so that even those who had only\r\nheard of, but had never seen me, knew at once for whom the portraits\r\nwere intended.” It would be interesting to know if either of these\r\npictures still survives among the Chu family heirlooms.\r\n\r\nAt the death of Chu Hsi, his coffin is said to have taken up a\r\nposition, suspended in the air, about three feet from the ground.\r\nWhereupon his son-in-law, falling on his knees beside the bier,\r\nreminded the departed spirit of the great principles of which he had\r\nbeen such a brilliant exponent in life,--and the coffin descended\r\ngently to the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nPOETRY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe poetry of the Sungs has not attracted so much attention as that\r\nof the T‘angs. This is chiefly due to the fact that although all\r\nthe literary men of the Sung dynasty may roughly be said to have\r\ncontributed their quota of verse, still there were few, if any, who\r\ncould be ranked as professional poets, that is, as writers of verse\r\nand of nothing else, like Li Po, Tu Fu, and many others under the\r\nT‘ang dynasty. Poetry now began to be, what it has remained in a\r\nmarked degree until the present day, a department of polite education,\r\nirrespective of the particle of the divine gale. More regard was paid\r\nto form, and the license which had been accorded to earlier masters was\r\nsacrificed to conventionality. The Odes collected by Confucius are, as\r\nwe have seen, rude ballads of love, and war, and tilth, borne by their\r\nvery simplicity direct to the human heart. The poetry of the T‘ang\r\ndynasty shows a masterly combination, in which art, unseen, is employed\r\nto enhance, not to fetter and degrade, thoughts drawn from a veritable\r\ncommunion with nature. With the fall of the T‘ang dynasty the poetic\r\nart suffered a lapse from which it has never recovered; and now, in\r\nmodern times, although every student “can turn a verse” because he has\r\nbeen “duly taught,” the poems produced disclose a naked artificiality\r\nwhich leaves the reader disappointed and cold.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CH’ÊN T‘UAN]\r\n\r\nThe poet CH’ÊN T‘UAN (_d._ A.D. 989) began life under favourable\r\nauspices. He was suckled by a mysterious lady in a green robe, who\r\nfound him playing as a tiny child on the bank of a river. He became, in\r\nconsequence of this supernatural nourishment, exceedingly clever and\r\npossessed of a prodigious memory, with a happy knack for verse. Yet he\r\nfailed to get a degree, and gave himself up “to the joys of hill and\r\nstream.” While on the mountains some spiritual beings are said to have\r\ntaught him the art of hibernating like an animal, so that he would go\r\noff to sleep for a hundred days at a time. He wrote a treatise on the\r\nelixir of life, and was generally inclined to Taoist notions. At death\r\nhis body remained warm for seven days, and for a whole month a “glory”\r\nplayed around his tomb. He was summoned several times to Court, but to\r\njudge by the following poem, officialdom seems to have had few charms\r\nfor him:--\r\n\r\n  “_For ten long years I plodded through\r\n            the vale of lust and strife,\r\n  Then through my dreams there flashed a ray\r\n            of the old sweet peaceful life....\r\n  No scarlet-tasselled hat of state\r\n            can vie with soft repose;\r\n  Grand mansions do not taste the joys\r\n            that the poor man’s cabin knows.\r\n  I hate the threatening clash of arms\r\n            when fierce retainers throng,\r\n  I loathe the drunkard’s revels and\r\n            the sound of fife and song;\r\n  But I love to seek a quiet nook, and\r\n            some old volume bring\r\n  Where I can see the wild flowers bloom\r\n            and hear the birds in spring._”\r\n\r\nAnother poet, YANG I (974-1030), was unable to speak as a child, until\r\none day, being taken to the top of a pagoda, he suddenly burst out with\r\nthe following lines:--\r\n\r\n  “_Upon this tall pagoda’s peak\r\n    My hand can nigh the stars enclose;\r\n  I dare not raise my voice to speak,\r\n    For fear of startling God’s repose._”\r\n\r\nMention has already been made of SHAO YUNG (1011-1077) in\r\nconnection with Chu Hsi and classical scholarship. He was a great\r\ntraveller, and an enthusiast in the cause of learning. He denied\r\nhimself a stove in winter and a fan in summer. For thirty years he did\r\nnot use a pillow, nor had he even a mat to sleep on. The following\r\nspecimen of his verse seems, however, to belie his character as an\r\nascetic:--\r\n\r\n  “_Fair flowers from above in my goblet are shining,\r\n  And add by reflection an infinite zest;\r\n  Through two generations I’ve lived unrepining,\r\n  While four mighty rulers have sunk to their rest._\r\n\r\n  “_My body in health has done nothing to spite me,\r\n  And sweet are the moments which pass o’er my head;\r\n  But now, with this wine and these flowers to delight me,\r\n  How shall I keep sober and get home to bed?_”\r\n\r\nShao Yung was a great authority on natural phenomena, the explanation\r\nof which he deduced from principles found in the Book of Changes. On\r\none occasion he was strolling about with some friends when he heard\r\nthe goatsucker’s cry. He immediately became depressed, and said, “When\r\ngood government is about to prevail, the magnetic current flows from\r\nnorth to south; when bad government is about to prevail, it flows from\r\nsouth to north, and birds feel its influence first of all things. Now\r\nhitherto this bird has not been seen at Lo-yang; from which I infer\r\nthat the magnetic current is flowing from south to north, and that some\r\nsoutherner is coming into power, with manifold consequences to the\r\nState.” The subsequent appearance of Wang An-shih was regarded as a\r\nverification of his skill.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WANG AN-SHIH]\r\n\r\nThe great reformer here mentioned found time, amid the cares of his\r\neconomic revolution, to indulge in poetical composition. Here is his\r\naccount of a _nuit blanche_, an excellent example of the difficult\r\n“stop-short:”--\r\n\r\n  “_The incense-stick is burnt to ash,\r\n            the water-clock is stilled.\r\n  The midnight breeze blows sharply by,\r\n            and all around is chilled._\r\n\r\n  “_Yet I am kept from slumber\r\n            by the beauty of the spring...\r\n  Sweet shapes of flowers across the blind\r\n            the quivering moonbeams fling!_”\r\n\r\nHere, too, is a short poem by the classical scholar, Huang T‘ing-chien,\r\nwritten on the annual visit for worship at the tombs of ancestors, in\r\nfull view of the hillside cemetery:--\r\n\r\n  “_The peach and plum trees smile with flowers\r\n          this famous day of spring,\r\n  And country graveyards round about\r\n          with lamentations ring.\r\n  Thunder has startled insect life\r\n          and roused the gnats and bees,\r\n  A gentle rain has urged the crops\r\n          and soothed the flowers and trees....\r\n  Perhaps on this side lie the bones\r\n          of a wretch whom no one knows;\r\n  On that, the sacred ashes\r\n          of a patriot repose.\r\n  But who across the centuries\r\n          can hope to mark each spot\r\n  Where fool and hero, joined in death,\r\n          beneath the brambles rot?_”\r\n\r\nThe grave student Ch‘êng Hao wrote verses like the rest. Sometimes he\r\neven condescended to jest:--\r\n\r\n  “_I wander north, I wander south,\r\n          I rest me where I please....\r\n  See how the river-banks are nipped\r\n          beneath the autumn breeze!\r\n  Yet what care I if autumn blasts\r\n          the river-banks lay bare?\r\n  The loss of hue to river-banks\r\n          is the river-banks’ affair._”\r\n\r\nIn the eleventh and twelfth centuries HUNG CHÜEH-FAN made a\r\nname for himself as a poet and calligraphist, but he finally yielded\r\nto the fascination of Buddhism and took orders as a priest. This is\r\nno trifling ordeal. From three to nine pastilles are placed upon the\r\nshaven scalp of the candidate, and are allowed to burn down into the\r\nflesh, leaving an indelible scar. Here is a poem by him, written\r\nprobably before monasticism had damped his natural ardour:--\r\n\r\n  “_Two green silk ropes, with painted stand,\r\n          from heights aërial swing,\r\n  And there outside the house a maid\r\n          disports herself in spring.\r\n  Along the ground her blood-red skirts\r\n          all swiftly swishing fly,\r\n  As though to bear her off to be\r\n          an angel in the sky.\r\n  Strewed thick with fluttering almond-blooms\r\n          the painted stand is seen;\r\n  The embroidered ropes flit to and fro\r\n          amid the willow green.\r\n  Then when she stops and out she springs\r\n          to stand with downcast eyes,\r\n  You think she is some angel\r\n          just now banished from the skies._”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: YEH SHIH--KAO CHÜ-NIEN]\r\n\r\nBetter known as a statesman than as a poet is YEH SHIH\r\n(1150-1223). The following “stop-short,” however, referring to the\r\nentrance-gate to a beautiful park, is ranked among the best of its\r\nkind:--\r\n\r\n  “_’Tis closed!--lest trampling footsteps mar\r\n          the glory of the green.\r\n  Time after time we knock and knock;\r\n          no janitor is seen.\r\n  Yet bolts and bars can’t quite shut in\r\n          the spring-time’s beauteous pall:\r\n  A pink-flowered almond-spray peeps out\r\n          athwart the envious wall!_”\r\n\r\nOf KAO CHÜ-NIEN nothing seems to be known. His poem on the\r\nannual spring worship at the tombs of ancestors is to be found in all\r\ncollections:--\r\n\r\n  “_The northern and the southern hills\r\n          are one large burying-ground,\r\n  And all is life and bustle there\r\n          when the sacred day comes round.\r\n  Burnt paper ~cash~, like butterflies,\r\n          fly fluttering far and wide,\r\n  While mourners’ robes with tears of blood\r\n          a crimson hue are dyed.\r\n  The sun sets, and the red fox crouches\r\n          down beside the tomb;\r\n  Night comes, and youths and maidens laugh\r\n          where lamps light up the gloom.\r\n  Let him whose fortune brings him wine,\r\n          get tipsy while he may,\r\n  For no man, when the long night comes,\r\n          can take one drop away!_”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nDICTIONARIES--ENCYCLOPÆDIAS--MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral dictionaries of importance were issued by various scholars\r\nduring the Sung dynasty, not to mention many philological works of\r\nmore or less value. The Chinese have always been students of their\r\nown language, partly, no doubt, because they have so far never\r\ncondescended to look at any other. They delight in going back to days\r\nwhen correspondence was carried on by pictures pure and simple; and the\r\nfact that there is little evidence forthcoming that such a system ever\r\nprevailed has only resulted in stimulating invention and forgery.\r\n\r\nA clever courtier, popularly known as “the nine-tailed fox,” was CH’ÊN\r\nP‘ÊNG-NIEN (A.D. 961--1017), who rose to be a Minister of State. He\r\nwas employed to revise the _Kuang Yün_, a phonetic dictionary by some\r\nunknown author, which contained over 26,000 separate characters. This\r\nwork was to a great extent superseded by the _Chi Yün_, on a similar\r\nplan, but containing over 53,000 characters. The latter was produced by\r\nSung Ch‘i, mentioned in chap. iii., in conjunction with several eminent\r\nscholars.\r\n\r\nTAI T‘UNG graduated in 1237 and rose to be Governor of\r\nT‘ai-chou in Chehkiang. Then the Mongols prevailed, and Tai T‘ung,\r\nunwilling to serve them, pleaded ill-health, and in 1275 retired\r\ninto private life. There he occupied himself with the composition of\r\nthe _Liu Shu Ku_ or Six Scripts, an examination into the origin and\r\ndevelopment of writing, which, according to some, was published about\r\nA.D. 1250, but according to others, not until so late as the\r\nyear 1319.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WU SHU--LI FANG]\r\n\r\nFrom the rise of the Sung dynasty may be dated the first appearance of\r\nthe encyclopædia, destined to occupy later so much space in Chinese\r\nliterature. WU SHU (A.D. 947--1002), whose life was a good instance\r\nof “worth by poverty depressed,” may fairly be credited with the\r\nproduction of the earliest work of the kind. His _Shih Lei Fu_ dealt\r\nwith celestial and terrestrial phenomena, mineralogy, botany, and\r\nnatural history, arranged, for want of an alphabet, under categories.\r\nIt is curiously written in the poetical-prose style, and forms the\r\nfoundation of a similar book of reference in use at the present day.\r\nWu Shu was placed upon the commission which produced a much more\r\nextensive work known as the _T‘ai P‘ing Yü Lan_. At the head of that\r\ncommission was LI FANG (A.D. 924--995), a Minister of State and a great\r\nfavourite with the Emperor. In the last year of his life he was invited\r\nto witness the Feast of Lanterns from the palace. On that occasion the\r\nEmperor placed Li beside him, and after pouring out for him a goblet\r\nof wine and supplying him with various delicacies, he turned to his\r\ncourtiers and said, “Li Fang has twice served us as Minister of State,\r\nyet has he never in any way injured a single fellow-creature. Truly\r\nthis must be a virtuous man.” The _T‘ai P‘ing Yü Lan_ was reprinted\r\nin 1812, and is bound up in thirty-two large volumes. It was so\r\nnamed because the Emperor himself went through all the manuscript, a\r\ntask which occupied him nearly a year. A list of about eight hundred\r\nauthorities is given, and the Index fills four hundred pages.\r\n\r\nAs a pendant to this work Li Fang designed the _T‘ai P‘ing Kuang Chi_,\r\nan encyclopædia of biographical and other information drawn from\r\ngeneral literature. A list of about three hundred and sixty authorities\r\nis given, and the Index fills two hundred and eighty pages. The edition\r\nof 1566--a rare work--bound up in twelve thick volumes, stands upon the\r\nshelves of the Cambridge University Library.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother encyclopædist was MA TUAN-LIN, the son of a high\r\nofficial, in whose steps he prepared to follow. The dates of his birth\r\nand death are not known, but he flourished in the thirteenth century.\r\nUpon the collapse of the Sung dynasty he disappeared from public life,\r\nand taking refuge in his native place, he gave himself up to teaching,\r\nattracting many disciples from far and near, and fascinating all by\r\nhis untiring dialectic skill. He left behind him the _Wên Hsien T‘ung\r\nK‘ao_, a large encyclopædia based upon the _T‘ung Tien_ of Tu Yu, but\r\nmuch enlarged and supplemented by five additional sections, namely,\r\nBibliography, Imperial Lineage, Appointments, Uranography, and Natural\r\nPhenomena. This work, which cost its author twenty years of unremitting\r\nlabour, has long been known to Europeans, who have drawn largely upon\r\nits ample stores of antiquarian research.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE HSI YÜAN LU]\r\n\r\nAt the close of the Sung dynasty there was published a curious book on\r\nMedical Jurisprudence, which is interesting, in spite of its manifold\r\nabsurdities, as being the recognised handbook for official use at the\r\npresent day. No magistrate ever thinks of proceeding to discharge\r\nthe duties of coroner without taking a copy of these instructions\r\nalong with him. The present work was compiled by a judge named Sung\r\nTz’ŭ, from pre-existing works of a similar kind, and we are told in\r\nthe preface of a fine edition, dated 1842, that “being subjected for\r\nmany generations to practical tests by the officers of the Board of\r\nPunishments, it became daily more and more exact.” A few extracts will\r\nbe sufficient to determine its real value:--\r\n\r\n(1.) “Man has three hundred and sixty-five bones, corresponding to the\r\nnumber of days it takes the heavens to revolve.\r\n\r\n“The skull of a male, from the nape of the neck to the top of the\r\nhead, consists of eight pieces--of a Ts‘ai-chou man, nine. There is a\r\nhorizontal suture across the back of the skull, and a perpendicular\r\none down the middle. Female skulls are of six pieces, and have the\r\nhorizontal but not the perpendicular suture.\r\n\r\n“Teeth are twenty-four, twenty-eight, thirty-two, or thirty-six in\r\nnumber. There are three long-shaped breast-bones.\r\n\r\n“There is one bone belonging to the heart of the shape and size of a\r\n_cash_.\r\n\r\n“There is one ‘shoulder-well’ bone and one ‘rice-spoon’ bone on each\r\nside.\r\n\r\n“Males have twelve ribs on each side, eight long and four short.\r\nFemales have fourteen on each side.”\r\n\r\n(2.) “Wounds inflicted on the bone leave a red mark and a slight\r\nappearance of saturation, and where the bone is broken there will be\r\nat each end a halo-like trace of blood. Take a bone on which there\r\nare marks of a wound, and hold it up to the light; if these are of a\r\nfresh-looking red, the wound was inflicted before death and penetrated\r\nto the bone; but if there is no trace of saturation from blood,\r\nalthough there is a wound, it was inflicted after death.”\r\n\r\n(3.) “The bones of parents may be identified by their children in the\r\nfollowing manner. Let the experimenter cut himself or herself with\r\na knife, and cause the blood to drip on to the bones; then if the\r\nrelationship is an actual fact, the blood will sink into the bone,\r\notherwise it will not. _N.B._--Should the bones have been washed with\r\nsalt water, even though the relationship exists, yet the blood will not\r\nsoak in. This is a trick to be guarded against beforehand.\r\n\r\n“It is also said that if parent and child, or husband and wife, each\r\ncut themselves and let the blood drip into a basin of water, the two\r\nbloods will mix, whereas that of two people not thus related will not\r\nmix.\r\n\r\n“Where two brothers, who may have been separated since childhood, are\r\ndesirous of establishing their identity as such, but are unable to\r\ndo so by ordinary means, bid each one cut himself and let the blood\r\ndrip into a basin. If they are really brothers, the two bloods will\r\ncoagulate into one; otherwise not. But because fresh blood will always\r\ncoagulate with the aid of a little salt or vinegar, people often smear\r\nthe basin over with these to attain their own ends and deceive others;\r\ntherefore always wash out the basin you are going to use, or buy a new\r\none from a shop. Thus the trick will be defeated.”\r\n\r\n(4.) “There are some atrocious villains who, when they have murdered\r\nany one, burn the body and throw the ashes away, so that there are no\r\nbones to examine. In such cases you must carefully find out at what\r\ntime the murder was committed, and where the body was burnt. Then,\r\nwhen you know the place, all witnesses agreeing on this point, you\r\nmay proceed without further delay to examine the wounds. The mode of\r\nprocedure is this. Put up your shed near where the body was burnt, and\r\nmake the accused and witnesses point out themselves the exact spot.\r\nThen cut down the grass and weeds growing on this spot, and burn large\r\nquantities of fuel till the place is extremely hot, throwing on several\r\npecks of hemp-seed. By and by brush the place clean; then, if the body\r\nwas actually burnt on this spot, the oil from the seed will be found to\r\nhave sunk into the ground in the form of a human figure, and wherever\r\nthere were wounds on the dead man, there on this figure the oil will be\r\nfound to have collected together, large or small, square, round, long,\r\nshort, oblique, or straight, exactly as they were inflicted. The parts\r\nwhere there were no wounds will be free from any such appearances.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE SIXTH\r\n\r\n_THE MONGOL DYNASTY_ (A.D. 1200-1368)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS LITERATURE--POETRY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thirteenth and fourteenth centuries witnessed a remarkable\r\npolitical revolution. China was conquered by the Mongols, and for the\r\nfirst time in history the empire passed under the rule of an alien\r\nsovereign. No exact date can be assigned for the transference of the\r\nImperial power. In 1264 Kublai Khan fixed his capital at Peking, and in\r\n1271 he adopted Yüan as his dynastic style. It was not, however, until\r\n1279 that the patriot statesman, Chao Ping, had his retreat cut off,\r\nand despairing of his country, took upon his back the boy-Emperor, the\r\nlast of the Sungs, and jumped from his doomed vessel into the river,\r\nthus bringing the great fire-led dynasty to an end.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WÊN T‘IEN-HSIANG]\r\n\r\nKublai Khan, who was a confirmed Buddhist, paid great honour to\r\nConfucius, and was a steady patron of literature. In 1269 he caused\r\nBashpa, a Tibetan priest, to construct an alphabet for the Mongol\r\nlanguage; in 1280 the calendar was revised; and in 1287 the Imperial\r\nAcademy was opened. But he could not forgive WÊN T‘IEN-HSIANG\r\n(1236-1283), the renowned patriot and scholar, who had fought so\r\nbravely but unsuccessfully against him. In 1279 the latter was conveyed\r\nto Peking, on which journey he passed eight days without eating.\r\nEvery effort was made to induce him to own allegiance to the Mongol\r\nEmperor, but without success. He was kept in prison for three years.\r\nAt length he was summoned into the presence of Kublai Khan, who said\r\nto him, “What is it you want?” “By the grace of the Sung Emperor,” Wên\r\nT‘ien-hsiang replied, “I became his Majesty’s Minister. I cannot serve\r\ntwo masters. I only ask to die.” Accordingly he was executed, meeting\r\nhis death with composure, and making a final obeisance southwards, as\r\nthough his own sovereign was still reigning in his own capital. The\r\nfollowing poem was written by Wên T‘ien-hsiang while in captivity:--\r\n\r\n“There is in the universe an Aura which permeates all things and makes\r\nthem what they are. Below, it shapes forth land and water; above, the\r\nsun and the stars. In man it is called spirit; and there is nowhere\r\nwhere it is not.\r\n\r\n“In times of national tranquillity this spirit lies _perdu_ in the\r\nharmony which prevails; only at some great crisis is it manifested\r\nwidely abroad.”\r\n\r\n[Here follow ten historical instances of devotion and heroism.]\r\n\r\n“Such is this grand and glorious spirit which endureth for all\r\ngenerations, and which, linked with the sun and the moon, knows neither\r\nbeginning nor end. The foundation of all that is great and good in\r\nheaven and earth, it is itself born from the everlasting obligations\r\nwhich are due by man to man.\r\n\r\n“Alas! the fates were against me. I was without resource. Bound with\r\nfetters, hurried away towards the north, death would have been sweet\r\nindeed; but that boon was refused.\r\n\r\n“My dungeon is lighted by the will-o’-the-wisp alone; no breath of\r\nspring cheers the murky solitude in which I dwell. The ox and the barb\r\nherd together in one stall, the rooster and the phœnix feed together\r\nfrom one dish. Exposed to mist and dew, I had many times thought to\r\ndie; and yet, through the seasons of two revolving years, disease\r\nhovered round me in vain. The dank, unhealthy soil to me became\r\nparadise itself. For there was that within me which misfortune could\r\nnot steal away. And so I remained firm, gazing at the white clouds\r\nfloating over my head, and bearing in my heart a sorrow boundless as\r\nthe sky.\r\n\r\n“The sun of those dead heroes has long since set, but their record is\r\nbefore me still. And, while the wind whistles under the eaves, I open\r\nmy books and read; and lo! in their presence my heart glows with a\r\nborrowed fire.”\r\n\r\n“I myself,” adds the famous commentator, Lin Hsi-chung, of the\r\nseventeenth century, “in consequence of the rebellion in Fuhkien, lay\r\nin prison for two years, while deadly disease raged around. Daily I\r\nrecited this poem several times over, and happily escaped; from which\r\nit is clear that the supremest efforts in literature move even the\r\ngods, and that it is not the verses of Tu Fu alone which can prevail\r\nagainst malarial fever.”\r\n\r\nAt the final examination for his degree in 1256, Wên T‘ien-hsiang had\r\nbeen placed seventh on the list. However, the then Emperor, on looking\r\nover the papers of the candidates before the result was announced,\r\nwas immensely struck by his work, and sent for the grand examiner\r\nto reconsider the order of merit. “This essay,” said his Majesty,\r\n“shows us the moral code of the ancients as in a mirror; it betokens\r\na loyalty enduring as iron and stone.” The grand examiner readily\r\nadmitted the justice of the Emperor’s criticism, and when the list\r\nwas published, the name of Wên T‘ien-hsiang stood first. The fame of\r\nthat examiner, WANG YING-LIN (1223-1296), is likely to last\r\nfor a long time to come. Not because of his association with one of\r\nChina’s greatest patriots, nor because of his voluminous contributions\r\nto classical literature, including an extensive encyclopædia, a rare\r\ncopy of which is to be seen in the University of Leyden, but because\r\nof a small primer for schoolboys, which, by almost universal consent,\r\nis attributed to his pen. For six hundred years this primer has been,\r\nand is still at this moment, the first book put into the hand of every\r\nchild throughout the empire. It is an epitome of all knowledge, dealing\r\nwith philosophy, classical literature, history, biography, and common\r\nobjects. It has been called a sleeve edition of the Mirror of History.\r\nWritten in lines of three characters to each, and being in doggerel\r\nrhyme, it is easily committed to memory, and is known by heart by every\r\nChinaman who has learnt to read. This Three Character Classic, as it\r\nis called, has been imitated by Christian missionaries, Protestant and\r\nCatholic; and even the T‘ai-p‘ing rebels, alive to its far-reaching\r\ninfluence, published an imitation of their own. Here are a few specimen\r\nlines, rhymed to match the original:--\r\n\r\n  “_Men, one and all, in infancy\r\n  Are virtuous at heart;\r\n  Their moral tendencies the same,\r\n  Their practice wide apart.\r\n  Without instruction’s kindly aid\r\n  Man’s nature grows less fair;\r\n  In teaching, thoroughness should be\r\n  A never-ceasing care._”\r\n\r\nIt may be added that the meaning of the Three Character Classic is not\r\nexplained to the child at the time. All that the latter has to do is to\r\nlearn the sounds and formation of the 560 different characters of which\r\nthe book is composed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LIU YIN]\r\n\r\nA clever boy, who attracted much attention by the filial piety which\r\nhe displayed towards his stepfather, was LIU YIN (1241-1293).\r\nHe obtained office, but resigned in order to tend his sick mother; and\r\nwhen again appointed, his health broke down and he went into seclusion.\r\nThe following extract is from his pen:--\r\n\r\n“When God made man, He gave him powers to cope with the exigencies of\r\nhis environment, and resources within himself, so that he need not be\r\ndependent upon external circumstances.\r\n\r\n“Thus, in districts where poisons abound, antidotes abound also; and\r\nin others, where malaria prevails, we find such correctives as ginger,\r\nnutmegs, and dogwood. Again, fish, terrapins, and clams are the most\r\nwholesome articles of diet in excessively damp climates, though\r\nthemselves denizens of the water; and musk and deer-horns are excellent\r\nprophylactics in earthy climates, where in fact they are produced. For\r\nif these things were unable to prevail against their surroundings, they\r\ncould not possibly thrive where they do, while the fact that they do so\r\nthrive is proof positive that they were ordained as specifics against\r\nthose surroundings.\r\n\r\n“Chu Hsi said, ‘When God is about to send down calamities upon us, He\r\nfirst raises up the hero whose genius shall finally prevail against\r\nthose calamities.’ From this point of view there can be no living man\r\nwithout his appointed use, nor any state of society which man should be\r\nunable to put right.”\r\n\r\nThe theory that every man plays his allotted part in the cosmos is a\r\nfavourite one with the Chinese; and the process by which the tares are\r\nseparated from the wheat, exemplifying the use of adversity, has been\r\ncuriously stated by a Buddhist priest of this date:--\r\n\r\n“If one is a man, the mills of heaven and earth grind him to\r\nperfection; if not, to destruction.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA considerable amount of poetry was produced under the Mongol sway,\r\nthough not so much proportionately, nor of such a high order, as under\r\nthe great native dynasties. The Emperor Ch‘ien Lung published in 1787 a\r\ncollection of specimens of the poetry of this Yüan dynasty. They fill\r\neight large volumes, but are not much read.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LIU CHI]\r\n\r\nOne of the best known poets of this period is LIU CHI (A.D. 1311-1375),\r\nwho was also deeply read in the Classics and also a student of\r\nastrology. He lived into the Ming dynasty, which he helped to\r\nestablish, and was for some years the trusted adviser of its first\r\nruler. He lost favour, however, and was poisoned by a rival, it is\r\nsaid, with the Emperor’s connivance. The following lines, referring to\r\nan early visit to a mountain monastery, reveal a certain sympathy with\r\nBuddhism:--\r\n\r\n  “_I mounted when the cock had just begun,\r\n  And reached the convent ere the bells were done;\r\n  A gentle zephyr whispered o’er the lawn;\r\n  Behind the wood the moon gave way to dawn.\r\n  And in this pure sweet solitude I lay,\r\n  Stretching my limbs out to await the day,\r\n  No sound along the willow pathway dim\r\n  Save the soft echo of the bonzes’ hymn._”\r\n\r\nHere too is an oft-quoted stanza, to be found in any poetry primer:--\r\n\r\n  “_A centenarian ’mongst men\r\n  Is rare; and if one comes, what then?\r\n  The mightiest heroes of the past\r\n  Upon the hillside sleep at last._”\r\n\r\nThe prose writings of Liu Chi are much admired for their pure style,\r\nwhich has been said to “smell of antiquity.” One piece tells how a\r\ncertain noble who had lost all by the fall of the Ch‘in dynasty,\r\nB.C. 206, and was forced to grow melons for a living, had\r\nrecourse to divination, and went to consult a famous augur on his\r\nprospects.\r\n\r\n“Alas!” cried the augur, “what is there that Heaven can bestow save\r\nthat which virtue can obtain? Where is the efficacy of spiritual beings\r\nbeyond that with which man has endowed them? The divining plant is but\r\na dead stalk; the tortoise-shell a dry bone. They are but matter like\r\nourselves. And man, the divinest of all things, why does he not seek\r\nwisdom from within, rather than from these grosser stuffs?\r\n\r\n“Besides, sir, why not reflect upon the past--that past which gave\r\nbirth to this present? Your cracked roof and crumbling walls of to-day\r\nare but the complement of yesterday’s lofty towers and spacious halls.\r\nThe straggling bramble is but the complement of the shapely garden\r\ntree. The grasshopper and the cicada are but the complement of organs\r\nand flutes; the will-o’-the-wisp and firefly, of gilded lamps and\r\npainted candles. Your endive and watercresses are but the complement\r\nof the elephant-sinews and camel’s hump of days bygone; the maple-leaf\r\nand the rush, of your once rich robes and fine attire. Do not repine\r\nthat those who had not such luxuries then enjoy them now. Do not be\r\ndissatisfied that you, who enjoyed them then, have them now no more. In\r\nthe space of a day and night the flower blooms and dies. Between spring\r\nand autumn things perish and are renewed. Beneath the roaring cascade a\r\ndeep pool is found; dark valleys lie at the foot of high hills. These\r\nthings you know; what more can divination teach you?”\r\n\r\nAnother piece is entitled “Outsides,” and is a light satire on the\r\ncorruption of his day:--\r\n\r\n“At Hangchow there lived a costermonger who understood how to keep\r\noranges a whole year without letting them spoil. His fruit was always\r\nfresh-looking, firm as jade, and of a beautiful golden hue; but\r\ninside--dry as an old cocoon.\r\n\r\n“One day I asked him, saying, ‘Are your oranges for altar or\r\nsacrificial purposes, or for show at banquets? Or do you make this\r\noutside display merely to cheat the foolish? as cheat them you most\r\noutrageously do.’ ‘Sir,’ replied the orangeman, ‘I have carried on this\r\ntrade now for many years. It is my source of livelihood. I sell; the\r\nworld buys. And I have yet to learn that you are the only honest man\r\nabout, and that I am the only cheat. Perhaps it never struck you in\r\nthis light. The bâton-bearers of to-day, seated on their tiger skins,\r\npose as the martial guardians of the State; but what are they compared\r\nwith the captains of old? The broad-brimmed, long-robed Ministers of\r\nto-day pose as pillars of the constitution; but have they the wisdom\r\nof our ancient counsellors? Evil-doers arise, and none can subdue\r\nthem. The people are in misery, and none can relieve them. Clerks are\r\ncorrupt, and none can restrain them. Laws decay, and none can renew\r\nthem. Our officials eat the bread of the State and know no shame. They\r\nsit in lofty halls, ride fine steeds, drink themselves drunk with\r\nwine, and batten on the richest fare. Which of them but puts on an\r\nawe-inspiring look, a dignified mien?--all gold and gems without, but\r\ndry cocoons within. You pay, sir, no heed to these things, while you\r\nare very particular about my oranges.’\r\n\r\n“I had no answer to make. Was he really out of conceit with the age, or\r\nonly quizzing me in defence of his fruit?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE DRAMA\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE DRAMA]\r\n\r\nIf the Mongol dynasty added little of permanent value to the already\r\nvast masses of poetry, of general literature, and of classical\r\nexegesis, it will ever be remembered in connection with two important\r\ndepartures in the literary history of the nation. Within the century\r\ncovered by Mongol rule the Drama and the Novel may be said to have come\r\ninto existence. Going back to pre-Confucian or legendary days, we find\r\nthat from time immemorial the Chinese have danced set dances in time to\r\nmusic on solemn or festive occasions of sacrifice or ceremony. Thus we\r\nread in the Odes:--\r\n\r\n  “_Lightly, sprightly,\r\n    To the dance I go,\r\n  The sun shining brightly\r\n    In the court below._”\r\n\r\nThe movements of the dancers were methodical, slow, and dignified. Long\r\nfeathers and flutes were held in the hand and were waved to and fro as\r\nthe performers moved right or left. Words to be sung were added, and\r\nthen gradually the music and singing prevailed over the dance, gesture\r\nbeing substituted. The result was rather an operatic than a dramatic\r\nperformance, and the words sung were more of the nature of songs than\r\nof musical plays. In the _Tso Chuan_, under B.C. 545, we read of an\r\namateur attempt of the kind, organised by stable-boys, which frightened\r\ntheir horses and caused a stampede. Confucius, too, mentions the\r\narrogance of a noble who employed in his ancestral temple the number of\r\nsingers reserved for the Son of Heaven alone. It is hardly necessary to\r\nallude to the exorcism of evil spirits, carried out three times a year\r\nby officials dressed up in bearskins and armed with spear and shield,\r\nwho made a house to house visitation surrounded by a shouting and\r\nexcited populace. It is only mentioned here because some writers have\r\nassociated this practice with the origin of the drama in China. All we\r\nreally know is that in very early ages music and song and dance formed\r\nan ordinary accompaniment to religious and other ceremonies, and that\r\nthis continued for many centuries.\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of the eighth century, A.D., the Emperor\r\nMing Huang of the T‘ang dynasty, being exceedingly fond of music,\r\nestablished a College, known as the Pear-Garden, for training some\r\nthree hundred young people of both sexes. There is a legend that\r\nthis College was the outcome of a visit paid by his Majesty to the\r\nmoon, where he was much impressed by a troup of skilled performers\r\nattached to the Palace of Jade which he found there. It was apparently\r\nan institution to provide instrumentalists, vocalists, and possibly\r\ndancers, for Court entertainments, although some have held that the\r\n“youths of the Pear-Garden” were really actors, and the term is still\r\napplied to the dramatic fraternity. Nothing, however, which can be\r\ntruly identified with the actor’s art seems to have been known until\r\nthe thirteenth century, when suddenly the Drama, as seen in the modern\r\nChinese stage-play, sprang into being. In the present limited state of\r\nour knowledge on the subject, it is impossible to say how or why this\r\ncame about. We cannot trace step by step the development of the drama\r\nin China from a purely choral performance, as in Greece. We are simply\r\nconfronted with the accomplished fact.\r\n\r\nAt the same time we hear of dramatic performances among the Tartars\r\nat a somewhat earlier date. In 1031 K‘ung Tao-fu, a descendant of\r\nConfucius in the forty-fifth degree, was sent as envoy to the Kitans,\r\nand was received at a banquet with much honour. But at a theatrical\r\nentertainment which followed, a piece was played in which his sacred\r\nancestor, Confucius, was introduced as the low-comedy man; and this so\r\ndisgusted him that he got up and withdrew, the Kitans being forced to\r\napologise. Altogether, it would seem that the drama is not indigenous\r\nto China, but may well have been introduced from Tartar sources.\r\nHowever this may be, it is certain that the drama as known under the\r\nMongols is to all intents and purposes the drama of to-day, and a few\r\ngeneral remarks may not be out of place.\r\n\r\nPlays are acted in the large cities of China at public theatres\r\nall the year round, except during one month at the New Year, and\r\nduring the period of mourning for a deceased Emperor. There is no\r\ncharge for admission, but all visitors must take some refreshment.\r\nThe various Trade-Guilds have raised stages upon their premises,\r\nand give periodical performances free to all who will stand in an\r\nopen-air courtyard to watch them. Mandarins and wealthy persons often\r\nengage actors to perform in their private houses, generally while a\r\ndinner-party is going on. In the country, performances are provided by\r\npublic subscription, and take place at temples or on temporary stages\r\nput up in the roadway. These stages are always essentially the same.\r\nThere is no curtain, there are no wings, and no flies. At the back of\r\nthe stage are two doors, one for entrance and one for exit. The actors\r\nwho are to perform the first piece come in by the entrance door all\r\ntogether. When the piece is over, and as they are filing out through\r\nthe exit door, those who are cast for the second piece pass in through\r\nthe other door. There is no interval, and the musicians, who sit on\r\nthe stage, make no pause; hence many persons have stated that Chinese\r\nplays are ridiculously long, the fact being that half-an-hour to an\r\nhour would be about an average length for the plays usually performed,\r\nthough much longer specimens, such as would last from three to five\r\nhours, are to be found in books. Eight or ten plays are often performed\r\nat an ordinary dinner-party, a list of perhaps forty being handed round\r\nfor the chief guests to choose from.\r\n\r\nThe actors undergo a very severe physical training, usually between the\r\nages of nine and fourteen. They have to learn all kinds of acrobatic\r\nfeats, these being introduced freely into “military” plays. They also\r\nhave to practise walking on feet bound up in imitation of women’s\r\nfeet, no woman having been allowed on the stage since the days of the\r\nEmperor Ch‘ien Lung (A.D. 1736-1796), whose mother had been an\r\nactress. They have further to walk about in the open air for an hour or\r\nso every day, the head thrown back and the mouth wide open in order to\r\nstrengthen the voice; and finally, their diet is carefully regulated\r\naccording to a fixed system of training. Fifty-six actors make up a\r\nfull company, each of whom must know perfectly from 100 to 200 plays,\r\nthere being no prompter. These do not include the four- or five-act\r\nplays as found in books, but either acting editions of these, cut\r\ndown to suit the requirements of the stage, or short farces specially\r\nwritten. The actors are ranged under five classes according to their\r\ncapabilities, and consequently every one knows what part he is expected\r\nto take in any given play. Far from being an important personage, as\r\nin ancient Greece, the actor is under a social ban; and for three\r\ngenerations his descendants may not compete at the public examinations.\r\nYet he must possess considerable ability in a certain line; for\r\ninasmuch as there are no properties and no realism, he is wholly\r\ndependent for success upon his own powers of idealisation. There he is\r\nindeed supreme. He will gallop across the stage on horseback, dismount,\r\nand pass his horse on to a groom. He will wander down a street, and\r\nstop at an open shop-window to flirt with a pretty girl. He will hide\r\nin a forest, or fight from behind a battlemented wall. He conjures up\r\nby histrionic skill the whole paraphernalia of a scene which in Western\r\ncountries is grossly laid out by supers before the curtain goes up. The\r\ngeneral absence of properties is made up to some extent by the dresses\r\nof the actors, which are of the most gorgeous character, robes for\r\nEmperors and grandees running into figures which would stagger even a\r\nWest-end manager.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the actor must be a good contortionist, and excel\r\nin gesture. He must have a good voice, his part consisting of song and\r\n“spoken” in about equal proportions. To show how utterly the Chinese\r\ndisregard realism, it need only be stated that dead men get up and walk\r\noff the stage; sometimes they will even act the part of bearers and\r\nmake movements as though carrying themselves away. Or a servant will\r\nstep across to a leading performer and hand him a cup of tea to clear\r\nhis voice.\r\n\r\nThe merit of the plays performed is not on a level with the skill of\r\nthe performer. A Chinese audience does not go to hear the play, but\r\nto see the actor. In 1678, at a certain market-town, there was a play\r\nperformed which represented the execution of the patriot, General Yo\r\nFei (A.D. 1141), brought about by the treachery of a rival,\r\nCh‘in Kuei, who forged an order for that purpose. The actor who played\r\nCh‘in Kuei (a term since used contemptuously for a spittoon) produced a\r\nprofound sensation; so much so, that one of the spectators, losing all\r\nself-control, leapt upon the stage and stabbed the unfortunate man to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nMost Chinese plays are simple in construction and weak in plot. They\r\nare divided into “military” and “civil,” which terms have often been\r\nwrongly taken in the senses of tragedy and comedy, tragedy proper\r\nbeing quite unknown in China. The former usually deal with historical\r\nepisodes and heroic or filial acts by historical characters; and\r\nEmperors and Generals and small armies rush wildly about the stage,\r\nsometimes engaged in single combat, sometimes in turning head over\r\nheels. Battles are fought and rivals or traitors executed before\r\nthe very eyes of the audience. The “civil” plays are concerned with\r\nthe entanglements of every-day life, and are usually of a farcical\r\ncharacter. As they stand in classical collections or in acting\r\neditions, Chinese plays are as unobjectionable as Chinese poetry\r\nand general literature. On the stage, however, actors are allowed\r\ngreat license in gagging, and the direction which their gag takes is\r\nchiefly the reason which keeps respectable women away from the public\r\nplay-house.\r\n\r\nIt must therefore always be remembered that there is the play as it can\r\nbe read in the library, and again as it appears in the acting edition\r\nto be learnt, and finally as it is interpreted by the actor. These\r\nthree are often very different one from the other.\r\n\r\nThe following abstract will give a fair idea of the pieces to be found\r\non the play-bill of any Chinese theatre:--\r\n\r\nTHE THREE SUSPICIONS.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the Ming dynasty, a certain well-known General was\r\noccupied day and night in camp with preparations for resisting the\r\nadvance of the rebel army which ultimately captured Peking. While thus\r\ntemporarily absent from home, the tutor engaged for his son fell ill\r\nwith severe shivering fits, and the boy, anxious to do something to\r\nrelieve the sufferer, went to his mother’s room and borrowed a thick\r\nquilt. Late that night, the General unexpectedly returned home, and\r\nheard from a slave-girl in attendance of the tutor’s illness and of the\r\nloan of the quilt. Thereupon, he proceeded straight to the sick-room,\r\nto see how the tutor was getting on, but found him fast asleep. As\r\nhe was about to retire, he espied on the ground a pair of women’s\r\nslippers, which had been accidentally brought in with the quilt, and\r\nat once recognised to whom they belonged. Hastily quitting the still\r\nsleeping tutor, and arming himself with a sharp scimitar, he burst into\r\nhis wife’s apartment. He seized the terrified woman by the hair, and\r\ntold her that she must die; producing, in reply to her protestations,\r\nthe fatal pair of slippers. He yielded, however, to the entreaties of\r\nthe assembled slave-girls, and deferred his vengeance until he had\r\nput the following test. He sent a slave-girl to the tutor’s room,\r\nhimself following close behind with his naked weapon ready for use,\r\nbearing a message from her mistress to say she was awaiting him in her\r\nown room; in response to which invitation the voice of the tutor was\r\nheard from within, saying, “What! at this hour of the night? Go away,\r\nyou bad girl, or I will tell the master when he comes back!” Still\r\nunconvinced, the jealous General bade his trembling wife go herself\r\nand summon her paramour; resolving that if the latter but put foot\r\nover the threshold, his life should pay the penalty. But there was no\r\noccasion for murderous violence. The tutor again answered from within\r\nthe bolted door, “Madam, I may not be a saint, but I would at least\r\nseek to emulate the virtuous Chao Wên-hua (the Joseph of China). Go,\r\nand leave me in peace.” The General now changes his tone; and the\r\ninjured wife, she too changes hers. She attempts to commit suicide,\r\nand is only dissuaded by an abject apology on the part of her husband;\r\nin the middle of which, as the latter is on his knees, a slave-girl\r\ncreates roars of laughter by bringing her master, in mistake for wine,\r\na brimming goblet of vinegar, the Chinese emblem of connubial jealousy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following is a translation of the acting edition of a short play,\r\nas commonly performed, illustrating, but not to exaggeration, the\r\nslender and insufficient literary art which satisfies the Chinese\r\npublic, the verses of the original being quite as much doggerel as\r\nthose of the English version:--\r\n\r\nTHE FLOWERY BALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAMATIS PERSONÆ:\r\n\r\n  Su Tai-ch‘in,                       _a Suitor_.\r\n  Hu Mao-yüan,                        _a Suitor_.\r\n  P‘ing Kuei,                         _a Beggar_.\r\n  P‘u-sa,          _the Beggar’s Guardian Angel_.\r\n  Lady Wang,       _daughter of a high Mandarin_.\r\n  Gatekeeper.\r\n\r\n_Suitors, Servants, &c._\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE--_Outside the city of Ch‘ang-an_.\r\n\r\n  Su T‘ai-ch‘in. _At Ch‘ang-an city I reside:\r\n                 My father is a Mandarin;\r\n                 Oh! if I get the Flowery Ball,\r\n                 My cup of joy will overflow.\r\n                 My humble name is Su T‘ai-ch‘in.\r\n                 To-day the Lady Wang will throw\r\n                 A Flowery Ball to get a spouse;\r\n                 And if perchance this ball strikes me,\r\n                 I am a lucky man indeed.\r\n                 But now I must go on my way._\r\n\r\n[Walks on towards the city\r\n\r\n_Enter ~Hu Mao-yüan~._\r\n\r\n  Hu Mao-yüan.   _My father is a nobleman,\r\n                 And I’m a jolly roving blade;\r\n                 To-day the Lady Wang will throw\r\n                 A Flowery Ball to get a spouse.\r\n                 It all depends on destiny\r\n                 Whether or not this Ball strikes me.\r\n                 My humble name is Hu Mao-yüan;\r\n                 But as the Ball is thrown to-day\r\n                 I must be moving on my way.\r\n                 Why, that looks very like friend Su!\r\n                 I’ll call: “Friend Su, don’t go so fast.”_\r\n\r\n  Su.            _It’s Hu Mao-yüan: now where go you?_\r\n\r\n  Hu.            _To the Governor’s palace to get me a wife._\r\n\r\n  Su.            _To the Flowery Ball?

Many collections of these\r\nhave been published, not to mention the acting editions of each play,\r\nwhich can be bought at any bookstall for something like three a penny.\r\nOne of the best of such collections is the _Yüan ch‘ü hsüan tsa chi_,\r\nor Miscellaneous Selection of Mongol Plays, bound up in eight thick\r\nvolumes. It contains one hundred plays in all, with an illustration to\r\neach, according to the edition of 1615. A large proportion of these\r\ncannot be assigned to any author, and are therefore marked “anonymous.”\r\nEven when the authors’ names are given, they represent men altogether\r\nunknown in what the Chinese call literature, from which the drama is\r\nrigorously excluded.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHI CHÜN-HSIANG]\r\n\r\nThe following is a brief outline of a very well known play in five acts\r\nby CHI CHÜN-HSIANG, entitled “The Orphan of the Chao family,”\r\nand founded closely upon fact. It is the nearest approach which the\r\nChinese have made to genuine tragedy:--\r\n\r\nA wicked Minister of the sixth century B.C. plotted the\r\ndestruction of a rival named Chao Tun, and of all his family. He tells\r\nin the prologue how he had vainly trained a fierce dog to kill his\r\nrival, by keeping it for days without food and then setting it at a\r\ndummy, dressed to represent his intended victim, and stuffed with the\r\nheart and lights of a sheep. Ultimately, however, he had managed to\r\nget rid of all the male members of the family, to the number of three\r\nhundred, when he hears--and at this point the play proper begins--that\r\nthe wife of the last representative has given birth to a son. He\r\npromptly sends to find the child, which had meanwhile been carried\r\naway to a place of safety. Then a faithful servant of the family hid\r\nhimself on the hills with another child, while an accomplice informed\r\nthe Minister where the supposed orphan of the house of Chao was lying\r\nhidden. The child was accordingly slain, and by the hand of the\r\nMinister himself; the servant committed suicide. But the real heir\r\nescaped, and when he grew up he avenged the wrongs of his family by\r\nkilling the cruel Minister and utterly exterminating his race.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom beginning to end of this and similar plays there is apparently no\r\nattempt whatever at passion or pathos in the language--at any rate,\r\nnot in the sense in which those terms are understood by us. Nor are\r\nthere even rhetorical flowers to disguise the expression of commonplace\r\nthought. The Chinese actor can do a great deal with such a text; the\r\ntranslator, nothing. There is much, too, of a primitive character in\r\nthe setting of the play. Explanatory prologues are common, and actors\r\nusually begin by announcing their own names and further clearing the\r\nway for the benefit of the audience. The following story will give a\r\nfaint idea of the license conceded to the play-actor.\r\n\r\nMy attention was attracted on one occasion at Amoy by an unusually\r\nlarge crowd of Chinamen engaged in watching the progress of an open-air\r\ntheatrical performance. Roars of laughter resounded on all sides, and\r\non looking to see what was the moving cause of this extraordinary\r\nexplosion of merriment, I beheld to my astonishment a couple of rather\r\nseedy-looking foreigners occupying the stage, and apparently acting\r\nwith such spirit as to bring the house down at every other word. A\r\nmoment more and it was clear that these men of the West were not\r\nforeigners at all, but Chinamen dressed up for the purposes of the\r\npiece. The get-up, nevertheless, was remarkably good, if somewhat\r\nexaggerated, though doubtless the intention was to caricature or\r\nburlesque rather than to reproduce an exact imitation. There was the\r\nbilly-cock hat, and below it a florid face well supplied with red\r\nmoustaches and whiskers, the short cut-away coat and light trousers,\r\na blue neck-tie, and last, but not least, the ever-characteristic\r\nwalking-stick. Half the fun, in fact, was got out of this last\r\naccessory; for with it each one of the two was continually threatening\r\nthe other, and both united in violent gesticulations directed either\r\nagainst their brother-actors or sometimes against the audience at their\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nBefore going any further it may be as well to give a short outline of\r\nthe play itself, which happens to be not uninteresting and is widely\r\nknown from one end of China to the other. It is called “Slaying a Son\r\nat the Yamên Gate,” and the plot, or rather story, runs as follows:--\r\n\r\nA certain general of the Sung dynasty named Yang, being in charge of\r\none of the frontier passes, sent his son to obtain a certain wooden\r\nstaff from an outlying barbarian tribe. In this expedition the son not\r\nonly failed signally, but was further taken prisoner by a barbarian\r\nlady, who insisted upon his immediately leading her to the altar.\r\nShortly after these nuptials he returns to his father’s camp, and the\r\nlatter, in a violent fit of anger, orders him to be taken outside\r\nthe Yamên gate and be there executed forthwith. As the soldiers are\r\nleading him away, the young man’s mother comes and throws herself at\r\nthe general’s feet, and implores him to spare her son. This request the\r\nstern father steadily refuses to grant, even though his wife’s prayers\r\nare backed up by those of his own mother, of a prince of the Imperial\r\nblood, and finally by the entreaties of the Emperor himself. At this\r\njuncture in rushes the barbarian wife of the general’s condemned son,\r\nand as on a previous occasion the general himself had been taken\r\nprisoner by this very lady, and only ransomed on payment of a heavy\r\nsum of money, he is so alarmed that he sits motionless and unable to\r\nutter a word while with a dagger she severs the cords that bind her\r\nhusband, sets him free before the assembled party, and dares any one\r\nto lay a hand on him at his peril. The Emperor now loses his temper,\r\nand is enraged to think that General Yang should have been awed into\r\ngranting to a barbarian woman a life that he had just before refused to\r\nthe entreaties of the Son of Heaven. His Majesty, therefore, at once\r\ndeprives the father of his command and bestows it upon the son, and the\r\nplay is brought to a conclusion with the departure of young General\r\nYang and his barbarian wife to subdue the wild tribes that are then\r\nharassing the frontier of China. The two foreigners are the pages or\r\nattendants of the barbarian wife, and accompany her in that capacity\r\nwhen she follows her husband to his father’s camp.\r\n\r\nThe trick of dressing these pages up to caricature the foreigner of\r\nthe nineteenth century, on the occasion when I saw the piece, was a\r\nmere piece of stage gag, but one which amused the people immensely, and\r\nelicited rounds of applause. But when the barbarian wife had succeeded\r\nin rescuing her husband from the jaws of death, there was considerable\r\ndissatisfaction in the minds of several of the personages on the stage.\r\nThe Emperor was angry at the slight that had been passed upon his\r\nImperial dignity, the wife and mother of the general, not to mention\r\nthe prince of the blood, felt themselves similarly slighted, though\r\nin a lesser degree, and the enraged father was still more excited\r\nat having had his commands set aside, and seeing himself bearded in\r\nhis own Yamên by a mere barbarian woman. It was consequently felt\r\nby all parties that something in the way of slaughter was wanting to\r\nrelieve their own feelings, and to satisfy the unities of the drama\r\nand the cravings of the audience for a sensational finale; and this\r\ndesirable end was attained by an order from the Emperor that at any\r\nrate the two foreign attendants might be sacrificed for the benefit of\r\nall concerned. The two wretched foreigners were accordingly made to\r\nkneel on the stage, and their heads were promptly lopped off by the\r\nexecutioner amid the deafening plaudits of the surrounding spectators.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1885 a play was performed in a Shanghai theatre which had for its\r\nspecial attraction a rude imitation of a paddle-steamer crowded with\r\nforeign men and women. It was wheeled across the back of the stage, and\r\nthe foreigners and their women, who were supposed to have come with\r\ndesigns upon the Middle Kingdom, were all taken prisoners and executed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WANG SHIH-FU]\r\n\r\nOf all plays of the Mongol dynasty, the one which will best repay\r\nreading is undoubtedly the _Hsi Hsiang Chi_, or Story of the Western\r\nPavilion, in sixteen scenes. It is by WANG SHIH-FU, of whom\r\nnothing seems to be known except that he flourished in the thirteenth\r\ncentury, and wrote thirteen plays, all of which are included in the\r\ncollection mentioned above. “The dialogue of this play,” says a Chinese\r\ncritic, “deals largely with wind, flowers, snow, and moonlight,” which\r\nis simply a euphemistic way of stating that the story is one of passion\r\nand intrigue. It is popular with the educated classes, by whom it is\r\nregarded more as a novel than as a play.\r\n\r\nA lady and her daughter are staying at a temple, where, in accordance\r\nwith common custom, rooms are let by the priests to ordinary\r\ntravellers or to visitors who may wish to perform devotional exercises.\r\nA young and handsome student, who also happens to be living at the\r\ntemple, is lucky enough to succeed in saving the two ladies from the\r\nclutches of brigands, for which service he has previously been promised\r\nthe hand of the daughter in marriage. The mother, however, soon repents\r\nof her engagement, and the scholar is left disconsolate. At this\r\njuncture the lady’s-maid of the daughter manages by a series of skilful\r\nmanœuvres to bring the story to a happy issue.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHANG KUO-PIN]\r\n\r\nJust as there have always been poetesses in China, so women are to be\r\nfound in the ranks of Chinese playwrights. A four-act drama, entitled\r\n“Joining the Shirt,” was written by one CHANG KUO-PIN, an\r\neducated courtesan of the day, the chief interest of which play lies\r\nperhaps in the sex of the writer.\r\n\r\nA father and mother, with son and daughter-in-law, are living happily\r\ntogether, when a poverty-stricken young stranger is first of all\r\nassisted by them, and then, without further inquiry, is actually\r\nadopted into the family. Soon afterwards the new son persuades the\r\nelder brother and his wife secretly to leave home, taking all the\r\nproperty they can lay their hands on, and to journey to a distant part\r\nof the country, where there is a potent god from whom the wife is to\r\npray for and obtain a son after what has been already an eighteen\r\nmonths’ gestation. On the way, the new brother pushes the husband\r\noverboard into the Yang-tsze and disappears with the wife, who shortly\r\ngives birth to a boy. Eighteen years pass. The old couple have sunk\r\ninto poverty, and set out, begging their way, to seek for their lost\r\nson. Chance--playwright’s chance--throws them into the company of their\r\ngrandson, who has graduated as Senior Classic, and has also, prompted\r\nby his mother, been on the look-out for them. Recognition is effected\r\nby means of the two halves of a shirt, one of which had always been\r\nkept by the old man and the other by the missing son, and after his\r\ndeath by his wife. At this juncture the missing son reappears. He had\r\nbeen rescued from drowning by a boatman, and had become a Buddhist\r\npriest. He now reverts to lay life, and the play is brought to an end\r\nby the execution of the villain.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that all the best troupes of actors not only come\r\nfrom Peking, but perform in their own dialect, which is practically\r\nunintelligible to the masses in many parts of China. These actors are,\r\nof course, very well paid, in order to make it worth their while to\r\ntravel so far from home and take the risks to life and property.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE NOVEL\r\n\r\n\r\nTurning now to the second literary achievement of the Mongols, the\r\nintroduction of the Novel, we find ourselves face to face with the same\r\nmystery as that which shrouds the birth of the Drama. The origin of\r\nthe Chinese novel is unknown. It probably came from Central Asia, the\r\nparadise of story-tellers, in the wake of the Mongol conquest. Three\r\ncenturies had then to elapse before the highest point of development\r\nwas reached. Fables, anecdotes, and even short stories had already\r\nbeen familiar to the Chinese for many centuries, but between these\r\nand the novel proper there is a wide gulf which so far had not been\r\nsatisfactorily bridged. Some, indeed, have maintained that the novel\r\nwas developed from the play, pointing in corroboration of their theory\r\nto the _Hsi Hsiang Chi_, or Story of the Western Pavilion, described in\r\nthe preceding chapter. This, however, simply means that the _Hsi Hsiang\r\nChi_ is more suited for private reading than for public representation,\r\nas is the case with many Western plays.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese range their novels under four heads, as dealing (1)\r\nwith usurpation and plotting, (2) with love and intrigue, (3) with\r\nsuperstition, and (4) with brigandage or lawless characters generally.\r\nExamples of each class will be given.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LO KUAN-CHUNG]\r\n\r\nThe _San kuo chih yen i_, attributed to one LO KUAN-CHUNG, is an\r\nhistorical novel based upon the wars of the Three Kingdoms which fought\r\nfor supremacy at the beginning of the third century A.D. It consists\r\nmainly of stirring scenes of warfare, of cunning plans by skilful\r\ngenerals, and of doughty deeds by blood-stained warriors. Armies\r\nand fleets of countless myriads are from time to time annihilated\r\nby one side or another,--all this in an easy and fascinating style,\r\nwhich makes the book an endless joy to old and young alike. If a vote\r\nwere taken among the people of China as to the greatest among their\r\ncountless novels, the Story of the Three Kingdoms would indubitably\r\ncome out first.\r\n\r\nThis is how the great commander Chu-ko Liang is said to have\r\nreplenished his failing stock of arrows. He sent a force of some twenty\r\nor more ships to feign an attack on the fleet of his powerful rival,\r\nTs‘ao Ts‘ao. The decks of the ships were apparently covered with large\r\nnumbers of fighting men, but these were in reality nothing more than\r\nstraw figures dressed up in soldiers’ clothes. On each ship there\r\nwere only a few sailors and some real soldiers with gongs and other\r\nnoisy instruments. Reaching their destination, as had been carefully\r\ncalculated beforehand, in the middle of a dense fog, the soldiers\r\nat once began to beat on their gongs as if about to go into action;\r\nwhereupon Ts‘ao Ts‘ao, who could just make out the outlines of vessels\r\ndensely packed with fighting men bearing down upon him, gave orders to\r\nhis archers to begin shooting. The latter did so, and kept on for an\r\nhour and more, until Chu-ko Liang was satisfied with what he had got,\r\nand passed the order to retreat.\r\n\r\nElsewhere we read of an archery competition which recalls the Homeric\r\ngames. A target is set up, and the prize, a robe, is hung upon a\r\ntwig just above. From a distance of one hundred paces the heroes\r\nbegin to shoot. Of course each competitor hits the bull’s-eye, one,\r\nParthian-like, with his back to the target, another shooting over his\r\nown head; and equally of course the favoured hero shoots at the twig,\r\nsevers it, and carries off the robe.\r\n\r\nThe following extract will perhaps be interesting, dealing as it does\r\nwith the use of anæsthetics long before they were dreamt of in this\r\ncountry. Ts‘ao Ts‘ao had been struck on the head with a sword by the\r\nspirit of a pear-tree which he had attempted to cut down. He suffered\r\nsuch agony that one of his staff recommended a certain doctor who was\r\nthen very much in vogue:--\r\n\r\n“‘Dr. Hua,’ explained the officer, ‘is a mighty skilful physician, and\r\nsuch a one as is not often to be found. His administration of drugs,\r\nand his use of acupuncture and counter-irritants are always followed\r\nby the speedy recovery of the patient. If the sick man is suffering\r\nfrom some internal complaint and medicines produce no satisfactory\r\nresult, then Dr. Hua will administer a dose of hashish, under the\r\ninfluence of which the patient becomes as it were intoxicated with\r\nwine. He now takes a sharp knife and opens the abdomen, proceeding\r\nto wash the patient’s viscera with medicinal liquids, but without\r\ncausing him the slightest pain. The washing finished, he sews up the\r\nwound with medicated thread and puts over it a plaster, and by the\r\nend of a month or twenty days the place has healed up. Such is his\r\nextraordinary skill. One day, for instance, as he was walking along a\r\nroad, he heard some one groaning deeply, and at once declared that the\r\ncause was indigestion. On inquiry, this turned out to be the case; and\r\naccordingly, Dr. Hua ordered the sufferer to drink three pints of a\r\ndecoction of garlic and leeks, which he did, and vomited forth a snake\r\nbetween two and three feet in length, after which he could digest food\r\nas before. On another occasion, the Governor of Kuang-ling was very\r\nmuch depressed in his mind, besides being troubled with a flushing of\r\nthe face and total loss of appetite. He consulted Dr. Hua, and the\r\neffect of some medicine administered by him was to cause the invalid to\r\nthrow up a quantity of red-headed wriggling tadpoles, which the doctor\r\ntold him had been generated in his system by too great indulgence in\r\nfish, and which, although temporarily expelled, would reappear after\r\nan interval of three years, when nothing could save him. And sure\r\nenough, he died three years afterwards. In a further instance, a man\r\nhad a tumour growing between his eyebrows, the itching of which was\r\ninsupportable. When Dr. Hua saw it, he said, ‘There is a bird inside,’\r\nat which everybody laughed. However, he took a knife and opened the\r\ntumour, and out flew a canary, the patient beginning to recover from\r\nthat hour. Again, another man had had his toes bitten by a dog, the\r\nconsequence being that two lumps of flesh grew up from the wound, one\r\nof which was very painful while the other itched unbearably. ‘There\r\nare ten needles,’ said Dr. Hua, ‘in the sore lump, and two black and\r\nwhite _wei-ch‘i_ pips in the other.’ No one believed this until Dr. Hua\r\nopened them with a knife and showed that it was so. Truly he is of the\r\nsame strain as Pien Ch‘iao and Ts‘ang Kung of old; and as he is now\r\nliving not very far from this, I wonder your Highness does not summon\r\nhim.’\r\n\r\n“At this, Ts‘ao Ts‘ao sent away messengers who were to travel day and\r\nnight until they had brought Dr. Hua before him; and when he arrived,\r\nTs‘ao Ts‘ao held out his pulse and desired him to diagnose his case.\r\n\r\n“‘The pain in your Highness’s head’ said Dr. Hua, ‘arises from wind,\r\nand the seat of the disease is the brain, where the wind is collected,\r\nunable to get out. Drugs are of no avail in your present condition,\r\nfor which there is but one remedy. You must first swallow a dose of\r\nhashish, and then with a sharp axe I will split open the back of your\r\nhead and let the wind out. Thus the disease will be exterminated.’\r\n\r\n“Ts‘ao Ts‘ao here flew into a great rage, and declared that it was\r\na plot aimed at his life; to which Dr. Hua replied, ‘Has not your\r\nHighness heard of Kuan Yü’s wound in the right shoulder? I scraped the\r\nbone and removed the poison for him without a single sign of fear on\r\nhis part. Your Highness’s disease is but a trifling affair; why, then,\r\nso much suspicion?’\r\n\r\n“‘You may scrape a sore shoulder-bone,’ said Ts‘ao Ts‘ao, ‘without much\r\nrisk; but to split open my skull is quite another matter. It strikes me\r\nnow that you are here simply to avenge your friend Kuan Yü upon this\r\nopportunity.’ He thereupon gave orders that the doctor should be seized\r\nand cast into prison.”\r\n\r\nThere the unfortunate doctor soon afterwards died, and before very long\r\nTs‘ao Ts‘ao himself succumbed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SHIH NAI-AN]\r\n\r\nThe _Shui Hu Chuan_ is said to have been written by SHIN\r\nNAI-AN of the thirteenth century; but this name does not appear\r\nin any biographical collection, and nothing seems to be known either\r\nof the man or of his authorship. The story is based upon the doings of\r\nan historical band of brigands, who had actually terrorised a couple\r\nof provinces, until they were finally put down, early in the twelfth\r\ncentury. Some of it is very laughable, and all of it valuable for the\r\ninsight given into Chinese manners and customs. There is a ludicrous\r\nepisode of a huge swashbuckler who took refuge in a Buddhist temple\r\nand became a priest. After a while he reverted to less ascetic habits\r\nof life, and returned one day to the temple, in Chinese phraseology,\r\nas drunk as a clod, making a great riot and causing much scandal. He\r\ndid this on a second occasion; and when shut out by the gatekeeper, he\r\ntried to burst in, and in his drunken fury knocked to pieces a huge\r\nidol at the entrance for not stepping down to his assistance. Then,\r\nwhen he succeeded by a threat of fire in getting the monks to open the\r\ngate, “through which no wine or meat may pass,” he fell down in the\r\ncourtyard, and out of his robe tumbled a half-eaten dog’s leg, which\r\nhe had carried away with him from the restaurant where he had drunk\r\nhimself tipsy. This he amused himself by tearing to pieces and forcing\r\ninto the mouth of one of his fellow-priests.\r\n\r\nThe graphic and picturesque style in which this book is written, though\r\napproaching the colloquial, has secured for it a position rather beyond\r\nits real merits.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE HSI YU CHI]\r\n\r\nThe _Hsi Yu Chi_, or Record of Travels in the West, is a favourite\r\nnovel written in a popular and easy style. It is based upon the journey\r\nof Hsüan Tsang to India in search of books, images, and relics to\r\nillustrate the Buddhist religion; but beyond the fact that the chief\r\npersonage is called by Hsüan Tsang’s posthumous title, and that he\r\ntravels in search of Buddhist books, the journey and the novel have\r\npositively nothing in common. The latter is a good sample of the\r\nfiction in which the Chinese people delight, and may be allowed to\r\ndetain us awhile.\r\n\r\nA stone monkey is born on a mysterious mountain from a stone egg, and\r\nis soon elected to be king of the monkeys. He then determines to travel\r\nin search of wisdom, and accordingly sets forth. His first step is\r\nto gain a knowledge of the black art from a magician, after which he\r\nbecomes Master of the Horse to God, that is, to the supreme deity in\r\nthe Taoist Pantheon. Throwing up his post in disgust, he carries on a\r\nseries of disturbances in the world generally, until at length God is\r\nobliged to interfere, and sends various heavenly generals to coerce\r\nhim. These he easily puts to flight, only returning to his allegiance\r\non being appointed the Great Holy One of All the Heavens. He is soon\r\nat his old tricks again, stealing the peaches of immortality from a\r\nlegendary being known as the Royal Mother in the West, and also some\r\nelixir of life, both of which he consumes.\r\n\r\nAll the minor deities now complain to God of his many misdeeds, and\r\nheavenly armies are despatched against him, but in vain. Even God’s\r\nnephew cannot prevail against him until Lao Tzŭ throws a magic ring at\r\nhim and knocks him down. He is then carried captive to heaven, but as\r\nhe is immortal, no harm can be inflicted on him.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture God places the matter in the hands of Buddha, who is\r\npresently informed by the monkey that God must be deposed and that he,\r\nthe monkey, must for the future reign in his stead. The text now runs\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n“When Buddha heard these words, he smiled scornfully and said, ‘What!\r\na devil-monkey like you to seize the throne of God, who from his\r\nearliest years has been trained to rule, and has lived 1750 æons, each\r\nof 129,600 years’ duration! Think what ages of apprenticeship he had to\r\nserve before he could reach this state of perfect wisdom. You are only\r\na brute beast; what mean these boastful words? Be off, and utter no\r\nmore such, lest evil befall, and your very existence be imperilled.’\r\n\r\n“‘Although he is older than I am,’ cried the monkey, ‘that is no reason\r\nwhy he should always have the post. Tell him to get out and give up his\r\nplace to me, or I will know the reason why.’\r\n\r\n“‘What abilities have you,’ asked Buddha, ‘that you should claim the\r\ndivine palace?’\r\n\r\n“‘Plenty,’ replied the monkey. ‘I can change myself into seventy-two\r\nshapes; I am immortal; and I can turn a somersault to a distance of\r\n18,000 _li_ ( = 6000 miles). Am I not fit to occupy the throne of\r\nheaven?’\r\n\r\n“‘Well,’ answered Buddha, ‘I will make a wager with you. If you can\r\njump out of my hand, I will request God to depart to the West and leave\r\nheaven to you; but if you fail, you will go down again to earth and be\r\na devil for another few æons to come.’\r\n\r\n“The monkey readily agreed to this, pointing out that he could easily\r\njump 18,000 _li_, and that Buddha’s hand was not even a foot long. So\r\nafter making Buddha promise to carry out the agreement, he grasped his\r\nsceptre and diminished in size until he could stand in the hand, which\r\nwas stretched out for him like a lotus-leaf. ‘I’m off!’ he cried, and\r\nin a moment he was gone. But Buddha’s enlightened gaze was ever upon\r\nhim, though he turned with the speed of a whirligig.\r\n\r\n“In a brief space the monkey had reached a place where there were five\r\nred pillars, and there he decided to stop. Reflecting, however, that he\r\nhad better leave some trace as a proof of his visit, he plucked out a\r\nhair, and changing it into a pencil, wrote with it on the middle pillar\r\nin large characters, _The Great Holy One of All the Heavens reached\r\nthis point_. The next moment he was back again in Buddha’s hand,\r\ndescribing his jump, and claiming his reward.\r\n\r\n“‘Ah!’ said Buddha, ‘I knew you couldn’t do it.’\r\n\r\n“‘Why,’ said the monkey, ‘I have been to the very confines of the\r\nuniverse, and have left a mark there which I challenge you to inspect.’\r\n\r\n“‘There is no need to go so far,’ replied Buddha. ‘Just bend your head\r\nand look here.’\r\n\r\n“The monkey bent down his head, and there, on Buddha’s middle finger,\r\nhe read the following inscription: _The Great Holy One of All the\r\nHeavens reached this point_.”\r\n\r\nUltimately, the monkey is converted to the true faith, and undertakes\r\nto escort Hsüan Tsang on his journey to the West. In his turn he helps\r\nto convert a pig-bogey, whom he first vanquishes by changing himself\r\ninto a pill, which the pig-bogey unwittingly swallows, thereby giving\r\nits adversary a chance of attacking it from inside. These two are\r\njoined by a colourless individual, said to represent the passive side\r\nof man’s nature, as the monkey and pig represent the active and animal\r\nsides respectively. The three of them conduct Hsüan Tsang through\r\nmanifold dangers and hairbreadth escapes safe, until at length they\r\nreceive final directions from an Immortal as to the position of the\r\npalace of Buddha, from which they hope to obtain the coveted books. The\r\nscene which follows almost recalls _The Pilgrims Progress_:--\r\n\r\n“Hsüan Tsang accordingly bade him farewell and proceeded on his way.\r\nBut he had not gone more than a mile or two before he came to a stream\r\nof rushing water about a league in breadth, with not a trace of any\r\nliving being in sight. At this he was somewhat startled, and turning\r\nto Wu-k‘ung (the name of the monkey) said, ‘Our guide must surely\r\nhave misdirected us. Look at that broad and boiling river; how shall\r\nwe ever get across without a boat?’ ‘There is a bridge over there,’\r\ncried Wu-k‘ung, ‘which you must cross over in order to complete\r\nyour salvation.’ At this Hsüan Tsang and the others advanced in the\r\ndirection indicated, and saw by the side of the bridge a notice-board\r\non which was written, ‘The Heavenly Ford.’ Now the bridge itself\r\nconsisted of a simple plank; on which Hsüan Tsang remarked, ‘I am not\r\ngoing to trust myself to that frail and slippery plank to cross that\r\nwide and rapid stream. Let us try somewhere else.’ ‘But this is the\r\ntrue path,’ said Wu-k‘ung; ‘just wait a moment and see me go across.’\r\nThereupon he jumped on to the bridge, and ran along the shaky vibrating\r\nplank until he reached the other side, where he stood shouting out to\r\nthe rest to come on. But Hsüan Tsang waved his hand in the negative,\r\nwhile his companions stood by biting their fingers and crying out, ‘We\r\ncan’t! we can’t! we can’t!’ So Wu-k‘ung ran back, and seizing Pa-chieh\r\n(the pig) by the arm, began dragging him to the bridge, all the time\r\ncalling him a fool for his pains. Pa-chieh then threw himself on the\r\nground, roaring out, ‘It’s too slippery--it’s too slippery. I can’t\r\ndo it. Spare me! spare me!’ ‘You must cross by this bridge,’ replied\r\nWu-k‘ung, ‘if you want to become a Buddha;’ at which Pa-chieh said,\r\n‘Then I can’t be a Buddha, sir. I have done with it: I shall never get\r\nacross that bridge.’\r\n\r\n“While these two were in the middle of their dispute, lo and behold a\r\nboat appeared in sight, with a man punting it along, and calling out,\r\n‘The ferry! the ferry!’ At this Hsüan Tsang was overjoyed, and shouted\r\nto his disciples that they would now be able to get across. By his\r\nfiery pupil and golden iris, Wu-k‘ung knew that the ferryman was no\r\nother than Namo Pao-chang-kuang-wang Buddha; but he kept his knowledge\r\nto himself, and hailed the boat to take them on board. In a moment it\r\nwas alongside the bank, when, to his unutterable horror, Hsüan Tsang\r\ndiscovered that the boat had no bottom, and at once asked the ferryman\r\nhow he proposed to take them across. ‘My boat,’ replied the ferryman,\r\n‘has been famed since the resolution of chaos into order, and under my\r\ncharge has known no change. Steady though storms may rage and seas may\r\nroll, there is no fear so long as the passenger is light. Free from the\r\ndust of mortality, the passage is easy enough. Ten thousand kalpas of\r\nhuman beings pass over in peace. A bottomless ship can hardly cross the\r\ngreat ocean; yet for ages past I have ferried over countless hosts of\r\npassengers.’\r\n\r\n“When he heard these words Wu-k‘ung cried out, ‘Master, make haste on\r\nboard. This boat, although bottomless, is safe enough, and no wind or\r\nsea could overset it.’ And while Hsüan Tsang was still hesitating,\r\nWu-k‘ung pushed him forwards on to the bridge; but the former could not\r\nkeep his feet, and fell head over heels into the water, from which he\r\nwas immediately rescued by the ferryman, who dragged him on board the\r\nboat. The rest also managed, with the aid of Wu-k‘ung, to scramble on\r\nboard; and then, as the ferryman shoved off, lo! they beheld a dead\r\nbody floating away down the stream. Hsüan Tsang was greatly alarmed\r\nat this; but Wu-k‘ung laughed and said, ‘Fear not, Master; that dead\r\nbody is your old self!’ And all the others joined in the chorus of ‘It\r\nis you, sir, it is you;’ and even the ferryman said, ‘Yes, it is you;\r\naccept my best congratulations.’\r\n\r\n“A few moments more and the stream was crossed, when they all jumped\r\non shore; but before they could look round the boat and ferryman had\r\ndisappeared.”\r\n\r\nThe story ends with a list of the Buddhist _sûtras_ and liturgies\r\nwhich the travellers were allowed to carry back with them to their own\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE SEVENTH\r\n\r\n_THE MING DYNASTY_ (A.D. 1368-1644)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS LITERATURE--MATERIA MEDICA--ENCYCLOPÆDIA OF AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SUNG LIEN]\r\n\r\nThe first Emperor of the Ming dynasty, popularly known as the Beggar\r\nKing, in allusion to the poverty of his early days, so soon as he\r\nhad extinguished the last hopes of the Mongols and had consolidated\r\nhis power, turned his attention to literature and education. He\r\norganised the great system of competitive examinations which prevails\r\nat the present day. He also published a Penal Code, abolishing such\r\npunishments as mutilation, and drew up a kind of Domesday Book, under\r\nwhich taxation was regulated. In 1369 he appointed SUNG LIEN\r\n(A.D. 1310-1381), in conjunction with other scholars, to\r\nproduce the History of the Mongol Dynasty. Sung Lien had previously\r\nbeen tutor to the heir apparent. He had declined office, and was\r\nleading the life of a simple student. He rose to be President of the\r\nHan-lin College, and for many years enjoyed his master’s confidence.\r\nA grandson, however, became mixed up in a conspiracy, and only the\r\nEmpress’s entreaties saved the old man’s life. His sentence was\r\ncommuted to banishment, and he died on the journey. Apart from the\r\nhistory above mentioned, and a pronouncing dictionary on which he was\r\nemployed, his literary remains fill only three volumes. The following\r\npiece is a satire on the neglect of men of ability, which, according to\r\nhim, was a marked feature of the administration of the Mongols:--\r\n\r\n“Têng Pi, whose cognomen was Po-i, was a man of Ch‘in. He was seven\r\nfeet high. Both his eyes had crimson corners, and they blinked like\r\nlightning flashes. In feats of strength he was cock of the walk; and\r\nonce when his neighbour’s bulls were locked in fight, with a blow of\r\nhis fist he broke the back of one of them and sent it rolling on the\r\nground. The stone drums of the town, which ten men could not lift,\r\nhe could carry about in his two hands. He was, however, very fond of\r\nliquor, and given to quarrelling in his cups; so that when people saw\r\nhim in this mood, they would keep out of his way, saying that it was\r\nsafer to be at a distance from such a wild fellow.\r\n\r\n“One day he was drinking by himself in a tea-house when two literati\r\nhappened to pass by. Têng Pi tried to make them join him; but they,\r\nhaving rather a low opinion of the giant, would not accept his\r\ninvitation. ‘Gentlemen,’ cried he in a rage, ‘if you do not see fit\r\nto do as I ask, I will make an end of the pair of you, and then seek\r\nsafety in flight. I could not brook this treatment at your hands.’\r\n\r\n“So the two had no alternative but to walk in. Têng Pi took the place\r\nof honour himself, and put his guests on each side of him. He called\r\nfor more liquor, and began to sing and make a noise. And at last, when\r\nhe was well tipsy, he threw off his clothes and began to attitudinise.\r\nHe drew a knife, and flung it down with a bang on the table; at which\r\nthe two literati, who were aware of his weakness, rose to take leave.\r\n\r\n“‘Stop!’ shouted Têng Pi, detaining them. ‘I too know something about\r\nyour books. What do you mean by treating me as the spittle of your\r\nmouth? If you don’t hurry up and drink, I fear my temper will get the\r\nbetter of me. Meanwhile, you shall ask me anything you like in the\r\nwhole range of classical literature, and if I can’t answer, I will\r\nimbrue this blade in my blood.’\r\n\r\n“To this the two literati agreed, and forthwith gave him a number\r\nof the most difficult allusions they could think of, taken from the\r\nClassics; but Têng Pi was equal to the occasion, and repeated the full\r\nquotation in each case without missing a word. Then they tried him on\r\nhistory, covering a period of three thousand years; but here again his\r\nanswers were distinguished by accuracy and precision.\r\n\r\n“‘Ha! ha!’ laughed Têng Pi, ‘do you give in now?’ At which his guests\r\nlooked blankly at each other, and hadn’t a word to say. So Têng Pi\r\nshouted for wine, and loosed his hair, and jumped about, crying, ‘I\r\nhave floored you, gentlemen, to-day! Of old, learning made a man of\r\nyou; but to-day, all you have to do is to don a scholar’s dress and\r\nlook consumptive. You care only to excel with pen and ink, and despise\r\nthe real heroes of the age. Shall this be so indeed?’\r\n\r\n“Now these two literati were men of some reputation, and on hearing\r\nTêng Pi’s words they were greatly shamed, and left the tea-house,\r\nhardly knowing how to put one foot before the other. On arriving home\r\nthey made further inquiries, but no one had ever seen Têng Pi at any\r\ntime with a book in his hand.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FANG HSIAO-JU]\r\n\r\nFANG HSIAO-JU (A.D. 1357-1402) is another scholar, co-worker with Sung\r\nLien, who adorned this same period. As a child he was precocious, and\r\nby his skill in composition earned for himself the nickname of Little\r\nHan Yü. He became tutor to one of the Imperial princes, and was loaded\r\nwith honours by the second Emperor, who through the death of his father\r\nsucceeded in 1398 to his grandfather. Then came the rebellion of the\r\nfourth son of the first Emperor; and when Nanking opened its gates to\r\nthe conqueror, the defeated nephew vanished. It is supposed that he\r\nfled to Yünnan, in the garb of a monk, left to him, so the story runs,\r\nwith full directions by his grandfather. After nearly forty years’\r\nwandering, he is said to have gone to Peking, and lived in seclusion in\r\nthe palace until his death. He was recognised by a eunuch from a mole\r\non his left foot, but the eunuch was afraid to reveal his identity.\r\nFang Hsiao-ju absolutely refused to place his services at the disposal\r\nof the new Emperor, who ruled under the year-title of Yung Lo. For this\r\nrefusal he was cut to pieces in the market-place, his family being as\r\nfar as possible exterminated and his philosophical writings burned.\r\nA small collection of his miscellanies was preserved by a faithful\r\ndisciple, and afterwards republished. The following is an extract from\r\nan essay on taking too much thought for the morrow:--\r\n\r\n“Statesmen who forecast the destinies of an empire ofttimes concentrate\r\ntheir genius upon the difficult and neglect the easy. They provide\r\nagainst likely evils, and disregard combinations which yield no ground\r\nfor suspicion. Yet calamity often issues from neglected quarters, and\r\nsedition springs out of circumstances which have been set aside as\r\ntrivial. Must this be regarded as due to an absence of care?--No. It\r\nresults because the things that man can provide against are human,\r\nwhile those that elude his vigilance and overpower his strength are\r\ndivine.”\r\n\r\nAfter giving several striking examples from history, the writer\r\ncontinues:--\r\n\r\n“All the instances above cited include gifted men whose wisdom and\r\ngenius overshadowed their generation. They took counsel and provided\r\nagainst disruption of the empire with the utmost possible care. Yet\r\nmisfortune fell upon every one of them, always issuing from some source\r\nwhere its existence was least suspected. This, because human wisdom\r\nreaches only to human affairs and cannot touch the divine. Thus, too,\r\nwill sickness carry off the children even of the best doctors, and\r\ndevils play their pranks in the family of an exorcist. How is it that\r\nthese professors, who succeed in grappling with the cases of others,\r\nyet fail in treating their own? It is because in those they confine\r\nthemselves to the human; in these they would meddle with the divine.\r\n\r\n“The men of old knew that it was impossible to provide infallibly\r\nagainst the convulsions of ages to come. There was no plan, no device,\r\nby which they could hope to prevail, and they refrained accordingly\r\nfrom vain scheming. They simply strove by the force of Truth and Virtue\r\nto win for themselves the approbation of God; that He, in reward for\r\ntheir virtuous conduct, might watch over them, as a fond mother watches\r\nover her babes, for ever. Thus, although fools were not wanting to\r\ntheir posterity--fools able to drag an empire to the dust--still, the\r\nevil day was deferred. This was indeed foresight of a far-reaching kind.\r\n\r\n“But he who, regardless of the favour of Heaven, may hope by the light\r\nof his own petty understanding to establish that which shall endure\r\nthrough all time--he shall be confounded indeed.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe third Emperor of this dynasty, whose nephew, the reigning Emperor,\r\ndisappeared so mysteriously, mounted the throne in 1403. A worthy son\r\nof his father as regarded his military and political abilities, he\r\nwas a still more enthusiastic patron of literature. He caused to be\r\ncompiled what is probably the most gigantic encyclopædia ever known,\r\nthe _Yung Lo Ta Tien_, to produce which 2169 scholars laboured for\r\nabout three years under the guidance of five chief directors and twenty\r\nsub-directors. Judging from the account published in 1795, it must have\r\nrun to over 500,000 pages. It was never printed because of the cost of\r\nthe block-cutting; but under a subsequent reign two extra copies were\r\ntaken, and one of these, imperfect to the extent of about 20,000 pages,\r\nis still in the Han-lin College at Peking.[33] The others perished by\r\nfire at the fall of the Ming dynasty. Not only did this encyclopædia\r\nembrace and illustrate the whole range of Chinese literature, but it\r\nincluded many complete works which would otherwise have been lost. Of\r\nthese, no fewer than 66 on the Confucian Canon, 41 on history, 103\r\non philosophy, and 175 on poetry were copied out and inserted in the\r\nImperial Library.\r\n\r\nMany names of illustrious scholars must here, as indeed throughout\r\nthis volume, be passed over in silence. Such writers are more than\r\ncompensated by the honour they receive from their own countrymen, who\r\nplace classical scholarship at the very summit of human ambitions, and\r\nrank the playwright and the novelist as mere parasites of literature.\r\nBetween these two extremes there is always to be found a great deal\r\nof general writing, which, while it satisfies the fastidious claim of\r\nthe Chinese critic for form in preference even to matter, is also of\r\nsufficient interest for the European reader.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: YANG CHI-SHÊNG]\r\n\r\nYANG CHI-SHÊNG (1515-1556) was a statesman and a patriot, who\r\nhad been a cowherd in his youth. He first got himself into trouble by\r\nopposing the establishment of a horse-market on the frontier, between\r\nChina and Tartary, as menacing the safety of his country. Restored to\r\nfavour after temporary degradation, he impeached a colleague, now known\r\nas the worst of the Six Traitorous Ministers of the Ming dynasty. His\r\nadversary was too strong for him. Yang was sent to prison, and three\r\nyears later his head fell. His name has no place in literature; nor\r\nwould it be mentioned here except as an introduction to an impassioned\r\nmemorial which his wife addressed to the Emperor on her husband’s\r\nbehalf:--\r\n\r\n“May it please your Majesty,--My husband was chief Minister in the\r\nCavalry Department of the Board of War. Because he advised your Majesty\r\nagainst the establishment of a tradal mart, hoping to prevent Ch‘ou\r\nLuan from carrying out his design, he was condemned only to a mild\r\npunishment; and then, when the latter suffered defeat, he was restored\r\nto favour and to his former honours.\r\n\r\n“Thereafter, my husband was for ever seeking to make some return for\r\nthe Imperial clemency. He would deprive himself of sleep. He would\r\nabstain from food. All this I saw with my own eyes. By and by, however,\r\nhe gave ear to some idle rumour of the market-place, and the old habit\r\ncame strong upon him. He lost his mental balance. He uttered wild\r\nstatements, and again incurred the displeasure of the Throne. Yet he\r\nwas not slain forthwith. His punishment was referred to the Board. He\r\nwas beaten; he was thrown into prison. Several times he nearly died.\r\nHis flesh was hollowed out beneath the scourge; the sinews of his legs\r\nwere severed. Blood flowed from him in bowlfuls, splashing him from\r\nhead to foot. Confined day and night in a cage, he endured the utmost\r\nmisery.\r\n\r\n“Then our crops failed, and daily food was wanting in our\r\npoverty-stricken home. I strove to earn money by spinning, and worked\r\nhard for the space of three years, during which period the Board twice\r\naddressed the Throne, receiving on each occasion an Imperial rescript\r\nthat my husband was to await his fate in gaol. But now I hear your\r\nMajesty has determined that my husband shall die, in accordance with\r\nthe statutes of the Empire. Die as he may, his eyes will close in peace\r\nwith your Majesty, while his soul seeks the realms below.\r\n\r\n“Yet I know that your Majesty has a humane and kindly heart; and\r\nwhen the creeping things of the earth,--nay, the very trees and\r\nshrubs,--share in the national tranquillity, it is hard to think that\r\nyour Majesty would grudge a pitying glance upon our fallen estate. And\r\nshould we be fortunate enough to attract the Imperial favour to our\r\nlowly affairs, that would be joy indeed. But if my husband’s crime is\r\nof too deep a dye, I humbly beg that my head may pay the penalty, and\r\nthat I be permitted to die for him. Then, from the far-off land of\r\nspirits, myself brandishing spear and shield, I will lead forth an army\r\nof fierce hobgoblins to do battle in your Majesty’s behalf, and thus\r\nmake some return for this act of Imperial grace.”\r\n\r\n“The force of language,” says the commentator, “can no farther go.”\r\nYet this memorial, “the plaintive tones of which,” he adds, “appeal\r\ndirect to the heart,” was never allowed to reach the Emperor. Twelve\r\nyears later, the Minister impeached by Yang Chi-shêng was dismissed for\r\nscandalous abuse of power, and had all his property confiscated. Being\r\nreduced to beggary, he received from the Emperor a handsome silver bowl\r\nin which to collect alms; but so universally hated was he that no one\r\nwould either give him anything or venture to buy the bowl, and he died\r\nof starvation while still in the possession of wealth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SHÊN SU]\r\n\r\nA curiously similar case, with a happier ending, was that of SHÊN\r\nSU, who, in the discharge of his duties as Censor, also denounced\r\nthe same Minister, before whose name the word “traitorous” is now\r\nalways inserted. Shên Su was thrown into prison, and remained there for\r\nfifteen years. He was released in consequence of the following memorial\r\nby his wife, of which the commentator says, “for every drop of ink a\r\ndrop of blood”:--\r\n\r\n“May it please your Majesty,--My husband was a Censor attached to the\r\nBoard of Rites. For his folly in recklessly advising your Majesty, he\r\ndeserved indeed a thousand deaths; yet under the Imperial clemency he\r\nwas doomed only to await his sentence in prison.\r\n\r\n“Since then fourteen years have passed away. His aged parents are\r\nstill alive, but there are no children in his hall, and the wretched\r\nman has none on whom he can rely. I alone remain--a lodger at an inn,\r\nworking day and night at my needle to provide the necessaries of life;\r\nencompassed on all sides by difficulties; to whom every day seems a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n“My father-in-law is eighty-seven years of age. He trembles on the\r\nbrink of the grave. He is like a candle in the wind. I have naught\r\nwherewith to nourish him alive or to honour him when dead. I am a\r\nlone woman. If I tend the one, I lose the other. If I return to my\r\nfather-in-law, my husband will die of starvation. If I remain to feed\r\nhim, my father-in-law may die at any hour. My husband is a criminal\r\nbound in gaol. He dares give no thought to his home. Yet can it be\r\nthat when all living things are rejoicing in life under the wise and\r\ngenerous rule of to-day, we alone should taste the cup of poverty and\r\ndistress, and find ourselves beyond the pale of universal peace?\r\n\r\n“Oft, as I think of these things, the desire to die comes upon me; but\r\nI swallow my grief and live on, trusting in Providence for some happy\r\ntermination, some moistening with the dew of Imperial grace. And now\r\nthat my father-in-law is face to face with death; now that my husband\r\ncan hardly expect to live--I venture to offer this body as a hostage,\r\nto be bound in prison, while my husband returns to watch over the last\r\nhours of his father. Then, when all is over, he will resume his place\r\nand await your Majesty’s pleasure. Thus my husband will greet his\r\nfather once again, and the feelings of father and child will be in some\r\nmeasure relieved. Thus I shall give to my father-in-law the comfort of\r\nhis son, and the duty of a wife towards her husband will be fulfilled.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TSUNG CH’ÊN]\r\n\r\nTSUNG CH’ÊN gained some distinction during this sixteenth\r\ncentury; in youth, by his great beauty, and especially by his\r\neyes, which were said to flash fire even at the sides; later on,\r\nby subscribing to the funeral expenses of the above-mentioned Yang\r\nChi-shêng; and finally, by his successful defence of Foochow against\r\nthe Japanese, whose forces he enticed into the city by a feint of\r\nsurrender, and then annihilated from the walls. The following piece,\r\nwhich, in the opinion of the commentator, “verges upon trifling,”\r\nis from his correspondence. Several sentences of it have quite a\r\nJuvenalian ring:--\r\n\r\n“I was very glad at this distance to receive your letter, which quite\r\nset my mind at rest, together with the present you were so kind as to\r\nadd. I thank you very much for your good wishes, and especially for\r\nyour thoughtful allusion to my father.\r\n\r\n“As to what you are pleased to say in reference to official popularity\r\nand fitness for office, I am much obliged by your remarks. Of my\r\nunfitness I am only too well aware; while as to popularity with my\r\nsuperiors, I am utterly unqualified to secure that boon.\r\n\r\n“How indeed does an official find favour in the present day with his\r\nchief? Morning and evening he must whip up his horse and go dance\r\nattendance at the great man’s door. If the porter refuses to admit him,\r\nthen honeyed words, a coaxing air, and money drawn from the sleeve,\r\nmay prevail. The porter takes in his card; but the great man does not\r\ncome out. So he waits in the stable among grooms, until his clothes\r\nare charged with the smell, in spite of hunger, in spite of cold, in\r\nspite of a blazing heat. At nightfall, the porter who has pocketed the\r\nmoney comes forth and says his master is tired and begs to be excused,\r\nand will he call again next day. So he is forced to come once more as\r\nrequested. He sits all night in his clothes. At cock-crow he jumps up,\r\nperforms his toilette, and gallops off and knocks at the entrance gate.\r\n‘Who’s there?’ shouts the porter angrily; and when he explains, the\r\nporter gets still more angry and begins to abuse him, saying, ‘You are\r\nin a fine hurry, you are! Do you think my master sees people at this\r\nhour?’ Then is the visitor shamed, but has to swallow his wrath and\r\ntry to persuade the porter to let him in. And the porter, another fee\r\nto the good, gets up and lets him in; and then he waits again in the\r\nstable as before, until perhaps the great man comes out and summons him\r\nto an audience.\r\n\r\n“Now, with many an obeisance, he cringes timidly towards the foot of\r\nthe daïs steps; and when the great man says ‘Come!’ he prostrates\r\nhimself twice and remains long without rising. At length he goes up to\r\noffer his present, which the great man refuses. He entreats acceptance;\r\nbut in vain. He implores, with many instances; whereupon the great man\r\nbids a servant take it. Then two more prostrations, long drawn out;\r\nafter which he arises, and with five or six salutations he takes his\r\nleave.\r\n\r\n“On going forth, he bows to the porter, saying, ‘It’s all right\r\nwith your master. Next time I come you need make no delay.’ The\r\nporter returns the bow, well pleased with his share in the business.\r\nMeanwhile, our friend springs on his horse, and when he meets an\r\nacquaintance flourishes his whip and cries out, ‘I have just been\r\nwith His Excellency. He treated me very kindly, very kindly indeed.’\r\nAnd then he goes into detail, upon which his friends begin to be more\r\nrespectful to him as a _protégé_ of His Excellency. The great man\r\nhimself says, ‘So-and-so is a good fellow, a very good fellow indeed;’\r\nupon which the bystanders of course declare that they think so too.\r\n\r\n“Such is popularity with one’s superiors in the present day. Do\r\nyou think that I could be as one of these? No! Beyond sending in a\r\ncomplimentary card at the summer and winter festivals, I do not go\r\nnear the great from one year’s end to another. Even when I pass their\r\ndoors I stuff my ears and cover my eyes, and gallop quickly by, as if\r\nsome one was after me. In consequence of this want of breadth, I am of\r\ncourse no favourite with the authorities; but what care I? There is a\r\ndestiny that shapes our ends, and it has shaped mine towards the path\r\nof duty alone. For which, no doubt, you think me an ass.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WANG TAO-K‘UN]\r\n\r\nWANG TAO-K‘UN took his third degree in 1547. His instincts\r\nseemed to be all for a soldier’s life, and he rose to be a successful\r\ncommander. He found ample time, however, for books, and came to occupy\r\nan honourable place among contemporary writers. His works, which,\r\naccording to one critic, are “polished in style and lofty in tone,”\r\nhave been published in a uniform edition, and are still read. The\r\nfollowing is a cynical skit upon the corruption of his day:--\r\n\r\n“A retainer was complaining to Po Tzŭ that no one in the district knew\r\nhow to get on.\r\n\r\n“‘You gentlemen,’ said he, ‘are like square handles which you would\r\nthrust into the round sockets of your generation. Consequently, there\r\nis not one of you which fits.’\r\n\r\n“‘You speak truth,’ replied Po Tzŭ; ‘kindly explain how this is so.’\r\n\r\n“‘There are five reasons,’ said the retainer, ‘why you are at\r\nloggerheads with the age, as follows:--\r\n\r\n“‘(1) The path to popularity lies straight before you, but you will not\r\nfollow it.\r\n\r\n“‘(2) Other men’s tongues reach the soft places in the hearts of their\r\nsuperiors, but your tongues are too short.\r\n\r\n“‘(3) Others eschew fur robes, and approach with bent backs as if their\r\nvery clothes were too heavy for them; but you remain as stiff-necked as\r\nplanks.\r\n\r\n“‘(4) Others respond even before they are called, and seek to\r\nanticipate the wishes of their superiors; whose enemies, were they\r\nthe saints above, would not escape abuse; whose friends, were they\r\nhighwaymen and thieves, would be larded over with praise. But you--you\r\nstick at facts and express opinions adverse to those of your superiors,\r\nwhom it is your special interest to conciliate.\r\n\r\n“‘(5) Others make for gain as though bent upon shooting a pheasant,\r\nwatching in secret and letting fly with care, so that nothing escapes\r\ntheir aim. But you--you hardly bend your bow, or bend it only to miss\r\nthe quarry that lies within your reach.\r\n\r\n“‘One of these five failings is like a tumour hanging to you and\r\nimpeding your progress in life. How much more all of them!’\r\n\r\n“‘It is indeed as you state,’ answered Po Tzŭ. ‘But would you bid me\r\ncut these tumours away? A man may have a tumour and live. To cut it\r\noff is to die. And life with a tumour is better than death without.\r\nBesides, beauty is a natural gift; and the woman who tried to look like\r\nHsi Shih only succeeded in frightening people out of their wits by her\r\nugliness. Now it is my misfortune to have these tumours, which make me\r\nmore loathsome even than that woman. Still, I can always, so to speak,\r\nstick to my needle and my cooking-pots, and strive to make my good\r\nman happy. There is no occasion for me to proclaim my ugliness in the\r\nmarket-place.’\r\n\r\n“‘Ah, sir,’ said the retainer, ‘now I know why there are so many ugly\r\npeople about, and so little beauty in the land.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HSÜ HSIEH]\r\n\r\nHSÜ HSIEH graduated as Senior Classic in 1601, and received an\r\nappointment in the Han-lin College, where all kinds of State documents\r\nare prepared under the superintendence of eminent scholars. Dying\r\nyoung, he left behind him the reputation of a cross-grained man, with\r\nwhom it was difficult to get along, ardently devoted to study. He swore\r\nthat if it were granted to him to acquire a brilliant style, he would\r\njump into the sea to circulate his writings. The following piece is\r\nmuch admired. “It is completed,” says a commentator, “with the breath\r\nof a yawn (with a single effort), and is like a heavenly robe, without\r\nseam. The reader looks in vain for paragraphing in this truly inspired\r\npiece”:--\r\n\r\n“For some years I had possessed an old inkstand, left at my house by\r\na friend. It came into ordinary use as such, I being unaware that\r\nit was an antique. However, one day a connoisseur told me it was at\r\nleast a thousand years old, and urged me to preserve it carefully as\r\na valuable relic. This I did, but never took any further trouble to\r\nascertain whether such was actually the case or not. For supposing\r\nthat this inkstand really dated from the period assigned, its then\r\nowner must have regarded it simply as an inkstand. He could not have\r\nknown that it was destined to survive the wreck of time and to come to\r\nbe cherished as an antique. And while we prize it now, because it has\r\ndescended to us from a distant past, we forget that then, when antiques\r\nwere relics of a still earlier period, it could not have been of any\r\nvalue to antiquarians, themselves the moderns of what is antiquity to\r\nus! The surging crowd around us thinks of naught but the acquisition\r\nof wealth and material enjoyment, occupied only with the struggle for\r\nplace and power. Men lift their skirts and hurry through the mire; they\r\nsuffer indignity and feel no sense of shame. And if from out this mass\r\nthere arises one spirit purer and simpler than the rest, striving to\r\ntread a nobler path than they, and amusing his leisure, for his own\r\ngratification, with guitars, and books, and pictures, and other relics\r\nof olden times,--such a man is indeed a genuine lover of the antique.\r\nHe can never be one of the common herd, though the common herd always\r\naffect to admire whatever is admittedly admirable. In the same way,\r\npersons who aim at advancement in their career will spare no endeavour\r\nto collect the choicest rarities, in order, by such gifts, to curry\r\nfavour with their superiors, who in their turn will take pleasure in\r\nostentatious display of their collections of antiquities. Such is but\r\na specious hankering after antiques, arising simply from a desire\r\nto eclipse one’s neighbours. Such men are not genuine lovers of the\r\nantique. Their tastes are those of the common herd after all, though\r\nthey make a great show and filch the reputation of true antiquarians,\r\nin the hope of thus distinguishing themselves from their fellows,\r\nignorant as they are that what they secure is the name alone without\r\nthe reality. The man whom I call a genuine antiquarian is he who\r\nstudies the writings of the ancients, and strives to form himself upon\r\ntheir model, though unable to greet them in the flesh; who ever and\r\nanon, in his wanderings up and down the long avenue of the past, lights\r\nupon some choice fragment which brings him in an instant face to face\r\nwith the immortal dead. Of such enjoyment there is no satiety. Those\r\nwho truly love antiquity, love not the things, but the men of old,\r\nsince a relic in the present is much what it was in the past,--a mere\r\nthing. And so if it is not to things, but rather to men, that devotion\r\nis due, then even I may aspire to be some day an antique. Who shall say\r\nthat centuries hence an antiquarian of the day may not look up to me as\r\nI have looked up to my predecessors? Should I then neglect myself, and\r\nfoolishly devote my energies to trifling with things?\r\n\r\n“Such is popular enthusiasm in these matters. It is shadow without\r\nsubstance. But the theme is endless, and I shall therefore content\r\nmyself with a passing record of my old inkstand.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LI SHIH-CHÊN]\r\n\r\nThis chapter may close with the names of two remarkable men. LI\r\nSHIH-CHÊN completed in 1578, after twenty-six years of unremitting\r\nlabour, his great Materia Medica. In 1596 the manuscript was laid\r\nbefore the Emperor, who ordered it to be printed forthwith. It deals\r\n(1) with Inanimate substances; (2) with Plants; and (3) with Animals,\r\nand is illustrated by over 1100 woodcuts. The introductory chapter\r\npasses in review forty-two previous works of importance on the same\r\nsubject, enumerating no fewer than 950 miscellaneous publications on\r\na variety of subjects. The famous “doctrine of signatures,” which\r\nsupposes that the uses of plants and substances are indicated to man by\r\ncertain appearances peculiar to them, figures largely in this work.\r\n\r\nHSÜ KUANG-CH’I (1562-1634) is generally regarded as the only\r\ninfluential member of the mandarinate who has ever become a convert\r\nto Christianity. After graduating first among the candidates for\r\nthe second degree in 1597 and taking his final degree in 1604, he\r\nenrolled himself as a pupil of Matteo Ricci, and studied under his\r\nguidance to such purpose that he was able to produce works on the\r\nnew system of astronomy as introduced by the Jesuit Fathers, besides\r\nvarious treatises on mathematical science. He was also author of an\r\nencyclopædia of agriculture of considerable value, first published in\r\n1640. This work is illustrated with numerous woodcuts, and treats of\r\nthe processes and implements of husbandry, of rearing silkworms, of\r\nbreeding animals, of the manufacture of food, and even of precautions\r\nto be taken against famine. The Jesuit Fathers themselves scattered\r\nbroadcast over China a large number of propagandist publications,\r\nwritten in polished book-style, some few of which are still\r\noccasionally to be found in old book-shops.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[33] On the 23rd June 1900, almost while these words were being\r\nwritten, the Han-lin College was burnt to the ground. The writer’s\r\nyoungest son, Mr. Lancelot Giles, who went through the siege of Peking,\r\nwrites as follows:--“An attempt was made to save the famous _Yung Lo\r\nTa Tien_, but heaps of volumes had been destroyed, so the attempt was\r\ngiven up. I secured vol. 13,345 for myself.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nNOVELS AND PLAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nNovels were produced in considerable numbers under the Ming dynasty,\r\nbut the names of their writers, except in a very few cases, have\r\nnot been handed down. The marvellous work known as the _Ch‘in P‘ing\r\nMei_, from the names of three of the chief female characters, has\r\nbeen attributed to the grave scholar and statesman, Wang Shih-chêng\r\n(1526-1593); but this is more a guess than anything else. So also is\r\nthe opinion that it was produced in the seventeenth century, as a\r\ncovert satire upon the morals of the Court of the great Emperor K‘ang\r\nHsi. The story itself refers to the early part of the twelfth century,\r\nand is written in a simple, easy style, closely approaching the Peking\r\ncolloquial. It possesses one extraordinary characteristic. Many words\r\nand phrases are capable of two interpretations, one of which is of a\r\nclass which renders such passages unfit for ears polite. Altogether the\r\nbook is objectionable, and would require a translator with the nerve of\r\na Burton.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Yü Chiao Li_ is a tale of the fifteenth century which has found\r\nmuch favour in the eyes of foreigners, partly because it is of an\r\nunusually moderate length. The ordinary Chinaman likes his novels long,\r\nand does not mind plenty of repetitions after the style of Homer,\r\nwhich latter feature seems to point in the direction of stories told by\r\nword of mouth and written down later on, and may be taken in connection\r\nwith the opinion already expressed, that the Chinese novel came\r\noriginally from Central Asia. Here, however, in four small volumes, we\r\nhave a charming story of a young graduate who falls in love first with\r\na beautiful and accomplished poetess, and then with the fascinating\r\nsister of a fascinating friend whose acquaintance--the brother’s--he\r\nmakes casually by the roadside. The friend and the sister turn out to\r\nbe one and the same person, a very lively girl, who appears in male\r\nor female dress as occasion may require; and what is more, the latter\r\nyoung lady turns out to be the much-loved orphan cousin of the first\r\nand still cherished young lady, and also her intellectual equal. The\r\ngraduate is madly in love with the two girls, and they are irrevocably\r\nin love with him. This is a far simpler matter than it would be in\r\nWestern countries. The hero marries both, and all three live happily\r\never afterwards.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE LIEH KUO CHUAN]\r\n\r\nThe _Lieh Kuo Chuan_, anonymous as usual, is a historical novel dealing\r\nwith the exciting times of the Feudal States, and covering the period\r\nbetween the eighth century B.C. and the union of China under\r\nthe First Emperor. It is introduced to the reader in these words:--\r\n\r\n“The _Lieh Kuo_ is not like an ordinary novel, which consists mainly of\r\nwhat is not true. Thus the _Fêng Shên_ (a tale of the twelfth century\r\nB.C.), the _Shui Hu_, the _Hsi Yu Chi_, and others, are pure\r\nfabrications. Even the _San Kuo Chih_, which is very near to truth,\r\ncontains much that is without foundation. Not so the _Lieh Kuo_. There\r\nevery incident is a real incident, every speech a real speech. Besides,\r\nas there is far more to tell than could possibly be told, it is not\r\nlikely that the writer would go out of his way to invent. Wherefore the\r\nreader must look upon the _Lieh Kuo_ as a genuine history, and not as a\r\nmere novel.”\r\n\r\nThe following extract refers to a bogus exhibition, planned by the\r\nscheming State of Ch‘in, nominally to make a collection of valuables\r\nand hand them over as respectful tribute to the sovereign House of\r\nChou, but really with a view to a general massacre of the rival nobles\r\nwho stood in the way between the Ch‘ins and their treasonable designs:--\r\n\r\n“Duke Ai of Ch‘in now proceeded with his various officers of State to\r\nprepare a place for the proposed exhibition, at the same time setting\r\na number of armed men in ambuscade, with a view to carry out his\r\nambitious designs; and when he heard that the other nobles had arrived,\r\nhe went out and invited them to come in. The usual ceremonies over, and\r\nthe nobles having taken their seats according to precedence, Duke Ai\r\naddressed the meeting as follows:--\r\n\r\n“‘I, having reverently received the commission of the Son of Heaven,\r\ndo hereby open this assembly for the exhibition of such valuables as\r\nmay be brought together from all parts of the empire, the same to be\r\nsubsequently packed together, and forwarded as tribute to our Imperial\r\nmaster. And since you nobles are now all collected here in this place,\r\nit is fitting that our several exhibits be forthwith produced and\r\nsubmitted for adjudication.’\r\n\r\n“Sounds of assent from the nobles were heard at the conclusion of this\r\nspeech, but the Prime Minister of the Ch‘i State, conscious that the\r\natmosphere was heavily laden with the vapour of death, as if from\r\ntreacherous ambush, stepped forward and said:--\r\n\r\n“‘Of old, when the nobles were wont to assemble, it was customary to\r\nappoint one just and upright member to act as arbiter or judge of\r\nthe meeting; and now that we have thus met for the purposes of this\r\nexhibition, I propose, in the interest of public harmony, that some one\r\nof us be nominated arbiter in a similar way.’\r\n\r\n“Duke Ai readily agreed to the above proposition, and immediately\r\ndemanded of the assembled nobles who among them would venture to accept\r\nthe office indicated. These words were scarcely out of his mouth when\r\nup rose Pien Chuang, generalissimo of the forces of Chêng, and declared\r\nthat he was ready to undertake the post. Duke Ai then asked him upon\r\nwhat grounds, as to personal ability, he based his claim; to which Pien\r\nChuang replied, ‘Of ability I have little indeed, but I have slain a\r\ntiger with one blow of my fist, and in martial prowess I am second to\r\nnone. Upon this I base my claim.’\r\n\r\n“Accordingly, Duke Ai called for a golden tablet, and was on the point\r\nof investing him as arbiter of the exhibition, when a voice was heard\r\nfrom among the retainers of the Wu State, loudly urging, ‘The slayer of\r\na tiger need be possessed only of physical courage; but how is that a\r\nsufficient recommendation for this office? Delay awhile, I pray, until\r\nI come and take the tablet myself.’\r\n\r\n“By this time Duke Ai had seen that the speaker was K‘uai Hui, son of\r\nthe Duke of Wei, and forthwith inquired of him what his particular\r\nclaim to the post might be. ‘I cut the head off a deadly dragon, and\r\nfor that feat I claim this post.’ Duke Ai thereupon ordered Pien Chuang\r\nto transfer to him the golden tablet; but this he refused to do,\r\narguing that the slaughter of a dragon was simply a magician’s trick,\r\nand not at all to the present purpose. He added that if the tablet was\r\nto be taken from him, it would necessitate an appeal to force between\r\nhimself and his rival. The contest continued thus for some time,\r\nuntil at length the Prime Minister of Ch‘i rose again, and solved the\r\ndifficulty in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n“‘The slaughter of a tiger involves physical courage, and the slaughter\r\nof a dragon is a magician’s trick; hence, neither of these acts\r\nembraces that combination of mental and physical power which we desire\r\nin the arbiter of this meeting. Now, in front of the palace there\r\nstands a sacrificial vessel which weighs about a thousand pounds.\r\nLet Duke Ai give out a theme; and then let him who replies thereto\r\nwith most clearness and accuracy, and who can, moreover, seize the\r\naforesaid vessel, and carry it round the platform on which the eighteen\r\nrepresentative nobles are seated, be nominated to the post of arbiter\r\nand receive the golden tablet.’\r\n\r\n“To this plan Duke Ai assented; and writing down a theme, bade his\r\nattendants exhibit it among the heroes of the assembled States. The\r\ntheme was in rhyme, and contained these eight lines:--\r\n\r\n  ‘_Say what supports the sky; say what supports the earth;\r\n  What is the mystic number which to the universe gave birth?\r\n  Whence come the eddying waves of the river’s rolling might?\r\n  Where shall we seek the primal germ of the mountain’s towering height?\r\n  By which of the elements five is the work of Nature done?\r\n  And of all the ten thousand things that are, say which is the\r\n      wondrous ~one~?\r\n  Such are the questions seven which I now propound to you;\r\n  And he who can answer them straight and well is the trusty man\r\n      and true._’\r\n\r\n“The theme had hardly been uttered, when up started Chi Nien,\r\ngeneralissimo of the Ch‘in State, and cried out, ‘This is but a\r\nquestion of natural philosophy; what difficulty is there in it?’ He\r\nthereupon advanced to the front, and, having obtained permission to\r\ncompete, seized a stylus and wrote down the following reply:--\r\n\r\n  ‘_Nothing supports the sky; nothing supports the earth;\r\n  How can we guess at the number which to the universe gave birth?\r\n  From the reaches above come the eddying waves of the river’s\r\n      rolling might:\r\n  How can we tell where to look for the germ of the mountain’s towering\r\n      height?\r\n  By every one of the elements five is the work of Nature done;\r\n  And of all the ten thousand things that are there is no particular\r\n      ~one~.\r\n  There you have my replies to the questions set by you;\r\n  And the arbiter’s post I hereby claim as the trusty man and true._’\r\n\r\n“Chi Nien, having delivered this answer, proceeded to tuck up his\r\nrobe, and, passing to the front of the palace, seized with both hands\r\nthe sacrificial vessel, and raised it some two feet from the ground,\r\nhis whole face becoming suffused with colour under the effort. At\r\nthe same time there arose a great noise of drums and horns, and all\r\nthe assembled nobles applauded loudly; whereupon Duke Ai personally\r\ninvested him with the golden tablet and proclaimed him arbiter of\r\nthe exhibition, for which Chi Nien was just about to return thanks,\r\nwhen suddenly up jumped Wu Yüan, generalissimo of the Ch‘u State, and\r\ncoming forward, declared in an angry tone that Chi Nien’s answer did\r\nnot dispose of the theme in a proper and final manner; that he had not\r\nremoved the sacrificial vessel from its place, and that consequently he\r\nhad not earned the appointment which Wu Yüan now contended should be\r\nbestowed upon himself. Duke Ai, in view of his scheme for seizing the\r\npersons of the various nobles, was naturally anxious that the post of\r\narbiter should fall to one of his own officers, and was much displeased\r\nat this attempt on the part of Wu Yüan; however, he replied that if\r\nthe latter could dispose of the theme and carry round the sacrificial\r\nvessel, the office of arbiter would be his. Wu Yüan thereupon took a\r\nstylus and indited the following lines:--\r\n\r\n  ‘_The earth supports the sky; the sky supports the earth.\r\n  ~Five~ is the mystic number which to the universe gave birth.\r\n  Down from the sky come the eddying waves of the river’s rolling might.\r\n  In the K‘un-lun range we must seek the germ of the mountain’s towering\r\n      height.\r\n  By ~truth~, of the elements five, can most good work be done;\r\n  And of all the ten thousand things that are, ~man~ is the wondrous one.\r\n  There you have my replies to the questions set this day;\r\n  The answers are clear and straight to the point, and given without\r\n      delay._’\r\n\r\n“As soon as he had finished writing, he handed his reply to Duke Ai,\r\nwho at once saw that he had in every way disposed of the theme with\r\nfar greater skill than Chi Nien, and accordingly now bade him show\r\nhis strength upon the sacrificial vessel. Wu Yüan immediately stepped\r\nforward, and, holding up his robe with his left hand, seized the vessel\r\nwith his right, raising it up and bearing it round the platform before\r\nthe assembled nobles, and finally depositing it in its original place,\r\nwithout so much as changing colour. The nobles gazed at each other in\r\nastonishment at this feat, and with one accord declared him to be the\r\nhero of the day; so that Duke Ai had no alternative but to invest him\r\nwith the golden tablet and announce his appointment to the post of\r\narbiter.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE CHING HUA YÜAN]\r\n\r\nThe _Ching Hua Yüan_ is a less pretentious work than the preceding, but\r\nof an infinitely more interesting character. Dealing with the reign\r\nof the Empress Wu, who in A.D. 684 set aside the rightful\r\nheir and placed herself upon the throne, which she occupied for\r\ntwenty years, this work describes how a young graduate, named T‘ang,\r\ndisgusted with the establishment of examinations and degrees for women,\r\nset out with a small party on a voyage of exploration. Among all the\r\nstrange places which they visited, the most curious was the Country of\r\nGentlemen, where they landed and proceeded at once to the capital city.\r\n\r\n“There, over the city gate, T‘ang and his companions read the following\r\nlegend:--\r\n\r\n    ‘_Virtue is man’s only jewel!_’\r\n\r\n“They then entered the city, which they found to be a busy and\r\nprosperous mart, the inhabitants all talking the Chinese language.\r\nAccordingly, T‘ang accosted one of the passers-by, and asked him how it\r\nwas his nation had become so famous for politeness and consideration of\r\nothers; but, to his great astonishment, the man did not understand the\r\nmeaning of his question. T‘ang then asked him why this land was called\r\nthe ‘Country of Gentlemen,’ to which he likewise replied that he did\r\nnot know. Several other persons of whom they inquired giving similar\r\nanswers, the venerable To remarked that the term had undoubtedly been\r\nadopted by the inhabitants of adjacent countries, in consequence of\r\nthe polite manners and considerate behaviour of these people. ‘For,’\r\nsaid he, ‘the very labourers in the fields and foot-passengers in the\r\nstreets step aside to make room for one another. High and low, rich and\r\npoor, mutually respect each other’s feelings without reference to the\r\nwealth or social status of either; and this is, after all, the essence\r\nof what constitutes the true gentleman.’\r\n\r\n“‘In that case,’ cried T‘ang, ‘let us not hurry on, but rather improve\r\nourselves by observing the ways and customs of this people.’\r\n\r\n“By and by they arrived at the market-place, where they saw an official\r\nrunner standing at a stall engaged in making purchases. He was holding\r\nin his hand the articles he wished to buy, and was saying to the owner\r\nof the stall, ‘Just reflect a moment, sir, how impossible it would be\r\nfor me to take these excellent goods at the absurdly low price you are\r\nasking. If you will oblige me by doubling the amount, I shall do myself\r\nthe honour of accepting them; otherwise, I cannot but feel that you are\r\nunwilling to do business with me to-day.’\r\n\r\n“‘How very funny!’ whispered T‘ang to his friends. ‘Here, now, is quite\r\na different custom from ours, where the buyer invariably tries to beat\r\ndown the seller, and the seller to run up the price of his goods as\r\nhigh as possible. This certainly looks like the ‘consideration for\r\nothers’ of which we spoke just now.’\r\n\r\n“The man at the stall here replied, ‘Your wish, sir, should be law to\r\nme, I know; but the fact is, I am already overwhelmed with shame at\r\nthe high price I have ventured to name. Besides, I do not profess to\r\nadhere rigidly to ‘marked prices,’ which is a mere trick of the trade,\r\nand consequently it should be the aim of every purchaser to make me\r\nlower my terms to the very smallest figure; you, on the contrary,\r\nare trying to raise the price to an exorbitant figure; and although\r\nI fully appreciate your kindness in that respect, I must really ask\r\nyou to seek what you require at some other establishment. It is quite\r\nimpossible for me to execute your commands.’\r\n\r\n“T‘ang was again expressing his astonishment at this extraordinary\r\nreversal of the platitudes of trade, when the would-be purchaser\r\nreplied, ‘For you, sir, to ask such a low sum for these first-class\r\ngoods, and then to turn round and accuse me of over-considering your\r\ninterests, is indeed a sad breach of etiquette. Trade could not be\r\ncarried on at all if all the advantages were on one side and the losses\r\non the other; neither am I more devoid of brains than the ordinary run\r\nof people that I should fail to understand this principle and let you\r\ncatch me in a trap.’\r\n\r\n“So they went on wrangling and jangling, the stall-keeper refusing to\r\ncharge any more and the runner insisting on paying his own price, until\r\nthe latter made a show of yielding and put down the full sum demanded\r\non the counter, but took only half the amount of goods. Of course\r\nthe stall-keeper would not consent to this, and they would both have\r\nfallen back upon their original positions had not two old gentlemen who\r\nhappened to be passing stepped aside and arranged the matter for them,\r\nby deciding that the runner was to pay the full price but to receive\r\nonly four-fifths of the goods.\r\n\r\n“T‘ang and his companions walked on in silence, meditating upon the\r\nstrange scene they had just witnessed; but they had not gone many steps\r\nwhen they came across a soldier similarly engaged in buying things at\r\nan open shop-window. He was saying, ‘When I asked the price of these\r\ngoods, you, sir, begged me to take them at my own valuation; but now\r\nthat I am willing to do so, you complain of the large sum I offer,\r\nwhereas the truth is that it is actually very much below their real\r\nvalue. Do not treat me thus unfairly.’\r\n\r\n“‘It is not for me, sir,’ replied the shopkeeper, ‘to demand a price\r\nfor my own goods; my duty is to leave that entirely to you. But the\r\nfact is, that these goods are old stock, and are not even the best of\r\ntheir kind; you would do much better at another shop. However, let us\r\nsay half what you are good enough to offer; even then I feel I shall be\r\ntaking a great deal too much. I could not think, sir, of parting with\r\nmy goods at your price.’\r\n\r\n“‘What is that you are saying, sir?’ cried the soldier. ‘Although not\r\nin the trade myself, I can tell superior from inferior articles, and\r\nam not likely to mistake one for the other. And to pay a low price for\r\na good article is simply another way of taking money out of a man’s\r\npocket.’\r\n\r\n“‘Sir,’ retorted the shopkeeper, ‘if you are such a stickler for\r\njustice as all that, let us say half the price you first mentioned, and\r\nthe goods are yours. If you object to that, I must ask you to take your\r\ncustom elsewhere. You will then find that I am not imposing on you.’\r\n\r\n“The soldier at first stuck to his text, but seeing that the shopkeeper\r\nwas not inclined to give way, he laid down the sum named and began\r\nto take his goods, picking out the very worst he could find. Here,\r\nhowever, the shopkeeper interposed, saying, ‘Excuse me, sir, but you\r\nare taking all the bad ones. It is doubtless very kind of you to leave\r\nthe best for me, but if all men were like you there would be a general\r\ncollapse of trade.’\r\n\r\n“‘Sir,’ replied the soldier, ‘as you insist on accepting only half\r\nthe value of the goods, there is no course open to me but to choose\r\ninferior articles. Besides, as a matter of fact, the best kind will\r\nnot answer my purpose so well as the second or third best; and although\r\nI fully recognise your good intentions, I must really ask to be allowed\r\nto please myself.’\r\n\r\n“‘There is no objection, sir,’ said the shopkeeper, ‘to your pleasing\r\nyourself, but low-class goods are sold at a low price, and do not\r\ncommand the same rates as superior articles.’\r\n\r\n“Thus they went on bandying arguments for a long time without coming to\r\nany definite agreement, until at last the soldier picked up the things\r\nhe had chosen and tried to make off with them. The bystanders, however,\r\nall cried shame upon him and said he was a downright cheat, so that he\r\nwas ultimately obliged to take some of the best kind and some of the\r\ninferior kind and put an end to the altercation.\r\n\r\n“A little farther on our travellers saw a countryman who had just\r\npaid the price of some purchases he had succeeded in making, and was\r\nhurrying away with them, when the shopkeeper called after him, ‘Sir!\r\nsir! you have paid me by mistake in finer silver than we are accustomed\r\nto use here, and I have to allow you a considerable discount in\r\nconsequence. Of course this is a mere trifle to a gentleman of your\r\nrank and position, but still for my own sake I must ask leave to make\r\nit all right with you.’\r\n\r\n“‘Pray don’t mention such a small matter,’ replied the countryman, ‘but\r\noblige me by putting the amount to my credit for use at a future date\r\nwhen I come again to buy some more of your excellent wares.’\r\n\r\n“‘No, no,’ answered the shopkeeper, ‘you don’t catch old birds with\r\nchaff. That trick was played upon me last year by another gentleman,\r\nand to this day I have never set eyes upon him again, though I have\r\nmade every endeavour to find out his whereabouts. As it is, I can now\r\nonly look forward to repaying him in the next life; but if I let you\r\ntake me in in the same way, why, when the next life comes and I am\r\nchanged, maybe into a horse or a donkey, I shall have quite enough to\r\ndo to find him, and your debt will go dragging on till the life after\r\nthat. No, no, there is no time like the present; hereafter I might very\r\nlikely forget what was the exact sum I owed you.’\r\n\r\n“They continued to argue the point until the countryman consented to\r\naccept a trifle as a set-off against the fineness of his silver, and\r\nwent away with his goods, the shopkeeper bawling after him as long\r\nas he was in sight that he had sold him inferior articles at a high\r\nrate, and was positively defrauding him of his money. The countryman,\r\nhowever, got clear away, and the shopkeeper returned to his grumbling\r\nat the iniquity of the age. Just then a beggar happened to pass, and so\r\nin anger at having been compelled to take more than his due he handed\r\nhim the difference. ‘Who knows,’ said he, ‘but that the present misery\r\nof this poor fellow may be retribution for overcharging people in a\r\nformer life?’\r\n\r\n“‘Ah,’ said T‘ang, when he had witnessed the finale of this little\r\ndrama, ‘truly this is the behaviour of gentlemen!’\r\n\r\n“Our travellers then fell into conversation with two\r\nrespectable-looking old men who said they were brothers, and accepted\r\ntheir invitation to go and take a cup of tea together. Their hosts\r\ntalked eagerly about China, and wished to hear many particulars of ‘the\r\nfirst nation in the world.’ Yet, while expressing their admiration\r\nfor the high literary culture of its inhabitants and their unqualified\r\nsuccesses in the arts and sciences, they did not hesitate to stigmatise\r\nas unworthy a great people certain usages which appeared to them\r\ndeserving of the utmost censure. They laughed at the superstitions of\r\nFêng-Shui, and wondered how intelligent men could be imposed upon year\r\nafter year by the mountebank professors of such baseless nonsense. ‘If\r\nit is true,’ said one of them, ‘that the selection of an auspicious day\r\nand a fitting spot for the burial of one’s father or mother is certain\r\nto bring prosperity to the survivors, how can you account for the fact\r\nthat the geomancers themselves are always a low, poverty-stricken\r\nlot? Surely they would begin by appropriating the very best positions\r\nthemselves, and so secure whatever good fortune might happen to be in\r\nwant of an owner.’\r\n\r\n“Then again with regard to bandaging women’s feet in order to reduce\r\ntheir size. ‘We can see no beauty,’ said they, ‘in such monstrosities\r\nas the feet of your ladies. Small noses are usually considered more\r\nattractive than large ones; but what would be said of a man who sliced\r\na piece off his own nose in order to reduce it within proper limits?’\r\n\r\n“And thus the hours slipped pleasantly away until it was time to bid\r\nadieu to their new friends and regain their ship.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: P‘ING SHAN LÊNG YEN]\r\n\r\nThe _Chin Ku Ch‘i Kuan_, or Marvellous Tales, Ancient and Modern, is a\r\ngreat favourite with the romance-reading Chinaman. It is a collection\r\nof forty stories said to have been written towards the close of\r\nthe Ming dynasty by the members of a society who held meetings for\r\nthat purpose. Translations of many, if not all, of these have been\r\npublished. The style is easy, very unlike that of the _P‘ing Shan Lêng\r\nYen_, a well-known novel in what would be called a high-class literary\r\nstyle, being largely made up of stilted dialogue and over-elaborated\r\nverse composed at the slightest provocation by the various characters\r\nin the story. These were P‘ing and Yen, two young students in love\r\nwith Shan and Lêng, two young poetesses who charmed even more by their\r\nliterary talent than by their fascinating beauty. On one occasion a\r\npretended poet, named Sung, who was a suitor for the hand of Miss Lêng,\r\nhad been entertained by her uncle, and after dinner the party wandered\r\nabout in the garden. Miss Lêng was summoned, and when writing materials\r\nhad been produced, as usual on such occasions, Mr. Sung was asked to\r\nfavour the company with a sonnet. “Excuse me,” he replied, “but I have\r\ntaken rather too much wine for verse-making just now.” “Why,” rejoined\r\nMiss Lêng, “it was after a gallon of wine that Li Po dashed off a\r\nhundred sonnets, and so gained a name which will live for a thousand\r\ngenerations.” “Of course I could compose,” said Mr. Sung, “even after\r\ndrinking, but I might become coarse. It is better to be fasting, and\r\nto feel quite clear in the head. Then the style is more finished, and\r\nthe verse more pleasing.” “Ts‘ao Chih,” retorted Miss Lêng, “composed a\r\nsonnet while taking only seven steps, and his fame will be remembered\r\nfor ever. Surely occasion has nothing to do with the matter.” In the\r\nmidst of Mr. Sung’s confusion, the uncle proposed that the former\r\nshould set a theme for Miss Lêng instead, to which he consented, and on\r\nlooking about him caught sight through the open window of a paper kite,\r\nwhich he forthwith suggested, hoping in his heart to completely puzzle\r\nthe sarcastic young lady. However, in the time that it takes to drink a\r\ncup of tea, she had thrown off the following lines:--\r\n\r\n  “_Cunningly made to look like a bird,\r\n  It cheats fools and little children.\r\n  It has a body of bamboo, light and thin,\r\n  And flowers painted on it, as though something wonderful.\r\n  Blown by the wind it swaggers in the sky,\r\n  Bound by a string it is unable to move.\r\n  Do not laugh at its sham feet,\r\n  If it fell, you would see only a dry and empty frame._”\r\n\r\nAll this was intended in ridicule of Mr. Sung himself and of his\r\npersonal appearance, and is a fair sample of what the reader may expect\r\nthroughout.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Erh Tou Mei_, or “Twice Flowering Plum-trees,” belongs to the\r\nsixteenth or seventeenth century, and is by an unknown author. It is\r\na novel with a purpose, being apparently designed to illustrate the\r\nbeauty of filial piety, the claims of friendship, and duty to one’s\r\nneighbour in general. Written in a simple style, with no wealth of\r\nclassical allusion to soothe the feelings of the pedant, it contains\r\nseveral dramatic scenes, and altogether forms a good panorama of\r\nChinese everyday life. Two heroes are each in love with two heroines,\r\nand just as in the _Yü Chiao Li_, each hero marries both. There is a\r\nslender thread of fact running through the tale, the action of which\r\nis placed in the eighth century, and several of the characters are\r\nactually historical. One of the four lovely heroines, in order to\r\nkeep peace between China and the Tartar tribes which are continually\r\nharrying the borders, decides to sacrifice herself on the altar of\r\npatriotism and become the bride of the Khan. The parting at the\r\nfrontier is touchingly described; but the climax is reached when,\r\non arrival at her destination, she flings herself headlong over a\r\nfrightful precipice, rather than pass into the power of the hated\r\nbarbarian, a waiting-maid being dressed up in her clothes and handed\r\nover to the unsuspecting Khan. She herself does not die. Caught upon\r\na purple cloud, she is escorted back to her own country by a bevy of\r\nadmiring angels.\r\n\r\nThere is also an effective scene, from which the title of the book\r\nis derived, when the plum trees, whose flowers had been scattered by\r\na storm of wind and rain, gave themselves up to fervent prayer. “The\r\nGarden Spirit heard their earnest supplications, and announced them\r\nto the Guardian Angel of the town, who straightway flew up to heaven\r\nand laid them at the feet of God.” The trees were then suffered to put\r\nforth new buds, and soon bloomed again, more beautiful than ever.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe production of plays was well sustained through the Ming\r\ndynasty, for the simple reason that the Drama, whether an exotic\r\nor a development within the boundaries of the Middle Kingdom, had\r\nemphatically come to stay. It had caught on, and henceforth forms\r\nthe ideal pastime of the cultured, reflective scholar, and of the\r\nlaughter-loving masses of the Chinese people.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: KAO TSÊ-CH’ÊNG]\r\n\r\nThe _P‘i Pa Chi_, or “Story of the Guitar,” stands easily at the head\r\nof the list, being ranked by some admirers as the very finest of all\r\nChinese plays. It is variously arranged in various editions under\r\ntwenty-four or forty-two scenes; and many liberties have been taken\r\nwith the text, long passages having been interpolated and many other\r\nchanges made. It was first performed in 1704, and was regarded as a\r\ngreat advance in the dramatic art upon the early plays of the Mongols.\r\nThe author’s name was KAO TSÊ-CH’ÊNG, and his hero is said to\r\nhave been taken from real life in the person of a friend who actually\r\nrose from poverty to rank and affluence. The following is an outline of\r\nthe plot.\r\n\r\nA brilliant young graduate and his beautiful wife are living, as is\r\ncustomary, with the husband’s parents. The father urges the son to go\r\nto the capital and take his final degree. “At fifteen,” says the old\r\nman, “study; at thirty, act.” The mother, however, is opposed to this\r\nplan, and declares that they cannot get along without their son. She\r\ntells a pitiful tale of another youth who went to the capital, and\r\nafter infinite suffering was appointed Master of a Workhouse, only to\r\nfind that his parents had already preceded him thither in the capacity\r\nof paupers. The young man finally decides to do his duty to the Son of\r\nHeaven, and forthwith sets off, leaving the family to the kind care of\r\na benevolent friend. He undergoes the examination, which in the play is\r\nturned into ridicule, and comes out in the coveted position of Senior\r\nClassic. The Emperor then instructs one of his Ministers to take the\r\nSenior Classic as a son-in-law; but our hero refuses, on the ground, so\r\nit is whispered, that the lady’s feet are too large. The Minister is\r\nthen compelled to put on pressure, and the marriage is solemnised, this\r\npart of the play concluding with an effective scene, in which on being\r\nasked by his new wife to sing, our hero suggests such songs as “Far\r\nfrom his True Love,” and others in a similar style. Even when he agrees\r\nto sing “The Wind through the Pines,” he drops unwittingly into “Oh for\r\nmy home once more;” and then when recalled to his senses, he relapses\r\nagain into a song about a deserted wife.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile misfortunes have overtaken the family left behind. There\r\nhas been a famine, the public granaries have been discovered to be\r\nempty instead of full, and the parents and wife have been reduced to\r\nstarvation. The wife exerts herself to the utmost, selling all her\r\njewels to buy food; and when at length, after her mother-in-law’s\r\ndeath, her father-in-law dies too, she cuts off her hair and tries\r\nto sell it in order to buy a coffin, being prevented only by the old\r\nfriend who has throughout lent what assistance he could. The next thing\r\nis to raise a tumulus over the grave. This she tries to do with her own\r\nhands, but falls asleep from fatigue. The Genius of the Hills sees her\r\nin this state, and touched by her filial devotion, summons the white\r\nmonkey of the south and the black tiger of the north, spirits who, with\r\nthe aid of their subordinates, complete the tumulus in less than no\r\ntime. On awaking, she recognises supernatural intervention, and then\r\ndetermines to start for the capital in search of her husband, against\r\nwhom she entertains very bitter feelings. She first sets to work to\r\npaint the portraits of his deceased parents, and then with these for\r\nexhibition as a means of obtaining alms, and with her guitar, she takes\r\nher departure. Before her arrival the husband has heard by a letter,\r\nforged in order to get a reward, that his father and mother are both\r\nwell, and on their way to rejoin him. He therefore goes to a temple\r\nto pray Buddha for a safe conduct, and there picks up the rolled-up\r\npictures of his father and mother which have been dropped by his wife,\r\nwho has also visited the temple to ask for alms. The picture is sent\r\nunopened to his study. And now the wife, in continuing her search,\r\naccidentally gains admission to her husband’s house, and is kindly\r\nreceived by the second wife. After a few misunderstandings the truth\r\ncomes out, and the second wife, who is in full sympathy with the first,\r\nrecommends her to step into the study and leave a note for the husband.\r\nThis note, in the shape of some uncomplimentary verses, is found by the\r\nlatter together with the pictures which have been hung up against the\r\nwall; the second wife introduces the first; there is an explanation;\r\nand the curtain, if there was such a thing in a Chinese theatre, would\r\nfall upon the final happiness of the husband and his two wives.\r\n\r\nOf course, in the above sketch of a play, which is about as long as\r\none of Shakespeare’s, a good many side-touches have been left out. Its\r\nchief beauties, according to Chinese critics, are to be found in the\r\nglorification of duty to the sovereign, of filial piety to a husband’s\r\nparents, and of accommodating behaviour on the part of the second wife\r\ntending so directly to the preservation of peace under complicated\r\ncircumstances. The forged letter is looked upon as a weak spot, as\r\nthe hero would know his father’s handwriting, and so with other\r\npoints which it has been suggested should be cut out. “But because a\r\nstork’s neck is too long,” says an editor, “you can’t very well remedy\r\nthe defect by taking a piece off.” On the other hand, the pathetic\r\ncharacter of the play gives it a high value with the Chinese; for, as\r\nwe are told in the prologue, “it is much easier to make people laugh\r\nthan cry.” And if we can believe all that is said on this score, every\r\nsuccessive generation has duly paid its tribute of tears to the _P‘i Pa\r\nChi_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nPOETRY\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HSIEH CHIN]\r\n\r\nThough the poetry of the Ming dynasty shows little falling off, in\r\npoint of mere volume, there are far fewer great poets to be found\r\nthan under the famous Houses of T‘ang and Sung. The name, however,\r\nwhich stands first in point of chronological sequence, is one which\r\nis widely known. HSIEH CHIN (1369-1415) was born when the\r\ndynasty was but a year old, and took his final degree before he had\r\npassed the age of twenty. His precocity had already gained for him the\r\nreputation of being an Inspired Boy, and, later on, the Emperor took\r\nsuch a fancy to him, that while Hsieh Chin was engaged in writing, his\r\nMajesty would often deign to hold the ink-slab. He was President of the\r\nCommission which produced the huge encyclopædia already described, but\r\nhe is now chiefly known as the author of what appears to be a didactic\r\npoem of about 150 lines, which may be picked up at any bookstall. It\r\nis necessary to say “about 150 lines,” since no two editions give\r\nidentically the same number of lines, or even the same text to each\r\nline. It is also very doubtful if Hsieh Chin actually wrote such a\r\npoem. In many editions, lines are boldly stolen from the early Han\r\npoetry and pitchforked in without rhyme or reason, thus making the\r\ntransitions even more awkward than they otherwise would be. All\r\neditors seem to be agreed upon the four opening lines, which state\r\nthat the Son of Heaven holds heroes in high esteem, that his Majesty\r\nurges all to study diligently, and that everything in this world is\r\nsecond-class, with the sole exception of book-learning. It is in fact\r\nthe old story that\r\n\r\n  “_Learning is better than house or land;\r\n  For when house and land are gone and spent,\r\n  Then learning is most excellent._”\r\n\r\nFarther on we come to four lines often quoted as enumerating the four\r\ngreatest happinesses in life, to wit,\r\n\r\n  “_A gentle rain after long drought,\r\n  Meeting an old friend in a foreign clime,\r\n  The joys of the wedding-day,\r\n  One’s name on the list of successful candidates._”\r\n\r\nThe above lines occur _à propos_ of nothing in particular, and are\r\nclosely followed in some editions by more precepts on the subject of\r\nearnest application. Then after reading that the Classics are the best\r\nfields to cultivate, we come upon four lines with a dash of real poetry\r\nin them:--\r\n\r\n  “_Man in his youth-time’s rosy glow,\r\n    The pink peach flowering in the glade....\r\n  Why, yearly, when spring breezes blow,\r\n    Does each one flush a deeper shade?_”\r\n\r\nMore injunctions to burn the midnight oil are again strangely followed\r\nby a suggestion that three cups of wine induce serenity of mind, and\r\nthat if a man is but dead drunk, all his cares disappear, which is only\r\nanother way of saying that\r\n\r\n  “_The best of life is but intoxication._”\r\n\r\nAltogether, this poem is clearly a patchwork, of which some parts may\r\nhave come from Hsieh Chin’s pen. Here is a short poem of his in defence\r\nof official venality, about which there is no doubt:--\r\n\r\n  “_In vain hands bent on sacrifice\r\n            or clasped in prayer we see;\r\n  The ways of God are not exactly\r\n            what those ways should be.\r\n  The swindler and the ruffian\r\n            lead pleasant lives enough,\r\n  While judgments overtake the good\r\n            and many a sharp rebuff.\r\n  The swaggering bully stalks along\r\n            as blithely as you please,\r\n  While those who never miss their prayers\r\n            are martyrs to disease.\r\n  And if great God Almighty fails\r\n            to keep the balance true,\r\n  What can we hope that paltry\r\n            mortal magistrates will do?_”\r\n\r\nThe writer came to a tragic end. By supporting the claim of the eldest\r\nprince to be named heir apparent, he made a lasting enemy of another\r\nson, who succeeded in getting him banished on one charge, and then\r\nimprisoned on a further charge. After four years’ confinement he was\r\nmade drunk, probably without much difficulty, and was buried under a\r\nheap of snow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Emperor who reigned between 1522 and 1566 as the eleventh of his\r\nline was not a very estimable personage, especially in the latter years\r\nof his life, when he spent vast sums over palaces and temples, and\r\nwasted most of his time in seeking after the elixir of life. In 1539\r\nhe despatched General Mao to put down a rising in Annam, and gave him\r\nan autograph poem as a send-off. The verses are considered spirited\r\nby Chinese critics, and are frequently given in collections, which\r\ncertainly would not be the case if Imperial authorship was their only\r\nclaim:--\r\n\r\n  “_Southward, in all the panoply\r\n          of cruel war arrayed,\r\n  See, our heroic general points\r\n          and waves his glittering blade!\r\n  Across the hills and streams\r\n          the lizard-drums terrific roll,\r\n  While glint of myriad banners\r\n          flashes high from pole to pole....\r\n  Go, scion of the Unicorn,\r\n          and prove thy heavenly birth,\r\n  And crush to all eternity\r\n          these insects of the earth;\r\n  And when thou com’st, a conqueror,\r\n          from those wild barbarian lands,\r\n  WE will unhitch thy war-cloak\r\n          with our own Imperial hands!_”\r\n\r\nThe courtesans of ancient and mediæval China formed a class which now\r\nseems no longer to exist. Like the _hetairæ_ of Greece, they were often\r\nhighly educated, and exercised considerable influence. Biographies of\r\nthe most famous of these ladies are in existence, extending back to the\r\nseventh century A.D. The following is an extract from that of\r\nHsieh Su-su, who flourished in the fourteenth century, and “with whom\r\nbut few of the beauties of old could compare”:--\r\n\r\n“Su-su’s beauty was of a most refined style, with a captivating\r\nsweetness of voice and grace of movement. She was a skilful artist,\r\nsweeping the paper with a few rapid touches, which produced such\r\nspeaking effects that few, even of the first rank, could hope to excel\r\nher work. She was a fine horsewoman, and could shoot from horseback\r\nwith a cross-bow. She would fire one pellet, and then a second, which\r\nwould catch up the first and smash it to atoms in mid-air. Or she would\r\nthrow a pellet on to the ground, and then grasping the cross-bow in her\r\nleft hand, with her right hand passed behind her back, she would let\r\nfly and hit it, not missing once in a hundred times. She was also very\r\nparticular about her friends, receiving no one unless by his talents he\r\nhad made some mark in the world.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHAO TS’AI-CHI--CHAO LI-HUA]\r\n\r\nThe poetical effusions, and even plays, of many of these ladies have\r\nbeen carefully preserved, and are usually published as a supplement to\r\nany dynastic collection. Here is a specimen by CHAO TS’AI-CHI\r\n(fifteenth century), of whom no biography is extant:--\r\n\r\n  “_The tide in the river beginning to rise,\r\n  Near the sad hour of parting, brings tears to our eyes;\r\n  Alas! that these furlongs of willow-strings gay\r\n  Cannot hold fast the boat that will soon be away!_”\r\n\r\nAnother specimen, by a lady named CHAO LI-HUA (sixteenth\r\ncentury), contains an attempt at a pun, which is rather lamely brought\r\nout in the translation:--\r\n\r\n  “_Your notes on paper; rare to see,\r\n    Two flying joy-birds bear;[34]\r\n  Be like the birds and fly to me,\r\n    Not like the paper, rare!_”\r\n\r\nThese examples sufficiently illustrate this small department of\r\nliterature, which, if deficient in work of real merit, at any rate\r\ncontains nothing of an indelicate character.\r\n\r\nA wild harum-scarum young man was FANG SHU-SHAO, who, like\r\nmany other Chinese poets, often took more wine than was good for him.\r\nHe was famed for his poetry, and also for his calligraphy, specimens of\r\nhis art being highly prized by collectors. In 1642, we are told, “he\r\nwas ill with his teeth;” and at length got into his coffin, which all\r\nChinese like to keep handy, and wrote a farewell to the world, resting\r\nhis paper on the edge of the coffin as he wrote. On completion of the\r\npiece he laid himself down and died. Here are the lines:--\r\n\r\n  “_An eternal home awaits me;\r\n            shall I hesitate to go?\r\n  Or struggle for a few more hours\r\n            of fleeting life below?\r\n  A home wherein the clash of arms\r\n            I can never hear again!\r\n  And shall I strive to linger\r\n            in this thorny world of pain?\r\n  The breeze will soon blow cool o’er me,\r\n            and the bright moon shine o’erhead,\r\n  When blended with the gems of earth\r\n            I lie in my last bed.\r\n  My Pen and ink shall go with me\r\n            inside my funeral hearse,\r\n  So that if I’ve leisure ‘over there’\r\n            I may soothe my soul with verse._”\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[34] Chinese note-paper is ornamented with all kinds of pictures, which\r\nsometimes cover the whole sheet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE EIGHTH\r\n\r\n_THE MANCHU DYNASTY_ (A.D. 1644-1900)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE “LIAO CHAI”--THE “HUNG LOU MÊNG”\r\n\r\n\r\nBy 1644 the glories of the great Ming dynasty had departed.\r\nMisgovernment, referred by Chinese writers to the ascendency of\r\neunuchs, had resulted in rebellion, and the rebel chief with a large\r\narmy was pressing upon the capital. On the 9th April Peking fell.\r\nDuring the previous night the Emperor, who had refused to flee, slew\r\nthe eldest Princess, commanded the Empress to commit suicide, and sent\r\nhis three sons into hiding. At dawn the bell was struck for the Court\r\nto assemble; but no one came. His Majesty then ascended the Wan Sui\r\nHill in the palace grounds, and wrote on the lapel of his robe a last\r\ndecree:--“We, poor in virtue and of contemptible personality, have\r\nincurred the wrath of God on high. My Ministers have deceived me. I am\r\nashamed to meet my ancestors; and therefore I myself take off my crown,\r\nand, with my hair covering my face, await dismemberment at the hands\r\nof the rebels. Do not hurt a single one of my people!” He then hanged\r\nhimself, as did one faithful eunuch. At this juncture the Chinese\r\ncommander-in-chief made overtures to the Manchu Tartars, who had long\r\nbeen consolidating their forces, and were already a serious menace to\r\nChina. An agreement was hurriedly entered into, and Peking was retaken.\r\nThe Manchus took possession definitively of the throne, which they had\r\nopenly claimed since 1635, and imposed the “pigtail” upon the Chinese\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nHere then was the great empire of China, bounded by the Four Seas,\r\nand stretching to the confines of the habitable earth, except for a\r\nfew barbarian islands scattered on its fringe, with its refined and\r\nscholarly people, heirs to a glorious literature more than twenty\r\ncenturies old, in the power of a wild race of herdsmen, whose title\r\nhad been established by skill in archery and horsemanship. Not much\r\nwas to be expected on behalf of the “humanities” from a people whose\r\nown written language had been composed to order so late as 1599, and\r\nwhose literary instincts had still to be developed. Yet it may be said\r\nwithout fear of contradiction that no age ever witnessed anything like\r\nthe extensive encouragement of literature and patronage of literary men\r\nexhibited under the reigns of two Emperors of this dynasty. Of this,\r\nhowever, in the next chapter.\r\n\r\nThe literature of this dynasty may be said to begin with a writer who\r\nwas after all but a mere storyteller. It has already been stated that\r\nnovels and plays are not included by the Chinese in the domain of pure\r\nliterature. Such is the rule, to which there is in practice, if not in\r\ntheory, one very notable exception.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: P‘U SUNG-LING]\r\n\r\nP‘U SUNG-LING, author of the _Liao Chai Chih I_, which may\r\nbe conveniently rendered by “Strange Stories,” was born in 1622, and\r\ntook his first degree in 1641. Though an excellent scholar and a most\r\npolished writer, he failed, as many other good men have done, to take\r\nthe higher degrees by which he had hoped to enter upon an official\r\ncareer. It is generally understood that this failure was due to neglect\r\nof the beaten track of academic study. At any rate, his disappointment\r\nwas overwhelming. All else that we have on record of P‘u Sung-ling,\r\nbesides the fact that he lived in close companionship with several\r\neminent scholars of the day, is gathered from his own words, written\r\nwhen, in 1679, he laid down his pen upon the completion of a task\r\nwhich was to raise him within a short period to a foremost rank in the\r\nChinese world of letters. The following are extracts from this record:--\r\n\r\n“Clad in wistaria, girdled with ivy,[35]--thus sang Ch‘ü Yüan in\r\nhis _Li Sao_. Of ox-headed devils and serpent gods, he of the long\r\nnails[36] never wearied to tell. Each interprets in his own way the\r\nmusic of heaven; and whether it be discord or not, depends upon\r\nantecedent causes. As for me, I cannot, with my poor autumn firefly’s\r\nlight, match myself against the hobgoblins of the age.[37] I am but\r\nthe dust in the sunbeam, a fit laughing-stock for devils.[38] For my\r\ntalents are not those of Yü Pao,[39] elegant explorer of the records of\r\nthe gods; I am rather animated by the spirit of Su Tung-p‘o, who loved\r\nto hear men speak of the supernatural. I get people to commit what\r\nthey tell me to writing, and subsequently I dress it up in the form of\r\na story; and thus in the lapse of time my friends from all quarters\r\nhave supplied me with quantities of material, which, from my habit of\r\ncollecting, has grown into a vast pile.\r\n\r\n“When the bow[40] was hung at my father’s door, he dreamed that a\r\nsickly-looking Buddhist priest, but half-covered by his stole, entered\r\nthe chamber. On one of his breasts was a round piece of plaster like a\r\n_cash_; and my father, waking from sleep, found that I, just born, had\r\na similar black patch on my body. As a child, I was thin and constantly\r\nailing, and unable to hold my own in the battle of life. Our home was\r\nchill and desolate as a monastery; and working there for my livelihood\r\nwith my pen, I was as poor as a priest with his alms-bowl. Often and\r\noften I put my hand to my head and exclaimed, ‘Surely he who sat with\r\nhis face to the wall[41] was myself in a previous state of existence;’\r\nand thus I referred my non-success in this life to the influence of a\r\ndestiny surviving from the last. I have been tossed hither and thither\r\nin the direction of the ruling wind, like a flower falling in filthy\r\nplaces; but the six paths[42] of transmigration are inscrutable indeed,\r\nand I have no right to complain. As it is, midnight finds me with an\r\nexpiring lamp, while the wind whistles mournfully without; and over my\r\ncheerless table I piece together my tales, vainly hoping to produce\r\na sequel to the _Infernal Regions_.[43] With a bumper I stimulate my\r\npen, yet I only succeed thereby in ‘venting my excited feelings,’ and\r\nas I thus commit my thoughts to writing, truly I am an object worthy\r\nof commiseration. Alas! I am but the bird that, dreading the winter\r\nfrost, finds no shelter in the tree, the autumn insect that chirps to\r\nthe moon and hugs the door for warmth. For where are they who know me?\r\nThey are ‘in the bosky grove and at the frontier pass’[44]--wrapped in\r\nan impenetrable gloom!”\r\n\r\nFor many years these “Strange Stories” circulated only in manuscript.\r\nP‘u Sung-ling, as we are told in a colophon by his grandson to the\r\nfirst edition, was too poor to meet the heavy expense of block-cutting;\r\nand it was not until so late as 1740, when the author must have been\r\nalready for some time a denizen of the dark land he so much loved\r\nto describe, that his aforesaid grandson printed and published the\r\ncollection now so universally famous. Since then many editions have\r\nbeen laid before the Chinese public, the best of which is that by Tan\r\nMing-lun, a Salt Commissioner, who flourished during the reign of Tao\r\nKuang, and who in 1842 produced, at his own expense, an excellent\r\nedition in sixteen small octavo volumes of about 160 pages each.\r\n\r\nAny reader of these stories as transferred into another language might\r\nfairly turn round and ask the why and the wherefore of the profound\r\nadmiration--to use a mild term--which is universally accorded to them\r\nby the literati of China. The answer is to be found in the incomparable\r\nstyle in which even the meanest of them is arrayed. All the elements\r\nof form which make for beauty in Chinese composition are there in\r\noverwhelming force. Terseness is pushed to its extreme limits; each\r\nparticle that can be safely dispensed with is scrupulously eliminated,\r\nand every here and there some new and original combination invests\r\nperhaps a single word with a force it could never have possessed\r\nexcept under the hands of a perfect master of his art. Add to the\r\nabove copious allusions and adaptations from a course of reading which\r\nwould seem to have been co-extensive with the whole range of Chinese\r\nliterature, a wealth of metaphor and an artistic use of figures\r\ngenerally, to which only the writings of Carlyle form an adequate\r\nparallel, and the result is a work which for purity and beauty of style\r\nis now universally accepted in China as among the best and most perfect\r\nmodels. Sometimes the story runs plainly and smoothly enough, but the\r\nnext moment we may be plunged into pages of abstruse text, the meaning\r\nof which is so involved in quotations from and allusions to the poetry\r\nor history of the past three thousand years as to be recoverable only\r\nafter diligent perusal of the commentary, and much searching in other\r\nworks of reference.\r\n\r\nPremising that, according to one editor, the intention of most\r\nof these stories is to “glorify virtue and to censure vice,” the\r\nfollowing story, entitled “The Talking Pupils,” may be taken as a fair\r\nillustration of the extent to which this pledge is redeemed:--\r\n\r\n“At Ch‘ang-an there lived a scholar named Fang Tung, who, though by no\r\nmeans destitute of ability, was a very unprincipled rake, and in the\r\nhabit of following and speaking to any woman he might chance to meet.\r\nThe day before the spring festival of Clear Weather he was strolling\r\nabout outside the city when he saw a small carriage with red curtains\r\nand an embroidered awning, followed by a crowd of waiting-maids on\r\nhorseback, one of whom was exceedingly pretty and riding on a small\r\npalfrey. Going closer to get a better view, Mr. Fang noticed that the\r\ncarriage curtain was partly open, and inside he beheld a beautifully\r\ndressed girl of about sixteen, lovely beyond anything he had ever\r\nseen. Dazzled by the sight, he could not take his eyes off her, and\r\nnow before, now behind, he followed the carriage for many a mile. By\r\nand by he heard the young lady call out to her maid, and, when the\r\nlatter came alongside, say to her, ‘Let down the screen for me. Who is\r\nthis rude fellow that keeps on staring so?’ The maid accordingly let\r\ndown the screen, and looking angrily at Mr. Fang, said to him, ‘This\r\nis the bride of the Seventh Prince in the City of Immortals going\r\nhome to see her parents, and no village girl that you should stare\r\nat her thus.’ Then taking a handful of dust she threw it at him and\r\nblinded him. He rubbed his eyes and looked round, but the carriage and\r\nhorses were gone. This frightened him, and he went off home, feeling\r\nvery uncomfortable about the eyes. He sent for a doctor to examine\r\nthem, and on the pupils was found a small film, which had increased\r\nby next morning, the eyes watering incessantly all the time. The film\r\nwent on growing, and in a few days was as thick as a _cash_. On the\r\nright pupil there came a kind of spiral, and as no medicine was of any\r\navail, the sufferer gave himself up to grief and wished for death. He\r\nthen bethought himself of repenting of his misdeeds, and hearing that\r\nthe _Kuang-ming sûtra_ could relieve misery, he got a copy and hired\r\na man to teach it to him. At first it was very tedious work, but by\r\ndegrees he became more composed, and spent every evening in a posture\r\nof devotion, telling his beads. At the end of a year he had arrived at\r\na state of perfect calm, when one day he heard a small voice, about as\r\nloud as a fly’s, calling out from his left eye, ‘It’s horridly dark\r\nin here.’ To this he heard a reply from the right eye, saying, ‘Let\r\nus go out for a stroll, and cheer ourselves up a bit.’ Then he felt\r\na wriggling in his nose which made it itch, just as if something was\r\ngoing out of each of his nostrils, and after a while he felt it again\r\nas if going the other way. Afterwards he heard a voice from one eye\r\nsay, ‘I hadn’t seen the garden for a long time; the epidendrums are all\r\nwithered and dead.’ Now Mr. Fang was very fond of these epidendrums,\r\nof which he had planted a great number, and had been accustomed to\r\nwater them himself, but since the loss of his sight he had never even\r\nalluded to them. Hearing, however, these words, he at once asked his\r\nwife why she had let the epidendrums die. She inquired how he knew\r\nthey were dead, and when he told her, she went out to see, and found\r\nthem actually withered away. They were both very much astonished at\r\nthis, and his wife proceeded to conceal herself in the room. She then\r\nobserved two tiny people, no bigger than a bean, come down from her\r\nhusband’s nose and run out of the door, where she lost sight of them.\r\nIn a little while they came back and flew up to his face, like bees\r\nor beetles seeking their nests. This went on for some days until Mr.\r\nFang heard from the left eye, ‘This roundabout road is not at all\r\nconvenient. It would be as well for us to make a door.’ To this the\r\nright eye answered, ‘My wall is too thick; it wouldn’t be at all an\r\neasy job.’ ‘I’ll try and open mine,’ said the left eye, ‘and then it\r\nwill do for both of us.’ Whereupon Mr. Fang felt a pain in his left\r\neye as if something was being split, and in a moment he found he could\r\nsee the tables and chairs in the room. He was delighted at this, and\r\ntold his wife, who examined his eye and discovered an opening in the\r\nfilm, through which she could see the black pupil shining out beneath,\r\nthe eyeball itself looking like a cracked peppercorn. By next morning\r\nthe film had disappeared, and when his eye was closely examined it was\r\nobserved to contain two pupils. The spiral on the right eye remained as\r\nbefore, and then they knew that the two pupils had taken up their abode\r\nin one eye. Further, although Mr. Fang was still blind of one eye, the\r\nsight of the other was better than that of the two together. From this\r\ntime he was more careful of his behaviour, and acquired in his part of\r\nthe country the reputation of a virtuous man.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo take another specimen, this time with a dash of humour in it. A\r\ncertain man, named Wang (_anglicè_ Smith), decided to study Tao--in\r\nother words, the black art--at a temple of the Taoist persuasion. The\r\npriest, who seems to have had a touch of Squeers in his composition,\r\nwarned Wang that he would probably not be able to stand the training;\r\nbut on the latter insisting, the priest allowed him to join the other\r\nnovices, and then sent him to chop wood. He was kept at this task so\r\nlong that, although he managed to witness several extraordinary feats\r\nof magical skill performed by the priest, he scarcely felt that he was\r\nmaking progress himself.\r\n\r\n“After a time he could not stand it any longer; and as the priest\r\ntaught him no magical arts, he determined not to wait, but went to\r\nhim and said, ‘Sir, I travelled many long miles for the benefit of\r\nyour instruction. If you will not teach me the secret of immortality,\r\nlet me, at any rate, learn some trifling trick, and thus soothe my\r\ncravings for a knowledge of your art. I have now been here two or three\r\nmonths, doing nothing but chop firewood, out in the morning and back\r\nat night, work to which I was never accustomed in my own home.’ ‘Did I\r\nnot tell you,’ replied the priest, ‘that you would never support the\r\nfatigue? To-morrow I will start you on your way home.’ ‘Sir,’ said\r\nWang, ‘I have worked for you a long time. Teach me some small art, that\r\nmy coming here may not have been wholly in vain.’ ‘What art?’ asked\r\nthe priest. ‘Well,’ answered Wang, ‘I have noticed that whenever you\r\nwalk about anywhere, walls and so on are no obstacle to you. Teach\r\nme this, and I’ll be satisfied.’ The priest laughingly assented, and\r\ntaught Wang a formula which he bade him recite. When he had done so\r\nhe told him to walk through the wall; but Wang, seeing the wall in\r\nfront of him, didn’t like to walk at it. As, however, the priest bade\r\nhim try, he walked quietly up to it and was there stopped. The priest\r\nhere called out, ‘Don’t go so slowly. Put your head down and rush at\r\nit.’ So Wang stepped back a few paces and went at it full speed; and\r\nthe wall yielding to him as he passed, in a moment he found himself\r\noutside. Delighted at this, he went in to thank the priest, who told\r\nhim to be careful in the use of his power, or otherwise there would\r\nbe no response, handing him at the same time some money for his\r\nexpenses on the way. When Wang got home, he went about bragging of his\r\nTaoist friends and his contempt for walls in general; but as his wife\r\ndisbelieved his story, he set about going through the performance as\r\nbefore. Stepping back from the wall, he rushed at it full speed with\r\nhis head down; but coming in contact with the hard bricks, finished\r\nup in a heap on the floor. His wife picked him up and found he had a\r\nbump on his forehead as big as a large egg, at which she roared with\r\nlaughter; but Wang was overwhelmed with rage and shame, and cursed the\r\nold priest for his base ingratitude.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEpisodes with a familiar ring about them are often to be found embedded\r\nin this collection. For instance:--\r\n\r\n“She then became a dense column of smoke curling up from the ground,\r\nwhen the priest took an uncorked gourd and threw it right into the\r\nmidst of the smoke. A sucking noise was heard, and the whole column was\r\ndrawn into the gourd; after which the priest corked it up closely and\r\nput it in his pouch.”\r\n\r\nOf such points the following story contains another good example:--\r\n\r\n“A countryman was one day selling his pears in the market. They were\r\nunusually sweet and fine flavoured, and the price he asked was high.\r\nA Taoist priest in rags and tatters stopped at the barrow and begged\r\none of them. The countryman told him to go away, but as he did not do\r\nso, he began to curse and swear at him. The priest said, ‘You have\r\nseveral hundred pears on your barrow; I ask for a single one, the loss\r\nof which, sir, you would not feel. Why then get angry?’ The lookers-on\r\ntold the countryman to give him an inferior one and let him go; but\r\nthis he obstinately refused to do. Thereupon the beadle of the place,\r\nfinding the commotion too great, purchased a pear and handed it to the\r\npriest. The latter received it with a bow, and turning to the crowd\r\nsaid, ‘We who have left our homes and given up all that is dear to us,\r\nare at a loss to understand selfish, niggardly conduct in others. Now\r\nI have some exquisite pears which I shall do myself the honour to put\r\nbefore you.’ Here somebody asked, ‘Since you have pears yourself why\r\ndon’t you eat those?’ ‘Because,’ replied the priest, ‘I wanted one of\r\nthese pips to grow them from.’ So saying he munched up the pear; and\r\nwhen he had finished took a pip in his hand, unstrapped a pick from\r\nhis back, and proceeded to make a hole in the ground several inches\r\ndeep, wherein he deposited the pip, filling in the earth as before. He\r\nthen asked the bystanders for a little hot water to water it with, and\r\none among them who loved a joke fetched him some boiling water from a\r\nneighbouring shop. The priest poured this over the place where he had\r\nmade the hole, and every eye was fixed upon him when sprouts were seen\r\nshooting up, and gradually growing larger and larger. By and by there\r\nwas a tree with branches sparsely covered with leaves; then flowers,\r\nand last of all fine, large, sweet-smelling pears hanging in great\r\nprofusion. These the priest picked and handed round to the assembled\r\ncrowd until all were gone, when he took his pick and hacked away for\r\na long time at the tree, finally cutting it down. This he shouldered,\r\nleaves and all, and sauntered quietly away. Now from the very beginning\r\nour friend the countryman had been amongst the crowd, straining his\r\nneck to see what was going on, and forgetting all about his business.\r\nAt the departure of the priest he turned round and discovered that\r\nevery one of his pears was gone. He then knew that those the old fellow\r\nhad been giving away so freely were really his own pears. Looking\r\nmore closely at the barrow, he also found that one of the handles was\r\nmissing, evidently having been newly cut off. Boiling with rage, he set\r\nout in pursuit of the priest, and just as he turned the corner he saw\r\nthe lost barrow-handle lying under the wall, being, in fact, the very\r\npear-tree that the priest had cut down. But there were no traces of the\r\npriest, much to the amusement of the crowd in the market-place.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere again is a scene, the latter part of which would almost justify\r\nthe belief that Mr. W. S. Gilbert was a student of Chinese, and had\r\nborrowed some of his best points in “Sweethearts” from the author of\r\nthe _Liao Chai_:--\r\n\r\n“Next day Wang strolled into the garden, which was of moderate size,\r\nwith a well-kept lawn and plenty of trees and flowers. There was also\r\nan arbour consisting of three posts with a thatched roof, quite shut in\r\non all sides by the luxuriant vegetation. Pushing his way among the\r\nflowers, Wang heard a noise from one of the trees, and looking up saw\r\nYing-ning, who at once burst out laughing and nearly fell down. ‘Don’t!\r\ndon’t!’ cried Wang, ‘you’ll fall!’ Then Ying-ning came down, giggling\r\nall the time, until, when she was near the ground, she missed her hold\r\nand tumbled down with a run. This stopped her merriment, and Wang\r\npicked her up, gently squeezing her hand as he did so. Ying-ning began\r\nlaughing again, and was obliged to lean against a tree for support,\r\nit being some time before she was able to stop. Wang waited till she\r\nhad finished, and then drew the flower out of his sleeve and handed\r\nit to her. ‘It’s dead,’ said she; ‘why do you keep it?’ ‘You dropped\r\nit, cousin, at the Feast of Lanterns,’ replied Wang, ‘and so I kept\r\nit.’ She then asked him what was his object in keeping it, to which he\r\nanswered, ‘To show my love, and that I have not forgotten you. Since\r\nthat day when we met I have been very ill from thinking so much of you,\r\nand am quite changed from what I was. But now that it is my unexpected\r\ngood fortune to meet you, I pray you have pity on me.’ ‘You needn’t\r\nmake such a fuss about a trifle,’ replied she, ‘and with your own\r\nrelatives too. I’ll give orders to supply you with a whole basketful of\r\nflowers when you go away.’ Wang told her she did not understand, and\r\nwhen she asked what it was she didn’t understand, he said, ‘I didn’t\r\ncare for the flower itself; it was the person who picked the flower.’\r\n‘Of course,’ answered she, ‘everybody cares for their relations;\r\nyou needn’t have told me that.’ ‘I wasn’t talking about ordinary\r\nrelations,’ said Wang, ‘but about husbands and wives.’ ‘What’s the\r\ndifference?’ asked Ying-ning. ‘Why,’ replied Wang, ‘husband and wife\r\nare always together.’ ‘Just what I shouldn’t like,’ cried she, ‘to be\r\nalways with anybody.’”\r\n\r\nThe pair were ultimately united, and lived happily ever afterwards,\r\nin spite of the fact that the young lady subsequently confessed that\r\nshe was the daughter of a fox, and exhibited supernatural powers. On\r\none occasion these powers stood her in good stead. Being very fond of\r\nflowers, she went so far as to pick from a neighbour’s tree.\r\n\r\n“One day the owner saw her, and gazed at her some time in rapt\r\nastonishment; however, she didn’t move, deigning only to laugh. The\r\ngentleman was much smitten with her; and when she smilingly descended\r\nthe wall on her own side, pointing all the time with her finger to a\r\nspot hard by, he thought she was making an assignation. So he presented\r\nhimself at nightfall at the same place, and sure enough Ying-ning was\r\nthere. Seizing her hand to tell his passion, he found that he was\r\ngrasping only a log of wood which stood against the wall; and the\r\nnext thing he knew was that a scorpion had stung him violently on the\r\nfinger. There was an end of his romance, except that he died of the\r\nwound during the night.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn one of the stories a visitor at a temple is much struck by a fresco\r\npainting containing the picture of a lovely girl picking flowers,\r\nand stands in rapt admiration before it. Then he feels himself borne\r\ngently into the painted wall, _à la_ “Alice through the Looking-glass,”\r\nand in the region beyond plays a part in a domestic drama, finally\r\nmarrying the heroine of the picture. But the presence of a mortal being\r\nsuspected by “a man in golden armour with a face as black as jet,” he\r\nwas glad to make his way back again; and when he rejoined a friend who\r\nhad been waiting for him, they noticed that the girl in the picture now\r\nwore her hair done up as a married woman.\r\n\r\nThere is a Rip van Winkle story, with the pathetic return of the hero\r\nto find, as the Chinese poet says--\r\n\r\n  “_City and suburb as of old,\r\n  But hearts that loved us long since cold._”\r\n\r\nThere is a sea-serpent story, and a story of a big bird or rukh; also a\r\nstory about a Jonah, who, in obedience to an order flashed by lightning\r\non the sky when their junk was about to be swamped in a storm, was\r\ntransferred by his fellow-passengers to a small boat and cut adrift. So\r\nsoon as the unfortunate victim had collected his senses and could look\r\nabout him, he found that the junk had capsized and that every soul had\r\nbeen drowned.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following is an extract from a story in which a young student named\r\nLiu falls in love with a girl named Fêng-hsien, who was the daughter\r\nof a fox, and therefore possessed of the miraculous powers which the\r\nChinese associate with that animal:--\r\n\r\n“‘But if you would really like to have something that has belonged to\r\nme,’ said she, ‘you shall.’ Whereupon she took out a mirror and gave\r\nit to him, saying, ‘Whenever you want to see me, you must look for\r\nme in your books; otherwise I shall not be visible;’ and in a moment\r\nshe had vanished. Liu went home very melancholy at heart; but when he\r\nlooked in the mirror, there was Fêng-hsien standing with her back to\r\nhim, gazing, as it were, at some one who was going away, and about a\r\nhundred paces from her. He then bethought himself of her injunctions,\r\nand settled down to his studies, refusing to receive any visitors; and\r\na few days subsequently, when he happened to look in the mirror, there\r\nwas Fêng-hsien, with her face turned towards him, and smiling in every\r\nfeature. After this, he was always taking out the mirror to look at\r\nher. However, in about a month his good resolutions began to disappear,\r\nand he once more went out to enjoy himself and waste his time as\r\nbefore. When he returned home and looked in the mirror, Fêng-hsien\r\nseemed to be crying bitterly; and the day after, when he looked at her\r\nagain, she had her back turned towards him as on the day he received\r\nthe mirror. He now knew that it was because he had neglected his\r\nstudies, and forthwith set to work again with all diligence, until in\r\na month’s time she had turned round once again. Henceforward, whenever\r\nanything interrupted his progress, Fêng-hsien’s countenance became\r\nsad; but whenever he was getting on well her sadness was changed to\r\nsmiles. Night and morning Liu would look at the mirror, regarding it\r\nquite in the light of a revered preceptor, and in three years’ time\r\nhe took his degree in triumph. ‘Now,’ cried he, ‘I shall be able to\r\nlook Fêng-hsien in the face.’ And there sure enough she was, with\r\nher delicately-pencilled arched eyebrows, and her teeth just showing\r\nbetween her lips, as happy-looking as she could be, when, all of a\r\nsudden, she seemed to speak, and Liu heard her say, ‘A pretty pair we\r\nmake, I must allow,’ and the next moment Fêng-hsien stood by his side.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere is a story of the nether world, a favourite theme with P‘u\r\nSung-ling. It illustrates the popular belief that at death a man’s\r\nsoul is summoned to Purgatory by spiritual lictors, who are even liable\r\nto make mistakes. Cataleptic fits or trances give rise to many similar\r\ntales about persons visiting the realms below and being afterwards\r\nrestored to life.\r\n\r\n“A man named Chang died suddenly, and was escorted at once by\r\ndevil-lictors into the presence of the King of Purgatory. His Majesty\r\nturned to Chang’s record of good and evil, and then, in great anger,\r\ntold the lictors they had brought the wrong man, and bade them take\r\nhim back again. As they left the judgment-hall, Chang persuaded his\r\nescort to let him have a look at Purgatory, and accordingly the devils\r\nconducted him through the nine sections, pointing out to him the Knife\r\nHill, the Sword Tree, and other objects of interest. By and by they\r\nreached a place where there was a Buddhist priest hanging suspended in\r\nthe air, head downwards, by a rope through a hole in his leg. He was\r\nshrieking with pain and longing for death; and when Chang approached,\r\nlo! he saw that it was his own brother. In great distress, he asked\r\nhis guides the reason of this punishment, and they informed him that\r\nthe priest was suffering thus for collecting subscriptions on behalf\r\nof his order, and then privately squandering the proceeds in gambling\r\nand debauchery. ‘Nor,’ added they, ‘will he escape this torment unless\r\nhe repents him of his misdeeds.’ When Chang came round, he thought his\r\nbrother was already dead, and hurried off to the Hsing-fu monastery, to\r\nwhich the latter belonged. As he went in at the door he heard a loud\r\nshrieking, and on proceeding to his brother’s room, he found him laid\r\nup with a very bad abscess in his leg, the leg itself being tied up\r\nabove him to the wall, this being, as his brother informed him, the\r\nonly bearable position in which he could lie. Chang now told him what\r\nhe had seen in Purgatory, at which the priest was so terrified that he\r\nat once gave up taking wine and meat, and devoted himself entirely to\r\nreligious exercises. In a fortnight he was well, and was known ever\r\nafterwards as a most exemplary priest.”\r\n\r\nSnatches of verse are to be found scattered about the pages of these\r\nstories, enough to give a taste of the writer’s quality without too\r\nmuch boring the reader. These lines are much admired:--\r\n\r\n  “_With wine and flowers we chase the hours\r\n    In one eternal spring;\r\n  No moon, no light, to cheer the night--\r\n    Thyself that ray must bring._”\r\n\r\nBut we have seen perhaps enough of P‘u Sung-ling. “If,” as Han\r\nYü exclaimed, “there is knowledge after death,” the profound and\r\nwidespread esteem in which this work is held by the literati of China\r\nmust indeed prove a soothing balm to the wounded spirit of the Last of\r\nthe Immortals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE HUNG LOU MÊNG]\r\n\r\nThe _Hung Lou Mêng_, conveniently but erroneously known as “The Dream\r\nof the Red Chamber,” is the work referred to already as touching the\r\nhighest point of development reached by the Chinese novel. It was\r\nprobably composed during the latter half of the seventeenth century.\r\nThe name of its author is unknown. It is usually published in 24 vols.\r\noctavo, containing 120 chapters, which average at the least 30 pages\r\neach, making a grand total of about 4000 pages. No fewer than 400\r\npersonages of more or less importance are introduced first and last\r\ninto the story, the plot of which is worked out with a completeness\r\nworthy of Fielding, while the delineation of character--of so many\r\ncharacters--recalls the best efforts of the greatest novelists of the\r\nWest. As a panorama of Chinese social life, in which almost every\r\nimaginable feature is submitted in turn to the reader, the _Hung Lou\r\nMêng_ is altogether without a rival. Reduced to its simplest terms,\r\nit is an original and effective love story, written for the most part\r\nin an easy, almost colloquial, style, full of humorous and pathetic\r\nepisodes of everyday human life, and interspersed with short poems of\r\nhigh literary finish. The opening chapters, which are intended to form\r\na link between the world of spirits and the world of mortals, belong to\r\nthe supernatural; after that the story runs smoothly along upon earthly\r\nlines, always, however, overshadowed by the near presence of spiritual\r\ninfluences. Some idea of the novel as a whole may perhaps be gathered\r\nfrom the following abstract.\r\n\r\nFour thousand six hundred and twenty-three years ago the heavens were\r\nout of repair. So the Goddess of Works set to and prepared 36,501\r\nblocks of precious jade, each 240 feet square by 120 feet in depth.\r\nOf these, however, she only used 36,500, and cast aside the single\r\nremaining block upon one of the celestial peaks.\r\n\r\nThis stone, under the process of preparation, had become as it were\r\nspiritualised. It could expand or contract. It could move. It was\r\nconscious of the existence of an external world, and it was hurt at not\r\nhaving been called upon to accomplish its divine mission.\r\n\r\nOne day a Buddhist and a Taoist priest, who happened to be passing\r\nthat way, sat down for a while to rest, and forthwith noticed the\r\ndisconsolate stone which lay there, no bigger than the pendant of a\r\nlady’s fan. “Indeed, my friend, you are not wanting in spirituality,”\r\nsaid the Buddhist priest to the stone, as he picked it up and\r\nlaughingly held it forth upon the palm of his hand. “But we cannot be\r\ncertain that you will ever prove to be of any real use; and, moreover,\r\nyou lack an inscription, without which your destiny must necessarily\r\nremain unfulfilled.” Thereupon he put the stone in his sleeve and rose\r\nto proceed on his journey.\r\n\r\n“And what, if I may ask,” inquired his companion, “do you intend to do\r\nwith the stone you are thus carrying away?”\r\n\r\n“I mean,” replied the other, “to send it down to earth, to play its\r\nallotted part in the fortunes of a certain family now anxiously\r\nexpecting its arrival. You see, when the Goddess of Works rejected\r\nthis stone, it used to fill up its time by roaming about the heavens,\r\nuntil chance brought it alongside of a lovely crimson flower. Being\r\nstruck with the great beauty of this flower, the stone remained there\r\nfor some time, tending its _protégée_ with the most loving care, and\r\ndaily moistening its roots with the choicest nectar of the sky, until\r\nat length, yielding to the influence of disinterested love, the flower\r\nchanged its form and became a most beautiful girl.\r\n\r\n“‘Dear stone,’ cried the girl, in her new-found ecstasy of life, ‘the\r\nmoisture thou hast bestowed upon me here I will repay thee in our\r\nfuture state with my tears!’”\r\n\r\nAges afterwards, another priest, in search of light, saw this self-same\r\nstone lying in its old place, but with a record inscribed upon it--a\r\nrecord of how it had not been used to repair the heavens, and how\r\nit subsequently went down into the world of mortals, with a full\r\ndescription of all it did, and saw, and heard while in that state.\r\n\r\n“Brother Stone,” said the priest, “your record is not one that deals\r\nwith the deeds of heroes among men. It does not stir us with stories\r\neither of virtuous statesmen or of deathless patriots. It seems to be\r\nbut a simple tale of the loves of maidens and youths, hardly important\r\nenough to attract the attention of the great busy world.”\r\n\r\n“Sir Priest,” replied the stone, “what you say is indeed true; and\r\nwhat is more, my poor story is adorned by no rhetorical flourish nor\r\nliterary art. Still, the world of mortals being what it is, and its\r\ncomplexion so far determined by the play of human passion, I cannot but\r\nthink that the tale here inscribed may be of some use, if only to throw\r\na further charm around the banquet hour, or to aid in dispelling those\r\nmorning clouds which gather over last night’s excess.”\r\n\r\nThereupon the priest looked once more at the stone, and saw that it\r\nbore a plain unvarnished tale of--\r\n\r\n  “_Beauty and anguish walking hand in hand\r\n  The downward slope to death_,”\r\n\r\ntelling how a woman’s artless love had developed into deep, destroying\r\npassion; and how from the thrall of a lost love one soul had been\r\nraised to a sublimer, if not a purer conception of man’s mission upon\r\nearth. He therefore copied it out from beginning to end. Here it is:--\r\n\r\nUnder a dynasty which the author leaves unnamed, two brothers had\r\ngreatly distinguished themselves by efficient service to the State. In\r\nreturn, they had been loaded with marks of Imperial favour. They had\r\nbeen created nobles of the highest rank. They had amassed wealth. The\r\npalaces assigned to them were near together in Peking, and there their\r\nimmediate descendants were enjoying the fruits of ancestral success\r\nwhen this story opens. The brothers had each a son and heir; but at the\r\ndate at which we are now, fathers and sons had all four passed away.\r\nThe wife of one of the sons only was still alive, a hale and hearty old\r\nlady of about eighty years of age. Of her children, one was a daughter.\r\nShe had married and gone away south, and _her_ daughter, Tai-yü, is the\r\nheroine of this tale. The son of the old lady’s second son and first\r\ncousin to Tai-yü is the hero, living with his grandmother. His name is\r\nPao-yü.\r\n\r\nThe two noble families were now at the very zenith of wealth and power.\r\nTheir palatial establishments were replete with every luxury. Feasting\r\nand theatricals were the order of the day, and, to crown all, Pao-yü’s\r\nsister had been chosen to be one of the seventy-two wives allotted to\r\nthe Emperor of China. No one stopped to think that human events are\r\ngoverned by an inevitable law of change. He who is mighty to-day shall\r\nbe lowly to-morrow: the rich shall be made poor, and the poor rich.\r\nOr if any one, more thoughtful than the rest, did pause awhile in\r\nknowledge of the appointments of Heaven, he was fain to hope that the\r\ncrash would not come, at any rate, in his own day.\r\n\r\nThings were in this state when Tai-yü’s mother died, and her father\r\ndecided to place his motherless daughter under the care of her\r\ngrandmother at Peking. Accompanied by her governess, the young lady set\r\nout at once for the capital, and reached her destination in safety. It\r\nis not necessary to dwell upon her beauty nor upon her genius, though\r\nboth are minutely described in the original text. Suffice it to say\r\nthat during the years which have elapsed since she first became known\r\nto the public, many brave men are said to have died for love of this\r\nentrancing heroine of fiction.\r\n\r\nTai-yü was received most kindly by all. Especially so by her\r\ngrandmother, who shed bitter tears of sorrow over the premature death\r\nof Tai-yü’s mother, her lost and favourite child. She was introduced\r\nto her aunts and cousins, and cousins and aunts, in such numbers that\r\nthe poor girl must have wondered how ever she should remember all\r\ntheir names. Then they sat down and talked. They asked her all about\r\nher mother, and how she fell ill, and what medicine she took, and how\r\nshe died and was buried, until the old grandmother wept again. “And\r\nwhat medicine do you take, my dear?” asked the old lady, seeing that\r\nTai-yü herself seemed very delicate, and carried on her clear cheek a\r\nsuspicious-looking flush.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I have done nothing ever since I could eat,” replied Tai-yü, “but\r\ntake medicine of some kind or other. I have also seen all the best\r\ndoctors, but they have not done me any particular good. When I was only\r\nthree years of age, a nasty old priest came and wanted my parents to\r\nlet me be a nun. He said it was the only way to save me.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, we will soon cure you here,” said her grandmother, smiling. “We\r\nwill make you well in no time.”\r\n\r\nTai-yü was then taken to see more of her relatives, including her aunt,\r\nthe mother of Pao-yü, who warned her against his peculiar temper, which\r\nshe said was very uncertain and variable. “What! the one with the\r\njade?” asked Tai-yü. “But we shall not be together,” she immediately\r\nadded, somewhat surprised at this rather unusual warning. “Oh yes, you\r\nwill,” said her aunt. “He is dreadfully spoilt by his grandmother, who\r\nallows him to have his own way in everything. Instead of being hard at\r\nwork, as he ought to be by now, he idles away his time with the girls,\r\nthinking only how he can enjoy himself, without any idea of making a\r\ncareer or adding fresh lustre to the family name. Beware of him, I tell\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nThe dinner-hour had now arrived, and after the meal Tai-yü was\r\nquestioned as to the progress she had made in her studies. She was\r\nalready deep in the mysteries of the Four Books, and it was agreed on\r\nall sides that she was far ahead of her cousins, when suddenly a noise\r\nwas heard outside, and in came a most elegantly dressed youth about a\r\nyear older than Tai-yü, wearing a cap lavishly adorned with pearls. His\r\nface was like the full autumn moon. His complexion like morning flowers\r\nin spring. Pencilled eyebrows, a well-cut shapely nose, and eyes\r\nlike rippling waves were among the details which went to make up an\r\nunquestionably handsome exterior. Around his neck hung a curious piece\r\nof jade; and as soon as Tai-yü became fully conscious of his presence,\r\na thrill passed through her delicate frame. She felt that somewhere or\r\nother she had looked upon that face before.\r\n\r\nPao-yü--for it was he--saluted his grandmother with great respect, and\r\nthen went off to see his mother; and while he is absent it may be as\r\nwell to say a few words about the young gentleman’s early days.\r\n\r\nPao-yü, a name which means Precious Jade, was so called because he was\r\nborn, to the great astonishment of everybody, with a small tablet of\r\njade in his mouth--a beautifully bright mirror-like tablet, bearing a\r\nlegend inscribed in the quaint old style of several thousand years ago.\r\nA family consultation resulted in a decision that this stone was some\r\ndivine talisman, the purpose of which was not for the moment clear, but\r\nwas doubtless to be revealed by and by. One thing was certain. As this\r\ntablet had come into the world with the child, so it should accompany\r\nhim through life; and accordingly Pao-yü was accustomed to wear it\r\nsuspended around his neck. The news of this singular phenomenon spread\r\nfar and wide. Even Tai-yü had heard of it long before she came to take\r\nup her abode with the family.\r\n\r\nAnd so Pao-yü grew up, a wilful, wayward boy. He was a bright, clever\r\nfellow and full of fun, but very averse to books. He declared, in fact,\r\nthat he could not read at all unless he had as fellow-students a young\r\nlady on each side of him, to keep his brain clear! And when his father\r\nbeat him, as was frequently the case, he would cry out, “Dear girl!\r\ndear girl!” all the time, in order, as he afterwards explained to his\r\ncousins, to take away the pain. Women, he argued, are made of water,\r\nwith pellucid mobile minds, while men are mostly made of mud, mere\r\nlumps of uninformed clay.\r\n\r\nBy this time he had returned from seeing his mother and was formally\r\nintroduced to Tai-yü. “Ha!” cried he, “I have seen her before\r\nsomewhere. What makes her eyes so red? Indeed, cousin Tai-yü, we shall\r\nhave to call you Cry-baby if you cry so much.” Here some reference was\r\nmade to his jade tablet, and this put him into an angry mood at once.\r\nNone of his cousins had any, he said, and he was not going to wear his\r\nany more. A family scene ensued, during which Tai-yü went off to bed\r\nand cried herself to sleep.\r\n\r\nShortly after this, Pao-yü’s mother’s sister was compelled by\r\ncircumstances to seek a residence in the capital. She brought with her\r\na daughter, Pao-ch‘ai, another cousin to Pao-yü, but about a year\r\nolder than he was; and besides receiving a warm welcome, the two were\r\ninvited to settle themselves comfortably down in the capacious family\r\nmansion of their relatives. Thus it was that destiny brought Pao-yü and\r\nhis two cousins together under the same roof.\r\n\r\nThe three soon became fast friends. Pao-ch‘ai had been carefully\r\neducated by her father, and was able to hold her own even against the\r\naccomplished Tai-yü. Pao-yü loved the society of either or both. He\r\nwas always happy so long as he had a pretty girl by his side, and was,\r\nmoreover, fascinated by the wit of these two young ladies in particular.\r\n\r\nHe had, however, occasional fits of moody depression, varied by\r\ndiscontent with his superfluous worldly surroundings. “In what am I\r\nbetter,” he would say, “than a wallowing hog? Why was I born and bred\r\namid this splendid magnificence of wealth, instead of in some coldly\r\nfurnished household where I could have enjoyed the pure communion of\r\nfriends? These silks and satins, these rich meats and choice wines, of\r\nwhat avail are they to this perishable body of mine? O wealth! O power!\r\nI curse you both, ye cankerworms of my earthly career.”\r\n\r\nAll these morbid thoughts, however, were speedily dispelled by the\r\npresence of his fair cousins, with whom, in fact, Pao-yü spent most of\r\nthe time he ought to have devoted to his books. He was always running\r\nacross to see either one or other of these young ladies, or meeting\r\nboth of them in general assembly at his grandmother’s. It was at a\r\n_tête-à-tête_ with Pao-ch‘ai that she made him show her his marvellous\r\npiece of jade, with the inscription, which she read as follows:--\r\n\r\n  “_Lose me not, forget me not,\r\n  Eternal life shall be thy lot._”\r\n\r\nThe indiscretion of a slave-girl here let Pao-yü become aware that\r\nPao-ch‘ai herself possessed a wonderful gold amulet, upon which also\r\nwere certain words inscribed; and of course Pao-yü insisted on seeing\r\nit at once. On it was written--\r\n\r\n  “_Let not this token wander from thy side,\r\n  And youth perennial shall with thee abide._”\r\n\r\nIn the middle of this interesting scene, Tai-yü walks in, and seeing\r\nhow intimately the two are engaged, “hopes she doesn’t intrude.” But\r\neven in those early days the ring of her voice betrayed symptoms of\r\nthat jealousy to which later on she succumbed. Meanwhile she almost\r\nmonopolises the society of Pao-yü, and he, on his side, finds himself\r\ndaily more and more attracted by the sprightly mischievous humour of\r\nthe beautiful Tai-yü, as compared with the quieter and more orthodox\r\nloveliness of Pao-ch‘ai. Pao-ch‘ai does not know what jealousy\r\nmeans. She too loves to bandy words, exchange verses, or puzzle over\r\nconundrums with her mercurial cousin; but she never allows her thoughts\r\nto wander towards him otherwise than is consistent with the strictest\r\nmaidenly reserve.\r\n\r\nNot so Tai-yü. She had been already for some time Pao-yü’s chief\r\ncompanion when they were joined by Pao-ch‘ai. She had come to regard\r\nthe handsome boy almost as a part of herself, though not conscious of\r\nthe fact until called upon to share his society with another. And so\r\nit was that although Pao-yü showed an open preference for herself, she\r\nstill grudged the lesser attentions he paid to Pao-ch‘ai. As often as\r\nnot these same attentions originated in an irresistible impulse to\r\ntease. Pao-yü and Tai-yü were already lovers in so far that they were\r\nalways quarrelling; the more so, that their quarrels invariably ended,\r\nas they should end, in the renewal of love. As a rule, Tai-yü fell back\r\nupon the _ultima ratio_ of all women--tears; and of course Pao-yü, who\r\nwas not by any means wanting in chivalry, had no alternative but to\r\nwipe them away. On one particular occasion, Tai-yü declared that she\r\nwould die; upon which Pao-yü said that in that case he would become a\r\nmonk and devote his life to Buddha; but in this instance it was he who\r\nshed the tears and she who had to wipe them away.\r\n\r\nAll this time Tai-yü and Pao-ch‘ai were on terms of scrupulous\r\ncourtesy. Tai-yü’s father had recently died, and her fortunes now\r\nseemed to be bound up more closely than ever with those of the family\r\nin which she lived. She had a handsome gold ornament given her to\r\nmatch Pao-ch‘ai’s amulet, and the three young people spent their days\r\ntogether, thinking only how to get most enjoyment out of every passing\r\nhour. Sometimes, however, a shade of serious thought would darken\r\nTai-yü’s moments of enforced solitude; and one day Pao-yü surprised her\r\nin a secluded part of the garden, engaged in burying flowers which had\r\nbeen blown down by the wind, while singing the following lines:--\r\n\r\n  “_Flowers fade and fly,\r\n          and flying fill the sky;\r\n  Their bloom departs, their perfume gone,\r\n          yet who stands pitying by?\r\n  And wandering threads of gossamer\r\n          on the summer-house are seen,\r\n  And falling catkins lightly dew-steeped\r\n          strike the embroidered screen.\r\n  A girl within the inner rooms,\r\n          I mourn that spring is done,\r\n  A skein of sorrow binds my heart,\r\n          and solace there is none.\r\n  I pass into the garden,\r\n          and I turn to use my hoe,\r\n  Treading o’er fallen glories\r\n          as I lightly come and go.\r\n  There are willow-sprays and flowers of elm,\r\n          and these have scent enow,\r\n  I care not if the peach and plum\r\n          are stripped from every bough.\r\n  The peach-tree and the plum-tree too\r\n          next year may bloom again,\r\n  But next year, in the inner rooms,\r\n          tell me, shall I remain?\r\n  By the third moon new fragrant nests\r\n          shall see the light of day,\r\n  New swallows flit among the beams,\r\n          each on its thoughtless way.\r\n  Next year once more they’ll seek their food\r\n          among the painted flowers,\r\n  But I may go, and beams may go,\r\n          and with them swallow bowers.\r\n  Three hundred days and sixty make\r\n          a year, and therein lurk\r\n  Daggers of wind and swords of frost\r\n          to do their cruel work.\r\n  How long will last the fair fresh flower\r\n          which bright and brighter glows?\r\n  One morn its petals float away,\r\n          but whither no one knows.\r\n  Gay blooming buds attract the eye,\r\n          faded they’re lost to sight;\r\n  Oh, let me sadly bury them\r\n          beside these steps to-night!\r\n  Alone, unseen, I seize my hoe,\r\n          with many a bitter tear;\r\n  They fall upon the naked stem\r\n          and stains of blood appear.\r\n  The night-jar now has ceased to mourn,\r\n          the dawn comes on apace,\r\n  I seize my hoe and close the gates,\r\n          leaving the burying-place;\r\n  But not till sunbeams fleck the wall\r\n          does slumber soothe my care,\r\n  The cold rain pattering on the pane\r\n          as I lie shivering there.\r\n  You wonder that with flowing tears\r\n          my youthful cheek is wet;\r\n  They partly rise from angry thoughts,\r\n          and partly from regret.\r\n  Regret--that spring comes suddenly;\r\n          anger--it cannot last,\r\n  No sound to herald its approach,\r\n          or warn us that ’tis past.\r\n  Last night within the garden\r\n          sad songs were faintly heard,\r\n  Sung, as I knew, by spirits,\r\n          spirits of flower and bird.\r\n  We cannot keep them here with us,\r\n          these much-loved birds and flowers,\r\n  They sing but for a season’s space,\r\n          and bloom a few short hours.\r\n  Ah! would that I on feathered wing\r\n          might soar aloft and fly,\r\n  With flower spirits I would seek\r\n          the confines of the sky.\r\n  But high in air\r\n  What grave is there?[45]\r\n  No, give me an embroidered bag\r\n          wherein to lay their charms,\r\n  And Mother Earth, pure Mother Earth,\r\n          shall hide them in her arms.\r\n  Thus those sweet forms which spotless came\r\n          shall spotless go again,\r\n  Nor pass besmirched with mud and filth\r\n          along some noisome drain.\r\n  Farewell, dear flowers, for ever now,\r\n          thus buried as ’twas best,\r\n  I have not yet divined when I\r\n          with you shall sink to rest.\r\n  I who can bury flowers like this\r\n          a laughing-stock shall be;\r\n  I cannot say in days to come\r\n          what hands shall bury me.\r\n  See how when spring begins to fail\r\n          each opening flow’ret fades;\r\n  So too there is a time of age\r\n          and death for beauteous maids;\r\n  And when the fleeting spring is gone,\r\n          and days of beauty o’er,\r\n  Flowers fall, and lovely maidens die,\r\n          and both are known no more._”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Pao-yü’s father had received an appointment which took him\r\naway to a distance, the consequence being that life went on at home in\r\na giddier round than usual. Nothing the old grandmother liked better\r\nthan a picnic or a banquet--feasting, in fact, of some kind, with\r\nplenty of wine and mirth. But now, somehow or other, little things\r\nwere always going wrong. In every pot of ointment the traditional fly\r\nwas sure to make its appearance; in every sparkling goblet a bitter\r\nsomething would always bubble up. Money was not so plentiful as it\r\nhad been, and there seemed to be always occurring some unforeseen\r\ndrain upon the family resources. Various members of one or other\r\nof the two grand establishments get into serious trouble with the\r\nauthorities. Murder, suicide, and robbery happen upon the premises.\r\nThe climax of prosperity had been reached and the hour of decadence\r\nhad arrived. Still all went merry as a marriage-bell, and Pao-yü and\r\nTai-yü continued the agreeable pastime of love-making. In this they\r\nwere further favoured by circumstances. Pao-ch‘ai’s mother gave up\r\nthe apartments which had been assigned to her, and went to live in\r\nlodgings in the city, of course taking Pao-ch‘ai with her. Some time\r\nprevious to this, a slave-girl had casually remarked to Pao-yü that her\r\nyoung mistress, Tai-yü, was about to leave and go back again to the\r\nsouth. Pao-yü fainted on the spot, and was straightway carried off and\r\nput to bed. He bore the departure of Pao-ch‘ai with composure. He could\r\nnot even hear of separation from his beloved Tai-yü.\r\n\r\nAnd she was already deeply in love with him. Long, long ago her\r\nfaithful slave-girl had whispered into her ear the soft possibility\r\nof union with her cousin. Day and night she thought about Pao-yü, and\r\nbitterly regretted that she had now neither father nor mother on whom\r\nshe could rely to effect the object that lay nearest to her heart.\r\nOne evening, tired out under the ravages of the great passion, she\r\nflung herself down, without undressing, upon a couch to sleep. But\r\nshe had hardly closed her eyes ere her grandmother and a whole bevy\r\nof aunts and cousins walked in to offer, as they said, their hearty\r\ncongratulations. Tai-yü was astonished, and asked what on earth their\r\ncongratulations meant; upon which it was explained to her that her\r\nfather had married again, and that her stepmother had arranged for her\r\na most eligible match, in consequence of which she was to leave for\r\nhome immediately. With floods of tears Tai-yü entreated her grandmother\r\nnot to send her away. She did not want to marry, and she would rather\r\nbecome a slave-girl at her grandmother’s feet than fall in with the\r\nscheme proposed. She exhausted every argument, and even invoked the\r\nspirit of her dead mother to plead her cause; but the old lady was\r\nobdurate, and finally went away, saying that the arrangement would\r\nhave to be carried out. Then Tai-yü saw no escape but the one last\r\nresource of all; when at that moment Pao-yü entered, and with a smile\r\non his face began to offer her _his_ congratulations too.\r\n\r\n“Thank you, cousin,” cried she, starting up and seizing him rudely by\r\nthe arm. “Now I know you for the false, fickle creature you are!”\r\n\r\n“What is the matter, dear girl?” inquired Pao-yü in amazement. “I was\r\nonly glad for your sake that you had found a lover at last.”\r\n\r\n“And what lover do you think I could ever care to find now?” rejoined\r\nTai-yü.\r\n\r\n“Well,” replied Pao-yü, “I should of course wish it to be myself. I\r\nconsider you indeed mine already; and if you think of the way I have\r\nalways behaved towards you ...”\r\n\r\n“What!” said Tai-yü, partly misunderstanding his words, “can it be you\r\nafter all? and do you really wish me to remain with you?”\r\n\r\n“You shall see with your own eyes,” answered Pao-yü, “even into the\r\ninmost recesses of my heart, and then perhaps you will believe.”\r\n\r\nThereupon he drew a knife, and plunging it into his body, ripped\r\nhimself open so as to expose his heart to view. With a shriek Tai-yü\r\ntried to stay his hand, and felt herself drenched with the flow of\r\nfresh warm blood; when suddenly Pao-yü uttered a loud groan, and crying\r\nout, “Great heaven, my heart is gone!” fell senseless to the ground.\r\n“Help! help!” screamed Tai-yü; “he is dying! he is dying!” “Wake up!\r\nwake up!” said Tai-yü’s maid; “whatever has given you nightmare like\r\nthis?”\r\n\r\nSo Tai-yü waked up and found that she had had a bad dream. But she had\r\nsomething worse than that. She had a bad illness to follow; and strange\r\nto say, Pao-yü was laid up at the same time. The doctor came and felt\r\nher pulse--both pulses, in fact--and shook his head, and drank a cup of\r\ntea, and said that Tai-yü’s vital principle wanted nourishment, which\r\nit would get out of a prescription he then and there wrote down. As to\r\nPao-yü, he was simply suffering from a fit of temporary indigestion.\r\n\r\nSo Tai-yü got better, and Pao-yü recovered his spirits. His father\r\nhad returned home, and he was once more obliged to make some show of\r\nwork, and consequently had fewer hours to spend in the society of\r\nhis cousin. He was now a young man, and the question of his marriage\r\nbegan to occupy a foremost place in the minds of his parents and\r\ngrandmother. Several names were proposed, one especially by his father;\r\nbut it was finally agreed that it was unnecessary to go far afield\r\nto secure a fitting bride. It was merely a choice between the two\r\ncharming young ladies who had already shared so much in his daily life.\r\nBut the difficulty lay precisely there. Where each was perfection it\r\nbecame invidious to choose. In another famous Chinese novel, already\r\ndescribed, a similar difficulty is got over in this way--the hero\r\nmarries both. Here, however, the family elders were distracted by rival\r\nclaims. By their gentle, winning manners, Pao-ch‘ai and Tai-yü had\r\nmade themselves equally beloved by all the inmates of these two noble\r\nhouses, from the venerable grandmother down to the meanest slave-girl.\r\nTheir beauty was of different styles, but at the bar of man’s opinion\r\neach would probably have gained an equal number of votes. Tai-yü was\r\nundoubtedly the cleverer of the two, but Pao-ch‘ai had better health;\r\nand in the judgment of those with whom the decision rested, health\r\ncarried the day. It was arranged that Pao-yü was to marry Pao-ch‘ai.\r\n\r\nThis momentous arrangement was naturally made in secret. Various\r\npreliminaries would have to be gone through before a verbal promise\r\ncould give place to formal betrothal. And it is a well-ascertained\r\nfact that secrets can only be kept by men, while this one was confided\r\nto at least a dozen women. Consequently, one night when Tai-yü was\r\nill and alone in her room, yearning for the love that had already\r\nbeen contracted away to another, she heard two slave-girls outside\r\nwhispering confidences, and fancied she caught Pao-yü’s name. She\r\nlistened again, and this time without doubt, for she heard them say\r\nthat Pao-yü was engaged to marry a lady of good family and many\r\naccomplishments. Just then a parrot called out, “Here’s your mistress:\r\npour out the tea!” which frightened the slave-girls horribly; and they\r\nforthwith separated, one of them running inside to attend upon Tai-yü\r\nherself. She finds her young mistress in a very agitated state, but\r\nTai-yü is always ailing now.\r\n\r\nThis time she was seriously ill. She ate nothing. She was racked by a\r\ndreadful cough. Even a Chinese doctor could now hardly fail to see that\r\nshe was far advanced in a decline. But none knew that the sickness of\r\nher body had originated in sickness of the heart.\r\n\r\nOne night she grew rapidly worse and worse, and lay to all appearances\r\ndying. A slave-girl ran to summon her grandmother, while several others\r\nremained in the room talking about Pao-yü and his intended marriage.\r\n“It was all off,” said one of them. “His grandmother would not agree\r\nto the young lady chosen by his father. She had already made her\r\nown choice--of another young lady who lives in the family, and of\r\nwhom we are all very fond.” The dying girl heard these words, and it\r\nthen flashed across her that after all she must herself be the bride\r\nintended for Pao-yü. “For if not I,” argued she, “who can it possibly\r\nbe?” Thereupon she rallied as it were by a supreme effort of will, and,\r\nto the great astonishment of all, called for a drink of tea. Those who\r\nhad come expecting to see her die were now glad to think that her youth\r\nmight ultimately prevail.\r\n\r\nSo Tai-yü got better once more; but only better, not well. For the\r\nsickness of the soul is not to be cured by drugs. Meanwhile, an event\r\noccurred which for the time being threw everything else into the shade.\r\n_Pao-yü lost his jade tablet._ After changing his clothes, he had\r\nforgotten to put it on, and had left it lying upon his table. But when\r\nhe sent to fetch it, it was gone. A search was instituted high and low,\r\nwithout success. The precious talisman was missing. No one dared tell\r\nhis grandmother and face the old lady’s wrath. As to Pao-yü himself,\r\nhe treated the matter lightly. Gradually, however, a change came over\r\nhis demeanour. He was often absent-minded. At other times his tongue\r\nwould run away with him, and he talked nonsense. At length he got so\r\nbad that it became imperative to do something. So his grandmother had\r\nto be told. Of course she was dreadfully upset, but she made a move in\r\nthe right direction, and offered an enormous reward for its recovery.\r\nThe result was that within a few days the reward was claimed. But\r\nin the interval the tablet seemed to have lost much of its striking\r\nbrilliancy; and a closer inspection showed it to be in reality nothing\r\nmore than a clever imitation. This was a crushing disappointment\r\nto all. Pao-yü’s illness was increasing day by day. His father had\r\nreceived another appointment in the provinces, and it was eminently\r\ndesirable that Pao-yü’s marriage should take place previous to his\r\ndeparture. The great objection to hurrying on the ceremony was that\r\nthe family were in mourning. Among other calamities which had befallen\r\nof late, the young lady in the palace had died, and her influence at\r\nCourt was gone. Still, everything considered, it was deemed advisable\r\nto solemnise the wedding without delay. Pao-yü’s father, little as\r\nhe cared for the character of his only son, had been greatly shocked\r\nat the change which he now saw. A worn, haggard face, with sunken,\r\nlack-lustre eyes; rambling, inconsequent talk--this was the heir in\r\nwhom the family hopes were centred. The old grandmother, finding that\r\ndoctors were of little avail, had even called in a fortune-teller, who\r\nsaid pretty much what he was wanted to say, viz., that Pao-yü should\r\nmarry some one with a golden destiny to help him on.\r\n\r\nSo the chief actors in the tragedy about to be enacted had to be\r\nconsulted at last. They began with Pao-ch‘ai, for various reasons;\r\nand she, like a modest, well-bred maiden, received her mother’s\r\ncommands in submissive silence. Further, from that day she ceased\r\nto mention Pao-yü’s name. With Pao-yü, however, it was a different\r\nthing altogether. His love for Tai-yü was a matter of some notoriety,\r\nespecially with the slave-girls, one of whom even went so far as to\r\ntell his mother that his heart was set upon marrying her whom the\r\nfamily had felt obliged to reject. It was therefore hardly doubtful how\r\nhe would receive the news of his betrothal to Pao-ch‘ai; and as in his\r\npresent state of health the consequences could not be ignored, it was\r\nresolved to have recourse to stratagem. So the altar was prepared, and\r\nnaught remained but to draw the bright death across the victim’s throat.\r\n\r\nIn the short time which intervened, the news was broken to Tai-yü in an\r\nexceptionally cruel manner. She heard by accident in conversation with\r\na slave-girl in the garden that Pao-yü was to marry Pao-ch‘ai. The poor\r\ngirl felt as if a thunderbolt had pierced her brain. Her whole frame\r\nquivered beneath the shock. She turned to go back to her room, but half\r\nunconsciously followed the path that led to Pao-yü’s apartments. Hardly\r\nnoticing the servants in attendance, she almost forced her way in, and\r\nstood in the presence of her cousin. He was sitting down, and he looked\r\nup and laughed a foolish laugh when he saw her enter; but he did not\r\nrise, and he did not invite her to be seated. Tai-yü sat down without\r\nbeing asked, and without a word spoken on either side. And the two\r\nsat there, and stared and leered at each other, until they both broke\r\nout into wild delirious laughter, the senseless crazy laughter of the\r\nmadhouse. “What makes you ill, cousin?” asked Tai-yü, when the first\r\nburst of their dreadful merriment had subsided. “I am in love with\r\nTai-yü,” he replied; and then they both went off into louder screams of\r\nlaughter than before.\r\n\r\nAt this point the slave-girls thought it high time to interfere, and,\r\nafter much more laughing and nodding of heads, Tai-yü was persuaded to\r\ngo away. She set off to run back to her own room, and sped along with a\r\nnewly acquired strength. But just as she was nearing the door, she was\r\nseen to fall, and the terrified slave-girl who rushed to pick her up\r\nfound her with her mouth full of blood.\r\n\r\nBy this time all formalities have been gone through and the wedding day\r\nis fixed. It is not to be a grand wedding, but of course there must be\r\na trousseau. Pao-ch‘ai sometimes weeps, she scarcely knows why; but\r\npreparations for the great event of her life leave her, fortunately,\r\nvery little leisure for reflection. Tai-yü is in bed, and, but for\r\na faithful slave-girl, alone. Nobody thinks much about her at this\r\njuncture; when the wedding is over she is to receive a double share of\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nOne morning she makes the slave-girl bring her all her poems and\r\nvarious other relics of the happy days gone by. She turns them over\r\nand over between her thin and wasted fingers until finally she\r\ncommits them all to the flames. The effort is too much for her, and\r\nthe slave-girl in despair hurries across to the grandmother’s for\r\nassistance. She finds the whole place deserted, but a moment’s thought\r\nreminds her that the old lady is doubtless with Pao-yü. So thither she\r\nmakes her way as fast as her feet can carry her, only, however, to be\r\nstill further amazed at finding the rooms shut up, and no one there.\r\nUtterly confused, and not knowing what to make of these unlooked-for\r\ncircumstances, she is about to run back to Tai-yü’s room, when to\r\nher great relief she espies a fellow-servant in the distance, who\r\nstraightway informs her that it is Pao-yü’s wedding-day, and that he\r\nhad moved into another suite of apartments. And so it was. Pao-yü had\r\njoyfully agreed to the proposition that he should marry his cousin, for\r\nhe had been skilfully given to understand that the cousin in question\r\nwas Tai-yü. And now the much wished-for hour had arrived. The veiled\r\nbride, accompanied by the very slave-girl who had long ago escorted her\r\nfrom the south, alighted from her sedan-chair at Pao-yü’s door. The\r\nwedding march was played, and the young couple proceeded to the final\r\nceremony of worship, which made them irrevocably man and wife. Then, as\r\nis customary upon such occasions, Pao-yü raised his bride’s veil. For\r\na moment he seemed as though suddenly turned into stone, as he stood\r\nthere speechless and motionless, with fixed eyes gazing upon a face he\r\nhad little expected to behold. Meanwhile, Pao-ch‘ai retired into an\r\ninner apartment; and then, for the first time, Pao-yü found his voice.\r\n\r\n“Am I dreaming?” cried he, looking round upon his assembled relatives\r\nand friends.\r\n\r\n“No, you are married,” replied several of those nearest to him. “Take\r\ncare; your father is outside. He arranged it all.”\r\n\r\n“Who was that?” said Pao-yü, with averted head, pointing in the\r\ndirection of the door through which Pao-ch‘ai had disappeared.\r\n\r\n“It was Pao-ch‘ai, your wife...”\r\n\r\n“Tai-yü, you mean; Tai-yü is my wife,” shrieked he, interrupting them;\r\n“I want Tai-yü! I want Tai-yü! Oh, bring us together, and save us\r\nboth!” Here he broke down altogether. Thick sobs choked his further\r\nutterance, until relief came in a surging flood of tears.\r\n\r\nAll this time Tai-yü was dying, dying beyond hope of recall. She knew\r\nthat the hour of release was at hand, and she lay there quietly waiting\r\nfor death. Every now and again she swallowed a teaspoonful of broth,\r\nbut gradually the light faded out of her eyes, and the slave-girl,\r\nfaithful to the last, felt that her young mistress’s fingers were\r\nrapidly growing cold. At that moment, Tai-yü’s lips were seen to move,\r\nand she was distinctly heard to say, “O Pao-yü, Pao-yü...” Those words\r\nwere her last.\r\n\r\nJust then, breaking in upon the hushed moments which succeed\r\ndissolution, sounds of far-off music were borne along upon the breeze.\r\nThe slave-girl crept stealthily to the door, and strained her ear to\r\nlisten; but she could hear nothing save the soughing of the wind as it\r\nmoaned fitfully through the trees.\r\n\r\nBut the bridegroom himself had already entered the valley of the dark\r\nshadow. Pao-yü was very ill. He raved and raved about Tai-yü, until\r\nat length Pao-ch‘ai, who had heard the news, took upon herself the\r\npainful task of telling him she was already dead. “Dead?” cried Pao-yü,\r\n“dead?” and with a loud groan he fell back upon the bed insensible. A\r\ndarkness came before his eyes, and he seemed to be transported into\r\na region which was unfamiliar to him. Looking about, he saw some one\r\nadvancing towards him, and immediately called out to the stranger to be\r\nkind enough to tell him where he was. “You are on the road to the next\r\nworld,” replied the man; “but your span of life is not yet complete,\r\nand you have no business here.” Pao-yü explained that he had come in\r\nsearch of Tai-yü, who had lately died; to which the man replied that\r\nTai-yü’s soul had already gone back to its home in the pure serene.\r\n“And if you would see her again,” added the man, “return to your duties\r\nupon earth. Fulfil your destiny there, chasten your understanding,\r\nnourish the divinity that is within you, and you may yet hope to meet\r\nher once more.” The man then flung a stone at him and struck him over\r\nthe heart, which so frightened Pao-yü that he turned to retrace his\r\nsteps. At that moment he heard himself loudly called by name; and\r\nopening his eyes, saw his mother and grandmother standing by the side\r\nof his bed.\r\n\r\nThey had thought that he was gone, and were overjoyed at seeing him\r\nreturn to life, even though it was the same life as before, clouded\r\nwith the great sorrow of unreason. For now they could always hope; and\r\nwhen they saw him daily grow stronger and stronger in bodily health,\r\nit seemed that ere long even his mental equilibrium might be restored.\r\nThe more so that he had ceased to mention Tai-yü’s name, and treated\r\nPao-ch‘ai with marked kindness and respect.\r\n\r\nAll this time the fortunes of the two grand families are sinking from\r\nbad to worse. Pao-yü’s uncle is mixed up in an act of disgraceful\r\noppression; while his father, at his new post, makes the foolish\r\nendeavour to be an honest incorrupt official. He tries to put his\r\nfoot down upon the system of bribery which prevails, but succeeds\r\nonly in getting himself recalled and impeached for maladministration\r\nof affairs. The upshot of all this is that an Imperial decree is\r\nissued confiscating the property and depriving the families of their\r\nhereditary rank. Besides this, the lineal representatives are to be\r\nbanished; and within the walls which have been so long sacred to mirth\r\nand merrymaking, consternation now reigns supreme. “O high Heaven,”\r\ncries Pao-yü’s father, as his brother and nephew start for their place\r\nof banishment, “that the fortunes of our family should fall like this!”\r\n\r\nOf all, perhaps the old grandmother felt the blow most severely.\r\nShe had lived for eighty-three years in affluence, accustomed to\r\nthe devotion of her children and the adulation of friends. But now\r\nmoney was scarce, and the voice of flattery unheard. The courtiers of\r\nprosperous days forgot to call, and even the servants deserted at their\r\nposts. And so it came about that the old lady fell ill, and within a\r\nfew days was lying upon her death-bed. She spoke a kind word to all,\r\nexcept to Pao-ch‘ai. For her she had only a sigh, that fate had linked\r\nher with a husband whose heart was buried in the grave. So she died,\r\nand there was a splendid funeral, paid for out of funds raised at the\r\npawnshop. Pao-ch‘ai appeared in white; and among the flowers which were\r\ngathered around the bier, she was unanimously pronounced to be the\r\nfairest blossom of all.\r\n\r\nThen other members of the family die, and Pao-yü relapses into a\r\ncondition as critical as ever. He is in fact at the point of death,\r\nwhen a startling announcement restores him again to consciousness. A\r\nBuddhist priest is at the outer gate, and he has brought back Pao-yü’s\r\nlost tablet of jade. There was, of course, great excitement on all\r\nsides; but the priest refused to part with the jade until he had got\r\nthe promised reward. And where now was it possible to raise such a sum\r\nas that, and at a moment’s notice? Still it was felt that the tablet\r\nmust be recovered at all costs. Pao-yü’s life depended on it, and he\r\nwas the sole hope of the family. So the priest was promised his reward,\r\nand the jade was conveyed into the sick-room. But when Pao-yü clutched\r\nit in his eager hand, he dropped it with a loud cry and fell back\r\ngasping upon the bed.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes Pao-yü’s breathing became more and more distressed,\r\nand a servant ran out to call in the priest, in the hope that something\r\nmight yet be done. The priest, however, had disappeared, and by this\r\ntime Pao-yü had ceased to breathe.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon the disunion of body and soul which mortals call\r\ndeath, the spirit of Pao-yü set off on its journey to the Infinite, led\r\nby a Buddhist priest. Just then a voice called out and said that Tai-yü\r\nwas awaiting him, and at that moment many familiar faces crowded round\r\nhim, but as he gazed at them in recognition, they changed into grinning\r\ngoblins. At length he reached a spot where there was a beautiful\r\ncrimson flower in an enclosure, so carefully tended that neither bees\r\nnor butterflies were allowed to settle upon it. It was a flower, he was\r\ntold, which had been to fulfil a mission upon earth, and had recently\r\nreturned to the Infinite. He was now taken to see Tai-yü. A bamboo\r\nscreen which hung before the entrance to a room was raised, and there\r\nbefore him stood his heart’s idol, his lost Tai-yü. Stretching forth\r\nhis hands, he was about to speak to her, when suddenly the screen was\r\nhastily dropped. The priest gave him a shove, and he fell backwards,\r\nawaking as though from a dream.\r\n\r\nOnce more he had regained a new hold upon life; once more he had\r\nemerged from the very jaws of death. This time he was a changed man.\r\nHe devoted himself to reading for the great public examination, in\r\nthe hope of securing the much coveted degree of Master of Arts.\r\nNevertheless, he talks little, and seems to care less, about the\r\nhonours and glory of this world; and what is stranger than all, he\r\nappears to have very much lost his taste for the once fascinating\r\nsociety of women. For a time he seems to be under the spell of a\r\nreligious craze, and is always arguing with Pao-ch‘ai upon the\r\nadvantages of devoting one’s life to the service of Buddha. But shortly\r\nbefore the examination he burned all the books he had collected which\r\ntreated of immortality and a future state, and concentrated every\r\nthought upon the great object before him.\r\n\r\nAt length the day comes, and Pao-yü, accompanied by a nephew who\r\nis also a candidate, prepares to enter the arena. His father was\r\naway from home. He had gone southwards to take the remains of the\r\ngrandmother and of Tai-yü back to their ancestral burying-ground. So\r\nPao-yü first goes to take leave of his mother, and she addresses to\r\nhim a few parting words, full of encouragement and hope. Then Pao-yü\r\nfalls upon his knees, and implores her pardon for all the trouble\r\nhe has caused her. “I can only trust,” he added, “that I shall\r\nnow be successful, and that you, dear mother, will be happy.” And\r\nthen amid tears and good wishes, the two young men set out for the\r\nexamination-hall, where, with several thousand other candidates, they\r\nare to remain for some time immured.\r\n\r\nThe hours and days speed apace, full of arduous effort to those within,\r\nof anxiety to those without. At last the great gates are thrown wide\r\nopen, and the vast crowd of worn-out, weary students bursts forth,\r\nto meet the equally vast crowd of eager, expectant friends. In the\r\ncrush that ensues, Pao-yü and his nephew lose sight of each other, and\r\nthe nephew reaches home first. There the feast of welcome is already\r\nspread, and the wine-kettles are put to the fire. So every now and\r\nagain somebody runs out to see if Pao-yü is not yet in sight. But the\r\ntime passes and he comes not. Fears as to his personal safety begin\r\nto be aroused, and messengers are sent out in all directions. Pao-yü\r\nis nowhere to be found. The night comes and goes. The next day and\r\nthe next day, and still no Pao-yü. He has disappeared without leaving\r\nbehind him the faintest clue to his whereabouts. Meanwhile, the list of\r\nsuccessful candidates is published, and Pao-yü’s name stands seventh\r\non the list. His nephew has the 130th place. What a triumph for the\r\nfamily, and what rapture would have been theirs, but for the mysterious\r\nabsence of Pao-yü.\r\n\r\nThus their joy was shaded by sorrow, until hope, springing eternal,\r\nwas unexpectedly revived. Pao-yü’s winning essay had attracted the\r\nattention of the Emperor, and his Majesty issued an order for the\r\nwriter to appear at Court. An Imperial order may not be lightly\r\ndisregarded; and it was fervently hoped by the family that by these\r\nmeans Pao-yü might be restored to them. This, in fact, was all that was\r\nwanting now to secure the renewed prosperity of the two ancient houses.\r\nThe tide of events had set favourably at last. Those who had been\r\nbanished to the frontier had greatly distinguished themselves against\r\nthe banditti who ravaged the country round about. There was Pao-yü’s\r\nsuccess and his nephew’s; and above all, the gracious clemency of the\r\nSon of Heaven. Free pardons were granted, confiscated estates were\r\nreturned. The two families basked again in the glow of Imperial favour.\r\nPao-ch‘ai was about to become a mother; the ancestral line might be\r\ncontinued after all. But Pao-yü, where was he? That remained a mystery\r\nstill, against which even the Emperor’s mandate proved to be of no\r\navail.\r\n\r\nIt was on his return journey that Pao-yü’s father heard of the success\r\nand disappearance of his son. Torn by conflicting emotions he hurried\r\non, in his haste to reach home and aid in unravelling the secret of\r\nPao-yü’s hiding-place. One moonlight night, his boat lay anchored\r\nalongside the shore, which a storm of the previous day had wrapped in\r\na mantle of snow. He was sitting writing at a table, when suddenly,\r\nthrough the half-open door, advancing towards him over the bow of the\r\nboat, his silhouette sharply defined against the surrounding snow, he\r\nsaw the figure of a shaven-headed Buddhist priest. The priest knelt\r\ndown, and struck his head four times upon the ground, and then,\r\nwithout a word, turned back to join two other priests who were awaiting\r\nhim. The three vanished as imperceptibly as they had come; before,\r\nindeed, the astonished father was able to realise that he had been, for\r\nthe last time, face to face with Pao-yü!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[35] Said of the bogies of the hills, in allusion to their _clothes_.\r\nHere quoted with reference to the official classes, in ridicule of the\r\ntitle under which they hold posts which, from a literary point of view,\r\nthey are totally unfit to occupy.\r\n\r\n[36] A poet of the T‘ang dynasty, whose eyebrows met, whose nails were\r\nvery long, and who could write very fast.\r\n\r\n[37] This is another hit at the ruling classes. Hsi K‘ang, the\r\ncelebrated poet, musician, and alchemist (A.D. 223-262),\r\nwas sitting one night alone, playing upon his lute, when suddenly a\r\nman with a tiny face walked in, and began to stare hard at him, the\r\nstranger’s face enlarging all the time. “I’m not going to match myself\r\nagainst a devil!” cried the musician after a few moments, and instantly\r\nblew out the light.\r\n\r\n[38] When Liu Chüan, Governor of Wu-ling, determined to relieve his\r\npoverty by trade, he saw a devil standing by his side, laughing\r\nand rubbing its hands for glee. “Poverty and wealth are matters of\r\ndestiny,” said Liu Chüan, “but to be laughed at by a devil--,” and\r\naccordingly he desisted from his intention.\r\n\r\n[39] A writer who flourished in the early part of the fourth century,\r\nand composed a work in thirty books, entitled “Supernatural Researches.”\r\n\r\n[40] The birth of a boy was formerly signalled by hanging a bow at the\r\ndoor; that of a girl, by displaying a small towel--indicative of the\r\nparts that each would hereafter play in the drama of life.\r\n\r\n[41] Alluding to the priest Dharma-nandi, who came from India to China,\r\nand tried to convert the Emperor Wu Ting of the Liang dynasty; but\r\nfailing in his attempt, he retired full of mortification to a temple\r\nat Sung-shan, where he sat for nine years before a rock, until his own\r\nimage was imprinted thereon.\r\n\r\n[42] The six _gâti_ or conditions of existence, viz., angels, men,\r\ndemons, hungry devils, brute beasts, and tortured sinners.\r\n\r\n[43] The work of a well-known writer, named Lin I-ch‘ing, who\r\nflourished during the Sung dynasty.\r\n\r\n[44] The great poet Tu Fu dreamt that his greater predecessor, Li\r\nT‘ai-po, appeared to him, “coming when the maple-grove was in darkness,\r\nand returning while the frontier pass was still obscured,”--that is,\r\nat night, when no one could see him; the meaning being that he never\r\ncame at all, and that those “who know me (P‘u Sung-ling)” are equally\r\nnon-existent.\r\n\r\n[45] These two lines are short in the original.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE EMPERORS K‘ANG HSI AND CH’IEN LUNG\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second Emperor of the Manchu dynasty, known to the world by his\r\nyear-title K‘ANG HSI, succeeded to the throne in 1662 when he\r\nwas only eight years of age, and six years later he took up the reins\r\nof government. Fairly tall and well-proportioned, he loved all manly\r\nexercises and devoted three months annually to hunting. Large bright\r\neyes lighted up his face, which was pitted with small-pox. Contemporary\r\nobservers vie in praising his wit, understanding, and liberality of\r\nmind. Indefatigable in government, he kept a careful watch on his\r\nMinisters, his love for the people leading him to prefer economy to\r\ntaxation. He was personally frugal, yet on public works he would lavish\r\nlarge sums. He patronised the Jesuits, whom he employed in surveying\r\nthe empire, in astronomy, and in casting cannon; though latterly he\r\nfound it necessary to impose restrictions on their propagandism. In\r\nspite of war and rebellion, which must have encroached seriously upon\r\nhis time, he found leisure to initiate and carry out, with the aid\r\nof the leading scholars of the day, several of the greatest literary\r\nenterprises the world has ever seen. The chief of these are (1) the\r\n_K‘ang Hsi Tzŭ Tien_, the great standard dictionary of the Chinese\r\nlanguage; (2) the _P‘ei Wên Yün Fu_, a huge concordance to all\r\nliterature, bound up in forty-four large closely-printed volumes;\r\n(3) the _P‘ien Tzŭ Lei P‘ien_, a similar work, with a different\r\narrangement, bound up in thirty-six large volumes; (4) the _Yüan Chien\r\nLei Han_, an encyclopædia, bound up in forty-four volumes; and (5)\r\nthe _T‘u Shu Chi Ch‘êng_, a profusely illustrated encyclopædia, in\r\n1628 volumes of about 200 pages to each. To the above must be added\r\na considerable collection of literary remains, in prose and verse,\r\nwhich, of course, were actually the Emperor’s own work. It cannot be\r\nsaid that any of these remains are of a high order, or are familiar\r\nto the public at large, with a single and trifling exception. The\r\nso-called Sacred Edict is known from one end of China to the other. It\r\noriginally consisted of sixteen moral maxims delivered in 1670 under\r\nthe form of an edict by the Emperor K‘ang Hsi. His Majesty himself had\r\njust reached the mature age of sixteen. He had then probably discovered\r\nthat men’s morals were no longer what they had been in the days of\r\n“ancient kings,” and with boyish earnestness he made a kindly effort\r\nto do something for the people whose welfare was destined to be for so\r\nmany years to come his chief and most absorbing care. The maxims are\r\ncommonplace enough, but for the sake of the great Emperor who loved his\r\n“children” more than himself they have been exalted into utterances\r\nalmost divine. Here are the first, seventh, and eleventh maxims, as\r\nspecimens:\r\n\r\n“Pay great attention to filial piety and to brotherly obedience, in\r\norder to give due weight to human relationships.”\r\n\r\n“Discard strange doctrines, in order to glorify the orthodox teaching.”\r\n\r\n“Educate your sons and younger brothers, in order to hinder them from\r\ndoing what is wrong.”\r\n\r\nK‘ang Hsi died in 1722, after completing a full cycle of sixty years\r\nas occupant of the Dragon Throne. His son and successor, Yung Chêng,\r\ncaused one hundred picked scholars to submit essays enlarging upon the\r\nmaxims of his father, and of these the sixteen best were chosen, and in\r\n1724 it was enacted that they should be publicly read to the people on\r\nthe 1st and 15th of each month in every city and town in the empire.\r\nThis law is still in force. Subsequently, the sixteen essays were\r\nparaphrased into easy colloquial; and now the maxims, the essays, and\r\nthe paraphrase, together make up a volume which may be roughly said to\r\ncontain the whole duty of man.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CH’IEN LUNG]\r\n\r\nIn 1735 the Emperor Yung Chêng died, and was succeeded by his fourth\r\nson, who reigned as CH’IEN LUNG. An able ruler, with an\r\ninsatiable thirst for knowledge, and an indefatigable administrator, he\r\nrivals his grandfather’s fame as a sovereign and a patron of letters.\r\nNew editions of important historical works and of encyclopædias were\r\nissued by Imperial order, and under the superintendence of the Emperor\r\nhimself. In 1772 there was a general search for all literary works\r\nworthy of preservation, and ten years later a voluminous collection of\r\nthese was published, embracing many rare books taken from the great\r\nencyclopædia of the Emperor Yung Lo. A descriptive catalogue of the\r\nImperial Library, containing 3460 works arranged under the four heads\r\nof Classics, History, Philosophy, and General Literature, was drawn\r\nup in 1772-1790. It gives the history of each work, which is also\r\ncriticised. The vastness of this catalogue led to the publication of\r\nan abridgment, which omits all works not actually preserved in the\r\nLibrary. The personal writings of this Emperor are very voluminous.\r\nThey consist of a general collection containing a variety of notes on\r\ncurrent or ancient topics, prefaces to books, and the like, and also of\r\na collection of poems. Of these last, those produced between 1736 and\r\n1783 were published, and reached the almost incredible total of 33,950\r\nseparate pieces. It need hardly be added that nearly all are very\r\nshort. Even thus the output must be considered a record, apart from the\r\nfact that during the reign there was a plentiful supply both of war\r\nand rebellion. Burmah and Nepaul were forced to pay tribute; Chinese\r\nsupremacy was established in Tibet; and Kuldja and Kashgaria were added\r\nto the empire. In 1795, on completing a cycle of sixty years of power,\r\nthe Emperor abdicated in favour of his son, and three years later he\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty’s poetry, though artificially correct, was mediocre enough.\r\nThe following stanza, “On Hearing the Cicada,” is a good example,\r\nconforming as it does to all the rules of versification, but wanting in\r\nthat one feature which makes the “stop-short” what it is, viz., that\r\n“although the words end, the sense still goes on”:--\r\n\r\n  “_The season is a month behind\r\n            in this land of northern breeze,\r\n  When first I hear the harsh cicada\r\n            shrieking through the trees.\r\n  I look, but cannot mark its form\r\n            amid the foliage fair,--\r\n  Naught but a flash of shadow\r\n            which goes flitting here and there._”\r\n\r\nHere, instead of being carried away into some suggested train of\r\nthought, the reader is fairly entitled to ask “What then?”\r\n\r\nThe following is a somewhat more spirited production. It is a song\r\nwritten by Ch‘ien Lung, to be inserted and sung in a play entitled\r\n“Picking up Gold,” by a beggar who is fortunate enough to stumble\r\nacross a large nugget:--\r\n\r\n  “_A brimless cap of felt stuck on my head;\r\n  No coat,--a myriad-patchwork quilt instead;\r\n  In my hand a bamboo staff;\r\n  Hempen sandals on my feet;\r\n  As I slouch along the street,\r\n  ‘Pity the poor beggar,’ to the passers-by I call,\r\n  Hoping to obtain broken food and dregs of wine.\r\n  Then when night’s dark shadows fall,\r\n  Oh merrily, Oh merrily I laugh,\r\n  Drinking myself to sleep, sheltered in some old shrine._\r\n\r\n  _Black, black, the clouds close round on every side;\r\n  White, white, the gossamer flakes fly far and wide.\r\n  Ai-yah! is’t jade that sudden decks the eaves?\r\n  With silver tiles meseems the streets are laid.\r\n  Oh, in what glorious garb Nature’s arrayed,\r\n  Displaying fairy features on a lovely face!\r\n  But stay! the night is drawing on apace;\r\n  Nothing remains my homeward track to guide;\r\n  See how the feathered snow weighs down the palm-tree leaves!_\r\n\r\n  _I wag my head and clap my hands, ha! ha!\r\n  I clap my hands and wag my head, ha! ha!\r\n  There in the drift a lump half-sunken lies;\r\n  The beggar’s luck has turned up trumps at last!\r\n  O gold!--for thee dear relatives will part,\r\n  Dear friends forget their hours of friendship past,\r\n  Husband and wife tear at each other’s heart,\r\n  Father and son sever life’s closest ties;\r\n  For thee, the ignoble thief all rule and law defies._\r\n\r\n  _What men of this world most adore is gold;\r\n  The devils deep in hell the dross adore;\r\n  Where gold is there the gods are in its wake.\r\n  Now shall I never more produce the snake;\r\n  Stand begging where the cross-roads meet no more;\r\n  Or shiver me to sleep in the rush hut, dank and cold;\r\n  Or lean against the rich or poor man’s door.\r\n  Away my yellow bowl, my earthen jar!\r\n  See, thus I rend my pouch and hurl my gourd afar!_\r\n\r\n  _An official hat and girdle I shall wear,\r\n  And this shrunk shank in boots with pipeclayed soles encase;\r\n  On fête and holiday how jovial I shall be,\r\n  Joining my friends in the tavern or the tea-shop o’er their tea;\r\n  Swagger, swagger, swagger, with such an air and grace.\r\n  Sometimes a sleek steed my ‘Excellence’ will bear;\r\n  Or in a sedan I shall ride at ease,\r\n  One servant with my hat-box close behind the chair,\r\n  While another on his shoulders carries my valise._”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nCLASSICAL AND MISCELLANEOUS LITERATURE--POETRY\r\n\r\n\r\nForemost among the scholars of the present dynasty stands the name of\r\nKU CHIANG (1612-1681). Remaining faithful to the Mings after\r\ntheir final downfall, he changed his name to Ku Yen-wu, and for a long\r\ntime wandered about the country in disguise. He declined to serve under\r\nthe Manchus, and supported himself by farming. A profound student, it\r\nis recorded that in his wanderings he always carried about with him\r\nseveral horse-loads of books to consult whenever his memory might be at\r\nfault. His writings on the Classics, history, topography, and poetry\r\nare still highly esteemed. To foreigners he is best known as the author\r\nof the _Jih Chih Lu_, which contains his notes, chiefly on the Classics\r\nand history, gathered during a course of reading which extended over\r\nthirty years. He also wrote many works upon the ancient sounds and\r\nrhymes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCHU YUNG-SHUN (1617-1689) was delicate as a child, and his mother\r\nmade him practise the Taoist art of prolonging life indefinitely,\r\nwhich seems to be nothing more than a system of regular breathing\r\nwith deep inspirations. He was a native of a town in Kiangsu, at the\r\nsack of which, by the conquering Tartars, his father perished rather\r\nthan submit to the new dynasty. In consequence of his father’s death\r\nhe steadily declined to enter upon a public career, and gave up his\r\nlife to study and teaching. He was the author of commentaries upon\r\nthe Great Learning and the Doctrine of the Mean, and of other works;\r\nbut none of these is so famous as his Family Maxims, a little book\r\nwhich, on account of the author’s name, has often been attributed to\r\nthe great commentator Chu Hsi. The piquancy of these maxims disappears\r\nin translation, owing as they do much more to literary form than to\r\nsubject-matter. Here are two specimens:--\r\n\r\n“Forget the good deeds you have done; remember the kindnesses you have\r\nreceived.”\r\n\r\n“Mind your own business, follow out your destiny, live in accord with\r\nthe age, and leave the rest to God. He who can do this is near indeed.”\r\n\r\nHis own favourite saying was--\r\n\r\n“To know what ought to be known, and to do what ought to be done, that\r\nis enough. There is no time for anything else.”\r\n\r\nThree days before his death he struggled into the ancestral hall, and\r\nthere before the family tablets called the spirits of his forefathers\r\nto witness that he had never injured them by word or deed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LAN TING-YÜAN]\r\n\r\nLAN TING-YÜAN (1680-1733), better known as Lan Lu-chou,\r\ndevoted himself as a youth to poetry, literature, and political\r\neconomy. He accompanied his brother to Formosa as military secretary,\r\nand his account of the expedition attracted public attention.\r\nRecommended to the Emperor, he became magistrate of P‘u-lin, and\r\ndistinguished himself as much by his just and incorrupt administration\r\nas by his literary abilities. He managed, however, to make enemies\r\namong his superior officers, and within three years he was impeached\r\nfor insubordination and thrown into prison. His case was subsequently\r\nlaid before the Emperor, who not only set him free, but appointed him\r\nto be Prefect at Canton, bestowing upon him at the same time some\r\nvaluable medicine, an autograph copy of verses, a sable robe, some\r\njoss-stick, and other coveted marks of Imperial favour. But all was in\r\nvain. He died of a broken heart one month after taking up his post.\r\nHis complete works have been published in twenty small octavo volumes,\r\nof which works perhaps the best known of all is a treatise on the\r\nproper training of women, which fills two of the above volumes. This is\r\ndivided under four heads, namely, Virtue, Speech, Personal Appearance,\r\nand Duty, an extended education in the intellectual sense not coming\r\nwithin the writer’s purview. The chapters are short, and many of them\r\nare introduced by some ancient aphorism, forming a convenient peg upon\r\nwhich to hang a moral lesson, copious extracts being made from the work\r\nof the Lady Pan of the Han dynasty. A few lines from his preface may be\r\ninteresting:--\r\n\r\n“Good government of the empire depends upon morals; correctness of\r\nmorals depends upon right ordering of the family; and right ordering\r\nof the family depends upon the wife.... If the curtain which divides\r\nthe men from the women is too thin to keep them apart, misfortune will\r\ncome to the family and to the State. Purification of morals, from the\r\ntime of the creation until now, has always come from women. Women are\r\nnot all alike; some are good and some are bad. For bringing them to a\r\nproper uniformity there is nothing like education. In old days both\r\nboys and girls were educated ... but now the books used no longer\r\nexist, and we know not the details of the system.... The education\r\nof a woman is not like that of her husband, which may be said to\r\ncontinue daily all through life. For he can always take up a classic\r\nor a history, or familiarise himself with the works of miscellaneous\r\nwriters; whereas a woman’s education does not extend beyond ten years,\r\nafter which she takes upon herself the manifold responsibilities of a\r\nhousehold. She is then no longer able to give her undivided attention\r\nto books, and cannot investigate thoroughly, the result being that\r\nher learning is not sufficiently extensive to enable her to grasp\r\nprinciples. She is, as it were, carried away upon a flood, without hope\r\nof return, and it is difficult for her to make any use of the knowledge\r\nshe has acquired. Surely then a work on the education of women is much\r\nto be desired.”\r\n\r\nThis is how one phase of female virtue is illustrated by anecdote:--\r\n\r\n“A man having been killed in a brawl, two brothers were arrested for\r\nthe murder and brought to trial. Each one swore that he personally\r\nwas the murderer, and that the other was innocent. The judge was thus\r\nunable to decide the case, and referred it to the Prince. The Prince\r\nbade him summon their mother, and ask which of them had done the deed.\r\n‘Punish the younger,’ she replied through a flood of tears. ‘People\r\nare usually more fond of the younger,’ observed the judge; ‘how is it\r\nyou wish me to punish him?’ ‘He is my own child,’ answered the woman;\r\n‘the elder is the son of my husband’s first wife. When my husband died\r\nhe begged me to take care of the boy, and I promised I would. If now I\r\nwere to let the elder be punished while the younger escaped, I should\r\nbe only gratifying my private feelings and wronging the dead. I have\r\nno alternative.’ And she wept on until her clothes were drenched with\r\ntears. Meanwhile the judge reported to the Prince, and the latter,\r\nastonished at her magnanimity, pardoned both the accused.”\r\n\r\nTwo more of the above twenty volumes are devoted to the most remarkable\r\nof the criminal cases tried by him during his short magisterial career.\r\nAn extract from the preface (1729) to his complete works, penned by an\r\nardent admirer, will give an idea of the estimation in which these are\r\nheld:--\r\n\r\n“My master’s judicial capacity was of a remarkably high order, as\r\nthough the mantle of Pao Hsiao-su[46] had descended upon him. In very\r\ndifficult cases he would investigate dispassionately and calmly,\r\nappearing to possess some unusual method for worming out the truth; so\r\nthat the most crafty lawyers and the most experienced scoundrels, whom\r\nno logic could entangle and no pains intimidate, upon being brought\r\nbefore him, found themselves deserted by their former cunning, and\r\nconfessed readily without waiting for the application of torture.\r\nI, indeed, have often wondered how it is that torture is brought\r\ninto requisition so much in judicial investigations. For, under the\r\ninfluence of the ‘three wooden instruments,’ what evidence is there\r\nwhich cannot be elicited?--to say nothing of the danger of a mistake\r\nand the unutterable injury thus inflicted upon the departed spirits\r\nin the realms below. Now, my master, in investigating and deciding\r\ncases, was fearful only lest his people should not obtain a full and\r\nfair hearing; he, therefore, argued each point with them quietly and\r\nkindly until they were thoroughly committed to a certain position, with\r\nno possibility of backing out, and then he decided the case upon its\r\nmerits as thus set forth. By such means, those who were bambooed had no\r\ncause for complaint, while those who were condemned to die died without\r\nresenting their sentence; the people were unable to deceive him, and\r\nthey did not even venture to make the attempt. Thus did he carry out\r\nthe Confucian doctrine of respecting popular feeling;[47] and were all\r\njudicial officers to decide cases in the same careful and impartial\r\nmanner, there would not be a single injured suitor under the canopy of\r\nheaven.”\r\n\r\nThe following is a specimen case dealing with the evil effects of\r\nsuperstitious doctrines:--\r\n\r\n“The people of the Ch‘ao-yang district are great on bogies, and love\r\nto talk of spirits and Buddhas. The gentry and their wives devote\r\nthemselves to Ta Tien, but the women generally of the neighbourhood\r\nflock in crowds to the temples to burn incense and adore Buddha,\r\nforming an unbroken string along the road. Hence, much ghostly and\r\nsupernatural nonsense gets spread about; and hence it was that the\r\nHou-t‘ien sect came to flourish. I know nothing of the origin of this\r\nsect. It was started amongst the Ch‘ao-yang people by two men, named\r\nYen and Chou respectively, who said that they had been instructed by\r\na white-bearded Immortal, and who, when an attempt to arrest them was\r\nmade by a predecessor in office, absconded with their families and\r\nremained in concealment. By and by, however, they came back, calling\r\nthemselves the White Lily or the White Aspen sect. I imagine that\r\nWhite Lily was the real designation, the alteration in name being\r\nsimply made to deceive. Their ‘goddess’ was Yen’s own wife, and she\r\npretended to be able to summon wind and bring down rain, enslave\r\nbogies and exorcise spirits, being assisted in her performances by\r\nher paramour, a man named Hu, who called himself the Immortal of\r\nPencil Peak. He used to aid in writing out charms, spirting water,\r\ncuring diseases, and praying for heirs; and he could enable widows\r\nto hold converse with their departed husbands. The whole district\r\nwas taken in by these people, and went quite mad about them, people\r\ntravelling from afar to worship them as spiritual guides, and, with\r\nmany offerings of money, meats, and wines, enrolling themselves as\r\ntheir humble disciples, until one would have said it was market-day in\r\nthe neighbourhood. I heard of their doings one day as I was returning\r\nfrom the prefectural city. They had already established themselves\r\nin a large building to the north of the district; they had opened a\r\npreaching-hall, collected several hundred persons together, and for\r\nthe two previous days had been availing themselves of the services of\r\nsome play-actors to sing and perform at their banquets. I immediately\r\nsent off constables to arrest them; but the constables were afraid\r\nof incurring the displeasure of the spirits and being seized by the\r\nsoldiers of the infernal regions, while so much protection was afforded\r\nby various families of wealth and position that the guilty parties\r\nsucceeded in preventing the arrest of a single one of their number.\r\nTherefore I proceeded in person to their establishment, knocked at\r\nthe door, and seized the goddess, whom I subjected to a searching\r\nexamination as to the whereabouts of her accomplices; but the interior\r\nof the place being, as it was, a perfect maze of passages ramifying in\r\nevery direction, when I seized a torch and made my way along, even if\r\nI did stumble up against any one, they were gone in a moment before I\r\nhad time to see where. It was a veritable nest of secret villany, and\r\none which I felt ought to be searched to the last corner. Accordingly,\r\nfrom the goddess’s bed in a dark and out-of-the-way chamber I dragged\r\nforth some ten or a dozen men; while out of the Immortal’s bedroom I\r\nbrought a wooden seal of office belonging to the Lady of the Moon, also\r\na copy of their magic ritual, a quantity of soporifics, wigs, clothes,\r\nand ornaments, of the uses of which I was then totally ignorant. I\r\nfurther made a great effort to secure the person of the Immortal\r\nhimself; and when his friends and rich supporters saw the game was up,\r\nthey surrendered him over to justice. At his examination he comported\r\nhimself in a very singular manner, such being indeed the chief means\r\nupon which he relied, besides the soporifics and fine dresses, to\r\ndeceive the eyes and ears of the public. As to his credulous dupes,\r\nmale and female, when they heard the name of the Lady of the Moon they\r\nwould be at first somewhat scared; but by and by, seeing that the\r\ngoddess was certainly a woman, they would begin to regain courage,\r\nwhile the Immortal himself, with his hair dressed out and his face\r\npowdered and his skirts fluttering about, hovered round the goddess,\r\nand assuming all the airs and graces of a supernatural beauty, soon\r\nconvinced the spectators that he was really the Lady of the Moon, and\r\nquite put them off the scent as to his real sex. Adjourning now to one\r\nof the more remote apartments, there would follow worship of Maitrêya\r\nBuddha, accompanied by the recital of some _sûtra_; after which\r\nsoporific incense would be lighted, and the victims be thrown into\r\na deep sleep. This soporific, or ‘soul confuser,’ as it is otherwise\r\ncalled, makes people feel tired and sleepy; they are recovered by\r\nmeans of a charm and a draught of cold water. The promised heirs and\r\nthe interviews with deceased husbands are all supposed to be brought\r\nabout during the period of trance--for which scandalous impostures\r\nthe heads of these villains hung up in the streets were scarcely a\r\nsufficient punishment. However, reflecting that it would be a great\r\ngrievance to the people were any of them to find themselves mixed\r\nup in such a case just after a bad harvest, and also that among the\r\nlarge number who had become affiliated to this society there would be\r\nfound many old and respectable families, I determined on a plan which\r\nwould put an end to the affair without any troublesome _esclandre_.\r\nI burnt all the depositions in which names were given, and took no\r\nfurther steps against the persons named. I ordered the goddess and her\r\nparamour to receive their full complement of blows (viz., one hundred),\r\nand to be punished with the heavy _cangue_; and, placing them at the\r\nyamên gate, I let the people rail and curse at them, tear their flesh\r\nand break their heads, until they passed together into their boasted\r\nParadise. The husband and some ten others of the gang were placed in\r\nthe _cangue_, bambooed, or punished in some way; and as for the rest,\r\nthey were allowed to escape with this one more chance to turn over\r\na new leaf. I confiscated the building, destroyed its disgraceful\r\nhiding-places, changed the whole appearance of the place, and made\r\nit into a literary institution to be dedicated to five famous heroes\r\nof literature. I cleansed and purified it from all taint, and on the\r\n1st and 15th of each moon I would, when at leisure, indulge with the\r\nscholars of the district in literary recreations. I formed, in fact, a\r\nliterary club; and, leasing a plot of ground for cultivation, devoted\r\nthe returns therefrom to the annual Confucian demonstrations and to the\r\npayment of a regular professor. Thus the true doctrine was caused to\r\nflourish, and these supernatural doings to disappear from the scene;\r\nthe public tone was elevated, and the morality of the place vastly\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\n“When the Brigadier-General and the Lieutenant-Governor heard what had\r\nbeen done, they very much commended my action, saying: ‘Had this sect\r\nnot been rooted out, the evil results would have been dire indeed; and\r\nhad you reported the case in the usual way, praying for the execution\r\nof these criminals, your merit would undoubtedly have been great; but\r\nnow, without selfish regard to your own interests, you have shown\r\nyourself unwilling to hunt down more victims than necessary, or to\r\nexpose those doings in such a manner as to lead to the suicide of the\r\npersons implicated. Such care for the fair fame of so many people is\r\ndeserving of all praise.’”\r\n\r\nAlthough not yet of the same national importance as at the present day,\r\nit was still impossible that the foreign question should have escaped\r\nthe notice of such an observant man as Lan Ting-yüan. He flourished at\r\na time when the spread of the Roman Catholic religion was giving just\r\ngrounds for apprehension to thoughtful Chinese statesmen. Accordingly,\r\nwe find amongst his collected works two short notices devoted to a\r\nconsideration of trade and general intercourse with the various nations\r\nof barbarians. They are interesting as the untrammelled views of\r\nthe greatest living Chinese scholar of the date at which they were\r\nwritten, namely, in 1732. The following is one of these notices:--\r\n\r\n“To allow the barbarians to settle at Canton was a mistake. Ever since\r\nMacao was given over, in the reign of Chia Ching (1522-1567) of the\r\nMing dynasty, to the red-haired barbarians, all manner of nations\r\nhave continued without ceasing to flock thither. They build forts and\r\nfortifications and dense settlements of houses. Their descendants will\r\novershadow the land, and all the country beyond Hsiang-shan will become\r\na kingdom of devils. ‘Red-haired’ is a general term for the barbarians\r\nof the western islands. Amongst them there are the Dutch, French,\r\nSpaniards, Portuguese, English, and Yü-sŭ-la [? Islam], all of which\r\nnations are horribly fierce. Wherever they go they spy around with a\r\nview to seize on other people’s territory. There was Singapore, which\r\nwas originally a Malay country; the red-haired barbarians went there\r\nto trade, and by and by seized it for an emporium of their own. So\r\nwith the Philippines, which were colonised by the Malays; because the\r\nRoman Catholic religion was practised there, the Western foreigners\r\nappropriated it in like manner for their own. The Catholic religion is\r\nnow spreading over China. In Hupeh, Hunan, Honan, Kiangsi, Fuhkien, and\r\nKuangsi, there are very few places whither it has not reached. In the\r\nfirst year of the Emperor Yung Chêng [1736], the Viceroy of Fuhkien,\r\nMan Pao, complained that the Western foreigners were preaching their\r\nreligion and tampering with the people, to the great detriment of the\r\nlocalities in question; and he petitioned that the Roman Catholic\r\nchapels in the various provinces might be turned into lecture-rooms\r\nand schools, and that all Western foreigners might be sent to Macao,\r\nto wait until an opportunity should present itself of sending them\r\nback to their own countries. However, the Viceroy of Kuangtung, out of\r\nmistaken kindness, memorialised the Throne that such of the barbarians\r\nas were old or sick and unwilling to go away might be permitted to\r\nremain in the Roman Catholic establishment at Canton, on the condition\r\nthat if they proselytised, spread their creed, or chaunted their sacred\r\nbooks, they were at once to be punished and sent away. The scheme was\r\nan excellent one, but what were the results of it? At present more\r\nthan 10,000 men have joined the Catholic chapel at Canton, and there\r\nis also a department for women, where they have similarly got together\r\nabout 2000. This is a great insult to China, and seriously injures\r\nour national traditions, enough to make every man of feeling grind\r\nhis teeth with rage. The case by no means admits of ‘teaching before\r\npunishing.’\r\n\r\n“Now these traders come this immense distance with the object of making\r\nmoney. What then is their idea in paying away vast sums in order to\r\nattract people to their faith? Thousands upon thousands they get to\r\njoin them, not being satisfied until they have bought up the whole\r\nprovince. Is it possible to shut one’s eyes and stop one’s ears,\r\npretending to know nothing about it and making no inquiries whatever?\r\nThere is an old saying among the people--‘Take things in time. A\r\nlittle stream, if not stopped, may become a great river.’ How much\r\nmore precaution is needed, then, when there is a general inundation\r\nand men’s hearts are restless and disturbed? In Canton the converts to\r\nCatholicism are very numerous; those in Macao are in an inexpugnable\r\nfortress. There is a constant interchange of arms between the two, and\r\nif any trouble like that of the Philippines or Singapore should arise,\r\nI cannot say how we should meet it. At the present moment, with a\r\npattern of Imperial virtue on the Throne, whose power and majesty have\r\npenetrated into the most distant regions, this foolish design of the\r\nbarbarians should on no account be tolerated. Wise men will do well to\r\nbe prepared against the day when it may be necessary for us to retire\r\nbefore them, clearing the country as we go.”\r\n\r\nThe following extract from a letter to a friend was written by Lan\r\nTing-yüan in 1724, and proves that if he objected to Christianity, he\r\nwas not one whit more inclined to tolerate Buddhism:--\r\n\r\n“Of all the eighteen provinces, Chehkiang is the one where Buddhist\r\npriests and nuns most abound. In the three prefectures of Hangchow,\r\nChia-hsing, and Huchow there cannot be fewer than several tens of\r\nthousands of them, of whom, by the way, not more than one-tenth have\r\nwillingly taken the vows. The others have been given to the priests\r\nwhen quite little, either because their parents were too poor to keep\r\nthem, or in return for some act of kindness; and when the children grow\r\nup, they are unable to get free. Buddhist nuns are also in most cases\r\nbought up when children as a means of making a more extensive show of\r\nreligion, and are carefully prevented from running away. They are not\r\ngiven in marriage--the desire for which is more or less implanted in\r\nevery human breast, and exists even amongst prophets and sages. And\r\nthus to condemn thousands and ten thousands of human beings to the\r\ndull monotony of the cloister, granting that they strictly keep their\r\nreligious vows, is more than sufficient to seriously interfere with\r\nthe equilibrium of the universe. Hence floods, famines, and the like\r\ncatastrophes; to say nothing of the misdeeds of the nuns in question.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“When I passed through Soochow and Hangchow I saw many disgraceful\r\nadvertisements that quite took my breath away with their barefaced\r\ndepravity; and the people there told me that these atrocities were much\r\npractised by the denizens of the cloister, which term is simply another\r\nname for houses of ill-fame. These cloister folk do a great deal of\r\nmischief amongst the populace, wasting the substance of some, and\r\nrobbing others of their good name.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Ming Chi Kang Mu_, or History of the Ming Dynasty, which had been\r\nbegun in 1689 by a commission of fifty-eight scholars, was laid before\r\nthe Emperor only in 1742 by CHANG T‘ING-YÜ (1670-1756), a Minister of\r\nState and a most learned writer, joint editor of the Book of Rites,\r\nRitual of the Chou Dynasty, the Thirteen Classics, the Twenty-four\r\nHistories, Thesaurus of Phraseology, Encyclopædia of Quotations, the\r\nConcordance to Literature, &c. This work, however, did not meet with\r\nthe Imperial approval, and for it was substituted the _T‘ung Chien Kang\r\nMu San Pien_, first published in 1775. Among the chief collaborators\r\nof Chang T‘ing-yü should be mentioned O-ÊRH-T‘AI, the Mongol (_d._\r\n1745), and CHU SHIH (1666-1736), both of whom were also voluminous\r\ncontributors to classical literature.\r\n\r\nThese were followed by CH’ÊN HUNG-MOU (1695-1771), who, besides\r\nbeing the author of brilliant State papers, was a commentator on\r\nthe Classics, dealing especially with the Four Books, a writer on\r\nmiscellaneous topics, and a most successful administrator. He rose to\r\nhigh office, and was noted for always having his room hung round with\r\nmaps of the province in which he was serving, so that he might become\r\nthoroughly familiar with its geography. He was dismissed, however, from\r\nthe important post of Viceroy of the Two Kuang for alleged incapacity\r\nin dealing with a plague of locusts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: YÜAN MEI]\r\n\r\nYÜAN MEI (1715-1797) is beyond all question the most popular\r\nwriter of modern times. At the early age of nine he was inspired with a\r\ndeep love for poetry, and soon became an adept at the art. Graduating\r\nin 1739, he was shortly afterwards sent to Kiangnan, and presently\r\nbecame magistrate at Nanking, where he greatly distinguished himself\r\nby the vigour and justice of his administration. A serious illness\r\nkept him for some time unemployed; and when on recovery he was sent\r\ninto Shansi, he managed to quarrel with the Viceroy. At the early age\r\nof forty he retired from the official arena and led a life of lettered\r\nease in his beautiful garden at Nanking. His letters, which have been\r\npublished under the title of _Hsiao Ts‘ang Shan Fang Ch‘ih Tu_, are\r\nextremely witty and amusing, and at the same time are models of style.\r\nMany of the best are a trifle coarse, sufficiently so to rank them with\r\nsome of the eighteenth-century literature on this side of the globe;\r\nthe salt of all loses its savour in translation. The following are\r\nspecimens:--\r\n\r\n“I have received your letter congratulating me on my present\r\nprosperity, and am very much obliged for the same.\r\n\r\n“At the end of the letter, however, you mention that you have a\r\ntobacco-pouch for me, which shall be sent on as soon as I forward you\r\na stanza. Surely this reminds one of the evil days of the Chous and\r\nthe Chêngs, when each State took pledges from the other. It certainly\r\nis not in keeping with the teaching of the sages, viz., that friends\r\nshould be the first to give. Why then do you neglect that teaching for\r\nthe custom of a degraded age?\r\n\r\n“If for a tobacco-pouch you insist upon having a stanza, for a hat or a\r\npair of boots you would want at least a poem; while your brother might\r\nsend me a cloak or a coat, and expect to get a whole epic in return! In\r\nthis way, the prosperity on which you congratulate me would not count\r\nfor much.\r\n\r\n“Shun Yü-t‘an of old sacrificed a bowl of rice and a perch to get a\r\nhundred waggons full of grain; he offered little and he wanted much.\r\nAnd have you not heard how a thousand pieces of silk were given for a\r\nsingle word? two beautiful girls for a stanza?--compared with which\r\nyour tobacco-pouch seems small indeed. It is probably because you are\r\na military man, accustomed to drill soldiers and to reward them with\r\na silver medal when they hit the mark, that you have at last come to\r\nregard this as the proper treatment of an old friend.\r\n\r\n“Did not Mencius forbid us to presume upon anything adventitious? And\r\nif friends may not presume upon their worth or position, how much less\r\nupon a tobacco-pouch? For a tobacco-pouch, pretty as it may be, is but\r\nthe handiwork of a waiting-maid; while my verses, poor as they may be,\r\nare the outcome of my intellectual powers. So that to exchange the\r\nwork of a waiting-maid’s fingers for the work of my brain, is a great\r\ncompliment to the waiting-maid, but a small one to me. Not so if you\r\nyourself had cast away spear and sword, and grasping the needle and\r\nsilk, had turned me out a tobacco-pouch of your own working. Then, had\r\nyou asked me even for ten stanzas, I would freely have given them. But\r\na great general knows his own strength as well as the enemy’s, and it\r\nwould hardly be proper for me to lure you from men’s to women’s work,\r\nand place on your head a ribboned cap. How then do you venture to\r\ntreat me as Ts‘ao Ts‘ao [on his death-bed treated his concubines], by\r\nbestowing on me an insignificant tobacco-pouch?\r\n\r\n“Having nothing better to do, I have amused myself with these few lines\r\nat your expense. If you take them ill, of course I shall never get\r\nthe pouch. But if you can mend your evil ways, then hurry up with the\r\ntobacco-pouch and trust to your luck for the verse.”\r\n\r\nA friend had sent Yüan Mei a letter with the very un-Chinese present\r\nof a crab and a duck. Two ducks and a crab would have been more\r\nconventional, or even two crabs and a duck. And by some mistake or\r\nother, the crab arrived by itself. Hence the following banter in\r\nreply:--\r\n\r\n“To convey a man to a crab is very pleasant for the man, but to convey\r\na crab to a man is pleasant for his whole family. And I know that this\r\nnight my two sons will often bend their arms like crabs’ claws [_i.e._\r\nin the form of the Chinese salute], wishing you an early success in\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n“In rhyme no duplicates [that is, don’t rhyme again the same sound],\r\nand don’t use two sentences where one will do [in composition]. Besides\r\nwhich, the fact that the duck has not yet turned up shows that you\r\nunderstand well how to ‘do one thing at a time.’ Not to mention\r\nthat you cause an old gobbler like myself to stretch out his neck in\r\nanticipation of something else to come.\r\n\r\n“You remember how the poet Shên beat his rival, all because of that one\r\nverse--\r\n\r\n  ‘_Sigh not for the sinking moon,\r\n  The jewel lamp will follow soon._’\r\n\r\nWell, your crab is like the sinking moon, while the duck reminds me of\r\nthe jewel lamp; from which we may infer that you will meet with the\r\nsame good luck as Shên.\r\n\r\n“Again, a crab, even in the presence of the King of the Ocean, has to\r\ntravel aslant; by which same token I trust that by and by your fame\r\nwill travel aslant the habitable globe.”\r\n\r\nYüan Mei’s poetry is much admired and widely read. He is one of the\r\nfew, very few, poets who have flourished under Manchu rule. Here are\r\nsome sarcastic lines by him:--\r\n\r\n  “_I’ve ever thought it passing odd\r\n  How all men reverence some God,\r\n  And wear their lives out for his sake\r\n  And bow their heads until they ache.\r\n  ’Tis clear to me the Gods are made\r\n  Of the same stuff as wind or shade....\r\n  Ah! if they came to every caller,\r\n  I’d be the very loudest bawler!_”\r\n\r\nHe could be pathetic enough at times, as he showed in his elegy on a\r\nlittle five-year-old daughter, recalling her baby efforts with the\r\npaint-brush, and telling how she cut out clothes from paper, or sat\r\nand watched her father engaged in composition. He was also, like all\r\nChinese poets, an ardent lover of nature, and a winter plum-tree in\r\nflower, or a gust of wind scattering dead leaves, would set all his\r\npoetic fibres thrilling again. It sounds like an anti-climax to add\r\nthat this brilliant essayist, letter-writer, and composer of finished\r\nverse owes perhaps the chief part of his fame to a cookery-book. Yet\r\nsuch is actually the case. Yüan Mei was the Brillat-Savarin of China,\r\nand in the art of cooking China stands next to France. His cookery-book\r\nis a gossipy little work, written, as only such a scholar could write\r\nit, in a style which at once invests the subject with dignity and\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n“Everything,” says Yüan Mei, in his opening chapter, “has its\r\nown original constitution, just as each man has certain natural\r\ncharacteristics. If a man’s natural abilities are of a low order,\r\nConfucius and Mencius themselves would teach him to no purpose. And if\r\nan article of food is in itself bad, not even I-ya [the Soyer of China]\r\ncould cook a flavour into it.\r\n\r\n“A ham is a ham; but in point of goodness two hams will be as widely\r\nseparated as sky and sea. A mackerel is a mackerel; but in point of\r\nexcellence two mackerel will differ as much as ice and live coals.\r\nAnd other things in the same way. So that the credit of a good dinner\r\nshould be divided between the cook and the steward forty per cent. to\r\nthe steward, and sixty per cent. to the cook.\r\n\r\n“Cookery is like matrimony. Two things served together should match.\r\nClear should go with clear, thick with thick, hard with hard, and soft\r\nwith soft. I have known people mix grated lobster with birds’-nests,\r\nand mint with chicken or pork!\r\n\r\n“The cooks of to-day think nothing of mixing in one soup the meat of\r\nchicken, duck, pig, and goose. But these chickens, ducks, pigs, and\r\ngeese have doubtless souls. And these souls will most certainly file\r\nplaints in the next world on the way they have been treated in this.\r\nA good cook will use plenty of different dishes. Each article of food\r\nwill be made to exhibit its own characteristics, while each made dish\r\nwill be characterised by one dominant flavour. Then the palate of the\r\ngourmand will respond without fail, and the flowers of the soul blossom\r\nforth.\r\n\r\n“Let salt fish come first, and afterwards food of more negative\r\nflavour. Let the heavy precede the light. Let dry dishes precede those\r\nwith gravy. No flavour must dominate. If a guest eats his fill of\r\nsavouries, his stomach will be fatigued. Salt flavours must be relieved\r\nby bitter or hot tasting foods, in order to restore the palate. Too\r\nmuch wine will make the stomach dull. Sour or sweet food will be\r\nrequired to rouse it again into vigour.\r\n\r\n“In winter we should eat beef and mutton. In summer, dried and\r\npreserved meats. As for condiments, mustard belongs specially to\r\nsummer, pepper to winter.\r\n\r\n“Don’t cut bamboo-shoots [the Chinese equivalent of asparagus] with an\r\noniony knife.... A good cook frequently wipes his knife, frequently\r\nchanges his cloth, frequently scrapes his board, and frequently washes\r\nhis hands. If smoke or ashes from his pipe, perspiration-drops from his\r\nhead, insects from the wall, or smuts from the saucepan get mixed up\r\nwith the food, though he were a very _chef_ among _chefs_, yet would\r\nmen hold their noses and decline.\r\n\r\n“Don’t make your thick sauces greasy nor your clear ones tasteless.\r\nThose who want grease can eat fat pork, while a drink of water is\r\nbetter than something which tastes of nothing at all.... Don’t\r\nover-salt your soups; for salt can be added to taste, but can never be\r\ntaken away.\r\n\r\n“_Don’t eat with your ears_; by which I mean do not aim at having\r\nextraordinary out-of-the-way foods, just to astonish your guests; for\r\nthat is to eat with your ears, not with the mouth. Bean-curd, if good,\r\nis actually nicer than birds’-nest; and better than sea-slugs, which\r\nare not first-rate, is a dish of bamboo shoots....\r\n\r\n“The chicken, the pig, the fish, and the duck, these are the four\r\nheroes of the table. Sea-slugs and birds’-nests have no characteristic\r\nflavours of their own. They are but usurpers in the house. I once dined\r\nwith a friend who gave us birds’-nest in bowls more like vats, holding\r\neach about four ounces of the plain-boiled article. The other guests\r\napplauded vigorously; but I smiled and said, ‘_I came here to eat\r\nbirds’-nest, not to take delivery of it wholesale._’\r\n\r\n“_Don’t eat with your eyes_; by which I mean do not cover the table\r\nwith innumerable dishes and multiply courses indefinitely. For this is\r\nto eat with the eyes, and not with the mouth.\r\n\r\n“Just as a calligraphist should not overtire his hand nor a poet his\r\nbrain, so a good cook cannot possibly turn out in one day more than\r\nfour or five distinct _plats_. I used to dine with a merchant friend\r\nwho would put on no less than three removes [sets of eight dishes\r\nserved separately], and sixteen kinds of sweets, so that by the time\r\nwe had finished we had got through a total of some forty courses. My\r\nhost gloried in all this, but when I got home I used to have a bowl of\r\nrice-gruel. I felt so hungry.\r\n\r\n“To know right from wrong, a man must be sober. And only a sober man\r\ncan distinguish good flavours from bad. It has been well said that\r\nwords are inadequate to describe the _nuances_ of taste. How much less\r\nthen must a stuttering sot be able to appreciate them!\r\n\r\n“I have often seen votaries of guess-fingers swallow choice food as\r\nthough so much sawdust, their minds being preoccupied with their game.\r\nNow I say eat first and drink afterwards. By these means the result\r\nwill be successful in each direction.”\r\n\r\nYüan Mei also protests against the troublesome custom of pressing\r\nguests to eat, and against the more foolish one of piling up choice\r\npieces on the little saucers used as plates, and even putting them into\r\nthe guests’ mouths, as if they were children or brides, too shy to help\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThere was a man in Ch‘ang-an, he tells us, who was very fond of giving\r\ndinners; but the food was atrocious. One day a guest threw himself on\r\nhis knees in front of this gentleman and said, “Am I not a friend of\r\nyours?”\r\n\r\n“You are indeed,” replied his host.\r\n\r\n“Then I must ask of you a favour,” said the guest, “and you must grant\r\nit before I rise from my knees.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what is it?” inquired his host in astonishment.\r\n\r\n“Never to invite me to dinner any more!” cried the guest; at which the\r\nwhole party burst into a loud roar of laughter.\r\n\r\n“Into no department of life,” says Yüan Mei, “should indifference be\r\nallowed to creep; into none less than into the domain of cookery.\r\nCooks are but mean fellows; and if a day is passed without either\r\nrewarding or punishing them, that day is surely marked by negligence\r\nor carelessness on their part. If badly cooked food is swallowed in\r\nsilence, such neglect will speedily become a habit. Still, mere rewards\r\nand punishments are of no use. If a dish is good, attention should be\r\ncalled to the why and the wherefore. If bad, an effort should be made\r\nto discover the cause of the failure.\r\n\r\n“I am not much of a wine-drinker, but this makes me all the more\r\nparticular. Wine is like scholarship: it ripens with age; and it is\r\nbest from a fresh-opened jar. The top of the wine-jar, the bottom of\r\nthe teapot, as the saying has it.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CH’ÊN HAO-TZŬ]\r\n\r\nIn 1783 CH’ÊN HAO-TZŬ, who lived beside the Western Lake at\r\nHangchow, and called himself the Flower Hermit, published a gossipy\r\nlittle work on gardening and country pursuits, under the title of “The\r\nMirror of Flowers.” It is the type of a class often to be seen in the\r\nhands of Chinese readers. The preface was written by himself:--\r\n\r\n“From my youth upwards I have cared for nothing save books and flowers.\r\nTwenty-eight thousand days have passed over my head, the greater part\r\nof which has been spent in poring over old records, and the remainder\r\nin enjoying myself in my garden among plants and birds.”\r\n\r\nThe Chinese excel in horticulture, and the passionate love of flowers\r\nwhich prevails among all classes is quite a national characteristic.\r\nA Chinaman, however, has his own particular standpoint. The vulgar\r\nnosegay or the plutocratic bouquet would have no charms for him. He\r\ncan see, with satisfaction, only one flower at a time. His best vases\r\nare made to hold a single spray, and large vases usually have covers\r\nperforated so as to isolate each specimen. A primrose by the river’s\r\nbrim would be to him a complete poem. If condemned to a sedentary\r\nlife, he likes to have a flower by his side on the table. He draws\r\nenjoyment, even inspiration, from its petals. He will take a flower out\r\nfor a walk, and stop every now and again to consider the loveliness of\r\nits growth. So with birds. It is a common thing on a pleasant evening\r\nto meet a Chinaman carrying his bird-cage suspended from the end of a\r\nshort stick. He will stop at some pleasant corner outside the town, and\r\nlisten with rapture to the bird’s song. But to the preface. Our author\r\ngoes on to say that in his hollow bamboo pillow he always keeps some\r\nwork on his favourite subject.\r\n\r\n“People laugh at me, and say that I am cracked on flowers and a\r\nbibliomaniac; but surely study is the proper occupation of a literary\r\nman, and as for gardening, that is simply a rest for my brain and a\r\nrelaxation in my declining years. What does T‘ao Ch‘ien say?--\r\n\r\n  ‘_Riches and rank I do not love,\r\n  I have no hopes of heaven above._’ ...\r\n\r\nBesides, it is only in hours of leisure that I devote myself to the\r\ncultivation of flowers.”\r\n\r\nCh‘ên Hao-tzŭ then runs through the four seasons, showing how each has\r\nits especial charm, contributing to the sum of those pure pleasures\r\nwhich are the best antidote against the ills of old age. He then\r\nproceeds to deal with times and seasons, showing what to do under\r\neach month, precisely as our own garden-books do. After that come\r\nshort chapters on all the chief trees, shrubs, and plants of China,\r\nwith hints how to treat them under diverse circumstances, the whole\r\nconcluding with a separate section devoted to birds, animals, fishes,\r\nand insects. Among these are to be found the crane, peacock, parrot,\r\nthrush, kite, quail, mainah, swallow, deer, hare, monkey, dog, cat,\r\nsquirrel, goldfish--first mentioned by Su Shih,\r\n\r\n  “_Upon the bridge the livelong day\r\n  I stand and watch the goldfish play_”--\r\n\r\nbee, butterfly, glowworm, &c. Altogether there is much to be learnt\r\nfrom this Chinese White of Selborne, and the reader lays down the book\r\nfeeling that the writer is not far astray when he says, “If a home has\r\nnot a garden and an old tree, I see not whence the everyday joys of\r\nlife are to come.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHAO I]\r\n\r\nCHAO I (1727-1814) is said to have known several tens of\r\ncharacters when only three years old,--the age at which John Stuart\r\nMill believed that he began Greek. It was not, however, until 1761\r\nthat he took his final degree, appearing second on the list. He was\r\nreally first, but the Emperor put Wang Chieh over his head, in order to\r\nencourage men from Shensi, to which province the latter belonged. That\r\nWang Chieh is remembered at all must be set down to the above episode,\r\nand not to the two volumes of essays which he left behind him. Chao I\r\nwrote a history of the wars of the present dynasty, a collection of\r\nnotes on the current topics of his day, historical critiques, and other\r\nworks. He was also a poet, contributing a large volume of verse, from\r\nwhich the following sample of his art is taken:--\r\n\r\n  “_Man is indeed of heavenly birth,\r\n  Though seeming earthy of the earth;\r\n  The sky is but a denser pall\r\n  Of the thin air that covers all.\r\n  Just as this air, so is that sky;\r\n  Why call this low, and call that high?_\r\n\r\n  “_The dewdrop sparkles in the cup--\r\n  Note how the eager flowers spring up;\r\n  Confine and crib them in a room,\r\n  They fade and find an early doom.\r\n  So ’tis that at our very feet\r\n  The earth and the empyrean meet._\r\n\r\n  “_The babe at birth points heavenward too,\r\n  Enveloped by the eternal blue;\r\n  As fishes in the water bide,\r\n  So heaven surrounds on every side;\r\n  Yet men sin on, because they say\r\n  Great God in heaven is far away._”\r\n\r\nThe “stop short” was a great favourite with him. His level may be\r\ngauged by the following specimen, written as he was setting out to a\r\ndistant post in the north:--\r\n\r\n  “_See where, like specks of spring-cloud in the sky,\r\n  On their long northern route the wild geese fly;\r\n  Together o’er the River we will roam....\r\n  Ah! they go towards, and I away from home!_”\r\n\r\nHere is another in a more humorous vein:--\r\n\r\n  “_The rain had been raining the whole of the day,\r\n  And I had been straining and working away....\r\n  What’s the trouble, O cook? You’ve no millet in store?\r\n  Well, I’ve written a book which will buy us some more._”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FANG WEI-I]\r\n\r\nTaken altogether, the poetry of the present dynasty, especially that\r\nof the nineteenth century, must be written down as nothing more\r\nthan artificial verse, with the art not even concealed, but grossly\r\npatent to the dullest observer. A collection of extracts from about\r\n2000 representative poets was published in 1857, but it is very dull\r\nreading, any thoughts, save the most commonplace, being few and far\r\nbetween. As in every similar collection, a place is assigned to\r\npoetesses, of whom FANG WEI-I would perhaps be a favourable\r\nexample. She came from a good family, and was but newly married to\r\na promising young official when the latter died, and left her a\r\nsorrowing and childless widow. Light came to her in the darkness, and\r\ndisregarding the entreaties of her father and mother, she decided to\r\nbecome a nun, and devote the remainder of her life to the service of\r\nBuddha. These are her farewell lines:--\r\n\r\n  “_’Tis common talk how partings sadden life:\r\n    There are no partings for us after death.\r\n  But let that pass; now no more a wife,\r\n    Will face fate’s issues to my latest breath._\r\n\r\n  “_The north wind whistles thro’ the mulberry grove,\r\n    Daily and nightly making moan for me;\r\n  I look up to the shifting sky above,\r\n    No little prattler smiling on my knee._\r\n\r\n  “_Life’s sweetest boon is after all to die....\r\n    My weeping parents still are loth to yield;\r\n  Yet east and west the callow fledglings fly,\r\n    And autumn’s herbage wanders far afield._\r\n\r\n  “_What will life bring to me an I should stay?\r\n    What will death bring to me an I should go?\r\n  These thoughts surge through me in the light of day,\r\n    And make me conscious that at last I know._”\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest of the scholars of the present dynasty was YÜAN\r\nYÜAN (1764-1849). He took his third degree in 1789, and at the\r\nfinal examination the aged Emperor Ch‘ien Lung was so struck with\r\nhis talents that he exclaimed, “Who would have thought that, after\r\npassing my eightieth year, I should find another such man as this one?”\r\nHe then held many high offices in succession, including the post of\r\nGovernor of Chehkiang, in which he operated vigorously against the\r\nAnnamese pirates and Ts‘ai Ch‘ien, established the tithing system,\r\ncolleges, schools, and soup-kitchens, besides devoting himself to the\r\npreservation of ancient monuments. As Viceroy of the Two Kuang, he\r\nfrequently came into collision with British interests, and did his best\r\nto keep a tight hand over the barbarian merchants. He was a voluminous\r\nwriter on the Classics, astronomy, archæology, &c., and various\r\nimportant collections were produced under his patronage. Among these\r\nmay be mentioned the _Huang Ch‘ing Ching Chieh_, containing upwards\r\nof 180 separate works, and the _Ch‘ou Jen Chuan_, a biographical\r\ndictionary of famous mathematicians of all ages, including Euclid,\r\nNewton, and Ricci, the Jesuit Father. He also published a Topography\r\nof Kuangtung, specimens of the compositions of more than 5000 poets of\r\nKiangsi, and a large collection of inscriptions on bells and vases.\r\nHe also edited the Catalogue of the Imperial Library, the large\r\nencyclopædia known as the _T‘ai P‘ing Yü Lan_, and other important\r\nworks.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE KAN YING P‘IEN]\r\n\r\nTwo religious works, associated with the Taoism of modern days, which\r\nhave long been popular throughout China, may fitly be mentioned\r\nhere. They are not to be bought in shops, but can always be obtained\r\nat temples, where large numbers are placed by philanthropists for\r\ndistribution gratis. The first is the _Kan Ying P‘ien_, or Book of\r\nRewards and Punishments, attributed by the foolish to Lao Tzŭ himself.\r\nIts real date is quite unknown; moderate writers place it in the\r\nSung dynasty, but even that seems far too early. Although nominally\r\nof Taoist origin, this work is usually edited in a very pronounced\r\nBuddhist setting, the fact being that Taoism and Buddhism are now so\r\nmixed up that it is impossible to draw any sharp line of demarcation\r\nbetween the two. As Chu Hsi says, “Buddhism stole the best features\r\nof Taoism, and Taoism stole the worst features of Buddhism; it is as\r\nthough the one stole a jewel from the other, and the loser recouped\r\nthe loss with a stone.” Prefixed to the _Kan Ying P‘ien_ will be found\r\nBuddhist formulæ for cleansing the mouth and body before beginning\r\nto read the text, and appeals to Maitrêya Buddha and Avalôkitêsvara.\r\nMarried women and girls are advised not to frequent temples to be a\r\nspectacle for men. “If you must worship Buddha, worship the two living\r\nBuddhas (parents) you have at home; and if you must burn incense, burn\r\nit at the family altar.” We are further told that there is no time\r\nat which this book may not be read; no place in which it may not be\r\nread; and no person by whom it may not be read with profit. We are\r\nadvised to study it when fasting, and not necessarily to shout it\r\naloud, so as to be heard of men, but rather to ponder over it in the\r\nheart. The text consists of a commination said to have been uttered by\r\nLao Tzŭ, and directed against evil-doers of all kinds. In the opening\r\nparagraphs attention is drawn to various spiritual beings who note\r\ndown the good deeds and crimes of men, and lengthen or shorten their\r\nlives accordingly. Then follows a long list of wicked acts which will\r\ninevitably bring retribution in their train. These include the ordinary\r\noffences recognised by moral codes all over the world, every form of\r\ninjustice and oppression, falsehood, and theft, together with not a few\r\nothers of a more venial character to Western minds. Among the latter\r\nare birds’-nesting, stepping across food or human beings, cooking\r\nwith dirty firewood, spitting at shooting stars and pointing at the\r\nrainbow, or even at the sun, moon, and stars. In all these cases,\r\nperiods will be cut off from the life of the offender, and if his life\r\nis exhausted while any guilt still remains unexpiated, the punishment\r\ndue will be carried on to the account of his descendants.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE YÜ LI CH’AO CHUAN]\r\n\r\nThe second of the two works under consideration is the _Yü Li Ch‘ao\r\nChuan_, a description of the Ten Courts of Purgatory in the nether\r\nworld, through some or all of which every erring soul must pass before\r\nbeing allowed to be born again into this world under another form, or\r\nto be permanently transferred to the eternal bliss reserved for the\r\nrighteous alone.\r\n\r\nIn the Fifth Court, for instance, the sinners are hurried away by\r\nbull-headed, horse-faced demons to a famous terrace, where their\r\nphysical punishments are aggravated by a view of their old homes:--\r\n\r\n“This terrace is curved in front like a bow; it looks east, west, and\r\nsouth. It is eighty-one _li_ from one extreme to the other. The back\r\npart is like the string of a bow; it is enclosed by a wall of sharp\r\nswords. It is 490 feet high; its sides are knife-blades; and the whole\r\nis in sixty-three storeys. No good shade comes to this terrace; neither\r\ndo those whose balance of good and evil is exact. Wicked souls alone\r\nbehold their homes close by, and can see and hear what is going on.\r\nThey hear old and young talking together; they see their last wishes\r\ndisregarded and their instructions disobeyed. Everything seems to\r\nhave undergone a change. The property they scraped together with so\r\nmuch trouble is dissipated and gone. The husband thinks of taking\r\nanother wife; the widow meditates second nuptials. Strangers are in\r\npossession of the old estate; there is nothing to divide amongst the\r\nchildren. Debts long since paid are brought again for settlement, and\r\nthe survivors are called upon to acknowledge claims upon the departed.\r\nDebts owed are lost for want of evidence, with endless recriminations,\r\nabuse, and general confusion, all of which falls upon the three\r\nfamilies of the deceased. They in their anger speak ill of him that is\r\ngone. He sees his children become corrupt and his friends fall away.\r\nSome, perhaps, for the sake of bygone times, may stroke the coffin and\r\nlet fall a tear, departing quickly with a cold smile. Worse than that,\r\nthe wife sees her husband tortured in the yamên; the husband sees his\r\nwife victim to some horrible disease, lands gone, houses destroyed by\r\nflood or fire, and everything in unutterable confusion--the reward of\r\nformer sins.”\r\n\r\nThe Sixth Court “is a vast, noisy Gehenna, many leagues in extent, and\r\naround it are sixteen wards.\r\n\r\n“In the first, the souls are made to kneel for long periods on iron\r\nshot. In the second, they are placed up to their necks in filth. In the\r\nthird, they are pounded till the blood runs out. In the fourth, their\r\nmouths are opened with iron pincers and filled full of needles. In the\r\nfifth, they are bitten by rats. In the sixth, they are enclosed in a\r\nnet of thorns and nipped by locusts. In the seventh, they are crushed\r\nto a jelly. In the eighth, their skin is lacerated and they are beaten\r\non the raw. In the ninth, their mouths are filled with fire. In the\r\ntenth, they are licked by flames. In the eleventh, they are subjected\r\nto noisome smells. In the twelfth, they are butted by oxen and trampled\r\non by horses. In the thirteenth, their hearts are scratched. In the\r\nfourteenth, their heads are rubbed till their skulls come off. In the\r\nfifteenth, they are chopped in two at the waist. In the sixteenth,\r\ntheir skin is taken off and rolled up into spills.\r\n\r\n“Those discontented ones who rail against heaven and revile earth, who\r\nare always finding fault either with the wind, thunder, heat, cold,\r\nfine weather, or rain; those who let their tears fall towards the\r\nnorth; who steal the gold from the inside or scrape the gilding from\r\nthe outside of images; those who take holy names in vain, who show no\r\nrespect for written paper, who throw down dirt and rubbish near pagodas\r\nor temples, who use dirty cook-houses and stoves for preparing the\r\nsacrificial meats, who do not abstain from eating beef and dog-flesh;\r\nthose who have in their possession blasphemous or obscene books and\r\ndo not destroy them, who obliterate or tear books which teach man to\r\nbe good, who carve on common articles of household use the symbol of\r\nthe origin of all things, the Sun and Moon and Seven Stars, the Royal\r\nMother and the God of Longevity on the same article, or representations\r\nof any of the Immortals; those who embroider the Svastika on\r\nfancy-work, or mark characters on silk, satin, or cloth, on banners,\r\nbeds, chairs, tables, or any kind of utensil; those who secretly wear\r\nclothes adorned with the dragon and the phœnix only to be trampled\r\nunder foot, who buy up grain and hold until the price is exorbitantly\r\nhigh--all these shall be thrust into the great and noisy Gehenna, there\r\nto be examined as to their misdeeds and passed accordingly into one of\r\nthe sixteen wards, whence, at the expiration of their time, they will\r\nbe sent for further questioning on to the Seventh Court.”\r\n\r\nThe Tenth Court deals with the final stage of transmigration previous\r\nto rebirth in the world. It appears that in primeval ages men could\r\nremember their former lives on earth even after having passed through\r\nPurgatory, and that wicked persons often took advantage of such\r\nknowledge. To remedy this, a Terrace of Oblivion was built, and all\r\nshades are now sent thither, and are forced to drink the cup of\r\nforgetfulness before they can be born again.\r\n\r\n“Whether they swallow much or little it matters not; but sometimes\r\nthere are perverse devils who altogether refuse to drink. Then beneath\r\ntheir feet sharp blades start up, and a copper tube is forced down\r\ntheir throats, by which means they are compelled to swallow some. When\r\nthey have drunk, they are raised by the attendants and escorted back by\r\nthe same path. They are next pushed on to the Bitter Bamboo floating\r\nbridge, with torrents of rushing red water on either side. Half-way\r\nacross they perceive written in large characters on a red cliff on the\r\nopposite side the following lines:--\r\n\r\n  “_To be a man is easy, but to act up to one’s responsibilities as such\r\n      is hard;\r\n  Yet to be a man once again is perhaps harder still._\r\n\r\n  “_For those who would be born again in some happy state there is no\r\n      great difficulty;\r\n  It is only necessary to keep mouth and heart in harmony._”\r\n\r\n“When the shades have read these words, they try to jump on shore, but\r\nare beaten back into the water by two huge devils. One has on a black\r\nofficial hat and embroidered clothes; in his hand he holds a paper\r\npencil, and over his shoulder he carries a sharp sword. Instruments of\r\ntorture hang at his waist; fiercely he glares out of his large round\r\neyes and laughs a horrid laugh. His name is Short-Life. The other has a\r\ndirty face smeared with blood; he has on a white coat, an abacus in his\r\nhand, and a rice-sack over his shoulder. Around his neck hangs a string\r\nof paper money; his brow contracts hideously and he utters long sighs.\r\nHis name is They-have-their-Reward, and his duty is to push the shades\r\ninto the red water. The wicked and foolish rejoice at the prospect of\r\nbeing born once more as human beings, but the better shades weep and\r\nmourn that in life they did not lay up a store of virtuous acts, and\r\nthus pass away from the state of mortals for ever. Yet they all rush\r\non to birth like an infatuated or drunken crowd, and again, in their\r\nnew childhood, hanker after forbidden flavours. Then, regardless of\r\nconsequences, they begin to destroy life, and thus forfeit all claims\r\nto the mercy and compassion of God. They take no thought as to the end\r\nthat must overtake them; and, finally, they bring themselves once more\r\nto the same horrid plight.”\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[46] A Solomonic judge under the Sung dynasty.\r\n\r\n[47] “In hearing litigations, I am like any other body. What is\r\nnecessary is to cause the people to have no litigations” (Legge).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nWALL LITERATURE--JOURNALISM--WIT AND HUMOUR--PROVERBS AND MAXIMS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe death of Yüan Yüan in 1849 brings us down to the period when\r\nChina began to find herself for the first time face to face with\r\nthe foreigner. The opening of five ports in 1842 to comparatively\r\nunrestricted trade, followed by more ports and right of residence in\r\nPeking from 1860, created points of contact and brought about foreign\r\ncomplications to which the governors of China had hitherto been unused.\r\nA Chinese Horace might well complain that the audacious brood of\r\nEngland have by wicked fraud introduced journalism into the Empire, and\r\nthat evils worse than consumption and fevers have followed in its train.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PROCLAMATIONS]\r\n\r\nFrom time immemorial wall-literature has been a feature in the life\r\nof a Chinese city surpassing in extent and variety that of any other\r\nnation, and often playing a part fraught with much danger to the\r\ncommunity at large. Generally speaking, the literature of the walls\r\ncovers pretty much the same ground as an ordinary English newspaper,\r\nfrom the “agony” column downwards. For, mixed up with notices of lost\r\nproperty, consisting sometimes of human beings, and advertisements\r\nof all kinds of articles of trade, such as one would naturally look\r\nfor in the handbill literature of any city, there are to be found\r\nannouncements of new and startling remedies for various diseases or of\r\ninfallible pills for the cure of depraved opium-smokers, long lists\r\nof the names of subscribers to some coming festival or to the pious\r\nrestoration of a local temple, sermons without end directed against the\r\nabuse of written paper, and now and then against female infanticide,\r\nor Cumming-like warnings of an approaching millennium, at which the\r\nwicked will receive the reward of their crimes according to the\r\nhorrible arrangements of the Buddhist-Taoist purgatory. Occasionally an\r\nobjectionable person will be advised through an anonymous placard to\r\ndesist from a course which is pointed out as offensive, and similarly,\r\nbut more rarely, the action of an official will be sometimes severely\r\ncriticised or condemned. Official proclamations on public business can\r\nhardly be classed as wall literature, except perhaps when, as is not\r\nuncommon, they are written in doggerel verse, with a view to appealing\r\nmore directly to the illiterate reader. The following proclamation\r\nestablishing a registry office for boats at Tientsin will give an idea\r\nof these queer documents, the only parallel to which in the West might\r\nbe found in the famous lines issued by the Board of Trade for the use\r\nof sea-captains:--\r\n\r\n  “_Green to green, and red to red,\r\n  Perfect safety, go ahead_,” _&c._\r\n\r\nThe object of this registry office was ostensibly to save the poor\r\nboatman from being unfairly dealt with when impressed at nominal wages\r\nfor Government service, but really to enable the officials to know\r\nexactly where to lay their hands on boats when required:--\r\n\r\n  “_A busy town is Tientsin,\r\n  A land and water thoroughfare;\r\n  Traders, as thick as clouds, flock in;\r\n  Masts rise in forests everywhere._\r\n\r\n  “_The official’s chair, the runner’s cap,\r\n  Flit past like falling rain or snow.\r\n  And, musing on the boatman’s hap,\r\n  His doubtful shares of weal and woe,_\r\n\r\n  “_I note the vagabonds who live\r\n  On squeezes from his hard-earned due;\r\n  And, boatmen, for your sakes I give\r\n  A public register to you._\r\n\r\n  “_Go straightway there, your names inscribe\r\n  And on the books a record raise;\r\n  None then dare claim the wicked bribe,\r\n  Or waste your time in long delays._\r\n\r\n  “_The services your country claims\r\n  Shall be performed in turn by all\r\n  The muster of the boatmen’s names\r\n  Be published on the Yamên wall._\r\n\r\n  “_Once your official business done,\r\n  Work for yourselves as best you can;\r\n  Let out your boats to any one;\r\n  I’ll give a pass to every man._\r\n\r\n  “_And lest your lot be hard to bear\r\n  Official pay shall ample be;\r\n  Let all who notice aught unfair\r\n  Report the case at once to me._\r\n\r\n  “_The culprit shall be well deterred\r\n  In future, if his guilt is clear;\r\n  For times are hard, as I have heard,\r\n  And food and clothing getting dear._\r\n\r\n  “_Thus, in compassion for your woe,\r\n  The scales of Justice in my hand,\r\n  I save you from the Yamên foe,\r\n  The barrack-soldiers’ threat’ning band._\r\n\r\n  “_No longer will they dare to play\r\n  Their shameful tricks, of late revealed;\r\n  The office only sends away\r\n  Boats--and on orders duly sealed._\r\n\r\n  “_One rule will thus be made for all,\r\n  And things may not go much amiss;\r\n  Ye boatmen, ’tis on you I call\r\n  To show your gratitude for this._\r\n\r\n  “_But lest there be who ignorance plead,\r\n  I issue this in hope to awe\r\n  Such fools as think they will succeed\r\n  By trying to evade the law._\r\n\r\n  “_For if I catch them, no light fate\r\n  Awaits them that unlucky day;\r\n  So from this proclamation’s date\r\n  Let all in fear and dread obey._”\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to add that wall literature has often been\r\ndirected against foreigners, and especially against missionaries. The\r\npenalties, however, for posting anonymous placards are very severe,\r\nand of late years the same end has been more effectually attained by\r\nthe circulation of abusive fly-sheets, often pictorial and always\r\ndisgusting.\r\n\r\nJournalism has proved to be a terrible thorn in the official side. It\r\nwas first introduced into China under the ægis of an Englishman who was\r\nthe nominal editor of the _Shên Pao_ or _Shanghai News_, still a very\r\ninfluential newspaper. For a long time the authorities fought to get\r\nrid of this objectionable daily, which now and again told some awkward\r\ntruths, and contained many ably written articles by first-class native\r\nscholars. Eventually an official organ was started in opposition, and\r\nother papers have since appeared. An illustrated Chinese weekly made\r\na good beginning in Shanghai, but unfortunately it soon drifted into\r\nsuperstition, intolerance, and vulgarity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TRANSLATIONS]\r\n\r\nAttempts have been made to provide the Chinese with translations\r\nof noted European works, and among those which have been produced\r\nmay be mentioned “The Pilgrim’s Progress,” with illustrations, the\r\nvarious characters being in Chinese dress; Mr. Herbert Spencer’s\r\n“Education,” the very first sentence in which is painfully misrendered;\r\nthe “Adventures of Baron Munchausen,” and others. In every case save\r\none these efforts have been rejected by the Chinese on the ground of\r\ninferior style. The exception was a translation of Æsop’s Fables,\r\npublished in 1840 by Robert Thom as rendered into Chinese by an eminent\r\nnative scholar. This work attracted much attention among the people\r\ngenerally; so much so, that the officials took alarm and made strenuous\r\nefforts to suppress it. Recent years have witnessed the publication\r\nin Chinese of “Vathek,” in reference to which a literate of standing\r\noffered the following criticism:--“The style in which this work is\r\nwritten is not so bad, but the subject-matter is of no account.” The\r\nfact is, that to satisfy the taste of the educated Chinese reader the\r\nvery first requisite is style. As has been seen in the case of the\r\n_Liao Chai_, the Chinese will read almost anything, provided it is set\r\nin a faultless frame. They will not look at anything emanating from\r\nforeign sources in which this greatest desideratum has been neglected.\r\n\r\nThe present age has seen the birth of no great original writer in any\r\ndepartment of literature, nor the production of any great original work\r\nworthy to be smeared with cedar-oil for the delectation of posterity.\r\nIt is customary after the death, sometimes during the life, of any\r\nleading statesman to publish a collection of his memorials to the\r\nthrone, with possibly a few essays and some poems. Such have a brief\r\n_succès d’estime_, and are then used by binders for thickening the\r\nfolded leaves of some masterpiece of antiquity. Successful candidates\r\nfor the final degree usually print their winning essays, and sometimes\r\ntheir poems, chiefly for distribution among friends. Several diaries\r\nof Ministers to foreign countries and similar books have appeared\r\nin recent years, recording the astonishment of the writers at the\r\nextraordinary social customs which prevail among the barbarians. But\r\nnowadays a Chinaman who wishes to read a book does not sit down and\r\nwrite one. He is too much oppressed by the vast dimensions of his\r\nexisting literature, and by the hopelessness of rivalling, and still\r\nmore by the hopelessness of surpassing, those immortals who have gone\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WIT AND HUMOUR]\r\n\r\nIt would be obviously unfair to describe the Chinese people as wanting\r\nin humour simply because they are tickled by jests which leave us\r\ncomparatively unmoved. Few of our own most amusing stories will stand\r\nconversion into Chinese terms. The following are specimens of classical\r\nhumour, being such as might be introduced into any serious biographical\r\nnotice of the individuals concerned.\r\n\r\nCh‘un-yü K‘un (4th cent. B.C.) was the wit already mentioned,\r\nwho tried to entangle Mencius in his talk. On one occasion, when\r\nthe Ch‘u State was about to attack the Ch‘i State, he was ordered\r\nby the Prince of Ch‘i, who was his father-in-law, to proceed to the\r\nChao State and ask that an army might be sent to their assistance;\r\nto which end the Prince supplied him with 100 lbs. of silver and ten\r\nchariots as offerings to the ruler of Chao. At this Ch‘un-yü laughed\r\nso immoderately that he snapped the lash of his cap; and when the\r\nPrince asked him what was the joke, he said, “As I was coming along\r\nthis morning, I saw a husbandman sacrificing a pig’s foot and a single\r\ncup of wine; after which he prayed, saying, ‘O God, make my upper\r\nterraces fill baskets and my lower terraces fill carts; make my fields\r\nbloom with crops and my barns burst with grain!’ And I could not help\r\nlaughing at a man who offered so little and wanted so much.” The Prince\r\ntook the hint, and obtained the assistance he required.\r\n\r\nT‘ao Ku (A.D. 902-970) was an eminent official whose name\r\nis popularly known in connection with the following repartee. Having\r\nordered a newly-purchased waiting-maid to get some snow and make tea in\r\nhonour of the Feast of Lanterns, he asked her, somewhat pompously, “Was\r\nthat the custom in your former home?” “Oh, no,” the girl replied; “they\r\nwere a rough lot. They just put up a gold-splashed awning, and had a\r\nlittle music and some old wine.”\r\n\r\nLi Chia-ming (10th cent. A.D.) was a wit at the Court of\r\nthe last ruler of the T‘ang dynasty. On one occasion the latter drew\r\nattention to some gathering clouds which appeared about to bring\r\nrain. “They may come,” said Li Chia-ming, “but they will not venture\r\nto enter the city.” “Why not?” asked the Prince. “Because,” replied\r\nthe wit, “the octroi is so high.” Orders were thereupon issued that\r\nthe duties should be reduced by one-half. On another occasion the\r\nPrince was fishing with some of his courtiers, all of whom managed to\r\ncatch something, whereas he himself, to his great chagrin, had not a\r\nsingle bite. Thereupon Li Chia-ming took a pen and wrote the following\r\nlines:--\r\n\r\n  “_’Tis rapture in the warm spring days to drop the tempting fly\r\n  In the green pool where deep and still the darkling waters lie;\r\n  And if the fishes dare not touch the bait your Highness flings,\r\n  They know that only dragons are a fitting sport for kings._”\r\n\r\nLiu Chi (11th cent. A.D.) was a youth who had gained some\r\nnotoriety by his fondness for strange phraseology, which was much\r\nreprobated by the great Ou-yang Hsiu. When the latter was Grand\r\nExaminer, one of the candidates sent in a doggerel triplet as follows:--\r\n\r\n  “_The universe is in labour,\r\n  All things are produced,\r\n  And among them the Sage._”\r\n\r\n“This must be Liu Chi,” cried Ou-yang, and ran a red-ink pen through\r\nthe composition, adding these two lines:--\r\n\r\n  “_The undergraduate jokes,\r\n  The examiner ploughs._”\r\n\r\nLater on, about the year 1060, Ou-yang was very much struck by the\r\nessay of a certain candidate, and placed him first on the list. When\r\nthe names were read out, he found that the first man was Liu Chi, who\r\nhad changed his name to Liu Yün.\r\n\r\nChang Hsüan-tsu was a wit of the Han dynasty. When he was only eight\r\nyears old, some one laughed at him for having lost several teeth, and\r\nsaid, “What are those dog-holes in your mouth for?” “They are there,”\r\nreplied Chang, “to let puppies like you run in and out.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCollections of wit and humour of the Joe Miller type are often to\r\nbe seen in the hands of Chinese readers, and may be bought at any\r\nbookstall. Like many novels of the cheap and worthless class, not to be\r\nmentioned with the masterpieces of fiction described in this volume,\r\nthese collections are largely unfit for translation. All literature in\r\nChina is pure. Novels and stories are not classed as literature; the\r\nauthors have no desire to attach their names to such works, and the\r\nconsequence is a great falling off from what may be regarded as the\r\nnational standard. Even the _Hung Lou Mêng_ contains episodes which mar\r\nto a considerable extent the beauty of the whole. One excuse is that it\r\nis a novel of real life, and to omit, therefore, the ordinary frailties\r\nof mortals would be to produce an incomplete and inadequate picture.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE HSIAO LIN KUANG CHI]\r\n\r\nThe following are a few specimens of humorous anecdotes taken from the\r\n_Hsiao Lin Kuang Chi_, a modern work in four small volumes, in which\r\nthe stories are classified under twelve heads, such as Arts, Women,\r\nPriests:--\r\n\r\nA bridegroom noticing deep wrinkles on the face of his bride, asked\r\nher how old she was, to which she replied, “About forty-five or\r\nforty-six.” “Your age is stated on the marriage contract,” he rejoined,\r\n“as thirty-eight; but I am sure you are older than that, and you may\r\nas well tell me the truth.” “I am really fifty-four,” answered the\r\nbride. The bridegroom, however, was not satisfied, and determined to\r\nset a trap for her. Accordingly he said, “Oh, by the by, I must just\r\ngo and cover up the salt jar, or the rats will eat every scrap of it.”\r\n“Well, I never!” cried the bride, taken off her guard. “Here I’ve lived\r\nsixty-eight years, and I never before heard of rats stealing salt.”\r\n\r\nA woman who was entertaining a paramour during the absence of her\r\nhusband, was startled by hearing the latter knock at the house-door.\r\nShe hurriedly bundled the man into a rice-sack, which she concealed in\r\na corner of the room; but when her husband came in he caught sight of\r\nit, and asked in a stern voice, “What have you got in that sack?” His\r\nwife was too terrified to answer; and after an awkward pause a voice\r\nfrom the sack was heard to say, “Only rice.”\r\n\r\nA scoundrel who had a deep grudge against a wealthy man, sought out\r\na famous magician and asked for his help. “I can send demon soldiers\r\nand secretly cut him off,” said the magician. “Yes, but his sons and\r\ngrandsons would inherit,” replied the other; “that won’t do.” “I can\r\ndraw down fire from heaven,” said the magician, “and burn his house and\r\nvaluables.” “Even then,” answered the man, “his landed property would\r\nremain; so that won’t do.” “Oh,” cried the magician, “if your hate is\r\nso deep as all that, I have something precious here which, if you can\r\npersuade him to avail himself of it, will bring him and his to utter\r\nsmash.” He thereupon gave to his delighted client a tightly closed\r\npackage, which, on being opened, was seen to contain a pen. “What\r\nspiritual power is there in this?” asked the man. “Ah!” sighed the\r\nmagician, “you evidently do not know how many have been brought to ruin\r\nby the use of this little thing.”\r\n\r\nA doctor who had mismanaged a case was seized by the family and tied\r\nup. In the night he managed to free himself, and escaped by swimming\r\nacross a river. When he got home, he found his son, who had just begun\r\nto study medicine, and said to him, “Don’t be in a hurry with your\r\nbooks; the first and most important thing is to learn to swim.”\r\n\r\nThe King of Purgatory sent his lictors to earth to bring back some\r\nskilful physician. “You must look for one,” said the King, “at whose\r\ndoor there are no aggrieved spirits of disembodied patients.” The\r\nlictors went off, but at the house of every doctor they visited there\r\nwere crowds of wailing ghosts hanging about. At last they found a\r\ndoctor at whose door there was only a single shade, and cried out,\r\n“This man is evidently the skilful one we are in search of.” On\r\ninquiry, however, they discovered that he had only started practice the\r\nday before.\r\n\r\nA general was hard pressed in battle and on the point of giving way,\r\nwhen suddenly a spirit soldier came to his rescue and enabled him\r\nto win a great victory. Prostrating himself on the ground, he asked\r\nthe spirit’s name. “I am the God of the Target,” replied the spirit.\r\n“And how have I merited your godship’s kind assistance?” inquired the\r\ngeneral. “I am grateful to you,” answered the spirit, “because in your\r\ndays of practice you never once hit me.”\r\n\r\nA portrait-painter, who was doing very little business, was advised by\r\na friend to paint a picture of himself and his wife, and to hang it out\r\nin the street as an advertisement. This he did, and shortly afterwards\r\nhis father-in-law came along. Gazing at the picture for some time,\r\nthe latter at length asked, “Who is that woman?” “Why, that is your\r\ndaughter,” replied the artist. “Whatever is she doing,” again inquired\r\nher father, “sitting there with that stranger?”\r\n\r\nA man who had been condemned to wear the _cangue_, or wooden collar,\r\nwas seen by some of his friends. “What have you been doing,” they\r\nasked, “to deserve this?” “Oh, nothing,” he replied; “I only picked up\r\nan old piece of rope.” “And are you to be punished thus severely,” they\r\nsaid, “for merely picking up an end of rope?” “Well,” answered the\r\nman, “the fact is that there was a bullock tied to the other end.”\r\n\r\nA man asked a friend to stay and have tea. Unfortunately there was\r\nno tea in the house, so a servant was sent to borrow some. Before\r\nthe latter had returned the water was already boiling, and it became\r\nnecessary to pour in more cold water. This happened several times, and\r\nat length the boiler was overflowing but no tea had come. Then the\r\nman’s wife said to her husband, “As we don’t seem likely to get any\r\ntea, you had better offer your friend a bath!”\r\n\r\nA monkey, brought after death before the King of Purgatory, begged to\r\nbe reborn on earth as a man. “In that case,” said the King, “all the\r\nhairs must be plucked out of your body,” and he ordered the attendant\r\ndemons to pull them out forthwith. At the very first hair, however, the\r\nmonkey screeched out, and said he could not bear the pain. “You brute!”\r\nroared the King, “how are you to become a man if you cannot even part\r\nwith a single hair?”\r\n\r\nA braggart chess-player played three games with a stranger and lost\r\nthem all. Next day a friend asked him how he had come off. “Oh,” said\r\nhe, “I didn’t win the first game, and my opponent didn’t lose the\r\nsecond. As for the third, I wanted to draw it, but he wouldn’t agree.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PROVERBS]\r\n\r\nThe barest sketch of Chinese literature would hardly be complete\r\nwithout some allusion to its proverbs and maxims. These are not only\r\nto be found largely scattered throughout every branch of writing,\r\nclassical and popular, but may also be studied in collections,\r\ngenerally under a metrical form. Thus the _Ming Hsien Chi_, to take\r\none example, which can be purchased anywhere for about a penny,\r\nconsists of thirty pages of proverbs and the like, arranged in\r\nantithetical couplets of five, six, and seven characters to each line.\r\nChildren are made to learn these by heart, and ordinary grown-up\r\nChinamen may be almost said to think in proverbs. There can be no doubt\r\nthat to the foreigner a large store of proverbs, committed to memory\r\nand judiciously introduced, are a great aid to successful conversation.\r\nThese are a few taken from an inexhaustible supply, omitting to a great\r\nextent such as find a ready equivalent in English:--\r\n\r\nDeal with the faults of others as gently as with your own.\r\n\r\nBy many words wit is exhausted.\r\n\r\nIf you bow at all, bow low.\r\n\r\nIf you take an ox, you must give a horse.\r\n\r\nA man thinks he knows, but a woman knows better.\r\n\r\nWords whispered on earth sound like thunder in heaven.\r\n\r\nIf fortune smiles--who doesn’t? If fortune doesn’t--who does?\r\n\r\nMoneyed men are always listened to.\r\n\r\nNature is better than a middling doctor.\r\n\r\nStay at home and reverence your parents; why travel afar to worship the\r\ngods?\r\n\r\nA bottle-nosed man may be a teetotaller, but no one will think so.\r\n\r\nIt is easier to catch a tiger than to ask a favour.\r\n\r\nWith money you can move the gods; without it, you can’t move a man.\r\n\r\nBend your head if the eaves are low.\r\n\r\nOblige, and you will be obliged.\r\n\r\nDon’t put two saddles on one horse.\r\n\r\nArmies are maintained for years, to be used on a single day.\r\n\r\nIn misfortune, gold is dull; in happiness, iron is bright.\r\n\r\nMore trees are upright than men.\r\n\r\nIf you fear that people will know, don’t do it.\r\n\r\nLong visits bring short compliments.\r\n\r\nIf you are upright and without guile, what god need you pray to for\r\npardon?\r\n\r\nSome study shows the need for more.\r\n\r\nOne kind word will keep you warm for three winters.\r\n\r\nThe highest towers begin from the ground.\r\n\r\nNo needle is sharp at both ends.\r\n\r\nStraight trees are felled first.\r\n\r\nNo image-maker worships the gods. He knows what stuff they are made of.\r\n\r\nHalf an orange tastes as sweet as a whole one.\r\n\r\nWe love our own compositions, but other men’s wives.\r\n\r\nFree sitters at the play always grumble most.\r\n\r\nIt is not the wine which makes a man drunk; it is the man himself.\r\n\r\nBetter a dog in peace than a man in war.\r\n\r\nEvery one gives a shove to the tumbling wall.\r\n\r\nSweep the snow from your own doorstep.\r\n\r\nHe who rides a tiger cannot dismount.\r\n\r\nPoliteness before force.\r\n\r\nOne dog barks at something, and the rest bark at him.\r\n\r\nYou can’t clap hands with one palm.\r\n\r\nDraw your bow, but don’t shoot.\r\n\r\nOne more good man on earth is better than an extra angel in heaven.\r\n\r\nGold is tested by fire; man, by gold.\r\n\r\nThose who have not tasted the bitterest of life’s bitters can never\r\nappreciate the sweetest of life’s sweets.\r\n\r\nMoney makes a blind man see.\r\n\r\nMan is God upon a small scale. God is man upon a large scale.\r\n\r\nA near neighbour is better than a distant relation.\r\n\r\nWithout error there could be no such thing as truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat foreign students have achieved in the department of Chinese\r\nliterature from the sixteenth century down to quite recent times is\r\nwell exhibited in the three large volumes which form the _Bibliotheca\r\nSinica_, or _Dictionnaire Bibliographique des Ouvrages rélatifs à\r\nl’Empire chinois_, by Henri Cordier: Paris, Ernest Leroux, 1878; with\r\nSupplément, 1895. This work is carried out with a fulness and accuracy\r\nwhich leave nothing to be desired, and is essential to all systematic\r\nworkers in the Chinese field.\r\n\r\nBy far the most important of all books mentioned in the above\r\ncollection is a complete translation of the Confucian Canon by the late\r\nDr. James Legge of Aberdeen, under the general title of _The Chinese\r\nClassics_. The publication of this work, which forms the greatest\r\nexisting monument of Anglo-Chinese scholarship, extended from 1861 to\r\n1885.\r\n\r\nThe _Cursus Literaturæ Sinicæ_, by P. Zottoli, S.J., Shanghai,\r\n1879-1882, is an extensive series of translations into Latin from all\r\nbranches of Chinese literature, and is designed especially for the use\r\nof Roman Catholic missionaries (_neo-missionariis accommodatus_).\r\n\r\nAnother very important work, now rapidly approaching completion, is a\r\ntranslation by Professor E. Chavannes, Collège de France, of the famous\r\nhistory described in Book II. chap, iii., under the title of _Les\r\nMémoires Historiques de Se-ma Ts‘ien_, the first volume of which is\r\ndated Paris, 1895.\r\n\r\n_Notes on Chinese Literature_, by A. Wylie, Shanghai, 1867, contains\r\ndescriptive notices of about 2000 separate Chinese works, arranged\r\nunder Classics, History, Philosophy, and Belles Lettres, as in the\r\nImperial Catalogue (see p. 387). Considering the date at which it was\r\nwritten, this book is entitled to rank among the highest efforts of the\r\nkind. It is still of the utmost value to the student, though in need of\r\ncareful revision.\r\n\r\nThe following Catalogues of Chinese libraries in Europe have been\r\npublished in recent years:--\r\n\r\n_Catalogue of Chinese Printed Books, Manuscripts, and Drawings in the\r\nLibrary of the British Museum._ By R. K. Douglas, 1877.\r\n\r\n_Catalogue of the Chinese Translation of the Buddhist Tripitaka._ By\r\nBunyio Nanjio, 1883.\r\n\r\n_Catalogue of the Chinese Books and Manuscripts in the Library of Lord\r\nCrawford, Haigh Hall, Wigan._ By J. P. Edmond, 1895.\r\n\r\n_Catalogue of the Chinese and Manchu Books in the Library of the\r\nUniversity of Cambridge._ By H. A. Giles, 1898.\r\n\r\n_Catalogue des Livres Chinois, Coréens, Japonais, etc._, in the\r\nBibliothèque Nationale. By Maurice Courant, Paris, 1900.
