I made a table of them, and traced their destiny, and the\r\nresult of this research was printed in the First Annual Report of the\r\nMetropolitan Public Gardens Association, which was issued in 1884. I\r\nthen went further, and commenced to draw up a list of all the\r\nburying-places, of which I could find any record, still existing, or\r\nthat had ever existed in London. It was no easy task. A return drawn up\r\nby the late Sir Edwin Chadwick in 1843, for the use of the Parliamentary\r\nCommittee which sat to consider questions relating to the sanitary\r\ncondition of the labouring classes, contains a most valuable, though not\r\nperfectly complete, table of the graveyards in actual use at that date.\r\nThen there are the returns of the grounds closed by order in Council in\r\n1853 and 1854, and still open for interments in 1855, which are also\r\nvery useful. There is a return, dated June, 1833, purporting to show all\r\nthe “Places of Burial belonging to each Parish or Precinct under the\r\nAuthority of the Bishop of London,” and all the “Places of Burial\r\nbelonging to Dissenting Congregations within the Bills of Mortality,”\r\n&c., with their size, and the annual number of burials in them. This,\r\nwhen I found it, I thought would be a great treasure, but I soon\r\ndiscovered such entries as the following: “Three letters have been\r\naddressed to the Officiating Ministers of the parishes of St. Benet,\r\nGracechurch, St. Martin, Ludgate, and St. Margaret, Westminster,\r\nrespectively; but no return has been received from either.” “The united\r\nparishes of Allhallows, Bread Street, and St. John the Evangelist, not\r\nbeing under the authority of the Bishop of London, I have not any return\r\nto make.” “I beg to add that there are several other places used as\r\nburial-grounds in this parish (Stepney) belonging to Jews, Dissenters,\r\nand others, of which I have no official cognizance, and to which, in\r\nfact, I have no access,” &c. And with regard, generally, to the second\r\npart of the return, the following simple remark is made: “The Secretary\r\nof State is not able to ascertain the Places of Burial belonging to\r\nDissenting congregations within the Bills of Mortality.” In 1839 Walker\r\ndescribed the condition of 47 of the most crowded metropolitan places of\r\ninterment, and the Parliamentary Committee which sat in 1842 heard\r\nevidence about these and some others. In Maitland’s “History of London”\r\nthere is a list of 64 burial-places used in the year 1729, and not\r\nincluded in the Bills of Mortality. Some of these are outside London,\r\nand some are only vaults under buildings. I have also kept a list of\r\nabout fifty books which I found of use, although in many of them only a\r\nfew burial-grounds are mentioned or described. And this, with the\r\naddition of various ancient and modern maps and plans of London and its\r\nenvirons, is the material upon which I have had to work. But as it is\r\nnever safe to take anything on trust, nothing but actual perambulations\r\nand inquiries on the spot could show the present size and condition of\r\nthe burial-grounds, and even several that are marked on the ordnance\r\nmaps have been built upon since they were published, as, for instance,\r\nthe German ground in the Savoy, the additional ground to St. Martin’s in\r\nthe Fields, and Thomas’ ground in Golden Lane, all of which have\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nI have had some curious experiences while graveyard-hunting. At first I\r\nwas less bold than I am now, and was hardly prepared to walk straight\r\ninto private yards and look round them until asked my business and\r\ndriven to retire. “My business” it is best not to reveal ordinarily. If\r\none mentions that one is looking at a place because it was once a\r\nburial-ground the fact will generally be stoutly denied, and sometimes\r\nin good faith. But it is not unusual for an employé innocently to\r\nacknowledge that there are bones under the ground upon which he is\r\nstanding, whereat his master, if he knew of it, would be very angry. For\r\nit must be remembered that it is to the interest of the owner of a yard\r\nto keep the circumstance of its having been used for interments in the\r\nbackground, and he is not pleased if, when he wants to put up a wall or\r\nenlarge a shed, he is stopped from doing so by the enforcement of the\r\nDisused Burial-Grounds Act of 1834, as amended by the Open Spaces Act of\r\n1887.\r\n\r\nI inquired of an old man once, in a court in Shoreditch, whether he\r\nremembered a graveyard existing by the workhouse.\r\n\r\n“No,” he said.\r\n\r\nI noticed a newer part of the building, evidently a recently erected\r\nwing, and asked him how long it had been built.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I moind,” said he, “when they was buildin’ that, they carted away a\r\nton of bones.” Here was the evidence I was seeking for.\r\n\r\nOne day a sleepy old Smithfield butcher, whose work-time was the night,\r\nand whose sleeping-time was the morning, was specially kept awake until\r\n10 o’clock in order to see me, as he could remember the extent of a\r\ncertain burial-ground before it was done away with. The information he\r\nwas able to supply was very useful, but it was hard to keep him to the\r\npoint, as the poor old man, once roused to remember the past, would\r\npersistently revert to the cottages which used to stand on the adjoining\r\nplot of land, and which ought, he said, to have come into his own\r\npossession if he had not been in some way defrauded out of his lawful\r\ninheritance.\r\n\r\nIt is often necessary, in order to see a graveyard, to go into one of\r\nthe surrounding houses and ask for permission to look out from a back\r\nwindow. Such permission is sometimes refused at once, sometimes it is\r\nmost kindly given. I remember arousing a divided opinion upon this\r\nmatter by knocking at the door of one of the upper rooms in the\r\nalmshouses in Bath Street. I wanted to see the ground used as a garden\r\nby the inmates of the St. Luke’s Lunatic Asylum in Old Street, and which\r\nwas at one time a pauper burial-ground for the parish. The old man did\r\nnot at all like my invading his room, but the old lady was most affable,\r\nand had much to say upon the subject. At any rate I saw what I wanted,\r\nand made my mental report, but I left the old man grumbling at my\r\nunnecessary intrusion, and the old lady in smiles. I hope she did not\r\nsuffer for her kindness.\r\n\r\nIf one asks to go into a burial-ground, it is generally imagined that\r\none wants to see a particular grave. I have been supposed to have “some\r\none lyin’ there” in all quarters of the metropolis, and in all sorts of\r\nfunny little places. I have been hailed as a sister by the quietest of\r\nQuakeresses and the darkest of bewigged Jewesses, by the leanest and\r\nmost clean-shaven of ritualistic Priests, and by the bearded and buxom\r\nDissenter. I remember, however, knocking at the gate of one Jewish\r\nground which the caretaker was unwilling to let me enter. She asked me\r\nthe direct question, “Are you a Jewess?” I had to say no, but happily I\r\nwas armed with the name of a gentleman who had kindly told me to mention\r\nit in any such difficulty. It answered, and I was allowed in. One day I\r\nclimbed a high, rickety fence in a builder’s yard in Wandsworth in order\r\nto see over the wall into the Friends’ burial-ground. No doubt the men\r\nin the place thought me mad,—anyhow they left me in peace.\r\n\r\nI have often been assured that there is no possibility of a particular\r\nenclosure ever becoming a public garden by those who live, at a low\r\nrent, in the neighbouring cottage, on condition that they keep watch\r\nover the ground. Alas, before many months are over, they find that the\r\nwires have been pulled somehow or other, and that their precious yard is\r\nno longer available for their fowls to run in or for their clothes to\r\ndry in, but is invaded by their neighbours and their neighbour’s\r\nunwelcome children. “They come four times a year to clear away the\r\nweeds.” That is the sort of caretaking that some burial-grounds are\r\nsubjected to; and on the other 361 days in the year all sorts of rubbish\r\nis deposited in them.\r\n\r\nTwice I have had mud thrown at me, once by a woman in Cable Street, E.,\r\nand once by a man in Silchester Road, W., but these were wholly\r\nunprovoked attacks, in fact mere accidental occurrences. For my general\r\nexperience has been of the greatest consideration and politeness. I have\r\nnever been out of my way for the sake of idle curiosity, but have not\r\nhesitated to go down any street or court or to knock at any door which\r\nwas in my way, and I have never had cause to regret it. An appearance of\r\nutter insignificance and an air of knowing where you are going and what\r\nyou want, is the passport for all parts of London; and I have seen young\r\nmen and maidens, one moment indulging in the roughest play, the next\r\nmoment step off the pavement to let me pass. The clergy and others\r\nalways seem to think their own people the very worst. “You don’t know\r\nwhat this neighbourhood is like,” I have heard over and over again, and\r\nI am thankful I don’t. But as far as a superficial knowledge of the\r\nstreets goes they seem to be all much the same—north, south, east, and\r\nwest—and their frequenters too. To the children, at any rate, one need\r\nnever mind speaking. Poor little souls; they say “Miss,” or “Mum,” or\r\n“Missus,” or “Teacher,” or “Sister,” or “Lady,” but they never answer\r\nrudely.\r\n\r\nGravediggers and gardeners in cemeteries are generally communicative\r\npeople, who do not at all mind stopping their work for a bit, and\r\nenlarging on the number of funerals, &c., which they daily witness. They\r\nspeak of the actual headstones and monuments by the surnames engraved\r\nthereon, as, for instance, “Brown,” “Smith,” &c., and will point out a\r\nparticular grave as “four behind Smith over there, Smith is the tall\r\nstone by the path; or if you look next to Wallace which has the shrub on\r\nit,” and so on.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to trace on maps of different dates the rise and fall\r\nof a graveyard. First there is the actual field, which on some\r\nparticular day was acquired for the purpose. Then there is the\r\nburial-ground formed and in use. Then the plot appears to be vacant—put\r\nto no purpose, or used as a yard. Lastly buildings are on it, and the\r\ngraveyard has quite disappeared. One difficulty to be encountered needs\r\nmuch study to overcome; it is the different names by which the same\r\nground is called in different books or plans. For instance, Chadwick\r\nmentions in his list one called St. John’s, Borough, whereas the proper\r\nname for this same ground is Butler’s burial-ground, Horselydown. As\r\nanother instance, and there are scores, it may be mentioned that the\r\nPeel Grove burial-ground was called in some returns the North-east\r\nLondon Cemetery, in others Cambridge Heath burial-ground, and in others\r\nKeldy’s ground. Occasionally a graveyard is described as being “near the\r\nfree school,” or in some such vague terms, and it needs a knowledge of\r\nthe districts and the buildings in them, past and present, to be able to\r\nlocate some of these grounds which I have ventured to call “obscure.”\r\n\r\nSince 1883, as complete a list as I could make of the London\r\nburial-grounds has appeared in the Reports of the Metropolitan Public\r\nGardens Association, and I have, from time to time, been asked for\r\ninformation about the more obscure ones. In the summer of 1894 the\r\nLondon County Council instructed its Parks Committee to make a return of\r\nall the burial-grounds existing in the County of London, with their\r\nsize, ownership, and condition. Having been applied to for information\r\nand assistance, I offered to undertake the work. It involved some\r\nadditional research at the British Museum, and a fresh perambulation.\r\nThe offer being accepted I commenced the task in February, 1895, and\r\nsent in the return in June, accompanied by 60 sheets of the ordnance\r\nsurvey (25 inch to the mile), upon which the grounds were marked in\r\ncolours, viz., those still in use blue, those disused green, those\r\nconverted into public recreation grounds green with a red border. I gave\r\nthe number existing in the County and City of London as 362, of which 41\r\nwere still in use, and 90 were public gardens and playgrounds. This did\r\nnot include churches and chapels with vaults under them, but without\r\ngraveyards. It must also be remembered that the area was strictly\r\nlimited (as it is in this work) to that of the metropolitan boroughs, or\r\nthe administrative County of London with the City. The cemeteries in the\r\ncounty do not represent all the parochial ones. There are, for instance,\r\nthose of St. George’s, Hanover Square, and Kensington at Hanwell, the\r\nPaddington Cemetery in Kilburn, the Jewish at Willesden, and very many\r\nmore just outside the boundary, not to speak of a large number in what\r\nis called “London over the Border,” which to all intents and purposes is\r\nstill London, although separated by the River Lea, and governed by the\r\nWest Ham Corporation.\r\n\r\nThe kindly notice taken of the return, which was published by the\r\nCouncil in October, 1895, has encouraged me to prepare the present\r\nvolume, in which there is scope for a general view of the subject, for\r\nfurther historical details, and for particulars of those grounds which\r\nno longer exist.\r\n\r\nThe more public interest is brought to bear upon the burial-grounds, the\r\nmore likely is it that they will be preserved from encroachments. The\r\nLondon County Council has special powers to put in force the provisions\r\nof the Disused Burial-grounds Act, and it has the record of their actual\r\nsites on the plans prepared by me. It is for the public to see that\r\nthese provisions are carried out, not only for historical, sentimental,\r\nand sanitary reasons, but also because each burial-ground that is\r\ncurtailed or annihilated means the loss of another space which may one\r\nday be available for public recreation; and considering that land, even\r\nin the poorest part of Whitechapel, fetches about £30,000 per acre, it\r\nis easily understood of what inestimable value is a plot of ground which\r\ncannot be built upon.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n                    BRITISH AND ROMAN BURIAL-PLACES.\r\n\r\n             “Where now the haughty Empire that was spread\r\n              With such fond hope? Her very speech is dead.”\r\n                                         WORDSWORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVERY chronicler of London history who can lay claim to be called an\r\nantiquarian, from Fitzstephen, Stow, and Pennant, to the Rev. W. J.\r\nLoftie and Sir Walter Besant, has tried to gather up the fragmentary\r\nevidence which from time to time has come to light, and to form some\r\npicture of the condition of London in the earliest times. Many have gone\r\nin largely for invention, and have weaved what they supposed to be\r\ncircumstantial stories from discoveries of the most trivial kind, but\r\nthese fictions are not worthy of repetition. As it is only with the\r\nevidences of the places of interment in London that this chapter has to\r\ndeal, it is not possible to go into the question of the Roman roads,\r\nwalls, villas, gardens and camps, of which traces have been found,\r\nalthough these relics really form the most interesting of the ancient\r\nremains, or “remarkables” as Maitland calls them, belonging to the\r\nseveral parishes.\r\n\r\nA few tumuli scattered over London are supposed to mark the sites of\r\nBritish burial-places, Stukeley imagined he had discovered one by Long\r\nAcre, but the evidence is not trustworthy. Certainly there are some\r\nartificial mounds in Greenwich Park, which were opened in 1804 by the\r\nRev. James Douglas, and found to contain spear-heads, beads, pieces of\r\ncloth, hair, &c., and there is the well-known one in Parliament Hill\r\nFields, Hampstead, which the London County Council excavated in 1894.\r\nFrom the few broken pieces of human workmanship which were brought to\r\nlight in this excavation, it was conjectured that the mound was an\r\nancient British burial-place of the early bronze period, but no\r\nparticular name can be associated with it. It is now railed round for\r\nits better protection, and planted with shrubs.\r\n\r\nThe Romans buried their dead outside their cities, often on each side of\r\nthe highways immediately beyond the walls and gates, and they adopted\r\nthis plan, to a certain extent, in Britain. But it must be remembered\r\nthat Roman London, as first designed and built, was far smaller than\r\nthat which is enclosed within the line of the city wall of which\r\nfragments still remain, and therefore some sepulchral monuments have\r\nbeen discovered inside this wall and its gates, as, for instance, near\r\nSt. Martin’s, Ludgate, in St. Paul’s Churchyard, in Camomile Street and\r\nLombard Street, and by the churches of St. Mary at Hill and St.\r\nDunstan’s in the East. Near Dowgate some excavations made by Wren\r\nbrought to light what were then thought to be British graves, but as\r\nthere were Roman urns at a still lower level the matter was rather\r\ndifficult of solution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TUMULUS AT HAMPSTEAD.]\r\n\r\nThe largest number of sepulchral remains have been found on the east\r\nside of the City, commencing at Bishopsgate and Moorfields, and\r\nextending to Wapping on the south, and Sun Tavern Fields, Shadwell, on\r\nthe east; and it is not improbable that a cemetery of considerable size\r\noccupied all this district in Roman times. In 1756 many earthen urns,\r\ncontaining ashes, burnt human bones, and coins, were dug up in a field\r\n“called Lottesworth, now Spitalfield,” close to the present site of\r\nChrist Church, Spitalfields, together with some stone coffins and\r\nremnants of wooden ones which probably dated from British or Saxon\r\ntimes; and on many occasions during the last century, urns,\r\nlachrymatories, monumental stones, &c., were discovered in different\r\nspots in the district above mentioned. In many cases the monumental\r\nstones were erected to the memory of soldiers from various legions of\r\nthe army, and on a few of them the inscriptions are still legible. Some\r\nof the Roman remains discovered in London are in the Guildhall Museum;\r\nthe one represented in the accompanying picture, which was found near\r\nLudgate, is with the Arundel marbles at Oxford. A few single graves have\r\nbeen identified among the traces of the gardens and villas which\r\nimmediately surrounded the Roman Fort.\r\n\r\nThe following description of what Sir Christopher Wren found in St.\r\nPaul’s Churchyard, on the north side of the Cathedral, is interesting.\r\n“Upon digging the foundation of the present fabrick of St. Paul’s, he\r\nfound under the graves of the latter ages, in a row below them, the\r\nBurial-places of the Saxon times—the Saxons, as it appeared, were\r\naccustomed to line their graves with chalk-stones, though some more\r\neminent were entombed in coffins of whole stones. Below these were\r\nBritish graves, where were found ivory and wooden pins, of a hard wood,\r\nseemingly box, in abundance, of about six inches long; it seems the\r\nbodies were only wrapped up, and pinned in woollen shrouds, which being\r\nconsumed, the pins remained entire. In the same row, and deeper, were\r\nRoman urns intermixed. This was eighteen feet deep or more, and belonged\r\nto the colony when Romans and Britons lived and died together.” (From\r\nWren’s “Parentalia.”) The remains found in the north-east corner of the\r\nchurchyard were the best preserved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROMAN MONUMENT.]\r\n\r\nSome evidences of a Roman cemetery have also been discovered on the\r\nsouth side of the Thames, in Snow’s Fields, Bermondsey, Union Street,\r\nNewington, and the burial-ground in Deverell Street. This district was\r\nprobably the place of interment for those who lived in the small suburb\r\nwhich was growing up on the south side of the Bridge or Ferry. On\r\nBlackheath there have also been found traces of Roman burial, and in\r\n1803 several urns were dug up in the Earl of Dartmouth’s garden, but\r\nthey were supposed by some authorities to be the remains of the Danes\r\nwho were encamped in that neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nSuch are the very scanty traces that have hitherto been brought to light\r\nrelating to the burial-places of those who were amongst the worthiest\r\npioneers in the making of London, and who occupied it before the time of\r\nthe Christians who founded the earlier priories and churches. For as\r\nsoon as these Christian institutions were established, it became the\r\npractice to bury the dead inside them or around them, and the cloisters\r\nand burial-grounds of the priories, and the churchyards and vaults of\r\nthe churches, took the place of the more distant cemeteries and the more\r\nscattered graves.\r\n\r\nRoman London is buried with British, Saxon, and Danish London, far below\r\nthe surface of nineteenth-century London, and Longfellow might have been\r\nwriting its epitaph when he described the ruins under the sea—\r\n\r\n                    “Hidden from all mortal eyes\r\n                     Deep the sunken city lies;\r\n                     Even cities have their graves!”\r\n\r\nThe dedications of the London churches mark historical periods, and\r\nthere are a few names, such as St. Olave and St. Magnus, which are of\r\nDanish derivation, but of the Danish interments in London very few\r\ntraces remain. Beyond the remnants found at Blackheath, and the belief\r\nheld by some chroniclers that the church of St. Clement Danes was so\r\nnamed because it stood in a plot of ground where the Danes were buried,\r\nonly one discovery of any importance has been made. On the south side of\r\nSt. Paul’s Churchyard, in digging the foundation for a new warehouse a\r\nfew years ago, a relic was found with the following Runic inscription on\r\nit, which Mr. Loftie thinks must have belonged to an early stage of the\r\nDanish conquest, “Kina caused this stone to be laid over Tuki.” A\r\ntradition used to prevail in Fulham that human remains, which have been\r\ndiscovered at different times in the neighbourhood of the river, were\r\nsurvivals of the Danish invasion, although the actual skeletons found\r\nthere in 1809 (on the property of the Earl of Cholmondeley) seemed, from\r\ncoins, daggers, &c., which were with them, to belong to the time of\r\nCharles I.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                THE GRAVEYARDS OF PRIORIES AND CONVENTS.\r\n\r\n                “Gone are all the barons bold,\r\n                   Gone are all the knights and squires,\r\n                 Gone the Abbot stern and cold,\r\n                   And the brotherhood of friars;\r\n                      Not a name\r\n                      Remains to fame,\r\n                 From those mouldering days of old!”\r\n                               LONGFELLOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nFITZSTEPHEN’S statement that “there are in London and the suburbs 13\r\nchurches belonging to convents, besides 126 lesser parish churches,” is\r\nnot a very satisfactory one, as he does not proceed to name these\r\nseveral churches, or to tell his readers with what establishments they\r\nwere connected. However, he was probably under the mark in putting the\r\nfirst figure at thirteen, for even in his time, and certainly very\r\nlittle later, there were many more than thirteen monastic and conventual\r\nbuildings in London, and each had its church or chapel. The chief\r\namongst these establishments which existed in London in the twelfth\r\ncentury, and which were made between that time and the dissolution of\r\nthe priories in the days of Henry VIII., were:—\r\n\r\n                        _Inside the City Walls._\r\n\r\n1. The Greyfriars or Franciscans, succeeded by Christ’s Hospital.\r\n\r\n2. The Blackfriars or Dominicans in the west.\r\n\r\n3. The Crossed or Crutched Friars, by Fenchurch Street.\r\n\r\n4. The Augustine Friars, by Broad Street.\r\n\r\n5. St. Helen’s Priory of Nuns, Bishopsgate Street.\r\n\r\n6. The Priory of Holy Trinity, Aldgate.\r\n\r\n7. The Priory and Sanctuary of St. Martin’s le Grand.\r\n\r\n8. Elsing Spital, London Wall.\r\n\r\n9. The Priory of St. Augustine Papey.\r\n\r\n10. St. James’s Priory, the Hermitage in the Wall, Monkswell Street.\r\n\r\n11. The Priory of St. Thomas Acon, Ironmonger Lane.\r\n\r\n12. The Fraternities who had the care of St. Paul’s Cathedral, including\r\nthe brotherhood of All Souls, specially connected with the Charnel\r\nChapel.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Outside the City Walls._\r\n\r\n13. The Whitefriars or Carmelites, south of Fleet Street.\r\n\r\n14. The Abbey and the Convent of Westminster.\r\n\r\n15. A Brotherhood of St. Ursula at St. Mary le Strand.\r\n\r\n16. A Brotherhood of the Trinity, without Aldersgate.\r\n\r\n17. The Knights Templars, in the Strand.\r\n\r\n18. The Priory of the Knights Hospitallers of St. John of Jerusalem, at\r\nClerkenwell.\r\n\r\n19. The Black Nuns of St. Mary’s, Clerkenwell.\r\n\r\n20. The Benedictine Priory of St. Bartholomew, with St. Bartholomew’s\r\nSpital, West Smithfield.\r\n\r\n21. The Carthusian Priory of the Salutation, subsequently the\r\nCharterhouse.\r\n\r\n22. St. Mary Spital, without Bishopsgate.\r\n\r\n23. The Nunnery of the Minoresses of St. Clare, the Minories.\r\n\r\n24. The Cistercian Abbey of St. Mary of Grace, beyond the Tower.\r\n\r\n25. St. Katharine’s Hospital, by the Tower.\r\n\r\n26. The Convent of St. Leonard, at Bromley-by-Bow.\r\n\r\n27. The Priory of St. Mary Overie, Southwark, with a “House of Sisters.”\r\n\r\n28. Bermondsey Abbey.\r\n\r\n29. The Nunnery of St. John the Baptist, Holywell.\r\n\r\n30. The Convent of St. Mary Rounceval, Charing Cross.\r\n\r\nA very complete list of the ecclesiastical institutions will be found in\r\nBrewer’s “Beauties of London and Middlesex,” vol. ii. p. 39.\r\n\r\nSome of these brotherhoods were but small, and were mendicants; and they\r\nmay not have had special burial-places of their own. In other cases\r\nburials may have only taken place in the priory churches, which were\r\nalways much sought after for the purpose by outsiders, or in the\r\ncloisters. But most of the conventual establishments had a cemetery of\r\nconsiderable size—“the cloister garth,” and peeps are given us now and\r\nthen, by old writers, of the practices at the burial of the monks and\r\nnuns.\r\n\r\nIn the Church of the Crutched friars were two Dutch Fraternities, one of\r\nwhich was named in honour of the “Holy Blode of Wilsuak,” and among\r\ntheir rules and orders is the following:—\r\n\r\n“Also when any Brother or Suster of the same Bretherhede is dede, he or\r\nshe shall have 4 Torchys of Wex of the Bretherhede, to bring the Body in\r\nErthe: And every Brother and Suster shall come to his Masse of Requiem,\r\nand offer 1d and abide still to the Tyme the Body be buryed, uppon Pain\r\nof a l. Wex, yf he or she be within the Cite.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BURIAL OF A MONK.\r\n(_From a Harleian Manuscript_).]\r\n\r\nBurials did not always take place in the evening, as might be imagined\r\nfrom the mention of torches and tapers, but often after mass, before\r\ndinner, and always with as little delay as possible. The written\r\nabsolution was placed on the body of the monk or nun, and buried with\r\nit. Very solemn they seem to have been, these monastic funerals,\r\nespecially when the body to be buried was that of an abbot, a prior, or\r\na canon, with the procession of monks, the lighted tapers, the\r\nsprinkling of holy water, the chanting of psalms, the singing of the\r\nrequiem mass, and the ringing of the bell. Strype gives a detailed\r\naccount of the finding of four heads in pots or cases of “fine pewter,”\r\nin a cupboard in the wall of the demolished building which belonged to\r\nthe Black friars, when the rubbish was cleared away after the Great Fire\r\nof London. They were embalmed or preserved, and had tonsured hair. He\r\nimagined that they were the heads of “some zealous priests or friars,\r\nexecuted for treason ... or for denying the King’s Supremacy; and here\r\nprivately deposited by these Black Friars.” It is probable that these\r\nheads were afterwards bought and taken to the Continent to be exhibited\r\nas holy relics. The City must have been a strange place in the\r\nthirteenth century, with the numerous churches and the very large\r\npriories and convents hedged in by narrow streets of wooden houses,\r\nwhere, even in those early days, men were busy, in their own several\r\nmanners, in getting money. Neither the monks, nor the nuns, nor the\r\nmendicant friars were always exemplary in their behaviour, but at any\r\nrate the charitable works done at that time—the care of the sick, the\r\nprayers for the evil, the prayers for the souls of the dead, the\r\nbuilding of the churches and the hospitals—were carried out by them, and\r\nwe cannot imagine how we could have got on in our matter-of-fact\r\ngeneration without their efforts and their work. It is also pleasant to\r\nlook back occasionally and to try and picture the life led in the more\r\nsecluded priories outside the City, surrounded by fields and close to\r\nthe Holy Wells, where there was time for prayer and meditation and good\r\ndeeds.\r\n\r\n              “Yes, they can make, who fail to find,\r\n                 Short leizure even in busiest days;\r\n               Moments, to cast a look behind,\r\n                 And profit by those kindly rays\r\n               That through the clouds do sometimes steal,\r\n               And all the far-off past reveal.”\r\n\r\nOf the cloister garths there is very little which remains intact. The\r\nburial-ground of the Greyfriars is now the quadrangle of Christ’s\r\nHospital, but few traces of the old cloisters are left there. Of the\r\ngrounds attached to Westminster Abbey I shall speak in the next chapter.\r\nThat of St. Bartholomew’s Priory, West Smithfield, was built upon many\r\nyears ago. The site of the priory cemetery and that of the canons are\r\nmarked on the accompanying plan, but\r\n\r\n                 “Time has long effaced the inscriptions\r\n                   On the cloister’s funeral stones,”\r\n\r\n\r\nand nothing is left to us except glimpses of the customs which used to\r\ntake place there. The history of the establishment, founded by Rahere\r\nabout 1113, is comparatively well known, owing to the recent efforts\r\nthat have been made to restore what is left of the noble Norman Church.\r\nBut there is not much remaining of what was once an extensive group of\r\nbuildings except the choir of the original church, with its restored\r\nlady-chapel, crypt, and transepts. The nave has gone, and its site is\r\nmarked by the churchyard, the bases of the pillars being buried among\r\nthe bones. Leading out of the south transept is the “green-ground,”\r\nanother small churchyard, and a paved yard on the north side of the\r\nchurch was once the pauper ground.\r\n\r\nAccording to a writer in the _Observator_ of August 21, 1703, the\r\ncloisters of the priory and the space which still existed there became\r\nthe resort of very low characters, “lords and ladies, aldermen and their\r\nwives, squires and fiddlers, citizens and rope-dancers, jackpuddings and\r\nlawyers, mistresses and maids, masters and ’prentices” meeting there for\r\nlotteries, plays, farces, and “all the temptations to destruction.” Stow\r\ndescribes far more respectable gatherings in “the churchyard of St.\r\nBartholomew,” when the scholars from St. Paul’s, Westminster, and other\r\ngrammar schools used to meet for learned disputations, for proficiency\r\nin which garlands and prizes were awarded; but these meetings finally\r\ndegenerated into free fights in the streets, and had to be discontinued.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Priory Church of St. Bartholomew The Great.]\r\n\r\nSome of the priory burial-grounds have survived in the parish\r\nchurchyards, or at any rate parts of them have. The churchyard of St.\r\nCatherine Cree, in Leadenhall Street, is the successor of the\r\nburial-ground of Holy Trinity Priory, the church itself having been\r\nbuilt in this cemetery. It was originally called Christ Church, which\r\ngot corrupted to Cree Church, and so on. The churchyard is associated\r\nwith the performance of miracle plays, moralities, or mysteries, and it\r\nwas probably in this place that some of the latest of these shows were\r\nheld. They are frequently mentioned by different chroniclers from the\r\ntenth to the sixteenth centuries. Such events as the Massacre of the\r\nInnocents, the Shepherds feeding their flocks on Christmas Eve, and the\r\nscenes in the history of St. Catherine, &c., were usually portrayed\r\ninside the churches; but Bishop Bonner put a stop to this practice in\r\n1542, after which time stages were erected by strolling players in\r\nstreets, by the wells, and in private houses. In London the churchyards\r\nseem to have been frequently used for the purpose, and in an old parish\r\nbook belonging to St. Catherine’s was the following entry, quoted in\r\n“Londinium Redivivum”:—“Receyved of Hugh Grymes, for lycens geven to\r\ncerten players to playe their enterludes in the churche-yarde from the\r\nfeast of Easter, An. D’ni. 1560, untyll the feaste of Seynt Mychaell\r\nTharchangell next comynge, every holydaye, to the use of the parysshe,\r\nthe some of 27s and 8d.” The miracle plays were a prelude to a more\r\nadvanced form of dramatic representation, and after the establishment of\r\nthe theatres we hear no more of them. The modern “flower service”\r\noriginated, I believe, in the church of St. Catherine Cree, having been\r\ninstituted by Dr. Whittemore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\nS. EAST            S. WEST\r\nVIEW OF THE CRYPT ON THE SITE OF THE LATE COLLEGE OF\r\nSt. MARTIN LE GRAND.\r\n_Discovered in clearing for the New Post Office_\r\nTHE CRYPT OF ST. MARTIN LE GRAND IN 1818.]\r\n\r\nRecent discoveries have shown that the priory cloister of the Augustine\r\nFriars was immediately to the north-east of the Dutch Church in Austin\r\nFriars. St. James’s Priory, the Hermitage in the Wall, had a graveyard\r\nunder the wall, on the other side of which was, and is, the churchyard\r\nof St. Giles’, Cripplegate. Huge warehouses and offices now cover its\r\nsite. The burial-ground of the Priory of St. Thomas Acon, in Ironmonger\r\nLane, where pilgrims were buried who died on their visits to the chapel\r\nin honour of Becket, has also disappeared; but that of the priory of St.\r\nAugustine Papey survives in the little churchyard of St. Martin Outwich,\r\nin Camomile Street, which was presented to the parish by Robert Hyde in\r\n1538, while the nuns of St. Helen’s were probably buried in what is now\r\nSt. Helen’s Churchyard, Bishopsgate Street, which used to be, according\r\nto Stow, much larger.\r\n\r\nNo trace is left of the burial-places of the monks of Elsing Spital, the\r\nCrutched Friars, the White Friars, or the Black Friars, or of that of\r\nthe splendid priory and sanctuary of St. Martin le Grand; they have gone\r\nwith the buildings, of which only slight traces remain here and there,\r\nsuch as the porch of St. Alphege, London Wall, which belonged to Elsing\r\nSpital Priory. Probably they all had burying-grounds within their\r\nprecincts. The crypt of St. Martin’s was opened out in 1818, and a very\r\nperfect stone coffin found in it, when the present Post Office Buildings\r\nin Foster Lane were erected. The churches themselves were always much\r\nresorted to as places of interment by those who were not connected with\r\nthe priories, especially the four magnificent churches, all of which are\r\nnow gone, of the Greyfriars, the Whitefriars, the Blackfriars, and the\r\nAugustine Friars. The Dutch church is the successor to the nave of the\r\nlast named. The site of the Greyfriars’ church is occupied by the\r\npresent church and churchyard of Christ Church, Newgate Street. Here\r\nwere buried Margaret, second wife of Edward I., Isabella, Widow of\r\nEdward II., Joan Makepeace, wife of David Bruce, King of Scotland, and\r\nIsabella, wife of Lord Fitzwalter, the Queen of Man, besides the hearts\r\nof Edward II. and Queen Eleanor, the wife of Henry III., and, according\r\nto Weever, the bodies of “four duchesses, four countesses, one duke,\r\ntwenty-eight barons, and some thirty-five knights,” in all “six hundred\r\nand sixty-three persons of quality.” Malcolm states that ten tombs and\r\n140 gravestones (the fine monuments at the east end of the church) were\r\ndestroyed and sold, in 1545, by Sir Martin Bowes, Lord Mayor, for fifty\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nI have given a list of the principal convents and priories outside the\r\ncity. The site of St. Katharine’s is buried in the Dock, and that of St.\r\nJohn the Baptist’s, Holywell (by Curtain Road, Shoreditch), has also\r\ngone. The churchyards of St. Mary, Bromley, and St. Saviour, Southwark,\r\nare the survivals of the conventual burying-places; the cemetery of the\r\nnuns at Bromley was on the south side of the church, and upon its site\r\nSir John Jacob built the Manor House, the bones being put under the\r\nhouse. But about two hundred years later (1813) the greater part of this\r\nsite was again added to the churchyard, and re-consecrated. The\r\nburial-ground of Westminster Convent, with the Abbot’s garden, have\r\ngiven place to the district and market of Covent Garden. The houses in\r\nWhite Lion Street and Spital Square are on the site of the cemetery or\r\ngarth of St. Mary Spital. Here, after it ceased to be used for\r\ninterments and before it was built upon, Spital Square was an open plot\r\nof ground with a pulpit in it and a house for the accommodation of the\r\nLord Mayor and Corporation when they came on their annual visit to hear\r\nthe “Spital Sermon.” Of the priory church of the Knights Hospitallers of\r\nSt. John of Jerusalem, in Clerkenwell, very few traces remain. The\r\nbeautiful old crypt, lately cleared of coffins and restored, is older\r\nthan the priory church (which was built over it), and dates from 1080 or\r\n1090. The truly magnificent church was consecrated in 1185, the present\r\nstructure occupying merely the site of the choir, the nave having\r\nprobably extended the length of St. John’s Square, and, together with\r\nthe other buildings of the priory, it was pulled down at the\r\nDissolution. The exact site of the cloisters and burial-ground is\r\nunknown. The present churchyard of St. John’s is a small, narrow one at\r\nthe eastern end, from which steps lead down into the ancient crypt.\r\nHere, between the years 1738 and 1853, about 325 bodies were buried, or\r\nrather the coffins were stacked, for they were above the floor. In 1893\r\na faculty was procured for their removal, and all the remains were\r\nreverently conveyed to Woking, a vellum document recording the fact\r\nbeing placed in the vestry of the church. The crypt is open to the\r\npublic on the first Saturday in each month. Its complete restoration is\r\nstill in hand. I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. H. W. Fincham for\r\nthe picture of St. John’s Crypt, and also for that of the garden in\r\nBenjamin Street, E.C.\r\n\r\nThe Nuns’ burial-ground at Clerkenwell, and part of the beautiful\r\ncloister, existed until about one hundred years ago in the garden of the\r\nDuke of Newcastle’s house, and its site is now occupied by the houses on\r\nthe west side of St. James’s Walk, a little north-east of St. James’s\r\nChurch. The Convent of St. Mary Rounceval was superseded by\r\nNorthumberland House, subsequently pulled down when Northumberland\r\nAvenue was made; and the churchyard of Holy Trinity, Minories (now\r\nmerely a part of the road) _may_ be a relic of the Nunnery of the\r\nMinoresses of St. Clare. The Priory Church of St. Mary Overie (over the\r\nferry) was purchased from the king by the parish in 1539, and has since\r\nbeen the parish Church of St. Saviour, Southwark, henceforth to be the\r\nCathedral of South London.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CRYPT OF ST. JOHN’S, CLERKENWELL.]\r\n\r\nIn the Crace Collection at the British Museum there is a plan, made by\r\nWilliam Newton, purporting to show London in Elizabeth’s time, in\r\npicture form. He marks the priories with their burial-grounds, but I\r\ndoubt if it is very trustworthy. In Van den Wyngaerde’s beautiful view\r\n(1550), reproduced by the Topographical Society in 1881, and the\r\noriginal of which is in the Bodleian Library, several of the conventual\r\nchurches appear, not the least interesting being that of “S. Maria\r\nSpital.”\r\n\r\nThe Cistercian abbey of St. Mary of Grace and the Carthusian priory of\r\nthe Salutation were built on plague burial-grounds. (See Chapter VI.)\r\nThe former has disappeared under the site of the Royal Mint, the latter\r\nsurvives in the Charterhouse. Probably they were very insanitary, but\r\nsuch, according to Dean Farrar, was the case with all the conventual\r\nestablishments, and much accommodation was provided for sick monks.\r\n\r\nLastly we come to Bermondsey Abbey, the ancient and once famous\r\nsettlement of Cluniac monks in the ea or eye (island) of a Saxon named\r\nBearmund. Almost all traces of the abbey buildings have disappeared,\r\nthough a good deal existed at the commencement of this century. There\r\nare some fragments of old windows and doorways among the shabby houses\r\nsouth of Grange Walk, and some pieces of the wall in the churchyard of\r\nSt. Mary Magdalene. A considerable portion of the Abbey burial-ground\r\nwas added to this churchyard in 1810. Amongst the benefactors of this\r\nestablishment were William Rufus, Henry I., and King Stephen, and many\r\neminent people were buried in the priory church, while much of great\r\nhistoric interest is connected with the history of Bermondsey Abbey.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe modern representatives of the ancient monasteries and nunneries lack\r\nthe antiquarian flavour which is so attractive to us, and yet there is a\r\ncertain interest attaching to them. But I have only to deal with their\r\nburial-grounds, and therefore need mention very few.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE REMAINS OF BERMONDSEY ABBEY ABOUT 1800.]\r\n\r\nThe third volume of Knight’s “London” commences with the following\r\nwords:—“It is a curious circumstance, and one in which the history of\r\nmany changes of opinion may be read, that within forty years after what\r\nremained of the magnificent ecclesiastical foundation of the Abbey of\r\nBermondsey had been swept away, a new conventual establishment has risen\r\nup, amidst the surrounding desecration of factories and warehouses, in a\r\nlarge and picturesque pile, with its stately church, fitted in every way\r\nfor the residence and accommodation of thirty or forty inmates—the\r\nconvent of the Sisters of Mercy.” The writer of the article refers to\r\nthe convent by the Roman Catholic Chapel in Parker’s Row, built in 1838.\r\nThe chapel, with a small graveyard given in 1833 or 1834, existed\r\npreviously. The garden of the convent was used for burials until August,\r\n1853, but there appear to be no gravestones in it, and it is a\r\nneatly-kept ground between two schools, whereas the graveyard on the\r\neast side of the church is untidy. Another disused burial-ground is\r\nbehind the Roman Catholic Chapel in Commercial Road. Here the tombstones\r\nare laid flat, and the ground forms a garden of considerable size for\r\nthe use of the priests.\r\n\r\nOn the north side of King Street, Hammersmith, just east of the Broadway\r\nStation, is the large red building known as the Convent of the Sacred\r\nHeart, a seminary and establishment erected by the late Cardinal Manning\r\non the site of a Benedictine convent which was founded, according to\r\nsome authorities, before the Reformation, and according to others during\r\nthe reign of Charles II., and which included the Sisterhood of the\r\nEnglish Benedictine Dames and a famous school, where many ladies of\r\ndistinction received their early education. Brewer, in his “Beauties of\r\nLondon and Middlesex” (1816), thus describes the burial-ground of this\r\nconvent: “The gravestones are laid flat on the turf, and the sisters are\r\nplaced, as usual, with their feet to the east; the priests alone having\r\nthe head towards the altar. There are several inscriptions on the\r\nstones, of which we insert the following specimen:—Here lies the body of\r\nThe Right Reverend Lady Mary Anne Clavering, late Abbess of the English\r\nBenedictine Dames of Pontoise, Who died the 8th day of November, 1795,\r\nin the 65th year of her age.” Cardinal Manning disposed of this little\r\ncemetery, which was by the lane on the east side, when erecting the\r\npresent buildings. “It was dug up and done away with,” according to the\r\nstatement of one of the sisters at present in the convent.\r\n\r\nBut two similar burial-grounds are still to be found in this immediate\r\nneighbourhood, one is disused and the other is in use. The former is\r\nbehind the Convent of the Good Shepherd in Fulham Palace Road, only\r\nabout 14 by 12 yards in size, and closed a few years ago. The latter is\r\nat the extreme end of the garden of Nazareth Home in Hammersmith Road,\r\nunder the wall of Great Church Lane. It is even smaller than the one in\r\nFulham Palace Road, and has been in use for upwards of forty years, but\r\nas only the sisters are interred here it would appear to be still\r\navailable for about another twenty years. The graves are in neat rows, a\r\nsmall cross is on each, with the name (or the adopted name) of the\r\nsister whose body lies beneath. It forms a little enclosure in the large\r\nspace and garden behind the buildings of the Home, where many children\r\nare taught and many old people live. Another enclosure contains their\r\npoultry, and another a cow. The whole establishment is very interesting,\r\nand not the least interesting part of it is this little cemetery, of the\r\nexistence of which, in all probability, very few of the inhabitants of\r\nthe surrounding streets have any knowledge.\r\n\r\nI have visited one other convent burial-ground, and in each case it is\r\nnecessary to go through the ceremony of being peeped at through a\r\ngrating, and, when admitted, passed along passages and through rooms\r\nwhile the doors are locked behind, and only granted permission to see\r\nwhat I want after some time of waiting and a large amount of\r\nexplanation. I have been since told that I was singularly favoured by\r\nbeing admitted into the Franciscan Convent in Portobello Road, where the\r\nMother Superior herself most kindly took me to see the little cemetery,\r\nexplaining that it was “sanctioned by the Home Secretary,”—of which I\r\nwas well aware. It is a charming little corner of a very pretty garden,\r\na triangular grass plot edged with trees, not above a quarter of an acre\r\nin extent. It was formed in 1862 and first used in 1870, only five\r\nburials taking place in twenty-three years. It is, of course, merely for\r\nthe interment of the nuns who, having given up the world and shut\r\nthemselves into the convent, find their last resting-place within its\r\nprecincts.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n          THE CATHEDRAL, THE ABBEY, THE TEMPLE, AND THE TOWER.\r\n\r\n                 “The Saints are there—the Living Dead,\r\n                    The Mourners glad and strong;\r\n                  The sacred floor their quiet bed,\r\n                  Their beams from every window shed,\r\n                    Their voice in every song.”\r\n                                  KEBLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERE is one burial-ground in London which has received a large share of\r\nattention, and which has really been thought worthy of lengthy and\r\ndetailed notices in histories of the metropolis—I mean St. Paul’s\r\nChurchyard. The words convey a very distinct meaning to us now. They\r\nsuggest Messrs. Hitchcock and Williams, and a number of other firms with\r\nlarge premises, a constant stream of vans, carts, omnibuses, cabs, and\r\nbicycles passing between Ludgate Hill and Cheapside or Cannon Street,\r\nand a neat garden with flower-beds, seats, and pigeons under the shadow\r\nof the great Cathedral—Wren’s “monument”—which is so different from any\r\nother cathedral, and yet so suitable for the centre of the largest city\r\nin the world. Just as St. Paul’s Cathedral was not always as it is now,\r\nso St. Paul’s Churchyard is also vastly changed. Underneath the soil are\r\nthe graves of Britons, Saxons, and Romans; and I have already referred\r\nto these, and have pointed out how far back into obscure history we can\r\ntrace this particular graveyard.\r\n\r\nMany books have been written about St. Paul’s; Dugdale’s is the best old\r\nhistory, and perhaps Dean Milman’s is the best modern one. The stories\r\nof its foundation, of the shrine of St. Erkenwald, the disastrous fire\r\nof 1136, the Boy Bishops, the chained bibles and the commotion they\r\naroused, the difficulties of the Reformation, and finally the other\r\n“Great Fire” of 1666, which led to the rebuilding of the Cathedral, not\r\nagain as a Gothic structure, but somewhat after the style of St. Peter’s\r\nat Rome, have all been told again and again. The crypt of the Cathedral\r\nwas the parish church of St. Faith, and that of St. Gregory stood where\r\nthe clock tower now is, at the west end. The site of St. Gregory’s\r\nChurchyard is within the posts in front of the west door, where Queen\r\nAnne’s statue stands, while the parish of St. Faith had a piece at the\r\neastern end of the Cathedral, and, according to Newcourt, another piece\r\nwas allotted to St. Martin’s, Ludgate Hill. It is to Dugdale that we are\r\nchiefly indebted for a knowledge of what old St. Paul’s, with its\r\nwindows and monuments, was like—and a splendid church it must have been.\r\nHe was an eminent antiquary who, thinking that the chief ecclesiastical\r\nbuildings in England would suffer from the Civil War, made a most noble\r\npilgrimage, and drew the monuments, copied the epitaphs, and took notes\r\nof the arms in windows, on walls, &c., in St. Paul’s and Westminster\r\nAbbey first, and subsequently in Ely, Norwich, Peterborough, Lincoln,\r\nand a number of other cathedral, conventual, and parish Churches. The\r\nwork he did at St. Paul’s was of exceptional value, owing to the ravages\r\nof the Great Fire.\r\n\r\nThe Cathedral has been surrounded by such interesting buildings as a\r\nBishop’s Palace, the Chapter House and Library, a Bell Tower, several\r\nChantries, a Charnel House, and St. Paul’s School, founded by Dean\r\nColet, and which, some years ago, was totally destroyed, reappearing as\r\na meaty-red structure of huge dimensions (where the foundation scholars,\r\nor “fish,” are in a small minority), in the uninteresting district of\r\nEast Hammersmith, which is misnamed West Kensington.\r\n\r\nSt. Paul’s Churchyard extended, especially on its northern side, farther\r\nthan it does now. Part of it was known as Pardon Church Yard, or\r\n“Haugh,” in which was a chapel founded by Gilbert Becket, rebuilt by\r\nDean Moore in Henry V.’s time, and surrounded by a rich cloister with\r\npictures of “The Dance of Death” painted by Machabre in it, somewhat\r\nlike the ones still existing on the bridge at Lucerne, and with very\r\nfine monuments to those buried beneath. In 1549 the cloister, the\r\nchapel, the charnel house, the paintings, and the tombs were all cleared\r\naway by the Protector Somerset, the materials being used for his new\r\nmansion in the Strand, and the bones from the charnel house (Stow says\r\none thousand cartloads) were reinterred in Finsbury Field. The\r\nchurchyard seems to have been first entirely enclosed by a surrounding\r\nwall in 1285.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAUL’S CROSS and Preaching there\r\n\r\n_Paul’s Cross or preaching place, was erected in the form it appears in\r\nthe plate, about the year 1449, by Thomas Kempe, then Bishop of London,\r\non the site of a more antient cross, which had been destroyed by an\r\nearthquake in 1382. Its name first occurs in the year 1259, when Hen.\r\nIII commanded the Mayor of London to oblige all the city youth of a\r\ncertain age to take the oath of allegiance at Paul’s Cross, to him and\r\nhis heirs. From this period it was, for several centuries, used for\r\nalmost every purpose political as well as ecclesiastical, and is\r\ncontinually noticed in history. It was destroyed by the Lord mayor of\r\nLondon, Isaac Pennington, in consequence of a vote of Parliament, in the\r\nyear 1643._\r\n\r\nPAUL’S CROSS.]\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the most interesting object in the churchyard was Paul’s\r\nCross, which existed as far back as the reign of Henry III., if not\r\nearlier. From that time until 1643, when it was ruthlessly destroyed by\r\norder of Parliament, it formed a notable monument, round which the\r\nreligious history of London and of England centred itself. Paul’s Cross\r\nwas an outdoor pulpit at the north-east corner of the Cathedral—“a\r\npulpit cross of timber, mounted upon steps of stone covered with lead,”\r\nfrom which “announcements and harangues on all such matters as the\r\nauthorities in Church or State judged to be of public concern were\r\npoured into the popular ear and heart.” It seems to have been used to\r\npreach sermons from as early as 1299, and men professing all shades of\r\nthe Christian faith have discoursed there, miscreants have done penance\r\nthere, bishops and clergy have renounced heresies, excited throngs have\r\ngathered round excited preachers, and tricks and delusions, called\r\nmiracles, have been exposed there. Latimer and Ridley frequently\r\noccupied the pulpit, and “proclaimed to crowds of eager listeners that\r\ntestimony which they both afterwards sealed with their blood.” During\r\nthe time of the reforming struggles of our Church the pulpit at Paul’s\r\nCross played an active part, and those who preached there in the reign\r\nof Mary had to be protected from the populace by the Queen’s guard. In\r\n1628 James I. came in state to hear a sermon from Bishop King, and\r\nCharles I. listened to another discourse from Paul’s Cross in 1630. It\r\nis said that after its demolition an elm-tree marked its site, but even\r\nthis has long since disappeared.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELM ON SITE OF PAUL’S CROSS.]\r\n\r\nYet the Churchyard was not only a religious centre, but was also a very\r\nworldly one. Many unseemly scenes used to take place there, and the\r\nground was walled in because it was becoming the resort of those who did\r\nnot behave themselves properly. The following account from Maitland\r\ngives us a sad, if a lively, picture of the times: “In the year 1569 a\r\nLottery was set on Foot in St. Paul’s Churchyard, where it was begun to\r\nbe drawn at the West Door of the Church on the 11th of January, and\r\ncontinued incessantly drawing Day and Night till the 6th of May\r\nfollowing.” The Cathedral itself was put to a variety of unsuitable\r\nuses, and was made a judgment-hall for foreign heretics who were\r\ncondemned to be burnt at Smithfield. The author of a tract written in\r\nthe second half of the sixteenth century describes the south aisle as\r\nbeing used “for usury and popery, the north for simony, and the\r\nhorse-fair in the midst for all kinds of bargains, meetings, brawlings,\r\nmurthers, conspiracies; and the font for ordinary payments of money.”\r\nTraffic in benefices was largely carried on there, and the middle aisle\r\n(Paul’s Walk) was a rendezvous, every morning and afternoon, for a\r\nfashionable and eccentric medley. Thus was the chief temple in London\r\ntreated as vilely as the Temple at Jerusalem, and there are those now\r\nliving amongst us who wish to see our English churches used for secular\r\npurposes!\r\n\r\nWith one mighty blow the whole building was destroyed, and the beautiful\r\nGothic Cathedral became a heap of cinders. It is told in “Parentalia”\r\nhow, under the direction of Wren, the new St. Paul’s arose like a phœnix\r\nfrom the ashes of the old church. From an interesting print of 1701 it\r\nappears that the churchyard was even then a fashionable promenade, but\r\nit is improbable that the building itself, in its new form, was ever\r\nsubjected to such abuses as the old one had been. I have heard Wren’s\r\nchurches described as “religious rather than Christian,” but as time\r\ngoes on the architecture seems to be more appreciated. Wordsworth has\r\nsaid:—\r\n\r\n                  “They dreamt not of a perishable home\r\n                   Who thus could build,”\r\n\r\n\r\nbut he has also told us that the Cathedral is—\r\n\r\n              “Filled with mementoes, satiate with its past\r\n               Of grateful England’s overflowing Dead”—\r\n\r\nand herein lies its chief interest.\r\n\r\nNo one has done his duty by St. Paul’s who has not been in the crypt.\r\nDr. Donne’s monument, which dates from before the fire, has been brought\r\nup and placed in the south aisle of the choir, amongst those of bishops\r\nand deans, but some fragments of other tombs from old St. Paul’s are\r\nstill in the crypt, besides many tablets and monuments of later date.\r\nThere was for many years a prejudice against admitting memorial\r\nmonuments in the Cathedral at all, but one being erected to the memory\r\nof John Howard, the reformer, the spell was broken. Several old stones\r\non the floor of the crypt have no graves below them, those they\r\ncommemorate having been buried outside in the churchyard, but now the\r\nfew internments that take place are under the floor of the building, Sir\r\nFrederic (Lord) Leighton’s being the newest grave. Here also lie Sir\r\nNicholas Bacon, Sir Thomas Lawrence, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Sir\r\nChristopher Wren, Dean Colet, George Cruikshank, Opie, West, Turner,\r\nLord Napier of Magdala, Lord Mayor Nottage (who died in office in 1885),\r\nBishop Piers Claughton, and many other notable persons. There is one\r\ndivision where there are gravestones in memory of past vergers of the\r\nCathedral. Directly under the dome are the remains of Nelson, in a\r\ncoffin made from wood of the _Victory_, enclosed in a sarcophagus\r\noriginally intended for Cardinal Wolsey, but put aside as he was not\r\nconsidered worthy of it, and subsequently brought out and altered to\r\nsuit Lord Nelson. Close by is a larger sarcophagus containing the\r\nremains of the Duke of Wellington.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. MARGARET’S AND THE ABBEY CHURCHYARD ABOUT 1750.]\r\n\r\nThe Churchyard is no longer a fashionable resort, but it has been a very\r\nuseful one since 1879, and many are the visitors who may always be found\r\nsitting there, while the pigeons fly amongst the tall and smoky columns.\r\nThe Rev. H. R. Haweis says the Cathedral should be washed. He is right,\r\nno doubt, but “stately Paule” still remains black.\r\n\r\nNeither the graveyard of the Knights Templars, the great rivals of the\r\nKnights Hospitallers at Clerkenwell, nor the garth of the Abbey of St.\r\nPeter, have had a record so varied as that which clings round St. Paul’s\r\nChurchyard. The Temple Church, especially the round portion of it, is\r\nmost ancient and interesting, but it has been much injured by the modern\r\nrepresentatives of the Templars who have denuded the walls of many rich\r\nold monuments. The part of the churchyard which is immediately round the\r\nchurch is closed and turfed and has some fine old stone coffins in it.\r\nThe northern part is paved and gravelled and is added to the public\r\nthoroughfare, the chief object in it of general interest being the grave\r\nand monument of Oliver Goldsmith.\r\n\r\nWe go on, along the Strand, past Charing Cross, until we reach the\r\n“minster in the west,” or the Collegiate Church of St. Peter, which was\r\nbuilt in the Island of Thorney. It is probable that the whole space now\r\noccupied by the Abbey and St. Margaret’s and their churchyards was at\r\none time used for interments. At present the Abbey Churchyard and that\r\nof St. Margaret’s (where at times a fair used to be held) are in one.\r\nThey are neatly turfed and open to the public, and they form a simple\r\nbut suitable base for the glorious old buildings which rise from them.\r\nOn the south side of the Abbey are the large and small cloisters, with\r\ntheir grass plots and their ancient stones, while, according to Brayley,\r\na part of Covent Garden Market is on the site of what used to be the\r\nburial-ground of the Westminster Convent. Portions of the cloisters are\r\namong the most ancient and interesting corners of the Abbey buildings,\r\nand the sight of them carries us back in thought to the days of the\r\nabbots and monks, who used to pace to and fro under the vaulted roof.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, the burial-places outside the Abbey, but the church\r\nitself, round which the most thrilling associations gather. Here again\r\nthe story has been often repeated, and if there are any of my readers\r\n(though I doubt if there can be one) who do not know what venerable\r\ntombs are contained there, they would do well to visit the Abbey, and\r\nnot to rest until they have been carefully shown the treasures in Henry\r\nVII.’s Chapel. Beaumont sang—\r\n\r\n                 “Think how many royal bones\r\n                  Sleep within these heaps of stones....\r\n                  Here’s an acre sown indeed\r\n                  With the richest, royallist seed.”\r\n\r\nFrom the shrine of Edward the Confessor and the tomb of Edward III. to\r\nthe tablet in memory of Charles Dickens and the stone over the grave of\r\nCharles Darwin, they are one and all of the deepest interest, and it is\r\nperfectly needless for me to refer to the monuments here. Every\r\nEnglishman is—or should be—proud of these relics, of the beautiful\r\nChapel, the Poets’ Corner, and the hallowed nave and aisles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREAT CLOISTER, WESTMINSTER.]\r\n\r\nIt is true that there are too many monuments in Westminster Abbey; a\r\nmemorial chapel in which some of them (especially the huge statues from\r\nthe north transept) could be put, would be very advantageous. But, at\r\nany rate, they are not likely now to be much further added to, and from\r\nthe old, royal tombs, there is not one fragment of mosaic or one\r\nsplinter of stone which we should not grieve to lose. Sir Godfrey\r\nKneller, the painter and the friend of Pope, did not wish to be interred\r\nin the Abbey because “they do bury fools there.” But his monument is not\r\nmissed amongst the tombs of England’s greatest children, her kings and\r\nqueens, her bishops and deans, her statesmen, her soldiers, her poets,\r\nher artists, and her philosophers. The whole building is one grand\r\nmemorial. There may be “fools there,” but they sink into utter\r\ninsignificance, for “saints are there, the living dead.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n_The South East Prospect of the Chapel Royal of St. Peter in the Tower._\r\nST. PETER’S CHAPEL IN THE TOWER ABOUT 1750.]\r\n\r\nTo pass from the Abbey to the Tower is like passing from honour to\r\nshame, and yet amongst those who were imprisoned, executed, and buried\r\nin the great fortress and palace which became the state prison of\r\nEngland, many were innocent of the crimes for which they were punished,\r\nand many deserved to rest in Westminster even more than some of those\r\nwho were interred there. There were four recognised burial-places\r\nconnected with the Tower, the churchyard of St. Peter ad Vincula, the\r\nvaults under the church, the vaults “behind the church,” and the outer\r\ngraveyard. The last named was a narrow strip by the eastern wall,\r\nprobably used for the burial of the humbler members of the numerous\r\nhouseholds which composed the Tower precinct. This ground was demolished\r\nwhen the Tower Bridge was made, being required for the wide approach\r\nthereto. It is also probable that burials took place in a somewhat\r\npromiscuous fashion in other parts of the fortress. We know, for\r\ninstance, that the young Princes, after they had been smothered, were\r\nburied at the foot of the staircase of the White Tower, “meetly deep in\r\nthe ground, under a great heap of stones,” from whence their remains, or\r\nwhat was supposed to be their remains, were moved to Westminster Abbey\r\nin 1674 by Order of King Charles II.\r\n\r\nIn St. Peter’s Church were buried the headless bodies of many a noble\r\nprisoner who was executed close by, with the remains of others who died\r\nduring their confinement in the Tower—the Earl of Arundel, the Dukes of\r\nSomerset, Monmouth, Norfolk, and Northumberland, Queen Katherine, poor\r\ninnocent Anne Boleyn, her brother, Lord Rochford, the Countess of\r\nSalisbury, Catherine Howard, and a great many more whose names are\r\nrecorded in English history. The chapel is not as beautiful as it might\r\nbe, and the graveyard attached to it is little more than a part of the\r\ngreat Tower courtyard, but the sad memories connected with it will\r\nalways hallow this spot. In the quaint little church of Holy Trinity,\r\nMinories, supposed by some to be a survival of the Abbey of the\r\nMinoresses of St. Clare, there is still shown what is said to be the\r\nhead of the Duke of Suffolk, the father of Lady Jane Grey. It is in a\r\nglass case, preserved like leather, some hair still clings to the scalp,\r\nwhile the false blow of the executioner can be clearly seen just above\r\nthe place where the head was severed from the trunk. The verger keeps\r\nthis marvellous relic locked up in a pew; it is a sort of detached\r\nfragment of the history of the Tower.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THREE COFFIN LIDS FROM THE TOWER.]\r\n\r\nI feel that I have done but very scant justice to those London\r\nburial-places which contain the ashes of the most illustrious dead. But\r\nI have no wish to go over ground already trodden by far worthier\r\nchroniclers than myself, and I therefore commend to all who desire to\r\nknow more about the Cathedral, the Abbey, the Temple, and the Tower, the\r\nmany excellent books which have been written upon their history, such as\r\nDean Milman’s “Annals of St. Paul’s Cathedral,” Dean Stanley’s\r\n“Memorials of Westminster Abbey,” and a number of more ancient and more\r\nmodern works which especially relate to these buildings and to the\r\nmonuments they contain. The Kyrle Society has recently published a\r\ncapital little guide to the Cathedral, which can be bought with the\r\ntickets to view the crypt, the whispering gallery, &c., and which also\r\nserves as a handbook to the monuments in the nave and aisles.\r\n\r\n                “Death lays his icy hands on kings:\r\n                     Sceptre and crown\r\n                     Must tumble down,\r\n                 And in the dust be equal made\r\n                 With the poor crooked scythe and spade.\r\n\r\n                     All heads must come\r\n                     To the cold tomb,\r\n                 Only the actions of the just\r\n                 Smell sweet and blossom in the dust.”\r\n                                J. SHIRLEY.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                         THE CITY CHURCHYARDS.\r\n\r\n         “Such strange churchyards hide in the City of London.”\r\n                                        DICKENS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI HAVE already referred, in Chapter I., to the different areas occupied\r\nby the City of London at different periods. But the City, as we know it\r\nnow, averages, roughly speaking, a mile and a half from east to west and\r\nthree-quarters of a mile from north to south. It includes a considerable\r\nspace outside the old wall, and the boundary line is very irregular,\r\nexcept on the southern side, where is the “silent highway.” It is\r\ngoverned by the Corporation, and its ancient wards are represented by\r\nAldermen, while the Lord Mayor commences his year of office by a public\r\nprocession through the streets on November 9th, supported by his\r\ndignified companions, the Sheriffs.\r\n\r\nThe City of London is the Office of the World. Its highways represent\r\nuntold wealth, and its byways reek with poverty and dirt; it contains\r\nthe most bustling thoroughfares and the most retired corners; it is full\r\nof business and affairs up to date, and yet teeming with antiquarian\r\ninterest, and relics of ancient history. As on one side of a busy road\r\nwe have Cannon Street Station and on the other side the venerable\r\n“London Stone,” so the City churches, with their old-world churchyards,\r\nare wedged in between huge modern warehouses, offices, and public\r\nbuildings; “churchyards sometimes so entirely detached from churches,\r\nalways so pressed upon by houses; so small, so rank, so silent, so\r\nforgotten—except for the few people who ever look down into them from\r\ntheir smoky windows. As I stand peeping in through the iron gates and\r\nrails I can peel the rusty metal off, like bark from an old tree. The\r\nillegible tombstones are all lopsided, the grave-mounds lost their shape\r\nin the rains of a hundred years ago, the Lombardy Poplar or Plane-tree\r\nthat was once a drysalter’s daughter and several common-councilmen, has\r\nwithered like those worthies, and its departed leaves are dust beneath\r\nit.... Sometimes, the queer hall of some queer Company gives upon a\r\nchurchyard such as this, and, when the Livery dine, you may hear them\r\n(if you are looking in through the iron rails, which you never are when\r\nI am) toasting their own Worshipful prosperity.... Sometimes, the\r\ncommanding windows are all blank, and show no more sign of life than the\r\ngraves below—not so much, for _they_ tell of what once upon a time was\r\nlife undoubtedly.”\r\n\r\nPoor little churchyards, they are so insignificant, and many of them are\r\neven more shrunken than when Charles Dickens visited them. Thus we hear\r\nof an injunction being sought for to restrain the would-be reformer from\r\ncutting off a two-foot-wide strip of St. Martin Orgar’s ground to make a\r\ndry area behind the houses in Crooked Lane; and the Commissioners of\r\nSewers possess the right, and sometimes use it, of curtailing a\r\nchurchyard in order to widen a road. In 1884, for instance, they gave\r\n£750 for a piece at the eastern end of Allhallows’ Churchyard, London\r\nWall. The remainder of that little ground is now a public garden, laid\r\nout in 1894 by the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association, and is a\r\nquiet resting-place in the busy thoroughfare, with a piece of the\r\nancient City wall still existing in it. Most of the churchyards\r\n“entirely detached from churches” are the sites of the burned buildings,\r\nwhich were used as burial-grounds for the amalgamated parishes—for the\r\nmournful calamity of 1666 visited the churches of London with “peculiar\r\nseverity,” 89 of them being destroyed, 51 of which were rebuilt by Wren\r\nand his followers, and 35 of which were not replaced. All the City\r\nchurchyards are now protected from being built upon by the Disused\r\nBurial-grounds Act of 1888, but that Act has not yet been read to\r\ninclude the sites of the churches themselves which are from time to time\r\nremoved, and which have all had interments in the vaults underneath\r\nthem. The site of Allhallows’ the Great, Upper Thames Street, was\r\nrecently sold to a brewery company, but has not yet been built upon,\r\nbecause it is thought that an injunction will be served upon the builder\r\nand that it will be made a test case.\r\n\r\nOf the burial-grounds attached to the Cathedral, the Temple, and the\r\nchurches which are the survivals of the priories, I have already\r\nwritten; apart from these one of the oldest of the churches founded in\r\nthe City is sometimes supposed to be that of St. Mary Woolnoth, Lombard\r\nStreet. The present building, which is threatened by a railway company,\r\nis by Hawksmoor, but a church existed on the site in very early days. In\r\nSt. Peter’s, Cornhill, is a tablet, the authenticity of which is\r\ncertainly open to grave doubt, recording the fact that a church was\r\nerected on this spot by Lucius in A.D. 179, but the genuine history of\r\nthe foundation can only be traced as far back as 1230. The burial-ground\r\nof St. Benet Sherehog, in Pancras Lane, marks the site of a church\r\ndating from Saxon times, dedicated to St. Osyth,—Size Lane, which is\r\nclose by, being a survival of the name. The City churches still\r\nstanding, of which the whole or a part date from before the Great Fire,\r\nare St. Bartholomew’s the Great; Allhallows’, Barking; the Temple; St.\r\nHelen’s, Bishopsgate Street; and St. Catherine Cree, Leadenhall Street,\r\nall connected with priories; and St. Bartholomew’s the Less; St. Giles’,\r\nCripplegate; St. Olave’s, Hart Street; St. Ethelburga’s, Bishopsgate\r\nStreet; St. Andrew’s Undershaft, Leadenhall Street; and Allhallows’,\r\nStaining, Star Alley.\r\n\r\nThe church of St. Bartholomew the Less, of which but a very small\r\nportion of the tower is ancient, is within the Hospital enclosure, and\r\nthe churchyard is smaller than it was, some of it having been thrown\r\ninto the paved courtyard. St. Ethelburga’s churchyard is a quaint little\r\ncourtyard with a few tombstones in it, only approached through the\r\nchurch and vestry. In St Andrew’s Undershaft (or “under the maypole,”\r\nwhich used to be suspended on the houses in St. Mary Axe) the monument\r\nof John Stow is to be found—poor Stow, whose survey of London is the\r\nfoundation for all modern histories. The adjoining churchyard is very\r\nsmall. That of Allhallows’, Barking, has lately been entirely covered\r\nwith building materials, owing to the restoration of the church. It was,\r\naccording to Stow, “sometime far larger.”\r\n\r\nThe churchyard of St. Olave’s, Hart Street (Dickens’ St. Ghastly Grim),\r\nis an interesting one. The church itself is one of the most beautiful\r\npieces of ecclesiastical architecture in London—a small Gothic building,\r\nadmirable in its proportion. The old gate of the churchyard has skulls\r\nand cross bones on it, and in this ground were interred a vast number of\r\nthe victims of the plague of 1665, which is said to have taken its\r\norigin in this parish in the Drapers’ Almshouses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALLHALLOWS’, STAINING, 1838.]\r\n\r\nOf the church of Allhallows’, Staining, only the tower remains, in the\r\ncentre of a neatly-kept little burial-ground. This was the model for the\r\nchurchtower in “Old London” at the exhibition at South Kensington in\r\n1886.[1] The churchyard of St. Giles’, Cripplegate, the church which\r\ncontains the monument to Milton, has a long and varied history. It is\r\nwell known to antiquarians, as the valuable relic, the postern of the\r\nCity wall, is situated in it. The story of this ground is one of\r\nadditions and encroachments, and it has found a careful chronicler in\r\nMr. Baddeley, a former churchwarden. The addition running south was\r\ncalled the “Green Churchyard,” a name which we find repeated in other\r\nparishes—for instance, it was given to the higher portion of the\r\nchurchyard of St. James’, Piccadilly, and to the little piece by St.\r\nBartholomew the Great, approached through the present south transept.\r\nThe gravestones at St. Giles’ have been laid flat, and the ground is\r\nneatly kept and generally open, but not provided with seats for the\r\npublic. Until Michaelmas, 1640, “the military” used to be trained in\r\nthis churchyard.[2]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  In 1873 a crypt was made under the tower, in which were deposited the\r\n  remains from Lambe’s Chapel, St. James’s in the Wall, Monkswell\r\n  Street.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  Malcolm’s “Londinium Redivivum.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CRIPPLEGATE CHURCHYARD ABOUT 1830.]\r\n\r\nThere were four churches in the City dedicated to St. Botolph, a pious\r\nSaxon who built a monastery, in 654, in Lincolnshire. It is a little\r\ncurious that all the four churchyards are now public gardens—St.\r\nBotolph’s, Bishopsgate; St. Botolph’s, Aldgate; St. Botolph’s,\r\nAldersgate; and St. Botolph’s, Billingsgate, The last-named church was\r\nnot rebuilt after the Fire, and the site of one of its churchyards, the\r\n“lower ground,” is now occupied by a new warehouse with red heads on the\r\nfrontage, on the south side of Lower Thames Street. What remains of the\r\n“upper ground” is a small, three-cornered, asphalted court, open to the\r\npublic, with seats, a drinking fountain, and a coffee stall. The\r\ncharming little garden in Aldersgate Street includes three churchyards,\r\nthat of St. Botolph, an additional one for St. Leonard’s, Foster Lane,\r\nand an additional one for Christ Church, Newgate Street, which is at the\r\nwestern end, and was given to the parish in 1825 by the Governors of\r\nChrist’s Hospital when the Great Hall was built and a small\r\nburial-ground at the north-west corner of the buildings could no longer\r\nbe used. The Metropolitan Public Gardens Association laid out Aldgate\r\nchurchyard in 1892; it is much appreciated, and is maintained by an\r\nannual grant from the charity funds of the parish. A melancholy incident\r\ntook place here in September, 1838, when two men, a gravedigger and a\r\nfish-dealer, lost their lives in a grave by being poisoned with the foul\r\nair. The grave was a “common one,” such as was often kept open for two\r\nmonths until filled with seventeen or eighteen bodies. It may safely be\r\nsaid that all the City burial-grounds were crowded to excess. Their\r\nlimited area would invite such treatment, and it was only natural that\r\nthe City parishioner should choose to be interred in the parish\r\nchurchyard, unless the still greater privilege were afforded him of\r\nbeing buried in the vaults under the church. The other churchyards in\r\nthe City which have been laid out for public recreation are those of St.\r\nPaul’s Cathedral; St. Olave, Silver Street; Allhallows, London Wall; St.\r\nKatherine Coleman, Fenchurch Street; St. Mary, Aldermanbury; St.\r\nSepulchre, Holborn; and St. Bride, Fleet Street; while the churchyard of\r\nSt. Dunstan in the West, situated in Fetter Lane, is the playground of\r\nthe Greystoke Place Board School; and that of St. James, Duke Street, is\r\nthe playground of the Aldgate Ward Schools.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. MILDRED’S, BREAD STREET, ABOUT 1825.]\r\n\r\nMost of the remaining City churchyards are quiet little spaces,\r\nsurrounded by huge warehouses. Many are only approached through the\r\nchurches, and are invisible from the road. St. Mildred’s, in Bread\r\nStreet, is unfortunately used as a store-yard for ladders of all sizes,\r\nand it seems, from the accompanying illustration, to have been turned to\r\naccount many years ago, while the very small piece that remains by the\r\ntower of St. Mary Somerset, Thames Street, where the Weavers of Brabant\r\nused to hold their meetings, is full of old iron, &c. One or two are\r\nprivate gardens, such as St. Michael’s Churchyard, Queenhithe. Others\r\nhave been paved and added to the public footway, such as that of St.\r\nMary Abchurch, their extent being still visible. This is the Case with\r\nthe churchyard of St. Michael Bassishaw, in Basinghall Street. The\r\nground is now part of the pavement, but the two large trees which grew\r\nin it are still flourishing. On the site of the churchyard of St. Benet\r\nFink, in Threadneedle Street, is Peabody’s statue. The untidy little\r\nyard in Farringdon Street, which is used as a volunteer drill-ground,\r\nwas once an additional burying-place for St. Bride’s, Fleet Street. It\r\nwas given to the parish in 1610 by the Earl of Dorset, on condition that\r\nno more burials should take place in the southern part of the churchyard\r\nwhich was opposite his house. The house was destroyed by the Great Fire\r\nand the churchyard used again. The graveyard of St. Christopher le\r\nStocks is the garden of the Bank of England, and Timbs states, although\r\nhe does not vouch for the authenticity of the story, that the mould for\r\nthe burial-ground of Whitfield’s Tabernacle in Tottenham Court Road was\r\nbrought from this churchyard, “by which the consecration fees were\r\nsaved.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GROUND PLAN OF ST. BENET FINK IN 1834.]\r\n\r\nOf the City churchyards which have been completely annihilated, apart\r\nfrom other kinds of burial-grounds within this area, there must have\r\nbeen at least forty. And this destruction has been due to the\r\ndissolution of the priories, the formation of new streets, and the\r\ninvasion of the railways. Norden mentions three churches in Farringdon\r\nWard Within which have gone—St. Nicholas in the Fleshshambles (which was\r\nin Newgate Street), St. Ewans (south of Newgate Street), and St. Genyn\r\nwithin St. Martin le Grand. When Queen Victoria Street was made the\r\nchurchyards of St. Mary Mounthaw, St. Nicholas Olave, and St. Mary\r\nMagdalen, Knightrider Street, disappeared; that of St. Michael, Crooked\r\nLane, a plot of land given by one Robert Marsh and consecrated in 1392,\r\nwas sacrificed for King William Street; and that of St. Benet, Paul’s\r\nWharf (now the Welsh Church), where Inigo Jones was buried, for St.\r\nBenet’s Hill. A complete list of them will be found in the Appendix.\r\nCannon Street Station of the South Eastern Railway covers the churchyard\r\nof St. Mary Bothaw; and for Cannon Street Station of the District\r\nRailway that of St. John’s, Cloak Lane, was destroyed, the human remains\r\nbeing “dug up, sifted, put in chests with charcoal, nailed down, put one\r\non the top of the other in a brick vault and sealed up for ever, or\r\nrather till some others in time come to turn them out again.” Part of\r\nthe General Post Office is on the churchyard of St. Leonard, Foster\r\nLane; the Mercer’s Hall is on that of St. Thomas Acons, where the\r\npilgrims were buried; the Mansion House Station is on that of Holy\r\nTrinity the Less; and the Mansion House itself is on that of St. Mary\r\nWoolchurch Haw, in which a balance used to stand “for the weighing of\r\nwool.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHURCHYARD OF ST. BENET, PAUL’S WHARF, 1838.]\r\n\r\nMost of the existing churchyards have but few tombstones left in them,\r\nseveral have none at all. But some of them can still boast of fine\r\ntrees, which add much to the interest and picturesque appearance of the\r\nCity streets, and I hope it may be a long time before those in\r\nStationers’ Hall Court, under which there were vaults belonging to St.\r\nMartin’s, Ludgate, and in the churchyards of St. Peter Cheap, Wood\r\nStreet, and St. Dunstan in the East, cease to grow and flourish.\r\n\r\nWe want to see all of these little churchyards opened to the public and\r\nprovided with seats. The Metropolitan Public Gardens Association is\r\nalways ready to put them in order, but it is difficult to secure their\r\nmaintenance. The parish funds which might be available for such a\r\npurpose have been so cut down and diverted by the Charity Commissioners\r\nthat it is, in many cases, impossible for any provision to be made for\r\nthe upkeep of the churchyard, small though the cost may be. But I trust\r\nthat this difficulty may be, before long, removed, and then we may\r\nexpect a great improvement in the condition of the City churchyards\r\nwhich have all been closed for burials for upwards of forty years, and\r\nwhich are so singularly well suited for conversion into “outdoor\r\nsitting-rooms” for those who can take a few moments of rest from their\r\nwork in the surrounding offices and warehouses. And they are worthy of\r\nthe utmost respect, for they contain the ashes of some of the noblest\r\ncitizens of London, some of its greatest benefactors and its hardest\r\nworkers, those who have helped, stone by stone, to raise the great city\r\nto the height to which it has attained in its influence in the world.\r\n\r\nIn 1668 the Lord Mayor “issued out a Precept, commanding, amongst other\r\nwholesome orders ... that the Inhabitants, Householders, and others\r\nconcerned, should not throw or suffer any Ashes, Dirt, or other Filth,\r\nto be cast out ... before any Church or Churchyard ... upon pain of 20\r\nshillings.” But in 1896 we need visit very few of these same churchyards\r\nbefore we come to one in which rubbish of all kinds is allowed to\r\naccumulate and to remain. Yet they are sacred spots, consecrated\r\necclesiastically and historically, and instead of being permitted to\r\nsink into the oblivion of insignificance they should all be made\r\nbeautiful in memory of the dead and for the benefit of the living, for\r\nin them are “the tombs of the wealthy and the humble heaps of the poor.”\r\nThe Old Society for the Protection of City Churches and Churchyards did\r\nsomething towards their preservation, and lately a new City Church\r\nPreservation Society has been formed, the Chairman of Council being Mr.\r\nH. C. Richards, M.P., and the Hon. Secretary the Rev. Rowland B. Hill.\r\nIt has already displayed most praiseworthy activity, and is, at the\r\npresent time, endeavouring to save the church of St. Mary Woolnoth, in\r\nLombard Street (built by Hawksmoor) from being demolished for a railway\r\nstation. There is a very small churchyard attached to this church.\r\n\r\nAnd it may be interesting here to give particulars of a case in which\r\nthe decision arrived at is valuable to those who are fighting the battle\r\nof protection. In the Session of 1881 the London School Board, through\r\nthe Education Department, introduced a Bill, called the Elementary\r\nEducation Provisional Order Confirmation Bill, for the purpose of\r\nacquiring compulsory powers over the burial-ground in Bream’s Buildings,\r\nFetter Lane, belonging to the church of St. Dunstan in the West, and\r\nwhich adjoins the Greystoke Place Board School. The rector and\r\nchurchwardens, supported by the vestry of the parish, entered an\r\nopposition to the Bill, and appeared against it before the Committee of\r\nthe House of Lords. Their opposition was entirely successful (and it\r\nmust be remembered that the Disused Burial Grounds Act had not then been\r\npassed), and the London School Board was merely given a right of way to\r\nthe school through the graveyard. The costs of the opposition amounted\r\nto £236 12s. 10d., which was charged upon the poor rate. The auditor\r\ndisallowed the charge, but on appeal to the Local Government Board it\r\nwas sanctioned.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                 LONDON CHURCHYARDS, OUTSIDE THE CITY.\r\n\r\n                   “I will lay me in the village ground,\r\n                There are the dead respected.”\r\n                               H. K. WHITE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERE are few spots in England more peaceful, more suggestive, and more\r\nhallowed than our village churchyards, when they are treated with that\r\nreverence which is their due. I have many in my mind now, but I will try\r\nto think of one only “where the churchyard, grey with stone and green\r\nwith turf, holds its century of dead,” where “side by side, the poor man\r\nand the son of pride, lie calm and still.” The church is grey and\r\nivy-grown. Its broad tower, that has weathered many a storm, is half\r\nhidden amongst tall trees bursting into leaf, which hold, high up in\r\ntheir branches, the nests of the cawing rooks. Far below winds the\r\ngentle river, between wide stretches of meadow-land, and there is the\r\nold one-span bridge with the picturesque cottages of the village\r\nfollowing each other down to it and up again, and in the background of\r\nthe picture are the sheltering, sheep-covered hills. An old gabled\r\nparsonage adjoins the church, and the pathway which leads to it is\r\nthrough the peaceful sleeping-place of those whose tired bodies have\r\nbeen laid upon “the pillow of the restful earth.” The birds are making\r\nmusic in the trees, the gentlest of vernal breezes stirs the air, and\r\nfrom the seat in the venerable porch I can look out upon that quiet\r\nscene in the “lengthening April day.” Green grass, long and sweet, is\r\ngrowing amongst the “grey tombstones with their half-worn epitaphs,” and\r\nis trying to hide the primroses and the early bluebell buds which are\r\npeeping from the ground, for there\r\n\r\n                          “the flowers of earth\r\n                  Their very best make speed to wear,\r\n                And e’en the funeral mound gives birth\r\n                  To wild thyme fresh and violets fair.”\r\n\r\nIt is so green and fresh, so calm and sweet a spot in which to await the\r\nresurrection morn, that we can understand what Keble felt when he said,\r\n\r\n                 “Stoop, little child, nor fear to kiss\r\n                  The green buds on this bed of death.”\r\n\r\nAs there is “no fear in love,” so there should be no “fear” in death,\r\nfor death is but our translation into the presence of the greater love\r\n“which passeth knowledge.”\r\n\r\nOur London churchyards of to-day were once village churchyards, and were\r\nattached to quiet old churches which, with a few neighbouring houses,\r\nstood far away from the town and were encircled with fields. There are\r\nmany now living who can remember walking from the City to St. Mary’s,\r\nIslington, by a footpath through the meadows, and such was also at one\r\ntime the case with Paddington, St. Pancras, Hackney, Shoreditch,\r\nStepney, Bow, Bromley, Rotherhithe, Lewisham, Camberwell, Wandsworth,\r\nBattersea, and many other parishes. It is difficult to realise it now,\r\nand yet it is only in the present century that they have been merged\r\ninto the great metropolis, and separated by many miles of houses from\r\nthe hedges and fields. Nor is it long since the village stocks were\r\nmoved from several of the churchyard gates.\r\n\r\nMost of the original parish churches have been replaced, some of them\r\nmore than once. The oldest ones now in existence are St. Saviour’s,\r\nSouthwark, Stepney, Bow, Chelsea, Fulham, the Savoy, Westminster (St.\r\nMargaret’s), Lambeth, Deptford (St. Nicholas’), and Putney, with the\r\ntower of old Hackney Church. Many of the others belong to the eighteenth\r\ncentury. In the tenth year of the reign of Queen Anne the number of\r\nhouses in the districts adjacent to the City having increased so\r\nrapidly, it was enacted by Parliament that fifty new churches should be\r\nbuilt “for the better Instruction of all in the Principles of\r\nChristianity,” and for “redressing the inconvenience and growing\r\nmischiefs which resulted from the increase of Dissenters and Popery.” In\r\norder to raise the necessary funds it was agreed to levy an additional\r\nduty of two shillings per chaldron “upon all Coals and Culm” that were\r\nbrought into London, and two shillings per ton upon weighable coals for\r\na term of 137 days, after which for eight years the duty was to be three\r\nshillings per chaldron and per ton. But although some old churches were\r\nrebuilt or repaired at that time, only ten new ones were erected, such\r\nas St. Anne’s, Limehouse, St. George’s in the East, St. Luke’s, Old\r\nStreet, and St. John the Evangelist’s, Westminster.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALL SAINTS, WANDSWORTH, ABOUT 1800.]\r\n\r\nDescriptions of the churchyards attached to these churches are not easy\r\nto find, nor were they of any great interest, except that many notable\r\nmen were buried in them. Yet there is one point in connection with them\r\nthat is interesting, and it is that although the churches are in the\r\nsevere and sometimes almost grotesque style of architecture of Gibb,\r\nHawksmoor, and others, yet in the eighteenth century it was customary to\r\nerect headstones over graves with elaborately carved designs.\r\nEighteenth-century tombstones have hour-glasses, scythes, cherubs’\r\nheads—blowing or smiling or weeping—elaborate scenes, generally\r\nallegorical of the flight of time, and epitaphs upon which much thought\r\nand care were expended. With the nineteenth century the carved\r\ntombstones disappeared.[3] St. Paul’s churchyard,\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  This subject has been carefully gone into by Mr. W. T. Vincent, who\r\n  has quite lately brought out a book upon the designs on carved\r\n  tombstones.\r\n\r\nDeptford, contains many quaint specimens, and here also is a “shelter,”\r\nthe roof of which was the old pulpit sounding-board, But the older\r\nchurchyards, those which may be more rightly described as the merged\r\nvillage churchyards, have been pictured from time to time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY TOMBSTONE.]\r\n\r\nOne of Mr. Loftie’s original ideas is to describe London as known by\r\nStow, Norden, and Shakespeare, who lived and wrote at about the same\r\ntime, _i.e._, 1600. I do not mean to say that he tells us what the\r\nburial-grounds were like in that day, for no historian of London ever\r\nseemed to think it worth while to do more than refer to one here and one\r\nthere, or I should not have ventured to put forward this work at a time\r\nwhen we are satiated with histories of the metropolis; but I will, for a\r\nmoment, adopt his plan. It is impossible to read _Hamlet_ and the vivid\r\ndescription of the gravediggers who played at “loggats” with the skulls\r\nand bones, while they drank and sung, without coming to the conclusion\r\nthat Shakespeare had witnessed the very same practices in the graveyards\r\nin his day as were exposed and stopped no less than two and a half\r\ncenturies later, when “skittles” were played with bones and skulls at\r\nSt. Ann’s, Soho, and other churchyards. But I cannot entirely give up\r\nthe idea that Shakespeare walked in some churchyards which awoke\r\npeaceful and reverent thoughts in his contemplative mind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NINETEENTH-CENTURY TOMBSTONE.]\r\n\r\nStow scarcely mentions the churchyards at all. He and his later editors\r\ngive up many pages of his survey to inscriptions copied from monuments,\r\nsome being from tombstones in the churchyards, but most being from the\r\ntablets in the churches, and he occasionally refers to the gift by\r\ncitizens of pieces of ground for graveyards, these being mainly in the\r\nCity itself. Perhaps, however, it may not be out of place to quote from\r\none or two passages which give us an idea of the condition of the open\r\nland immediately adjoining the City, and which point to the fact that\r\nsuch parish churches as lay beyond this land must indeed have been rural\r\nand remote.\r\n\r\nWe read in the edition of 1633 that “filthie cottages” and alleys\r\nextended for “almost halfe a mile beyond” Whitechapel Church, “into the\r\ncommon field.” He also refers to the fine houses, with large gardens,\r\nwhich were being built round the City, where former generations, more\r\nbenevolently inclined, had erected hospitals and almshouses. He mentions\r\nthe “wrestlings” that took place at Bartholomewtide by “Skinners Well,\r\nneere unto Clarkes Well.” This Clarkes Well, or Clerkenwell, “is curbed\r\nabout square with hard stone: not farre from the west end of Clarkenwell\r\nChurch, but close without the wall that encloseth it.” ... “Somewhat\r\nnorth from Holywell (Shoreditch) is one other well, curbed square with\r\nstone, and is called Dame Annis the cleere; and not far from it, but\r\nsomewhat west, is also another cleere water, called Perilous Pond,\r\nbecause divers youths (by swimming therein) have been drowned.” Stow\r\nmost carefully enumerates the wells and conduits of the City and its\r\nsurroundings, several being “neere to the Church.” And it is a fact that\r\nmany wells, conduits, and pumps in and around London were—and some still\r\nare—not only in close proximity to the churchyards, but actually in\r\nthem. The water from St. Clement’s Well and St. Giles’ Well came through\r\nthe burial-grounds. The site of the Bride’s Well, which gave the name to\r\nthe precinct and the hospital, is still marked by the pump in an alcove\r\nof the wall of St. Bride’s Churchyard, Fleet Street. There was a pump by\r\nSt. Michael le Querne and one in the churchyard of St. Mary le Bow,\r\nagainst the west wall of the church. There was a well in the crypt of\r\nSt. Peter’s, Walworth, a pump in Stepney Churchyard, and another in St.\r\nGeorge’s in the East, to which his parishioners used to resort for\r\ndrinking water until the Rev. Harry Jones, during a cholera scare, hung\r\na large placard on it, “_Dead Men’s Broth!_” and Dickens used to picture\r\nthe departed, when he heard the churchyard pumps at work, urging their\r\nprotest, “Let us lie here in peace; don’t suck us up and drink us!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE VILLAGE OF SHOREDITCH.\r\n(_From Aggas’ Plan, 1560._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. PANCRAS VILLAGE.\r\n(_From Rocque’s Plan_, 1746.)]\r\n\r\nAnd Norden, what did he say? His plan of London, like the one by Aggas\r\nand later ones, gives us a picture of the remoteness of the outer\r\nparishes. Here is his description of old St. Pancras Churchyard:\r\n“Pancras Church standeth all alone, as utterly forsaken, old and\r\nwether-beaten, which, for the antiquity thereof, it is thought not to\r\nyield to Paules in London. About this church have bin many buildings now\r\ndecayed, leaving poor Pancras without companie or comfort, yet it is now\r\nand then visited with Kentishtowne and Highgate, which are members\r\nthereof.... When there is a corpse to be interred, they are forced to\r\nleave the same within this forsaken church or churchyard, when (no\r\ndoubt) it resteth as secure against the day of resurrection as if it\r\nlaie in stately Paules.” It would indeed be curious to see what Norden\r\nwould think now of this churchyard, with the Midland Railway trains\r\nunceasingly rushing across it, and the “dome” and “trophy” of\r\nheadstones, numbering 496, not to speak of the stacks and walls of them\r\nround about, which were moved into one part of the ground when the other\r\npart (Catholic Pancras) was acquired by the railway company. Poor\r\nPancras is not forsaken now, it is in the midst of streets and houses,\r\nand what remains of the churchyard is full of seats and people.\r\n\r\nThis particular ground, with others in the same neighbourhood, were\r\nfamed later on as the scenes of the operations of body-snatchers, as is\r\nevident from Tom Hood’s rhyme, entitled “Jack Hall,” from which one\r\nverse will be sufficient:—\r\n\r\n                 “At last—it may be, Death took spite,\r\n                  Or jesting only meant to fright—\r\n                  He sought for jack night after night\r\n                             The churchyards round;\r\n                  And soon they met, the man and sprite,\r\n                             In Pancras’ ground.”\r\n\r\nWhen Jack Hall is himself dying, and twelve M.D.’s are round him,\r\nanxious for his body, he tells them:—\r\n\r\n                         “I sold it thrice,\r\n                          Forgive my crimes!\r\n                   In short I have received its price\r\n                         A dozen times.”\r\n\r\nTimbs in his “Romance of London” gives a detailed account of the first\r\nindictment for body-stealing—the act taking place at St. George the\r\nMartyr ground (behind the Foundling Hospital) in 1777. But it must be\r\nremembered that, although at one time body-snatchers or resurrection-men\r\ncarried on a brisk trade, yet where one body may have been disinterred\r\nfor hospital use one hundred were removed to make room for others.\r\n\r\nThe churchyards in London to which a somewhat rural flavour still clings\r\nare, perhaps, those in the extreme south east, such as St. Nicholas’,\r\nPlumstead, and St. John the Baptist’s, Eltham, which, together with Lee\r\nand Tooting Churchyards, are still used for interments, St. Mary’s,\r\nBromley-by-Bow (originally the chapel of St. Mary in the Convent of St.\r\nLeonard), with its beautiful altar tombs, and St. Mary’s, Stoke\r\nNewington. There is something particularly picturesque about the last\r\nnamed, with the old church in its midst. Mrs. Barbauld lies buried here,\r\nand a lady whose death was caused by her clothes catching fire, upon\r\nwhose tombstone this very quaint inscription was placed:—\r\n\r\n    “Reader, if you should ever witness such an afflicting scene,\r\n    recollect that the only method to extinguish the flame, is to stifle\r\n    it by an immediate covering.”\r\n\r\nAll the parish churches had their churchyards, the only ones not\r\nactually adjoining them being those of St. George’s, Hanover Square, St.\r\nGeorge’s, Bloomsbury, and St. George the Martyr, Queen Square, where the\r\nfirst body interred was that of Robert Nelson, author of “Fasts and\r\nFestivals.” Some were added to many times, some have been seriously\r\ncurtailed. The largest of the churchyards are Stepney, Hackney, and\r\nCamberwell. That of St. Anne’s, Limehouse, had a strip taken off it in\r\n1800, when Commercial Road was made, that of St. Paul’s, Hammersmith,\r\nwas similarly curtailed in 1884. The present churches of Hammersmith and\r\nKensington are far larger than their predecessors, and therefore the\r\nchurchyards dwindled when they were built. St. Clement Danes and St.\r\nJohn’s, Westminster, once stood in fair-sized churchyards; now, in each\r\ncase, there is only a railed-in enclosure round the church. But one of\r\nthe most serious shortenings was at St. Martin’s in the Fields. In fact,\r\nof those buried from this particular parish, few can have been\r\nundisturbed, except, perhaps, in the cemetery in Pratt Street, Camden\r\nTown, now a public garden, which belongs to St. Martin’s. One of the\r\nparochial burial-grounds is under the northern block of the buildings\r\nforming the National Gallery, another one is lost in Charing Cross Road,\r\nwhile a third one (now a little garden) in Drury Lane was so\r\ndisgustingly overcrowded that no burials could take place there without\r\nthe disturbance of other bodies, which were crowded into pits dug in the\r\nground, and covered with boards. But to return to the churchyard itself,\r\nthe burial-ground immediately surrounding the church, where Nell Gwynne\r\nand Jack Sheppard were buried. A strip on the north side and a piece at\r\nthe east end still exist, flagged with stones, and were planted with\r\ntrees, provided with seats, and opened to the public by the Metropolitan\r\nPublic Gardens Association in 1887. But once there was a large piece of\r\nground on the south side, where now there is none, called the Waterman’s\r\nChurchyard. Its disappearance is accounted for by the following\r\ninscription on a tablet on the church wall:—\r\n\r\n    “These catacombs were constructed at the expense of the\r\n    Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Woods and Forests, in exchange for\r\n    part of the burial-ground of this parish, on the south side of the\r\n    church, given up for public improvements, and were consecrated by\r\n    the Lord Bishop of London on the 7th day of June, 1831.”\r\n\r\nIn _The Sunday Times_ of June 12, 1831, these vaults are thus\r\ndescribed:—\r\n\r\n“The new vaults under St. Martin’s burying-ground are the most capacious\r\nstructure of the sort in London. They were opened on Tuesday, at the\r\nconsecration of the new burial-ground. They consist of a series of\r\nvaults, running out of one another in various directions; they are\r\nlofty, and when lighted up, as on Tuesday, really presented something of\r\na comfortable appearance.” After relating something about the size and\r\nnumber of the arches, the quantity of coffins they would hold, &c., the\r\ndescription closes with these words: “Crowds of ladies perambulated the\r\nvaults for some time, and the whole had more the appearance of a\r\nfashionable promenade than a grim depository of decomposing mortality.”\r\n\r\nThis account reminds me very much of the ceremony which took place after\r\nthe opening of St. Peter’s Churchyard, Walworth, as a garden, in May,\r\n1895. The Rector had kindly provided tea in the crypt, a huge space\r\nunder the church where gymnastic and other classes are held. This crypt\r\nused to be full of coffins lying about at random, with a well in the\r\ncentre, but a faculty was obtained for their removal to a cemetery. The\r\nscene on the day to which I refer was a very gay one. Where, a few\r\nmonths previously, there had been coffins and dirt, there was a well\r\nwhite-washed building, lighted with plenty of gas, lace curtains between\r\nthe solid pillars and low arches, a number of little tables with tea,\r\ncakes, &c., and many brightly-attired girls to wait on the visitors, who\r\nenjoyed their refreshment to the enlivening strains of a piano.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE VILLAGE OF ST. GILES’ IN THE FIELDS.\r\n(_From Aggas’ Plan_, 1560.)]\r\n\r\nThe churchyard of St. Giles’ in the Fields is a very interesting one. It\r\nmight well be now called St. Giles’ in the Slums, although of late years\r\nthe surrounding streets have been much improved and the worst courts\r\ncleared away. Before there was a church of St. Giles’ there was a\r\nlazaretto or leper hospital on the spot, and what is now the churchyard\r\nwas the burial-ground attached thereto. As a parish the settlement seems\r\nto date from 1547, but the hospital was founded 200 years earlier, and\r\nwas entrusted to the care of the Master and Brethren of the Order of\r\nBurton St. Lazar of Jerusalem, in Leicestershire. The churchyard, which\r\nholds many centuries of dead, was frequently enlarged, Brown’s Gardens\r\nbeing added in 1628, until the parish secured an additional\r\nburial-ground, in 1803, adjoining that of St. Pancras. And yet it is\r\nbarely an acre in extent. It is related in Thornbury’s “Haunted London”\r\nthat in 1670 the sexton agreed to furnish the rector and churchwardens\r\nwith two fat capons, ready dressed, every Tuesday se’nnight in return\r\nfor being allowed to introduce certain windows into the churchyard side\r\nof his house. But it could not have been a pleasant churchyard to look\r\nat. It was always damp, and vast numbers of the poor Irish were buried\r\nin it (the ground having been originally consecrated by a Roman\r\nCatholic), and it is hardly to be wondered at that the parish of St.\r\nGiles’ enjoys the honour of having started the plague of 1665. And the\r\npractices carried on there at the beginning of this century were equal\r\nto the worst anywhere—revolting ill-treatment of the dead was the daily\r\ncustom.\r\n\r\nNow the churchyard is a public garden, Pendrell’s tombstone being an\r\nobject of historical interest, the inscription upon which runs as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n    “Here lieth Richard Pendrell, Preserver and Conductor to his sacred\r\n    Majesty King Charles the Second of Great Britain, after his Escape\r\n    from Worcester Fight, in the Year 1651, who died Feb. 8, 1671.\r\n\r\n            Hold, Passenger, here’s shrouded in this Herse,\r\n            Unparalell’d Pendrell, thro’ the Universe.\r\n            Like when the Eastern Star From Heaven gave Light\r\n            To three lost Kings; so he, in such dark Night,\r\n            To Britain’s Monarch, toss’d by adverse War,\r\n            On Earth appear’d, a Second Eastern Star,\r\n            A Pope, a Stern, in her rebellious Main,\r\n            A Film to her Royal Sovereign.\r\n            Now to triumph in Heav’n’s eternal Sphere,\r\n            He’s hence advanc’d, for his just Steerage here;\r\n            Whilst Albion’s Chronicles, with matchless Fame,\r\n            Embalm the Story of great Pendrell’s Name.”\r\n\r\nThis ridiculous epitaph belongs to the truly eulogistic group. It has\r\nits counterpart on a tombstone in Fulham Churchyard, erected to the\r\nmemory of a lady, where the epitaph is “Silence is best,” or in the\r\nfollowing one from Lambeth:—\r\n\r\n                        “Here lieth W. W.\r\n              Who nevermore will trouble you, trouble you.”\r\n\r\nOld Chelsea Church is noted for its monuments, many persons of\r\ndistinction having been buried there, and in the churchyard is a great\r\nerection in memory of Sir Hans Sloane, but the ground is closed to the\r\npublic, and the tombstones are sadly neglected. From a dramatic point of\r\nview the burial-ground attached to St. Paul’s, Covent Garden, is most\r\ninteresting, as it contains the graves of a large number of actors.\r\n\r\nSo many works have been written about monuments and epitaphs that it is\r\nnot my intention to refer to many, but some are interesting as giving a\r\npeep into the life of those they commemorate. There are several in\r\nLondon which describe the number of times the deceased person was\r\n“tapped for dropsy.” A tombstone at Stepney is in memory of one\r\n“Elizabeth Goodlad, who died in 1710, aged 99, and her twenty\r\ndaughters.” They must have been exemplary daughters not to have worn out\r\ntheir mother sooner! The Rev. Matthew Mead was also buried here, a most\r\nprolific writer of sermons and treatises on religion, including one with\r\nthis quaint title, “The almost Christian tried and cast.” Stepney\r\nChurchyard is very old; it is highly probable that there was a church\r\nthere in Saxon times. The other churchyards in East London which can\r\nboast of considerable antiquity are Bromley, Bow, Whitechapel, and\r\nHackney, although Sir Walter Besant, in his novel, “All Sorts and\r\nConditions of Men,” says that the churchyards in East London “are not\r\neven ancient.” No doubt if he re-wrote that novel now he would alter\r\nmany of his remarks. It is hardly possible to think that the eastern\r\ndistricts of London ever formed a “marvellous, unknown country,” or that\r\nRotherhithe needed any “discovery.”\r\n\r\nBy the close of the last century and at the beginning of this one, the\r\nwant of additional burial space was much felt in several parishes. Some\r\nhad “poor grounds,” and some, like St. James’s, Clerkenwell, had a\r\n“middle ground,” this particular one being now the playground of the\r\nBowling Green Lane Board School, but the extra graveyards were all small\r\nand all crowded. The parishes of St. Margaret’s, Westminster, St.\r\nJames’s, Piccadilly, St. Andrew’s, Holborn, St. James’s, Clerkenwell,\r\nSt. Marylebone, and St. Mary’s, Islington, secured additional\r\nburial-grounds in which chapels of ease were erected. These are Christ\r\nChurch, Victoria Street, St. James’s, Hampstead Road, Holy Trinity,\r\nGray’s Inn Road, St. James’s, Pentonville Road, St. John’s Wood Chapel,\r\nand the Chapel of Ease in Holloway Road, the ground surrounding which is\r\none of the best kept churchyard gardens in London. Many of the district\r\nchurches, built at the commencement of this century, also had graveyards\r\nattached. In Bethnal Green, for instance, not only is there the\r\nburial-ground of St. Matthew’s, which was consecrated in 1746, and has\r\nvaults under the school as well as the church, but there are those of\r\nSt. Peter’s, St. Bartholomew’s, and St. James’ the Less, the two first\r\nbeing laid out as gardens, and the last being a dreary, swampy waste,\r\ncontaining about ten sad-looking tombstones and a colony of cocks and\r\nhens.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, in a chapter already too long, to touch upon all the\r\nchurchyards outside the City, but I must refer briefly to the four\r\nprincipal parish churches which have disappeared. The present building\r\nof St. Mary le Strand only dates from 1717; the original one stood in a\r\n“fair cemetery,” much nearer the river, and was also called the Church\r\nof the Innocents. This ground was enlarged in 1355 by a plot 70 feet by\r\n30 feet in size, but the church and churchyard disappeared about 1564 to\r\nmake room for Somerset House. The church of St. John the Evangelist,\r\nTybourn, was removed in 1400 by Bishop Braybrooke, and the first church\r\nof St. Marylebone was built to take its place. Provision was made for\r\nthe preservation of the churchyard, but it also disappeared before long.\r\nIt was near the site of the present Court House in Stratford Place,\r\nunder which, and the older one, bones were dug up in 1727 and 1822.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SITE OF ST. KATHARINE’S DOCKS.\r\n(_From Rocque’s Plan, 1746._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. MATTHEW’S, BETHNAL GREEN, 1818.]\r\n\r\nTybourn Church was removed because it was in so lonely a situation, and\r\nyet so near the main road from Oxford to London, that robbers and\r\nthieves were always breaking into it to steal the bells, images,\r\nornaments, &c. The Church of St. Margaret, Southwark, stood in the\r\nmiddle of the Borough High Street, with a much-used graveyard round it,\r\nwhich was enlarged in 1537. But it was in so inconvenient a place, and\r\nthe ground was so much used for holding markets in, that it was removed\r\nabout 1600, and the parish amalgamated with St. Saviour’s. The old town\r\nhall took the place of the church, and the Borough Market is still held\r\non or near the site of the churchyard. When St. Katharine’s Docks were\r\nmade, in 1827, St. Katharine’s Church, the ruins of the hospital (dating\r\nfrom 1148), two churchyards of considerable size, and the whole\r\nparish,—inns, streets, houses and all, were totally annihilated. The\r\nchurch was a beautiful one; it has been described by Sir Walter Besant\r\nand other chroniclers, and must have been amongst the finest specimens\r\nof ecclesiastical architecture in London. The whole establishment was,\r\nto a certain extent, rebuilt near Regent’s Park. It is said that a\r\nquantity of the human remains from the churchyard were used to fill up\r\nsome old reservoirs, &c., in the neighbourhood; but, at any rate, it is\r\na fact that they were distributed amongst the East-end churchyards, and\r\nseveral cartloads were taken to Bethnal Green and deposited in St.\r\nMatthew’s ground, where the slope up to the west door of the church is\r\ncomposed of these bodies from St. Katharine’s. There were originally\r\nsteps leading to the entrance, but the steps are buried under this\r\nartificial hill, the ground having been raised several inches.\r\n\r\nWhat may be called the parish churchyards in London, outside the City,\r\nnumber about seventy-two. Of these no less than forty are now being\r\nmaintained as public gardens, and this does not include the additional\r\nparochial graveyards, nor those attached to district churches. A few,\r\nsuch as Streatham and Hampstead, are generally open to the public, but\r\nare not provided with seats, and one of the best kept is that of St.\r\nBartholomew’s, Sydenham, which, although not a public garden, is indeed\r\n“a thing of beauty.” The old churchyard at Lee is also attractive, and\r\ncontains tombs and effigies belonging to many families of note,\r\nincluding those of the Ropers, Boones, and Floodyers, and a monument to\r\nthe memory of Sir Fretful Plagiary, of whom, notwithstanding the\r\nuncomfortable name with which he was endowed, his epitaph says, “He\r\nscience knew, knew manners, knew the age.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                      PEST-FIELDS AND PLAGUE-PITS.\r\n\r\n                  “From plague, pestilence, and famine,\r\n                             Good Lord, deliver us.”\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSIDERING that we have records of the visitation of London by direful\r\nplagues and pestilences at frequent intervals during ten centuries, and\r\nthat these visitations always led to a mortality far in excess of the\r\nordinary one, it is not to be wondered at that from time to time special\r\nburial-places had to be provided to meet the special need. In 664,\r\nduring the time of the Saxon Heptarchy, London was “ravaged by the\r\nplague,” and from that date forward it returned again and again, causing\r\nthe kings, the courtiers and the richer citizens to be constantly\r\nfleeing for safety into the country, until the final and awful calamity\r\nof 1665. According to some authorities the plague has never re-appeared\r\nsince then, although according to others a few cases occurred annually\r\nuntil the year 1679. But after that time, although there was a division\r\nfor “the Plague” in the annual Bills of Mortality, there were no entries\r\nagainst it, and after 1703 we cease even to see the word recorded. In\r\nearly days the visitations were so ordinary that, when mentioned in the\r\nhistories of London, they are not taken much account of. Here is one\r\nrecord: “The plague making its appearance in France in 1361, the king to\r\nguard against the contagion spreading in London, ordered that all cattle\r\nfor the use of the city should be slaughtered either at Stratford on one\r\nside the town, or at Knightsbridge on the other side, to keep the air\r\nfree from filthy and putrid smells. This regulation was certainly\r\nwholesome; but the close dwellings of which the city then consisted,\r\nwere always fit receptacles for contagious disorders; the plague\r\naccordingly came over, and in two days destroyed 1,200 persons.” If an\r\ninfectious disorder were to carry off 1,200 persons in two days in\r\nLondon now, when the population is counted by millions instead of by\r\nthousands, there would be a general panic, a special inquiry, and,\r\nperhaps, a Royal Commission.\r\n\r\nIn 1349 two large tracts of land were set aside for the interment of\r\nthose who then died of the plague, and as their history is generally\r\nwell known, I will give Noorthouck’s somewhat concise account: “At\r\nlength it (a great pestilence) reached London, where the common\r\ncemeteries were not capacious enough to receive the vast number of\r\nbodies, so that several well-disposed persons were induced to purchase\r\nground to supply that defect. Amongst the rest, Ralph Stratford, Bishop\r\nof London, bought a piece of ground, called No-Man’s-Land, which he\r\ninclosed with a brick wall, and dedicated to the burial of the dead.\r\nAdjoining to this was a place called Spittle Croft, the property of St.\r\nBartholomew’s Hospital, containing thirteen acres and a rod of ground,\r\nwhich was purchased for the same use of burying the dead by Sir Walter\r\nManny, and was long remembered by an inscription fixed on a stone cross\r\nupon the premises. On this burial-ground the Charterhouse now stands.\r\nThere was also another piece of ground purchased at the east end of the\r\nCity, just without the wall, by one John Corey, a clergyman, for the\r\nsame use; on which spot was afterwards, in this same reign, founded the\r\nAbbey of St. Mary of Grace, for Cistercian monks; it is now covered by\r\nthe victualling-office and adjoining houses. It was asserted that not\r\none in ten escaped this calamity, and that not less than 100,000 persons\r\ndied in the whole.” The next sentence is characteristic of the way in\r\nwhich, as I have already said, these visitations were treated.\r\n“Notwithstanding this sad misfortune, the city soon recovered itself,\r\nand advanced greatly in prosperity, as will appear by a charter it\r\nobtained in the year 1354, granting the privilege of having gold or\r\nsilver maces carried before the chief magistrate.” The translation of\r\nthe Latin inscription on the stone cross on Sir Walter de Manny’s ground\r\nis as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “A great plague raging in the year of our Lord 1349, this\r\n    burial-ground was consecrated, wherein, and within the bounds of the\r\n    present monastery, were buried more than 50,000 bodies of the dead,\r\n    beside many others thenceforward to the present time: whose souls\r\n    the Lord have mercy upon. Amen.”\r\n\r\nThe space called No-Man’s-Land was three acres in extent and was\r\nafterwards known as the Pardon Churchyard, being used for the interment\r\nof executed people and suicides. It was in use long after the Cistercian\r\nMonastery was built on the Spittle Croft. Wilderness Row, now merged\r\ninto Clerkenwell Road, marks its site, while the gardens and courts of\r\nthe Charterhouse, the Square, the site of a demolished burial-ground for\r\nthe pensioners (Sutton’s Ground), and the burial-ground which still\r\nexists at the north end of the precincts, are all part of the Spittle\r\nCroft and of the monastery burial-ground. There have already been\r\nattempts to do away with the Charterhouse, to substitute streets and\r\nhouses for the old buildings, gardens, and courts, but happily it is not\r\nso easy as it once was to tamper with land consecrated for burials, even\r\nthough that land may have been set aside 550 years ago. The\r\n“Victualling-office,” which took the place of St. Mary’s Abbey, was\r\nwhere the Royal Mint at present stands, and, if one may trust William\r\nNewton’s plan, the abbey graveyard was where the entrance courtyard is\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nThe numbers who died in subsequent visitations must have helped not a\r\nlittle to fill the parish churchyards, but it was not until the year of\r\nthe Great Plague that there seems to have been any very general\r\nprovision of extra ground, although the pest-house ground in the Irish\r\nField, “nye” Old Street, was consecrated in 1662, especially for the\r\nparish of St. Giles, Cripplegate.\r\n\r\nBut the plague of 1665 taxed the resources, the patience, and the energy\r\nof the Mayor, magistrates, and citizens of London in a manner that was\r\nunprecedented. All through that fatal summer and autumn, and on into the\r\ncommencement of the following year, did it play havoc with the people.\r\nIn August and September it was at its height. The exact number of\r\npersons who died could not be known, for thousands of deaths were never\r\nrecorded. Bodies were collected by the dead carts, which were filled and\r\nemptied and filled again from sunset to dawn, and no account was kept of\r\nthe numbers thrown into the pits. At any rate, between August 6th and\r\nOctober 10th, 49,605 deaths were registered in the Bills of Mortality as\r\nfrom the Plague, and Defoe, whose “Journal of the Plague” gives every\r\ndetail that any one can wish for, considered that during the visitation\r\nat least 100,000 must have perished, in addition to those who wandered\r\naway with the disease upon them and died in the outlying districts. “The\r\nnumber of those miserable objects was great. The country people would go\r\nand dig a hole at a distance from them, and then, with long poles and\r\nhooks at the end of them, drag the bodies into these pits, and then\r\nthrow the earth in from as far as they could cast it, to cover them.” It\r\nis pretty certain that many unrecorded burials took place in the fields\r\nof Stoke Newington.\r\n\r\nLondon must have been a sad sight. All shows, pleasures and pastimes\r\nwere stopped; people crowded continually into the churches, where\r\ndissenting ministers, notwithstanding the Act of Uniformity which was\r\nthen in force, occupied the pulpits of deceased or absent vicars, and\r\npreached to the most attentive listeners; huge fires were always burning\r\nin the streets; children were kept out of the churchyards; the city was\r\ncleared of all “hogs, dogs, cats, tame pigeons and conies,” special\r\n“dog-killers” being employed; and food and assistance was daily given to\r\nthe most needy; while those who could afford to do so fled into the\r\ncountry, except a few devoted physicians, justices, and other helpers,\r\nincluding the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Earl of Craven, Monk\r\n(afterwards Duke of Marlborough), and Gilbert Latey and George Whitehead\r\n(Quakers).\r\n\r\nThe plague, introduced from Holland, first broke out in Long Acre, and\r\ngradually spread all over London. When it became impossible to bury in\r\nthe ordinary way, huge pits were dug in the churchyards and bodies were\r\ndeposited in them without coffins. The chief plague-pit in Aldgate\r\nChurchyard was about 40 ft. long, 15 or 16 ft. broad, and 20 ft. deep,\r\nand between the 6th and the 20th of September, 1,114 bodies were thrown\r\ninto it. But it soon became necessary to make new burial-grounds and new\r\npits for the reception of the dead, as the “common graves of every\r\nparish” became full.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PEST-HOUSES IN TOTHILL FIELDS.]\r\n\r\nThere were pest-houses in the ground to the north of Old Street and in\r\nTothill Fields, Westminster, to which infected persons were taken. They\r\ncorresponded to the isolation hospitals of to-day. But they could only\r\naccommodate, at the most, 300 patients or so, and were wholly inadequate\r\nto meet the need. The pest-houses in Old Street, or rather Bath Street,\r\nwere long ago destroyed; Pest-House Row and Russell Row used to mark\r\ntheir sites. But a portion of the pest-field exists in the garden behind\r\nthe St. Luke’s Lunatic Asylum, which was used as a burial-ground for the\r\nparish of St. Giles, Cripplegate, until the formation, in 1732, of St.\r\nLuke’s parish, when it became the St Luke’s “poor ground.” The\r\npest-houses in Tothill Fields were standing at the beginning of the\r\npresent century. They were known as the “five houses” or the “seven\r\nchimneys,” and were erected in 1642. The Tothill Fields, no longer being\r\nneeded as a plague burial-ground, were subsequently built upon, but not\r\nuntil they had been used for the burial of 1,200 Scotch military\r\nprisoners with their wives. A considerable portion of the fields is,\r\nhowever, still open, and is known as Vincent Square, the playground of\r\nthe Westminster School boys. Mackenzie Walcott, in his Memorials of\r\nWestminster, states that Harding’s stoneyard in Earl Street is the site\r\nof the principal plague-pit. This, I believe, is now the yard of Her\r\nMajesty’s Stationery Office, Waste Paper Department.\r\n\r\nDefoe gives a very careful description of some of the plague-pits and\r\nburial-grounds which were made in his immediate neighbourhood. He\r\nmentions—\r\n\r\n1. “A piece of ground beyond Goswell Street, near Mount Mill, ... where\r\nabundance were buried promiscuously from the Parishes of Aldersgate,\r\nClerkenwell, and even out of the city. This ground, as I take it, was\r\nsince made a Physick Garden, and after that has been built upon.” Mount\r\nMill was on the north side of Seward Street.\r\n\r\n2. “A piece of ground just over the Black Ditch, as it was then called,\r\nat the end of Holloway Lane, in Shoreditch Parish; it has been since\r\nmade a Yard for keeping Hogs, and for other ordinary Uses, but is quite\r\nout of Use for a burying-ground.”\r\n\r\nThis Holywell Mount burial-ground has been “in use” again since Defoe’s\r\ntime, and was also used as a plague-pit before 1665. Originally the site\r\nof a theatre dating from the time of Shakespeare, and named after the\r\nneighbouring Holywell Convent in King John’s Court, it afterwards became\r\na burial-ground, famous as being used for the interment of a great many\r\nactors. There is a small part of it left, but at the outside not more\r\nthan a quarter of an acre. It is behind the church of St. James’,\r\nCurtain Road, and is approached by a passage from Holywell Row. A parish\r\nroom has been built on it, and what remains is used as a timber yard.\r\nThe piece between the parish room and the church is bare and untidy.\r\n\r\n3. The third place mentioned by Defoe was at “the Upper end of Hand\r\nAlley in Bishopsgate Street, which was then a green field, and was taken\r\nin particularly for Bishopsgate Parish, tho’ many of the Carts out of\r\nthe City brought their dead thither also, particularly out of the Parish\r\nof Allhallows on the Wall.”\r\n\r\nHe then goes on to describe how this place was very soon built upon,\r\nthough the bodies were, in many cases, still undecomposed, and he states\r\nthat the remains of 2,000 persons were put into a pit and railed round\r\nin an adjoining passage. New Street, Bishopsgate Street, now occupies\r\nthe site of Hand Alley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STEPNEY CHURCHYARD.]\r\n\r\n4. “Besides this there was a piece of ground in Moorfields,” &c. Here he\r\nrefers to the Bethlem burial-ground, which was not made at that time,\r\nbut enlarged. Defoe finally mentions the extra grounds which had to be\r\nsupplied in Stepney, then a very largely extended parish. They included\r\na piece of ground adjoining the churchyard, which was afterwards added\r\nto it; and in 1886, in laying out this churchyard as a public garden,\r\nsome human remains, without coffins, and very close to the surface, were\r\naccidentally disturbed at the south-western side of the ground. Another\r\nof the Stepney pest-grounds was in Spitalfields, “where since a chapel\r\nor Tabernacle has been built for ease to this great parish.” I believe\r\nit to be St. Mary, Spital Square. Another was in Petticoat Lane. “There\r\nwere no less than five other grounds made use of for the Parish of\r\nStepney at that time, one where now stands the Parish Church of St.\r\nPaul’s, Shadwell, and the other where now stands the Parish Church of\r\nSt. John at Wapping.” The churchyards of these two churches, the former\r\nof which is a public garden, and the latter of which is still closed,\r\nare therefore survivals of pest-fields. But there are three other places\r\nto account for which Defoe does not localise. One was possibly in\r\nGower’s Walk, Whitechapel, where human remains, without coffins, were\r\ncome upon recently in digging the foundation for Messrs. Kinloch’s new\r\nbuildings. The remains were moved in boxes to a railway arch in\r\nBattersea in the winter of 1893-4. I saw this excavation myself, the\r\nlayer of black earth, intermingled with bones, being between two layers\r\nof excellent gravel soil. One additional ground bought at the time of\r\nthe Plague was on the north side of Mile End Road. By about 1745 it was\r\nused as a market-garden, and now the site is occupied by houses south of\r\nthe junction of Lisbon and Collingwood Streets, Cambridge Road. Besides\r\nthese it is certain that a large tract of land south of the London\r\nHospital was also used for interments, and the Brewer’s Garden and the\r\nsite of St. Philip’s Church were probably parts of this ground, which\r\nwas known as Stepney Mount. On the north side of Corporation Row,\r\nClerkenwell, in digging foundations for artisan’s dwellings, a number of\r\nhuman remains were recently found. This site may have been a plague-pit,\r\nor it may have been a burial-ground for an old Bridewell close by, or an\r\noverflow from the graveyard in Bowling Green Lane.\r\n\r\nThe chief place of interment for those who died of the plague in\r\nSouthwark was the burial-ground in Deadman’s Place (now called Park\r\nStreet). Here vast numbers of bodies were buried. The graveyard was\r\nafterwards attached to an Independent Chapel, and many eminent\r\nDissenters were buried there, for it soon became a sort of Bunhill\r\nFields For South London. Now the carts, the trucks, and the barrels in\r\nMessrs. Barclay and Perkins’ Brewery roll on rails over the remains of\r\nthe victims of the plague and the Dissenting ministers with their\r\nflocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SITE OF THE BREWER’S GARDEN ABOUT 1830.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DISSENTERS’ BURIAL-GROUND IN DEADMAN’S PLACE.\r\n(_From Rocque’s Plan, 1746._)]\r\n\r\nBut pest-fields were needed in the west of London, as well as in the\r\nnorth, south, and east, and in addition to Tothill Fields there was a\r\nlarge tract of land set aside near Poland Street, upon the site of which\r\nthe St. James’s Workhouse was subsequently built, a piece of the ground\r\nsurviving still in the workhouse garden. Carnaby Market and Marshall\r\nStreet were also built on the site about the year 1723, when three\r\nacres, known as Upton Farm, were given in exchange in the fields of\r\nBaynard’s Watering Place (Bayswater), upon which Craven Hill Gardens now\r\nstands. There was a plague-pit near Golden Square, this district being\r\nall a part of the pest-field at one time.\r\n\r\nThe orchard of Normand House, by Lillie Road, Fulham, is said, by Mrs.\r\nS. C. Hall, to have been filled with bodies in the year of the Great\r\nPlague. The site of this orchard has almost gone; Lintaine Grove, and\r\nthe houses on the north side of Lillie Road were built upon it. There is\r\nstill a piece vacant, and for sale, at the corner of Tilton Street,\r\nabout three-quarters of an acre in extent. Knightsbridge Green (opposite\r\nTattersalls) was also used for the victims of the Plague, and those who\r\ndied in the Lazar Hospital. Such are all the records of plague-pits and\r\npest-fields which I think sufficiently authentic to record.\r\n\r\nThere used to be an additional burial-ground for Aldgate parish in\r\nCartwright Street, E., consecrated in 1615. This, at the beginning of\r\nthe present century, was covered with small houses, and on a part of the\r\nsite the Weigh House School was built in 1846. The rookery was cleared\r\nby the Metropolitan Board of Works nearly forty years later, when Darby\r\nStreet was made, and the vacant land was offered as a site for artisans’\r\ndwellings. I brought the case to the notice of the Metropolitan Public\r\nGardens Association, and the Board was communicated with. At first it\r\nwas denied that any part of the site had been a burial-ground, but\r\nexcavations were made and human remains were found. Nor was this really\r\nnecessary, for the workmen who had pulled down the houses, and the\r\nauthorities at the school, were well aware of the fact, and knew of\r\nactual tombstones being unearthed, upon which a date as late as 1806 had\r\nbeen found. The Board of Works caused the plans for the surrounding new\r\nbuildings to be altered, and what is left of the site of the\r\nburial-ground is now an asphalted playground adjoining the southern\r\nblock. A certain gentleman afterwards wrote and circulated a pamphlet,\r\nin which he stated that the Metropolitan Board of Works had discovered\r\none of the “seites” set apart in Whitechapel for a pest-ground in 1349,\r\nwhereas the fact was that the Board had been driven, somewhat against\r\nits will, to preserve as an open space the site of a consecrated\r\nburial-ground belonging to the parish of St. Botolph, Aldgate. That it\r\nmay once have been a part of a pest-field is likely enough, for they\r\nabounded in the district, but the age of the Aldgate ground was, I\r\nconsider, sufficient to account for the driest of the dry bones found\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Plague has not re-appeared, there have been periods of\r\ngreat mortality from other diseases. Special provisions for burial had\r\nto be made at the time of the cholera visitations. In the outbreak of\r\n1832, 196 bodies were interred in a plot of ground adjoining the\r\nadditional burial-ground for Whitechapel (now the playground of the\r\nDavenant Schools). A large piece of ground by the churchyard of All\r\nSaints, Poplar, on the north side of the Rectory, was also used for the\r\npurpose, and the circumstance is recorded on the monument which stands\r\nin the middle of it.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the bodies in the pest-fields and plague-pits were usually\r\nburied without coffins, and were only wrapped in rugs, sheets, &C., has\r\naccelerated their decay, and it can no longer be thought dangerous when\r\nsuch pits are opened. Not that I wish in any way to defend the\r\ndisturbance of human remains, for I hold that no ground in which\r\ninterments have taken place should be used for any other purpose than\r\nthat of an open space, and, apart from the legal and sentimental aspects\r\nof the question, human remains, in whatever state of decay they may be,\r\nare not fit foundations for buildings, nor is it seemly or proper to\r\ngather them up and burn them in a hole, or to cram them promiscuously\r\ninto chests or “black boxes,” to be padlocked and deposited in other\r\ngrounds or convenient vaults. But the old plague-pits, the very crowded\r\nchurchyards, and the private grounds where the soil was saturated with\r\nquicklime, the coffins smashed at once, and decay in every way hurried,\r\nare likely now to be less insalubrious than those grounds where lead and\r\noaken coffins—specially intended to last for generations—are still in\r\ngood preservation, and only occasionally give way and let out the\r\nputrifactive emanations.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                    THE DISSENTERS’ BURIAL-GROUNDS.\r\n\r\n    “Methodism was only to be detected as you detect curious larvæ, by\r\n    diligent search in dirty corners.”—GEORGE ELIOT.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREMOST amongst the burial-grounds devoted especially to Dissenters is\r\nBunhill Fields,—not the New Bunhill Fields in Newington, nor Little\r\nBunhill Fields in Islington, nor the City Bunhill Ground in Golden Lane,\r\nnot the Quakers’ ground in Bunhill Row—but the real, genuine, original\r\nBunhill Fields, City Road.\r\n\r\nThe land on the north side of the City and south of Old Street was\r\nvariously called the Moorfields, Finsbury Fields, the Artillery Ground,\r\nWindmill Hill, and Bone-hill or Bon-hill. In the year 1549, when the\r\nCharnel Chapel in St. Paul’s Churchyard was pulled down, “the bones of\r\nthe dead, couched up in a charnel under the chapel, were conveyed from\r\nthence into Finsbury Field, by report of him who paid for the carriage,\r\namounting to more than one thousand cartloads, and there laid on a\r\nmoorish ground, which, in a short time after, being raised by the\r\nsoilage of the City, was able to bear three windmills.” The number of\r\nwindmills was, later on, increased to five, and they may be seen on many\r\nold maps of London. Heretics used to be interred in Moorfields, and\r\nbones from St. Matthew’s, Friday Street, were moved to Haggerston, in\r\nfact several acres in this district were in use for the purpose of\r\nburying in.\r\n\r\nThe land north of the Artillery Ground was known as Bonhill or Bunhill\r\nField, “part whereof, at present denominated Tindal’s, or the\r\nDissenters’ great Burial-ground, was, by the Mayor and Citizens of\r\nLondon, in the year 1665, set apart and consecrated as a common\r\nCemetery, for the interment of such corps as could not have room in\r\ntheir parochial burial-grounds in that dreadful year of pestilence.\r\nHowever, it not being made use of on that occasion, the said Tindal took\r\na lease thereof, and converted it into a Burial-ground for the use of\r\nDissenters.” So wrote Maitland in 1756, but before that time a large\r\nplot was added on the north, and eventually the whole cemetery measured\r\nabout five acres. There at least 100,000 persons found their last\r\nresting-place, including vast numbers of Methodist, Baptist,\r\nPresbyterian, and Independent ministers. In Walter Wilson’s History of\r\nthe Dissenting Meeting-houses, which might be more rightly called a\r\nhistory of dissenting divines, the burial of the ministers in Bunhill\r\nFields is constantly mentioned, and the elaborate inscriptions from\r\ntheir tombs are given. These have, however, become much defaced, and\r\nnumbers of them are now illegible. The ground belongs to the\r\nCorporation; it is not laid out as a garden, but paths have been made\r\nand seats placed in it, the gates being open during the day. The most\r\nfrequented paths lead to the tombstones of John Bunyan, on the south\r\nside of the public thoroughfare in “Tyndal’s Ground,” and Daniel Defoe,\r\non the north side, both being at the eastern end of the cemetery.\r\nBunyan’s tomb was restored in 1862 by public subscription, a piece of\r\nthe original stone being now in the Congregational Church at Highgate.\r\nThe monument to Defoe was raised in 1870 by a subscription in the\r\n_Christian World_. Amongst other celebrities buried here were Dr.\r\nWilliams, the founder of the Library in Red Cross Street (now in Gordon\r\nSquare), Susannah Wesley, mother of John and Charles, Isaac Watts, Sir\r\nThomas Hardy of Reform Bill fame, and several members of the Cromwell\r\nfamily. The Corporation restored the tombstone of Henry Cromwell, which\r\nwas found seven feet below the surface.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of the Thames the largest and most important of the\r\nDissenters’ burial-grounds was that attached to the Independent Chapel\r\nin Deadman’s Place (now called Park Street, Southwark), originally a\r\nplague-ground, and very much used for the burial of the victims. Here\r\nmany more ministers were buried, whose names are household words\r\nwherever Dissenters are gathered together. I cannot say what has become\r\nof their tombstones, but the site of the ground is now only one of the\r\npaved yards in Messrs. Barclay and Perkins’ Brewery.\r\n\r\nIf the mantle of Bunhill Fields has fallen anywhere, I suppose that\r\nAbney Park Cemetery claims the distinction. It was first used in 1840,\r\nand has always been the favourite cemetery of the Dissenters, there\r\nbeing no separating line in it to mark off a consecrated portion. Its\r\nformation is also associated with the memory of Dr. Watts, who lived for\r\nsome years, and who died, in the neighbourhood, at the house of his\r\nfriend Sir Thomas Abney. There is a monument to him in the cemetery,\r\nalthough he was buried at Bunhill Fields, and there are many huge\r\nmonuments to other eminent dissenting divines of latter days. The\r\ntombstones are crowded together as closely as it seems possible, and yet\r\nthey are being constantly added to, although the greater part of this\r\ncemetery is already over-full.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNION CHAPEL, WOOLWICH.]\r\n\r\nThe first dissenting meeting-houses were in the City and its immediate\r\nneighbourhood. They were frequently but “upper rooms” in narrow courts,\r\nand had no graveyards attached to them. But when the persecution of the\r\nDissenters, under the Act of Uniformity, was relaxed, meeting-houses and\r\nchapels sprang up in every part of London, and these, in some cases, had\r\nburial-grounds adjoining them. A few of the larger grounds, such as\r\nSheen’s, in Commercial Road, and the one in Globe Fields, were bought by\r\nprivate individuals and carried on as private speculations entirely\r\napart from the Chapels. They are described in Chapter IX. But of the\r\ngenuine Dissenters’ graveyards _i.e._, the little grounds attached to\r\nchapels and meeting-houses in London, there must have been at one time\r\nor another about eighty—there may have been more. This number of course\r\nrepresents but a very small portion of the meeting-houses themselves,\r\nwhich were in existence at the beginning of this century. The following\r\nremarks of the Rev. John Blackburn, one of the secretaries of the Union\r\nof Congregational Ministers, show how the respectable Dissenters\r\nrepudiated the private burial-grounds: “I may with confidence disclaim\r\nthe imputation that the graveyards of Dissenters were primarily and\r\nchiefly established with a view to emolument. Many graveyards that are\r\nprivate property, purchased by undertakers for their own emolument, are\r\nregarded as dissenting burial-grounds; and we are implicated in the\r\ncensures that are pronounced upon the unseemly and disgusting\r\ntransactions that have been detected in them.... By far the greatest\r\nportion of the persons buried in these grounds are not Dissenters at\r\nall.... The denomination to which I belong have about 120 chapels in and\r\naround London, and I believe there is not more than a sixth part of them\r\nthat have graveyards attached.”\r\n\r\nIn the returns of the Metropolitan burial-grounds which were made fifty\r\nor sixty years ago, those to whom the work was entrusted generally\r\nexpressed their inability to find out the correct number of the\r\nDissenters’ grounds, and Walker wrote, “I have not been able to procure\r\nany satisfactory accounts of the numbers interred in burying-grounds\r\nunconnected with the Established Church. By some parties information was\r\nrefused, by others the records of the place were stated to have been\r\nlost or neglected, and in some cases the parties most interested in\r\nsuppressing, had alone the power to communicate.” When I first began,\r\ntwelve years ago, to make as complete a list as I could of the London\r\nburial-grounds, I wrote to the secretaries at the centres of the chief\r\ndissenting bodies, as I thought they might possess information about the\r\nburial-grounds of their own chapels. From the Congregationalists I had\r\nno reply; the Wesleyans kindly answered that they were endeavouring to\r\nprocure the information, but it never came; the Baptists wrote two or\r\nthree letters and took some trouble on my behalf, but they failed even\r\nto find the number of their grounds. I had, therefore, to seek my\r\ninformation in other ways.\r\n\r\nThe only body of Nonconformists that has kept a careful account of its\r\ngraveyards is the Society of Friends. They also treated their grounds\r\nand the remains in them with greater respect (except in one notable case\r\nto which I shall refer), and they kept them neat and clean, and do so\r\nstill. Walker recognised this fact as long ago as 1847. A statement\r\nrespecting their graveyards was made by representatives of the Society\r\nto the committee which sat in 1843, showing that they still had\r\nconsiderable room in these grounds, and that they were careful not to\r\nallow less than 7 feet or 8 feet of earth above each coffin. The Friends\r\nattend to all matters connected with their meeting-houses and\r\nburial-grounds at their six weeks’ meeting, and each of these grounds\r\nhas been a Quakers’ graveyard from the beginning, not changing hands,\r\nfirst belonging to one community and then another, as has been the case\r\nwith so many of the chapel graveyards. The members of the Society have\r\nalso exercised a most praiseworthy self-control by not wearing mourning,\r\nby avoiding useless expense at funerals, and ostentatious tombstones,\r\nmemorials, or epitaphs. Until about fifty years ago no tombstones were\r\nused at all, as at Long Lane, S.E.; then they used small flat ones, as\r\nat Hammersmith and Peckham; and finally they adopted small upright ones,\r\nall the same shape, about a quarter of the size of the ordinary\r\nheadstones in cemeteries. These may be seen at Ratcliff and Stoke\r\nNewington, the graveyard at the latter place, which surrounds the Park\r\nStreet meeting-house, being still in use. I wish that every one who\r\nintends to erect a tombstone—and this is a note for Jews as well as\r\nChristians—would, before doing so, pay a visit to a Quakers’\r\nburial-ground, and ponder on the matter there. An interesting article on\r\nthe Society of Friends has appeared in the _Times_ of January 8, 1896,\r\nin which the following words are quoted, “The Quakers—the man and the\r\nSociety—must move or perish.” But I trust they may not move forward with\r\nthe times in adopting more elaborate burial customs.\r\n\r\nFour of the Quakers’ graveyards have entirely disappeared. The\r\nburial-ground for the Friends of Westminster was in Long Acre, by Castle\r\nStreet. It passed out of their hands in 1757, and was built upon. In\r\nrebuilding houses on the same spot, about four years ago, many human\r\nremains were disturbed. These were claimed by the Society, which was\r\nallowed to collect them and bury them at Isleworth. There was a little\r\nmeeting-house with a burial-ground attached in Wapping Street, which\r\nseems to have been used until about 1779, but was then demolished, the\r\nworshippers moving to the meeting in Brook Street, Ratcliff. The other\r\ntwo burial-grounds which the Friends have lost were in Worcester Street\r\nand Ewer Street, Southwark. The latter, although it adjoined their Old\r\nPark Meeting (which the King took as a guard house), may never have been\r\nused by them. At any rate in 1839 it was in private hands, and\r\neventually disappeared under the railway. The former, which dated from\r\n1666, was very full, so that in 1733 the surface was raised above the\r\noriginal level. This was demolished when Southwark Street was made\r\n(1860); and the London Bridge and Charing Cross Railway also runs over\r\nits site. The Friends then moved the remains and a number of coffins to\r\ntheir ground in Long Lane, Bermondsey.[4]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  A most interesting report upon this removal was made by the Surveyor\r\n  to the six weeks’ meeting, in which are contained some excellent\r\n  remarks upon the futility of burying in lead coffins, nine of these\r\n  being found in the ground. The graveyard had been disused since 1799.\r\n\r\nThe Quakers of the Bull-and-Mouth and Peel Divisions used a large ground\r\nnear Bunhill Fields, between Checquer Alley and Coleman (now Roscoe)\r\nStreet. It was acquired in 1661, and many times added to, and was used\r\nextensively by them at the time of the Great Plague, when they had their\r\nown special dead-cart. George Fox’s body was carried here in 1690, an\r\norderly procession, numbering 4,000 persons, following to the grave. In\r\n1840 a school was built in it, and the rest of the tale it grieves me to\r\ntell. A part of the burial-ground exists now, not half an acre in area.\r\nIt is neatly laid out as a sort of private garden. Five thousand bodies\r\nwere dug up in the other part and buried, with carbolic acid, in a\r\ncorner of the existing piece, and the site from which they were removed\r\nis now covered with a Board School, a coffee palace, houses, and shops,\r\nincluding the Bunhill Fields Memorial Buildings, erected in 1881.[5]\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  Although 12,000 Quakers were buried in the Coleman Street ground,\r\n  including Edward Burrough and others who died as martyrs in Newgate\r\n  Gaol, George Fox’s grave was the only one marked by a stone,—a small\r\n  tablet on the wall, with the simple inscription, “G. F.” This\r\n  attracted visits from country Friends in such numbers that a zealous\r\n  member of the Society named Robert Howard “pronounced it ‘Nehushtan,’”\r\n  and caused it to be destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the Friends’ burial-grounds are intact. The one in\r\nBaker’s Row, Whitechapel (acquired in 1687 and used by the Devonshire\r\nHouse Division), is now a recreation ground; and the one in Long Lane,\r\nBermondsey, which was bought in 1697 for £120, has lately been laid out\r\nfor the use of the public. In addition to these there are, in London\r\nitself, five little grounds adjoining meeting-houses in High Street,\r\nDeptford, in Brook Street, Ratcliff, in High Street, Wandsworth (given\r\nby Joan Stringer in 1697), by the Creek, Hammersmith, and in Hanover\r\nStreet, Peckham Rye. The Society acquired the Ratcliff ground in 1666 or\r\n1667, the land being originally copyhold, but enfranchised in 1734 for\r\n£21. All these grounds are neatly kept; the one in Peckham, which dates\r\nfrom 1821, is beautiful, and illustrates what can be done with a disused\r\nand closed graveyard, not even visible from the road, when it is treated\r\nwith proper care and respect. Many of the burial-grounds just outside\r\nLondon have been sold with the meeting-houses.\r\n\r\nThere are not many Roman Catholic burial-grounds in London apart from\r\nthose attached to conventual establishments. St. Mary’s Church,\r\nMoorfields, has a very small churchyard and had two additional grounds,\r\none in Bethnal Green which has disappeared, and one in Wades Place,\r\nPoplar, now used as a school playground. This is the case also with a\r\nRoman Catholic burial-ground in Duncan Terrace, Islington, which has\r\nbeen asphalted for the use of the boys’ school, some tombstones and a\r\nfigure of the Virgin Mary being in an enclosure on the north side. There\r\nis a very large ground dedicated to All Souls, by St. Mary’s Church,\r\nCadogan Terrace, Chelsea, and a small one by the church in Parker’s Row,\r\nDockhead, S.E., the garden here, which is now a recreation ground for\r\nthe schools or the sisters, having also been used for burials. There is\r\none in Woolwich, lately encroached upon through the enlargement of the\r\nschool, where three lonely-looking graves are in a railed-in enclosure\r\nin the middle of a tar-paved yard; and there is also the ground behind\r\nSt. Thomas’s, Fulham, which is still in use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRIENDS’ BURIAL-GROUND IN WHITECHAPEL.]\r\n\r\nBut the burial-grounds adjoining Baptist, Wesleyan, Independent, and\r\nother Chapels, what shall be said of them? They have suffered terribly\r\nin the slaughter, and although many still exist, a very large number\r\nhave entirely disappeared. Only three are open as public gardens—the\r\nWesleyan ground in Cable Street, St. George’s in the East, which was\r\nadded to St. George’s churchyard garden in 1875; the ground behind the\r\nIndependent Chapel by St. Thomas’ Square, Hackney; and the burial-ground\r\nadjoining Whitfield’s Tabernacle, Tottenham Court Road, the subject of\r\nmuch litigation, which was opened in February, 1895, by the London\r\nCounty Council. The original chapel on this site was founded by George\r\nWhitefield in 1756, amongst his supporters being the Countess of\r\nHuntingdon, David Garrick, and Benjamin Franklin. One other graveyard\r\nwas laid out as a garden, that adjoining Trinity Chapel, East India Dock\r\nRoad, but it is now closed, no one at present undertaking its\r\nmaintenance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHITFIELD’S TABERNACLE.]\r\n\r\nFor the rest of the grounds, not only Methodist but also\r\nCongregationalist and above all Baptist, we must employ the “diligent\r\nsearch in dirty corners,” but all the seeking in the world will not\r\nrestore those that are gone—sold and built upon. The fates of some of\r\nthem are recorded in Appendix B. The parishes south of the river seem to\r\nhave been great strongholds of dissent. Woolwich, Deptford, Walworth,\r\nand Wandsworth are still full of chapels, many of which have\r\nburial-grounds attached. North of the Thames perhaps Hackney is richest\r\nin chapels and chapel graveyards, including the Unitarian in Chatham\r\nPlace. Whitechapel also had a great many. But in the Borough and other\r\nparts of Southwark the little meeting-houses swarmed at one time, some\r\nof which, with their little burial-grounds, still exist. A few of the\r\nchapels now belong to the Salvation Army; one in York Street, Walworth,\r\nhas lately been acquired as the Robert Browning Hall, and its\r\nburial-ground is to be a public garden; others in Peckham, Woolwich, and\r\nHammersmith have been converted into schools (the two last named being\r\nboard schools), their graveyards being the playgrounds; and many more\r\nhave fallen from their first estate.\r\n\r\nIt might be instructive to those who are not well acquainted with South\r\nLondon to take a walk, in imagination, through Long Lane. It begins at\r\nSt. George the Martyr, Borough, of “Little Dorrit” fame, where the\r\nchurchyard is a public garden. Close by this, also on the north side of\r\nthe lane, there used to be a Baptist Chapel in Sheer’s Alley, with a\r\nburial-ground. Wilmott’s Buildings occupy the site. Very little beyond\r\nis Collier’s Rents. Here is a chapel which used to belong to the\r\nBaptists, but is now in the hands of the Congregational Union. Its\r\ndreary little graveyard is on the north side, behind a high wall. A\r\nlittle further on, and opposite, is Southwark Chapel (Wesleyan), built\r\nin 1808. It also has a graveyard, where the chief ornament is a hen-coop\r\namongst the tumbling tombstones. A short turning to the north, Nelson\r\nStreet, takes us to the disused burial-ground of Guy’s Hospital; and\r\nbefore we come to the end of the lane there are three more grounds to be\r\nseen, that belonging to the Society of Friends, already mentioned in\r\nthis Chapter, and one that adjoins it and is owned by the trustees of a\r\nneighbouring Baptist Chapel, which is very small and has a minister’s\r\nvault in the middle. This ground originally belonged to the Independents\r\nof Beck Street, and its appellation when closed was the Neckinger Road\r\nChapel burial-ground. Lastly we come to St. Mary Magdalene’s, the parish\r\nchurch of Bermondsey, with a charming churchyard garden which includes a\r\nportion of the cemetery of Bermondsey Abbey. And yet Long Lane is only\r\nabout half a mile in length!\r\n\r\nIt is a little curious to notice that in the next parish, Rotherhithe,\r\nthere are no less than five churchyards, but not a single burial-ground\r\nbelonging to the Dissenters.\r\n\r\nWhen visiting the burial-grounds for the London County Council, I was\r\nmuch struck with three that seemed particularly neglected and untidy.\r\nThese were the Baptist ground in Mare Street, Hackney, which was being\r\nused for the storage of old wood, furniture, and flower-pots; the ground\r\nbehind the pretentious Congregational Chapel on Stockwell Green, where\r\nall kinds of dirty rubbish, paper, iron-building materials, the broken\r\ntop of a lamp-post, &c., were lying about amongst the sinking graves;\r\nand a little ground in Church Street, Deptford, behind a chapel which\r\nbelongs to a General Baptist (Unitarian) connection, whose creed I do\r\nnot pretend to understand, but whose railings were so broken that a far\r\nlarger visitor than I could have followed me through the gaps to behold\r\nbroken tombstones, collections of unsavoury rubbish, and another\r\nspecimen of the worn-out top of a lamp-post. There were many other very\r\nuntidy grounds, such as those by the Wesleyan Chapel in Liverpool Road,\r\nKing’s Cross, and the Congregational Chapel in Esher Street, Lambeth;\r\nbut I think the three I have mentioned above would have been—in the\r\nSpring of 1895, at any rate—awarded the first, second, and third prizes\r\nin a competition for neglect; and in January, 1896, I find these grounds\r\nare in much the same condition as they were then.\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to turn to some of the chapel grounds which are well\r\nkept. The one which adjoins the Congregational Church in High Street,\r\nDeptford, is generally neat; so is the graveyard of the City Road\r\nChapel, at any rate at its western end, where John Wesley’s monument\r\nstands; and the same may be said of the portions that are left of the\r\ngrounds adjoining Union Chapel, Streatham Hill, and the New West End\r\nBaptist Chapel in King Street, Hammersmith.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WESLEY’S MONUMENT IN THE GRAVEYARD OF THE CITY ROAD\r\nCHAPEL.]\r\n\r\nThere was a large burial-ground behind a chapel in Cannon Street Road,\r\nE. The building passed into the hands of the Rector of St. George’s in\r\nthe East, but was afterwards pulled down, and one of Raine’s Foundation\r\nSchools was subsequently erected on its site. The burial-ground, in\r\nwhich many Lascars[6] were interred, is now in three parts. One is a\r\nsmall playground for the school, the largest part is Messrs. Seaward\r\nBrothers’ yard for their carts, and the third piece is a cooper’s yard\r\nbelonging to Messrs. Hasted and Sons. A similar kind of chapel in\r\nPenrose Street, Walworth, known for a time as St. John’s Episcopal\r\nChapel, is now the studio of a scenic artist, while the large\r\nburial-ground in the rear is the depôt of the Newington Vestry, and is\r\nfull of carts, manure, gravel, dust, stones, &c.\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  These Lascars used to live in a court near by, and are said to have\r\n  been locked in at night.\r\n\r\nThe East London Railway has swallowed up the graveyards by Rose Lane\r\nChapel, Stepney, and the Sabbatarian or Seventh Day Baptists’ Chapel in\r\nMill Yard, by Leman Street; the Medical School of Guy’s Hospital is on\r\nthe Mazepond Baptist Chapel-ground; the site of one which adjoined the\r\nLondon Road Chapel, S.E., is now occupied by a tailor’s shop, the next\r\nhouse being on the space where the chapel stood, and these two shops are\r\neasily picked out in the row as they are higher and newer than their\r\nneighbours on either side. A little Baptist graveyard in Dipping Alley,\r\nHorselydown, which had a baptistery in it, disappeared very many years\r\nago; the site of the Baptist Chapel and burial-ground in Worship Street,\r\nShoreditch, forms a part of the yard used as the goods depôt of the\r\nLondon and North Western Railway; a similar one in Broad Street,\r\nWapping, is now, I believe, a milkman’s yard, and was for many years\r\npreviously the parish stoneyard; while the very crowded ground which\r\nused to be behind Buckingham Chapel, Palace Street, has a brewery on it.\r\nThere is a little graveyard in front of Maberley Chapel, Ball’s Pond\r\n(now called Earlham Hall), but the three tombstones that are left in it\r\nare not only put upon the north wall of the chapel, but have actually\r\nbeen painted with the wall.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned that a few of the chapels have been replaced by\r\nschools, but I ought also to mention that the graveyards behind Abney\r\nChapel, Stoke Newington, N., Denmark Row Chapel, Coldharbour Lane, S.E.,\r\nand the chapel in Hanbury Street, Mile End New Town, E., were only\r\nclosed for a very few years before school buildings were erected on\r\nthem. A small yard remains of the last named, but practically nothing is\r\nleft of the others. The site of the graveyard in the rear of the chapel\r\nin Gloucester Street, Shoreditch, has, together with that of the chapel\r\nitself, been merged into the premises of the Gaslight and Coke Company.\r\n\r\nThese are specimens of the uses to which the Dissenters’ grounds have\r\nbeen put, and which we want to prevent in the future, for I hope that it\r\nmay not be long before many of those that have not been entirely lost\r\nare “converted” into cheerful resting-places for the use of the living.\r\n\r\nIt is the question of their maintenance, when they are once laid out,\r\nthat has hitherto caused so much difficulty, and this not only with the\r\nDissenters’ grounds, but also with the churchyards. Where the Vestry or\r\nDistrict Board of Works will undertake to maintain a ground under the\r\nOpen Spaces Acts it is simple enough, and in many cases this has been\r\ndone most effectually. But some of these bodies will not accept the\r\nresponsibility. The Corporation keeps up St. Paul’s Churchyard and\r\nBunhill Fields, and the London County Council maintains Whitfield’s\r\nTabernacle ground and ten graveyards which were laid out by the\r\nMetropolitan Public Gardens Association. It was with great difficulty\r\nand after a hard fight that the Earl of Meath managed to induce the\r\nCouncil to take over some of these grounds (and this only year by year),\r\ntogether with several squares and playgrounds, the maintenance of which\r\nwas too heavy a burden upon the funds of a voluntary society. Of late\r\nyears the Association has not laid out any burial-ground until its\r\nfuture maintenance is legally secured. A short time ago, soon after the\r\npublication of the return prepared by me for the Council, the Parks and\r\nOpen Spaces Committee recommended that a conference should be held to\r\nconsider some general scheme for the treatment of the burial-grounds\r\nwhich are still closed, their acquisition for the use of the public, and\r\ntheir maintenance, it being felt somewhat unjust that while some of the\r\nMetropolitan vestries and boards (such as St. Pancras and Hackney) were\r\nannually expending considerable sums in the upkeep of graveyard gardens,\r\nothers (such as Rotherhithe and Limehouse) declined to do so. But the\r\nrecommendation, when it came before the general meeting of the Council,\r\nwas withdrawn for the time being, and the whole question remains in\r\n_statu quo ante_.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n               THE BURIAL-PLACES OF FOREIGNERS IN LONDON.\r\n\r\n              “The very names recorded here are strange,\r\n                Of foreign accent, and of different climes;\r\n              Alvares and Revira interchange\r\n                With Abraham and Jacob of old times.”\r\n                                         LONGFELLOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT is only natural that in London, to which so many from other countries\r\nhave fled, and where so many foreigners have lived, worked, and died,\r\nthere should be evidences left of their places of interment. Solitary\r\ncases of their burial among Englishmen are, of course, to be met with\r\neverywhere, and there are many such in the London graveyards. In\r\nRotherhithe Churchyard is a well-known tombstone erected to the memory\r\nof Prince Lee-boo of the Pelew Islands, who died in 1784; in St. Ann’s,\r\nSoho, there is a tablet to that of Theodore, the last King of Corsica;\r\nthere is the grave of an Indian chief in the burial-ground of St.\r\nJohn’s, Westminster, in Horseferry Road; and it is said that the first\r\nperson interred in a part of Bishopsgate Churchyard was a Frenchman\r\nnamed Martin de la Tour, while this ground also used to contain a very\r\nold altar tomb with a Persian inscription round it to the memory of Coya\r\nShawsware, a Persian merchant, who died in 1626. The edition of Stow’s\r\n“Survey,” published in 1633, contains a picture of this monument and an\r\naccount of the funeral ceremonies which took place at the grave.\r\nMaitland also refers to it, but gives a totally different first name to\r\nthe merchant. It is evident that for some time after his burial his son\r\nand other friends used to gather at the grave twice a day for prayer and\r\nfuneral devotions, until driven away by the ridicule of the populace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JEWISH CEMETERY, MILE END.]\r\n\r\nBut there have been in London many special burial-grounds belonging to\r\nspecial groups of foreigners, and several of them remain. Foremost among\r\nthese are the Jewish cemeteries.\r\n\r\nUntil the year 1177, the time of Henry II., the Jews in England were\r\nonly allowed one burial-place. It was known as the Jews’ Garden and was\r\noutside the wall of London by Cripplegate, several acres being devoted\r\nto the purpose—a neighbourhood subsequently known by the name of\r\nLeyrestowe. When other burial-places were permitted, this ground was\r\nbuilt upon, but the remembrance of it still lives in the name of one\r\nstreet in the district, Jewin Street, reminding us of the time of the\r\nbitter persecutions which the Jews suffered, and which are chronicled,\r\nto our shame, in English history.\r\n\r\n         “Pride and humiliation hand in hand\r\n           Walked with them thro’ the world where’er they went;\r\n         Trampled and beaten were they as the sand,\r\n           And yet unshaken as the continent.”\r\n\r\nIn the first place it is to be noticed that the Jews, as a race, are\r\nparticularly pledged to preserve their burial-places. This is not a law\r\namong them—so I have been told by the Chief Rabbi—but a binding\r\nobligation handed down from the most ancient times, and any disturbance\r\nof the burial-grounds which now exist is not permitted. No doubt it was\r\ntotally beyond their power to prevent the “Jews’ Garden” from being\r\ncovered with streets, its very size and position rendered it practically\r\nimpossible to preserve, and it was probably annihilated during one of\r\nthose periods when the Jews were expelled from England. Another\r\nexception which proves the rule is at Oxford, where the Botanic Garden,\r\nwhich dates from 1622, was made on the site of the Jewish burial-ground.\r\n\r\nThey also strictly observed the sanitary laws respecting burial laid\r\ndown for them, and their cemeteries have not been overcrowded. Burial is\r\nonly allowed at 6 feet from the surface of the ground, and only one body\r\nis in each grave, one coffin not being placed above another; and this\r\nrule has been carried out in the Jewish burial-grounds in London—again\r\nwith one exception.\r\n\r\nIn the very large, old graveyard in Brady Street, Bethnal Green\r\n(formerly called North Street), there are walls running through it, and\r\nthe southern half is higher than the northern half, having quite a hilly\r\nappearance. The following is the explanation. This half of the ground\r\nwas originally allotted to “strangers,” Jews who belonged to no special\r\ncongregation. About thirty years after it was full, a layer of earth, 4\r\nfeet in depth, was added to the ground, and it was used over again. As\r\nthe coffins were again placed 6 feet from the surface, there still\r\nremained 4 feet of earth between them and the old ones beneath. As a\r\nresult of this curious and interesting arrangement, there may be seen,\r\nin several cases, two gravestones standing up back to back, which\r\nrepresent the two graves below them. Here lie buried, with other members\r\nof the family, Nathan Mayer de Rothschild, the founder of the English\r\nhouse of Rothschild, Asher and Benjamin Goldsmid, and many another Jew\r\nfamous on ’Change.\r\n\r\nWithin the Metropolitan area there are at present nine Jewish\r\ngraveyards; there are others more lately acquired, and all still in use,\r\nat Willesden, West Ham, Edmonton, Plashet, and Golders Green, Hendon,\r\nThe disused grounds which belong to the United Synagogue are those in\r\nBrady Street, Bethnal Green, E., Hoxton Street, N., Alderney Road, Mile\r\nEnd, E., and Grove Street, Hackney, E., and I cannot, unfortunately,\r\ncall them well kept, but the neatest is the one in Alderney Road. In all\r\nof them the tombstones are upright, rather above the average size, and\r\nwith inscriptions upon them which are almost invariably in Hebrew. The\r\none in Hoxton is very small. It was originally formed for the use of the\r\nHamborough Synagogue, Fenchurch Street, and was first used about the\r\nyear 1700. All these grounds are old, part of the one in Alderney Road\r\ndates from about 1700, while the Brady Street Cemetery was formed in\r\n1795. Many of the tombstones have at the top a representation of two\r\noutstretched hands with the thumbs joining, the symbol of descendants of\r\nAaron, the High Priest. Others have a hand pouring water out of a\r\nflagon, and they are over the graves of the Levites whose duty in the\r\nsynagogue is to pour water upon the hands of the Priests (the\r\nabove-mentioned descendants of Aaron), who are nearly all named Cohen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JEWISH CEMETERY IN FULHAM ROAD.]\r\n\r\nIn Ball’s Pond, Islington, is the small cemetery of the West London\r\nCongregation of British Jews, which is still in use. Here some very\r\nlarge and extravagant tombstones may be seen, and the ground is very\r\nneatly kept. In Fulham Road (Queen’s Elm) is a dreary little ground\r\nbelonging to the synagogue in St. Alban’s Place, S.W. I believe an\r\noccasional interment takes place here in reserve plots, but the\r\ncongregation has provided itself with another cemetery at Edmonton. I am\r\nindebted to the kindness of Mr. R. Proctor for the photograph of this\r\ngraveyard. Some few years back, before the Disused Burial-grounds Act\r\nwas in force, a row of shops was built on the west frontage of the\r\nground, the one body lying in that part being removed to another place.\r\nNo doubt the freehold worth of the land was considerable at that time,\r\nand therefore the congregation disregarded their scruples concerning\r\nthis one deceased member. The graveyard can only be visited between\r\ncertain hours on Sundays, but the rest of the Jewish cemeteries have\r\nresident caretakers. In Bancroft Road, Mile End, is another dreary\r\nplace, which, although in so crowded a district, is still in use. When\r\nlast I visited it I was told there was room for about four more graves!\r\nIt belongs to the Maiden Lane Synagogue. None of these grounds, except\r\nthat at Ball’s Pond, have proper paths in them; they have been entirely\r\nfilled with graves, between which a few narrow lines like sheep-tracks\r\nwind about the grass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JEWISH BURIAL-GROUND BEHIND THE BETH HOLIM HOSPITAL, MILE\r\nEND.]\r\n\r\nLastly, there are the cemeteries of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews—one,\r\nclosed for burials, behind the Beth Holim Hospital in Mile End Road, and\r\none, nearly five acres in extent and still in use, just beyond the\r\nPeople’s Palace. These are neatly kept, the former, or at any rate a\r\npart of it, being actually turned into a sort of garden for the patients\r\nin the hospital, with trees in it, paths and seats. The latter is bare\r\nof trees or shrubs, but is divided into plots, with paths between. In\r\nboth of them the tombstones, unlike those in the other Jewish grounds,\r\nare flat, either slabs on the ground or low altar tombs; and in the\r\nlarge ground there are many children’s graves, marked by much smaller\r\naltar tombs dotted amongst the large ones, which are very unique and\r\ninteresting. The Hebrew inscription at the entrance tells us that this\r\nis “The House of the Living,”—“Beth Hayim.” The cemetery was acquired in\r\n1657, and contains the remains of the ancestors of Lord Beaconsfield,\r\nthe Eardley family, Sampson Gideon, the Samudas, D’Aguilars, Ricardos,\r\nLopes, and many others who trace their descent from Sephardi Jews.\r\n\r\nHitherto it has not been possible to secure any of the Jewish graveyards\r\nas public gardens, the feeling of the community is against it, but the\r\nday may yet come when the Council of the United Synagogue will allow the\r\nexperiment to be tried.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JEWISH CEMETERY, MILE END.]\r\n\r\nThe burial-ground of the Greeks in London is an enclosure in Norwood\r\nCemetery, where some elaborate monuments may be seen. The Mohammedans\r\ncan practise their rites at Woking.\r\n\r\nThere is no special place at the present time, I believe, where Danes\r\nand Swedes are buried, but their churches, with surrounding graveyards,\r\nwere situated close together, in Wellclose and Prince’s Square, E. The\r\nchurch in Prince’s Square is still the Swedish church of London\r\n(Eleanora), and there is a notice at the corner of a turning on the\r\nsouth side of Cable Street, St. George’s in the East,—“Till Svenska\r\nKyrkan.” Here, in a vault, are the remains of Emmanuel Swedenborg\r\nhimself, while the garden contains many tombstones, especially an inner\r\nenclosure which was filled first. But the building now situated in\r\nWellclose Square is no longer the Danish or Mariner’s Church, the site\r\nis occupied by schools and mission buildings in connection with St.\r\nPaul’s, Dock Street, the present seaman’s church. Nor are there any\r\ntombstones in the garden, although it is certain that many Danes and\r\nmany sailors were buried under the church, and in a surrounding\r\ngraveyard, which was probably an inner enclosure like that in Prince’s\r\nSquare. Mention of it is made by Northook in 1773, and by Malcolm in\r\n1803; and there is a picture of the church in Maitland’s “History of\r\nLondon.” The following account from the “Beauties of London and\r\nMiddlesex (1815)” is also of interest:—“At the extremity of this parish\r\nis Wellclose Square, which has also borne the name of Marine Square,\r\nfrom the number of sea officers who used to reside in it. It is a pretty\r\nlittle neat square; but its principal ornament is the Danish church in\r\nthe centre, in the midst of its churchyard, planted with trees.... This\r\nstructure was erected in 1696, at the expense of Christian V., King of\r\nDenmark, as appears by the inscription: ‘Templem Dano Norwegicum\r\nintercessione et munificentia serenissimi Danorum Regis Christiani\r\nQuinti erectum MDCXCVI.’ Gaius Gabriel Cibber was the architect, who\r\nerected a monument within this church to the memory of his wife Jane,\r\ndaughter of William Colley, Esq., and mother of Colley Cibber, the\r\nfamous dramatist. The architect himself is also buried here.” The\r\nFlemish burial-ground was in the district of St. Olave’s, Southwark. It\r\nadjoined a chapel in Carter Lane, and before its demolition was used as\r\nan additional graveyard by the parishes of St. Olave and St. John,\r\nespecially the former. When the railway to Greenwich was made this\r\nground disappeared, and part of its site forms the approach to London\r\nBridge Station.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A South View of QUEEN ELIZABETH’S FREE GRAMMAR SCHOOL\r\nin Tooley Street in the Parish of St. Olave, Southwark,\r\n_with a Plan of the adjacent Neighbourhood_\r\n\r\nTHE FLEMISH BURIAL-GROUND, CARTER LANE, ABOUT 1817.]\r\n\r\nIn Milman’s Row, Chelsea, there is a quaint and curious burial-ground\r\nbelonging to the Moravians. The adjoining buildings have passed out of\r\ntheir hands, their present chapel being in Fetter Lane, E.C. In 1750\r\nCount Zinzendorf purchased two acres of land (a part of the garden and\r\nstables of Beaufort House) of Sir Hans Sloane, about one acre of which\r\nwas set aside for burials, and divided into four parts—the first for\r\nmale infants and single brothers, the second for female infants and\r\nsingle sisters, the third for married brothers and widowers, and the\r\nfourth for married sisters and widows. The stones are flat on the grass\r\nand very small, not more than about 11 or 15 inches by 10 or 12 inches\r\nin size, and the ground was closed for interments about the year 1888.\r\n\r\nThere is no purely Dutch place of interment in London now. Besides the\r\nDutch Church in Austin Friars (the survival of the priory of the\r\nAugustine Friars), which has lost its churchyard, they used to have a\r\nfew chapels which seemed to change hands, sometimes belonging to Dutch\r\nand at other times to German congregations. Such was Zoar chapel, in\r\nGreat Alie Street, Whitechapel, which is now a Baptist conventicle. It\r\nhad a fair-sized burial-ground behind it at the beginning of the\r\ncentury, the site of which is covered by houses and a forge. One day\r\nrecently I knocked at the door of this chapel, hoping to be allowed to\r\nlook round it, in order to make sure that no part of the yard was left.\r\nThe woman who opened it, when I politely asked if I might go in, said\r\n“No!” and slammed the door again at once. One meets with varied\r\nreceptions in different places, Two German churches, with graveyards\r\nattached, were also in this neighbourhood—the Lutheran (St. George’s),\r\nin Little Alie Street, and the Protestant Reformed Church, in Hooper\r\nSquare. The latter has entirely disappeared, the railway covering its\r\nsite. The former church still exists, with the little yard behind it,\r\nseparated by a wall from the adjoining schoolyard, but the entrance from\r\nLittle Alie Street has been bricked up.\r\n\r\nThe precinct of the Savoy had a distinctly foreign flavour about it, but\r\nthe Savoy Chapel itself is now the only remnant left of the large group\r\nof buildings which were used at different times as palace, hospital,\r\nbarracks, and prison, and finally demolished in 1877. The churchyard is\r\nprobably even older than the church. It is now a neat little garden, in\r\nthe possession of Her Majesty the Queen, as Duchess of Lancaster, and\r\nlaid out, chiefly at her cost, for the use of the public. This is the\r\nburial-ground described by Dickens, in _All the Year Round_, with some\r\nof his tenderest touches, and of which he says: “I think that on summer\r\nnights the dew falls here—the only dew that is shed in all London,\r\nbeyond the tears of the homeless.” But the Savoy used to contain one, if\r\nnot two, German chapels, besides a French Jesuit chapel and a\r\nmeeting-place for Persian worship. The German church (wrongly called\r\nDutch on Rocque’s plan) had a burial-ground on its west side, which is\r\nmarked on the ordnance maps, except the very latest, as it survived\r\nuntil 1876, when the human remains were removed to a cemetery at Colney\r\nHatch. Now its site is covered by part of the new block of buildings\r\nwhich include the Savoy Chambers and the Medical Examination Hall. The\r\nRev. W. Loftie’s book, “Memorials of the Savoy,” gives a full and\r\ninteresting history of the Precinct, and is, as is usual with his works,\r\ncompiled with care and truthfulness; but beyond simply mentioning the\r\nexistence of the German burial-ground he has nothing to tell of it. We\r\nshould have liked to know what the gravestones were like, and whether\r\nany persons of distinction were interred there.\r\n\r\nWe now turn to the French in London, and these have to be divided into\r\nthe Roman Catholics and the Huguenots. No doubt Frenchmen and\r\nFrenchwomen have been laid to rest in the burial-grounds attached to all\r\nthe Roman Catholic churches, and especially in All Souls Cemetery,\r\nbehind the chapel of St. Mary, in Cadogan Place, Chelsea, which chapel\r\nwas built by M. Voyaux de Franous, a French _Émigré_ clergyman, and\r\nconsecrated in 1811. Large numbers were also interred at St. Pancras,\r\nthe eastern end of the old churchyard receiving, in consequence, the\r\nname of “Catholic Pancras.” But this is the part which has been so much\r\ndisturbed and appropriated by the Midland Railway Company, and what\r\nremains of it is some dreary, dark slips under the railway arches, and\r\ngroups and hillocks of tombstones which were moved into the western part\r\nof the ground, where, amongst other illustrious graves, are those of Dr.\r\nWalker, of dictionary fame, Mary Woolstoncraft Godwin, and William\r\nWoollett, the engraver.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EAST HILL BURIAL-GROUND, WANDSWORTH.]\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1687 between thirteen and fourteen thousand French\r\nProtestants, driven from home by the intolerance of Louis XIV., settled\r\nin London, some in Spitalfields, others in the district of St. Giles’\r\nand Seven Dials, in Stepney, and in Wandsworth. There was a French\r\nchurch at Wandsworth, which subsequently fell into the hands of the\r\nWesleyans, and the Huguenots who settled in this locality were chiefly\r\nengaged in trade as hatters. As a result of these settlements we find\r\ntheir graves in Bethnal Green Churchyard and other places, but\r\nespecially in the East Hill burial-ground at Wandsworth, where many\r\nFrench Protestants of note were interred, and where there are some fine\r\nold headstones and altar tombs. It is a picturesque ground between the\r\ntwo roads, but, with the exception of a pathway through it, it is not\r\nopen to the public.\r\n\r\nForeigners now have to be buried in the cemeteries, and many a strange\r\nservice or ceremony has been held at the graveside of those who belong\r\nto other climes, especially, perhaps, in Kensal Green Cemetery, Norwood\r\nCemetery, and the others that are non-parochial. The Jews and the Greeks\r\nare, I believe, the only communities of strangers who still keep up\r\nseparate burial-grounds of their own in London.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n              HOSPITAL, ALMSHOUSE, AND WORKHOUSE GROUNDS.\r\n\r\n                    “Such ebb and flow must ever be,\r\n                    Then wherefore should we mourn?”\r\n                                          WORDSWORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN the Greyfriars, or Christ’s Hospital, was set aside for “poor\r\nchildren,” and Bridewell for “the correction of vagabonds,” St.\r\nBartholomew’s Hospital in the City and St. Thomas’s in Southwark were\r\ndevoted to the care of the “wounded, maimed, sick, and diseased”; and in\r\nthese four benevolent institutions, which owe so much to the short-lived\r\nbut truly pious King Edward VI., there was provision made for the burial\r\nof the dead. It must be remembered that the quadrangle of Christ’s\r\nHospital, which is still surrounded by cloisters, was the burial-ground\r\nof the Greyfriars, but apart from this, for the boys of the school or\r\nthe officers or servants, there was a small plot of ground set apart as\r\na graveyard at the north-west corner of the block of buildings. This was\r\ndemolished when the great hall was built, in 1825, and if any of its\r\nsite remains it is only a limited piece of the courtyard on the north\r\nside of the hall and the doctor’s garden. A few tombstones are preserved\r\nin the passage leading to the doctor’s house. At this time was formed\r\nthe additional burial-ground for Christ Church at the western end of the\r\nchurchyard of St. Botolph, Aldersgate Street. But the churchyard\r\nadjoining Christ Church, and even the cloisters themselves, were used\r\nfrom time to time by the Hospital, and it was the custom in the last\r\ncentury for a “blue” to be buried by torchlight. His schoolfellows\r\npassed through the venerable courtyards and buildings in procession, two\r\nby two, and sang a burial anthem from the 39th Psalm, which must have\r\nbeen a most solemn and touching sight, and was “particularly adapted to\r\nthe monastic territory” of the Hospital. It will be a sad day when this\r\nnoble old school is torn from its rightful home in the City of London,\r\nand when the boys receive a “modern” education in a trim, new building,\r\nand wear the dull tweed suit and the school cap dragged on at the back\r\nof their heads; and it is well to impress again and again upon the\r\nCharity Commissioners and the Almoners of the Hospital that a very\r\nconsiderable portion of the site will not be available for building\r\nupon, as it will come under the provisions of the Disused Burial-grounds\r\nAct. The same remark applies with even greater force to the neighbouring\r\nhospital, the Charterhouse, where all the gardens and courtyards,\r\nincluding the Square itself and the little burial-ground which is still\r\nrecognisable as such, have been used at one time or another for\r\ninterments. I have explained how this came about in a former chapter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CORNER OF CHRIST’S HOSPITAL, THE GREYFRIARS’\r\nCLOISTERS.]\r\n\r\nI think it probable that when St. Bartholomew’s Hospital was far smaller\r\nthan it is now, burials took place in the cloisters, or rather in the\r\nlarge space in the middle of which the western wing was built. In a very\r\ninteresting old plan of the precincts, dated 1617, there is not only\r\nshown the “Church-yarde for ye poore” in two pieces, about where the\r\nwest wing is now, but also a large ground which is named Christ Church\r\nChurchyard, to the south of this, but north of the City wall. The\r\nhospital later on used the Bethlem burial-ground, and the ground set\r\naside eventually as the hospital graveyard (for the interment of\r\nunclaimed corpses), is in Seward Street, Goswell Road. This was first\r\nused about 1740, and, after being closed for burials, it was let as a\r\ncarter’s yard and was full of sheds and vans. Through the kindness of\r\nthe Governors, it fell into the hands of the Metropolitan Public Gardens\r\nAssociation, and it is now a children’s recreation ground maintained by\r\nSt. Luke’s Vestry. The burial-ground of St. Thomas’s Hospital is at the\r\ncorner of Mazepond; on part of it St. Olave’s Rectory and Messrs.\r\nBevington’s leather warehouse were built; the remainder is leased to\r\nGuy’s Hospital, and contains the treasurer’s stables and an asphalted\r\ntennis-court for the use of the students. Guy’s Hospital burial-ground\r\nis in Snow’s Fields, Bermondsey, and is now a large builder’s yard, but\r\nthere is a reasonable hope of its being secured before long as a\r\nrecreation ground. The “unclaimed corpses” from the London Hospital\r\nfound their last resting-place very near home. In 1849 the whole of the\r\nsouthern part of the enclosure, quite an acre and a half, was the\r\nburial-ground, and here, although it was closed by order in Council in\r\n1854, it appears that burials took place until about 1860, one of the\r\npresent porters remembering his father acting as gravedigger. The\r\nmedical school, the chaplain’s house, and the nurse’s home have all been\r\nbuilt upon it, and it is sincerely to be hoped that no further\r\nencroachments will be permitted. The remaining part is the nurses’ and\r\nstudents’ garden and tennis-court, where they are in the habit of\r\ncapering about in their short times off duty, and where it sometimes\r\nhappens that the grass gives way beneath them—an ordinary occurrence\r\nwhen the subsoil is inhabited by coffins!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LONDON HOSPITAL BURIAL-GROUND.]\r\n\r\nBridewell also had its burial-ground, where the lazy and evil were\r\ninterred. It is at the corner of Dorset and Tudor Streets, near the\r\nThames Embankment, and is an untidy yard, boarded off from the street\r\nwith a high advertisement hoarding, and in the occupation of a builder.\r\n\r\nThe Bethlem burial-ground had a more interesting history. In 1569 Sir\r\nThomas Roe, or Rowe, Merchant Taylor and Mayor, gave about one acre of\r\nland in the Moorfields “for Burial Ease to such parishes in London as\r\nwanted convenient ground.” It was especially intended for the parish of\r\nSt. Botolph’s, Bishopsgate, and was probably used for the interment of\r\nlunatics from the neighbouring asylum, besides being used by St.\r\nBartholomew’s Hospital. It was enclosed with a brick wall at the\r\npersuasion of “the Lady his Wife,” and she was buried there; and it was\r\nthe custom upon Whit Sunday for the Lord Mayor and Aldermen to listen to\r\na sermon delivered in this “new churchyard, near Bethlem.” We read that\r\nin 1584 “a very good Sermon was preached ... and, by Reason no Plays\r\nwere the Same Day (_i.e._, Whit Sunday, as there used to be), all the\r\nCity was quiet.” But the Churchyard and the Asylum have disappeared,\r\nLiverpool Street Station having taken their place, and hundreds of the\r\nGreat Eastern Railway goods vans daily roll over the mouldering remains\r\nof the departed citizens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHELSEA HOSPITAL GRAVEYARD.]\r\n\r\nVery different to the fate of these hospital burial-grounds is that of\r\nanother one I will mention. Facing Queen’s Road, Chelsea, is the long,\r\nnarrow graveyard of the Chelsea Hospital. It is neatly kept, with good\r\ngrass and trees. Here many a venerable pensioner has been laid to rest,\r\nand, although it can no longer be used for burials, it still serves to\r\nremind the living of their brethren who have gone before them. There are\r\nsome fine monuments and epitaphs to very long-lived invalids, two aged\r\n112, one 111, one 107, and so on, and it is one of those quiet and\r\nquaint corners of London which form so marked a contrast to the noisy\r\nstreets close by. One pensioner, who died in 1732, named William Hiseman\r\nand aged 112, was “a veteran, if ever soldier was.” It is recorded that\r\nhe took unto himself a wife when he was above 100 years old. There is\r\nsomething very peaceful about these old men’s graves; the grain gathered\r\nin by the “Reaper whose name is Death” was fully ripe:—\r\n\r\n                  “It is not quiet, is not ease,\r\n                   But something deeper far than these;\r\n                   The separation that is here\r\n                   Is of the grave; and of austere\r\n                   Yet happy feelings of the dead.”\r\n\r\nOn the south side of the Thames there are some other burial-grounds\r\nwhich should be mentioned here. Greenwich Hospital possesses no less\r\nthan three cemeteries. In 1707 Prince George of Denmark gave a plot of\r\nground for the purpose, measuring 660 by 132 feet. This is on the west\r\nside of the Royal Naval School. It is enclosed and full of tombstones.\r\nBut in 1747 an extra two and a half acres, surrounding the old ground,\r\nwere appropriated for interments. This space is well kept, containing\r\nsome fine trees and only a few monuments. The gate from the school\r\nplayground is generally open. Then there is the Hospital Cemetery in\r\nWest Combe, nearly six acres in size, and first used in 1857. The\r\nburial-ground of God’s Gift College (Dulwich) is at the corner of Court\r\nLane. It dates from about 1700, and is a picturesque, well-kept little\r\nground, with several handsome altar tombs in it. The cemetery of Morden\r\nCollege, Blackheath (founded for decayed merchants about 1695) also\r\nexists. It is about a quarter of an acre in size, with about eighty\r\ntombstones, but the graves have been levelled, and the ground, though\r\nstill walled round, forms part of the College gardens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW FROM THE ALMSHOUSES, WHITE HORSE STREET, STEPNEY.]\r\n\r\nThere were several almshouse graveyards in London, including the\r\n“College yard” for St. Saviour’s Almshouses, Southwark, which is now a\r\nbuilder’s store-yard in Park Street, and over which the London,\r\nBrighton, and South Coast Railway passes on arches, and one behind the\r\nGoldsmith’s Almshouses, now covered by the artisans’ dwellings on the\r\nwest side of Goldsmith Row, Shoreditch. The frightfully crowded\r\n“almshouse ground” in Clement’s Lane formed part of the site of the new\r\nLaw Courts; while one in Crown Street, Soho, adjoining St. Martin’s\r\nAlmshouses, disappeared when the French Chapel was built, and has now\r\nbeen lost in Charing Cross Road. In order to enter the almshouses in\r\nWhite Horse Street, Stepney, it is necessary to pass through a\r\ngraveyard, and it cannot be a lively outlook for the pensioners, who\r\nhave gravestones just under their windows. It was connected with the\r\nIndependent Chapel, and first used in 1781.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most interesting of these burial-grounds is one which\r\nbelonged to the Bancroft Almshouses in Mile End Road. The fate of the\r\nasylum itself is well known; it has been replaced by the People’s\r\nPalace, and the improvement from an antiquarian or architectural point\r\nof view is nil. The recent interest taken in the proposed destruction of\r\nthe Trinity Hospital in Mile End Road points to the fact that the\r\npendulum of public opinion is now swinging towards the preservation of\r\nhistorical buildings. The graveyard of Bancroft’s Almshouses was a long\r\nstrip on the eastern side. Part of it has been merged into the roadway.\r\nSt. Benet’s Church (consecrated in 1872), Hall, and Vicarage were built\r\nupon it, and the bones of the pensioners are under the Vicarage garden.\r\nThe northernmost point of the graveyard is enclosed and rooted over, and\r\nforms a little yard where flag-staffs, &c., are stored. But between this\r\nand the wall of the Vicarage there is a piece open to the road, with\r\nsome heaps of stones in it and rubbish. There are, at any rate, four\r\ngravestones left, against the wall, and there may be others behind the\r\nstones; but I daresay it is only a very small proportion of those who\r\npass in and out of the Palace who have ever noticed this relic of the\r\nBancroft Almshouses.\r\n\r\nIn a large number of the London parishes it was necessary to have “poor\r\ngrounds,” _i.e._, graveyards where bodies could be interred at a\r\ntrifling cost or entirely at the cost of the parish; for,\r\nnotwithstanding the great dislike of the poor to “a pauper’s funeral,”\r\nand the efforts they will make to avoid it, there always have been cases\r\nin which no other sort of funeral can be arranged. Some of the “poor\r\ngrounds” were attached to the workhouses, others were merely a part of\r\nthe parish churchyards, while others again were older additional\r\nburial-grounds secured by the parishes before the days of workhouses.\r\n\r\nThe workhouse of St. Andrew’s, Holborn, was in Shoe Lane, and in the\r\nadjoining graveyard the unfortunate young genius, Chatterton, was\r\nburied. This ground gave way to the Farringdon Market, which, in its\r\nturn, has been supplanted by a new street called Farringdon Avenue. The\r\nworkhouse ground of St. Sepulchre’s, Holborn, together with another\r\nadditional graveyard belonging to the parish, was in Durham Yard, and\r\nthe sites of both of them have disappeared in the goods depôt of the\r\nGreat Northern Railway. The burial-grounds by the workhouses of\r\nShoreditch, St. Paul’s, Covent Garden, and St. Giles (in Short’s\r\nGardens) have also disappeared; so also has the one allotted to the use\r\nof St. James’ Workhouse in Poland Street, which was a part of the old\r\npest-field, although a remnant of the pest-field exists still as the\r\nworkhouse garden. The original Whitechapel Workhouse was built in 1768\r\non a burial-ground, and then a plot of land immediately to the north was\r\nset aside for a poor ground, and consecrated in 1796. This in turn\r\nbecame the playground of the Davenant Schools, one of which (facing St.\r\nMary’s Street) was built in it. A recent addition to the other school\r\nhas also encroached on the burial-ground. In 1832 196 cholera cases were\r\ninterred in an adjoining piece of ground, which was probably what is now\r\nused as a stoneyard, and is full of carts. The workhouse graveyard,\r\nbelonging to St. Clement Danes, was in Portugal Street. The workhouse\r\nitself was re-adapted and re-opened as King’s College Hospital, but the\r\nburial-ground was used until its condition was so loathsome, and the\r\nburning of coffins and mutilation of bodies was of such every-day\r\noccurrence, that it must have been one of the very worst of such places\r\nin London. It is now the garden or courtyard and approach, between the\r\nhospital and Portugal Street. The burial-ground attached to the\r\nWorkhouse of St. Saviour’s, Southwark (which may have been the old\r\nBaptist burial-ground in Bandy Leg Walk which existed in 1729) has a\r\ncurious history. The workhouse was supplanted by Winchester House, the\r\npalace of the bishops when South London was in their diocese, the old\r\nWinchester House, nearer the river, having been destroyed. This in time\r\nbecame a hat manufactory, the burial-ground remaining as a garden\r\nsituated between the building and Southwark Bridge Road. Finally, the\r\nsite was secured by the Metropolitan Board of Works for the Central Fire\r\nBrigade Station, and what is now left of the burial-ground is the garden\r\nor courtyard between the new buildings which face the road and the old\r\nhouse behind them. If the paupers and the bishops and the factory hands\r\ndid not succeed in frightening away the ghosts of the departed, they\r\nmust have a sorry time of it now when the call-bells from all parts of\r\nLondon bring out the engines and the men who fight the flames.\r\n\r\nOf the parochial “poor grounds” not adjoining workhouses a few are worth\r\nnoticing. St. Saviour’s, Southwark, in addition to the workhouse ground,\r\nthe College or Almshouse ground, and the churchyard itself, which was\r\nfrom time to time added to, curtailed and used for markets, possessed\r\nstill another graveyard, the famous Cross Bones ground in Union Street,\r\nreferred to by Stow as having been made “far from the Parish Church,”\r\nfor the interment of the low women who frequented the neighbourhood. It\r\nsubsequently became the parish poor ground, and after having been in\r\nuse, and very much overcrowded, for upwards of 200 years, it was closed\r\nby order in Council dated October 24, 1853. In a report upon the state\r\nof this ground the previous year, it is stated that “it is crowded with\r\ndead, and many fragments of undecayed bones, some even entire, are mixed\r\nup with the earth of the mounds over the graves,” and it “can be\r\nconsidered only as a convenient place for getting rid of the dead, but\r\nit bears no marks of ever having been set apart as a place of Christian\r\nsepulture.” The Cross Bones ground passed out of the hands of the rector\r\nseveral years ago and was sold as a building site, but building\r\noperations were opposed and stopped. Schools were erected in it before\r\nit was closed for burials. It has been the subject of much litigation,\r\nand it now stands vacant, waiting for some one to purchase it as a\r\nplayground, and used in the meantime as the site for fairs,\r\nmerry-go-rounds, and cheap shows.\r\n\r\nThe “poor ground” for the parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark, is\r\na square plot of land, now a little public garden, in Tabard Street. It\r\nwas originally the burial-ground of the adjoining Lock Hospital before\r\nthat building was removed in 1809 to Knightsbridge, whence, later on, it\r\nwas again removed to Harrow Road. It is said by some that the little\r\ncemetery was even older than the hospital, and may have been used for\r\ninterments during no less than eight centuries. The Cripplegate “Poor\r\nground,” or the “upper churchyard of St. Giles,” was in Bear and Ragged\r\nStaff Yard (afterwards called Warwick Place) out of Whitecross Street,\r\nand was first used in 1636. It was very much overcrowded, so much so\r\nthat it was more than once shut up for a few years as full, but always\r\nre-opened again. A part of the site is now occupied by the northern half\r\nof the church of St. Mary, Charterhouse, and by its mission-house, there\r\nbeing only a tar-paved pathway round these buildings to represent the\r\nrest of the ground. The church was built in 1864. There are human\r\nremains within six inches of the surface of the ground, several having\r\nbeen dug up and put in a vault which is under the mission-house, and the\r\nentrance to which is closed with a very large flat stone, bearing the\r\ndate of 1865. The mission-house is giving way already, and it has large\r\ncracks in it, for a vault of this kind is not a good foundation.\r\n\r\nThe parish of St. James’, Clerkenwell, had a very small “poor ground,”\r\nin Ray Street, which was bought in 1755 for £340, and was consecrated\r\neight years later. It was 800 square yards in area, and was approached\r\nthrough a private house occupied by a butcher, “who had his\r\nslaughter-house and stable at the back, and immediately adjoining the\r\nburial-ground.” In about the year 1824 it was found that several bodies\r\nhad been exhumed and placed in the stable; this caused a scandal in the\r\nneighbourhood, and the man and his business were ruined. When Farringdon\r\nStreet and the Metropolitan Railway were made, the site of the ground in\r\nRay Street, together with Ray Street itself, entirely disappeared; and\r\nthe “sleepers of the railway are laid over the sleepers in death.” The\r\nburial-ground had already been done away with, the Clerkenwell\r\nCommissioners, according to Pinks, having taken it for public\r\nimprovements, when they collected the remains into one spot and erected\r\na plain mausoleum over them.\r\n\r\nIn early days it seems to have been the custom for patients entering the\r\nlarge hospitals to pay a sum of money down for possible funeral\r\nexpenses, except in cases of sudden accident. Later on a security given\r\nby a householder was considered sufficient, but now no such arrangement\r\nis needed. The sum demanded at St. Bartholomew’s was 17s. 6d., and at\r\nGuy’s £1 was paid. At Westminster Hospital and at the Lock (Hyde Park\r\nCorner), from which some patients may have been buried in what is now\r\ncalled Knightsbridge Green, no security was asked; but at the Bethlem\r\nHospital an entrance sum of £100 had to be paid for board, funeral\r\nexpenses, &c. In case of death at a London hospital at the present time,\r\nthe friends or relations of the deceased are expected to remove and bury\r\nthe body, and this has often led to a good deal of difficulty, one body\r\nbeing claimed by various people, because the person who buries it can\r\noften secure the insurance money. Bodies which are now unclaimed (and at\r\nSt. Bartholomew’s there are about eight in a year) are buried in a\r\ncemetery at the cost of the hospital.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                  PRIVATE AND PROMISCUOUS CEMETERIES.\r\n\r\n      “Praises on tombs are trifles vainly spent,\r\n       A man’s good name is his best monument.”\r\n    _Epitaph on Pindar’s monument in St. Botolph’s, Aldersgate Street._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERE are two chief senses in which the word “private” may be taken. It\r\ndenotes what belongs to a particular person, family, or institution\r\napart from the general public—thus we say a “private chapel,” a “private\r\ndrive,” and so on. It also means that which has been set into being by a\r\nprivate individual, and which is, therefore, a private speculation. Into\r\nthese two classes I can divide the graveyards which are to be dealt with\r\nin this chapter.\r\n\r\nThe Romans preserved the right of erecting tombs in their country\r\nresidences. Their very stringent laws prevented them from burying the\r\ndead inside the cities (except certain classes of privileged persons),\r\nbut as long as the interment took place outside the walls, it seems, at\r\none time, to have mattered little where a tomb was set up. This practice\r\nwas put a stop to in the time of Duillius, and sepulchres were no longer\r\nallowed in fields and private grounds, as it was found that the custom\r\nwas tending to diminish the area of land available for cultivation.\r\n\r\nI think that such a practice was never general in London or the\r\nsurrounding district, but there are a few cases in which something of\r\nthe sort took place. In Wood’s “Ecclesiastical Antiquities” it is stated\r\nthat there was a cemetery at Somerset House, Strand, for the Catholic\r\nmembers of Queen Henrietta Maria’s household (1626). It is certain that\r\nthe vaults under the palace chapel were used, as they were closed for\r\ninterments in 1777 (fourteen burials having taken place in fifty-seven\r\nyears), and if there was also a cemetery, the use of which was in this\r\nway restricted, it may fairly be called private. It is possible however\r\nthat this may have been a part of the original churchyard of St. Mary le\r\nStrand. The site has now disappeared, the present building of Somerset\r\nHouse being far more extended than was the old one.\r\n\r\nAnother curious private ground, also used by Romanists, was the garden\r\nof Hundsdon House, the French Embassy, in Blackfriars. In 1623 the floor\r\nof a neighbouring Jesuit chapel gave way, and about 95 persons were\r\nkilled. Stow says that 20 bodies (of the poorer people) were buried on\r\nthe spot. Malcolm states that 44 were buried in the courtyard before the\r\nAmbassador’s house, and 15 in his garden. Brayley’s version is that some\r\nwere buried in a burying-place “within the Spanish Ambassador’s house in\r\nHolborn,” and that two great pits were dug, one in the forecourt of the\r\nFrench Ambassador’s house, 18 feet by 12 feet, where 44 were interred,\r\nthe other in the garden behind, 12 feet by 8 feet. Wood gives the number\r\nof those buried in these pits as 47. It was, at any rate, a curious and\r\nsummary way of disposing of the bodies of those who had so suddenly lost\r\ntheir lives.\r\n\r\nI only know of one burial-ground in London which is so strictly private\r\nas to have only one grave in it. In Retreat Place, Hackney, a quiet\r\ncorner near the Unitarian Church, there is a row of twelve almshouses,\r\nfounded by Samuel Robinson in 1812, “for the widows of Dissenting\r\nministers professing Calvinistic doctrines.” In front of this\r\nestablishment is a neatly-kept grass plot, and in the centre of it is a\r\nlarge altar tomb—not erected for the use of the ministers’ widows, but\r\ncontaining the mortal remains of Samuel Robinson, who died in 1833, and\r\nof his own widow who survived him three years. For my own part I should\r\nprefer the enclosure without the grave, but perhaps the widows like to\r\nbe daily reminded of their benefactor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BURIAL-GROUND IN NEWGATE GAOL.]\r\n\r\nThere are, no doubt, many private gardens and yards in London in which\r\nburials have taken place, surreptitiously if not openly. Only recently\r\nan undertaker was remanded for having been in the habit of temporarily\r\ndepositing the bodies of stillborn infants in his own back premises\r\nuntil such time as there should be enough to make it worth while for him\r\nto give them a decent burial. But, numerous as these instances may be,\r\nit is difficult to get any record of them.\r\n\r\nConvent burial-grounds are very private, but of these I have already\r\nspoken in Chapter II. In Millbank Penitentiary a space, 432 square yards\r\nin extent, was set aside as a graveyard, in which there was ordinarily\r\nrather over one burial per month. There is a picture of it in Griffith’s\r\n“Memorials of Millbank,” but no description. This particular plot of\r\nground is to be preserved as an open space when the new buildings are\r\nerected on the site of the prison; it will probably belong to the London\r\nSchool Board. Newgate burial-ground is still in use. It is a passage in\r\nthe prison, 10 feet wide and 85 feet long, in which are interred, with a\r\nplentiful supply of quicklime, the bodies of those who are executed\r\nwithin the walls. This reminds me of the gallows which stood for so many\r\nyears at the Tyburn turnpike, the site of which is still marked by a\r\nstone in the Bayswater Road, a few yards west of the Marble Arch. Those\r\nwho were executed here (there were 24 in 1729) were buried on the spot,\r\nand this extraordinary burial-ground was situated at the point now\r\noccupied by the house at the corner of Edgware Road and Upper Bryanston\r\nStreet.[7] Mr. W. J. Loftie entirely discredits this story, and says\r\nthat one jawbone is all that was ever found to represent human remains\r\non this site. On their way to the gallows the poor criminals received a\r\npresent of a large bowl of ale, called St. Giles’ bowl, from the lazar\r\nhospital of St. Giles, which was situated close to where the church now\r\nstands. And thus they were refreshed on their last sad journey.\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  Smith’s “St. Marylebone.”\r\n\r\nBy the close of the last century the London churchyards, and the\r\nadditional burial-grounds provided by the parishes, were becoming so\r\novercrowded, that it occurred to some adventurers to start cemeteries as\r\nprivate speculations; and it was greatly owing to their existence and to\r\ntheir abuse that the agitation arose which finally led to the passing of\r\nthe “Act to amend the Laws concerning the Burial of the Dead in the\r\nMetropolis,” under which the metropolitan burial-grounds were closed.\r\nThe speculation was found to be a successful one, and was imitated in\r\ndifferent parts of London, until by the year 1835 there must have been\r\nat least fourteen burial-grounds in London carried on by private\r\npersons, besides some additional chapels with vaults under them\r\nconducted in the same way. A few of these grounds originated in\r\nconnection with neighbouring places of worship, but were subsequently\r\nbought by private persons. In Central London there were (1) Spa Fields,\r\nClerkenwell; (2) Thomas’ burial-ground, Golden Lane; (3) the New City\r\nBunhill Fields, or the City of London burial-ground, Golden Lane. In\r\nNorth London there was (4) the New or Little Bunhill Fields, Church\r\nStreet, Islington. In East London there were (5) Sheen’s burial-ground,\r\nWhitechapel; (6) Victoria Park Cemetery, Bethnal Green; (7) the East\r\nLondon Cemetery or Beaumont’s ground, Mile End; (8) Globe Fields\r\nburial-ground, Mile End Old Town; (9) the North-east London Cemetery, or\r\nCambridge Heath burial-ground, or Peel Grove burial-ground, or Keldy’s\r\nGround, Bethnal Green; (10) Gibraltar Walk burial-ground, Bethnal Green;\r\n(11) Ebenezer Chapel ground, Ratcliff Highway. And in South London (12)\r\nButler’s burial-ground, Horselydown, or St. John’s; (13) the New Bunhill\r\nFields, or Hoole and Martin’s ground, Deverell Street, New Kent Road;\r\nand (14) a ground in Ewer Street, Southwark.\r\n\r\nThe charges made for interments in these places were generally slightly\r\nlower than in the churchyards, in order to attract customers, and those\r\nwho officiated at the funerals were, in many cases, not ministers of\r\nreligion at all. In Butler’s burial-ground, for instance, the person who\r\nread the burial service (of the Church of England) wore a surplice, but\r\nhe was merely an employé of the undertaker, who also acted as porter. In\r\nHoole and Martin’s ground a Mr. Thomas Jenner was employed to officiate\r\nat funerals for £20 a year. He also read the burial service of the\r\nChurch of England, but he was by trade a shoemaker, or a patten-maker,\r\nwhose shop was close by. The owners of these private grounds were\r\nnaturally tempted to crowd them to excess, and it is impossible to think\r\nof what took place in some of them without shuddering. No doubt\r\npractices as vile, as unwholesome, and as irreverent were carried on in\r\nmany of the churchyards; but the over-crowding of the private grounds is\r\nso associated with the idea of private gloating over private gains that\r\nit is more repulsive.\r\n\r\nOne of the most notoriously offensive spots in London was Enon Chapel,\r\nClement’s Lane. The chapel was built, and the vaults under it were made,\r\nas a speculation by a dissenting minister named Howse. The burial-fees\r\nwere small, and the place was resorted to by the poor, as many as nine\r\nor ten burials often taking place on a Sunday afternoon. The space\r\navailable for coffins was, at the highest computation, 59 feet by 29\r\nfeet, with a depth of 6 feet, and no less than 20,000 coffins were\r\ndeposited there. In order to accomplish this herculean task it was the\r\ncommon practice to burn the older coffins in the minister’s house, under\r\nhis copper and in his fireplaces. Between the coffins and the floor of\r\nthe chapel there was nothing but the boards. In time the effluvium in\r\nthe chapel became intolerable, and no one attended the services, but the\r\nvaults were still used for interments, so that “more money was made from\r\nthe dead than from the living”—a state of affairs which existed in many\r\nof the private burial-places of the metropolis. As I shall have to refer\r\nagain to the condition of these grounds in speaking of the closing of\r\ngraveyards in London, I will not enlarge upon it any further here,\r\nexcept to quote from the evidence brought before the Select Committee\r\nwhich sat in 1842 to consider the question of Interment in Towns,\r\nrespecting the Globe Fields burial-ground in Mile End, which is merely\r\none example out of sixty-five examinations.\r\n\r\nWilliam Miller, called in and examined.\r\n\r\n“1615. CHAIRMAN. What is your occupation?—A jobbing, labouring man, when\r\nI can get anything to do.”\r\n\r\n“1616. Have you been a gravedigger in Globe Fields. Mile End?—Yes.”\r\n\r\n“1617. Is that a private burying-ground?—Yes.”\r\n\r\n“1618. To whom does it belong?—Mr. Thomas Tagg.”\r\n\r\n“1620. Have many pits been dug in it for the depositing of bodies\r\npreviously interred?—Yes.”\r\n\r\n“1621. Where did they come from?—Out of the coffins which were emptied\r\nfor others to go into the graves.”\r\n\r\n“1623. Were the coffins chucked in with them?—No; they were broken up\r\nand burnt.”\r\n\r\n“1624. Were they bones, or bodies, that were interred?—Yes; the bones\r\nand bodies as well.”\r\n\r\n“1625. Were they entire, or in a state of decomposition?—Some were dry\r\nbones, and some were perfect.”\r\n\r\n“1627. What did you do with them?—Chucked them into the pit.”\r\n\r\n“1628. What sort of pit?—A deep, square pit, about four feet wide and\r\nseven or eight feet deep.”\r\n\r\n“1629. How many bodies did you chuck in?—I cannot say, they were so\r\nnumerous; each pit would hold about a dozen.”\r\n\r\n“1630. How many of these pits did you dig?—I suppose I dug a matter of\r\n20 myself.”\r\n\r\n“1632. How near to the surface of the earth did these dead bodies or\r\nbones come?—Within about two feet.”\r\n\r\n“1638. What is the size of this ground?—It is rather better than half an\r\nacre.”\r\n\r\n“1639. How many bodies are buried in that ground within a year?—I cannot\r\nsay; I suppose there are 14,000 have been buried in that ground.”\r\n\r\n“1640. How long has it been open?—Since the year 1820.”\r\n\r\n“1641. Do you recollect any circumstance which occurred there about the\r\nmonth of October, 1839?—Yes.”\r\n\r\n“1642. Will you state it to the Committee?—Some boys were at work there;\r\na policeman on the railroad happened to see them in the act of taking\r\nsome bones out of baskets, and got a policeman in the police force of\r\nthe metropolis, and sent him in and seized the boys with a bag of nails\r\nand plates of the coffins, going away to sell them, and going to sell\r\nthe bones.”\r\n\r\n“1643. To what purpose are the bones applied?—I do not know.”\r\n\r\n“1644. What is done with the wood of the coffins?—Burnt for their own\r\nprivate use.”\r\n\r\n“1645. By whom?—By the sexton.”\r\n\r\n“1648. MR. COWPER. Is it burnt in the sexton’s house?—Yes.”\r\n\r\n“1649. SIR WILLIAM CLAY. What was done with the iron or metal handles of\r\nthe coffins?—They were burnt on the coffins when I was there, and were\r\nthrown out among the ashes about the ground anywhere.”\r\n\r\n“1653. MR. AINSWORTH. Who performs the burial service over the dead?—A\r\ngentleman of the name of Cauch.”\r\n\r\n“1654. Does he reside there?—No, he resides opposite.”\r\n\r\n“1655. What is he?—I do not know that he is anything; he has formerly\r\nbeen a shoemaker.”\r\n\r\n“1656. Does he put on a gown when he buries the dead?—Yes, a surplice.”\r\n\r\n“1657. What service does he read?—The regular Church service.”\r\n\r\n“1665. CHAIRMAN. Were you in the habit of performing this grave-digging\r\nwithout the use of spirits?—No; we were obliged to be half groggy to do\r\nit, and we cheered one another and sung to one another.”\r\n\r\n“1666. You found the work so disgusting you were obliged to be half\r\ndrunk?—Yes.”\r\n\r\nAnd so on. Many of the revelations made to this committee are so\r\nrevolting that they are best forgotten. It is, perhaps, only fair to say\r\nthat this particular man’s evidence was contradicted by Mr. Thomas Tagg,\r\nthe owner of the ground, but it was subsequently corroborated by other\r\nand disinterested witnesses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PEEL GROVE BURIAL-GROUND, BETHNAL GREEN.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VICTORIA PARK CEMETERY BEFORE BEING LAID OUT.]\r\n\r\nThe fate of these fourteen grounds has been a varied one. Thomas’s has\r\ngone, and its site is occupied by a large building, chiefly a shoe\r\nfactory, on the north side of Playhouse Yard, and immediately to the\r\nwest of the church known as St. Mary’s Charterhouse. Sheen’s is now the\r\nyard of Messrs. Fairclough, carters, off Commercial Road, and there are\r\nsome stables and sheds in it. It was, some few years back, a cooperage.\r\nPeel Grove burial-ground is smaller than it was, and what is left is a\r\nbuilder’s yard about an acre in extent, the remainder of the space\r\nhaving been built upon. The very small ground by Ebenezer Chapel, near\r\nSt. George’s in the East, is also a timber-yard, the chapel itself\r\nhaving long since fallen into disuse. Over half of the Globe Fields\r\nground the Great Eastern Railway runs; the remainder is a bare yard,\r\nwith several miserable tombstones in it and quantities of rubbish. It is\r\nfast closed behind an iron gate of colossal proportions, and it daily\r\nbecomes more neglected and untidy. Little Bunhill Fields in Islington is\r\ndivided into several parts; one division belongs to the General Post\r\nOffice, and contains parcels-carts, &c., other pieces are let or sold as\r\nbuilders’ yards or are lying vacant. New Bunhill Fields, near New Kent\r\nRoad, has been through many vicissitudes. It was very much overcrowded\r\nwith bodies, and in the vault under the chapel burials used to take\r\nplace “on lease,” _i.e._ £1 would be paid for a coffin to be deposited\r\nfor six months, after which time no inquiries were to be made. As soon\r\nas the ground was closed for burials it became a timber-yard, and the\r\nchapel in it was used as a saw-mill. Now the sawing goes on in an\r\nadjoining shed, and the chapel belongs to the Salvation Army, the\r\ngraveyard being still covered with high stacks of timber. The City of\r\nLondon ground, in Golden Lane, which was only used for about twenty\r\nyears, is divided. The part situated in the parish of St. Luke’s belongs\r\nto Messrs. Sutton & Co., carriers, and is full of carts, the greater\r\npart of it being roofed in. The part situated within the city boundary\r\nforms the site of the City Mortuary and Coroner’s Court, with a\r\nneatly-kept yard between the two buildings. Gibraltar Walk\r\nburial-ground, Bethnal Green Road, has only had small slices cut off it\r\nand doled out as yards, &c., for the surrounding houses. The main\r\nportion is a neglected jungle, forming a sort of private garden to the\r\nbig house which opens on to it, and in which the owner of the ground\r\nlives. In order to see Butler’s burial-ground it is necessary to go down\r\nCoxon’s Place, Horselydown, where two yards will be found. One is a\r\nsmall builder’s yard, with “Beware of the Dog” on the gate. Once I\r\ndoubted the existence of the dog, and pushed open this gate, but he was\r\nthere in full vigour, and I speedily fled. The adjoining yard, which is\r\nmuch larger, is Messrs. Zurhoost’s cooperage, and is full of barrels.\r\nThere were vaults used for burials under three or four of the houses.\r\nThey can still be seen, and are now, apparently, dwelling-places for the\r\nliving. The graveyard in Ewer Street has disappeared under the London\r\nBridge and Charing Cross Railway.\r\n\r\nThe East London Cemetery, in Shandy Street, Mile End, is a recreation\r\nground chiefly for children. So is Spa Fields, Clerkenwell, which was\r\none of the most crowded burial-grounds in London, after having been a\r\nfashionable tea-garden, and before being used as a volunteer\r\ndrill-ground. Both these grounds were secured and laid out by the\r\nMetropolitan Public Gardens Association, and are maintained by the\r\nLondon County Council. Such is also the history of Victoria Park\r\nCemetery, a space of 11½ acres, and by far the largest of the private\r\nventure burial-grounds. In this ground it was stated that, on every\r\nSunday in the year 1856, 130 bodies were interred. After years of\r\nnegotiation and much difficulty, the Metropolitan Public Gardens\r\nAssociation secured it, and converted it from a dreary waste of\r\ncrumbling tombstones and sinking graves into a most charming little park\r\nfor the people of Bethnal Green. It was opened by H.R.H. the Duke of\r\nYork in July, 1894, and the County Council maintains it, having\r\nre-christened it Meath Gardens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VICTORIA PARK CEMETERY WHEN FIRST LAID OUT.]\r\n\r\nIt need hardly be pointed out that in very few of the spaces I have just\r\ndescribed are any tombstones to be found. To a casual observer they are\r\nutterly unrecognisable as burial-grounds, and it is many years since\r\nsuch relics can have existed in them. When, for instance, a\r\nburial-ground becomes a builder’s yard, tombstones are very much in the\r\nway, and they are soon converted into paving-stones, Some years ago a\r\nfew inscriptions were still legible on the stones which paved the\r\npassage to Spa Fields from Exmouth Street, but by this time even these\r\nmust be worn away. But if it is denied by the owners of these yards that\r\nthey are burial-grounds there is one method of proving it which soon\r\ndispels all doubt, and that is by digging down into the soil. It will\r\nnot be necessary to make any deep excavation before the spade turns up\r\nsome earth mixed with human remains, which, once seen, are always\r\nrecognisable.\r\n\r\nArchbishop Herring adopted this plan, as he was anxious to know if any\r\nburials had taken place in what was always known as the “burying-ground”\r\nof Lambeth Palace, on the north side of the chapel, by the site of the\r\nsmaller cloisters. In fact he had the whole space dug over, but without\r\nsuccess, for no signs of human remains were found; and it is probable\r\nthat the interments which took place within the palace were all under\r\nthe chapel.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n             THE CLOSING OF THE BURIAL-GROUNDS AND VAULTS.\r\n\r\n           “These laugh at Jeat, and Marble put for signs,\r\n           To sever the good fellowship of dust,\r\n           And spoil the meeting. What shall point out them,\r\n           When they shall bow, and kneel, and fall down flat\r\n           To kiss those heaps which now they have in trust?”\r\n                                      GEORGE HERBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY the commencement of the present century the minds of thoughtful men\r\non the Continent, in America, and in England, began to be exercised\r\nabout the overcrowded state of the graveyards in the towns, and their\r\nvery unwholesome effect upon those who lived near them.\r\n\r\nWe owe the agitation which finally led to the closing of the London\r\ngraveyards mainly to the untiring zeal of a surgeon of Drury Lane,\r\nGeorge Alfred Walker. His work lay amongst the poor of that district,\r\nand he was led to believe that the frequent occurrence of what he called\r\ntyphus fever, and similar maladies, was due in great measure to the\r\nlarge number of overcrowded burial-grounds which existed in the\r\nneighbourhood. He made a very careful study of the subject, he gathered\r\ninformation from France, Germany, and other countries, he visited a\r\nlarge number of the worst graveyards in London, and made searching\r\ninquiries respecting them. Having become familiar with the practices\r\nthat were carried on in these places, he brought out a book dealing with\r\nthe whole question in the year 1839, the title-page of which fully\r\nexplains its purpose. It is as follows:—\r\n\r\n\r\n                      “GATHERINGS FROM GRAVEYARDS,\r\n\r\n                     PARTICULARLY THOSE OF LONDON.\r\n\r\n         With a concise History of the modes of Interment among\r\n              different Nations from the earliest periods,\r\n                       and a detail of dangerous\r\n                           and fatal results\r\n              produced by the unwise and revolting custom\r\n            of inhuming the dead in the midst of the living.\r\n\r\n                       By G. A. WALKER, Surgeon.”\r\n\r\nThe question was taken up from purely philanthropic motives. Walker was\r\nnot connected with, or interested in, any particular Cemetery, but he\r\nwas “fully convinced of the necessity for _legislative interference_ to\r\ndestroy the present dangerous system.”\r\n\r\nHe had precedents to go upon, for as early as the year 1765 a decree was\r\nmade by the Parliament of Paris, closing all cemeteries and churchyards\r\nwithin the city, and providing for the formation of eight cemeteries in\r\nthe suburbs; and in 1774 a further decree was made prohibiting the\r\nre-opening of vaults, similar action being subsequently taken in other\r\nFrench towns. Nor was France alone to be admired. Precautions of the\r\nsame kind were adopted from time to time in Rome and other cities of\r\nItaly, in Denmark, in New York, and even in Dublin; but the London\r\nburial-grounds still continued to be in constant use.\r\n\r\nWalker collected details of many cases of death and illness directly\r\nattributable to contact with human remains in a state of putrefaction.\r\nIt was certain that gravediggers held their lives in their hands. The\r\nmore experienced of them, when they “bored” or “tapped” coffins,\r\nimmediately fled to a distance, and remained away until they considered\r\nthat the harmful exhalations would have been sufficiently distributed\r\ninto the air for them to continue their unpleasant work in comparative\r\nsafety. Another custom was to burn papers, &c., in graves and vaults,\r\nwhile some men were in the habit of holding rue and garlic in their\r\nmouths. But they generally suffered from bad health, were frequently\r\nseriously ill, and sometimes died from the direct effects of the poison\r\nthey had inhaled. They were also much addicted to drink, and very many\r\nwere accustomed to say that they could not do their work without the\r\nhelp of spirits.\r\n\r\nAfter making the following general statement, Walker carefully described\r\nbetween forty and fifty of the most crowded of the metropolitan\r\nburial-places, and especially those in his own district: “Although\r\nwilling to admit that the neighbourhood of slaughter-houses—the\r\ndecomposition of vegetable substances—the narrowness of the streets, and\r\nthe filth and poverty of some of the inhabitants, greatly contributed to\r\nthe furtherance of the mischief (typhus fever), I felt convinced that\r\nthe grand cause of all the evil was the immediate proximity of the\r\nburial-places, public as well as private.” It is quite unnecessary to\r\nrepeat the descriptions, they are much alike; I will only give one as a\r\nspecimen, which is free from obnoxious details.\r\n\r\n“_St. Ann’s, Soho._—There is only one burying-ground belonging to this\r\nparish; it is walled in on the side next to Prince’s Street; close to\r\nthis wall is the bone house; rotten coffin wood and fragments of bones\r\nare scattered about. Some graves are only partly filled up, and left in\r\nthat state, intended, probably, for paupers. The ground is very full,\r\nand is considerably raised above its original level; it is overlooked by\r\nhouses thickly inhabited. The inhabitants of the neighbourhood have\r\nfrequently complained of the past and present condition of this place.\r\nThe numbers of dead here are immense.”\r\n\r\nSome of his descriptions were thought at the time to be exaggerated, but\r\nthey were fully corroborated in the evidence given before the\r\nParliamentary Committee which sat in 1842.\r\n\r\nSuch a note as the following is instructive: “Ground in immediate\r\nproximity to this place” (Bermondsey Churchyard) “is advertised to be\r\nlet on lease for building purposes.” And yet some of the very\r\nburial-grounds themselves have since become the sites for streets and\r\nhouses!\r\n\r\nIt would not be fair to give the reader the impression that Walker was\r\nthe first to speak of the unwholesome condition of the London\r\ngraveyards. Here is a quotation from a sermon preached by Bishop Latimer\r\nin 1552: “The citizens of Naim had their burying-places without the\r\ncity, which, no doubt, is a laudable thing; and I do marvel that London,\r\nbeing so great a city, hath not a burial-place without: for no doubt it\r\nis an unwholesome thing to bury within the city, especially at such a\r\ntime, when there be great sicknesses, and many die together. I think\r\nverily that many a man taketh his death in St. Paul’s Churchyard, and\r\nthis I speak of experience; for I myself, when I have been there on some\r\nmornings to hear the sermons, have felt such an ill-savoured,\r\nunwholesome savour, that I was the worse for it a great while after; and\r\nI think no less—but it is the occasion of great sickness and disease.”\r\nAnd from his time onwards allusions were made, in sermons and\r\ndiscourses, by ministers and physicians, to the dangers of contact with\r\ndecaying animal substances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHURCHYARD OF ST. ANN, SOHO, IN 1810.]\r\n\r\nTo turn from London for a moment. It is stated in Roger’s “Social Life\r\nin Scotland” that when Queen Mary visited Dundee in 1594 she found that\r\n“the deid of the Naill burgh is buryit in the midst thereof, quhairin\r\nthe common traffic of merchandise is usit, and that throw occasion of\r\nthe said burial, pest, and other contagious sickness is engenderit.” The\r\nevil was remedied by granting to the burgh as a place of sepulchre the\r\nsite of the Greyfriars Monastery.\r\n\r\nSir Christopher Wren, when considering the question of the rebuilding of\r\nLondon after the Great Fire, made some very wise remarks upon the\r\nquestion of intramural interments. He wished to see suburban cemeteries\r\nestablished, and burials in churches and churchyards discontinued,\r\npartly because he considered the constant raising of the level of a\r\nchurchyard rendered the church damp and more liable to premature decay.\r\nBut Wren’s plans for rebuilding the city were not carried out; they were\r\napproved by the King and Parliament, but disapproved by the Corporation;\r\nand this scheme of his respecting the practice of burial fell through\r\nwith the rest. The churches were rebuilt on the old sites, the\r\nchurchyards were again used, and the sites of several of those churches\r\nwhich were not rebuilt became additional burial-grounds for the\r\nparishes. And yet, in the return published in 1833, it is curious to\r\nfind that only one place is described as being “very full of bodies,”\r\nthe churchyard of St. John’s, Clerkenwell. There was no great desire on\r\nthe part of those connected with the parishes to increase their burial\r\naccommodation.\r\n\r\nWalker stuck to his ground manfully. He gathered round him a few of the\r\nleading men of the day, who formed themselves into a Society for the\r\nAbolition of Burials in Towns, and he delivered a series of able\r\nlectures upon the subject and continued to make inquiries and to expose\r\npractices carried on in various grounds. Spa Fields, for instance, was\r\ntaken as a specimen, and a pamphlet was issued showing how it was the\r\ncustom to burn bodies behind a brick enclosure, and how the gravestones\r\nwere moved about to give an appearance of emptiness in certain parts of\r\nthe ground. It was computed that, by burning coffins, mutilating\r\nremains, and using vast quantities of quicklime, at least 80,000 corpses\r\nhad been put in a space fitted to hold 1,000.\r\n\r\nIn 1842 and 1843 a Royal Commission was sitting upon the question of the\r\nHealth of Towns and the Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Classes, and\r\na Select Committee was appointed “to consider the expediency of framing\r\nsome Legislative Enactments (due respect being paid to the rights of the\r\nClergy), to remedy the evils arising from the Interment of Bodies within\r\nthe Precincts of large Towns, or of Places densely populated.” The\r\nfollowing were the members of the Committee: Mr. Mackinnon (Chairman),\r\nLord Ashley, Colonel Fox, Mr. Thomas Duncombe, Mr. Evelyn Denison, Sir\r\nWilliam Clay, Sir Robert Harry Inglis, Mr. Ainsworth, Mr. Beckett, Lord\r\nMahon, Mr. Cowper, Colonel Acton, Mr. Kemble, Mr. Vernon, and Mr.\r\nRedhead Yorke; and they sat from 17th of March till 5th of May, 1842,\r\nand conducted sixty-five examinations. Amongst the witnesses who gave\r\nevidence were clergymen, dissenting ministers, medical men, including\r\nSir Benjamin Brodie and Mr. Walker, sextons, gravediggers, residents in\r\nthe neighbourhood of burial-grounds and others, with the Bishop of\r\nLondon (C. J. Blomfield). I have already quoted from these evidences in\r\nthe previous chapter, and they do not vary very much. I will only\r\ntherefore give a few extracts from the Report of the Committee:—“After\r\nlong and patient investigation, Your Committee cannot arrive at any\r\nother conclusion than that the nuisance of Interments in large Towns,\r\nand the injury arising to the Health of the Community from the practice,\r\nare fully proved.... No time ought to be lost by the Legislature in\r\napplying a remedy.... The Evidence has also exhibited the singular\r\ninstance of the most wealthy, moral, and civilised community in the\r\nworld tolerating a practice and an abuse which has been corrected for\r\nyears by nearly all other civilised nations in every part of the globe.”\r\nThen follow resolutions respecting the provision by parishes, either\r\nsingle or amalgamated, of cemeteries; the fees which it would be\r\ndesirable to charge; the due consideration to be shown to those who\r\ndesired burial in unconsecrated ground; the exceptions to be made in the\r\ncases of some family vaults, of the Cathedral and the Abbey, and of\r\ncertain cemeteries which had recently been formed, &c., with the final\r\nremark: “That the duty of framing and introducing a Bill on the\r\nprinciples set forth in the foregoing Resolutions, would be most\r\nefficiently discharged by Her Majesty’s Government, and that it is\r\nearnestly recommended to them by the Committee.” And yet it was not\r\nuntil 1852 that Mr. Mackinnon’s Bill was introduced and the Act of\r\nParliament was passed, entitled an Act to Amend the Laws concerning the\r\nBurial of the Dead in the Metropolis, commonly known as the Burials Act,\r\n15 and 16 Victoria.\r\n\r\nThen the Home Secretary was besieged with memorials and letters from\r\nthose who resided in various parts of London, praying for the Act to be\r\nput in force in the burial-grounds in their own neighbourhoods, besides\r\napplications for permission to open cemeteries on the outskirts of the\r\ntown. The same dreary and miserable stories of the overcrowding of\r\ngraveyards and the indecent practices carried on in them were again\r\nbrought to light, and it must not be supposed that the grounds in the\r\nwest of London were any better than those in the centre, the east, or\r\nthe south. The description given by the memorialists (five medical men)\r\nof the burial-ground belonging to St. George’s, Hanover Square, which is\r\nsituated on the north side of Bayswater Road, together with the letters\r\nwritten about it, could hardly be exceeded. And yet this ground was, or\r\nrather is, in a fashionable neighbourhood, close to the Marble Arch, and\r\nsurrounded by houses let at very high rentals. It is certain that it was\r\na common custom to move freshly-buried bodies from the more expensive\r\npart of the ground to the cheaper part, used for paupers and others,\r\nthus making room for more graves for which the higher fees were paid.\r\nLawrence Sterne, who wrote “The Sentimental Journey,” was buried here. I\r\nhope his remains did not have an unsentimental one.\r\n\r\nFrom west, east, north, and south the same lament was heard, and the\r\nsame petition came from other cities and towns in England. It was a\r\ncommon topic for the newspapers and journals, and it is hardly possible\r\nto look through any of them, published between 1850 and 1855, without\r\nfinding references to the graveyards, or notices of their being closed\r\nby order in Council. An anonymous poem called “City Graves,” appeared in\r\n_Household Words_ on December 14, 1850. It has seven verses, of which I\r\nwill give three:—\r\n\r\n                “Within those walls, the peace of death—\r\n                   Without, life’s ceaseless din;\r\n                 The toiler, at his work, can see\r\n                   The tombs of his mouldering kin;\r\n                 And the living without grow, day by day,\r\n                   More like the dead within.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                “I saw from out the earth peep forth\r\n                   The white and glistening bones,\r\n                 With jagged ends of coffin planks,\r\n                   That e’en the worm disowns;\r\n                 And once a smooth round skull rolled on,\r\n                   Like a football, on the stones.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                “Too late the wished-for boon has come,\r\n                   Too late wiped out the stain,—\r\n                 No Schedule shall restore to health,\r\n                   No Act give life again\r\n                 To the thousands whom, in bygone years,\r\n                   Our City Graves have slain!”\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of January, 1853, Islington Churchyard was closed for\r\nburials, and from that time forward the notices were issued for the\r\ncessation of interments in vaults and graveyards all over London; and\r\nthe list which was printed of all the burial-grounds in London still\r\nopen for interments on January 1, 1855 (and in many of these only the\r\nexisting vaults were to be used), was quite a short one. By that date\r\neight of the large cemeteries had been opened and were in use.\r\n\r\nWhen once closed for burials the question naturally arose as to what was\r\nto be done with the grounds. The following clause was inserted into one\r\nof the Burial Acts (18 and 19 Vict.):—\r\n\r\n“18. In every case in which any order in Council has been or shall\r\nhereafter be issued for the discontinuance of burials in any churchyard\r\nor burial-ground, the Burial Board or Churchwardens, as the case may be,\r\nshall maintain such churchyard or burial-ground of any parish in decent\r\norder, and also do the necessary repair of the walls and other fences\r\nthereof, and the costs and expenses shall be repaid by the Overseers,\r\nupon the certificate of the Burial Board or Churchwardens, as the case\r\nmay be, out of the rate made for the relief of the Poor of the parish or\r\nplace in which such churchyard or burial-ground is situate, unless there\r\nshall be some other fund legally chargeable with such costs and\r\nexpenses.”\r\n\r\nHere at once comes in the difficulty of ownership or guardianship, and\r\nit is not always understood by the rector or vicar of a church that he,\r\nduring his incumbency, has the sole right of using any grounds enclosed\r\nwithin the churchyard fence or wall, and that these grounds are not, as\r\nis frequently supposed, under the joint control of the incumbent and\r\nchurchwardens. This is clearly set forth in the following quotations\r\nfrom the book of Church Law, 4th edition, page 322:—\r\n\r\n“By his induction into the real and corporeal possession of his benefice\r\nin general, a Rector or Vicar becomes invested, in particular, with\r\nfreehold rights in all the land and buildings which are enclosed within\r\nthe churchyard fence or wall.”\r\n\r\n“The rights thus acquired carry with them the exclusive right of access\r\nto the Church, and also (saving any established right of way) to the\r\nChurchyard, so that no one can lawfully exclude him from them, nor enter\r\nthem of their own right, but only by his permission, so long as\r\nIncumbent.”\r\n\r\nYet it is the Burial Board or the churchwardens who are to see that a\r\nburial-ground or a churchyard is kept “in decent order,” and to repair\r\nthe walls and fences; and if a churchyard is not kept in such order, or\r\nis used as a storing yard or for any other unsuitable purposes, both the\r\nincumbent and the churchwardens are evidently in fault. But although\r\nthere have been some cases of gross neglect the London churchyards have,\r\non the whole, been kept fairly well as far as the walls or fences and\r\nthe tombstones are concerned. A few have certainly degenerated into\r\nlittle less than rubbish heaps, but others have been maintained with\r\ngreat care. The Burial Boards have been conscientious in this respect\r\npretty generally over London, but there are not very many disused\r\nburial-grounds under the control of the Burial Boards. A few\r\nchurchyards, chiefly in the City, have been curtailed for the widening\r\nof roads, or altogether sacrificed for railways or new streets; a few\r\nadditional parochial burial-grounds have also disappeared, and a few,\r\nbut very few, have been misappropriated and let or sold as builders’\r\nyards, &c. The case was, however, far different, where an unconsecrated\r\nburial-ground was in private hands or belonged to three or four chapel\r\ntrustees, for then the temptation to raise money on it was very great.\r\nNearly all the private grounds and a large number of the Dissenters’\r\ngrounds were turned to account, as I have already shown in Chapters VII.\r\nand X.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTERSEA CHURCHYARD ABOUT 1830.]\r\n\r\nSo the churchyards remained, useless, closed and dreary, no one went\r\ninto them, the children gazed through the palings and their parents\r\ndeposited wastepaper, dead cats, rotten food, old clothes, &c., in them,\r\nand it was twenty years after they had been shut up before any of the\r\ndisused graveyards were converted into public gardens. It must, of\r\ncourse, be borne in mind that, when first closed, these grounds were\r\nvery unwholesome, but twenty years did, at any rate, a good deal towards\r\nameliorating their condition, and now that another twenty years have\r\npassed we may safely say that no evil effects can accrue from letting\r\npeople walk about in them, people, that is, who already live with these\r\ngrounds in their midst. And there is no more sure way of hastening their\r\nimprovement than by importing fresh soil and planting trees, shrubs and\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. JAMES’S, PENTONVILLE, IN JANUARY, 1896.]\r\n\r\nThe closing of the burial-grounds included the closing of the vaults.\r\nThere is hardly a church in London, and but few chapels, with a\r\ngraveyard attached, which had not also vaults used for interments under\r\nthe building, and there are many churches and chapels which had vaults\r\nbut not graveyards.\r\n\r\nThe earliest burials took place in the churchyards, the south side being\r\nalways the favourite. It seems originally to have been customary to bury\r\nonly stillborn infants, felons and suicides on the north side of the\r\nbuilding. It became a fashion of later times to bury in or under the\r\nchurch, and the first place used was the porch. But when once the custom\r\nwas established the inside of the church became the privileged place,\r\nand the most honoured dead were laid nearest the altar. The ancient\r\ncrypts, such as those at St. Bartholomew’s and Clerkenwell, were not, I\r\nimagine, originally intended for burying in, although coffins were put\r\nin them later on. But the vaults, such as those under the City churches\r\nand the parish churches outside the City, were expressly made for the\r\npurpose, a few having been used for beer or wine instead of bodies.\r\n\r\nMany vaults were private, such as “Lady Jersey’s Vault” and “Holden’s\r\nVault,” both in St. Bride’s, Fleet Street, and in this same church there\r\nis a “Doctor’s vault.” St. Clement Danes and other churches have a\r\n“Rector’s vault,” and St. Saviour’s, Southwark, can boast of a “Bishop’s\r\nvault.” The bodies from under some of the City churches which have been\r\npulled down were moved to others; the coffins from St. Michael, Crooked\r\nLane, were divided between St. Edmund King and Martyr and St. Mary\r\nWoolnoth, and those that went to the latter place have had a second\r\nremoval, the vaults having to be cleared out a few years ago. In many\r\nplaces there were vaults under the vestries, the adjoining schools,\r\nalmshouses, the sextons’ houses, &c., and at Lambeth, among the places\r\nof interment closed by order in Council, was a “vault under the\r\nstation-house.” A list of the London churches and chapels which were\r\nprovided with burial-vaults, but not with graveyards, will be found in\r\nAppendix C. It is not unlikely that many of these will have, in time, to\r\nbe cleared out. In some cases the coffins or remains have already been\r\ncollected and reinterred in cemeteries, the one at Woking having been\r\nespecially favoured. They are very liable to become a nuisance, and are\r\nfar more dangerous to the living than the human remains under the plots\r\nof ground open to the air.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n                     GRAVEYARDS AS PUBLIC GARDENS.\r\n\r\n    “Some young children sported among the tombs, and hid from each\r\n    other, with laughing faces. They had an infant with them, and had\r\n    laid it down asleep upon a child’s grave, in a little bed of\r\n    leaves.... Nell drew near and asked them whose grave it was. The\r\n    child answered that that was not its name; it was a garden—his\r\n    brother’s. It was greener, he said, than all the other gardens, and\r\n    the birds loved it better because he had been used to feed\r\n    them.”—_From the “Old Curiosity Shop_,” DICKENS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE late Sir Edwin Chadwick, in the Report which he drew up in 1843 (ten\r\nyears before the burial-grounds were closed), wrote the following\r\nsignificant words:—“The only observation I at present submit upon the\r\nspace of ground now occupied (as burial-grounds) is that it would serve\r\nhereafter advantageously to be kept open as public ground.” Happily he\r\nlived long enough to see some of these very graveyards upon which he had\r\nreported converted into open gardens. Their conversion and their\r\npreservation have gone hand in hand. Partly to facilitate their being\r\nacquired as open spaces an Act was framed, by the passing of which it\r\nbecame illegal to build on any ground that had been set aside for\r\ninterments. And there could be no better way of securing the\r\npreservation of a burial-ground from encroachment or misuse, than by\r\nlaying it out and handing it over to a public body to be maintained for\r\nthe benefit of the public under the Open Spaces Act. Once given to the\r\npeople, the people are not likely to give up an inch of it again without\r\na struggle.\r\n\r\nBy the year 1877 seven disused burial-grounds in London had been\r\nconverted into public gardens; those of St. Botolph’s, Bishopsgate, St.\r\nGeorge’s in the East, and the Wesleyan graveyard adjoining (forming one\r\nground), the additional ground for St. Martin’s in the Fields in Drury\r\nLane, St. John’s, Waterloo Bridge Road, and St. Pancras’ old churchyard,\r\nwith the adjoining graveyard belonging to St. Giles’ in the Fields\r\n(forming one ground). These may be called the five pioneer gardens. But\r\nSt. Botolph’s was closed again for several years, and St. Martin’s for a\r\nshort time, and St. Pancras’ and St. Giles’ had to have much more done\r\nto them before they became attractive open spaces, so that the one which\r\nreally stands out as the recreation ground that has had the longest\r\nexistence is St. George’s, for this has been in constant use for twenty\r\nyears. The Rev. Harry Jones, in his books, “East and West London,” and\r\n“Fifty Years,” describes the difficulties he went through to get the\r\nvestry to agree to the scheme, and to secure a faculty for laying out\r\nthe ground. He and his co-workers were in the Consistory Court for two\r\ndays, but they succeeded in the end, the wall between the churchyard and\r\nthe Nonconformist burial-ground was done away with, and a most valuable\r\nnew thoroughfare was opened out from Cable Street to St. George’s Street\r\n(Ratcliff Highway). Thus a precedent was created, and the way was made\r\neasier for others, including the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul’s, to lay\r\nout their churchyards. Since that time, 1875, the part adjoining the\r\nchurch has also been opened, the whole ground being about three acres in\r\narea, and it is always bright and neat and full of people enjoying the\r\nseats, the grass, the flowers, and the air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHURCHYARD OF ST. GEORGE’S IN THE EAST.]\r\n\r\nMr. Loftie has written: “Of St. George’s in the East there is not much\r\nto be said.” He refers to the church, but even this, one of Hawksmoor’s\r\nchief works, is rather too lightly disposed of. Of the parish there is\r\nindeed much to tell. No other church in London can boast of\r\nnineteenth-century riots continued Sunday after Sunday for eighteen\r\nmonths, necessitating the presence of police in the sacred building. No\r\nother parish ever contained a Danish and a Swedish church, with the\r\nbones of Emmanuel Swedenborg. St. George’s is in touch with all corners\r\nof the globe, for the London Docks contain countless stores of treasures\r\nfrom the east and the west, the north and the south. Here several of the\r\nchief of those commonly known as the “broad churchmen” of the day have\r\nserved as curates; and here the famous life of Father Lowder was lived\r\nfor twenty-four years, while the famous church of St. Peter’s, London\r\nDocks, arose in the southern part of the parish,—Father Lowder, of whom\r\nthe Rev. Harry Jones, in a memorial sermon, has said: “He was simply\r\nfearless.... He ever meant what he said, and said what he meant.... The\r\nmention of him meets the most sacred moods of the soul.” And the pioneer\r\ngarden is still unique in being an amalgamation of a churchyard and a\r\ndissenting burial-ground. How different it is from what it was once like\r\nmay be gathered from the following description in _Household Words_ of\r\nNovember 16, 1850: “The graveyard was dank and clayey, and air blew\r\ncoldly through the masts and rigging of the shipping moored in the\r\nThames and the Docks.” The curate comes to the parish, the curate who\r\neventually built Christ Church, Watney Street, dispirited and\r\ndiscouraged. He had fancied it was to St. George’s, Hanover Square, he\r\nwas going! And “the occasional funeral duty of the country was changed\r\nfor the constant day by day, week by week, repetitions of a gorged\r\nLondon graveyard,” to which “the close courts and poverty-stricken\r\nstreets of his parish sent every year many hundred tenants.” Then the\r\nchurchyard, like all the others in London, was closed, and became the\r\nusual useless cat-walk, with high walls around, and blackening\r\ntombstones, until the day when those negotiations began which resulted\r\nin the present charming garden. And this is a story which has now been\r\nrepeated in every division of London.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1882 the Earl of Meath (then Lord Brabazon) started the\r\nMetropolitan Public Gardens Association. It began on this wise. The\r\nKyrle Society and the National Health Society had each an Open Spaces\r\nsub-committee, Miss Octavia Hill, of the Kyrle Society, having always\r\nbeen a prominent supporter of the movement for promoting open spaces,\r\n“outdoor sitting-rooms” she called them, in poor districts. But the\r\nfunds of these committees were very small, and the work they could\r\naccomplish, except in the matter of influencing public opinion, very\r\nlimited. They made grants of seats to a few churchyards which were being\r\nlaid out, and joined in deputations to public bodies respecting open\r\nspaces, &c. Lord and Lady Brabazon had laid out the churchyards of St.\r\nJohn, Hoxton, and St. Mary, Haggerston, and had taken much interest in\r\nthe formation of other grounds, such as the Brewers’ Garden at Stepney,\r\nwhich mainly owed its existence to the Rev. Sydney Vatcher, present\r\nvicar of St. Philip’s; and Lord Brabazon felt that there was room and\r\nneed for a separate association for preserving, acquiring, and laying\r\nout open spaces, and for promoting similar objects. He therefore invited\r\nrepresentatives of the Kyrle and National Health Societies, and others\r\ninterested in the matter, to meet him and to discuss the advisability of\r\nsinking their own committees in a new and separate body, or rather of\r\namalgamating their efforts in the same direction. The National Health\r\nSociety only too gladly acquiesced, and from that time forward passed on\r\nall work connected with open spaces to the new body, Mr. Ernest Hart,\r\nChairman of their Council, becoming the first vice-chairman of the\r\nMetropolitan Public Gardens Association. There are now eighteen. But\r\nMiss Octavia Hill held back. And this is the reason why there is still\r\nan Open Spaces branch of the Kyrle Society, and why on the title-page of\r\nthe annual reports of the Gardens Association the words “In connection\r\nwith the National Health Society,” are always inserted. The following\r\ngraveyards have been laid out as gardens by the Kyrle Society in\r\nLondon—St. Peter’s, Bethnal Green, E., St. George’s, Bloomsbury, W. C.\r\n(the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association giving £100 towards the\r\nlaying out of each of these), St. George the Martyr, Bloomsbury, W.C.,\r\nand the burial-ground of St. Nicholas’, Deptford, in Wellington Street,\r\nS.E.—four very useful grounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHURCHYARD OF ST. BOTOLPH, ALDGATE.]\r\n\r\nThe new association was formed in November, 1882, and soon flourished\r\namazingly. By the end of 1895 it had carried through upwards of 320\r\nsuccessful undertakings, had 60 other works on hand, and had made offers\r\nand attempts, without success, respecting about 200 schemes. But the\r\nindirect work of the Association has also been most valuable; the tone\r\nof public opinion on the subject of open spaces has entirely changed\r\nduring the past twelve years, and this is due, in great measure, to the\r\nuntiring exertions of the Earl of Meath and his co-workers. New Acts of\r\nParliament, including the Disused Burial-grounds Act, have been passed,\r\nuseful clauses have been inserted in the Open Spaces Acts, and several\r\nBills threatening open spaces have been opposed and extinguished. The\r\nAssociation has worked with the Commons Preservation and Kyrle Societies\r\nto forward many most important schemes; it has secured, after much\r\nlabour, the opening on Saturdays of upwards of 200 Board School\r\nplaygrounds, and its influence upon the work of the public bodies has\r\nbeen wonderful. It is, for instance, scarcely too much to say that a\r\nweek seldom goes by without some communication passing between the\r\nAssociation and the London County Council.\r\n\r\nBut my subject is graveyards only, and the following is a list of those\r\nthat have been laid out as recreation grounds and opened by the\r\nMetropolitan Public Gardens Association since the Spring of 1885:—\r\n\r\n          1. St. Bartholomew’s Churchyard, Bethnal Green, E.\r\n          2. The East London Cemetery, E.\r\n          3. Holy Trinity Churchyard, Rotherhithe, S.E.\r\n          4. St. Paul’s Churchyard, Shadwell, E.\r\n          5. Spa Fields, Clerkenwell, E.C.\r\n          6. St. John at Hackney Churchyard, E. (a part).\r\n          7. St. Mary le Strand Ground in Russell Court, W.C.\r\n          8. St. James’s Churchyard, Bermondsey, S.E.\r\n          9. Holy Trinity Churchyard, Mile End, E.\r\n         10. St. Martin’s in the Fields Churchyard, W.C.\r\n         11. St. George’s Churchyard, Camberwell, S.E.\r\n         12. St. Dunstan’s Churchyard, Stepney, E.\r\n         13. St. Anne’s Churchyard, Limehouse, E.\r\n         14. Trinity Chapel-ground, Poplar, E.\r\n         15. St. Alphege Churchyard, Greenwich, S.E.\r\n         16. Seward Street Burial-ground, E.C.\r\n         17. St. James’s Churchyard, Ratcliff, E.\r\n         18. St. Botolph’s Churchyard, Aldgate, E.\r\n         19. St. Ann’s Churchyard, Soho, W.\r\n         20. Shoreditch Old Ground, Hackney Road, E.\r\n         21. Christ Church Churchyard, Spitalfields, E.\r\n         22. All Saints’ Churchyard, Poplar, E. (a part).\r\n         23. St. Botolph’s Churchyard, Bishopsgate, E.C.\r\n         24. St. Katharine Coleman Churchyard, E.C.\r\n         25. St. Olave’s Churchyard, Silver Street, E.C.\r\n         26. Victoria Park Cemetery, or Meath Gardens, E.\r\n         27. Allhallows’ Churchyard, London Wall, E.C.\r\n         28. St. Mary’s Churchyard, Bow, E. (a part).\r\n         29. St. Peter’s Churchyard, Walworth, S.E.\r\n         30. St. Mary’s Churchyard, Woolwich, S.E.[8]\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  The laying out of four more churchyards is in hand.\r\n\r\nThe other grounds laid out by the Association have been squares, vacant\r\nsites, and churchyards not used for interments. In addition to these,\r\ngrants have been given, amounting to many hundred pounds, towards the\r\nlaying out of some fourteen graveyards, and seats, &c., for another\r\ntwenty-eight, besides which the Association has secured the opening of\r\nmany more and has saved others from being built upon.\r\n\r\nOne year the income of the Association amounted to over £11,000. This\r\nwas due to a shower of wealth from the Mansion House Fund for the\r\nEmployment of the Unemployed. The Earl of Meath, at the Mansion House\r\nCommittee, boldly promised, with a smiling face and a sinking heart,\r\nthat if a grant were made to it the Association would find labour at\r\nonce and use up the money in wages. I remember being sent for to\r\nLancaster Gate in this emergency. It was no easy matter then and there\r\nto provide the work, and the money could not be spent on materials. But\r\nwithin a few weeks hundreds of men were employed, and their food\r\narranged for into the bargain. This process was repeated the following\r\nwinter (1887-8), but since then the Mansion House Funds have been\r\nsmaller and their distribution far more careful, while the Association\r\nhas had to depend for its income upon the subscriptions and donations of\r\nits members and friends.\r\n\r\nThere are now within the metropolitan area ninety burial-grounds\r\nactually dedicated to the public as recreation grounds, and being\r\nmaintained as such under the Open Spaces Act of 1881, or by trustees, or\r\nunder agreement with the vicar, &c., including four that are Board\r\nSchool playgrounds. To those who remember these places before they were\r\nconverted the transformation is wonderful. One Sunday in the year 1878,\r\nthe Rev. H. R. Haweis told his congregation at St. James’s, Westmoreland\r\nStreet, that in a hasty walk through their own parish burial-ground in\r\nPaddington Street, Marylebone, he had met “orange-peel, rotten eggs,\r\ncast-off hair-plaits, oyster-shells, crockery, newspapers with bread and\r\nmeat, dead cats and five live ones,” and that on the grave of one\r\nElizabeth Smith, “in the very centre of the churchyard,” he found\r\n“twelve old kettles, two coal-scuttles, three old hats, and an\r\numbrella.” Some of the congregation doubted it, but they went to look,\r\nand found it true. This particular ground was laid out as a garden by\r\nthe St. Marylebone Vestry in 1886, the Association providing £200 and\r\nthe wages of the labourers. I remember, in a paper I wrote some ten\r\nyears ago, describing a similar ground (and there were, and still are,\r\nmany such in London)—I think it was St. James’s, Clerkenwell. This is\r\nalso now a neat garden, towards the laying out of which, in 1890, the\r\nAssociation gave £50 and several seats.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CORNER OF ST. JOHN’S GARDEN, BENJAMIN STREET.]\r\n\r\nI have already referred, in previous chapters, to some of the more\r\ninteresting of the graveyards which have been laid out as open spaces.\r\nThere is a very charming little garden in Benjamin Street, near\r\nFarringdon Road, which belongs to the parish of St. John’s, Clerkenwell.\r\nIt was consecrated in 1755 by the Bishop of Lincoln, acting for the\r\nBishop of London, having been conveyed to trustees as an extra parochial\r\nburial-ground, the site being a gift to the parish by the will of Simon\r\nMichell, who died in 1750. After being closed for burials it fell into\r\nthe hands of a member of the Clerkenwell Vestry, and was covered with\r\nworkshops and rubbish until the then Rector, the Rev. W. Dawson,\r\ninstituted proceedings against him, secured the land, laid it out by\r\npublic subscription (in 1881), and maintained it at his private expense.\r\nIt is now in the hands of trustees, and the Holborn District Board of\r\nWorks and the Clerkenwell Vestry contribute towards its upkeep. Several\r\nother gardens in London have had a somewhat similarly checkered history.\r\nThe burial-ground in Hackney Road belonging to Shoreditch has a quaint\r\nold building in it, once the parish watch-house, and used as a temporary\r\nhospital at the time of the cholera visitation. A new-gateway has lately\r\nbeen made at St. James’s, Ratcliff, leading into the churchyard garden,\r\nerected as a memorial to the late vicar, the Rev. R. K. Arbuthnot, who\r\nspent very many years in the parish and died in harness. A special\r\nservice was held on November 30, 1895, when the choir walked in\r\nprocession through the grounds, the ceremony ending by the singing of\r\nthe Rev. H. R. Haweis’s hymn, “The Homeland.” The gate was dedicated by\r\nthe Rural Dean, Prebendary Turner, present Rector of St. George’s in the\r\nEast, and opened by Sir Walter Besant. Greenwich and Woolwich\r\nChurchyards, which were laid out by the Association, the cost of the\r\nlatter being borne by Mr. Passmore Edwards, are both fine gardens,\r\nWoolwich is especially attractive, as it stands high above the river,\r\nwith an extensive view. H.R.H. the Duke of Cambridge opened Greenwich\r\nChurchyard, and H.R.H. the Duchess of Fife opened that of Woolwich. St.\r\nJames’s Churchyard, Bermondsey, was extensively used for airing clothes\r\nbefore the Association laid it out.\r\n\r\nIn this matter of the conversion of churchyards into public gardens\r\nthere has, indeed, been a wonderful change in public opinion. It used to\r\nbe necessary to visit the clergy and to ask them to allow the grounds to\r\nbe laid out, with the result, usually, that the request or offer was\r\ndeclined. But a new race of clergy seems to be springing up, and such\r\nmen as the present Rectors of Woolwich, Walworth, and Bethnal Green no\r\nsooner came into possession of their livings than they wrote to the\r\nAssociation, begging that their churchyards might be taken in hand. The\r\nnew Rector of Bethnal Green, already well known as the “head” of Oxford\r\nHouse, not only asked the Association to lay out his churchyard but also\r\nmade a Christmas present of it to the Vestry, and ere long it will be a\r\nmost useful open space. And this has happened in very many places, most\r\nof the parish churchyards being new public gardens, except Camberwell,\r\nRotherhithe, Battersea, Clapham, Wandsworth, Kensington, Wapping,\r\nHomerton, and a few others; but there are still several district\r\nchurchyards which it would be very advantageous to lay out.\r\n\r\nTo return to some of the quainter spots. In the burial-ground of St.\r\nGeorge the Martyr, Bloomsbury, there stands a private gentleman’s\r\ndissecting-room. Hackney Churchyard includes the ground surrounding the\r\ntower of the older church (St. Augustine’s), while Bermondsey Churchyard\r\nincludes the cemetery of the Abbey. The little playground in Russell\r\nCourt, Drury Lane, which was a graveyard attached to the parish of St.\r\nMary le Strand, is immortalised as “Tom all alones” in Dickens’ “Bleak\r\nHouse.” This was “that there berryin’ ground,” where, said poor Jo,\r\n“‘they laid him as was werry good to me’”—the place “with houses looking\r\non on every side, save where a reeking little tunnel of a court gives\r\naccess to the iron gate....\r\n\r\n“‘He was put there,’ says Jo, holding to the bar and looking in.\r\n\r\n“‘Where? Oh, what a scene of horror!’\r\n\r\n“‘There,’ says Jo, pointing, ‘over yinder—among them piles of bones, and\r\nclose to that there kitchen winder! ... Look at the rat! Hi! Look! There\r\nhe goes! Ho! into the ground.’”\r\n\r\nWhen the Association got hold of it, it was little else than a heap of\r\ndecaying rubbish thrown from the surrounding houses, and the carcases of\r\neighteen cats were removed at once. It is now an asphalted recreation\r\nground, and is often crowded with children using the swings and the\r\nseats. But it has lately lost its characteristic appearance, the\r\nsurrounding houses have been pulled down, and it is at present “opened\r\nout.” The “kitchen winder” no longer leads into a kitchen, though the\r\niron gate is still in its original state, with the worn step upon which\r\nLady Deadlock’s life was brought to a close.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that there has been no opposition to the\r\nconversion of graveyards into public gardens. Many owners have refused\r\nto allow it, and from time to time (though the times are now getting\r\nvery few and far between) letters have been written to the newspapers\r\npointing out the danger of admitting the public into them. But the\r\nburial-grounds are there—in the midst of crowded streets—whether we like\r\nthem or no, and they become far more wholesome when fresh soil is\r\nimported, good gravel paths made, and the ground drained, and when\r\ngrass, flowers, trees, and shrubs take the place of the rotting rubbish.\r\nA certain gentleman, somewhat well known, wrote on several occasions to\r\nthe _Times_, arguing against the laying out of churchyards, and saying\r\nthat a “blue haze” hung about a square in New York which once was a\r\nburial-ground. But no blue haze hangs about our gardens in London,\r\nchildren are born and bred by the hundred in those very kitchens whose\r\n“winders” look upon them, and they are of the utmost value as open\r\nspaces in all parts of the town.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHURCHYARD OF ALLHALLOWS, LONDON WALL.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, every consideration should be shown for those whose\r\nobjections to the transformation have been on sentimental grounds. In\r\nAppendix D will be seen the steps to be taken for laying out and\r\nthrowing open to the public a disused churchyard or burial-ground, and\r\nfrom this those who are not already aware of it may notice two\r\npoints—first, that any person interested in any particular tombstone has\r\nthe right and the power to prevent such tombstone from being moved;\r\nsecond, that the inscriptions on the stones, and their exact positions\r\nin a ground to be laid out, are preserved in perpetuity in the office of\r\nthe Registrar of the Diocese; whereas the actual inscriptions themselves\r\non the tombstones, whether a ground is closed, or open, are daily\r\nbecoming more defaced, and when it is closed there is no such record of\r\nthem and no guarantee that they may not be broken, shifted, or stolen.\r\nNor must it be imagined that the tombstones in all graveyard gardens\r\nhave necessarily to be moved. It is only where they are standing so\r\nthickly that the ground cannot be laid out otherwise. In some places,\r\nsuch as Spa Fields, not a single gravestone existed when it came into\r\nthe hands of the Association; in others, such as St. Mary le Strand,\r\nthere were only a few and these already on the walls; while in others,\r\nagain, such as Holy Trinity, Rotherhithe, there were so few that it was\r\nnot necessary to get a faculty to remove them, but they were left _in\r\nsitu_. There is rather an amusing tombstone at All Saints’, Poplar. It\r\nstands tall and solitary in the middle of a path, which could not be\r\ndiverted because of other stones; and when the path was made this\r\nparticular monument was left in the very centre. I think the best way of\r\ndisposing of tombstones is by putting them against the walls, even if it\r\nnecessitates two or three rows. They are very dismal standing in groups,\r\nas at St. James’s, Hampstead Road, and the wall of headstones at St.\r\nLuke’s, Chelsea, is by no means attractive. Nor are the “dome” and\r\n“trophy” at St. Pancras, to which I have already referred. In St. John’s\r\nGarden, Horseferry Road, they are cemented into an even row against the\r\nwall, and look as if they would last for ever.\r\n\r\nI would not say that a converted graveyard is a better garden than a\r\nconverted square, but yet there is something more interesting about\r\nit—it is so very human; and where there are monuments to notable persons\r\n(which naturally are undisturbed) they form something with an historical\r\nflavour about it which is attractive to look at. At Paddington\r\nChurchyard, for instance, there is the grave of Mrs. Siddons, in front\r\nof which it is said that Miss Mary Anderson, during her first tour in\r\nEngland, was often seen to stand.\r\n\r\n“Isn’t it foine!” said a ragged little urchin to me on the day when that\r\nparticular ground was thrown open to the public. He was simply bursting\r\nwith delight at having a garden to go into. I answered that I thought it\r\nwas. This reminds me of another little denizen of the slums, at\r\nLincoln’s Inn Fields. He was inside—I had just left the ground after the\r\nopening ceremony. He peeped through the railings, overflowing with\r\nsmiles; “You can come _in_, Miss,” he said. I was not a Miss, but I\r\nthanked him for the information.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THE GRAVEYARD OF ST. JOHN’S IN HORSEFERRY ROAD.]\r\n\r\nApart from the question of the moving of tombstones, there are many\r\npeople who think it irreverent for a ground once used for burial ever to\r\nbe used for recreation; they do not like the idea of people walking\r\nabout over the graves. This feeling is worthy of all respect. It is\r\nfound largely developed among the Jews, and has prevented them,\r\nhitherto, from allowing any of their graveyards to be laid out as public\r\ngardens. There are other people—and I am thankful that I do not come\r\nacross them—who would like our churches turned into theatres and our\r\nchurchyards into “Tivolis.” They do far more harm to the cause of open\r\nspaces than do those who are slow to adapt themselves to modern ideas.\r\nBut as far as my experience goes, I have found that the people who\r\nchiefly object to the conversion of burial-grounds into gardens are\r\nthose who stay at home. They have in their mind’s eye a picture of a\r\nwell-kept cemetery, where burials take place every day, or of a sweet\r\nvillage churchyard, where the grass is soft and green and the graves are\r\npeaceful and undisturbed. One of the last things that I should ever wish\r\nto see is a village churchyard turned into the village recreation\r\nground; and it was sad to find as I did a short time ago, that a certain\r\nrural churchyard in West Middlesex was being used as a drying-ground for\r\nclean clothes. But the London disused graveyards are _so_ different,\r\nthat I believe it is only necessary to take these objectors (though they\r\nwill never come) into a neglected ground, to point out to them the\r\nsinking graves, to help them to pick their way so that they may avoid\r\nthe dirty rubbish lying about, and the pitfalls into which they may\r\nstumble, in order to convince them that the ground, if turned into a\r\npublic garden, would be treated with more reverence and in a more seemly\r\nmanner. Then show them a graveyard garden; let them sit there for a bit\r\nto watch the people who come in and out, the men who have a brief rest\r\nin the middle of the day, the women who can snatch a few moments from\r\ntheir crowded and noisy homes, the big children with the “prams,” and\r\nthe little children they have in charge—and the change in the minds of\r\nthe objectors will be complete.\r\n\r\nThe laying out of the churchyards is being carried out in many large\r\ntowns besides London, though the initiative came from the metropolis.\r\nLiverpool, Leeds, Birmingham, Glasgow, and other places are adopting the\r\nplan, and in Norwich there is a young and flourishing Open Space Society\r\nwhich has already done much in this direction. As the City of Norwich\r\ncontains about fifty churches, nearly all of which have churchyards, the\r\nSociety has its work cut out for it, in this one way alone, for a good\r\nmany years.\r\n\r\nMy impression is that amongst the London burial-grounds which are still\r\nclosed and useless, there are fewer very untidy ones than there used to\r\nbe. The agitation that has led to the laying out of 80 or 90 as public\r\nrecreation grounds has also had a beneficial effect upon those which are\r\nnot yet laid out. If this is the case it is very satisfactory, and it is\r\nan indirect result of the labours of the members of the Metropolitan\r\nPublic Gardens Association, and of others who have interested themselves\r\nin the matter, which should be a cause for thankfulness and\r\nencouragement.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n                      THE CEMETERIES STILL IN USE.\r\n\r\n           “With thy rude ploughshare, Death, turn up the sod,\r\n             And spread the furrow for the seed we sow;\r\n           This is the field and acre of our God,\r\n             This is the place where human harvests grow.”\r\n                                          LONGFELLOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nBESIDES the churchyards of Tooting, Plumstead, Lee, and Eltham, that are\r\nstill available for interments, and some others, such as Charlton and\r\nFulham, where burials in existing graves or vaults are sanctioned on\r\napplication to the Home Secretary, ten burial-grounds, which can hardly\r\nbe called cemeteries, are still being used in London. These are the\r\nSouth Street or Garratt’s Lane ground at Wandsworth, consecrated in\r\n1808, where widows, widowers, and parents of deceased persons already\r\ninterred there can be buried, and the Holly Lane ground in Hampstead,\r\nwhich was consecrated in 1812, and is occasionally used; the graveyard\r\nby the Friends’ Meeting-House in Stoke Newington, those in the convents\r\nin King Street, Hammersmith, and Portobello Road, and one in Newgate\r\nGaol (to all of which I have referred); and a burial-ground crowded with\r\ntombstones behind St. Thomas’ Roman Catholic Church in Fulham, where new\r\ngraves are still dug, although there appears to be no room for more\r\nmonuments, and although densely-populated streets are on every side. The\r\nother three are Jewish grounds, one in Ball’s Pond, N., and two in Mile\r\nEnd, E., and they are described in Chapter VIII.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that when the Act was passed, under which the\r\nmetropolitan burial-grounds were to be closed, seven of the new\r\ncemeteries were already in use, and while the burial-grounds were being\r\nclosed, other cemeteries were being started.\r\n\r\nThe Act for the formation of Kensal Green Cemetery was passed in 1832,\r\nafter unremitting efforts on the part of Mr. G. F. Carden. It is\r\nsituated by the Harrow Road, not far short of Willesden Junction, and\r\nwhen first made was practically in the country. Now it is in the midst\r\nof large colonies of small houses. It has, as is usual, a consecrated\r\nand an unconsecrated portion, with a chapel in each. Its establishment\r\nled the way to the formation of other cemeteries, but most of the later\r\nones were acquired by the parishes, not started by companies.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the large cemeteries which have thus sprung into existence\r\nare just outside the metropolitan area, but the following are within the\r\nboundary of the County of London, and are tabulated in the order in\r\nwhich they were established:—\r\n\r\n   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────┬───────┬────────\r\n                                                    │       │DATE OF\r\n                     NAME OF CEMETERY.              │  SIZE │ FIRST\r\n                                                    │  IN   │ INTER-\r\n                                                    │ACRES. │ MENT.\r\n   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────┼───────┼────────\r\n    1.

The inhabitants of the districts in which it was\r\nproposed to place them naturally petitioned against their formation. A\r\nhuge scheme for securing ninety-two acres (the Roundwood Farm Estate),\r\nbetween Willesden and Harlesden, for the Great Extramural Cemetery\r\nAssociation, was opposed by the Middlesex magistrates and others, and\r\nwas not sanctioned by the Secretary of State. Part of this site is now a\r\npublic park. The parish of Kensington applied for permission to form a\r\ncemetery of thirty acres at Wormwood SCRUBS, but had eventually to go as\r\nfar out of London as Hanwell in order to secure a suitable plot.\r\nUnfortunately some public land was allotted. I believe that Norwood\r\nCemetery was formerly a part of Norwood Common, and Putney and Barnes\r\nCemeteries (the latter being just outside the boundary of London) are on\r\nPutney and Barnes Commons. The cemetery at Tooting was once meadow-land\r\nknown as Baggery Mead, and for most of the others farm land and fields\r\nwere taken. Happily it would now be very difficult to acquire a piece of\r\ncommon or lammas land for any such purpose, as we know far better than\r\nwe did how to preserve our greatest treasures. How disastrous it would\r\nbe if, when our village churchyards could no longer be used, the village\r\ngreens were turned into burial-grounds!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NORWOOD CEMETERY ABOUT 1851.]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying picture of Norwood Cemetery was published in 1851, and\r\nshows a single row of tombstones by the paths. Now there is row upon row\r\nbehind these, the place seems to be entirely filled, and “yet there is\r\nroom.” These grounds are all much alike, but Norwood is peculiar in\r\ncontaining a small parochial burial-ground belonging to St. Mary at\r\nHill, in the City (the church of the Church Army), and another belonging\r\nto the Greeks. Most dwellers in London are acquainted with one or other\r\nof the cemeteries, some people finding pleasure in walking about in\r\nthem, and sitting on the seats provided for visitors among the tombs;\r\nand they are, on the whole, well looked after and neatly kept. It is\r\nrather to be regretted that the custom of putting quaint and interesting\r\nepitaphs on the stones is so entirely a thing of the past; the\r\nmonotonous texts do not take their place at all.\r\n\r\nThere is a special interest attached to Kensal Green Cemetery from its\r\nhaving been the first, but I think it is also the worst. Mr. Loftie\r\ndescribes it as “the bleakest, dampest, most melancholy of all the\r\nburial-grounds of London.” I doubt if it is the dampest, though the soil\r\nis a heavy clay, for I think that the Tower Hamlets Cemetery is probably\r\nfar damper. Nor is Kensal Green so overcrowded or untidy as the Tower\r\nHamlets, where gravestones are tumbling and lying about, apparently\r\nunclaimed and uncared for, amongst dead shrubs and rank grass; it has\r\nalso not quite so large a proportion of “common graves” (for eight\r\nbodies or so), as there are in some of the other grounds, and the number\r\nof burials per acre has not been quite so enormous as, for instance, at\r\nTooting, Brompton, or Abney Park. The last-named ground, when it had\r\nonly been opened fifteen years, was described in an official report as\r\nbeing “a mass of corruption underneath,” the soil being a “damp, blue\r\nclay.” But Kensal Green Cemetery is truly awful, with its catacombs, its\r\nhuge mausoleums, family vaults, statues, broken pillars, weeping images,\r\nand oceans of tombstones, good, bad, and indifferent. I think the\r\nindifferent are to be preferred, the bad should not be anywhere, and the\r\ngood are utterly out of place. It is also the largest in the metropolis,\r\nand as the Roman Catholic ground joins it there are in this spot, or\r\nthere very soon will be, ninety-nine acres of dead bodies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TOMB OF PRINCESS SOPHIA.]\r\n\r\nThere are many sad sights in London, but to me there are few so sad as\r\none of these huge graveyards. Not that the idea of the numbers of dead\r\nbeneath the soil produces any thoughts of melancholy, but I feel\r\ninclined to exclaim with the disciples, “To what purpose is this waste?”\r\nCan there be any more profitless mode of throwing away money than by\r\nerecting costly tombstones? They are of no use to the departed, and they\r\nare grievous burdens laid on the shoulders of succeeding generations.\r\nThe only people who profit by them are a few marble and granite\r\nmerchants, and a few monumental masons—and they might be better\r\nemployed. The whole funeral system is an extravagant imposition, and has\r\nbeen for years. It may be said that the heavy trappings, the plumes, the\r\nscarves, &c., are going out of fashion; and this is true, but other\r\nthings are taking their place. I saw the other day a neat little copy of\r\nthe Burial Service, bound in black leather, with a cross outside. On the\r\nfly leaf was printed the name of the person to be buried, with the date\r\nof death, place of interment, &c. This book was given by the undertaker\r\nto each of those who attended the funeral, and as the ceremony was\r\nconducted by a Nonconformist minister, who arranged it in accordance\r\nwith his own individual predilection, the little book was useless! I\r\nmerely mention this as a specimen of the way in which the expenses of a\r\nmodern funeral may be mounted up. The rich lavish their money on costly,\r\nalmost indestructible coffins, which it would be far better to do\r\nwithout altogether, and on masses of flowers that die unseen, while the\r\npoor go into debt to buy mourning, which they often pawn before a month\r\nis over; and many a widow and family, who have a hard struggle to\r\nprovide daily food, deny themselves the necessities of life, and sow the\r\nseeds of disease and want, in order to set up a tombstone or monument on\r\na grave. And who sees it? A few people may occasionally go to Kensal\r\nGreen to look at the tomb of Princess Sophia, the family mausoleum of\r\nthe Duke of Cambridge, or the monuments erected to the Duke of Sussex,\r\nThackeray, Mulready, Tom Hood, George Cruikshank (whose body has been\r\nremoved to St. Paul’s Cathedral), Leigh Hunt, John Leech, Hugh\r\nLittlejohn, or Sydney Smith; but they are utterly spoilt by their\r\nsurroundings. It is hardly possible to appreciate such memorials when\r\nthey are closely hedged in by others in all descriptions of stone, of\r\nall shapes and sizes, and in all styles of architecture. And it is\r\nappalling to think of the amount of money that has been spent on these\r\nmassive monuments. How many a church or chapel might have been built in\r\na growing district; how many a beautiful old church now falling to decay\r\nmight have been restored[9]; how many missionaries might have been sent\r\nto foreign lands; how many hospital beds might have been endowed; how\r\nmany struggling families, or sick members of the same, might have been\r\ngiven a holiday in the country or by the sea; how many open spaces might\r\nhave been secured and laid out for the people; how many drinking\r\nfountains might have been erected; how many grants might have been made\r\nto voluntary schools or secular institutions for benefiting mankind; and\r\nhow many objects of real beauty and antiquarian interest might have been\r\npreserved! It is impossible to give an answer to these questions—perhaps\r\none would be sadder still if one could.\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  Four English Cathedrals are at the present time in urgent need of\r\n  funds for restoration.\r\n\r\nThe Jews think a great deal of their tombstones, and erect very large\r\nones. When one is “set up” they have a special ceremony, which they\r\nadvertise beforehand, and the friends and relations gather at the grave.\r\nI have already referred to the very different custom of the Society of\r\nFriends—the Quakers—and I trust that they may long preserve the\r\nsimplicity of their burial practices, for “it consorts not with our\r\nprinciples,” said W. Beck and T. F. Ball, in their history of the London\r\nFriends’ Meetings (1869), “unduly to exalt the honoured dead; their\r\nnames we canonise not, and o’er their graves we raise no costly\r\nmonument.” It has been the dying wish of very many of our best men that\r\ntheir bodies might be laid to rest in quietness, and without undue\r\nexpense or show. Unfortunately their wishes have not always been carried\r\nout. Sir John Morden, who founded Morden College or Almshouses for\r\ndecayed Merchants, in Blackheath, left directions in his will that he\r\nshould be interred in the chapel of the college “without any pomp or\r\nsinging boys, but decently.” I do not think the singing boys would have\r\nhurt him, but his wish to dispense with “pomp” was most praiseworthy.\r\nHis funeral _was_ made the occasion of a considerable ceremony, but, as\r\nit took place at 9 o’clock in the evening, perhaps it was unaccompanied\r\nby such an institution as a champagne lunch. His name and his fame have\r\nsurvived by reason of the noble work he did, There is a deep lesson in\r\nSir Christopher Wren’s epitaph in St. Paul’s Cathedral:—\r\n\r\n                  “Si momentum requiris circumspice.”\r\n\r\nLongfellow sang the same strain in his well-known verses:—\r\n\r\n                “Alike are life and death\r\n                   When life in death survives,\r\n                 And the interrupted breath\r\n                   Inspires a thousand lives.\r\n\r\n                 Were a star quenched on high,\r\n                   For ages would its light,\r\n                 Still travelling downward from the sky,\r\n                   Shine on our mortal sight.\r\n\r\n                 So when a good man dies,\r\n                   For years beyond our ken,\r\n                 The light he leaves behind him lies\r\n                   Upon the paths of men.”\r\n\r\nAnd it is reiterated still more beautifully in the touching conversation\r\nbetween the schoolmaster and Little Nell in Dickens’ “Old Curiosity\r\nShop,” towards the close of the fifty-fourth chapter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN KENSAL GREEN CEMETERY.]\r\n\r\nI cannot conclude this division of my subject without an earnest appeal\r\nto those who are contemplating erecting a tombstone to the memory of a\r\nbeloved relation or friend, to consider beforehand which is the wisest\r\nway of commemorating the departed,—whether the simplest memorial is not\r\nafter all the best, “for sublimity always is simple,” whether it may not\r\nbe better still to have none at all in a cemetery already overcrowded\r\nwith monuments, and whether it is well to add indefinitely to the\r\nforests of practically imperishable gravestones which are gradually\r\nsurrounding London and our other large towns.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n                       A FORECAST OF THE FUTURE.\r\n\r\n                    “Now our sands are almost run:\r\n                     More or little, and then dumb.”\r\n                                  SHAKESPEARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI ACKNOWLEDGE a hesitation in writing this chapter, because there are\r\nmany people who feel very strongly upon the subject of the disposal of\r\nthe dead, and whose feelings I wish in no way to appear to treat with\r\nanything but the greatest consideration.\r\n\r\nThe custom of burying the body has been in practice in England ever\r\nsince Christianity was established here, and so completely did burial\r\ntake the place of burning that the latter expedient has never been\r\nformally forbidden, or, until 1884, even referred to, in English law. It\r\nis well that this fact should be clearly understood, viz., that it is\r\nnot illegal to dispose of a dead body by other means than by burial in\r\nearth (unless it should be proved a public nuisance at common law), nor\r\nhas it been illegal in England in the past, but it has merely not been\r\nthe custom, “inhumation” having been systematically practised for a\r\nthousand years.\r\n\r\nIt is natural that many beautiful thoughts should have been expressed by\r\nour greatest writers in connection with the burial of the dead; it has\r\nbeen a theme upon which poets have loved to dwell. The mourners, the\r\nlych-gate, the weather-worn stones, the solemn stillness, the\r\nyew-tree—they all furnish subjects for reflection and for verse.\r\nTennyson refers in terms of tenderest meaning to the yew-tree in the\r\nchurchyard in his “In Memoriam,” and even Tom Hood puts aside his joking\r\nmood when he thinks of it—\r\n\r\n                “How wide the yew-tree spreads its gloom,\r\n                 And o’er the dead lets fall its dew,\r\n                 As if in tears it wept for them,\r\n                 The many human families\r\n                 That sleep around its stem!”\r\n\r\nI confess I love these associations dearly, and it would be hard indeed\r\nto give them up. But will they ever cling around our cemeteries? I think\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, many very curious notions have arisen in connection\r\nwith this subject—notions as groundless as they are quaint. I will\r\nmention three only, which are illustrated by the two following epitaphs,\r\nthe first of which is from St. Olave’s, Jewry, and the second from\r\nBermondsey, as quoted by Maitland:—\r\n\r\n        1. “Under this Tomb, the sacred Ashes hold,\r\n          The drossie Part of more celestiall Gold;\r\n          The Body of a Man, a Man of Men,\r\n          Whose worth to write at large, would loose my Pen.\r\n          Then do thy worst, Death, glut thyself with Dust,\r\n          The precious Soul is mounted to the Just.\r\n          Yet, Reader, when thou read’st, both read and weep,\r\n          That Men so good, so grave, so wise, do sleep.”\r\n\r\n        2. “Where once the famous _Elton_ did entrust\r\n          The Preservation of his sacred Dust,\r\n          Lyes pious _Whitaker_, both justly twined,\r\n          Both dead one Grave, both living had one Mind;\r\n          And by their dissolution have supply’d\r\n          The hungry Grave, and Fame and Heaven beside.\r\n          This stone protect their Bones, while Fame enrolls\r\n          Their deathless Name, and Heaven embrace their Souls.”\r\n\r\nIn the first we are told to weep because so good a man has gone, from\r\nthe second we are led to believe that the gravestone protects the body\r\nof the departed, and both contain the idea that the grave or earth is\r\nanxious to receive the mortal remains, and is more comfortable for\r\nhaving done so. First there is the question of the weeping. It is very\r\nusual, on gravestones and monuments, to find the order given to the\r\nreader to “drop a tear.” And yet how impossible it is to carry it out.\r\nImagine dropping a tear all along a line of graves of people of whom one\r\nhas never heard, and who died 250 years ago! But happily there are quite\r\nas many injunctions to the contrary, and we are as often told not to\r\nweep:—\r\n\r\n          “Weep not for me, friends, though death us do sever,\r\n           I’m going to do nothing for ever and ever.”\r\n\r\nThis epitaph to a poor overworked woman is, perhaps, flippant. Here is a\r\nmore serious one, which was in the church of St. Martin Outwich:—\r\n\r\n           “Reader, thou may’st forbear to put thine Eyes\r\n            To charge For Tears, to mourn these Obsequies:\r\n            Such charitable Drops would best be given\r\n            To those who late, or never, come to Heaven.\r\n            But here you would, by weeping on this Dust,\r\n            Allay his Happiness with thy Mistrust;\r\n            Whose pious closing of his youthful Years\r\n            Deserves thy Imitation, not thy Tears.”\r\n                           (_In memory of John Wight_, 1633.)\r\n\r\nSecondly there is the question of the protecting gravestone. This is\r\nalso not uncommonly met with. The poet Gray’s well-known “Elegy in a\r\nCountry Churchyard” contains the following verse:—\r\n\r\n          “Yet e’en these bones from insult to protect\r\n             Some frail memorial still erected nigh,\r\n           With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture decked,\r\n             Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.”\r\n\r\nBut there could be few notions more false. Gravestones have often enough\r\nbeen “moved about to give more appearance of room,” and oftener still\r\ncleared away altogether, while the bodies beneath have been cast out\r\nalmost as soon as they were buried; and unfortunately there are many\r\ncountry churchyards now which are terribly overcrowded. A short time\r\nafter the death of Lawrence Sterne his admirers collected money to put a\r\nmonument on his grave in St. George’s burial-ground, Bayswater Road. It\r\nwas erected in what was supposed to be about the right position—no one\r\ncould point to the exact spot where the body lay.\r\n\r\nThirdly we have the idea of the hungering grave, which is carried to a\r\nridiculous point in this passage from “The Wonderful Yeare 1603, wherein\r\nis shewed the picture of London lying sicke of the Plague.”—“Let us look\r\nforth, and try what consolation rises with the sun. Not any, not any;\r\nfor, before the jewel of the morning be fully set in silver, hundred\r\nhungry graves stand gaping; and every one of them (as at a breakfast)\r\nhath swallowed downe ten or eleven lifeless carcases. Before dinner, in\r\nthe same gulfe, are twice so many more devoured. And, before the Sun\r\ntakes his rest, those numbers are doubled.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHEEP IN THE SAVOY CHURCHYARD ABOUT 1825.]\r\n\r\nNow the grave is not hungry, and the earth does not want dead bodies; it\r\nis better without them. Yet, strangely enough, there is a certain\r\nbenefit to be derived from a moderate supply, and the most advanced\r\ncremationists advocate the use of the few remaining ashes as manure for\r\nsome kinds of farm lands. Sir Henry Thompson, a cremationist worthy of\r\nevery honour, has referred to the great increase there would be in the\r\nfish supply if burial at sea were generally practised, a plan approved\r\nof by some _anti_-cremationists. We have seen that churchyard water has\r\nbeen drunk for generations, and very bad it is. Churchyard poultry and\r\nchurchyard mutton are also common enough, many a poor parson being glad\r\nto earn a few pounds in the year by allowing sheep to graze among the\r\ngraves. This is all very well in some country places, but it used to be\r\npractised in London, and sheep have been actually killed by swallowing\r\nwith the grass the poisonous products of the overfilled ground. In the\r\nCharterhouse graveyard there are some magnificent wall fruit trees, such\r\nas are seldom seen in crowded towns; one of the Stepney pest-fields\r\nbecame a market-garden; while breweries and burial-grounds seem to be\r\nclosely associated with each other.\r\n\r\nBut the question of paramount importance is how to stop the increase of\r\ncemeteries. Are we ever to allow England to be divided like a\r\nchess-board into towns and burial-places? What we have to consider is\r\nhow to dispose of the dead without taking so much valuable space from\r\nthe living. In the metropolitan area alone we have almost filled (and in\r\nsome places overfilled) twenty-four new cemeteries within sixty years,\r\nwith an area of above six hundred acres; and this is as nothing compared\r\nwith the huge extent of land used for interments just outside the limits\r\nof the metropolis. If the cemeteries are not to extend indefinitely they\r\nmust in time be built upon, or they must be used for burial over and\r\nover again, or the ground must revert to its original state as\r\nagricultural land, or we must turn our parks and commons into\r\ncemeteries, and let our cemeteries be our only recreation grounds—which\r\nHeaven forbid!\r\n\r\nI fail to understand how any serious-minded person can harbour the idea\r\nthat burning the body can be any stumbling-block in the way of its\r\nresurrection, for the body returns “earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust\r\nto dust,” whether the process takes fifty years or fifty minutes. But\r\nmany people have a horror of the notion—they know it is sanitary, but\r\nthey think it irreverent. There are other alternatives, worthy of\r\ncareful consideration. Some have advocated burial at sea; others, and\r\namong them Sir Seymour Haden, have pressed forward the advantages of\r\nusing perishable coffins, wicker baskets, and the like—a suggestion as\r\nexcellent as it is economical, for the sooner the earth and the body\r\nmeet the better it is. Perhaps, in this scientific generation, some one\r\nmay invent a totally new method of disposing of the dead, which will\r\ncommend itself both to those who advocate cremation and to those who\r\ndislike it. He would indeed be a public benefactor, deserving of the\r\nFaraday medal. But that cremation is on the increase cannot be denied.\r\nEven Kensal Green Cemetery has now a “Columbarium,” which is an elegant\r\nname for pigeon-holes for cinerary urns, built in 1892, with forty-two\r\nlittle cupboards. Since the decision of Mr. Justice Stephen in the case\r\nof Dr. William Price, in February, 1884, it has been recognised as legal\r\nin England, and the crematoriums at Woking and elsewhere have been\r\nfrequently used. But if the practice is to become at all general it must\r\nbe advocated by a different set of people. It has, to a certain extent,\r\nhappened hitherto that those who have been cremated have been more or\r\nless associated (I hope I may not be misunderstood here) with the\r\nadvanced school—those that consider themselves “enlightened,” Radicals,\r\nor Socialists, or persons of little or no professed religious views.\r\nThis was not the case with the promoters of cremation, but it has been\r\nso with some of their disciples, or at any rate many anti-cremationists\r\nthink so. The Rev. H. R. Haweis is excellent in his way—I speak of him\r\nwith the greatest respect—but I venture to think that cremation will not\r\nbe taken up very largely until a few such men as the Archbishop of York,\r\nthe Chief Rabbi, the Rev. Prebendary Webb Peploe, and Father Staunton\r\npronounce in its favour. Then it would soon be necessary to have a\r\ncrematorium in every cemetery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COLUMBARIUM AT KENSAL GREEN.]\r\n\r\nIt is morbid and useless to make previous preparation for death, except\r\nby life insurance, a proper will, and other business-like arrangements\r\nfor the benefit of survivors. It is foolish to erect, as many have done,\r\na tomb during lifetime (like the Miller’s tomb on Highdown Hill,\r\nSussex), to keep a coffin under the bed, or to have a picture of a\r\nskeleton always on the wall. Such eccentric practices as that of the\r\ngentleman who died in a house by Hyde Park, and, at his wish, had his\r\nbody kept in a coffin under a glass case on the roof of the house, are\r\nnot to be admired. We can never forget that our life here will have its\r\nending, our friends, companions, and neighbours are constantly leaving\r\nus, our daily paper has its daily obituary column, and surely no\r\nartificial method is needed to remind us of this fact. Cowper has said:\r\n\r\n                  “Like crowded forest-trees we stand,\r\n                     And some are marked to fall;\r\n                   The axe will smite at God’s command,\r\n                     And soon shall smite us all.”\r\n\r\nThe utmost we need do, if we do not want our bodies to rest in the\r\ncemeteries, is to tell our friends that we wish them cremated, or buried\r\nin perishable coffins, or quietly laid in some far-off, rural spot. All\r\nelse we may leave—it is in higher hands than ours; and already the\r\nChurch on earth, imperfect, faulty, and divided though she be, has\r\n\r\n                       “mystic, sweet communion\r\n                     With those whose rest is won.”\r\n\r\nA few words in closing about the future of the disused burial-grounds in\r\nLondon. I think they are tolerably safe now. I have attempted to show\r\nhow many there still are, closed and idle, or being used for a totally\r\nwrong purpose, between Hampstead and Plumstead, Hammersmith and Bow; but\r\nthey are surely, if but slowly, being reclaimed and changed, one by one,\r\ninto places of rest and recreation for the living. The public mind has\r\nso far awaked to the necessity of securing all the breathing-spaces\r\nwhich may be had, that the smallest corner of land in which interments\r\ncan have been said to have taken place now forms a subject of litigation\r\nif attempts are made to build upon it. Preservation is the first step\r\nupon the ladder, acquisition the next, while conversion crowns them all.\r\n\r\nI can foresee no better fate for the disused graveyards than that they\r\nshould become gardens or playgrounds. The churchyards must be gardens,\r\nas green and bright and neat as they can be made, for the older people;\r\nand the unconsecrated grounds, detached from places of worship, will\r\nserve as playgrounds, many of them having to be reclaimed from their\r\npresent use as builders’ yards, cooperages, &c. Spa Fields, Clerkenwell,\r\na burial-ground to the history of which I have already referred, is a\r\ntypical London playground, in the very centre of the town, although\r\nsurrounded by courts and streets with such rural names as Rosoman\r\nStreet, Wood Street, Pear-tree Court and Vineyard Walk—grim reminders of\r\nwhat the district was like a hundred years or more ago. Exmouth Street,\r\nbehind which this open space is situated, is worth a visit. I was there\r\nrecently, one Monday afternoon. Trucks and stalls with wares of all\r\nkinds lined the narrow road, and there seemed scarcely a square yard\r\nwithout a person on it. One woman was selling old garments, of which she\r\nhad only about six, and these were spread out on the road itself—in the\r\nmud. A little farther on I noticed a stall, where two women were making\r\npurchases of “freshly-boiled horse-flesh at 2d. a lb.” This was not cut\r\nup as for cat’s meat, but was in large, dark brown, shapeless-looking\r\njoints. In the middle of the street is the Church of the Holy Redeemer,\r\na huge structure in imitation of an Italian church. It stands on the\r\nsite of the Spa Fields Chapel, an old round building, removed a few\r\nyears ago, belonging to the Lady Huntingdon Connexion, which had a stone\r\nobelisk in front of it to the memory of Lady Huntingdon, who lived in a\r\nneighbouring house. Behind the church is the open space, which is nearly\r\ntwo acres in extent. Originally taken for a tea-garden the speculation\r\nfailed, and the ground was used as a burial-ground, slightly lower fees\r\nbeing charged than in the neighbouring churchyards. After being grossly\r\novercrowded it was closed for interments in 1853. For several years the\r\nspace has been used as a drill-ground by the 3rd Middlesex Artillery and\r\nthe 39th Middlesex Rifles; and in 1885 the Metropolitan Public Gardens\r\nAssociation entered into negotiations with the owner, the Marquis of\r\nNorthampton, and he generously handed it over at a nominal rental for\r\nthe purposes of a children’s playground, and subsequently added to it\r\nhalf an acre of adjoining land. The association drained it and carted a\r\nlarge amount of soil and gravel into it, and put up some gymnastic\r\napparatus in the additional piece, which was not a part of the\r\nburial-ground. The entrance is from Vineyard Walk, Farringdon Road. When\r\nI last visited the playground, although it was a chilly afternoon, a\r\ngreat many children were enjoying themselves, and some women were\r\nswinging their little ones. But after or between school-hours is the\r\nproper time to see it. Then it is crowded, and every swing, rope, pole,\r\nbar, ladder, and skipping-rope is in use, and children are running about\r\nall over the open part of the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPA FIELDS PLAYGROUND.]\r\n\r\nIt is a strange-looking place. On the north-west side is the unfinished\r\napse of the Church of the Holy Redeemer, and on the south side is the\r\nparish mortuary, the presence of which does not seem to have any\r\nsobering effect upon the children. I watched four boys on the giant’s\r\nstride, and when they had vacated it a little girl of about eight years,\r\nwho had been sitting on a seat with a baby on her lap, and was knitting\r\na long strip with odd bits of coloured wools, beckoned to another\r\nsad-looking little girl sitting on my seat, and off they went to take\r\nthe boys’ places. The baby was deposited on yet another seat, and it\r\nwept copiously. But the children did not heed its cries; they had a\r\nsilent and vigorous turn at the giant’s stride, each holding on to two\r\nropes. They neither spoke nor smiled, and, when they had finished, the\r\none returned to her baby and her knitting and the other clambered on to\r\nthe back of the long-suffering and well-worn vaulting-horse. They are\r\nvery strong, some of these poor children, and it is wonderful what they\r\ncan do. The shabbiest often seem the most active. I noticed one little\r\nlad, whose clothes were literally dropping to pieces—shoes, stockings,\r\nknickerbockers, and blouse all in tatters—and he twisted himself about\r\non the handle swings, putting his toes through the handles, and\r\nperforming all sorts of gyrations which many a well-fed boy, clad in the\r\nbest of flannels, would have given his all to be able to accomplish.\r\n\r\nA playground such as Spa Fields is about as different from an ordinary\r\nvillage green, where country boys and girls romp and shout, as two\r\nthings with the same purpose can well be. For the soft, green grass, you\r\nhave gritty gravel; for the cackling geese who waddle into the pond, you\r\nhave a few stray cats walking on the walls; for the picturesque cottages\r\novergrown with roses and honeysuckle, you have the backs of little\r\nhouses, monotonous in structure, in colour, and in dirt; and instead of\r\nresting “underneath the shadow vast of patriarchal tree,” you must be\r\ncontent with a wooden bench close to the wall, bearing on its back the\r\nname of the association which laid out the ground. But it is only\r\nnecessary to have once seen the joy with which the children of our\r\ncrowded cities hail the formation of such a playground, and the use to\r\nwhich they put it, to be convinced that the trouble of acquiring it, or\r\nthe cost of laying it out, is amply repaid. They are so crowded at home,\r\nso crowded at school, so crowded in the roads, that it seems hard to\r\nlose one opportunity of securing a piece of ground, however small, where\r\nthey can be free to stretch their arms, their legs, and their lungs,\r\naway from the dangers and the sad sights of the streets, under the\r\ncharge of a kindly caretaker,\r\n\r\n                    “And where beadles and policemen\r\n                     Never frighten them away.”\r\n\r\nAnd can the dead beneath the soil object to the little feet above them?\r\nI am sure they cannot. Even Gray, in describing Stoke Pogis Churchyard,\r\nwhich is surrounded by meadows, rejoiced to see the “little footsteps\r\nlightly print the ground.” Such a space as Spa Fields may never have\r\nbeen consecrated for the use of the dead, but perchance the omission is\r\nin part redeemed by its dedication to the living.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              APPENDIX A.\r\n\r\n\r\nBURIAL-GROUNDS WITHIN THE METROPOLITAN AREA, WHICH STILL EXIST, WHOLLY\r\n    OR IN PART. ABRIDGED FROM THE RETURN PREPARED FOR THE LONDON COUNTY\r\n    COUNCIL IN THE SPRING OF 1895, AND CORRECTED UP TO DATE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               HAMPSTEAD.\r\n\r\n1. _St. John’s Churchyard._—1½ acres in extent. It is full of\r\ntombstones, but very neatly kept, and although not handed over to any\r\npublic authority, nor provided with seats, the gates are usually open.\r\n\r\n2. _Burial-ground in Holly Lane._—1¼ acres. This is still used for\r\ninterments, and new graves are occasionally dug here. It was consecrated\r\nin 1812. It is tidily kept, and the gates are open whenever the gardener\r\nis on the ground.\r\n\r\n3. _Hampstead Cemetery._—19½ acres. First used in 1876. Open daily. It\r\nis well kept, except the part nearest to Fortune Green.\r\n\r\n4. _The Tumulus, Parliament Hill Fields._—Excavated in 1894 by the\r\nLondon County Council, and said to be an ancient British burial-place of\r\nthe early bronze period. Railed round for its protection.\r\n\r\nN.B.—There are tumuli in Greenwich Park, and evidences of Roman\r\ncemeteries and other ancient burial-places in several parts of London.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ST. MARYLEBONE.\r\n\r\n5. _St. Marylebone Episcopal Chapel-ground_, High Street.—⅓ acre\r\n\r\nThis chapel was the parish church until 1816. The churchyard is full of\r\ntombstones, closed and fairly neat.\r\n\r\n6. _St. Marylebone Burial-ground_, Paddington Street, north side.—¾\r\nacre. A mortuary was built in it a few years ago. The ground was\r\nconsecrated in 1772. It is closed to the public, but neatly kept and\r\nused as a garden for the inmates of the adjoining workhouse.\r\n\r\n7. _St. Marylebone_ (also called _St. George’s_) _Burial-ground_,\r\nPaddington Street, south side.—2¼ acres. Consecrated in 1733, and very\r\nmuch used. Since 1886 it has been maintained as a public garden by the\r\nvestry, and is well kept.\r\n\r\n8. _St. John’s Wood Chapel-ground._—An additional burial-ground for the\r\nparish of Marylebone. 6 acres. The tombstones have not been moved, but\r\nthe Marylebone Vestry maintains the ground as a public garden. It has a\r\nfew seats in it, and is neatly kept.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PADDINGTON.\r\n\r\n9. _St. Mary’s Churchyard._—1 acre. The tombstones have not been moved,\r\nbut the ground has been neatly laid out, and is kept open by the vestry.\r\n\r\n10. _The Old Burial-ground_, Paddington.—3 acres. This adjoins St.\r\nMary’s Churchyard, and was laid out and opened as a public garden by the\r\nvestry in 1885. It contains the site of an older church, dedicated to\r\nSt. James.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              KENSINGTON.\r\n\r\n11. _St. Mary Abbots Churchyard._—About 1¼ acres. The graveyard is\r\nsmaller than it was 20 years ago because the present church is far\r\nlarger than the original one, and recently a long porch or cloister has\r\nbeen added. It is neatly laid out but closed to the public.\r\n\r\n12. _Holy Trinity Churchyard_, Brompton.—3½ acres. There are public\r\nthoroughfares through this ground, but they are railed off, and the\r\nchurchyard is closed and has a neglected appearance.\r\n\r\n13. _Brompton Cemetery_, also called West London Cemetery and London and\r\nWestminster Cemetery.—38 acres. First used in 1840. By 1889 upwards of\r\n155,000 bodies had been interred there. It is crowded with tombstones,\r\nand is in the midst of a thickly populated district.\r\n\r\n14. _All Souls Cemetery_, Kensal Green, partly in Hammersmith.—69 acres.\r\nOpen daily and neatly kept. This cemetery has been in use since 1833,\r\nand it is crowded with tombstones and contains catacombs and numerous\r\nvaults and mausoleums.\r\n\r\n15. _Burial-ground of the Franciscan Convent of St. Elizabeth_,\r\nPortobello Road.—This is a triangular grass plot, not above ¼ acre in\r\nsize, in the garden behind the convent. It is surrounded by trees and\r\nneatly kept. It was sanctioned by the Home Secretary in 1862, and is\r\nonly used for the interment of nuns, of whom five have been buried here,\r\nthe first in 1870 and the last in 1893.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              HAMMERSMITH.\r\n\r\n16. _St. Paul’s Churchyard._—1 acre. This is smaller than it used to be,\r\nthe present church being larger than the old one, and a piece of the\r\nground having been taken in 1884 to widen the road. It is neatly laid\r\nout and often open, but not a public recreation ground. It was\r\nconsecrated in 1631, and frequently enlarged.\r\n\r\n17. _St. Peter’s Churchyard_, Black Lion Lane.—1,800 square yards.\r\nClosed and untidy.\r\n\r\n18. _New West End Baptist Chapel-ground_, King Street.—¼ acre. This is\r\nnorth and south of the chapel, the northern part having been encroached\r\nupon. Closed and neatly kept.\r\n\r\n19. _Wesleyan Chapel Burial-ground_, Waterloo Street.—The chapel has\r\nbeen supplanted by a Board School, and the playground is the site of the\r\nburial-ground. It is tar-paved, has a few trees in it, and is about 500\r\nsquare yards in size.\r\n\r\n20. _Friends Burial-ground_, near the Creek.—300 square yards. This is\r\non the north side of the Friends meeting-house, and is closed, but very\r\nneat. There are a few flat tombstones, and burials took place until\r\nabout 1865.\r\n\r\n21. _St. Mary’s Roman Catholic Cemetery_, Kensal Green.—30 acres. The\r\nfirst interment was in 1858, and it is now crowded with vaults,\r\ntombstones, &c. It is open daily and neatly kept.\r\n\r\n22. _The Cemetery of the Benedictine Nunnery_, Fulham Palace Road.—This\r\nis a small burial-ground in the garden. According to a report from the\r\nHome Office it is about 14 by 12 yards in extent. It was in use before\r\n1829, but was closed for interment some years ago.\r\n\r\n23. _The Cemetery of the Convent_ (_Nazareth Home_), in Hammersmith\r\nRoad.—This is at the extreme end of the garden, under the wall of Great\r\nChurch Lane. It is not more than 12 yards by 9 yards, and is used for\r\nthe interment of the sisters, burials only taking place at considerable\r\nintervals. This ground has been in use for upwards of 40 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                FULHAM.\r\n\r\n24. _All Saints’ Churchyard._—Two acres or more. This is kept open\r\nduring the summer months, and has seats in it, but the gravestones have\r\nnot been moved, nor has the ground been handed over to any public\r\nauthority for maintenance. It is neatly kept. No new graves are dug in\r\nit, but where the rights can be proved certain old vaults are still\r\noccasionally used.\r\n\r\n25. _St. Mary’s Churchyard_, Hammersmith Road.—Size ½ acre. This ground\r\nis closed, but fairly tidy. Several of the tombstones have been moved.\r\n\r\n26. _St. John’s Churchyard_, Walham Green.—½ acre. There are only a few\r\ntombstones on the north side of the church and none on the south side,\r\nand the ground is closed and appears neglected.\r\n\r\n27. _St. Thomas’s Roman Catholic Churchyard_, Fulham.—2,600 square\r\nyards. This ground was closed by order in Council in 1857, but only\r\npartially, for new graves are still dug in it, in the midst of a\r\ndensely-populated district of new streets. The gate is usually open.\r\n\r\n28. _Lillie Road pest-field_ (the orchard of Normand House).—The site of\r\nthis orchard, then 4 acres in extent, was used extensively for burials\r\nat the time of the Great Plague. Lintaine Grove now occupies part of it,\r\nand a row of houses in Lillie Road. Only about ¾ acre is still unbuilt\r\nupon, at the corner of Tilton Street, and this is offered for sale.\r\n\r\n29. _Fulham Cemetery._—12½ acres. First used in 1865. Open daily.\r\n\r\n30. _Hammersmith Cemetery_, in Fulham Fields.—16½ acres. First used in\r\n1869. Open daily.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHELSEA.\r\n\r\n31. _St. Luke’s Churchyard_ (the old church on the Embankment).—¼ acre.\r\nThis ground is closed and neglected.\r\n\r\n32. _St. Luke’s Churchyard_ (the new church in Robert Street).—2¼ acres.\r\nThis ground was consecrated in 1812, and contains vaults and catacombs.\r\nIt was laid out as a public garden and is maintained by the Chelsea\r\nVestry.\r\n\r\n33. _Old Burial-ground_, King’s Road.—¾ acre. Given to the parish of\r\nChelsea by Sir Hans Sloane, consecrated in 1736, and enlarged in 1790. A\r\nmortuary has been built in it. It is laid out as a garden for the use of\r\nthe inmates of the adjoining workhouse. Fragments of an old chapel and\r\ngraveyard have been found here.\r\n\r\n34. _Chelsea Hospital Graveyard_, Queen’s Road.—1⅓ acres. This ground\r\nwas used for the interment of the pensioners. It is closed, but neatly\r\nkept.\r\n\r\n35. _All Souls Roman Catholic Burial-ground_, Cadogan Terrace.—1½ acres.\r\nThe adjoining chapel (St. Mary’s) was consecrated in 1811. The ground is\r\nclosed and full of tombstones.\r\n\r\n36. _Moravian Burial-ground_, Milman’s Row.—The part actually used for\r\ninterments is fenced in and closed. It is neatly kept, the tombstones\r\nbeing very small flat ones. It belongs to the Congregation of the\r\nMoravian Church in Fetter Lane, E.C., and was closed by order in Council\r\nabout 8 years ago.\r\n\r\n37. _Jewish Burial-ground_, Fulham Road.—½ acre. It belongs to the\r\nWestern Synagogue, St. Alban’s Place, S.W., and was first used in 1813.\r\nIt is closed to the public except between 11 and 4 on Sundays.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     ST. GEORGE’S, HANOVER SQUARE.\r\n\r\n38. _St. George’s Burial-ground_, Mount Street.—1¼ acres. Laid out as a\r\npublic garden, and beautifully kept by the vestry. The ground dates from\r\nabout 1730, but there are very few tombstones.\r\n\r\n39. _St. George’s Burial-Ground_, Bayswater Road.—Laid out by the\r\nvestry, the gravestones having been placed round the walls. The\r\napproaches to this ground are its chief drawback, and it is not visible\r\nfrom any public road. One entrance is through the chapel facing Hyde\r\nPark, and the other is in a mews. It is about 5 acres in extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                WESTMINSTER (ST. MARGARET AND ST. JOHN).\r\n\r\n40. _The Churchyard of Westminster Abbey._—What remains of the extensive\r\nburial-ground which once occupied this site is the piece of land on the\r\nnorth side of the Abbey, and the cloisters. (See _St. Margaret’s_.)\r\n\r\n41. _St. Margaret’s Churchyard._—This was laid out as a public garden,\r\nand forms one ground with the Abbey churchyard. It is well kept up by\r\nthe burial board of the parish. The size of the churchyard, with the\r\nground used for interments which belongs to the Abbey, is about 2¼\r\nacres.\r\n\r\n42. _Christ Church Churchyard_, Victoria Street (also called St.\r\nMargaret’s burying-ground).—This church was a chapel of ease to St.\r\nMargaret’s. The adjoining graveyard has had a vicarage built in it. What\r\nremains is 7,000 square yards in size, closed, with flat tombstones and\r\ngrass.\r\n\r\n43. _St. John the Evangelist Churchyard_, Smith Square.—This churchyard\r\nused to extend, at the beginning of the century, for some distance on\r\nthe south side of the church, but was thrown into the road. Now all that\r\nremains is a very small bare enclosure, not ¼ acre in size, railed in\r\nround the church.\r\n\r\n44. _Additional ground for St. John’s Parish_, Horseferry Road.—Walled\r\nin in 1627, and very much used, especially for the burial of soldiers.\r\nIt is 1½ acres in size, and has been laid out as public garden. It is\r\nneatly kept by the vestry, and much frequented.\r\n\r\n45. _Vincent Square._—8 acres. This is what remains of the Tothill\r\nFields pest-field. It is the playground of Westminster School, and some\r\nbuildings have been erected in it. A stone-paved yard in Earl Street is\r\nsaid to be the site of the plague-pits.\r\n\r\n46. _Millbank Penitentiary Burial-ground._—432 square yards in size. In\r\n1830-33 there were an average of 14 interments per annum, but at times\r\nit was more used. The site of this graveyard will be preserved when the\r\nspace which used to be occupied by the prison is built upon.\r\n\r\n47. _Knightsbridge Green._—Victims of the plague from the leper hospital\r\nand elsewhere were buried here. A grassy, closed triangle opposite\r\nTattersalls.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      ST. MARTIN’S IN THE FIELDS.\r\n\r\n48. _St. Martin’s Churchyard._—⅓ acre. This is stone-paved, has trees\r\nand seats in it supplied by the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association,\r\nand is maintained by the vestry.\r\n\r\n49. _Additional ground in Drury Lane._—Less than ¼ acre. Laid out as a\r\npublic garden, and now maintained by the vestry. It is well kept, and\r\ncontains some gymnastic apparatus for the use of the children. Also\r\ncalled the Tavistock burial-ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       ST. JAMES’S, WESTMINSTER.\r\n\r\n50. _St. James’s Churchyard_, Piccadilly.—½ acre. This is a dreary\r\nground, and might be made very attractive. The part where most burials\r\ntook place is considerably raised above the rest. The yard on the north\r\nside of the church is entirely paved with stones, amongst which are many\r\ntombstones. In the upper part tombstones form the walks, the walls, &c.\r\nOne gate is often unlatched.\r\n\r\n51. _St. James’s Workhouse Ground_, Poland Street.—The workhouse was\r\nbuilt upon a “common cemetery” where, at the time of the plague, many\r\nthousands of bodies were interred. A small part of it was kept as the\r\nworkhouse burial-ground, but this has now disappeared, and all that is\r\nleft of the original ground used for interments is the garden or\r\ncourtyard of the workhouse. It is a pleasant recreation ground for the\r\ninmates, and is well supplied with seats, being about ¼ acre in extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE STRAND.\r\n\r\n52. _St. Mary le Strand Churchyard._—At the west end of the church,\r\nabout 200 square yards in size, closed and not well kept.\r\n\r\n53. _Additional ground, Russell Court, Catherine Street._—430 square\r\nyards. It is probable that few grounds in London were more overcrowded\r\nwith bodies than this one, which was entirely surrounded by the backs of\r\nsmall houses. When closed in 1853 it was in a very disgusting and\r\nunwholesome condition, and it continued to be most wretched until the\r\nMetropolitan Public Gardens Association asphalted it in 1886. It is\r\nmaintained as a children’s playground by the London County Council. This\r\nis the scene of “Tom all alone’s” in “Bleak House.” There are 6\r\ngravestones against the wall.\r\n\r\n54. _St. Clement Danes Churchyard._—This is now ¼ acre in extent, having\r\nbeen curtailed when the Strand was altered. It is closed.\r\n\r\n55. _Additional ground, Portugal Street._—This was called the\r\n“Green-ground,” and was crowded with bodies. A corner of King’s College\r\nHospital was built upon the ground. The remaining piece is nearly ½ acre\r\nin size, between the hospital and Portugal Street. It is now the\r\nentrance drive and a grass plot. It is neatly kept, with some trees and\r\nseats in it, and is used solely by the hospital.\r\n\r\n56. _St. Paul’s Churchyard_, Covent Garden.—¾ acre. Given by the Earl of\r\nBedford in 1631. It is closed and very neat, the tombstones forming a\r\nflat paved yard round the church, while the rest of the ground is\r\nturfed.\r\n\r\n57. _St. Ann’s Churchyard_, Soho.—½ acre. It is estimated that in this\r\nsmall ground and the vaults under the church 110,240 bodies were\r\ninterred during 160 years. It was laid out by the Metropolitan Public\r\nGardens Association in 1892, and is maintained as a recreation ground in\r\nvery good order by the Strand District Board of Works.\r\n\r\n58. _The Churchyard of the Chapel Royal_ (_St. Mary’s_), Savoy.—¼ acre.\r\nThis ground was much used for the internment of soldiers. It belongs to\r\nHer Majesty the Queen, as Duchess of Lancaster, and was laid out as a\r\npublic garden at the cost of the Queen, the Earl of Meath, and others.\r\nIt is well maintained by the parish.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ST. GILES IN THE FIELDS.\r\n\r\n59. _St. Giles’ Churchyard._—Nearly an acre. This ground being\r\noriginally consecrated by a Roman Catholic, was much used by the poor\r\nIrish. It was enlarged in 1628, and at various subsequent dates, and was\r\nvery much overcrowded, and it occupies the site of an ancient graveyard\r\nattached to a leper hospital. It has been laid out as a public garden,\r\nand is maintained by the St. Giles’ District Board of Works. The\r\nbrightest part of the ground is north of the church, and this is only\r\nopened at the discretion of the caretaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HOLBORN.\r\n\r\n60. _Additional ground for St. John’s, Clerkenwell_, in Benjamin\r\nStreet.—This land, which is nearly ¼ acre in extent, was consecrated in\r\n1775. It was laid out as a public garden ten years ago, and is\r\nmaintained by trustees with help from the Holborn District Board of\r\nWorks and the Clerkenwell Vestry. Very well kept.\r\n\r\n61. _Charterhouse Square._—This garden is a part of the site of a\r\nburial-ground dating back to 1349, when Sir Walter de Manny purchased\r\nfrom St. Bartholomew’s Hospital 13 acres of land, known as the Spittle\r\nCroft, for the burial of those who died in the plague of that time. In\r\n20 years 50,000 bodies were interred there. In 1371 the Carthusian\r\nMonastery was built upon it. This Pardon Churchyard was a space of three\r\nacres acquired a year earlier, to which the plague-ground was added.\r\nThis Pardon Churchyard survived longer, being used for suicides and\r\nexecuted people. Charterhouse Square is 1¼ acres.\r\n\r\n62. _The old Charterhouse Graveyard._—In 1828 to 1830, when the present\r\nPensioners’ Court and other buildings were erected, part of this ground\r\nwas built upon; but part exists in the courtyard on each side of the\r\nPensioners’ Courts, being about ⅓ acre in extent. All the open land has\r\nbeen used at one time or another for burials.\r\n\r\n63. _The new Charterhouse Burial-ground._—When the above ground was done\r\naway with, a smaller piece to the north was set aside for the interment\r\nof the pensioners. This remains still, and is very neatly kept. There\r\nare a few gravestones on the wall and splendid fruit trees. It is about\r\n¼ acre in extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CLERKENWELL.\r\n\r\n64. _St. James’s Churchyard._—¾ acre. This ground was purchased in 1673,\r\nenlarged in 1677, and is now laid out as a public garden and maintained\r\nby the vestry.\r\n\r\n65. _Additional ground, Bowling Green Lane_ (called St. James’s middle\r\nground).—This was leased by the parish, with the adjoining “Cherry Tree”\r\npublic-house, in 1775 for 99 years. It is ¼ acre in size, situated at\r\nthe corner of Rosoman Street and Bowling Green Lane. The London School\r\nBoard secured it when the lease ran out, and it is now the playground of\r\nthe Bowling Green Lane School.\r\n\r\n66. _The Burial-ground of St. James’s_, Pentonville Road.––This was\r\nformed as an additional ground for the parish of St. James, Clerkenwell.\r\nIt is nearly an acre in extent, full of tombstones and very untidy, but\r\nthe Metropolitan Public Gardens Association has undertaken to convert it\r\ninto a public garden.\r\n\r\n67. _St. John’s Churchyard._—What exists of this is between the church\r\nand St. John Street, a narrow strip, about 320 square yards in extent,\r\nclosed and paved with tiles and tombstones. Its laying out by the\r\nMetropolitan Public Gardens Association is in hand.\r\n\r\n68. _Spa Fields Burial-ground_, Exmouth Street.—Originally a tea-garden,\r\nafterwards a burial-ground, managed by a private individual. It is the\r\nproperty of the Marquis of Northampton, is about 1¾ acres in extent, and\r\nin the evenings is occasionally used as a volunteer drill-ground. In\r\n1885 the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association laid it out as a\r\nplayground, and the London County Council maintains it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ST. PANCRAS.\r\n\r\n69. _St. Pancras Burial-ground_, Pancras Road.\r\n\r\n70. _St. Giles in The Fields Burial-ground_, Pancras Road.—These two\r\ngrounds now form one garden, about 6 acres in extent, maintained with\r\nmuch care for the use of the public by St. Pancras Vestry. St. Giles’\r\nground dates from 1803, but the other is much older. In 1889 part of St.\r\nPancras ground was acquired under a special Act by the Midland Railway\r\nCompany. This part was, in 1791, assigned to the French _Émigrés_, and\r\nmany celebrated Frenchmen and Roman Catholics were buried there. Part of\r\nit has not actually been built upon, as the railway goes over it on\r\narches. There are many high stacks of tombstones in the garden, and a\r\n“trophy” and a “dome” of headstones, numbering 496, which were taken\r\nfrom the part acquired by the railway.\r\n\r\n71. _St. Martin’s in the Fields Burial-ground_ in Pratt Street.—1¾\r\nacres. This was consecrated in 1805. It is now a well-kept public garden\r\nunder the control of the St. Pancras Vestry. A part appears to have been\r\nappropriated as a private garden for the almshouses and as a site for a\r\nchapel and other buildings.\r\n\r\n72. _St. James’s Burial-ground_, Hampstead Road.—This belongs to the\r\nparish of St. James, Piccadilly. It was laid out as a public garden in\r\n1887, and is maintained by the St. Pancras Vestry, a large slice at the\r\neast end having been taken off for public improvements. The remaining\r\nportion measures about 3 acres.\r\n\r\n73. _St. Andrew’s Burial-ground_, Gray’s Inn Road.—1¼ acres. This ground\r\nbelongs to the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn, adjoins the church of Holy\r\nTrinity, and is maintained as a public garden by the St. Pancras Vestry.\r\nIt is well kept, except a railed-off piece south of the church, which is\r\na sort of lumber-room.\r\n\r\n74. _The Burial-ground of St. George’s_, Bloomsbury.\r\n\r\n75. _The Burial-ground of St. George the Martyr_, Bloomsbury.—These are\r\nout of Wakefield Street, Gray’s Inn Road, and together form one public\r\ngarden maintained by the St. Pancras Vestry, and very well kept. A part\r\nof the latter, which was consecrated in 1714, is still closed. Each\r\nground is 1¼ acres in extent. There are vaults under the church in Hart\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\n76. _Whitfield’s Tabernacle Burial-ground_, Tottenham Court\r\nRoad.—Somewhat less than ½ acre. The London County Council opened it as\r\na public garden in February, 1895. It is said that in 97 years upwards\r\nof 30,000 bodies were interred in this ground.\r\n\r\n77. _Wesleyan Chapel-ground_, Liverpool Street, King’s Cross.—An untidy\r\nlittle closed yard at the west end of the chapel containing two\r\ntombstones and much rubbish, and measuring about 225 square yards.\r\n\r\n78. _St. James’s Cemetery_, Highgate.—38 acres. First used in 1839. In\r\n50 years 76,000 interments had taken place. It is in two portions and\r\nsituated on a steep slope. Open daily.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ISLINGTON.\r\n\r\n79. _St. Mary’s Churchyard._—1⅓ acres. This ground was enlarged in 1793,\r\nand was laid out as a public garden in 1885. It is maintained by the\r\nvicar and churchwardens.\r\n\r\n80. _Additional ground round the Chapel of Ease in Holloway Road._—4\r\nacres. This is also laid out as a public garden, and is beautifully kept\r\nby the Islington Vestry.\r\n\r\n81. _Burial-ground of St. John’s Roman Catholic Church_, Duncan Row.—½\r\nacre. A strip at the northern end of this ground is railed off with some\r\ntombstones in it, the remainder being tar-paved and used as a playground\r\nfor the boys’ Roman Catholic school.\r\n\r\n82. _Islington Chapel-ground_, Church Street (also called Little Bunhill\r\nFields).—The original chapel was built in 1788, and had a small\r\ngraveyard. In 1817 the Rev. Evan Jones bought the garden of 5, Church\r\nRow, and added it to this graveyard, the whole ground being nearly 1\r\nacre in extent. It is now in several divisions, part is a yard belonging\r\nto the General Post Office, and the other parts are let and sold as\r\nbuilders’ yards, or are vacant.\r\n\r\n83. _Maberley Chapel-ground_, Ball’s Pond Road.—Now called Earlham Hall.\r\nThe ground is about 270 square yards, between the chapel and the road.\r\nIt is closed and bare.\r\n\r\n84. _Jewish Burial-ground_, Ball’s Pond.—1¼ acres. This belongs to the\r\nWest London Synagogue, is very neatly kept, and is still in use. It is\r\nfull of very large tombstones.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ST. LUKE’S.\r\n\r\n85. _St. Luke’s Churchyard_, Old Street.—In two parts. Size of the whole\r\nground, nearly 1¾ acres. The piece round the church is closed, and full\r\nof large altar tombs, ivy being planted most profusely. There is a great\r\ndeal of rubbish in it. The part on the north side was laid out as a\r\npublic garden in 1878, and is maintained by the vestry.\r\n\r\n86. _The Poor ground_, Bath Street.—¼ acre. This was originally larger\r\nthan it is now. It was consecrated in 1662 for the parish of St. Giles,\r\nCripplegate, and called the pest-house ground. After 1732, when St.\r\nLuke’s parish was formed, it was used by that parish. Now it is neatly\r\nlaid out and used as a recreation ground by the patients of the St.\r\nLuke’s Asylum. It is ¼ acre in extent.\r\n\r\n87. _Wesleyan Chapel-ground_, City Road.—½ acre. The part in front of\r\nthe chapel is neatly kept, but the part behind is closed and not so\r\ntidy. Wesley himself was buried in a vault here.\r\n\r\n88. _Bunhill Fields._—5 or 6 acres. This was originally two grounds, the\r\nsouthern part having been intended for burials in the Great Plague, but\r\nnot being used was let by the Corporation to a Mr. John Tyndall, who\r\ncarried it on as a private cemetery. Subsequently the northern part was\r\nadded, and the whole ground extensively used for the interment of\r\nDissenters. The Corporation maintain it as a public garden, but the\r\ntombstones have not been moved, and only the gates at the eastern end\r\nare generally open.\r\n\r\n89. _The Friends Burial-ground_, Bunhill Row.—Acquired in 1661, many\r\ntimes added to, and chiefly used by the Friends of the Peel and\r\nBull-and-Mouth divisions. In 1840 a school was built in it. The existing\r\nportion is about ½ acre in size, and is neatly kept as a private garden;\r\nbut the remainder was used as the site for a Board School, a coffee\r\npalace, houses and shops, including the Bunhill Fields Memorial\r\nBuildings, erected in 1881.\r\n\r\n90. _St. Bartholomew’s Hospital Ground_, Seward Street.—⅓ acre. This was\r\nused for the interment of the unclaimed bodies. After being closed it\r\nwas let as a carter’s yard until it was laid out as a public playground\r\nby the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association in 1891. It is maintained\r\nby St. Luke’s Vestry.\r\n\r\n91. _Cripplegate Poor ground_, Whitecross Street.—It was called the\r\n“upper churchyard” of St. Giles, and was first used in 1636. It was very\r\nmuch overcrowded, the fees being low. A part of the site is occupied by\r\nthe church and mission-house of St. Mary, Charterhouse, erected in 1864,\r\nand only a very small courtyard now exists between these buildings, with\r\na large vault.\r\n\r\n92. _The City Bunhill (or Golden Lane) Burial-ground._—¼ acres. This was\r\nthe site of a brewery, and set aside for burials in 1833. About\r\none-third of it is in the City. It is now divided. One part is in the\r\noccupation of Messrs. Sutton and Co., carriers, and is full of sheds and\r\ncarts, the greater part being roofed in, and the southern part has the\r\nCity mortuary and coroner’s court on it. What is unbuilt upon is a neat,\r\nprivate yard between these two buildings. It was closed for burials in\r\n1853.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SHOREDITCH.\r\n\r\n93. _St. Leonard’s Churchyard._—1½ acres. Maintained as a public garden\r\nby the Shoreditch Vestry. It is, I believe, partly in Bethnal Green.\r\n\r\n94. _Old Burial-ground_, Hackney Road.—½ acre. This has an ancient\r\nwatch-house in it, which was subsequently used as a cholera hospital. In\r\n1892 the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association laid it out as a public\r\nplayground, and it is maintained by the Burial Board.\r\n\r\n95. _Holywell Mount Burial-ground._—Behind St. James’s Church, Curtain\r\nRoad, which occupies the site of a theatre of Shakespeare’s time. The\r\nground is very old, and was much used at the time of plagues, and many\r\nactors are buried there. There is only about ⅓ acre left, the greater\r\npart having been used as the site for a parish room, and this is a\r\ntimber-yard approached from Holywell Row.\r\n\r\n96. _St. Mary’s Churchyard_, Haggerston.—1⅓ acre. This is maintained by\r\nthe Shoreditch Burial Board as a public garden, open during the summer.\r\nIt was laid out by the Earl and Countess of Meath in 1882.\r\n\r\n97. _St. John’s Churchyard_, Hoxton.—1¼ acres. Also maintained by the\r\nShoreditch Burial Board, and laid out by the Earl and Countess of Meath.\r\n\r\n98. _Jewish Burial-ground_, Hoxton Street.—¼ acre. This belongs to the\r\nUnited Synagogue, and was used from 1700 till 1795. There is no grass,\r\nbut many tombstones, and some one is sent four times a year to clear\r\naway the weeds, &c. It is not a tidy ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HACKNEY.\r\n\r\n99. _St. John at Hackney Churchyard._—6 acres. This includes an older\r\nground, attached to the original church of St. Augustine, of which the\r\ntower still remains. Part of the churchyard is laid out as a public\r\ngarden, and is neatly kept by the Hackney District Board of Works, but\r\nthe newer part to the south of the church is still full of tombstones\r\nand rather untidy grass. The newest part of all, “the poor ground,”\r\nwhich is at the extreme southern end, is laid out for the use of\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n100. _West Hackney Churchyard_, Stoke Newington Road.—Nearly 1½ acres.\r\nThis was consecrated in 1824, and laid out as a public garden in 1885.\r\nIt is maintained by the Hackney District Board of Works.\r\n\r\n101. _St. Barnabas’s Churchyard_, Homerton.—¾ acre. This ground is not\r\nopen, but a good deal of care is shown in its management. In 1884 the\r\nEaster offerings were devoted to its improvement, and many tombstones\r\nwere then laid flat.\r\n\r\n102. _St. John of Jerusalem Churchyard_, South Hackney.—About ¾ acre.\r\nThis was consecrated in 1831. It is full of tombstones, and the grass is\r\nnot well kept, but it is usually open for people to pass through. It was\r\nclosed for burials in 1868.\r\n\r\n103. _Wells Street Burial-ground._—This contains the site of the\r\noriginal South Hackney Church. It was laid out as a public garden in\r\n1885, and is very neatly kept by the Hackney District Board of Works.\r\nNearly ¾ acre.\r\n\r\n104. _Independent Chapel-ground_, Mare Street (also called St. Thomas’\r\nSquare Burial-ground).—⅔ acre. Laid out in 1888, and maintained by the\r\nHackney District Board of Works, who paid, £100 for a passage to join\r\nthis ground with No. 103, one caretaker managing both of them. It is\r\nvery bright and neat. The ornamental shelter occupies the site of a\r\nprevious building.\r\n\r\n105. _Baptist Chapel-ground_, Mare Street.—About 500 square yards at the\r\nback of the chapel. There are several tombstones tumbling about, and the\r\nground is very untidy.\r\n\r\n106. _New Gravel Pit Chapel-ground_, Chatham Place, attached to the\r\nUnitarian Church.—¾ acre. This is full of tombstones and fairly tidy.\r\nThe gate is usually open, the chapel-keeper living behind the chapel,\r\nand having a green-house and fowl-house, &c., in the ground.\r\n\r\n107. _Retreat Place._—A garden in front of 12 almshouses, founded in\r\n1812 “for the widows of Dissenting ministers professing Calvinistic\r\ndoctrines.” Samuel Robinson, the founder, and his wife, are buried in\r\nthe middle of the garden.\r\n\r\n108. _Jewish Burial-ground_, Grove-street.—2¼ acres. This belongs to the\r\nUnited Synagogue, and was purchased in 1788. It is closed and full of\r\nerect tombstones, and has some trees and flower-beds near the entrance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            STOKE NEWINGTON.\r\n\r\n109. _St. Mary’s Churchyard_, Stoke Newington.—¾ acre. A very pretty\r\nground round the old church, but not laid out or opened.\r\n\r\n110. _Friend’s Burial-ground_, Park Street, Stoke Newington, adjoining\r\nthe meeting-house.—¾ acre. This was bought in 1827, and enlarged in\r\n1849. It is still in use and neatly kept, but not open to the public.\r\n\r\n111. _Abney Park Cemetery._—32 acres. First used in 1840. Neatly kept\r\nand open daily, being chiefly used by Dissenters. It is crowded with\r\ntombstones.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             BETHNAL GREEN.\r\n\r\n112. _St. Matthew’s Churchyard._—About 2 acres. This was consecrated in\r\n1746, and was much overcrowded. A mortuary was built in it some years\r\nago. There are vaults under the schools as well as the church. It is\r\nclosed, but negotiations are on foot respecting its conversion into a\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\n113. _St. Peter’s Churchyard_, Hackney Road.—¼ acre. This churchyard is\r\nmaintained as a public garden by the vicar, who opens it during the\r\nsummer months. There are not many tombstones.\r\n\r\n114. _St. Bartholomew’s Churchyard_, near Cambridge Road.—Nearly an\r\nacre. This was laid out by the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association\r\nin 1885, and is maintained by the London County Council. It is immensely\r\nappreciated.\r\n\r\n115. _St. James the Less Churchyard_, Old Ford Road.—Over an acre.\r\nClosed and considerably below the church. It contains about 10\r\ntombstones, and several cocks and hens live in it. It is bare and damp.\r\n\r\n116. _Providence Chapel Burial-ground_, Shoreditch Tabernacle, Hackney\r\nRoad, was built on the site of the chapel. Part of the graveyard exists\r\nas a tar-paved yard or passage by the Tabernacle, with 4 tombstones\r\nagainst the walls.\r\n\r\n117. _Victoria Park Cemetery._—11 acres. This is maintained as a public\r\ngarden by the London County Council, having been laid out in 1894 by the\r\nMetropolitan Public Gardens Association. It was formed in 1845, and used\r\nfor 40 years. Before being laid out it was a most dreary,\r\nneglected-looking place; the soil is a heavy clay, and there used to be\r\nlarge wet lumps lying about all over the ground. At a burial in 1884 the\r\nclerk brought a handful of earth out of his pocket to throw upon the\r\ncoffin. Now it is a bright, useful, little park, and is called Meath\r\nGardens.\r\n\r\n118. _Peel Grove Burial-ground_ (also called North-East London Cemetery,\r\nCambridge Heath or Road Burial-ground and Keldy’s Ground). According to\r\na return in 1855 it was 4 acres in extent, but now there is hardly one\r\nacre. It is in the occupation of J. Glover and Sons, dealers in building\r\nmaterials, and is full of wood, pipes, &c. There are some sheds in it.\r\nIt was a private ground, formed 100 years ago, and was very much\r\ncrowded. The late Metropolitan Board of Works saved the existing part\r\nfrom being built over. Before its present use it was often let out for\r\nshows, fairs, &c.\r\n\r\n119. _Gibraltar Walk Burial-ground_, Bethnal Green Road.—Another private\r\nground, formed about 100 years ago. It belongs to a lady who lives in\r\nthe house which opens into it, and who has let pieces of it as yards for\r\nthe shops and houses round. It is full of shrubs, trees, and weeds, and\r\ncovered with rubbish, and is about ¾ acre in size.\r\n\r\n120. _Jewish Burial-ground_, Brady Street.—This existed 100 years ago,\r\nand belongs to the United Synagogue. I believe it is about 4 acres. It\r\nis crowded with upright gravestones, and there are no properly made\r\npaths, but it is covered with neglected grass. Part of it is higher than\r\nthe rest, the soil having been raised and the ground having been used a\r\nsecond time. This was the “Strangers’” portion.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              WHITECHAPEL.\r\n\r\n121. _St. Mary’s Churchyard._—¾ acre. This is a very old churchyard, and\r\nwas much overcrowded. It is maintained by the rector as a garden, but a\r\ncharge of 1d. is made for entrance. It is neatly laid out.\r\n\r\n122. _Additional ground, Whitechapel Road_, entrance in St. Mary’s\r\nStreet.—This was called the workhouse burial-ground, the workhouse\r\nhaving been built in 1768 upon a former graveyard, and this piece to the\r\nnorth of it having then been set aside for interments and consecrated in\r\n1796. The workhouse site was built upon some years ago, and the\r\nburial-ground became the playground of the Davenant Schools, one of\r\nwhich, the one facing St. Mary’s Street, was built in it. In the order\r\nfor closing it, dated May 9, 1853, it is called the Whitechapel\r\nWorkhouse and Schools Ground. It is difficult to say exactly how far\r\neast the burial-ground extended, but from the Ordnance map and some\r\nolder plans it would appear that the recent addition to the school in\r\nWhitechapel Road has been built in the burial-ground. In 1833 the size\r\nwas given as 2,776 square yards, but it was stated that in 1832 196\r\ncholera cases were interred in an adjoining piece of ground. This is\r\nprobably what is now used as a stoneyard, with carts in it.\r\n\r\n123. _Christ Church Churchyard_, Spitalfields.—1¾ acres. Laid out as a\r\npublic garden by the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association in 1892,\r\nthe association having undertaken to maintain it for 5 years.\r\n\r\n124. _St. Peter and Vincula Churchyard_, in the Tower.—This, with the\r\nvaults under the church, was used for the interment of distinguished\r\nprisoners. It is a part of the great courtyard, and is about 525 square\r\nyards in extent.\r\n\r\n125. _Holy Trinity Churchyard_, Minories.—A burial-ground possibly\r\ndating back to 1348. It has been added to the roadway of Church Street,\r\nsome posts showing its boundaries. It was about 302 square yards in\r\nextent. Part has been built upon.\r\n\r\n126. _Aldgate Burial-ground_, Cartwright Street.—This belongs to the\r\nparish of St. Botolph, Aldgate, and was consecrated in 1615. At the\r\nbeginning of this century it was covered with small houses, the Weigh\r\nHouse School being built on it in 1846. The rookery was cleared by the\r\nMetropolitan Board of Works, and Darby Street was made, gravestones and\r\nremains being then discovered. The Metropolitan Public Gardens\r\nAssociation informed the Board of the former existence of a\r\nburial-ground, with the result that what remained of the burial-ground\r\nwas not built upon, but was made into an asphalted playground, about ⅛\r\nacre in extent, for the children of the adjoining block of tenements.\r\n\r\n127. _German Lutheran Church_, Little Alie Street.—A small yard exists\r\nat the back of the church. Closed.\r\n\r\n128. _Friends Burial-ground_, Baker’s Row.—Very nearly an acre. This\r\nbelonged to the Friends of the Devonshire House division, who acquired\r\nit in 1687. It is leased by the society to the Whitechapel District\r\nBoard of Works, who maintain it as a public recreation ground. It is\r\nwell laid out and well kept, being chiefly used by children.\r\n\r\n129. _Mile End New Town Burial-ground_, Hanbury Street.—This adjoined\r\nthe chapel, and extended from Hanbury Street to Old Montague Street. A\r\nschool and other buildings have been erected in it, and all that is left\r\nis a paved yard, about 250 square yards in size, on the west side of the\r\nchapel.\r\n\r\n130. _Sheen’s Burial-ground_, Church Lane.—A private ground, immensely\r\nused. It seems to have been at one time used by the congregation of the\r\nBaptists in Little Alie Street, and was then called “Mr. Brittain’s\r\nburial-ground.” If so it existed in 1763. After being closed for burials\r\nit was used as a cooperage, and now it is Messrs. Fairclough’s yard, and\r\nfull of carts and sheds, &c. A new stable was built in 1894, but the\r\nLondon County Council declined to prevent its erection. The size of the\r\nground is about ½ acre.\r\n\r\n131. _The Landon Hospital Burial-ground._—In a plan of 1849 the whole of\r\nthe southern part of the enclosure is marked as a burial-ground, which\r\nwould be 1½ acres in extent. It was closed on November 25, 1853, but at\r\nthe hospital it is stated that bodies were interred there after 1859,\r\nthough not after 1864. Since then the medical school, the chaplain’s\r\nhouse, and the nurses’ home have been built in it. The remaining part of\r\nthe ground is used as a garden and tennis-lawn for the students and\r\nnurses.\r\n\r\n                       ST. GEORGE’S IN THE EAST.\r\n\r\n132. _St. George’s Churchyard._—Dates from about 1730. The wall between\r\nthis ground and the next one was taken down in 1875, and the two grounds\r\nwere laid out as a public garden. They are maintained by the vestry,\r\nand, although in a densely crowded district, are beautifully kept. The\r\nsize of the whole garden, consisting of the two graveyards, is about 3\r\nacres.\r\n\r\n133. _St. George’s Wesleyan Chapel-ground_, Cable Street.—This forms one\r\ngarden with the above.\r\n\r\n134. _New Road Congregational Chapel-yard_, Cannon Street Road, between\r\nLower and Upper Chapman Streets.—This was a much-used burial-ground,\r\npart of which has been covered with sheds and houses. What is left is\r\nabout ⅓ acre in extent. The chapel was bought in 1832, and became\r\nTrinity Episcopal Chapel, and was subsequently removed and its site used\r\nfor the new building of Raine’s School. The burial-ground is in three\r\nparts, viz., the playground of the school, a cooper’s yard, belonging to\r\nMessrs. Hasted and Sons, and a carter’s yard of Messrs. Seaward\r\nBrothers.\r\n\r\n135. _Danish Burial-ground_, Wellclose Square.—The Danish (or Mariners’)\r\nChurch has been supplanted by the Schools of St. Paul’s, London Docks,\r\nand the whole of the garden is neatly laid out, and used as a private\r\nground for the people who look after the schools, the crèche, &c. There\r\nare no tombstones now, and it is possible that only an enclosure round\r\nthe church was used, like the railed-in enclosure in Prince’s Square.\r\n\r\n136. _Swedish Burial-ground_, Prince’s Square.—Round the Eleanora\r\nChurch, over ½ acre in size. It is very neatly laid out and well kept,\r\nand contains many tombstones.\r\n\r\n137. _Ebenezer Chapel Burial-ground_, St. George’s Street.—This was\r\ndescribed in 1839 as being very much overcrowded. The chapel has been\r\nused us a school, but is now deserted, the small yard on the south side\r\nof it is used as a timber-yard and closed. About 220 square yards.\r\n\r\n138. _Congregational Chapel-ground_, Old Gravel Lane.—140 square yards.\r\nClosed, bare, and untidy, with two gravestones against the wall.\r\n\r\n139. _Baptist Burial-ground_, Broad Street, Wapping.—Mentioned by\r\nMaitland in 1756, and shown on Rocque’s plan. The chapel has gone, but\r\npart of the adjoining yard exists as a small yard belonging to a\r\nmilkman. Before he bought it it was the parish stoneyard. It is about\r\n200 square yards in size. I have little doubt that this is a\r\nburial-ground.\r\n\r\n140. _Roman Catholic Burial-ground_, Commercial Road.—The tombstones are\r\nflat and the ground is used as a private garden for the priests. It is\r\nabout ½ acre in extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LIMEHOUSE.\r\n\r\n141. _St. Anne’s Churchyard._—3 acres. Consecrated 1730, and since\r\nenlarged, but in 1800 a piece was cut of for Commercial Road, the bodies\r\nbeing removed south of the church. Laid out as a public garden by the\r\nMetropolitan Public Gardens Association in 1887, and now maintained by\r\nthe London County Council. It is nearly kept, except the private passage\r\nto the mortuary.\r\n\r\n142. _St. Paul’s Churchyard_, Shadwell.—¾ acre. Consecrated in 1671, but\r\nused before that as a pest-field for Stepney. Laid out by the\r\nMetropolitan Public Gardens Association in 1886, and now maintained and\r\nkept in good order by the London County Council.\r\n\r\n143. _St. James’s Churchyard_, Ratcliff.—Nearly 1 acre. Laid out as a\r\npublic garden by the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association in 1891,\r\nand maintained by the vicar.\r\n\r\n144. _St. John’s Churchyard_, Wapping.—600 square yards. Consecrated in\r\n1617. This ground used to be very low and full of water. It is closed\r\nand fairly tidy, having many large altar tombs in it.\r\n\r\n145. _Additional ground opposite St. John’s Church._—Rather over ½ acre.\r\nThis was one of the Stepney pest-fields. It is closed, but tidy. There\r\nare quantities of tombstones in this ground, many of which seem to be\r\nfalling to pieces, and an unusual number of trees and flowering shrubs.\r\n\r\n146. _Friends Burial-ground_, Brook Street. Ratcliff.—800 square yards.\r\nThis is approached through the house on the south side of the\r\nmeeting-house. It was acquired by the Society of Friends in 1666 or\r\n1667, the land being originally copyhold, but enfranchised in 1734 for\r\n£21. It is neatly kept, and has four small upright stones.\r\n\r\n147. _Brunswick Wesleyan Chapel-ground_, Three Colt Lane.—Approached by\r\na passage at the back of the chapel. It is about 450 square yards in\r\nsize, and is used as a private garden. There are vaults under the chapel\r\nand three tombstones. It is said that about 1,000 bodies were buried\r\nhere, the last interment taking place in 1849.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           MILE END OLD TOWN.\r\n\r\n148. _St. Dunstan’s Churchyard Stepney._—About 6 acres, or rather more.\r\nAt the time of the Great Plague about 150 bodies were interred here\r\ndaily, and several extra grounds were provided for the parish. It was\r\nlaid out as a public garden in 1887 by the Metropolitan Public Gardens\r\nAssociation. It is a most useful and shady ground, and is very neatly\r\nkept by the London County Council.\r\n\r\n149. _Stepney Meeting-House Burial-ground_, White Horse Street (also\r\ncalled the Almshouse ground and Ratcliff Workhouse ground).—There are\r\nmany tombstones and the ground is fairly tidy. The gate is generally\r\nopen, as the entrance to the almshouses is through it. Size ½ acre.\r\n\r\n150. _Holy Trinity Churchyard_, Tredegar Square.—¾ acre. Laid out by the\r\nMetropolitan Public Gardens Association in 1887, and maintained by the\r\nLondon County Council. The gravestones have not been moved, and some of\r\nthe graves are still occasionally used, though no new ones are dug.\r\n\r\n151. _Wycliffe Chapel Burial-ground_, Philport Street, Stepney.—¾ acre.\r\nThis dates From 1831, and is behind the chapel and the Scotch church. It\r\nis full of tombstones, closed and untidy. Chadwick divides it into a\r\npart belonging to the chapel and a larger part belonging to the Scotch\r\nchurch, but it appears to be all one now, and is in the hands of the\r\nelders of Wycliffe Chapel.\r\n\r\n152. _Globe Road Chapel Burial-ground_, also called Mile End\r\nCemetery.—The chapel is now Gordon Hall, and belongs to Dr. Stephenson\r\nof the Children’s Homes. The burial-ground is in private hands. The\r\nground was very much overcrowded, and there were vaults under the\r\nchapel, the schools and the sexton’s house, but all the part south of\r\nthe chapel was taken by the Great Eastern Railway Company. The existing\r\npiece is about 670 square yards in extent, is closed and most untidy,\r\nquantities of rubbish lying about amongst the tombstones.\r\n\r\n153. _East London Cemetery_, Shandy Street, also called the Beaumont\r\nBurial-ground.—2¼ acres. This was much crowded. It was laid out as a\r\nplayground by the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association in 1885, and\r\nis maintained by the London County Council.\r\n\r\n154. _Burial-ground of the Bancroft Almshouses_, Mile End Road.—The\r\nPeople’s Palace is on the site of the almshouses, and part of the\r\nburial-ground has been merged into the roadway on the east side of the\r\npalace. St. Benet’s Church, Hall and Vicarage were built in this ground,\r\nthe church being consecrated in 1872. Three pieces still exist, in all\r\nless than ½ acre; one is the vicarage garden, another is open to the\r\nroad, and the northern point is closed and roofed over, forming a little\r\nyard where flag-staff’s, &c., are stored. The open part is also a\r\nstore-yard, having heaps of stones in it, besides much rubbish. There\r\nare gravestones against the wall.\r\n\r\n155. _Stepney Pest-field._—Many acres to the south of the London\r\nHospital were used for interments at the time of the plague, and the\r\nBrewers’ Garden and the space by St. Philip’s Church are, according to\r\nsome authorities, part of the site originally called Stepney Mount. At\r\nthe Home Office it is believed that there have been no burials in the\r\nground round St. Philip’s, nor have there since it was St. Philip’s\r\nchurchyard; but I think there were long before the first St. Philip’s\r\nChurch or the Brewers’ Almshouses existed. The Brewers’ Garden is open\r\nto the public at a charge of 1d.\r\n\r\n156. _Jewish Burial-ground_, 70, Bancroft Road.—About 1,650 square\r\nyards. This ground belongs to the Maiden Lane Synagogue, and is crowded\r\nwith upright gravestones. The grass is neglected. Burials still take\r\nplace. It is in a densely-populated district.\r\n\r\n157. _Jewish Burial-ground_, Alderney Road.—1 acre. Formed in 1700,\r\nenlarged in 1733. Belongs to the United Synagogue. The tombstones are\r\nupright, and they are not so thick as in most of the Jewish grounds,\r\nwhile the grass is kept more neatly.\r\n\r\n158. _Jewish Burial-ground_, Mile End Road.—This ground is nearly ¾ acre\r\nin extent, and is at the back of the Beth Holim Hospital. It belongs to\r\nthe Spanish and Portuguese Jews, the tombstones are flat, there are\r\nseveral trees, and the ground is very neatly kept. Part of the graveyard\r\n(where it is said that there have been no interments) has some seats in\r\nit, and is used by the patients of the hospital as a garden.\r\n\r\n159. _Jewish Cemetery_, Mile End Road.—4¾ acres. This belongs to the\r\nSpanish and Portuguese Jews, and is still in use. The gravestones are\r\nflat ones and low altar tombs, and the ground is neatly kept, although\r\nvery bare.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                POPLAR.\r\n\r\n160. _All Saints’ Churchyard._—Size, with that part which was used for\r\nthe burial of cholera victims, on the other side of the road, 4 acres.\r\nThe northern part of the churchyard was laid out by the Metropolitan\r\nPublic Gardens Association in 1893, the rector having undertaken to\r\nmaintain it for a few years. It is much appreciated and well kept.\r\n\r\n161. _St. Matthias’s Churchyard._—(This church was the chapel of the\r\nEast India Dock Company, and is sometimes called Poplar Chapel.) 1¼\r\nacres. It is in the middle of the Poplar Recreation Ground, closed and\r\nfairly tidy. There are many tombstones.\r\n\r\n162. _St. Mary’s Churchyard_, Bow.—2,716 square yards. This is in two\r\nportions, the eastern one is closed, but the western one has been laid\r\nout by the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association and provided with\r\nseats, the rector maintaining it.\r\n\r\n163. _St. Mary’s Churchyard_, Bromley-by-Bow, or Bromley St.\r\nLeonard.—This churchyard is 1¼ acres in size and is closed, but very\r\nneatly kept up by the parish, and has some tombstones of artistic value\r\nin it. Its opening as a public garden is under consideration.\r\n\r\n164. _Baptist Chapel-ground_, Bow.—⅓ acre. Part of this ground is railed\r\noff as a private garden, the rest is used as a thoroughfare by the\r\nschool-children. There are several tombstones, some of which have been\r\nput against the walls.\r\n\r\n165. _Trinity Congregational Chapel-ground_, East India Dock Road.—⅓\r\nacre. This was laid out in 1888 as a public garden, the minister of the\r\nchapel maintaining it. On his removal from the district it was closed\r\nand has not been re-opened.\r\n\r\n166. _Roman Catholic ground_, Wade’s Place.—1,300 square yards. This\r\nbelonged to St. Mary’s Roman Catholic Church in Finsbury Circus,\r\nMoorfields, and was chiefly used for the poor Irish. It was a very damp,\r\nunwholesome ground. It is now used as a playground for the adjoining\r\nRoman Catholic school.\r\n\r\n167. _City of London and Tower Hamlets Cemetery_ (partly in Mile\r\nEnd).—33 acres. First used in 1841. By 1889, 247,000 bodies had been\r\ninterred here, many being buried in common graves. It is still in use\r\nand open daily, a regular ocean of tombstones, many of which are lying\r\nabout, apparently uncared for and unclaimed; in fact, most of the\r\ngraves, except those at the edges of the walks, look utterly neglected,\r\nand parts of the ground are very untidy. It is situated in a\r\ndensely-populated district.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              WANDSWORTH.\r\n\r\n168. _All Saints’ Churchyard_, High Street.—¼ acre. This is closed, and\r\nis much more tidy at the eastern end than the western end.\r\n\r\n169. _East Hill Burial-ground_, Wandsworth Road.—½ acre. This was\r\nconsecrated in 1680, and many French Huguenots were buried in it. It is\r\nclosed and fairly tidy.\r\n\r\n170. _Garratt Lane Cemetery_, South Street, Wandsworth.—1¾ acres. This\r\nwas consecrated in 1808. It is closed to the public, and closed for\r\ninterments with the exception of widows, widowers, and parents of\r\ndeceased persons already interred there. It is maintained by the\r\nWandsworth Burial Board.\r\n\r\n171. _Friends Burial-ground_, High Street, Wandsworth.—400 square yards.\r\nThis is attached to the meeting-house, is closed and very neatly kept.\r\nThere are a few upright tombstones.\r\n\r\n172. _Baptist Burial-ground_, North Street, Wandsworth.—An untidy little\r\nclosed yard with no tombstones in it and neglected grass. The chapel now\r\nbelongs to the Salvation Army. I doubt if it was much used for burials,\r\nbut, at any rate, there was one interment in 1854. It is about the same\r\nsize as the Friends’ ground.\r\n\r\n173. _Independent Burial-ground_, Wandsworth.—This is now a small\r\ntar-paved yard adjoining Memorial Hall, which was built on the site of\r\nan old chapel or school-house. There are a few trees.\r\n\r\n174. _St. Mary’s Churchyard_, Putney.—½ acre. Closed and neatly kept.\r\n\r\n175. _Putney Burial-ground_, Upper Richmond Road.—1 acre. This was a\r\ngift to the parish from the Rev. R. Pettiwand, and consecrated in 1763.\r\nIt was laid out in 1886, but the tombstones were not moved, and many of\r\nthem are dilapidated brick altar tombs. It is maintained for the public\r\nby the Putney Burial Board.\r\n\r\n176. _St. Nicholas Churchyard_, Lower Tooting.—2 acres. This is still in\r\nuse. It is open daily and kept in good order.\r\n\r\n177. _Lower Tooting Chapel-ground._—231 square yards behind the chapel\r\n(Congregational in High Street) and about 30 square yards in front. Some\r\ntombstones. Chapel dates from 1688, and was founded by Daniel Defoe.\r\n\r\n178. _St. Leonard’s Churchyard_, Streatham.—1¼ acres. The present church\r\ndates from 1831, but the churchyard is at least 100 years older. It is\r\nclosed for burials and well planted with flowers, grass, and trees. The\r\ngates are sometimes open.\r\n\r\n179. _St. Paul’s Churchyard_, Clapham, in the Wandsworth Road.—1½ acres.\r\nThis is closed, and very full of tombstones. It is maintained by the\r\nClapham Burial Board, but it is in a rather jungly condition.\r\n\r\n180. _Union Chapel-ground_, Streatham Hill.—About 500 square yards. This\r\nis a neat little garden between the chapel and the schools, both of\r\nwhich have been rebuilt, the schools in 1878. There is a row of\r\ntombstones against the walls. It is generally closed.\r\n\r\n181. _Wandsworth Cemetery._—12 acres. First used in 1878. Open daily.\r\n\r\n182. _Lambeth Cemetery_, Tooting Graveney.—41 acres. First used in 1854.\r\nOpen daily.\r\n\r\n183. _Putney Cemetery._—3 acres. First used in 1855. This is an\r\nencroachment on a common.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BATTERSEA.\r\n\r\n184. _St. Mary’s Churchyard._—¾ acre. Closed. The laying out of this\r\nground is under consideration.\r\n\r\n185. _St. George’s Churchyard_, Battersea Park Road.—¾ acre. This is\r\nclosed, and in a very neglected condition. There are not many\r\ngravestones.\r\n\r\n186. _Battersea Cemetery_, Bolingbroke Grove.—8½ acres. First used in\r\n1860. Open daily.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                LAMBETH.\r\n\r\n187. _St. Mary’s Churchyard._—½ acre. A very old ground, enlarged in\r\n1623 and 1820. It is very neatly laid out and the gates are left open,\r\nthough there are no seats in it.\r\n\r\n188. _Additional ground in High Street_ (also called Paradise Row\r\nburial-ground).—1½ acres. Given to the parish by Archbishop Tenison, and\r\nconsecrated in 1705. It was laid out in 1884 by the Lambeth Vestry, who\r\nmaintain it efficiently.\r\n\r\n189. _St. John’s Churchyard_, Waterloo Bridge Road.—An acre in size.\r\nThis was laid out as a garden and playground in 1877, and is well kept\r\nup by the Lambeth Vestry.\r\n\r\n190. _St. Mark’s Churchyard_, Kennington.—1¾ acres. This is closed and\r\nfull of tombstones, but neatly kept.\r\n\r\n191. _Regent Street Baptist Chapel-ground_, Kennington Road.—A little\r\nground at the back of the chapel, with a few tombstones and one great\r\nvault in it.\r\n\r\n192. _Esher Street Congregational Chapel-ground_, Upper Kennington\r\nLane.—About 480 square yards, closed, and very untidy.\r\n\r\n193. _St. Matthew’s Churchyard_, Brixton.—2 acres. This dates from 1824.\r\nIt is closed, but neatly kept.\r\n\r\n194. _Denmark Row Chapel-ground_, Coldharbour Lane.—This has been partly\r\nbuilt upon, and there is now only a small yard behind the chapel.\r\n\r\n195. _Stockwell Green Congregational Chapel-ground._—¼ acre, or rather\r\nmore. This is behind the chapel, and is a particularly neglected and\r\nuntidy graveyard.\r\n\r\n196. _St. Luke’s Churchyard_, Norwood.—1 acre. This dates from 1825. It\r\nis tidily kept, except the part near the station. The gate is generally\r\nopen. The gravestones are in situ.\r\n\r\n197. _Congregational Chapel-ground_, Chapel Road, Lower Norwood.—About ⅓\r\nacre behind the chapel. It is closed, and has grass and a few tombstones\r\nin it.\r\n\r\n198. _Norwood Cemetery_, 40 acres.—First used in 1838. Open daily, and\r\nfairly well kept. It is crowded with tombstones, and it includes a Greek\r\ncemetery and a burial-ground belonging to the parish of St. Mary at\r\nHill, each about 550 square yards in size.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CAMBERWELL.\r\n\r\n199. _St. Giles’s Churchyard._—3¼ acres. Enlarged in 1717, 1803, and\r\n1825. Closed, full of tombstones, and not well kept.\r\n\r\n200. _St. George’s Churchyard_, Well Street, Camberwell.—The church was\r\nconsecrated in 1824, the ground being given by Mr. John Rolls. The\r\nchurchyard measures about an acre, and was laid out in 1886 by the\r\nMetropolitan Public Gardens Association. It is maintained by the vestry.\r\nA mortuary has been built on it.\r\n\r\n201. _Dulwich Burial-ground_, Court Lane, the graveyard of God’s Gift\r\nCollege.—Size, 1½ roods. This ground dates from about 1700. It is closed\r\nand very neatly kept. There are several large altar tombs in it, and it\r\nis a most rural and picturesque spot.\r\n\r\n202. _Wesleyan Chapel-ground._ Stafford Street, Peckham.—336 square\r\nyards. The chapel in now a school, the burial-ground being the\r\nplayground, a paved yard.\r\n\r\n203. _Friends Burial-ground_, Peckham Rye.—About 470 square yards. This\r\nground was purchased in 1821, it is behind the meeting-house in Hanover\r\nStreet, has some small flat gravestones in it, and is closed. It is most\r\nbeautifully kept with neatly mown grass and a border of flowers.\r\n\r\n204. _Camberwell Cemetery_, Forest Hill Road.—29½ acres. First used in\r\n1856. Open daily.\r\n\r\n205. _Nunhead Cemetery_ (All Saints’).—50 acres. First used in 1840.\r\nOpen daily.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               NEWINGTON.\r\n\r\n206. _St. Mary’s Churchyard._—1¼ acres. This was enlarged in 1757 and\r\n1834, and is now maintained as a public garden by the burial board, the\r\nfreehold being vested in the rector. It is well laid out.\r\n\r\n207. _St. Peter’s Churchyard_, Walworth.—1¼ acres. This is also\r\nmaintained as a public garden by the Newington Burial Board, having been\r\nlaid out by the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association, at the sole\r\ncost of the Goldsmiths’ Company, and opened in May, 1895.\r\n\r\n208. _Sutherland Congregational Chapel-ground_, Walworth.—This is close\r\nto St. Peter’s, about 300 square yards in size, and closed. It has been\r\nsomewhat encroached on by the school, which was enlarged in 1889. A few\r\ntombstones exist in the passage on the north side of the chapel and in\r\nthe ground at the back. It is fairly tidy.\r\n\r\n209. _York Street Chapel-ground_, Walworth.—About 700 square yards at\r\nthe rear of the chapel and not visible from the street. It is closed and\r\nfull of tombstones, but is to be laid out.\r\n\r\n210. _East Street Baptist Chapel-ground_, Walworth.—About 400 square\r\nyards, with one tombstone in it. It is closed and very untidy.\r\n\r\n211. _St. John’s Episcopal Chapel-ground_, Walworth.—In 1843 it was\r\nestimated at 6,400 square yards. The chapel is in Penrose Street, and is\r\nnow the workshop of a scenic artist, the front wall having been\r\nheightened for the purpose of advertising the _South London Press_. The\r\nburial-ground is approached from Occupation Road, Manor Place, the\r\nrailway line going across it on arches, and it is now the vestry depôt\r\nfor carts, manure, gravel, &c. An adjoining plot is the site for the\r\nbaths and washhouses. This ground is in danger of being encroached upon,\r\nand new bays for dust and other erections of the sort are often built in\r\nit.\r\n\r\n212. _New Bunhill Fields_, Deverell Street, New Kent Road (also called\r\nHoole and Martin’s).—¾ acre. This was a private speculation, and was\r\nmost indecently crowded. Between 1820 and 1838 10,000 bodies were buried\r\nhere, the vault under the chapel containing 1,800 coffins. The ground\r\nwas closed in 1853, and it then became a timber-yard. The chapel now\r\nbelongs to the Salvation Army, but the burial-ground is still\r\n“Deverell’s timber-yard,” and is covered with high stacks of timber.\r\nThere are many sheds in it, and iron bars, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ST. GEORGE THE MARTYR.\r\n\r\n213. _St. George’s Churchyard_, Borough.—This is about an acre in size,\r\nand is maintained as a public garden by the rector and churchwardens,\r\nhaving been laid out in 1882. It is much used.\r\n\r\n214. _St. George’s Recreation ground_, Tabard Street (the Lock\r\nburial-ground).—Rather over ¼ acre. This was originally the\r\nburial-ground of the Lock Hospital, which was pulled down in 1809, a\r\nportion of the site of the hospital and ground having been before then\r\nconsecrated as a parish burial-ground. It was chiefly used for pauper\r\nburials, and was crowded with bodies. It is now a neat public garden,\r\nlaid out by the vestry in 1887, and in the possession of the rector and\r\nchurchwardens of St. George’s.\r\n\r\n215. _Chapel Graveyard_, Collier’s Rents, Long Lane.—This is about 620\r\nsquare yards in extent, and is on the north side of an old Baptist\r\nchapel, which now belongs to the Congregational Union. The ground dates\r\nfrom before 1719, and is closed. There are a few tombstones and grass,\r\nbut it is not very well kept.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ST. SAVIOR’S, SOUTHWARK.\r\n\r\n216. _St. Saviour’s Churchyard._—This ancient ground has been often\r\nenlarged and curtailed, and at times was used as a marketplace. What now\r\nexists is about ½ acre on the south side of the church, which is at\r\npresent under restoration.\r\n\r\n217. _Additional ground for St. Saviour’s_, called the College Yard or\r\nSt. Saviour’s Almshouse Burial-ground, Park Street.—This existed before\r\n1732. Size, ¼ acre. The London, Brighton and South Coast Railway goes\r\nover it on arches, and it is now the store-yard of Messrs. Stone and\r\nHumphries, builders. Most of it is roofed in, but it is not actually\r\ncovered with buildings.\r\n\r\n218. _Additional ground for St. Saviour’s_, called the Cross Bones,\r\nRedcross Street.—This was made, at least 250 years ago, “far from the\r\nparish church,” for the interment of the low women who frequented the\r\nneighbourhood. It was subsequently used as the pauper ground, and was\r\ncrowded to excess. Nevertheless two schools were built in it. The\r\nremaining piece is about 1,000 square yards. It has frequently been\r\noffered for sale as a building site, and has formed the subject for much\r\nlitigation. It is made a partial use of by being let for fairs, swings,\r\n&c. It was sold as a building site in 1883, but, not having been used by\r\n1884, the sale was declared (under the Disused Burial-grounds Act) null\r\nand void.\r\n\r\n219. _Christ Church Churchyard_, Blackfriars Bridge Road.—1½ acres. This\r\ndates from about 1737, and has been enlarged. An infant school was built\r\nin it. It is closed, and not laid out.\r\n\r\n220. _Deadman’s Place Burial-ground._ Deadman’s Place is now called Park\r\nStreet.—This ground was originally used for the interment of large\r\nnumbers of victims to the plague. Then it became the graveyard of an\r\nadjoining Independent chapel, and was extensively used for the interment\r\nof ministers, being a sort of Bunhill Fields for South London. Now it is\r\nmerely one of the yards over which trucks run on rails, in the middle of\r\nthe large brewery belonging to Messrs. Barclay and Perkins, about ½ acre\r\nin extent. It existed as a burial-ground in 1839, but not, I believe, in\r\n1843.\r\n\r\n221. _Baptist Burial-ground_, Bandy Leg Walk (subsequently called\r\nGuildford Street).—There was such a ground in 1729. In 1807 there\r\nexisted the St. Saviour’s Workhouse, with a burial-ground on the east\r\nside of it which, from its position, may have coincided with the\r\nBaptists’ ground, and what is now left of the burial-ground is a garden\r\nor courtyard, about 1,000 square yards in size, between the new\r\nbuildings of the Central Fire Brigade Station, Southwark Bridge Road,\r\nand the old house behind them. It is entered through the large archway.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ST. OLAVE’S.\r\n\r\n222. _St. Olave’s Churchyard_, Tooley Street.—A stone-paved yard, 634\r\nsquare yards in extent, between the church and the river. Closed.\r\n\r\n223. _Additional ground to St. Olave’s and to St. John’s_, Horselydown,\r\nnear St. John’s Church.—About ½ acre, with a few tombstones in it. This\r\nwas laid out in 1888, being chiefly asphalted, and is maintained as a\r\nrecreation ground by the Board of Works For the St. Olave’s District. It\r\nis well used and neatly kept.\r\n\r\n224. _St. John’s Churchyard_, Horselydown.—Nearly 2 acres. Laid out as a\r\npublic garden in 1882, and maintained by the St. Olave’s Board.\r\n\r\n225. _St. Thomas’s Churchyard._—This does not adjoin the church, but is\r\nbehind the houses opposite. Size about 787 square yards. It belongs to\r\nSt. Thomas’s Hospital, and is used as a private garden by a house in St.\r\nThomas’ Street.\r\n\r\n226. _St. Thomas’s Hospital Burial-ground_, St. Thomas’ Street.—Part of\r\nthis has been covered by St. Olave’s Rectory and Messrs. Bevington’s\r\nleather warehouse. The remaining piece measures about 1,770 square\r\nyards, and is an asphalted tennis-court and garden for the students of\r\nGuy’s Hospital, the building in it being the treasurer’s stables. It\r\nbelongs to St. Thomas’s Hospital, and is leased to Guy’s.\r\n\r\n227. _Butler’s Burial-ground_, Horselydown.—This was made about 1822,\r\nthe entrance being in Coxon’s (late Butler’s) Place, and was 1,440\r\nsquare yards in size. It is now Zurhoorst’s cooperage and is full of\r\nbarrels. A small piece, which I believe was a part of the burial-ground,\r\nis a yard belonging to a builder named Field. There were vaults running\r\nunder four dwelling-houses. These still exist, and are under the houses\r\nnext to the entrance to Mr. Field’s yard.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              BERMONDSEY.\r\n\r\n228. _St. Mary Magdalene’s Churchyard._—Rather over 1½ acres. This was\r\nenlarged in 1783 and 1810, and contains the remains of an ancient\r\ncemetery belonging to Bermondsey Abbey. It is maintained as a public\r\ngarden by the vestry, the rector reserving certain rights. It is well\r\nlaid out, and forms a most useful and attractive garden.\r\n\r\n229. _St. James’s Churchyard_, Bermondsey, Jamaica Road.—1¾ acres. It\r\nwas extensively used for a drying-ground for clean clothes when the\r\nMetropolitan Public Gardens Association secured it in 1886, and laid it\r\nout as a garden. It is maintained by the vestry.\r\n\r\n230. _Roman Catholic Ground_, Parker’s Row.—The land was given for the\r\npurpose in 1833 or 1834. The ground between the church and the road\r\nmeasures about 300 square yards, and was very much overcrowded. It is\r\nclosed and untidy, with no tombstones. Burials also took place in the\r\ngarden, which is used as a recreation ground for the schools, and is\r\nneatly kept.\r\n\r\n231. _Southwark Chapel Graveyard_ (_Wesleyan_), Long Lane.—900 square\r\nyards. This is on the west side of the chapel, which dates from 1808. It\r\nis closed, and contains a few gravestones and a hen-coop.\r\n\r\n232. _Guy’s Hospital Burial-ground_, Nelson Street.—This is nearly 200\r\nyears old, and is rather over ½ acre. Since being closed for burials it\r\nhas been let as a builder’s yard. The Bermondsey Vestry is now\r\nnegotiating for its purchase as a recreation ground.\r\n\r\n233. _Friends Burial-ground_, Long Lane.—¼ acre. This was bought in 1697\r\nfor £120. It was closed in 1844, but in 1860 a large number of coffins,\r\n&c., were brought there and interred when Southwark Street was made and\r\nthe Worcester Street burial-ground annihilated. It is being laid out for\r\nthe public, and will be maintained by the Bermondsey Vestry, who have it\r\non lease from the Society of Friends. There are no gravestones in it.\r\n\r\n234. _Ebenezer Burial-ground_, Long Lane.—This adjoins the above ground,\r\nand it is hoped that it may eventually be added to the garden. It was\r\nformed about 100 years ago. It originally belonged to the Independent\r\nChapel in Beck Street, Horselydown, and subsequently to the trustees of\r\nEbenezer Baptist Chapel. There is a “minister’s vault” in the centre. It\r\nis closed and untidy, 220 square yards in extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ROTHERHITHE.\r\n\r\n235. _St. Mary’s Churchyard._—¾ acre. This is closed, except on Sundays.\r\nIt is full of tombstones and kept in good order.\r\n\r\n236. _Additional ground in Church Street._—1¼ acres. This is also only\r\nopen on Sundays, and is fairly tidy.\r\n\r\n237. _Christ Church Churchyard_, Union Road.—700 square yards. This is\r\nclosed, and there are no tombstones on the north side of the church. The\r\nsouth side is rather untidy, except round the grave of General Sir\r\nWilliam Gomm, who gave the ground for the church (being Lord of the\r\nManor), where there is a patch of good grass and flowers.\r\n\r\n238. _All Saints’ Churchyard_, Deptford Lower Road.—Nearly 1 acre. This\r\nland was given by Sir William Gomm in 1840, and was used for 17 years.\r\nIt is closed, and wooden palings separate it from the ground in front of\r\nthe church. It is not well kept.\r\n\r\n239. _Holy Trinity Churchyard_, near Commercial Docks Pier.—About 1\r\nacre. Consecrated in 1838. This ground was also only used for 20 years;\r\na part of it is railed of for the vicarage garden, where probably no\r\ninterments took place. It was laid out by the Metropolitan Public\r\nGardens Association in 1885, and taken over by the London County Council\r\nin 1896. It is a very attractive, shady garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               GREENWICH.\r\n\r\n240. _St. Alphege Churchyard._—Enlarged in 1716, 1774, and 1808. Size\r\n2,740 square yards. This was laid out by the Metropolitan Public Gardens\r\nAssociation in 1889, and is maintained by the Greenwich District Board\r\nof Works. There are no seats in it.\r\n\r\n241. _Additional ground_, separated from the above by a public\r\nfootpath.—This is 2½ acres, and was consecrated in 1833. It was laid out\r\nin 1889 by the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association, and is\r\nmaintained by the Greenwich District Board of Works. There are plenty of\r\nseats in it, and it is well used and neatly kept.\r\n\r\n242. _St. Nicholas Churchyard_, Deptford.—¾ acre. This is closed and\r\nfull of tombstones, but fairly tidy.\r\n\r\n243. _Additional ground_, Wellington Street.—¾ acre. This ground,\r\nbelonging to the parish of St. Nicholas, was laid out in 1884 by the\r\nKyrle Society, and is very well kept up by the Greenwich District Board\r\nof Works, who have lately acquired a piece of adjoining land to be added\r\nto the recreation ground.\r\n\r\n244. _St. Paul’s Churchyard_, Deptford.—2½ acres. This is vested in the\r\nrector, and maintained by the Deptford Burial Board. The gravestones are\r\nnot moved, but there are a few seats in the ground, which is open to the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n245. _Baptist (Unitarian) Chapel Burial-ground_, Church Street.—This\r\ntouches the above, and is about ¼ acre. It is closed, the railings and\r\ngravestones are broken, and there is a quantity of rubbish lying about.\r\n\r\n246. _Friends Burial-ground_, High Street, Deptford.—About 360 square\r\nyards. This is behind the meeting-house and closed. It is neatly kept\r\nand only contains one gravestone.\r\n\r\n247. _Congregational Chapel Burial-ground_, High Street, Deptford.—About\r\n400 square yards. This is closed, but neatly laid out, and there are\r\ngravestones against the walls.\r\n\r\n248. _Congregational Chapel-ground_, Greenwich Road.—¼ acre, or rather\r\nless. This dates from 1800. The gate is often open, and the gravestones\r\nare flat or against the walls, but it is a bare, uninteresting-looking\r\nground.\r\n\r\n249. _Congregational Chapel-ground_, Maze Hill, Greenwich.—A rather\r\nneglected-looking ground in Park Place, with several flat tombstones,\r\nabout 500 square yards in size.\r\n\r\n250. _Greenwich Hospital Burial-ground._—This adjoins the Royal Naval\r\nSchools, and measures about 4 acres. An inner enclosure is full of\r\ntombstones, but the outer part has only some monuments in it. It is very\r\nwell kept, with splendid trees and good grass, and the gate from the\r\nschool playground is generally open.\r\n\r\n251. _Greenwich Hospital Cemetery._––In Westcombe. This is nearly 6\r\nacres in size, and was first used in 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LEWISHAM.\r\n\r\n252. _St. Mary’s Churchyard._—2 acres. Laid out as a public garden in\r\n1886, and maintained by the Lewisham District Board of Works.\r\n\r\n253. _St. Bartholomew’s Churchyard_, Sydenham.—¾ acre. Closed for\r\ninterments. This is beautifully kept and is a very pretty ground. The\r\ngates are generally open, but there are no seats.\r\n\r\n254. _Deptford Cemetery._—17 acres. First used in 1858. By 1889, 50,000\r\nbodies had been interred there.\r\n\r\n255. _Lewisham Cemetery._––15½ acres, of which 4 are reserved and let as\r\na market-garden. First used 1858.\r\n\r\n256. _Lee Cemetery._—In Hither Green. 10 acres, of which 4 are in\r\nreserve. First used 1873. These are open daily.\r\n\r\n                               PLUMSTEAD.\r\n\r\n257. _St. Nicholas’s Churchyard._—Still in use for burials, but under\r\nregulation. It is open daily, and measures about 4 acres.\r\n\r\n258. _Woolwich Cemetery_, Wickham Lane. (Partly outside the boundary of\r\nPlumstead.)—32 acres. First used in 1856. Open daily.\r\n\r\n259. _Plumstead Cemetery_, Wickham Lane.—32¼ acres. First used 1890.\r\nOpen daily.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  LEE.\r\n\r\n260. _St. John the Baptist Churchyard_, Lee, Eltham.—3 acres. This is\r\nalso in use, but under regulation, and is open daily.\r\n\r\n261. _St. Margaret’s Churchyard_, Lee.—Still in use, open daily, and\r\nvery neatly kept. It is about 1½ acres in size.\r\n\r\n262. _The Old Churchyard_, Lee.—This is opposite St. Margaret’s, and\r\ncontains the ruins of the old church. It is full of tombstones and\r\nneatly kept. It is generally open, but has no seats in it.\r\n\r\n263. _St. Luke’s Churchyard_, Charlton.—½ acre. This is full of\r\ntombstones and closed, but very neatly kept. Burials occasionally take\r\nplace in existing vaults, but in each case permission has to be obtained\r\nfrom the Home Secretary.\r\n\r\n264. _St. Thomas’s Churchyard_, Charlton.—On the borders of Woolwich.\r\nNearly an acre. This churchyard was in use for burials in 1854 when it\r\nwas put under regulation.\r\n\r\n265. _Morden College Cemetery_, Blackheath.—¼ acre. Closed. Neatly kept.\r\nContains about 80 tombstones. The college was founded about 1695.\r\n\r\n266. _Charlton Cemetery._—8 acres. First used in 1855. Open daily.\r\n\r\n267. _Greenwich Cemetery._—15 acres. Open daily.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               WOOLWICH.\r\n\r\n268. _St. Mary’s Churchyard._—Over 3 acres. In a fine situation\r\noverlooking the river. Laid out as a public garden by the Metropolitan\r\nPublic Gardens Association, at the cost of Mr. Passmore Edwards, and\r\nopened in May, 1895. It is maintained by the Woolwich Local Board.\r\n\r\n269. _Enon Chapel-yard_, High Street.—112 square yards. A tar-paved and\r\nclosed yard, with some tombstones against the walls.\r\n\r\n270. _Union Chapel Graveyard_, Sun Street.—⅓ acre. This is closed. There\r\nis a very bad fence round it, and it looks uncared for. Negotiations are\r\non foot to secure it for the public.\r\n\r\n271. _Salem Chapel-yard_, Powis Street.—300 square yards. Eighteen or\r\ntwenty years ago the London School Board took the chapel and adapted it\r\nas a school. It is now the infant school, other buildings having been\r\nadded, and the graveyard is a tar-paved passage used as a playground.\r\n\r\n272. _Wesleyan Chapel-yard_, William Street.—¼ acre. Here a school\r\nbuilding has evidently encroached upon the burial-ground. There are\r\nseveral gravestones, and it is fairly tidy, the gate being often open.\r\n\r\n273. _Roman Catholic Ground_, New Road.—This also has probably been\r\nencroached upon. What now exists is a yard, ¼ acre in size, between the\r\nschool and the Roman Catholic church, with three graves in one enclosure\r\nin the middle. The gate is open during school hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE CITY.\r\n\r\nI. Burial-grounds which are laid out as public recreation grounds—\r\n\r\n274. _St. Paul’s Cathedral Churchyard._—Used as a burial-place since\r\nRoman times. It includes the Pardon Churchyard, the burial-grounds for\r\nthe parishes of St. Faith and St. Gregory, and a piece allotted to St.\r\nMartin, Ludgate. Size, 1½ acres. Maintained by the Corporation. Laid out\r\nin 1878-1879.\r\n\r\n275. _St. Botolph’s Churchyard_, Aldersgate Street.\r\n\r\n276. _Additional ground for Christ Church_, Newgate Street.\r\n\r\n277. _Additional ground for St. Leonard’s_, Foster Lane.—These three\r\nform together one public garden, rather more than ½ acre in extent. Very\r\nneatly kept up with parochial funds.\r\n\r\n278. _St. Olave’s Churchyard_, Silver Street.—Site of the burned church.\r\n\r\n279. _Allhallows’ Churchyard_, London Wall.\r\n\r\n280. _St. Katharine Coleman Churchyard_, Fenchurch Street.\r\n\r\n281. _St. Botolph’s Churchyard_, Aldgate.—¼ acre.—Four grounds laid out\r\nby the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association.\r\n\r\n281. _St. Botolph’s Churchyard_, Bishopsgate.

No.\r\n282 was laid out by the Association, but the entire cost was borne by\r\nthe parish.\r\n\r\n287. _Additional ground for St. Dunstan’s in the West_, in Fetter Lane.\r\nAsphalted and used as a playground for the Greystoke Place Board School.\r\nSome tombstones remain in an enclosure at the edge. 4,750 square feet in\r\narea.\r\n\r\nII. Burial-grounds that are not laid out as open spaces for the public\r\nuse, although most of them are neatly kept, while a few are used as\r\nstore-yards, &c., and others are open at times—\r\n\r\n288. _The Temple Churchyard._—Partly public thoroughfare, partly closed.\r\n\r\nThe churchyards of—\r\n\r\n289. _St. Andrew_, Holborn.\r\n\r\n290. _Christ Church_, Newgate Street.—On the site of the western end of\r\nthe church of the Greyfriars.\r\n\r\n291. _St. Ann_, Blackfriars.—Two grounds. The western one is the site of\r\nthe burned church.\r\n\r\n292. _St. Andrew by the Wardrobe_, Queen Victoria Street. Very little\r\nleft.\r\n\r\n293. _St. Bartholomew the Great._—On the site of the ancient nave, the\r\n_Green-ground_ on the site of the south transept, and a remnant of the\r\n_Poor ground_ on the north side.\r\n\r\n294. _St. Dionys Backchurch_, Lime Street.\r\n\r\n295. _St. Bartholomew the Less._—In the hospital. At one time it\r\nextended further south.\r\n\r\n296. _St. Giles_, Cripplegate, with the _Green-ground_, an extension to\r\nthe south. Often Open.

(REPRINTED FROM THE\r\n    ANNUAL REPORT OF THE METROPOLITAN PUBLIC GARDENS ASSOCIATION, 83,\r\n    LANCASTER GATE, W.)\r\n\r\n1. Decide how much assistance is to be sought from the London County\r\nCouncil, or the Local Authority, that is the Vestry or District Board,\r\nif in London, or the Urban or Rural Sanitary Authority, if in the\r\nprovinces, in the carrying out of the scheme. Thus, in approaching any\r\nof these bodies, it should be considered—\r\n\r\n    (_a_) Whether they are to be asked to lay out the ground, or only to\r\n    take it over for maintenance after it has been laid out by others,\r\n    _e.g._, the Association.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) Whether they may require, or can have the freehold, or only a\r\n    limited interest, such as a lease of the ground.\r\n\r\n2. The Incumbent or Owner will, when the consent of the Local Authority\r\nor London County Council has been obtained, be required to execute a\r\nDeed transferring the Ground to the Local Authority, or the Council,\r\nupon the terms and conditions that have been mutually arranged.\r\n\r\n3. [Sidenote: Consecrated Grounds require a Faculty.] In the case of a\r\nConsecrated Ground, a Faculty must be obtained from the Bishop of the\r\nDiocese by the Local Authority, or the London County Council, as the\r\ncase may be, permitting such body to exercise powers of management over\r\nit; and should it be needful to move tombstones, such Faculty must also\r\ncontain a license to do so, otherwise they cannot be moved (_vide_ para.\r\n5).\r\n\r\n4. The Consistory Court of the Diocese usually requires the following\r\npreliminary steps to have been taken, before it will hear an application\r\nfor a Faculty:—\r\n\r\n    (_a_) The preparation of a plan and detailed statement of what it is\r\n    proposed to do to the ground, and of an estimate of the expense\r\n    involved.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) The submission of plan, statement, and estimate, to a meeting\r\n    of the Vestry of the Parish, and the passing of a resolution (which\r\n    should be carefully prepared) by the Vestry approving the plan,\r\n    statement, estimate, and application for a Faculty.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) The approval of plan, statement, and estimate, by the Local\r\n    Authority or the London County Council, as the case may be.\r\n\r\n    (_d_) The presentation of a petition for a Faculty to the Bishop or\r\n    his Consistory Court, by the Local Authority or the Council, as the\r\n    case may be, setting out the scheme, accompanied by the plan,\r\n    statement, and resolutions.\r\n\r\n    (_e_) This petition should in the ordinary course have the\r\n    concurrence of the Incumbent, and he may be, and it is usually\r\n    desirable that he should be, a party to it.\r\n\r\n    5. [Sidenote: Removal of Tombstones in consecrated and unconsecrated\r\n    grounds.] In the case of any disused churchyard, cemetery, or\r\n    burial-ground, whether consecrated or not, if tombstones are to be\r\n    moved, at least three months before any tombstone or monument is\r\n    moved the following steps have to be taken:—\r\n\r\n    (_a_) A statement shall be prepared sufficiently describing by the\r\n    name and date appearing thereon the tombstones and monuments\r\n    standing or being in the ground, and such other particulars as may\r\n    be necessary;\r\n\r\n    (_b_) Such statements shall be deposited with the clerk of the\r\n    County Council or Local Authority, and shall be open to inspection\r\n    by all persons;\r\n\r\n    (_c_) An advertisement of the intention to remove or change the\r\n    position of such tombstones and monuments shall be inserted three\r\n    times at least in some newspaper circulating in the neighbourhood of\r\n    the burial-ground, and such advertisement shall give notice of the\r\n    deposit of such statement, as is hereinbefore described, and of the\r\n    hours within which the same may be inspected;\r\n\r\n    (_d_) A notice in terms similar to the advertisement shall be placed\r\n    on the door of the church (if any) to which such churchyard,\r\n    cemetery, or burial-ground is attached, and shall be delivered or\r\n    sent by post to any person known or believed by the County Council\r\n    or Local Authority to be a near relative of any person whose death\r\n    is recorded on any such tombstone or monument.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ditto in consecrated grounds only.] In the case of any\r\nconsecrated ground a Faculty is also required (_vide_ page 3), but no\r\napplication for a Faculty can be made until the expiration of one month\r\nat least after the appearance of the last of such advertisements.\r\n\r\nProvided that on any application for a Faculty nothing shall prevent the\r\nBishop from directing or sanctioning the removal of any tombstone or\r\nmonument, if he is of opinion that reasonable steps have been taken to\r\nbring the intention to effect such removal to the notice of some person\r\nhaving a family interest in such removal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ditto in unconsecrated grounds only.] In the case of an\r\nunconsecrated burial-ground, no Faculty is requisite either for\r\nmanagement or for moving tombstones.\r\n\r\nN.B.—Faculties, which only emanate from the Courts of Diocesan Bishops,\r\ncannot apply to burial-grounds, unless consecrated by Bishops of the\r\nEstablished Church.\r\n\r\n6. [Sidenote: Playing of Games.]The playing of any games or sports is\r\nnot allowed in any churchyard, cemetery, or burial-ground in or over\r\nwhich any estate, interest, or control is acquired under section five of\r\nthe Metropolitan Open Spaces Act, 1881.\r\n\r\nProvided that—\r\n\r\n    (_a_) In the case of consecrated ground, the Bishop, by any license\r\n    or Faculty granted under the Metropolitan Open Spaces Act, 1881, or\r\n    this Act (Open Spaces Act, 1887), and\r\n\r\n    (_b_) In the case of any churchyard, cemetery, or burial-ground,\r\n    which is not consecrated, the body from which any such estate,\r\n    interest, or control as aforesaid is acquired may expressly sanction\r\n    any such use of the ground, and may specify such conditions as to\r\n    the extent or manner of such use.\r\n\r\n    If an Incumbent or owner wishes to lay out a Disused Churchyard or\r\n    Burial-ground, and to maintain it himself directly or by his agents,\r\n    _e.g._, the Association, no application to the Local Authority, or\r\n    London County Council, is required, and if it is a consecrated\r\n    ground but no tombstones are moved, no Faculty or consent of any\r\n    other person is required. Any arrangement of this nature _an\r\n    Incumbent_ may make is not, however, binding on his successor. In\r\n    unconsecrated grounds no Faculties are needed.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              APPENDIX E.\r\n\r\n          THE DISUSED BURIAL-GROUNDS ACT, AND AMENDING CLAUSES IN\r\n                        SUBSEQUENT OPEN SPACES ACTS.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: A.D. 1884.] 47 & 48 VICT.
