We\r\npropose to recount the method pursued by the long succession of scholars\r\nwho in the end succeeded in solving the perplexing problem that was\r\npresented to them. Few, if any, of those who, in the beginning of last\r\ncentury, occupied themselves with the subject, could have imagined the\r\nbrilliant discoveries that would result from their tedious labours. In\r\nthese pages we shall be chiefly occupied with the inscriptions of the\r\nAchaemenian kings. They were the first to be discovered and studied,\r\nand they possess the peculiar advantage of being, with few exceptions,\r\ntrilingual. They are, in fact, generally found in three parallel columns,\r\nand it was seen that the characters and no doubt the languages also\r\nvaried in each. It was observed that the writing in one of the columns\r\nwas much simpler than in the others; the number of different signs being\r\nlimited to about forty-two. It was assumed that they were alphabetical,\r\nwhereas there could be little doubt from their great number that the\r\nsigns in the other columns were syllabic or ideographic. Notwithstanding\r\nthe comparative simplicity of the former, it was not till forty years\r\nhad been devoted to their study that the riddle was successfully solved.\r\nAt length the sound of each letter was fully established, and the words\r\nthey combined to form were found to belong to a language, akin to Zend,\r\nto which the name of Old Persian is now given. From its analogy to\r\nZend and Pehlevi it was a comparatively easy task to assign correct or\r\napproximately correct meanings to the words, and to arrive at the sense\r\nof the short sentences that occur on the monuments. The first stage in\r\nthe progress of decipherment was reached in 1845, when Professor Lassen\r\nof Bonn published a tentative but fairly correct translation of the\r\nwhole of the inscriptions then accessible, belonging to the first or\r\nPersian column. This success was no doubt a matter of great interest to\r\nthe philologist; but the inscriptions themselves were found to be almost\r\nwholly wanting in historical importance. They were nearly all taken\r\nfrom buildings at Persepolis or elsewhere, and they simply commemorated\r\ntheir erection by Darius or by Xerxes or by Artaxerxes Ochus. They are\r\nuniformly conceived in the same set form of words, from which at the\r\nmost some deductions might be drawn as to the relations existing between\r\nthe Persian and his god Ormuzd. Two of them indeed were varied by a list\r\nof the provinces included in the Empire. It is true the inscription at\r\nBehistun was not included in this collection; but even it adds little of\r\nimportance except with reference to the revolt of the Magian impostor.\r\nThe publication of this inscription by Major Rawlinson, in 1846, marks\r\nthe successful termination of the task of deciphering the first column,\r\nand a complete mastery over the Old Persian language had then been\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nIt was correctly supposed that the other two columns contained\r\ntranslations of the same Persian text; and the knowledge now acquired\r\nof the latter could not but afford an invaluable key to unlock the\r\ndifficulties of the others. The decipherment of the inscriptions in the\r\nsecond column was attended by even less interest than the first. The\r\nlanguage was ascertained to be Scythic, but nothing was found written\r\nin it except what was already known from the Persian. It, however, gave\r\nrise to a very heated controversy as to who the people were by whom\r\nit was spoken, which for a time enlivened an otherwise extremely dull\r\nsubject. The decipherment of the third column, however, at length led\r\nto very important consequences that amply compensated for all previous\r\ndisappointments. It was clearly recognised that the writing closely\r\nresembled inscriptions found on bricks that had been picked up from time\r\nto time on the site of Babylon; and hence the third column received, even\r\nin the beginning of the inquiry, the distinctive name of the ‘Babylonian\r\nColumn.’ Only very few specimens of these unilingual inscriptions in the\r\nBabylonian character were collected during the first half of the century,\r\nand no progress was made in their decipherment. Meanwhile, however,\r\nthe study of the third column proceeded with the help of the Persian\r\nkey; and at length the energy of scholars was stimulated by the sudden\r\ndiscovery in Assyria of multitudes of unilingual inscriptions written in\r\na very similar character to that of the Babylonian and the third column.\r\nM. Botta began his excavations at Khorsabad, in 1843, and Mr. Layard at\r\nNineveh, in 1845-6, and from that period there was no lack of material.\r\nThe walls, and even the floors, of the newly discovered palaces were\r\ncovered with long inscriptions which were afterwards found to record the\r\ngreat achievements of their Royal founders. But of far greater interest\r\nand importance than these were the numerous inscribed tablets found in\r\nwhat was called the Library of Assurbanipal. The first stage in the\r\nprogress of this branch of the subject was reached in 1852, when Major\r\nRawlinson published a complete transliteration and translation of the\r\nthird column of the Behistun inscription, followed soon afterwards by\r\ntranslations of a few of the unilingual inscriptions recently found.\r\nThe mastery he had obtained of the language of the third column by\r\nmeans of the Persian key enabled him at length to dispense with its\r\nassistance, and to pass on to the unilingual inscriptions where he had no\r\nsuch guide. He found that the language belonged to the Semitic family,\r\nand it came as a surprise to the learned world of that day to learn\r\nthat the polytheistic nations of the Euphrates Valley spoke a kindred\r\nlanguage to the Hebrew, and belonged presumably to a kindred race. It\r\nwas thus shown that the three languages of the Persian inscriptions\r\nwere representatives, of the Aryan, Turanian and Semitic families. The\r\ndifficulty of the task that remained was still very great, for it was\r\nfound that Babylonian and Assyrian were not exactly the same language,\r\nbut differed from one another at least as much as two strongly marked\r\ndialects of the same speech. The decipherer also was greatly impeded by\r\nvarieties in the method of writing. Two very different systems prevailed\r\nin each country, so that there were in fact four different methods of\r\nwriting the signs to be mastered; and when we consider that the language\r\nis written by means of several hundred signs, it was no trifling matter\r\nto find that each might be multiplied by four.[1] For a long time, no\r\ndoubt, the knowledge of Babylonian and Assyrian remained very imperfect,\r\nbut the labours of many scholars, reaching over fifty years and working\r\nupon the extensive materials gradually accumulating, have cleared up most\r\nof the difficulties, and both are now almost as well understood as any\r\nother ancient language.\r\n\r\nWith so much work still in hand, it was extremely disheartening to\r\nlearn from Major Rawlinson that he had descried yet another and totally\r\ndifferent language in certain inscriptions sent to him from Southern\r\nBabylonia. The intelligence was confirmed shortly afterwards by the\r\ndiscovery in the Library of Assurbanipal of large numbers of tablets that\r\nserved as phrase-books for the acquisition of this newly found language.\r\nFarther investigation showed that it belonged to the Turanian family;\r\nand it has received the names of Akkadian and Sumerian. Some years\r\nlater the cities of Southern Babylonia were more thoroughly explored,\r\nespecially Tello, by M. de Sarzec, and the number of inscriptions in\r\nthis language largely increased. They are found written in a linear\r\nor archaic character that evidently preceded the use of cuneiform.\r\nThe conclusion was soon reached that this Turanian language was the\r\noriginal language of Southern Babylonia, and that the cuneiform writing\r\ndeveloped from its ancient script. But still more surprising was the\r\ndiscovery that not merely the writing but the religion and literature of\r\nlater times descended from this ancient source. An immense collection\r\nof tablets has been made from the various libraries of Babylonia and\r\nAssyria, upon which a large and varied literature is inscribed. It\r\nconsists of epic poems, legends of creation, astronomical books, legal\r\njudgments and contracts. In the field of religion it comprises magical\r\nincantations, hymns and penitential psalms. But it was found that all\r\nthe most important part of this literature was simply translated from\r\nthe Sumerian, and that Assyrian literature proper is limited to the dry\r\nand monotonous records of the kings. It is not the least interesting\r\nresult of these studies to have shown that the Turanian race lies at the\r\nback of the civilisation of Western Asia. From them the Semitic races\r\nof the valley of the two rivers derived their law, their religion, the\r\nlegends of their faith, their heroic literature, their science and art,\r\nand all the chief elements of their culture. Scarcely less surprising\r\nwas the discovery of the immense antiquity of the Sumerian civilisation.\r\nThe evidence derived from the cuneiform documents, combined with the\r\nresults of the excavations carefully conducted at Nippur by Dr. Peters\r\nand others, have carried back the beginnings of Sumerian history to an\r\nalmost incredible antiquity, sometimes estimated at B.C. 6000.[2] From\r\nthe written documents now in our possession, we are able to reconstruct\r\nthe records of Southern Babylonia from about B.C. 4000, and an entirely\r\nnew page in the history of the human race has been opened. We can trace\r\nthe beginnings of civilisation among the lagoons of the Persian Gulf,\r\nthe rise of a great commerce with the Mediterranean, with Egypt, and\r\npossibly with India; the descent of the Semitic nomads into the rich\r\ncities created by the industry of the Turanian population; the foundation\r\nof a Babylonian Empire reaching across to the Mediterranean at a period\r\nstill anterior to the reputed age of Abraham. We can note many incidents\r\nin the struggle for the possession of Syria in which Egypt for a time\r\nremained the victor. We assist at the foundation of the infant kingdom\r\nof Assyria some 2000 years after our records begin; all the events of\r\nits rise and fall are engraved on our imperishable books of stone, and\r\nmany incidents in the writings of the Jews have received illustration.\r\nFinally, on the fall of Assyria we see the old Empire of Babylon recover\r\nfrom its partial eclipse and flourish for a time under the great\r\nNebuchadnezzar. Then follow the rise of Persia and the extinction of\r\nthe great Semitic Empires, events on which our cuneiform records have\r\nthrown new and important light. Considering that the existence of the old\r\nBabylonian Empire was previously entirely unknown; that our knowledge of\r\nthe Assyrian Empire hitherto depended altogether on a few passages in the\r\nHebrew Scriptures, and some absurd legends collected by Herodotus and\r\nCtesias; that the very existence of a second Babylonian Empire seems to\r\nhave entirely escaped the knowledge of the Greeks, we are in a position\r\nto estimate the gain to the range of our historical information. The\r\ninscriptions have also shown the origin of many myths popular in ancient\r\ntimes; and of legends that even still enter into current theology. They\r\nhave exhibited the Semitic people in the new light of a polytheistic\r\nrace, and they have illustrated the important position filled by the\r\nTuranians at the dawn of civilisation.\r\n\r\nIt was only natural that the accuracy of many of these results should\r\nhave been somewhat strenuously contested. M. Renan, for example, could\r\nnot be induced to believe in the polytheism of the Semitic race, though\r\nthe images of their gods began to crowd the Louvre in bewildering\r\nnumbers. M. Halévy disputed the very existence of the Sumerian race and\r\nlanguage, and the controversy he excited has not even yet wholly died\r\naway. Others cannot reconcile themselves to the subordinate position\r\nof the Semite to the Turanian in laying the foundations of all modern\r\nculture, and they still endeavour to show that the two races were at\r\nleast contemporary workers from the earliest times, and contributed\r\nequally to the great result. All this is perhaps symptomatic only of a\r\npassing phase of irritation, for the evidence on the other side seems too\r\noverwhelming to be long withstood.[3]\r\n\r\nIt is because the trilingual inscriptions have rendered such important\r\nservice that we have considered it worth while to recount the history\r\nof their discovery after they had lain forgotten for some two thousand\r\nyears, and to explain the steps that were taken in the work of\r\ndecipherment by the many scholars whose patient toil was ultimately\r\nrewarded with success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRILINGUAL CUNEIFORM INSCRIPTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE DISCOVERY OF ACHAEMENIAN RUINS AND INSCRIPTIONS—BARBARO TO LE BRUYN,\r\nA.D. 1472-1718\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trilingual inscriptions of the Achaemenian Kings of Persia that have\r\nled to the decipherment of the whole cuneiform literature were found\r\nchiefly at Persepolis and Behistun; though a single line at Murgab and\r\na short inscription at Hamadan, the ancient Ecbatana, also contributed\r\nto an important extent. Other inscriptions were observed at Van in\r\nArmenia; at Naksh-i-Rustam, a few miles from Persepolis; upon the site of\r\nthe ancient Susa, and so far afield as Egypt. They are all monumental:\r\nchiselled upon the walls of buildings to record the name of the king\r\nwho erected the edifice. They are written in three different methods\r\nof cuneiform writing, and reproduce the same text in three different\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\nThe inscriptions at Persepolis were the first to attract attention. The\r\nruins where they were found had excited curiosity long before their\r\ndiscovery by European travellers, and many legends had arisen to account\r\nfor their origin. It was variously reported that they were the remains\r\nof a palace of Solomon, or of Cai Caius, a predecessor of Cyrus, or\r\nof the great national hero Jamshid. The literary classes described\r\nthem as the Takht-i-Cai Khusrau, or Throne of Cyrus; and later on as\r\nthe Khaneh-i-Dara or Mansion of Darius. The early travellers, however,\r\nlearned that the popular name for them was Chehel Minar, or Forty\r\nMinarets, from the lofty columns that form their chief architectural\r\ncharacteristic. But during the eighteenth century Jamshid triumphed\r\nover all his competitors, and since then they have been more generally\r\nknown as the Takht-i-Jamshid, or Throne of Jamshid. The question of\r\ntheir origin was not indeed finally settled till the inscriptions were\r\ninterpreted. Chardin, at the end of the seventeenth century, and Heeren,\r\na hundred years later, still supported the claims of Jamshid. Although\r\nit no longer admits of doubt that the buildings were erected by Darius\r\nand Xerxes, there is even yet no complete unanimity as to their original\r\ndesign. The more common belief is that they were the actual palaces\r\nof the sovereign, and that one of the buildings was the scene of the\r\nconflagration ordered by Alexander. Their dimensions and construction\r\noffer considerable difficulties to the supposition that they were the\r\nactual residence of the great king, though they may have been adapted for\r\nofficial receptions and other ceremonial purposes.\r\n\r\nThey lie on the south-east slope of a hill overlooking the plain of\r\nMervdasht about forty miles north of Shiraz. Many other remains belonging\r\nto the same period are found on both sides of the neighbouring river\r\nPolvar. Three miles further up are the ruins of the fortress city of\r\nIstakhr; and four miles across the river are the Tombs of Naksh-i-Rustam.\r\nDoubtless the great city of Persepolis included within its circuit the\r\nwhole of these isolated ruins, though the name has become restricted to\r\nthose that now specially engage our attention. They rise upon a terrace\r\npartly hewn from the solid rock, partly constructed of massive blocks\r\nof stone. They now consist chiefly of the colossal jambs of doors and\r\nwindows, the connecting walls having entirely disappeared. Their chief\r\ncharacteristics are the beautiful columns that formerly gave the place\r\nits name, and the profusion of bas-reliefs that ornament the stonework.\r\nThe platform is of very irregular shape, and is encased by a magnificent\r\nwall varying in height from twenty to fifty feet. It is approached from\r\nthe plain on the west side by (1) a Double Staircase sunk into the line\r\nof the wall and rising parallel to it. At the summit is (2) a Porch\r\nentered between two buttresses supported by colossal bulls; beyond are\r\ntwo other buttresses with winged, human-headed bulls looking in the\r\nopposite direction towards the east. In the centre of the edifice marked\r\nby these two entrances there were originally four columns designed to\r\nsupport the roof, of which two only are now standing. Turning to the\r\nright, towards the south, is (3) a Sculptured Staircase leading up to\r\nthe Columnar Edifice. It differs from the one already mentioned by\r\nstanding out considerably from the line of the terrace; indeed there are\r\ntwo projections, the first no less than two hundred and twelve feet in\r\nlength; the second, which again projects from the centre of the first, is\r\neighty-six feet in length. At either end of each projection is a single\r\nflight of steps; and the whole front is seen to be completely covered\r\nwith bas-reliefs. Beneath the landing stage of the central projection\r\nthe wall is divided into three compartments. In the centre is a plain\r\npolished slab intended for an inscription, and on either side are armed\r\nguards. In the spandrils formed by the ascent of the steps is a favourite\r\ndevice representing a contest between a lion and a bull. On the wall\r\nto right and left of the central stairs are three horizontal rows of\r\nbas-reliefs separated by an ornamental design of roses. They represent\r\na procession of tributaries, leading animals or bearing gifts, about to\r\nascend the central stairs. At either end is a polished slab occupying\r\nthe whole height of the wall; but only the one to the west has been\r\nfilled with an inscription. The Columnar Edifice (4), standing on the\r\nterrace above, is designed in the form of a Central Cluster and three\r\ncolonnades—one in front and one on either side. The centre formed a\r\nsquare of thirty-six columns, and each of the colonnades consisted of\r\ntwo rows of six columns. The total number of columns should therefore\r\nbe seventy-two, of which only thirteen now remain standing. They differ\r\nin height, and belong to two different orders. Those in the front\r\ncolonnade and central group are lower than the others, and have a capital\r\nresembling the Ionic order, except that the volutes rise perpendicularly.\r\nIn the colonnades a double bull or unicorn rests directly upon the shaft;\r\nand it has been generally assumed that similar animals were originally\r\nsuperimposed over the voluted capital to make the other columns of equal\r\nheight. The edifice covered an area of three hundred and fifty feet\r\nfrom east to west, and two hundred and forty-six feet from north to\r\nsouth. Passing through the columns, and continuing in the same southerly\r\ndirection, the ruins are reached that have yielded the largest number\r\nof inscriptions. First in order are the massive jambs belonging to the\r\nbuilding now known as (5) the Palace of Darius; and beyond are the\r\nremains of three buildings lining the southern terrace. The one to the\r\nright is the scarcely discernible ruins of (6) the Palace of Ochus. In\r\nthe centre rise the huge pilasters of the great (7) Palace of Xerxes;\r\nwhile beyond to the left is a small ruin called (8) the South-eastern\r\nEdifice. Turning back towards the north, between these ruins and the\r\nhill are the ruins of (9) the Central Edifice, a building resembling the\r\nPorch at the summit of the entrance. Beyond, in a line with the Columnar\r\nEdifice are the huge remains of the (10) Hall of the Hundred Columns. On\r\nthe hill overhanging the Platform are two rock tombs similar to those at\r\nNaksh-i-Rustam; and, above, some travellers have traced three distinct\r\nwalls and towers that formed the defence of the palace and city.\r\n\r\nThe palaces stand upon an artificial terrace of their own raised above\r\nthe level of the platform, and the stairs leading up to them have\r\nafforded an opportunity for the display of ornamentation in bas-relief.\r\nThe Porch is invariably protected by colossal guards hewn out of the\r\nstone. Over the great door of the main entrances the king is depicted\r\nentering or leaving the building, with attendants bearing the royal\r\nparasol and fly-chaser. On the doors leading to the lateral chambers he\r\nmay be seen in dignified conflict with wild animals; or, as in the Palace\r\nof Xerxes, these scenes are replaced by attendants bearing viands to the\r\nroyal table. Some of the most elaborate designs are met in the Central\r\nEdifice and in the Hall of the Hundred Columns. In the latter the king\r\nappears seated in a chair of state raised above the heads of five rows of\r\nwarriors; while at the opposite door his throne is similarly supported by\r\nthree rows of figures representing subject nations. These bas-reliefs are\r\nsurrounded by an exquisite fretted fringe of roses, diversified above by\r\nsmall figures of bulls and lions; and over the whole the winged figure of\r\nOrmuzd is seen to hover.\r\n\r\nA large inscription occupies the outside wall of the southern terrace.\r\nIt is in four tablets, known as the H, I, K and L of Niebuhr. The I\r\ninscription enumerates the provinces of Darius: another contains the\r\ndeclaration that that Terrace or Fortress was built by Darius, and,\r\n‘before him there was not any fortress in that place.’[4] Above the\r\nanimals in the Porch is an inscription of Xerxes in three tablets,\r\ndeclaring that it was erected by him, and that it was one of the many\r\nbeautiful works accomplished by him and his father Darius ‘in Parsa’\r\n(Inscription D). The unilingual inscription on the sculptured staircase\r\ninforms us that it also was constructed by Xerxes (Inscription A). As\r\nwe ascend the south stairs to the Palace of Darius, we observe on the\r\nfaçade below the landing stage three tablets of inscriptions which are\r\nrepeated upon the landing, on the anta in the south-west corner. It is\r\nagain Xerxes who speaks, but he tells us that it was Darius who erected\r\nthat palace (Inscriptions C and Cᵃ). Passing through the great doors we\r\nobserve above the king and his attendants three tablets of inscriptions.\r\nThey are in the three languages and run: ‘Darius, the great king, king\r\nof kings, king of nations, son of Hystaspes, the Achaemenian, has built\r\nthis palace’ (Inscription B). Within, round the doors and windows is\r\na single-line inscription written on the top in Persian, ascending\r\non the left in Susian and descending on the right hand in Babylonian\r\n(Inscription L). On the west side of this palace is a second staircase,\r\nadded later, of Artaxerxes Ochus, as we learn from a magnificent\r\ninscription on the façade (Inscription P). This inscription is repeated\r\non the stairs leading to the palace of that king.[5] Adjoining the latter\r\nis the Palace of Xerxes, approached by two principal staircases, one to\r\nthe east and the other to the west. On both occur inscriptions declaring\r\nXerxes the builder in words repeated upon the wall above and upon the\r\nanta of the great Portico (Inscription E). Entering by the great doors\r\nwe see a short inscription over the king and his attendants, which is\r\nrepeated over the side doors and windows and even upon the royal robe\r\n(Inscription G).\r\n\r\nThese inscriptions, as we have said, do little more than record the name\r\nof the founders, and with the exception of the I inscription, they give\r\nno other information. But they are sometimes accompanied by a religious\r\nformula consisting of two paragraphs, of which occasionally the second\r\nonly is given. It runs:\r\n\r\n1. ‘A great god is Auramazda who has created this heaven, who has created\r\nthis earth, who has created men, who has created happiness for men, who\r\nhas made Darius [or Xerxes] King, the only King among many, the only\r\nruler of many.\r\n\r\n2. ‘I am Darius [or Xerxes] the great King, the King of Kings, the King\r\nof the lands of many races, King of this great earth far and near; son of\r\nHystaspes [or Darius] the Achaemenian.’\r\n\r\nThe inscription at Hamadan contains nothing else.\r\n\r\nThe early travellers were attracted by Naksh-i-Rustam almost as early as\r\nby the Chehel Minar. It lies, as we have said, about four miles distant,\r\nacross the Polvar, and no doubt it formed part of the great city. The\r\nbas-reliefs that excited the most curiosity belong to the Sassanian\r\nperiod and do not concern us here; but the tombs are Achaemenian. They\r\nare executed in the face of the rock and are four in number. They are\r\ncomprised within a space of two hundred yards, and in exterior design\r\nthey are precisely alike. They are in the shape of a Greek cross, and\r\nthe transverse section reproduces in half relief the façade of a palace.\r\nIn the topmost section there rests a rectangular stage ornamented with\r\ntwo rows of human figures, each containing fourteen persons in different\r\ncostumes, designed to represent the various satrapies of the Empire. Upon\r\nit the king is seen standing on a dais; before him is an altar upon which\r\nthe sacred fire is burning, and above floats the image of Ormuzd. The\r\nsecond tomb from the east is the only one that bears an inscription, and\r\nfrom it we learn that it was the resting place of the great Darius. The\r\nfaçade has four tablets of inscriptions, two in Persian and one each in\r\nthe Susian and Babylonian languages. The Persian text inscribed in the\r\nupper limb of the cross is the best preserved and the most difficult of\r\naccess. It consists of sixty lines and contains a second and later list\r\nof the provinces of the Empire (Inscription NR). Beneath it, between the\r\nhalf columns in the transverse section, is another Persian inscription,\r\noriginally of about the same length, but so mutilated that only fifteen\r\nlines have been partly copied (Inscription NR ᵇ). The names of three of\r\nthe great officers of the Crown have also been recovered (Inscriptions NR\r\nᶜ, ᵈ, ᵉ), and quite recently the names of seven supporters of the throne\r\nhave been added.\r\n\r\nAscending the valley of the Polvar, at a distance of forty miles to\r\nthe north of Persepolis the traveller reaches another large group\r\nof Achaemenian ruins, which it is now generally admitted represent\r\nPasargadae, the city of Cyrus. The early travellers were attracted by a\r\ncurious edifice standing among them which they were told was the Tomb\r\nof the Mother of Solomon; but it was not till the nineteenth century\r\nthat its similarity to the tomb of Cyrus, described by Arrian, struck\r\nthe imaginative Morier, the author of ‘Hajji Baba.’ At the same time a\r\nsingle-line inscription was found repeated on several pillars with the\r\nlegend: ‘I am Cyrus, the King, the Achaemenian’ (Inscription M).\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the Achaemenian ruins and inscriptions, to which we have\r\nbriefly called attention, dates from the beginning of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. Till then Persia was almost entirely unknown to European\r\ntravellers, and only a few scattered notices of the Persepolitan ruins\r\ncome to us earlier. The first of these dates back to the end of the\r\nfifteenth century, and is due to a Venetian ambassador, Giosafat Barbaro,\r\nwho visited the country in 1472. The account of his mission was not,\r\nhowever, published till 1545. He tells us that a day’s journey from\r\nCamara he came to a great bridge across the ‘Bindamyr,’ which he heard\r\nhad been built by Solomon.[6] Not far distant he perceived a hill where\r\non a level spot, stood forty columns, called from that circumstance\r\n‘Cilminar.’ Some of them are in ruins, but from what remains it is\r\nevident the building was formerly very beautiful. Above the terrace there\r\nrises a rock on which human figures of gigantic size are sculptured,\r\nand over them appears a figure which resembles ‘God the Father in a\r\ncircle.’[7] Elsewhere he observed a tall figure on horseback who he was\r\ntold was Samson, and others clothed after the French fashion. ‘Two days\r\ndistant from this place is a place called Thimar, and another two days\r\nfarther we come to a village where there is a sepulchre, in which they\r\nsay the mother of Solomon is buried. Upon it is a kind of chapel on which\r\nare engraven Arabic characters denoting “Mother of Solomon.” This place\r\nthey call Messeth Suleimen, or Temple of Solomon. The door looks towards\r\nthe east.’ Such is the earliest account in modern times of the famous\r\nruins of Persepolis and Pasargadae, although Barbaro was quite unaware of\r\ntheir identity. It will be observed that he also visited Naksh-i-Rustam,\r\nand saw in the Sassanian bas-relief of Rustam the figure of Samson. It\r\nis possible that the notes of his journey were fuller than the published\r\naccount, and they may have fallen into the hands of Sebastiano Serlio, a\r\nBolognese architect. A few years before the appearance of the ‘Viagi,’\r\nSerlio published his celebrated treatise on Architecture, which enjoyed\r\nextraordinary popularity, and was translated into many languages.[8] In\r\nit he gives a drawing of the façade of an edifice which he had heard\r\nwas supported by a hundred columns. He had never seen it or its ruins,\r\nand seems to have had no idea where the building had stood, though he\r\napparently gives us to understand that it was Grecian. The drawing shows\r\na building with ten columns in front, adorned with Corinthian capitals,\r\nand supporting a second story of four columns and architrave. He had\r\nheard that only a few of the columns remained above ground, but he\r\ndecided to present his readers with his conception of what it must have\r\nresembled. He ventures so far as to give the dimensions of the columns,\r\nalthough he anticipates that the whole thing will be flouted as a chimera\r\nor a dream. He thus gives us the first of a long series of conjectural\r\n‘restorations,’ with which successive generations of architects have\r\nenlivened their books and obscured the subject in hand. He is certain\r\nthat some such building with a hundred columns had existed somewhere, but\r\nit never seems to have entered his mind that he had to go so far afield\r\nas Persia to find it. Whether the idea was suggested by what he had heard\r\nfrom Barbaro we cannot say; but it is a complete error to suppose that\r\nhe represented his drawing as ‘the plan and elevation of Persepolis.’[9]\r\nThe first to suggest the identity was Don Garcia, who, however, does not\r\nappear to have read what Serlio had to say on the subject.[10] He thought\r\nSerlio had called his drawing the ‘Forty Alcorans’ and omitted its\r\nsize and proportion. Serlio, on the contrary, says nothing about forty\r\ncolumns, and he gives the proportions of his imaginary edifice, which he\r\nleaves us to infer was one of the marvels of Greece.\r\n\r\nIt was not till the Portuguese found their way round the Cape of Good\r\nHope that communication with Persia became regular and frequent. In 1508,\r\nAlboquerque conquered the island of Ormuz at the entrance to the Persian\r\nGulf. Even at that time this barren rock was the resort of merchants from\r\nIndia; and under Portuguese rule it rapidly rose to great prosperity.\r\nIts king was permitted to retain his rank and a nominal authority, but\r\nhis dominions, which included the islands of Kesem and Bahrein and the\r\nport of Gombrun on the mainland passed under Portuguese influence. In\r\nthe division of the East among the religious orders, Persia fell to the\r\nAugustinians, to be the special field of their missionary labours. They\r\nerected a church and convent at Ormuz, which continued for a hundred\r\nyears to be a centre of their activity. In the reign of Don Sebastian\r\nthe Father Symon de Morales became its prior and applied himself to\r\nthe acquisition of the Persian language. Soon after the union of the\r\nPortuguese and Spanish thrones, Philip II. instructed the Viceroy of the\r\nIndies to send an envoy to the King of Persia in order to settle the\r\ndetails of the commercial intercourse which had arisen between the two\r\ncountries, and no one was better qualified to undertake the task than\r\nMorales, upon whom the selection fell (1583). The route from Ormuz to\r\nIspahan, then the capital of Persia, passed within a short distance of\r\nPersepolis; and it is to the long succession of envoys who travelled that\r\nway that we are in great measure indebted for our knowledge of these\r\nruins and the mysterious characters engraven upon their walls.\r\n\r\nThe missions took place chiefly in the reign of Shah Abbas (1587-1628),\r\na monarch whose alliance against the Turk was eagerly sought for by the\r\nEuropean powers. He had not only distinguished himself in the early part\r\nof his reign by considerable military capacity, but had evinced a strong\r\ndesire to develop the commercial resources of his country. Indeed, he\r\nwas as much of a merchant as a soldier. He was the chief, if not the\r\nsole, owner of the silk industry, and he sought to attract the merchants\r\nof all nations by permitting the freest competition among them. He did\r\neverything in his power to render the country agreeable to strangers. He\r\nerected sumptuous caravansaries for their accommodation upon the road.\r\nHe made travelling even in remote districts absolutely safe, by the\r\nslaughter, it was said, of twenty thousand robbers. He received men of\r\nall nationalities and of the most diverse creeds with equal hospitality.\r\nHe even sought to attract skilled artisans from Europe to instruct his\r\nsubjects, and he caused his palaces to be decorated by foreign artists.\r\nThe period of his reign was peculiarly favourable for the execution of\r\nhis liberal projects. The Portuguese trade was carried on with great\r\nsuccess from Ormuz. About 1595 the Dutch made their first appearance in\r\nthe Indian Seas, and gave a great stimulus to competition. Nor were the\r\nEnglish merchants indifferent to the opening of a new market. So far back\r\nas 1861 Antonie Jenkinson visited Persia with that object, but he was\r\nnot favourably received. In the first year of the seventeenth century,\r\nJohn Mildenhall, accompanied by John Cartwright, a student of Magdalen,\r\nrenewed the overtures, and they found Shah Abbas even then well disposed\r\nto cede a port on the Gulf. In 1609, Joseph Salbancke again reported\r\nfavourably of the commercial prospects if an English fleet could contend\r\nsuccessfully against the Portuguese and Dutch. At length the East India\r\nCompany, which was founded in 1600, succeeded in opening the trade in\r\n1614, and from that year a British Resident was regularly established\r\nat Ispahan. It thus happened that both political events and commercial\r\nenterprise concurred at the same time to bring Persia into communication\r\nwith Europe, and a country that only a few years before was scarcely\r\nknown became the frequent resort of travellers.\r\n\r\nIn 1601, Philip II. thought it advisable to renew diplomatic intercourse\r\nwith this great monarch, and he instructed the Viceroy at Goa to despatch\r\na second mission to Ispahan. The Viceroy chose three Augustinian friars,\r\namong whom was Antoine de Gouvea, who has left an interesting account of\r\nhis travels. Gouvea was the Rector of the College of Goa, and Professor\r\nof Theology, and he had acquired a competent knowledge of Persian. The\r\nparty landed at Ormuz early in 1602, and set out in May to join the king,\r\nbut they turned aside from the direct route to visit ‘Chelminira,’ or the\r\nForty Columns, which he believed to be the ‘sepulchre of an old king\r\nwho was buried here.’[11] He found, however, that the tomb was on the\r\nside of the mountain, and was generally attributed to Cyrus. He thought\r\nit was more probably to be assigned to Assuerus or Artaxerxes, and the\r\ntomb close by to his wife, Queen Vasti. The ruins of the Forty Columns\r\nwere locally known as ‘the Old Town,’ and it was thought that it had been\r\nthe original site of Shiraz. Old writers confirmed this view, because\r\nthey said the river Bondamiro[12] (which passes near the ruins) ‘washed\r\nthe walls of Shiraz.’ Gouvea, following the geographical writers of the\r\ntime, had no doubt that Shiraz was the ancient Persepolis. It never\r\noccurred to him to connect it with ‘the old town’ of Chelminar, to which\r\ntradition pointed as the original site of Shiraz. He called attention to\r\nthe magnificent staircase that leads from the plain to the platform on\r\nwhich the ruins stand. Two staircases, he says, rise from the foot of the\r\nmountain, _vis-à-vis_ one to the other, consisting of numerous steps well\r\nadjusted, and cut out of immense blocks of stone. The two stairs converge\r\nto one common landing place; and, writing evidently from memory, he adds\r\nthat the sides are adorned with figures in relief, so well made that ‘he\r\ndoubts if it were possible to execute them better.’ The Porch is, he\r\nsays, adorned with ‘figures of savage animals cut out of a single block,\r\nand so lifelike that they appear as though they desired to excite fear.’\r\nHe describes the columns as surmounted by beautiful statues. On the\r\nPortico and in various places among the ruins he saw the portrait of the\r\nking. He does not mention any of the ruins on the platform; they appear\r\nall to come under the comprehensive description of ‘chapels,’ which he\r\nsays were built of huge blocks of stone. But he noticed the two tombs\r\non the hill, one being ‘the sepulchre of the king, which is not very\r\ndifferent from the other.’ He confuses the great entrance stairs leading\r\nto the Porch with the sculptured stairs leading to the Court of the\r\nColumns; and represents it as approached directly through the Porch. It\r\nwas a long time before this error was cleared up. Gouvea called attention\r\nto the inscriptions. ‘The writing,’ he says, ‘may be clearly seen in\r\nmany places, and it may explain by whom the building was erected and the\r\npurpose it was intended to serve; but there is no one who can understand\r\nit, because the characters are neither Persian, Arabic, Armenian, nor\r\nHebrew, the languages now in use in the district; so that everything\r\ncontributes to obliterate the knowledge of that which the ambitious\r\nprince desired to render eternal.’\r\n\r\nWhen Gouvea arrived at the Court, which was then at Machad, the capital\r\nof Khorassan (or Bactria), he was met by Robert Sherley, an Englishman,\r\nwho was then not more than twenty years of age. Sherley, we hear, was\r\nnaturally of good disposition, though infected by the pestiferous errors\r\nhe had imbibed in England.[13] He was no match in argument for the\r\nProfessor of Theology, and after some discussion ‘he was converted and\r\nsubmitted to the Roman Church with seven or eight of his suite.’ Gouvea,\r\nas was natural, attributed great importance to these conversions, and\r\nalthough he publicly declared that the primary object of his mission was\r\nto kindle a war with the Turk, he lost no opportunity of assuring the\r\nking that his heart was set much more on ‘teaching the knowledge of the\r\ntrue God.’ He presented his Majesty with a ‘Life of Our Lord,’ richly\r\nbound, and certain religious pictures sent by the Archbishop of Goa;\r\nand he continued, in season and out of season, to press the faith upon\r\nhis acceptance. The Shah, who was surrounded by Christians both in the\r\nharem and the Court, treated these importunities with toleration, and his\r\ncourtesy encouraged the zealous priest to hope that he might number him\r\namong his converts.[14] A Persian merchant, who noticed with surprise the\r\ncivility of the king towards Christians, had already circulated a report\r\nin Italy of his approaching admission into the Church, and Gouvea was\r\nsurprised to meet at Ispahan with an embassy of Carmelite fathers sent\r\nby Clement VIII., with instructions to arrange the details attending the\r\nconversion of the country. These extravagances prejudiced the position\r\nof the Portuguese fathers, and they found that the Shah was beginning to\r\ngrow weary of the whole affair. He, however, granted them leave to turn a\r\nlarge disused palace into a monastery, and to build a church.\r\n\r\nGouvea quitted Ispahan in company with a Persian envoy bound for Spain,\r\nwho was the bearer of a letter from the Shah to Philip. The two other\r\nfathers remained behind to supervise the interests of their community.\r\nWhile Gouvea was still on his way to the coast, he received the pleasing\r\nnews that war between Turkey and Persia had actually broken out.\r\n\r\nThe war was carried on by Rudolph in Europe and Abbas in Asia, till 1607,\r\nwhen the Emperor concluded the Peace of Sitvatorok, without consulting\r\nthe convenience of his ally. The Shah was extremely displeased by an\r\nact that, without any warning, left him to bear the whole brunt of the\r\ncampaign. It was while he was still suffering from the unfaithfulness\r\nof his European allies that Gouvea appeared for the second time at his\r\nCourt. He left Goa in February 1608, and arrived at Ispahan in June; but\r\nit was with difficulty he could obtain an interview with the Shah. On his\r\nreturn to Portugal he was raised to the bishopric of Cyrene. He wrote his\r\nbook in 1609, before he left Goa, and he evidently brought it with him to\r\nLisbon, where it was published in 1611.\r\n\r\nAt the Spanish Court he had an opportunity of meeting Don Garcia de\r\nSilva Figueroa, who was subsequently to visit Persia as Ambassador, and\r\nto interest him in the ruins of Chehel Minar. In view of his projected\r\njourney, Don Garcia made a special study of the antiquities of the\r\ncountry in the original authorities, and in such modern books as were\r\nthen available. He was a Castilian of high rank, and about fifty-seven\r\nyears of age at the time he left on his mission, in 1614. He had an\r\nextremely difficult part to play, and one little suited to his haughty\r\nand irascible temper. The Portuguese authorities were greatly incensed at\r\nthe appointment of a Spaniard, and they threw every obstacle in his way.\r\nThe Viceroy detained him at Goa on one pretext or another from November\r\n1614 to March 1617, when at length the Ambassador hazarded the voyage\r\nto Ormuz in a small vessel of two hundred tons.[15] On his arrival he\r\nfound the Portuguese governor of the island nearly as intractable as the\r\nViceroy, and it was not till October that he was able to continue his\r\njourney. He passed that winter at Shiraz, which he said was certainly\r\nthe Cyropolis of the ancients and the place of burial of Cyrus, its\r\nfounder. He found his sojourn intolerably dull: he complains that there\r\nwas ‘not as much as any bookes except a few pamphlets intreating of Holy\r\nConfession, and Navarr’s Summes which the monkes of St. Augustine use.’\r\nIn April 1618, he set out for Ispahan, and reached the bridge across the\r\n‘Bradamir,’ which river he had no doubt was the ancient Araxes. A league\r\nfurther on he came to the ruins of ‘Chelminara,’ of which he had heard\r\nso much from Gouvea. He did not hesitate to identify them at once with\r\n‘those huge wilde buildings of the castle and Palace of Persepolis’;\r\nand he appears to have been the first to make this identification.[16]\r\nGouvea, as we have seen, had no doubt that Shiraz was built on the site\r\nof Persepolis. Cartwright, to whose journey we have already alluded, was\r\nso convinced of the same that he heads a chapter ‘Description of Sieras,\r\nancient Persepolis,’ and adds: ‘This is the city Alexander burnt at the\r\nrequest of a drunken strumpet, himself being the first president in that\r\nwofull misery.’[17]\r\n\r\nDon Garcia is warm in his praise of ‘this rare yea and onely monument of\r\nthe world (which farre exceedeth all the rest of the world’s miracles\r\nthat we have seen or heard off).’ He found only twenty of the pillars\r\nleft standing, but there were broken remains of many others close by; and\r\nhalf a league distant in the plain he noted another, and still farther\r\noff two short ones. He mentions the numerous bas-reliefs that ‘doe seele\r\nthe front, the sides and the statlier parts of this building.’ The human\r\nfigures are ‘deckt with a very comely clothing and clad in the same\r\nfashion which the Venetian magnificoes goe in: that is gownes down to\r\nthe heeles with wide sleeves, with round flat caps, their hair spred to\r\nthe shoulders and notable long beards.’ Some are seated in ‘loftier\r\nchayres’ with a ‘little footstoole neatly made about a hand high.’ He was\r\nparticularly struck by the ‘hardnesse and durablenesse of these Marbles\r\nand Jaspers so curiously wrought and polished that yee may see your\r\nface in them as in a glasse.’ He was embarrassed to define the style of\r\narchitecture, ‘whether Corinthian, Ionick, Dorick, or mixt.’ He called\r\nespecial attention to ‘one notable inscription cut in a Jasper Table,\r\nwith characters still so fresh and faire that one would wonder how it\r\ncould scape so many ages without touch of the least blemish. The letters\r\nthemselves are neither Chaldæan, nor Hebrew, nor Greeke nor Arabike, nor\r\nof any other nation which was ever found of old or at this day to be\r\nextant. They are all three-cornered, but somewhat long, of the form of\r\na Pyramide, or such a little obeliske as I have set in the margin (△),\r\nso that in nothing doe they differ from one another but in their placing\r\nand situation.’ He notes that the threefold circle of walls said to have\r\nsurrounded the castle ‘hath yielded to the time and weather.’ He mentions\r\nalso the Tombs. ‘There stand,’ he says, ‘the sepulchres of their Kings\r\nplaced on the side of that hill at the foote whereof the Castle itself\r\nis built.’ He did not himself visit Naksh-i-Rustam, but apparently his\r\nservants went, and ‘did see some horses of marble, large like a Colossus\r\nand some men also of giantly stature.’ This description is taken from\r\na letter written by Don Garcia from Ispahan in 1619 to a friend at\r\nVenice. It was published at Antwerp in the following year, and appeared\r\nin English in 1625, in Purchas’ Pilgrims. A more detailed account is\r\nfound in the ‘Embassy of Don Garcia,’ a work elaborated from his notes\r\nor memoirs by a member of his suite, and translated into French in 1667.\r\nIt contains a very full, and on the whole accurate, description of the\r\nruins. He noticed the irregular slope of the terrace, which he attributed\r\nto the exigencies of defence. The double staircase leading to the\r\nplatform is so constructed that ‘one can easily ride up on horseback.’ On\r\nreaching the summit he noticed the Porch, the walls of which, he said,\r\nare supported by two great horses in white marble, larger than elephants,\r\neach with two wings, and with eyes expressive of the dignity of the lion.\r\nBeyond is another door adorned in the same manner, and exactly between\r\nthe two stands a large column on its pedestal.[18] The Porch leads to\r\nthe Columnar Edifice, where he saw twenty-seven columns still standing\r\n(not, as Purchas says, twenty), but there had evidently originally been\r\nforty-eight arranged in six rows of eight each.\r\n\r\nHe observed that they belonged to two different orders: the one resembled\r\nthe column in the Porch; the others, he says, have no capitals except\r\nthat upon one he perceived the half of a horse without its head.\r\nSingularly enough he falls into the same error as Gouvea, an error\r\nreproduced in some of the earlier engravings of the ruins; and represents\r\nthe columns as standing upon the same level as the Porch. According to\r\nour author, therefore, on leaving the Columnar Edifice he came to a ‘very\r\nbeautiful stair, which though not so large nor so high as the first, is\r\nincomparably more beautiful and magnificent, having on the walls and\r\nbalustrade a triumph or procession of men curiously clothed, carrying\r\nflags and banners and offerings. At one extremity of the procession we\r\nsee a chariot drawn by horses, in which there is an altar from whence\r\na flame of fire is seen to rise. At the other are combats of animals,\r\namong which he observed a lion tearing a bull, so well represented\r\nthat art can add nothing to its perfection: it is impossible indeed to\r\ndiscover the slightest defect.’ Having ascended the stairs, he reached\r\na court on which he observed a ruined building, consisting of several\r\nparts, each part about sixty feet long by twelve feet wide. This is the\r\nfirst distinct mention of what is now known as the Palace of Darius.\r\nThe walls are six or seven feet thick and twenty-four feet high, and\r\nare so profusely adorned with figures in relief that it would require\r\nseveral days to examine them adequately, and several months to describe\r\nthem in detail. The one that struck him most was the representation\r\nof a ‘venerable personage,’ sometimes seated ‘on an elevated bench,’\r\nsometimes walking, accompanied by two attendants holding a parasol and\r\na fly-chaser over his head. He was greatly impressed by the ‘perfection\r\nand vivacity’ of the figures; and ‘especially by the drapery and dress\r\nof the men.’ They are cut in ‘white marble and incorporated in the black\r\nstone,’ the latter being of such exquisite polish that it reflects\r\nas clearly as a mirror—so much so indeed that the Ambassador’s dog,\r\nRoldan, shrank back in terror from the reflection of his own ferocity.\r\nThis perfection of polish is the more remarkable, considering the great\r\nantiquity of the work, which must date from the monarchy of Assyria, or\r\neven earlier. He noted the strange peculiarity that among the immense\r\nnumber of figures there was not a single representation of a woman. He\r\nobserved inscriptions in some places, but ‘the characters,’ he said,\r\n‘are wholly unknown, and are no doubt more ancient than those of the\r\nHebrews, Chaldeans and Arabians, with which they have no relation; and\r\ntheir resemblance to those of the Greeks and Latins is still less.’ The\r\nruins of the Palace of Xerxes seem to have escaped his notice; but he\r\nvisited the Hall of the Hundred Columns. It covers, he says, a square\r\nof a hundred paces, the ground in the centre being thickly strewn with\r\nfallen columns. It looks more like an accumulation of several ruins than\r\nthe remains of a single edifice. Here also were bas-reliefs upon the\r\nwalls, larger than life and representing ‘furious combats with terrible\r\nand ferocious animals; some resembling winged lions and others serpents.’\r\n\r\nHe noticed the two famous sepulchres on the side of the mountain\r\noverhanging the ruins, above the space enclosed by the walls of the\r\nterrace. He observed that they were formed by a wall of black marble\r\nthirty feet square, covered with figures in white marble. On the top\r\nappears a man of authority, possibly a king or prince, seated on a\r\nthrone, with several figures standing round him. Before him is an altar\r\nwith fire burning upon it. Near it is a coffer cut into the rock, which\r\nseems to have been the sepulchre. It is seven or eight feet long by three\r\nfeet wide. The tombs are separated forty to fifty paces from each other\r\nbut are of similar design. It might, he thought, be at first supposed,\r\nas Gouvea seems to have imagined, that the splendid ruins below were\r\nintended only as an ‘ornament’ for the tomb of the Great King: but\r\nfurther reflection convinced the writer that they were none other than\r\nthe Palace and Citadel of the Persepolis described by ancient authors;\r\nand indeed there is distinct evidence of the conflagration due to the\r\nimpetuosity of Alexander.\r\n\r\nTill Don Garcia made the elaborate notes from which the writer of\r\nthe foregoing account derived his information, ‘nothing assured’ was\r\nknown in Europe concerning these remarkable remains. Sebastian Serlio,\r\nwe are told in his work on Architecture, only knew of them from ‘an\r\nuncertain and barbarous relation,’ and he has given us merely a rough\r\ndrawing of the edifice, showing forty small columns with Corinthian\r\ncapitals.[19] Don Garcia even complains that Gouvea could only give him\r\na ‘confused’ account. Don Garcia brought an artist with him, and he\r\ntook the best means of dissipating the obscurity in which the subject\r\nwas hitherto involved by having drawings made upon the spot. The artist\r\nsaid he intended to copy the triumphal procession on the stairs, but he\r\nprobably found the time at his disposal insufficient for this labour,\r\nfor he afterwards says he actually accomplished the drawing of four of\r\nthe figures, upon one of which were ‘the characters composed of little\r\ntriangles in the form of a pyramid.’ But of greater importance than these\r\nwas the copy Don Garcia ordered to be taken of ‘a whole line of the large\r\ninscription which is on the staircase in the centre of the triumphal\r\nprocession. It is to be found on a highly polished table, four feet\r\nin height, in which the letters are deeply cut.’ We are unable to say\r\nwhether these drawings appeared in the original Spanish edition, but they\r\nhave not been reproduced in the French translation.\r\n\r\nDon Garcia finally reached Ispahan in 1618, where he was detained till\r\nAugust in the following year. His mission turned out a complete failure.\r\nOne of its principal objects was to secure a monopoly of the Persian\r\ntrade for Spain. Just as he reached Goa he heard that the Governor of\r\nLara had taken Gombrun from the Portuguese. While he was in Persia, he\r\nhad the mortification to find that port regularly used every year by\r\nthe English to land their goods. In 1618, peace was concluded between\r\nPersia and Turkey, and the Shah was thus rendered independent of the\r\nSpanish alliance, while he was daily becoming more disposed to rely\r\nupon the English merchant fleet in the event of an open rupture with the\r\nPortuguese of Ormuz. He had always consistently opposed the concession\r\nof a monopoly to any one nation, and he now found himself sufficiently\r\npowerful to reject the demands of Spain. The discomfited Ambassador left\r\nin August 1619, and spent the winter at Ormuz in the hope of a favourable\r\nchange in the aspect of affairs: and he finally reached Spain in 1622,\r\nafter an adventurous voyage.\r\n\r\nDuring his residence in the Persian capital, he made the acquaintance\r\nof Pietro della Valle, a Roman gentleman of considerable fortune, who\r\nhad been travelling for some years in the East. In consequence of a\r\ndisappointment in love he had sought relief in foreign adventure, and at\r\nthe age of twenty-nine he embarked at Venice for Constantinople. After\r\nvisiting Egypt and the Holy Land, he crossed the desert to Bagdad. At\r\nthat time Bagdad was commonly supposed to be built on the site of the\r\nancient city of Babylon. But Della Valle had no difficulty in pointing\r\nout that this was evidently an error, for we know that the one city was\r\nbuilt on the Tigris, while the other stood on the Euphrates. He made\r\nseveral excursions through Mesopotamia, and visited the mounds near\r\nHillah, which he had no doubt covered the ruins of the true Babylon.\r\nHe has left an account of the state in which he found them, which may\r\nstill be read with interest; and he picked up some of the bricks, both\r\nbaked and unbaked, of which they are composed.[20] These he subsequently\r\nbrought back with him to Rome, where they were included in his private\r\ncollection of antiquities. They were perhaps the first specimens that\r\never reached Europe, and a few of them may still be seen in the Museo\r\nKircheriano. He indulged his antiquarian tastes by endeavouring to\r\nascertain the sites of some of the famous cities of antiquity, and he\r\nseems to have been the first to identify that of Ctesiphon correctly.\r\nAt Bagdad he married a Mesopotamian lady, and afterwards crossed the\r\nmountains of Kurdistan into Persia. He was cordially welcomed to the\r\nCourt by Shah Abbas, who enrolled him among the privileged number of\r\n‘Guests of the King.’\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1621, after a sojourn of nearly five years, Della Valle\r\nthought it expedient for many reasons to turn his steps homewards. He\r\nhad fallen into very bad health, and it was clear that he had ceased\r\nto be cordially received at Court, although he professes to have left\r\nwithout having forfeited its favour.[21] Accordingly on October 1, he\r\nquitted Ispahan without any formal leave-taking, and followed the usual\r\nroad to the coast. After several days’ journey he came to the Puli Neu,\r\nor New Bridge over the ‘Kur,’ no doubt the ‘Cyrus’ of the ancients,\r\nand probably also identical with the Araxes, a word that simply means\r\n‘river.’ He followed its course till he came to a small rivulet called\r\nthe Polvar, which at first he thought must correspond to the Medus\r\nof Strabo, an opinion he subsequently rejected on the ground that\r\nthe stream was not of sufficient importance. Having crossed it by a\r\nbridge, he at length reached Chehel Minar, and pitched his tents close\r\nto the ruins.[22] The ‘Geographical Epitome’ of Ferrari, which Della\r\nValle carried with him, represented Shiraz as the probable position of\r\nPersepolis, an opinion which Gouvea had not controverted. We have seen,\r\nhowever, that Don Garcia had no difficulty in identifying Chehel Minar\r\nwith the ruins of the ancient Persian Palace. Della Valle had no doubt\r\noften discussed the matter with him during the winter of 1618, which\r\nthey spent together at Ispahan, and he accepts the identification of\r\nthe site of Persepolis without hesitation. He was, however, by no means\r\nconvinced that the ruins upon the Terrace are the remains of the Palace.\r\nWithout decisively rejecting that supposition, he was more inclined to\r\nbelieve that they were originally designed for a great temple. The scene\r\non the sculptured staircase he regarded as a sacrificial procession; and\r\nthe imposing figure beneath the umbrella might represent a high priest\r\nno less than a king. He could not discover any indications that the\r\nprincipal buildings had ever been roofed, which he considered a strong\r\nconfirmation of the temple theory. He observed that the ‘horses’ on the\r\nPorch were human-headed with wings like griffins, and that their backs\r\nwere apparently protected by iron harness. He thought the monsters on the\r\nother two piers were the same, only facing in the opposite direction.\r\nBetween them he saw there had originally been four columns, two of which\r\nwere still standing, and the others fallen to the ground. Turning to\r\nthe right towards the south, he observed a large vase of marble, about\r\ntwenty-four feet square, that had evidently been intended for ablutions;\r\nand passing farther on in the same direction he came to the sculptured\r\nstaircase, which he now places for the first time in its correct position\r\nbeneath the Columnar Edifice. We also learn that the figures on both\r\nsides are turned towards the central stairs, and present the appearance\r\nof a procession about to ascend the steps. He gives a detailed account\r\nof the bas-reliefs, and observes that the different groups are separated\r\nfrom each other by a design representing the cypress tree. The various\r\nanimals that figure in the procession lead him to think they were\r\nintended for sacrifice, and hence that the edifice had been probably a\r\ntemple. He fixes the position of the inscriptions at the extreme end\r\nof the procession. He is much less enthusiastic in his praise than Don\r\nGarcia. He does not consider that the figures of men and animals, nor\r\nthose of trees, are well designed; and he thinks the beauty of the work\r\nas a whole consists chiefly in its antiquity and in the magnificence of\r\nthe marble of which it is composed. Don Garcia had counted twenty-seven\r\ncolumns, but at the time of Della Valle’s visit, only three and a half\r\nyears later, not more than twenty-five remained. As he approached from\r\nthe north he observed the traces of two rows of columns stretching from\r\neast to west. Beyond them is a vacant space, about sufficient for two\r\nrows of columns; and then we come to a central group of six rows of\r\ncolumns arranged from north to south. On either side, to west and east\r\nof the central group, but separated from it by the distance already\r\nmentioned, there are double rows of columns, as on the north side. He\r\nsays nothing of any colonnade on the south, where in fact there is none.\r\nThe columns are about twenty-six and a half feet apart, and some are\r\nhigher than others, from which he inferred that the building was not\r\nroofed, and could not therefore have been the palace of a king. He could\r\nnot find any trace of a staircase leading to an upper story.\r\n\r\nPassing the columns and continuing in the same southerly direction, he\r\nobserved two small chambers, one on the right hand, near the edge of the\r\nTerrace; the other on the left hand, towards the mountain. They are not\r\nreally chambers, but open courts; nor are they surrounded by walls, but\r\nby the jambs of doors and windows. As in the Columnar Edifice, there are\r\nno indications that the buildings were roofed, and on that account he\r\nbelieves they were parts of a temple where sacrifices were offered in\r\nthe open air; he does not consider they were designed for a sepulchre.\r\nIn addition to the ‘venerable personage’ already noted by Don Garcia, he\r\nremarked that men are depicted on the side doors struggling or fighting\r\nwith lions. Behind this chamber, in a small open court, he saw two high\r\npilasters with inscriptions at the top, but at such an elevation that he\r\ncould not distinguish the characters. From this point we fail to follow\r\nhim with equal certainty. He detected a group of columns forming a square\r\nof six in a ruin that evidently corresponds to the Palace of Xerxes;\r\nand he observed the remains of an aqueduct below. He alludes to another\r\nenclosure which may possibly be the Hall of the Hundred Columns, although\r\nhe thought it could have been no part of the original design of the\r\nfabric.\r\n\r\nHe remarked the great inscription near the lion on the wall of the\r\nsculptured terrace below the Columnar Edifice. ‘It occupies,’ he says,\r\n‘the entire height of the wall from top to bottom. One cannot tell in\r\nwhat language or letters these inscriptions are written, because the\r\ncharacters are unknown. They are very large and are not united to one\r\nanother, but divided and distinct, each by itself alone as in Hebrew:\r\nif indeed what I take for a letter only is not a complete word. I have\r\ncopied five of them as best I could, and they are those that occur most\r\nfrequently.’[23] The lines of the inscription are filled up ‘so that I\r\ncannot tell whether they are to be read from right to left as in Oriental\r\nlanguages, or from left to right as with us.’ He is, however, disposed to\r\nbelieve they are read from left to right, because when the ‘pyramidical\r\nfigure’ is vertical the head is always uppermost, and when the figure\r\nslopes or is placed horizontally the head is to the left and the point\r\ninclined to the right. He remarked that the writing was composed entirely\r\nof the one pyramidical figure and of an angular character more slender\r\nthan the other; and it was simply the number and disposition of these two\r\nforms that constituted the difference of the letter.\r\n\r\nDon Garcia had no doubt that the ruins had been entirely devoted to the\r\nsecular uses of a palace and citadel. We have seen that Della Valle,\r\nthough he accepted their identification with Persepolis, could not\r\nreadily believe that the large roofless buildings had ever been suited\r\nfor a dwelling, and he therefore inclined to the theory that they were\r\nthe remains of a temple.\r\n\r\nFrom his tent at Chehel Minar he rode a league to the north to the base\r\nof the hills that surround the plain, in order to visit a monument\r\ncalled Naksh-i-Rustam—of which he is the first to give an account. He\r\nexplains that Rustam is a celebrated Persian hero who lived about the\r\ntime of Cyrus. Della Valle came to a large square space levelled in the\r\nside of the rock, on which various figures larger than life were cut\r\nin half relief. The subject represented two men on horseback, the one\r\nendeavouring to wrest from the other a ring which he held in his hand.\r\nA third person appears on horseback, holding the hand of a man by his\r\nside. Elsewhere he observed figures of women, and other subjects to\r\nwhich he could not assign a meaning. Near these sculptures he noticed\r\nremains that could only have been intended for sepulchres. Among these\r\nwere two square pedestals with an aperture above to contain the ashes\r\nof the body. Elsewhere he observed on the side of the mountain several\r\nopenings like windows, possibly intended to admit a corpse. But the\r\nmost remarkable discovery was a sculpture that could only be reached\r\nby ladders. It represented the front of a house; a door in the centre\r\nand several columns on each side, supporting an architrave—frieze and\r\ncornice. The front was ornamented with various figures which he could\r\nnot accurately define on account of the height of the monument. But he\r\nthought he discerned a man leaning upon a bow and contemplating an altar.\r\nAbove him, as if suspended in the air, was a figure which appeared to his\r\ncompanions to resemble the Devil. He thought this was probably Jamshid,\r\nwho had reigned many years before Cyrus, and who is still remembered as\r\na great enchanter, and possibly to be identified with Nebuchadnezzar. He\r\nhad seen two somewhat similar sepulchres just over Chehel Minar (those\r\nnoticed by Don Garcia), and one of these he had been able to enter. He\r\nfound they were excavated from the rock, quadrilateral in shape, and\r\nabout the height of a man; with three large hollow niches at the sides,\r\nwhich he somewhat fancifully imagined had been used as reservoirs for\r\nwater. A long stone he observed on the floor appeared to cover the place\r\nof sepulture. He thought the city of Persepolis might have covered the\r\nwhole plain between Chehel Minar and Naksh-i-Rustam.\r\n\r\nDella Valle only passed two days among these ruins, and then continued\r\nhis journey to Shiraz. His intention was to go to Ormuz and take a\r\npassage to Goa, from whence he could find his way back to Europe. As\r\nhe approached the coast, however, he found his journey impeded from a\r\nvery unexpected cause. The departure of Don Garcia from Ispahan, in\r\nthe summer of 1619, had been followed by the interruption of the good\r\nrelations between the Portuguese and the Persians. While the Ambassador\r\nwas still detained at Ormuz (1619-20) he had the mortification to\r\nwitness the English merchant fleet arrive and calmly proceed to take\r\nthe soundings of the harbour of Gombrun, which, since its annexation to\r\nPersia, had acquired the new name of Bunder Abbas, or Port of Abbas. In\r\nthe spring (1620), hostilities broke out between Persia and the Arabs of\r\nthe opposite coast, who were friendly to the Portuguese. With a view to\r\nreprisals the latter threw the Persian merchants at Ormuz into prison.\r\nAs the year advanced, the Portuguese fleet arrived with positive orders\r\nto recover Gombrun and the island of Bahrein, and also to build a fort\r\nat Kesem to secure the water supply. The friction that existed between\r\nthe Portuguese and Spanish authorities delayed the immediate execution of\r\nthese instructions, and meanwhile the annual English fleet had time to\r\narrive. An engagement at once followed, and the Portuguese were forced\r\nto withdraw (January 1621). When the English vessels left the Gulf with\r\ntheir cargo the Portuguese returned, and speedily began hostilities by\r\nlanding a force on the island of Kesem and beginning the erection of\r\na fort (June 1621). In the autumn they destroyed the Port of the Two\r\nHeadlands on the mainland, and the Persian army immediately occupied the\r\nwhole coast line and cut off communications with Ormuz (October). This\r\nevent occurred just at the time Della Valle was on his journey to Bunder\r\nAbbas. He approached sufficiently near to hear the roar of cannon from\r\nOrmuz, and after making some useless attempts to cross to the island, he\r\nretired to Mina, where, under the protection of the English merchants, he\r\nwaited the course of events (October 1621). The town was very unhealthy.\r\nHis wife died, and he himself was reduced to the point of death. As\r\nsoon as the English fleet arrived the Persians with their assistance\r\ncommenced hostilities in earnest. Kesem was occupied and the new fort\r\ndestroyed. Ormuz itself was attacked, and fell after an heroic resistance\r\n(April 1622). The Portuguese held the port of Jask on the mainland till\r\nthe following year (1623), when it was taken by the English to avenge\r\nthe death of their commander Shilling, and handed over to the Persians.\r\nThus the Portuguese were finally driven from the Persian Gulf, and their\r\ntrade was transferred to the English and Dutch.[24] Della Valle returned\r\nto Shiraz to recruit his health, and it was not till January 1623 that\r\nhe found a passage in an English vessel to Surat. He reached Rome in\r\n1626, bringing with him the body of his wife, and a large collection\r\nof curiosities. He gave an account of his adventures in a series of\r\nletters to a friend at Naples: the one which contains his description of\r\nPersepolis is dated from Shiraz, October 21, 1621. On his return to Rome\r\nhe made a collection of his scattered correspondence, but the first part\r\ndid not appear till 1650, only two years before his death; the portion\r\n(Part III.) that contains the letter on Persepolis was first published in\r\n1658. It included the five cuneiform letters he had copied on the spot,\r\nand although their publication was delayed for nearly forty years they\r\nstill seem to have been the first to appear in Europe; for we are not\r\naware that the drawings of Don Garcia ever saw the light.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Persepolis was visited by an English traveller, whose\r\ndescription long anticipated that of Della Valle. It will be recollected\r\nthat Gouvea met a young Englishman, Robert Shirley, at Ispahan in\r\n1602, and won him over to the Catholic faith. Shirley was subsequently\r\nemployed by Shah Abbas as Envoy to the European Courts, and he resided\r\nfor many years in Spain. The fall of Ormuz put an end to his mission\r\nin that country, and in 1623 we find him in England. He was a somewhat\r\nabsurd person who adhered to Oriental costume, and went about in a red\r\nturban surmounted by a cross. A singular occurrence cast suspicion on\r\nthe validity of his credentials as a Persian envoy. A native Persian\r\narrived on the scene, who treated Shirley’s pretensions with contempt,\r\nand gave himself out as the only true representative of the Shah. The\r\ndocuments that could alone settle the dispute were all written in\r\nPersian, and no independent person could then be found in the whole of\r\nEngland who was able to read a word of that language. The controversy\r\ngrew warm, and the native Persian enforced his position by knocking his\r\nrival down. At length it was determined to send an English ambassador to\r\nIspahan to clear up the matter, and Sir Dormer Cotton was selected. He\r\nwas accompanied by Sir Thomas Herbert, who has left an account of his\r\nadventures. They sailed from Tilbury on Good Friday 1626 and reached\r\nBunder Abbas in January 1627. He found the English in enjoyment of\r\nhigh favour in consequence of the assistance they had lately rendered\r\nin driving the Portuguese from the Gulf. They were ‘privileged to wear\r\ntheir flags displayed at the top of their publick houses’ or consulates,\r\nand there were many merchants, both English and Dutch, living in the\r\ntown. Nor does it appear to have been a wholly undesirable residence.\r\nHerbert speaks in praise of the ‘Buzaar,’ the numerous coffee-houses,\r\nsherbet-shops, and other places of entertainment. Its prosperity had\r\nincreased immensely since the fall of Ormuz, ‘which of late was the glory\r\nof the East, but had now become the most disconsolate.’\r\n\r\nThe description Herbert gives of Persepolis in the first two editions\r\nof his Travels, which appeared in 1634 and 1638, is extremely meagre\r\nand imperfect.[25] He says it was built by ‘Sosarinus, who lived in\r\nthe Median dynasty, the third Emperor from Arbaces, who gave end to\r\nSardanapalus.’[26] It flourished for two hundred and thirty years till\r\ndestroyed by Alexander. He does not believe that Shiraz was ever a part\r\nof Persepolis, thirty miles distant, though the one may have risen out\r\nof the other. He remarks that the ‘whole basis’ or platform ‘is cut\r\nby incredible toyle out of the solid marble rock twice the compasse\r\nof Wyndsor Castle.’ It is approached by ‘ninety-five easie staires,\r\ndissected from the durable black marble,’ ‘so broad that a dozen\r\nhorsemen may ride up abreast together.’ The total ascent, however, is\r\nnot more than twenty-two feet, and at the summit is a gate ‘engraven\r\nwith a mightie elephant on one side and a Rhynoceros on the other.’\r\nThese majestic figures are thirty feet high; and a little beyond are two\r\nother piers ‘wherein is engraven a Pegasus.’ Between them he noticed two\r\ncolumns, and was consequently more accurate than Don Garcia. ‘Of like\r\nwork, bulk and matter are two gallant Towers.’ The gate leads to the\r\nfamous Columns, of which only nineteen now remain standing, and one other\r\nbelow in the plain. ‘Howbeit the ruines and ground of four score more are\r\nyet visible: this great roome was the Hall.’ He at first estimated the\r\nheight of the columns at ‘fifteen foote,’ but later (1638) he modified\r\nthis to from fifteen to twenty cubits. And they ‘rise beautifully in\r\nforty squares or concave parallels; every square has three full inches.’\r\n‘Adjoining is another square roome whose blacke marble wals are yet\r\nabiding.’ It has eight doors ‘exquisitely engraven with images of Lions,\r\nTygres, Griffons and Buls of rare sculpture and perfection: a top of\r\neach door is the image of an Emperour in state with staffe and scepter.’\r\nElsewhere he amplifies this account. ‘In other places (for the wals\r\nare durable) Battailes, Hecatombs, triumphs, Olympick games, and the\r\nlike, in very rare sculpture and proportion.’ The country people gave\r\ndifferent accounts as to whom this figure was intended to represent, and\r\nthey variously proposed Jamsheat, Aaron, Sampson and Solomon, but they\r\nexcluded Rustam. This room measured ‘ninety paces from angle to angle, in\r\ncircuit three hundred and sixty paces, beautified with eight dores,’ and\r\njoining it were two smaller apartments, one seventy by sixty, the other\r\nthirty by twenty paces. He was told that the first was the Chamber of\r\nthe Queen and the other the nursery. He was particularly struck by the\r\nappearance of the latter. ‘The wals are,’ he says, ‘rarely engraven with\r\nimages of huge stature, and have been illustrated with gold which in some\r\nplaces is visible, the stones in many parts so well polisht that they\r\nequal for brightnesse a steele mirrour.’ He was at a loss to assign this\r\nwonderful building to any of the known styles of architecture: ‘whether\r\nthis Fabrick was Ionick Dorick or Corinthiack I cannot determine, but\r\nsuch to this day it is that a ready Lymmer in three moneths space can\r\nhardly (to do it well) depict out all her excellencies.’\r\n\r\nHe also noticed the tomb mentioned by Don Garcia. It lies, he says,\r\n‘somewhat further, over heaps of stones of valewable portraictures.’ ‘It\r\nis cut out of the perpendicular mountaine,’ and represents ‘the image\r\nof a King (which may be Cambyses) adoring three deities, the fire, the\r\nsunne and a serpent.’ He also mentions ‘Nasci Rustam,’ the monument of\r\nRustam, situated, he says, five miles west of Persepolis.[27]\r\n\r\nHerbert gives an engraving of the ruins, which is the first general view\r\never taken of Persepolis in modern times. It only occupies a portion of\r\na small folio page, and it is scarcely possible to imagine any drawing\r\nmore inaccurate and grotesque. We ascend to the platform by a series of\r\nabout fourteen steps leaning straight up against it, at right angles to\r\nthe line of the terrace. At the summit there is not a trace of the Porch,\r\nbut we pass through a narrow opening with posts on either side. On the\r\ntop of one of these appears an elephant with its proboscis stretched\r\nout in a menacing attitude. On the top of the other post we observe an\r\nunpleasant creature leaning forward, possibly intended for a tiger. When\r\nwe have made our way through these inhospitable guardians and gained\r\nthe platform, we find the whole of it on the left-hand side occupied by\r\ncolumns. Facing the entrance, at some distance from it, we see three\r\ndoors and the high wall of a roofless building, and behind it a lofty and\r\nragged mountain. Behind the columns on the left at a great elevation we\r\nobserve a kneeling figure, worshipping a serpent coiling round a cross,\r\nand beyond, an altar on which fire is burning. To the right, on the same\r\nlevel, we observe a human-headed centipede. This misleading picture is\r\nreproduced evidently from the same plate in the second edition of 1638.\r\nIt was not till the appearance of the second edition that he thought it\r\nworth while to notice the existence of the cuneiform letters. ‘In part of\r\nthis great roome,’ he says, referring to the Palace of Darius ‘(not farre\r\nfrom the portall) in a mirrour of polisht marble wee noted above a dozen\r\nlynes of strange characters, very faire and apparent to the eye, but\r\nso mysticall, so odly framed as no Hieroglyphick no other deep conceit\r\ncan be more difficultly fancied, more adverse to the intellect. These\r\nconsisting of figures, obelisk, triangular and pyramidall yet in such\r\nsimmetry and order as cannot well be called barbarous. Some resemblance,\r\nI thought some words had of the Antick Greek shadowing out Ahashuerus\r\nTheos. And though it have small concordance with the Hebrew, Greek and\r\nLatine letter, yet questionlesse to the Inventer it was well knowne and\r\nperadventure may conceale some excellent matter though to this day wrapt\r\nup in the dim leafes of envious obscuritie.’[28]\r\n\r\nThe letter of Don Garcia had appeared in Purchas the year before Herbert\r\nsailed for India, and it is obvious he had it before him when he wrote\r\nhis own account. Indeed he refers to Don Garcia, though he does not\r\nacknowledge his own obligations to him. Don Garcia in his letter did not\r\nmention the sculptured stairs, one of the most remarkable features of the\r\nruin; Herbert has likewise passed it over in silence. Don Garcia remarked\r\nthat it was possible to ride up the stairs to the platform. Herbert\r\nadds that twelve horsemen might ride abreast; forty years later he\r\nrecollected that he had actually witnessed this feat accomplished. Both\r\nwriters express doubts in nearly the same language as to the style of the\r\narchitecture; they both compare the cuneiform letters to ‘pyramids’ and\r\n‘obelisks,’ and they both note their dissimilarity to Hebrew, Greek and\r\nLatin. Herbert had, however, the merit of giving the earliest published\r\naccount of the Palace of Darius.[29] His description of the animals on\r\nthe gate and his measurements are also wholly his own.\r\n\r\nHaving spent two days at Persepolis, he followed the mission to Asheraff,\r\non the Caspian, where Shah Abbas was holding his Court. The result was\r\nextremely disappointing. The Shah indeed received Sir Dormer Cotton with\r\nhis usual courtesy, and declared his continued friendship for Sir Robert\r\nShirley. He acknowledged the services Shirley had rendered, and protested\r\nhis willingness to punish his traducer, if that miscreant had not\r\nunfortunately escaped his vengeance by death. But the Shah was then an\r\nold man, and he appears to have fallen under the influence of a favourite\r\nMinister. This functionary interposed so successfully that the Ambassador\r\ncould never obtain a second interview, and, after considerable delay,\r\nthe courtier assured him that he had the royal authority to declare that\r\nthe credentials of Sir Robert Shirley were fictitious. This startling\r\ncommunication was certainly false, and no doubt it originated with the\r\nMinister himself; but it was no less decisive of the matter. Overcome by\r\ndisappointment, both Sir Dormer and Shirley fell ill and died shortly\r\nafterwards. Herbert continued his journey, and after visiting Babylon,\r\nreturned to Surat, on his way home.\r\n\r\nThe account he gave of the ruins to his friends excited considerable\r\ninterest, which was stimulated by the publication of two editions of\r\nhis Travels. He often expressed his regret that adequate drawings were\r\nnot made by a competent artist before the monument was irrevocably\r\ndestroyed: ‘The barbarous people every day defacing it and cleaving\r\nit asunder for grave stones and benches to sit upon.’ The result of\r\nthese representations was that Lord Arundel sent out a young artist\r\nfor the express purpose, who unfortunately died before he reached his\r\ndestination. It seems indeed that the ruins were for a time really\r\nexposed to considerable danger. In consequence of the writings of Della\r\nValle and Herbert, they were visited by so many foreigners of distinction\r\nthat the Governors of Shiraz found their revenues seriously taxed by\r\nthe obligations of hospitality. Several, it was said, were ruined, and\r\nat length one of the Governors made a deliberate attempt to destroy the\r\ncause of so much inconvenience. But the solidity of the structure offered\r\nserious obstacles to the execution of this design.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Persia was beginning to attract more general attention, and in\r\n1637 it was visited by a German named Oelschloeger, more euphemistically\r\nstyled Olearus. His ‘Beschreibung’ was first published at Schleswig in\r\n1647, and a revised edition appeared in 1656.[30] It is a magnificent\r\nfolio in black-letter, richly adorned with a profusion of excellent\r\nengravings and a number of maps. The book was translated into Dutch in\r\n1651, into French in 1656, and into English in 1666. Olearus was born\r\nin Anhalt in the first year of the century, and entered the service of\r\nthe Duke of Holstein-Gottorp. The Duke had recently founded the town\r\nof Friederichstadt, and he desired to open a trade with Persia by way\r\nof Russia. He accordingly sent a commission to Moscow and Persia to\r\nnegotiate the business, and Olearus was attached to it as secretary.[31]\r\nThey left Gottrop in October 1635, but it was not till the end of\r\nMarch 1636 that they even reached Moscow. They continued their journey\r\nin the end of May, and arrived at Ispahan in April of the following\r\nyear (1637). Shah Abbas had died in 1629, but they were well received\r\nby his successor, Shah Sefy, and the usual interchange of presents\r\nfollowed. One of the Ambassadors, a merchant named Brugman, displayed\r\nvery undiplomatic conduct, and the embassy failed in its purpose. It\r\naccomplished the return journey somewhat more rapidly, in about a year\r\nand a half (December 21, 1637, to August 1, 1639). Olearus did not visit\r\nPersepolis himself, but a member of the mission, the ‘hochedel gebornen’\r\nMandelslo, proceeded to India by the well-known route to Ormuz and passed\r\nthe ruins. Olearus devoted himself to Persian studies, and translated\r\n‘Gulistan.’ But his chief service is the excellent edition he published\r\nof the travels of Mandelslo, which he enriched by copious notes of his\r\nown taken from various sources.[32] We learn from this work that, on his\r\nway from Ispahan to the coast, in 1638, Mandelslo came to a large village\r\ncalled Meshid Maderre Soliman, which, he said, derived its name from a\r\ntomb half a mile distant. It was explained to him by the Carmelites of\r\nShiraz that no doubt it was the resting place of the mother of the great\r\nShah Solimans, though the popular opinion in the neighbourhood was that\r\nit was the tomb of Solomon himself. He gives an excellent description\r\nof the chapel of white marble resting upon successive tiers of square\r\nblocks of hewn stone; and adds that in his day there might still be seen\r\nwithin the chapel strange letters in unknown characters engraved upon\r\nthe walls. These, however, were afterwards ascertained to be merely\r\nverses from the Koran, written in Arabic. He has given a drawing of it,\r\nwhich conveys a fair impression of its appearance, and is curious as the\r\nearliest known representation of the tomb of Cyrus. Continuing to the\r\nsouth, he reached Persepolis. He heard many fabulous accounts of its\r\norigin, some ascribing it to Tzemschied Padschach, others to Solomon,\r\nand some even to Darius; but his informants were clear that it had\r\nbeen destroyed by ‘Iskander as they call Alexander.’ The ascent is made\r\nby four stairs with ninety-five marble steps. On reaching the summit\r\nhe found the remains of four walls, apparently designed for gates. On\r\nthe two first were horses carved in stone, with curious head-stalls and\r\nsaddles. On the other two the horses have lion heads and are adorned with\r\ncrowns and wings. He also, like Herbert, entirely omits to mention the\r\nsculptured stairs, and passes direct from the gates to the describe the\r\ncolumns. He found nineteen standing, and eleven others partly ruined,\r\nbut no doubt the original number was forty. He could not decide whether\r\nthe building had been roofed. Passing on, a slight ascent brought him to\r\ntwo moderate-sized chambers, of which the door and window posts remained\r\nas well as the walls, the latter remarkable for their beautiful shining\r\nmarble. On the sides of the doors he observed figures larger than life,\r\nsome sitting and others standing. They wore long beards and their hair\r\ndescended to the shoulder, while their robes extended to the feet. Not\r\nfar distant are other chambers, but of these nothing remains except the\r\ndoor and window frames. ‘Not far from these rooms,’ he continues, ‘is a\r\nsquare column in which is a polished stone, some say of jasper, in which\r\nare engraved singular characters or writing, which no one can read. They\r\nseem as if they had been inlaid with gold.’ The rest of the platform is\r\nbeautiful and level, and measures about 300 by 200 paces. Mandelslo has\r\nillustrated his description by an engraving that scarcely does justice\r\nto the text. After the statement that the platform was reached by four\r\nstairs, we were not prepared to find in the illustration a single row of\r\nsteps leading straight up at right angles. The translator, Davies, seems\r\nto have thought that by the four stairs were meant a single flight at\r\neach corner of the platform. The four ‘walls’ of the Porch appear as a\r\nseries of detached stones placed in a row, one after the other, along\r\nthe western line of the terrace. The animals are cut out of the front\r\nof each stone, but they have no appearance of supporting any portion of\r\nthe structure. Beyond, at some distance to the east, is a small square\r\nbuilding, having on one side the slab with the inscription. There is no\r\nindication whatever of the sculptured terrace, which is indeed wholly\r\nforgotten in the text. The columns, however, at length appear for the\r\nfirst time in the true direction to the right of the entrance. From\r\nthem an immense wall extends right across the platform to the east. It\r\nis pierced below by one large and three other smaller doors. Above,\r\napparently belonging to a second story, are a series of seven or eight\r\ndouble windows, while still higher we observe several figures of men and\r\nanimals. This great structure obscures the view of the tombs on the hill,\r\nand they are not mentioned in the text. Olearus, in his notes, refers to\r\nBarbaro, and, at second hand, to Don Garcia. But his chief reference is\r\nto Herbert, from whom he quotes the whole of the account given in the\r\nearlier editions of the Travels.\r\n\r\nMandelslo’s book was translated into English by John Davies, and it\r\nappeared in 1662, four years after its original publication; but the\r\nillustrations were not reproduced.[33] The translator has adopted the\r\nvery singular method of incorporating with the text the notes that\r\nOlearus added from other writers. Mandelslo is thus made to appear as\r\nif he had quietly appropriated without acknowledgment the observations\r\nmade by Barbaro, Don Garcia, and Herbert. The translator is, however,\r\nwholly responsible for this peculiar result. At the time Olearus issued\r\nhis edition (1658) the text, taken together with the notes, probably\r\nresumed all that was then known concerning Persepolis and the cuneiform\r\nletters; and the translator made no independent additions.[34] But in the\r\nsame year (1658) the third volume of Della Valle’s Travels was at length\r\npublished, in which he gives the account of his visit to the ruins. His\r\nfame soon became well known in England, and a translation of his Travels\r\nto India appeared in 1665, along with those of Sir Thomas Roe.\r\n\r\nNearly thirty years had now elapsed since the last edition of Sir Thomas\r\nHerbert’s book was published (1638). He was still living, and no doubt\r\nhe became sensible of the deficiency of his own account of Persepolis in\r\ncomparison with that of Della Valle. It appears also that a Mr. Skinner\r\nhad recently returned from Persia, with whom Herbert had the advantage\r\nof conversing. He had, moreover, preserved ‘the mixt notes’ he took at\r\nthe time of his visit, nearly forty years before, and with a memory thus\r\nrefreshed he sat down to compose a greatly enlarged account of the famous\r\nruins.[35] He also gave instructions to the engraver Holler to execute\r\nan entirely new design of the place, which was accomplished in 1663. The\r\nview is still characterised by the most surprising inaccuracy. It is\r\nupon a much larger scale, and is a far more pretentious work than its\r\npredecessor. We now ascend to the platform by a double staircase parallel\r\nto the line of the terrace, but it is still erroneously represented\r\nprojecting prominently from beyond it. At the summit we observe the four\r\nanimals and the two columns of the Porch. There is, however, no trace of\r\nthe walls the animals supported. In front are an elephant on one side\r\nand a rhinoceros on the other, having ‘visages with beards and long hair\r\nlike men, agreeable to that fourth beast which Daniel looked upon.’ One\r\nof the other animals is ‘like unto a Pegasus,’ ‘trapped with warlike\r\nmail’; but the fourth ‘is so disfigured that it cannot be described.’\r\nTurning to the right, we see at the edge of the terrace a tombstone of\r\nthe usual pattern, engraved apparently with cuneiform letters. It stands\r\nentirely by itself, and is no doubt the jasper or marble table referred\r\nto in the text. Beyond it, upon the same level, are a large number of\r\ncolumns and the ruins of many others are to be seen strewn upon the\r\nground. He tells us ‘there be but 19 pillars at this day extant, yet\r\nthe fractures and bases of 21 more are perspicable.’ ‘It is evident,’\r\nhowever, he continues, ‘there were in all a hundred pillars when the\r\nplace was in perfection, as appears by the vacant spaces and also bases\r\n... which are yet visible.’ The entire centre of the picture is occupied\r\nby a raised platform, no less than thirty feet above the level of the\r\nporch and columns. It is approached by a double staircase constructed in\r\nprecisely the same manner as the first. The north wall of this elevated\r\nterrace stretches across, west to east, from the columns below to the\r\nhill that bounds the platform on the east, and it is completely covered\r\nfrom end to end with bas-reliefs. This sculptured wall was entirely\r\nforgotten by Herbert in his earlier editions, and it is now described\r\nelaborately, the description being evidently borrowed from Della Valle,\r\na few errors being introduced, possibly from the ‘mixt notes.’ Having\r\nascended to this elevated terrace, we come to a huge two-storied\r\nbuilding, open at the top, resembling a modern factory gutted by a fire.\r\nIt is divided into three compartments, and is represented as occupying\r\nthe whole western side of the platform. Both within and without, from top\r\nto bottom, we observe the walls are entirely covered with bas-reliefs.\r\nOn turning to the text for an explanation, we find, however, that the\r\nbuilding still possesses its former modest dimensions; but ‘the walls\r\nand broken arches were wrought or pourtrayed with figures resembling\r\nsome great persons on horseback, after whom proceed several others in\r\nsacerdotal habits.’ He has still a clear recollection of the ‘gold that\r\nwas laid upon the Freez and Cornish, as also upon the trim of Vests.’\r\nTurning away from this wonderful building, we observe a small ruin in\r\nthe north-east corner, standing like the one just described upon the\r\nupper platform. This corresponds in position to that occupied by the\r\nHall of the Hundred Columns, and the description he gives of it is one\r\nof the most singular portions of his narrative. He came, he says, to a\r\nlarge square room, where he observed bas-reliefs of a great person, and\r\n‘sundry petitioners, but in several habits, as men of several nations,’\r\nbesides guards armed with spears. Near this he penetrated into a vault,\r\n‘flagged at the bottome with square marble stones,’ which led him into a\r\n‘fair room or chappel,’ ‘supported by four pillars 4 yards about, 8 in\r\nheighth and 4 yards from each other.’ He found the entrance elaborately\r\nsculptured with the figures of men, apparently priests, with uplifted\r\nhands. By another subterranean passage he reached a second chapel, also\r\nsupported by four pillars seven yards high. Upon the arch is a man of\r\ncolossal size with a lion couchant at his feet. Near him a king seated\r\non a chair of state and on either side two rows of flamens. A few paces\r\nthence he beheld two giants, who by pure force subjugate two lions, and\r\nnot far off a great prince, holding a sceptre or Pastoral Staff. On one\r\nside of him stand the Satraps, and on the other the Magi or priests.\r\nOpposite is a prisoner in chains, who he conjectures may be Daniel or\r\nCroesus. Beneath are six ranks of guards carrying spikes. Such is the\r\nfirst detailed account we have of the Hall of the Hundred Columns, and\r\nthe elaborate sculptures with which it is adorned. It is remarkable\r\nthat the accumulation of rubbish should have been so great that Herbert\r\nsays ‘’tis presumed that the greatest part of the pile was vaulted\r\nunderground’; and that, according as he burrowed laboriously through\r\nthe _débris_, each of its great doors should appear to him like vaulted\r\nchapels.[36]\r\n\r\nThe hill that overhangs the platform on the south-east is shown by the\r\ndrawing to be covered by a wonderful work of art. Four rows of figures\r\nsupport a stage whereon we observe a kneeling figure; but the serpent is\r\nnow seen grovelling upon the ground, and the centipede of the earlier\r\nedition has developed into ‘a demon of as uncouth and ugly a shape as\r\nwell could be imagined.’ ‘It is of a gigantic size ... discovering a\r\nmost dreadful visage twixt man and beast. This monster has seven several\r\narms.’ He now treats us to three lines of inscriptions ‘for better\r\ndemonstration, which nevertheless whiles they cannot be read, will in\r\nall probability like the Mene Tekel without the help of a Daniel hardly\r\nbe interpreted.’ He agrees with Della Valle that each character might\r\nrepresent a word—or at least a syllable. He also agrees with the same\r\nauthority that the writing ran from left to right, but in the sample\r\nhe gives us, two or three characters are placed upside down which, if\r\nthey had fallen under Della Valle’s notice in that position would have\r\nentirely upset his argument from their ‘posture and tendency.’ Herbert\r\ncompared the characters with ‘twelve several alphabets in Postellus\r\nand with the fifty-eight alphabets which Purchas had borrowed from the\r\nlearned Gromex,’ but he could not perceive the least resemblance. They\r\nare, he says, ‘like Pyramids inverted, or with bases upwards, or like\r\nTriangles or Deltas.’ He, however, recommends the study to ‘ingenious\r\npersons who delight themselves in this dark and difficult art or exercise\r\nof Deciphering.’ The language must have been known to Daniel, who was\r\nprobably the architect of this palace as of ‘Shushan and Ecbatan’; for\r\nwe know that he was a ‘civil officer’ under ‘Nebuchadnezzar, Belshazzar,\r\nAstyages, Darius and Cyrus.’\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of the century we are chiefly indebted to French\r\ntravellers for the gradual accumulation of more correct information upon\r\nthis subject, and it was greatly to their advantage that they could\r\nalways depend upon a hospitable welcome and much store of information\r\nfrom the friendly Superior of the Capuchins at Ispahan. When Persia\r\nwas first rendered accessible to Europeans by the liberal policy of\r\nShah Abbas, numerous missionaries flocked to the capital in the hope\r\nof winning converts to the Roman faith. We have already seen that the\r\nAugustinian Friars who arrived with Gouvea were awarded a disused palace\r\nas a monastery. They were followed, in 1608, by Carmelites from Rome.\r\nIn 1627, Father Pacifique, of the French Order of Capuchins, obtained\r\npermission to establish missions at Ispahan and Bagdad; and during the\r\nsecond half of the seventeenth century their house became a resort of\r\nthe principal European travellers. The rule of Père Raphael du Mans\r\ncovered the whole of that period. He is first heard of at Ispahan, in\r\n1644, where he remained as Superior of the Order till his death, in\r\n1696, at the age of eighty-three. Not long after the settlement of the\r\nCapuchins, the Jesuits also made a similar attempt, but without much\r\nsuccess; they were, however, given permission to open schools at Tauriz\r\nand a few other places in the south of Persia. It must be recollected\r\nthat the object of these religious persons was not so much the conversion\r\nof Mahomedans—an attempt which when discovered was always rigorously\r\npunished—as the extension of the Roman sway over the Georgian and other\r\nnative Christians. Resident agents of the Dutch and English East India\r\nCompanies had also long been settled in the country. The Shah presented\r\nthem with handsome residences at Ispahan and Shiraz; and they had\r\npermanent establishments at Bunder Abbas. The French still remained\r\nat a great disadvantage. Their first East India Company was formed in\r\n1604, but for more than thirty years it did not fit out a single ship.\r\nAt length its term of privilege expired without its ever having been\r\nexercised (1635), and a merchant of Dieppe despatched a vessel on his own\r\naccount. A small Company was eventually formed and an attempt made to\r\nfound a trading colony at Madagascar in imitation of those possessed by\r\nthe English and Dutch at Bombay and Ceylon (1643); but no result followed\r\nand its privileges likewise lapsed. In 1664 another effort was made, and\r\nthree agents were sent to Persia to reside at Ispahan, Shiraz, and Bunder\r\nAbbas, while two envoys were accredited to the Court. These efforts were,\r\nhowever, productive of little result, and were chiefly felt by the enmity\r\nthey excited among the Dutch against the eminent French travellers who\r\nare now to engage our attention.\r\n\r\nThe names of Tavernier, Daulier Deslandes and Thévenot fill the latter\r\nhalf of the seventeenth century. Tavernier enjoyed an exceptional\r\nreputation as a traveller and merchant throughout the whole of that\r\nperiod. He was born at Paris, in 1605, of a Protestant family, and began\r\nhis wanderings at the early age of fifteen. At first he followed the\r\nprofession of a soldier of fortune, but he soon exchanged that precarious\r\ncalling for the more lucrative pursuit of a travelling jeweller. He\r\nvisited the East altogether six times between the years 1632 and 1668.\r\nHis chief dealings were with the Shah of Persia, but he also extended\r\nhis travels to India, and he was the first Frenchman to visit the Court\r\nof the Great Mogul. He brought back jewels from the mines of Golconda\r\nand from the pearl fisheries of the Persian Gulf, and after having them\r\npolished and set in Paris, he sold them at greatly enhanced prices to\r\nIndian princes and to the Shah of Persia. He was the first to reveal the\r\nriches of the East to his countrymen, and he enjoyed the favour of Louis\r\nXIV., from whom he received a patent of nobility. It was on the occasion\r\nof his sixth and last journey to Persia, in 1664, that he was accompanied\r\nby Daulier Deslandes, a young artist who was included among his eight\r\n‘serviteurs,’ and who passed the year with him.[37] Although travelling\r\ntogether in this manner for the sake of convenience, Daulier was in\r\nfact charged with a special mission on behalf of the French merchant\r\ncompany.[38] The two travellers left Ispahan in 1665 on their way to\r\nBunder Abbas, and they seem on that occasion to have visited Persepolis\r\ntogether. Some days later they overtook M. de Thévenot at Bihry, in\r\nLars (March 26) and the whole party proceeded to the coast. Tavernier\r\nwent on to India, but Daulier and Thévenot returned to Persepolis (May\r\n1665), and it was probably during this second visit that Daulier found\r\ntime to make his investigations.[39] He published the account of his\r\ntravels in 1673, and among the illustrations that adorn his book there is\r\none of Persepolis or, as it is called, Tchelminar.[40] The engraving is\r\nvastly superior to anything that had yet appeared: indeed the fanciful\r\nand erroneous pictures given by Herbert and Mandelslo do not deserve\r\nto be put in comparison with it. We now for the first time obtain some\r\nidea of the real appearance of the ruins. The view is taken from the\r\nwest, and shows correctly the peculiar features of the stairs, sunk into\r\nthe wall of the terrace, and ascending in double flights parallel to\r\nit. We observe also the remarkable indentations in the formation of the\r\nplatform, which Della Valle thought were designed for its defence. The\r\nfour walls of the Porch, separated by the two columns, are intelligibly\r\ndrawn, though their height is inadequate and the animals do not stand\r\nout with sufficient boldness. The fourfold ascent by single flights to\r\nthe upper platform is clearly shown; and for the first time we find\r\nthe Columnar Edifice of Xerxes correctly placed above. The still more\r\nelevated position of the Palace of Darius is plainly marked and its\r\nruins fairly represented. The absurd appearance it presented in the\r\ndrawings of Herbert and Mandelslo now finally disappears, and we obtain\r\nsomething like a correct view of the southern portion of the platform.\r\nBeyond the door and window frames of the Palace of Darius we observe\r\nto the south-east the ruins of the somewhat similar edifice of Xerxes.\r\nThe latter is depicted upon a much higher elevation, and the western\r\nstaircase leading to it comes too prominently into view. The east side\r\nof the platform is still indistinct. The Central Edifice and the Hall of\r\nthe Hundred Columns are somewhat confused: the latter edifice appears\r\nerroneously placed upon the central platform. No adequate representation\r\nof the Tombs upon the hill is attempted. The description that accompanies\r\nthe plate evinces much accurate observation. He treats the platform as\r\ndivided into three different elevations, and in many places he observed\r\nthat the rock itself was the foundation of the edifice. The first animal\r\nhe met on the porch resembles an elephant; the others, looking east, have\r\nwings. Strangely enough he dismisses the sculptured stairs with a mere\r\npassing notice. He merely observes that the Columnar Edifice is reached\r\nby two single flights ‘whose sides are ornamented by bas-reliefs.’\r\nFollowing Della Valle, he correctly divides the columns into a central\r\ngroup of thirty-six and porticoes on the three sides; but he was wrong\r\nin conjecturing that the front row consisted of only eight columns in\r\ntwo rows of four, and in supposing that they were intended to support\r\nidols. Only nineteen were then standing, but there were two in the\r\nPorch, and another in the plain five hundred paces from the platform.\r\nHe noticed two others at a distance of three leagues ‘to the left.’ He\r\nobserved that the columns of the central group have a double capital\r\nresembling those in the Porch, and have round bases. From this great\r\nruin he ascended ten or twelve steps to the remains of some chambers,\r\nevidently the Palace of Darius. In front, he ‘saw the vestiges of several\r\nsmall columns,’ the first reference we have to the ruins of the Palace\r\nof Ochus. Turning towards the mountain, he came upon other chambers,\r\napparently the Palace of Xerxes from the description of the steps\r\ndescending abruptly to a lower platform. He also notes ‘a fine building\r\nwith bas-reliefs,’ possibly the Hall of the Hundred Columns. He mentions\r\nthe two sepulchres, where he observed a man with a bow sacrificing to\r\nan idol which resembles a satyr. He was unable to visit Naksh-i-Rustam.\r\nHe was greatly impressed by the general effect produced by these ruins,\r\nand he considered them ‘one of the finest remains of antiquity.’ He dwelt\r\nespecially upon the immense number of bas-reliefs; he estimated that\r\nthere were at least two thousand, many of them only showing their heads\r\nabove ground. In addition to the general view, he has drawn a few of\r\nthe bas-reliefs, among others that of the man sacrificing to the satyr.\r\nOthers represent the personage beneath the parasol, or fighting the lion.\r\nThese sketches are insignificant in size and execution, but they are a\r\ngreat advance upon the preposterous attempts of his predecessors. He\r\nshows an inscription round an arch, but it is of a purely imaginative\r\ncharacter; and he merely records the existence of letters ‘which no one\r\ncan read,’ many of which, he adds, were gilt. He adopted the opinion\r\nof Père Raphael that the edifice was a Temple and erected by Assuerus,\r\nthough he tells us that others maintain that it was the Palace of Darius.\r\n\r\nA year after the publication of the ‘Beautés de la Perse’ a much more\r\nprosaic narrative appeared (1674), written by Daulier’s travelling\r\ncompanion, M. de Thévenot.[41] De Thévenot was born at Paris, in 1633. He\r\nfound himself at an early age in possession of independent means, and he\r\nbegan his travels at nineteen. He first visited England, which seems to\r\nhave been then regarded as the training ground where the traveller might\r\nbe inured to the perils of foreign adventure (1652). He subsequently\r\nvisited Holland and Germany, and he spent a few years in Italy. He had\r\nthe advantage of meeting M. d’Herbelot at Rome, who afterwards gained\r\na great reputation as a linguist and Orientalist. It may have been the\r\nincentive communicated from this source that determined Thévenot to visit\r\nthe East and to devote himself to the acquisition of Eastern languages.\r\nThe two friends planned a journey together, but at the last moment\r\nd’Herbelot was prevented from leaving. Thévenot left Rome in 1655, at the\r\nmature age of twenty-two, and passed a considerable time visiting the\r\nislands of the Mediterranean, Turkey, the Levant and Egypt.[42] After an\r\nabsence of seven years, he returned to Paris and published an account of\r\nhis journey, which appeared in 1664, in two volumes. He had taken pains\r\nto acquire several Oriental languages, Turkish, Arabic and Persian, and\r\nwhile staying in Paris, he devoted himself to the study of such sciences\r\nas were then within reach. The proof-sheets of his book were scarcely dry\r\nwhen he left for Persia (October 1663). His route lay by Aleppo to Mosul,\r\nwhich he reached about the end of July 1664. From thence he dropped down\r\nthe Tigris to Bagdad, and struck across by Hamadan to Ispahan, where he\r\narrived in October.[43] Here he remained the guest of Père Raphael till\r\nFebruary 1665, when he took the opportunity of going to Bunder Abbas in\r\nthe suite of Tavernier. The larger portion of the baggage mules were\r\nemployed in carrying the merchandise of that enterprising traveller to\r\nthe coast; but it does not appear that he himself joined the party till\r\nthey were far on the road. They arrived at Bunder together, and here\r\nThévenot was destined to meet with a severe disappointment. The French\r\nwere at that time making an attempt to revive their East India Company,\r\na step that roused the jealousy of the Dutch to such an extent that\r\nthey positively refused to give him a passage. They wished to preserve\r\nthe secrets of the trade entirely to themselves, and Thévenot feared\r\nthat even if he were received on board, their patriotism might go to\r\nthe length of imperilling his life.[44] At Bunder Abbas itself, where\r\nthe Dutch had recently become completely the masters, he scarcely found\r\nhimself safe. The only person he could trust was the agent of the English\r\nCompany, who took him under his protection and gave out that he was an\r\nEnglishman. He was compelled, therefore, to return to Shiraz, and it was\r\non this occasion that he enjoyed the companionship of Daulier Deslandes.\r\nThey visited the ruins of Persepolis, and Thévenot made copious notes of\r\nhis impressions. In the autumn he made his way to Bassora, where he found\r\na passage to India on board an Armenian vessel. He seems to have returned\r\nin the spring of 1667 in company with Tavernier.[45] On their way from\r\nBunder Abbas they once more visited Persepolis, and upon this occasion\r\nthey found Chardin there. Thus by a singular accident the three great\r\ntravellers stood together among the historic ruins.[46] Thévenot died\r\nsoon afterwards, at the early age of thirty-four, at Maiana, the ancient\r\nAtropatena, thirty leagues from Tauris (November 1667). Two volumes of\r\nhis Travels, up to the time of his arrival at Surat, were published in\r\n1674, and a third, on India, in 1684. A complete edition appeared in five\r\nvolumes in 1689. Numerous others followed, and before the end of the\r\ncentury the work had been translated into English, Dutch and German.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said that Thévenot’s description of Persepolis contributed\r\nmuch to the elucidation of the plan of the building. He, however, gives\r\nan accurate though somewhat complicated description of the double\r\nstaircase. He explains for the first time the position of the animals on\r\nthe pilasters of the Porch—their heads facing the front, and their half\r\nbodies in demi-ronde adorning the inside of the passage. He thought they\r\nwere cut out of a single block, those facing the stairs representing\r\nelephants and the others griffins. He gives a fair account of the\r\nsculptured wall, which previous travellers had so frequently overlooked.\r\nHe describes the projection in the centre, with a single stair at either\r\nend, and the single flights at each end of the terrace. They are, he\r\nsays, almost entirely buried beneath rubbish, which may perhaps account\r\nfor their having so frequently escaped observation. ‘Nevertheless one\r\nsees several figures on that portion of the wall of the terrace which is\r\nabove ground.’ He noticed the combat—a lion and bull—and the three rows\r\nof bas-reliefs, representing, as he thought, a sacrifice or a triumph.\r\nHe observed the various arms of the men, and the different animals, the\r\nsheep, oxen and dromedary, that figure in the procession. He conducts the\r\nreader up the stairs to the platform strewn with columns, some buried,\r\nsome broken, and others marked only by their bases. Seventeen were then\r\nstanding, and he conjectured that there were originally twelve rows of\r\nnine in each. He remarked the strange style of the capitals, and fancied\r\nthey had been surmounted by statues, or perhaps by idols. He proceeds\r\nto the square building beyond, where he beheld ‘an old man followed by\r\ntwo valets,’ one holding a parasol and the other a crozier. But at this\r\npoint his narrative becomes confused and we follow him with difficulty.\r\nIn his description of the eastern part of the platform, however, he\r\nenumerates six distinct buildings, which appear to be formed by the ruins\r\nof the Great Hall of the Hundred Columns and those of the Central Edifice\r\nunited. Although the description of the arrangement of these buildings is\r\nhopelessly confused, we obtain for the first time an adequate account of\r\nthe remarkable bas-reliefs found among them. He describes the personage\r\nseated upon a chair of state, a staff or sceptre in his hand, while\r\nbeneath him are three rows of figures, one over the other, with uplifted\r\narms, supporting those above. The winged figure is, he says, an idol\r\nseated upon an arc, with the body passed through a ring. He found another\r\nsimilar piece of sculpture with three rows of figures among these ruins,\r\nand he also mentions the great bas-relief in the north door of the Hall,\r\nwhere the seated personage is elevated above five rows of figures, but he\r\nfailed to notice that these were guards.[47] He divides the edifices on\r\nthe platform into three rows of buildings one behind the other from west\r\nto east, the first two ‘rows’ containing, he says, each four buildings\r\nand the third five, of which the third is the largest, and we thus arrive\r\nat the thirteen buildings in all. His description of the Tombs is more\r\nintelligible. They resemble, he says, the façade of a temple cut into\r\nthe rock. Below are four columns with capitals representing the head and\r\nthroat of an ox. In the centre is the entrance to the tombs. They support\r\nan architrave approaching to Doric in style, and ornamented by lions.\r\nAbove are two rows of arcades composed of human figures about two feet in\r\nheight. Over them, in the centre, is an idol, resembling a winged man.\r\nOn the right is a person praying, and to the left a pedestal surmounted\r\nby a globe. At either end is a portion of a round column with the head\r\nof a bull, and below, on each side of the second row are two men, one\r\nover the other, armed with pikes. It was impossible to gain access to\r\nthis tomb, for it was full of water, but on entering the other to the\r\nsouth of it he found three sepulchres cut into the rock like the basins\r\nof a fountain. In the centre of the cave is a slab that appears to cover\r\na tomb. Beyond the platform, to the south, he observed a single column\r\nstill standing, and to the north the ruins of a porch. On his way to\r\nNaksh-i-Rustam, he observed on his right hand another column standing. He\r\nwas inclined to believe that Chehel Minar had been a temple, for it is\r\nevident the buildings have never been roofed, and the site itself was not\r\nlarge enough for a palace.[48] Finally, he apologises for the confusion\r\nin which part of his narrative is involved, and protests, probably with\r\ntruth, that if he had added anything more to his description he might\r\nonly have increased its obscurity.\r\n\r\nTwo years later, Tavernier added his contribution to the subject[49]\r\n(1676). Although he seems, as we have said, to have visited Persepolis\r\nalong with Daulier, in March 1665, yet he was evidently but little\r\ninfluenced by his opinion. He had seen the ruins several times, and his\r\njudgment on the subject had been no doubt already formed. He tells us\r\nthat on the occasion of one of his visits he was accompanied by an artist\r\nnamed Angel, a Dutchman, who, it appears, was commissioned by Abbas II.\r\nto make drawings of the ruins; and the estimates they formed are in\r\nstriking contrast to those of Daulier. Tavernier was too much concerned\r\nwith practical affairs to be greatly interested in antiquarian research;\r\nand his eye, trained to dwell on the minute beauty of the precious\r\nstones, saw little to admire in colossal mounds of chiselled marble. Nor\r\nwas the prosaic Dutchman who accompanied him more susceptible to this\r\nform of beauty. Angel spent eight days in making drawings of the various\r\nruins, and in the end expressed regret that he had wasted so much of\r\nhis time. As for Tavernier, he declared he did not consider them worth\r\nthe labour of a quarter of an hour. The bas-reliefs seemed to him to be\r\nwretchedly executed, and he could only recollect to have counted twelve\r\ncolumns.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards there appeared a book by Jean Struys, a Dutchman, whom\r\nSir W. Ouseley rightly styles ‘the lying traveller.’[50] In it there is\r\nan engraving of what is called the ‘Tomb of Persepolis,’ which is such\r\na grotesque misrepresentation that we can scarcely believe even Struys\r\nresponsible for the vagaries of the artist he employed. He observed that\r\nthe number of columns had been reduced to eighteen, and he estimated\r\ntheir height at thirty-eight feet. He was especially struck by the beauty\r\nof the staircase; and he was the first to make the correct suggestion\r\nthat the animals guarding the porch were lions. He noted the numerous\r\nbas-reliefs whose beauty had not yet been effaced by time; but he fancied\r\nhe saw battle scenes depicted among them. He thought the cuneiform\r\n‘characters strangely resembled the Arabian, though no one has yet been\r\nable to decipher them.’[51]\r\n\r\nAn agent of the East India Company, Mr. S. Flower, made a collection of\r\nvarious inscriptions, and among others of ‘one consisting of two lines\r\nin the nail character, or pyramidal shape, such as is impressed on some\r\nbricks lately found in the neighbouring countries.’ These appeared in the\r\n‘Philosophical Transactions’ of 1693, and were reproduced by Dr. Hyde,\r\nwho, quoting Flower, says that the characters are not found except at\r\nPersepolis, though some missionaries say they are known and in use in\r\nEgypt. He adds that they appear to be written from left to right. The\r\ninscription as copied in Hyde is punctuated after each letter,[52] and\r\nexhibits a miscellaneous collection of characters selected from the three\r\ndescriptions of writing.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said it will be seen that down to the end of the\r\nseventeenth century, or a hundred years after the visit of Gouvea to\r\nPersepolis, the chief authorities upon the subject were still Don Garcia\r\nand Della Valle. Herbert perhaps enjoyed a wider popularity, but so far\r\nas his account was correct he depended chiefly upon other writers. The\r\ndescription given by Mandelslo and Daulier added little to the knowledge\r\nalready acquired. Mere verbal descriptions, however, even by the most\r\ngraphic writer, could never convey so vivid an impression to the mind\r\nas a pictorial representation. The drawings made by Don Garcia were\r\nnot reproduced by his translators, and if they enriched the original\r\nSpanish edition, that work is so little known, that it has not even yet\r\nfound its way to the British Museum. The drawings of Della Valle had not\r\nthen[53] and, we believe, have never since been published. Mandelslo gave\r\na tolerable drawing of the tomb at Murgab; but his view of Persepolis\r\nis little better than the plates in the earlier editions of Herbert.\r\nThe English translator omitted them, and it is little likely that a book\r\nwritten in German and published in the remote town of Schleswig ever\r\nenjoyed a wide circulation. The engraving given by Herbert, even in his\r\nlatest edition, is still grossly incorrect. It was executed by an artist\r\nwho had never visited the spot, and Herbert was himself entirely unable\r\nto convey a true idea of the appearance and position of the different\r\nruins. Daulier Deslandes at length made a great advance upon all his\r\npredecessors, and placed the student in a position to form a tolerable\r\nconception of the general aspect of the buildings.\r\n\r\nStill less progress had yet been made towards the reproduction of the\r\ncuneiform letters. Della Valle had given five of the characters in the\r\nItalian edition of his Travels, but his French translators omitted them.\r\nHerbert contributed three lines; Daulier gave a short inscription taken\r\nfrom an arch; and Flower had quite recently increased the available\r\nmaterial by two lines. They were all very imperfectly copied, but it was\r\nknown that large numbers of similar inscriptions appeared in various\r\nparts of the ruins. Dr. Hyde, the learned Orientalist, concluded that\r\nthey were not letters at all, but simply designed as ornamentation. He\r\nentirely repudiated the suggestion, which was already current, that they\r\nhad any resemblance to Chinese.[54] He went so far as to upbraid the\r\nartist for having been the cause of so much torment to critics and men of\r\nlearning. The whole matter was, he declared, beneath his notice, and he\r\nwould not have alluded to it if he had not feared that his silence might\r\nbe misconstrued.[55]\r\n\r\nThis opinion was occasionally repeated both in France and Germany down\r\nto the close of the eighteenth century. Early in that century, however,\r\nthe materials for forming a more accurate judgment began rapidly to\r\naccumulate. The three travellers Chardin, Kaempfer and Le Bruyn all made\r\nimportant contributions to the subject. Chardin was the son of a rich\r\njeweller in Paris, and early in life he was sent on business to Persia\r\nand India. On his return in 1681 he settled in England and was knighted\r\nby Charles II., who afterwards sent him to Holland as his ambassador.\r\nChardin’s three visits to Persepolis were made as far back as 1666,\r\n1667 and 1674, but his account of it did not appear till 1711. It was\r\npublished at the same time in two different forms: in three volumes\r\nquarto and in ten volumes duodecimo, but with the same text and plates.\r\nThis edition was somewhat expurgated to avoid giving offence to the\r\nCatholics, but another came out in 1735, which included the suppressed\r\npassages. Chardin died in London in January 1713, two years after the\r\npublication of the complete edition of his Travels, but before he\r\nhad time to finish the most cherished work of his life, which was a\r\nCommentary on the Bible, based upon his knowledge of Oriental customs. It\r\nis said he was assisted in the composition of his works by Charpentier, a\r\nMember of the French Academy, and the magnificent drawings, twenty-three\r\nin number, made of Persepolis, are the work of M. Grélot, whom he brought\r\nwith him for the purpose.[56] They convey a most admirable impression,\r\nand the student can for the first time realise the splendour of the\r\nruins: which he could never have grasped from the confused description of\r\ntravellers.\r\n\r\nThey include two general views upon a large scale. In the first a few\r\ninaccuracies detract somewhat from its value. We observe birds of a\r\nhighly imaginative design perched upon the columns of the Porch; but\r\nwhether they are designed to represent portions of the capital, or\r\nmerely temporary visitors, does not appear. The sculptured stairs are\r\nincorrectly represented, showing only a single ascent, and without the\r\nprojecting flight in the centre—a deficiency removed in the description\r\ngiven in the text. The columns are massed too closely together; the\r\nPalace of Darius is placed on the south-west extremity of the platform,\r\nin the position that should be left vacant for the Palace of Ochus;\r\nand the stairs appear on the north instead of on the south side of the\r\nPalace. On the other hand, we find the Hall of the Hundred Columns\r\ncorrectly placed for the first time on the same elevation as the Porch.\r\nThe second view is more valuable. It is taken from about the same place\r\nas Niebuhr subsequently selected. The eye first rests upon the Hall of\r\nthe Hundred Columns with the cistern and entrance porch to the right.\r\nLooking southwards, the Columnar Edifice is seen to occupy a prominent\r\nposition, and beyond it lies the Palace of Darius, standing upon its own\r\nterrace, but, by an unaccountable error, with the façade turned to the\r\neast instead of the south. It appears unduly cramped between the columns\r\nand the Palace of Xerxes, which rises upon its terrace at an apparent\r\nelevation considerably higher than that of Darius. The double stairs\r\nleading to it on the east, and the straight flight down to the southern\r\nterrace are given. Under the hill we see a tolerable representation of\r\nthe south-east edifice, and as we turn back to the Hall of the Hundred\r\nColumns we observe a poor representation of the Central Edifice. There\r\nis a tendency to represent the ruins in too perfect a condition: the\r\nlower portion of the massive piers at the entrance have the appearance\r\nof being intact; the eastern stairs of Xerxes are also represented as\r\nfar too well preserved, and the artist has entirely omitted the great\r\nmound opposite the Central Edifice. Apart from these defects, the\r\ndrawing gives an intelligent design of the place, and it will enable\r\nthe reader to recover from the nightmare into which he may have fallen\r\nafter reading the account of Thévenot, and even the description of\r\nChardin himself. The other plates are devoted to separate drawings of\r\nthe more remarkable objects. One (Plate 54) makes the first attempt to\r\nreduce the platform to scale; but the buildings are not indicated upon\r\nit. Another gives the Great Staircase (Plate 55); two are devoted to the\r\nPorch (Plates 56 and 57); two to the Sculptured Stairs (Plates 58 and\r\n59); two to the Columns of the Hall of Xerxes (Plates 60 and 61). The\r\nbas-reliefs are treated with special attention. Besides those on the\r\nPorch and the Sculptured Stairs, we are shown the King walking beneath\r\nthe parasol (Plate 62); seated upon the chair of state above the five\r\nrows of guards (Plate 63); and again over the three rows of suppliants\r\n(Plate 64). Special plates are devoted to his contests with wild animals\r\n(Plate 65), and to the guards at the entrance to the Palaces (Plate 66).\r\nA plate is devoted to each of the Tombs on the hill (Plates 67 and 68),\r\nand another to a general view of the tombs at Naksh-i-Rustam. By means\r\nof these admirable drawings the Persepolitan ruins received their first\r\nadequate illustration. Daulier had indeed contributed a general view of\r\nsome excellence; but the few and insignificant sketches he attempted\r\nof the bas-reliefs were the only drawings that had yet appeared. It is\r\ndoubtful whether anything much better has since been produced than the\r\nmagnificent views of the sculpture on the Great Portal of the Hall of the\r\nHundred Columns and the drawing of the Tombs overhanging the Platform.\r\nThe sculptured staircase is drawn upon an immense scale. It fills two\r\nplates, one opening out in length equal to twelve pages of the book,\r\nand the other to five or six pages. The execution is admirable as a\r\nwork of art, and as such it has perhaps never been surpassed. In point\r\nof fidelity to the subject it may not be more in error than many of\r\nits successors. At that period the sculptures were no doubt in a more\r\nperfect condition than they since became after a lapse of a century or\r\ntwo, and Chardin describes them as being in his day ‘still so complete\r\nand so sharply defined that the work appears to have only just come\r\nfrom the sculptors’ hands.’ The plates are no doubt far from reaching\r\nphotographic accuracy; but this objection applies, if not equally, to the\r\nlater drawings of Porter and Flandin. When we look at the general view of\r\nthe platform and observe the remarkable precision with which the various\r\nruins are marked upon it, we are surprised to find the description in\r\nthe text so complicated and confused.[57] The pencil of the artist seems\r\nto have followed with perfect clearness the relation to each other of\r\nthe various parts of the ruins; but in Chardin’s account of them, from\r\nthe point where he leaves the Columnar Edifice, we become lost in his\r\ndescription of a perfect maze of apparently isolated structures. When we\r\nadvance from ‘the marvellous temple choir,’ as he calls that edifice, and\r\nproceed to follow his ‘straight line,’ we can only very dimly recognise\r\nwhere we are going. It is not, indeed, till we arrive at the Tombs that\r\nwe once more recover consciousness of our position. While nothing can\r\nbe learned of the general disposition of the ruins from the account of\r\nChardin, he has furnished a careful description of detached portions\r\nof the edifice. From him we learn that there are inscriptions over the\r\nanimals on the Porch. He gives a long and minute description of the\r\nbas-reliefs on the sculptured staircase. He shows that the dress and\r\narms of the various figures are intended to indicate the countries from\r\nwhich they came, and he accompanies his dissertation with much learned\r\ncommentary. He thought the Columnar Edifice had originally consisted\r\nof twelve rows of ten columns, or one hundred and twenty in all; and\r\nhe is quite sure he counted three rows with ten in each. He noted also\r\nthat ‘the capitals are different, not only in their ornamentation but\r\nalso in the fact that some are single and others double.’ The conflict\r\nbetween men and animals depicted on the side doors he thought represented\r\nthe struggle of heroes with different nations, which, as in the Book\r\nof Daniel, were symbolically represented by animals. He considered the\r\nstately personage under the parasol united in his own person the offices\r\nof both priest and king. The winged figure seemed to him to represent the\r\nsoul ascending to heaven, amid the clouds of sacrifice; and he rejected\r\nthe impious conjecture that it denoted a serpent or satyr or worse. He\r\nwas fully convinced that the ruins were those of a temple and that the\r\nColumnar Edifice had been the ‘choir’ where the victims were immolated.\r\nThe great difficulty of supposing that the principal buildings had ever\r\nbeen roofed favoured the supposition of its ecclesiastical character. He\r\nreviews at great length the different opinions as to its origin; some\r\nascribe it to the period before the Deluge, others to Solomon; but he\r\nfinally decides in favour of Jamshid, the fourth King of Persia, who,\r\nhe ascertained, had flourished about the time of the descent of Jacob\r\ninto Egypt.[58] This opinion as he takes care to emphasise, would throw\r\nback the construction of the edifice many centuries before Darius. The\r\nidea that the ruins represented the castle and palace of Persepolis\r\nwas first advocated by Don Garcia, but it had long lost its popularity\r\nand the rival opinion first put forward by Della Valle, that they were\r\nthe remains of a temple had already secured the adhesion of Daulier\r\nand Thévenot. Chardin now gave it the support of his authority, and he\r\naffected to scout the opposite view as ‘a vain and ridiculous tradition,’\r\nalthough later investigation has affirmed its truth. He was followed by\r\nKaempfer, and encouraged by the English traveller Fryer, who qualified\r\nthe opinion that it was ‘Cambyses’ Hall’ with the doubt that it might\r\nafter all ‘be the ruins of some heathen temple.’[59]\r\n\r\nPassing to the tombs, he rightly conjectured that the round object above\r\nthe fire altar represented the sun, ‘the great divinity of the Persians.’\r\nMore adventurous than Thévenot, he effected an entrance into the northern\r\ntomb over the Hall of the Hundred Columns, and describes it as a square\r\nspace of twenty-two feet and twelve feet high. At the side he noticed two\r\ntombs of white marble sixty-two by twenty-six inches and thirty inches\r\nhigh, both full of water. Chardin thought that the entire façade of the\r\ntomb was concealed after its construction by a covering of earth. It was\r\nthe common belief of the country people that Nimrod had been buried in\r\nthe first of these tombs and Darius in the second, but Chardin thought\r\nthat both had been occupied long before the time of Darius.\r\n\r\nHe mentions the column in the plain three hundred paces from the\r\nplatform, perfect except the capital. From this spot across to\r\nNaksh-i-Rustam ruins may be seen scattered over the whole plain and it\r\nwas here he thought the city of Persepolis had stood, with the Temple to\r\nthe east and the Tombs to the west. It reached northwards between the\r\nhills where fallen columns, pieces of architraves and bas-reliefs might\r\nbe observed, and he was told that there were traces of ruins within a\r\ncircuit of ten leagues.\r\n\r\nChehel Minar is honeycombed by subterranean passages, possibly drains\r\nor aqueducts, and Chardin explored several of them. He found one of\r\nsufficient height to walk through upright, and he advanced nearly a\r\nmile, when he was forced to return. The people of the country told him\r\nit extended for six leagues and leads to subterranean tombs. A similar\r\npassage connects the temple with Naksh-i-Rustam.\r\n\r\nChardin noted many inscriptions among the ruins, sometimes even upon\r\nthe robes of the figures.[60] He observes that the strange characters\r\nare sometimes three inches in height, and there can be no doubt that\r\nsome of them, especially the capitals, were gilt. This was in fact the\r\nopinion of several of the early travellers, such as Mandelslo and Daulier\r\nDeslandes; while Herbert saw gilding on the bas-reliefs themselves.\r\nThe writing is composed of only two kinds of characters: one resembles\r\nan oblique triangle, the other a pyramid. The first has ‘la pointe ou\r\nangulaire, ou en bas ou en travers.’ The second may assume six postures:\r\n‘when perpendicular, the pointed end may be either top or bottom; when\r\nhorizontal, either to left or right; when diagonal, it may point either\r\nway.’ It may be read not only from left to right, but also from top to\r\nbottom like Chinese. Some consider the writing is purely hieroglyphical,\r\nbut Chardin thinks it is a true writing like our own—but it will be\r\nimpossible ever to tell whether it has vowels, or anything else about\r\nit. In order to illustrate his opinion concerning the various directions\r\nin which the characters might be read, he made a copy of the inscription\r\nthat runs round the window of the Palace of Darius. This is the first\r\ncomplete inscription ever copied, and unfortunately it contributed much\r\nto impede the progress of decipherment.[61] Although consisting of only\r\none line, it is in three different scripts, and its inspection served at\r\nonce to confirm the opinion of Chardin that the wedges might be turned\r\nin any direction—for to the left of the window we see the thick end of\r\nthe wedge at the bottom; on the right of the window it is in the reverse\r\nposition; while on the top it is turned to the left. It was long before\r\nit was discovered that this inscription was to be read, like the legend\r\nrunning round a coin—the line to the left being written running up; and\r\nthe line to the right running down; so that in reality the wedge always\r\npreserves the same direction.\r\n\r\nHe visited Naksh-i-Rustam, and was the first to give an account of the\r\nInscriptions on the second tomb. The one above consists, he says, of\r\nfifteen lines; the other near the cornice and the door is shorter. He\r\ninduced his valet, by an offer of three crowns, to explore the interior,\r\nand he was probably the first European who ever accomplished the task. He\r\nwas encountered at the narrow entrance by an immense flight of pigeons,\r\nat first mistaken for demons, who were terrified by his intrusion and\r\nhastened to make their escape. He reported that the cave measured forty\r\npaces in a straight line from the entrance and thirty on either side.\r\nFacing the entrance he noticed the lids of three sarcophagi upon the\r\nground, and to right and left were four tombs each six feet long.[62]\r\n\r\nThe general impression left upon his mind by the contemplation of\r\nPersepolis was that the ruins were the most magnificent he had ever\r\nseen.[63] Although not without fault, they are, taken as a whole,\r\ncharacterised by excellent taste and worthy of admiration for the amount\r\nof labour that lies concealed as well as for that which is displayed. He\r\nattributed the destruction of the building more to the religious zeal of\r\nthe Mohamedans than to time. Istakhr early became the seat of a Viceroy\r\nof the Khalifs, and since then the work of demolition has never ceased.\r\nEven Shah Abbas adorned his palace at Ispahan with some of its marbles,\r\nand others found their way to Shiraz. Not long before Chardin’s visit the\r\ngovernor of that place gave orders that sixty men should be employed in\r\nsystematic destruction directed chiefly against the human figures; but\r\nfortunately his orders were not fully carried into execution.\r\n\r\nThe year after the appearance of Chardin’s account of Persepolis\r\nEngelbert Kaempfer published his Travels, (1712) which include a\r\ndescription of the same monument.[64] He was a German physician who went\r\nto Persia in 1684 in the capacity of secretary to the Swedish Envoy, and\r\nhe subsequently remained as surgeon to the Dutch fleet stationed in the\r\nPersian Gulf. His visit to Persepolis occurred twelve years later than\r\nthat of Chardin, but unfortunately he was not accompanied by a skilful\r\nartist (1686). He treats us to five drawings of Persepolis and three of\r\nNaksh-i-Rustam. The former include two general views of the Platform,\r\none taken from the west and the other from the east: the Porch, the\r\nsculptured stairs and the great door of the Hall of the Hundred Columns.\r\nThey are quite unworthy to be compared either in design or execution with\r\nthose of Chardin. But if it were not for the exceptional excellence of\r\nthe latter, we should feel more grateful to Kaempfer and his successor\r\nLe Bruyn. As it is, Kaempfer’s drawing of the sculptured stairs almost\r\ncarries us back to the archaic period of art represented by Herbert,\r\nand may best be described as grotesque. He is more successful in the\r\ntreatment of the façade of a tomb at Naksh-i-Rustam. He has, however,\r\nmerits peculiar to himself. The first attempt to draw the platform to\r\nscale was made by Chardin; but Kaempfer improved upon this example by\r\nmarking the position and outline of the principal ruins upon it; and has\r\nthus afforded the student invaluable assistance to guide him through the\r\nintricacies of all future descriptions. He has added to its clearness by\r\nnumbering each of the ruins: a system he has also followed in his general\r\nview.\r\n\r\nBut of still greater importance was the attention he directed to the\r\nInscriptions. It is to him we owe the designation of ‘cuneiform’ from the\r\nwedge-like appearance of the signs that compose the groups—a name they\r\nhave since retained. He considered that the writing was ideographic, as\r\nin the Chinese; it was unknown elsewhere, but here it was found cut into\r\nthe doors, windows, statues and walls, and it was certainly contemporary\r\nwith the construction of the edifice. He was told that the hollow\r\nformed by the excision was formerly filled in with gold, which had been\r\nremoved by the cupidity of subsequent ages, though he fancied he could\r\nstill detect traces of it in some places. He was particularly struck\r\nby the appearance of an inscription on the south wall of the Terrace.\r\nIt occupied a slab no less than ten paces in length, and was divided\r\ninto four tablets, each containing twenty-four lines. He copied the one\r\non his right hand as carefully as the difficulties of the situation\r\nwould permit; he was unfortunately prevented from copying the others,\r\nbut he observed that the characters in them varied to a certain extent.\r\nThe inscription he gave was afterwards known as the ‘L of Niebuhr,’\r\nand belongs to the third or Babylonian system of writing.[65] He has\r\ntranscribed the whole of the twenty-four lines, and it was by far the\r\nlongest text that had ever yet been published to the world. Although the\r\ncopy is defective when compared with the perfection that has since been\r\nachieved, yet as a first attempt upon so large a scale it deserves high\r\ncommendation. He also gives the trilingual inscription round a window in\r\nthe Palace of Darius, but in this he had been anticipated by Chardin.[66]\r\n\r\nHe is careful also to direct the reader’s attention to the position of\r\ninscriptions in other parts of the ruins. He mentions the inscription\r\nover the animals in the Porch (of which, however, we had already heard\r\nfrom Chardin), but he also fixes the position of the inscription\r\nin twenty-four lines on the sculptured stairs;[67] of the three\r\ninscriptions on the south stairs of the Palace of Darius;[68] of the\r\nthree inscriptions, each of six lines, over the bas-relief on the great\r\ndoors of the same edifice,[69] and of the three inscriptions, each of\r\nfour lines, in the corresponding position in the Palace of Xerxes.[70]\r\nKaempfer favoured the opinion then most generally accepted that the\r\nbuilding was a temple rather than a palace, and he considered that the\r\ncolumns were designed to support a roof.[71] He gives the earliest\r\ndescription we have of the central edifice, and he explains clearly the\r\nnature of the building. It consists, he says, of the remains of three\r\nmassive doors and the bases of two columns and although these ruins are\r\nfew in number he declares they are superb.[72]\r\n\r\nHe remarked that two months would be scarcely long enough to sketch the\r\nprincipal objects, and he could only spare three days.\r\n\r\nNearly twenty years later the ruins were visited by another traveller\r\nwho had more time at his disposal. Corneille le Bruyn arrived early in\r\nNovember 1704 and occupied himself for three months in sketching and\r\nmeasuring the various edifices.[73] Unfortunately, the result is scarcely\r\nequal to the effort. His book, which was published at Amsterdam in 1718,\r\ncontains eight plates of Persepolis; but they are greatly inferior to\r\nthose of Chardin and are executed on too small a scale to assist the\r\nstudent in following the diffuse and confused description given in the\r\ntext. Two plates are devoted to four general views taken from different\r\npoints. In these the buildings are indicated by letters, which refer the\r\nreader to the text, and they enable him to apprehend some of the more\r\nobscure statements made by the writer. One plate is devoted to views of\r\nthe great stairs and entrance portico. Two others reproduce the figures\r\non the sculptured stairs. Though inferior to the same views given by\r\nChardin, they are immeasurably superior to the one by Kaempfer and fall\r\nlittle short of those subsequently executed by Niebuhr. The remaining\r\nplates contain a number of small vignettes, which convey but a poor\r\nimpression of the objects they are designed to represent. Le Bruyn has,\r\nhowever, devoted one of the plates to Inscriptions and this is the most\r\nimportant work he has achieved in connection with this subject. He has\r\ncopied five separate inscriptions, four of which were now published for\r\nthe first time. (1) The Inscription on the Sculptured Stairs.[74] (2) The\r\nInscription on the pilaster in the Portico of the Palace of Darius.[75]\r\nIt is in three tablets, each tablet containing from thirteen to fifteen\r\nlines. (3) The Inscription seen over the King in the same palace.[76] It\r\nis also in three tablets, each containing six lines. (4) The Inscription\r\nin the folds of the royal robe—of which seven lines are given.[77] (5)\r\nFinally, he has reproduced the window Inscription already published by\r\nChardin and Kaempfer, but instead of representing it as it occurs round\r\na window, he has placed the three lines under one another in parallel\r\nlines.[78] By this simple change of position he has shown the fallacy of\r\nthe theory that the lines at the sides may be read from top to bottom:\r\nor that the wedge can occur with the point upwards. Le Bruyn is a more\r\naccurate copyist than Kaempfer, and in some respects he even excels\r\nOuseley, a hundred years later. With Le Bruyn the cuneiforms assume the\r\nbold and regular appearance with which we are now familiar, although he\r\nconfuses many of the letters by too great compression.\r\n\r\nLe Bruyn appears to have been one of the first travellers to attempt\r\nto make a collection of these antiquities to send home to Europe. The\r\nextreme hardness of the stone severely taxed the strength of his tools,\r\nand it was with considerable difficulty that he secured a piece from a\r\nwindow covered with cuneiform characters, and some other smaller objects.\r\nThese he despatched through the agent of the Dutch East India Company to\r\nthe Burgomaster of Amsterdam. So far as we know, the only other specimens\r\nof cuneiforms that had hitherto been seen in Europe were those picked up\r\nby Della Valle on the site of Babylon and sent to the Kircherian Museum.\r\n\r\nHe was not very happy in some of his criticisms. He described the animals\r\non the Entrance Portico as having a likeness to the Sphinx with the body\r\nof a horse and the feet of a lion. He imagined that the animal attacked\r\nby the lion on the sculptured stairs was a horse or even an ass. The\r\nobject that separates the various groups in the same place he describes\r\nas a vase. He considered the capital surmounting the columns was the\r\nfigure of a kneeling camel. He is about the only competent observer,\r\nwith the exception of Niebuhr, who discerned female figures among the\r\nsculptures.[79] He appears to say that there are no less than forty-six\r\nof these in the Palace of Darius alone: among them are the King’s\r\nattendants bearing the fly-chaser and parasol. He estimates the total\r\nof human figures among the ruins at 1300; and, judging by the number of\r\nbases, he considered there were originally not less than two hundred\r\nand five columns.[80] He gives the measurements of the buildings, the\r\nsize and number of the figures with a detail that becomes irksome and\r\nbewildering. The reader often regrets that he did not make better use of\r\nhis pen and pencil, and spare him some of the results of the measuring\r\ntape. He is by no means too lavish of his praise. He censured the figures\r\nas stiff and devoid of animation; the nude he found represented without\r\nanatomical skill and the draperies without taste. He admits, however,\r\nthat the ornamentations, when they occur, are beautiful. He was of\r\nopinion that all the stone for the construction of the various edifices\r\ncame from the neighbouring mountains, where he observed all the various\r\nshades found at Persepolis. He had the good sense to reject the foolish\r\ntheory supported by Chardin as to the Jamshid origin of the ruins; and he\r\ncould see no evidence that they had ever been used as a temple. On the\r\ncontrary, he considered that they had been a palace, and his conviction\r\nthat the columns had originally supported a roof lessens the difficulty\r\nof accepting that view. He argues with some force and great diffuseness\r\nthat it could only have been the Palace of the Achaemenides destroyed\r\nby Alexander: an opinion confirmed by later investigation, and one\r\nthat greatly facilitated the attempt made by Grotefend to decipher the\r\ninscriptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nNIEBUHR TO DE MORGAN. A.D. 1765-1897\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was more than sixty years before any farther contribution was made\r\nto the knowledge of Persepolis. In 1761, however, the King of Denmark,\r\nFrederic V., fitted out an expedition chiefly for the purpose of\r\nexploring Arabia. Five commissioners were nominated, to each of whom a\r\nspecial branch of inquiry was assigned. Among them was Carston Niebuhr,\r\nthe father of the writer whose historical works agitated the early\r\npart of last century. They left Copenhagen in January of that year,\r\nand reached Constantinople after an adventurous voyage. From thence\r\nthey went to Egypt, and finally to Yeman, where they arrived in 1763.\r\nHere three out of the five explorers died, and the two survivors left\r\nfor Bombay in 1764. Soon afterwards another died, and Niebuhr, the\r\nsole survivor, determined to return home, and to take Persia and the\r\nEuphrates Valley on his way. He received many courtesies from the English\r\nmerchants settled at Bushire and Shiraz, especially from Mr. Hercules,\r\nthe agent of the East India Company, in whose house he lived at Shiraz.\r\nThrough his influence Niebuhr went on to Persepolis, furnished with\r\nthe best introductions to the chiefs of the neighbouring villages. He\r\narrived on the 13th of March, 1765, and remained till the 3rd of April.\r\nHe afterwards returned for two days to compare his sketches with the\r\noriginal. He wrote in German, and the French translation appeared in\r\n1780.[81]\r\n\r\nThe magnificent views of Persepolis given to the world by Chardin, and\r\nthe very useful plan drawn to scale by Kaempfer, had already afforded\r\nample material for forming a tolerably accurate conception of the general\r\naspect of the ruins. Little remained now to be done except to work for\r\nthe archæologist, to whom the minutest attention to detail was the first\r\nnecessity. Niebuhr, unfortunately, cannot claim to have accomplished this\r\ndifficult task, so far at least as his drawings are concerned. He has,\r\nhowever, contributed ten plates of illustrations of considerable artistic\r\nmerit. Following the example of Kaempfer, he begins with a ground plan\r\non which the various edifices are distinctly indicated by letters. This\r\nis followed by a general view looking towards the west; three plates\r\nare devoted to the sculptured stairs; one to the mysterious animals\r\non the porch that continued so long a stumbling-block; the Palaces of\r\nDarius and Xerxes each occupy a plate, and two others portray the seated\r\nfigures in the Hall of the Hundred Columns. He was so satisfied with\r\nthis achievement that he thought even the student would have no need of\r\nany farther assistance from the artist’s pencil.[82] This is, however,\r\nso far from the case, that even the general reader has some cause to\r\ncomplain.[83] Niebuhr has conveyed an entirely false conception of the\r\nappearance of the sculptured terrace by the omission of the broken line\r\nof sculpture, of which one half still remains above the other two. He\r\nhas also had the temerity to represent the figures as though they were\r\nperfect, though he states in the text that the larger number on one side\r\nare so mutilated that they are without their heads.[84] It would be\r\nimpossible in his drawings to distinguish the different nationalities;\r\nit is difficult even to detect the ‘Kaffir,’ as he calls the famed\r\nEthiopian.[85]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the description he has given of the ruins has the\r\nmerit of being more concise than that of Chardin, and we follow him\r\nthroughout with clearness. He was disposed to accept the theory that the\r\nedifice was originally a temple, the seat of an ecclesiastical chief,\r\ncomparable to the Roman Pontiff, who had gradually passed into a secular\r\nprince. He did not doubt that it finally became the residence of the\r\nAchaemenian Kings, and was the edifice destroyed by Alexander.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to refer to many of his criticisms. He had little\r\nhesitation in deciding that the animals on the Porch were griffins\r\n(licornes), and that a double griffin ornamented the capital of the\r\ncolumns. Besides griffins, he fancied he discerned women among the\r\nbas-reliefs, especially in the Palace of Xerxes.[86] He, however, made\r\nthe important observation that in the Columnar Edifice or Hall of Xerxes\r\nthe columns of the central cluster are four feet lower than those at the\r\nside, and that there are the remains of four walls that seem to indicate\r\nan entrance from the north. He did not consider that the evidence was\r\nsufficient to conclude, as was generally done, that this edifice must\r\nhave been necessarily open at the top; on the contrary, he suggests the\r\npossibility that the central group of columns supported a second stage,\r\nand the side colonnades a terrace.[87] He thought it probable that the\r\nwhole assemblage of columns—seventy-two in number—had originally formed\r\none immense building, which would have exceeded in size the Hall of the\r\nHundred Columns. With regard to the latter, he had no doubt that it also\r\nhad been roofed, and he observed numerous fragments of columns both in\r\nthe great hall and in the portico. Della Valle had long ago traced the\r\nbases of thirty-six columns in the Palace of Xerxes; Niebuhr now adds\r\nthe observation that there are four in each of the side rooms. He was\r\nalso the first to observe the third tomb to the south of the others near\r\nPersepolis that has been left incomplete.[88]\r\n\r\nBut his principal merit lies in the great service he has rendered towards\r\nthe solution of the mystery of the cuneiform letters. It is true he\r\nneglected to furnish a complete copy of all the inscriptions, which, with\r\nthe time at his disposal, he might perhaps have accomplished; but the\r\ncontributions he did make are of great value.\r\n\r\n(1) He copied the inscription on the west end of the sculptured terrace,\r\n25 lines, known as Inscription A.\r\n\r\n(2) The six-line inscription in three tablets over the king in the Palace\r\nof Darius: B, C, D.\r\n\r\n(3) The corresponding inscription in the Palace of Xerxes: E, F, G.\r\n\r\n(4) He also copied the large inscriptions in four tablets on the outside\r\nsouth wall of the platform: H, I, K, and L. They each fill twenty-four\r\nlines, and an idea of the size of the letters may be formed from the fact\r\nthat the original covers a space twenty-six feet long by six feet high.\r\n\r\nOf these Le Bruyn had already copied the A inscription in the drawing he\r\ngives of the stairs, the six-line inscription of Darius (B, C, D), and\r\na line of the inscription of Xerxes from the royal robe; while Kaempfer\r\ncopied one tablet (L) of the inscription on the south terrace.[89] The\r\nothers now appear for the first time. It has already been observed that\r\nKaempfer was the first to draw the characters with a bold and steady\r\nhand; in this he has been followed by Niebuhr, so that his copies\r\ndiffer in no respect from those produced in the present day. The few\r\nremarks he has made upon the subject are of peculiar value and very\r\nmaterially assisted later scholars. He was the first to observe that the\r\ninscriptions are written in three different ‘alphabets,’ and that these\r\nalways recurred together.[90] So slow is the progress of discovery,\r\nhowever, that he never seems to have advanced to what might appear to\r\nbe the obvious conclusion that the three tablets are repetitions of the\r\nsame text in different languages. He noted that the ‘alphabet’ in one\r\nof the tablets of the series was comparatively simple, and consisted of\r\nno more than forty-two different signs.[91] These he copied out, and\r\nthey appear in Plate 23. He thus limited the first step in decipherment\r\nto the interpretation of a comparatively small number of signs. Till\r\nthen the greatest confusion was produced by the appearance of detached\r\nportions of inscriptions, selected indifferently from all the three\r\nkinds of writing, a process that inspired the fear that the number of\r\nsigns to be mastered was practically unlimited. Having clearly detected\r\neach separate letter from among the number of confused signs in a line of\r\ninscription, he farther assisted the student by marking off each separate\r\nletter by a full stop or colon in the copies he made of the inscriptions\r\nthemselves.[92] From the division of the signs into letters he does not\r\nseem to have made the next step and apprehended the division of the lines\r\ninto words by the diagonal wedges in the Persian column. He, however,\r\ndirected attention to two different copies of the same inscription, where\r\nin one the letters that end the third line are in the other the first\r\nthat occur in the fourth line; he pointed out that this practically\r\nsettled the direction in which the writing should be read.[93] He also\r\nshowed that the lines supposed by Chardin to be written from top to\r\nbottom are not in reality upright, but should be placed on their side,\r\nand when horizontal the letters correspond to those already known.[94]\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the neighbourhood of Persepolis, Niebuhr visited Istakhr\r\nand Naksh-i-Rustam, but he did not go on to Murgab. At Istakhr he saw\r\ntwo columns still standing, and he noted the massive blocks of the\r\ngateway.[95] He made no attempt to enter any of the tombs, which he says\r\ncould not be done ‘without the risk of losing one’s life.’ That risk,\r\nsuch as it was, was, however, undertaken in the following year by Mr.\r\nHercules, who had provided himself with tools in the case of necessity;\r\nbut he found that some earlier visitor had pierced a hole through the\r\ntop, and that there was nothing but dust remaining. Niebuhr has not\r\nnoticed the inscription on the Tomb of Darius; but his accurate copies\r\nof the Pehlevi made at this spot and at Naksh-i-Rejeb opposite were the\r\nfirst that enabled Silvestre de Sacy to translate that language.\r\n\r\nWe shall see in a future chapter that before the close of the century\r\nthe writings of Le Bruyn and Niebuhr had attracted a fair share of\r\nattention among European scholars; and the copies they had made of the\r\ninscriptions became the object of sedulous study, especially in the\r\nNorth. In Göttingen, the interest excited by the description of the\r\nruins of Persepolis gave rise to an extremely heated controversy between\r\nHeeren and Herder. The former, in an early edition of the ‘Historical\r\nResearches,’ maintained that they were of Achaemenian origin. Persepolis,\r\nhe says, ‘as the residence and place of sepulture of the Persian kings,\r\nwas considered in the light of a sanctuary, and held to be the chief\r\nplace in the kingdom.’ Herder, on the other hand, contended for its\r\nJamshid origin, and supported his opinion in a series of very acrid\r\n‘Persepolitan Letters.’[96] The question was of more importance than\r\nmight at first sight appear, for upon its decision depended the royal\r\nnames that should be looked for in the inscriptions. George Grotefend,\r\na student in the University, who made the first successful attempt\r\nto decipher them in 1802, adopted the opinion of Heeren, and his\r\ninvestigations were largely based upon the conviction that the names of\r\nDarius and Xerxes could not fail to be found hidden in the cuneiform\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the new century opened with a continuance of the explorations,\r\nand one of the most fruitful discoveries was the inscription of Cyrus\r\nfound by Morier at Murgab. For some time previous the disturbed state\r\nof the country had led to a complete suspension of diplomatic relations\r\nbetween Persia and European countries. Foreigners, who had been so\r\ncordially welcomed by Shah Abbas became almost unknown. Englishmen were\r\ngazed upon in the streets of the capital as ‘monsters of an unknown\r\ngenus,’ and thought to be Chinese.[97] At length Captain (afterwards Sir\r\nJohn) Malcolm was sent by the Indian Government to solicit an alliance\r\nfor common action against the Afghans. The French, however, viewed this\r\nfriendly alliance with jealousy, and in 1805 they sent M. Jaubert, a\r\nwell-known Orientalist, to detach the Shah from the English alliance.[98]\r\nThe French envoy was successful; a Persian mission visited France, and\r\nconcluded a treaty with Napoleon, in May 1807; an embassy under General\r\nGardanne followed. These intrigues were, however, immediately met by a\r\nspecial mission from England, headed by Sir Harford Jones; and James\r\nMorier was appointed secretary. Morier was descended from a Huguenot\r\nfamily who, after leaving France, settled first in Switzerland and\r\nafterwards in Smyrna, where they engaged in business. Here James was\r\nborn, about 1780. Not long after, his father came to England, became a\r\nnaturalised subject, and sent his sons to Harrow. A reverse of fortune\r\ncompelled him to return to Smyrna, where James again resided till about\r\n1800. His father was appointed Consul at Constantinople in 1804, and died\r\nthere of the plague in 1817. He had, however, the good fortune to secure\r\nappointments for three of his sons in the diplomatic service, and a\r\ncommission in the navy for a fourth. Morier reached Bushire at the end of\r\n1808, but upon this occasion he only spent a few months in the country.\r\nHe returned in 1810, once more filling the position of secretary to an\r\nembassy of which Sir Gore Ouseley was chief. Ouseley brought his brother\r\nWilliam with him in the capacity of private secretary and Mr. Gordon, a\r\nbrother of Lord Aberdeen, was also attached to the mission. While the\r\nparty was detained at Shiraz, in 1811, they scattered in pursuit of\r\narchæological discovery. Morier revisited Persepolis; Sir W. Ouseley went\r\nto Fasa, which was then considered to be the ancient Pasargadae; while\r\nGordon undertook the dangerous journey to Susa.[99] Morier remained in\r\nPersia for six years, devoting himself to study; and he has secured a\r\nlasting fame as author of ‘Hajji Baba.’ Upon the occasion of his first\r\nvisit in 1809, he spent only two days at Persepolis, and he added nothing\r\nto the knowledge already existing with reference to it. He, however,\r\nwent to Naksh-i-Rustam, and his friend Captain Sutherland succeeded,\r\nas Mr. Hercules had done before, in entering the tomb farthest to the\r\nleft.[100] He afterwards continued his journey along the valley of the\r\nPolvar, ‘between mountains whose brown and arid sides presented nothing\r\nto cheer or enliven the way.’ When he had travelled, as he supposed,\r\nabout forty miles, and was still some two miles from Murgab, he turned\r\nfrom the direct route to view the ruins known in the country as ‘Mesjid\r\nMadre Suleiman,’ or Tomb of the Mother of Solomon. He observed the three\r\npilasters of what is now termed the Palace of Cyrus, and conjectured at\r\nonce that they belonged to a Hall, ‘the interior of which was decorated\r\nwith columns.’ They were surmounted by a short inscription, of which he\r\nmade a copy. He next observed a ‘building of a form so extraordinary\r\nthat the people of the country often call it the court of the deevis\r\nor devil.’ He gives an excellent drawing of the well-known tomb, and\r\nadds: ‘if the position of the place had corresponded with the site of\r\nPassagardae as well as the form of this structure accords with the\r\ndescription of the Tomb of Cyrus, I should have been tempted to assign\r\nto the present building so illustrious an origin.’ He shows that the\r\nplain in which it stands was once the site of a great city, ‘as is proved\r\nby the ruins with which it is strewed’; the cuneiform inscriptions\r\nindicate that it was of the same ‘general antiquity’ as Persepolis; the\r\ntwo structures correspond in description, and in fact the only evidence\r\non the other side is the absence of the inscription which Aristobulus\r\ndeclares he saw upon it. The place had been visited twice before, once\r\nby Barbaro in the fifteenth century, and again by Mandelslo in 1638.\r\nMandelslo, indeed, gives an admirable drawing of it, which later artists\r\nhave scarcely excelled. But till it was seen by the imaginative Morier no\r\none had suggested that it was the Tomb of Cyrus. The opinion was readily\r\naccepted by Grotefend,[101] and it guided him to no small extent in the\r\ndecipherment of the name of Cyrus in the inscription brought from the\r\nimmediate vicinity.[102] When, however, Morier paid his second visit\r\nto Murgab in 1811, he was so overawed by the ponderous learning of his\r\ntravelling companion Ouseley, that he tacitly allowed the subject to\r\ndrop. On this occasion he succeeded in gaining access to the interior,\r\nbut found nothing worthy of mention. He also noticed for the first time\r\na very remarkable bas-relief of a winged human figure, and over it a\r\nrepetition of the inscription he had already copied.[103]\r\n\r\nKaempfer had set the example of collecting specimens, and we fear the\r\ngentlemen of the embassy were only too ready to follow in his steps. They\r\neven went so far as to bring stone-cutters with them, provided with the\r\nrequisite tools to carry their design into effect. We afterwards hear\r\nrather ominously of ‘the specimens in the possession of Sir Gore Ouseley\r\nand Lord Aberdeen.’[104] Morier published in 1812 the account of his\r\n‘First Journey,’ containing the famous Cyrus inscription, and in 1818 the\r\naccount of his ‘Second Journey’ followed. These works were well received,\r\nand can still be read with interest, but the fame of the author rests on\r\nhis ‘Hajji Baba,’ which appeared in 1824.\r\n\r\nOuseley, who accompanied the embassy, was a very learned Orientalist,\r\nwho was perhaps somewhat oppressed by the weight of his own\r\naccomplishments.[105] He was born in Ireland, in 1771, and after serving\r\nfor a time in the army, he retired in 1794, and devoted himself wholly\r\nto his favourite pursuits. He became a thorough Persian scholar, and the\r\nauthor of many books bearing on Persian history and antiquities. He was\r\ntherefore well qualified to accompany the embassy, and it was a source\r\nof keen pleasure to him to visit the country under such advantageous\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nWe have said that he turned aside from Shiraz to visit Fasa or Pasa,\r\nin the hope of finding the tomb of Cyrus; but, like Della Valle, he\r\ndiscovered nothing except a venerable cypress tree, which ‘is said to\r\nhave been for above one thousand years the boast and ornament of the\r\nplace.’[106] He finally came to the conclusion that Pasargadae and\r\nPersepolis were one and the same place, and firmly opposed the claim\r\nput forward by Morier on behalf of Murgab. Ouseley seems to have spent\r\nfive days in all among the ruins of Persepolis, and he made excellent\r\nuse of his time. He added another to the increasing number of general\r\nviews (Pl. 40), and contributed a few small sketches of various parts of\r\nthe building (Pl. 41). He rendered considerable service by the accurate\r\ncopy he made of the cuneiform inscription round the window frames of the\r\nPalace of Darius. He found it repeated no less than eighteen times, and\r\nby a careful collation he was able to present a complete reading of the\r\nmutilated text.[107] He finally dispelled the erroneous idea that it was\r\nto be read from the top downwards; and he pointed out that certain of the\r\ncharacters found on bricks and gems from Babylon are never to be seen at\r\nPersepolis.[108] His description of the ruins is painstaking, but the\r\nsubject was now almost exhausted. He agrees with Niebuhr that the Hall of\r\nXerxes was roofed, and also that it may have supported another stage. He\r\nwent farther and suggested the comparison with the façade of the tombs,\r\nan idea which Fergusson afterwards turned to excellent account.[109] But\r\nthe chief value of his narrative consists in the full account he gives\r\nof Murgab and the illustrations that accompany it. Mandelslo and Morier\r\nhad, as we have seen, both sketched the tomb; Ouseley adds a third sketch\r\nand by no means the best; but his other drawings are quite new, and from\r\nthem the reader gains his first impressions of the plain of Murgab. They\r\nafford excellent views of the principal remains—the terrace, the square\r\nbuilding, the palace, the caravansary, and the winged figure. He gives a\r\nsatisfactory account of each, and when he comes to the palace, we find it\r\ndescribed simply as ‘a cluster of pillars and pilasters.’ Notwithstanding\r\nall his prepossessions, he could not fail to be struck by the strange\r\nlikeness of the Murgab tomb to the description given of the tomb of\r\nCyrus, and he adds: ‘I should not have hesitated to believe it the tomb\r\nof Cyrus had the discovery of it rewarded my researches in the vicinity\r\nof Pasa or Fasa, or if, as Mr. Morier says, its position had corresponded\r\nwith the site of Passagardae.’ As it was, he even ventured to express\r\nthe opinion that it was a building of ‘doubtful antiquity.’[110] He\r\nvisited it just an hour after Morier had made his sacrilegious entry; the\r\nstartled female custodian had meanwhile returned, locked up the sacred\r\nshrine, and fled; so he was unable to satisfy his curiosity by a near\r\ninspection. He copied the Cyrus inscription from a solitary monolith\r\nto the north of the palace, and there were thus three independent\r\nversions of the same inscription taken from three different parts of the\r\nruins.[111] The copy made by Ouseley was sent to the Director of the\r\nImperial Library at St. Petersburg and through him it fell under the\r\nnotice of Grotefend. Ouseley succeeded in making a magnificent collection\r\nof Persian manuscripts, especially relating to history and geography. His\r\nlater years were spent in France, and he died at Boulogne, in 1842.[112]\r\n\r\nTwo hundred years had now elapsed since Gouvea called attention to the\r\nruins of Persepolis. A considerable amount of literature had accumulated\r\non the subject, and large numbers of plans and drawings of the principal\r\nobjects were taken, which materially assisted the student. On looking\r\nback over these, however, it was curious to observe how widely the\r\ndescriptions differed from each other, and how irreconcilable were the\r\nvarious views of the same monument. The explanation was not far to seek.\r\nMost of the travellers could only spare a few days from more pressing\r\noccupations to devote to the work. They were afterwards compelled to\r\ncomplete from memory the hasty sketches they had made on the spot, and\r\nalthough many of them display considerable skill in the use of their\r\npencil, only a few had any professional knowledge of drawing. They were,\r\nmoreover, all alike at the mercy of the engraver, and some thought\r\nthey had good reason to complain of the treatment they received at his\r\nhands. But there was another cause that led to inevitable discrepancies.\r\nFew of them aimed to produce the minute accuracy of a photograph, or\r\ncould resist the temptation of idealising the work before them: on the\r\none hand, Le Bruyn exaggerated the ruin wrought by time; on the other,\r\nNiebuhr repaired its ravages. According to the one, the sculptured\r\nstaircase is a confused mass of mutilated figures; according to the\r\nother, it appears as perfect as when first completed by the sculptor.\r\nNor was it only in the drawings that inaccuracies were to be detected.\r\nThe measuring tape itself seemed to yield different results in different\r\nhands. It was impossible to find agreement even as to the number of steps\r\nin the great staircase. According to one, there were only ninety-five\r\n(Herbert); according to another, one hundred and thirteen (Kaempfer); and\r\nother accounts ranged between these two extremes.\r\n\r\nIt was with the professed object of giving a final and authoritative\r\nrepresentation that would satisfy the curiosity of the minute student\r\nthat Sir Robert Ker Porter undertook to go over the old ground once\r\nmore. He was an accomplished artist and he consequently possessed\r\nqualifications many of his predecessors were without. He arrived at\r\nMurgab on June 12, 1818, and left Persepolis on July 1, so that he\r\nwas not more than eighteen days engaged in the study of the numerous\r\nantiquities in the neighbourhood. At the conclusion of his stay, he\r\ncongratulates himself upon finding that: ‘I had drawn nearly every\r\nbas-relief of consequence, had taken a faithful plan of the place, and\r\ncopied several of the cuneiform inscriptions.’[113] His industry during\r\nthe time must certainly have been extraordinary. He surveyed the sites\r\nof Murgab and Persepolis, and made two ground-plans of both places. The\r\nformer was now made for the first time, but the latter had been taken\r\nas early as the days of Kaempfer. He took two drawings of Murgab, four\r\nof the Achaemenian remains at Naksh-i-Rustam, six of the Sassanian\r\nsculptures, and two of the same period at Naksh-i-Rejeb. In addition to\r\nthis he made twenty-four drawings of the monuments of Persepolis—some of\r\nthem upon a large scale—and copied inscriptions that occupy four plates:\r\nthat is to say, he accomplished in eighteen days work that now fills\r\nforty-two plates of engravings. This is certainly wonderful, but if he\r\nhad executed less than one-quarter, the result would perhaps have been\r\nmore satisfactory. In addition to the drawings, he measured the various\r\nbuildings and the more important objects in each; and took notes for\r\nhis very elaborate description of the dress, the arms, and other minute\r\ndetails of the various figures in the numerous bas-reliefs. Herbert had\r\nlong ago expressed the opinion that ‘a ready Lymmer in three moneths\r\nspace can hardly (to do it well) depict out all her excellences,’ and\r\ncertainly the twelve days (from June 22 to July 1), which were all that\r\nPorter actually spent at Persepolis, were wholly inadequate for the\r\npurpose. In looking through Porter’s drawings, we find indeed ample\r\nevidence of haste, and of the absence of that minute accuracy which it\r\nwas his special object to achieve. Yet his book is still perhaps the best\r\nthat exists upon the subject in English. The drawings of his competitors\r\nare certainly not more accurate, and his careful and minute descriptions\r\nare quite unrivalled. His merit lies in the thorough investigations he\r\nmade upon the ground itself, in the painstaking and, upon the whole,\r\naccurate measurements he took of each monument, and in the clear and\r\nexplanatory account he has given of the various subjects depicted on\r\nthe bas-reliefs. The care with which his investigations were made was\r\nrewarded by the discovery of the remains of the second edifice at\r\nMurgab, which had escaped the notice of Morier and Ouseley. His visit\r\nto Naksh-i-Rustam resulted in the earliest drawings we possess upon an\r\nadequate scale of the façade of a tomb, and it was completed by a ground\r\nplan of the interior.[114] He expressed his conviction that the third\r\ntomb with the long cuneiform inscription was in all probability that\r\nof Darius, an opinion afterwards proved to be correct.[115] The long\r\ndebate as to the nature of the enigmatical animals on the Great Porch at\r\nPersepolis was still undecided. Even Mr. Morier adhered to the notion\r\nthat they were horses, but Porter’s keen eye at once identified them with\r\nthe bull, which subsequent discoveries at Nineveh has confirmed.[116]\r\nHe also showed that the capital of the columns was composed of two half\r\nbulls, but he does not seem to have recorded that they are elsewhere\r\nvaried by half griffins.[117]\r\n\r\nPorter had no doubt that the Takht-i-Jamshid represented the ruins of the\r\npalaces of Persepolis, although the subject had not yet passed beyond\r\nthe region of controversy. He inclines, however, to the compromise\r\nfavoured by Niebuhr, and dwells upon the pontifical character of the\r\nsovereign, especially after the death of Zoroaster, when, he says, Darius\r\nassumed the title of Archimagus. He accepted Morier’s suggestion that\r\nMurgab was the site of Pasargadae and its principal monument the tomb of\r\nCyrus.[118] He had a thorough belief in the decipherment of Grotefend.\r\nHe not only accepted his recognition of the names of Darius and Xerxes,\r\nbut he followed him when he traced their descent from Jamshid. That\r\nhero was, he thought, none other than Shem, whom sacred writ planted\r\nin that very region of Persia, and possibly Persepolis bore his name\r\nfrom the very earliest ages.[119] Porter did not himself advance our\r\nknowledge of the inscriptions. He copied the inscription at Murgab, but\r\nthat had been previously done by Morier and Ouseley, and, as he candidly\r\nremarks, he ‘found that we all differed in some of the lines from each\r\nother.’[120] He also copied a portion of the inscription (A) on the\r\nsculptured staircase, of which Niebuhr had already given a satisfactory\r\nrendering;[121] and finally he took the trouble to execute an extremely\r\nimperfect copy of the four tablets of inscriptions on the south wall,\r\nwhich had also been much better done by Niebuhr.[122]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding its many defects, his book continued for thirty years\r\nto be the chief authority on the subject.[123] Heeren popularised the\r\ngeneral result in the fourth edition of his ‘Researches’ (1824), and it\r\nthus became equally well known to German readers. Texier complained, in\r\n1842, that there was absolutely no book in French upon the subject, and\r\nhe had to refer to Porter for his information.[124] It was not till after\r\nthe publication of the elaborate works of Texier and Flandin, which did\r\nnot appear till 1849-51, that Porter was in any way superseded. Even then\r\nthe form in which the great French authorities are published has rendered\r\nthem inaccessible except to students in a great public library. The\r\ngeneral reader would have remained in complete ignorance of the results\r\nbut for the opportune publication, in 1851, of Fergusson on the ‘Palaces\r\nof Persepolis,’ and Vaux on ‘Nineveh and Persepolis.’\r\n\r\nWithin this long period, the area of discovery widened. Hamadan was\r\nidentified with Ecbatana by D’Anville and Rennell, and it soon became\r\nan object of curiosity. The city stands 6,000 feet above the level of\r\nthe sea, in a plain at the foot of Mount Elvend (the Orontes), and is\r\nsurrounded by vineyards, orchards and gardens. Morier visited it in 1813,\r\nand discovered in the outskirts of the city a base of a small column\r\nof the identical order found at Persepolis, and near it he observed a\r\nlarge irregular terrace, perhaps the foundation of the Palace. Rawlinson\r\nafterwards detected five or six other bases of the same type. Three years\r\nbefore Morier’s visit, Kinneir had observed an inscription some seven\r\nmiles distant, carved on the surface of the rock on a steep declivity\r\nof Mount Elvend.[125] ‘It consists,’ says Morier, ‘of two tablets,\r\neach divided into three longitudinal compartments, inscribed with the\r\narrow-headed character of Persepolis. These inscriptions are called by\r\nthe Persians Genj-nameh, or “Tales of a Treasure.”’[126] When Porter\r\npassed through Hamadan, he also went in search of the mysterious stone\r\nwhich he heard bore unintelligible writing. After a fruitless ascent of\r\none of the highest peaks of Mount Elvend, he was fortunate enough in\r\nthe course of his descent to come across the object of his expedition.\r\nThe stone, he says, consists of ‘an immense block of red granite of\r\nfine texture,’ and the inscription is in excellent preservation. The\r\nnatives believe that whoever succeeds in deciphering it will find a key\r\nthat will enable him to discover a large treasure in the mountain, and\r\nhence the name they give it. Porter only reached it when the day was\r\nfar advanced, and he had not time to make a copy.[127] Bellino, of whom\r\nwe shall hear later, made another attempt, in 1820, but unfortunately\r\nhe was attacked by fever at Hamadan, and died without accomplishing his\r\nobject.[128] At length Mr. Stewart and M. Vidal, the consular dragoman at\r\nAleppo, obtained copies about 1827, and communicated them to M. Schulz,\r\nwho was then at Van. Professor Schulz of Hesse had been commissioned by\r\nthe French Foreign Minister to undertake a scientific journey to the\r\nEast, and he reached Van in July 1827, where he made copies of no less\r\nthan forty-two cuneiform inscriptions. Long afterwards they were found\r\nto be written chiefly in the old Armenian language; but one was in the\r\nthree varieties adopted by the Achaemenian kings. It was engraved on\r\na large square tablet escarped on the precipitous face of the rock\r\nabout sixty feet above the ground. It was divided into three columns,\r\neach column consisting of twenty-seven lines. Unfortunately, Schulz was\r\nmurdered in 1829, and his papers ultimately found their way into the\r\nhands of M. Lajard of Paris, by whom they were sent to M. St. Martin for\r\npublication.[129] St. Martin, as we shall see, had early busied himself\r\nwith cuneiform inscriptions, but in consequence of his early death, the\r\npapers of Schulz fell into the possession of the very eminent Orientalist\r\nBurnouf, by whom they were used with singular ability. The inscriptions\r\nfound at Mount Elvend and at Van[130] became the subject of his ‘Mémoire\r\nsur deux Inscriptions,’ which appeared in 1836, and which marked the\r\nfirst great advance in cuneiform decipherment that had taken place since\r\nthe memorable effort of Grotefend thirty-four years before.\r\n\r\nTill the publication of Burnouf’s essay in 1836, the task of decipherment\r\nhad made but small progress, and so far as we are aware, no copy of a\r\nPersian inscription had yet been published that had been taken by anyone\r\nwith the smallest knowledge of the meaning of the characters. Mr. Rich,\r\nthe British Resident at Bagdad, was, however, a zealous student of\r\nGrotefend, and in constant correspondence with him. He kept him supplied\r\nwith copies of the few inscriptions that were then brought to light from\r\nthe ruined mounds of Mosul and Hillah. His German secretary Bellino, who\r\nwas also much interested in cuneiform discoveries, generally acted as\r\nthe medium of communication; and Grotefend’s later pamphlets are full\r\nof recognition of the services he had received from both scholars. Rich\r\nwas a man of very unusual attainments.[131] When still quite a boy,\r\nhe mastered several Oriental languages, and in later years, amid the\r\npressure of official life he never lost his interest in these subjects.\r\nHe collected large numbers of Oriental manuscripts, and his mind was\r\nfilled with the lore they contained. His house at Bagdad became the\r\nrendezvous of all the more eminent travellers who passed that way in\r\nthe early years of the century. His hospitality acquired a reputation\r\nnot inferior to that of Père Raphael at Ispahan during the latter half\r\nof the sixteenth century. Rich was equally ready to place his vast\r\nstores of Oriental knowledge at the disposal of his guests, and his\r\nofficial position enabled him to afford them substantial assistance.\r\nIt was peculiarly fortunate that so eminent a man should have held\r\nthat office at a time when public interest was first awakened to the\r\narchæology of the ancient cities of the East. He was himself able to\r\nrender important services in this field of inquiry, and he made a\r\ncollection of antiquities, afterwards acquired by the British Museum,\r\nwhich, though limited, as it is said, to a single small case, was still\r\nunequalled then in Europe, and was the beginning of the vast collection\r\nthat now fills the Babylonian and Assyrian rooms. In the summer of\r\n1821, he found himself at Bushire on official business, and well-nigh\r\noverpowered by the excessive heat. He accordingly decided to make a short\r\ntrip to Shiraz, where a friend, who had just returned, gave him the\r\nrefreshing intelligence that ‘the climate even then, in July, was so cold\r\nthat one was obliged to put on a fur jacket and actually suffered from\r\ncold.’[132] Mr. Rich had, however, no cause to complain of the cold. The\r\nusual temperature, he found, was 90° at the hottest time, but it fell\r\nduring the nights to 71°, which he considered ‘deliciously cool without\r\nbeing chilly.’[133] It was impossible for him to be so near Persepolis\r\nwithout gratifying his curiosity. ‘My expectation,’ he says, ‘was\r\ngreatly excited. Chardin, when I was a mere child, had inspired me with\r\na great desire to see these ruins.’ He was, however, merely travelling\r\nfor health; and he had no intention of undertaking the onerous duties\r\nof an itinerant antiquarian. There was indeed no longer any necessity.\r\n‘The ruins have been so accurately described, measured, and delineated\r\nby our friend Porter that nothing remains to be done; and I can abandon\r\nmyself entirely to the luxury of imagination, of which the line, compass\r\nand pencil, and the intolerable labour they bring on, are eminently\r\ndestructive.’[134]\r\n\r\nOn August 17, 1821, he enjoyed the first view of the ruins from his\r\nresting place, a mile distant, and with unusual philosophy he repressed\r\nhis curiosity and continued his march to Murgab. ‘I took,’ he writes,\r\n‘a capricious kind of pleasure in not going to them, and forcing myself\r\nto be contented with this general survey.’ He passed the little nook of\r\nNaksh-i-Rejeb and the ruins of Istakhr, and at length encamped before\r\nthe ‘Meshed i Mader i Suliman.’ It will be recollected that the learning\r\nof Ouseley had decisively negatived the sagacious intuition of the more\r\nbrilliant Morier, and the subsequent discovery of the name of Cyrus on\r\nthe inscriptions at Murgab was as yet far from being accepted as decisive\r\nof the matter. The true site of the tomb of Cyrus was therefore still in\r\ndispute, and Rich could only venture to write that he ‘began to think\r\nthat this in reality must be the tomb.’[135] He hoped, however, to be\r\nable to contribute something to the settlement of the question, but when\r\nhe left he confessed, after all, that he was still unconvinced.[136]\r\nHe, however, made another copy of the now celebrated inscription. After\r\na stay of only one day, Rich retraced his steps towards Persepolis, and\r\npitched his tent on the top of the great staircase, beneath the shadow of\r\nthe Entrance Porch.\r\n\r\nHis resolution to abstain from antiquarian labour entirely broke down\r\nin presence of the inscriptions. He employed workmen to clear away the\r\nrubbish which in some places concealed them, and he disclosed for the\r\nfirst time the inscription on the south stairs leading to the Palace of\r\nDarius,[137] and the one opposite on the façade of the stairs of the\r\nPalace of Ochus. ‘I was actually diligent enough,’ he writes, ‘to fall to\r\nwork at copying the inscriptions; and during the six days we remained at\r\nPersepolis I copied all the inscriptions except one. I have found much to\r\ncorroborate Grotefend’s system, and have admired his sagacity. The labour\r\nI have gone through will greatly assist him.’[138] Indeed the result of\r\nhis industry, combined with that of his predecessors, was to leave little\r\nmore to be done by the copyist at Persepolis. The inscriptions over the\r\nanimals on the Porch, and the long inscription at Naksh-i-Rustam seem\r\nindeed to be the only ones that remained.\r\n\r\n1. He copied the three tablets of inscriptions of Xerxes on the Anta of\r\nthe Palace of Darius, which had been imperfectly done by Le Bruyn (Table\r\n131).[139]\r\n\r\n2. The three tablets of inscriptions of Xerxes on the Anta in his\r\npalace—now first taken.[140]\r\n\r\n3. The three tables of inscriptions of Xerxes, consisting of four lines\r\nover the king’s head on the east portal of his palace.[141] This is the\r\nsame inscription as Niebuhr had copied from the north portal (his E, F,\r\nG).\r\n\r\n4. Fragmentary inscriptions of Xerxes found in his palace.[142]\r\n\r\n5. The three inscriptions of Xerxes on the south stairs of the Palace of\r\nDarius[143]—now first taken.\r\n\r\n6. The central inscription of Artaxerxes Ochus on stairs to Palace of\r\nOchus[144]—now first taken.\r\n\r\n7. His Seyid copied the three tablets of the inscription of Xerxes over\r\nthe colossal animals on the east walls of the Porch.[145] Mr. Rich was\r\nunfortunately unable on account of giddiness to remain at a height; and\r\non this account he deputed the task to his Seyid, who had some experience\r\nof the cuneiform letters found at Babylon. This inscription was now first\r\ntaken, but the copy turned out to be practically useless; and the first\r\nadequate rendering was made by Westergaard.\r\n\r\nComing from Babylon, where all the inscriptions he had seen were\r\nunilingual, he was much struck by the repetition of each inscription at\r\nPersepolis in three distinct modes of writing. ‘Every inscription in\r\nPersepolis,’ he says, ‘even the bits on the robes of the king, are in the\r\nthree kinds. When an inscription is round a door or window, the first\r\nspecies is on the top, the second on the left hand running up, the third\r\non the right, running down. I speak as looking at the door.’ ‘If one\r\nunder the other, the first (or Zend) is always in the upper tablet; if\r\nside by side over a figure, it is the one over the head of the king; if\r\non his robes, it is on the front fold; if on the face of a platform, it\r\nis in the centre, with the figures on each side facing towards it.’ ‘The\r\nother two species always preserve their order: the third (or Babylonian)\r\nin the place of least consideration.’[146] He called special attention to\r\nthe inscriptions upon the tomb at Naksh-i-Rustam. ‘They are,’ he said,\r\n‘the longest of all the cuneiform inscriptions I have ever seen. In\r\nfact, there is a prodigious quantity of writing upon them, but so small\r\nand so high up and so much worn that I should think it impossible to\r\ncopy them.’[147] He was neither surprised nor disappointed by his visit,\r\nbut the impression left was not one of unmixed admiration. The general\r\nview presented by the ruins he declared to be grand; the colonnade to\r\nbe fine, and the execution and finish very beautiful; but he thought\r\nthe portals at the landing place were much too narrow, all the doors\r\ntoo narrow and the windows too small, yet ‘formed of blocks that would\r\nbuild a mole.’ There is no correspondence between the object and the\r\nmeans, which gives to many parts of these remains, at least as they now\r\nappear, rather a heavy, crowded and crushed effect, ‘proceeding from the\r\ndisproportionate application of vast materials, which is, after all, a\r\nfoolish ambition.’[148]\r\n\r\nShortly after leaving Persepolis, he was struck down by cholera, and\r\nhis death at the early age of thirty-five removed a man exceptionally\r\nqualified to render important service to his country and to learning. It\r\nhad been his intention to send his valuable copies of the inscriptions to\r\nGrotefend, who was probably less qualified than Rich imagined to make a\r\nsatisfactory use of them. As it was, they were not published till 1839,\r\nwhen the progress of cuneiform studies had deprived them of much of\r\ntheir importance.\r\n\r\nSoon after the publication of Rich’s book, in 1839, the Danish scholar\r\nWestergaard visited Persepolis, and completed the transcription of the\r\nwhole of the inscriptions. He was, as we shall see, fully qualified\r\nfor the task by his technical knowledge of the subject. Only two new\r\ninscriptions, however, remained for him to copy: the one on the Porch\r\nthat Rich was unable to reach (Inscr. D), and the great inscription on\r\nthe tomb at Naksh-i-Rustam, which proved it to have been the sepulchre of\r\nDarius (Inscr. NR).\r\n\r\nOnly one Persian inscription of first-rate importance now remained to\r\nreward the zeal of the copyist. This was the famous one engraved in an\r\nalmost inaccessible position upon the rock of Behistun. It is situated on\r\nthe road from Hamadan to Kermanshah, about twenty miles before reaching\r\nthe latter place. The rock forms an abrupt termination to a long range\r\nof barren hills, and presents a most remarkable appearance, rising in\r\nperpendicular form to the height of 1,700 feet. As it lies on the direct\r\nroute to Media by the Holwan Pass, it was well known from the earliest\r\ntimes. According to Greek legend the hill was dedicated to Zeus; and\r\nSemiramis, on the occasion of an expedition against the Medes, caused\r\na portion of the face of the rock to be polished and her own effigy to\r\nbe carved upon it, surrounded by a hundred of her guards. She added\r\nan inscription in Assyrian characters, commemorating her triumphant\r\nmarch.[149] Whether any inscription of the kind ever existed is doubtful,\r\nbut if so, all traces of it have disappeared. The inscription that has\r\nbeen recovered appears to have been executed in the fifth or sixth year\r\nof the reign of Darius; and it gives a lengthy record of the suppression\r\nof the revolts with which his reign opened. It occupies a surface of\r\nabout 150 feet in length by 100 feet in height.[150] The tablets rest\r\nupon a narrow ledge of the rock, 300 feet from the ground, and the\r\nengraver could only have executed his task from a scaffolding erected for\r\nthe purpose. Major Rawlinson tells us that the mere preparation of the\r\nsurface of the rock must have occupied months. Where a flaw occurred,\r\na piece was inlaid by embedding it in molten lead, and this tedious\r\nwork was so carefully executed that it can only be detected by close\r\nscrutiny. After the letters were engraved, the whole received a coat\r\nof silicious varnish, in order to impart clearness of outline and to\r\nprotect the surface against the action of the weather. ‘The varnish,’\r\nhe says, ‘is of infinitely greater hardness than the limestone beneath\r\nit.’[151] Notwithstanding all this elaborate preparation, many fissures\r\nhave been made in the rock by the percolation of water, and the writing\r\nis defaced in many places. The inscriptions are grouped round a central\r\ntablet decorated with sculpture. The principal figure is Darius the\r\nKing. He has one foot placed on the prostrate form of a vanquished foe;\r\nbehind him are two attendants, and in front stand nine captives chained\r\ntogether. The last of the series is evidently a later addition made after\r\nthe original work was accomplished; and he is distinguished from the\r\nrest by the peculiarity of his pointed cap. Close to each figure is a\r\nshort inscription, giving the name and a relation of the evil deeds of\r\nthe individual; by which means they are identified with the leaders of\r\nthe rebellion. The prostrate form is no less a personage than Gaumates,\r\nthe Magian. Above is the winged figure which is now known to be a\r\nrepresentation of Ormuzd himself.[152] Rawlinson considers the execution\r\nof the figures as inferior to that of the bas-reliefs at Persepolis.\r\n‘The effigies of Darius and his attendants alone exhibit that grace\r\nof outline and studied finish of detail which may place them at all\r\nupon an equality with the Persepolitan sculptures.’ The figure of the\r\nKing is six feet in height, but the others are of diminutive stature,\r\ndesigned no doubt to mark their inferiority of position.[153] The artist\r\nseems to have even taken the trouble to represent them as repulsive in\r\nappearance. This part of the work is covered by no less than thirty-three\r\nshort inscriptions—eleven in Persian, twelve in Median or, as it is now\r\ncalled, Susian, and ten in Babylonian. To the left of the sculptured\r\ntablet, and upon the same level, in a position exceptionally difficult\r\nof access, are two large tablets in the Babylonian style. To the right\r\nare four tablets—two in Susian and two in Babylonian—which were added\r\nlater, and refer to the events connected with the figure with the pointed\r\ncap. This portion is so much defaced that it is difficult to do more\r\nthan conjecture its meaning. It seems, however, to relate to a revolt in\r\nSusiana which, according to M. Oppert, occurred before the twelfth year\r\nof the reign of Darius.[154] Its chief was captured and hanged upon a\r\ncross. The main body of the inscription lies below the sculptured tablet.\r\nImmediately beneath it are four columns in Persian, each twelve feet\r\nhigh, and containing ninety-six lines of cuneiform writing; and a fifth,\r\nhalf that length, relating to the events of the more recent rebellion.\r\nTo the left, below the large Babylonian inscription, are three columns in\r\nSusian. It is calculated that the whole contains nearly a thousand lines\r\nof cuneiform writing, of which no less than 416 are in Persian. It is\r\nsaid to comprise ten times as many words as all the rest of the shorter\r\ntexts put together.[155]\r\n\r\nThe French traveller Otter seems to have been the first to call attention\r\nto Behistun, about the year 1734, and it is also noticed in the travels\r\nof Olivier.[156] Kinneir passed it in 1810, and he describes ‘a group of\r\nfigures in the form of a procession sufficiently perfect to show that\r\nthey are of the same age and character as those of Persepolis.’[157]\r\nIn 1818, Porter at length succeeded in getting sufficiently near to\r\nsketch the figures.[158] He confirms Kinneir’s conjecture as to their\r\nresemblance to those at Persepolis; and he recognises the winged figure\r\nas ‘the floating intelligence in his circle and car of sunbeams, so often\r\nremarked on the sculptures of Naksh-i-Rustam and Persepolis.’ He remarked\r\nthat there was a cuneiform inscription above the head of each figure and\r\nbelow ‘eight deep and closely written columns in the same character.’\r\nNotwithstanding the facility Porter had already acquired in copying\r\ninscriptions at Persepolis, he was at too great a distance from these to\r\nmake the attempt. He calculated it would require a month to complete the\r\ntask, and adds that ‘at no time can it ever be attempted without great\r\npersonal risk.’\r\n\r\nThe extremely inaccessible position of the inscriptions long baffled\r\nthe zeal of explorers. M. Flandin, as we shall see, though specially\r\ncommissioned by the French Government to examine Persian antiquities,\r\nretreated in dismay from the perilous task, which was left as usual to\r\nthe private enterprise of an Englishman to accomplish. So long indeed\r\nas the history of cuneiform decipherment is remembered, the name of\r\nHenry Creswicke Rawlinson will continue to be associated with Behistun.\r\nHe was not only the first to surmount the very considerable physical\r\ndifficulties of approaching the inscriptions, but he succeeded, while in\r\na position that was highly inconvenient, if not positively dangerous, in\r\nmaking so accurate a copy that few errors or omissions of importance were\r\nafterwards detected. The first copy appears to have been made entirely\r\nwith the pen—the process of taking paper casts being employed on a later\r\noccasion—and it was a task that called for the display of extraordinary\r\npatience and most scrupulous care. He had to transcribe, or more\r\nproperly to draw, vast numbers of signs of multitudinous and fantastic\r\nshapes, without at that time having the smallest clue to their meaning—a\r\nknowledge that would have served to check the accuracy of his work as\r\nhe went along. Soon afterwards indeed he became the most skilful of\r\ndecipherers. He cannot indeed claim to have been the first to solve the\r\ndifficulties of the Persian alphabet; but his translation of the Behistun\r\ninscription was by far the greatest contribution ever made to a knowledge\r\nof that language; and he rendered scarcely less remarkable service in\r\nunravelling the mysteries of the third, or Babylonian, column.\r\n\r\nRawlinson was born at Chadlington Park, Oxfordshire, in 1810.[159] His\r\nfamily was recognised for centuries among the principal country gentry\r\nof Lancashire; but his father sold his ancestral estate and settled in\r\nOxfordshire. He enjoyed the supreme distinction of winning the Derby in\r\n1841 with Coronation, an achievement that no doubt afforded him scarcely\r\nless pleasure than the triumphs of his two illustrious sons, Henry and\r\nGeorge.\r\n\r\nHenry was the seventh child of a family of eleven. He was educated at\r\nEaling School, which at that time enjoyed a great reputation, and had\r\nrecently numbered the two Newmans among its pupils. Here he acquired a\r\nsound knowledge of the classical languages, so that in after life he\r\ncould master the contents of almost any Latin or Greek prose author\r\nwith facility. Indeed when he left he was first in Greek and second in\r\nLatin of the whole school. He grew to be six feet high, broad-chested,\r\nstrong limbed, with steady head and nerve. He was fond of field sports,\r\na taste which he had every opportunity of indulging at Chadlington and\r\nwhich he retained throughout the whole of his busy life. At sixteen\r\nhe obtained a nomination to the Indian Service, and after six months\r\nspent in the study of Oriental languages under a private tutor at\r\nBlackheath, he sailed for India, where he arrived in October 1827. He\r\nhad the good fortune to go out in the same ship with Sir John Malcolm,\r\nwho had just been appointed Governor of Bombay. He devoted himself to\r\nthe acquisition of the native languages and Persian, and also to various\r\nstudies, particularly that of history. On the voyage out he edited the\r\npaper that was started for the amusement of the passengers, and this\r\nearly connection with the press he afterwards continued, so that at the\r\nage of nineteen we find him contributing articles and short poems to\r\nthe Bombay newspapers. But he never forgot that he was a soldier, and\r\nthat it was no less part of his duty to cultivate physical activity.\r\nHe accordingly passed much time in hunting and shooting, and in various\r\nathletic games, and one of his great achievements was an extraordinary\r\nride that might now incur the humanitarian censure of a less strenuous\r\nage. In 1833, when still a lieutenant, he was one of eight officers\r\nselected to proceed to Persia to assist in training the army of the Shah.\r\nThey landed at Bushire, where they were delayed for some months by the\r\nheavy snow on the mountains between that port and Shiraz. Rawlinson’s\r\ninterest in archæological subjects was already awakened, and he took the\r\nfirst opportunity of visiting Shapoor and Persepolis, and making numerous\r\nsketches of both places. He was stationed at Tabriz during the summer of\r\n1834, and with characteristic energy he endeavoured to reach the top of\r\nMount Ararat, but he was prevented by the great depth of snow. In the\r\nfollowing spring (1835) he was nominated by the Shah to act as Military\r\nAdviser to the King’s brother, who was Governor of Kurdistan and resided\r\nat Kermanshah. On his way he visited Hamadan, and copied the cuneiform\r\ninscription at Mount Elvend (April 1835). At Kermanshah he was within\r\ntwenty miles of Behistun, which, as his biographer observes, ‘has been\r\nin the Providence of God the great means by which the ancient Persian,\r\nAssyrian, and Babylonian languages have been recovered, and a chapter of\r\nthe world’s history that had been almost wholly lost once more made known\r\nto mankind.’ He passed his leisure time during 1835-37 in transcribing\r\nas much of the inscriptions as he could reach, and in the endeavour to\r\nfathom their meaning. Sometimes he ascended and descended the slippery\r\nrock three or four times a day ‘without the aid of rope or ladder or any\r\nassistance whatever.’ The difficulties are, he modestly says, ‘such\r\nas any person with ordinary nerves may successfully encounter.’[160]\r\nTowards the close of the year 1835, he paid a short visit to Bagdad, to\r\nplace himself under the care of Dr. Ross; and he there became acquainted\r\nwith Colonel Taylor, whom he was afterwards destined to succeed as\r\nBritish Resident. In the early spring, he led a native force of three\r\nthousand men through the mountains of Luristan, and took the opportunity\r\nof visiting Dizful, Suza, and Shuster. By that time his interest was\r\nfully aroused in cuneiform studies, and he no doubt heard from Colonel\r\nTaylor of the efforts that had been made in Europe to interpret the\r\ninscriptions. The vagueness of his information upon the subject is\r\nevident from the prominence he accords to the abortive speculations of\r\nSt. Martin. We find him, in March 1836, lamenting over the destruction of\r\nthe famous black stone of Susa, for he had hoped by its means to ‘verify\r\nor disprove the attempts which have been made by St. Martin and others\r\nto decipher the arrow-head characters.’[161] His mind was also occupied\r\nwith geographical subjects, in which he afterwards attained to great\r\ndistinction. He wrote to his brother for particulars of the expedition\r\nof Heraclius, and thought he had solved the mystery of the two rivers at\r\nSusa, which was probably the same as that afterwards announced by Mr.\r\nLoftus. He began to look forward to his three years’ leave of absence,\r\nwhich he hoped to spend in ‘a nice cheap lodging’ at Oxford or Cambridge\r\n‘for the sake of consulting the classical and Oriental works which are\r\nthere alone procurable.’ Meanwhile he had ordered out books from England,\r\nand for the present he found life tolerable enough. ‘I am,’ he says, ‘in\r\na country abounding with game and antiquities, so that with my gun in\r\nhand I perambulate the vicinity of Shuster, and fill at the same time my\r\nbag with partridges and my pocket-book with memoranda.’ It was not till\r\nthe autumn of that year (1836), during a short visit to Teheran, that he\r\nbecame acquainted with the alphabets of Grotefend and St. Martin, and\r\nlearned the progress that had been made by them in Germany and France.\r\n\r\nHe returned to his post at Kermanshah for the winter of 1836-7, and once\r\nmore directed his attention to the inscriptions at Behistun. During all\r\nthis period he continued to be practically the governor of the extensive\r\nprovince of Kermanshah and the commander of a large portion of the army\r\nstationed in it. In the summer of 1837, he was relieved of these duties,\r\nand received a mark of the Shah’s favour by being appointed Custodian of\r\nthe Arsenal of Teheran. He passed that winter (1837-8) in the capital,\r\nand when the British Envoy, Sir J. McNeill, accompanied the army of the\r\nShah to Herat, he found himself left in ‘quasi political charge.’ Soon\r\nafterwards, the progress of political events led to the withdrawal of the\r\nMission from Persia, and Rawlinson found himself at Bagdad towards the\r\nclose of the year 1838, where he remained till October 1839.\r\n\r\nWhile at Kermanshah (1835-7) he was able to make a nearly correct\r\ntranscript of the entire first column of the Persian text, together\r\nwith the opening paragraph of the second, ten paragraphs of the third\r\ncolumn and four of the detached inscriptions, amounting altogether to two\r\nhundred lines, or one half of the whole inscription.[162]\r\n\r\nThe outbreak of the Afghan war, in 1839, summoned him to a very\r\ndifferent sphere of activity. He was recalled to Bombay in October of\r\nthat year, and in January 1840, he was ordered to Candahar, where he\r\nfilled the important office of Political Agent throughout the whole of\r\nthat trying period. It was due in a measure to his energy and prudence,\r\nacting in combination with the military talent of General Nott, that\r\nthe town was saved, and a portion of the disaster at Kabul retrieved.\r\nThe evacuation of Candahar took place in August 1842, and by the end\r\nof the year Rawlinson was back in India. He had been present at three\r\nbattles and on each occasion was honourably mentioned in despatches; in\r\naddition to these services, he accompanied the General as aide-de-camp\r\nduring the hard fighting on the march to Cabul and the Sutlej. An\r\naccidental meeting on board a steamer with Lord Ellenborough, who was\r\nthen the Governor-General, ripened into friendship, and procured for the\r\nyoung officer an offer of the ‘Residency in Nepaul’ or of ‘the Central\r\nIndia Agency’; but these were declined. Rawlinson had set his heart\r\non completing his cuneiform studies, which had now been suspended by\r\nthree years of adventure; and although these appointments were of much\r\ngreater dignity and emolument, he eagerly seized upon the opportunity of\r\nreturning to Bagdad as ‘Political Agent in Turkish Arabia,’ in succession\r\nto Colonel Taylor. Here he arrived in December, 1843, to ‘work out the\r\nBabylonian puzzle’ and to spend ‘twelve weary years of his life doing\r\npenance in order to attain a great literary object.’[163]\r\n\r\nAs soon as he could spare time, in the early summer of 1844, he returned\r\nto Behistun, accompanied by Mr. Hester and Captain Jones, R. N.[164]\r\nIt will be remembered that up to that time he had only secured two\r\nhundred lines of the Persian column, or about one half of the whole.\r\nA week of continuous work now enabled him to transcribe the whole of\r\nthe Persian, the whole of the Susian, and the whole of the detached\r\nBabylonian epigraphs. The Babylonian version of the Great Inscription was\r\nstill found to be inaccessible without more elaborate appliances, and it\r\nwas abandoned for the present. He spent the year 1845 in completing a\r\nMemoir on the subject, which he had begun to prepare in 1839, before the\r\noutbreak of the war. The new materials he had just collected rendered\r\nit advisable to rewrite the whole work, though the translation he had\r\nattempted of the earlier portion remained substantially unaltered.\r\nThis task involved transcribing four hundred lines of cuneiform, which\r\nwas a work of no ordinary labour in that climate and among many other\r\nconflicting claims upon his time. He began as soon as possible to\r\ntransmit instalments of his Memoir to England; and in May 1846 we learn\r\nby the Report of the Asiatic Society that ‘the extraordinary discoveries\r\nof Major Rawlinson are now passing through the press and will be shortly\r\npublished.’\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the great discoveries of Botha and Layard had transferred the\r\ninterest of scholars from the Persian to the Babylonian column, for the\r\nlatter was seen to bear a close analogy to the inscriptions coming to\r\nlight with such startling rapidity on the banks of the Tigris. It was\r\nevident that the possession of the long inscription at Behistun would\r\ngreatly increase the knowledge of this language; it covered no less than\r\na hundred and ten lines, and the Persian version, which was by this\r\ntime practically understood, would materially assist the translation.\r\nAccordingly, in September 1847, Rawlinson returned to Behistun with\r\nladders, planks, ropes, and various other contrivances. But his chief\r\ndependence was upon a wild Kurdish boy, who squeezed himself up a cleft\r\nin the rock and drove in a wooden peg. To this he fastened a rope, and\r\nendeavoured to swing himself across the inscription to a cleft on the\r\nother side. This he failed to accomplish on account of the projection\r\nof the rock. ‘It then only remained for him to cross over to the cleft\r\nby hanging on with his toes and fingers to the slight inequalities on\r\nthe bare face of the precipice; and in this he succeeded, passing over a\r\ndistance of twenty feet of almost smooth perpendicular rock in a manner\r\nwhich to a looker-on appeared quite miraculous.’[165] He then drove a\r\nsecond peg, and the rope connecting the two enabled him to swing right\r\nacross. To it he attached a ladder like a painter’s cradle, and then,\r\nunder Rawlinson’s direction, he took paper casts of the whole Babylonian\r\ntext. The work occupied ten days, but unfortunately the inscription\r\nwas found to be sadly mutilated. ‘The left half, or perhaps a larger\r\nportion even, of the tablet is entirely destroyed, and we have thus the\r\nmere endings of the lines throughout the entire length of the whole\r\ninscription.’[166] On his return to Bagdad, he applied himself to the\r\ndifficult task of deciphering and translating his new acquisition. In\r\nthis investigation he could as yet derive no assistance from other\r\nscholars. Those who were beginning to study Assyrian in Europe, of whom\r\nDr. Hincks and M. de Saulcy were the most notable, had not as yet made\r\nfarther progress than himself. He devoted the whole of 1848 and part of\r\n1849 to this laborious pursuit, and at the same time added Hebrew to\r\nthe number of his accomplishments. His ‘Second Memoir’ was, however,\r\ncompleted in time to despatch to London in 1849, and he prepared to\r\nreturn himself in order to superintend its publication. The ‘Memoir\r\non the Babylonian Translation of the Great Inscription at Behistun’\r\nfinally appeared in the fourteenth volume of the ‘Journal of the Asiatic\r\nSociety,’ 1851.\r\n\r\nRawlinson had made the rock of Behistun his own; and although many\r\ncomplaints were heard of the delay that occurred before he could give\r\nthe results to the world, no one attempted to undergo the dangers he\r\nhad faced in order to dispute his title to possession. It is to him,\r\ntherefore, that we owe the recovery of this Memorial of Darius. It\r\nafforded a few not very important additions to history, and it was\r\nvaluable by confirming the veracity and accuracy of Herodotus, which some\r\nwriters were still disposed to impeach. But its chief importance lay in\r\nthe length of the text, which for the first time presented sufficient\r\nmaterials to enable the student to acquire a competent knowledge of the\r\nold Persian language. Once in possession of this key, he could apply it\r\nto the solution of the more difficult problems afforded by the other two\r\ncolumns, and in this manner three ancient and forgotten languages were\r\nrestored to knowledge.\r\n\r\nWe have now come to the time when the enterprise of individual travellers\r\nwas about to be superseded by commissioners sent by foreign Governments\r\nto collect information in an official capacity. We cannot say that the\r\ngeneral reader has cause to be thankful. We now part company with the\r\nmodest volume that could be purchased and handled with comparative ease.\r\nIn its place we have massive folios, which an enterprising student may\r\nindeed find in the ‘large room’ of the British Museum, but which are\r\nbeyond the power of a private library to acquire. No one untainted by\r\nAfrican gold could contemplate their possession, and indeed it would\r\nbe necessary to build an addition to an ordinary house to find them\r\naccommodation. They are not adapted for study, for they tax too severely\r\nthe physical endurance of the reader. The writer who is employed to fill\r\nin the blanks between the magnificent illustrations, is probably sensible\r\nof this, and one of them, M. Flandin, afterwards republished his text in\r\na more convenient form. These vast folios are designed, we should think,\r\nmainly for the glorification of the Government who has paid for them,\r\nand for the benefit of the various mechanical persons employed in their\r\nfabrication. Sumptuously bound in red morocco, with richly gilt edges,\r\nthey serve only to be rolled into the room of a palace in order that the\r\npretty pictures that adorn them may be idly scanned amid the chatter of a\r\ntea-table.\r\n\r\nThe first of these great compilations that comes under our notice was\r\nmade by Charles Texier, who had already gained fame and experience by\r\nhis ‘Description de l’Asie Mineure,’ published between 1838-48. He was\r\na Government Inspector of Public Works, and he subsequently became\r\nProfessor of Archæology at the Collège de France (1840). He obtained\r\na grant of 160,000 francs to enable him to publish his book, a sum\r\nafterwards reduced to 100,000. He does not seem to have regarded this\r\nmeasure with as much satisfaction as the reader, for he was compelled\r\nupon this occasion to restrict his publication to only two folios; and\r\nhe complains that he had to suppress a considerable portion of his vast\r\ncollections. In 1839 he set out for Persia, and the account of his\r\ntravels was published by instalments between the years 1842 and 1852. In\r\n1849 very few of the plates referring to Persepolis had appeared, and\r\nno text,[167] but Fergusson was able to use a considerable part of the\r\ndrawings, in 1850, for his ‘Nineveh and Persepolis.’\r\n\r\nTexier set out upon his enterprise, as Porter had done before, with a\r\ndesire to aim at the most scrupulous accuracy; but his fatal passion for\r\n‘restorations’ has made sad havoc of his moral aspirations.\r\n\r\nHe began the Persian portion of his work at Van, and travelled steadily\r\nround to Persepolis. Like Flandin, who followed closely on his track,\r\nhe was prevented by the disturbed state of the country from visiting\r\nSusa. He devoted two days (January 12-14, 1840) to Murgab, and gives\r\nsix drawings. He was fully convinced that the famous tomb was that of\r\nCyrus, though the winged figure may be only ‘a prince or magus in the\r\nattitude of devotion.’[168] He confessed he could make nothing of the\r\ngeneral disposition of ‘the Palace’; it consists, as he candidly admits,\r\nof ‘a certain number of pillars, of which the relations cannot be easily\r\nestablished; a large column and remains of walls.’ The second palace\r\nnoticed by Porter seems to have escaped his observation. Persepolis\r\noccupied him for about ten days, and resulted in twenty-four drawings.\r\nHis general views have nothing of the artistic merit afterwards displayed\r\nby Flandin, and they are probably in no degree more accurate. He observed\r\nfrom the _débris_ at the bottom of the outside wall of the Terrace that\r\nit had been originally ornamented by a parapet; and he considered there\r\nwere distinct traces of a triple wall of defence on the hill at the back,\r\nwhich may in some degree account for the description given by Diodorus.\r\nHe thought that nearly all the buildings had been left incomplete, an\r\nopinion that has since gained ground. He maintained that the central\r\ngroup in the Columnar Edifice was intended to be enclosed by a wall and\r\nroofed; and he suggested that the design on the tombs, with a stage\r\nabove, was a correct representation of the architecture of the palaces,\r\na view afterwards supported by the authority of Sir James Fergusson. He\r\nwas fully convinced that the bas-reliefs had been originally coloured;\r\nand one of the chief objects of his journey was to collect evidence on\r\nthis point. It is singular to find that the writer completely ignores the\r\nresults already achieved in decipherment, and that he still describes the\r\nPalaces of Darius and Xerxes as the Hareem and the Baths: an eccentricity\r\ninto which M. Flandin also falls. Texier excels in measurements; they\r\nagree substantially with those of Flandin and Coste, and differ by about\r\nten per cent. from those of Porter.[169] The work of Texier was from\r\nthe first almost completely superseded by that of Flandin, who passed\r\nover the same ground only a few months later (October 1840) and who, as\r\nwe have said, has wisely republished his narrative in a comparatively\r\nportable form.\r\n\r\nWhen the English mission to which Rawlinson was attached withdrew from\r\nPersia, the Shah made overtures to Louis Philippe with a view to replace\r\nthe English by military instructors from France.[170] The French king\r\njudged this a favourable opportunity to reopen diplomatic relations with\r\nPersia, and he accordingly despatched the Count de Sarcey on a mission to\r\nthe Shah. The ambassador was accompanied by a numerous staff, each member\r\nbeing charged with the investigation of a particular subject. The embassy\r\nassumed the character of an exploring expedition quite as much as that of\r\na political mission. One attaché was required to make a special study\r\nof the geology, another of the arts, a third of the industry, as if the\r\ncountry had been hitherto wholly unexplored by Europeans. The proposed\r\nadventure excited much interest, and the two Academies of Inscriptions\r\nand Beaux Arts solicited permission to send representatives. This was\r\nduly accorded, and MM. Flandin and Coste were elected by the suffrage\r\nof the members of the Academies: the one in the capacity of artist, the\r\nother in that of architect.\r\n\r\nM. Coste was already familiar with the East, and was known by a work\r\non the Arabian monuments of Cairo. M. Flandin was apparently unused\r\nto the inconveniences of Oriental travel, and his book presents us\r\nwith a harrowing picture of the sufferings he endured. It is indeed\r\nwonderful that he survived his cook, whom he describes as a ‘véritable\r\nempoisonneur,’ or the numerous lacerations of soul he underwent as,\r\none by one, his friends returned to the shade of the boulevards and\r\nleft him behind a prey to the tortures of the Persian sun. Still more\r\nwonderful that he should have escaped alive from so many perils. At one\r\ntime, he and his horse roll together into a trench from which there\r\nseemed no visible escape; at another, the enthusiastic artist is seen\r\nscrambling up the rock of Behistun with bleeding feet and hands to find\r\nhis toil and peril fruitless, and to accomplish a descent backwards by\r\na ‘véritable gymnastique de lézard’;[171] or again his excitable temper\r\ninvolves him in personal encounters with the natives, in which blows are\r\nfreely exchanged on both sides, and on one occasion he received a stab\r\nwith a poniard. These adventures, however amusing to himself and his\r\nreaders, unfortunately involved his antagonists in shocking punishments\r\nby flogging, which the courtesy of the Persian officials thought it\r\nnecessary to inflict, although Flandin is not always free from the blame\r\nof having been the first to give provocation.\r\n\r\nThe embassy left Toulon on October 30, 1839, but it was not till the\r\nfollowing June that the two artists settled down before the rock of\r\nBehistun, where they found numerous traces of ruins in the plain on\r\nboth sides of the river, which indicate the former existence of a very\r\nconsiderable town; but there was nothing that pointed to an earlier date\r\nthan the Greek and Sassanian periods. The only exception is the cuneiform\r\ninscription on the rock itself. Three years before, Major Rawlinson had\r\nsucceeded, as we have said, in obtaining paper casts of about two hundred\r\nlines of this inscription. M. Flandin does not seem to have been aware of\r\nthis achievement, otherwise he would have been less willing to declare\r\nthat it is impossible to approach. After having ‘done all that was\r\npossible,’ the two travellers went on to Kermanshah. M. Coste proceeded\r\nto Sar-i-Pul-i-Zohab, where he copied a bas-relief, which was afterwards\r\nfound to be of Medic origin; and Flandin was left alone to accomplish the\r\ntask of copying the Sassanian inscriptions at Takht-i-Bostan.[172] After\r\neighteen days of solitude, he returned once more to Behistun in a more\r\nresolute frame of mind. Upon this occasion he brought ladders to assist\r\nhim to scale the rock; but these turned out to be too short. He declared\r\nthat without a scaffolding made expressly for the purpose, it would be\r\nimpossible to accomplish his object, and even then he foresaw great\r\ndifficulties in its erection. As it was, he was without rope, or wood, or\r\nworkmen. He, however, made one last effort, and succeeded at some risk\r\nin scrambling up to the ledge at the base of the tablet. He found the\r\ninscriptions were even then beyond his reach, and it was impossible to\r\nrecede a sufficient distance to obtain a tolerable view. He ascertained\r\nthat they consisted of seven columns, each of ninety-nine lines, and\r\nthat there were also tablets above the figures.[173] It must be admitted\r\nthat the result was extremely unsatisfactory, considering the official\r\nposition of the explorer. He abandoned the enterprise and left the\r\nhonour to Major Rawlinson, who, as soon as political events permitted,\r\nrevisited the scene and completed the task he had already begun. Flandin\r\nand Coste returned to Ispahan in August, and after a period of rest they\r\nproceeded, early in October, to Murgab. Here they remained for two days.\r\nM. Flandin hesitates to accept the identification of the ruins with those\r\nof Pasargadae, and prefers Fasa: an impression which, however, wears\r\noff later, when he had visited that place.[174] He describes the ruins\r\nof the principal palace at Murgab to consist of three pillars and a\r\ncolumn. ‘There are,’ he adds, ‘no means of obtaining sufficient data to\r\nreconstruct the plan. Nothing is to be found except the foundations of\r\ncolumns and pillars, which lead to the belief that it was formerly the\r\nsite of some important structure.’ Not more satisfactory is his notice\r\nof the Terrace, which, he says, is the remains of an edifice of which it\r\nis impossible to recognise the character. These descriptions scarcely\r\nprepare us for the very elaborate plans that appear in the plates, upon\r\nwhich the modern ideas of the place are chiefly based.[175] From Murgab\r\nthey proceeded to Naksh-i-Rustam, where they again allowed themselves to\r\nbe baffled by difficulties that they should certainly not have treated\r\nas insuperable. They observed the long inscription on one of the tombs,\r\nwhich they made no effort to copy, because it happened to be in a\r\nposition which they considered inaccessible. They reconciled themselves\r\nto the omission the more easily on account of its mutilated condition,\r\nwhich they thought would defy the perseverance of the decipherer;\r\notherwise indeed it might be found to record ‘the life of the illustrious\r\ndead intombed within.’[176] Less than two years after they had left,\r\nthis very inscription was copied by the Dane Westergaard; and in 1843,\r\nor seven years before Flandin published his book, it had been deciphered\r\nby Lassen, who found that it declared the tomb on which it was inscribed\r\nto be that of Darius Hystaspes. From their quarters at Husseinabad they\r\nvisited various objects of archæological interest, and made drawings and\r\nplans of them. They finally removed their camp to Persepolis on October\r\n25, and remained there to December 8. During that period of forty-three\r\ndays they made upwards of a hundred magnificent drawings of the place,\r\nwhich will always remain a striking proof of the industry no less than\r\nthe talent of the two artists. The plates include highly-finished\r\npictures of the Terrace and surrounding country taken from various points\r\nof view; admirable drawings of the different buildings, and of all the\r\nnumerous bas-reliefs they contain; ground plans of the platform and of\r\neach of the principal edifices; besides copies of all the inscriptions.\r\nThe work is farther enlivened by a few pictures of Persepolis before it\r\nfell into decay, restored according to the imagination of the ingenious\r\nartists. The scale upon which this work is executed may be judged\r\nfrom the number of plates devoted to the more important objects. The\r\nsculptured staircase fills no less than twenty-two; the Palace of Xerxes\r\nand the Hall of the Hundred Columns occupy twelve each; while sixteen\r\nplates are appropriated to inscriptions.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt of the high artistic merit of these drawings;\r\nbut it must have been impossible within the time to complete them upon\r\nthe spot; and they have no doubt suffered in accuracy by subsequent\r\nelaboration. Sir James Fergusson indeed goes so far as to declare that\r\nthey cannot be relied upon to decide any matter requiring minute accuracy\r\nof detail, and he points out several ‘of their many mistakes.’[177] It\r\nmay be doubted also how far their plans and measurements are absolutely\r\ntrustworthy. There is certainly the most surprising and singular contrast\r\nbetween the doubt and hesitation expressed in the text and the confidence\r\nand minute execution displayed in the plates.[178] The surveys indeed\r\nmay be due chiefly to M. Coste: and it is possible he may not have\r\ncommunicated all the results of his investigations to his volatile\r\ncompanion. While the latter despairs of detecting the plan of the edifice\r\nat Murgab, or those of the Palaces of Darius and Ochus at Persepolis, we\r\nfind all three set down with the utmost precision upon the plans; and\r\nwhile the one traveller declares that all the tombs at Naksh-i-Rustam\r\ncontain accommodation for an equal number of bodies,[179] M. Coste\r\nwas quietly making the plans that refute this statement. It cannot be\r\nadmitted that the combined work possesses any exceptional authority, or\r\nthat it suffices to set at rest the many doubtful points that have arisen\r\nwith reference to these ruins. So far from its having superseded the more\r\ncareful labours of Porter, it is entirely deficient in the minute and\r\naccurate verbal description in which that writer excels.\r\n\r\nThe copies of the inscriptions made by the two explorers have received\r\nthe praise of M. Burnouf, and they are certainly wonderful productions,\r\nespecially when it is considered that neither appears to have had the\r\nsmallest knowledge of the cuneiform writing. If they had been able to\r\nface the perils of Behistun or the difficulties of Naksh-i-Rustam, they\r\nmight still have anticipated the work of Rawlinson and Westergaard.\r\nAt Persepolis itself there was little that was now left for them to\r\naccomplish. They appear to have been the first in point of time to make\r\na serviceable copy of the inscriptions over the Porch; Rich, it will\r\nbe recollected, was forced to abandon them to his Seyid, who failed in\r\nthe attempt. But this inscription was first published by Westergaard,\r\nalthough his copy was made two years after that of Flandin. Flandin\r\nseems, however, to have been the first to publish the inscription of\r\nArtaxerxes Ochus from the west stairs of the Palace of Darius; but the\r\nsame inscription occurs also on the Palace of Ochus, and this was already\r\nwell known through the copy made by Rich. MM. Flandin and Coste have\r\nnot therefore made any contribution to our knowledge of the cuneiform\r\ninscriptions. They, however, carried on somewhat extensive excavations.\r\nThey employed labourers to clear away the rubbish that had accumulated\r\nin the palaces and which obscured the lower portion of the bas-reliefs.\r\nBy this means they brought to light a Sassanian relief at Naksh-i-Rustam\r\nwhich had hitherto been unobserved, and which they found to be covered\r\nwith a Pehlevi inscription.[180] At Persepolis they claim to have\r\ndiscovered eight entirely new bas-reliefs, besides disclosing the lower\r\nportion of many others.[181] They dug up the statue of a bull near the\r\neast stairs of the Palace of Xerxes, the only monument _en ronde_ which\r\nhas been found among the ruins.[182] They disclosed the head of a bull\r\namong the _débris_ of the Porch, and finally set at rest the long debated\r\nquestion as to the nature of the colossal animals. They completed the\r\nportraiture of the guards on the façade of the sculptured staircase,\r\nby raising the fallen masonry.[183] They were the first to clear away\r\nthe rubbish that had collected in the Palace of Darius, and to disclose\r\nthe bases of the columns that had supported the roof.[184] They settled\r\nthe nature of the monster with which the king is seen to struggle, by\r\nunearthing its tail, which proved to be that of a scorpion.[185] They\r\nwere the first also to show the correct position and number of the\r\ncolumns in the Portico of the Palace of Xerxes. They were also the\r\nfirst to show the former existence of columns in the South-Eastern\r\nEdifice.[186] Fragments of columns strewn on the ground within the Hall\r\nof the Hundred Columns had been remarked by Kaempfer and by Niebuhr;\r\nbut they do not seem to have been observed by Flandin and Coste. It was\r\ndue to their laborious excavations that it was ascertained, after six\r\nand a half feet of rubbish had been cleared away, that the edifice had\r\noriginally contained ten rows of columns of ten in each in the centre,\r\nand two rows of eight in the Portico.[187]\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the year 1841, they found themselves at Fasa, and\r\nspeedily recognised that it could not compete with Murgab as the\r\nrepresentative of Pasargadae. On their return to Shiraz, they ascertained\r\nthat Baron de Bode, an attaché to the Russian embassy, had just left\r\nfor Susa. When at Kermanshah, in the preceding summer, they abandoned\r\nan attempt to reach that place from the south through the defiles of\r\nLuristan. Such an enterprise would probably not have been very easy even\r\nto travellers much better suited to deal with the turbulent tribes; and\r\nit would most likely have proved fatal to one of M. Flandin’s excitable\r\ntemperament. But now an opportunity offered to follow close upon the\r\nsteps of a traveller protected by the authority of a diplomatic mission,\r\nand along a route that circumstances rendered at that time exceptionally\r\nsecure.[188] M. Flandin finds some difficulty in excusing his neglect to\r\nperform a journey which his commission seemed to demand. He tells us that\r\nhis purse had begun to feel the strain of eight months’ travel, although\r\nwe find it was still sufficient to support the cost of another year in\r\nsafer and pleasanter quarters.[189] Having abandoned this project, they\r\nreturned for a few days to Persepolis, in order to obtain a few plaster\r\ncasts of the more striking bas-reliefs. They reached Teheran on March\r\n20, where they met Baron de Bode, who had just returned from Susa. The\r\ninspection of the antiquities he had collected ‘in that country, the\r\nobject of our regrets,’ must have excited some mortifying reflections;\r\nthough they gladly inferred from the drawings that the place ‘offered\r\nin reality little of interest.’[190] The excavations of Mr. Loftus, ten\r\nyears later, dispelled this flattering illusion. After a month spent\r\nin the enjoyment of royal favour, they left Teheran (April 24), and\r\nproceeded by Tabriz and Urmia to Bagdad, which they reached in July.\r\nM. Flandin bade farewell to Persian territory after a free interchange\r\nof blows with the people of the frontier village.[191] From Bagdad he\r\npaid hurried visits to Hillah and Mosul; and left early in September for\r\nAleppo and Beyrout, where he embarked for France on December 1, 1841.\r\n\r\nHe revisited the East in 1843, in order to sketch the monuments\r\ndiscovered by M. Botta at Khorsabad. In consequence of this employment,\r\nthe publication of the results of the Persian journey was greatly\r\ndelayed. The ‘Voyage en Perse’ was not even written till 1850, and it did\r\nnot appear till the following year.[192] The folio edition with plates\r\nbears no date. A portion of the plates was used by Mr. Fergusson in 1850,\r\nfor his book on the Palaces of Nineveh and Persepolis, but they were\r\nnot available the year before.[193] They brought home two hundred and\r\nfifty-four drawings and thirty-five copies of inscriptions, most of which\r\nthey profess to have executed on the spot;[194] and the collection forms\r\nan extremely valuable addition to our knowledge of the antiquities of\r\nPersia. M. Flandin was strongly of opinion that no individual enterprise\r\ncould hope to compete with the minuteness of research and the untiring\r\nindustry of an official like himself, who was charged with a Government\r\nmission, and invested with the confidence of two academical bodies.[195]\r\nA Government can indeed afford to publish a book no one can afford to\r\nbuy, but it seems unable to imbue its commissioners with the energy so\r\nfrequently displayed by private individuals. The lamentable failure of\r\nMessrs. Flandin and Coste before the rock of Behistun and the tomb of\r\nDarius; besides the serenity with which they abandoned even an attempt\r\nto reach Susa, afford sufficient evidence of this. M. Coste is scarcely\r\neven mentioned in the ‘Voyage’; but we see enough of M. Flandin to\r\nrecognise that he did not possess the qualities that make a successful\r\nexplorer. His narrative is interrupted and disfigured by puerile details\r\nof personal adventure in which he evinces a complete absence of the\r\ncoolness, the nerve and the tact requisite for his task. He magnifies to\r\nabsurd proportions the risks to which he is exposed; he is constantly\r\ninvolved in humiliating personal encounters with the people of the\r\ncountry, in which he displays vastly more temper than courage. The reader\r\nmight be tempted to regard these conflicts with some complacency, if it\r\nwere not for the excruciating punishment with which the politeness of the\r\nPersian authorities thought fit to visit his assailants.[196]\r\n\r\nVery little more now remained to be done to illustrate all that is\r\nnecessary to know of these Persian ruins. The inscriptions had been\r\nsuccessfully recovered and many times copied. The Persian text had\r\nbeen fully translated, and only a few obscure passages awaited farther\r\nelucidation. Still the most careful accounts were found to conflict\r\non many points, and neither Porter nor his successors had removed the\r\ndiscrepancies and contradictions that had been so long remarked.\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of many years, it was determined to appeal to the new\r\nart of photography, in order to obtain a degree of accuracy that could\r\nnot be achieved by the pencil. The first to make the attempt was a\r\nMr. Ellis, but his negatives were entirely destroyed in the course of\r\nthe rough journey to the sea. At length Herr Stolze made another and\r\nvery successful effort.[197] He was attached to a German scientific\r\nexpedition, sent out to the East in 1874, under the direction of Dr.\r\nAndreas, to observe the transit of Venus. Stolze spent some time\r\ntravelling over Persia, and visited among other places Persepolis and\r\nFasa in the winter of 1874; but his real work began in June 1878, a\r\nseason of the year when the heat is excessive, and when the process\r\nof developing the negatives within a closed box involved actual\r\nsuffering. Notwithstanding these disadvantages he took upwards of three\r\nhundred plates between the date of his arrival on June 16 and his\r\ndeparture on July 3. He found the vertical sun of summer better suited\r\nfor photographing the inscriptions than the bas-reliefs, especially\r\nthose situated in the deep shade of the doorways. One of his greatest\r\nachievements was the photogrammetric plan of Persepolis, which surpasses\r\nany previous attempt to arrive at an accurate survey. It is said that no\r\nfewer than three hundred and fifty plates were used in the construction\r\nof the three metrical plans at the end of his second volume.[198]\r\nAfter a few days spent at Murgab, he hastened back to cooler quarters.\r\nHis negatives were so carefully packed that they all reached Europe in\r\nsafety. Unfortunately, one case was opened at the London Custom House,\r\nand the plates were replaced so loosely by the bungling official that\r\na few were cracked; but even these have been pieced together without\r\nretaining much trace of their ill usage. In the course of his travels he\r\ntook no fewer than fourteen hundred negatives, and in the spring of 1879\r\nhe had the satisfaction to find himself at Berlin with his treasures. In\r\nSeptember 1881, he submitted a few of the completed photographs to the\r\nFifth Oriental Congress, and they sanctioned the publication of those\r\nrelating to the Achaemenian and Sassanian periods. The result was the\r\nappearance, in 1882, of ‘Die Achaemenidischen Denkmäler von Persepolis,’\r\nphotographed by Stolze and edited by Noeldeke; and two more ponderous and\r\nmagnificent folios were thus added to the growing mass of inaccessible\r\nlore. Persepolis alone occupies ninety-nine plates, and the scale on\r\nwhich the work is executed may be judged from the devotion of twenty-one\r\nviews to the Palace of Darius, eighteen to the Palace of Xerxes, twelve\r\nto the Hall of the Hundred Columns, and twelve to the Hall of Xerxes.\r\nNine plates (106-14) are devoted to Naksh-i-Rustam and eleven (127-37)\r\nto Murgab. It is doubtful how far the photographic process will assist\r\nthe student of the inscriptions. Noeldeke fears it will be of little\r\nvalue as regards the Pehlevi; and certainly little can be made out of the\r\ncuneiform except by the constant and painful use of a powerful magnifying\r\nglass. They may, however, be occasionally useful to decide disputed\r\npoints: as, for example, the photograph of the inscription on the Anta\r\nof the Palace of Darius proves that the transcription of Westergaard\r\nis correct, and that of Rich wrong (Plate XIII.). Another photograph\r\nshows that the error in one of Niebuhr’s copies is due to a defect in\r\nthe original.[199] Elsewhere Niebuhr is shown to be even more careful\r\nthan Westergaard.[200] The photographs of the monuments and bas-reliefs\r\nmeet with a very varying measure of success. Some are so blurred and\r\nindistinct that it is fortunate that they are each labelled in German,\r\nFrench and English; otherwise we might doubt whether they are correctly\r\ndescribed.[201] Comparative success is reached more frequently, and\r\nexcellence occasionally. It is particularly unfortunate that the great\r\nsculptured staircase has not been taken on a sufficiently large scale\r\nto bring out the figures with distinctness (Pl. 77 ff.); Noeldeke is,\r\nhowever, of opinion that it is the best view of them taken since Ouseley,\r\nthus passing over both Porter and the two French artists, Texier and\r\nFlandin. Among the most valuable views from Murgab are the two plates\r\nshowing the Tomb of Cyrus (Pl. 128-9). The series closes with what might\r\npass for a snowy mountain in Switzerland, but which is explained to be\r\nfragments of a bas-relief at Pasargadae (Pl. 137). Noeldeke, like Texier,\r\nfully believes in the destruction of some of the buildings by fire, and\r\nhe also considers that few of them were ever thoroughly completed; indeed\r\nhe attributes to that cause the absence of all traces of walls round\r\nthe Hall of Xerxes, or of a roof. He thinks there never were any more\r\ncolumns than can now be identified, and that some even of these were left\r\nunfinished. The same applies to the Entrance Porch; possibly the gates\r\non the North and South sides (which are supposed to have been part of\r\nthe general design) were never erected; nor the second pair of columns.\r\nAt the instigation of Dr. Andreas, a trench was dug into the Central\r\nMound, which had long been the object of so many conjectures, with the\r\ndisappointing result that it was found to contain nothing but cuttings\r\ndiscarded by the masons.\r\n\r\nThree years later, in 1881, these ruins were visited by M. Dieulafoy\r\nand his wife, Madame Dieulafoy, who notwithstanding the disabilities of\r\nher sex, has been appointed a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour and an\r\nOfficer of the Academy. The journey has resulted in the production of two\r\nvast works: one an elaborate treatise on ‘L’Art antique de la Perse,’\r\nin five volumes, petit in-folio, 1884, by Monsieur Dieulafoy; and a\r\nsingle volume of massive proportions descriptive of their travels by the\r\nvaliant and industrious lady.[202] M. Dieulafoy is one of the best known\r\nwriters in France on architecture, and his opinions, though at times as\r\nfanciful as those of M. Flandin, are always worthy of respect. Madame\r\nDieulafoy displayed marvellous pluck in the course of her adventures,\r\nand extraordinary expansiveness in their relation. When the span of life\r\nis lengthened to that enjoyed by the patriarchs, there will be time to\r\nstudy her works at leisure. One other traveller should be named who has\r\ngiven an admirable account of Persepolis, and, if detached from its\r\ncumbrous surroundings, one more adapted to the pressure of modern times.\r\nLord Curzon visited Persia in 1889-90 and he has devoted a chapter of\r\nhis Travels (chap. xxi. vol. ii.) to the subject. It is by far the best\r\ndescription we know, and affords all the information that need be sought.\r\nHe frequently calls attention to the extraordinary contradictions to be\r\nfound in the various writings on the subject, which, from the days of\r\nPorter, it has been the constant aim of successive travellers to remove.\r\nIn mere matters of opinion there is, of course, no prospect of reaching\r\nunanimity in this or in any other subject. Whether the great halls were\r\nwalled and roofed, or protected only by falling curtains; whether the\r\npalaces were ever occupied as residences or reserved only for state\r\nceremonial, and a host of other disputed questions, will remain points of\r\ncontroversy. Each successive traveller with pretensions to originality\r\nto establish will continue to put forward new theories, and he will\r\nillustrate the beauty of his imagination by elaborate drawings of his\r\nconjectural restorations. These are inevitable failings of humanity and\r\nmust be treated with toleration; but it is different when mere questions\r\nof fact are involved. After three centuries of travellers to Persepolis,\r\nwe have still to reiterate the desire of Fergusson that some one may yet\r\nbe found ‘who will go there with his eyes open, which does not seem yet\r\nto have been the case.’[203] Although the sun itself has been summoned\r\nto share in the task, even still there is a conflict of evidence as to\r\nthe number of windows in the Hall of the Hundred Columns, as to the\r\nnumber and position of the columns in the Palace of Darius, and many\r\nother points too tedious to mention. There may indeed be more important\r\nquestions in the world awaiting solution than even the exact construction\r\nof a Persepolitan palace, but it is irritating to find, notwithstanding\r\nour painful quest, that Truth evades our grasp in this as in weightier\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nPersepolis was fully known and its inscriptions translated before any\r\nattempt was made to explore the site of Susa. Major Rennell was among the\r\nfirst to identify it with Shus, about fifteen miles S.W. of Dizful.[204]\r\nThe place was visited in 1810 by Captains Kinneir and Monteith, who\r\nwere attached to the mission of Sir John Malcolm.[205] The former\r\ndescribes the ruins as lying about seven or eight miles to the west of\r\nDizful and not unlike those of Babylon. He describes it as consisting\r\nof a succession of mounds covered with fragments of bricks and coloured\r\ntiles extending over nearly twelve miles. Two mounds attracted special\r\nattention. The first rises to a height of a hundred feet and is about\r\na mile in circumference. At its base is the reputed Tomb of Daniel, a\r\nbuilding that appears comparatively modern. The other mound is not quite\r\nso high, but it is nearly two miles in circumference. They are composed\r\nof a mixture of brick and clay, with irregular layers of brick and mortar\r\nfive or six feet thick to serve as a prop. Large blocks of marble covered\r\nwith hieroglyphics were reported to be occasionally discovered by the\r\nArabs.[206] One of these—the famous ‘black stone’—was seen by Captain\r\nMonteith near the Tomb of Daniel, where it had recently been rolled down\r\nfrom the summit of the Citadel Hill. It was not more than twenty-two\r\ninches long and twelve broad, but it had a cuneiform inscription on one\r\nside, and various sacred emblems represented upon the other. He made\r\na sketch of it and might then have purchased it at a moderate price;\r\nbut, though not large, it was found impossible at that time to remove\r\nit. Shortly afterwards two other Englishmen—the unfortunate Grant and\r\nFotheringham—offered seventy pounds for it, but their intention to take\r\nit with them on their return was frustrated by their murder.[207] The\r\nvalue set upon it by the foreigners raised it in the estimation of the\r\nnatives to such a height that the subsequent effort of Mr. Gordon to get\r\npossession of it utterly failed (1812).[208] It was already invested\r\nwith the mysterious virtue of a talisman, and its loss, it was thought,\r\nwould involve the country in disaster. To secure its retention resort was\r\nhad to the singular expedient of blowing it into a hundred fragments by\r\ngunpowder. The destruction, however, was not complete, and the fragments\r\nwere afterwards carefully collected, and secretly built into a pillar in\r\nthe Tomb of Daniel, where they now are. In 1836 Rawlinson was able to\r\npass two days amid the ruins in the course of his march from Zohab to\r\nShuster. His visit, he thought, had enabled him to ‘unravel the mystery\r\nof the two rivers Eulaeus and Choaspes.’ He heard that the ‘black stone’\r\nhad been blown to pieces, but he was evidently not informed that the\r\nfragments were collected and were then in the Tomb of Daniel. He was\r\nrewarded, however, by the discovery of a broken obelisk with ‘a very\r\nperfect inscription of thirty-three lines,’ which was afterwards found to\r\nbe written in Old Susian.[209] Five years later, Mr. Layard penetrated\r\ninto the tomb disguised in Arab dress, and was told by a dervish that the\r\nprecious inscription was buried there. In the outer court he was shown\r\none or two small capitals and other vestiges of columns that had fallen\r\nfrom the mound; and also the fragment of a slab with a few cuneiform\r\ncharacters almost obliterated. The mound appeared to him little inferior\r\nin size to the Mujelibi, and he found and copied an inscription from a\r\nmarble slab nine feet long by two feet six inches broad.[210] It was\r\nduring this visit to Persia that he went to Malamir, in the valley of the\r\nUpper Karun, south-east of Susa, where he copied two long inscriptions,\r\nin a dialect of the Susian, one of thirty-six lines and the other\r\nof twenty-four, and made drawings of the singular bas-reliefs which\r\naccompany them.[211]\r\n\r\nThe first information of importance concerning Susa comes, however, from\r\nMr. Loftus. He was attached as geologist to Sir W. F. Williams’s mission\r\nfor the delimitation of the Turkish and Persian frontier, between 1849\r\nand 1852. His first visit to Susa was made in May 1850. The ruins, he\r\nsays, cover an area of about 3½ miles in circumference, within which four\r\nseparate mounds are distinctly marked. The loftiest he estimated at about\r\n2,850 feet round the summit, and it had evidently been the citadel.[212]\r\nTo the north is a larger mound at a lower elevation, and here it was\r\nthat he was rewarded by the discovery of the ancient palace. To the east\r\nof these is another, which he calls the Great Platform; it covers sixty\r\nacres, and does not exceed seventy feet in height. Beyond it, still\r\nfarther eastward, may be discerned some remains that indicate the place\r\nwhere the city itself stood (No. 4 on plan).\r\n\r\nThe excavations were begun in 1851 and at first without decisive result.\r\nThree trenches were ‘dug into the citadel mound to the depth of nineteen\r\nfeet, but failed to discover anything except portions of a brick\r\npavement, fragments of moulded composition-bricks stamped with cuneiform\r\nand covered with green glaze.’[213]\r\n\r\nIt was not till the following year that Mr. Loftus succeeded in\r\nexcavating a building almost exactly similar to the Columnar Edifice at\r\nPersepolis. He determined the position of twenty-one bases of the central\r\ngroup; two bases in each row of the eastern colonnade, and three of the\r\nwestern. On the north he found three bases, all in the inner row, and\r\nit is still doubtful if there ever was a second row on this side.[214]\r\nHe ascertained that the building consisted, as at Persepolis, of a\r\ncentral square of thirty-six columns, surrounded on three sides by a\r\ncolonnade, and we are indebted to him for the measurements. His opinion\r\nis that the central group was roofed, but not enclosed by a wall, and\r\nthe space between it and the colonnades was open.[215] He searched in\r\nvain for the traces of walls such as Fergusson suggested had existed\r\nat Persepolis; and was the more convinced that none had ever existed\r\nbecause he found distinct traces of foundations elsewhere. He brought\r\nto light a trilingual inscription, repeated four times on the bases of\r\nthe columns, which were found to have been written by Artaxerxes Mnemon\r\n(Inscr. S). They are of more than usual interest, for the King traces\r\nhis genealogy back to Hystaspes, and confirms thereby the statement of\r\nHerodotus. He states also that he built the hall, or, as he calls it, the\r\nApadana, on the site of an earlier edifice erected by the great Darius,\r\nand afterwards destroyed by fire during the reign of Artaxerxes I. He\r\nlikewise invokes Mithra and Anahita for the first time side by side with\r\nOrmuzd as tutelary deities. Another evidence of degeneracy is seen in the\r\ncorruption of the language, which exhibits several grammatical solecisms.\r\nAnother short trilingual legend of the same king was found round a\r\ncolumn in a different part of the mound, and several detached bricks and\r\nvases with the names of Darius and Xerxes, but no other trilinguals of\r\nimportance. On the other hand, the long inscription in thirty-three lines\r\nfound by Rawlinson on the Citadel Hill, and the two inscriptions found\r\nby Layard at Malamir, gave rise to fresh difficulties. It was recognised\r\nthat the writing was different from any yet known; and the perplexity\r\nwas heightened when it was farther observed that they differed from one\r\nanother. Here, then, were two new methods of writing, and possibly two\r\nnew languages added to those already in hand; and there seemed to be no\r\nend to the task imposed on the cuneiform student. For some time little\r\neffort was made to grapple with these new problems. The script found on\r\nthe Citadel Hill received the provisional name of ‘Old Susian,’ and many\r\nother specimens of it gradually accumulated. Subsequent investigations\r\nhave shown that the writing and language found at Susa and Malamir are\r\nrelated to those in the second column of the trilingual inscriptions.\r\nIt is now ascertained that the Old Susian is the most ancient form; and\r\nthat the script and language of the second column descends from it,\r\nthrough the medium of the script and language found at Malamir. The\r\nOld Susian inscriptions were translated by Oppert in 1876, and those\r\nof Malamir by Professor Sayce in 1885. These documents were generally\r\nreferred to kings contemporary with Sargon and Sennacherib, though others\r\nsubsequently found were attributed to the fourteenth century B.C. Still\r\nlater discoveries have proved that the Old Susian was in use at least as\r\nearly as B.C. 3000. The origin of the ‘New Susian’ of the second column\r\nhas thus been carried back to a great antiquity; and the existence of a\r\nvery ancient population in Elam, speaking a Scythic language has been\r\nestablished. The relation between the Scythic of Elam and the Scythic of\r\nSouthern Babylonia has not yet, we believe, been universally admitted.\r\nThere are powerful interests at work to dwarf or deny the extension and\r\ninfluence of the Turanian races, both in Elam and in Babylonia, and till\r\nthese have been surmounted, it will be difficult to estimate correctly\r\nthe exact state of the evidence.\r\n\r\nIt was not till thirty-three years had elapsed from the date of Mr.\r\nLoftus’s discoveries that Susa was again visited. Upon this occasion\r\n(1885) the enterprising traveller was M. Dieulafoy, whom we have already\r\nmentioned, and it is to these two travellers that we owe nearly all\r\nwe know of its Achaemenian remains. Mr. Loftus must always enjoy the\r\nhonour of being the first to reconstruct the Columnar Hall, and it was\r\nhe also through whom the two inscriptions of Artaxerxes Mnemon became\r\nfirst known. M. Dieulafoy, on the other hand, has largely increased our\r\nknowledge of Persian art by the discovery of the enamelled friezes. The\r\nservice he has rendered towards the reconstruction of the buildings is\r\nmore problematical, for a large portion of it depends upon the justness\r\nof the imaginative faculty, which is never a very sure guide in such\r\nmatters. He found three or four bases in the central cluster of the\r\nHall not previously excavated by Loftus; but they add nothing to our\r\nknowledge of its construction, which the earlier traveller had already\r\nfully determined. M. Dieulafoy’s most successful work was achieved on\r\nthe occasion of his second visit to Susa, in 1885. At first it was\r\ndifficult to collect workmen, but a few deserters from the army were\r\nattracted, when it became known that the pay offered was about equal to\r\nthat of their colonel. Before the end of the month nearly three hundred\r\nmen were collected, and excavations were energetically pursued upon\r\neach of the three hills. A double-headed bull, broken into convenient\r\nfragments, was found in the eastern colonnade of the great Hall, and the\r\npavement of a terrace on the south was reached.[216] At length (March\r\n21), large quantities of bricks and enamelled tiles were found which,\r\nwhen put together, formed various devices, men and animals of gigantic\r\nsize, triangles of alternate blue, green and white, palm leaves and other\r\ndecorative designs, evidently parts of a frieze.[217] The brilliant\r\ncolours were marvellously preserved from having lain so long face\r\ndownwards. Soon after, the base of a column, signed by Artaxerxes Mnemon,\r\nwas found in the larger mound. Meanwhile Madame Dieulafoy supervised the\r\ncollection of the enamels, and as they were pieced together the floor\r\nof her tent was gradually enlivened by the apparition of a magnificent\r\nlion set in blue turquoise.[218] Numerous repetitions of the same device\r\nwere found, indicating a procession of these majestic animals. A few\r\ncuneiform letters were also met, tinted with blue. The enamels had\r\nclearly fallen from a great height, and had formed the decoration of the\r\nupper portion of a wall. It was evident also that the building they came\r\nfrom had been preceded by a still more ancient edifice to which some of\r\nthe bricks had belonged.[219] Almost as interesting was the discovery\r\nclose to their camp on the south side of the Apadana of the parapet of a\r\nstaircase richly ornamented with yellow and blue lotus flowers, set in a\r\nrich green foundation.[220] The excavations conducted at two points of\r\nthe Citadel Hill had as yet proved unproductive. They had occupied fifty\r\nmen constantly for two months, and had only resulted in the discovery\r\nof a few bricks with Susian texts, and some fragments of cut stone. Not\r\nmuch more success had rewarded their attack upon the large mound to\r\nthe east. Here little was found except immense walls of crude brick and\r\nthe remains of a cemetery of Parthian times. Farther search had now,\r\nhowever, to be postponed on account of the approach of the hot weather.\r\nOn April 28 work was suspended and the treasures packed. Fifty-five cases\r\nwere despatched, containing the lion frieze and the decoration of the\r\nstairs. They were, however, seized at the Turkish frontier, and all the\r\nattempts of M. Dieulafoy to smuggle them on board a French steamer were\r\nfrustrated. Fortunately, the head of the lion and many small objects\r\nwere hidden away in the personal luggage and thus escaped detention.\r\nThe travellers got back to France in July, and were then informed that\r\nthe Shah had revoked the firman and would not permit them to return. It\r\nappears that the Mollahs at Dizful had discovered that the torrential\r\nrains and threatening clouds that had lately visited the country were due\r\nto the presence of the foreigners so near the holy Tomb of Daniel. The\r\ninfidels had disturbed the resting-places of the faithful and removed\r\nthe talismans buried by the prophets for the protection of Susiana. It\r\nwas abundantly proved that their unholy presence was always accompanied\r\nby signs of divine wrath and followed by terrible plagues. After much\r\nnegotiation, however, leave to return was obtained, on condition that\r\nthe French Government would waive the claim to indemnity if, as seemed\r\nprobable, their agents should perish in their forthcoming visit. This\r\nsingular condition was subsequently modified, and while the Shah\r\ndisclaimed all responsibility for the safety of the mission, he renewed\r\nthe firman for a limited time.[221] It was perhaps partly in consequence\r\nof these negotiations, and partly to stimulate the Turkish Government\r\nto surrender the fifty-five cases still in their possession, that the\r\ntravellers re-appeared in the Persian Gulf on board a French man-of-war,\r\nwhich had not been seen in those waters for three years. On their way\r\nthey stopped at Muscat, and the officers were duly entertained at the\r\nLawn Tennis Club by the ubiquitous English.[222]\r\n\r\nM. Dieulafoy resumed operations at Susa on December 13, 1885. The firman\r\nwas to expire on April 1, and their funds were now reduced to 15,000\r\nfrancs.[223] They accordingly determined to abandon the hope of a\r\nthorough investigation and to content themselves with the humbler task\r\nof filling the Museum. They now concentrated all their efforts on the\r\nPalace Hill: by the end of the year they had come upon the foundation\r\nof the Palace of Darius, which had been buried beneath the ruins of\r\nthe later Palace of Artaxerxes. At this depth they made their second\r\ngreat discovery of enamelled tiles, bearing the design of the archers,\r\nan ornament attached to an earlier structure. It was, however, found\r\nsixty metres from the Apadana and could not, therefore, have been a\r\nportion of the decoration of the palace.[224] At a little distance, in\r\nthe plain, they came upon a small Achaemenian building which Dieulafoy\r\ndeclared to be a covered fire temple.[225] By the middle of February the\r\nexhausted state of their finances compelled them to dismiss a hundred\r\nof their workmen. The clearance of the palace, however, continued.\r\nSeveral more bases were found, and another double bull, which was\r\nshattered into portable form by a stroke from the powerful arm of the\r\nlady Chevalier.[226] A sketch was also completed of the fortification\r\nfor two-thirds of its circumference, a work that produces a startling\r\neffect upon the reader who looks at Plate 2. Little now remained but\r\nthe task of collecting their treasures. The process of packing and\r\nsuperintending the removal of such weighty objects occupied the rest of\r\ntheir time, and when they left, at the end of March, they brought away\r\nthree hundred and twenty-seven cases and forty-five tons of baggage. When\r\nthe difficult journey to the coast was successfully overcome, they found\r\na man-of-war ready to transport them safely back to France. They had\r\nacquired inestimable archæological riches, which are now to be seen among\r\nthe precious collections of the Louvre. These remains of Achaemenian\r\npalaces, as they say, were not torn from some splendid ruin, but called\r\nback to life from the hidden embrace of the grave; and they were acquired\r\nat the peril of their lives. The Susian mission waged an almost hopeless\r\nbattle and came off victorious.[227] We fear, however, that a good deal\r\nof M. Dieulafoy’s industry was misdirected. If a third plate were to be\r\nprepared, marking only the ‘Restorations directes d’après les fouilles,’\r\nand omitting the lines indicating the ‘Restorations calculées’ and the\r\n‘Restitutions hypothétiques,’ the reader would be surprised to see how\r\nlittle of the ‘Acropole de Suse’ remained. The great staircase ascending\r\nto the Apadana or Columnar Edifice seems to be also entirely without\r\nauthority, and his most ingenious speculations are to a great extent\r\ncompletely overthrown by the excavations of his successor.\r\n\r\nSince the mission of M. Dieulafoy, a most advantageous concession has\r\nbeen made to France. In 1895 the Shah accorded to that favoured nation\r\nan exclusive right to carry on archæological excavations throughout the\r\nwhole of his dominions. This concession was extended in August 1900, and\r\nwas rendered perpetual, with the farther privilege of retaining all the\r\nartistic objects discovered.[228] M. de Morgan, who had already acquired\r\na great reputation by his travels in Persia and his work in Egypt, was\r\nappointed in 1897 to carry on the explorations, and with the protection\r\nof a Persian garrison he began his operations in December of that year.\r\nThey are still in progress, but he has been able to publish an account of\r\nhis discoveries up to the spring of 1899. He has been described as the\r\nPrince of Excavators; and it is indeed a most fortunate circumstance that\r\nthis work should have fallen into such unusually competent hands. He has\r\nample time at his disposal, and sufficient means to employ no less than\r\nfive hundred men at a time. He is satisfied to carry out his undertaking\r\nin a patient and painstaking manner. He has the merit of keeping his\r\nimaginative faculty under severe restraint, and we have little cause\r\nto apprehend an apparition of the airy fancies that so many of his\r\npredecessors have substituted for solid toil.\r\n\r\nIn his excavations on the site of the Apadana, he has been unable to\r\nverify the existence of the three bases belonging to the inner row of the\r\nnorthern colonnade. They were, however, among the first to be discovered\r\nby Mr. Loftus, and as he did not belong to the inventive group of\r\ntravellers there can be no doubt they are to be found.[229] De Morgan is\r\nof opinion that the northern colonnade could never have contained more\r\nthan a single row of columns, on account of the nature of the ground,\r\nwhich, he says, would not admit of more. His careful excavations between\r\nthe central group and the lateral colonnades have proved the entire\r\nabsence of any foundations upon which a solid structure could rest. It\r\nis clear, therefore, that the building could never have been enclosed\r\nby brick walls, adorned, as so commonly supposed, by enamelled designs.\r\nThe theory supported by the Book of Esther that it was protected only by\r\nhanging curtains gains, therefore, probability, though we do not see that\r\nthe supposition of its having been surrounded by wood is excluded. Below\r\nthe foundations of Artaxerxes he found farther remains of the earlier\r\nedifice of Darius. Among these were the round base of a column and part\r\nof a bull-headed capital.[230] Elsewhere, lying at a still greater\r\ndepth, he came upon a fluted column of a style entirely different from\r\nthose in the more modern edifice. His investigations on the southern\r\nside have dispelled any hope of finding a sculptured staircase as at\r\nPersepolis.[231]\r\n\r\nHis discoveries have contributed largely to widen the range of\r\ninformation concerning the ancient civilisation of Susiana. He has found\r\nupwards of eight hundred bricks bearing the inscriptions of various\r\nElamite kings and patesis written in the Old Susian language; some of\r\nthese are said to go back to B.C. 3000, or earlier, and a few of them are\r\nwritten, according to M. de Morgan, in Sumerian and others in Semitic.\r\nBesides bricks, a bronze bas-relief, and a few archaic tablets and a\r\nstele with Susian inscriptions have also been discovered. Other objects\r\nnot of Elamite origin have been met which it is reasonable to conclude\r\nwere captured in the course of successful raids. They go back to the\r\nearliest days of Babylonian history. One is an obelisk of a King of\r\nKish who lived, it is said, so far back as B.C. 3850.[232] Another is a\r\nbas-relief of the famous Naram Sin carried off from Sippara; a third is\r\na brick of the same king, a possible indication that he was at one time\r\nthe suzerain of the country, and contributed to the embellishment of its\r\ntemples. In addition to these, many boundary stones have been found,\r\nall relating to land in Chaldæa belonging to the late Cossaean period,\r\nwhich prove how successful the Elamites continued to be in removing their\r\nneighbours’ landmarks.[233]\r\n\r\nPerhaps of greater interest is the glimpse these excavations have\r\nafforded of a still more distant past. M. de Morgan found that the\r\nCitadel Hill has reached its present altitude of one hundred and twenty\r\nfeet above the plain entirely by the accumulation of deposit left by\r\nsuccessive generations of settlers.\r\n\r\nHe sank a series of mines of considerable length into the side of the\r\nhill, and at various depths, down to 24·90 metres below the surface. The\r\nAchaemenian remains reach no farther down than 4·50 metres, and this\r\nstratum represents a period extending over 2,500 years. If we assume a\r\nsimilar rate of deposit for the remainder we arrive at more than B.C.\r\n12,000 for the date of the lowest stratum examined. It is very remarkable\r\nthat it was precisely at this depth, representing in any case an\r\nextremely remote period, that he found the most finished pottery, adorned\r\nwith the most perfect artistic designs; and these, he has no doubt, could\r\nnot have been produced except in a high state of civilisation.[234] There\r\nis some resemblance between these objects and others recently found in\r\nEgypt and ascribed to B.C. 6000.[235] This early civilisation seems to\r\nhave been swept away by the invasion of a people in a much less advanced\r\ncondition, who occupied the country for a long period of time;[236] it is\r\nnot till these had disappeared and we ascend to a level of 12·95 metres\r\nbelow the surface that we come to the beginning of the Elamite deposit.\r\nIt has a thickness of from eight to nine metres, which, according to our\r\nestimate, would require about five thousand years to form. It was in this\r\nstratum, between 4·50 and 12·95 metres below the surface that he made his\r\nprincipal discoveries. Here he came upon the walls of Elamite palaces and\r\ntemples, which have enabled him to show that the method of decoration by\r\nmeans of enamelled brick of exquisite colour and design was extensively\r\npractised. The quantity of carbonised material leads to the conclusion\r\nthat wood was largely employed in the construction of these edifices;\r\nand the remains of columns prove that the Persians derived their idea of\r\ncolumnar architecture direct from their predecessors. The inscriptions\r\nso recently found are still in the hands of Father Scheil, who is now\r\nengaged in the work of decipherment. They show, he says, the influence\r\nof Semitic speech in Elam at an early period, and the advocates of the\r\nantiquity of Semitic civilisation begin to hope they may still have\r\noccasion to rejoice.\r\n\r\nVery few other inscriptions remain for us to notice. Before the\r\nend of the eighteenth century a vase of Xerxes was discovered in\r\nEgypt containing a trilingual inscription translated into Egyptian\r\nhieroglyphics. It was described by Caylus (after whom it was named),\r\nand was long the object of much learned curiosity (Inscr. Qᵃ). Another\r\ninscription was found near Suez, in A.D. 1800, and published in the\r\n‘Travels of Denon,’ in 1807. It contains a legend of Darius, and appears\r\nto have belonged to a larger monument, afterwards partly recovered, but\r\nwhich has since been entirely destroyed. It was engraved upon a stele\r\nand was also quadrilingual: having three cuneiform inscriptions on one\r\nside and the Egyptian hieroglyphics on the other. On the Persian side\r\nwere two human figures with their hands resting upon three cartouches.\r\nTo the right was the Persian, to the left the Susian, and below the\r\nBabylonian text, with the legend ‘Darius the great king, king of\r\nkings, king of lands, the king of the wide earth, son of Hystaspes the\r\nAchaemenian.’[237] Below, occupying the whole face of the stele, was\r\nthe longer inscription in twelve lines with the Persian on the top and\r\nthe others under. Nearly the whole of the Susian was lost, and only a\r\nfew letters of the Babylonian remained.[238] It begins with the long\r\nintroductory form, and Darius goes on to say that he has conquered Egypt;\r\nand commanded a canal to be dug from the Nile to the ‘sea which is in\r\ncommunication with Persia.’[239] It seems to say that the king ordered\r\nthe half of the canal toward the sea to be destroyed.[240] It is supposed\r\nthat this was done in accordance with the advice of the engineers who\r\nthought the Red Sea was above the level of the Mediterranean (Inscr. Sᶻ).\r\nTwo other inscriptions have also been found in Egypt: one on a crystal\r\ncylinder now in the British Museum and first described by Grotefend in\r\nhis ‘Neue Beiträge’ of 1840. It represents Darius in the act of killing\r\na lion. The king is standing upright in a chariot with the tiara upon\r\nhis head, and carrying a bent bow in his hand. Above him is the winged\r\nfigure, and in the background a trilingual inscription with the legend\r\n‘I [am] Darius the king.’ The other occurs upon a vase of grey marble,\r\nand like the one of Caylus, it is quadrilingual. It was first made\r\nknown by Longpérier in the ‘Revue Archéologique’ (1844), through an\r\nimperfect copy taken by the Abbé Giacchetti, but a complete transcript\r\nwas afterwards sent by Sir Gardner Wilkinson to Rawlinson. It reads\r\nsimply: ‘Artaxerxes the great king.’ It is known as the Venice vase, and\r\nis preserved in the Museum of St. Mark’s (Inscr. Qᵇ). A few other vases\r\nwere afterwards found at Susa and at Halicarnassus, but they all repeat\r\nthe same legend as that found upon the Caylus vase. A short inscription\r\nof Darius, containing the long introductory form already described, is\r\nalso mentioned by Gobineau as having been found near Kermanshah.[241] Two\r\nunilingual inscriptions, one of Arsaces and the other of Pharnuches, were\r\nalso afterwards found on seal cylinders which, with the trilingual of\r\nDarius in the British Museum (Nᵃ) raise the number to three in all.[242]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nDECIPHERMENT OF THE FIRST OR PERSIAN COLUMN—TYCHSEN TO LASSEN, A.D.\r\n1798-1836.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already called attention to the important services rendered\r\nby Niebuhr to the study of the cuneiform inscriptions. The copies he\r\nmade at Persepolis were by far the most accurate that had hitherto\r\nappeared, and the scholars who first applied themselves to the difficult\r\ntask of decipherment worked chiefly upon them. He pointed out that the\r\ninscriptions generally occur in groups of three columns, and that in\r\neach the cuneiform signs are different. He pointed out also that the\r\nthree different systems always recur in the same definite order: the\r\nsigns characteristic of the first, second and third columns in one\r\ninscription always correspond to those of the first, second and third\r\ncolumns in the others. He observed also that the signs characteristic of\r\nthe first column are evidently much simpler than those in the other two.\r\nAfter a careful comparison of the various places where they are found,\r\nhe remarked that they were limited to forty-two in number; and these he\r\ncollected and published together in his Plate 23, where they occupy a\r\nposition that might at first sight lead the reader to suppose that they\r\nformed a part of the ornamentation of the sculptured staircase.[243]\r\nThis is the first cuneiform alphabet ever published, and it was not the\r\nleast important service rendered by Niebuhr to the study. Its formation\r\nwas not so simple as might be supposed, and it would have been difficult\r\nto accomplish it except by a minute study of the monuments themselves.\r\nThe inscriptions had hitherto been so imperfectly copied that no mere\r\ncollation of them, however carefully made, could have succeeded in\r\neliminating the whole of the faulty signs arising from the errors of\r\nthe transcriber. The accidental addition or omission of a wedge, or an\r\nalteration in its direction, had the effect of magnifying the apparent\r\nnumber of the letters. It is a singular proof of the accuracy of\r\nNiebuhr’s judgment that he should have been so successful in this first\r\nattempt to distinguish between the genuine and the defective letters. In\r\nhis list of forty-two signs, he has only introduced nine that are not\r\ntrue letters, including the sign that was afterwards found to be the mark\r\nof separation between the words.[244] On the other hand, amid all the\r\nconflicting signs found in the copyists, he passed over only two that\r\nare genuine: one (𐎦) is included by Grotefend in his list of defective\r\nsigns; the other (𐎵) was first added to the alphabet by Rawlinson.[245]\r\nIt proved of great advantage to concentrate the attention of scholars\r\nupon signs that were for the most part genuine, and to save them the\r\ndissipation of energy that would have resulted if they had been left to\r\nwander unguided among the inscriptions themselves. Niebuhr rendered a\r\nfarther service by separating each group of wedges that formed a letter\r\nby a colon, an idea he copied from the Zend; and the eye thus soon\r\nbecomes accustomed to recognise the complicated combinations that belong\r\nto each other. While he contributed so much to the correct apprehension\r\nof the alphabet, it is singular that he never remarked that the words\r\nthemselves are regularly separated from each other by a diagonal wedge.\r\n\r\nThis fundamental fact also escaped the notice of Tychsen, who was the\r\nfirst to make a serious attempt at decipherment. Tychsen’s family was\r\nof Norwegian descent, but he was born in the small town of Tondern, in\r\nSchleswig Holstein, in 1734. Although of humble origin, he was sent to\r\nthe University of Halle, where he early acquired a taste for Oriental\r\nlanguages. He was appointed a lecturer in the University of Bützow (1760)\r\nand subsequently transferred to the more important post of librarian and\r\ncurator of the Museum at Rostock (1789). He attained a great reputation\r\nby his knowledge of Hebrew and Rabbinical archæology; and he was the\r\nfirst to lay the foundation of modern Biblical criticism. His Oriental\r\nstudies embraced Arabic and Syriac; and he also wrote on the Cufic\r\ninscriptions preserved in Venice and London. His works include six\r\nvolumes of archæological papers, which he calls ‘Pastimes of Bützow,’ ‘A\r\nHistory of the Rostock Library’ (1790), and two treatises on Arabic and\r\nSyriac (1791 and 1793). He is also mentioned as having written a treatise\r\non Zoroaster. His opinions on cuneiform are contained in a curious\r\ntract entitled ‘De Cuneatis Inscriptionibus Persepolitanis Lucubratio’\r\n(1798). He agreed with Niebuhr that the inscriptions are to be read\r\nfrom left to right, and that the three columns contain three different\r\nkinds of writing, which he thought concealed three different languages,\r\nprobably the Parthian, Median and Bactrian.[246] He recognised that the\r\ncharacters in the first column are by far the simplest, and it is on\r\nthem that he fastened his attention. By some means which he has failed\r\nadequately to explain,[247] he professes to be able to transliterate the\r\ncuneiform signs, and he has gratified the curiosity of the reader by\r\npresenting him with a table showing the values he has found for a great\r\nvariety of signs, among which he admitted several that are defective.\r\nHe saw that more than one sign may be used for the same sound; and he\r\nassigned four each to the letters _l_, _r_, _s_ and _x_. Conversely,\r\nhe thought that the same sign might express the most diverse sounds.\r\n_E_, _n_, _t_, are given as the different values of a single sign, No.\r\n5 (𐎿). _B_, _k_, _r_, and _b_, _x_, _y_, are assigned respectively to\r\ntwo others, Nos. 27 (𐎹) and 31 (𐎴); while two different values for the\r\nsame sign are quite common. Like many of his successors, he recognised\r\na profusion of vowels, and he has allotted nine different signs to his\r\nthree forms _a_, _ä_, _ă_. It is scarcely surprising that out of the\r\nnine, one turned out to be correct, No. 21 (𐎠); and of the four signs he\r\nallotted to _s_, one was correct, No. 38 (𐏁). He was also successful in\r\ndetecting the signs for _d_ and _u_: but as his system was based upon\r\nno intelligible principle, these results were purely accidental, and\r\ncould not afford a guide to future inquirers.[248] Having succeeded to\r\nhis satisfaction in finding known equivalents for the unknown signs,\r\nand being thereby enabled to transliterate the cuneiform text, the\r\nnext step was to endeavour to make some sense of it. This he sought to\r\ndo by comparing the singular words that resulted from his system with\r\nthose of languages he thought must be the most nearly allied, such as\r\nZend, Pehlevi, Chaldee, Arabic, Syriac and Armenian.[249] He failed to\r\nrecognise fully the intention of the diagonal wedge, so that upon some\r\noccasions he rendered it by the conjunction ‘and.’ He had, however, the\r\nmerit of pointing out that a particular group of seven cuneiform letters\r\nwere continually recurring, often followed by the same group with three\r\nor four other letters added to the termination. These are enclosed by\r\ndiagonal wedges, and we now know they are single words, the simplest\r\nform being the nominative singular of ‘King,’ and the two longer the\r\nsame word with the addition of the genitive singular and the genitive\r\nplural terminations. But Tychsen had no suspicion, at this time at least,\r\nthat the letters occurring between the diagonals must be treated as one\r\nword,[250] nor that the terminal variation was a grammatical inflexion.\r\nAccordingly he makes the simple form of seven letters represent two\r\nwords, which he transliterates and translates Osch Aksak, ‘is Aksak’; and\r\nthe two longer groups he treats as three words—Osch Aksak yka, ‘is Aksak\r\ndivus,’ for the first; and Osch Aksak acha, ‘is Aksak perfectus,’ for the\r\nsecond.[251] The personage named Aksak, whom he had thus evolved, he took\r\nto be Arsaces, the founder of the Parthian dynasty; and he accordingly\r\nfound himself compelled to attribute the inscriptions and monuments to\r\nthat comparatively late date.[252] Tychsen’s efforts at translation were\r\nexhausted by his rendering of the B and G Inscriptions of Niebuhr both\r\nof which he found to belong to Aksak; but he has transliterated the\r\nInscriptions A, H, I, and L, for the benefit of other scholars who may\r\nwish to read some meaning into them. The curious feature of his system\r\nis that some of his letters actually turned out to be correct, such as\r\nhis _a_, _u_, _s_, or _sch_. But as these results are purely accidental\r\nhe cannot be allowed to have made any real contribution to cuneiform\r\ndecipherment.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the appearance of his tract, it was assailed by Witte,\r\na professor of his own university, who seized that occasion to revive the\r\nold view of Dr. Hyde that the cuneiform characters were simply designed\r\nas a fantastic ornamentation and had no other signification.[253] On the\r\nappearance of Grotefend’s system, Tychsen had the singular magnanimity\r\nto abandon his own and he became one of the principal exponents of the\r\ntheories of the younger scholar.\r\n\r\nIn the same year (1798) that Tychsen published his ‘Lucubratio,’ a paper\r\non the same subject was read before the Royal Academy of Copenhagen, by\r\nDr. Münter. Münter’s father, who was a clergyman and a poet, was born\r\nat Lübeck and died at Copenhagen, where he was pastor of the German\r\nchurch. His son Frederick was born at Gotha, in 1761, but his youth was\r\npassed at Copenhagen, and many of his works were written in Danish and\r\nsubsequently translated into German. Like his father, he entered the\r\nChurch, and became a Professor of Theology at Copenhagen, and eventually\r\nrose to be the Bishop of Seeland (1808). He was a very prolific writer,\r\nespecially upon theological subjects. His works include a ‘History of\r\nDogma’ (1801), a ‘History of the Danish Reformation’ (1802), and the\r\nlast, which is considered to be the most important, was on the ‘Symbols\r\nand Works of Art of the Early Christians,’ published in Altona, 1824. He\r\nalso acquired considerable reputation as a philologist and Orientalist.\r\nHis paper on the Cuneiform Inscriptions was published in Danish in 1800,\r\nand translated into German in 1802. It was not till then that it became\r\naccessible to the general reading public, and very soon afterwards M.\r\nde Sacy noticed it in the ‘Magasin Encyclopédique.’[254] Münter had\r\nlong been in correspondence with Tychsen on the subject of their common\r\nstudies; but the two scholars arrived at widely different results.\r\nWhile the latter invented a system of interpretation that enabled him\r\nto transliterate the inscriptions with comparative facility, the former\r\ncould not admit that the solution of the difficulty rested upon any\r\nsatisfactory basis. His own contribution, if much more modest, is not on\r\nthat account less valuable.\r\n\r\nMünter, in the first place, rendered important service to his successor,\r\nGrotefend, by sweeping away the foolish conjecture that the inscriptions\r\nbelonged to the Parthian age, and with it the misleading inference that\r\nthe name of Arsaces was to be sought for among them. In a few masterly\r\npages, remarkable alike for wide knowledge and accurate judgment, he\r\nshowed that Persepolis could only be referred to the Achaemenian kings,\r\nan opinion that had already gained the support of Heeren, in opposition\r\nto the authority of Herder, who ascribed it to the mythological age of\r\nJamshid.[255] It might be thought that the claims of Darius or Jamshid to\r\nbe the founder of Persepolis would not give rise to heated discussion;\r\nyet in the beginning of last century the tranquillity of Göttingen was\r\nconvulsed by the fierce controversy that raged between the two learned\r\nadvocates of the rival theories.[256]\r\n\r\nMünter did not profess to be able to transliterate and still less to\r\ntranslate the inscriptions. His pretensions were limited to a very\r\ntentative endeavour to assign values to thirteen characters; and of\r\nthese, four were not derived from Niebuhr’s list, and they turned out\r\nto be merely errors of the copyist. Having fixed the date of Persepolis\r\nand presumably therefore of the inscriptions, he inferred that the\r\nlanguage must be closely allied to the Zend or the Pehlevi. He made a\r\nminute investigation of all the cuneiform inscriptions that were known\r\nin his day in Europe, and studied Kaempfer and Le Bruyn with the same\r\nattention as he studied Niebuhr. He accepted Niebuhr’s division of the\r\nPersepolitan inscriptions into three different kinds of writing; and\r\nhe conjectured that the first was alphabetical, the second syllabic,\r\nand the third ideographic. The latter he thought bore some resemblance\r\nto Chinese. He saw that the language of the first column admitted of\r\ntoo many vowels to be closely related to the Pehlevi. He was, on the\r\nwhole, disposed to think that the three columns contained translations\r\nof the same text into different languages, which might probably be\r\nZend, Pehlevi and Parsi.[257] On this point, however, he did not\r\nconsider the evidence sufficient to exclude all doubt. Indeed, he said\r\nthe three columns might turn out to be in the same language, expressed\r\nin different characters.[258] He studied carefully the inscriptions\r\nthat occur on vases, cylinders and bricks from Babylon, a few of which\r\nwere then beginning to find their way to the European museums and\r\nthe private collections of Sir W. Ouseley and Mr. Townley. The most\r\nimportant of these was upon the vase described by Caylus, which, in\r\naddition to the cuneiform inscription, was also inscribed with Egyptian\r\nhieroglyphics.[259] Tychsen pronounced the latter to be Phoenician, and\r\nhe believed that the urn itself had formerly contained the ashes of\r\nhis friend Aksak.[260] Münter made the more important remark that the\r\ncharacters on the Babylonian relics were nearly identical with that of\r\nthe third Persepolitan column.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, he devoted his attention exclusively to the simplest form of\r\nwriting, which is found in the first column; and he speedily recognised\r\nthat the diagonal wedge which occurs so frequently was evidently intended\r\nto separate one word from the other. He compared it to the cypress tree\r\nthat divides the groups in the procession on the sculptured staircase\r\nseen at Persepolis; and adds that in one of the old Hindu alphabets the\r\nwords are similarly separated by a small oval.[261] This discovery, now\r\nannounced for the first time, had till then escaped the observation of\r\nTychsen, who, it will be remembered, fancied he found three different\r\nwords enclosed within the same diagonals. In order to find values for\r\nthe cuneiform letters, he had recourse to a twofold method. He sought\r\nout the signs that recurred the most frequently and that were the most\r\nuniformly repeated in the same word, for he concluded that these would\r\nnaturally turn out to be vowels. He soon identified three in particular\r\n(𐎠, 𐎹, 𐏂) that were constantly recurring: the first in almost every word,\r\nand occasionally several times in the same word.[262] In the inscriptions\r\nanalysed, he found that the first was repeated 183 times, the second 146,\r\nand the third 107 times.[263] He then proceeded to compare the forms\r\nof these letters with those of the vowels in other kindred languages;\r\nand he thought he discerned a strong resemblance between the first and\r\nthird in the Zend character for _a_ and in the Armenian for _o_.[264] He\r\ncould not find a letter anywhere that resembled the second. However, he\r\nobserved another cuneiform sign that also recurred with great frequency\r\n(𐎶), and which might easily bear comparison with the Zend letter for _a_\r\nlong.[265] A likeness between a defective cuneiform sign ([Persian]) and\r\nthe Zend letter for _i_ gave him a fourth vowel. Similar considerations\r\nled him to assign the values of _ou_ _w_ _ii_ _y_ to another sign (𐏁),\r\na conjecture that turned out to be less happy than that of Tychsen, who\r\naccidentally hit upon its correct value, _s_. Münter had now pointed out\r\nsix signs he thought expressed vowels (viz. 𐎠 _e_ or _a_, 𐎹?, 𐎡 _o_,\r\n𐎶 _a_, [Persian] _i_, 𐏁 _ou_, &c.). The second he dropped out of his\r\nalphabet, for after careful search he could find no letter in any other\r\nalphabet to give him a clue to its value. The fifth was not a genuine\r\nletter; and of the four that remained two were, as he surmised, vowels\r\n(Nos. 1 and 3). The other two were both consonants. Only one of the\r\nformer—the first, _a_—was found to be correct; but it had already been\r\nrecognised by Tychsen. The other—the _o_—was afterwards found to be _i_.\r\nHe also identified seven other signs with the consonants _p_, _kh_ (two),\r\n_r_, _r_ strong, _s_ and _b_, which he obtained by the simple process of\r\ncomparing them with other letters found in Zend, Armenian and Georgian,\r\nto which they had ‘no small similarity.’[266] Three of the signs he\r\nselected were not genuine; and of the four others the only one that was\r\ncorrect was _b_ (𐎲). His efforts in this direction were thus limited to\r\nfinding correct values for two signs (_a_ and _b_).[267]\r\n\r\nLike Tychsen, he was attracted by the frequent repetition of the word\r\nof seven letters. In one short inscription it may be found five times,\r\nand it is repeated at least twenty-eight times in the inscriptions\r\ncopied by Niebuhr. He also observed that the same seven letters occur\r\nfrequently with a terminal addition of three or four other letters, and\r\nthis word is immediately preceded by the simpler form in seven letters.\r\nHe concluded that the additional letters must be an inflexion: not, as\r\nTychsen thought, an independent word, such as ‘pius’ or ‘perfectus.’\r\nMünter confessed his inability to read the word, but he regarded it as\r\nthe key of the whole alphabet.[268] His first impression corresponded\r\nwith that of Tychsen, in so far as he supposed it to be a proper\r\nname.[269] But its recurrence so frequently seemed to discredit this\r\nsupposition, particularly as no name of any king of the Achaemenian\r\ndynasty appeared to fit into seven letters.[270] Then he assumed it must\r\nbe a title, possibly ‘king of kings,’ and in that case he clearly saw\r\nthat the preceding word must be the name of the king. Here he had got on\r\nthe right track, for the word does in fact signify ‘king,’ and the one\r\nthat precedes it, at the beginning of the inscriptions, was afterwards\r\nfound to be the royal name; but he ultimately rejected this explanation,\r\nbecause in Niebuhr’s Table A it followed a word of two letters, which\r\ncould not possibly express the name of any of the Achaemenian kings. The\r\npassage he refers to happens to be erroneously copied, for a diagonal\r\nwedge has been introduced where there should be a letter, and Münter\r\nwas misled by this unfortunate mistake. He thus abandoned an hypothesis\r\nthat, if persevered in, might have led to some result. He may also have\r\nthought that the word of seven letters was too long to be simply ‘king,’\r\nand consequently he made the unfortunate guess that it signified ‘king\r\nof kings.’ This assumption stood greatly in the way of his arriving at\r\nthe correct meaning. The truth is that the two words already referred\r\nto as occurring together are required to make up the signification of\r\n‘king of kings,’ the second being merely a repetition of the first with\r\nthe addition of the genitive termination, corresponding to ‘rex’ and\r\n‘regum.’ Münter could derive no assistance from a Zend grammar, for at\r\nthat time none had been written.[271] What information he collected by\r\nhis own study afforded him no help in the present matter. According to\r\nhis transliteration, he knew three out of the four letters with which\r\nthe longer word terminates: these were _e_; an unknown sign, possibly a\r\n_j_, followed by _ea_; but Zend could not guide him to the signification\r\nof the inflexion ‘ejea.’ The transliteration was at fault, for the\r\nfour letters are really ‘anam,’ which corresponds exactly to the Zend\r\ngenitive plural. To be thus baffled when so near the truth is a curious\r\nillustration of how completely even an exceptionally keen inquirer may\r\nfail to recognise what might seem self-evident. With the very phrase\r\n‘king of kings’ constantly present to his mind, it never struck him that\r\ntwo words occurring one after the other, and differing in only what he\r\nrecognised to be an inflexion, were precisely the ‘king of kings’ he was\r\nin search of.[272]\r\n\r\nIn this dilemma De Sacy suggested that the word or words were probably a\r\nreligious formula, such as an invocation of God or the Ferhouer, and this\r\nopinion gained confirmation by its occurrence on cylinders and bricks\r\nwhich Münter had no doubt were inscribed with magical incantations. He\r\nwas thus led far away from the true solution.[273]\r\n\r\nMünter made a careful study of the words that showed a change of\r\ntermination, and he drew up a list of seven of the most common\r\ninflexions.[274] The two last in this list are the ones added so often to\r\nthe enigmatical word he vainly sought to read, and which are, as we now\r\nknow, the signs of the genitive singular and plural.\r\n\r\nHis inquiries did not pretend to go beyond the first or simplest species\r\nof writing, but he took occasion to point out the signs in the second\r\nand third columns that correspond to the word of seven letters. Their\r\nidentification, he argued, is indisputable, for when the word occurs\r\ntwice in succession in the first column the corresponding signs are\r\nsimilarly repeated in the second and third; and their restricted form\r\nclearly indicates that they must be syllabic or ideographic.[275]\r\n\r\nThe Persepolitan inscriptions were now tolerably well known to\r\npersons interested in such matters, by the plates of Le Bruyn and more\r\nespecially by those of Niebuhr. But the inscriptions from Babylon had\r\nonly just begun to attract notice. So far back indeed as the beginning\r\nof the seventeenth century Della Valle, as we have seen, had sent a few\r\ninscribed bricks to Rome, but they had received little attention.[276]\r\nLater travellers do not appear to have mentioned the existence of\r\nthese curious relics till the end of the eighteenth century, when Père\r\nEmanuel, a Carmelite, who resided at Bagdad, gave a description of\r\nthem in a manuscript referred to by D’Anville in the Memoirs of the\r\nAcademy of Inscriptions.[277] Soon afterwards the Abbé Beauchamp, in\r\nhis account of Hillah, says he found ‘large and thick bricks imprinted\r\nwith unknown characters, specimens of which I have presented to the\r\nAbbé Barthélemy.’[278] His account excited some interest, and it was\r\ntranslated into English in 1792, and also into German by Witte of\r\nRostock. Several of the bricks were deposited in the National Library at\r\nParis, and plaster casts of them were sent to Herder and Münter. Shortly\r\nafterwards the same collection was enriched by the Egyptian vase already\r\nmentioned, which Count Caylus had discovered, and which he described\r\nin his ‘Recueil d’Antiquités.’[279] About the same time also various\r\ncylinders and bricks found their way to different European museums and\r\nprivate collections. Drawings of a few of these were also to be found in\r\nCaylus; and in 1800 Münter published two others from Babylonian bricks\r\nthat had not seen the light before.[280]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the directors of the East India Company gave instructions to\r\nthe Resident at Bussorah to secure ten or a dozen specimens for their\r\nmuseum (1797). They said they had heard that near Hillah ‘there exist the\r\nremains of a very large and magnificent city, supposed to be Babylon,\r\nand that the bricks contain an indented scroll or label in letters\r\ntotally different from any now made use of in the East.’[281] The bricks\r\nreached London in 1801, and the task of copying and describing them was\r\nentrusted to Joseph Hager. Hager was a curious specimen of the wandering\r\nscholar, and he enjoyed a reputation that appears to have been quite out\r\nof proportion to his acquirements. He was of Austrian descent, but he\r\nwas born at Milan in 1757, and died at Pavia in 1819. He early took to\r\nthe study of Oriental languages, and especially Chinese. He roamed about\r\nEurope, visiting all the libraries from Constantinople to Madrid, and\r\nfrom Leyden and Oxford to the south of Italy. He wrote both in Italian\r\nand German, and apparently also in English and French. One of his first\r\nworks was in German on a Literary Imposture (1799), and he became known\r\nin England as a contributor to Ouseley’s Oriental Collections, and by\r\na book on the ‘Elementary Characters of the Chinese’ (1801). It was in\r\nthis year that his Memoir on the Babylonian Inscriptions was written,\r\nand shortly afterwards he settled in Paris, and was commissioned by\r\nNapoleon to compile a Dictionary of Chinese in Latin and French (1802).\r\nFor this he was to receive 6,000 francs a year; but after some time a\r\nsuspicion arose as to his qualifications and industry. The result of\r\nan inquiry was that he was removed from his post, and he left France\r\nin 1806. We afterwards find him a teacher of German at Oxford, and in\r\n1809 he retired to Pavia to fill the chair of Oriental Languages. He\r\nwrote several books on Chinese, including a Grammar, a Prospectus of a\r\nDictionary, a ‘Panthéon Chinois,’ and the like; but they were severely\r\nhandled by the most competent critics. He, however, accomplished his work\r\non the Inscriptions with a fair degree of merit. He began by publishing\r\none of them in the ‘Monthly Magazine’ (August 1801) without note or\r\ncommentary. It fell into the hands of a M. Lichtenstein, and gave rise to\r\na very foolish essay, to which reference will shortly be made. Next year\r\nHager published the others, accompanied by a learned Dissertation on the\r\nsubject.[282] He pointed out, as indeed had been already done by Münter,\r\nthat the characters on the bricks are ‘formed of nearly the same elements\r\nand nail-headed strokes’ as at Persepolis; but he showed for the first\r\ntime that the system of writing must have originated among the Chaldæans,\r\nwho ‘were a celebrated people when the name of the Persians was scarcely\r\nknown.’[283] He considered that many ancient alphabets were derived from\r\nthe cuneiform, even including Devanagari, the oldest Sanscrit character,\r\nwhich was popularly ascribed to Divine revelation.[284] He finds many of\r\nthe Babylonian characters the prototypes of Samaritan or Cuthean, and\r\nthe similar Phoenician letters. Finally he shows with striking effect\r\nthe wedge-like and angular origin of our own alphabetical system.[285]\r\nHe called attention to the ancient custom of cutting inscriptions upon\r\npillars and columns, and he considers it natural on that account to\r\nfind that ‘the writing of the ancients was perpendicular rather than\r\nhorizontal, columns and pillars being much fitter for the former manner\r\nof writing than for the latter.’[286] Such at least was the direction\r\nof the Egyptian, Ethiopian and Chinese. On account of the absence of\r\nstone in Babylon, it was necessary to substitute bricks, and we learn\r\nfrom Clement of Alexandria that Democritus took his treatise on Morals\r\nfrom an inscription written on a brick column.[287] The columnar origin\r\nof writing is perhaps the reason that the inscription on the Babylonian\r\nbricks is, as Hager asserts, ‘perpendicular rather than horizontal,’\r\nan opinion he thinks he can prove by the gems he has studied. Various\r\nconjectures as to the subject of the legend on the bricks had been put\r\nforward. Münter and Grotefend thought it was a talisman;[288] others that\r\nit recorded some historical event or an astronomical observation; but\r\nHager suggested that the subject was probably the same as that on the\r\nRoman bricks: that is to say, that it recorded the name and the place of\r\nthe maker—a suggestion that turned out to be very nearly correct. He had\r\nno doubt that the writing was the same as that discussed by Democritus\r\nin his lost treatise, and which is referred to by many of the classical\r\nwriters.[289] He considers that it is ideographic, ‘for we find single\r\ngroups composed of abundance of nails, like the various strokes in the\r\nChinese characters, all different from each other and different from\r\nthe Persepolitan.’ Nor does he consider that they were developed from\r\nhieroglyphics, but deliberately ‘formed and combined by an arbitrary\r\ninstitution, and designed to express, not letters nor syllables, but\r\neither whole sentences or whole words.’[290] Finally he suggests that the\r\nPersepolitan mode of writing was directly derived from the Babylonian\r\nby simply laying the perpendicular inscription upon its side; by that\r\nmeans the heads of the wedges that were originally at the top are now all\r\nturned to the left, and the inscription that was originally read from top\r\nto bottom becomes by its changed position always read from left to right.\r\n‘If we turn our perpendicular characters in such a manner as to make them\r\nlie in a horizontal direction, the effect will be exactly what takes\r\nplace in the Persian writing.’[291] This is a remarkable anticipation of\r\na much later discovery.\r\n\r\nHager’s book was still going through the press when another important\r\ninscription was added to the Paris Library (1802). It is on a stone\r\nfound by M. Michaux at Tak Kasra below Bagdad. The Vase of Caylus and\r\nthe Caillou Michaux continued for a time to be the two most celebrated\r\nsamples of the Persepolitan and Babylonian styles in Europe. Later on,\r\nthe Persepolitan collection was enriched by the discovery of the ‘Suez\r\nStone,’ published in the ‘Travels of Denon,’ in 1807. But all these were\r\nentirely eclipsed by the long inscription found at Babylon and sent\r\nby Sir Harford Jones to the India House. It was long known simply as\r\nthe India House Inscription, till later knowledge proved it to be the\r\nStandard Inscription of Nebuchadnezzar. Shortly afterwards (1808) the\r\nLibrary of Trinity College, Cambridge, received an inscription from Sir\r\nJohn Malcolm of which we hear little till a much later period.\r\n\r\nWe have said that an inscription published by Hager without commentary\r\nin 1801 fell into the hands of Lichtenstein, who made it the subject\r\nof a Memoir published in the ‘Brunswick Magazine.’[292] This eccentric\r\nwriter put forward the theory that the bricks concerning which so much\r\nnoise was being made were in fact not older than the seventh or eighth\r\ncentury A.D., and that the characters bore a ‘striking resemblance’ to\r\nCufic.[293] Nothing more was necessary than to remove the arbitrary\r\nadditions of unnecessary wedges, in order to detect the Cufic symbols\r\nthey concealed. Unlike most other scholars, he chiefly studied the\r\nBabylonian bricks and the most complicated of the Persepolitan systems;\r\nand he regarded an entire group of characters as only one letter. Having\r\nreduced it to the necessary simplicity by simply dropping out all the\r\ninconvenient wedges till he could discover something that suggested the\r\nappearance of a Cufic letter, he was enabled to draw up an alphabet by\r\nwhich he read all the cuneiform inscriptions with the greatest ease.[294]\r\nHe then discovered that the language was an ancient form of Arabic and\r\nshould be read from right to left. He was quite surprised that Hager\r\nshould have been so deluded by wild dreams of Belus and Semiramis that he\r\nfailed to see that his bricks ‘contained only a few miserable sentences\r\nin Arabic.’ What the Arabic words really were he did not consider it\r\nnecessary to disclose to the public, but he communicated a few of them to\r\nDe Sacy, who pronounced that they were not Arabic at all. Lichtenstein\r\nwas good enough to translate Hager’s brick, and found that it was a\r\nprayer; from thence he passed on to Niebuhr’s inscriptions, and selected\r\nthe difficult specimens (C, E, and L, Pl. 24). From C he obtained the\r\nmost astonishing result. The words ran as follows: ‘The King, the\r\nSovereign, Prince of all Princes, the Lord Saleh, Jinghis, son of\r\nArmerib, governor-general for the Emperor of China, Orkhan Saheb.’[295]\r\nEncouraged by this striking success, he next took in hand the long\r\ninscription on the Caillou Michaux. It was written, he says, in Armenian,\r\nand contains an exhortation addressed by a priest of the ‘Temple of the\r\nGod of the Dead’ to certain women mourning their departed friends.[296]\r\nDe Sacy, from whom our information is taken, gives more than a page of\r\nthis pious effusion, which he says is not more than a sixth part of the\r\ntranslation. It is needless to say that the whole is a pure invention.\r\nIndeed it does not clearly appear whether the Memoir was intended by\r\nLichtenstein as a _jeu d’esprit_, or whether it was simply an impudent\r\nimposture. It is certainly curious that he succeeded in getting himself\r\ntreated seriously. Besides the solemn review and confutation by De Sacy\r\nfrom which we quote, we find so late as 1820 that Grotefend still thought\r\nit necessary to combat his theories, and De Sacy even at that period\r\nclassified together ‘the conjectures of Lichtenstein and the labours of\r\nGrotefend’ as equally open to suspicion.[297]\r\n\r\nWe now come to the scholar to whose ingenuity we owe the first real\r\nsuccess that was achieved in deciphering the cuneiform letters.\r\n\r\nGeorge Frederick Grotefend was born at Münden, Hanover, in 1775. He\r\nwas sent to the University of Göttingen in 1795, where two years later\r\nhe obtained a tutorship. He applied himself to the study of philology\r\nunder Heyne, and in 1803 he became Pro-Rector. Soon afterwards he was\r\ntransferred to the Gymnasium of Frankfort on the Maine; and in 1821 he\r\nbecame Rector of the Lyceum at Hanover, where he died in 1853. He was\r\nalways an industrious student, but he failed in after life to follow up\r\nhis first great success; and if it had not been for it, his name would\r\nprobably never have been known. In 1817 he published a Latin Grammar,\r\nwhich was translated into English under the supervision of Dr. Arnold;\r\nand subsequently he did some useful service by his inquiries into the\r\nearly Italian languages. In 1835 he published a book on the Rudiments of\r\nthe Umbrian, and, in 1837, another on the Oscan, and these were followed\r\nin 1840 by a Geography and History of Ancient Italy. The paper on the\r\nCuneiform Inscriptions that first brought him into notice was read before\r\nthe Göttingen Academy on September 4, 1802; and, curiously enough, at the\r\nsame sitting Heyne first called attention to the Greek inscription on the\r\nRosetta Stone, from which the reading of Egyptian hieroglyphics takes its\r\ndeparture.[298]\r\n\r\nGrotefend himself informs us that he had no special knowledge of Oriental\r\nlanguages,[299] and many of his critics, who were probably quite as\r\nignorant as himself, took care that the fact should not be forgotten.\r\nAlthough he had no special qualification in this respect for the task\r\nhe undertook, yet he early displayed a remarkable aptitude for the\r\nsolution of riddles: a peculiar talent which he shared in common with\r\nDr. Hincks, who also acquired great distinction as a cuneiform scholar.\r\nIn consequence of this peculiarity a friend induced him to turn his\r\nattention to Niebuhr’s enigmatical inscriptions, which were then exciting\r\nvery general curiosity;[300] and he now disclosed the result to the\r\nAcademy. He communicated the substance of it to the ‘Göttingen Literary\r\nGazette’ (Sept. 18, 1802); and in the following year Silvestre de Sacy,\r\nthe well-known Arabic scholar, gave a full account of it in the ‘Magasin\r\nEncyclopédique’ of Millin.[301] It was subsequently reported in the\r\nwell-known Vienna periodical, the ‘Fundgruben des Orients’;[302] and in\r\n1815 Grotefend had the opportunity of explaining the matter in his own\r\nwords in an appendix to Heeren’s ‘Historical Researches.’[303]\r\n\r\nThe careful investigations of Münter were found of great service by\r\nhis more successful follower. Münter had already pointed out that the\r\ninscriptions belonged without doubt to the period of the Achaemenian\r\ndynasty; that the words were separated from each other by a diagonal\r\nwedge, and that the writing ran from left to right. He had directed\r\nspecial attention to the word of seven letters, and to the fact that it\r\npreceded in many cases another identical to it but terminating with some\r\nunknown grammatical inflexion. He had suggested that the former probably\r\nsignified some such title as ‘king of kings’ and that the royal name must\r\nbe looked for in the word that precedes it, an opinion he only abandoned\r\nin view of the difficulties already explained.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of the inquiry when Grotefend entered upon it. The\r\nMemoirs on the Antiquities of Persia, published by M. de Sacy in 1793,\r\nafforded a sort of text-book to the decipherer. De Sacy had succeeded\r\nin reading some inscriptions at Naksh-i-Rustam, written in Pehlevi.\r\nLike those at Persepolis, they were engraved above the sculptured\r\nrepresentations of kings, and they were found to contain the royal name\r\nand title. Grotefend inferred that the cuneiform inscriptions had very\r\nprobably served as models for these later legends. The simplest of\r\nthese and, from its brevity, the one that afforded the most striking\r\nresemblance to the B and G of Niebuhr ran: ‘N N rex magnus rex regum\r\n[rex-um] Filius ... [regis] stirps Achaemenis[?]’[304] The first step\r\nGrotefend made in advance of his predecessor was to perceive that it\r\nrequired two words to make up the phrase ‘king of kings,’ and that these\r\ntwo words no doubt corresponded to the two in the cuneiform: the one with\r\nseven letters and the longer form of the same word that followed it. This\r\napparently obvious necessity had, as we have seen, wholly escaped Münter.\r\nWhen it was once recognised that the word of seven letters was clearly\r\n‘king,’ it became obvious that, according to the analogy of the Pehlevi\r\nmodel, the first word of the inscription was the name of the sovereign,\r\nthe third a qualifying title corresponding to ‘magnus’ and the two\r\nfollowing, where he found the word of seven letters again repeated, and\r\non this occasion followed by the longer form, evidently corresponded to\r\n‘rex’ and ‘rex-um’ (‘regum’).\r\n\r\nComparing the two inscriptions (B and G), he found they began with\r\ndifferent words, which he now inferred were the names of two different\r\nkings; but he observed that the name in B, which was presumably in the\r\nnominative case, also occurred in the third line of G with a case-ending,\r\nfollowed by the word for ‘king.’ also with a case-ending. The termination\r\ndiffered from that already observed in the phrase ‘king of kings,’ and\r\nit marked, no doubt, the genitive singular, as the other denoted the\r\ngenitive plural. Referring to his Pehlevi model, he inferred that the\r\npassage indicated the relationship of the two monarchs, and that the king\r\nof the second inscription (G) here declared himself to be the son of the\r\nking of the first inscription (B). This little bit of ingenuity solved\r\nthe whole mystery. In the corresponding place in B he found another word\r\nin the genitive case, which was no doubt the name of the father of the\r\nking of that inscription; and he remarked that this name was not followed\r\nby the royal title. He had thus discovered the cuneiform signs that,\r\nwith little doubt, expressed the names of three Achaemenian princes,\r\nand he had recognised that these personages stood to each other in the\r\nrelation of father, son and grandson, and that the first was probably not\r\nof royal rank. That is to say, from ‘G’ he found that ‘King Z’ was son\r\nof ‘King Y’; and from ‘B’ he found that ‘King Y’ was son of ‘X’ without\r\nthe addition of ‘King.’ It only remained to determine who these three\r\nprinces were most likely to be: and as the Achaemenian dynasty was a\r\nshort one and their names already known from history, the task was not a\r\ndifficult one. The two kings at the head of the inscriptions could not\r\nbe Cyrus and Cambyses, because their names did not begin with the same\r\ncuneiform letter; they could not be Cyrus and Artaxerxes, because there\r\nis no such discrepancy in the length of the cuneiform words. There thus\r\nonly remained Darius and Xerxes for the names occurring first in the two\r\ninscriptions; and this result was confirmed by the absence of the royal\r\ntitle from the name of the father of the king in one of the inscriptions,\r\nfor he recollected that Hystaspes is not called king by the Greek\r\nwriters. He assumed, therefore, that the first word in B was Darius (and\r\nit must have been satisfactory to notice that the second letter, _a_, was\r\nprecisely the _a_ of Münter) and the other Hystaspes; while the first\r\nword in G he assumed was Xerxes.\r\n\r\nFrom these three known words he now set himself to get at least the\r\napproximate values for the letters they contained. According to De Sacy,\r\nGrotefend first transliterated Darius and then Xerxes, from which two\r\nnames he obtained the word for ‘king,’ and finally he transliterated\r\nHystaspes. But according to Grotefend’s own account of the matter, he\r\nfastened in the first instance on the word that should read ‘Hystaspes.’\r\nIt consists of ten cuneiform signs, including the inflexion. He learned\r\nfrom Anquetil’s Zend-Avesta that the Zend form of the name was Goshtasp,\r\nGustasp, Kistasp. Placing a letter of the name under each cuneiform sign,\r\nhe arrived at the following result:\r\n\r\n  𐎻 · 𐎡 · 𐏁 · 𐎫 · 𐎠 · 𐎿 · 𐎱·\r\n  _G_ _o_ _sh_ _t_ _a_ _s_ _p_.\r\n\r\nHere, then, were seven letters of the cuneiform alphabet for which\r\nvalues were provisionally assigned and three left over for the genitive\r\ntermination. The word for Darius also consisted of seven letters, which\r\nhe at first read thus:\r\n\r\n  𐎭 · 𐎠 · 𐎼 · 𐎹 · 𐎺 · 𐎢 · 𐏁·\r\n  _D_ _a_ _r_ —   — _u_ _sh_.\r\n\r\nThe process so far was confirmed by the repetition of the same letters\r\n_a_ and _sh_ in both words in the position in which they were to be\r\nexpected. There was more difficulty with Xerxes. The cuneiform word\r\nconsisted of seven letters:\r\n\r\n  𐎧 · 𐏁 · 𐎷 · 𐎠 · 𐎲 · 𐏁 · 𐎠\r\n  — _sh_ — _e_ _r_[305] _sh_ _e_\r\n\r\nof which he already knew, or guessed, five, and these known values\r\noccurred in the order he expected; the first and third letters remained\r\nto be determined. It happens that Herodotus mentions that the name of\r\nXerxes corresponded in sound to that of the Persian for ‘warrior’ or\r\n‘king’; and Grotefend noted that the first two letters in the words for\r\n‘Xerxes’ and ‘king’ were the same in the inscriptions. He ascertained\r\nthat the Greek letter ξ transliterates the Zend ‘kshe’; but he could\r\nfind nothing in the Zend vocabulary under ‘kshe.’ There were, however,\r\nseveral forms under ‘kh,’ ‘sh,’ which left no doubt that the first letter\r\nrequired should be read ‘kh.’ This assumption also enabled him to read\r\nthe word for ‘king’ which had so long attracted attention. Of the seven\r\nletters that composed it he now knew four, which occurred in the order\r\n\r\n  𐎧 · 𐏁 · 𐎠 · 𐎹 · 𐎰 · 𐎡 · 𐎹.\r\n  _kh_ _sh_ _e_ — — _o_ —.\r\n\r\nThe Zend word for ‘king,’ ‘khsheio,’ corresponds almost exactly to the\r\nform thus reached,[306] and it enabled him to add _i_ conjecturally to\r\nhis alphabet (𐎰). No explanation of the third letter in ‘Xerxes’ had yet\r\npresented itself; but it nearly resembled the fourth and seventh in the\r\nword for ‘king,’ and the fourth in the signs for ‘Darius’; and Grotefend\r\npresumed—erroneously, as it turned out—that they were the same. He\r\nobserved that in Zend the aspirate is sometimes left out, and he thought\r\nthe Zend _kh_ _sh_ _e_ _i_ _o_ might very well be supposed occasionally\r\nto take an _h_. He accordingly conjectured that this was the value of the\r\nunknown letter, and he read _kh_ _sh_ _e_ h _i_ _o_ h for ‘king,’ _kh_\r\n_sh_ h _e_ _r_ _sh_ _e_ for ‘Xerxes,’ and _D_ _a_ _r_ _h_ _e_ _u_ _sh_\r\nfor ‘Darius.’ It was not, therefore, till this point had been reached\r\nthat he completed ‘Darius’ by the addition of _h_. He was led to decide\r\nfor _e_ as the value of the fifth letter, 𐎺, by the pronunciation of\r\nthe name of Darius in Hebrew.[307] The form for Xerxes must have seemed\r\nat first sight rather disconcerting; but by the time the Appendix was\r\nrepublished, in 1824, Grotefend was able to announce that his conjecture\r\nwas fully confirmed by Champollion, who spelt out the hieroglyphics for\r\nXerxes on the Vase of Caylus to read _Kh_ _sh_ _h_ _a_ _r_ _sh_ _a_.\r\n\r\nThe result of his labours on the three proper names was that he arrived\r\nat the values of thirteen cuneiform signs: _G_ _o_ _sh_ _t_ _a_ _s_ _p_\r\nfrom Goshtasp or Hystaspes; _D_ _r_ _e_ _u_ from Darius, and _kh_ and _h_\r\nfrom Xerxes. Of these thirteen letters, nine turned out ultimately to be\r\ncorrect; but the _a_ had been previously recognised by Tychsen and by\r\nMünter: so that Grotefend now added eight correct values to the cuneiform\r\nalphabet, viz. _sh_ _t_ _s_ _p_—_d_ _r_ _u_—_kh_.\r\n\r\nHe did not, however, rest satisfied with this achievement. He sought to\r\ntransliterate and translate the remainder of the two inscriptions, but in\r\nthis his fortune failed him. He does not explain in his own Memoir the\r\nmethod he pursued, but de Sacy has given us an insight into the process\r\nwhich no doubt rests on good authority.[308] We may suppose that he kept\r\nthe Pehlevi inscription before him and continued to be guided by its\r\nanalogy. He accordingly expected to find that the word after ‘king’ would\r\nexpress some honorary epithet corresponding to ‘magnus’ in the example\r\nbefore him. It was in fact composed of four letters of which he already\r\nknew the first and third, _e_ — _r_ —. The nearest word in Zend to suit\r\nhis purpose was _e_ _gh_ _r_ _e_, ‘strong.’ He therefore considered\r\nhimself entitled to add a _gh_ and another _e_ to his list—both wrong.\r\n\r\nSo also in the position in the cuneiform where he should expect to find\r\na word corresponding to the one translated ‘stirps,’ in the Pehlevi\r\nhe observed a word of three letters of which he knew the first two,\r\n_p_, _u_ —. He hit upon a word in Pehlevi—_bun_—that had precisely the\r\nsignification of ‘stirps.’[309] So he gave his _p_ the alternate value\r\nof _b_, and added _n_ to his list. These also were both wrong. His\r\nattention was next turned to the two different inflexions which had been\r\nremarked at the end of ‘king.’ In the one consisting of three signs, he\r\nalready knew the two last, — _h_ _a_, and, for some reason we have not\r\nfound explained, he assumed the first (𐏃) was a second sign for _a_.\r\nIn this addition to his alphabet he was nearly right, for the letter\r\nhas the value of _h_ before _a_, _i_, _u_. In the second inflexion of\r\nfour letters the first and third signs are the same, his _e_ or _a_;\r\nand he learned from Anquetil that the Zend has a genitive ending _e_\r\n_tsch_ _a_ _o_. This was sufficient to add _tsch_ and another _o_ to his\r\nalphabet—both wrong. Here, then, are six more letters, _gh_, _e_, _n_,\r\n_a_, _tsch_ and _o_, to be added to the thirteen already found, making\r\nnineteen in all. There are twenty-five letters in the two inscriptions\r\ngiven by De Sacy in 1803; and there is no doubt that before that time\r\nGrotefend had, with two exceptions, completed his alphabet, as it is\r\nfound in the Appendix to Heeren in 1815.[310] According to it we see\r\nthat he had already attempted to assign values to thirty-seven cuneiform\r\nsigns, three of which are not to be found in Niebuhr’s list and are due\r\nto defective copying. Two others occur in Niebuhr’s list, but are also\r\ndefective (_e_, [Persian], and _r_, letter No. 8), so that there remain\r\nthirty-two genuine signs for which he has now found values. Several signs\r\nare, however, allotted to express the same sound. Thus he gives three\r\nsigns for _e_ (Nos. 3 [defective], 4 and 10) besides the sign for _e_\r\nor _a_ which he generally transliterates _e_. He also gives three signs\r\nfor _o_ (Nos. 12, 16 and 23). It was afterwards found that these signs,\r\nwhich he took to be synonymous, are very far from being so: for example,\r\nnot one of his three signs for _o_ has that value, being respectively\r\n_i_, _ch(a)_, and _m(a)_. Indeed, among all the additions we are now\r\nconsidering he only succeeded in arriving at two correct values, 𐎳, _f_\r\n(No. 39) and 𐏃, _a_ (No. 41), if indeed the second may be allowed to\r\npass. Its true value is the aspirate _h_. But, as we shall afterwards\r\nsee, it takes an inherent _a_, and it is very commonly used to express\r\nthe sound ‘Ha,’ the vowel _a_ being altogether omitted. In an inquiry\r\nof this kind it is necessary to admit approximate values as correct;\r\nand in the present case the value allotted to this sign by Grotefend\r\nultimately led to the important identification of the word ‘Achaemenian.’\r\nHere the first syllable, ‘Ach,’ is represented by the two signs for _h_\r\nand _kh_; and before it was known that the first letter had the sound\r\nof ‘Ha’ it was a comparatively slight error to drop the aspirate and\r\nset it down as _a_. We have therefore added this letter to the number\r\nof Grotefend’s correct discoveries. He also observed that the word for\r\n‘king’ is often represented by an ideogram (𐏋) which, like the word, is\r\nsubject to inflexions. This discovery he, however, generously attributes\r\nto Tychsen;[311] but we have not found it in the ‘Lucubratio.’ De Sacy\r\nwas not aware of the origin attributed to it, and he has given the credit\r\nentirely to Grotefend himself.[312]\r\n\r\nSoon after the completion of the alphabet, but still before the\r\nappearance of the Appendix in 1815, he was induced to change the value of\r\ntwo of the signs.[313] One of these he now fixed correctly, _k_ (25), and\r\nthe other approximately _sr_ (40).\r\n\r\nIt will be recollected that Sir William Ouseley visited Murgab in 1811\r\nand made a copy of the inscription that is found repeated there several\r\ntimes. His book did not appear till 1821; but Grotefend had the advantage\r\nof seeing a copy of the inscription in time to include it in his Memoir.\r\nAccording to the alphabet as it then stood, the transliteration would\r\nrender _z_ _u_ _sch_ _u_ _d_ _sh_;[314] but if we follow his own account,\r\nhe saw reasons, which he does not explain, to change the first letter\r\nfrom _z_ to _k_ and the third from _sch_ to _sr_; with the result that\r\nhe produced _k_ _u_ _sr_ _u_ _e_ _sch_, which he read ‘Kurus.’ He does\r\nnot mention the change of the _d_ into _e_, but a more correct copy of\r\nthe same inscription showed that that sign did not exist in the original,\r\nwhich consists of five signs only. After he had arrived at this result,\r\nhe tells us, he came across the French translation of Morier’s first\r\nMemoir, published in 1813, where, it will be recollected, that acute\r\ntraveller suggested that Murgab was Pasargadae, the city of Cyrus.[315]\r\nThis confirmation of his own studies was certainly satisfactory, though\r\nthe sequence of events as he describes them is remarkable. Grotefend had\r\nnow contributed eight correct values from the inscriptions B and G, two\r\nfrom the Murgab inscriptions, and two from other sources—that is, twelve\r\nin all (if we admit the _sr_, really _r_ before _u_, and the _a_ which is\r\n_h_ before _a_, _i_, _u_). In addition to these the _a_ and _b_ of Münter\r\nwere known, though Grotefend erroneously changed the _b_ into _v_; and\r\nhence in 1815 fourteen correct values had been reached.\r\n\r\nGrotefend was now able to transliterate after his own fashion all the\r\ninscriptions in the first style of writing. It was quite a different\r\nmatter to translate the mass of strange words that began to pour in\r\nupon him. He had to seek for analogous words in Zend or Pehlevi, or in\r\nother languages he considered akin; and he was assured by many candid\r\nfriends that this was an undertaking for which he was incompetent. In\r\nthe excitement of the first discovery he was much more reckless in this\r\nmatter than he afterwards became, when he had more experience of the\r\ndifficulties of the task. We find that he contributed the following\r\ntranslation of the B and G inscriptions to the ‘Göttingen Literary\r\nGazette,’ August 1802. B: ‘Darius, the valiant King, the King of Kings,\r\nthe Son of Hystaspes, the Successor of the Ruler of the World, in the\r\nconstellation of Moro.’ This figures in De Sacy in 1803 as follows:\r\n‘Darius, rex fortis, rex regum, rex populorum, Hystaspis stirps, mundi\r\nrectoris in constellatione mascula Moro τοῦ Ized.’ For G we have:\r\n‘Xerxes, the valiant King, the King of Kings, the Son of Darius the King,\r\nthe successor of the ruler of the world.’[316]\r\n\r\nHis next attempt at translation appeared in the ‘Göttingen Literary\r\nGazette’ of August 1803. In the interval he had made a study of Niebuhr’s\r\ninscriptions A, H and I, and compared the A with Le Bruyn’s inscription\r\nNo. 131, which it nearly resembles.[317] The translation of the second\r\nparagraph of A he gives thus: ‘Xerxes the Monarch, the valiant King,\r\nthe King of Kings, the King of all pure nations, the King of the pure,\r\nthe pious, the most potent assembly, the Son of Darius the King, the\r\ndescendant of the Lord of the Universe, Jemsheed.’[318] The H of Darius\r\nran to much the same effect and also culminated in Jamshid. Subsequently\r\nhe attempted the inscription on the windows of the Palace of Darius that\r\nremained for so long a stumbling-block to his successors, and also the\r\none on the royal robe in the Palace of Xerxes given by Le Bruyn (No.\r\n133). He likewise allowed the complete translation of the Le Bruyn No.\r\n131 to appear in the Appendix to Heeren in 1815.[319] Many of these\r\nattempts excited well-deserved ridicule, and even in 1815 we find him\r\nmuch less eager to gratify public curiosity, and perhaps less confident\r\nin his own ability to do so adequately. He willingly furnished Heeren\r\nwith the transliteration of the texts, but it was only by special\r\nrequest that he added some of his translations. ‘If I have,’ he says,\r\n‘as a decipherer established the value of the signs, it belongs to the\r\nOrientalist to complete the interpretation of the writing now for the\r\nfirst time made intelligible.’[320] He, however, still thought he could\r\nanswer for the general sense of his rendering, though not for its verbal\r\naccuracy, and subject to that limitation the window inscription and the\r\nLe Bruyn plate No. 131 appeared in 1815. In the later edition of 1824\r\nthey are, however, suppressed.\r\n\r\nWe have now given an account of this once famous discovery and the\r\nresults that were first attained. We have credited Grotefend with\r\nhaving found correct, or at least nearly correct, values for twelve\r\ncharacters; and the achievement may be allowed to merit the fame it\r\nstill confers upon its ingenious author. Each step in the process now\r\nappears simple enough, and it is not easy for us to estimate the full\r\nmagnitude of the difficulties he surmounted. They can indeed only be\r\nrealised by remembering how completely a man like Münter had failed.\r\nYet it is exceedingly curious to consider how so ingenious a person\r\nwas baffled when he might seem to be on the point of farther success.\r\nGrotefend was harassed by the continued recurrence of the two words he\r\ntransliterated ‘Bun Akeotscheschoh.’ There was, of course, no punctuation\r\nto guide the translator, and he constantly connected these two words\r\ntogether. His translation usually ran: ‘Darii regis [filius] stirps\r\nmundi rectoris.’[321] He was quite satisfied from the beginning that\r\n‘bun’ signified ‘stirps,’ and in the Pehlevi inscription, which was his\r\nconstant model, he had before him the very appropriate reading ‘stirps\r\nAchaemenis.’ No phrase, he well knew, was more likely to appear in these\r\ninscriptions than this very one. He had already arrived at the first\r\nthree letters of this word, _a_, _k_, _e_ or _a_, and it is strange the\r\nsuspicion never entered his mind that the rest of his transliteration\r\nshould be modified in accordance with the apparently inevitable\r\nconclusion that the mysterious word was in fact ‘Achaemenian.’ This is\r\nall the more remarkable from another consideration. De Sacy had expressly\r\nexhorted him to keep a look out for ‘Ormuzd,’ which was certain to occur\r\nfrequently in the cuneiform, as it did in the Sassanian inscriptions. In\r\nthe Le Bruyn No. 131 he found a word which, according to his alphabet\r\nread ‘euroghde’; and in this with singular acuteness he fancied he\r\ndetected some trace of Ormuzd.[322] But he identified the first portion\r\nof the word with the Zend of Anquetil ‘éhoré,’ and read for the whole\r\n‘Oromasdis cultor.’[323] Yet, according to his own transliteration the\r\nword gave him _a_ _u_ _r_ . . _d_ _a_,\r\n\r\n  𐎠 · 𐎢 · 𐎼 · 𐎶 · 𐏀 · 𐎭 · 𐎠·\r\n  _a_ _u_ _r_ . . _d_ _a_.\r\n\r\nHe knew that a vowel may be omitted; and it is certainly strange that\r\nhe never suspected that the two intervening letters might express\r\n‘muz,’ and the whole give him ‘Aurmuzda.’ In deference to the Murgab\r\ninscription he had already changed his original _z_ into a _k_, and\r\nhis _sch_ into _sr_; and we should think he might have seen sufficient\r\nground in what has been said to justify his abandoning the _o_ _gh_.\r\nHis singular attachment to _o_ _gh_ prevented him from observing that\r\nthe fourth letter in this word is the same as the letter that follows\r\n‘aka’ in the other; and it is curious he did not see that an _m_ in one\r\ncase would help him on with ‘Ormuzd,’ just as an _m_ in the other would\r\nlead up to ‘Akam[enian].’ There was an additional reason indeed for his\r\nchanging his _o_ into _m_, for he knew that (according to Anquetil) _m_\r\nwas the sign of the accusative—a form from which he was forced to depart\r\nwhen he made _o_ an accusative termination.[324] If he had advanced to\r\n‘akam,’ we can scarcely suppose that he would have failed to recognise\r\n‘Achaemenian,’ and would have modified his transliteration in accordance\r\nwith this new discovery. It was the identification of _m_ and _n_ long\r\nafterwards by Rask that to a great extent facilitated the way for farther\r\nprogress towards completing the alphabet, an opportunity that Grotefend\r\nunfortunately allowed to escape him.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief services rendered by Grotefend to the alphabet was to\r\ndraw up a long list of the various signs he found in the inscriptions\r\nwhich were evidently due to errors on the part of the copyist. These he\r\nascertained by a careful collation of the inscriptions as they appeared\r\nin the works of Le Bruyn, Niebuhr, and others.[325] Even Niebuhr had\r\nadmitted eight of these into his corrected list of forty-two letters, but\r\nthey existed in great numbers in the inscriptions, and till cleared out\r\nof the way, they presented a serious obstacle to the decipherer. Some of\r\nhis detractors, like St. Martin, have accused him of wilfully excluding\r\nthese signs, or of changing them arbitrarily to suit the exigencies of\r\nhis own system; but the charge is entirely without foundation, as De Sacy\r\nrecognised from the first.\r\n\r\nGrotefend was of opinion that the cuneiform system was intended only\r\nfor engraving, and that some other writing must have been in use for\r\nordinary purposes.[326] He divided the various specimens that had come\r\nunder his notice into three classes. The first included the Persepolitan\r\ninscriptions; the second was to be seen upon the stone recently published\r\nby Millin, which he says partly resembles the third Persepolitan and\r\npartly the Babylonian bricks;[327] and the third the Babylonian\r\ninscriptions, the most important being that published by the East India\r\nCompany. ‘These are the most complicated,’ and are to be ‘distinguished\r\nby the number of the strokes of union and by the eight-rayed star.’ The\r\nfirst class—namely, the Persepolitan—he again subdivided into three\r\nkinds, according to the relative complexity of the writing. He considers\r\nthey represent different languages: the first or simplest is the ‘Zend,\r\nwhich is apparently the Median language’; the second the Parsi, or\r\nlanguage of the true Persians; the third ‘perhaps a Persian dialect,\r\nperhaps Pehlevi; but in consequence of the absence of prefixes it cannot\r\nbelong to the Aramean family,’ a reason also that excluded the two others\r\nfrom the same classification. He thought the first system of writing\r\nwas the Old Assyrian; the second differs from it by having a greater\r\nnumber of oblique and fewer angular wedges; while it differs from the\r\nthird system by avoiding, like the first, wedges placed diagonally, and\r\nby having more wedges that cross each other.[328] He held that all the\r\nthree systems of Persepolitan are alphabetical and not merely syllabic\r\nor ideographic; in the first system he finds words composed of eleven\r\ncharacters, in the second of nine, and in the other of seven. On account\r\nof the number of signs required in the second system to compose a word,\r\nhe concludes that it employs separate letters for long and short vowels;\r\nand also to express the combination of a consonant and vowel. He thought\r\nthe number of letters in its alphabet was about forty, and he observed\r\nthat the monogram for ‘king’ is always used; neither here nor in the\r\nthird system is the royal title ever written alphabetically. In the Plate\r\n(No. 2, 1815) he gives three short inscriptions: the Xerxes (G, Niebuhr),\r\nthe Cyrus (Murgab) and the Xerxes on the Vase of Caylus, arranged word\r\nfor word to show the signs in the three systems that correspond to each\r\nother; and he found that the second system corresponds word for word\r\nto the first, but that the third differs considerably. In the third\r\nsystem he remarked also that a word could be formed with so few signs\r\nthat he thought it avoided the use of vowel signs as far as possible,\r\nand employed a single character to express the threefold combination of\r\nconsonant, vowel and consonant; and to that extent he concedes that it\r\nmay be called syllabic.[329]\r\n\r\nIt is a very singular circumstance that Grotefend seems to have spent\r\nthe whole of his ingenuity upon his first efforts; from that time he\r\nwas unable to make any farther contribution of importance, and the work\r\nof decipherment was carried on entirely by other scholars. Yet he never\r\nwithdrew his attention from the subject, and when he died, in 1853, all\r\nthe difficulties of the Persian column had been overcome with but little\r\nfarther assistance from him, and sufficient was already known of the\r\nBabylonian to disclose a wonderland of new and unexpected knowledge.\r\nGrotefend made a careful study of all the available inscriptions as they\r\ncame to light, and from first to last his interest in them never flagged.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen how carefully he analysed the three Persepolitan\r\ncolumns, seeking out in each the signs that might be supposed to\r\ncorrespond to each other. The classification of the Babylonian\r\ninscriptions as they now began rapidly to accumulate afforded him fresh\r\nmaterial for the exercise of his ingenuity. It seems to have been some\r\ntime before he would admit the practical identity of the writing of the\r\nthird Persepolitan column with that of the simplest of the Babylonian\r\nstyles. According to his earliest classification the three Persepolitan\r\nsystems were kept entirely apart from the two that had been remarked\r\nat Babylon. But it was not long before the similarity of the most\r\ncomplicated of the Persepolitan with the simplest of the Babylonian\r\nbecame apparent. This was fully recognised by Rich, in 1811, and we\r\ncannot suppose that Grotefend was far behind.[330] Rich was the first\r\nto announce that Grotefend had come to the important conclusion that\r\nthe two or three different forms which had been observed at Babylon\r\nwere mere varieties of one and the same method of writing, analogous to\r\nour Roman and Gothic character. Grotefend’s attention was now chiefly\r\ndirected to the Babylonian inscriptions, mainly in consequence of the\r\narticles contributed by Rich to the ‘Fundgruben des Orients,’ and\r\nafterwards by the constant correspondence he maintained with Bellino,\r\nthe German secretary Rich had brought out with him to Bagdad.[331]\r\nGrotefend now abandoned the idea that the third column was written in\r\nPehlevi. He described the language as Median Persian, and he called it\r\nthe ‘Babylonian column.’ He showed also that the many differences in the\r\nwriting of the simple Babylonian were due no doubt to the idiosyncrasies\r\nof the engravers; but they added greatly to the difficulty of the\r\ndecipherment.[332] He noted also the frequent occurrence of different\r\nideograms for the same word, such, for example, as for ‘son.’ He\r\nsharply contrasted it with such writing as is found in the India House\r\nInscription which he called ‘the complex’ (_zusammengesetzt_). Mr. Rich\r\nhad lately obtained several specimens of cylinders; two of these were\r\nfound on the site of Nineveh and a few others at Borsippa. The account\r\nhe gave of them in the ‘Fundgruben’ speedily attracted attention, and the\r\nfacsimile of one in red jasper from Nineveh was published by Dorow in\r\n1820. Grotefend called attention to the well-marked differences in the\r\ncuneiform writing that characterise these specimens, and which remove\r\nthe third Persepolitan still farther from them than even from the most\r\ncomplicated Babylonian.[333] These opinions he expressed in his letter\r\nto Dorow, and in a tract on the ‘Elucidation of certain Babylonian\r\nCylinders’ included in the same publication (1820).[334]\r\n\r\nAfter his promotion, in the following year, to the rectorship of the\r\nLyceum at Hanover (1821) other studies began to engage his time. He wrote\r\na History of his Academy (1833); he edited the fragments of Sanchoniathon\r\n(1836); and he dabbled somewhat deeply in such matters as the Oscan and\r\nUmbrian languages (1835-1838). He had not, however, entirely forgotten\r\nhis old subject, and in 1832 he attempted a translation of the I\r\ninscription, which he sent to the ‘Göttingen Gazette.’ He recognised that\r\nit contained a list of geographical names, which, however, he was unable\r\nto render correctly; but he had the merit of attracting the attention\r\nof other scholars to their existence, and it was from them that Lassen\r\nwas afterwards enabled to make such remarkable progress.[335] In 1837 he\r\nbegan to contribute a succession of papers to the Scientific Society of\r\nGöttingen on his old subject, many of which were afterwards republished\r\nin separate form. He was now sixty-two years of age, and his mind was,\r\nno doubt, less able to grapple with the series of discoveries that were\r\njust on the point of being made. In the previous year (1836) Burnouf\r\nand Lassen had simultaneously published their Memoirs on the cuneiform\r\ndecipherment that soon carried the subject far beyond the point at\r\nwhich Grotefend had left it some thirty years before. Grotefend accepts\r\nthe general results, but without much evidence of enthusiasm.[336] The\r\nreading of ‘Auromazda’ is now satisfactorily established; but he clings\r\nto his _ogh_ with unabated affection.[337] On the other hand, he suggests\r\nthe surrender of the _sr_ in ‘Kurus,’ and reads _r_ or _rh_. As regards\r\n‘Achaemenian,’ the utmost he will concede is that the Greeks probably\r\nderived it from ‘Akhâosô-schôh,’[338] and to do this he reluctantly\r\nsoftens his _tsch_ to a soft _c_ to give the _s_; but he will on no\r\naccount admit the true reading, _n_.[339] He still contends that the\r\nlanguages of the three Persepolitan columns are related to each other,\r\nbut he sees that the first, though resembling Zend, is not identical\r\nwith it. He entirely rejects the idea already broached that the third is\r\nSemitic, and he adheres to his conviction that none of the three can be\r\ncalled syllabic or ideographic in the strict sense of those terms.[340]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the tenacity with which he adhered to some of his old\r\nerrors, his later contributions were not entirely without result. He\r\ndevoted great attention to the comparison of the language of the first\r\nwith those of the other two columns, and in this task he exhibited a\r\nconsiderable amount of penetration.[341] For example the word ‘adam,’\r\nwhich is constantly recurring in the Old Persian, continued to be\r\ntranslated, even by Lassen in 1836, as ‘posui.’[342] It was Grotefend\r\nwho first observed that it was rendered in the other two columns by\r\nwords that were certainly elsewhere used for the pronoun, ‘mân, manâ,’\r\nand the suggestion led to the recognition of ‘adam’ as the first person\r\nsingular, ‘ego.’[343] The writings of Burnouf and Lassen revived an\r\ninterest in cuneiform studies, and Grotefend was enabled for the first\r\ntime to publish inscriptions which he had received twenty or even thirty\r\nyears before from Bellino, and which had lain till now unseen in his\r\ndesk. He was still regarded as the chief authority upon the subject, and\r\nnewly discovered inscriptions were invariably forwarded to him. Among\r\nthese he received one that had recently found its way to the British\r\nMuseum, and in which he was able to read the name of Artaxerxes, a\r\nking not previously met with in the inscriptions (1837). But his chief\r\ntriumph in this respect was the publication, in 1848, of an inscription\r\nof Sennacherib. The original cylinder was said to have come from\r\nKouyunjik,[344] but Bellino had long ago made a copy of the inscription\r\nand the cylinder is now called after him. When the inscription was at\r\nlength translated by Mr. Fox Talbot in 1856, it was found to relate the\r\nfirst two years of the Annals of the King. Grotefend caused an admirable\r\nengraving of it to be made on copper, and this, said the translator,\r\nnot without a tinge of irony, ‘was, I think, the greatest service that\r\npainstaking savant rendered to the science of archæology.’[345]\r\n\r\nGrotefend continued to write upon these subjects down to his death in\r\n1853. He endeavoured to keep abreast of the new discoveries in Assyria.\r\nHe was familiar with the writings of Botta and Layard. He studied the\r\ndisquisitions of Westergaard, Hincks, and Rawlinson. He contributed\r\narticles on the builder of the Khorsabad Palace; on the age of the Nimrud\r\nObelisk; on the foundation and destruction of the buildings of Nimrud;\r\nand on inscriptions found at Babylon and Nimrud. When M. Mohl, the\r\nwell-known secretary to the French Asiatic Society, visited him shortly\r\nbefore his death, he found his table littered with inscriptions, chiefly\r\nthose received from Bellino in the early years of the century.[346] He\r\nprofessed to have given up his Persepolitan studies in favour of the new\r\nAssyrian inscriptions; and he saw no reason why he should not succeed in\r\nunravelling their mystery. It is somewhat pathetic to observe the old\r\nman of seventy-eight, still animated by the recollection of a success\r\nhe had achieved fifty years before, but had never been able to repeat,\r\nvainly hoping that at the last moment he might be rewarded by another\r\nfortunate guess that would redeem the long failure of so many years. The\r\nnew discoveries were coming upon him with extraordinary rapidity and\r\nmagnitude, and he could not but feel crushed and helpless beneath such an\r\naccumulation of fresh materials. The solution of the difficulties they\r\ninvolved had passed into younger and abler hands than his, and he had to\r\ncomfort himself as best he might with the recognition so freely accorded\r\nto him, that he had laid the foundation upon which others were now\r\nbuilding; and with the assurance that the recollection of his services\r\nwould not wholly pass away from the remembrance of men.[347]\r\n\r\nGrotefend’s method of decipherment, when it first appeared, met with\r\na varying degree of success in different quarters. In Germany, as we\r\nhave seen, it was at once adopted by Tychsen, who became one of its\r\nchief exponents; and it also secured the favour of Heeren, who allowed\r\nit to share in the wide popularity accorded to his own writings. But\r\neven in Germany it was some time before it gained general recognition.\r\nThe theory of Lichtenstein, absurd as it may now appear, continued to\r\ncommand attention, and even in 1820 Grotefend still thought it necessary\r\nto defend his own opinions against those of his rival.[348] His views,\r\nhowever, gradually gained the ascendant, and in 1824 he felt he could now\r\nallow the controversy to drop; and in the new edition of Heeren he left\r\nout a large portion of the criticism he published in 1815. Since then\r\nhis merits have been fully acknowledged by his own countrymen, who are\r\nrarely disposed to underrate any of the achievements of their kindred. In\r\nEngland his system never had to contend with the rivalry of Lichtenstein.\r\nIt was received at once with general approval by all who were best\r\nqualified to form a judgment. The learned Ouseley, the more brilliant\r\nMorier, Sir R. K. Porter and Mr. Rich never doubted for a moment that\r\nGrotefend had deciphered the names of Hystaspes, Darius and Xerxes.\r\nVery different was its reception in France. De Sacy, who was really the\r\nfirst to introduce it to the notice of Europe, could never feel any real\r\nconviction that it rested upon solid grounds. He was quite uninfluenced\r\nby the jealousies that blind the judgment of smaller men, and he would\r\ngladly have given it his approval if he could have brought himself to\r\naccept the evidence. But this he was entirely unable to do; and it was\r\ncertainly not because he failed to apprehend the process by which it was\r\nreached. The explanation he has given of it greatly excels in lucidity\r\nand in logical precision the account of Grotefend himself—so much so,\r\nindeed, that we are inclined to think that Grotefend never thoroughly\r\nunderstood his own system till it was explained to him by De Sacy. The\r\nFrench scholar was fully acquainted with the subject, for he had himself\r\nmade frequent attempts at decipherment, always, he frankly acknowledges,\r\nwith a ‘total absence of success.’ The only point he considers tolerably\r\ncertain is that the word with seven signs is the title of King.[349]\r\nHe doubts altogether that the names of the kings had been correctly\r\nascertained, and he points out the difficulty of accepting an alphabet\r\nthat contains three or four signs for _e_, three for _o_, and so on. The\r\nopinion he formed in 1803 he repeats in 1820. In his letter to M. Dorow,\r\nhe confesses that he is still unable to find the names of the Persian\r\nkings or of the god Ormuzd in the cuneiform inscriptions; and he declares\r\nhe does not believe that anything hitherto published on the subject is\r\nworthy of confidence.[350]\r\n\r\nWhile the cuneiform inscriptions were thus engaging the attention of\r\nEuropean scholars, English travellers had begun the investigation of the\r\nsites of Babylon and Nineveh that were so soon to yield such surprising\r\nresults. In 1808, Kinneir visited Hillah, accompanied by Captain\r\nFrederick, of the Royal Navy; and two years later they extended their\r\nexplorations to the mounds near Mosul. Kinneir’s ‘Geographical Memoir,’\r\npublished in 1813, contains an excellent account of both these historic\r\nruins. Soon after his visit, Mr. Rich went to Hillah and began his\r\ninvestigations (1811). He found the surface of the ground covered with\r\n‘broken pans and bricks, some of which have writing on them.’[351] He\r\nwas able to make a small collection of antiquities, including a curious\r\nbasaltic stone covered with cuneiform characters, and these specimens\r\neventually found their way to the British Museum.[352] The Memoir he\r\npublished on the subject made its first appearance in the ‘Fundgruben\r\ndes Orients,’ but was, republished in England by Sir James Mackintosh.\r\nA second Memoir, written in 1817 and printed soon afterwards, was\r\nenriched by three plates containing several cuneiform inscriptions that\r\nnow appeared for the first time.[353] Rich considered there were three\r\ndifferent kinds of writing to be found at Babylon, which he divided\r\n‘according to the order of their complication.’[354] The first, he\r\nobserved, corresponds to the third Persepolitan; and in Plate 8 he gives\r\nthree specimens of it, all found upon stones resembling the ‘Caillou\r\nMichaux’ described by Millin. The second occurs rarely, and Mr. Rich says\r\nhe was the first to publish an example, although Grotefend had already\r\nseen a copy of a similar kind. It is on a piece of baked clay in shape\r\nlike a barrel, about 4¾ in. long and 1½ in. in diameter (Plate 9, No.\r\n4). The third species is that generally found on bricks and cylinders,\r\nof which he gives four examples.[355] While he wrote, he learned that\r\nthe three different kinds of Babylonian writing had been submitted to\r\nGrotefend, and that ‘learned and ingenious person’ had come to the\r\nconclusion that they ‘are only varieties of different modes of writing\r\nthe same character, and that there is in fact but one real kind of\r\nBabylonian writing.’[356] Although Rich found a vast number of bricks\r\nat Babylon, he observed that the inscriptions were nearly all alike:\r\nin fact only four different legends had up to that time been noticed\r\non the Babylonian bricks. The most common consists of seven lines. The\r\nothers are in six, four and three lines; of these Grotefend had seen\r\ncopies of the inscriptions in seven and three lines. The other two are\r\ncomparatively rare. The inscribed bricks are generally about 13 in.\r\nsquare by 3 in. thick, and are of different colours, red, white and\r\nblack.[357] They were usually found with the inscriptions downwards, and\r\nwhen they occur in a different position there is a strong presumption\r\nthat they have been moved from their original place. The cylinders found\r\nby Mr. Rich varied from 1 to 3 in. in length and were of different\r\nmaterials—some of stone, others of paste or composition.[358] They are\r\nperforated to admit of the passage of a cord, and were carried about to\r\nbe used for seals. Rich was among the earliest to recognise that this was\r\ntheir purpose; and he thus accounted for the writing being from right\r\nto left, contrary to the invariable custom. He also made the useful\r\nsuggestion that, as the language of the first Persepolitan was no doubt\r\nthat of the court of Darius, the languages of the other two columns\r\nwere in all probability those of Susa and Babylon.[359] Rich exercised\r\nconsiderable influence in Germany by his contributions to periodical\r\nliterature, and his cordial assent to the opinions of Grotefend was of\r\nimportance at that time. We have seen that his first Memoir was published\r\nin Vienna before it appeared in London; and he continued to write to the\r\n‘Fundgruben des Orients’ to describe the inscriptions he had procured\r\nfrom Babylon and Nineveh. The cylinder from Nineveh is said to have been\r\nthe earliest specimen brought to light, and it was the first to attract\r\nthe attention of Grotefend to the Babylonian system of writing.[360]\r\nIt was published by Dorow in 1820, when inscriptions of that kind\r\nwere almost unknown. Rich’s secretary, Bellino, was also in constant\r\ncorrespondence with Grotefend down to the period of his early death.[361]\r\nHe sent him a copy of the first column of one of the inscriptions at\r\nHamadan, which Grotefend presented to the University Library of Tübingen,\r\nwhere Bellino had been educated.[362] He also sent him copies of\r\ninscriptions on forty bricks in Mr. Rich’s collection, many of them of\r\nservice by illustrating slight differences in the writing of words and\r\ncharacters.[363]\r\n\r\nWe have said that De Sacy remained unconvinced that the names of Darius\r\nand Xerxes were to be found in the Persepolitan inscriptions. Two years\r\nafter he had solemnly repeated this confession, a M. St. Martin announced\r\nthat he had made the same discovery as Grotefend, which he professed to\r\nhave reached by an entirely different and far more scientific method: a\r\ncircumstance which, if true, would have afforded a strong confirmation\r\nof the reality of the original discovery. St. Martin was born in 1791,\r\nand died of cholera in 1832, at the early age of forty-one. He rose\r\nfrom a comparatively humble sphere of life, and the aristocratic prefix\r\nto his name seems to have been merely assumed. He was for a time a\r\ntraveller to his father, who was a tailor, but his talent for languages\r\nsoon transferred him from the mercantile to the learned world, and,\r\ncombined with his strong Monarchical opinions, enabled him to secure a\r\nfair amount of success. He was especially devoted to Oriental studies,\r\nand he learned Arabic, Persian, Turkish and Armenian; but his attainments\r\nseem to have struck his contemporaries as more pretentious than profound.\r\nHe was appointed, when only nineteen, to be secretary to the Society of\r\nAntiquaries (1810), and at thirty-one he became Curator of the Library\r\nof the Arsenal (1824) and afterwards an Inspector of the Royal Printing\r\nHouse, a position that enabled him to introduce the Zend and cuneiform\r\ntype. He was a very precocious scholar, for one of the writings on which\r\nhis fame rests was published at the age of twenty—‘Egypt under the\r\nPharaohs’ (1811). Seven years later his most important work appeared: ‘An\r\nHistorical and Geographical Memoir on Armenia’ (1818). He is remembered\r\nalso as one of the founders of ‘L’Universel’ (1829), a strong organ of\r\nthe Legitimist party.\r\n\r\nHis paper on the cuneiform inscriptions was read before the Académie des\r\nInscriptions, of which he was a member, in 1822, and it was afterwards\r\npublished in the ‘Journal Asiatique’ (February 1823). A more detailed\r\naccount of his discoveries was promised, but it never seems to have\r\nappeared; and the only other authoritative expression of his opinion\r\noccurs in Klaproth’s ‘Aperçu de l’Origine des diverses Ecritures’ (1832),\r\nwhere we are favoured with the latest development of his cuneiform\r\nalphabet. His treatment of this subject is not calculated to raise his\r\nreputation as a scholar; and it certainly exposes him to the charge of\r\nwant of candour.\r\n\r\nHe is good enough to begin the account of his original discoveries by a\r\nreference to the previous labours of Grotefend, of which he had a very\r\npoor opinion. He has seen the analysis of Grotefend’s system given by\r\nTychsen in the ‘Göttingen Gazette’ of September 1802, and the Essay of\r\nDe Sacy, written in the following year. These publications, he says,\r\nproduced little impression at the time, and they were farther discredited\r\nby Grotefend’s own contribution to Heeren, in 1805.[364] None of the\r\npapers since contributed by Grotefend to periodical literature have\r\nshown any improvement upon his earliest writings, and St. Martin lays\r\nit down that the contents of the inscriptions are rightly regarded as\r\nstill wholly unknown. But in addition to this unfavourable opinion,\r\nwhich was shared also by De Sacy, he brings charges of his own against\r\nGrotefend’s system that are wholly without foundation. He accuses him of\r\nfrequently varying the values he assigned to the characters, whereas it\r\nwas in consequence of the extreme tenacity with which he clung to the\r\nvalues he originally assigned that his progress was in great measure\r\narrested. St. Martin says Grotefend attributed five or six entirely\r\ndifferent values to the same character, and that he considered that\r\neach character is susceptible of assuming a variety of different forms,\r\nboth statements being equally without foundation.[365] He affects to\r\nregard the corrections introduced into the texts by Grotefend—which\r\nis one of his most valuable services—as purely arbitrary, and he\r\nprofesses to believe that interpretations based upon these emendations\r\ncan inspire no confidence, and can only be regarded as an exercise of\r\nthe imagination. He was surprised to find that his own interpretations,\r\nwhich he reached by ‘proceeding in an entirely different way,’ should\r\nhave conducted, so far as they went, to precisely the same result: and he\r\nwill not dispute that Grotefend is entitled to the priority of merit in\r\ndetecting the royal names.[366] It does not appear that St. Martin got\r\nany farther himself, and we may be permitted to doubt whether he would\r\nhave accomplished even this but for the labours of the predecessor he\r\nis so careful to disparage. When we come to inquire into ‘the entirely\r\ndifferent way’ followed by St. Martin we find that in fact it is\r\nprecisely the same as that with which we are already familiar. He worked\r\non the same two inscriptions, the B and G of Niebuhr; he treats us over\r\nagain to the analogy of the Sassanian inscriptions: the well-known phrase\r\n‘king of kings’; the genitive suffix; the position of the royal names;\r\nthe evident relationship of father and son, and so on. Our original\r\ninvestigator continues to carry us over all the old ground. He is struck\r\nby the similarity of the wedges in the word for ‘king’ and in one of the\r\nroyal names; he is guided by the Zend _khsheio_ to the cuneiform words\r\nfor ‘king’ and ‘Xerxes,’ and he tells us how dexterously he proceeded\r\nfrom this to the decipherment of the names of Darius and Hystaspes. In\r\none name only he differed from his predecessor. It will be remembered\r\nthat Grotefend deciphered ‘Cyrus’ in the Murgab inscription. St. Martin\r\npreferred to transliterate ‘Houschousch’ and to read ‘Ochus’;[367]\r\nbut in this single attempt at originality he turned out to be wrong\r\nand Grotefend right. He has spared us all the reasons that led him\r\nto these important results, as well as many grammatical and literary\r\nconsiderations which he promised to publish in a more extended Memoir.\r\nOne success he may indeed claim. In reading the name of Hystaspes he\r\ncompared it to a Zend form ‘Vyschtaspo,’ which gave a more correct result\r\nthan the ‘Goshtasp’ of Grotefend.[368] This happy accident enabled him to\r\nassign the correct value of _v_ instead of _g_ to one cuneiform sign; and\r\nin the second letter of the same word he substituted _y_ for Grotefend’s\r\n_o_, and thereby approached nearer the correct value, which is _i_. These\r\nare the sole contributions he made to the work of decipherment.\r\n\r\nIt must not, however, be supposed that his treatment of the alphabet was\r\nwanting in originality. It will be recollected that Grotefend was in\r\npossession of thirteen correct values; but of these St. Martin rejected\r\nfive.[369] The eight that remained added to the two he determined himself\r\n(_v_ and _y_ or _i_) gave him an alphabet of ten correct values, as\r\nopposed to the thirteen in the possession of Grotefend. He altered the\r\nvalues Grotefend had incorrectly assigned to nine other characters,\r\nwithout making any improvement upon them.[370] He confessed with\r\nadmirable modesty that there were twelve characters of which he could\r\nmake nothing; and this struck Lassen as being the most satisfactory\r\nportion of his work.[371] Among them Grotefend had already condemned\r\nfour as defective; one he had determined correctly as _f_, and he had\r\nnearly approximated to two others, _th_ for _t_ before _u_ (22) and _dj_\r\nfor _j_ before _i_ (32). St. Martin’s alphabet in its complete form\r\nconsists of twenty-five letters, represented by twenty-seven cuneiform\r\nsigns.[372] But of these letters he has three different modifications\r\nof the sound of _e_, which alone monopolise six cuneiform signs. Three\r\nsigns are allotted to _h_, two to _a_, two to _ou_, two to _ch_, and\r\ntwo to _r_. In its latest form ten of the letters of our alphabet are\r\nleft without equivalents in cuneiform—_b_, _f_, _g_, _i_, _l_, _q_, _u_,\r\n_w_, _x_, _z_. He was not, however, always without a _b_.[373] It was\r\nprobably not till after 1826 that he saw reason to substitute an _m_.\r\nRask had recently suggested that the word which Grotefend transliterated\r\n‘Akeotchoschoh’ should be ‘Aqamnosoh,’ and signified ‘Achaemenian.’ St.\r\nMartin had no suspicion of this when he first wrote his paper, and he\r\ntranslated the phrase ‘race illustrious and very excellent.’[374] But\r\nwhen Klaproth appeared, in 1832, the transliteration and translation\r\nwere made to run as follows: ‘Poun Oukhaamychye,’ ‘race d’Achémènes,’\r\nwhich differs from the first only by the substitution of an _m_ where\r\n_b_ occurred before.[375] This is a farther instance of unacknowledged\r\nborrowing. St. Martin accommodates himself to the view taken by Rask;\r\nbut, as ill luck would have it, he changed the wrong letter: the sign he\r\naltered into _m_ is in fact the _n_ in the word ‘Achaemenian.’[376] With\r\nthis our notice of St. Martin’s Memoir may fitly close. It is indeed a\r\nsingular production for a scholar of repute. He begins by assuring his\r\nreaders that the contents of the Persepolitan inscriptions were still\r\nentirely unknown; he censures the method adopted by Grotefend that had\r\nyielded him the names of three of the Achaemenian kings; for himself, he\r\nleads us to suppose that he is about to announce an entirely different\r\nand more scientific method. He then proceeds, without a word of warning\r\nand in simple confidence in our ignorance, to follow precisely the method\r\nhe has just denounced, and he affects astonishment that it should lead\r\nhim to precisely the same result. He can make no progress beyond the\r\nthree names already known. In the case of the Murgab inscription he\r\nventures to take a step upon his own account and immediately blunders\r\ninto error. His alphabet is remarkable for its inferiority to the one he\r\ndesires to supersede. It has at most ten correct values to Grotefend’s\r\nthirteen or fourteen.[377] Eight cuneiform letters are abandoned\r\naltogether in simulated despair. Nine are changed without being improved,\r\nand ten of the most important sounds in human language are left without\r\nexpression. We do not condemn him for being inferior to his master:\r\nmany pupils suffer from that disability; but we censure him for denying\r\nhis obligation and for affecting an originality he did not possess. One\r\nservice indeed he rendered. If he made no new discoveries in cuneiform,\r\nhe at least has the merit of discovering Grotefend’s discovery to\r\nFrance. Many of his countrymen were willing to take upon his authority\r\nwhat they would not accept from the German writer, and it gradually came\r\nto be believed (though even yet by no means universally) that the names\r\nof Hystaspes, Darius and Xerxes were to be read in the Persepolitan\r\ninscriptions.[378]\r\n\r\nThe first advance in cuneiform decipherment after Grotefend was made\r\nby Rask, a distinguished Danish scholar. He was born in 1782, and at\r\nfirst he devoted himself entirely to Icelandic. He spent two years\r\nin the island, and on his return, in 1817, he published an edition\r\nof the Edda. Subsequently he added Oriental languages to the range\r\nof his acquirements. For a time his serious attention was devoted to\r\nSanscrit, Persian and Arabic, while his leisure moments were diverted\r\nby the acquisition of Russian and Finnish. He then went to India for\r\nthree months, to perfect himself in such trifling matters as Sanscrit,\r\nHindustani, Zend and Pehlevi. A short visit to Ceylon was devoted to\r\nCingalese, Pali and Elu. On his return to Copenhagen he filled two\r\nprofessorial chairs—those of Oriental Languages and Icelandic. He is\r\nregarded as one of the earliest founders of Comparative Philology, and\r\nthe number of his writings is very large. Among them are Grammars of\r\nAnglo-Saxon, Icelandic, Cingalese, Acra, Lapp, Danish and Italian. But it\r\nis to the little volume ‘Ueber das Alter der Zend-Sprache’ that we have\r\nnow to refer.[379] Some writers contended that Zend is merely a dialect\r\nof Sanscrit, restricted in its use to sacred literature, and never\r\nemployed as a spoken language. It was also asserted that the Zend-Avesta\r\nwas of comparatively recent date, possibly not earlier than the third\r\ncentury A.D.[380] One of the many arguments adduced by Rask to confute\r\nthese theories was the similarity between the Zend and the language of\r\nthe first Persepolitan column. He pointed out that, so far as it had been\r\ndeciphered by Grotefend, it bore a strong resemblance to that of ‘Father\r\nZoroaster’; and he argued that where they differed to a marked degree in\r\ntheir case-endings, the probability was that the divergence is due to\r\nan error in the values assigned to the letters by Grotefend. Thus, the\r\ngenitive plural as given by Grotefend ends in _e_ or _a_, _ch_ (_tsch_),\r\n_a_, _o_, which bears no resemblance to anything to be found in Zend; and\r\nhe casually threw out the suggestion that it should read _a_-_n_-_a_-_m_,\r\nwhich is a usual Zend form.[381] He farther showed, in support of this\r\nview, that the change of an _o_ into _m_ would go a long way to solve\r\nthe difficulty of the word that follows ‘stirps’; and he hazarded the\r\nimproved transliteration ‘aqamnosoh,’ from which ‘Achaemenian’ might\r\nbe derived. The change of _tsch_ into _n_, and _o_ into _m_, which was\r\nat once accepted and ultimately proved to be correct, was of great\r\nimportance; and both Burnouf and Lassen admit the extent of their\r\nobligations. Rask’s own studies lay in an entirely different direction,\r\nand he made no attempt to follow up his success in decipherment; but he\r\ntook occasion to point out that there must be some radical error in an\r\nalphabet that assigns two different sounds—_e_ and _a_—to the same sign,\r\nand two signs to the same sound, _a_; and he lays down the rule ‘that\r\none letter should have only a single sound, and two or more letters can\r\nnever denote one and the same sound.’ The last maxim was not, however,\r\nverified, for it is found that some letters are represented by two and\r\neven three signs, according to the vowel they precede. He added the\r\nuseful warning that the language of the inscription is probably Old\r\nPersian, and not, therefore, identical with the language of Zoroaster.\r\nHence, while they are similar, and may be usefully compared, it by no\r\nmeans follows that the grammatical forms and the vocabulary are always\r\nidentical.[382]\r\n\r\nWe now come to the two great scholars, Burnouf and Lassen, to whom, after\r\nGrotefend, the decipherment of the cuneiform is chiefly to be ascribed.\r\n\r\nEugène Burnouf was the son of a distinguished father, who was a Professor\r\nat the Collège de France. Eugène was born in 1801, and died in 1852.\r\nAt the age of twenty-five he acquired a great reputation for Oriental\r\nscholarship by the publication of his essay ‘Sur le Pali,’ which he\r\nwrote in collaboration with Lassen.[383] But his fame rests principally\r\nupon his Zend studies, the first of which, the Vendidad, appeared in\r\n1830. More than a hundred years had elapsed since the first copy of the\r\noriginal text was brought to Europe by George Bouchier, an Englishman\r\n(1718), who had obtained it from the Parsees at Surat. Bouchier\r\npresented it to the University of Oxford, where it might be seen long\r\nafterwards chained to a wall in the Bodleian. No one, however, could\r\nread a word of it. At length a young Frenchman, Anquetil de Perron,\r\ndetermined if possible to overcome the difficulty. He went to Surat in\r\n1758, and put himself under the tutorship of the learned Parsees. He\r\nwas, however, surprised to find that, although they knew the value of\r\nthe characters, they were completely ignorant of the language itself.\r\nYet their sacred books were written in it, and they daily recited the\r\nmeaningless sounds in their ritual. It was sufficient, they said, that\r\nGod should understand the prayers they were enjoined to repeat. By an\r\ningenious comparison with the Pehlevi and Persian vocabularies Anquetil\r\nat length arrived at a probable translation; and after his return to\r\nParis he published a French version of the Zend-Avesta (1771).[384]\r\nHis work was very unduly depreciated by Sir W. Jones, the leading\r\nEnglish Orientalist, but it attracted a larger degree of esteem on the\r\nContinent, and a German edition by Kleuker appeared at Riga, in 1777,\r\nwhich enjoyed a fair amount of popularity.[385] Both the language and\r\nthe subject-matter of the Zend-Avesta began to receive the attention\r\nof scholars, and those especially who were interested in cuneiform\r\nrecognised their importance. Tychsen, for example, wrote on the\r\nreligion of Zoroaster,[386] and Rask on the relation of the language to\r\nSanscrit;[387] and the same conjunction of studies was preserved in later\r\ntimes by Burnouf, Westergaard, Oppert and Spiegel. Down to the time of\r\nBurnouf, however, the knowledge of Zend continued to be very imperfect,\r\nand Grotefend was constantly impeded in his attempt to elucidate the\r\nlanguage of the cuneiform inscriptions by reference to the very defective\r\nwork of Anquetil. Burnouf was appointed to the chair of Sanscrit in the\r\nCollège de France in 1832, and the idea occurred to him to connect his\r\nSanscrit and Zend Studies. He found that a translation of the Yaçna\r\ninto Sanscrit had been made by two Persian scholars some four hundred\r\nyears before, while the recollection of Zend was still preserved; and\r\nit is entirely due to his labours upon this text that such remarkable\r\nprogress was made in the study. His ‘Commentaire sur le Yaçna’ appeared\r\nin 1834; and in addition to its other merits it was at once recognised\r\nthat it afforded the most valuable assistance to the cuneiform student.\r\nIndeed, Sir Henry Rawlinson admitted that it was to a great extent in\r\nconsequence of the knowledge he derived from it that he was enabled to\r\novercome the difficulties of the Behistun inscription. Burnouf’s ‘Mémoire\r\nsur deux Inscriptions cunéiformes’ appeared in 1836. It was submitted\r\nto the Académie des Inscriptions in March, and finally given to the\r\nworld on June 1. He considered that the Inscriptions B and G of Niebuhr\r\nhad been sufficiently worked upon; and if additional results were to\r\nbe obtained they should be sought from fresh materials.[388] Although\r\nSchulz’s papers were not yet published, Burnouf obtained access to them;\r\nand found they included two trilingual inscriptions from Elvend near\r\nHamadan, copied by Mr. Stewart, and a trilingual from Van.[389] The two\r\nHamadan inscriptions reproduce precisely the same text, except that\r\nthe name of Darius occurs in one in the place of Xerxes in the other.\r\nComparing these with the trilingual of Xerxes at Van, he found that the\r\nfirst two paragraphs are the same in both; but the last paragraph of the\r\nVan inscription is not found at Hamadan. At Persepolis the whole of the\r\nHamadan inscription is repeated on the Anta of the Porch to the Palace of\r\nDarius; and considerably more besides. But the additional portion does\r\nnot correspond to that found in the last paragraph at Van. The whole of\r\nit was copied long before by Le Bruyn (No. 131). Burnouf next observed\r\nthat the inscription on the sculptured stairs—the A of Niebuhr—bears a\r\nstrong resemblance to those just mentioned; but the beginning is clearly\r\nimperfect. Ouseley, however, had published a five-lined inscription\r\nfrom Persepolis, which corresponds exactly to the Darius at Hamadan;\r\nand Grotefend pointed out that it was probably the beginning of the A\r\ninscription.[390] With this addition the A runs for a time parallel to\r\nthe Hamadan, while at its close it corresponds to the Le Bruyn. Burnouf\r\nhad thus a considerable number of copies of the same text, and by careful\r\ncollation he sought to eliminate the errors due to the engraver or the\r\ntranscriber. By these means he obtained a correct recension of the\r\nHamadan inscription upon which his work was chiefly founded. But there\r\nwas another to which he made frequent reference, especially towards the\r\nclose of his Memoir. This is the I inscription of Niebuhr, which is\r\ncopied from the outside wall, on the southern side of the great platform\r\nof Persepolis.[391]\r\n\r\nIt will be recollected that Grotefend had called attention to this\r\ninscription in 1832, and had pointed out that it evidently contained a\r\nlong list of proper names.[392] Whether this suggestion ever reached\r\nBurnouf it is impossible to say, but it is certain he made it an early\r\nobject of study; and from it he derived the cuneiform sign ‘B,’ with\r\nwhich he signed his letters to Lassen.\r\n\r\nThe method he pursued to determine the value of an unknown sign was to\r\ncollect all the words in which it occurred, and endeavour to assign to\r\nit a letter, from among those not already rigorously determined, that\r\nwould produce a word for which some meaning might be found by comparing\r\nit with Zend. For example, the word with which the Darius at Hamadan\r\nbegins consists of only two letters, which, according to Grotefend,\r\nwould yield _vu_. But Burnouf could make no sense out of this, and he\r\naccordingly substituted a _b_ for the first letter (𐎲). The result was\r\nthat he could not only extract a sense out of _bu_—which he compared with\r\nthe Sanscrit _bhû_ and _bû_ ‘to be,’ but two or three other words were\r\nalso rendered intelligible by the same change.[393] The consideration,\r\nhowever, that finally settled the matter was the discovery of a name\r\nin the I inscription, which, upon the supposition that the letter in\r\nquestion was a _b_ would yield ‘Bakhtroch,’ and this he had no difficulty\r\nin identifying with Bactria. Hence he altered the _v_ of Grotefend into\r\na _b_ without apparently recognising that he merely restored the value\r\noriginally given to that sign by Münter.[394]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, his method did not lead to very important results, for\r\nit only enabled him to add two additional values correctly. Both of\r\nthese were suggested to him by the second word in this same Hamadan\r\nInscription.[395] The word occurs also in the B and G inscriptions, where\r\nit was transliterated by Grotefend _e_ _gh_ _r_ _e_. Burnouf accepted the\r\nchange of the initial _e_ (𐎺) into _i_, which was made by St. Martin,\r\nwithout approaching nearer to the correct value, which is in fact a _v_.\r\nThe emendation of the second letter lay ready at hand, and could not\r\nwell be longer overlooked. Since Rask had identified the sign for _m_,\r\nthis particular sign (𐏀) was the only one that required alteration in\r\norder to read _Aur_ _m_ _z_ _da_,[396] and it was therefore inevitable\r\nthat Grotefend’s _gh_ should at length be surrendered for a _z_; the\r\nonly wonder is that this change should have been so long delayed.[397]\r\nThe emendation of the last letter of the word (𐎣) displays an entirely\r\ndifferent order of ingenuity. The letter occurs in only seven different\r\nwords in all the inscriptions of Niebuhr, Le Bruyn, and Schulz but in\r\none instance it is the initial sign in a word of which the others are\r\n_t_ _p_ _d_ _h_ _u_ _k_. It was certainly no common feat of imagination\r\nthat led Burnouf to see that if a _k_ were to precede this remarkable\r\nagglomeration, the province of Kappadocia would turn up. By these means,\r\nhowever, he got rid of another of Grotefend’s _e_’s, and altered it into\r\na _k_, which proved to be correct. Having thus changed _e_ _gh_ _r_ _e_\r\ninto _i_ _z_ _r_ _k_, the next step was to find some similar word in\r\nZend that might suggest its meaning. This, however, was not easy; the\r\nnearest he could think of was ‘yazata,’ which might bear to be translated\r\n‘divine.’[398]\r\n\r\nSuch was the method that enabled Burnouf to restore one correct value,\r\n_b_, that had been recently neglected, and to add two others, _z_ and\r\n_k_, to the alphabet. He was on the point of increasing the number of\r\ncorrect values by two or three others, but unfortunately he hesitated to\r\nyield to his first intuition. In the twelfth line of the I inscription\r\nhe found a word which, according to his alphabet he transliterated\r\n‘Arion.’[399] It occurred in a position in the geographical list that\r\nwould naturally suggest that it indicated ‘Armenia,’ and to obtain\r\nthis result it was only necessary to change the sign (𐎷) which he read\r\n_i_ into _m_. There was a farther reason that appeared to justify this\r\nalteration. In the Hamadan inscription the same sign occurs in _bu_ _i_\r\n_om_, which he translated ‘excellent’; but if it were permitted to alter\r\nthe _i_ into _m_ we should obtain _bumom_, ‘earth.’ The meaning of the\r\nsentence would then be: ‘He has given [or created] this earth; he has\r\ngiven [or created] this heaven,’ which would be an evident improvement\r\nin the sense.[400] He would not, however, allow that the alphabet could\r\ninclude more than one _m_, and he was not prepared to sacrifice the\r\n_m_ (𐎶) discovered by Rask in the genitive termination _anam_. Thus\r\nhe narrowly missed adding the _m_ (𐎷) before _i_ to the number of his\r\ncorrect values. So also in line 11 there occurs a word he reads _ayura_,\r\nbut by the change of the _y_ into _th_ he would arrive at ‘Athura,’ the\r\nancient ‘Aturia.’[401] This change was farther sanctioned by another\r\nname, which his system transliterated _pryi_; but by the hypothesis under\r\nconsideration, it would become _prthi_, a manifest form for ‘Parthia.’\r\nMoreover, the same alteration would introduce an important improvement\r\nin the word for ‘king,’ which would then read _khchâhthôh_ (from the\r\nZend _khchathrô_) in place of _khchâhyôh_.[402] Notwithstanding all\r\nthese probabilities, he finally rejected the alteration and lost the\r\naddition of another correct value. It is interesting also to observe\r\nhow nearly he approached the correct value of Grotefend’s _h_ (𐎹, No.\r\n27). He perceived that if it were changed into a _y_, it would yield\r\n_yuna_ in the twelfth line, which there could be no doubt would indicate\r\n‘Ionia.’ As it is, however, he retained the incorrect value; and he\r\ncould find no satisfactory explanation of _huna_; for he, of course,\r\nrejected ‘Huns’ as an evident anachronism.[403] It would be tedious and\r\nunnecessary to go through the other signs to which he gave new values,\r\nfor they unfortunately all turned out to be wrong. Indeed, if his\r\nservices to decipherment were to be estimated by this test alone, they\r\nwould not rank higher than those of St. Martin or Rask; for although he\r\nlays claim to have ascertained the value of twelve characters, eight of\r\nthese are erroneous, one (the _b_) fairly belongs to Münter, another (the\r\n_a_) to Grotefend, and only two remain to be placed to his own credit:\r\nprecisely the same number as were contributed by St. Martin and Rask.\r\nHis alphabet gives definite values to thirty cuneiform signs and an\r\nuncertain value to three others.[404] Following the analogy of Zend, he\r\nallots a separate sign to the long and short values of each of the vowels\r\n_a_, _i_, _u_, and in this he considers he has reached ‘a result that\r\nshould satisfy criticism.’ With respect to the consonants, however, he\r\nagrees with the maxim of Rask, and strives as far as possible to avoid\r\naccording more than one sign to each. He has, however, found it difficult\r\nto avoid giving two signs to _l_ and _h_, and no less than four to _gh_.\r\nAs regards _l_ or _h_, he introduces the second signs apologetically,\r\nfollowed by a mark of interrogation, indicating that they may be variants\r\nor defective signs. We now know there is no well-authenticated _l_ in the\r\nlanguage, and his first sign turned out to be _d_ before _i_ (𐎮) and the\r\nother _r_ before _u_ (𐎽). He was equally unfortunate with regard to _h_,\r\nneither of his signs for that letter being correct. He felt that the four\r\nsigns for _gh_ required explanation. He places only one among the thirty\r\ndefinite values in his alphabet. The others he labels as uncertain.\r\n(These are 𐎦, 𐎪, 𐎸.) He thought that a comparison of these would convince\r\nthe student that they are composed of exactly the same elements, so that\r\nthey seem to differ from each other only by the caprice of the engraver,\r\nwho has arranged the wedges according to his fancy, while he has neither\r\naltered their form nor increased nor diminished their number.[405] He\r\nrecognised, however, the objection that all cuneiform writing consists of\r\nthe same elements, and that the sole difference of one sign from another\r\nconsists in the arrangement of the wedges. He was forced to fall back\r\nupon the impossibility of assigning different values to these signs and\r\nat the same time preserving any sense in the words where they occur. The\r\nsecond _gh_ (𐎦) he considered justified by its occurrence in the word he\r\nthought must be ‘çughd,’[406] the third (𐎪) because it would enable him\r\nto read ‘baghem,’ ‘destiny,’ and the fourth (𐎸) by its completing the\r\nsense of ‘_gh_udraha,’ which he thought denoted the Gordyans.[407] In\r\nthis latter case the correct transliteration is ‘m’udray’; but it is not\r\nlikely, even if he had read the word correctly, he would have detected in\r\nthis form the name of Egypt. As a matter of fact, the first _gh_, which\r\nhe has put in his alphabet (𐎯, 34) as the usual form, is _d_ before _u_;\r\nthe second (𐎦) is _g_ before _u_; the third (𐎪, 32) is _j_ before _i_;\r\nthe fourth (𐎸, 33) is _m_ before _u_.\r\n\r\nGrotefend thought he found four and St. Martin six signs for _e_, but\r\nBurnouf correctly excluded that letter altogether from his alphabet.\r\nHe, however, incorrectly admits one sign for _ô_ long. He considers the\r\nabsence of _th_, a form that occurs frequently in Zend, is probably\r\ndue to the scarcity of documents. The want of the palatals, _tch_ and\r\n_dj_, may perhaps be assigned to the same cause; though more probably it\r\narises from the nature of the alphabet itself, for these letters are only\r\ndevelopments of the consonants _k_ and _g_.[408]\r\n\r\nBurnouf acknowledges his obligation to Grotefend for twelve letters; but\r\nthese should properly be raised to fifteen.[409] The twelve he admits\r\ninclude eight correct values and four incorrect. The three he leaves\r\nunacknowledged are _t_ (24), _u_ (36), and _a_ (41), all of which are\r\ncorrect, and they raise the number of correct values accepted from this\r\nsource to eleven. Burnouf attributes three of his letters to St. Martin,\r\nnamely _t_, _u_ and _i_: the first two are already accounted for from\r\nGrotefend; the _i_ is indeed due to St. Martin, but it is wrong. Burnouf\r\nrejected the only absolutely correct value found by St. Martin, viz.\r\n_v_. Two letters, the _m_ and _n_, he refers to Rask, from whom also\r\nhe must have derived the _q_ (25) which he erroneously substitutes for\r\nGrotefend’s _k_.\r\n\r\nThe twelve values which Burnouf credits to his own account include the\r\n_a_ of Grotefend and the _b_ of Münter.[410] There remain the two values\r\nwhich he was the first to fix correctly, viz. _k_ (4) and _z_ (18); the\r\nothers are all incorrect. We have thus accounted for twenty-nine signs\r\nout of the thirty of his alphabet;[411] the other, the _ng_ (28) of\r\nGrotefend, he treated as uncertain, but suggested _h_, the true value\r\nbeing _j(a)_[412] Besides the thirty just mentioned he gives three other\r\nsigns, to which he hesitates to assign any value, though he thought\r\nthey might all represent the sound of _gh_. These are, as we have\r\nalready explained, the _dj_ (32) and the ‘_k_?’ (33) of Grotefend, now\r\nascertained to be _j_ before _i_, and _m_ before _u_. The other does not\r\nappear in Niebuhr’s list, and Lassen is the first to assign it a value,\r\n_g_, which turned out correct (_g_ before _u_).\r\n\r\nBurnouf dropped one letter entirely out of his alphabet (𐏂, No 13):\r\nthe _n_ that completed the _bun_ or ‘stirps’ of Grotefend. Since Rask\r\nhad found the true sign for _n_, a second _n_ might well seem to be\r\nredundant;[413] and this supposition was confirmed by finding the sign\r\nwritten at Hamadan with three horizontal wedges instead of with two: a\r\ndifference that transformed it into a _p_. Burnouf accordingly thought\r\nthe other form was an error of the copyist, and he read _pup_, upon which\r\nhe confesses neither Zend nor Sanscrit could throw any light; though\r\nfrom the context it evidently means ‘son,’ and may therefore possibly\r\nbe a monogram for the Zend _puthra_.[414] He trusted, however, that\r\nfuture research would re-establish the ejected sign; in which case he\r\nproposed to give it the value of _th_, and to read _puth_. It was, in\r\nfact, afterwards found to be a genuine sign entirely distinct from _p_,\r\nand it has received the value of _tr_ or _thr_, which has completed the\r\ntransformation of _bun_ or _pun_ into _puthra_.\r\n\r\nTo sum up: of the thirty-three different cuneiform signs in Niebuhr’s\r\nlist for which values have been ultimately found, Burnouf knew only\r\nsixteen correctly (two from Münter, _a_ and _b_; ten from Grotefend; two\r\nfrom Rask and two from himself), or not quite one half.[415] Yet with\r\nsuch imperfect materials to work with he was able to render important\r\nservice in the matter of translation. It is obvious that, according as\r\nthe letters became known, and the words of the new language began to\r\nbe made out, the task of finding their meaning would depend upon the\r\nknowledge of the languages most nearly akin, and upon the acumen with\r\nwhich the interpreter could apply the resources at his disposal. In other\r\nwords, the task would pass from the decipherer to the translator; and it\r\nis in this department that Burnouf has earned the greatest distinction.\r\nAlthough he could command only a limited number of correct values, and\r\nconsequently his transliteration was still extremely imperfect, yet his\r\nknowledge of Zend, which was greater than that of any other scholar then\r\nliving, enabled him to make sense of many of these crude forms and for\r\nthe first time to approach to a correct translation of the words that\r\nwere not simply proper names. When he began his labours, there were\r\napparently only two words, ‘king’ and ‘son,’ that were correctly read, in\r\naddition to a few proper names, such as Achaemenian, Hystaspes, Darius,\r\nXerxes, Cyrus and Persia;[416] but to these both Grotefend and St. Martin\r\nhad accumulated a vast number of worthless and misleading meanings, from\r\n‘the constellation of Moro’ down to ‘Jamshid.’ Burnouf added several\r\ncorrect words to the vocabulary, and he was always able to avoid falling\r\ninto extravagant error. He showed, for example, that the word Grotefend\r\nhad taken for the conjunction ‘and’ was in reality a form of the verb ‘to\r\ngive or create.’[417] He overcame the chief difficulty in the word he\r\nread ‘aqunuch’ = ‘generator,’ really ‘ak’unaush,’ ‘to make,’ and read by\r\nGrotefend ‘florentem.’[418] The word Grotefend translated ‘Dominus’ he\r\nrendered ‘this is,’ and suggested the possibility of its being ‘I am,’\r\nwhich turned out to be its correct meaning. Besides these contributions,\r\nhe recognised the demonstrative pronoun ‘this’ (_aim_ for _avam_, ‘ce’);\r\nand he added the words ‘heaven,’ ‘man,’ ‘master,’ ‘province,’ ‘world,’\r\nand some others.[419] The great improvement in translation that resulted\r\nwill be best appreciated by a comparison. The text of the first paragraph\r\nin the Hamadan inscription, translated by Burnouf, is word for word the\r\nsame as that of the Le Bruyn (No. 131) translated by Grotefend, except\r\nthat ‘Darius’ in the former is ‘Xerxes’ in the latter. We have placed the\r\ntranslation of Burnouf opposite that of Grotefend.\r\n\r\nPARAGRAPH I\r\n\r\n  _Grotefend, Le Bruyn 131_[420]     _Burnouf, Hamadan, Darius O_[421]\r\n\r\n  Pius probus[422] Oromasdis cultor  L’être divin [est] Ormuzd\r\n  hanc constellationem sanctam       il le Homa excellent\r\n  et hunc diem                       a donné; il ce\r\n  coelestem et illum defunctum       ciel a donné; il l’homme\r\n  eumque lumine fulgentem            a donné; il la nourriture\r\n  et defuncti [filium]               a donné à l’homme;\r\n  hunc Xerxem regem                  il Darius roi\r\n  florentem summum                   a engendré ce\r\n  quorumlibet regem                  des braves roi,\r\n  summum quorumlibet                 ce des braves\r\n  amplificet                         chef.\r\n\r\n  _Paraphrase of above_[423]         _Correct Version of Inscr.

Not the least important of his contributions to the work of\r\ntranslation was the identification of the names of some of the provinces\r\nof Darius, which are contained in the I inscription. We have already\r\nobserved that Grotefend had attempted a translation of this inscription\r\nin 1832;[425] and in 1836 he again drew attention to the circumstance\r\nthat it contained a series of geographical names. The list included no\r\nless than twenty-four proper names, some of which were entirely beyond\r\nBurnouf’s power to decipher; but he made an attempt to read sixteen,\r\nand out of these eight were correct. He thus added Persia, Media,\r\nBabylon, Arabia, Cappadocia, Sarangia, Bactria and Sogdiana to the names\r\ndeciphered from the cuneiform;[426] and we have seen how nearly he\r\narrived at four more—Athura (or Assyria), Armenia, Ionia[427] and Parthia.\r\n\r\nAmong his contributions to a knowledge of the grammar, he pointed out\r\nthat the change of Grotefend’s _o_ into _m_ brought the accusative\r\nsingular into line with the Zend and Sanscrit; the genitive _aha_ is also\r\nfound in Zend, and both languages alike use it as a dative. A nominative\r\nending in _oh_ has also its counterpart in the Zend termination in _o_.\r\nHe indicated the apparent barbarism that treats the nominative case as\r\ninherent in the word itself; so that the case-ending is appended to it\r\nwithout modification, as if we wrote ‘dominus-um’ for ‘dominum,’ or\r\n‘dominus-i’ for ‘domini.’[428]\r\n\r\nHe inferred from the two words ‘Aurmzda’ and ‘izrk’ that cases occur in\r\nwhich both the vowels and the aspirate are suppressed; and he concluded\r\nthat the system of cuneiform writing could not have been originally\r\napplied to express a Sanscrit or Zend language, in both of which the\r\nvowel is rigorously represented. He conjectured also that the cuneiform\r\nsigns for the vowels might include an aspirate that rendered its separate\r\nexpression unnecessary.[429] ‘There is therefore an evident disagreement\r\nbetween the language of the inscriptions and the characters in which\r\nthey are written’; and this he ascribed ‘to the influence of a system of\r\ntranscription of Semitic origin.’[430] The discovery that there was a\r\nmarked discrepancy between the mode of writing and the characteristics of\r\nan Indo-European language, now announced for the first time, was soon to\r\nreceive very ample confirmation, though it was no small surprise to most\r\nscholars when the origin of the writing was traced, not to Semitic, but\r\nto Turanian sources. In opposition to the opinion of Grotefend, Burnouf\r\nthought that the greater simplicity of the mode of writing in the first\r\nPersepolitan column indicated its later development, and he showed that\r\nthe language was not identical with Zend, as Grotefend at first imagined,\r\nbut a dialect less pure than Zend, and in actual process of developing\r\ninto a later form.[431] Indeed it already exhibited by its interchange of\r\nletters some of the peculiarities noticed in modern Persian. He has no\r\ndoubt that it was the living language of the court of Darius; and it is\r\npeculiarly interesting, inasmuch as its existence fully establishes the\r\ngreater antiquity of Zend, and removes for ever all the doubts that had\r\narisen as to the authenticity of that sacred language.[432]\r\n\r\nWe have already said that Burnouf was connected by ties of friendship\r\nwith Lassen from an early age. Lassen was a Norwegian, born at Bergen\r\nin 1800, and consequently a year older than his friend. He was educated\r\nat Christiania, and at the age of twenty-two he left Norway to continue\r\nhis studies at Heidelberg. He obtained a travelling studentship from\r\nthe Prussian Government, and visited London and Paris in the years\r\n1824-6. During his stay in the latter capital he made the acquaintance\r\nof Burnouf, and collaborated with him in the production of the ‘Essai\r\nsur le Pali’ (1826). On his return to Germany he settled at Bonn, whither\r\nhe was attracted by the presence of Schlegel and Bopp. Like them, he was\r\ndevoted to the study of Sanscrit and the literature of India; and in\r\nconjunction with Schlegel he became the founder of Sanscrit philology in\r\nGermany. In 1829, he assisted him in the publication of the Râmâyana,\r\nand subsequently edited other ancient texts. In 1830, he received a\r\nProfessorship at the University with the munificent stipend of three\r\nhundred thalers, or about forty-five pounds, a year; and ten years later,\r\nwhen he had attained a wide celebrity, a chair of Indian Languages and\r\nLiterature was created for him with a salary of seven hundred thalers.\r\nHere he spent his life, writing and lecturing on his favourite studies,\r\nwhich also included modern Persian and English literature. His chief\r\nworks were the ‘Prakrit Grammatik’ (1837), the Vendidad (1852), and\r\nnotably the ‘Indische Alterthumskunde,’ begun in 1847 and continued down\r\nto 1867.\r\n\r\nLassen was troubled during the greater portion of his life by a weakness\r\nof sight, which from 1840 became a serious impediment to his studies.\r\nHis last lectures were delivered in the session 1868-9, but he lived\r\non to 1876, when he died in the city which partly from his own labours\r\nhad acquired the name of ‘the second Benares, on the shore of a second\r\nGanges.’\r\n\r\nWhen he left Paris in 1826 he continued to correspond with Burnouf, and\r\nreceived letters from him subscribed with the cuneiform sign for B (𐎲).\r\nBurnouf had in fact long devoted himself to cuneiform studies, as is\r\napparent from his edition of the Yaçna in 1833; but it is not stated when\r\nLassen first directed his attention to the same subject. Both scholars\r\npublished their essays upon it in 1836. When Burnouf communicated his\r\nMemoir to the Academy of Inscriptions, in March 1836, Lassen confesses\r\nthat he was entirely taken by surprise.[433] His own Memoir on the\r\nsubject was already in the press, and his preface is dated in May. Both\r\nessays were published about the same time, though we cannot say which had\r\nthe actual priority of appearance. It is perfectly certain that neither\r\nscholar was dependent upon the published work of the other, and if they\r\nhad not been personal friends, the question of the complete independence\r\nof their discoveries could never have arisen. As it is, however, we know\r\nthat in the summer preceding the publication of the Memoirs, Burnouf\r\nvisited Bonn, and had much conversation with Lassen on the subject of\r\ntheir common pursuits.[434] He told him that he had ‘deciphered the\r\nnames of all the old Persian provinces,’ which sufficiently indicated\r\nthe direction of his studies; and it is quite possible that he told him\r\nalso of his identification of the letters _k_ and _z_ as well as _b_.\r\nAt all events, his Memoir preceded by a clear month (April) the writing\r\nof Lassen’s preface, and he is entitled to claim these two letters.\r\nWhatever confidences Burnouf may have imparted, Lassen was evidently more\r\nreticent, for although the discoveries of the Bonn professor embraced the\r\nre-discovered _b_ of Münter and the _k_ and _z_ of Burnouf, they include\r\nalso several other correct values of which Burnouf had no knowledge.\r\n\r\nLassen was not without enemies, and among them the bitterest was\r\nHoltzmann, whom we shall afterwards meet as a contributor to cuneiform\r\nstudies. It appears that Lassen, writing to a friend in November 1835,\r\nexpressed great surprise to find that Burnouf had deciphered the names of\r\nthe Persian provinces. Holtzmann took this to mean that Lassen had till\r\nthen known nothing of either the I inscription or the Persian provinces,\r\nand that he had borrowed the whole idea of his book and part of its\r\nsubstance from his friend. There is, however, nothing inconsistent with\r\nthe far more probable assumption that he had been at work upon it long\r\nbefore the summer visit of Burnouf, and was possibly annoyed as well as\r\nsurprised to find that his friend had gone so far upon the same track.\r\nMuch has been said of this matter, and it has even been attempted to\r\nraise it to the dignity of a grave literary scandal; but it seems to\r\nhave originated in a misunderstanding of Holtzmann, prompted possibly by\r\npersonal antipathy, and to have been fostered by those unamiable persons\r\nwho love to sow discord, and whose delight it is to sever friendships\r\nthat are the chief joy of life. Happily, in this case their efforts were\r\nunsuccessful. It is certain at least that the friendly relations between\r\nthe two scholars were never interrupted, and M. Jacquet, who knew both,\r\nsaid that they had worked simultaneously and without communication with\r\neach other.[435] It is quite possible also that Grotefend’s previous\r\nmention of the inscription had escaped Lassen’s notice. However this\r\nmay be, we give his own account of the discovery. He tells us he\r\nwas attracted to the I inscription by recollecting the statement of\r\nHerodotus that Darius set up a column on the banks of the Bosphorus\r\nwith an inscription in Assyrian and Greek, recording the names of the\r\nnations that had followed his banner. He considered that the sculptured\r\nstaircase at Persepolis undoubtedly portrayed the representatives of\r\nvarious nations bearing tribute to the great King, and he thought that\r\nthere must be a record of their names somewhere among the ruins.\r\nAccordingly, with such assistance as he could obtain from Grotefend’s\r\nalphabet, he examined the various inscriptions in Niebuhr and Le Bruyn,\r\ntill at length he discovered what he sought in the I inscription of the\r\nformer.[436] It was natural to suppose that the nations would be arranged\r\nin geographical order and follow somewhat the same succession as in\r\nHerodotus. The names given by the Greek historian, some of which are also\r\nfound in the Zend-Avesta, would afford a clue to their pronunciation in\r\nthe cuneiform language, and he might hope with this assistance to carry\r\non the work so successfully begun by Grotefend. It was in consequence\r\nof the discovery of the names of the three kings in the B and G\r\ninscriptions that Grotefend had been able to fix the values of some of\r\nthe signs; and it was natural to suppose that the list now brought to\r\nlight, which contained twenty-four proper names, would yield results of\r\nproportionately greater importance. Indeed Lassen believed that he had by\r\nthis means found the values of almost all the signs that still remained\r\ndoubtful or unknown. Many other scholars had already indulged the same\r\ndelusion. St. Martin boasted that his system was ‘_à l’abri de la\r\ncritique_.’[437] Burnouf felt convinced that after his own labours ‘there\r\ncould be no further doubt except with reference to the letters that\r\nrarely occur.’[438] Lassen was certainly more successful than any of his\r\npredecessors, Grotefend alone excepted. He can lay an indisputable claim\r\nto having correctly deciphered six additional signs; and this number may\r\nbe raised to eight if, as is not improbable, he independently discovered\r\nthe _k_ and _z_ of Burnouf; and to ten, if we allow two other letters\r\nto pass, the _w_ (𐎺, No. 10) and the _t_ (𐏂, No. 13), which he brought\r\nvery close to their true values of _v_ and _tr_—or _ti_ as Spiegel writes\r\nit.[439]\r\n\r\nAt the time we have now reached, the forty-two signs collected by Niebuhr\r\nhad been reduced to thirty-three by the elimination of the diagonal and\r\nof eight others found to be defective. Lassen accounted for all the\r\nthirty-three that remained, and he added three others he found elsewhere.\r\nOf these one (𐎦) is treated by Grotefend as a defective sign for _n_;\r\nbut it turned out to be a genuine letter.[440] Burnouf was the first to\r\nrecognise its claim, and it figures as one of his three conjectural signs\r\nfor _gh_. Lassen gives it the definite value of _g_, which was correct,\r\nfor it was eventually determined as _g_ before _u_. The two other signs\r\nhe added, ([Persian]) _t_ and ([Persian]) _v_, were both ascertained to\r\nbe defective, and he subsequently dropped them from his alphabet. At\r\nthis period, therefore, he admitted thirty-four genuine signs and two\r\ndefective. His alphabet contained twenty-three correct values as opposed\r\nto the thirteen of Grotefend and the sixteen of Burnouf. It was made up\r\nof the\r\n\r\n   2 from Münter—_a_ and _b_;\r\n  10 from Grotefend—_s_ (or _ç_), _r_, _d_, _p_, _t_ (24), _u_ (36),\r\n       _sch_ (or _š_[441]), _f_, _a_ (41) and _kh_ or _k_—the same\r\n       as those accepted by Burnouf;\r\n   1 from St. Martin—_v_;\r\n   2 from Rask—_m_ and _n_;\r\n   2 deciphered simultaneously with Burnouf—_k_ and _z_;\r\n   6 added by himself—_i_, _t_ (22), _m_, _d_, _g_ (35), _g_ (44)—\r\n\r\ntwenty-three in all. There were also two added by himself nearly\r\ncorrect—_w_ (10), _t_ (13), which, as approximate values, may be allowed\r\nto pass, especially in consideration of the German pronunciation of _w_.\r\nNine were incorrect—_i_ (16), _k_ (19), _o_ (25), _z_ (26), _h_ (27), _n_\r\n(28), _g_ (32), _g_ (33), _s_ (40).\r\n\r\nBut it contained a peculiarity of its own into which Lassen was betrayed\r\nby a desire to press the grammatical forms of Zend upon the cuneiform\r\nlanguage. In the first place he insisted with not less force than\r\nBurnouf, in distinguishing the long and short vowels. Each of the vowels\r\n_a_, _i_, _u_ are accordingly allotted two distinct signs, and one of his\r\ndefective signs is pressed into the service in order to secure a _û_. But\r\nin addition to this his _a_ (𐏃), when it occurs in the middle of a word,\r\ntakes the value of _ang_; and in a similar position his _î_ and _û_ may\r\nbecome _y_ and _v_. Still more remarkable is his treatment of diphthongs.\r\nHe observed three instances in which two signs are seen frequently to\r\nfollow each other. Of one of these accidental combinations he made a\r\nlong _ê_,[442] of the second an _ô_[443] and of the third a _q_.[444] He\r\nforfeited much of the advantage of his greater command of correct values\r\nby falling into these errors. He, however, boldly recognised that some\r\nconsonants are represented by more than one cuneiform sign, among which\r\nhe includes _t_ with four signs; _s_, _v_, _n_ and _m_ with two each. He\r\nwas not uniformly correct in the signs he allotted nor in their number;\r\nbut if he gave too many to _t_, which has only two, he did not give\r\nenough to _m_, which has three.\r\n\r\nLassen gave full credit to Grotefend for his ingenious discovery, and he\r\nadmitted that the values established upon the authority of the three\r\nproper names were in all probability correct. But, so far as was known,\r\nGrotefend had never published any account of the method he followed to\r\ndetermine the other signs, a method that resulted in the production of\r\nwords that had no resemblance to any human language, and that could not\r\nin fact be pronounced by any human tongue. Lassen did not put himself\r\nforward as an opponent of Grotefend, but as a continuator of his work\r\nfrom the point where he considered his predecessor had left it.[445] He\r\nwould not even accept his reading of ‘Cyrus’ in the Murgab inscription,\r\nand in this his scepticism landed him in serious error. Lassen’s method\r\nwas much the same as that of Burnouf. The signs not explained in the\r\nthree proper names he regarded as doubtful or unknown, and he sought\r\nfor them elsewhere especially in the proper names in the I inscription,\r\nwhere it might be possible to determine their sound by their occurrence\r\nin a word identified as that of some well-known country or province. The\r\nresult of his special study of this text was that he made out correctly\r\nno less than nineteen of the twenty-four names it contains, which\r\ncompares favourably with the eight of Burnouf. But in addition to these\r\nhe added three that are not to be found in the original, by fancying he\r\nsaw proper names in what are in fact merely common words. His nineteen\r\nnames, however, provided him with abundant material to continue the work\r\nof decipherment.\r\n\r\nOne result of his study became immediately apparent to him. The constant\r\nagglomeration of consonants without the intervention of a vowel proved\r\nthat in some cases the vowel must be inherent in the consonant. He\r\narrived at this conclusion from the word ‘Çprd,’ which he found as\r\nthe name of a country in his inscription, and which he concluded was\r\nÇapardia, or the Sapeires of Herodotus.[446]. We have seen that Burnouf\r\nwas led to the same inference from the appearance of such forms as ‘izrk’\r\nand ‘Aurmzda.’[447] Lassen also observed instances, such as the word\r\n‘imam,’ where the word is sometimes written with and sometimes without\r\nthe _a_ (𐎠).[448] He at length laid down the rule that an _a_ is only\r\ndistinctly expressed at the beginning of a word, and in the middle before\r\n_h_ or another vowel. On all other occasions, he says, it is inherent\r\nin all the consonants, unless distinctly excluded by the occurrence of\r\nanother vowel.[449] This rule he afterwards applied more distinctly to\r\nthe short _a_ (𐏃), and adds that it is expressed when it follows the long\r\n_â_ (𐎠), never after _i_ or _u_.[450] In his transliterations he assumes\r\nthe truth of this rule, and he invariably separates two consonants by the\r\ninterposition of an _a_.\r\n\r\nWe have said that he may indisputably claim to have added six new values\r\ncorrectly to the alphabet, _i_, _t_, _m_, _d_, _g_ (25), _g_ (44).[451]\r\nThe sign for _i_ is the second letter in ‘Hystaspes,’ and it had been\r\nvariously given the value of _o_ by Grotefend and _y_ by St. Martin,\r\naccording as they followed the form ‘Goshtasp’ or ‘Vyschtaspo.’ But\r\nLassen pointed out that the correct Zend form is ‘Vistaçpa,’ and he\r\nconsequently, preferred _i_, a rendering confirmed by the word ‘imam,’\r\n‘this,’ which corresponds exactly to the Zend and Sanscrit word.[452]\r\nThis alteration got rid of Burnouf’s _(h)ôma_ (‘excellent’), which went\r\nto join the goodly company of Jamshid and the constellation of Moro.\r\n\r\nThe name ‘Katpatuk’ for Cappadocia, which Burnouf had already cited with\r\ngood effect, was turned to farther account by Lassen. He not only used\r\nit to confirm the sign for _k_ (𐎣) with which it begins and ends; but it\r\nenabled him to find a true sign for _t_, by comparison with other words\r\nin which it occurs.[453]\r\n\r\nWe have already said that Burnouf suspected that _m_ was the true value\r\nof the sign Grotefend made an _h_, and that he only rejected it because\r\nhe could not reconcile himself to the existence of two signs for the\r\nsame sound. Lassen was less influenced by such considerations, and when\r\nhe came to a word that transliterated ‘A r—i n,’ he had no scruple in\r\ncompleting it by writing an _m_ for the unknown letter. Indeed the word\r\noccurred exactly where, from geographical considerations he would be led\r\nto expect ‘Armenia,’ and the conclusion would have been irresistible even\r\nif it had not been confirmed by the name ‘Choras_m_ia’ which he observed\r\na little farther down in his list.[454] He made the useful remark that\r\nthe sign was always preceded by _i_, the full signification of which was\r\nnot then apparent. We now know that it is precisely the _m_ before _i_.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the sign for _d_ was a happy intuition, and rested on\r\nslight evidence. He found in the eighteenth line a name of which he knew\r\nfour letters, _a_ _i_—_u_ _s_, and he divined that the unknown letter\r\nwas _d_, which enabled him to read ‘Aidus’ = India.[455] This guess was\r\nconfirmed by one other instance only, where the same sign will make\r\n‘_d_aquista,’ which he thought was Zend for ‘the wisest.’ The word is\r\nreally ‘duvaishtam’ and has quite another signification.\r\n\r\nWe have not noticed how he arrived at the value _g_ for Grotefend’s _u_,\r\nor for the sign which Grotefend thought was a defective _n_. We find them\r\nwithout explanation in the place where they appear to be mentioned for\r\nthe first time.[456] The first is _g_ before _a_; the other _g_ before\r\n_u_.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the six correct values just enumerated, Lassen was also\r\nvery nearly successful in two others—_w_ (𐎺, 10) and _t_ (𐏂, 13), really\r\n_v_ before _a_ and _tr_ before _a_. The latter he correctly acknowledged\r\nin a later work.\r\n\r\nThe first is the _e_ of Grotefend in his ‘Darh_e_usch.’ Lassen had\r\nthe Hebrew form of the name ‘Darjavesch’ in his mind, and no doubt he\r\nsuspected the presence of the sound of _v_ in the Old Persian word. The\r\ndiscovery of the _w_ was certainly ingenious, though scarcely convincing,\r\nif it had not been supported from other sources.[457] At the end of the\r\nB inscription there is a word in the nominative, ‘Akun_u_sh,’ which is\r\nfound elsewhere with the accusative termination _m_, but, instead of\r\nthe _u_, the sign now under discussion is substituted—that is, instead\r\nof ‘nus,’ we have _n_ 𐎺 _m_. Now, he argued, it is impossible either in\r\nZend or Sanscrit for a word whose theme ends with _u_ to lose it in the\r\naccusative; and therefore the unknown sign must either be a _u_ or the\r\ncorresponding half-vocal _v_.[458] But in Darius, the letter that follows\r\nis a _u_, and therefore it must be the half-vocal—the only question being\r\nwhether it is the Zend _v_ or _w_. He eventually erroneously decided for\r\nthe _w_, and pointed to two other words _wᵃsna_ and _wᵃzᵃrk_, where as a\r\n_w_ it would make excellent sense.[459]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the _t_, it will be recollected that Grotefend gave the\r\nvalue of _n_ to a sign that completed the word ‘bun,’ to which he gave\r\nthe meaning ‘stirps.’ This word had long been a stumbling-block to Zend\r\nscholars, and Lassen determined to get rid of it. He showed in the first\r\nplace that the _b_ or _p_ at the beginning could not be interchangeable,\r\nand the word must at all events be treated as ‘pun’; but he proposed to\r\nalter it still further by reading ‘put.’ By this means he came nearer\r\nto its obvious meaning, ‘son’—that is, to the Zend ‘putra.’ He found\r\nthis innovation supported by another word, _k_ _s_ _t_ _m_, to which he\r\nthought he could attach a Zend meaning.[460]\r\n\r\nThe nine incorrect values he admitted into his alphabet[461] show little\r\nor no improvement on those suggested by Grotefend or Burnouf; and\r\nunfortunately the decipherer himself can rarely distinguish the incorrect\r\nvalues from the correct. A glance over a page of Lassen’s transliteration\r\nwill show the havoc these nine incorrect letters have made in his work.\r\nBut, as we have said, he introduced errors peculiar to himself that were\r\neven more fatal than his failure to identify all the signs correctly. For\r\nexample, he remarked that the sign he took for a short _a_ (𐏃) seemed\r\ncomposed of the sign for _n_ (𐎴) and an angular wedge which might be\r\nan abbreviation of the sign itself. He was led to this hypothesis by\r\ncomparison with the Zend, where _ă_ is clearly a combination of _a_ and\r\n_n_.[462] He goes farther and gives the short _a_ and _n_ the guttural\r\nsound of _ang_, when it is found before the letter he thought was _h_\r\n(𐎹, 27; really _y_), and he cites several instances which he thinks will\r\njustify this opinion. He recognises, however, that the rule even thus\r\nlimited is not always applicable.[463]\r\n\r\nAnother error, due also to the deference he professed for Zend analogies,\r\narose from the supposition that the two letters which he took for _u_ and\r\n_w_ had together the value of _q_. He compared them to the sound of _q_\r\nwhich is produced in Zend by the two letters _sv_ or _hv_, the latter\r\nbeing modified into _uv_ in the Old Persian.[464] Equally disastrous was\r\nhis introduction of the two diphthongs _hi_ for _ê_, and _au_ for _ô_.\r\nHe observed that these two letters are occasionally found together, and\r\nhe concluded they must correspond to the Sanscrit diphthong _ai_ = _ê_\r\nand _au_ = _ô_. The occurrence of an _h_ for an _a_ in one of them was a\r\nmatter of small difficulty. Indeed he had actually found the _ai_ = _ê_\r\nin Aidus = India; and suggests that _hi_ may be the form it assumes as\r\na medial.[465] The most eccentric peculiarities of his transliteration\r\nmay be traced to these unfortunate errors. His transformation of _a_\r\ninto _ng_ appears in his ‘Aurᵃngha Mᵃzdanga’ for ‘Aurahya Mazdaha.’\r\nThe diphthong _uv_ with the sound of _q_ seemed at first to yield a\r\nbetter result. By it he was able to read ‘Quarᵃzmiᵃh’ and ‘Arᵃqᵃtis,’\r\nwhich are more suggestive of the true words Chorasmia and Arachosia\r\nthan the correct forms ‘_Uv_arazamiya’ and ‘Hara_uv_atish.’[466] But,\r\non the other hand, it led him to read ‘qan’ or ‘qwan’ (Chaonia) for\r\n‘Uvaja’ (Susa), ‘Aqᵃ’ for ‘Ha_uv_,’ Patᵃqᵃ for ‘patuv,’ ‘Dᵃqistᵃn’ for\r\n‘duvaishtam,’ and so forth. The diphthong _hi_ (really _yi_) for the\r\nlong _ê_ produced ‘tesam’ in the place of ‘tyᵃisham.’ The diphthong _au_\r\n(really _ku_) for the long _ô_ was still more disastrous. Burnouf, when\r\nhe wrote ‘aqunuch,’ had nearly reached the correct transliteration of\r\n‘a_ku_naush,’ but it becomes scarcely recognisable in the ‘a_ô_nus’ of\r\nLassen. The first sign of this diphthong had been long since correctly\r\ndetermined by Grotefend as a _k_. But its identification depended in\r\ngreat measure on the belief that Murgab, where it is the first letter in\r\nthe inscription, represents the ancient Pasargadae, the city of Cyrus.\r\nLassen would by no means accept this as sufficient proof, for even upon\r\nthat hypothesis the inscription might not necessarily belong to Cyrus.\r\nSt. Martin read it ‘Houschousch,’ and conjectured that this name referred\r\nto ‘Ochus.’ Lassen accepted this view, and saw in the first two signs,\r\nwhich he took for _au_, the strongest confirmation that they had the\r\nvalue of the _ô_ long in Ochus. In 1845, when the result of his farther\r\nstudies were published, we find that his original alphabet has undergone\r\nconsiderable improvement. He has suppressed the second signs for each\r\nof the vowels _a_, _i_ and _u_, and the two diphthongs for the long _ê_\r\nand _ô_, that caused so much trouble, have disappeared. We hear no more\r\nof the double letters for _q_, nor of the second value _ng_ which he\r\nascribed to his initial _a_, now found to be more correctly _h_. He has\r\nalso struck out the two defective signs he admitted for _t_ and _û_. For\r\nthe rest, the improvement consists chiefly in sweeping away the errors\r\ninto which his love of Zend analogies had at first hurried him. The only\r\naddition he made to the number of his correct values was _thr_, suggested\r\nby Grotefend, to which, as we have said, he had previously nearly\r\napproached. The remaining signs now correctly represented are due to M.\r\nBeer and M. Jacquet, who wrote in the interval that separated the two\r\nMemoirs by Lassen.\r\n\r\nLassen’s translations are naturally much affected by the nine incorrect\r\nvalues he still retained, and by the errors he introduced himself. Yet\r\nif we compare the transliteration and translation of the Le Bruyn No.\r\n131, as given by Burnouf and Lassen, we cannot fail to recognise the\r\nsuperiority of the latter. For the ‘Bu izrk’ of the one we have ‘Baga\r\nwazark’ of the other, which closely anticipates the ‘Baga vazraka’ of\r\nthe correct version. The ‘Omam buiom,’ the ‘Homa excellent,’ is replaced\r\nby ‘imam buvam,’ ‘this earth;’ and many similar improvements may be\r\nnoted throughout. Both writers succeeded fairly well in rendering the\r\nsimple phrases, but great diversity still existed as to the meaning of\r\nthe obscurer passages. Both alike declare that Auramazda is the creator\r\nof heaven and of man; and that he has established Darius or Xerxes as\r\nKing. But when we proceed to the second paragraph of the inscription our\r\ntranslators go far astray. The passage beginning ‘king of countries’ is\r\nthus variously rendered:[467]\r\n\r\n           B. oahunâm pl. ôznânam.\r\n           L. dᵃnghunâm ps‘uwᵃznânâm.\r\n           S. dahyunâm . par’uv . zanânâm.\r\n\r\n  _Trans._ B. [roi] des provinces qui produisent les braves.\r\n           L. [rex] populorum bene parentium.\r\n           S. [König] der Länder die aus vielen Stämmen bestehen [or\r\n               more simply by Menant: des pays bien peuplés].\r\n\r\n           B. âahâhâ buîôhâ izrkâhâ rurôh âpôh.\r\n           L. aᵃnghâhâ bu‘mihâ wᵃzᵃrkâhâ d’uriᵃh âpyᵃh.\r\n           S. ahyâyâ . bu‘miyâ . vazrakâyâ . d’uraiy . apiy.\r\n\r\n  _Trans._ B. [roi] du monde excellent, divin, redoutable, protecteur.\r\n           L. [rex] existentis orbis terrarum magni, sustentator, auctor.\r\n           S. [König] dieser grossen Erde auch fernhin [or, with Menant:\r\n              ‘de cette vaste terre (qui commande) au loin et auprès’].\r\n\r\nLassen finishes thus: ‘Xerxes, rex magnus: ex voluntate Auramazdis\r\n(palatium) domitor Darius rex constituit. Is meus pater. Memet tuere,\r\nAuramazdes, heic felicitate: tum hoc ibi palatium, tum hoc patris Darii\r\nregis palatium, excelse Auramazdes, tuere heic felicitate’—a passage\r\nrendered by Menant: ‘Xerxès, le grand roi, déclare: Par la volonté\r\nd’Ormuzd, Darius mon père a construit cette demeure. Qu’Ormuzd me protège\r\navec les autres Dieux, qu’Ormuzd avec les autres Dieux protègent mon\r\nœuvre et l’œuvre de mon père le roi Darius.’ The I inscription, from\r\nwhich Lassen derived so much assistance, fared badly at his hands when he\r\nattempted to translate its concluding lines. Even in the list of proper\r\nnames he committed what must now appear to be the stupendous blunder of\r\nmistaking three common words for the names of three provinces of the\r\nEmpire. The words so honoured are: ‘ushkahyâ,’ ‘darayahyâ,’ ‘parauvaiy,’\r\nwhich figure as ‘Uscangha’ (the Uxii), ‘Drangha’ (the Drangii) and\r\n‘Parutah’ (the Aparyten).[468]\r\n\r\nHis transliteration of the others is naturally frequently defective, but\r\nnevertheless he identified twenty correctly. The four he failed in are\r\nSusa, Arabia, Egypt and Ionia. It would have been difficult for him to\r\nrecognise either Susa or Egypt, even if his transliteration had been more\r\nperfect. The first is represented in the cuneiform by three signs—_u_\r\n_v_ _j_—and reads ‘uvaja,’ which certainly does not suggest Susa. But\r\nLassen turned the _uv_ into _q_; as the last letter in his opinion was\r\n_n_ (𐎩, 28) he evolved _q’n_, from whence Chaona. The word for Egypt, as\r\ncorrectly transliterated ‘M’udray,’ would perhaps have been even more\r\nembarrassing than his own ‘Gudraha,’ in which he agreed with Burnouf\r\nin recognising ‘Gordyene.’ The word he read ‘Arbela’ was correctly\r\ntranslated ‘Arabia’ by Burnouf; and a somewhat too pedantic learning\r\nreconciled him to ‘Huns,’ which Burnouf had rightly rejected.[469]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nBEER AND JACQUET TO RAWLINSON—A.D. 1838-1846\r\n\r\n\r\nThe simultaneous publication of the two essays by Burnouf and Lassen\r\nroused considerable interest among those devoted to the obscure problems\r\nof cuneiform decipherment. Grotefend, whose attention for the previous\r\ntwenty years had been chiefly diverted to other pursuits, returned once\r\nmore to the subject in which he had previously achieved such great\r\nsuccess, and in the year following he published ‘Neue Beiträge zur\r\nErläuterung der Persepolitanischen Keilschrift.’ We have already seen\r\nthat his mind had by that time lost much of its elasticity, and he\r\ndisplayed more tenacity in defending his old errors than aptitude in\r\nrecognising the truth of the new discoveries. To some of these, however,\r\nhe is forced to give a qualified assent.[470] He may indeed claim the\r\nmerit of having now for the first time fixed the true value of one more\r\ncharacter. It may be recollected that the two signs 38 (𐏁) and 40 (𐎽)\r\nhad been long considered to express the same sound. Grotefend first\r\nattributed to both the value of _sch_; but in consequence of the Murgab\r\ninscription he afterwards considered that the last (40) must denote _sr_.\r\nThis opinion was not, however, generally accepted. St. Martin preferred\r\n_ch_ for both, and Lassen _s_. Burnouf, however, suggested _ch_ for the\r\nfirst and _l_ for the other. But Grotefend was now disposed to drop the\r\n_s_ from the last letter (𐎽) and to read _r_, or some slight modification\r\nof that sound, corresponding to the pronunciation adopted on the other\r\nside of the Tigris for the letter which is rendered an _l_ on this side.\r\nAccordingly in his translation of the Murgab inscription he writes simply\r\n_Kurusch_ and elsewhere _Kurhush_. In his revised alphabet it appears\r\nas _rh_.[471] Grotefend has also the merit in this tract of being the\r\nfirst to indicate that (𐏂), the _t_ of Lassen, might sometimes have the\r\nsound of _thr_, as in ‘puthra,’ and possibly in ‘Artakhshathra.’ In\r\nhis alphabet, however, he drops the sound of _r_ and makes the value\r\n_th_.[472]\r\n\r\nIn the following year a more important contribution was made by the\r\nappearance of two essays, one by E. F. F. Beer in Germany, the other by\r\nEugène Jacquet in France. The former was published in the ‘Hallische\r\nAllgemeine Zeitung,’ the other in four papers inserted in the ‘Journal\r\nAsiatique’ (1838).[473] Beer was a native of Bötzen, where he was born\r\nin 1805 and received his early education. He went to Leipzig in 1824\r\nand thenceforth he chiefly devoted himself to the study of Semitic\r\nPalaeography. He died in 1841, at the age of thirty-six. Both he and\r\nJacquet showed that Lassen was entirely mistaken in supposing that\r\nthere were different cuneiform signs to indicate the long and short\r\nsigns of the vowels _a_, _i_, _u_.[474] They simultaneously discovered\r\nthe correct values of the two letters 27 (𐎹) and 41 (𐏃). The first, the\r\n_h_ of Grotefend and Lassen, is ascertained to be _y_; the other, the\r\n_a_ of Grotefend and the ‘_a_ long’ and _ng_ of Lassen, was found to\r\nbe the aspirate _h_.[475] The remaining corrections are due to the\r\ningenuity of Jacquet alone. Jacquet was born at Brussels, but the whole\r\nof his short life was spent at Paris, where he died in 1838 at the age\r\nof only twenty-seven. His extraordinary precocity and the wonderful\r\nrange of his acquirements place him among the most remarkable men of his\r\ngeneration. He was distinguished at school by the critical accuracy of\r\nhis classical knowledge, and by the zeal with which he applied himself to\r\nthe geography, history and literature of ancient times. He had scarcely\r\nceased to be a school-boy when we find him studying Oriental languages\r\nunder the most distinguished masters. He was the pupil of De Chézy\r\nin Sanscrit, of Silvestre de Sacy in Arabic and Persian, of Jaubert\r\nin Turkish, and Abel Rémusat in Chinese.[476] His studies travelled\r\nfar beyond the ordinary course of even these learned professors, and\r\nembraced the various languages of India, the Malay Archipelago, Java, and\r\neven Ethiopia. At the same time he became familiar with most European\r\nlanguages, including Danish and Portuguese. At the age of eighteen,\r\nhe began to contribute regularly to the ‘Journal Asiatique.’ It was\r\nin its pages that he published his ‘Considerations on the Alphabets\r\nof the Philippines,’ which appeared in 1831, when he had just reached\r\nthe age of twenty. It at once attracted the attention of M. G. von\r\nHumboldt, who wrote to compliment the young author, and who farther\r\nshowed his appreciation by adopting in his own work most of Jacquet’s\r\nconjectures.[477] This was followed by Memoirs on the languages and\r\nliterature of Polynesia, including the cabalistic writings of Madagascar.\r\nFrom these subjects Jacquet passed to those affecting India. At the age\r\nof twenty-four we find him in correspondence with Mr. James Prinsep,\r\nthe Secretary of the Asiatic Society of Calcutta, and well known as the\r\nfirst decipherer of the Pali alphabet.[478] He has already planned the\r\nexecution of a ‘Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum,’ and is busily occupied\r\ncollecting materials from every available source. He is associated with\r\nRaoul Rochette in the study of Bactrian and Indo-Scythian medals, and\r\nhis extraordinary capacity as a numismatist is fully recognised. In the\r\nmidst of these various occupations he found time to devote himself to\r\ncuneiform inscriptions, which his knowledge of Zend and Pehlevi qualified\r\nhim to investigate. From 1835 he was in constant correspondence with\r\nLassen upon this and kindred subjects; and his singular ability enabled\r\nhim to overcome many difficulties that had baffled previous inquirers.\r\nHe not only earned distinction in the somewhat arid fields of philology\r\nand ethnology, but he was equally alive to the historical and literary\r\naspects of the subjects he investigated. He was particularly interested\r\nin tracing the intellectual relations of the people of China, India, and\r\nUpper Asia, and he devoted some interesting papers to the connection\r\nbetween the East and West in ancient and mediaeval times. These were\r\nmostly written at the age of nineteen to twenty. At nineteen we also find\r\nhim translating from the Danish and reviewing a tract by Rask on a Pali\r\nand Cingalese manuscript. He amused his leisure moments by translating\r\nfrom Chinese and from Sanscrit, in following the march of Alexander\r\nthrough Bactria, and in studying the history and literature of Buddhism.\r\nJacquet’s life was inspired by two passions, devoted attachment to his\r\nwidowed mother and a boundless love of knowledge. To the one he was ready\r\nto forego his hopes of fame: to the other he sacrificed his health.\r\nThere can be no doubt that his incessant and feverish labours induced\r\nthe fatal disease that first showed itself in the autumn of 1835, when\r\nhe was but twenty-four. The last three years of his life were ennobled\r\nby an heroic struggle against increasing weakness. In the face of much\r\nsuffering, he continued his labours to the end; and he died as a scholar\r\nmight wish to die, seated at his desk, pen in hand, alone among his books\r\nand manuscripts, his mind filled to the last moment of consciousness\r\nwith the work that had occupied his life. Thus passed away one of the\r\nmost promising scholars of the age. It is possible that the multitude\r\nof his acquirements was incompatible with profound knowledge in each\r\nof the many subjects he treated. M. Julien contested the accuracy of\r\nhis Chinese translations; and De Sacy seemed to doubt some other of his\r\nqualifications; but he received the enthusiastic applause of many other\r\nscholars—of the two Humboldts, of Ritter, Lassen, Burnouf, and Prinsep,\r\neach in their several departments.[479]\r\n\r\nHis essay on Cuneiform Decipherment was among the works he left\r\nincomplete. It was in the form of a review of Lassen’s recent Memoir, and\r\nthree papers on the subject appeared during his lifetime in the ‘Journal\r\nAsiatique,’ and a fourth was published shortly after his death.[480] It\r\ncan scarcely be said that he has gone beyond the introduction. The first\r\nessays are occupied chiefly with an account of what had been already\r\naccomplished in the field of cuneiform research, and with a review of\r\nthe ethnological points raised by Lassen’s treatment of the provinces\r\nof Darius. It is only incidentally that he touches upon the language\r\nof the inscriptions, and he reserves the discussion of the alphabet to\r\na future paper. Unfortunately, his premature death prevented him from\r\naccomplishing his task, and strange to say not a single note could be\r\nfound among his papers that might be used for the purpose. This is the\r\nmore remarkable from the frequent references he makes to that portion\r\nof his work in which he proposes to explain the points of difference\r\nwith Lassen, and to the various passages from the inscriptions that he\r\nintended to bring forward in support of his views.[481] On other subjects\r\nhe was in the habit of making the most elaborate notes, and it is\r\nscarcely possible to suppose that in a matter of this kind he charged his\r\nmemory with an accumulation of detached words and phrases collected from\r\nthe numerous inscriptions then available.\r\n\r\nThe essays indicate some of the corrections he proposed, but for the\r\nreason mentioned we are left very much to conjecture the foundation upon\r\nwhich they were based.\r\n\r\nWe see, however, that his correction of 27 (𐎹) from _h_ into _y_\r\nwas suggested by the words read by Lassen ‘Arbah’ and ‘Huna,’ which\r\nhe recognised should be more properly read ‘Araba_y_a’ and ‘_Y_una’\r\n(Ionians).[482] Similar etymological considerations led him to the\r\ncorrection of the 𐏃 _a_ into _h_. This letter occurs at the beginning of\r\nthe words Lassen reads ‘aryᵃwᵃ,’ ‘arᵃqᵃtis,’ and ‘Aidhus,’ where Jacquet\r\npoints out that the corresponding Zend forms require an aspirate.[483]\r\nIn these essays we have only found two other corrections suggested. The\r\nfirst is 10 (𐎺), the _e_ of Grotefend, which Lassen nearly approached in\r\n_w_, but to which Jacquet rightly gives the value of _v_.[484] The other\r\nis 26 (𐎰), the _i_ of Grotefend and _z_ of Lassen, which Jacquet changes\r\ninto _th_ in consideration of its occurrence in Assyria (Athuria) and\r\nSattagydes—which he reads ‘Thrataghadus’ and also (as Lassen adds) in\r\nMithra.[485]\r\n\r\nIf Jacquet’s contributions to the study of cuneiform had been limited\r\nto the essays in the ‘Journal Asiatique,’ they would have been\r\ncomparatively unimportant. But he was also in correspondence with Lassen\r\non the subject, and he not only communicated to him the result of his\r\ninvestigations, but also the reasons upon which they were based.[486] In\r\n1837, Lassen took part in the foundation of a journal devoted to Oriental\r\nsubjects—the ‘Zeitschrift für die Kunde des Morgenlandes.’[487] Grotefend\r\nbecame a contributor from the commencement,[488] and Lassen reported the\r\nprogress of cuneiform research as occasion required. His first essay\r\non the subject appeared in 1839,[489] and contained a criticism of the\r\nrecent writings of Beer and Jacquet; with, as regards the latter writer,\r\nsome important information derived from his correspondence. From this\r\nsource we learn that Jacquet recognised the correctness of the value of\r\n_r_, already assigned to 𐎽 by Grotefend; and completed it by determining\r\nit to be the _r_ before _u_.[490] He was led to this conclusion not only\r\nby the occurrence of the letter in ‘Kurus,’ but also in ‘paru,’ which\r\ncompares with the Zend for ‘many’—‘the king of many lands.’ He showed\r\nalso that 16 (𐎨), the _o_ of Grotefend and _i_ of Lassen, is really\r\n_ch_;[491] and finally 28 (𐎩), the _ng_ of Grotefend and _n_ of Lassen,\r\nhe finds to be _z_: which, if not correct, is a considerable improvement.\r\nHe was led to this conclusion by an ingenious conjecture. The letter\r\nis found in the province Lassen transliterated _u_ _w_ _n_, and which,\r\nfrom his theory of the diphthong, he read _q’n_ and supposed to denote\r\nChaona. The word occurs first in the list, and Jacquet inferred that it\r\nmust refer to the capital province, Susa. He did not altogether reject\r\nLassen’s _q_, but by changing the _n_ into _z_, he got near to what he\r\nsought, either in ‘uwᵃzᵃ’ or ‘qᵃzᵃ’ for Susa.[492] To sum up: Beer and\r\nJacquet both independently found the correct values for 27 (𐎹) _y_ and 41\r\n(𐏃) _h_; Jacquet added the correct value of 10 (𐎺) _v_, of 16 (𐎨) _ch_ or\r\n_c_ of 26 (𐎰) _th_; and he completed the value of 40 (𐎽) _r_ before _u_.\r\n\r\nBeer may thus be credited with having contributed two letters (27 and\r\n41), Jacquet with six (10, 16, 26, 27, 40 and 41). He also suggested that\r\nthe name of the first province in the I inscription referred to Susa and\r\nnot to Chaonia, and that Babirus—not Babisus—was the correct reading for\r\nBabylon.[493]\r\n\r\nThe year 1838 was memorable not only for the essays of Beer and Jacquet,\r\nbut also for the appearance of Major Rawlinson among the number of\r\ncuneiform scholars. We have already related how his attention was\r\ndirected to the subject while he was stationed at Kermanshah during\r\nthe years 1835-7, and that he succeeded in making a transcript of two\r\nhundred lines, or about one half of the great inscription at Behistun.\r\nWhen he first began the study, in 1835, he was aware that Grotefend had\r\npreviously ‘deciphered some names of the early sovereigns of the house\r\nof Achaemenes,’ but he could not obtain a copy of the alphabet, nor\r\nascertain from which inscription it had been formed. Rawlinson began upon\r\nthe two inscriptions he had copied at Elvend, and ‘when he proceeded to\r\ncompare them, he found that the characters coincided throughout, except\r\nin certain particular groups, and it was only reasonable to suppose that\r\nthe groups which were thus brought out and individualised must represent\r\nproper names. There were but three of these distinct groups in the two\r\ninscriptions,’ and they were arranged so as ‘to indicate a genealogical\r\nsuccession,’ no doubt ‘belonging to three consecutive generations of\r\nthe Persian monarchy; and it so happened that the first three names, of\r\nHystaspes, Darius and Xerxes, which I applied at hazard to the three\r\ngroups proved to answer and were in fact the true identifications.’[494]\r\nThis ingenious process was precisely the same as that already followed by\r\nGrotefend, which we have described in detail. Rawlinson appears, however,\r\nto have divined the method independently, though the application of the\r\nthree names to the three groups was no doubt suggested to him by what he\r\nhad heard reported by Grotefend’s discovery. He next turned his attention\r\nto the first two paragraphs of the Behistun inscription, and by the same\r\nmeans he detected five other proper names, which he identified with\r\nArsames, Ariaramnes, Teispes, Achaemenes and Persia. The recognition of\r\nthese eight proper names yielded him the values of eighteen cuneiform\r\ncharacters, which later study showed he had correctly identified.[495]\r\n\r\nSuch was the progress he had made down to the autumn of 1836 by his own\r\nindependent research. Shortly afterwards he received copies of Heeren\r\nand Klaproth’s writings, where at length he found the alphabets of\r\nGrotefend and St. Martin explained; but he writes: ‘Far from deriving\r\nany assistance from either of these sources, I could not doubt that my\r\nknowledge of the character ... was much in advance of their respective\r\nand in some measure conflicting systems of interpretation.’[496] He had\r\nindeed some cause for congratulation, for he had discovered eighteen\r\ncorrect values, while Grotefend was only successful in twelve, though,\r\nwith the two from Münter, he had at his disposal fourteen in all. St.\r\nMartin only made out two letters by his own ingenuity, and disposed\r\naltogether of not more than ten.[497]\r\n\r\nHaving thus greater means at his disposal, Rawlinson succeeded, in the\r\ncourse of 1837, in arriving at an approximate translation of the first\r\ntwo paragraphs of the Behistun inscription, ‘which,’ he says, ‘would\r\nhave been wholly inexplicable according to the systems of interpretation\r\nadopted either by Grotefend or Saint Martin,’ the only ones with which\r\nhe was at that time acquainted. By the end of the year his paper was\r\ncomplete, and on January 1, 1838, he forwarded the translation of the two\r\nparagraphs to the Royal Asiatic Society, where it was received on March\r\n14. In April a copy was submitted to the Asiatic Society in Paris, where\r\nit excited great interest, and Rawlinson was at once elected an Honorary\r\nMember. Steps were at the same time taken to put him in possession of\r\nthe latest results of European investigation. M. Burnouf sent him his\r\n‘Mémoire’ of 1836. M. Mohl shortly afterwards forwarded him a copy of\r\nthe Yaçna. Sir Gore Ouseley, the Vice-President of the Asiatic Society,\r\nintroduced him to the notice of Lassen, who wrote to him from Bonn in\r\nAugust (1838) to acquaint him with his alphabet and with the corrections\r\nmade since its appearance in 1836 ‘as well by others as by myself.’[498]\r\nWith the valuable assistance thus placed at his disposal, Rawlinson\r\ncontinued to work at his translations during the remainder of 1838 and\r\ntill the autumn of 1839. So early as January 1839, we learn from Mrs.\r\nRich that he had already succeeded in deciphering a large part of the two\r\nhundred lines.[499] He derived the greatest assistance from Burnouf’s\r\n‘Commentaire sur le Yaçna.’ ‘To this work,’ he says, ‘I owe in great\r\nmeasure the success of my translations.’ During his stay at Bagdad in\r\n1839 he was in correspondence with Lassen and Burnouf, who informed him\r\nof the progress recently made by Beer and Jacquet. Rawlinson, on his\r\npart, was rapidly completing his alphabet, and he lost no time in making\r\nhis friends acquainted with the result. He was surprised to find that\r\nthe European scholars just about kept pace with his own progress, and\r\nthat he had little to learn from them, though perhaps he might be in a\r\nposition to add something to their knowledge. He observed that Lassen’s\r\nnewest version of the alphabet ‘coincided in all essential points with\r\nmy own,’ but that his labours ‘have been of no farther assistance to me\r\nthan in adding one new letter to my alphabet and in confirming opinions\r\nwhich were sometimes conjectural.’[500] Rawlinson had indeed succeeded in\r\nworking out the whole of the alphabet by his own unaided ingenuity, so\r\nthat he was accustomed to say that there were only two letters he owed to\r\nothers: _k_, 𐎣 No. 4, which he learned from Burnouf, and _y_, 𐎹 No. 27,\r\nfrom Lassen, who got it from Jacquet.[501]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, his contributions to the general advance of the\r\nstudy were necessarily limited. By the time he became known to European\r\nscholars they had on their part advanced so far that only four letters of\r\nNiebuhr’s list remained for which a correct or approximate value had not\r\nbeen found. These were:\r\n\r\n  19 𐎮 _k_ of Lassen,\r\n  28 𐎩 _z_ of Jacquet,\r\n  32 𐎪 _g’_ of Lassen,\r\n  33 𐎸 _g_ of Lassen.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of Rawlinson did not, therefore, take place till after\r\nthe difficulty of the decipherment had been almost completely surmounted\r\nwithout his assistance. When his correspondence with Burnouf and Lassen\r\nbegan, in the autumn of 1838, he was, however, still in time to rectify\r\ntwo out of the four incorrect values.\r\n\r\nHe found 32 (𐎪) in the name of Cambyses, where it occurs as the fourth\r\nsign, which he transliterated correctly as _j_; Kₐbujᵢy. Hincks\r\nafterwards read the sign _zh(i)_ and Oppert _z(j)i_; but both these\r\nsounds have since yielded to the one proposed by Rawlinson, and it now\r\nappears as _j_ before _i_. But Rawlinson’s most striking success was\r\nwith the last letter, 33 (𐎸), another _g_ of Lassen. In his letter to\r\nBurnouf, he proposed to substitute _m_.[502] It is the initial letter\r\nin the name Lassen read ‘Gudrâha’ and thought indicated the Gordyaei.\r\nRawlinson suggested the name was M’udraya, and should be compared with\r\nthe Phoenician ‘Mŭdra’ and the Hebrew ‘Mitsraim,’ and signified, in fact,\r\nEgypt. Both of these emendations were, however, rejected by Lassen.[503]\r\n\r\nThere is another sign which came under discussion at this time. It will\r\nbe recollected that we have assigned 13 (𐎡) to Lassen, who gave it the\r\napproximate value of _t_. Rawlinson, however, suggested to Burnouf\r\nthat its true value is not _t_ but _tr_. In this, however, he had been\r\nanticipated, as we have seen, by Grotefend in 1837, who suggested\r\n_thr_.[504] It is admitted that it is impossible to distinguish between\r\nthe comparative merits of _tr_ and _thr_;[505] and as Rawlinson probably\r\nknew nothing of Grotefend’s ‘Beiträge’ at the time, he may be credited\r\nwith having discerned the correct sound of the sign.[506]\r\n\r\nThen, as on subsequent occasions, his great merit lay in the superiority\r\nof his translations. He was already in a position to criticise Lassen’s\r\nefforts in this department with some severity. He thought that Lassen\r\nhad ‘in many cases misunderstood both the etymology of the words and\r\nthe grammatical structure of the language.’[507] When Rawlinson\r\nfound that he was obliged to renounce the claim to a ‘priority of\r\nalphabetical discovery,’ and that he was continually being anticipated\r\nin the values he gave to the signs which he had himself just ‘obtained\r\nthrough continued labour,’ he was consoled by the reflection that he\r\nwas ‘the first to present to the world a literal and, as I believe, a\r\ncorrect grammatical translation of nearly two hundred lines of cuneiform\r\nwriting.’ Unfortunately, however, he withheld his translation, in the\r\nhope of making the accessories more perfect. A host of historical and\r\ngeographical questions started up in rapid succession, and he was\r\nunwilling to limit his task to the series of critical notes which was\r\nall he at first contemplated. He accordingly began to recast his Memoir\r\nin the autumn of 1839, with the confident hope that it would be ready\r\nfor publication early in the spring of 1840; but the outbreak of the\r\nAfghan War interrupted his literary projects and summoned him to a very\r\ndifferent sphere of activity. Before he left, however, he had time to\r\nmake a second communication to the Asiatic Society, in which he related\r\nsome of the results of his study. His paper, which was read before a\r\nmeeting of the Society, contained a ‘_précis_ of the contents of a\r\nlarge part of the Behistun inscription, which differed in no material\r\nrespect’ from the translation he elaborated at a much later date.[508]\r\nIndeed, we are told that, so far as the original materials extended, it\r\nwas ‘absolutely identical’ with his subsequent work, which, as we shall\r\npresently see, was so perfect that later scholarship has found little to\r\ncorrect.[509] This was certainly a great achievement on the part of a\r\nyoung officer of twenty-nine years of age, and it was far in advance of\r\nanything that had yet been accomplished.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the number of inscriptions available for study continued to\r\nincrease. In 1837, Grotefend published four lines of an inscription from\r\nthe collection of Lord Aberdeen and Sir Gore Ouseley, which had recently\r\nbeen presented to the British Museum by Mountstuart Elphinstone. With the\r\nassistance of Lassen’s alphabet he deciphered the name of the king to\r\nwhom it belonged. It read ‘Artks’t’â,’ which he easily identified with\r\nArtaxerxes.[510] The last line contained what appeared to be a new letter\r\n(𐏍), which he thought had the value of _v_.\r\n\r\nTwo years later (1839) the inscriptions copied by Mr. Rich so far back\r\nas 1821 at last saw the light.[511] Several of them were already known\r\nby the copies made by Le Bruyn and Niebuhr; but the plates were found\r\nto contain the complete text of the Inscription of Artaxerxes, of which\r\nGrotefend’s formed the four concluding lines (Pl. 23, Inscr. P). It\r\nwas taken from the north wall of the palace, now identified as that of\r\nOchus, facing the Palace of Darius. He also was the first to copy the\r\nInscription of Xerxes from the anta of his palace (Pl. 16, Inscr. E).\r\nThe same inscriptions are frequently repeated, and it was an advantage\r\nto have copies of more than one version. Thus Rich gave the celebrated\r\nfour-line Inscription of Xerxes, copied from the east portal of the\r\npalace, which was already so well known from Niebuhr’s copy, taken from\r\nthe north (Inscr. G, Pl. 18). Rich has also given two versions of the\r\nInscription of Darius—one taken from the anta of the palace and already\r\nknown from Le Bruyn (131) (Inscr. Cᵃ), the other from the south stairs,\r\nwhich he was himself the first to disinter from the rubbish by which it\r\nwas hidden (Pl. 20, Cᵇ).[512]\r\n\r\nOf greater importance than any of these were the copies taken by the\r\nDanish Sanscrit scholar Westergaard. He was commissioned by the Danish\r\nGovernment to visit Persia for the purpose of collecting inscriptions\r\nand other matters of archæological interest. He went to Persepolis and\r\nNaksh-i-Rustam in 1843, and not only did he carefully recopy all the\r\ninscriptions already known, but some others that had hitherto been\r\nneglected. Among the latter are the inscriptions over the animals on the\r\ngreat Eastern Porch at Persepolis, and the long inscription upon the\r\ntomb at Naksh-i-Rustam. The first is indeed to be found in Mr. Rich’s\r\ncollection (Pl. 24, 25, 26); but the copy, as we have seen, was made\r\nby his Seyid and was found useless for purposes of study. All previous\r\ntravellers had recoiled before the difficulties of transcribing the tomb\r\ninscription, but these were at length surmounted by Westergaard, and his\r\ncopy is the greatest prize he secured. It was found to be an inscription\r\nof Darius, and it served to identify the rock-hewn sepulchre upon which\r\nit is inscribed with the tomb of that king. It contained a more complete\r\nenumeration of the provinces than the I inscription, and as it was\r\ntrilingual, it was hoped that so large a number of proper names would at\r\nlength afford a clue to the values of the signs in the second and third\r\ncolumns, which had as yet remained unknown. Westergaard was the first\r\nof the travellers who possessed a competent knowledge of the cuneiform\r\ncharacter, before he undertook the difficult task of transcribing them;\r\nand consequently his copies are of exceptional value and accuracy. On\r\nhis return to Bonn he gave Lassen his copies of the first or Persian\r\ncolumn; and reserved to himself the study of the second or Susian column.\r\nIn the following year (1844) the two scholars published the results of\r\ntheir labours in the ‘Zeitschrift,’ and their Memoirs afterwards appeared\r\ntogether in a separate volume under the title ‘Ueber die Keilinschriften\r\nder Ersten und Zweiten Gattung, von Chr. Lassen und N. L. Westergaard’\r\n(Bonn, 1845).\r\n\r\nSix years had now elapsed since Lassen published his first Memoir. During\r\nthe interval Beer and Jacquet had made their contributions to the general\r\nknowledge; and although Major Rawlinson had not yet published his Memoir\r\non the Behistun inscription, he had been in correspondence with Lassen\r\nsince 1838, and had already corrected two letters. It is interesting\r\ntherefore to inquire how far Lassen profited by these investigations. We\r\nhave seen that he had nine incorrect values in 1836 for the letters in\r\nNiebuhr’s list.[513] These were:\r\n\r\n  16 𐎨 _i_\r\n  19 𐎮 _k_\r\n  25 𐎤 with _u_ = _ô_\r\n  26 𐎰 (_z_)\r\n  27 𐎹 _h_\r\n  28 𐎩 _n_\r\n  32 𐎪 _g_\r\n  33 𐎸 _g_\r\n  40 𐎽 _s_\r\n\r\nBy 1844 he corrected the four following:\r\n\r\n(1) 25 𐎤 into _q_, an approximate value for _k_.\r\n\r\n(2) 26 𐎰 into _θ_, following Jacquet _th_.\r\n\r\n(3) 27 𐎹 into _j_ for _y_, following Beer and Jacquet.\r\n\r\n(4) 40 𐎽 into _r_, following Jacquet.[514]\r\n\r\nHe also accepted the corrected value of 41 (𐏃) as the aspirate _h_,\r\nfollowing Jacquet and Beer; but this value we have already allowed to\r\nGrotefend’s _a_ for _ha_, as approximately correct. One other letter, 22\r\n(𐎬) _t_, which he made correct in 1836, he now changes into _d’h_. Thus,\r\nin 1844, he still had six wrong values; of these one had been correctly\r\nfixed by himself in 1836, 22 (𐎬) _t_; another, 16 (𐎨) _ch_, recently by\r\nJacquet, and two by Rawlinson, 32 (𐎪) _j_, and 33 (𐎸) _m_ before _u_.\r\n\r\nThere thus remained only two letters not yet provided with correct\r\nvalues: viz. 19 (𐎮), which was fixed by Holtzmann in 1845 as _d_ before\r\n_i_,[515] and 28 (𐎩), fixed simultaneously by Hincks and Rawlinson in\r\n1846 as _j_ before _a_.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the thirty-three signs in Niebuhr’s alphabet that gained\r\nfinal recognition, two others have since been added. One of them was\r\nfirst found at Behistun by Rawlinson, 43 (𐎵) _n_, and does not appear\r\nin Lassen. The other, 44 (𐎦), was admitted in 1836 by both Burnouf\r\nand Lassen as _gh_ and _g_, and is finally accepted as _g_ before _u_\r\n(Spiegel). But in the Memoir of 1836, Lassen farther sanctioned two other\r\nsigns, ([Persian]) _t_, and ([Persian]) _u_, which he now rightly omits\r\nas defective signs for 24 (𐎫) _t_ and 36 (𐎢) _u_.\r\n\r\nHis new alphabet shows also a great improvement in other respects. In\r\ndeference to the decisive opinions of both Beer and Jacquet, Lassen\r\nhas given up his double signs for the long and short vowels. He indeed\r\nadmits that his _a_ (𐏃) is in fact _h_; his _î_ (𐎨) is _k_, and his\r\n_û_ ([Persian]) is defective.[516] His diphthongs (𐎹 · 𐎡) _ê_ and (𐎤\r\n· 𐎢) _ô_, likewise disappear; and, what is even of more consequence,\r\nhis disastrous (𐎢 · 𐎺) for _q_ is quietly suffered to drop. Strange to\r\nsay, the unlucky conjunction of these two letters _u_ and _w_ with _q_\r\nexcited the unbounded admiration of Jacquet, who regarded it as the most\r\nbrilliant inspiration of its author.[517]\r\n\r\nTo compensate for these omissions, Lassen added a sign ([Persian]) which\r\nwith 44 (𐎦), in addition to the thirty-three signs in Niebuhr’s list,\r\nmade up the thirty-five letters which constitute his alphabet.[518]\r\nThis sign ([Persian]) is always found in conjunction with 31 (𐎴) _n_.\r\nGrotefend pointed out long ago that the two signs 𐎴 · [Persian] replace\r\nthe word for ‘king’ and, whatever might be their pronunciation, there was\r\nno doubt as to their signification.[519] It was at first supposed that\r\nthe last letter was an alternative sign for 27 (𐎹); but this had to be\r\nabandoned, and Lassen now gives it the value of _rp_, and he reads the\r\ncombined letters ‘narap.’ He was led to this result because Westergaard\r\nthought that the word corresponding to it in the second column had the\r\nsound of ‘narap.’[520] The two signs are now treated as together forming\r\na monogram for ‘king,’ and in transliteration they are represented by\r\n_khs_ to indicate an abbreviated form of the royal title. He adds also\r\nthe two new signs that occur in the Inscription of Artaxerxes. The one\r\n(𐏍) first appeared in the copy published by Grotefend in 1837; the\r\nother (𐏏) is dimly discernible in Rich (Pl. 23, line 10), and is no\r\ndoubt more clearly delineated by Westergaard. The first had evidently\r\nthe sound of _dah_, for it precedes the _j_ in the well-known word\r\n‘dahjunam’; the other clearly denotes the complex sound ‘bumi’ in the\r\nword ‘bumi-ja.’[521]\r\n\r\nThe long line of scholars from Münter to Jacquet, whose labours we\r\nhave now passed in review, had at length succeeded in deciphering the\r\ncuneiform alphabet of the first species of writing found at Persepolis,\r\nand, with the exception of two, they had attached correct values to\r\neach of the thirty-five letters. When, therefore, Lassen wrote his\r\nsecond Memoir, the task he had to perform was concerned much less with\r\nthe alphabet than with the numerous strange words formed by it, which\r\nit was now necessary to assign a meaning to and connect together by\r\ngrammatical rules. It is clear there was only one method to pursue, and\r\nthat was to compare them with the words and forms of other languages\r\nwith which the Old Persian was likely to be connected. It was natural\r\nin the first instance to turn to Zend, the sacred language of the\r\ncountry in which the inscriptions were found; and the most superficial\r\ncomparison, which was all that was then possible, was sufficient to\r\nprove that the two languages were closely allied. The early scholars\r\nwere, however, greatly impeded by the extremely imperfect knowledge\r\nof Zend that as yet prevailed; and even if the cuneiform alphabet had\r\nbeen completely deciphered by Grotefend, it may be doubted whether the\r\nmeans were then available to grapple successfully with the difficulties\r\nof translation.[522] At that time Zend was known only by the work of\r\nDuperron, which, however remarkable for the time at which it appeared,\r\nwas quite inadequate for the purpose. Indeed some scholars, even long\r\nafterwards, had doubts as to the genuineness of the language itself.\r\nSince then, however, the edition of the Yaçna published by Burnouf\r\nin 1833 placed the study upon an entirely different footing; and the\r\nprogress made by Bopp and many others in Sanscrit was also of material\r\nservice. It thus happened that concurrently with the improvement of the\r\ncuneiform alphabet the chief obstacles to the translation of the language\r\nwere removed. When Burnouf and Lassen wrote their Memoirs in 1836, little\r\nprogress had been made in that direction beyond the identification of\r\nthe names of the Achaemenian kings, and of a few simple words. The\r\nattempt to go beyond rested chiefly upon conjecture and frequently\r\nresulted in absurdities of which the constellation of Moro is the typical\r\ninstance.[523]\r\n\r\nProgress was at first considerably retarded by a misapprehension of\r\nthe relation between the Old Persian of the inscriptions and the\r\nlanguage of the Zend-Avesta. Grotefend for a long time thought the two\r\nwere absolutely identical, an opinion which, however, he subsequently\r\nmodified.[524] Both Burnouf and Lassen, especially the latter, were at\r\nfirst inclined to suppose too close a resemblance between them. We have\r\nalready pointed out some of the errors that resulted, especially with\r\nregard to the long and short vowels and the diphthongs. But this error\r\nwas speedily corrected, and Lassen afterwards showed that the relation\r\nthey bore to each other was that of descent from a common parent; and\r\nalthough Old Persian is historically more modern, it continued to retain\r\nsome of the primitive forms which Zend had changed. While he recognised\r\nthat they were two distinct dialects, he admitted that they closely\r\nresembled each other, and hence the great assistance he derived from\r\nthe Zend in the interpretation of the inscriptions.[525] After Zend,\r\nhe found that Sanscrit afforded him the greatest help. Indeed he was\r\nsurprised to observe how often it agreed with the Old Persian, and it was\r\nparticularly useful with respect to the grammatical forms.[526]\r\n\r\nIt is the natural affectation of the minute scholar to exaggerate the\r\nimportance of an accurate knowledge of grammatical construction, and to\r\ndisparage or ridicule even great results that may have been attained in\r\ndefiance of strict rule. It became the fashion to underrate the very\r\nconsiderable achievements of Lassen as a translator, because it was\r\nafterwards found that he fell into several errors which later knowledge\r\nhas cleared away. Major Rawlinson was unfortunately peculiarly liable\r\nto depreciate the work of his competitors, and it is therefore with no\r\nsurprise that we find him dwell with more emphasis upon their failures\r\nthan upon their success. But it is certainly remarkable that Hincks,\r\nthe Irish cuneiform scholar, should have been betrayed into a judgment\r\nthat must now be regarded as singularly unfair and censorious. Writing\r\nin 1847, he gave expression to the opinion that ‘Lassen seems to have\r\nbeen completely destitute of the peculiar talent of a decipherer, and\r\nhis attempts at translation were consequently as bad as could be made\r\n... the number and grossness of many of his mistakes are such as to\r\ncreate astonishment.’[527] It is quite true that Lassen sometimes mistook\r\nverbs for adjectives, and that in some places he had to warn the reader\r\nthat his translation was purely conjectural. But his services should be\r\nestimated by the state of knowledge at the time he wrote. It must be\r\nremembered that when he began these studies, in 1836, all that was known\r\nwere a few proper names, and every attempt to pass beyond had hitherto\r\nled to ridiculous misrepresentations of the true meaning of the texts.\r\nWhen, in 1844, he completed his translation of the whole series of\r\ninscriptions of the Persian column—with the exception of the Behistun,\r\nwhich was not accessible to him—he had succeeded in making their contents\r\nas well known as they are at present in all the essential points of their\r\nsubject-matter. It must be recollected also that he had to contend with\r\ndifficulties that have since been in great measure removed. The texts\r\nupon which he worked were in many places in need of emendation; and the\r\nparallel columns in Susian and Babylonian, which have afforded so much\r\nassistance to later translators, were then completely unknown. Moreover,\r\nit should not be forgotten that, notwithstanding all the advantages that\r\nare now at command, many of the passages over which Lassen stumbled are\r\nstill the subject of dispute.\r\n\r\nHis collection included the ten independent inscriptions at Persepolis;\r\nthe Tomb inscription at Naksh-i-Rustam, so lately recovered by\r\nWestergaard; the Cyrus inscription from Murgab; the inscriptions of\r\nElvend and Van that only a few years before had acquired an entire\r\nvolume to expound. He added a translation of the short inscription on\r\nthe crystal cylinder brought from Egypt and now in the British Museum.\r\nHe reads: ‘Ego Darius hominum tutor.’ He also translated the Denon\r\ninscription, found in 1800 near Suez, which, according to him, signifies\r\n‘Darius hominum tutor magnus.’ Both these inscriptions write ‘King’\r\nwith the abbreviation to which Lassen assigned the value of ‘narpa’ and\r\ntranslates ‘hominum tutor.’ The true meaning of the first is ‘I [am]\r\nDarius the King,’ and of the second ‘Darius the great King.’[528] The\r\nsame abbreviation occurs in the inscription on the Caylus vase, but in\r\nthis case Lassen translates it simply as ‘rex’—‘Xerxes rex magnus.’[529]\r\n\r\nAlthough Lassen may justly claim great praise for the skill he has\r\ndisplayed in his translations, it must not be supposed that he succeeded\r\nin overcoming all the difficulties that stood in his way. His task was\r\ngreatly simplified by the constant recurrence of a set form of words\r\nwith which the inscriptions usually begin.[530] At Persepolis this form\r\nis first met with on the Porch, and it occurs altogether five times in\r\nthe ten Persepolitan inscriptions. The two Hamadan inscriptions consist\r\nof nothing else. A shorter form, which begins at the second paragraph\r\nof the one just mentioned, is repeated three times at Persepolis. The\r\nlonger form sometimes reaches over twenty lines, and as the whole series\r\nof these inscriptions only amount to three hundred lines, it is evident\r\nhow considerably the task of the translator was reduced. Most of the\r\ninscriptions are, as we have seen, repeated in several places: the window\r\ninscription in the Palace of Darius no less than eighteen times. But the\r\nvery limitation thus imposed upon him was one of the chief obstacles to\r\nhis progress. Indeed, until the Behistun inscription became available it\r\nwas impossible to acquire any extensive knowledge of the language. To\r\nthis circumstance must be partly ascribed the inferiority of Lassen’s\r\nrendering of difficult passages, when compared with the facility we\r\nobserve in Rawlinson from the first.\r\n\r\nBetween the publication of the First Memoir and the one we are now\r\nconsidering, Lassen made considerable progress. In the I inscription\r\nthe names of the twenty-five provinces are now given correctly with\r\nthe exception of two: ‘Gordyaei,’ which Rawlinson had shown should read\r\n‘M’udraya,’ Egypt; and ‘Parutia,’ which is not a proper name at all, but\r\nmeans ‘east.’ Neither Lassen nor Rawlinson had much success in their\r\ntreatment of the new names of provinces found at Naksh-i-Rustam, and no\r\ngeneral agreement has even yet been reached with regard to some of them.\r\nA careful collation of the difficult passages in the subject-matter of\r\nthe inscriptions is, however, sufficient to prove the great superiority\r\nof Rawlinson over Lassen, both in the actual work of translation and\r\nin the necessary emendation of a disputed text. An instance of the\r\ncomparative ingenuity of the two scholars is afforded by a passage in the\r\nNaksh-i-Rustam inscription, where the last letter of the thirteenth line\r\nis obliterated and the passage runs thus (Lassen’s transliteration):\r\n\r\n  line 13                        ?\r\n   ”   14 Arçahjâ puthra ârija ârija d—\r\n   ”   15 thra\r\n\r\nThe omission of the letter led Lassen into one of the greatest blunders\r\nin his revised translation. His ‘progenies Arçis’ commits him to a\r\ndefinite historical error, while the rendering of the following words\r\n‘ârija ârija’ is merely an instance of aberration to which the greatest\r\nscholars are occasionally subject. Rawlinson, who greatly excelled him in\r\n‘intuition,’ had no difficulty in supplying the missing letter as _p_,\r\nand he translated the passage correctly: ‘son of a Persian, an Arian, of\r\nArian descent,’ in the place of ‘Progenies Arçis, a venerabilibus stirpis\r\nauctoribus oriundi’! Lassen’s knowledge now enabled him to point out\r\nseveral instances in the Inscription of Artaxerxes Ochus that served\r\nto illustrate the decay of the language, though the interval from the\r\nclassical age of Darius was not more than a hundred and ninety years. It\r\nis here that the two new signs—or rather contractions—for the syllables\r\n‘dah’ and ‘bumi’ first occur. Of more interest is the evidence this\r\ninscription affords of the degeneration of the Persian religion by the\r\nadmittance of Mithra into its worship. Artaxerxes the Third traces his\r\ngenealogy through Artaxerxes the Second (Mnemon), Darius the Second\r\n(Nothus), Artaxerxes the First (Longimanus), Xerxes, Darius the First,\r\nand Hystaspes, to Arsames the Achaemenian; and neither of the two last\r\nare distinguished by the royal title.\r\n\r\nThe most important publication after Lassen’s essay in 1844 was a\r\ncriticism that appeared upon it by Adolf Holtzmann in the following\r\nyear.[531] It was written with much personal animosity to Lassen,\r\nand this enlivens in an amusing fashion the extreme aridity of the\r\nsubject-matter.\r\n\r\nOnly two letters now remained to be correctly determined: 19 (𐎮),\r\nthe _k’h_ of Lassen, and this Holtzmann successfully accomplished.\r\nThe letter occurs in the words Lassen transliterated ‘jak’hija’\r\nand ‘hak’hi(s).’[532] Holtzmann substituted _d_ and read the first\r\nword ‘jadij,’ which he compared with the Sanscrit ‘jadi,’ Zend\r\n‘jedhi’—‘when’—instead of Lassen’s ‘venerandus,’ a meaning that turned\r\nout to be correct.[533] Finally, he reviewed all the words in which the\r\nletter occurs, and he found that the substitution of _d_ for _k_ enabled\r\nhim to assign satisfactory meanings to the whole of them.[534]\r\n\r\nHoltzmann is also credited[535] with having slightly improved the value\r\nof 28 (𐎩), the _z_ of Jacquet, by giving it the sound of _g_—presumably\r\n_g_ soft, but as it always precedes _a_ the reader would naturally assume\r\nit to be hard, as in ‘gadija,’ ‘aga’mija,’ etc. It is in fact _j_ before\r\n_a_.\r\n\r\nHoltzmann has the merit also of rectifying several of Lassen’s verbal\r\nerrors. For example, he showed that ‘hadâ,’ which Lassen thought\r\nsignified ‘continually,’ in reality means ‘with.’[536] Of more importance\r\nwas his treatment of the word then read ‘Paru-ja’ (‘parauvaiy’).\r\nRawlinson had already annihilated two of Lassen’s provinces—Uscangha\r\n(the Uxii) and Drangha (the Drangii)[537]—and Holtzmann now disposes of\r\nthe third—Paru-ja—which Lassen still cherished in 1845. Lassen derived\r\nthe word from the Sanscrit ‘parvata,’ ‘hill,’ and thought it was a\r\nmountain district called Parutia, near the Persian frontier. Holtzmann\r\nhad recourse to the Sanscrit ‘purva’ (easterly), and translated the\r\nsentence ‘the land of the east,’ meaning the eastern provinces whose\r\nnames followed.[538] When Holtzmann attempted the correction of longer\r\nsentences he was not always so successful. For example, he rendered the\r\nwords that were then transliterated ‘jak’hija âwamâ (ma)nijâhja hak’â\r\nânijanâ mâ rçam imam Pârçam,’ ‘When one goes—from Anijana to the ocean,\r\nthis land they call Persia’!—the real meaning being ‘Wenn Du so denkst\r\nvor Niemanden möchte ich zittern—so schütze dieses Persische Heer.’[539]\r\nAnother instance of ingenuity is the rendering of the line ‘hak’â\r\nânijanâ nija tᵃrçᵃtija,’ ‘ab Anjana usque ad Tarsatia’ (_sic_). It will\r\nenable the reader to see how uncertain was the progress yet made when\r\nthese same words were rendered by Lassen, in 1844, ‘adoratio consecrata\r\ncontingit,’ and by Rawlinson, in 1846, ‘From the enemy feareth not’—which\r\nclosely approached the true translation: ‘fürchtet sich ... vor keinem\r\nAnderen.’[540]\r\n\r\nSometimes, however, Holtzmann showed a marked improvement upon\r\nLassen. Thus the latter scholar translated the fiftieth line of the\r\nNaksh-i-Rustam inscription ‘Auramuzdi adorationem attulere, quae\r\n[regiones] illae palatium exstruxere.’ Holtzmann substitutes ‘Auromazdas\r\nenim opem tulit dum opus feci,’ and Rawlinson, in 1846, correctly renders\r\nthe sentence ‘Aurmazd brought help to me so that I accomplished the\r\nwork.’[541]\r\n\r\nWhen Rawlinson was writing his Memoir in 1846 he remarked upon the\r\nsingular fact that no Englishman except himself had yet taken part in the\r\nwork of decipherment. Many had indeed occupied themselves in the more\r\nadventurous task of collecting the materials—among whom were Morier,\r\nOuseley, Ker Porter, and Rich—but so far Rawlinson was alone among his\r\ncountrymen as a decipherer. This special study arose first in northern\r\nEurope, and it is remarkable how large a share was borne by Denmark.\r\nNiebuhr, upon whose foundation all later scholars built, was born at\r\nLudwigsworth in North Hanover; but he served under the king of Denmark,\r\nand his Travels were first published at Copenhagen. Münter, though a\r\nGerman by descent and birth, was brought up at Copenhagen, and passed\r\nhis whole life in Denmark, where he died as Bishop of Seeland. Rask\r\nwas a Dane, and he laboured throughout his life as a Professor at the\r\nUniversity of Copenhagen. Westergaard belonged to the same nationality\r\nand, as in the case of Niebuhr, his journey to the East was due to the\r\nliberality of the Danish Government. Lassen was born and educated at\r\nBergen, though, it is true, he left Norway at the age of twenty-two and\r\npassed the greater portion of his life at Bonn. Tychsen was also of\r\nNorwegian descent, but born at Tondern, in Schleswig. Grotefend was a\r\nHanoverian, born at Münden. Beer, on the other hand, was an Austrian from\r\nBötzen. France was as yet represented only by two scholars, St. Martin\r\nand Burnouf; Belgium by one, Jacquet; and England also by one, Rawlinson.\r\nBut the latter was soon joined by two others, Hincks and Norris, both of\r\nwhom, especially the former, were soon to acquire a brilliant reputation\r\nin cuneiform studies. The Rev. Edward Hincks belonged to a Chester\r\nfamily settled in Ireland since 1767. His father was a Presbyterian\r\nminister who for a time kept a school at Cork, and afterwards became\r\nclassical master at the Belfast Academy (1821-36). He was a man of\r\nthe most varied learning, who lectured with equal success on two such\r\ndifferent subjects as Chemistry and Hebrew. He wrote a Greek Grammar,\r\nand was a frequent contributor to the proceedings of the Royal Irish\r\nAcademy. He married a Chester lady, by whom he had a numerous family,\r\nmany of whose members rose to distinction. One son became Archdeacon of\r\nConnor, another Professor of Natural Science at Toronto, a third was well\r\nknown in Canadian politics. He became Premier in 1851, and was called\r\nthe ‘Colbert of Canada.’ He was afterwards appointed to a Colonial\r\nGovernorship, and was made a K.C.B. in 1862. His brother Edward, the\r\ncuneiform scholar, was born in 1792, and after a distinguished career\r\nat the University of Dublin, he settled down in a remote country parish\r\nas Rector of Killyleagh in the county Down. In that inhospitable region\r\nhe spent forty-one years, till his death in 1866. He first attracted\r\nattention by his papers on Egyptian hieroglyphics, contributed to the\r\nIrish Academy. His contributions to cuneiform literature began in June\r\n1846, when he read a paper ‘On the First and Second Kinds of Persepolitan\r\nWriting.’[542] This was followed by another in November ‘On the Three\r\nKinds of Persepolitan Writing and on the Babylonian Lapidary Character.’\r\nIn January of the following year a farther essay appeared, ‘On the Third\r\nPersepolitan,’ and in the December after he published a long paper in the\r\n‘Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society’ on the Inscriptions of Van.[543]\r\n\r\nWhen he entered upon the study of the first column but little remained\r\nto be done to complete the decipherment of the Persian alphabet. His\r\nattention was therefore chiefly directed to the writing in the Susian\r\nand Babylonian columns. In a postscript to his first essay he insisted\r\non the substantial resemblance of the language of the third column to\r\nthose of the Babylonian and Assyrian inscriptions. He supported the\r\nopinion which had been even then suggested, that both of these ‘have\r\nmuch in common with the Semitic languages’ and he announced that he had\r\nread the names of Babylon and Nineveh on the bricks.[544] He devoted his\r\ningenuity in the first instance to prove the identity of the cursive mode\r\nof writing found in the third column and in some Babylonian inscriptions\r\nwith the character seen on Babylonian bricks and in the East India House\r\nInscription. He published two elaborate tables in illustration of this\r\ntheme, and offered a few suggestions as to the meaning of the signs.[545]\r\nHis later contributions deal chiefly with the Assyrian inscriptions,\r\nwhich, since the excavations made by Botta, began to attract the largest\r\nshare of public attention. In 1850, he wrote on Khorsabad, on the\r\nAssyrio-Babylonian phonetic system, and on Assyrian mythology. Among\r\nhis more important contributions to Assyriology are his treatise on the\r\nAssyrian Verb (1855-6) and his Assyrian Grammar, begun in 1866.[546] The\r\nlast was left unfinished, and, strange to say, no notes were found among\r\nhis papers to assist in its completion. Like Jacquet, he seems to have\r\ncharged his memory with the whole burden of the complicated task he had\r\nset himself to accomplish. Few scholars enjoyed a higher reputation for\r\nextraordinary acumen in unravelling the difficulties of this intricate\r\nsubject. The ‘intuition’ he displayed was specially remarkable, and often\r\nled him to anticipate conclusions that other scholars only reached by a\r\nslow and arduous course of inquiry. Even Rawlinson, who shared to a high\r\ndegree in this rare gift, often found himself anticipated by the Irish\r\nscholar. Hincks, for example, was the first to decipher the name and\r\ntitles of Nebuchadnezzar in the India House Inscription and in many other\r\nplaces, where Grotefend thought he had found ‘forms of prayer.’[547]\r\nThis was, however, after he had received the Behistun Inscription, where\r\n‘Nebuchadnezzar’ was found by Rawlinson in the Persian column.[548]\r\n\r\nHincks’s paper ‘On the First and Second Kinds of Persepolitan Writing’\r\nwas read to the Royal Irish Academy on June 9, 1846, and he communicated\r\nits contents to Mr. Norris, the secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society,\r\nwho sent a detailed account of it to Major Rawlinson at Bagdad. This\r\nletter was despatched from London on August 20, and five days afterwards,\r\non the twenty-fifth of the same month,[549] Major Rawlinson sent off\r\na Supplementary Note in which, by a very singular coincidence, he\r\nintroduced some important modifications in his system of transliteration\r\nthat brought it into substantial agreement with that just then proposed\r\nby Hincks. Thus the two documents crossed each other on the way,\r\na circumstance that affords conclusive proof of their independent\r\nproduction.[550] But as Hincks’s paper was read in June and Rawlinson’s\r\nnote not despatched till August, the priority must be awarded to the\r\nformer. This was the first occasion on which Hincks had contributed\r\nto cuneiform research, and, as we have said, he had the good fortune\r\nto forestall Rawlinson in one of his most useful discoveries. When he\r\nwrote, Lassen’s Second Memoir of 1844 was still the chief authority on\r\nthe subject, and it is to it that he directs his criticism. In looking\r\nover Lassen’s alphabet, nothing was more remarkable than the number of\r\nsigns allotted to certain supposed modifications of the same sound. Thus\r\n_k_, for example, was represented by no less than four different signs\r\nexpressing _k_ (No. 4), _k’_ (16), _k’h_ (19), and _kh_ (42): _d_ by\r\nthree different signs, _d_ (11), _d’h_ (22), and _dh_ (34). At the same\r\ntime it was beginning to be remarked that certain of these signs to\r\nwhich modifications of the same sound were ascribed were only to be found\r\nin combination with particular vowels. Lassen himself had pointed out in\r\nhis First Memoir of 1836 that _m_ (29) always preceded an _i_. Jacquet\r\nadded that _r_ (40) always occurred before _u_. Holtzmann also remarked\r\nthat 28 (𐎩), to which he gave the value of _g_, is always followed by\r\n_a_, and 19 _d_ by _i_.[551]\r\n\r\nThe merit of Hincks consists in this: that he was the first to point\r\nout that the various signs allotted to the same letter did not differ\r\nfrom each other by any modification of sound as Lassen supposed, and\r\nalso that their employment was regulated according to the vowel that\r\nsucceeded them. He accordingly divided the signs for these consonants\r\ninto two classes, according as they were followed by _a_, inherent or\r\nexpressed, and by _i_ or _u_; and he added _r_: the former he called\r\nprimary, and the latter secondary, consonants. Lassen, as we have said,\r\nwas of opinion that the secondary letters must have a somewhat different\r\nvalue, and in particular that they were all aspirated. He also thought\r\nthey might be used indifferently before any vowel. Thus, for example, he\r\nsupposed that the two signs for _m_ (𐎶 and 𐎷) might both be used before\r\n_i_, and that they expressed a slightly different sound. Hincks, on the\r\ncontrary, maintained that 𐎶 could never really open upon _i_; and when\r\nit appears to do so, as in the group 𐎶·𐎡, _a_ is always understood.\r\nThus 𐎷·𐎡 is ‘mi,’ but 𐎶·𐎡 is ‘mai’ or ‘mê,’ the secondary form of _m_\r\nbeing equivalent to its primary form; and he ascribed the existence\r\nin the alphabet of this peculiarity to a survival from a syllabic\r\nmode of writing. Its utility is, however, obvious, for with only three\r\nvowels—_a_, _i_ and _u_—it would otherwise be impossible to render the\r\nsounds _ê_ and _ô_ (_ai_—_au_). As, however, the consonants themselves\r\nwere of the same value, Hincks writes them with the same sign, and\r\ndiscards the _h_ which had till then been added to mark an imaginary\r\ndifference in the sound of the secondary consonants. This is precisely\r\nwhat Rawlinson did in his Supplementary Note, and for the same reason.\r\nHincks lays down the general rule that when a primary consonant replaces\r\na secondary consonant before _i_ or _u_ ‘an _a_ must be interposed either\r\nas a distinct syllable or as a guṇa to the vowel.’[552] This alteration\r\nled to a considerable modification in the method of transliteration, but\r\nits importance arose from the altered translation of which the words\r\nbecame susceptible. Thus, in the instance already given, ‘miy’ is the\r\ntermination of the first person singular present tense of the verb; while\r\n‘mey’ (properly ‘maiy’) is the enclitic pronoun used for _my_. So also\r\nthe words Lassen transliterates ‘utamija khsathram’ and renders ‘tum\r\nhoc regnum,’ when properly transliterated ‘utamê’ (‘utamaiy’) signify\r\n‘meumque regnum.’[553]\r\n\r\nHincks had also the merit of calling attention to the indiscriminate\r\naddition of _a_ by Lassen to words ending in _iy_ and _uw_. This\r\nlengthening of the syllable sometimes entirely obscured the sense—as in\r\n‘thatija’ which Lassen supposed to signify ‘generosus,’ and which is in\r\nfact the verb ‘he says.’[554]\r\n\r\nWhen we compare Hincks’s alphabet with Lassen’s (passing over the mere\r\nomission of the aspirates) we find that Hincks had only four incorrect\r\nvalues, as opposed to the six of Lassen. These were:\r\n\r\n  26 _z_ for _th_;\r\n  32 _zh(i)_ for _j(i)_;\r\n  33 _kh(u)_ for _m(u)_;\r\n  39 _p(r)_ for _f(a)_.\r\n\r\nTwo of these were already correctly given by Lassen (Nos. 26 and 39). On\r\nthe other hand, Hincks corrected three out of Lassen’s six wrong values:\r\n\r\n  16 _ch_ instead of Lassen’s _k’_;\r\n  19 _d(i)_ instead of Lassen’s _k’h_ (due to Holtzmann);\r\n  28 _j_ instead of Lassen’s _z’_.\r\n\r\nIt may be observed also that Hincks has correctly indicated all of\r\nwhat he termed the secondary consonants and distinguished between\r\nthose followed by _i_ and those followed by _u_. The others not so\r\ndistinguished are the primary consonants preceding _a_ inherent or\r\nexpressed.\r\n\r\nWhen Hincks read his paper in June, Rawlinson’s Memoir on the Behistun\r\nInscription had been already received by the Asiatic Society and was in\r\nthe printer’s hands. It was no easy task at that time to carry it through\r\nthe press. Cuneiform type had to be cast, and the expense and trouble it\r\ncaused were very great. The work was, however, looked forward to with\r\nthe greatest interest. After the appearance of Professor Lassen’s essay,\r\nin 1844, all the cuneiform inscriptions of the Persian column then known\r\nhad, as we have said, with one notable exception, been translated. There\r\nremained the great inscription at Behistun, which it was known Major\r\nRawlinson had copied and was at work upon. We have already narrated the\r\nsuccession of untoward circumstances that had delayed its publication\r\nfor seven years, from the time when two hundred lines had been prepared\r\nfor the press in 1839 down to the late autumn of 1846, when the completed\r\nwork was first made public. Meanwhile no other traveller appeared at all\r\ndisposed to anticipate him. There were indeed few who cared to undergo\r\nthe personal risk Rawlinson had so cheerfully faced, nor willing to\r\nexpend a thousand pounds upon the dangerous task, as he had so generously\r\ndone. Indeed down to 1884 only one other traveller subsequently\r\naccomplished the ascent.[555] In February 1846, Rawlinson forwarded a\r\ncomplete translation of the entire text to the Royal Asiatic Society. The\r\nremainder, with the cuneiform original and notes, followed at intervals\r\nin the course of the year. The editorial note, dated September 7, tells\r\nus that the text and the first five chapters of the Memoir had been\r\nalready received. The work appeared in four parts, of which the first\r\nthree form the tenth volume of the Society’s Journal. The first was\r\npublished in 1846, and contained eight plates, two representing the rock\r\nof Behistun and the figures sculptured upon it, executed by Lieutenant\r\nJones of the Indian Navy;[556] the others are devoted to the five columns\r\nand appendices which form the text. Then follow the transliteration and\r\ntwo translations, one in Latin and the other in English, with notes on\r\nthe state of the text. This was followed by the first two chapters of\r\nhis ‘Memoir on the Inscription’ to page 53. This portion of the work\r\nwas reviewed by Hincks, in the January number of the ‘Dublin University\r\nMagazine,’ 1847, and by Benfey in a pamphlet published at Leipzig in\r\nJanuary 1847. Part II. was published before the meeting of the Society\r\nin May 1847, and included the third chapter of the Memoir, treating\r\nof the cuneiform alphabet and the important Supplementary Note on the\r\npronunciation, pages 55 to 186.[557]\r\n\r\nPart III. was at the same time in the hands of the printer, and appeared\r\nlater in the year (1847). It contains Chapters IV. and V. of the Memoir.\r\nThe former gives a revised transliteration and translation of the text\r\nwith an Analysis; and the other a complete revised edition of all the\r\ninscriptions previously published by Lassen. Mr. Norris, the Assistant\r\nSecretary of the Asiatic Society, saw the whole of this complicated\r\nwork through the press, and he undertook to alter the transliteration\r\ngiven in Chapter IV. in accordance with the principles laid down in the\r\nSupplementary Note. For his services in this matter, he received a vote\r\nof thanks from the Society. ‘He unites,’ said the proposer, ‘more varied\r\nlearning and more rare and extensive research and intelligence than I\r\nhave ever seen combined in the same individual’;[558] and he subsequently\r\nattained an independent position in the first rank of cuneiform scholars.\r\n\r\nPart IV. was not published till 1849. It included the sixth chapter\r\nof the Memoir and treated of the Vocabulary, but the dissertation was\r\nnever completed. It breaks off in the middle of a sentence, when the\r\nwriter had not proceeded further than the words commencing with vowels\r\nand with consonants of the first three classes. It purports to give a\r\nfew brief etymological explanations, but in reality it is admirable as\r\na display of learning in many fields of knowledge, and it is especially\r\ninteresting for the explanation it affords of the reasons that led to\r\nthe determination of words of doubtful meaning. While he was engaged in\r\nthis work, he received Lassen’s Second Memoir. It did not reach him\r\ntill August 1845, when his own translations were completed and already\r\nbeyond the reach of alteration. He had little cause, however, to regret\r\nthe delay that arose from the difficulty in those times of ‘communicating\r\nbetween Bonn and Bagdad,’ for he could have derived small benefit from\r\nthe very inferior translations of his predecessor. In the philological\r\nbranch of the subject, however, he found the Memoir ‘of the greatest\r\nconvenience as a manual of reference,’ and his marginal notes show how\r\ncarefully he consulted it.[559]\r\n\r\nBy the publication of this work Major Rawlinson at length took his place\r\namong the cuneiform scholars of Europe. We have shown that the study was\r\nby that time far advanced, and most of the difficulties of the Persian\r\ncolumn were already surmounted. Rawlinson did not, therefore, put forward\r\nany pretension to original discovery in that department, but was, he\r\nsaid, ‘content to rest my present claims on the novelty and interest of\r\nmy translations.’[560] He hoped eventually to earn the higher distinction\r\nof an original discoverer, ‘according to the success that may attend my\r\nefforts to decipher the Median [Susian] and Babylonian inscriptions.’\r\nIt was not, however, without an effort that he presented himself in so\r\nmodest a garb upon this occasion. He was convinced that he had made each\r\nstep in the tedious process of decipherment by his own unaided effort;\r\nand in whatever light he might appear to the public, he was certainly an\r\noriginal discoverer to himself. He had no doubt that if Grotefend and\r\nLassen had never lived the world would have been indebted wholly to him\r\nfor the discovery, and, although we think he may have been influenced\r\nmore than he suspected by other scholars, there is no great improbability\r\nin supposing that his own ingenuity would have been quite equal to\r\ngrapple singly with the task.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding his avowed disclaimer, he still cherished the opinion\r\nthat he had really made some important contributions to the determination\r\nof the alphabet. On one occasion indeed he went so far as to claim the\r\npaternity, directly or indirectly, of at least ten characters, and he\r\nreferred to his correspondence with Burnouf and Lassen as the medium\r\nthrough which he had made his influence felt. It is clear, however, that\r\nin this he was entirely mistaken. According to his own admission, he\r\nknew as little of the Continental scholars as they did of him until his\r\nfirst communication to the Asiatic Society, which was received in March\r\n1838. It will be recollected that Burnouf and Lassen had published their\r\nMemoirs two years before; so neither of these could have been influenced\r\nby Rawlinson. It only remains to inquire whether he could have suggested\r\nany of the six values ascribed to Jacquet, whose essay appeared in the\r\ncourse of 1838. Here a comparison of dates is not sufficient in itself to\r\ndetermine the question. Rawlinson’s communication was known in London on\r\nMarch 14, and was submitted to the French Society on April 20. Jacquet\r\nbegan that very month to publish his criticism of Lassen, and his active\r\nmind was full of the subject. He was no doubt present at the meeting when\r\nRawlinson’s copy of the inscription was submitted to the Society, and\r\nthere was ample time for him to profit by any suggestions it contained\r\nin his future papers on the subject. We have, however, conclusive proof\r\nfrom Rawlinson’s own admission that the values of these six letters were\r\nnot then known to him. Nor could they have been communicated to Jacquet\r\nthrough his subsequent correspondence with Burnouf. Jacquet died in\r\nJuly 1838, and Rawlinson’s correspondence with Burnouf and Lassen did\r\nnot begin till the summer of that year.[561] From that period Rawlinson\r\nhimself accounts for all the letters in question. Writing after Jacquet’s\r\ndeath, he tells us in a letter to Burnouf that he had just found the\r\nvalue of 16 (𐎨) _ch_. Two other values, 26 (𐎰) _th_ and 41 (𐏃) _h_,\r\nhe fixed still later in the winter 1838-9; another, 27 (𐎹) _y_, he\r\nacknowledges he received from Lassen.[562] The sign 10 (𐎺) he also fixed\r\nin 1838-9; but he gave it the same value as Lassen had done in 1836, viz.\r\n_w_. In Germany _w_ was no doubt equivalent to its correct value _v_, but\r\nscarcely so to an English-speaking man, especially as he distinguishes\r\nit from his _v_ (𐎻) No. 15. The other letter, 40 (𐎽) _r_, was known\r\ncorrectly to Grotefend in 1837. With reference, therefore, to the six\r\nletters attributed to Jacquet, it is seen that none of them were due to\r\nthe influence of Rawlinson, either through his Memoir or subsequently by\r\ncorrespondence. One letter (_r_) was fixed before Rawlinson was known.\r\nThree others were first announced after Jacquet was dead (16, 26, 41).\r\nOne was wrong (10), and the other (27) he acknowledged to have borrowed\r\nfrom Lassen. It is impossible, therefore, to admit the pretension put\r\nforward by Rawlinson, that he could ‘fairly claim the paternity, either\r\ndirectly or indirectly, of at least ten characters’ on the ground\r\nthat ‘it was impossible to say by whom each individual letter became\r\nidentified.’ On the contrary, the history of the identification is plain\r\nenough, and there is no difficulty in assigning the proportion of merit\r\ndue to each discoverer. It was not till after the essays of Jacquet that\r\nRawlinson bore any share in the general progress of the study; and then\r\nnot more than four characters remained to be correctly identified.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen with what conspicuous success Rawlinson had found\r\nthe true values of two of these, so far back as 1838. One still gave\r\nLassen a great deal of trouble, and he had variously valued it as _k_\r\n(1836), _ich_ (1839), _k’h_ (1844). In his letter to Rawlinson he\r\npreferred to leave it undetermined (1839).[563] Rawlinson suggested that\r\nit had the sound of _t_ before _i_, which is so nearly correct and so\r\ngreat an improvement upon all previous attempts that it might almost be\r\nconceded to him as an approximate value if he had announced it earlier.\r\nHe acknowledges that he remained long in doubt concerning it, and\r\nthere is no evidence, as in the case of the other two letters, that he\r\nsuggested the emendation to Burnouf.[564] Before his alphabet appeared,\r\nin 1846, the true value had been already fixed by Holtzmann in 1845 as\r\n_d_ before _i_.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that Rawlinson had a real aptitude for unravelling this\r\nkind of puzzle. Only four letters were left to him by his predecessors;\r\nand of these he determined two correctly and one nearly correctly.\r\nThe fourth, 28 (𐎩) the _z_ of Jacquet, he improves to an approximate\r\ncorrect value _j’h_ in his first alphabet; and in his second he gives\r\nit correctly as _j_ before _a_: a correction made simultaneously by\r\nHincks. He may also claim the merit of having restored the sound of _k_\r\n(he writes _kh_) to 25 (𐎤). The value of this letter had long before\r\nbeen fixed by Grotefend, but since then it had passed through many\r\nvicissitudes. St. Martin thought it was _h_; Burnouf made it _q_; and\r\nLassen thought, in 1836, it stood for the _a_ in the diphthong _au_,\r\n_ô_, till at length, in 1844, he reluctantly adopted Burnouf’s _q_.\r\n\r\nTn addition to these services, Rawlinson contributed two new letters,\r\none of which, No. 43 (𐎵), _n_ before _u_, has taken a permanent place\r\nin the alphabet. The other (𐎾), _ñ_, is really a Susian letter with a\r\nnasal sound, and is found in the Persian column in only two proper names.\r\nOppert suggests that it may be the missing _l_; and Spiegel is disposed\r\nto agree.[565]\r\n\r\nIf we consult Rawlinson’s alphabet as it stood early in 1846, it will be\r\nseen that he was in possession of correct values for the thirty-three\r\nsigns in Niebuhr’s list, with the exception of two, 10 (𐎺) _w_ for _v_,\r\nand 19 (𐎮) _t_ for _d_, and both of these may be almost allowed to him as\r\napproximately correct. In the case of the first, indeed, we have already\r\nconceded it to Lassen, in consequence of the practical exclusion of _w_\r\nfrom the German language; and we have only denied it to Rawlinson because\r\nhe distinguishes it from his 15 (𐎻) _v_.\r\n\r\nWe have not included the addition of the aspirate among the number of\r\nerrors, where it indicated only an unimportant modification of a correct\r\nsound. It had its origin in the difficulty that was found in believing\r\nthat there could be more than one sign in the alphabet to express\r\nprecisely the same sound. We have seen that Hincks had just shown that\r\nthese signs do in fact express the same sound, and that their employment\r\ndepends solely upon the vowel that follows. After Major Rawlinson’s first\r\nalphabet was in print, he arrived, independently, as we have already\r\nstated, at precisely the same conclusion. He had long been struck with\r\nthe peculiarity that certain consonants are only to be found followed by\r\na particular vowel, and in his first alphabet he indicated five letters\r\nthus distinguished. These were: 19, _t_ with _i_; 29, _m_ with _i_;\r\n33, _m_ with _u_; 40, _r_ with _u_; 43, _n_ with _u_; and he observed\r\nespecially the affinity the vowel _i_ had for certain consonants—a\r\npeculiarity he noticed also in some of the Scythic languages.[566] When\r\nonce his attention was directed to these facts it was not long before he\r\nset himself to account for them. One of the most useful contributions\r\nto decipherment made by Lassen arose from the suggestion that an _a_\r\nis understood though not always expressed after a consonant, when not\r\nfollowed by another vowel. Indeed until this idea occurred to him the\r\nresult of decipherment was the apparition of a long series of words\r\nconsisting of an agglomeration of consonants which no living tongue could\r\npronounce. The next step to be made, resulted from the observation that\r\nsome letters were always followed by _i_ and others by _u_. A laborious\r\nclassification of each letter according as it was followed by each of\r\nthese vowels was therefore undertaken, and the result was sufficiently\r\nremarkable. It showed that in two cases in the grade of sonants (_d_ and\r\n_m_) there was a different sign according as the letter was followed\r\nby _a_, _i_, or _u_. Conversely, there were three cases in the grade\r\nof aspirates (_th_, _y_, _sh_), where the same sign might be found\r\nbefore any of the three vowels; and finally there were several cases in\r\nthe grade of surds (_k_, _t_, and _r_), where it was noticed that the\r\nsame sign was followed by either _a_ or _i_, and that a different sign\r\nwas used before _u_. Taking these facts into consideration, Rawlinson\r\nthought he observed sufficient regularity to justify him in formulating\r\nthe general law that, for some unexplained reason, the grade of surds\r\nin each class were expressed by two signs, one used before _a_ and _i_,\r\nthe other before _u_; the grade of aspirates by one sign only, equally\r\navailable before any of the three vowels; and the grade of sonants by\r\nthree signs, each applied to one vowel only. He admitted that there were\r\nnumerous exceptions to the rule; indeed, the class of dentals is the only\r\none where the series is complete, but the exceptions he was inclined to\r\nattribute chiefly to the incompleteness of the alphabet.[567]\r\n\r\nWhen the letters of Rawlinson’s original alphabet were distributed into\r\nthe various classes of gutturals, palatals, and so on, and among the\r\nsubdivisions of surds, aspirates, and sonants, they were found sufficient\r\nto suggest the existence of some such law in the cases that have been\r\nnamed. With Holtzmann’s correction of 19 (𐎮) from _t_ to _d_, he had the\r\nthree _d’s_ required to complete his sonants of the dental class. His\r\nown list gave him the three _m’s_ required for the sonants of the nasal\r\nclass; and he already knew that one was used only before _i_, and the\r\nother only before _u_. He knew also that the aspirates of three of the\r\nclasses were to be found indifferently before any vowel. In the case of\r\nthe surds, he had found that five of them (_k_ 𐎣, _ch_ 𐎨, _t_ 𐎫, _n_ 𐎴,\r\n_r_ 𐎼) are always to be found before either an _a_ or an _i_. He knew\r\nalso that his second sign for _n_ 𐎵 (43) and his second sign for _r_ 𐎽\r\nwere only to be found before _u_; and he observed that the signs he still\r\nread (𐎤) _kh_ and (𐎬) _th_ were also only found before _u_. It required,\r\ntherefore, no great effort to deprive them of their _h_, and to range\r\nthem with the others as the second signs in the surd grades for _k_ and\r\n_t_.\r\n\r\nOnce the existence of this law was inferred, Rawlinson was led to make\r\nother modifications in his original alphabet, in order to bring it\r\ninto strict conformity, and in every instance the alteration has been\r\nconfirmed. The following Table shows the distribution of the letters into\r\nthe various classes and grades, and the modifications they underwent.\r\nWhen they fail to comply with the supposed law, the deficiencies are left\r\nblank: when they violate it, the offence is marked by ‘!’.\r\n\r\nRAWLINSON’S ALPHABET, AFTER AUGUST 25, 1846[568]\r\n\r\n  _Gutturals._ Followed by _a_  (𐎠)  by _i_ (𐎡)  by _u_ (𐎢)\r\n      _k_ surd                   𐎣                𐎣                𐎤\r\n      _kh_ aspirate              𐎧                —                𐎧\r\n      _g_ sonant                 𐎥                ?                𐎦\r\n\r\n  _Palatals_\r\n      _ch_ surd                  𐎨                 𐎨               —\r\n      _j_ sonant                 𐎩                𐎪                —\r\n\r\n  _Dentals_\r\n      _t_ surd                   𐎫                𐎫                𐎬\r\n      _th_ aspirate              𐎰                𐎰                𐎰\r\n      _d_ sonant                 𐎭                𐎮                𐎯\r\n\r\n  _Labials_\r\n      _p_ surd                   𐎱                𐎱                𐎱!\r\n      _f_ aspirate               𐎳?               ?                ?\r\n      _b_ sonant                 𐎲                𐎲!               𐎲!\r\n\r\n  _Nasals_\r\n      _n_ surd                   𐎴                𐎴                𐎵\r\n      _ñ_ aspirate               𐎾                ?                ?\r\n      _m_ sonant                 𐎶                𐎷                𐎸\r\n\r\n  _Semi-vowels_ Followed by _a_ (𐎠)  by _i_ (𐎡)  by _u_ (𐎢)\r\n      _r_ surd                   𐎼                 𐎼               𐎽\r\n      _y_ aspirate               𐎹                𐎹                𐎹\r\n      _v_ sonant                 𐎺                𐎻                𐎺!\r\n\r\n  _Sibilants_\r\n      _s_ surd                   𐎿                𐎿                𐎿?!\r\n      _sh_ aspirate              𐏁                𐏁                𐏁\r\n      _z_ sonant                 𐏀                —                𐏀?!\r\n\r\n  _Aspirate_\r\n      _h_                        𐏃                𐏃                𐏃\r\n\r\n  Compound [Persian], _tř_\r\n  Doubtful final, [Persian]\r\n\r\nOne of the results of the classification of the consonants according to\r\nthe vowels that follow them was to introduce a considerable change in\r\nthe method of transliteration. It is only in exceptional cases that the\r\n_a_, following a consonant, is found in the text, but its inherence is\r\ninferred. When, therefore, an _i_ or _u_ immediately follows a consonant\r\nwith an inherent _a_, instead of transliterating as formerly such a group\r\nas 𐎥 𐎡 _gi_ and 𐎥 𐎢 _gu_, they are now written _gai_ and _gau_; and\r\nthis modification has materially assisted the explanation of the words\r\nin which such combinations occur. An interesting proof of the accuracy\r\nof this system is afforded by the word ‘Kurus,’ which was so long an\r\nobject of contention. The genitive is denoted by the insertion of an\r\n_a_—‘Kuraus.’ The letter 𐎽 (_r_), which is followed by _u_, is used for\r\nthe nominative ‘Kurus’; but the letter 𐎼 (_r_), which has an inherent _a_\r\nis substituted in the genitive. Thus:\r\n\r\n  Nom. _Kurus_,  𐎤 · 𐎢 · 𐎽 · 𐎢 · 𐏁\r\n                 k   u   r   u   s\r\n  Gen. _Kuraus_, 𐎤 · 𐎢 · 𐎼 · 𐎢 · 𐏁\r\n                 k   u  r(a) u   s\r\n\r\nThe interchange of these two signs in ‘Kurus’ finally disposed of a\r\nsupposition started by Burnouf and supported so lately as Holtzmann,[569]\r\nthat 𐎽 might be _l_, and that the Persians pronounced the name of their\r\ngreat king ‘Kulus.’\r\n\r\nConsiderations of the same kind greatly assisted Rawlinson in rectifying\r\nsome of his values. For example, in the case of 𐎦, which he had hitherto\r\nread _gh_, he found that it replaced 𐎥 the _g_ before _a_, in order\r\nto form the locative singular ‘Mar_gau_w;’ and consequently he had no\r\nhesitation ‘in placing the two characters, not merely in the same class,\r\nbut in the same grade of that class.’ It is therefore now found among the\r\ngutturals as _g_ before _u_.[570]\r\n\r\nPrecisely the same considerations led to the rectification of 28 (𐎩)\r\n_j’h_ to _j_. He found the locative of Susiana (‘uwajaiya’) written 𐎩 ·\r\n𐎡, i.e. _ji_, which he knew from grammatical considerations must stand\r\nfor _jai_; and he therefore concluded that 𐎩 is _j_ before _a_; which is\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\nA farther result of this classification is to supply the sounds of the\r\nmissing vowels _e_ and _o_, for when _i_ or _u_ follow a consonant\r\nwith an inherent _a_, the diphthongs _ai_ and _au_ are produced, which\r\ncorrespond phonetically and grammatically to the diphthongs _ê_ and _ô_\r\nin Sanscrit.[571] Such were the results communicated by Rawlinson in\r\nhis Supplementary Note, which, as we have seen, crossed the detailed\r\naccount of Hincks’s paper on the same subject. It was received in London\r\non October 8, and its substance was read at a meeting of the Society\r\non December 6, and noticed in the ‘Athenæum’ of December 19.[572] The\r\nalterations in the method of transliteration required by the new\r\nsystem were, as we have said, carried out under the supervision of Mr.\r\nNorris.[573]\r\n\r\nRawlinson has not drawn up a formal grammar of Old Persian, but he\r\nloses no opportunity of comparing its forms with Sanscrit and Zend,\r\nand pointing out wherein they agree and wherein they differ. He shows\r\nthat the initial letter _a_, so frequently employed, is used to express\r\nthe temporal augment in the past tenses of verbs, and according to the\r\nanalogy of the Sanscrit it is short. But the short _a_ of Sanscrit\r\nterminations is changed into long _a_ in the cuneiform; and the mute\r\nterminal consonants of the former are usually omitted, as in the endings\r\n‘as,’ ‘at,’ ‘an,’ ‘am,’ a rule applicable to both nouns and verbs. He\r\nshows also that the suffixes in _i_, so common in Sanscrit and Zend,\r\nare all lengthened into ‘iya’; a rule also applicable to the terminal\r\n_u_.[574] If he had finished his chapter on the Vocabulary, the student\r\nmight have been able from it to put together a complete grammar. Under\r\ntheir initial letters we find ‘adam,’ the personal pronoun ‘ego’;\r\n‘aniya,’ ‘alius’; the two demonstrative pronouns ‘ava,’ ‘that,’ and\r\n‘iyam,’ ‘this’;[575] correctly traced through all their cases so far\r\nas they were known—and the same is done for the cases of the verbs\r\n‘am‘iy,’ ‘I am,’ and ‘thah,’ ‘to say’;[576] and in each he shows the\r\nclose similarity they exhibit to Sanscrit and Zend. In his notes to the\r\ntranslation he dwells especially on the construction of the sentences and\r\nupon the historical questions raised by the subject-matter of the text.\r\nHe gives an elaborate analysis of each letter of the cuneiform alphabet,\r\ncomparing its use and pronunciation with those of other languages. He\r\ncan draw a wealth of illustration at pleasure from the kindred languages\r\nof Sanscrit, Zend, Pehlevi, Persian, as well as from Pali, Devanagari,\r\nHebrew, Chaldee, Syriac, and Turkish; and although he displays an amount\r\nof knowledge that is truly surprising, he defers with unaffected humility\r\nto ‘the more experienced philologist.’[577] He classifies Old Persian as\r\nbelonging to ‘the Arian type, resembling Sanscrit very closely in its\r\ngrammatical structure; but in its orthographical development more nearly\r\napproximating to the Zend: while in the peculiarity of organisation which\r\nrequires the juxtaposition of certain consonants with certain vowels it\r\nexhibits something of a Scythic character.’[578] He was not disposed to\r\nadmit the antiquity then beginning to be claimed for Zend. He thought\r\nthat in comparison with Old Persian it was modern. He imagined that the\r\nlatter became gradually extinct after the age of Alexander, and that\r\nit was succeeded by Zend and Pehlevi, the former as a hieratic and the\r\nother as a demotic language but both derived from it.[579] He was clear\r\nat least that Old Persian could never have descended from Zend, though\r\nhe reluctantly admits the possibility of their contemporary existence.\r\nHis unwillingness to allow the antiquity of Zend was due in great measure\r\nto the legendary character of the Zendavesta, a book which he considered\r\ncould not have been written till after the cuneiform Persian had been\r\nentirely forgotten. Otherwise, he said, ‘the priesthood could neither\r\nhave had the audacity nor the desire to darken authentic history by the\r\ndistorted and incomplete allusions to Jemshid and the Kayanian monarchs\r\nwhich are found in the Vendidád Sadé and in the ancient hymns.’[580]\r\n\r\nThe appearance of Rawlinson’s work was received with feelings of\r\nenthusiasm in Germany. The reproach that England had hitherto neglected\r\nthe cuneiform records was at length effaced, and in such a manner as to\r\nentitle her to claim the first place in the roll of discovery. Benfey\r\ndeclared that few, if any, of the contributions made in recent times in\r\nthe field of Oriental research could compare with it in importance.[581]\r\nMajor Rawlinson, he says, displays an extraordinary aptitude for\r\ndecipherment, and an accuracy and depth of philological learning that\r\nrender it peculiarly fortunate that such an important document should\r\nhave fallen into his hands. In mere length, the inscription exceeds by\r\nmore than a hundred lines all those published by Lassen put together.\r\nIt consists of five columns of about four hundred and ten lines, and,\r\nalthough there is considerable repetition, it nevertheless offers a great\r\nvariety of words and phrases which added immensely to the knowledge\r\npreviously acquired.[582] One great difficulty with which he had to\r\ngrapple was the very imperfect state of the text. A glance over the\r\nplates will show the numerous blanks left in the writing in consequence\r\nof injury to the rock. Rawlinson’s copy was so carefully executed that he\r\ncommitted only one serious error, the omission of a line in the fourth\r\ncolumn. The other imperfections are due entirely to the ravages of time.\r\nIn the first column there is a large fissure on the right hand, extending\r\nfrom the top to the twenty-fifth line, and again from the sixty-third\r\nline to the end, besides numerous occasional gaps elsewhere. But the\r\nsecond column is in a much worse condition. ‘A fissure, varying in\r\nbreadth, caused by the percolation of water, bisects it and destroys the\r\ncontinuity of the writing throughout its whole extent.’[583] The third\r\nis nearly perfect, except at the bottom, where several lines are wholly\r\nlost. The fourth column is worse than the second; ‘a fissure transects\r\nthe tablet longitudinally,’ and in the lower half ‘the rock is more or\r\nless broken by the trickling of the water.’ But when we come to the\r\nfifth, we find ‘a state of such deplorable mutilation that it would be\r\nwaste of time and ingenuity to undertake an analysis of the text, or\r\nto attempt anything like a connected and intelligible translation.’ In\r\nthe face of these difficulties he was obliged to have recourse to very\r\nelaborate and ingenious restorations. At the end of the second column,\r\nfor instance, he found the Susian copy perfect, and this enabled him\r\nto ‘restore’ the Persian text. It is one of the first instances of a\r\nlong translation from the Susian, and his version of it turned out\r\nafterwards to be correct.[584] In the numerous repetitions that occur so\r\nfrequently, he found a safe guide in other passages of the inscriptions.\r\nSometimes, however, he had to work on much less solid foundation, as when\r\nhe sought help from other sentences that were only ‘of nearly similar\r\nconstruction’; or when his restoration was ‘generally borne out by the\r\ncontext’; or merely by considerations of ‘grammatical propriety.’ In\r\nsuch cases he could never arrive at more than a high probability. He had\r\nfrequently to measure the length of a blank and then tax his memory to\r\nsupply one or more words with the required number of letters that would\r\nfit into the vacant place and at the same time make sense. Sometimes,\r\nas in the fourth column, the sense was so obscure that he feared his\r\n‘restorations will be considered rather bold than felicitous.’[585]\r\nOccasionally his courage failed him altogether, and he was obliged to\r\nconfess that ‘I cannot restore the [passage] even conjecturally.’ It\r\nis remarkable how uniformly successful his ‘conjectural restorations’\r\nwere found to be. He imposed the most admirable restraint upon the\r\nintuitive faculty with which he was so eminently gifted; and his\r\nemendations exhibit a patience and sobriety that many scholars engaged\r\nin similar work might advantageously study. When he had surmounted the\r\nimperfections of the text so far as possible, he set himself to the task\r\nof translation, and achieved the most notable success in this department\r\nof literature. When we consider that he had to unravel the intricacies of\r\nlong sentences, determine the grammatical relations of multitudes of new\r\nwords and fix their meaning by a patient comparison with Zend or Sanscrit\r\nanalogies, the unfailing divination he displays is absolutely marvellous.\r\nA careful comparison of this first translation with that now accepted as\r\ncorrect will show comparatively few alterations, although the labours of\r\nmany scholars have since been devoted to a rigorous study of the same\r\ntext. The main body of the translation remains the same, word for word,\r\ndown to the minutest particulars. Some doubtful passages, concerning\r\nwhich Rawlinson himself entertained doubts, have been cleared up; but it\r\nrarely happens even in these that the original translation was in fault\r\nas to the general meaning.\r\n\r\nThe long list of commentators begins with Benfey, whose tract on the\r\nsubject was sent to the press in January 1847, when he could only have\r\nseen the first part of Rawlinson’s work. Some of Benfey’s suggestions\r\nhave been accepted, others definitely rejected. A few instances will\r\nillustrate the nature and extent of the earliest attempt at revision.\r\nAlmost the first error occurs in Column I. par. 10, where we find:\r\n‘The troubles of the state ceased which Bardius excited.’ Rawlinson\r\nwarns us that ‘this sentence cannot be read with any certainty,’ on\r\naccount of a blank in the inscription, and the doubt attaching to the\r\nword ‘azada.’ Benfey derives this word from the Sanscrit ‘ajatá,’ which\r\nsignifies ‘deprived of children,’ and he translates the passage: ‘The\r\nkingdom was deprived of heirs because Bardius was killed.’[586] But this\r\nalteration turned out to be quite unauthorised. ‘Azda,’ as the word\r\nis now written, is identified with the Armenian ‘azd,’ ‘information,’\r\ncorresponding to the Sanscrit ‘addhâ,’ ‘certain’; and Rawlinson himself\r\ncorrected the passage in 1873 to ‘It was not known to the state that\r\nBardius was killed.’ The accepted version given by Spiegel is ‘The army\r\nhad no information that Bardius was killed.’[587] Soon after, we are\r\ntold that ‘Cambyses, unable to endure his [misfortunes], died’ (par.\r\n11). Benfey attributes his death to ‘overwhelming anger’ (übergrossem\r\nZorn); but Oppert showed that the word really means ‘suicide.’ In 1873,\r\nRawlinson had made the rectification himself.[588] Not more happy was\r\nthe substitution of ‘Liebet mich’ for the often repeated exclamation\r\nRawlinson renders ‘Hail to thee!’ and which properly signifies ‘Go\r\nforth!’ as Rawlinson said in 1873.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, some instances where the commentator makes a\r\nuseful correction. The erroneous reading, ‘he would frequently address\r\nthe state’ (par. 13), he altered to ‘er möchte das Reich mit Macht\r\nvernichten,’ which approaches Spiegel, ‘er möchte viele Leute tödten,’\r\nor, as Rawlinson said in 1873, ‘he slew many people.’ So also the passage\r\n‘afterwards Dadarses remained away from me in the field’ (Col. II. par.\r\n9), is improved to ‘dann erwartete mich dem Befehl gemäss Dadarses.’\r\nThis Rawlinson changed in 1873 to ‘afterwards Dadarses waited for me\r\nthere,’ the accepted version being ‘dort erwartete mich Dadarses so\r\nlange’ etc. It will be observed that the critic was himself liable to\r\nfall into superfluous additions not far removed from error. Sometimes,\r\nhowever, he avoided this trap, as when he substituted ‘he lied’ (Col.\r\nIV. par. 1) for Rawlinson’s ‘impostor,’ and ‘if you so think’ (par. 5)\r\nfor ‘if it should be thus kept up.’ But in a large proportion of cases\r\nBenfey follows his leader into error with perfect complacency. In one\r\nor two places Rawlinson is obliged to confess that the difficulties are\r\nso great that translation is almost impossible. One of these occurs in\r\nthe description of the religious reform after the death of Gomates,\r\nthe Magian (Col. I. par. 14). Referring to this passage, he says: ‘Of\r\nseveral of the most important words the orthography is doubtful; of\r\nothers the etymology is almost impenetrable, and the construction,\r\nmoreover, in some parts renders the division into sentences a matter\r\nof serious embarrassment.’[589] But the difficulties have been found\r\nalmost as insuperable by his successors. They have not been able to\r\nderive assistance from the Susian and Babylonian columns, where the\r\ndifficulties are even greater. The meaning of some words still remains\r\na mystery, and even the general drift of the passage is open to\r\ndiscussion. Spiegel[590] warns his readers that the explanation of the\r\nwhole paragraph is still so uncertain that no opinion as to the religious\r\nhistory of the times can be prudently based upon it. But such passages\r\nas these are fortunately of rare occurrence; and from the moment of\r\nRawlinson’s publication the contents of the inscription were known as\r\nthoroughly as they are at the present day. The careful study of two\r\ngenerations of scholars has changed a word here and a word there, and\r\ncleared up the meaning of a few doubtful passages, but in all substantial\r\nrespects the translation remains unaltered.\r\n\r\nRawlinson’s revised translation of the inscriptions published two years\r\nbefore by Lassen forms the concluding chapter of his Memoir. We have\r\nalready had occasion to contrast the merits and demerits of the two\r\ntranslators. Rawlinson’s transliteration presents an entirely modern\r\nappearance in consequence of the correctness of the values of so many\r\nsigns. There are still a few errors, owing chiefly to the prolongation\r\nof the final syllable in such words as ‘thatiya,’ ‘tyaia,’ and others,\r\nan error already signalled by Hincks. But these are of small importance.\r\nAs regards the translations, he brought from the study of the Behistun\r\nrecord a knowledge of the language that no one else then possessed, and\r\nhe was able at once to resolve difficulties that had baffled all previous\r\nattempts. Such expressions as ‘generosus [sum]’ finally disappeared for\r\nthe correct rendering ‘he says.’ Sentences that were hitherto entirely\r\nmisapprehended now appear in their correct form. ‘The son of Arcis’ gives\r\nplace to ‘the son of a Persian, an Arian of Arian descent.’ The last\r\nparagraph of the same inscription is satisfactorily explained. Even where\r\nhe fell short of success, as in the end of the I inscription, he made\r\nimportant contributions to the elucidation of intricate passages.\r\n\r\nRawlinson added the inscription on the Venice vase, not known to Lassen.\r\nIt had been recently published by Longpérier in the ‘Revue Archéologique’\r\n(1844), who thought it should be referred to Artaxerxes I. Rawlinson\r\ntranslated it ‘Artaxerxes the King,’ and assigned it to Artaxerxes Ochus.\r\nOpinion has since been divided upon the subject; Spiegel and Menant\r\nfollow Longpérier; Oppert and Weissbach follow Rawlinson.\r\n\r\nVery few additional inscriptions in Old Persian have been brought to\r\nlight since the date of Rawlinson’s Memoir. But a good deal of labour has\r\nbeen spent in clearing up the doubtful passages in those already known.\r\nIn some cases the text was, as we have said, so much mutilated as to\r\ndefy intelligible translation. This was the case with the fifth column\r\nof the Behistun; and Rawlinson thought it best to omit it altogether\r\nfrom his revised edition of 1873.[591] This diffidence, however, may\r\nhave stimulated M. Oppert to attempt a restoration of the text. We have\r\nalready described the process followed by Rawlinson. It consisted in\r\nselecting a word or words containing the number of letters required to\r\nfit into the space left vacant by the erasure of the text, and which\r\nwould at the same time make some kind of sense. It is obvious how\r\nmuch of the success of this operation will depend upon the ingenuity\r\nof the restorer; and still more upon the restraint he exercises over\r\nhis imagination. No one is more distinguished than M. Oppert for the\r\ningenuity of his conjectural restorations; and the column that Rawlinson\r\nabandoned as hopeless appears in Oppert’s edition as the ‘Complementary\r\nBehistun Text,’ and in a comparatively perfect condition. In this case\r\nhe could receive no assistance from the translations, because both the\r\nother columns are destroyed; and not much by comparison, for there\r\nare few parallel passages. His work is, therefore, the more admirable\r\nas a display of the imaginative faculty. But his reading has not been\r\naccepted by Menant or Spiegel, or by Weissbach.[592] No doubt we owe the\r\n‘Testament of Darius at Naksh-i-Rustam’ to the same method which appears\r\nto have been exercised upon the few lines copied by Westergaard from the\r\nlong inscription below the one known and which Spiegel declares it is\r\nclearly impossible to translate.[593] One of the three short inscriptions\r\nengraved above the figures of the Tomb has also given rise to some\r\ndiscussion. Mr. Tasker, an English traveller, sent them to Rawlinson, by\r\nwhom they were published in the ‘Journal of the Asiatic Society,’ and an\r\nimproved version appeared some time afterwards.[594] Even at that period\r\nconsiderable difference of opinion existed as to the meaning of at least\r\none of these short legends. According to Rawlinson, Norris, and Oppert,\r\nAspathines is the ‘keeper of the arrows’ of King Darius; but Norris adds\r\n‘chamberlain’ and Oppert ‘quiver-bearer.’ Elsewhere Oppert translates it\r\nquite differently: ‘Aspathines, minister of King Darius, who makes the\r\nlaw observed.’ Spiegel’s version is: ‘Aspacanâ des Königs Darius genosse,\r\nZügelhalter (?).’[595]\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1846, when Rawlinson’s ‘Memoir’ was passing through\r\nthe press, Dr. Frederick Hitzig published a tract on the Persian Text\r\nof the Tomb Inscription of Darius; but his translation shows little\r\nadvance beyond the point reached by Lassen.[596] The edition of the\r\nPersian inscriptions by Theodore Benfey made its appearance early in\r\n1847. His transliteration suffers from having been made before the\r\nmethod of writing explained by Hincks and Rawlinson in the previous\r\nyear had become generally known. We have already sufficiently noticed\r\nBenfey’s translations, which show considerable improvement on those of\r\nLassen, but fall far short of the comparative excellence obtained by\r\nRawlinson. In the course of the summer, another writer appeared whose\r\nname has been already mentioned and who was destined to occupy a very\r\nimportant place in the future history of Cuneiform Research. M. Oppert\r\nwas born in Hamburg in 1825, and studied successively at Heidelberg, Bonn\r\nand Berlin. At Bonn he was a pupil of Lassen, and to this circumstance\r\nprobably we owe his early interest in cuneiform and the publication of\r\na tract on the subject at the age of twenty-two. The promising youth\r\nwas precluded by his Jewish faith from holding a professorship in\r\nGermany, and consequently he went to Paris in 1847. His later writings\r\nhave all appeared in the French language, and for this reason he is\r\ngenerally included among the number of French scholars, of whom, till\r\nquite recent years, he was by far the ablest representative.[597] So\r\nfar as we are aware, the pamphlet on the ‘Lautsystem des Altpersischen’\r\nwas his first effort in this department of knowledge.[598] In it he\r\nexplains the principle that regulates the employment of the consonants\r\nin substantially the same manner as Hincks and Rawlinson had done in the\r\nprevious year. He had evidently arrived at his conclusion independently,\r\nand it is remarkable that he was not better informed of the progress\r\nthat had recently been made. It might be supposed that the attention of\r\neveryone interested in the subject would be directed to the appearance\r\nof Rawlinson’s ‘Memoir,’ which was then eagerly expected. It was in fact\r\npublished before May 1847, and Oppert’s tract was not sent to press till\r\nJuly.\r\n\r\nWith the publication of Rawlinson’s Memoir, in 1846-7, the decipherment\r\nof the Persian inscriptions may be considered accomplished. In 1850,\r\nhe could write that there ‘are probably not more than twenty words in\r\nthe whole range of the Persian cuneiform records upon the meaning,\r\ngrammatical condition or etymology of which any doubt or difference of\r\nopinion can at present be said to exist.’[599] The value of his own\r\ncontribution to the general result received the fullest recognition.\r\nProfessor Max Müller declared to Canon Rawlinson that, ‘thanks mainly\r\nto your brother, we have now as complete a knowledge of the grammar,\r\nconstruction and general character of the ancient Persian language as\r\nwe have of Latin.’[600] He was greeted as the Champollion of the new\r\ndecipherment, a position he has retained to a large extent in Germany and\r\nFrance. So late as 1895, M. Oppert found occasion to remark that, ‘after\r\nRawlinson it was only possible for other scholars to obtain gleanings\r\nin the field of Persian cuneiform interpretation.’[601] In his own\r\ncountry, however, he seems to have suffered for a time from the singular\r\naffectation that was so long in fashion, of looking to Germany alone for\r\nall the springs of knowledge. As a matter of fact, in this department at\r\nleast, few Germans, with the exception of Grotefend, made any important\r\ncontribution. Rask, Lassen, Westergaard, were all Scandinavians, and\r\nit is certain that for many years Rawlinson continued to be the source\r\nwhence Continental writers drew most largely; and the neglect into\r\nwhich he fell at home occasioned the surprise of at least one eminent\r\nFrenchman. ‘Young English and Germans,’ says M. Oppert, ‘pretend not\r\nto know him. An Englishman once told me he had never read a line of\r\nRawlinson. I replied: “I supposed just so; if you had read him, your\r\npapers would be less imperfect than they are.”’[602] This testimony to\r\nthe great services of Sir Henry Rawlinson is given by the scholar who for\r\nmany years occupied by far the most prominent position among Continental\r\nwriters upon cuneiform subjects, and who has himself contributed largely\r\nto the progress of the study.\r\n\r\nIn 1851, M. Oppert undertook a complete revision of the whole series of\r\nAchaemenian inscriptions. The work appeared in the ‘Journal Asiatique,’\r\nbetween February 1851 and February 1852, and was afterwards published in\r\na separate form.[603] He introduced a considerable number of alterations,\r\nin both the transliteration and translation, and, so far as we have\r\nnoticed, a large proportion of them have been accepted. He criticised\r\nsome of Rawlinson’s opinions, but rarely with asperity, and he generously\r\nacknowledges that the English scholar ‘a grandement mérité de l’histoire\r\ndu genre humain.’[604] He subsequently revised his own translations for\r\nhis book on the ‘Expédition en Mésopotamie,’ published in 1858. In the\r\nsame year Rawlinson made an amended version of the Behistun Inscription\r\nfor the edition of Herodotus published by his brother; and again in 1873\r\nfor the ‘Records of the Past.’[605] The other inscriptions were once\r\nmore revised by Oppert in 1877 for the same useful publication.[606] But\r\nmeanwhile a complete edition of the whole Persian inscriptions had been\r\npublished by Spiegel in Germany in 1862,[607] and in France in 1872, by\r\nM. Menant.[608] The latest publications on the subject that have come\r\nunder our notice are the valuable treatises on the languages of the first\r\nand second columns by Weissbach,[609] and of the third column by Dr.\r\nBezold,[610] accompanied in each case by a revised text, transliteration\r\nand translation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nDECIPHERMENT OF THE SECOND OR SUSIAN COLUMN—WESTERGAARD TO OPPERT—A.D.\r\n1844-52\r\n\r\n\r\nThe signal success that had been achieved in the decipherment of the\r\nPersian column of the Achaemenian inscriptions greatly facilitated\r\nthe accomplishment of the difficult task that still remained. In the\r\nother two columns it was comparatively easy, especially in the short\r\ninscriptions, to identify the combinations of signs that corresponded to\r\nthe proper names in the Persian, and to check them by their recurrence\r\nin the positions where they were again to be expected. The satisfactory\r\napplication of this process left no doubt that the writing in both\r\ncolumns was from left to right; and that they were translations of the\r\nsame text. When the groups of characters composing the proper names\r\nwere ascertained, the next process was to separate them into letters\r\nor syllables, and to identify each with the corresponding letter in\r\nPersian. The result of this inquiry was to show clearly that the writing\r\nwas partly syllabic and to raise the suspicion that it was also partly\r\nideographic. It was seen that the signs were too numerous to be limited\r\nto an alphabet, and that long words could be expressed with comparatively\r\nfew signs. In some cases its ideographic character was illustrated by the\r\noccurrence of only one sign to represent an entire word—such as ‘King.’\r\nIt was also observed that in the second column a vertical wedge usually\r\npreceded proper names as a determinative.\r\n\r\nFrom the time when Niebuhr pointed out that there were three essentially\r\ndifferent styles of writing, and that each style was uniformly reproduced\r\nin the same relative position in all the inscriptions, the subject had\r\ngiven rise to much speculation. It was at first thought that the three\r\ncolumns repeated the same text in the same language written in different\r\ncharacters.[611] Grotefend, however, recognised that the languages also\r\nwere different, but he thought they were dialects closely related to\r\neach other. The first, as we have seen, he considered to be Zend, which\r\nhe called the Median language; the second he thought was Parsi, or the\r\nlanguage of the Persians; and the third another dialect of Persian,\r\npossibly Pehlevi.[612] Subsequently he changed the order of the last two,\r\nand described them respectively as resembling Pehlevi and Parsi.[613]\r\nAs regards the signs, Münter thought that in the second column they\r\nwere syllabic and in the third ‘hieroglyphic’; Tychsen and Grotefend\r\nthought that both had signs for vowels and consonants, which were at\r\ntimes replaced by an ideogram. Grotefend further saw that the second\r\nincluded signs for the combination of a consonant and vowel; the third he\r\nconsidered had no vowel signs, but used signs for the triple combination\r\nof consonant, vowel and consonant.[614] He entirely rejected the idea\r\nthat either system was purely ideographic. In 1824, he prepared a Table\r\nfor the third edition of Heeren, showing some words that corresponded to\r\neach other in the three languages. The inscriptions he selected were the\r\nG of Niebuhr, the inscriptions at Murgab and on the Caylus vase. These\r\nhe arranged word for word in parallel columns opposite to one another.\r\nHe used a full stop to indicate the combination of wedges that went to\r\nform each letter or syllable; indeed at that period it required scarcely\r\nless skill to divide the words into letters than to distinguish the words\r\nthemselves. No attempt was made to assign values to the characters, and\r\nfor many years no farther progress was made. In 1837 he still thought\r\nthe three columns represented dialects of Old Persian, though they might\r\nnot exactly correspond to Zend, Pehlevi and Parsi. The two first he\r\nconsidered nearer to each other as regards language; but he remarked that\r\nthe two latter presented a closer resemblance to one another as regards\r\nthe writing. Still he said the resemblance was by no means so close as\r\nthat between the third column and the Babylonian inscriptions. He saw\r\nindeed that the writing of the third column was a mere simplification of\r\nthe Babylonian; and he hazarded the useful conjecture that the writing of\r\nthe second might be only an arbitrary modification of the third. He would\r\nnot even yet admit that either could be, strictly speaking, described as\r\nsyllabic; and he entirely rejected the idea that the third was a Semitic\r\nlanguage.[615]\r\n\r\nBut the study was now upon the point of entering on an entirely new\r\nphase. We have already seen the success with which Burnouf and Lassen\r\napplied the discovery made by Grotefend to the long list of names in the\r\nI inscription. The visit paid in 1843 by Westergaard to Naksh-i-Rustam\r\nresulted in the recovery of a farther list of provinces from the Tomb\r\nof Darius. On his return to Germany, he made over his copy of the first\r\ncolumn to Lassen, who was best qualified to turn it to account, and he\r\ndevoted himself to an attempt to decipher the language of the second\r\ncolumn. The result appeared in the ‘Zeitschrift für die Kunde des\r\nMorgenlandes’ of 1844; and the same year, in English, in the ‘Mémoires\r\ndes Antiquaires du Nord.’[616] In 1845, the Memoir was republished in\r\nGerman, along with Lassen’s Second Memoir, and this, as the latest, must\r\nbe regarded as the most authoritative version.[617] The investigation\r\nis based upon an analysis of the various proper names contained in the\r\ninscriptions. Westergaard began with the well-known names of the Kings\r\nwhich Grotefend had turned to such good account, and afterwards reviewed\r\nthose of the provinces recently deciphered by Lassen. From these he\r\nobtained a sufficient number of values to attempt a transliteration of\r\nthe more common words occurring in the Persian version, and especially\r\nin the well-known form that opens so many of the inscriptions. He has\r\ngiven us a transliteration of this passage, which is the first ever\r\nmade into Roman characters of a Susian inscription.[618] His work was\r\nnecessarily based upon Lassen’s defective decipherment of the Persian\r\nsigns; and it was therefore inevitable that it should reproduce the\r\nsame erroneous values. He transliterated all the various inscriptions,\r\nbeginning with those of Xerxes as the shortest and simplest, and\r\nproceeding to those of Darius, including the one at Naksh-i-Rustam, which\r\nhe was the first to copy.[619] It is curious to compare the earliest\r\nattempts at transliteration with those subsequently made by Oppert\r\nand Weisbach. It will be seen that few of the words in his glossary\r\ncould now be recognised. He had little opportunity of displaying his\r\nskill as a translator, for in this department he implicitly followed\r\nLassen’s rendering of the corresponding Persian column, and we find the\r\nsame errors in both, from ‘Arça’ downwards; but he concludes with the\r\nK inscription, which has no Persian counterpart, and here he achieved\r\na respectable success. He was able to make out sufficient to show that\r\nDarius laid claim to the foundation of the Persepolitan platform.[620] In\r\nthe German edition he omits his adventurous transliterations (as well as\r\nthe declination of Ku, ‘king,’ which it will surprise some scholars to\r\nhear takes the forms of ‘Kuyoni’ in the accusative singular, and ‘Kuthin’\r\nor ‘Kuthrar’ in the genitive plural), and he has consequently lessened\r\nthe interest, if not the value, of that work.[621]\r\n\r\nThe result of his investigations was to show that the language was partly\r\nalphabetical and partly syllabic. Down to 1837, Grotefend had recognised\r\nabout sixty different signs.[622] Westergaard rightly calculated, from\r\nthe relation of the vowels to the consonants, that they must exceed\r\na hundred, but his actual identification only reached eighty-two. He\r\nnoticed two other probable groups, but he was unable to decide whether\r\nthey formed one sign or two. One of them has now gained admission.[623]\r\nIn consequence of the great care he exercised in the collation of his\r\ncopies only four defective signs found their way into his list.[624] He\r\nnoticed the recurrence of twelve other signs, which he ascribed to the\r\nerror of the copyist, though he thought three of them might be genuine.\r\nIt turned out that three were genuine, but only one of those that seemed\r\nto him likely to be so.[625] In addition to the determinative sign before\r\nproper names, which Grotefend had pointed out, he recognised another, the\r\nhorizontal wedge, which is sometimes interchangeable with it. It will\r\nremain a curiosity in the history of decipherment that Westergaard should\r\nhave gone out of his way to declare that the words for God, Ormuzd and\r\nHeaven were not preceded by a determinative—‘their importance being, no\r\ndoubt, thought too great to need any such distinction.’[626] He, in fact,\r\nmistook the determinative sign itself for the vowel which happens to\r\nprecede his rendering of these three names.\r\n\r\nHe thought he had discovered signs for six vowels (_a_, _â_, _i_, _e_,\r\n_u_ and _o_), and eighteen consonants.[627] Of the former only one (_u_)\r\nturned out to be correct. His _a_ and _i_ have both syllabic values (_an_\r\nand _in_). His long _â_ is a defective sign (No. 10). His _e_ should\r\nbe _i_ and his _o_ an _a_. Only four of his consonants were ultimately\r\nfound to be used as alphabetical signs, and for these his values are\r\ncorrect (_t_, _kh_, _s_ and _m_). A few of the others represented correct\r\nconsonantal values, though used syllabically. For example, his _p_ is\r\n_ap_, his _r_ is _ra_, his _s_ is _as_, his _n_ is _na_. He was more\r\nfortunate in his syllabic values, sixteen of which have been accepted as\r\nstrictly correct, if we include two where _w_ is substituted for the\r\nmore usual _m_; and eight others may be passed as approximately correct\r\n(Nos. 5, 11, 12, 22, 23, 60, 69, 81). The values he attached to about\r\nfifteen other signs were, however, highly inaccurate and misleading;\r\nand he was unable to assign any value whatever to twenty-two out of his\r\neighty-two signs.[628]\r\n\r\nHe could not identify the sign for _l_; no doubt because there was no\r\ncorresponding sound in the Persian by which he was guided, and he thought\r\nthat no syllable began with _m_. He considers all the syllables begin\r\nwith a consonant, though he detected two possible exceptions, where the\r\nsyllables appear to be _as_ (Nos. 8 and 82). Neither of these are in\r\nreality exceptions, but there are numerous other instances where the\r\nvowel is the initial. None of his syllables exceed two letters, though\r\nlater investigation has shown that there are several cases where a\r\nvowel separates two consonants. He noticed that the syllabic sign was\r\nfrequently replaced by two signs to express the simple consonant and\r\nthe vowel. He observed the peculiarity that the language knows of no\r\ndifference between the sounds of _m_ and _w_, both being written with the\r\nsame letter; and he also showed that the sonants are generally absent,\r\nfor while _k_, _p_, _t_ are represented, he could not find _g_, _b_, or\r\n_d_. He saw that the consonants are sometimes doubled in the middle of\r\na word; and he conjectured that this form was adopted to indicate the\r\ndistinction. Thus, he thought the syllabic sign for _pi_ might express\r\neither _pi_ or _bi_; but if preceded by the alphabetical sign for _p_,\r\nthe two together denoted the surd.\r\n\r\nAt a time when the affinities of the language were entirely unknown St.\r\nMartin had given it the name of Median, no doubt under the supposition\r\nthat it was allied to Persian and spoken by the Median branch of the\r\ncommon Aryan race.[629] The investigations now concluded by Westergaard\r\nshowed for the first time that its affinities were with the Scythic or\r\nTuranian family of languages, and the inconvenience of retaining the\r\nname of Median first became apparent.[630] There could be no doubt that\r\nthe Median conquerors were Aryans, as may be shown from the names of\r\ntheir leaders, and their close relationship to the Persians in race\r\nand language was accepted by all the early historians as self-evident.\r\nIt is clear, therefore, that the language of the second column is not\r\ntheirs, yet Westergaard determined to adhere to the name of Median\r\nas its most appropriate designation. He was led to adopt this course\r\nchiefly because there appeared to be no other district except Media\r\nwhere it could have been spoken, and also because its graphic system\r\nseems to indicate contact with Assyria. There can be little doubt that\r\nhis decision was fully justified at the time, and, to avoid unnecessary\r\nconfusion, in referring to the earlier writers we have in this chapter\r\ngenerally followed their description of the language of the second column\r\nas Median. On the other hand, modern discovery has tended to increase the\r\nimportance of Susa, by showing that at least a portion of its territory\r\nhad become the hereditary dominions of Cyrus, before his accession to\r\nthe Persian throne. At the same time the connection between the language\r\nof the second column and that of the ancient inscriptions found in the\r\ndistrict has been more completely recognised. There appears good ground\r\nto believe that the Aryan race had been established throughout Media\r\nlong before they rose into historical importance. The inconvenience\r\nof calling a Scythian language after the Aryan Medians has therefore\r\nmanifestly increased, while the name of ‘Susian,’ though not free from\r\nobjection, has become more appropriate, and is the one now generally\r\nadopted. How far the language was spoken beyond the limits of Susiana,\r\namong the subject tribes of Media, may still be open to conjecture. There\r\nis, as we shall see, some evidence in favour of its extension.\r\n\r\nIt will be recollected that early in 1846 Rawlinson had been able to\r\ntranslate the whole of the last paragraph of the second column of the\r\nBehistun inscription from the Median or Susian text, the Persian version\r\nof that passage having been found illegible.[631] Several years later\r\nMr. Norris, with all his special knowledge, was obliged to confess that\r\nhe was ‘unable to give a better translation than Colonel Rawlinson\r\nhas prepared’ of that very paragraph.[632] In the same year Rawlinson\r\nannounced the opinion his studies had led him to adopt upon this subject.\r\nIt does not appear that he was as yet acquainted with Westergaard’s\r\nessay; but he had arrived at the same conclusion with reference to the\r\nScythic affinities of the language. He likewise estimated the number\r\nof the signs at about a hundred, ‘the vowels, unless they commence a\r\nsyllable, being for the most part inherent.’ He does not appear to\r\nhave noticed the absence of sonants, but he saw that there must be\r\nconsiderable interchangeability in letters of the same class, and perhaps\r\neven between _n_ and _l_. He added that the language evinced a repugnance\r\nto _r_. He held that ‘it resembles the Scythic in the employment of\r\npost-positions and pronominal possessive suffixes.’ In the declension of\r\nnouns it uses post-fixed particles that are frequently the same as in\r\nmodern Turkish, and he notified the existence of a Tartarian gerund.\r\nThe pronouns are, he says, Semitic; the adverbs Aryan; the vocabulary a\r\nstrange agglomeration of Turkish and Semitic. Although its construction\r\nis more akin to Aryan than Scythic, yet upon the whole he decides that\r\nits affinity is with the Scythic, and suggests that that would be a\r\nmore appropriate name for it than Median.[633] He thought some of its\r\npeculiarities might be explained by comparison with the Georgian, which,\r\nwhen time permitted, he proposed to undertake.[634] He suggested that\r\nit was the language of the aboriginal race whom the Aryan Medes had\r\nconquered, and whose settlements reached at least to Behistun, where an\r\ninscription had been found without the Persian translation, apparently\r\nindicating that it was locally comprehensible.[635]\r\n\r\nWhen Rawlinson had finished his Persian Memoir he devoted himself to\r\na more elaborate study of the Median, and he appears to have nearly\r\ncompleted an essay upon the subject. Meanwhile, however, he was drawn\r\nfrom this branch of inquiry to the more attractive and useful study of\r\nthe Babylonian column: and his work on Median was never published.[636]\r\nHe did not, however, lose his interest in the subject. He handed over his\r\ncopies and other materials to Mr. Norris, who undertook the investigation\r\nof the subject and to whom he continued to give valuable assistance as\r\noccasion arose.\r\n\r\nThe study of Median was taken up in the meantime by Dr. Hincks from\r\nthe point where it was left by Westergaard and Rawlinson. Hincks’s\r\ncontribution is contained in three papers read before the Irish Academy\r\nbetween June 1846 and January 1847; and the last two appeared after he\r\nhad seen the opinions of Rawlinson to which we have referred.[637] These\r\npapers were communicated without delay to the Asiatic Society in London,\r\nas we learn from a note by the Secretary, who says he had just received\r\n(June 1846) a communication on the Median cuneiform from ‘a learned\r\nclergyman in a remote part of Ireland.’[638]\r\n\r\nHincks differed in some material points from Westergaard. He would not\r\nadmit the long vowels, and limited them to _a_, _i_ and _u_, adding,\r\nhowever, _er_ to their number. He restricted the simple consonants to\r\n_m_, _p_, _t_, _k_, _s_, and _n_; and from these he thought all the other\r\nsigns were combined. He rightly admitted the compound syllabic form,\r\nconsisting of two consonants joined by a vowel, which Westergaard had\r\noverlooked, and he even allows the occasional use of a double syllable,\r\nsuch as ‘ersa’ and ‘washa.’ He showed that the vowel is never omitted,\r\nthough not always necessarily pronounced. Thus the group ‘an-na-ap’\r\nreads simply ‘anap’; and he did not consider that the simple consonants\r\npreceding its syllabic form altered the sound as Westergaard had\r\nsuggested.[639] Hincks adopted the eighty-two signs distinguished by\r\nWestergaard, and attempted the identification of sixty-seven, or seven\r\nmore than Westergaard. His identification of the three vowels, _a_, _i_\r\nand _u_, was correct: and his limited number of consonants were also\r\ncorrect so far as they went, with the exception of _p_, which is the\r\nsyllable ‘pir’ (No. 40). He, however, allotted more than one sign to\r\nsome of his consonants: thus _k_ is represented by three signs, _t_ by\r\ntwo; and conversely he allowed that several characters might express the\r\nsame value. He accepted fifteen of Westergaard’s correct syllabic values\r\nand added nine of his own, to which we may add fifteen others nearly\r\ncorrect, or thirty-nine in all; thus, including his three vowels and\r\nfive consonants, he had forty-seven signs available for transliteration,\r\nas opposed to the twenty-nine of Westergaard. Singularly enough he made\r\nlittle improvement in the misleading syllabic signs of his predecessor.\r\nSome of them, indeed, he made considerably worse, and added others of his\r\nown, so that, notwithstanding a few corrections, their number rose to\r\nseventeen. He, however, pointed out that there was a determinative before\r\nthe words for ‘god,’ ‘Ormuzd’ and ‘heaven,’ contrary to the opinion of\r\nWestergaard; and that the group the latter had mistaken for the vowel a\r\nwas precisely that sign. He was less successful in his classification of\r\nthe language, which he could not accept as Scythic. He considered its\r\naffinity was with the Aryan family, but he could not find that any of the\r\nIndo-European languages had similar inflections.[640]\r\n\r\nA few years later De Saulcy wrote two articles in the ‘Journal Asiatique’\r\non the Median, without, however, making any important contribution to\r\nthe subject.[641] His papers deserve notice chiefly on account of his\r\neminence in other departments of study, and because he was the only\r\nContinental writer whose attention was directed at that time to this\r\nspecial branch of inquiry.[642] He thought he could recognise that it\r\nbore a close relationship to Persian, sufficient to justify the opinion\r\nof Strabo that the two languages were the same. Both Westergaard and\r\nRawlinson had already observed that some of its grammatical forms and\r\nvocabulary could be best explained by reference to the modern Georgian\r\nand Turkish; and De Saulcy, notwithstanding his opinion of its affinity\r\nwith Aryan, fully recognised that it had left traces in other quarters,\r\nincluding Kurd, Mongol, Armenian and the Gipsy tongue, but nowhere to a\r\ngreater degree than in Turkish. He supports his opinion with a wealth of\r\nillustration drawn from these sources that must have fairly distracted\r\nhis printer, and the indiscriminate use of the mechanism of philological\r\ndictionaries has in fact led the writer into many serious errors. He\r\ndoes not refer to Hincks, and notwithstanding all the resources at his\r\ncommand, he has fallen far short of the Irish writer whose country\r\nrectory was ill provided with these artificial appliances. De Saulcy\r\nhas not, in fact, added a single correct value to those already known,\r\nand has failed to recognise several already established as correct. The\r\nutmost generosity cannot concede to him the possession of more than\r\ntwenty-one correct values and nine nearly correct, all previously known;\r\nso that he had not more than thirty available for transliteration, as\r\nopposed to the twenty-nine of Westergaard and the forty-seven of Hincks.\r\nBut he introduced a host of errors that are wholly his own. He assigned\r\nno less that thirty values that are absolutely wrong, although he only\r\nattempted sixty-two out of the eighty-two in Westergaard’s list. But it\r\nis not only in the details of decipherment that he went astray; his error\r\ncovers the whole conception of the structure of the language. He has no\r\nless than fifteen different signs for vowels representing many fantastic\r\ngradations of sound. Different modifications of _a_ and _ou_ monopolise\r\neach three signs, besides the concession of one each for _hou_ and _ô_.\r\nA simple _u_ is not suffered to appear; but _ha_, _he_ or _e_?, _ya_,\r\n_aï_?, and _oui_ are classified among the vowels. Some difference still\r\nexists as to the treatment of the vowels. The latest authority limits\r\nthem to _a_, _e_, _i_ and _u_, and excludes _o_.[643] M. Oppert ranks\r\n_a_ or _ha_ among the consonants; and in addition to _e_, _i_ and _u_ he\r\nadmits _o_ and such sounds as _yi_, _ya_, _ah_ among vowels.[644]\r\n\r\nBut it is in the treatment of the consonants that De Saulcy has most\r\ndeparted from the earliest and the latest scholars. He fully admits\r\nthe syllabic character of the language, but he has done the utmost\r\nunder the circumstances to conceal this peculiarity.[645] In his list\r\nthe only sign that appears in syllabic form is the semi-vowel _ar_\r\nattributed to a defective sign (No. 10), and the eye already accustomed\r\nto the appearance of syllabic combinations is struck by the singular\r\nbareness produced by purely alphabetical letters. He admits altogether\r\ntwenty-one distinct consonantal sounds, of which fourteen are ‘quiescent’\r\nor simple consonants, and each is represented by one sign only, except\r\n_m_, _w_, to which three are allotted. He allows six gutturals to a\r\nlanguage that has at most but two, and fills the other classes with\r\nscarcely less profusion. He recognises that the signs for _m_ and _w_\r\nare interchangeable, and that _d_ and _t_, as well as _b_ and _p_, have\r\nseveral signs common to both; but he gives both _p_ and _t_ the exclusive\r\nuse of others; and _dè_ and _dh_ have each a sign reserved to themselves.\r\nHis consonantal sounds are given different signs according as they are\r\nsupposed to be followed by _a_, by _e_ or _i_, and by _o_ or _ou_, an\r\nidea no doubt suggested by the restricted use of the same principle in\r\nOld Persian. These letters may be said to be practically syllabic signs,\r\nas they are only used in conjunction with a vowel; but in reality the\r\nclassification involves serious error. It is now admitted that, with\r\nfew exceptions, the same sign never conveys the sound of more than one\r\nvowel, and in the isolated cases where it occurs it is generally at the\r\nend of a word. In the whole Syllabarium of Weisbach there is only one\r\ninstance where the same sign is given an optional sound of _pe_, _pat_,\r\nand in that of Oppert there are only three where _a_ can be exchanged\r\nfor _i_.[646] In neither authority is there a single instance where _e_\r\nand _i_ are interchangeable. It is therefore a fundamental error of the\r\ngravest character to represent the same sign as systematically employed\r\nto express either of two vowel sounds, even if the two selected were\r\never interchangeable. It is, moreover, doubtful whether there was any\r\ndifference allowed between the sounds of _o_ and _u_, except in the\r\nattempt to express foreign words. De Saulcy’s system also excluded the\r\ncompound syllables when two consonants are divided by a vowel. While\r\nHincks did good service in adding a third determinative to the two\r\nacknowledged by Westergaard, De Saulcy actually refused to admit the\r\ndeterminative character of the horizontal wedge, and thereby reduced the\r\nnumber to one. On the other hand, he thought he had detected a sign to\r\nindicate the plural, which is in fact nothing but the syllable _sin_.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most useful contribution he made was the remark that, while a\r\nfew of the Median signs bore a certain resemblance to those of the same\r\nvalue in Persian, the larger number of them were actually ‘identical’\r\nwith the Assyrian.[647] It must be confessed that it was long before\r\nthis identity was detected, and even such a practised copyist as\r\nWestergaard declared that the five different species of cuneiform writing\r\nthen known ‘differed from one another in the shape of nearly every letter\r\nor group,’[648] and considerable practice is still required before their\r\nidentity can be brought home to the eye. The similarity—to employ a less\r\nemphatic expression—proved, however, of great assistance in enabling\r\nfuture inquirers to fix the value of the signs. Some time had yet to\r\nelapse before they could take advantage of this discovery, for when De\r\nSaulcy wrote, the Assyrian characters were themselves still undeciphered.\r\n\r\nDe Saulcy’s work was criticised by Löwenstern in the ‘Revue\r\nArchéologique’ (1850), where he sought to trace the affinity of Median\r\nto the Aramaic branch of the Semitic family, while he admitted that some\r\nof the endings might be traced in Pehlevi and New Persian. He did not\r\nconsider it to be the Median language, which, he maintained, is properly\r\nrepresented by Zend; and he suggested, as Mr. Rich had done before, that\r\nit might have been the dialect of Susa.[649] Holtzmann fully recognised\r\nthat it contained Semitic elements, but still he considered that it\r\nshould be regarded as the mother of Pehlevi; and he subsequently added\r\nthat it was probably the language of the court at Susa.[650] Still\r\nthe opinion of its Scythic origin, first suggested by Westergaard\r\nand Rawlinson, continued to gain ground, supported, no doubt, by the\r\nnumerous similarities to this linguistic stock that were pointed out in\r\nthe learned Memoirs of De Saulcy. In 1852, M. Oppert, writing on the\r\nPersian column, went so far as to propose to drop the designation Median\r\naltogether, and, following the suggestion of Rawlinson, to substitute\r\n‘Scythic.’ At that time he considered it to be the language of the hordes\r\nwho overran Western Asia, and who, after twenty-eight years of domination\r\nin Media, were finally expelled by Cyaxares. It must be admitted\r\nthat they were fortunate to leave such a permanent memorial of their\r\npassage.[651]\r\n\r\nA more important contribution than any of these was made by Luzzato, who\r\nshowed with sufficient clearness that twenty-four of the Median signs\r\ncorresponded to the Babylonian (1850).\r\n\r\nDown to the time we have now reached the progress made was disappointing.\r\nWe have seen that much speculation was indulged as to the affinity of\r\nthe language and the people to whom it should properly be attributed;\r\nbut very little knowledge of the language itself had been acquired.\r\nDr. Hincks had read forty-eight signs with sufficient correctness, and\r\nDe Saulcy thirty-one, out of the one hundred and eleven with which the\r\nlanguage is written; but both scholars were encumbered by the multitude\r\nof unknown or erroneous values. In 1852, however, a considerable step\r\nwas made in advance. On July 3 of that year, Mr. Norris read a paper\r\nto the Asiatic Society on the result of his study of the Median column\r\nof the Behistun inscription with which Colonel Rawlinson had entrusted\r\nhim; but the essay did not appear in the Journal in its completed\r\nform till 1855. The much greater diversity of material at his command\r\nenabled him to dispose of many difficulties that had obstructed earlier\r\nscholars. In the first place, he was able to increase the number of signs\r\nfrom the eighty-two that had puzzled his predecessors to one hundred\r\nand three, and to all of these he endeavoured to assign values. He was\r\nsuccessful with fifty-seven, and twenty-one others were sufficiently\r\ncorrect for purposes of transliteration, making a total of seventy-eight\r\nin addition to two determinatives. One other sign has not even yet been\r\nsatisfactorily settled,[652] and he still had twenty-four incorrect\r\nvalues. Unlike many decipherers, however, he was able to distinguish\r\nthe gradations of certainty attaching to the values he assigned. Those\r\nthat appear in his list allied to any vowel other than _a_, _i_ or _u_\r\nare to be regarded as questionable. He estimated their number with\r\ntolerable accuracy at about twenty. He fully recognised the true syllabic\r\ncharacter of the language. ‘Each character,’ he says, ‘represents a\r\nsyllable which may be either a single vowel or a consonant and vowel, or\r\ntwo consonants with a vowel between them.’[653] He has, however, given\r\nsix signs in his list a purely consonantal value, _m_, _r_, _s_ and _t_,\r\nthe two latter being each represented by two signs.[654] Four of these\r\nare correct, but the second signs for s and t are both wrong. He limited\r\nthe vowels to _a_, _i_ and _u_, but he has also allowed _e_ to appear in\r\nhis list, because he found a sign in Median that corresponds exactly to\r\nthe Babylonian for that letter, and it is now admitted as correct. He\r\nreckoned eleven initial consonantal sounds: they include the consonants\r\nalready named with the exception of _m_, together with _th_, _ch_, _p_,\r\n_k_, _v_, _l_, _n_ and _y_. With these united to one of the three vowels\r\nall the syllables in the language are formed. The double syllables\r\nare composed of the same consonantal sounds (excluding _th_ and _y_),\r\nseparated by _a_. He did not consider that any of the signs represented\r\nthe union of two consonants separated by _i_ or _u_, an opinion that has\r\nbeen since over-ruled. He recognised that there was no difference between\r\nthe surd and sonant consonants at the beginning of a word, and he agreed\r\nwith Westergaard that the double letter in the middle emphasised the hard\r\nsound. He saw also that the same sign was used equally to express the\r\nPersian _m_ and _w_; and that ‘the aspirate, which is quite uncertain,\r\nmust also be disregarded.’ He accepted the two determinative signs\r\nalready admitted by Westergaard, and also the determinative before the\r\nwords for ‘god’ and ‘heaven’ which had been pointed out by Hincks.[655]\r\nHe also recognised the ideogram for ‘month.’ The gradual recognition of\r\nthe similarity of a large number of the Median and Babylonian signs was\r\nat length beginning to bear fruit. Norris indicates a resemblance between\r\nnearly fifty in his list of one hundred and three signs.[656] Twenty\r\nof these are indeed ‘identical’ in form, and independent investigation\r\nproved that they conveyed the same sound in both languages. In the\r\nothers the similarity was sufficiently striking to afford an important\r\nconfirmation of the values arrived at by the study of the text. Indeed\r\nin a few cases—such, for example, as the _e_ already mentioned, the\r\nsimilarity to the form of a Babylonian character was the only clue to\r\nthe value of the Median sign.[657] If he had allowed himself to be more\r\ninfluenced by the Babylonian script he would have slightly increased\r\nthe number of his correct values;[658] though, on the other hand, a too\r\nrigorous adherence to this rule might have landed him in some errors. He\r\nhazarded the important statement, subsequently so remarkably confirmed,\r\nthat there are evident signs that the syllabarium had been originally\r\ndevised to express a Scythic tongue,[659] for, he said, ‘the unchangeable\r\nroots, the agglutinative structure and the simple syllabisation of such\r\ntongues are perfectly suited to such a mode of writing, while the Semitic\r\nand Indo-Germanic cannot without the most awkward and unsystematic\r\narrangements be represented by it.’ He considered that the language of\r\nthe second column must have been that of the pastoral tribes of Persia;\r\nand he pointed out that the omission from the Median text of the names\r\nof the districts in which Otiara and Rhages are placed showed that those\r\ntowns were well known where the language was spoken, and it also afforded\r\nsome evidence of the area it covered. On the other hand, the discovery\r\nof Scythic inscriptions at Susa seemed to point no less emphatically to\r\nits southern range, and the possibility presented itself that that was\r\nthe source from which it spread. De Saulcy farther showed that a close\r\nanalogy might be traced to Turkish; but Norris was the first to point out\r\nthat its nearest modern relationship is with the Volga-Finnish branch\r\nof the Scythic family, and that it bears a close resemblance to the\r\nlanguage now spoken by the Finns.[660]\r\n\r\nHe was the first to treat the grammar systematically. He pointed out\r\nwith sufficient accuracy the case-endings of nouns,[661] and explained\r\nthat, in common with Finnish, they distinguished more cases than the\r\nIndo-European languages, such as the allative and the locative. He showed\r\nthat there was no distinction of gender, and that the adjectives had the\r\nsame case-endings as the nouns. He explained that the plural was formed\r\nby the addition of _pa_ (which, however, ought to have been _p_, _pe_, or\r\n_ip_), and that the case-ending was suffixed to it. He distinguished the\r\npronouns with tolerable correctness, and showed their relationship to the\r\nTartar languages. He also proved that the analogies with these languages\r\nare more obvious in the verb than in the other parts of speech.\r\n\r\nHe has given an admirable transcript of the Median text of the Behistun\r\ninscription in eight plates, accompanied by a transliteration that shows\r\na remarkable improvement on all previous efforts, though of course it\r\nhas since undergone considerable alteration. His translation follows\r\nthe rendering of the Persian column made by Rawlinson, and has received\r\nlittle alteration from later scholars. He brought his essay to a close\r\nby giving the Median transliteration and translation of the remaining\r\ninscriptions, including two that were lately found by Mr. Loftus at Susa,\r\nand which now appear for the first time. The unilingual at Persepolis\r\nwas at length intelligibly rendered. Westergaard had made out its\r\ngeneral purport; but even this imperfect result escaped the efforts of\r\nDe Saulcy.[662] The last paragraph was, however, found one of unusual\r\ndifficulty, and Norris suggested two alternative versions:\r\n\r\n  1. ‘Ormuzd, protect me, with all the gods, and also this\r\n  fortress. Moreover, do not doubt that those confined in this\r\n  place are wicked men;’\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n  2. ‘Ormuzd, protect me, with all the gods, and also this fortress\r\n  and what is enclosed therein. This do not doubt that the wicked\r\n  men will be punished.’\r\n\r\nIn 1879, Oppert reads the same passage:\r\n\r\n  ‘Que me protège Ormazd avec tous les Dieux, et cette forteresse,\r\n  et aussi ce qui est dans cette forteresse. Que jamais je ne voie\r\n  ce que l’homme méchant souhaite [que je voie]!’\r\n\r\nThe latest attempt was made by Weisbach, in 1890, and runs thus:\r\n\r\n  ‘Mich möge Ahuramazda mit allen Göttern schützen, und diese\r\n  Festung, und wiederum zu diesem Platze...! Das möge er nicht\r\n  sehen (?), das, was der feindliche Mann ersinnt!’[663]\r\n\r\nThe work of Norris excited some controversy, and Holtzmann was especially\r\nconcerned to refute the Finnic-Tartar hypothesis. M. Haug revived the\r\ntheory of its closer relationship to Turkish, proposed by De Saulcy, and\r\nhe suggested that the Persians themselves were originally Tartars.[664]\r\n\r\nM. Oppert had now become the chief representative of cuneiform studies\r\nupon the Continent. His essays on the Persian column of the inscriptions\r\n(1851-2), evinced a complete mastery of the subject and considerable\r\nindependence in the treatment of doubtful passages. The reputation\r\nhe had earned led to his being attached to the French scientific\r\nexpedition to Babylonia. On his return he undertook to write an account\r\nof the expedition, and his second volume, which made its appearance in\r\n1859, contains an elaborate account of the work of decipherment.[665]\r\nAlthough the book is chiefly concerned with Assyrian, he has given a\r\nSyllabarium of the Median, with the object chiefly of comparing it with\r\nthe Babylonian and Assyrian systems of writing.[666] The great importance\r\nresulting from such a comparison now becomes apparent. The values of the\r\nAssyrian signs were already ascertained in a large number of cases, and\r\nit was recognised that, with some exceptions, the similar sign in Median\r\ngenerally expressed the same value. The principle was also definitely\r\nadmitted that each sign has only one value,[667] and that an independent\r\nsign may be looked for to express the combination of the vowels _a_,\r\n_i_ and _u_ before and after each of the principal consonants, _k_,\r\n_p_, _t_, _m_, _r_, _l_ and _s_, and therefore we may expect a sign for\r\neach of such forms as _ka_, _ki_, _ku_, _ak_, _ik_, _uk_, and so on.\r\nThe application of this system enabled Oppert to make a very decisive\r\nimprovement in the Syllabarium. It will be recollected that Norris had\r\ntwenty-four wrong values, and twenty-one only approximately correct.\r\nOppert now corrects twelve of the former and eighteen of the latter. The\r\nresult was that he could dispose of eighty-three values absolutely and\r\nsix nearly correct. He was doubtful as to the sound of one, wrong as to\r\nseven, and he omitted seven. Thus, when the determinatives are added,\r\nall of the 106 signs in Menant’s list were deciphered except fifteen. He\r\nalso added a fourth to the list of determinative signs. He showed that\r\nthe one mistaken by Norris for _s_ was in fact used simply to indicate\r\nthat the following letter was an ideogram (No. 66 of Hincks). It had long\r\nago been observed that a single sign was employed for ‘king,’ and Norris\r\nadded another for ‘month.’ Oppert points out that the determinative\r\nbefore ‘god’ was also an ideogram for ‘god,’ and that ‘man,’ ‘water,’\r\n‘animal,’ or ‘horse’ and ‘road’ were likewise indicated by ideographic\r\nsigns. He considered that the grammatical forms show analogy first to\r\nMagyar, then to Turkish, Mongol and Finnish. He gave it the name of\r\nMedo-Scythic, and he now considered that it was spoken by the tribes at\r\nPersepolis and Behistun—more particularly by those in the north of Media.\r\nThe student of the second column had at his command some ninety-nine\r\nproper names, besides a large number of Persian official terms and titles\r\ntransliterated into the Median script; and with their assistance the\r\npronunciation of about a hundred and forty words was already known.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable success of Oppert was due almost entirely to the\r\nsuccessful comparison of the Median and Babylonian signs; and it had\r\nsomething of an accidental character, for it appeared in a work chiefly\r\ndevoted to Assyrian and without special reference to this particular\r\nbranch of the subject. Indeed the attention of scholars was now so\r\nthoroughly absorbed by the study of Assyrian and the many new discoveries\r\nit opened to their view, that the second column fell into comparative\r\nneglect. Mordtmann wrote papers upon it in 1862, and again in 1870, in\r\nthe ‘German Oriental Gazette,’ in which he appears to have ignored the\r\nresults already attained, and to have given different values to some of\r\nthe signs. He called the language Susian, in consequence of the order\r\nin which the provinces of ‘Persia, Susiana and Babylon’ occur in the\r\nBehistun inscription, and also because Susa bears an entirely different\r\nname in the Median from that given to it in the Persian, while the other\r\nnames are alike in both. In support of his opinion he was the first to\r\nshow that the inscriptions on some bricks found at Susa, which were then\r\nbeginning to attract attention, though written in a different dialect,\r\nwere evidently similar in speech and writing to the second column.\r\n\r\nIt will be recollected that Rawlinson visited Susa in 1836, and observed\r\na few bricks and a broken obelisk bearing the peculiar inscriptions\r\nto which we have just referred. He considered the style of writing to\r\nbe ‘the farthest removed of any from the original Assyrian type,’ and\r\nhe surmised that the language is ‘not even, I think, of the Semitic\r\nfamily.’[668] In 1852, Loftus collected a few other inscriptions in\r\nthe same character and language, which were sent to Rawlinson. Mr.\r\nNorris, who announced this acquisition in his Median Memoir, stated\r\nthat Rawlinson still thought that the characters were those of ‘the\r\nAssyrian alphabet,’ but in a different language, and that he had made out\r\nsufficient to show that they belonged to Susian kings who were anterior\r\nto Darius.[669]\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Layard visited the same neighbourhood, in 1841, he was fortunate\r\nenough to be able to copy two inscriptions at Malamir, one of thirty-six\r\nlines and the other of twenty-four.[670] Rawlinson, in his classification\r\nof the cuneiform inscriptions, called them the Elymaean, and from the\r\ndifferences they presented, he considered that they ‘are entitled to an\r\nindependent place,’ apart from Babylonian or Assyrian. In 1850, he again\r\npoints out their dissimilarity from either of the two last mentioned, but\r\nhe adds that they are not so difficult to read as those he had found on\r\nthe bricks at Susa.[671] The surprising discovery of De Saulcy that the\r\nMedian and Babylonian characters are ‘identical,’ notwithstanding their\r\napparent diversity, naturally stimulated the ingenuity of other writers\r\nto widen the sphere of the ‘identical’; and Mordtmann was among the first\r\nwho laboured in this direction. The work was continued by Lenormant, who\r\nmade his appearance within the circle of cuneiform scholars in 1871, by\r\nthe publication of his first series of ‘Lettres Assyriennes,’ followed,\r\nin 1873, by the ‘Choix de Textes.’ The result of the minute comparison he\r\ninstituted was to show that the Old Susian script closely resembled Old\r\nBabylonian, while the Elymaean of Malamir is simply an earlier form of\r\nthe Median or New Susian character. The development towards ‘identity’\r\nhad now gone so far that Bertin describes the difference between Old\r\nSusian and Old Babylonian as very slight, while Elymaean and Median are\r\nsimple ‘variants of the same.’[672]\r\n\r\nMordtmann and Lenormant were successful also in showing that both these\r\ntwo newly-discovered languages, or dialects, are closely related to\r\nMedian, and belonged therefore to the Scythic family. The remarkable\r\ndiscovery that had recently been made that a Scythic language—the\r\nAkkadian—was the primitive speech of Chaldæa, gave a very unexpected\r\nextension to the range of the Turanian races; and it was now beginning to\r\nbe recognised that the civilisation of Western Asia is to be referred to\r\nthem, and not, as heretofore supposed, to a Semitic people. The effect\r\nof these discoveries was to stimulate once more the flagging interest\r\nin the writing of the second column, and efforts were now directed to\r\ndetermine the nature of its relationship to the newly-found dialects,\r\nand more particularly to ascertain the people to whom each might be\r\nattributed. The first to enter upon this new field of inquiry after\r\nLenormant was Oppert, who submitted a tentative translation of an Old\r\nSusian inscription to the Congress of Orientalists in 1873. In the\r\nfollowing year, Mr. Sayce attempted two short inscriptions published by\r\nLenormant. If we may judge by comparison with a later version given by\r\nOppert, no great measure of success was yet attained.[673] Indeed three\r\nyears afterwards, Oppert himself admitted that the Susian could not yet\r\nbe read. The inscriptions of Malamir caused less difficulty, and Sayce\r\ndeclared that it was ‘the same as the Median with a few unimportant\r\nvariations.’ It must be confessed, however, that his subsequent analysis\r\ntended to show that these ‘variations’ had a considerable range both in\r\ngrammar and vocabulary.[674]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the language of the second column continued to receive a\r\ngreat variety of names which has produced immense confusion. Lenormant,\r\nhowever, heroically adheres to ‘Median,’ because one of the Median tribes\r\nis specially distinguished as Aryan, and it was therefore reasonable to\r\nsuppose that the mass of the people were of different, and presumably\r\nof Turanian, race. Professor Sayce admits that it must have been ‘the\r\nvernacular of the lower classes of Persia: in other words, of the Medes’;\r\nbut he preferred to call it Elamite, ‘as less likely to lead to ambiguity\r\nand misconception.’ He suggests that Amardian would be still better,\r\nfor Susiana is always called ‘Khapirti’ in the Median text; and this is\r\nevidently the same as the country of the Amardians of Strabo. He showed\r\nthat its relation to the dialect of Malamir was closer than to that of\r\nOld Susian; and he thought there was no doubt that the latter was related\r\nto the Akkadian.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting parts of Professor Sayce’s essay was the\r\npublication of ‘a revised list of the powers of the Elamite’ (_i.e._\r\nSusian) ‘character, which can now be determined by means of the Assyrian\r\nsyllabary.’[675] Written in 1874, this document illustrates the process\r\nof development that occurred between the two works of Oppert, that of\r\n1859 and the one of 1879, to be mentioned shortly. It will be recollected\r\nthat we left him with seven wrong values, six nearly correct and seven\r\nomitted altogether. We find that when Sayce wrote, four of the first and\r\none of the second had been corrected, and three signs omitted by Oppert\r\nwere now provided with correct, or nearly correct, values. At the same\r\ntime a plentiful crop of fresh errors was introduced. Six or seven\r\nvalues, correctly ascertained in 1859, were now rejected and erroneous\r\nones substituted. At least three of the values proposed for the signs\r\nomitted by Oppert were very far indeed from the mark. The ideogram for\r\n‘horse’ was rejected in favour of the syllable _az_, which may have\r\nsuggested to Weisbach the substitution of ‘donkey’ in place of the nobler\r\nquadruped preferred by Oppert.\r\n\r\nThe two writers who have brought the knowledge of the Median syllabary\r\nto its present standard are Oppert and Weisbach: the former in a special\r\ntreatise written in 1879 (‘Le Peuple des Mèdes’) long remained the\r\nleading authority on the subject, and his conclusions have in the main\r\nderived confirmation from the more recent investigations of Weisbach on\r\nthe language of the second column, which appeared in 1890. With very\r\nfew exceptions, to be noticed later, both scholars are in substantial\r\nagreement as to the values of the signs; and it is this agreement\r\nthat forms for the present the standard of right and wrong, by which\r\nthe efforts of their predecessors have been judged. Both writers were\r\nguided to a large extent by the values of the corresponding Babylonian\r\ncharacters.[676] Oppert, as was said, thought he could trace a\r\nresemblance between ninety-six of the Median signs and their Babylonian\r\nequivalents. In each case, the sound as well as the form of the character\r\nwas appropriated. Weisbach is much less struck by the general application\r\nof this law. He fully admits the strong similarity of many of the signs,\r\nbut some have, he says, so far diverged from their original types as\r\nto be hardly recognisable. Others, he thinks, were borrowed from New\r\nAssyrian, and a few from older forms. Indeed he is, on the whole,\r\nindisposed to derive the syllabary direct from the New Babylonian. He\r\nthinks it is more properly to be traced through the writing of Malamir\r\nto the Old Susian, and the development from the Old Babylonian of the\r\nlatter was a parallel and independent process similar to that which\r\nproduced the New Babylonian. But as the Old Susian character has not yet\r\nbeen sufficiently investigated, he restricts his comparison to the New\r\nBabylonian, and he points out some of the principles that were followed\r\nin the evolution of the new script. For example, the vertical wedge that\r\ncrosses the horizontal in the Babylonian is generally placed before them\r\nin Median, and the same rule applies to the horizontal crossing the\r\nvertical. There is an evident effort to simplify both the writing and the\r\nlanguage. The signs preserve the same signification in both, but when\r\nit happens in Babylonian that the same sign has many different values\r\n(sometimes no less than nine) it has never more than two in Median. So\r\nalso the number of homophones, or different signs with the same values,\r\nare strictly limited. Indeed, he considers that the Median was an early\r\neffort to approach an alphabetical system.[677]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that several of the errors made by Oppert in his list\r\nof 1859 were corrected from various sources before 1874.[678] He was\r\nstill left with three wrong values, five only nearly correct and four\r\nomitted altogether. Of the first class he now gives one a value that\r\naccords with that of Weisbach—11ᵇ, ‘ko’ for ‘kam,’ the ‘gau’ of Norris\r\nand Weisbach.[679] Of the second class he corrects four,[680] and he\r\nsupplies correct values to three of those previously omitted.[681]\r\n\r\nHe now presents us with a list of a hundred and twelve distinct signs,\r\nand no less than fifteen ideographs; but when their syllabic values are\r\nalso known the majority are included in the hundred and twelve signs.\r\nFour, however, appear among the ideographs for the first time, and\r\nraise the total number of signs to a hundred and sixteen. Six of these\r\nare,[682] however, repeated twice over to express different syllabic\r\nvalues, thus reducing the number of distinct signs to a hundred and ten.\r\nHe accepts a hundred and five of the hundred and six signs that were\r\nalready known, rejecting only one (No. 21). He completes his number by\r\nthe addition of five other signs,[683] of which Weisbach has accepted\r\nthree. With these two exceptions, the whole of Oppert’s signs are to\r\nbe found in Weisbach: that is, a hundred and eight out of the hundred\r\nand ten. Weisbach, however, includes in his list the No. 21 of Hincks,\r\nomitted by Oppert.\r\n\r\nThe two writers are also substantially agreed as to the values of the\r\nsigns. Of the hundred and six given in Menant’s list, we find they\r\ndiffer only as to seven. Of these, two are omitted by Oppert[684] and\r\none by Weisbach.[685] In four cases only have they arrived at absolutely\r\ncontradictory values.[686]\r\n\r\nThe discovery announced in 1859 of a determinative sign to indicate\r\nthat the one preceding it should be read ideographically led to the\r\nidentification of a number of signs to which ideographic values may be\r\nattached, and their number is raised from the seven known in 1859 to\r\nsixteen. The ones now added by Oppert are ‘town,’ ‘mountain,’ ‘race,’\r\n‘arch’ (a window), ‘sea,’ ‘house,’ ‘head,’ ‘ship,’ ‘camel’; and Weisbach\r\nhas since contributed a fifth determinative which, he says, is placed\r\nbefore articles of wood.[687]\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of the transliteration is greatly enhanced by the fact\r\nthat the same sign represents both _m_ and _w_, and the three gradations\r\nof sound—the surd, aspirate and sonant—are not distinguished by separate\r\nsigns. It is therefore impossible to say in many cases whether to\r\ntranscribe _m_ or _w_, _k_ or _g_, _p_ or _b_, _f_ or _d_; and Oppert\r\nhas enumerated no less than six different modifications of sounds—_č_\r\n(_tch_), _ḡ_ (_dj_), _z̆_, _ts_, _dz_, and _z_—that are all represented\r\nby a single sign.[688] Weisbach points out that _g_, is only clearly\r\ndistinguished from _k_ when it occurs before _i_. The Median _z_\r\nrepresents the Persian _z_, _c_, _j_, and the Babylonian _s_ (and _o_?);\r\nthe _r_ and _n_ are sometimes found to be interchangeable. When the sound\r\ncannot be checked by its occurrence in a proper name, Oppert generally\r\nadopts the hard sound; but he allows himself a certain latitude in the\r\napplication of this rule, and he shows a decisive preference of _w_ to\r\n_m_. Weisbach follows the uniform practice of transcribing the gutturals,\r\ndentals and labials by the tenues; he always uses _z_ for the Persian\r\n_c_, _j_ and _z_, and for the Babylonian _z_ and _s_; and, contrary to\r\nOppert, he prefers _m_ to _w_.\r\n\r\nOppert recognises the five vowels _a_, _e_, _i_, _o_ and _u_; and,\r\nfollowing De Saulcy, he admits _yi_, _ya_ and _ah_ in his list, among\r\nvowels. Weisbach excludes the _o_, for he considers there was no\r\ndifference of sound between it and _u_; the _y_ he includes among the\r\nsemi-vowels, with both _r_ and _l_. Although Oppert found that all\r\nthe five vowels follow the consonant to form the single syllable, he\r\nconsidered that only _a_, _i_ and _u_ precede it. Both writers agree to\r\nlimit the consonantal sounds to about eleven. Oppert was the first to\r\ntreat the grammar with elaborate care, and when he claimed that his work\r\nwas ‘une création entièrement nouvelle,’ the statement was probably more\r\nstrictly accurate than he imagined.\r\n\r\nThe nouns do not admit of any distinction of gender, and have only the\r\nsingular and plural number. Oppert distinguishes no fewer than twelve\r\ndifferent cases, indicated by suffixes, a profusion limited by Weisbach\r\nto eight, viz. nominative, genitive, accusative, dative, ablative,\r\nallative, locative and comitative.\r\n\r\nOppert, however, did good service in unravelling the mysteries of the\r\nverb, though his passion for systematising and ‘restoration’ has carried\r\nhim too far; and his verb, declined through all its moods and tenses,\r\npresents a very different appearance from the skeleton which, according\r\nto Weisbach, is all that can be strictly collected from the texts\r\nthemselves. For example, we are presented with the six persons of a\r\ncomplete past tense, where Weisbach can only find authority for three;\r\nand we get a complete imperfect, although only one termination is really\r\nknown, viz. that of the first person singular. With no less confidence we\r\nfind two verbs—a reciprocative (‘je me sus’), and an ‘intensive’ (‘savoir\r\nbien’)—of which Weisbach can see no trace; and the same remark may be\r\napplied to his desiderative (‘je veux savoir’) and his factitive (‘je\r\nfais savoir’).[689]\r\n\r\nBoth writers agree as to the personal pronouns; but in the possessive\r\nWeisbach can only find the third person singular and the first person\r\nplural, while Oppert supplies us with the series complete.[690]\r\n\r\nWeisbach calls attention to the dialectical differences in the\r\nNaksh-i-Rustam inscriptions, and to the evidence of decay visible in the\r\nlanguage of Artaxerxes at Susa.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons already mentioned there is considerable diversity\r\nobservable in the transliterations made by the two writers, but so far\r\nas we have observed they are in substantial agreement with regard to the\r\nmeaning of the text, as may be seen by a comparison of their rendering of\r\nthe unilingual inscription.[691] Occasionally, however, Weisbach finds\r\nhimself unable to follow the more imaginative flights of his predecessor.\r\nHe will have nothing to do with the ‘restoration’ of the concluding\r\nparagraph of the Suez inscription of Darius.[692] He is equally unable\r\nto accept the interesting completion of the detached inscription at\r\nBehistun, marked L by Norris. Norris reads: ‘I made another tablet in\r\nthe Arian language, such as did not exist before, and I made a large ...\r\nand a large ... and ... and....’ This not very promising attempt is\r\nperfected by Oppert as follows: ‘I have made also elsewhere a book in\r\nArian language, that formerly did not exist, and I have made the text\r\nof the Divine Law (Avesta) and a commentary of the Divine Law and the\r\nprayer and the translation.’ He observes truly that ‘the passage is of\r\nfirst-rate importance,’ and he adds encouragingly: ‘The explanation which\r\nI give is sure.’ It is therefore somewhat disconcerting to find that the\r\nlatest writer cannot get much beyond the crudity of Norris. Weisbach\r\nreads: ‘Machte ich Inschriften in anderer Weise (?) (nämlich) auf Arisch,\r\nwas vormals nicht war, und das grosse ... und das grosse ... und das ...\r\nund das ... machte ich.’ Alas for the Divine Law and the commentary and\r\nthe prayers![693]\r\n\r\nWe have already said that in 1859 Oppert had abandoned the hypothesis\r\nthat the language of the second column was introduced by the Scythic\r\nhordes who were expelled by Cyaxares. He recognised that it was\r\nconnected with the ancient Akkadian, and could not, therefore, be a\r\nnew importation, but an original native dialect. He considered that\r\nthe Median name itself is Turanian and related to ‘Mada,’ the Akkadian\r\nfor ‘land.’ He thought it is clear from Herodotus that the six tribes\r\nwho composed the Median nation were not all of the same origin. The\r\ndominant caste were, he still held, of the same Indo-European race as\r\nthe Persians, but a large part of the population were Turanians, and the\r\nlanguage of the second column was that of the agricultural and nomadic\r\ntribes of Media, especially those of the north. He accordingly gave it\r\nthe name of Medo-Scythic to distinguish it from the Aryan Median of the\r\nclassical writers.\r\n\r\nThis very tenable hypothesis he, however, abandoned in its turn, and\r\nadvanced one much more hazardous. He relies upon a fable of Herodotus\r\nto show that the Aryans occupied the country from a much earlier period\r\nthan has been commonly supposed, and did not, therefore, make their\r\nfirst appearance with Dejoces. Both Aryans and Turanians, he now thinks,\r\nwere long settled together in the same country, and it is impossible to\r\nsay which of the two were the first comers, though he inclines to give\r\nprecedence to the Aryans. The various tribes were upon an equality,\r\nsometimes the Turanian and sometimes the Aryan gaining the ascendency. He\r\nconsiders the former were known as the Medes, a word essentially Turanian\r\nin its origin, while the others retained their proper designation of\r\nAryans. He holds that the Median dynasty of Dejoces was Turanian. He\r\ncarefully analyses the names of their kings, and he has succeeded in\r\naffording a fresh illustration of the peculiar power of philology to\r\nprove any thesis whatever, when employed by a skilful manipulator. Not\r\nmany years before, he laid it down as self-evident that these same names\r\nwere pure Aryan.[694] Now it becomes no less apparent that they are pure\r\nTuranian. The dynasty of Dejoces marks the ascendency of the Turanian\r\nMedes, and the language of the second column is that which was spoken\r\nby them. He accordingly drops his previous qualification of Scythic,\r\nand gives it simply the name of Median. The rise of the Persian power\r\nenabled the Aryan Medes to recover the position they had temporarily\r\nlost, and hence all the names that occur from the time of Darius clearly\r\nbelong to that race. Mada became a geographical name which embraced\r\nthe whole population of the country now under an Aryan aristocracy,\r\nand Herodotus was therefore fully justified in speaking of the Medes\r\nand Persians as one in speech and descent. The theory of the Turanian\r\norigin of the Median dynasty has been almost universally abandoned.[695]\r\nThe attack upon it was led by the Jesuit scholar Delattre,[696] and\r\nthe whole controversy has been ably summarised by Weisbach. Recent\r\nwriters have thought it so necessary to insist upon the Aryan race of\r\nthe Median kings that they decline to give to the Turanian language\r\nof the second column the name of Median. It has accordingly come into\r\nfashion to indicate in an unmistakeable manner the source from which\r\nit has sprung. Delattre called it ‘Anzanisch,’ from the name of the\r\nterritory ruled by the Malamir kings. Halévy adopted a suggestion made\r\nby Mr. Sayce, and calls it ‘Amardian.’[697] Hommel speaks of it as\r\n‘Susian-Median’ and ‘Susian,’[698] a term which Weisbach has qualified by\r\ncalling it New Susian. The more probable opinion seems to be that it was\r\nthe language of Susa at the time of the Persian conquest, and possibly\r\nalso of some of the subjugated tribes in Media. The name of Susian is\r\ntherefore more appropriate than one that might confuse the people who\r\nspoke it with the Aryan conquerors of their country. Still it is very\r\nfar from satisfactory. The great importance of the inscriptions recently\r\ndiscovered in the Old Susian language will tend more and more to reserve\r\nto them the designation of Susian; and considerable confusion will arise\r\nfrom its extension also to the language of the second column. The latter\r\nmay possibly be a descendant of the true Susian, but both in the system\r\nof writing and in the language the connection is remote.\r\n\r\nThe relationship of the Median is now placed almost beyond the sphere\r\nof controversy. M. Gobineau, who wrote in 1859, maintained indeed that\r\nit was connected with Pehlevi, half Semitic and half Aryan: and M. Mohl\r\nstill earnestly hoped that we might ‘get rid of the Scythic hypothesis\r\nand all the complications it involves.’[699] But this desire was not\r\ndestined to be realised, and its affinity to the Altaic branch of the\r\nTuranian family is now admitted. Some doubt is felt as to whether it\r\nhas left any successor, and which of the modern languages approaches\r\nthe nearest. Oppert inclines to Turkish:[700] Weisbach is more guarded,\r\nand considers that it exhibits marked differences from all the living\r\nrepresentatives of its Turanian relatives.[701]\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that it and kindred languages were extensively\r\nspoken in early times throughout Susiana and the lower valley of\r\nthe Euphrates down to the Persian Gulf. Its connection with the Old\r\nSusian has never been doubted. Lenormant, Oppert, Sayce and Hommel\r\nhave testified to its more distant relationship with the Akkadian, the\r\nprimitive language of Babylonia. Weisbach is naturally more sceptical,\r\nfor in 1890 he had scarcely emancipated himself from the heresy\r\nof Halévy, who doubted the existence of Akkadian as an independent\r\nlanguage.[702] Sayce and his disciple Hommel added the speech of the\r\nKossaeans to the same group.[703] They were indeed disposed to create a\r\nnew family of languages which they called Alarodian,[704] and included\r\nwithin it the Elamite, embracing New and Old Susian, Kassite,[705]\r\nHittite[706] and Vannic.[707] They considered that the nearest modern\r\nrepresentative of this language is the Georgian and Basque, an opinion\r\nwhich, it will be remembered, had somewhat fascinated both Westergaard\r\nand Rawlinson. The propriety of this classification was, however, doubted\r\nby Lenormant, and it has never been satisfactorily established.[708]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nDECIPHERMENT OF THE THIRD OR BABYLONIAN COLUMN—HINCKS AND RAWLINSON—A.D.\r\n1846-1851\r\n\r\n\r\nThe task of deciphering the Third or Babylonian Column led to far more\r\nimportant results, and cannot be so briefly summarised. The earliest\r\ninscriptions found in Babylonia were observed to consist of two\r\nwell-marked styles of writing the cuneiform character. One of these\r\nstyles was to be seen on the Michaux Stone, published in the Collection\r\nof Millin. The other occurs on the numerous bricks that were picked up\r\nupon the ancient site of Babylon, and on a number of cylinders. But the\r\nmost remarkable example of this style was found in the long inscription\r\nobtained by Sir Harford Jones and published by the East India Company.\r\nThe first style is by far the simplest, and it is known as the Cursive or\r\nNew Babylonian; the other is so elaborate that Grotefend called it the\r\n‘Zierschrift’;[709] but it is generally described as the Lapidary or Old\r\nBabylonian. All the early scholars were struck by the close similarity of\r\nthe writing in the third column at Persepolis to the first or simplest\r\nform of Babylonian. Münter went a step farther, and pointed out that the\r\nsimilarity extended to the Old Babylonian of the brick inscriptions. In\r\nthe collection of inscriptions made by Mr. Rich, he thought he discerned\r\nthree well-marked varieties of writing; but he was able to announce that\r\nGrotefend, after a careful comparison, considered that they were all\r\nclosely related to one another and to the third Persepolitan.[710] It was\r\nsoon recognised that there are in fact only two varieties of Babylonian,\r\nand what Mr. Rich supposed to be a third is due only to the vagaries of\r\nthe scribe, or, as Rawlinson explained, it ‘arises from the distortion of\r\noblique elongation.’[711] It was long, however, before the identification\r\nof the two systems was satisfactorily established. In the fifth volume\r\nof the ‘Fundgruben des Orients’ Grotefend demonstrated the essential\r\nidentity of the third Persepolitan and the simple Babylonian, and in\r\nthe following volume he illustrated the similarity of the two systems\r\nof Babylonian.[712] In 1840 he succeeded in identifying a few lapidary\r\ncharacters with their equivalents in New Babylonian. In his contribution\r\nto the subject he endeavoured to render the names of Hystaspes and\r\nDarius into the two Babylonian forms.[713] In Hystaspes he seems to\r\nhave succeeded in only one character—the lapidary sign for ‘as’—but his\r\nspelling out of Darius was correct, both in the cursive and lapidary\r\nforms.[714] He was able also to recognise that certain inscriptions on\r\nvases written in the cursive style reproduced in part the same text as\r\nthose on the bricks written in the lapidary style. With a little farther\r\nstudy he would have been able, from the material collected in this Table,\r\nto draw up a short list of equivalent signs in the two systems. As it\r\nwas, he left this demonstration to be accomplished by Dr. Hincks in a\r\nmuch more successful manner than it was in his power to attempt. He had\r\nobserved indeed that certain words in the East India House inscription\r\ncorresponded to those found on the bricks, and he has collected them\r\ntogether in line 19 of his Table, and placed them word for word below the\r\nbrick inscription for purposes of comparison.[715] But both are in the\r\nsame lapidary character, and their juxtaposition served only to show that\r\nthe same words, and possibly portions of the same sentence, were to be\r\nfound in each. Grotefend, as we shall soon see, had not the smallest idea\r\nof their meaning. It was the good fortune of Dr. Hincks to observe that\r\nportions of the text of the East India House inscription are reproduced\r\nin a fragmentary inscription written in cursive characters and published\r\nby Ker Porter.[716] This, as he says, was ‘a most important discovery,\r\nas the equivalence of certain cursive and lapidary characters which bore\r\nscarcely any resemblance to one another was thus demonstrated, as well\r\nas the equivalence to each other of different lapidary characters which\r\nare constantly transcribed by one and the same cursive character.’ By\r\nthis means he succeeded in drawing up a Table of seventy-six cursive\r\ncharacters, selected from the third Persepolitan column, and placing\r\nopposite each its equivalent lapidary sign taken from the East India\r\nHouse inscription.[717]\r\n\r\nHitherto the cuneiform inscriptions known to Europe had been practically\r\nlimited to the Persepolitan and Babylonian styles of writing. A few\r\nexamples of different varieties were, however, beginning to crowd upon\r\nthe bewildered student. Almost the first examples of the Assyrian style\r\nwere collected by Mr. Rich in 1820, during his visit to Nineveh, and\r\nthese were subsequently acquired by the British Museum.[718] In 1827,\r\nSchulz found about forty inscriptions at Van, written in a very similar\r\ncharacter, and these were published in the ‘Journal Asiatique’ of\r\n1840.[719] A prism with a long inscription was discovered at Nineveh in\r\n1830, but it does not seem to have become accessible till purchased by\r\nColonel Taylor in 1846.[720] In 1840, Mr. Layard copied an inscription at\r\nMalamir that presented another striking variety. But the first period of\r\ngreat discoveries in Assyria had now approached. In 1843, M. Botta, the\r\nFrench Consul at Mosul, began his excavations in the mound at Khorsabad,\r\nand he soon uncovered the remains of a palace. He found the doors\r\nadorned with monumental bulls, and the walls decorated with bas-reliefs\r\nand inscriptions. He described the result in a series of letters to M.\r\nMohl, which appeared in the ‘Journal Asiatique’ between May 1843 and\r\nJune 1845. M. Flandin was hastily commissioned to take sketches; but\r\nfortunately the task of copying the inscriptions was left entirely to\r\nBotta. He faithfully transcribed upwards of two hundred, many of them\r\nbeing, however, exact or slightly varied reproductions of each other.\r\nA large collection of sculptures found its way to the Louvre, and the\r\ndrawings and inscriptions made their appearance in 1849 in the great work\r\n‘Monument de Ninive.’ Like many similar productions in France, it was\r\nexecuted upon such a splendid scale as to place it practically beyond the\r\nreach of ordinary students. The inscriptions were, however, afterwards\r\npublished separately; and M. Botta contributed a valuable essay on the\r\nnewly found ‘Ecriture Assyrienne’ (1848).[721]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mr. Layard was rapidly accumulating treasures upon even a\r\ngreater scale for the British Museum. He began to excavate at Nimrud—the\r\nancient Caleh—in November 1845, and speedily brought to light the remains\r\nof three buildings, known as the North-West, Central and South-West\r\nPalaces. In the following year he extended his labours to Kouyunjik, a\r\nmound on the site of Nineveh, where he unearthed a palace of unusual\r\nsize, which he found had been erected by the son of the Khorsabad king.\r\nHe was rewarded by the discovery of the vast treasures now preserved\r\nin the British Museum—colossal bulls and lions, winged human figures,\r\nand many other symbolical objects; long rows of bas-reliefs depicting\r\nbattles, sieges and hunting scenes, and large numbers of inscriptions.\r\nOne of the most important of these was found in the autumn of 1846 on\r\na black obelisk in the central palace of Nimrud. It consists of two\r\nhundred and ten lines, and enjoys the distinction of being the first\r\npurely Assyrian inscription that was ever deciphered.[722] Of scarcely\r\nless importance was the discovery of an inscription upon the pavement\r\nwhere the names and titles of five kings were clearly recorded. Their\r\nnames could not indeed be read as yet, but sufficient was already\r\nknown from a comparison with the Persian inscriptions to indicate the\r\ngenealogical relationship of the unknown sovereign. The Assyrian signs\r\nfor ‘king,’ ‘son of’ and a few others had been made out, which left no\r\ndoubt as to the meaning of the document. It began with the father of the\r\nfounder of the North-West Palace, and ended with the grandson of the\r\nbuilder of the Central Palace. On his return to England, in 1847, Layard\r\nwrote an account of ‘Nineveh and its Remains,’ but the work did not\r\nappear till 1849. It was followed in the same year by the ‘Monuments of\r\nNineveh,’ which contained drawings of the bas-reliefs and copies of the\r\ninscriptions.\r\n\r\nTwo great collections of Assyrian inscriptions were now in the hands\r\nof scholars, who found themselves face to face with the difficult\r\nproblems they suggested. In England the task was divided between Hincks\r\nand Rawlinson; but Mr. Norris, Dr. Birch, and Mr. Layard gave valuable\r\nassistance in the publication of documents. Mr. Norris was farther\r\nengaged in the study of the Susian texts. In France the work was taken\r\nup by Botta, Löwenstern and De Saulcy. M. Oppert does not seem to have\r\nturned his attention to this branch of the subject till 1857, when for\r\nthe first time France was worthily represented. Germany was silent,\r\nexcept for a few contributions made by Grotefend in his declining years\r\nthat added little to the general progress.\r\n\r\nNothing could at first be more bewildering than the immense number\r\nof signs. Grotefend counted only a hundred and thirty different\r\ncharacters in the third Persepolitan column. Mr. Fisher, in 1807,\r\nfound that the East India House inscription contained two hundred and\r\neighty-seven;[723] and Grotefend, in 1837, estimated that the whole\r\nof the Babylonian inscriptions known to him contained about three\r\nhundred different signs.[724] But Botta encountered no less than six\r\nhundred and forty-two at Khorsabad alone.[725] The unskilled eye will\r\nbe disposed to agree with Löwenstern that at first sight the Ninevite\r\ncharacter presented no analogy with the Persepolitan, or even with the\r\ncharacters on the Babylonian bricks. In his ‘Essai de Déchiffrement’\r\n(1845) he was, however, the first to point out that a large number of\r\nthem do really correspond to the third Persepolitan; and he based his\r\nattempted interpretation partly upon the analogy he had discovered.[726]\r\nIn his first Essay, of 1846, Hincks also stated his belief that ‘the\r\nthird Persepolitan agrees in character with the Babylonian and with the\r\nAssyrian writing in Schulz’s inscriptions.’[727] Löwenstern afterwards\r\nadmitted that he would scarcely have recognised the similarity from\r\nSchulz’s plates; but it became clearly apparent in the more perfect\r\ndrawing of Texier.[728] Indeed he was eventually so much struck by\r\nthe resemblance that he hesitated to classify the Persepolitan with\r\nthe Babylonian in preference to the Assyrian; in fact, he ultimately\r\npersuaded himself that it was nearer the Assyrian. Meanwhile Botta\r\nhad begun the minute study of the Assyrian character to which later\r\ninvestigators owe more than they are always willing to acknowledge.[729]\r\nThose whose fortune it is to occupy the higher pinnacles of knowledge\r\nare only too prone to despise the humbler artificers who constructed the\r\nscaffolding that enabled them to achieve the ascent. Botta arranged the\r\nsigns with great care into fifteen classes, according to the number of\r\nwedges they contain. The first class included all those with one wedge\r\nonly; and so on up to the fifteenth class, where we find signs composed\r\nof fifteen wedges and upwards: though none appear to exceed eighteen.\r\nThe result of his classification was to persuade him that the graphic\r\nsystem of Assyria was substantially the same as that found at Persepolis\r\nand Babylon. He accepted Rich and Westergaard as the most faithful\r\ncopyists of the former, and he compared ninety-six of their signs with\r\nthose at Khorsabad. He found that seventy-two were so similar that\r\ntheir identity could not fail to be recognised at first sight. Fourteen\r\nothers exhibit a greater difference, but their identity is capable of\r\ndemonstration. There are therefore eighty-six signs out of ninety-six\r\nconcerning which no doubt can exist. He thought the difference was not\r\nso great as between Gothic and Latin characters. With respect to the\r\nwriting at Van, he counted a hundred and twelve to a hundred and fifteen\r\ncharacters, and he found that ninety-eight or a hundred were reproduced\r\nidentically at Khorsabad.[730] When he began to write upon this subject\r\nhe had only just received a copy of the East India House inscription, and\r\nit was some time before he could hazard an opinion as to the relationship\r\nof the New Assyrian to the Old Babylonian.[731] The result of a first\r\nstudy of the two hundred and eighty-seven signs in the East India House\r\ninscription was the identification of a hundred and seven of the signs\r\nwith the Assyrian, and a more careful investigation ultimately raised the\r\nnumber to one hundred and seventy-nine.[732] The remaining one hundred\r\nand eight have not, he says, any proper equivalent at Khorsabad. He\r\nwas inclined to attribute a good deal of the diversity to the material\r\nand the instrument used. Where, for example, the stone was brittle, as\r\nat Van, the engraver showed a disinclination to make the wedges cross,\r\nand the chisel would naturally produce a different effect from the\r\nimpress of a wedge upon soft clay. Much also was, no doubt, due to the\r\nindividuality of the scribes, who seemed to think they might increase or\r\ndiminish the number of the wedges according to fancy. Others were simple\r\nerrors on the part of the original scribe or his copyist, and some may\r\nhave been intended for abbreviations. He did not believe it possible to\r\nestablish any fundamental distinctions between any of these styles. Thus\r\nhe thought the Taylor prism combined the differences peculiar to Nineveh\r\nand Babylon so equally that it would be impossible to decide to which\r\nclass it really belongs. He concluded, therefore, that, notwithstanding\r\nconsiderable apparent variety, there was substantial identity; and that\r\none and the same mode of writing prevailed in Assyria and Babylon, at Van\r\nand Persepolis. Indeed he went so far as to suppose that whoever could\r\nread a Khorsabad inscription would be able also to read all the others.\r\nIt is true he could not himself read or pronounce a single word with any\r\ndegree of certainty;[733] and Rawlinson declared that his special studies\r\nafforded him no facility. He could, he says, read the Babylonian of the\r\nthird column, but he has not ‘yet succeeded in identifying a single name\r\nin the tablets of Van or Khorsabad.’[734]\r\n\r\nAt first indeed Rawlinson was much more impressed by the diversity than\r\nby the similarity of the signs, and he described them as ‘constituting\r\nvarieties of alphabetical formation.’ He divided Babylonian into the\r\nwriting of the third Persepolitan and that of the bricks and cylinders;\r\nthe latter he considered was the primitive form ‘which must have embodied\r\nthe vernacular dialect of Shinar, when the earth was of one language and\r\none speech.’ Assyrian he also divided into two classes, Assyrian proper\r\nand Medo-Assyrian or Vannic; but he also distinguished Assyrian proper\r\ninto two subdivisions, representing the lapidary and the running hand—a\r\nspecimen of the latter being the Taylor prism. The Elymaean inscriptions\r\nhe placed in a class apart, ‘as entitled to an independent rank.’ He\r\npointed out that even the third Persepolitan writing is not identical\r\nwith the cursive Babylonian, and that the variation is sufficient to\r\nconstitute a serious impediment to study. The writing on the Assyrian\r\ncylinders is ‘quite distinct from any variety of character which occurs\r\non similar relics at Babylon’; and he found ‘characters at Van that\r\nnever occur at Khorsabad and _vice versa_.’ He cannot, therefore, agree\r\nwith Botta that they all ‘belong to one single alphabetical system,’ and\r\nthat the differences are merely ‘varieties of hand.’[735] Farther study,\r\nhowever, led him to alter his opinion, and in 1850 he admits that ‘there\r\nis no doubt but that the alphabets of Assyria, of Armenia, of Babylonia,\r\nof Susiana and of Elymais are, so far as essentials are concerned, one\r\nand the same. There are peculiarities of form, a limitation of usage—but\r\nunquestionably the alphabets are “au fond” identical.’ Mr. Layard had\r\nalso arrived at the same conclusion. In his opinion, the varieties\r\nappear to be mere ‘caligraphical distinctions.’[736]\r\n\r\nThe same important discovery was soon afterwards extended, as we have\r\nalready related, to include the writing in the second or Susian column\r\nof the Persepolitan inscriptions. In 1846, Hincks called attention\r\nto the similarity that existed between them. Both the Babylonian and\r\nAssyrian modes of writing, he says, ‘agree in principle with the second\r\nPersepolitan,’ and he farther observed that where the characters are\r\nthe same, they have generally the same, or nearly the same, value in\r\nall three.[737] It is curious that Botta was quite unable to trace the\r\nexistence of this resemblance. Writing of the three columns, he says:\r\n‘The elements of the groups are in each quite different, and even when\r\nthe form agrees the sound is quite different’; and this opinion was\r\nshared by Westergaard, who, as we have said, maintained that the various\r\nspecies of cuneiform writing ‘differed from one another in the shape of\r\nnearly every letter or group.’[738]\r\n\r\nA good deal has been said from the time of Botta downwards as to the\r\nsimilarity of the various styles. There is no doubt that they are\r\nsufficiently formidable to require a special training in reading\r\neach kind,[739] and the Assyrians themselves found it necessary to\r\nmake transcriptions from the Babylonian in order to make the writing\r\nintelligible. There was a greater diversity in the writing of Babylonian\r\nthan of Assyrian, in consequence of there being no standard official\r\ntype in the former as there was in the Assyrian,[740] and consequently\r\na copyist sometimes altogether mistook a sign, and occasionally he was\r\nactually unable even to divine its meaning; indeed, so great was the\r\ndiversity in the manner of writing that the Assyrian scribes made use of\r\nTables of Variants, and in one of these no less than twenty different\r\nways of writing the same sign have been found. On the whole, most\r\nstudents will be inclined to agree with Mr. Budge, who dwells more on the\r\ndifferences than the similarity of the styles.[741]\r\n\r\nThe demonstration of the similarity of the cuneiform writing of\r\nBabylon and Assyria was followed by the more important discovery that\r\nthe languages expressed by both were the same as that of the third\r\nPersepolitan column. The Persian, now deciphered and translated, was thus\r\nfound to afford a key, not only to the language of the third column, but\r\nalso to the large collection of inscriptions from Nineveh. Hincks, in\r\na Postscript of June 1846, to which reference will be frequently made,\r\nannounces that he believes the third Persepolitan ‘agrees, to a great\r\nextent at least, in language with the Babylonian inscriptions.’[742] In\r\n1848, Botta endeavoured to establish beyond the possibility of doubt that\r\nthe Assyrian of Khorsabad likewise agreed with the language of Babylon\r\nand Persepolis. He showed that the same grammatical inflexions, the same\r\npersonal pronouns, the same particles, and very many words agreed in\r\nall three languages. With regard to the inscriptions at Van, Botta was\r\nat first in doubt, but farther study led him to believe that here the\r\ninflexions were not the same.[743] This was subsequently fully recognised\r\nby Hincks[744] and by most other scholars. It did not, however, prevent\r\nDe Saulcy from hazarding a translation of one of them on the supposition\r\nthat it was written in Semitic.[745] In 1850, Rawlinson agreed that\r\nboth the Babylonian and Assyrian languages are to be included in a\r\ncommon category; but he added that ‘they can hardly be called identical,\r\ninasmuch as each dialect affects the employment of specific verbal roots\r\nand certain particular nouns and adjectives.’[746] They are, in fact,\r\ndistinguished by certain dialectical differences which have been compared\r\nin degree to that existing between the dialects of the West and North of\r\nEngland; but other authorities think the differences scarcely amount to\r\nprovincialism.[747]\r\n\r\nThe suggestion that the newly-discovered language would turn out to\r\nbe Semitic was made at an early period of the inquiry. It had not,\r\nhowever, occurred to Grotefend, who described it, in 1837, as Parsi,\r\nand in 1840 he had apparently returned to his original opinion that it\r\nwas Pehlevi, and he expressly rejected a suggestion of Lepsius that the\r\nwriting might be compared to Phoenician.[748] Before the decipherment of\r\nthe cuneiform every conceivable hypothesis had been started as to the\r\nprobable affinities of the Ancient Assyrian language.[749] At length, in\r\n1845, Löwenstern recollected that the Jewish Scriptures place Assur in\r\nthe same ethnological division as Heber, and he concluded that Assyrian\r\nmust therefore have been a Semitic speech.[750] In June 1846, Hincks\r\nalso announced that ‘both Assyrian and Babylonian appear to have much in\r\ncommon with the Semitic languages’;[751] and in the following January he\r\nstated emphatically that they ‘exhibit a much greater similarity to the\r\nother Semitic languages than I had at first supposed.’ In consequence of\r\nthis similarity, he now for the first time sets the fashion, afterwards\r\ngenerally adopted, of classifying the signs according to the letters of\r\nthe Hebrew alphabet, and he endeavoured for a brief time to assimilate\r\nthe vowel system to the Semitic method.[752] In a tract written in 1847\r\nLöwenstern dwelt with increasing force upon the Semitic affinities of\r\nthe language; and he considered that Rawlinson is fundamentally wrong in\r\napplying the laws of an Aryan speech ‘to a writing and a language that\r\nare Semitic.’[753] It cannot be said that he contributed much towards\r\nthe proof of his assertion. He was entirely mistaken in the fundamental\r\nprinciple of his comparison, the supposed similarity of the vowel systems\r\nof the two languages; but he pointed out the analogy of a few words, such\r\nas ‘rabu,’ ‘great,’ to its Hebrew equivalent, and this was the only word\r\nwhich, according to Menant, was then correctly read.[754] In the December\r\nprevious, Hincks pointed out that the personal pronoun in Assyrian reads\r\n‘a-na-ku,’ but he left it to the learning of his readers to recognise\r\nthe identity of this word with the Hebrew. This was afterwards done by\r\nBotta,[755] who, however, continued on the whole to be doubtful of the\r\nSemitic affinities of Assyrian.[756]\r\n\r\nIn 1849, De Saulcy contributed two memoirs on cuneiform, which seem to\r\nhave added considerably to the proof.[757] In the first he is said to\r\nhave shown that the two languages agreed in the feminine termination\r\n_t_ and in the relative pronoun ‘sha’; and in the second he identified\r\nthe particles for ‘and’ and ‘with.’[758] In the following year, Hincks\r\nadded other forms and words that could be best explained by reference\r\nto the Hebrew;[759] and Rawlinson definitely settled the question by an\r\nelaborate comparison of its grammatical forms and vocabulary with those\r\nof other Semitic languages.[760] Since that time its affinity to the\r\nSemitic family has been fully accepted. Rawlinson showed that Babylonian\r\nis found in a more primitive state than any other of the Semitic dialects\r\nof Asia open to our research. It is held to be the oldest representative\r\nof that family yet known, ‘the Ethiopic ranking next in point of\r\nantiquity.’[761]\r\n\r\nHincks declared that it bears the same relationship to Semitic as\r\nSanscrit to Aryan, an opinion shared by Mr. Sayce and Professor Haupt.\r\nIt properly belongs to the northern group, which includes Hebrew,\r\nPhoenician, Syriac and Chaldee; but there is some disagreement as to the\r\ndegree of relationship.[762] Mr. King describes it as ‘closely akin’\r\nto the northern group, while Mr. Pinches considers the differences\r\nare often very great, especially in the verbs.[763] Mr. Boscawen\r\nfinds striking affinities in grammar to Arabic, one of the southern\r\ngroup.[764] It was some time, however, before these opinions prevailed.\r\nM. Luzzato, in 1850, still maintained that Assyrian was an Indo-European\r\nlanguage;[765] and Holtzmann that it was a Persian dialect mingled with\r\nSemitic elements.[766] Botta long remained in doubt, and Hitzig did not\r\nhesitate to deny that it is Semitic.[767] So late as 1858 Ewald, the\r\nGerman Hebraist, entirely refused to accept the grammatical forms of\r\nAssyrian as Semitic.[768] M. Renan wrote to the same effect in 1859,\r\nand he even retained his doubts in the fourth edition of his ‘Langues\r\nSémitiques,’ published in 1863.[769] The recent discoveries were indeed\r\npeculiarly unacceptable to M. Renan. Not long before, he had laid down\r\nthat monotheism was the special ‘note’ of the Semitic races, and he\r\nwas naturally extremely disconcerted by the unexpected apparition in\r\nthe Louvre of a profusion of Assyrian gods, according as they were dug\r\nup by M. Botta. In 1865 we are still assured that Assyrian, ‘though of\r\nthe Semitic type, is only distantly connected with known forms of that\r\nlanguage.’[770]\r\n\r\nIt is much easier to determine the grammatical affinity of a language\r\nthan to read it, and the place of Babylonian in the family of languages\r\nwas definitely fixed before much progress was made in the work of\r\ntranslation. From the time that Grotefend’s attention was first directed\r\nto cuneiform research, he endeavoured to include the second and third\r\ncolumns, no less than the first, within his sphere of inquiry. But he\r\nachieved very little success. In his Essay published by Heeren (1824) we\r\nfind that he had already singled out the groups in the third column that\r\ncorresponded to Cyrus, Hystaspes, Darius and Xerxes. The Babylonian,\r\nunlike the Persian, has no sign to mark the division of the words, and\r\nthe difficulty attending their separation was at first very great. The\r\nprocess was facilitated when it was recognised that each line begins and\r\nends with a word: that is to say, a word is never divided and carried\r\nover from one line to another. In 1837, Grotefend successfully divided\r\neight lines of the Elvend inscription, with only a slight mistake. He\r\nalso divided the B inscription of Darius nearly correctly: the exception\r\nbeing that at the end of his first line he seems to treat three words as\r\none.[771] Nor was the difficulty confined to the separation of the words\r\nonly. Some of the signs are so long that they were at first mistaken for\r\ntwo or more letters. Thus the sign for _ar_ in the word for Xerxes was\r\ntreated by Grotefend as _th_ and _r_;[772] and Löwenstern divided the\r\nsign for _gi_ into _r_ and _s_, which continued for a long time to be a\r\nsource of trouble.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 Grotefend gives a Table to show the transliteration of his four\r\nroyal names. He reads Cyrus ‘Kho · re · s’ for ‘Ku · ra · as’; Hystaspes\r\n‘Wi · scht · as · p’ for ‘Us · ta · as · pa’; Darius ‘Da · r · ha · a ·\r\nwesch’ for ‘Da · ri · ya · a · vus’; Xerxes ‘Kh · sch · ah · th · r ·\r\nsch’ for ‘Hi · si’ar · si.’[773]\r\n\r\nWe have here sixteen different signs with their values attached; and of\r\nthese only three (_as_, _da_, _a_) are absolutely correct; though the\r\nothers give the consonantal values. These values appeared substantially\r\nin his tract of 1837, with the addition of ‘wo-hu’ for the signs that\r\nread ‘rabu.’[774] Hincks, writing in December 1846, makes the very\r\nliberal admission that perhaps Grotefend knew the values of ten cursive\r\ncharacters correctly and of ten others approximately.[775]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the transliteration that he recognised some of the\r\nsigns as syllabic and some as alphabetical. He also knew there was a\r\nsingle sign for ‘son,’ which, he points out, occurred as _a_ in Darius;\r\nand he had found three of the equivalent signs for ‘king.’ It is not\r\nimprobable that if he had persevered in analysing a larger number of\r\nproper names, he might eventually have reached other solid results.\r\nUnfortunately, these were not readily accessible. The I inscription,\r\nthat yielded so much assistance to Burnouf and Lassen, had no Babylonian\r\nequivalent; and Westergaard had not yet copied the one at Naksh-i-Rustam.\r\nFailing the only true method, he had recourse to another that once more\r\ncarried him far away to another ‘constellation of Moro.’\r\n\r\nThere was much speculation as to what could be the signification of\r\na certain inscription found on cylinder seals and ‘holy’ vases, and\r\nreproduced with amplification on the bricks collected by Mr. Rich at\r\nBabylon. Hager had long ago thrown out the useful suggestion that the\r\nbrick inscriptions most probably recorded the name of the maker or\r\nthe builder; but this opinion did not ultimately find favour. It was\r\ncontended that the inscriptions on the seals and ‘holy’ vases must have a\r\nreligious import, and were no doubt used as talismans, in accordance with\r\nOriental custom; and nothing could be more natural than that the same\r\nmystical formulae should be impressed upon the bricks, in order to banish\r\nthe evil demons from the precincts of the building. Grotefend accordingly\r\nlooked about for guidance, and at length found something to suit his\r\npurpose in the Zend-Avesta. He collected a number of brick inscriptions\r\ntogether, and placed under them such portions of the inscriptions on\r\nseals and ‘holy’ vases as he found to correspond. They are not, however,\r\nexactly alike, for in the latter two or more words are omitted from the\r\nmiddle of the sentence. The first legend contains sixteen words and,\r\naccording to Grotefend, it runs thus: ‘(1) Ich erhebe (2) demüthigst (3)\r\nden grossen (4) König (5) Mithras (6) immerdar (7) mit Grösse (8) und\r\nmit Stärke (9) an diesem (10) öffentlichen Orte (11) Ja (12) ich erhebe\r\n(13) diesen (14) grossen (15) König (16) Mithras.’ The legend taken\r\nfrom the brick of Nebuchadnezzar (line 13) differs slightly from this.\r\nThe name of the king or god is not the same (words 5 and 16); and the\r\ntwo words ‘öffentlichen Orte,’ ‘ja,’ are also different. At the end, a\r\nseventeenth word is added, signifying, as is supposed, ‘sei gnädig.’ Such\r\nwas the last attempt at translation before the breaking of the new light.\r\nThe meaning of this inscription is now known to be: ‘(words 1, 2, 3)\r\nNabu-kudur-usur, (4) King (5) of Babylon, (6-10) Restorer of Bit-Saggatu\r\nand of Bit-Zida, (11) eldest son (12, 13, 14) of Nabu-pal-usur, (15) King\r\n(16) of Babylon, (17) I.’[776]\r\n\r\nLöwenstern, in his ‘Essai de Déchiffrement,’ published in 1845,\r\ncontributed little to the progress of the study. He, however, boldly\r\nattempted to pass beyond the guidance of the Persepolitan inscriptions,\r\nand to decipher two proper names in an inscription recently found at\r\nKhorsabad. The one he selected is engraved over a bas-relief and appears\r\nin Botta (Plate 25). The subject evidently referred to the capture of\r\na city, and Löwenstern learned from the Hebrew Scriptures that the\r\nAssyrians had only captured four important places. One of these was\r\nAsdod, which was taken by Esarhaddon, and the appearance of sea in the\r\nbas-relief left no doubt that this was the place referred to. He had\r\nthus ingeniously conjectured the names of the city and the conqueror\r\nby independent means; and there was little difficulty in fixing the\r\ncuneiform groups in which they were to be found. We have already said\r\nthat Löwenstern observed the close resemblance between the Assyrian and\r\nPersepolitan characters; and he at first thought that the similarity\r\nextended to the square writing of the Hebrews. It was by comparison with\r\nthese that he sought to achieve his decipherment. The name of the town\r\nconsisted of five characters. The first he did not know, but assumed to\r\nbe _a_; the second corresponded exactly to the Hebrew ‘shin,’ the third\r\nto the Old Persian _d_; and, pursuing this method, he satisfied himself\r\nthat he had deciphered ‘Asdoh’ or ‘Asdod.’ Botta afterwards pointed out\r\nthat the word had been improperly transcribed, and that the first sign,\r\ntranslated _a_, was simply the determinative of ‘city.’[777] As regards\r\nthe group that should contain the name of Esarhaddon, Löwenstern thought\r\nit consisted of three signs. The first, he erroneously stated, had been\r\nascertained by Grotefend to be _r_;[778] the second was already known as\r\n_s_ in ‘Asdod’; the third bore a remote resemblance to the Hebrew ‘koph’\r\nturned over on its side. It remained to adapt the result, _r_ _s_ _k_, to\r\nthe name of Esarhaddon. The matter was simplified by Isaiah, who calls\r\nthe king in whose reign Asdod was captured Sargon. Another reading of\r\nthis name is ‘Sarak,’ which is evidently the word in the inscription,\r\nthe transposition of the _r_ and _s_ being obviously unimportant. It\r\nhappened, curiously enough, that Löwenstern guessed the name of the\r\nKhorsabad king correctly, but his transliteration was entirely at fault.\r\nTwo years later, Longpérier pointed out that he had omitted the first\r\nsign of the name altogether; and Botta protested against the separation\r\nof the second sign into two, in order to evolve _r_ and _s_.[779]\r\n\r\nIn June 1846 Hincks began the series of contributions to the subject\r\nwhich he continued down to the time of his death, twenty years later. In\r\nhis first paper he tells us he had just begun to apply himself to the\r\nthird Persepolitan, which, he says, he found to agree in ‘character and,\r\nto a great extent at least, in language with the Babylonian inscriptions,\r\nand to the Assyrian writing in Schulz’s inscriptions.’ ‘In both,’ he\r\nsays, ‘some of the characters represent elementary sounds and some\r\n[represent] combinations. In both, two or more characters are used to\r\nrepresent the same sounds. In both, no vowel is omitted; but vowels and\r\nconsonants are repeated in two consecutive characters.’ He also ‘found\r\nit to be a general rule, though it admits of some exceptions, that when\r\na character occurred in two or more alphabets, it had the same value, or\r\nnearly so, in all of them.’ Thus the _pa_ of the second Persepolitan is\r\n_pa_ in Assyrian, and _ba_ in Babylonian. He claimed to be able to read\r\nthe names of ‘Babylon’ and ‘Nineveh’ on certain bricks that had been\r\nbrought from those places.[780]\r\n\r\nA few months later he was able to announce that he had ‘made considerable\r\nprogress in deciphering the Babylonian cursive and also the lapidary\r\ncharacter of the East India House inscription.’ He found that the\r\nwriting in the third Persepolitan column was identical with the former,\r\nor cursive, style, and that its title to be called the ‘Babylonian\r\ncolumn’ was therefore incontestable.\r\n\r\nThe only predecessor he will allow to have had in this inquiry is\r\nGrotefend, who has discovered, he says, that the Babylonian characters\r\nare partly syllabic and partly literal; and that ‘certain lapidary\r\ncharacters correspond to certain cursive ones.’ Grotefend, he adds,\r\nmay also have discovered the values of about ten cursive characters\r\ncorrectly, and possibly of ten others approximately. But he was not\r\naware that ‘several equivalent characters might be in use to represent\r\nthe same letter or syllable.’[781] Hincks was, however, more adequately\r\nsupplied with materials to work with. Besides the Persepolitan\r\ninscriptions which he had the advantage to study in the more perfect\r\ncopies of Westergaard, he had also access to the list of provinces at\r\nNaksh-i-Rustam lately copied by the same traveller. The discovery that\r\na clay cylinder published by Porter reproduced in cursive characters a\r\nportion of the East India House inscription written in the lapidary style\r\nhad, as we have already seen, enabled him to compare together seventy-six\r\nsigns in the two different modes of writing. These he now attempted to\r\nclassify according to what he considered to be their values. The Table\r\nis the first of the kind that appeared, and is consequently of very\r\nexceptional interest. His decipherment was based in the usual manner upon\r\na comparison between the proper names in the Babylonian and those in\r\nthe Persian column. ‘But,’ he says, ‘even more [values] were determined\r\nby comparing different modes of writing the same word.’ His success, so\r\nfar as it goes, is certainly remarkable. He recognises correctly the\r\nsigns for the three principal vowels, _a_, _i_ and _u_ (Nos. 1, 4 and 7);\r\na second sign for _u_, used in the late Babylonian, is also correctly\r\nidentified. The breathing sign is rendered with approximate correctness\r\nby _ya_ (No. 2; _cf._ King 226), and the two diphthongs _ai_ and _ia_\r\nfigure as _yu_ and _ya_ (9 and 3). The list of consonantal sounds is,\r\nof course, far from complete; but it is remarkable that in the great\r\nmajority of cases the signs are presented to us as syllabic. They even\r\ninclude two compound syllables, ‘bar’ and ‘sar.’ They are distributed\r\namong twenty-one different sounds: _r_ or _er_, _ra_, _ru_; _n_, _na_,\r\n_nu_, _ana_; _ba_, _bu_, _bar_; _ak_, _ka_, _ku_; _ta_, _da_; _s_, _as_,\r\n_us_; _sa_, _su_, _sar_, and the signs for the plural. It will be seen\r\nthat this affords a remarkable anticipation of a later discovery. A\r\ncareful examination will show that, so far as the consonantal sounds are\r\nconcerned, there are extremely few errors. Indeed, out of fifty-five\r\nsigns, we have only found twelve radical mistakes in this respect. On\r\nthe other hand, he was able to give to many signs their absolutely\r\ncorrect syllabic value. At the time of writing he was of opinion that\r\nthe distinction between _i_ and _u_ was not observed; and he accordingly\r\nclassifies together the syllabic ending in either of these vowels.\r\nHe thought that the same confusion existed among the consonants. He\r\nconsidered that the language did not admit of distinction between _r_ and\r\n_l_, or between _b_ and _p_, or _w_ and _m_; nor between the gutturals\r\n_k_, _g_ and _kh_; nor between the sibilants; and that _ch_ is expressed\r\nby _s_, and _j_ by _k_. He identified the personal pronoun I—_a-na-ku_;\r\nand he read the name and titles of Nebuchadnezzar in various inscriptions\r\nwhich Grotefend had mistaken for forms of prayer. He saw clearly the\r\nideographic and determinative value of some of the signs, and fixed\r\ncorrectly upon those for ‘and,’ ‘son,’ ‘great,’ ‘earth,’ ‘one,’ ‘house,’\r\n‘god,’ ‘man’ (two), and another sign for ‘king’ not previously recognised\r\nby Grotefend. He also pointed out two signs for the plural. (December\r\n1846.)\r\n\r\nIn his paper of January 1847 he increases his list of primary signs to\r\nninety-five, and he analyses the remaining characters found in the East\r\nIndia House inscription published by Mr. Fisher in 1807. He thinks he has\r\nbeen able to assign values to a hundred and ninety-nine of these, and\r\nto attach them to some one or other of the ninety-five primary values\r\nto which, in his opinion, they corresponded. If this attempt had been\r\nsuccessful, he would have arrived at the values of the whole of the two\r\nhundred and eighty-seven signs in Mr. Fisher’s list, and a few others\r\nin addition. But the paper in other respects indicates a retrograde\r\ntendency. ‘The language,’ he says, ‘has been brought to exhibit a much\r\ngreater similarity to the Semitic ones than I had at first supposed.’\r\nHe accordingly abandons the ‘transcription of Babylonian words into\r\nRoman characters’ and assimilates them to the letters in the Hebrew\r\nalphabet.[782] He distributes the signs into classes according as he\r\nsupposes them to be labials, gutturals, dentals, nasals, linguals and\r\nsibilants. He does not attempt to subdivide the classes into surds and\r\nsonants, but he separates each class into two divisions, according as\r\nhe considers that the consonant is followed by _e_ (:_sheva_) or by _a_\r\n(-_pathac_). ‘Values different from these are annexed to the characters\r\nwhich admit them.’ In so far as each sign is inseparably attached to one\r\nor other vowel the system remains syllabic; but his new table exhibits\r\na strong desire to revert, if possible, to an alphabetical system in\r\ncorrespondence with the Hebrew. His study of the inscriptions at Van\r\nenabled him, even at this early date, to give ‘the mode of expressing\r\nnumbers in cuneatic characters from 1 to 100,000’: a system he farther\r\nexemplified in his later paper on the Van inscriptions.\r\n\r\nHis manipulation of the two hundred and eighty-seven signs induced him to\r\ntake a much too favourable opinion of his own achievement, for we find\r\nhim, in the course of the following year (May 1848), announcing that\r\n‘the values of the great majority of the [Babylonian] characters are,\r\nin my judgment, already settled beyond the reach of criticism,’[783]\r\na statement which we now know is, in fact ‘beyond the range of\r\ncriticism.’ By that time he had, however, made the important discovery\r\nthat Sennacherib and Esarhaddon were the builders of the two palaces\r\nat Nineveh. He would not, however, admit that Sargon was the Khorsabad\r\nking, a fact that had just been demonstrated with remarkable ingenuity by\r\nLongpérier.[784] Hincks suggested that the proper reading was Ni-Shar.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark that the writings we have just reviewed of Hincks,\r\nin 1846-7, were brought to the notice of Continental students by Mohl, in\r\nhis ‘Rapport’ to the Société Asiatique of 1848.\r\n\r\nIt is, in fact, in these essays that the first real progress in the\r\ndecipherment of Babylonian was made. In them Hincks laid the foundation\r\nupon which all subsequent work was raised, a work to which he himself\r\ncontributed no small share.\r\n\r\nThe year 1847 was especially rich in contributions to the study. It\r\nopened with the remarkable paper we have just reviewed; and during its\r\ncourse Rawlinson expounded his views in the ‘Journal of the Asiatic\r\nSociety,’ Botta in the ‘Journal Asiatique,’ Longpérier in the ‘Revue\r\nArchéologique.’ Löwenstern added another Memoir of greater value than\r\nthe first, and De Saulcy made his appearance in this field of inquiry by\r\na paper communicated to the Académie des Inscriptions, and by two essays\r\nthat have exposed him to much criticism.\r\n\r\nHincks, as we have seen, had worked exclusively upon the Persepolitan\r\nand Babylonian texts; but the great discoveries of Botta and Layard\r\nsoon diverted attention to the more ample materials that were beginning\r\nto pour in from Khorsabad and Nimrud. We have already alluded to the\r\nenormous number of different signs that were found to be employed in\r\nthe Assyrian inscriptions—no less than six hundred and forty-two,\r\naccording to Botta’s computation. It seemed incredible that they could\r\nall convey different shades of sound. Grotefend noticed that even in\r\nthe third Persepolitan some signs appeared to be interchangeable, and\r\ntherefore presumably of similar value; and this peculiarity became even\r\nmore noticeable in Babylonian.[785] Hincks, as we have seen, noticed\r\n‘the equivalence to each other of different lapidary characters, which\r\nare constantly transcribed by one and the same cursive character.’\r\nIn a paper read before the Académie des Inscriptions in 1845, Botta\r\nexplained that many Assyrian characters of very different form were\r\nfrequently substituted for one another, and the inference was that\r\nthere are several signs to express the same, or nearly the same, sound.\r\nRawlinson’s attention, up to the present, had been almost entirely fixed\r\nupon the Persian column of the Behistun inscription, and his version\r\nof it appeared early in 1847. He saw that it afforded the ‘only key to\r\nthe decipherment of the Babylonian alphabet.’[786] We have observed\r\nthat Grotefend found himself practically limited to four proper names;\r\nLöwenstern had only twenty to work upon;[787] while Hincks and De\r\nSaulcy, with the addition of the Naksh-i-Rustam inscription, had forty.\r\nFrom the Behistun and other sources now available to Rawlinson, the\r\nnumber gradually rose to ninety-four;[788] and with these before him, he\r\nbegan to apply himself to ‘the determination of the phonetic powers of\r\nthe characters.’ Among the new names was that of Nebuchadnezzar, which he\r\nat once recognised was the same as occurred so frequently on the bricks\r\nat Hillah. This discovery was made quite independently of Dr. Hincks;\r\nand Layard is inclined to think that, in actual date, the precedence is\r\ndue to Rawlinson.[789] He was able already (1847) to announce that he\r\nhad ‘obtained a tolerably extensive alphabet from the orthography of the\r\nproper names’; but he adds: ‘I have left the grammar and construction of\r\nthe language hitherto untouched.’ He had, however, been greatly struck\r\nby the number of signs with apparently equivalent sounds.[790] He found\r\nit difficult to admit the existence of variants in the same inscription,\r\nexcept such as were caused by slight changes in the writing of the same\r\ncharacter. He saw, however, that no such explanation would cover all the\r\ndifficulties of the case, for some of the substitutes were obviously\r\ntotally distinct in form. In this case he did not believe that they were\r\n‘legitimately interchangeable.’ He thought the ‘phonetic organisation\r\nof the language was so minute and elaborate that although each form was\r\ndesigned to represent a distinct and specific sound, yet the artist\r\nwas perpetually liable to confound the characters.’ He suggested also\r\nthat each consonant had a different sign to express the surd and\r\nsonant; and in some cases one might be substituted for the other. The\r\n‘vowel-sounds,’ he declared, ‘were inherent’; but it was allowable also\r\nto represent them by separate signs; and farther redundant consonants\r\nwere frequently introduced for the sake of euphony. These opinions were\r\nimmediately traversed by Löwenstern, in his ‘Exposé des Eléments’ (1847).\r\nThis tract followed the sudden, though happily transient, conversion of\r\nHincks to the application of the Semitic vowel system to the Babylonian\r\nwriting. Löwenstern embraced this view with characteristic energy; and it\r\nwas adopted also by De Saulcy, in whose case it became one of the chief\r\ncauses of the ultimate failure of his Assyrian studies.\r\n\r\nLöwenstern, as we have said, considered that Rawlinson was fundamentally\r\nwrong in applying the laws derived from Indo-European languages ‘to a\r\nwriting and a language that are Semitic.’ He absolutely denied that the\r\nvowel is inherent.[791] The signs are simple consonants, and they may\r\nbe used in connection with any vowel sound. The vowels may or may not\r\nbe expressed, and the signs for them are to a large extent expressive\r\nof any vowel sound. One sign he mentions may convey the sound of _hou_,\r\n_a_, and _ya_; another of _a_ or _ha_, _w_ and _ü_.[792] The vowels are,\r\nhe says, by no means limited to the _a_, _i_ and _u_ of the Sanscrit,\r\nbut include also the _e_ and _o_ and the diphthong _ao_. He entirely\r\ndisagrees with the opinion of Rawlinson that the equivalent signs have\r\nany modified value. He compares Assyrian with Egyptian, and regards the\r\nsigns that are apparently interchangeable as simple ‘homophones.’ He\r\nshows the different ways in which the names of the Achaemenian kings are\r\nwritten; and draws the apparently inevitable inference that the different\r\nsigns have one and the same sound. ‘The variants,’ he says, ‘may be used\r\nindifferently without violating the phonetic laws of the language.’[793]\r\nHe was apparently the first to observe that some signs ‘express different\r\nsounds’; and these he calls ‘homotypes.’[794] As was natural, he does\r\nnot appear to have had any idea of the importance of this discovery. His\r\nhomotypes seem limited to the signs for vowels, any one of which may\r\nexpress almost any vowel sound, and also aspirates and liquids; and he\r\nobserved that _m_ and _w_, and _y_ and _i_, are each expressed by the\r\nsame signs.\r\n\r\nHis present pamphlet indicates how rapidly the study was progressing. He\r\nnow relies entirely upon the analysis of proper names, in accordance with\r\nthe suggestion of Longpérier; and he abandons his attempted comparison\r\nwith the form of the Hebrew letters. He surrenders his reading of\r\n‘Ashdod,’ and suggests ‘No Kaschzar’ in place of it; and he even doubts\r\nthe identity of Arsak and Sargon. He thinks he has discovered from the\r\nNaksh-i-Rustam inscription that the sign he mistook for _r_ is really\r\n_s_, and that his _k_ is certainly _n_. Accordingly he reads the word _s_\r\n_ch(kh)_ _n_ which somewhat revives his confidence in Sargon.\r\n\r\nIt is not clear to what extent, if to any, he was indebted to Hincks. His\r\nexaggerated Semitism was probably of native growth. He was not yet aware\r\nof the age of the Babylonian bricks, as explained by Hincks in 1846:\r\nyet he knew the determinative sign for proper names, which apparently\r\nwas not known to Hincks.[795] Hincks, on the other hand, recognised a\r\nsign ‘prefixed non-phonetically to the name Ormuzd, and also used by\r\nabbreviation for the word “god.”’ Löwenstern says there is ‘no special\r\nsign accompanying the names of the gods.’ He, however, recognised a\r\nsign as the monogram for ‘god’; but when he found it in conjunction with\r\nthe name of ‘Aurmuzd’ he treated it as the initial letter, and gave it\r\nthe definite phonetic value of _a_.[796] Such were the difficulties\r\nto be overcome before the determinative for ‘god’ was recognised. He\r\nobserved that a word may be expressed by its first and last signs, an\r\nearly indication of the phonetic complement.[797] Meanwhile Hincks and\r\nRawlinson announced the discovery already mentioned that the apparent\r\nequivalent signs in Persian depended in reality upon the vowel that was\r\nassociated with the consonantal value. It at once occurred to Longpérier\r\nthat the great difficulty of the Assyrian homophones might be solved by\r\nthe application of the same principle. If, he says, there is a separate\r\nsign for the consonant _m_ according as it is followed by _a_, _i_ or\r\n_u_, ‘one can understand how a similar practice, if extended to many\r\nconsonants, would augment the number of alphabetical signs.’ He warned\r\nscholars not to be too ready to accept the existence of homophones,\r\nbecause he observed that ‘according as the work proceeds the number of\r\nhomophones decreases.’[798]\r\n\r\nWhile these discussions were proceeding, Botta continued his\r\ncontributions to the ‘Journal Asiatique’ (1847-8), and afterwards\r\npublished them in a separate ‘Mémoire sur l’Ecriture cunéiforme’\r\n(Paris, 1848). He endeavoured to introduce some degree of order among\r\nthe profusion of Assyrian signs. He drew up a Table, consisting of a\r\nhundred and twenty-five signs that seemed to be most commonly used; and\r\nunder each of these he arranged the signs which he found were sometimes\r\napparently interchanged for them.[799] In this List of Variants we\r\nconstantly find six or seven signs—sometimes many more—grouped together\r\nas of equivalent value. In view of later discoveries, it will be seen how\r\nextremely useful this classification might become, for the signs thus\r\nbrought together were no doubt usually those that contained the same\r\nconsonantal values. In the meantime, however, Botta was at a loss to find\r\nany reasonable explanation. Like Rawlinson, however, he could not believe\r\nthat any of them were, as Löwenstern maintained, real homophones, or\r\nsigns having identical values. They must, he thought, be distinguished\r\nfrom each other by some slight shades of sound that were sufficiently\r\nnear to be easily confounded.[800] He explained, in anticipation of\r\nthe discovery so soon afterwards made by Hincks, that ‘it is possible\r\nthat the language is syllabic—so far, at least, as that each consonant\r\nis represented by a different sign, according to the vowel to which it\r\nis joined. Thus, for example, there would be one sign for _b_; others\r\nfor _ba_, _bi_, etc. In Semitic languages the short vowels have little\r\nimportance, and therefore the syllable _ba_ might be expressed by the\r\nsign for _b_ only; by the two signs _b_ and _a_; and also in certain\r\ncases, by the signs that represent _b_ in connection with the other\r\nvowels.’ It will be seen that Botta was very far indeed from being the\r\nmere painstaking classifier which it was once the fashion to describe\r\nhim. He and Longpérier were, in fact, the only two Continental scholars,\r\nat present occupied with this subject, who were gifted with any real\r\npenetration into its difficulties.\r\n\r\nBotta succeeded in dividing nearly the whole of the Bull inscription\r\ncorrectly into its words, but the difficulty of this task was still\r\nso great that even he occasionally fell into error. He also first\r\npointed out that the sign Löwenstern mistook for two signs was one and\r\nindivisible. He detected the determinative sign for ‘country’ that is\r\nused in the Khorsabad inscription, and he made the important suggestion\r\nthat the phonetic value of the sign for ‘king’ is ‘sar.’[801] Longpérier\r\nat once connected this word with its Hebrew equivalent, and showed that\r\nit is used to express the first syllable in the name of the Khorsabad\r\nking ‘Sar-gin.’ He made an attempt to decipher an inscription on the leg\r\nof the Khorsabad bull, and he was the first to recognise ‘Assur.’ His\r\ntranslation runs thus: ‘Glorious [is] Sargon, King, great King, King of\r\nKings, King of the country of Assur.’[802] He also showed that ‘great’\r\nmight be expressed by one sign only,[803] which added another step to\r\nthe discovery of the phonetic complement begun by Löwenstern. This\r\nshort contribution to the ‘Revue Archéologique’ shows that Longpérier\r\npossessed to a high degree a true aptitude for these studies; and if\r\nhe had been able to pursue them, he might have vindicated for France\r\na more favourable position than it was her fortune to obtain. The\r\ndifficulty in these matters of recognising truth from error was nowhere\r\nmore clearly illustrated than in the case of the identification of\r\n‘Sargon’ by Longpérier. So far was the correctness of this ingenious\r\nsuggestion from gaining immediate acceptance, that we find Hincks\r\nsubsequently conjectures that the name of the father of Sennacherib\r\nshould be read ‘Ni-Shar.’[804] A later attempt, in 1849, which resulted\r\nin ‘Kin-nil-li-n’a’ showed little improvement. Even in 1850 Rawlinson\r\nis still so far afield that he translates it ‘Arko-tsin’; and it is\r\nnot till August 1851 that he accepts ‘Sargina,’ the reading given four\r\nyears previously by Longpérier.[805] Yet the question was of no little\r\ninterest, for it really settled the controversy between Hincks and\r\nRawlinson as to the date of the Lower Assyrian dynasty in favour of the\r\nformer. It was not till Rawlinson read ‘Sennacherib’ in a tablet found\r\nby Layard at Kouyunjik that he would acknowledge his error, and admit\r\nthat there was at last found ‘a tangible starting place for chronology.’\r\nHincks was satisfied, two years earlier, that he had identified the names\r\nof Sennacherib and Esarhaddon.\r\n\r\nIn June 1849 Hincks read a paper on the Khorsabad inscriptions which\r\nshows a great advance upon any contribution yet made to the decipherment\r\nof the language. There is evidence in his essay on the Van inscriptions\r\nthat so early as December 1847 he had practically given up the attempt he\r\nmade in the previous January to assimilate the Assyrian writing as far as\r\npossible to the Hebrew—at least as regards the vowel system.[806] He is\r\nnow satisfied that the Assyrian maintains a clear distinction between the\r\nvowels, and also between the surd and sonant consonants at the beginning\r\nof a word, though at the end the two sounds were confounded. He points\r\nout that no distinction is made between the sounds of _w_ and _m_, and,\r\nhe adds, between _l_ and _r_; but he afterwards correctly admits the\r\nindependent existence of these sounds in his Syllabarium.[807] He has\r\nalso definitely arrived at the conviction that the Assyrian characters\r\nare wholly syllabic or ideographic—in a large number of cases they\r\nare both. He will not now admit that any of them represents a simple\r\nconsonant. He has still no doubt that there are many homophones. Many\r\ncharacters appear to have precisely the same values, ‘though much fewer\r\nthan might be inferred from a mechanical comparison of inscriptions and\r\nobservance of interchanges.’ He recognises the existence of polyphones,\r\nalready described by Löwenstern in 1847 as ‘homotypes.’\r\n\r\n‘Many characters,’ he says, ‘admit of two or more kindred values, the\r\ndistinction between which would appear not to have been considered so\r\ngreat as to require different modes of representing them.’ This discovery\r\nwas so perplexing that he doubted how best to present it to the reader:\r\n‘Whether it is more desirable to give different values to the same\r\ncharacter, or to give it one value only, with a warning to the reader\r\nthat he may, under certain restrictions, substitute another for it at his\r\npleasure.’\r\n\r\nBut the chief importance of his present essay consists in the light it\r\nthrows for the first time on the nature of the ideograms. The earliest\r\ninquirers leant to the opinion that the language was at least partly\r\nmonogrammatic, though Grotefend was inclined to regard these signs more\r\nin the light of abbreviations. He, however, distinctly pointed out the\r\nexistence of ideographic characters in the shorter inscriptions at\r\nPersepolis. In 1846 (December) Hincks recognised a sign that was used ‘by\r\nabbreviation for the word “god”’; and he noticed that ‘besides having\r\na phonetic value, it is used as a non-phonetic initial before the name\r\nof Ormuzd.’ In the same essay he gave numerous other instances of the\r\nexistence of ideographic and non-phonetic determinative signs.[808] In\r\n1849 he added for the first time the true phonetic value (_an_) for the\r\nsign for ‘god’;[809] and in the present essay he shows the various uses\r\nto which ideographic signs may be applied. He explains that many phonetic\r\ncharacters also express words; these may be considered as abbreviations,\r\nthough possibly some ‘originally denoted ideas and thence, in process\r\nof time, the initial sounds in the words which express them.’ A second\r\nclass resemble the mixed signs of the Egyptians: they may represent words\r\nby themselves, but they sometimes require the addition of complements.\r\nAnother class never have complements, nor any phonetic value except\r\nin compound nouns, of which the word they represent forms an integral\r\npart. The ideograms, however, that give rise to the most interesting\r\nspeculation are those that have phonetic values, but where the words\r\nthat denote the ideas they express have no phonetic relationship to\r\nthe phonetic value of the ideogram. For example, we now know that the\r\nphonetic value of the ideogram for ‘god’ is _an_; but this syllable\r\nforms no portion of the Assyrian word for ‘god,’ which is _il-u_. A\r\nglance over any table giving the syllabic values of ideograms will show\r\nhow extensively this peculiarity prevails; and its recognition soon led\r\nHincks to the important deduction that the writing was borrowed from some\r\nother people where the phonetic value of the ideograms was in some sort\r\nof agreement with the initial sound of the word they represented.[810]\r\nHincks dwelt on the great difficulty of deciphering a language in which\r\nthe characters are sometimes used as phonetic syllables and sometimes\r\nas ideographs. In each case it was necessary first to determine in\r\nwhich sense it occurred, and, if in the latter, the pronunciation could\r\nonly be ascertained when it was found spelt out phonetically in some\r\nknown word. For example, the pronunciation of the ideogram for ‘god’\r\nwas fixed by finding that it formed the _il-u_ in ‘Bab-ilu.’ When the\r\npronunciation of the ideogram was known, it afforded, as has been said,\r\nin the majority of cases no clue whatever to the syllabic value of the\r\nsign, and the transliterator was liable to fall into the error of reading\r\na word ideographically instead of phonetically, just as frequently as\r\nto mistake ideograms for phonetics. Compound ideograms were also not\r\ninfrequent, where two or more were used to express an idea, but without\r\nreference to the sound. For example, the word for ‘palace’ is composed\r\nof two ideograms, _bit_ and _rab_, meaning respectively ‘house’ and\r\n‘great’; but Hincks warned the reader that he might fall into a serious\r\nerror if he were to suppose that they are employed in conjunction\r\nphonetically, and that ‘bitrab’ is the pronunciation of the Assyrian word\r\nfor ‘palace.’[811] He shows that several ideographs may be used as simple\r\ndeterminative suffixes to words which are phonetically complete without\r\nthem. The determinatives probably all originally represented words, and\r\nmany of them preserved their phonetic values.[812]\r\n\r\nThis inquiry into the nature and use of ideograms was the first that\r\nhad been made, and it formed an important contribution to the knowledge\r\nof the language. His attempted transliterations are not of equal value.\r\nHe rejected the reading of ‘Sargon’ given by Löwenstern, and he does\r\nnot seem to have heard of the solution of the difficulty proposed the\r\nyear before by Longpérier.[813] He recognised indeed that the sign for\r\n‘king’ with which the word begins forms an integral portion of the name,\r\nbut he did not perceive, like Longpérier, that its counterpart is the\r\nHebrew ‘sar’; and he was led by other comparisons to assign the value\r\nof ‘kin-nil’ to the ideogram. He knew also that the sign Löwenstern\r\nhad broken up into two and thought signified _r_, _s_ formed in fact a\r\nsingle sign, which he pronounced _ri_ or _li_. These efforts resulted in\r\n‘kin-nil-li-n’a,’ which might seem even less manageable than the _r_,\r\n_s_, _k_ of Löwenstern. But Hincks was quite equal to the occasion, and,\r\nwith the customary imaginative faculty of the philologist, he found no\r\ndifficulty in connecting this person with the Chinzirus of Ptolemy,\r\nwho, it appears, was a contemporary of Porus. He had already detected\r\nthat the names of the son and grandson of this prince were Sennacherib\r\nand Esarhaddon, the builders of Kouyunjik and the South-West Palace of\r\nNimrud. The first we find he transliterated ‘Sanki’ or ‘Sankin,’ with the\r\npossible addition of ‘rav’ or ‘ram’—‘Sankin-rav’: the other came out as\r\n‘Adar-ka-dan.’ He also explains how he arrived at ‘Nabiccudurrayuchur’\r\nfor Nebuchadnezzar, and how he fancied he had found ‘Jerusalem’; but\r\nthese instances only serve to illustrate the great obstacles that had\r\nstill to be overcome. We have already mentioned the suggestions that\r\nwere made first by Longpérier and afterwards by Botta with the view of\r\nreducing the number of homophones. Hincks confesses he had not seen the\r\nessay of the former, and we have not observed that he has acknowledged\r\nhis obligations to Botta, though he was evidently acquainted with his\r\nwork, as we see from an unpleasant reference to ‘a mechanical comparison\r\nof inscriptions.’ It was, however, upon the principle these writers\r\nsuggested that Hincks was now about to solve one of the greatest\r\ndifficulties of the language. The solution is contained in an Appendix\r\nto the essay just reviewed, and was sent to press on January 19, 1850,\r\nthe same day that Major Rawlinson read his first paper to the Asiatic\r\nSociety. Hincks now explains that there are four distinct vowel sounds in\r\nAssyrian, _ā_, _a_, _i_ and _u_; but the difference between the first two\r\nwas not maintained when they preceded a consonant.[814] He laid down that\r\nevery sign represented a consonant either preceded or followed by one of\r\nthese vowels. Therefore, each consonant was represented by seven signs,\r\nthus: _cā_, _ca_, _ci_, _cu_; _ac_, _ic_, _uc_. He thought there were at\r\nleast fifteen consonants, and that the syllabary was of Indo-European\r\norigin, and need not therefore, as he had at first supposed, be adjusted\r\nto the Hebrew alphabet. The principle thus announced has been accepted\r\nwith some modifications. The difference between the long and short\r\n_a_ has not been maintained in this connection, and consequently the\r\nsyllabic representation of each consonant is reduced from seven to six.\r\nHis statement that the difference between surd and sonant is maintained\r\nat the beginning but not at the end of the syllable has also been\r\nadmitted. We have thus separate signs for _ba_, _bi_, _bu_ and _pa_,\r\n_pi_, _pu_; but the signs for _ap_, _ip_ and _up_ answer for both.\r\nHincks’s consonants have been accepted without material change. His\r\n_y_ has been omitted and _h_ added; _z_ has been substituted for _j_.\r\nTwo signs for _k_ to represent _Caph_ and _Koph_, and two for _t_ to\r\nrepresent _Teth_ and _Tau_ have been added, where Hincks only had one for\r\neach, so that the number of consonants is now raised to seventeen. Not\r\nonly did Hincks arrive at a correct theory of the simple syllables, but\r\nhe identified correctly a very large number of the signs corresponding\r\nto them. Of the seventy-one he gives in his Table at least fifty-seven\r\nare accurate, and possibly even more. He closed the essay with a brief\r\nspecimen of a translation from the Khorsabad inscription.\r\n\r\nThis Essay of Hincks exercised a decisive influence upon the future\r\nstudy of Assyrian. It demonstrated that, although the language was\r\nSemitic, the mode of writing was not Semitic; and for a time it divided\r\nscholars into two opposing camps. Those who followed Hincks maintained\r\nthat the language was syllabic, and that each sign expressed a consonant\r\nassociated with an inherent and invariable vowel. Those, on the contrary,\r\nwho sought to assimilate it to the Hebrew system were of opinion that\r\nthe signs represent simple consonants that might be preceded or followed\r\nby any vowel. We have noted the gradual recognition of the syllabic\r\nnature of the Assyrian writing. The earliest opinion was that the signs\r\nwere both syllabic and alphabetical, and we have seen that Grotefend\r\nin his transliteration treated them in this manner. Hincks in his\r\nfirst Essay followed the same method, but he found the vast majority\r\nof the signs were syllabic, and his Table shows only four that are\r\npurely alphabetical. Then came the discovery that the language itself\r\nwas Semitic, and the inference naturally followed that the writing was\r\nso likewise. Under the influence of this conviction, Hincks drew up\r\nhis Second Table, showing only the consonantal value of the signs, and\r\nleaving them to be associated indifferently with the vowel sounds. But\r\nhe remained in this opinion for a comparatively short time, and in the\r\nend of the same year he had reverted to his original view. The effect\r\nof the present essay was to establish the absolute syllabism of the\r\nlanguage; and in a paper read shortly afterwards before the British\r\nAssociation ‘On the Language and Mode of Writing of Assyria’ (August\r\n1850), he ‘maintained, in opposition to all other writers, that the\r\ncharacters had all definite syllabic values, there being no consonants,\r\nand consequently no necessity or liberty of supplying vowels.’ In this\r\nopinion he then stood alone. Rawlinson, in reply, expressed his belief\r\nthat the signs had a syllabic origin, but that they were ‘subsequently\r\nused to express a mere portion of a syllable.’ ‘He could,’ he says,\r\n‘adduce numerous instances where the cuneiform signs were used as _bona\r\nfide_ letters.’[815]\r\n\r\nIn France, the opinion Hincks expounded in his second essay took\r\nimmediate root. The logical instincts of the French mind clung with\r\ndesperate tenacity to the conviction that a Semitic language could only\r\nbe expressed by a Semitic mode of writing. Löwenstern at first (1845)\r\nthought that the signs represented some sort of mechanical union of\r\nconsonant and vowel: that is to say, that there was a fixed portion of\r\nthe sign to represent the consonantal sound, and a variable portion to\r\nindicate the conjunction of the vowel. ‘The signs,’ he said, ‘reproduce\r\nin part the same forms differently combined, which suggests a syllabic\r\nunion in many of the signs.’ But he subsequently became the most\r\nthorough-going champion of the alphabetical theory. Botta only just\r\nfound it ‘possible to conceive that the language was syllabic,’ yet he\r\nfollowed Longpérier in the luminous suggestion already described.[816]\r\nEven De Saulcy was haunted by dim fears that, after all, Assyrian might\r\nturn out to be syllabic, and the consistency with which he adhered to\r\nthe opposite or Semitic mode of writing rendered his subsequent studies\r\nalmost valueless. Rawlinson, as we shall soon see, yielded in time, and\r\nhis transliteration of the Behistun inscription shows small traces of his\r\nearly heresy, which he was still ready to defend in August 1850.\r\n\r\nSuch was the progress already made in decipherment when Rawlinson at\r\nlength gave to the world some of the results of his labours in the same\r\nfield. It will be remembered that in the autumn of 1847 he succeeded in\r\ntaking a copy of the third column of the Behistun inscription. Whatever\r\nleisure he could command during the year 1848 and the early part of 1849\r\nhe devoted to its study; and when he returned to England in the autumn\r\nof that year, he brought the translation home with him. The work of\r\npublication was one of great difficulty, in consequence of the multitude\r\nof strange characters in many languages that had to be reproduced and\r\ncorrected; and although Rawlinson remained in England till 1851, he was\r\nobliged to leave before it was accomplished. Some Continental writers\r\nchose to make this delay a matter of complaint against Rawlinson, whom\r\nthey accused of deliberately withholding his copies for personal and\r\nselfish motives. It would be difficult, however, to mention anyone who\r\nwas at that time at all likely to profit by their possession. The special\r\nqualifications of a decipherer are by no means common, and M. de Saulcy\r\nat least gave decisive proof that he did not possess them. M. Oppert, on\r\nthe other hand, was still absorbed in the Persian and Median versions.\r\nBut these gentlemen, and those who then shared their feelings, write as\r\nthough Major Rawlinson had appropriated the rock of Behistun as well as\r\nthe copy of the inscription that covered it.[817] They seem to forget\r\nthat if they were prepared to undergo the same sacrifice and overcome\r\nthe same difficulties, they could in a few weeks procure copies for\r\nthemselves. What would have been more natural than to give the commission\r\nto M. Flandin, whose enterprise in such matters had already been so\r\nconspicuously illustrated? Nothing, however, could be farther from\r\ntheir intentions. They had no notion of foregoing the luxury of feeling\r\naggrieved with the English soldier whose energy, like his genius, so far\r\nout-soared their own. Rawlinson was, we submit, fully justified in the\r\ncourse he adopted. He had obtained his copy at great personal sacrifice;\r\nno one in Europe was so qualified to accomplish the task of decipherment\r\nas himself, and the eighteen months he devoted to the task was not\r\nexcessive. The subsequent delay in publication was incident to the nature\r\nof the work itself, for which he was not responsible.\r\n\r\nHe, however, lost no time in placing the general results at which he had\r\narrived before the public. On January 19 and February 16, 1850, he read\r\npapers before the Asiatic Society ‘On the Inscriptions of Assyria and\r\nBabylon,’ and these, with a few additional notes, were published in March\r\nof that year.\r\n\r\nHe tells us he had found more than eighty proper names in the trilingual\r\ninscriptions, including those in the Behistun; and ‘by a careful\r\ncomparison of the duplicate forms of writing’ them in the Persian and\r\nBabylonian columns he had been able, by means of the former, which were\r\nknown, to determine the values of about a hundred Babylonian characters.\r\nThe next step was by a collation of the inscriptions to ascertain ‘the\r\nhomophones of each known alphabetical power.’ By this means he ‘added\r\nnearly fifty characters to those previously known through the Persian\r\nkey.’ He confessed that his knowledge of the Babylonian characters was\r\nat present limited to these one hundred and fifty characters.[818] From\r\nthe direction of his studies we may infer that these signs were chiefly\r\ntaken from the trilingual inscriptions; and in that case they would be\r\npractically exhaustive; but they would amount to less than one half\r\nof those in general use in the Assyrian text.[819] The same process\r\nof comparison with the Persian translation enabled him to draw up ‘a\r\nlist of about two hundred Babylonian words of which we know the sound\r\napproximately and the meaning certainly.’ But in addition to these, he\r\nwas able, by ‘an extensive comparison of similar or cognate phrases, to\r\nadd about two hundred meanings certainly, and a hundred more, probably,\r\nto the vocabulary already obtained through the Babylonian translation.’\r\nHe was thus acquainted with the meaning of about five hundred out of a\r\nvocabulary which he estimated as containing five thousand words.[820]\r\nThese words, he explains, ‘are almost all found either in their full\r\nintegrity or subjected to some slight modification in Assyrian’; and\r\nthey enabled him ‘to arrive at a pretty correct notion of the general\r\npurport of the phrases in which they occur.’ Although his vocabulary was\r\nstill limited to one-tenth of the vocabulary, it embraced ‘all the most\r\nimportant terms in the language’; and he found it sufficient for the\r\ninterpretation of the historical inscriptions.\r\n\r\nThe present Memoir was intended simply as introductory to the subject,\r\nand he did not give a list of the one hundred and fifty signs with their\r\nvalues attached. We cannot, therefore, institute a comparison as yet with\r\nthe Syllabarium already drawn up by Hincks. It is sufficiently clear,\r\nhowever, that he had not, at the time of writing the Memoir, realised\r\nthe essentially syllabic character of the language. There are, he says,\r\n‘cases where a single alphabetical power appertains to the sign,’ and, he\r\nadds, ‘it cannot certainly be maintained that the phonetic portion of the\r\nalphabet is altogether syllabic.’ ‘There is,’ he observes, ‘an extensive\r\nsyllabarium; but at the same time many of the characters can only be\r\nexplained as single consonants.’ There is no indication that he had as\r\nyet apprehended the principle that governs the combination of consonant\r\nand vowel, as recently expounded by Hincks, and which is interwoven\r\nwith the whole structure of the language. Indeed he says distinctly:\r\n‘I have neither adopted, nor do I conceive it possible to adopt, any\r\nsystem with regard to the employment of the vowels in Assyrian and\r\nBabylonian.’ In some other respects also he was still behind the great\r\nIrish scholar. Hincks, for example, had laid down that the distinction\r\nbetween the consonantal sounds is uniformly maintained; and the truth of\r\nthis statement has been since confirmed. Rawlinson was, however, still\r\nof opinion that ‘the gutturals and sibilants everywhere interchange.’\r\n‘There is the greatest possible difficulty in distinguishing between _k_,\r\n_d_, and _t_. _L_ and _v_ interchange.’ It is evident also that he had\r\nstill much to learn from his rival on the subject of the ideograms. It\r\nmay be doubted indeed how far he had as yet apprehended the important\r\nplace they occupy. ‘The names of the gods,’ he says, ‘are represented by\r\nsigns which appear in some cases to be arbitrary monograms, but which\r\nare more generally either the dominant sound of the name or its initial\r\nphonetic power.’ He thought, for example, that the monogram for Bel was\r\nsimply the letter ‘B,’ an idea that is wholly unfounded. He is of course\r\naware that there are many other ideograms besides those used for the\r\ngods, but he gives them no sort of prominence. He, however, attributes an\r\nideographic origin to the syllables. ‘When a sign represents a syllable,’\r\nmeaning apparently a compound syllable, ‘I conjecture that the syllable\r\nin question may have been the specific name of the object which the sign\r\nwas supposed to depict; whilst in cases where a single alphabetical\r\npower appertains to the sign it would seem as if that power had been\r\nthe dominant sound in the name of the object.’ But this is a purely\r\nacademical question. The important point lay in precisely the opposite\r\ndirection, and attention had been already called to it by Hincks. The\r\npeculiarity most necessary to emphasise is that in a vast majority of\r\ncases the pronunciation of the ideogram has no relation whatever to the\r\nname of the object it represents, nor, when it has a syllabic power,\r\nto the phonetic value of the syllable. Rawlinson, however, did good\r\nservice in the present Memoir by laying down the first rudiments of\r\nthe grammar, a branch of the subject that Hincks subsequently did much\r\nto elucidate; and he was also the first to bring into prominence the\r\npolyphonic character of the language. Hincks had indeed remarked that\r\n‘many characters admit of two or more kindred values’; but Rawlinson\r\nfarther shows that ‘certain characters represent two entirely dissimilar\r\nsounds—sounds so dissimilar that they cannot be brought into relation\r\nwith each other.’ He gives as an example the sign for the vowel _a_,\r\nwhich also conveys the sound of ‘bar.’\r\n\r\nBut the great distinction of Rawlinson lay in his unequalled power of\r\ntranslation. Large numbers of Assyrian inscriptions were now before\r\nthe world. The ‘Monument de Khorsabad’ had appeared in 1848; Layard’s\r\ncollection followed in 1849, and included the inscription on the Black\r\nObelisk found in 1846. So far only a few words had been made out with\r\nmore or less of accuracy; but nothing had yet been done in the way of\r\na connected translation. The few lines of the Khorsabad inscription\r\nwhich Hincks attempted in the Addenda to his paper (Feb. 26, 1850) had\r\nnot as yet appeared.[821] Rawlinson, however, observed that many of the\r\ncommon expressions used at Behistun were adopted almost verbatim from\r\nthe Assyrian annals; and it was the discovery of these known passages in\r\nthe Assyrian inscriptions that first encouraged him to undertake their\r\ntranslation. He disclaimed all pretensions to be ‘a complete master\r\nof the Assyrian language’; and he still speaks of it as to a great\r\nextent unintelligible. ‘The first outwork,’ he says, ‘has been carried\r\nin a hitherto impregnable position, and that is all’ Indeed he is so\r\ndiscouraged by the difficulty of the task that he is sometimes disposed\r\n‘to abandon the study altogether in utter despair of arriving at any\r\nsatisfactory result.’ In consequence of the profusion of ideograms\r\nin proper names, he finds that their ‘pronunciation is a matter of\r\nexceeding difficulty, nay, as I think, of absolute impossibility’;\r\nand it was in this department that he achieved the least success. He,\r\nhowever, passes in review many of the principal inscriptions that were\r\nthen known, and analyses the contents of each.[822] He begins with the\r\nearliest in date, the one taken from the North West Palace at Nineveh,\r\nwhich he ascribes to King Assur-adan-pal—really Assur-natsir-pal. He\r\npasses on to the inscription of his successor, whom he calls Temenbar\r\nII. (really Salmaneser II.), which covers the Black Obelisk, and it is\r\nto it that he devotes the largest share of attention.[823] His analysis,\r\npartly a verbal translation and partly a summary, fills no less than\r\nseventeen pages, and the achievement cannot fail to elicit unqualified\r\nadmiration. The unfortunate failure to identify a large proportion of\r\nthe proper names gives to it an unreal appearance that no doubt strikes\r\nthe modern student unfavourably and may at first lead him to exaggerate\r\nits deficiencies. If, however, he is careful to remember that it is the\r\nfirst attempt of the kind ever made, his feelings will soon turn to\r\nastonishment that so much should have been correctly made out of what had\r\nhitherto been absolutely unintelligible. He may profitably compare a few\r\npassages with a modern version. For example, Temenbar begins: ‘At the\r\ncommencement of my reign after that I was established on the throne I\r\nassembled the chiefs of my people and came down into the plains of Esmes,\r\nwhere I took the city of Haridu, the chief city belonging to Nakharmi.’\r\nA recent translation of the same passage runs: ‘At the beginning of my\r\nreign when on the throne of the kingdom I had seated myself in state,\r\nmy chariots and [my] armies I assembled. Into the depths of the land of\r\nSimesi I penetrated; Aridu the strong city of Ninni I captured.’ Again\r\nRawlinson translates: ‘I went out from the city of Nineveh and crossing\r\nthe Euphrates I attacked and defeated Ahuni, the son of Hateni, in the\r\ncity of Sitrat, which was situated upon the Euphrates, and which Ahuni\r\nhad made one of his capitals. Ahuni, the son of Hateni, with his gods and\r\nhis chief priests, his horses, his sons and his daughters and all his\r\nmen of war, I brought away to my country of Assyria.’ The modern version\r\nsays: ‘I departed from Nineveh; the Euphrates I crossed at its flood; I\r\nmarched against Akhuni, the son of Adini. The country of Shitamrat, a\r\nmountain peak on the banks of the Euphrates, he made his stronghold. The\r\npeak of the mountain I captured; Akhuni, with his gods, his chariots, his\r\nhorses, his sons, his daughters and his army, I carried away and to my\r\ncity of Assur I brought’;[824] and so on through the events of thirty-one\r\nyears of the reign of the great king. On the other hand, it would be too\r\nmuch to say that even the sense is always preserved. There are, in fact,\r\nmany and serious divergencies from the correct translation as it now\r\nstands, after more than forty years’ continuous study. It is impossible\r\nthat it could have been otherwise with the means then at hand. The\r\nwonder is that so much could have been accomplished with one hundred\r\nand fifty imperfectly understood characters; and with only five hundred\r\nwords arrived at conjecturally out of some six thousand. Rawlinson\r\nhimself warned the reader that here and there ‘little dependence can be\r\nplaced on the translation’; and he confesses that sometimes he could\r\nnot ‘conjecture even the meaning of several passages.’ Notwithstanding\r\nhis difficulty with the proper names, a host of new ones were now for\r\nthe first time identified: Amanus; the Hittites; Chaldæans; the rivers\r\nTigris, Euphrates, Belikh; the cities of Borsippa, Tyre, Sidon, Gabal,\r\nCaleh. On the other hand, the Akkadians now make their first appearance\r\nin modern history as ‘Hekdi,’ ‘which may be connected with the Armenian\r\n“Haik.”’ Hazael of Damascus is still concealed as ‘Khazakan of Atesh’ and\r\n‘Jehu the son of Omri’ appears as ‘Yahua the son of Hubiri,’ ‘a prince,’\r\nsays the translator, ‘of whose native country I am ignorant.’ He called\r\nattention to the name of Yehuda in a Khorsabad inscription in connection\r\nwith that of Hamath; but he hesitated to identify it with Judah. Indeed\r\nat this period he could not bring himself to believe that the son of\r\nthe Khorsabad king was Sennacherib and his grandson Esarhaddon, as\r\nHincks ventured to assert.[825] The signs for Sargon he transliterated\r\n‘Arko-tsin,’ and those for Sennacherib, ‘Bel — — Adonim-sha’; but\r\nEsarhaddon came out almost correct as ‘Assar-Adan.’ He concludes his\r\npaper by an analysis of the inscriptions found at Khorsabad, containing\r\nthe annals of ‘Arko-tsin.’\r\n\r\nIt was not till the following year, and till after Rawlinson’s return\r\nto Persia, that the publication of the third column of the Behistun\r\ninscription was completed. It fills the fourteenth volume of the\r\n‘Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ and the greater part of it was\r\nlaid on the table before May 1851.[826] A portion of the expense was\r\ndefrayed by a Government grant, made at the suggestion of Lord John\r\nRussell; and the volume consists of seventeen large plates containing\r\nthe cuneiform text with transliteration and a Latin translation. Then\r\ncomes an ‘Indiscriminate List of Babylonian and Assyrian Characters,’\r\nwith their phonetic powers, and also such ideographic values as\r\nhad been ascertained. The list includes two hundred and forty-six\r\nprincipal signs, many of which are followed by others varying in form;\r\nand generally representing the different methods of writing found at\r\nPersepolis, Babylon and Nineveh. An analysis of the text, extending over\r\na hundred pages, follows, but it has not been carried farther than to\r\nthe end of the first column. The ‘Memoir on the Babylonian and Assyrian\r\nInscriptions’ is even more incomplete. It covers only sixteen pages, and\r\nbreaks off in the middle of a sentence, before the analysis of the second\r\nsign was concluded. No explanation is given of this abrupt termination.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of a separate sign for each combination of vowel and\r\nconsonant, explained by Dr. Hincks in his Appendix of January 1850,\r\nno doubt exercised considerable influence on Rawlinson,[827] and we\r\nare now in a position to recognise the full effect it produced in the\r\nprogress of the study. How far Rawlinson independently divined the\r\nexistence of some such principle is by no means clear, but we have no\r\ndoubt that when he read his first paper to the Society he was still of\r\nopinion that the alphabetical system entered largely into the Assyrian\r\nlanguage. ‘Many of the characters,’ he then said, ‘can only be explained\r\nas single consonants.’[828] In accordance with this view, when he had\r\noccasion to refer to the Assyrian characters, he uniformly gives them\r\npurely alphabetical values, although in many cases their correct syllabic\r\nvalues had been already definitely fixed in Hincks’s Essay.[829] Hincks\r\nhimself pointed this out in one notable case. In 1850, Rawlinson said\r\nthat the suffix of the third person plural is a simple _n_; but soon\r\nafterwards Hincks showed that the consonantal termination is followed by\r\n_u_. This opinion Rawlinson adopted in 1851, and remarked of the word\r\n‘Yatipsu,’ ‘the termination in _u_ marks, of course, the plural number\r\nlike the Hebrew.’[830] ‘When,’ says Hincks, ‘the commentary was published\r\n[in 1850] no _u_ could be discovered. The sign he now reads _su_ was a\r\nsimple _s_.’[831] These facts are not sufficiently accounted for by the\r\nexplanation Rawlinson gives in his present Memoir. ‘In the articulation\r\n_kat_, for example, which is composed of two characters, _ka_ and _at_,\r\neither one or other of these signs must represent a simple letter rather\r\nthan a syllable; and as this peculiarity of expression pervades the\r\nwhole Assyrian alphabet, I think I am justified in still adhering to the\r\nstatement which I announced last year, that the phonetic signs were in\r\nsome cases syllabic and in others literal.’[832] However this may be,\r\nhe now finally abandons the description of the signs as letters, and no\r\nsimple alphabetical values are to be found in his ‘Indiscriminate List.’\r\nThere can be little doubt that the alteration in the method of writing is\r\nto be best explained by a corresponding change of opinion.[833] However\r\ngreat may have been his obligation to Hincks, he soon made the discovery\r\nhis own. He corrects the errors and supplies the deficiencies of his\r\npredecessor. He suppresses the twofold signs for _a_, and limits the\r\nregular syllabic combinations to the three vowels _a_, _i_ and _u_, which\r\nthus yielded six instead of seven values for each of the consonants.\r\nFollowing Hincks, he accepts only fifteen distinct consonantal values,\r\nbut he prefers to use _z_ and _kh_ in place of the _j_ and _g_ of Hincks,\r\nnow written _z_ and _ḫ_. With these he has given one hundred and seven\r\nsimple syllabic combinations, a much larger number than really exists;\r\nbut he has no less than seventy-eight correct, out of a possible number\r\nthat slightly exceeds eighty.[834] He, however, took no account of the\r\nsigns that indicated the exceptional combinations with the vowel _e_,\r\nwhich amount to about a dozen. This defect was soon afterwards noticed\r\nby Hincks, who, however, signally failed in his attempt to identify\r\nthem. On the other hand, we are now introduced for the first time to the\r\ncompound syllables that form so large a portion of the Babylonian signs.\r\nThese, unlike the simple syllables so successfully treated by Hincks,\r\nconsist of two consonants separated by a vowel. It is true that a few\r\nmade their appearance in Hincks’s short translation from the Khorsabad\r\ninscription (February 1850), such as ‘sib,’ ‘kun,’ ‘bul’ and ‘gur,’ along\r\nwith three others that are incorrect.[835] We also learn from a later\r\npublication that before the appearance of Rawlinson’s Syllabarium Hincks\r\nknew the values of upwards of twenty other compound syllabic signs.[836]\r\nBut they do not seem to have been made known to the world, and they all,\r\nwith the exception of five, are now met in the Syllabarium for the first\r\ntime. Rawlinson gives sixty-eight of these syllables, and no less than\r\nfifty are correct. He has been unable to give any phonetic value to sixty\r\nout of his two hundred and forty-six principal signs, but in several\r\ncases he has determined their ideographic meaning. The distribution of\r\nthe signs, as explained by Hincks, considerably diminished the number of\r\nsupposed homophones, and the compound syllables now enumerated tended\r\nin the same direction. But Rawlinson dwells with increasing bitterness\r\non the extreme confusion introduced into the language by polyphones.\r\nHe complains that ‘after years of laborious research he has overcome\r\nthe difficulty to but a limited extent.’ ‘The meaning of a word,’ he\r\nsays, ‘may be ascertained from the trilingual inscriptions, or from its\r\noccurring in a variety of passages with only one possible signification;\r\nbut unless its correspondent can be recognised in some Semitic tongue\r\nit is often impossible, owing to the employment in it of a polyphone\r\ncharacter to fix its orthography; and this uncertainty presses on the\r\nstudent with almost crushing severity.’[837] In addition to this, he had\r\nto contend with the difficulty that besets all early decipherers—the\r\ninability to distinguish between his own correct and incorrect values,\r\nwhere the latter often cause more confusion than if the sound were\r\nstill regarded as doubtful. Notwithstanding all these obstacles, his\r\ntransliteration was sufficient to afford a considerable knowledge of\r\nthe nature of the language; and to enable the student to recognise the\r\nconnection of the words that resulted with their Semitic relatives. In\r\nthe forty years that elapsed between the version we are now considering,\r\nand that given by Dr. Bezold, a whole army of scholars has been\r\nceaselessly at work upon the Babylonian and Assyrian inscriptions, and\r\nthe point they have reached is naturally far in advance of that in which\r\nit was placed by the first Essay of Rawlinson. The comparison of a few\r\npassages, taken almost at random, will enable the reader to appreciate\r\nthe position the study had reached in 1851.[838] The first lines of the\r\ninscription are rendered thus by Rawlinson, De Saulcy and Bezold.\r\n\r\nPARAGRAPH I.\r\n\r\n  _Raw._    X Ha Kha  ma ni s  a   melek[839]\r\n  _De S._     A  Kh   m  n  s  ah  sar(?)\r\n  _Bez._   _ᵐ_a  ḫa   ma ni iš  ’  šarru\r\n\r\n  _Raw._    (—)  (—)    x  Par   sa  i    melek\r\n  _De S._        sar i  ?

So spricht Darius der König: Acht in mitten\r\n  meiner Familie übten vor mir die Königsherrschaft aus.’\r\n\r\nIn the August of this year (1851) Rawlinson was able to announce that\r\nhe had met with an inscription that satisfactorily fixed the date of\r\nthe Lower Assyrian dynasty. We have said that this was in reality done\r\nlong before by Longpérier when he identified the Khorsabad king with\r\nthe Sargon of Isaiah (1847); and by Hincks, who was satisfied that\r\nthe builders of the later palaces were Sennacherib and Esarhaddon\r\n(1849). But we have seen that Rawlinson long refused to recognise these\r\nidentifications as satisfactorily established. At length, however, he\r\nfound in a tablet from Khorsabad (Pl. 70 Botta) an account which he\r\nacknowledged referred to the capture of Samaria by Sargon in the first\r\nyear of his reign; and he also succeeded in identifying ‘Omri.’[840] He\r\nthought that Sargon, whose identification he acknowledged in his Analysis\r\nof the Behistun inscription,[841] was the same personage as Shalmaneser,\r\nwho figures in the same inscription as the conqueror of Ashdod; and he\r\nmade out the names of other cities that fell before the arms of that\r\nking: ‘Hamath, Beroea, Damascus, Bambyce, Carchemish.’\r\n\r\nBut the inscription to which he now more particularly drew attention was\r\nrecently found by Mr. Layard on a colossal bull at the great entrance\r\nof the Kouyunjik Palace; and Rawlinson speedily recognised that it\r\ncontained the Annals of Sennacherib, its founder, and son of Sargon. The\r\nannals extend only to the seventh year of the king, but they recount the\r\nsubjugation of Babylon in the beginning of his reign, and the defeat of\r\nHezekiah and the capture of Jerusalem in his third year. The narrative\r\nagrees with what was already known from the Hebrew writings and from\r\nPolyhistor. The discovery, in a cuneiform inscription, of the three names\r\nHezekiah, Jerusalem and Judah, and an account of events related in the\r\nBook of Kings, naturally stimulated the interest of a wider public than\r\nis generally occupied with archæology.[842] From this period dates the\r\ngreat popularity these studies enjoyed for a time, a popularity that\r\nculminated more than twenty-five years later by the despatch of George\r\nSmith on a mission to the East by the ‘Daily Telegraph.’\r\n\r\nA year after the publication of the third column of the Behistun\r\ninscription, Hincks read a paper ‘On the Assyrio-Babylonian Phonetic\r\nCharacters’ (1852), which may be regarded as having closed the early\r\nstage of inquiry into the subject.[843] In this essay he contributes\r\nno less than a hundred and eighteen new values, of which sixty-eight\r\ncertainly, and possibly more, are correct. When these are added to\r\nthe Syllabarium of Rawlinson, upwards of two hundred correct signs,\r\nin addition to those for the vowels and diphthongs, were now at the\r\ndisposal of the decipherer. It had also been proved conclusively that\r\n‘the characters all represent syllables and were originally intended\r\nto represent a non-Semitic language.’ In opposition to the system that\r\nstill found an advocate in De Saulcy, it was shown that ‘instead of\r\nthe vowels being unrepresented, or only represented by points, as in\r\nall Semitic writing that was first applied to a Semitic language, we\r\nhave in the cuneatic inscriptions every vowel definitely expressed.’\r\nThis new Syllabarium demonstrates for the first time how extensively\r\npolyphony prevailed. Indeed one of its chief merits consists in the\r\nenumeration of the different values expressed by the same sign. This had\r\nbeen done to a slight extent by Rawlinson, who puts the polyphones in\r\nan apologetic manner in a separate column, under the heading ‘Phonetic\r\nPowers arising from Ideographic Values.’ This excited the contemptuous\r\ncriticism of De Saulcy, who was still so far from appreciating the true\r\nnature of the language that he declared: ‘Either this language was for\r\nthe Assyrian an inextricable _gâchis_, or one or other of these values\r\nmust be chosen.’[844] The present Memoir of Hincks, which must soon after\r\nhave fallen into his hands, ought to have convinced him that the former\r\nalternative is the only one available. Indeed the number of polyphones is\r\nso great that the two hundred and fifty-four characters which Hincks now\r\ndeals with express no less than three hundred and forty-four different\r\nvalues. In the Appendix to the Khorsabad inscription (January 19, 1850)\r\nit will be recollected that he gave seventy-one simple syllabic values,\r\nof which we found fifty-seven correct. In a lithographed paper, presented\r\nto a meeting of the British Association in the course of the same year,\r\nhe added to their number, so that, with the vowels, his contribution\r\namounted to a hundred. These apparently include the twenty-five (correct)\r\ncompound syllables already mentioned. In the present Memoir he added\r\na hundred and eighteen new values (sixty-eight correct), so that he\r\nclaims to have discovered by his own unassisted ingenuity no less than\r\ntwo hundred and eighteen values. He acknowledges that he is indebted to\r\nRawlinson for seventy-seven in addition to these, and he states that\r\nthey were substantially agreed as to the signification of one hundred\r\nand seventy-seven signs.[845] They disagree as to forty-nine; but the\r\ndisagreement, generally speaking, does not extend to the consonantal\r\nvalue; it arises from the doubt as to whether the sign conveys the\r\nvalue of _e_ or _o_, as Hincks thought, or of _i_ or _u_, as Rawlinson\r\nmaintained. Hincks frankly confesses he received seventy-seven values\r\nfrom Rawlinson after 1850; but Rawlinson has not told us how many\r\nvalues he borrowed from Hincks during that year. The probability is\r\nthey were extremely few, if any; the transliteration and translation\r\nof the inscriptions taken at Behistun and from the Black Obelisk were\r\nmade before the Appendix was sent to press, and neither could have\r\nbeen accomplished unless Rawlinson had previously drawn up a very\r\ncomprehensive list for his own use. No doubt he took full advantage of\r\nHincks’s paper to introduce occasional corrections and emendations, and\r\nit is to be regretted that he has not gratified our curiosity as to the\r\nextent of his obligations.\r\n\r\nIn the present Memoir Hincks modified in some respects his original mode\r\nof writing. Following Rawlinson’s example, he has discarded the use of\r\n_c_ in favour of _k_ for the Koph series; and he adopts _s_ to express\r\nthe three Hebrew sounds of _s_, _s̱_ and _š̱_ (_s_, _ts_, and _sh_). He\r\nalso follows Rawlinson in substituting _z_ for _j_, and _kh_ for _g_.\r\nAll these modifications have been accepted except the last, which is now\r\nwritten _ḫ_. On one other point, however, he was less conciliatory. In\r\ndeference to Rawlinson, he drops his two sounds for _a_: his long _ā_\r\nbecomes now simply _a_; but he insists on the distinct recognition of the\r\nunion of the consonant with _e_ or _o_. ‘We must,’ he says, ‘consider the\r\nseven forms which might belong to each.’ These forms, therefore, are now\r\n_a_, _e_ or _o_, _i_ and _u_; and one of the chief points of disagreement\r\nwith Rawlinson is that the latter ignores the sounds of _e_ or _o_ and\r\nsubstitutes either _i_ or _u_. Hincks was quite right in maintaining\r\nthat Rawlinson unduly neglected the vowel _e_; for his ‘Indiscriminate\r\nList’ only contains one syllable formed with _e_, viz. _ep_. Hincks\r\nwas, however, wrong in supposing that there is any regular syllabic\r\ncombinations so framed. The regular syllabic combinations are six, not\r\nseven, and they are formed with _a_, _i_ and _u_ only—as Rawlinson\r\nrightly saw. The combinations with _e_ are exceptions to the rule, and\r\nhave been ascribed to local or dialectic changes.[846] They amount to\r\nabout twelve and, strange to say, only one was correctly identified by\r\nHincks (_te_). The _o_ sound seems to be practically unknown.\r\n\r\nIn the passages we selected to illustrate Rawlinson’s transliteration of\r\nthe Behistun inscription, we placed that given by De Saulcy two years\r\nlater side by side with it, not on account of its intrinsic merit,\r\nbut because of the claims put forward on his behalf by some of his\r\ncountrymen. It seems to be generally admitted that the honour attaching\r\nto the first decipherment of the Babylonian inscriptions cannot be justly\r\nclaimed by more than three scholars—Hincks, Rawlinson and De Saulcy. We\r\nhave endeavoured to lay before the reader the contributions made by the\r\nfirst two. There can be no doubt that Hincks displayed remarkable insight\r\ninto the formation of the language, and that his ingenuity in detecting\r\nthe value of the signs, and in recognising their relation to one another\r\nwas very great. Whether he would have been able to go farther and acquire\r\nequal distinction as a translator is another question. His genius seems\r\nto have been more adapted to elucidate matters of grammar and philology.\r\nRawlinson had a rare ability of assimilating the suggestions of other\r\nscholars so quickly as to be almost oblivious that they were not\r\noriginal, and of carrying them rapidly to a perfection that was all his\r\nown. Thus Hincks’s elementary Syllabarium of 1850 appears in Rawlinson’s\r\nMemoir of 1851, so vastly improved as to be practically an independent\r\nwork. But the translation of the inscriptions was entirely his own, and\r\nin this department Hincks never entered into competition with him. Here,\r\naccording to M. Menant, his rival was De Saulcy. It is unfortunate that\r\nDe Saulcy’s early contributions should have become almost inaccessible,\r\nand we have not found any detailed account of their contents.[847] They\r\ndate from 1847, but his earliest efforts, even according to M. Menant,\r\nonly deserve mention because the author himself was disposed to treat\r\nthem too severely.[848] On June 20, 1847, in a letter to Burnouf, he\r\nattempted to identify some of the kings mentioned in a genealogical\r\nfragment found at Van. Ten days later he endeavoured to solve the riddle\r\nof the second name in the Khorsabad inscription. In the following\r\nJuly he suggested that the name on the Michaux stone should be read\r\n‘Saosdoukin’; and in December he imagined that he had found the sense of\r\nthe Van inscriptions. He, however, honestly confesses that in the light\r\nof subsequent knowledge all these efforts were vain. ‘He has,’ he says,\r\n‘passed the sponge over all he has hitherto done, and has recommenced the\r\nstudy of Assyrian _ab ovo_.’[849]\r\n\r\nIn 1849, however, he contributed two pamphlets which it is admitted\r\nwere of greater importance. In the first, which appeared on September\r\n14, he undertook a transcription of the Babylonian column of the Elvend\r\ninscription with translation and analysis. He succeeded, we are told, in\r\nseparating the Babylonian signs correctly, so that each group could be\r\ncompared word for word with the Persian. In his analysis he is said to\r\nhave justified the values he attributed to each sign, and the meaning\r\nhe attached to each word. He regarded the signs as purely consonantal,\r\nand sought to bring them all into relation with the twenty-two Hebrew\r\nletters. He seems to have thought that some of the signs are capable of\r\ndivision: one portion fixed, representing the consonant, and the other\r\na variable appendix indicating the vowel. In the second pamphlet, dated\r\nNovember 27, he treated the Persepolitan inscriptions in the same manner,\r\nbut with a growing suspicion that the Assyrian letters might after all\r\nturn out to be syllabic.[850] By this means he arrived at the consonantal\r\nsound of a hundred and twenty signs which M. Menant says were generally\r\ncorrect. When Rawlinson published his Syllabarium, in 1851 (two years\r\nlater) De Saulcy observed that sixty-eight of these one hundred and\r\ntwenty signs received the same values. Not satisfied with this success,\r\nhe seems actually to have thought that Rawlinson had borrowed them\r\nwithout acknowledgment from him: ‘J’avais donc lu et publié avant M.\r\nRawlinson soixante-huit des valeurs exactes publiées par lui; il eût\r\nété de bon goût, peut-être, de prendre, ne fût-ce qu’une seule fois, la\r\npeine de citer mon nom.’[851] It is, of course, quite impossible to admit\r\nthe claims made on his behalf. We have not been able to see the signs\r\nto which reference is made, but it is quite certain that, in September\r\n1849, there were not sixty-eight signs in the Persepolitan inscription\r\nstill remaining unknown either to Hincks or Rawlinson. It must be\r\nrecollected that De Saulcy’s pamphlets appeared more than two years after\r\nHincks had already accomplished a somewhat similar classification with\r\na considerable measure of success; and therefore after the consonantal\r\nvalues of a large number of signs had long been correctly ascertained.\r\nOn the other hand, the earlier papers of Hincks were quite accessible to\r\nDe Saulcy, and we learn from Mohl that they were well known in France a\r\nyear before the appearance of his two pamphlets.[852] ‘What,’ asks M.\r\nMenant, ‘did Rawlinson owe to De Saulcy’s labours on the Assyrian text?\r\nIt is impossible to say,’ he answers, ‘for Rawlinson has not given an\r\naccount of his preliminary studies.’[853] The answer is, however, much\r\nsimpler than this. Rawlinson owes nothing to De Saulcy, for the reason\r\nthat his transliteration of the Behistun inscription was accomplished\r\nbefore he left Bagdad in October 1849,[854] and therefore before it\r\nwas possible for him to receive even the earliest of De Saulcy’s\r\npamphlets. Menant afterwards concedes that Rawlinson’s work on the\r\nObelisk proves preliminary labours which he graciously admits may justly\r\nclaim to be independent.[855] Nor is it true, as Menant says, that ‘it\r\nwas by following De Saulcy’s steps that all later progress has been\r\naccomplished.’[856] The precise opposite approaches more nearly to the\r\ntruth. It was by abandoning the alphabetical system, to which De Saulcy\r\nclung with strange pertinacity to the last, that all later progress\r\nwas in reality accomplished; and two months after these pamphlets were\r\nwritten this was precisely what was done by Hincks with unmistakable\r\nperspicuity in the Appendix to his Khorsabad Essay.\r\n\r\nThe two tracts of De Saulcy, written in 1849, gave the transliteration\r\naccording to his peculiar system of the whole of the Achaemenian\r\ninscriptions accessible to him. The text of the Behistun inscription had\r\nnot, of course, escaped as yet from the jealous hands of the English\r\nMajor. The translation of these inscriptions was comparatively easy, for\r\nit was only necessary to follow the Persian version, which was already\r\nknown. De Saulcy may therefore claim to be the first who accomplished\r\nthis task, which neither Hincks nor Rawlinson thought necessary to\r\nattempt. But De Saulcy did not rest satisfied with this achievement. On\r\nFebruary 3, 1850, he published a transliteration of ninety-six lines of\r\nthe inscription engraved upon the bulls at the entrance to Khorsabad;\r\nand he accompanied it by a translation, which two years later he still\r\nconsidered was sufficiently accurate. On February 12, he also contributed\r\na Memoir on the Royal Names at Nimrud.[857] These two publications\r\nappeared between Major Rawlinson’s lectures of January 19 and February\r\n16. In the first lecture, Rawlinson gave the earliest translation of a\r\npurely Assyrian inscription that had ever appeared, with the exception of\r\nthe few lines rendered by Longpérier and Hincks. It was taken from the\r\nBlack Obelisk, and he promised to read at the next sitting a _précis_\r\nof the Khorsabad inscription.[858] It was clear, therefore, that he\r\nhad already prepared it. Meanwhile, after this announcement was made,\r\nand thirteen days before it was carried into execution, De Saulcy’s\r\ntranslation appeared. This forms the second long Assyrian inscription to\r\nbe translated, and it can scarcely be denied that De Saulcy and Rawlinson\r\nhad worked upon it independently of each other. The report of Rawlinson’s\r\nsecond lecture was given in the ‘Athenæum’ on March 2. It is, as we have\r\nsaid, impossible to estimate the comparative merits of the two works,\r\nbecause we have not seen De Saulcy’s pamphlet. It can only be judged by\r\nwhat we know of that writer’s later acquirements.\r\n\r\nThe transliteration from which we have quoted made its appearance in\r\nFebruary 1854, having apparently been sent to press in June 1853, or some\r\nthree years after Rawlinson’s version of the same text.[859] It cannot,\r\ntherefore, claim the indulgence so willingly accorded to a first effort;\r\non the contrary, it is distinctly put forward as a rival Essay, intended\r\nto prove ‘the essential error of Rawlinson’s method of reading.’ It was\r\ndesigned at the same time to show that not one of the general results\r\nreached in the two Memoirs of 1849 had now to be abandoned, and also to\r\nestablish his legitimate right to a large share of priority of discovery\r\nto which De Saulcy says he attached great value. We have already disposed\r\nof his claims to priority so far as regards the consonantal values of the\r\nBabylonian signs found in the trilingual inscriptions, and we are at a\r\nloss to imagine in what other direction he fancied that he had achieved\r\npriority. So far indeed from his studies having ever been in advance of\r\nhis contemporaries, they uniformly lagged far behind, and he evinces a\r\nsingular inability even to follow the results obtained by their genius.\r\nA remarkable instance of this is seen in his rejection of Longpérier’s\r\nreading of ‘Sargon’ in the Khorsabad inscription. ‘The _kh_, _k_ or _g_,’\r\nhe writes in 1852, ‘is in reality a _d_’; and in the Table he published\r\nin 1854 it is actually found under that heading. He regrets that he is\r\nobliged to renounce all hope of finding the ‘Sargon of the Bible’ at\r\nKhorsabad; and he reads ‘Sardon’ instead.\r\n\r\nDe Saulcy still adheres to his alphabetical interpretation, and it is\r\nno doubt the syllabarium of Rawlinson that is ‘the essential error’ he\r\nsets himself to remove. His transliteration accordingly consists, as the\r\nreader will have observed, of an immense agglomeration of consonants\r\nwhich the student is left to bring within the possibilities of human\r\nutterance as best he may. It is clearly a comparatively easy task to\r\narrange a number of signs according to the simple consonantal sounds they\r\ncontain. Hincks reached this point in 1847, and De Saulcy’s latest effort\r\nseems to carry us back to that rudimentary stage of the inquiry. Here\r\nwe find the signs distributed among the various classes of gutturals,\r\ndentals and so on, exactly as in Hincks’s Table seven years before. It\r\nis possible that the later writer is more complete and accurate; it could\r\nscarcely have been otherwise, considering the large amount of data now\r\navailable and the impossibility of not being guided, to some extent at\r\nleast, by the Syllabarium of Rawlinson and Hincks. Yet in this elementary\r\nwork of simple classification there are numerous errors he might have\r\nescaped if he had condescended to place more dependence upon their\r\nauthority. Thus, for example, among his gutturals we find (of course bare\r\nand stripped of their vocalic garments) the signs for _ip_, _up_, _al_\r\nand _zi_. His dentals include two gutturals, the signs for _ga_ and _gi_.\r\nAmong his labials he gives us the signs for _as_ and _ku_. Among his\r\nlinguals are those for _ki_ and _su_ and they include the signs for the\r\nsyllables _tar_, _kur_ and _rit_; while the sign for _ul_ is found among\r\nthe sibilants. Notwithstanding all his efforts to escape syllabic values,\r\nhe was forced to enumerate a few—_kam_, _ak_, _akh_, _at_, _bar_, _far_,\r\n_in_ or _an_, _ar_, _as_, _is_. Some of these are correct; but not even\r\nhere would he submit to authority, and he has accordingly blundered. His\r\n_ak_ should be _uk_, his _akh al_, his _far par_, and of the two signs\r\nhe gives for _as_, one should be _si_ and the other _sur_, while his\r\n_is_ should be _us_. With few exceptions all these might have been found\r\ncorrectly given by Rawlinson three years before. Hincks had long ago\r\npointed out in his Khorsabad Essay (June 1849) that a clear distinction\r\nis maintained between the vowels, and between the surd and sonant\r\nconsonants. Yet here we find the signs for _m_, _w_, _ou_ and _b_, and\r\nthose for _l_ and _r_ all classed indifferently together. His treatment\r\nof the vowels is not less behind the knowledge of the time. The single\r\nvowel _a_ is represented by no less than seven signs that really express\r\n_an_, _a_, _ap_, _i_, _ruh_, _man_, _it_. Two of these signs, according\r\nto De Saulcy, also express _ha_, and one either _e_ or _i_. _Ha_ has four\r\nsigns, none correct. They are really the signs for _a_, _it_, _i_ and\r\n_il_. He was correct in supposing the language contained two diphthongs,\r\n_ai_ and _ia_; but neither of his signs for _ai_ is correct: one has, in\r\nfact, the value of _tir_.\r\n\r\nIt may be said in conclusion that on all points of difference between\r\nRawlinson and De Saulcy, both as regards the theory of the language\r\nand the details of its expression, Rawlinson was right and De Saulcy\r\nhopelessly wrong. De Saulcy was not only unable to teach Rawlinson\r\nanything, but, as we have already observed, he was incapable to a very\r\nremarkable degree of apprehending the truth from others. He lived for\r\nmany years afterwards, but his Essay on the Behistun inscription seems\r\nto have been the last occasion on which he meddled with cuneiform\r\nstudies. He probably recognised more clearly than some of his admirers\r\nhow incompetent he was to make any useful contribution to the subject.\r\nIt is impossible to refrain from sympathy with him. He tells us he\r\nspent a whole year in ‘comparing sign by sign and transcribing all the\r\nAchaemenian texts without exception.’[860] Nothing is more calculated\r\nto overwhelm the mind with despondency than to pass years of fruitless\r\ntoil amid such arid wastes as these and to discover in the end that the\r\nnatural ability to make useful application of the knowledge acquired\r\nis wholly wanting. For the true genius of a decipherer is a rare gift,\r\nand no amount of industry or learning can compensate for its absence.\r\nHincks and Rawlinson possessed it with exceptional intensity. Many\r\nof the other scholars whose labours we have reviewed were endowed to\r\na less degree—Grotefend, Jacquet and Lassen. Even Longpérier, in the\r\nfew lines he contributed to the subject evinced no little aptitude in\r\nthis direction; but De Saulcy was singularly deficient in the special\r\nqualifications it required. It would have been more worthy of the\r\nposition he occupied in other departments of study if he could have\r\nrestrained the irritation that the consciousness of the waste of so\r\nmuch effort could not fail to produce. It was lamentable that he should\r\nfretfully pretend to have anticipated the discoveries of Rawlinson, or\r\nthat he should have presented his own crude performance as a possible\r\nrival to his. It would almost seem, from the extreme rarity of his\r\npamphlets, that he endeavoured to suppress the evidence of his failure,\r\nand it would be well if his countrymen were to allow his work in this\r\ndepartment to pass out of the reach of farther controversy.\r\n\r\nThe translation of the Babylonian Column of the Behistun inscription\r\nwas apparently thought at the time to dispense with the necessity of\r\nany special publication of the Semitic columns of the other Achaemenian\r\ninscriptions at Persepolis and Naksh-i-Rustam. De Saulcy had indeed\r\ndevoted himself to this portion of the subject in 1849, and Menant\r\ninforms us that ‘all the trilingual inscriptions then known were\r\nalready translated.’[861] But they do not appear to have attracted\r\nthe attention of any more competent scholar till 1859, when M. Oppert\r\npublished a portion of them in the second volume of his ‘Expédition en\r\nMésopotamie.’ He gave the text, with transliteration and translation\r\nof the Window inscription L and B (Darius); D and E (Xerxes), and the\r\nunilingual H (Darius) from Persepolis; the long inscription and the\r\nthree short ones at Naksh-i-Rustam, the K of Xerxes at Van, and the S\r\nof Artaxerxes Mnemon at Susa. He also gave a new translation of the\r\nBehistun inscription without text or transliteration. A peculiar feature\r\nof his book is that he has made a transcription of the inscription into\r\nHebrew characters. A complete edition of the Babylonian columns of the\r\nAchaemenian inscriptions was published by Dr. Bezold in 1882, with text,\r\ntransliteration, translation and commentary, and is now the standard\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nWe have now brought to a close this tedious history of the various steps\r\nthat led up to the decipherment of the Achaemenian inscriptions; and we\r\nhave described the share taken in its accomplishment by a long succession\r\nof scholars, from Tychsen to Oppert. The whole of these inscriptions\r\nwere now interpreted and their contents made known to the world. The\r\ndifficulties of the cuneiform character, which at first appeared\r\ninsuperable, were at length surmounted.\r\n\r\nThe subject for a long time seemed to yield no results at all\r\ncommensurate to the labour and ability lavished upon it. Its interest\r\nseemed to be limited to the arid domains of philology, or at best to\r\nthrow a sidelight upon a few matters of no great importance in ancient\r\nhistory. Some scholars were gratified to find that their old and greatly\r\nmaligned friend Herodotus was ascertained to be much more trustworthy\r\nthan was long supposed; but these were matters that could only affect\r\na small and comparatively worthless class of _dilettanti_. At length,\r\nhowever, there came the great Assyrian discoveries and the apparition in\r\nthe cuneiform records of ‘Jehu, the son of Omri,’ and a host of other\r\nnotabilities of sacred history. The study was raised at once, especially\r\nin England, to an entirely different plane of interest. Lectures began\r\nto be delivered upon it throughout the provinces; books were written\r\nby Vaux, Bonomi, Fergusson, and many others, to explain the subject to\r\nthe public. The great work of Layard was quickly followed by a popular\r\nedition, and was translated into German. Curiosity was stimulated\r\nby the appearance, in 1853, of an account of the results of farther\r\nexplorations. Whether the new learning would tend to confirm the ancient\r\nrecords or whether it would compel a revision of cherished beliefs\r\nbegan to be debated in many quarters, far beyond the circle of learned\r\nsocieties.\r\n\r\nAn account of the progress subsequently made in the knowledge of the\r\nAssyrian language lies beyond the scope of our present work. It was\r\nindeed a happy accident that the power of reading Assyrian should have\r\nbeen acquired just as a countless number of inscriptions in that language\r\nwere brought to light. Excavations continued at Nineveh and elsewhere\r\nunder the direction of Mr. Layard during the winters of 1849 and 1850;\r\nand in the autumn of 1851, Colonel Rawlinson returned to Bagdad.\r\nHe was charged with the general supervision of the work, while Mr.\r\nHormuzd Rassam assumed the practical direction in the field. Parliament\r\nsanctioned a grant of three thousand pounds, and many large sums were\r\ncontributed by private individuals, including five hundred pounds\r\nfrom Lord John Russell.[862] Soon after, Rassam discovered the famous\r\ninscription of Tiglath Peleser, which afforded the earliest glimpse into\r\na long-forgotten history. In it the genealogy of the Assyrian kings was\r\ntraced back to the fourteenth century B.C., and the names of no less than\r\ntwenty-five sovereigns were recorded.[863] The inscription itself was\r\nwritten at a time when Assur was still the capital of the kingdom and\r\nNineveh was too unimportant to be mentioned. Rawlinson was surprised to\r\nfind that the language was more polished then than at a later time, and\r\nhe was obliged to admit that the discovery ‘annihilates all my theories\r\nabout the modernicity of Assyrian civilisation.’[864] Shortly after, he\r\nwas able to announce that ‘all the Assyrian kings mentioned in the Bible\r\nhave now been identified,’[865] and many others who occur in profane\r\nhistory, so, that almost a perfect list has now been obtained. Two French\r\nexpeditions were engaged at the same time on the work of exploration. M.\r\nPlace, from 1851 to 1854, devoted himself chiefly to Khorsabad, though\r\nwith scarcely the success his perseverance merited. But the chief effort\r\nwas made by the Commission headed by M. Fresnal, 1852-4, which included\r\nM. Oppert among its members, and which concerned itself principally with\r\nthe exploration of the ruins of Babylon. Meanwhile Southern Babylonia\r\nwas explored by Mr. Loftus, whom we have already mentioned in connection\r\nwith Susa; and by Mr. Taylor, the Vice-Consul at Bussorah. It is to their\r\nlabours during the winters of 1853 and 1854 that we owe the recovery of\r\nthe history of the Early Babylonian Empire that long preceded even the\r\nfoundation of Assyria. The forgotten cities of Nippur, Erech, Larsa,\r\nUr and Eridu were once more summoned to surrender the records of a\r\ncivilisation reaching back many thousand years before the Christian\r\nera. In 1854, Rawlinson was able to send home a list of eighteen of the\r\nprimitive kings of the ancient Babylonia and of twenty other personages\r\nof less exalted station; and he records his surprise at the discovery of\r\n‘monarchs who must have reigned before the establishment of the Assyrian\r\nEmpire.’[866] Till then it was generally held that Babylon owed its\r\nfoundation to the late period of the great Nebuchadnezzar.[867] Early in\r\n1854, a fruitful discovery was made in the Lion Room of the North Palace\r\nof Assurbanipal at Kouyunjik.[868] Here large numbers of tablets were\r\nfound, which subsequent investigation showed to consist of lexicons and\r\nphrase-books to enable the student to acquire the primitive language of\r\nBabylonia, from which it afterwards became apparent the larger portion\r\nof the Assyrian literature had been derived. Rawlinson was the first to\r\ndetect the existence of this language in a tablet sent to him from Larsa\r\nby Mr. Loftus.[869] He announced the discovery in a valuable paper,\r\ncontributed to the ‘Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society’ in 1855, on\r\nthe Early History of Babylonia. At that time, however, he had made but\r\nlittle progress in this new study, for he says: ‘I have no hesitation in\r\npronouncing the language to be Semitic.’[870] In the following year he\r\nfound out his mistake, and, having carefully studied the vocabularies\r\nfrom Kouyunjik, he speaks of it more guardedly as ‘the Chaldean or\r\nHamitic language of Babylonia.’[871] Six years later, we still hear\r\nof the ‘Hamitian language, of which not much is yet understood.’[872]\r\nFor a time it was known also as the Proto-Chaldean;[873] Hincks seems\r\nto have been the first to call it by its later name of Akkadian,[874]\r\nbut Rawlinson was the earliest to make any considerable progress in\r\nits study. In 1866, he endeavoured to translate the tablets bearing on\r\nastronomy and other scientific subjects; but he found ‘the primitive\r\nBabylonian language’ was so extensively employed in these documents\r\nthat it was ‘advisable to undertake a thorough examination of this\r\nancient and most difficult language.’ The result was that he thought it\r\nwas intermediate between the African languages and the Proto-Turanian\r\nor Finno-Ugrian, which he proposed to classify under the name of the\r\n‘Erythean Group.’ He considered it came from the uplands of Central\r\nAfrica, and was the speech of the Akkads or Highlanders. From that\r\ncircumstance it gradually acquired the name of Akkadian, suggested by\r\nHincks.[875]\r\n\r\nThe recovery of this ancient language is among the most interesting\r\nresults of cuneiform discovery. The most ancient records in the world are\r\nwritten in it, and it opens a page of history hitherto entirely unknown.\r\nIt shows that a Turanian race led the van of civilisation, and was the\r\nfounder of both the religion and literature of the Semitic people of Irak.\r\n\r\nThe first period of discovery was now drawing to a close. The French\r\nretired in 1854, and Colonel Rawlinson in March 1855. Nearly twenty years\r\nwere to elapse before the excavations were renewed by George Smith, in\r\n1873.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the number of scholars interested in these subjects began to\r\nincrease. Dr. Samuel Birch did good service in assisting the publication\r\nof Layard’s inscriptions.[876] Mr. Bosanquet contributed a large\r\nnumber of articles on the questions of chronology raised by these new\r\ndiscoveries,[877] a matter that also occupied Rawlinson.[878] Hincks\r\nalso turned his attention to translation, and it is to him we owe the\r\ntranslations in Mr. Layard’s ‘Nineveh and Babylon,’ published in 1853,\r\nand also a version of the Bavian inscription.[879] In 1854 he wrote an\r\nessay on Assyrian mythology, but he still continued to be chiefly engaged\r\nwith the grammar. His dissertation on the Pronoun appeared in 1853; on\r\nthe Verb in 1855 to 1856, a work that has been characterised as his most\r\nvaluable contribution;[880] on Akkadian, 1855; on Tiglath Peleser, 1857;\r\non Polyphony, 1863; and finally a treatise on Assyrian Grammar, begun in\r\n1866 in the ‘Journal of the Asiatic Society,’ which was interrupted by\r\nhis death. Mr. Fox Talbot was also added to the number of translators.\r\nIn 1856 he rendered a portion of the East India House inscription, and\r\nfor a number of years he applied himself to the translation of the most\r\nimportant inscriptions.[881] Mr. Norris, relieved from the burden of\r\nthe Susian Column, turned his attention to Assyrian weights (1856), and\r\nsubsequently became known as the author of the first Assyrian dictionary\r\n(1866).[882] In France, M. Oppert acquired an interest in Assyrian during\r\nhis recent journey to the East, and he earned a reputation in this\r\ndepartment of study by the appearance of his ‘Etudes Assyriennes’ in the\r\n‘Journal Asiatique,’ February 1857. From that period he has continued\r\nto be one of the most prolific and the most useful of the cuneiform\r\nscholars of France. The number of these was farther increased by the\r\nappearance of M. Menant, in 1858, as the writer of a ‘Notice sur les\r\nInscriptions cunéiformes de la Collection de M. L. de Laval.’[883] Soon\r\nafterwards (1860) he published the ‘Ecritures cunéiformes,’ an ‘Exposé\r\ndes Travaux qui ont préparé la Lecture des Inscriptions,’ which is still\r\na useful apology for the science.[884] For, notwithstanding all the\r\nmagnificent results already obtained, the science was still in need of\r\nan apologist.[885] In 1852, Professor Wilson, the President of the Royal\r\nAsiatic Society, went so far as to regard the Assyrian Inscriptions as\r\nstill ‘merely dumb memorials of antiquity.’[886] Very great discrepancies\r\nwere indeed yet to be found in translations of the same passages by\r\ndifferent scholars, and the true meaning of a large number of words\r\ncontinued to be warmly disputed. It was found, in fact, that M. Stern of\r\nGöttingen still maintained that the language was entirely alphabetical;\r\nthat there were no ideographs; and he read every syllable of one\r\ninscription differently from De Saulcy, except the proper names.[887]\r\nMr. Fox Talbot attributed the prevailing incredulity ‘to the fact that\r\neach cuneiform group represents not always the same syllables, but\r\nsometimes one and sometimes another’: in other words, to the existence\r\nof polyphones. Hence it was inferred that the system adopted ‘cannot be\r\ntrue, and the interpretations based upon it must be fallacious.’[888]\r\nHe proposed, therefore, to submit the whole matter to a practical test.\r\nHe accordingly translated the inscription of Tiglath Peleser, recently\r\nfound at Kaleh Sherghat, and forwarded it in a sealed envelope to the\r\nPresident of the Asiatic Society. Three other scholars—Rawlinson,\r\nHincks, and Oppert—were then invited to make independent versions of the\r\nsame inscription, and to communicate them under cover to the Society.\r\nCarefully lithographed copies had been executed for this purpose, so that\r\nthere might be no variation in the text. A competent jury of examiners\r\nwere selected, among whom were Professor Wilson (the President), Mr.\r\nGrote, Dean Milman, Sir Gardner Wilkinson, and Whewell; and on the day\r\nappointed the sealed packets were opened in their presence. It was\r\nfound that Dr. Hincks had not had time to translate the whole, and that\r\nOppert had committed the double blunder of working from a copy executed\r\nby himself, and of making his translation in English, a language with\r\nwhich he was imperfectly acquainted. A careful comparison was, however,\r\nundertaken, and the Jury issued their report on May 29, 1857. Grote and\r\nMilman were of opinion ‘that the coincidences between the translations,\r\nboth as to the sense and the verbal rendering, were very remarkable.’\r\nWilkinson made a separate report, and stated that ‘the similarity is\r\nquite equal to what it would be in the translation of an ordinary\r\nhistorical inscription in Egyptian hieroglyphics.’ ‘Indeed,’ he adds,\r\n‘the resemblance is so great (very often exactly the same, word for word)\r\nthat the interpretation could not be arbitrary’; but while ‘there is a\r\nremarkable concurrence as to the general meaning of each paragraph ...\r\nvery many words were differently translated.’ The closest resemblance was\r\nfound to exist between the versions of Rawlinson and Hincks. Talbot was\r\n‘less positive and precise,’ and Oppert showed the greatest divergence.\r\nThe examiners farther noted their opinion passage by passage, and as we\r\nlook down the pages, among many verdicts of ‘very near,’ ‘much alike,’\r\nand so on, we find other judgments much less satisfactory, such as\r\n‘many coincidences and many variations’; ‘some coincidences and great\r\nvariations’; and even ‘totally different.’\r\n\r\nMuch indeed yet remained to be done before accuracy could be achieved,\r\nand the voice of the doubter was not yet stilled. In France especially,\r\nthe greatest scepticism prevailed as to the genuineness of the\r\ntranslations, and those of Oppert, in the ‘Journal Asiatique’ were\r\nreceived with general incredulity.[889] Neither De Saulcy nor Longpérier\r\ntook any farther share in the work, and their silence increased the\r\ndiscouragement. A very eminent Frenchman, Count de Gobineau, had just\r\nwritten on the ‘Ecritures des Textes cunéiformes’ and attacked the\r\nwhole system pursued by Rawlinson and Oppert.[890] The one he proposed\r\nto substitute is too grotesque to merit description, but the defection\r\nof a scholar so well known in Oriental studies intensified the growing\r\nunbelief.[891] It was at this conjuncture that Menant published his\r\nbook on Cuneiform Writing, in which he related the successive steps\r\nthat had led up to the decipherment of the inscriptions (1860): an\r\nundertaking which he describes four years later, in his second edition,\r\nas having slowly produced a beneficial effect. Some people may have been\r\nmore influenced by the striking reward conferred upon M. Oppert by the\r\nInstitut in 1860, which awarded him the prize of twenty thousand francs,\r\nfounded by the Emperor for the ‘work or the discovery most calculated\r\nto the honour of France,’ and this, we learn with surprise, afforded\r\n‘une sanction qui devrait dissiper toutes les susceptibilités.’ These\r\nsusceptibilities were, however, by no means dispelled by any such\r\nImperial mandate. Mohl writes with evident sympathy that ‘people decry\r\na language in which one can never know if a syllable is ideographic or\r\nphonetic, and, when phonetic, which of two or three different values\r\nit may have in that place.’[892] Gobineau still remained recalcitrant\r\n(1864), and Sir George Cornewall Lewis contended in the ‘Astronomy of the\r\nAncients’ that neither Egyptian nor Assyrian could ever be restored.[893]\r\nLord Macaulay also rejected the interpretation with undisguised\r\ncontempt.[894] It was only by slow degrees that these doubts were finally\r\nextinguished, and that the cuneiform languages have conquered the\r\nuniversal recognition of all competent inquirers.\r\n\r\nWhen Rawlinson returned from Bagdad in 1855, he was appointed a Director\r\nof the East India Company, and he entered Parliament as Member for\r\nReigate. In 1859 he went to Persia as British envoy, a position from\r\nwhich he retired in the following year.\r\n\r\nAfter his resignation, he devoted himself for some years almost\r\nexclusively to his old cuneiform pursuits. He undertook to supervise\r\nthe publication of the ‘Inscriptions of Western Asia,’ and he might be\r\nfound at work upon them daily at the British Museum. Mr. George Smith\r\nwas appointed his working assistant, and in that position he gained\r\nthe intimate knowledge of the Assyrian language which he afterwards\r\nturned to such excellent account. The first volume of the Inscriptions\r\nappeared in 1859, and the last, or fifth, in 1884.[895] Rawlinson\r\nentered Parliament once more in 1865, as Member for Frome, but retired\r\non his re-appointment to the India Office in 1868. He fell a victim to\r\ninfluenza in 1895, at the age of eighty-five. During his life he was\r\ngradually overwhelmed with honours bestowed upon him by learned Societies\r\nin various quarters of the globe;[896] but a grateful country was long\r\nreluctant to confer its seal of recognition. Military authorities are\r\nnaturally unwilling to acknowledge the merits of distinguished officers\r\nwho descend to civil employments; and in 1851, after the publication of\r\nthe Behistun inscription, he had to sue in somewhat humble terms for\r\npromotion to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. On his return from Bagdad\r\nin 1855, when the walls of the Museum were lined with the trophies he\r\nhad accumulated and the country was enraptured with the new arcana of\r\nknowledge his genius had unveiled, Lord Clarendon thought a knighthood\r\nworthy of his acceptance. This he hastened to decline, and shortly\r\nafterwards he received the more appropriate honour of K.C.B. (1856).\r\n\r\nThe dignities to which he subsequently rose were due to political\r\nservices and social position, and seem to have been entirely unconnected\r\nwith the achievements we have recounted.\r\n\r\nAs for Dr. Hincks, he appears never to have obtained any reward whatever,\r\nunless the Gold Medal of a provincial academy can be regarded as\r\nsuch.[897] He had the misfortune to be born an Irishman, and to fill\r\nthe obscure position of a country clergyman, so that he was, no doubt,\r\nreconciled from the first to the inevitable sequence of disparagement\r\nand neglect. After all, hieroglyphic figures and cuneiform signs are\r\ninconvenient subjects for pulpit oratory, and not likely to edify a\r\nrustic congregation or to lead to preferment in the Church. The estimate\r\nin which he was held, even in learned circles, may be gathered from\r\nthe short paragraph allotted to him in the ‘Athenæum,’[898] where\r\nhe explained one of the most far-reaching discoveries in Assyrian,\r\nas compared to the three long columns that follow, devoted to a few\r\nunimportant observations made by Rawlinson. But notwithstanding his\r\napparent failure to obtain the recognition that was his due, when the\r\nevening of life approached and the time for departure came, he could\r\ndwell with satisfaction on the work of his life; and though in the years\r\nto come few might remember his name, he could not fail to enjoy the\r\nconviction that the rich fields of knowledge he had opened to view would\r\nremain the assured possession of man for all generations to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDICES\r\n\r\n\r\nA.—TABLE SHOWING VALUES ASSIGNED TO THE LETTERS OF THE OLD

They have not been\r\ndone justice to in the works of those travellers.’—_Second Journey\r\nthrough Persia_ (London, 1818), p. 76.\r\n\r\n[84] Morier says Le Bruyn has exaggerated the mutilation. _A Journey\r\nthrough Persia_, by James Morier (London, 1812; referred to as _First\r\nJourney_), p. 134. Elsewhere he says the faces of _all_ the figures to\r\nthe right are mutilated; _Second Journey_, p. 76.\r\n\r\n[85] In Porter’s drawing this personage appears at the other end of the\r\nrow. _Cf._ Plates, Niebuhr, ii. 120, and Porter, _Travels in Georgia_, i.\r\n670.\r\n\r\n[86] Niebuhr, ii. 117.\r\n\r\n[87] Niebuhr, _ib._ p. 111.\r\n\r\n[88] P. 125.\r\n\r\n[89] _Supra_, pp. 71, 73.\r\n\r\n[90] Niebuhr, _ib._ p. 112.\r\n\r\n[91] _Ib._ p. 113.\r\n\r\n[92] This, as we have noticed, had been already done by Flower.\r\n\r\n[93] P. 117. Professor Sayce makes the obvious remark that another easy\r\nway of settling this point is the consideration ‘that the ends of all the\r\nlines were exactly underneath each other on the left side, whereas they\r\nterminated irregularly on the right.’ _Fresh Lights from the Monuments_,\r\nby A. H. Sayce (1890), p. 10.\r\n\r\n[94] ‘Quelques voyageurs en ont tiré la conséquence que les anciens\r\nPerses ayent écrit de haut en bas, commes les Chinois. Mais si l’on\r\nexamine de plus près les inscriptions, comme quelques uns les ont copiées\r\nicy, et qu’on les compare avec mes copies, on trouvera que les lignes\r\nqui sont droites sont toutes couchées de côté, ce qui fait que le nombre\r\ndes lettres n’est à beaucoup près pas si grand que peut-être on a pu le\r\npenser d’après les copies de mes prédécesseurs.’ Niebuhr, _ib._ p. 113.\r\n\r\n[95] P. 126.

They were afterwards\r\ngiven to the British Museum, and for a long time were the only materials\r\nfor the study of Persian art. The practice of taking away specimens\r\nseems to have been continued by later travellers, and, as Porter says,\r\nmuch of value was ‘doomed to the predatory mallet’ (p. 632). When Rich\r\nvisited the ruins in 1821, he observed that ‘many parts had been defaced\r\nby the passion for preserving curiosities. This rage has induced some\r\neven to chip off bits of inscriptions. One has endeavoured to chisel off\r\na very fine head, which was well preserved, and, not succeeding, he has\r\napparently in wrath thrown his mallet against the head and smashed it.’\r\n(_Koordistan_, ii. 222.) Rich found the inscription on the robe of the\r\nking in the Palace of Xerxes had suffered from these proceedings. ‘They\r\nhave been variously defaced by people chipping off pieces (mostly very\r\nrecently) for curiosities. I have copied what remains of three of them’\r\n(_Babylon and Persepolis_, Pl. 19). A disease visited the people of the\r\ncountry shortly after, and those of them who had assisted in these acts\r\nof Vandalism thought themselves justly punished.

We have used the edition of 1824 as\r\nthe more accessible. On comparing it with the earlier edition of 1815,\r\nwe have not found any difference of importance. Both editions contain\r\nthe same two plates. No. 1 is taken from De Sacy, as above, and edited\r\nby Tychsen. It gives Grotefend’s alphabet exactly as it subsequently\r\nappeared, but without the later emendations of the _sr_ and _k_, together\r\nwith the long list of defective signs. At the bottom is a transliteration\r\nof the Xerxes inscription (G). No. 2 is by Grotefend. It gives the\r\ncuneiform text in the three species of writing of the inscriptions of\r\nXerxes and Cyrus, and that on the Caylus Vase, with the translation. The\r\nthree columns are divided so as to show the words of each species that\r\ncorrespond to one another. Kaulen says Grotefend’s essay appeared in\r\nthe second edition of 1805 (_Assyrien und Babylonien_, 1899, p. 126).\r\nWeisbach says its first appearance was in 1815 (_Achämenideninschriften\r\nZweiter Art_, 1890, p. 3).

I can only illustrate\r\nthe formation of the different groups by adverting to the law which\r\nstill prevails in the Tartarian dialects, requiring the juxtaposition of\r\ncertain vowels with consonants in order to render the latter articulable;\r\nand by observing that, as a similar rule appears to hold good in the\r\nso-called Median alphabet, which has every indication of a Scythic\r\norigin, it is not improbable that the Persian writing may have been\r\nindebted to that source for so remarkable a deviation from the true\r\nprinciples of Arian orthography.’ _J.

R. I.\r\nAcad._ xxi. 131); and in June 1849 he added that a ‘very large proportion\r\nof the Median characters can be identified with Assyrio-Babylonian\r\ncharacters, having nearly the same phonetic values’ (xxii. 4).\r\nWestergaard thought the writing originated in Babylon, ‘whence it spread\r\nin two branches, eastward to Susiana and northward to the Assyrian\r\nEmpire, from whence it passed to Media, and last to ancient Persis’ (p.\r\n273, Copenhagen edition). He thought the Median bore most resemblance to\r\nAssyrian writing, and Persian to Babylonian writing (_ib._ p. 272; _cf._\r\nBonn edition, p. 4).\r\n\r\n[648] Copenhagen ed. p. 271.\r\n\r\n[649] Weisbach, p. 7; Mohl, _Vingt-sept ans d’Etudes_, i. 419;\r\n_Athenæum_, July 6 and September 7, 1850. _Cf._ above, p. 194.\r\n\r\n[650] Holtzman’s essays appeared in the _Zeitschrift D.M.G._ between 1851\r\nand 1854.

Oppert claims to have suggested in 1847 that Median belongs to\r\nthe ‘Finno-ouralienne’ race (_Expédition_, p. 82). He has not given any\r\nreference, and we know of no writing of his of that date except the tract\r\nalready reviewed: and this opinion does not appear to be stated there.\r\n\r\n[661] Cf. _J. R. A.

Oppert cannot always be taken seriously where his own claims are\r\nconcerned. Writing in 1859, he says of the Median: ‘Tous nos devanciers,\r\ny compris M. Norris, l’ont prise pour une écriture distincte de celle\r\ndes Assyriens’ (p. 71). Leaving out of account Norris’s identification\r\nof 47 of the characters, De Saulcy had pronounced them to be ‘identical’\r\nin 1848.

In this case, however, it is so. Hincks\r\nafterwards instanced _an_, which, followed by _ac_, he reads, not ‘anac,’\r\nbut ‘nabu.’ _Athenæum_, Sept. 21, 1850.\r\n\r\n[812] He explained this matter with great clearness in 1850, when he\r\nshowed that the sign for _an_ is used (1) as a simple phonograph in some\r\nwords, as in ‘zarangu’; (2) elsewhere it occurs alone as an independent\r\nideograph for ‘god,’ and forms the plural ‘gods’ by the mere addition of\r\nthe plural sign. (3) Again, it is found before the proper names of gods,\r\nas before Aurmuzd. Here the name is phonetically complete without it,\r\nand it is therefore simply a non-phonetic determinative. (4) Elsewhere\r\nit forms part of a compound ideograph, and may entirely change its\r\nphonetic value; and (5) it may be used ideographically for ‘god’ in\r\nSemitic proper names, where its value is not _an_ but _ilu_, or sometimes\r\n_Assur_.—_Transactions_, ib. pp. 27-30; _Athenæum_, _ib._\r\n\r\n[813] He admits in Sept. 1850 that he had not yet seen Longpérier’s paper\r\n(_Athenæum_, Sept. 21, 1850).\r\n\r\n[814] He explained, however, that his short a corresponds to the Greek\r\nepsilon (_Transactions_, p. 10). In his list the consonants followed\r\nby _ā_ are really those followed by _a_, and those followed by _a_\r\ncorrespond to the consonants followed by _i_. His view of the four vowels\r\ndates from the paper on Van, Dec. 1847 (_J. R. A. S._ 1848, vol. ix.).\r\n\r\n[815] _Athenæum_, Aug. 24, 1850, p. 908.\r\n\r\n[816] _Essai de Déchiffrement_, p. 11; cf. _Journal Asiatique_, 1848, xi.\r\n246.\r\n\r\n[817] Thus Löwenstern, writing in 1847, before the third column was\r\ntaken, says: ‘Rawlinson a, durant nombre d’années, interdit au public\r\nsavant la vue des trésors dont il s’était réservé de faire un usage si\r\nutile à sa gloire.’—_Exposé_, p. 10.\r\n\r\n[818] _J.

The greater part, if not the whole of\r\nthe Obelisk inscription was translated before the publication of Layard’s\r\nbook in 1849.

The translator is Father Scheil, who has not thought it worth\r\nwhile to mention the name of his great predecessor. From what he says the\r\nreader might suppose the inscription was first translated by Oppert (p.\r\n37).\r\n\r\n[825] He thought the dynasty of Nimrud flourished B.C. 1300-1200, and the\r\nlater dynasty of Khorsabad from B.C. 1100-1000. _J.

Acad._ xxii. 56.\r\n\r\n[828] The report of his lecture, given in the _Athenæum_, leaves no\r\ndoubt on this point. It says: ‘Major Rawlinson could not admit that the\r\nphonetic system was entirely syllabic, as had been sometimes stated.\r\nThere was no doubt an extensive syllabarium, and the literal characters,\r\nmoreover, required a vowel-sound either to precede or follow the\r\nconsonant: _but such vowel sound was rarely uniform_. He preferred,\r\ntherefore, distinguishing the literal signs as sonant and complemental,\r\n_and leaving the vowels to be supplied according to the requirements of\r\nthe language_’ (_Athenæum_, March 2, 1850). And in August of the same\r\nyear he vindicated the use of _bona fide_ letters, in opposition to\r\nHincks, who maintained that ‘the characters had all definite syllabic\r\nvalues’ (_Athenæum_, Aug. 24, 1850).\r\n\r\n[829] For example, he describes the signs for _ut_ and _ti_ as _t_; for\r\n_bu_ and _bil_ as _b_; for _la_ and _li_ as _l_; _su_ as _s_, and _ku_ as\r\n_k_ (_J. R. A. S._ xii. 405, 406, 424, 433). Hincks already knew that the\r\nsigns indicated _ti_, _bu_, _la_, _li_ and _ku_.\r\n\r\n[830] Cf. _J. R. A. S._ xii. 413, xiv. p. xi.\r\n\r\n[831] Hincks, _Trans.

Plate 1; for De\r\nSaulcy, _Journal Asiatique_, 1854, iii. 95; for Bezold, _Die\r\nAchämenideninschriften_, p. 24.\r\n\r\n[839] The sign for ‘king’ was written ‘melik,’ after the Hebrew, till it\r\nwas seen that the Assyrians pronounced it ‘sarru’ (Menant, _Manuel_, p.\r\n265). In Rawlinson’s analysis he points out that one of the terms for\r\n‘king’ was certainly ‘sarru,’ as in the Window inscription of Darius at\r\nPersepolis and also at Khorsabad. ‘This discovery,’ he adds, ‘of course\r\ntends to discredit the reading of “melik,” and to suggest the uniform\r\nadoption of “sarru”’ (_J. R. A. S._ xiv. p. iii, _note_). The discovery\r\nwas made by Longpérier in 1847, and he gives the Hebrew equivalent\r\n(_Revue Archéologique_, 1848, Longpérier to Löwenstern, Sept. 1847, p.\r\n503). Oppert assigns the credit to De Saulcy (_Journal Asiatique_, 1857,\r\nix. 142), who mentions it in 1849. Hincks seems to have been the first to\r\nsuggest ‘melik’ or ‘malek’ (1849). ‘On Khorsabad,’ _Trans. R. I.
