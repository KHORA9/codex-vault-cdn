The history of the City is so many-sided that writers have to\r\nbe content with the study of some particular phase or some special epoch.\r\nThus we have those who have concentrated their efforts to evolving out of\r\nthe remote past the municipal organization of the City. Their task has\r\nbeen to unfold the origin and institution of the Mayoralty and Shrievalty\r\nof London, the division of the City into wards with Aldermen at their\r\nhead, the development of the various trade and craft guilds, and the\r\nrespective powers and duties of the Courts of Aldermen and Common Council,\r\nand of the Livery of London assembled in their Common Hall. Others have\r\ndevoted themselves to the study of the ecclesiastical and monastic side of\r\nthe City's history--its Cathedral, its religious houses, and hundred and\r\nmore parish churches, which occupied so large an extent of the City's\r\narea. The ecclesiastical importance of the City, however, is too often\r\nignored. \"We are prone,\" writes Bishop Stubbs, \"in examining into the\r\nmunicipal and mercantile history of London, to forget that it was a very\r\ngreat ecclesiastical centre.\" Others, again, have confined themselves to\r\ndepicting the every-day life of the City burgess, his social condition,\r\nhis commercial pursuits, his amusements; whilst others have been content\r\nto perpetuate the memory of streets and houses long since lost to the eye,\r\nand thus to keep alive an interest in scenes and places which otherwise\r\nwould be forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe political aspect of the City's history has rarely been touched by\r\nwriters, and yet its geographical position combined with the innate\r\ncourage and enterprise of its citizens served to give it no small\r\npolitical power and no insignificant place in the history of the Kingdom.\r\nThis being the case, the Corporation resolved to fill the void, and in\r\nview of the year 1889 being the 700th Anniversary of the Mayoralty of\r\nLondon--according to popular tradition--instructed the Library Committee to\r\nprepare a work showing \"the pre-eminent position occupied by the City of\r\nLondon and the important function it exercised in the shaping and making\r\nof England.\"\r\n\r\nIt is in accordance with these instructions that this and succeeding\r\nvolumes have been compiled. As the title of the work has been taken from a\r\nchapter in Mr. Loftie's book on London (\"Historic Towns\" series, chap.\r\nix), so its main features are delineated in that chapter. \"It would be\r\ninteresting\"--writes Mr. Loftie--\"to go over all the recorded instances in\r\nwhich the City of London interfered directly in the affairs of the\r\nKingdom. Such a survey would be the history of England as seen from the\r\nwindows of the Guildhall.\" No words could better describe the character of\r\nthe work now submitted to the public. It has been compiled mainly from the\r\nCity's own archives. The City has been allowed to tell its own story. If,\r\ntherefore, its pages should appear to be too much taken up with accounts\r\nof loans advanced by the City to impecunious monarchs or with wearisome\r\nrepetition of calls for troops to be raised in the City for foreign\r\nservice, it is because the City's records of the day are chiefly if not\r\nwholly concerned with these matters. If, on the other hand, an event which\r\nmay be rightly deemed of national importance be here omitted, it is\r\nbecause the citizens were little affected thereby, and the City's records\r\nare almost, if not altogether, silent on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe work does not affect to be a critical history so much as a _chronique\r\npour servir_, to which the historical student may have recourse in order\r\nto learn what was the attitude taken up by the citizens of London at\r\nimportant crises in the nation's history. He will there see how, in the\r\ncontest between Stephen and the Empress Matilda, the City of London held\r\nas it were the balance; how it helped to overthrow the tyranny of\r\nLongchamp, and to wrest from the reluctant John the Great Charter of our\r\nliberties; how it was with men and money supplied by the City that Edward\r\nIII and Henry V were enabled to conquer France, and how in after years the\r\nLondon trained bands raised the siege of Gloucester and turned the tide of\r\nthe Civil War in favour of Parliament. He will not fail to note the\r\nsignificant fact that before Monk put into execution his plan for\r\nrestoring Charles II to the Crown, the taciturn general--little given to\r\nopening his mind to anyone--deemed it advisable to take up his abode in the\r\nCity in order to first test the feelings of the inhabitants as to whether\r\nthe Restoration would be acceptable to them or not. He will see that the\r\ncitizens of London have at times been bold of speech even in the presence\r\nof their sovereign when the cause of justice and the liberty of the\r\nsubject were at stake, and that they did not hesitate to suffer for their\r\nopinions; that, \"at many of the most critical periods of our history, the\r\ninfluence of London and its Lord Mayors has turned the scale in favour of\r\nthose liberties of which we are so justly proud\"; and that had the\r\nentreaties of the City been listened to by the King and his ministers, the\r\nAmerican Colonies would never have been lost to England.\r\n\r\nThere are two Appendices to the work; one comprising copies from the\r\nCity's Records of letters, early proclamations and documents of special\r\ninterest to which reference is made in the text; the other consisting of a\r\nmore complete list of the City's representatives in Parliament from the\r\nearliest times than has yet been printed, supplemented as it has been by\r\nreturns to writs recorded in the City's archives and (apparently) no where\r\nelse. The returns for the City in the Blue Books published in 1878 and\r\n1879 are very imperfect.\r\n\r\n                                                                  R. R.

The value of such a noble river as the Thames was scarcely\r\nover-estimated by the citizens when, as the story goes, they expressed to\r\nKing James their comparative indifference to his threatened removal of\r\nhimself, his court and parliament, from London, if only their river\r\nremained to them. The mouth of the Thames is the most convenient port on\r\nthe westernmost boundary of the European seaboard, and ships would often\r\nrun in to replenish their tanks with the sweet water for which it was once\r\nfamous.(1)\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of the Western Empire (A.D. 476), commercial enterprise\r\nsprang up among the free towns of Italy. The carrying trade of the world's\r\nmerchandise became centred for a time in Venice, and that town led the way\r\nin spreading the principles of commerce along the shores of the\r\nMediterranean, being closely followed by Genoa, Florence, and Pisa. The\r\ntide, which then set westward, and continued its course beyond the Pillars\r\nof Hercules, was met in later years by another stream of commerce from the\r\nshores of the Baltic.(2) Small wonder, then, if the City of London was\r\nquick to profit by the continuous stream of traffic passing and repassing\r\nits very door, and vindicated its title to be called--as the Venerable Bede\r\nhad in very early days called it the Emporium of the World.(3)\r\n\r\nBut if London's prosperity were solely due to its geographical position,\r\nwe should look for the same unrivalled pre-eminence in commerce in towns\r\nlike Liverpool or Bristol, which possess similar local advantages; whilst,\r\nif royal favour or court gaieties could make cities great, we should have\r\nsurely expected Winchester, Warwick, York, or Stafford to have outstripped\r\nLondon in political and commercial greatness, for these were the\r\nresidences of the rulers of Mercia, Northumbria, and Wessex, and the\r\nscenes of witena-gemots long before London could boast of similar favours.\r\nYet none of these equals London in extent, population, wealth, or\r\npolitical importance.\r\n\r\n(M2)\r\n\r\nWe must therefore look for other causes of London's pre-eminence, and\r\namong these, we may reckon the fact that the City has never been subject\r\nto any over-lord except the king. It never formed a portion of the king's\r\ndemesne (_dominium_), but has ever been held by its burgesses as tenants\r\n_in capite_ by burgage (free socage) tenure. Other towns like Bristol,\r\nPlymouth, Beverley, or Durham, were subject to over-lords, ecclesiastical\r\nor lay, in the person of archbishop, bishop, abbot, baron or peer of the\r\nrealm, who kept in their own hands many of the privileges which in the\r\nmore favoured City of London were enjoyed by the municipal authorities.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the twelfth century, the town of Leicester, for\r\ninstance, was divided into four parts, one of which was in the king's\r\ndemesne, whilst the rest were held by three distinct over-lords. In course\r\nof time, the whole of the shares fell into the hands of Count Robert of\r\nMeulan, who left the town in demesne to the Earls of Leicester and his\r\ndescendants; and to this day the borough bears on its shield the arms of\r\nthe Bellomonts.(4) The town of Birmingham is said, in like manner, to bear\r\nthe arms of the barons of that name; the town of Cardiff, those of the De\r\nClares; and Manchester, those of the Byrons. Instances might be\r\nmultiplied. But the arms of the City of London and of free boroughs, like\r\nWinchester, Oxford, and Exeter, are referable to no over-lord, although\r\nthe borough of Southwark still bears traces in its heraldic shield of its\r\nformer ecclesiastical connection.\r\n\r\n(M3)\r\n\r\nThe influence of an over-lord for good or evil, over those subject to his\r\nauthority, was immense. Take for instance, Sheffield, which was subject,\r\nin the reign of Elizabeth, to the Earl of Shrewsbury. The cutlery trade,\r\neven in those days, was the main-stay of the town, and yet the earl could\r\nmake and unmake the rules and ordinances which governed the Cutlers'\r\nCompany, and could claim one half of the fines imposed on its members.(5)\r\n\r\nWhen, during the reign of Charles II, nearly every municipal borough in\r\nthe kingdom was forced to surrender its charter to the king, the citizens\r\nof Durham surrendered theirs to the Bishop, who, to the intense horror of\r\na contemporary writer, reserved to himself and his successors in the See\r\nthe power of approving and confirming the mayor, aldermen, recorder, and\r\ncommon council of that city.(6)\r\n\r\n(M4)\r\n\r\nThe commercial greatness of London can be traced back to the time of the\r\nRoman occupation of Britain. From being little more than a stockaded fort,\r\nsituate at a point on the river's bank which admitted of an easy passage\r\nby ferry across to Southwark, London prospered under the protection\r\nafforded to its traders by the presence of the Roman legions, but it never\r\nin those days became the capital of the province. Although a flourishing\r\ncentre of commerce in the middle of the first century of the Christian\r\nera, it was not deemed of sufficient importance by Suetonius, the Roman\r\ngeneral, to run the risk of defending against Boadicea,(7) and although\r\nthought worthy of the title of Augusta--a name bestowed only on towns of\r\nexceptional standing--the Romans did not hesitate to leave both town and\r\nprovince to their fate as soon as danger threatened them nearer home.\r\n\r\n(M5)\r\n\r\nFor military no less than for commercial purposes--and the Roman occupation\r\nof Britain was mainly a military one--good roads were essential, and these\r\nthe Romans excelled in making. It is remarkable that in the Itinerary of\r\nAntoninus Pius, London figures either as the starting point or as the\r\nterminus to nearly one-half of the routes described in the portion\r\nrelating to Britain.(8) The name of one and only one of these Roman\r\nhighways survives in the city at the present day, and then only in its\r\nTeutonic and not Roman form--the Watling or \"Wathelinga\" Street, the street\r\nwhich led from Kent through the city of London to Chester and York, and\r\nthence by two branches to Carlisle and the neighbourhood of Newcastle. The\r\nErmin Street, another Roman road with a Teutonic name, led from London to\r\nLincoln, with branches to Doncaster and York, but its name no longer\r\nsurvives in the city.\r\n\r\n(M6)\r\n\r\nThe same reasons that led the Romans to establish good roads throughout\r\nthe country led them also to erect a bridge across the river from London\r\nto Southwark, and in later years to enclose the city with a wall. To the\r\nbuilding of the bridge, which probably took place in the early years of\r\nthe Roman occupation, London owed much of its youthful prosperity;\r\nwhenever any accident happened to the bridge the damage was always\r\npromptly repaired. Not so with the walls of the city. They were allowed to\r\nfall into decay until the prudence and military genius of the great Alfred\r\ncaused them to be repaired as a bulwark against the onslaughts of the\r\nDanes.\r\n\r\n(M7)\r\n\r\n\"Britain had been occupied by the Romans, but had not become Roman,\"(9)\r\nand the scanty and superficial civilization which the Britons had received\r\nfrom the Roman occupation was obliterated by the calamities which followed\r\nthe northern invasions of the fifth and following centuries. A Christian\r\ncity, as Augusta had probably been, not a vestige of a Christian church of\r\nthe Roman period has come down to us.(10) It quickly lapsed into paganism.\r\nIts very name disappears, and with it the names of its streets, its\r\ntraditions and its customs. Its inhabitants forgot the Latin tongue, and\r\nthe memories of 400 years were clean wiped out. There remains to us of the\r\npresent day nothing to remind us of London under the Roman empire, save a\r\nfragment of a wall, a milestone, a few coins and statuettes, and some\r\narticles of personal ornament or domestic use--little more in fact, than\r\nwhat may be seen in the Museum attached to the Guildhall Library. The long\r\nsubjection to Roman rule had one disastrous effect. It enervated the\r\npeople and left them powerless to cope with those enemies who, as soon as\r\nthe iron hand of the Roman legions was removed, came forth from their\r\nhiding places to harry the land.\r\n\r\n(M8)\r\n\r\nThus it was that when the Picts and Scots again broke loose from their\r\nnorthern fastnesses and threatened London as they had done before (A.D.\r\n368), they once more appealed for aid to the Roman emperor, by whose\r\nassistance the marauders had formerly been driven back. But times were\r\ndifferent in 446 to what they had been in 368. The Roman empire was itself\r\nthreatened with an invasion of the Goths, and the emperor had his hands\r\ntoo full to allow him to lend a favourable ear to the \"groans of the\r\nBritons.\"(11)\r\n\r\n(M9)\r\n\r\nCompelled to seek assistance elsewhere, the Britons invited a tribe of\r\nwarriors, ever ready to let their services for hire, from the North Sea,\r\nto lend them their aid. The foreigners came in answer to the invitation,\r\nthey saw, they conquered; and then they refused to leave an island the\r\nfertility of which they appreciated no less than they despised the\r\nslothfulness of its inhabitants.(12) They turned their weapons against\r\ntheir employers, and utterly routed them at Crayford, driving them to take\r\nrefuge within the walls of London.\r\n\r\n(M10)\r\n\r\n\"A.D. 457 (456). This year Hengist and AEsc [Eric or Ash] his son fought\r\nagainst the Britons at a place called Creegan-Ford [Crayford] and there\r\nslew four thousand men, and the Britons then forsook Kent, and in great\r\nterror fled to London.\"(13) So runs the Anglo-Saxon chronicle, and this is\r\nthe sole piece of information concerning London it vouchsafes us for one\r\nhundred and fifty years following the departure of the Romans. The\r\ninformation, scant as it is, serves to show that London had not quite\r\nbecome a deserted city, nor had yet been devastated as others had been by\r\nthe enemy. Its walls still served to afford shelter to the terrified\r\nrefugees.\r\n\r\n(M11)\r\n\r\nWhen next we read of her, she is in the possession of the East Saxons. How\r\nthey came there is a matter for conjecture. It is possible that with the\r\nwhole of the surrounding counties in the hands of the enemy, the Londoners\r\nwere driven from their city to seek means of subsistence elsewhere, and\r\nthat when the East Saxons took possession of it, they found houses and\r\nstreets deserted. Little relishing a life within a town, they probably did\r\nnot make a long stay, and, on their departure, the former inhabitants\r\nreturned and the city slowly recovered its wonted appearance, as the\r\ncountry around became more settled.\r\n\r\n(M12)\r\n\r\nChristianity in the country had revived, and London was now to receive its\r\nfirst bishop. It is the year 604. \"This year,\" writes the chronicler,\r\n\"Augustine hallowed two bishops, Mellitus and Justus; Mellitus he sent to\r\npreach baptism to the East Saxons, whose king was called Seberht, son of\r\nRicula, the sister of Ethelbert whom Ethelbert had there set as king. And\r\nEthelbert gave to Mellitus a bishop's see at London.\" This passage is\r\nremarkable for two reasons:--(1) as shewing us that London was at this time\r\nsituate in Essex, the kingdom of the East Saxons, and (2) that Seberht was\r\nbut a _roi faineant_, enjoying no real independence in spite of his\r\ndignity as ruler of the East Saxons and nominal master of London, his\r\nuncle Ethelbert, king of the Cantii, exercising a hegemony over \"all the\r\nnations of the English as far as the Humber.\" (14)\r\n\r\nHence it is that London is spoken of by some as being the _metropolis_ of\r\nthe East Saxons,(15) and by others as being the principal city of the\r\nCantii;(16) the fact being that, though locally situate in Essex, it was\r\ndeemed the political capital of that kingdom which for the time being\r\nhappened to be paramount.\r\n\r\n(M13)\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Seberht, the Londoners became dissatisfied with their\r\nbishop and drove him out. Mellitus became in course of time Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, whilst the Londoners again relapsed into paganism.(17) Not\r\nonly was the erection of a cathedral in the city due to Ethelbert, but it\r\nwas also at his instigation, if not with his treasure, that Seberht, the\r\n\"wealthy sub-king of London,\" was, as is believed, induced to found the\r\nAbbey of Westminster.(18)\r\n\r\n(M14)\r\n\r\nWhen the Saxon kingdoms became united under Egbert and he became _rex\r\ntotius Britanniae_ (A.D. 827), London began to take a more prominent place\r\namong the cities of the kingdom, notwithstanding its having been three\r\ntimes destroyed by fire between 674 and 801.(19) It became more often the\r\nseat of the royal residence, and the scene of witena-gemots; nevertheless\r\nit was not the seat of government, much less the capital. Then and for a\r\nlong time to come it had a formidable rival in Winchester, the chief town\r\nof Egbert's own kingdom of Wessex. To Winchester that king proceeded in\r\ntriumph after completing the union of the Saxon kingdoms, and thither he\r\nsummoned his vassals to hear himself proclaimed their overlord. From\r\nWinchester, Alfred, too, promulgated his new code of Wessex law--a part of\r\nthe famous _Domboc_, a copy of which is said to have been at one time\r\npreserved among the archives of the City of London(20)--and the Easter\r\ngemot, no matter where the other gemots of the year were held, was nearly\r\nalways held at Winchester. When it came to a question of trade regulation,\r\nthen London took precedence of Winchester. \"Let one measure and one weight\r\npass, such as is observed at London and at Winchester,\"(21) enacted King\r\nEdgar, whose system of legislation was marked with so much success that\r\n\"Edgar's Law\" was referred to by posterity as to the old constitution of\r\nthe realm.\r\n\r\n(M15)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the country had been invaded by a fresh enemy, and the\r\nsame atrocities which the Briton had suffered at the hands of the Saxon,\r\nthe Saxon was made to suffer at the hands of the Dane. London suffered\r\nwith the rest of the kingdom. In 839 we read of a \"great slaughter\"\r\nthere;(22) in 851 the city was in the hands of the enemy, and continued to\r\nremain at the mercy of the Danes, so much so, in fact, that in 872 we find\r\nthe Danish army taking up winter quarters within its walls, as in a city\r\nthat was their own.(23)\r\n\r\n(M16)\r\n\r\nIt was now, when the clouds were darkest, that Alfred, brother of King\r\nEthelred, appeared on the scene, and after more than one signal success by\r\nland and sea, concluded the treaty of Wedmore (A.D. 878)(24) by which a\r\nvast tract of land bounded by an imaginary line drawn from the Thames\r\nalong the river Lea to Bedford, and thence along the Roman Watling Street\r\nto the Welsh border, was ceded to the enemy under the name of _Danelagh_.\r\nThe treaty, although it curtailed the Kingdom of Wessex, and left London\r\nitself at the mercy of the Danes, was followed by a period of comparative\r\ntranquillity, which allowed Alfred time to make preparations for a fresh\r\nstruggle that was to wrest from the enemy the land they had won.\r\n\r\n(M17)\r\n\r\nThe Danes, like the Angles and the Jutes before them, set little store by\r\nfortifications and walled towns, preferring always to defend themselves by\r\ncombat in open field, and the Roman wall of the City was allowed to fall\r\nstill further into decay. In the eyes of Alfred on the other hand, London,\r\nwith its surrounding wall, was a place of the first importance, and one to\r\nbe acquired and kept at all hazards. At length he achieved the object of\r\nhis ambition and succeeded in driving out the Danes, (A.D. 883 or\r\n884).(25)\r\n\r\n(M18)\r\n\r\nWhilst the enemy directed their attention to further conquests in France\r\nand Belgium, Alfred bent his energies towards repairing the City walls and\r\nbuilding a citadel for his defence--\"the germ of that tower which was to be\r\nfirst the dwelling place of Kings, and then the scene of the martyrdom of\r\ntheir victims.\"(26) To his foresight in this respect was it due that the\r\ncity of London was never again taken by open assault, but successfully\r\nrepelled all attacks whilst the surrounding country was often devastated.\r\n\r\nNor did Alfred confine his attention solely to strengthening the city\r\nagainst attacks of enemies without or to making it more habitable. He also\r\nlaid the foundation of an internal Government analagous to that\r\nestablished in the Shires. Under the year A.D. 886, the Anglo-Saxon\r\nChronicle(27) records that \"King AElfred restored London; and all the Anglo\r\nrace turned to him that were not in bondage of the Danish men; and he then\r\ncommitted the burgh to \"the keeping of the aldorman AEthelred.\" In course\r\nof time the analogy between shire and city organization became more close.\r\nWhere the former had its Shiremote, the latter had its Folkmote, meeting\r\nin St. Paul's Churchyard by summons of the great bell. The County Court\r\nfound its co-relative in the Husting Court of the City; the Hundred Court\r\nin the City Wardmote.(28)\r\n\r\n(M19)\r\n\r\nFor the next ten years Alfred busied himself founding a navy and\r\nestablishing order in different parts of the country, but in 896 he was\r\ncompelled to hasten to London from the west of England to assist in the\r\nrepulse of another attack of the Danes. Two years before (894) the Danes\r\nhad threatened London, having established a fortification at Beamfleate or\r\nSouth Benfleet, in Essex, whence they harried the surrounding country. The\r\nLondoners on that occasion joined that part of the army which Alfred had\r\nleft behind in an attack upon the fort, which they not only succeeded in\r\ntaking, but they \"took all that there was within, as well money as women\r\nand children, and brought all to London; and all the ships they either\r\nbroke in pieces or burned, or brought to London or to Rochester.\"(29) Nor\r\nwas this all: Hasting's wife and his two sons had been made prisoners, but\r\nwere chivalrously restored by Alfred.\r\n\r\n(M20)\r\n\r\nThe Danes, however, were not to be daunted by defeat nor moved from their\r\npurpose by the generous conduct of Alfred. In 896 they again appeared.\r\nThis time they erected a work on the sea, twenty miles above London.\r\nAlfred made a reconnaissance and closed up the river so that they found it\r\nimpossible to bring out their ships.(30) They therefore abandoned their\r\nvessels and escaped across country, and \"the men of London\" writes the\r\nchronicler, \"brought away the ships, and all those which they could not\r\nbring off they broke up, and those that were _stalworth_ they brought into\r\nLondon.\"(31)\r\n\r\n(M21)\r\n\r\nThe principle of each man becoming responsible to the Government for the\r\ngood behaviour of the neighbour, involved in the system of frankpledge\r\nwhich Alfred established throughout the whole of his kingdom, subject to\r\nhis rule, was carried a step further by the citizens of London at a later\r\ndate. Under Athelstan (A.D. 925-940) we find them banding together and\r\nforming an association for mutual defence of life and property, and thus\r\nassisting the executive in the maintenance of law and order. A complete\r\ncode of ordinances, regulating this \"frith\" or peace gild, as it was\r\ncalled, drawn up by the bishops and reeves of the burgh, and confirmed by\r\nthe members on oath, is still preserved to us.(32)\r\n\r\n(M22)\r\n\r\nThe enactments are chiefly directed against thieves, the measures to be\r\ntaken to bring them to justice, and the penalties to be imposed on them,\r\nthe formation of a common fund for the pursuit of thieves, and for making\r\ngood to members any loss they may have sustained. So far, the gild\r\nundertook duties of a public character, such as are found incorporated\r\namong other laws of the kingdom, but it had, incidentally, also its social\r\nand religious side. When the ruling members met in their gild-hall,(33)\r\nwhich they did once a month, \"if they could and had leisure,\" they enjoyed\r\na refection with ale-drinking or \"byt-filling.\"\r\n\r\n(M23)\r\n\r\nSome writers see in the \"frith-gild\" of Athelstan's day, nothing more than\r\na mere \"friendly society,\" meeting together once a month, to drink their\r\nbeer and consult about matters of mutual insurance and other topics of\r\nmore or less social and religious character.(34) But there is evidence to\r\nshow that the tie which united members of a \"frith-gild\" was stronger and\r\nmore solemn than any which binds the members of a friendly society or\r\nvoluntary association. The punishment of one who was guilty of breaking\r\nhis \"frith\" was practically banishment or death. Such a one, in\r\nAthelstan's time, was ordered to abjure the country, which probably meant\r\nno more than that he was to leave his burgh or perhaps the shire in which\r\nhe dwelt, but if ever he returned, he might be treated as a thief taken\r\n\"hand-habbende\" or one taken with stolen goods upon him, in other words,\r\n\"with the mainour.\"(35) A thief so taken might lawfully be killed by the\r\nfirst man who met him, and the slayer was, according to the code of the\r\n\"frith-gild,\" \"to be twelve pence the better for the deed.\"(36) Under\r\nthese circumstances, it is more reasonable to suppose, that the\r\n\"frith-gild\" was not so much a voluntary association as one imposed upon\r\nmembers of the community by some public authority.(37)\r\n\r\n(M24)\r\n\r\nThe commercial supremacy of London, not only over Winchester but over\r\nevery other town in the kingdom, now becomes more distinct, for when\r\nAthelstan appointed moneyers or minters throughout the country, he\r\nassigned eight (the largest number of all) to London, whilst for\r\nWinchester he appointed only six, other towns being provided with but one\r\nor at most two.(38) The king, moreover, showed his predilection for London\r\nby erecting a mansion house for himself within the city's walls.\r\n\r\nThe encouragement which Athelstan gave to commercial enterprise by\r\nenacting, that any merchant who undertook successfully three voyages\r\nacross the high seas at his own cost (if not in his own vessel) should\r\nrank as a thane,(39) must have affected the London burgess more than those\r\nof any other town.\r\n\r\n(M25)\r\n\r\nUnder Ethelred II, surnamed the \"Unready\" or \"redeless\" from his\r\nindifference to the \"rede\" or council of his advisers, the city would\r\nagain have fallen into the hands of the Danes, but for the personal\r\ncourage displayed by its inhabitants and the protection which, by Alfred's\r\nforesight, the walls were able to afford them. In 994, Olaf and Sweyn\r\nsailed up the Thames with a large fleet and threatened to burn London.\r\nObstinate fighting took place, but the enemy, we are told, \"sustained more\r\nharm and evil than they ever deemed that any townsman could do to them,\r\nfor the Holy Mother of God, on that day, manifested her mercy to the\r\ntownsmen and delivered them from their foes.\"(40)\r\n\r\n(M26)\r\n\r\nMatters might not have been so bad had not the king already committed the\r\nfatal error of attempting to secure peace by buying off the enemy. In 991,\r\nhe had, with the consent of his witan, raised the sum of L10,000 with\r\nwhich he had bribed the Danish host. This was the origin of the tax known\r\nas Danegelt, which in after years became one of the chief financial\r\nresources of the Crown and continued almost uninterruptedly down to the\r\nreign of Henry II. The effect of the bribe was naturally enough to induce\r\nthe enemy to make further depredations whenever in want of money; and\r\naccordingly, a Danish fleet threatened London the very next year (992) and\r\nagain in 994. On this last occasion, the same wretched expedient was\r\nresorted to, and the Danes were again bought off.\r\n\r\n(M27)\r\n\r\nNor was cowardice the only charge of which Ethelred was guilty. To this\r\nmust be added treachery and murder. In the year 1002, when he married the\r\ndaughter of the Duke of Normandy, hoping thereby to win the Duke's\r\nfriendship and to close the harbours on the French coast against Sweyn,\r\nEthelred issued secret orders for a massacre of all Danes found in\r\nEngland. In this massacre, which took place on the Festival of St. Brice\r\n(13th Nov.), perished Gunhild, sister of Sweyn. Under these circumstances,\r\nit can scarcely be wondered at, that thenceforth the Danish invasions\r\nbecame more frequent, more systematic, and more extensive than ever.\r\n\r\nFor four years they continued their depredations \"cruelly marking every\r\nshire in Wessex with burning and with harrying.\" Then they were again\r\nbought off with a sum of L36,000, and two years' respite (1007-8) was\r\ngained.(41) It was a respite and no more. As soon as they had spent their\r\nmoney, they came again, and in 1009 made several assaults on London--\"They\r\noften fought against the town of London, but to God be praise that it yet\r\nstands sound, and they have ever fared ill.\"(42) Every year they struck\r\ndeeper into the heart of the country, and carried their plundering\r\nexpeditions from Wessex into Mercia and East Anglia.\r\n\r\n(M28)\r\n\r\nIn 1011 Canterbury was taken and sacked, Alphage, the Archbishop, being\r\nmade prisoner, and carried away by the Danish fleet to Greenwich. Finding\r\nit impossible to extort a ransom, they brutally murdered him (19th May,\r\n1012), in one of their drunken moods, pelting him in their open court or\r\n\"husting\" with bones and skulls of oxen.(43) The worthy prelate's corpse\r\nwas allowed to be removed to London where it was reverently interred in\r\nSt. Paul's. A few years later, Cnut caused it to be transferred with due\r\nsolemnity to the Archbishop's own metropolitan church of Canterbury.\r\n\r\n(M29)\r\n\r\nIn the following year, Sweyn was so successful in reducing the\r\nNorthumbrians and the inhabitants of the five boroughs,(44) as well as the\r\ntowns of Winchester and Oxford, taking hostages from each as he went, that\r\nhe thought he might venture once more to attack London itself; hoping for\r\nbetter success than had attended him on previous occasions. He was the\r\nmore anxious to capture London, because Ethelred himself was there, but he\r\nagain met with such determined resistance, and so many of his followers\r\nwere drowned in the Thames that for the fourth time he had to beat a\r\nretreat.(45)\r\n\r\n(M30)\r\n\r\nLeaving London for a while, Sweyn proceeded to conquer that part of\r\nEngland which still held out against him, and having accomplished his\r\npurpose, was again preparing to attack the one city which had baffled all\r\nhis attempts to capture, when the Londoners themselves, finding further\r\nopposition hopeless, offered their submission and left Ethelred to take\r\ncare of himself.(46) This he did by betaking himself to Normandy, where he\r\nremained until Sweyn's death in the following year (3rd Feb., 1014).\r\n\r\n(M31)\r\n\r\nUpon this event taking place, the crews of the Danish fleet assumed the\r\nright of disposing of the English crown, and elected Sweyn's son, Cnut, to\r\nbe king. The English, however, compelled as they had been by superior\r\nstrength to submit to the father, were in no mood to accept without a\r\nstruggle the sovereignty of his son. The whole of the Witan at once\r\ndeclared in favour of sending for Ethelred, with the assurance \"that no\r\nlord was dearer than their natural lord,\" if only he would promise to\r\ngovern them more justly than before.(47) Ethelred sent word by Edmund his\r\nson that \"he would be to them a kind lord, and amend all the things which\r\nthey eschewed, and all the things should be forgiven which had been done\r\nor said to him, on condition that they all, unanimously and without\r\ntreachery, would turn to him.\" Pledges were given and taken on either\r\nside, and thenceforth a Danish king was to be looked upon as an\r\noutlaw.(48)\r\n\r\n(M32)\r\n\r\nWhen Ethelred arrived in England, he was accompanied according to an\r\nIcelandic Saga,(49) by King Olaf, of Norway, who assisted him in expelling\r\nthe Danes from Southwark, and gaining an entrance into the city. The\r\nmanner in which this was carried out, is thus described. A small knot of\r\nDanes occupied a stronghold in the City, whilst others were in possession\r\nof Southwark. Between the two lay London Bridge--a wooden bridge, \"so broad\r\nthat two waggons could pass each other upon it\"--fortified by barricades,\r\ntowers, and parapets, and manned by Danes. Ethelred was naturally very\r\nanxious to get possession of the bridge, and a meeting of chiefs was\r\nsummoned to consult how it could be done. Olaf promised to lay his fleet\r\nalongside the bridge if the English would do the same. This was agreed\r\nupon. Having covered in the decks of the vessels with a wooden roof to\r\nprotect the crew and fighting men, Olaf succeeded in rowing light up to\r\nthe bridge and laying cables round its piers. This done, he caused his\r\nships to head down stream and the crews to row their hardest. The result\r\nwas that the piles were loosened and the bridge, heavily weighted by the\r\nDanes who were fighting upon it, gave way. Many were thrown into the\r\nriver, whilst others made good their retreat to Southwark, which was soon\r\nafterwards stormed and taken. This incident in connection with Ethelred's\r\nreturn formed the subject of more than one Scandinavian poem, of which the\r\nfollowing may serve as a specimen:--\r\n\r\n  \"London Bridge is broken down--\r\n  Gold is won and bright renown.\r\n    Shields resounding,\r\n    War-horns sounding,\r\n  Hildur shouting in the din!\r\n    Arrows singing,\r\n    Mail-coats ringing--\r\n  Odin makes our Olaf win!\"\r\n\r\n(M33)\r\n\r\nFor a short while after his return Ethelred displayed a spirit of\r\npatriotism and courage beyond any he had hitherto shown. He succeeded in\r\nsurprising and defeating the Danes in that district of Lincolnshire known\r\nas Lindsey, and drove Cnut to take refuge in his ships, and eventually to\r\nsail away to Denmark.(50)\r\n\r\n(M34)\r\n\r\nIt was not long before he again appeared; he was then, however, to meet in\r\nthe field Ethelred's son, Edmund, whose valour had gained for him the name\r\nof Ironside. This spirited youth, forming a striking contrast to the weak\r\nand pusillanimous character of his father, had collected a force to\r\nwithstand the enemy, but the men refused to fight unless Ethelred came\r\nwith them, and unless they had \"the support of the citizens of\r\nLondon.\"(51) A message was therefore sent to him at London to take the\r\nfield with such a force as he could gather. Father and son thereupon\r\njoined forces; but the king was in ill-health, and it wanted but a whisper\r\nof treachery to send him back to the security of London's walls. Thither,\r\ntoo, marched Cnut, but before he arrived Ethelred had died (23rd April,\r\n1016).(52) The late king was buried in St. Paul's.(53)\r\n\r\n(M35)\r\n\r\nThe city of London had by this time attained a position higher than it had\r\never reached before. \"We cannot as yet call it the capital of the kingdom,\r\nbut its geographical position made one of the chief bulwarks of the land,\r\nand in no part of the realm do we find the inhabitants outdoing the\r\npatriotism and courage of its valiant citizens.\"(54) Under Edgar the\r\nforeign trade with the city had increased to such an extent that Ethelred,\r\nhis son, deemed it time to draw up a code of laws to regulate the customs\r\nto be paid by the merchants of France and Flanders as well as by the\r\n\"emperor's men,\" the fore-runners of those \"easterling\" merchants, who,\r\nfrom their headquarters in the Steel-yard at Dowgate, subsequently became\r\nknown as merchants of the Steel-yard.(55)\r\n\r\nAmong the multitude of foreigners that in after-years thronged the streets\r\nof the city bartering pepper and spices from the far east, gloves and\r\ncloth, vinegar and wine, in exchange for the rural products of the\r\ncountry, might be seen the now much hated but afterwards much favoured\r\nDane.(56) The Dane was again master of all England, except London, and\r\nEthelred's kingdom, before the close of his reign, was confined within the\r\nnarrow limits of the city's walls; \"that true-hearted city was once more\r\nthe bulwark of England, the centre of every patriotic hope, the special\r\nobject of every hostile attack.\"(57)\r\n\r\n(M36)\r\n\r\nAt Ethelred's death the Witan who were in London united with the\r\ninhabitants of the city in choosing Edmund as his successor. This is the\r\nfirst recorded instance of the Londoners having taken a direct part in the\r\nelection of a king. Cnut disputed Edmund's right to the crown, and\r\nproceeded to attack the city. He sailed up the Thames with his fleet, but\r\nbeing unable to pass the bridge, he dug a canal on the south side of the\r\nriver, whereby he was enabled to carry his ships above bridge, and so\r\ninvest the city along the whole length of the riverside. To complete the\r\ninvestment, and so prevent any of the inhabitants escaping either by land\r\nor water, he ditched the city round, so that none could pass in or\r\nout.(58)\r\n\r\n(M37)\r\n\r\nThis, as well as two other attempts made by Cnut within a few weeks of\r\neach other to capture London by siege, were frustrated by the determined\r\nopposition of the citizens.(59) \"Almighty God saved it,\" as the chronicler\r\npiously remarks.(60)\r\n\r\n(M38)\r\n\r\nNor was Cnut more successful in the field, being worsted in no less than\r\nfive pitched battles against Edmund, until by the treachery of Edmund's\r\nbrother-in-law, Eadric, alderman of Mercia, he succeeded at last in\r\nvanquishing the English army on the memorable field of Assandun.(61)\r\n\r\n(M39)\r\n\r\nAfter this Edmund reluctantly consented to a conference and a division of\r\nthe kingdom. The meeting took place at Olney, and there it was agreed that\r\nEdmund should retain his crown, and rule over all England south of the\r\nThames, together with East Anglia, Essex and London, whilst Cnut should\r\nenjoy the rest of the kingdom. \"The citizens, beneath whose walls the\r\npower of Cnut and his father had been so often shattered, now made peace\r\nwith the Danish host. As usual, money was paid to them, and they were\r\nallowed to winter as friends within the unconquered city.\"(62)\r\n\r\n(M40)\r\n\r\nThe partition of the kingdom between Edmund and Cnut had scarcely been\r\nagreed upon before the former unexpectedly died (30th Nov., 1016) and Cnut\r\nbecame master of London and king of all England. His rule was mild,\r\nbeneficent and just, recognising no distinction between Dane and\r\nEnglishman, and throughout his long reign of nearly twenty years the\r\ncitizens of London enjoyed that perfect peace so necessary for the\r\nsuccessful exercise of their commercial pursuits.\r\n\r\n(M41)\r\n\r\nAt the election of Cnut's successor which took place at Oxford in 1035,\r\nthe Londoners again played an important part. This time, however, it was\r\nnot the \"burhwaru or burgesses\" of the City who attended the gemot which\r\nhad been summoned for the purpose of election, but \"lithsmen\" of London.\r\n\r\n(M42)\r\n\r\nAs to who these \"lithsmen\" were, and how they came to represent the City\r\n(if indeed they represented the City at all) on this important occasion\r\nmuch controversy has arisen. To some they appear as nothing more than the\r\n\"nautic multitude\" or \"sea-faring men\" of London.(63) On the other hand,\r\nthere are those who hold that they were merchants who had achieved thane\r\nright under the provisions of Athelstan's day already mentioned;(64)\r\nwhilst there are still others who are inclined to look upon them as so\r\nmany commercial travellers who had made their way to Oxford by river in\r\nthe ordinary course of business, and who happened by good fortune to have\r\nbeen in that city at the time of a great political crisis.(65) The truth\r\nprobably lies somewhere between these extremes. The \"lithsmen\" may not\r\nthemselves have been thanes, although they are recorded as having been at\r\nOxford with almost all the thanes north of the Thames;(66) but that they\r\nwere something more than mere watermen, such as we shall see joining with\r\nthe apprentices of London at important political crises, and that they\r\nwere acting more or less as representatives of the Londoners who had\r\nalready acquired a predominant voice in such matters, seems beyond doubt.\r\n\r\n(M43)\r\n\r\nDuring the next thirty years London took no prominent part in the affairs\r\nof the country, content if only allowed to have leisure to mind its own\r\nbusiness. The desire for peace is the key-note to the action of the\r\ncitizens of London at every important crisis. Without peace, commerce\r\nbecame paralyzed. Peace could be best secured by a strong government, and\r\nsuch a government, whether in the person of a king or protector could\r\ncount upon their support. \"For it they were ready to devote their money\r\nand their lives, for commerce, the child of opportunity, brought wealth;\r\nwealth power; and power led independence in its train.\" The quarrels of\r\nthe half-brothers, Harold and Harthacnut, the attempt by one or both of\r\nthe sons of Ethelred and Emma to recover their father's kingdom, and the\r\nquestion of the innocence or guilt of Earl Godwine in connection with the\r\nmurder of one of them, affected the citizens of London only so far as such\r\ndisturbances were likely to impede the traffic of the Thames or to make it\r\ndangerous for them to convey their merchandise along the highways of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n(M44)\r\n\r\nThe payment of Danegelt at the accession of Harthacnut (A.D. 1040),(67)\r\nprobably touched the feelings, as it certainly did the pockets, of the\r\nLondoners, more than any other event which happened during this period.\r\n\r\n(M45)\r\n\r\nUpon the sudden death of Harthacnut (A.D. 1042), who died in a fit \"as he\r\nstood at his drink,\"(68) the choice of the whole nation fell on Edward,\r\nhis half-brother--\"before the king buried were, all folk chose Edward to\r\nking at London.\"(69) The share that the Londoners took in this particular\r\nelection is not so clear as in other cases. Nevertheless, the importance\r\nof the citizens was daily growing, and by the time of the accession of\r\nEdward the Confessor, the City was recognised as the capital of the\r\nkingdom, the chief seat for the administration of the law, and the place\r\nwhere the king usually resided.(70)\r\n\r\n(M46)\r\n\r\nIn early Saxon times the witan had met in any town where the king happened\r\nat the time to be; and although theoretically every freeman had a right to\r\nattend its meetings, practically the citizens of the town wherein the\r\ngemot happened at the time to be held, enjoyed an advantage over freemen\r\ncoming from a distance. Alfred ordained that the witan should meet in\r\nLondon for purposes of legislation twice a year.(71) Athelstan, Edmund and\r\nEdgar had held gemots in London, the last mentioned king holding a great\r\ngemot (_mycel gemot_) in St. Paul's Church in 973.\r\n\r\n(M47)\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Edward the Confessor, at least six meetings of the\r\nwitan took place in London; the more important of these being held in 1051\r\nand the following year. By the gemot of 1051, which partook of the nature\r\nof a court-martial, Earl Godwine was condemned to banishment; but before a\r\ntwelve-month had elapsed, he was welcomed back at a great assembly or\r\n_mycel gemot_ held in the open air without the walls of London.(72) The\r\nnation had become disatisfied owing to the king's increasing favour to\r\nNorman strangers, but the earl desired to learn how stood the City of\r\nLondon towards him, and for this purpose made a stay at Southwark. He was\r\nsoon satisfied on this point. \"The townsfolk of the great city were not a\r\nwhit behind their brethren of Kent and Sussex in their zeal for the\r\nnational cause. The spirit which had beaten back Swend and Cnut, the\r\nspirit which was in after times to make London ever the stronghold of\r\nEnglish freedom, the spirit which made its citizens foremost in the\r\npatriot armies alike of the thirteenth and of the seventeenth centuries,\r\nwas now as warm in the hearts of those gallant burghers as in any earlier\r\nor later age. With a voice all but unanimous, the citizens declared in\r\nfavour of the deliverer; a few votes only, the votes, it may be, of\r\nstrangers or of courtiers, were given against the emphatic resolution,\r\nthat what the earl would the city would.\"(73) Having secured the favour of\r\nLondon his cause was secure. That the citizens heartily welcomed the earl,\r\ngoing forth in a body to meet him on his arrival, we learn also from\r\nanother source;(74) although, one at least of the ancient chroniclers\r\nstrongly hints that the favour of the citizens had been obtained by bribes\r\nand promises.(75) The earl's return was marked by decrees of outlawry\r\nagainst the king's foreign favourites, whose malign influence he had\r\nendeavoured formerly to counteract, and who had proved themselves strong\r\nenough to procure the banishment of himself and family.\r\n\r\n(M48)\r\n\r\nThe last gemot held under Edward was one specially summoned to meet at\r\nWestminster at the close of the year 1065, for the purpose of witnessing\r\nthe dedication of the new abbey church which the king loved so well and to\r\nwhich his remains were so shortly afterwards to be carried.\r\n\r\n(M49)\r\n\r\nHe died at the opening of the year, and the same witan who had attended\r\nhis obsequies elected Harold, the late Earl Godwine's son, as his\r\nsuccessor. This election, however, was doomed to be overthrown by the\r\npowerful sword of William the Norman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(M50)\r\n\r\nAs soon as the news of Harold's coronation reached William of Normandy, he\r\nclaimed the crown which Edward the Confessor had promised him. According\r\nto every principle of succession recognised in England, at the time, he\r\nhad no right to the crown whatever. When the Norman invader landed at\r\nPevensey, Harold was at York, having recently succeeded in defeating his\r\nbrother Tostig, the deposed Earl of Northumbria, who, with the assistance\r\nof Harold Hardrada, had attacked the northern earls, Edwine and Morkere.\r\nOn hearing of the Duke's landing, Harold hastened to London. A general\r\nmuster of forces was there ordered, and Edwine and Morkere, who were bound\r\nto Harold by family tie--the King having married their sister--were bidden\r\nto march southward with the whole force of their earldoms. But neither\r\ngratitude for their late deliverance at the hands of their brother-in-law,\r\nnor family affection, could hurry the steps of these earls, and they\r\narrived too late. The battle of Senlac, better known as the battle of\r\nHastings, had been won and lost (14th Oct., 1066), the Norman was\r\nconqueror, and Harold had perished. For a second time within twelve months\r\nthe English throne was vacant.(76)\r\n\r\nThe times were too critical to hold a formal gemot for the election of a\r\nsuccessor to the throne; but the citizens of London and the sailors or\r\n\"butsecarls\" (whom it is difficult not to associate with the \"lithsmen\" of\r\nformer days) showed a marked predilection in favour of Edgar the Atheling,\r\ngrandson of Edmund Ironside, and the sole survivor of the old royal line.\r\nThe Archbishop, too, as well as the northern earls, were in his favour,\r\nbut the latter soon withdrew to their respective earldoms and left London\r\nand the Atheling to their fate.(77) Thus, \"the patriotic zeal of the men\r\nof London was thwarted by the base secession of the northern traitors.\"\r\n\r\n(M51)\r\n\r\nAfter waiting awhile at Hastings for the country to make voluntary\r\nsubmission, and finding that homagers did not come in, William proceeded\r\nto make a further display of force. In this he betrayed no haste, but made\r\nhis way through Kent in leisurely fashion, receiving on his way the\r\nsubmission of Winchester and Canterbury, using no more force than was\r\nabsolutely necessary, and endeavouring to allay all fears, until at length\r\nhe reached the suburbs of London.(78)\r\n\r\nHe had been astute enough to give out that he came not to claim a crown,\r\nbut only a right to be put in nomination for it. To the mind of the\r\nLondoner, such quibbling failed to commend itself, and the citizens lost\r\nno time in putting their city into a posture of defence, determined not to\r\nsurrender it without a blow.\r\n\r\n(M52)\r\n\r\nUpon William's arrival in Southwark, the citizens sallied forth. They\r\nwere, however, beaten back after a sharp skirmish, and compelled to seek\r\nshelter again within their city's walls. William hesitated to make a\r\ndirect attack upon the city, but hoped by setting fire to Southwark to\r\nstrike terror into the inhabitants and bring them to a voluntary\r\nsurrender. He failed in his object; the city still held out, and William\r\nnext resorted to diplomacy.\r\n\r\n(M53)\r\n\r\nThe ruling spirit within the city at that time was Ansgar or Esegar the\r\n\"Staller\" under whom, as Sheriff of Middlesex, the citizens had marched\r\nout to fight around the royal standard at Hastings. He had been carried\r\nwounded from the field, and was now borne hither and thither on a litter,\r\nencouraging the citizens to make a stout defence of their city. To him, it\r\nis said, William sent a private message from Berkhampstead, asking only\r\nthat the Conqueror's right to the crown of England might be acknowledged\r\nand nothing more, the real power of the kingdom might remain with Ansgar\r\nif he so willed. Determined not to be outwitted by the Norman, Ansgar (so\r\nthe story goes) summoned a meeting of the eldermen (_natu majores_) of the\r\nCity--the forerunners of the later aldermen--and proposed a feigned\r\nsubmission which might stave off immediate danger. The proposal was\r\naccepted and a messenger despatched. William pretended to accept the terms\r\noffered, and at the same time so worked upon the messenger with fair\r\npromises and gifts that on his return he converted his fellow citizens and\r\ninduced them by representations of the Conqueror's friendly intentions and\r\nof the hopelessness of resistance, to make their submission to him, and to\r\nthrow over the young Atheling.\r\n\r\n(M54)\r\n\r\nWhatever poetic tinge there may be about the story as told by Guy of\r\nAmiens, it is certain that the citizens came to the same resolution, in\r\neffect, as that described by the poet, nor could they well have done\r\notherwise. The whole of the country for miles around London, had already\r\ntendered submission or been forced into it. The city had become completely\r\nisolated, and sooner or later its inhabitants must have been starved out.\r\nThere was, moreover, a strong foreign element within its walls.(79) Norman\r\nfollowers of Edward the Confessor were ever at hand to counsel submission.\r\nLondon submitted, the citizens accepting the rule of the Norman Conqueror\r\nas they had formerly accepted that of Cnut the Dane, \"from necessity.\" An\r\nembassy was despatched to Berkhampstead, comprising the Archbishop of\r\nYork, the young Atheling, the earls Edwine and Morkere, and \"all the best\r\nmen of London,\" to render homage and give hostages,(80) and thus it was,\r\nthat within three months of his landing, William was acknowledged as the\r\nlawfully elected King of England, and, as such, he crowned himself at\r\nWestminster, promising to govern the nation as well as any king before him\r\nif they would be faithful to him.\r\n\r\n(M55)\r\n\r\nThe conciliatory spirit of William towards the Londoners is seen in the\r\nfavourable terms he was ready to concede them. Soon after his coronation--\r\nthe precise date cannot be determined--he granted them a charter,(81) by\r\nwhich he clearly declared his purpose not to reduce the citizens to a\r\nstate of dependent vassalage, but to establish them in all the rights and\r\nprivileges they had hitherto enjoyed.\r\n\r\nThe charter, rendered into modern English, runs as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"William, King, greets William, Bishop, and Gosfregdh, Portreeve, and all\r\nthe burgesses within London, French and English, friendly. And I give you\r\nto know that I will that ye be all those laws worthy that ye were in King\r\nEadward's day.(82) And I will that every child be his father's heir after\r\nhis father's day and I will not suffer that any man offer you any wrong.\r\nGod keep you.\"\r\n\r\nThe terms of the charter are worthy of study. They are primarily\r\nremarkable as indicating that the City of London was, at the time, subject\r\nto a government which combined the secular authority of the port-reeve\r\nwith the ecclesiastical authority of the bishop. It was said, indeed, to\r\nhave been greatly due to the latter's intercession that the charter was\r\ngranted at all, and, in this belief, the mayor and aldermen were long\r\naccustomed to pay a solemn visit to the bishop's tomb in St. Paul's\r\nchurch, there to hear a _De profundis_ on the day when the new mayor took\r\nhis oath of office before the Barons of the Exchequer.(83)\r\n\r\n(M56)\r\n\r\nAs regards the port-reeve--the _port-gerefa_, _i.e._, reeve of the port or\r\ntown of London(84)--the nature and extent of his duties and authority, much\r\nuncertainty exists. Whilst, in many respects, his position in a borough\r\nwas analogous no doubt to the shire-reeve or sheriff of a county, there\r\nwere, on the other hand, duties belonging to and exercised by the one\r\nwhich were not exercised by the other. Thus, for instance, the port-reeve,\r\nunlike the sheriff, exercised no judicial functions in a criminal court,\r\nnor presided over court-leets in the city as the sheriff did in his county\r\nby _turn_, the latter being held independently by the alderman of each\r\nward.(85)\r\n\r\n(M57) (M58) (M59)\r\n\r\nIn the next place the charter brings prominently to our notice the fact\r\nthat there was already existing within the City's walls a strong Norman\r\nelement, existing side by side with the older English burgesses, which the\r\nConqueror did well not to ignore. The descendants of the foreign merchants\r\nfrom France and Normandy, for whose protection Ethelred had legislated\r\nmore than half a century before, had continued to carry on their\r\ncommercial intercourse with the Londoners, and were looking forward to a\r\nfreer interchange of merchandise now that the two countries were under one\r\nsovereign. Their expectation was justified. No sooner had London submitted\r\nto the Norman Conqueror than, we are told, \"many of the citizens of Rouen\r\nand Caen passed over thither, preferring to be dwellers in that city,\r\ninasmuch as it was fitter for their trading, and better stored with the\r\nmerchandise in which they were wont to traffic.\"(86) But by far the most\r\nimportant clause in the charter is that which places the citizens of\r\nLondon in the same position respecting the law of the land as they enjoyed\r\nin the days of their late king, Edward the Confessor. Here there is\r\ndistinct evidence that the Conqueror had come \"neither to destroy, nor to\r\nfound, but to continue.\"(87) The charter granted nothing new; it only\r\nratified and set the royal seal(88) to the rights and privileges of the\r\ncitizens already in existence.\r\n\r\n(M60)\r\n\r\nIt is recorded that William granted another charter to the citizens of\r\nLondon, vesting in them the City and Sheriffwick of London, and this\r\ncharter the citizens proffered as evidence of their rights over the\r\ncloister and church of St. Martin le Grand, when those rights were\r\nchallenged in the reign of Henry VI.(89) This charter has since been lost.\r\n\r\n(M61)\r\n\r\nThe compact thus made between London and the Conqueror was faithfully kept\r\nby both parties. Having ascended the English throne by the aid of the\r\ncitizens of London, William, unlike many of his successors, was careful\r\nnot to infringe the terms of their charter, whilst the citizens on the\r\nother hand continued loyal to their accepted king, and lent him assistance\r\nto put down insurgents in other parts of the kingdom. The fortress which\r\nWilliam erected within their city's walls did not disturb their\r\nequanimity. It was sufficient for them that, under the Conqueror's rule,\r\nthe country was once more peaceful, so peaceful that, according to the\r\nchronicler, a young maiden could travel the length of England without\r\nbeing injured or robbed.(90)\r\n\r\n(M62)\r\n\r\nThe close of the reign of William the First witnessed the completion of\r\n\"Doomsday,\" or survey of the kingdom, which he had ordered to be made for\r\nfiscal purposes. For some reason not explained, neither London nor\r\nWinchester--the two capitals, so to speak, of the kingdom--were included in\r\nthis survey. It may be that the importance of these boroughs, their wealth\r\nand population, necessitated some special method of procedure; but this\r\ndoes not account for the omission of Northumberland, Cumberland,\r\nWestmorland, and Durham, from the survey. We know that Winchester was\r\nafterwards surveyed, but no steps in the same direction were ever taken\r\nwith respect to London. The survey was not effected without disturbances,\r\nowing to the inquisitorial power vested in the commissioners appointed to\r\ncarry it out.\r\n\r\n(M63)\r\n\r\nWilliam died whilst on a visit to his duchy of Normandy, and \"he who was\r\nbefore a powerful king, and lord of many a land, had then of all his land,\r\nonly a portion of seven feet.\"(91) the same which, to this day, holds his\r\nmortal remains in the Abbey at Caen. He was succeeded by William his son.\r\nThe death of the father and accession of his son was marked by fire,\r\npestilence, and famine.(92)\r\n\r\n(M64)\r\n\r\nA fire destroyed St. Paul's and the greater part of the City. Maurice,\r\nBishop of London, at once set to work to rebuild the Cathedral on a larger\r\nand more magnificent scale, erecting the edifice upon arches in a manner\r\nlittle known in England at that time, but long practised in France. The\r\nNorman Conquest was already working for good. Not only the style of\r\narchitecture, but the very stone used in re-building St. Paul's came from\r\nFrance, the famous quarries of Caen being utilised for the purpose.(93)\r\n\r\nThere was already in the city, one church built after the same manner, and\r\non that account called St. Mary of Arches or \"le Bow.\"  The object of\r\nsetting churches and other buildings upon vaults was to guard against\r\nfire. Whatever defence against fire this method of building may have\r\nafforded, it was certainly no defence against wind. In 1091, the roof of\r\nSt. Mary-le-Bow was clean blown off, huge baulks of timber, 26 feet long,\r\nbeing driven into the ground with such force that scarce 4 feet of them\r\ncould be seen.(94)\r\n\r\n(M65)\r\n\r\nThe reign of the new king was one of oppression. Nevertheless, he\r\ncontinued to secure that protection for life and property which his father\r\nhad so successfully achieved, so that a man \"who had confidence in\r\nhimself\" and was \"aught,\" could travel the length and breadth of the land\r\nunhurt, \"with his bosom full of gold.\"(95) He also had an eye for the\r\nprotection of the city, and the advancement of its commerce, surrounding\r\nthe Tower of London by a wall, and repairing the bridge which had been\r\nnearly washed away by a flood.(96)\r\n\r\n(M66)\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd August, 1100, the Red King met his death suddenly in the New\r\nForest, and the next day was buried at Winchester. According to a previous\r\nagreement, the crown should have immediately devolved upon his brother\r\nRobert. Crowns, however, were not to be thus disposed of; they fell only\r\nto those ready and strong enough to seize them. Robert was far away on a\r\ncrusade. His younger brother Henry was on the spot, and upon him fell the\r\nchoice of such of the witan as happened to be in or near Winchester at the\r\ntime of the late king's death.(97)\r\n\r\n(M67)\r\n\r\nThe two days that elapsed before his coronation at Westminster (5th\r\nAugust), the king-elect spent in London, where by his easy and eloquent\r\nmanner, as well as by fair promises, he succeeded in winning the\r\ninhabitants over to his cause, to the rejection of the claims of Robert.\r\nThe election, or perhaps we should rather say, the selection of Henry by\r\nthe witan at Winchester, was thus approved and confirmed by the whole\r\nrealm (_regni universitas_), in the city of London.\r\n\r\nThe choice was made however on one condition, viz.:--that Henry should\r\nrestore to his subjects their ancient liberties and customs enjoyed in the\r\ndays of Edward the Confessor.(98) The charter thus obtained served as an\r\nexemplar for the great charter of liberties which was to be subsequently\r\nwrung from King John.\r\n\r\n(M68)\r\n\r\nAnother charter was granted by the new king--a charter to the citizens of\r\nLondon--granted, as some have thought, soon after his accession, and by way\r\nof recognition of the services they had rendered him towards obtaining the\r\ncrown. This however appears to be a mistake. There is reason for supposing\r\nthat this charter was not granted until at least thirty years after he was\r\nseated on the throne.(99)\r\n\r\n(M69)\r\n\r\nThe chief features of the grant(100) were that the citizens were\r\nthenceforth to be allowed to hold Middlesex to farm at a rent of L300 a\r\nyear, and to appoint from among themselves whom they would to be sheriff\r\nover it; they were further to be allowed to appoint their own justiciar to\r\nhold pleas of the crown, and no other justiciar should exercise authority\r\nover them; they were not to be forced to plead without the city's walls;\r\nthey were to be exempt from scot and lot and of all payments in respect of\r\nDanegelt and murder; they were to be allowed to purge themselves after the\r\nEnglish fashion of making oath and not after the Norman fashion by wager\r\nof battle; their goods were to be free of all manner of customs, toll,\r\npassage and lestage; their husting court might sit once a week; and\r\nlastly, they might resort to \"withernam\" or reprisal in cases where their\r\ngoods had been unlawfully seized.\r\n\r\n(M70)\r\n\r\nTouching the true import of this grant of Middlesex to the citizens at a\r\nyearly rent, with the right of appointing their own sheriff over it, no\r\nless than the identity of the justiciar whom they were to be allowed to\r\nchoose for themselves for the purpose of hearing pleas of the crown within\r\nthe city, much divergence of opinion exists. Some believe that the\r\ngovernment of the city was hereby separated from that of the shire wherein\r\nit was situate, and that the right of appointing their own justiciar which\r\nthe citizens obtained by this charter was the right of electing a sheriff\r\nfor the city of London in the place of the non-elective ancient\r\nport-reeve. Others deny that the charter introduced the shire organization\r\ninto the government of the city, and believe the justiciar and sheriff to\r\nhave been distinct officials.(101) The latter appear to hold the more\r\nplausible view. Putting aside the so-called charter of William the First,\r\ngranting to the citizens in express terms _civitatem et vice-comitatum\r\nLondoniae_, as wanting in corroboration, a solution of the difficulty may\r\nbe found if we consider (1) that the city received a shire organization\r\nand became in itself to all intents and purposes a county as soon as it\r\ncame to be governed by a port-reeve, if not as soon as an alderman had\r\nbeen set over it by Alfred; (2) that the duties of the shrievalty in\r\nrespect of the county of the city of London were at this time performed\r\neither by a port-reeve or by one or more officers, known subsequently as\r\nsheriffs, and (3) that for the right of executing these duties no rent or\r\nferm was ever demanded or paid.(102)\r\n\r\nIf this be a correct view of the matter, it would appear that the effect\r\nof Henry's grant of Middlesex to the citizens to farm, and of the\r\nappointment of a sheriff over it of their own choice, was not so much to\r\nrender the city independent of the shire, as to make the shire subject to\r\nthe city. It must be borne in mind that no sheriff (or sheriffs) has ever\r\nbeen elected by the citizens for Middlesex alone, the duties appertaining\r\nto the sheriff-wick of Middlesex having always been performed by the\r\nsheriffs of the city for the time being.(103) Hence it is that the\r\nshrievalty of London and Middlesex is often spoken of as the shrievalty of\r\n\"London\" alone, and the shrievalty of \"Middlesex\" alone (the same officers\r\nexecuting the duties of both shrievalties) and the _firma_ of L300 paid\r\nfor the shrievalty of Middlesex alone is sometimes described as the\r\n_firma_ of \"London,\" sometimes of \"Middlesex,\" and sometimes of \"London\r\nand Middlesex.\"(104)\r\n\r\n(M71)\r\n\r\nThe right of electing their own justiciar granted to the citizens by Henry\r\nresolves itself into little more than a confirmation of the right to elect\r\ntheir own sheriffs.(105) Just as sheriffs are known to have held pleas of\r\nthe crown in the counties up to the time of the Great Charter (although\r\ntheir duties were modified by Henry I, and again by Henry II, when he\r\nappointed Justices in eyre) so in the city of London, no one, except the\r\nsheriffs of London could hold pleas of the crown, and an attempt made by\r\nthe Barons in 1258 to introduce a justiciar into the Guildhall was\r\npersistently challenged by the citizens.(106)\r\n\r\nEven those who stedfastly maintain that in the country the sheriff and\r\njusticiar grew up to be two distinct officers, the one representing local\r\ninterest and the other imperial, are willing to allow that in the city of\r\nLondon such distinction was evanescent. The office of justiciar in the\r\ncity was twice granted _eo nomine_ to Geoffrey de Mandeville, Earl of\r\nEssex, and it is twice mentioned as having been held by one named Gervase,\r\nwho (there is reason to believe) is identical with Gervase de Cornhill, a\r\nSheriff of London in 1155 and 1156; but the office became extinct at the\r\naccession of Henry II.(107)\r\n\r\n(M72)\r\n\r\nThe events which followed Henry's decease afford us another instance of\r\nthe futility of all attempts at this early period to settle the succession\r\nto the crown before the throne was actually vacant. The King's nephew,\r\nStephen of Blois, and the nobility of England had sworn to accept the\r\nKing's daughter Matilda, wife of Geoffery of Anjou, as their sovereign on\r\nthe death of her father; yet when that event took place in 1135, Stephen,\r\nin spite of his oath, claimed the crown as nearest male heir of the\r\nConqueror's blood.(108)\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt of his popularity, whilst Matilda on the other hand\r\ninjured her cause by marrying an Angevin. On the continent a bitter feud\r\nexisted between Norman and Angevin; in England the Norman had steadily\r\nincreased in favour, and England's crown was Stephen's if he had courage\r\nenough to seize it.\r\n\r\nLanding on the Kentish coast, his first reception was far from\r\nencouraging. Canterbury and Dover, held by the Earl of Gloucester, refused\r\nto acknowledge him and closed their gates on his approach. Undismayed by\r\nthese rebuffs, Stephen pushed on to London, where he was welcomed by every\r\ntoken of good will. The Londoners had been no party to the agreement to\r\nrecognise Matilda as Henry's successor; they had become accustomed to\r\nexercising a right of sharing in the choice of a king who should reign\r\nover them, and they now chose Stephen. \"It was their right, their special\r\nprivilege,\" said they, \"on the occasion of the king's decease, to provide\r\nanother in his place.\"(109) There was no time to be lost, the country was\r\nin danger, Stephen was at hand, sent to them, as they believed, by the\r\ngoodness of Providence. They could not do better than elect him: and\r\nelected he was by the assembled aldermen or eldermen (_majores natu_) of\r\nthe City.\r\n\r\nSuch is the story of Stephen's election as given by the author of the\r\n\"Gesta Stephani,\" one who wrote as an eye-witness of what took place, but\r\nwhose statements cannot always be taken as those of an independent\r\nchronicler of events. Informal as this election may have been, it marks an\r\nimportant epoch in the annals of London. Thenceforth the city assumes a\r\npre-eminent position and exercises a predominant influence in the public\r\naffairs of the kingdom.(110)\r\n\r\n(M73)\r\n\r\nFrom London Stephen went down to Winchester, where he was heartily\r\nwelcomed by his brother Henry, recently appointed papal legate. Next to\r\nLondon, it was important that Stephen should secure Winchester, and now\r\nthat London had spoken, the citizens of Winchester no longer hesitated to\r\nthrow in their lot with the king. Winchester secured, and Stephen put in\r\npossession of the royal castle and treasury, he returned to London, where\r\nall doubts as to the validity or invalidity of his election were set at\r\nrest by the ceremony of coronation (Dec. 1135).\r\n\r\n(M74)\r\n\r\nIn the spring of the following year (April 1136), a brilliant council of\r\nthe clergy and magnates of the realm was held in London,(111) reminding\r\none of the Easter courts of the days of the Conqueror which latterly had\r\nbeen shorn of much of their splendour. The occasion was one for\r\nintroducing the new king to his subjects as well as for confirming the\r\nliberties of the church, and Stephen may have taken special care to\r\nsurround it with exceptional splendour as a set off against the meagreness\r\nwhich had characterised the recent ceremony of his coronation.(112)\r\n\r\n(M75)\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the injured Matilda appealed to Rome, but only with the\r\nresult that her rival received formal recognition from the Pope. Three\r\nyears later (1139) she landed in England accompanied by her brother, the\r\nEarl of Gloucester. She soon obtained a following, more especially in the\r\nwest; and Winchester--the seat of the royal residence of the queens of\r\nEngland since the time when Ethelred presented the city as a \"morning\r\ngift\" to his consort at their marriage--became her headquarters and\r\nrallying point for her supporters, whilst London served in the same way\r\nfor Stephen.\r\n\r\n(M76)\r\n\r\nAfter nine months of sieges and counter sieges, marches and counter\r\nmarches, in which neither party could claim any decided success, Stephen,\r\nas was his wont, withdrew to London and shut himself up in the Tower, with\r\nonly a single bishop, and he a foreigner, in his train. Whilst safe behind\r\nthe walls of that stronghold, negotiations were opened between him and the\r\nempress for a peaceful settlement of their respective claims (May, 1140),\r\nHenry of Winchester acting as intermediary between the rival parties.(113)\r\nThe negotiations ended without effecting the desired result.\r\n\r\n(M77)\r\n\r\nMatters assumed an entirely different aspect when Stephen was made\r\nprisoner at Lincoln in the following year (2nd Feb., 1141). Henry of\r\nWinchester forsook his role of arbitrator, and entered into a formal\r\ncompact with the empress who arrived before Winchester with the laurels of\r\nher recent success yet fresh, agreeing to receive her as \"Lady of\r\nEngland,\" (_Domina Angliae_) and promising her the allegiance of himself\r\nand his followers so long as she would keep her oath and allow him a free\r\nhand in ecclesiastical matters.(114)\r\n\r\n(M78)\r\n\r\nThis compact was entered into on the 2nd March, and on the following day\r\nthe empress was received with solemn pomp into Winchester Cathedral. It\r\nremained for the compact to be ratified. For this purpose an\r\necclesiastical synod was summoned to sit at Winchester on the 7th April.\r\nThe day was spent by the legate holding informal communications with the\r\nbishops, abbots, and archdeacons who were in attendance, and who then for\r\nthe first time in England's history claimed the right not only of\r\nconsecration, but of election of the sovereign.(115)\r\n\r\nOn the 8th April, Henry in a long speech announced to the assembled clergy\r\nthe result of the conclave of the previous day. He extolled the good\r\ngovernment of the late king who before his death had caused fealty to be\r\nsworn to his daughter, the empress. The delay of the empress in coming to\r\nEngland (he said) had been the cause of Stephen's election. The latter had\r\nforfeited all claim to the crown by his bad government, and God's judgment\r\nhad been pronounced against him. Lest therefore, the nation should suffer\r\nfor want of a sovereign, he, as legate, had summoned them together, and by\r\nthem the empress had been elected Lady of England. The speech was received\r\nwith unanimous applause, those to whom the election did not commend itself\r\nbeing wise enough to hold their tongue.\r\n\r\n(M79)\r\n\r\nBut there was another element to be considered before Matilda's new title\r\ncould be assured. What would the Londoners who had taken the initiative in\r\nsetting Stephen on the throne, and still owed to them their allegiance,\r\nsay to it? The legate had foreseen the difficulty that might arise if the\r\ncitizens, whom he described as very princes of the realm, by reason of the\r\ngreatness of their city (_qui sunt quasi optimates pro magnitudine\r\ncivitatis in Anglia_), could not be won over. He had, therefore, sent a\r\nspecial safe conduct for their attendance, so he informed the meeting\r\nafter the applause which followed his speech had died away, and he\r\nexpected them to arrive on the following day. If they pleased they would\r\nadjourn till then.\r\n\r\n(M80)\r\n\r\nThe next day (9th April) the Londoners arrived, as the legate had\r\nforetold, and were ushered before the council. They had been sent, they\r\nsaid, by the so called \"commune\" of London; and their purpose was not to\r\nenter into debate, but only to beg for the release of their lord, the\r\nking.(116) The statement was supported by all the barons then present who\r\nhad entered the commune of the city(117) and met with the approval of the\r\narchbishop and all the clergy in attendance. Their solicitations, however,\r\nproved of no avail. The legate replied with the same arguments he had used\r\nthe day before, adding that it ill became the Londoners who were regarded\r\nas nobles (_quasi proceres_) in the land to foster those who had basely\r\ndeserted their king on the field of battle, and who only curried favour\r\nwith the citizens in order to fleece them of their money.\r\n\r\n(M81)\r\n\r\nHere an interruption took place. A messenger presented to the legate a\r\npaper from Stephen's queen to read to the council. Henry took the paper,\r\nand after scanning its contents, refused to communicate them to the\r\nmeeting. The messenger, however, not to be thus foiled, himself made known\r\nthe contents of the paper. These were, in effect, an exhortation by the\r\nqueen to the clergy, and more especially to the legate himself, to restore\r\nStephen to liberty. The legate, however, returned the same answer as\r\nbefore, and the meeting broke up, the Londoners promising to communicate\r\nthe decision of the council to their brethren at home, and to do their\r\nbest to obtain their support.\r\n\r\n(M82)\r\n\r\nThe next two months were occupied by the empress and her supporters in\r\npreparing the way for her admission into the city, the inhabitants of\r\nwhich, had as yet shown but little disposition towards her. But however\r\ngreat their inclination may have been to Stephen, they at length found\r\nthemselves forced to transfer their allegiance and to offer, for a time at\r\nleast, a politic submission to the empress. Accordingly, a deputation went\r\nout to meet her at St. Albans (May 1141), and arrange terms on which the\r\ncity should surrender.(118)\r\n\r\nMore delay took place; and it was not until shortly before midsummer\r\n(1141), that she entered the city. Her stay was brief. She treated the\r\ninhabitants as vanquished foes,(119) extorted large sums of money,(120)\r\nand haughtily refused to observe the laws of Edward the Confessor they\r\nvalued so much, preferring those of the late king, her father.(121)\r\n\r\n(M83)\r\n\r\nThe consequence was that, within a few days of her arrival in London, the\r\ninhabitants rose in revolt, drove her out of the city(122) and attacked\r\nthe Tower, of which Geoffrey de Mandeville was constable, as his father\r\nWilliam had been before him.(123)\r\n\r\n(M84)\r\n\r\nThis Geoffrey de Mandeville had been recently created Earl of Essex by\r\nStephen, in the hope and expectation that the fortress over which Geoffrey\r\nwas governor, would be held secure for the royal cause. The newly fledged\r\nearl, however, was one who ever fought for his own hand, and was ready to\r\nsell his fortress and sword to the highest bidder. The few days that the\r\nempress was in the city, afforded her an opportunity of risking a trial to\r\nwin over the earl from his allegiance. To this end she offered to confirm\r\nhim in his earldom and to continue him in his office of Constable of the\r\nTower, conferred upon him by Stephen; in addition to which, she was ready\r\nto allow him to enjoy lands of the rent of L100 a year, a license to\r\nfortify his castles, and the posts of sheriff and justiciar throughout his\r\nearldom. The bait was too tempting for the earl not to accept; and a\r\ncharter to the above effect was drawn up and executed.(124)\r\n\r\n(M85)\r\n\r\nScarcely had the fickle earl consented to throw in his lot with the\r\nempress before she had to flee the city. The departure of the empress was\r\nquickly followed by the arrival of her namesake, Matilda, the valiant\r\nqueen of the captured Stephen; and again the earl proved false to his\r\nallegiance and actively supported the queen in concert with the\r\ncitizens.(125)\r\n\r\n(M86)\r\n\r\nWith his aid(126) and the aid of the Londoners,(127) the queen was enabled\r\nto reduce Winchester and to effect the liberation of her husband by\r\nexchanging the Earl of Gloucester, brother of the empress, for the\r\ncaptured king.\r\n\r\n(M87)\r\n\r\nAfter being solemnly crowned, for the second time,(128) at Canterbury,\r\nStephen issued a second charter (about Christmas time, 1141),(129) to\r\nGeoffrey de Mandeville, confirming and augmenting the previous grant by\r\nthe empress. Instead of sheriff and justiciar of his own county of Essex\r\nmerely, he is now made sheriff and justiciar of London and Middlesex, as\r\nwell as of Hertfordshire.\r\n\r\n(M88)\r\n\r\nBut even these great concessions failed to secure the earl's fidelity to\r\nthe king. Again he broke away from his allegiance and planned a revolt in\r\nfavour of the empress who recompensed him with still greater dignities and\r\npossessions than any yet bestowed. This second charter of the\r\nempress,(130) is remarkable for a clause in which she promises never to\r\nmake terms with the Londoners without the earl's consent, \"because they\r\nare his mortal foes.\"(131) But the plans of the earl were doomed to be\r\nfrustrated. The empress, tired of the struggle, soon ceased to be\r\ndangerous, and eventually withdrew to the continent, and Stephen was left\r\nfree to deal with the rebel earl alone. With the assistance of the\r\nLondoners, who throughout the long period of civil dissension, were\r\ngenerally to be found on the winning side, and held as it were the balance\r\nbetween the rival powers, Stephen managed after considerable bloodshed to\r\ncapture the fortifications erected by the Earl at Farringdon.(132)\r\n\r\n(M89)\r\n\r\nThe earl was subsequently treacherously arrested and made to give up his\r\ncastles. Thenceforth his life was that of a marauding freebooter, until,\r\nfatally wounded at the siege of Burwell, he expired in September, 1143.\r\n\r\n(M90)\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the absence of the empress and the death of the faithless\r\nearl, a desultory kind of war continued to be carried on for the next ten\r\nyears on behalf of Henry of Anjou, son of the empress. In 1153 that prince\r\narrived in England to fight his own battles and maintain his right to the\r\ncrown, which the king had already attempted to transfer to the head of his\r\nown son Eustace. This attempt had been foiled by the refusal of the\r\nbishops, at the instigation of the pope, to perform the ceremony. The\r\nsudden death of Eustace made the king more ready to enter into\r\nnegotiations for effecting a peaceful settlement.\r\n\r\n(M91) (M92)\r\n\r\nA compromise was accordingly effected at Winchester,(133) whereby Stephen\r\nwas to remain in undisputed possession of the throne for life, and after\r\nhis death was to be succeeded by Henry. The news that at last an end had\r\ncome to the troubles which for nineteen years had disturbed the country,\r\nwas received with universal joy, and Henry, conducted to London by the\r\nking himself, was welcomed in a manner befitting one who was now the\r\nrecognised heir to the crown.(134)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(M93)\r\n\r\nBoth London and Winchester had been laid in ashes during Stephen's reign,\r\nthe former by a conflagration--which took place in 1136, again destroying\r\nSt. Paul's and extending from London Bridge to the church of St. Clement\r\nDanes--the latter by the burning missiles used in the conflict between\r\nStephen and the empress in 1141. Winchester never recovered her position,\r\nand London was left without a rival. Fitz-Stephen, who wrote an account of\r\nthe city as it stood in the reign of Henry II, describes it as holding its\r\nhead higher than all others; its fame was wider known; its wealth and\r\nmerchandise extended further than any other; it was the capital of the\r\nkingdom (_regni Anglorum sedes_).(135)\r\n\r\n(M94)\r\n\r\nIt was through the mediation of an intimate friend and fellow citizen of\r\nFitz-Stephen that Archbishop Theobald had invited Henry of Anjou over from\r\nFrance in 1153. Thomas of London, better known as Thomas Becket, although\r\nof foreign descent, was born in the heart of the city, having first seen\r\nthe light in the house of Gilbert, his father, some time Portreeve of\r\nLondon, situate in Cheapside on a site now occupied by the hall and chapel\r\nof the Mercers' Chapel. Having been ordained a deacon of the Church, he\r\nbecame in course of time clerk or chaplain to the archbishop. Vigorous and\r\nactive as he was, Thomas soon made his influence felt, and it was owing to\r\nhis suggestion (so it is said(136)) that the bishops had declined to be a\r\nparty to the coronation of Eustace during Stephen's lifetime.\r\n\r\nOn the accession of Henry, Thomas passed from the service of the\r\narchbishop, then advanced in years, to the service of the young king. He\r\nwas raised to the dignity of chancellor, and became one of the king's most\r\ntrusted advisers. By their united efforts order was once again restored\r\nthroughout the kingdom. The great barons, who had established themselves\r\nin castles erected without royal licence, were brought into subjection to\r\nthe crown and compelled to pull down their walls. Upon the death of the\r\narchbishop, Thomas was appointed to the vacant See (1162). From that day\r\nforward the friendship between king and archbishop began to wane. Henry\r\nfound that all his attempts to establish order in his kingdom were\r\nthwarted by exemptions claimed by the archbishop on behalf of the clergy.\r\nHe found that allegiance to the Crown was divided with allegiance to the\r\nPope, and this state of things was likely to continue so long as the\r\narchbishop lived. Becket's end is familiar to us all. His memory was long\r\ncherished by the citizens of London, who made many a pilgrimage to the\r\nscene of his martyrdom and left many an offering on his tomb in the\r\ncathedral of Canterbury. It is hard to say for which of the two, the\r\nfather or the son, the citizens entertained the greater reverence. For\r\nmany years after his death it was the custom for the Mayor of the City for\r\nthe time being, upon entering into office, to meet the aldermen at the\r\nchurch of St. Thomas of Acon--a church which had been erected and endowed\r\nin honour of the murdered archbishop by his sister Agnes, wife of Thomas\r\nFitz-Theobald of Helles(137)--and thence to proceed to the tomb of Gilbert\r\nBecket, the father, in St. Paul's churchyard, there to say a _De\r\nprofundis_; after which both mayor and aldermen returned to the church of\r\nSt. Thomas, and, each having made an offering of two pence, returned to\r\nhis own home.(138) St. Thomas's Hospital, in Southwark, was originally\r\ndedicated to the murdered archbishop, but after its dissolution and\r\nsubsequent restoration as one of the Royal Hospitals, its patron saint was\r\nno longer Thomas the Martyr, but Thomas the Apostle.\r\n\r\n(M95)\r\n\r\nWhilst the king and his chancellor were busy settling the kingdom,\r\nestablishing a uniform administration of justice and system of revenue,\r\nand not only renewing but extending the form of government which had been\r\ninstituted by Henry I, the citizens of London, availing themselves of the\r\nsecurity afforded by a strong government, redoubled their energy in\r\nfollowing commercial pursuits and succeeded in raising the city, as\r\nFitz-Stephen has told us, to a pitch of prosperity far exceeding that of\r\nany other city in the world.\r\n\r\nThey obtained a charter from Henry,(139) although of a more limited\r\ncharacter than that granted to them by his grandfather. The later charter,\r\nfor instance, although in the main lines following the older charter,\r\nmakes no mention of Middlesex being let to ferm nor of any appointment of\r\nsheriff or justiciar being vested in the citizens. It appears as if Henry\r\nwas determined to bring the citizens no less than the barons of the realm\r\nwithin more direct and immediate subservience to the crown. The concession\r\nmade by the king's grandfather had been ignored by Stephen and the empress\r\nMatilda, each of whom in turn had granted the shrievalty of London and\r\nMiddlesex to the Earl of Essex. For a time the appointment of sheriffs was\r\nlost to the citizens. Throughout the reigns of Henry II and his successor\r\nthey were appointed by the crown. Richard's charter to the citizens makes\r\nno mention of the sheriffwick, nor is it mentioned in the first charter\r\ngranted by John. When it was restored to the citizens (A.D. 1199), by\r\nJohn's second charter, the office of sheriff of London had lost much of\r\nits importance owing to the introduction of the communal system of\r\nmunicipal government under a mayor.\r\n\r\n(M96)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the sheriffs of the counties, who had by reason of Henry's\r\nadministrative reforms, risen to be officers of greater importance and\r\nwider jurisdiction, and who had taken advantage of their positions to\r\noppress the people during the king's prolonged absence abroad, were also\r\nmade to feel the power of the crown. A blow struck at the sheriffs was\r\ncalculated to weaken the nobility and the larger landowners--the class from\r\nwhich it had been the custom hitherto to select these officers. Henry saw\r\nthe advantage to be gained, and on his return to England in 1170 deposed\r\nmost of the sheriffs and ordered a strict enquiry to be made, as to the\r\nextortions they had committed in his absence. Their places were filled for\r\nthe most part by men of lower rank, and therefore likely to be more\r\nsubmissive. Some, however, were reinstated and became more cruel and\r\nextortionate than ever.(140)\r\n\r\n(M97)\r\n\r\nThe last fifteen years of Henry's life were full of domestic trouble. He\r\nhad always found it an easier matter to rule his kingdom than his\r\nhousehold. His sons were for ever thwarting his will and quarrelling with\r\neach other. It was his desire to secure the succession to the crown for\r\nhis eldest son Henry, and to this end he had caused him to be crowned by\r\nthe Archbishop of York (14th June, 1170), who was thereupon declared\r\nexcommunicated by his brother of Canterbury. The son began to clamour for\r\nhis inheritance whilst his father still lived, and appealed in 1173 to the\r\nFrench king, whose daughter he had married, to assist him in his unholy\r\nenterprise. Whilst Henry was engaged in defending his crown against his\r\nown son on the continent, the great barons of England rose in\r\ninsurrection, and the king was obliged to hasten home, where he arrived in\r\nJuly, 1174. The rebellion was quickly put down, and the strife between\r\nking and nobles for a time ceased.\r\n\r\n(M98)\r\n\r\nIn the city there were occasional disturbances caused by the younger\r\nnobility--the young bloods of the city(141)--who infested the streets at\r\nnight, broke into the houses of the rich and committed every kind of\r\nexcess. In 1177 the brother of the Earl of Ferrers was waylaid and killed,\r\nand for some time the streets were unsafe at night. The chronicler records\r\na singular outrage perpetrated three years before, by these sprigs of\r\nnobility. They forcibly entered the house of a wealthy citizen whose name\r\nhas not come down to us, he is simply styled the _pater-familias_. Of his\r\ncourage we are left in no doubt, for we are told that he slipt on a coat\r\nof mail, armed his house-hold, and awaited the attack. He had not long to\r\nwait. The leader of the band--one Andrew Bucquinte soon made his\r\nappearance, and was met by a pan of hot coals. Swords were drawn on both\r\nsides and _pater-familias_, whose coat of mail served him well, succeeded\r\nin cutting off the right hand of his assailant. Upon the cry of thieves\r\nbeing raised, the delinquents took to their heels, leaving their leader a\r\nprisoner.  The next day, being brought before the king's justiciar, he\r\ninformed against his companions. This cowardly action on the part of\r\nBucquinte led to many of them being taken, and among them one who is\r\ndescribed by the chronicler as the noblest and wealthiest of London\r\ncitizens, but to whom the chronicler gives no other name than \"John, the\r\nold man\" (_Johannes Senex_). An offer was made to John to prove his\r\ninnocence by what was known as the ordeal by water,(142) but the offer was\r\ndeclined, and he was eventually hanged. The whole story looks suspicious.\r\n\r\n(M99)\r\n\r\nHaving settled the succession of the crown of England upon his eldest son,\r\nthe king put his second son, Richard, into possession of the Duchy of\r\nAquitaine, and provided for his third son, Geoffrey, by marriage with the\r\nheiress of Brittany. There was yet another son, John, who was too young to\r\nbe provided for just now, and who being without any territory, assigned to\r\nhim, acquired the name of Lackland. Both Richard and Geoffrey had taken\r\nthe part of their brother Henry in 1173, and in 1177 the three brothers\r\nwere again quarrelling with their father and with each other. After the\r\ndeaths of Henry and Geoffrey, the quarrel was taken up by the surviving\r\nbrothers, Richard and John.\r\n\r\nIn all these--more or less--petty wars with his sons, the king had always to\r\ndeal with the ruler of France. At last, in 1189, the loss of Le Mans--his\r\nown birth-place--and the unexpected discovery that his youngest and best\r\nbeloved son, John, had turned traitor towards him, left the king nothing\r\nto live for, and after a few days suffering he died, ill and worn out, at\r\nChinon.\r\n\r\n(M100)\r\n\r\nRichard had scarcely succeeded to the throne, before he set out on a\r\ncrusade, leaving the government of his country in the hands of William\r\nLongchamp, Bishop of Ely, as chancellor.(143) With him was associated in\r\nthe government, Hugh de Puiset, or Pudsey, Bishop of Durham, but Longchamp\r\nsoon got the supreme control of affairs into his own hands, and commenced\r\nto act in the most tyrannical fashion. He increased the security of the\r\nTower of London, which had been committed to his charge, by surrounding it\r\nwith a moat,(144) and having got himself nominated papal legate, made a\r\nprogress through the country committing the greatest extortion.(145)\r\n\r\n(M101) (M102)\r\n\r\nReport of the Chancellor's conduct having reached the ears of Richard, he\r\ndespatched the Archbishop of Rouen to England with a new commission, but\r\nthe worthy prelate on arrival (April, 1191), was afraid to present the\r\ncommission, preferring to let matters take their course.(146) Already a\r\nfierce rivalry had sprung up between the chancellor and John, the king's\r\nbrother, who, for purposes of his own, had espoused the cause of the\r\noppressed. Popular feeling at length became so strong, that Longchamp\r\nfeared to meet John and the bishops, and, instead of going to Reading,\r\nwhere his attendance was required, he hastened to London. Arriving there\r\n(7 Oct.), he called the citizens together in the Guildhall, and prayed\r\nthem to uphold the King against John, whom he denounced as aiming plainly\r\nat the Crown. The leading men in the city at the time were Richard\r\nFitz-Reiner and Henry de Cornhill. These took opposite sides, the former\r\nfavouring John, whilst the latter took the side of the chancellor.(147)\r\nJohn's party proving the stronger of the two, Longchamp thought it safest\r\nto seek refuge in the Tower.(148)\r\n\r\n(M103)\r\n\r\nAs soon as John found that the chancellor had gone to London instead of\r\nReading, he too hastened thither. On his arrival he was welcomed and\r\nhospitably entertained by Richard Fitz-Reiner who gave him to understand\r\non what terms he might expect the support of the city.(149) As to terms,\r\nJohn was ready to accede to any that might be proposed.\r\n\r\n(M104) (M105)\r\n\r\nThe next day (8 Oct.), a meeting of the barons of the realm, as well as of\r\nthe citizens of London, was convened in St. Paul's Church, to consider the\r\nconduct of the chancellor, and it was thereupon decided that Longchamp\r\nshould be deposed from office. The story, as told by different\r\nchroniclers,(150) varies in some particulars, but the main features are\r\nthe same in all. The king's minister was set aside, John was recognised as\r\nthe head of the kingdom, and new appointments made to judicial, fiscal,\r\nand military offices. The Archbishop of Rouen, who attended the council,\r\nseeing the turn affairs had taken, no longer hesitated to produce the\r\nletters under the king's sign manual appointing a new commission for the\r\ngovernment of the kingdom.\r\n\r\n(M106)\r\n\r\nThe same day that witnessed the fall of Longchamp was also a memorable one\r\nin the annals of the City of London; for immediately after judgment had\r\nbeen passed on the chancellor, John and the assembled barons granted to\r\nthe citizens \"their commune,\" swearing to preserve untouched the dignities\r\nof the city during the king's pleasure.  The citizens on their part swore\r\nfealty to King Richard, and declared their readiness to accept John as\r\nsuccessor to the throne in the event of his brother dying childless.(151)\r\n\r\n(M107)\r\n\r\nThis is the first public recognition of the citizens of London as a body\r\ncorporate; but so far from granting to them something new, the very words\r\n_their_ commune (_communam suam_) imply a commune of which they were _de\r\nfacto_, if not _de jure_ already in enjoyment. How long the commune may\r\nhave been in existence, unauthorised by the crown, cannot be determined;\r\nbut that the term _communio_ in connection with the city's organization\r\nwas known half a century before, we have already seen;(152) and, according\r\nto the opinion of Giraldus Cambrensis, there is no valid distinction\r\nbetween the words _communio_, _communa_ and _communia_.(153) Bishop\r\nStubbs, however, hesitates to translate _communio_ as \"commune,\" the\r\nlatter being essentially a French term for a particular form of municipal\r\ngovernment. He prefers to render it \"commonalty,\" \"fraternity,\" or\r\n\"franchise,\" although he goes so far as to allow that the term \"suggests\r\nthat the communal idea was already in existence as a basis of civic\r\norganization\" in Stephen's reign, an idea which became fully developed in\r\nthe succeeding reign.(154) He is also in favour of dating the foundation\r\nof the _communa_ in London from this grant by John and the barons,(155)\r\nand in this view he is supported by Richard of Devizes, who distinctly\r\nstates that the _communia_ of London was instituted on that occasion, and\r\nthat it was of such a character that neither King Richard nor Henry his\r\nfather would have conceded it for a million marks of silver, and that a\r\n_communia_ was in fact everything that was bad. It puffed up the people,\r\nit threatened the kingdom, and it emasculated the priesthood.(156)\r\n\r\n(M108)\r\n\r\nWith the change from a shire organization to that of a French _commune_,\r\nwhenever that happened to take place, there took place also a change in\r\nthe chief governor of the city. The head of the city was no longer a Saxon\r\n\"port-reeve\" but a French \"mayor,\" the former officer continuing in all\r\nprobability to perform the duties of a port-reeve or sheriff of a town in\r\na modified form. From the time when this \"civic revolution\"(157) occurred,\r\ndown to the present day, the sheriff's position has always been one of\r\nsecondary importance, being himself subordinate to the mayor.\r\n\r\n(M109)\r\n\r\nThe earliest mention of a mayor of London in a formal document is said to\r\noccur in a writ of the reign of Henry II.(158) The popular opinion,\r\nhowever, is that a change in the name of the chief magistrate of the City\r\nof London took place at the accession of Richard I. What gave rise to this\r\nbelief is hard to say, but it is not improbable that it arose from a\r\nstatement to be found in an early manuscript record still preserved among\r\nthe archives of the Corporation, and known as the _Liber de Antiquis\r\nLegibus_.(159) The original portion of this manuscript purports to be a\r\nchronicle of mayors and sheriffs from 1188 down to 1273, noticing briefly\r\nthe chief events in each year, and referring to a few particulars relative\r\nto the year 1274.\r\n\r\nAfter naming the sheriffs who were appointed at Michaelmas, A.D. 1188,\r\n\"the first year of the reign of King Richard,\"(160) it goes on to say that\r\n\"in the same year Henry Fitz-Eylwin of Londenestane was made mayor of\r\nLondon, who was the first mayor of the city, and continued to be such\r\nmayor to the end of his life, that is to say, for nearly five and twenty\r\nyears.\" That Henry Fitz-Eylwin was mayor in the first year of Richard's\r\nreign is stated no less than three times in the chronicle.(161)\r\n\r\n(M110)\r\n\r\nThe compiler of the chronicle is supposed to have been Arnald or Arnulf\r\nFitz-Thedmar,(162) an Alderman of London, although it is not known over\r\nwhich ward he presided. Particulars of his life are given in the volume\r\nitself, from which we gather that he was a grandson on the mother's side\r\nof Arnald de Grevingge(163) a citizen of Cologne; that his father's name\r\nwas Thedmar, a native of Bremen; that he was born on the vigil of St.\r\nLawrence [10 August] A.D. 1201, his mother being forewarned of the\r\ncircumstances that would attend his birth in a manner familiar to biblical\r\nreaders; that he was deprived of his aldermanry by the king, but was\r\nafterwards restored; that he became supporter of the king against Simon de\r\nMontfort and the barons, and that he was among those whom Thomas\r\nFitz-Thomas, the leader of the democratic party and his followers, had\r\n\"intended to slay\" on the very day that news reached London of the battle\r\nof Evesham, which crushed the hopes of Montfort and his supporters. The\r\ndate of his death cannot be precisely determined, but there can be but\r\nlittle doubt that it took place early in the third year of the reign of\r\nEdward the First, inasmuch as his will was proved and enrolled in the\r\nCourt of Husting, London, held on Monday, the morrow of the Feast of St.\r\nScolastica [10 Feb.] of that year (A.D. 1274-5).(164)\r\n\r\nSetting aside the statement--namely that mention is made of a mayor of\r\nLondon, in a document of the reign of Henry II--as wanting corroboration,\r\nthe first instance known at the present day of any such official being\r\nnamed in a formal document occurs in 1193 when the Mayor of London appears\r\namong those who were appointed treasurers of Richard's ransom.(165)\r\n\r\n(M111)\r\n\r\nRichard's first charter to the City (23 April, 1194)(166) granted a few\r\nweeks after his return from abroad makes no mention of a mayor, nor does\r\nthe title occur in any royal charter affecting the City until the year\r\n1202, when John attempted to suppress the guild of weavers \"at the request\r\nof our mayor and citizens of London.\" A few years later when John was\r\nready to do anything and everything to avoid signing the Great Charter\r\nwhich the barons were forcing on him, he made a bid for the favour of the\r\ncitizens by granting them the right to elect annually a mayor, and thus\r\ntheir autonomy was rendered complete.\r\n\r\n(M112)\r\n\r\nWhen Richard recovered his liberty and returned to England he was heartily\r\nwelcomed by all except his brother John. One of his first acts was to\r\nvisit the City and return thanks for his safety at St. Paul's.(167) The\r\nCity was on this occasion made to look its brightest, and the display of\r\nwealth astonished the foreigners in the King's suite, who had been led to\r\nbelieve that England had been brought to the lowest stage of poverty by\r\npayment of the King's ransom.(168)\r\n\r\n(M113) (M114)\r\n\r\nIn order to wipe out the stain of his imprisonment, he thought fit to go\r\nthrough the ceremony of coronation for the second time. His first\r\ncoronation had taken place at Westminster (3 Sept., 1189,) soon after his\r\naccession, and the citizens of London had duly performed a service at the\r\ncoronation banquet--a service which even in those days was recognised as an\r\n\"ancient service\"--namely, that of assisting the chief butler, for which\r\nthe mayor was customarily presented with a gold cup and ewer. The citizens\r\nof the rival city of Winchester performed on this occasion the lesser\r\nservice of attending to the viands.(169)\r\n\r\nThe second coronation taking place at Winchester and not at Westminster,\r\nthe burgesses of the former city put in a claim to the more honourable\r\nservice over the heads of the citizens of London, and the latter only\r\nsucceeded in establishing their superior claim by a judicious bribe of 200\r\nmarks.(170)\r\n\r\n(M115)\r\n\r\nRichard was ever in want of money, and cared little by what means it was\r\nraised. He declared himself ready to sell London itself if a purchaser\r\ncould be found.(171) The tax of Danegelt, from which the citizens of\r\nLondon had been specially exempted by charter of Henry I, and which had\r\nceased to be exacted under Henry II, mainly through the interposition of\r\nThomas of London, was practically revived under a new name. The charter\r\nalready mentioned as having been granted to the citizens by Richard after\r\nhis return from captivity was probably purchased, for one of the king's\r\nregular methods of raising money was a lavish distribution of charters to\r\nboroughs, not from any love he had for municipal government, but in order\r\nto put money in his purse. As soon as Richard had collected all the money\r\nhe could raise in England, he again left the country, never to return.\r\n\r\n(M116)\r\n\r\nThe pressure of taxation weighed heavily on the poor, and occasioned a\r\nrising in the city under the leadership of William Fitz-Osbert. The cry\r\nwas that the rich were spared whilst the poor were called upon to pay\r\neverything.(172) Accounts of the commotion differ according as the writer\r\nfavoured the autocratic or democratic side. One chronicler, for instance,\r\nfinds fault with Fitz-Osbert's personal appearance, imputing his\r\ninordinate length of beard--he was known as \"Longbeard\"--to his desire for\r\nconspicuousness, and declares him to have been actuated by base\r\nmotives.(173)\r\n\r\nOthers describe him as a wealthy citizen of the best family, and yet as\r\none who ever upheld the cause of the poor against the king's\r\nextortions.(174) Whatever may have been the true character of the man and\r\nthe real motive of his action, it is certain that he had a large\r\nfollowing. When Hubert Walter, the justiciar, sent to arrest him,\r\n\"Longbeard\" took refuge in the church of St. Mary-le-Bow. Thither he was\r\nfollowed by the king's officers--described by a not impartial chronicler as\r\nmen devoid of truth and piety and enemies of the poor.(175)--who with the\r\naid of fire and faggot soon compelled him to surrender. On his way to the\r\nTower, he was struck at and wounded by one whose father (it was said) he\r\nhad formerly killed;(176) but this again may or may not be the whole\r\ntruth. A few days later he and a number of his associates were\r\nhanged.(177)\r\n\r\n(M117)\r\n\r\nTwo years before his death at Chaluz, Richard, with the view of aiding\r\ncommerce, caused the wears in the Thames to be removed, and forbade his\r\nwardens of the Tower to demand any more the toll that had been accustomed.\r\nThe writ to this effect was dated from the Island of Andely or Les Andelys\r\non the Seine, the 14th July, 1197, in the neighbourhood of that fortress\r\nwhich Richard had erected, and of which he was so proud--the Chateau\r\nGaillard or \"Saucy Castle,\" as he jestingly called it. The reputation\r\nwhich the castle enjoyed for impregnability under Richard, was lost under\r\nhis successor on the throne.\r\n\r\n(M118)\r\n\r\nSoon after John's accession we find what appears to be the first mention\r\nof a court of aldermen as a deliberative body. In the year 1200, writes\r\nThedmar (himself an alderman), \"were chosen five and twenty of the more\r\ndiscreet men of the city, and sworn to take counsel on behalf of the city,\r\ntogether with the mayor.\"(178) Just as in the constitution of the realm,\r\nthe House of Lords can claim a greater antiquity than the House of\r\nCommons, so in the city--described by Lord Coke as _epitome totius\r\nregni_--the establishment of a court of aldermen preceded that of the\r\ncommon council.\r\n\r\n(M119)\r\n\r\nWhen, after thirteen years of misgovernment, during which John had enraged\r\nthe barons and excited general discontent by endless impositions, matters\r\nwere brought to a climax by his submission to the pope, it was in the city\r\nof London that the first steps were taken by his subjects to recover their\r\nlost liberty. On the 25th August, 1213, a meeting of the clergy and barons\r\nwas held in the church of St. Paul; a memorable meeting, and one that has\r\nbeen described as \"a true parliament of the realm, though no king presided\r\nin it.\"(179) Stephen Langton, whose appointment as Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury had so raised John's ire, took the lead and produced to the\r\nassembly a copy of the Charter of Liberties, granted by Henry I, when that\r\nking undertook to put an end to the tyranny of William Rufus. If the\r\nbarons so pleased, it might (he said) serve as a precedent. The charter\r\nhaving been then and there deliberately read, the barons unanimously\r\ndeclared that for such liberties they were ready to fight, and, if\r\nnecessary, to die.(180)\r\n\r\nThe clergy and people who had hitherto supported the king against the\r\nbarons, having now engaged themselves to assist the barons against the\r\ntyranny of the king, John found himself with but one friend in the world,\r\nand that was the Pope. \"Innocent's view of the situation was very simple,\"\r\nwrites Dr. Gardiner, \"John was to obey the Pope, and all John's subjects\r\nwere to obey John.\" Within a few weeks of the council being held at St.\r\nPaul's, the same sacred edifice witnessed the formality of affixing a\r\ngolden _bulla_ to the deed--the detestable deed (_carta\r\ndetestabilis_)--whereby John had in May last resigned the crown of England\r\nto the papal legate, and received it again as the Pope's feudatory.(181)\r\n\r\n(M120)\r\n\r\nIn the following year (1214), whilst the king was abroad, the barons met\r\nagain at Bury St. Edmunds, and solemnly swore that if John any longer\r\ndelayed restoring the laws and liberties of Henry the First, they would\r\nmake war upon him. It was arranged that after Christmas they should go in\r\na body and demand their rights, and that in the meantime they should\r\nprovide themselves with horses and arms, with the view of bringing force\r\nto bear, in case of refusal.(182) The citizens at the same time took the\r\nopportunity of strengthening their defences by digging a foss on the\r\nfurther side of the city wall.(183)\r\n\r\n(M121)\r\n\r\nChristmas came and a meeting between John and the barons took place in\r\nLondon at what was then known as the \"New\" Temple. The result, however,\r\nwas unsatisfactory, and both parties prepared for an appeal to force, the\r\nbarons choosing as their leader Robert Fitz-Walter, whom they dubbed\r\n\"Marshal of the army of God and of Holy Church.\"(184)\r\n\r\n(M122)\r\n\r\nThis Fitz-Walter was Baron of Dunmow in Essex, the owner of Baynard's\r\nCastle in the City of London, and lord of a soke, which embraced the whole\r\nof the parish known as St. Andrew Castle Baynard. He moreover enjoyed the\r\ndignity of castellain and chief bannerer or banneret of London. The rights\r\nand privileges attaching to his soke and to his official position in time\r\nof peace were considerable, to judge from a claim to them put forward by\r\nhis grandson in the year 1303. Upon making his appearance in the Court of\r\nHusting at the Guildhall, it was the duty of the Mayor, or other official\r\nholding the court, to rise and meet him and place him by his side. Again,\r\nif any traitor were taken within his soke or jurisdiction, it was his\r\nright to sentence him to death, the manner of death being that the\r\nconvicted person should be tied to a post in the Thames at the Wood Wharf,\r\nand remain there during two tides and two ebbs.(185)\r\n\r\nIn later years, however, upon an enquiry being held by the Justiciars of\r\nthe Iter (a deg. 14 Edward II, A.D. 1321), the claimant was obliged to\r\nacknowledge that he had disposed of Baynard's Castle in the time of Edward\r\nI, but had especially reserved to himself all rights attaching to the\r\ncastle and barony, although he very considerately declared his willingness\r\nto forego the right and title enjoyed by his ancestor of drowning traitors\r\nat Wood Wharf.(186)\r\n\r\n(M123)\r\n\r\nBut it was in time of war that Fitz-Walter achieved for himself the\r\ngreatest power and dignity. It then became the duty of the castellain to\r\nproceed to the great gate of St. Paul's attended by nineteen other\r\nknights, mounted and caparisoned, and having his banner, emblazoned with\r\nhis arms, displayed before him. Immediately upon his arrival, the mayor,\r\naldermen, and sheriffs, who awaited him, issued solemnly forth from the\r\nchurch, all arrayed in arms, the mayor bearing in his hand the city\r\nbanner, the ground of which was bright vermilion or gules, with a figure\r\nof St. Paul, in gold, thereon, the head, feet, and hands of the saint\r\nbeing silver or argent, and in his right hand a sword.(187) The\r\ncastellain, advancing to meet the mayor, informed him that he had come to\r\ndo the service which the city had a right to demand at his hands, and\r\nthereupon the mayor placed the city's banner in his hands, and then,\r\nattending him back to the gate, presented him with a charger of the value\r\nof L20, its saddle emblazoned with the arms of Fitz-Walter, and its\r\nhousing of cendal or silk, similarly enriched.\r\n\r\nA sum of L20 was at the same time handed to Fitz-Walter's chamberlain to\r\ndefray the day's expenses. Having mounted his charger, he bids the Mayor\r\nto choose a Marshal of the host of the City of London; and this being\r\ndone, the communal or \"mote-bell\" is set ringing, and the whole party\r\nproceed to the Priory of Holy Trinity at Aldgate. There they dismount, and\r\nentering the Priory, concert measures together for the defence of the\r\ncity. There is one other point worthy of remark, touching the office of\r\nchief banneret, and that is that on the occasion of any siege undertaken\r\nby the London forces, the castellain was to receive as his fee the\r\nniggardly sum of one hundred shillings for his trouble, and no more.\r\n\r\n(M124)\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that Fitz-Walter's election as leader of the\r\nremonstrant barons was in some measure due to his official position in the\r\ncity. It is also probable, as Mr. Riley has pointed out, that the\r\nunopposed admission of the barons into the city, on the 24th May, 1215,\r\nmay have been facilitated by Fitz-Walter's connexion, as castellain, with\r\nthe Priory of Holy Trinity, situate in the vicinity.\r\n\r\nBut there were other reasons for selecting Fitz-Walter as their leader at\r\nthis juncture. If the story be true, Fitz-Walter had good reason to be\r\nbitterly hostile to King John, for having caused his fair daughter Maude\r\nor Matilda to be poisoned, after having unsuccessfully made an attempt\r\nupon her chastity.(188) This is not the only crime of the kind laid to the\r\ncharge of this monarch,(189) and there appears to be too much reason for\r\nbelieving most of the charges against him to be true. It is certain that\r\nFitz-Walter was one of the first to entertain designs against John, and\r\nthat he and Eustace de Vesci, on whose family the king is said to have put\r\na similar affront, were forced to escape to France. The story how\r\nFitz-Walter attracted John's notice by his prowess at a tournament in\r\nwhich he was engaged on the side of the French, and was restored to the\r\nKing's favour and his own estates, is familiar to all.\r\n\r\n(M125)\r\n\r\nAfter a feeble attempt to capture Northampton, the barons, with\r\nFitz-Walter at their head, accepted an invitation from the citizens of\r\nLondon to enter the city. They made their entry through Aldgate.(190)\r\n\r\nThe concession which John had recently made to the citizens, viz.:--the\r\nright of annually electing their own mayor(191)--had failed to secure their\r\nallegiance. The city became thenceforth the headquarters of the\r\nbarons,(192) and the adhesion of the Londoners was followed by so great a\r\ndefection from the King's party (including among others that of Henry de\r\nCornhill), that he was left without any power of resistance.(193)\r\n\r\n(M126)\r\n\r\nThe citizens met their reward for fidelity to the barons when John was\r\nbrought to bay at Runnymede. In drafting the articles of the Great Charter\r\nthe barons, mindful of their trusty allies, made provision for the\r\npreservation of the city's liberties, and the names of Fitz-Walter and of\r\nthe mayor of the city appear among those who were specially appointed to\r\nsee that the terms of the charter were strictly carried out.(194)\r\n\r\nBy way of further security for the fulfilment of the articles of the\r\ncharter the barons demanded and obtained the custody of the City of\r\nLondon, including the Tower, and they reserved to themselves the right of\r\nmaking war upon the king if he failed to keep his word. For a year or more\r\nthe barons remained in the city, having entered into a mutual compact with\r\nthe inhabitants to make no terms with the king without the consent of both\r\nparties.(195)\r\n\r\n(M127)\r\n\r\nThe right of resistance thus established was soon to be carried into\r\nexecution. Before the year was out, John had broken faith, and was\r\nbesieging Rochester with the aid of mercenaries. An attempt to raise the\r\nsiege failed, owing to the timidity (not to say cowardice) of Fitz-Walter,\r\nwho, like the rest of the barons, was inclined to be indolent so soon as\r\nthe struggle with the king was thought to have ended.(196)\r\n\r\n(M128)\r\n\r\nThe Pope supported his vassal king. For a second time during John's reign\r\nLondon was placed under an interdict. The first occasion was in 1208, when\r\nthe whole of England was put under an interdict, and for six years the\r\nnation was deprived of all religious rites saving the sacraments of\r\nbaptism and extreme unction.(197) It was then the object of Innocent to\r\nstir up resistance against John by inflicting sufferings on the people,\r\nnow his purpose was to punish the people for having risen against John.\r\n\r\n(M129) (M130)\r\n\r\nThe barons saw no other course open to them but to invite Louis the\r\nDauphin to come and undertake the government of the kingdom in the place\r\nof John. On the 21st May, 1216, Louis landed at Sandwich and came to\r\nLondon, where he was welcomed by the barons. Both barons and citizens paid\r\nhim homage, whilst he, on his part, swore to restore to them their rights,\r\nto maintain such laws of the realm as were good, and to abolish those (if\r\nany) that were bad.(198) Suspicion, however, had been aroused against\r\nLouis by the confession of a French nobleman who had come over in his\r\ntrain, and who had solemnly declared on his deathbed that his master had\r\nsworn when once on the throne of England to banish all John's\r\nenemies.(199) Just when matters seemed to be approaching a crisis and the\r\nbarons were wavering in their allegiance, John died (19th October, 1216).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(M131)\r\n\r\nAlthough London remained faithful to Louis after John's death, the barons\r\nbegan to desert him, one by one (_quasi stillatim_),(200) and to transfer\r\ntheir allegiance to John's eldest son, a boy of nine years of age, who had\r\nbeen crowned at Gloucester soon after his father's death, the disturbed\r\nstate of the country not allowing of his coming to London for the\r\nceremony.(201)\r\n\r\n(M132)\r\n\r\nAfter his defeat at Lincoln (20th May, 1217), by William the Marshal, Earl\r\nof Pembroke, one of Henry's guardians, Louis beat a hasty retreat to\r\nLondon and wrote to his father, the French king, to send him military\r\nassistance, for without it he could neither fight nor get out of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n(M133)\r\n\r\nAmong the prisoners taken at Lincoln were Robert Fitz-Walter, and a\r\nneighbour of his in the ward of Castle Baynard, Richard de Muntfichet,\r\nwho, like Fitz-Walter, had also suffered banishment in 1213. The tower or\r\ncastle of Muntfichet lay a little to the west of Baynard's Castle, and was\r\nmade over in 1276 by Gregory de Rokesle, the mayor, and citizens of London\r\nto the Archbishop of Canterbury, for the purpose of erecting a new house\r\nfor the Dominican or Black Friars, in place of their old house in\r\nHolborn.(202) We hear little of Fitz-Walter after this, beyond the facts\r\nthat he soon afterwards obtained his freedom, that he went on a crusade,\r\nand continued a loyal subject to Henry until his death in 1235. He is said\r\nto have been in the habit of wearing a precious stone suspended from his\r\nneck by way of a charm, which at his last moments he asked his wife to\r\nremove in order that he might die the easier.(203)\r\n\r\n(M134)\r\n\r\nA French fleet which had been despatched in answer to Louis was defeated\r\noff Dover by Hubert de Burgh, who had gallantly held that town for John,\r\nand continued to hold it now for Henry. London itself was invested by the\r\nMarshal, and threatened with starvation; but before matters came to\r\nextremes, Louis intimated his willingness to come to terms.(204)\r\n\r\n(M135)\r\n\r\nA meeting was held on the 11th of September (some say at Kingston,(205)\r\nothers at Staines(206)), and a peace concluded.(207) Louis swore fealty to\r\nthe Pope and the Roman Church, for which he was absolved from the ban of\r\nexcommunication that had been passed on him, and surrendered all the\r\ncastles and towns he had taken during the war. He, further, promised to\r\nuse his influence to obtain the restoration to England of the possessions\r\nthat had been lost beyond the sea.\r\n\r\n(M136)\r\n\r\nHenry, on his part, swore to preserve to the barons and the rest of the\r\nkingdom, all those liberties which they had succeeded in obtaining from\r\nJohn. Everything being thus amicably settled, Louis went to London, and,\r\nafter borrowing a large sum of money from his former trusty supporters,\r\nbetook himself back to his native country.(208) The general pardon which\r\nwas granted by the young king extended to the Londoners, who became\r\nreconciled and received back their lands,(209) but did not extend to the\r\nclergy, who were left to the tender mercy of the papal legate.\r\n\r\n(M137)\r\n\r\nFor some years to come there remained a party in the city who cherished\r\nthe memory of Louis, and the cry of \"Mountjoy!\" the war-cry of the French\r\nking--was sufficient to cause a riot as late as 1222, when Constantine\r\nFitz-Athulf or Olaf, an ex-sheriff of London, raised the cry at a\r\ntournament, in order to test the feeling of the populace towards Louis.\r\nAny serious results that might have arisen were promptly prevented by\r\nHubert de Burgh, the justiciar, who very quickly sought out the\r\nringleader, and incontinently caused him and two of his followers to be\r\nhanged at the Elms in Smithfield. Whilst the halter was round his neck,\r\nFitz-Athulf offered 15,000 marks of silver for his life. The offer was\r\ndeclined. He was not to be allowed another chance of stirring up sedition\r\nin the city.(210)\r\n\r\nA more circumstantial account of this event is given us by another\r\nchronicler,(211) who relates that the wrestling match which took place on\r\nthe festival of Saint James (25th July),--the same as that mentioned by\r\nMatthew Paris--was held at Queen Matilda's hospital in the suburbs,(212)\r\nand was a match between the citizens of London and those outside; that\r\nvictory declared itself in favour of the Londoners, and that their\r\nopponents, and among them the steward of the Abbot of Westminster,\r\nthereupon left in high dudgeon. With thoughts of revenge in their hearts,\r\nthe latter caused invitations to be issued for another match to be held at\r\nWestminster, on the following feast of Saint Peter ad Vincula (1st\r\nAugust).\r\n\r\nIt was at this second and later match that the trouble began. The steward\r\nwas not content with collecting the most powerful athletes he could find,\r\nbut caused them to seize weapons and to attack the defenceless citizens\r\nwho had come to take part in the games. The Londoners hurried home,\r\nbleeding with wounds, and immediately took counsel as to what was best to\r\nbe done. Serlo, the mercer, who had held the office of mayor of the city\r\nfor the past five years, and was of a peaceable disposition, suggested\r\nreferring the matter to the abbot; and it was then that Constantine, who\r\nhad a large following, advocated an attack upon the houses of the abbot\r\nand of his steward. No sooner said than done, and many houses had already\r\nsuffered before the justiciar appeared upon the scene with a large force.\r\nAs to the seizure of Constantine and his subsequent execution, the\r\nchroniclers agree.\r\n\r\nConstantine's fellow citizens were very indignant at the indecent haste\r\nwith which the justiciar had caused his execution to be carried out, and\r\ndid not fail to bring the matter up in judgment against him, when, some\r\nten years later, Hubert de Burgh himself fell into disgrace.(213) The\r\nresult was, that the justiciar took refuge in the Priory of Merton. When\r\nthe citizens received the king's orders to follow him there, and to take\r\nhim dead or alive, they obeyed with unconcealed joy. They allowed little\r\ntime to elapse, but set out at once, 20,000 strong, ready to tear him limb\r\nfrom limb; but luckily they were stopped in time by another message from\r\nthe king, and Hubert obtained a respite.(214)\r\n\r\n(M138)\r\n\r\nAt the time of Constantine's execution, there was real danger to be\r\nanticipated from raising the cry in favour of any foreigner. The land was\r\nalready swarming with foreigners, and in that very year (viz. 1222), the\r\narchbishop had been under the necessity of summoning a council of bishops\r\nand nobles to be held in London, owing to dissensions that had arisen\r\nbetween the Earl of Chester, William of Salisbury, the king's uncle, and\r\nHubert de Burgh, and to a rumour that had got abroad, that foreigners were\r\ninciting the Earl of Chester to raise an insurrection.(215)\r\n\r\nA few years later, the country was over-run by a brood of Italian usurers\r\nwho battened on the inhabitants, reducing many to beggary. When attempts\r\nwere made to rid the city of these pests, they sheltered themselves under\r\nthe protection of the Pope.(216)\r\n\r\nThroughout the reign of Henry III, there was one continuous struggle\r\nagainst foreign dominion, either secular or ecclesiastical. In this\r\nstruggle, none took a more active part than the citizens of London, and\r\n\"when [in 1247], the nobles, clergy, and people of England put forth their\r\nfamous letter denouncing the wrongs which England suffered at the hands of\r\nthe Roman bishop, it was with the seal of the city of London, as the\r\ncentre of national life that the national protest was made.\"(217)\r\n\r\n(M139)\r\n\r\nSide by side with this struggle another was being carried on, a struggle\r\nfor the liberty of the subject against the tyranny and rapacity of the\r\nking. More especially was this the case with the city. Henry was for ever\r\ninvading the rights and liberties of the citizens. Thus in 1239, he\r\ninsisted upon their admitting to the shrievalty one who had already been\r\ndismissed from that office for irregular conduct, and because they refused\r\nto forego their chartered right of election and to appoint the king's\r\nnominee, the city was deprived of a mayor for three months and more.(218)\r\n\r\n(M140)\r\n\r\nThe substitution of a _custos_ or warden appointed by the king for a mayor\r\nelected by the citizens, and of bailiffs for sheriffs,--a procedure known\r\nas \"taking the city into the king's hands,\"--was frequently resorted to\r\nboth by Henry and his successors, and notably by Edward I, in whose reign\r\nthe city was deprived of its mayor, and remained under government of a\r\n_custos_ for thirteen consecutive years (1285-1298).(219)\r\n\r\nAny pretext was sufficient for Henry's purpose. If the citizens harboured\r\na foreigner without warrant, not only was the city taken into the king's\r\nhand, but the citizens were fined L1,000,(220) a sum equal to at least\r\nL20,000 at the present day. A widow brings an action for a third part of\r\nher late husband's goods in addition to her dower. The case goes against\r\nher in the Court of Husting, and is heard on appeal before the king's\r\njusticiar sitting at St. Martin's-le-Grand. The verdict is not set aside,\r\nbut some flaw is discovered in the mode of procedure; the explanation of\r\nthe citizens is deemed insufficient, and the mayor and sheriffs are\r\nforthwith deposed, to be reinstated only on the understanding that they\r\nwill so far forego their chartered right--viz.: of not impleading nor being\r\nimpleaded without the walls of their city--as to consent to attend the\r\nking's court at Westminster, where finally, and after considerable delay,\r\nthey are acquitted.(221)\r\n\r\nTake another instance. The king had shown an interest in the Abbey Church\r\nof Westminster, and had caused a new chapel to be built in 1220, he\r\nhimself laying the first stone. Thirty years later, or thereabouts, he\r\nmade certain concessions to the Abbot of Westminster--what they were we are\r\nnot told--but it is certain that they, in some way or other, infringed the\r\nrights of the citizens of London in the County of Middlesex. The king\r\npromised to compensate them for the loss they would sustain; but failing\r\nto get their consent by fair promises, he resorted to his favourite\r\nmeasure of taking the city into his own hands. For fifteen years the\r\ndispute between the citizens and the Abbot as to their respective rights\r\nin the County of Middlesex was kept alive, and was at last determined by a\r\nverdict given by the barons of the exchequer, which completely\r\njustified(222) the attitude taken up by the citizens of London.\r\n\r\n(M141)\r\n\r\nIn 1230 he extorted a large sum of money from the citizens at a time when\r\nhe was meditating an expedition to the continent for the purpose of\r\nrecovering lost possessions. The citizens, however, were not the only\r\nsufferers. The religious houses were heavily mulcted, as were also the\r\nJews, who, whether they would or not, were made to give up one third of\r\ntheir chattels.(223) Again in 1244, the citizens of London and the Jews\r\nwere made to open their purse-strings that the king might the better be\r\nable to pay his wine merchant, his wax chandler, and his tailor; but even\r\nthen his creditors were not paid in full.(224)\r\n\r\nOnly once does it appear that the king's conscience pricked him for the\r\nextortions he was continually practising on the citizens. This was in\r\n1250, when he called the citizens together at Westminster, and begged\r\ntheir forgiveness for all trespasses, extortions of goods and victuals\r\nunder the name of \"prises,\" and for forced loans or talliages. Seeing no\r\nother way out of it, the citizens acceded to his request.(225) As recently\r\nas the previous year (1249) he had exacted from them a sum of L2,000.(226)\r\n\r\n(M142)\r\n\r\nHenry had been crowned at Gloucester soon after his accession.(227)\r\nNevertheless he was again crowned--this time in London in 1236, after his\r\nmarriage with Eleanor of Provence. The city excelled itself in doing\r\nhonour to the king and queen as they passed on their way to Westminster:\r\nbut the joy of the citizens was damped by the king refusing to allow\r\nAndrew Bukerel the mayor to perform the customary service of assisting the\r\nchief butler at the coronation banquet. It was not a time for raising\r\nquestions of etiquette, so the mayor pocketed the affront, preferring to\r\nsettle the question of the city's rights at some more convenient time,\r\nrather than damp the general joy of the company by pressing his\r\nclaim.(228)\r\n\r\n(M143)\r\n\r\nYet, notwithstanding his manifestly unjust treatment of the citizens of\r\nLondon, and the cynical contempt with which he looked upon their ancient\r\nclaim to the title of \"barons,\" he usually went through the formality of\r\ntaking leave of them at Paul's Cross or at Westminster, before crossing\r\nthe sea to Gascony(229) and was not above making use of them when\r\ncompelled to sell his plate and jewels to satisfy his debts. In 1252, he\r\neven went so far as to grant them a charter of liberties, but for this\r\nconcession the citizens had to pay 500 marks.(230)\r\n\r\n(M144)\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely to be wondered at if, when the crisis arrived, and king and\r\nbarons found themselves in avowed hostility, the citizens of London joined\r\nthe popular cause. By the month of June, 1258, the barons had gained their\r\nfirst victory over Henry. He was forced to accept the Provisions of\r\nOxford, passed by the Mad Parliament,(231) as it came to be called in\r\nderision. The Tower of London was transferred to the custody of the\r\nbarons, and they were for the future to appoint the justiciar. Towards the\r\nend of July, a deputation from the barons waited upon the mayor and\r\ncitizens to learn if they approved of the agreement that had been made\r\nwith the king.(232)\r\n\r\n(M145)\r\n\r\nThe mayor, aldermen, and citizens, after a hasty consultation, gave their\r\nassent, but with the reservation \"saving unto them all their liberties and\r\ncustoms,\" and the city's common seal was set to the so-called \"charter\"\r\nwhich the deputation had brought.\r\n\r\n(M146)\r\n\r\nIt was not long before the city discovered that the barons were as little\r\nlikely to respect its liberties as the king himself. Hugh Bigod, whom they\r\nhad appointed justiciar gave offence by the way he exercised his office.\r\nIn spite of all remonstrance he insisted upon sitting at the Guildhall to\r\nhear pleas, a jurisdiction which belonged exclusively to the sheriffs. He\r\nsummoned the bakers of the city to appear before him, and those who were\r\nconvicted of selling bread under weight he punished, in a way that was not\r\nin conformity with city usage.(233)\r\n\r\n(M147)\r\n\r\nIn November of the following year (1259), Henry took occasion of his\r\ndeparture for the continent to make some popular concessions to the\r\ncitizens. He appeared at a Folkmote, which was being held at Paul's Cross,\r\nand, before taking leave, he announced that in future the citizens should\r\nbe allowed to plead their own cases (without employing legal aid) in all\r\nthe courts of the city, excepting in pleas of the crown, pleas of land,\r\nand of wrongful distress. On the same day John Mansel who had been one of\r\nthe king's justiciars in 1257, when the city was \"taken into the king's\r\nhand,\" and Fitz-Thedmar had been indicted and deprived of his aldermanry\r\nfor upholding the privileges of the citizens(234)--publicly acknowledged on\r\nthe king's behalf the injustice of Fitz-Thedmar's indictment, and\r\nannounced that Henry not only recalled him to favour, but commanded that\r\nhe should be restored to his former position.(235)\r\n\r\n(M148)\r\n\r\nDuring the king's absence abroad, the barons' cause was materially\r\nstrengthened by the support afforded Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester,\r\nby the king's son. Upon hearing of the defection of his son, Henry hurried\r\nback to England. A consultation took place in the city as to the attitude\r\nwhich the citizens ought to take up, with the result that when Henry\r\nappeared (April, 1260), both he and the Earl of Gloucester were admitted\r\ninto the city, whilst the Earl of Leicester and \"Sir Edward,\" as the\r\nchronicler styles the king's son, had to find accommodation in the\r\nsuburbs.(236)\r\n\r\nHenry was now master of the situation. The city was his, and he determined\r\nthat it should remain so. Strict watch was kept over the gates, which for\r\nthe most part, were kept shut night and day in order to prevent surprise.\r\nEvery inhabitant of the age of twelve years and upwards was called upon to\r\ntake an oath of allegiance before the alderman of his ward, and those of\r\nmaturer age were bound to provide themselves with arms. The king, who now\r\nruled again in his own way, stirred the anger of the barons, by presuming\r\nto appoint Philip Basset, his chief justiciar, without first asking their\r\nassent; and the barons retaliated by removing the king's sheriffs, and\r\nappointing \"wardens of the counties\" in their stead.(237) In June 1261,\r\nHenry produced a Bull of Alexander IV, annulling the Provisions of Oxford,\r\nand freeing him from his oath.(238)\r\n\r\n(M149)\r\n\r\nFor eighteen months the king reigned supreme. The barons could do nothing,\r\nand the Earl of Leicester, finding their cause hopeless, withdrew in\r\nAugust (1261) to France, and remained there until the spring of 1263, when\r\nhe returned as the unquestioned head of the baronial party, to take up\r\narms against the king. The citizens professed loyalty to Henry, who was\r\nresiding in the Tower, and bound themselves by oath to acknowledge his son\r\nEdward as heir to the crown.(239) At Whitsuntide, the barons sent a letter\r\nto the king requiring him to observe the Provisions of Oxford, and shortly\r\nafterwards, addressed another letter to the citizens \"desiring to be\r\ncertified by them whether they would observe the said ordinances and\r\nstatutes made to the honour of God in fealty to his lordship the king, and\r\nto his advantage of all the realm, or would, in preference, adhere to\r\nthose who wished to infringe the same.\"(240)\r\n\r\n(M150)\r\n\r\nBefore sending a reply, the citizens had an interview with the king in the\r\nTower, to whom they showed the barons' letter. The result was, that Henry\r\navailed himself of their services to mediate between him and the barons. A\r\ndeputation of citizens accordingly travelled to Dover, where an\r\nunderstanding was arrived at between the hostile parties. The citizens\r\nwere prepared to support the barons, subject to their fealty to the king\r\nand saving their own liberties; whilst the king promised to dismiss his\r\nforeign supporters--the real cause of all the mischief. Hugh le Despenser,\r\nwhom Henry had deposed, was again installed justiciar of all England in\r\nthe Tower; and the king and his family left the city for Westminster, the\r\nday after the barons entered it. \"Thus was a league made between the\r\nbarons and the citizens with this reservation--'saving fealty to his\r\nlordship the king.'\"(241)\r\n\r\n(M151)\r\n\r\nWhilst the commons of England were thus winning their way to liberty, the\r\ncommons of the city were engaged in a similar struggle with the\r\naristocratic element of the municipal government.  The craft guilds cried\r\nout against the exclusiveness of the more wealthy and aristocratic trade\r\nguilds, the members of which monopolized the city's rule. They found an\r\nable champion of their cause in the person of Thomas Fitz-Thomas, the\r\nmayor for the time being (1261-1265). The mayor's action in the matter\r\ndisgusted Fitz-Thedmar, the city alderman and chronicler, who complains\r\nthat he \"so pampered the city populace,\" that they styled themselves the\r\n\"commons of the city,\" and had obtained the first voice in the city. The\r\nmayor would ask them their will as to whether this or that thing should be\r\ndone; and if they answered \"ya\" \"ya,\" it was done, without consulting the\r\naldermen or chief citizens, whose very existence was ignored.(242) It is\r\nnot surprising that, under a mayor so thoroughly in sympathy with the\r\npeople, opportunity was taken by the citizens to rectify abuses from which\r\nthey had so long suffered. Their trade had been prejudiced by the number\r\nof foreigners which the king had introduced into the city, and accordingly\r\nwe read of an attack made on the houses of some French merchants. Rights\r\nof way which had been stopped up, were again opened, and where land had\r\nbeen illegally built upon, the buildings were abated.\r\n\r\nThe chronicler complains of the populace acting \"like so many justices\r\nitinerant.\" It was in vain that the king addressed a letter to the mayor\r\nand citizens, setting forth that the dissensions between himself and the\r\nbarons had been settled, and commanding his peace to be kept as well\r\nwithin the city as without.(243)\r\n\r\n(M152)\r\n\r\nThe popular movement received every encouragement from the barons. Let\r\nthose who were disaffected put their complaints into writing, and the\r\nbarons would see that the matter was duly laid before the king, and that\r\nthe city's liberties were not diminished. Fortified with such promises,\r\nthe mayor set to work at once to organize the craft guilds. Ordinances\r\nwere drawn up \"abominations\" Fitz-Thedmar calls them(244) for the\r\namelioration of the members, and everything was done that could be done to\r\nbetter their condition.\r\n\r\n(M153)\r\n\r\nA few days before Henry and the barons had concluded a temporary peace,\r\nthe citizens had been greatly excited by an action of the king's son.\r\nHenry was, as usual, in want of money, and had failed to raise a loan in\r\nthe city. His son came to his assistance and seized the money and jewels\r\nlying at the Temple (29th June). The citizens were so exasperated at this\r\nhigh-handed proceeding on the part of the prince that they vented their\r\nspleen on the queen, and pelted her with mud and stones, calling her all\r\nkinds of opprobrious names, as she attempted to pass in her barge under\r\nLondon Bridge on her way from the Tower to Windsor. (13th July).(245)\r\n\r\nSuch conduct very naturally incensed the king and his son against the\r\ncitizens. Henry was angry with them, moreover, for having admitted the\r\nbarons contrary to his express orders.(246) It is not surprising,\r\ntherefore, that when Fitz-Thomas presented himself before the Barons of\r\nthe Exchequer to be admitted to the mayoralty for the third year in\r\nsuccession, they refused to admit him by the king's orders, Henry \"being\r\nfor many reasons greatly moved to anger against the city.\"(247)\r\n\r\n(M154)\r\n\r\nBefore the end of the year (1263), both king and barons agreed to submit\r\nto the arbitration of the King of France. The award known as the Mise of\r\nAmien--from the place whence it was issue--which Louis made on the 23rd\r\nJan., 1264, proved of so one-sided a character that the barons had no\r\nalternative but to reject it. However unjustifiable such repudiation on\r\nthe part of the barons may have been from a moral point of view, it was a\r\nmatter of necessity. Many of them, moreover, including those of the Cinque\r\nPorts, as well as the Londoners, and nearly all the middle class of\r\nEngland, had not been parties to the arbitration, and therefore, were not\r\npledged to accept the award.(248)\r\n\r\n(M155)\r\n\r\nThe citizens and the barons now entered into solemn covenant to stand by\r\neach other \"saving however their fealty to the king.\" A constable and a\r\nmarshal were appointed to command the city force, which was to stand\r\nprepared night and day to muster at the sound of the great bell of St.\r\nPaul's. The manor of Isleworth, belonging to Richard, King of the Romans,\r\nthe king's brother, was laid waste, and Rochester besieged, but,\r\ndisturbances again breaking out at home, Leicester had to hurry back to\r\nrestore order and prevent the city being betrayed to the king's son.(249)\r\n\r\n(M156)\r\n\r\nIn May the earl set out again with a force of Londoners(250) to meet the\r\nking, who was threatening the Cinque Ports. In the early morning of the\r\n14th he came upon the royal army at Lewes. Prince Edward himself led the\r\ncharge against the Londoners--he had not forgotten the insult they had\r\nrecently offered to his mother--and succeeded in driving them off the\r\nfield. They scarcely indeed awaited his onslaught, so unpractised in\r\nwarfare had they become of recent years, but turned their backs and sped\r\naway towards London, followed in hot pursuit by Edward. When he returned\r\nhe found that, owing to his absence, the day was lost, and that his father\r\nand brother had been made prisoners.(251) In spite of his own success, he\r\nalso had to surrender.\r\n\r\n(M157)\r\n\r\nThe barons returned to the city in triumph, bringing the king and Richard,\r\nking of the Romans, in their train. Edward had been placed in custody in\r\nDover Castle, pending negotiations. Henry was lodged in the Bishop's\r\nPalace, whilst Richard was committed to the Tower. An agreement was drawn\r\nup which secured the safety of the king, and left all matters of dispute\r\nto be again referred to arbitration.(252) This treaty formed the basis of\r\na new system of government, and led to the institution of Simon de\r\nMontfort's famous Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe short respite--for it proved to be no more--from civil war was welcomed\r\nby the Londoners. The city had been drained of a large part of its\r\npopulation in order to increase the Earl of Leicester's army, and business\r\nhad been seriously disturbed. For the past year no Court of Husting had\r\nbeen held, and therefore no wills or testaments had received probate;\r\nwhilst all pleas of land, except trespass, had to stand over until the\r\ncountry became more settled.(253)\r\n\r\n(M158)\r\n\r\nThe parliament which Leicester summoned to meet on the 20th January, 1265,\r\nmarked a new era in parliamentary representation. It was the first\r\nparliament in which the merchant and the trader were invited to take their\r\nseats beside the baron and bishop. Not only were the shires to send up two\r\nrepresentatives, but each borough and town were to be similarly\r\nprivileged.(254)\r\n\r\nTerms of reconciliation between king and barons were arranged, and once\r\nmore the mayor and aldermen did fealty to Henry in person in St. Paul's\r\nchurch. Fitz-Thomas, who for the fourth time was mayor, was determined to\r\nlose nothing of his character for independence; \"My lord,\" said he, when\r\ntaking the oath, so long as you are willing to be to us a good king and\r\nlord, we will be to you faithful and true.\"(255)\r\n\r\n(M159)\r\n\r\nPeace was not destined to last long. Dissensions quickly broke out between\r\nGilbert, Earl of Gloucester, and Simon de Montfort, owing in a great\r\nmeasure to jealousy. Gloucester insisted that the Mise of Lewes and the\r\nProvisions of Oxford had not been properly observed, hinting unmistakably\r\nat the foreign birth and extraction of his rival. Endeavours were made to\r\narrange matters by arbitration, but in vain; and by Whitsuntide the two\r\nearls were in open hostility. Gloucester was joined by Edward, who had\r\nsucceeded by a ruse in escaping from Hereford, where he was detained in\r\nhonourable captivity.(256)\r\n\r\n(M160)\r\n\r\nWith their combined forces they fell on Earl Simon at Evesham and utterly\r\ndefeated him (4 Aug.). Simon himself was killed, and his body barbarously\r\nmutilated.(257) The king, who was in the earl's camp, only saved himself\r\nby crying out in time \"I am Henry of Winchester, your king.\" Whilst the\r\nbattle was raging the city was visited with a terrible thunderstorm--an\r\nevil omen of the future.\r\n\r\nIf credit be given to every statement made by the city alderman and\r\nchronicler, Fitz-Thedmar, we must believe that the battle of Evesham took\r\nplace just in time to prevent a wholesale massacre of the best and\r\nforemost men of the city, including the chronicler himself, which was\r\nbeing contrived by the mayor, the popular Thomas Fitz-Thomas, the no less\r\npopular Thomas de Piwelesdon or Puleston, and others.(258)\r\n\r\n(M161)\r\n\r\nThe citizens of London were soon to experience the change that had taken\r\nplace in the state of affairs. The day after Michaelmas, the mayor and\r\ncitizens proceeded to Westminster to present the new sheriffs to the\r\nBarons of the Exchequer; but finding no one there, they returned home. The\r\ntruth was that the king had resorted to his favourite measure of taking\r\nthe city into his own hands for its adherence to the late Earl of\r\nLeicester; and for five years it so remained, being governed by a _custos_\r\nor warden appointed by the king, in the place of a mayor elected by the\r\ncitizens.(259)\r\n\r\n(M162)\r\n\r\nThere had been some talk of the king meditating an attack upon the city,\r\nand treating its inhabitants as avowed enemies.(260) The very threat of\r\nsuch a proceeding was sufficient to throw the city into the utmost state\r\nof confusion. Some there were \"fools and evil-minded persons,\" as our\r\nchronicler describes them--who favoured resisting force by force; but the\r\n\"most discreet men\" of the city, and those who had joined the Earl under\r\ncompulsion, would have none of it, preferring to solicit the king's favour\r\nthrough the mediation of men of the religious orders. Henry still remained\r\nunmoved, and the fear of the citizens increased to such an extent that it\r\nwas finally resolved that the citizens as a body should make humble\r\nsubmission to the king; and that the same should be forwarded to him at\r\nWindsor under the common seal of the city. Whilst the deputation bearing\r\nthis document was on its way it was met by Sir Roger de Leiburn, who\r\nturned it back on the ground that he himself was on his way to the city\r\nfor the express purpose of arranging terms of submission.(261)\r\n\r\n(M163)\r\n\r\nThat night Sir Roger lodged at the Tower, and the next morning he went to\r\nBarking Church, on the confines of the city,(262) where he was met by the\r\nmayor and a \"countless multitude\" of the citizens. The advice he had to\r\ngive the citizens was that if they wished to be reconciled to the king,\r\nthey would have to submit their lives and property unreservedly to his\r\nwill. Letters patent were drawn up to that effect under the common seal,\r\nand taken by Sir Roger himself to Windsor. The citizens had not long to\r\nwait for an answer. The king's first demand was the removal of the posts\r\nand chains which had been set up in the streets as a means of defence. His\r\nnext was that the mayor--his old antagonist Fitz-Thomas--and the principal\r\nmen of the city should come in person to him at Windsor, under letters of\r\nsafe conduct. Trusting to the royal word, the mayor and about forty of the\r\nmore substantial men of the city proceeded to Windsor, there to await a\r\nconference with the king. To their great surprise, the whole of the party\r\nwere made to pass the night in the Castle keep. They were practically\r\ntreated as prisoners.\r\n\r\n(M164)\r\n\r\nSome regained their liberty, but of Fitz-Thomas nothing more is heard.\r\nFrom the time that he entered Windsor Castle, he disappears from public\r\nview. That he was alive in May, 1266, at least in the belief of his\r\nfellow-citizens, is shown by their cry for the release of him and his\r\ncompanions \"who are at Windleshores.\" They would again have made him\r\nMayor, if they could have had their own way. \"We will have no one for\r\nmayor\" (they cried) \"save only Thomas Fitz-Thomas.\"(263)\r\n\r\n(M165)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the king had himself gone to London and confiscated the\r\nproperty of more than sixty of the citizens, driving them out of their\r\nhouse and home. Hugh Fitz-Otes, the Constable of the Tower, had been\r\nappointed warden of the city in the place of the imprisoned mayor;\r\nbailiffs had been substituted for sheriffs, and the citizens made to pay a\r\nfine of 20,000 marks. Then, and only then, did the king consent to grant\r\ntheir pardon.(264)\r\n\r\n(M166)\r\n\r\nQueen Eleanor, who had interceded for the Londoners,(265) was presented by\r\nthe king with the custody of London Bridge, the issues and profits of\r\nwhich she was allowed to enjoy. She allowed the bridge, however, to fall\r\ninto such decay, that she thought she could not do better than restore it\r\nto its rightful owners. This she accordingly did in 1271, but soon\r\nafterwards changed her mind, and again took the bridge into her\r\ncharge.(266)\r\n\r\n(M167)\r\n\r\nAt Easter, 1267, the Earl of Gloucester, who had constituted himself the\r\navowed champion of those who had suffered forfeiture, and become\r\n\"disinherited\" for the part they had taken with the Earl of Leicester,\r\nsought admission to the city. The citizens hesitated to receive him within\r\ntheir gates, although according to some, he was armed with letters patent\r\nof the king addressed to the citizens on his behalf.(267) Under pretence\r\nof holding a conference with the papal legate at the Church of Holy\r\nTrinity, Aldgate, he gained admission for himself and followers: and there\r\nhe remained, having made himself master of the city's gates.(268)\r\nThereupon many citizens left the city, fearing the wrath of the king, and\r\nonce more the city was in the hands of the populace. The leading citizens\r\nwere placed under a guard; the aldermen and bailiffs were deposed to make\r\nway for the earl's own supporters, and, for better security, a covered way\r\nof timber was made from the city to the Tower.(269)\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the actual part played by the legate in admitting\r\nthe disinherited into the city, he soon showed his dissatisfaction at the\r\nstate of things within its walls, by leaving the Tower, to join the king\r\nat Ham, and placing the disinherited--\"the enemies of the king\"--under an\r\ninterdict.(270)\r\n\r\n(M168)\r\n\r\nAt length the king and the Earl of Gloucester came to terms (16 June). The\r\nearl was to have his property restored to him, and the city was to be\r\nforgiven all trespasses committed against the king since the time that the\r\nearl made his sojourn within its walls. The earl gave surety in 10,000\r\nmarks for keeping the peace, and the citizens paid the king of the Romans\r\n1,000 marks for damages they had committed three years before in his manor\r\nof Isleworth.(271) Not a word about the imprisoned mayor, Fitz-Thomas!\r\n\r\n(M169)\r\n\r\nThe king's letters patent granting forgiveness to the citizens for\r\nharbouring the Earl of Gloucester(272) were followed in the spring of the\r\nfollowing year by another charter to the city.(273) But inasmuch as this\r\ncharter did not restore the mayoralty, the citizens had little cause to be\r\nthankful and looked upon it as only an instalment of favours to come.\r\n\r\n(M170)\r\n\r\nTowards the end of this year or early in the next (1269), the city was\r\ncommitted by the king to his son Edward, who ruled it by deputy, Sir Hugh\r\nFitz-Otes being again appointed Constable of the Tower, and warden of the\r\ncity.(274) It was through the good offices of the prince, that the\r\ncitizens eventually recovered the right to elect their mayor, so long\r\nwithheld. \"About the same time, that is to say, Pentecost, 1270,\" writes\r\nFitz-Thedmar, \"at the instance of Sir Edward, his lordship the king\r\ngranted unto the citizens that they might have a mayor from among\r\nthemselves in such form as they were wont to elect him.\"(275)\r\n\r\n(M171)\r\n\r\nHe further allowed them to choose two sheriffs who should discharge the\r\nduties of sheriff, (_qui tenerent vicecomitatem_) of the City and\r\nMiddlesex, as formerly; but instead of the yearly ferm of L300 in pure\r\nsilver (_sterlingorum blancorum_), formerly paid for Middlesex, they were\r\nthenceforth to pay an annual rent of L400 in money counted (_sterlingorum\r\ncomputatorum_.)(276)\r\n\r\n(M172)\r\n\r\nThe citizens lost no time in exercising their recovered rights. Their\r\nchoice fell upon John Adrian for the mayoralty, whilst Philip le Taillour\r\nand Walter le Poter were elected sheriffs. After they had been severally\r\nadmitted into office--the mayor before the king himself on Wednesday, the\r\n16th July, and the sheriffs at the Exchequer two days later--the king\r\nrestored the city's charters, and the citizens acknowledged the royal\r\nfavour by a gift of 100 marks to the king, and 500 marks to Prince Edward,\r\nwho had proved so good a friend to them, and who was about to set out for\r\nthe Holy Land.(277)\r\n\r\n(M173)\r\n\r\nAdrian was succeeded in the mayoralty by Walter Hervy, who had already\r\nserved as sheriff or bailiff on two occasions, once by royal appointment.\r\nHe made himself so popular with the \"commons\" of the city during his year\r\nof office, that when October, 1272, came round and the aldermen and more\r\n\"discreet\" citizens were in favour of electing Philip le Taillour as his\r\nsuccessor, the commons or \"mob of the city\"--as the chronicler prefers to\r\nstyle them--cried out, \"Nay, nay, we will have no one for mayor but Walter\r\nHervi.\"(278)\r\n\r\n(M174)\r\n\r\nThe aldermen finding themselves in a minority, appealed to the king and\r\ncouncil at Westminster. Hervy did the same, being accompanied to\r\nWestminster by a large number of supporters, who took the opportunity of\r\nthe aldermen laying their case before the council to insist loudly, as\r\nthey waited in the adjacent hall, upon their own right of election and\r\ntheir choice of Hervy. It was feared that the noise might disturb the king\r\nwho was confined to his bed with what proved to be his last illness. All\r\nparties was therefore dismissed, injunction being laid upon Hervy not to\r\nappear again with such a following, but to come with only ten or a dozen\r\nsupporters at the most.\r\n\r\n(M175)\r\n\r\nHervy paid no heed to this warning, but continued to present himself at\r\nWestminster every day for a fortnight, accompanied by his supporters in\r\nfull force, expecting an answer to be given by the council. At length the\r\ncouncil resolved to submit the whole question to arbitration, the city in\r\nthe meanwhile being placed in the custody of a warden. Before the\r\narbitrators got to work, the king died (16 Nov.), and rather than the city\r\nshould continue to be disturbed at such a crisis, the aldermen agreed to a\r\ncompromise, and Hervy was allowed to be mayor for one year more.(279)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(M176)\r\n\r\nAlthough the aldermen had been prevailed upon to give their assent to\r\nHervy's election to the mayoralty, his democratic tendencies made him an\r\nobject of dislike, more especially to Fitz-Thomas. When, therefore, that\r\nchronicler records that throughout Hervy's year of office he did not allow\r\nany pleading in the Husting for Pleas of Land except very rarely, for the\r\nreason that the mayor himself was defendant in a suit brought against him\r\nby Isabella Bukerel,(280) we hesitate to place implicit belief in his\r\nstatement.(281) We are inclined, moreover, to give less credit to anything\r\nthat Fitz-Thedmar may say against the mayor when we bear in mind that the\r\nformer had a personal grievance against the latter.(282)\r\n\r\n(M177)\r\n\r\nHervy was a worthy successor to Fitz-Thomas, and, under his government,\r\nthe craft guilds improved their position. Fresh ordinances for the\r\nregulation of various crafts were drawn up, and to these the mayor, on his\r\nown responsibility, attached the city seal.(283) When Hervy's year of\r\noffice expired--these so-called \"charters\" were called in question as\r\nhaving been unauthorised by the aldermen of the city and as tending to\r\nfavour the richer members of the guilds to the prejudice of the poorer.\r\nAfter a \"wordy and most abusive dispute\" carried on in the Guildhall\r\nbetween the ex-mayor and Gregory de Rokesley who acted as spokesman for\r\nthe body of aldermen, Hervy left the hall and summoned the craft-guilds to\r\nmeet him in Cheapside. There he told them that it was the wish of Henry le\r\nGaleys (or Waleys) the mayor and others to infringe their charters, but\r\nthat if they could stand by him he would maintain those charters in all\r\ntheir integrity.\r\n\r\nFearing lest a riot might follow, the chancellor--Walter de Merton, through\r\nwhose mediation Hervy had been at last accepted as mayor by the\r\naldermen--ordered his arrest. This was on the 20th December, 1273. Hervy\r\nwas, accordingly, attached but released on bail, and early in the\r\nfollowing January (1274), his charters were duly examined in the Husting\r\nbefore all the people, and declared void. Thenceforth, every man was to\r\nenjoy the utmost freedom in following his calling, always provided that\r\nhis work was good and lawful.(284)\r\n\r\n(M178)\r\n\r\nWhen the mayor removed certain butchers' and fishmongers' stalls from\r\nCheapside, in order that the main thoroughfare of the city might present a\r\ncreditable appearance to the king on his return from abroad, the owners of\r\nthe stalls, who complained of being disturbed in their freeholds--\"having\r\ngiven to the sheriff a great sum of money for the same\"--found a champion\r\nin Hervy. Their cause was pleaded at the Guildhall, and such \"a wordy\r\nstrife\" arose between Hervy and the mayor, that the session had to be\r\nbroken up, and Hervy's conduct was reported to the king's council. The\r\nnext day, upon the resumption of the session, a certain roll was produced\r\nand publicly read, in which \"the presumptuous acts and injuries, of most\r\nnotorious character\" which Hervy was alleged to have committed during his\r\nmayoralty were set forth at length.\r\n\r\n(M179) (M180)\r\n\r\nThe charges against him were eight in number, of which some at least\r\nappear to be in the last degree frivolous. He had on a certain occasion\r\nborne false witness; he had failed on another occasion to attend at\r\nWestminster upon a summons; he had failed to observe all the assizes made\r\nby the aldermen and had allowed ale to be sold in his ward for three\r\nhalfpence a gallon; he had taken bribes for allowing corn and wine to be\r\ntaken out of the city for sale, and he had misappropriated a sum of money\r\nwhich had been raised for a special purpose. Such was the general run of\r\nthe charges brought against him, in addition to which were the charges of\r\nhaving permitted the guilds to make new statutes to their own advantage\r\nand to the loss of the city and all the realm, as already narrated, and of\r\nhaving procured \"certain persons of the city, of Stebney, of Stratford,\r\nand of Hakeneye\" to make an unjust complaint against the mayor, \"who had\r\nwarranty sufficient for what he had done, namely, the council of his\r\nlordship the king.\" This last charge had reference to the recent removal\r\nof tradesmen's stalls from Chepe. No defence appears to have been allowed\r\nHervy. The charges were read, and he was then and there declared to be\r\n\"judicially degraded from his aldermanry and for ever excluded from the\r\ncouncil of the city\"; a precept being at the same time issued for the\r\nimmediate election of a successor, to be presented at the next court.(285)\r\n\r\n(M181)\r\n\r\nFrom this time forward nothing more is heard of Hervy. The same cloud\r\nenvelopes his later history, that gathered round the last years of his\r\npredecessor and political tutor Thomas Fitz-Thomas. The misfortune of both\r\nof these men was that they lived before their age. Their works bore fruit\r\nlong after they had departed. The trade or craft guilds, as distinguished\r\nfrom the more wealthy and influential mercantile guilds, eventually played\r\nan important part in the city. Under Edward II, no stranger could obtain\r\nthe freedom of the city (without which, he could do little or nothing),\r\nunless he became a member of one of these guilds, or sought the suffrages\r\nof the commonalty of the city, before admission to the freedom in the\r\nCourt of Husting.(286)\r\n\r\nThe normal and more expeditious way of obtaining the freedom was thus\r\nthrough a guild. If Hervy or Fitz-Thomas lived till the year 1319, when\r\nthe Ordinances just cited received the king's sanction, he must have felt\r\nthat the struggle he had made to raise the lesser guilds had not been in\r\nvain. The mercantile element in the city, which had formerly overcome the\r\naristocratic element,(287) in its turn gave way to the numerical\r\nsuperiority and influence of the craft and manufacturing element. Hence it\r\nwas that in 1376--when the number of trade or craft guilds in the city\r\ncompared with the larger mercantile guilds was as forty to eight--the\r\nguilds succeeded in wresting for a while from the wards the right of\r\nelecting members of the city's council.(288)\r\n\r\n(M182)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, King Edward I, arrived in London (18th August, 1274),\r\nwhere he was heartily welcomed by the citizens,(289) and was crowned the\r\nfollowing day. He had expected to have returned much earlier, and had\r\naddressed a letter to the mayor, sheriffs, and commonalty of the City of\r\nLondon, eighteen months before, informing them of his purposed speedy\r\nreturn, and of his wishes that they should endeavour to preserve the peace\r\nof the realm.(290) He was, however, detained in France.\r\n\r\n(M183)\r\n\r\nEdward's right to succeed his father was never disputed. For the first\r\ntime in the annals of England, a new king commences to reign immediately\r\nafter the death of his predecessor. _Le Roi est mort, vive le_ _Roi_!\r\nWithin a week of his father's decease, a writ was issued, in which the\r\nhereditary right of succession was distinctly asserted as forming Edward's\r\ntitle to the crown.(291)\r\n\r\n(M184)\r\n\r\nBefore setting sail for England, Edward despatched a letter (3rd April),\r\n\"to his well-beloved, the mayor, barons, and reputable men of London,\"\r\nthanking them for the preparations he understood they were making for the\r\nceremony of his coronation, and bidding them send a deputation of four of\r\nthe more discreet of the citizens, to him at Paris, for the purpose of a\r\nspecial conference.(292)\r\n\r\n(M185)\r\n\r\nThe difficulty which gave rise to this conference and to the signal mark\r\nof distinction bestowed upon the citizens of London, proved to be of a\r\ncommercial character, and, as such, one upon which the opinions of the\r\nleading merchants of London would be of especial value. Ever since the\r\nyear 1270, the commercial relationship between England and Flanders had\r\nbeen strained. The Countess of Flanders had thought fit to lay hands upon\r\nthe wool and other merchandise belonging to English merchants found within\r\nher dominions, and to appropriate the same to her own use. Edward's\r\npredecessor on the throne had thereupon issued a writ to the mayor and\r\nsheriffs of London, forbidding in future the export of wool to any parts\r\nbeyond sea whatsoever,(293) but this measure not having the desired\r\neffect, he shortly afterwards had recourse to reprisals.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th June, 1270, a writ had been issued to the same parties\r\nordering them to seize the goods of all Flemings, Hainaulters, and other\r\nsubjects of the Countess, for the purpose of satisfying the claims of\r\nEnglish merchants; and all subjects of the Countess, except those workmen\r\nwho had received express permission to come to England for the purpose of\r\nmaking cloth, and those who had taken to themselves English wives, and had\r\nobtained a domicile in this country, were to quit the realm by a certain\r\ndate.(294) Those Flemings who neglected this injunction were to be seized\r\nand kept in custody until further orders, and the same measures were to be\r\ntaken with those who harboured them. In the meantime, an inquisition was\r\nordered to be made as to the amount and value of the goods seized by the\r\nCountess, and the English merchants were to lodge their respective claims\r\nfor compensation.\r\n\r\n(M186)\r\n\r\nThe interruption of trade between England--at that time the chief\r\nwool-exporting country in the world--and Flanders where the cloth-working\r\nindustry especially flourished, caused much tribulation; and the King of\r\nFrance, the Duke of Brabant, and other foreign potentates, whose subjects\r\nbegan to feel the effect of this commercial disturbance, addressed letters\r\nto the King of England, requesting that their merchants might enter his\r\nrealm and stay, and traffic there as formerly. They had never offended the\r\nKing or his people; the Countess of Flanders was the sole offender, and\r\nshe alone ought to be punished. The matter having received due\r\nconsideration, the embargo on the export of wool was taken off with\r\nrespect to all countries, except Flanders, with the proviso that no wool\r\nshould be exported out of the kingdom without special license from the\r\nking.(295)\r\n\r\nBy the month of October, 1271, the inquisitors, who had been appointed to\r\nappraise the goods and chattels of Flemings in England, were able to\r\nreport to parliament that their value amounted to L8,000 \"together with\r\nthe king's debt,\" whilst the value of merchandise belonging to English\r\nmerchants and seized by the countess amounted to L7,000, besides chattels\r\nof other merchants. Parliament again sat in January of the new year to\r\nconsider the claims of English merchants, when those whose goods had been\r\ntaken in Flanders, \"and the Londoners more especially,\" appeared in\r\nperson. Each stated the amount of his loss and the amount of goods\r\nbelonging to Flemings which he had in hand, and a balance was struck. An\r\ninquisition was, at the same time, taken in each of the city wards, as to\r\nthe number of merchants who bought, sold, exchanged, or harboured the\r\ngoods of persons belonging to the dominion of the Countess; and also as to\r\nwho had taken wools out of England to the parts beyond the sea, contrary\r\nto the king's prohibition.(296) Many Flemings, still lurking in the city,\r\nwere arrested, and only liberated on condition they abjured the realm so\r\nlong as the dispute between England and Flanders should continue. Nearly\r\nsix months elapsed before any further steps were taken by either party in\r\nthe strife. The Countess then showed signs of giving way. Envoys from her\r\narrived in England. She was willing to make satisfaction to all English\r\nmerchants for the losses they had sustained, but this was to be subject to\r\nthe condition that the king should bind himself to discharge certain\r\nalleged debts, which had been the cause of all the mischief from the\r\noutset, within a fixed time. In the event of the king failing to discharge\r\nthese claims, the justice of which he never recognised, the Countess was\r\nto be allowed to distrain all persons coming into her country from England\r\nby their bodies and their goods, until satisfaction should be made for\r\narrears. This haughty message only made matters worse. The king and his\r\ncouncil became indignant, and contemptuously dismissed the envoys,\r\ncommanding them to leave England within three days on peril of life and\r\nlimb.(297)\r\n\r\n(M187)\r\n\r\nTime went on; Henry died, and before his son Edward arrived in England\r\nfrom the Holy Land to take up the reins of government, his chancellor,\r\nWalter de Merton, had caused a proclamation to be made throughout the\r\ncity, forbidding any Fleming to enter the kingdom, under penalty of\r\nforfeiture of person and goods. The proclamation was more than ordinarily\r\nstringent, for it went on to say that if perchance any individual had\r\nreceived special permission from the late king to sojourn and to trade\r\nwithin the realm, such permission was no longer to hold good, but the\r\nforeigner was to pack up his merchandise, collect his debts, and leave the\r\ncountry by Christmas, 1273, at the latest.(298)\r\n\r\n(M188)\r\n\r\nThe Countess had probably hoped that a change of monarch on the English\r\nthrone would have favoured her cause. This proclamation was sufficient to\r\nshow her the character of the king with whom she had in future to deal,\r\nand destroyed any hope she may have entertained in this direction. She\r\ntherefore took the opportunity of Edward's passing through Paris to\r\nLondon, to open negotiations for the purpose of restoring peace between\r\nEngland and Flanders; and it was to assist the king in conducting these\r\nnegotiations, that he had summoned a deputation of citizens of London to\r\nmeet him at Paris.\r\n\r\n(M189)\r\n\r\nThe choice of the citizens fell upon Henry le Waleys, their mayor for the\r\ntime being, one who was known almost as well in France as in the city of\r\nLondon, if we may judge from the fact of his filling the office of Mayor\r\nof Bordeaux in the following year. With him were chosen Gregory de\r\nRokesley who, besides being a large dealer in wool, was also a goldsmith\r\nand financier, and as such was shortly to be appointed master of the\r\nexchange throughout England;(299) John Horn, whose name bespeaks his\r\nFlemish origin,(300) and who may on that account have been appointed, as\r\none who was intimate with both sides of the question under discussion; and\r\nLuke de Batencurt, also of foreign extraction, who was one of the Sheriffs\r\nof London this same year.\r\n\r\n(M190)\r\n\r\nThese four accordingly set out to confer with the king at Paris, having\r\npreviously seen to the appointment of wardens over the city, and of\r\nmagistrates to determine complaints which might arise at the fair to be\r\nheld at St. Botolph's, or Boston, in Lincolnshire, during their\r\nabsence.(301) The deputation were absent a month. On the 19th July,\r\nGregory de Rokesle and certain others whose names are not mentioned again\r\nset out in compliance with orders received from the king; the object of\r\ntheir journey being, as we are expressly told, to treat of peace between\r\nthe king and the Countess of Flanders at Montreuil.(302) A month later\r\nEdward himself was in England.\r\n\r\n(M191)\r\n\r\nThe king ruled the city, as indeed he ruled the rest of the kingdom, with\r\na strong hand. Londoners had already experienced the force of his arm and\r\nhis ability in the field, when he scattered them at Lewes; they were now\r\nto experience the benefit of his powers of organization in time of peace.\r\nFitz-Thedmar's chronicle now fails us, but we have a new source of\r\ninformation in the letter books(303) of the Corporation.\r\n\r\n(M192)\r\n\r\nThe first and the most pressing difficulty which presented itself to\r\nEdward, was the re-organization of finance. Without money the barons could\r\nnot be kept within legitimate bounds. Having won their cause against the\r\nusurpations of the crown, they began to turn their arms upon each other,\r\nand it required Edward's strong hand not only to impose order upon his\r\nunruly nobles, but also, to bring Scotland and Wales into submission. The\r\ncountry was flooded with clipt coin. This was called in, and new money\r\nminted at the Tower, under the supervision of Gregory de Rokesley as\r\nMaster of the Exchange.(304) Parliament made large grants to the king; and\r\nhe further increased his resources by imposing knighthood upon all\r\nfreeholders of estates worth L20 a year.(305) When the Welsh war was\r\nrenewed in 1282, the city sent him 6,000 marks by the hands of Waleys and\r\nRokesley.(306)\r\n\r\n(M193)\r\n\r\nIn 1283 an extraordinary assembly--styled a parliament by some\r\nchroniclers--was summoned to meet at Shrewsbury to attend the trial of\r\nDavid, brother of Llewelyn, Prince of Wales. To this so-called parliament\r\nthe city sent no less than six representatives, viz.: Henry le Waleys, the\r\nmayor, Gregory de Rokesley, Philip Cissor, or the tailor, Ralph Crepyn,\r\nJoce le Acatour, or merchant, and John de Gisors.(307) Their names are\r\nworthy of record, inasmuch as they are the first known representatives of\r\nthe city in any assembly deserving the name of a parliament, the names of\r\nthose attending Simon de Montfort's parliament not having been transmitted\r\nto us. David was convicted and barbarously executed, his head being\r\nafterwards carried to London, and set up on the Tower, where his brother's\r\nhead, with a mock crown of ivy, had recently been placed.(308)\r\n\r\n(M194)\r\n\r\nOf Ralph Crepyn, one of the city's representatives at Shrewsbury, a tragic\r\nstory is told. Meeting, one day, Laurence Duket, his rival in the\r\naffections of a woman known as \"Alice atte Bowe,\" the two came to blows,\r\nand Crepyn was wounded. The affray took place in Cheapside, and Duket,\r\nfearing he had killed his man, sought sanctuary in Bow Church. Crepyn's\r\nfriends, hearing of the matter, followed and having killed Duket, disposed\r\nof their victim's body in such a way as to suggest suicide. It so\r\nhappened, however, that the sacrilegious murder had been witnessed by a\r\nboy who informed against the culprits and no less than sixteen persons\r\nwere hanged for the part they had taken in it. Alice, herself, was\r\ncondemned to be burnt alive as being the chief instigator of the murder;\r\nothers, including Ralph Crepyn, were sent to the Tower, and only released\r\non payment of heavy fines.(309) The church was placed under interdict, the\r\ndoors and windows being filled with thorns until purification had been\r\nduly made. Duket's remains, which had been interred as those of a suicide,\r\nwere afterwards taken up and received the rights of Christian burial in\r\nBow Churchyard.\r\n\r\n(M195)\r\n\r\nThe year 1285 was a memorable one both for London and the kingdom. It\r\nwitnessed the passing of two important statutes. In the first place the\r\nstatute _De Donis_ legalised the principle of tying up real estate, so as\r\nto descend, in an exclusive perpetual line; in other words, it sanctioned\r\nentails, and its effect is still experienced at the present day in every\r\nordinary settlement of land. In the next place the Assise of Arms of Henry\r\nII was improved so as to secure for the king a national support in the\r\ntime of danger. In every hundred and franchise each man's armour was to be\r\nviewed twice a year; and defaults reported to the king \"who would find a\r\nremedy.\" The gates of walled towns were to be closed from sun-set to\r\nsun-rise, and watch and ward were to be kept as strictly as in times past,\r\n\"that is to wit, from the day of the Ascension until the day of S.\r\nMichael, in every city by six men at every gate; in every borough, twelve\r\nmen; every town, six or four, according to the number of the inhabitants\r\nof the town, and they shall watch the town continually all night from the\r\nsun-setting unto the sun-rising.\"(310) Three years previous to the passing\r\nof this statute the mayor, alderman and chamberlain had made very similar\r\nprovisions for the keeping of the City of London, the city's gates, and\r\nthe river Thames.(311)\r\n\r\n(M196)\r\n\r\nFor the city, the year was a memorable one, owing to the suspension of its\r\nfranchise. The circumstances which caused the loss of its liberties for a\r\nperiod of thirteen years (1285-1298) were these. The king's justiciars\r\nwere sitting at the Tower, where the mayor, sheriffs, and aldermen of the\r\ncity had been summoned to attend. Owing to some informality in the\r\nsummons, Gregory de Rokesley, the Mayor, declined to attend in his\r\nofficial capacity, but formally \"deposed himself\" at the Church of All\r\nHallows Barking--the limit of the city jurisdiction-- by handing the city's\r\nseal to Stephen Aswy or Eswy, a brother alderman. On entering the chamber\r\nwhere sat the justiciars, the mayor excused his unofficial appearance on\r\nthe ground of insufficient notice. This was not what the justiciars had\r\nbeen accustomed to. On the contrary, the citizens had usually shown\r\nstudied respect towards the justiciars whenever they came to the Tower for\r\nthe purpose of holding pleas of the crown.\r\n\r\n(M197)\r\n\r\nThe rules of procedure on such occasions are fully set out in the city's\r\n\"Liber Albus,\"(312) and they contain, curiously enough, a provision\r\nexpressly made for cases where the full notice of forty days had not been\r\ngiven. In such an event the prescribed rule was to send some of their more\r\ndiscreet citizens to the king and his council to ask for the appointment\r\nof another day. Whether Rokesley had taken this step before resorting to\r\nthe measures he did we are not told. It was also the custom on such\r\noccasions for the citizens to gather at Barking Church, clothed in their\r\nbest apparel, and thence proceed in a body to the Tower. A deputation was\r\nappointed--selected members of the common council--who should also proceed\r\nto the Tower for the purpose of giving an official welcome to the\r\njusticiars on behalf of the citizens. It was not thought to be in any way\r\nderogatory to secure the goodwill of the king's justiciars by making ample\r\npresents. It had been done time out of mind. The sheriffs and aldermen\r\nwere to attend with their respective sergeants and beadles, the benches at\r\nthe Tower were to be examined beforehand and necessary repairs carried\r\nout, all shops were to be closed and no business transacted during the\r\nsession. In a word, everything was to be done that could add to the\r\ndignity of the justiciars and the solemnity of the occasion. In contrast\r\nwith all this, Rokesley's conduct was indeed strange, and leads us to\r\nsuppose that his action was caused by some other and stronger reason than\r\nthe mere omission to give the usual notice of the coming of the king's\r\njusticiars.\r\n\r\n(M198)\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, the king's treasurer, who may possibly have been\r\nforewarned of what was about to take place, at once decided what course to\r\ntake. He declared the city to be there and then taken into the king's\r\nhands, on the pretext that it was found to be without a mayor, and he\r\nsummoned the citizens to appear on the morrow before the king at\r\nWestminster. When the morrow came, the citizens duly appeared, and about\r\neighty of them were detained. Those who accompanied Rokesley to Barking\r\nChurch on the previous day were confined in the Tower, but after a few\r\ndays they were all set at liberty, with the exception of Stephen Aswy, who\r\nwas removed in custody to Windsor.(313)\r\n\r\n(M199)\r\n\r\nThe king appointed Ralph de Sandwich _custos_ or warden of the city,\r\nenjoining him at the same time to observe the liberties and customs of the\r\ncitizens, and for the next thirteen years (1285-1298) the city continued\r\nto be governed by a warden in the person of Sandwich or of John le Breton,\r\nwhilst the sheriffs were sometimes appointed by the Exchequer and\r\nsometimes chosen by the citizens.(314)\r\n\r\n(M200)\r\n\r\nIn May, 1286, the king went to Gascony, leaving the country in charge of\r\nhis nephew, Edmund, Earl of Cornwall, and did not return until August,\r\n1289. He was then in sore straits for money, as was so often the case with\r\nhim, and was glad of a present of L1,000 which the citizens offered by way\r\nof courtesy (_curialitas_). The money was ordered (14th October) to be\r\nlevied by poll,(315) but many of the inhabitants were so poor that they\r\ncould only find pledges for future payment, and these pledges were\r\nafterwards sold for what they would fetch.(316) A twelve-month later\r\n(October, 1290) when Edward visited London, he was fain to be content with\r\nthe smaller sum of 1,000 marks.(317)\r\n\r\n(M201)\r\n\r\nThe expulsion of the Jews in 1290 increased Edward's difficulties, for on\r\nthem he chiefly depended for replenishing his empty exchequer. Their\r\nexpulsion was not so much his own wish as the wish of his subjects, who,\r\nbeing largely in debt to the Jews, regarded them as cruel tyrants. The\r\nnation soon discovered that it had made a mistake in thus getting rid of\r\nits creditors, for in the absence of the Jews, Edward was compelled to\r\nresort to the Lombard merchants. It may possibly have been owing to some\r\nmonetary transactions between them that the king was solicitous of getting\r\na life interest in the city's Small Beam made over to a lady known as\r\nJacobina la Lumbard. No particulars are known of this lady, but to judge\r\nfrom her name she probably came of a family of money-lenders, and if so,\r\nthe king's action in writing from Berwick (28th June, 1291) to the warden\r\nand aldermen of the city--at a time when he was completely in the hands of\r\nthe Italian goldsmiths and money-lenders--soliciting for her a more or less\r\nlucrative post is easily intelligible.(318) The king's request was\r\nrefused, notwithstanding the city being at the time in charge of a\r\n_custos_ of his own choice instead of a mayor elected by the citizens\r\nthemselves. Such requests produced friction between the king and the city,\r\nand the former's financial relations with the foreign merchants were\r\nfraught with danger to himself and to his son.(319)\r\n\r\n(M202)\r\n\r\nEdward's anxiety was in the meanwhile increased by domestic troubles. In\r\n1290 he suffered a bitter disappointment by the death of a Scottish\r\nprincess who was affianced to his son, the Prince of Wales, and thus a\r\nmuch-cherished plan for establishing friendly relations between the two\r\ncountries was frustrated.  But this disappointment was quickly cast in the\r\nshade by the more severe affliction he suffered in the loss of his wife.\r\nIn November Queen Eleanor died. Her corpse was brought from Lincoln to\r\nWestminster, and the bereaved husband ordered a memorial cross to be set\r\nup at each place where her body rested. One of these crosses was erected\r\nat the west end of Cheapside. After the Reformation the images with which\r\nthe cross was ornamented, like the image of Becket set over the gate of\r\nthe Mercers' Chapel, roused the anger of the iconoclast, who took delight\r\nin defacing them.\r\n\r\n(M203)\r\n\r\nTime only increased the king's pecuniary difficulties. In February, 1292,\r\nall freeholders of land of the annual value of L40 were ordered to receive\r\nknighthood, and in the following January the estates of defaulters were\r\nseized by the king's orders.(320) In June, 1294, war was declared against\r\nFrance. Money must be had. Every monastery and every church throughout\r\nEngland was ransacked for treasure, and the sum of L2,000, found in St.\r\nPaul's Church, was appropriated for the public service.(321) The dean was\r\nseized with a fit (_subita percussus passione_) and died in the king's\r\npresence.(322)\r\n\r\n(M204)\r\n\r\nInstead of invading France, Edward found his own shores devastated by a\r\nFrench fleet, whilst at the same time his hands were full with fresh\r\ndifficulties from Scotland and Wales. In the summer of 1295, the city\r\nfurnished the king with three ships, the cost being defrayed by a tax of\r\ntwopence in the pound charged on chattels and merchandise. John le Breton,\r\nthen warden, advanced the sum of L40, which the aldermen and six men of\r\neach ward undertook to repay.(323) In the following year (1296) the city\r\nagreed, after some little hesitation, to furnish forty men with\r\ncaparisoned horses, and fifty arbalesters for the defence of the south\r\ncoast, under the king's son, Edward of Carnarvon.(324)\r\n\r\n(M205)\r\n\r\nEdward again turned his attention to Scotland, and, having succeeded in\r\nreducing Balliol to submission, he carried off from Scone the stone which\r\nlegend identifies with Jacob's pillow, and on which the Scottish kings had\r\nfrom time immemorial been crowned,(325) By Edward's order the stone was\r\nenclosed in a stately seat, and placed in Westminster Abbey, where it has\r\nsince served as the coronation chair of English sovereigns.\r\n\r\n(M206)\r\n\r\nFrom Berwick Edward issued (26 Aug., 1296,) writs for a Parliament to meet\r\nat Bury St. Edmund's, in the following November. The constitution of this\r\nParliament was the same as that which had met at Westminster in November\r\nof the previous year (1295) and which was intended to serve as a model\r\nparliament, a pattern for all future national assemblies. The city was\r\nrepresented by two aldermen, namely, Sir Stephen Aswy, or Eswy, who had\r\nbeen confined in Windsor Castle ten years before for his conduct towards\r\nthe king's justiciars at the Tower, and Sir William de Hereford.(326) From\r\nthis time forward down to the present day we have little difficulty in\r\ndiscovering from one source or another the names of the city's\r\nrepresentatives in successive parliaments. Edward, of course, wanted\r\nmoney. The barons and knights increased their former grants; so also did\r\nthe burgesses. The clergy, on the other hand, declared themselves unable\r\nto make any grant at all in the face of a papal prohibition,(327) and the\r\nking was at last driven to seize the lay fees of the clergy of the\r\nprovince of Canterbury. In the spring of the following year he proceeded\r\nto seize all the wool of the country, paying for it by tallies, and to\r\nlevy a supply of provisions on the counties. The act was only justifiable\r\non the plea of necessity, and led to measures being taken to prevent its\r\nrepetition.(328)\r\n\r\n(M207)\r\n\r\nIt was an easier matter for Edward to raise money than to get the barons\r\nto accompany him abroad. To leave them behind was to risk the peace of the\r\ncountry. He therefore spared no efforts to persuade them to join in a\r\nprojected expedition, and when persuasion failed tried threats. It was his\r\ndesire that the barons should go to Gascony, whilst he took the command in\r\nFlanders. This was not at all to the taste of the barons, who declined to\r\ngo abroad, except in the personal retinue of the king himself. \"With you,\r\nO king,\" said Roger Bigod, \"I will gladly go; as belongs to me by\r\nhereditary right, I will go in front of the host, before your face;\" but\r\nwithout the king he positively declined to move. \"By God, earl,\" cried the\r\nking, fairly roused by the obstinacy of his vassal, \"you shall either go\r\nor hang;\" to which the earl replied, with equal determination, \"By the\r\nsame token, O king, I will neither go nor hang.\"(329)\r\n\r\nNothing daunted, the king issued writs (15 May) for a military levy of the\r\nwhole kingdom for service abroad, to meet at London on the 7th July, a\r\nmeasure as unconstitutional as the seizure of wool and the levying of\r\ntaxes without the assent of Parliament. On the day appointed, the barons,\r\nwho had received a large accession of strength from the great vassals,\r\nappeared with their forces at St. Paul's; but instead of complying with\r\nthe king's demands--or rather requests, for the king had altered his\r\ntone--they prepared a list of their grievances.\r\n\r\n(M208)\r\n\r\nWith difficulty civil war was avoided, and in August Edward set sail for\r\nFlanders. No sooner was his back turned, than the barons and the Londoners\r\nmade common cause in insisting upon a confirmation and amplification of\r\ntheir charters.(330) Prince Edward, the king's son, who had been appointed\r\nregent in his father's absence, granted all that was asked, and on the\r\n10th October (1297), the _Confirmatio Cartarum_, as it was called, was\r\nissued in the king's name.(331) Thenceforth, no customs duties were to be\r\nexacted without the consent of parliament.\r\n\r\n(M209)\r\n\r\nIn view of the king's return to England in March (1298), the warden of the\r\ncity, Sir John Breton, the aldermen, and a deputation from the wards met\r\ntogether and resolved that every inhabitant of the city, citizen and\r\nstranger, should pay to the king's collectors the sum of sixpence in the\r\npound of all their goods up to L100.(332) In the following month Edward\r\nissued letters patent (11th April), restoring to the citizens their\r\nfranchises and the right of again electing their mayor.(333) The choice of\r\nthe citizens fell upon Henry le Waleys, who was duly admitted by the\r\nBarons of the Exchequer after presentation to the king.(334)\r\n\r\n(M210)\r\n\r\nIn the summer Edward marched to Scotland for the purpose of putting down\r\nthe rising under Wallace. An account of the battle of Falkirk, fought on\r\nthe 22nd July, was conveyed to the mayor, aldermen, and \"barons\" of\r\nLondon, by letter from Walter Langton, Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry,\r\nor, as he was then styled, Bishop of Chester, who wrote as an eye-witness,\r\nif not indeed as a partaker in that day's work.(335) It was the first\r\nbattle of any consequence in which the English long-bow was brought into\r\nprominence. Edward's victory was complete. The enemy's loss was great, the\r\nnumber that perished, according to the bishop's information, being two\r\nhundred men-at-arms and twenty thousand foot soldiers. Edward was unable,\r\nhowever, to follow up his success for want of supplies, and so retreated.\r\nIn 1304, he again marched northward, notwithstanding the defection of many\r\nnobles. He had previously resorted once more to the questionable practice\r\nof talliaging the city of London,(336) levying from the citizens the\r\nfifteenth penny of their moveable goods and the tenth penny of their\r\nrents.(337) The campaign was eminently successful. Sterling surrendered\r\nafter a siege of two months, and Wallace himself shortly afterwards fell\r\ninto his hands, having refused the terms of an amnesty which Edward had\r\ngenerously offered.\r\n\r\n(M211)\r\n\r\nHe was carried to London, where a crowd of men and women flocked out to\r\nmeet one, of whose gigantic stature and feats of strength they had heard\r\nso much. He was lodged in the house of William de Leyre, an alderman of\r\nthe city, situate in the parish of All Hallows at the Hay or All Hallows\r\nthe Great. Having been tried at Westminster and condemned to death on\r\ncharges of treason, sacrilege and robbery, he was hanged, drawn, and\r\nquartered, and his head set up on London Bridge.(338)\r\n\r\n(M212)\r\n\r\nNo sooner was Wallace disposed of than another claimant to the Scottish\r\ncrown appeared in the person of Bruce. Before Edward took the field\r\nagainst the new foe, he conferred knighthood upon his son and nearly three\r\nhundred others, including John le Blound the mayor. The number of knights\r\nwithin the small compass of the city was reckoned at that time to be not\r\nless than a thousand.(339) Knighthood, as we have seen, was one of the\r\nmeans Edward resorted to for raising money, and on this occasion the\r\ncitizens of London are said to have made him a free gift of L2,000, in\r\nrecognition of the honour bestowed on their mayor.(340)\r\n\r\n(M213)\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1307, Edward set out to execute the vow of vengeance\r\nagainst Bruce that he had made on the occasion of the knighthood of his\r\nson, but the hand of death was upon him, and before lie reached the\r\nScottish border he died (7th July).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(M214)\r\n\r\nThe new king's character, differing as it did so much from that of his\r\nfather, was not one to commend itself to the citizens of London. With them\r\nhe never became a favourite. The bold and determined character of Queen\r\nIsabel, the very antipodes of her husband, was more to their liking, and\r\nthroughout the contests that ensued between them, the citizens steadily\r\nsupported her cause. At her first appearance, as a bride, in the city, the\r\nstreets were compared with the New Jerusalem, so rich were they in\r\nappearance;(341) whilst at the coronation ceremony, which took place a\r\nmonth later (25th February, 1308), she and her husband were escorted by\r\nthe mayor and aldermen in their most gorgeous robes, quartered with the\r\narms of England and France, and were served at the banquet as custom\r\ncommanded.(342)\r\n\r\n(M215)\r\n\r\nBut even thus early in Edward of Carnarvon's reign the presence of\r\nforeigners--to whom the king was even more addicted than his father--was\r\nlikely to prove a source of trouble; and it was necessary to make special\r\nproclamations forbidding the carrying of arms on the day of the coronation\r\nand enjoining respect for foreigners attending the ceremony.(343) The\r\nking's foreign favourites proved his ruin, and contributed in no small\r\ndegree to the eventual defection of the city. They were for ever desiring\r\nsome favour of the citizens. At one time it was Piers de Gavestone who\r\nwanted a post for his \"valet\";(344) at another it was Hugh le Despenser\r\nwho desired (and obtained) a lease of the Small Beam for a friend.(345)\r\nThe friend only held the Beam for little more than six months, and then,\r\nat the urgent request of the queen herself, it was given to another.(346)\r\n\r\n(M216)\r\n\r\nThe barons were especially irritated at being supplanted by the king's\r\nfavourites, and in 1308 succeeded in getting Edward to send Gaveston out\r\nof England. In the following year, however, he was recalled, and the\r\nbarons became so exasperated that in 1310, when the king summoned an\r\nassembly of bishops and barons, the latter appeared, contrary to orders,\r\nin full military array. The king could not do otherwise than submit to\r\ntheir dictation. Ordainers were appointed from among the barons for the\r\npurpose of drawing up ordinances for the government of the kingdom. These\r\nordinances were promulgated in their complete form in 1311, when they\r\nreceived the sanction of a parliament assembled at the House of the Black\r\nFriars, in the month of August, and were afterwards publicly proclaimed in\r\nSt. Paul's Churchyard,(347) special precautions being taken at the time to\r\nsafeguard the gates of the city by night and day.(348) Gaveston was\r\ncondemned to banishment for life.\r\n\r\n(M217)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, whilst the Ordainers were engaged on their work, Edward\r\nhad put himself at the head of his army and marched against the Scots, who\r\nwere rapidly gaining ground under Bruce. He remained on the border until\r\nJuly, 1311, trying every means to raise money. In March of that year the\r\ncity sent him one thousand marks, by the hands of Roger le Palmere and\r\nWilliam de Flete, the mayor, Richer de Refham, contributing no less than\r\none hundred pounds of the whole sum. The money was despatched on\r\nhorseback, tied up in baskets covered with matting and bound with cords,\r\nand the cost of every particular is set out in the city's records.(349)\r\n\r\n(M218)\r\n\r\nRefham was a mayor of the popular type. He had already suffered\r\ndeprivation of his aldermanry for some reason or another, but was\r\nreinstated in 13O2.(350) No sooner was he chosen mayor than he caused a\r\ncollection to be made of the ancient liberties and customs of the city,\r\nfrom the books and rolls preserved in the city's Chamber, and having\r\nassembled the aldermen and best men of the city, he caused them to be\r\npublicly read. This having been done, he next proceeded to ask the\r\nassembly if it was their will that these ancient customs and liberties,\r\nwhich had so often been infringed by the removal of mayors and sheriffs,\r\nshould be for the future maintained. Their answer being given unanimously\r\nin the affirmative, he at once took steps to obtain the king's writ of\r\nconfirmation, and caused them to be proclaimed throughout the city. He\r\nmade a perambulation of the city and abated all nuisances and\r\nencroachments. He went further than this. For some time past the streets\r\nhad been rendered unsafe to pass after dark by bands of rioters who at\r\nthat day were known by the _sobriquet_ of \"roreres.\" A few years later,\r\nthe same class went under the name of \"riffleres.\" They were the\r\nprecursors of the \"Muns,\" the \"Tityre Tus,\" the \"Hectors,\" and the\r\n\"Scourers,\"--dynasties of tyrants, as Macaulay styles them, which\r\ndomineered over the streets of London, soon after the Restoration, and at\r\na later period were superseded by the \"Nickers,\" the \"Hawcubites,\" and the\r\nstill more dreaded \"Mohawks,\" of Queen Anne's reign. By whatever name they\r\nhappened at the time to be known, their practice was the same,\r\nviz.:--assault and robbery of peaceful citizens whose business or pleasure\r\ncarried them abroad after sundown.\r\n\r\nDuring Refham's mayoralty, a raid was made on all common nightwalkers,\r\n\"bruisers\" (_pugnatores_), common \"roreres,\" _wagabunds_ and others, and\r\nmany were committed to prison, to the great relief of the more peaceably\r\ndisposed.(351)\r\n\r\nHis strictness and impartiality were such as to raise up enemies, and an\r\nexcuse was found for removing him not only from the office of mayor, but\r\nonce again from his aldermanry.(352) On this point, however, the city\r\narchives are altogether silent, they only record the appointment of his\r\nsuccessor to the mayoralty chair at the usual time and in the usual\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n(M219)\r\n\r\nIn January, 1312, the king returned to the north, and as soon as he had\r\narrived at York ignored the ordinance touching Gaveston, and instead of\r\nsending his favourite into exile, received him into favour and restored\r\nhis forfeited estates. Foreseeing the storm that he would have to meet\r\nfrom the barons, the king wrote from Knaresborough (9th Jan.) to Refham's\r\nsuccessor, John de Gisors, enjoining him to put the city into a state of\r\ndefence, and not allow armed men to enter on any pretext whatever.(353) On\r\nthe 21st he wrote again, not only to the mayor, but to nineteen leading\r\nmen of the city, exhorting them to hold the city for him.(354) Other\r\nletters followed in quick succession--on the 24th and 31st January and the\r\n8th February--all couched in similar terms.(355) When, however, he saw how\r\nhopeless his case was, Edward sent word to the mayor and sheriffs that the\r\nbarons might be admitted provided the city was still held for the king.\r\nAccordingly the barons were admitted without bloodshed, and held\r\nconsultation at St. Paul's as to what was best to be done.(356) Gaveston's\r\ndays were numbered. On the 12th June he was forced to surrender\r\nunconditionally to the Earl of Warwick, and that day week was beheaded\r\nwithout the semblance of a trial.(357)\r\n\r\nThe influence he had exercised over the king had been remarkable from\r\ntheir youth. The son of a Gascon knight, he had been brought up with\r\nEdward as his foster brother and playfellow, and in course of time the\r\nstrong will of the favourite gained a complete mastery over the weaker\r\nwill of the prince. But his arrogant behaviour soon raised such a storm\r\namong the nobles at Court that he was forced to leave England. When Edward\r\nsucceeded to the throne, one of his first acts was to recall Gaveston, to\r\nwhom he gave his own niece in marriage, after having bestowed upon him the\r\nEarldom of Cornwall. The king seemed never tired of heaping wealth upon\r\nhis friend. Among other things, he bestowed upon his favourite (28th Aug.,\r\n1309) the sum of 100 shillings payable out of the rent of L50 due from the\r\ncitizens of London for Oueenhithe, to be held by him, his wife, and the\r\nheirs of their bodies.(358)\r\n\r\nBoth of them had friends and enemies in common. As Prince of Wales, Edward\r\nhad made an attempt to encroach upon some woods belonging to Walter\r\nLangton, Bishop of Chester. This caused a breach between father and son,\r\nand the prince was banished from Court for a whole half-year. Gaveston\r\nalso bore the same bishop a grudge, for it was owing in a great measure to\r\nLangton's influence as treasurer to Edward I that he was in the first\r\ninstance forced into exile. When the prince succeeded his father, there\r\ncame a day of retribution for the bishop; his property was handed over to\r\nGaveston, and he himself carried prisoner from castle to castle by the now\r\nall powerful favourite. A proclamation was also issued at the instance of\r\nGaveston, inviting complaints against the bishop.(359)\r\n\r\n(M220)\r\n\r\nEdward had purposed holding a parliament at Lincoln towards the end of\r\nJuly, 1312, but the turn that affairs had taken induced him to change his\r\nmind, and he summoned it to meet at Westminster.(360) It was important\r\nthat he should secure the city, if possible, in his favour. In this he was\r\nsuccessful; so that when the barons appeared to threaten London, having\r\narrived with a large force at Ware, they found the city's gates strongly\r\nguarded.(361)\r\n\r\n(M221)\r\n\r\nIn November (1312), the queen gave birth to a son, who afterwards ascended\r\nthe throne as Edward III. Isabel herself informed the citizens of the\r\nauspicious event by letter sent by the hands of John de Falaise, her\r\n\"taillur.\"(362) The news had already reached the city, however, before the\r\nqueen's own messenger arrived, and he signified his disappointment at\r\nbeing forestalled by declining to accept a sum of L10 and a silver cup of\r\n32 ozs., which the city offered him by way of gratuity, as being\r\ninadequate to his deserts. As nothing further is recorded of the matter,\r\nit is probable that the offended tailor had reason to repent of his folly.\r\nFor more than a week the city was given up to merry-making, in honour of\r\nthe birth of an heir to the crown. The conduits ran with wine; a solemn\r\nmass was sung at St. Paul's, and the mayor and aldermen rode in state to\r\nWestminster, accompanied by members of the fraternities of drapers,\r\nmercers, and vintners of London, in their respective liveries, to make\r\noffering, returning to dine at the Guildhall, which was hung with tapestry\r\nas befitted the occasion.\r\n\r\n(M222)\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Gaveston, his old enemy Walter Langton again found\r\nfavour and resumed his office as treasurer. The city had little reason to\r\nbe gratified at his return to power; for it was by his advice that the\r\nking in December of this year (1312), issued orders for a talliage, which\r\nthe great towns, and especially London, objected to pay. Early in the\r\nfollowing January (1313), the mayor and aldermen were summoned to attend\r\nthe royal council, sitting at the house of the White Friars. The question\r\nwas there put to them--would they make fine for the talliage, or be\r\nassessed by poll on their rents and chattels? Before making answer, the\r\nmayor and aldermen desired to consult the commons of the city. An\r\nadjournment accordingly took place for that purpose. When next the mayor\r\nand aldermen appeared before the council, they resisted the talliage on\r\nthe following grounds:(363)--In the first place, because, although the king\r\nmight talliage cities and boroughs that were of his demesne, he could not,\r\nas they understood, talliage the City of London, which enjoyed exemption\r\nfrom such an imposition by charter. In the next place, there were prelates\r\nand barons, besides citizens, who enjoyed rents and tenements in the city,\r\nand their consent would first have to be obtained before the municipal\r\nauthorities could levy such a tax. Thirdly, the citizens held the city by\r\ngrant of former kings, at a fee ferm for all services payable into the\r\nexchequer, and on that account ought not to be talliaged. Under these\r\ncircumstances the council was asked to delay the talliage until Parliament\r\nshould meet.\r\n\r\nThis request the king and council expressed themselves as ready to comply\r\nwith on condition that the city made an immediate advance of 2,000 marks.\r\nThe city refused, and the king's assessors appeared at the Guildhall, and\r\nread their commission. They were on the point of commencing work, when the\r\ncity obtained a respite until the meeting of Parliament by a loan of\r\nL1,000. More than eighteen months elapsed, and at last a Parliament was\r\nsummoned to meet at York (Sept. 1314); but the country was in such a\r\ndisturbed state, owing to the renewal of the war with Scotland, that the\r\ntalliage question was not discussed. Nevertheless the king's officers\r\nappeared again in the city to make an assessment, and again they were\r\nbought off by another loan of L400. The king took the money and broke his\r\nword, and the record of pledges taken from citizens for \"arrears of divers\r\ntalliages and not redeemed,\" is significant of the hardship inflicted by\r\nthis illegal exaction on a large number of inhabitants of the city.(364)\r\n\r\n(M223)\r\n\r\nOut of this sum of L400, nearly one-half (L178 3_s._ 4_d._), was allowed\r\nthe city for the purpose of furnishing the king with a contingent of 120\r\narbalesters, fully equipped for the defence of Berwick. Edward had been\r\ndefeated by the Scots at Bannockburn (24 June, 1314), and Berwick was\r\nthreatened. On the 21st November, Edward wrote from Northampton, asking\r\nfor 300 arbalesters if the city could provide so many; but the city could\r\ndo no more than furnish him with 120.(365) The fall of Berwick was only\r\npostponed. In 1318 the great border fortress against Scotland was captured\r\nby Bruce. Edward was forced soon afterwards to come to terms with the Earl\r\nof Lancaster and the barons with whom he had so long been in avowed\r\nantagonism, and a general pacification ensued, which received the sanction\r\nof Parliament sitting at York in November.(366) On the 4th December, the\r\nking sent home the foot soldiers which the city had furnished, with a\r\nletter of thanks for the aid they had afforded him. They were immediately\r\npaid off and disbanded.(367)\r\n\r\n(M224)\r\n\r\nIt was not long before the king and Lancaster were preparing to join\r\nforces for the recovery of Berwick. In the meantime, the Barons of the\r\nExchequer appeared at the Guildhall (25th February, 1319), and summoned\r\nthe mayor, sheriffs and aldermen to answer for certain trespasses. Several\r\nholders of office, and among them Edmund le Lorimer, Gaoler of Newgate,\r\nfor whom Hugh le Despenser had solicited the Small Beam, were deposed: a\r\nproceeding which gave rise to much bickering between mayor, aldermen and\r\ncommons. Disputes, moreover, had arisen in the city touching the election\r\nand removal of the mayor, sheriffs and aldermen of the city, which\r\nrequired some pressure from the Earl Marshal and other of the king's\r\nministers, sitting in the Chapter-house of St. Paul's, before peace could\r\nbe restored.(368)\r\n\r\n(M225)\r\n\r\nAccording to the writer of the French Chronicle, to which reference has\r\nfrequently been made,(369) the dissension in the city was mainly\r\nattributable to John de Wengrave, the mayor. The citizens had lately been\r\nbusy drawing up certain \"points\" for a new charter. Wengrave, who was at\r\nthe time, or until quite recently, the city's Recorder, had contrived, in\r\n1318, to force himself into the mayoralty having served as mayor the two\r\nyears preceding--\"against the will of the commons.\" He had shown no little\r\nopposition to the \"points\" of the proposed charter, possibly because one\r\nof the points precluded the mayor, for the time being, from drawing or\r\nhearing pleas, saving only \"those pleas which, as mayor, he ought to hear,\r\naccording to the custom of the city.\"(370) If this received the king's\r\napproval, Wengrave's occupation as Recorder, at least so long as he was\r\nmayor, was gone. However this may be, the mayor's opposition was rendered\r\nfutile, and the articles were confirmed by the king's letters patent.(371)\r\nTheir main feature has already been alluded to; thenceforth the direct way\r\nto the civic franchise was to be through membership of one of the civic\r\nguilds. A foreigner or stranger, not a member of a guild, could only\r\nobtain it by appealing to the full body of citizens before admission\r\nthrough the Court of Husting. Conscious of their newly acquired\r\nimportance, the guilds began to array themselves in liveries, and \"a good\r\ntime was about to begin.\"(372) Edward did not give his assent to these\r\narticles without receiving a _quid pro quo_. The citizens were mulcted in\r\na sum of L1,000 before the king's seal was set to the letters patent.(373)\r\nThey did not mind this so much as they did the annoyance caused by the\r\nking's justiciars eighteen months later.\r\n\r\n(M226)\r\n\r\nEarly in 1321 commenced a memorable Iter at the Tower which lasted\r\ntwenty-four weeks and three days. No such Iter had been held before,\r\nalthough the last Iter held in 1275 had been a remarkable one for the\r\ncourageous conduct of Gregory de Rokesle, the mayor. This was to surpass\r\nevery other session of Pleas of the Crown in its powers of inquisition,\r\nand was destined to draw off many a would-be loyal citizen from the king's\r\nside. Its professed object was to examine into unlawful \"colligations,\r\nconfederations, and conventions by oaths,\" which were known (or supposed)\r\nto have been formed in the city.(374) The following particulars of its\r\nproceedings are gathered from an account preserved in the city's records\r\nand supervised, if not compiled, by Andrew Horn, the city's Chamberlain,\r\nan able lawyer who was employed as Counsel for the city during at least a\r\nportion of the Iter.(375) The annoyance caused by this Iter, the general\r\nstoppage of trade and commerce, the hindrance of municipal business, is\r\nrealised when we consider that for six months not only the mayor, sheriffs\r\nand aldermen for the time being, but everyone who had filled any office in\r\nthe city since the holding of the last Iter--a period of nearly half a\r\ncentury--as well as twelve representatives from each ward, were called upon\r\nto be in constant attendance. All charters were to be produced, and\r\npersons who had grievances of any kind were invited to appear. Great\r\ncommotion prevailed among the citizens upon receiving the king's writ, and\r\nthey at once addressed themselves to examining the procedure followed at\r\nformer Iters. It is probable, as Mr. Riley suggests, that for this purpose\r\nthey had resort to the \"Ordinances of the Iter\" already mentioned as set\r\nout in the city's Liber Albus.(376) When the dreaded day arrived and the\r\njusticiars had taken their seat at the Tower, the mayor and aldermen, who,\r\naccording to custom, as already seen in Rokesley's day, were assembled at\r\nthe church of All Hallows Barking, sent a deputation to welcome them, and\r\nto make a formal request for a safe conduct to the citizens on entering\r\nthe Tower. This favour being granted, the king's commission was read.\r\n\r\n(M227)\r\n\r\nThe opening of the Iter did not augur well for the city. Fault was found,\r\nat the outset, by Geoffrey le Scrop, the king's sergeant-pleader, because\r\nthe sheriffs had not attended so promptly as they should have done. The\r\nexcuse that they had only acted according to custom in waiting for the\r\ngrant of a safe conduct was held unsatisfactory, and nothing would please\r\nhim but that the city should be at once taken into the king's hand.(377)\r\n\r\n(M228)\r\n\r\nAgain, when the citizens claimed to record their liberties and customs by\r\nword of mouth without being compelled to reduce them into writing, as the\r\njustices had ordered, the only reply they got was that they did so at\r\ntheir own peril.(378) Three days were consumed in preliminary discussion\r\nof points of etiquette and questions of minor importance.\r\n\r\n(M229)\r\n\r\nOn the fourth day the mayor and citizens put in their claim of liberties,\r\nwhich they supported by various charters.(379) The justiciars desired\r\nanswers on three points, which were duly made,(380) and matters seemed to\r\nbe getting forward when there arrived orders from the king that the\r\njusticiars should enquire as to the ancient right of the aldermen to\r\nrecord their liberties orally in the king's courts. Having heard what the\r\ncitizens had to say on this point, the justiciars were instructed to\r\nwithhold their judgment; and this and other questions touching the\r\nliberties of the city were to be postponed for future determination.(381)\r\n\r\n(M230)\r\n\r\nOn the ninth day of the Iter, a long schedule, containing over 100\r\narticles upon which the Crown desired information, was delivered to each\r\nward of the city.(382) Days and weeks were consumed in considering various\r\npresentments, besides private suits and pleas of the Crown. Suits were\r\ndetermined in the Great Hall of the Tower facing the Thames, whilst pleas\r\nof the Crown were heard in the Lesser Hall, beneath the eastern tower. The\r\njusticiars occasionally protracted their sittings till dusk, much to the\r\ndisgust of the citizens, whose business was necessarily at a stand-still,\r\nand as yet no indictments had been made.(383) These were to come.\r\n\r\n(M231)\r\n\r\nOn the thirty-fourth day of the Iter, John de Gisors was indicted for\r\nhaving during his mayoralty (1311-1313), admitted a felon to the freedom\r\nof the city, and fraudulently altered the date of his admission. The\r\nquestion of criminality turned upon this date. Had the felony been\r\ncommitted before or after admission? The accused declared in his defence\r\nthat admission to the freedom had taken place before the felony; a jury,\r\nhowever, came to the opposite conclusion, and not only found that\r\nadmission had taken place after an indictment for the felony, but that the\r\nmayor at the time was aware of the indictment. The judges therefore\r\nordered Gisors into custody. He was soon afterwards released on bail, but\r\nnot without paying a fine of 100 marks.(384)\r\n\r\n(M232)\r\n\r\nA similar indictment against his son Anketin, as having participated in\r\nhis father's offence, failed. Within a week of Gisors's indictment, the\r\nmayor for the time being, Nicholas de Farndon, was deposed, and the city\r\nplaced in the hands of Sir Robert de Kendale, the king's\r\ncommissioner.(385)\r\n\r\n(M233)\r\n\r\nFor nine weeks in succession the citizens had suffered from the\r\ninconveniences of the Iter, when a brief adjournment over Easter took\r\nplace. In the meantime, an assay was held at the Guildhall of the new\r\nweights and measures which Walter Stapleton, Bishop of Exeter, had, in his\r\ncapacity as the king's treasurer, caused to be issued throughout the\r\ncountry. One result of the trial was that whilst the city's weight of\r\neight marks was discovered to be slightly deficient, the city's bushel was\r\nfound to be more true than the king's.\r\n\r\n(M234)\r\n\r\nAfter Easter the sittings of the justiciars were resumed. A great change,\r\nhowever, had come over them during the recess. They no longer behaved\r\n\"like lions eager for their prey; on the contrary, they had become very\r\nlambs.\"(386) The reason for this sudden change, we are told, was the\r\ninsurrection in Wales, under the Earl of Hereford, the king's\r\nbrother-in-law.\r\n\r\n(M235)\r\n\r\nThe chief questions discussed before the justices were the right of the\r\nweavers of London to hold their guild, and the right of the fishmongers of\r\nFish-wharf to sell their fish at their wharf by retail instead of on their\r\nvessels or at the city markets. The claim of the fishmongers was opposed\r\nby Andrew Horn, himself a fishmonger by trade, as well as an eminent\r\nlawyer, who acted on this occasion as leading counsel for the City.\r\n\r\n(M236)\r\n\r\nWhen Whitsuntide was approaching, an indictment was brought by the city\r\nwards against their old enemy John de Crombwelle, the Constable of the\r\nTower. He had already made himself obnoxious to the citizens by attempting\r\nto enclose a portion of the city's lands;(387) and now he was accused of\r\nseizing a small vessel laden with tiles, and converting the same to his\r\nown use, and further, with taking bribes for allowing unauthorised\r\n\"kidels\" to remain in the Thames. The judges, having heard what he had to\r\nsay in defence, postponed the further hearing until after Trinity Sunday\r\n(14th June). In the meantime, the citizens had the gratification of seeing\r\nthe constable removed from office, for allowing the Tower to fall into\r\nsuch a dilapidated state, that the rain came in upon the queen's bed,\r\nwhile giving birth to a daughter, afterwards known as Joanna of the\r\nTower,(388) and destined to become the wife of David the Second, King of\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\n(M237)\r\n\r\nOn the judges resuming their sittings after Trinity Sunday, they sat no\r\nlonger in the Great Hall or the Lesser Hall, \"as well by reason of the\r\nqueen being in childbed there, as already mentioned, as of the fortifying\r\nof the Tower, through fear of the Earl of Hereford and his accomplices,\r\nwho were in insurrection on every side.\" Temporary buildings had to be\r\nfound for them. A fortnight later there were signs of the Iter being\r\nbrought to an abrupt termination, the citizens having represented that\r\nthey could not possibly keep proper watch and ward owing to disturbances\r\nconsequent to the holding of the Iter;(389) and within a week, viz., on\r\n4th July, it was actually closed.\r\n\r\n(M238)\r\n\r\nIt was the bursting of the storm which had long been gathering against the\r\nking's new favourites, the Despensers, father and son, that caused the\r\nsudden termination of the Iter, and it was the fear lest he should lose\r\nthe support of the city against Lancaster and his allies that caused the\r\nking quickly to restore to the citizens their Mayor. Hamo de Chigwell took\r\nthe place of the deposed Farndon.(390)\r\n\r\n(M239)\r\n\r\nWithin a few hours of the closing of the Iter Chigwell and the aldermen\r\nwere summoned to Westminster to say whether they would be willing to\r\nsupport the king and to preserve the city of London to his use in his\r\ncontest with the barons. Edward and his council received for answer that\r\nthe mayor and his brethren \"were unwilling to refuse the safe keeping of\r\nthe city,\" but would keep it for the king and his heirs. They were\r\nthereupon enjoined to prepare a scheme for its defence for submission to\r\nthe king's council, and this was accordingly done.(391)\r\n\r\n(M240)\r\n\r\nThe city was, however, wavering in its support; Chigwell did his best to\r\nhold the balance between king and baron, and to hold a middle course,\r\navoiding offence as far as was possible to one side and the other. After\r\nthe lapse of a few days, a letter came from the Earl of Hereford,\r\naddressed to the mayor, sheriffs, aldermen and commonalty of the city,\r\nasking for an interview. It was then decided, after due deliberation in\r\nthe Court of Husting, to ask Edward's advice on the matter before\r\nreturning an answer. At first the king was disinclined to allow the\r\ninterview, but when the lords approached nearer London, and resistance\r\nwould have been hopeless, he gave way, and a deputation was appointed to\r\nmeet the lords at the Earl of Lancaster's house in Holborn. To them the\r\nearl explained the aim and object of himself and his confederates. They\r\nwere desirous of nothing so much as the good of the realm and the\r\noverthrow of the Despensers, father and son, who led the king astray and\r\nhad caused the Iter to be held at the Tower in order to injure the city.\r\nHaving listened to the earl's statement, the recorder, on behalf of the\r\ndeputation, asked for a few days' delay in order to consult with the mayor\r\nand commonalty. The matter was laid before an assembly which comprised\r\nrepresentatives from each ward (30th July), and again it was resolved to\r\nask the king's advice. At length a reply was sent to the lords to the\r\neffect that the citizens would neither aid the Despensers nor oppose the\r\nlords, but the city would in the meantime be strongly guarded for the\r\npreservation of order. With this the lords were satisfied.(392)\r\n\r\n(M241)\r\n\r\nA fortnight later (14th August) the king, moved by the intercession of the\r\nEarl of Pembroke, the bishops, and his queen, yielded to the lords, and an\r\nagreement between them was reduced to writing and publicly read in\r\nWestminster Hall.(393)\r\n\r\n(M242)\r\n\r\nChigwell's conduct throughout met with so much favour from the citizens as\r\nwell as from the king that when the latter issued letters patent(394)\r\ngranting a free election of a mayor in October of this year, it was\r\ndecided to continue Chigwell in office without a fresh election.(395)\r\n\r\n(M243)\r\n\r\nSuch popularity as the king had for a time achieved by his concession to\r\nthe demands of the lords, however unwillingly made, was enhanced by\r\nanother circumstance. An insult had been offered to the queen by Lady\r\nBadlesmere, who had refused to admit her into her castle at Ledes, co.\r\nKent, when on her way to Canterbury. The queen was naturally indignant,\r\nand the unexpected energy displayed by Edward in avenging the insult gave\r\nfresh strength to his cause. With the assistance of a contingent sent by\r\nthe citizens of London, the king beseiged the castle, and, having taken\r\nit, hanged the governor.(396) Sir Bartholomew de Badlesmere, the owner of\r\nthe castle, was afterwards taken and put to death at Canterbury.\r\n\r\n(M244)\r\n\r\nElated with his success, the king forthwith proceeded to issue \"a charter\r\nof service\"--_i.e._, a charter binding the citizens to serve him in future\r\nwars--which he wished the good people of London to have sealed, \"but the\r\npeople of the city would not accede to it for all that the king could\r\ndo.\"(397) In the place of this charter, however, he was induced to grant\r\nthe citizens one of a diametrically opposite nature, whereby it was\r\nprovided that the aids granted by the citizens upon this occasion should\r\nnot be prejudicial to the mayor and citizens, nor be looked upon as\r\nestablishing a precedent.(398)\r\n\r\n(M245)\r\n\r\nHaving thus secured an acknowledgment of their rights, the citizens were\r\nready enough to waive them when occasion required. The battle of\r\nBoroughbridge (16 March, 1322) was won for the king by the aid of\r\nLondoners. We know, at least, that when he started from London at the\r\nclose of 1321 he was accompanied by five hundred men at arms from the\r\ncity, and one hundred and twenty more were sent after him on the 3rd\r\nMarch.(399)\r\n\r\n(M246)\r\n\r\nThe Londoners were by no means to be despised in the field. Froissart\r\ndescribes them as being very dangerous when once their blood was up, and\r\nslaughter on the battle field only gave them fresh courage.(400) A late\r\nwriter(401) who was pleased to describe the city's military force as \"an\r\narmy of drapers' apprentices and journeymen tailors, with common\r\ncouncilmen for captains and aldermen for colonels,\" gave it credit,\r\nnevertheless, for natural courage, which, combined with befitting\r\nequipment and martial discipline, rendered the force a valuable ally and a\r\nformidable enemy.\r\n\r\n(M247)\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Lancaster, who was made prisoner at Boroughbridge, and\r\nafterwards executed before his own castle at Pomfret, had come to be a\r\ngreat favourite with the Londoners, in whose eyes he appeared as the\r\nchampion of the oppressed against the strong. His memory was long\r\ncherished in the city, and miracles were believed to have taken place--the\r\ncrooked made straight, the blind receiving sight and the deaf\r\nhearing--before the tablet he had set up in St. Paul's commemorative of the\r\nking's submission to the Ordinances. Edward ordered the removal of the\r\ntablet, but it was again set up as soon as all power had passed from his\r\nhands.(402)\r\n\r\n(M248)\r\n\r\nEdward, again a free ruler, lost no time in revoking these Ordinances. The\r\nelder Despenser he raised to the earldom of Winchester.(403) This was in\r\nMay, 1322; a year later (April, 1323), he deposed Chigwell, who had again\r\nbeen re-elected to the mayoralty in the previous October, and put in his\r\nplace Nicholas de Farndon,(404) thus reversing the order of things in\r\n1321, when Farndon had been deposed and his place taken by Chigwell.\r\n\r\nThe deposed mayor, however, was ordered to keep close attendance on the\r\nCourt, as were also three other London citizens, viz.: Hamo Godchep,\r\nEdmund Lambyn, and Roger le Palmere; and in the following November he\r\nrecovered his position,(405) and held it for the rest of Edward's reign.\r\n\r\n(M249)\r\n\r\nThe king's triumph was destined to be short-lived. In August, 1323, Roger\r\nMortimer, a favourite of the queen, effected his escape from the Tower,\r\nwhere he had lain prisoner since January, 1322. The divided feeling of the\r\ncitizens which had been more or less apparent since the year of the great\r\nIter, now began to assert itself. Mortimer's escape had taken place with\r\nthe connivance, if not active assistance, of a leading citizen, Richard de\r\nBetoyne, and he took sanctuary on the property of another leading citizen,\r\nJohn Gisors.(406) In November the citizens thought fit to close their\r\ngates, to prevent surprise.(407)\r\n\r\n(M250)\r\n\r\nIn the following year (1324), a quarrel broke out between two of the city\r\nguilds, the weavers and the goldsmiths. Fights took place in the streets\r\nand lives were lost.(408) How far, if at all, such a quarrel had any\r\npolitical significance it is difficult to say, but it is not unlikely, at\r\na time when the guilds were winning their way to chartered rights, that\r\noccasionally their members took sides in the political struggle that was\r\nthen being carried on.\r\n\r\n(M251)\r\n\r\nEdward, in the meanwhile, was threatened with war by France, unless he\r\nconsented to cross the sea and do homage to the French king for the\r\npossessions he held in that country. This the Despensers dared not allow\r\nhim to do. A compromise was therefore effected. Queen Isabel, who was not\r\nsorry for an opportunity of quitting the side of a husband who had seized\r\nall her property, removed her household, and put her on board wages at\r\ntwenty shillings a day,(409) undertook, with the king's assent, to revisit\r\nher home and to bring about a settlement. Accordingly, on the 9th\r\nMarch,(410) 1324, she crossed over to France, where she was afterwards\r\njoined by Mortimer and her son.\r\n\r\n(M252)\r\n\r\nOnce on the continent, the queen threw off the mask, and immediately began\r\nto concert measures against the king and the Despensers. By negotiating a\r\nmarriage for her son with the daughter of the Count of Hainault, she\r\ncontrived to raise supporters in England, whilst by her affected humility\r\nand sorrow, displayed by wearing simple apparel as one that mourned for\r\nher husband, she won the sympathy of all who beheld her.(411) The king, on\r\nthe other hand, publicly forbade any one holding correspondence with her,\r\ncaused provisions to be laid up in the Tower in case of emergency, and\r\nprepared a fleet to prevent her landing.\r\n\r\n(M253)\r\n\r\nIt was all in vain. The majority of the citizens had made up their mind to\r\ngive him no more support. On the 24th September, 1326, Isabel, in spite of\r\nall precautions, effected a landing near Harwich; and Edward, as soon as\r\nhe was made aware of her arrival in England, took fright and left London\r\nfor the west. The queen, who was accompanied by her son and her \"gentle\r\nMortimer,\" gave out that she came as an avenger of Earl Thomas, whose\r\nmemory was yet green in the minds of the citizens, and as the enemy of the\r\nDespensers.(412) Adherents quickly came in from all sides, and with these\r\nshe leisurely (_quasi peregrinando_) followed up the king.(413)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime a letter had been despatched to the city in her name and\r\nthat of her son, desiring its assistance in destroying \"the enemies of the\r\nland.\" To this letter, we are told, no answer was sent \"through fear of\r\nthe king.\" Another letter was therefore sent to the same effect, in which\r\nHugh Despenser was especially named as one to be destroyed, and an\r\nimmediate answer was requested.(414) This letter was affixed to the cross\r\nin Cheapside and copies circulated through the city.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th October, the city broke out into open rebellion. The mayor and\r\nother leading men had gone to the house of the Blackfriars to meet the\r\nBishops of London and Exeter. The mob, now fairly roused by the queen's\r\nsecond letter, hurried thither and forced them to return to the Guildhall,\r\nthe timid Chigwell \"crying mercy with clasped hands,\" and promising to\r\ngrant all they required. A proclamation was made shortly afterwards to the\r\neffect that \"the enemies to the king and the queen and their son\" should\r\ndepart the city.(415)\r\n\r\n(M254)\r\n\r\nOne unfortunate man, John le Marchall, suspected of being employed by Hugh\r\nDespenser as a spy, was seized and incontinently beheaded in Cheapside.\r\nThe mob, having tasted blood, hastened to sack the house of Walter\r\nStapleton, Bishop of Exeter, who as Edward's treasurer, had confiscated\r\nthe queen's property. It so happened, that the bishop himself, attended by\r\ntwo esquires, was riding towards the city intending to have his midday\r\nmeal at his house in Old Dean's Lane (now Warwick Lane), before proceeding\r\nto the Tower. Hearing cries of \"Traitor!\" he guessed that something was\r\nwrong, and made for sanctuary in St. Paul's. He was caught, however, just\r\nas he was about to enter the north door, dragged from his horse, carried\r\nto Chepe, and there put to death in the same way as John le Marchall had\r\nbeen executed a short hour before.(416)\r\n\r\nThe bishop's two attendant esquires also perished at the hands of the mob.\r\nTheir bodies were allowed to lie stark naked all that day in the middle of\r\nChepe. The head of the bishop was sent to the queen at Gloucester,(417)\r\nbut his corpse was reverently carried into St. Paul's after vespers by the\r\ncanons and vicars of the cathedral. It was not allowed, however, to remain\r\nthere long; for hearing that the bishop had died under sentence of\r\nexcommunication, the authorities caused it to be removed to the church of\r\nSt. Clement Danes, near which stood the bishop's new manor house of which\r\nwe are reminded at the present day by Exeter Hall. The parish church was\r\nin the gift of the Bishop of Exeter for the time being, and John Mugg,\r\nthen rector, owed his preferment to Stapleton. He was, therefore, guilty\r\nof gross ingratitude when he refused to take in the corpse of his patron,\r\nor to allow it the rites of burial. Certain poor women had more\r\ncompassion; they at least cast a piece of old cloth over the corpse for\r\ndecency's sake and buried it out of sight, although without any attempt to\r\nmake a grave and \"without any office of priest or clerk.\" Thus, it\r\nremained till the following month of February, when it was disinterred and\r\ntaken to Exeter. The treatment of Bishop Stapleton caused other prelates\r\nto look to themselves, and many of them, including the primate himself,\r\nbegan to make overtures of submission to Queen Isabel.\r\n\r\nAfter the Bishop's murder there was no pretence of government in the city.\r\nThe mob did exactly as they liked. They sacked the houses of Baldock, the\r\nChancellor, and carried off the treasure he had laid up in St. Paul's. The\r\nproperty of the Earl of Arundel, recently executed at Hereford, which lay\r\nin the Priory of Holy Trinity, Aldgate, shared the same fate. The banking\r\nhouse of the Bardi, containing the wealth accumulated by the younger\r\nDespenser, was sacked under cover of night. The Tower was entered, the\r\nprisoners set free, and new officers appointed.(418) All this was done in\r\nthe face of a proclamation, calling upon the citizens to sink their\r\ndifferences and to settle their disputes by lawful means.(419)\r\n\r\n(M255) (M256)\r\n\r\nWhen the Feast of St. Simon and Jude again came round, and Chigwell's term\r\nof office expired by efflux of time, no election of a successor took\r\nplace, but on the 15th November, the Bishop of Winchester paid a visit to\r\nthe Guildhall, where, after receiving the freedom of the city, and\r\nswearing \"to live and die with them in the cause, and to maintain the\r\nfranchise,\" he presented a letter from the queen, permitting the citizens\r\nfreely to elect their mayor as in the days before the Iter of 1321, for\r\nsince that time no mayor had been elected, save only by the king's\r\nfavour.(420) They at once elected Richard de Betoyne, whom the queen had\r\nthat day appointed Warden of the Tower, conjointly with John de\r\nGisors.(421) Thus were these two aldermen recompensed for the assistance\r\nthey had rendered Mortimer in his escape from the Tower.\r\n\r\n(M257)\r\n\r\nOn the 13th January, 1327--exactly one week before the king met his\r\nwretched end in Berkeley Castle--Mortimer came to the Guildhall with a\r\nlarge company including the Archbishop of Canterbury and several bishops,\r\nand one and all made oath to maintain the cause of the queen and of her\r\nson, and to preserve the liberties of the City of London. This was\r\nsolemnly done in the presence of the mayor, the chamberlain, Andrew Horn,\r\nand a vast concourse of citizens. The Archbishop, who had offended many of\r\nthe citizens by annulling the decree of exile passed against the\r\nDespensers in 1321, now sought their favour by the public offer of a gift\r\nto the commonalty of 50 tuns of wine.(422)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(M258)\r\n\r\nEdward III was only fourteen years of age when he succeeded to the throne.\r\nFor the first three years of his reign the government of the country was\r\npractically in the hands of Mortimer, his mother's paramour; and it was no\r\ndoubt by his advice and that of the queen-mother that the young king\r\nrewarded the citizens of London, who had shown him so much favour, by\r\ngranting them not only a general pardon(423) for offences committed since\r\nhe set foot in England in September, 1326, but also a charter confirming\r\nand enlarging their ancient liberties.(424)\r\n\r\nThis latter charter, which has been held to be of the force of an Act of\r\nParliament,(425) established (among other things) the ferm of the\r\nSheriffwick of London and Middlesex at the original sum of L300 per annum,\r\ninstead of the increased rental of L400 which had been paid since\r\n1270;(426) it appointed the mayor one of the justices at the gaol delivery\r\nof Newgate, as well as the king's escheator of felon's goods within the\r\ncity; it gave the citizens the right of devising real estate within the\r\ncity; it restored to them all the privileges they had enjoyed before the\r\nmemorable Iter of the last reign; and granted to them a monopoly of\r\nmarkets within a circuit of seven miles of the city.(427) These two\r\ncharters--the charter of pardon and the charter of liberties--together with\r\nanother charter(428) releasing the citizens from all debts due to the late\r\nking, were publicly read and explained in English to the citizens\r\nassembled at the Guildhall by Andrew Horn, the Chamberlain, on the 9th\r\nMarch.(429)\r\n\r\n(M259)\r\n\r\nScarcely was he knighted and crowned king before necessity compelled him\r\nto take the field against the Scots. The Londoners were, as usual, called\r\nupon to supply a contingent towards the forces which had been ordered to\r\nassemble at Newcastle-upon-Tyne.(430) They responded to the king's appeal\r\nby sending 100 horsemen fully equipped, each one supplied with the sum of\r\n100 shillings at least for expenses, and a further contingent of 100\r\nfoot-men. They made their rendezvous at West Smithfield, whence they\r\nproceeded to \"la Barnette.\"(431)\r\n\r\n(M260)\r\n\r\nWhilst furnishing this aid to the king the citizens were anxious that\r\ntheir liberality should not be misconstrued, or tend to establish a\r\nprecedent in derogation of their chartered privileges. Their fears on this\r\nscore were set at rest by the receipt of letters patent from the king\r\ndeclaring that their proceedings on this occasion should not be to their\r\nprejudice.(432)\r\n\r\n(M261)\r\n\r\nA parliament held in September, at Lincoln, in which the citizens were\r\nrepresented by Benedict de Fulsham and Robert de Kelseye,(433) granted the\r\nking an aid of a twentieth to defray expenses; and Hamo de Chigwell, among\r\nothers, was appointed by the king to collect the tax from the\r\ncitizens.(434)\r\n\r\n(M262)\r\n\r\nThe City's representatives were accompanied to Lincoln by the mayor,\r\nRichard de Betoyne, who was the bearer of letters under the seal of the\r\ncommonalty addressed to the king, the queen, and members of the king's\r\ncouncil praying that the courts of King's Bench and Exchequer might not be\r\nremoved from Westminster to York.(435) The removal was inconvenient to the\r\ncity merchants, whatever advantage might accrue to those dwelling in the\r\nnorth of England. Negotiations between the City and the king on this\r\nsubject were protracted for some weeks; the king at length promising that\r\nthe courts should return to Westminster as soon as the country was in a\r\nmore settled state.(436)\r\n\r\n(M263)\r\n\r\nThe campaign against the Scots brought little credit to either side, and\r\nterminated in a treaty, the terms of which were for the most part arranged\r\nby Mortimer and the queen-mother. One of the articles of peace stipulated\r\nfor the surrender of all proofs of the subjection of Scotland; and\r\naccordingly the abbot of Westminster received orders to deliver up the\r\nstone of Scone to the Sheriffs of London for transmission to Isabel, who\r\nwas in the north.(437) This the abbot refused to do--\"for reasons touching\r\nGod and the church,\"--without further instructions from the king and his\r\ncouncil.(438)\r\n\r\nWhen negotiations were opened in 1363 for the union of the kingdoms of\r\nEngland and Scotland, it was proposed that Edward should be crowned king\r\nat Scone on the royal seat (_siege roial_) which he should cause to be\r\nreturned from England. These negotiations, however, fell through, and the\r\nstone remains in Westminster Abbey to this day.(439)\r\n\r\nThe treaty which had been arranged at Edinburgh (17 March, 1328), was\r\nafterwards confirmed by a Parliament held at Northampton, in which the\r\ncity was represented by Richard de Betoyne and Robert de Kelseye.(440)\r\n\r\n(M264)\r\n\r\nWhen the terms of this treaty of Northampton (as it was called) came to be\r\nfully understood, the nation began to realise the measure of disgrace\r\nwhich they involved, and Mortimer and the queen became the objects of\r\nbitter hatred. Henry, Earl of Lancaster, the king's nominal guardian, had\r\ngrown weary of his false position, and of serving only as Mortimer's tool.\r\nDetermined to throw off the yoke, he refused to attend a parliament which\r\nmet at Salisbury in October (1328),(441) unless certain changes in the\r\ngovernment and in the king's household were first made. In the meantime,\r\nBishop Stratford of Winchester and Thomas, Lord Wake, two of his\r\nsupporters, had paid a visit to the city and had endeavoured to rouse the\r\ncitizens to action. The king, hearing of this, wrote to the municipal\r\nauthorities for an explanation. They frankly acknowledged, in reply, that\r\nthe bishop had been in the city for the purpose of discussing the ill\r\nstate of affairs, and themselves expressed a hope, amid vows of the utmost\r\nloyalty, that the king would redress the grievances under which the nation\r\nsuffered.(442)\r\n\r\n(M265)\r\n\r\nInstead of attending the parliament at Salisbury, the earl marched in full\r\nforce to Winchester. On the 5th November he wrote to the citizens from\r\nHungerford, to the effect that he had made known to parliament his\r\nhonourable intentions, but had received no reply; that the parliament had\r\nbeen adjourned to London; that he had been informed of certain matters\r\nabout which he could not write, but which the bearer would communicate to\r\nthem; and he concluded with assuring them that he desired nothing so much\r\nas the king's honour and the welfare of the kingdom, and declaring his\r\nimplicit confidence in their loyalty.(443)\r\n\r\n(M266)\r\n\r\nThe mayor of the city at this time was John de Grantham. His election had\r\ntaken place but recently, and was the result of a compromise. Chigwell,\r\nwho had again been chosen mayor at the expiration of Betoyne's year of\r\noffice in 1327, was a decided favourite with the citizens, notwithstanding\r\na certain want of firmness of character, and he was again put up as a\r\ncandidate for the mayoralty in October, 1328. He had enemies, of course.\r\nTowards the close of his last mayoralty he was ill-advised enough to sit\r\nin judgment upon a brother alderman on a charge of having abused him two\r\nyears previously. During the troublous times of 1326, John de Cotun,\r\nalderman of Walbrook ward, was alleged to have described Chigwell, who was\r\nthen mayor, as \"the vilest worm that had been in the city for twenty\r\nyears,\" adding that the city would know no peace so long as Chigwell was\r\nalive, and that it would be a blessing if he lost his head.(444) After\r\nsome hard swearing on both sides, leading to the discovery of bad blood\r\nexisting between the informer and the alderman, the charge was dismissed.\r\n\r\nAt the outset it appeared that Chigwell's reelection was assured; but the\r\ncity as well as the country was in a disturbed state, and political\r\nreasons may have led to an endeavour to force another candidate in the\r\nperson of Benedict de Fulsham over his head. Be that as it may, it is\r\ncertain that when Chigwell's name was proposed to the assembled citizens\r\nat the Guildhall, the cry was raised of \"Fulsham! Fulsham!\" So high did\r\nparty spirit run, that the election had to be postponed, and eventually it\r\nwas thought best that both candidates should be withdrawn. This having\r\nbeen done, the choice of the electors fell on John de Grantham, a\r\npepperer.(445)\r\n\r\n(M267)\r\n\r\nOn the 8th November the new mayor despatched a letter to the king,\r\nexpressing the joy of the city at the news of a proposed visit, and the\r\nprospect of the next parliament being held in London. His majesty might be\r\nassured of the city's loyalty.(446) Four days later (12 November), Edward\r\ndespatched a messenger from Reading with a letter to John de Grantham,\r\nbidding him cause a deputation to be nominated for the purpose of\r\nproceeding to Windsor. The messenger arrived late on Sunday evening, and\r\nthe deputation was to be at Windsor on the following Tuesday. A meeting\r\nwas therefore summoned on Monday, when six aldermen and six commoners were\r\nnominated to meet the king. On Thursday the deputation returned and\r\nreported the result of the interview. It appears that Edward had\r\ncomplained to the deputation of armed men having left the city to join the\r\nearl at Winchester. He was also desirous to know if the city was in a\r\nproper state of defence and the king's peace preserved therein. On these\r\npoints the mayor endeavoured to satisfy him by letter of the 18th\r\nNovember. As to armed men having left the city for Winchester, his majesty\r\nwas informed that none had so left with the knowledge of the municipal\r\nauthorities, and if any should be found to have done so, they would most\r\nassuredly be punished.(447)\r\n\r\n(M268)\r\n\r\nEarly in December the king and queen came to London, accompanied by the\r\nqueen-mother and Mortimer, and took up their quarters at Westminster. The\r\nwhole of the city went forth to welcome them, and they were made the\r\nrecipients of valuable gifts. Their stay, however, lasted but one short\r\nweek.(448)\r\n\r\n(M269)\r\n\r\nBy the 16th the king was at Gloucester, where he wrote to the Mayor of\r\nLondon, enclosing a copy of particulars of all that had passed between\r\nhimself and the Earl of Lancaster--the charges made by the earl and his own\r\nreplies--in order, as he said, that the citizens might judge for themselves\r\nof the rights of the quarrel between them. These particulars, the mayor\r\nwas desired to have publicly read at the Guildhall.(449) This was\r\naccordingly done (20 Dec.), in the presence of some of the earl's\r\nsupporters, who took the opportunity of explaining the earl's\r\nposition.(450)\r\n\r\n(M270)\r\n\r\nWhilst notifying the king that his wishes had been complied with, the\r\nmayor and commonalty besought him that all measures of hostility between\r\nhimself and the barons might be suspended until parliament should meet.\r\nThe city became the headquarters of the dissatisfied bishops and nobles.\r\nThe Sunday before Christmas, the pulpit in St. Paul's was occupied by the\r\nprimate, who was equally anxious with the civic authorities that matters\r\nshould be left to be adjusted by parliament.(451)\r\n\r\n(M271)\r\n\r\nThe barons in the city, in the meanwhile, awaited the arrival of the Earl\r\nof Lancaster. On New Year's day he came, and on the 2nd January (1329) a\r\nconference of bishops and barons took place at St. Paul's.(452) The\r\nfutility of an attempt to form a confederation soon became apparent. The\r\ncity stood fast to the king; some of the barons wavered, and nothing was\r\nleft to Lancaster but to make the best terms he could. Edward had already\r\noffered pardon to all who should submit before the 7th January, with\r\ncertain exceptions.(453)\r\n\r\n(M272)\r\n\r\nNow that the king, or rather, we should say, Mortimer, was once more\r\nmaster of the situation, the citizens who had favoured the constitutional\r\nparty became the objects of retribution. On Sunday, the 22nd January\r\n(1329), the mayor and twenty-four citizens were ordered to meet the king\r\nat St. Albans. They returned on the following Thursday with instructions\r\nto see if the city was prepared to punish those who had favoured\r\nLancaster. No sooner were the king's wishes made known, than an enquiry\r\nwas at once set on foot. On Wednesday (1st February), the deputation\r\nreturned to the king, who was then at Windsor, to report the sense of the\r\ncity; and on the following Sunday (4th February), the king's justices\r\ncommenced to sit at the Guildhall for the trial of those implicated in the\r\nlate abortive attempt to overthrow Mortimer. Three days were consumed in\r\npreliminary proceedings; and it was not until Wednesday (8th February)\r\nthat the real business of the session commenced.  By that time the king\r\nhimself had come to London, and had taken up his headquarters at the\r\nTower, having passed through the city accompanied by his consort, the\r\nqueen-mother, and many of the nobility.(454) It does not appear that\r\nMortimer came with them.\r\n\r\n(M273)\r\n\r\nAmong those who were brought to trial at the Guildhall was Chigwell. He\r\nwas accused of being implicated in the abduction of the Abbot of Bury St.\r\nEdmunds, and of feloniously receiving two silver basins as his share of\r\nthe plunder. Being convicted, he claimed the benefit of clergy, and the\r\nBishop of London, after some delay, was allowed to take possession of him\r\non the ground that he was a clerk. His life was thus saved and he was\r\nconveyed to the episcopal prison amid general regret, although, as we have\r\nalready seen, he was not a universal favourite. \"Many said, he is a good\r\nman; others, nay, but he deceiveth the people.\"(455) He was kept for some\r\nmonths in honourable confinement at the bishop's manor of Orset, co.\r\nEssex, and early in 1330 was admitted to purgation. Thus encouraged, he\r\nhastened once more to return to the city. He was still popular with a\r\nlarge body of the citizens, who, on hearing of his approach, flocked to\r\nmeet him, his re-entry into the city being made to resemble a triumphal\r\nprogress. Both Isabel and her son were seized with alarm; and a writ was\r\nforthwith issued for his arrest.(456) He was, however, forewarned, and\r\nable to make his escape. Little is known of his subsequent career; Stow\r\nplaces his death in or about 1328, but this must be a mistake. By his will\r\ndated 1332, he left some real estate in the city to the dean and chapter\r\nof St. Paul's Cathedral for the maintenance of a chantry.(457)\r\n\r\n(M274)\r\n\r\nMortimer's vengeance was not confined to a few leading citizens.\r\nLancaster's life was spared, but he was mulcted in a heavy fine. Many of\r\nhis associates took refuge in flight. The Earl of Kent, the king's uncle,\r\nwas shortly afterwards charged with treason, into which he had been drawn\r\nby the subtlety of Mortimer, and made to pay the penalty with his head.\r\nThis, more than anything else, opened the king's eyes to Mortimer's true\r\ncharacter, and at length (Oct., 1339,) he caused him to be privily seized\r\nin the castle of Nottingham.(458) Thence he was carried to London, and\r\nhanged at the Elms in Smithfield.\r\n\r\n(M275)\r\n\r\nQueen Isabel, who witnessed the seizure of her favourite and whose prayers\r\nto spare the \"gentle Mortimer\" were of no avail, was made to disgorge much\r\nof the wealth she had acquired during her supremacy, and was put on an\r\nallowance. The rest of her life, a period of nearly thirty years, she\r\nspent in retirement. Before her death(459) she gave the sum of forty\r\nshillings to the Abbess and Minoresses of Aldgate of the Order of St.\r\nClare, for the purpose of purchasing for themselves two pittances or doles\r\non the anniversaries of the decease of her husband the late king and of\r\nSir John de Eltham his son.(460) The removal of Mortimer corresponded very\r\nclosely with the king's coming of age. He was now eighteen years old, and\r\nthenceforth he \"ruled as well as reigned.\"\r\n\r\n(M276)\r\n\r\nThe king's marriage with Philippa of Hainault, which had taken place at\r\nYork on the 30th January, 1328, had been popular with the city(461) as\r\ntending to open up trade with Flanders. Hitherto nearly all the wool\r\nproduced by this country had been sent to Flanders for manufacture, the\r\nexport trade being so large that the king is said to have received more\r\nthan L30,000 in a single year from duties levied on this commodity\r\nalone.(462) We have already seen how, in order to punish the Countess of\r\nFlanders for injuries inflicted upon English merchants, the king's\r\ngrandfather resorted, in 1270, to the expedient of forbidding all export\r\nof wool to her country.(463) The misery which her half-starved people were\r\nthen compelled to suffer soon induced the Countess to come to terms. It\r\nwas also in no small measure owing to the fear of a similar stoppage by\r\nthe intervention of the French fleet, that the Flemings laid aside their\r\nneutrality in 1339, and openly assisted Edward in his war with France.\r\n\r\n(M277)\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the last reign the \"staples\" or market towns for the\r\nsale of certain commodities, but more especially of wool, had been removed\r\nfrom the continent and established at various places in England, Ireland\r\nand Wales.(464) London was one of those places. No wool was to be exported\r\nabroad until it had remained at one or another of the staples for a period\r\nof forty days. This rule appears however to have been relaxed by Edward\r\nII, in favour of all staple towns but London; merchants being allowed to\r\nremove their goods from other staples after a stay of only fifteen days.\r\nThe London merchants, therefore, were under the disadvantage of finding\r\nthe market always forestalled. Edward III had not long been on the throne\r\nbefore they took the opportunity of submitting this hardship not only to\r\nthe king, but also to the queen-mother, and prayed that the relaxation of\r\nthe rule touching the forty days with respect to other staples might be\r\nwithdrawn.(465) Their prayer, however, would seem to have had but little\r\neffect, for within a week of the petition to the king we find that monarch\r\nissuing an order to the collector of customs on wool, leather and\r\nwool-fells in the port of London, to enforce the delay of forty days\r\nbefore goods could be removed.(466)\r\n\r\n(M278)\r\n\r\nNor was this the only grievance that the London merchants had. In order to\r\nraise money to put down the rebellion of the Scots which had broken out\r\nsoon after his accession, he had recourse to an extra tax upon wool,\r\nleather, and wool-fells. The money thus raised was to be considered a\r\nloan, receipts being given to the merchants under the king's seal, known\r\nas \"Coket,\" and the merchants in return were to be allowed absolute free\r\ntrade from the 2nd July, 1327, the date of the writ, up to the following\r\nChristmas.(467) The Londoners objected altogether to this impost, on the\r\ngrounds that they had never been consulted on the matter, and had never\r\ngiven their assent.(468)\r\n\r\nA compromise was subsequently effected. In consideration of the good\r\nservice which the citizens of London had already done to the king in times\r\npast, and for the good service which they were prepared to render again in\r\nthe future, they were released of arrears of the tax due from 2nd July to\r\nthe 23rd September, provided they were willing to pay it for the remainder\r\nof the term.(469) After Christmas the restrictions upon free trade were\r\nagain enforced.(470)\r\n\r\n(M279)\r\n\r\nOn the 11th December (1327), Edward issued a writ(471) to the Sheriffs of\r\nLondon to choose two representatives to attend on behalf of the citizens\r\nat a parliament to be held at York, on Sunday next after the Feast of the\r\nPurification (2 Feb., 1328). Instead, however, of sending only two members\r\nas directed, the citizens appear on this occasion to have sent no less\r\nthan four, viz.: Richard de Betoyne, Robert de Kelseye, John de Grantham,\r\nand John Priour the Younger.(472)\r\n\r\nOne of the questions to be determined was the advisability of again\r\nremoving the Staple from England to the continent. On this question, there\r\nappears to have arisen some difference of opinion among the city\r\nrepresentatives. Betoyne, who had formerly enjoyed the office of Mayor of\r\nthe Staple beyond the seas, favoured a return to the old order of things,\r\nwhilst his colleagues were opposed to any such proceeding. Notification of\r\nBetoyne's disagreement with his colleagues was made to the mayor and\r\ncommonalty of the City by letter from the mayor and commonalty of York, to\r\nwhich reply was made that Betoyne's action was entirely unauthorised.(473)\r\nA letter was sent the same day to Betoyne himself, enjoining him to do\r\nnothing in the matter opposed to the wish of the commonalty of\r\nLondon(474); and another to Betoyne's colleagues informing them of the\r\nCity's action, and bidding them to exert themselves to the utmost to keep\r\nthe Staple in England.(475)\r\n\r\nThe account of Betoyne's difference with his colleagues, as related in the\r\nletter from the City of York, was subsequently found to require\r\nconsiderable modification, when a letter was received by the Mayor of\r\nLondon from two of his colleagues, Grantham and Priour.(476) Their account\r\nof what had actually taken place was to the effect that Betoyne had been\r\npublicly requested by a number of representatives from various towns,\r\nassembled in the Chapter House at York, to resign his mayoralty (of the\r\nStaple) and to deliver up the charters which had been acquired at no\r\nlittle expense. Betoyne replied that the charters were in the possession\r\nof John de Charleton,(477) who refused to give them up, but that he had\r\nhimself, four years since, caused a transcript of the charters to be made,\r\nwhich he was prepared to give up to them if they so wished. Thereupon,\r\nthere suddenly appeared upon the scene the Mayor of York, hand in hand\r\nwith John de Charleton himself, and followed by a number of burgesses of\r\nYork. The appearance of John de Charleton was eminently distasteful to\r\nBetoyne, and he got up and left the room, declining to take any further\r\npart in the discussion so long as Charleton was present. That was\r\npractically all that had occurred, and the writers expressed themselves as\r\nmuch hurt if anything more than this had been reported from the mayor and\r\ncommonalty of York, for in their opinion Betoyne had never shown himself\r\notherwise than diligent in his duty. The letter concluded with a report of\r\ngeneral news, the chief item being the announcement of the death of the\r\nKing of France, and the writers expressed a wish that the same publicity\r\nmight be given to their letter as was given to the letter received from\r\nthe Mayor of York.\r\n\r\n(M280)\r\n\r\nBetoyne on the same day sent home his own account of what had taken place\r\nat York.(478) It agrees in the main with the account sent by his\r\ncolleagues, but contains some particulars of interest not mentioned in the\r\nlatter. He relates how he had been asked to retire from the Mayoralty of\r\nthe Staple beyond the seas, and to give up the charters and other\r\nmuniments which the several towns had obtained at considerable cost. To\r\nthis he had replied that many charters he had left behind on the\r\ncontinent, but he had brought over with him the charters of the franchises\r\nof the staples which had been purchased of the late king. These were in\r\nthe hands of John de Charleton, who refused to give them up. He had\r\nhimself, however, gone to Dover in the eighteenth year of Edward II, when\r\nthe king himself was there, and had caused a duplicate of the charters to\r\nbe made, which he had expressed his readiness to show them. He encloses a\r\ncopy. As a proof of the bad feeling (_la malencolye_) which the burgesses\r\nof York entertained towards him, he proceeds to relate how the Mayor of\r\nYork, maliciously and without any warning, had appeared at the assembly\r\nwith four or five of his suite, accompanied by John de Charleton, clothed\r\nin the mayor's livery, and by a crowd of citizens, to the terror of the\r\nassembled merchants. Thereupon, Bretoyne had declared that he would not\r\nsit nor remain where Charleton was, and had left the meeting; for, said\r\nhe, he would never make peace with Charleton except with the assent of the\r\nMayor and Commonalty of London. He concluded by asking that his character\r\nmight not be allowed to suffer by anything which the Mayor of York may\r\nhave written. By a postscript he informs the Mayor of London, that on the\r\neve of the Purification (the day fixed for the re-assembly of parliament)\r\nthe Mayor of York had come to his hostel, accompanied by many others, and\r\nhad accused him of having come to the city for the express purpose of\r\nannoying their fellow-burgess John de Charleton, which he had denied. This\r\ninsult, he is advised, touches not only himself, but the Corporation of\r\nLondon whose representative he was.\r\n\r\n(M281)\r\n\r\nBoth these letters were laid before the commonalty of London assembled at\r\nthe Guildhall on the 19th February, when Betoyne's action was approved,\r\nand on the following day a letter was addressed to him to that effect. The\r\nMayor and Commonalty of York received also a missive in which their late\r\nconduct to Betoyne was severely criticised.(479) Betoyne's recent services\r\nwere recognized by the grant, at his own request, of a handsome coverlet\r\nfurred with minever, in part payment of his expenses incurred in attending\r\nthe parliament at York.(480)\r\n\r\n(M282)\r\n\r\nThe king, finding that the opposition to the removal of the staple\r\ndisplayed not only by London but by York, Winchester, Bristol and Lincoln\r\nwas too great to be overcome, abolished staples altogether (August, 1328),\r\nand re-established free-trade.(481) He even invited Flemish weavers to\r\nsettle in England so as to give a stimulus to the manufacture of woollen\r\nfabrics. These he took under his special protection,(482) for the native\r\nlooked askance upon all foreigners, traders or craftsmen.\r\n\r\n(M283)\r\n\r\nOne of the last political acts of Mortimer had been to send Edward over to\r\nFrance to do homage to Philip of Valois, the new king, for his possessions\r\nin that country. This homage Edward paid in 1329, but subject to certain\r\nreservations.(483) In 1330 he was making preparations for war, and took\r\nthe opportunity of the presence of Stephen de Abyndone and John de\r\nCaustone, the City's representatives in the parliament held that year at\r\nWestminster, to ask them what assistance the City would be likely to\r\nafford him. The City members asked leave to consult the commonalty on the\r\nmatter. Eventually the sum of 1,000 marks was offered, a sum so trifling\r\nthat Edward consented to accept it only as a free gift, and plainly\r\nintimated that he looked for more substantial aid in the future.(484)\r\n\r\nIn July, he summoned the mayor and twenty-four of the leading citizens to\r\nattend him at Woodstock. The mayor (Simon de Swanlonde) would have had\r\nthem excused on the ground of the disturbed state of the city, but the\r\nking was not to be denied. Substitutes were appointed for the mayor during\r\nhis absence, and he and seven aldermen and sixteen commoners went to\r\nWoodstock, where they gave assurances of the City's loyalty.(485) In 1331,\r\nafter Mortimer's fall, when Edward was his own master, lie again visited\r\nFrance, and a peace was concluded between the two kings.(486)\r\n\r\n(M284)\r\n\r\nFrom 1332 to 1335 the king was chiefly occupied with Scotland. It was part\r\nof the policy of Philip of Valois to encourage disturbance in the north of\r\nEngland, as a means of recovering his lost possessions in France.(487) The\r\nperiod of four years during which peace had been assured by Edward with\r\nScotland by the treaty of Northampton had now elapsed,(488) and active\r\noperations on both sides re-commenced. In 1334 the city voted 1,000 marks,\r\nafterwards raised to 1,200, for raising 100 horsemen and as many\r\nmen-at-arms to assist the king for a period of forty days.(489)\r\n\r\nA spy was also despatched to Normandy and Brabant to see how matters were\r\ngoing there, and gifts were made to the courts of Juliers and Namur to\r\nsecure their favour. The parliament which sat at York in May, 1335,(490)\r\nhaving decided in favour of a fresh expedition to Scotland,(491) the king\r\nsent orders to the City to hold its forces in readiness to march under the\r\nleadership of two of its aldermen, John de Pulteney and Reginald de\r\nConduit.(492) A commission to seize ships in the port of London to the\r\nking's use, resulted in the detention of six ships.(493)\r\n\r\n(M285)\r\n\r\nAt length, the friendly attitude which Philip of Valois had taken up\r\ntowards Scotland, much to Edward's prejudice, determined the latter to go\r\nin person to France for the purpose, not only of defending his possessions\r\nthere, but also of enforcing his claim to the French crown. The year 1337\r\nwas devoted to active preparations for the struggle. The City of London,\r\nin spite of its franchise, was called upon to furnish 500 men at arms, and\r\nto send them to Portsmouth by Whitsuntide.(494) The date was subsequently\r\naltered to Trinity Sunday.(495) The king took occasion to find fault with\r\nthe city's dilatoriness in executing his demands, as well as with the\r\nphysique of the men that were being supplied. At the request of the mayor,\r\nSir John de Pulteney (he had recently received the honour of\r\nknighthood(496)), the number of men to be furnished was reduced to 200,\r\nthe rest to be supplied on further notice.(497)\r\n\r\n(M286)\r\n\r\nWhen Parliament met in London in February, the City made presents of money\r\nto the king, the queen, the chancellor, the treasurer, and others,(498)\r\nfor no other purpose apparently, but to win their favour. In the following\r\nmonth the City obtained a charter declaring its liberties and customs to\r\nbe unaffected by the recent statute establishing free trade,(499) when\r\npresents in money or kind were again made to the officers of state.(500)\r\n\r\n(M287)\r\n\r\nThe services which the mayor had done the city in the work of obtaining\r\nthis charter were acknowledged by a gift of two silver basins and the sum\r\nof L20 from his fellow citizens.(501) It was by Pulteney's influence that\r\nthe king consented to allow a sum of 1,000 marks to be taken into account\r\nat a future assessment for a fifteenth, instead of insisting upon its\r\nbeing a free gift from the citizens.(502)\r\n\r\n(M288)\r\n\r\nIn March, 1337, a statute forbade the importation of wool, as a\r\npreliminary to the imposition of an additional custom, and in the\r\nfollowing year parliament granted the king half the wool of the\r\nkingdom.(503) The Londoners having no wool of their own, paid a\r\ncomposition,(504) and were often reduced to sore straits. Thus in April,\r\n1339, an assessment had to be made in the several wards of the City to\r\ndischarge a debt to the king of 1,000 marks. The men of Aldersgate ward\r\nrefused to pay their quota of L9. A precept was thereupon issued to the\r\nsheriffs to levy the larger sum of L16 10s., on the lands, tenements,\r\ngoods, and chattels of the ward, and pay the same into the Chamber of the\r\nGuildhall by a certain day.(505) The citizens of London, and the nation\r\ngenerally, would the more willingly have borne these exactions if any\r\nadequate good had resulted from them. But Edward's first campaign resulted\r\nin nothing more than the assumption by him of the name and arms of the\r\nKing of France, at a cost of L300,000.(506)\r\n\r\n(M289)\r\n\r\nAmong the ships which had been prepared for the king's expedition to\r\nFrance, three were known as \"La Jonette,\" of London; \"La Cogge,\" of All\r\nHallows; and \"La Sainte Marie Cogge.\" The last mentioned belonged to\r\nWilliam Haunsard,(507) an ex-sheriff of London, who subsequently did\r\nsignal service in the great naval battle of Sluys. Prior to the king's\r\ndeparture, measures were taken for the safe custody of the city during his\r\nabsence.(508) The City had difficulties in raising a contingent of\r\nsoldiers, for many of the best men had joined the retinue of nobles, and\r\nall that could be mustered amounted to no more than 100 men, viz: 40\r\nmen-at-arms, and 60 archers.(509)\r\n\r\n(M290)\r\n\r\nAfter the king's departure (12 July, 1338) the City laid in provisions for\r\ntransmission abroad, 500 quarters of corn and 100 carcases of oxen to be\r\nsalted down. In addition to which it purchased 1,000 horseshoes and 30,000\r\nnails.(510) In October steps were taken to protect London from attack by\r\nsea and land. Piles were driven into the bed of the river to prevent the\r\napproach of a hostile fleet; the wharves were \"bretasched\" with boards,\r\nand springalds set at different gates and posterns.(511)\r\n\r\n(M291)\r\n\r\nIn February, 1339, the citizens received the king's orders to furnish four\r\nships with 300 men, and four scummars(512) with 160 men, victualled for\r\nthree months, to proceed to Winchester. Upon some demur being made to this\r\ndemand, the number of ships was reduced to two, well equipped with men and\r\narms. Pursuant to these orders each ward was assessed for the purpose of\r\nlevying 110 men armed with haketon, plates, bacinet with aventail, and\r\ngloves of plate; and sixty men armed with only haketon and bacinet. The\r\npay of the men was to be threepence a day each for two months. The vessels\r\nwere to be joined by ships from various other ports, and proceed to sea in\r\ncharge of Sir William Trussel by the middle of March to intercept, if\r\npossible, the enemy's fleet.(513)\r\n\r\n(M292)\r\n\r\nBy Easter time the danger appeared more imminent, and the mayor and\r\naldermen met hurriedly in the Guildhall, on Easter Sunday afternoon after\r\ndinner. An immediate attack up the Thames was expected. The mayor and\r\naldermen agreed to take it in turns to watch the river night and day. On\r\nthe following Wednesday, each alderman was ordered to enquire as to the\r\nnumber of arbalesters, archers, and men capable of bearing arms in his\r\nward. A number of carpenters were sworn on the same day to safe-guard the\r\nengines of war laid up in the new house near Petywales.(514) This new\r\nhouse appears to have been known as \"La Bretaske,\" and was used for\r\nstoring springalds, quarels, and other war material.(515)\r\n\r\n(M293)\r\n\r\nAt this period there were kept in the chamber of the Guildhall six\r\ninstruments called \"gonnes,\" which were made of latten, a metal closely\r\nresembling brass, five \"teleres\" or stocks for supporting the guns, four\r\ncwt. and a half of pellets of lead, and thirty-two pounds of gunpowder by\r\nway of ammunition.(516) The mention of \"teleres\" and the small amount of\r\nammunition favours the assumption that the instruments were rather\r\nhand-guns than heavy pieces, as has been supposed.(517) A \"telere\" or\r\ntiller was a common name for the stock of a cross-bow,(518) and the\r\nearliest hand-guns or fire-arms known consisted of a simple tube of metal\r\nwith touch-hole, fixed on a straight stick or shaft, which when used was\r\npassed under the arm so as to afford a better grip of the weapon.\r\n\r\n(M294)\r\n\r\nThe danger blew over, and before the close of the year the king was\r\nexpected to return to England.(519) He did not return however before\r\nFebruary, 1340, having intimated his intention to the mayor of London, by\r\nletter from Sluys, dated Sunday the 20th.(520) Notwithstanding his long\r\nabsence, he had accomplished little or nothing.\r\n\r\n(M295)\r\n\r\nHe had come to the end of his resources and was in want of money to carry\r\non the war. The City was asked to lend him L20,000. It offered 5,000\r\nmarks. This was contemptuously refused, and the municipal authorities were\r\nbidden to re-consider the matter, or in the alternative to furnish the\r\nking with the names of the wealthier inhabitants of the City. At length\r\nthe City agreed to advance the sum of L5,000 for a fixed period, and this\r\noffer the king was fain to accept.(521) At the close of 1339, the chief\r\ntowns of Flanders had entered into an offensive and defensive alliance\r\nwith Edward, and an arrangement was made for paying the sum of L1,500 out\r\nof the L5,000 to Jacques van Arteveldt, the king's agent at Bruges.(522)\r\nThree aldermen and nine commoners were appointed to make the necessary\r\nassessment for the loan, for the repayment of which John de Pulteney was\r\none of the king's sureties.(523)\r\n\r\n(M296)\r\n\r\nProvided with this and other money supplied by parliament, Edward again\r\nset out for the continent (June, 1340). With him went a contingent of 283\r\nmen-at-arms, furnished by the City, 140 of them being drawn from that part\r\nof the city which lay on the east side of Walbrook, and 143 from the\r\nwestern side. It had been intended to raise 300 men, and the better class\r\nof citizens had been called upon to supply each a quota, or in default to\r\nserve in person; but eleven had failed in their duty and, on that account,\r\nhad been fined 50 shillings each, whilst six others, making up the\r\ndeficit, had set out in the retinue of Henry Darcy, the late mayor.(524)\r\n\r\n(M297)\r\n\r\nThe names of the transport ships and the number of men-at-arms supplied by\r\neach city, the number of mariners and serving-men (_garzouns_), which were\r\nabout to take part in the great battle fought off Sluys (24 June), are on\r\nrecord.(525) Although the French fleet was superior to his own in numbers\r\nand equipment, Edward did not hesitate to attack. The struggle was long\r\nand severe, lasting from noon on one day until six o'clock the next\r\nmorning. If any one person was more conspicuous for valour on that\r\noccasion than another, it was William Haunsard, an ex-sheriff of London,\r\nwho came with \"a ship of London\" and \"did much good.\"(526)\r\n\r\nAn account of the battle was despatched by the king to his son the Prince\r\nRegent, dated from his ship, the \"Cogg Thomas,\" the 28th June.(527)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(M298)\r\n\r\nIt was one of the conditions of the Flemish alliance, mentioned at the\r\nclose of the last chapter, that the campaign of 1340 should open with the\r\nsiege of Tournay, and it was with this object specially in view that\r\nEdward had set out from England. After his brilliant victory over the\r\nFrench fleet which opposed his passage Edward marched upon Tournay. Its\r\nsiege, however, proved fruitless, and, disappointed and money-less, he\r\nslipt back again to England and made his appearance unexpectedly one\r\nmorning at the Tower(528) (30 Nov.).\r\n\r\n(M299) (M300)\r\n\r\nThe king attributed the failure of the war to the remissness of his\r\nministers in sending money and supplies. Scarcely had he landed before he\r\nsent for the chancellor, the treasurer, and other ministers who were in\r\nLondon, and not only dismissed them from office, but ordered them each\r\ninto separate confinement. John de Pulteney was one of those made to feel\r\nthe king's anger, and he was relegated to the castle of Somerton, but as\r\nsoon as Edward's irritability had passed off he and others obtained their\r\nfreedom.(529) A searching enquiry was instituted in the spring of the\r\nfollowing year (1341) as to the way in which the king's revenues had been\r\ncollected in the city. Objection was raised to the judges holding their\r\nsession within the city and they sat at the Tower. Great tumult prevailed,\r\nand the citizens refused to answer any questions until the judges had\r\nformally acknowledged the City's liberties. A special fund was raised for\r\nthe purpose of defending the City's rights.(530) From the 5th March to the\r\n17th March the justices sat, and then an adjournment was made until the\r\n16th April. On resumption of the session another adjournment immediately\r\ntook place owing to parliament sitting at Westminster, and when the judges\r\nshould have again sat, the Iter was suddenly determined by order of the\r\nking.(531) The king showed much annoyance at the attitude taken up by the\r\ncitizens, or at least by a certain portion of them, with respect to this\r\nenquiry, and endeavoured to procure the names of the ringleaders.(532)\r\nFailing in this, and not wishing to make an enemy of the city on which he\r\nlargely depended for resources to carry out his military measures, he\r\nbestowed a general pardon on the citizens, and promised that no Iter\r\nshould be held at the Tower for a period of seven years.(533)\r\n\r\n(M301)\r\n\r\nAs a further mark of favour he granted to the City, soon after the abrupt\r\ntermination of the Iter, a charter confirming previous charters; allowing\r\nthe citizens in express terms to vary customs that might in course of time\r\nhave become incapable of being put into practice, and declaring the city's\r\nliberties not subject to forfeiture through non-user.(534)\r\n\r\n(M302)\r\n\r\nIn August (1341) the citizens met to consider the question of levying a\r\nsum of L2,000, of which 2,000 marks was due to certain citizens in part\r\npayment of the L5,000 lent to the king, and 1,000 marks was required for\r\nthe discharge of the city's own debts. A certain number of aldermen and\r\ncommoners were at the same time appointed to confer with the king's\r\ncouncil touching the sending of ships of war beyond the seas. The result\r\nof the interview was made known to the citizens at a meeting held later on\r\nin the same month. A further grievous burden (_vehemens onus_) was to be\r\nlaid upon them; they were called upon to provide no less than twenty-six\r\nships, fully equipped and victualled at their own cost.(535)\r\n\r\n(M303)\r\n\r\nThe ships were probably wanted for conveying forces over to Brittany under\r\nthe command of Sir Walter de Maunay, in the following year. The king\r\nhimself made an expedition to that country in October, 1342, having\r\npreviously succeeded in borrowing the sum of L1,000 from the citizens. He\r\nhad asked for L2,000, but was fain to be content with the lesser sum,\r\nsecurity for repayment of which was demanded and granted.(536)\r\n\r\n(M304)\r\n\r\nIn March, 1343, Edward returned to England, having made a truce with\r\nFrance for three years.(537) He was beginning to learn the value of the\r\nEnglish longbow and the cloth-yard shaft in the field of battle. Hitherto\r\nhe, like others before him, had placed too much reliance on charges by\r\nknights on horseback. What the longbow could effect, under proper\r\nmanagement, had been experienced at Falkirk in 1298. It had proved a\r\nfailure at Bannockburn in 1314 through bad strategy, but at Halidon Hill\r\ntwenty years later (1333) it was again effective. It was destined soon to\r\nwork a complete reform in English warfare; and the yeoman and archer were\r\nto supersede the noble and knight. The London burgess and apprentice were\r\nespecially apt with the weapon from constant practice in Finsbury fields.\r\nEdward realised the necessity of fostering the martial spirit of the\r\nLondoners, and on one occasion (January, 1344) invited the wives of the\r\nburgesses to witness a tournament at Windsor, where they were entertained\r\nright royally.(538)\r\n\r\n(M305)\r\n\r\nBefore the expiration of the truce Edward was busy with preparations for a\r\nrenewal of the war. Four hundred London archers were to be got ready by\r\nMidsummer of 1344, as the king was soon to cross the sea; and 100\r\nmen-at-arms and 200 horsemen were to be despatched to Portsmouth.(539) In\r\n1345, a royal commission was issued for the seizure for the king's use of\r\nall vessels lying in the river.(540) A further contingent of 160 archers\r\nwas ordered to Sandwich by Whitsuntide, and in August the city received\r\nanother order for yet more archers.(541) In September, the king informed\r\nthe mayor by letter that, owing to the defective state of his fleet and\r\nthe prevalence of contrary winds, he had postponed setting sail for a\r\nshort time; the civic authorities were to keep their men-at-arms and\r\narchers ready to set out the morrow after the receipt of orders to\r\nmarch.(542) Six months elapsed, during which the citizens were kept under\r\narms waiting for orders, when, on the 18th March, 1346, another letter was\r\nsent by the king to the effect that he had now fully made up his mind to\r\nset sail from Portsmouth a fortnight after Easter. The men-at-arms, the\r\nhorsemen, and the archers, were to be ready by a certain day on pain of\r\nlosing life, limb, and property. On the 28th March, the archers mustered\r\nin \"Totehull\" or Tothill Fields, near Westminster.(543)\r\n\r\n(M306)\r\n\r\nThe expedition did not actually sail from Portsmouth until the 10th July,\r\nthe fleet numbering 1,000 vessels more or less.(544) Previous to his\r\ndeparture, Edward caused proclamation to be made in the city and\r\nelsewhere, to the effect that the assessments that had been made\r\nthroughout the country for the purpose of equipping the expedition, should\r\nnot be drawn into precedent.(545)\r\n\r\n(M307)\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd August the regent forwarded to the city a copy of a letter he\r\nhad received from the king, giving an account of his passage to Normandy\r\nand of the capture of various towns, and among them of Caen. There he had\r\ndiscovered a document of no little importance.  This was none other than\r\nan agreement made in 1338, whereby Normandy had bound itself to assist the\r\nking of France in his proposed invasion and conquest of England.(546) This\r\ndocument the king transmitted to England by the hands of the Earl of\r\nHuntingdon, who was returning invalided, and it was publicly read in St.\r\nPaul's Churchyard, with the view of stirring the citizens to fresh\r\nexertions in prosecuting the war. The king's own letter was also publicly\r\nread in the Husting by the regent's order.(547) The City was exhorted to\r\nhave in readiness a force to succour the king, if need be. Every effort\r\nwas made to raise money, and the regent did not hesitate to resort to\r\ndepreciation of the coinage of the realm in order to help his father. The\r\nCity made a free gift to the king of 1,000 marks and lent him 2,000\r\nmore.(548)\r\n\r\n(M308)\r\n\r\nOn the 26th August the battle of Crecy was won against a force far\r\noutnumbering the English army. The victory was due in large measure to the\r\nsuperiority of the English longbow over the crossbow used by the Genoese\r\nmercenaries; but it was also a victory of foot soldiers over horsemen. The\r\nfield of Bannockburn had shown how easy a thing it was for a body of\r\nhorsemen to crush a body of archers, if allowed to take them in the flank,\r\nwhilst that of Halidon Hill had more recently taught the king, from\r\npersonal experience, that archers could turn the tide of battle against\r\nany direct attack, however violent. Edward profited by the experience of\r\nthat day. He not only protected the flank of his archers, but interspersed\r\namong them dismounted horsemen with levelled spears, the result being that\r\nthe French were driven off the field with terrible slaughter.\r\n\r\n(M309)\r\n\r\nFlushed with victory Edward proceeded to lay siege to Calais. His forces,\r\nwhich had been already greatly reduced on the field of Crecy, suffered a\r\nfurther diminution by desertion. The mayor and sheriffs of London were\r\nordered to seize all deserters, whether knights, esquires, or men of lower\r\norder, found in the city, and to take steps for furnishing the king with\r\nfresh recruits and store of victuals.(549) By Easter of the following\r\nyear, the City was called upon to furnish two vessels towards a fleet of\r\n120 large ships, which the council had decided to fit out. All ships found\r\nin the port of London were pressed into the king's service.(550)\r\n\r\nIn July (1347) the king was in need of more recruits and provisions.(551)\r\nCalais still held out, although both besiegers and besieged were reduced\r\nto sore straits. At last it surrendered (4 Aug.). Edward spared the lives\r\nof its principal burgesses at the intercession of his queen, but he\r\ncleared the town of French inhabitants, and invited Londoners and others\r\nto take up their abode there, offering them houses at low rents and other\r\ninducements.(552) A truce with Philip was agreed on, and Edward returned\r\nhome. For a time England was resplendent with the spoils of the French\r\nwar--\"A new sun seemed to shine,\" wrote Walsingham.(553) Every woman of\r\nposition went gaily decked with some portion of the plunder of the town of\r\nCaen or Calais; cupboards shone with silver plate, and wardrobes were\r\nfilled with foreign furs and rich drapery of continental workmanship. The\r\ngolden era was of short duration.\r\n\r\n(M310)\r\n\r\nIn August, 1348, the pestilential scourge, known as the Black Death,(554)\r\nappeared in England, and reached London in the following November. The\r\nnumber of victims it carried off in the city has been variously\r\ncomputed,(555) but all conjectures of the kind must be received with\r\ncaution. All that is known for certain is that the mortality caused a\r\nmarked increase in the number of beggars, and, at the same time, raised\r\nthe price of labour and provisions within the city's walls to such a\r\ndegree that measures had to be taken to remedy both evils.(556) Besides\r\nthe losses by death, the population of the city and the country generally\r\nwas sensibly diminished by the flight of numbers of inhabitants to the\r\ncontinent, with the hope of escaping the ravages of the plague. The king's\r\ntreasury threatened soon to become empty, and the country left\r\ndefenceless, if this were allowed to go on unchecked; he therefore ordered\r\nthe sheriffs of London to see that no men-at-arms, strangers or otherwise,\r\nleft the kingdom, with the exception of well-known merchants or\r\nambassadors, without the king's special order.(557) Pilgrimages to Rome or\r\nelsewhere were made an excuse for leaving England, at a time when the\r\nking's subjects could ill be spared. The king endeavoured to limit this\r\ndrain upon the population of the kingdom by allowing none to cross the sea\r\nwithout his special licence. The city authorities having negligently\r\nexecuted his orders in this respect, received a rebuke in October, 1350,\r\nand were told to be more strict in their observance for the future.(558)\r\n\r\n(M311)\r\n\r\nOn the night which ushered in New Year's day, 1350, an abortive attempt\r\nhad been made by the French to recapture Calais. This ill success rendered\r\nPhilip the more willing to agree to a further prolongation of the truce\r\nwith England. Notification of this cessation of hostilities was duly sent\r\nto the sheriffs of London.(559) Before the truce had come to an end Philip\r\nof Valois had ceased to live, and had been succeeded on the throne of\r\nFrance by John II.\r\n\r\n(M312)\r\n\r\nThe city had scarcely recovered from the ravages of the late pestilence,\r\nbefore it was called upon (24 July, 1350) to furnish two ships to assist\r\nthe king in putting down piracy. These were accordingly fitted out; the\r\nship of Andrew Turk being furnished with 40 men-at-arms and 60 archers,\r\nwhilst that of Goscelin de Cleve had on board 30 men-at-arms and 40\r\narchers.(560) With their aid, Edward succeeded in utterly defeating a\r\nSpanish fleet which had recently inflicted much damage on the Bordeaux\r\nwine fleet, and capturing 24 large ships laden with rich merchandise.(561)\r\nThe citizens had further to submit to a tax on wool and wine, in order to\r\nmaintain the king's vessels engaged in putting down piracy.(562)\r\n\r\n(M313)\r\n\r\nIn 1354 an exception was made by special charter of the king in favour of\r\nthe City of London, and its sergeants were permitted to carry maces of\r\ngold or silver, or plated with silver, and bearing the royal arms. Ten\r\nyears before the commons of England had petitioned the king (_inter alia_)\r\nnot to allow any one to carry maces tipped with silver in city or borough,\r\nexcept the king's own officers. All others were to carry maces tipped with\r\ncopper only (_virolez de cuevere_), with staves of wood as formerly. The\r\npetition was granted saving that the sergeants of the City of London might\r\ncarry their mace within the liberties of the city and before the mayor in\r\nthe king's presence.(563) This same year (1354), moreover, the king with\r\nthe assent of parliament had again forbidden the carrying of gold or\r\nsilver maces. Thenceforth, maces were to be of iron, brass or tin, or\r\nstaves tipped with latten, and not to bear representations of the royal\r\narms, but the arms or signs of the city using them. Again exception was\r\nmade in the case of London; two sergeants of the City as well as of the\r\nCity of York being permitted to carry gold or silver maces, but they were\r\nnot to be surmounted with the royal arms. This led to a humble\r\nremonstrance from the whole body of the citizens of London, presented to\r\nthe chancellor and the council by their mayor, Adam Fraunceys, and within\r\na month the charter above mentioned was granted. That the charter\r\noriginated or authorized the title of \"Lord\" Mayor, as some have supposed,\r\nis extremely improbable.\r\n\r\n(M314)\r\n\r\nIn 1355, all efforts to convert the truce into a final peace having\r\nfailed, war with France was renewed. Edward was soon called home by fresh\r\ntroubles in Scotland. Having recovered Berwick, which had been taken by\r\nsurprise, and formally received the crown of Scotland from Edward Baliol,\r\nhe prepared to rejoin his son, the Black Prince, in France, and in March,\r\n1356, ordered the city to furnish him with two vessels of war.(564)\r\n\r\n(M315)\r\n\r\nNews of the battle of Poitiers (19 September, 1356), and of the defeat and\r\ncapture of the French king, was received in the city by letter from the\r\nPrince of Wales, dated 22nd October.(565) Again the English longbow,\r\ncombined with superior tactics, gained the day. The prince, on his return,\r\nmade a triumphal entry into the city, passing over London Bridge on his\r\nway to Westminster, with the captive king and the king's son in his\r\ntrain.(566) The streets were almost impassable for the multitude that\r\nthronged them; and for the moment the citizens forgot at what cost to\r\nthemselves the victory had been gained. A truce--a welcome truce--for two\r\nyears followed.(567)\r\n\r\n(M316)\r\n\r\nOnly a few weeks before the prince's return the citizens had laid before\r\nthe king a list of their grievances and prayed for redress.(568) They had\r\ncomplained of being charged taxes and talliages in excess of any other of\r\nthe commons. They had lent the king at Dordrecht no less a sum than\r\nL60,000, and had incurred further loss by the discrepancy between the\r\nweight for weighing wool at Dordrecht and that of England. They had lent\r\nthe king further sums of L5,000 and L2,000 on two separate occasions,\r\nwhich had not been repaid. The sum of L40,000 had been advanced to the\r\nking's merchants at Calais and elsewhere, and this, together with other\r\nsums lent (amounting to over L30,000), was still outstanding to the\r\ngrievous hurt of many citizens. They had, moreover, been called upon to\r\nundergo more charges than others with respect to the king's expeditions to\r\nScotland, Flanders and France, and in providing men-at-arms, archers and\r\nships, in aid of his wars. Nor did their complaints stop here. The king's\r\npurveyors had been accustomed to seize the carriages, victuals and\r\nmerchandise of citizens without offering payment for the same, in direct\r\ncontravention of the king's first charter to the city. Owing, moreover, to\r\ndeaths by the plague, so much property had come into mortmain that the\r\ncity had become impoverished, and one-third part of it rendered void of\r\ninhabitants. These points they had desired the king to consider, inasmuch\r\nas the city had always been loyal and peaceful, setting an example to the\r\nwhole country. The petition wound up with the usual complaint against the\r\nprivileges allowed foreign merchants, and a request that the king would\r\ngrant them letters patent under the great seal, such as they might show to\r\nthe purveyors whenever they attempted to take anything without\r\npayment.(569)\r\n\r\n(M317)\r\n\r\nAfter the expiration of the truce Edward again set out for France. That\r\ncountry, however, had suffered so much during the last two years at the\r\nhands of freebooters, that Edward experienced the greatest difficulty in\r\nfinding sufficient provisions for his army. Whilst he was traversing\r\nFrance in search of a force with which to try conclusions in the field, a\r\nNorman fleet swept down upon the south coast and sacked Winchelsea. The\r\nnews of this disaster so incensed the king that he determined to march\r\ndirect on Paris. The Londoners, in the meantime, assisted in fitting out a\r\nfleet of eighty vessels, manned with 14,000 men, including archers, in\r\norder to wipe out this disgrace, but the enemy contrived to make good\r\ntheir escape.(570)\r\n\r\n(M318)\r\n\r\nAt length Edward was induced to accede to the terms offered by France, and\r\nthe peace of Bretigny was concluded (8th May, 1360). The terms were very\r\nfavourable to England, although Edward consented to abandon all claim to\r\nthe French crown. King John was to be ransomed, but the price set on his\r\nrelease was so high that some years elapsed before the money could be\r\nraised, and then only with the assistance of a few of the livery companies\r\nof the city, which showed their sympathy with the captured king by\r\ncontributing to the fund being raised for the purpose of restoring him to\r\nliberty.(571) It was John's high sense of honour that kept him in\r\ncaptivity in England until his death in 1364. He had in fact been\r\nliberated and allowed to return to France soon after the conclusion of\r\npeace, on payment of part of his ransom, hostages being accepted for\r\npayment of the remainder. In 1363 one of the hostages broke his pledge and\r\nfled, and John, shocked at such perfidy, returned Regulus-like to England.\r\nHence it was that he appears as one of the four kings whom Picard, the\r\nmayor, entertained that same year at a banquet, followed by play at dice\r\nand hazard.(572)\r\n\r\n(M319)\r\n\r\nThe citizens now enjoyed a period of leisure which they were not slow to\r\nturn to account. The years which followed the peace of Bretigny, until war\r\nbroke out afresh in 1369, witnessed the re-organisation of many of the\r\ntrade and craft guilds. Some of these, like the Goldsmiths, the Tailors or\r\nLinen-Armourers, and the Skinners, had already obtained charters from\r\nEdward soon after his accession, so had also the Fishmongers, although the\r\nearliest extant charter of the company is dated 1363. The Vintners date\r\ntheir chartered rights from the same year; the Drapers from 1364; whilst\r\nthe more ancient company of Weavers obtained a confirmation of their\r\nprivileges in 1365. Minor guilds, like the Founders, the Plumbers, the\r\nFullers and others, had to content themselves with the recognition of\r\ntheir ordinances by the civic authorities alone between 1364 and 1369.\r\n\r\nThe king's favour was purchased in 1363 by a gift of nearly L500, to which\r\nthe livery companies largely contributed.(573) The amount of each\r\nsubscription varied from half-a-mark to L40, the latter sum being\r\ncontributed by the Mercers, the Fishmongers, the Drapers, and the Skinners\r\nrespectively. The Tailors subscribed half that amount, being outdone by\r\nthe Vintners, who contributed L33 6_s._ 8_d._\r\n\r\n(M320)\r\n\r\nWith the renewal of the war, a change comes over the pages of the City's\r\nannals. The London bachelor and apprentice is drawn off from his football\r\nand hockey, with which he had beguiled his leisure hours, and bidden to\r\ndevote himself to the more useful pursuits of shooting with arrow or bolt\r\non high days and holidays.(574) Once more we meet with schedules of\r\nmen-at-arms and archers provided by the City for service abroad, and of\r\nassessments made on the City's wards to pay for them.(575) Every\r\ninducement in the shape of plunder was held out to volunteers for\r\nenlistment, and public proclamation was made to the effect that the spoils\r\nof France should belong to the captors themselves.(576)\r\n\r\n(M321)\r\n\r\nIt was an easier matter for the City to provide the king with money than\r\nmen. In 1370 it advanced a sum of L5,000,(577) and in the following year a\r\nfurther sum of L4,000, and more was subscribed by the wealthier citizens,\r\namong whom were William Walworth, who contributed over L200, Adam\r\nFraunceys, Simon de Mordon, and others.(578)\r\n\r\n(M322)\r\n\r\nStill the expenses of the war exceeded the supply of money, and resort was\r\nhad to a new form of taxation, by which it was hoped that a sum of L50,000\r\nmight be realised. By order of parliament, made in March, 1371, the sum of\r\n22_s._ 3_d._ was to be levied on every parish in the kingdom, the number\r\nof parishes being reckoned as amounting to 40,000. It soon became apparent\r\nthat the number of existing parishes throughout the country had been\r\ngrossly miscalculated. There were not more than 9,000, and the amount of\r\nassessment had to be proportionately raised. It was necessary to summon a\r\ncouncil at Westminster in June, to remedy the miscalculation that had been\r\nmade in March. Half of the representatives of the late parliament were\r\nsummoned to meet the king, and among them two of the city's members,\r\nBartholomew Frestlyng and John Philipot--\"the first Englishman who has left\r\nbehind him the reputation of a financier.\"(579) The mistake was rectified,\r\nthe charge of 22_s._ 3_d._ was raised to 116_s._ and the city was called\r\nupon to raise over L600.(580)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the civic authorities had, in answer to the king's\r\nwrit,(581) prepared a return of the number of parish churches, chapels and\r\nprebends within the city.(582) It was found that within the city and\r\nsuburbs there were 106 parish churches(583) and thirty prebends, but only\r\ntwo of the latter were within the liberties. There was also the free\r\nchapel of St. Martin's-le-Grand, which embraced eleven prebends, all\r\nwithin the liberty of the city, and there were, moreover, two other\r\nchapels within the liberty. Besides these (the return stated) there were\r\nnone other.\r\n\r\n(M323)\r\n\r\nThe bare fact that there existed over 100 parishes, each with its parish\r\nchurch, within so small an area as that covered by the city and its\r\nsuburbs, is of itself sufficient to remind us that, besides having a\r\nmunicipal and commercial history, the city also possesses an\r\necclesiastical. The church of St. Paul, the largest foundation in the\r\ncity, with its resident canons exercising magnificent hospitality, was a\r\ncentre to which London looked as a mother, although it was not strictly\r\nspeaking the metropolitan cathedral. That title properly applies to the\r\nMinster at Canterbury; but the church of Canterbury being in the hands of\r\na monastic chapter left St. Paul's at the head of the secular clergy of\r\nsouthern England.(584) Besides the hundred and more churches there were\r\nmonastic establishments and colleges which covered a good fourth part of\r\nthe whole city. The collegiate church of St. Martin's-le-Grand almost\r\nrivalled its neighbour the cathedral church itself in the area of its\r\nprecinct. The houses of the Black Friars and Grey Friars in the west were\r\nonly equalled by those belonging to the Augustine and Crossed Friars\r\ntowards the east; while the Priory of St. Bartholomew found a counterpart\r\nin the Priory of Holy Trinity. The church was everywhere and ruled\r\neverything, and its influence manifests itself nowhere more strongly than\r\nin the number of ecclesiastical topics which fill the pages of early\r\nchronicles in connection with London.(585)\r\n\r\n(M324)\r\n\r\nThe war brought little credit or advantage in return for outlay. In\r\nJanuary, 1371, the Black Prince had returned to England with the glory of\r\nformer achievements sullied by his massacre at Limoges, and the City of\r\nLondon had made him a present of valuable plate.(586) The conduct of the\r\nwar was transferred to his eldest surviving brother, John of Gaunt, Duke\r\nof Lancaster. In 1372 the king himself set out with the flower of the\r\nEnglish nobility, and accompanied by a band of London archers and crossbow\r\nmen.(587) The expedition, which had for its object the relief of Rochelle,\r\nand which is said to have cost no less than L900,000, proved disastrous,\r\nand Edward returned after a brief absence.(588) In 1373 the city furnished\r\nhim with a transport barge called \"The Paul of London.\" The barge when it\r\nleft London for Southampton was fully supplied with rigging and tackle;\r\nnevertheless, on its arrival at the latter port, it was found to be so\r\ndeficient in equipment that it could not proceed to sea. The only\r\nexplanation that the master of the barge could give of the matter was that\r\na certain number of anchors and cables had been lost on the voyage. The\r\nCity paid twenty marks to make up the defects.(589) The year was marked by\r\na campaign under Lancaster which ended in the utmost disaster. The French\r\navoided a general action; the English soldiers deserted, and as the winter\r\ncame on the troops perished from cold, hunger and disease. By 1374 the\r\nFrench had recovered nearly all of their former possessions. England was\r\ntired of the war and of the ceaseless expenditure it involved. It was with\r\nno little joy that the Londoners heard, in July, 1375,(590) that peace had\r\nbeen concluded.\r\n\r\n(M325)\r\n\r\nIn April, 1376, a parliament met, known as the Good Parliament,(591) and\r\nbefore granting supply it demanded an account of former receipts and\r\nexpenditure. No less than three city aldermen were charged with\r\nmalversation. Richard Lyons, of Broad Street ward, was convicted with Lord\r\nLatimer of embezzling the king's revenue, and sentenced to imprisonment\r\nand forfeiture of goods.(592) Adam de Bury, of Langbourn ward, who had\r\ntwice served the office of mayor, was charged with appropriating money\r\nsubscribed for the ransom of the French king and fled to Flanders to avoid\r\ntrial;(593) whilst John Pecche of Walbrook ward was convicted of an\r\nextortionate exercise of a monopoly of sweet wines and his patent\r\nannulled. All three aldermen were deposed from their aldermanries by order\r\nof an assembly of citizens composed of representatives from the various\r\nguilds and not from the wards.(594)\r\n\r\n(M326)\r\n\r\nThe guilds, indeed, were now claiming a more direct participation in the\r\ngovernment of the city than they had hitherto enjoyed, and their claim had\r\ngiven rise to so much commotion that the king himself threatened to\r\ninterpose.(595) The threat was not liked, and the citizens hastened to\r\nassure him that no disturbance had occurred in the city beyond what\r\nproceeded from reasonable debate on an open question, and that to prevent\r\nthe noise and tumult arising from large assemblies, they had unanimously\r\ndecided that in future the Common Council should be chosen from the guilds\r\nand not otherwise.(596) This reply was sent to the king by the hands of\r\ntwo aldermen--William Walworth and Nicholas Brembre--and six commoners, and\r\nthe following day (2 August) the king sent another letter accepting the\r\nexplanation that had been offered, and expressing a hope that the city\r\nwould be so governed as not to require his personal intervention.(597)\r\n\r\nNot only was the common council to be selected in future by the guilds,\r\nbut the guilds were also to elect the mayor and the sheriffs.  The\r\naldermen and the commons were to meet together at least once a\r\nquarter,(598) and no member of the common council was to serve on\r\ninquests, nor be appointed collector or assessor of a talliage. This last\r\nprovision may have been due to the recent discoveries of malversation,\r\nbut, however that may be, it was found to work so well that it was more\r\nthan once re-enacted.(599) These changes in the internal administration of\r\nthe city were avowedly made by virtue of Edward's charter, which\r\nspecifically gave the citizens a right to remedy hard or defective\r\ncustoms.(600)\r\n\r\n(M327)\r\n\r\nThe power of the guilds in the matter of elections to the common council\r\nwas not of long duration. Before ten years had elapsed representation was\r\nmade that the new system had been forced on the citizens, and in 1384 it\r\nwas resolved to revert to the old system of election by and from the\r\nwards.(601)\r\n\r\n(M328)\r\n\r\nEncouraged by the success which had so far attended their efforts of\r\nreform, the good parliament next attacked Alice Perers, the king's\r\nmistress. Of humble origin, and not even possessing the quality of good\r\nlooks, this lady, for whom the mediaeval chroniclers have scarcely a good\r\nword to say,(602) nevertheless gained so complete a mastery over the king\r\nas to favour the popular belief that she indulged in magic. At length her\r\nbarefaced interference in public affairs led to an award against her of\r\nbanishment and forfeiture. Upon the dissolution of the good parliament (6\r\nJuly, 1376), and the meeting of a new parliament, elected under the direct\r\ninfluence of the Earl of Lancaster, who once more gained the upper hand\r\nnow that the Black Prince was dead, Alice Perers was allowed to\r\nreturn.(603) She was again in disgrace soon after Richard's accession,\r\nwhen her property, much of which consisted of real estate in the\r\nCity,(604) became escheated, and the citizens of London were promised\r\nredress for any harm she might have done them.(605) She was afterwards\r\nmarried to Sir William de Windsor, who, in 1376, had got himself into\r\ntrouble over a disturbance in Whitefriars(606)--a quarter of the city\r\nwhich, under the name of Alsatia, became afterwards notorious for riots,\r\nand as the resort of bad characters. Towards the close of 1379 her\r\nsentence of banishment, never strictly enforced, was revoked and pardon\r\nextended to her and her husband.(607)\r\n\r\n(M329)\r\n\r\nIn December, 1376, the citizens obtained a charter from the king, with the\r\nassent of parliament, granting that no strangers (_i.e._ non-freemen)\r\nshould thenceforth be allowed to sell by retail within the city and\r\nsuburbs. This had always been considered a grievance, ever since free\r\ntrade had been granted to merchant strangers by the parliament held at\r\nYork in 1335.\r\n\r\n(M330)\r\n\r\nThe last year of Edward's reign was one of serious opposition between the\r\nCity and the selfish and unprincipled Lancaster. In so far as the duke,\r\nwith the assistance of Wycliffe, meditated a reform among the higher\r\nclergy, he might, if he would, have had the city with him. The citizens,\r\nlike the great reformer himself, were opposed to the practice of the\r\nclergy heaping up riches and intermeddling with political matters. The\r\nduke, however, went out of his way to hurt the feelings of the citizens,\r\nby proposing to abolish the mayoralty and otherwise encroach upon their\r\nliberties.(608) Not content with this he took the occasion when Wycliffe\r\nwas summoned to appear at St. Paul's (19 Feb., 1377), to offer violence to\r\nCourtenay, their bishop. This so incensed the citizens that the meeting\r\nbroke up in confusion. The next day the mob, now thoroughly roused,\r\nhastened to the Savoy where the duke resided. He happened, however, to be\r\ndining in the city at the time, with a certain John de Ypre. The company\r\nhad scarcely sat down to their oysters before a soldier knocked at the\r\ndoor and warned them of the danger. They forthwith jumped up from the\r\ntable, the duke barking his shins (we are told) in so doing, and, making\r\ntheir way to the riverside, took boat for Kennington, where the duke\r\nsought protection in the house of the Princess of Wales. Thanks to the\r\nintervention of the bishop, who appeared on the scene, the mob did but\r\nlittle serious harm, beyond ill-using a priest and some of the duke's\r\nretainers whom they happened to come across.(609)\r\n\r\n(M331)\r\n\r\nThe civic authorities were naturally anxious as to what the king might say\r\nand do in consequence of the outbreak, and desired an interview in order\r\nto explain matters. Lancaster was opposed to any such interview taking\r\nplace. The London mob had seized upon an escutcheon of the duke, displayed\r\nin some public thoroughfare, and had reversed it by way of signifying that\r\nit was the escutcheon of a traitor.(610) This had particularly raised his\r\nanger. Nevertheless, in spite of his efforts to prevent it, an interview\r\nwas accorded to a deputation from the city, of which John Philipot acted\r\nas spokesman. After drawing the king's attention to the threatened attack\r\non the privileges of the city, and the proposed substitution of a\r\n\"captain\" for a mayor, Philipot offered an apology for the late riot. It\r\nhad taken place, he said, without the cognisance of the civic authorities.\r\nAmong a large population there were sure to be some bad characters whom it\r\nwas difficult to restrain, even by the authority of the mayor, when once\r\nexcited. A mob acted after the manner of a tornado, flying hither and\r\nthither, bent on committing havoc at anybody's expense, even its own, but,\r\nthank God! the duke had suffered no harm nor had any of his retinue been\r\nhurt. The king having listened to the deputation, assured them in reply,\r\nthat so far from wishing to lessen the privileges of the city, he had a\r\nmind to enlarge them. They were not to alarm themselves, but to go home\r\nand endeavour to preserve peace. On leaving the presence the deputation\r\nmet the duke, with whom they interchanged courtesies.(611) In the\r\nmeanwhile lampoons on the duke were posted in the city. The duke became\r\nfurious and demanded the excommunication of the authors. The bishops\r\nhesitated through fear of the mob, but at last the Bishop of Bangor was\r\ninduced by representations made to him by leading citizens, who wished it\r\nto be known that they did not approve of such libels, to execute the\r\nduke's wishes.(612)\r\n\r\n(M332)\r\n\r\nThe duke was determined to have his revenge, and again the citizens were\r\nsummoned to appear before the king, who was lying at Shene. This time they\r\ndid not get off so easily. The mayor, Adam Stable, was removed, and\r\nNicholas Brembre appointed in his place. A fresh election of aldermen took\r\nplace,(613) and the City did penance for the recent insult to the duke's\r\nescutcheon by offering, at the king's confidential suggestion, a wax taper\r\nbearing the duke's arms in St. Paul's. Even that did not satisfy him; nay,\r\nit was adding insult to injury (he said), for such an act was an honour\r\nusually paid to one who was dead! The citizens were in despair, and\r\ndoubted if anything would satisfy him, short of proclaiming him king.(614)\r\n\r\n(M333)\r\n\r\nOne of the last acts of Edward was to restore the Bishop of Winchester to\r\nthe temporalities of which he had been deprived by the duke, and this\r\nrestitution was made at the instance and by the influence of Alice\r\nPerers,(615) who within a few weeks robbed her dying paramour of his\r\nfinger rings and fled.(616)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(M334)\r\n\r\nShortly after Edward had breathed his last, a deputation from the City\r\nwaited upon the Prince of Wales at Kennington. John Philipot again acted\r\nas spokesman, and after alluding to the loss which the country had\r\nrecently sustained, and recommending the City of London--the \"king's\r\nchamber\"--to the prince's favour, begged him to assist in effecting a\r\nreconciliation with Lancaster. This Richard promised to do, and a few days\r\nlater the deputation again waited on the young king--this time at Shene,\r\nwhere preparations were being made for the late king's obsequies--and a\r\nreconciliation took place, the king kissing each member of the deputation,\r\nand promising to be their friend, and to look after the City's interests\r\nas if they were his own.(617) Formal announcement of the reconciliation\r\nwas afterwards made at Westminster, and Peter de la Mare, long a prisoner\r\nin Nottingham Castle, was set free, to the great joy of the citizens.(618)\r\n\r\n(M335)\r\n\r\nAt the express wish of the citizens, Richard--the \"Londoners' king,\" as the\r\nnobles were in the habit of cynically styling the new sovereign, for the\r\nreason that he had ascended the throne more by the assistance of the\r\n_bourgeois_ Londoner than of the nobility(619)--took up his quarters at the\r\nTower, whence he proceeded in state to Westminster for his coronation.\r\nGreat preparations were made in the city to tender his progress through\r\nthe streets one of exceptional splendour. The claim of the mayor and\r\ncitizens to assist the chief butler at the banquet was discourteously\r\nrefused by Robert Belknap, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, who bluntly\r\ntold them that they might be of service in washing up the pots and pans.\r\nThe citizens had their revenge, however. They set up an effigy of the man\r\nat a conspicuous arch or tower in Cheapside, in which he appeared to the\r\nwhole of the procession as it passed on its way to Westminster, in the\r\nignominious attitude of vomiting wine.(620) This was enough; the Londoners\r\ngained the day, and were allowed to perform their customary services at\r\nthe banquet, and the mayor got his gold cup.(621)\r\n\r\n(M336)\r\n\r\nRichard was only eleven years of age when raised to the throne. A council\r\nwas therefore appointed to govern in his name. Neither the Duke of\r\nLancaster nor any other of the king's uncles were elected councillors,\r\nand, for a time, John of Gaunt retired into comparative privacy. The task\r\nof the council was not easy. The French plundered the coast,(622) and the\r\nScots plundered the borders. Money was sorely needed. The City consented\r\nto advance the sum of L5,000 upon the security of the customs of the Port\r\nof London and of certain plate and jewels,(623) and when parliament met\r\n(13 Oct., 1377) it made a liberal grant of two tenths and two fifteenths,\r\nwhich was to be collected without delay, on the understanding that two\r\ntreasurers should be appointed to superintend the due application of the\r\nmoney.(624) The two treasurers appointed for this purpose were two\r\ncitizens of note, namely, William Walworth and John Philipot, of whose\r\nfinancial capability mention has already been made.\r\n\r\n(M337)\r\n\r\nBefore parliament broke up it gave its assent to a new charter to the\r\nCity.(625) Foreigners (_i.e._ non-freemen) were again forbidden to traffic\r\nin the city among themselves by retail, and the City's franchises were\r\nconfirmed and enlarged. So much importance was attached to this charter\r\nthat Brembre, the mayor, caused its main provisions to be published\r\nthroughout the city.(626)\r\n\r\n(M338)\r\n\r\nLancaster soon became tired of playing a subordinate part in the\r\ngovernment of the kingdom. As a preliminary step to higher aims, he\r\ncontrived, after some little opposition, to obtain the removal of the\r\nsubsidy granted by the last parliament, out of the hands of Walworth and\r\nPhilipot into his own, although these men had given no cause for suspicion\r\nof dishonourable conduct in the execution of their public trust.(627)\r\n\r\n(M339)\r\n\r\nThe energetic John Philipot soon found other work to do. The English coast\r\nhad recently become infested with a band of pirates, who, having already\r\nmade a successful descent upon Scarborough, were now seeking fresh\r\nadventures. Philipot fitted out a fleet at his own expense, and putting to\r\nsea succeeded in capturing the ringleader,(628) a feat which rendered him\r\nso popular as to excite the jealousy of the Duke of Lancaster and other\r\nnobles. His fellow citizens showed their appreciation of his character by\r\nelecting him to succeed Brembre in the mayoralty in October (1378).(629)\r\n\r\n(M340)\r\n\r\nThe citizens were, however, split up into factions, one party, with\r\nPhilipot and Brembre at his head, maintaining a stubborn opposition to\r\nLancaster, whilst another, under the leadership of Walworth and John de\r\nNorthampton, favoured the duke. These factions were continually plotting\r\nand counter-plotting one against the other. At Gloucester, to which the\r\nduke had brought the parliament in 1378, in the hope of escaping from the\r\ninterference of the \"ribald\" Londoners,(630) Brembre was arraigned on a\r\ncharge of having connived during his recent mayoralty at an attack made on\r\nthe house of the duke's younger brother, Thomas of Woodstock, Earl of\r\nBuckingham, and although he succeeded in proving his innocence, the earl\r\nand his party continued to use threats, and Brembre, in order to smooth\r\nmatters over, consented to be mulcted in 100 marks. When the matter was\r\nreported to the Common Council at home (25 Nov.), that body not only\r\nsignified its approval of his conduct--\"knowing for certain that it was for\r\nno demerits of his own, but for the preservation of the liberties of the\r\ncity, and for the extreme love which he bore it, that he had undergone\r\nsuch labours and expenses,\"--but recouped him what he had disbursed.(631)\r\n\r\n(M341)\r\n\r\nIn course of time the earl and his followers succeeded in persecuting\r\nBrembre to a disgraceful death. At present they contented themselves with\r\ndamaging the trade of the city, so far as they could, by leaving the city\r\n_en masse_ and withdrawing their custom. The result was so disastrous to\r\nthe citizens, more especially to the hostel keepers and victuallers, that\r\nthe civic authorities resolved to win the nobles back to the city by\r\nwholesale bribery, and, as the city's \"chamber\" was empty, a subscription\r\nlist was set on foot to raise a fund for the purpose. Philipot, the mayor,\r\nheaded the list with L10, a sum just double that of any other subscriber.\r\nSix others, among them being Brembre (the earl's particular enemy) and\r\nWalworth, subscribed respectively L5; whilst the rest contributed sums\r\nvarying from L4 down to five marks, the last mentioned sum being\r\nsubscribed by Richard \"Whytyngdon\" of famous memory.(632)\r\n\r\n(M342)\r\n\r\nThe grants made to the king by the parliament at Gloucester were soon\r\nexhausted by the war, and recourse was had, as usual, to the City. In\r\nFebruary, 1379, the mayor and aldermen were sent for to Westminster. They\r\nwere told that the king's necessities demanded an immediate supply of\r\nmoney, and that the Duke of Lancaster and the rest of the nobility had\r\nconsented to contribute. What would the City do? After a brief\r\nconsultation apart, the mayor and aldermen suggested that the usual course\r\nshould be followed and that they should be allowed to consult the general\r\nbody of the citizens in the Guildhall. Eventually the City consented to\r\nadvance another sum of L5,000 on the same security as before, but any tax\r\nimposed by parliament at its next session was to be taken as a set\r\noff.(633)\r\n\r\n(M343)\r\n\r\nAt the session of parliament held in April and May (1379), the demand for\r\nfurther supply became so urgent that a poll-tax was imposed on a graduated\r\nscale according to a man's dignity, ranging from ten marks or L6 1_s._\r\n4_d._ imposed on a duke, to a groat or four pence which the poorest\r\npeasant was called upon to pay. The mayor of London, assessed as an earl,\r\nwas to pay L4; and the aldermen, assessed as barons, L2. The sum thus\r\nfurnished by the city amounted to less than L700,(634) and the whole\r\namount levied on the country did not exceed L22,000, a sum far short of\r\nwhat had been anticipated.\r\n\r\n(M344)\r\n\r\nIn the following year (1380) there was a recurrence to the old method of\r\nraising money, but this proving still insufficient a poll-tax was again\r\nresorted to. This time, the smallest sum exacted was not less than three\r\ngroats, and was payable on everyman, woman and unmarried child, above the\r\nage of fifteen, throughout the country. The amount thus raised in the city\r\nand liberties was just over L1000.(635) The tax was especially irritating\r\nfrom its inquisitorial character, and led to serious consequences.\r\n\r\n(M345)\r\n\r\nThe country was already suffering under a general discontent, when a\r\ncertain Wat Tyler in Kent struck down a collector of the poll-tax, who\r\nattempted in an indecent manner to discover his daughter's age. This was\r\nthe signal for a revolt of the peasants from one end of England to the\r\nother, not only against payment of this particular tax, but against taxes\r\nand landlords generally. The men of Essex joined forces with those of Kent\r\non Blackheath, and thence marched on London. With the aid of sympathisers\r\nwithin the City's gates, the effected an entrance on the night of the 12th\r\nof June, and made free with the wine cellars of the wealthier class. The\r\nnext day, the rebels, more mad than drunk (_non tam ebrii quam dementes_),\r\nstirred up the populace to make a raid upon the Duke of Lancaster's palace\r\nof the Savoy. This they sacked and burnt to the ground. They next vented\r\ntheir wrath upon the Temple, and afterwards upon the house of the Knight's\r\nHospitallers at Clerkenwell. In the meantime reinforcements were gathering\r\nin Essex under the leadership of one known as \"Jack Straw,\" and were\r\nhurrying to London. At Mile End they were met (14 June) by the young king\r\nhimself, who set out from the Tower for that purpose, accompanied by a\r\nretinue of knights and esquires on horseback, as well as by his mother in\r\na drawn vehicle. The rebels demanded the surrender of all traitors to the\r\nking. To this Richard gave his assent, and having done so returned to the\r\ncity to take up his quarters at the Wardrobe, near Castle Baynard, whilst\r\nthe rebels, availing themselves of the king's word, hurried off to the\r\nTower. There they found Simon of Sudbury, Archbishop of Canterbury, and he\r\nand others were beheaded on Tower Hill. The rest of the day and the whole\r\nof the next were given up to plunder and massacre, so that the narrow\r\nstreets were choked with corpses. Among those who perished at the hands of\r\nthe rebels was Richard Lyons, the deposed alderman. At length, on the\r\nevening of Saturday, the 15th, when the king had ridden to Smithfield\r\naccompanied by Walworth, the mayor, and a large retinue in order to\r\ndiscuss matters with Wat Tyler (the Essex men had for the most part\r\nreturned home), an altercation happened to arise between Tyler and one of\r\nthe royal suite. Words were about to lead to blows when the mayor himself\r\ninterposed, and summarily executed the king's order to arrest Tyler by\r\nbringing him to the ground by a fatal blow of his dagger. Deprived of\r\ntheir leader the mob became furious, and demanded Walworth's head; the\r\nmayor, however, contrived to slip back into the City, whence he quickly\r\nreturned with such a force that the rioters were surrounded and compelled\r\nto submit. The king intervened to prevent further bloodshed, and knighted\r\non the field not only Walworth, but also Nicholas Brembre, John Philipot\r\nand Robert Launde.(636) The same day a royal commission was issued to\r\nenquire into the late riot and to bring the offenders to account.(637)\r\n\r\n(M346)\r\n\r\nOrders were given on the 20th June to each alderman to provide men-at-arms\r\nand archers to guard in turns the city's gates, and to see that no armed\r\nperson entered the city, except those who declared on oath that they were\r\nabout to join the king's expedition against the rebels. In the meantime,\r\nthe aldermen were to make returns of all who kept hostels in their several\r\nwards.(638) In a list, containing nearly 200 names of divers persons of\r\nbad character, who had left the city by reason of the insurrection,(639)\r\nthere appear the names of two servants of Henry \"Grenecobbe.\" The name is\r\nfar from common, and we shall not perhaps be far wrong in conjecturing\r\nthat the owner of it was a relation of William \"Gryndecobbe,\" who led the\r\ninsurgents against the abbey of St. Albans and compelled the abbot to\r\nsurrender its charter.(640)\r\n\r\n(M347)\r\n\r\n\"Jack Straw,\" on being brought before the mayor, was induced by promises\r\nof masses for the good of his soul, to confess the nature of the\r\nintentions of the rioters, which were to use the king's person as a\r\nstalking horse for drawing people to their side, and eventually to kill\r\nhim and all in authority throughout the kingdom. The mendicant friars, who\r\nwere believed to be at the bottom of the insurrection,(641) were alone to\r\nbe spared. Wat Tyler was to be made king of Kent, whilst others were to be\r\nplaced in similar positions over the rest of the counties. The mayor\r\nsentenced him to be beheaded. This done, his head was set up on London\r\nBridge, where Wat Tyler's already figured.(642)\r\n\r\n(M348)\r\n\r\nThe discontent which had given rise to the peasants' revolt, had been\r\nfanned by the attacks made by Wycliffe's \"simple priests\" upon the rich\r\nand idle clergy. The revolt occasioned a bitter feeling among the landlord\r\nclass against Wycliffe and his followers, and after its suppression the\r\nLollards were made the object of much animadversion. Their preaching was\r\nforbidden,(643) and Wycliffe was obliged to retire to his country\r\nparsonage, where he continued to labour with his pen for the cause he had\r\nso much at heart, until his death in 1384.\r\n\r\n(M349)\r\n\r\nThe majority of the citizens favoured the doctrines of Wycliffe and his\r\nfollowers and endeavoured to carry them out. The Duke of Lancaster had no\r\nreal sympathy with the Lollards; he only wished to make use of them for a\r\npolitical purpose. It was otherwise with the Londoners, and with John de\r\nNorthampton, a supporter of the duke, who succeeded to the mayoralty soon\r\nafter the suppression of the revolt. Under Northampton--a man whom even his\r\nenemies allowed to be of stern purpose, not truckling to those above him,\r\nnor bending to his inferiors,(644)--many reforms were carried out,\r\necclesiastical as well as civil.\r\n\r\nThe ecclesiastical courts having grossly failed in their duty, the\r\ncitizens themselves, fearful of God's vengeance if matters were allowed to\r\ncontinue as they were, undertook the work of reform within the city's\r\nwalls. The fees of the city parsons were cut down. The fee for baptism was\r\nnot to exceed forty pence, whilst that for marriage was not as a general\r\nrule to be more than half a mark. One farthing was all that could be\r\ndemanded for a mass for the dead, and the priest was bound to give change\r\nfor a half-penny when requested or forego his fee.(645) Steps were taken\r\nat the same time to improve the morality of the city by ridding the\r\nstreets of lewd women and licentious men. On the occasion of a first\r\noffence, culprits of either sex were subjected to the ignominy of having\r\ntheir hair cropt for future identification, and then conducted with rough\r\nmusic through the public thoroughfares, the men to the pillory and the\r\nwomen to the \"thewe.\" After a third conviction, they were made to abjure\r\nthe City altogether.(646) It was during Northampton's first year of the\r\nmayoralty that the citizens succeeded in breaking down the monopoly of the\r\nfree fish-mongers. A number of \"dossers\" or baskets for carrying fish were\r\nalso seized because they were deficient in holding capacity, and on that\r\naccount were calculated to defraud the purchaser.(647)  But, although a\r\nmayor in those days exercised, no doubt, greater power in the municipal\r\ngovernment than now, we must be careful to avoid the common mistake of\r\nattributing to the individuality of the mayor for the time being what was\r\nreally the action of the citizens as a body corporate.\r\n\r\n(M350)\r\n\r\nIn October, 1382, Northampton was elected mayor for the second time, and\r\nPhilipot, his rival, either resigned or was deprived of his\r\naldermancy.(648) His re-election was at the king's express wish. On the\r\n6th he wrote to the sheriffs, aldermen and commons of the city intimating\r\nthat, whilst anxious to leave the citizens free choice in the matter of\r\nelection of their mayor, he would be personally gratified if their choice\r\nfell upon the outgoing mayor. At first Northampton declined re-election,\r\nbut he afterwards consented to serve another year on receiving a written\r\nrequest from the king.(649) His hesitation was probably due to the\r\nfactious state of the city. Brembre and Philipot were not his only\r\nenemies. Another alderman, Nicholas Exton, of Queenhithe Ward, had\r\nrecently been removed from his aldermancy for opprobrious words used to\r\nNorthampton during his first mayoralty. A petition had been laid before\r\nthe Court of Common Council in August, 1382, when Exton himself being\r\npresent, and seeing the turn affairs were taking, endeavoured to\r\nanticipate the judgment of the court, by himself asking to be exonerated\r\nfrom his office, declaring at the same time that he had offered a large\r\nsum of money to be released at his election in the first instance. The\r\ncourt wishing for further time to consider the matter adjourned. At its\r\nnext meeting a similar petition was again presented, but the court\r\nhesitated to pronounce judgment in the absence of Exton, who was summoned\r\nto appear at the next Common Council. When the court met again, it was\r\nfound that Exton had ignored the summons. Judgment was, therefore,\r\npronounced in his absence and he was deprived of his aldermancy.(650)\r\n\r\n(M351)\r\n\r\nAt the close of Northampton's second mayoralty (Oct., 1383), his place was\r\ntaken by his rival, Nicholas Brembre,(651) and a general reversal of the\r\norder of things took place. The free-fishmongers recovered their ancient\r\nprivileges,(652) and the judgment passed upon Exton as well as a similar\r\njudgment passed upon another alderman, Adam Carlile, were reversed.(653)\r\n\r\n(M352)\r\n\r\nSoon after Brembre's election the king confirmed the City's liberties by\r\ncharter,(654) which had the assent of parliament. Two years previously the\r\ncitizens had besought the newly-married queen to use her interest with\r\nRichard to that end.(655) Her good offices, as well as the fact that the\r\nCity had recently advanced to the king the sum of 4,000 marks, on the\r\nsecurity of the royal crown and other things,(656) may have been\r\ninstrumental in obtaining for the citizens this fresh confirmation of\r\ntheir rights.\r\n\r\n(M353)\r\n\r\nIn January (1384) Northampton was bound over to keep the peace in the sum\r\nof L5,000;(657) but in the following month he was put under arrest\r\n(together with his brother, known as Robert \"Cumberton,\" and another), for\r\nraising a disturbance in the City, and sent to Corfe Castle.(658) For\r\nNorthampton's arrest, as well as for the summary execution of a certain\r\nJohn Constantyn, a cordwainer, who had been convicted of taking a leading\r\npart in the disturbance, Brembre received a letter of indemnity from the\r\nking.(659) The riot had one good effect. It roused public opinion against\r\nmonopolies and restriction of trade to such an extent, that Richard very\r\nsoon afterwards caused the city to be opened freely to all foreigners\r\n_(i.e._, non-freemen) wishing to sell fish or other victuals.(660)\r\n\r\n(M354)\r\n\r\nIn August (1384) the opinion of each individual member of the Common\r\nCouncil was taken on oath, as to whether it would be to the advantage or\r\ndisadvantage of the city if Northampton were allowed to return; and it was\r\nunanimously found that his return would breed dissension rather than peace\r\nand unity.(661) Armed with this _plebiscite_ the mayor and a number of\r\ncitizens, whom the king had summoned by name, attended a council at\r\nReading for the purpose of determining the fate of Northampton. The\r\naccused contented himself with objecting to sentence being passed against\r\nhim in the absence of his patron the Duke of Lancaster. This, however,\r\navailed him nothing, and he was sentenced to perpetual imprisonment in\r\nTintagel Castle.(662) Another authority(663) states that the mayor brought\r\nwith him to the council a man named Thomas Husk or Usk (whose name, by the\r\nway, does not appear in the list which the king forwarded to the mayor),\r\nwho made a number of charges against Northampton. The prisoner so far\r\nforgot himself in the royal presence as to call Usk a liar, and to\r\nchallenge him to a duel. Matters were not improved by Northampton's appeal\r\nfor delay in passing sentence upon him in the absence of the Duke of\r\nLancaster. Richard flushed crimson with anger at the proposal, declaring\r\nthat he was ready to sit in judgment upon the duke no less than on\r\nNorthampton, and forthwith ordered the latter's execution, and the\r\nconfiscation of his goods. The sentence would have been earned out but for\r\nthe timely intercession of the queen, who flung herself at her husband's\r\nfeet and begged for the prisoner's life. The queen's prayer was granted,\r\nand Northampton was condemned to perpetual imprisonment and remitted to\r\nCorfe Castle. Thence, at the beginning of September, he was removed to the\r\nTower of London, where two of his partisans, John More, one of the\r\nsheriffs, and Richard Northbury, recently arrested, were lodged.\r\n\r\n(M355)\r\n\r\nThe Chief Justice, Tressilian, hesitated to take any steps against the\r\nprisoners, one of whom had already been tried and sentenced, asserting\r\nthat the matter lay within the jurisdiction of the mayor. His scruples,\r\nhowever, on this score were easily set aside, and on the 10th September,\r\neach of the prisoners was sentenced to be drawn and hanged. No sooner was\r\nsentence passed than the chancellor, Michael de la Pole, entered on the\r\nscene, and proclaimed that the king's grace had been extended to the\r\nprisoners, that there lives would be spared, but that they would be\r\nimprisoned until further favour should be shown them. They were\r\naccordingly sent off to various fortresses; Northampton to Tintagel Castle\r\nin Cornwall, Northbury to Corfe Castle, and More to Nottingham; and all\r\nthis arose, says the Chronicler, from the rivalry of fishmongers.(664)\r\n\r\n(M356)\r\n\r\nWhen Brembre sought re-election to the mayoralty in October, 1384, he\r\nfound a formidable competitor in Nicholas Twyford, with whom he had not\r\nalways been on the best of terms. It was in 1378, when Twyford was sheriff\r\nand Brembre was occupying the mayoralty chair for the first time, that\r\nthey fell out, the occasion being one of those trade disputes so frequent\r\nin the City's annals. A number of goldsmiths and pepperers had come to\r\nloggerheads in St. Paul's Churchyard during sermon time, and the mayor had\r\ncommitted one of the ringleaders to the compter. The culprit, however,\r\nhappened to be, like Twyford, a goldsmith, and was one of his suite.\r\nTwyford resented his man being sent to prison, and for his pains got\r\narrested himself.(665) It was felt that the election would be hotly\r\ncontested and might lead to disturbance. Besides the customary precept\r\nissued by the mayor forbidding any to appear who were not specially\r\nsummoned,(666) the king took the precaution of sending John de Nevill, of\r\nRoby, to the Guildhall to see that the election was properly conducted. In\r\nspite of all precautions, however, a disturbance took place, and some of\r\nthe rioters were afterwards bound over to keep the peace.(667) It is said\r\nthat Brembre himself secreted a body of men in the neighbourhood of the\r\nGuildhall, and that when he found the election going against him, he\r\nsignalled for them, and Twyford's supporters were compelled to flee for\r\nsafety, and that thus the election was won.(668) Nothing of this appears\r\nin the City's Records, where Brembre's re-election is entered in the\r\nmanner of the day.(669)\r\n\r\n(M357)\r\n\r\nIn 1385 Brembre was again elected mayor, and continued in office until\r\nOctober, 1386, when he was succeeded by his friend and ally, Nicholas\r\nExton. This was the fourth and last time Brembre was mayor. In the\r\nmeantime, the Duke of Lancaster and his party had renewed their efforts to\r\neffect the release of Northampton and of his fellow prisoners, More and\r\nNorthbury, on the understanding that they were not to come near the City,\r\nand Brembre again took the opinion of the aldermen and commons severally\r\nas to the probable effect of the release of the prisoners. This occurred\r\nin March, 1386, when it was unanimously resolved that danger would result\r\nto the city if Northampton was allowed to come within 100 miles of\r\nit.(670) The resolution caused much annoyance to the duke, who\r\ncharacterised it as unreasonable and outrageous, and led to some heated\r\ncorrespondence.(671) It had, however, the desired effect of at least\r\npostponing the release of the prisoners.(672)\r\n\r\n(M358)\r\n\r\nA few months after Exton had taken Brembre's place as mayor (Oct., 1386),\r\nthe new mayor raised a commotion by ordering a book called \"Jubilee,\"\r\nwhich Northampton is supposed to have compiled--or caused to be compiled\r\nfor the better government of the City, to be publicly burnt in Guildhall\r\nyard.(673) The cordwainers of London, staunch supporters of Northampton\r\n(the leader of the riot which led to Northampton's arrest in 1384 was a\r\ncordwainer), complained to parliament of Exton. The book, said they, \"\r\ncomprised all the good articles pertaining to the good government of the\r\nCity,\" which Exton and all the aldermen had sworn to maintain for ever,\r\nand now he and his accomplices had burnt it without consent of the\r\ncommons, to the annihilation of many good liberties, franchises, and\r\ncustoms of the City.(674) The book had already been subjected to revision\r\nin June, 1384, when Brembre was mayor;(675) it was now utterly destroyed.\r\n\r\n(M359)\r\n\r\nIn 1387 efforts were again made to secure Northampton's release, and this\r\ntime with success. On the 17th April Exton reported to the Common Council\r\nthat Lord Zouche was actually engaged in canvassing the king for the\r\nrelease of Northampton and his allies. The Council thereupon unanimously\r\nresolved to send a letter to Lord Zouche, on behalf of the entire\r\ncommonalty of the City, praying him to desist from his suit, and assuring\r\nhim of their loyalty to the king even unto death.(676) It also resolved to\r\nsend a deputation on horseback to the king, who was at \"Esthamstede,\" to\r\nask his favour for the City, and to beg of him not to annul the charters\r\nwhich he had already given to the citizens, more especially as touching\r\nthe release of the prisoners in question.\r\n\r\n(M360)\r\n\r\nOn the 4th May the Recorder, William Cheyne, reported to the Common\r\nCouncil assembled in the upper chamber of the Guildhall the result of the\r\ninterview with the king. The deputation had been received most graciously,\r\nand the mayor had been particularly successful in his speech, setting\r\nforth the dangers that would inevitably ensue, both to the king and to the\r\ncity, if pardon were granted to Northampton and his friends. The king had\r\nreplied that he would take good precautions for himself before he granted\r\nthem their liberty;(677) and with this answer the citizens had to be\r\ncontent. The answer was an evasive one, if it be true, as one authority\r\nstates, that on the 27th April--the day on which the mayor had informed the\r\ncitizens of the intervention of Lord Zouche--Northampton had received his\r\npardon and been restored to his property.(678) His friends remained still\r\nunsatisfied, and plagued the king for more favourable terms to such a\r\ndegree that Richard ordered (7 Oct.) proclamation to be made in the city\r\nagainst any further entreaties being made to him on the subject.(679)\r\n\r\n(M361)\r\n\r\nTwo days before the order for this proclamation, the king was informed by\r\nletter of the nature of a fresh oath of allegiance(680) that had been\r\ntaken by the mayor, aldermen, and commonalty of the city. He was\r\nfurthermore exhorted to give credence to what Nicholas Brembre might\r\ninform him as to the state and government of the city, since there was no\r\none better informed than Brembre on the subject.\r\n\r\n(M362)\r\n\r\nTo this the king sent a gracious reply.(681) He had learnt with much\r\npleasure from Nicholas Brembre of the allegiance of the citizens, which he\r\ntrusted would continue, as he would soon have good reason for paying a\r\nvisit to the city in person. He had heard that the new sheriffs were good\r\nand trusty men, and he expressed a hope that at the approaching election\r\nof a mayor they would choose one of whom he could approve, otherwise he\r\nwould decline to receive the mayor-elect at his presentation. He not only\r\nforbade any further entreaties to be made to him touching Northampton,\r\nMore and Northbury, but commissioned enquiry to be made as to their\r\nproperty in the city. He was especially gratified to learn that, in\r\naccordance with his request, they had appointed Thomas Usk (the chief\r\nwitness against Northampton) to the office of under-sheriff, and promised\r\nthat such appointment should not be drawn into precedent. The citizens\r\nwere not slow to take the hint about the election of a new mayor, and\r\nExton was continued in office.(682)\r\n\r\n(M363)\r\n\r\nGreat discontent had arisen meanwhile in the country at the lavish\r\nexpenditure of the king, without any apparent result in victories abroad,\r\nsuch as had been gained in the glorious days of his predecessor. A cry for\r\nreform and retrenchment was raised, and found a champion in the person of\r\nthe Duke of Gloucester, the youngest of the king's uncles. At his\r\ninstigation, the parliament which assembled on the 1st October, 1386,\r\ndemanded the dismissal of the king's ministers, and read him a lesson on\r\nconstitutional government which ended in a threat of deposition unless the\r\nking should mend his ways. Richard was at the time only twenty-one years\r\nof age. In the impetuosity of his youth he is recorded as having\r\ncontemplated a dastardly attempt upon the life of his uncle, whom he had\r\ngrown to hate as the cause of all his difficulties. A plan was laid, which\r\nis said to have received Brembre's approbation, for beguiling the duke\r\ninto the city by an invitation to supper, and then and there making away\r\nwith him, but the duke was forewarned. The chronicler who records\r\nBrembre's complicity in this nefarious design against Gloucester's life\r\nalso relates that Exton, who was mayor, refused to have anything to do\r\nwith it.(683)\r\n\r\n(M364) (M365) (M366)\r\n\r\nBefore the end of the session, parliament had appointed a commission, with\r\nGloucester at its head, to regulate the government of the country and the\r\nking's household. This very naturally excited the wrath of the hot-headed\r\nking, who immediately set to work to form a party in opposition to the\r\nduke. In August of the next year (1387) he obtained a declaration from\r\nfive of the justices to the effect that the commission was illegal. On the\r\n28th October he sent the Archbishop of York and the Earl of Suffolk into\r\nthe city to learn whether he could depend upon the support of the\r\ncitizens. The answer could not have been regarded as unfavourable, for, on\r\nthe 10th November, the king paid a personal visit to the city and was\r\nreceived with great ceremony.(684) On the following day (11 Nov.) orders\r\nwere given to the aldermen of the City to assemble the men of their\r\nseveral wards, to see that they were suitably armed according to their\r\nrank and estate, and to make a return of the same in due course.(685)\r\n\r\n(M367)\r\n\r\nOn the 14th Gloucester formally charged the king's five counsellors--the\r\nArchbishop of York, the Duke of Ireland, the Earl of Suffolk, Chief\r\nJustice Tressilian and Nicholas Brembre, \"the false London knight,\" with\r\ntreason.(686) The king retaliated by causing proclamation to be made to\r\nthe effect that he had taken these same individuals under his own\r\nprotection, and that no one should harm them save at his own peril. This\r\nprotection was extended also to the king's uncle, the Duke of Gloucester,\r\nand the Earls of Arundel and Warwick, the impeaching parties.\r\n\r\n(M368)\r\n\r\nOn the 28th the mayor and aldermen were summoned to proceed to Windsor\r\nforthwith, to consult upon certain matters very weighty (_certeines\r\ntreschargeauntes matirs_).(687) The City's archives contain no record of\r\nwhat took place at the interview, but it appears that the object of the\r\nconference was to ascertain how many men-at-arms the city would be likely\r\nto furnish the king at a crisis. The answer given by the mayor was not\r\nencouraging; the citizens were merchants and craftsmen, and not soldiers,\r\nsave for the defence of the city itself; and the mayor straightway asked\r\nthe king's permission to resign his office.(688)\r\n\r\n(M369) (M370)\r\n\r\nFinding that he could not rely on any assistance from the Londoners--whom\r\nWalsingham describes as fickle as a reed, siding at one time with the\r\nlords and at another time with the king(689)--Richard was driven to\r\ntemporise. He had already promised that in the next parliament his\r\nunfortunate advisers should be called to account, but long before\r\nparliament met (3 Feb., 1388), four out of the five culprits had made good\r\ntheir escape--at least for a time. Brembre alone was taken.(690) He had\r\nanticipated the blow by making over all his property at home and abroad to\r\ncertain parties by deed, dated the 15th October, 1387, no doubt, upon a\r\nsecret trust.(691)\r\n\r\n(M371)\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the evident coolness of the citizens towards him, Richard\r\ndetermined to leave Windsor and spend Christmas at the Tower. He would be\r\nsafer there, and less subject to the dominating influence of the Duke of\r\nGloucester and the Earls of Arundel, Nottingham, Warwick and Derby, who\r\nobjected to his shaking off the fetters of the commission. As soon as his\r\nintention was known, these five lords--who, from having been associated in\r\nappealing against Richard's counsellors, were styled \"appellant\"--hastened\r\nto London, and drawing up their forces outside the city's walls, demanded\r\nadmittance. After some little hesitation, the mayor determined to admit\r\nthem, defending his action to the king by declaring that they were his\r\ntrue liege men and friends of the realm.(692)\r\n\r\n(M372)\r\n\r\nOn the 18th January, 1388, the lords appeared at the Guildhall,\r\naccompanied by the Archbishop, the Bishops of Ely, Hereford, Exeter, and\r\nothers. The Archbishop absolved the citizens of their oaths of allegiance,\r\nwhilst the Bishop of Ely, the lord treasurer, deprecated any remarks made\r\nto the disparagement of the lords. The lords and the bishops had been\r\nindicted on an iniquitous charge, and there were some among the citizens\r\nwho had been similarly indicted, but whether justly or unjustly he (the\r\nbishop) could not say. That would be decided by parliament. In the\r\nmeantime they were ready to assist in settling the trade disputes in the\r\ncity, for it was absurd for one body of the citizens to attempt to\r\nexterminate another. The citizens, however, showed no desire to accept the\r\nproffered mediation.(693)\r\n\r\n(M373)\r\n\r\nWhen parliament met (3 Feb.), a formidable indictment of thirty-nine\r\ncharges was laid against the king's late advisers, of whom Brembre alone\r\nappeared. On the 17th February, he was brought up by the constable of the\r\nTower, and was called on to answer off-hand the several charges of treason\r\nalleged against him. He prayed for time to take counsel's advice. This\r\nbeing refused, he claimed to support his cause by wager of battle, and\r\nimmediately the whole company of lords, knights, esquires, and commons,\r\nflung down their gages so thick, we are told, that they \"seemed like snow\r\non a winter's day.\"(694) But the lords declared that wager by battle did\r\nnot lie in such a case. When the trial was resumed on the following day,\r\nso much opposition arose between the king, who spoke strongly in Brembre's\r\nfavour, and the lords, that it was decided to leave the question of the\r\nprisoner's guilt or innocence to a commission of lords, who, to the\r\nsurprise and annoyance of the majority of the nobles, brought in a verdict\r\nof not guilty. Brembre was not to be allowed thus to escape. The lords\r\nsent for two representatives of the various crafts of the city to depose\r\nas to Brembre's guilt; but even so, the lords failed to get any definite\r\nverdict. At last they sent for the mayor, recorder, and some of the\r\naldermen (_seniores_) to learn what they had to say about the accused.\r\n\r\n(M374)\r\n\r\nOne would have thought that with Nicholas Exton, his old friend and ally,\r\nto speak up for him, Brembre's life would now at least be saved, even if\r\nhe were not altogether acquitted. It was not so, however. The mayor and\r\naldermen were asked as to their _opinion_ (not as to their knowledge),\r\nwhether Brembre was cognisant of certain matters, and they gave it as\r\ntheir _opinion_ that Brembre was more likely to have been cognisant of\r\nthem than not. Turning then to the Recorder, the lords asked him how stood\r\nthe law in such a case? To which he replied, that a man who knew such\r\nthings as were laid to Brembre's charge, and knowing them failed to reveal\r\nthem, deserved death. On such evidence as this, Brembre was convicted on\r\nthe 20th February, and condemned to be executed.(695) He was drawn on a\r\nhurdle through the city to Tyburn, showing himself very penitent and\r\nearnestly desiring all persons to pray for him. At the last moment he\r\nconfessed that his conduct towards Northampton had been vile and wicked.\r\nWhilst craving pardon of Northampton's son \"he was suddenly turned off,\r\nand the executioner cutting his throat, he died.\"(696)\r\n\r\n(M375)\r\n\r\nIf we are to believe all that Walsingham records of Brembre, the character\r\nand conduct of the city alderman and ex-mayor was bad indeed. Besides\r\nconniving at the plot laid against Gloucester's life, which involved the\r\ngrossest breach of hospitality, he is recorded as having lain in wait with\r\nan armed force at the Mews near Charing Cross, to intercept and massacre\r\nthe lords on their way to Westminster, to effect an arrangement with the\r\nking, as well as having entertained the idea of cutting the throats of a\r\nnumber of his fellow-citizens, and placing himself at the head of the\r\ngovernment of the city, the name of which he proposed changing to that of\r\n\"Little Troy.\"(697)\r\n\r\n(M376)\r\n\r\nOf Brembre's associates, Tressilian was captured during the trial, torn\r\nfrom the Sanctuary at Westminster, and hanged on the 19th. Another to\r\nshare the same fate was Thomas Uske, who had been one of the chief\r\nwitnesses against Northampton. He was sentenced to death by parliament on\r\nthe 4th March, and died asseverating to the last that he had done\r\nNorthampton no injury, but that every word he had deposed against him the\r\nyear before was absolutely true.(698)\r\n\r\n(M377)\r\n\r\nThe lords appellant, who were now complete masters of the situation,\r\ninsisted upon the proceedings of this \"merciless\" parliament, as its\r\nopponents called it, being ratified by oath administered to prelates,\r\nknights, and nobles of the realm, as well as to the mayor, aldermen, and\r\nchief burgesses of every town. On the 4th June--the day parliament rose--a\r\nwrit was issued in Richard's name, enjoining the administration of this\r\noath to those aldermen and citizens of London who had not been present in\r\nparliament when the oath was administered there.(699)\r\n\r\n(M378)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the continued jealousy existing among the city guilds--the\r\nMercers, Goldsmiths, Drapers, and others, objecting to Fishmongers and\r\nVintners taking any part in the government of the city on the ground that\r\nthey were victuallers, and as such forbidden by an ordinance passed when\r\nNorthampton was mayor to hold any municipal office(700)--had led parliament\r\n(14 May) to proclaim free trade throughout the kingdom.(701) A party in\r\nthe city tried to get parliament to remove Exton from the mayoralty on the\r\nground of his having connived at the curtailment of the City's liberties\r\nand franchises. The attempt, however, failed, and he remained in office\r\nuntil succeeded by Nicholas Twyford (Oct., 1388).(702) Although Twyford\r\nbelonged to the party of Northampton as distinguished from that of Brembre\r\nand Exton, his election raised little or no opposition, such as had been\r\nanticipated. When he went out of office in October, 1389, however, party\r\nstrife in the city again showed itself. The majority of the citizens voted\r\nWilliam Venour, a grocer, into the mayoralty, but the choice was strongly\r\nopposed by the Goldsmiths, the Mercers, and the Drapers, who ran another\r\ncandidate, one of their own body, Adam Bamme, a goldsmith.(703)\r\n\r\n(M379)\r\n\r\nSome months before the close of Twyford's mayoralty, Richard had succeeded\r\nin gaining his independence (May, 1389), which he was induced by\r\nLancaster, on his return after a prolonged absence abroad, to exercise at\r\nlength in favour of Northampton, by permitting him once more to return to\r\nLondon, although only as a stranger.(704) This was in July. In December,\r\nletters patent granting him a free pardon were issued, containing no such\r\nrestriction.(705) His re-appearance in the streets of the city revived the\r\nold party spirit, and Adam Bamme, who had succeeded Venour in the\r\nmayoralty, found it expedient to forbid all discussion of the rights and\r\nthe wrongs of the several parties of Northampton and Brembre on pain of\r\nimprisonment.(706) Four more years elapsed before Northampton was\r\nre-instated in the freedom of the city.(707)\r\n\r\n(M380)\r\n\r\nFor some years Richard governed not unwisely. In 1392, however, he\r\nquarrelled with the city. Early in that year he called upon every\r\ninhabitant, whose property for the last three years was worth L40 in land\r\nor rent, to take upon himself the honour of knighthood. The sheriffs,\r\nHenry Vanner and John Shadworth, made a return that all tenements and\r\nrents in the city were held of the king _in capite_ as fee burgage at a\r\nfee farm (_ad feodi firmam_); that by reason of the value of tenements\r\nvarying from time to time, and many of them requiring repair from damage\r\nby fire and tempest, their true annual value could not be ascertained, and\r\nthat, therefore, it was impossible to make a return of those who possessed\r\nL40 of land or rent as desired.(708)\r\n\r\n(M381)\r\n\r\nThis answer was anything but agreeable to the king. But he had other cause\r\njust now for being offended with the city. Being in want of money, he had\r\noffered a valuable jewel to the citizens as security for a loan, and the\r\ncitizens had excused themselves on the plea that they were not so well off\r\nas they used to be, since foreigners had been allowed to enjoy the same\r\nprivileges in the city as themselves. Having failed in this quarter, the\r\nking had resorted to a Lombard, who soon was able to accommodate him; but\r\nwhen the king learnt on enquiry that the money so obtained had been\r\nadvanced to the Lombard merchant by the very citizens who had refused to\r\nlend it to the king himself, his anger knew no bounds,(709) and he\r\nsummoned John Hende, the mayor, the sheriffs, the aldermen, and\r\ntwenty-four of the chief citizens(710) of the City to attend him in June,\r\nat Nottingham. They accordingly set out on their journey on the 19th June,\r\nand arrived in Nottingham on the 23rd; the government of the city being\r\nleft in the meanwhile in the hands of William Staundon. On the 25th they\r\nappeared before the lords of the council, when the chancellor rated them\r\nroundly for paying so little attention to the king's writ--the writ\r\ntouching knighthood--and complained of the defective manner in which the\r\ncity was governed.(711)\r\n\r\n(M382)\r\n\r\nHe thereupon dismissed the mayor from office, committing him to Windsor\r\nCastle. The sheriffs were likewise dismissed, one being sent to Odyham\r\nCastle, and the other to the Castle of Wallingford. The rest of the\r\ncitizens were ordered to return home.(712)\r\n\r\n(M383)\r\n\r\nAt nine o'clock in the morning of the 1st July, Sir Edward Dalyngrigge\r\nappeared in the Guildhall, and there, before an immense assembly of the\r\ncommons, read the king's commissions appointing him warden of the city and\r\nthe king's escheator. The deposed sheriffs were succeeded by Gilbert\r\nMaghfeld, or Maunfeld, and Thomas Newton, who remained in office, by the\r\nking's appointment,(713) until the end of the year, when they were\r\nre-elected, the one by the warden and the other by the citizens.(714)\r\nDalyngrigge was soon afterwards succeeded in the office of warden by Sir\r\nBaldwin de Radyngton.(715)\r\n\r\n(M384)\r\n\r\nBy way of inflicting further punishment upon the citizens, Richard had\r\nalready removed the King's Bench and Exchequer from London to York;(716)\r\nbut the removal proved so much more prejudicial to the nation at large\r\nthan to the City of London that the courts were soon brought back.(717) He\r\nwould even have waged open war on them had he dared.(718) Instead of\r\nproceeding to this extremity, he summoned the aldermen and 400 commoners\r\nto Windsor(719) and fined the City L100,000. This was in July (1392). In\r\nAugust the king notified his intention of passing through the city on his\r\nway from Shene to Westminster. The citizens embraced the opportunity of\r\ngiving him a magnificent reception, which the king acknowledged in the\r\nfollowing month by restoring to them their liberties and setting free\r\ntheir late mayor and sheriffs.(720) The fine of L100,000 recently imposed,\r\nas well as other moneys which the king considered to be due to him from\r\nthe city, were also remitted.(721)\r\n\r\n(M385)\r\n\r\nOnce more restored to their liberties, the citizens in the following year\r\n(1393), with the assent of parliament, effected a reform in the internal\r\ngovernment of the city which the increasing population had rendered\r\nnecessary. The Ward of Farringdon Within and Without had increased so much\r\nin wealth and population that it was deemed advisable to divide it into\r\ntwo parts, each part having its own alderman. Accordingly, in the\r\nfollowing March (1394), Drew Barantyn was elected Alderman of Farringdon\r\nWithin, whilst John Fraunceys was elected for Farringdon Without. A more\r\nimportant reform effected at the same time was the appointment of aldermen\r\nfor life instead of for a year only.(722)\r\n\r\n(M386)\r\n\r\nIn the following year (1394) the queen--Anne of Bohemia--died. She had\r\nalways shown a friendly disposition towards the city, and it was mainly\r\nowing to her intercession that Richard had restored its liberties.(723)\r\nHer death removed one good influence about Richard, and marks a change of\r\npolicy or of character.(724) His second marriage in 1396 did not improve\r\nmatters. In that year the mayor, Adam Bamme, died in office, and instead\r\nof allowing the citizens freely to elect a successor, he thrust upon them\r\nRichard Whitington.(725) He arrested the Duke of Gloucester and the Earls\r\nof Warwick and Arundel, and otherwise behaved so outrageously as to raise\r\ndoubts as to his sanity. He gave out that he was afraid to appear in\r\npublic for fear of the Londoners; but this was only a ruse for the purpose\r\nof raising money.(726) Like Edward II, he borrowed money from anybody and\r\neverybody, and often resorted to unconstitutional measures to fill his\r\npurse. He made the nobles and his wealthier subjects sign blank cheques\r\nfor him to fill up at his pleasure.(727) These cheques, or \"charters\" as\r\nthey were called, were afterwards burnt by order of his successor on the\r\nthrone.\r\n\r\n(M387)\r\n\r\nA crisis was fast approaching. The Duke of Hereford, whom the king had\r\nbanished, and who, on the death of his father \"time honoured Lancaster,\"\r\nsucceeded to the title early in 1399, was prevailed upon to return to\r\nEngland and strike a blow for the recovery of his inheritance which\r\nRichard had seized. Richard, as if infatuated, took this inopportune\r\nmoment to sail to Ireland. Before setting out he made a last bid for the\r\nfavour of the citizens by again granting them permission to rule the fish\r\ntrade according to ancient custom.(728) It was too late; they had already\r\nresolved to throw in their lot with Henry of Lancaster.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Henry had landed at Ravenspur (4th July) a special messenger\r\nwas despatched to the city with the news. The mayor was in bed, but he\r\nhurriedly rose and took steps to proclaim Henry's arrival in England. \"Let\r\nus apparel ourselves and go and receive the Duke of Lancaster, since we\r\nagreed to send for him,\" was the resolution of those to whom the mayor\r\nconveyed the first tidings; and accordingly Drew Barentyn, who had\r\nsucceeded Whitington in October, 1398, and 500 other citizens, took horse\r\nto meet the duke, whom they escorted to the city. The day that Henry\r\nentered the city was kept as a holiday, \"as though it had been the day for\r\nthe celebration of Easter.\"\r\n\r\n(M388)\r\n\r\nWhen Richard heard of Henry's landing he hurried back from Ireland. He was\r\nmet by the duke with a large force, which comprised 1,200 Londoners, fully\r\narmed and horsed.(729) Finding resistance hopeless, the king made\r\nsubmission, craving only that he might be protected from the Londoners,\r\nwho, he was convinced, bore him no good will. He was, in consequence,\r\nsecretly conveyed to the Tower under cover of night. Articles were drawn\r\nup accusing him of misgovernment, and publicly read in the Guildhall. Four\r\nof his advisers and supporters, whose names he gave up, hoping to gain\r\nfavour for himself thereby, were executed at a fishmonger's stall in\r\nCheapside. Sentence of deposition was passed against him, and Lancaster\r\nproclaimed king in his stead under the title of King Henry IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(M389)\r\n\r\nThe sentence passed on the late king proved his death warrant; his haughty\r\nspirit broke down, and he died at Pontefract the following year. According\r\nto Henry's account he died of wilful starvation. There were many, however,\r\nwho believed him to have been put to death by Henry's orders; whilst\r\nothers, on the contrary, refused to believe his death had actually taken\r\nplace at all, notwithstanding the fact of the corpse having been purposely\r\nexposed to public view throughout its journey from Pontefract to\r\nLondon.(730) This belief that Richard was still alive was fostered by\r\nmany, and, among others, by William Serle. He had been at one time the\r\nlate king's chamberlain, and he kept up the delusion of Richard being\r\nstill in the land of the living, by exhibiting the late king's signet,\r\nwhich had come into his possession. Serle was eventually arrested in the\r\nnorth of England and brought to London, to be executed at Tyburn.(731)\r\n\r\n(M390)\r\n\r\nSixteen years later (1416), a certain Thomas Warde, called \"Trumpyngtone,\"\r\npersonated the late king, and a scheme was laid for placing him on the\r\nthrone with the aid of Sigismund, king of the Romans Sigismund, however,\r\nrefused to have anything to do with the plot, which was hatched within the\r\ncity's liberties by Benedict Wolman and Thomas Bekering. The conspiracy\r\nhaving been discovered, its authors were thrown into prison. One died\r\nbefore trial, the other paid the penalty for his rashness with his\r\nhead.(732) In August, 1420, long after Trumpington was dead, two others,\r\nThomas Cobold and William Bryan, endeavoured still to keep up the delusion\r\nin the city. The mayor, Whitington, himself ordered their arrest. Bryan\r\nhad time to escape from the house of William Norton, a barber given to\r\nLollardry, where he and his fellow conspirator were lodged. Cobold tried\r\nto hide himself, but was discovered cunningly concealed in the house, and\r\ntaken before the mayor and aldermen. Being questioned as to the identity\r\nof Trumpington and the late king, he gave an evasive reply, adding, that\r\nthe question of identity had become immaterial since Trumpington had been\r\ndead some time. Cobold was thought to be too dangerous a man to be allowed\r\nat large, so he was committed to prison.(733)\r\n\r\n(M391)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Wycliffe had died (1384), and Lollardry had become only\r\nanother name for general discontentment. The clergy made strenuous efforts\r\nto suppress the Lollards. Pope Boniface had invoked the assistance of the\r\nlate king (1395) to destroy these \"tares\" (_lolium aridum_) that had\r\nsprung up amidst the wheat which remained constant to church and king, and\r\ncalled upon the mayor and commonalty of the city to use their interest\r\nwith Richard to the same end.(734) Besides seeking the support of the\r\ncommonalty against the powerful nobles, the new king sought the support of\r\nthe church, and he had not been long on the throne before he issued\r\ncommissions for search to be made in the city for Lollards, and for the\r\narrest of all preachers found sowing the pestilential seed of Lollardry\r\n(_semen pestiferum lollardrie_).(735) Early in 1401 a price was put upon\r\nthe head of the captain and leader of the sect, Sir John Oldcastle,\r\notherwise known as Lord Cobham. Public proclamation was made in the city,\r\nthat any one giving information which should lead to his arrest should be\r\nrewarded with 500 marks; any one actually arresting or causing him to be\r\narrested should receive double that amount, whilst the citizens and\r\nburgesses of any city or borough who should take and produce him before\r\nthe king, should be for ever quit of all taxes, talliages, tenths,\r\nfifteenths and other assessments.(736) Not only were conventicles\r\nforbidden, but no one was allowed to visit the ordinary churches after\r\nnine o'clock at night or before five o'clock in the morning.(737)\r\n\r\n(M392)\r\n\r\nStill the clergy were not satisfied. The ecclesiastical courts could\r\ncondemn men as heretics, but they had no power to burn them. Accordingly,\r\na statute was passed this year (1401), known as the statute of heresy (_de\r\nhaeretico comburendo_), authorising the ecclesiastical courts to hand over\r\nto the civil powers any heretic refusing to recant, or relapsing after\r\nrecantation, so that he might pay the penalty of being publicly burnt\r\nbefore the people.(738) It was the first English law passed for the\r\nsuppression of religious opinion, and its first victim is said to have\r\nbeen one William Sautre, formerly a parish priest of Norfolk.(739)\r\n\r\n(M393)\r\n\r\nHenry had other difficulties to face besides opposition from the nobles.\r\nFrance had refused to acknowledge his title to the crown, and demanded the\r\nrestoration of Richard's widow, a mere child of eleven. The Scots(740) and\r\nthe Welsh were on the point of engaging in open insurrection. Invasion was\r\nimminent; the exchequer was empty, and the Londoners appealed to could\r\noffer no more than a paltry loan of 4,000 marks.(741)\r\n\r\n(M394)\r\n\r\nAs time went on, Henry had to try new methods for raising money. The\r\nparliament which met at the opening of 1404, granted the king a 1_s._ in\r\nthe pound on all lands, tenements and rents, besides 20_s._ for every\r\nknight's fee. The money so raised was not, however, to be at the disposal\r\nof the king's own ministers, but was to be placed in the hands of four\r\nofficials to be known as treasurers of war (_Guerrarum Thesaurarii_). The\r\nnames of the treasurers elected for the purpose are given as John Owdeby,\r\nclerk, John Hadley, Thomas Knolles, and Richard Merlawe, citizens of\r\nLondon.(742) Three of these were citizens of note. Hadley had already\r\nserved as mayor in 1393, Knolles had filled the same office in 1399, and\r\nwas re-elected in 1410, whilst Merlawe was destined to attain that honour\r\nboth in 1409 and 1417.\r\n\r\n(M395)\r\n\r\nIt was during Merlawe's first mayoralty that the citizens advanced to the\r\nking the sum of 7,000 marks,(743) to enable him to complete the reduction\r\nof Wales, which his son, the Prince of Wales, had already nearly\r\naccomplished. In 1412 they advanced a further sum of 10,000 marks.(744) At\r\nthe beginning of that year a commission was addressed by Henry to Robert\r\nChichele, the mayor, brother of the archbishop of the same name, to the\r\nsheriffs of the city, to Richard Whitington and Thomas Knolles, the late\r\nmayor, instructing them to make a return of the amount of land and\r\ntenements held in the city and suburbs, with the view of levying 6_s._\r\n8_d._ on every L20 annual rent by virtue of an act passed by the late\r\nparliament.(745) A return was made to the effect that it was very\r\ndifficult to discover the true value of lands and tenements in the city\r\nand suburbs, owing to absence of tenants and dilapidations by fire and\r\nwater, but that they had caused enquiry to be made, and the names of men,\r\nwomen and other persons (_hominum, feminarum et aliarum personarum_)\r\nmentioned in the commission were forwarded by them in the following a, b,\r\nc (_in sequenti a, b, c_). What lands and tenements the \"men, women and\r\nother persons\" had elsewhere they had no means of discovering.(746) The\r\nschedule, or \"a, b, c,\" is not entered in the City Letter Book, but is to\r\nbe found among the Exchequer Rolls, preserved at Her Majesty's Public\r\nRecord(747) Office. The gross rental was returned at L4,220, and the sum\r\npaid into the exchequer at 6_s._ 8_d._ for every L20, under the provisions\r\nof the act amounted to L70 6_s._ 8_d._ The mayor and commonalty of the\r\ncity are credited as possessing lands, tenements and rents of an annual\r\nvalue of no more than L150 9_s._ 11_d._, whilst the Bridge House Estate\r\nwas returned at L148 15_s._ 3_d._ Of the livery companies, the Goldsmiths\r\nappear as the owners of the largest property, their rental of city\r\nproperty amounting to L46 10_s._ 1/2_d._, the Merchant Tailors following\r\nthem closely with L44 3_s._ 7_d._ The Mercers had but a rental of L13\r\n18_s._ 4_d._ whilst the Skinners had L18 12_s._ 8_d._ Robert Chichele, the\r\nmayor, was already a rich man, with an annual rental of L42 19_s._ 2_d._,\r\nderived from city property, or nearly double the amount (L25) with which\r\nRichard Whitington was credited.\r\n\r\n(M396)\r\n\r\nWhitington had already three times occupied the mayoralty chair; once (in\r\n1396) at the word of a king, and twice (in 1397 and 1406) at the will of\r\nhis fellow citizens. On the occasion of his third election a solemn mass\r\nwas for the first time introduced into the proceedings, the mayor,\r\naldermen and a large body of commoners attending the service at the\r\nGuildhall Chapel, before proceeding to the election.(748) The custom which\r\nthen sprang up continues in a modified form to this day, the election of a\r\nmayor being always preceded by divine service. Its origin may perhaps be\r\nascribed in some measure to the spirit of Lollardry which, in its best\r\nsense, found much favour with the citizens.\r\n\r\nThe enormous wealth which he succeeded in amassing was bestowed in\r\npromoting the cause of education, and in relieving the sufferings of the\r\npoor and afflicted. He built a handsome library in the house of the Grey\r\nFriars and also the Church of Saint Michael in the \"Riole.\" He is credited\r\nby some writers with having purchased and presented to the corporation the\r\nadvowson of the Church of St. Peter upon Cornhill. But this is probably a\r\nmistake arising from the fact of a license in mortmain having been granted\r\nby Henry IV to Richard Whitington, John Hende, and others, to convey the\r\nmanor of Leadenhall, together with the advowsons of the several churches\r\nof Saint Peter upon Cornhill and Saint Margaret Patyns, held of the king\r\nin free burgage, to the mayor and commonalty of the City of London and\r\ntheir successors.(749)\r\n\r\n(M397)\r\n\r\nOn the accession of Henry V, Archbishop Arundel, whom Walsingham describes\r\nas the most eminent bulwark and indomitable supporter of the church,(750)\r\nrenewed his attack on the Lollards, and endeavoured to serve Oldcastle\r\nwith a citation. Failing to accomplish this he caused him to be arrested.\r\nThe bold defence made by the so-called heretic, when before his judges,\r\ngained additional weight from the reputation he enjoyed for high moral\r\ncharacter. Nevertheless he was adjudged guilty of the charges brought\r\nagainst him. A formal sentence of excommunication was passed, and he was\r\nremitted to the Tower for forty days in the hope that at the expiration of\r\nthat time he might be found willing to retract. This, however, was not to\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n(M398)\r\n\r\nHe contrived to make his escape from prison,(751) and shortly afterwards\r\nappeared at the head of a number of followers in St. Giles's Fields. Great\r\ndisappointment was felt at not receiving the assistance that had been\r\nexpected from city servants and apprentices. According to Walsingham, no\r\nless than 5,000 men, comprising masters as well as servants, from the\r\ncity, were prepared to join the insurgents, had not the king taken\r\nprecautions to secure the gates. As soon as it was discovered that the\r\nyoung king had made ample preparations to meet attack, the Lollards took\r\nto flight. Many, however, failed to make good their escape, and nearly\r\nforty paid the penalty of their rashness with their lives.(752) Walsingham\r\nwas probably misinformed as to the number of the persons who were prepared\r\nto assist the Lollards. The fact is that, to the respectable City burgess,\r\nLollardism was a matter of less moment than was the scandalous life led by\r\nthe chantry priest and other ministers of religion, and this the civic\r\nauthorities were determined to rectify as far as in them lay. Between the\r\nyears 1400 and 1440, some sixty clerks in holy orders were taken in\r\nadultery and clapt into prison by ward beadles.(753) Nevertheless the\r\nclergy, and more especially the chantry priest, continued to live a life\r\nof luxury and sloth, oftentimes spending the day in dicing, card playing,\r\ncock fighting and frequenting taverns.\r\n\r\n(M399)\r\n\r\nThe recent abortive attempt of Oldcastle gave rise to another Statute\r\nagainst the Lollards,(754) by which the secular power, no longer content\r\nwith merely carrying into execution the sentences pronounced by\r\necclesiastical courts, undertook, where necessary, the initiative against\r\nheretics. Archbishop Arundel, the determined enemy of the Lollards, had\r\nhad no hand in framing this Statute--the last that was enacted against\r\nthem.(755) He had died a few months before parliament met, and had been\r\nsucceeded by Henry Chichele.\r\n\r\n(M400)\r\n\r\nEarly in the following year (1415) the king made an offer of pardon to\r\nOldcastle, who was still at large, if he would come in and make submission\r\nbefore Easter.(756) Instead of accepting so generous an offer, Oldcastle\r\nbusied himself in preparing for another rising to take place as soon as\r\nthe king should have set sail on his meditated expedition to France.\r\nLollard manifestoes again appeared on the doors of the London churches;\r\nwhilst Oldcastle himself scoured the country for recruits, to serve under\r\na banner on which the most sacred emblems of the church were\r\ndepicted.(757)\r\n\r\n(M401)\r\n\r\nIn August (1415) another Lollard, John Cleydone by name, a currier by\r\ntrade, was tried in St. Paul's Church before the new Archbishop and\r\nothers, the civic authorities having taken the initiative according to the\r\nprovisions of the recent Statute, and arrested him on suspicion of being a\r\nheretic. The mayor himself was a witness at the trial, and testified as to\r\nthe nature of certain books found in Cleydon's possession; they were \"the\r\nworst and the most perverse that ever he did read or see.\" Walsingham, who\r\nstyles Cleydon \"an inveterate Lollard\" (_quidam inveteratus Lollardus_),\r\nadds, with his usual acerbity against the entire sect, that the accused\r\nhad gone so far as to make his own son a priest, and have Mass celebrated\r\nby him in his own house on the occasion when his wife should have gone to\r\nchurch, after rising from childbed.(758) Having been convicted of heresy\r\nby the ecclesiastical court, the prisoner was again delivered over to the\r\nsecular authorities for punishment.(759) Both he and his books were\r\nburnt.(760)\r\n\r\n(M402)\r\n\r\nTwo years later Oldcastle himself was captured in Wales and brought to\r\nLondon. At his trial he publicly declared his belief that Richard II was\r\nstill alive; he was even fanatic enough to believe that he himself would\r\nsoon rise again from the dead.(761) He was sentenced to be hanged and\r\nburnt on the gallows, a sentence which was carried out in St. Giles's\r\nFields.(762) Lollardry continued to exist, especially in London and the\r\ntowns, for some years, but it ceased to have any historical or political\r\nsignificance.(763)\r\n\r\n(M403)\r\n\r\nHenry V was resolved to maintain not only the old religion of the days of\r\nEdward III, but also the old foreign policy, and in 1414 he commenced\r\nmaking preparations for renewing the claim of his great-grandfather to the\r\ncrown of France. In 1415 this claim was formally made, and Henry gathered\r\nhis forces together at Southampton. On the 10th March he informed the\r\ncivic authorities of his intention of crossing over to France to enforce\r\nhis claim and of his need of money. On the 14th a brilliant assembly,\r\ncomprising the king's two brothers, John, Duke of Bedford, and Humphrey,\r\nDuke of Gloucester, Edward, Duke of York, the Archbishop of Canterbury,\r\nthe Bishop of Winchester, and others, met at the Guildhall to consider the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n(M404)\r\n\r\nA question arose as to order of precedence, and it was arranged that the\r\nmayor, as the king's representative in the City, should occupy the centre\r\nseat, having the Primate and the Bishop of Winchester on his right, and\r\nthe Duke of York and the king's brothers on his left.(764) This question\r\nhaving been settled, the meeting, we presume, got to business; but what\r\ntook place is not recorded in the City's archives. We know, however, that\r\nin June the king pledged his jewels to the City for a loan of 10,000\r\nmarks,(765) and that on the 1st August--just as he was preparing to set\r\nsail--he raised a further loan of 10,000 marks on the security of the\r\ncustoms.(766)\r\n\r\n(M405)\r\n\r\nOn the 15th June the king, who was then on his way to the coast, took\r\nsolemn leave of the civic authorities, who had accompanied him to\r\nBlackheath. He bade them go home and keep well his \"chamber\" during his\r\nabsence abroad, giving them his blessing and saying \"Cryste save\r\nLondon.\"(767) Arriving at Southampton, he there discovered a conspiracy to\r\nplace the young Earl of March, the legitimate heir of Edward III, on the\r\nthrone, as soon as he himself should have set sail. The traitors were\r\nseized and executed, and the City lost no time in sending the king a\r\nletter congratulating him upon his discovery of the plot.(768)\r\n\r\n(M406)\r\n\r\nA few days later (12th August) he sailed for France and landed near\r\nHarfleur, to which town he laid siege. It offered, however, a stubborn\r\ndefence, and it was not until the 18th September that the town\r\nsurrendered. On the 22nd Henry sent a long account of the siege and\r\ncapture to the mayor and citizens of London, bidding them render humble\r\nthanks to Almighty God for this mercy, and expressing a hope of further\r\nsuccess in the near future.(769)\r\n\r\n(M407) (M408)\r\n\r\nEarly in October the king caused proclamation to be made in the City, that\r\nall and singular knights, esquires and valets who were willing to go with\r\nhim to Normandy, should present themselves to his uncle Henry, Bishop of\r\nWinchester and Treasurer of England, who would pay them their wages. By\r\nthe same proclamation merchants, victuallers and handicraft-men were\r\ninvited to take up their residence in the recently captured town of\r\nHarfleur, where houses would be assigned to them, and where they should\r\nenjoy the same privileges and franchises to which they had always been\r\naccustomed.(770)\r\n\r\n(M409) (M410)\r\n\r\nThe battle of Agincourt was fought on the 25th October, and news of the\r\njoyous victory arrived in England on or before the 28th, on which day--the\r\nFeast of St. Simon and St. Jude--Nicholas Wotton, the recently elected\r\nmayor, was sworn into office at the Guildhall according to custom. On the\r\nfollowing day, therefore, the mayor, aldermen and a large number of the\r\ncommonalty made a solemn pilgrimage on foot to Westminster, where they\r\nfirst made devout thanksgiving for the victory that had been won, and then\r\nproceeded to present the new mayor before the Barons of the Exchequer.\r\nCare is taken in the City records to explain that the procession went on\r\nthis occasion on foot, simply and solely for the purpose of marking their\r\nhumble thanks to the Almighty and his Saints, and more especially to\r\nEdward the Confessor, who lay interred at Westminster, for the joyful news\r\nwhich so unexpectedly had arrived. The journey on foot was not to be drawn\r\ninto precedent when others succeeded to the mayoralty, nor supplant the\r\nriding in state which had been customary on such occasions.(771) The\r\nreception given to the king by the Londoners on his return from France,\r\nwas of so brilliant and varied a character, that one chronicler declares\r\nthat a description of it would require a special treatise.(772) On the\r\n16th November he landed at Dover and proceeded towards London. On\r\nSaturday, the 23rd, the mayor and aldermen and all the companies rode\r\nforth in their liveries to meet the king and conduct him and his train of\r\nFrench prisoners through the City to Westminster. On Sunday morning a\r\ndeputation from the City waited upon Henry and presented him with the sum\r\nof L1,000 and two basons of gold worth half that sum.(773)\r\n\r\n(M411)\r\n\r\nDuring the next eighteen months succeeding the battle of Agincourt, Henry\r\ndevoted himself to making preparations at home for renewing active\r\nmilitary operations. He had intended at midsummer, 1416, to lead an\r\nexpedition in person to the relief of Harfleur, but the command was\r\nsubsequently delegated to his brother, the Duke of Bedford. Proclamation\r\nwas publicly made in the city by order of the king, dated the 28th May,\r\nthat all and singular knights, esquires and valets holding any fief or\r\nannuity from the king should proceed to Southampton by the 20th June,\r\narmed each according to his estate, for the purpose of joining the\r\nexpedition.(774) In 1417 France was rendered weak by factions, and Henry\r\nseized the opportunity for another attack. On the 1st February he issued\r\nhis writ to the sheriffs of London for a return to be made of the number\r\nof men-at-arms and archers the City knights could furnish.(775) In March\r\nthe mayor, Henry Barton, was made a commissioner for victualling the navy\r\nwhich was to rendezvous at Southampton.(776)\r\n\r\n(M412)\r\n\r\nIn the same month the City advanced the king the sum of 5,000 marks,(777)\r\nand in the following June a further sum was advanced by private\r\nsubscription among the wealthier citizens on the security of a Spanish\r\nsword, set in gold and precious stones, of the estimated value of L2,000.\r\nThe sword was pledged with the subscribers on the understanding that they\r\nwould not dispose of it before Michaelmas twelve-month.(778)\r\n\r\n(M413) (M414)\r\n\r\nOn the 9th August the king addressed a letter to the mayor, sheriffs,\r\naldermen and good folk of the City of London, informing them of his safe\r\narrival in Normandy and of his success in making himself master of the\r\ncastle of \"Touque\" without bloodshed.(779) To this the citizens sent a\r\ndutiful reply on the 28th day of the same month, assuring the king of the\r\npeaceful condition of the city. On the 2nd September an order went forth\r\nfrom the Common Council of the City that each alderman should immediately\r\ninstruct the constables of his ward to go their rounds and warn all\r\nsoldiers they might come across, to vacate the City and set out on the\r\nking's service before the end of the week on pain of imprisonment.(780)\r\nSuccess continued to attend Henry's arms. On the 5th September he was able\r\nto inform the citizens, by letter,(781) of the capture of Caen, excepting\r\nonly the citadel, and this was to be rendered to him by the 19th day of\r\nthe same month at the latest, unless relief should have previously arrived\r\nfor the besieged from the King of France, his son the Dauphin, or the\r\nCount of Armagnac, Constable of France. The Duke of Clarence wrote a few\r\ndays later to the citizens, notifying the extraordinary success which had\r\nfollowed the king. So many towns and fortresses had been taken that the\r\nonly fear was that there were not sufficient men to keep guard over\r\nthem.(782)\r\n\r\n(M415) (M416)\r\n\r\nIn order to keep the English force in Normandy better provided with\r\nvictuals, the Duke of Bedford, who had been left behind as the king's\r\nlieutenant, caused the Sheriffs of London to proclaim that all persons\r\nwilling and able to ship victuals to France for Henry's use, might do so\r\nwithout paying custom dues on their giving security that the victuals\r\nshould be sent to Caen and not elsewhere.(783) Bedford, who was learning\r\nhow to rule a free people--a lesson which, had he been allowed to practice\r\nin after years, might have saved the house of Lancaster from utter\r\ndestruction(784)--presided in the parliament, which met in November, 1417.\r\nOn the 17th December this parliament granted the king two fifteenths and\r\ntwo tenths. No time was lost in taking measures for collecting these\r\nsupplies, the king's writ appointing commissioners for the City of London\r\nbeing issued the day following.(785)\r\n\r\n(M417)\r\n\r\nIn Paris matters were going on from bad to worse. Whilst the capital of\r\nFrance was at the mercy of a mob, Henry proceeded to lay close siege to\r\nRouen. Frequent proclamation was made in London for reinforcements to join\r\nthe king, either at Rouen or elsewhere in Normandy.(786) This was in\r\nApril, 1418, or thereabouts. On the 5th July, the Duke of Clarence\r\ninformed Richard Merlawe, the mayor, by letter, of the fall of Louviers,\r\nand of the expected surrender of Pont de l'Arche,(787) from which latter\r\nplace the duke wrote. On the 10th August Henry himself wrote to the\r\ncitizens informing them of his having sat down before Rouen and of the\r\nstraits his forces were in for lack of victuals and more especially of\r\n\"drink.\" He begged them to send as many small vessels as they could, laden\r\nwith provisions, to Harfleur, whence they could make their way up the\r\nSeine to Rouen.(788) In less than a month a reply was sent (8 Sept.) from\r\nGravesend under the seal of the mayoralty, informing Henry that the\r\ncitizens had been busy brewing ale and beer and purveying wine and other\r\n\"vitaille,\" and that they had despatched thirty butts of sweet\r\nwine--comprising ten of \"Tyre,\" ten of \"Romesey,\" and ten of \"Malvesy\"--and\r\n1,000 pipes of ale and beer. With these they had also sent 25,000 cups for\r\nthe king's \"host\" to drink out of.(789) In the meantime, the besieged\r\nreceived no such relief from the pains of hunger and thirst, and on the\r\n19th January, 1419, they were compelled to surrender their ancient\r\ntown.(790) The war continued throughout the year (1419), all attempts at a\r\nreconciliation proving abortive. Pointoise fell into Henry's hands; and\r\nboth Henry and the Duke of Clarence sent word of its capture to London.\r\nThe duke took the opportunity of asking that the freedom of the City might\r\nbe conferred on his servant, Roger Tillyngton, a skinner; but the citizens\r\nin acknowledging the duke's letter make no reference to his request.(791)\r\n\r\n(M418)\r\n\r\nOn the 17th August the king wrote again to the mayor, aldermen and commons\r\nof the City, thanking them for their \"kynde and notable prone of an ayde,\"\r\nwhich they had granted of their own free will, therein setting a good\r\nexample to others, and prayed them to follow such directions as the Duke\r\nof Bedford should give them respecting their proffered assistance. The\r\nbearer of this letter having been taken prisoner at Crotoye, a duplicate\r\ncopy of it was afterwards forwarded from Trie le Chastel on the 12th\r\nSeptember.(792)\r\n\r\n(M419)\r\n\r\nThe murder of John, Duke of Burgundy, by a partisan of the Dauphin, which\r\ntook place about this time, induced Duke Philip to come to terms with\r\nEngland in the hope of avenging his father's death;(793) and the French\r\nking, finding further resistance hopeless, was content to make peace. By\r\nthe treaty of Troyes (20 May, 1420), the Dauphin was disinherited in\r\nfavour of Henry, who was formally recognised as the heir to the French\r\ncrown, and who agreed to marry Catherine, daughter of Charles VI.(794) The\r\nmarriage took place on the 3rd June, and on the 14th a solemn procession\r\nwas made in London and a sermon preached at Paul's Cross in honour of the\r\nevent.(795)\r\n\r\n(M420) (M421)\r\n\r\nOn the 12th July Henry addressed a letter from Mant to the corporation of\r\nLondon informing them of his welfare. He had left Paris for Mant in order\r\nto relieve the town of Chartres, which was being threatened by the\r\nDauphin. The Duke of Burgundy had joined him and had proved himself \"a\r\ntrusty, lovvng and faithful brother.\" The king's expedition proved\r\nunnecessary, for the Dauphin had raised the siege before his arrival and\r\nhad gone into Touraine. To this letter a reply was sent under the\r\nmayoralty seal on the 2nd August, congratulating Henry upon his success,\r\nand assuring him that there was no city on earth more peaceful or better\r\ngoverned than his City of London.(796)\r\n\r\n(M422)\r\n\r\nOn the 26th January, 1421, the Duke of Gloucester, the Guardian of England\r\nin the king's absence, ordered the Sheriffs of London to announce that the\r\nqueen's coronation would take place at Westminster on the third Sunday in\r\nLent.(797) The king and queen landed at Dover with a small retinue on the\r\n1st February, and after a few days' rest at Canterbury, entered the city\r\nof London amid tokens of welcome and respect from the laity and clergy.\r\nThey took up their abode at the Tower, whence they were conducted on the\r\nday appointed for the coronation to Westminster by the citizens on foot\r\nand on horseback.(798)\r\n\r\n(M423)\r\n\r\nHenry had not been at home six months before he again left England, never\r\nto return.(799) The hopes that he entertained of reforming and governing\r\nhis possessions in France, and his ambition to have headed, sooner or\r\nlater, a crusade which should have stayed the progress of the Ottoman and\r\nhave recovered the sepulchre of Christ, were not destined to be realised.\r\nHe died at the Bois de Vincennes, near Paris, on the last day of August,\r\n1422, leaving a child nine months old--the unhappy Henry of Windsor who\r\nsucceeded to the throne as Henry VI. When the body of the late king was\r\nbrought over from France to be buried at Westminster, the citizens showed\r\nit every token of respect in its passage through London. The streets of\r\nthe city, as well as of the borough of Southwark, were cleaned for the\r\noccasion. The mayor, sheriffs, recorder and aldermen, accompanied by the\r\nchief burgesses, and clad in white gowns and hoods, went forth to meet the\r\nremains of the king they loved so well, as far as St. George's bar in\r\nSouthwark, and reverently conducted them to St. Paul's Church, where the\r\nfuneral obsequies were performed. The next day they accompanied the corpse\r\nto Westminster, where further ceremonies took place. Representatives of\r\nthe various wards were told off to line the streets, the solemnity of the\r\noccasion being marked by the burning of torches, whilst chaplains stood in\r\nthe porches of the various churches, clad in their richest copes, with\r\nthuribles in their hands, and chanted the _venite_ and incensed the royal\r\nremains as they passed. The livery companies provided amongst them 211\r\ntorches, and to each torch-bearer the city chamberlain gave a gown and\r\nhood of white material or \"blanket\" (_de blanqueto_), at the \"cost of the\r\ncommonalty.\" (800)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(M424)\r\n\r\nAt the death of Henry V the administration of affairs fell into the hands\r\nof his two brothers, John, Duke of Bedford, and Humfrey, Duke of\r\nGloucester. On the 29th September a writ was issued from Windsor, in the\r\nname of the infant on whom the crown of England had devolved, summoning\r\nfour citizens of London to attend a parliament to be held at Westminster\r\nat Martinmas,(801) and two days afterwards another was addressed to the\r\nsheriffs of London, enjoining them to make proclamation for the keeping\r\nthe king's peace, and authorising them to arrest and imprison rioters\r\nuntil the king and his council should determine upon their\r\npunishment.(802) The precise wishes of the late king as to the respective\r\nparts which Bedford and Gloucester were to undertake in the government of\r\nthe realm are not clearly known, but it is generally thought that he\r\nintended the former to govern France, whilst the latter was to act as his\r\nvicegerent in England. An attempt to carry out the arrangement was doomed\r\nto failure.\r\n\r\nAs soon as parliament met (9 Nov.) it took into consideration the\r\nrespective claims of the two dukes. Bedford had already (26 Oct.)\r\ndespatched a letter from Rouen, addressed to the civic authorities,\r\nsetting forth his right to the government of the realm, as elder brother\r\nof the deceased sovereign and as the party most interested in the\r\nsuccession to the crown. Without mentioning Gloucester by name, he warned\r\nthe citizens against executing orders derogatory to himself. He professed\r\nto do this, not from any ambitious designs of his own, but from a wish to\r\npreserve intact the laws, usage and customs of the realm.(803) After some\r\nhesitation, parliament resolved to appoint Bedford protector as soon as he\r\nshould return from France, but that during his absence Gloucester should\r\nact for him.(804)\r\n\r\n(M425)\r\n\r\nOn the 8th February of the new year (1423), the sheriffs of London\r\nreceived orders to make proclamation for all soldiers who were in the\r\nking's pay to assemble at Winchelsea by the 1st day of March, as an\r\nexpedition was to set sail from that port for the purpose of defending the\r\ntown and castle of Crotoye. The business was pressing and necessitated a\r\nrepetition of the order to the sheriffs a fortnight later (22 Feb.).(805)\r\n\r\n(M426)\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd February William Crowmere, the mayor, William Sevenoke,\r\nWilliam Waldene, and John Fray were appointed commissioners to enquire\r\ninto cases of treason and felony within the city; and two days later they\r\nfound Sir John Mortimer, who was charged with a treasonable design in\r\nfavour of the Earl of March, guilty of having broken prison.(806) He was\r\nsubsequently convicted of treason both by lords and commons, and sentenced\r\nto death.\r\n\r\n(M427)\r\n\r\nOn the 5th June (1423) the hearts of the citizens were gladdened with the\r\nnews that they were likely to be repaid some of the money they had\r\nadvanced to the king's grandfather. Orders were given for all persons to\r\nwhom Henry IV was indebted at the time of his decease, and who had not yet\r\nreceived from his executors a moiety of the sums due, to send in their\r\nbills and tallies to Sir John Pelham and John Leventhorp, two of the\r\nking's executors, sitting at the Priory of Saint Mary, Southwark, by the\r\nMonday next after Midsummer-day.(807) We can believe that few orders ever\r\nmet with readier response from the inhabitants of the city.\r\n\r\n(M428)\r\n\r\nAt home as well as abroad Gloucester soon made enemies; among them was his\r\nown uncle, the Chancellor, Henry Beaufort, Bishop of Winchester, a wealthy\r\nand ambitious prelate. During Gloucester's absence on the continent,\r\nwhither he had gone to recover the estates of his newly-married wife, the\r\nill-fated Jacqueline of Hainault, Beaufort garrisoned the Tower with\r\ncreatures of his own. When Gloucester returned mutual recriminations took\r\nplace, and the mayor was ordered (29 Oct., 1425) to prevent Beaufort\r\nentering the city. A riot ensued in which the citizens took the part of\r\nthe duke, and the bishop had to take refuge in Southwark. The quarrel was\r\npatched up for awhile until Bedford, who was sent for, should arrive to\r\nact as arbitrator.(808) He arrived in London on the 10th January, 1426.\r\nThe citizens, who had more than once been in communication with the\r\nduke(809) during his absence abroad, presented him with a pair of basins,\r\nsilver-gilt, containing 1,000 marks. The gift, however, does not appear to\r\nhave been so graciously received as it might have been, for a London\r\nalderman records that the donors, for all their liberality, \"hadde but\r\nlytylle thanke.\"(810)\r\n\r\n(M429)\r\n\r\nThe two brothers had not met since the death of Henry V. After prolonged\r\nnegotiations, a _modus vivendi_ between the parties was arrived at, and\r\nGloucester and the bishop were induced to shake hands. Beaufort left\r\nEngland soon afterwards with the Duke of Bedford, on the plea of making a\r\npilgrimage, and did not return until September, 1428, by which time he had\r\nbeen made a cardinal and appointed papal legate in England.\r\nNotwithstanding his legatine authority being unacknowledged by Gloucester\r\nand others, the citizens received him on his return \"worthily and\r\nloyally,\" riding out to meet him and escorting him into London.(811)\r\n\r\n(M430)\r\n\r\nGloucester had always been a favourite with the Londoners, until his\r\nconduct to his Flemish wife, whom he left behind on the continent to fight\r\nher own battles as best as she could, and the undisguised attention he\r\npaid to Eleanor Cobham, a lady in his wife's suite, whom he eventually\r\nmarried, estranged their favour. In August, 1424, the Common Council had\r\nvoted the duke a gift of 500 marks; and two years later--viz., in April,\r\n1426--the citizens raised a sum, variously stated to have been L1,000 and\r\n1,000 marks, for the benefit of his duchess.(812) The female portion of\r\nthe community were specially incensed against the duke, and a number of\r\nwomen went the length of presenting themselves before parliament in 1427,\r\nwith a letter complaining of his behaviour towards his wife. In March of\r\nthe next year (1428) the citizens themselves followed suit, and drew the\r\nattention of parliament, through the mouth of John Symond, their Recorder,\r\nto the wretched straits to which the duchess had been reduced, as\r\nwitnessed her own letters. They begged parliament to consider the best\r\nmeans for recovering for her the lands of Hainault, Holland and Zeeland,\r\nwhich had always been places of sure refuge for the English merchant, and\r\nthe rulers of which had ever been friendly to the king of England. The\r\ncitizens finally avowed themselves ready to take upon themselves their\r\nshare in any undertaking the lords and commons of the realm might decide\r\nupon.(813)\r\n\r\n(M431)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime matters had not gone well with the English in France. In\r\nJuly, 1427, the Earl of Salisbury came over to London for\r\nreinforcements.(814) In September of the following year he was able to\r\ninform the City of the success that had attended his recruited army.(815)\r\nHe was then within a short distance of Orleans, before which town he\r\nshortly afterwards met his death. Bedford continued the siege, but the\r\ntown held out until May, 1429, when it was relieved by the Maid from the\r\nlittle village of Domremi, and the English army was compelled to retreat.\r\n\r\n(M432)\r\n\r\nWhilst Bedford was conducting the siege of Orleans, and Jeanne Darc was\r\nmeditating how best to relieve the town, the citizens of London were\r\nsuffering from a severe dearth. At length the Common Council resolved (22\r\nJuly, 1429) to send agents abroad for the purpose of transmitting all the\r\ncorn they could lay their hands on to England. The assistance of Bedford,\r\nwho had by this time been compelled to raise the siege of Orleans, was\r\ninvoked.(816)\r\n\r\n(M433)\r\n\r\nBedford had recently been joined by Beaufort, who had become more than\r\never an object of hatred to Gloucester, and had lost to a certain extent\r\nthe goodwill of the nation by the acceptance of a cardinal's hat. He had\r\nset out on the 22nd June (1429), carrying with him a small force which he\r\nwas allowed to raise for the avowed object of prosecuting a Hussite\r\ncrusade in Bohemia, but which was eventually sent to France.(817) The\r\nquestion of his position in parliament and the council, now that he was a\r\ncardinal, was decided by the parliament which met on the 22nd September.\r\n\r\n(M434)\r\n\r\nMembers of parliament representing the City of London had hitherto been\r\nallowed a certain amount of cloth and fur trimming at the City's expense,\r\nwherewith to dress themselves and their personal attendants in a manner\r\nsuitable to the position they held. Those who had from time to time been\r\nelected members appear to have abused this privilege--where a yard had been\r\ngiven, they had literally taken an ell--and it was now thought to be high\r\ntime to take steps to check the abuse in future. Accordingly it was\r\nordained by the mayor and aldermen, on the 12th August of this year (and\r\nthe ordinance met with the approval of the commoners on the 29th day of\r\nthe same month), that for the future no alderman elected to attend\r\nparliament should take out of the chamber or of the commonalty more than\r\nten yards for gown and cloak, at 15_s._ the yard, and 100_s._ for fur if\r\nthe alderman had already served as mayor, otherwise he was to have no more\r\nthan five marks. Commoners were to be content with five yards of cloth and\r\n33_s._ 4_d._ for fur. Each alderman, moreover, was to be allowed eight\r\nyards of cloth at 28 pence a yard for two personal attendants, and each\r\ncommoner four yards of the same for one attendant, if the parliament was\r\nsitting in London or the neighbourhood, and eight yards for two attendants\r\nif parliament was sitting in some more remote place, \"as was formerly\r\nordained during the mayoralty of John Michell\" (1424-5).(818)\r\n\r\n(M435)\r\n\r\nThe condition of France necessitated the early coronation of the young\r\nking, whose right to the French crown had been established by the Treaty\r\nof Troyes. At his accession to the throne of England Henry VI was but a\r\nchild of nine months. He was now eight years old. Before he could be\r\ncrowned King of France, it was necessary that he should first be crowned\r\nKing of England. Proclamation was accordingly made that he would be\r\ncrowned on the 6th November following, and that all claims to services\r\nshould be forthwith laid before the lord steward.(819) Gregory, to whose\r\nchronicle we have had frequent occasion to refer, writing as an\r\neye-witness, gives a full account(820) of what took place at the ceremony\r\nof coronation in Westminster Abbey, and of the banquet that followed; but\r\nomits to mention that the citizens put in their usual claim, in accordance\r\nwith the above proclamation, to serve the king at the banquet as butler.\r\nThat the claim was actually made we learn from other sources.(821) We also\r\nknow that William Estfeld, the recently-elected mayor, received the\r\ncustomary gold cup and ewer used on the occasion, which he afterwards\r\nbequeathed to his grandson.(822)\r\n\r\n(M436) (M437)\r\n\r\nIn April, 1430, the young king left England for France, and remained\r\nabroad for nearly two years. On the 10th November he wrote to the mayor\r\nand citizens, urging them to advance him the sum of 10,000 marks, as that\r\nsum might do him more ease and service at that particular time than double\r\nthe amount at another. The letter was dated from Rouen, where the court\r\nafterwards established itself for a considerable time.(823) On Sunday, the\r\n12th December, 1431, he made his entry into Paris with great ceremony, and\r\nwas duly crowned.(824)\r\n\r\n(M438)\r\n\r\nOn his return to England early in the following year, he was met by John\r\nWelles, the mayor, the aldermen, the sheriffs, and more than 12,000\r\ncitizens of London, who rode out on Thursday, the 20th February, as far as\r\nBlackheath, and was there presented with the following address:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    _\"Sovereign lord as welcome be ye to your noble Roialme of\r\n    Englond, and in especial to your notable Cite London o■erwise\r\n    called your Chambre, as ever was cristen prince to place or\r\n    people, and of the good and gracioux achevyng of your Coronne of\r\n    Fraunce, we thank hertlich our lord almyghty which of his endles\r\n    mercy sende you grace in yoye and prosperite on us and all your\r\n    other people long for to regne.\"_\r\n\r\n\r\n(M439)\r\n\r\nAfter hearing the address the king rode to Deptford, where he was met by a\r\nprocession of 120 rectors and curates of the city, in the richest copes,\r\nand 500 secular chaplains in the whitest of surplices, with whom were a\r\nlike number of monks bearing crosses, tapers and incense, and chanting\r\npsalms and antiphons in grateful thanks for his safe return. Thence the\r\nroyal cavalcade passed through Southwark to the city, where pageants\r\nappeared at every turn. The fulsome adulation bestowed upon a lad scarcely\r\nten years of age was enough to turn his young brain. Passing through\r\nCornhill and Chepe, the procession eventually reached St. Paul's. There\r\nthe king dismounted, and being met by the Archbishop of Canterbury and ten\r\nother bishops in their pontifical robes, was led by them to the high\r\naltar. Prayers were said and the sacred relics kissed. The king then\r\nremounted his horse and made his way to his palace of Westminster, the\r\nstreets being hung with tapestry and the houses thronged to their roofs\r\nwith crowds of onlookers, and was there allowed a brief day's rest. On the\r\nfollowing Saturday a deputation from the city, headed by the mayor and\r\naldermen, went to the palace and presented Henry with L1,000 of the purest\r\ngold, in a gold casket, with these words:--\r\n\r\n\"_Most cristen prince the good folk of youre notable Cite of London,\r\notherwise cleped your Chambre, besechen in her most lowely wise that they\r\nmowe be recomanded un to yo__r__ hynesse, ant ■__t__ can like youre noble\r\ngrace to resceyve this litell yefte yoven with as good will and lovyng\r\nhertes as any yefte was yoven to eny erthly prince._\"\r\n\r\nThe king having graciously acknowledged the gift, the deputation returned\r\nto the city.(825)\r\n\r\n(M440)\r\n\r\nBeaufort, who had returned home in time for the coronation, had again set\r\nout for France with the king, and Gloucester took advantage of their\r\nabsence to renew his attack on his rival. Letters of _proemunire_ were\r\ndrawn up in anticipation of the cardinal's return, and additional offence\r\nwas given by the seizure of the cardinal's plate and jewels at Dover. On\r\nlearning of Gloucester's schemes, Beaufort determined to give up a\r\nprojected visit to Rome, and to return home in time for the opening of\r\nparliament (12th May, 1432).(826) He desired to learn why he had been thus\r\n\"strangely demeened\" contrary to his deserts. When parliament met and the\r\ncardinal asked who were his accusers, Gloucester held his tongue, and the\r\nking expressed his confidence in the cardinal's loyalty. In the following\r\nyear (1433) Bedford appeared before parliament and announced that he had\r\ncome home to defend himself against false accusations. He understood that\r\nthe recent losses that had occurred in France were attributed to his\r\nneglect. He desired his accusers, of whom he shrewdly suspected Gloucester\r\nto be one, to stand forth and prove their charges. Again there was\r\nsilence, and the duke, like the cardinal, had to rest satisfied with the\r\nking's assurance of loyalty.(827)\r\n\r\n(M441)\r\n\r\nThe finances of the country were at this time (1433) in the most\r\ndeplorable condition. It was necessary to exercise the strictest economy.\r\nBedford was the first to set an example of self-denial by offering to\r\ndischarge the duties of counsellor at a reduced salary. Gloucester\r\nfollowed his brother's example. The archbishops, the cardinal, and the\r\nbishops of Lincoln and Ely agreed to render their services without\r\npayment. Parliament showed its good will by voting a fifteenth and tenth,\r\nbut out of the sum thus realised L4,000 was to be applied to the relief of\r\npoor towns. The amount of relief which fell to the share of the poorer\r\nwards of the City of London was L76 15_s._ 6-1/4_d._, which was\r\napportioned among eighteen wards. The largest sum allotted was L20, which\r\nwent to Cordwainer Street Ward, whilst Lime Street Ward received the\r\nmagnificent relief afforded by the odd farthing.(828) The mayor, sheriffs\r\nand aldermen were called upon to attend in person before the chancellor,\r\nin April, 1434, to make oath that they would duly observe a certain\r\narticle (_quendam articulum_) which the late parliament had agreed to, but\r\nwhat this article was does not appear in the City's archives.(829)\r\n\r\n(M442)\r\n\r\nBedford was prevailed upon to remain in England and undertake the office\r\nof chief counsellor, but differences again arising between him and\r\nGloucester, which the personal interference of the young king could with\r\ndifficulty calm, he again set sail for France (June, 1434). His career was\r\nfast drawing to an end. Burgundy was intending to desert him as he knew\r\nfull well, and the knowledge accelerated his end. His death took place at\r\nRouen on the 14th September of the following year (1435).(830)\r\n\r\n(M443)\r\n\r\nWith his death England's supremacy in France began to decline, and Henry\r\nVI was to lose in that country all or nearly all that had been gained by\r\nhis doughty predecessor. The defection of Burgundy was followed by the\r\nloss of Paris. The chief event of 1436 was the raising of the siege of\r\nCalais, which had been invested by the Duke of Burgundy. On the 27th June\r\nthe mayor and aldermen of Calais, being anxious to get help from the\r\ngovernment at home, and finding that according to precedent they could\r\nonly do so through the mediation of the City of London, addressed a letter\r\nto the mayor and aldermen of London imploring them, as the head of \"the\r\nprincipal of all the cities of the realm of England,\" to move the king to\r\nsend the requisite aid.(831)\r\n\r\nIn answer to this appeal Henry Frowyk, the mayor, consulted the livery\r\ncompanies, and by their advice sent a contingent to the relief of the\r\ntown.(832) The king, too, had been very urgent that the City should raise\r\na force to oppose \"the man who stiled himself Duke of Burgundy and Count\r\nof Flanders,\" whilst he took pains to conciliate such Flemings as were\r\nliving in the city and were ready to take an oath of allegiance.(833)\r\nGloucester had been appointed captain of Calais for a term of nine years,\r\nbut before he set sail for its relief the siege had been raised by Edmund\r\nBeaufort, Count of Mortain.(834)\r\n\r\n(M444)\r\n\r\nAn attempt was made in 1439 to bring about a peace, but it failed, and a\r\nnew tax--a tax upon aliens--had to be imposed for the purpose of raising\r\nmoney in addition to the usual supplies. Every alien householder was\r\ncalled upon to pay sixteen pence, and every alien who was not a\r\nhouseholder sixpence, towards the expenses of the country.(835)\r\n\r\n(M445)\r\n\r\nThe streets of the city have witnessed few sadder sights than the penance\r\ninflicted on Eleanor Cobham, at one time the mistress, and afterwards--on\r\nthe dissolution of his marriage with Jacqueline--the wife of Gloucester.\r\nThe new duchess was aware that in the event of the king's death her\r\nhusband was next in succession to the throne, and was inclined to\r\nanticipate matters. It was a superstitious age, and the duchess invoked\r\nthe aid of witchcraft to accomplish her wishes. In 1441 her operations,\r\ninnocent as they were in themselves, however bad their intent, were\r\ndiscovered, and she was condemned to do public penance followed by\r\nimprisonment for life. For three days the wretched lady was made to walk\r\nthe streets, taper in hand and bare-foot (it was November), in the sight\r\nof all the citizens, who were forbidden to show her any respect, but, at\r\nthe same time, were ordered not to molest her.(836) The latter they were\r\nlittle likely to do. Nay! on each day as she landed at the Temple, at the\r\nSwan or at Oueenhithe, the mayor and sheriffs went forth to attend her,\r\naccompanied by members of the livery companies.(837) Yet, not a finger did\r\nher husband raise in her defence! He either could not or would not save\r\nher.\r\n\r\n(M446)\r\n\r\nBy charter, dated the 26th day of October, 1444, the king confirmed the\r\nmayor, recorder and certain aldermen as justices of the peace, and, among\r\nother things, granted to the corporation the soil of the Thames within the\r\nCity's liberties.(838) This grant was not made without some little\r\nopposition from the inhabitants of the neighbouring county of Surrey.(839)\r\n\r\n(M447)\r\n\r\nThe king was now under the influence of William de la Pole, Earl of\r\nSuffolk, by whose intervention a truce with France had been concluded on\r\nthe 28th May of this year (1444), to last until the 1st April, 1446. In\r\norder to strengthen the truce, a marriage was arranged between Henry and\r\nMargaret of Anjou. The princess came over to England early in the\r\nfollowing year, and was married on the 22nd April (1445). The match was\r\nnot altogether a popular one; nevertheless, when Margaret passed through\r\nthe city on her way to be crowned at Westminster, she was received \"in the\r\nmost goodly wise, with alle the citezines on horseback ridyng ayenst hir\r\nto the Blackheth in blew gownes and rede hodes.\"(840)\r\n\r\n(M448)\r\n\r\nThe truce was renewed, and Suffolk increased in popularity. After the\r\ndeaths of Gloucester and Cardinal Beaufort, within a few weeks of each\r\nother, in 1447, he became the king's chief adviser, and continued to be so\r\nuntil the loss of the French provinces three years later (1450) raised so\r\nmuch opposition against him that the king was compelled to order his\r\nbanishment. This was not thought a sufficient punishment by his enemies,\r\nand he was taken on the high seas and brutally murdered (2 May). After his\r\ndeath an attack was made on his supporters. Again the men of Kent rose in\r\nrevolt; this time under the leadership of an Irish adventurer--Jack\r\nCade--who called himself Mortimer, and gave out that he was an illegitimate\r\nson of the late Earl of March. They mustered on Blackheath 30,000 strong\r\n(1 June), and then awaited the king's return from Leicester, where\r\nparliament had been sitting. Henry on his arrival sent to learn the reason\r\nof the gathering, and in reply received a long list of grievances which\r\nthe rebels intended to amend.(841)  Notwithstanding the boldness of this\r\nanswer, the king had only to make proclamation that all his true and liege\r\nsubjects should \"a-voyde the fylde,\" for the whole force to disperse in\r\nthe course of one night. The danger, indeed, seemed to be over. A week\r\nlater, however, the royal force met a number of the rebels near Sevenoaks,\r\nby whom it was put to rout. Encouraged by this success, the rebels\r\nreturned and took up their quarters in Southwark. The unhappy king had by\r\nthis time retired to Kenilworth, notwithstanding the offer made by the\r\ncitizens of London to stand by him.(842)\r\n\r\n(M449)\r\n\r\nThe city authorities had, in the meantime, taken steps to put the city\r\ninto a state of defence. A Common Council met on the 8th June, when it\r\ndecided that an efficient guard should be placed night and day upon all\r\ngates, wharves and lanes leading to the Thames. An enclosure recently\r\nerected at \"le Crane\" on the riverside belonging to John Trevillian, was\r\nordered to be abated. Balistic machines (_fundibula_) of all kinds were to\r\nbe collected on the wharves, whilst the sale of weapons or armour or their\r\nremoval out of the city was restricted. Lastly, it was agreed to represent\r\nto the king the advisability of limiting the number of his nobles coming\r\ninto the city, owing to the scarcity of provisions.(843) On the 26th June\r\nthe Common Council again met, and it was then decided to send two mounted\r\nmen to reconnoitre Cade's position, and to learn, if possible, his\r\nmovements.(844) Three days later (29 June) orders were given for four men\r\nto be selected from each ward to assist the aldermen in preserving the\r\npeace. Anyone refusing to do his duty in keeping watch was to be sent to\r\nprison. In spite of all precautions, Cade and his followers succeeded in\r\ngaining a footing in the city (3 July), their first action being to sack\r\nthe house of Philip Malpas.(845) Cade himself encouraged rather than\r\nrestrained the excesses of his men. \"Now is Mortimer lord of the City,\" he\r\ncried as he struck with his sword the old Roman mile-stone known as London\r\nstone.(846) It is clear that the rebels had friends in the city, otherwise\r\nthey would never have effected an entrance so easily--\"They had othyr men\r\nwith hem as welle of London as of there owne party.\"(847) The matter was\r\nmade the subject of investigation by the Common Council. Evidence was\r\ngiven by Thomas Geffrey, a barber, to the effect that on Friday, the 3rd\r\nJuly, the keys of the bridge had been given up, but by whom he knew not.\r\nWilliam Reynold also deposed that Richard Philip, a grocer, had told him\r\nthat unless the wardens of the bridge opened the gates, the Kentish\r\ncaptain threatened to set fire to the bridge and the city, and that\r\nthereupon Thomas Godfrey, a \"sporyour,\" clad in russet, brought the keys\r\nand opened the gates.(848)\r\n\r\n(M450)\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, the 4th of July, the rebels, who had retired for the night,\r\nreturned to the city. Robert Horne, alderman of Bridge Ward, who had\r\nrendered himself especially obnoxious to the rebels, was made prisoner and\r\nsent to Newgate. Sir James Fiennes, the Lord Say, was brought from the\r\nTower to the Guildhall, where the rebels were holding mock trials on those\r\nwho were unfortunate enough to fall into their hands, and, after a hasty\r\nexamination, was conveyed to the Standard in Chepe and there executed. His\r\nhead, together with those of two others who had that day suffered a\r\nsimilar fate, was set up on London Bridge.\r\n\r\n(M451)\r\n\r\nBy the next evening (Sunday) the citizens had managed to recover their\r\npresence of mind, and sallied out at ten o'clock at night, under the\r\nleadership of Lord Scales and another, across the bridge. Before they had\r\narrived on the Southwark side of the river they were met by the rebels,\r\nand a severe fight took place between the parties on the bridge itself,\r\nlasting until eight o'clock the next morning. At last the rebels were\r\ndefeated, and the city freed from their presence. Offers of pardon were\r\nmade and accepted, and the rebels dispersed. Cade, however, continued to\r\nplunder and ravage the country, until a price having been put upon his\r\nhead, he was apprehended by the Sheriff of Kent,(849) and died the same\r\nnight from injuries received at his capture. His head was subsequently set\r\nup on London Bridge.\r\n\r\n(M452)\r\n\r\nThe king had now been married some years, and no heir had appeared. Great\r\nuncertainty prevailed as to the right of succession to the throne, and\r\ngave rise to much rivalry and mutual mistrust between Richard, Duke of\r\nYork, who now for the first time becomes a conspicuous figure on the\r\nstage, and Edmund Beaufort, recently created Duke of Somerset. Both of\r\nthem could claim to be the king's nearest kinsmen, both of them being\r\ndescendants of Edward III, the one tracing his descent, on his father's\r\nside, through Edmund Langley, and on his mother's side, through Lionel,\r\nDuke of Clarence, whilst the other was the surviving representative of\r\nJohn of Gaunt.\r\n\r\n(M453)\r\n\r\nThe king's incapacity to govern without a strong minister at his back, as\r\nevinced by his conduct during the recent outbreak, induced both of these\r\nnobles to throw up their appointments, the one in Ireland and the other in\r\nFrance, and to hasten home. The Duke of York was the first to reach\r\nEngland, and, in spite of measures which had been taken to intercept him,\r\nmade his way to London. He was anxious in the first place to clear himself\r\nof suspicion of having been implicated in Cade's rebellion,(850) and to\r\nthis end sought and obtained an interview with the king. Having satisfied\r\nHenry on this point, he next proceeded to demand the reform of certain\r\nabuses in the government. A short session of parliament, which met on the\r\n6th November, opened with an altercation between the rival dukes. On the\r\n1st December Somerset was placed under arrest; and on the following day\r\nhis lodgings at the Black Friars were broken into and pillaged. An example\r\nwas made of one of the men convicted of being concerned in the breaking\r\ninto the Black Friars, and he was beheaded at the Standard in Chepe. The\r\nDuke of York made a personal visit to the city, and caused proclamation to\r\nbe made of the heavy pains and penalties which should follow any attempt\r\nat robbery. As a further demonstration against lawlessness, the king\r\nhimself rode through the city a few days later, accompanied by his lords\r\nin full panoply, the route being kept by a line of armed citizens on\r\neither side of the way. Alderman Gregory, whose chronicle affords us a\r\nvivid picture of contemporary events, and who was called upon to serve the\r\noffice of mayor of the city the following year, confesses that the\r\nprocession on this occasion would have been a gay and glorious sight, \"if\r\nhit hadde ben in Fraunce, but not in Ingelonde,\" for it boded little\r\ngood.(851)\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Somerset did not long remain in prison, for immediately after\r\nChristmas he was appointed captain of Calais. In 1451 the disasters which\r\nfollowed the English arms in France, when Calais was again threatened,\r\nwere made an occasion for another attempt by York to crush his rival. He\r\nopenly avowed his determination to proceed against Somerset, and, joined\r\nby the Earl of Devonshire and Lord Cobham, marched to London (Jan., 1452).\r\nHenry at once prepared to march against his cousin. The duke had hoped\r\nthat through the influence of his party within the city, the gates would\r\nhave been flung open on his approach. In this he was disappointed. The\r\nmajority of the citizens were still loyal to Henry, and by his orders\r\nentrance was denied the duke, who thereupon withdrew to Dartford, whilst\r\nthe king's forces encamped at Blackheath.\r\n\r\n(M454)\r\n\r\nFor a time civil war was avoided, the king promising that Somerset should\r\nbe again committed to custody until he should answer such charges as York\r\nshould bring against him. The king, however, failed to keep his word.\r\nSomerset was allowed to remain in power, and York was only allowed his\r\nliberty after he had consented to swear public allegiance to the king in\r\nSt. Paul's Church. Any stronger measures taken against him would probably\r\nhave provoked disturbance in the city.(852)\r\n\r\n(M455)\r\n\r\nHenry's mind had never been strong, and in the following year (1453) it\r\nentirely gave way. In October the queen bore him a son, after eight years\r\nof married life, but though the infant was brought to his father, Henry\r\ngave no signs of recognising his presence. The illness of the king, and\r\nthe birth of an heir to the crown, were events which materially affected\r\nthe fortunes of the Duke of York. In November the civic authorities\r\nprepared for emergencies; every citizen was to provide himself with\r\narmour, but he was strictly enjoined to be guarded in his conversation,\r\nand not to provoke tumult by showing favour to this or that lord. Even a\r\nproposal that the mayor and aldermen should pay a visit of respect to the\r\nDuke of York was rejected as impolitic at the present juncture.(853)\r\n\r\n(M456)\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding liberal grants made by parliament for the defence of\r\nCalais, that town was still in danger. On the 29th November, 1453, a\r\nletter was read before the Common Council of the City, emanating from the\r\nLord Welles and the Lord Ryvers, asking for assistance towards putting\r\nCalais into a state of defence. Further consideration of the matter was\r\nadjourned until the following 4th December. By the 7th day of the same\r\nmonth the Council had consulted the commons, who had declared that owing\r\nto their numerous burdens and expenses they could contribute nothing to\r\nthat end.(854) This did not prevent a further application being made early\r\nin 1454, for contributions towards the defence of Calais if that town were\r\nbesieged.(855) Again the commons were consulted, and again they pleaded\r\nthe excessive burdens they were already called upon to bear, and the\r\nlosses they had sustained by seizure of their ships and merchandise by the\r\nDuke of Burgundy, rendering them unable for the present to undertake any\r\nfurther charges unless steps were taken for the recovery of their\r\ngoods.(856) An answer to this effect was accordingly delivered by the\r\nCommon Sergeant on behalf of the citizens, who declared themselves willing\r\nat the same time to bear their share with the rest of the realm.(857) An\r\nappeal made in August of the same year (1454), for the sum of L1,200 for\r\nthe same purpose, met with similar failure.(858)\r\n\r\nThe plea of poverty was no idle one, if we may judge from the fact that\r\nwhen, in November of this year, an assessment of half a fifteenth was made\r\non the city wards, eleven out of twenty-five wards were in default.(859)\r\nBetween the years 1431 and 1451 the citizens had advanced large sums of\r\nmoney to the king, of which more than L3,000 remained in the latter year\r\ndue to the city.(860)\r\n\r\n(M457)\r\n\r\nA crisis, in the meanwhile, was fast approaching. The birth of an heir to\r\nthe throne urged the Duke of York to take prompt action. Although the\r\nmajority of the nobles were opposed to him, he had on his side the\r\npowerful family of the Nevills, having married Cicely Nevill, sister of\r\nRichard Nevill, Earl of Salisbury, the head of the family, and father of\r\nthe still more powerful Earl of Warwick. Towards the end of January (1454)\r\nthe Duke of York, the Earls of Salisbury and Warwick, and others of the\r\nduke's supporters, entered the city, each followed by a large force of\r\nretainers fully armed. With them came also York's eldest son, the Earl of\r\nMarch, afterwards King Edward IV.(861)\r\n\r\nThe Common Council were anxious lest the presence of these nobles in the\r\ncity should lead to a disturbance. A strict neutrality was ordered to be\r\nobserved both by the mayor and aldermen, as well as by the inhabitants of\r\nthe city at large. The _waytes_, or watchmen, were ordered to perambulate\r\nthe streets every night with their minstrels to keep the citizens in good\r\nhumour (_pro recreacione hominum_), and prevent robbery. Nevertheless,\r\nthere is evidence to show that disturbances did occasionally arise between\r\nthe inhabitants and those in the suite of the nobles.(862)\r\n\r\n(M458)\r\n\r\nThe king's continued illness necessitated sooner or later the appointment\r\nof a regent. For a brief space there seemed a possibility of the regency\r\nbeing claimed by the queen. The City, in the meanwhile, paid court to both\r\nparties, the mayor and aldermen one day paying a solemn visit to the\r\nqueen, attired in their gowns of scarlet, and a few days later paying a\r\nsimilar compliment to the Duke of York.(863) At length the duke was\r\nnominated protector (3 April). Some correspondence ensued between the\r\nCity, the Duke of York, the queen, and the Earl of Salisbury, on what\r\nsubject we know not,(864) but on the 13th May the mayor and aldermen\r\nwaited upon the duke to thank him for his favour and goodwill.(865)\r\n\r\n(M459)\r\n\r\nSo long as the king remained an imbecile York was supreme, his rival,\r\nSomerset, having been committed to prison at his instigation in December,\r\n1453. Henry, however, soon recovered from his illness, although his\r\nconvalescence proved of equally short duration, and York's protectorate\r\ncame to an end. With Henry's restoration came the release of Somerset, and\r\nYork determined to try conclusions with his rival in the field. At the\r\nfirst battle of St. Albans, fought on the 22nd May, 1455, victory declared\r\nfor York and Somerset was killed. After the battle York accompanied the\r\nking to London and lodged him in the bishop's palace in St. Paul's\r\nchurchyard. The excitement caused Henry a relapse, and York was for the\r\nsecond time named protector; but in the spring of 1456 he had again to\r\nretire upon the king's recovery.\r\n\r\n(M460)\r\n\r\nJust when the country was settling down to enjoy a period of comparative\r\nquiet, there occurred (May, 1456) in the city one of those sudden\r\noutbreaks against the \"merchant stranger\" residing within the city's walls\r\nwhich too often appear in the annals of London. On this occasion the young\r\nmercers of the city rose against the Lombards; why or wherefore we are not\r\ntold. We only know that these foreigners received such bad treatment that\r\nthey meditated leaving the city in a body and setting up business\r\nelsewhere. The fault was not altogether with the citizens, it appears; for\r\ntwo Lombards were ordered to be hanged.(866)\r\n\r\nThe king, who was at the time at Coventry--whither the queen had caused him\r\nto be removed, owing to her suspicion that the Londoners were in favour of\r\nthe Yorkist party--sent for alderman Cantelowe,(867) a mercer, and promptly\r\ncommitted him to Dudley Castle for safe keeping, as having been implicated\r\nin the attack on the houses of the Italian merchants.\r\n\r\nThis outbreak was followed by another \"hurlynge\" between the mercers of\r\nthe city and those Lombards who had consented to remain in the city on the\r\nunderstanding that they should be allowed to ply their business without\r\nmolestation until the council or parliament should determine otherwise. In\r\nconsequence of this second outbreak no less than 28 mercers were arrested\r\nand committed to Windsor Castle.(868)\r\n\r\n(M461)\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd September, 1456, the king wrote from Lichfield to the Mayor,\r\nreminding him of the dangers which had recently threatened the city--\"the\r\nking's chamber\"--the government whereof ought to serve as an example to the\r\nrest of the kingdom, and enjoining him that thenceforth he should allow no\r\none to enter the city but such as came peaceably, and with moderate\r\nretinue, according to his estate and degree, and should take precautions\r\nagainst gatherings of evil disposed persons which might lead to a breach\r\nof the peace.(869)\r\n\r\n(M462)\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the precautions taken to protect the coast, the French\r\nmade a descent in 1457, and plundered Sandwich and Fowey, capturing over\r\n30 ships, great and small, and doing much damage. The citizens of London,\r\nto whom the protection of their commerce in the \"narrow sea,\" as the\r\nchannel was then frequently called, was everything, thereupon took counsel\r\namong themselves, and made a proposal to the king and to Bishop Waynflete,\r\nthe chancellor, to find 2,000 men and provisions for certain ships then\r\nlying in the Thames, at their own expense, to join an expedition to punish\r\nthe enemy for their boldness. The king thanked them for their patriotic\r\nspirit and gave orders for a naval force to join the city contingent from\r\nHull.(870)\r\n\r\n(M463)\r\n\r\nIn 1458 Henry tried his hand at effecting a reconciliation between the two\r\nrival sections of the nobility, and to this end ordered a great council to\r\nmeet in St. Paul's on the 27th January. Warwick left his post at Calais,\r\nand came over to London to attend the meeting; but he did not arrive until\r\nmore than a month after the appointed day, and when he came it was with a\r\nbody of 600 men at his back, \"all apparyled in reed jakkettes, with whyte\r\nragged stavis.\"(871) He took up his quarters within the city, where he\r\nfound the Duke of York and the Earl of Salisbury. The young Duke of\r\nSomerset and other lords, who, like him, had lost their fathers at the\r\nbattle of St. Albans, were refused an entrance to the city for fear of a\r\nbreach of the peace, and had to find accommodation outside the city's\r\nwalls.(872) During the conference the mayor patrolled the streets by day,\r\nwhilst at night a force of 3,000 men was kept in readiness to assist the\r\naldermen in preserving the king's peace.(873) The times were critical, but\r\nat length all ended well. A grand pacification took place in March, and\r\nwas solemnized by an imposing procession to St. Paul's, in which York led\r\nthe queen by the hand. The reconciliation thus effected was more apparent\r\nthan real, and neither party relaxed their efforts to prepare for renewed\r\nhostility.\r\n\r\n(M464) (M465) (M466)\r\n\r\nIn August the civic companies were warned against furnishing the\r\nconfederate lords with any war material, but were to keep their arms and\r\nharness at the disposal of the king alone.(874) It wanted very little to\r\nkindle the smouldering embers of dissatisfaction into a flame, and this\r\nlittle was soon forthcoming. In November(875) a riot occurred at\r\nWestminster, in which the Earl of Warwick was implicated. A yeoman in his\r\nsuite picked a quarrel with one of the king's servants and wounded him.\r\nThereupon others of the king's household, finding their fellow-servant\r\nwounded and his enemy escaped, way-laid the earl and his attendants as\r\nthey left the council to take barge on the river. By dint of hard hitting,\r\nthe earl managed to embark and to make his way to the city. But the affray\r\nwas not without bloodshed, and Warwick found it convenient to withdraw\r\nsoon afterwards to his post at Calais, which thenceforth became the\r\nhead-quarters of the disaffected lords.\r\n\r\n(M467)\r\n\r\nIn the following April (1459) another affray broke out. This time it was\r\nbetween inhabitants of the city and certain members of the Inns of Court,\r\nand the riot was so dangerous as to result in loss of life. The king\r\nhearing of this sent for William Tayllour, the alderman of the ward, and\r\nkept him in confinement at Windsor until the election of the new mayor,\r\nWilliam Hewlyn, in October, by whose intercession he regained his\r\nfreedom.(876)\r\n\r\n(M468)\r\n\r\nBy this time the country was again divided into two hostile camps. A\r\ncrisis came in September, when the Earl of Salisbury, the king's most\r\ninveterate enemy, marched upon Ludlow with a large force. Lord Audley,\r\nsent by the queen to arrest him, was defeated by the earl at Blore Heath\r\n(23 Sept., 1459). Later on, however, the earl and the Yorkist army were\r\nthemselves compelled to seek security. The Duke of York took refuge in\r\nIreland, and the Earl of Warwick, who had crossed from France to join his\r\nfather, returned to Calais, taking the Earl of Salisbury with him.\r\n\r\n(M469)\r\n\r\nOn the 9th October the king issued his writ for a parliament to be held at\r\nCoventry on the 20th November. The usual writ was sent to the City of\r\nLondon, but the names of the aldermen and commoners elected to represent\r\nthe citizens do not appear in the City's records.(877) The business of the\r\nsession was the attainder of the Duke of York and his followers, and\r\njudgment was passed upon the duke, the Nevills, father and son, the young\r\nEarls of March and Rutland, and others. Two days after the date of this\r\nwrit, the Common Council decided to send a deputation to wait upon the\r\nking and assure him of the City's allegiance and of the steps taken for\r\nits safe custody.(878)\r\n\r\n(M470)\r\n\r\nThe citizens had previously (Oct., 1459) displayed their willingness to\r\nassist the king by a gift of 1,000 marks.(879) This gift must have been\r\nthe more welcome, inasmuch as Henry's debts had been rapidly on the\r\nincrease, whilst his creditors remained unpaid. The queen, on the other\r\nhand, into whose hands the government of the kingdom had been drawn, was\r\n\"gaderyng riches innumerable.\" The imposition of taxes, talliages and\r\nfifteenths, whilst harassing the king's subjects, seemed to make him not a\r\nwhit the richer, the issues and profits being frittered away. They would\r\nhave forgiven him had he maintained a household in regal style or spent\r\ntheir money on maintaining the country's honour in the field. As matters\r\nwere, Henry, by misgovernment, was rapidly losing the hearts of his\r\npeople, and \"theyre blessyng was turned in to cursyng.\"(880)\r\n\r\n(M471) (M472) (M473)\r\n\r\nOn the 14th January, 1460, the king issued a commission to the mayor,\r\naldermen and sheriffs for collecting men-at-arms and archers to resist the\r\n_late_ Duke of York and the _late_ Earls of March, Warwick, Salisbury and\r\nRutland.(881) Similar commissions were addressed to every township,(882)\r\nand did much harm to the royal cause, now tottering to its fall, as being\r\nunconstitutional. They formed the subject of one of the set of articles of\r\ncomplaint drawn up by the Earls of March, Warwick and Salisbury, and\r\naddressed by them, on behalf of themselves and the Duke of York, to the\r\narchbishop and the commons of England.(883) Such commissions the lords\r\ndeclared to be an imposition which, if continued, would be \"the heaviest\r\ncharge and worst example that ever grew in England.\" The city authorities\r\nappear to have rested their opposition to the king's commission, not so\r\nmuch on the grounds that they were unwilling to raise a force for his\r\nassistance, as that a demand for military aid in such a form might\r\nderogate from the city's franchise and liberties. A deputation, consisting\r\nof two aldermen, Thomas Urswyk, the Recorder, and one of the\r\nunder-sheriffs, was sent to Northampton to wait upon the king and council\r\nand to explain the views of the citizens in that respect. The interview\r\nwas of a satisfactory character; and the deputation returned bearing a\r\ngracious letter from the king declaring that the City's franchise and\r\nliberties should in no way be prejudiced by the commission.(884)\r\n\r\n(M474)\r\n\r\nThe citizens deemed it time to look to their own safety, and place their\r\ncity into a better posture of defence. The master and wardens of the\r\nlivery companies were exhorted (14 Feb., 1460), on account of the\r\ndisturbed state of the kingdom, to raise contributions towards the\r\npurchase of accoutrements for the safeguard of the city.(885) The king\r\nhimself was shortly coming into the city, and measures were taken (28\r\nFeb.) for placing a proper guard over the several gates.(886) On the 11th\r\nMay the masters and wardens were summoned, on behalf of the king, to\r\nappear before the mayor and aldermen at the Guildhall, to hear a royal\r\nproclamation read touching the preservation of the king's peace.(887)\r\n\r\n(M475)\r\n\r\nThe Yorkist Earls of Salisbury, Warwick and March, encouraged by the\r\nreports of the state of affairs in England, at length made up their minds\r\nto return and strike a blow for the recovery of their estates, which had\r\nbecome forfeited to the king. They set sail from Calais (26 June), and\r\nlanding at Sandwich made their way without opposition through Kent to\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n(M476)\r\n\r\nOn the 27th June, by which time news of their arrival must have reached\r\nthe city, a Common Council was held, when the commoners who were present\r\nsolemnly promised to stand by the mayor and aldermen in safe-guarding the\r\ncity, and resist with all their might the rebels against the lord the king\r\nwho were about to enter the city contrary to the king's orders. The civic\r\ncompanies somewhat tardily gave their adhesion to the royal cause, and\r\nagreed to defend the city. The gates were ordered to be manned, and no one\r\nwas to be allowed to enter without first saying who and what he was.\r\nStrict enquiry was to be made as to the character of strangers residing\r\nwithin each of their wards.(888) On the following day the Common Council\r\nmet again and gave orders that the drawbridge of London Bridge should be\r\nalways kept down, so that victuallers and others might have ready access\r\nto the City, but the gateway on the drawbridge was to be kept closed,\r\nwhilst _le wikett_ was to be constantly open. A strict watch was to be\r\nkept on the new tower(889) above the bridge by men-at-arms stationed\r\nthere, who should also be ready to let down _le port Colyce_ when occasion\r\nrequired.(890)\r\n\r\n(M477)\r\n\r\nA deputation, moreover, was appointed to set out to meet the Earls of\r\nMarch and Warwick on their way to Northampton, for the purpose of inducing\r\nthem, if possible, to turn aside and not approach the city. The members\r\nwere instructed to inform the lords of the king's commands to the citizens\r\nto hold the city for him, and to oppose the lords' entry under heavy\r\npenalty. This instruction to the deputation was given, we are told, with\r\nthe approval of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishops of Norwich, Ely\r\nand Exeter, and of the Prior of St. John's, Clerkenwell. The mayor,\r\naldermen and commonalty agreed to stand by any terms which the deputation\r\nmight be compelled to make. They had not taken this step without first\r\nconsulting the Lords Scales and Hungerford, and Sir Edmund Hampden, who\r\nheld the Tower of London for King Henry. The bridge gate was ordered to be\r\nclosed between nine and ten o'clock on the night of the 28th, and to\r\nremain closed till the morning. Even the portcullis was to be kept down if\r\nnecessary, whilst the mayor and sheriffs, with a certain number of armed\r\nmen, patrolled the city, and the aldermen kept watch in their several\r\nwards.(891) Notwithstanding the next day being Sunday, the critical state\r\nof affairs necessitated a meeting of the Common Council. It was then\r\nagreed that if any messenger should arrive from Warwick, no communication\r\nshould be held with him. Special watches were appointed for the bridge and\r\nfor Billingsgate by night and day, and so anxious were the authorities to\r\navail themselves of the service of every abled citizen on that Sunday,\r\nthat no one was allowed to attend Divine Service at St. Paul's.(892)\r\n\r\n(M478)\r\n\r\nUp to this point the citizens had shown themselves loyal to Henry. They\r\nnow began to waver. Early in the morning of the 30th June the mayor and\r\naldermen appear to have changed their minds. The earls had sent them a\r\nletter and they resolved to receive it. The contents of this letter are\r\nnot recorded. On the following day (1 July) another communication from the\r\nearls was received. Here again we are left in the dark as to its\r\npurport--the City's journals at this period being very imperfect,--we only\r\nknow that they declined to accede to the request to keep at a distance\r\nfrom London, for the very next day (2 July) they were admitted into the\r\ncity.(893)\r\n\r\n(M479)\r\n\r\nThe city was thus lost to the king; but the Tower still held out, and no\r\namount of eloquence on the part of certain doctors of divinity, whom the\r\nCommon Council had appointed to try and arrange matters so as to avoid\r\nbloodshed, would induce Lord Scales and his companions to surrender it,\r\nalthough the garrison was hard pressed for victuals.(894) Nothing was left\r\nbut to starve them out, and this the Earl of Salisbury proceeded to do,\r\nwith the aid of the citizens and the boatmen on the river, by whom the\r\nTower was strictly invested by land and water. The Common Council appear\r\nto have felt some qualms of conscience in joining in this proceeding, for\r\nthey caused it to be recorded--as if by way of excuse for their action--that\r\n\"there seemed to be no other way of preserving the city.\"(895) A\r\nresolution, moreover, that each alderman should subscribe the sum of L5\r\ntowards raising a force to intercept victuals on their way to the Tower\r\nwas rescinded.(896)\r\n\r\n(M480) (M481)\r\n\r\nBy the 10th July matters had become so serious with the beleaguered\r\ngarrison, that a letter was sent to the Common Council, signed by the Earl\r\nof Kendal, Lord Scales, Lord Hungerford, Lord Lovell and Sir Edmund\r\nHampden, asking why war was thus being made upon them. To this the Council\r\nreplied that the lords had brought it upon themselves by firing on the\r\ncitizens in the first instance, and taking provisions from them without\r\npayment.(897) At last the garrison could hold out no longer, and the Tower\r\nwas surrendered (19th July). Lord Scales endeavoured to take sanctuary at\r\nWestminster, but was seized by river boatmen and barbarously\r\nmurdered.(898)\r\n\r\n(M482)\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Duke of York had managed to raise a sum of money in the\r\ncity;(899) the battle of Northampton had been won and lost (10th July),\r\nand Henry had been brought a prisoner to London (16th July). On the same\r\nday that the king arrived in London, the mayor, aldermen and commonalty of\r\nthe City entered into an agreement, under the Common Seal, to abide by any\r\narrangement made between the Earl of Salisbury and the beleaguered lords\r\nin the Tower for the surrender of that stronghold.(900)\r\n\r\n(M483)\r\n\r\nOn the 21st July the king, or the Earl of Warwick, in his name, attempted\r\nto restore quiet in the city by promising that those who had offended\r\nagainst the king's highness and the common weal of the realm, and had been\r\ncommitted to the Tower, should forthwith receive ample justice. In the\r\nmeantime all conventicles, assemblies or congregations in breach of the\r\npeace were strictly forbidden, and every man was exhorted to repair to his\r\nown house, and wait upon his lord or master in whose service he might\r\nhappen to be.(901)\r\n\r\n(M484) (M485) (M486)\r\n\r\nIn October the Duke of York attended parliament and boldly asserted his\r\nright to the throne. After hearing arguments for and against his claim,\r\nparliament arrived at a compromise by which the reversion of the crown was\r\nsettled on the duke, and to this the king himself was forced to give his\r\nassent.(902) It was otherwise with the proud and defiant Queen Margaret.\r\nShe was determined to acquiesce in no such arrangement. Whilst she was\r\ncollecting a force in the north, wherewith to strike one blow for the\r\ncrown of which her son appeared likely to be robbed, the mayor and\r\naldermen held an extraordinary meeting of the wardens of the livery\r\ncompanies. The king wished to be assured of the temper of the citizens.\r\nWould they as a body support him and his council, protect his royal\r\nperson, and defend the city against those who were raising disturbances in\r\ndivers parts of the realm? To each and all of these questions the wardens\r\nare recorded as having given satisfactory replies, and it was then and\r\nthere agreed that each alderman should make enquiry as to the number of\r\nstrangers residing in his ward, and the reasons for their being in the\r\ncity. Watch was to be kept by night in every ward, a lantern hung outside\r\nevery dwelling-house, and the city's gates were to be closed every night\r\nand guarded by men-at-arms.(903) Although these measures were avowedly\r\ntaken on behalf of King Henry, they were, in reality, so many precautions\r\nfor securing the government in the hands of his rival the Duke of York.\r\n\r\n(M487)\r\n\r\nThe struggle which hitherto had been between two unequal sections of the\r\nnobility, each avowing its loyalty to the king, now became a struggle\r\nbetween the two rival Houses of Lancaster and York. Richard, Duke of York,\r\ndid not live to enjoy the crown, his right to the reversion of which had\r\nrecently been acknowledged by parliament. Just as the year was drawing to\r\na close he met his death at Wakefield in the first clash with the House of\r\nLancaster, and his head in mockery was set up on one of the city's gates\r\nfrom which he derived his ducal title.\r\n\r\n  \"Off with his head, and set it on York's gates;\r\n    So York may overlook the town of York.\"\r\n\r\n(M488)\r\n\r\nWhen Henry was once restored to liberty and to his queen, after the second\r\nbattle of St. Albans (17 Feb., 1461), York's son, Edward, Earl of March,\r\nwho became by his father's death heir to the crown, was immediately\r\nproclaimed traitor in the city.(904) The queen wished for victuals to be\r\nsent from the city to her forces at St. Albans, but the carts were seized\r\nbefore they left the city by a mob which refused to let them go in spite\r\nof the mayor's entreaties and threats. Margaret's army consisted for the\r\nmost part of rude northern followers who threatened to sack the city if\r\nonce allowed within its walls, and the majority of the inhabitants were\r\nunwilling to supply the queen with provisions until she had removed her\r\nhalf-disciplined force to a distance from London. With a civilized army at\r\nher back it might have been possible for Margaret to have gained a footing\r\nin the city.(905) As matters stood, she deemed it best to accede to the\r\nrequest thus made to her, and to draw off her army.\r\n\r\n(M489)\r\n\r\nIt was a fatal mistake, for it gave time for Edward and Warwick to join\r\nforces and march on London. The civic authorities, finding how hopeless it\r\nwas to place further dependence upon Henry, and desiring above all things\r\na stronger government than they could look for under the king, now\r\nsurrendered the city to his opponents. They had not forsaken the king--he\r\nhad forsaken them. They would no more of him.\r\n\r\n  \"He that had Londyn for sake,\r\n    Wolde no more to hem take.\"(906)\r\n\r\n(M490)\r\n\r\nOn the 1st March the chancellor called a general assembly of the citizens\r\nat Clerkenwell, and explained to them the title by which Edward, Duke of\r\nYork, laid claim to the crown.(907) His title was thereupon acknowledged\r\nwith universal applause, and on the 4th he proceeded to Westminster\r\nPalace, accompanied by many of the nobility and commons of the realm,(908)\r\nand was there proclaimed king by the name of Edward IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(M491)\r\n\r\nThe new king made himself very popular with the citizens. He was not less\r\na favourite with them because he joined their ranks and became a trader\r\nlike themselves, or because he took a wife from among his own subjects and\r\nmade her a sharer of his crown. At the coronations, both of Edward and his\r\nqueen, which took place after an interval of three years, the City was\r\nfully represented, and its claim to services at the king's coronation\r\nbanquet duly acknowledged.(909) At the latter ceremony no less than four\r\ncitizens, among them being Ralph Josselyn, the mayor, were created Knights\r\nof the Bath.(910) The citizens had previously shown their respect to\r\nElizabeth Woodville by riding forth to meet her and escorting her to the\r\nTower on her first arrival to London, and by presenting her with a gift of\r\n1,000 marks or L750.(911)\r\n\r\n(M492)\r\n\r\nIf the young and handsome prince who now ascended the throne occasionally\r\ncarried his familiarity with the wives of city burgesses beyond the limits\r\nof strict propriety, much could be forgotten and forgiven for the\r\nreadiness he showed to confirm and enlarge the City's privileges and to\r\nfoster the trade of the country. Before he had been on the throne many\r\nmonths he granted the citizens, by charter, the right of package and\r\nscavage, as well as the office of gauger of wines.(912)\r\n\r\n(M493)\r\n\r\nIn the following March (1462) he confirmed the charter granted to the City\r\nby Henry IV, whereby the citizens obtained the right of taking toll and\r\ncustom at Billingsgate, Smithfield and elsewhere, as well as the right of\r\n_tronage_ or weighing wool at the Tron.(913)\r\n\r\n(M494)\r\n\r\nIn August, 1462 Calais was again in danger, and the king wanted money. The\r\nEarl of Worcester and others of the council were sent into the city to ask\r\nfor a loan of L3,400. After considering the matter, the civic authorities\r\nagreed to lend him L1,000. The money was to be raised by assessment on the\r\nwards, but Dowgate ward being at the time very poor, was not to be\r\npressed.(914) In the following October the City again came to the king's\r\nassistance with a further loan of 2,000 marks,(915) and on the 9th\r\nNovember the City obtained (in return, shall we say?) a charter confirming\r\nits jurisdiction over the Borough of Southwark,(916) originally granted by\r\nEdward III. Again, the coincidence of a charter granted by the king to the\r\nCity, with a loan or gift from the City to the king, is remarkable.\r\n\r\n(M495)\r\n\r\nWhen Edward returned in February, 1463, from the North, where he had\r\nsucceeded with the assistance afforded him by the Londoners in\r\nre-capturing most of the castles which the restless Margaret had taken,\r\nthe City resolved to give him a befitting reception. Preparations were\r\nmade for the mayor, aldermen and commons to ride forth to meet him in\r\ntheir finest liveries, but the king having expressed his intention of\r\ncoming from Shene to the city by water, the citizens went to meet him in\r\ntheir barges, with all the pomp and ceremony of a Lord Mayor's day.(917)\r\n\r\n(M496)\r\n\r\nEdward now gave himself up to a life of luxury and pleasure. In 1464 he\r\nmarried the young widow of Sir John Grey, better known by her maiden name\r\nof Elizabeth Woodville. His marriage to her gave offence to the nobility,\r\nmore especially to the Earl of Warwick, who was planning at the time a\r\nmatch with France or Burgundy, and to whom the news of the marriage with\r\none so beneath the king in point of dignity came as an unpleasant\r\nsurprise. The earl was still more offended when he learnt that the young\r\nking had secretly effected a marriage treaty between his sister Margaret\r\n(whom Warwick had destined for one of the French princes) and the Duke of\r\nBurgundy. These matrimonial alliances, combined with the inordinate favour\r\nEdward displayed towards his wife's family, led to an estrangement between\r\nthe king and his powerful subject.\r\n\r\n(M497)\r\n\r\nThe proposed alliance with Burgundy was far from being distasteful to the\r\nmerchants of the city, inasmuch as it was likely to open up trade with\r\nthose states of the Low Countries which the Burgundian dukes had\r\nconsolidated as a barrier against France. When the Princess Margaret was\r\nabout to start (June, 1468) for her future husband's dominions, the mayor\r\nand aldermen of London testified their appreciation of the alliance by\r\npresenting her with a pair of silver gilt dishes, weighing 19 lbs. 8 oz.,\r\nbesides the sum of L100 in gold, by way of a wedding gift.(918)\r\n\r\n(M498)\r\n\r\nDisgusted with the king's unhandsome conduct towards him, Warwick found an\r\nally in Clarence, the king's brother, gave him one of his daughters in\r\nmarriage, and even encouraged him to hope for the succession to the crown.\r\nEdward's extravagant and luxurious life had lost him much of his\r\npopularity. He had ceased, moreover, to possess the goodwill of the\r\ncitizens for having allowed the arrest of Sir Thomas Cooke or Coke,(919)\r\nan alderman of the city, on a false charge of treason. Notwithstanding his\r\nacquittal, Cooke had been committed to prison and only regained his\r\nliberty on payment of an extortionate fine to the king and queen.(920)\r\nWarwick and Clarence made use of the general discontent that prevailed to\r\nfurther their own designs, and the civil war was renewed. The City\r\nendeavoured to steer a middle course. In June (1469) it lent the king the\r\nsum of L200, but in the following month it lent Warwick and Clarence just\r\nfive times that amount on the sole security of some jewels of little\r\nvalue.(921) In May, 1470, when there seemed little hope of the jewels\r\nbeing redeemed, as Warwick and Clarence had been obliged to flee to\r\nFrance, the Common Council entertained the thought of selling them for\r\nwhat they were worth. The sale did not take place, however, but they were\r\nkept some in the \"Treasury,\" and some in the custody of William Taillour,\r\nlate mayor, on the express understanding that he was not to be held\r\nresponsible in the event of their being stolen or taken by force.(922) In\r\nFebruary, 1471, when the wheel of fortune had once more placed Henry VI on\r\nthe throne from which he had been driven by Edward, and Warwick and\r\nClarence were again in power, the mayor and aldermen caused it to be\r\nplaced on record that the loan on the jewels had been made by agreement of\r\nthe whole court, with the assistance of certain commoners who had been\r\ncalled in to contribute. What their object was in so doing is not clear.\r\nPerhaps they felt some qualms as to what Edward might say or do in respect\r\nof the loan, should he again return to power. They, at the same time,\r\nextended the time for the repayment of the loan, at the desire of the\r\ndukes of Clarence and Warwick. If the jewels were not redeemed by\r\nWhitsuntide at the latest, they were to be sold.(923)\r\n\r\n(M499)\r\n\r\nWhilst Warwick and Clarence were in France in 1470, they concerted\r\nmeasures with Queen Margaret for effecting another revolution. By\r\nSeptember matters were ready for execution. On the 13th Warwick landed in\r\nEngland; and before the end of the month the Kentish men so threatened the\r\nCity and Westminster, that the newly-elected sheriffs had to be escorted\r\nby an armed force in order to be sworn in at the Exchequer, whilst a\r\nconstant patrol was kept in the streets.(924) On the 1st October it was\r\nmade known in the city that the king had taken flight. His queen took\r\nsanctuary at Westminster, leaving the Tower in the hands of the mayor and\r\naldermen and members of the council of Warwick and Clarence. The\r\nunfortunate Henry was quickly removed from the wretched cell in which he\r\nhad so long been confined to a commodious and handsomely furnished\r\napartment which the queen herself, being _enceinte_ at the time, purposed\r\noccupying when she should be brought to bed. A garrison was placed in the\r\nTower by order of the Common Council, sitting, for safety's sake, in the\r\nchurch of St. Stephen, Walbrook. On the 5th October Archbishop Nevill,\r\nWarwick's brother, entered the city with a strong force and relieved the\r\ncivic authorities of the custody of the Tower, and on the following day\r\nWarwick himself appeared, accompanied by Clarence and a large following,\r\nand removed Henry from the Tower to the Bishop of London's palace.(925)\r\nTwo days later (9 Oct.) he obtained from the Common Council the sum of\r\nL1,000 for the defence of his stronghold, Calais, besides a loan of L100\r\nfrom the aldermen of the city for his own private use.(926) On the 18th\r\nthe Earl of Worcester, Edward's constable and minister of his\r\ncruelties,(927) was beheaded on Tower Hill, the ground being kept by the\r\nSheriffs of London and a contingent from the several wards.(928)\r\n\r\n(M500)\r\n\r\nIn November Henry was made to hold a parliament, and Sir Thomas Cooke, the\r\ndeposed alderman, lost no time in presenting a bill for the restoration of\r\nhis lands, which had been seized by the queen's father, Lord Rivers. He\r\nwould probably have been successful had fortune continued to favour King\r\nHenry, for, besides being a member of parliament, he was, writes Fabyan (a\r\nbrother alderman), \"a man of great boldnesse in speche, and well spoken\r\nand syngulerly wytted and well reasoned.\"(929) John Stokton had recently\r\nbeen elected mayor, but there is reason for believing that he, like other\r\naldermen, preferred Edward on the throne, licentious and extravagant as he\r\nwas, to an imbecile like Henry. He fell ill, or, as Fabyan puts it,\r\nfeigned sickness and took to his bed, and Cooke assumed the duties of the\r\nmayoralty. At Edward's restoration Cooke had to seek refuge in France, but\r\nhe was taken at sea before he could reach the continent. The same fate\r\nmight have awaited Stokton had he shown himself less cautious at that\r\ncritical time.\r\n\r\n(M501)\r\n\r\nThat the aldermen and the better class of citizens favoured Edward, is\r\nshown by the ease with which he effected an entry into the city when he\r\nreturned to England in the spring of the following year (1471). The gates,\r\nwe are told, were opened to him by Urswyk, the Recorder, and certain\r\naldermen (their names are not mentioned), who took advantage of the\r\ninhabitants being at dinner to let in Edward.(930) Two days later, having\r\nrecruited his forces, Edward marched out of the city, with Henry in his\r\ntrain, to meet Warwick. He encountered him on Easter Day (14 April) at\r\nBarnet, and totally defeated him, both the earl and his brother being left\r\ndead on the field. By this time Margaret had landed with a fresh army; but\r\na crushing defeat inflicted upon her at Tewkesbury (4 May) left Edward\r\nonce more master of the kingdom.\r\n\r\n(M502) (M503)\r\n\r\nFor a short time the city lay in some peril whilst Edward was engaged with\r\nWarwick and Margaret. The men of Kent again became troublesome. They\r\naffected not to believe that Warwick had actually fallen at Barnet. Under\r\nthe leadership of Thomas Fauconberg or Falconbridge, generally spoken of\r\nas the \"bastard,\" being a natural son of William Nevill, first Lord\r\nFauconberg, Earl of Kent, they marched to London, with the intention of\r\nreleasing Henry from confinement and placing him again on the throne.\r\nFauconberg, who had been made a freeman of the City in 1454,(931) assumed\r\nthe title of captain of King Henry's people in Kent, and on the 8th May\r\nwrote from Sittingbourne to inform the inhabitants of the city that he had\r\nundertaken the cause of Henry against the \"usurper\" Edward, and to ask to\r\nbe allowed to pass through the city with his followers, whom he promised\r\nto hold in restraint and prevent doing any mischief. He had written to the\r\nmayor and aldermen to the same effect, and had desired to have a reply\r\nsent to him at Blackheath by a certain day and hour. To this letter the\r\nmayor and aldermen sent an answer on the following day, to the effect that\r\nwhen Edward left the city, after the battle of Barnet, to follow the\r\nmovements of Margaret and endeavour to bring about an action before she\r\ncould completely rally her forces, he had charged them on their allegiance\r\nto hold the city of London for him, and for none other. For that reason\r\nthey dared not, neither would they, suffer him to pass through the city.\r\nThey hesitated to accept his assurance as to the peaceable behaviour of\r\nhis followers, judging from past experience. As for the statement he had\r\ncaused to be published, that he held a commission as captain of the Navy\r\nof England and men of war by sea and land under the Earl of Warwick, whom\r\nhe still supposed to be alive, they assured him that the earl was dead,\r\nand that his corpse, as well as the corpse of Montague, the earl's\r\nbrother, had been exposed to view for two days in St. Paul's. They gave\r\nhim the names of some of the chief men who had fallen at Tewkesbury,\r\nobtained, they assured him, not from hearsay but from\r\neye-witnesses--special war correspondents, whom the City had despatched for\r\nthe express purpose of reporting on the state of the field, and they\r\nconcluded by exhorting him to do as they themselves had done, and to\r\nacknowledge Edward IV as the rightful king. They would even plead for\r\nroyal favour on his behalf, but as to letting him and his host pass\r\nthrough the city, that was out of the question.(932) Having despatched\r\nthis answer to Fauconberg, the civic fathers at once set to work to\r\nfortify the river's bank from Castle Baynard to the Tower, where lay the\r\nrebels' fleet. On Sunday, the 12th May, the Kentish men tried to force\r\nLondon Bridge and set fire to some beer-houses near Saint Katherine's\r\nHospital. The attack was renewed on the following Tuesday, whilst portions\r\nof the rebel force, amounting it was said to 5,000 persons, were told off\r\nto try and force the gates of Aldgate and Bishopsgate. There, however,\r\nthey were repulsed, and nearly 300 of them met their death, either in\r\nactual fight or in their endeavours to get on board their boats at\r\nBlackwall. Urswyk, the city's Recorder, as well as Robert Basset, alderman\r\nof Aldgate Ward, showed conspicuous valour in the fight which took place\r\nin that quarter.(933) The city was never again troubled by Fauconberg.\r\nAfter much wandering he was taken prisoner at Southampton, and thence\r\nconveyed to Middleham, in Yorkshire, where he was beheaded. His head was\r\nafterwards sent to London and set up on London Bridge, \"looking into\r\nKentward.\"(934)\r\n\r\n(M504)\r\n\r\nOn the night after Edward's return(935) in triumph to London, Henry VI\r\nended his life in the Tower, murdered, in all probability, at the instance\r\nof the Duke of Gloucester, the king's brother, afterwards King Richard\r\nIII. His remains lay in state at St. Paul's and at the Blackfriars a short\r\nwhile, and were then carried to Chertsey to be buried.(936) Edward\r\ndistributed honours among his supporters in the city with a lavish hand.\r\nNot only did the Lord Mayor--the cautious Stokton--receive the honour of\r\nknighthood, but the aldermen(937) besides, whilst the city's doughty\r\nRecorder was soon afterwards raised to be Baron of the Exchequer. The City\r\nwas so pleased with its Recorder that it voted him a pipe of wine\r\nannually, but the gift was not to be drawn into precedent.(938)\r\n\r\n(M505)\r\n\r\nThe rest of Edward's reign was undisturbed by any attempt to unseat the\r\nnew dynasty, and his position was rendered the more secure by the birth of\r\na son (afterwards Edward V) in the sanctuary of Westminster, whither his\r\nwife Elizabeth had fled for refuge. Before the young Prince of Wales was\r\nfive years old he received the honour of knighthood at Westminster. The\r\nmayor and aldermen went to meet him on his way from the city to\r\nWestminster on that occasion, clad in scarlet robes, whilst the streets\r\nfrom Bishopsgate to Saint Paul's were thronged with the commons in their\r\nlivery.(939)\r\n\r\n(M506)\r\n\r\nEdward was now free to carry out his foreign policy. Parliament voted\r\nsupplies to enable him to make war with France, but these were not\r\nsufficient, and he had recourse to a system of \"benevolences\" or free\r\ngifts, which few, however, dared to refuse. On the 30th May, 1475, he left\r\nthe Bishop of London's palace in St. Paul's Church-yard, and, passing\r\nthrough Cheapside to London Bridge, took boat to Greenwich for the purpose\r\nof crossing over to France. The livery companies turned out to do him\r\nhonour.(940) The expedition ended without a blow, Edward allowing himself\r\nto be bought off with a sum of 75,000 crowns paid down and a pension of\r\n50,000 more. On his return he was met at Blackheath by the mayor and\r\naldermen in scarlet gowns, with their servants in gowns of\r\n\"musterdevilers,\" accompanied by more than 600 members of the companies in\r\ngowns of bright murrey.(941)\r\n\r\n(M507)\r\n\r\nBy resorting again to benevolences and exacting money from the City in\r\nreturn for charters, Edward avoided the necessity of summoning parliament\r\nbetween the years 1478 and 1483. On the 25th May, 1481, the king granted\r\nthe City a general pardon,(942) and in the following month the City\r\nreturned the compliment by a loan of 5,000 marks.(943) This loan was not\r\nonly repaid, but the king in the next year extended his hospitality to the\r\nCity by giving a large number of citizens a day's hunting in Waltham\r\nforest, and afterwards regaling them and their wives with venison and\r\nwine.(944)\r\n\r\n(M508)\r\n\r\nThe close of the year 1482 witnessed such a dearth of cereals that the\r\nexportation of wheat or other grain was absolutely forbidden. It was\r\nfeared that a famine might arise in the City of London, so vast had its\r\npopulation become, both from the influx of nobles who had taken up their\r\nquarters within its walls as well as of strangers from foreign lands.\r\nMerchants were therefore encouraged to send their grain to London by a\r\npromise that it should not be intercepted by the king's purveyors.(945)\r\n\r\n(M509)\r\n\r\nThe names of the City's representatives who attended the parliament which\r\nmet in January, 1483, are not recorded, but we have the names of four\r\naldermen and five commoners, who were appointed in the previous month of\r\nDecember to confer with the City members on matters affecting the\r\nCity.(946) In addition to parliamentary grants of a fifteenth and tenth,\r\nand a renewal of the tax on aliens, the citizens agreed to lend the king\r\nthe sum of L2,000, each alderman to lay down 50 marks and 80 commoners to\r\nsubscribe L15 a piece.(947) Some difficulty was experienced in raising the\r\nmoney, and the names of eleven persons who had refused to contribute were\r\nforwarded to the king.(948) A little more than a month elapsed and Edward\r\nwas dead.\r\n\r\n(M510)\r\n\r\nThe coronation of the young prince who now succeeded to his father's\r\nthrone, only to occupy it however for a few weeks, was fixed to take place\r\non the first Sunday in May; and on the 19th April the City was busy making\r\narrangements for the prince's reception. It was decided that the mayor and\r\naldermen should ride forth to meet the king, clad in gowns of scarlet,\r\ntheir attendants being provided with gowns of the colour of lion's-foot\r\n(_pied de lyon_), at the public cost. Five sergeants-at-mace belonging to\r\nthe mayor, and nineteen sergeants-at-mace in the service of the sheriffs,\r\nwere also to ride out to meet the king, clad in gowns of the\r\nlast-mentioned colour. The sword-bearer was to be provided with a gown of\r\nmurrey, and a deputation from the civic guilds, to the number of 410\r\npersons, clad in gowns of the same colour, was to join the cavalcade.(949)\r\nOn the 14th May they rode out to Hornsey, where they met the prince and\r\nhis uncle, the Duke of Gloucester, and escorted them to the city. The duke\r\nwas the same day appointed Protector, to the great disappointment of the\r\nqueen, who again took sanctuary at Westminster. She was induced shortly\r\nafterwards to give up possession of her younger son, the Duke of York, and\r\nhe and Prince Edward were lodged in the Tower by order of Gloucester, who\r\ntook up his quarters at Crosby Palace, the mansion house of Sir John\r\nCrosby, in Bishopsgate Street.\r\n\r\nAlthough preparations had been made for the coronation, and the City had\r\nappointed representatives from the livery companies to assist the chief\r\nbutler at the banquet(950) according to custom, that ceremony never took\r\nplace. Gloucester feared that if once the young king was crowned, the\r\nproject which he had already begun to entertain of transferring the crown\r\nto his own head would be less capable of realization. Although he took an\r\noath of allegiance to the new king,(951) it was not long before he\r\ndetermined to feel the pulse of the citizens as to their feelings towards\r\nhimself as a claimant of the crown.\r\n\r\n(M511)\r\n\r\nIn order to do this he called to his assistance Dr. Shaw, an eminent\r\npreacher, whose brother, Sir Edmund Shaa, or Shaw, happened to be mayor at\r\nthe time. Acting upon instructions from Gloucester, Shaw preached a sermon\r\nat Paul's Cross on Sunday, the 22nd June (1483), in which he charged the\r\nlate king with bigamy, Edward IV having, as he declared, made a contract\r\nof marriage with one of his mistresses before he married Elizabeth\r\nWoodville, and this being the case the late king's children by her were\r\nillegitimate, and Gloucester was the rightful heir to the throne. It was\r\narranged that at this point in his discourse Gloucester himself should\r\nappear on the scene, coming up, as if by chance, from his lodgings at\r\nCastle Baynard. By some mischance the duke failed to appear at the proper\r\nmoment, and the effect was lost. The citizens sat stolidly silent, not a\r\nsingle cry being raised in favour of Gloucester.\r\n\r\n(M512)\r\n\r\nNothing daunted by this dismal failure, Gloucester made another and more\r\nsuccessful attempt to win over the citizens. On the following Tuesday (24\r\nJune) he sent the Duke of Buckingham to harangue the citizens at the\r\nGuildhall. The duke began by reminding his hearers of the danger to which\r\ntheir wives and daughters had been exposed under the late king; of the\r\nundue influence exercised at court by Jane Shore,(952) one only of a\r\nnumber of respectable women whom Edward, he said, had seduced; of the\r\nexcessive taxes and illegal extortions by way of \"benevolences\" they had\r\nrecently suffered, and of the cruel treatment of their own alderman,\r\nCooke. He then went on to repeat the remarks of Dr. Shaw touching the\r\nillegitimacy of the princes, and spoke of the dangers of having a boy king\r\non the throne, concluding by saying that although it were doubtful if\r\nGloucester would accept the crown if asked, he would certainly be greatly\r\ninfluenced by any request proceeding from the \"worshipful citizens of the\r\nmetropolis of the kingdom.\"(953) Buckingham's eloquence was lost on the\r\ncitizens, who were as little influenced by what their new Recorder, Thomas\r\nFitz-William, had to say on the matter. At length the duke lost patience\r\nand plainly told them that the matter lay entirely with the lords and\r\ncommons, and that the assent of the citizens, however desirable in itself,\r\nwas not a necessity. By this time the back of the hall was packed with\r\nGloucester's partisans, so that when Buckingham put the question pointedly\r\nto the assembly--would they have the Protector assume the crown?--a cry of\r\nassent arose from this quarter and was taken up by a few lads and\r\napprentices. This was enough; the voice of the few was accepted as the\r\nvoice of the many, and the citizens were bidden to attend on the morrow to\r\npetition Gloucester to accept the crown.\r\n\r\n(M513)\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on the morrow, a deputation from the city waited on the Duke\r\nof Gloucester at Baynard's Castle and invited him to accept the crown.\r\nAfter a considerable show of affected reluctance, Richard assented, and,\r\nhaving assented, lost no time in carrying out his pre-conceived purpose.\r\nThe very next day he hastened to Westminster and, seating himself on the\r\nthrone, declared himself king by inheritance and election.\r\n\r\n(M514)\r\n\r\nOn the 6th July the last Angevin king that reigned over England was\r\ncrowned--crowned with his wife Anne, widow of Prince Edward, killed at\r\nTewkesbury, but after the battle not in it, and of whose blood Richard\r\nhimself is thought to have been guilty. The City accepted the position and\r\nmade the new king and queen a present of L1,000; two-thirds for the king\r\nand the remainder for the queen. The money was raised in the city by way\r\nof a fifteenth; the poor were not to be called upon to contribute, and the\r\ngift was not to form a precedent.(954) The claim of the mayor and citizens\r\nto assist the chief butler at the coronation banquet was made and\r\nallowed,(955) the king, sitting crowned in _le Whitehawle_, presented to\r\nthe mayor and aldermen who were present on that occasion a gold cup set\r\nwith pearls and precious stones, to be used by the commonalty at public\r\nentertainments in the Guildhall.(956) Concerning this cup there is the\r\nfollowing curious entry made in the City's Records, under date 13th July,\r\n1486, when Hugh Brice was mayor:--(957)\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Item it is aggreed this day by the Court that where Hugh Brice\r\n    Mair of this Citie, hathe in his Kepyng a Cuppe of gold, garneised\r\n    with perle and precious stone of the gifte of Richard, late in\r\n    dede and not of right, Kyng of Englond, which gifte was to thuse\r\n    of the Cominaltie of the said Citee, that if the saide Cuppe be\r\n    stolen or taken away by thevys oute of his possession, or elles by\r\n    the casualtie of Fire hereafter it shall hapne the same Cuppe to\r\n    be brent or lost, that the same Hugh Brice hereafter shall not be\r\n    hurt or impeched therfore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis extract is interesting as showing that the coronation cup presented\r\nto the mayor of the City by way of _honorarium_ was, at this period at\r\nleast, looked upon as a gift made to the City's use, and that the mayor\r\ncould not claim it as his own perquisite, as mayors had been in the habit\r\nof doing in days gone by, and as they continued to do afterwards. William\r\nEstfeld, who, as mayor, attended the coronation of Henry VI (6 Nov.,\r\n1429), and received the customary gold cup and ewer, appropriated the gift\r\nto his own use, and, as we have already mentioned, bequeathed them to his\r\ngrandson.\r\n\r\n(M515) (M516)\r\n\r\nRichard had scarcely been seated three months on the throne before the\r\nDuke of Buckingham, who had been rewarded for his late services by being\r\nappointed lord high constable, was in open rebellion, and Henry, Earl of\r\nRichmond, long an exile in France, was meditating an invasion.\r\nBuckingham's conspiracy proved a failure, and he paid for his rashness\r\nwith his head. The Earl of Richmond was detained in France by stress of\r\nweather, and danger from that quarter was averted at least for a time.\r\n\r\n(M517) (M518)\r\n\r\nOn Richard's return to London after putting down his enemies, he was\r\nwelcomed by over 400 members of the various civic companies, who rode out\r\nto meet him in gowns of murrey.(958) His policy was one of conciliation,\r\nand he lent a ready ear to a Petition which the citizens presented to him\r\nsetting forth the wrongs which they had suffered: \"We be determined\" said\r\nthe citizens in forcible language, \"rather to adventure and to commit us\r\nto the peril of our lives and jeopardy of death, than to live in such\r\nthraldom and bondage as we have lived some time heretofore, oppressed and\r\ninjured by extortions and new impositions against the laws of God and man,\r\nand the liberty and laws of this realm wherein every Englishman is\r\ninherited.\"(959)\r\n\r\n(M519)\r\n\r\nRichard met this appeal by summoning parliament to meet in January (1484),\r\nwhen various acts were passed affecting the trade and commerce of the city\r\nand the country, and among them one which forbade aliens keeping any\r\nforeign apprentices or workpeople to assist them in their occupation, and\r\notherwise imposed great restrictions upon the merchant stranger.(960) This\r\nstatute was scarcely less welcome to the citizens of London than that\r\nwhich declared the practice of exacting money under the guise of\r\nbenevolences to be unconstitutional.(961)\r\n\r\n(M520)\r\n\r\nIn the summer he was welcomed wherever he went, yet he knew that danger\r\nthreatened. Richmond was preparing for an invasion and the nobles were not\r\nto be trusted. The citizens, too, were aware of the danger, and had in the\r\nearly part of the year appointed a joint committee of aldermen and\r\ncommoners to survey the city's ordnance, and to supply guns and gunpowder\r\nin place of that which had recently been destroyed by a fire.(962) In\r\nAugust they had promised Richard a loan of L2,400, each alderman\r\ncontributing L100;(963) and in the following November the mayor and\r\naldermen rode out to Kennington to meet him and escort him to the\r\nWardrobe, near Blackfriars.(964)\r\n\r\n(M521)\r\n\r\nMatters became more serious as time went on. In June, 1485, the City\r\nadvanced another sum of L2,000 to assist Richard against the \"rebels,\" who\r\nwere daily expected to land in England.(965) Extraordinary precautions\r\nwere taken to guard the city.(966) At last the blow fell. On the 7th\r\nAugust Henry landed at Milford Haven, and on the 22nd the battle of\r\nBosworth was fought and Richard killed.\r\n\r\n(M522)\r\n\r\nFrom Bosworth field Henry set out for London. He was met at Shoreditch by\r\na deputation from the City, accompanied by the Recorder, and was presented\r\nwith a gift of 1,000 marks.(967) The standards taken on the field of\r\nbattle were deposited with much pomp and ceremony in St. Paul's Church,\r\nwhere a _Te Deum_ was sung, and for a few days Henry took up his residence\r\nin the bishop's palace in St. Paul's Churchyard.(968)\r\n\r\n(M523)\r\n\r\nA cloud soon overshadowed the rejoicings which followed Henry's accession.\r\nAn epidemic hitherto unknown in England, although visitations of it\r\nfollowed at intervals during this and the succeeding reign, made its\r\nappearance in the city towards the close of September. The \"sweating\r\nsickness,\" as this deadly pestilence was called, carried off two mayors\r\nand six aldermen within the space of a week(969)--so sudden and fatal was\r\nits attack. Sir Thomas Hille, who was mayor at the time of its first\r\nappearance, fell a victim to it on the 23rd September, and was succeeded\r\nby William Stocker, appointed on the following day.(970) Within four days\r\nStocker himself was dead. There remained little more than a month before\r\nthe regular day of election of a mayor (28 Oct.)(971) for the year\r\nensuing, and John Warde was called upon to take office during the\r\ninterval.(972) He appears to have entertained but little affection for the\r\ncity, and the civic authorities had some difficulty in getting him to\r\nreside in London,(973) where his duties required his presence. When the\r\nmayoralty year expired he was not put in nomination for re-election. He\r\nprobably went back into the country, glad to get away from the\r\npestilential city, and Hugh Brice was elected in his stead.(974)\r\nFortunately for the city, the epidemic departed as suddenly and\r\nunexpectedly as it came. By the end of October it had entirely\r\ndisappeared, and allowed of Henry's coronation taking place on the 30th of\r\nthat month.\r\n\r\n(M524)\r\n\r\nWithin a fortnight of his arrival in London Henry issued a writ of summons\r\nfor his first parliament. It was not so much for the purpose of obtaining\r\nsupplies that he was anxious that parliament should meet at the earliest\r\nopportunity; he was desirous of obtaining as soon as possible a\r\nparliamentary title to the crown. As for his immediate necessities, he\r\npreferred to apply to the City. He asked for a loan of 6,000 marks, or\r\nL4,000; but the citizens would not advance more than half that sum. The\r\nloan was repaid the following year--\"every penie to the good contentation\r\nand satisfying of them that disbursed it.\"(975)\r\n\r\n(M525)\r\n\r\nIn January, 1486, Henry married the Princess Elizabeth, daughter of Edward\r\nIV, and heiress of the Yorkist family. He had previously taken the\r\nprecaution of committing to the Tower the Earl of Warwick, son of\r\nClarence, for fear lest he might set up a title to the crown.(976) After\r\nhis marriage he set out on a progress through the country, and on his\r\nreturn to London, in June, was met by the mayor and citizens at Putney,\r\nand escorted by them down the river to Westminster.(977)\r\n\r\n(M526) (M527)\r\n\r\nA rumour that the Earl of Warwick had escaped from the Tower gave an\r\nopportunity for an imposter, Lambert Simnel, to personate the earl. In\r\norder to satisfy the Londoners that the rumour of Warwick's escape was a\r\nfabrication, Henry caused his prisoner to be paraded through the streets\r\nof the city, and exposed to public view at St. Paul's. After Simnel's\r\ndefeat (16 June, 1487), the Common Council agreed (28 June) to send a\r\ndeputation, consisting of two aldermen, the recorder, and four commoners,\r\nwith a suite of 24 men, to meet the king at Kenilworth, and at the same\r\ntime voted the king a present of L1000.(978) This gift was quickly\r\nfollowed (11 July) by the grant of another loan of L2,000 to be levied on\r\nthe civic companies as before.(979)\r\n\r\n(M528) (M529)\r\n\r\nIn October Henry was expected in London,(980) and the Common Council again\r\nshowed their loyalty by agreeing that the mayor and aldermen should ride\r\nforth to meet his highness, clad in cloaks of scarlet, and accompanied by\r\na suite of servants clothed in medley, at the cost of the \"Chamber.\" With\r\nthem also rode a contingent from the various civic guilds, clothed in\r\nviolet, and numbering over 400 horsemen. The Mercers, the Grocers, the\r\nDrapers, the Fishmongers, and the \"Taillours,\" each sent 30 mounted\r\nrepresentatives of their guild; the Goldsmiths sent 24, whilst the rest\r\nsent contingents varying from one to twenty.(981) On the occasion of the\r\nqueen's coronation, which took place the following month (25 Nov.), she\r\nwas made the recipient of a gift of 1,000 marks by the City.(982)\r\n\r\n(M530)\r\n\r\nThe king would willingly have remained at peace if he were allowed, from\r\nmotives of economy if for no other reason. England, however, could not sit\r\nstill and see Brittany overwhelmed by the French king. Before assistance\r\ncould be sent to the Duchess Anne, it was imperative that money should be\r\nraised. At the close of 1488 the Common Council voted the king a loan of\r\nL4,000. The money was ordered to be raised by assessment on the companies,\r\nbut the practice was not to be drawn into precedent. The king, like a good\r\npaymaster as he always was, whatever other defects he may have had, repaid\r\nthe money in the following year.(983)\r\n\r\n(M531)\r\n\r\nEarly in the following year parliament(984) granted large supplies which\r\nenabled Henry to despatch 6,000 Englishmen to Anne's assistance, but which\r\ncaused much discontent among the \"rude and beastlie\" people of Yorkshire\r\nand Durham.(985) In June, 1491, another loan of L3,000 was raised, this\r\ntime by assessment on the wards;(986) and in October Henry declared to\r\nparliament his intention of invading France in person. A grant of two\r\nfifteenths and two tenths was immediately made to assist him in his\r\nexpedition by parliament; whilst the City contributed a \"great\r\nbenevolence,\" the fellowship of Drapers contributing more than any other\r\nfellowship, and every alderman subscribing, whether he wished it or no,\r\nthe sum of L200. The amount contributed by the commonalty exceeded\r\nL9,000.(987) Thus furnished with supplies, the king crossed over to Calais\r\non the 6th October, 1492. The campaign, however, had scarcely opened\r\nbefore Henry gladly accepted the liberal terms offered him by the French\r\nking, and peace was signed at Etaples (3 Nov.).\r\n\r\n(M532)\r\n\r\nThe success which, brief as it was, had attended Simnel's enterprise was\r\nsufficient to encourage a hope that a better planned project might end in\r\noverturning the throne. A report was accordingly blazed abroad that\r\nRichard, Duke of York, brother of King Edward V, was yet alive, not having\r\nbeen murdered in the Tower, as had been supposed; and a man called Perkin\r\nWarbeck or Warboys, a native of Tournay, assumed the name of Richard\r\nPlantagenet and succeeded in getting a large number of people in Ireland\r\nand Scotland to believe that in his person they in fact saw Richard, Duke\r\nof York, the rightful heir to the crown. James IV of Scotland not only\r\ngave him in marriage the lady Catherine Gordon, daughter of the Earl of\r\nHuntley, but led an army into England in hopes that the appearance of the\r\npretended prince might raise an insurrection in the northern counties.\r\nInstead, however, of joining the invaders the English prepared to repel\r\nthem, and James retreated into his own country. This took place in 1496.\r\nParliament granted large supplies to enable the king to meet the danger,\r\nbut the inhabitants of Cornwall, sick of the constant demands made of them\r\nfor money, and aware of the large treasure which Henry had already\r\namassed, openly resisted any attempt at further taxation and determined to\r\nmarch on London.\r\n\r\n(M533)\r\n\r\nThe Londoners, who not only abstained from opposing the new demand for\r\nmoney, but volunteered a loan to the king (15 Nov.) of L4,000,(988) lost\r\nno time in putting their city into a state of defence. Six aldermen and a\r\nnumber of representatives from the livery companies were deputed to attend\r\nto the city's ordnance.(989) The mayor was to be allowed twelve armed men\r\nin addition to his usual suite, and the sheriffs forty sergeants and forty\r\nvalets in order to assist them in keeping the peace within the city.\r\nCommunication was to be kept up at least once in the day between the mayor\r\nand the Lord Chancellor. Houses which had been set up on the city's walls,\r\nor within sixteen feet of them, were to be abated. John Stokker, who\r\nfilled the not unworthy office of Common Hunt,(990) was ordered daily to\r\nride out to learn the king's pleasure and report thereon to the mayor and\r\naldermen. Among those appointed to guard the city's gates and Temple Bar\r\nwas Alderman Fabyan, the chronicler.(991) The state of anxiety which\r\nprevailed in the city at this crisis is illustrated by \"Jesus Mercy\" at\r\nthe head of one side of the page of the City's record, on which the above\r\norders are entered, whilst on the other side are the words _vigilie\r\ntemporis turbacionis_.(992)\r\n\r\n(M534) (M535) (M536) (M537)\r\n\r\nBy the 22nd June, 1497, all immediate danger had passed, the rebels being\r\non that day utterly defeated at Blackheath. Their leaders were taken and\r\nexecuted; the rest were for the most part made prisoners, but were soon\r\nafterwards dismissed without further punishment. The leniency displayed\r\ntowards them by Henry was ill-repaid by their afterwards flocking to the\r\nstandard of the _soi-disant_ Richard IV, King of England, who availed\r\nhimself of their mutinous disposition and appeared in their midst at\r\nBodmin. The news of Perkin Warbeck having arrived in Cornwall from Ireland\r\nwas brought to the mayor and aldermen of the City of London by letter from\r\nthe king, which was read to the Common Council on Saturday, the 16th\r\nSeptember.(993) The rebels made an unsuccesful attempt to get possession\r\nof Exeter, but hearing of the approach of the king's forces, Perkin\r\nWarbeck withdrew to Taunton, leaving his followers to take care of\r\nthemselves. From Taunton he went to \"Mynet\" (Minehead) accompanied by less\r\nthan sixty adherents,(994) and by the 12th October the king was able to\r\ninform the Mayor that Peter \"Warboys\" had voluntarily submitted himself\r\nand had confessed to his being a native of Tournay.(995) The king had him\r\nconveyed to London and paraded through the streets on horseback, in a\r\nspecies of mock triumph, and caused his confession to be printed and\r\nscattered over the country that people might see the real character of the\r\nman. For a time he appears to have been detained in lax custody about the\r\ncourt, but after he had made an attempt to escape and reach the sea-coast,\r\nand been re-captured, he was sent to the Tower. There he got into\r\ncommunication with the unfortunate Earl of Warwick, and entered into a\r\nplot for effecting his own and the earl's liberty. A charge was formulated\r\nagainst the earl on the most trivial grounds, of a conspiracy to seize the\r\nTower, and Warbeck was indicted as an accomplice. The former, being found\r\nguilty by his peers, was beheaded on Tower Hill, while Perkin and three of\r\nhis accomplices were hanged at Tyburn.(996)\r\n\r\n(M538)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Prince Henry, who afterwards succeeded his father on the\r\nthrone as King Henry VIII, but was at the time a child of seven years,\r\npaid a visit to the city (30 Oct., 1498), where he received a hearty\r\nwelcome and was presented by the Recorder, on behalf of the citizens, with\r\na pair of gilt goblets. In reply to the Recorder, who in presenting this\r\n\"litell and powre\" gift, promised to remember his grace with a better at\r\nsome future time, the prince made the following short speech:--(997)\r\n\r\n(M539)\r\n\r\n\r\n    _\"Fader Maire, I thank you and your Brethern here present of this\r\n    greate and kynd remembraunce which I trist in tyme comyng to\r\n    deserve. And for asmoche as I can not give unto you according\r\n    thankes, I shall pray the Kynges Grace to thank you, and for my\r\n    partye I shall not forget yo__r__ kyndnesse.\"_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn anticipation of the prince's visit, a proclamation had been made by the\r\ncivic authorities with the view of purging the city of infectious disease,\r\nto the effect that all vagabonds and others affected with the \"greate\r\npockes\" should vacate the city on pain of imprisonment.(998)\r\n\r\n(M540) (M541)\r\n\r\nThe removal of Warwick--\"the one judicial murder of Henry's reign\"--if not\r\nsuggested by Spain, was an act which could not be otherwise than grateful\r\nto the Spanish king. For five years past negotiations had been proceeding\r\nfor a marriage between Prince Arthur and Catherine of Aragon. Warwick's\r\ndeath cleared away the last of Henry's serious competitors, and \"not a\r\ndoubtful drop of royal blood\" remained in the kingdom to oppose Arthur's\r\nclaim to the succession. The princess was expected shortly to arrive in\r\nEngland, and a committee composed of aldermen and commoners was appointed\r\n(Nov. 1499) to consult with the king's commissioners as to the\r\npreparations to be made for her reception.(999) Nearly two years, however,\r\nelapsed before she set foot in England. In May, 1500, there were again\r\nrumours of her approach, and the Common Council voted a sum of money to be\r\nlevied on the wards to defray the expenses of her reception.(1000)\r\n\r\n(M542)\r\n\r\nThe \"garnysshyng of the pagents\" for the festive occasion(1001) was\r\ninterrupted by the death of Edmund, the king's infant son. On the 19th\r\nJune the members of the various craft guilds were ordered to line the\r\nstreets of Old Bailey and Fleet Street, through which the funeral\r\nprocession was to pass on its way to Westminster. The mayor and aldermen\r\nwere to stand, clad in their violet gowns, near Saint Dunstan's Church,\r\nand the next morning to go to Westminster by barge to attend the solemn\r\nrequiem.(1002)\r\n\r\n(M543)\r\n\r\nThere was no necessity for hurry in regard to the pageants. More than a\r\ntwelvemonth was yet to elapse before they were wanted. At length--on the\r\n2nd October,(1003) 1501--the princess landed at Plymouth, and five days\r\nlater the City received notice from the king of her approach to London.\r\nThe marriage was solemnized at St. Paul's on the 14th November, the\r\nprincess being presented with silver flagons by the City in honour of the\r\noccasion.(1004) Five months later (2 April, 1502) the bride was a widow,\r\nPrince Arthur having died at the early age of fifteen.\r\n\r\n(M544)\r\n\r\nIn 1503 the streets of the city were again put into mourning, for in\r\nFebruary of that year Henry lost his queen. A long account of the manner\r\nof \"receyvyng of the corps of the most noble princes Quene Elizabeth\" is\r\ngiven in the City's Archives.(1005) In the following month the streets\r\npresented a very different appearance, the occasion being the\r\nsolemnization of the league made between Henry and the King of the Romans.\r\nBonfires were ordered to be lighted at nine different places, and at each\r\nof them was to be placed a hogshead of wine, with two sergeants and two\r\nsheriffs' yeomen to prevent disturbance; but seeing that it was the Lenten\r\nseason and that the queen had so recently died, there was to be no\r\nminstrelsy. The City Chamberlain was instructed to provide a certain\r\nquantity of \"Ipocras,\" claret, Rhenish wine and Muscatel, besides comfits\r\nand wafers, and two pots of \"Succade\" and green ginger, to be presented on\r\nthe City's behalf to the ambassadors of the King of the Romans, lying at\r\n\"Pasmer Howse\"; a similar gift being presented the following day on behalf\r\nof the sheriffs.(1006)\r\n\r\n(M545)\r\n\r\nHenry's chief merit was that he established order, and for this the\r\ncitizens were grateful. This improvement on the weak government of his\r\nimmediate predecessors had only been carried out, however, at the cost of\r\nextension of royal power, and the City was made to suffer with the rest of\r\nthe kingdom. In 1503 the civic authorities were deprived by statute of\r\ntheir control over the livery companies,(1007) and in the same year the\r\nTailors of London obtained a charter which gave umbrage to the mayor and\r\naldermen of the City, as ousting them of their jurisdiction. The Tailors\r\nmaintained their independence, and their wardens are expressly mentioned\r\nas refusing to join the Mercers, Grocers, Drapers, Fishmongers, Goldsmiths\r\nand other fraternities in a petition to parliament (1512) for placing them\r\nformally under the rule of the mayor and aldermen, from which they were\r\nfrequently breaking away.(1008)\r\n\r\n(M546)\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1505 that the City succeeded in getting its charter(1009)\r\nfrom Henry, and then only on payment of the sum of 5,000 marks. The terms\r\nof the charter, moreover, were far from satisfactory, and an attempt was\r\nmade to get them altered and obtain an abatement of the fine,(1010) but to\r\nno purpose.\r\n\r\n(M547)\r\n\r\nHenry continued his high-handed policy towards the City up to the day of\r\nhis death, and thereby greatly increased his treasure. His chief\r\ninstruments were Empson and Dudley, who took up their residence in the\r\ncity, occupying two houses in Walbrook, whence each had a door into a\r\ngarden of the Earl of Oxford's house in St. Swithin's Lane.(1011) There\r\nthey used to meet and concert measures for filling the king's purse and\r\ntheir own. In 1506 Henry removed Robert Johnson, a goldsmith, from the\r\nshrievalty within three days of his election, and put William Fitz-William\r\nin his place. Johnson took the matter so much to heart that he died.(1012)\r\nIn the same year Thomas Kneseworth, the late mayor, was committed to the\r\nMarshalsea, together with the sheriffs who had served under him, and only\r\nregained his liberty on payment of a large sum of money.(1013) In 1507 Sir\r\nWilliam Capel, Alderman of Walbrook Ward, who had already fallen a victim\r\nto Empson and been heavily fined under an obsolete statute, was again\r\nattacked and fined L2,000 for supposed negligence during his mayoralty.\r\nRather than submit to such extortion he went to prison, and remained there\r\nuntil the king's death, when he obtained his freedom and was soon\r\nafterwards re-elected mayor.(1014) Lawrence Aylmer, another mayor, was\r\nalso a victim of Henry's tyranny, and was committed to the compter, where\r\nhe remained for the rest of the reign.(1015)\r\n\r\n(M548)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Archduke Philip happened to fall into Henry's hands\r\n(Jan., 1506). Whilst crossing the sea to claim the kingdom of Castile in\r\nright of his wife, he was driven by stress of weather into Weymouth. Henry\r\nwas too shrewd a politician not to make the most of so lucky an event, and\r\ndetained him in a species of honourable captivity, until Philip had\r\npromised him the hand of his sister Margaret with a large dower. This\r\nmarriage alliance was destined never to be realised. Another scheme,\r\nhowever, was subsequently proposed and met with more success. This was a\r\nmarriage of Henry's own daughter with Philip's son Charles, Prince of\r\nCastile. News of their engagement was conveyed to the mayor and aldermen\r\nof the City by a letter from the king himself (25 Dec., 1507), in which he\r\nexpatiated on the benefits, political and commercial, likely to arise from\r\nthe match.(1016)\r\n\r\nThis letter was followed by another from the king, dated from Greenwich,\r\nthe 23rd June following, in which the Corporation was informed that for\r\nthe assurance of execution of the marriage treaty both parties had given\r\npledges, and that the City of London was, among other cities and towns,\r\nincluded in letters obligatory to that effect, which letters he begged\r\nshould be sealed without delay with the Common Seal of the City.(1017) And\r\nso, after the manner of the times, the boy of eight was married (by proxy)\r\nto the girl of twelve, amid great rejoicings in London (17 Dec.,\r\n1508).(1018)\r\n\r\n(M549)\r\n\r\nIf Henry amassed wealth, it was not from any miserly motive. He well knew\r\nthe value of the money, and that peace at home was never better secured\r\nthan by a full treasury. He made, moreover, a princely use of his money,\r\nencouraging scholarship, music, and architecture, and dazzled the eyes of\r\nforeign ambassadors with the splendour of his receptions. That he had a\r\nfine taste in building no one can deny who has once seen the chapel of\r\nKing's College, Cambridge, or the chapel that bears his name at\r\nWestminster.\r\n\r\n(M550)\r\n\r\nOriginally intended by Henry as a resting place for the remains of his\r\nuncle, Henry VI, the last mentioned edifice was diverted from its purposes\r\nand became the chantry as well as the tomb of Henry VII himself. Anxiety\r\nfor his soul caused him to bind the Abbot of Westminster by heavy\r\npenalties to the due observance of his obit. These penalties were set out\r\nin six books or deeds, sealed with the Common Seal of the City of London,\r\nand formally delivered to the king by a deputation of the mayor and\r\naldermen, who received in return a seventh book to remain in their\r\ncustody. In 1504--the year that Pope Julius sanctioned the removal of the\r\nremains of Henry VI from Windsor to Westminster--the mayor and citizens\r\nformally sealed the \"books\" before the Master of the Rolls at the\r\nGuildhall. Two years later certain livery companies undertook to keep the\r\nking's obit on the day that the mayor for the time being went to take his\r\noath at the Exchequer.(1019)\r\n\r\n(M551)\r\n\r\nThe king died at his palace of Shene, recently renamed in his honour\r\n\"Richmond,\" on the 22nd April,(1020) 1509. Just before his death he\r\ngranted a general pardon and paid the debts of prisoners committed to the\r\ncompters of London and to Ludgate for debts amounting to forty shillings\r\nor less.(1021) His corpse was conveyed from Richmond to St. Paul's on the\r\n9th May, being met on its way at St. George's Bar, in Southwark, by the\r\nmayor, aldermen and a suite of 104 commoners, all in black clothing and\r\nall on horseback. The streets were lined with other members of the\r\ncompanies bearing torches, the lowest craft occupying the first place.\r\nNext after the freemen of the city came the \"strangers\"--Easterlings,\r\nFrenchmen, Spaniards, Venetians, Genoese, Florentines and \"Lukeners\"--on\r\nhorseback and on foot, also bearing torches.(1022) These took up their\r\nposition in Gracechurch Street. Cornhill was occupied by the lower crafts,\r\nordered in such a way that \"the most worshipful crafts\" stood next unto\r\n\"Paules.\" A similar order was preserved the next day, when the corpse was\r\nremoved from Saint Paul's to Westminster. The lowest crafts were placed\r\nnearest to the Cathedral, and the most worshipful next to Temple Bar,\r\nwhere the civic escort terminated. The mayor and aldermen proceeded to\r\nWestminster by water, to attend the \"masse and offering.\" The mayor, with\r\nhis mace in his hand, made his offering next after the Lord Chamberlain;\r\nthose aldermen who had passed the chair(1023) offered next after the\r\nKnights of the Garter, and before all \"knights for the body\"; whilst the\r\naldermen who had not yet served as mayor made their offering after the\r\nknights.(1024)\r\n\r\nWhen King Henry VIII was about to make an expedition to France in 1544,\r\nthe Court of Aldermen gave notice to the Bishop of London that the obit of\r\nHenry VII would be kept on Friday, the 16th May, on which day there would\r\nbe a general procession, and that the observance would be continued until\r\nthe king departed out of the realm, and then on every Friday and Wednesday\r\nuntil his return.(1025)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(M552)\r\n\r\nOne of the first acts of the new king was to grant Letters Patent\r\nabsolving the City of all trespasses committed before the date of his\r\naccession,(1026) and to offer restitution to all who had suffered at the\r\nhands of Empson and Dudley or their agents. Empson and Dudley were\r\nthemselves committed to the Tower and afterwards executed. In the meantime\r\nan enquiry was opened in the city as to recent proceedings against Capel\r\nand others.\r\n\r\nIt was found that six men, whose names were John Derby, _alias_ Wright, a\r\nbowyer, Richard Smyth, a carpenter, William Sympson, a fuller, Henry\r\nStokton, a fishmonger, Thomas Yong, a saddler, and Robert Jakes, a\r\nshearman--all of whom had more than once been convicted of perjury, and on\r\nthat account been struck off inquests--had contrived to get themselves\r\nreplaced on the panel, and had been the chief movers in the recent actions\r\nagainst the late mayor and other officers of the city. They had, moreover,\r\ntaken bribes for concealment of offences of forestalling and regrating.\r\nBeing found guilty, on their own confession, of having brought false\r\ncharges against many of the aldermen, the Court of Common Council adjudged\r\nthe whole of the accused to be disfranchised. Three of them, who were\r\nfound more guilty than the rest, were sentenced to be taken from prison on\r\nthe next market day, on horseback, without saddles, and with their faces\r\nturned towards the horses' tails, to the pillory on Cornhill. There they\r\nwere to be set \"their heddes in the holys\" until proclamation of their\r\ncrime and sentence was read. The lesser offenders were spared the pillory,\r\nbut were condemned to attend on horseback at Cornhill, whence all the\r\noffenders were conducted to the Standard in Fleet Street \"by the most high\r\nways,\" where the proclamation was again read. The culprits were then taken\r\nback to prison and made to abjure the city on pain of imprisonment at the\r\npleasure of the mayor and aldermen.(1027) Among the charges brought\r\nagainst Derby was one to the effect that being on a jury he had received\r\nthe sum of ten shillings and \"a quarter of ffisshe for his howsehold,\" a\r\nbribe which a suitor had tendered by the advice and counsel of Thomas\r\nYong, saddler, who was apparently acting as Derby's accomplice.(1028)\r\n\r\n(M553)\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of the king's coronation, which took place on\r\nMidsummer-day soon after his marriage with Catherine of Aragon, his\r\nbrother's widow, the citizens presented the king and queen with the sum of\r\nL1,000 or 1,500 marks. Two-thirds of the gift was given expressly to the\r\nking, the remaining one-third being a tribute of respect to the queen. The\r\nmoney was to be raised in the city by way of a fifteenth, but the poor\r\nwere not to be assessed.(1029) The procession from the Tower to\r\nWestminster was equal to, if it did not surpass, any spectacle that had\r\nyet been witnessed in the city for its gorgeousness and pomp. The streets\r\nwere railed and barred from Gracechurch Street to Cheapside at the expense\r\nof the livery companies who lined the way,(1030)  \"beginning with base and\r\nmeane occupations and so ascending to the worshipful crafts.\" The\r\nGoldsmiths of London were especially conspicuous for their marks of\r\nloyalty on that day. Their stalls, which were situate by the Old Change at\r\nthe west end of Chepe, were occupied by fair maidens dressed in white and\r\nholding tapers of white wax, whilst priests in their robes stood by with\r\ncensers of silver and incensed the king and queen as they passed.(1031)\r\n\r\n(M554)\r\n\r\nAfter three years of indolent and luxurious ease Henry became embroiled in\r\ncontinental troubles. In 1511 a holy league had been formed for the\r\npurpose of driving the French out of the Milanese, and Henry's\r\nco-operation was desired. A parliament was summoned to meet early in the\r\nfollowing year.(1032) After granting supplies(1033) it unanimously agreed\r\nthat war should be proclaimed against France. The campaign of 1512 ended\r\ningloriously, and the French king threatened to turn the tables on Henry\r\nand to invade England. Henry rose to the occasion and at once set about\r\nstrengthening his navy. On the 30th January, 1513, he addressed a letter\r\nto the Corporation of London desiring them to furnish him with 300 men,\r\nthe same to be at Greenwich by the 15th February at the latest.(1034)\r\nProclamation was thereupon made in the city for all persons who were\r\nprepared to join the war to appear at the Guildhall any time before the\r\n10th February, where, if approved, they would be furnished with sufficient\r\nharness and weapons, without any charge, and also with sufficient wages at\r\nthe king's cost.(1035)\r\n\r\nThe city was suffering at the time from great scarcity of wheat, and each\r\nalderman was called upon to contribute the sum of L5 towards alleviating\r\nthe distress which prevailed. A contract was made with certain Hanse\r\nmerchants to furnish the city with 2,000 quarters of wheat and rye\r\nrespectively by Midsummer-day, whilst the royal purveyors were forbidden\r\nto lay hands on wheat, malt or grain entering the port of London.(1036)\r\nUnder the circumstances it could have been no great hardship, but rather\r\nan advantage to rid the city of 300 mouths. On the 1st February, 1513, the\r\naldermen were instructed to enquire in their respective wards as to the\r\nnumber of men each ward could furnish, and two days later the livery\r\ncompanies were ordered to find the sum of L300 to defray the expense\r\nconnected with fitting out the men. If more than L300 were needed they\r\nwere to draw on the Chamber, but any money not expended out of that sum\r\nwas to be paid into the Chamber.(1037) The companies raised the sum of\r\nL405, the Mercers contributing L35, the Grocers, Drapers, Fishmongers and\r\nGoldsmiths respectively L30, and the rest sums of smaller amount.(1038)\r\nThere was some difference of opinion as to the nature of the uniform to be\r\nworn by the city's contingent. At length it was settled that the soldiers'\r\ncoats should be white, with a St. George's cross and sword, together with\r\na rose, at the back and the same before. Their shoes were to be left to\r\nthe discretion of the muster-masters.(1039)\r\n\r\n(M555)\r\n\r\nHenry himself now crossed over to France. The campaign proved more\r\nsuccessful than the last, for the French being attacked at Guinegate, were\r\nseized with so great a panic that Henry achieved a bloodless victory. From\r\nthe hasty flight of the French cavalry, the engagement came to be known as\r\nthe Battle of Spurs. This victory secured the fall of Terouenne and was\r\nfollowed shortly afterwards by the capture of Tournay.\r\n\r\n(M556)\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these successes, however, Henry found it necessary to make\r\npeace in the following year. His allies had got what they wanted, and the\r\nconquest of France was as far off as ever. It remained only to make as\r\ngood a bargain as he could. The French king consented to the payment of a\r\nlarge sum of money, in return for which he was given Henry's sister Mary\r\nin marriage, although she was already affianced, if not married, to Prince\r\nCharles of Castile. This was the work of the king's new minister, Wolsey.\r\n\r\n(M557)\r\n\r\nTo the apostles of the New Learning--as the revival of letters which\r\ncommenced in the last reign came to be called--to Erasmus, to Archbishop\r\nWarham, to More and to Colet, the war at its outset had been eminently\r\ndistasteful. With the accession of Henry VIII to the throne they had hoped\r\nfor better things. War was to be for ever banished and a \"new order\" was\r\nto prevail.\r\n\r\n(M558)\r\n\r\nOf its connection with More and Colet the City is justly proud. At the\r\nopening of Henry's reign the future lord chancellor was executing the\r\nduties of the comparatively unimportant post of under-sheriff or judge of\r\nthe Poultry Compter, a post which he continued to hold until 1517.(1040)\r\nHe had received his education in the city at St. Antony's School in\r\nThreadneedle Street, a school which had already achieved a great\r\nreputation and afterwards reckoned among its pupils the famous Whitgift.\r\nLater in life he shut himself up for four years in the Charterhouse of\r\nLondon, living a life of devotion and prayer, but without taking any\r\nvow.(1041)\r\n\r\n(M559)\r\n\r\nThe father of John Colet, Dean of St. Paul's, had taken an active part in\r\nmunicipal life. Henry Colet had been alderman first of Farringdon Ward\r\nWithout and afterwards of the Wards of Castle Baynard and Cornhill,(1042)\r\nand as alderman of the last mentioned ward he had died towards the close\r\nof 1505. He had served as sheriff in 1477 and as mayor in 1486.\r\n\r\n(M560)\r\n\r\nUp to the time of Henry VI education had been carried on in the city\r\nchiefly by means of schools attached to the various city churches and\r\nreligious houses. By order of Henry VI, and at the instigation of four\r\ncity ministers,(1043) grammar schools were established in several\r\nparishes. The school of St. Antony attached to the hospital of the same\r\nname, of which Dr. John Carpenter was at the time master, received an\r\nendowment from Henry VI for the maintenance of scholars at Oxford. The\r\nschool continued to flourish some time after the dissolution of the\r\nhospital. There was also a school attached to the hospital of St. Thomas\r\nof Acon, as famous in its day as that of St. Antony, but of which little\r\nis known until after the suppression of the religious houses by Henry\r\nVIII, when it passed into the hands of the Mercers' Company and became\r\nknown, as it is to this day, as the Mercers' School.\r\n\r\n(M561)\r\n\r\nThe Dr. John Carpenter just mentioned must not be confounded with the Town\r\nClerk of that name, the compiler of the famous _Liber Albus_ and the\r\nfounder of the City of London School. There is little known of the\r\nfoundation of this latter school beyond the statement made by Stow a\r\ncentury and a-half later, that he \"gave tenements to the city for the\r\nfinding and bringing up of four poor men's children with meat, drink,\r\napparel, learning at the schools in the universities, etc., until they be\r\npreferred, and then others in their places for ever.\"(1044) Within the\r\nlast few years the City Chamberlain's accounts--touching \"the lands of Mr.\r\nJohn Carpenter, sometyme commen clarke of this cittie\"--have been brought\r\nto light, and serve to supplement in a small way Stow's meagre but\r\nvaluable statement. The rental or amount with which the Chamberlain\r\ncharged himself for the year 1565 or 1566 is there set down as L41 0_s._\r\n4_d._, and the discharge--embracing a quit rent due to the Dean and Chapter\r\nof Westminster, and expenses incurred in overseeing, clothing and feeding\r\nfour poor children \"being founde at scoole and lerning by the bequeste of\r\nthe sayde Master Carpenter\"--amounted to L19 12_s._ 8_d._, leaving a\r\nbalance to the City of L21 7_s._ 8_d._(1045) From so modest a beginning\r\narose the school which, situate on the Thames Embankment, now numbers over\r\n700 scholars.\r\n\r\n(M562)\r\n\r\nThere was a school attached to St. Paul's long before Colet's day, just as\r\nthere is one now, independent of the school of Colet's foundation, and\r\ndevoted mainly to the instruction of the Cathedral choristers. Soon after\r\nColet's appointment to the Deanery in 1505 he experienced no little\r\ndissatisfaction with the Cathedral School, where great laxity prevailed,\r\nmore especially in the religious education of the \"children of Paul's,\"\r\nand so, about the year 1509--the year of Henry's accession--having recently\r\ncome into a considerable estate by the death of his father, he set about\r\nacquiring a small property situate at the east end of St. Paul's Church\r\nfor the purpose of establishing another school which would better realise\r\nhis own ideal of what a school should be than the existing Cathedral\r\nSchool. Colet's School grew apace. In 1511 he was in negotiation with the\r\nCourt of Aldermen for the purchase \"of a certen grounde of the citie for\r\nan entre to be hadde into his new gramer scole.\"(1046) By January of the\r\nnext year (1512) he had succeeded in obtaining the assent both of the\r\nCourt of Aldermen and Common Council to the purchase by him of a \"certen\r\ngrounde in the Olde Chaunge for the inlargyng of his gramer scole in\r\nPowly's Churcheyerd\" for the sum of L30.(1047) The property was conveyed\r\nto him by deed, dated the 27th September, which deed was sealed with the\r\ncommon seal on the 7th October following.(1048) The question as to whom he\r\nshould entrust the management of his school caused Colet no little\r\nanxiety. He eventually decided to confide its revenues and management\r\nentirely to the Mercers' Company, and when asked the reason for his so\r\ndoing replied that \"though there was nothing certain in human affairs he\r\nyet found the least corruption in them.\"(1049)\r\n\r\nConsiderable rivalry existed among the various grammar schools of the\r\ncity, more especially between the boys of Colet's School and the boys of\r\nthe more ancient foundation of St. Antony, which, for a long time, had the\r\nreputation for turning out the best scholars. Public disputations were\r\nheld in the open air. The St. Paul's boys meeting St. Antony's boys would\r\nderisively call them St. Antony's pigs, that saint being generally\r\nrepresented with a pig following him, and challenge them to a disputation;\r\nthe latter would retaliate by styling their rivals \"pigeons of St.\r\nPaul's,\" from the bird which then, as now, frequented St. Paul's\r\nChurchyard. From questions of grammar, writes Stow,(1050) they usually\r\nfell to blows \"with their satchels full of books, many times in great\r\nheaps, that they troubled the streets and passengers.\" After the decay of\r\nSt. Antony's School the rivalry was taken up, but in a more friendly way,\r\nby the later foundation of the Merchant Taylors' School.\r\n\r\n(M563)\r\n\r\nBut the citizens of London did not limit their efforts in the cause of\r\neducation to their own city. Throughout the country there are to be found\r\ngrammar schools which owe their establishment to the liberal-mindedness\r\nand open-handed generosity of the city merchant.(1051) Their existence\r\nbears testimony to the kindly feeling which men who had grown rich in\r\nLondon still bore to the provincial town or village which gave them birth\r\nand which they had left in early life to seek their fortune in the great\r\nmetropolis.\r\n\r\nTo take but a few instances: Sir John Percival, a merchant-tailor, who in\r\n1487 filled the subordinate office of Lord Mayor's carver, performing his\r\nduties so well that the mayor, Sir Henry Colet, nominated him one of the\r\nsheriffs for the year ensuing by the time honoured custom of drinking to\r\nhim at a public dinner, founded a school at Macclesfield. Stephen Jenyns,\r\nanother merchant-tailor, did the same thing at Wolverhampton. Sir Thomas\r\nWhite, another member of the same company, founded two schools in the\r\nprovinces, one at Reading and another at Bristol, besides the College of\r\nSt. John at Oxford. Sir William Harper, yet another merchant-tailor,\r\nestablished a school at Bedford.\r\n\r\nThe Mercers' Company rivalled the Merchant-Taylors' in the number of\r\nschools established in the country through the liberality of its members.\r\nSir John Gresham founded one at Holt, in Norfolk; Sir Rowland Hill, an\r\nancestor of the originator of the Penny Postal scheme, another at Drayton,\r\nin Shropshire; whilst schools at Horsham, in Sussex, and West Lavington,\r\nin Wiltshire, were erected by two other mercers, Richard Collier and\r\nWilliam Dauntsey. There exist at the present day at least four schools\r\nwhich owe their foundation to wealthy members of the Grocers' Company, the\r\nwell known school at Oundle, co. Northampton, upon which the Company have\r\nexpended on capital account the sum of L35,000, having been founded by Sir\r\nWilliam Laxton; another at Sevenoaks, in Kent, by William Sevenoke, a\r\nnative of the place, who rose from very humble circumstances to the chief\r\nmagistracy of the city; another at Witney, in Oxfordshire, by Henry Box,\r\nand another at Colwall, co. Hereford, by Humphry Walwyn. Sir Andrew Judd,\r\na member of the Skinners' Company, established a school at Tonbridge,\r\nwhilst Sir Wolstan Dixie, another skinner, performed the same charitable\r\nact at Market Bosworth. Lastly, Sir George Monoux and Thomas Russell, both\r\nof them members of the Drapers' Company, founded schools at Walthamstow\r\nand at Barton-under-Needwood, co. Stafford, respectively.\r\n\r\n(M564)\r\n\r\nOn the Feast of St. Matthew (21 Sept.), 1515, a messenger arrived in the\r\ncity from Wolsey desiring the mayor and aldermen to attend that evening at\r\nSt. Paul's to return thanks to Almighty God for the queen, who was quick\r\nwith child. The summons was obeyed,(1052) and in the following February\r\n(1516) the Princess Mary was born.\r\n\r\n(M565)\r\n\r\nBy this time Wolsey had risen to be a great power in the State. In 1514 he\r\nhad been made Archbishop of York, and in the following year a cardinal.\r\nHis high position as a prince of the Church, as well as his authority with\r\nthe king, rendered it desirable for the citizens to keep well with him. On\r\nthe 6th March, 1516, it was resolved to send a deputation to the cardinal\r\nfor the purpose of securing his favour. No expense was to be spared in the\r\nmatter, and all costs and charges were to be paid by the Chamber.(1053) In\r\nthe following June the cardinal handed to the mayor a list of abuses in\r\nthe city which required reform. Sedition was rife there; the commons were\r\ndisobedient, the statute of apparel was ignored, vagabonds and masterless\r\nfolk resorted there and unlawful games were allowed in houses. The king's\r\ncouncil required an answer on these points within a few days, and an\r\nanswer was accordingly given, but the purport of it is not recorded,\r\nalthough it was read to the Court of Aldermen before being\r\ndespatched.(1054)\r\n\r\nIn November of the same year (1516) the City was in difficulties with the\r\nrecently erected Court of Star Chamber, and Wolsey, who practically kept\r\nthe whole business of government in his own hands, came to the City's\r\nassistance with advice. It appears that a subsidy was due on the 21st of\r\nthis month and the City had not paid its quota. The mayor and aldermen\r\nwere cited to appear before the cardinal and other lords of the council in\r\nthe Star Chamber at Westminster. Being asked if they had \"sworne for their\r\nassayng,\" to the king's subsidy, the Recorder answered on their behalf\r\nthat such procedure was contrary to Act of Parliament. The cardinal\r\nthereupon advised them to agree to give the king L2,000 in order to be\r\ndischarged of their oaths \"or ells every of theym to be sworn of and uppon\r\nthe true value of their substance within the sum of 100 marks.\" This took\r\nplace on Saturday, the 22nd, and the mayor and aldermen were to give an\r\nanswer to the Star Chamber by the following Wednesday. On Tuesday, the\r\n25th, the Court of Aldermen met to consider what was best to be done under\r\nthe circumstances. The decision they arrived at was that as the present\r\nassessment was less than the last, they would, in consideration of the\r\nking's letters, make up the sum then payable so that it should equal the\r\nlast assessment.(1055)\r\n\r\n(M566)\r\n\r\nThe seditious \"brutes\" or riots of which Wolsey had complained as daily\r\noccurring in the city were soon to assume a serious form. They were\r\noccasioned for the most part by the jealousy with which everybody who was\r\nnot a freeman of the city was looked upon by the free citizen. The influx\r\nof strangers and foreigners has been daily increasing, notwithstanding the\r\nlimitations and restrictions placed upon their residence and mode of\r\ntrading,(1056) whilst the tendency of freemen had been to leave the city\r\nfor the country.(1057)\r\n\r\nWhilst the civic authorities were doing all they could to prevent the\r\npossibility of a disturbance arising on the coming May-day(1058)--a day\r\nkept as a general holiday in the city--occasion was taken by a minister of\r\nthe church, whose duty it was to preach the usual Spital sermon on Easter\r\nTuesday (14 April), to incite the freemen to rise up against the foreigner\r\nand stranger.(1059) When the 1st May arrived all might have been well, had\r\nnot a city alderman allowed his zeal to outrun his discretion. It happened\r\nthat John Mundy,(1060) Alderman of Queenhithe Ward, came across some\r\nyoungsters playing \"at the bucklers\" at a time when by a recent order they\r\nshould have been within doors, and he commanded them to desist. This they\r\nshowed no disposition to do, and when force was threatened raised the cry\r\nfor 'prentices and clubs. A large crowd quickly assembled and the alderman\r\nhad to beat a hasty retreat. The mob, now thoroughly roused, proceeded to\r\nset free the prisoners in Newgate and the compters, and to attack the\r\nstrangers and foreigners quartered at Blanchappleton(1061) and elsewhere.\r\nRioting continued throughout the night, but early the following morning\r\nthey were met by a large force which the mayor in the meantime had\r\ncollected, and 300 of them were made prisoners, so that by the time that\r\nassistance arrived from the court quiet had been restored. A commission of\r\nOyer and Terminer was opened at the Guildhall to try the offenders. John\r\nLincoln, who had not so long ago been appointed surveyor of goods bought\r\nand sold by foreigners,(1062) was charged with being the instigator of the\r\nriot, and being found guilty was hanged in Cheapside, whilst twelve others\r\nwere hanged on gallows in different parts of the city. Others received the\r\nking's pardon with halters round their necks in token of the fate they\r\ndeserved.(1063)\r\n\r\n(M567)\r\n\r\nThe civic authorities were not unnaturally anxious to make their peace\r\nwith the king, and to disclaim any complicity in the late outbreak. The\r\nCourt of Aldermen met on the 11th May to consider how best to approach his\r\nmajesty on so delicate a subject. It was decided to send a deputation to\r\nthe lord cardinal to \"feel his mind\" as to the number of persons that\r\nshould appear before the king. The next day eight aldermen and the\r\nRecorder were nominated by the court \"to go the Kinges grace and to knowe\r\nhis plesure when the Mayr and Aldremen and diverse of the substancyall\r\ncommoners of this citie shall sue to beseche his grace to be good and\r\ngracious lord un to theym and to accept theym nowe beyng most sorrowful\r\nand hevye for thees late attemptates doon ayeynst their wylles.\"(1064)\r\n\r\n(M568) (M569) (M570)\r\n\r\nThe deputation forthwith proceeded, clothed in gowns of black, to\r\nGreenwich, whither the king had gone on the 11th May. The Recorder as\r\nusual acted as spokesman, and humbly prayed the royal forgiveness for the\r\nnegligence displayed by the mayor in not keeping the king's peace within\r\nthe city. The king in reply told them plainly his opinion that the civic\r\nauthorities had winked at the whole business, and referred them to\r\nCardinal Wolsey, his chancellor, who would declare to them his\r\npleasure.(1065) With this answer the deputation withdrew and reported what\r\nhad taken place to the mayor, who had wisely kept away. It was clear that\r\nabove all things the favour of the cardinal had to be obtained. For this\r\npurpose a committee was appointed, whose duty it was to \"devise what\r\nthinges of plesur shalbe geven to my lord Cardynall and to other of the\r\nlordes as they shall thynk convenient for their benevolences doon\r\nconcernyng this last Insurreccioun.\"(1066) By the 22nd May matters had\r\nevidently been accommodated. On that date the king sat at Westminster Hall\r\nin great state, surrounded by the lords of his council and attended by the\r\ncardinal. The mayor and aldermen and chief commoners of the city, chosen\r\nfrom the leading civic companies,(1067) had arrived by nine o'clock in the\r\nmorning clad in their best liveries, \"according as the cardinal had\r\ncommanded them.\"(1068) Wolsey knew the king's weakness for theatrical\r\ndisplay. At Henry's command all the prisoners were brought into his\r\npresence. They appeared, to the number of 400 men and eleven women, all\r\nwith ropes round their necks. After the cardinal had administered a rebuke\r\nto the civic authorities for their negligence, and had declared that the\r\nprisoners had deserved death, a formal pardon was proclaimed by the king,\r\nthe cardinal exhorting all present to loyalty and obedience. It was some\r\ntime before the effects of the late outbreak disappeared. Compensation for\r\nlosses had to be made;(1069) some were bound over to keep the peace;(1070)\r\nand counsel were employed to draw up a statement of the points of\r\ngrievance between the citizens and merchant strangers for submission to\r\nthe king.(1071) In September there were rumours of another outbreak, but\r\nthe civic authorities were better prepared than formerly, and effectually\r\nstopt any such attempt by putting suspected persons into prison.\r\n\r\nLest any unfavourable report should reach the cardinal, the Recorder and\r\nanother were ordered to ride in all haste to Sion, where Wolsey was\r\nthought to be, and if they failed to find him there, to follow him to\r\nWindsor and to report to him the active measures that had been taken to\r\nprevent any further insurrection in the city.(1072) \"Evil May-day\" was\r\nlong remembered by the citizens, who raised objection to Thomas Semer or\r\nSeymer, who had been sheriff at the time, being elected mayor ten years\r\nlater.(1073) In May, 1547, all householders were straitly charged not to\r\npermit their servants any more to go maying, but to keep them within\r\ndoors.(1074)\r\n\r\n(M571)\r\n\r\nWith gibbets all over the city, each bearing a ghastly freight, and the\r\nsummer approaching, it is scarcely surprising that the city should soon\r\nagain be visited with an epidemic. \"At the city gates,\" wrote an\r\neye-witness, \"one sees nothing but gibbets and the quarters of these\r\nwretches\"--the wretches who had been hanged for complicity in the late\r\ndisturbance--\"so that it is horrible to pass near them.\"(1075) The\r\n\"sweating sickness,\" which had again made its appearance in 1516, and had\r\nnever really quitted the city (except for a few weeks in winter), now\r\nraged more violently than ever, accompanied by measles and small-pox. The\r\nking ordered all inhabitants of infected houses to keep indoors and hang\r\nout wisps of straw, and when compelled to walk abroad to carry white\r\nrods.(1076) This order, however, was badly received in the city and gave\r\nrise to much murmuring and dissatisfaction.(1077) The civic authorities\r\ndid what they could to mitigate the evil by driving out beggars and\r\nvagabonds, and removing slaughter-houses outside the city walls,(1078) as\r\nwell as by administering relief to the poorer classes by the distribution\r\nof tokens or licences to solicit alms. These tokens consisted of round\r\n\"beedes\" of white tin, bearing the City's arms in the centre, to be worn\r\non the right shoulder.(1079) In the midst of so much real suffering, there\r\nwere not wanting those who took advantage of the charitable feeling which\r\nthe crisis called forth and were not ashamed to gain a livelihood by\r\nsimulating illness. Such a one was Miles Rose, who on the 11th March,\r\n1518, openly confessed before the Court of Aldermen that he had frequently\r\ndissembled the sickness of the \"fallyng evyle\" (or epilepsy) in divers\r\nparish churches in the city, on which occasions \"jemewes\" of silver,\r\ncalled cramp rings, would as often as not be placed on his fingers by\r\ncharitable passers-by, with which he would quickly make off, pocketing at\r\nthe same time many a twopence which had been bestowed upon him.(1080)\r\n\r\n(M572)\r\n\r\nThe city could scarcely have recovered its wonted appearance after the\r\nravages of the pestilence before its streets were enlivened with one of\r\nthose magnificent displays for which London became justly famous, the\r\noccasion being an embassy from the French king sent to negotiate a\r\nmarriage treaty between Henry's daughter Mary, a child but two years of\r\nage, and the still younger Dauphin of France. The City Records, strange to\r\nsay, appear to be altogether silent on this subject, and yet the embassy,\r\nfor magnificent display, was such as had never been seen within its walls\r\nbefore. We can understand that the embassy was not acceptable to the\r\nthrifty middle-class trading burgess, when we read that it was accompanied\r\nby a swarm of pedlars and petty hucksters who showed an unbecoming anxiety\r\nto do business in hats, caps and other merchandise, which under colour of\r\nthe embassy had been smuggled into the country duty free.(1081) The\r\nforeign retail trader was at the best of times an abomination to the free\r\nburgess, and this sharp practice on the part of the Frenchmen, coming so\r\nsoon after the recent outburst against strangers on Evil May-day, only\r\nserved to accentuate his animosity--\"At this dooing mannie an Englishman\r\ngrudged, but it availed not.\"(1082) The ambassadors were lodged at the\r\nMerchant Taylors' Hall, which, owing to the ill-timed action of the French\r\npedlars, had the look of a mart. On Sunday, the 3rd October, the king,\r\nwith a train of 1,000 mounted gentlemen richly dressed, attended by the\r\nlegates and foreign ambassadors, went in procession to St. Paul's to hear\r\nmass; after which the king took his oath--a ceremonial which the French\r\nadmiral declared to be \"too magnificent for description.\" On the following\r\nTuesday (5 Oct.) the marriage ceremony--so far as it could be carried out\r\nbetween such infants--was celebrated at Greenwich, and a tiny gold ring, in\r\nwhich was a valuable diamond, placed upon Mary's finger.(1083)\r\n\r\n(M573)\r\n\r\nIn the following year (July, 1519) the streets witnessed another scene of\r\ngaiety. This time it was a visit of the legate, Cardinal Campeggio, for\r\nwhich the civic authorities made great preparations.(1084) In the first\r\nplace the mayor and aldermen, in their gowns and cloaks of scarlet, were\r\nordered to take up their position at 9 o'clock on the morning of Relic\r\nSunday (_i.e._, the third Sunday after Midsummer Day) at St. Paul's stairs\r\n(_the stayers w__t__in poulys_). Next to them were to stand the Skinners,\r\nthen the Mercers and other worshipful crafts in their order, clothed in\r\ntheir last and best livery. In this manner the street was to be lined on\r\neither side from the west door of St. Paul's down to Baynard's Castle.\r\nUpon the arrival of the lord cardinal and other lords at the Cathedral the\r\nmayor and aldermen were to head the procession and seat themselves in the\r\nchoir to hear _Te Deum_ sung. Bonfires or \"pryncypall fyres\" were to be\r\nlighted at St. Magnus corner, Gracechurch, Leadenhall, the conduit on\r\nCornhill, St. Thomas \"of Acres,\" the Standard and little conduit in Cheap,\r\nthe Standard in Fleet Street, and in Bishopsgate Street; whilst cresset\r\nlights and small fires \"made after the manner of Midsummer-night\" were to\r\nadd to the gaiety of the scene. Men-at-arms, well harnessed and\r\napparelled, were to keep certain streets, whilst the aldermen and their\r\nconstables were to keep watch and ward in their best array of harness. The\r\nambassadors, who were to be lodged in Cornhill, were to be escorted home\r\nat night by the aldermen with torches, and to await their commands. There\r\nwas one other, perhaps not unnecessary, direction to be followed, which\r\nwas to the effect that if by any chance the strangers should be overcome\r\nby the hospitality of the city, or, in the words of the record--\"yf eny\r\noversyght be wt moche drynke of the strangers\"--the citizens were to \"lett\r\ntheym alone and no Englishemen to medyle wt theym.\"\r\n\r\n(M574) (M575)\r\n\r\nThe legate landed at Deal on the 23rd July, and by slow stages was\r\nconducted with every mark of respect to London. His passage through the\r\ncity was associated with an episode of a decidedly comic character if we\r\nare to believe the chronicler. A story is told(1085) that the night before\r\nCampeggio entered London, Wolsey sent him twelve mules with (empty)\r\ncoffers, in order to give a semblance of wealth to the legate and his\r\nretinue. In Cheapside one of the mules turned restive and upset the\r\nchests, out of which tumbled old hose, shoes, bread, meat, and eggs, with\r\n\"muche vile baggage,\" at which the street boys cried \"See, see my lord\r\nlegate's treasure!\" The story, however, is on good authority deemed more\r\nmalicious than probable.\r\n\r\n(M576)\r\n\r\nIn January, 1519, the Emperor Maximilian died and left the imperial crown\r\nto be contested for by the kings of France and Spain. It eventually fell\r\nto the latter, and Charles V of Spain was elected Emperor Charles I, the\r\nevent being celebrated by a solemn mass and _Te Deum_ at St. Paul's,\r\nfollowed by a banquet at Castle Baynard.(1086)\r\n\r\n(M577)\r\n\r\nBoth France and Germany were eager to secure the co-operation of Henry.\r\nCharles anticipated the meeting which was to take place between Henry and\r\nFrancis on the famous Field of the Cloth of Gold by coming over in person\r\nto England (May, 1519) and having a private conference with his uncle. The\r\nyoung emperor did not visit the city on this occasion; but in 1522, when\r\nwar had broken out between him and Francis and he was again in England, he\r\nwas escorted to the city with great honour and handsomely lodged in the\r\npalace of Bridewell. Nearly L1,000 was raised to meet the expenses of his\r\nreception and of furnishing a body of 100 bowmen for the king's\r\nservice.(1087)\r\n\r\nThe king and his guest and ally were met at St. George's Bar in Southwark\r\nby John Melborne,(1088) the mayor, accompanied by the high officers of the\r\ncity, clothed in gowns of \"pewke,\" each with a chain of gold about his\r\nneck.(1089) A \"proposicioun\" or address was made by Sir Thomas More, now\r\nunder-treasurer of England, who was afterwards presented by the City with\r\nthe sum of L10 towards a velvet gown,(1090) whilst other speeches made in\r\nthe course of the procession were composed by Master Lilly,(1091) of\r\nEuphues fame, the first high master of Colet's School.\r\n\r\n(M578)\r\n\r\nBetween the first and second visits of the emperor the citizens had\r\nwitnessed some strange sights and had gone through much suffering and\r\nprivation. The city had scarcely ever been free from sickness, and famine\r\nand pestilence had followed one another in quick succession. In September,\r\n1520, the fellowships or civic companies subscribed over L1,000 for the\r\npurchase of wheat(1092) to be stored at the Bridgehouse, where ovens were\r\nfitted up.(1093) Mills for grinding corn already existed in the Thames\r\nhard by.(1094) The following year the plague raged to such an extent that\r\nevery house attacked was ordered to be marked with St. Antony's cross,\r\n\"otherwise called the syne of Tav,\"(1095) and citizens were forbidden to\r\nattend the fair at Windsor for fear of carrying infection to the\r\ncourt.(1096)\r\n\r\nAgain a scarcity of corn was feared, and the Bridge-masters were\r\nauthorised by the Court of Common Council to purchase provisions, the\r\ncorporation undertaking to give security for the repayment of all monies\r\nadvanced by the charitably disposed for the purpose of staving off\r\nfamine.(1097) Early in 1522 (15 Jan.) died Fitz-James, Bishop of London,\r\ncarried off with many others by \"a great death in London and other places\r\nof the realm.\"(1098)\r\n\r\n(M579)\r\n\r\nThe citizens had also in the meanwhile witnessed the arrest and execution\r\nof the Duke of Buckingham, son of the duke who figured so prominently\r\nbefore the citizens when the crown was offered to Richard III at Baynard\r\nCastle. He was seized one day whilst landing from his barge at the Hay\r\nWharf, on a number of charges all more or less frivolous. His attendants\r\nwere dismissed to the duke's \"Manor of the Rose,\" in the parish of St.\r\nLaurence Pountney(1099)--on the site of which recently stood Merchant\r\nTaylors' School--whilst he himself was conducted to the Tower (16 April,\r\n1521).  An indictment was laid against him at the Guildhall before Sir\r\nJohn Brugge, lord mayor, and others (8 May). After a trial at Westminster\r\nwhich lasted some days, he was found guilty of high treason, and condemned\r\nto be hanged, drawn and quartered, and to suffer such other atrocities as\r\nusually accompanied the death of a traitor in those days. The king,\r\nhowever, satisfied with his condemnation, spared him these indignities,\r\nand the duke was allowed to meet his death at the block. His corpse was\r\nreverently carried from the Tower to the Church of the Austin Friars by\r\nsix poor members of that Order.(1100)\r\n\r\nThe duke had other friends in the city besides these poor religious men,\r\nwho thus requited in the only way they could many acts of kindness done to\r\ntheir Order by Buckingham in his life time, and his death gave rise to\r\nmuch disaffection and seditious language for some time afterwards.(1101)\r\n\r\n(M580)\r\n\r\nBefore the emperor left England he succeeded in committing Henry to an\r\ninvasion of France. In order to carry out his object the king needed\r\nmoney, and the City was asked to furnish him with the sum of\r\nL100,000.(1102) Ten days later (26 May) the City agreed to advance\r\nL20,000. The livery companies were to be called upon to surrender their\r\nplate, and foreigners as well as citizens were to be made to\r\ncontribute.(1103)\r\n\r\n(M581)\r\n\r\nThe question arose whether the aldermen should be jointly assessed with\r\nthe commoners or by themselves. The mayor and aldermen were willing to\r\ncontribute the sum of L3,000,(1104) but this offer the Common Council\r\n\"nothyng regarded,\" but sent the common sergeant to talk the matter over\r\nwith them. After long consultation the mayor and aldermen sent back word\r\nthat it was more \"convenient\" that they should be assessed with the\r\ncommoners and not to be severed.(1105)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime a hasty valuation had been made by the command of Wolsey\r\nof the plate of the livery companies, and of the ready money lying in\r\ntheir halls, the whole value of which was estimated to be L4,000. This,\r\ntogether with the sum of L10,000 which the Court of Aldermen purposed\r\nraising among the wealthier class of citizens, was all that the cardinal\r\nwas given to expect from the City.(1106) On the 24th May the deputation,\r\nwhich had ridden with all speed after the cardinal in order to make this\r\nreport, returned to the city and reported to the Court of Aldermen that\r\nhis grace was in no wise satisfied with the City's offer, and that he\r\nexpected the City to furnish the king with at least L30,000, of which\r\nL10,000 was to be ready within three days.(1107) The matter was\r\ncompromised by the City consenting to advance L20,000.\r\n\r\nIn June the Recorder had an interview with Wolsey respecting the security\r\nto be given for repayment of the loan. The cardinal refused to allow that\r\ncertain abbots, abbesses and priors, who had been named, should enter into\r\nbond, and the citizens were obliged to be content with the personal\r\nsecurities of the king and Wolsey himself. Touching the plate of the\r\nhalls, the cardinal wished only to take it in case of absolute necessity,\r\nand then only at a fair price. He desired the owners to bring it to the\r\nTower, \"there to be coyned and they [_i.e._, the government] to pay the\r\nseyd money that so shalbe coyned.\" The result of the Recorder's interview\r\nwas reported to the Court of Aldermen the 17th June.(1108) A committee had\r\nalready (2 June) to take an account of the plate brought in and to enter\r\nits true weight in a book.(1109)\r\n\r\n(M582) (M583)\r\n\r\nThe recent loan of L20,000 had scarcely been raised(1110) before the\r\ncitizens found it necessary to make a further advance of 4,000 marks.\r\nTheir liberality was repaid by a gracious letter from Wolsey himself, in\r\nwhich he promised to see the money repaid in a fortnight,(1111) and to\r\nextend to them his favour. What vexed the citizens more than anything was\r\nbeing compelled to make oath before the cardinal's deputy sitting in the\r\nChapter House of St. Paul's as to the amount each was worth in money,\r\nplate, jewels, household goods and merchandise,--a system of inquisition\r\nrecently introduced.(1112)\r\n\r\n(M584) (M585)\r\n\r\nAs if all this were not enough Wolsey demanded another loan before the end\r\nof the year. This was too much even for the patient and open-handed London\r\nburgess. The Common Council determined (4 Nov.) to put a stop to these\r\nextortionate demands, and resolved that, \"As touchyng the Requeste made by\r\nmy lorde cardynalles grace for appreste or aloone of more money to the\r\nkynges grace, they can in no wise agre thereto, but they ar and wilbe well\r\ncontendid to be examyned uppon their othes yf it shall please his grace so\r\nto do.\"(1113) The stand thus made by the citizens against illegal\r\nexactions gave courage to others. The king's commissioners were forcibly\r\ndriven out of Kent, and open rebellion was threatened in other\r\ncounties.(1114)\r\n\r\n(M586)\r\n\r\nThere was only one course left open to Henry, and that was to summon a\r\nparliament. For nearly eight years no parliament had sat. It was now\r\nsummoned to meet on the 15th April, 1523, not at Westminster, but at the\r\nhouse of the Blackfriars.(1115) The names of the city's representatives\r\nare on record. The aldermen elected one of their body, George Monoux, and\r\nwith him was associated \"according to ancient customs,\" the city's\r\nRecorder, William Shelley; whilst the commons elected John Hewster, a\r\nmercer, and William Roche, a draper(1116)\r\n\r\nA few days after the election a committee of fourteen members was\r\nnominated to consider what matters should be laid before parliament as\r\nbeing for the welfare of the city.(1117) Sir Thomas More was chosen\r\nSpeaker. The enormous sum of L800,000 was demanded. Expecting some\r\nhesitation on the part of the Commons, Wolsey himself determined to argue\r\nwith them, and suddenly made his appearance in state. Finding that his\r\nspeech was received in grim silence, he turned to More for a reply. The\r\nSpeaker, falling on his knees, declared his inability to make any answer\r\nuntil he had received the instructions of the House, and intimated that\r\nperhaps the silence of the Commons was due to the cardinal's presence.\r\nWolsey accordingly departed discomforted.(1118) His attempt to overawe\r\nparliament marks the beginning of his downfall. He still kept well with\r\nthe city, however, and rendered it several small services.\r\n\r\n(M587)\r\n\r\nEmboldened by their recent success the citizens determined to make a stand\r\nagainst other exactions, and when in May, 1523, another demand was made\r\nfor one hundred bowmen, as in the previous year, they sent their charter\r\nto the cardinal and begged that the article touching citizens not being\r\nliable to foreign service might remain in force. A similar demand was made\r\nin the following November, and again the assistance of Wolsey was called\r\nin.(1119) The City on the other hand had recently conferred a favour on\r\nthe cardinal by discharging Robert Amadas, his own goldsmith, from serving\r\nas alderman when elected in March of this year.(1120)\r\n\r\n(M588)\r\n\r\nIn June the king and queen of Denmark paid a visit to the city and\r\nattended mass at St. Paul's,(1121) when the Court of Aldermen made them a\r\npresent of two hogsheads of wine, one of white and another of claret, and\r\ntwo \"awmes\" of Rhenish wine, two fresh salmon, a dozen great pike, four\r\ndozen of \"torchettes,\" and eight dozen of \"syses.\"(1122)\r\n\r\n(M589)\r\n\r\nThe joint attack of Henry and the emperor against France in 1523 proved as\r\ngreat a failure as that of 1522. In the midst of the campaign Henry was\r\nthreatened with danger nearer home. The Scots marched southward, and\r\ncreated such a panic in the city that a solemn procession, in which\r\nfigured Cuthbert Tunstal, Bishop of London (successor to the unfortunate\r\nFitz-James), the mayor and aldermen, all the king's justices, and all the\r\nsergeants-at-law, took place every day for a week.(1123) After a futile\r\nattack upon Wark Castle the invaders withdrew and all danger was\r\nover.(1124)\r\n\r\n(M590)\r\n\r\nWhen the Feast of St. Edward (13 Oct.) came round, George Monoux, alderman\r\nand draper, who had already (1514-15) once filled the office of mayor of\r\nthe city, was re-elected; but refusing to accept the call of his\r\nfellow-citizens he was fined L1,000. It was thereupon declared by the\r\nCourt of Aldermen that anyone who in future should be elected mayor, and\r\nrefused to take up office, should be mulcted in a like sum.(1125) Monoux's\r\nfine was remitted the following year, and he was discharged from\r\nattendance, although keeping his aldermanry, on account of ill health. In\r\nreturn for this favour he made over to the Corporation his brewhouse\r\nsituate near the Bridgehouse in Southwark.(1126)\r\n\r\n(M591)\r\n\r\nBefore the close of the year (3 Dec., 1523) the king pledged himself by\r\nletters patent to repay the loan of L20,000 which the City had advanced\r\nfor his defence of the realm and maintenance of the wars against France\r\nand Scotland.(1127)\r\n\r\n(M592)\r\n\r\nThe disappointment experienced by Wolsey in not being selected to fill the\r\nPapal chair on the death of Adrian VI induced him to take measures for\r\ntransferring his master's power from the imperial court to the court of\r\nFrance. In the meantime a league was formed between Henry, the emperor,\r\nand Charles, Duke of Bourbon, for the conquest and partition of France.\r\nDuring the formation of this league some correspondence between England\r\nand the Continent appears to have been lost in a remarkable manner, to\r\njudge from the following proclamation,(1128) made the 10th July, 1524:--\r\n\r\n(M593)\r\n\r\n\r\n    _\"My lorde the maire streitly chargith and commaundith on the king\r\n    or soveraigne lordis behalf that if any maner of person or persons\r\n    that have founde a hat with certeyn lettres and other billes and\r\n    writinges therin enclosed which lettres been directed to o__r__\r\n    said soveraigne lorde from the parties of beyond the see let hym\r\n    or theym bryng the said hat lettres and writinges unto my said\r\n    lorde the maire in all the hast possible and they shalbe well\r\n    rewarded for their labour and that no maner of person kepe the\r\n    said hat lettres and writinges nor noon of them after this\r\n    proclamacioun made uppon payn of deth and God save the king.\"_\r\n\r\n\r\n(M594) (M595)\r\n\r\nThe news of the defeat and capture of the French king at Pavia (24 Feb.,\r\n1525) was hailed by Henry with great delight. The crown of France was now,\r\nhe thought, within his grasp. On Saturday, the 11th March, a triumph was\r\nmade in the city to celebrate \"the takynge of the Frenche kyng in Bataill\r\nby Themporer and his alies.\"(1129) Bonfires were lighted at different\r\nplaces, one being in Saint Paul's Churchyard near the house where lay the\r\nforeign ambassadors. The Chamberlain was ordered to provide a hogshead of\r\nwine at every fire. The city minstrels filled the air with music, and the\r\nparish clerks attended with their singing children, who sat about the\r\nbonfires and sang ballads and \"other delectable and joyfull songs.\" On the\r\nSunday following the king and queen and officers of state attended a _Te\r\nDeum_ at St. Paul's, the legate himself pronouncing the benediction.(1130)\r\n\r\n(M596)\r\n\r\nHenry's first impulse was to take advantage of the French king's\r\nmisfortune; the cardinal, on the other hand, saw danger in the\r\npredominating influence of Charles in Europe, and would gladly have seen\r\nhis master join hands with Francis against the emperor. He was\r\nnevertheless bound to carry out the king's wishes as if they were his own,\r\nand money was necessary for the purpose. Instead of resorting to a\r\nbenevolence--a mode of raising money already declared by parliament to be\r\nillegal--he suggested that the people should be asked for what was called\r\nan Amicable Loan, on the old feudal ground that the king was about to lead\r\nan expedition in person. The citizens were among the first to whom Wolsey\r\nmade application. Were they of opinion, he asked, that the king should\r\nundertake the expedition to France in person? If so, he could not go\r\notherwise than beseemed a prince, and this he could not do without the\r\ncity's aid. The sum they were asked to subscribe did not, he said, amount\r\nto half their substance, which the king might very well have demanded.\r\nWhen it was objected that trade had been bad, Wolsey lost his temper and\r\ndeclared that it was better that some citizens should suffer rather than\r\nthat the king should be in want, and that if they refused to pay it might\r\n\"fortune to cost some their heddes.\"(1131) At length the citizens agreed\r\nto grant the king a sixth part of their substance, which Henry graciously\r\nacknowledged by letter (25 April),(1132) saying that it was not his wish\r\nto overburden them, for he valued their prosperity more than ten such\r\nrealms as France. The letter was read, by Wolsey's express wish, to the\r\nCommon Council on the 28th, when it was agreed to ask for a fortnight's\r\ngrace before sending an answer to so important a missive.(1133) A\r\ndeputation was forthwith despatched to Hampton Court to solicit the\r\ncardinal's mediation, but not being able to obtain an interview they\r\nreturned, and steps were taken to raise the money required.\r\n\r\nWhen the cardinal was informed later on that the alderman of each ward was\r\nholding an enquiry as to the means of the inhabitants he affected to be\r\nvery angry. \"They had no right to examine anyone,\" he said; \"I am your\r\ncommissioner, I will examine you one by one myself.\" The mayor (Sir\r\nWilliam Bailey) thereupon threw himself at the cardinal's feet beseeching\r\nhim that since it was by Act of Common Council that the aldermen had sat\r\nin their respective wards for the purpose of taking the benevolence--a\r\nprocedure which he now perceived to be against the law--the Act should by\r\nthe Common Council be revoked. \"Well,\" said Wolsey \"I am content,\" and he\r\nthen proceeded to ask how much the mayor and aldermen then present were\r\nprepared to give. When the mayor incautiously remarked that if he made any\r\npromise there and then it might perhaps cost him his life, Wolsey again\r\nbecame furious. What! the mayor's life threatened for obeying the king's\r\norders! He would see to that.\r\n\r\nIn the country the loan met with so much opposition that a rebellion was\r\nfeared. At length, finding it was impossible to collect the money, Wolsey\r\nsent (19 May) for the mayor and aldermen and informed them that the king\r\nhad given up all thoughts of his expedition to France, and that they were\r\npardoned of all that had been demanded of them.(1134)\r\n\r\n(M597) (M598)\r\n\r\nBefore many weeks elapsed Wolsey saw with satisfaction a truce made\r\nbetween Henry and the queen regent of France.(1135) Early in 1526 the\r\nFrench king regained his liberty by virtue of a treaty which he at once\r\nrepudiated, and war between him and the emperor was renewed, but England\r\nremained virtually at peace. In the following year (1527) the cardinal\r\nhimself paid a visit to the French king and superintended the drawing up\r\nof articles for a permanent peace. By September all was settled, and\r\nWolsey returned to England. Ambassadors from France shortly afterwards\r\narrived, and were lodged in the Bishop of London's palace in St. Paul's\r\nChurchyard. The City made them valuable presents at the instance of the\r\nlord cardinal.(1136)\r\n\r\n(M599) (M600) (M601) (M602)\r\n\r\nThe election of Paul Wythypol,(1137) a merchant-tailor, as alderman of the\r\nWard of Farringdon Within, in 1527, again brought Henry and the citizens\r\ninto variance. The king desired Wythypol's discharge, at least for a time.\r\nThe Court of Aldermen hesitated to accede to the request and consulted\r\nWolsey.(1138) He recommended them an interview with the king at Greenwich.\r\nTo Greenwich they accordingly went (24 Feb.) by water, where they arrived\r\nin time to give a formal reception to the cardinal, who landed soon\r\nafterwards from his barge. After a few words had passed between the\r\ncardinal and the municipal officers, the former entered the palace, whilst\r\nthe latter waited in the king's great chamber till dinner time. When that\r\nhour arrived they were bidden to go down to the hall, where the mayor was\r\nentertained at the lord steward's mess, and the aldermen received like\r\nattention from the comptroller and other officers of state. The city's\r\nCounsel who had accompanied the mayor and aldermen were entertained at the\r\ntable of \"master coferer.\" Dinner over, the company returned to the great\r\nchamber, where they were kept waiting till the evening. At length the\r\nmayor and aldermen were bidden to the king's presence in his secret\r\nchamber. What took place there the writer of the record declares himself\r\nunable to say,(1139) and, although the mayor afterwards made a report of\r\nthe matter to the court, no particulars are recorded in the City's\r\narchives. The practical outcome of the interview appears to have been that\r\nWythypol was left unmolested for a whole twelve-month. When that time had\r\nelapsed he was again summoned before the Court of Aldermen either to\r\naccept office or take the oath prescribed.(1140) Refusing both these\r\npropositions he was committed to Newgate.(1141) This took place on the 6th\r\nFebruary, 1528. On the 3rd March he appeared in person before the Court of\r\nAldermen and desired a respite from office, or to be allowed to pay a\r\nfine. Being asked the amount of fine he was prepared to pay, he offered\r\nL40, and at the same time asked to be discharged from office for a period\r\nof three years. This offer was declined, and Wythypol was again ordered to\r\ntake the oath prescribed for his discharge.(1142) Nearly three months were\r\nallowed to elapse before any further steps were taken, when, on the 22nd\r\nMay, the court again ordered Wythypol to appear at its next meeting, and\r\nto take up office, or else take the oath, or pay such fine as should be\r\nassessed by the mayor, aldermen and common council.(1143) It is certain\r\nthat he did not take office, so the conclusion must be that he availed\r\nhimself of one or other of the alternatives open to him. John Brown was\r\nelected alderman of Farringdon Within shortly afterwards, but he was\r\ndischarged by the Common Council, and the aldermanry was subsequently\r\nfilled by John Hardy being translated to it from Aldersgate Ward.(1144)\r\n\r\n(M603)\r\n\r\nIn addition to an epidemic of sickness,(1145) the city was threatened the\r\nfollowing year with a famine, notwithstanding the fact that large\r\nquantities of grain had been stored up in various parts of the city by\r\norder of the municipal authorities. The country had suffered recently by\r\nheavy rains, and large tracts of land had been inundated. In anticipation\r\nof trouble, a large stock of wheat had been laid in, but when it came to\r\nthe point of disposing of it, the bakers of the city and the bakers of\r\nStratford-at-Bow declined to take it except at their own price, until\r\ncompelled by threats and, in some cases, imprisonment.(1146)\r\n\r\n(M604)\r\n\r\nFor some years past Henry had been meditating a divorce from Catherine of\r\nAragon, his brother's widow, but it was not until 1529 that the assent of\r\nthe Pope was at last obtained to try the validity of the marriage. The\r\nlegatine court sat in the city at the house of the Blackfriars, where\r\nevery arrangement was made to add dignity to the proceedings. At its head\r\nsat the two cardinals, Campeggio and Wolsey, on chairs covered with cloth\r\nof gold, and on their right sat Henry himself.(1147) The sudden suspension\r\nof all proceedings after the court had sat for some weeks, and the\r\nrevocation of the cause to the Court of Rome, led to Wolsey's downfall. In\r\nOctober the seals were taken from him and given to Sir Thomas More, his\r\nfurniture and plate were seized, and he himself ordered to remove from\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n(M605)\r\n\r\nA few days after Wolsey's disgrace a banquet was held at the Guildhall on\r\nthe occasion of the swearing in of Ralph Dodmer, the newly-elected mayor.\r\nIt is the first lord mayor's banquet of which any particulars have come\r\ndown to us, and they are interesting as recording the names of the chief\r\nguests. The mayor's court, the scene of the feast, was boarded and hung\r\nwith cloth of Arras for the occasion. One table was set apart for peers of\r\nthe realm, at the head of which sat the new lord chancellor and at the\r\nbottom the lords Berkeley and Powis. At either side of the table sat nine\r\npeers, among whom were the dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, the one being the\r\ntreasurer and the other the marshal of England, Sir Thomas Grey, Marquis\r\nof Dorset, the Earl of Oxford, high chamberlain, and the Earl of\r\nShrewsbury, lord steward of England, Tunstal, Bishop of London, Sir Thomas\r\nBoleyn, Lord Rochford, whose daughter Anne was shortly to experience the\r\nperil of sharing Henry's throne, Lord Audley, and others.  At two other\r\ntables, placed between the court of orphans and the mayor's court, were\r\nentertained a number of knights and other gentlemen, whose names are not\r\nrecorded.(1148)\r\n\r\n(M606)\r\n\r\nIt was not long before further proceedings were taken against the king's\r\nlate minister. On the 3rd November (1529), after the lapse of six years,\r\nparliament met in the city at the palace of Bridewell. The City was\r\nrepresented by Thomas Seymer, an alderman and ex-mayor, John Baker, the\r\nCity's Recorder, John Petyte, grocer, and Paul Wythypol,(1149) the\r\nmerchant-tailor whose election as alderman had recently created no little\r\ntrouble. Among other members was Thomas Cromwell,(1150) a friend of\r\nWolsey, and destined soon to take his place as the king's chief adviser. A\r\nbill for disabling the cardinal from being restored to his former\r\ndignities was carried by the Lords and sent down to the Commons (1 Dec.).\r\nThere it is said to have met with the strenuous opposition of Cromwell. Of\r\nthis, however, there is some doubt, as it is uncertain whether the bill\r\nprovoked any discussion, parliament being shortly afterward prorogued (17\r\nDec.) and the unhappy cardinal left in suspense as to what fate was in\r\nstore for him.(1151) At Christmas he fell ill, and the king's heart became\r\nso far softened towards his old favourite that early in the following year\r\n(Feb., 1530) he was restored to the archbishopric of York with all its\r\npossessions except York-place (Whitehall) in Westminster, which Henry\r\ncould not bring himself to surrender. His colleges were seized; the\r\ncollege he had founded at Ipswich was sold; but his college at Oxford,\r\nknown as Cardinal College, was afterwards re-established under the name of\r\nChrist Church. He himself was not allowed to rest long in peace. He was\r\nsummoned to London on a charge of treason, for which there was little or\r\nno foundation, but the troubles of the last two years had rendered him so\r\ninfirm that he died on the way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(M607)\r\n\r\nAlthough Wolsey was no more, his works followed him. He it was, and not\r\nHenry, who first conceived the idea of church reform, towards which some\r\nsteps had been taken in Wolsey's lifetime. It was left for Henry to carry\r\nout the design of his great minister. When the king laid his hand on the\r\nmonasteries, he only followed the example set by the cardinal in 1525,\r\nwhen some of the smaller religious houses in Kent, Sussex and Essex were\r\nsuppressed for his great foundation of Oxford. To assist him in carrying\r\nout his design he turned to parliament. Relieved as they now were of the\r\noppression of the great nobles, the Commons were ready to use their\r\nnewly-acquired independence against the clergy, who exacted extravagant\r\nfees and misused the powers of the ecclesiastical courts. Acts were passed\r\nregulating the payment of mortuary fees and the fees for probate, whilst\r\nanother Act restricted the holding of pluralities and the taking of ferms\r\nby church-men.(1152) The clergy threatened to appeal to Rome, but were\r\nwarned that such action would be met with pains and penalties as opposed\r\nto the royal prerogative.(1153)\r\n\r\n(M608)\r\n\r\nIn the city the question of tithes payable to the clergy had been always\r\nmore or less a vexed question. Before the commencement of the thirteenth\r\ncentury the city clergy had been supported by casual dues in addition to\r\ntheir glebe land. These casual payments were originally personal, but\r\nsubsequently became regulated by the amount of rent paid by parishioners\r\nfor their houses. A question arose as to whether the citizens were also\r\nliable to pay personal tithes on their gains, and it was eventually\r\ndecided that they were so liable.(1154)\r\n\r\nOn the 31st August, 1527, a committee, which had been specially appointed\r\nto enquire into matters concerning the city's welfare, reported, among\r\nother things, upon the tithe question as it then stood in the city.(1155)\r\nThe \"curates,\" they said, had purchased a Bull of Pope Nicholas, on the\r\n6th August, 1453, and this Bull had been confirmed by Act of Common\r\nCouncil on the 3rd March, 1475. Not only was the amount of the tithe\r\npayable fixed by the Bull, but the Bull itself was to be publicly read by\r\nthe curates four times a year, so that no doubt should exist in the minds\r\nof the parishioners. This the curates had failed to do, and had caused\r\ntheir parishioners heavy legal expenses in disputing demands for tithes.\r\nOne man was known to have spent as much as L100 in his own defence. The\r\ncommittee suggested that the whole question should be referred to the\r\nBishop of London, and that a translation of the Bull should be exhibited\r\nin every church. The citizens were the more aggrieved because many\r\nparsonages and vicarages were let to ferm.(1156)\r\n\r\n(M609)\r\n\r\nThe curates made their defence in a book of eighteen articles touching\r\ntithes and other oblations, the chief point being that every householder,\r\ntime out of mind, had been bound to pay to God and the Church one farthing\r\nout of every 10_s._ of rent, a half-penny out of 20_s._ and so forth, on\r\n100 days of the year; amounting in all to 2_s._ 1_d._ for every 10_s._\r\nrent _per annum_. This manner of payment proving tedious, the curates and\r\ntheir parishioners came to an agreement that 1_s._ 2_d._ should be paid on\r\nevery 6_s._ 8_d._ or noble, and this sum the curates had been receiving\r\ntime out of mind, none reclaiming or denying. But, inasmuch as this\r\npayment by occupiers of houses was only ordained for a \"dowry\" to the\r\nparish churches of London which had no glebe lands, the curates demanded\r\nthat all merchants and artificers, with other occupiers of the city,\r\nshould pay personal tithes of their \"lucre or encrece\" according to the\r\ncommon law, and as \"well conscyoned\" men had been in the habit of paying\r\nin times past.(1157) The book of articles was laid before the Court of\r\nCommon Council on the 16th February, 1528, by Robert Carter and six other\r\npriests, on behalf of their entire body. On the following 16th March the\r\nCourt of Aldermen for themselves agreed to pay tithe at the forthcoming\r\nEaster according to the Bull of Pope Nicholas, and not after the rate of\r\n1_s._ 2_d._ on the noble,(1158) whilst four days later the Common Council\r\ndecided that, for the sake of convenience, bills should be posted in every\r\nparish church within the city showing the number of offering days (viz.,\r\neighty-two) and the amount to be offered by inhabitants of the city.(1159)\r\n\r\nSo matters continued until, early in 1534, it was agreed to submit the\r\nwhole question to the lord chancellor and other members of the council,\r\nwho made their award a few days before Easter.(1160) It decreed that at\r\nthe forthcoming festival every subject should pay to the parson or curate\r\nof his parish after the rate of 2_s._ 9_d._ in the pound, and 16 pence\r\nhalf-penny in the half-pound, and that every man's wife, servant, child\r\nand apprentice receiving the Holy Sacrament should pay two pence. These\r\npayments were to continue to be paid \"without grudge or murmur\" until such\r\ntime as the council should arrive at a final settlement.(1161)\r\n\r\n(M610)\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the city had been made to feel the heavy hand of the king\r\nand of his new minister, Thomas Cromwell. In May, 1530, Elsing Spital, a\r\nhouse established by William Elsing, a charitable mercer, for the relief\r\nof the blind, but which had subsequently grown into a priory of\r\nAugustinian canons of wealth and position, was confiscated by the Crown.\r\nWhat became of the blind inmates is not known. In the following year\r\n(1531) the Priory of Holy Trinity, Aldgate, shared the same fate. The\r\npriory had existed since the time of Henry I and the \"good queen\"\r\nMatilda,(1162) and its prior enjoyed the singular distinction of being\r\n_ex__ officio_ an alderman of the city. The canons were now removed to\r\nanother place and the building and site bestowed by Henry upon his\r\nchancellor, Sir Thomas Audley.(1163)\r\n\r\n(M611)\r\n\r\nBetween 1531 and 1534 the City enjoyed some respite from attack. It even\r\nrecovered some of its lost privileges. In 1521 Henry had deprived the City\r\nof its right to the Great Beam, and of the issues and profits derived from\r\nit, and had caused a conveyance of it to be made to Sir William Sidney. In\r\n1531 the beam was re-conveyed to the City.(1164) The Grocers' Company were\r\nscarcely less interested in the beam than the City, for to them was\r\ndeputed the choice of weighers, who were afterwards admitted and sworn\r\nbefore the Court of Aldermen. Both the City and the company used their\r\nbest endeavours to recover their lost rights, the former going so far as\r\nto sanction the distribution of the sum of L23 6_s._ 8_d._ between the\r\nking's sergeant, the king's attorney, and one \"Lumnore,\"(1165) a servant\r\nof \"my lady Anne,\"(1166) with the view of gaining their object the\r\neasier.(1167) A compromise was subsequently effected by which Sir William\r\nSidney continued to hold the beam at an annual rent payable to the\r\nCity,(1168) until, in 1531, he consented to a surrender, and it became\r\nagain vested in the Corporation.\r\n\r\n(M612)\r\n\r\nFinding it hopeless to obtain the Pope's sanction to his divorce from\r\nCatherine, Henry at last lost all patience, and on the 25th January, 1533,\r\nwas privately married to Anne Boleyn. The match was unpopular with the\r\ncitizens, who took occasion of a sermon preached on Easter-day to show\r\ntheir dissatisfaction. According to Chapuys, the Spanish ambassador, who\r\nsent an account of the affair to the emperor, the greater part of the\r\ncongregation got up and left the church when prayers were desired for the\r\nqueen. When Henry heard of the insult thus offered to his new bride he was\r\nfurious, and forthwith sent word to the mayor to see that no such\r\nmanifestation should occur again. Thereupon, continues Chapuys, the mayor\r\nsummoned the guilds to assemble in their various halls and commanded them\r\nto cease murmuring against the king's marriage on pain of incurring the\r\nroyal displeasure, and to order their own journeymen and servants, \"and, a\r\nstill more difficult task, their own wives,\" to refrain from speaking\r\ndisparagingly about the queen.(1169)\r\n\r\n(M613)\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps on this account that the civic authorities excelled\r\nthemselves in giving the queen a suitable reception as she passed from the\r\nTower to Westminster on the 31st May. The Court of Aldermen directed (14\r\nMay) the wardens of the Haberdashers to prepare their barge as well as the\r\n\"bachelers\" barge for the occasion. Three pageants were to be set up, one\r\nin Leadenhall and the others at the Standard and the little Conduit in\r\nCheapside. The Standard was to run with wine. A deputation was appointed\r\nto wait upon the king's council to learn its wishes, and enquiry was to be\r\nmade of the Duke of Norfolk whether the clergy should take part in the\r\nday's proceedings, and whether the merchants of the Steelyard or other\r\nstrangers should be allowed to erect pageants.(1170)\r\n\r\n(M614)\r\n\r\nThe Court of Common Council had on the previous day (13 May) voted a gift\r\nof 1,000 marks to be presented to the queen at her coronation, and a\r\nfurther sum to be expended in the city \"for the honor of the same.\"(1171)\r\nCatherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn were the only queens of king Henry\r\nVIII who were crowned, and on both occasions the citizens of London\r\nperformed the customary services.(1172)\r\n\r\n(M615)\r\n\r\nIn September (1533) Anne gave birth to a daughter, who afterwards ascended\r\nthe throne as Queen Elizabeth. In the following spring (1534) parliament\r\npassed an Act of Succession, which not only declared Elizabeth (and not\r\nMary, the king's daughter by Catherine of Aragon) heir to the crown, but\r\nrequired all subjects to take an oath acknowledging the succession.\r\nCommissioners were appointed to tender the oath to the citizens,(1173) and\r\nby the 20th April the \"most part of the city was sworn to the \"king and\r\nhis legitimate issue by the queen's grace now had and hereafter to\r\ncome.\"(1174) A fortnight later deeds under the common seals of the livery\r\ncompanies \"concernyng the suretye state and succession\" of the king were\r\ndelivered to Henry in person at Greenwich by a deputation of\r\naldermen.(1175)\r\n\r\n(M616)\r\n\r\nThe oath, nevertheless, met with much opposition, more especially among\r\nthe clergy and the religious orders. Elizabeth Barton, known as the \"holy\r\nmaid of Kent,\" and some of her followers, among them being Henry Gold,\r\nrector of the church of St. Mary Aldermary, were executed at Tyburn for\r\ndaring to speak against the king's marriage.(1176) The friars proved\r\nextremely obstinate, and Henry sent commissioners to seek out and suppress\r\nall those friaries that refused to submit.\r\n\r\n(M617)\r\n\r\nThe inmates of the London Charterhouse, who might well have been left to\r\nenjoy their quiet seclusion from the world, were startled by a visit from\r\nthe king's commissioners calling upon them to take the oath. The manner of\r\ntheir reception by John Houghton, the prior, and his brethren and\r\nsubsequent proceedings are graphically described by Maurice Chauncy,(1177)\r\none of the inmates, who was more compliant than his brethren to the king's\r\nwishes, and thereby saved his life. The prior and Humphrey Middlemore, the\r\nprocurator of the convent, were committed to the Tower for counselling\r\nopposition to the commissioners. There they were visited by the Archbishop\r\nof York and the Bishop of London, who persuaded them at last that the\r\nquestion of the succession was not a cause in which to sacrifice their\r\nlives for conscience sake. The result was that after a while Houghton and\r\nhis companion declared their willingness to submit. On the 29th May the\r\ncommissioners received oaths of fealty from Prior Houghton and five other\r\nmonks, and on the 6th June Bishop Lee and Sir Thomas Kitson, one of the\r\nsheriffs, received similar oaths from a number of priests, professed monks\r\nand lay brethren or _conversi_ belonging to the house.(1178) The oaths of\r\nobedience to the Act were given under reservation \"so far as the law of\r\nGod permitted,\" and for a time the monks were left in comparative quiet,\r\nsome few of them, of whom Cromwell entertained the most hope of\r\nsubmission, being sent, by his direction, to the convent of Sion.(1179)\r\n\r\n(M618) (M619)\r\n\r\nThe exhortations of the \"father confessor\" were not without some measure\r\nof success, several of the Carthusians being induced to alter their\r\nopinions as to the king's demands. The seal of doom, however, was fixed on\r\nthe order by the passing of the Act which called upon its members to\r\nrenounce the Pope and acknowledge the royal supremacy.(1180) Fisher and\r\nMore denied the king's title of Supreme Head of the Church, and were\r\ncommitted to the Tower. At this crisis there came to London two priors of\r\nCarthusian houses established, one in Nottinghamshire and the other in\r\nLincolnshire. They came to talk over the state of affairs with Houghton.\r\nAn interview with Cromwell, recently appointed vicar-general or king's\r\nvicegerent in matters ecclesiastical, was resolved on. The king might\r\npossibly be prevailed upon to make some abatement in his demands.\r\nCromwell, however, no sooner discovered the object of their visit than he\r\ncommitted them to the Tower as rebels and would-be traitors. As they still\r\nrefused to acknowledge the king's supremacy in the Church, in spite of all\r\nefforts of persuasion, they were brought to trial, together with Father\r\nReynolds of Sion, on a charge of treason. A verdict of guilty was, after\r\nsome hesitation on the part of the jury, found against them, and they were\r\nexecuted at Tyburn (4 May, 1535), glorying in the cause for which they\r\nwere held worthy to suffer death. Houghton's arm was suspended over the\r\ngateway of the London Charterhouse, in the fond hope that the rest of the\r\nbrethren might be awed into submission. This atrocious act of barbarism\r\nhad, however, precisely the opposite effect to that desired. The monks\r\nwere more resolute than ever not to submit, and not even a personal visit\r\nof Henry himself could turn them from their purpose.(1181) Three of them\r\nwere thereupon committed to prison, where they were compelled to stand in\r\nan upright position for thirteen days, chained from their necks to their\r\narms and with their legs fettered.(1182) They were afterwards brought to\r\ntrial on a charge of treason, convicted and executed (19 June).\r\n\r\nThe fate of the remaining monks is soon told. In May, 1537, the royal\r\ncommissioners once more attended at the Charterhouse, when they found the\r\nmajority of its inmates prepared to take the oath prescribed. Ten of them,\r\nhowever, still refused, and were committed to Newgate and there left to be\r\n\"dispatched by the hand of God,\" in other words to meet a painful and\r\nlingering death from fever and starvation. The following month the remnant\r\nof the community made their submission, and the London Charterhouse, as a\r\nmonastic institution, ceased to exist.\r\n\r\n(M620)\r\n\r\nFisher and More were now brought from the Tower, where they had lain six\r\nmonths and more, and convicted on a similar charge of treason. Their\r\nsentence was commuted to death by beheading. Fisher was the first to\r\nsuffer (19 June, 1535). His head was set up on London Bridge and his body\r\nburied in the churchyard of All Hallows, Barking. More suffered a few\r\nweeks later (6 July). His head, too, was placed on London Bridge, but his\r\nbody was buried in the Tower, whither the remains of Fisher were\r\nafterwards carried. On the 15th December the Court of Aldermen publicly\r\ncondemned a sermon preached by Fisher \"in derogation and diminution of the\r\nroyal estate of the king's majesty.\"(1183)\r\n\r\n(M621)\r\n\r\nWhen, in the following year (1536), the smaller monasteries--those of less\r\nthan L200 a year--were dissolved by Act of Parliament, and the inhabitants\r\nof Lincolnshire and Yorkshire, taking fright lest the king and Cromwell\r\nshould proceed to despoil the parish churches, set out on the Pilgrimage\r\nof Grace, Henry sought the City's aid. On the 10th October a letter from\r\nthe king was read before the Court of Aldermen, desiring them to dispatch\r\nforthwith to his manor of Ampthill, where the nobles were about to wait\r\nupon his majesty, a contingent of at least 250 armed men, 200 of which\r\nwere to be well horsed, and 100 to be archers.(1184) The mayor, Sir John\r\nAllen,(1185) lost no time in issuing his precept to the livery companies\r\nfor each of them to furnish a certain number of bowmen and billmen, well\r\nhorsed and arrayed in jackets of white bearing the City's arms. They were\r\nto muster in Moorfields within twenty-four hours. The Mercers were called\r\nupon to furnish the largest quota, viz., twenty men; the Grocers, Drapers,\r\nTailors and Cloth-workers respectively, sixteen men, and the rest of the\r\ncompanies contingents varying from twelve to two.(1186) The Court of\r\nAldermen at the same time took the precaution of depriving all priests and\r\ncurates, as well as all friars dwelling within the city, of every\r\noffensive weapon, so that they should be left with nothing but their\r\n\"meate knyves.\"(1187) The king sent a letter of thanks for the city's\r\ncontingent.(1188)\r\n\r\nLater on, when Allen had been succeeded in the mayoralty by Sir Ralph\r\nWarren,(1189) it was resolved that each member of the court should provide\r\nat his own cost and charges twenty able men fully equipped in case of any\r\nemergency that might arise, whilst the companies were again called upon to\r\nhold men in readiness.(1190)\r\n\r\n(M622)\r\n\r\nHenry in the meantime had got rid of his second wife on the specious\r\nground of her having misconducted herself with more than one member of the\r\ncourt, the real cause being her miscarriage(1191) of a male child, to the\r\nking's bitter disappointment. Henry had made up his mind to change his\r\nwives until he could find one who would give him a male heir and thus\r\nplace the succession to the crown beyond all possibility of doubt. The\r\nvery next day following Anne Boleyn's execution he married Jane Seymour.\r\nThe marriage necessitated the calling together of a new parliament, when a\r\nfresh Act was passed settling the succession on Jane's children and\r\ndeclaring both Mary and Elizabeth illegitimate. Nevertheless, as soon as\r\nMary made formal submission to her father, the king's attitude towards\r\nher, from being cold and cruel, changed at once to one of courtesy if not\r\nof affection. He was thought to entertain the idea of declaring her\r\nheir-apparent. Indeed, on Sunday, the 20th August, she was actually\r\nproclaimed as such in one of the London churches--no doubt by some\r\nmistake.(1192)\r\n\r\n(M623)\r\n\r\nWhilst parliament was sitting at Westminster convocation was gathered at\r\nSt. Paul's in the city, and continued to sit there until the 20th July,\r\npresided over by Cromwell as the king's vicar-general. The meeting was\r\nremarkable for its formal decree that Henry, as supreme head of the\r\nChurch, might and ought to disregard all citations by the Pope, as well as\r\nfor the promulgation of the ten articles intended to promote uniformity of\r\nbelief and worship.(1193)\r\n\r\n(M624) (M625)\r\n\r\nIn September, 1536, the Court of Common Council agreed to vote the same\r\nsum of money for the coronation of the \"right excellent pryncesse lady\r\nJane, quene of Englonde,\" as had been granted at the coronation of \"dame\r\nAnne, late queene of Englonde.\"(1194) The money, however, was not\r\nrequired, for the new queen was never crowned. Just one week after the\r\nbirth of a prince (12 Oct., 1537), afterwards King Edward VI, there was a\r\nsolemn procession of priests from every city church, with the Bishop of\r\nLondon, the choir of St. Paul's, the mayor, aldermen and crafts in their\r\nliveries, for the preservation of the infant prince and for the health of\r\nthe queen, who lay in a precarious state.(1195) A few days later (24 Oct.)\r\nshe was dead. The citizens caused her obit to be celebrated in St. Paul's\r\nwith truly regal pomp.(1196)\r\n\r\n(M626) (M627)\r\n\r\nTwo years later the citizens were preparing to set out to Greenwich in\r\ntheir barge (the mayor, aldermen, and those who had served the office of\r\nsheriff, in liveries of black velvet with chains of gold on their necks,\r\naccompanied by their servants in coats of russet) to welcome Anne of\r\nCleves, who landed at Dover the 27th December, 1539.(1197) On the 3rd\r\nFebruary, 1540, the Court of Aldermen was informed that the king and queen\r\nwould be leaving Greenwich on the morrow for Westminster, and that it was\r\nthe king's wish that the commons of London should be in their best\r\napparel, in their barges, to wait upon his highness, meeting at St.\r\nDunstan's in the East at 7 o'clock in the morning and arriving at\r\nGreenwich by 8 o'clock.(1198)\r\n\r\n(M628)\r\n\r\nThe insurrection which had taken place in the country under the name of\r\nthe Pilgrimage of Grace was seized by the king as an excuse for\r\nsuppressing many of the larger monasteries and confiscating their\r\nproperty. He had no such excuse for carrying out his destructive policy in\r\nthe city. Nevertheless, under the immediate supervision of Cromwell, the\r\nwork of suppression went on, and before the end of 1538 was well nigh\r\ncomplete. The surrender of the houses of the Black Friars, the Grey Friars\r\nand the White Friars followed in quick succession, \"and so all the other\r\nimmediatlie.\"(1199) Cromwell by this time had removed from his house near\r\nFenchurch to another near the Austin Friars in Throgmorton Street. He had\r\nrecently asked for a pipe of water to be laid on to his new house, and\r\nthis the Common Council had \"lovingly\" granted.(1200) In his private\r\nconcerns he showed as little regard for the rights of others as in the\r\naffairs of State. He did not scruple to remove bodily a small house, the\r\nproperty of Stow's father, in order to enlarge his own garden, giving\r\nneither warning beforehand nor explanation afterwards, and \"no man durst\r\ngo to argue the matter.\"(1201)\r\n\r\nThe hospital of St. Thomas of Acon, which had ministered to the wants of\r\nthe poorer citizens for nearly 400 years, disappeared,(1202) and was soon\r\nfollowed by the priory and hospital of St. Bartholomew, an institution of\r\neven greater antiquity, the hospital of St. Thomas, in Southwark, the\r\npriory and hospital of St. Mary without Bishopsgate, known as St. Mary of\r\nBethlem, or \"Bedlam,\" and the Abbey of Graces or New Abbey (sometimes\r\ncalled the Eastminster to distinguish it from the other minster in the\r\nwest of London) which had been founded by Edward III, near Tower Hill.\r\n\r\n(M629)\r\n\r\nA portion of the spoil was, as we have already seen, distributed among\r\ncourt favourites. The site of the house and gardens of the Augustinian\r\nFriars in Broad Street Ward was occupied, soon after their suppression (12\r\nNov., 1538), by the mansion-house of that politic courtier the celebrated\r\nMarquis of Winchester, who managed to maintain himself in high station in\r\nspite of the changes which took place under the several reigns of Henry\r\nVIII, Edward VI, Mary, and Elizabeth, \"by being a willow and not an oak.\"\r\nThe building known at the present day as Winchester House, in Broad\r\nStreet, stands near the site of the old mansion-house and garden of\r\nWilliam Paulet, first Marquis of Winchester. The Friars' church he allowed\r\nto stand; and in June, 1550, the nave was granted, by virtue of a charter\r\npermitting alien non-conforming churches to exist in this country, to the\r\nDutch and Walloon churches.(1203) The first marquis dying in 1571, he was\r\nsucceeded by his son, who sold the monuments and lead from the roof of the\r\nremaining portion of the church and turned the place into a stable.(1204)\r\nThe fourth marquis was reduced to parting with his house, built on the\r\nsite of the old priory, in order to pay his debts, and appears to have\r\nfound a purchaser in a wealthy London merchant and alderman of the city,\r\nJohn Swinnerton or Swynarton.(1205)\r\n\r\n(M630)\r\n\r\nThe steeple of the church, which was of so great beauty that the citizens\r\ndesired its preservation,(1206) was sold by the marquis to Henry Robinson,\r\nwho forthwith set to work to pull it down on the ground that it was in\r\nsuch a state of decay as to be a danger to the passer-by. Swinnerton, who\r\nhappened to be mayor at the time, ordered him to stay the work of\r\ndemolition; he, however, not only hurried on the more, but obstructed the\r\nofficers sent to put a stop to the work, for which he was committed to\r\nNewgate to stay there until he gave security for restoring what he had\r\nalready pulled down. The thought suggests itself that the fact of\r\nSwinnerton having purchased adjacent property may have made him the more\r\nzealous in preventing the demolition of the steeple than perhaps he might\r\notherwise have been. However that may be, he lost no time in informing the\r\nlords of the council of the state of affairs and asking their advice (16\r\nFeb., 1612). The reply came three days later, and was to the effect that\r\nas the City had had the option of purchasing the steeple at even a less\r\nprice than Robinson had paid for it, and might have come to some\r\narrangement with the marquis to keep it in repair, it could not prevent\r\nRobinson, who purchased it as a speculation, making the best he could of\r\nhis bargain; so that, unless the City consented to accept Robinson's offer\r\nto part with his property on payment of his purchase-money and\r\ndisbursements within a fortnight, down the steeple must come.(1207)\r\n\r\n(M631)\r\n\r\nThe priory of St. Helen without Bishopsgate was one of the last to be\r\nsurrendered. In 1542 the nuns' chapel, which at one time was partitioned\r\noff from the rest of the church, was made over to Sir Richard Williams, a\r\nnephew of Thomas Cromwell, and ancestor of the Protector. The nuns'\r\nrefectory or hall passed into the hands of the Leathersellers' Company and\r\nformed the company's hall until the close of the last century. The conduct\r\nof the inmates of the priory had not always been what it should be.(1208)\r\nThe last prioress, in anticipation of the coming storm, leased a large\r\nportion of the conventual property to members of her own family, and at\r\nthe time of the suppression was herself allowed a gratuity of L30 and a\r\npension.\r\n\r\n(M632)\r\n\r\nThe relations existing between the civic authorities and the religious\r\nhouses in the city were often of a most friendly and cordial character.\r\nWhen, in 1520, the Friars of the Holy Cross wanted assistance for the\r\nmaintenance and building of their church, they applied to the Corporation\r\nas being their \"secund founders.\"(1209) For assistance thus given the\r\nfriars bound themselves to pray for their benefactors. When, in 1512, the\r\nmaster of St. Bartholomew's hospital obtained a lease for ninety-nine\r\nyears from the City of a parcel of land on which his gatehouse or porch\r\nstood, it was on condition of payment of a certain rent and of his keeping\r\na yearly obit in his church for the souls of the mayor, aldermen and\r\ncommons of the city; and when the master of the hospital, two years later,\r\nattempted to back out of the terms of his lease and asked to be discharged\r\nfrom keeping the obit on the ground that he thought that the payment of\r\nthe specified rent was sufficient for the premises, the Court of Aldermen\r\nunanimously decided that no part of the agreement should be minished or\r\nremitted.(1210) When the house of the Sisters Minoresses or Poor Clares,\r\nsituate in Aldgate, suffered from fire, the Corporation rendered them\r\npecuniary aid to the extent of 300 marks.(1211)\r\n\r\nIt was, however, to the Franciscans or Grey Friars that the citizens of\r\nLondon, individually as well as in their corporate capacity, were more\r\nespecially attached. Soon after their arrival in England in 1223, they\r\nbecame indebted to the benevolence and generosity of citizens, their first\r\nbenefactor having been John Ewen, citizen and mercer, who made them a gift\r\nof some land and houses in the parish of St. Nicholas by the Shambles.\r\nUpon this they erected their original building. Their first chapel, which\r\nbecame the chapel of their church, was built at the cost of William\r\nJoyner, who was mayor in 1239; the nave was added by Henry Waleys, who was\r\nfrequently mayor during the reign of Edward I; the chapterhouse by Walter\r\nle Poter, elected sheriff in 1272; the dormitory by Gregory de Rokesley,\r\nwho was mayor from 1274 to 1281, and again in 1284-5, and whose bones\r\neventually found a resting place in their church; the refectory by another\r\ncitizen, Bartholomew de Castro; and lastly--coming to later times--a library\r\nwas added to their house by the bounty of Richard Whitington, as already\r\nnarrated. It became the custom for the mayor and aldermen, as patron and\r\nfounders, to pay a yearly visit to their house and church on St. Francis's\r\nday (4 Oct.). The custom dates from 1508. In 1522 the visit was for the\r\nfirst time followed by a dinner.(1212)\r\n\r\n(M633)\r\n\r\nIn one respect at least, if in no other, Cromwell's action in suppressing\r\nreligious houses resulted in a benefit to the city of London as well as to\r\nthe country at large, and this was in the institution of parish registers,\r\nnot only for baptisms, but also for marriages. It had been his intention\r\nto establish them in 1536 to remedy the inconvenience to the public\r\narising from the suppression of the smaller monasteries, and it is evident\r\nthat some instructions were given at this time, inasmuch as the registers\r\nof two city parishes--viz., St. James Garlickhithe and St. Mary\r\nBothaw--commence in November of this year,(1213) although the royal\r\ninjunction commanding that registers should systematically be kept up,\r\nunder penalty of fines, was not published by Cromwell, as vicar-general,\r\nuntil the 29th September, 1538. The delay is to be accounted for by the\r\ngreat discontent which the rumour of his project excited in the country.\r\nIt was reported that some new tax on the services of the Church was\r\ncontemplated, and the first in the list of popular grievances circulated\r\nby the rebels in the Pilgrimage of Grace was the payment of tribute to the\r\nking for the sacrament of baptism. In course of time, as matters became\r\nquieter and the government began to feel its own strength, Cromwell\r\nresumed a project never altogether abandoned, and caused the injunction to\r\nbe issued, an action for which posterity must ever be deeply grateful.\r\n\r\n(M634)\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the sudden closing of these institutions caused the\r\nstreets to be thronged with the sick and poor, and the small parish\r\nchurches to be so crowded with those who had been accustomed to frequent\r\nthe larger and more commodious churches of the friars that there was\r\nscarce room left for the parishioners themselves. The city authorities saw\r\nat once that something would have to be done if they wished to keep their\r\nstreets clear of beggars and of invalids, and not invite the spread of\r\nsickness by allowing infected persons to wander at large. As a means of\r\naffording temporary relief, collections for the poor were made every\r\nSunday at Paul's Cross, after the sermon, and the proceeds were\r\ndistributed weekly among the most necessitous,(1214) but more\r\ncomprehensive steps were required to be taken.\r\n\r\n(M635)\r\n\r\nSir Richard Gresham,(1215) who was mayor at the time (1537-8), took upon\r\nhimself to address a letter(1216) to the king setting forth that there\r\nwere three hospitals in the city, viz., St. Mary's Spital, St.\r\nBartholomew's and St. Thomas's, besides the New Abbey on Tower\r\nHill--institutions primarily founded \"onely for the releffe, comforte and\r\nhelpyng of pore and impotent people not beyng able to helpe theymselffes;\r\nand not to the mayntenannce of Chanons, Preests, and Monks to lyve in\r\npleasure, nothyng regardyng the miserable people liyng in every strete,\r\noffendyng every clene person passyng by the way with theyre fylthy and\r\nnasty savours\"--and asking that the mayor and aldermen of the city for the\r\ntime being might have the order and disposition of the hospitals\r\nmentioned, and of all the lands, tenements and revenues appertaining to\r\nthe same. If his grace would but grant this request the mayor promised\r\nthat a great number of the indigent sick would be relieved, whilst \"sturdy\r\nbeggars\" not willing to work would be punished.\r\n\r\n(M636) (M637)\r\n\r\nIn March, 1539, the City presented two petitions to the king, one desiring\r\nthat the late dissolved houses might be made over to them, together with\r\ntheir rents and revenues, in order that relief might be provided for the\r\nsick and needy, and the other asking that Henry would be pleased to convey\r\nto them the churches of the late four orders of friars, together with\r\ntheir lands and tenements, so that the mayor and citizens might take order\r\nfor the due performance of divine service therein to the glory of God and\r\nthe honour of the king.(1217) These petitions having been either refused\r\nor ignored, the Court of Common Council, on the 1st August, 1540,\r\nauthorised the mayor and aldermen to make diligent suit to the king for\r\nthe purchase of the houses, churches, and cloisters of the dissolved\r\nfriars, and to make an offer of 1,000 marks for them \"yf thei can be\r\ngotten no better chepe.\"(1218) Henry upbraided the City for being \"pynche\r\npence\" or stingy in their offer,(1219) but as no better offer was made the\r\nmatter was allowed to stand over, and nothing was done for four years.\r\n\r\n(M638)\r\n\r\nHenry meanwhile took the opportunity afforded him by a full treasury,\r\nwhich rendered him independent of the favour of the citizens, of robbing\r\nthem of their right of measuring linen-cloth and other commodities, and\r\nconferring the same by letters patent on John Godsalve, one of the clerks\r\nof the signet. The City's right was incontestable, and had been admitted\r\nby the king's chancellor, as well as by the Chancellor of the Court of\r\nFruits and Tenths (a court recently established), and the mayor and\r\naldermen represented the facts of the case to the king himself by letter,\r\ndated the 21st July, 1541.(1220) Another \"variance\" occurred about this\r\ntime between the City and the Crown touching the office and duties of the\r\nCity's waterbailiff.(1221)\r\n\r\nAgain, in the spring of 1542, an incident occurred which caused the\r\nrelations between parliament and the City to be somewhat strained. The\r\nsheriffs of that year--Rowland Hill,(1222) an ancestor of the founder of\r\nthe Penny Post, and Henry Suckley--had thought fit to obstruct the\r\nsergeant-at-mace in the execution of his duty, whilst attempting to remove\r\na prisoner, who was a member of parliament, from one of the compters. The\r\narrest of a member of parliament has always been a hazardous operation,\r\nand the sheriffs after a time thought better of it and gave up their\r\nprisoner. The Speaker, nevertheless, summoned them to appear at the Bar of\r\nthe House and finally committed them to the Tower. They were released\r\nafter two or three days, however, at the humble suit of the mayor.(1223)\r\n\r\n(M639)\r\n\r\nIn the following year (1543) the plague returned, and extra-precautions\r\nhad to be taken against the spread of the disease, now that the houses of\r\nthe friars were no longer open to receive patients and to alleviate\r\ndistress. Besides the usual order that infected houses should be marked\r\nwith a cross, the mayor caused proclamation to be made that persons of\r\nindependent means should undergo quarantine for one month after recovery\r\nfrom sickness, whilst others whom necessity compelled to walk abroad for\r\ntheir livelihood were to carry in their hands white rods, two feet in\r\nlength, for the space of forty days after convalescence. Straw and rushes\r\nin an infected house were to be removed to the fields before they were\r\nburnt, and infected clothing was to be carried away to be aired and not to\r\nbe hung out of window. The hard-heartedness engendered by these\r\nvisitations is evidenced by the necessity of the mayor having to enjoin\r\nthat thenceforth no householder within the city or liberties should put\r\nany person stricken with the plague out of his house into the street,\r\nwithout making provision for his being kept in some other house. All dogs\r\nother than hounds, spaniels or mastiffs kept for the purpose of guarding\r\nthe house were forthwith to be removed out of the city or killed, whilst\r\nwatch-dogs were to be confined to the house.(1224) In October the mayor\r\nwas ordered to resume the weekly bills of mortality, which of late had\r\nbeen neglected, in order that the king might be kept informed as to the\r\nincrease or decrease of the sickness.(1225) The Michaelmas Law Sittings\r\nhad to be postponed until the 15th November, and were removed to St.\r\nAlbans.(1226)\r\n\r\n(M640)\r\n\r\nWhilst the city was being wasted by disease the king was preparing for war\r\nwith France.(1227) A joint expedition by Henry and Charles was to be\r\nundertaken in the following year (1544). A commission was issued early in\r\nthe year for raising money in the city, and the lord chancellor himself,\r\naccompanied by officers of State, came into the city to read it. Finding\r\nthat the lord mayor's name appeared third on the commission instead of\r\nbeing placed at its head, the chancellor ordered the mistake to be at once\r\nrectified by the town clerk and a new commission to be drawn up, whilst\r\nthe rest of the lords agreed that at their several sessions on the\r\nbusiness of this subsidy the lord mayor should occupy the seat of\r\nhonour.(1228) By the end of April the chancellor (Audley) had died. His\r\nsuccessor, Lord Wriothesley, had not long been appointed before the Court\r\nof Aldermen sent a deputation to desire his lordship's favour and\r\nfriendship in the city's affairs, and agreed to make him a present of a\r\ncouple of silver-gilt pots to the value of L20 or thereabouts.(1229) On\r\nthe 24th May the Common Council agreed to provide a contingent of 500 or\r\n600 men at the discretion of the mayor and aldermen, the men being raised\r\nfrom the livery companies.(1230)\r\n\r\n(M641)\r\n\r\nJust as the king was about to set sail for the continent, he issued\r\nletters patent (23 June, 1544) re-establishing the hospital of St.\r\nBartholomew on a new foundation, with the avowed object of providing\r\n\"comfort to prisoners, shelter to the poor, visitation to the sick, food\r\nto the hungry, drink to the thirsty, clothes to the naked, and sepulture\r\nto the dead.\"(1231)\r\n\r\n(M642)\r\n\r\nHenry crossed over to France, leaving the new queen, Catherine Parr, widow\r\nof Lord Latimer, whom he had recently married, regent of the realm. After\r\na long siege, lasting from July until September, he succeeded in taking\r\nBoulogne. On Thursday, the 25th September, an order was received by the\r\nCourt of Aldermen from the lord chancellor, on behalf of the queen regent,\r\nto get in readiness another contingent of 500 men well harnessed and\r\nweaponed, 100 of whom were to be archers and the rest billmen. The last\r\nmentioned were to be provided with \"blak bylles or morys pykes.\" The whole\r\nforce was to be ready for shipment to Boulogne by the following Saturday.\r\nNo time was to be lost. The wardens of the city companies were immediately\r\nsummoned, and each company was ordered to provide the same number of men\r\nas on the last occasion. Each soldier was to be provided with a coat of\r\ngrey frieze, with half sleeves, and a pair of new boots or else \"sterte\r\nupps.\" The Corporation for its part appointed five captains, to each of\r\nwhom was given the sum of L10 towards his apparel and charges, whilst L5\r\nwas allowed to each petty captain. These sums were paid out of the \"goods\"\r\nof the mayor and commonalty.(1232)\r\n\r\nScarcely had the city recovered from this drain upon its population before\r\nit was again called upon to fill up the ranks of the army in France. On\r\nSaturday, the 25th October, the Court of Aldermen was ordered to raise\r\nanother force of 500 men by the following Monday. It was no easy matter to\r\ncomply with so sudden a demand. The city companies were called upon to\r\ncontribute as before, any deficiency in the number of men raised by them\r\nbeing made up by men raised by the mayor and aldermen themselves in a\r\nsomewhat novel fashion. The Court of Aldermen had agreed that each of\r\ntheir number should on the Saturday night make the round of his ward and\r\nselect \"fifty, forty, twenty, or ten\" tall and comely men, who should be\r\nwarned in the king's name to appear the next morning before seven o'clock\r\nat the Guildhall. On Sunday morning the mayor and aldermen came to the\r\nGuildhall, and took the names of those whom they had selected over night.\r\nTwo hundred men were eventually set apart to make up the deficiency of\r\nthose to be provided by the companies. By six o'clock in the evening the\r\nwhole contingent of 500 men was thus raised, and at nine o'clock on Monday\r\nmorning they mustered at Leadenhall, whence they were conducted by the\r\nsheriffs and city chamberlain to the Tower Hill and handed over to Sir\r\nThomas Arundel, who complimented the civic authorities on the appearance\r\nof the men, and promised to commend their diligence to the king.(1233)\r\nThis same Monday morning (27 Oct.) the mayor received instructions to see\r\nthat such carpenters and other artificers as had been \"prested\" for the\r\nking's service at Boulogne by the king's master-carpenter kept their day\r\nand presented themselves at the time and place appointed on pain of\r\ndeath.(1234) Search was ordered to be made in the following month for\r\nmariners lurking in the city, and if any were discovered they were to be\r\nforthwith despatched to the ships awaiting them.(1235)\r\n\r\n(M643)\r\n\r\nBy this time the king had ceased to take a personal part in the campaign\r\nand had returned home, the mayor and aldermen giving him a hearty welcome,\r\nand making him a suitable present in token of their joy for his return and\r\nhis success in effecting the surrender of Boulogne.(1236)\r\n\r\n(M644)\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the next year (1545) Henry demanded another benevolence\r\nafter the rate of two shillings in the pound. The lord chancellor and\r\nothers of the king's council sat at Baynard's Castle to collect the\r\nbenevolence of the city, \"callinge all the citizens of the same before\r\nthem, begininge first with the mayor and aldermen.\"(1237) Richard Rede,\r\nalderman of the ward of Farringdon Without, resisted this demand as\r\nunconstitutional, and was promptly despatched to the king in Scotland,\r\nwhere he was shortly afterwards made a prisoner of war. Another alderman,\r\nSir William Roche, of Bassishaw ward, was unfortunate enough to offend the\r\ncouncil and was committed to the Fleet.(1238)\r\n\r\n(M645)\r\n\r\nOn the 8th February William Laxton, the mayor, was presented to the king\r\nat Westminster, when Henry took occasion to thank him and his brother\r\naldermen for the benevolence they had given him. He informed them of the\r\nsuccess that had recently attended the English forces under the Earl of\r\nHertford and the lord admiral, Sir John Dudley, whom he had left as deputy\r\nof Boulogne, and dismissed them to their homes after conferring upon the\r\nmayor the honour of knighthood.(1239)\r\n\r\n(M646)\r\n\r\nIn the following April volunteers were called for, and those in the city\r\nwilling to follow the fortunes of war as \"adventurers\" were asked to\r\nrepair to the sign of the \"Gunne,\" at Billingsgate, where they would\r\nreceive directions from John of Caleys, captain of all such adventurers,\r\nfor their passage to France.(1240) The sessions of the law courts were\r\nadjourned in order to give lawyers and suitors an opportunity of showing\r\ntheir patriotism by taking up arms.(1241) The city companies furnished 100\r\nmen appareled \"with whyte cotes of penystone whytes(1242) or karsies,\"\r\nwith a red cross of St. George before and behind, each being provided with\r\na white cap to wear under his \"sallett or scull.\"(1243)\r\n\r\n(M647)\r\n\r\nThere yet remained a portion of the last subsidy to be collected, for\r\nwhich purpose the lord chancellor once more paid a visit to the city (12\r\nJune) and sat in the Guildhall. Every alderman was straitly charged to\r\ncall before him every person in his ward who was worth L40 and upwards.\r\nThe king's affairs were pressing, and this last payment must be\r\nimmediately forthcoming.(1244)\r\n\r\n(M648)\r\n\r\nA week later (19 June) letters from the king were read to the Court of\r\nAldermen touching the levying of more forces and firing of beacons--a\r\nFrench squadron had appeared off the south coast. It was resolved to\r\nadjourn consideration of the message until the following Monday, when the\r\nlord chancellor and other lords of the council would again be coming into\r\nthe city for the subsidy, and their advice could be asked. The outcome of\r\nthese letters was that the City had to raise a force of 2,000 able men. To\r\ndo this an assessment of a fifteenth was ordered to be levied on the\r\nwards, but in the meantime the money so to be raised was to be advanced by\r\nthe aldermen.(1245) Not only were the aldermen on this, as on other\r\noccasions, mulcted in their pocket, but they were also called upon to\r\npersonally share with the lord mayor himself and the sheriffs in the extra\r\nwatch which in the \"besye tyme of the warres\" was ordered to be kept in\r\nthe city.(1246) In the meantime a man was despatched by the Court of\r\nAldermen to St. James' Fair to buy five wey of cheese for the city's\r\nsoldiers who were already at Guildford. The cheese was to be sent by water\r\nas far as Kingston, whence it would be conveyed by \"the good industrye and\r\nhelp of Master Judde, alderman,\" to its destination. The bakers of\r\nStratford contracted to send two cart-loads of bread. It was further\r\nagreed on the same day that Christopher Fowlke should forthwith go to\r\nGuildford, and further if need be, \"to guyde the seyd vytayle and to utter\r\nthe same to the souldyers by thassistence of the sworde berer and the\r\nunder chamberleyn. And to recyve money for the same.\"(1247) A flag and a\r\ndrum were likewise to be despatched forthwith. The citizen soldiers were\r\nrequired to assist in driving out the French, who had effected a landing\r\nin the Isle of Wight; but before they arrived the enemy had\r\ndisappeared.(1248)\r\n\r\n(M649)\r\n\r\nThe French king now prepared to lay siege to Boulogne, and the citizens\r\nwere again called upon to furnish soldiers. One thousand men were\r\nrequired, and this number was only raised by enlisting men who had failed\r\nto pass previous musters. However, there was no time to pick and\r\nchoose.(1249)\r\n\r\n(M650)\r\n\r\nBy this time Henry's resources were fast giving out. A parliament was\r\nsummoned to meet in November, and again resort was had to confiscation for\r\nthe purpose of supplying the king with money. An Act was passed which\r\nplaced 2,000 chantries and chapels and over 100 hospitals at Henry's\r\ndisposal.(1250)\r\n\r\n(M651)\r\n\r\nAll parties were, however, tired of the war, and in the following June\r\n(1546) a peace was concluded. Henry was allowed to retain Boulogne as\r\nsecurity for a debt, and the French admiral soon afterwards paid a visit\r\nto the city, where he was heartily welcomed and hospitably\r\nentertained.(1251)\r\n\r\n(M652) (M653)\r\n\r\nFreed from the embarrassment of foreign wars, Henry now had leisure to\r\nturn his attention to home affairs, and more particularly to the\r\nestablishment of that uniformity which he so much desired, and which he\r\nendeavoured to bring about by getting rid of all those who differed in\r\nopinion from himself. Those who openly declared their disbelief in any one\r\nof the \"Six Articles,\" and more particularly in the first article, which\r\nestablished the doctrine of the real presence, ran the risk of death by\r\nthe gallows, the block or the stake. A city rector, Dr. Crome, of the\r\nchurch of St. Mary Aldermary, got into disgrace for speaking lightly of\r\nthe benefits to be derived from private masses, and, although his argument\r\ntended to minimise the effect of the recent confiscation of so many\r\nchantries, he was called upon to make a public recantation at Paul's\r\nCross.(1252)\r\n\r\n(M654)\r\n\r\nOthers were not so compliant. Among these was Anne Ascue or Ascough, a\r\ndaughter of Sir William Ascough, of Kelsey, in Lincolnshire, and sometimes\r\nknown as Anne Kyme, from the name of her husband, with whom she had ceased\r\nto live. In June, 1545, she and some others, among whom was another woman,\r\nJoan, wife of John Sauterie, of London, had been arraigned at the\r\nGuildhall \"for speaking against the sacrament of the altar\"; but, no\r\nevidence being adduced against her, she was on that occasion acquitted and\r\ndischarged.(1253) Scarcely a year elapsed before she was again in custody.\r\nOn the 18th June, 1546, she was tried at the Guildhall and condemned to be\r\nburned alive as a heretic at Smithfield, where the city chamberlain had\r\norders to erect a \"substantial stage,\" whence the king's council and the\r\ncivic authorities might witness the scene.(1254)\r\n\r\n(M655)\r\n\r\nThe insanitary condition of the city, occasioned for the most part by an\r\ninsufficient supply of water, was not improved by the influx of disbanded\r\nand invalided soldiers, followed by a swarm of vagabonds and idlers, which\r\ntook place at the conclusion of peace with France. To the soldiers\r\nlicences were granted to solicit alms for longer or shorter periods,\r\nwhilst the vagabonds were ordered to quit the city.(1255) The water\r\nquestion had been taken in hand by the Common Council towards the close of\r\nthe preceding year (1545), when Sir Martin Bowes entered upon his\r\nmayoralty, and a tax of two fifteenths was imposed upon the inhabitants of\r\nthe city for the purpose of conveying fresh water from certain \"lively\r\nsprynges\" recently discovered at Hackney.(1256) Bowes himself was very\r\nenergetic in the matter, and before he went out of office he had the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing a plentiful supply of water brought into the heart\r\nof the city from the suburban manor of Finsbury.(1257)\r\n\r\n(M656)\r\n\r\nHenry's reign was now fast drawing to a close. In April, 1546, he had\r\nbestowed an endowment of 500 marks a year on the city poor-houses on\r\ncondition the citizens themselves found a similar sum.(1258) In January,\r\n1547--a few days only before he died--he showed still further care for the\r\ncity poor by vesting in the Corporation, not only St. Bartholomew's\r\nHospital, thenceforth to be known as the House of the Poor in West\r\nSmithfield, but also the house and church of the dissolved monastery of\r\nthe Grey Friars and the house and hospital of Bethlehem.(1259)\r\n\r\n(M657)\r\n\r\nThe Corporation lost no time in getting their newly acquired property into\r\nworking order. On the 6th May the late king's conveyance was read before\r\nthe Court of Aldermen, and thereupon a committee, of which Sir Martin\r\nBowes was a prominent member, was deputed to make an abstract of the\r\nyearly revenues and charges of the house of the Grey Friars and hospital\r\nof little Saint Bartholomew, and to report thereon to the court with as\r\nmuch speed as possible.(1260) From a purely monetary point of view the\r\nCity had made a bad bargain, and had saddled itself with an annual\r\nexpenditure out of the Corporation revenues to an extent little thought of\r\nat the time.(1261)\r\n\r\n(M658)\r\n\r\nOn the 28th January, 1547, Henry died \"at hys most pryncely howse at\r\nWestminster, comenly called Yorkeplace or Whytehall\"--the palace which\r\nCardinal Wolsey built for himself, and which Henry appropriated, extending\r\nits grounds and preserves in cynical contempt of public convenience and\r\nutter disregard of the chartered rights of the citizens of London.(1262)\r\nThere his corpse remained until the 14th February, when it was removed at\r\n8 o'clock in the morning to Sion House, near Richmond, and thence conveyed\r\nto Windsor on the following day.\r\n\r\n(M659)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the mayor, Henry Huberthorne, or Hoberthorne,(1263) had\r\nbeen sent for (31 Jan.) to attend the king's council at Westminster, where\r\nhe received orders to return to the city and cause himself and his brother\r\naldermen to be arrayed in their scarlet robes, in order to accompany the\r\nheralds whilst they proclaimed the new king in various parts of the city.\r\nThis being done, the mayor took steps for securing the peace of the city,\r\nand the citizens voted Edward a benevolence of a fifteenth and a\r\nhalf.(1264)\r\n\r\n(M660)\r\n\r\nEdward on his part presented the mayor and aldermen with 104 gowns of\r\nblack livery, according to the precedent followed at the decease of Henry\r\nVII. These gowns were distributed among the mayor and aldermen, the high\r\nofficers and certain clerks in the service of the Corporation. Ten\r\naldermen accompanied the remains of the late king on their way to Windsor,\r\nriding forth in black coats with the rest of the mourners, the harness and\r\nbridles of their horses being covered with black cloth. Two of the\r\naldermen, Sir William Laxton and Sir Martin Bowes, had each four servants\r\nin their suite, whilst the rest of the aldermen had three, all in black\r\ncoats.(1265)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(M661)\r\n\r\nProvision had been made for the succession to the crown on Henry's death\r\nby an Act of Parliament passed in 1544, and the princesses Mary and\r\nElizabeth were thereby re-instated in their rights of inheritance as if no\r\nquestion of their legitimacy had ever been raised. As Edward, who was next\r\nin succession to the crown, was but a boy, Henry had taken pains to select\r\na council of regency in which no one party should predominate. This\r\ncouncil was soon set aside, and Hertford, the king's uncle, got himself\r\nappointed Protector of the realm and took the title of Duke of Somerset.\r\nAt the time of his father's death Edward was residing at Hertford Castle.\r\nHe was soon afterwards carried thence by his uncle to London and lodged in\r\nthe Tower, where the mayor, Henry Hoberthorne, went to pay his respects\r\nand received the honour of knighthood.(1266)\r\n\r\nOn the 19th the young king passed through the city to Westminster, the\r\nmayor riding before him bareheaded with the mace of crystal(1267) in his\r\nhand. The streets were lined with members of the livery companies. The\r\nconduits, the standard and cross in Chepe, the Ludgate and the Temple Bar\r\nhad been freshly painted and trimmed with goodly hangings of Arras and\r\ncloth of gold for the occasion. At three of the conduits, namely, the\r\nconduit in Cornhill, the great conduit in Chepe, and the conduit in Fleet\r\nStreet, wine was made by artificial means to flow as if from the\r\n\"festrons\" of the conduits themselves. At the little conduit in Chepe were\r\nstationed the aldermen of the city, in their scarlet gowns, and the\r\nRecorder, who, in the name of the whole city, presented his majesty with\r\n1,000 marks in \"hole new sufferaynes\" of gold in a purse of purple cloth\r\nof gold, which his majesty deigned to accept with his own hand. The next\r\nday Edward was crowned. The lord mayor, according to custom, attended with\r\nhis crystal mace as the king passed from his palace to church, and thence,\r\nafter mass, to Westminster Hall, and received for his services the\r\ncustomary gold cup, which on this occasion weighed twenty ounces, with its\r\ncover and a \"leyer\" (or laver) silver-gilt weighing six ounces.(1268)\r\n\r\n(M662)\r\n\r\nThe work of reformation was now about to be taken seriously in hand.\r\nSomething, it is true, had been done in this direction under Henry, but in\r\n_dilettante_ fashion. The ceremony connected with the boy-bishop, which\r\neven Colet had thought worthy to be perpetuated in his school,(1269) had\r\nbeen abolished by order of the mayor in 1538.(1270) The ruthless\r\ndestruction of the shrine of St. Thomas at Canterbury, and the erasure of\r\nhis name from service-books, had been followed in the city by an order\r\n(1539) for a new common seal on which the arms of the city were\r\nsubstituted for the original effigy of the saint.(1271) Henry himself only\r\ncoquetted with Protestantism; his chief object, if not the only one, was\r\nto get rid of the papal supremacy; but among the bourgeois class of the\r\ncity there was an earnest desire to see an improvement made in the\r\ndoctrine and discipline of the Church.(1272)\r\n\r\nWhilst the statute of the Six Articles was still unrepealed, the sacrament\r\nof the mass frequently provoked open hostility in the city. Thus, in\r\nAugust, 1538, Robert Reynold, a stationer, was declared upon the oath of\r\nfive independent witnesses to have been heard to say \"that the masse was\r\nnawght, and the memento was Bawdrye, and after the consecracioun of the\r\nmasse yt was idolatrye.\" He was further charged with having said that it\r\nwere better for him to confess and be houseled by a temporal rather than a\r\nspiritual man.(1273) Again, in February, 1543, Hugh Eton, a hosier of\r\nLondon, was convicted of disguising himself \"in fonde fassyon,\" and of\r\nirreverently walking up and down in St. Bride's Church before the\r\nsacrament, disturbing the priests at mass and creating a tumult. By way of\r\npunishment for his offence he was set in the cage in Fleet Street,\r\n\"disguised\" as he was, with a paper on his head setting forth his offence.\r\nHe there remained until four o'clock in the afternoon, when he was removed\r\nto the compter and condemned to stay there a prisoner until he found\r\nsureties for good behaviour.(1274)\r\n\r\nAfter the repeal of the statute by Edward's first parliament, the\r\nopposition to the \"sacrament of the altar,\" as the mass was called, became\r\ngreater than ever.(1275) A boy was ordered to be whipt naked in the church\r\nof St. Mary Woolnoth for throwing his cap at the host at the time of\r\nelevation.(1276) In February, 1548, information was given to the Court of\r\nAldermen of preachers having used \"certain words\" touching the mass in the\r\nchurches of St. Dunstan in the east and St. Martin Orgar.(1277) On the 5th\r\nMay, 1548, the mayor and aldermen resolved to appear the next day before\r\nthe Lord Protector Somerset and the council, and explain the nature of the\r\nmisdemeanours of certain preachers, concerning which the mayor had already\r\nhad some communication with the Archbishop of Canterbury.(1278)\r\n\r\nIn the following month (5 June) the Court of Aldermen investigated a\r\ncharge made against a city curate that, about a month before, after\r\nreciting the common prayers at the choir door at high mass, he had prayed\r\namong other things that Almighty God might send the king's council grace\r\nand bring them out of the erroneous opinions that they were then in. The\r\ninformer went on to say that Sir Clement Smith and the Recorder, who were\r\npresent, laughed at the prayer. But inasmuch as the informer had not been\r\npresent himself, and that what he had laid before the court was mere\r\nhearsay evidence, little attention was paid to it.(1279)\r\n\r\n(M663)\r\n\r\nThe abolition of chantries initiated by Henry VIII was carried out to a\r\nfuller extent by his successor. The statute (1 Edward VI, cap 14) by which\r\nthis was effected not only deprived a large number of priests of a means\r\nof livelihood, but laid them open to insult from those they met in the\r\nstreet. They complained that they could not walk abroad nor attend the\r\ncourt at Westminster without being reviled and having their tippets and\r\ncaps violently pulled.(1280)\r\n\r\n(M664)\r\n\r\nThe same statute--by declaring all chantries, obits, lights and lamps to be\r\nobjects of superstitious use, and all goods, chattels, jewels, plate,\r\nornaments and other moveables hitherto devoted to their maintenance to be\r\nthenceforth escheated to the Crown--dealt a heavy blow to the Corporation\r\nof the City of London, as well as to the civic companies and other bodies\r\nwho owned property subject to certain payments under one or other of these\r\nheads. Three years after the passing of the Act the Corporation and the\r\ncompanies redeemed certain charges of this character on their respective\r\nproperties to the amount of L939 2_s._ 5-1/2_d._ by payment to the Crown\r\nof no less a sum than L18,744 11_s._ 2_d._(1281)\r\n\r\nThe redemption of these and other charges of a similar character, whilst\r\nvery convenient to the Crown, saving the trouble and expense of collecting\r\nsmall sums of money, worked a hardship upon the Corporation and the\r\ncompanies. In order to raise funds for redeeming the charges they were\r\nobliged to sell property. This property was often held under conditions of\r\nreverter and remainders over, unless what was now declared to be illegal\r\nwas religiously carried out. It was manifestly unfair that they should be\r\nmade to forfeit property because the conditions under which it was held\r\ncould no longer be legally complied with. A petition therefore was\r\npresented to the king in order to obviate this difficulty, and to enable\r\nthem to part with the necessary property and at the same time to give a\r\nclear title.(1282)\r\n\r\n(M665)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime (Aug., 1547) an order had gone forth for the demolition of\r\nall images and removal of pictures and stained glass from churches. The\r\ninstructions sent to the lord mayor were very precise. \"Stories made in\r\nglasse wyndows\" relative to Thomas Becket were to be altered at as little\r\nexpense as possible. Images and pictures to which no offerings and no\r\nprayers were made might remain for \"garnisshement\" of the churches; and if\r\nany such had been taken down the mayor was at liberty to set them up\r\nagain, unless they had been taken down by order of the king's\r\ncommissioners or the parson of the church. If there existed in any church\r\na \"storye in glasse\" of the Bishop of Rome, otherwise the Pope, the mayor\r\nmight paint out the papal tiara and alter the \"storye.\"(1283) These\r\ninstructions, contained in a letter from the king's council, were duly\r\nconsidered at a Court of Aldermen held on the 22nd September, with the\r\nresult that every alderman was ordered, in the most secret, discreet and\r\nquiet manner he could devise, to visit each parish church in his ward, and\r\nto take with him the parson or curate and two or three honest\r\nparishioners, churchwardens or others who had had anything to do with the\r\nremoval of the images that had already been taken down, and, having shut\r\nthe church door for the sake of privacy, to take a note in writing of what\r\nimages had formerly been in the several churches, what images had\r\nofferings and were prayed to, and what not; who had removed those taken\r\ndown, and what had been done with them. A report was to be made on these\r\npoints by every alderman at the next court, so that the lords of the\r\ncouncil might be informed thereon and their will ascertained before any\r\nfurther steps were taken.(1284)\r\n\r\nThe havoc worked by the king's commissioners in the city and throughout\r\nthe country by the reckless destruction of works of art was terrible. The\r\nchurches were stripped of every ornament, their walls whitewashed, and\r\nonly relieved by the tables of the commandments. Early in September the\r\ncommissioners visited St. Paul's and pulled down all the images. In\r\nNovember the rood was taken down with its images of the Virgin and St.\r\nJohn. The great cross of the rood fell down accidentally and killed one of\r\nthe workmen, a circumstance which many ascribed to the special\r\nintervention of the Almighty. From St. Paul's the commissioners proceeded\r\nto the church of St. Bride, and so from parish church to parish\r\nchurch.(1285)\r\n\r\nIn the following year (1548) the chapel of St. Paul's charnel house was\r\npulled down and the bones removed into the country and reburied. From a\r\nsanitary point of view their removal is to be commended. There is no such\r\nexcuse, however, for the destruction of the cloister in Pardon churchyard\r\n(April, 1549), with its famous picture of the Dance of Death, painted at\r\nthe expense of John Carpenter, the town clerk of the city, of whom mention\r\nhas already been made. The fact was that the Protector Somerset required\r\nmaterial for building his new palace in the Strand,(1286) to enlarge which\r\nhe had already pulled down Strand Church, dedicated to Saint Mary and the\r\nHoly Innocents.(1287) The destruction of the cloister necessitated a new\r\norder of procession on the next Lord Mayor's Day (24 Oct.), when Sir\r\nRowland Hill paid the customary visit to St. Paul's, made a circuit of the\r\ninterior of the cathedral, and said a _De profundis_ at the bishop's\r\ntomb.(1288)\r\n\r\n(M666)\r\n\r\nNor can the civic authorities themselves be altogether acquitted of\r\nvandalism. They destroyed the churches of St. Nicholas Shambles and St.\r\nEwin, and sold the plate and windows, but the proceeds were distributed\r\namong the poor.(1289) They went further than this. They removed the fine\r\ntombs and altars, as well as the choir stalls, from the church of the Grey\r\nFriars, where mingled the ashes of some of the noblest and best in the\r\nland. There was some excuse, however, for these acts. The house and church\r\nof the Grey Friars had been granted to the City at the close of the last\r\nreign on the express condition that the churches of St. Nicholas and St.\r\nEwin should be abolished, and that the church of the Grey Friars should be\r\nestablished as a parish church in their place under the name of Christ\r\nChurch. It was probably in order to render the old monastic church more\r\nconvenient as a parish church that they removed much of what to the\r\nantiquary of to-day would have seemed of priceless value, and at the same\r\ntime reduced the dimensions of the choir.(1290)\r\n\r\n(M667)\r\n\r\nAt Easter, 1548, a new communion service in English took the place of the\r\nmass.(1291) At the election of the mayor on the following Michaelmas-day,\r\non which occasion a mass had always been celebrated at the Guildhall\r\nChapel since the time of Whitington, an endeavour appears to have been\r\nmade by the Court of Aldermen to effect a compromise between mass and\r\ncommunion, for whilst it ordered that a mass of the Holy Ghost should be\r\nsolemnly sung in English in the Guildhall Chapel (which had been\r\nconfiscated by Henry VIII)(1292) as theretofore, it further ordered that\r\nthe holy communion should be administered to two or three of the priests\r\nthere at the same mass.(1293) Orders were issued by the king's council\r\nthat candles should no longer be carried about on Candlemas-day, ashes on\r\nAsh Wednesday, palms on Palm Sunday. These practices were now considered\r\nsuperstitious, as also was the \"sensyng\" which hitherto had taken place in\r\nSt. Paul's at Whitsuntide, but which the Court of Aldermen now decreed to\r\nbe abolished, and the preaching of sermons substituted in its place.(1294)\r\n\r\n(M668)\r\n\r\nThe people were at this time extremely distracted by the various and\r\ncontradictory opinions of their preachers; and as they were totally\r\nincapable of judging of the force of arguments adduced on one side or the\r\nother, but conceived that everything spoken from the pulpit was of equal\r\nauthority, great confusion and perplexity of mind ensued. In order to\r\n\"tune the pulpits\" and to effect uniformity of doctrine and service, the\r\nLord Protector resorted to proclamations, which, although no longer having\r\nthe authority of statutes as in the reign of Henry VIII, practically\r\nanswered the same purpose. Preaching was thus restricted to those who had\r\npreviously obtained a licence from the king, his visitors, the archbishop\r\nof Canterbury, or the bishop of the diocese.(1295) The same want of\r\nuniformity which appeared in the preachers appeared also in their\r\ncongregations; some \"kepte holy day and manny kepte none, but dyd worke\r\nopynly, and in some churches servys and some none, soche was the\r\ndevysyon.\"(1296)\r\n\r\n(M669)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime great discontent had been caused by the Protector's\r\nmeasures. The rich nobleman and country gentleman said nothing, for their\r\nassent had been purchased by gifts of church property, but the tenants and\r\nbourgeois class suffered from increased rents, from enclosures and\r\nevictions. Church lands had always been underlet; the monks were easy\r\nlandlords. Not so the new proprietors of the confiscated abbey lands, they\r\nwere determined to make the most out of their newly-acquired\r\nproperty.(1297) Insurrection broke out in various parts of the country.\r\nNot only were enclosures thrown open and fences removed, but a cry was\r\nraised for the restoration of the old religion. Information of what was\r\ntaking place was sent to Sir Henry Amcotes, the mayor, and steps were at\r\nonce taken (2 July, 1549) for putting the city into a state of defence and\r\nfor the preservation of the king's peace. A \"false draw-brydge\" was\r\nordered (_inter alia_) to be made for London Bridge \"in case nede should\r\nrequyer by reason \"of the sterrynge of the people (which God defende!) to\r\ncaste downe thother.\"(1298) The city gates were constantly watched and the\r\nwalls mounted with artillery.(1299)\r\n\r\n(M670)\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these preparations there was a lull. On the 21st day of\r\nJuly, being the 6th Sunday after Trinity, came Archbishop Cranmer to St.\r\nPaul's. He wore no vestment save a cope over an alb, and bore neither\r\nmitre nor cross, but only a staff. He conducted the whole of the service\r\nas set out in the \"king's book\" recently published, which differed but\r\nslightly from the church service in use at the present day, and he\r\nadministered the \"Communion\" to himself, the dean and others, according to\r\nAct of Parliament. The mayor and most of the aldermen occupied seats in\r\nthe choir. Cranmer's object in coming to the city on that day was to\r\nexhort the citizens to obey the king as the supreme head of the realm, and\r\nto pray the Almighty to avert the trouble with which, for their sins, they\r\nwere threatened.(1300)\r\n\r\n(M671)\r\n\r\nTwo days later (23 July) the king himself left Greenwich and rode through\r\nthe city to Westminster, accompanied by the Lord Protector and other\r\nnobles. The mayor and aldermen rode out to Southwark, the former in a gown\r\nof crimson velvet, the latter in gowns of scarlet, to meet the royal\r\nparty, and conducted it as far as Charing Cross, where the aldermen took\r\ntheir leave, the king saluting them and \"putting of his capp to everie of\r\nthem.\" The mayor rode on to Westminster, where the king and the Protector\r\ngraciously bade him farewell.(1301)\r\n\r\n(M672)\r\n\r\nThe aspect of affairs began to look black indeed. By the end of the month\r\nExeter was being besieged by the rebels, and on the 8th August the French\r\nambassador, taking advantage of the general distraction, bade the Lord\r\nProtector open defiance at Whitehall.(1302) At midnight instructions were\r\nsent to the mayor to seize all Frenchmen in the city who were not\r\ndenizens, together with their property. By this time, however, Exeter had\r\nbeen relieved and the insurrection in the west had been put down. The\r\nwestern insurgents had demanded the restoration of the mass and the\r\nabolition of the English liturgy. Contemporaneously with this religious\r\nmovement another agitation was being made in the eastern counties, and\r\nmore especially in Norfolk, which had for its object the destruction of\r\nenclosures. With the eastern rebels, who placed themselves under the\r\nleadership of Robert Ket, a tanner of Wymondham, the Protector himself\r\nsympathized at heart, and the council had to exercise no little pressure\r\nbefore he could be induced to send an efficient force to put them down. At\r\nlength the rebels were met and defeated by a force under the command of\r\nthe Earl of Warwick, the son of the extortionate Dudley who was associated\r\nwith Empson in oppressing the city towards the close of the reign of Henry\r\nVII. Ket galloped off the field, leaving his followers to be ridden down\r\nand killed by the earl's horsemen. He was shortly afterwards captured in a\r\nbarn, and eventually brought up to London, together with his brother\r\nWilliam, and committed to the Tower. Being arraigned and convicted of\r\ntreason, they were handed over to the high sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk.\r\nRobert was hanged in chains on the top of Norwich Castle, whilst his\r\nbrother William suffered a similar fate on the top of Wymondham\r\nSteeple.(1303)\r\n\r\n(M673)\r\n\r\nSomerset's fall was now imminent. The citizens hated him, not for his\r\nfavouring the reformers, but for the injury he had caused to trade and for\r\nhis having bebased the coinage still further than it had been debased by\r\nHenry VIII. His colleagues in the council, who had been pampered with\r\ngifts of church lands, were angry with him for the favour he had shown\r\ntowards those who raised the outcry against enclosures, and they began to\r\nshow their independence.\r\n\r\n(M674)\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of Sunday, the 6th October, 1549, a letter was sent to\r\nthe mayor subscribed by Lord St. John, the president of the council, the\r\nearls of Warwick, Southampton and Arundel, and other members of the\r\ncouncil, containing a long indictment of the Protector's policy and\r\nconduct. He was proud, covetous and ambitious. He had embezzled the pay of\r\nthe soldiers, with which he was building sumptuous houses in four or five\r\ndifferent places. Whilst sowing discord among the nobles, he flattered the\r\ncommons to the intent that, having got rid of the former, he might with\r\nthe aid of the latter achieve his scarcely veiled design of supplanting\r\nthe king himself. They had hoped, the letter continues, to have persuaded\r\nthe duke by fair means to take order for the security of the king's person\r\nand the commonwealth; but no sooner was the matter broached to the duke\r\nthan he showed himself determined to appeal to the arbitrament of the\r\nsword. Such being the case, they on their part were no less resolved, with\r\nGod's help, to deliver the king and the realm from impending ruin, or\r\nperish in the attempt. They concluded by asking the civic authorities to\r\nsee that good watch and ward were kept in the city and that no _materiel_\r\nof war was supplied to the duke or his followers. Any letters or\r\nproclamations coming from the Protector were to be disregarded.(1304)\r\n\r\n(M675)\r\n\r\nDetermined not to be forestalled by his enemies; the duke himself wrote\r\nthe same day (6 Oct.) to the mayor desiring the City to furnish him\r\nforthwith with 1,000 trusty men fully armed for the protection of the\r\nking's person. The men were to be forwarded to him at Hampton by the\r\nfollowing Monday mid-day at the latest, and in the meantime the citizens\r\nwere to take steps to protect the king and his uncle, the duke, against\r\nconspiracy.(1305)\r\n\r\n(M676)\r\n\r\nBefore these letters had been despatched the mayor and aldermen had been\r\nsummoned by the Earl of Warwick, who now took the lead against Somerset,\r\nto meet him and other lords of the council at his house in Ely Place,\r\nHolborn. A meeting had accordingly taken place that Sunday morning, when\r\nthe state of affairs was discussed. After the meeting separated Warwick\r\ncame to the city and took up his residence in the house of Sir John York,\r\none of the sheriffs, situate in Walbrook. Sir John Markham, lieutenant of\r\nthe Tower, was removed, and Sir Leonard Chamberlain appointed in his\r\nplace, whilst the Court of Aldermen took extraordinary precautions for\r\nsafe-guarding the city.(1306)\r\n\r\n(M677)\r\n\r\nAs soon as Somerset was made aware of the Tower being in the possession of\r\nhis rivals he removed from Hampton Court to Windsor, carrying the young\r\nking with him, and despatched a letter to Lord Russell to hurry thither\r\nwith such force as he could muster.(1307)\r\n\r\n(M678)\r\n\r\nOn Monday (7 Oct.) the lords of the council sat at Mercers' Hall--they felt\r\nsafer in London--and thence despatched a dutiful letter to the king, and\r\nanother (explaining their conduct) to Cranmer.(1308) The Common Council\r\nmet at seven o'clock that morning, having been warned on Sunday\r\nnight.(1309) The object of their meeting so early in the day was that no\r\ntime might be lost before taking into consideration the letters that had\r\nbeen received from Somerset and from the lords. After due deliberation the\r\ncitizens agreed to throw in their lot with the lords and to assist them\r\n\"to the uttermost of their wills and powers\" in the maintenance and\r\ndefence of the king's person.(1310)\r\n\r\n(M679)\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday (8 Oct.) the Common Council again assembled in the Guildhall to\r\nmeet the lords by appointment. Rumour had been spread to the effect that\r\nit was the intention of the lords to cause a reestablishment of the old\r\nreligion.(1311) This the lords assured the meeting was far from their\r\nminds. They intended no alteration of matters as established by the laws\r\nand statutes. All they wanted was to cause them to be maintained as\r\nformerly, before they had been \"disformed\" by the Lord Protector, and for\r\nthis they prayed the assistance of the citizens. Thereupon the mayor,\r\naldermen and common council, thanking God for the good intentions of their\r\nlordships, \"promised their ayde and helpe to the uttermost of their lieves\r\nand goodes.\"(1312)\r\n\r\n(M680) (M681)\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday (9 Oct.) the lords met at the house of Sheriff York, where\r\nthey had dined the previous day.(1313) They had heard that Somerset had\r\nseized all the armour, weapons and munitions of war he could lay his hands\r\nupon, both at Hampton Court and Windsor, and with them had armed his\r\nadherents. They again sent letters to the king, the archbishop and others,\r\nand declared Somerset to be unworthy to continue any longer in the\r\nposition of Protector.(1314) The Common Council, which met the same\r\nday--\"for divers urgent causes moved and declared by the mouth of the\r\nrecorder and of the lord mayor and aldermen on the king's behalf\"--agreed\r\nto furnish with all speed 500 men, or if necessary 1,000 men, well\r\nharnessed and weaponed, to proceed to Windsor Castle for the delivery and\r\npreservation of his majesty. It was subsequently arranged that 100 of the\r\ncontingent should be horsemen.(1315) By the afternoon of Friday (11 Oct.)\r\nthe men and horsemen were ready. They mustered in Moorfields, whence they\r\nmarched through Moorgate, Coleman Street, Cheapside, and out by Newgate to\r\nSmithfield, with the Sword-bearer riding before them as captain. At\r\nSmithfield they broke off, and were discharged from further service for\r\nthe time.(1316) There is no evidence to show that the force was ever\r\ncalled upon to proceed to Windsor.\r\n\r\n(M682) (M683)\r\n\r\nThe adhesion of the City to the lords had in the meanwhile added strength\r\nto their cause, many who had at first held back now declaring themselves\r\nagainst Somerset. In this manner they were joined by Lord Chancellor Rich,\r\nthe Earl of Shrewsbury, Chief Justice Montague and others, whose\r\nsignatures appear to a proclamation issued on the 8th October setting\r\nforth \"the verye trowth of the Duke of Somersettes evell government and\r\nfalse and detestable procedynges.\"(1317) By the end of the week (12 Oct.)\r\nthe lords felt themselves strong enough to proceed in person to Windsor,\r\nwhere on their knees they explained their conduct to the king, who\r\nreceived them graciously and gave them hearty thanks. The following day\r\n(Sunday) was spent in removing some of Somerset's followers; and on Monday\r\n(14th) Somerset himself was brought prisoner to London, \"riding through\r\nOldborne in at Newgate and so to the Tower of London, accompanied with\r\ndiuers lordes and gentlemen with 300 horse, the lord maior, Sir Ralph\r\nWarren, Sir John Gresham, Mr. Recorder, Sir William Locke and both the\r\nshiriffes and other knights, sitting on their horses agaynst Soper-lane,\r\nwith all the officers with halbards, and from Oldborne bridge to the Tower\r\ncertaine aldermen or their deputies on horsebacke in every streete, with a\r\nnumber of housholders standing with bils as hee passed.\"(1318)\r\n\r\nAt the sudden fall of one who for a short time had been all powerful--a\r\nlittle more than a week had served to deprive him of the protectorate and\r\nrender him a prisoner in the Tower--did it cross the mind of any of the\r\nonlookers that he it was who carried away from the Guildhall Library some\r\ncartloads of books which were never returned?\r\n\r\n(M684)\r\n\r\nThere were some who looked upon Somerset's fall as an act of God's\r\nvengeance for his having caused Bonner to be deprived of his bishopric of\r\nLondon. On the 1st September last Bonner had preached at Paul's Cross\r\nagainst the king's supremacy. Information of the matter was given to the\r\ncouncil, and Bonner was called upon to answer for his conduct before\r\nCranmer and the rest of the commissioners. The informers on this occasion\r\nwere William Latymer, the parson of the church of St. Laurence Pountney,\r\nand John Hooper, a zealous Protestant, who afterwards became Bishop of\r\nGloucester. Whilst under examination before the commissioners Bonner was\r\nconfined in the Marshalsea. Hooper in the meantime was put up by Cranmer\r\nto preach at Paul's Cross, and he took the opportunity thus afforded him\r\nof inveighing strongly against Bonner's conduct. Bonner failed to satisfy\r\nthe commissioners, and on the 1st October was deprived of office and\r\ncommitted to prison during the king's pleasure. \"But marke what\r\nfolloweth,\" writes the chronicler of the Grey Friars, within a week \"was\r\nproclaymyd the protector a traytor.\"(1319)\r\n\r\n(M685)\r\n\r\nOn the 17th October Edward came from Hampton Court to Southwark Place, a\r\nmansion formerly belonging to Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, when it\r\nwas known as Suffolk House. It was now used in part as a mint, and was\r\noccupied by Sheriff York in his capacity as master of the king's mint.\r\nAfter dinner the king knighted York in recognition of his hospitality and\r\nhis past services, an honour personal to York and not extended to his\r\ncolleague in the shrievalty, Richard Turke. From Southwark Edward set\r\nforth to ride through the city to Westminster, accompanied by a long\r\ncavalcade of nobles and gentlemen, \"the lord mayor bearinge the scepter\r\nbefore his maiestie and rydinge with garter kinge of armes.\"(1320)\r\n\r\n(M686)\r\n\r\nSomerset's confinement in the Tower was not of long duration. On the 6th\r\nFebruary, 1550, the lieutenant of the Tower received orders to bring his\r\nprisoner \"with out greate garde or busyness\" to Sheriff York's house in\r\nWalbrook, where the council was sitting; and on the duke entering into a\r\nrecognisance to remain privately either at Shene or Sion, and not to\r\ntravel more than four miles from either place, nor attempt to gain an\r\ninterview with the young king, he was allowed to depart.(1321)\r\n\r\n(M687)\r\n\r\nWith Warwick, who became the ruling spirit of the council after the fall\r\nof Somerset and the abolition of the protectorate, religion was a matter\r\nof supreme indifference, and for a time it was uncertain whether he would\r\nfavour the followers of the old religion or the advanced reformers. He\r\nchose to extend his patronage to the latter. The day after Somerset's\r\nrelease from the Tower, Bonner was again brought from the Marshalsea,\r\nwhere he had been roughly used,(1322) and the cause of his deprivation\r\nreconsidered by the lords of the council sitting in the Star Chamber, the\r\nresult being that the previous sentence by Cranmer was confirmed and\r\nBonner again relegated to prison. Bishops were now appointed directly by\r\nthe king, who in the following April caused Nicholas Ridley, bishop of\r\nRochester, to be transferred to London in Bonner's place; and the see of\r\nWestminster,(1323) which had been created in 1540, was united to London.\r\nIn July Hooper was nominated to the see of Gloucester; but some time\r\nelapsed before this rigid reformer could be induced to overcome his\r\nprejudice to episcopal vestments (which he denounced as the livery of\r\nAnti-Christ) and consent to be consecrated in them.(1324) As soon as the\r\nceremony was over he cast them off.\r\n\r\n(M688)\r\n\r\nFor some time past the City had experienced difficulty in exercising its\r\nfranchise in the borough of Southwark. That borough consisted of three\r\nmanors, known respectively as the Guildable Manor, the King's Manor and\r\nthe Great Liberty Manor.(1325) The first of these--and only the first--had\r\nbeen granted to the City by Edward III soon after his accession. The civic\r\nauthorities had complained of felons making good their escape from the\r\ncity to Southwark, where they could not be attacked by the officers of the\r\ncity; and the king, in answer to the City's request, had made over to them\r\nthe town or vill of Southwark.(1326) This grant was afterwards confirmed\r\nand amplified by a charter granted by Edward IV in 1462, whereby the\r\ncitizens were allowed to hold a yearly fair in the borough on three\r\nsuccessive days in the month of September, together with a court of\r\npie-powder, and with all liberties and customs to such fair\r\nappertaining.(1327) In course of time the City claimed the right of\r\nholding a market, as well as the yearly fair, twice a week in Southwark.\r\nThis claim now led to difficulties with the king's bailiff, Sir John Gate.\r\nA draft agreement had been drawn up during Somerset's protectorate in the\r\nhopes of arranging matters,(1328) but apparently without success.\r\n\r\n(M689)\r\n\r\nAt length the city agreed (29 March, 1550) to make an offer of 500 marks\r\nfor the purchase of the rights of the Crown in Southwark,(1329) and\r\neventually a compromise was effected. For the sum of L647 2_s._ 1_d._ the\r\nking conveyed by charter(1330) to the City of London divers messuages in\r\nSouthwark, with the exception of \"Southwark Place\" and the gardens\r\nbelonging to it, formerly the Duke of Suffolk's mansion, and for a further\r\nsum of 500 marks he surrendered all the royal liberties and franchises\r\nwhich he or his heirs might have in the borough or town of Southwark. It\r\nwas expressly provided that this charter was not to be prejudicial to Sir\r\nJohn Gate or to his property and interests. The ancient rent of L10 per\r\nannum was still to be paid, and the citizens were to be allowed to hold\r\nfour markets every week in addition to a fair and court of pie-powder\r\nenjoyed since the time of Edward IV. On the 9th May the lord mayor took\r\nformal possession of the borough of Southwark by riding through the\r\nprecinct, after which the Common Cryer made proclamation with sound of\r\ntrumpet for all vagabonds to leave the city and borough and the suburbs\r\nand liberties of the same.(1331)\r\n\r\n(M690)\r\n\r\nIt was originally intended, no doubt, that the borough should be\r\nincorporated for all municipal purposes with the city, and that the\r\ninhabitants of the borough should be placed on the same footing as the\r\ncitizens. This, however, was never carried out. Notwithstanding the fact\r\nthat among the ordinances drawn up (31 July) for the government of the\r\nborough,(1332) there was one which prescribed the same customary procedure\r\nin the election of an alderman for the new ward of Bridge Without as\r\nprevailed in the city;(1333) the inhabitants of the borough have never\r\ntaken any part in the election of an alderman. The first alderman, Sir\r\nJohn Aylyff, a barber-surgeon, was \"nominated, elected and chosen\" by the\r\nCourt of Aldermen,(1334) and was admitted and sworn before the same body\r\non the 28th May, 1850--that is to say, some weeks before the ordinances\r\njust mentioned were drawn up.\r\n\r\nThe alderman of the ward continued to be nominated and elected by the\r\nCourt of Aldermen until 1711, when, by virtue of an Act of Common Council,\r\nthe ward was to be offered to the several aldermen who had served as\r\nmayor, in order of seniority. If no alderman could be found willing to be\r\ntranslated from his own ward to that of Bridge Without, the Court of\r\nCommon Council was empowered by another Act passed in 1725 to proceed to\r\nthe election of an alderman.\r\n\r\nThe ward of Bridge Without has never sent representatives to the Common\r\nCouncil, inasmuch as its inhabitants refused to \"take up their freedom\"\r\nand bear the burdens of citizenship, and there existed no means for\r\nforcing the freedom upon them. In 1835, however, a petition was presented\r\nto the Common Council by certain inhabitants of Southwark asking that they\r\nmight for the future exercise the right of electing not only an alderman,\r\nbut common council-men for the ward, and that the ordinances of 1550 might\r\nbe carried out according to their original intention. The petition was\r\nreferred to the Committee for General Purposes, who reported to the Common\r\nCouncil(1335) to the effect that, considering that the borough of\r\nSouthwark had never formed part of the City of London, the charter of\r\nEdward VI notwithstanding, and that the holding of wardmotes in the\r\nborough would materially interfere with the duties of an ancient officer\r\nknown as a seneschal or steward of Southwark, the petition could not be\r\ncomplied with, except by application to the legislature, and that such a\r\ncourse would neither be expedient or advisable. Another petition to the\r\nsame effect has quite recently been presented to the Court of Aldermen;\r\nbut it was equally unsuccessful.(1336)\r\n\r\n(M691)\r\n\r\nWarwick had not long taken the place of Somerset before he found himself\r\ncompelled to make peace with France (29 March, 1550). This he accomplished\r\nonly by consenting to surrender Boulogne. The declaration of peace was\r\ncelebrated with bonfires in the city, although the conditions under which\r\nthe peace was effected were generally unacceptable to the nation and\r\nbrought discredit upon the earl.(1337) One result of the conclusion of the\r\nwar was again to flood the streets of the city with men who openly\r\ndeclared that they neither could nor would work, and that unless the king\r\nprovided them with a livelihood they would combine to plunder the city,\r\nand once clear with their booty they cared not if 10,000 men were after\r\nthem. It was in vain that proclamation was made for all disbanded soldiers\r\nto leave the city. They refused to go, and oftentimes came into conflict\r\nwith the city constables. At length the mayor and aldermen addressed a\r\nletter on the subject to the lords of the council (25 Sept.).(1338)\r\n\r\n(M692)\r\n\r\nIn the following year the state of the city was rendered worse by a\r\nproposal of Warwick to debase the currency yet more. As soon as the\r\nproposal got wind up went the price of provisions, in spite of every\r\neffort made by the lords of the council to keep it down. They sent for the\r\nmayor (Sir Andrew Judd) to attend them at Greenwich on Sunday, the 10th\r\nMay, and soundly rated him--or, as the chronicler puts it, \"gave him some\r\nsore words\"--for allowing such things to take place. On Thursday, the 28th,\r\nthe mayor summoned a Common Council, when the Recorder repeated to them\r\nthe king's orders that the price of wares was not to be raised. The livery\r\ncompanies were to see to it, and there were to be no more\r\nmurmurings.(1339)\r\n\r\nWarwick himself excited the anger of the city burgesses by riding through\r\nthe streets to see if the king's orders against the enhancement of the\r\nprice of victuals were being carried out. Coming one day to a butcher's in\r\nEastcheap, he asked the price of a sheep. Being told that it was 13\r\nshillings, he replied that it was too much and passed on. When another\r\nbutcher asked 16 shillings he was told to go and be hanged. The earl's\r\nconduct so roused the indignation of the butchers of the city--a class of\r\nmen scarcely less powerful than their brethren the fishmongers--that they\r\nmade no secret that the price of meat would be raised still more if the\r\ndebasement of the currency was carried out as proposed.(1340) Yet, in\r\nspite of all remonstrances and threats, a proclamation went forth that\r\nafter the 17th August the shilling should be current for six pence\r\nsterling and no more, the groat for two pence, the penny for a halfpenny,\r\nand the halfpenny for a farthing.(1341) The price of every commodity rose\r\n50 per cent. as a matter of course, and nothing that Warwick could do\r\ncould prevent it. Seeing at last the hopelessness of attempting to\r\novercome economic laws by a mere _ipse dixit_, he caused a \"contrary\r\nproclamasyon\" to be issued, and \"sette alle at lyberty agayne, and every\r\nviteler to selle as they wolde and had done before.\"(1342)\r\n\r\n(M693)\r\n\r\nWarwick's increasing unpopularity raised a hope in the breast of Somerset\r\nof recovering his lost power. Some rash words he had allowed to escape\r\nwere carried to the young king, who took the part of Warwick against his\r\nown uncle, and showed his appreciation of the earl's services by creating\r\nhim Duke of Northumberland (11 Oct.). A few days later Somerset was seized\r\nand again committed to the Tower.(1343) The new duke vaunted himself more\r\nthan ever, and as a fresh coinage was on the eve of being issued, he\r\ncaused it to be struck with a ragged staff, the badge of his house, on its\r\nface.(1344) Some of the duke's servants thought to ruffle it as well as\r\ntheir master, and offered an insult to one of the sheriffs, attempting to\r\nsnatch at his chain of office as he accompanied the mayor to service at\r\nSt. Paul's on All Saints' Day, and otherwise creating no little\r\ndisturbance in St. Paul's Churchyard. The mayor waited until service was\r\nover, and then took them into custody.(1345)\r\n\r\n(M694)\r\n\r\nAt the time of Somerset's second arrest the Common Council and the wardens\r\nof the several livery companies were summoned to meet at the Guildhall to\r\nhear why the duke had been sent for the second time to the Tower, and to\r\nreceive instructions for safe-guarding the city. They were informed by the\r\nRecorder that it had been the duke's intention to seize the Tower and the\r\nIsle of Wight, and to \"have destroyed the city of London and the\r\nsubstantiall men of the same.\"(1346) This was, of course, an exaggeration,\r\nalthough there is little doubt that the duke was preparing to get himself\r\nnamed again Protector by the next parliament. On the 1st December he was\r\nbrought from the Tower by water to Westminster, the mayor and aldermen\r\nhaving received strict orders to keep the city well guarded.(1347) He was\r\narraigned of treason and felony, but his judges, among whom sat his enemy\r\nNorthumberland himself, acquitted him of the former charge, and those in\r\nthe hall, thinking he had been altogether acquitted, raised a shout of joy\r\nthat could be heard as far as Charing Cross and Long Acre. When they\r\ndiscovered that he had been found guilty of felony and condemned to be\r\nexecuted they were grievously disappointed. As he landed at the Crane in\r\nthe Vintry on his way back to the Tower that evening, and passed through\r\nCandlewick (Cannon) Street, the people, we are told, cried \"'God save him'\r\nall the way as he went, thinkinge that he had clerely bene quitt, but they\r\nwere deceyved, but hoopinge he should have the kinge's pardon.\"(1348)\r\nAccording to another chronicler there were mingled cries of joy and sorrow\r\nas he passed through London, some crying for joy that he was acquitted,\r\nwhilst others (who were better informed of the actual state of the case)\r\nlamented his conviction.(1349) His execution took place on Tower Hill in\r\nJanuary of the next year (1552).\r\n\r\n(M695)\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the civic authorities had been energetically engaged in\r\nmaking regulations for the hospital of the poor in West Smithfield, better\r\nknown as St. Bartholomew's Hospital, which they had recently acquired, and\r\nin grappling with the poverty and sickness with which they were\r\nsurrounded. Instead of trusting to the charity of those attending the\r\nparish churches on Sunday for raising money for the poor, the Common\r\nCouncil, in September, 1547, resorted to the less precarious method of\r\nlevying on every inhabitant of the city one half of a fifteenth for the\r\nmaintenance of the poor of the hospital.(1350) The voluntary system,\r\nhowever, was not wholly abolished. In the following April (1548) a\r\nbrotherhood for the relief of the poor had been established, to which the\r\nmayor (Sir John Gresham) and most of the aldermen belonged, each agreeing\r\nto subscribe a yearly sum varying from half a mark to a mark.(1351) In\r\nSeptember governors were appointed of St. Bartholomew's Hospital--four\r\naldermen and eight commoners(1352)--and in the following December the\r\nCommon Council passed an Act for the payment of 500 marks a year to the\r\nhospital, the sum being levied on the livery companies.(1353)\r\n\r\n(M696)\r\n\r\nIn 1551 the City succeeded in obtaining another hospital. This was the\r\nhospital in Southwark originally dedicated to Thomas Becket, but whose\r\npatron saint was, after the Reformation, changed to St. Thomas the\r\nApostle. Negotiations were opened in February with the lord chancellor for\r\nthe purchase of this hospital.(1354) They proceeded so favourably that by\r\nthe 12th August the hospital and church and part of their endowment were\r\nconveyed to the City by deed, whilst the rest of the endowment was\r\ntransferred by another deed on the following day.(1355) The purchase-money\r\namounted to nearly L2,500.\r\n\r\n(M697)\r\n\r\nHaving thus cared for the sick and the poor, the civic authorities next\r\nturned their attention to the conversion of a portion of the ground and\r\nbuildings of the dissolved monastery of the Grey Friars into a hospital\r\nfor the reception and education of fatherless and helpless children. In\r\n1552 Sir Richard Dobbs(1356) was mayor. He took an active part in the\r\ncharitable work that was then being carried on in the city, and his\r\nconduct so won the heart of Ridley that the bishop wrote from prison\r\nshortly before his death commending him in the highest possible terms:--\"O\r\nDobbs, Dobbs, alderman and knight, thou in thy year did'st win my heart\r\nfor evermore, for that honourable act, that most blessed work of God, of\r\nthe erection and setting up of Christ's Holy Hospitals, and truly\r\nreligious houses which by thee and through thee were begun.\" In July the\r\nwork of adapting the old buildings, rather than erecting new, was\r\ncommenced, and in a few months the premises were sufficiently forward to\r\nadmit of the reception of nearly 400 children. The charity was aided by\r\nthe king's bestowal of the linen vestures used in the city prior to the\r\nReformation, and at that time seized by the commissioners.(1357) Just as\r\nthe close of the reign of Henry VIII had witnessed the reopening of the\r\nchurch of the Grey Friars under the name of Christchurch, and the\r\ncelebration of the mass once more within its walls, so now the close of\r\nhis son's short reign witnessed the restoration of their house and\r\nbuildings, and their conversion, in the cause of education and charity,\r\ninto Christ's Hospital.\r\n\r\n(M698)\r\n\r\nThere was yet another class of inhabitant to be provided for, namely,\r\nthose who either could not or would not work. On behalf of these a\r\ndeputation(1358) was appointed by the City to present a petition to the\r\nking that he would be pleased to grant the disused palace of Bridewell to\r\nthe municipality for the purpose of turning it into a workhouse. The\r\ndeputation was introduced by Ridley, who himself wrote in May of this year\r\n(1552) to secretary Cecil on the same subject.(1359) The efforts of the\r\nbishop and the deputation were rewarded with success. In the following\r\nspring (1553) the king not only consented to convey the palace to the\r\nmunicipal body, but further gave 700 marks and all the beds and bedding of\r\nhis palace of the Savoy for the maintenance of the workhouse.(1360) The\r\nCity having thus become possessed of the several hospitals of St.\r\nBartholomew, St. Thomas, Christ's and Bridewell, the king, a few days\r\nbefore his death, granted the mayor, aldermen and commonalty a charter of\r\nincorporation as governors of these Royal Hospitals in the city.(1361)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(M699)\r\n\r\nThe death of Edward VI took place on the 6th July, 1553, although it was\r\nnot generally known until two days afterwards. By his father's will the\r\nPrincess Mary became heiress to the throne. Northumberland was aware of\r\nthis. He was equally aware that if Mary succeeded to her brother's crown\r\nmatters might go hard with him. He therefore persuaded Edward to follow\r\nthe precedent set by his father and re-settle the succession to the crown\r\nby will. He succeeded moreover in getting the late king to name as his\r\nsuccessor the Lady Jane Grey, grand-daughter of Mary Duchess of Suffolk,\r\nthe younger sister of Henry VIII, and he took the further precaution of\r\nmarrying her to his own son, Lord Guildford Dudley. It was in vain that\r\nthe judges and law officers of the Crown pointed out that the Act of\r\nParliament which authorised Henry to dispose of the crown by will, in the\r\ncase of his children dying without heirs, did not apply to Edward.\r\nCouncillors and judges, and even Cranmer himself, were forced to signify\r\ntheir assent by subscribing to the will, which was dated (21 June) a\r\nfortnight only before Edward's death.\r\n\r\nNorthumberland well knew the advantage to be got by securing the\r\nco-operation of the city in prosecuting his scheme, so he persuaded the\r\nmayor (Sir George Barnes), a number of aldermen (including Sir John\r\nGresham, Sir Andrew Judd, Thomas Offley and Sir Richard Dobbs), and\r\nseveral of the leading merchants of the city to append their signatures to\r\nthe will.(1362) The king had been already dead two days before\r\nNorthumberland sent for them to Greenwich and acquainted them of the fact,\r\nexhorting them at the same time to sign the document.(1363)\r\n\r\n(M700)\r\n\r\nOn the 10th July the Lady Jane was brought from Richmond and lodged in the\r\nTower, and that same evening was proclaimed queen at the Cross in Chepe.\r\nThe mayor took no part in the ceremony, and only one of the sheriffs\r\n(William Gerard or Garrard) attended the heralds. If Northumberland\r\nthought that the citizens would favour Lady Jane merely because she was a\r\nProtestant he was mistaken. The proclamation was received with undisguised\r\ncoldness, and \"few or none said God save her.\"(1364) Nor was it better\r\nreceived by the country at large. The eastern counties rose and in a few\r\ndays Mary was at the head of 30,000 men. No time was to be lost, and\r\nNorthumberland at once set out from London to meet her. As he passed\r\nthrough the city he noticed that none wished him \"God speed.\"\r\n\r\n(M701)\r\n\r\nNo sooner was his back turned than the lords of the council, seeing how\r\nmatters were going, and eager to throw off the yoke which the duke had\r\nplaced on their necks, determined upon proclaiming Mary queen. It was\r\nnecessary, however, that the City should first be informed of their\r\nintention, and that, too, without creating too much attention. One of\r\ntheir number therefore took the opportunity of the mayor riding abroad on\r\nWednesday, the 19th July, to accost him privately and bid him and the\r\nsheriffs, and such of the aldermen as he could get together at short\r\nnotice, to meet the lords of the council within an hour at the Earl of\r\nPembroke's place at Castle Baynard. The mayor hurried back, sent for the\r\nRecorder and some of the aldermen, and with them proceeded to the place\r\nappointed, where they found the council assembled. They were informed of\r\nthe intention of the lords, and the mayor was bidden to accompany them to\r\nCheapside for the purpose of proclaiming Queen Mary. Their object soon got\r\nwind; a crowd followed them to Cheapside, and when the proclamation was\r\nmade there was such a throwing up of caps and such cries of \"God save\r\nQueen Mary\" that nothing else could be heard. The civic authorities, as\r\nwell as the lords of the council, thereupon proceeded to St. Paul's to\r\nhear a _Te Deum_; after which the lords withdrew from the city, leaving\r\norders, however, for Queen Mary to be proclaimed in other parts of the\r\ncity according to custom. The next day (20 July) they returned and dined\r\nwith the mayor, sitting in council, after dinner, until four o'clock in\r\nthe afternoon, whilst the church bells rang all day long.(1365)\r\n\r\n(M702)\r\n\r\nAs soon as Northumberland heard of the turn affairs had taken, he caused\r\nMary to be proclaimed at Cambridge, where he happened to be quartered,\r\n\"castinge up his capp after as if he had bene joyfull of it.\" His\r\nsimulated enthusiasm, however, availed him nothing, and orders were issued\r\nfor his arrest. Special precautions were taken to avoid disturbance on the\r\nday (25 July) that he passed through the city on his way to the Tower,\r\nevery householder in the several wards through which he and his fellow\r\nprisoners were to pass being instructed to hold himself in readiness\r\nwithin doors with a clean halberd, and a bill or \"pollox\" for such service\r\nas the alderman might appoint.(1366) No disturbance took place, the\r\npopulace contenting itself with cursing the duke and calling him traitor,\r\nand making him take off his hat as he passed through Bishopsgate and\r\ncontinue his journey bareheaded.(1367)\r\n\r\n(M703)\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 3rd August Queen Mary made her first entry into the\r\ncity, accompanied by her sister Elizabeth. She had come from Newhall, in\r\nEssex, where a few days before she had been presented with the sum of L500\r\nin gold by a deputation of the Court of Aldermen accompanied by the\r\nRecorder.(1368) On the 2nd August it was decided that the lord mayor and\r\nhis brethren should ride out the next afternoon to meet her majesty at the\r\nBars without Aldgate, and taking their places appointed by the\r\nherald-of-arms, should accompany the royal procession.(1369) The reception\r\nwhich the new queen met with in the city must have been gratifying. The\r\nmayor, on approaching her, handed to her the civic sword, which was given\r\nto the Earl of Arundel to carry before her. The mayor himself bore the\r\nmace. By express permission of the Court of Aldermen a number of\r\nFlorentine and other merchant strangers were allowed to attend on\r\nhorseback, and to erect a pageant at Leadenhall.(1370) The whole length of\r\nthe streets through which the queen had to pass on her way to the Tower\r\nhad been lavishly decorated, and was lined with members of the various\r\ncivic companies in their livery gowns. Nothing was omitted that could\r\nplease the eye or ear.(1371)\r\n\r\nA touching scene took place as Mary was about to enter the Tower. The\r\nwidow of the Duke of Somerset, to whose policy as protector Mary had\r\noffered a steady opposition, met the queen at the Tower gate, and in\r\ncompany with the Duke of Norfolk, Stephen Gardiner and others, who had\r\nbeen confined in the Tower in the late reign, knelt down and saluted her.\r\nMary, in a charitable mood, kissed each of them, claimed them as her own\r\nprisoners, and shortly afterwards granted them their liberty.(1372)\r\n\r\n(M704)\r\n\r\nA week later (10 Aug.) the remains of the late king were carried from\r\nWhitehall to Westminster and laid in Henry the Seventh's Chapel, the\r\nservice being conducted wholly in English, the communion taking the place\r\nof the mass, and the priests being vested in a surplice only, in\r\naccordance with the provisions of the Book of Common Prayer. For a short\r\ntime after Mary's accession it was thought that she would be content if\r\nthe Church were restored to the position it was in at the time when Henry\r\nVIII died. It was not long before the new queen shewed this opinion to be\r\nerroneous. The Prayer Book of King Edward VI was set aside, the high\r\naltars that had been removed were restored, and mass was restored. Ridley\r\nwas sent to the Tower and Bonner brought out from the Marshalsea and\r\nreinstated in the bishophric of London. Gardiner, who had been deprived of\r\nhis see of Winchester and kept prisoner in the Tower, not only recovered\r\nhis freedom and his see, but was made the queen's chancellor. On the other\r\nhand, Cranmer and \"Mr. Latimer\" were sent to the Tower.\r\n\r\n(M705)\r\n\r\nThe change that was being wrought caused some little disturbance in the\r\ncity. When Doctor Bourne, who had been put up by the queen to preach at\r\nPaul's Cross one Sunday in August, began to pray for the dead, and to\r\nrefer to Bonner's late imprisonment, one of his hearers threw a knife at\r\nhim whilst others called the preacher a liar. The queen was so angry at\r\nthis that she sent for the mayor and aldermen and told them plainly that\r\nshe would deprive the city of its liberties if they could not better\r\npreserve peace and good order within its walls.(1373)\r\n\r\nA few days later she issued a proclamation in which, whilst making no\r\nsecret of her wish that everyone would conform to the religion \"which all\r\nmen knew she had of long tyme observed, and ment, God willing, to contynue\r\nthe same,\" she deprecated men calling each other heretic or papist, but\r\nwilled that everyone should follow the religion he thought best until\r\nfurther orders were taken.(1374) The mayor in the meantime had also issued\r\nhis precept against any sermon or lecture being read other than the Divine\r\nService appointed until the queen's further pleasure should be made\r\nknown.(1375)\r\n\r\nLest any disturbance should arise on the following Sunday (20 Aug.), when\r\nBishop Gardiner's chaplain was to preach at Paul's Cross, the queen sent\r\nthe captain of the guard with 200 men, who surrounded the pulpit, halberd\r\nin hand. The mayor, too, had ordered the livery companies to be present\r\n\"to herken yf any leude or sedicious persons made any rumors\"--a precaution\r\nwhich much pleased the queen.(1376)\r\n\r\n(M706)\r\n\r\nWhen Michaelmas-day (the day on which the election of the new mayor for\r\nthe ensuing year was to take place) came round, the choice of the citizens\r\nfell upon Sir Thomas White.(1377) In accordance with the new order of\r\nthings, the election was preceded by the celebration of mass in the\r\nGuildhall Chapel as of old.\r\n\r\n(M707)\r\n\r\nThe day after the election of the new mayor the queen passed through the\r\ncity from the Tower to Whitehall for her coronation. The streets presented\r\ntheir usual gay appearance on this occasion, and the queen was made the\r\nrecipient of the \"accustomed\" gift of 1,000 marks on behalf of the\r\ncity.(1378) On the day of the coronation (1 Oct.) the daily service at St.\r\nPaul's had to be suspended because all the priests not under censure for\r\nProtestantism or for having married were summoned to assist at\r\nWestminster.(1379)\r\n\r\n(M708)\r\n\r\nWhen Mary appeared before her first parliament(1380) she found her\r\nsubjects in many points opposed to her. They were willing to restore the\r\nworship and practice of the Church as they existed before the death of\r\nHenry VIII, but they showed a determination neither to submit to Rome nor\r\nto restore to the Church the property of which it had been deprived. They\r\nknew, moreover, of her anxious wish to marry Philip, son of the emperor\r\nCharles V, and yet did not hesitate to present to her a petition against a\r\nforeign marriage. It was a bold step for parliament to take in those days,\r\nand showed that it was determined to win back its ancient rights and no\r\nlonger to be the tool of the crown. Mary was not one likely to yield in a\r\nmatter on which she had once set her heart. Rather than take its advice\r\nshe dissolved parliament. The result was an insurrection.\r\n\r\n(M709)\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the aged Cranmer and the youthful Lady Jane Grey--she\r\n\"that wolde a been qwene\"--her husband and two of her husband's brothers\r\nhad been brought to trial at the Guildhall (13 Nov). The axe was borne\r\nbefore them on their way from the Tower, as if in anticipation of the\r\nverdict. The Lady Jane is described as clad in a black gown, with velvet\r\ncap and black hood, having a black velvet book hanging at her girdle,\r\nwhilst she carried another in her hand.(1381) Each of the accused pleaded\r\nguilty, and sentence of death was passed; its execution was, however,\r\ndelayed owing to the outbreak known as Wyatt's Rebellion.\r\n\r\n(M710)\r\n\r\nThe ostensible cause of the rebellion was the queen's determination at all\r\nhazards to marry Philip, whose ambassadors arrived at the opening of the\r\nnew year (1554). The civic authorities had been warned to treat them\r\nhandsomely, a warning which was scarcely necessary, for the citizens have\r\nnever allowed political differences to interfere with their hospitality;\r\nand accordingly one of the ambassadors was lodged at Durham Place, near\r\nCharing Cross, another at the Duke of Suffolk's house hard by, whilst a\r\nthird shared apartments with the chancellor \"Nigro\" (Philip Negri) in Sir\r\nRichard Sackville's house at the conduit in Fleet Street. To each and all\r\nof the guests the City sent presents of wax, torches, flour and every kind\r\nof meat, game and poultry.(1382) Formal announcement of the intended match\r\nwas made by the chancellor on the 14th January, but it was received with\r\nevery sign of discontent and misgiving, \"yea and therat allmost eche man\r\nwas abashed, loking daylie for worse mattiers to growe shortly\r\nafter.\"(1383) The following day (15 Jan.)--the day on which the rebellion\r\nunder Wyatt broke out in Kent, to be followed by risings in Devonshire and\r\nNorfolk--the mayor and aldermen were summoned to court and ordered to bring\r\nwith them forty of the chief commoners of the city, when the lord\r\nchancellor informed them of the queen's intention, and exhorted them as\r\nobedient subjects to accept her grace's pleasure and to remain content and\r\nquiet. He warned them, at the same time, to see that the queen's wishes\r\nrespecting religious services in the city were strictly carried out, on\r\npain of incurring her high indignation.(1384)\r\n\r\n(M711)\r\n\r\nSteps were taken for putting the city into a proper state of defence. The\r\ncivic companies were ordered to set watches as on similar critical\r\noccasions, and no gunpowder, weapons or other munitions of war were\r\nallowed to be sent out of the city. Chains were set up at the bridge-foot\r\nand at the corner of New Fish Street. The borough of Southwark was called\r\nupon to provide eighty tall and able men, well harnessed and weaponed, for\r\nthe safeguard of the queen's person and of the city,(1385) whilst the\r\nlivery companies at a few hours' notice furnished a force of 500 men to be\r\nspeedily despatched by water to Gravesend.(1386)\r\n\r\n(M712)\r\n\r\nWhatever faults Queen Mary had, she was by no means deficient in courage.\r\nOn the same day (1 Feb.) that Wyatt appeared with his forces at Southwark,\r\nshe came to the Guildhall(1387) and there addressed a spirited harangue to\r\nthe assembled citizens.(1388) She plainly told them that her proposed\r\nmarriage was but a Spanish cloak to cover the real purpose of the\r\nrebellion, which was aimed against her religion. She was their queen, and\r\nthey had sworn allegiance to her; they surely would not allow her to fall\r\ninto the hands of so vile a traitor as Wyatt was. As for her marriage, it\r\nhad been arranged with the full knowledge of the lords of the council, as\r\none of expediency for the realm. Passion had no part in the matter. She\r\nhad hitherto, she thanked God, lived a virgin, and doubted not she could,\r\nif necessary, live so still. At the close of her speech, which, we are\r\ntold, was delivered in a loud voice so that all might hear, she bade the\r\ncitizens to pluck up heart and not to fear the rebels any more than she\r\ndid. She then quitted the hall and went up into the aldermen's council\r\nchamber and there refreshed herself, after which she rode through\r\nBucklersbury to the Vintry, where she took barge to Westminster.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Spanish ambassadors had taken fright at Wyatt's\r\napproach and had \"sped themselves awaie by water, and that with all\r\nhast.\"(1389) Many inhabitants of the city had also deserted their fellow\r\nburgesses at this critical time, and their names were submitted to the\r\nCourt of Aldermen for subsequent enquiry.(1390) They were, according to\r\nFoxe, afraid of being entrapped by the queen and perhaps put to death.\r\n\r\n(M713)\r\n\r\nIn response to the queen's speech the citizens at once set to work to\r\nraise a force of 1,000 men for the defence of the city, the mayor and\r\naldermen each in his own ward taking a muster. So busy was everyone on\r\nCandlemas-day (2 Feb.) that the civic authorities omitted to attend the\r\nafternoon service at St. Paul's, and the mayor's serving-men waited upon\r\nhim at dinner ready harnessed.(1391) Even the lawyers at Westminster\r\n\"pleaded in harness.\"(1392)\r\n\r\n(M714) (M715)\r\n\r\nThe defensive precautions taken by the mayor and aldermen were sufficient\r\nto prevent Wyatt making good his entry into the city by Southwark and\r\nLondon Bridge. Foiled in this direction he sought to approach the city\r\nfrom another side, but had to march as far as Kingston before he could\r\ncross the Thames. Many of his followers in the meantime deserted\r\nhim.(1393) Nevertheless he continued to make his way, with but little\r\nopposition, to Ludgate, which, contrary to his expectation, he found shut\r\nin his face. He had been recognised by a tailor of Watling Street, who\r\nseeing the force approaching cried, \"I know that theys be Wyettes\r\nancienttes,\" and forthwith closed the gate.(1394) That Wyatt had\r\nsupporters in the city may be gathered from the half-hearted opposition\r\nthat he met with in Southwark, as well as from the fact that many of the\r\nsoldiers raised in the city and neighbourhood deserted to Wyatt at the\r\noutset of the rebellion.(1395) Wyatt himself exhibited no little\r\ndisappointment at finding Ludgate closed against him instead of the aid\r\nwhich he evidently had expected. \"I have kept touch\" said he, as he turned\r\nhis back on the city.(1396) He had scarcely reached Temple Bar before he\r\nwas overcome by a superior force and yielded himself a prisoner. After a\r\nshort stay at Whitehall he was removed to the Tower.\r\n\r\n(M716)\r\n\r\nThe failure of the revolt was fatal to Lady Jane Grey, and she was\r\nbeheaded within the Tower (12 Feb.) almost at the same time that her\r\nhusband was being executed outside on Tower Hill. By the strange irony of\r\nfortune, it fell to the lot of Thomas Offley to perform the duties of\r\nsheriff at Dudley's execution, although he had himself been one of the\r\nsupporters of the Lady Jane in her claim to the crown. For the next few\r\ndays the city presented a sad spectacle; whichever way one turned there\r\nwas to be seen a gibbet with its wretched burden, whilst the city's gates\r\nbristled with human heads.(1397) Wyatt himself was one of the last to\r\nsuffer, being brought to the block on Tower Hill on the 11th April. His\r\nhead and a portion of his body, after being exposed on gallows, were taken\r\naway by his friends for decent burial.(1398)\r\n\r\n(M717)\r\n\r\nOn the 17th February proclamation was made for all strangers to leave the\r\nrealm, on the ground that they sowed the seeds of their \"malycyouse\r\ndoctryne and lewde conversacioun\" among the queen's good subjects;(1399)\r\nand this had been followed in the city by precepts to each alderman to\r\ncall before him all the householders of his ward, both rich and poor, on\r\nWednesday the 7th March, at six o'clock in the morning, and strictly\r\ncharge them that they, their wives, their children and servants behave\r\nthemselves in all things and more especially in matters of religion,\r\nfollowing the example of the queen herself. All offenders were to be\r\nreported forthwith.(1400)\r\n\r\n(M718)\r\n\r\nA report having got abroad in the city that the lords of the council had\r\nendeavoured to extract a confession from Wyatt implicating the Princess\r\nElizabeth in the late rebellion, the mayor was ordered by Bishop Gardiner\r\nto bring up the originator of the rumour before the Star Chamber. When Sir\r\nThomas White appeared with the culprit, one Richard Cut by name, a servant\r\nto a grocer in the city, he was soundly rated by Gardiner for not having\r\nhimself punished the offender, and when he replied that the party was\r\nthere present for the Star Chamber to deal with according to its pleasure,\r\nwas again rebuked:--\"My lord, take heed to your charge, the Citie of London\r\nis a whirlepoole and a sinke of evill rumors, there they be bred, and from\r\nthence spred into all parts of the realme.\"(1401) Cut paid the penalty for\r\nhis love of gossip by being made to stand two days in the pillory and by\r\nthe loss of his ears.(1402)\r\n\r\n(M719)\r\n\r\nThe suppression of the revolt left Mary at liberty to carry out her\r\nmatrimonial design. But before accomplishing this she was determined to\r\nplace such a garrison in or near London as should prevent similar\r\noutbreaks in future. For this purpose she applied to the citizens for a\r\nsum of 6,000 marks. Thus called upon to supply a rod for their own backs,\r\nthe citizens demurred. They at first proposed to offer the sum of 1,000\r\nmarks, or at the most L1,000; they afterwards agreed to contribute double\r\nthe first mentioned sum,(1403) and this was accepted. The money was raised\r\nby contributions from the different livery companies, the Merchant\r\nTaylors, the Mercers, the Grocers, the Drapers, the Fishmongers, the\r\nGoldsmiths, and the Haberdashers being called upon to subscribe the sum of\r\nL100 respectively, whilst the rest of the companies paid sums varying from\r\nL80 to forty shillings.(1404) No sooner had the citizens satisfied the\r\nqueen in this respect than they were called upon to send 200 soldiers to\r\nGillingham, in Kent, there to be embarked for foreign service under the\r\nLord Admiral. The City again demurred, and asked to be excused the\r\nnecessity of forwarding the men beyond Billingsgate or the Tower Wharf and\r\nalso of providing them with accoutrements. It was to no purpose, both men\r\nand accoutrements had to be found.(1405) On the 10th April the chamberlain\r\nreceived orders to see that the city's artillery was in readiness and to\r\nincrease the store of gunpowder.(1406) Wyatt was to be executed the next\r\nday, and these orders were probably given in anticipation of a\r\ndisturbance.\r\n\r\n(M720)\r\n\r\nThat Wyatt still had friends in the city is shown by the bold attitude\r\ntaken up by the jury in the trial (17 April) of one of his accomplices,\r\nNicholas Throckmorton, against whom they brought in a verdict of not\r\nguilty.(1407) For this they were bound over to appear before the Star\r\nChamber. Four of the twelve made submission; the rest, among whom were\r\nThomas Whetstone, a haberdasher, and Emanuel Lucar, a merchant tailor,\r\nwere committed some to the Tower and the rest to the Fleet, where they\r\nremained for six months. In the meantime the Court of Aldermen wrote (19\r\nJuly) to the council in their favour, but with little success.(1408) A\r\nmonth later (19 August) a deputation waited on the Court of Aldermen for\r\nadvice as to what future steps had best be taken for obtaining the release\r\nof their brethren in the Fleet, when they were told that the wives of the\r\nprisoners or the prisoners' friends should first make suit to the council\r\nfor their release, after which the court would see what they could\r\ndo.(1409) At length the prisoners were summoned once more (26 Oct.) before\r\nthe Star Chamber, when they one and all declared that they had only acted\r\nin accordance with their conscience, whilst Lucar, more outspoken than the\r\nrest, asserted that \"they had done in the matter like honest men and true\r\nand faithful subjects.\" Such plain speaking ill suited the judges, who\r\nthereupon condemned the offenders to a fine of 1,000 marks apiece and\r\nimprisonment until further order. Eventually five out of the eight were\r\ndischarged (12 December) on payment of a fine of L220, and ten days later\r\nthe rest regained their liberty on payment of L60 apiece.(1410)\r\n\r\n(M721)\r\n\r\nA parliament which met in April (1554)(1411) gave its consent to Mary's\r\nmarriage with Philip, but refused to re-enact the old statutes for the\r\npersecution of heretics. On the 19th July Philip landed at Southampton,\r\nand on the 21st Mary herself notified the event to the citizens of\r\nLondon,(1412) who for some time past had been making preparations for\r\ngiving both queen and king a fitting reception, and who immediately on\r\nreceipt of the news of Philip's landing caused bonfires to be lighted in\r\nthe streets.(1413)\r\n\r\n(M722)\r\n\r\nMary rode down to Winchester to meet Philip,(1414) and on the 25th became\r\nhis wife. It was not until the 17th August that the royal pair approached\r\nthe city. On that day they came by water from Richmond to Southwark, the\r\nking in one barge, the queen in another. After taking refreshment at the\r\nBishop of Winchester's palace, and killing a buck or two in the bishop's\r\npark, they retired to rest.(1415) Special orders were given to the\r\naldermen to keep a good and substantial double watch in the city from nine\r\no'clock in the evening (17 Aug.) until five o'clock the next morning, such\r\nwatch to continue until further notice.(1416) The authorities differ\r\nwidely as to the precise day on which the royal party passed through the\r\ncity. The city's own records point to the afternoon of Sunday the 19th\r\nAugust as the day. On the morning of that day the Court of Aldermen sat,\r\nand a letter from the queen commending them for their forwardness in\r\n\"making shewes of honour and gladnes\" for the occasion was read to the\r\nwardens of all the companies for them to communicate to the members. The\r\nwardens were further enjoined to give strict orders to the members of\r\ntheir several companies to honestly use and entreat the Spaniards in all\r\nthings, both at their coming in with the king and queen and ever\r\nafterwards. The same morning a speech which the Recorder had prepared for\r\nthe occasion in English was handed over to the master of St. Paul's School\r\nto be turned into Latin. None too much time was allowed the worthy\r\npedagogue for the purpose, for he was to give it back that same afternoon\r\nso that the Recorder might \"make and pronounce yt to the kinges majesty at\r\nhis comynge in.\"(1417)\r\n\r\nA curious incident is related in connection with the royal procession\r\nthrough the city. The conduit in Gracious Church Street, which had been\r\nnewly painted and gilded, bore representations of the \"nine worthies,\" and\r\namong them Henry the Eighth and Edward the Sixth. Instead of carrying a\r\nsword or mace like the rest, Henry had been portrayed with a sceptre in\r\none hand and a book bearing the inscription _Verbum Dei_ in the other.\r\nThis catching the eye of Bishop Gardiner as he passed in the royal train,\r\nhe was very wroth and sent for the painter, asked him by whose orders he\r\nhad so depicted the king, called him \"traitor\" and threatened him with the\r\nFleet prison. The poor painter, who for the first time had been made to\r\nrealise the change that was taking place, pleaded that what he had done\r\nhad been done in all innocence, and hastened to rectify his mistake by\r\nremoving the bible from the picture and substituting in its place a pair\r\nof gloves.(1418)\r\n\r\n(M723)\r\n\r\nIn November (1554) a new parliament(1419) was called, which proved more\r\nready than the last to comply with the queen's wishes. It re-enacted the\r\nstatutes for burning heretics and agreed to a reconciliation of the Church\r\nof England with the See of Rome, but it refused to sanction the surrender\r\nof Church lands. Bonner had already taken steps to purge his diocese of\r\nheresy by issuing a series of articles (14 Sept.) to which every\r\ninhabitant, clerical and lay, was expected to conform.(1420) That there\r\nwas room for improvement in matters touching religion and public decorum\r\nthere is no doubt, otherwise there would have been no need of\r\nproclamations such as those against the arrest of persons whilst\r\nconducting service in church,(1421) against wrangling over passages of\r\nscripture in common taverns and victualling houses,(1422) or against\r\ncarrying of baskets of provisions and leading mules, horses or other\r\nbeasts through St. Paul's.(1423)\r\n\r\nThe mayor and aldermen endeavoured to set a good example by constant\r\nattendance at the services and by joining in processions at St. Paul's as\r\nin former days.(1424) The law forbidding the eating of meat in Lent,\r\nexcept by special licence, was vigorously enforced.(1425) Ale-houses and\r\ntaverns were closed on Sundays and holy days, and interludes were\r\nforbidden.(1426)\r\n\r\n(M724)\r\n\r\nNevertheless the attempt to restore the old worship within the city was\r\noften met with scornful mockery, sometimes attended with violence. A dead\r\ncat, for instance, was one day found hanging in Cheapside, its head shorn\r\nin imitation of a priest's tonsure, and its body clothed in a mock\r\necclesiastical vestment, with cross before and behind, whilst a piece of\r\nwhite paper to represent a singing-cake was placed between its forefeet,\r\nwhich had been tied together. Bonner was very angry at this travesty of\r\nreligion, and caused the effigy to be publicly displayed at Paul's Cross\r\nduring sermon time. A reward of twenty marks was offered for the discovery\r\nof this atrocious act, but with what success we do not know.(1427)\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, when the Holy Sacrament was being carried in solemn\r\nprocession through Smithfield on Corpus Christi-day (24 May), an attempt\r\nwas made to knock the holy elements out of the hands of the priest. The\r\noffender was taken to Newgate, where he feigned to be mad.(1428) Again, on\r\nthe following Easter-day a priest was fiercely attacked by a man with a\r\nwood-knife whilst administering the sacrament in the church of St.\r\nMargaret, Westminster. The culprit was seized, and after trial and\r\nconviction paid the penalty of his crime by being burned at the\r\nstake.(1429) A pudding was once offered to a priest whilst walking in a\r\nreligious procession,(1430) the offender being afterwards whipt at the\r\n\"Post of Reformation,\" which had been set up in Cheapside in 1553.(1431)\r\nBut all this defiance shown to Mary's attempt to restore the old worship\r\nonly led her to exercise more drastic methods for accomplishing her\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n(M725)\r\n\r\nBy the opening of 1555 her own strong personal will had overcome the\r\nconciliatory policy of her husband, who was content to restrain his\r\nfanaticism within the limits of expediency, and the Marian persecution\r\ncommenced. On the 25th January a proclamation was issued in the name of\r\nthe king and queen, and bearing the signature of William Blackwell, the\r\ntown clerk of the city, enjoining the lighting of bonfires that afternoon\r\nin various places in token of great joy and gladness for the abolition of\r\nsundry great sins, errors and heresies which lately had arisen within the\r\nrealm of England, and for the quiet renovation and restitution of the true\r\nCatholic faith of Christ and his holy religion.(1432) This proclamation\r\nwas but a prelude to other fires lighted for a very different purpose,\r\nwhich the mind even at this day cannot contemplate without a shudder. The\r\nfirst victim of the flames for conscience sake was John Rogers, once vicar\r\nof St. Sepulchre's church and prebendary of St. Paul's. He was burnt in\r\nSmithfield \"for gret herysy\" in February of this year, in which month\r\nHooper, who had been deprived of his bishopric of Gloucester, suffered the\r\nsame fate in his own cathedral city.(1433) In the following May another\r\ncity vicar, John Cardmaker, otherwise known as John Taylor of St. Bride's,\r\nwho had been a reader at St. Paul's and had publicly lectured against the\r\nreal presence, was burnt in Smithfield with John Warne, an \"upholder\" of\r\nWalbrook.(1434)\r\n\r\nFew weeks passed without the fire claiming some human victim either in\r\nLondon or the provinces. On the 9th February Thomas Tomkins, a godly and\r\ncharitable weaver of Shoreditch, and William Hunter, a young London\r\napprentice, were with four others condemned to the stake. The two named\r\nmet their fate in Smithfield, one on the 16th March and the other on the\r\n26th. The rest were removed into Essex and there consigned to the flames,\r\nthree of them in March and one in the following June.(1435)\r\n\r\nIn October Bishops Latimer and Ridley were burnt at Oxford. \"Be of good\r\ncomfort, Master Ridley, and play the man\"--cried Latimer encouragingly to\r\nhis fellow sufferer--\"we shall this day light such a candle, by God's\r\ngrace, in England as I trust shall never be put out.\" In March of the\r\nfollowing year (1556) Cranmer, after some display of weakness, suffered\r\nthe same fate, on the same spot, and with no less fortitude. And thus for\r\ntwo years more the fires were kept alive in London and in the country; the\r\nLollard's tower at St. Paul's serving as a prison for heretics,(1436) and\r\nproving more often than not but a step to Smithfield.\r\n\r\n(M726)\r\n\r\nThroughout Mary's reign the strife between the citizens and merchant\r\nstrangers was renewed. She had herself added to the evil by her marriage\r\nwith Philip, causing the city to be flooded with Spaniards, who took up\r\ntheir abode in the halls of the civic companies.(1437) A rumour got abroad\r\nearly in September, 1554, that 12,000 Spaniards were coming over \"to fethe\r\nthe crown,\"(1438) and this accounts for precepts being sent to the several\r\naldermen of the city on the 27th September enjoining them to make a return\r\nof the number of foreigners that had come to reside in their ward during\r\nthe past nine or ten days, and whence they came.(1439) The favour shown by\r\nthe Crown to the merchants of the Steelyard was especially annoying to the\r\nfreemen of the city.(1440) It was to little purpose that the mayor and\r\naldermen issued orders from time to time against giving work to foreigners\r\nand prohibiting all such from opening shops within the city.(1441) The\r\nstruggle between citizen and stranger still went on. In 1557 the\r\ncorporation made an effort to induce the king and queen to revoke the\r\nfavours shown to the merchants of the Steelyard in prejudice of the\r\nliberties of the city,(1442) and eventually the privileges were revoked on\r\nthe ground that the merchants of the Hanse had not kept faith with the\r\nCrown.(1443) In the same year the exclusiveness entertained by the\r\ncitizens towards foreigners made itself felt more particularly against\r\nthat class of foreigner which kept open school in the city for teaching\r\nwriting. Certain scriveners, freemen of the city, made a complaint before\r\nthe Court of Aldermen against foreigners keeping writing-school within the\r\ncity and its liberties.(1444) The chamberlain's conduct of shutting in the\r\nshop windows of foreigners teaching children to write was approved by the\r\nmayor and aldermen,(1445) whilst freemen were allowed to keep open school\r\nprovided they entered into a bond not to engross deeds.(1446) Occasionally\r\nforeigners were successful in obtaining licences from the civic\r\nauthorities for teaching writing, but it was only on condition they kept\r\ntheir lower windows closed.(1447)\r\n\r\n(M727) (M728) (M729)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the disposition of the queen towards heretics became more\r\nrelentless in proportion as her temper became more soured from ill-health,\r\nby disappointment in not having off-spring, and by the increasing neglect\r\nof her by her husband. Tired of her importunate love and jealousy, Philip\r\ntook the first opportunity of quitting her side and crossed over to the\r\ncontinent (4 Sept., 1555) on a visit to the Emperor Charles. The\r\nabdication of the latter towards the close of 1556 made Philip master of\r\nthe richest and most extensive dominions in Europe, and his greatest wish\r\nat the time was to engage England in the war which was kindled between\r\nSpain and France. In this he received the support of Mary, who had in\r\nAugust (1556) succeeded in obtaining a loan from the city of L6,000.(1448)\r\nThe seizure of the castle of Scarborough by Thomas Stafford,(1449) second\r\nson of Lord Stafford, in which he was reported to have received\r\nencouragement from the King of France, was made a _casus belli_, and Henry\r\nwas proclaimed an open enemy (7 June, 1557).(1450) French subjects were\r\nallowed forty days to quit the country, and letters of marque were issued\r\nby proclamation on the 9th June.(1451) On the 5th July Philip once more\r\nleft England for Flanders,(1452) having succeeded in the object for which\r\nhe had come, viz., the declaration of war against France.\r\n\r\n(M730)\r\n\r\nThe citizens of London at once began to take stock of their munitions of\r\nwar. On the 22nd June the Chamberlain was instructed to prepare with all\r\nconvenient speed four dozen good _splentes_ and as many good _sallettes_\r\nor _sculles_ for the city's use, and to cause a bowyer to \"peruse\" the\r\ncity's bows and to put them in such good order that they might be\r\nserviceable when required.(1453) In the following month a large force\r\ncrossed over to France under the leadership of Lords Pembroke, Montagu and\r\nClinton. To this force the City of London contributed a contingent of 500\r\nmen, the best (according to Machyn(1454)) that had ever been sent. They\r\nmustered at the Leadenhall on the 16th July in the presence of Sir Thomas\r\nOffley,(1455) the mayor, the sheriffs and Sir Richard Lee, and were\r\nconveyed thence by water to Gravesend and Rochester under the charge of\r\nten officers, whose names are duly recorded.(1456)\r\n\r\n(M731)\r\n\r\nOn the last day of July the queen informed the civic authorities by letter\r\nof the departure of her \"deerest lord and husband\" to pursue the enemy in\r\nFrance, and desired them to get in readiness 1,000 men, a portion of whom\r\nwere to be horsemen, well horsed and armed, and the rest to be archers,\r\npikes and billmen. The force was to be ready by the 16th August at the\r\nlatest, after which date it was to be prepared to set out at a day's\r\nnotice. The letter contained a schedule of names of individuals to whom\r\nthe queen had made special application, and these were not to be called\r\nupon by the municipal officers to make any contribution, neither were the\r\ntenants of those noblemen and gentlemen already on active service in\r\nFrance.(1457)\r\n\r\n(M732)\r\n\r\nThe Court of Aldermen was taken aback at such a demand coming so soon\r\nafter the setting out of the previous force, and on the 4th August it\r\ninstructed the Recorder and one of the sheriffs to repair to the queen's\r\ncouncil \"for the good and suer understandyng of her majesty's pleasure\" in\r\nthe matter. The deputation was further instructed to remind the lords of\r\nthe council not only of the ancient liberties and franchises of the city\r\non the point, but also of the city's lack of power to furnish a number of\r\nmen exceeding any it had ever been called upon to furnish before.(1458) It\r\nwas all to no purpose; the men had to be provided; and the matter having\r\nbeen fully explained to the wardens of the several livery companies, they\r\nsucceeded in raising the force required.(1459)\r\n\r\n(M733)\r\n\r\nThe defeat of the French king at St. Quentin was celebrated in the city by\r\na solemn procession to St. Paul's, in which figured the mayor and aldermen\r\nin their scarlet gowns.(1460) The joy of the citizens was shortlived.\r\nPhilip's caution did not allow him to avail himself of the opportunity\r\nthus offered him of marching on the French capital, and before the end of\r\nthe year matters had taken a different turn.\r\n\r\n(M734) (M735)\r\n\r\nIn December a Spaniard named Ferdinando Lygons was commissioned to raise\r\n300 mounted archers in the city of London and county of Middlesex.(1461)\r\nAt the opening of the new year (2 Jan., 1558) the queen wrote to the\r\ncorporation desiring to be at once furnished with 500 men out of the 1,000\r\nmen the city had been ordered to keep in readiness since July. As the\r\nmatter was urgent they were not to wait to supply the men with\r\ncoats.(1462) The force was required for the defence of Calais, which was\r\nnow in a critical position. On the 9th January another letter was sent by\r\nMary marked, _Hast, Hast Post, Hast, For lief, For lief, For lief, For\r\nlief!_ demanding the full contingent of 1,000 men.(1463) Calais had fallen\r\ntwo days before,(1464) and Mary was determined not to rest until the town\r\nhad been recovered. Diligent search was at once instituted throughout the\r\ncity for all persons, strangers as well as freemen, capable of wearing\r\nharness;(1465) and the livery companies and fellowships were called upon\r\nto provide double the number of men they had furnished in July last.(1466)\r\nOn the 13th the queen wrote to say that a violent storm, which had\r\noccurred on the night of the 10th January, had so crippled the fleet that\r\nher forces could not be conveyed across the channel; the civic authorities\r\nwere therefore to withhold sending their force to the sea-coast until\r\nfurther orders, but to keep the same in readiness to start at an hour's\r\nnotice.(1467) On the 19th January the citizens were informed by letter\r\nthat Philip's forces were on their way to Flanders, under the Duke of\r\nSavoy, and that the channel was being kept open by a fleet under Don Luis\r\nCarvaial. One half of the force of 1,000 men, furnished with armour and\r\nweapons and coats of white welted with green and red crosses, was to be\r\ndespatched to Dover by the end of the month, thence to sail for Dunkirk\r\nfor service under the Earl of Rutland. The City was to take especial care\r\nthat the contingent should be chosen from the handsomest and best picked\r\nmen, and superior to those last sent.(1468) The force mustered at the\r\nLeadenhall, the 24th January, for inspection by the mayor, and at five\r\no'clock in the evening were delivered over to the captains for\r\nshipment.(1469) Three days later the lords of the council instructed the\r\nmayor to make a return of the number of foreigners residing still within\r\nthe city, and to make proclamation on the next market day that it should\r\nbe lawful thenceforth for anyone to seize the persons of Frenchmen who had\r\nnot avoided the city pursuant to a previous order, and to confiscate their\r\ngoods and chattels to his own proper use.(1470)\r\n\r\n(M736)\r\n\r\nMary succeeded in March in raising a loan in the city of L20,000 (she had\r\nasked for 100,000 marks or L75,000(1471)) on the security of the crown\r\nlands. The loan bore interest at the rate of twelve per cent., and a\r\nspecial dispensation was granted to avoid the penalties of the Usury\r\nAct.(1472) The money was raised by assessment on the livery companies. On\r\nthe 16th March the Court of Aldermen summoned the wardens of the twelve\r\nprincipal companies to attend at the Guildhall at eight o'clock the next\r\nmorning, in order that they might learn how much the lords of the council\r\nhad \"*tottyd*\" against each of them towards the loan. The smaller\r\ncompanies were to attend in the afternoon of the same day in order to be\r\ninformed of the sums the Court of Aldermen deemed fit that each should\r\ncontribute to assist their wealthier brethren. The total amount subscribed\r\nby the greater companies was L16,983 _6s._ 8_d._, of which the Mercers\r\ncontributed L3,275. The lesser companies subscribed L1,310, in sums\r\nvarying from L30 to L500.(1473)\r\n\r\n(M737)\r\n\r\nIt is probable that Mary wanted this loan to enable her to prosecute the\r\nwar. The country was not disposed, however, to assist her in this\r\ndirection. The people were afraid of rendering Philip too powerful.\r\nDisappointed both in her public and domestic life, she fell a victim to\r\ndropsy and died on the 17th November--\"wondering why all that she had done,\r\nas she believed on God's behalf, had been followed by failure on every\r\nside--by the desertion of her husband, and the hatred of her subjects.\" The\r\nloss of Calais so much affected her that she declared that the name of the\r\ntown would be found impressed upon her heart after death. On the occasion\r\nof her funeral the City put in its customary claim for black livery cloth,\r\nbut more than one application had to be made before the cloth was\r\nforthcoming.(1474)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(M738)\r\n\r\nThe accession of Elizabeth, after the gloomy reign of her sister, was\r\nwelcomed by none more joyfully than by the citizens of London, who\r\ncontinued to commemorate the day with bonfires and general rejoicing long\r\nafter the queen had been laid in her grave.(1475) When news was brought of\r\nher sister's death Elizabeth was at Hatfield. Within a week she removed to\r\nLondon and took up her abode at the Charterhouse. The sheriffs went out to\r\nmeet her as far as the boundary of the county of Middlesex, the limit of\r\ntheir jurisdiction, dressed in coats of velvet, with their chains about\r\ntheir necks and white rods in their hands. Having first kissed their rods,\r\nthey handed them to the queen, who immediately returned them, and the\r\nsheriffs thereupon joined the gentlemen of the cavalcade and rode before\r\nher majesty until they met Sir Thomas Leigh,(1476) the mayor, and his\r\nbrethren the aldermen. The sheriffs then fell back and took their places\r\namong the aldermen.(1477) From the Charterhouse she removed after a stay\r\nof a few days to the Tower, amid the blare of trumpets, the singing of\r\nchildren and the firing of ordnance.\r\n\r\n(M739)\r\n\r\nThe Court of Common Council (21 Nov.) agreed to levy two fifteenths on the\r\ninhabitants of the city for the customary present to be given the new\r\nqueen on her passing through the city to her coronation, which was to take\r\nplace on the 15th January following, as well as for defraying the costs of\r\npageants on the occasion.(1478) Committees were appointed to see that the\r\nseveral conduits, the Standard and Cross in Cheap, and other parts of the\r\ncity were seemly trimmed and decked with pageants, fine paintings and rich\r\ncloth of Arras, silver and gold, as at the coronation of Queen Mary, and\r\nbetter still if it conveniently could be done.(1479) Among those appointed\r\nto devise pageants for the occasion and to act as masters of the ceremony\r\nwas Richard Grafton, the printer.(1480) Eight commoners were appointed by\r\nthe Court of Aldermen (17 Dec.) to attend upon the chief butler of England\r\nat the cupboard at the coronation banquet.(1481)\r\n\r\n(M740)\r\n\r\nA curious instance of a strike among painters is recorded at this time.\r\nThe painters of the city, we are told, utterly refused to fresh paint and\r\ntrim the great conduit in Cheap for the coronation for the sum of twenty\r\nmarks. This being the case, the surveyors of the city were instructed to\r\ncause the same to be covered with cloth of Arras having escutcheons of the\r\nqueen's Arms finely made and set therein, and the wardens of the Painters'\r\nCompany were called upon to render assistance with advice and men for\r\nreasonable remuneration.(1482)\r\n\r\n(M741)\r\n\r\nThe main object which Elizabeth kept before her eyes, from first to last,\r\nwas the preservation of peace--peace within the Church and without. Her\r\nnatural inclination was towards the more ornate ritual of the Roman\r\nChurch, but the necessity she was under of gaining the support of the\r\nProtestants, whom even the fires of Smithfield had failed to suppress,\r\ninspired restraint. All her actions were marked with caution and\r\ndeliberation. From the day of her accession religious persecution in its\r\nworst form ceased. Non-conformity was no longer punished by death.\r\nPreachers who took advantage of the lull which followed the Marian\r\npersecution and resumed disputatious sermons, as they did more especially\r\nin the city, were silenced by royal proclamation,(1483) which ordered them\r\nto confine themselves to reading the gospel and epistle for the day, and\r\nthe Ten Commandments, in the vulgar tongue, without adding any comment.\r\nThey were further ordered to make use of no public prayer, rite or\r\nceremony other than that already accepted until parliament should ordain\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\n(M742)\r\n\r\nParliament met in January, 1559, and at once acknowledged the queen's\r\nlegitimacy and her title to the crown, an acknowledgment which she had\r\nfailed to obtain from the Pope. An Act of Uniformity was passed forbidding\r\nthe use of any form of public prayer other than that set out in the last\r\nPrayer Book of Edward VI, amended in those particulars which savoured of\r\nultra-Protestantism. The same parliament also passed an Act of Supremacy,\r\nwhich dropt the title of supreme head of the Church with reference to the\r\nqueen, but still upheld the ancient jurisdiction of the Crown over all\r\necclesiastics. Having accomplished this much, parliament was dissolved (8\r\nMay).\r\n\r\n(M743)\r\n\r\nOn the following Whitsunday (14 May) Divine Service was conducted in the\r\ncity in English according to the Book of Common Prayer.(1484)\r\nCommissioners were appointed in July \"to ride about the realm for the\r\nestablishing of true religion,\" four being nominated for the city, whose\r\nduty it was to call before them divers persons of every parish and make\r\nthem swear to observe \"certain injunctions newly set out in print.\"(1485)\r\nThe election of a new mayor at Michaelmas was followed by the celebration\r\nof a \"communion\" in the Guildhall Chapel.\"(1486)\r\n\r\n(M744)\r\n\r\nThe success of Elizabeth's policy was unfortunately marred by the excess\r\nof zeal displayed by the reformers. More especially was this the case in\r\nthe city of London. Had the inhabitants bent their energy towards putting\r\ndown the disgraceful trafficking that went on within the very walls of\r\ntheir cathedral church, shutting up gambling houses, and stopping\r\ninterludes and plays which made a jest of religion, instead of leaving\r\nsuch abuses to be corrected by royal proclamation,(1487) their conduct\r\nwould have met with universal approbation. Instead of this they again set\r\nto work pulling down roods, smashing up ancient tombs and committing to\r\nthe flames vestments and service books--the work of years of artistic\r\nlabour(1488)--until the wanton destruction was restricted, if not\r\naltogether stopped, by the queen's orders.(1489)\r\n\r\n(M745)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the state of affairs with France and Scotland demanded\r\nElizabeth's attention. The marriage of Mary Stuart with the Dauphin of\r\nFrance had taken place in April, 1558, and the sudden death of Henry II of\r\nFrance by an accident at a tournament had soon afterwards raised her and\r\nher husband to the throne. Mary now assumed the arms and style of Queen of\r\nEngland, and the life-long quarrel between her and Elizabeth was about to\r\ncommence. By the end of the year (1559) Mary had collected a sufficient\r\nforce at her back to render her mistress of Scotland. In the following\r\nJanuary a French fleet was ready to set sail. Nevertheless Elizabeth\r\nrefused to take any active measures to meet the enemy and to prevent them\r\neffecting a landing. On the 6th she caused proclamation to be made for\r\nFrench subjects to be allowed perfect freedom as in time of peace, but\r\nEnglish vessels were to be held in readiness \"untill yt maye appeare to\r\nwhat ende the greate preparaciouns of Fraunce do entende.\"(1490) Long\r\nafter the appearance of a French fleet off the coast of Scotland, and when\r\nit had been driven to take refuge in Leith harbour, Elizabeth still\r\ndeclared her intention of keeping, if possible, on friendly terms with\r\nFrance if only the \"insolent titles and claims\" of Francis and Mary might\r\ncease and Scotland left in peace.(1491) With the aid of soldiers and\r\nseamen provided by the City(1492) the French were forced to surrender,\r\nand, by a treaty signed at Edinburgh, agreed to leave Scotland and to\r\nacknowledge Elizabeth's right to the English crown.\r\n\r\n(M746)\r\n\r\nIn 1561 Mary, who had declined to recognise the treaty of Edinburgh from\r\nthe first, returned to Scotland, in spite of Elizabeth's prohibition, and\r\nsoon succeeded in drawing over many Protestants to her side. In the\r\nfollowing year an opportunity offered itself to Elizabeth for striking a\r\nblow at her rival--not in Scotland, but in France. A civil war had broken\r\nout between the French Protestants--or Huguenots, as they were called--and\r\ntheir Catholic fellow-subjects, and Elizabeth promised (Sept., 1562) to\r\nassist the leaders of the Huguenots on condition that Havre--or Newhaven,\r\nas the place was then known--was surrendered to her as security for the\r\nfulfilment of a promise to surrender Calais. The queen (23 July, 1562)\r\napplied by letter to the City of London for a force of 600 men to be held\r\nin readiness to march at a moment's notice. She had determined, the letter\r\nsaid, to put the sea coast into a \"fencible arraye of warre.\"(1493) The\r\nmen were ordered to muster at the Leadenhall on the 18th September.(1494)\r\nThe aim and object of the expedition was set out in a \"boke\" or\r\nproclamation.(1495)\r\n\r\n(M747)\r\n\r\nIn 1563 a peace was patched up, and the Catholics and Huguenots united in\r\ndemanding from Elizabeth the restoration of Havre. The queen refused to\r\nsurrender the town, and again called upon the City of London to furnish\r\nher with 1,000 men for the purpose of enabling her to secure Havre, and to\r\ncompel the French to surrender Calais as promised.(1496) The Court of\r\nAldermen hesitated to raise so large a force, and sent a deputation of\r\nthree of their court to wait upon the lords of the Privy Council the same\r\nafternoon, with a view to having the number reduced to 500 on the ground\r\nthat the City had supplied so many soldiers during the past year.(1497)\r\nThe deputation having reported to the court the next day (3 July) that the\r\nPrivy Council would make no abatement in the number of soldiers to be\r\nfurnished, it was agreed to renew the application.(1498) Again the City's\r\nrequest was refused, and the full number of 1,000 men was apportioned\r\namong the livery companies.(1499) The citizens, jealous as they always\r\nwere of the stranger within their gates, availed themselves of a too\r\nliteral interpretation of a royal proclamation and seized all the\r\nFrenchmen they could find in the city with all their belongings. They even\r\nwent so far as to attack the house of the French ambassador, and would\r\nprobably have gone yet further lengths had they not been stopt by\r\nperemptory orders from the queen.(1500)\r\n\r\nOn the 8th July the City was informed by letter from the queen that the\r\nFrench had already commenced the siege of Havre, and was asked to have 400\r\nout of the 1,000 men ready to set sail with Lord Clinton by the\r\n16th.(1501) This letter was immediately followed by another from Lord\r\nClinton summoning every inhabitant of the city \"usinge the exercise of eny\r\nkynde of water crafte\" before the lord high admiral or his deputy at\r\nDeptford on a certain day.(1502) The Common Hunt, the city's\r\nwater-bailiffs, two sergeants-at-mace and two sheriff's officers were\r\nappointed by the Court of Aldermen to \"conduct\" the city's contingent to\r\nthe fleet lying in the Thames.(1503)\r\n\r\n(M748)\r\n\r\nBefore the end of July Havre was lost.(1504) The garrison had been\r\nattacked by a plague, which for more than a twelvemonth had been rampant\r\nin London,(1505) and the Earl of Warwick, the commander of the town, found\r\nhimself compelled to accept such terms as he could obtain. The garrison\r\nwas allowed to leave with all munitions of war. Whilst proclaiming to her\r\nsubjects the surrender of the town--not through any cowardice on the part\r\nof the garrison, but owing to a \"plage of infectuous mortall sickness\"\r\ninflicted by the Almighty--Elizabeth pleaded for tender care and charity to\r\nbe shown to the soldiers on their return, due precaution being taken by\r\nthe principal officers of every city, town and parish against the spread\r\nof infection.(1506)\r\n\r\n(M749)\r\n\r\nThe approaching end of the war with France is foreshadowed by an order of\r\nthe Court of Aldermen (25 Nov., 1563) touching the re-delivery to the\r\nvarious civic companies of the \"harness\" which they severally provided for\r\nthe war, and which had been forwarded from Portsmouth and was lying in the\r\nGuildhall Chapel.(1507) Peace was signed on the 13th April, 1564, and on\r\nthe 31st July a proclamation was issued for disbanding the navy.(1508)\r\nThroughout the war Elizabeth had been careful to keep on good terms with\r\nSpain, and English vessels found molesting Spanish ships under pretext of\r\nsearching for French goods were ordered to be arrested.(1509) An\r\ninterruption of commerce with Flanders had been threatened, owing to the\r\nDuchess of Parma having forbidden the importation of English woollen cloth\r\ninto the Low Countries for fear of infection from the plague, but\r\nElizabeth retaliated by closing English ports to all Flemish vessels, and\r\nmatters were accommodated.(1510)\r\n\r\n(M750)\r\n\r\nThe period of peace and tranquillity which ensued enabled the citizens to\r\nbestow more attention on their own affairs. Their cathedral stood in\r\nurgent need of repairs. Its steeple had been struck by lightning in 1561,\r\nand 3,000 marks had already been expended on its restoration.(1511) An\r\napplication to the City from the lord treasurer in 1565 for a sum of L300\r\ntowards roofing one of the aisles of the cathedral came as a surprise to\r\nthe Court of Aldermen, who caused enquiries to be made as to the receipt\r\nand delivery of contributions already made, and returned for answer that\r\nthe City of London had long ago delivered \"all such mony as the sayd cyty\r\ndyd at eny tyme grant or agree to geve or paye towards the sayd work.\" His\r\nlordship was desired \"no further to charge or burden the sayd cytye wth\r\nthe payment of any more mony towards the sayd work.\"(1512) Nevertheless\r\nthe City was called upon for a further contribution two years later (June,\r\n1567), when negotiations were entered into between the City, the Bishop of\r\nLondon and the Dean and Chapter of Saint Paul's, which ended in the\r\nCorporation agreeing to find forty foders of lead for roofing the south\r\naisle of the cathedral, and lending a sum of L150 to the bishop and the\r\ndean and chapter, on condition the latter granted a further lease to the\r\nCity of the manor of Finsbury for a term of 200 years beyond the term yet\r\nunexpired.(1513) Whilst repairs were being carried out in the cathedral\r\nitself, something was also being done outside the building to render the\r\naccommodation for hearing the sermons preached at Paul's Cross more\r\nconvenient for the mayor and aldermen and municipal officers. A gutter\r\nwhich conducted rainwater upon the heads of the lord mayor's suite at\r\nsermon time was removed; the bench on which the civic officials sat was\r\nenlarged for their better convenience, and places erected for the\r\naccommodation of aldermen's wives.(1514)\r\n\r\n(M751)\r\n\r\nThe rapid increase of commerce under the fostering care of Elizabeth\r\nrendered the erection of a Burse or Exchange for the accommodation of\r\nmerchants \"to treate of their feate of merchandyzes\" a pressing necessity.\r\nThe matter had been mooted thirty years before, but little had been done\r\nbeyond ascertaining the opinion of merchants as to the most convenient\r\nsite.(1515) The project, however, took root in the mind of Sir Richard\r\nGresham, an alderman of the city, whose business had occasionally carried\r\nhim to Antwerp, where he became familiar with the Burse that had been\r\nrecently set up there, and in 1537 (the year that he was elected mayor) he\r\nforwarded to Thomas Cromwell, then lord privy seal, a design for a similar\r\nBurse to be erected in London. Finding little or no attention paid to his\r\ncommunication he again (25 July, 1538) wrote to Cromwell suggesting the\r\nerection of a Burse in Lombard Street--the site favoured by city\r\nmerchants--at a cost of L2,000. If the lord privy seal would but bring\r\npressure to bear upon Sir George Monoux, a brother alderman but a man of\r\n\"noe gentyll nature,\" to part with certain property at cost price, he\r\n(Gresham) would undertake to raise L1,000 towards the building before he\r\nwent out of office, and he would himself carry Cromwell's letter to Monoux\r\nand \"handle him\" as best he could.(1516) This application had the desired\r\neffect. On the 13th August Henry VIII addressed a letter to Monoux\r\ndesiring him to dispose of certain tenements about Lombard Street which\r\nwere required for the commonweal of merchants of the city, and to come to\r\nterms with Gresham as to the amount to be paid for them. Both parties\r\nhaving referred the matter to Sir Richard Rich, Chancellor of the Court of\r\nAugmentations of the Crown, as arbitrator, the City agreed to pay a yearly\r\nsum of twenty marks for the houses that were required. Monoux refusing to\r\naccept this sum, another letter was despatched to him from the king urging\r\nhim not to stand in the way of a project so useful to merchants and\r\ntending so much to the \"beautifitye\" of the city. To this second appeal\r\nMonoux gave way, and received the cordial thanks of Henry by letter dated\r\nthe 25th November.(1517) Nothing more was done in the matter until it was\r\ntaken up many years later by Sir Thomas Gresham, son of Sir Richard.(1518)\r\nActing, as he did for a long succession of years, as Queen Elizabeth's\r\nagent in Flanders, Sir Thomas spent much of his time in Antwerp.(1519)\r\nWhen he was not there himself he employed a factor in the person of\r\nRichard Clough to conduct his affairs. In 1561 this Richard Clough, in a\r\nletter addressed to his principal from Antwerp (31 Dec.),(1520) expressed\r\nmuch astonishment at the City of London being so far behind continental\r\ntowns:--\"Consideryng what a sittey London ys, and that in so many yeres\r\nthey have nott founde the menes to make a bourse! but must walke in the\r\nraine, when ytt raineth, more lyker pedlers then marchants; and in thys\r\ncountrie, and all other, there is no kynde of pepell that have occasion to\r\nmeete, butt they have a plase meete for that pourpose.\" Indeed, Clough got\r\nquite excited over the thought that London, of all cities in the world,\r\npossessed no decent accommodation for merchants transacting their everyday\r\nbusiness, and declared his readiness to build \"so fere a bourse in London\r\nas the grett bourse is in Andwarpe\" and that \"withhoutt molestyng of any\r\nman more than he shulld be well dysposyd to geve.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not long before Gresham made up his mind that London should have a\r\nBurse, and in May, 1563, the Court of Aldermen deputed Lionel Duckett, who\r\nwas also a mercer, to sound Gresham as to \"his benevolence towards the\r\nmakyng of a burse.\"(1521) But however desirous Gresham might be to\r\nprosecute the work, he was prevented from doing so by stress of business.\r\nCommercial difficulties arose between England and the Low Countries owing\r\nto the proclamation of the Duchess of Parma. Up to the year 1564 Gresham\r\nwas forced to make Antwerp his place of abode, and could only occasionally\r\nvisit London; since that time, however, his business allowed him to look\r\nupon London as his permanent residence, and he only crossed over to\r\nAntwerp when special circumstances rendered it necessary. An additional\r\nreason for the delay in carrying out Gresham's project may perhaps be\r\nfound in the fact that, during his absence on the queen's business in\r\n1563, Elizabeth had, with her usual parsimony, cut down Gresham's\r\nallowance of twenty shillings a day for \"his diets.\" Gresham complained\r\nbitterly of this abridgment of his income in a letter to Secretary Cecil,\r\nand also in another letter couched in more guarded terms to the queen\r\nherself.(1522) In both letters he set out the sum total of the money\r\n(L830,000) which he had negotiated for the queen, and referred to his\r\nhaving broken a leg in her majesty's service and to his declining years.\r\nWhatever may have been the cause of the delay, it was not until the 4th\r\nJanuary, 1565, that a definite offer was made by Gresham to erect a\r\n\"comely burse\" at his own cost and charge, provided the City would furnish\r\na suitable site. This offer was accepted.(1523)\r\n\r\n(M752)\r\n\r\nDifficulties at once presented themselves in finding a site. It was\r\noriginally proposed to obtain from the Merchant Taylors' Company a plot of\r\nland between Lombard Street and Cornhill, but the company refused to part\r\nwith the property and a new site had to be chosen.(1524) No sooner was\r\nthis done, and a place selected to the north of Cornhill, than a\r\ndifficulty arose between the City and the Dean and Chapter of Canterbury\r\nas to the terms of purchase.(1525) This having been successfully overcome\r\nand the site purchased, the next step was to invite subscriptions, not\r\nonly from members of the livery companies, but from merchant adventurers\r\nbeyond the sea.(1526) Such a liberal response was made to this\r\ninvitation(1527) that on the 7th June, 1566, Sir Thomas Gresham was able\r\nto lay the first stone of the new building, a deed of trust between the\r\nCity and Gresham having previously (14 May) been executed.(1528)\r\n\r\n(M753)\r\n\r\nIt is curious to note the strong foreign element in connection with the\r\nbuilding of Gresham's Burse. The architect as well as the design of the\r\nbuilding came from abroad. The clerk of the works (Henryk)(1529) and most\r\nof the workmen were foreigners, Gresham having obtained special permission\r\nfrom the Court of Aldermen for their employment.(1530) Most of the\r\nmaterial for structural as well as ornamental purposes (saving 100,000\r\nbricks provided by the City)(1531) came from abroad, and to this day the\r\nRoyal Exchange is paved with small blocks of Turkish hone-stones believed\r\nto have been imported in Gresham's day, and to have been relaid after the\r\nseveral fires of 1666 and 1838. It was the employment of these strangers\r\nwhich probably gave rise to an order of the Court of Aldermen (19 June,\r\n1567) that an officer should be appointed to attend at the Burse daily\r\n\"for a competent season,\" to see that no \"misorder\" be done to any of the\r\nartificers or other workmen there employed, and to commit to ward any that\r\nhe should find so-doing.(1532)\r\n\r\n(M754)\r\n\r\nBy the 22nd December, 1568, the Burse was so far complete as to allow of\r\nmerchants holding their meetings within its walls, but it was not until\r\nthe 23rd January, 1571, that the queen herself visited it in state and\r\ncaused it thenceforth to be called the Royal Exchange. Her statue which\r\ngraced the building bore testimony to the care and interest she always\r\ndisplayed in fostering commercial enterprise.\r\n\r\n(M755)\r\n\r\nOn the door of a staircase leading up to a \"pawne\" or covered walk on the\r\nsouth side of the building there had been set up the arms and crest of\r\nGresham himself, which some evilly disposed person took it into his head\r\nto deface. A proclamation made by the mayor (16 Feb., 1569) for the\r\napprehension of the culprit does not appear from the city's records to\r\nhave proved successful.(1533) Some years later (21 March, 1577) the mayor\r\nhad occasion to issue another proclamation for the discovery of persons\r\nwho had defaced and pulled away \"certen peces of timber fixed to thendes\r\nand comers of the seates\"(1534) in the Royal Exchange, with what result we\r\nknow not.\r\n\r\n(M756)\r\n\r\nIn 1574 the Court of Aldermen appointed a committee to confer with Gresham\r\ntouching the \"assurance\" of the Royal Exchange.(1535) The connection\r\nbetween the new Burse and insurance is remarkable. The principle of\r\ninsurance policies had been introduced into the city by the Lombards as\r\nearly as the thirteenth century,(1536) and a Lombard Street policy became\r\na familiar term.(1537) When the Lombard Street merchants quitted their old\r\npremises for the more commodious Exchange they carried thither their\r\ninsurance business with them, and a part of the new building was devoted\r\nexclusively to this branch of commerce. A grant of letters patent which\r\nElizabeth made to Richard Candler for the making of policies and\r\nregistering of assurances within the city was objected to by the Court of\r\nAldermen, as being contrary to the liberties of the City, and a deputation\r\nwas appointed to wait upon the lords of the Privy Council to have it\r\nrevoked.(1538) This was early in 1575. A year later we find Candler making\r\nanswer to a bill of fees drawn up by certain aldermen and citizens of\r\nLondon, respecting his office.(1539)\r\n\r\nIn order to put an end to the frequent disputes which arose in the Royal\r\nExchange among merchants on matters of insurance, the Court of Aldermen\r\nappointed two of their number to consider the difficulty and to report\r\nthereon. They made their report to the court on the 29th January,\r\n1577.(1540) They had, in accordance with the oft-repeated desire expressed\r\nto previous lord mayors by the lords of the Privy Council, consulted with\r\ntheir brethren the aldermen, as well as with merchants of the city, both\r\nEnglishmen and foreigners, and had drawn up orders agreeable to those that\r\nhad hitherto been used in Lombard Street, to which all countries had been\r\naccustomed to submit. The orders, however, not yet being completed, the\r\nCourt of Aldermen decided upon appointing arbitrators from year to year to\r\ndeal with all matters of insurance, and so relieve the lords of the Privy\r\nCouncil of the trouble which they had hitherto experienced on that score\r\nat a time when they had weightier matters to attend to. The arbitrators\r\nwere to receive one penny in the pound amongst them in all cases, whether\r\nthe claim were for whole losses, part,(1541) or averages. Their decision\r\nwas to bind both assurer and assured, and they were to sit twice a week\r\n(Monday and Thursday) \"in the offyce howse of assurances\" in the Royal\r\nExchange. They were to be attended by the \"register of assurances,\" whose\r\nbusiness it was to summon witnesses. A poor-box was to be provided, to\r\nwhich the party assured, on judgment, should contribute twelve pence.\r\n\r\n(M757)\r\n\r\nOn Sundays and holy days the Exchange was enlivened during a portion of\r\nthe year with the music of the city waits, who were ordered by the Court\r\nof Aldermen (April, 1572) to play on their instruments as they had\r\nhitherto been accustomed at the Royal Exchange, from seven o'clock till\r\neight o'clock in the evening up to the Feast of Pentecost, after which\r\nthey were to commence playing at eight p.m., and \"to hold on\" till nine\r\np.m. up to Michaelmas.(1542) There is another circumstance connected with\r\nthe same building that deserves a passing notice, which is that football\r\nused to be played within its walls, a game forbidden in 1576 to be played\r\nany longer either there or in any of the city's wards.(1543)\r\n\r\n(M758)\r\n\r\nThe citizens of London are indebted to Sir Thomas Gresham for something\r\nmore than their Royal Exchange. By will dated 5th July, 1575, proved and\r\nenrolled in the Court of Husting,(1544) Gresham disposed of the reversion\r\nof the Royal Exchange and of his mansion-house in the parish of St. Helen,\r\nBishopsgate, after the decease of his wife, to the mayor and corporation\r\nof the city and to the wardens and commonalty of the Mercers' Company in\r\nequal moieties in trust (_inter alia_) for the maintenance of seven\r\nlectures on the several subjects of Divinity, Astronomy, Music, Geometry,\r\nLaw, Physic and Rhetoric. In 1596 these two corporate bodies came into\r\npossession of the property, and in the following year drew up ordinances\r\nfor the regulation of the various lectures. According to the terms of\r\nGresham's will the lectures were delivered at Gresham House. When Gresham\r\nHouse, which escaped the Fire of London, became dilapidated, the City and\r\nthe Company on more than one occasion petitioned Parliament for leave to\r\npull it down and to erect another building on its site. The proposal,\r\nhowever, was not entertained, but in the year 1767 an Act was passed\r\nvesting Gresham House in the Crown for the purpose of an Excise Office,\r\nand providing for the payment by the Crown to the City and Company of a\r\nperpetual annuity of L500 per annum. For some time the lectures ceased to\r\nbe delivered for lack of accommodation. When they were next delivered it\r\nwas at the City of London School, where they continued until Gresham\r\nCollege was erected in Basinghall Street.(1545)\r\n\r\n(M759)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Protestantism had been gaining ground in England as well\r\nas on the continent. Many who in the evil days of the Marian persecution\r\nhad sought refuge in Switzerland and Germany had returned to England as\r\nsoon as they were assured of safety under Elizabeth, and had introduced\r\ninto the country the religious tenets of Calvin they had learnt abroad.\r\nElizabeth found herself confronted not only by Catholics but by Puritans.\r\nAs she felt herself seated more strongly on the throne she determined to\r\nenforce more strictly than hitherto the Act of Uniformity. In 1565 the\r\nLondon clergy were ordered to wear the surplice and to conform in other\r\nparticulars. Between thirty and forty of them--and those the most\r\nintelligent and active of them--refused and resigned their cures. Their\r\ncongregations supported them, and thus a large body of good Protestants\r\nwere driven into opposition. But there all action against them ceased. It\r\nwas otherwise with the Protestants on the continent, where a determination\r\narrived at in the same year that Elizabeth enforced the Act of Uniformity,\r\nto suppress heresy, led to the most horrible persecution, and drove many\r\nof the inhabitants to seek refuge in England.\r\n\r\n(M760)\r\n\r\nOf the hundreds of foreigners who sought this country, driven from France\r\nor Spain by religious persecution,(1546) none was more hospitably received\r\nthan the brother of the great Coligny, the Cardinal Chastillon. The Bishop\r\nof London having excused himself entertaining the cardinal at Fulham, his\r\neminence was lodged and hospitably treated for a whole week by Gresham.\r\nDuring his visit he paid a visit, Huguenot as he was, to the French Church\r\nestablished in the city, where his co-religionists were allowed to worship\r\nwithout fear of molestation. He further paid his host the compliment of\r\nvisiting the Exchange, then approaching completion. At the end of the week\r\nhe removed to Sion House, where accommodation had been found for\r\nhim.(1547)\r\n\r\n(M761)\r\n\r\nThe influx of refugees from the continent was far from being an unmixed\r\nblessing. Whilst some settled peacefully down and taught the London\r\nartizan the art of silk-weaving, others betook themselves to the river's\r\nside, where they defied the civic authorities.(1548) A fresh return was\r\nordered to be made of their number.(1549) It became necessary to forbid\r\naliens remaining in the city more than a day and a night; they might\r\nreside in other places if they liked, but not in the city of London.(1550)\r\nMortality increased so much that a committee hud to be appointed (March,\r\n1569) \"to peruse about the cytie where apte and convenient places maye be\r\nhad and founde for the buryall of the deade in tyme of plage and other\r\ntymes of gret deathe,\" and to report thereon to the Court of\r\nAldermen.(1551) An acre of ground, more or less, near Bethlem Hospital was\r\nsubsequently prepared as a cemetery by the civic authorities,(1552) whilst\r\na friend of the mayor agreed under certain conditions to enclose it with a\r\nwall, erect a pulpit and make other improvements at his own cost.(1553)\r\n\r\n(M762)\r\n\r\nIn the course of time the persecuted Netherlanders took heart of grace,\r\nencouraged by the gallant conduct of the Prince of Orange, their leader,\r\nno less than by the active assistance and sympathy of their brethren in\r\nEngland, who were continually passing to and fro with munitions of war, in\r\nspite of proclamations to the contrary.(1554) \"Whilst Elizabeth dribbled\r\nout her secret aid to the Prince of Orange the London traders sent him\r\nhalf-a-million from their own purses, a sum equal to a year's revenue of\r\nthe Crown.\"(1555)\r\n\r\n(M763) (M764)\r\n\r\nThe decline of Antwerp which followed Alva's administration marks the\r\nfoundation of London's supremacy in the world of commerce. Hitherto the\r\nqueen had been accustomed through Gresham, her factor, to raise what money\r\nshe required by loans from merchants abroad. Merchant strangers were well\r\ncontent to lend her money at ten or twelve per cent., seeing that the City\r\nof London was as often as not called upon to give bonds for repayment by\r\nway of collateral security.(1556) When that door was closed to her she\r\nturned to her own subjects, the Company of Merchant Adventurers, to whom\r\nshe had shown considerable favour. Her first application to this company\r\nfor a loan was, to her great surprise, refused. The matter was afterwards\r\naccommodated through the intervention of Sir Thomas Gresham; and as the\r\nconfidence of the city merchants increased, loans were afterwards\r\nfrequently negotiated between them and the Crown, much to the convenience\r\nof one party and to the advantage of the other.(1557)\r\n\r\n(M765)\r\n\r\nAs another means of raising money Elizabeth had resort to a lottery--the\r\nfirst public lottery ever held in London, although the game called \"The\r\nLott\" was not unknown in the city in the reign of Henry VIII.(1558) The\r\nlottery was advertised in 1567 as being a very rich lottery general,\r\nwithout any blanks, containing a number of good prizes of ready-money,\r\nplate and divers sorts of merchandise, the same having been valued by\r\nexpert and skilful men. The lottery was, as we should say at the present\r\nday, \"under the immediate patronage\" of the queen herself, and the\r\nproceeds, after deducting expenses, were to be devoted to the repair of\r\nharbours and other public works conducive to strengthening the realm.\r\nBesides the prizes, of which a long list is set out in the city's records,\r\nthere were to be three \"welcomes\" or bonuses given to the first three\r\nwinners of lots. The first person to whom a lot should happen to fall was\r\nto have for \"welcome\" a piece of silver-gilt plate of the value of L50,\r\nand the second and third fortunate drawers were to have respectively, in\r\naddition to their prizes, a piece of gilt plate of the value of L20. The\r\nprizes, the chief of which amounted to L5,000 sterling, although the\r\nwinner was to receive only L3,000 in cash, the rest being taken out in\r\nplate and tapestry,(1559) were exhibited in Cheapside at the sign of the\r\nQueen's Arms, the house of Antony Derick, goldsmith to Elizabeth and\r\nengraver to the Mint in this and the preceding reign.(1560) The mayor and\r\naldermen agreed to put into the lottery thirty \"billes or lottes\" at the\r\nleast under one posy, viz.:--_God preserve the Cytye of London quod M and\r\nA._ Any profit that might arise from the lots was to be equally divided\r\nbetween them.(1561)\r\n\r\nThe livery companies of the city were also invited to subscribe to the\r\nlottery as well as the Company of Merchant Adventurers.(1562) On the 4th\r\nAugust the livery of the Merchant Taylors' Company were summoned to their\r\nhall to declare the amount each individual was ready to venture--\"all under\r\nour posy in the name of this Common Hall,\" the posy subsequently\r\ndetermined upon being the following:--\r\n\r\n  \"One byrde in hande is worthe two in the woode,\r\n  Yff wee have the greate lott it will do us good.\"(1563)\r\n\r\nThe \"reading\" of the lottery was postponed till the 10th January,\r\n1569.(1564) It took place at the west door of St. Paul's, commencing on\r\nthe 11th day of that month, and continued day and night until the 6th May\r\nfollowing.(1565) It was reported at the time that Elizabeth withdrew a\r\nlarge sum of the prize-money for her own use previous to the drawing of\r\nthe lots, and this report, whether well founded or not, created no little\r\ndisgust among the subscribers.(1566)\r\n\r\n(M766) (M767)\r\n\r\nBefore the close of 1568 Alva had severed the last links connecting\r\nEngland with the Low Countries by suddenly seizing and imprisoning all\r\nEnglish merchants found at Antwerp on the ground that certain Spanish\r\ntreasure-ships had been detained in England. Such conduct on his part was\r\ncharacterized by Elizabeth as \"verie straunge and hertofore in no tyme\r\nused betwixt the Crowne of England and the House of Burgondye wt owt some\r\nmanner of former conferrence proceedyng and intelligence had of the myndes\r\nand intentions of the prynces themselves on both sides,\" and she forthwith\r\nissued a proclamation for the seizure of Spanish vessels and merchants\r\nfound in English ports by way of reprisal.(1567) She was careful to show\r\nthat any former detention of Spanish vessels served as a mere pretence for\r\nAlva's conduct. Certain Spanish vessels of small tonnage, called \"zabras,\"\r\nhad, it was true, entered English harbours in the west country, and the\r\nbullion and merchandise had been discharged on English soil; but all this\r\nhad been done in order to prevent the ships and cargo falling into the\r\nhands of the French ships which threatened them. Some of the treasure had\r\nbeen even \"borrowed\"; but this was not contrary to the honorable usage of\r\nprinces in their own dominions. The Spanish ambassador had called upon her\r\nmajesty to ask that the vessels and cargo might be given up, \"pretending\r\nthe monye to appertaine to the king his maister,\" which her majesty had\r\ndeclared her willingness to assent to as soon as she should have had\r\ncommunication from the west country. The ambassador, who was asked to\r\nreturn in four or five days to receive the ships and treasure, had failed\r\nto appear, and her surprise was great to find that orders had been given\r\nfor the arrest of her subjects at Antwerp on the very day (29 Oct.) that\r\nthe Spanish ambassador was with her majesty. Such was the account of the\r\nmatter as given in the queen's proclamation to the citizens of London. But\r\nthere are other and contradictory accounts. Whoever may have been the\r\nrightful owner of the treasure, which in all probability was on its way to\r\nFlanders for payment of Alva's soldiers,(1568) the opportunity of dealing\r\na blow to Spain and at the same time of replenishing the Exchequer at home\r\nafforded by the presence of the ships in English waters was thought too\r\ngood to be lost.\r\n\r\n(M768)\r\n\r\nOn the 5th January the mayor received orders from Sir Nicholas Bacon to\r\nseize all Flemings' goods to the queen's use, inasmuch as it was quite\r\npossible that what had taken place in Flanders had been done without the\r\nKing of Spain's commission. The following day the mayor informed the\r\ncouncil that he had arrested the bodies and goods of certain merchant\r\nstrangers in the city.(1569) Throughout the greater part of the month\r\nfrequent letters passed between the city, the merchant adventurers, the\r\nmerchants of the staple and the lords of the council concerning Alva's\r\nproceedings and measures to be taken by way of reprisal. The citizens\r\nshowed themselves very anxious to devise measures of retaliation and to\r\navail themselves to the utmost of the opportunity afforded them of\r\navenging themselves of their foreign rivals, as the following memorial\r\nsigned by the mayor and nine of the principal merchants of the city\r\nproves:--(1570)\r\n\r\n\"First, we doe thinck it very needfull and necessary that wth all possible\r\nspeed the bodies, shipps and goodes of all the subiects of the said king\r\nbe had under arrest, and their bodies to be sequestred from their houses,\r\ncomptinghouses, books, warehouses and goods; and they themselves to be\r\ncommitted unto severall and sure custodie and keeping. And that alsoe\r\ncomission may be granted to sage persons to enquire and trie out all\r\ncoulorable transports and contracts don since the XXth of December last by\r\nany of the subiects of the said king or by any other nation. And that a\r\nproclamation be made by the queene's mates aucthorite forthwth for the\r\navoiding of collorable bargaines, transports and contracts hereafter to be\r\nmade.\"\r\n\r\nThomas Rowe(1571) (he had not yet received the honour of knighthood), who\r\nwas mayor at the time, happened to be a connection by marriage of Sir\r\nThomas Gresham, having married Mary, the eldest daughter of Sir John\r\nGresham, of Titsey, Sir Thomas's uncle. It was owing to this connection\r\nthat the mayor received information of Alva's arbitrary proceedings before\r\nthe news reached the ears of Secretary Cecil; for Gresham's factor at\r\nAntwerp, Richard Clough, had lost no time in despatching a special\r\nmessenger to his master, who, immediately after hearing the news, broke in\r\nupon the mayor's slumbers at twelve o'clock on the night of the 3rd\r\nJanuary in order to communicate the same to him. The next morning the\r\nmayor wrote to Sir William Cecil informing him of what had occurred and\r\nhow under the circumstances he (the mayor) had taken upon himself to stay\r\nthe despatch of letters abroad for a while.(1572)\r\n\r\n(M769)\r\n\r\nTowards the end of January, 1569, the Duke of Alva sent over an agent,\r\nMonsieur D'Assoleville, to demand the restitution of the treasure. The\r\nmayor deputed John Gresham and another to escort the envoy from Gravesend\r\nto London, where he was lodged at Crosby Place, at that time the mansion\r\nhouse of William Bond, alderman of Candlewick Street Ward.(1573) At first\r\nhe demanded an audience with the queen herself, but was fain to be content\r\nwith a reference to her council.(1574) The treasure in the meantime had\r\nbeen removed to London for greater security.(1575) Negotiations proving\r\nfruitless the agent returned to Antwerp, \"having succeeded in obtaining\r\nfrom Elizabeth nothing beyond the assurance that she was ready to\r\nsurrender the treasure when his master promised indemnity to all her\r\nsubjects in the Low Countries, and agreed solemnly to ratify the ancient\r\ntreaty of alliance between the Crown of England and the House of\r\nBurgundy.\"(1576)\r\n\r\n(M770)\r\n\r\nThat such a large amount of treasure should be lying idle did not commend\r\nitself to the mind of so astute a financier as Sir Thomas Gresham. He\r\naccordingly suggested to Sir William Cecil by letter (14 Aug., 1569) that\r\nthe queen should cause it to be minted into her own coin, and thereby make\r\na profit of L3,000 or L4,000. As for repayment, her majesty could effect\r\nit by way of exchange, to her great profit, or give bonds for a year or\r\nmore to the merchants who owned the money, and who, in Gresham's opinion,\r\nwould willingly accede to such proposal.(1577) Bold as this suggestion\r\nwas, it appears, nevertheless, to have been carried into execution.(1578)\r\n\r\n(M771)\r\n\r\nThe hardships already experienced by Spanish merchants from stoppage of\r\ncommercial intercourse with England must have been materially increased\r\nthe following year by an order of the Court of Aldermen (11 July, 1570) to\r\nthe effect that all matters and suits brought by merchant strangers,\r\nsubjects of the King of Spain, in any of the Queen's Majesty's Courts\r\nwithin the city of London for the recovery of a debt should be stayed, and\r\nno manner of arrest or attachment allowed until further notice, unless the\r\nstranger suing were a denizen or a member of the Church.(1579)\r\n\r\n(M772) (M773) (M774)\r\n\r\nBy proclamation made the last day of June, 1570, English merchants who had\r\nsuffered loss by Alva's proceedings were desired to make a return of such\r\nloss to the officers of one or other of the cities or towns of London,\r\nSouthampton, Bristol, Chester, Newcastle, Hull or Ipswich, as they should\r\nfind it most convenient,(1580) and on the 20th July following every\r\nEnglishman into whose hands any goods belonging to Spanish subjects might\r\nhave come was ordered to make a certificate under his hand and seal into\r\nthe Court of the Admiralty, in the city of London, for her majesty to take\r\nfurther order thereon as should be thought meet.(1581) Negotiations, which\r\nhad been renewed for mutual restitution, again broke down, for when the\r\nterms on which restitution was to be effected were to be reduced to\r\nwriting, or, in the language of the record, \"_put into mundum_,\"(1582) the\r\nSpanish commissioners were found to have no authority to arrange matters,\r\nwhilst at the same time they wished to introduce clauses and conditions\r\nwhich Elizabeth could in no wise accept. Seeing that she was being played\r\nwith, and knowing that much of the goods of English merchants seized in\r\nSpain and the Netherlands had already been sold, the queen determined to\r\nput up for sale the Spanish merchandise which for three years had been in\r\nEnglish hands. Proclamation to this effect was made the 14th January,\r\n1572.(1583) The queen showed every desire to treat the Spanish merchants\r\nwith consideration. The sale was entrusted to Spanish subjects, who, upon\r\ntheir oath, were to make sale of all the ships, goods, wares and\r\nmerchandise arrested, to the utmost advantage they could; and Spanish\r\nowners were allowed, either by themselves, their factor or attorney,\r\nfreely to enter the realm within thirty days after the date of the\r\nproclamation to attend the sale, provided they made no attempt against her\r\nmajesty or the peace of the country and departed immediately the sale was\r\nover. This proclamation, coupled with the hopelessness of Alva's case and\r\nthe manifestation of discontent displayed by his own ruined merchants, led\r\nto articles being drawn up (25 Mar.) between Elizabeth and the King of\r\nSpain for an adjustment of their respective claims. Sir Thomas Gresham had\r\npreviously (4 Feb.) been directed by letter from Lord Burghley and Sir\r\nWalter Mildmay to deliver up certain bonds of the Governor and Company of\r\nMerchant Adventurers to be cancelled now that the whole matter was to be\r\nreferred to arbitration.(1584)\r\n\r\n(M775)\r\n\r\nTo add to the queen's difficulties, Mary, who had been deposed from the\r\nthrone of Scotland and had sought shelter in England, was importuning her\r\nfor assistance for the recovery of her lost crown. Whilst Elizabeth\r\nhesitated either to replace her rival in power or to set her at liberty,\r\nthe Earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland endeavoured to carry out a\r\nscheme for marrying Mary to the Duke of Norfolk and forcing Elizabeth to\r\nacknowledge her as successor to the crown of England. The Duke of Norfolk\r\nobeyed the queen's summons to attend the court, and was committed to the\r\nTower (Oct., 1569).(1585) The earls refused to obey the summons, and rose\r\nin insurrection. On the 24th November they were proclaimed traitors.(1586)\r\nTroops were sent against them, but they cowardly left their supporters to\r\ntheir own fate and fled to Scotland. The rebellion, fruitless as it proved\r\nto be, caused no little excitement in the city.\r\n\r\n(M776)\r\n\r\nThe same day that the earls were proclaimed traitors the Mayor of London\r\nissued his precept to the several aldermen, enjoining them to take steps\r\nfor safe-guarding the city and taking into custody all rogues, masterless\r\nmen and vagabonds.(1587) On the following day another precept was issued\r\nto the several livery companies for providing a certain number of\r\nsoldiers, \"well and sufficientlie furnyshed wth a jerkyn and a paire of\r\ngally sloppes of broad clothe, collor watchet, one calyver wth flaske and\r\ntuchebox, a moryan, a sworde and a dagger.\"(1588) The soldiers were to be\r\nready to serve her majesty at an hour's warning. The Chamberlain received\r\norders to amend the several gates of the city and the portcullises\r\nbelonging to them, as well as to repair the city's guns and put them in\r\nreadiness, and lay in a stock of powder and shot to serve as occasion\r\nshould require.(1589) By the 12th December all fear of immediate danger\r\nhad passed away, and the livery companies were ordered to receive back the\r\narmour and weapons supplied to the soldiers and to keep them in their\r\nhall. The men were to be dismissed to their several industries, but still\r\nto hold themselves in readiness for service at an hour's warning if\r\noccasion should require them. A week later the soldiers were dismissed to\r\ntheir houses, those who had no house being allowed sixpence a day until\r\ncalled upon for active service.(1590)\r\n\r\n(M777)\r\n\r\nAlthough the rising in the north had failed, the Catholics were not\r\nwithout hope. They were encouraged by the issue of a Papal Bull\r\nexcommunicating Elizabeth and absolving her subjects from their\r\nallegiance. This Bull was affixed to the door of the Bishop of London's\r\npalace by a man named John Felton. The queen was alarmed. She believed\r\nthat the long-threatened union against her of the Catholic powers had at\r\nlength been effected. Felton was seized and tried at the Guildhall. He was\r\nfound guilty, and paid the penalty of his rashness by being hanged, drawn\r\nand quartered.(1591) His exemplary punishment failed, however, to put a\r\nstop to Catholic intrigues against Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n(M778)\r\n\r\nThe defeat of the Turkish fleet at Lepanto by Don John of Austria (7 Oct.,\r\n1571) was commemorated two days later in London by a thanksgiving service\r\nat St. Paul's,(1592) which was attended by the mayor, Sir William\r\nAllen,(1593) the aldermen and members of the companies in their liveries.\r\nIn the evening of the same day bonfires were lighted in the streets of the\r\ncity by precept of the mayor.(1594) The immediate effect of the victory\r\nwas the release of a large number of captives (variously estimated at\r\n12,000 and 14,000)(1595) from Turkish slavery, for whose redemption the\r\ncitizens were constantly being called upon to subscribe.(1596)\r\n\r\n(M779)\r\n\r\nWhilst the Low Countries were winning their way to freedom from the\r\nSpanish yoke, and France was suffering the horrors of Saint Bartholomew's\r\nday (24 Aug., 1572), England remained tranquil, and the city merchant had\r\nlittle cause to complain, except, it might be, on account of the number of\r\nstrangers who rivalled him in his business.(1597) For the better\r\npreservation of peace members of the French and the Dutch churches were\r\nordered (28 Sept.) not to leave their houses after 9 o'clock at\r\nnight.(1598)\r\n\r\n(M780)\r\n\r\nSo long as the Spanish king turned a deaf ear to the exhortations of the\r\nPope, and refused to make a descent upon England, Elizabeth was able to\r\ncope with Catholicism at home by peaceful measures. But the time was\r\napproaching when she could no longer refuse to give practical assistance\r\nto her struggling co-religionists on the continent. The Netherlands had\r\nfor some time past been preparing for open revolt against the barbarous\r\ngovernment of Alva. In 1572 a party seized Brill, and thus laid the\r\nfoundation of the Dutch Republic. It wanted but the active adhesion of\r\nElizabeth to enable the French to drive the Spaniards out of the country,\r\nbut this the queen was as yet unwilling to give. Two years later (1574)\r\nshe offered her services to effect an understanding between Spain and the\r\nNetherlands, but her mediation proved futile. Both in 1572 and 1574 there\r\nare signs of military preparations having taken place in the city. In the\r\nfirst mentioned year Elizabeth held a review of the city troops in\r\nGreenwich Park.(1599) In 1574 the city was called upon to furnish 400\r\nsoldiers for the queen's service, and steps were taken to allot to the\r\nlivery companies their quota of men or money in view of future\r\ncalls.(1600) A store of gunpowder was also laid up.(1601)\r\n\r\n(M781)\r\n\r\nIf one thing more than another was calculated to precipitate a rupture\r\nbetween England and Spain it was the action of English seamen, who roved\r\nthe seas and indirectly rendered assistance to the Netherlanders by\r\nplundering Spanish vessels, in spite of all proclamations to the\r\ncontrary.(1602) The Londoner was not behind-hand in this predatory\r\nwarfare.\r\n\r\n(M782) (M783)\r\n\r\nIn June, 1575, the queen borrowed a sum of L30,000 from the citizens on\r\nsecurity.(1603) The money was subscribed by the wealthier class of\r\ncitizens, and a moiety of the loan was repaid in little more than a\r\ntwelvemonth.(1604) Whatever may have been her faults, Elizabeth honestly\r\npaid her debts, and when she discovered in 1577 that money which she had\r\nrepaid to certain officials had not reached the hands of the original\r\ncreditor, she forthwith issued a proclamation commanding all such\r\ncreditors to send in their claims in writing to the chief officer of her\r\nmajesty's household.(1605) It is difficult to dissociate altogether this\r\nproclamation from the removal of George Heton from the office of\r\nChamberlain of the City three months afterwards.(1606)\r\n\r\n(M784)\r\n\r\nIn February, 1578, the City was called upon to provide 2,000 arquebusiers.\r\nRefusal was useless, although an attempt was made to get the number\r\nreduced to 500. The mayor had scarcely issued his precept to the aldermen\r\nto raise the men before he received another order for 2,000 to be trained\r\nas directed in handling and using their weapons and kept in readiness for\r\nfuture service.(1607) One hundred and fifty men were ordered (12 June) to\r\nbe ready at an hour's notice for foreign service.(1608) Strangers and\r\nforeigners were not exempt.(1609) Some of the city companies were slow in\r\npaying their quota of expenses of fitting out the men, and pressure had to\r\nbe brought to bear on them by the Court of Aldermen.(1610)\r\n\r\n(M785) (M786) (M787)\r\n\r\nIn the following year Casimir, Count Palatine of the Rhine, paid a visit\r\nto England to answer a charge brought against him by the English envoy in\r\nHolland, of having used forces against the Netherlanders which had been\r\ndespatched from these shores for their support. On the evening of\r\nThursday, the 22nd January, 1579, the Count landed at the Tower, where he\r\nwas received by a party of noblemen and others, among whom we may\r\nconjecture was the Mayor of London and representatives of the city.(1611)\r\nThence he was conducted by the light of cressets to Gresham's house, in\r\nBishopsgate Street, where he was received with music and lodged and\r\nfeasted by the worthy owner for three days. The honour thus shown to\r\nGresham is only one more proof of the esteem and respect in which he was\r\nuniversally held by all parties, and, \"in truth,\" as his biographer justly\r\nremarks,(1612) \"his great experience, his long and familiar intercourse\r\nwith men of all grades and professions, from princes and nobles--with whom\r\n... he was on as intimate a footing as the impassable barrier of rank will\r\npermit--to the lowliest of his own dependants, the knowledge of men and\r\nmanners which he must have derived from foreign travel, and his\r\nacquaintance with all the languages of civilised Europe, must have\r\nrendered him, towards the close of his life especially, as favourable a\r\nspecimen as could have been selected of the English gentleman of that\r\nday.\" Casimir's reception was one of the last acts of public service\r\nperformed by Gresham, for before the close of the year he had died (21\r\nNov.). On Sunday (25 Jan.) the Count was conducted to Westminster for an\r\ninterview with the queen, after which lodgings were assigned to him in\r\nSomerset House. The court of Common Council had already (23 Jan.) voted\r\n\"Duke Cassimerus\" a gratification \"in moneye or anye other thinge\" to the\r\nvalue of 500 marks.(1613) His visit was one round of feasting, hunting and\r\nsight-seeing; one day dining with the lord mayor, another with the\r\nmerchants of the Steelyard; one day hunting at Hampton Court, and another\r\nday witnessing athletic sports at Westminster. That the Count succeeded in\r\nclearing his character may be surmised from the fact of his receiving the\r\nOrder of the Garter before his departure.(1614)\r\n\r\n(M788)\r\n\r\nIn the following year the plague, which had been very virulent towards the\r\nend of 1577, and from which the city was seldom entirely free, appeared at\r\nRye (June, 1580). A twelvemonth later it was raging in London, but as the\r\nweather grew colder its virulence abated, allowing of the resumption of\r\nthe lord mayor's feast. The respite was short. In the spring of 1582 it\r\nwas again rife in the city, increasing in fatality during the hot season\r\nand continuing until the winter of 1583.(1615) Business was often at a\r\nstandstill, the law courts had to be removed to the country, and the\r\nsittings of the London Husting suspended.(1616)\r\n\r\nSt. Paul's Churchyard, which served as the burial ground to no less than\r\ntwenty-three city parishes, became overcrowded and greatly added to the\r\ninsanitary condition of the city by its shallow graves. The mayor informed\r\nthe lords of the council of this state of affairs by letter (15 May,\r\n1582), in which he says that scarcely any grave was then made without\r\nexposing corpses, and that the heat of the crowds standing over the\r\nshallow graves caused noxious exhalations. It was currently reported at\r\nthe time that the gravediggers were the cause of the shallow graves \"as\r\nbeing desirous to have the infection spred that they might gaine by\r\nburieng.\"(1617)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(M789)\r\n\r\nThe time was fast approaching when the queen would find herself unable any\r\nlonger to maintain her frequent cry to the council board, \"No war, my\r\nlords, no war!\" and she began to concert measures to frustrate any attempt\r\nthat might be made to attack her crown and realm by the subtle device of\r\nthe Pope's emissaries or the more open hostility of Philip.\r\n\r\n(M790)\r\n\r\nThere were two ways in which the Pope and Spain could attack England, the\r\none by making a descent upon the coast, the other by undermining the\r\nloyalty of the queen's subjects by the aid of missionaries. A descent upon\r\nthe English coast was, for the present at least, out of the question, but\r\nit was possible to wound England by fostering insurrection in Ireland.\r\nAccordingly, in 1579, a large force landed at Limerick under the authority\r\nof the Pope. It was, however, overpowered and destroyed by Lord Grey, the\r\nlord deputy.(1618)\r\n\r\nThen followed the rebellion under the Earl of Desmond, who six years\r\nbefore had regained his liberty on a promise to use his influence to\r\ndestroy the Catholic religion in Ireland.(1619) Throughout the Desmond\r\nrebellion the Londoners were constantly being called upon to furnish men\r\nand munition of war. The trouble was protracted by the landing of a force\r\nof 800 men from Spain, with the connivance, if not with the authority, of\r\nPhilip. When the rebellion was suppressed distress drove many Irish to\r\nEngland, and the city became their chief refuge.(1620) A special day was\r\nappointed for apprehending \"all suche rogishe and begging Ireishe people\r\nas well men weomen as children\" as should be found wandering abroad in the\r\ncity,(1621) and steps were taken subsequently to convey all Irish beggars\r\nto Bristol with the view of sending them back to their native land.(1622)\r\n\r\n(M791)\r\n\r\nWhilst appealing to force to accomplish their object in Ireland, the\r\nCatholics resorted to intrigue to gain the same object in England and\r\nScotland. For some years past there had been a steady flow from the\r\ncontinent of seminary priests, who worked silently and secretly making\r\nconverts to the old religion. Every precaution was taken to prevent their\r\ninculcating their dangerous opinions into the minds of the inhabitants of\r\nthe city and drawing them off from their allegiance to the queen and to\r\nthe established Church. The aldermen were instructed to make return of\r\nthose in their ward who refused to attend church. This was in 1568.(1623)\r\nIn 1574 all strangers who had crept into the city under colour of religion\r\nand were found to be of no church were ordered to leave.(1624) In the\r\nfollowing year (9 June, 1575) every stranger was called upon to subscribe\r\nthe Articles of religion before he was allowed to take up his residence\r\nwithin the city, and those who refused to subscribe or to attend church\r\nwere to give bond for their appearance before her Majesty's Commissioners\r\nfor Ecclesiastical Causes to answer such matters as should be objected\r\nagainst them.(1625) The aldermen were instructed to make diligent search\r\nin their several wards for such as held conventicles under colour of\r\nreligion and inter-meddled with matters of State and civil\r\ngovernance.(1626) In 1580 a regular Jesuit mission, under two priests,\r\nCampion and Parsons, was despatched to England as part of an organised\r\nCatholic scheme. Campion had at one time been a fellow of St. John's\r\nCollege, Oxford. Their first step was to remove a difficulty under which\r\ndevout Catholics had laboured ever since the issue of the Bull of\r\nexcommunication against Elizabeth in 1571. That Bull had reduced them to\r\nthe necessity of choosing between disobedience to the Church and treason\r\nto the queen. The new missionaries helped them out of the dilemma by\r\nexplaining that the censures of the Church only applied to heretics;\r\nCatholics might feign allegiance and the Church would say nothing.\r\n\r\n(M792)\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances it can scarcely be wondered at that the\r\ngovernment proceeded to strong measures--A proclamation was issued\r\nrequiring English parents to remove their children from foreign\r\nseminaries, and declaring that to harbour Jesuit priests was to harbour\r\nrebels;(1627) whilst parliament imposed fines upon all who refused to\r\nattend the service of the established Church, in addition to the penalties\r\nimposed in 1571 upon those who claimed to absolve subjects from their\r\nallegiance and to receive them into the Church of Rome. In the city a\r\nstrict watch was again ordered to be kept on all those who failed to\r\nattend regularly their parish church.(1628) It was further proposed to\r\nappoint special preachers to counteract the baneful influence of the\r\nJesuit priest, and the Bishop of London was ordered to make a list of the\r\nbest preachers and to appoint them districts.(1629)\r\n\r\n(M793)\r\n\r\nThese instructions Bishop Aylmer forwarded to the lord mayor with a\r\nrequest for a contribution to enable him and his associates, the dean of\r\nSt. Paul's and the dean of Windsor, to carry them into effect. The mayor\r\nreplied (6 Sept., 1581) that, as for himself, his office was already so\r\nburdensome, both in work and expense, that it would go hard with him if he\r\nwas called upon to pay more than any other parishioner in a Church matter.\r\nBoth he and his brethren the aldermen were no less desirous than others to\r\npromote the knowledge of true religion and to inculcate obedience to the\r\nqueen by lectures in the city, but the commons would have to be consulted\r\nfirst. He enclosed a list of lectures already established in the several\r\nparishes, and drew attention to the great yearly charge incurred by the\r\ncompanies and private persons in the city in maintaining students at the\r\nuniversities to serve the Church in the office of preaching and\r\nreading.(1630) This expense, the mayor said, warranted the City and the\r\nCompanies asking to be no further burdened. The writer concluded by\r\nintimating that, however willing the corporation might be to assist in the\r\ngood work, its ability to do so had been much diminished by the indiscreet\r\ndemeanour of the bishop's own chaplain, Mr. Dyos, who had recently defamed\r\nthe citizens in a public sermon at Paul's Cross, \"as favorers of userers,\r\nof the familye of love and puritanes,\" saying \"that if the appointing of\r\npreachers were committed to us we wold appointe preachers such as should\r\ndefend usirie, the familie of love and puritanisme as they call it.\" The\r\nCity was liable to make mistakes, just as the bishop himself had made a\r\nmistake in appointing so indiscreet a person for his chaplain, but in\r\nother respects they had no cause to reproach themselves in the matter of\r\nappointments. In conclusion they desired his lordship to take order for\r\nthe reparation of their good fame.\r\n\r\nHitherto the City had received no direct communications from the Privy\r\nCouncil on the subject, but three days after the date of the lord mayor's\r\nletter to the Bishop of London the lords of the council made a direct\r\nappeal to the mayor and aldermen suggesting that a collection should be\r\nmade among the clergy and other inhabitants of the city in order to\r\n\"oppose the supersticion of popery wch by the coming over of divers\r\nJesuits and seminarie preistes hath ben of late much increased.\"(1631)\r\nLittle appears to have been done in the matter by the civic authorities\r\nuntil the beginning of the next year, when the first step was taken by the\r\nappointment of a committee (25 Jan., 1582).(1632)\r\n\r\n(M794)\r\n\r\nCampion meanwhile had been arrested and subjected to cruel torture. He was\r\neventually executed. Parsons, his companion, escaped to the continent,\r\nwhere he continued to carry on an intrigue against the life of Elizabeth\r\nin conjunction with Allen, who some years before had established the\r\nfamous seminary at Donay for the purpose of keeping up a supply of Jesuit\r\npriests for England.\r\n\r\n(M795)\r\n\r\nIn 1583--soon after Edward Osborne(1633) had been elected to the\r\nmayoralty--a conspiracy, which had long been on foot, for the assassination\r\nof Elizabeth and the invasion of England by a French army was discovered.\r\nMatters began to look serious, and it behoved the queen to dismiss the\r\nSpanish ambassador from England (Jan., 1584) and to see to her forces.\r\nLord Burghley drew up \"a memoryall of dyvers thynges nesessary to be\r\nthought of and to be put in execution for this sommer for ye strength of\r\nye realme to serve for martiall defence ageynst ether rebellion or\r\ninvasion,\"(1634) containing suggestions for holding musters and training\r\nsoldiers. The navy was got ready for sea.\r\n\r\n(M796)\r\n\r\nIn April (1584) the City received orders to muster 4,000 men and to revive\r\nthe military shows on the eve of the Feasts of St. John the Baptist and\r\nSt. Peter the Apostle as accustomed to be held in the days of Henry VIII.\r\nThese displays had gradually fallen into desuetude; it was now the queen's\r\npolicy to renew them.(1635) The citizens showed themselves equal to the\r\nemergency, and \"mustered and skirmished\" daily at Mile End and St.\r\nGeorge's Field, so that in little more than a month they were in a fit\r\nstate of discipline and training to appear in Greenwich Park before the\r\nqueen herself, who thanked them graciously for their energy and pains, and\r\ndeclared that she had no subjects more ready to suppress disloyalty and to\r\ndefend her person.(1636)\r\n\r\n(M797)\r\n\r\nIn July news arrived of the assassination of the Prince of Orange (10\r\nJuly). Englishmen well knew that those who plotted against his life were\r\nplotting also against the life of their queen, and with wonderful\r\nunanimity--Catholics and Protestants alike--they joined in a \"Bond of\r\nAssociation\" for the defence of her majesty's person. The terms of the\r\nassociation were afterwards embodied in a bill and submitted to\r\nparliament, specially summoned for the purpose.(1637)\r\n\r\n(M798)\r\n\r\nStaggered by the sudden loss of their beloved leader, the Netherlanders\r\ndespatched envoys the following year (1585) to England offering to\r\nacknowledge Elizabeth as their sovereign. Upon their arrival in London the\r\nenvoys were lodged and hospitably entertained--although not at the City's\r\nexpense--in Clothworkers' Hall,(1638) and on the 29th June were received in\r\naudience by the queen at Greenwich. After much hesitation, as was her\r\nwont, she at last consented to take the Netherlands under her protection\r\nand to despatch troops to their assistance, but only on condition that the\r\nStates gave security for expenses to be incurred.(1639)\r\n\r\n(M799)\r\n\r\nOn the 9th July the mayor, Sir Thomas Pullison,(1640) issued his precept\r\nto the aldermen for each to make a survey in his ward of all such persons\r\nas were suitable and willing for service in the Low Countries, where it\r\nwas intended they should have good allowance.(1641)\r\n\r\n(M800)\r\n\r\nEvery effort was made to save Antwerp, but it was too late. By chaffering\r\nand bargaining with the envoys Elizabeth had lost her opportunity and\r\nAntwerp fell (19 Aug.). She could be resolute at times, but it wanted much\r\nto rouse her into activity. The news of Antwerp's fall administered to her\r\nthe necessary incitement to deal \"roundly and resolutely\" with her new\r\nallies. Fresh forces were despatched to Flanders under the Earl of\r\nLeicester, making in all some 10,000 men that had already been sent\r\nthither, nearly one-fourth of which had been furnished by the city of\r\nLondon.(1642) The queen grumbled at having to send so many--\"I have sent a\r\nfine heap of folk thither, in all ... not under 10,000 soldiers of the\r\nEnglish nation,\" said she to the envoys in October(1643)--and she kept the\r\nearl so short of money that he had to mortgage his estate.(1644) The City\r\ndid what it could and made him a present of L500 in \"newe angells,\" but\r\nthe City itself was in pecuniary difficulties and was compelled to borrow\r\nor \"take up\" money to defend its title to its own lands,(1645) which had\r\nbeen in constant jeopardy ever since the appointment of the royal\r\ncommission to search for \"concealed lands\" in 1567.(1646)\r\n\r\n(M801)\r\n\r\nThe direct effect of the fall of Antwerp upon the city of London was to\r\nflood its streets more than ever with strangers, and on the 30th October,\r\n1585, the mayor was once more called upon by the lords of the Privy\r\nCouncil to make a return of the number of strangers within the city, and\r\nmore especially of the number of French and Flemish strangers that had\r\narrived \"sithens the beginninge of the presente trobles moved by the house\r\nof Guise in Fraunce and the rendringe of the towne of Andwerpe.\"(1647) In\r\nApril and May of the following year (1586) the year of the disastrous\r\nbattle at Zutphen and of the death of the _Chevalier sans peur et sans\r\nreproche_, Sir Philip Sidney--another call was made in the city for\r\nvolunteers for service in the Low Countries,(1648) and the civic companies\r\nwere ordered to lay in a stock of gunpowder to be ready \"uppon eny\r\nymminent occacioun.\"(1649)\r\n\r\n(M802)\r\n\r\nWhilst operations, more or less active, were being carried on in the\r\nNetherlands against Spain, a new Catholic conspiracy against the life of\r\nElizabeth, with Anthony Babington at its head, was discovered by\r\nWalsingham. The delight of the citizens at the queen's escape drew forth\r\nfrom her a letter which she desired to be read before the Common Council,\r\nand in which she testified her appreciation of their loyalty. The letter\r\nwas introduced to the council by some prefatory remarks made by James\r\nDalton, a member of the court, in which he expatiated upon the beauties of\r\nthe reformed Church as contrasted with the Roman religion.(1650) The\r\ndiscovery of the plot led to stringent measures being taken against\r\nsuspected persons in the city, and returns were ordered to be made setting\r\nforth for each ward: (1) the names of the ablest men for service, (2) the\r\nnames of those past service, (3) the names of all who were suspected as to\r\nreligion, and (4) the names of all strangers born.(1651)\r\n\r\n(M803)\r\n\r\nThe discovery had also another effect: it brought the head of Mary Stuart\r\nto the block. A commission of peers sitting at Fotheringhay found that the\r\nconspiracy had been \"with the privitie of the said Marie pretending tytle\r\nto the crowne of the realme of England,\" and it only remained for\r\nElizabeth to sign the warrant for her execution to remove for ever a\r\ndangerous rival. This, however, the queen long hesitated to do, and when\r\nat length prevailed upon she caused public proclamation to be made of the\r\nreasons which induced her to take the extreme course.(1652)\r\n\r\n(M804)\r\n\r\nTo add to the general gloom, England was threatened before the close of\r\nthe year (1586) with a famine, caused partly by the inclemency of the\r\nseasons and partly by a \"corner\" in wheat, which some enterprising\r\nengrossers had managed to bring about.(1653) In November the mayor caused\r\nthe city companies to lay in 6,000 or 7,000 quarters of wheat and rye for\r\nthe relief of those who had already suffered from the extreme dearth, and\r\nto raise a sum of L2,500 over and above such sums as they had hitherto\r\ndisbursed for the provision of corn and grain,(1654) and the Court of\r\nAldermen (3 Jan., 1587) agreed to erect a new garner at the\r\nBridgehouse.(1655)\r\n\r\n(M805)\r\n\r\nAfter the execution of Mary Stuart, Philip of Spain laid claim to the\r\ncrown of England. For years past he was known to have been preparing a\r\nfleet for an invasion of the country. Preparations were now almost\r\ncomplete, and in 1587 expectation was that the fleet might be seen any day\r\nbearing down upon the English coast. The inhabitants of villages and towns\r\non the south coast forsook their homes in terror of the invasion and\r\nsought shelter inland.(1656) The evil hour was put off by the prompt\r\naction of Drake, who, with four ships of the royal navy and twenty-four\r\nothers supplied by the City and private individuals,(1657) appeared\r\nsuddenly off the Spanish coast, and running into Cadiz and Lisbon,\r\ndestroyed tons of shipping under the very nose of the Spanish lord high\r\nadmiral, and threw into the sea the vast military stores that had been\r\naccumulated there. Having thus accomplished the object for which he set\r\nsail--that of \"singeing the king of Spain's beard\"--he returned, and the\r\nsailing of the Armada was put off for a year.\r\n\r\n(M806)\r\n\r\nPreparations were in the meanwhile pushed on in the city to meet the\r\nattack whenever it should be made. Ten thousand men were levied and\r\nequipped in a short space of time.(1658) Any inhabitant of the city\r\nassessed in the subsidy-book at L50 in goods, and who, being under fifty\r\nyears of age, was called upon to serve, and refused, was forthwith\r\ncommitted to Newgate.(1659) If any fault was to be found with the city's\r\nforce it was the inefficiency of its officers, whom the municipal\r\nauthorities always claimed to appoint. The Earl of Leicester, who was in\r\ncommand of the camp which had been formed at Tilbury, held but a poor\r\nopinion of Londoners as a fighting force.(1660) \"For your Londoners,\"\r\nwrote the earl to Walsingham,(1661) I see their service will be little,\r\nexcept they have their own captains, and having them, I look for none at\r\nall by them when we shall meet the enemy.\" He declares that he knows what\r\nburghers be well enough, even though they be \"as brave and well trained\"\r\nas the Londoners; they would be useless without good leaders,(1662) and on\r\nthis he had always insisted. He warns Walsingham against yielding to the\r\nwishes of \"townsmen\" at such a critical juncture, for they would look for\r\nthe like concession at other times. The Londoners were not peculiar in\r\ntheir desire to have their own officers, according to the earl's own\r\nshowing, for the letter continues:--\"You and my lords all know the\r\nimperfection at this time, how few leaders you have, and the gentlemen of\r\nthe counties here are likewise very loth to have any placed with them to\r\ncommand under them, but well pleased to have some expert man with them to\r\ngive them advice.\" Two years later a code of regulations for the\r\n\"trayninge of capytaynes\" was forwarded by the government to the city, and\r\nthere put into execution.(1663)\r\n\r\n(M807)\r\n\r\nIn addition to the land force the City agreed (3 April, 1588) to furnish\r\nand fully equip for war sixteen of the largest and best merchant ships\r\nthat could be found in the Thames, and four pinnaces to attend on\r\nthem.(1664) A committee was nominated to sit at Clothworkers' Hall and\r\ntake the necessary steps for fitting out the vessels, the cost of which\r\nwas to be met by an assessment on citizen and stranger alike.(1665)\r\nNothing was said at the time about victualling the fleet, but we learn\r\nfrom a later entry in the City's Journal that they were victualled for\r\nthree months. On the 16th July the City agreed to supply victuals for\r\n\"those twentie shipps lately sett forth\" for one month longer, and on the\r\n10th August the Common Council again passed a similar resolution.(1666)\r\n\r\n(M808)\r\n\r\nAt last the blow fell. On Friday, the 19th (o.s.) July, the Armada was\r\nsighted off the Lizard. A strong wind from the south-west was blowing at\r\nthe time, and it was thought advisable to let the fleet pass and to follow\r\nit up with the English vessels then lying in Plymouth harbour. On the\r\nfollowing day the two fleets hove in sight of each other. According to the\r\nreport made to Walsingham by Richard Tomson--a Londoner serving on board\r\nthe _Margaret and John_, one of the ships furnished by the City--the\r\nSpanish fleet numbered at that time 136 sail, ninety of which were large\r\nvessels, whilst the English fleet numbered no more than sixty-seven.(1667)\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the great superiority of the enemy's fleet in numbers and\r\ntonnage, the English admiral, Lord Howard, opened fire the next morning,\r\nbut took care not to come to close quarters. \"We had some small fight with\r\nthem that Sunday afternoon,\" reported Hawkins to Walsingham.(1668) The\r\nadmiral had other reasons for preserving caution. His ships were but\r\nill-furnished with provisions and with ammunition, and even thus early he\r\nhad to beg the Secretary of State to send him \"for God's sake some powder\r\nand shot.\"(1669) The same deficiency of ammunition was experienced the\r\nwhole time that the two fleets were opposed to each other, and but for\r\nthis the enemy would not have got off so cheaply as it did. Scarcely a day\r\npassed without some cannonading taking place, but never a general\r\nengagement. The English trusted to their superior seamanship and to the\r\ngreater activity of their own light vessels compared with the heavier and\r\nmore unwieldly Spanish galleons. Again and again they poured broadside\r\nafter broadside into the enemy, but always making good their retreat\r\nbefore the Spanish vessels could turn in pursuit. On Tuesday (23 July),\r\nwrote Hawkins, they had \"a sharp and long fight\" off Portland, on Thursday\r\n\"a hot fraye.\" And thus the Armada made its way up channel, pestered with\r\nthe swarm of English vessels that would never leave it at peace. On the\r\nSaturday following (27 July) it finally dropped anchor in Calais roads,\r\nwith the intention of awaiting there the arrival of Alexander Farnese with\r\nhis promised aid before making a direct descent upon the English coast.\r\nFarnese did not arrive for the reason that he was blockaded by the Dutch\r\nfleet; but the English received an accession of strength by the arrival of\r\nLord Henry Seymour with a squadron of sixteen ships, which hitherto had\r\nbeen lying off Folkestone.(1670)\r\n\r\nAt this juncture the lord mayor (Sir George Bond), having received\r\ninformation of the critical state of affairs and that a general engagement\r\nwas imminent, issued his precept to the aldermen to summon the pastors and\r\nministers of each ward, and bid them call their parishioners to church by\r\ntoll of bell or otherwise, both in the morning and afternoon of this\r\neventful Saturday, in order that humble and hearty prayers might be\r\noffered to Almighty God \"by preaching and otherwise,\" as the necessity of\r\nthe times required.(1671) Three days before (24 July) he had given orders\r\nfor a strict watch and ward to be kept in the city, and for a goodly\r\nsupply of leather buckets in case of fire.(1672)\r\n\r\n(M809)\r\n\r\nAfter more than one consultation together, the English commanders\r\ndetermined to resort to stratagem. They sent for a number of useless hulks\r\nfrom Dover, and having filled them with every kind of combustible, sent\r\nthem all aflame on Sunday night into the thick of the enemy. The result\r\nwas a panic; cables were cut and frantic attempts made to escape what\r\nseemed imminent and wholesale destruction. The ships fell foul of each\r\nother; some were wrecked and others burnt. When Monday morning dawned only\r\neighty-six vessels out of 124 that had anchored off Calais thirty-six\r\nhours before could be found, and these for the most part were seen driving\r\ntowards the coast of Flanders. The English fleet at once prepared to\r\nfollow in pursuit, but attention was for a time drawn off to the action of\r\nthe flagship of the squadron of galeasses, a huge vessel which had become\r\ndisabled by loss of rudder, and the crew of which were endeavouring by the\r\naid of oars to bring into Calais harbour. The Lord Admiral Howard at once\r\nbore down upon her in the _Ark_, but the water proved too shallow. The\r\nLondon ship _Margaret and John_ followed suit and, although of less\r\ntonnage than the _Ark_, got aground. Richard Tomson sent home a graphic\r\naccount of the exploit that followed.(1673) Both ships sent out long boats\r\nto capture the rich prize as she lay stuck fast upon the harbour bar.\r\nTomson himself formed one of the little band of volunteers. The boats were\r\nsoon alongside the galeass, its huge sides towering high above them. There\r\nthen ensued \"a pretty skirmish for half-an-hour,\" wrote Tomson, \"but they\r\nseemed safely ensconced in their ships, while we in our open pinnaces and\r\nfar under them had nothing to shroud and cover us.\" Fortune at last\r\nfavoured the attackers. The Spanish commander fell dead on his deck with a\r\nbullet through his head. A panic seized the sailors, most of whom jumped\r\noverboard and tried by swimming and wading to reach the shore. Some\r\nsucceeded, but many were drowned; whilst those who remained on board\r\nsignified their readiness to capitulate by hoisting a couple of\r\n\"handkerchers\" on rapiers. The English lost no time in clambering up the\r\nsides of the monster, and at once commenced plundering the vessel and\r\nreleasing the galley slaves. They were only waiting for the tide to take\r\ntheir prize in tow and carry her off when they were warned by the governor\r\nof Calais against making any such attempt. They were free to plunder the\r\nvessel if they liked, but make prize of the vessel itself they must not,\r\nand this order the governor showed himself ready and able to enforce by\r\nopening fire from the fort. Tomson and his fellow volunteers were heartily\r\ndisgusted at having after all to surrender their prize, \"the verye glory\r\nand staye of the Spanish armye, a thing of very great value and strength.\"\r\n\r\n(M810)\r\n\r\nThis exploit being ended and the long boats having returned to their\r\nrespective ships, the lord admiral started in pursuit of the Spaniards.\r\nSeeing them coming up the Spanish commander immediately prepared for\r\naction. An engagement--described by Hawkins as \"a long and great\r\nfight\"--took place off Gravelines and lasted six hours. The English pursued\r\nthe same tactics as before, and with like success. Without losing a single\r\nship of their own they succeeded in riddling the best Spanish ships\r\nthrough and through, and at last the Armada was forced to bear away\r\ntowards the open sea. The English followed and made a pretence of keeping\r\nup the attack, but by this time nearly all their ammunition as well as\r\nfood had given out.\r\n\r\n(M811)\r\n\r\nFrom Tuesday (30 July) until the following Friday (2 Aug.) the pursuit\r\nwas, nevertheless, maintained by Howard, Drake and Frobisher. On Sunday (4\r\nAug.) the strong south-wester which had prevailed rose to a gale, and the\r\nEnglish fleet made its way home with difficulty. It was otherwise with the\r\nArmada. Crippled and forlorn, without pilots and without competent\r\ncommander, the great fleet was driven northward past the Hebrides and\r\neventually returned home in a decimated condition by the west coast of\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\n(M812)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the civic authorities took order for receiving the sick\r\nand wounded and administering to their comfort. Two aldermen--Sir Thomas\r\nPullison and Sir Wolstan Dixie--were deputed (29 July) by their brethren to\r\nride abroad among the innholders, brewers, bakers and butchers of the city\r\nto see that they did not enhance the price of provisions and that they\r\nwell entertained all soldiers who arrived in the city.(1674) The City\r\nagreed, moreover, to re-victual the ships it had furnished and to provide\r\nthem with munition and other requisites. A fresh tax was imposed for the\r\npurpose of \"marine and land affairs.\"(1675)\r\n\r\n(M813)\r\n\r\nIt was a long time before any certain news arrived in the city of the\r\nultimate fate of the Armada. There had been rumours abroad that the\r\nEnglish fleet had been victorious--with so many Londoners serving in the\r\nfleet, it would have been strange indeed if their friends at home had been\r\nkept in absolute ignorance of what was taking place in the channel--and\r\nbonfires had been lighted, but these rumours were often incorrect and\r\nsometimes lead to mischief. The mayor therefore issued his precept to the\r\naldermen on the 30th July--the day after the engagement off\r\nGravelines--bidding them see that the inhabitants of their several wards\r\nrefrained from crediting any news that might be reported of the vessels at\r\nsea but what they received from the mayor himself. The precaution was\r\nnecessary \"for the avoyding of some dislike that may come thereof.\"(1676)\r\nOn the 1st August, so critical were the times, the mayor issued a precept\r\nby the queen's orders forbidding householders to quit the city, that they\r\nmight the better be ready for the queen's service if required.(1677) On\r\nthe 4th the citizens were informed that if they had any friend or servant\r\ndetained as prisoner in the Spanish dominion, or bound to the galleys,\r\nwhom they wished to set free, they might have Spanish prisoners allotted\r\nto them to assist towards ransom.(1678)\r\n\r\n(M814)\r\n\r\nThe first public notification of the complete destruction of the Armada\r\nwas made in a thanksgiving sermon preached by the Dean of St. Paul's on\r\nTuesday, the 20th August, at Paul's Cross, in the presence of the mayor\r\nand aldermen and the livery companies in their best gowns.(1679) In\r\nNovember the queen resolved to attend a public thanksgiving service at St.\r\nPaul's in person, Monday, the 18th, being the day that was originally\r\nfixed. Great preparations were made for the occasion. The livery companies\r\nwere ordered to take up their appointed stations at eight o'clock in the\r\nmorning and to follow in the train of the royal procession until the\r\n\"preaching place\" was reached. Places were to be kept by a detachment of\r\nthe \"yeomanry\" of each company sent on at six o'clock for that purpose.\r\nThe \"governors of the hospital\" of each company were also to attend, staff\r\nin hand, and repair to the \"skaffold\" for them appointed. After dinner the\r\ncompanies were to return immediately to their stations and to wait there\r\nuntil her majesty returned to Somerset House.(1680) The day was afterwards\r\nchanged from Monday, the 18th, to Sunday, the 24th, when the queen came in\r\ngreat state to St. Paul's. After prayers she took her seat in a closet\r\nbuilt out of the north wall of the church and facing Paul's Cross, where\r\nshe heard a sermon preached by the Bishop of Salisbury. That being over\r\nshe was entertained at dinner in the bishop's palace, and afterwards\r\nreturned to Somerset House.(1681)\r\n\r\n(M815)\r\n\r\nWhilst the City is justly proud of its own share in the defence of the\r\nkingdom at this great crisis in the nation's history, it has not neglected\r\nto give honour where honour was most due. Of the great naval commanders\r\nthe \"sea dogs\" of that age--the faces of at least two of them were familiar\r\nto the citizens. Both Frobisher and Hawkins owned property in the city,\r\nand in all probability resided there, like their fellow seaman and\r\nexplorer, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, who was living in Red Cross Street, in the\r\nparish of St. Giles, Cripplegate, in 1583, the year that he met his death\r\nat sea.(1682) The same parish claims Frobisher, whose remains (excepting\r\nhis entrails, which were interred at Plymouth, where he died) lie buried\r\nin St. Giles's Church, and to whom a mural monument was erected by the\r\nvestry in 1888, just three centuries after the defeat of the Armada, to\r\nwhich he had contributed so much. If Hawkins himself did not reside in the\r\ncity, his widow had a mansion house in Mincing Lane.(1683) He, too, had\r\nprobably lived there, for although he died and was buried at sea, a\r\nmonument was erected to his memory and that of Katherine, his first wife,\r\nin the church of St. Dunstan-in-the-East.(1684) There is one other--a\r\ncitizen of London and son of an alderman--whose name has been handed down\r\nas having taken an active part in the defence of the kingdom at this time,\r\nnot at sea, but on land. A monument in the recently restored church of St.\r\nHelen, Bishopsgate, tells us that Martin Bond, son of Alderman William\r\nBond, \"was captaine in ye yeare 1588 at ye campe at Tilbury, and after\r\nremained chief captaine of ye trained bands of this citty until his\r\ndeath.\" The monument represents him as sitting in a tent guarded by two\r\nsentinels, with a page holding a horse.\r\n\r\n(M816)\r\n\r\nIt was well that the Spaniards suffered defeat at sea, for had they been\r\nable to effect a landing they would have made short work with the\r\nhalf-trained and dissatisfied soldiers in the camp at Tilbury, and London\r\nwould have been at their mercy. Even the presence of Elizabeth herself,\r\nriding on horseback through the camp, as she did on the 8th August, was\r\nbut poor compensation to the soldiers for the want of victuals and wages.\r\nMany sold their armour and weapons to pay themselves as soon as the camp\r\nbroke up. Citizens of London were warned by royal proclamation (20\r\nAug.)(1685) against purchasing armour and weapons offered by soldiers, who\r\nwere declared to \"have most falsly and slanderously given out that they\r\nweare compelled to make sale of them for that they receaved noe pay, which\r\nis most untruely reported.\" Any armour or weapons bought before\r\npublication of the proclamation was to be delivered up to the mayor with\r\nparticulars as to the way the purchase had been effected and compensation\r\nwould be allowed.\r\n\r\n(M817)\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the extreme parsimony with which Elizabeth had fitted out\r\nboth army and navy, the cost of preparations to meet the attack of Spain\r\nhad been great, and she was obliged to borrow money. In September (1588)\r\nthe City advanced her the sum of L30,000, receiving her bond for repayment\r\nin the following March; and in the following December she borrowed a\r\nfurther sum of L20,000 to be repaid by the following April. Both sums were\r\nraised among the livery companies.(1686)\r\n\r\n(M818)\r\n\r\nIn March of the following year (1589) parliament granted a liberal supply,\r\nbut the grant was accompanied by a request that Elizabeth would no longer\r\nawait the assaults of Spain, but carry the war into the enemy's country.\r\nThis the queen declared her inability to undertake on the score of\r\npoverty. She promised, however, to give what assistance she could to any\r\nof her subjects who relished such enterprise. Norris and Drake were at\r\nhand, ready and willing to undertake the work on these terms. Already (in\r\nJanuary) the City had been called upon to furnish them with 400 strong and\r\nable men.(1687) At the end of March 1,000 more were required, and each\r\nalderman was instructed to search in his ward for all able and masterless\r\nmen and all other persons fit for service that were householders and not\r\ncharged with families, and to bring them to the Leadenhall.(1688) With\r\nthese and other forces the expedition set sail, but beyond storming Vigo\r\nand committing some damage at Corunna, it accomplished nothing and\r\nreturned in July.\r\n\r\n(M819)\r\n\r\nAgain the city was threatened with danger and disease from the presence of\r\ndisbanded soldiers and sailors, who were apt to carry their freebooting\r\nhabits wherever they went, more especially when starvation stared them in\r\nthe face. Sir Martin Calthorp did what he could to relieve them, paying\r\nout of his own pocket no less a sum than L100. His conduct was applauded\r\nby the lords of the council, who authorised him to raise a further sum\r\ntowards assisting the soldiers to their homes in the country by allowing\r\nthem a half-penny a mile.(1689)\r\n\r\n(M820)\r\n\r\nA royal proclamation was subsequently (20 Aug.) issued promising payment\r\nof any money due to mariners who would make a written application to the\r\nAdmiralty. Soldiers were to return to the country where they had been\r\npressed and apply to the justices or other officers who pressed them, and\r\nwho would make a certificate to the lieutenant of the county, when the\r\nsoldiers would receive \"reasonable contentment.\"(1690) This, however,\r\nfailed entirely to remedy the evil.(1691) Four days before this\r\nproclamation precept had been issued to the aldermen for a good and\r\nsubstantial double watch to be kept throughout the night of the 16th\r\nAugust until noon of the next day. There had been a report abroad of a\r\nlarge meeting of soldiers and sailors to take place as early as five\r\no'clock on the morning of the 17th in the neighbourhood of Tower\r\nHill.(1692)\r\n\r\n(M821)\r\n\r\nThe revolution which followed the assassination of the French king by\r\nJaques Clements about this time (Aug., 1589) brought fresh anxiety to\r\nElizabeth, who felt bound to support the Protestant Henry of Navarre with\r\nall the means at her command, as an indirect way of carrying on the war\r\nagainst Spain. Four thousand men were to be despatched for his assistance,\r\n1,000 of whom the City was called upon to supply. As they were to be\r\npicked men the lords of the council ordered double the number, or 2,000\r\nmen, to be got ready, in order that expert officers might review them and\r\nselect the number required.(1693) The demand was enforced by a letter from\r\nthe queen herself, in which she drew attention to the necessity of\r\nassisting one whose preservation was of so much importance to\r\nEngland.(1694) The city's gates were at once closed by the mayor's orders\r\nto prevent the exodus of \"lusty, strong, able and young men\" to avoid\r\nservice.(1695) Although Henry IV was materially assisted by the arrival of\r\nEnglish troops, their operations were chiefly confined to Normandy.\r\n\r\n(M822)\r\n\r\nA further contingent of 400 men was shortly afterwards (22 June) demanded\r\nby the queen, 300 of which were to be got ready at once. More care than\r\nusual was to be bestowed on their selection, as they were to be employed\r\nunder the Earl of Essex,(1696) with whom the City happened at this time to\r\nbe out of favour. What was the precise cause of the City's disgrace does\r\nnot appear; we only know that the civic authorities were anxious to\r\nrecover the good will of one so near the person of the sovereign, and to\r\nthis end made him a \"small present,\" thanking him for his past services,\r\nfor the general defence of the realm, and of all Christian estates\r\nprofessing the Gospel and true religion of Almighty God, and assuring him\r\nthat they were not so much presenting him with money, in sending him a\r\ngratuity, as with \"the hart of the citie.\" They begged that if some\r\nprivate offence had been given to his lordship he would \"wrappe it up\" in\r\nthis public testimony of their hearty good wills.(1697)\r\n\r\n(M823)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Common Council had, at the queen's request, agreed (16\r\nJune) to fit out six ships of war and one pinnace at a cost of L7,400, to\r\nbe levied on the companies. This sum was afterwards raised to\r\nL8,000.(1698) Towards the close of the year (9 Nov.) the lord mayor and\r\nsheriffs were called upon to levy 200 able men to be \"pioners.\" They were\r\nto be chosen out of the city of London and the county of Middlesex, and to\r\nbe despatched to Dieppe for service under the Earl of Essex \"a service\r\nvearie necessarie and we hope not of any long continuaunce,\"(1699) wrote\r\nthe queen. In addition to men, the queen wanted money; and the Common\r\nCouncil agreed (18 Sept.) to lend her L20,000 for three months, afterwards\r\nrenewed for six months.(1700)\r\n\r\n(M824)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Spanish emissaries, disguised as soldiers, mariners,\r\nmerchants, gentlemen with comely apparel, and even as \"gallantes,\" decked\r\nout in colours and feathers, had been doing the work of Philip silently\r\nbut surely. Some had resorted to the Universities; some to the Inns of\r\nCourt; whilst others had insinuated themselves into private families; but\r\nwherever they took up their abode, and in whatsoever capacity, their one\r\naim and object had been to seduce the queen's subjects from their\r\nallegiance. So successful had been their efforts that Philip meditated\r\nanother attack on England in 1592. At length commissioners were appointed\r\nin all parts of the country to search for these \"venemous vipers.\"\r\nHouseholders were at the same time directed to enquire into the\r\nantecedents of those who lodged with them, and to mark if they attended\r\nDivine Service or not. A register or calendar of particulars respecting\r\nthem was to be kept, to be shown on demand.(1701) Here is a description of\r\none whose arrest was desired in 1596:--\"A yonge man of meane and slender\r\nstature aged about xxvjtie wth a high collored face, red nose, a warte\r\nover his left eye, havinge two greate teeth before standinge out very\r\napparant, he nameth himselffe Edward Harrison borne in Westmerland,\r\napparelled in a crane collored fustian dublet, rounde hose, after the\r\nfrenche facion, an olde paire of yollowe knit neather stockes, he escaped\r\nwthout either cloake, girdle, garters or shoes.\"(1702)\r\n\r\n(M825)\r\n\r\nWhilst all exportation of munitions of war, corn and other victual into\r\nSpain or Portugal was strictly forbidden,(1703) the merchants of London,\r\nas well as noblemen and wealthy country gentlemen, were encouraged to deal\r\nblows at the enemy by fitting out privateers for scouring the Spanish\r\nMain.(1704) Many a rich prize was thus brought home, the spoil being\r\ndivided by specially appointed commissioners,(1705) whose duty it was,\r\namong other things, to see that the Crown was not defrauded of the custom\r\ndue upon the goods thus captured.\"(1706) The \"fleet of the city of London\"\r\nwas very successful in this kind of work, and a sum of L6,000 fell to its\r\nlot as prize-money in 1591. This sum was ventured again in an expedition\r\nundertaken by Raleigh in the following year,(1707) with the result that\r\nthe City netted no less a sum than L12,000, its share of the spoil of a\r\nrich \"carraque\" that Raleigh had captured.(1708)\r\n\r\n(M826)\r\n\r\nThis lucky windfall befell the citizens at a time when money was sorely\r\nneeded for building a pest-house or hospital for sufferers from the\r\nplague, which again visited the city at the close of 1592.(1709) The cost\r\nof such a building was estimated at L6,000. Various schemes were proposed\r\nfor raising the money. At one time (July, 1593) it was resolved that the\r\nseveral livery companies which had taken shares in Raleigh's venture\r\nshould contribute twelvepence in the pound of their clear gain towards the\r\nobject.(1710) Later on (May, 1594) the companies were called upon to\r\ncontribute one-third of their clear gain. Even this proved insufficient,\r\nand had to be supplemented by a \"benevolence\" in each ward.(1711) Another\r\nyear went by, and the hospital was still unfinished.(1712)\r\n\r\n(M827)\r\n\r\nThe strain which the continuation of the war and the threatened renewal of\r\na Spanish invasion imposed upon the inhabitants of London at large was a\r\ngreat one, and appears to have affected the mind of a weak and hysterical\r\nwoman, Anne Burnell. She gave out that she was a daughter of the king of\r\nSpain, and that the arms of England and Spain were to be seen, like\r\n_stigmata_, upon her back, as was vouched for by her servant Alice Digges.\r\nAfter medical examination, which proved her statement to be \"false and\r\nproceedinge of some lewde and imposterouse pretence,\" she and her maid\r\nwere ordered to be whipt,--\"ther backes only beeinge layd bare,\"--at the\r\ncart's tail through the city on a market day, \"with a note in writinge\r\nuppon the hinder part of there heades shewinge the cawse of there saide\r\npunishmente.\"(1713)\r\n\r\n(M828)\r\n\r\nOn the 16th July, 1594, the queen informed the citizens by letter of the\r\nking of Spain having made preparations to get possession of the harbour of\r\nBrest, and her determination to oppose him. She had given orders for\r\ncertain companies of soldiers to be levied in divers counties, and she\r\ncalled upon the citizens to furnish her with a contingent of 450 men. They\r\nwere to be well trained and supplied with armour and weapons; their \"coate\r\nand conduct monye\" would be found for them.(1714) The Court of Common\r\nCouncil met on the following day and agreed to provide the number of\r\nsoldiers required.(1715) It had already (15 July) agreed to furnish six\r\nships and two pinnaces for her majesty's service,(1716) which William\r\nGarraway and other owners of ships contracted to find for the sum of\r\nL5,000.(1717)\r\n\r\n(M829)\r\n\r\nOn Michaelmas-day (1594) John Spencer--\"Rich Spencer\" as he was called,\r\nfrom his extraordinary wealth--was elected mayor for the ensuing\r\nyear.(1718) His daughter, much against her father's will, married Lord\r\nCompton. To thwart the matrimonial designs of a nobleman was in those days\r\na perilous task, and Alderman Spencer was committed to the Fleet \"for a\r\ncontempt\" in endeavouring to conceal his daughter. \"Our Sir John Spencer,\r\nof London\"--writes John Chamberlain(1719) to Dudley Carleton (15 March,\r\n1599)--\"was the last weeke committed to the Fleet for a contempt and hiding\r\naway his daughter, who, they say, is contracted to the Lord Compton; but\r\nnow he is out again, and by all meanes seekes to hinder the match,\r\nalledging a precontract to Sir Arthur Henningham's sonne. But upon his\r\nbeating and misusing her she was sequestred to one Barkers, a proctor, and\r\nfrom thence to Sir Henry Billingsleyes,(1720) where she yet remaines till\r\nthe matter be tried. If the obstinate and self-willed fellow shold persist\r\nin his doggednes (as he protests he will) and geve her nothing, the poore\r\nlord shold have a warme catch.\"\r\n\r\nA few weeks after Spencer's confinement in the Fleet we find him at\r\nvariance with his brother aldermen for digging a pit on his estate near\r\n\"Canbury,\" or Canonbury, and thereby drawing off water which should have\r\ngone to supply the poor of St. Bartholomew's Hospital to his own mansion.\r\nA request was sent to him by the mayor and Court of Aldermen to cease the\r\nconveyance of water until further order had been taken therein.(1721) Two\r\nyears later his \"doggednes\" once more got him into trouble, and he was\r\ncommitted to Wood Street Compter for refusing to pay certain small sums of\r\nmoney due from him towards furnishing soldiers and armour.(1722) He died\r\nthe 30th March, 1609, leaving behind him L80,000.\r\n\r\nHis daughter, who inherited her father's money, was possessed also of some\r\nof her father's spirit, and Lord Compton appears to have got \"a warme\r\ncatch\" indeed to judge from a letter she addressed to him soon after her\r\nfather's death. After reminding her \"sweete life\" of the care she had ever\r\ntaken of his estate and of her excellent behaviour, she begs him to allow\r\nher L1,600 per annum, to be paid quarterly, besides L600 a year for\r\ncharitable works. She will have three horses for her own saddle \"that none\r\nshall dare to lend or borrow; none lend but I, none borrow but you.\" She\r\nwill have so many gentlemen and so many gentlewomen to wait upon her at\r\nhome, whilst riding, hunting, hawking or travelling. When on the road she\r\nwill have laundresses \"sent away with the carriages to see all safe,\" and\r\nchambermaids sent before with the grooms that the chambers may be ready,\r\nsweet and clean. Seeing that her requests are so reasonable she expects\r\nher husband to find her children in apparel and schooling, and all her\r\nservants in wages. She concludes by declaring her will to have her houses\r\nhandsomely furnished, not omitting \"silver warming pans,\" warns her\r\nhusband against lending money to the lord chamberlain, and prays him to\r\nincrease her allowance and double her attendance on his becoming an\r\nearl.(1723)\r\n\r\n(M830)\r\n\r\nSpencer was succeeded in the mayoralty by Sir Stephen Slaney, and the\r\nlatter's year of office proved a busy one. Spain was meditating another\r\ndescent on England \"with a greate navy of shippes by sea and huge powers\r\nof men by lande,\" and the City was expected to furnish sixteen ships and\r\n10,000 men for land service. The naval demand was extravagant, and after\r\nsome remonstrance was reduced to one for twelve ships and two pinnaces,\r\nwith a complement of 1,200 men.(1724) The City made an attempt to get a\r\nreduction made also in the land force, but with what success is not clear.\r\nThis was in December, 1595. The money was found by imposing a tax of 2_s._\r\n8_d._ in the pound for goods and 4_s._ in the pound for lands on every\r\ninhabitant of the city,(1725) and by advances made by the livery\r\ncompanies.(1726) On the 8th January (1596) the queen addressed a very\r\ngracious letter of thanks to the City for the promptitude displayed in\r\nfurnishing the ships.(1727) Instead of waiting for Spain to attack,\r\nElizabeth carried the war into the enemy's country, and Cadiz was captured\r\nsix months later by Essex and Howard. This exploit, in which the city of\r\nLondon took its share, has been described(1728) as the most brilliant that\r\nhad ever been achieved by English arms between Agincourt and Blenheim, and\r\nit was celebrated in London with bonfires and general rejoicing.(1729) As\r\nsoon as the Common Council heard of the arrival of the fleet from its\r\nsuccessful voyage it despatched commissioners to see after the City's\r\nshare of prize money.(1730)\r\n\r\n(M831)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime (April, 1596) the queen's tortuous and parsimonious policy\r\nhad led to Calais falling into the hands of Spain. She had called upon the\r\nLondoners to furnish 1,000 soldiers to assist in raising the siege, but it\r\nis a question whether they ever got beyond Dover.(1731) Roused for the\r\ntime to a more energetic line of action, she determined to prevent, if\r\npossible, the sister town of Boulogne falling into the hands of Spain, and\r\nshe called upon the city of London to supply 405 men towards the force to\r\nbe despatched in the autumn for its defence.(1732)\r\n\r\n(M832)\r\n\r\nThe necessity of recruiting the garrison of the cautionary town of\r\nFlushing, from which troops had recently been withdrawn for service on the\r\nhigh seas, compelled the queen to apply again to the City (July, 1596) for\r\na contingent of 200 men.(1733)\r\n\r\n(M833)\r\n\r\nThis constant drain on the resources of the city at length called forth a\r\nremonstrance. The city was being threatened with famine at the close of\r\nthe year (1596), when another demand arrived for ten ships to be fitted\r\nout for the public service. The matter was referred to a committee, and a\r\nreply was drawn up, which was practically a refusal to obey the commands\r\nof the council.(1734)\r\n\r\n(M834)\r\n\r\nIt set forth the utter inability of the citizens, however willing they\r\nmight be, to supply more ships. They had already expended on sea service\r\nalone, and irrespective of their disbursements in 1588, no less a sum than\r\n100,000 marks within the last few years; so that the lords of the council\r\nwould see that the citizens had not been wanting in good will and\r\naffection towards] that service. The same good will still remained, but\r\nthere was lacking the like ability, owing partly to former charges by sea\r\nand land, but more especially to the great scarcity of victual which had\r\ncontinued in the city for the past three years, and had compelled many who\r\nhad formerly been well off to reduce their expenditure, whilst others had\r\nbeen obliged to relinquish their trades and break up their households. As\r\na proof of the poverty existing in the city their lordships were reminded\r\nthat when wheat was offered at a very moderate rate many were too poor to\r\npurchase any. The wealthier sort would therefore have to be called upon to\r\nsubscribe towards the maintenance of the poorer class, and so be rendered\r\nless able to contribute to other demands. The letter proceeded to draw\r\ntheir lordships' attention to what after all was the reason which weighed\r\nmost with the citizens for refusing to contribute any more to the naval\r\nservice. \"Besides theis defectes\" wrote the mayor and corporation \"we may\r\nnot conceale the great discontentment and utter discouragement of the\r\ncommon people wthin this citie touchinge their adventure in the late viage\r\nto the towne at _Cales_ [Cadiz] wch albeit it was perfourmed wth soe great\r\nhonor and happy successe as that the enemye was greatly weakned, the army\r\nenritched and such store of treasure and other comodities (besides that\r\nwch was thear embeazelled) brought safe home as was sufficient to defraye\r\nthe charges of the whole voyage, yet forasmuch as neither their principall\r\nnor any parte thereof was restored unto them contrarie to the meaninge of\r\nthe contract set downe in writinge under the signatures of two noble\r\npersons in her highnes name, they are made hereby utterly unfitt and\r\nindisposed for the like service to be done hereafter.\"(1735) The Cadiz\r\nadventure--they went on to say--had cost the City L1,900, a great part of\r\nwhich sum was still not collected, whilst the City's Chamber was already\r\nin debt to the extent of L14,000 and utterly unable to afford relief. The\r\nwriters, in conclusion, expressed themselves ready to contribute towards\r\nthe defence of the whole realm in like proportion as others of her\r\nmajesty's subjects, and with this arrangement they felt sure her majesty\r\nwould be well content.\r\n\r\nWhat was the effect of this reply does not appear; but in one respect the\r\nqueen was more than a match for the citizens. They had pleaded scarcity of\r\nprovisions and poverty as an excuse for not carrying out her recent\r\norders. Very good; let the livery companies, whose duty it was to find men\r\nand money when required, practise a little self-restraint in the coming\r\nsummer (1597). Let them, she said, forbear giving feasts in their halls\r\nand elsewhere, and bestow half the money thus saved on the poor; and the\r\norder of the Court of Aldermen went forth accordingly.(1736)\r\n\r\n(M835)\r\n\r\nFor some years past it had always been feared lest Spain should again\r\nendeavour to strike at England through Ireland. A rising in Ulster under\r\nHugh O'Neill, known in England as the Earl of Tyrone, in 1594 was followed\r\nby an appeal to Spain for help in 1595. Philip acceded to the request and\r\nanother Armada was got ready; but the fleet had scarcely put to sea before\r\nit suffered a similar fate to the Armada of 1588 and was shattered by a\r\nstorm (Dec., 1596). The Tyrone rebellion necessitated further calls on the\r\nCity for men and money. In May, 1597, it was asked to furnish 500 men,\r\nsuch as Sir Samuel Bagnall might approve of.(1737) In the following\r\nyear--when Bagnall met with a crushing defeat on the Blackwater--it was\r\ncalled upon to supply a further contingent of 300 men and to lend the\r\nqueen a sum of L20,000.(1738) In 1599 Elizabeth sent her favourite Essex\r\nto conquer Ireland in good earnest, to prevent the country falling into\r\nthe hands of Spain. She at the same time called upon the City for more\r\nsoldiers, and borrowed another sum of L60,000 on mortgage.(1739)\r\n\r\n(M836)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime a report again got abroad that a Spanish fleet was\r\nassembling at Brest for a descent on England. On the 25th July, 1598, the\r\nlords of the council wrote to the mayor calling upon him to see that some\r\ntwelve or sixteen vessels were provided with ordnance and powder for the\r\ndefence of the Thames, and the court of Common Council at once took the\r\nnecessary steps for fitting out the ships as well as for mustering a force\r\nof 3,000 men, afterwards raised to 6,000.(1740) The city's forces and the\r\ncharge of the river were confided to the Earl of Cumberland. Sir Thomas\r\nGerrard had at first been appointed colonel of the Londoners, \"but for an\r\nold grudge since the last parliament they wold none of him.\"(1741) It was\r\nproposed to throw a bridge of boats across the Thames near Gravesend,\r\nafter the fashion of Parma's famous bridge erected across the Scheldt in\r\n1585, and the court of Common Council (4 Aug.) gave orders for collecting\r\n\"hoyes, barges, lighters, boardes, cordes\" and other material necessary\r\nfor the purpose.(1742) This project was, however, abandoned in favour of\r\nsinking hulks in the channel of the river if occasion should arise. Watch\r\nwas ordered to be strictly kept in the city night and day, lanterns to be\r\nhung out at night and the streets blocked with chains.(1743) It had been\r\nrumoured that the Spanish fleet had been descried off the Isle of Wight,\r\nand although the rumour proved false it caused no little alarm in the city\r\nand gave rise to these precautions.(1744) After a few days the supposed\r\ndanger passed away. The fleet, which had been rapidly got together, and\r\nincluded twelve ships and thirty hoys furnished by the city for the\r\ndefence of the river, put to sea nevertheless, whilst the land forces were\r\ngradually disbanded.(1745)\r\n\r\n(M837)\r\n\r\nThe administration of Essex in Ireland was a signal failure, and he made\r\nmatters worse by quitting his post without leave and forcing his presence\r\nupon the queen. He had hoped to recover her good grace by his unexpected\r\nappearance. Elizabeth was not to be thus cajoled. She ordered him into\r\ncustody, deprived him of his offices, and, what was of more importance to\r\nhim, refused to renew his patent of a monopoly of sweet wines. Although\r\nthe earl soon regained his liberty he could not forget his disgrace, and\r\nhis overweening vanity drove him to concert measures against the\r\ngovernment. In 1601 he rode at the head of a few followers into the city,\r\nexpecting the citizens to rise in his favour. The mayor had, however, been\r\nforewarned, and 1,000 men were held in readiness in each ward fully armed\r\nfor the safeguard of the city.(1746) The earl and his band proceeded to\r\nthe house of Thomas Smith, in Fenchurch Street, one of the sheriffs, who\r\nhad represented himself, or been represented by others, as able and\r\nwilling to further the earl's cause. That the sheriff was thought by his\r\nfellow citizens to have been implicated in Essex's mad attempt is seen\r\nfrom the fact that within a week he was deprived, not only of his\r\nsheriffwick, but also of his aldermanry,(1747) but to what extent he had\r\ncompromised himself it is difficult to determine. Finding the citizens\r\naverse to a rising and his passage stopped by pikemen under the command of\r\nSir John Gilbert and Sir Robert Cross, who respectively had charge of\r\nLudgate and Newgate,(1748) and who refused to surrender them except to the\r\nsheriff in person as the queen's representative, the earl and his company\r\nhastened to the riverside and returned to Essex House by water. He was\r\nsubsequently arrested and committed to the Tower, together with two of his\r\naccomplices, the Earls of Rutland and Southampton. Another of his\r\nfollowers, the Earl of Bedford, was committed for a while to the custody\r\nof Leonard Holiday, a city alderman.(1749) The queen, who had shown no\r\nmore agitation at the news of the attempt to raise the city than \"of a\r\nfray in Fleet Street,\"(1750) took an early opportunity of thanking the\r\ncitizens and her subjects generally for the loyalty they had\r\ndisplayed.(1751)\r\n\r\nA sum of L200 was distributed by the civic authorities among the officers\r\nengaged in the city's defence, but the two knights at Ludgate and Newgate\r\nrefused to accept any gratuity.(1752) For a week or more strict guard was\r\nkept at the city's gates, whilst bodies of troops fully armed were kept in\r\nreadiness at the Royal Exchange and Saint Paul's Churchyard in case of\r\ndisturbance.(1753) Essex was brought to trial on a charge of treason,\r\nconvicted and executed (25 Feb.). Sheriff Smith was made to undergo a\r\nsevere cross-examination, but appears to have got off with his life.(1754)\r\n\r\n(M838)\r\n\r\nLord Mountjoy, who had succeeded Essex in Ireland, set to work\r\nsystematically to bring the country into complete submission. The conquest\r\nwas not effected without considerable aid from the city of London. From\r\n1600 to 1602 the citizens were being constantly called upon to supply\r\nfresh forces for Ireland.(1755) A Spanish force which at length came to\r\nTyrone's assistance in 1601, and established itself at Kinsale, was\r\ncompelled to surrender. The work of the sword was supplemented by famine;\r\nuntil at last Tyrone himself was carried in triumph to Dublin, and the\r\nconquest of Ireland was complete.\r\n\r\n(M839)\r\n\r\nMountjoy's work could not be carried on without money, and Elizabeth had\r\nbeen compelled in 1601 to summon a parliament to obtain supplies. Hitherto\r\nthe Puritans, who began in the early part of the reign to gain a hold in\r\nthe House of Commons, and had gradually increased in strength, had been\r\ncontent, in the presence of a common danger, to refrain from offering any\r\nsystematic opposition to Elizabeth's government. But now that the defeat\r\nof the Armada, the death of Philip II and the firm establishment of Henry\r\nIV on the throne of France had removed all danger from abroad, they began\r\nto change front. As soon as the House met the Commons chose Croke (or\r\nCrooke), the City's Recorder, their Speaker, an honour which the City\r\nacknowledged by ordering (3 Nov.) a gift of forty marks to be made to\r\nhim.(1756) When the question of supplies came before the House they were\r\nreadily granted, but a bill was introduced to abolish patents of\r\nmonopolies, which the queen had been in the habit of lavishly bestowing\r\nupon her favourites by virtue of her prerogative, and by which the price\r\nof nearly every commodity had been grievously enhanced. It was in vain\r\nthat the minority in the House found fault with the Speaker for allowing\r\nthe queen's prerogative to be called in question. The majority had the\r\nnation at its back; and finding this to be the case Elizabeth, who knew\r\nwhen to give way, yielded with grace. When a deputation of the Commons\r\nwaited upon her and expressed the gratitude of the House at her\r\nconcession, she replied in words full of kindness and dignity, thanking\r\nthe Commons for having pointed out her error, and calling God to witness\r\nthat she had never cherished anything but what tended to her people's\r\ngood, \"Though you have had,\" she assured them, \"and may have, many princes\r\nmore mighty and wise sitting in this seat, yet you never had, or ever\r\nshall have, any that will be more careful and loving.\"\r\n\r\n(M840)\r\n\r\nThese were the last words addressed by the queen to her people, and their\r\ntruth was borne out by her conduct throughout her long reign. Under her\r\nthe country had become united and prosperous. By the citizens of London\r\nshe was especially beloved, for they always found in her a supporter of\r\ntrade and commerce. If the Hanseatic towns behaved unfairly to the\r\nmerchant adventurers Elizabeth promptly retaliated upon the merchants of\r\nthe Steelyard. She had threatened to close the Steelyard altogether in\r\n1578, when English merchants were ordered to quit Hamburg, and twenty\r\nyears later (1598), when fresh difficulties had arisen, the threat was\r\ncarried out.(1757)\r\n\r\nThe queen rarely left London to make one of her many gorgeous progresses\r\nfrom country house to country house or returned home without some notice\r\nbeing sent to the city to allow of its inhabitants taking \"the comfort of\r\nbehoulding her royall persone.\"(1758) Her love of personal admiration and\r\nof handsome men continued to the last. As late as November, 1602, she\r\ncommanded the mayor and aldermen and a number of the \"best and most grave\"\r\ncitizens to attend her from Chelsea to Westminster, and the mayor, knowing\r\nher weakness, ordered the livery companies to choose the \"most grave and\r\ncomlie\" members to join the procession.(1759) In the early morning of the\r\n24th March, 1603, she died at Richmond, to the sincere regret of the\r\ncitizens no less than of the nation at large.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL.

A fac-simile of it and of another charter of William,\r\n      granting lands to Deorman, forms a frontispiece to this volume. The\r\n      late Professor Freeman (Norman Conquest, second edition, revised\r\n      1876, iv, 29) wrote of this venerable parchment as bearing William's\r\n      mark--\"the cross traced by the Conqueror's own hand\"--but this appears\r\n      to be a mistake. The same authority, writing of the transcript of\r\n      the charter made by the late Mr. Riley and printed by him in his\r\n      edition of the _Liber Custumarum_ (Rolls Series, pt. ii, p. 504),\r\n      remarks that, \"one or two words here look a little suspicious\"; and\r\n      justly so, for the transcript is far from being literally accurate.\r\n\r\n   82 -_Cf._ \"_Ego volo quod vos sitis omni lege illa digni qua fuistis\r\n      Edwardi diebus Regis._\" These words appear in the xivth century\r\n      Latin version of William's Charter, preserved at the Guildhall.\r\n\r\n   83 Liber Albus (Rolls Series i, 26).\r\n\r\n  M56 The office of port-reeve.\r\n\r\n   84 Opinions differ as to the derivation of the term port. Some, like\r\n      Kemble, refer it to the Lat. _portus_, in the sense of an enclosed\r\n      place for sale or purchase, a market. (\"Portus est conclusus locus,\r\n      quo importantur merces et inde exportantur. Est et statio conclusa\r\n      et munita.\"--Thorpe, i, 158). Others, like Dr. Stubbs (Const. Hist.,\r\n      i, 404 n.), connect it with Lat. _porta_, not in its restricted\r\n      signification of a gate, but as implying a market place, markets\r\n      being often held at a city's gates. The Latin terms _porta_ and\r\n      _portus_ were in fact so closely allied, that they both alike\r\n      signified a market place or a gate.

Their duties were practically\r\n      identical with those of sheriffs, and Bishop Stubbs places a\r\n      marginal note over against the appointment,--\"Sheriffs appointed by\r\n      the king.\" Walter Hervy is recorded as having removed certain stones\r\n      near Bucklersbury when he was \"improver\" of the city (Letter Book A,\r\n      fo. 84.

There is no evidence\r\n      of this in the City's Records, although there appears to have been a\r\n      disturbance at his re-election in 1384. It may be to this that the\r\n      Mercers' petition refers. It is noteworthy that at the time of his\r\n      election in 1383, Brembre was not an alderman, although in the\r\n      previous year, and again in the year following his election, he is\r\n      recorded as Alderman of Bread Street Ward.--Letter Book H, fos. 140,\r\n      163, 174.\r\n\r\n  652 Breve quod piscenarii libertatis civitatis Londoniae exerceant artem\r\n      suam ut consueverunt.
