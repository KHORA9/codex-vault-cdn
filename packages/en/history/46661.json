Compiled by North Dakota writers, the\r\npublication of this book has been made possible by means of Federal and\r\nState funds. The importance of this book lies, not only in calling the\r\nattention of tourists and other outsiders to the picturesque scenery\r\nand the places of historical significance in North Dakota; but in\r\nawakening the consciousness of North Dakota people to the historical,\r\nsociological, and cultural heritage which is theirs.\r\n\r\n                               (Signed) WILLIAM LANGER,\r\n                                              Governor of North Dakota.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_North Dakota: a Guide to the Northern Prairie State_ is something new\r\nin this part of the country. For the first time North Dakotans and\r\ntheir guests have a concise but comprehensive survey of the State,\r\nwhich tells them what should be seen, and why, and how. Our aim has\r\nbeen a book not only to be used in touring the State, but to be enjoyed\r\nby fireside travellers and all who would deepen their understanding of\r\nNorth Dakota.\r\n\r\nAs one of the volumes in the American Guide Series, written by\r\nthe members of the Federal Writers' Project of the Works Progress\r\nAdministration, the North Dakota guide has more than State\r\nsignificance, wide as this is. The National project was designed\r\nprimarily to give useful employment to needy writers and research\r\nworkers; it has developed into a more ambitious undertaking. The\r\nAmerican Guide Series, covering the forty-eight States, Puerto Rico,\r\nAlaska, and numerous cities and towns, is unrolling a unique and\r\ninspiring panorama of these United States with their lively background\r\nand their vibrant present. The North Dakota guide adds its contribution\r\nto the whole, giving the reader a picture of the State, its land and\r\nresources, its history, people, the cities and towns they have built,\r\nand the principal points of interest. New chapters in North Dakota's\r\nstory and other phases of its life and works are still to be told. This\r\nvolume--a pioneer enterprise in a State where the records of the past\r\nand the varied life of today had not heretofore been assembled--may\r\nwell serve as an incentive and a foundation for further books.\r\n\r\nNot ten or fifty or a hundred, but actually hundreds of North Dakotans\r\nhelped in the making of the guide, from the many who contributed\r\ninformation about their own communities or fields of work down to the\r\nhandful of editors and writers who brought that information within the\r\ncovers of this book. In expressing the Project's appreciation of this\r\nfriendly and cooperative help, so generously given, I wish particularly\r\nto thank Mr. Russell Reid, superintendent of the State Historical\r\nSociety of North Dakota, and his staff, especially Mrs. Florence\r\nH. Davis and Mr. Arnold Goplen; Mr. George Will and Mr. Robert A.\r\nRitterbush, of Bismarck; Dr. Irvin Lavine, of the University of North\r\nDakota; Mr. E. A. Milligan, of Michigan City; Mr. J. A. Patterson, of\r\nMinot; Dr. E. C. Stucke, of Garrison; and Mr. Henry Williams, of Appam.\r\n\r\n                                             ETHEL SCHLASINGER\r\n                                                _State Director_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  FOREWORD                                                             v\r\n\r\n  By William Langer, Governor of North Dakota\r\n\r\n  PREFACE                                                            vii\r\n\r\n  By Ethel Schlasinger, State Director, Federal Writers' Project\r\n\r\n  ILLUSTRATIONS AND MAPS                                            xiii\r\n\r\n  GENERAL INFORMATION                                                 xv\r\n\r\n  ANNUAL EVENTS                                                      xix\r\n\r\n\r\n  I.

Accommodations at lake resorts offered only during the\r\nsummer months. Quarters at lake resorts crowded Fourth of July week.\r\n\r\n=Sales and Cigarette Taxes:= Two percent sales tax on all purchases,\r\npayable in cash. Tax of 3c per package of 20 cigarettes.\r\n\r\n=Climate and Equipment:= Summer travelers should be prepared for\r\nextremely warm weather. It is advisable, however, to have topcoats of\r\nmedium weight as evenings are generally cool. In spring and fall the\r\ndays are intermittently cool and warm, and topcoats are a necessity.\r\nPersons unfamiliar with the Northwest should heed weather reports\r\nand bulletins of the State highway department and dress as warmly as\r\npossible during winter travel. What appears as a light flurry of snow\r\nmay in a few moments become a blizzard, blocking highways and making\r\ntravel impossible. Towns and farms are far apart; temperatures may\r\nsuddenly drop far below zero.\r\n\r\n=Recreational Areas:= Turtle Mountain area (_Tour 5_): swimming,\r\nfishing, boating, hiking, hunting. Roosevelt Regional State Parks:\r\nriding, motoring, hiking. Sheyenne River Park (_Tour 1_): picnicking,\r\nswimming, hiking; suitable in winter for skiing. Killdeer Mountain area\r\n(_Side Tour 8D_): hiking, riding, picnicking. Turtle River State Park\r\n(_Tour 6_): swimming, camping, picnicking. Large towns have ski and\r\ntoboggan slides, skating rinks.\r\n\r\n=Fish and Game Laws:= Game fish are defined as black bass, wall-eyed\r\npike, northern pike, perch, sunfish, crappie, trout, and landlocked\r\nsalmon.\r\n\r\n=Open Season for Fishing= (dates inclusive): Bass, crappie, and\r\nsunfish, June 16-Oct. 31; trout and landlocked salmon, May 2-Sept. 30;\r\npike, any species, and perch, May 16-Oct. 31. Governor has power to\r\nshorten or close season.\r\n\r\n=Licenses:= Resident, 50c, nonresident, $3. No license required of\r\npersons under age of 12. Issued by game and fish commissioner, State\r\ncapitol, Bismarck, county auditors at county courthouses.\r\n\r\n=Limits:= Bass, trout, and landlocked salmon, 5, nor more than 5 of\r\nall combined; wall-eyed pike and northern pike, 10, nor more than 10\r\nof both combined; crappie and sunfish, 15, nor more than 15 of both\r\ncombined; perch, 25. No bass, landlocked salmon, trout, or pike less\r\nthan 10 in.; no crappie less than 6 in.; no sunfish less than 5 in.\r\nThese limits daily; no person to have in possession more than 2-day\r\nlimit.\r\n\r\n=Prohibited:= No use of drugs, lime, fish berries, or explosives.\r\nUnlawful to take fish in any manner except by angling with hook and\r\nline held in hand or attached to rod. (Commercial fishing allowed in\r\ncertain sections, under commercial license.)\r\n\r\n=Open Season for Hunting:= Dates of hunting season for deer and game\r\nbirds vary from year to year as well as the areas where hunting is\r\nallowed. Copy of hunting laws furnished with hunting license.\r\n\r\n=Licenses:= Big game: resident, $5, nonresident, $50; hunting:\r\nresident, $1.50, nonresident, $25. Aliens not permitted to hunt.\r\nLicenses issued by game and fish commissioner, deputies, or county\r\nauditors.\r\n\r\n=Limits:= Bass, trout, and landlocked salmon, 5, nor more than 5 of\r\nbreasted grouse, ruffed grouse (partridge), Chinese pheasant, Hungarian\r\npartridge; 5 in the aggregate in a day, but number of each species\r\ncomposing aggregate varies in certain counties; 10 ducks, 4 geese\r\nincluding brant, 12 coots, and 10 jacksnipe a day. Not more than 1-day\r\nbag of migratory game birds may be possessed at one time. Deer may be\r\npossessed until 90 days after close of season.\r\n\r\nNonresident licensee may carry with him from State under license tag\r\na 2-day limit of game, if carried openly and labeled with his name,\r\naddress, and number of license.\r\n\r\n=Camp Fires:= Any person leaving a fire without thoroughly\r\nextinguishing it, so that it burns any wood or prairie, is guilty of a\r\nmisdemeanor punishable by fine, imprisonment, or both.\r\n\r\n=Poisonous Snakes and Plants:= Rattlesnakes are rare, but are sometimes\r\nfound in the following areas: south of Bismarck in Missouri River\r\nvicinity; western Emmons County, along Missouri; in valleys of Heart,\r\nLittle Missouri, and Cannonball Rivers; and in Badlands.\r\n\r\nAnyone bitten by a rattlesnake should cut wound with a sharp knife and\r\nsuck the blood to remove poison. A tourniquet should be placed above\r\nwound, and medical assistance sought at once.\r\n\r\nPoison-ivy common in wooded areas. In June it bears loose clusters of\r\ndull green-white blossoms, later in season replaced by glossy opaque\r\nberries of similar color. Poison-ivy vines often are hidden in long\r\ngrass and in foliage.\r\n\r\nTo prevent irritation from contact with poison-ivy, before going into\r\nwoods bathe hands and face with a 5-percent solution of ferric chloride\r\nin a half-and-half mixture of alcohol and water or glycerine and water.\r\nIf skin should come in contact with the plant, washing with one of\r\nabove solutions, or with laundry soap and warm water, is an excellent\r\ntreatment. Avoid spreading poison through scratching or rubbing.\r\nBathing affected areas in hot water will relieve irritation. If there\r\nare open sores do not use sugar of lead or zinc oxide.\r\n\r\n=Tourist Information Service:= General information about the\r\nState furnished on request by the secretary, Greater North Dakota\r\nAssociation, Fargo, N.

He may be told vaguely, \"It's out West\r\nsomewhere,\" or more specifically, \"North Dakota is a wheat State,\" or\r\n\"Isn't that where the farmers have this Nonpartisan League?\" These\r\nanswers are only partly correct, for they barely touch on the two major\r\nproblems, economics and politics, in regard to which North Dakota is\r\nnow coming of age.\r\n\r\nThis is a young State. Ruts left by the wagon trains of early\r\nexplorers, military expeditions, and home seekers have not yet been\r\neffaced from the prairies. Red men and white men, who hunted buffalo\r\nand fought at the Little Big Horn, who saw the railroads push their\r\ngleaming paths across the Plains, who recall a puny young man named\r\nTheodore Roosevelt hunting in the Badlands with his short-stocked\r\nrifle, still survive to tell their tales. In those fledgling days, the\r\nland was rich with promise. Bonanza farms unfolded their ample acres of\r\nwheat, thousands of cattle roamed unchecked in the gullies and over the\r\nplains of the western counties.\r\n\r\nThe word spread, and from Europe and the eastern States came men and\r\nwomen to break the new soil. Sod houses and barns and frame homes and\r\nwindmills set their seal on the prairies. Tons of wheat, thousands of\r\ncattle and sheep and horses attested to the fertility of North Dakota.\r\n\r\nFor more than half a century the soil was exploited recklessly. Then\r\nsuddenly exhaustion and drought drove home the growing realization that\r\nthis exploitation could not go on. Water conservation, diversified\r\nfarming, and dams quickly became part of the agricultural scheme, and\r\nare repairing the damage of unthinking abuse. Huge mineral resources\r\nhave been recognized and are being developed commercially, bringing a\r\nnew aspect to North Dakota's economy.\r\n\r\nMarketing of farm products has had reverberations in the economic\r\nlife of the State, and has made its people alert to changing social\r\ntrends. Characteristically, in the eastern portion of the State, where\r\nsoil is richer, and rainfall more plentiful, the people are more\r\nconservative; while to the west, where the climate is more arid and\r\nthe soil less productive, the \"isms\" flourish, providing a stronghold\r\nfor the leftist elements of the State's tumultuous political parties.\r\nBecause of antagonism to control of early agrarian activities by\r\nout-of-State business interests, the Nonpartisan League, with its\r\nsocialistic platform, was formed, and many of its enterprises have been\r\nestablished, some successfully, some otherwise. Cooperative economy is\r\nprominent in the social consciousness of agricultural North Dakota,\r\nand such groups as the Farmers' Union emphasize the trend toward\r\ncooperatives, strengthening their position by supplying members with\r\npurely social activities, as well as with hard economic problems into\r\nwhich to get their teeth.\r\n\r\nFreely admitted is the rural character of the State, and there is\r\nseldom an attempt to cover native crudities with a veneer of eastern\r\nculture. The few writers in the State recognize and honor the\r\npossibilities of their native material; and each year finds a scattered\r\nhandful of books, usually verse, telling of the North Dakota known to\r\nthem and to seven hundred thousand other North Dakotans.\r\n\r\nWhat is the North Dakota they know? A State of unbounded plains\r\nand hills and Badlands--elbowroom. Superb sunsets. High winds and\r\ntumbleweed. Farms and plows and sweeping fields. Gophers flashing\r\nacross the road. Little towns crowded on Saturday night, and busy\r\ncities shipping out the products of North Dakota and supplying the\r\nneeds of the producers. Sudden blinding, isolating blizzards, and\r\nsoft, fragrant spring days with tiny sprouts of grain peering greenly\r\nthrough the topsoil. Pasque flower and cactus, flame lily, and fields\r\nof yellow mustard. The sad, slow wail of a coyote on the still prairie.\r\nPeople--Norwegians, Germans, Russians, Poles, Czechs, Icelanders, but\r\nall Americans. Square dances in barn lofts, and college \"proms\" with\r\ncorsages and grand marches. Teachers building fires with numbed hands\r\nin stoves of icy one-room schools. Men in unaccustomed \"best clothes\"\r\nsitting in majestic legislative halls of a skyscraper statehouse.\r\nPolitical fires, sometimes smouldering, sometimes flaring, always\r\nburning.\r\n\r\nEndless facets are apparent in the temper and tenor of life, thought,\r\nand action of the people of this State, still a new people, pioneers--\r\n\r\n    \"_Brave spirits stirred with strange unrest,\r\n      They found broad waters and new lands,\r\n    And carved the empires of the west._\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTH DAKOTA: ITS NATURAL SETTING\r\n\r\n\r\nNorth Dakota is a rectangular area of 70,837 square miles, lying in\r\nwhat the United States Geological Survey has designated the center of\r\nthe North American Continent. It is approximately 1,500 miles from the\r\nAtlantic, the Pacific, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Arctic Archipelago\r\nof North America. North to south it extends 210 miles, and east to west\r\nan average of 335 miles. On the north are the Provinces of Manitoba and\r\nSaskatchewan, Canada; on the east, the Red River of the North and the\r\nBois de Sioux form the boundary between this State and Minnesota; on\r\nthe south is South Dakota and on the west, Montana.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SURFACE OF THE LAND\r\n\r\nThe land surface resembles three broad steps of prairie, rising a\r\nhalf-mile in altitude from the eastern to the western boundary. The\r\nfirst two steps lie in the Central Lowlands of the Interior Plains, the\r\nthird in the Great Plains area.\r\n\r\nThe lowest step is the fertile, floor-like Red River Valley, once the\r\nbed of glacial Lake Agassiz. Near the Canadian boundary the valley is\r\nabout 40 miles wide, but it gradually narrows until near the South\r\nDakota line it is only 10 miles in width. With its northward slope of\r\nonly about one foot to the mile, an even more gradual eastward slope,\r\nand few prominent surface features, the land offers no obstacles to\r\na view across miles of level checkerboard fields. Natural woods grow\r\nalong the Red River and its winding sluggish tributaries, and farmyard\r\ngroves dot the landscape.\r\n\r\nThe Pembina Escarpment, a rise of 300 to 400 feet along the western\r\nedge of the valley, defines the beginning of the central surface-step,\r\nthe Drift Prairie, or Drift Plain. At the northern end of the\r\nescarpment, which is a continuation of the Manitoba Escarpment in\r\nCanada, lie the wooded Pembina Mountains, jutting sharply above the\r\nvalley floor. South of these hills the rise is less pronounced except\r\nat the southern end, where the hills again become prominent to merge\r\nwith the Coteau des Prairies, an escarpment lying chiefly in South\r\nDakota.\r\n\r\nGlacial deposits, or drift, of finely ground rock, sand, and gravel\r\ngive the Drift Prairie its name. It is a rolling, fertile plain,\r\nvarying from 70 to 200 miles in width, and broken by low ridges of\r\nhills, shallow coulees, and numerous small lakes. To the northwest lies\r\nthe Souris River Valley, a small glacial lake bed resembling the Red\r\nRiver Valley. Devils Lake, largest in the State, lies in the northern\r\npart of the Drift Prairie, and together with Stump Lake forms the\r\nbasis of the interior drainage system; near its southern end are the\r\nheadwaters of the James and Sheyenne Rivers, both flowing southward,\r\nthe James into the Missouri and the Sheyenne into the Red.\r\n\r\nThe Missouri Escarpment, rising 300 to 400 feet above the Drift Prairie\r\nand cutting across the State diagonally in a northwest-southeast\r\ndirection, marks the rise of the third surface-step, the Missouri\r\nPlateau, which extends west to the Rocky Mountains. Lying along the top\r\nof the plateau, in some places not far from the escarpment and at other\r\npoints 50 miles west of it, is the Altamont Moraine, a belt of rough,\r\nstony hills, indicating the farthest advance of the Dakota lobe of the\r\nWisconsin ice sheet. In the north this moraine is a part of the Height\r\nof Land forming the watershed between the north-and south-flowing\r\nstreams of the continent.\r\n\r\nBetween the escarpment and the Missouri River the plateau is known\r\nas the Couteau du Missouri. West of the river it is known locally as\r\nthe Missouri Slope. The surface of the plateau, typical of the Great\r\nPlains, is irregular and rolling, dotted with old lake beds--some of\r\nwhich contain large deposits of sodium sulphate--and underlain with\r\nvast lignite beds and valuable clay and bentonite deposits.\r\n\r\nIn the Missouri Slope is the most unusual area in the State--the\r\nBadlands of the Little Missouri. Here erosion has formed, and continues\r\nto form, a fantastic array of buttes in which layers of brick-red\r\nscoria and gray, blue, and yellow clays are vividly exposed. Abrupt\r\nbuttes and mesas characterize the landscape, increasing in size and\r\nnumber toward the southwest corner of the State. Among them is Black\r\nButte, 3,468 feet above sea level, the highest point in North Dakota.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIMATE\r\n\r\nAbsence of great variation in physiography gives all portions of\r\nthe State an almost uniform climate. North Dakota is situated in a\r\ntemperate region of moderate rainfall, and owing to its position in\r\nthe center of the North American Interior Plains it has a typically\r\ncontinental climate.\r\n\r\nOne of the characteristics of such a climate is a wide range of\r\ntemperature, and to this the State can make good claim. North Dakota\r\nhas a recorded range from 124° F., registered September 3, 1912 at\r\nMedora, to -60° F., recorded February 15, 1936 at Parshall. These\r\ntemperatures are, of course, unusual, but the mercury often reaches\r\n100° F. during the summer, whereas 30° to 40° F. below zero is not\r\nuncommon in winter. The mean temperature for the months of June, July,\r\nand August is 65.7° F., and for December, January, and February, 9.7°\r\nF. Relatively low humidity, averaging 68 percent, makes these extremes\r\nless uncomfortable, however, than if the atmosphere contained more\r\nmoisture.\r\n\r\nThe sections of the State vary more in the matter of precipitation than\r\nin any other climatic phase. The average is about 18 inches annually,\r\nranging from about 22 inches in the southeastern corner to about 14\r\ninches in the southwestern corner. Most of the precipitation occurs\r\nin the late spring and summer. During the period of 1925-34, three\r\nyears had a rainfall in excess of normal, and seven were deficient in\r\nprecipitation.\r\n\r\nLong and severe winters are typical of this region. Nevertheless the\r\nsummers, though comparatively short, are favorable for agriculture,\r\nowing to the long hours of sunshine. At the maximum, about June 21,\r\nthere are as many as 16 hours of sunlight a day; and this, together\r\nwith cloudless skies, contributes to the rapid growth and early\r\nmaturity of crops.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE LAND WAS FORMED\r\n\r\nThe surface of North Dakota, comparatively unvaried, is no more simple\r\nthan the geological pattern that lies beneath it. Deposited by the seas\r\nof three geologic ages, horizontal layers of rock top each other in\r\nmethodical and unintricate succession.\r\n\r\nIn far-off Paleozoic times, when all creatures of the earth were\r\ninvertebrates, strange shellfish, unlike any existing today, lived\r\namong the rich foliage at the bottom of the shallow sea that covered\r\nthis region. Hundreds of varieties of fossil plants and shells are\r\nembedded in the sandstone, limestone, and shale which the sea deposited\r\non the uneven surface of the then-existent crystalline rocks. These\r\nPaleozoic rocks have been encountered in deep wells in eastern North\r\nDakota, although nowhere in the State are they found at the surface.\r\n\r\nToward the close of the Paleozoic era, changing climatic conditions\r\ncaused the death of many forms of life upon the earth, and the\r\ndevelopment of new and hardier types. With these, in the Mesozoic era,\r\ncame the new lords of the earth, the reptiles. Much of the globe from\r\nthe Arctic Ocean to New Mexico was covered by a great sea on whose\r\nswampy shores huge dinosaurs, alligators, and crocodiles made their\r\nhomes. Largest of these grotesque creatures was the brontosaurus, with\r\nhis long snakelike neck and face and huge body. Struggling with him\r\nfor supremacy of the swamps was the armored stegosaurus, whose row of\r\nvertical plates along his backbone from head to tip of tail made him a\r\nformidable enemy. Among the plant and animal life that throve on the\r\nsea bottom were shellfish three feet or more in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe earliest seas of the Mesozoic era deposited the Dakota sandstone\r\nthat underlies all of the State except the Red River Valley. It is a\r\nsoft white or gray stone, containing many marine fossils. Although\r\nit does not appear at the surface anywhere in the State, it has\r\nbeen studied from specimens obtained from deep wells here or from\r\noutcroppings in other States.\r\n\r\nMany rivers flowing into the prehistoric seas brought mud and clay to\r\nmix with the soils of the sea bottom, forming the shales that today\r\nunderlie most of the Great Plains, including North Dakota. The lowest\r\nof these, Benton shale, is dark gray, almost jet black in places, and\r\ncontains bits of pyrite (fool's gold) and gypsum. Over it lies the\r\nbluish-gray Niobrara shale, in which natural cement is found. In the\r\nPembina Mountains and the Sheyenne Valley, where these rocks appear\r\nat the surface, they have yielded shells of lamellibranchs (ancestors\r\nof today's clams and oysters) and bones of great sharklike fish. Over\r\nthese two strata lies the Pierre shale deposit, dark bluish-gray in\r\ncolor. It is frequently seen in the valleys of streams east of the\r\nMissouri Plateau, but outcrops in only two places west of the Missouri\r\nEscarpment--where the Missouri leaves the State, and in the valley of\r\nthe Little Beaver Creek in southwestern North Dakota. In it have been\r\nfound fossils of the chambered nautilus, the oyster, and other marine\r\nanimals, the crocodile, and the plesiosaur--that ungainly reptile which\r\nhad \"the body of a turtle strung on a snake.\"\r\n\r\nOnce again the sea covered the State and left the rust-colored Fox\r\nHills sandstone, which is particularly conspicuous along the Cannonball\r\nRiver where action of underground water has formed it into the\r\nrusty-looking spheres which give the river its name. Similarly formed\r\ncylinders of this sandstone in concretionary form are also found along\r\nthe stream, and large cylinders protrude from the top of Cannon Butte\r\nin the Badlands like the barrels of cannon from the turret of a huge\r\nbattleship.\r\n\r\nNear the close of the Mesozoic era, the climate of North Dakota became\r\nwarmer, almost like that of the South Atlantic States. Through the\r\nswamps roamed horned carnivorous dinosaurs, especially triceratops,\r\nwhich had \"the largest head with the smallest brain of the reptile\r\nrace.\"\r\n\r\nAgain and again the sea invaded this swampland, depositing the Lance\r\nformation, comprising layers of massive sandstone and shale in which\r\nthe luxuriant plant life of the area created thin beds of lignite\r\ncoal. The Lance formation underlies most of the Missouri Plateau, and\r\ncomes to the surface in two places--in the vicinity of Bismarck, and\r\nnear Marmarth. Reptilian fossils are found in both the lignite and the\r\nintervening layers of rock.\r\n\r\nAt the dawn of the Cenozoic age, as mammalian life began to develop on\r\nthe globe, another invasion of the sea left behind it a great plateau\r\ninterspersed with swamps, marshlands, rivers, and lakes. On the plain\r\ngrew giant sequoia, cypress, juniper, and other semitropical trees.\r\nOver the thick mat of mosses, lichens, and liverwort in the swamps\r\ncrept turtles, alligators, lizards, and other reptiles, monstrous in\r\nsize. King of this jungle was the titanothere, with its great body,\r\nshort stocky neck, and columnar legs. Long-jawed shaggy mastodons and\r\ngigantic rhinoceroses challenged its supremacy. As these titans of\r\nthe forest lumbered through the underbrush, herds of _Merycoidodon\r\nculbertsoni_ or ruminating hogs, _Leptomeryx evansi_, dainty deerlike\r\ncreatures no larger than jack rabbits, and little three-toed horses\r\nscampered out of their way.\r\n\r\nThe Fort Union formation, created through successive fresh water\r\ndeposits of sediment in the swamps, contained vast quantities of rank\r\nswamp vegetation. In the intervening millions of years this has been\r\nturned into lignite, a very soft coal which has become North Dakota's\r\nmost valuable mineral resource. The lignite veins in the formation\r\nindicate that the sea covered this area at least eleven times during\r\nthe period when the formation was being deposited. In addition to\r\nlignite, the Fort Union clay shales and sandstones contain pure plastic\r\nclay beds and some bentonite, a claylike mineral of commercial value.\r\n\r\nThe recession of the seas left a broad and gently rolling plain cut by\r\nsluggish rivers whose wooded valleys were inhabited by the descendants\r\nof the great swamp beasts. When the waters again invaded the plain,\r\nthe bones of these monsters were embedded in the deposits which became\r\nthe White River formation, youngest bedrock underlying the State.\r\nSo numerous are the fossil remains in the lower White River beds\r\nthat these strata are called the titanothere beds. Fossils are found\r\nthroughout the formation, however, ranging from mammal bones to the\r\nremains of fish and turtles. Erosion has worn away much of the White\r\nRiver formation in North Dakota, but it is conspicuously revealed on\r\nthe summits of White or Chalky Butte, Sentinel Butte, Black Butte, and\r\nthe Killdeer Mountains, and also in a few other small isolated areas in\r\nthe Missouri Slope.\r\n\r\nGradually, during the time these formations were being laid down, the\r\nwinters of this region were becoming more and more severe. Masses of\r\nice moved slowly southward from the Arctic Region, covering much of the\r\nland and transforming the nearby forests, meadows, and swamps into a\r\ntreeless plain of black mucky soil with a permanently frozen subsoil\r\novergrown with moss, lichens, and dwarf shrubs. Fierce wintry storms\r\ntook their toll of the mammoths, rhinoceroses, and reindeer living upon\r\nthe tundras.\r\n\r\nAs the glaciers moved south, the animals were forced to flee to warmer\r\nlands. Soon the ice mass had covered all of North Dakota except a very\r\nsmall region in the southwest corner beyond the Killdeer Mountains.\r\nWhen at length it receded, it left in its wake boulders, gravel, and\r\ntill--a drift soil composed of clay, sand, gravel, and boulders. Much\r\nof this now has been worn away; on the west side of the Missouri only a\r\nfew scattered areas remain, and on the east side the till, though more\r\ncontinuous, is often merely a veneer a few feet in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe early glacier was followed by the Wisconsin ice sheet, the Dakota\r\nlobe of which covered a large part of this State, pushing back the\r\nMissouri River, which had previously flowed north into Hudson Bay, into\r\nits present channel.\r\n\r\nEventually this glacier, too, melted and receded, leaving a great lake\r\nabout 650 feet deep, nearly 700 miles long, and 200 miles wide, with an\r\narea of not less than 110,000 square miles, including the region now\r\nknown as the Red River Valley. This lake has been named Lake Agassiz,\r\nin honor of Louis Agassiz, first prominent advocate of the theory that\r\ndrift was formed by land ice. Lake Agassiz existed some 10,000 years\r\nago, lasted for probably 1,000 years, and covered an area greater than\r\nthe present Great Lakes. Its sole remnants today are Lakes Winnipeg,\r\nWinnipegosis, and Manitoba, and Lake of the Woods.\r\n\r\nProductive soil and ground water, closely allied resources, are North\r\nDakota's greatest assets. The Wisconsin glacier and Lake Agassiz are\r\nlargely responsible for the fertile soils that cover three-fifths of\r\nthe State's surface. Through the Red River Valley the lake left a fine\r\nclaylike silt 20 to 30 feet deep. The successive shore lines of the\r\nlake, showing its gradual recession, can be plainly seen in the ridges\r\nof sand and gravel that rise 10 to 25 feet along the western edge of\r\nthe valley. Also on the west border of the valley are three extensive\r\nsand plains, the deltas of the Pembina, Sheyenne, and Elk Rivers,\r\nformed by glacial debris mingled with river silt. The Souris glacial\r\nlake bed, in the loop of the present Souris River, resembles the Red\r\nRiver Valley in geological history, but covers a much smaller area.\r\n\r\nImmediately under the silt of the old lake beds and on the surface of\r\nthe Drift Prairie is glacial drift or till. In much of the southwestern\r\npart of the State, particularly along the western tributaries of the\r\nMissouri, there are no glacial deposits; the topsoil is composed\r\nlargely of shale and sandstone, and, though not so fertile as the old\r\nlake beds and glacial plains to the east, provides fine range country.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL RESOURCES\r\n\r\nEspecially valuable to those who depend on the land for their\r\nlivelihood are the numerous artesian wells and natural springs which\r\nfurnish necessary water supplies. The artesian basin on the southern\r\nborder of the State and extending into South Dakota has been designated\r\nby a Federal authority as the most important in America and probably in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nPeople of the State have been awakened in recent years to a\r\nconsciousness of the need for water conservation. Long abuse of\r\nseemingly unlimited artesian supplies resulted in lessening pressure in\r\nthe wells. Simultaneously, drought, high winds, and the broken unwooded\r\nplains conspired to deplete the surface waters left by rains and winter\r\nsnows. Within 20 years one-third of the lakes in North Dakota became\r\nextinct.\r\n\r\nTo counteract these disastrous effects, a program of Federal, State,\r\nand private water and soil conservation has begun. Trees are being\r\nplanted to hold the soil and conserve the moisture of rain and snow.\r\nA program of dam construction is under way in every county in the\r\nState. Dry-land farming and supplemental irrigation have been adopted\r\nto conserve the soil and return to it the elements which it has lost\r\nthrough constant cultivation.\r\n\r\nNorth Dakota is indebted to the ancient seas and glaciers not only\r\nfor the fertility of its soil but also for many of its most important\r\nmineral resources. Almost inexhaustible is the vast supply of lignite,\r\nestimated at 600 billion tons, which underlies the western half of the\r\nState. The veins, once the luxuriant plant life of a far distant age,\r\nvary from a fraction of an inch to 40 feet in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe southwestern corner of the State contains excellent beds of clay,\r\ndeposited by the seas and now used for building materials and pottery.\r\nTwo beds in the Dickinson vicinity, each containing approximately 29\r\nmillion cubic yards, yield the finest clays in the State. A layer of\r\nyellow sand clay overlies the whitish plastic variety here; the two\r\ncombine to form a number of colors, and have the added advantage of\r\nbeing free from iron. Plastic clay beds of importance, although not so\r\nvaluable commercially as the Dickinson deposits, are found throughout\r\nthe southwestern corner of the State. They yield one of the rarest and\r\nmost valuable types of clay for pottery and other specialized purposes.\r\nShales found near the western clay beds are used in the manufacture of\r\ncheaper building materials.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of two large bentonite fields in southwestern North\r\nDakota in 1930 opened up a new mineral resource. This claylike mineral\r\nis used as a binding agent and filler in many commercial processes,\r\nsuch as the manufacture of soaps, paints, and cosmetics. The larger\r\ndeposit--in the Little Badlands--covers 25 square miles and contains\r\nabout 100 million tons of the mineral, while the Chalky Butte deposit\r\nnear Amidon contains about 60 million tons. The beds are easily\r\naccessible, being uncovered in many places.\r\n\r\nExtensive sodium sulphate deposits have been formed in old lake beds in\r\nthe northwestern corner of the State, where the mineral-bearing waters\r\nhave evaporated, leaving a deposit of sodium sulphate crystals. North\r\nof the town of Grenora, 1,150 acres are covered with sodium sulphate\r\nbeds ranging from a few inches to more than 30 feet in depth. Miller,\r\nNorth, and McKone Lakes, near Alkabo, contain more than 20 million\r\ntons. Sodium sulphate, also known as Glauber's salt, is commercially\r\nvaluable, especially in the pulp and paper industries. Owing to lack\r\nof knowledge of its existence in this country, it has been imported\r\nlargely from Canada.\r\n\r\nAlthough geologists have doubted that oil exists in commercial\r\nquantities in North Dakota, considerable interest has been shown in\r\nthe wells near Marmarth in the southwestern corner of the State. Their\r\nproximity to the Montana oil fields increases the possibility of the\r\nsuccess of these wells. Much interest has also been shown in the\r\ndevelopment of a potential oil field south of Ray in northwestern North\r\nDakota.\r\n\r\nHidden beneath the earth's surface are other minerals deposited\r\nduring the geologic formation of the various strata. These include\r\nfuller's earth, sandstone, granite, gneiss, and gold; but because of\r\ntheir limited quantity and inaccessibility, they are commercially\r\nunimportant. The glacial deposits are important because they include\r\nthe sand and gravel used extensively for road surfacing. Some of the\r\neastern lake beds contain marl, a clay from which Portland cement is\r\nmade. The extent and purity of the deposits are not definitely known.\r\n(For discussion of industrial development of mineral resources see\r\nINDUSTRY AND LABOR.)\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANT AND ANIMAL LIFE\r\n\r\nNorth Dakota falls into three distinct zones of plant and animal life:\r\nthe Turtle Mountain region and a few scattered areas in the Canadian,\r\nor cold, zone; the Missouri and Little Missouri Valleys in the upper\r\naustral, or warmer, zone; and the remainder of the State in the\r\ntransition zone.\r\n\r\nBecause of its semiarid climate, the State has only 600 square miles of\r\nwooded area. Native forests are found chiefly along streams and lakes,\r\nand in the Turtle and Killdeer Mountains. Despite the limited forested\r\narea, a surprising variety of trees is found. Throughout the Red River\r\nValley, Turtle Mountains, and Devils Lake region plant life is similar\r\nto the Minnesota type, while such trees as the elm, green ash, box\r\nelder, poplar, and cottonwood are also common.\r\n\r\nAlthough the cottonwood's ability to withstand drought makes it one of\r\nthe most desirable species of trees in North Dakota, efforts are being\r\nmade in many towns to eradicate the tree because of the ubiquitous soft\r\nwhite \"cotton\" which floats from its branches like summer flurries of\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\nDuring the fall and early winter, the thickets of the northern Red\r\nRiver Valley are aflame with the highbush cranberry, which lent its\r\nIndian name to Pembina, first permanent white settlement in the State.\r\nOther berries grow profusely along all the eastern streams, and many\r\nfamilies assure themselves of a winter supply of jams and jellies by\r\npicking the June berries, chokecherries, wild plums, and wild grapes.\r\nIn the woods along the Missouri and Little Missouri grow trees of the\r\nMissouri type--the broadleaf cottonwoods, willows, ash, elm, buffalo\r\nberry, and flowering currant. A trace of the Rocky Mountain type\r\nof forest is found in the Badlands and on the buttes of the Little\r\nMissouri, where the yellow pine and red cedar grow.\r\n\r\nNot only trees but other forms of vegetation differ widely from the\r\neastern to the western sections of the State. The long Indian-grass and\r\nblue grass typical of the east is replaced on the western ranges by\r\nshort buffalo grass and grama grass, the two forming a dense mat over\r\nthe ground. Due to differences in rainfall, the western grasses are\r\nmuch duller and more grayish in color than those of the eastern section.\r\n\r\nFrom early spring to the first frosts of autumn, thousands of wild\r\nflowers brighten the prairies. Many species are general throughout\r\nthe State, while others are typical only of certain sections. Before\r\nthe last patches of snow are gone, the blue-gray pasque flower, so\r\nlike the crocus that it is often called by that name, appears on the\r\nrolling prairies and the northern slopes of hills. It is soon followed\r\nby the wild parsley, Nuttall's or yellow violet, and the vivid plumes\r\nof the purple avens. Most of the spring flowers are of soft, delicate\r\nhues, such as the white meadow rue, parsley, false-Solomon's-seal,\r\nsilverberry, squaw-weeds, meadow parsnip, blue-eyed-grass, and harebell.\r\n\r\nWith the coming of midsummer, the colors become more brilliant. The\r\nfragrant prairie rose, the State flower, blossoms profusely in fields\r\nand along roadsides. The showy oxeye or false-sunflower, the flaming\r\nprairie mallow, wild blue and yellow flax, the vivid flame lily, the\r\npurple coneflower, and the black-eyed Susan emblazon the summer fields.\r\nAlong the Pembina and Sheyenne Rivers, and in Sully's Hill National\r\nGame Preserve, grow the wintergreen and ladyslipper. Water lilies float\r\non pools and shallow streams in the western part of the State. In the\r\nBadlands grow the rabbit brush, butte primrose, false-lupine, and\r\nprickly pear, and the scoria lily which resembles a thistle during the\r\nday and opens its fragile, waxy petals only after the sun has gone down.\r\n\r\nYellow is the color of the prairies in autumn, as amid the fading\r\nfoliage the goldenrod, sunflower, aster, and blazing star dominate the\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nSome wild flowers, such as the wild morning-glory, are so common that\r\nthey are regarded as weeds. These are not so obnoxious to the farmer,\r\nhowever, as the Russian-thistle, pigeon grass, quack grass, pigweed,\r\nmustard, burdock, and sow thistle which often invade the grainfields.\r\nThe seeds of most of these plants were brought in with seed grain from\r\nEuropean countries, and their eradication is a difficult process.\r\nAnother obnoxious plant, against which a strong campaign has been\r\nconducted by farmers, is the common barberry, on which thrive the\r\nparasitic fungi that cause wheat rust. Many weeds, however, are\r\nconsidered a valuable asset to the fields and pasture lands where they\r\ngrow. These include the American vetch or wild sweet pea, which forms\r\nan important addition to hay, and the white and violet prairie clovers,\r\nwhich, although too tough to be used for fodder, serve to enrich the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nWhen the first settlers came to this section of the country, they\r\ndescribed the land as being covered with innumerable varieties of\r\nwild flowers. Since that time, cultivation and drought have changed\r\nthe picture. Efforts to preserve the native plant life in its natural\r\nsetting have met with cooperation from Federal and State agencies\r\nalike. The reserves that have been established are also sanctuaries for\r\nbird and animal life, upon which recent drought and severe winters have\r\nhad a disastrous effect.\r\n\r\nUnder the auspices of the State game and fish commission, 2,700 acres\r\nof land have been set aside as five game and fish farms, while 240,000\r\nacres of privately owned land have been designated as game refuges.\r\nThe Federal Government has established some 60 sanctuaries on 225,000\r\nacres, of which about 90,000 acres are privately owned.\r\n\r\nAnimal life zones in the State are more marked than are plant life\r\nzones. The woods of the Turtle Mountains, at the meeting point of the\r\nCanadian and transition zones, abound with wild life of both regions.\r\nMore than 300 varieties of game and song birds live here, including the\r\nDakota song sparrow, the black-billed cuckoo, the oriole, and the blue\r\njay. In the deserted holes of badgers, foxes, and gophers live those\r\nqueer prairie birds, the burrowing owls. Grebe, ducks, geese, heron,\r\nand occasionally swan inhabit the lakes of the region. Deer, red fox,\r\nrabbits, red squirrels and northern chipmunks are common; and at night\r\nthe bright-eyed, mousy Richardson shrew and the silver-haired bat can\r\nbe seen. Lynx are occasionally reported.\r\n\r\nIn the Red River Valley and the central prairies of the State, once\r\nthe scene of buffalo hunts, very little large game is found today. A\r\nfew buffalo remain in Sully's Hill National Game Preserve, and in the\r\nSheyenne Valley and the Pembina Mountains deer are still found. Game\r\nbirds abound in this region, however, and with the restoration of their\r\nbreeding places they are now being propagated in huge numbers on the\r\nmany reserves.\r\n\r\nEarly travelers in the western part of the State were astonished by the\r\nprairie-dog villages which dotted the country. Some of these villages\r\nstill exist, in the extreme western sections. Their inhabitants are\r\ntypical of the upper austral zone, as are also the coyotes whose\r\nlong melancholy wail can be heard across the prairie at twilight or\r\ndaybreak. Chipmunks, squirrels, gophers and ferrets also make their\r\nhomes here. Along the Missouri and in the forested areas of the\r\nBadlands are both white-tailed and mule deer. The one bird peculiar to\r\nthe austral zone is the sage-hen; and the American magpie, commonly\r\nseen here, is rare in other parts of the State.\r\n\r\nBirds such as the robin, sparrow, blackbird, swallow, horned lark, and\r\nmeadow lark are common to the entire State. The lark is one of the\r\nearly spring comers, and its clear sweet whistle can be heard when the\r\nprairies are just beginning to turn green.\r\n\r\nOne of the most common animals in the State is Richardson's ground\r\nsquirrel, otherwise known as the gopher or \"flickertail.\" It is from\r\nthis tiny, agile, yellow creature that North Dakota gets its name of\r\n\"the Flickertail State.\" Another familiar prairie animal is the jack\r\nrabbit.\r\n\r\nFish life, like that of plants and animals, has been adversely affected\r\nby recent droughts, but efforts are being made to propagate fish and\r\nto provide sufficient water for their existence. In the larger lakes\r\nand rivers, perch, black and rock bass, pickerel, pike, sunfish, and\r\ncatfish are found. Some landlocked salmon have been introduced, but\r\nthey are not adapted to North Dakota lakes and streams. Suckers and\r\ncarp are common but they are not considered desirable game fish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANS AND THEIR PREDECESSORS\r\n\r\n\r\nPREHISTORIC MAN IN NORTH DAKOTA\r\n\r\nJust when and where in the shadowy, endless past the Indians of North\r\nDakota, or even of the two Americas, began to break away from the\r\nparent stem is not known. Weapons and tools shaped from stone and found\r\nin strata that settled into place near the end of the Pleistocene, or\r\nglacial, period indicate that as much as 15,000 to 20,000 years ago\r\nmen wandered along the rivers and through the swamps of those areas\r\nthat later became New Mexico, Nebraska, and Minnesota. Very probably,\r\nin long hunts after game, parties of these men penetrated what is now\r\nNorth Dakota. Stone tools and weapons found in the vicinity of Bismarck\r\nsuggest an early occupation of the area, how long ago no one knows.\r\n\r\nA great many years nearer the present day, but still possibly a\r\nthousand or more years ago, men were digging busily in the flint\r\nquarries 19 miles north of Hebron and 12 miles northwest of Dodge and\r\nat other points on the Knife River. With the flint obtained here they\r\nfashioned arrowheads and spear points to kill buffalo or to protect\r\ntheir homes against enemy tribesmen. One of these heavily sodded sites\r\non the Knife River contains more than 300 pits, most of which are from\r\n8 to 10 feet across, and from 3 to 5 feet deep.\r\n\r\nThe extensive mounds and earthworks found in the eastern half of North\r\nDakota have been only imperfectly investigated so far, partly because\r\narcheologists have but recently recognized the possibilities of the\r\narea. The skeletons and the bone and stone manufactured articles lately\r\ndiscovered, however, as well as the general finds of the region,\r\nsuggest the probability of outlining tribal movements of importance.\r\nThere is an increasing suggestion that before the time of the historic\r\ntribes the prairies of the eastern half of the State supported large\r\npopulations. It is thought that, just as the Cheyenne are known to have\r\ndone in the historic period, in prehistoric time the Assiniboin and the\r\nBlackfeet, and preceding them still other tribes, carried on a settled\r\nagricultural life before they became nomadic. Of course the movements\r\nof these tribes were not confined entirely to what is now North Dakota.\r\n\r\nPerhaps hundreds of years after the construction of the mounds in\r\nthe eastern half of the State--possibly from one to four hundred\r\nyears ago--some tribe or tribes, probably the Sioux or certain\r\nof the village-building Indians, were putting together the turtle\r\neffigies frequently encountered on the hills west of the Missouri,\r\nand constructing the more widespread and better-known boulder-ring\r\neffigies. The purpose of these crude outlines on the prairie is not\r\ndefinitely known. Because the turtle plays a prominent part in medicine\r\nceremonies of the Mandan Indians, some think the turtle effigies were\r\nmade to win the favor of certain spirits. Others claim they were made\r\nto point the weary Indian to good water--a theory which may also apply\r\nto a number of the cairns occasionally seen piled on the tops of high\r\nhills. Other cairns are ceremonial or commemorative.\r\n\r\nBoulder rings, which sometimes appear in large numbers but more often\r\npresent only one or two specimens in a given location, were once\r\nthought to be tipi rings. The fact that many of them appear on the\r\nsides and tops of hills has discredited this assumption, however.\r\n\r\nVeneration of the so-called sacred stones of the State probably began\r\nin the effigy-building period, but the origin of the very interesting\r\nwriting rocks (_see Side Tours 3B, 4A, 8A, and 8C_) is undoubtedly far\r\nmore ancient. The significance of the markings on these rocks has not\r\nyet been determined.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMING OF THE NORTH DAKOTA INDIAN TRIBES\r\n\r\nAbout the time the earlier turtle effigies were made--perhaps 200\r\nyears ago--in permanent villages of earth lodges in the valley of\r\nthe Missouri dwelt a most interesting group of people, raising many\r\ncultivated plants, building fortified towns, and in general living\r\na rather ordered existence. These were the Mandan, as far as is\r\ndefinitely known the first of the historic tribes to enter the State.\r\nTheir exact origin is not clear. Certain of their traditions claim\r\nthat they long ago lived in the East near a great body of water--most\r\nauthorities suggest the East Coast or Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, many generations before the coming of the whites, the\r\nMandan--probably crowded by other tribes--began to wander westward.\r\nApparently their long trek finally brought them and their wives and\r\nchildren to the junction of the White River with the Missouri in what\r\nis now South Dakota. Grass-grown sites of their old villages along\r\nthe benchland of the river show how these people, in quest of a new\r\nand more satisfactory home, moved northward in successive migrations\r\nuntil in time they arrived at the mouth of the Heart River in the\r\nneighborhood of present Mandan and Bismarck. Here they probably\r\nremained for generations, carrying on a settled agricultural life. They\r\nwere visited by the Verendryes in 1738 (_see Tour 8_), at which time\r\nthey had six large, well-fortified villages. Estimates of their number\r\nat this time have ranged from 2,500 to 15,000.\r\n\r\nThey are one of those four North Dakota Indian groups--Mandan, Hidatsa,\r\nCheyenne, and Arikara--who because of their farming activities are\r\ncalled the agricultural tribes. While the Mandan were building on the\r\nMissouri, the Hidatsa were probably living somewhat farther north and\r\neast. They have a tradition that they originally came from a large\r\nlake to the east, possibly Devils Lake. Later, probably forced on\r\nby some other tribe, they moved their families over the prairies to\r\nthe Missouri in the region of the Heart River, and eventually allied\r\nthemselves with the Mandan. Their history thereafter follows very\r\nclosely that of the latter tribe.\r\n\r\nWhile the Mandan and Hidatsa were dwelling on the Missouri, the\r\nCheyenne were migrating westward from the headwaters of the\r\nMississippi, by way of Lac Que Parle in present Minnesota, Lake\r\nTraverse, and the big bend of the Sheyenne River, to the Missouri,\r\nseeking a place where they could till the soil and rear their children\r\nin peace, free from the harrying of the Sioux.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the Arikara, doubtless likewise trying to take their\r\nfamilies away from the ravaging Dakota, were ascending the Missouri.\r\nThe name of this tribe arose from their custom of wearing in their hair\r\ntwo pieces of bone which stood up on each side of the head like horns.\r\nThey came from the southwest and their language differs only in dialect\r\nfrom the Pawnee. In 1770 French traders encountered them dwelling along\r\nthe river bank somewhat below the mouth of the Cheyenne River in what\r\nis now South Dakota.\r\n\r\nThe migrations of the Hidatsa, Cheyenne, and Arikara, as those of\r\nthe Mandan, are traceable by the old village sites, of which there\r\nare about 75 known locations on the prairies of the State. Arikara\r\nsites predominate lower down the Missouri in South Dakota; the older\r\nMandan--perhaps constructed as early as 1575-1650--in the Heart River\r\nregion; and the Hidatsa, farther north near the Knife River. There\r\nare apparently two types, a newer and an older. The newer, perhaps\r\nless carefully laid out than the older, is found at and above the\r\nmouth of the Heart River. The older type appears to have had better\r\nfortifications than the newer, and the lodges do not seem to have been\r\nso crowded. Because of its greater age it is more heavily sodded, and\r\nthus manufactured articles left by the village dwellers, such as stone\r\nand bone tools and ornaments, are less easily recovered. It seems\r\nto center below the Heart River, with the Huff site, just below the\r\nvillage of Huff, as perhaps the best example (_see Tour 8_).\r\n\r\nSometime--perhaps a hundred years--after the Mandan first built\r\nabout the mouth of the Heart River, the three nomadic North Dakota\r\ntribes--the Sioux, Assiniboin, and Chippewa--were ranging the forests\r\nnear the headwaters of the Mississippi. The Chippewa, however, were not\r\nstrictly nomadic, as they had more or less permanent camping places,\r\nwhere they built their distinctive bark shelters.\r\n\r\nThe Chippewa wandered from the Lake region across Minnesota to the\r\nTurtle Mountains. They cultivated maize and were apparently more or\r\nless at peace with the Sioux until in the early eighteenth century the\r\ncoming of the whites brought them firearms. With this advantage they\r\novercame the Sioux and drove them south and west.\r\n\r\nThe Assiniboin were a large tribe, whose language, with only a very\r\nslight dialectal difference from that of the Yanktonai tribe of the\r\nSioux, suggests they had not long been separated from the latter\r\nwhen first encountered by the whites near the headwaters of the\r\nMississippi. At the beginning of the eighteenth century they were in\r\nthe neighborhood of Lake Winnipeg, whence they drifted southward to the\r\nterritory west of the Turtle Mountain region in present North Dakota.\r\n\r\nThe Sioux apparently once lived in the Ohio Valley, but prior to the\r\nhistoric period they moved out in several directions. At the coming of\r\nthe whites in the middle seventeenth century they were found in the\r\nwoods in northern Minnesota. Pressed by the Chippewa, they extended\r\ntheir range westward over the prairies to the Missouri, and west of\r\nthat stream, from the Yellowstone River on the north to the Platte on\r\nthe south, to cover a huge block of territory throughout which the name\r\nof this powerful tribe was feared and dreaded by all other Indians.\r\n\r\nOf these seven North Dakota peoples--Mandan, Hidatsa, Cheyenne,\r\nArikara, Sioux, Assiniboin, Chippewa--well-authenticated records exist.\r\nIt will be noted that nearly all except the Arikara seem to have come\r\nfrom the east, particularly from the Lakes region, with the added\r\nsuggestion of an earlier residence farther east or south. There is also\r\nin some cases a definite shift from a settled agricultural life to a\r\nnomadic one. They apparently arrived in the State in the following\r\norder:\r\n\r\n  Mandan\r\n  Hidatsa, also known as Gros Ventres, Minitari, and Absaroke\r\n  Cheyenne\r\n  Assiniboin, also called Stone\r\n  Sioux, also called Dakota\r\n  Arikara\r\n  Chippewa, also called Ojibway\r\n\r\nLinguistically all the North Dakota tribes are Siouan, except the\r\nArikara, who are Caddoan, and the Chippewa and Cheyenne, who are\r\nAlgonquian.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY INDIAN LIFE IN NORTH DAKOTA\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to visualize the prairie scene centuries ago when the\r\nIndian ruled the plains. The agricultural tribes usually built their\r\nvillages of earth lodges so that one or more sides lay along a high\r\ncliff or next to a river. This afforded partial protection from the\r\nSioux. In the more ancient types an earthen wall, sometimes built with\r\nbastions, protected the exposed sides. A log palisade topped the wall,\r\nand around the whole a ditch was dug. The number of lodges in a village\r\nvaried from 30 or 40 to as high as perhaps 160. Catlin said the lodges\r\nhad the appearance of huge inverted kettles, above which rose spears,\r\nand scalp and medicine poles.\r\n\r\nThe lodges in the older types of villages were arranged with a certain\r\ndegree of uniformity. In the Mandan villages the lodges faced the\r\ncenter, where stood a large barrel or hogshead, called the Big Canoe.\r\nSoon after the Mandan came upon the earth, it is told, a great flood\r\ncame and would have destroyed them utterly had not a wise Mandan, the\r\nFirst Man, with superlative effort and dexterity, built a great canoe\r\nor ark and hurried the surviving people into it. This staunch ark\r\nweathered the fury of the waters and finally came to rest on a high\r\nhill near the Cannonball River (_see Side Tour 8C_). The Big Canoe in\r\nthe center of the village was a symbol of this ark.\r\n\r\nUniformity was not so evident in the later types of villages.\r\nBetween the lodges only room enough was left for men and women of\r\nthe village to pass; consequently, the broad earth roofs served the\r\nadditional purpose of verandas. Out upon these roofs, especially in the\r\nsummertime, was much activity--children played, old men watched for\r\nenemy tribesmen, sweethearts conversed, neighbors gossiped. Although\r\nthe tribes were often ruthless and cruel in war, in their prairie homes\r\nand villages they were very friendly and companionable people. Both men\r\nand women indulged in a great number of games, and spent a good deal\r\nof time in visiting, feasting, and dancing. Catlin upon his departure\r\nafter living with the Mandans for months was loaded with gifts and\r\nurged to continue his visit.\r\n\r\nHeavy garments were worn in the winter, and at that season the buffalo\r\nrobe was very much in evidence both for bedcovering and as an article\r\nof clothing; but in summer time clothing was rather scanty. Both men\r\nand women went down to the grassy shore of the Missouri in the morning\r\nto bathe, often with little regard for dress--a fact that greatly\r\nshocked some early travelers.\r\n\r\nAs the morning sun flooded the narrow dirt lanes of one of these\r\nvillages, braves, clad in breechcloths and moccasins, might have been\r\nseen preparing for a hunt, while naked boys played with scores of\r\nscampering dogs. If the village was Mandan, some of the hunters were\r\nsurprisingly Caucasian in appearance--the skin somewhat lighter than\r\nthat of the average Indian, the nose not so broad, and the cheekbones\r\nless prominent. Early travelers noted cases of extraordinarily\r\nlight complexions, and also instances of brown hair and blue\r\neyes--characteristics suggesting European blood. By certain of the\r\nfirst white visitors the Hidatsa were regarded as being rather superior\r\nintellectually, but this was not so apparent in later days.\r\n\r\nAt their sides the hunters carried knives and bows and arrows in\r\nleather sheaths. If they were going out to kill rabbit, ducks, geese,\r\nbeaver, deer, or elk along the river bottom, they might go afoot. If\r\nthey sought the wilder bighorn sheep or the buffalo, however, they\r\nbrought their ponies from the lodges, where they had been quartered\r\novernight, as that was the safest place available. Lariats, bridles,\r\nand saddles were of leather. To protect themselves from enemy attack\r\nthe hunters had spears, tomahawks, shields, and lances, in addition to\r\nthe ever present bows and arrows.\r\n\r\nAs they threaded their way between the lodges, here and there they\r\nsaw some of their women baking pottery of a mixture of clay and\r\npowdered granite or flint--Catlin says they modeled it into a thousand\r\nforms, and that some of their pottery held as much as five gallons.\r\nOther women, using bone awls and needles, were decorating girdles,\r\nfans, moccasins, and dresses with beadwork and embroidery. Clothing,\r\nespecially headdress, was elaborate and spectacular on ceremonial\r\noccasions. Still other women were weaving wickerwork, both flat and in\r\nthe form of baskets; making bone spoons, ladles, and other household\r\nutensils; fashioning implements for the work in their gardens; and\r\nworking over hides stretched on crude frames, in the process of\r\ntanning. In the latter art all the North Dakota tribes were unusually\r\nproficient. Hides prepared by them retained their softness and\r\nresilience even after being subjected to moisture many times.\r\n\r\nFarther on, a group of boys hovered about a hoary old man who sat near\r\nthe door of a lodge in the soft summer sun and told them the history\r\nand traditions of their tribe. They had just come in from the prairie\r\noutside the village, where the older warriors had been teaching them\r\nthe art of war by leading them in a sham battle. The victorious side\r\nhad danced the scalp dance, just as their elders did after the actual\r\ntaking of scalps, and now all were gathered about this old man to hear\r\nthe stories of their people. If the village was Mandan, very possibly\r\nthe old man was telling them of the great tribal hero, Good Furred\r\nRobe, who is supposed to have played so large a part in establishing\r\nthe Mandan way of living. The narrator would tell them, too, that the\r\nMandan were the first people created in the world, and that originally\r\nthey lived inside the earth, where they raised many vines. Of course,\r\nthey were constantly striving and struggling to find a way out of this\r\ndark, underground world. Finally one of their vines pushed its way\r\nthrough a hole in the earth overhead, and some of their people climbed\r\nup and out into a rich, fine country. A large fat woman, trying to\r\nclimb out, broke the vine, however, and the remainder of the Mandans\r\nlive underground to this day.\r\n\r\nThe storyteller also had another version of the beginning of things. At\r\nfirst the world was entirely water, inhabited by no living creature but\r\na swan, which in some unaccountable way produced a crow, a wolf, and a\r\nwater hen. Through the unsparing efforts of the crow to improve their\r\nsituation the water hen was finally sent to the bottom of the waters\r\nto fetch some earth. Taking a small quantity of this in her bill, the\r\ncrow made the earth. Later, persevering in her labor of improving their\r\nlot, she assumed the form of an Indian, and made all the beasts, birds,\r\nfishes, and insects, and became the first of all Indians.\r\n\r\nIf the aged narrator had been an Arikara, his story would have been\r\nsimilar to that of the Mandan. The Arikara believed that they together\r\nwith all other living things existed first in an embryo state deep\r\nwithin the earth. There they gradually developed, and after many\r\ngenerations of patient struggle were at last successful in their\r\nattempt to get to the surface. As they emerged, they were directed by\r\na Voice, which remained with them, comforting and guiding them until\r\nafter many hardships and vicissitudes they came to a fair land. Here\r\nthere came to them a beautiful woman--the one whose voice had led them.\r\nShe was Mother Corn, the protective spirit of the agricultural tribes,\r\nand the one who gave them their staple food grain.\r\n\r\nAs the hunters passed along they heard through the village the sound of\r\nmusic--crude flutes, whistles, and drums. All the North Dakota tribes\r\nwere musical, even though their product was hampered by the limitations\r\nof their scale, which had only five notes. Frances Densmore has placed\r\nhundreds of their songs in notation, copies of which are published in\r\nthe bulletins of the Smithsonian Institution.\r\n\r\nNow and then, above the sound of the music, voices raised in wailing\r\nwere heard. These came from the scaffold cemetery on the prairie just\r\noutside the village, whither some had withdrawn to lament the death of\r\nloved ones. Great mourning followed upon a death--the wailing could\r\noften be heard for miles. The Mandan slashed themselves until their\r\nbodies were covered with blood, and mourned for a year. In the tree or\r\nscaffold method of burial, the one usually followed by the North Dakota\r\ntribes, the cemetery was ordinarily situated only two or three hundred\r\npaces from the village. The body was wrapped in blankets and placed\r\nupon the scaffold very soon after death--some say before the sun again\r\nsank below the prairies. The Arikara and the Chippewa placed their dead\r\nin the ground, the former resting the body in a sitting posture, or on\r\nits side, with the knees drawn up, in a shallow stone-lined grave. The\r\nlatter people believed the spirit followed a wide, beaten path to the\r\nwest, at the end of which lay everything an Indian could desire.\r\n\r\nThe Sioux thought the soul must journey after death toward the land\r\nfrom which the west wind comes. They believed that the soul did not\r\nleave the body until after nightfall. A horse was killed beneath\r\nthe tree or scaffold, in order that the spirit of the animal might\r\ncarry the spirit of the Indian to the Milky Way, which was regarded\r\nas the pathway of ghosts. On this pathway the spirit of the dead was\r\nmet by the Old Woman with the Stick. If he passed the proper tests,\r\nshe directed him down the left fork of the Milky Way to the Northern\r\nLights, which were regarded as the campfires of the departed heroes and\r\ngood people of the tribe. If he could not meet the tests, however, she\r\npushed him along the right fork over a precipice; and he and his horse\r\nwere there changed into beetle bugs forever.\r\n\r\nThe above-ground type of cemetery undoubtedly contributed to the\r\nspread of disease. Of course, the tribes were subject to a variety of\r\nmaladies, smallpox being the most dreaded. From this latter scourge the\r\nagricultural people suffered disastrously; the Mandan were nearly wiped\r\nout by it in the early nineteenth century. In the treatment of disease\r\ncertain medicinal herbs were used rather intelligently, and the vapor\r\nbath was of distinct value; but when it came to the more severe forms\r\nof sickness, the primitive sufferers called in the medicine men and\r\ntrusted to their incantations.\r\n\r\nAs the hunters, saddened by the wailing of the mourners, went on\r\ntheir way, sounds of an altogether different type might have come to\r\nthem--sounds of joy--of a wedding in progress. The bridegroom would\r\nhave delivered the horses with which he paid for his bride, and the\r\nguests would be gathered at the lodge for the feast, which usually\r\nconsummated the relatively simple affairs that courtship and marriage\r\nwere among the prairie Indians. Perhaps the groom already had several\r\nwives--the possession of 6 was a common situation, and the great men\r\nof the tribe sometimes had as many as 14. Since the women did much of\r\nthe work of field and lodge, the acquisition of another wife was not\r\nan added burden. Despite the existence of polygamy, however, Indian\r\nfamilies were not large.\r\n\r\nThe babies of the party would be seen strapped to board cradles, where\r\na good part of infancy was spent in those days--a life that must have\r\nhad its pleasant features. In this point of vantage a child could be\r\nset up by the side of the tipi or lodge to enjoy the sunshine, be hung\r\nup in a tree to talk to the birds, or be carried at the side of a horse\r\nor on the back of its mother to look serenely over the far prairies.\r\n\r\nAt this point a courier might have detained the hunters and delivered\r\na message requesting the presence of some of them at a council of\r\nthe leading men of the tribe, called to consider pressing affairs of\r\ngovernment. Among the Plains Indians, government varied greatly, being\r\ndependent upon a combination of custom and tradition and the personal\r\nfitness and character of the chief. Perhaps the latter element played\r\na greater part in the swiftly changing life of the nomadic tribes,\r\nwhile among the more settled agricultural peoples, tradition and the\r\nhereditary rights of chieftainship had more authority. Nearly all the\r\ntribes were divided into a number of clans or bands.\r\n\r\nIf the supply of meat was running low, and no buffalo had been near\r\nthe village for a long time, the big question before the council might\r\nhave been whether or not the tribe should conduct the buffalo dance.\r\nThe agricultural tribes did not like to go far from the protection of\r\ntheir villages because of the enemy Sioux, and often resorted to the\r\nbuffalo dance, which never failed to bring the buffalo, because it was\r\ndanced until buffalo came. The dancers donned buffalo skins, the head\r\nof the dancer being placed in the head of the skin so that the eyes\r\nlooked out as the buffalo's had; the horns projected above the head,\r\nand the tail dragged on the ground. Thus garbed, they danced in the\r\ncenter of the village, going through all the antics of the buffalo.\r\nDuring the days of the buffalo dance, the yelping of the people and the\r\nbeating of drums was continuous and deafening. Each dancer danced until\r\nexhausted, and then the others shot him with blunt arrows; whereupon he\r\nwas dragged to one side, and theoretically skinned and cut up. Other\r\ndancers replaced those thus removed, and the dance was kept up until\r\nbuffalo came. Sometimes the Sioux out on the prairie put on buffalo\r\nhides and decoyed the villagers forth to be ambushed.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony of the rain makers was another that was always effective\r\nbecause it was continued until the desired results were achieved.\r\nEvidently there were droughts in those days, too, and the fields of\r\nMandan corn withered in the hot summer suns. Catlin tells the story\r\nof one rain maker, who, mounting his lodge and vaunting his powers,\r\ncalled upon the clouds to bring rain. Just as he was about to retire\r\nin failure and disgrace, out of a clear sky came apparent thunder.\r\nThe sound, however, turned out to be a salute fired by the steamer\r\n_Yellowstone_ on her first trip up the Missouri. At first nonplussed,\r\nthe rain maker finally made capital out of this coincidence when, later\r\nin the day, a large cloud jutted up on the horizon, and a heavy rain\r\nbegan and continued far into the night.\r\n\r\nThe council might have been considering also the conducting of the\r\nyearly feast of Okeepa, the most important of all Mandan ceremonies.\r\nThis centered about the legend of the Ark and the First Man, and was\r\nregarded as being an essential part of the origin and existence of the\r\ntribe. It took place in the summertime, usually lasting about four days.\r\n\r\nThe feast of Okeepa contained many features common to the sun dance\r\nof the other Plains tribes, particularly the element of self-torture.\r\nSkewers were thrust through the loose flesh of the dancer's chest,\r\nthongs attached, and the dancer thereby hauled up toward the roof\r\nof the council lodge until his body was six or eight feet off the\r\nground. Often other skewers were thrust through the skin of the back,\r\nand weights attached by thongs and allowed to drag over the floor of\r\nthe lodge as the dancer swung about the pole. Thus suspended, the\r\nwarrior boasted of his prowess and bravery until he was released by the\r\nbreaking of the flesh. This torture was thought necessary to secure the\r\nblessings of food, shelter, protection from enemies, and long life.\r\n\r\nWhile the hunters were away, some of the women, engaged in the\r\nimmemorial food-getting practice of fishing, went out on the river in\r\nthe tublike bullboat--so-called because it was made from the skin of a\r\nsingle buffalo bull, stretched over a willow frame. Others went along\r\nthe bluffs and through the valleys, digging tipsin roots, and gathering\r\nberries, cherries, and plums.\r\n\r\nBut probably by far their most important occupation economically was\r\ntheir work in the gardens. As far back as their traditions go, the\r\ntribes of the Missouri Valley seem to have been agriculturists. Along\r\nthe river each family kept a field or garden, variously estimated at\r\nfrom one to four or five acres in size. These fields were held by the\r\nfamily with a sort of perpetual lease from the community, the term\r\nof the lease being dependent only on the condition that good use be\r\nmade of the land. There was apparently no concept of the white man's\r\npractice of fertilizing the soil; when an old field grew impoverished,\r\na new one was selected. A fence of forked sticks protected the crops\r\nfrom horses, while here and there on the outskirts of the fields a\r\nsentry brave was on duty to guard the women from the ever dreaded\r\nSioux. Aiding the women were a few old men, too feeble for the chase.\r\nA variety of tobacco, several varieties of sunflowers, squashes,\r\npumpkins, and beans, and a dozen varieties of corn grew in the gardens.\r\nEarly travelers say the ears of corn were extraordinarily small.\r\n\r\nThe keepers of the gardens were very faithful in caring for the growing\r\nplants, and took great pride in keeping the soil free from weeds. They\r\nworked among the corn with the willow rake, the antler fork, and,\r\nprobably most important of all, the shoulderblade hoe. In each garden\r\nstood a platform or watchtower upon which in certain seasons sat one or\r\ntwo Indian women, whose duty it was to frighten away marauding crows\r\nand blackbirds. These women also sang watchtower songs to the growing\r\ncorn, as a mother sings to her babe.\r\n\r\nWhen the hunters and the berry pickers and the gardeners returned home,\r\nsurplus corn, meat, squashes, and other foods were placed on the drying\r\nracks which stood at the doors of the lodges. Corn that was allowed to\r\nripen was usually stored in underground bottle-shaped caches or storage\r\npits, the best ears being placed around the edges of the cache, while\r\nin the center were thrown loose corn and strings of dried squash.\r\n\r\nAs evening came on, within the dome-shaped lodges there was much\r\nfeasting, especially if it was the time of the new corn. The doorway of\r\na lodge was protected by a kind of porch and hung with a buffalo hide.\r\nFrom behind the windshield just inside the doorway shone the light of\r\nthe fire, which was built in a stone-lined depression in the center\r\nof the lodge, with a hole in the roof to carry off the smoke. This\r\nopening also served as a skylight. To the right of the doorway, in a\r\nsmall corral or stall, were the favorite ponies, safely confined for\r\nthe night. Boxlike beds for the master of the house, his wife or wives,\r\nand his children, were arranged along the wall on the other side. These\r\nwere made by covering sturdy wooden frames with hides. In the rear\r\nstood an altar--a tall hide-covered structure somewhat resembling a\r\ncanopied chair--in which were placed all the sacred objects and most\r\nprized possessions of the head of the house. Over the fire about which\r\nthe family or families had gathered--usually two or three families and\r\ntheir relatives lived in one lodge--were kettles of food cooking for\r\nthe evening meal. Catlin says the Indians ate whenever hungry, or about\r\ntwice a day. The pot was kept boiling, and each one helped himself.\r\nAnyone in the village who was hungry was free to go into any lodge and\r\nsatisfy his hunger, although the lazy and improvident were scorned.\r\n\r\nOverhead, the light from the fire flickered on the huge supporting\r\nuprights of the lodge, where hung articles of clothing, tools from the\r\ngarden, and weapons for war and hunting. Months before, with infinite\r\nlabor and no little ingenuity, and hampered by the imperfections of\r\nthe crude tools and equipment at their command, these early Dakota\r\nfarmers had cut great cottonwood logs from the Missouri bottomlands and\r\ndragged them to the top of the bluffs, to form the framework for this\r\nearthen home. The lodges varied from 30 to 90 feet in diameter. After a\r\nlittle sod had been removed from a space of the desired size, to form\r\na smooth, firm floor, four heavy posts were fixed upright not far from\r\nthe center, to support the great roof, while at some distance out from\r\nthese a circle of smaller posts was set to hold up the sides. Rafters\r\nof moderate-sized timbers were placed over these supports, after which\r\nthe whole was overlaid with willows, hay, and earth--a humble covering\r\nthat guarded with all its passive, effective impenetrability against\r\nboth the sweltering heat of summer and the intense cold of winter.\r\n\r\nOut on the prairies, sometimes along the shores of rivers or lakes,\r\nsometimes on the open plain, stood the tipi villages of the enemy--the\r\nnomadic Assiniboin and Sioux. Against the evening sky the tipis, which\r\nrequired about 15 buffalo hides each in their construction, rose as\r\nmuch as 25 feet in height. A tipi approximately 15 feet in diameter\r\nusually accommodated two families.\r\n\r\nNot far from the village, and very carefully guarded, grazed the pony\r\nherd. The horse was of great importance in the nomadic way of living.\r\nHe carried the tipi and its contents across the plains and sped the\r\nhunters in their pursuit of the buffalo. Every warrior had two, some\r\nmany more; and Sioux horsemen were probably as daring and expert as any\r\nthe world has known.\r\n\r\nThe serviceability of the horse was increased by the use of the\r\ntravois, a simple implement of transportation consisting of two long\r\npoles, often tipi poles, whose forward ends, joined by a short strap,\r\nrested on the animal's neck, while the rear ends dragged along the\r\nprairie. Camp duffle was strapped to the middle of the poles. A similar\r\nbut smaller device was placed on dogs.\r\n\r\nGathered about the campfires were the warriors, men of striking\r\nphysique and strong character, perhaps just in from the chase or war\r\nor a pillaging expedition. The clothing of the nomadic tribes was more\r\nextensive than that of the agricultural. Moccasins, separate trouser\r\nlegs, breechcloth, and leather shirt were supplemented in cold weather\r\nby buffalo robes. The women wore moccasins, short decorated leggings,\r\nand loose-fitting leather dresses falling to the knees. In winter\r\nboth sexes wore a kind of hood over the head. Clothing was commonly\r\nornamented with bead and quill work.\r\n\r\nHere and there about the tipis hung bows with quivers of arrows. As in\r\nthe case of the agricultural tribes, the bow and arrow was the chief\r\nweapon, and the Sioux were expert in its use. Ready to hand, too, were\r\nshields, clubs, stone hammers, and spears. It is interesting to note\r\nhere that as a means of communication in peace and war the tribes\r\nmade good use of the art of signaling with fires and smoke. By this\r\nmethod messages were transmitted long distances with almost incredible\r\nrapidity.\r\n\r\nNot far from the fires some of the women were preparing for drying\r\nthe buffalo meat brought in from the chase. Others were storing dried\r\nberries and fruits in caches, in the making and concealing of which the\r\nSioux were very skillful.\r\n\r\nAbout the big fire near the center of the village the old men and\r\nchiefs were meeting in council over some weighty matter, perhaps the\r\narrangements for the great annual sun dance. For this a special lodge\r\nwas prepared on the prairie, around which the whole village pitched its\r\ncamp in the form of a horseshoe facing the east. The ceremony required\r\nseveral days and involved self-torture similar to that of the Mandan\r\nfeast of Okeepa.\r\n\r\nIn one group about the fire an elderly man was relating the history\r\nof the tribe to a circle of youthful faces. Some of the tribes kept a\r\nchronicle of their history by means of the winter count: the council\r\nmet in winter and decided on the outstanding event of the year;\r\nthereafter the year was designated by this event, which was often\r\npictured symbolically on a buffalo hide.\r\n\r\nWith the history, of course, as the evening stars came out, were\r\nmingled fancy and legend. On this night the boys and girls heard of\r\nthe great monster who breaks up the ice in the Missouri each spring,\r\nof how one of the goose nation was shown in a dream that her people\r\nshould go south each autumn in order to avoid the harsh winter, and\r\nof the Iktomi, the little \"spidermen,\" who on moonlight nights, high\r\non hilltops, can be heard with their tiny hammers, shaping arrowheads\r\nwhich they place in piles where Indians can find them.\r\n\r\nOne of the Iktomi, who was a very excellent singer and dancer, was\r\nhungry, continued the storyteller, and went into the woods to catch\r\nsome birds. Being unsuccessful in his attempts to bag them, he invited\r\nthem into his house to hear him sing. After they had accepted his\r\ninvitation, he told them that if they were to hear his sweet voice,\r\nthey must keep their eyes closed tightly. He warned them that their\r\neyes would turn to a blood red if they opened them. Then he sang and\r\ndanced. In his dance, however, as he passed each bird, he took it by\r\nthe head and wrung its neck. This continued until he came to Siyaka,\r\nthe duck. Siyaka opened his eyes just as the Iktomi seized him, and\r\nmanaged to break away. But where the Iktomi had his hand about his neck\r\nthere was a red ring which is there to this day, and Siyaka is now the\r\nring-necked duck.\r\n\r\nThe thunderbirds, so ran another tale of the aged storyteller, live\r\nsuspended between heaven and earth, their wings supported by lightning.\r\nAbove are the dark clouds. Below is the earth. When the thunderbirds\r\nshake their wings favorably, it rains. There was a time when they tired\r\nof living between heaven and earth, and asked the Great Mystery if\r\nthey might become men and live on earth. This the Great Mystery gave\r\nthem permission to do, but told them that they should become men such\r\nas no other men were. Accordingly, they became giants so large that\r\none living on the Big Muddy could reach the Atlantic Ocean in a single\r\nstep. One of them playfully took up a handful of earth, and the waters\r\nflowing into the depression formed Lake Superior, while the handful of\r\nearth which he tossed aside made a mountain. They dug a ditch to the\r\nGulf of Mexico, and it is now called the Mississippi River. Such antics\r\nfinally produced all the lakes and rivers. At last the thunderbird\r\nmen grew old and died, and went back to the spaces between heaven\r\nand earth. Lightning is the fire from their eyes, and thunder the\r\nreverberation from their eggs as they hatch.\r\n\r\nWhile the night settled darker and a breath of cool air stole in from\r\nthe prairie, the storyteller told of the great giant who lives in the\r\nNorth and whose name is Wasiya. The feathers of his bonnet are icicles,\r\nand his clothing is of ice. When he blows his breath, it turns cold and\r\nwinter comes.\r\n\r\nLater, as strange lights began to play far away in the northern sky,\r\nthe narrator told the story, heard from the Chippewa, of the Northern\r\nLights. A woman in a dream once visited the land where these lights\r\nshine, and discovered that they are ghosts rising and falling in the\r\nsteps of a dance. All the women wear gay colors, and the warriors\r\nbrandish their war clubs.\r\n\r\nThe boys and girls heard, too, of the beautiful Indian maiden who came\r\nfrom the land of the setting sun and brought the Sioux the pipe of\r\nstrange red stone, which is the solidified blood of Indians. She told\r\nthem to use the pipe only when there is peace, or peace to be made, and\r\nin times of sickness and distress; and urged them to be kind to the\r\nwomen because they are weak. She is now the morning star, the Indians'\r\nsister, and stands in the heavens, wearing a white buffalo robe. The\r\nboys and girls were told, too, as the darkness deepened out on the\r\nprairies, that the earth is the Indians' Mother, and the sun their\r\nFather. Therefore, they should treat kindly and with reverence all\r\nthings in earth and sky, because they are manifestations of Wakantanka,\r\nthe Great Mystery, or the Great Spirit, to whom the Indians pray.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECLINE OF THE INDIAN TRIBES\r\n\r\nShortly after the Verendrye visit the Mandan seem to have declined.\r\nWhen Lewis and Clark came up the Missouri in 1804, the villages about\r\nthe Heart River were in ruins. Farther up the river, near where it is\r\njoined by the Knife, the explorers found the Mandan, diminished by\r\nsmallpox and by wars with the Assiniboin and the Dakota to two small\r\nvillages. In 1837 smallpox again broke out, reducing the tribe from\r\n1,600 to 150--some travelers give even a lower figure. At the beginning\r\nof the twentieth century it numbered about 250.\r\n\r\nThe other agricultural tribes seem to have suffered fates almost as\r\nharsh. The Hidatsa, numbering 2,100 at the time of the Lewis and Clark\r\nvisit, had been reduced at the beginning of the present century to\r\nless than 500. In 1804 the Arikara, crowded by the Sioux, had moved\r\nup the river nearer to the other agricultural tribes. Lewis and Clark\r\nfound them in three villages between the Grand and Cannonball Rivers in\r\nwhat is now North and South Dakota. At that time they numbered 2,600,\r\nbut this figure had dropped to 380 by the beginning of the twentieth\r\ncentury. The Cheyenne village on the Missouri, some distance below\r\nthe site of Bismarck, was in ruins at the time of the expedition.\r\nSuccessive migrations finally brought the Cheyenne to the headwaters of\r\nthe Cheyenne River in the southwestern part of present South Dakota.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural tribes on the whole have been very friendly to the\r\nwhites. In 1870 a large reservation, which has since been much reduced\r\nin size, was set apart at the junction of the Missouri and the Little\r\nMissouri Rivers for the Mandan, Arikara, and Hidatsa (_see Side Tour\r\n3A_). Since the beginning of the century their numbers have increased\r\nby large percentages and at the present time they number approximately\r\n1,650. The remnant of those Cheyenne who lived in North Dakota are now\r\non reservations in south central Montana and in Oklahoma.\r\n\r\nThe nomadic tribes, especially the Sioux, did not take as kindly\r\nto the white invasion as did the agricultural groups. However, the\r\nprincipal disturbances involving this tribe--the Minnesota Massacre of\r\n1862, which extended to Abercrombie within the limits of present North\r\nDakota; Sibley's campaign to the Missouri in 1863; Sully's expeditions\r\ninto Dakota in 1863-64; and the battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876,\r\nwhen Gen. George A. Custer and five companies of cavalry were wiped\r\nout--none of these major conflicts involved the Sioux as a whole,\r\nbut rather one or more of the seven Council Fires, as they call their\r\ntribal divisions. These seven groups are the Mdewakanton, Wahpekute,\r\nSisseton, and Wahpeton, who inhabited the region about Lake Traverse\r\nand the Big Sioux River and east to the Mississippi; the Yankton and\r\nYanktonai, who lived along the course of the James River; and the\r\nTeton, who dwelt west of the Missouri. The four Council Fires first\r\nnamed were responsible for the uprising and massacre in Minnesota in\r\n1862, in which about 400 settlers and 100 white soldiers lost their\r\nlives. Sibley and Sully were sent into Dakota Territory in 1863-64 to\r\npunish the perpetrators of this massacre, but although they punished\r\nSioux, they probably did not punish the offending bands (_see_ HISTORY).\r\n\r\nWhile all the Sioux were bitter in their objection to the whites,\r\nit was the Teton, or prairie Sioux, whose seven bands constituted\r\nmore than one-half the tribe, who were the most unremitting in their\r\nhostility. These bands were the Ogallala, Brulé, Hunkpapa, Blackfeet,\r\nMinneconjou, Sans Arcs, and Two Kettle. Of these the Hunkpapa and\r\nOgallala were the most numerous. They were also probably the most\r\ninflexible in their determination not to yield to white sovereignty,\r\nand formed the backbone of the Indian opposition in the disasters at\r\nFort Phil Kearney in Wyoming and at the Little Big Horn in Montana.\r\n\r\nThe other North Dakota nomadic tribes did not give the newcomers as\r\nmuch trouble as did the Sioux. The Assiniboin were a wandering people,\r\nless certain of fixed habitation than the Sioux and Chippewa. In spite\r\nof the uncertainty of their lives and their constant warfare with the\r\nSioux, in the early part of the nineteenth century they numbered about\r\n1,200 lodges. Not long afterward they were reduced by a plague of\r\nsmallpox to less than 400 lodges.\r\n\r\nThe Chippewa made a treaty with the Government in 1815 after the\r\nborder troubles incident to the War of 1812, and have since remained\r\npeaceful, almost all residing on reservations or allotted lands within\r\ntheir original territory in Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and North\r\nDakota. At the close of the eighteenth century there were perhaps\r\n25,000 Chippewa, while at the beginning of the twentieth there were in\r\nthe neighborhood of 30,000, approximately 1,000 of whom were in North\r\nDakota.\r\n\r\nThe nomadic tribes now living in North Dakota are on three\r\nreservations. Nearly 1,000 Sioux are at Fort Totten (_see Side Tour\r\n6A_), while Standing Rock (_see Side Tour 8C_) has about 1,600\r\non the North Dakota side. Six thousand three hundred thirty-four\r\nChippewas, most of whom are of mixed blood, live on the Turtle Mountain\r\nReservation (_see Tour 5_). The members of the Assiniboin tribe now\r\nlive on reservations in Montana and Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTH DAKOTA INDIAN TRIBES TODAY\r\n\r\nPresent-day North Dakota Indian life offers a vastly different picture\r\nfrom that which the Verendryes saw in 1738, or that which three-fourths\r\nof a century later presented itself to Lewis and Clark. The lives of\r\nthe groups on the various reservations bear many points in common. They\r\nhave all been brought very quickly from the age of stone and thrust\r\nprecipitately into the bright light of the modern world. They are all\r\nsurvivors of Indian nations whose ranges once extended from the forests\r\nof the Great Lakes to the Rockies, and from the prairies of western\r\nCanada to the Platte. Now on much restricted areas and amid a complex\r\nand alien culture they are endeavoring to build homes and rear children\r\nin a manner that will at once accord with the limitations set by the\r\ndominant white race, and yet retain what they feel is worthy in their\r\nown cultures and traditions.\r\n\r\nIn spite of these fundamental similarities the material life of the\r\nIndians on the various reserves presents not only a mingling of white\r\nand Indian cultures, but also somewhat wide differences in economic\r\nstatus. With the exception of that done at Fort Berthold little farming\r\nis carried on, a situation not generally due to lack of land; while\r\nmore than 6,000 Indians at Turtle Mountain are crowded into 72 square\r\nmiles, and while the present homes of all of the tribes are rather\r\ninfinitesimal in comparison with their former wide ranges, most of them\r\ndo not lack space for farming. However, particularly at Standing Rock,\r\na certain antipathy for the white man's settled mode of life, coupled\r\nwith semiarid conditions unfavorable to agriculture, have discouraged\r\nefforts along that line.\r\n\r\nThe land has been allotted in severalty for the most part, and the\r\nconcept of individual ownership has in general been adopted, although\r\nthere is a movement in the Standing Rock area to return to the communal\r\nform. A small amount of grazing and timber land is held tribally at\r\nFort Berthold and Standing Rock, and the latter reservation has a\r\ntribal herd of 1,500 cattle. Much Indian land is rented to whites for\r\ngrazing or farming.\r\n\r\nThe relatively superior economic situation of the Fort Berthold\r\nIndians is doubtless due to the ancient agrarian background of the\r\ntribe. Long centuries of farming fitted them for ready adjustment\r\nto the agricultural life of the reservation. A general view of the\r\nfarming section of their area presents an aspect not greatly unlike\r\nthat of any other farming section in a similar territory. While many\r\nof them live in log houses of two to four rooms, others live in better\r\nbuildings than those of the average rural district. Homes on the other\r\nreservations vary from primitive shacks and log cabins to modern\r\ndwellings, and are usually clustered about agencies or subagencies.\r\nIn summertime many of the Indians, showing a longing for the old tipi\r\nlife, live in tents placed in their yards, and cook over open fires.\r\nWikiups, improvised shelters of willows, are also used in fair weather.\r\n\r\nAlthough the primitive food-gathering methods of hunting and fishing\r\nhave no great economic value at the present time, the Indians still\r\nmake use of their traditional knowledge of certain native foods and\r\nsimple ways of preserving them. They dry much of their food, especially\r\nmeat and vegetables. Among the Fort Berthold Indians one may still be\r\noffered pemmican, corn balls, butter from marrow, sausage, and tripe.\r\nMint and balm leaves for tea, chokecherries, berries, red bean and\r\ntipsin roots, and wild onions, artichokes, and plums are still added\r\nto the larder. Rattlesnake oil, skunk oil, sweet grass, cedar tree\r\nneedles, and wild sage are used as medicines. In addition the Sioux at\r\nStanding Rock make _wakmiza wasna_ by pounding corn meal and raisins\r\ninto beef tallow, and forming the whole into small cakes. _Wojapi_ is\r\nmade of chokecherries, June berries, and flour, and some women add\r\na little sugar to make a kind of pudding. Wild beans are taken from\r\ncaches where they have been stored by mice, the supplies thus removed\r\nalways being replaced with corn. _Kinnikinik_ or _killiklik_, a mixture\r\nused for smoking, is made of dried and shredded red willow bark,\r\nsprinkled with tobacco.\r\n\r\nSome basketry is still made, and most of the Indian groups do tanning\r\nand very good beadwork. Porcupine quills, horse hair, and feathers are\r\nemployed in the designs in embroidery, and elk teeth, shells, colored\r\nclays, and weasel tails are used for adornments. Objects of Indian art\r\nare on display and for sale at the annual fairs on the reservations,\r\nand usually can be purchased at the agencies or subagencies.\r\n\r\nComplicating the struggle for existence for most of the tribes is\r\nthe prevalence of tuberculosis, of which one-third of the people at\r\nStanding Rock are said to be victims. Trachoma also is common. In spite\r\nof these facts, however, the tribes are gaining rapidly in numbers,\r\nwith an average birth rate more than twice as high as the death rate.\r\n\r\nThe Government has sought to aid the Indian in his transition to the\r\nnew culture by giving him a part in the realm of political relations.\r\nAll the reservations have native police, employed by the Government;\r\nand Standing Rock has two Indian police judges, who hear all cases and\r\npass sentence on all minor Indian violations of law. At Turtle Mountain\r\nthere are no Government restrictions in the use of land and stock, and\r\nthe tribe has complete charge of property. All the Indian groups except\r\nthat at Fort Totten have tribal councils, which, while their legal\r\npowers are not great, have considerable weight in an advisory capacity.\r\n\r\nThe acceptance by the tribes of the white man's fundamental educational\r\nprinciple of daily formal schooling has had a large part in their\r\nassimilation. Mission schools established by the various churches\r\nfrequently brought the first formal education to the Indians, and\r\nmost of the groups are still served by such schools. Small and large\r\nGovernment schools have been provided to give the Indian child the same\r\neducational opportunity as that afforded the white. Fort Totten and\r\nTurtle Mountain both have consolidated Indian schools, and a boarding\r\nschool offering high school work is maintained at Wahpeton.\r\n\r\nIn spite of their work in these schools and the fact that they are\r\nfast becoming fluent speakers of English, in most instances the\r\nIndians are retaining their native tongues. An exception to this is at\r\nTurtle Mountain, where due to intermarriage of French and Indian the\r\nAlgonquian mother tongue of the Chippewa is dying out.\r\n\r\nWhile doubtless many ancient habits and customs are retained, such as\r\nthose pertaining to marriage, formal tribal ceremonies do not appear to\r\nbe conducted to any great extent at the present time. Marriage assumes\r\nthe Christian form, and the Christian religion has been generally\r\nadopted, with the Catholic, Episcopalian, and Congregational faiths\r\nmost commonly represented. The ancient tribal religions still exert\r\na powerful influence, however--a fact especially evident at such\r\ntimes as the performance of the annual Arikara ceremonies on the Fort\r\nBerthold Reservation and the yearly sun dance of the Chippewa at Turtle\r\nMountain. The large sun dance held at Little Eagle in South Dakota in\r\n1936 by the Sioux of the Standing Rock Agency was the first conducted\r\nby that tribe in more than 50 years.\r\n\r\nThe Indians often participate in the social dances, such as the Omaha\r\ngrass dance, the rabbit dance, and the hoop dance; and dancing in\r\nnative costume can be seen occasionally, particularly during Fourth of\r\nJuly celebrations and at the annual fairs. The latter are held on most\r\nof the reservations some time in September and October. Music for the\r\nstrictly Indian dancing consists of singing accompanied by drums--the\r\nsmall Indian hand drums or tom-toms, and the white man's big bass drum.\r\nFormerly a large drum of Indian manufacture was used; and rattles,\r\nstring bells, and flutelike whistles are still made.\r\n\r\nA great many group activities center at the schools and churches,\r\nwhere take place the usual athletic, social, and religious events and\r\ngatherings found in white communities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Atlantic seaboard Colonies still constituted the American frontier\r\non the April day in 1682 when the intrepid Sieur de la Salle, in the\r\npresence of a company of uncomprehending red men, took possession of\r\nthe lands drained by the Mississippi River \"in the name of the Most\r\nHigh, Mighty, Invincible, and Victorious Prince, Louis the Great, by\r\nthe Grace of God, King of France and Navarre, Fourteenth of that name.\"\r\n\r\nHis words figuratively raised the flag of France over a vast territory\r\nwhich included more than half of what is now North Dakota. Two other\r\nEuropean nations were to own parts of this State, and it was to be\r\nidentified with nine United States Territories before actually becoming\r\na member of the Union in 1889.\r\n\r\nLa Salle's _Procès Verbal_ claimed for France the vast lands in the\r\ndrainage basins of the Mississippi and its tributaries. All of this\r\nterritory was ceded to Spain in 1762, to repay her for losses suffered\r\nas an ally of France. Adjustments of territorial possessions having\r\nbeen made between Spain and England, however, France \"suggested\" that\r\nSpain cede back the lands, which she reluctantly did in 1800.\r\n\r\nThe Louisiana Purchase was negotiated in 1803, and the United\r\nStates came into possession of the Mississippi basin, including the\r\nsouthwestern half of North Dakota. The northeastern part of the State,\r\ndrained by the Red and Souris Rivers, was acquired from Great Britain\r\nin 1818, when a treaty fixed the Canadian-United States boundary at the\r\nForty-ninth Parallel.\r\n\r\nAs the growth of the Nation extended westward, this State successively\r\nbecame part of the Louisiana, Great Northwest, Missouri, Michigan,\r\nWisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and finally Dakota Territories.\r\nFor the three years from the formation of Minnesota to the creation\r\nof Dakota Territory, from 1858-61, almost all of the present State\r\nlying east of the Missouri was unorganized territory, without formal\r\ngovernment of any kind.\r\n\r\nDakota Territory extended from the Canadian border to the Forty-third\r\nParallel, and from Minnesota and Iowa to the main ridge of the Rockies.\r\nWhen Wyoming Territory was created in 1868 the present western boundary\r\nof the Dakotas was fixed, and the southern boundary of the Territory\r\nwas settled in 1882. In the general election of 1887 residents voted\r\nthat the Seventh Standard Parallel divide Dakota Territory into two\r\nStates. President Benjamin Harrison signed the bills admitting North\r\nand South Dakota to statehood November 2, 1889: while he signed them,\r\nboth documents were covered except for the signature space, so that it\r\ncan never be known which of the twin Dakotas is the elder.\r\n\r\nThe two States derive their names from the Santee Sioux word _dakota_,\r\nwhich means \"allies.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY WHITE EXPLORERS\r\n\r\nPierre Gaultier de Varennes, Sieur de la Verendrye, was the first\r\nwhite man known to have entered what is now North Dakota. Like so\r\nmany others of his time, Verendrye, a French-Canadian, was in search\r\nof the westward route to India. When the liberal Louis XV came to the\r\nthrone of France he granted Verendrye permission to explore and claim\r\nnew lands for France, in return for which Verendrye was to receive\r\nexclusive fur trading privileges. With a fur monopoly to back him\r\nVerendrye succeeded in obtaining financial support for his venture, and\r\nin 1731 he and his party left Montreal for the explorations which were\r\nto occupy the remainder of his life.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1738 that, having established several forts in what later\r\nbecame Manitoba and Saskatchewan, he decided to visit the Indians\r\ncalled the Mantannes (Mandans), of whom he had heard. Accordingly he\r\njourneyed south and west, past the Pembina and Turtle Mountains, and\r\neventually reached a Mandan village located a day's journey from the\r\nMissouri. Until 1936 this village was believed by historians to have\r\nbeen near Sanish, but in the light of recent discoveries at a site near\r\nMenoken, the latter is now thought by many historians to have been the\r\nvillage visited by the Verendrye party. This theory is substantiated by\r\nthe journal of Verendrye in which he states that he sent his sons to\r\nvisit another village on the Missouri, a day's march distant (_see Tour\r\n8_).\r\n\r\nOf this trip to the Mandans, Verendrye wrote that their village\r\nconsisted of 130 earth lodges, and added, \"Their fortification ...\r\nhas nothing savage about it.\" The people he described as \"of mixed\r\nblood, white and black. The women are rather handsome, particularly\r\nthe light colored ones; some have an abundance of fair hair.\" But\r\nlater he records that he reproved his Assiniboin guides for telling\r\nhim the Mandans were light-colored, and asserted they had lied to him,\r\nwhereupon they said the fair people of whom they spoke wore metal\r\n(armor) and were a summer's journey down the river.\r\n\r\nThe French party left the Mandan chief a lead tablet claiming the land\r\nin the King's name. What became of the tablet is unknown; a similar\r\none, buried by a son of Verendrye on an expedition in 1743, was\r\nunearthed in 1913 at Fort Pierre, S. Dak.\r\n\r\nThis visit of Verendrye to North Dakota was his only trip into the\r\nregion. Two of his sons passed through North Dakota again in 1742, on\r\nwhich expedition they reached either the Black Hills or the Big Horn\r\nMountains. Unable to make any satisfactory progress toward the ocean,\r\nthey returned to their friends the Mandans and thence to Fort la Reine\r\nin Manitoba.\r\n\r\nFifty years elapsed from the visits of the Verendryes to the next\r\nimportant exploration of North Dakota. In November 1797 David Thompson,\r\nan English geographer in the employ of the Hudson's Bay Company, was\r\nsent out to survey the boundary and visit the company posts. It was\r\nan unusually cold winter, and the party suffered intensely during the\r\n68-day journey. They explored along the Assiniboine and Souris Rivers\r\nand the west edge of the Turtle Mountains, then turned southwest to the\r\nMissouri, where they visited the Mandans, and Hidatsa.\r\n\r\nThompson in his journal has given a thorough account of the homes,\r\nmanners, food, dress, and agricultural activities of these Indians. He\r\nnoted that, while their villages were much alike, the Mandans were a\r\nmore courteous and better behaved group. Called \"the greatest practical\r\nland geographer in history,\" Thompson later helped survey the boundary\r\nline between Canada and the United States in accordance with the Treaty\r\nof 1818. In commemoration of his exploration of this State a monument\r\nhas been erected to him, in the shape of a large masonry sphere, at\r\nVerendrye (_see Tour 7_).\r\n\r\nThe same year that Thompson explored central North Dakota, Charles\r\nChaboillez, a fur trader, came to Pembina to establish the first North\r\nWest Company post within the present boundaries of this State. Both\r\nthe Hudson's Bay and the XY Companies established posts in the same\r\nvicinity in 1801, and with three great companies in deadly competition,\r\nlife at Pembina was colorful and dangerous. Excusing their own lack of\r\nscruples on the grounds of competition, the companies bought furs with\r\nliquor, giving rum to the Indians until they agreed to sell or until\r\nthey were too stupefied to know when the pelts were taken from them.\r\n\r\nThree years after the establishment of Chaboillez's post, Alexander\r\nHenry, a partner in the North West Fur Company, built a post on the\r\nRed River near the mouth of Park River, and shortly afterward moved\r\ndown to the mouth of the Pembina. He made frequent trips to the Grandes\r\nFourches (Grand Forks) and established depots there and in the Hair\r\nHills, or Pembina Mountains. On one occasion he made a trip to the\r\nMissouri to visit the Mandans, and his journal says of their farming\r\nmethods: \"The whole view was agreeable and had more the appearance of a\r\ncountry inhabited by a civilized nation than by a set of savages.\"\r\n\r\nLiquor flowed freely at the Henry post. Traders found it profitable to\r\ndeal with Indians who were in a drunken stupor. Henry's journal gives\r\nevidence that brawls were an everyday occurrence. One entry reads:\r\n\"Feb. 9, 1806. Men and women have been drinking a match for three days\r\nand nights, during which it has been drink, fight--drink, fight--drink,\r\nand fight again--guns, axes, and knives their weapons--very\r\ndisagreeable.\" Henry left Pembina in 1808 for the Saskatchewan River.\r\n\r\nAt his post were born North Dakota's first two children of other than\r\nIndian parentage. The first, the daughter of Pierre Bonza, Henry's\r\nNegro servant, who had formerly been a slave in the West Indies, was\r\nborn March 12, 1802.\r\n\r\nThe first white child was born December 29, 1807, to the \"Orkney Lad\",\r\na woman who had worked at the post for several years in the guise of\r\na man, until the birth of the child betrayed her sex. Abandoned by\r\nthe father of the child, John Scart, she remained at the post until a\r\ncollection was taken up and she and the baby sent back to her home in\r\nthe Orkney Islands.\r\n\r\nPresident Jefferson for some time had been eager to have a party\r\nexplore the Missouri, cross the Rockies and reach the Pacific. In 1803\r\nthe Louisiana Purchase facilitated completion of his plans, and his\r\nsecretary, Capt. Meriwether Lewis, with a friend, Capt. William Clark,\r\nstarted out on the journey of exploration.\r\n\r\nOn October 13, 1804, the expedition came up the Missouri River into\r\nwhat is now North Dakota. Near the present site of Stanton, where the\r\nKnife River joins the Missouri, Lewis and Clark discovered villages\r\nof the Mandans and Hidatsa. Having been well received, they decided\r\nto establish winter quarters. Fort Mandan was built and the flag\r\nof the United States of America raised for the first time on North\r\nDakota soil. It was here that the explorers secured the services of\r\nCharbonneau, the French interpreter, and his wife Sakakawea, the\r\nShoshone Indian girl who guided them successfully through the Rockies\r\nto the Pacific (_see_ BISMARCK).\r\n\r\nAfter spending the winter with the friendly Indians, the expedition in\r\nApril 1805 set out along the river again, following its course into\r\nMontana. Their journey through the mountains to the Pacific, led by\r\nSakakawea, is one of the most thrilling adventures in American history.\r\n\r\nThe party returned in September 1806 to the Hidatsa village on the\r\nMissouri where Lewis and Clark, taking leave of their faithful guide,\r\nset out for St. Louis and home. The careful observations recorded in\r\nthe journals of their party are a valuable contribution to the history\r\nof this region.\r\n\r\nLewis and Clark were not the only explorers to visit the Missouri\r\nregion in the early nineteenth century. A decade before they came\r\ntraders were already ascending the river, and in the succeeding year\r\nnaturalists and military men added their presence to the growing,\r\nif transient, white population. Among the many who left interesting\r\nrecords of their explorations and travels were Charles le Raye, who\r\nspent three years as a captive of the Brulé Sioux; Manuel Lisa,\r\none of the most important fur traders on the upper Missouri; Gen.\r\nWilliam Ashley, Col. Henry Leavenworth, and Gen. Henry Atkinson, who\r\nsubdued the Arikara; and Wilson P. Hunt of the Astorian Overland\r\nExpedition. Two royal adventurers visited here: Paul Wilhelm, Prince of\r\nWurttemberg, who is said to have taken Sakakawea's son back to Germany\r\nwith him; and Maximilian, Prince of Wied, who brought with him the\r\nSwiss artist Carl Bodmer, whose paintings preserve much of the life and\r\ncustoms of the Mandans. George Catlin, a native artist, was aboard the\r\nfirst steamboat to reach the Yellowstone. He painted and wrote about\r\nthe Missouri Indians, and left hundreds of pictures of their life. John\r\nJames Audubon, noted naturalist, spent several months in present North\r\nDakota studying the larger types of North American mammals.\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE FRONTIER\r\n\r\nThe earliest attempt at colonization in this State was the Selkirk\r\nsettlement in 1812 at Pembina in the Red River Valley. The Earl of\r\nSelkirk had arranged for the transportation of a group of evicted\r\nScotch and Irish peasants to the Hudson Bay region in Canada, and\r\nsome of the emigrants had followed the Red River south and settled at\r\nPembina. The fur traders in that vicinity, however, were not eager\r\nto have the wild country inhabited. They made life miserable for\r\nthe Selkirk settlers, and finally succeeded in driving most of the\r\nnewcomers out.\r\n\r\nAmong the fur companies of that time were two famous competitors, the\r\nHudson's Bay and the North West Companies. Others were the Missouri Fur\r\nCompany, Chouteau and Berthold, Northwestern, Columbia, and Sublette\r\n& Campbell, the latter company establishing a post, Fort William, on\r\nthe site later occupied by Fort Buford military post. John Jacob Astor\r\nestablished the American Fur Company, and for years Fort Union, on\r\nNorth Dakota's western border, was that company's principal post. (_See\r\nSide Tour 6B._)\r\n\r\nSome of northeastern North Dakota's most noted pioneers came into\r\nthis region as fur traders. Joseph Rolette was sent to Pembina by the\r\nAmerican Fur Company in 1842. A member of the Minnesota Territorial\r\nLegislature, he was responsible for keeping the capital at St. Paul.\r\nNorman Kittson, who established a fur trading post at Pembina in 1843,\r\nbecame the first postmaster, in 1851, in what is now North Dakota. He,\r\ntoo, was a member of the Minnesota Territorial Legislature. Charles\r\nCavileer, while not a fur trader, was a contemporary of these men, and\r\nacted as collector of customs at Pembina.\r\n\r\nThe coming of settlers marked the decline of the fur trade, but at its\r\nheight it had been colorful. Lewis Crawford, a North Dakota historian,\r\nhas written:\r\n\r\n  \"In this early race for empire none except fur seekers entered.\r\n  Their rhythmic paddle blades swished up every stream of the West to\r\n  its rivulet head; every mountain height and forbidding gorge knew\r\n  their intrepid feet.... Every nationality had a part.... These were\r\n  the true pathfinders, the true explorers, the heralds of empire.\r\n  Their fur-laden vessels floating down the familiar waters of the\r\n  Missouri and its tributaries represented the wealth, the adventure,\r\n  the romance of the Northwest.\"\r\n\r\nIn the time of the fur trader the Missouri River, the \"Smoky Water\" of\r\nthe Indians, was navigable, though as turbulent and capricious as it is\r\ntoday. It was the highway of the trader and later of the gold seeker.\r\nThe first steamboat to navigate the Missouri through North Dakota was\r\nthe _Yellowstone_, which in 1832 ascended the river to Fort Union. To\r\noperate a boat on this river required great skill.\r\n\r\nFamous pilots in the heyday of the steamboat who wrestled with the\r\nwiles of the Missouri included Joseph LaBarge, Grant Marsh, and C. J.\r\nAtkins. In 63 years as a pilot Grant Marsh wrecked but one boat on the\r\nMississippi and never had a wreck on the Missouri or Yellowstone.\r\n\r\nThe yellow gleam of gold, discovered in Montana in 1863 and 1864,\r\ndrew a rush of prospectors. The railroads had not yet penetrated\r\nthis territory, and the Missouri was the pathway to the gold fields.\r\nPrecious cargoes of yellow dust floated down through Dakota, bound for\r\nSt. Louis. It is said that one boat, the _Luella_, carried gold dust to\r\nthe value of $1,250,000 down the river in 1866.\r\n\r\nIt was not the coming of the railroads to Bismarck in 1873 that marked\r\nthe decline of the steamboat on the Missouri, but rather the extension\r\nof the railroad westward to Montana in 1883.\r\n\r\nThe Red River of the North was the important channel of traffic for\r\nnortheastern North Dakota. Steamboats were not as numerous as they were\r\non the Missouri, nor were they operated at such an early date. Fleets\r\nof barges and scows were used to transport provisions. The steamer\r\n_Selkirk_ commanded by Capt. Alexander Griggs, best known of Red River\r\npilots, brought passengers down the river to settle at Grand Forks the\r\nyear after he and his crew had unexpectedly spent the winter there\r\n(_see_ GRAND FORKS).\r\n\r\nIn Territorial days United States military posts were numerous but\r\nshort-lived. Fort Abercrombie on the west bank of the Red River, about\r\n12 miles north of the site of Wahpeton, was established in 1857.\r\nSupplies for this post were brought from St. Paul. When the Sioux went\r\non the warpath in 1862, Minnesota settlers sought refuge here during a\r\nseven weeks' siege. The fort was abandoned in 1877 (_see Tour 1_).\r\n\r\nFort Rice, on the west bank of the Missouri, came next. Gen. Alfred\r\nH. Sully's men cut cottonwood trees to build it in 1864. The fort\r\nhoused four infantry companies. It was to Fort Rice in 1870 that Linda\r\nSlaughter, young, talented, followed her husband, Dr. Frank Slaughter.\r\nHer writings, depicting the frontier life, found their way into many\r\neastern papers, and today constitute some of the best material on that\r\nera of State history. At Fort Rice she buried her first-born child,\r\nher only son, in the bitter cold of January. She heard the arrows of\r\nhostile Indians whizzing dangerously near. Her luxuriant hair, which\r\nshe always wore long over her shoulders, was coveted as a scalp lock,\r\nand she came near leaving it with the red men on one of her horseback\r\njaunts from the fort. A woman who could paint, write, or lecture at\r\nwill, she could also cook or nurse as the occasion demanded. In later\r\ndays she wrote the first telegram that was sent to the world from\r\nEdwinton, the village which became Bismarck.\r\n\r\nFort Rice was dismantled in 1878 when Fort Yates, to the south, took\r\nits place. Fort Ransom on the Sheyenne was established in 1867. In\r\n1872 Fort Seward, first called Fort Cross, was built at Jamestown. The\r\nmilitary reservations of Fort Abercrombie and Fort Seward were opened\r\nto homestead entry in 1880.\r\n\r\nFort Totten, near Devils Lake, was constructed in 1867 and served until\r\n1890, when the buildings were turned over to the Indian school. Fort\r\nStevenson on the Missouri at the mouth of Douglas Creek was maintained\r\nfrom 1867-83. Fort Buford was built in 1866 opposite the mouth of the\r\nYellowstone on the north bank of the Missouri. After his surrender\r\nin 1877 Chief Joseph was taken through Fort Buford en route to Fort\r\nLeavenworth, Kans., and Chiefs Gall and Sitting Bull went there to\r\nsurrender after their escape into Canada (_see Side Tour 6B_). The fort\r\nexisted officially until 1895, but sometime before its abandonment the\r\ngarrison had been transferred to Fort Assiniboine in Montana.\r\n\r\nEstablished on the Red River near the site of Pembina, Fort Pembina\r\nwas maintained from 1870 to 1895. Fort McKeen, established in 1872,\r\nbecame, the same year, part of Fort Abraham Lincoln, garrisoned until\r\n1891. It was from Fort Abraham Lincoln that Custer and his Seventh\r\nCavalry marched to death and disaster on the banks of the Little Big\r\nHorn in 1876 (_see_ FORT ABRAHAM LINCOLN STATE PARK). After 25 years of\r\noccupation, Fort Yates was abandoned in 1903, when the new Fort Lincoln\r\nwas built near Bismarck with facilities for four companies of infantry\r\nand supporting detachments. (_See Tour 8._)\r\n\r\nThese early forts were established to protect the settlers along the\r\nfrontier and to keep the Indians in order. It was after the Sioux\r\noutbreak in Minnesota in 1862 that Gen. Henry H. Sibley was sent\r\nto punish the Sioux. In June of 1863 he headed his army west from\r\nMinnesota toward the Devil's Lake region, where he arrived to find the\r\nIndians had gone south. He pursued them and on July 24 engaged them\r\nin battle at Big Mound about seven miles north of the present town of\r\nTappen. They retreated, and he followed them to Dead Buffalo Lake,\r\nnorthwest of Dawson, where July 26 another engagement was fought. Two\r\ndays later he met them again at Stony Lake northeast of Driscoll, but\r\nthe Sioux retreated rapidly and there was no fighting. Moving on toward\r\nthe Missouri, Sibley encamped on Apple Creek, seven miles east of the\r\npresent site of Bismarck, and again near its mouth. The Sioux fled\r\nacross the river.\r\n\r\nSibley, all along the route, had thrown up defensive earthworks at each\r\nof his camps. All of these camp sites which were not plowed under have\r\nbeen definitely located under direction of the State historical society.\r\n\r\nGen. Alfred H. Sully was to have met Sibley on the Missouri, but no\r\ncontact could be made and Sibley set out for Minnesota on August 1,\r\n1863. Sully came up the river from Sioux City, and was near Long Lake\r\nwhen he learned that Sibley had gone home and the Sioux had recrossed\r\nthe Missouri and departed for the James River. Sully gave chase--he had\r\nbeen sent out to fight Indians, and fight them he would. The Battle of\r\nWhitestone Hill, near Ellendale, followed. Whether the Indians Sully\r\nfought had taken part in the Minnesota uprising is today regarded as\r\ndubious, but the battle is said to have been the fiercest ever fought\r\non North Dakota soil. The field is now marked by a monument of a\r\ncavalry trooper (_see Tour 2_).\r\n\r\nSully returned to Sioux City but was sent back the following year to\r\ndeal out still more punishment to the Sioux. After Fort Rice had been\r\nestablished a scouting detachment was sent after the evasive red men,\r\nand soon reported Sioux near Killdeer Mountain. Here an engagement was\r\nfought July 28, 1864, in which the Indians were severely punished,\r\nalthough afterwards it developed that few of them were Minnesota Sioux.\r\n\r\nThe troops proceeded up the Little Missouri, where Indians were\r\ndiscovered near Medora. With difficulty Sully traversed 12 miles of\r\nBadlands buttes and gullies, continually harassed by the sniping fire\r\nof Indians along the route. The fighting of this day is known as the\r\nBattle of the Badlands. Following this encounter Sully reached the\r\nYellowstone and returned down the Missouri.\r\n\r\nBefore he arrived at Fort Rice, he was informed that Capt. James\r\nL. Fisk, with a party of immigrants, was in danger. Fisk, who had\r\nmade expeditions through North Dakota in 1862 and 1863, on this trip\r\nfollowed Sully's trail, and in the Badlands was attacked September 1\r\nby Indians, with the loss of several men. During the next few days\r\nseveral other attacks were made, although no one was killed. Messengers\r\nwere sent to Sully for aid, and meanwhile the party threw up what\r\nfortifications they could in the form of sod walls, and, awaited help.\r\nAfter several days the soldiers arrived and brought the immigrants back\r\nto Fort Rice, whence most of them returned to their homes. The remains\r\nof their impromptu fortification, known as Fort Dilts, can still be\r\nseen (_see Tour 9_).\r\n\r\nOne of the most valuable expeditions made through this State was the\r\nStevens Survey of 1853, sent out to discover the most advantageous\r\nroutes to the Pacific for future railroads. The party was financed by\r\na Federal appropriation, and the northern route, through present North\r\nDakota, was under the direction of Gen. I. I. Stevens.\r\n\r\nThe guide on this expedition was Pierre Bottineau, one of the\r\noutstanding personalities in the history of North Dakota and Minnesota\r\nduring this period. Of him it has been written that\r\n\r\n  \"It was the guide Bottineau who walked from Winnipeg to St. Paul\r\n  with James J. Hill, it was the scout Bottineau who headed Jay\r\n  Cooke's first Northern Pacific survey across the continent, it was\r\n  the chief Bottineau who gave his name to Bottineau County, and it\r\n  was the gambler Bottineau who had three queens in his hand, staked\r\n  Nicollet Island, and lost.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1871 the Whistler expedition went up the Little Missouri and into\r\nMontana in search of the most practical route for a railroad to the\r\nPacific. Two years later the Stanley expedition, accompanied by a\r\nlarge military escort, conducted another western survey. Engagements\r\nwith Indians cost this expedition a number of men. One Sioux,\r\nRain-in-the-Face, claimed to have had a part in killing two civilians\r\non the Stanley Survey, and as a result was imprisoned at Fort Lincoln\r\nuntil he escaped. He gained his revenge at the Little Big Horn (_see\r\nSide Tour 8C_).\r\n\r\nThe Northern Pacific Railway received its charter from the Government\r\nin 1864. Magnificent Federal land grants were made: still the road\r\nfound it difficult to raise the necessary capital to finance the\r\nventure, and Jay Cooke & Company undertook the sale of Northern Pacific\r\nsecurities.\r\n\r\nOn the last day of the year 1871 the line was completed to the Red\r\nRiver at Moorhead, and early in March of the next year it was extended\r\nto Fargo. Cooke went into bankruptcy after the financial panic of\r\n1873, but was able to obtain private funds to complete the road to the\r\nMissouri that year. Bismarck remained the western terminus of the line\r\nuntil 1879. During the next two years rails were laid to the Montana\r\nborder, completing the line across the entire State.\r\n\r\nIn 1870, just before the advent of the railways, the estimated white\r\npopulation of present North Dakota was not more than five hundred.\r\nPembina County, extending the length of the Red River Valley and to the\r\nwestern population limit, was the only organized county in the State.\r\n\r\nThe Northern Pacific was completed to the Pacific Coast in 1883.\r\nSquatters preceded the railroad, settlers followed it, trying to guess\r\nfuture town sites so they could force the company to buy them out at\r\nthe most profitable price.\r\n\r\nThe Great Northern was the second important railroad to come into the\r\nState. By 1882 James J. Hill, the \"Empire Builder,\" had extended a\r\nline up the Dakota side of the Red River to Canada. Hill had a vision\r\nof a great railroad connecting the Pacific Coast with the Great Lakes,\r\nwhence produce could be cheaply transported to New York. Construction\r\nbegan in 1880 and the Great Northern was extended westward across\r\nnorthern North Dakota and in 1893 reached the Coast.\r\n\r\nThe railroads linked Dakota with the East and civilization, but to the\r\nwest was the frontier. Here Sioux warriors were beginning to resent\r\nthe encroaching whites and the appropriation of their hunting grounds.\r\nIt was imperative, therefore, that soldiers be kept at Fort Abraham\r\nLincoln.\r\n\r\nTo understand the campaign of 1876 against the Sioux, in which Gen.\r\nGeorge A. Custer met his tragic end, it is necessary to go back to the\r\nIndian treaty of 1868. The Government by this pact promised to abandon\r\nand destroy Forts Reno and Phil Kearney in Wyoming and Fort Smith\r\nin Montana. This having been done, the Sioux were guaranteed their\r\nfreedom in the territory between the North Platte and the Missouri and\r\nYellowstone Rivers. But, when gold was discovered in the Black Hills\r\nby a Government reconnaissance expedition under Custer in the summer\r\nof 1874, white settlers and prospectors begged for admission to the\r\ncoveted territory. Military guards at first attempted to keep them\r\nout, but when the Indians refused in a treaty council in 1875 to sell\r\nor lease land to miners, the Government withdrew the guard and settlers\r\npoured in by thousands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n                                                            RING-BILLED\r\n                                                            GULLS\r\n\r\n  _Photo by Russell Reid_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PASQUES\r\n\r\n                                           _Photo by Russell Reid_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n                                                            FLICKERTAIL\r\n\r\n  _Photo by Russell Reid_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A MODERN\r\n  INDIAN\r\n\r\n                                           _Photo by Russell Reid_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCAFFOLD BURIAL, FORMERLY USED BY SOME INDIAN TRIBES]\r\n\r\nGovernment officials were well aware, when the treaty of 1868 was\r\nviolated, that an Indian war was inevitable; but although the\r\nGovernment had clearly brought the war down on its own head, it sought\r\nthe appearance of righteousness.\r\n\r\nIt was the practice of many Indians to leave their reservations because\r\nthey wanted to hunt or visit, or because the practices of dishonest\r\nagents made life on the reservation unbearable. The Department of\r\nthe Interior sent out orders for all Indians to be back on their\r\nreservations at a certain date, but for many it was impossible to\r\nreturn within the time limit set. The Department designated these\r\npeople as \"hostiles\" and turned them over to the War Department, which\r\nnow had a pretext for taking punitive action.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1876 was planned to force the Indians onto\r\nreservations, in order to obtain the relinquishment of the Black Hills.\r\nGenerals Crook and Gibbon, with their forces, were to meet Generals\r\nTerry and Custer with their troops near the Rosebud River in Montana.\r\nAll were then to move southward against the Indians who were in the\r\nhills along the Rosebud and the Little Big Horn.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of May 17, 1876, the eastern division of the expedition\r\nstarted out from Fort Abraham Lincoln. The cavalry marched about the\r\nparade grounds to the tune of _Garry Owen_, then set out to the strains\r\nof _The Girl I Left Behind Me_. Mrs. Custer accompanied her husband on\r\nthe first day's ride, returning to the fort as the troopers continued\r\nwest.\r\n\r\nThe tragic outcome of the Battle of the Little Big Horn is well known.\r\nNot a man of Custer's immediate command survived. The reasons for the\r\nannihilation have been debated far and wide. Gen. E. S. Godfrey, who\r\nparticipated in the battle as a lieutenant, in _Custer's Last Battle_\r\nsummarizes the affair as follows: \"The causes of Custer's defeat were\r\nfirst, the overpowering number of the enemy and their unexpected\r\ncohesion; second, Reno's panic rout from the valley; third, the\r\ndefective extraction of empty cartridge shells from the carbines.... A\r\nbattle was unavoidable.\"\r\n\r\nGrant Marsh had pushed his supply steamer, the _Far West_, up the\r\nBig Horn to within 15 miles of the battlefield. Reno's wounded were\r\nplaced aboard and Marsh made the trip of 710 miles down to Bismarck\r\nin record time. At midnight July 5 the _Far West_ docked. Colonel\r\nLounsberry, editor of the Bismarck _Tribune_ and correspondent of the\r\nNew York _Herald_, gave the story to the world. Mark Kellogg, special\r\ncorrespondent of the _Herald_ and the _Tribune_, who had accompanied\r\nthe expedition, had been killed with Custer. Twenty-six widows wept at\r\nFort Lincoln. With Custer's death the frontier era in Dakota history\r\nhad ended. Although Sitting Bull's forces were undefeated, they took\r\nrefuge in Canada and remained there until 1881, when they voluntarily\r\nsurrendered.\r\n\r\nThey were returned to the reservations. Wishing to keep them there,\r\nthe authorities took horses, saddles, and arms from both hostile and\r\npeaceable Sioux. This move, while it did not pacify the Indians, put an\r\nend to the Indian wars.\r\n\r\n\r\nTERRITORIAL SOLONS AND STRATEGY\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Little Big Horn campaign Dakota's Territorial\r\nGovernment had functioned for 15 years and was destined to continue 13\r\nyears longer. The Territory had been organized in 1861 and President\r\nLincoln had appointed his family physician, Dr. William Jayne, first\r\nGovernor. As first laid out the new Territory included the present\r\nStates of North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Wyoming, but after\r\na series of changes it was reduced in 1882 to the area of the present\r\nDakotas.\r\n\r\nYankton, in the southern part of the Territory, was the capital city,\r\nand there the first legislature met in 1862. It was an assembly\r\nrepresentative of every type in the Territory--all with great and\r\nvarying ideas of how the ship of state was to be kept afloat.\r\n\r\nThirteen members composed the house, while the senate or council had\r\nbut nine. In attendance at the session for various reasons were Jim\r\nSomers, frontiersman, \"armed like an arsenal\"; Father Turner of New\r\nYork; George Kingsbury, newspaperman; Dr. Walter Burleigh, later\r\nconnected with the Indian Service and the Northern Pacific Railway; and\r\nGen. T. C. Campbell.\r\n\r\nTerritorial Dakota displayed no small interest in politics. Campaigns\r\nwere periods of great excitement, with long parades of ardent\r\nsupporters following the candidates, with cheering and shouting and\r\nbragging and fighting by office seekers and votaries alike. It took\r\na brave man to campaign in those days. When Moses Armstrong ran for\r\nCongress on the Democratic ticket his friend, Gen. T. C. Campbell,\r\ninvited him into his part of the Territory to speak. During the\r\ngeneral's speech his hat was shot off, but his oratory did not falter.\r\nWhen it came Armstrong's turn to speak he hesitated about addressing\r\nsuch a boisterous crowd, but the general informed him that the time to\r\ndo his praying was before he crossed the county line, not after.\r\n\r\nCounty seat removals were a prime source of political interest, and\r\nthe cities in the Territory fought tooth and nail for the privileges\r\nof the county capital. Stuffing ballot boxes was not uncommon, and in\r\nmany instances where removal was voted the defeated city would refuse\r\nto give up the county records, and guards would be posted against\r\nnocturnal raids of the courthouse vaults by citizens of the victorious\r\ntown. When the Emmons County _Record_ defeated a plan to move the\r\ncounty seat from Williamsport in 1888, it took full advantage of its\r\nsuccess. Beneath the decoration of a crowing cock heading the column,\r\nthese headlines, typical of the county seat controversies, appeared in\r\nthe _Record_ November 9 of that year:\r\n\r\n                                  ELI\r\n\r\n        And Billsport Hath The\r\n        Appellation Earned,\r\n      For Lo! She Doth Get There\r\n            With Both Feet.\r\n      And She Moppeth the Earth\r\n    With the Cohorts of the Wicked.\r\n        Yea, Verily, of the Wadites,\r\n        of the Bumstedites, and\r\n            the Vanbekites,\r\n    And They Shall Gnaw a File and\r\n        Flee Into the Mountains\r\n            of Hepsidam.\r\n        FE!  FI!  FO!  FUM!\r\n\r\nThe entire edition, in celebration of the occasion, was printed in red\r\nink.\r\n\r\nTerritorial Governors and other high officials were not popular with\r\nthe people. They were usually from the East and had no interest in\r\nthe country, their salaries or political advancement being their\r\nchief concern. Just after the first legislature had adjourned an\r\nIndian uprising disturbed the settlers. It did not take the Governor\r\nand other officials long to quit the Territory. Moses Armstrong,\r\nlater a Congressman, wrote, \"With such rapidity do they fly, pale and\r\nbreathless, that a boy could play marbles on their horizontal coat\r\ntails.\"\r\n\r\nDakota Territory covered about 150,000 square miles and had 36\r\nrepresentatives in the legislature during the 1880's for its population\r\nof 300,000. Four judges and three prosecuting attorneys administered\r\nmatters of Territorial justice.\r\n\r\nThe second legislative session was no quieter than the first. Because\r\nof disputed delegations there were two houses--one met on the levee by\r\nthe Missouri and the other on the hill above the river. After much time\r\nhad been lost the differences were compromised and business proceeded.\r\n\r\nIn 1863 Newton Edmunds of Yankton was appointed Governor of Dakota,\r\nthe only resident of the Territory ever to hold that office. The next\r\nGovernor was Faulk of Pennsylvania, then followed Burbank of Indiana,\r\nPennington of Alabama, Howard of Michigan, Ordway of Vermont, Pierce of\r\nNew York and Illinois, Church of New York and Indiana, and Mellette of\r\nIndiana.\r\n\r\nThe northern and southern parts of the Territory had little in common,\r\nand they kept growing farther apart as time went on. In the session of\r\n1883 removal of the capital from Yankton was the big question. Yankton\r\nwanted to keep it, Bismarck, Huron, Mitchell, Pierre, and Chamberlain\r\nwanted to acquire it, and Fargo or Jamestown would have taken it if\r\noffered. A bill was finally passed providing that the Governor appoint\r\nnine commissioners to choose a capital city; they were to accept an\r\noffer of not less than $100,000 and 160 acres of land on which the\r\ncapitol was to be built. The land remaining after the capitol grounds\r\nwere provided for was to be sold for the benefit of the building fund.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners named were Milo Scott of Grand Forks County, Burleigh\r\nSpalding of Cass, Alexander McKenzie of Burleigh, Charles Myers of\r\nSpink, George Mathews of Brookings, Alexander Hughes of Yankton, Henry\r\nde Long of Lincoln, John P. Belding of Lawrence, and M. B. Thompson of\r\nClay.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners must, according to law, meet and organize at Yankton.\r\nFeeling ran high; the city did not intend to part with the capital\r\nwithout a struggle. Yanktonians awaited the commissioners.\r\n\r\nBut unknown to the citizens of Yankton, the commissioners had\r\nchartered a special train, leaving Sioux City April 3, at 3 a. m.\r\nThe commissioners' coach was dimly lighted as the train pulled into\r\nthe city limits of Yankton. The meeting was quickly called to order,\r\nofficers were chosen, and the meeting adjourned until that afternoon in\r\nCanton. The train had still a half mile to go to the city limits when\r\nthe meeting was over. The commissioners had satisfied the law, having\r\nmet, organized, and adjourned in Yankton.\r\n\r\nThe commission thereafter made the rounds of several towns, and was\r\nroyally entertained by prospective capital cities. Bismarck's offer of\r\n$100,000 and 320 acres of land was the best bid received. Thus Bismarck\r\nbecame the Territorial capital.\r\n\r\nThe cornerstone ceremonies took place September 5, 1883. Many high\r\nofficials and prominent citizens from the East were guests of the\r\nNorthern Pacific on the Villard \"gold spike\" excursion, and were\r\npresent as guests of honor at the laying of the cornerstone. Among them\r\nwere Henry Villard, president of the Northern Pacific Railway; General\r\nGrant; General Haupt; Henry M. Teller, Secretary of the Interior; the\r\nHon. Sackville West, British Minister; members of the Austro-Hungarian,\r\nthe Danish, and the Norwegian-Swedish Legations; the Imperial German\r\nMinister; Territorial Governor Ordway; and numerous United States\r\nSenators, Governors, and mayors.\r\n\r\nThe next great task was to convince Congress that the Territory was\r\nready for statehood. As early as 1871 the legislature had requested\r\nCongress to divide the Territory, and in 1874 Moses Armstrong, while\r\nin Congress, had petitioned that the northern part be made into a new\r\nTerritory named Pembina. Nearly every year a petition was sent to\r\nCongress praying for admission as two States. In 1860 it was suggested\r\nthat the northern part be called North Dakota. The Territorial\r\nlegislative assembly in 1889 provided that a constitutional convention\r\nbe held for North Dakota, and February 22, 1889, Congress passed an\r\nenabling act for North Dakota, South Dakota, Washington, and Montana.\r\n\r\nDelegates to the State convention were elected May 14, 1889, and the\r\nconvention met in Bismarck July 4 of that year. A parade in which\r\nSitting Bull and other famous Indians participated was part of the\r\nentertainment afforded the delegates. Election to approve or disapprove\r\nthe proposed constitution was held October 1, 1889, and as it was a\r\ncertainty that the constitution would be accepted, legislators, State\r\nofficials, and Congressmen were elected at the same time. President\r\nHarrison on November 2, 1889, declared North Dakota a State, and John\r\nMiller at the same moment became first Governor of North Dakota.\r\n\r\nHand in hand with the political development of the Territory had gone\r\nsocial and economic progress. By the time statehood was attained\r\nfarmhouses and towns had broken up the barren loneliness of the\r\nprairies. Sod shanties, the pioneers' first homes, were being replaced\r\nby solid frame structures. Huge bonanza farms were employing hundreds\r\nof men and using advanced farming methods that had not yet been\r\nintroduced on farms in the East (_see_ AGRICULTURE & FARM LIFE).\r\nSchools were being built in every community. Six years before statehood\r\none private college had been established, and the University of North\r\nDakota had opened its doors and was offering courses in the arts and\r\nsciences to ambitious pioneer youth.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLICIES AND POLITICS SINCE STATEHOOD\r\n\r\nWhen the constitutional convention for North Dakota completed its work\r\non August 17, 1889, the product of its labors was a document six times\r\nas long as the Federal Constitution. Based upon a model constitution\r\ndrawn up by Prof. James Bradley Thayer of the Harvard Law School, it\r\ncontained extremely advanced and enlightened provisions, 217 sections\r\nincluded in 20 articles. To these have since been added 49 amendments.\r\n\r\nThe civic pattern adopted was very similar to that in force in the\r\nolder States. The legislative branch in North Dakota consists of a\r\nbicameral legislature which meets in January each odd-numbered year.\r\nThe executive branch is headed by the Governor, who is elected for\r\na term of two years. He has the general veto power and authority to\r\nreject any item in an appropriation bill. The judicial department\r\nconsists of a supreme court of five members, elected for 10-year\r\nterms; district courts, county courts, and justices of the peace.\r\nThe State is divided into six judicial districts, each one under an\r\nelective district judge. County courts are courts of record concerned\r\nwith such matters as probate and guardianship, but in counties having\r\ncounty courts of increased jurisdiction such courts have concurrent\r\njurisdiction with district courts in certain cases.\r\n\r\nThe State is divided into counties whose administrative functions\r\nare carried out by boards of commissioners elected every two years.\r\nAny city or village of 500 population or more may choose either the\r\ncommission form of government or the mayor and council type.\r\n\r\nThe framework of government is perhaps not very different from that\r\nin many other States. It is the legislation in North Dakota that has\r\nbeen anything but a copy of that in any sister State, and the outcome\r\nof some of her political experiments has often been of Nation-wide\r\ninterest. The economy of the State is preponderantly rural, and the\r\ntendency has therefore been to try anything that seemed likely to help\r\nin the solution of the farmer's problems.\r\n\r\nThe legislature of the State of North Dakota met for the first time\r\nNovember 19, 1889. This session lasted 120 days, but the length of all\r\nsubsequent sessions was fixed by the constitution at 60 days. The first\r\nmen this State sent to the United States Senate were Gilbert Pierce of\r\nFargo and Lyman Casey of Jamestown. H. C. Hansbrough of Devils Lake\r\nwas the first Congressman. The supreme court had for its chief justice\r\nGuy C. H. Corliss, and Joseph M. Bartholomew and Alfred Wallin were\r\nassociate justices.\r\n\r\nIn this first session the legislature instituted a department of\r\nagriculture for \"the promotion of stock-breeding, agriculture,\r\nhorticulture, manufactures and domestic arts.\" A school law enacted\r\nat this session was an enlightened and detailed piece of legislation.\r\nNorth Dakota had at the beginning of statehood a well-organized school\r\nsystem of 1,362 public schools with 1,741 teachers; a State university\r\nat Grand Forks; Catholic schools at Fargo, Grand Forks, and Bismarck; a\r\nCongregational college at Fargo; a Presbyterian college at Jamestown;\r\nand at Tower City a Baptist college, which, however, failed to survive.\r\n\r\nOne of the most exciting battles of the first legislative session\r\nwas the bill to license the Louisiana Lottery. Rumors circulated to\r\nthe effect that bribery was being practiced, that the lobbyists for\r\nthe lottery were making liberal offers for votes. The Governor and\r\nhis friends had hired detectives from the Pinkerton Agency to mingle\r\nwith the legislators and lobbyists. When the detectives had all the\r\ninformation they needed, they revealed their identity to the lottery\r\nsupporters. Fearing exposure, the lottery enthusiasts gave up the fight\r\nand the bill was killed.\r\n\r\nNorth Dakota was faced with the drought problem during the\r\nadministration of Gov. Andrew Burke (1891-92), and the people looked to\r\nthe legislature for some solution to their problems. Their petitions\r\nwere not at all times considered seriously. One member offered a\r\nresolution praying Congress to pass a law establishing a scientific\r\nrain bureau and a law offering a reward to anyone discovering a\r\npractical system of producing rainfall. The house referred his\r\nresolution to the temperance committee.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of statehood North Dakota had been subject to a\r\nrather autocratic form of government in spite of decidedly democratic\r\nconstitutional provisions. The State had been economically dependent\r\non the East. The directing powers in the early State government were\r\ncentered in St. Paul and Minneapolis. Eastern wealth had furnished\r\ncapital for the railroads, and the railroads had been responsible for\r\nthe settlement of the State. Likewise, the farmer's crops had also to\r\nbe sold in the East, and his machinery and supplies must necessarily be\r\npurchased there.\r\n\r\nAt the time North Dakota was admitted to the Union the Republican Party\r\nwas in control. Democrats at that time in State history and for long\r\nafterward were few and far between. These two old-line parties were the\r\nonly two worthy of note in this early period, although the Populists\r\npolled a large vote in the first Presidential election and North Dakota\r\ndivided its first electoral vote, one vote going to the Democratic, one\r\nto the Republican, and one to the Populist candidate.\r\n\r\nThe railroads and financial interests of St. Paul and Minneapolis had\r\nvery early begun interfering in North Dakota politics. Judson LaMoure\r\nand Alexander McKenzie were the lords of this era, both representing\r\nrailroad interests in State politics, and the favors they were able to\r\nbestow were a safeguard against legislation hostile to the companies.\r\nIn time they came to be the protectors of other interests, including\r\nbanks, insurance companies, line elevators, and lumber companies.\r\n\r\nThe first revolt against this system came in 1892. Gov. Andrew Burke\r\nhad vetoed a bill favored by the Farmers' Alliance which would force\r\nrailroads to lease sites or rights-of-way for grain elevators and\r\nwarehouses. The Farmers' Alliance, Democrats, and Populists fused, and\r\nEli C. D. Shortridge was elected Governor.\r\n\r\nIn Governor Shortridge's administration the legislature passed a bill\r\nfor highway improvement. Money was appropriated to enlarge the State\r\ncapitol building.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of legislation during the session of 1893 was definitely\r\ntoward the principles of the Populist platform. During Shortridge's\r\nadministration North Dakota attempted its first State ownership\r\nventure. One hundred thousand dollars was appropriated to build a State\r\nelevator at Duluth, Superior, or West Superior. The panic of 1893 came\r\non and the plan was not carried out. In 1894 Roger Allin, regular\r\nRepublican, was elected Governor, and with that election the first\r\nbrief rebellion against Eastern capitalism was ended.\r\n\r\nGovernor Allin felt it necessary to veto several appropriations in\r\norder to keep within the probable revenue, and State institutions had\r\npractically no funds for operation. In the case of the university,\r\nsalary was provided for the janitor but not for the faculty. President\r\nMerrifield and the faculty preferred to serve without any pay rather\r\nthan close the institution, and necessary expenditures were met by\r\nprivate subscription. Other institutions were kept open in the same way.\r\n\r\nDuring the administration of Gov. Frank Briggs (1897-98) the\r\nSpanish-American War broke out. The entire National Guard volunteered\r\nits services, but many members could not be accepted because of the\r\nquota set for North Dakota. North Dakota volunteers took part in 30\r\nengagements and skirmishes during the Philippine insurrection.\r\n\r\nGovernor Briggs died in July 1898 and his term was completed by the\r\nLieutenant Governor, Joseph M. Devine, who later served several\r\nyears as commissioner of immigration. Both Briggs and Devine were\r\nRepublicans, and they were succeeded in 1898 by another member of their\r\nparty, Frederick B. Fancher, a leader in the Farmers' Alliance. Fancher\r\ndeclined a second term, and was succeeded by Maj. Frank White, who had\r\nserved in the Philippines. White found the State debt the chief problem\r\nof his administration. He served two terms and yielded his office to E.\r\nY. Sarles.\r\n\r\nLegislation during Sarles' term tended toward control and regulation\r\nof corporations. A board was created to supervise State banks, and the\r\nmanner of organizing insurance companies in the State was prescribed.\r\n\r\nSarles was defeated for reelection by \"Honest John\" Burke, a Democrat,\r\nand the only Governor of this State to serve three terms. From the\r\ngovernorship he left North Dakota to become United States Treasurer\r\nunder President Wilson, later served as chief justice of the North\r\nDakota Supreme Court, remaining a member of the court until his death\r\nin 1937. Crawford, in his history of North Dakota, has said, \"The\r\nlegislative history of the Burke administrations is an instructive\r\nillustration of the ideals and motives which were so characteristic\r\nof the [Theodore] Roosevelt era.\" State institutions were liberally\r\nprovided for, a primary election law was enacted, prohibition laws were\r\nenforced, schools were improved, and various regulatory offices and\r\nboards were created.\r\n\r\nA second revolution in North Dakota political history was ushered in\r\nwith the election of Burke. The Progressive Republicans, enthusiastic\r\nsupporters of the so-called \"LaFollette reforms,\" had formed a\r\ncoalition with the Democrats to elect this first Democrat Governor of\r\nNorth Dakota. \"It was,\" according to Judge Andrew Bruce in his book\r\n_The Non-Partisan League_, \"the revolution which laid the foundations\r\nfor the present Non-Partisan League, for in it the farmers found a new\r\nwar cry and new objects of anathema. The war cry was 'North Dakota for\r\nNorth Dakotans' and the objects of their anathema were 'Big Business,\r\nMcKenzie, and McKenzieism.'\"\r\n\r\nGov. Louis B. Hanna succeeded Burke in 1913. In 1912, a Presidential\r\nelection year, North Dakota's electoral votes went to Woodrow Wilson.\r\nNew apportionment gave this State three representatives in Congress\r\ninstead of two. Governor Hanna asserted his belief in businesslike\r\nadministration of government offices, and revised the accounting\r\nmethods in State departments. Throughout this period tendencies in the\r\nState were progressive: social legislation was favored; the State grew\r\nrapidly in population; new towns were springing up; the automobile age\r\nhad arrived.\r\n\r\nThrough all this ran the thread of the second political revolution\r\nwhich Burke's election had begun, and which was continued through the\r\nHanna administration. It was directed principally against injustices\r\nin the grain trade. Farmers were incapable of developing their own\r\nmarketing facilities. Millions had been invested in the mills and\r\nelevators of St. Paul, Minneapolis, and Duluth, and in the \"line\"\r\n(corporation) elevator companies throughout North Dakota. The farmers\r\ncomplained of unfair methods of grading and docking their grain;\r\nthey claimed that the Minneapolis Chamber of Commerce was a closed\r\ncorporation, and that its members were identified with the big milling\r\nand elevator interests. Even conservative Senator McCumber of North\r\nDakota protested in 1916 before the United States Senate against abuses\r\nin the grain trade.\r\n\r\nThe Equity Exchange had been organized in 1909 to act as a farmers'\r\ngeneral selling agency in St. Paul, but had been denied membership in\r\nthe Minneapolis Chamber of Commerce. The Society of Equity and the\r\nEquity Exchange tried to get a bill through the 1915 legislature for\r\nthe establishment of a State-owned elevator, but the attempt failed.\r\nIndignation at the defeat of the bill resulted in the birth, in\r\nFebruary 1915, of a new political party, the Nonpartisan[1] League.\r\n\r\n[1] The party name was originally spelled \"Non-Partisan\" but through\r\nusage has been changed to its present form.\r\n\r\nA. C. Townley, a genius in the art of organization, spread the league\r\ngospel through the State. Townley had begun life in poverty, had\r\nfailed in a large-scale flax-growing enterprise, and had for a time\r\nbeen identified with the Socialist Party. A. C. Bowen suggested the\r\nformation of the league. Charles Edward Russell was the first editor\r\nof the newspaper, the _Non-Partisan Leader_, and Walter Thomas Mills\r\ndrafted many of its laws. All three of these men were Socialists.\r\n\r\nAfter winning the support of a prominent farmer, Fred Wood, and his two\r\nsons, the movement spread rapidly. Before the end of the first year the\r\nleague had 30,000 members. Its platform embodied five planks:\r\n\r\n  1. State ownership of terminal elevators, flour mills, packing\r\n     houses, and cold storage plants.\r\n  2. State inspection of grain and grain dockage.\r\n  3. Exemption of farm improvements from taxation.\r\n  4. State hail insurance on the acreage tax basis.\r\n  5. Rural credit banks operated at cost.\r\n\r\n\"Practical salesmanship, a program of immediate and forceful action and\r\nthe use of the Ford automobile are the factors principally explaining\r\nthe rise of the Non-Partisan League,\" declares Herbert Gaston in his\r\nbook _The Non-Partisan League_.\r\n\r\nMost of the league membership was Republican; it was therefore an\r\neasy step to the use of the machinery of that party. In the primary\r\nelection of June 1916 and again in the fall the league was successful.\r\nLynn J. Frazier became the first league-elected Governor, and three\r\nleague-endorsed candidates, R. H. Grace, James E. Robinson, and L. E.\r\nBirdzell, were placed on the supreme court bench.\r\n\r\nThree hundred thousand dollars was appropriated by the legislature\r\nto carry out the provisions of a Terminal Elevator Commission bill,\r\nbut Frazier vetoed the act, declaring the appropriation insufficient.\r\nAmong the progressive legislation enacted at this session were bills\r\nproviding for the creation of a State highway department, land title\r\nregistration (never enforced, however), increased funds for rural\r\nschools, reduction of rate of assessments on farm improvements to 5\r\npercent of the true value, and guarantee of deposits in State banks.\r\n\r\nEntry of the United States into the World War brought new activities\r\nto North Dakota in the spring of 1917. National Guard units were\r\nsent, a Council of National Defense was created to aid in the work of\r\nmobilization, Liberty Bonds were sold, and the State went $200,000 over\r\nits quota in the United War Work campaign.\r\n\r\nThe World War interrupted, but did not deter, the progress of the\r\nleague program. Governor Frazier was reelected in 1918, and seven\r\ninitiated amendments were added to the State constitution, forming\r\nthe basis for the league program. The law for initiated petitions was\r\nchanged to require only 20,000 signers; the $200,000 debt limit of the\r\nState was abolished and the State was allowed to issue or guarantee\r\nbonds not to exceed $10,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe league's industrial program was established at the 1919 legislative\r\nsession. The industrial commission, composed of the Governor, the\r\nattorney general, and the commissioner of agriculture and labor, was to\r\nmanage the industries and enterprises undertaken by the State. Under\r\nauthority of the new legislation, the North Dakota Mill and Elevator\r\nAssociation was established. A small mill was purchased at Drake and\r\nlater a mill and elevator were built at Grand Forks with a capacity of\r\n3,000 barrels per day and a storage capacity of 1,659,500 bushels (_see\r\nTour 1_).\r\n\r\nIn the March primary of 1920 an unusual initiated measure was the\r\ncenter of interest. It was the \"recall\", which provided for the removal\r\nof any elective officers, even judges. The measure became Article 33 of\r\nthe constitution.\r\n\r\nThe elections of 1920 again saw the league victorious. In the\r\nRepublican primaries Dr. E. F. Ladd, president of the State\r\nagricultural college, defeated Senator Gronna for the nomination as\r\nUnited States Senator. William Langer, who had been elected attorney\r\ngeneral in 1916 with the endorsement of the league, opposed Governor\r\nFrazier in the primary and was defeated by a small margin. Frazier and\r\nLadd were elected in November.\r\n\r\nTwo important initiated measures were passed, one providing for a board\r\nof auditors to audit the accounts of the State treasurer, the Bank of\r\nNorth Dakota, and all State industries, the other amending a previous\r\nmeasure so that although State funds and State institution funds must\r\nbe deposited in the Bank of North Dakota, county, township, municipal,\r\nand school district funds need not be deposited there.\r\n\r\nIn 1920 deflation of the league's boom set in. The United States\r\nSupreme Court declared the grain grading law unconstitutional. The\r\nIndependent Voters Association, anti-Nonpartisan, argued that the\r\ncost of government had greatly increased under the Nonpartisans. In\r\nthe 1921 session of the legislature committees were appointed to\r\ninvestigate. The minority of the Senate committee reported that the\r\nindustrial commission had practiced a policy of favoritism in affairs\r\nof the Bank of North Dakota in distributing public funds to private\r\nbanks, so that the bank could not at that time meet its obligations;\r\nthat the commission had failed to exercise proper control of the North\r\nDakota Home Builders' Association, so that its affairs were hopelessly\r\nmuddled; that it had approved contracts between the Drake mill and\r\nprivate merchants, especially the Consumers United Stores Company, a\r\nsubsidiary corporation of the Nonpartisan League, resulting in losses\r\nto the State; that it had approved a policy of the Bank of North Dakota\r\nby which $2,000,000 of a total $5,200,000 in live claims against\r\nsolvent banks were against 37 institutions mostly classed as \"league\r\nbanks\" or \"friendly\" politically; that it had allowed officers of the\r\nbank to deposit public funds in private banks with the result that\r\n$1,400,000 of these funds were tied up in insolvent banks.\r\n\r\nThe recall was exercised for the first time in the United States\r\nagainst the governor of a State. In a special election of 1921, Frazier\r\nwas defeated by R. A. Nestos, Republican, a member of the Independent\r\nVoters Association, or I. V. A.'s, as they were popularly called.\r\nThe other two members of the industrial commission, Attorney General\r\nWilliam Lemke and Commissioner of Agriculture and Labor John Hagan,\r\nwere also recalled. But measures initiated to curtail the industrial\r\nprogram failed; Governor Nestos had to administer a program to which\r\nhis party was opposed. Nestos was reelected in 1922. In the same\r\nelection former Governor Frazier, running for United States Senator,\r\ndefeated J. F. T. O'Connor, Democrat, who later became comptroller of\r\ncurrency under President Franklin D. Roosevelt.\r\n\r\nGovernor Nestos was defeated by the Nonpartisan candidate, Arthur G.\r\nSorlie, in the primary of 1924 while I. V. A. Republicans won several\r\nof the State offices. Senator Ladd died in office and a Nonpartisan\r\nnewspaperman, Gerald P. Nye, was appointed to fill the vacancy. He\r\nholds that office at the present time (1938). When Governor Sorlie\r\ndied, Walter Maddock, Lieutenant Governor, filled out the term.\r\n\r\nIn 1928 George Shafer, an I. V. A., who had been attorney general under\r\nNestos, was elected Governor, and in 1930 he was reelected.\r\n\r\nThe debt limit having been increased at various times, North Dakota's\r\nbonded debt in 1930 was estimated to be $36,357,200; $1,000,000\r\nrepresented in capital stock of the Bank of North Dakota; $4,000,000\r\nin mill and elevator construction and milling bonds; the remainder in\r\nvarious real estate bond series.\r\n\r\nBy 1930 North Dakota's population was 680,845, more than double the\r\nfigure at the opening of the century. Large foreign immigrations\r\naccounted for the approximately 88 percent rise in the 1910 census over\r\nthat of 1900, and by 1920 the figure had risen to 646,872. Statistics\r\nof the U. S. Bureau of Census show North Dakota to have been the only\r\nspring wheat State having an increase of population during the period\r\nfrom 1930-35. The growth has been almost entirely rural; from 1920 to\r\n1930 no new urban centers (above 2,500) have appeared in the State.\r\n\r\nThe State capitol building was destroyed by fire December 28, 1930, and\r\nplans were immediately laid for building a new statehouse. A $2,000,000\r\nbuilding, unique in that it is North Dakota's only skyscraper, today\r\nstands on Bismarck's Capitol Hill.\r\n\r\nAn initiative measure in the election of 1932 repealed the prohibition\r\nclause in the State constitution, making North Dakota, dry since it\r\nbecame a Territory, a wet State.\r\n\r\nWilliam Langer, who had been elected attorney general on the\r\nNonpartisan ticket with Frazier and later was defeated as I. V. A.\r\ncandidate for governor by Frazier, was elected Governor in 1932, once\r\nmore running as a Nonpartisan.\r\n\r\nThe period following proved a trying one for the rural population of\r\nNorth Dakota. The farmers suffered because of low market prices for\r\nfarm products, low land values, bank failures, and crop failures. The\r\nsituation was acute at the beginning of Langer's administration because\r\nmany farm mortgages had been based on pre-depression valuations.\r\nFarmers feared foreclosure and the wastage of their life efforts.\r\n\r\nTo prevent foreclosure Governor Langer declared various farm mortgage\r\nmoratoriums by executive order. For a time an embargo was in effect on\r\nagricultural products, forbidding shipment of them from the State in\r\nthe hope that prices would be forced up. A law enacted to extend the\r\nperiod of redemption on real estate mortgages was held unconstitutional\r\nby the North Dakota Supreme Court as applied to existing mortgages. In\r\n1933 laws were passed outlawing crop mortgages and deficiency judgments.\r\n\r\nA stormy period in State history ensued when Governor Langer was\r\nremoved from office July 18, 1934, having been held disqualified\r\nunder the State constitution by the supreme court because of his\r\nconviction on a Federal charge of conspiracy, arising from solicitation\r\nof contributions from State and Federal employes for support of his\r\npolitical newspaper, the _Leader_. (The Federal Courts later reversed\r\nthe conviction.) Ole Olson, Lieutenant Governor, served the remainder\r\nof the term.\r\n\r\nThomas H. Moodie, first Democratic Governor to be elected in 24 years,\r\ntook office in January 1935, only to be declared ineligible by the\r\nsupreme court February 2, because of insufficient residence in the\r\nState. Walter Welford, Nonpartisan Lieutenant Governor, became acting\r\nGovernor, the fourth to occupy the gubernatorial chair in little more\r\nthan six months.\r\n\r\nThe legislature of 1935 created a State Planning Board to make\r\ninvestigations and surveys relative to the conservation and utilization\r\nof the State's natural resources, and a State Welfare Board to act as\r\nofficial agency of the State in any social welfare activity initiated\r\nby the Federal Government and to allocate State and Federal funds\r\navailable for such purpose. The planning board has since cooperated\r\nwith the Federal Government in work which has involved development of\r\nnatural resources and building of dams to overcome effects of drought.\r\n\r\nOther legislation of the 1935 session provided for a retail sales tax\r\nwhich resulted in greatly increased revenues for education and public\r\nwelfare purposes, a drivers license law, and a two-year mortgage\r\nforeclosure moratorium. Two radical changes in public policy effected\r\nthrough initiated measures in 1935 were provision for manufacture,\r\nsale, and distribution of beer, and for Sunday motion pictures.\r\n\r\nFormer Governor Langer, defeated by Acting Governor Welford for\r\nthe Nonpartisan nomination for the governorship in 1936, surprised\r\nopponents in both the league and other parties by polling a majority in\r\nthe election, the first governor of any State elected in the individual\r\ncolumn on the ballot. In the same election North Dakota put liquor\r\ncontrol in the hands of counties, municipalities, and villages.\r\n\r\nIndicative of the increasing responsibilities of State Governments, the\r\nsocial-minded legislature of 1937 made the largest appropriation for\r\npublic welfare in the history of the State--more than $6,100,000 for\r\nthe 1937-39 biennium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE AND FARM LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nLand of supersized farms, of spring wheat and winter rye rippling in\r\nthe wind, of gigantic flower gardens of paradise-blue flax--this is\r\nNorth Dakota, one of the greatest agricultural States of the Nation.\r\n\r\nThose who have seen the vast fields in the summer know the meaning\r\nof this land to the farmer and the stock-raiser; for while the\r\nromantically inclined can meditate on the beauties of a bronze\r\nwheatfield under the July sun, or the picturesque qualities of fine\r\ncattle grazing on a hillside, the agricultural statistician can point\r\nout that 87 percent of the land in the State is devoted to agriculture,\r\nand, given sufficient moisture, the richly productive soil will more\r\nthan repay the efforts of the farmer or stockman who depends upon it\r\nfor his livelihood.\r\n\r\nHere in North Dakota were the original bonanza farms--so-called because\r\nof their almost fabulous yields of wheat--some of them two or three\r\ntownships in extent. They are gone now, but the size of the farms today\r\nstill startles those familiar with agriculture in other States, for\r\nmany holdings run as high as 10,000 acres, and the average for the\r\nwhole State is 463 acres, as against the United States average of 154.8\r\nacres.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily the rainfall is sufficient to bring crops of high value,\r\ndespite the fact that in the western two-thirds of the State\r\nit is not abundant. In occasional years the moisture is poorly\r\ndistributed, resulting in lessened cash values. About twice in a\r\ncentury the dry-land farming area of the United States, of which\r\nthe western two-thirds of this State is a part, is subject to major\r\ndrought conditions. At such times farming is difficult and in places\r\nimpossible--without irrigation. In the drought of the 1880's there were\r\nfew people in North Dakota to suffer. It took the recent major drought\r\nwhich began in 1929 to impress not only upon North Dakotans, but upon\r\nthe Federal Government as well, the necessity for reliance in part upon\r\nirrigation, utilizing the waters that flow so abundantly through the\r\nState--and out of it.\r\n\r\nMore than a thousand dams are contemplated in the Works Progress\r\nAdministration program for the State. Many have already been completed,\r\nand steps are being taken to divert the waters of the Missouri River\r\ninto the James and Sheyenne Rivers, and to utilize waters in western\r\ntributaries of the Missouri.\r\n\r\nFortunately, North Dakota has never had a land boom. The result is that\r\nprices of agricultural land are low, and with the returning rains it\r\nis likely that the State will experience a new wave of confidence and\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nNaturally, in a State where 87 percent of the land is devoted to\r\nagricultural pursuits, farm conditions are of paramount importance to\r\nalmost every person. Directly dependent upon the soil are the farm\r\nresidents who compose 53.6 percent of North Dakota's population.\r\nDirectly dependent upon the wealth of the farmer are the 28.6\r\npercent who live in small rural towns, and, almost as directly, the\r\n17.9 percent who compose the urban population. Of the urban group,\r\napproximately one-third are employed in the processing of agricultural\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nThe same general boundaries that divide the State topographically\r\nalso designate the three agricultural belts. The Red River Valley and\r\nDrift Prairie are combined in what is known as the black-earth belt,\r\nthe Coteau du Missouri constitutes the farming-grazing belt, and the\r\nMissouri Slope is the grazing-forage belt.\r\n\r\nIn the black-earth belt the farms are usually small, averaging less\r\nthan 400 acres in extent. Here the average annual rainfall varies from\r\n18 to 24 inches, 6 to 8 inches of which falls during the months of May\r\nand June, when it is most valuable to small grains.\r\n\r\nThe black-earth region was the first part of North Dakota to be\r\nsettled. Furs were the object of the earliest white settlers there,\r\nbut the value of agricultural pursuits was by no means overlooked\r\neven during that early period. Alexander Henry, Jr., the fur trader\r\nwho foresaw that the Red River Valley would be good agricultural land\r\nif the transportation problem could be solved, tells in his diary of\r\nplanting a garden as early as 1800 at his trading post at the mouth of\r\nthe Pembina River, where he raised carrots, cabbages, beets, potatoes,\r\nand other vegetables. Nor was he free from the evils which beset the\r\nmodern farmer: his crop was highly satisfactory for several years, but\r\nin 1808 everything was eaten by the grasshoppers which swarmed across\r\nthe land. Henry's agrarian ventures were secondary to his fur trading,\r\nhowever, and it was not until the friends of Charles Cavileer settled\r\nat Pembina in 1851 that a permanent agricultural colony was established\r\nin the State. An earlier settlement by the Selkirkers of Canada in\r\n1812 had been short-lived. When the Cavileer colony arrived, however,\r\nthe Selkirk colonists, now established at Fort Douglas, Winnipeg, not\r\nonly provided Cavileer himself with a bride but also supplied his\r\npeople with seed wheat, oats, barley, and field peas--an invaluable\r\ncontribution.\r\n\r\nFor almost 20 years the little settlement at Pembina was the only\r\nfarming community in the State. Dakota Territory had been opened to\r\nsettlement January 1, 1863, and free lands were offered to anyone over\r\n21 years of age who would cultivate and improve his 160-acre homestead,\r\nand live on it 5 years. If he wished, he could also obtain a tree claim\r\nof 160 acres.\r\n\r\nTen acres of this quarter-section had to be planted in trees, and\r\nproof, substantiated by two reliable witnesses, that the trees had\r\nbeen growing for eight years was necessary before the settler could\r\nobtain clear title to the claim. The acquisition of tree claims was\r\nsometimes hindered by the perpetration of a cruel hoax on newcomers.\r\nOne of a group of unprincipled men, interested in money rather than\r\nin settlement of the land, and unable or unwilling to file claims,\r\nwould approach a new settler and offer him a \"deal\" on a piece of\r\nland, ostensibly planted as a tree claim, with the little green tree\r\nshoots already appearing above the ground. The settler would pay a\r\nsubstantial sum for the advantage of having trees already planted, and\r\nin good faith would file on the claim, only to find later in the year\r\nthat instead of a 10-acre grove he had an excellent but over-abundant\r\ncrop of turnips. Notwithstanding such discouragements, many fine groves\r\nwere planted which have not only added greatly to the beauty of the Red\r\nRiver Valley and central North Dakota, but have been invaluable as a\r\nprotection against soil erosion.\r\n\r\nA third tract of 160 acres could be secured under the preemption laws\r\nwhich permitted the settler to locate on land before or after it was\r\nsurveyed, file declaration of intent to purchase, and pay for the\r\nland within 18 months after filing, at the rate of $2.50 an acre for\r\nrailroad property or $1.25 for any other land. Additional land could\r\nbe obtained by buying up grants to soldiers in the United States Army.\r\nMilitary land warrants could be purchased for a nominal price, often as\r\nlow as 50 cents an acre.\r\n\r\nAt first, despite the ease of obtaining land, there was no great influx\r\nof settlers into the new land. The Nation was in the grip of the\r\nCivil War, and Indian troubles in the West not only discouraged new\r\nsettlement but frightened out many who had already made their homes\r\nthere. Writers who had visited the Territory depicted it as \"a land of\r\nblizzards and Indians, drought and grasshoppers.\"\r\n\r\nMoreover, homesteading in the northern part of the Territory was\r\ncomplicated by the fact that the nearest land office was at Vermilion,\r\n400 miles away, a long and perilous trip in the day of the oxcart and\r\ndogsled. The only surveyed land was in the vicinity of Pembina. Here in\r\n1868 Joseph Rolette, pioneer fur trader and settler, filed the first\r\nhomestead in North Dakota, the only one before 1870. In 1871 a few more\r\nclaims were filed, but it was not until 1885 that settlement increased\r\nto any great extent. During that year so many \"took up\" land that\r\nDakota Territory became known as \"the land of the free and the home of\r\nthe boomer ... free homesteaders and town site boomers.\"\r\n\r\nThe extension of the Northern Pacific across the Red River into North\r\nDakota was partly responsible for this sudden increase in population.\r\nImmigrants found it easier to reach the lands which the Government\r\noffered them. The Northern Pacific had been given by Government grant\r\nalternate sections of land for a distance of 20 miles on each side\r\nof its right-of-way. The land between these sections was opened to\r\nhomesteading; and since the free lands were just as desirable as\r\nits own, the railroad could find no market for its property. It was\r\ndecided, therefore, that the only way to profit on its investment was\r\nto encourage settlement, so that there would be an increased need of\r\ntransportation in and out of the new country. In lieu of its stocks,\r\nwhich had slumped in the panic of 1873, the road sold some of its\r\nenterprising stockholders large portions of its land grants for 40 and\r\n50 cents an acre. Among those persuaded to invest were G. W. Cass,\r\nB. P. Cheney, and Oliver Dalrymple. The three formed a company and\r\nplaced their 12,000 acres, in the vicinity of Fargo, under Dalrymple's\r\nmanagement. Thus was formed the first bonanza farm, initiating an\r\nimportant era in the agricultural history of North Dakota.\r\n\r\nThe chief purpose of the early bonanza farms was to demonstrate on a\r\nspectacular scale the potential wealth of the Red River Valley. The\r\nfarms ranged in size from 3,000 acres to the 65,000-acre Grandin farm\r\nwhich covered more than 100 sections of land. Wheat was the sole crop.\r\nAll operations were conducted on a large scale, with dozens of the most\r\nup-to-date farm machines working on the various divisions of the farms\r\nsimultaneously, and huge crews of a hundred or more employed during\r\nthe harvest season. Tales of the bumper crops were soon spread by the\r\ntransient harvest \"hands,\" and visitors and home seekers came from far\r\nand wide to see whether the stories of the fabulous crops were actually\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nTwo new inventions added to the success of the wheat-raising bonanza\r\nfarms. The first of these was the purifier, which made it possible to\r\nproduce a superior grade of white flour from spring wheat. The second\r\nwas a roller simplifying the milling of hard wheat, with the result\r\nthat this grain was placed at a premium. In a single year, the value of\r\nthe farms was raised from the original 40 and 50 cents to $5 an acre,\r\nand by 1906 the lands were worth from $30 to $40.\r\n\r\nBecause they raised a single crop, the managers of the bonanza farms\r\nfound it easy to systematize and mechanize their work. The newest farm\r\nmachines were common in this newly settled area long before they were\r\nintroduced in the older States.\r\n\r\nEastern syndicates usually owned the bonanza farms, and resident\r\nmanagers were engaged to supervise the work. As long as only wheat was\r\nraised, the system was ideal. With the introduction of other crops,\r\nhowever, difficulties arose, principally because stockholders could\r\nnot agree on a plan of operation. Almost all of the large farms were\r\neventually broken into smaller plots and sold to the immigrants and\r\neasterners whom they had attracted to the West. Today, 51,149 of the\r\n84,606 farms in the State are operated by their owners, 33,122 by\r\ntenants, and only 335 by managers.\r\n\r\nThousands who were attracted by the success of the bonanza farms\r\nand the low railroad rates came west to take up land, and were\r\naided in their preparation by the _Emigrant's Guide_, published by\r\nthe Commissioner of Immigration for Dakota Territory in 1870. This\r\ncontained not only such valuable information as data on the land laws,\r\nfarming methods, and transportation facilities, but also freight rates\r\nand a list of prices of staple commodities to indicate supplies which\r\nshould be brought from the East and those which could be as cheaply\r\npurchased in the new land. Tea was one of the most expensive of pioneer\r\ncommodities, ranging in price from $1.25 and $2 a pound. Sugar was also\r\nhigh--from 12 to 16 cents a pound. For light, the homesteader had a\r\nchoice of candles at 25 cents a pound or coal oil at 80 cents a gallon.\r\nFurniture, too, could be purchased by those who did not wish to carry\r\nit across the prairies from their eastern homes. Extension tables sold\r\nfor $2 a foot, washstands cost from $4.50 to $10. Ox yokes were $3, a\r\ndouble harness $45. So many homesteading necessities could be purchased\r\nat the pioneer settlements that after reading Dakota newspapers of this\r\nperiod a North Carolina editor announced that \"the people are fully up\r\nto the highest notch of civilization.\"\r\n\r\nAs the lands of the Red River Valley and the Drift Plain were occupied,\r\nsettlers were forced to go farther west into the farming-grazing belt\r\nof the Missouri Coteau. Influenced by the fortunes being made in wheat\r\nin the eastern part of the State, they too became wheat farmers. But\r\nalthough the soil of the Missouri Coteau is almost as rich as that\r\nfarther east, it does not have the same advantageous rainfall during\r\nthe growing season; and while it produced successfully, it did not have\r\nthe spectacular production of the bonanza farms in the black-earth area.\r\n\r\nToday, the farms in this region are somewhat larger than those of\r\nthe more easterly belt, being from 450 to 600 acres in size, but\r\nthe relative production is lower. Although grain farming still\r\npredominates, ideally the farming-grazing region is, especially in dry\r\nyears, a livestock section.\r\n\r\nTo the west of this central region lies the Missouri Slope, which\r\nconstitutes the grazing-forage belt. Originally the farms here were\r\nmuch smaller than those in other parts of the State--with the repeal in\r\n1891 of tree claim and preemption laws, homesteaders were limited to\r\n160 acres of free land. For a few years the settlers on the Missouri\r\nSlope were able to file on desert claims, receiving one section at\r\n$1.25 an acre with the understanding that they would improve the land\r\nby irrigation; but so many people throughout the arid regions of the\r\nUnited States filed on such claims fraudulently that the act was\r\nfinally amended to include the requirement that at least $3 an acre\r\nmust be spent for irrigation.\r\n\r\nDespite this land limitation, many new settlers came to western\r\nNorth Dakota during the \"back to the land\" movement from 1900 to\r\n1910. Besides the farmers who took up free land, there were many\r\nschool teachers, laborers, and business and professional persons who\r\nfollowed that method, or took a commuted homestead by filing on land,\r\nstaying there 14 months, and paying the Government $1.25 an acre. In\r\nthis region, where it is estimated that 30 percent of the land is\r\nnot suitable for cultivation, it was inevitable that many of these\r\ninexperienced persons should settle on worthless property. Experienced\r\nranchers and farmers realized that only large farms could be operated\r\nprofitably, and purchased homesteads from dissatisfied settlers. In\r\nthis manner the size of farms increased, until now they run to 800\r\nacres or more.\r\n\r\nThe most fertile soil of the western region is in the valley of the\r\nMissouri. It was here that Verendrye, Lewis and Clark, Catlin, and\r\nother early explorers found the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara women\r\ncarefully cultivating their neat fields of corn, beans, squash,\r\npumpkin, melons, and sunflowers.\r\n\r\nLack of rainfall is the chief drawback to successful agriculture in the\r\ngrazing-forage belt; but with irrigation, field crops can be raised\r\ndependably. The value of irrigation has been demonstrated by the\r\nsuccess of the 20,319 acres immediately west of the Yellowstone River\r\nin western North Dakota, an area irrigated by the Bureau of Reclamation\r\nproject of 1906. Similar projects are proposed in the basins of the\r\nKnife, Heart, and Grand Rivers.\r\n\r\nThe grazing-forage belt as a whole, however, is not well suited to\r\nagriculture. Texas cattlemen, driving their herds through western\r\nDakota to furnish beef for frontier military posts, saw its true value\r\nas a cattle country. The nutritive grasses and natural shelters make\r\nthis an ideal cattle-raising section.\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest ranchers were the Deffenbach brothers, who opened a\r\nranch in the extreme southwestern corner of the present State in 1878.\r\nOthers soon followed, including soldiers who had finished their period\r\nof enlistment in the western Army posts and were eager to settle in\r\nthe new land. Ranching of cattle and sheep became the industry of the\r\nwestern part of the State. As the natural range showed inroads of the\r\nnew industry, dry-farming was introduced, the chief crops being forage\r\nfor winter feed.\r\n\r\nThe land in the three North Dakota farm belts is still used primarily\r\nfor the purpose for which it was settled. The leading spring wheat\r\nState, North Dakota is second only to Kansas in the total wheat\r\nproduction of an average year. Hard spring wheat, particularly marquis\r\nand ceres, is an important crop, commanding a premium on the market\r\nbecause of high gluten content. Three-fourths of the Nation's durum, a\r\nhardy wheat used in the making of macaroni, is raised here. During the\r\nperiod of 1924-33, North Dakota wheat production averaged 78,737,682\r\nbushels a year. The State leads in rye and flax, and is outranked only\r\nby Minnesota in barley production. In production of grain seeds and\r\ncereal crops, respectively, the United States Department of Agriculture\r\nranks North Dakota third and seventh.\r\n\r\nLike the gold of the wheat, the blue of the flax flower has been part\r\nof the North Dakota picture since pioneer days. First planted for an\r\nimmediate cash income, flax has proved an ideal secondary crop because\r\nit extends the seeding and harvesting periods, and since 1900 it has\r\nbeen an established part of the cropping system of the North Central\r\nStates. One-half of the flax acreage in the United States is planted\r\nin North Dakota. As early as 1890, the State produced 458,117 bushels.\r\nBy 1900, the figure was raised to 13,478,283 bushels, and the 10-year\r\nannual average for 1924-33 was 5,081,157 bushels.\r\n\r\nWinter rye is extensively planted because of the protection it affords\r\nagainst erosion after a wet autumn. During the five years from 1927 to\r\n1931, an average of 1,196,000 bushels was harvested in North Dakota.\r\n\r\nA need for more feed crops for the cattle raised in the State has led\r\nto increased production of barley, oats, and emmer, grains which are\r\nused locally for feed. About 85 percent of the yield of barley is\r\nconsumed by hogs and lambs. Barley is also useful as a clean-up crop in\r\nthe control of annual weeds. The average annual production for 1924-33\r\nwas 27,227,284 bushels.\r\n\r\nThe same desire for an immediate cash crop which was the incentive\r\nto raise flax on the pioneer farms was largely responsible for the\r\nintroduction of potatoes and sugar beets. Potatoes had almost always\r\nbeen raised for local consumption, but no effort was made to produce\r\nthem in commercial quantities. Then a few enterprising farmers in\r\nthe Red River Valley planted large acreages, and were successful in\r\nmarketing the crops outside the State. Because of their high flavor,\r\nmealiness, and large uniform size, these northern potatoes command a\r\npremium on the market. One warehouse specializes in the shipping of\r\nhand-picked, wrapped potatoes, packed like apples or oranges, for sale\r\nto railways and other markets demanding fancy-grade potatoes. It is,\r\nhowever, for their seed value that North Dakota potatoes are noted.\r\nTheir low fiber content makes them ideal seed stock, and under Federal\r\nand State supervision they are certified for this purpose. In 1934\r\nNorth Dakota produced 6,140,254 bushels of seed potatoes. Exports that\r\nyear totaled 8,390 carloads.\r\n\r\nExperimentation showed that the soil which was good for northern\r\npotatoes was also excellent for sugar beets. The first crop of beets\r\nlarge enough to be listed in statistics for the State was 24,474 tons,\r\nharvested in 1924. By 1929 the tonnage had increased to 59,104. This\r\nis one crop which showed an increased production even in the dry year\r\nof 1934, when production totaled 82,304 tons, and beets were raised on\r\n13,466 acres on 485 farms. When the industry was first introduced, most\r\nof the labor was performed by Mexicans. Under contract to beet farmers,\r\ntrainloads of these people came north each spring. Not only did they\r\nwork for very low wages, but they also developed a quality of work\r\nrarely equaled by white beet workers. The cultivation and weeding of\r\nsugar beets is done almost entirely by hand, a long tedious process in\r\nthe blazing sun, which the Mexican worker seemed to mind not at all. In\r\nthe fall, most of them would pack their families into second-hand cars\r\npurchased with their summer earnings, and return south. Difficulties\r\nof these workers in adjusting themselves to northern modes of living\r\ndiscouraged the use of Mexican labor, however, and today only a few of\r\nthe larger farms still employ it. Most of the work is now carried on\r\nby local labor, often by school children. In driving through the Red\r\nRiver Valley, one can tell the farms on which sugar beets are a crop\r\nof many years' standing, for scarcely one of these is without an old\r\ntar-paper shack, a cook car remodeled into a house, or some other crude\r\ndwelling which was once the home of a family of Mexicans. In otherwise\r\nwell-kept farmyards, where the buildings are comparatively modern,\r\nthese laborers' dwellings are very decrepit and out-of-place.\r\n\r\nAlthough not a cash crop like potatoes and beets, corn has become\r\nincreasingly valuable in North Dakota. This is especially true in the\r\nsoutheastern part of the State, which is the hog-raising area of North\r\nDakota. During the five-year period of 1927-31, the average annual corn\r\nproduction was 20,200,000 bushels. Only in rare instances does North\r\nDakota corn reach the cash markets. It is not husked as in many of\r\nthe Corn Belt States; instead, the hogs and sometimes the cattle are\r\npermitted to feed directly on the stocks in the field. This is known as\r\nthe \"hogging down\" method of harvesting corn. About one-half the crop\r\nis cut annually for winter fodder.\r\n\r\nOther feed crops are also important on the North Dakota farm. Many\r\nhay and pasture crops, especially red clover and alfalfa, can be\r\nsuccessfully grown in the Red River Valley. In the western sections,\r\nalfalfa is raised for seed. Timothy and brome grass are also valuable\r\ngrass crops in the eastern area.\r\n\r\nIn 1914 sweet clover was cultivated only on demonstration farms;\r\nbut by 1929 an average of more than half a million acres was being\r\nseeded annually. Each year production of seed increased, reaching a\r\nhigh of 171,600 bushels in 1933. Sweet clover replaces nitrogen and\r\nother essential elements in soil which has been badly depleted by\r\noverproduction of wheat. One remarkable feature of this crop is its\r\nimmunity to disease and insect pests.\r\n\r\nSheep are found generally throughout the State, although the northern\r\npart of the Red River Valley and the southwestern corner of the\r\nMissouri Slope have proved the best sheep-raising land. The animals\r\nwere brought into the State when ranching first began here, and in 1933\r\nthere were 706,000 head of sheep and lambs shipped out of the State and\r\n15,000 slaughtered locally. In 1935 North Dakota ranked twenty-second\r\nin the number of sheep on farms and ranges.\r\n\r\nA true picture of cattle-raising in North Dakota can scarcely be gained\r\nfrom present conditions. The native grasses of the western part of\r\nthe State were unable to withstand the heat and insects of recent dry\r\nyears. As an emergency measure, thousands of cattle were shipped from\r\nwestern ranches to farms in the eastern and central part of the State,\r\nand even to other sections of the country where sufficient feed was\r\navailable to carry them through the winter. The number of cattle and\r\ncalves was reduced from 1,835,000 in 1934 to 1,157,000 in 1935. The\r\ndecrease in milk cows, since they are raised in the less arid sections\r\nof the State, has been much less than that in beef cattle. In 1934\r\nthere were 620,000 milk cows, while in 1935 the number was 596,000--a\r\ndrop of only 24,000. Thus, despite reverses, North Dakota was able to\r\nmaintain a position as twenty-first in the Nation in the cattle census\r\nof 1935.\r\n\r\nAlthough rarely conducted as an independent enterprise, poultry-raising\r\nhas had perhaps the greatest increase of any farm industry. Some type\r\nof fowl is raised on approximately 89 percent of the farms of the\r\nState. In 1929 North Dakota was listed second in the production of\r\nturkeys, twenty-fifth in poultry and eggs, thirteenth in ducks, and\r\nfourteenth in geese.\r\n\r\nPoultry organizations are active in the State. The North Dakota State\r\nPoultry Association has held annual shows since 1895, the All-American\r\nTurkey Show is held annually in Grand Forks, and there are numerous\r\nregional and county organizations. The North Dakota Farmers Union\r\nmaintains a poultry cooperative at Williston. North Dakota is second\r\nonly to Texas in supplying turkeys for the Thanksgiving and Christmas\r\ntables of the Nation.\r\n\r\nThe multitudes of wild flowers on the North Dakota prairies are an\r\nabundant source of honey; and with this natural incentive to its\r\ndevelopment, beekeeping has increased rapidly throughout the State.\r\nAlthough it can be successfully conducted in almost every part of the\r\nState, the most extensive areas are along the Missouri and in the Red\r\nRiver Valley. The sweet clover bloom is the chief source of honey, and\r\nyields abundantly in July and August. The number of bee colonies in the\r\nState increased from 32,000 in 1929 to 35,000 in 1932.\r\n\r\nAll of North Dakota was affected by the prolonged drought in the Great\r\nPlains States which began in 1929 and, except for one year, continued\r\nthrough 1936. High winds, intensive cultivation, and low rainfall\r\ncombined to create the most destructive period of soil erosion known\r\nto the State since its earliest settlement. This combination of\r\nconditions brought production in all farm products far below normal\r\nlevels. Even the Red River Valley, though it fared much better than the\r\nwestern part of the State, had subnormal rainfall and was subjected\r\nto frequent dust storms. To counteract the menace of drought to the\r\nprosperity of a primarily agricultural region, both State and Federal\r\nagencies began promotion of conservation in three forms: water, soil,\r\nand vegetation. Through the combined efforts of private groups and\r\ngovernmental agencies, ponds, marshes, lakes, and streams are being\r\nrestored. Some irrigation projects, both private and public, have\r\nproved fairly successful in the western counties. The contemplated\r\nMissouri River diversion projects, with the Grand, Knife, and Heart\r\nsub-projects, would lead to reclamation of a large area of North\r\nDakota. Planting hedges and forests to hold moisture in the soil and to\r\nprevent increased erosion constitutes the soil conservation program. To\r\nconserve vegetation, a program of dry-farming is recommended, including\r\nsummer fallowing and the planting of drought-resistant crops.\r\n\r\nVarious agencies are cooperating in a program to educate farmers in\r\nthese conservation plans. Extension workers, including county agents\r\nand their assistants, are employed by the United States Department\r\nof Agriculture to assist farmers. The agricultural college at\r\nFargo, the Northern Great Plains Field Station at Mandan, the State\r\nSchool of Forestry at Bottineau, and experimental stations and farms\r\nare constantly conducting soil conservation and moisture control\r\nexperiments designed to raise North Dakota agriculture to an even\r\nhigher rank.\r\n\r\n\r\nFARM LIFE\r\n\r\nThe fact that eastern and central North Dakota has been settled 25\r\nor 30 years longer than the western part of the State is evident\r\nin the appearance of the farms. The average eastern farm home has\r\nwell-painted and modernized buildings, surrounded by a neat lawn and\r\ngrove. Electricity is in use on many farms, being supplied from either\r\nan individually owned plant or a nearby power line. Telephones, radios,\r\nand cars are generally considered necessities. Since the farms are\r\nsmall and close together, and small towns are within a few miles of\r\none another, social contacts are easily maintained. Activities center\r\nin the towns, where farm women are members of clubs, lodges, and\r\nchurch societies, and the men of fraternal and civic organizations.\r\nConsolidated schools have supplanted many of the one-room buildings,\r\nand parent-teacher groups have a prominent social position. Libraries\r\nare found in many towns, and are patronized by rural as well as city\r\ndwellers.\r\n\r\nThe farms in central North Dakota are as a rule not as modern as those\r\nin the east, but on the whole are well kept. A somewhat different\r\npicture, however, is presented by the western farms and ranches. The\r\nsemiarid climate makes it difficult for even the most ambitious farmer\r\nto improve his place with trees, shrubs, grass, and flowers. Moreover,\r\nsince there were no tree claims in this part of the State, early\r\nsettlers did not have the incentive to plant groves. Periods of drought\r\nhave been felt more severely here, and have prevented many farmers\r\nfrom making modern improvements on their buildings. On some farms, the\r\nshacks erected to establish residence under the homestead act are still\r\nin use. There is, however, one modern convenience found more frequently\r\nin western rural homes than in those of the east--the furnace. The\r\nchief reason for this is the vast and accessible supply of lignite, a\r\nfuel which does not burn readily in stoves.\r\n\r\nSince farms in western North Dakota are large, homesteads are\r\nnecessarily far apart and social contacts cannot be made easily. The\r\nmajority of homes do not have telephones, because the market is limited\r\nto a few patrons and the cost is therefore prohibitive. The longer\r\ndistances to towns result in lack of interest in urban recreational,\r\nsocial, and church functions.\r\n\r\nThe one-room school predominates in western North Dakota. Libraries\r\nare few, and most of the people fail to take advantage of loaning\r\nfacilities offered by State libraries.\r\n\r\nFarm families in all parts of the State participate in various seasonal\r\nactivities. During the spring and summer months, school, church,\r\nclub, and old settlers picnics are scheduled frequently. When harvest\r\nseason arrives the farmer is exceptionally busy, but always has time\r\nto welcome the visitors from town, who come out to watch the threshers\r\nand often stay for a cook-car dinner. Later in the fall, especially in\r\nthe eastern counties, young people participate in strawstack parties.\r\nDances and card parties are held in community halls and barn lofts\r\nduring the winter.\r\n\r\nWinter activities are limited by heavy snowfalls, which often keep\r\ncommunities and farms snow-bound for days. Main-traveled highways\r\nare kept open except in unusually bad weather, but side roads are\r\noften drifted over for weeks at a time. Then the radio becomes the\r\nchief source of entertainment in the farm home; radio reception on\r\nthe open prairie is exceptionally good. In winter the western farmers\r\nhave an advantage over those of the east, for they get less snowfall,\r\nand chinooks (warm dry winds which descend from the Rocky Mountains)\r\noften temper the weather and melt the snow, permitting social life to\r\ncontinue almost uninterrupted.\r\n\r\nIn every rural community \"fair week\" is an important date. Farmers\r\ntake their best cattle, hogs, sheep, and poultry to compete with their\r\nneighbors' entries for the prized blue ribbons. Farm women select their\r\nfinest handiwork, their choicest jars of jellies, jams, and pickles,\r\nto enter in competition. Cookies, cakes, and pies are baked both to\r\nexhibit and to fill the picnic baskets, for when the family goes to\r\nthe fair everyone is prepared to spend the day; one or two hurry home\r\nin the evening to do the chores, and return in time for the grandstand\r\nevents at night. Almost every county has its annual fair in June or\r\nJuly, the oldest being the Pembina County Fair, which has been held\r\nat Hamilton each year since 1894. Even before this Pembina County\r\nFair, a State fair under State subsidy was being held annually in\r\nGrand Forks, where the citizens had donated 80 acres of land for that\r\npurpose. When the first State legislature met, it created a department\r\nof agriculture, one of the duties of which was to hold an annual\r\nagricultural exhibit. Now State help is also received by the fair\r\nassociations at Fargo and Minot.\r\n\r\nIncreasingly popular in recent years are the harvest festivals in\r\nvarious towns. These are held in September and October, when the garden\r\nproducts have reached maturity, and therefore often surpass the earlier\r\nfairs in the quality of exhibits. The junior chambers of commerce of\r\nthe State sponsor a Golden Grain Festival which is held the latter part\r\nof August, each year in a different city of the State. In September\r\ncomes the Grand Forks Harvest Festival, and the extension division of\r\nthe agricultural college sponsors a similar event in Fargo early in\r\nOctober. Bismarck is the scene of the annual Corn Show in October.\r\n\r\nAlfalfa Day at Fessenden in March features displays of alfalfa hay and\r\nseed, and also includes small grains, corn, and potatoes. The midwinter\r\nfair at Park River is sponsored by the Walsh County Agricultural\r\nCollege, and consists of exhibits from farmers throughout the Red River\r\nValley. Other outstanding exhibits include the Barnes County Corn and\r\nLamb Show held in Valley City the fourth week in September, and the\r\nEmmons County Breeders Association Stock Show which takes place in\r\nHazelton each June.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDUSTRY AND LABOR\r\n\r\n\r\nOn any cold winter night in the early 1800's it was not uncommon to\r\nsee a fur trader set out from Pembina, with his dogsled loaded with\r\nvaluable pelts, to make the long trek to St. Paul or Fort Garry. With\r\nno roads, few landmarks, and the constant danger of Indian attack, such\r\na night trip was extremely hazardous. Daylight, however, presented\r\neven more dangers, for the reflection of the winter sun upon the snowy\r\nground often caused snow-blindness; daytime temperatures softened the\r\ndrifts so that the dogs sank deep into them, while at night they could\r\nskim easily over the frozen surface. Despite the dangers of the fur\r\ntrade, many men engaged in it, taking their cargoes to the frontier\r\ncities and bringing back sled-loads of supplies to be exchanged for the\r\nfurs that Indians brought to the trading posts.\r\n\r\nThe first stores were at these posts, where the Indians came to barter\r\nfor blankets, trinkets, food, and alcohol, using the valuable beaver\r\nskin as the standard of reckoning. To avoid long discussions over the\r\nprice of goods, the traders devised a system of marking which could be\r\nreadily understood by the natives: a single horizontal line drawn on an\r\narticle indicated a value of one beaver skin, two parallel lines placed\r\nthe price at two skins, and so on. The quality of some English-made\r\nblankets is still designated by a survival of this early system, with\r\nlines known as \"points\" woven into the border.\r\n\r\nFrom this frontier commerce, North Dakota industry grew. In 1909, a\r\ncentury after the fur trade began, the State produced goods valued at\r\n$19,150,000; and in 1935 manufactures were valued at $40,076,326, with\r\n325 establishments each doing an annual business of $5,000 or more, and\r\ncollectively employing 3,306 workers. Although these figures are small\r\nin comparison with those of essentially industrial States, they are\r\nlarge in view of the youthfulness of North Dakota and its distinctly\r\nagricultural economy.\r\n\r\nThe fur trade prospered until the Indian insurrections of 1863-64.\r\nThen trapping became a perilous occupation, and traders and trappers\r\nreturned East. Eastward, too, went most of the settlers who had come\r\nto farm. The only ones to remain were Charles Cavileer and his little\r\ncolony at Pembina, who staunchly continued to cultivate their level\r\nfarms in the face of Indian dangers. With the exception of a few brave\r\nadventurers, they had the entire area virtually to themselves, until\r\nthe extension of the Northern Pacific lines into the Red River Valley\r\nin 1871 promoted a period of homesteading. Then, for the first time,\r\nagriculture took its place as the leading occupation of this area.\r\n\r\nMany of the industries which were important during the development of\r\nthe State are no longer in existence. Because lumber was an expensive\r\ncommodity to import, sawmills were established at Grand Forks and Fargo\r\nin the 1870's; and because the North Dakota side of the Red River could\r\nnot furnish a large enough supply for the mills, logs were floated down\r\nfrom the Minnesota woods. Lumberjacking meant cash and wages, and many\r\nhomesteaders left their families in possession of their claims while\r\nthey went to Minnesota to earn money for seed and machinery and for\r\nbuilding permanent homes on their farms. As traffic on the Red River\r\nincreased, construction of steamers became an important industry for\r\nwhich North Dakota mills supplied much of the lumber.\r\n\r\nOn the prairies west of the Red River Valley, the homesteaders could\r\nnot engage in logging and lumbering to earn money for improving their\r\nfarms; but, resourcefully, they found another way to get funds.\r\nBuffalo bones were scattered abundantly upon the land from Devils Lake\r\nwestward, and cash prices of eight to ten dollars a carload were paid\r\nby sugar manufacturers who used the bones in a refining process. Many\r\nhomes were built and much machinery purchased with the income derived\r\nfrom gathering and selling this material. Gradually, however, these\r\npioneer occupations died out. The more efficient railway supplanted the\r\nriver steamers. The supply of buffalo bones was soon exhausted. New\r\noccupations, allied with the expanding agriculture of the region, grew\r\ninto importance.\r\n\r\nThe first farmers here found the lack of transportation and marketing\r\nfacilities a great problem. Fort Garry and St. Paul were the nearest\r\nmarkets for grain until 1851. In that year Father Belcourt, who had\r\nestablished a mission where the town of Walhalla now stands, found that\r\nsufficient power could be obtained from the Pembina River there to\r\noperate a small flour mill. The mill was built, and farmers came from\r\nas far east as Pembina to patronize it. Generally, however, there was a\r\nlack of mills throughout the region. Elevators and shipping points were\r\nfar apart, and many farmers had to drive their wagonloads of grain from\r\n25 to 100 miles to market. When the railroads were extended westward,\r\nelevators were built in the towns and at sidings, greatly simplifying\r\nthe marketing problem. The new freight lines made it possible for\r\nmills to import fuel from the East, but unfortunately the cost of\r\nshipment was prohibitive. The development of North Dakota lignite\r\nmines, beginning in the 1880's, removed an important handicap to mill\r\noperation, however, and later the lowering of freight rates allowed\r\nimportation of other fuel. Although a large proportion of North Dakota\r\ngrain is still shipped out, there are now in the State 27 flour mills\r\nwhich in 1931 had an output valued at $12,000,000. The largest of these\r\nis the State-owned mill and elevator opened at Grand Forks in 1922 as\r\npart of the Nonpartisan League program of State industries.\r\n\r\nOne of the important industries which has grown out of the agriculture\r\nof North Dakota is seed production. Potatoes, clover, alfalfa,\r\nbrome-grass, and corn are shipped out in large quantities. A number of\r\nnurseries ship trees, plants, and shrubs.\r\n\r\nA French nobleman, the Marquis de Mores, was the first person to\r\nrealize the possibilities of a packing plant in North Dakota. Drawing\r\nupon his own and his father-in-law's resources, he established a plant\r\nat Medora in 1883. The venture failed, partly because his grass-fed\r\nbeef, produced at a high cost because of his artless business methods,\r\ncould not compete with grain-fed meat; but today modern packing plants\r\nat Grand Forks and West Fargo prove that the marquis was not the\r\nimpractical dreamer his contemporaries thought him.\r\n\r\nSince most of North Dakota's industry is concerned with the processing\r\nof agricultural products, no large manufacturing centers have been\r\ndeveloped; but mills, warehouses, poultry markets, and creameries have\r\nbeen established near the areas which they serve--many of the finest\r\ncreameries are in sparsely settled rural areas. Fargo is the only city\r\nin the State that manufactures other than agricultural products.\r\n\r\nDifficulties in shipping grain to outside markets provided one of the\r\nchief factors in the development of the many cooperatives which are\r\nimportant in the present economic life of the State. Grain farmers\r\nearly realized that by acting independently they could not trade\r\nadvantageously with eastern buyers. By 1891 there were ten farmers'\r\nelevators in the State, and the cooperative movement grew until the\r\nEquity Association, the National Producers Alliance, and the Better\r\nFarming Association developed the North Dakota division of the Farmers\r\nEducational and Cooperative Union of America, which at present includes\r\nsome 540 buying and consumers' cooperatives in the State. At first\r\nexclusively grain-selling organizations, the cooperatives have expanded\r\nto include the handling of twine, machinery, petroleum products, tires,\r\nelectricity, dairy products, and groceries.\r\n\r\nThe period since the World War has seen the revival of the occupation\r\nof the first white settlers--the fur industry. Some trapping is\r\ndone each winter, but the fur sellers today do not rely upon this\r\nnineteenth-century method of getting pelts. Instead they have farms on\r\nwhich they raise the furbearing animals, usually silver-black foxes.\r\nThe climate is well suited to this industry, for the cold winters\r\nproduce heavy and valuable furs.\r\n\r\nAlthough agriculture and its allied industries will probably always\r\npredominate, recent years have seen the beginning of the development\r\nof North Dakota's great mineral resources, which lay neglected\r\nor unrecognized for years while farmers attempted to emulate the\r\nphenomenal success of the bonanza wheat growers.\r\n\r\nRanchers in the western counties early discovered large deposits of\r\nlignite, a black or brownish substance in a stage between peat and\r\nbituminous coal, lying at or near the surface of the earth. Lignite\r\nhas a conspicuously woody appearance, often showing clearly the grain\r\nof the wood or the shape of the trunks and branches from which it\r\nwas formed. It is known to underlie the entire western part of the\r\nState. For many years its use was entirely local, chiefly because it\r\ncontains a large amount of moisture which evaporates upon exposure to\r\nthe air, causing the coal to crumble. To overcome this difficulty,\r\nshipment is now made in closed boxcars; briquetting of lignite has also\r\nproved successful, and the mineral is now common fuel. Lignite is used\r\nexclusively by State institutions and by many of the manufacturing\r\nconcerns in the State. In the eight-month period from November 1, 1935,\r\nto June 30, 1936, the production of 355 mines, amounted to 1,704,983\r\ntons, valued at $2,077,800.15. New mines are continually being opened.\r\nThe rapidity with which the industry has been developed is demonstrated\r\nby the fact that there were 67 more mines in operation in 1935 than in\r\n1931, with production in 1935 twice that of 1924 and eight times that\r\nof 1908.\r\n\r\nThe interest of the university school of mines in lignite\r\nexperimentation did not end with the perfecting of the briquet process.\r\nThe most recent achievement of the school is the production from\r\nlignite of activated carbon, a substance (hitherto produced largely\r\nfrom animal bones) used in water purification, sugar refining, rubber\r\ntire manufacture, and other commercial processes. The development of\r\nthis product should furnish a new and profitable industry for western\r\nNorth Dakota.\r\n\r\nWestern North Dakota has, in addition to its lignite beds, large\r\ndeposits of clay. These, like lignite, engaged the interest of the\r\nlate Dean E. J. Babcock of the university school of mines, and largely\r\nas a result of his efforts are being developed. Upon his urging, a\r\nceramics department was created at the university in 1910 to determine\r\nthe commercial value of native clays. From experiments conducted,\r\nit was found that certain varieties made excellent brick, tile, and\r\nother building materials, while others were especially suitable for\r\npottery. Reproductions of fine European pottery and original pieces\r\nof local design turned out at the university have attracted attention\r\nat exhibitions throughout the United States. Large-scale commercial\r\ndevelopment of the State's clay deposits is centered at Dickinson,\r\nwhere both building materials and pottery are produced.\r\n\r\nSodium sulphate and bentonite are two of the more recent mineral\r\ndiscoveries in North Dakota. In the southwestern part of the State\r\nare large beds of bentonite which, because close to the surface, are\r\neasily accessible for commercial purposes. Bentonite is used in the\r\nmanufacture of paint, rubber, soap, cosmetics, dynamite, and a variety\r\nof other products; it has also been found to give rich gold and brown\r\ntones to decorative designs on pottery. The chalky-white crystals\r\nof sodium sulphate, sometimes known as Glauber's salts, are found\r\nin few places in the United States outside of the old lake beds of\r\nnorthwestern North Dakota. Sodium sulphate is principally used in the\r\nmanufacture of paper. Millions of tons of it are easily accessible in\r\nthe open lake beds where it has been deposited by springs.\r\n\r\nDevelopment of mineral resources should help to solve the unemployment\r\nproblem of the State--a problem which is constantly growing. Except in\r\nrecent years, residents have had no difficulty in finding work, because\r\nagricultural pursuits usually require the same amount of labor year\r\nafter year regardless of agricultural prices. Despite this, new factors\r\nare increasing unemployment. In the period between 1930 and 1935, North\r\nDakota was the only State in the spring wheat belt to show an increase\r\nin population. Another primary cause of increasing unemployment is the\r\nsteadily growing percentage of persons over 40 years of age: in 1900,\r\n18.4 percent of the population was over 40, in 1920 this had increased\r\nto 20.8 percent, and in 1930 to 25.6 percent.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with the comparative unimportance of the State labor\r\nmovement at present is the small number of labor unions in North\r\nDakota. The State's first labor organization was the Bismarck\r\nTypographical Union, chartered in 1883. In 1906 the American Federation\r\nof Labor granted a charter to the Fargo Trades and Labor Assembly, and\r\nin 1911 the State Federation was officially organized. Branches of the\r\nlatter have since been formed in almost all of the larger towns in the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nState regulation of labor conditions had its beginning in 1907 with\r\nthe passage of a Workmen's Compensation Act. Many revisions have since\r\nbeen made in this law. A State welfare commission was formed in 1917\r\nto regulate labor conditions; and two years later, partly through the\r\nefforts of this commission, a minimum wage law was passed and placed\r\nunder the administration of the Workmen's Compensation Bureau. At\r\nthe same time provision was made for regulating the wages and hours\r\nof women laborers. In 1936 North Dakota was the only State having an\r\neight-and-one-half hour day provision for women in factories, stores,\r\nhotels, laundries, cafes, and telephone and telegraph offices.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n                                           ANCIENT INDIAN TURTLE EFFIGY\r\n\r\n  _Photo by Russell Reid_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n                                                          SIOUX\r\n                                                          SUN DANCE\r\n                                                          AS ORIGINALLY\r\n                                                          PERFORMED\r\n\r\n  _Copy of an old drawing courtesy of Frank Fiske_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n                                    A MODERN SIOUX SUN DANCE CEREMONIAL\r\n\r\n  _Photo by Paul S. Bliss_]\r\n\r\n[Map: NORTH DAKOTA IN 1879, FROM AN OLD MAP OF DAKOTA TERRITORY]\r\n\r\nThe first State child-labor act was passed in 1909. Under the present\r\nlaw, employment of children under the age of 14 is prohibited. The\r\nproposed child-labor amendment to the Constitution of the United States\r\nwas ratified by the North Dakota Legislature at the 1931 session.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRACIAL GROUPS AND FOLKWAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nInternational repute as a farming State brought North Dakota a steady\r\nstream of immigration up to the time of the World War. Tales of the\r\nrich wheatlands of Dakota drew a continuous procession of settlers with\r\ntheir household goods from the eastern States and from across the sea,\r\nto claim a share of the fertile western acres.\r\n\r\nLittle more than two decades has passed since this influx ceased. The\r\nState presents a patchwork of foreign groups, each still retaining\r\nmany Old World customs of speech, dress, and social life. Cultural\r\nassimilation, however, has slowly veneered the life of the State with\r\nan American character which is gradually seeping into and supplanting\r\nthe ways of the Old World.\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of foreign speech and customs seems quite justified by\r\nthe 1930 census, which showed 105,148 persons, or 15.5 percent of the\r\ntotal population of 680,845, to be of foreign birth. In addition to\r\nthis number, a still larger portion of the population, 45.4 percent,\r\nis first-generation American, born of foreign parents and therefore in\r\nclose contact with the speech and customs of its fathers during its\r\nformative years.\r\n\r\nForty-two countries, most of them European, have contributed to the\r\nforeign-born population of North Dakota. Norway has the largest\r\nrepresentation, followed in order of numbers by Russia, Germany,\r\nCanada, Sweden, and other countries, including the Netherlands,\r\nDenmark, Hungary, Finland, Rumania, and Iceland.\r\n\r\nUnfavorable social and economic conditions among the rural population\r\nof Norway, coupled with harsh military regulations, prompted most of\r\nthe Norwegian emigration to the United States. North Dakota was the\r\nnatural choice of many whose families had, for generations, lived\r\nupon the land. Norwegian stock today constitutes 30 percent of the\r\npopulation of the State, and persons born in Norway make up 29.8\r\npercent of its foreign-born population. Their settlements have been\r\nmade throughout the northern and eastern sections of the State. In\r\ncontrast with many other national groups, the Norwegians show little\r\ntendency to localize, and while predominant in many communities they\r\nmanifest no aversion to settling where other groups are already\r\nrepresented.\r\n\r\nThe hospitality of the Norwegians is their greatest distinction. The\r\ncoffeepot is always in use, and, coffee and pastries made from Old\r\nCountry recipes are served whenever anyone chances into a Norwegian\r\nhome, as well as at meals and between meals. The Norwegians have a\r\ncharming way of bidding each other \"_Tak for sidst_,\" meaning \"Thanks\r\nfor the last time I met you.\"\r\n\r\nThey retain to a marked degree their native tongue in its various\r\ndialects or _bygdespraag_, widely mixed with the English language. They\r\nare fond of music, and mountain waltz melodies, polkas, and spring\r\ndances, played on the accordion or violin, are enjoyed by young and old\r\nalike. The Hardanger violin, which has eight strings, is still made\r\nand played by the older musicians. The adult Norwegian, being very\r\nindependent by nature, does not readily fit into an orchestra or large\r\nchorus; such organizations are more common among the younger people.\r\n\r\nThe most fantastic of the Norwegian dances is the Halling Dance, still\r\nseen on special occasions. It is reputedly the survival of a \"dance\r\nof death\" from the days when the knife was the means of avenging\r\njealousies among the young men of Halling Valley in Norway. When a\r\nman began the intricate acrobatic steps of the Halling Dance, the\r\nother dancers knew he had seen an enemy or rival in the crowd, and\r\nunobtrusively withdrew to the edge of the dance floor, leaving the\r\nenemy, often unsuspecting, in the clear. Then, in a great whirl, the\r\nHalling dancer would send his knife spinning through the air with its\r\nmessage of death. The dance today is an acrobatic performance which\r\nrequires great skill. It includes handsprings, the _Halling-kast_--a\r\nwhirling and kicking step--and the _krukeng_, a jiglike step done in a\r\nhalf-sitting posture with the dancer moving about the floor.\r\n\r\nIn many Norwegian towns, _Jule Bokke_ or Christmas Fools still make\r\nthe rounds of the homes between Christmas and New Year. They are young\r\npeople dressed in costume and masked, who call on the neighbors and are\r\ngiven food and drink at each home visited.\r\n\r\nAmong the factors which keep alive the Old Country speech and manners\r\nare the _lager_ or societies, each of which represents a district in\r\nNorway. Members are former residents, or descendants of residents, of\r\nthe district. At their meetings, native music, dances, and costumes are\r\nrevived.\r\n\r\nA holiday in all Norwegian communities is the Seventeenth of May,\r\nNorway's Independence Day. The festivities usually include speeches,\r\npicnicking, and dancing.\r\n\r\nNorwegian influence has been felt in every phase of North Dakota life.\r\nAmong prominent figures in the State have been Paul Fjelde, sculptor;\r\nKonrad Elias Birkbough, who discovered a cure for erysipelas; Carl\r\nBen Eielson, pioneer Alaskan aviator; R. A. Nestos, A. G. Sorlie, and\r\nOle Olson, who became Governors of the State. In the business world,\r\nthe Norwegians have influenced the rapid growth of the cooperative\r\nmovement. Skiing, a Scandinavian sport, is a popular winter\r\nrecreation. The accordion, favorite of both the Norwegian and the\r\nGerman, is widely used in concert groups and dance bands. Foods which\r\nare commonly known, although not widely prepared outside the Norwegian\r\nhome, include _lutefisk_, which is cod cured in lye; _lefse_, an\r\nunleavened potato bread baked in great flat, rough, gray sheets on top\r\nof an iron range; and _fattigmand_, a pastry fried in deep fat.\r\n\r\nIn the first two decades of the nineteenth century there occurred\r\na German migration into Russia which was to be felt later in North\r\nDakota. Free lands offered by the Russian Government (desirous of\r\nhaving its people learn German farming methods) drew many Prussians\r\neager to escape the heavy taxation of their homeland. Throughout\r\nthe Black Sea area German colonies grew up; in later years these\r\ncontributed heavily to the stream of emigration to America. Today\r\nRusso-Germans dominate the Russian element, which forms 12.8 percent of\r\nthe total population of this State.\r\n\r\nBecause of this Russo-German constituency, the Russian and German\r\nracial groups in the State often overlap. Native Germans form 1.5\r\npercent, and persons of German stock 8 percent, of the population. The\r\nRusso-Germans first came to this State about 1889, settling in the\r\nsouth-central section, in McIntosh and Emmons Counties. Other Russian\r\nand Russo-German settlements are in the Missouri Slope and in the\r\ncentral area of the State. German groups are found in the southeastern\r\npart of the State, in Ward County in the northwestern area, and in\r\nMorton in the Slope region. Among outstanding Germans who have taken\r\npart in the development of the State are two Governors, George F.\r\nShafer and William Langer.\r\n\r\nIn its residence in Russia, the Russo-German group acquired many\r\ncustoms which now distinguish them from their German cousins, but\r\nthe two groups have much in common. They cling tenaciously to their\r\nnative tongue in their homes and churches; the Russo-Germans, however,\r\nspeak a dialect which is a result of their Russian residence. Both\r\ngroups retain Old Country customs of dress, most noticeable of which\r\nis the use of the _tuch_ or shawl worn by the women in place of a hat.\r\nOn Sundays and holidays some of the older women appear in beautiful\r\nhandworked _tuecher_ and full-skirted dresses typical of peasant\r\nEurope. White stockings are often worn by the older women on holidays.\r\nThe occasional appearance of a fez-like astrakhan cap during the winter\r\nbespeaks the Russian influence.\r\n\r\nAlthough the dress of the older Russo-Germans is rather somber,\r\ntheir homes are quite the opposite. Floors throughout the house are\r\ninvariably painted bright orange, this color scheme often extending to\r\nthe back and front porch and steps. The exteriors of the house and\r\nother buildings are likewise sometimes painted in bright colors, with\r\ncontrasting trimming. A not uncommon decorative scheme consists of two\r\nor three brilliant hues alternating in diagonal stripes across the\r\nsliding doors of garages, granaries, and barns. The interior of the\r\nsummer kitchen (which is to be found back of most farmhouses and many\r\ntown homes) is often painted in contrasting bright colors, one shade\r\nbeing used for a wainscoting effect, another for the top half of the\r\nwalls and the ceiling, and a third forming a dividing border. Because\r\nof American influences, the penchant for these bright colors has become\r\nmore subdued in recent years.\r\n\r\nA popular note in home decoration is the use of bright-colored\r\nartificial flowers, which often adorn curtains, picture frames, and the\r\norgan or piano in the Russo-German home.\r\n\r\nA typically Russian note is the common use of glass tumblers instead\r\nof cups for serving hot drinks. Another practice is the use of chicory\r\nas a substitute for coffee. A favorite delicacy of the Russo-Germans,\r\nalso typically Russian, is the sunflower seed, known as the \"Russian\r\npeanut.\" They eat these much as Americans eat peanuts. The sunflower\r\nseed is becoming popular as a confection throughout the State, and is\r\nnow roasted and packaged for sale, in contrast with the old method of\r\ndrying the ripe sunflower in the sun until the seeds could be brushed\r\nfrom the plant.\r\n\r\nOne of the most beautiful customs retained by the modern generation\r\nof Catholic Germans and Russo-Germans is the visit of the \"Christmas\r\nAngels.\" Three young girls, trained as a rule by nuns, go dressed as\r\nangels from home to home in the community on Christmas Eve. They knock\r\nfor admission, and when this is granted they enter the home, bless it,\r\nand sing one or two Christmas carols. For this service they are given a\r\nsmall amount of money. Another custom is the observance of \"Name Day,\"\r\nwhen, on the day of the saint for whom he is named, each person must\r\nhold open house for his friends. Callers greet the host or hostess with\r\n\"Happy Name Day.\" Birthdays, on the other hand, if they occur on a day\r\nother than the Name Day, are disregarded almost altogether.\r\n\r\nMany German families observe December 31 as \"Sylvester's Day.\" On\r\nthis day the last person arising is \"Sylvester\" or the lazy member of\r\nthe family for the coming year. Of course everyone in an industrious\r\nGerman family tries to avoid this stigma. Another New Year's custom\r\nis for all members of the family to leave through a rear door of the\r\nhome at midnight and reenter through a front door. The first person to\r\nenter the home after midnight is a herald of the coming year: if he is\r\nfair, the new year will bring good luck; but if he is dark, he augurs\r\nmisfortune.\r\n\r\nThe German people are fond of community music, and numerous bands and\r\nchoruses have organized almost spontaneously under leaders. They are\r\nespecially fond of song, and when a group of older people gathers for a\r\nsocial evening their chief pastime is often hymn singing. Much of the\r\nsocial life centers about the church, although in some communities the\r\n_verein_, or society, has many members and serves to keep alive the\r\nspeech and customs of the Old Country, much as does the Norwegian _lag_.\r\n\r\nTwo interesting German religious sects are the Moravians, represented\r\nin the area near Fargo, and the Dunkards or, as they are now known,\r\nDunkers, who have a settlement near Cando. One of the beautiful customs\r\nof the Moravians is the \"love feast,\" a survival of an early Christian\r\ncustom of breaking bread as an indication of brotherly love. The feast\r\ntoday generally consists of coffee and doughnuts, but the spirit is\r\nunchanged.\r\n\r\nThe Dunkers, or German Baptist Brethren, follow their early sectarian\r\nprecepts of plain dress and plain living. While few of the women still\r\nwear the \"dropped bonnet\"--a small grey or black sunbonnet--the prayer\r\ncovering or small lace cap is still worn during attendance at church\r\nservices. Older members of the colony hold to the early rulings of the\r\nchurch in carrying no form of insurance. In early October of each year\r\na harvest festival is held in the form of a religious observance.\r\n\r\nFrom both the Germanic and the Norwegian groups is derived the most\r\nprominent foreign contribution to the language of the State: the\r\nuniversal use of _ja_ (\"yah\") for _yes_.\r\n\r\nFew group characteristics attach to the Canadians, who constitute\r\n1.5 percent of North Dakota's foreign-born population, and are found\r\nin the northeast counties and the Red River Valley. Many of them are\r\ndescendants of the Selkirk colonists who settled from Fort Garry\r\nto Fort Pembina early in the nineteenth century. It is from these\r\ncolonists that most of the Scottish people in this State trace their\r\ndescent.\r\n\r\nFor the French-Canadians the most important festival of the year is St.\r\nAnn's Day, July 26. A shrine to St. Ann has been built by French and\r\nIndians at Belcourt on the Turtle Mountain Reservation, and here on\r\nthe saint's day come the lame, the halt, and the blind, to walk or be\r\ncarried in the processional. Many miracles have been claimed.\r\n\r\nIn French-Canadian communities in the Red River Valley, the colorful\r\nOld Country wedding customs are still observed. As the wedding march is\r\nplayed the bridal pair and their attendants enter, followed by young\r\nmen dressed in highly padded French costumes, and wearing grotesque\r\nmasks. They are in both male and female attire, and dance and cavort to\r\nthe delight of the guests.\r\n\r\nLike their Norwegian neighbors, the Swedes who have come to America\r\nare predominantly a rural people. In North Dakota they constitute 1.2\r\npercent of the total population, and are found in the eastern part of\r\nthe State, mainly in Cass County, and in the central section east of\r\nthe Missouri in Burleigh and McLean Counties.\r\n\r\nSmaller racial groups in the State include Hollanders, in Emmons County\r\nnear the south-central border; Danes, in the east-central counties of\r\nCass, Barnes, and Stutsman; Poles and Icelanders, in the northeast\r\nsection; Hungarians, in the Slope area; Czechs, in Richland and Walsh\r\nCounties in the Red River Valley and in Stark County in the Slope area;\r\nand many others, all showing a distinct tendency to localize.\r\n\r\nThrough their national societies, the Ukrainians in Burleigh, McLean,\r\nand Billings Counties in the western half of the State have retained\r\nmuch of the music, dances, and costumes of their native land. These are\r\nin evidence at their club meetings and also on holidays. The costumes\r\nare colorful and elaborate, and testify to the embroidering skill of\r\nthe girls.\r\n\r\nThe Bohemians in Richland and Walsh Counties likewise are noted for\r\ntheir musical organizations, but they do not retain their native\r\ncostumes or dances. The _sokol_ or physical culture group is found in\r\nmany of the Bohemian communities.\r\n\r\nThe _sauna_ or steam bathhouse is a characteristic feature of the\r\nFinnish settlements in the southern and western sections of the State.\r\nWater sprinkled on a large brick stove or on heated rocks provides\r\nthe steam for these baths, which are stifling on first trial but\r\nsoon become a pleasing habit. The Finns, like the Norwegians, serve\r\ncoffee to all guests who come to their homes, no matter what the hour.\r\nCoffee is drunk from the saucer, through a lump of sugar held in the\r\ncheek. Two holidays which are still celebrated in Old Country style\r\nare Midsummer's Day and New Year's. Midsummer's Day, June 24, is an\r\noccasion of picnicking, church services, confirmation of scholars,\r\nsettling arguments or quarrels, and pitching horseshoes. On New Year's\r\nEve, fortunes are told by dropping bits of melted soldering metal into\r\ncold water. One piece, melted and hardened before midnight, is a symbol\r\nof the old year; and the process is repeated with another piece after\r\nthe stroke of midnight, to foretell the fortunes of the new year.\r\n\r\nBoth the Irish and the Icelanders continue to hand down their legends\r\nwhich have been brought from Europe. Icelandic children usually are\r\nwell posted on the national sagas, including the _alfa sorgur_, which\r\ntell of the _huldu_ folk or elves; and no Irish child is so poor as to\r\nbe deprived of the ghosts, the banshees, the leprechauns, and other\r\nweird creatures of the Emerald Isle.\r\n\r\nAt Ross, in northwestern North Dakota, is a small colony of Syrians,\r\nmost of whom are Ahmadiyya Moslems. They have their own place of\r\nworship, and conduct services each Friday as well as on other holy\r\ndays. They retain many food customs of the Near East, one of the most\r\ninteresting being the use of a meal made by crushing durum wheat which\r\nhas been boiled and dried in the sun. The meal is then stewed with\r\nmeats or vegetables or sweet oils.\r\n\r\nThe sugar beet industry of the Red River Valley has resulted in the\r\nimportation of Mexican workers, who provide cheap and skilled labor for\r\ncultivation of the beet fields. The Mexican population is not large,\r\nhowever, having decreased greatly from the 1930 figure of 600, and\r\nhas left no permanent imprint of its folklore or customs. The Negro\r\npopulation, never large, is also rapidly decreasing. The 1930 census\r\nshowed 377 Negroes in the State.\r\n\r\nAlthough not foreign-born, the Indian population constitutes a distinct\r\nracial group. Sioux and Rolette Counties, containing the Standing\r\nRock and Turtle Mountain groups, have the greater part of the Indian\r\npopulation and consequently register the highest illiteracy in the\r\nState, from 7 to 8 percent. Other counties usually have an illiteracy\r\nrate of less than 1 percent, and sometimes less than half of 1 percent.\r\n\r\nThe Indians retain many racial customs and legends despite the\r\nencroachment of the white man's civilization. The metis, of French and\r\nChippewa blood, were famous as hunters and trappers. Many of them were\r\nfound in the upper Red River Valley and adjoining territory about 1850.\r\nTheir descendants now live in small clay-plastered log houses, with\r\nmuch of their household equipment and bedding kept in the yard.\r\n\r\nMany of North Dakota's characteristic folkways represent foreign\r\ncultures rather than anything intrinsically American. There is no\r\nlack, however, of native customs which are gradually absorbing and\r\nsupplanting the Old World ways.\r\n\r\nBecause North Dakota is a farm State, many of its customs hinge on\r\ncertain matters of rural importance such as the weather and the crops.\r\nWhether or not the farm people are able or inclined to attend is\r\nthe greatest factor in the success of most social and civic events.\r\nSaturday night is the farmer's night in town, a welcome holiday after\r\nhis week of isolation and work. Shops and garages become social as\r\nwell as commercial centers, as friends stop to exchange news, gossip,\r\nand recipes. In many communities, Saturday night dances are held,\r\nand during the summer months a vacant lot will often be the scene of\r\nopen-air motion pictures, with the spectators seated in their parked\r\ncars and blowing the horns in lieu of applause when the pictures meet\r\nwith approval.\r\n\r\nIn addition to such general holiday celebrations as Christmas, New\r\nYear, and Memorial Day, in the Norwegian sections of the State,\r\nNorwegian Independence Day, May 17, is also marked by festivity. Among\r\nthe Russo-Germans, Ascension Day is an unusually solemn holiday. At\r\nChristmas time, holiday decoration of homes is common, and groups\r\nof young people stroll about the streets or ride in sleighs singing\r\ncarols. New Year's Eve brings about the usual noisy gayety, and in many\r\ntowns it is customary to fire guns in a salute as the new year comes\r\nin. Watch parties are held in the churches for the more serious-minded.\r\n\r\nThe Fourth of July is an important holiday, not so much for its\r\nhistoric meaning as for its local interpretation. For days previously,\r\nthe skies are anxiously scanned for signs of inclement weather. As the\r\nGlorious Fourth dawns a salute is fired, usually by ex-servicemen, and\r\nsoon in the early morning air the sound of hammers is heard, as booths\r\nand \"concessions\" rapidly go up to be draped with bunting. Flags appear\r\non the buildings and homes. Cars begin to pour into town, parking\r\nnear Main Street, which has been roped off for the races. The square\r\nis soon filled with a milling crowd, all in their best clothes, the\r\nchildren clutching their long-hoarded pennies and nickels which they\r\nwill exchange for soda pop, ice cream, and firecrackers. The program of\r\nthe day includes patriotic speeches, airplane and parachute exhibits,\r\nraces, and bowery dances, and in the evening the climax of the exciting\r\nday--a fireworks display.\r\n\r\nThe Russo-Germans know the holiday simply as \"the July,\" and in a good\r\nyear it is an occasion for new clothes for the entire family, commonly\r\ndesignated \"July dresses\" and \"July suits.\"\r\n\r\nConviviality often joins with practical necessity to provide social\r\noccasions for North Dakotans. Butchering, sausage making, soap making,\r\nquilting, threshing, burials, illness, all furnish opportunity for\r\nfriends to meet and visit while performing some deed of necessity or\r\nkindness. The farmer who is ill during sowing time will often have his\r\ncrop put in by his neighbors, and he may be called on in the fall to\r\nhelp harvest for the recently bereaved widow of one of his friends. The\r\nneighbor who has lost his home by fire or has had some other misfortune\r\nwill probably be given a \"make-glad\" party, at which he will receive\r\ngifts in kind and perhaps in money. After harvest, when there is straw\r\nto be burned, the young people of the locality will hold strawstack\r\nparties, roasting wieners and marshmallows as the burning stacks light\r\nthe autumn night with their red gleam.\r\n\r\nSometimes, with the coming of dusk on winter evenings, bobsleighs slide\r\naway from darkened country homes, filled with all the members of the\r\nfamily, from grandparents down to babies. Often the sleigh will pick up\r\nadditional passengers at a nearby homestead, and sometimes it becomes\r\nso crowded that there is scarcely room for the boxes of sandwiches,\r\ncarefully wrapped cakes, and jars of pickles among the shuffling feet\r\nand heated rocks and bricks in the bottom of the sleigh. The singing\r\ncreak of the sleigh runners accompanies songs that boom out on the\r\nnight air. Presently a number of sleighs reach an appointed home, but\r\nthey do not pause long. Across the fields the light of a farmhouse\r\nwindow offers a prelude to their welcome. They become studiously quiet\r\nuntil they reach the door, then burst in with shouts of \"Surprise!\"\r\nThere follows a confusion of greetings and commands:\r\n\r\n\"Get a lantern.\"\r\n\r\n\"Put your horses in the east stall. John, show Henry where to put\r\nhis horses, and--hey, John, turn Jip and Molly out to make room for\r\nMillers' team.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bring in them sandwiches I brought, Helen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, heavens, you knew all about it--you're all dressed up and ready\r\nfor us. With the country line it ain't possible to surprise anyone.\"\r\n\r\n(Even where there is no country telephone line, it is considered\r\nsomething of a feat to catch the unsuspecting host or hostess napping.\r\nYet all North Dakotans like surprise parties, and have them on\r\nbirthdays, wedding anniversaries, and every other plausible occasion.)\r\n\r\nThe farmhouse is converted into a dual-purpose hall. The accordion is\r\nplaced near the stove to \"thaw out,\" wraps are deposited in corners, on\r\nchairs, and on beds, except the one reserved for the babies. Tables,\r\nthe drophead sewing machine, and everything else that will serve the\r\npurpose are arranged for card playing. One room is cleared for dancing.\r\nAfter the first spurt of conversation lags, the musician takes his\r\ninstrument on his knee, the floor is sprinkled with corn meal or grated\r\nparaffin, and soon the house is shaking from studding to rafter.\r\nSomeone suggests a quadrille, or square dance, and the room resounds\r\nwith the calls:\r\n\r\n    \"First two gents cross over\r\n    And leave your lady stand,\r\n    Side two gents cross over,\r\n    And take her by the hand.\r\n    Salute your corner lady,\r\n    Salute your partners all,\r\n    Swing the corner lady,\r\n    And promenade round the hall.\"\r\n\r\n    \"First couple to the right,\r\n    Birdie in the center and three hands round,\r\n    Birdie fly out and hunter step in.\r\n    Three hands round.\"\r\n\r\nAt midnight, after three or four hours of dancing and card playing,\r\n\"the ladies\" serve lunch. The hat is passed for contributions to the\r\nmusician, but he does not take the money until he is through playing,\r\nwhich is usually about 3 o'clock in the morning. Then, after a general\r\nbedlam of looking for mislaid coats, the babies are carefully wrapped,\r\nthe younger children are wakened and rub their eyes sleepily as they\r\nclimb into the sleighs, the empty cake plates and pickle jars are\r\ncollected, farewells are called, and horses, anxious to return to their\r\nown stalls, speed the drowsy parties home through the cold night.\r\n\r\nThe young people of the State usually have ample opportunity\r\nfor courting at such parties, or at meetings of junior church\r\norganizations, church camps, and junior choirs. Matchmaking still\r\nexists in isolated Russo-German, German, and Norwegian communities,\r\nhowever. Except in the larger towns--and sometimes even there--the\r\nnewly married pair is usually honored by a charivari, or \"chivaree,\"\r\nwith the bridal couple seated conspicuously on some slowly moving\r\nvehicle and taken through the streets to an accompaniment of blaring\r\nautomobile horns and clanging tin pans. The bridegroom is expected to\r\nclimax this procedure by buying drinks or cigars for the crowd.\r\n\r\nCigars are much in evidence at the birth of a first child, and also\r\nthereafter at the birth of a son. A child born with a caul is believed\r\nby many to have the gift of second sight, and it is also sometimes\r\nthought that the caul is a powerful fire-fighting weapon.\r\n\r\nSuperstitions attach to many other phases of life, as well as to\r\nbirths. Most of these beliefs are not peculiar to North Dakota, but\r\nare rather a part of the folklore of the Nation. A dropped spoon means\r\ncompany is coming, and so does the cat's washing its face. Snakes do\r\nnot die before sundown. A horse-hair put in water will turn into a\r\nsnake. The number of stars in the ring around the moon show the number\r\nof days before a coming storm. Plants which bear underground should be\r\nplanted in the dark of the moon, and those which bear above ground in\r\nthe light of the moon. A window shade rolling up when no one is near it\r\nportends a death in the family.\r\n\r\nMany of the myriad superstitions are not believed, but nevertheless\r\ncontinue to be passed on. There is some belief in ghosts and occult\r\npowers, and scarcely any community is without the story of a strange\r\ndeath and a haunted house--such as the tale of the doctor who was\r\nmysteriously killed on a farm near Wilton and whose ghostly galloping\r\nteam disturbed the farmer so much that he was forced to move. These\r\nstories, however, are often not credited but merely passed on for\r\neffect. As for fortune tellers, the most popular prophets are those\r\nwho deal, not with tall dark men and long trips, but with isobars\r\nand isotherms, for the interests of agricultural North Dakotans are\r\ninseparable from the weather, which governs their destinies far more\r\nsurely than any other factor in their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHOOLS, CHURCHES, AND SOCIAL CURRENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nFor many years education and religion in North Dakota were closely\r\nassociated, for the earliest schools were organized by priests. The\r\nScottish Highlanders of North Dakota's first white settlement--the\r\nSelkirk colony at Pembina--were a highly religious peasant people\r\nwho keenly felt the absence of churches and schools in the land to\r\nwhich they had migrated. Their sponsor, Lord Selkirk, also felt that\r\na church would add to the harmony and stability of the community, and\r\noffered to contribute 25 acres for a church and 20 square miles for a\r\nschool and mission if the Bishop of Quebec would approve a church at\r\nPembina. The bishop acceded, and in 1818 Father Joseph Dumoulin, Father\r\nJoseph Provencher, and William Edge, a catechist, arrived to establish\r\nchurches and schools, and study the \"savage languages\" in order to\r\n\"reduce those languages to regular principles so as to be able to\r\npublish a grammar after some years of residence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEDUCATION\r\n\r\nThe first school in North Dakota, at Pembina, had an enrollment\r\nof 60 children, white and half-breed, and courses in English were\r\nsupplemented by lessons in planting small grains, both intended for the\r\nenlightenment of the \"savage\" Chippewa. The school was conducted until\r\n1823, when, after the determination of the international boundary, many\r\nof the Selkirkers moved north to Canada, thus breaking up the colony.\r\nThe missionaries were withdrawn, and the school and chapel remained\r\nclosed for a quarter century. When Father George Belcourt came to the\r\nregion in 1848, he reopened the Pembina Mission and founded another at\r\nSt. Joseph in the Pembina Mountains. A school conducted at St. Joseph\r\nby the Sisters of the Propagation of the Faith received financial\r\naid from the Federal Government, the first Federal support given to\r\neducation in this State.\r\n\r\nIn the early settlements of the State, a mother would often gather the\r\nchildren of the neighborhood in her home for instruction, and itinerant\r\nteachers occasionally held classes in the tent cities which sprang\r\nup in the wake of the railroad. As the communities grew, residents\r\ncooperated in hiring teachers and building schools. The railroad\r\ncompanies assisted by shipping lumber free for schools. Between 1853\r\nand the attainment of statehood in 1889, 1,362 schools were opened,\r\nmany of them in country communities, taught by men or women who had\r\ncome West to homestead. A teacher's report on one such school, sent\r\nto the superintendent of the Griggs County schools in 1886, recorded\r\nthat he had taught a 62-day term, with 15 pupils enrolled and daily\r\naverage attendance of 7 7/31; that his salary was $35 a month; and that\r\nthe school building and grounds were in good condition, the former\r\ncontaining a \"Webster's Unabridged Dictionary, New 8-Inch Terrestrial\r\nGlobe, New Forms and Solids for object Teaching and Two Slate black\r\nboards.\"\r\n\r\nBy 1883 two institutions of higher education had been founded in the\r\nnorthern half of Dakota Territory. Jamestown College, the first school\r\nin the State to offer a normal course, had been established by the\r\nPresbyterian Church, and three months later the Territorial assembly\r\nvoted to found a University of North Dakota at Grand Forks. Originally\r\na liberal arts college, this institution extended its curriculum\r\nuntil, in 1889, it included a law school, a college of mechanical\r\nengineering, and a school of mines. In its first year the university\r\nhad an enrollment of 79; during 1936, 2,555 attended classes or took\r\ncorrespondence work in its six colleges.\r\n\r\nSeveral private colleges were opened prior to 1889, and the Enabling\r\nAct of that year provided for the establishment of an agricultural\r\ncollege and normal schools. Like the other private institutions,\r\nJamestown College was forced to close its doors during the financial\r\npanic of 1893. Reopened in 1909, it is now the only endowed liberal\r\narts college in the State. The effects of the 1893 depression on the\r\nuniversity and normal schools were accentuated by the vetoing of the\r\nappropriations for a two-year period. Weathering this crisis, the State\r\ncolleges and university reached an enrollment of 2,000 in 1904, and by\r\n1936 their total registration exceeded 10,000.\r\n\r\nNotable in educational history was the affiliation in 1905 of the\r\nuniversity and Wesley College, a Methodist school originally located at\r\nWahpeton. Similar affiliations were later made among other colleges,\r\nincluding the North Dakota Agricultural College, where the Wesley\r\nCollege buildings are now used for an interdenominational school of\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nTo comply with the provision of the Enabling Act requiring\r\nestablishment and maintenance of a public school system open to all\r\nchildren and free from sectarian control, the first legislature set\r\nup an education department administered by three branches--a State\r\nsuperintendent, county superintendents, and district boards. It also\r\ncreated a tuition fund from the proceeds of school lands, supplemented\r\nby poll taxes, school taxes levied by general law, and all fines for\r\nviolation of State statutes. The money from these sources was made\r\navailable to all schools in which the English language was taught.\r\n\r\nThe school lands to which the law referred were received by the State\r\nin accordance with the plan of the Federal act of 1785 granting each\r\nnew State carved from the Ohio Territory section 16 of each township\r\nfor public school support. For North and South Dakota, under the\r\nEnabling Act, this grant was doubled, giving the schools one-eighteenth\r\nof all land surveyed. Town site boomers and speculators in other States\r\ncommonly took advantage of school land grants to buy property at prices\r\nfar below the actual value; but in the Dakotas they were forestalled\r\nby the alert Territorial superintendent of schools, W. H. H. Beadle,\r\nwho incorporated into the constitutions of both States the provision\r\nthat school lands might not be sold at less than $10 an acre, and might\r\nbe leased as hay or grazing lands but not for cultivation, and that\r\nthe title of western coal lands included in the grant must always be\r\nretained by the State. Similarly guarded were 750,000 acres of land\r\ngranted to other educational institutions. So successful was Beadle's\r\nplan that it has been adopted by almost every other State admitted to\r\nthe Union since 1889.\r\n\r\nAt the State School of Science at Wahpeton, opened in 1903 as a trade\r\nschool and junior college, two methods of industrial education have\r\nbeen originated, the Babcock plan and the North Dakota plan, both of\r\nwhich have attracted the attention of educators throughout the United\r\nStates. The former provides for the establishment of three departments\r\nwithin the school--a trade school, a junior college, and a business\r\nschool, each of which, by a plan of interaction, is made to serve\r\nthe others. The North Dakota plan, evolved to solve the problem of\r\nproviding industrial education in an agricultural State, concentrates\r\nall trades education in one school, with the exception of night courses\r\noffered at other points in the State under the supervision of the\r\nschool of science.\r\n\r\nA second junior college was established in 1925 at the school of\r\nforestry in Bottineau. North Dakota is now one of the 27 States which\r\nhave junior colleges.\r\n\r\nTwenty parochial schools, most of them maintained by the Roman Catholic\r\nor the Lutheran Church, offer grade and high school work, and are\r\ngoverned by the State department of public instruction.\r\n\r\nUnder the supervision of the board of administration, the State\r\nsupports a school for the deaf at Devils Lake, a school for the blind\r\nat Bathgate, and an institution for feeble-minded at Grafton. The board\r\nalso has jurisdiction over the hospital for the insane at Jamestown,\r\nthe training school for delinquents at Mandan, the penitentiary at\r\nBismarck, and a sanatorium at San Haven. Several semi-public homes and\r\norphanages are operated by churches and other organizations.\r\n\r\nIt is compulsory for all children between the ages of 7 and 15 to\r\nattend school, and a student who has not completed the eighth grade\r\nmust continue in school until he is 17 years of age. Agriculture is a\r\ncompulsory course in public schools. Free textbooks are provided for\r\nrural schools, and uniform texts are prescribed for all public schools.\r\n\r\nA school census taken in June 1930 showed North Dakota to have a\r\nschool-age population of 222,798, of whom 169,277 were enrolled in\r\npublic schools--139,580 in elementary, and 29,697 in high schools.\r\n\r\nIndian children are given grade and high school education and\r\nvocational training in special schools at Fort Totten, Fort Yates,\r\nElbowoods, Belcourt, and Wahpeton. Preservation of tribal arts,\r\nincluding beadwork and pottery, is encouraged.\r\n\r\nThe North Dakota educational system is greatly influenced by the\r\nagrarian character of the State. Because children are needed for farm\r\nwork, most of the country schools are not opened until October, and\r\noperate for a term of only seven or eight months. A survey made in\r\nthe winter of 1923-24 showed a sharp decline in attendance records\r\nin rural schools, and consequently legislation was enacted providing\r\nfree transportation for pupils living more than two and one-half miles\r\nfrom school. The legislation affected two-fifths of the rural school\r\npopulation, and resulted in improved attendance in elementary schools.\r\nThe one-room school is still the most common type of educational\r\ninstitution in the State, although the number of consolidated schools\r\nis being increased annually. Sixty high schools, including the Benson\r\nand Walsh County Agricultural Schools, receive Federal aid through\r\nthe Smith-Hughes Act, which provides funds for vocational training\r\nand courses in agriculture. This act also enables the North Dakota\r\nAgricultural College in Fargo to operate extension service and\r\nexperimental stations, and to provide a State-wide educational program\r\nfor farmers.\r\n\r\nReading facilities in public schools were improved by the 1911\r\nlegislative appropriation of $25 to each school district for a\r\npermanent school library. In many communities these school libraries,\r\nsupplemented by the loan services offered by the State educational\r\ninstitutions and the traveling libraries of the State library\r\ncommission, are the only sources of reading material. The first public\r\nlibrary in the State was opened in 1897 in Grafton by a group of\r\nclubwomen, and many other towns have received similar benefit from the\r\nefforts of women's clubs to build up library collections.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELIGION\r\n\r\nThrough the influence of three prominent men in the Red River\r\nsettlement--Joseph Rolette, Norman Kittson, and Anton Gringas--Father\r\nBelcourt was able to maintain his Pembina Mission, establish another at\r\nSt. Joseph, and extend his work west to the Turtle Mountains. He held\r\nservices for Indians and hunters alike.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Protestantism was introduced into the State by James Tanner,\r\na half-breed interpreter from the Cass Lake (Minnesota) Reservation who\r\nhad become a Baptist minister. At his request, Rev. Alonzo Barnard came\r\nfrom the Presbyterian mission at Cass Lake to Pembina and St. Joseph\r\nlate in 1848. Barnard remained only a short time, being succeeded\r\nin 1850 by a young Baptist missionary, Elijah Terry, who was killed\r\nby hostile Sioux as he was cutting logs for a chapel. The following\r\nsummer Barnard returned, accompanied by his wife, David Spencer and\r\nhis family, and John Smith. Despite severe misfortune, including Mrs.\r\nBarnard's death from pneumonia, and the death of Mrs. Spencer, who was\r\npierced by an Indian arrow as she stood in the window of her cabin with\r\nher baby in her arms, the mission was kept open until 1858.\r\n\r\nExcept for occasional visits by priests and ministers from Canada to\r\nthe Pembina settlement, there was little further religious activity\r\nin North Dakota until 1871, when the Presbyterians again sent a\r\nminister into the Red River Valley. Oscar H. Elmer, who received the\r\nappointment, drove up and down the valley in a homemade cutter, and\r\nwas the first to conduct church services in many of the pioneer towns,\r\nincluding Fargo and Grand Forks.\r\n\r\nWhen the Episcopal Church decided to send a missionary into the newly\r\nsettled territory, the board, guided by the stories it had heard of\r\nDakota winters, recalled Rev. Robert Wainright from his mission in\r\nLabrador, feeling that his experience there should have qualified\r\nhim to serve in Dakota. Mr. Wainright took over the northern half of\r\nDakota Territory, and raised funds to carry on his work by appearing\r\nin Labrador costume and giving exhibitions of his skill with a 40-foot\r\nwhip, with which it is said he could flick water out of a glass.\r\n\r\nAs settlement increased, other church groups sent missionaries and\r\nministers. At first, services were held in homes, schools, or tents,\r\nand often a building used during the week as a saloon or gambling hall\r\nwould become a place of worship on Sunday. The ministerial duties\r\nfrequently included janitor work, and since the remuneration usually\r\nconsisted of donations from the parishioners, many of the ministers\r\nsupplemented this income by operating small farms. The hardships\r\nof pioneer days led to much resourcefulness on the part of early\r\nchurchgoers. Gopher tails were saved and placed on the collection plate\r\nby those who had no cash to give, for the church could then claim the\r\nthree-cent bounty on gophers offered by the State. As communities grew,\r\nnew church buildings were erected, until now some of the most notable\r\nstructures in the State are churches. Religious colonies came to North\r\nDakota to settle, and Mennonite, Dunkard, Moravian, and Mohammedan\r\nare among the approximately 25 creeds represented in the State. Most\r\ninfluential are the Lutheran (due to the large number of Scandinavian\r\nsettlers) and the Roman Catholic.\r\n\r\nThe actual number of churches is decreasing as parishes are enlarged,\r\nand in smaller towns and rural sections the consolidation of churches\r\nhas been found practical.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOCIAL CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nA movement in 1915 for increased social legislation resulted in the\r\npassage of mothers' pension, juvenile court, and old age pension acts,\r\nand in the abolition of capital punishment except in the case of a\r\nconvict already serving a life sentence for murder.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the general trend of prison populations throughout\r\nthe United States, that of the North Dakota penitentiary has\r\nsteadily decreased until in 1935-36 it reached the lowest figure\r\nin 10 years--274. Most of the decline has occurred in the number\r\nof non-residents of the State committed, probably due to the fact\r\nthat, with poorer crops, employment of transient farm labor has\r\nbeen unnecessary, and the annual influx of transients has therefore\r\ndecreased.\r\n\r\nImpetus was added to the program against juvenile delinquency in\r\n1921 by the publication of the results of a five-year survey which\r\nshowed that more than 500 children were brought into court annually.\r\nLaws regarding juvenile delinquency were made more stringent. The\r\nreform school at Mandan was renamed the State Training School, and\r\na corresponding change was effected in the methods of handling\r\ndelinquents sent there. From a juvenile prison the institution became\r\nvirtually a boarding school in which boys and girls between the ages of\r\n12 and 21 supplement regular grade and high school work and vocational\r\ntraining with such extracurricular activities as music, dramatics,\r\nathletics, and club work.\r\n\r\nSince the survey revealed that, while only 5 percent of the child\r\npopulation of the State lived in three cities having a population of\r\nmore than 10,000, these cities reported 45 percent of the delinquency,\r\nsocial service groups in all cities were enlisted to deal with the\r\nproblem. New emphasis was placed on character-building organizations\r\nsuch as Boy and Girl Scouts, Campfire Girls, Y. M. C. A., and Y. W.\r\nC. A.; playgrounds were opened, and recreational programs promoted.\r\nThe American Legion formed a Junior Baseball League for boys under 17\r\nyears of age, which was so successful that in many communities boys who\r\ngraduated from the junior teams are now receiving civic support in the\r\norganization of intermediate and senior clubs.\r\n\r\nNorth Dakota's moderate temperature and dry air came in for early\r\nprominence in the advertisements of promoters, who assured prospective\r\nsettlers that this was one of the most healthful States in the Union.\r\nIt was a fortunate circumstance that they were correct, for lack of\r\ntransportation facilities and the limited number of doctors often made\r\nit impossible for settlers to obtain medical aid. Today the number\r\nof doctors is adequate for the population, but their tendency to\r\nconcentrate in the larger towns leaves many western rural communities,\r\nand a few in the east, with no medical aid within many miles. Despite\r\nthis uneven distribution of doctors, North Dakota has always had a good\r\nhealth record. Since there are no large cities, contagious diseases do\r\nnot spread rapidly and epidemics are comparatively rare. In 1935 the\r\nState had a record of 8.0 deaths per thousand of population, while the\r\nfigure for the United States as a whole was 10.7. The highest death\r\nrate is among the Indians, tuberculosis being the most prevalent cause.\r\nLargely through the efforts of Dean H. E. French of the university\r\nschool of medicine, a State health department was established in 1923,\r\nand has set up a health program and secured passage of laws providing\r\nfor medical inspection in public schools, creation of a board of\r\nexaminers for nurses, registration of nurses, and employment of county\r\nnurses.\r\n\r\nThe work of State agencies for the care of children and aged or\r\nphysically handicapped persons is coordinated through the State welfare\r\nboard. Under the provisions of revised legislation enacted in 1935, the\r\nboard distributed 7,431 old age pensions, and in 1936 inaugurated a\r\nprogram for the aid of the blind which, within a single year, provided\r\nvocational education and other assistance for 150 people not enrolled\r\nin the State school at Bathgate.\r\n\r\nIn conjunction with the Children's Bureau, created in 1923, and local\r\nlodge groups throughout the State, the welfare board holds clinics\r\nfor physically handicapped children, provides them with medical\r\ncare whenever possible, and helps them learn trades. Similar work\r\nwith adults is carried on by the State department of vocational\r\neducation and rehabilitation organized in 1921. Of the 124 handicapped\r\nindividuals who received training through the facilities of the\r\ndepartment in 1935-36, 45 were placed in employment.\r\n\r\nStringent pure food and drug acts were drafted for the State by the\r\nlate Dr. Edwin F. Ladd, an outstanding figure in the field of public\r\nhealth, who as United States Senator from North Dakota drew up some\r\nof the Federal pure food laws. A regulatory department maintains\r\na laboratory where foodstuffs and other products are tested for\r\ncompliance with State laws. The department of public health also has\r\nlaboratories throughout the State, and several cities have their own\r\nfacilities for testing water supplies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen in 1738 the intrepid French-Canadian, Pierre Verendrye, his three\r\nsons, and his nephew set out on foot to trudge weary miles across the\r\nprairies to the Mantannes on the Missouri River, they did not dream\r\nthat some day man-made birds would flash their silver wings against\r\nthe sky and glide smoothly to rest on the level plains. Less than 200\r\nyears were to pass before this miracle of transportation progress would\r\nbecome so commonplace that a native North Dakotan would think nothing\r\nof a trip from Montreal to Bismarck by plane, but would be astonished\r\nat the thought of anyone's walking that distance.\r\n\r\nVerendrye, the first white man known to have touched North Dakota\r\nsoil, and other explorers who followed in those early years, came on\r\nfoot to visit the Indians. They found the Mandans, who lived beside\r\nthe Missouri, in possession of unusual means of water transportation.\r\nThe dugout canoe, made of a log, was found on all the rivers of\r\nNorth Dakota, but only in the Missouri Valley did the Indians use\r\nthe bullboat, a circular craft of the coracle type which the Indians\r\nmade by stretching a buffalo hide over a willow frame. Before the\r\nintroduction of the horse, Indians used the dog train for hauling heavy\r\nloads overland, but when the Sioux migrated into this territory from\r\nthe south and east they brought the horse with them. Of all tribes the\r\nSioux were the most graceful and daring riders. The horse travois, a\r\nrather crude means of hauling baggage devised by the Indians, soon gave\r\nway to the white man's wagon as settlers began to pour in.\r\n\r\nThe covered wagon served to move the immigrant family to its new home,\r\nand furnished immediate living quarters. In the Red River country\r\nbefore 1820, the oxcart, made entirely of wood with cross sections of a\r\nround log for wheels, was introduced at Pembina. Long creaking trains\r\nof these carts drawn by oxen made their way slowly across the country\r\ncarrying settlers and supplies.\r\n\r\nBefore the coming of modern means of transportation, the Missouri\r\nRiver formed the most important avenue of entry into what is now North\r\nDakota. The ascent of the river by the steamboat _Yellowstone_ to Fort\r\nUnion in 1832 was an event of importance, because the Big Muddy had\r\nnever before been navigated through this territory.\r\n\r\nThe Indians who witnessed the coming of this first boat found great\r\nsignificance in it also. According to George Catlin, the artist,\r\nwho was aboard the steamer, some of them shot their dogs and horses\r\nin a sacrifice to appease the Great Spirit, whom they thought to\r\nbe offended; some ran frightened to their homes; and some among the\r\nMandans cautiously approached the ship, \"the big medicine canoe with\r\neyes\", which in some mysterious way could see its own way to take the\r\ndeep water in the middle of the channel.\r\n\r\nThe frequently changing channel and swift current of the river proved\r\na severe test for the hardy and resourceful pilots who followed in the\r\nwake of the _Yellowstone_. As the Sioux City (Iowa) _Register_ stated\r\nin 1868, \"Of all the variable things in creation the most uncertain are\r\nthe action of a jury, the state of a woman's mind, and the condition of\r\nthe Missouri River.\"\r\n\r\nThe humorist George Fitch, as quoted in Edna LaMoore Waldo's _Dakota_,\r\ndescribes the stream in these words:\r\n\r\n  \"There is only one river with a personality, a sense of humor,\r\n  and a woman's caprice; a river that goes traveling sidewise, that\r\n  interferes in politics, rearranges geography and dabbles in real\r\n  estate; a river that plays hide-and-seek with you today, and\r\n  tomorrow follows you around like a pet dog with a dynamite cracker\r\n  tied to his tail. That river is the Missouri.\"\r\n\r\nA pilot familiar with the river, and able to foresee its vagaries,\r\noften received--and was easily worth--$1,000 a month, fabulous as that\r\nsalary may now seem.\r\n\r\nThe Red River was also a highway of traffic in the heyday of the\r\nsteamboat. Supplies were carried down it to Grand Forks, Pembina, and\r\nWinnipeg (then Fort Garry). The steamboat could be employed only during\r\nthe summer months, however, when the river was open. During the winters\r\nin the 1870's, messages, supplies, and mail were carried by pack\r\nhorse and dog sled. Regular mail routes were established between Fort\r\nAbercrombie and Fort Totten, and from St. Paul to Winnipeg, by way of\r\nPembina.\r\n\r\nAs news of the vast untouched, wealth of the new Territory drifted back\r\nto eastern capitalists, they turned their eyes westward. Soon survey\r\nparties mapped the projected courses of railroads. By 1871 the Northern\r\nPacific Railway had been completed as far as Moorhead, Minn. The next\r\nyear it crossed the river, and in 1873 reached Bismarck, halting at\r\nthe Missouri. It was no easy task to span this treacherous river; and,\r\nwith the interruption of the panic of 1873, not until 1879 was there\r\nany further westward extension. Construction work to the Montana border\r\nwas finished in 1881, two years before the Northern Pacific became a\r\ntranscontinental line. So great was the influence of the railroad in\r\nbringing new settlers to Dakota that in the period from 1870 to 1875\r\nthe population of the western half of the Red River Valley doubled.\r\n\r\nGeneral Custer's expedition returned from the Black Hills in 1874 with\r\nglowing tales of gold. There was a rush for the Hills, and Bismarck,\r\nthe nearest railroad terminus, became temporary headquarters for\r\nparties leaving by stage for the gold fields. The route that Custer\r\nhad taken to the Hills from Bismarck was long known as the Territorial\r\nHighway.\r\n\r\nAlthough James J. Hill was one of the first to sponsor steamboat\r\ntraffic on the Red River, it was not until 1880 that he began building\r\nthe Great Northern Railway down the Red River Valley to Grand Forks,\r\nand thence westward to Minot in 1887. Other lines of the Northern\r\nPacific and Great Northern, main and branch lines of the Minneapolis,\r\nSt. Paul & Sault Ste. Marie, and branches of other roads soon entered\r\nthe State. In order to build permanent business for their lines, they\r\nbrought in new settlers, gave special rates on household and farm\r\nequipment, and in every way encouraged settlement. It was because of\r\nthe railroads that bonanza farming, an important phase of North Dakota\r\nhistory, was introduced. The State is now served by seven railroads,\r\nwith more than 5,000 miles of trackage. The Dakota Division of the\r\nGreat Northern, with its 1,800 miles of main-line track, is the largest\r\nrailroad division in the world.\r\n\r\nWith the railroads came the telegraph lines, the first of which was\r\nestablished between Winnipeg and Abercrombie, with offices at Fargo\r\nand Grand Forks, in 1871. Soon all of the young Territory was in\r\ncommunication with the outside world.\r\n\r\nThe colorful era of the steamboat had ended with the coming of the\r\ncheaper and speedier transportation by rail, but methods of local\r\ntransportation remained unaltered. The horse still furnished the power,\r\nalthough fashions in wagons and buggies might change.\r\n\r\nIt was left for the twentieth century to usher in the age of speed. In\r\nthe first decade, the wheezing steam automobile chugged with difficulty\r\nover sticky gumbo roads in the Red River Valley, and over scoria trails\r\nin the west. Automobiles were rare, and possession of one marked the\r\nowner as an aristocrat or a public nuisance, according to the point of\r\nview of the observer.\r\n\r\nWhen the internal combustion motor vehicle was improved, road building\r\nbegan in earnest. Bus companies, established to fill a need for north\r\nand south transportation facilities not provided by the railroads,\r\nopened a campaign for better roads. They were joined by an ever\r\nincreasing number of car owners, and as a result road conditions have\r\nbeen steadily improved since the early 1920's.\r\n\r\nThe first bus line in the State was begun in 1922, between Bismarck\r\nand Minot. Although the next two years saw the introduction of many\r\nbus and truck lines, these were not regulated by State law until\r\nplaced under jurisdiction of the board of railway commissioners by\r\nlegislative act in 1925. Immediately, operating permits were required\r\nfrom all companies, one of the first being granted to the Northland\r\nTransportation Company, forerunner of the Northland Greyhound Line.\r\nToday a network of bus and truck lines covers the State.\r\n\r\nThe airplane proved admirably suited to this part of the country. The\r\nclear dry atmosphere afforded ideal flying conditions, and almost\r\nevery part of the State was suitable for landing fields, even without\r\nimprovement. Municipalities became interested in the new mode of\r\ntransportation, hangars were built, and runways laid out. Now all of\r\nthe larger cities and towns have airports, and almost every small town\r\nhas its landing field. Private planes are found at the airports, and\r\nhere and there ships are seen on farms, where mechanically minded lads\r\npilot them in leisure hours for their own pleasure. All planes and\r\npilots must be licensed under a State law of 1929, as well as conform\r\nto the regulations of the Department of Commerce.\r\n\r\nCheering crowds at Fargo, Grand Forks, and Pembina greeted the\r\npilots of the first air mail between the Twin Cities and Winnipeg in\r\n1928. Hundreds of letters and cards were carried on this flight for\r\ncollectors who desired copies of the special commemorative cancellation\r\nstamp. North Dakotans' air mail letters now reach Washington, D. C. or\r\nLos Angeles 12 hours after mailing. Daily service on the original line\r\nis still maintained, and two other regular lines have been extended\r\ninto the State, one between Chicago and Seattle which stops at Fargo\r\nand Bismarck, the other from Bismarck to Tulsa, Okla.\r\n\r\nTransportation has advanced with amazing rapidity since the Territory\r\nof Dakota was organized in 1861. Nevertheless, a severe winter such as\r\nthat of 1935-36 is capable of halting communication almost completely.\r\nBut even then, with automobile traffic at a standstill because of\r\nblocked roads, trains delayed because of mountainous snowdrifts, and\r\nplanes grounded because snow and ice made landing too hazardous, the\r\nradio still kept the State in constant touch with the outside world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESS AND RADIO\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether or not the first printing press in North Dakota, brought to\r\nSt. Joseph (Walhalla) by Rev. Alonzo Barnard in 1848, was ever used in\r\nthe State is a matter of conjecture. When Mr. Barnard, a Presbyterian\r\nminister, was transferred to Dakota, he took his press--a gift from\r\nstudents at Oberlin College--overland from the Cass Lake (Minnesota)\r\nReservation to Red Lake, by canoe across the lake and down the Red Lake\r\nand Red Rivers to Pembina, then by oxcart to St. Joe. Here he may have\r\nused it, as he did in Minnesota, to publish news letters and pamphlets\r\nfor his parishioners, but nothing printed on it in North Dakota has\r\nbeen preserved.\r\n\r\nThe first North Dakota publication was probably the _Frontier Scout_,\r\na short-lived four-page, three-column sheet which made its appearance\r\nat Fort Union in July 1864. In the following year its successor, the\r\n_Pioneer Scout_, was issued at Fort Rice and, according to its editors,\r\n\"published weekly by the First U. S. V. Infantry for the edification\r\nof the people of Dacotah, both civilized and savage; and as 'green'\r\nspots and 'green' backs are so few, we will not mention terms, but bid\r\nit, like the grace of God, go free.\" The editors further declared that\r\n\"every article in this paper is original and sees the light of day for\r\nthe first time.\"\r\n\r\nJournalistic activity lapsed subsequent to these military literary\r\nefforts, and was not revived until the railroad and the resultant\r\ninflux of settlers in 1872 brought the new Territory to the attention\r\nof Minnesota editors. Col. Clement A. Lounsberry, sent by the\r\nMinneapolis _Tribune_ to cover colonization in the Fargo area, went\r\non to Bismarck where, on July 11, 1873, the first number of his own\r\npaper, the Bismarck _Tribune_, appeared. First a weekly and later a\r\ndaily, it has been published continuously since that time, missing only\r\none edition, and on that occasion newsboys distributed hastily printed\r\nhandbills containing formal notice that the _Tribune_ plant had been\r\ndestroyed by fire (_see_ BISMARCK).\r\n\r\nEarly journalism in the Fargo area was stimulated by the offer of the\r\nWells-Fargo Express Company to give a cash bonus for a paper appearing\r\nunder the name of the Fargo _Express_. First and unsuccessful bidder\r\nfor the bonus was a sheet bearing the correct name, but printed at\r\nGlyndon, Minn. The prize was awarded in 1874 to a Fargo-printed\r\npublication. Between 1874 and 1891 several other papers were issued, to\r\nbe merged finally in the Fargo _Forum_ in 1891.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 the Grand Forks _Plaindealer_ was founded; five years later\r\nthe _Herald_ was also in the field, and eventually absorbed the\r\n_Plaindealer_ (_see_ GRAND FORKS).\r\n\r\nWith the beginning of settlement newspapers sprang up quickly in the\r\nother new towns of Dakota, so that when North Dakota was admitted to\r\nthe Union in 1889, it had 125 periodicals. Many so-called newspapers\r\nwere nothing more than a final proof-sheet, printed in order that\r\nsettlers might comply with the homesteading law which required\r\npublication of notice of final claim. The cost of establishing such\r\na paper was slight. Official notices, an occasional advertisement,\r\nand a few local news items were all it contained. If the editor could\r\nwin the favor of the United States Land Office registrar, who usually\r\ndesignated the official paper, he might obtain one hundred or more\r\nnotices an issue; these at $5 each made his income quite substantial.\r\nOften the paper was short-lived, but the editor usually remained in the\r\nState, setting up his type cases and presses in some promising small\r\ntown and starting an actual weekly paper. Many villages had two or\r\nmore rival papers for a time, and the number of publications increased\r\nrapidly; in 1904 there were 265 in the State, and in 1919 a high of 336\r\nwas reached. The weekly papers were widely read and often had great\r\npolitical influence.\r\n\r\nImproved transportation facilities, however, led to the retreat of\r\nthe weeklies before the increasing circulation of the daily papers.\r\nNorth Dakota now has 196 publications including 11 dailies and 4 trade\r\njournals.\r\n\r\nAlways active in the political life of the State, the newspapers have\r\nbeen an especially important factor in the Nonpartisan League fight.\r\nWith the daily press usually unanimously opposed to its program, the\r\nleague has purchased weeklies through which it has exercised a great\r\ninfluence on the rural population. Although it does not control as many\r\nweeklies now as it formerly did, it still has a strong hand in the\r\neditorial policies of many papers in the State.\r\n\r\nIn May 1922, less than two years after the first radio broadcast in\r\nthe United States had been put on the air by KDKA in Pittsburgh, WDAY\r\nof Fargo presented the first commercial broadcast in North Dakota. The\r\nState now has seven other stations, situated in Bismarck, Grand Forks,\r\nMinot, Devils Lake, Mandan, Valley City, and Jamestown.\r\n\r\nKFJM in Grand Forks is one of the few stations in the United States\r\nowned by a State university. It is leased to private operators with\r\nthe provision that its facilities be at the disposal of the school for\r\nspecial broadcasts and experimental work (_see_ GRAND FORKS).\r\n\r\nThe radio has made an important contribution to the State service by\r\nbroadcasting information on weather conditions whenever necessary.\r\nLives and thousands of dollars in property have been saved by warnings\r\nof spring floods. During the winter months frequent weather and highway\r\nreports are given, and warnings sent out regarding advisability of\r\nsending children to school during storms or extremely cold weather.\r\nIn November 1930 an unusual service was performed by the Fargo and\r\nBismarck stations. Heavy coatings of sleet had broken down telephone\r\nand telegraph wires throughout the State, and severed all communication\r\nbetween Fargo and Jamestown, division points on the Northern Pacific.\r\nDuring the first afternoon of the storm short-wave communication\r\nwas established between the Fargo transmitter and an amateur set at\r\nJamestown, but after sunset interference forced abandonment of this\r\nbroadcast. Receiving sets were quickly installed at the studios of the\r\nFargo and Bismarck stations, making possible a two-way conversation. On\r\nthe one available telephone connection between Jamestown and Bismarck\r\nthe dispatchers' office in Jamestown was hooked up with the Bismarck\r\nstudio, in Fargo the dispatcher was linked with WDAY, and for two days\r\nall trains on the line were dispatched by radio. Between train orders\r\nthe facilities of both stations were turned over to the telegraph\r\noffices, and Fargo alone sent out more than 200 messages.\r\n\r\nSeveral amateur stations were in operation before any commercial\r\nbroadcasting had been done in North Dakota. When the convention of the\r\nDakota Division of the American Radio Relay League was held in Fargo in\r\n1936, there were 300 licensed operators in attendance, and each year\r\nfinds an increased number of people selecting short-wave broadcasting\r\nas a hobby.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARCHITECTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe buildings of North Dakota cling closely to the low, tranquil\r\nlandscape of the State, avoiding exposure to the cold northwest winds\r\nthat sweep across the snowy prairie in winter. Farms and towns huddle\r\nin valleys or hug the open plain, and only grain elevators dare to\r\nbreak the comfortable horizontality of the prevailing contours. In the\r\nfew cities a tendency can be noted toward height in buildings, but the\r\nnumber of skyscrapers in North Dakota can be counted on the fingers of\r\none hand.\r\n\r\nDespite this relatively small number one skyscraper, the State Capitol\r\n(designed by Joseph B. DeRemer and William F. Kurke, and Holabird\r\nand Root, associates), has aroused more interest and comment than\r\nany other building in the history of the State. This interest has\r\nnot been confined to the borders of North Dakota, for the \"slender\r\nshaft of modernity\" which dominates the Bismarck skyline represents\r\na trend in the architecture of State capitols that is gaining the\r\nattention of the entire Nation. Because the basic reasons for the\r\nskyscraper--exaggerated land values and proximity to transportation\r\ncenters--are utterly lacking in this capacious prairie State, much\r\ncriticism has been directed at the type of statehouse chosen.\r\nNevertheless the point is made that the character and purpose of the\r\nbuilding as the seat of State government are well expressed in the\r\nimpressive height and dignity of its lines, while at the same time the\r\nstructure is decidedly utilitarian. (_See_ BISMARCK.)\r\n\r\nUtilitarianism characterized the architecture of this region before\r\neven the earliest white explorations took place. When Verendrye\r\nvisited the Mandan Indians along the Missouri in 1738 he found them\r\nliving in well-built lodges made of earth packed over a framework of\r\nlogs, comfortably cool in summer and warm in winter. The lodge was\r\nconstructed of native materials and suited the settled agricultural\r\nlife of the Mandans. In the same way the easily moved skin tipi of\r\nthe nomadic Sioux whom the early explorers found to the east of the\r\nMissouri was well suited to their wandering mode of life.\r\n\r\nThe fur traders were the first white people to build in this region,\r\nand, like the Indians, they made use of native materials. Their posts,\r\nusually on the rivers where timber was available, were rough affairs of\r\nuntrimmed logs, roofed with dirt laid over a timber framework, with\r\nthe earth for a floor. Like the Indians of the Missouri Valley, the\r\ntraders put up log stockades around their posts to ward off attacks of\r\nhostile natives.\r\n\r\nThe settlers who followed the traders into this country also made use\r\nof the trees which grew along the streams, but as settlement began\r\nto penetrate the unforested interior of the State the earth itself\r\nprovided building material for frontier homes. A furrow some three\r\ninches deep was plowed into a tough sod containing many grass roots,\r\nand the broken sod was cut into lengths the width of the wall, up to\r\ntwo and a half feet. One row of blocks was laid lengthwise of the\r\nwall and the next crosswise, with the joints staggered as in laying\r\nbricks. The finished wall provided a strong, thick barrier against\r\nsummer heat and winter cold. The roof, like that of many log houses,\r\nwas of poles covered with brush, often finished with overlapping strips\r\nof sod. Sometimes these sod roofs actually bloomed in the spring as\r\ntheir many roots came to life, and one pioneer told of the small poles\r\nwhich formed the framework of his roof leafing out inside the house in\r\nmidwinter.\r\n\r\nImproved transportation brought lumber into North Dakota, and frame\r\nshanties and houses were built. The red barn took a prominent place\r\non the farm, and the silo, for storing fodder, reared its vertical\r\nmass, sometimes dwarfing even the windmill its revolving silvery fins.\r\nExcept for the more affluent farms, where the homes sometimes boasted\r\nas many as 12 rooms and a porch, the farmhouses followed an uninspired\r\ncycle of rectangular or L-shaped frame structures, often with a lean-to\r\nshed at the back for storing wood or coal. On Russo-German farms in\r\nthe southern and western parts of the State a European love of color\r\nasserted itself as houses were painted sky blue or nile green or pink,\r\nand color combinations such as red, white, and blue formed a pattern of\r\ndiagonal stripes on the barn or granary door.\r\n\r\nIn each township appeared the one-room country school, usually white or\r\nlight green in color, with its three windows on each side, coal shed\r\nand door in one end, chimney and black board in the other, and possibly\r\na bell tower over the door. The early school was not only a seat of\r\nlearning, it was also the community center, where a Saturday night\r\nbasket social might be followed by church services the next morning.\r\n\r\nAs the stories of rich land and the lure of the frontier brought more\r\npeople to this region, small towns grew up on the prairie, most of\r\nthem consisting of one business street and a few residential streets.\r\nAlong the wooden sidewalks of Main Street the false-front building\r\npredominated, its frame facade rising a half story or more above its\r\nroof. The motive for constructing the false-front building may have\r\nbeen to provide space for a sign, or it may have been merely to \"put on\r\nfront\" literally as well as figuratively. Often the sole brick building\r\nin the young North Dakota town housed the bank, and the hotel could be\r\neasily identified by its porches. Near the railroad track was the long\r\ngable roof depot of dark red, dark green, or yellow trimmed in red. The\r\nschool was a boxlike white frame structure topped with a bell tower,\r\nand every town had at least one rectangular, white, gable roof church\r\nwith windows in either side and a steeple and bell on the entrance\r\nfacade. Residences varied from tar-paper shanties to the ornate,\r\ngabled, towered mansion of the eighties.\r\n\r\nDominating the silhouette of these little villages were the grain\r\nelevators, those bright sentinels which symbolized the reason for the\r\ntowns' founding, and still remain the most typical buildings in the\r\nNorth Dakota picture today. Like tall men standing head and shoulders\r\nabove a crowd, they rise 60 to 70 feet above the low prairie. First\r\nglimpsed as any town comes into sight is the row of wedge-shaped\r\ncupolas, like arrowheads in profile, topping the almost square red,\r\ngreen, or maroon shafts. On the side opposite the railroad track,\r\nalong which the elevators are lined, each building has its one-story\r\nscalehouse, where the trucks and wagons dump their loads of grain. A\r\nfew feet from the scalehouse is the small rectangular power house and\r\noffice building.\r\n\r\nAs towns have prospered, brick buildings have come into use in the\r\nbusiness sections, and new homes of bungalow, Colonial, old English,\r\nSpanish, and other modified styles have been built. Leaving behind the\r\nera of metal fronts, towers, and domes, public buildings are emerging\r\nin neoclassic, Gothic, Colonial, and modern architecture. The little\r\nwhite churches have given way in many instances to stone and brick\r\nstructures varying in design from Gothic to modern, the United Lutheran\r\nChurch in Grand Forks being an example of the latter. The schools have\r\nshown perhaps the greatest development of any type of building, and\r\nmost towns now have well-designed modern schools which often serve as\r\ncommunity centers.\r\n\r\nNative building materials are becoming more popular in North Dakota,\r\nand each year an increasing amount of construction utilizes native-made\r\nbrick and locally quarried sandstone. An interesting development in\r\nthe use of native materials is the rammed-earth building, the walls\r\nof which consist of earth tamped until it is hard as rock. A house\r\nand garage of this construction erected on the Scoria Lily ranch near\r\nHettinger (_see Tour 9_), because of their unusually low building\r\ncost, have attracted wide attention. The use of native boulders as a\r\nbuilding material is well illustrated in the Cairn, home of Mr. and\r\nMrs. Clell G. Gannon in Bismarck.\r\n\r\nEven with these attempts there is no native North Dakota architecture.\r\nThe schools, farms, grain elevators, and false-front business buildings\r\nare common to the entire Midwest. Many of these, although old, do not\r\nmellow, but have an air of impermanence, as though intended to serve\r\nonly until something better came along. A few houses, on the other\r\nhand, follow the good, substantial precedent of the older Eastern homes\r\nof the country. New buildings which go up represent a variety of forms,\r\na constant flux in ideas.\r\n\r\nAs evinced by buildings ranging from statehouse to filling stations,\r\nNorth Dakota is architecturally in an irresolute frame of mind,\r\nstriving, willing to try anything suggested, yet unable, to date, to\r\nevolve from these many trials a distinctive architectural contribution\r\nof its own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECREATION\r\n\r\n\r\nNorth Dakota offers many diverse forms of recreation among scenes\r\nvarying from the spectacle of the fantastically carved Badlands to the\r\nsevere beauty of the far reaching prairies. The Badlands are probably\r\nthe best known recreation area of the State. Here the two Roosevelt\r\nRegional State Parks have been set aside, and many miles of bridle\r\npaths and automobile roads are being built. The strangely colored\r\nbuttes form one of the most unusual scenic and geologic areas in the\r\nUnited States, and contain endless treasures of petrified wood and\r\nfossils of prehistoric plant and animal life.\r\n\r\nMore conventional is the beauty of the wooded Turtle Mountains, where\r\nmany attractive lakes provide swimming, fishing, and boating. In the\r\nwoods are countless varieties of wild flowers, and many species of song\r\nbirds. Of the many lakes in the Turtle Mountains, the largest and best\r\nknown are Metigoshe in the northwest part of the hills and Upsilon in\r\nthe east. Here well-equipped resorts have been established for the\r\naccommodation of summer visitors.\r\n\r\nLakes are scattered through the region south of the Turtle Mountains,\r\nand provide the main source of summer recreation in that area. Devils\r\nLake, formerly the principal resort in the State, still attracts\r\nmany visitors each year; and other lakes, especially Spiritwood near\r\nJamestown, are becoming popular. Some North Dakota lakes offer good\r\nfishing, being stocked with pike, crappies, sunfish, black bass, and\r\nrock bass. The rivers also yield pike, perch, and sunfish, as well as\r\ncatfish and pickerel.\r\n\r\nFor the Indians who once inhabited this region, hunting the buffalo was\r\nan activity in which the entire community participated. The buffalo\r\nhad almost disappeared when a young man named Theodore Roosevelt came\r\nto Dakota from the East to regain his health; but big game was still\r\nplentiful, for his books tell of hunting not only bison, but also\r\ndeer, mountain sheep, elk, antelope, wolf, coyote, and grizzly bear.\r\nDespite the vanishing of the big game, North Dakota still has excellent\r\nhunting. In the wooded areas of the Missouri and Mouse River valleys\r\nand among the Turtle and Pembina Mountains, deer may be hunted during\r\nopen seasons. Coyotes are present, as the long dreary wail heard on the\r\nwestern prairies on a still night testifies; an interesting sport is\r\nshooting them from airplanes. Many such small animals as the prairie\r\ndog, gopher, squirrel, and rabbit provide popular sport; and the alert\r\nhunter may even bag a red fox, for these crafty animals can still be\r\nfound in the broken country where there is cover.\r\n\r\nBecause migratory flocks pass over the State flying south in the\r\nfall, and because the many sloughs, swamps, and shallow lakes form\r\nideal breeding and feeding places, North Dakota has an abundance\r\nof game birds. Duck hunting is particularly good in the north and\r\ncentral regions; the southeast section of the State is best for\r\npheasant hunting; and prairie chicken and grouse are also plentiful\r\nthroughout the State. Sportsmen's clubs have taken an active part in\r\nthe protection of game birds, providing food for them in winter and\r\nsponsoring projects to give them more adequate shelter. Through the\r\nefforts of these clubs, several artificial lakes have been created: a\r\ntypical project is Lake Ardoch, where melted winter snows are impounded\r\nto form a home for migratory waterfowl.\r\n\r\nThe climate of North Dakota is conducive to winter sports. Skating,\r\nsleighing, and tobogganing have always been popular, and in recent\r\nyears many fine ski slides have been built and tournaments held\r\nannually. Hockey and curling have many followers. Figure skating,\r\nformerly regarded as a professional achievement, has also become\r\npopular, and many clubs have been formed. The frozen rivers and\r\nsnow-covered fields are excellent for ski and snowshoe hikes. In\r\nthe larger cities gala winter-sports carnivals of competitive and\r\nexhibition events are held each year, with entries from this State,\r\nMinnesota, and Canada; they are particularly interesting because of\r\ntheir international character. Snow modeling is one of the recent items\r\nadded to the list of contests, and the varicolored snow statues add a\r\nfestive appearance to the parks in which the carnivals are held.\r\n\r\nHiking is a favorite sport the year round, and is the only way many\r\ninteresting but otherwise inaccessible spots in the Badlands, the\r\nTurtle and Killdeer Mountains, and in the many State parks can be\r\nreached.\r\n\r\nOn the Indian reservations, glimpses are afforded of a people who,\r\ndespite a certain degree of assimilation, remain apart from the white\r\ncivilization that has surrounded them. Special dances are performed on\r\nceremonial occasions and at fairs. The tribal costumes are retained to\r\nsome extent, particularly among the older people; many of the ancient\r\nmethods of cooking, weaving, beadwork, and basketry can be seen, and\r\narticles of handicraft purchased.\r\n\r\nNorth Dakota is rich in remains of early Indian life. Mounds and\r\nvillage and camp sites yield arrowheads, stone implements, enigmatic\r\npetroglyphs, beads, and pottery. Old trails of early white explorers,\r\nsoldiers, and home seekers can still be traced in many places, despite\r\nthe fact that large areas have been plowed up.\r\n\r\nOf the numerous fairs and agricultural exhibits held throughout the\r\nState, probably the most interesting to the tourist are those in the\r\nwestern counties, where rodeos are usually a part of the program. The\r\nrodeo (pronounced ro´-deo in North Dakota) customarily is held in a\r\nlarge arena surrounded by a stout fence. The most dangerous sports are\r\nriding the \"bucking broncs\" and \"bulldogging\"; in the latter, the rider\r\nthrows himself from his horse to the neck of a running steer, grasps\r\nits horns and twists its head in an effort to stop the animal and\r\nthrow it to the ground, all in the shortest possible length of time.\r\nOther events often included are roping running calves; Roman races,\r\nin which the contestant stands on the saddles of two horses running\r\ndouble with their bits tied together; and wild-cow milking contests, in\r\nwhich one contestant must draw a half cup of milk from a wild cow while\r\nhis partner holds the animal. Typical rodeos are held each year in\r\nconnection with the fairs at Elbowoods and Fort Yates, where interest\r\nis increased by the large number of Indians who participate in the\r\ncontests.\r\n\r\nSpectator sports are to be found in almost every town, and include\r\nbaseball, diamond or soft ball, basketball, football, golf, tennis,\r\ntrack events, boxing tournaments, and horseshoe pitching.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEN.

Ever since it won\r\nthat honor in Territorial days, its chief claim to fame and most\r\nprized possession has been the capitol, which is an integral part of\r\nBismarck, influencing its development and character more than any other\r\nsingle feature. From the very first the capital city showed signs of\r\nenterprise that has characterized its growth. Its name was selected\r\nwith a view to flattering Germany's Iron Chancellor in the hope of\r\nbringing German capital to the rescue of the financially stricken\r\nNorthern Pacific Railway.\r\n\r\n[Map: CITY OF BISMARCK]\r\n\r\nBismarck is in the south-central portion of the State where the\r\nNorthern Pacific Railway and US 10 cross the Missouri River. The\r\nnatural ford here was long known to Indians and buffalo as one of the\r\nnarrowest and least dangerous crossings on the Missouri. A \"pay roll\"\r\ntown because of the State and Federal offices, it is a growing city\r\ndespite post-boom years; 87 new homes were built during 1936. Modern\r\nbusiness buildings constitute the downtown area, and comfortable, new,\r\nbungalow-type homes, clean streets, and well-kept lawns can be seen on\r\nthe hills which not long ago were the home of Indian tribes.\r\n\r\nThe generous western spirit of the residents seems reflected in the\r\nstructure of the city. Nothing is crowded. On the east bank of the\r\nrestless Missouri River the site of the city is hilly, rising to the\r\nnorth. Gullies and small hills in the residential district have been\r\nfilled in and smoothed off as the city has grown. Along the Missouri\r\nnear the city cretaceous rocks are exposed. Strata of shale reaching up\r\nalmost to the summit of the bank are topped with a thin layer of drift.\r\nButte-like hills can be seen in the distance north and east of the\r\ncity, their flat tops capped with Fox Hills sandstone.\r\n\r\nIn Bismarck are the headquarters of both of the old-line political\r\nparties and the various progressive groups. Hotels are the unofficial\r\nheadquarters of different parties, especially when the legislature is\r\nin session. At such times, although the city is businesslike on the\r\nsurface, there is an air of expectancy as it awaits new developments in\r\nthe State's changing political creeds.\r\n\r\nPioneers of the city can still remember the first legislative session\r\nin 1889, when the lobbyists for the Louisiana Lottery poured their\r\nmoney into legislators' pockets, and were shadowed and exposed by\r\nprivate detectives hired by a Governor and his friends. Nor forgotten\r\nare the machinations of Alexander McKenzie, who represented the\r\nrailroad interests in all things political, and who in later years\r\nexercised his peculiar talents in Alaska to such an extent that Rex\r\nBeach accorded him the role of villain in his novel _The Spoilers_\r\n(_see below_). And even the young citizens recall how four governors\r\nsucceeded one another in the teakwood gubernatorial office in the\r\ncourse of a little more than six months.\r\n\r\nLong before the arrival of the white man, the Mandan Indians found the\r\nBismarck-Mandan area a favorable spot for their homes. Their culture\r\ngives this vicinity an interesting archeological background (_see_\r\nINDIANS AND THEIR PREDECESSORS). Several village sites of the Mandans\r\nand Hidatsa are in this vicinity, and a full-sized model of an earth\r\nlodge is constructed on the Capitol grounds. Artifacts, including\r\nimplements of warfare and agriculture, pottery, and beads, were\r\nrecovered in these sites and are preserved in the museum of the State\r\nhistorical society.\r\n\r\nFrench fur traders, Lewis and Clark, Prince Paul of Wurttemberg,\r\nMaximilian, Prince of Wied, and many another early adventurer and\r\nexplorer passed the site of Bismarck in voyages up the Missouri, but\r\nsquatters, anticipating the westward path of the Northern Pacific\r\nRailway, were the first to settle this vicinity, in the winter of\r\n1871-72. During construction of the railroad a settlement called\r\nBurleightown, named for Dr. Walter Burleigh of the Northern Pacific\r\nCompany, grew up near where Fort Lincoln stands. At the end of the\r\nrailroad grade on the bank of the Missouri, just opposite Fort McKeen,\r\nwas a tent-town called Carleton City, later called Point Pleasant, and\r\nknown to the soldiers of the fort as Whiskey Point.\r\n\r\nThe site of the city was originally occupied by Camp Greeley, later\r\nknown as Camp Hancock, a military post established in 1872 for the\r\nprotection of railroad crews. One of the log buildings of the post is\r\nincorporated into the United States Weather Bureau at 101 Main Avenue,\r\nthe original post site, and is the oldest building in Bismarck.\r\n\r\nIn 1860 river transportation had begun on the upper Missouri, opening\r\na vast new region to settlement. During this period at least fifty\r\ncargoes were being discharged yearly at Fort Benton in Montana, while\r\nit required a fleet of some thirty or more vessels to transport troops\r\nand carry supplies to the various posts, forts, and Indian agencies in\r\nthe Missouri basin. The \"Crossing on the Missouri\" became a stirring\r\nsteamboat port, attracting many rivermen and wood choppers. The latter\r\nserved an industry of extensive proportions, since wood supplied all\r\nfuel needs for boats on the river and for the military posts and\r\nagencies.\r\n\r\nThe flooding of the flats near Burleightown each spring threatened\r\ndanger for the railroad grade, however, and this is thought to have\r\nbeen the ostensible reason for changing the route in 1873; actually,\r\nthe change was probably made to keep land grabbers from obtaining\r\ncontrol of the point at which the road would cross the river. A new\r\ngrade was built about one mile north, running past Camp Greeley. The\r\nLake Superior and Puget Sound Company, a town site location company\r\nauxiliary to the Northern Pacific, was then able to locate another city\r\nsite which was named Edwinton for Edwin F. Johnson, Northern Pacific\r\nchief engineer, but was generally known as \"The Crossing.\" When the\r\nBurleightown grade was left unused the town was abandoned and the\r\ninhabitants moved to Edwinton. In 1873 the name Bismarck was chosen,\r\nbut the first title of the town persisted. When Mrs. Linda Slaughter\r\nbecame postmistress in 1874 she found it necessary to point out to\r\nthe Post Office Department in Washington that mail should be addressed\r\nto \"Bismarck, D. T.\" rather than to \"The Crossing, Northern Pacific\r\nRailroad on the Missouri River, D. T.\"\r\n\r\nRails were laid into Bismarck on June 4, 1873, and it remained the\r\nterminus of the Northern Pacific until 1879. With the coming of the\r\nrailroad the town became the head of navigation on the Missouri. When\r\nriver traffic closed in the fall because of low water, no attempt was\r\nmade to operate the Northern Pacific west of Fargo until the following\r\nspring, as the company did not have snow-fighting equipment with which\r\nto keep the road open during the winter months. Merchants had to stock\r\nup in the fall with enough goods to last until spring. Mail came once\r\na week via a Government carrier from Fargo to Fort Abraham Lincoln.\r\nEnterprising persons sometimes came from Minnesota with loads of\r\ndressed poultry and hogs for Thanksgiving and Christmas. The trip from\r\nFargo to Bismarck took about six days by wagon.\r\n\r\nIn early days the young town combined the advantages of a river\r\nsteamboat port and a western railway terminus. A frontier town, the\r\nlife of its residents was necessarily rugged. A story is told of the\r\nyoung son of a newspaper editor, who questioned a stranger about his\r\nfamily and learned that the father of the visiting gentleman had died.\r\nThe youngster, familiar with the columns of his own father's paper,\r\nsaid, \"Got shot, did he?\" The stranger replied that he had not. \"Drank\r\ntoo much whiskey?\" Again the visitor replied in the negative. \"Well, he\r\ncan't be dead then,\" the boy triumphantly exclaimed, \"'cause that's the\r\nonly way men die in Bismarck!\" There were always the few, however, who\r\nmade an effort to preserve the social graces. At the first party given\r\nin Bismarck, honoring Dr. and Mrs. Slaughter on their fourth wedding\r\nanniversary, dancing was part of the entertainment, and the evening\r\nended with refreshments of champagne and buffalo tongue sandwiches.\r\n\r\nThe first train arrived in Bismarck June 5, 1873. Part of its cargo\r\nconsisted of printing presses for the Bismarck _Tribune_, which was\r\nfirst issued July 11, 1873, and continues publication as North Dakota's\r\noldest newspaper. The _Tribune's_ greatest scoop was scored in 1876\r\nwhen it gave the world the story of the Custer massacre at the Little\r\nBig Horn in Montana. Mark Kellogg, reporter for the _Tribune_ and New\r\nYork _Herald_, was killed in the battle, but more than a column of\r\nnotes on the battle was found in a buckskin pouch on his body. When\r\nGrant Marsh's steamer _Far West_ brought Reno's wounded and the first\r\nnews of the disaster, Col. C. A. Lounsberry, founder-editor of the\r\n_Tribune_, obtained the story, wiring it to the _Herald_ at a reputed\r\ncost of $3,000 for 24 hours use of the telegraph wires.\r\n\r\nBismarck felt the loss of Custer's command keenly, for he and his\r\nSeventh Cavalry officers from Fort Abraham Lincoln had figured\r\nprominently in the social life of the city.\r\n\r\nThe Bismarck _Sun_, another early newspaper, had a prominent part\r\nin the exposure of Indian and military post corruption which led\r\nto the impeachment of Secretary of War William W. Belknap in 1876.\r\nJames A. Emmons, publisher of the paper, issued a handbill entitled\r\n_Pirates of the Missouri_ which alleged that appointments as traders\r\nat military and Indian posts were being bought from the Secretary\r\nof War. The New York _Herald_ sent out a reporter, who obtained a\r\nposition at Fort Berthold Indian Agency, incognito, and succeeded in\r\nexposing the dishonesty prevalent at almost all of the Missouri River\r\nposts. The reporter barely escaped with his life when his identity was\r\ndiscovered; but he returned the next year and succeeded in completing\r\nhis investigation. Belknap was impeached on a charge of bribery, and\r\nresigned, but was later acquitted. The episode caused a great furore\r\nthroughout the country, but particularly in Bismarck.\r\n\r\nGold was discovered in the Black Hills in 1874, and Bismarck\r\nexperienced its first boom. A regular stagecoach and freight line was\r\nmaintained to Deadwood, S. Dak. It was more than 200 air line miles\r\ncross country, with no towns between. Stations were established every\r\n20 miles and all freight was hauled into the Black Hills by wagon,\r\n10 or 12 yoke of \"wild Montana cattle\" being used to pull trains of\r\ntwo or three wagonloads of freight. Gold seekers flocked to Bismarck,\r\nwhere they outfitted their supply trains before departing for the gold\r\nfields. The Bismarck _Tribune_ of October 25, 1879, reported:\r\n\r\n  \"There are no rooms available at the hotels in Bismarck tonight as\r\n  there are many transients in town bound for the Hills. Our freight\r\n  and passenger business to the gold fields has been very heavy\r\n  during the past ten days, amounting to 300,000 pounds of freight\r\n  and seventy passengers. There were also two carloads of horses\r\n  shipped in for the stage coaches. There are at present two and\r\n  sometimes three stages a day.\"\r\n\r\nGold dust and nuggets brought $20 an ounce in trade in Bismarck. Many\r\nwho came to join in the gold rush stayed to take advantage of the\r\nbusiness opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe year 1881 saw a serious flood of the Missouri River. Most Bismarck\r\nresidents, with their homes up on the hills out of the river's reach,\r\nmade light of the occasion, some even to the extent of an excursion.\r\nCapt. William Braithwaite ran his steamer _Eclipse_ to the foot of\r\nThird Street where passengers boarded for a trip to nearby Mandan,\r\nthe greater part of which, like the five miles of river bottom land\r\nbetween the two towns, was under water. It is reported that everyone\r\non the boat \"danced and had a good time.\" Not so pleasant, however,\r\nwere the experiences of those who lived in the lowlands. The flood\r\ncame upon them suddenly, drowning their horses and cattle, inundating\r\ntheir homes, and forcing many to climb trees. Perched above the\r\nmuddy, swirling waters and floating cakes of ice, several of these\r\nunfortunates froze their hands and feet or otherwise suffered from\r\nexposure. Wildlife also suffered because of the flood, and deer and\r\nother game could be seen floating down the river on cakes of ice.\r\n\r\nThe Northern Pacific railroad bridge across the Missouri was completed\r\nin 1882. Previous to this time the trains had crossed the river on\r\nbarges in the summer and on tracks laid on the ice in winter.\r\n\r\nWhen the Territorial capital was removed from Yankton, S. Dak., to\r\nBismarck in 1883 the city experienced a second boom. Land prices\r\nskyrocketed, and blocks of lots often changed hands several times\r\nin an incredibly short period, since it was fondly, if erroneously,\r\nanticipated that Bismarck would have a phenomenal growth and would soon\r\noutrank many well-established and populous cities. The cornerstone\r\nof the capitol building was laid that year at an elaborate ceremony\r\nattended by members of the Golden Spike Excursion who were on their\r\nway west to celebrate the completion of the Northern Pacific Railway.\r\nHeaded by ex-President Grant and Henry Villard, president of the\r\nNorthern Pacific, there was present a galaxy of prominent Americans\r\nincluding Sitting Bull and numerous foreign dignitaries and noblemen.\r\nThese notable guests spent some time in Bismarck and every effort was\r\nexerted to make their stay eventful. One young woman went so far as\r\nto painstakingly decorate her apple tree with three bushels of apples\r\npurchased at a local grocery store. Showing it to her admiring guests\r\nthe next day she asked, \"What do you think of this for a fruit-growing\r\ncountry?\" \"Magnificent, magnificent!\" Grant replied, \"I am surprised,\r\nwonderfully surprised!\" So were townsmen standing nearby, but they held\r\ntheir tongues.\r\n\r\nSince these early booms the growth of the city has not been remarkable,\r\nbut it has been steady. A large factor in the prosperity of Bismarck\r\nhas been the numerous Federal and State institutions and offices.\r\n\r\nBismarck's first church service was held on June 15, 1873, although\r\nMrs. Linda W. Slaughter organized a Sunday school in a Camp Hancock\r\ntent as early as August of the previous year. The first church in the\r\ncity was the Presbyterian, at 303 Second Street. When the Catholic\r\nchurch was built in 1898 the Marquise de Mores gave a large stained\r\nglass window in honor of her late husband. The window, portraying the\r\nImmaculate Conception, bears his name and is in the front of the church\r\nin the choir loft. Fourteen religious denominations are represented in\r\nBismarck.\r\n\r\nTwo hospitals and several clinics serve both the urban population and\r\na large rural area. Radio station KFYR, with studios at 200 Fourth\r\nStreet, is an associate member of the National Broadcasting Company\r\nand operates on 5,000-watt power during the day and 1,000 at night.\r\nFour newspapers in addition to the _Tribune_ are published in Bismarck:\r\nTwo semi-weeklies, the Bismarck _Capital_ and _Der Staats Anzeiger_\r\n(German); and two weeklies, the _Leader_, organ of the Nonpartisan\r\nLeague, and the Dakota _Freie Presse_ (German). Bismarck and its\r\nsurrounding territory have a large German and Russo-German population.\r\n\r\nThe city was the home of James W. Foley, North Dakota poet, during his\r\nschool days, and later he was a member of the Bismarck _Tribune_ staff.\r\nHis numerous books include _Prairie Breezes_ and _Voices of Song_.\r\n\r\nAlthough Bismarck is in the heart of the spring wheat region, where\r\nfour times more acres are planted in wheat than any other crop, the\r\ncity's industrial life is subordinate to its political. Commercially it\r\nis a wholesale distributing point for many State or district offices\r\nof various lines of merchandise. In addition there are flour mills,\r\ncreameries, grain elevators, and seed-houses. A pioneer seed-house and\r\nnursery, the Oscar H. Will Company, founded in Bismarck in 1881, is the\r\nlargest concern of its kind in the State. Specializing in seed corn, in\r\nwhich it followed the example of the agricultural Mandan Indians, the\r\ncompany has propagated many new, and acclimated several established,\r\nvarieties of plants, grain, and nursery stock that are exceptionally\r\nhardy, drought resisting, and quick maturing. North of Bismarck are\r\nextensive lignite coal deposits, with one of the largest strip mines in\r\nthe State in north Burleigh County, near Wilton.\r\n\r\nIn 1903 several thousand farmers of German extraction migrated from\r\nWisconsin to settle the farm lands in the Bismarck territory. They have\r\nmade the city a shipping point for a constantly increasing dairy, wool,\r\nhoney, and corn output. The drought conditions of the 1930's have cut\r\ninto agricultural production, but have intensified recognition of the\r\nneed for diversified farming, which is more widely practiced each year.\r\n\r\nOne of the most notable events of recent years was the burning of\r\nthe old capitol in December 1930. The year following there was talk\r\nof capital removal, the most serious contender being the city of\r\nJamestown, 100 miles to the east. In the election of 1932, however,\r\npopular vote decided in favor of retaining the site at Bismarck, and\r\non October 8 that year Vice President Charles M. Curtis laid the\r\ncornerstone of the new statehouse.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS OF INTEREST\r\n\r\n1. The 19 stories of the STATE CAPITOL (_open weekdays 9-5; guide_),\r\nN. end of 6th St., high on Capitol Hill, overlook the city and the\r\nbroad Missouri valley. The white shaft is an impressive sight even to\r\nthose who quarrel with the idea of a skyscraper capitol for a prairie\r\nState. Designed in 1932 by two North Dakota architects, Joseph Bell\r\nde Remer of Grand Forks and William F. Kurke of Fargo, with Holabird\r\nand Root of Chicago as associates, its clean hard modern lines are\r\nexponent of the fact that, as the architect F. A. Gutheim has said,\r\n\"Domed pseudo-Renaissance state capitols are sinking low on the Western\r\nhorizon.\" North Dakota has followed the example of Nebraska and\r\nLouisiana in building what may be a forerunner of a new and distinctive\r\nstyle of State capitols.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of architectural developments from this building does\r\nnot, however, deter critics who find it difficult to reconcile the\r\nskyscraper with the prairies. The customary objection is that those\r\nconditions which are the _raison d'etre_ of the skyscraper--high land\r\nvalues and congestion at transportation centers--are decidedly absent\r\nin Bismarck. The justification of the building, therefore, must lie in\r\nits expression of the dignity and power of the State government.\r\n\r\nDespite criticism, the Capitol has its defenders, who feel the strength\r\nand height of the structure to be expressive of its intent. And no\r\nmatter what the decision may be on the architectural problem, the\r\nbuilding at any rate fulfills its utilitarian function: it is one\r\nof the most efficiently built government buildings in the country.\r\nIt provides space for approximately one thousand State and Federal\r\nemployees. The asymmetrical tower arrangement allows complete\r\nseparation of the executive and legislative branches of the State, and\r\ndespite differences of opinion as to the exterior of the building,\r\nopinion is general that the interior is both remarkable and beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe building houses State administrative offices in the tower and the\r\nState legislature in the circular three-story wing. The two sections\r\nof the structure are joined by Memorial Hall. The outer walls of\r\nthe entire building are faced with Bedford limestone, and the base\r\nis trimmed with a broad ribbon of Rosetta black granite (gabbro), a\r\nrelatively rare stone of volcanic origin.\r\n\r\nA sweeping flight of steps leads to the plaza, above which rise the\r\nhuge bronze-framed windows of Memorial Hall, topped with symbolic\r\nbronze figures representing the Indian, Hunter, Trapper, Farmer, Miner,\r\nand the Mothers of the State. These figures, as well as others in the\r\ninterior of the building, are the work of Edgar Miller of Chicago.\r\n\r\nThe building can be entered from the plaza or on the ground floor\r\nthrough the porte-cochère. The ground floor corridor is wainscoted in\r\nrosy-tan Montana travertine. In the lobby is the custodian's desk where\r\nvisitors register. From this point tours of the building leave hourly.\r\nTo the right is the elevator lobby, where the sliding bronze elevator\r\ndoors depict the Indian, the Hunter, the Cowhand, and other figures\r\nsymbolic of the development of the State. At the end of the elevator\r\nlobby is the capitol café.\r\n\r\nSteps ascending from the ground floor in a stairwell of highly polished\r\nblack Belgian marble lead directly into Memorial Hall, which, although\r\n342 ft. long, 25 ft. wide, and 42 ft. high, appears even more spacious\r\nwith its 10 tall fluted bronze columns lining either side and catching\r\nthe sunlight which floods through the tall windows of the facade. The\r\nwalls are of polished Montana travertine and the floors of gray-white\r\nTennessee marble. From the windows in the facade there is a beautiful\r\nview of the city, the winding Missouri, and the hazy blue bluffs beyond.\r\n\r\nThe legislative foyer, a continuation of Memorial Hall into the\r\nthree-story wing, is paneled in rosewood and curly maple. Inlaid\r\ncanopies project over upholstered wall seats. Both the House of\r\nRepresentatives (L) and the Senate Chamber (R) are semicircular\r\nin design. Paneling of matched chestnut adorns the walls of the\r\nHouse, and the floor and ceiling are blue. An indirect lighting and\r\nventilation system is concealed in the coves of the ceiling. The Senate\r\nChamber, somewhat smaller than the House, has been judged one of the\r\nmost beautiful rooms in the United States. It is paneled in a rich\r\nbrown English oak with bronze cross stripes covering the joinings.\r\nThe ceiling and floor are brown and the chairs are upholstered in\r\ncream-colored leather.\r\n\r\nAt the end of Memorial Hall opposite the legislative foyer are the\r\noffices of the governor, attorney general, and secretary of state. In\r\nthe governor's suite the reception room is paneled in laurelwood, the\r\nprivate office of the governor in teakwood, the corridor in prima vera,\r\nand the conference room in mahogany.\r\n\r\nThe second floor of the tower is occupied by the supreme court. The\r\ndignified courtroom is paneled in rosewood, the judges' conference room\r\nis finished in walnut, and Honduras mahogany is used in the office of\r\nthe chief justice. The supreme court law library of 50,000 volumes\r\noccupies two large rooms. A fine view of Memorial Hall can be obtained\r\nfrom the supreme court elevator lobby, which faces directly on the hall.\r\n\r\nAbove the second floor of the tower are other State offices. The\r\neighteenth floor is designed as an observation tower, which affords a\r\npanoramic view of the entire Bismarck-Mandan vicinity, taking in Fort\r\nAbraham Lincoln State Park, Fort Lincoln, the State Penitentiary, the\r\ncurving river with its wooded lowlands, the gray-blue bluffs beyond,\r\nand, all around, the rolling prairie.\r\n\r\n2. LIBERTY MEMORIAL BUILDING (_open weekdays 9-5_), SE. of the\r\nCapitol, a memorial to World War dead, designed in 1921 by Keith and\r\nKurke of Fargo, houses the North Dakota State Library Commission,\r\nState Historical Society of North Dakota, and its museum and library.\r\nA four-story structure of Classic design, with a base of Minnesota\r\ngranite and walls of Bedford limestone, its Ionic columns rise\r\ngracefully above the grass-covered terrace.\r\n\r\nThe massive bronze doors of the west facade lead into a corridor\r\npaneled in Italian travertine with a trim of Kasota stone. The graceful\r\ndouble stairway which rises across the corridor has marble balustrades\r\nand travertine newel posts.\r\n\r\nLeft of the stairway is the historical society library exhibit room,\r\nand right is the State library commission which has general supervision\r\nof all public libraries in the State.\r\n\r\nOn the ground floor are the main offices of the State historical\r\nsociety library. The offices of the historical society are on the\r\nsecond floor. This society was founded in 1887, became a State\r\ndepartment in 1905, and in addition to its work in collecting and\r\npreserving historical material has been especially active in building\r\nup the 46 State parks and historical sites.\r\n\r\nThe HISTORICAL SOCIETY MUSEUM, on the second and third floors of the\r\nMemorial Building, contains excellent collections of North Dakota\r\nmaterial. The Indian collection gives a complete picture of the life\r\nof the North Dakota Indian, showing examples of clothing, cooking\r\nutensils, pottery, knives, drums, saddles, war clubs, bows and arrows,\r\ncanoe, and bullboat. It also includes many archeological finds made in\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nIn the pioneer rooms are relics of early days of white settlement of\r\nthe State. A military collection shows many types of guns and cannon in\r\nuse since settlement. The natural history rooms contain fine displays\r\nof flora and fauna, fossils and minerals.\r\n\r\nAn equestrian statue of Theodore Roosevelt, the plaster model by A.\r\nPhimister Proctor for the statue in Roosevelt Park in Minot (_see_\r\nMINOT), is on the third floor, and nearby is the desk which Roosevelt\r\nused for most of his writing at his Badlands ranch. Many models of\r\nearly forts, Indian villages, and river steamboats are on display.\r\n\r\nA bronze STATUE OF SAKAKAWEA stands on the lawn between the statehouse\r\nand the Liberty Memorial Building. Sakakawea was the Shoshone Bird\r\nWoman who led the Lewis and Clark expedition through the unexplored\r\nmountainous Northwest to the Pacific Ocean. The statue, by Leonard\r\nCrunelle (1910), depicts the Indian woman with her baby strapped to her\r\nback, looking westward toward the country she helped to open.\r\n\r\nUnsung during her lifetime, Sakakawea in recent years has been\r\nrecognized as the outstanding woman in the development of the\r\nNorthwest. Carrying her new-born son, Baptiste, she joined the\r\nexpedition at the Mandan village near the present site of Stanton, N.\r\nDak. She accompanied the party with her husband, Touissant Charbonneau,\r\nwho had been engaged as an interpreter. Soon she proved to be the most\r\nvaluable member of the party. Her services were those of guide, cook,\r\nand general emissary to the Indian tribes encountered on the journey.\r\nLewis and Clark credited her with the success of their expedition.\r\n\r\nOn the return of the exploring party Sakakawea, Baptiste, and\r\nCharbonneau were left at the Mandan village where they had joined the\r\nexpedition more than a year earlier. Mystery and controversy obscure\r\nthe lives of the Indian woman and her son from this point. Sakakawea\r\nis believed by some to have died on the Shoshone Reservation at Wind\r\nRiver, Wyo., when almost 100 years of age. Others hold that she died at\r\nFort Manuel on the Grand River in South Dakota only a few years after\r\nthe return of the Lewis and Clark expedition. Painstaking investigation\r\nhas definitely proved neither theory.\r\n\r\nOf Baptiste it is known that he was educated by Capt. William Clark\r\nat St. Louis. Returning to the Northwest, he became an interpreter\r\nlike his father, and met Paul Wilhelm, Prince of Wurttemberg, who was\r\nexploring North America. With the German nobleman he went to Europe,\r\nbut on his return his path is lost to the historian. He may have been\r\nwith his mother on the Wind River Reservation--if, indeed, she died\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThe PROW OF THE BATTLESHIP _North Dakota_, mounted on a boulder of\r\nnative granite, stands N. of the Memorial Building, near the statue\r\nof Sakakawea. To the south of the building stands a large Krupp gun,\r\nassigned to the State by the Federal Government as a trophy of the\r\nWorld War. Near these guns lie specimens of Cannonball River sandstone\r\nformations.\r\n\r\n3. ROOSEVELT CABIN (_open June 15-Sept. 15, weekdays 10-5, Sun. 2-5_),\r\nE. of Memorial Building, was the home of Theodore Roosevelt from 1883\r\nto 1885, when he was a rancher in the North Dakota Badlands. Known as\r\nthe Maltese Cross because of its cattle brand, the ranch was renamed by\r\nRoosevelt for nearby Chimney Butte.\r\n\r\nThe cabin originally had a much steeper, shingle roof, but a later\r\nowner replaced this with a sod one, hoping to make the building warmer.\r\nThe interior furnishings are copies of those used by \"Teddy,\" although\r\nthe cook stove is thought to be the original. Much Rooseveltiana,\r\nincluding books and guns, is preserved in the cabin.\r\n\r\nIn 1904 the Chimney Butte cabin was purchased by the North Dakota\r\nCommission, and sent to the St. Louis World's Fair of that year, to\r\nPortland, Ore., for the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition in 1905,\r\nand then to Bismarck where it was placed on the grounds in front of the\r\nCapitol, and after a few years was moved to its present site. An iron\r\ngate, handwrought by Haile Chisholm of the North Dakota Agricultural\r\nCollege faculty, depicts the initial letters of the various fields of\r\nenterprise in which Roosevelt engaged.\r\n\r\n4. EARTH LODGE (_open weekdays 9-5 June 15-Oct. 1_), N. of the\r\nRoosevelt Cabin, is a reproduction of the dwellings of the Mandan,\r\nArikara, and Hidatsa, the agricultural tribes who inhabited the valley\r\nof the Missouri previous to white settlement of this region. (For\r\ndescription of the earth lodge see INDIANS AND THEIR PREDECESSORS.) The\r\nlodge was built by the State historical society under the direction of\r\nScattered Corn, a Mandan woman, the daughter of Moves Slowly, last of\r\nthe Mandan Corn priests.\r\n\r\nThe women of the Indian tribes built the lodges in the river villages,\r\nalthough the men gave them assistance in placing the heavy timbers\r\nwhich supported the thick earth walls. A Mandan legend relates that\r\nwhen the first Mandan village was built under the leadership of the\r\ntribal hero, Good Furred Robe, the First Man told them how to build the\r\nearth lodges.\r\n\r\n5. GOVERNOR'S MANSION (_private_), 320 Ave. B, has been the residence\r\nof North Dakota Governors since 1893, when the house was purchased\r\nby the State from Asa Fisher, wealthy brewer. Governor Eli C. D.\r\nShortridge was the first chief executive to occupy the mansion. Typical\r\nof the architecture of the Territorial day in which it was built, the\r\ntwo-story white frame building, with its spacious, high-ceilinged rooms\r\nand four fireplaces, has remained unchanged except for the addition of\r\na front porch. The large elm and box elder trees were planted in 1900.\r\nDuring early statehood many important social functions were held in the\r\nmansion.\r\n\r\n6. CAIRN (_private_), 912 Mandan St., home of Mr. and Mrs. Clell G.\r\nGannon, is a small house built largely of native boulders, and designed\r\nby its owners.\r\n\r\n7. HOME OF ALEXANDER McKENZIE (_private_), 722 5th St., a large white\r\nframe house built in the indeterminate, unpedigreed style typical of\r\nNorth Dakota's architecture of the nineties, remains unchanged from\r\nthe days when it was the home of Alexander McKenzie (1856-1922),\r\nspectacular figure of early Bismarck and State history, master\r\npolitician, ally of the railroads.\r\n\r\nArriving in Bismarck as a young man in the early 1870's, he soon\r\nrose to a position of civic and Territorial importance, becoming an\r\nunofficial representative of the Northern Pacific Railway. How much\r\nMcKenzie had to do with moving the Territorial capital from Yankton to\r\nBismarck will perhaps never be known. However, the fact that a Capital\r\nCommission was named and given power to move the capital, and the\r\nfact that McKenzie secured for himself a place on the commission, are\r\ncredited to him as among his most able political maneuvers.\r\n\r\nAlthough he held only one public office--sheriff of Burleigh County for\r\n12 years--his influence and the so-called \"McKenzie ring\" survived all\r\nattacks by political reformers. He was active in State politics until\r\nhis death in 1922.\r\n\r\n8. BURLEIGH COUNTY COURTHOUSE, Thayer Ave. between 5th and 6th Sts.,\r\nis a three-story modern-type building designed by Ira Rush of Minot\r\nand constructed of North Dakota concrete-brick faced with Bedford\r\nlimestone, with a base of pearl pink granite. In the main floor\r\nvestibule, wainscoted in marble, is a series of murals by Clell. G.\r\nGannon, Bismarck artist, depicting early county history. A further\r\nnative note appears in the balustrading of the stairways, where grilled\r\nnickel silver forms a graceful design using the stalk, ear, and slender\r\nleaf of the corn as motif.\r\n\r\nThis is the third Burleigh County courthouse to stand on this block.\r\nA marker on the west lawn designates the site of the first, a log\r\nbuilding built in 1873. It was replaced in 1880 by a brick structure.\r\nThe present building was erected in 1930.\r\n\r\n9. BISMARCK PUBLIC LIBRARY (_open weekdays 10:30-9; Oct.-May Sun.\r\n2-5_), 519 Thayer Ave., a Carnegie institution, is a vine-covered,\r\nred brick Georgian Colonial style building. In addition to having a\r\nlarge and varied selection of magazines, newspapers, and fiction and\r\nnon-fiction books, it maintains a separate children's division with\r\nloan service, reading room, and story hour.\r\n\r\n10. FEDERAL BUILDING, NE. corner Bdwy. and 3rd St., a tile-roofed\r\nIndiana limestone building of Italian design, houses the post office,\r\nUnited States courtroom, and various Federal offices.\r\n\r\n11. MARQUIS DE MORES' STORAGE PLANT, 300 Main St., is a plain, somewhat\r\nshabby building used as a restaurant, built by the marquis when he\r\nenvisaged a huge meat packing industry in the Badlands (_see Tour 8_).\r\nThe building was formerly situated south of the railroad. The walls\r\nconsist of two-inch planks laid flat on each other. These, together\r\nwith the brick veneer, form a wall about 14 inches thick.\r\n\r\n12. UNITED STATES WEATHER BUREAU (_open_), 101 Main St., was begun\r\nas part of the work of Camp Hancock in 1874, and a portion of the\r\nstructure, the old log building which was Camp Hancock headquarters,\r\nremains. It is the oldest building in Bismarck, but has been sheathed\r\nin lumber, and additions have been built. The bureau, moved 11 times,\r\nis now permanently established at its first home.\r\n\r\n13. WORLD WAR MEMORIAL BUILDING, 215 6th St., which serves as a\r\ncommunity center, is a three-story structure of modern design, built of\r\nwhite Hebron (N. Dak.) brick and concrete with limestone trim. It was\r\ndesigned by Liebenberg and Kaplan of Minneapolis in 1930.\r\n\r\n14. BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA (_open weekdays 8:30-4:30_), 700 Main St.,\r\nwas created by a special referendum election of June 26, 1919, passing\r\na law providing that \"For the purpose of encouraging and promoting\r\nagriculture, commerce and industry, the State of North Dakota shall\r\nengage in the business of banking, and for that purpose shall and\r\ndoes establish a system of banking, owned, controlled and operated by\r\nit, under the name of the Bank of North Dakota.\" It is managed and\r\ncontrolled by the State Industrial Commission. State funds, and funds\r\nof State institutions are deposited here. The bank was one of the\r\nimportant features in the program of the Nonpartisan League at the time\r\nof its organization, being designed to carry out the fourth plank of\r\nthe league platform, the establishment of rural credit banks operated\r\nat cost. The red brick bank building was originally an automobile\r\nwarehouse.\r\n\r\nSTATE REGULATORY DEPARTMENT LABORATORY (_open_), is on the fourth floor\r\nof the Bank of North Dakota Building. North Dakota was a pioneer State\r\nin pure food legislation. A law passed in 1895 paved the way for\r\nthe pure food and fertilizer laws of 1903. State inspectors, active\r\nat all times throughout the State, send samples for analysis to this\r\nlaboratory, where trained chemists make the tests. Constant inspection\r\nof food and dairy products, feeds, fertilizers, water, oils, and paints\r\nis maintained.\r\n\r\n15. ST. MARY'S CEMETERY, NE. edge of the city, contains the graves of\r\nmany of the pioneers who played an important part in the development of\r\nthe city and State. Among those buried here are Alexander McKenzie and\r\nhis son, Alexander, Jr.; and Gen. E. A. Williams, first representative\r\nfrom Burleigh County to the Territorial Assembly, and his wife.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS OF INTEREST IN ENVIRONS\r\n\r\n  State Penitentiary, =2 m.=, Fort Lincoln, =4.5 m.=, Sibley Island,\r\n  =7 m.=, Liberty Memorial Bridge, =1.5 m.= (_see Tour 8_).

A small,\r\nyouthful city, whose varied activities give its business section a\r\nsomewhat disorderly air, it is the largest town in North Dakota. Over\r\nthe flatness of an old lakebed, where ten thousand years ago the water\r\nof the melting glacier stood 200 feet deep, the city now widely spreads\r\nits homes, manufacturing plants, wholesale houses, trees and parks,\r\nschools and hospitals.\r\n\r\nThe trail which in 1871 led west from the Red River ferry, across\r\nthe level floor of prehistoric Lake Agassiz, is now Front Street,\r\nwhich enters Fargo from the east to be greeted by the city's slum\r\ndistrict, where dilapidated, unpainted frame shacks near the river\r\ngive way westward to better buildings in a wholesaling district, until\r\nBroadway is reached. Broadway is the very heart of Fargo, a busy,\r\ncrowded thoroughfare whose appearance often causes visitors to believe\r\nthe city larger than it actually is. From its wide south end where\r\nit intersects Front, Broadway runs north, flanked for six blocks by\r\ntwo-and three-story store and office buildings. Two of North Dakota's\r\nfour \"skyscrapers\" are on Broadway.\r\n\r\nFargo first appeared on the horizon in the 1870's as an outfitting\r\npoint, the last outpost of settlement for those tens of thousands\r\nwho pioneered in the State, and through the years of its growth has\r\nretained its first excuse for being, for it still serves as chief\r\ndistributing point for a large agricultural area. Farm implements,\r\nfoodstuffs, petroleum products, automobiles, and automotive equipment\r\nto the value of more than $45,000,000 are handled annually.\r\n\r\nAlthough from a North Dakota standpoint it is an old city, Fargo is\r\nyoung enough to have a few of its founders still alive to tell of how\r\nthey first advertised their spindly little city by boasting that its\r\nvolunteer fire company, the Yerxa Hose Team, was the world's fastest;\r\nor of how, in later years, Fargo gloried in being the \"Gateway City\"\r\nto the \"bread basket of the world,\" the fertile Red River Valley which\r\nreal estate agents compared to the valley of the Nile. The Valley is no\r\nlonger the intensive wheat-raising area it was, but the Fargo Chamber\r\nof Commerce will tell you that this very fertile flat land, through\r\nwhich meanders one of the few rivers that flow north, is literally\r\na land of milk and honey, and others no less cognizant of their\r\nsurroundings have changed the old slogan to the \"food basket of the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\nBecause it is the distributing point for an agricultural State, changes\r\nin farming methods have been reflected in the business life of the\r\ncity. With the introduction of diversified farming to supplement wheat\r\ngrowing, Fargo became an important shipping center for grain, potatoes,\r\ndairy, and poultry products. In 1936 it was the largest primary sweet\r\nclover market in the world. Seed companies, creameries, a flour mill,\r\nbakeries, and implement distributors are evidence of the relationship\r\nbetween the city and the large farming area it serves. As late as\r\n1927 Fargo was the world's third largest farm machinery distributing\r\npoint, and, although it undoubtedly does not retain this position,\r\nas a shipping point it has become even more significant. A change in\r\nfreight rates granted in 1925 by the Interstate Commerce Commission\r\nboosted Fargo volume. Two of the three railroads into the city are\r\ntranscontinental lines which, with their branches, cover almost the\r\nentire State of North Dakota. Several \"feeder lines\" converge at Fargo\r\nand in addition there are a large number of trucking companies. The\r\nMinneapolis _Star_ said in 1936:\r\n\r\n  \"Fargo stands in exactly the same relationship to the northwest\r\n  that Minneapolis has always stood.... The significant point is that\r\n  it is some 250 miles nearer the western point of consumption. Goods\r\n  that used to stop at Minneapolis for distribution now flow on to\r\n  Fargo to be piecemealed out.\"\r\n\r\nThe largest single part of the wholesale trade is carried on by\r\nautomotive distributors, including the Ford and Chevrolet Motor\r\nCompanies. Processing accounts for the next largest part of the city's\r\nindustry, and, although meat packing and creameries are important,\r\nthere is a constant increase in the manufacture of steel, wood, and\r\nglass products. Fargo is likewise a banking and insurance center, and\r\nhas the home offices of two insurance companies.\r\n\r\nIts situation, at the point where railroads first entered the State,\r\nin what Stuart Chase has characterized as perhaps the richest farming\r\nregion in the world, has combined with the North Dakota Agricultural\r\nCollege to make Fargo the natural agricultural headquarters for North\r\nDakota. Results of experimental work conducted at the college station\r\nand its substations, extension work through 4-H and Homemakers clubs,\r\nand judging of farm produce at State and county fairs by college\r\ninstructors, all contribute to the improvement of agricultural and\r\nrural life in the State.\r\n\r\nFargo's percentage of home ownership is far above the national average.\r\nHomes clustered around the business district are of early twentieth\r\ncentury frame vintage, while farther out newer cottages and bungalows,\r\nin English and Colonial style, behind small young trees and newly\r\nsprouting lawns, are characteristic of the more recent residential\r\nadditions. Some of Fargo's finest homes are on Eighth Street South.\r\n\r\nFargo's public school system consists of 11 elementary schools, 3\r\njunior high schools, and a senior high school; privately owned are\r\n3 Catholic schools, a Lutheran school, 3 business colleges, 2 music\r\nconservatories, and 5 trade schools. The first Protestant church\r\nservices in the southern Red River Valley in North Dakota were held in\r\nFargo, and now more than 30 denominations have churches in the city.\r\nSt. Mary's Cathedral is the seat of the diocese of the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch for the eastern half of North Dakota, and Fargo is likewise the\r\nseat of the North Dakota diocese of the Episcopal Church.\r\n\r\nThe city's best-known musical group, the Amphion Male Chorus, composed\r\nof Fargo and Moorhead, Minn., singers, has toured nearby cities and\r\neastern United States, giving concerts in New York and Philadelphia.\r\nCommunity singing is popular in Fargo, and during the summer months\r\nIsland Park is the scene of outdoor concerts and singing contests. In\r\nJune each year the music-minded of the Red River Valley gather in the\r\ncity for the Valleyland Music Festival.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural college, always prominent in the cultural life of the\r\ncity, has become even more important in late years with the increased\r\nnumber of college lyceum programs and the growth of the community\r\ntheater movement. The Little Country Theater, the outstanding players'\r\ngroup in the State, has become a virtual authority on community theater\r\norganization and has received favorable notice nationally.\r\n\r\nThe city is named for William G. Fargo, a director of the Northern\r\nPacific Railway and founder of the Wells-Fargo Express Company, and\r\nits early history is closely linked with that of the railroad. In 1871\r\nthe announcement that a railroad would be built \"from Lake Superior to\r\nthe Pacific Ocean\" aroused much speculation as to where it would cross\r\nthe Red River, and the untouched land along the river suddenly became\r\npopulated. Three settlers, Jacob Lowell, Jr., Henry S. Back, and Andrew\r\nMcHench, formed a triumvirate and patrolled the Red from the mouth of\r\nthe Wild Rice to the Elm River from April to June 29 in an effort to\r\ndiscover \"the first indications of the railroad crossing.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Thomas H. Canfield of the Lake Superior and Puget Sound\r\nCompany, a town site company auxiliary to the Northern Pacific, worked\r\nwith the railroad engineers in seeking the best point for the line to\r\ncross the Red, since he wished to secure title to the land for his\r\ncompany before it was snatched up by some speculator in the hope of\r\nselling it to the railroad for a large sum. He and his engineers chose\r\nthe present crossing because it was the highest point on the river\r\nand therefore in the least danger from floods. Andrew Holes, who with\r\nhis wife had been touring the country in a covered wagon, was sent to\r\nAlexandria, Minn., to purchase the land on the east side of the river\r\nfrom its homesteader-owner, Joab Smith. In order to locate on the lands\r\nwest of the Red it was necessary to plow a half acre of each section.\r\nAided by Maj. G. G. Beardsley, Canfield secured the necessary farm\r\nequipment, hid it until Holes returned with the deed to the Minnesota\r\nproperty, and by moonlight secretly made the required improvements.\r\n\r\nOn June 29, while on his patrol, Lowell found a \"Farmer Brown\" squatted\r\nwith three Scandinavian settlers on what became the Fargo town site.\r\nAlthough Farmer Brown was clothed in well worn overalls with a brown\r\nhat and hickory shirt and \"sat with such ease and unconcern upon the\r\nhandles of his plow,\" Lowell doubted his being a farmer. He hastily\r\nsummoned Back and McHench, and the three, after a consultation,\r\nlocated near Farmer Brown on July 1 and 2, 1871. Shortly afterwards\r\nFarmer Brown's identity as Beardsley became known and a stampede of\r\nsettlers followed. Since Beardsley and his party were in the employ\r\nof the Lake Superior and Puget Sound Company, and were not bona fide\r\nsettlers, their prior occupancy was disregarded and later, after much\r\nlitigation, the company withdrew its claim to the Fargo land, retaining\r\nonly the purchased Moorhead area.\r\n\r\nIn September 1871 G. J. Keeney was appointed postmaster of Centralia,\r\nthe little settlement that sprang up at the railroad crossing. Keeney\r\nwas also a lawyer and real estate agent and his office was somewhat of\r\na community center, according to one author, who wrote,\r\n\r\n  \"He placed over the door of his 10 × 12 office the sign 'Post\r\n  Office', on the door the sign 'Law Office', and in the window 'Land\r\n  Office.' He raised lettuce on the earth roof of his log shack, and\r\n  decorated the inside walls with papers sent by the folks back home.\r\n  On entering, one was at once impressed with the air of cleanliness\r\n  and comfort which pervaded the sanctum of this enterprising limb of\r\n  the law, and it became a popular reading and rest room, but ... one\r\n  assumed a risk in becoming interested in a story as some chapter of\r\n  it was certain to be found on the ceiling.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the winter following the location of the site, the settlement\r\ndivided into two communities. \"Fargo on the Prairie\", headquarters\r\nof the Northern Pacific engineering department (near the corner of\r\nBroadway and Front Streets), was a tent town, home of the railroad\r\nengineers and surveyors and their wives and children. Although\r\ncrude, the tents of \"Fargo on the Prairie\" had all the luxuries and\r\nconveniences that money could bring into the frontier settlement. In\r\nsharp contrast to this was \"Fargo in the Timber,\" a town of huts, rough\r\nlog houses, dugouts, and caves dug in the river banks, which stretched\r\nalong both sides of the trail leading up from the ferry crossing.\r\nThe two communities had nothing in common and residents of one would\r\nnever be mistaken for residents of the other. The Timber used great\r\nquantities of whiskey, and popping revolvers made the night dangerous.\r\nThe postmaster resorted to \"double planking\" the sleeping bunk of his\r\ntent for safety, and it was well that he did, for in later years he\r\ncould show a board of the bunk with a bullet embedded in it.\r\n\r\nA typical Timber sense of humor was displayed by the resident who, when\r\nbuying a load of wood from two young Moorhead, Minn., men, had them\r\nhaul it over to Fargo, and then drew his revolver and ordered the men\r\nback across the river without troubling to pay for the wood.\r\n\r\nThe difference between Fargo in the Timber and Fargo on the Prairie\r\nengendered a rivalry which both sides seldom neglected to intensify.\r\nOnce when a wagonload of potatoes arrived for Gen. Thomas L. Rosser\r\nof the Prairie, residents of the Timber loosened the end-gates of the\r\nwagon and shot off revolvers to frighten the horses. As the team\r\ndashed wildly up the road, the potatoes rolled out of the wagon, to\r\nbe picked up with relish by residents of the Timber, for many of whom\r\nthose were the only potatoes obtainable all that winter.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, as a sleigh-load of dressed turkeys and chickens\r\nbound for military headquarters drove through the one street of the\r\nTimber, with the driver muffled in a heavy buffalo-robe coat, residents\r\nof that community gradually lightened his load, audaciously picking off\r\nthe fowls one by one, until all were taken. The driver did not know his\r\nloss until he reached the mess tent.\r\n\r\nWhiskey \"in a tin cup\" was generally supposed to be more enlivening\r\nthan if taken otherwise. One Sunday, as the time for church neared, a\r\ndisappointed minister found only a small group gathered to hear his\r\nsermon. One of the men assured the clergyman, however, that there\r\nwould be more in a few minutes. Taking a bell, he went up and down the\r\nstreet, ringing it and exhorting all Christians to attend an address by\r\nRev. O. H. Elmer of Moorhead, \"whiskey in a tin cup to be served free\r\nimmediately after the service.\" A large crowd heard the sermon.\r\n\r\nThe law in early Fargo had its amusing moments. H. S. Back, justice of\r\nthe peace, after performing the first wedding ceremony, invested his\r\n$3 fee in drinks for the crowd. The next day he tried his first case,\r\nfound the prisoner guilty, and fined him $15 and costs. Informed by the\r\nprisoner's attorney that there was only $5 in sight, he changed the\r\nfine to $5 and no costs.\r\n\r\nAt this time Fargo was still Indian territory, and the Lake Superior\r\nand Puget Sound Company, hoping to regain possession of the town site,\r\ninformed the Government that residents of the Timber were illegally\r\nlocated on Indian lands, and were also selling liquor. On the evening\r\nof February 16, 1872, troops passed through the city and camped for\r\nthe night near General Rosser's headquarters on the Prairie. The\r\ntroops, it was said, were on their way west to fight Indians, but a\r\ncommotion before daylight the next morning awakened the Timber to find\r\nsoldiers stationed before the door of each dwelling. All residents\r\nof the community were arrested and taken to the tent that served as\r\na temporary jail, and those for whom the soldiers had warrants for\r\nselling liquor were removed to Pembina for trial. The others were\r\nordered to leave the city lest their property be confiscated and\r\nburned and they be removed by force. They were not so easily defeated,\r\nhowever, and appealed to the Government for their land rights. A treaty\r\nwas made with the Indians whereby the land was opened to settlement\r\nand those residents of the Timber who were guilty of no other offense\r\nwere allowed to hold their land according to their original claims.\r\n\r\nFrom a virgin prairie land where the Sioux battled the Chippewa, the\r\nterrain around Fargo became a rich farming country, well peopled\r\nand with acres of land sown to wheat. As late as 1868 the Red River\r\nValley was generally believed to be a barren country, and in the early\r\nseventies Cass County was still a Sioux reservation. The first wheat\r\nsown by the acre was harvested in 1872, and there was barely enough\r\ngrain to make bread for the few people in the vicinity. James Holes,\r\nwhose farm was one mile north of the Northern Pacific depot in what is\r\nnow Holes' addition to the city of Fargo, complained to the railroad\r\nthat the exorbitant freight rate of 30c a bushel from Fargo to Duluth\r\nmade wheat raising unprofitable for anything but local consumption.\r\nFreight rates were reduced in 1873, and Holes' 175-acre crop brought\r\nhim nearly $5,000 in 1876 and by 1893 he was harvesting a 1,600-acre\r\ntract.\r\n\r\nBonanza farms, demonstrating the profit in large scale wheat raising,\r\nwere largely responsible for the enormous increase in acreage and the\r\nequally large gain in population through immigration.\r\n\r\nThe influx of new settlers who came on the first train of the Northern\r\nPacific across the Red River June 8, 1872 brought law and order to the\r\ncity. Even the saloons felt the difference--one of them closed every\r\nSunday, and an admonition printed on its curtains read, \"Remember the\r\nSabbath and keep it holy.\"\r\n\r\nThe Father Genin Mission House on the Red River above Fargo,\r\nestablished in 1866, was the only place of regular Christian worship\r\nuntil the Episcopal church was built in 1872. The first school was a\r\nprivate one, presided over by Miss Mercy Nelson, aged 15.\r\n\r\nAs the Yuletide season of 1873 approached, Fargo residents laid\r\nplans for a community Christmas celebration. A tree purchased for\r\nthe occasion was stolen, however, and at a mass meeting of protest\r\nthe suspected culprits, Moorhead, Minn., residents, were hanged in\r\neffigy from the railroad bridge. Next morning a mock funeral was\r\nheld; a locomotive and boxcar draped in mourning proceeded slowly to\r\nthe bridge, the effigies were cut down and buried in a snowdrift.\r\nThat night the tree was returned. It was set up at 27 Front Street,\r\nand decorated with silver half dollars, one for each child under 14.\r\nA locomotive headlight was used to illumine the tree. Most of the\r\nchildren had never seen a half dollar, as the coins, intended as\r\nsouvenirs of the occasion, were new at the time.\r\n\r\nAlthough there was traffic on the Red River as early as 1857, not until\r\nthe railroad crossed the Red, and Fargo became the southern terminus\r\nof river transportation, did steamboating boom. In the season of 1872\r\nthree steamers of 100-ton capacity reported carrying 1,000 passengers\r\nand 4,000 tons of goods on trips north. Bonanza farming brought greater\r\nneed for transportation of grain and merchandise and by 1879 river\r\ntraffic was at its height. There were several boatyards at Fargo,\r\nand Government engineers were employed in clearing and improving the\r\nchannel of the river. The Kittson Line, owned by the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany, was the largest line on the river. It successfully outlived\r\nall competitors and enjoyed a monopoly a large part of the time. The\r\nincome from a single eight-day trip of the steamer _Sheyenne_ from\r\nFargo to Fort Garry (Winnipeg, Manitoba) is said to have resulted in a\r\nprofit large enough to cover the entire cost of building the steamer\r\nand the three barges it towed. Construction of the Great Northern\r\nRailway northward through the Red River Valley in 1880, however,\r\ninaugurated the decline of river transportation at Fargo.\r\n\r\nBy 1880 the city had a population of 2,693. An interesting\r\ncross-section view of the community is given by Finlay Dun, a British\r\nagricultural expert who toured the Red River Valley in 1879:\r\n\r\n  \"In Fargo, built of stone and brick, there are already three\r\n  good hotels, and another in contemplation; rather too many\r\n  drinking saloons; a concert and ball room, where recently a grand\r\n  subscription ball was given for which gentlemen's tickets were\r\n  stated to be $25. There is a courthouse and two portly courteous\r\n  judges, and a provost marshall or commandant of police, all those\r\n  important officers holding their appointments from year to year;\r\n  a successful daily newspaper, two corn-merchants, a thriving\r\n  school, while preparations are being made for building churches.\r\n  An Opera-Comique is in successful operation ... (and) from an area\r\n  of many miles the dark-visaged farm-fellows with slouch hats, many\r\n  with blue guernseys, some lumberers in red flannel jackets, and\r\n  occasional Indians, and many half-breeds, congregated in large\r\n  numbers to this opera-house in Fargo.... The immense and varied\r\n  collections of agricultural implements are strikingly indicative of\r\n  the breaking in of new lands. The light wagons are drawn by horses,\r\n  mules, and oxen, but the ox teams are rather the most numerous.\"\r\n\r\nEven as he wrote, Fargo was rapidly changing from a frontier village\r\nto a city, for he says, \"But Fargo is a metropolis compared with the\r\n'primordial cells' of towns budding at roadside stations....\" While\r\nalmost everyone in the city owned a buffalo-robe coat, and one of the\r\nduties of locomotive engineers was to use their steam whistles for fire\r\nalarms, a horse-car line was in operation during the winter of 1879\r\nand 1880; unfortunately the track layers failed to prepare a firm bed\r\nfor the rails and when spring came the track disappeared into the mud.\r\n\r\nEarly in the city's life William G. Fargo offered a premium of $500 for\r\nthe establishment of a newspaper to be called the Fargo _Express_. In\r\norder to secure the bonus A. H. Moore and Seth Boney started a paper\r\nunder that name in June 1873, but payment was withheld for the reason\r\nthat it was printed on the press of the Glyndon, Minn., _Gazette_.\r\nOn January 1, 1874, the Fargo _Express_, the first paper actually\r\nprinted in Fargo, was published and received the promised bonus. From\r\na combination of the _Express_ and seven later papers has emerged\r\nthe Fargo _Forum_, today leading the newspaper field in Fargo and\r\nthe State. The _Normanden_, a Norwegian weekly, successor to the Red\r\nRiver _Posten_ established in 1886, is the only foreign language paper\r\npublished in the city.\r\n\r\nFargo had a private college as early as 1887, but when North Dakota was\r\npreparing for statehood in the late 1880's, and each of the various\r\ncities in the State was trying to annex at least one State-maintained\r\ninstitution, progressive Fargo citizens succeeded in getting the\r\npromise of an agricultural college. There was one close call, when\r\nonly a veto by the governor averted transfer of the school to Valley\r\nCity, but in the fall of 1889 Fargo saw the opening of the North Dakota\r\nAgricultural College. The prairie-land which had been designated as\r\na campus boasted not one building, so rooms were rented from Fargo\r\nCollege until 1891, when the administration building was erected.\r\n\r\nOn a hot windy day in June 1893 the most severe fire in the city's\r\nhistory broke out on Front Street. Burning almost the entire business\r\nsection and northeast part of the city, it left many homeless.\r\nAlthough the four to five million dollar loss was a serious setback,\r\nthe fire marked the end of the wooden era, and rebuilding with brick\r\nbegan at once. For many years a fire festival was held on June 7 to\r\ncelebrate the anniversary of the event which resulted in so many civic\r\nimprovements.\r\n\r\nFour years later, March 31, 1897, the Red River, dammed by an ice jam\r\nnorth of Fargo, began rising, and continued until April 7. Conditions\r\nbecame appalling. Residents who had moved from the first floor of their\r\nhomes were forced to leave for still higher spots via second story\r\nwindows. Merchants carried their stocks up to top floors and attics,\r\nand groceries and the necessities of life were delivered by boat. When\r\nthe Great Northern and Northern Pacific railroad bridges were in danger\r\nof being swept away, locomotives and threshing machines were run out on\r\nthem to hold them down. The Fargo _Forum_ wrote,\r\n\r\n  \"A. N. Hathaway's family left Island Park by crawling out of the\r\n  second story windows. Colonel Morton decided that discretion was\r\n  the better part of valor and retreated ... from his Oak Grove\r\n  residence Saturday night. Passengers from the east this morning saw\r\n  three horses and four cows on the roof of one barn.\"\r\n\r\nLater the paper complained editorially when Congress appropriated only\r\n$200,000 for flood sufferers in the Mississippi and Red River Valleys,\r\nsaying, \"Fargo before the world begging for a handout.... It wouldn't\r\nbuy a good dose of quinine for each resident of the inundated district\r\nto stave off the chill he's sure to have.\" When the waters had subsided\r\nit was found that 18 blocks of sidewalk and 20 blocks of wooden street\r\npaving had floated away. During the flood and the six weeks while the\r\ndebris was being cleared away and the damage repaired, the _Forum_ was\r\npublished without interruption. A temporary office was set up with a\r\nthreshing machine engine furnishing power to operate the presses, and\r\ndeliveries were made by boat.\r\n\r\nThe attractions of open farm lands and expanding industries brought\r\nthousands of settlers to North Dakota, and by the turn of the century\r\nFargo had a population of 9,589. Important among the industries listed\r\nin a 1901 paper were two harness and horse collar factories, one of\r\nwhich issued a 300-page catalogue of its merchandise. One of the larger\r\nwholesale houses was Brown's Bicycle House on Broadway at N. P. Avenue.\r\n\r\nThe city was taking on a metropolitan air. An opera house, seating\r\n1,000, was built in 1893, and belonged to the \"Bread Basket Circuit\"\r\nwhich included Winnipeg, Grand Forks, Crookston, and Brainerd, with\r\nheadquarters at Fargo. Fargo was a favorite \"stopover\" for theater\r\ncompanies, and among the celebrities who thrilled those early audiences\r\nwere Mrs. Fiske in _Becky Sharpe_, and Blanche Walsh and Chauncey\r\nOlcott in _A Run Away Girl_. In 1899 an item in the _Record_, a\r\nmagazine published in Fargo, remarked, \"It is considered quite the\r\nthing to drop in at the Coffee House on Broadway ... between one and\r\nfive p. m. and spend a few moments drinking coffee and chatting, etc.\"\r\nThis fad may have been due to the divorce colony which flourished in\r\nFargo then. A 90-day divorce law was in effect, and the city became the\r\ntemporary abode of many wealthy people who came to establish residence\r\nand obtain a separation from their mates. Lawyers, hotels, cafes, and\r\nbars did a rushing business.\r\n\r\nIn the 30 years between 1900 and 1930 Fargo tripled its population.\r\nAlmost half of its residents are of Norwegian descent. Feeling the\r\neffects of an economic depression in their own country in the late\r\nnineteenth century, thousands of Norwegians, exhorted by transportation\r\ncompanies and influenced by the glowing tales of their countrymen\r\nin the United States, emigrated to North Dakota. Taking advantage of\r\nthe free lands opened to homesteading, they became some of the first\r\nfarmers in the upper Red River Valley and helped settle Fargo. Those\r\nwho made their homes here are today well mingled with the rest of the\r\npopulation and few of their Old World customs are kept alive with\r\nthe exception of the preparation of Norwegian foods such as _lefse_,\r\n_lutefisk_, _fattigmand_, and _flad broed_. (_See_ RACIAL GROUPS AND\r\nFOLKWAYS.) Not forgotten, however, are important national holidays such\r\nas May 17, Norwegian Independence Day, which is celebrated with parades\r\nand appropriate ceremonies. The Norse influence is further seen in the\r\nstatues and sculpture of and by noted Norsemen found throughout the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS OF INTEREST\r\n\r\n1. THE NORTH DAKOTA AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE, 13th St. at 12th Ave. N.,\r\noccupies a level, 100-acre campus in the northwest outskirts of the\r\ncity. The large tree-enclosed square is cut by graveled driveways\r\ncurving between rows of hedges, trees, and clumps of shrubbery\r\nconnecting the irregularly placed, architecturally heterogenous\r\nbuildings.\r\n\r\nUnder the Enabling Act of 1889 North Dakota, upon entering statehood,\r\nbecame possessed of a Federal grant of 40,000 acres for an agricultural\r\ncollege. A year later the first State legislature took advantage of\r\nthe earlier Morrill Land Grant Act, and acquired an additional 90,000\r\nacres of Federal lands. Proceeds from these lands, together with\r\nCongressional appropriations, have created an endowment fund that\r\nenables the school to offer courses at a minimum tuition fee and to\r\nconduct extensive agricultural experiments.\r\n\r\nA group of only five students under the supervision of eight\r\ninstructors gathered October 15, 1890, for the opening classes, held\r\nin quarters rented from Fargo College, but before the end of the term\r\nthe enrollment was 122. Elaborate dedication services for the college\r\nwere planned in connection with the laying of the cornerstone of the\r\nadministration building the following spring. After the program had\r\nbegun it was discovered, to the consternation of the participants, that\r\nthere was no flag available for the ceremony. A quick-witted student\r\nsaved the day by contriving a makeshift pennant from a pair of overalls.\r\n\r\nFrom the entrance at 12th Ave. N. and 13th St., a graveled road makes\r\na loop through the campus. Past the TENNIS COURTS (R) is a TABLET (L)\r\nof Norwegian granite, in which is set a medallion of Bjornstjerne\r\nBjornson, Norwegian poet and patriot. Best known as author of the\r\nNorwegian national anthem _Ja vi elsker dette landet_ (Yes, I love\r\nthis land), Bjornson was also a prominent exponent of scientific\r\nagriculture. The medallion is the work of Sigvold Asbjornson, Norwegian\r\nsculptor.\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATION BUILDING (R), a two-story red brick and sandstone\r\nstructure, shows architectural influence of the Medieval and Romanesque\r\nperiods. On the second floor is the LITTLE COUNTRY THEATER, founded\r\nin 1914 as a country-life laboratory by Prof. A. G. Arvold, head of\r\nthe department of public discussion and social life. With facilities\r\navailable in the average rural community, students are taught to\r\npresent entertainments which will provide recreation and education for\r\nthe communities in which they expect to live.\r\n\r\nThe LIBRARY (L), of Classic design, contains nearly 55,000 volumes, and\r\nis a depository for United States Government documents. The ENGINEERING\r\nBUILDING (R), including the engineering and architectural departments,\r\nis a neoclassic structure of pressed brick with sandstone trim. As\r\nthe road turns R., SCIENCE HALL, a rambling brick structure, is L.\r\nIt houses the schools of science, literature, and education, and the\r\nlaboratories of the experimental station where research is conducted\r\nin botany and plant pathology. A three-section GREENHOUSE (L) is\r\nmaintained in connection with this department.\r\n\r\nThe AGRICULTURE BUILDING (L), a three-story tile-roofed structure\r\nshowing influences of Roman and Spanish architecture, houses the school\r\nof agriculture, offices of the experimental station, and the extension\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\nRight is the CHEMISTRY BUILDING. FRANCES HALL (L) houses the farm\r\nmanagement division and the school of pharmacy. The DAIRY BUILDING and\r\nthe old BARRACKS are R.\r\n\r\nAt the next curve of the road are the FARM BUILDINGS of the agriculture\r\ndivision (L and R). Just before reaching 13th St. the road passes the\r\nPHYSICAL EDUCATION BUILDING (L), erected in 1930. It has an indoor\r\ntrack, swimming pool, and auditorium with seating capacity of 3,600.\r\nAthletic events featured today at the college with its modern gymnasium\r\nand floodlighted football field were impossible during early days at\r\nthe school, for even if enough students had been enrolled to allow\r\nfootball and basketball teams, there was no athletic coach, and lack\r\nof transportation facilities prohibited games with other colleges.\r\nIn those days one of the chief pastimes of the students was bronco\r\nbusting, facilities for which were readily available.\r\n\r\nRight on 13th St. is the MEN'S DORMITORY (R) and the home economics\r\nPRACTICE HOUSE (R). The SCHOOL OF RELIGION (L), of modern design in\r\nwhite stucco, originally conducted as a branch of Wesley College, has\r\nbeen turned over to the agricultural college under a 99-year rent-free\r\nlease of its buildings and equipment, together with a charter for\r\nconferring degrees in religion.\r\n\r\nRight on a campus road is CERES HALL (R), named for the goddess of\r\ngrain, and housing the women's dormitory, gymnasium, and the home\r\neconomics department. FESTIVAL HALL (R) is used for R. O. T. C. drill,\r\ncollege entertainments, proms, and informal dances. The FOOTBALL FIELD\r\nis R. of Festival Hall.\r\n\r\nAn outstanding organization on the campus is the Gold Star Band which\r\nis part of the college R. O. T. C. unit. Directed since 1902 by Dr.\r\nC. S. Putnam, it participates in special military events, appears at\r\nathletic contests, and has made several tours through North Dakota and\r\nMinnesota.\r\n\r\nWith its campus on the plains of the Red River Valley where great herds\r\nof buffalo once roamed, it is appropriate that the school should have\r\nthe bison as its insignia. The college emblem is a green and yellow\r\nshield (the college colors) bearing the letters \"N D\" surmounted by a\r\nbison. The traditional Homecoming banquet held each fall features a\r\nbison barbecue.\r\n\r\nThe college maintains an extension division and experimental stations.\r\nThe extension service includes the formation of agricultural clubs in\r\nrural communities and at the college, and administers Federal funds\r\nallotted the State for agricultural education. A primary function\r\nof the experimental department is the study of plant diseases and\r\nthe development of disease-resistant grains. H. L. Bolley, a member\r\nof the faculty, discovered the formaldehyde treatment of seed for\r\nthe prevention of smut on wheat and other grains and perfected a\r\nwilt-resistant flax while using these experimental facilities.\r\n\r\n2. UNITED STATES VETERANS ADMINISTRATION FACILITY (_visiting hours: 2-5\r\nand 7-9 p. m._), 19th Ave. at the NE. edge of the city, is generally\r\nreferred to as the Veterans' Hospital. Erected in 1929, the three-story\r\nbrick veneer hospital contains 100 beds, 92 percent of which are filled\r\nthroughout the year. The grounds cover 50 acres; they are beautifully\r\nlandscaped, with sunken gardens, ivy arbor, sundial, and Japanese\r\ngates. A rock garden was partially financed by the \"40-and-8,\" a\r\nveterans' organization.\r\n\r\n3. BLACK BUILDING, 114-118 Bdwy., is one of the few buildings in North\r\nDakota of skyscraper proportions. Designed by Lang, Raugland, and Lewis\r\nof Minneapolis, with Brasseth and Houkom of Fargo as associates, it is\r\nconstructed of concrete, steel, and white brick faced with blocks of\r\nIndiana limestone with contrasting black spandrels between the windows.\r\nConsisting of eight floors and basement, it rises 122 feet above the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  AN EARLY\r\n  SCHOOL\r\n\r\n  (Oliver\r\n  County,\r\n  1885).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ADMINISTRATION BUILDING,\r\n  AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE, FARGO]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n                                                              THRESHING\r\n\r\n  _Photo by Kermit Overby_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAKAKAWEA, BISMARCK]\r\n\r\nRADIO STATION WDAY has its studios on the top floor. The oldest\r\ncommercial station in North Dakota, it began to function in May 1922,\r\noperating on 100 watts. In March 1931 it became an associate member\r\nof the National Broadcasting Company, and a number of chain programs,\r\nincluding several from the agricultural college, have originated in its\r\nstudios.\r\n\r\n4. FIRST LUTHERAN CHURCH, 619 Bdwy., is of English Gothic architecture,\r\na modern adaptation of the cathedrals erected in northern Europe\r\nin the sixteenth century. It was designed by Magney and Tussler of\r\nMinneapolis. The interior appointments are simple and severe, following\r\nthe traditional arrangement for formal Lutheran services. In an arched\r\nsanctuary is the altar of golden Sienna marble. The congregation\r\nrepresents a consolidation of two church groups, the Norwegian\r\nEvangelical Lutheran Church founded in Moorhead in 1874 and moved to\r\nFargo four years later, and St. Paul's Evangelical Lutheran, organized\r\nin Fargo in 1903.\r\n\r\n5. FIRST PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH, cor. 8th St. and 2nd Ave. N., in modified\r\nEnglish Gothic style, is of Faribault gray sandstone with slate roof,\r\nin cruciform construction. It was designed by Lang, Raugland, and\r\nLewis of Minneapolis, with William F. Kurke of Fargo as associate. The\r\naltar was hand-carved by a cousin of Anton Lang, the _Christus_ of the\r\nPassion Play at Oberammergau.\r\n\r\nThe three-manual pipe organ is a gift of Mr. and Mrs. Norman B.\r\nBlack of Fargo. A stained glass window, designed by Homer L. Huntoon\r\nand presented by him in 1932 in memory of his wife and infant son,\r\ncontains three panels, the central one of which depicts the sacrifice\r\nof motherhood, showing a young mother with her baby kneeling before an\r\nangel who holds the chalice and host, symbols of redemption. Art and\r\nmusic are represented in the two side panels.\r\n\r\n6. UNITED STATES POST OFFICE AND COURTHOUSE, 705 1st Ave. N., erected\r\nin 1929-30 at a cost of $600,000, is in Italian Renaissance style,\r\nbuilt of reinforced concrete faced with limestone. Ninety tons of steel\r\nwere used in the first floor, making it strong enough to support 10\r\nstories in addition to its present three.\r\n\r\n7. FARGO'S FIRST HOUSE (_private_), 119 4th St. S., is the home of Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Henry Hector. It was built in 1871 of oak logs cut in what is\r\nnow Island Park, and, although used for two years as a hotel, it was\r\noriginally intended as the home of A. H. Moore, United States marshall.\r\n\r\n8. CASS COUNTY'S FIRST COURTHOUSE, 708 1st Ave. S., has been remodeled\r\ninto the DeVolne Flats. This two-story gray frame building has had a\r\nvaried existence. Built in 1874, it served for 11 years as the seat of\r\nthe county government. It was then moved to the corner of Seventh and\r\nFront Streets and used for a Government land office until October 4,\r\n1886, when the construction of a new Northern Pacific depot made it\r\nnecessary that the building be again moved, this time to Eighth Street.\r\nIt remained there for a few months, then was sold for $500 and moved to\r\nits present location where it became the first club rooms for the Fargo\r\nY. M. C. A.\r\n\r\n9. MASONIC GRAND LODGE MUSEUM (_open weekdays 9-5_), 501 1st Ave. N.,\r\nhouses the Masonic Library, the only lodge library in the State. The\r\nmuseum includes exhibits ranging from Indian artifacts and historical\r\nrelics to religious articles. Fargo's first sewing machine was donated\r\nto the lodge because its owner found it so \"noisy to run.\"\r\n\r\nThe library specializes in genealogical research for Masonic families.\r\nOriginally it was part of the museum and contained only copies of rare\r\nbooks. The lodge members became interested in a State-wide program of\r\nadult education, and began a lending library of non-fiction books. A\r\ncollection of 800 rare volumes, a gift to the library of T. S. Parvin,\r\nsecretary of the Iowa grand lodge, was destroyed in the Fargo fire; the\r\nlibrary later bought Mr. Parvin's entire private collection. Important\r\nitems include _Orationes Philelphi_ printed in 1491; a collection\r\nof Bibles dating from the time of King Christian III of Denmark\r\n(1503-1559); a copy of the first printed constitution of Freemasonry,\r\ndated 1723; and histories of some of the early guides.\r\n\r\n10. MONUMENT TO GANGE ROLF, Bdwy. at 5th Ave. N., stands in the Great\r\nNorthern depot park. Rollo, as Gange Rolf was also known, entered\r\nFrance in 909 with a band of Northmen, and founded Rouen. Two years\r\nlater he installed himself Duke of Normandy. His line through William\r\nthe Conqueror became the royal house of England in 1066, and the\r\nreigning family of Norway in 1905. The statue, a gift of the Society of\r\nNormandy to the Norse people of America, was unveiled in 1912 on the\r\n1001st anniversary of the founding of Normandy.\r\n\r\n11. ISLAND PARK, Bdwy. at Red River, Fargo's first park, was donated\r\nfor a recreational center in 1877 by the Northern Pacific Railway. It\r\nwas undeveloped until the early 1880's when the city council undertook\r\nthe task of landscaping. In the attractive grounds are various athletic\r\nfacilities and a building that serves as a community center.\r\n\r\nA granite MONUMENT in a fenced plot near the south driveway was\r\nintended for a sundial but was never completed. The oddly phrased\r\nreligious sentiments on the sides are by O. W. Lien of Breckenridge,\r\nMinn., donor of the shaft, who said they were dictated to him by a\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nNear the west drive is a bronze MONUMENT TO HENRIK WERGELAND, a\r\nNorwegian poet noted for his efforts in opening the doors of Norway\r\nto the Jews and the naming of May 17 as Norwegian Independence Day.\r\nThe monument is a gift of the Norwegian people to North Dakota and was\r\npresented during the Wergeland centenary in 1908.\r\n\r\n12. OAK GROVE PARK (_tennis courts_, _horseshoe courts_, _playground\r\napparatus_, _soft-ball diamonds_, _wading pool, picnic facilities_),\r\non the Red River, has entrances at the E. end of 6th and 7th Aves. N.,\r\nknown as South and North Terrace. So sharp are the curves of the river\r\nthat at one point one can look from North Dakota west into Minnesota.\r\nOak Grove covers 39 acres.\r\n\r\n13. EL ZAGAL PARK (_private_), 1411 Bdwy., is the property of the El\r\nZagal Shrine Club. On the nine-hole golf course is the El Zagal Bowl,\r\na natural amphitheater, used during the summer months for concerts and\r\ndramatic presentations. Programs each year include recitals by the\r\nAmphion Male Chorus of Fargo and Moorhead. North from the park are\r\nNorth Drive, which follows the Red River, and Memorial Drive, leading\r\nto Edgewood Park.\r\n\r\n14. DOVRE SKI SLIDE, 1-1/2 m. N. of 19th Ave. on N. Bdwy., when\r\ncompleted in 1935, was the highest artificial ski scaffold in the\r\nUnited States. At its highest point it is 140 feet from the ground.\r\nReaching their maximum speed at the end of the runway, 300 feet from\r\nthe top of the slide, skiers land on a hillside leading to the Red\r\nRiver, and complete their slide in Minnesota.\r\n\r\n15. GOOD SAMARITAN SCHOOL FOR CRIPPLED CHILDREN, 716 7th St. S.,\r\nstands on the site of a log cabin, the birthplace on August 27, 1871,\r\nof Anna Thoresen, later Mrs. Anna Roe, first white girl born in Fargo\r\nand Cass County. The school is housed in the buildings once occupied\r\nby the first college in the city, Fargo College, founded in 1887 as a\r\nCongregational school. The campus and main building had a beautiful\r\nsetting overlooking Island Park. A shrinking income closed the school\r\nin 1919. In 1933, sponsored by the Good Samaritan Society, it became\r\na school for crippled children, a private organization dependent upon\r\ndonations from churches, fraternal societies, and other sources. It\r\noperates as a boarding school, with vocational training and academic\r\ncourses from the first grade through high school.\r\n\r\n16. On the SITE OF THE HEADQUARTERS HOTEL, between Bdwy. and 7th St.\r\nS., N. of the Northern Pacific Railway, stood a large two-story frame\r\nbuilding which was the railroad station, hotel, and social center of\r\nFargo during its early days. Built by the Northern Pacific in 1872,\r\nthe hotel was formally opened April 1 the following year. After a\r\ndisastrous fire in 1874 it was rebuilt by Fargo business men at a\r\ncost of $45,000. The new three-story combined hotel and depot was a\r\nprominent landmark, visible for many miles on the flat prairie. Around\r\nit flowed the life and business of the little frontier settlement and\r\nthrough it filed the men and women who helped make the history of the\r\nWest. Its register carried the names of such notables as President\r\nU. S. Grant and Gen. William T. Sherman. Gen. George A. Custer and\r\nGen. Nelson A. Miles often stayed there on their way to and from\r\nthe frontier. A menu preserved from the hotel's Christmas dinner in\r\n1887 lists the following game dishes: \"wild turkey, stuffed chestnut\r\ndressing; possum with browned sweet potatoes; partridge with English\r\nbread sauce; baked squirrel; saddle of venison, currant jelly; young\r\nblack bear; antelope, game sauce; buffalo steak; reed birds _a la\r\nprovencale_; broiled quail on toast\"--and any of these for 50 cents.\r\nOne of the few buildings to escape the fire of 1893, the hotel burned\r\nin 1899.\r\n\r\n17. ST. MARY'S CATHEDRAL, Bdwy. at 6th Ave. N., seat of the diocese\r\nof Fargo since 1891, is a red brick structure showing influences of\r\nClassic and Gothic style. A prominent feature is a 190-foot bell tower\r\nand steeple topped with a bronze cross. On the northeast corner of\r\nthe building a small tower forms a niche and canopy for a heroic size\r\nstatue of the Virgin Mary. In bas-relief on either side of the east\r\nwindow over the entrance portals are figures of SS. Peter and Paul. The\r\ncathedral, completed in 1899, was dedicated by Bishop John Shanley,\r\nfirst Roman Catholic Bishop of North Dakota.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS OF INTEREST IN ENVIRONS\r\n\r\n  Armour Packing Plant and Union Stockyards, West Fargo, =5 m.= (_see\r\n  Tour 8_).

The broad low profile of the city, dominated by the\r\nState Mill and Elevator and the radio station towers, is visible long\r\nbefore it is reached. Even the many trees do not obstruct the view, for\r\nthey grow chiefly along the river, roughly paralleling the highway.\r\n\r\nLike other small Midwest cities, Grand Forks is a heterogeneous mixture\r\nof nineteenth century and modern architecture. The south part of town,\r\nalong US 81 and its neighboring streets, is the finest residential\r\ndistrict. University Avenue, lined with rooming houses and quiet homes,\r\nculminates in an architectural spectacle along Fraternity Row, an\r\nimpressive group of houses vying for prominence and grandeur.\r\n\r\nMeat packing, milling, and processing of other agricultural products\r\nconstitute the city's chief industries. The largest railroad terminal\r\nbetween St. Paul and Seattle, Grand Forks is headquarters of the\r\nDakota Division of the Great Northern Railway, the largest division in\r\nthe world, containing more than 1,800 miles of main line track. The\r\nNorthern Pacific Railway and several truck lines add to the shipping\r\nfacilities.\r\n\r\nThe State university is not only a material asset of the city, but is\r\na vital part of its intellectual and social life. University musical\r\nand dramatic performances are popular with townsfolk, college parties\r\nand proms are leading society events, and athletic contests draw a\r\nlarge attendance, not only from the city but from the entire northeast\r\nsection of the State.\r\n\r\nIt is thought that the early French-Canadian explorers of North Dakota\r\nmay have given this site the name of Grandes Fourches; by this name it\r\nwas commonly known to the French fur traders of the late eighteenth\r\ncentury. In 1801, under direction of Alexander Henry, Jr., John Cameron\r\nestablished a North West Company depot here. Where Henry's men traded\r\nfurs with the Indians, Grand Forks stands, the second largest city\r\nin the State, and hub of a rich agricultural region in the Red River\r\nValley.\r\n\r\nNothing is known of the occupants of the first house in Grand Forks, a\r\ntumble-down shack discovered by travelers near the shores of the Red\r\nRiver in the early 1850's. The site is now occupied by the warming\r\nhouse of the Central Park skating rink.\r\n\r\nIn 1868 Nicholas Hoffman and August Loon, carrying mail from Fort\r\nAbercrombie to Fort Pembina, built a log cabin at the present corner of\r\nEighth Avenue South and Almonte. They used it as an overnight shelter\r\non the long trip across the prairies.\r\n\r\nFollowing his expedition by dogsled through Dakota in 1860, James J.\r\nHill, who later built the Great Northern Railway, sent Capt. Alexander\r\nGriggs to explore the Red River. By the fall of 1870 Griggs had built\r\nup a good freighting business, using flatboats to carry his cargoes.\r\nGeorge Winship, later publisher of the Grand Forks _Herald_, also went\r\ninto the flatboat freight business and a friendly rivalry developed\r\nbetween the two commanders and their crews.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion Winship loaded two flatboats with merchandise at\r\nMcCauleyville, scheduled for Pembina. At the same time Captain Griggs\r\nwas loading a fleet of flatboats destined for Fort Garry (Winnipeg).\r\nWinship set out a half day before Griggs finished loading, but Griggs'\r\ncrew boasted they could overtake the rival fleet. At the Goose Rapids\r\nWinship was forced by low water and the rocky channel to reload his\r\nentire cargo to a \"lighter,\" a two-day task. Toward evening of the\r\nsecond day shouts up the river announced Griggs' arrival at the head\r\nof the rapids. Confident of keeping their lead, Winship and his crew\r\ntied up for the night. Before morning a violent storm washed overboard\r\nseveral kegs of beer which were part of their cargo. All were retrieved\r\nbut one, which floated unnoticed downstream, to be salvaged by the\r\nGriggs crew. As a result of the ensuing party most of Griggs' men\r\nwere incapacitated, and he was forced to tie up his fleet at Grandes\r\nFourches to await recovery.\r\n\r\nWinship reached Pembina safely, but before Griggs could proceed the\r\nriver froze, and he was forced to unload his cargo and store it in\r\nimprovised sheds. His crew, with no alternative but to spend the winter\r\nhere, were the first white people known to have domiciled on the site\r\nof Grand Forks.\r\n\r\nCaptain Griggs built a squatter cabin at the mouth of the Red Lake\r\nRiver, and after a trip to St. Paul in 1871 built the first frame house\r\nin the settlement on the bank of the Red River, at the foot of what is\r\nnow Kittson Avenue, and brought his family to the new community.\r\n\r\nIn its early years Grand Forks was a typical river town, developing\r\ninto an important station for the heavy river and oxcart traffic on\r\nthe St. Paul-Fort Garry trail. Dwellings began to dot the prairie\r\nbeside the river, log huts and crude frame structures built from the\r\nproduct of Captain Griggs' sawmill. A post office was established in\r\n1871, and mail arrived once or twice a week by dog team. In the same\r\nyear a telegraph station was established, on the first line in the\r\nState, running between Fort Abercrombie and Winnipeg. It was about this\r\ntime that the English pronunciation of the community's name came into\r\ngeneral use.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1872 there was much unemployment and saloons were\r\nfilled with idle men. During this winter \"Catfish Joe,\" a half-witted\r\nFrenchman, murdered a local character known as Old Man Stevens who,\r\nwhile intoxicated, called him uncomplimentary names. The saloon crowd\r\ndecided on a lynching, and all through the night plans were discussed,\r\nbut with so many rounds of drinks that action was impossible. Catfish\r\nJoe was tried for murder at Yankton, spent two years in prison,\r\nand returned to terrify Grand Forks by strutting about the streets\r\ndecorated with a bowie knife and a Winchester. One courageous townsman,\r\nBert Haney, seized the gun and struck Joe a terrific blow on the head,\r\nbreaking the rifle barrel from the stock, but with no damage to Joe's\r\nhead. Catfish Joe later went to Montana where he murdered his partner\r\nfor refusing to get up in the night and prepare breakfast.\r\n\r\nBy the spring of 1872 Captain Griggs' sawmill was doing a flourishing\r\nbusiness, turning out lumber for building and repairing river boats\r\nand barges. Logs were cut and floated down the river to Winnipeg.\r\nWhen Frank Viets opened the first flour mill in the Red River Valley\r\nat Grand Forks in 1877, he added another industry to the growing\r\nsettlement. The Hudson's Bay Company operated a store, managed by\r\nViets, who purchased it when the company moved to Winnipeg in 1877.\r\n\r\nSince five families in the city had children of school age in 1873, it\r\nbecame necessary to establish a school. As some of the families lived\r\non North Third Street and others in the Lincoln Park area, they could\r\nnot agree on a suitable location, and each faction held a school of its\r\nown. Claim shanties served as school buildings, and a drayman, one of\r\nCaptain Griggs' hired men, taught the north end school.\r\n\r\nThere was no dentist in the community in the early days of Grand Forks.\r\nAlex Walstrom, a blacksmith, used a pair of homemade tongs about two\r\nfeet long to pull aching teeth.\r\n\r\nOn October 26, 1875, Captain Griggs filed a plat of the original town\r\nsite of Grand Forks, covering 90 acres of his claim. The following\r\nspring Viets filed the plat of his first addition. In 1879 the village\r\nof Grand Forks was organized and three years later was incorporated as\r\na city.\r\n\r\nAlthough life at the little river post lacked many refinements, the\r\nsocial aspect was not entirely neglected. Weddings were carried out\r\nwith pomp and ceremony, and anniversaries appropriately celebrated. A\r\npopular social custom, New Year calling, was introduced on January 1,\r\n1876. Groups of men rode together in sleighs to call on their friends,\r\nand then drove to the Hudson's Bay Company store, purchased flour,\r\nsugar, tea, and other necessities, which they took to the homes of the\r\ndestitute.\r\n\r\nUntil 1879 traffic moved by steamboat or stage, but the coming of the\r\nGreat Northern Railway in that year brought the rapid decline of both\r\nthese early modes of transportation. Their end was hastened by the\r\nextension of the Northern Pacific Railway from Crookston, Minn., to\r\nGrand Forks two years later.\r\n\r\nGeorge Walsh founded the _Plaindealer_, the first newspaper northwest\r\nof Fargo, in 1874, and published it without competition for five years\r\nuntil George Winship started the _Herald_. There began a continuous\r\nquarrel between the two editors which was at times decidedly heated,\r\nalthough when the plant of the _Plaindealer_ burned in 1884 Winship\r\nshared his equipment with Walsh. While acknowledging the courtesy,\r\nthe _Plaindealer_ continued to attack the editorial policies of its\r\nbenefactor. Winship eventually purchased his rival's paper and merged\r\nit with the _Herald_, which since 1881 has been published as a daily.\r\nThe late J. D. Bacon, when publisher of the _Herald_, established\r\nthe Lilac Hedge Farm northwest of Grand Forks to demonstrate the\r\npracticability of diversified agriculture and the value of using\r\npurebred stock.\r\n\r\nColonel Viets' mill on South Third Street was one of the first\r\nindustries established in the city, and was the only flour mill until\r\n1882, when John McDonald founded a mill at the present corner of Fifth\r\nStreet and Kittson Avenue. This was operated later by the Diamond\r\nMilling Company and then sold to the Russell-Miller Milling Company.\r\n\r\nCream of Wheat was first processed in Grand Forks and was manufactured\r\nlocally for a number of years about the turn of the century, before the\r\nmanufacturer moved to Minneapolis.\r\n\r\nIn Grand Forks politics and the weather were of great importance.\r\nElections were always exciting. When D. M. Holmes ran for mayor in\r\n1886 his friend James J. Hill ordered all Great Northern trains of\r\nthe north, south, and west lines to run into Grand Forks so that the\r\ntrain crews could vote for Holmes. Against such odds Holmes' opponent\r\nwithdrew.\r\n\r\nA tornado that struck Grand Forks in June 1887 killed two women and\r\nwrecked many buildings. Ten years later the city experienced one\r\nof the worst floods in its history. The Red River made an all-time\r\nrecord by flowing four miles an hour. Houses along the river flats\r\nwere floating or completely submerged. The piers of the west approach\r\nof the Minnesota Avenue bridge were swept by ice, and the Northern\r\nPacific tracks were under water. When water filled the basement of the\r\n_Herald_ building, the staff was forced to resort to hand composition\r\nto continue publication. Many families lived in second stories, and on\r\nnearby farms platforms were built on the roofs of barns and fenced in\r\nfor the livestock, which was fed from boats.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 a brick plant was established in Grand Forks, and another in\r\n1900. Other industries which sprang up during this period were bottling\r\nworks, breweries, and foundries. Besides the Grand Forks _Herald_,\r\ntwo weeklies were established, the _Red River Valley Citizen_ and the\r\n_Normanden_, the latter in the Norwegian language.\r\n\r\nIn 1919 a group of farmers and business men from Grand Forks and the\r\nsurrounding territory opened the Northern Packing Company, designed\r\nto handle 500 hogs and 150 cattle and sheep daily, with a plant one\r\nand one-half miles north of the city (_see Tour 1_). The State Mill\r\nand Elevator began operation in 1922 (_see Tour 1_). A candy company\r\nthat uses locally produced beet sugar has an annual output of about\r\n1,000,000 pounds. A large potato warehouse with laboratory and\r\nexperimental department was constructed in 1935 at the corner of North\r\nThird Street and Lewis Boulevard.\r\n\r\nThe population of Grand Forks has increased from 200 in 1873 to 17,112\r\nin 1930, and is composed of many nationalities, although more than 75\r\npercent of the native whites are of Norwegian or Canadian descent. A\r\nsmall section of the city bounded by Sixth and Eighth Avenues North and\r\nTwentieth and Twenty-third Streets North is a Scandinavian community\r\ndesignated locally as \"Little Norway.\" Here Norwegian is spoken almost\r\nexclusively by the older people, although the children have acquired\r\nAmerican speech and habits. Norwegian Independence Day, _Syttende Mai_\r\n(May 17), is celebrated by the residents of this district and their\r\nhomes are then decorated with Norwegian flags. Much political activity\r\nof an earlier period centered about this little community, since it\r\ngenerally voted as a bloc. Politicians of that day believed that the\r\ncandidate who was most liberal with ale would receive the community's\r\nvote, and on the eve of election torchlight parades marched through the\r\nstreets of this district and candidates for office generously dispensed\r\nboth oratory and beer.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS OF INTEREST\r\n\r\n1. FEDERAL BUILDING, 1st. Ave. N. at N. 4th St., houses the post\r\noffice, United States courtroom, a branch of the United States\r\nImmigration Service, and the Federal Reemployment office. The\r\nsuperstructure is of white Bedford stone and pressed brick, with a base\r\nof solid granite. It has a 12-foot cornice of stone with carved and\r\nblocked ornaments. The lobby has marble floors and high wainscoting\r\nof marble, contrasting shades being used for borders. Fixtures are of\r\nquarter-sawed oak.\r\n\r\n2. CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL, 1st and 2nd Aves. N. between 4th and 5th Sts.,\r\nhas an auditorium unit constructed entirely without windows. It was\r\nthe first public building in North Dakota to utilize indirect lighting\r\nthroughout. It was erected in 1936-37 with WPA assistance at a cost of\r\n$275,000, and includes a pipe organ, the gift of the Grand Forks Music\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\n3. SORLIE MEMORIAL BRIDGE across the Red River connects Grand Forks, N.\r\nDak., and East Grand Forks, Minn., on US 2. It is dedicated to the late\r\nA. G. Sorlie, former Governor of the State, and was built in 1929.\r\n\r\n4. RADIO STATION KFJM (_open daily 2:30-5 p.m._), top floor of the\r\nFirst National Bank Bldg., cor. DeMers Ave. and N. 4th St., is one of\r\nthe few State-owned university radio stations in the United States. It\r\nis leased to a local company. A studio is maintained at the university.\r\n\r\n5. TRIANGLE APARTMENTS, 5th and Chestnut Sts. and 5th Ave. S., mark\r\nthe site of two of the most important buildings in early Grand Forks\r\nhistory. The city's first school building stood across the street\r\nfrom this triangle, on the courthouse site. In 1883 the old building\r\nwas moved into the triangle and converted into the Park Hotel. The\r\nArlington House, a hotel built by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1873, was\r\nalso moved to this lot and in 1906 Col. Andrew Knutson purchased both\r\nbuildings and operated them as the Arlington-Park Hotel. This hotel was\r\ntorn down in recent years and the lumber used in the construction of\r\nthe apartment building that now occupies the site.\r\n\r\n6. GRAND FORKS COUNTY COURTHOUSE, 4th and 5th Sts. S. between Kittson\r\nand Bruce Aves., was erected in 1913 and designed by Buechner and Orth\r\nof St. Paul. It is a three-story Indiana limestone building of modified\r\nClassic design, with a figure of Justice surmounting its dome. The\r\nhalls are finished in white marble with mural decorations. Embellishing\r\nthe upper part of the rotunda are four painted lunettes showing typical\r\nNorth Dakota scenes.\r\n\r\n7. SOLDIER'S MONUMENT, 6th St. S. and Belmont Rd., was donated by\r\nGeorge B. Winship, early newspaper publisher, as a memorial to 168\r\nlocal Civil War veterans, whose names are engraved on a bronze tablet.\r\nMounted on a square base of Vermont granite, the monument represents a\r\nUnion soldier \"at rest.\"\r\n\r\n8. CENTRAL PARK (_picnicking not allowed_), Red River bank, S. end of\r\n3rd St., is a beauty spot and playground. The flower gardens, a mass of\r\nbrilliant bloom, are lighted at night. At the bandstand in the center\r\nof the park concerts are presented, usually each week, during the\r\nsummer months. In front of the bandstand are millstones from the first\r\nflour mill in the Red River Valley, which was built on the site of the\r\ncity waterworks plant in 1877. An outdoor skating rink is lighted for\r\nwinter skating. The warming house is on the site of the first building\r\nerected within the present boundaries of the city. Across the drive\r\nfrom the ball diamond are the toboggan slides, partially hidden from\r\nview by evergreen trees and shrubs.\r\n\r\n9. UNIVERSITY PARK (_playground equipment and supervised play_),\r\nUniversity Ave. bet. 24th and 25th Sts., has a children's library at\r\nthe clubhouse, and children's band concerts (_weekly, June-July_) are\r\ngiven by the university band.\r\n\r\n10. LINCOLN PARK (_municipal golf links, tennis courts, ski slide,\r\npicnic and play equipment_), Belmont Rd. at S. edge of city, contains\r\nthe old Red River Oxcart Trail (_see Tour 1_) which crossed the little\r\nhill on which the clubhouse stands. Later, when the settlement became\r\na stage station on the St. Paul-Fort Garry Trail, the Stewart House\r\nwas built here and housed Grand Forks' first post office. This old log\r\nbuilding is now the kitchen of the clubhouse.\r\n\r\n11. UNIVERSITY OF NORTH DAKOTA is at the W. end of University Ave. 2 m.\r\nfrom the principal business section of Grand Forks. (_University bus at\r\n3rd St. and DeMers Ave., fare 10c._)\r\n\r\nThe campus facing the avenue is bordered by a low hedge, and the two\r\nmain entrances are marked by large brick pylons. Tree-shaded roads\r\nwind past the buildings and along the banks of English Coulee. In the\r\nspring and summer the wide expanses of green lawn are broken by plots\r\nof flowers and clumps of lilacs, spires, and flowering almond. All of\r\nthe buildings erected since 1910 are in modern collegiate Gothic style,\r\na modification of true English Gothic architecture adapted especially\r\nfor educational institutions.\r\n\r\nThe University of North Dakota was established by the Territorial\r\nLegislature before North Dakota became a State. The cornerstone for\r\n\"Old Main\" was laid October 12, 1883, on the prairie beside the banks\r\nof the winding English Coulee, and September 8, 1884, the university\r\nopened classes with 79 students and a staff of 4 instructors.\r\nEnrollment now numbers almost 3,000 students and the school has more\r\nthan 130 instructors.\r\n\r\nSelection of a site two miles from the city was opposed by many of the\r\ntownspeople who thought the university should be located at the south\r\nend of Third Street, on the present site of Central Park. During the\r\ntornado of 1887 the roof of Old Main, then the only building on the\r\ncampus, was blown almost to the south end of Third Street. Agitation\r\nwas begun to bring the remainder of the building to join the roof,\r\nbut State officials refused to consider the plan, chiefly because the\r\nproperty originally used was school land. Old Main was remodeled and a\r\nwomen's dormitory erected near it. That settled the controversy.\r\n\r\nFor students who were unable to live on the campus, transportation\r\nwas a troublesome problem. Only a country road of sticky Red River\r\nValley gumbo connected the campus with the city, and, except for the\r\nfortunate few who caught rides on horse-drawn vehicles, city students\r\nwalked to classes. During severe weather it was often necessary to flag\r\na freight or passenger train of the Great Northern to make the trip\r\nto town. About 1900 a trolley line was established to the university,\r\nand despite its erratic service it greatly facilitated attendance of\r\nnonresident students.\r\n\r\nAlthough given an endowment of 86,080 acres of public lands in 1889\r\nwhen it became the University of North Dakota, there were many years\r\nwhen the school derived no revenue from this source, but had to depend\r\nentirely upon legislative appropriation. In 1895 Governor Allin vetoed\r\nmost of the appropriation, leaving money for the janitor's salary but\r\nnone for the faculty. The institution was kept open through private\r\ncontributions, and President Webster Merrifield and other professors\r\nserved without salary during a trying two-year period. Despite\r\nfinancial difficulties, attendance at the university in its first 15\r\nyears increased more than 40 percent and in 1898 President Merrifield\r\nreported to the legislature that the facilities of the institution were\r\ninadequate. Continued expansion added law, premedical, and commerce\r\nschools, and mechanical, electrical, and mining engineering departments\r\nat the university by the end of the 1901 term.\r\n\r\nDuring the first six years of university history there were only two\r\nbuildings on the campus. The main building, later known as Merrifield\r\nHall, contained classrooms, book store, post office, and men's\r\ndormitory. The other building, later named Davis Hall for Hannah E.\r\nDavis, one of its early matrons, housed the girls' dormitory, and, in\r\nthe basement, the university dining hall. Alumni of those days relate\r\nthat the dining hall was a very popular place. When meals were ready\r\nto be served a napkin was hung out the basement window, and the first\r\nstudent in the main building who spied the sign, regardless of whether\r\nhe happened to be in a class or not, yelled, \"Rag's out!\" The shout\r\nwas taken up and a stampede to the dining room followed. This custom\r\nprevailed for several years. One day President Merrifield was showing\r\nsome of his Eastern friends through the institution when suddenly\r\n\"Rag's out\" reverberated through the halls. The visitors wondered if\r\nthere was a riot, and the mortified president realized for the first\r\ntime how the dinner call sounded to outsiders. He suppressed it with\r\ndifficulty, after many student debates on the sacredness of college\r\ntraditions.\r\n\r\nWith the advent of football teams, \"Odz, odz, dzi,\" an imitation of\r\na Sioux war cry, became the college yell, and has continued to the\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nWhen a delegation from the first North Dakota legislature visited\r\nthe campus on a tour of inspection in 1889, residents of the girls'\r\ndormitory held a tea in their honor. In order to improve upon the\r\nbarrenness of the sparsely furnished parlor, pieces were borrowed from\r\nthe girls' rooms and from friends. The expedient was more successful\r\nthan the girls had anticipated, for the legislators considered the\r\nfurnishings more than adequate and thereupon decreased the amount\r\nallowed in the budget for dormitory equipment.\r\n\r\nAlthough the University of North Dakota has been in existence only 55\r\nyears (1938), it has had its share of distinguished alumni, among whom\r\nis Maxwell Anderson (class of 1911), playwright, author of _What Price\r\nGlory_, _Mary of Scotland_, _Winterset_, and other dramas. In 1933 his\r\nplay _Both Your Houses_ was awarded the Pulitzer Prize.\r\n\r\nVilhjalmur Stefansson, explorer, attended the university from 1899 to\r\n1902, and left at the request of the faculty. His escapades, though\r\ndoubtless improved upon with the years, are quite typical of him. It is\r\nsaid he attended classes as seldom as possible, yet always received the\r\nhighest grades. The story goes that he went to his calculus class only\r\non the first day of the term, then returned for the final examination,\r\nwhich the professor allowed him to write, with gloomy prophecies of his\r\nruin. Stefansson's mark was 98. The professor could not help remarking\r\nthat he had done well considering that he had attended only one class.\r\n\"And,\" retorted Stefansson, \"if I hadn't come here the first day I'd\r\nhave got one hundred.\"\r\n\r\nThe Arctic explorer has been credited with pranks such as releasing a\r\nsmall pig on the speaker's platform at convocation, and rolling a keg\r\nof beer across the campus to win a bet when North Dakota was a very dry\r\nState. There was then no trolley from Grand Forks to the campus, and\r\nPresident Merrifield was driven the two miles to and from town in his\r\nprivate carriage. One day Stefansson saw the carriage parked downtown.\r\nThe driver was old in service, and when Stefansson stepped into the\r\ncarriage and said \"Home, Peter\" in a good imitation of the president's\r\nvoice, Peter suspected nothing. Stefansson rode in comfort to the\r\ncampus, while President Merrifield, it is said, walked. Expelled in\r\n1902, Stefansson was called back to his Alma Mater in 1930 to have the\r\nLL. D. degree conferred on him in recognition of his contributions to\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nThe east campus road passes the LAW BUILDING, WOODWORTH HALL, CHEMISTRY\r\nBUILDING, and BABCOCK HALL. In Woodworth, the school of education, is\r\nthe campus broadcasting studio. The University of North Dakota was\r\nthe second university in the United States to offer courses in radio\r\nadministration, and engineering students use the KFJM transmitter,\r\nadjacent to the campus, for practical class work in technical radio\r\ninstruction. Just S. of the Chemistry Building are the university\r\ntennis courts, and a nine-hole golf course is E. of MEMORIAL STADIUM\r\n(L) erected in 1927. The university athletic department is a member\r\nof the North Central Conference and books games with schools from\r\ncoast to coast. The UNIVERSITY MUSEUM on the top floor of Babcock Hall\r\n(_open 9-5 daily_) contains a large collection of Indian artifacts and\r\ngeological and historical items.\r\n\r\nThe road curves back of Babcock and the COMMONS past CAMP DEPRESSION\r\n(L), established in 1933, where railroad cabooses are fitted up for\r\nenterprising students to provide cooperative accommodations at a\r\nminimum cost. Left of Camp Depression is the shiny arched steel WINTER\r\nSPORTS BUILDING. Around the curve is the ARMORY (L) where athletic and\r\nsocial events and weekly convocations are held. The road to the R.\r\npasses BUDGE HALL (R), men's dormitory, built in 1889; OLD MERRIFIELD\r\nHALL (L), generally known as \"Old Main,\" the first building on the\r\ncampus and now occupied by administrative offices, post office, book\r\nstore, and offices of the extension division; NEW MERRIFIELD HALL (L),\r\nthe liberal arts college building, completed in 1929; SCIENCE HALL (R),\r\nhousing the medical school and State Public Health Laboratories; and\r\nthe LIBRARY (L), containing 77,000 catalogued books and periodicals and\r\nabout 17,500 uncatalogued Government documents.\r\n\r\nCurving L., the road passes the PRESIDENT'S HOUSE (R), a spacious\r\nGeorgian Colonial brick residence. Next is MACNIE HALL, a cooperative\r\nmen's residence hall, named for John Macnie, for 20 years a member of\r\nthe faculty, and composer of the university _Alma Mater_. Vine-covered\r\nCHANDLER HALL (R), named for Elwin Chandler, dean emeritus of the\r\nschool of engineering, is headquarters during Engineers' Day held the\r\nlast Friday in April each year. DAVIS HALL (R), women's dormitory, is\r\nthe second oldest building on the campus, erected in 1887. It houses\r\nthe home economics department.\r\n\r\nENGLISH COULEE (R), so-called because an Englishman is said to have\r\ndrowned in it, borders the campus on the W. Between Davis Hall and the\r\nWOMEN'S GYMNASIUM the stream curves, creating the impression that the\r\nopposite bank is a wooded island. This far bank is the stage of the\r\nBANKSIDE THEATER, and the concave bank facing it is used to seat the\r\naudience. The theater is the scene of an Interfraternity Sing held the\r\nlast week in May.\r\n\r\nThe original Bankside Theater, about one block N. of the present\r\nsite, was dedicated in 1914 and is said to have been the first open\r\nair theater to make use of the natural curve of a stream to separate\r\nthe stage from the auditorium. The initial performance given here, _A\r\nPageant of the Northwest_, was written by students of the Sock and\r\nBuskin Society (now the Dakota Playmakers) under the direction of Prof.\r\nFrederick Koch, who is distinguished for his work in American folk\r\ndrama.\r\n\r\nThe banks of English Coulee have fostered both drama and romance.\r\nCollege sweethearts spend their evenings by this stream, admiring the\r\nreflection of the moon in the water. The custom is known locally as\r\n\"coulee-banking.\"\r\n\r\nThirteen social fraternities, including 11 national groups, are\r\nrepresented at the university, and there are 10 sororities, 9 of them\r\nnational. The houses along Fraternity Row on University Avenue and the\r\nother streets near the campus present the architecture of many nations\r\nand periods. A French chateau shouldering a stucco cottage, a graceful\r\nGeorgian Colonial residence standing between an English country house\r\nand an Italian mansion, and houses of Spanish and English design form a\r\nquaint architectural democracy that is, perhaps, a fitting background\r\nfor the social life of a student body representing various nations.\r\n\r\n12. WESLEY COLLEGE, N. of University Ave. opposite the University of\r\nNorth Dakota, is the first of the Methodist schools in the United\r\nStates designated by that name and the first church school to affiliate\r\nwith a State university. Its residence halls are open to students of\r\nall church affiliations, as are the classes in religion, music, and\r\nexpression. Work in any department of Wesley College is credited toward\r\nuniversity degrees.\r\n\r\nThe campus contains four buildings, Corwin, Larimore, Sayre, and\r\nRobertson Halls, constructed of white brick with trimmings of white\r\nglazed terra cotta in Grecian style. Robertson Hall, the newest\r\nbuilding, contains the administrative offices, school of religion,\r\nand expression department. This building, costing $40,000, was\r\nmade possible by the contribution of an alumnus, John M. Hancock,\r\nand his family of Hartsdale, N. Y., and was completely furnished by\r\nMrs. Hancock. Corwin Hall houses the well-equipped music department.\r\nLarimore Hall, the women's dormitory, is immediately behind Corwin,\r\nwhile the men's dormitory, Sayre Hall, adjoins Robertson Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS OF INTEREST IN ENVIRONS\r\n\r\n  North Dakota State Mill and Elevator, =1 m.=; Red River Oxcart\r\n  Trail, 1.5 m.; Northern Packing Plant, =1.5 m.=; Grand Forks Silver\r\n  Fox Farm, =4 m.= (_see Tour 1_).

Its name (pronounced MY-not) was given it\r\nto honor Henry D. Minot, young Eastern capitalist and college friend of\r\nTheodore Roosevelt. Situated in the deep valley of the Souris (Mouse)\r\nRiver, the town overflows the level mile-wide flood plain to thrust\r\nitself up the south slope of the valley onto the open prairie. Rough,\r\nwell worn block pavement in the business section evolves into smooth,\r\ntree-bowered asphalt avenues lined with fine homes in the residential\r\ndistricts. The twisting, sluggish river winds through the center of\r\nthe city, in some sections its banks scarred with piles of refuse, in\r\nothers rimmed by trim lawns.\r\n\r\nThe hills that rim the Souris at Minot are evidences of the mighty\r\nforce of the raging waters that during the glacial period poured from\r\nthe melting edge of the great Dakota ice sheet to plow deep valleys\r\nand lay the basis for the town's future prosperity. The products of\r\nthe geological past yield valuable returns. One, the rich, fertile bed\r\nof glacial Lake Souris, provides good crops. The other is lignite,\r\nthe soft brown peat-like coal that underlies much of the northwestern\r\nportion of the State, and for which Minot is an important shipping\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nJames J. Hill's Great Northern Railway was pushing west through Dakota\r\nTerritory in 1887 when it was found necessary to stop near here and\r\nbuild a bridge across a coulee. Where construction halted there\r\nimmediately sprang up a large tent town, which was generally assumed to\r\nbe the start of a permanent settlement. The railroad company, however,\r\nhad selected a town site to the east, on the Souris River, and when\r\nthis became known the exodus was sudden and complete; almost overnight\r\nthe tent town was transplanted to the new location. This mushroom-like\r\nappearance, coupled with an almost phenomenal growth to 5,000\r\npopulation during its first year, earned the new frontier settlement\r\nthe title of the Magic City.\r\n\r\nThe first white man to settle on the ground now incorporated into\r\nthe city of Minot was Erik Ramstad, who in May 1885 had come from\r\nGrafton, N. Dak., and settled by squatter's right on a quarter section\r\nbisected by the Souris. Late in the summer of 1886 he relinquished\r\n40 acres south of the river to the town site people, and this land\r\ntogether with another 40 acres to the south became the original site\r\nof Minot. On July 16, 1887, less than a year after settlement, Minot\r\nwas an incorporated city. A few weeks later an entire slate of city\r\nofficers was selected in a campaign which set a high standard for many\r\nheated city elections of later years. Principal interest centered\r\nabout the candidates for mayor, and with typical frontier camaraderie\r\nthe defeated man was the first to sign the bond of office for his\r\nvictorious opponent. At its initial meeting the newly elected city\r\ncouncil selected as the city's first police chief William Flumerfelt, a\r\nsaloon-keeper.\r\n\r\nWhen Minot's first Christmas arrived, in 1887, not a church graced the\r\ntown. To observe the season a Christmas tree was set up in Jack Doyle's\r\nsaloon, which stood on the site of the present Woolworth store at the\r\ncorner of Central Avenue and Main Street. Most of the town turned out\r\nfor the celebration, gifts were hung on the tree, and everyone was\r\ngiven candy.\r\n\r\nMany early residents were buried in a cemetery in southwest Minot,\r\nalthough no markers remain. This burial place on one occasion almost\r\nsaw the interment of a person who, by virtue of being very much alive,\r\nwas quite undeserving of inclusion here. It happened that a local\r\ncharacter known as Spider had gone to his reward, and \"the boys\" had\r\ntaken over his obsequies, stopping on the way to the cemetery to\r\nfortify themselves at a saloon. Reaching the grave, they attempted to\r\nlower the coffin, but one end dropped down and the other caught on the\r\nside of the grave. John J. Powers, a well-known rancher, was selected\r\nto straighten the coffin, but in getting down he was caught between it\r\nand the wall of the grave. Disregarding his protests, the high-spirited\r\npallbearers proceeded to shovel in dirt, and he was covered except for\r\nhis head and shoulders when passersby, hearing his cries, arrived on\r\nthe scene and effected a rescue.\r\n\r\nIt was events like this that earned Minot the name of a wild town; and,\r\nconsidering the type of people who flocked into the new city--transient\r\nrailroad workers and hangers-on, horse and cattle thieves who at that\r\ntime infested the west and northwest sections of the State, gamblers\r\nwho saw opportunity in the new settlement, and criminals who had\r\nescaped across the boundary from Canada--it is hardly remarkable that\r\nthe town soon had a reputation for lawlessness and iniquity. Many\r\npioneer residents of Minot still remember a certain railway passenger\r\nconductor who would call the name of the station, \"MINOT, this is\r\nM-I-N-O-T, end of the line. Prepare to meet your God!\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of the disreputable element, many dependable citizens selected\r\nthe boom town for their permanent homes, and to them the development of\r\nthe city has been due. As early as 1887 Marshall McClure was publishing\r\nthe first newspaper, the weekly Minot _Rustler-Tribune_. The city had\r\nits first wooden sidewalk in 1888, and the same year Main Street was\r\nlighted with kerosene lamps. The city council passed an ordinance\r\nagainst speeding with horses, the limit being set at eight miles per\r\nhour. Apparently the council of that day believed that actions speak\r\nlouder than words, for on one occasion it adjourned to go out in a body\r\nto grub stumps and fix a road that needed repair. In 1889 this same\r\nprogressive body voted that the city pay 50 cents per barrel for the\r\nfirst 10 barrels of water delivered at any fire in the city. The first\r\nfire wagon was John Strommen's dray, which was used to haul water every\r\ntime an alarm was turned in.\r\n\r\nBurlington (_see Tour 7_), the first community in the Souris region,\r\nhad confidently expected that the Great Northern would be routed past\r\nits door, but instead the road chose the Minot site. The Magic City\r\nthereupon set out to deprive its rival of the county seat as well.\r\nArrangements were made for the railroad company to sidetrack an old\r\nfreight car at Lonetree 28 miles west of Minot. Telegraph wires were\r\nstrung into it, and the roadmaster presented an affidavit to the county\r\ncommissioners stating that a station had been opened. Burlington\r\nprotested: Lonetree belonged in the Burlington precinct, it claimed,\r\nand there were not enough residents to open the polls. The railroad\r\ninstalled two operators, a station agent and a helper; Lonetree was\r\ndeclared a precinct, and it is said that railroad crews as far west as\r\nGlasgow, Mont., voted. Minot became the county seat.\r\n\r\nSettlers rushed into \"Imperial Ward\" County when it was surveyed and\r\nopened to homesteading in 1896. The origin of the county's nickname\r\nis apparent from the following description in Colonel Lounsberry's\r\n_Record_: \"... a small sized empire of 5,000 square miles rich in soil,\r\nclays, coal, and the energy of its people, immigration unequaled,\r\nsteady and firm like the flow of a river.\" Land entries at Minot during\r\nthe first nine months of 1905 were said to be greater than at any other\r\nU. S. land office in the country. Homesteaders slept on the floor of\r\nthe office to avoid losing their turn in filing for land.\r\n\r\nImperial Ward remained intact until 1910, when its ample acres were\r\ncarved into Renville, Burke, Mountrail, and present Ward Counties.\r\n\r\nDeer, antelope, prairie and timber wolves, foxes, mink, otter, beaver,\r\nducks, and geese provided early settlers of the Minot area with food,\r\nfurs, and sport. In the winter, when water holes were opened in the\r\nfrozen river for stock, fish would come up to the openings in such\r\nnumbers that they could easily be speared with pitchforks, and it was\r\nnot uncommon at these watering places to see fish frozen and stacked up\r\nlike cordwood.\r\n\r\nSince the Souris winds through Minot for a distance of eight miles,\r\nits overflow can cause great damage, and several times there have been\r\nsevere floods. The worst occurred in 1882, 1904, 1916, 1923, and 1927.\r\nThe 1904 flood took the town by surprise, as there were no telephones\r\nin the territory upstream from Minot by which the alarm could be given,\r\nand small houses were torn from their foundations as the crest of the\r\nflood hit the city. Railroad tracks were under water and traffic on the\r\nGreat Northern and Soo was at a standstill. The flood continued for\r\nabout three weeks, and children rejoiced as school was discontinued.\r\nPeople went about their business in boats, using their front porches\r\nfor piers. Many north side residents moved in with friends living on\r\nthe higher south side.\r\n\r\nIn recent years dikes have been built to keep the Souris within\r\nbounds, and Federal works on the river above the city, the subsistence\r\nhomestead project at Burlington, and the Upper Souris migratory\r\nwaterfowl project (_see Tour 7_) have constructed dams which enable\r\nengineers to control the flow of water.\r\n\r\nWhile the Great Northern was responsible for Minot's origin and early\r\ngrowth, several factors have shared in the city's later development.\r\nExtension of the railroad westward added to the trade territory, all\r\nof which is agricultural, and the city became the logical wholesale\r\ndistribution point for northwest North Dakota. The arrival of the\r\nSoo in 1893 tapped untouched areas southeast and northwest, again\r\nenlarging the trade region. The first bus line in the State began\r\noperation between Minot and Bismarck in 1922. Truck and bus lines\r\nnow radiate from Minot to serve the many outlying communities not on\r\nthe transcontinental railroads. The city is a center for an area of\r\n22,500 square miles, extending north to the Canadian line and west\r\ninto Montana. In 1930 Minot had the second largest volume of wholesale\r\nbusiness in the State, with transactions totaling $18,500,000.\r\n\r\nIts location in an extensive agricultural area has established Minot\r\nas a farm market. During both pre-war and post-war periods of heavy\r\ncrop yields and high prices, Minot boomed as a grain shipping point.\r\nTwo flour mills have been a factor in maintaining cash grain prices\r\nat higher levels than in other communities. Processing of dairy and\r\npoultry products has become an important industry, and a cash livestock\r\nmarket has brought additional returns and marketing facilities in the\r\npast few years. A plant of the poultry cooperative maintained by the\r\nNorth Dakota Farmers Union is situated in Minot. The recent droughts\r\nlessened grain marketing, but pushed forward in another direction the\r\nproduction and stability of diversified farm products, as indicated\r\nby the expansion of one and the erection of another creamery and\r\nprocessing plant.\r\n\r\nLike other cities, Minot has felt the depression period, but outwardly\r\nthere remains only one prominent scar--\"Sparrow Hotel,\" the steel\r\nskeleton of a 10-story hotel building. Begun in 1929, construction was\r\nhalted by the market crash of that year, and the framework now houses\r\nonly a multitude of twittering, chirping sparrows.\r\n\r\nIts rail facilities have helped to make Minot a natural shipping\r\npoint for the great quantities of lignite mined in this vicinity. The\r\nTruax-Traer Company, with headquarters here, is one of the largest\r\nlignite strip mining companies in the United States, and operates the\r\nthree largest strip mines in the State.\r\n\r\nOut of the _Rustler-Tribune_, which reported Minot's earliest events,\r\nthere grew the Minot _Optic Reporter_, which is now the Minot _Daily\r\nNews_. The _Democrat_, a political publication, has grown into the\r\n_Dakota State Journal_, and the weekly Ward County _Independent_ is\r\nalso published in Minot. A radio station, KLPM, maintains studios in\r\nthe Fair Block on South Main Street.\r\n\r\nWith improved transportation facilities and good roads, Minot has\r\nbecome a medical center for the northwest section of the State. Two\r\nlarge hospitals, two smaller private hospitals, and medical and dental\r\nclinics are maintained.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS OF INTEREST\r\n\r\n1. MINOT STATE TEACHERS COLLEGE, 9th Ave. NW. between 2nd and 8th Sts.,\r\nwith an average quarterly enrollment of 525, is the largest normal\r\nschool in the State. It is an accredited four-year college with a\r\nteachers training school in connection.\r\n\r\nIts 70-acre campus, 60 acres of which were donated by Erik Ramstad,\r\nMinot's first settler, lies at the foot of the hills bordering the\r\nSouris valley on the N. and contains six brick buildings of modern\r\nconstruction, including a main educational building with auditorium\r\nand gymnasium, two dormitories, two training school buildings, a\r\npowerhouse, and a floodlighted athletic field.\r\n\r\nThe college offers a two-year standard teachers course as prescribed by\r\nState law, a two-year junior college course, and a four-year curriculum\r\nleading to a B.A. degree in education. In the training school a model\r\nprimary, grade, and high school is maintained, enabling prospective\r\nteachers to secure actual experience in their profession. Many children\r\nin the northwest section of the city attend the college school.\r\n\r\n2. WARD COUNTY COURTHOUSE, 3rd St. SE. between 3rd and 4th Aves., was\r\ndedicated May 31, 1930. It is said to be the first North Dakota public\r\nbuilding of modern design. A motto inscribed upon the front elevation\r\nreads: \"Let Us Develop the Resources of Our Land, Call Forth Its Power,\r\nBuild Upon Its Institutions and Promote All Its Great Interests.\"\r\n\r\nThis austere spacious structure, designed by Tolz, King and Day\r\nof Minneapolis, and erected at a cost of $450,000; succeeded an\r\nold-fashioned brick courthouse built in 1891 and razed in 1928. The old\r\ncourthouse, built after Minot had won the county seat from Burlington,\r\nwas by no means adequate, but the commissioners feared to submit the\r\nquestion of a new courthouse to a vote, since the county as a whole\r\nwas not reconciled to Minot's county seat victory. As the law allowed\r\nrepairs without popular approval, the commissioners \"repaired\" the\r\n$8,000 courthouse to the extent of a new $25,000 addition.\r\n\r\n3. PUBLIC LIBRARY (_open 9-9, except July and Aug., 9-6_), 101-107 2nd\r\nAve. SE., is a buff brick Carnegie institution containing more than\r\n18,000 volumes.\r\n\r\n4. ROOSEVELT PARK (_swimming pool, playgrounds, picnic grounds,\r\nathletic field, tennis courts, tourist camp_), E. end of 4th Ave. SE.,\r\non the S. bank of the Souris River, is an 85-acre tract beautified\r\nby rustic bridges, lagoons, flower beds, and sunken gardens. A Zoo\r\ncontaining many species of foreign and domestic animals attracts\r\nthousands of visitors annually.\r\n\r\nIn the park is a bronze EQUESTRIAN STATUE OF THEODORE ROOSEVELT,\r\ndepicting him as a Rough Rider. The base of the statue is a\r\nreproduction of the Badlands formations along the Little Missouri River\r\nwhere Roosevelt once lived. This memorial, designed by A. Phimister\r\nProctor of New York and presented to the city in 1924 by Dr. Henry\r\nWaldo Coe, pioneer North Dakota physician and life-long friend of\r\nRoosevelt, is dedicated to the school children who contributed the cost\r\nof the base.\r\n\r\nCOE DRIVE, a scenic two-mile route through the woods bordering a loop\r\nof the Souris River, connects with a mile drive through Roosevelt Park.\r\nIt is reached by driving one block into the park from the entrance and\r\nturning right.\r\n\r\n5. OAK PARK, W. end of 3rd Ave. NW., has more than 50 acres of wooded\r\nland. Provided with tennis courts, wading pool, and picnic tables, it\r\nis a favorite spot for Sunday picnickers from the surrounding country.\r\n\r\n6. ROSEHILL CEMETERY, 3rd St. SE. at 11th Ave., contains the nine-foot\r\nmarble WORLD WAR MEMORIAL SHAFT and the DAUGHTERS OF UNION VETERANS OF\r\nTHE CIVIL WAR MEMORIAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS OF INTEREST IN ENVIRONS\r\n\r\n  Burlington underground lignite mines, =8 m.=; Burlington\r\n  Subsistence Homestead Project, =8 m.=; Velva lignite strip mine,\r\n  =32 m.= (_see Tour 7_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAYGROUNDS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORT ABRAHAM LINCOLN STATE PARK\r\n\r\n\r\n  =Entrance:= 4.5 m. S. of Mandan on graveled road (_see Tour 8_).\r\n\r\n  =Points of interest in park:= Fort McKeen, Slant Indian Village,\r\n  site of old Fort Abraham Lincoln.\r\n\r\n  =Regulations:= Park open during daylight hours only; parking cars\r\n  on highway prohibited.\r\n\r\nThe 750 acres of Fort Abraham Lincoln State Park lie on the west bluffs\r\nof the Missouri River, encompassing three sites of historical and\r\narcheological interest--a Mandan Indian village and two old military\r\nposts. The park is being developed by the State Historical Society of\r\nNorth Dakota in cooperation with the National Park Service.\r\n\r\nAs the roadway enters the park, the bluffs rise steeply to the right,\r\nwhile below on the left is spread a beautiful view of the Missouri\r\nwinding away to the distant hills, tracing the outlines of Sibley\r\nIsland, the Heart River below, flowing into the Missouri, and Bismarck\r\nand the capitol set against the background of the valley rising on the\r\nother side of the river.\r\n\r\nFort McKeen is on the river bluffs, and the Indian village is below on\r\nthe river bank, slightly higher than Fort Abraham Lincoln, the cavalry\r\npost, on the broad ancient plain near the mouth of the Heart.\r\n\r\nLeft as the highway enters the park is a crude log palisade that guards\r\nthe old SLANT VILLAGE. Before these prairies saw the invasion of the\r\nwhite men, perhaps two centuries ago, a group of Mandan Indians,\r\nseeking a new location in their advance up the Missouri Valley,\r\nselected this narrow point of land which had such excellent natural\r\nprotection. On the east was the Heart River and on the south a deep\r\ncoulee. Along the exposed sides the Indians built a palisade and dug a\r\nmoat to secure their little town.\r\n\r\nDepressions in the earth show that the settlement contained 68 lodges.\r\nFive have been restored by the park administration, four of them\r\nhomes and the other the large ceremonial lodge. All have been placed\r\nas nearly as possible on their original sites, and in some cases the\r\nlocations made by park workers were so accurate that remains of the\r\nold lodges were found in excavating for the restoration work. The five\r\nlodges have been carefully reproduced in every detail. (A general\r\ndescription of the construction and equipment of the typical Indian\r\nearth lodge will be found under INDIANS AND THEIR PREDECESSORS.)\r\n\r\nCrude tools such as the inhabitants of this town used in domestic and\r\nagricultural work are on display in one lodge. Hoes and shovels were\r\nflat bones fastened to wooden handles, and brooms were bunches of brush\r\nbound together. A short post with a hollowed center served as a mortar,\r\na club about the size of a baseball bat as a pestle, and with this\r\napparatus corn was ground for meal.\r\n\r\nFurnishings in the lodge include the horse corrals, beds, and altars\r\nwhich were part of the domestic scene. There are specimens of dog and\r\nhorse travois, and an Indian bullboat, made by stretching a green\r\nbuffalo hide over a wooden frame and drying it. The result resembled\r\nnothing so much as an ungainly washtub, but the awkward-looking craft\r\nwould carry two or three persons quite safely across the treacherous\r\ncurrents of the Missouri.\r\n\r\nThe ceremonial lodge, with a diameter of 84 feet, has been restored\r\nin its original position in the center of the village court, and the\r\ninterior of this surprisingly large building furnishes an index of the\r\narchitectural advancement of these supposedly savage people. In this\r\nlodge tribal ceremonies were held, and the site doubtless witnessed\r\nmany enactments of the most holy Mandan religious service, in which\r\nthe young men of the tribe were inducted into manhood with bloody and\r\ngruesome torture rites.\r\n\r\nRight of the highway, almost opposite the entrance to the village,\r\nthe restored and graveled military road branches steeply upward to\r\nwhere FORT McKEEN commands a far view of the plains and the twisting\r\nMissouri. Although Bismarck, the two bridges across the river, and\r\nmany other marks of settlement are now part of the scene, the entire\r\nview from this point was one wild, untouched, verdant picture when\r\nArmy engineers came from Fort Rice in 1872 in search of a location for\r\nan infantry post to protect the surveyors, engineers, and workmen who\r\nprepared the way for the gleaming intrusion of the Northern Pacific\r\nrails. This site was selected, as the Mandan 200 years before had\r\nselected the one below, for its natural protection. The fort was built\r\nin 1872, and was named for Col. Henry Boyd McKeen of the Eighty-first\r\nPennsylvania Volunteers, but on November 19, 1872, the name was\r\nofficially changed to Fort Abraham Lincoln in honor of the martyred\r\nPresident. A triangular area was fortified, with a blockhouse at each\r\ncorner and palisade walls connecting them on two sides. The steep face\r\nof the bluff protected the remaining side. Within the stockade were\r\nofficers' quarters, barracks, kitchens, hospital, and laundry. The\r\nscouts' headquarters and the laundry were built of cottonwood logs cut\r\nalong the river, while most of the other buildings were of lumber.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers stationed at the fort led a varied life, the monotony of\r\nfrontier existence being tempered by fighting the Sioux, maintaining\r\norder among the lawless element which followed the progress of the\r\nrailroad, and even building smudges to protect the workers from the\r\ntormenting swarms of bloodthirsty mosquitoes.\r\n\r\nThe three blockhouses and the palisade have been restored, so that the\r\nfort looks much as it must have looked more than 50 years ago when it\r\ncrowned this bluff, guarding its prominent position on the river. None\r\nof the buildings within the enclosure is left, but the sites of all are\r\nmarked.\r\n\r\nTo avoid confusion, the restored fort is commonly referred to as Fort\r\nMcKeen, distinguishing it from the later Fort Abraham Lincoln, although\r\nthe latter included both posts. The FORT ABRAHAM LINCOLN SITE is right\r\nof the park road just south of the Indian village. Markers indicate the\r\nsites of the various structures, and holes partly filled with debris\r\nalso show where the buildings of the Northwest's strongest fortress\r\nonce stood. A row of cottonwoods, which grew along Officers' Row,\r\nstands in lonesome splendor.\r\n\r\nWhen Gen. George A. Custer and his spirited Seventh Cavalry came to\r\nFort Abraham Lincoln in 1873 it became a nine-company cavalry and\r\ninfantry post, with the cavalry established on the level plain below,\r\nwhere a good drill and parade ground was available. Custer, with his\r\nlong sandy-colored hair and restless vivacity, was one of the most\r\npersonable and interesting military men of his time. He and his wife,\r\na young and talented woman, soon drew about themselves a social circle\r\nthat was widely known and aspired to. Balls, musicales, and other\r\nentertainments drew people from the surrounding territory, including\r\nthe new town of Bismarck across the river. The social life at Fort\r\nAbraham Lincoln would have been a credit to any city, as, beneath\r\ncrystal chandeliers, to the music of the Seventh's band, stately\r\ncouples moved in the graceful figures of the dance.\r\n\r\nFor the soldiers, life consisted chiefly of maintaining order among the\r\nIndians and the incoming white population. At one time the guardhouse\r\nat the fort had a distinguished occupant, Rain-in-the-Face, the Sioux\r\nwarrior. He had been heard boasting of \"counting coup\" on the bodies\r\nof two white men killed on the Stanley expedition in 1873, and Tom\r\nCuster, brother of General Custer, was sent to take him into custody\r\nat Standing Rock Agency (_see Side Tour 8C_). Rain-in-the-Face was\r\narrested and imprisoned at Fort Abraham Lincoln, but escaped in a\r\njailbreak engineered by friends of some of the other prisoners, and\r\njoined Sitting Bull.\r\n\r\nLife at the post often grew monotonous for the troopers, who in winter\r\nfound their activities hampered by the severe cold, and in the summer\r\nsuffered from the torments of the heat and the mosquitoes.\r\n\r\nWhen the routine of military life palled too greatly on the soldiers,\r\nthey took refuge in the activities of the Point, a little settlement\r\nof dance halls, saloons, and similar places of entertainment, that\r\nflourished on the opposite bank of the river directly across from the\r\nfort. Since there was no bridge across the Missouri the Point could\r\nbe reached only by ferry or on the ice. At the time of the spring\r\nbreak-up, however, even the ferry could not be used, and many of the\r\nsoldiers missed the customary recreational and liquid facilities\r\nafforded by the Point. One spring, as the ice was going out, a young\r\nman, whose fine physique was equalled only by his foolhardy daring,\r\noffered to cross the river for some liquor. Crossing a river on\r\nbreaking ice has been known as a daring feat since even before the\r\ndays of Eliza and the bloodhounds, but crossing the Missouri is a\r\nparticularly hazardous exploit, for this river, always maliciously\r\nmenacing, is even more so in the spring, with great ice blocks eddying\r\nand whirling, crunching violently together, then flung apart by the\r\nswift current. The slightest misstep or miscalculation meant death to\r\nthe young, thirsty soldier, but with the greatest nonchalance he made\r\nthe crossing and the return, bringing his precious burden back with\r\nhim, and great and twofold was the rejoicing when he safely reached the\r\nhome shore.\r\n\r\nThree years of existence left Fort Abraham Lincoln in comparative\r\nquiet, with only an occasional Indian skirmish. Then events on the\r\nfrontier conspired to bring the Indian troubles to an end. The campaign\r\nof the Little Big Horn was planned (_see_ HISTORY). One day in 1876 the\r\nSeventh, with bands playing and colors flying, marched away along the\r\nHeart in pursuit of the Sioux. On a stifling night early in July the\r\nresidents of Bismarck were awakened from their sleep by loud sounds\r\nof shouting, of wagons and horses moving, at the river. Capt. Grant\r\nMarsh had arrived from the Little Big Horn with his steamer, the _Far\r\nWest_, loaded with the wounded of Major Reno's command, survivors of\r\nthe Battle of the Little Big Horn. But more than the wounded, he bore\r\nnews--news of the death of 267 men, of the annihilation of Custer and\r\nhis immediate command. Twenty-six of the waiting wives at Fort Abraham\r\nLincoln were widows.\r\n\r\nThe only living thing left of Custer's command was Comanche, Capt.\r\nMyles Keogh's horse. Through the rough country filled with hostile,\r\nvictorious Sioux, Reno's wounded men had been carried to the _Far\r\nWest_, and Captain Marsh had made his epic 54-hour run to Bismarck and\r\nthe fort 700 miles away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A RED\r\n  RIVER VALLEY\r\n  WHEATFIELD]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  OATS]\r\n\r\nCaptain Marsh's story of how he learned of the Custer tragedy is\r\nstrange, and almost unreal. He related later that, as he waited on\r\nthe river for word from the military commanders, a Crow Indian peered\r\nfrom the brush along the shore and signed that he wished to board the\r\nboat. On deck the Indian, unable to speak a word of English, squatted\r\nand began to make signs. He drew a group of dots, designated them with\r\nthe Crow word for \"white men.\" Then he showed a circle of dots around\r\nthe white men, and for them spoke the word for \"Sioux.\" And then, with\r\na sweep of his hand, he wiped out the inner group of dots. In this\r\nsimple, abrupt manner, Marsh related, the tragedy was first told to the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe story of Custer's annihilation was put on the telegraph wires by\r\nCol. C. A. Lounsberry. James W. Foley, North Dakota poet laureate, has\r\ncommented: \"It was, for stark tragedy, horror and surprise, perhaps the\r\ngreatest news story ever flashed over a telegraph wire to a stunned and\r\nstricken country, in the history of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThe Little Big Horn disaster was the beginning of the end of the era\r\nof Indian fighting in this region, and troops were withdrawn from Fort\r\nAbraham Lincoln in 1891, after which the buildings were carried off\r\npiecemeal by the settlers in the vicinity. A new infantry post, known\r\nas Fort Lincoln, was later established across the river (_see Tour 8_).\r\n\r\nFort Abraham Lincoln State Park is being developed for recreational and\r\nhistorical purposes by the Federal Government in cooperation with the\r\nState historical society. The grounds are being landscaped, foot trails\r\nlaid out, and picnic shelters built. Under construction between the\r\nIndian village and the Fort Lincoln site is a museum which will house\r\nsome archeological material being unearthed on the sites of the old\r\nearth lodges and historical material dealing with Fort McKeen and Fort\r\nAbraham Lincoln.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROOSEVELT REGIONAL STATE PARKS\r\n\r\n\r\n  =Season:= Open year round.

On both sides of a\r\n  sinuous river rise ten thousand buttes cut into bizarre shapes by\r\n  the waters of countless centuries. The hand of man never dared to\r\n  paint anything as those hills are painted. Olive and lavender,\r\n  buff, brown, and dazzling white mingle with emerald and flaming\r\n  scarlet to make a piece of savage splendor that is not without an\r\n  element of the terrible. The buttes are stark and bare. Only in\r\n  the clefts are ancient cedars, starved and deformed. In spring\r\n  there are patches of green grass, an acre here, a hundred acres\r\n  there, reaching up the slopes from the level bottom-land; but there\r\n  are regions where for miles and miles no green thing grows, and\r\n  all creation seems a witch's caldron of gray bubbles tongued with\r\n  flame, held by some bit of black art forever in suspension.\"\r\n\r\nHere in this broken country, known as the Badlands of the Little\r\nMissouri, the Roosevelt Regional State Parks are being developed to\r\npreserve parts of the strange area as scenic and recreational centers,\r\nand at the same time to establish a memorial to the former President,\r\nwho as a young man spent part of each year from 1883 to 1886 ranching\r\nhere. (_See Tours 8 and 10._) To view the freakish, tumbled, unearthly\r\nvalley is to appreciate and at the same time be amused by Gen. Alfred\r\nSully's oft-quoted characterization of the region as \"hell with the\r\nfires out.\" It must be remembered that the general received his\r\nimpressions as he jolted along in a wagon, sick, while his troops\r\nfought Sioux through the confused, uncertain terrain all one hot day\r\nin August 1864. Others visiting it under more favorable circumstances,\r\nespecially during the freshness of spring, concede the unparalleled\r\nfantasy of the landscape, and agree on its strange, wild, potent\r\nbeauty. Twenty years after Sully fought the Sioux here Roosevelt wrote,\r\n\"I grow very fond of this place ... it ... has a desolate, grim beauty,\r\nthat has a curious fascination for me.\" Since then many noted travelers\r\nand writers have marveled at its beauties and deplored the fact that\r\nits attractions have not been made more widely known.\r\n\r\nThe traveler approaching the Badlands from the rolling prairies on\r\neither side suddenly finds himself overlooking a valley cut abruptly\r\ninto the heart of the plain, a valley filled with a strange welter of\r\nbare ridges and hillocks, buttes and domes, pyramids and cones, forming\r\none of the most extraordinary topographies on the surface of the earth.\r\nIn broad horizontal stripes across the varied shapes of the buttes are\r\nthe browns, reds, grays, and yellows of the sand and clay laid down\r\ncenturies ago when during successive ages arms of the sea covered large\r\nparts of the North American Continent. Where today the visitor stands\r\nand looks out over the naked buttes once lay a mighty sea in which\r\nswam monsters whose fossilized skeletons are embedded in the strata\r\nlaid down by the primordial waters.\r\n\r\nHere and there, standing out against the lighter coloring of the sands\r\nand clays, are black veins of lignite. Ages ago dense forests, rivaling\r\nthose of the tropics of today, rose over the swamps of the receding\r\nseas. The motorcar speeds through a region where the giant hog, the\r\nthree-toed horse, and the saber-toothed tiger roamed among lofty trees.\r\nThe cast-off growth of the forest fell into the swamps below, where,\r\nshut away from the air by water and mud, it turned into peat. Centuries\r\nlater the seas returned to crush it with heavy layers of shale and\r\nclay, until pressure and heat drove out most of the volatile oils of\r\nthe wood, leaving carbon or coal. It is not surprising to find that\r\nlignite coal has the same cellular formation as wood, and that it at\r\ntimes bears the imprint of leaves or of whole trunks of trees. The\r\nforms of stumps 15 feet in diameter have been found in the coal beds of\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nLighting up the dull strata of the buttes are the ever present\r\npinks and reds of scoria--clay burnt into a brick-like shale by the\r\ncenturies-old fires of burning coal veins. Some of these burning\r\nveins still exist in the Badlands, being more easily discoverable in\r\nthe wintertime, when the heat from combustion causes steam to rise.\r\nThis burning has been one of the major factors in the production of\r\nthe present Badlands topography, for as the fires have eaten into the\r\ncoal veins in the cliffs, the earth has crumbled and been carried away\r\nby the rains and streams. These fires were an awesome sight to the\r\nIndians, who believed the hills were on fire.\r\n\r\nThe chief agent, however, in the formation of the Badlands has been\r\nthe Little Missouri River, which centuries ago began to carve its way\r\ndown through the soft shales and sandstones with which the early seas\r\nhad covered the area. Aided by the eroding action of wind, frost, and\r\nrain, by huge landslides, and by burning coal veins, the once swift,\r\nalways silt-laden river and its tributaries have floated away all the\r\nage-old clays of the region except these buttes and domes piled in\r\nindescribable confusion along the valley floor. The Indians, called the\r\nvalley \"The-place-where-the-hills-look-at-each-other,\" and the first\r\nwhite explorers, impeded in their travel, named it \"bad lands to travel\r\nthrough,\" a phrase inevitably shortened to Badlands.\r\n\r\nAdding to the bizarre coloring of this unusual valley are the blue-gray\r\nand silver of the sage, so often remarked by Roosevelt, the light green\r\nof the sparse grasses of butte top and valley, and the darker green\r\nof the cedars which cling to the shady sides of buttes. Cottonwood,\r\nash, box elder, elm, bull pine, dogwood, and flowering currant grow\r\nalong the Little Missouri, while gooseberries, buffalo berries, and\r\nchokecherries ripen in the gullies. In June the large, white, open\r\nflowers of the low-growing gumbo lily, also known as the cowboy lily\r\nand the butte primrose, appear in the otherwise barren soil at the foot\r\nof the buttes, to be followed shortly by the purple-centered white\r\nand lavender Mariposa and creamy white yucca lilies. In midsummer the\r\nsmall, wine-colored flowers of the ball cactus and the large, waxy,\r\nlemon-yellow and brown blossoms of the prickly pear cactus show on the\r\ndrier soil of the buttes, and the scoria lily, with its thistle-like\r\nfoliage, opens its large, white flower only after sundown. In addition\r\nto these striking, gaudy blooms, a great variety of more common North\r\nDakota flowers also appear in the valley of the Little Missouri,\r\nespecially in the springtime.\r\n\r\nWhen white men first visited the region, it was rich in wild life.\r\nBeaver and otter swam the streams, flocks of game birds hid in the\r\nbreaks, droves of elk, deer, and antelope fed along the Little\r\nMissouri, and huge herds of buffalo often darkened the prairie above\r\nthe valley. In Roosevelt's ranching days game was still abundant, and\r\ngrizzlies and mountain lions were encountered occasionally. Rocky\r\nMountain, or bighorn, sheep were killed as late as 1906. Bobcats and\r\ncoyotes are found occasionally even today. The valley harbors more than\r\n300 species of birds, including many game birds and the golden eagle.\r\n\r\nOn patches of dry grassland here and there, down in the bottoms or\r\nup on the buttes, there are prairie-dog towns--areas sometimes as\r\nmuch as a hundred acres in extent, thickly dotted with the small\r\nmounds of their cunning inhabitants. Prairie dogs, somewhat larger\r\nthan good-sized rats, are burrowing rodents allied to the marmot. In\r\ndigging their burrows they throw the earth up into little mounds, upon\r\nwhich, whenever anything has aroused their curiosity or fear, they sit\r\nto chatter, barking like very small dogs, or perhaps more like gray\r\nsquirrels.\r\n\r\nInteresting in connection with any description of the origin of the\r\nBadlands is the Sioux legend of their formation. Unknown centuries\r\nago, it is said, the Badlands were a fertile plain, covered with rich\r\ngrasses and abounding with game. Every autumn the plains tribes came\r\nhere to get meat for winter and to hold friendly councils beneath the\r\ntrees which grew along the rivers. Tribes, hostile at other times and\r\nin other places, while here greeted each other in peace.\r\n\r\nThis happy arrangement continued for many years, but one season a\r\nfierce tribe came from the mountains to the west and drove the plains\r\ntribes from their hunting grounds. Being unsuccessful in their attempts\r\nto dislodge the invaders, the plains people finally called a great\r\ncouncil and fasted and prayed. Many days passed, however, and no answer\r\ncame from the Great Spirit, and they began to despair.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly a great shudder convulsed the earth, the sky grew black\r\nas midnight, and lightning burned jagged through the gloom. Fires\r\nhissed from the earth and the once pleasant land rolled and tossed like\r\nthe waves of the sea, while into its flaming, pitching surface sank the\r\ninvading tribe, the streams, the trees, and all living things. Then\r\njust as suddenly as it had begun, the upheaval and the conflagration\r\nceased, leaving the plain fixed in grotesque waves.\r\n\r\nIn this way the Great Spirit destroyed the prize that had stirred up\r\nstrife among his children, and the Badlands were created.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTH ROOSEVELT REGIONAL STATE PARK TOUR\r\n\r\nEast entrance (_see Tour 4_)--Sperati Point (_see Tour 10_), 14 m.\r\n\r\nThe North Roosevelt Regional State Park, which has an area of\r\napproximately 40 square miles, presents many of the best Badlands\r\nfeatures, including a petrified forest and the remarkable views of the\r\nGrand Canyon of the Little Missouri River from Sperati Point.\r\n\r\nFrom the eastern entrance the winding graveled and scoria park highway\r\nproceeds in a general westerly direction along the northern side of the\r\nLITTLE MISSOURI.\r\n\r\nJust inside the entrance are the blue-gray buildings of the permanent\r\nCCC CAMP (L), which houses the 200 men assigned to putting trails\r\nthrough the area and building rustic equipment at the picnic and\r\ncamping areas in the park.\r\n\r\nAt =1.5 m.= is the CHALONER CREEK HORSE TRAIL.\r\n\r\nRight on this trail which affords an opportunity for a ride of =5\r\nm.= among the buttes and along the edge of the higher land above the\r\nbrush-filled gullies or breaks. Some parts of the trail are cut through\r\ngroves of aspen, ash, elm, and cedar on the north side of buttes, while\r\nother parts move over the face of the cliffs or on high and narrow\r\nridges with precipitous canyon walls 300 ft. or more in depth dropping\r\non either side. Petrified stumps are along the trail.\r\n\r\nThe highway, continuing W. more directly than the river, which here\r\nmakes a deep bend to the S., skirts patches of woodland along the\r\nbottoms to reach SQUAW CREEK PICNIC AREA, =5 m.=, the best-developed\r\ncamping center in the two parks. This picnic area on the banks of the\r\nLittle Missouri has excellent grass and shade. Its one-way road leads\r\namong aspen, aromatic sumac, oak, poplar, and cottonwood to a number\r\nof individual camp sites. In addition to a stone and log shelter and\r\nnumerous fireplaces, the area has 4 wells and 45 tables. At the east\r\nedge of the area a rustic footbridge leads over a little ravine, to\r\nclean, grassy picnic grounds.\r\n\r\nNorthwest of Squaw Creek Picnic Area the road passes along the edge of\r\nthe breaks overlooking the river to a junction with CEDAR CANYON HORSE\r\nTRAIL at =5.8 m.=\r\n\r\nLeft on this 5-mile trail, which is very similar in character to the\r\nChaloner Creek Horse Trail, are lookout points affording excellent\r\nviews. In spring portions of the trail show a profusion of wild flowers.\r\n\r\nThe highway proceeds NW. to the junction with a graded road.\r\n\r\nRight at this junction on a road disclosing very good views; it leads\r\nNW. along the west side of dry SQUAW CREEK to the northern boundary of\r\nthe park, =6 m.= Beyond lies ARNEGARD, =20 m.= (_see Tour 4_), by which\r\nthe Badlands and the park can be entered from the N.\r\n\r\nAt =7 m.= is CEDAR CANYON LOOKOUT, which commands an exceptionally good\r\nview to the S. across the Little Missouri River and beyond, where as\r\nfar as the eye can reach stretch the tumbled outlines of the buttes.\r\n\r\nNorthwest of Cedar Canyon the road moves out upon the plateau above the\r\nBadlands and then turns W. and SW. in a large arc along the edge of\r\nthe breaks to SPERATI POINT, =14 m.= (_see Tour 10_), a high shoulder\r\nof the plateau, overlooking the spectacular GRAND CANYON OF THE LITTLE\r\nMISSOURI. Lying just W. of the bend of the Little Missouri where it\r\nturns E. toward the Missouri, the point affords views up and down the\r\ncanyon, which in places is 600 ft. deep. It is proposed to make this a\r\ncompletely developed recreational center, with cabins, stables, lodge,\r\nand a store.\r\n\r\nFrom Sperati Point an unmarked and indefinite trail, which should not\r\nbe tried without a guide, leads SW.\r\n\r\nLeft on this trail to a PETRIFIED FOREST, =2 m.=, one of those Badlands\r\nareas, often many acres in extent, which abound with petrified logs\r\nand stumps. Petrified stumps are a common sight throughout the valley\r\nof the Little Missouri, suggesting that at one time it must have\r\nbeen heavily forested. When the originals of these stone trees died,\r\ntheir trunks, either standing or fallen, soaked up soil water holding\r\nmineral matter in solution. As the water evaporated, the mineral matter\r\nwas left behind, filling the pores of the wood and the tiny cavities\r\nproduced by decomposition. In time decay removed all the wood and\r\nthe trees became stone, or, popularly, petrified wood. Some of the\r\nlogs--for, of course, the trees are not now standing--are as much as 35\r\nft. in length and 2 ft. in diameter. In some places the soil has been\r\nwashed and blown away from beneath the stumps, leaving odd formations\r\nshaped like toadstools.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTH ROOSEVELT REGIONAL STATE PARK TOUR\r\n\r\nEast entrance (_see Tour 8_)--Hell's Hole--West entrance (_see Tour\r\n8_), 10 m.\r\n\r\nThe South Roosevelt Regional State Park comprises an area of\r\napproximately 90 square miles, lying along the Little Missouri just N.\r\nof US 10. In addition to the fantastic beauty of the Badlands buttes,\r\nit contains a petrified forest, and one of the largest burning coal\r\nmines in the Badlands.\r\n\r\nFrom the eastern entrance the route leads NW. over the broad, pale-pink\r\nribbon of the graveled and scoria park highway.\r\n\r\nHELL'S HOLE (L), =4 m.=, was named for a burning coal mine once\r\nsituated in this valley. The mine burned out, causing the earth to\r\ncrumble and destroy a tiny lake which lay under the cliff.\r\n\r\nAt =7 m.= three trails form a triangle on a level area adjacent to the\r\nLITTLE MISSOURI RIVER. Here it is proposed to develop a recreational\r\ncenter with full tourist accommodations, including cabins, store,\r\nlodge, and stables. At the north end of the proposed area is the\r\nold PEACEFUL VALLEY RANCH, which served tourists many years. It has\r\nbeen acquired by the park, and the ranch house and corrals are to be\r\npreserved as a recreational center. At Peaceful Valley Ranch are the\r\njunctions with an unimproved trail, a graveled truck trail, and an\r\nunmarked and indefinite horse trail.\r\n\r\n1. Right from the ranch on the unimproved trail to PADDOCK CREEK, =0.4\r\nm.=, which like all the creeks here is dry except in rainy seasons. Up\r\nthe creek, one on the L. bank at =1 m.= and the other on the R. at =1.5\r\nm.= are the mounds of two PRAIRIE-DOG TOWNS.\r\n\r\n2. Right from the ranch on the truck trail which crosses JONES CREEK,\r\n=0.8 m.=, and turns E. just before reaching CATHEDRAL BUTTE, =2 m.=, an\r\nold landmark on the trail.\r\n\r\nLeft from Cathedral Butte =0.5 m.= on an unimproved trail to WIND\r\nCANYON, a narrow, deep valley leading down to a broad elbow of the\r\nLittle Missouri. Its name was suggested by the striking examples of\r\nerosion by winds, which, whipping at the buttes for centuries, have\r\nworn them into odd shapes. From Wind Canyon the trail passes NW. along\r\nthe river to SHELL BUTTE, =0.8 m.=, a high butte into which the river\r\nhas cut deeply, revealing large deposits of marine shells.\r\n\r\nEast of Cathedral Butte on the main side route following the truck\r\ntrail for about a mile and then NE. across JUEL CREEK, =3.3 m.=, to\r\nGOD'S GARDENS (R), =4.5 m.=, an unusually attractive stretch of butte\r\nand lowland, from which the road leads NW. across GOVERNMENT CREEK,\r\n=5.3 m.=, where to the R., one on either side of the creek, are two\r\nPRAIRIE-DOG TOWNS. At the crossing of Government Creek is the junction\r\nwith an unimproved trail (_do not follow without guide_).\r\n\r\nRight on this trail =3 m.= to a BURNING COAL MINE, which is one of the\r\nlargest in the Badlands. The burning of the coal causes cracks to form\r\nin the earth above the vein; one guide says he has brought water to a\r\nboil in 15 min. by placing it above one of these cracks. As the vein is\r\nconsumed, the earth crumbles and falls, and the rains carry it away to\r\nthe streams.\r\n\r\nAmid some of the finest Badlands scenery the truck trail continues in a\r\ngeneral northwesterly direction to the north boundary of the park, =10\r\nm.=\r\n\r\n3. Left from the ranch on the unmarked and indefinite horse trail to a\r\nPETRIFIED FOREST, =5.5 m.=, considered one of the best examples of a\r\npetrified forest (_see North Roosevelt Regional State Park Tour above_)\r\nin the Badlands. The trip to this forest, which makes a nice day's\r\nouting, requires a guide.\r\n\r\nSouthwest of Peaceful Valley Ranch, the route runs along the east bank\r\nof the winding, shallow Little Missouri to a CAMPING AREA (R), =8 m.=,\r\nsheltered by trees along the stream. It is furnished with tables,\r\nfireplaces, and wells, and several individual camping spaces have been\r\ndeveloped along the road that circles through it.\r\n\r\nAt =8.5 m.= the route fords the river--a passage which in times of\r\nhigh water cannot be effected by motorcars--and, turning SW. along the\r\nwestern bank, reaches a permanent CCC CAMP (L), =9 m.=, with its low,\r\ntrim, slate-blue buildings lying next the stream on a level piece of\r\nbottom land overshadowed by lofty buttes.\r\n\r\nAt =9.5 m.=, is a junction with a graveled road leading uphill away\r\nfrom the river.\r\n\r\nRight on this trail is a PICNIC SHELTER, =0.5 m.=, built over a spring\r\nand provided with a fireplace.\r\n\r\nRight from this shelter =5 m.= on a marked HORSE TRAIL, which winds\r\namong the buttes in a figure eight. At some points on the trail the\r\ntops of Square (Flat Top) and Sentinel Buttes (_see Tour 8_) are\r\nvisible far away to the SW. At the center of the figure eight, forming\r\na pleasant place for lunch, is a clump of trees with a spring flowing\r\ndown over little sandstone terraces.\r\n\r\nAt =9.8 m.= is the sandstone portal of the west entrance, beyond which\r\nis the junction with US 10 (_see Tour 8_), =10 m.=\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIGHWAYS AND TRAILS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOUR 1\r\n\r\n\r\n  (Winnipeg, Man., Can.)--Pembina--Grand\r\n  Forks--Fargo--Wahpeton--(Watertown, S.

Graveled roadbed\r\n  except about 31 m. bituminous-surfaced. Accommodations of all types\r\n  in principal towns.\r\n\r\nUS 81 crosses North Dakota along its eastern boundary from the Canadian\r\nto the South Dakota border, and passes through the rich low valley of\r\nthe Red River of the North, a wide level plain that was once the bed of\r\nthe great prehistoric Lake Agassiz. The route parallels the Red River\r\nto Wahpeton, and the Bois de Sioux River between that city and the\r\nSouth Dakota Line. Constantly in sight to the left of the road are the\r\nheavily wooded river banks, but except for crossing several timbered\r\ntributaries the route runs through almost unbelievably flat green\r\nfields, broken here and there by an occasional farmstead.\r\n\r\nDuring the early settlement of this region the Red River provided\r\ntransportation into the newly opened Northwest, and beside its course\r\nslow-moving trains of creaking oxcarts preceded the steamboat into\r\nthe new land. It was in the Red River Valley that the first white\r\nsettlements in the State were made. Here in the last quarter of the\r\nnineteenth century flourished the bonanza farms--those huge land tracts\r\nentirely devoted to the growing of wheat that earned for this valley\r\nthe title of \"the bread basket of the world.\" Today the Red River\r\nValley produces many other crops--potatoes, sugar beets, alfalfa--in\r\naddition to wheat. Its natural endowments of rich soil and good\r\nrainfall combine with the man-made facilities of transportation to\r\nconstitute the most prosperous section of North Dakota.\r\n\r\nUS 81 crosses the Canadian border =64.5 m.= S. of Winnipeg, Can.\r\n\r\nPEMBINA (Chippewa, _highbush cranberry_), =3 m.= (792 alt., 551 pop.),\r\nnamed for the berries that lend their flaming color to the nearby woods\r\nin autumn, is the cradle of North Dakota white settlement. Here, at\r\nthe confluence of the Red and Pembina Rivers, the earliest trading\r\nposts and the first white colony in the State were established. Charles\r\nChaboillez, representing the North West Co., built the first fur post\r\non North Dakota soil on the south bank of the Pembina River within the\r\npresent site of Pembina in 1797-98. Rudely constructed and of short\r\nduration, it had already disappeared when Alexander Henry, Jr., also\r\nof the North West Co., came up the Red River in 1800. The following\r\nyear he built a post on the north side of the Pembina, and in the same\r\nyear both the XY and the Hudson's Bay Co. opened posts at the mouth\r\nof the river. The three competing companies, with their free rum and\r\nunscrupulous trading, brought about a lawless social condition in\r\nthe new settlement. Drinking bouts and brawls were continuous as the\r\nIndians were plied with liquor by the conscienceless traders, who\r\nexcused their conduct on grounds of competition.\r\n\r\nIt was during this time that the first child of other than Indian blood\r\nwas born on North Dakota soil. The child was not white, but Negro, the\r\ndaughter of Pierre Bonza, Henry's personal servant. The first white\r\nchild in the State was born at Henry's post in 1807, the illegitimate\r\nson of the \"Orkney Lad\", a woman who had worked at the post for several\r\nyears in the guise of a man. Her imposture was not generally known\r\nuntil the birth of her child, after which a collection was taken up and\r\nshe and the child were sent back to her home in the Orkney Islands.\r\n\r\nDuring the middle of the nineteenth century Pembina was the rendezvous\r\nfor white and metis hunters, and the town was the starting point for\r\nthe great Pembina buffalo hunts (_see Side Tour 5A_).\r\n\r\nThe fur trade brought some white settlers to this area, but it was\r\nnot until 1812 that systematic colonization was attempted. In that\r\nyear William Douglas, Earl of Selkirk, brought a group of dispossessed\r\nScottish peasants to the Red River Valley to farm under an agreement\r\nwith the Hudson's Bay Co. Untrained for the rigors of frontier\r\nlife, and persecuted by the fur traders of the rival North West\r\nCo. who did not want settlers in their lucrative area, many of the\r\nSelkirk colonists moved to Canada in 1818 after establishment of the\r\ninternational boundary defined Pembina as United States soil. The next\r\n30 years saw a slow influx of settlers into the Red River Valley and\r\nby 1851 Pembina had become a fairly important river port. In that year\r\nNorman Kittson, a fur trader, was named postmaster, the first in North\r\nDakota; and Charles Cavileer, for whom the town and county of Cavalier\r\nwere later named (_see Tour 5_), was appointed collector of customs\r\nat Pembina. Cavileer became postmaster in 1852, and, as under his\r\ninfluence newcomers arrived to farm, the fur trade declined and there\r\ndeveloped the first permanent agricultural community in the State.\r\n\r\nPembina appears from a distance more like a grove of trees than a town.\r\nMost of its buildings are old, reflecting the rococo architecture of an\r\nearlier day.\r\n\r\nOn the Red River at the eastern end of Rolette St. is MASONIC PARK,\r\nwhere a marker commemorates the site of the first Masonic lodge in the\r\nState, organized at Pembina in 1863. Each year, both on July 1, which\r\nis Dominion Day (the Canadian holiday similar to the U. S. Independence\r\nDay) and on July 4, the flag of the United States and the Canadian\r\nUnion Jack fly together from the park flagpole, a practice illustrating\r\nthe neighborliness of the border States and Provinces. The Canadian\r\nflag is a gift of the Masonic Grand Lodge of Manitoba.\r\n\r\nThe highway crosses the Pembina River, which in dry seasons is likely\r\nto appear more like mud than water. Left on the highway is PEMBINA\r\nSTATE PARK (_good water, firewood, kitchens, and tables_), which\r\nincludes the site of the Chaboillez trading post.\r\n\r\nA bridge over the Red River connects Pembina with St. Vincent, Minn.,\r\nsituated on US 59 (_see Minn. Tour 17_).\r\n\r\nAt =4 m.= is the PEMBINA AIRPORT (R), airport of entry operated by the\r\nNorthwest Airlines. It is on part of the former military reservation\r\nof Fort Pembina, established in 1870. The reservation was turned over\r\nto the U. S. Department of the Interior in 1895 and sold at public\r\nauction. The fort was situated a mile and a half S. of the city of\r\nPembina on the Red River.\r\n\r\nJOLIETTE, =14.5 m.= (796 alt., 100 pop.), is a French-Canadian\r\ncommunity named for Joliette, Quebec.\r\n\r\nAt =16.4 m.= is the junction with ND 44, a graveled highway and an\r\nalternate route of shorter distance between Joliette and Manvel (_see\r\nbelow_).\r\n\r\nLeft on ND 44 is BOWESMONT, =8.6 m.= (794 alt., 125 pop.), named for\r\nWilliam Bowes, the first storekeeper. It lies on the level land just W.\r\nof the Red River, its treeless streets more like a western North Dakota\r\nprairie town than the usual Red River Valley village. The story is told\r\nthat Bowes won the opportunity to name the town in a game of cards.\r\nBowesmont was first built on the banks of the river, but settlers\r\nexperienced great hardships when the stream overflowed its banks each\r\nspring, and the buildings were moved.\r\n\r\nNear Bowesmont in the spring of 1860 occurred an event illustrative of\r\nthe hardships suffered by the missionaries to this region. The Rev.\r\nJoseph Goiffon, assistant at the Pembina Catholic Mission, returning\r\nfrom a trip to St. Paul, left his party behind in an effort to reach\r\nthe mission in time to conduct a certain Mass. A driving rain had been\r\nfalling and this suddenly turned to a swirling snowstorm. In a short\r\ntime the ground was covered with six or seven inches of snow, and the\r\ndriving wind made it impossible for him to continue. The blizzard did\r\nnot abate, and in two days his horse had died from exposure and his\r\nown legs had frozen so that he was unable to walk. For five days he\r\nremained on the prairie, living on the flesh of his horse, until the\r\nstorm subsided and a passer-by heard his feeble cries for help. It was\r\nfound necessary to amputate parts of both legs, but in spite of this he\r\nreturned to the Pembina mission, and was later transferred to St. Paul\r\nand Mendota, where he served until his death in 1910.\r\n\r\nDRAYTON, =18.5 m.= (800 alt., 509 pop.), first known as Hastings\r\nLanding, was given its present name by settlers who came west from\r\nDrayton, Ont., Canada. In contrast with its neighbor Bowesmont, Drayton\r\nis situated directly in the timber on the banks of the Red. Its 42-acre\r\ncity park is unusual in that it lies in another State, across the river\r\nin Minnesota. The bridge leading to the park is also unusual; it is a\r\ndrawbridge, built in 1911, when the high stage of the Red aroused hope\r\nof reviving steamboating. After the bridge had been completed the river\r\nstage fell, and has never risen, so that the draw has not been lifted\r\nsince it was built.\r\n\r\nDrayton is an active sports town, especially interested in curling, and\r\n10 teams compete in the large enclosed rink each winter.\r\n\r\nLeft on ND 44 to ACTON HALL, =29.5 m.=, a community building.\r\n\r\nOn ND 44 to the junction (R) with a graveled road, =36.5 m.= In a\r\ntriangle formed by the junction is a CRUCIFIX. On a base of natural\r\nboulders, in summer the clear, marble-like whiteness of the cross\r\nand canopied figure stands out in contrast with the green of the\r\nsurrounding countryside.\r\n\r\nAt =50 m.= is the junction with US 81 (_see below_).\r\n\r\nHAMILTON, =24.5 m.= (830 alt., 151 pop.), also a Canadian settlement,\r\nis named for Hamilton, Ont. The oldest State bank in North Dakota,\r\norganized in 1886, is operated here. The Pembina County Fair,\r\nestablished in 1894, is held here (_June or July_) each year. In\r\nHamilton is the junction with ND 5 (_see Tour 5_).\r\n\r\nIn GLASSTON, =31.5 m.= (843 alt., 70 pop.), named for Archibald Glass,\r\nfirst postmaster, and ST. THOMAS, =37 m.= (846 alt., 595 pop.), named\r\nfor St. Thomas, Ont., are the homes of many retired farmers. The latter\r\nis also a potato and sugar-beet shipping center.\r\n\r\nAUBURN, =46.5 m.= (848 alt., 50 pop.), was larger than its neighbor\r\nGRAFTON, =52.5 m.= (833 alt., 3,136 pop.), until the latter became\r\na railroad junction. Named by early settlers for Grafton County, N.\r\nH., Grafton is on the Park River in the center of a rich farming\r\narea. It was the first city in this part of the Northwest to maintain\r\na municipal light plant, and had the first public library in North\r\nDakota, established by a women's club in 1897. A SPANISH-AMERICAN\r\nWAR MEMORIAL, one of the few in the State, is on the Walsh County\r\nCourthouse grounds. On a hill W. of the town is the GRAFTON STATE\r\nSCHOOL for the feeble-minded. Opened in 1904, the institution in 1937\r\nhad 778 inmates and a faculty and staff of 110. The grounds, including\r\nthe school farm, cover 20 acres.\r\n\r\nLeft from Grafton on ND 17, a graveled highway, to the junction with ND\r\n18, =10 m.=\r\n\r\nRight on this highway =8.5 m.= is HOOPLE, (901 alt., 325 pop.), one\r\nof the largest primary potato-shipping points in the State. More than\r\na thousand carloads of Red River Valley potatoes are loaded here each\r\nyear. The town is named for Allen Hoople, an early settler. U. S.\r\nSenator Lynn J. Frazier, former Governor of the State (1917-1921),\r\nlives on a farm NE. of here.\r\n\r\nOn ND 17 is PARK RIVER, =16.5 m.= (1,000 alt., 1,131 pop.), on the PARK\r\nRIVER, probably named by early explorers for the buffalo parks along\r\nthe stream. The Indians had no weapons which were effective on buffalo\r\nat long range, so they constructed corrals of brush into which the\r\nanimals could be herded for killing. Whenever possible these corrals,\r\nwhich the first white explorers called buffalo parks, were built near\r\nthe bank of a river or edge of a hill so that the buffalo would charge\r\nover the edge and be killed or badly injured in the crushing fall. The\r\nWALSH COUNTY AGRICULTURAL AND TRAINING SCHOOL, secondary vocational\r\ninstitution, is located in the town. In Park River are offices of the\r\nSOUTH BRANCH PARK RIVER PROJECT of the Soil Conservation Service, which\r\nhas a demonstration area of 51,000 acres in central Walsh County on\r\nwhich contour farming and wind strip cropping are practiced. Sinclair\r\nLewis, the novelist, owns a farm 1 m. S. of Park River, which he has\r\nnever seen.\r\n\r\nWilliam Avery Rockefeller, father of John D. Rockefeller, the late oil\r\nmagnate, lived on a Park River farm for some time. In 1881 an elderly\r\nman who gave his name as Dr. William Levingston homesteaded on a\r\nquarter section of land just E. of the town, where he lived each summer\r\nfor 15 years. He later purchased an adjoining quarter, but the deed to\r\nthis land was in the name of Pierson W. Briggs, a son-in-law of William\r\nRockefeller and then purchasing agent for the Standard Oil Company. In\r\n1895 George W. Towle, former Park River banker, who transacted much of\r\nDr. Levingston's business, saw a picture of the senior Rockefeller in a\r\ncopy of _McClure's Magazine_, and recognized it as that of his former\r\nclient, Levingston. William A. Rockefeller was not a doctor, but sold\r\npatent medicines and acted as a cancer specialist.\r\n\r\nMINTO, =63 m.= (826 alt., 565 pop.), originally settled by Canadians\r\nand named for an Ontario town, is now a Czech and Polish settlement.\r\nThe Feast of St. Wenslaus, September 28, and Czechoslovakian\r\nIndependence Day, October 28, are occasions of festivity. Minto is\r\nsituated on the FOREST RIVER. There is a park by the stream S. of the\r\ntown (_swimming pool, recreational area, and campgrounds._)\r\n\r\nARDOCH, =69 m.= (830 alt., 110 pop.), also named for an Ontario town,\r\nis now predominantly Polish. LAKE ARDOCH, a large artificial lake\r\nconstructed as a water conservation and migratory waterfowl project,\r\nadjoins the town on the E.\r\n\r\nAt =80.5 m.= is the second junction with ND 44 (_see above_).\r\n\r\nMANVEL, =81.5 m.= (826 alt., 183 pop.), is named for Gen. A. A. Manvel\r\nof the G. N. Ry. Originally known as the Turtle River station, it\r\nwas one of six stops on the Fort Abercrombie-Fort Garry trail in\r\nthe 1860's. The stage station was a crude log hut, roofed first with\r\nprairie sod and later with a thatch of weeds when the rain washed the\r\nsod away. The hut had one window and one door. Cooking was done on a\r\nfireplace made of clay dobes or hand-made bricks. For meals, served on\r\nan improvised table, the traveler paid 50 cents, and for the same price\r\nhe had the privilege of sleeping on the dirt floor. These stations were\r\ncomfortable, however, in the coldest weather, with great fires roaring\r\nin the fireplaces to warm and cheer the traveler.\r\n\r\nAt =92.5 m.= is the junction with a graveled road.\r\n\r\nLeft on this road to the GRAND FORKS SILVER FOX FARM, =2 m.= (_visitors\r\nallowed Jan. 1-June 1; arrange with manager_). About 200 pair of foxes\r\nare kept at the farm each winter.\r\n\r\nLeft at =93 m.= is a stone memorial marking a point on the old RED\r\nRIVER OXCART TRAIL between St. Paul, Minn., and Fort Garry (Winnipeg),\r\nCanada. During the late summer and fall most of the traffic through the\r\nregion was on this trail. It was first used by traders at Fort Garry to\r\ntransport furs to St. Paul. The exact route is not known today, but it\r\nis believed to have run through Grand Forks on 3rd St., turned S. at\r\nthe present corner of S. 3rd St. and Minnesota Ave., whence it followed\r\napproximately the route of US 81 to the Lincoln Park golf course. Here\r\nit is believed to have turned E. toward the river, which it followed to\r\nFrog Point (_Belmont, see below_), and thence up the valley. Mr. and\r\nMrs. Charles Cavileer, pioneer settlers at Pembina, made a romantic\r\nhoneymoon journey to St. Paul on this trail in 1840.\r\n\r\nAt =93 m.= is the junction with a graveled road.\r\n\r\nLeft on this road to the NORTHERN PACKING COMPANY PLANT (_open_), =0.3\r\nm.=, which in its 15-year existence (1937) has purchased more than\r\n$20,000,000 worth of livestock.\r\n\r\nAt =93.5 m.= (R) is the NORTH DAKOTA STATE MILL AND ELEVATOR (_open\r\nweekdays 9-5; conducted tours_), a State-owned plant. A product of\r\nthe Nonpartisan League's industrial program, this institution has\r\nplayed an important role in State politics since its opening in 1922.\r\nAs early as 1915 the Society of Equity and the Equity Exchange had\r\nattempted to establish a State-owned elevator, but had failed, and\r\nthis failure hastened the formation of the Nonpartisan League. By\r\n1919 the league was strong enough in the legislature to establish its\r\nindustrial program, part of which was a State mill and elevator. The\r\nState Industrial Commission governs the mill and elevator. Managership\r\nis generally considered a political plum. Whether or not the mill is a\r\npaying venture is a perennially hotly debated question. Its opponents,\r\ntaking into consideration the original cost of the mill, an amount\r\nin excess of $3,000,000, cannot see how it will ever pay for itself,\r\nwhile those who favor its operation maintain that it makes a profit,\r\nand assert further that the creation of a market within the boundaries\r\nof the State is of invaluable benefit to the farmers. Salesmen for\r\nthe State sell the mill's product in eastern States, and one of the\r\naccusations repeatedly hurled at the mill manager during political\r\ncampaigns is that Dakota Maid Flour retails at a lower price in the\r\nEast than in North Dakota.\r\n\r\nA State law requires all official State documents to be stamped \"Buy\r\n'Dakota Maid' Flour.\"\r\n\r\nThe mill and elevator consists of six steel-and-concrete fire-proof\r\nbuildings. The mill proper has three storage wings, and contains three\r\nmills, each with a daily capacity of 1,000 bbl. The elevator, equal in\r\nheight to the average 12-story skyscraper, has a capacity of 1,659,600\r\nbu. Thirty-two storage tanks each have a capacity of 50,000 bu. The\r\nelevator is operated independently of the mill, which buys in the open\r\nmarket and pays a rental to the elevator for storage space. In addition\r\nto Dakota Maid Flour the mill manufactures cereals, oatmeals, and\r\npoultry feeds.\r\n\r\nGRAND FORKS, =94.5 m.= (834 alt., 17,112 pop.) (_see_ GRAND FORKS)\r\n\r\n  _Points of Interest_: University of North Dakota, Wesley College.\r\n\r\nAt N. 16th St. and Skidmore Ave. N. is the junction with US 2 (_see\r\nTour 6_).\r\n\r\nAt =105.5 m.= is the junction with ND 15, a graveled highway.\r\n\r\nRight on this road is THOMPSON, =2 m.= (972 alt., 273 pop.), the center\r\nof a large potato-farming area.\r\n\r\nAt =116.5 m.= is the junction with a graveled road.\r\n\r\nRight on this road is REYNOLDS, =2 m.= (915 alt., 351 pop.), named for\r\nDr. Henry Reynolds, an early settler and temperance apostle. The town\r\nis on the Grand Forks-Traill County line and many of the residents have\r\ntheir business places in one county and their homes in the other.\r\n\r\nAt =121.5 m.= is the junction with a graveled spur.\r\n\r\nRight on this spur is BUXTON, =1 m.= (935 alt., 410 pop.), a\r\nScandinavian town named for Thomas Buxton, a business associate of\r\nBud Reeves, the town site owner. Reeves, active in State politics,\r\nwas one of the leaders in the drive to obtain funds for maintenance\r\nof State colleges after veto of the appropriation bill in 1895 (_see\r\nSide Tour 1A_). When Reeves campaigned for election to Congress on\r\nthe Democratic ticket in 1894 he traveled over the State in what was\r\nprobably the first house trailer ever used here, and one of the first\r\nused in the region. He had a log cabin built on wheels, and in this\r\nhe visited every part of the State, a large cowbell attached to the\r\ncabin announcing his arrival in each town. No mean patriot, during his\r\nspeeches he had with him on the platform the American flag and a live\r\neagle.\r\n\r\nSeveral important personages have been residents of Buxton, including\r\ntwo Governors of the State, R. A. Nestos (1877-) and A. G. Sorlie\r\n(1874-1928); U. S. Senator A. J. Gronna (1858-1922), one of the six\r\nmembers of the Senate who opposed entrance of the United States into\r\nthe World War; and Dr. Lila M. O'Neale (1886-), anthropologist and\r\nethnologist who has engaged in research work in Guatemala under the\r\nauspices of the Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, and is now a faculty\r\nmember at the University of California.\r\n\r\nAt =123.5 m.= is the junction with a dirt road.\r\n\r\nRight on this road is BELMONT, =11.5 m.=, a ghost town which in the\r\n1870's was a booming river port known as Frog Point. It was named by\r\nCapt. Sam Painter, one of the first Red River pilots, on an early\r\ntrip down the river, probably in 1860. Finding the shores almost\r\ncovered with frogs, he is said to have erected a rude sign reading\r\n\"Frog Point\", and through the rise and fall of the town which grew up\r\nthere the name remained. In 1871 the Hudson's Bay Co. established a\r\ntrading post on the point. A year later, because of the fall of the\r\nriver, Frog Point became head of navigation, and in short order was a\r\nrendezvous for boatmen, trappers, hunters, teamsters, and drifters,\r\nall living in tents or hastily constructed buildings. Teamsters\r\nhauling freight overland from the S. in their heavy, eight-horse,\r\nhigh-wheeled \"jumpers\", and trappers and Indians with their catches,\r\nhere boarded the Hudson's Bay Co. steamer _International_, and James\r\nJ. Hill's _Selkirk_. The town, cut from the woods on the bank of the\r\nRed, and towered over by tall oaks, became a wilderness metropolis,\r\nand its reputation spread to Europe. In England it was believed by\r\nmany to be a city of broad avenues and tall spires, second in size\r\nonly to Liverpool, and filled with the hum of industry. Foreign\r\nvisitors, traveling to Fort Garry, looked eagerly for this Red River\r\ncapital, and even their disillusionment on seeing the little backwoods\r\ncity could not dim its reputation. In its streets rough, rugged,\r\nheavy-booted woodsmen, rivermen, and trappers thundered up and down\r\nthe wooden walks, and many a citizen was hastily despatched by their\r\n44's. Heavy-jowled saloonkeepers, slim-fingered sleek gamblers, and gay\r\ndance-hall girls were all a part of the mushroom town.\r\n\r\nNature brought downfall to the Point as quickly as she had elevated\r\nit to importance. The river fell lower still, and Frog Point lost its\r\nposition as head of navigation. Many of its inhabitants departed as\r\nswiftly as they had come. Fire wiped out a number of buildings which\r\nwere never rebuilt. Trade dwindled and storekeepers shut up shop. Some\r\n20 years later, with the river level again up, the town revived as a\r\ngrain-shipping center, but the flood of 1897 ruined grain elevators and\r\ntheir contents, and within a short time the bustle of the town again\r\nfaded into the past. Today the Hudson's Bay Co. building, which houses\r\na farm implement shop, is all that remains of the early affluence.\r\nThe present population of the hamlet, which is not even an organized\r\nvillage, is 33.\r\n\r\nCUMMINGS, =124.5 m.= (935 alt., 84 pop.), named for Henry Cumings, an\r\nearly G. N. employee who helped build the railroad, is principally a\r\nScandinavian community. Originally spelled with one \"m\", its name was\r\nmisspelled so consistently that the Post Office Department legitimized\r\nthe misspelling by inserting the second \"m.\"\r\n\r\nAt =129.5 m.= is the junction with ND 7, a graveled highway (_see Side\r\nTour 1A_).\r\n\r\nHILLSBORO, =132.5 m.= (907 alt., 1,317 pop.), named for James J. Hill,\r\nthe \"Empire Builder\" of the G. N. Ry., was platted in 1880 on the\r\nattractive GOOSE RIVER. A bitter fight for the Traill County seat was\r\nprominent in the early history of the town. Neighboring Caledonia, on\r\nthe Red River, had been the county seat since organization of Traill\r\nCounty in 1875, but the routing of the G. N. Ry. through Hillsboro gave\r\nthat young city aspirations, and in 1890 it came forward as a contender\r\nfor the county seat. The campaign grew heated, and Caledonia citizens\r\ncarried arms and posted guards around their village. To lead their\r\ndefense they organized a committee, whom Hillsboro residents dubbed\r\nTigers of the Jungle and Irreconcilables. The Tigers imported Col. W.\r\nC. Plummer, a widely known professional standard bearer who had served\r\nas campaign speaker in many parts of the country, and whom James G.\r\nBlaine once called \"one of the three best political speakers in the\r\nUnited States.\" The colonel became the leading figure in the county\r\nseat fight. He was an impressive speaker, and the floods of oratory he\r\nloosed in behalf of Caledonia were greatly enjoyed by his listeners.\r\nThe majority of them, however, apparently remained impervious to his\r\narguments--when the votes were counted Hillsboro enjoyed a 1,291 to 218\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\nWOODLAND PARK, a 25-acre recreational and tourist camp area in the\r\nnorthern part of town, contains a log cabin, originally built at\r\nBelmont, in which are an old-fashioned loom once used in weaving the\r\nhomespun clothing of a pioneer family, and other relics of pioneer days.\r\n\r\nRight from Hillsboro on a graveled highway to STONY POINT, =1.5 m.=,\r\nsite of a camp used by pioneers freighting their supplies overland from\r\nFargo during early settlement of the region. The camp site, situated on\r\na sandy ridge left by the recession of glacial Lake Agassiz, is marked\r\nby a large, pointed boulder 20 ft. in diameter, which once served as a\r\nlandmark. In early days it was believed, from the manner in which the\r\nrock was situated in the earth, that it might have dropped from the sky.\r\n\r\nSouth of Hillsboro are many well-built farmsteads--some of which were\r\nonce part of bonanza farms--and four peaceful villages which in bonanza\r\ndays were busy wheat centers, but now lie quietly basking in their\r\nmemories.\r\n\r\nGRANDIN, =146 m.= (898 alt., 172 pop.), is the largest of these towns.\r\nIt was named for J. L. Grandin, one of the two Tidioute, Pa., brothers\r\nwho bought 99 sections of Red River Valley land and farmed them under\r\nthe bonanza system. Dividing their land into 1,500-acre farms, each\r\nwith a superintendent and a foreman, they harvested their first crop\r\nin 1878. They had 14,000 acres under cultivation near Grandin, and\r\n6,000 at Mayville. Before the advent of the railroad the wheat raised\r\non their land was hauled on barges towed by the steamers _Grandin_ and\r\n_Alsop_ to Fargo, a distance of 90 m.--overland Grandin is 35 m. from\r\nFargo. The Grandin farm was one of the earliest practical users of the\r\ntelephone, although whether the first in the State was installed on\r\nthis or the Dalrymple farm (_see Tour 8_) is in dispute.\r\n\r\nGARDNER, =154.5 m.= (891 alt., 108 pop.), named for the town site\r\nowner, was founded in 1880 when the surrounding territory was being\r\ndeveloped as wheat country, but was not incorporated village until 1929.\r\n\r\nARGUSVILLE, =161.5 m.= (889 alt., 115 pop.), is believed to have\r\nreceived its name from the _Daily Argus_, Fargo newspaper published at\r\nthe time of the town's founding in 1880.\r\n\r\nHARWOOD, =169 m.= (892 alt., 82 pop.), was named for A. J. Harwood,\r\na prominent Fargo real estate dealer who bought all the town sites\r\nbetween Fargo and Grand Forks when the G. N. Ry. was built.\r\n\r\nAt =179.3 m.= is the junction with a graveled road.\r\n\r\nRight on this road to HECTOR AIRPORT, =0.5 m.=, a U. S. Department\r\nof Commerce A-1 field, land for which was donated by Martin Hector,\r\npioneer Fargo banker, in 1931. The buildings include a city hangar of\r\nlaminated truss-arch construction, completed in 1936 under the Works\r\nProgress Administration.\r\n\r\nFARGO, 181 m. (907 alt., 28,619 pop.) (_see_ FARGO).\r\n\r\n  _Points of Interest_: North Dakota Agricultural College, Veterans'\r\n  Hospital, Dovre Ski Slide.\r\n\r\nAt Front and 13th Sts. is the junction with US 10 (_see Tour 8_).\r\n\r\nThe WILD RICE RIVER, which the route crosses at =188 m.=, was named for\r\nthe wild grain which formerly grew on its banks. Near here, in a battle\r\nbetween the Sioux and Chippewa in 1807, Tabashaw, a Chippewa chief, was\r\nslain while avenging the death of his eldest son, who had been killed a\r\nshort time before by the Sioux.\r\n\r\nAt =189 m.= is the junction with a dirt road.\r\n\r\nRight on this road is HOLY CROSS CEMETERY, =0.3 m.=, one of the first\r\ncemeteries in the State, established in 1862. The first burial here is\r\nsaid to have been that of a priest who had been beheaded by an Indian.\r\nAnother victim of frontier tragedy whose body rests here was Archibald\r\nMontrose, a young English nobleman who came to America to establish\r\na home. He was found frozen within a few rods of his own door during\r\na blizzard in 1871. His devoted young wife ordered a covered shelf\r\nbuilt on the outside wall of their cabin beneath her bedroom window,\r\nand had his coffin placed there. In the spring, when the ground had\r\nthawed sufficiently to permit the digging of a grave, she unwillingly\r\nconsented to the burial of her husband's body. Soon afterward their\r\nbaby daughter, born after the father's death, died also, and the\r\nmother, her mind affected by the grief of her bereavements, joined them\r\nin the nearby burial ground. For many years a large wooden cross marked\r\nthe spot where Montrose died.\r\n\r\nWILD RICE, =191 m.= (909 alt., 35 pop.), is the center of a\r\nFrench-Canadian farming community.\r\n\r\nHICKSON, =196 m.= (915 alt., 100 pop.), is named for the Ole Hicks\r\nfamily who were early farmers in the vicinity.\r\n\r\nAt =198.5 m.= is the junction with ND 46, a graveled highway.\r\n\r\nRight on this highway to a bridge crossing the SHEYENNE RIVER, =9 m.=\r\nOn the bridge a tablet has been placed reading: \"Sibley Trail 1863.\r\nSibley's Indian Expedition crossed the Sheyenne at this point Aug. 20,\r\nreturning from the Missouri to Fort Abercrombie.\"\r\n\r\nAt =9.5 m.= is the junction with a graveled spur.\r\n\r\nRight on this road to KINDRED, =1 m.= (948 alt., 429 pop.), a\r\ntree-shaded town named for F. E. and W. A. Kindred, surveyors who\r\nplatted the town site and later were large landholders in the vicinity.\r\nThe community is principally Scandinavian. An interesting COLLECTION\r\n(_open by arrangement_) of European museum pieces and Indian artifacts\r\nis owned by Hjalmer Rustad of Kindred, and is kept at his home.\r\n\r\nND 46 traverses a low range of sandy hills, the western rim of glacial\r\nLake Agassiz. At =19 m.= is the junction with a dry-weather dirt road.\r\nLeft on this road at =26.5 m.=, just across the river to the SHEYENNE\r\nRIVER PARK (_central building of native logs, spring-fed swimming pool,\r\nfive picnic areas, cabins, and camp sites_), under development (1938)\r\nas a recreational center by a Federal land utilization project. The\r\npark includes an area of unusual scenic attraction. A road winds along\r\nthe heavily wooded river bottom, and side roads and graveled trails\r\nlead out of the valley to the sand dunes which stretch away to the S.\r\nThe great plain here was deposited in glacial days, when the rushing\r\nSheyenne, then a large stream carrying the sediment-laden waters of the\r\nmelting ice sheet, flowed into Lake Agassiz. As the lake retreated the\r\nsand was left to the winds, which pushed and whipped it into dunes that\r\ndip away toward the horizon. Hummocks of trees and shrubs appear like\r\ngreen islands in this wide sea of dull brown. In some places, to combat\r\nthe moving sand, elm and oak bark has been laid lengthwise in the road\r\nto preserve the trail.\r\n\r\nCHRISTINE, =204.5 m.= (926 alt., 204 pop.), has a population 95 percent\r\nScandinavian. When Christine Nilsson, the noted Swedish operatic\r\nsoprano, appeared in the United States in 1873, she was honored by\r\nAmerican Scandinavians, who named this town for her. A COLLECTION\r\n(_open by arrangement_) of pioneer implements, including spinning\r\nwheels, brass kitchen utensils, and relics from Fort Abercrombie, is\r\nowned by Dr. M. U. Ivers.\r\n\r\nABERCROMBIE, =212.5 m.= (935 alt., 242 pop.), is a typically peaceful\r\nsmall town on the banks of the Red River. The air of serenity which\r\nlies over its tree-lined streets and substantial homes is in decided\r\ncontrast with the bustling activity of the settlement which surrounded\r\nthe pioneer post of Fort Abercrombie, first Federal fort in North\r\nDakota, built in 1858. It was named for Lt. Col. John J. Abercrombie,\r\nofficer in charge of its erection. The most westerly outpost of the\r\nsettlers' advance during the 1860's, Fort Abercrombie became the\r\ngateway to the Dakotas. From here expeditions set out to the unexplored\r\nplains of the Northwest, and trains of settlers left by oxcart and\r\ncovered wagons to seek homes on the prairie beyond.\r\n\r\nIt was between Fort Abercrombie and Fort Garry that the first steamboat\r\nto ply the waters of the Red River of the North carried passengers\r\nand freight. Built in Georgetown in 1859, the _Anson Northrup_, named\r\nfor its owner, who hauled the machinery overland from the Mississippi\r\nRiver, made its maiden trip to the Canadian post the same summer.\r\n\r\nBecause of its position on the outskirts of the white settlement,\r\nFort Abercrombie was particularly vulnerable to Indian attacks, and\r\nduring the Minnesota uprising of 1862 was besieged for five weeks by\r\nthe hostile Sioux. The first attack, September 3, was repulsed with\r\nthe loss of one man. At the close of this encounter the defenders\r\ndiscovered that only 350 rounds of rifle ammunition remained---\r\na supply had been ordered in the spring but had not arrived. The\r\ningenuity of the garrison was exercised; canister shells for the\r\n12-pound howitzers contained balls which fitted the rifles, so the\r\nwomen in the fort were put to work opening the canisters. The makeshift\r\nammunition served its purpose well.\r\n\r\nThe fort had no stockade; consequently, after the first attack, the\r\ndefenders threw up around the entire fort a cordwood breastwork 8 ft.\r\nhigh. In the meantime messengers had slipped through the Indian lines\r\nto summon aid from Fort Snelling at Minneapolis. On September 6 a force\r\nestimated at 400 warriors again attacked the fort, but was driven\r\nback after a long fight in which two soldiers were killed and many\r\nwounded. The Indians made no more determined attacks on the fort, but\r\ncontinually harassed the beleaguered settlers with desultory sniping\r\nuntil the arrival of a detachment of 350 infantrymen from Fort Snelling\r\nrelieved the garrison September 23.\r\n\r\nIn November of the same year 10 acres of the fort reserve were enclosed\r\nby a heavy oak-log stockade with blockhouses at three corners, and\r\nabout the same time a larger garrison was stationed at Abercrombie. It\r\nwas from this enlarged post that the Sibley expedition set forth to\r\npunish the Sioux the following summer (_see_ HISTORY). The enlarged\r\ngarrison was maintained until the abandonment of the fort in 1877.\r\nDuring the 1870's Fort Abercrombie was the point from which trails led\r\nW. to Forts Totten, Ransom, Wadsworth, and Garry, and many a train of\r\nhome seekers or gold seekers spent a few days there before embarking on\r\nthe hazardous trip through Dakota.\r\n\r\nFort Abercrombie in 1870 was the scene of a treaty between the Chippewa\r\nand Sioux, concluded through the influence of Father J. B. Genin,\r\na Roman Catholic priest. After this treaty the eastern part of the\r\nTerritory was comparatively free from fear of Indian attacks.\r\n\r\nFORT ABERCROMBIE STATE PARK, on the eastern edge of the town, preserves\r\n7 acres of the original 7 sq. m. of military reservation. The park\r\nlies along the river, and its natural beauty makes it a pleasant\r\nrecreation center. An old cabin in the park houses a collection of\r\nearly-day relics. Nearby stands a Red River oxcart whose wooden wheels\r\nonce creaked over the old river trail before the days of railroads and\r\nhighways.\r\n\r\nDWIGHT, =224 m.= (959 alt., 104 pop.), was named for Jeremiah W.\r\nDwight, head of a large bonanza farm company organized here in 1879,\r\nand was the home of John Miller, first Governor of North Dakota. Miller\r\nwas superintendent of the Dwight Farm and Land Company, which operated\r\n27,000 acres, and was established with a cash capital of $150,000. The\r\nMILLER RESIDENCE (_private_), former home of the family, is R. of US 81\r\nin the southeastern corner of the village.\r\n\r\nAt =227.5 m.= is the junction with ND 13, a graveled highway.\r\n\r\nRight on this road is MOORETON, =7 m.= (966 alt., 147 pop.). Here is\r\nthe headquarters farm of F. A. Bagg, one of the largest landowners in\r\nthe Red River Valley. He maintains three airplanes in a hangar on his\r\nfarm and supervises his holdings by air.\r\n\r\nWAHPETON (Sioux, _village of the leaves_), =233 m.= (969 alt., 3,176\r\npop.), is at the confluence of the Bois de Sioux (Fr., _forest of\r\nthe Sioux_) and Ottertail Rivers, where the two streams meet to form\r\nthe Red River of the North. From 1871 to 1893 the town was known as\r\nChahinkapa (Sioux, _top of the trees_), an old Indian name given this\r\narea by the Sioux who, coming from the W. to fight the Chippewa, would\r\nhere see the tops of the trees appear over the level prairie.\r\n\r\nAlexander Faribault, for whom Faribault, Minn., was named, has told of\r\nvisiting the present site of Wahpeton in 1810 when 3,000 Indians were\r\nencamped and engaged in hunting buffalo and drying the meats for food.\r\nAt that time the grasslands along the Red River were black with bison,\r\nwho summered on the grazing lands here, and wintered on the uplands of\r\nthe Missouri Slope W. of the Missouri River.\r\n\r\nThat politics was a momentous vocation when Wahpeton was a young county\r\nseat is indicated in this political advertisement in an 1880 issue of\r\nthe Richland County _Gazette_:\r\n\r\n  \"Republicans of Richland County, please remember and vote for me\r\n  on election day. Come old and young, father and son, one and all\r\n  and vote for me. Do not look on money or on the rich man but on an\r\n  honest man. I have come to this lovely country and have made my\r\n  happy home and I will be a good citizen of Richland County. You\r\n  know I am a candidate for County Treasurer of Richland County. Come\r\n  and spend the whole day on election day and vote for me. We are all\r\n  brothers and sisters. It makes no difference whether a man is rich\r\n  or poor, if he is honest; then he is a good man. Come all and see\r\n  me on election day, in our nice town of Wahpeton.\"\r\n\r\nThe RICHLAND COUNTY COURTHOUSE here, built in a modified Classic style\r\nwith a cupola, is considered a good example of the official buildings\r\nin this State. The first floor exterior is of Kettle River sandstone,\r\nwith upper stories and dome of Bedford limestone. Across the street\r\nfrom the courthouse is the LEACH PUBLIC LIBRARY, a light-colored brick\r\nand sandstone building presented to the city in 1923 by Mr. and Mrs. O.\r\nA. Leach, Wahpeton residents since 1896. The library contains 14,000\r\nvolumes.\r\n\r\nIn the northern part of Wahpeton are the STATE SCHOOL OF SCIENCE and\r\nthe U. S. INDIAN SCHOOL. The science school is a vocational institution\r\nand junior college with a trades educational program that has received\r\nrecognition outside the State. Near the entrance to the landscaped\r\ncampus is a cast bronze life-size bust of the Norwegian poet-dramatist\r\nHenrik Ibsen, the work of Jacob Fjelde, distinguished Norwegian\r\nsculptor who made his home in Minneapolis from 1877 until his death in\r\n1896. Another portrait of Ibsen in Como Park in St. Paul, Minn., is\r\nalso the work of Fjelde; these are said to be the only statues of Ibsen\r\nin the U. S. The bust at Wahpeton was a gift to the city and Richland\r\nCounty from the Norwegian people of the county, and was unveiled at\r\nceremonies held on Norwegian Independence Day, May 17, 1912. The figure\r\nstands on a tapering rough-hewn 8-foot granite pedestal.\r\n\r\nThe Indian school consists of 40 red-brick buildings housing 300\r\nstudents, mainly Sioux and Chippewa from reservations in North and\r\nSouth Dakota and Minnesota. In addition to academic work through the\r\nninth grade, vocational training in farm methods is taught the boys,\r\nwhile the girls receive instruction in home economics and sanitation.\r\n\r\nCHAHINKAPA PARK, in the northeastern part of Wahpeton, lies between the\r\nhigh banks of the old bed of the Red River and the present channel,\r\nits inviting woods cut off from the mainland by meandering lagoons.\r\nImprovements and recreational facilities (_swimming pool, playgrounds,\r\nathletic field_) by Federal agencies were completed under the Works\r\nProgress Administration (1937).\r\n\r\nWahpeton was the home of the late U. S. Senator Porter J. McCumber, who\r\ngained national recognition for his work on the Fordney-McCumber Tariff\r\nBill.\r\n\r\nThe route leaves Wahpeton by way of 2nd St., and for 5 m. follows a\r\nwinding course parallel to the Bois de Sioux. This portion of the\r\nhighway runs over a trail used in 1823 by the military expedition of\r\nMaj. Stephen H. Long sent to establish the Canadian boundary, and still\r\nlater as a freight route between St. Cloud, Minn., Fort Abercrombie,\r\nand Pembina in the 1860's and 1870's.\r\n\r\nFAIRMOUNT, =247.5 m.= (985 alt., 611 pop.), named for Fairmount Park in\r\nPhiladelphia, Pa., was platted in 1887 until which time it was known as\r\nMichigan Settlement because many of its settlers came from that State.\r\nOf interest in the town is the widely known SERMON IN STONE, an obelisk\r\nerected in St. Anthony's Roman Catholic churchyard by Rev. G. C.\r\nBierens. Stones and ores, some semiprecious, have come from all parts\r\nof the world to be patterned into this bright-colored shrine. The Ten\r\nCommandments, Faith, Hope, and Charity, the Trinity, the Sacraments,\r\nand many other abstractions are symbolized in stone.\r\n\r\nFather Bierens is an authority on bird life in the Red River Valley,\r\nand operates a U. S. Biological Survey BIRD BANDING STATION (1937), one\r\nof the few in the State. Since he began the work in 1928 he has banded\r\nmore than 10,000 birds, never less than 1,000 a year, and as many as 70\r\nspecies in one season, not including field and shore or water birds. In\r\nApril 1935 he banded the first European starling caught in North Dakota.\r\n\r\nAt the F. P. Nelson store in Fairmount is a COLLECTION (_open by\r\narrangement_) of Indian artifacts and of firearms, including a Chinese\r\ngun made in 1526.\r\n\r\nRight from Fairmount on ND 11, a graveled road, is HANKINSON, =11\r\nm.= (1,068 alt., 1,400 pop.), named for R. H. Hankinson, town site\r\nowner. Here are the CONVENT AND ACADEMY OF THE SISTERS OF ST. FRANCIS,\r\nthe mother house of the order in the United States. This order was\r\nestablished in Germany in 1241. The convent and academy, founded in\r\n1927-29, are housed in a three-story Renaissance-style building of\r\ntapestry brick trimmed in Indiana limestone. In a niche over the\r\nentrance is a statue of St. Francis, carved in Danube limestone by the\r\nJoseph Mueller Art Institute of Munich, Germany, and donated to the\r\norder.\r\n\r\nSouth of Fairmount the distant Coteau des Prairies is visible (R).\r\nBack in these hills, which form part of the watershed between the\r\nGulf of Mexico and Hudson Bay, live the Sioux Indians of the Sisseton\r\nReservation, a triangular section of which juts into the State from\r\nSouth Dakota.\r\n\r\nAt =256.5 m.= US 81 crosses the North Dakota Line, 106 m. N. of\r\nWatertown, S. Dak. (_see S. Dak. Tour 10_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIDE TOUR 1A\r\n\r\n\r\n  Junction US 81--Mayville--Portland--Hatton.

The route proceeds along\r\nthe western edge of glacial Lake Agassiz. The rich, black soil--a\r\nsandless, clayey silt, peculiar to western States and locally known\r\nas gumbo--becomes a muggy, sticky mass when wet. Before the era of\r\ngraveled highways, travel was virtually impossible after even the\r\nlightest rainfall, as wagon or automobile wheels became clogged with\r\nthe heavy, gummy earth; even today this is true on unimproved roads.\r\n\r\nND 7 branches W. from US 81 (_see Tour 1_) 5 m. S. of Cummings.\r\n\r\nMAYVILLE, =12 m.= (891 alt., 1,199 pop.), was named for May Arnold,\r\nfirst white child born in the Hudson's Bay Co. trading post established\r\nnear the present town site in the early 1870's. It is a small,\r\ntree-shaded, staid college town on the banks of the Goose River. First\r\nsettled in 1881, it was moved to the railroad which was built through\r\nhere in 1883. In that year Mayville and Portland conspired to win the\r\ncounty seat for a new town, Traill Center, platted midway between the\r\ntwo older towns, planning that if their candidate won the election\r\nthe three towns would merge into one city. So brisk was the campaign\r\nthat the ballots cast outnumbered the legal voters, and Traill Center\r\nwon 2,011 to 450. The election was contested, however, and while the\r\ncase was in litigation the Territorial legislature transferred the two\r\nwestern tiers of townships in Traill County to Steele County. This lost\r\nTraill Center its strategic position and with it the county seat.\r\n\r\nMAYVILLE STATE TEACHERS COLLEGE, in the northern part of the town,\r\nfounded in 1889, held its first classes in 1893. When Gov. Roger Allin\r\nin 1895 vetoed funds for operating the colleges in North Dakota,\r\nenterprising citizens kept the schools open by popular subscription.\r\nBud Reeves, wealthy Minneapolis man who pioneered at Buxton and later\r\nbecame a political figure in the State (_see Tour 1_), was one of the\r\nleaders in the drive for funds to support the schools. In one day he\r\ncollected $2,000 from heads of large Minneapolis grain firms.\r\n\r\nOn the college campus is a log cabin built in 1879 and used as the\r\nfirst schoolhouse in the Mayville area.\r\n\r\nALM'S PARK, on the eastern edge of the city, is a tourist park and\r\ncamp; ISLAND PARK, in the western part, is a recreational center.\r\nRAILROAD PARK, E. of the Great Northern depot, contains a tall marble\r\npillar on which is a bronze plaque bearing a relief of Bjornstjerne\r\nBjornson, famed Norwegian author. The plaque is the work of Paul\r\nFjelde, who once attended the Valley City Teachers College (_see Tour\r\n8_).\r\n\r\nIn Mayville is the home of Rev. and Mrs. A. M. West, parents of the\r\netcher Levon West (1900-), who has also won recognition for photography\r\nunder the pseudonym of Ivan Dmitri.\r\n\r\nAt the western end of the long business street of PORTLAND, =14.5\r\nm.= (987 alt., 500 pop.), is the gravel ridge of CAMPBELL'S BEACH,\r\nsecond hump of sand laid down in prehistoric times by the retreating\r\nwaters of Lake Agassiz. Portland has four producers and consumers\r\ncooperatives--an oil company, elevator, creamery, and store. Across the\r\nstreet from a large Lutheran church in the western part of the town\r\nstand the now unused buildings of BRUFLAT ACADEMY, one of the first\r\nprivate educational institutions in the State, established by the local\r\nLutheran Church in 1889. Portland and vicinity were first settled in\r\n1871, and the place became a boom town when the railroad arrived in\r\n1881.\r\n\r\nAt =19 m.= is the junction (R) with ND 18, a graveled highway on which\r\nthe route proceeds N.\r\n\r\nAt =24 m.= is the junction with a county dirt road.\r\n\r\nLeft on this road to the THORVAL STAVENS FARM, =1 m.=, where the\r\nsuccess story of an outstanding but nevertheless typical Norwegian\r\nimmigrant family is told by the buildings ranging from the lowly sod\r\nhouse of Hans Anderson Stavensbraaten, who homesteaded here in 1870,\r\nto the 15-room home and the airplane hangar of his grandson, Thorval\r\nStavens. The original family home and its contents are preserved as a\r\nMUSEUM. Across the road is the first school in the district, built in\r\n1879.\r\n\r\nHATTON, =27 m.= (1,085 alt., 804 pop.), named for Frank Hatton, Third\r\nAssistant Postmaster General when the town was founded in 1882, is at\r\nthe southern end of the Elk River Delta, a rich, fertile deposit laid\r\ndown in ancient times as the waters of the melting glacier flowed into\r\nLake Agassiz.\r\n\r\nHatton was the birthplace and boyhood home of Col. Carl Ben Eielson\r\n(1897-1929), pioneer Alaskan aviator. Eielson left the University of\r\nWisconsin to enlist in the Army Air Service in 1916. Following the\r\nWorld War he barnstormed in North Dakota and neighboring States in a\r\nplane purchased for him by friends in the vicinity of Hatton. In 1922\r\nhe went to Alaska where he pioneered in aviation and flew the first\r\nair mail in the Territory. His experience as an Arctic flyer drew the\r\nattention of the English explorer Sir Hubert Wilkins, and in 1928 the\r\npair made their flight across the top of the world from Point Barrow to\r\nSpitzbergen. When Wilkins gave his attention to the Antarctic, Eielson\r\npiloted him on several flights over that continent. He returned to\r\nAlaska in 1929 and late that year was killed while attempting to save\r\nthe passengers and cargo of the ice-bound ship _Nanuk_ off North Cape,\r\nSiberia. He had already made one trip to the ship, bringing back six\r\npassengers and part of the fur cargo, when a fierce storm took its\r\ntoll. Eielson and his mechanic, Earl Borland, crashed, and it was more\r\nthan a month before their bodies were found in the wreckage of their\r\nplane. Eielson's body was returned with honors to Hatton, where it was\r\ninterred in the family plot, marked with an unpretentious stone. In the\r\nCITY HALL is the _Alaskan_, a plane he used in his explorations with\r\nWilkins in 1926, and at the ELMER OSKING HOME is a collection of the\r\nmany medals he received. A part of the fin of the Hamilton all-metal\r\nplane in which he died is displayed in the museum of the State\r\nhistorical society (_see_ BISMARCK).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOUR 2\r\n\r\n\r\n  (Brandon, Man., Can.)--Hansboro--Cando--Minnewaukan--Jamestown--\r\n    Edgeley--Ellendale--(Aberdeen, S.

R. between Jamestown and Edgeley.\r\n\r\n  Graveled roadbed entire route except for 3 m. dirt grade from\r\n  Canadian boundary to Hansboro.\r\n\r\n  Accommodations in principal towns.\r\n\r\nSouth of the international boundary the route traverses an uneven\r\nterrain formed by mighty glaciers as they retreated across the region\r\nduring the ice age. It passes Devils and Arrowood Lakes and crosses\r\nthe pleasant wooded valleys of the Sheyenne and James Rivers. Between\r\nthe groves and farmhouses along the way are thousands of acres of open\r\nfields and grasslands. Brown and black in spring, these soon turn green\r\nwith the crops of wheat, oats, barley, corn, and cultivated grasses\r\ngrown in this diversified farming area. The southern part of the route\r\npasses through some of the best pheasant-hunting country in the State,\r\nwhile grouse and duck are also plentiful.\r\n\r\nND 4 crosses the Canadian boundary, =0.0 m.=, 8 m. S. of Cartwright,\r\nMan., Canada.\r\n\r\nHANSBORO, =3 m.= (1,595 alt., 176 pop.), is named for Henry Clay\r\nHansbrough, the first Representative (1889-91) sent to Congress from\r\nNorth Dakota, and later U. S. Senator (1891-1909). The town is a port\r\nof entry, and the U. S. customhouse is here.\r\n\r\nAt =15 m.= is the junction with ND 5 (_see Tour 5_), a graveled\r\nhighway, which between this point and =20 m.= is identical with ND 4.\r\n\r\nROCK LAKE, =21 m.= (1,548 alt., 279 pop.), is on the southern end\r\nof the long, narrow, fresh-water lake of the same name. The U. S.\r\nBiological Survey has created a migratory waterfowl sanctuary by\r\nconstructing a large, earthfill dam on the lake just NE. of town.\r\nOverflow from the water impounded will be sufficient to raise the\r\nlevels of a number of smaller lakes in the area. At Rock Lake is a\r\njunction (L) with ND 5 (_see Tour 5_).\r\n\r\nAt =35 m.= is a junction with a county road.\r\n\r\nLeft on this road to SNYDER LAKE, =3 m.=, a recreational center\r\n(_swimming and picnicking facilities_).\r\n\r\nCANDO, =44.5 m.= (1,486 alt., 1,164 pop.), received its name at a\r\ncounty commissioners' meeting in 1884, when, during the heat of an\r\nargument over the selection of the Towner County seat, P. P. Parker,\r\nchairman of the board, called out above the confusion, \"There has been\r\nmuch talk about our not having power to locate this county seat where\r\nwe see fit. But we'll show you that we can do it. And furthermore, just\r\nto show you what we can do, we'll name this county seat 'Can-do.'\"\r\n\r\nLeft from Cando on ND 17, a graveled highway, to a DUNKER (Dunkard)\r\nCOLONY, =8 m.= (about 100 members), the first settlement of this\r\nreligious organization in the State. The sect, known officially as\r\nthe German Baptist Brethren, originated in Germany in 1708. Shortly\r\nthereafter its members began to come to Pennsylvania, whence they\r\nspread westward. The group at Cando was brought in by the G. N. Ry. in\r\n1894 to aid in colonizing the land along their route. The practices and\r\ntenets of the Dunkers (Ger., _those who dip or immerse_) are similar to\r\nthose of the Baptists. Older members still retain many of the early\r\ncustoms of plain dress, no jewelry or other adornment, simple living,\r\nand no form of insurance; the women wear the small lace prayer cap for\r\nchurch attendance. A harvest festival in early October has become an\r\noutstanding holiday of the church life.\r\n\r\nMAZA, =53.5 m.= (1,463 alt., 70 pop.), is the center of a\r\nwheat-producing and stock-raising community. The derivation of the name\r\nof the town is not definitely known, but is believed to have been from\r\n_maize_, the Indian word for corn.\r\n\r\nAt =54 m.= is the junction with a graveled county road.\r\n\r\nLeft on this road is LAC AUX MORTES (Fr., _lake of the dead_), =4.5\r\nm.=, named by French trappers who visited the region in the early\r\n1860's. Indian tradition says that one winter during a severe smallpox\r\nepidemic the dead were so numerous that the trees were filled with\r\nbodies. Fire destroyed the woods a few years later. At the present time\r\n(1938) the lake is nearly dry.\r\n\r\nAt =59 m.= is the junction with US 2, which unites with US 81 between\r\nthis point and =66 m.=\r\n\r\nBetween BRINSMADE, =72 m.= (1,560 alt., 199 pop.), named for a noted\r\nCongregational minister, the Rev. S. Brinsmade, of Beloit, Wis.,\r\nand MINNEWAUKAN (Sioux, _spirit water_), =84 m.= (1,458 alt., 480\r\npop.), the road makes several sharp, right-angle turns, necessitating\r\ncautious driving. Minnewaukan, the Benson County seat, during its\r\nearly years stood on the western shore of Devils Lake, and there was a\r\nsteamboat landing on the eastern edge of town, where the Benson County\r\nfairgrounds now stand. The shore line of the lake has receded, however,\r\nand for many years the water has not reached within several miles of\r\nthis point.\r\n\r\nSouth of Minnewaukan the road skirts land that was the bed of Devils\r\nLake when that body of water was truly an inland sea, and crosses drift\r\nprairie, from which the chain of high morainic hills bordering Devils\r\nLake is visible (L) in the distance, and reaches the pretty valley of\r\nthe SHEYENNE RIVER, named for the Cheyenne (Sioux, _people of alien\r\nspeech_) Indians. Early explorers misspelled the name, changing C to\r\nS--an error that aids in distinguishing this river from the Cheyenne of\r\nSouth Dakota. In crossing the stream here the route descends into the\r\nvalley over terraces cut by glacial waters thousands of years ago.\r\n\r\nSHEYENNE, =105.5 m.= (1,476 alt., 417 pop.), on the river, originally\r\nwas a mile and a half from its present site, and was moved when the\r\nsurvey for the N. P. Ry. was made.\r\n\r\nNEW ROCKFORD, =116 m.= (1,533 alt., 2,195 pop.), on the James River\r\napproximately 25 m. from its source, was first called Garrison, later\r\nRockford, and still later, with the coming of the N. P. Ry., New\r\nRockford. It is the Eddy County seat and the home of Ole H. Olson, a\r\nGovernor of the State (1934).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nLAW BUILDING, UNIVERSITY, GRAND FORKS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nROOSEVELT MONUMENT, MINOT]\r\n\r\nBARLOW, =124 m.= (1,537 alt., 322 pop.), was named for its founder, F.\r\nG. Barlow, who as a member of the first North Dakota Legislature (1889)\r\nfought the Louisiana Lottery bill (_see_ HISTORY).\r\n\r\nCARRINGTON, =132.5 m.= (1,579 alt., 1,717 pop.), is named for M. D.\r\nCarrington, who platted the city in 1882, and gave sites for the\r\nschool, churches, and Foster County Courthouse. It has a 10,000-volume\r\nMUNICIPAL LIBRARY in the City Hall on Central Ave. and 1st St. N. On\r\nthe western side of town is a landscaped and well-equipped tourist\r\ncamp. Here is a junction with US 52 (_see Tour 7_), which unites with\r\nUS 281 between this point and Jamestown.\r\n\r\nMELVILLE, =142 m.= (1,597 alt., 50 pop.), was originally laid out as\r\nNew Port, but because of a disagreement over the price of the site the\r\nrailway company moved the town one-half mile W. and called it Melville.\r\n\r\nAt EDMUNDS, =149 m.= (1,594 alt., 100 pop.), is the junction with a\r\ngraveled county road.\r\n\r\nLeft on this road to ARROWOOD LAKE, =6 m.=, the largest of the chain\r\nof three lakes through which the James River flows. Before white\r\nsettlement the Indians came here from great distances to obtain\r\nJuneberry shoots for their arrow shafts. On the southeastern shore is\r\na CCC CAMP, and on the western shore the buildings of the ARROWOOD\r\nMIGRATORY REFUGE. This reserve is highly valued by the Biological\r\nSurvey as a summer breeding ground, and is an important feeding place\r\nfor pelicans.\r\n\r\nPINGREE, =155 m.= (1,547 alt., 266 pop.), was named for Hazen Senter\r\nPingree, who, with a rack and wagon and a team of oxen, came to Dakota\r\nTerritory in 1880 to start a potato plantation. His venture was a\r\nfailure, so he went to Michigan, where he became an important shoe\r\nmanufacturer, was made mayor of Detroit, and twice served as Governor\r\nof the State (1897-1900).\r\n\r\nBUCHANAN, =163 m.= (1,546 alt., 150 pop.), was named for its founder,\r\nJames A. Buchanan, a prominent early settler.\r\n\r\nSouth of Buchanan the route continues over rolling terrain toward\r\nthe valley of the James River, a steep-sided, flat-bottomed trough,\r\napproximately a mile wide.\r\n\r\nJAMESTOWN, =176 m.= (1,405 alt., 8,187 pop.) (_see Tour 8_).\r\n\r\n  _Points of Interest_: Jamestown College, State Hospital for the\r\n  Insane, Fort Seward State Park.\r\n\r\nAt 5th Ave. and 3rd St. is the junction with US 10 (_see Tour 8_).\r\n\r\nThe area L. of the route here was once the scene of one of those\r\ndevastating prairie fires that terrorized and impoverished the early\r\nfarmers of the Plains States. This blaze, which began Sept. 25, 1888,\r\nswept the entire region from near Jamestown to LaMoure.\r\n\r\n  \"A heavy and smoke laden atmosphere and a sky streaked with a\r\n  dull red reflection of burning grass proclaimed the fierce raging\r\n  of prairie fires north, south and west of the city last night,\"\r\n  reported the Jamestown _Daily Alert_.... \"For at least 40 miles\r\n  in width the fire burned off every vestige of grass unprotected by\r\n  breaks. One could hardly recognize the charred land the next day.\r\n  Thousands of bushels of grain were burned and many men lost all\r\n  they had, grain, buildings and stock.\"\r\n\r\nEDGELEY, =215 m.= (1,565 alt., 821 pop.), was named by Richard Sykes,\r\nonce owner of the site, for his former home in England. It is the\r\nmeeting point of an N. P. Ry. branch line, a branch of the Milwaukee R.\r\nR., and the Midland main line.\r\n\r\nFrom Edgeley to the South Dakota Line, the hills of the Missouri\r\nPlateau loom (R) in the distance.\r\n\r\nAt =237 m.= is a junction with a graveled county road.\r\n\r\nLeft on this road to WHITESTONE HILL BATTLEFIELD STATE PARK, =16 m.=,\r\nwhere Gen. Alfred Sully and his command met a band of Sioux Indians on\r\nthe evening of Sept. 3, 1863, in the most severe engagement fought on\r\nNorth Dakota soil since the coming of the white man. A granite monument\r\n25 ft. in height, bearing the figure of a mounted cavalryman, has been\r\nerected about three-fourths of a mile NW. of the site of the battle.\r\nReinterred about the base of the monument, each with an appropriate\r\nmarker, are the remains of the soldiers who died here. Generals Sully\r\nand Sibley had been sent out from Minnesota to punish the Indians who\r\nhad taken part in the Minnesota Massacre of 1862. Sully was to move up\r\nthe Missouri, while Sibley marched W. across the country. When Sully,\r\ndelayed by low water, arrived in the neighborhood of present Bismarck,\r\nwhere he was to meet Sibley, he found the latter had given up the idea\r\nof the proposed meeting and started on the return journey to Minnesota.\r\nHe also discovered that the Sioux, who had fled over the Missouri upon\r\nSibley's approach, had now recrossed to their old hunting grounds on\r\nthe James River. He immediately set out in pursuit, and overtook them\r\nin a three-day march. The Indians retreated while the soldiers, on\r\nhigher ground, poured in a murderous fire. Sully's casualties were 34\r\nmen wounded and 19 killed, while the Indian loss was estimated at 150.\r\nIt is now believed that the Sioux encountered here did not take part in\r\nthe Minnesota Massacre. The perpetrators of the massacre were known to\r\nhave fled W., however, and it was natural for the soldiers to regard\r\nany Indians they met as enemies.\r\n\r\nELLENDALE, =248 m.= (1,448 alt., 1,264 pop.), named for Ellen Dale\r\nMerrill, wife of a Milwaukee R. R. official, is the Dickey County\r\nseat. At the end of Main St. on the eastern edge of the trim little\r\ntown, attractively arranged on a well-kept campus, are the six brick\r\nbuildings of the STATE NORMAL AND INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL, a teachers college\r\nand vocational institution. When it opened its doors in 1889 it offered\r\nthe first free course in manual training in the United States.\r\n\r\nAt =253 m.= US 281 crosses the South Dakota Line, 35 m. N. of Aberdeen,\r\nS. Dak. (_see S. Dak. Tour 11_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOUR 3\r\n\r\n\r\n  (Virden, Man.,\r\n  Can.)--Westhope--Minot--Washburn--Bismarck--Linton--(Pierre, S.\r\n  Dak.). US 83.\r\n\r\n  Canadian boundary to South Dakota Line, 278.5 m.\r\n\r\n  Soo Ry. branch parallels route between Max and Bismarck, N. P.\r\n  Ry. main line between Bismarck and Sterling, N.

As the crops mature the chief\r\ntones of the landscape gradually change to amber and gold, until after\r\nharvest the fields are covered with tawny, violet-shadowed stubble,\r\ndotted with the dull taupe of Russian thistle. Along the Mouse River\r\nand the Missouri, the timberland is a vivid green in summer, and in\r\nautumn becomes a fantasy of fall color in which yellows, ochers,\r\nscarlets, and copper all strive for dominance.\r\n\r\nUS 83 crosses the Canadian border 8 m. S. of Coulter, Man., Canada.\r\nHere is a customhouse.\r\n\r\nWESTHOPE, =6 m.= (1,508 alt., 521 pop.), is a port of entry to Canada.\r\nIt was named by an official of a G. N. Ry. town site company, who\r\nexpected exceptional agricultural prosperity for the town. Far to the\r\nL., beyond the level prairie that is the bed of the great prehistoric\r\nlake, are the blue shadows outlining the Turtle Mountains (_see Tour\r\n5_).\r\n\r\nAt =12.5 m.= is the junction with ND 5 (_see Tour 5_), which unites\r\nwith US 83 to =29.5 m.=\r\n\r\nMINOT, =66.5 m.= (1,560 alt., 16,099 pop.) (_see_ MINOT).\r\n\r\n  _Points of Interest:_ Minot State Teachers College, Roosevelt Park\r\n  and Zoo.\r\n\r\nAt 2nd St. and 4th Ave. SW. is the junction with US 2 (_see Tour 6_)\r\nand US 52 (_see Tour 7_).\r\n\r\nSouth of Minot the route is over level drift prairie, gradually rising\r\nto a ridge of hills at =85 m.= This is the HEIGHT OF LAND, the northern\r\nrim of the Plateau du Missouri, which is the watershed between the\r\nGulf of Mexico and Hudson Bay, and also marks the farthest advance of\r\nthe last glacier. In addition to its geologic interest, the elevation\r\ncommands a view northward almost to the Canadian border.\r\n\r\nMAX, =96 m.= (2,100 alt., 500 pop.), a Russo-German community, was\r\nnamed for the eldest son of an early settler.\r\n\r\nAt =109 m.= is the junction with ND 37 (_see Side Tour 3A_).\r\n\r\nCOLEHARBOR, =118 m.= (1,900 alt., 153 pop.), derives its name from the\r\nunsuccessful attempt to make this a river shipping point for lignite\r\ncoal, which is mined in this vicinity.\r\n\r\nUNDERWOOD, =126 m.= (2,020 alt., 488 pop.), is the center of a large\r\ndiversified farming area. The railway conductor for whom it was named,\r\nin appreciation of the honor, donated a bell to the school. The town\r\nhas a circulating library, begun by a 72-year-old man, Edward Erickson,\r\nwho bound newspaper and magazine stories into books. With these he\r\nbegan his collection, and by the time of his death in 1932 his work,\r\ntogether with donations, had resulted in a library of 8,000 volumes,\r\nmost of them now available to the public at the office of the Underwood\r\n_News_.\r\n\r\nWASHBURN, =143 m.= (1,731 alt., 753 pop.), McLean County seat, on the\r\neastern bank of the Missouri River, is named for Gen. W. D. Washburn\r\nof Minneapolis, who was instrumental in its development. One of the\r\nearliest Missouri boat landings was established at Washburn, and\r\nthe town was an important trading post in pioneer days. Where the\r\nwaterworks stand NW. of the city is the SITE OF A SIOUX-ARIKARA BATTLE\r\nfought on May 22, 1869; it resulted in the death of Swift Runner, young\r\nRee chieftain. On E. Main St. stands the LOG CABIN OF JOSEPH HENRY\r\nTAYLOR (_open by arrangement_; _inquire at_ Leader _office_), trapper,\r\nhunter, and author, who built the house near Painted Woods (_see Side\r\nTour 3B_) in the early 1870's. He established a woodyard there, and\r\nalso became the first postmaster of the settlement; the post office\r\nwas a hole cut in the trunk of an oak tree. Taylor printed his books\r\nin his own shop, writing the stories as he set the type by hand. His\r\nbooks include _Frontier and Indian Lives_ and _Kaleidoscopic Lives_,\r\nboth reflecting the somewhat florid literary style of the time, but\r\nnevertheless giving a colorful and engrossing picture of the frontier\r\nof his day.\r\n\r\nRight from W. Main St. in Washburn on a well-marked country road to\r\nFORT MANDAN STATE PARK, =14 m.=, site of Fort Mandan on the north bank\r\nof the big bend in the Missouri. Here the Lewis and Clark expedition\r\nspent the winter of 1804-5 with the friendly Mandan Indians. It was\r\nhere that Sakakawea, or Bird Woman, a young Shoshone Indian girl,\r\njoined the expedition which she helped to guide to the Pacific (_see_\r\nBISMARCK). Warring Sioux destroyed the buildings of the fort in 1805,\r\nand the ever changing river channel has altered the landscape so that\r\nit is impossible to identify the exact site (_see Tour 10_). Near\r\nthe markers that have been erected are the trenches of unidentified\r\nexpeditions.\r\n\r\nAt =150.5 m.= is the junction with a county dirt road (_see Side Tour\r\n3B_).\r\n\r\nWILTON, =160 m.= (2,152 alt., 1,001 pop.), named for Wilton, Maine, is\r\non the McLean-Burleigh County line and is the center of a Ukrainian\r\nsettlement. These people come from Galicia, a province of the former\r\nAustro-Hungarian Empire, and found work in the lignite mines which\r\nat that time were just opening here. One group arrived in 1897 and a\r\nsecond two years later. Many old customs are preserved, including folk\r\ndances performed in picturesque, brightly colored costumes by both old\r\nand young people. The Ukrainians are fond of flowers and their homes\r\nusually have beautiful gardens, in which they can be seen working in\r\nthe early hours of summer days.\r\n\r\nOn opposite sides of the highway at the northern end of town are two\r\nunusual churches, both focal points of the Ukrainian settlement. SS.\r\nPETER AND PAUL GREEK CATHOLIC CHURCH (R) has two steeples topped with\r\nfourchée crosses. It is of the Greco-Slavonic branch of the Greek\r\nChurch. The RUSSIAN ORTHODOX GREEK CATHOLIC CHURCH (L) belongs to the\r\nRusso-Greek branch; a cruciform building, it has three steeples, each\r\nbearing the Greek schismatic cross of papal design, symbolizing the\r\nTrinity, with the lowest member set obliquely to denote that the church\r\ndoes not recognize the authority of the Pope. Both churches use the\r\nJulian calendar and have similar services and holidays.\r\n\r\nA bird-banding station established in Wilton in 1931 by Mrs. W. H. Gray\r\nunder the U. S. Biological Survey banded 5,805 birds of 86 species in\r\nits first five years.\r\n\r\nLeft from Wilton via Main St. to the second largest LIGNITE STRIP MINE\r\nof the Truax-Traer Co., =2 m.= Formerly one of the largest underground\r\nlignite mines in the world (_see Tours 5 & 7_), in 1934-35 it yielded\r\n185,381 tons of coal.\r\n\r\nBISMARCK, =184.5 m.= (1,672 alt., 11,090 pop.) (_see_ BISMARCK).\r\n\r\n  _Points of Interest_: State Capitol, Liberty Memorial Building,\r\n  State Historical Society Museum, Roosevelt Cabin.\r\n\r\nAt 6th St. and Main Ave. is the junction with US 10 (_see Tour 8_),\r\nwhich unites with US 83 between this point and STERLING, =209.5 m.=\r\n(1,807 alt., 110 pop.).\r\n\r\nMOFFIT, =219 m.= (1,738 alt., 130 pop.), is on the west shore of\r\nLONG LAKE, now under development by the U. S. Biological Survey as a\r\nmigratory waterfowl refuge. The town is named for the Moffit family,\r\nwho were the first settlers.\r\n\r\nAs HAZELTON, =233 m.= (1,975 alt., 446 pop.), is neared it has the\r\nappearance of an oil town, due to its numerous windmills which a\r\nforerunner of the modern high-pressure salesman succeeded in selling in\r\nthe community. The town is named for Hazel Roop, the daughter of the\r\ntown site owner.\r\n\r\nSouth of Hazelton the route enters a Russo-German farming area. The\r\nodd, brilliant colors of some of the houses and farm buildings are\r\ncharacteristic of the taste of these people. Diagonal stripes of\r\nalternating bright colors form a favorite decorative scheme for barn\r\nand granary doors. Since the American influence has made itself felt,\r\nhowever, many gaily painted buildings have been dimmed by coats of\r\nconservative white or buff paint.\r\n\r\nTEMVIK, =242.5 m.= (1,925 alt., 75 pop.), is a small Russo-German\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nLINTON, =251 m.= (1,706 alt., 1,192 pop.), was named for George W.\r\nLynn, an early settler. Protected by high, flat-topped hills, the\r\ntown is in a valley at the confluence of Beaver and Spring Creeks.\r\nThe most prominent building in town is the EMMONS COUNTY COURTHOUSE,\r\nof modern design, constructed of North Dakota brick. Hand carving\r\non the spandrels above the first floor windows depicts the story of\r\nprogress in Emmons County. Several of the public buildings in Linton,\r\nincluding the hospital and the Episcopal church, are constructed of\r\nnative sandstone quarried a short distance from the town. SEEMAN'S PARK\r\n(_picnicking, swimming, camping_) on Beaver Creek, named for L. D.\r\nSeeman, its donor, is a recreation and tourist camp.\r\n\r\nRight from Linton on an improved county dirt road to the junction with\r\nan unimproved road, =0.5 m.=; L. on this prairie road, unsuitable\r\nfor trailers, to what appears to be an almost perfect specimen of an\r\nINDIAN TURTLE EFFIGY MOUND, =1.5 m.= The road passes directly over the\r\nturtle's back, and from the top of the mound the outlines of the head\r\nto the E. and the tail to the W. are clearly visible.\r\n\r\nSTRASBURG, =262 m.= (1,800 alt., 695 pop.), gets its typically German\r\nname from a German settlement in Russia whence many of its settlers\r\ncame. It marks the dividing line between the Russo-German and Dutch\r\nsettlements of this vicinity. Both racial groups make up the population\r\nof the town, which is the center of a large grain and dairy area.\r\nRising from the compact little village is the double spire of the\r\nRoman Catholic church, which is attended by the largest rural Catholic\r\ncongregation in the State. The feast day of SS. Peter and Paul (_June\r\n29_) is an annual occasion for celebration.\r\n\r\nSouth of Strasburg the route passes through territory settled by\r\nHollanders, and the landscape is dotted with their neat, well-kept\r\nfarms. Although many of them are American-born, the native tongue is\r\nretained in their homes. The Dutch Reformed Church forms the focal\r\npoint in their communities; many of their children attend college at\r\nHolland, Mich., and members of the settlement annually go to Michigan\r\nfor the Holland Tulip Festival.\r\n\r\nHULL, =270.5 m.= (1,800 alt., 50 pop.), is one of the Dutch\r\ncommunities, named for Hull, Iowa.\r\n\r\nAt =272.5 m.= is the junction with ND 11, a graveled highway.\r\n\r\nLeft on this highway is HAGUE, =5 m.= (1,899 alt., 125 pop.), named for\r\nThe Hague in the Netherlands. In a level farming area, it is one of\r\nthe market towns for the Dutch settlements, although its population is\r\nprincipally Russo-German. The Roman Catholic church is the outstanding\r\nbuilding of the community.\r\n\r\nUS 83 crosses the North Dakota-South Dakota boundary at =278.5 m.=, 141\r\nm. N. of Pierre, S. Dak. (_see S. Dak. Tour 12_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIDE TOUR 3A\r\n\r\n\r\n  Junction US 83--Garrison--Nishu--Elbowoods--Shell Creek--Van\r\n  Hook--Stanley.

Lignite is mined in the surrounding country.\r\n\r\nAt =20 m.= is the junction with ND 28 and a county graveled highway.\r\nStraight ahead on the county highway to a small store and filling\r\nstation, where is the junction with an unimproved dirt road, =29\r\nm.=; L. to enter the FORT BERTHOLD INDIAN RESERVATION at =33 m.=\r\nEstablished in 1870 with an area of more than 2,000,000 acres, it\r\nhas now been reduced to 625,000. The region is principally rugged\r\nand broken--typical Badlands, best suited for grazing, although the\r\neastern portion of the reservation contains some good farming land. The\r\npopulation figures for 1936 list 600 Arikara, 711 Hidatsa, and 337\r\nMandans (although few of the latter are of pure blood), remnants of the\r\nthree agricultural Indian tribes that once occupied the Missouri River\r\nValley.\r\n\r\nAt =38 m.= is the junction with a dirt road, not suitable for trailers.\r\n\r\nLeft on this road to the junction with another dirt road, =3 m.=; R.\r\non this road to another junction at =4 m.=; L. to another junction\r\nat =5 m.=; R. to a fence gate, =5.8 m.=; R. through the gate, pass a\r\nsmall farmhouse to the SITE OF FORT BERTHOLD, =6 m.= Above the river\r\nbottoms, overlooking a bend in the Missouri's course, are the ruins\r\nof a trading post built in 1845 by Bartholomew Berthold, a Tyrolese.\r\nHe had traded in the river country for many years, and his success at\r\nthis new fort named for him made it one of the most important Missouri\r\nRiver posts. Harassed by the warlike Sioux, the Hidatsa Indians left\r\ntheir village at the mouth of the Knife River and came to live at Fort\r\nBerthold, where, because of the bend in the river, they named their\r\nnew home Like-a-fish-hook Village. The Mandan Indians later joined the\r\nHidatsa at this site. From the first the history of Fort Berthold is a\r\ntale of many assaults by wandering parties of Sioux. In 1864 a portion\r\nof the second Sully expedition was sent to protect the outpost, and the\r\nfollowing year Fort Berthold became a military post. It was garrisoned\r\nuntil 1867, when Fort Stevenson, 12 m. E., replaced it. The rough-hewn\r\nlog buildings which Berthold and his men erected were later replaced by\r\nframe buildings, the dismantled remains and cellars of which are all\r\nthat mark the site today.\r\n\r\nThe GRAVES OF SON-OF-THE-STAR AND WHITE SHIELD, famed Arikara chiefs,\r\nare marked by a cement monument about 250 yd. NW. of the fort site.\r\nBoth chiefs were friendly to the white men and helped them in their\r\nconquest of the region. Son-of-the-Star was head of the Arikara tribe\r\nduring the trying times with the Sioux in 1876, and through his\r\nreputation for gentleness and a lofty sense of justice stood high in\r\nthe estimation of both red and white leaders. The two graves are sacred\r\nto the Arikara Indians.\r\n\r\nA few yards SW. of the monument are the graves of more than 100 Indians\r\nof the reservation who served as scouts or enlisted as soldiers with\r\nthe U. S. Army since the founding of the reservation in 1870. The white\r\nmarble slabs marking the individual graves stand in precise rows as an\r\narmy quietly at salute. Each Memorial Day the American Legion posts of\r\nElbowoods (Indian) and Garrison (white) hold joint services here.\r\n\r\nAt =39 m.= is the junction with a dirt road, rutted and winding; not\r\nsuitable for trailers.\r\n\r\nLeft on this road to the MISSOURI RIVER, =2 m.=, known to the Mandans\r\nas Mata (_division between two parts of land_), and to the Hidatsa as\r\nAnati (_navigable water filled with earth_). A ferry (_65c per car, 10c\r\nper person_) crosses the river. Here in the area adjacent to the route\r\nlive the Mandan Indians. Left to BEAVER CREEK STORE, =6 m.=, a tiny\r\ntrading post known locally as Ree. Right to the JAMES HOLDING EAGLE\r\nFARM, =12 m.=, typical of the modern Mandan home, and far removed from\r\nthe earth lodges used by the Indians a century ago.\r\n\r\nAbout 200 ft. L. of the farm is a circular depression believed by the\r\nMandans to be the SITE OF GRANDMOTHER'S LODGE. Grandmother, according\r\nto legend, is The-Woman-Who-Never-Dies. She built her home on the first\r\nbench of the river, and on the bottom land below planted her vast\r\ncornfield, which the deer and blackbirds helped her cultivate. She now\r\nlives in the moon, where prayers for favorable weather for crops are\r\naddressed to her.\r\n\r\nWithin the hollow of the lodge site is what appears to be an ordinary\r\ngranite boulder. Beneath its edges are often found coins of large and\r\nsmall denominations, given as offerings for good crops. The Mandans say\r\nthat many offerings are left by members of the Crow tribe of Montana,\r\ndistantly related to the Hidatsa. It is told that an earth girl married\r\nthe Man-From-the-Sky and went to live with him, but became homesick for\r\nthe earth, and attempted to leave the sky on a cord of buffalo hide.\r\nHer husband discovered her hanging by the cord, and, angered by her\r\ninfidelity, threw a boulder at her. The rock crushed her to earth, and\r\ntoday lies where it fell, in the circle of Grandmother's Lodge.\r\n\r\nAt =39.8 m.= is NISHU (Arikara, _arrow_), community center of the\r\nArikara (Ree) tribe. The few buildings of the community are scattered\r\nacross the level land between the river lowlands and the hills to the\r\nN. Of particular interest is the circular log dance hall or MEDICINE\r\nLODGE. At the appropriate seasons of the year are held the ancient\r\ntribal ceremonies pertaining to the successful conduct of agricultural\r\nand personal pursuits. In front of the medicine lodge is the boulder\r\nwhich plays a prominent part in the annual cedar-tree ceremonial, a New\r\nYear ritual usually held sometime in August. The cedar and the boulder\r\nrepresent the Grandfather and Grandmother of the tribe, and the tree\r\nis left standing beside the boulder until spring, when it is decorated\r\nwith children's moccasins and placed on the ice of the Missouri. When\r\nthe ice goes out the tree is borne downstream, to carry greetings\r\nfrom the Arikara to their old village sites down the river. Other\r\nceremonials of religious significance include the Mother Corn ritual,\r\nthe sage dance of thanksgiving, and medicine ceremonies. Since they\r\nare seasonal, no set date can be given for these occasions (_usually\r\nopen to public_). Arikara beadwork and other articles of handicraft are\r\nsometimes available at the store in Nishu.\r\n\r\nAt =40 m.= the route turns R. and follows the only telephone line on\r\nthe reservation. The steep rolling country is occupied mainly by the\r\nArikara. Their farm homes are usually white frame buildings, although\r\noccasionally there is a poorer log house. There are few barns on these\r\nfarms; the Indians seldom have milk cows, and they let their horses run\r\non the range throughout the entire year.\r\n\r\nAt =54 m.= is the junction with ND 8, a graded dirt road; straight\r\nahead on this is SACRED HEART MISSION, =54.5 m.=, a Roman Catholic\r\nchurch and mission school established in 1889.\r\n\r\nLeft from the mission on a road lined with towering cottonwoods is\r\nELBOWOODS, =0.5 m.= (1,770 alt., 135 pop.), agency headquarters for the\r\nreservation. Its name is derived from the elbow bend of the timber belt\r\nalong the Missouri at that point. The town centers about the square\r\nof agency lawn. Most of the population is white. The town was settled\r\nin 1891 when the agency was established. In addition to its regular\r\ngovernmental functions, the agency operates a non-profit flour mill\r\nand conducts an experimental farm to educate the Indians in modern\r\nagricultural methods. Despite this, many Indians lease their farming\r\nlands to white people. What is now the GOVERNMENT SCHOOL was built in\r\n1876 as the Congregational mission, the first on the reservation.\r\n\r\nJust SW. of the town are the Indian FAIRGROUNDS where three-day\r\ncelebrations, with rodeos and tribal dances, are held each year (_July\r\nor Aug._).\r\n\r\nND 8 at =55 m.= passes SCATTER VILLAGE, a little group of filling\r\nstations and garages that grew up around the approach to the highway\r\nbridge across the Missouri.\r\n\r\nAt =56.5 m.= is the junction (R) with a dirt reservation road, on which\r\nthe route continues.\r\n\r\nLeft on ND 8 to FOUR BEARS BRIDGE, =1 m.=, the bridge with 19 names.\r\nWhen it was built, the Mandans wished it named for their chief Four\r\nBears, subject of many paintings by the artist Catlin who visited this\r\nsection more than a century ago. The Hidatsa wished it named for their\r\nchief Four Bears, who died a few years before the bridge was built.\r\nBecause of these tribal jealousies it was decided to name the southern\r\nend of the bridge for the Mandan chief, and the northern end for the\r\nHidatsa chief. At each end of the span is a plaque bearing the names\r\nof chiefs of both tribes given as associate titles to the bridge: for\r\nthe Mandans there are Charging Eagle, Red Buffalo Cow, Flying Eagle,\r\nBlack Eagle, and Waterchief; for the Hidatsa, Poor Wolf, Porcupine,\r\nCrow Paunch, Big Brave, Crow-Flies-High, Big Hawk, and Old Dog. This\r\narrangement proved unsatisfactory to the Arikara, and a partial\r\ncompromise was effected by adding the names of five of their chiefs,\r\nBear Chief, Son-of-the-Star, White Shield, Peter Beauchamp, Sr., and\r\nBobtail Bull, as associates.\r\n\r\nThe dirt reservation road proceeds NW. along the river lowlands, enters\r\na reservation timber reserve at =60.5 m.=, and skirts the eastern\r\nwooded shore of the Missouri before rising again to the benchland. At\r\n=68 m.= is a store and filling station. The route now passes through\r\nthe area occupied by the Hidatsa, also known as the Minitari or Gros\r\nVentres (Fr., _big bellies_). Their homes are much like those of the\r\nother two tribes. The Hidatsa and the Crow Indians of Montana at one\r\ntime were a single tribe. During a period of want one winter in the\r\neighteenth century, a buffalo was killed by the tribe, and the animal\r\nsatisfactorily divided until they came to the stomach. The division\r\nof this organ led to a quarrel which split the group, and one faction\r\nmoved W. and became the Crow tribe.\r\n\r\nSHELL CREEK, =79 m.=, is the Hidatsa community center. A few stores, a\r\ndance hall, a handful of dwellings, and the central agency experimental\r\nfarm make up the town.\r\n\r\nAt =82 m.=, N. of Shell Creek, is the reservation boundary.\r\n\r\nNorth of the boundary is VAN HOOK, =89 m.= (1,843 alt., 372 pop.),\r\nnamed for a teamster who served the railroad surveyors. It is one of\r\nthe trade points adjacent to the reservation and has the only creamery\r\nin the vicinity, a $20,000 cooperative plant. Here is a junction with\r\nND 8.\r\n\r\nNorth of Van Hook on ND 8 is BELDEN, =104 m.= (2,250 alt., 25 pop.),\r\nthe center of a settlement of Finnish people who homesteaded here in\r\n1903-4. The Finnish tongue is used in most of their homes, and they\r\nalso have the _sauna_ or steam bath without which no Finnish community\r\nis complete. The peculiar European three-cornered head scarf is still\r\nworn by many of the women. Most of the people have been naturalized and\r\nare greatly interested in political trends. About one-third of them\r\nare members of the United Farmers and Workers League of America, an\r\norganization professing communistic doctrines. The radical views and\r\nintensive political activity of these members of the community have\r\nearned it a reputation as the communistic center of North Dakota.\r\n\r\nAt =117 m.= is the junction with US 2 at STANLEY (_see Tour 6_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIDE TOUR 3B\r\n\r\n\r\n  Junction US 83--Junction US 10. County dirt and graveled roads,\r\n  \"The River Road.\"\r\n\r\n  Junction with US 83 to junction with US 10, 35 m.\r\n\r\n  Dry-weather dirt road except for 6 m. gravel between =29 m.= and US\r\n  10.\r\n\r\n  Drive carefully as route is hilly with many curves. Route parallels\r\n  Missouri River.\r\n\r\nThe River Road between Washburn and Bismarck approximates the overland\r\nfreighter trail established in the early 1870's between the end of the\r\nNorthern Pacific Railway at Bismarck and Fort Buford near the mouth of\r\nthe Yellowstone.\r\n\r\nLewis and Clark, when they came up the Missouri River on their\r\nhistory-making expedition in 1804-5, sent outriders along this side\r\nof the river. Along much the same route the freighter trail was\r\nestablished in 1873 when the Northern Pacific brought to Bismarck goods\r\ndestined for Forts Stevenson, Berthold, and Buford, and this soon\r\nbecame the main-traveled highway for soldiers, traders, and later for\r\nranchers and settlers. Today ruts cut into the prairie by heavily laden\r\nwagons, plodding ox teams, and flying hoofs of couriers' horses are\r\nstill visible in many places along the road.\r\n\r\nThe route is one of the most attractive in the State as it follows the\r\nwinding, wooded course of the Missouri where the high hills and buttes\r\nalong the river's edge contrast with the green meadows and wooded\r\nlowlands of the river bottom. This region was once the home of three\r\nMissouri Valley Indian tribes--Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara--and the\r\nroute passes three Mandan village sites.\r\n\r\nThe route branches W. from US 83 (_see Tour 3_) 10 m. N. of Wilton on a\r\ncounty dirt road.\r\n\r\nAt =2 m.= is the junction with a dirt road.\r\n\r\nRight on this road to WILDWOOD LAKE, =1 m.=, in an old channel of\r\nthe Missouri. The permanent summer camp of the Missouri Valley Area\r\nCouncil, Boy Scouts of America, is on the eastern shore of the lake.\r\n\r\nAt =13 m.= a large farmhouse and a decrepit log hut with a sod roof (L)\r\nmark the site of Painted Woods Post Office, one of the early Missouri\r\nRiver settlements. Between the old post office and the river are the\r\nPAINTED WOODS, so named by the Indians. According to legend, the woods\r\nwere a neutral ground between hostile tribes until a Mandan girl fell\r\nin love with a Yanktonai Sioux warrior. She planned to leave her people\r\nand go with him, but her kinsmen slew him in her embrace; as she knelt\r\nby his bier, avenging Yanktonai arrows pierced her. The two tribes\r\nbegan a bitter warfare. The bodies of the lovers were placed in the\r\nbranches of a tree in the woods, and the tree soon withered and became\r\nwhite and bleached, like the bones in its branches. Yanktonai warriors,\r\ncoming to the woods to paint their faces and prepare for battle,\r\nboastfully portrayed their victories on the tree, and in retaliation\r\nthe Mandans painted the surrounding trees with war paint to mock their\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nAt =19 m.= is the junction with a dirt road.\r\n\r\nRight on this road to HALF MOON MANDAN INDIAN VILLAGE SITE (also known\r\nas the Larson site), =1 m.=, unusual in that a ditch, still visible,\r\napparently divided the site in two parts and yet offered no means of\r\ndefense. A sunken area in the site may have been the village square,\r\nand the circular hollows of the earth lodges are still visible in some\r\nplaces despite cultivation of the vicinity.\r\n\r\nSQUARE BUTTES, early landmarks, raise their flat-topped heights across\r\nthe river near the Larson site, and dominate the landscape for the\r\nnext 10 m. Their odd beauty, contrasting with the graceful slopes\r\nof surrounding hills, has appealed to both red men and white. George\r\nCatlin, the artist and explorer who spent eight years in this region\r\nmore than a century ago, painted a good oil of the Square Buttes.\r\n\r\nAt =22 m.= is the junction with a trail (L).\r\n\r\nUp the steep bluffs here to DOUBLE DITCH INDIAN VILLAGE STATE PARK.\r\nArcheologically designated as the Burgois site, it is also known to the\r\nIndians as the ancient Village of Yellow Clay. The inner ditch of the\r\ntwo from which the site receives its name is still traceable in its\r\nentire course. The journals of the early French explorer, Verendrye,\r\ntell that the village was surrounded by a rampart and protected by\r\nan 18-foot palisade and a ditch 18 ft. wide and 15 ft, deep. The\r\ncup-shaped depressions of the earth lodges, still visible, are as\r\nlarge as 40 ft. in diameter. Excavations made here by the Peabody\r\nMuseum, Harvard University, disclosed fine specimens of agricultural\r\nimplements, religious pieces, and artifacts of warfare. Positions of\r\nhuman skeletons found in the excavations indicate that shallow burial\r\nwas the custom of the Mandans occupying the site.\r\n\r\nAt =33 m.= the River Road passes through PIONEER PARK. On the flood\r\nplain of the Missouri, between BURNT CREEK and the road, a picnic and\r\ncamp ground (_rustic shelters, tables, benches, chairs_) has been built\r\namong the towering cottonwood trees.\r\n\r\nAt =33 m.= is a junction with a winding gravel road.\r\n\r\nLeft on this road to the top of the sheer bluffs to LOOKING VILLAGE,\r\n=0.5 m.=, Mandan site named for Chief Looking. Now part of Pioneer\r\nPark, the village is known as the Ward site, and several of the earth\r\nlodges have been reconstructed under a CCC project. The natural\r\ndefenses of this village were exceptional. On a level, circular summit\r\nalmost completely cut off from the surrounding benchland, its eastern\r\nside was well protected by a ditch, still visible, and a wall. To the\r\nN., where the hill is less steep, a ditch and wall were also means of\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nBuilt-in log steps and a graded path lead up a round knoll overlooking\r\nthe river. On the western slope of this formation is a large granite\r\nboulder believed to be a petroglyph, or picture rock, of some religious\r\nsignificance. Close observation of the rock will reveal many small,\r\nround impressions that may be a form of rock-writing known as cup\r\nsculpture. From this point, and from the parking spaces near the Indian\r\nvillage site, is a beautiful view up and down the Missouri.\r\n\r\nAt =34 m.=, almost in the long shadows of the railroad bridge, Burnt\r\nCreek drains into the Missouri. A story related by Joseph Henry Taylor\r\nin his writings tells that, in the summer of 1863, 24 white people,\r\nincluding a woman, a small girl, and a baby, were killed here by the\r\nSioux, and nearly $90,000 in gold dust strewn on the banks of the\r\nriver. The white people had spent the winter mining at Bannock, Mont.,\r\nand were returning east with their gold carried in belts and hidden in\r\nholes drilled in their flat-bottomed mackinaw boat. Stopping at Fort\r\nBerthold on their journey down the Missouri, they were warned by the\r\ntrader, F. F. Gerard, that it was unsafe to continue until a large\r\ngroup was ready to make the trip through the territory occupied by the\r\nhostile Sioux. Thinking Gerard only wished to sell them supplies at\r\nhigh prices, the party disregarded his advice. This was shortly after\r\nGeneral Sibley had pursued the Sioux across the Missouri. The Indians,\r\nhowever, following the departure of the military forces, had returned\r\nto the east side of the river, as game was more plentiful there, and\r\na party was camped on Burnt Creek. The ever changing Missouri had\r\ncut a long sand bar near the creek mouth, forming a narrow, shallow\r\nchannel between the shore and mid-river. On this bar an old Sisseton\r\nwas fishing as the white men's boat floated into sight. In a gesture of\r\nfriendliness the old man waved the boat away from the shallow channel,\r\nbut his motion was mistaken for a signal, and the white men shot him.\r\nIndian women bathing at the river's edge ran screaming to their camp,\r\nbringing the warriors. The party of whites had a small cannon on board,\r\nand with it killed many of the Indians. The recoil of the cannon fire,\r\nhowever, sank the boat in the shallow water, and after the leader of\r\nthe white party had been shot the Sioux swarmed on board and disposed\r\nof the others. They found the gold dust, but, thinking it only yellow\r\nclay, scattered it on the sands. It was several days later that Gerard\r\nheard of the massacre and sent a party of 10 Mandans, headed by his\r\nbrother-in-law Whistling Bear, to recover the gold. They scooped up\r\napproximately $70,000 worth in a coffeepot found in the boat, for which\r\nGerard gave a fine horse and a few small presents to Whistling Bear,\r\nand a feast to his helpers. The gold thought to be hidden in the hull\r\nof the boat was never recovered, although several attempts were made by\r\nfortune hunters in later years.\r\n\r\nAt =35 m.= is the junction with US 10 (_see Tour 8_) just L. of Liberty\r\nMemorial Bridge, 1 m. W. of Bismarck (_see_ BISMARCK).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOUR 4\r\n\r\n\r\n  (Moosejaw, Sask., Can.)--Ambrose--Belfield--Amidon--Bowman--(Belle\r\n  Fourche, S. Dak.). US 85.\r\n\r\n  Canadian boundary to South Dakota Line, 264.5 m.\r\n\r\n  G. N. Ry. branch line roughly parallels route between Alexander and\r\n  Watford City.\r\n\r\n  Graveled roadbed except for 7 m. bituminous surface, 40 m. graded\r\n  dirt highway, and 16 m. unimproved dirt road.\r\n\r\n  Accommodations in principal towns.\r\n\r\nUS 85, a direct route through western North Dakota between Saskatchewan\r\nand the South Dakota Line, traverses the Coteau du Plateau du Missouri,\r\ncrosses the Missouri River, and enters the severe, majestically\r\nbeautiful region of the Missouri Slope with its expansive range country\r\nand scenic Badlands. Between the Canadian border and the Missouri,\r\nboulder-strewn, smoothly rounded hills are evidence of glaciation. In\r\nthe rough country along the Missouri and Little Missouri Rivers, the\r\nhigh, mesa-like buttes, flat-topped and capped with thick layers of\r\nrock, mark the level of the land before it was worn by ages of erosion.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that men have been equal at only three times since\r\ncreation--once in the Garden of Eden, once in the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, and once in the \"cow country\" before the fence. When\r\nwhite settlers were just beginning to invade these wide plains and\r\nrough Badlands, cattle were being driven here from the Texas Panhandle.\r\nThe famous Chisholm Trail that ran north from Texas to Abilene, Kans.,\r\nhad many branching trails, one of which ran through the area now\r\ntraversed by US 85. In 1934, when P. P. Ackley of Elk City, Okla., an\r\nold southwestern cattleman, marked the Chisholm Trail he included this\r\nnorthern branch.\r\n\r\nUS 85 crosses the Canadian boundary 11 m. S. of Torquay, Sask., Canada.\r\n\r\nAt =0.0 m.= are clustered the small buildings of the customs office and\r\nthe border patrol.\r\n\r\nAMBROSE, =3 m.= (2,060 alt., 334 pop.), named for a Soo Line\r\nright-of-way employee, in its early history was one of the greatest\r\nprimary grain markets in the Northwest. With five elevators, and many\r\nhawkers buying on the track, as many as 300 grain wagons often crowded\r\nthe streets, sometimes remaining several days before they could deliver\r\ntheir loads. Before the railway was extended W. of Ambrose, the town\r\nwas a shipping point for horses, sheep, and cattle from the ranch\r\ncountry of eastern Montana and western North Dakota. Ambrose has two\r\nparks and a swimming pool.\r\n\r\nAt =6.5 m.= is a junction with ND 5, a graveled highway (_see Tour 5_),\r\nwhich unites with US 85 between this point and =16.5 m.= where US 85\r\nbranches L.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of ZAHL, =39.5 m.= (2,000 alt., 153 pop.), are many\r\nsmall underground lignite mines that supply local markets and truckers.\r\nThe town is named for F. R. Zahl, who came to this region in the early\r\n1870's and became an outstanding buffalo hunter. The first post office\r\nhere was at his ranch, E. of the present town. ND 50, a graveled\r\nhighway (_see Side Tour 4A_), unites with US 85 between Zahl and =43.5\r\nm.=, where US 85 branches R.\r\n\r\nSouth of Zahl the route parallels the wide, flat-bottomed trough formed\r\nby LITTLE MUDDY CREEK. At =63 m.= is the junction with US 2 (_see Tour\r\n6_), and the two highways are one route to =77.5 m.=, where US 85\r\nbranches L.\r\n\r\nAt =79 m.= the route crosses the MISSOURI RIVER on the LEWIS AND CLARK\r\nBRIDGE, built in 1927, the second bridge in the State to span the\r\nBig Muddy. Natural gas from the Baker, Mont. field is piped into the\r\nWilliston territory through lines that cross the bridge.\r\n\r\nSouth of the bridge the highway winds through the draws and ravines\r\nof the Little Badlands, a small area showing the results of severe\r\nerosion. At =96.5 m.= is the junction with a county improved road.\r\n\r\nRight on this road is CARTWRIGHT, =13.5 m.= (1,896 alt., 75 pop.),\r\nnamed for Samuel George Cartwright, the hunter-trapper who was its\r\nfirst settler. At =17 m.= is the YELLOWSTONE RIVER, the largest\r\ntributary of the Missouri, and an important factor in the history of\r\nexploration, settlement, and development of trade in Montana. Here,\r\nwhere the river joins the Missouri just within the North Dakota border,\r\nthe valley once was a hunting paradise for the upper Missouri Indians,\r\nbut fur traders, trappers, hunters, and settlers gave little thought to\r\nconservation, and the big game is now extinct. The three-million-dollar\r\nirrigation project completed in 1909 by the Federal Bureau of\r\nReclamation has brought the region the title of Prosperous Valley.\r\nSugar beets form the principal crop, although grains, vegetables, and\r\nforage crops are raised successfully, and there is some small-scale\r\nfruit farming. Center of the sugar industry is the refining plant at\r\nSidney, Mont. (_see Mont. Tour 9_). The entire irrigated area contains\r\n58,561 acres, of which 19,500 are in North Dakota. Sugar-beet acreage\r\nin the Yellowstone Valley in this State is approximately 1,800. Mexican\r\nlabor is used in the beet fields; most of the Mexicans make their homes\r\nin the Sidney and Fairview, Mont. (_see below_) areas.\r\n\r\nThe Yellowstone can be crossed here on the G. N. Ry. bridge, on which\r\ntimber planking has been placed over the ties to permit automobile\r\ntraffic. In one span of the bridge is a vertical lift to allow passage\r\nof river boats, although these are much more scarce than they were when\r\nthe bridge was built in 1913.\r\n\r\nJust E. of the bridge is the only railroad tunnel in the State, a\r\n1,456-foot timber-supported excavation piercing the soft earth hills\r\nbordering the Yellowstone. It serves a single track on a curved\r\nalignment of three degrees.\r\n\r\nAt =21.5 m.= the road crosses the Montana Line at the city limits of\r\nFairview, Mont. (_see Mont. Tour 9_).\r\n\r\nALEXANDER, =98.5 m.= (2,146 alt., 386 pop.), was platted in 1905\r\nshortly after organization of McKenzie County by special legislative\r\nact, and was designated temporary county seat by proclamation of\r\nGovernor Sarles. Alexander McKenzie, political dictator of the early\r\nDakota scene, was one of the town site incorporators, and both the\r\ntown and county are named for him. Still standing is the old log\r\nbuilding that served as the first county courthouse.\r\n\r\nARNEGARD, =110.5 m.= (2,237 alt., 254 pop.), was named for Evan\r\nArnegard, an early settler. The community is predominantly\r\nScandinavian. Certified potatoes, both for southern markets and\r\nfoundation stock for growers in the eastern part of the State, form one\r\nof the leading products of the surrounding agricultural area. Turkeys\r\nare also raised here.\r\n\r\n1. Left from Arnegard on a graded road =2 m.=; L. here to LAKE PESHECK,\r\n=3 m.=, formed by impounded creek waters. It is surrounded by fine\r\ntrees, and is fast becoming a summer recreation point. The lake was\r\nrecently stocked with 1,500 trout.\r\n\r\n2. Right from Arnegard on a dirt road to the northern entrance of the\r\nNORTH ROOSEVELT REGIONAL STATE PARK, =14 m.= (_see_ NORTH ROOSEVELT\r\nREGIONAL STATE PARK).\r\n\r\nWATFORD CITY, =117.5 m.= (2,082 alt., 769 pop.), was named for a town\r\nin Canada. Because of lack of facilities at Schafer, the neighboring\r\ncounty seat, Watford City is actually, if not legally, the seat of the\r\ncounty government. Many of the county officers and employees live here,\r\nand county and Federal agencies have offices in the city.\r\n\r\nThe town is the terminus of a G. N. Ry. branch line, and the trade\r\ncenter of the \"Island Empire\" county, so called because the Missouri on\r\nthe N. and E., the Yellowstone on the W., and the Little Missouri on\r\nthe S. almost surround it with water. At the W. A. Jacobson law office\r\nis a private MUSEUM (_open weekdays 9-5_), a collection of stones,\r\ngems, fossils, Indian artifacts, coins, woods, and other articles of\r\ninterest, including a Bible printed in 1535. A tourist camp is one-half\r\nmile E. on ND 23, a graveled highway.\r\n\r\nLeft from Watford City on ND 23 is SCHAFER, =4 m.= (1,950 alt., 100\r\npop.), seat of McKenzie County, in the little Cherry Creek valley (_see\r\nTour 10_). Its white frame buildings and dingy log huts cluster about\r\nthe frame courthouse which is an object of long-standing contention\r\nwith Watford City. The town is named for Charles Shafer (1850-1930), an\r\nearly rancher of the region, whose son George Shafer (1888-) served as\r\nGovernor of the State from 1929-32. On the Shafer homestead S. of the\r\ntown along the creek are the Schafer Springs, near which are excellent\r\ncamping grounds. The springs have a flow of nearly 6,000 gal. per\r\nhour, a flow which has not diminished during recent years of subnormal\r\nrainfall.\r\n\r\nA slight curve at =130.5 m.= reveals a spectacular view. The grassy\r\nplateau ends abruptly, and below, as though a huge, careless knife had\r\nslashed into the prairie, lies a confusion of endless gray-, ocher-,\r\nslate-, and red-layered buttes, through which winds a maze of ragged\r\nravines and coulees. In the distance the meandering LITTLE MISSOURI\r\nRIVER looks hardly capable of producing the strange BADLANDS which\r\nit and its tributaries have carved out of the earth. The red of the\r\nscoria-topped buttes, the myriad hues of the strata laid down ages ago\r\nby successive prehistoric seas, and the brilliant green of the spruce\r\nand cedar trees clinging to the steep hillsides form a startling,\r\nalmost weird, picture.\r\n\r\nLike miniatures at the bottom of the valley are the silvery steel\r\nof the ROOSEVELT BRIDGE and the drab, squat, frame buildings of a\r\npermanent CCC camp. In 3 m. the tortuous, twisting highway drops 600\r\nft. (_drive carefully_) to reach the CCC camp and the main entrance\r\nto the North Roosevelt Regional State Park at =133.5 m.= (_see_ NORTH\r\nROOSEVELT REGIONAL STATE PARK).\r\n\r\nAfter crossing the river and its wide flood plain the highway climbs\r\nthrough the Badlands to emerge upon the prairie at =137 m.= In the\r\ndistance (L) at =143 m.= are the Killdeer Mountains (_see Side Tour\r\n8D_).\r\n\r\nAt =151 m.= the highway rounds a grass-covered prominence to enter\r\nGRASSY BUTTE (2,300 alt., 40 pop.), a little town founded in 1913 and\r\nnamed for the neighboring butte, which has long been a landmark in the\r\nregion. Although there are many similarly shaped elevations in the\r\nvicinity, Grassy Butte is the only one not bare of vegetation. Ten\r\nRussian laborers first homesteaded in the Grassy Butte region, forming\r\nthe nucleus of the present-day farming population. The old post office\r\nbuilding still stands, a typical frontier log structure. In the early\r\ndays of the town, when there were buildings on only one side of the\r\nmain street, it was a local jest that Grassy Butte had the widest main\r\nstreet in the country, \"from McKenzie County to the Atlantic seaboard.\"\r\n\r\nThe people who inhabit the area surrounding Grassy Butte are Little\r\nRussians or Ukrainians. They preserve many of their Old Country\r\ncustoms, and retain their Greek Catholic religious allegiance, though a\r\ndifference of opinion has resulted in a schism.\r\n\r\nA wedding custom of these people requires that the bride and bridegroom\r\nreturn to their respective homes after the marriage ceremony. At\r\nmidnight a delegation representing the bridegroom abducts the bride and\r\nbrings her to her husband's home. Wedding celebrations often last two\r\nor three days.\r\n\r\nAt =155.5 m.= is the junction with ND 25 (_see Side Tour 8D_).\r\n\r\nAt BELFIELD, =190 m.=, is the junction with US 10 (_see Tour 8_).\r\n\r\nAt =213.5 m.= is the junction with ND 21 (_see Side Tour 4B_).\r\n\r\nAt =222.5 m.= is the junction with a graded dirt road, not suitable for\r\ntrailers.\r\n\r\nLeft on this road to CHALKY BUTTE, also known as White Butte, =6 m.=,\r\na long high butte topped with one of the few White River limestone\r\nformations in the State. On its steep talus-covered slopes fossilized\r\nteeth and bones of prehistoric animals have been found. Outcroppings of\r\nlarge bones are plainly visible in the limestone cliff. The complete\r\nskull and other bones of an oreodon (small prehistoric hoofed animal)\r\nhave been taken from this fossil bed.\r\n\r\nIn early days of white settlement it was believed that a treasure was\r\nburied somewhere on Chalky Butte because an Indian chief often went\r\nthere and returned with gold. Although he was followed, he always\r\nmanaged to elude his pursuers; his cache, if it existed, has never been\r\nfound. According to another story, a small party of soldiers once left\r\nFort Meade, in the Black Hills, to take the pay roll to Fort Keogh,\r\nMont. The pay roll never reached Fort Keogh, and no trace was found of\r\nthe men, unless the three revolvers marked \"U.S.\" and several U. S.\r\nArmy wagon irons with charred pieces of wood clinging to them, found\r\nabout 1900 near Sunset Butte S. of here, were the remains of their\r\nluckless expedition. Whether or not there is any connection between\r\nthese two stories is a matter of conjecture.\r\n\r\nAMIDON, =223.5 m.= (2,800 alt., 141 pop.), named for a U. S. district\r\njudge, Charles F. Amidon (1856-1937), was organized in 1915 and shortly\r\nthereafter was selected Slope County seat. In an enclosure near one of\r\nthe filling stations in the town is an 8-ton petrified stump almost 6\r\nft. in diameter, which was uncovered on the county fairgrounds N. of\r\nAmidon. The town commands a good view of the surrounding country, with\r\nChalky Butte to the SE., the angular outlines of the Badlands to the N.\r\nand W., and Black Butte (_see below_), highest point in the State, to\r\nthe SW.\r\n\r\nAt =225 m.= is the junction with a graded dirt road with sharp curves\r\nand abrupt hills (_unsuited for trailers_).\r\n\r\nRight on this road =2 m.=; then L. across rolling range land, gradually\r\ndescending into the Badlands to the junction with a little-used trail,\r\n=11 m.=\r\n\r\nRight on this trail =1 m.= at the end of a small valley are the BURNING\r\nCOAL MINE and the COLUMNAR CEDARS. Across the ravine on a hillside\r\nsloping to the W. is the burning mine, which at dusk casts a carmine\r\nglow over the hill, and a heavy odor of coal gas hangs in the little\r\nvalley. How long the lignite bed has been burning underground is not\r\nknown. The Indians have legends telling of the burning ground, and old\r\nsettlers in the region say that the burned area has not advanced more\r\nthan a few hundred feet in the 50 years since the region was first\r\nsettled by white men. The cause of the combustion is not known. As the\r\ncoal burns underneath, the earth overburden crumbles and falls, taking\r\nwith it all rocks, trees, and vegetation on the surface, leaving in its\r\nwake red scoria and other less brightly colored clays. The burned area\r\nsuccumbs easily to weathering and erosion. From large crevices in the\r\nearth intense heat pours, but with care one can peer into the flaming\r\nunderground pits. (_Approach from the downhill side where there is no\r\ndanger of the earth crumbling underfoot._)\r\n\r\nIn the bottom of the tiny valley, and on its western slope, grow the\r\ncolumnar cedars, bright green conical trees averaging 15 ft. in height.\r\nThese trees, found in North Dakota only in this small area adjacent\r\nto the burning mine, taper from a large base to a narrow tip. Their\r\nbrilliant green forms a decided contrast with the dull grays and tans\r\nof the hills surrounding them.\r\n\r\nOn the main side road beyond the junction with the trail, the dirt\r\ngraded road winds down to the Little Missouri and upstream to the\r\nSITE OF A LOGGING CAMP, =15 m.= When the N. P. Ry. was, being built\r\nW. of the Missouri a wood cutters' camp was maintained here. The camp\r\nbunkhouse is said to have been equipped with loopholes to shoot through\r\nin event of Indian attack. The cedar ties and pilings cut at the camp\r\nwere floated down the Little Missouri, but many became snagged in sand\r\nbars or scattered over the river flood plain, and few reached their\r\ndestination. Across the river from the site are the two peaks known as\r\nthe RABBIT'S EARS.\r\n\r\nUS 85 at =229 m.= passes directly between Chalky Butte (L) and Black\r\nButte (R).\r\n\r\nAt =230.5 m.= is a junction with a dirt road.\r\n\r\nRight on this road =1 m.= to an advantageous point from which to hike\r\nto the top of BLACK BUTTE (3,468 alt.), highest elevation in the State.\r\nThe butte is some 8 m. in circumference, and near the top solid rock\r\ncliffs rise perpendicularly 50 to 100 ft. above its grassy slopes. At\r\nits base lie huge boulders, broken from the sides by the action of\r\nweather. Springs form numerous creeks on the northern side, and their\r\ntree-and brush-lined banks are a favorite ground for berry-picking\r\nparties. At the northern corner of the butte is a hole about 3 ft.\r\nwide, from which a slight draught of air can be felt. When a pebble is\r\ndropped into this opening a dull thud can be heard, as though the stone\r\nhad not struck solid bottom. On the S. side of the butte is SNOW CAVE,\r\nwhere the deep winter snows often remain until August. There is a fine\r\nview from the top of the butte. At the western edge of the mesa are\r\ntwo rock-lined EAGLE PITS, about 4 ft. wide and 3 ft. deep, from which\r\nhidden Indians caught eagles and plucked out their tail feathers for\r\ntheir war bonnets. These quills were very valuable, often worth a pony\r\nin trade.\r\n\r\nBlack Butte is also known as H. T. Butte, since it was part of the H.\r\nT. ranch, which in the 1880's and 1890's was the largest horse ranch in\r\nthe State. The surrounding country in those days was given over to the\r\nranging of cattle, sheep, and horses, and it was not until the coming\r\nof the \"honyocks\", as the stockmen called the homesteaders, and the\r\ncultivation of former range lands, that the ranching of this section\r\nwas curtailed.\r\n\r\nConcerning H. T. Butte old-timers of this section tell a story of\r\na cowhand named Bob Pierce who because of his merciless riding was\r\nknown to his fellow workers as \"Crazy Loon\" as well as by numerous\r\nother uncomplimentary titles. He rode his mount at any speed anywhere,\r\nand it was hard to \"keep him in horses.\" It chanced that at one time\r\nBob was paired, on the circuit, with talkative old Colonel Sullers.\r\nThinking to harry the colonel, Bob began to spur his horse to breakneck\r\nspeed. Sullers kept beside him, holding up both ends of a political\r\nconversation and trying to pretend not to notice the speed. His horse,\r\nunfortunately, stepped into a hole, and the rider went sprawling.\r\nStopping at a nearby creek to wash the dirt and blood from his head\r\nand face, he reviled his tormentor, declaring, \"When you're dead your\r\nghost will ride the tops of the hills and howl like a gray wolf.\" In\r\nthe course of time Bob Pierce died, or he may have been killed on one\r\nof his wild rides. Since then, it is said, a horseman is seen, on dark\r\nnights, riding at breakneck speed up the steep, inaccessible sides of\r\nH. T. Butte, and sometimes the howl of a gray wolf is heard.\r\n\r\nBOWMAN, =248.5 m.= (2,958 alt., 888 pop.), seat of Bowman County,\r\nlies at the base of flat-topped, sandstone-capped TWIN BUTTES. Known\r\nsuccessively as Lowden Post Office and Twin Buttes, the town won the\r\ncounty seat election in a bitter fight with Atkinson (later Griffin)\r\nin 1907, and in January 1908 was given its present name. Both town and\r\ncounty are named for E. W. Bowman, a prominent Territorial legislator.\r\n\r\nThe junction with US 12 (_see Tour 9_) is in Bowman, and the two routes\r\nunite to =250 m.= where US 85 turns L. and reaches the South Dakota\r\nLine at =264.5 m.=, 103 m. N. of Belle Fourche, S. Dak. (_see S. Dak.\r\nTour 13_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIDE TOUR 4A\r\n\r\n\r\n  Junction US 85--Hanks--Grenora--Sodium Lakes--Writing Rock. ND 50\r\n  and unnumbered county roads.\r\n\r\n  Junction with US 85 to Writing Rock, 30.3 m.\r\n\r\n  G. N. Ry. parallels route between junction with US 85 and Grenora.\r\n  Graveled roadbed 12 m., graded dirt roads and prairie trail\r\n  remainder of route.\r\n\r\n  Accommodations in principal towns.\r\n\r\nThis short route passes through a region of boulder-strewn, smoothly\r\nrounded hills left by glacial action, and leads to extensive but\r\nundeveloped sodium sulphate beds and the archeologically important\r\nWriting Rock State Park. The populations of both towns on the route are\r\nchiefly Scandinavian; they were settled by immigrants who arrived with\r\nor shortly after the railroad.\r\n\r\nND 50 branches W. from US 85 (_see Tour 4_) at Zahl.\r\n\r\nHANKS, =5 m.= (2,114 alt., 213 pop.), named for W. F. Hanks, a Powers\r\nLake rancher and banker who was connected with the town site company,\r\nbegins its history with the arrival of the G. N. branch line in 1916.\r\nIn the 1890's the N-N (N Bar N) Cattle Co. of St. Louis, which ran\r\nherds of livestock S. of the Missouri River in central Montana, refused\r\nto ship their stock over the G. N. because of a disagreement with that\r\nline. As a result they had to trail their large herds many weary miles\r\nto the nearest Soo Line points, which were at Bowbells and Kenmare, N.\r\nDak. (_see Tour 7_). As many as 30,000 of these Chicago-bound cattle\r\npassed through Hanks in a single season on their way to the railroad,\r\nherded by dust-caked cowboys of the authentic, original, Wild West\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\nRanching was the chief industry of this section when it was first\r\nsettled, and there is still some small-scale ranching in the vicinity.\r\n\r\nGRENORA, =11 m.= (2,105 alt., 487 pop.), has a name derived from\r\nthe-first three letters of the words Great Northern, and as terminus of\r\nthat railroad enjoyed a brief boom in 1916.\r\n\r\nWest of Grenora ND 50 is a graded dirt road. At =14 m.= is the junction\r\nwith a county dirt road (R) which is now the route.\r\n\r\nAt =17 m.= is the junction with a prairie trail.\r\n\r\nLeft on this trail to FERTILE VALLEY LAKE NO. 2, =1 m.=, largest of\r\nthe several shallow lakes in this vicinity which contain millions of\r\ntons of sodium sulphate, a valuable mineral resource. These lakes and\r\nsloughs, with no drainage outlets, are part of a linear series lying\r\nNW. to SE. along a preglacial stream course. The beds range from a few\r\ninches to as much as 80 ft. in depth. Because of the low rainfall in\r\nrecent years many of the lakes glisten white in the sunlight.\r\n\r\nLiterally, a wild goose chase led to the discovery of these sodium\r\nsulphate deposits. A Grenora hunter waded into a shallow lake to\r\nrecover a goose which had fallen into the water, and found the lake\r\nbottom covered with a hard crystal formation resembling salt deposits\r\nhe had seen in Canada, which he knew to be commercially valuable. He\r\ndirected attention to the lake, and as a result an FERA survey was\r\nundertaken in 1934, and a large amount of the mineral was found here.\r\nFertile Valley Lake No. 2 was estimated to contain 11,000,000 tons, and\r\ntwo other lakes in the vicinity 5,000,000 and 1,750,000 tons each.\r\n\r\nSodium sulphate is also known as Glauber's salt. Commercially it\r\nhas a value of about $20 a ton, and is used medicinally, in paper\r\nmanufacture, as salt for cattle, and in manufacturing soap and\r\nmunitions. In 1937 the University of North Dakota, in cooperation with\r\nthe State Highway Department, was conducting experiments to determine\r\nthe value of sodium sulphate in highway construction. At present there\r\nis little demand for North Dakota sodium sulphate because of the\r\naccessibility of sources nearer the points of consumption.\r\n\r\nAt =21 m.= is the junction with another county dirt road; =R.= on\r\nthis road to the junction with a county highway, the Grenora-Alkabo\r\nroute, at =23 m.=; =R.= on this road; at 30 the route turns =L.=\r\nand proceeds up a hill to WRITING ROCK STATE PARK, =30.3 m.= Of gray\r\ngranite, Writing Rock stands in a slight hollow on the crest of a hill,\r\ncommanding a wide view of the surrounding country. The top and two\r\nsides of the rock are covered with hieroglyphs, consisting of lines,\r\ndots, circles containing dots, and, near the top, a flying bird. Many\r\nattempts have been made to decipher the writing, which apparently was\r\ncarved into the rock at several different periods. Whatever the meaning\r\nof the inscriptions, the rock is regarded as sacred by Indians who,\r\neven after the settlement of the State, made pilgrimages here from\r\nthe Fort Peck (Mont.) Reservation and other distant points. The site,\r\nbecause of its elevation, served advantageously for smoke signals.\r\n\r\nSeveral graves have been found in the vicinity, and excavations have\r\nrevealed hammers, hatchets, arrowheads, sea shells, elk teeth, and\r\nbeads of many shapes and colors. One grave is said to have yielded\r\nbeads that measured 52 ft. when strung.\r\n\r\nThe Indians have many legends associated with the rock. The one most\r\noften heard is that told by Joe Lagweise and Tawiyaka, two old Sioux\r\nIndians of the Qu'Appelle Agency in Saskatchewan, Canada, who as\r\nyoung men visited Writing Rock and heard the story from an old man\r\ncamped there. Many years ago a party of eight warriors stopped for\r\nthe night near this rock, and just as they were falling asleep they\r\nheard a voice calling in the distance. Fearful of an enemy attack,\r\nthey investigated but found nothing. The next morning they heard a\r\nwoman's voice calling, but still they found no one. In their search,\r\nhowever, they saw this large rock with a picture on it, showing eight\r\nIndians--themselves--with their packs lying on the ground. Unable to\r\nunderstand this mystery, the warriors went on their way. On their\r\nreturn they again passed the rock, and noticed that the inscription\r\nhad changed, and appeared to hold a picture of the future. When they\r\nreached home they told their people of the mysterious rock, and the\r\nentire village moved near it, only to find that the picture had again\r\nchanged, this time showing the village with its tipis. From that time\r\non the rock was believed to foretell the future until white men moved\r\nit; whereupon it lost its power. An old Indian chief once pointed out\r\nthat the three lines on the rock indicated three graves near the stone,\r\none of which he said was that of a white child. It has been suggested\r\nthat the inscriptions may be the work of some race which lived in this\r\nregion before the Indian known to history.\r\n\r\nWriting Rock is approximately 5 ft. high and 4 ft. thick, and weighs\r\nan estimated 10 tons. A smaller rock, weighing about a ton, which\r\nstood near a spring about a mile below Writing Rock, also contains\r\ninscriptions, and has been moved to New Merrifield Hall at the\r\nUniversity of North Dakota for study.\r\n\r\nTen acres of land surrounding Writing Rock were acquired in 1936 by the\r\nState Historical Society of North Dakota and will be developed as a\r\nState park.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIDE TOUR 4B\r\n\r\n\r\n  Junction US 85--New England--Mott--Carson--Flasher--Junction ND 6.\r\n\r\n  ND 21. Junction with US 85 to junction ND 6, 126.5 m.\r\n\r\n  N. P. Ry. branch line roughly parallels route from Mott to Flasher;\r\n  Milwaukee R. R. branch between New England and Elgin.\r\n\r\n  Graveled roadbed except for 11 m. of graded dirt.\r\n\r\n  Hotel and tourist camp facilities limited in most towns; many\r\n  natural camping places along the Cannonball River.\r\n\r\nTraversing the northern part of the Missouri Slope, this route passes\r\nthrough what was ranch land, now used for diversified farming. Most of\r\nthe land adjacent to the route is underlain with deposits of lignite,\r\nand on many farms the winter's fuel is easily obtained by a little\r\ndigging. Dominating the general rolling terrain are jagged, mesa-like\r\nhills capped with brown sandstone formations. Gentle, grass-covered\r\nslopes, whose rich spring green turns to amber in the fall, rise to\r\nsteeper hillsides, above which jumbled, broken, weathered rocks lead to\r\nthe steep cliffs crowning the flat mesas.\r\n\r\nTrees are few along this route, except for the tiny groves on\r\noccasional farms, and the woods and bushes that edge the Cannonball\r\nRiver and its tributary creeks.\r\n\r\nND 21 branches E. from US 85 (_see Tour 4_), 23.5 m. S. of Belfield\r\n(_see Tour 8_). Dominating the landscape immediately E. of the junction\r\nare the two high, flat-topped, coffin-shaped RAINY BUTTES (R). At =6\r\nm.= the highway passes 2 m. N. of West Rainy Butte, and at =8 m.=\r\npasses East Rainy Butte, which appears to be only a short distance from\r\nthe route, but actually is 6 m. S. The tops of these twin heights are\r\nsometimes clouded in a faint gray mist, and according to Indian lore\r\nthey get rain at least once a day, despite the weather. Although this\r\nis an exaggeration, it is nearly true, for at times when warm currents\r\nof air strike the cold surface of the sides of the buttes the moisture\r\nin the air is condensed, resulting in fogs or mists that usually veil\r\nthe heights. This phenomenon is also common to other buttes in this\r\narea. There are evidences of Indian burials on the Rainy Buttes.\r\n\r\nNEW ENGLAND, =14 m.= (2,593 alt., 911 pop.), its seven grain elevators\r\nstanding like sentinels overlooking its level site N. of the Cannonball\r\nRiver, was founded in 1887. It was named and first settled by the\r\nNew England Colony Association, an organization from the New England\r\nStates headed by Thomas W. Bicknell (1834-1925), who was the author\r\nof several histories dealing with Rhode Island. Streets of the new\r\ntown were laid out by plowing furrows in the prairie. Before the end\r\nof the first summer 50 families had arrived, but from 1888 to 1911,\r\nwhen the Milwaukee R. R. came in, New England was little more than a\r\ntrading post. Although originally founded by New Englanders, today it\r\nis predominantly Scandinavian.\r\n\r\nND 22 forms the main street, at the southern end of which, in St.\r\nMary's Catholic schoolyard, is a SHRINE TO THE VIRGIN MARY, made of\r\nhuge slabs of petrified woods, scoria, odd rock formations from the\r\nBadlands, and \"cannonballs\" (_see Side Tour 8C_) from the river. The\r\nshrine was built by school children. Midway between the two schools on\r\nMain St. is a modern, stuccoed MEMORIAL BUILDING, a community center\r\ncompleted under the Works Progress Administration in 1936.\r\n\r\nBetween New England and =23 m.= ND 21 unites with ND 22.\r\n\r\nAt =18 m.= is the junction with a graveled county road.\r\n\r\nLeft on this road along the north bank of the Cannonball River\r\nis HAVELOCK, =6 m.= (2,566 alt., 118 pop.), named for an English\r\nstockholder in the Milwaukee R.R. In 1915 a small group of Moravians\r\nsettled here and erected a church, but by 1924 the colony had dwindled,\r\nand the church was sold to the Congregationalists. The Moravians held\r\ntheir immersion baptismal ceremonies in the Cannonball. Right from\r\nHavelock (_inquire directions at post office_), =1 m.=, to a BURNING\r\nCOAL MINE, operated until 1934, when it was discovered to be afire. At\r\ntimes smoke, accompanied by an unpleasant odor of sulphur, is emitted\r\nfrom the mine.\r\n\r\nAt =23 m.= is the eastern junction of ND 21 and ND 22; L. here on ND\r\n21. Rising ahead (R) is a series of conical hills, the TEPEE BUTTES,\r\nresembling a giant Indian encampment. The highway parallels them their\r\nentire length between =25 m.= and =28 m.=\r\n\r\nAt =36 m.= is the junction with a graveled county road.\r\n\r\nLeft on this road is REGENT, =0.8 m.= (2,461 alt., 308 pop.), named by\r\nthe railroad company when it was believed that its situation in the\r\ncenter of the county would make it the county seat. The town is on\r\nthe south bank of the Cannonball. Richard Tooker (1902-), one of the\r\nState's successful fiction writers, attended high school in Regent,\r\nand had his first story published when only 15. He wrote more than 150\r\nstories before his first novel, _Day of the Brown Horde_, appeared.\r\n\r\nNorth of Regent at =1.3 m.= is the junction with a county road; R.\r\non this road to REGENT LAKE, =2.8 m.= (_camping_, _picnicking_,\r\n_swimming_).\r\n\r\nEast of Regent on ND 21 the route proceeds for a few miles over a level\r\nplain lying S. of the almost treeless Cannonball River valley.\r\n\r\nMOTT, =51 m.= (2,399 alt., 1,036 pop.), is in the valley of the\r\nCannonball. On an elevation to the NW. the strikingly modern HETTINGER\r\nCOUNTY COURTHOUSE overlooks the river valley. The town is the terminal\r\nof an N. P. Ry. branch, and is also on the Milwaukee. CENTRAL PARK\r\n(_tourist camp_, _tennis courts_), is between 3rd and 4th Sts. Its\r\nrecreation facilities were built as an FERA project.\r\n\r\nBURT, =58 m.= (2,358 alt., 125 pop.), originally known as Alton Post\r\nOffice, was named by the N. P. Ry. to honor A. M. Burt, superintendent\r\nof the Dakota division. More than 500 poplars and Chinese elms are\r\nplanted in the town schoolyard.\r\n\r\nAt =63 m.= the highway crosses THIRTY MILE CREEK, one of the larger\r\ntributaries of the north fork of the Cannonball.\r\n\r\nAt =68 m.= is the junction with a side road.\r\n\r\nLeft on this =0.1 m.= to a LIGNITE STRIP MINE, the largest of several\r\nin this vicinity. It produces 8,000 tons annually, and rough hummocks\r\nof earth are thrown up in the stripping process.\r\n\r\nNEW LEIPZIG, =69 m.= (2,311 alt., 433 pop.), is a Russo-German\r\ncommunity, named for Leipzig in Germany, and is on both the Milwaukee\r\nand N. P. branch lines where the two roads run parallel only 200 ft.\r\napart.\r\n\r\nSeveral years before the establishment of New Leipzig the territory\r\nto the S. was settled by a large group of Finns, of whom about a\r\ndozen families now remain. Because the settlement has dwindled in\r\nrecent years, many native customs have disappeared, although a few\r\nof the older people retain a superstitious belief in witchcraft, and\r\nthere are five or six _saunas_, or steam baths, in which water is\r\npoured on hot stones in a tightly closed shelter. At butchering time\r\neach autumn, rye and wheat flour are hulled, ground oats are mixed\r\nwith the blood of beeves, and baked in round, thin rings similar to\r\ndoughnuts. These rings are placed on long sticks, 30 or 40 at a time,\r\nthoroughly hardened near a fire, then stored in barrels, with lime as a\r\npreservative, for use throughout the winter and coming summer.\r\n\r\nELGIN, =74.5 m.= (2,330 alt., 505 pop.), with its many trees, is a\r\npleasant Russo-German town. Its first name, Shanley, was discarded when\r\nthe N. P. came through because of its similarity to Stanley. A new\r\nname was being discussed by a group waiting for a train one day when a\r\nmember of the group, having looked at his watch, suggested the trade\r\nname, Elgin, as a good town site name. His suggestion met with approval\r\nof the railroad company. /#\r\n\r\nRight from Elgin on an unimproved county road to the north fork of the\r\nCannonball River, =2 m.=, where are several suitable camping places\r\nunder the trees of the narrow river valley.\r\n\r\nThe road continues S. of the river. Sloping up from the stream,\r\nMEDICINE BUTTE (L), =3 m.=, is a high hill topped with a large, almost\r\ncubical block of sandstone used for many years as a PRAYER ROCK by\r\nIndian tribes, and carved with picture symbols of human hands, buffalo\r\nheads, bear paws, and other figures. It was the practice of the Indians\r\nto leave offerings at the rock and return the following day, when, the\r\nolder Indians still relate, the pictures on the rock would tell them\r\nwhether their prayers were to be answered. Beads, pieces of pottery,\r\nand other traces of votive offerings are still found near the stone. At\r\nthe foot of the hill to the W. is a circular area, approximately 80 yd.\r\nin diameter, where it is believed that native worshipers danced while\r\nencamped near the sacred hill. Little vegetation grows on the plot,\r\nindicating that years of dancing packed the earth firmly.\r\n\r\nAt =76.5 m.= is the junction with ND 49, a graveled highway.\r\n\r\nLeft on this highway to HEART BUTTE (L), =17 m.=, known to the Sioux\r\nas Ta canta wakpa Paha (_Heart River Butte_). From this elevation\r\nthe surrounding country is visible for 20 m. in all directions, and\r\nin early days ranchers used the hill as a lookout when searching for\r\nstrayed cattle or horses. The wooded valley of the Heart River is 4 m.\r\nto the S., although it appears much nearer. In the sandstone formation\r\natop the butte is a cave formed by wind and water erosion.\r\n\r\nEast of Elgin on ND 21 is the junction with a graveled county road,\r\n=85.5 m.=\r\n\r\nRight on this road is LEITH, =4 m.= (2,353 alt., 174 pop.), named for\r\nLeith, Scotland. It is on the Milwaukee R. R.\r\n\r\nSouth of Leith on an unimproved county road to the junction with\r\nanother dirt road, =6 m.=; R. on this road to another junction at =7\r\nm.=, where a vast deposit of small sea shells covers approximately one\r\nsquare mile to a depth of 4 ft., visible evidence that ages ago this\r\nregion was the bed of a large sea. Only a thin layer of rich black soil\r\ncovers the deposit, and in plowed fields the shells are easily seen.\r\nThe practical-minded farmers of this region have found a good use for\r\nthis gift of the prehistoric sea; they pulverize the shells and feed\r\nthem to their poultry to provide the calcium in their diet.\r\n\r\nCARSON, =90.5 m.= (2,289 alt., 356 pop.), is a compact little town on\r\nthe slope of a hill, dominated by the large, white frame courthouse at\r\nthe high end of the main street. It is named for two early settlers,\r\nFrank Carter and Simon Pederson.\r\n\r\nLeft from Carson an unimproved county road leads to the HEART RIVER,\r\n=12 m.=\r\n\r\nRight on the south bank of the stream to a good camping place, =1 m.=\r\nThe river, free from rocks at this point, is deep enough for swimming.\r\n\r\nAcross the river (L) to the G. A. Johnson home. On a slight rise in\r\nthe pasture back of the house is a row of evenly spaced piles of four\r\nor five stones, about one-fourth mile long, placed at a right angle to\r\nthe brink of the hill. This is believed to have been an Indian BUFFALO\r\nRUN, in which the Indians placed banners of red cloth or buckskin\r\nbetween the piles, then drove the hunted buffalo toward them. The\r\nanimals, frightened by the banners, would swerve toward the crest of\r\nthe hill where in their rush they would stumble down the incline and\r\nfall easy prey to the arrows and spears of the hunters.\r\n\r\nAt =103.5 m.= is the junction with ND 31, a graveled highway.\r\n\r\nRight on this highway to the DOG TOOTH BUTTES (R), =2 m.= From a\r\ndistance their outlines indicate that they are well named. These buttes\r\nwere a landmark on the Bismarck-Deadwood trail during the Black Hills\r\ngold rush from 1876 to 1884. The stagecoaches with their four-horse\r\nteams, and the lumbering ox teams pulling heavily loaded freight\r\nwagons, passed just SE. of here, leaving deep ruts which are still\r\nvisible where ND 31 crosses them immediately S. of the buttes.\r\n\r\nAt =6 m.= on ND 31 is RALEIGH (2,038 alt., 202 pop.), a German\r\ncommunity, originated as Dog Tooth Post Office on the Bismarck-Deadwood\r\ntrail. Purebred livestock is raised on many of the farms in this\r\nvicinity.\r\n\r\nLeft at =8 m.= are THREE BUTTES. From the tallest of these peaks a\r\nfar-reaching view is presented. On a clear day Mandan, 50 m. to the\r\nNE., is visible.\r\n\r\nFLASHER, =108.5 m.= (1,905 alt., 346 pop.), its residence district\r\nscattered over the south slope of a hill and its business street at the\r\nfoot, is a Russo-German community named for Mabel Flasher, niece and\r\nsecretary of William H. Brown, head of the land company that owned many\r\nof the town sites along the N. P. Ry. branch.\r\n\r\nAt =126.5 m.= is the junction with ND 6 (_see Side Tour 8C_), 26 m. S.\r\nof Mandan (_see Tour 8_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOUR 5\r\n\r\n\r\n  Junction US 81--Cavalier--Rolla--Belcourt--Dunseith--Bottineau--\r\n    Mohall--Crosby--(Scobey, Mont.). ND 5.\r\n\r\n  Junction with US 81 to Montana Line, 329 m.\r\n\r\n  Soo Ry. branch roughly parallels route from Flaxton to Montana\r\n  Line; G. N. Ry. branches touch route at intervals between junction\r\n  US 81 and Lignite, and branch parallels route between Lignite and\r\n  Crosby.\r\n\r\n  Graveled roadbed entire route.\r\n\r\n  Usual tourist accommodations in principal towns.\r\n\r\nThis route, paralleling the international boundary 10 to 15 miles to\r\nthe north, passes through some of the oldest and some of the newest\r\ntowns in the State. In the eastern section, where the country is more\r\nproductive and settlement first began, are towns established in the\r\n1870's, while in the western area, where occupation was slower, are a\r\nnumber of towns founded in the twentieth century. The route begins in\r\nthe low, level wheatlands of the Red River Valley, at one time the bed\r\nof glacial Lake Agassiz, and soon doubles its altitude by rising 800\r\nfeet upon the broad, rough, less thickly settled Drift Prairie, which\r\nstretches away approximately two-thirds of the distance across the\r\nState. This wide section, which includes the wooded Turtle Mountains\r\nand the level bottom of another glacial lake, Lake Souris, was once a\r\nhunters' paradise--a prize which involved the Chippewa Indians, who\r\nlong held it, in frequent conflict with their enemies the Sioux. With\r\nthe coming of the whites the region saw new rivals, as the XY, North\r\nWest, and Hudson's Bay Companies struggled savagely and often bloodily\r\nfor domination of the fur trade. Most of the Chippewa in the State now\r\nlive on the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation, through which the route\r\npasses.\r\n\r\nOver the bed of ancient Lake Souris, west of the hills, once roamed\r\nhordes of buffalo; later, during early white settlement, this region\r\nwas the feeding ground of great numbers of horses and cattle. After\r\ncrossing the Souris (Mouse) River twice and the long, narrow Upper Des\r\nLacs Lake, the route ascends 300 to 400 feet to cross the Missouri\r\nPlateau, an open, rugged country, marked here and there with the homes\r\nof ranchers and farmers, and pitted by the strip mines extracting the\r\nhuge lignite coal deposits that underlie the plateau.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON, =0.0 m.= (_see Tour 1_), is R. of ND 5 where it branches W.\r\nfrom US 81 (_see Tour 1_).\r\n\r\nAt =5 m.= is the junction with ND 18, a graveled highway.\r\n\r\nRight on this highway to the junction with a graveled spur, =5 m.=; R.\r\non this spur is BATHGATE, =8.5 m.= (828 alt., 292 pop.), pleasantly\r\nsituated in a bend of the TONGUE RIVER. At the southern side of town\r\non a 40-acre tract of meadow and hayland are the buildings of the\r\nSTATE SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND, established in 1908. Thirty-five to forty\r\nchildren attend each year for a nine-month period.\r\n\r\nCAVALIER, =9 m.= (894 alt., 850 pop.), Pembina County seat, was named\r\nfor Charles Cavileer, one of the first white men to make a home within\r\nthe borders of the present State. Usage has changed the spelling of the\r\nname. The town was established in 1875 by settlers who came overland\r\nfrom Missouri in a train of 10 covered wagons. The members of the train\r\nintended settling in Manitoba, Canada; but, not liking the country\r\nthere, they returned to the United States, two of the families founding\r\nthe Tongue River Settlement, which later became Cavalier. They came\r\nfrom Canada by way of Pembina over the old Fort Totten Trail, which\r\nran where Main St. now passes and was one of several trails used by\r\ntrappers, hunters, and traders as they journeyed between the hunting\r\ngrounds and the trading posts. Over these trails often moved long\r\ncaravans of creaking, fur-laden Red River oxcarts, on their long trek\r\nto St. Paul. Some trains are said to have contained as many as 1,500\r\ncarts.\r\n\r\nThe jog in Cavalier's Main St. results from the fact that the land for\r\nthe street, contributed by two men who owned adjoining farms, did not\r\nmeet exactly. This complication was not discovered until after some\r\nbuildings had been erected, but by that time it would have been too\r\ncostly to change the route.\r\n\r\nAKRA (Icelandic, _fields_), =14 m.= (980 alt., 30 pop.), is near the\r\nsouthern edge of the Pembina Mountains (_see Side Tour 5A_), whose\r\nwooded height ahead abruptly marks the western edge of the level Red\r\nRiver Valley and the eastern edge of the Drift Prairie. The town is one\r\nof a group of communities comprising what is believed to be the largest\r\nIcelandic settlement in the United States (_see below_).\r\n\r\nAt =16 m.= is CAMP COMFORT, an acre of beautifully wooded grounds\r\n(_good camping and picnicking facilities_). Camp Comfort marks the\r\npoint at which the old Hunters Trail of fur-trading days crossed the\r\nTongue River.\r\n\r\nHALLSON, =18 m.= (1,020 alt., 10 pop.), founded in 1878 and named\r\nfor Johan Hallson, the first settler, is the oldest of the Icelandic\r\nsettlements (_see below_). At Hallson is the junction with ND 32, a\r\ngraveled highway.\r\n\r\nLeft on this highway is MOUNTAIN, =5 m.= (1,030 alt., 250 pop.), so\r\nnamed because of its elevation. It is one of the larger Icelandic\r\ntowns. A log church here, built in 1886, is said to be the oldest\r\nIcelandic church on the North American continent. When the Icelanders\r\nfirst came to America in 1874, they settled at Gimli, Man., Canada.\r\nLater, possibly because the rough topography of the country reminded\r\nthem of the fjords and cliffs of their native land, they colonized\r\nhere near the headwaters of the Little Tongue River. At present their\r\nsettlement includes the towns of Hallson, Mountain, Akra, Svold,\r\nHensel, and Gardar. From the first they have engaged in diversified\r\nfarming and therefore have usually known a fair degree of prosperity.\r\nAn artistic and deeply imaginative people, perhaps due to the Celtic\r\ninfusion received when their Norwegian ancestors fled to Ireland upon\r\nthe ascendency of Harald the Fair-Haired, they still retain many of\r\ntheir old Icelandic traditions and arts, and their folklore is replete\r\nwith weird and highly colored sagas. They take great pleasure in\r\npreserving their native culture, and often present plays and pageants\r\nshowing the dress and customs of Iceland.\r\n\r\nIcelanders are particularly adept in gold and silver filigree work\r\nand in hand-carving. Almost every home has its treasures brought from\r\nfar-off Iceland--beautifully hand-carved riding whips adorned with\r\nsilver and gold ferrules, toys and spoons made from cow-horn, and bread\r\nboards carved with leaves and grapes.\r\n\r\nThe little community has produced many distinguished men, among whom\r\nare Sveinbjorn Johnson (1883-), professor at law in the University of\r\nIllinois and former State supreme court justice (1922-28); Stephen G.\r\nStephenson, poet honored by the Icelandic Government; Emil Walters\r\n(1893-), whose paintings have been shown at Eastern art centers; and\r\nVilhjalmur Stefansson (1879-), scientist and explorer.\r\n\r\nRecently large deposits of fuller's earth have been discovered near\r\nMountain. It is estimated that approximately 5,000,000 tons lie in\r\none 200-acre plot. This clay is used for reclaiming motor oil and for\r\npurifying animal and vegetable oils. The deposit in this area lies\r\nalong the valleys of streams from the Canadian boundary to about 10 m.\r\nS. of Mountain and W. for an unknown distance.\r\n\r\nAt =20 m.= is the junction (R) with ND 32 (_see Side Tour 5A_). At this\r\njunction is OAK LAWN HISTORIC SITE, a small park owned by the State\r\nhistorical society, in which is a weathered old LOG CHURCH, built in\r\n1885 and for many years a landmark in the area.\r\n\r\nAt =23 m.= is the junction with a county road.\r\n\r\nLeft on this road is CONCRETE, =1 m.= (1,100 alt., 40 pop.), named by\r\nMrs. Webster Merrifield, whose husband, for many years president of the\r\nState university at Grand Forks, was one of the owners of the cement\r\nmines once operated here near the source of the Tongue River. At the\r\nheight of production 500 bbl. were turned out per day, but operations\r\nwere discontinued when a cheaper type of cement was imported.\r\n\r\nLeft at =43 m.= is a small AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENTAL STATION, a\r\nsubstation of the State agricultural college at Fargo.\r\n\r\nLANGDON, =44 m.= (1,612 alt., 1,221 pop.), became Cavalier County\r\nseat in 1884, through the efforts, it is said, of a dozen bachelors\r\nwho, working hard and changing names and apparel often on election\r\nday, voted all the sod shacks--whose owners were either absent or not\r\ntaking time to vote--for miles around. Originally called McHugh for a\r\nprominent early settler, the town later adopted the name of Langdon in\r\nhonor of the man who made the survey for the local branch of the G. N.\r\nRy. and who presented the village with a bell for the school soon to be\r\nbuilt.\r\n\r\nAn unusual enterprise in Langdon is the Haymow Theater, a children's\r\norganization which has presented plays annually for more than a quarter\r\nof a century. Children of some of the first members of the company are\r\nnow taking part in the plays. Performances are held (_adm. 10c_) during\r\nthe summer in the loft of the R. T. BURKE BARN (_for directions inquire\r\nat post office_).\r\n\r\nCLYDE, =69 m.= (1,618 alt., 275 pop.), is named for the Clyde River in\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\nAt =86 m.= is a junction with ND 4 (_see Tour 2_), which to =92 m.=\r\nunites with ND 5.\r\n\r\nROLLA, =108.5 m.= (1,817 alt., 852 pop.), forms the eastern gateway to\r\nthe lakes and hills of the TURTLE MOUNTAINS, a rolling plateau rising\r\n300 to 400 ft. above the surrounding country. It stretches 40 m. to\r\nthe W. and about 30 m. N. and S., and is bisected by the international\r\nboundary. The mountains were named by the Indians, to whom their\r\noutline suggested the form of the sacred turtle. Rolla is the Rolette\r\nCounty seat, and its name is believed to be a contraction of the\r\ncounty name. At Rolla in 1889 was established the short-lived Rolla\r\nUniversity, which opened its doors to 45 students, and closed them when\r\nlack of funds became pressing. During 15 years of his young manhood\r\nJohn Burke (1859-1937), three times Governor of the State (1907-13),\r\nformer United States Treasurer (1913-21), and former chief justice of\r\nthe State supreme court (1935-37), lived in Rolla. Here is the office\r\nof the secretary of the International Peace Garden, Inc. (_see below_),\r\nwhere most of the business of the corporation is transacted.\r\n\r\nAt Rolla is the junction with ND 30, a graveled highway.\r\n\r\nRight on this highway is ST. JOHN, =8 m.= (1,944 alt., 372 pop.), named\r\nfor the parish in eastern Quebec from which came the Rev. John Malo,\r\nearly missionary to the Indians. The town is a port of entry from\r\nCanada and is the oldest white settlement on the eastern edge of the\r\nmountains. Because of its position near some of the most attractive\r\nlakes of the region, it has a fair tourist trade during the summer\r\nmonths. St. John's Day, honoring St. John the Baptist, patron saint of\r\nthe French Canadians who settled the region, is celebrated June 24.\r\n\r\nLeft from St. John on ND 43, a graded dirt highway, to the junction\r\nwith a county road, =9 m.=; R. here =0.5 m.= to ST. CLAUDE STATE PARK,\r\nestablished to commemorate the founding of one of the first permanent\r\nwhite settlements in the Turtle Mountains. The colony grew up about a\r\nschool and church inaugurated by Father Malo in 1882. As it developed\r\nit gradually moved S. and became the town of St. John.\r\n\r\nAt =13 m.= on ND 43 is the junction with a county road; R. here =1.8\r\nm.= to the frame buildings of a STATE GAME AND FISH RESERVE, an\r\n800-acre tract containing OAK, GRAVEL, and LONG LAKES. Five hundred\r\nacres are fenced to confine herds of elk, deer, and buffalo. Impure\r\nwater in the lakes, caused by the recession of the water level, has\r\nnecessitated the abandonment of the fish hatchery near Gravel Lake. In\r\nthe MUSEUM across the road from the hatchery is a good mounted display\r\nof the game birds, fish, and wild animals of the Turtle Mountains.\r\n\r\nOn ND 43 is LAKE UPSILON, =14.5 m.=, largest lake on the eastern side\r\nof the mountains, named for its resemblance to the Greek letter \"Y.\"\r\nIt is one of the most attractive and most popular lakes of the Turtle\r\nMountains group.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n                                        FORT ABRAHAM LINCOLN STATE PARK\r\n\r\n                                       Above: Blockhouse of Fort McKeen]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n                                      Below: Slant Indian Village Lodge\r\n\r\n  _Photos by Russell Reid_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n                                                  MARQUIS DE MORES\r\n                                                  (from an old drawing)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BADLANDS\r\n\r\n                                           _Photo by Russell Reid_]\r\n\r\nBELCOURT, =115.5 m.= (1,619 alt., 6,334 pop., including Indian\r\nreservation), agency headquarters for the Turtle Mountain Indian\r\nReservation, lies in a shallow valley on the southeastern border of\r\nthe hills. It was named for the Rev. George Antoine Belcourt, a priest\r\nprominent in the establishment of the community. The Indians, about 95\r\npercent of whom are of mixed Chippewa Indian and French blood, make\r\ntheir homes in crude cabins on small farms out in the reservation.\r\nAcademic and vocational training for the children is provided by the\r\nlarge consolidated school in Belcourt. The Chippewa are woods Indians\r\nwho when first encountered by the whites dwelt in the region of the\r\nGreat Lakes. From here they pressed W., often warring with their\r\nenemies the Sioux, until ultimately their hunting grounds included the\r\nTurtle Mountain region. With the white occupation of the West their\r\nrange in North Dakota was reduced until finally it was limited to this\r\nsmall and crowded reservation of 72 sq. m. (_See_ INDIANS AND THEIR\r\nPREDECESSORS.)\r\n\r\nEach year the Indians hold a sun dance (_June_; _approx. 5 m. NE. of\r\nBelcourt_; _no set date or place_). The ceremony lasts for several\r\ndays. At the fairgrounds in Belcourt an Indian fair is conducted\r\n(_Oct._).\r\n\r\nSince 1896 the week of St. Ann has been the occasion of a retreat at\r\nBelcourt for the people of the mountains, for whom St. Ann is the\r\npatron saint. Many of the Indians bring their tipis in which they live\r\nduring the retreat. The week is culminated with the feast of St. Ann\r\n(_July 26, if it falls on Sun. or on Sun. following that date_). On\r\nthe feast day a procession is held, with hundreds participating. Many\r\ncures--none, however, authenticated by the Roman Catholic Church--have\r\nbeen attributed to the shrine at the Belcourt church.\r\n\r\nDUNSEITH, =131 m.= (1,715 alt., 484 pop.), scattered over level land\r\nat the edge of the Turtle Mountains, is the southern entrance to these\r\nhills. Its name means _city of peace_, and was selected to honor the\r\nfirst white man in the vicinity and also the city of Dunseith in\r\nScotland. The town is the terminus of a G. N. Ry. branch from the main\r\nline at York (_see Tour 6_).\r\n\r\nThe Dunseith Gristmill was built on Willow Creek in 1887 of lumber\r\nhauled from Devils Lake by ox teams. It continued to grind for several\r\nyears after steam boilers and modern machinery had come into general\r\nuse, but in 1913 it was damaged by fire and has never been repaired.\r\n\r\nDunseith may have a buried treasure somewhere in the foothills. In 1893\r\nits Turtle Mountain Bank was robbed, and the robber had time to bury\r\nhis loot in the hills before he was shot by a posse. The stolen money\r\nwas never found, and the bank was forced to close.\r\n\r\nAt Dunseith is the junction with ND 3, a graveled highway.\r\n\r\nRight on this highway to the junction with a graveled road, =2 m.=\r\n\r\nRight on this road to SAN HAVEN, =0.5 m.=, State tuberculosis\r\nsanatorium, situated in a 2,500-acre game reserve on the southern slope\r\nof the mountains overlooking a vast expanse of prairie.\r\n\r\nNorth from the junction with the graveled road, ND 3 runs over ridges\r\nand past little lakes, into the Turtle Mountains, whose hills are the\r\nhabitat of hundreds of deer in addition to many varieties of song and\r\ngame birds.\r\n\r\nOn ND 3 is the INTERNATIONAL PEACE GARDEN, =12.5 m.=, a memorial to\r\nthe peace which has prevailed between this country and Canada for more\r\nthan 120 years. The garden lies partly in North Dakota and partly in\r\nManitoba. On the international boundary stands a stone cairn with a\r\nplaque bearing a pledge of peace:\r\n\r\n    \"To God in His Glory\r\n    We two Nations do pledge ourselves\r\n    That so long as men shall live\r\n    We will not take up arms against one another.\"\r\n\r\nA formal garden, one mile square, is planned (1938) on the\r\nInternational Line. It will center about a peace fountain around which\r\na circular garden plot will form a visible ring of friendship between\r\nthe two nations. The memorial has attracted wide attention because\r\nof its noble purpose, and several foreign countries have expressed a\r\ndesire to aid in its development. It is rededicated with appropriate\r\nceremonies each year (_1st wk. in Aug._).\r\n\r\nTo the S. and W. of the hills and also in the northeastern section of\r\nthe State a great number of the settlers were of Scottish descent,\r\nand each year in connection with the ceremonies at the Peace Garden a\r\nHighlanders' Frolic is held with old-fashioned Scotch music, dances,\r\nand games.\r\n\r\nWest of Dunseith for 50 m. the route has not a single curve or jog.\r\n\r\nAt =138 m.= is the junction with a partly improved dirt road.\r\n\r\nRight on this attractive road to BUTTE ST. PAUL PARK, =3 m.=, plainly\r\nmarked by Butte St. Paul (2,500 alt.), highest point on the southern\r\nedge of the Turtle Mountains. A steep climb up the eastern slope leads\r\nto the 15-foot stone cairn commemorating the work of the Rev. G. A.\r\nBelcourt, missionary to the Indians, who on his first visit in 1853\r\nplaced a wooden cross where the cairn now stands. From the top of the\r\nbutte a beautiful scene stretches away to the tree-covered plateau on\r\nthe N. and E. and to the prairies on the S. and W.\r\n\r\nBOTTINEAU, =148.5 m.= (1,645 alt., 1,332 pop.), was named for Pierre\r\nBottineau (c. 1812-1895), most noted of Dakota guides (_see_ HISTORY).\r\nIt lies beside tree-bordered OAK CREEK on a gently rolling plain.\r\nMost of its settlers were of Scottish descent, but the western end\r\nof the mountains was long nicknamed Little Norway, and until recent\r\nyears Norwegian was heard there more often than English. From 1883-84\r\na stagecoach line connected the town with the nearest railroad point,\r\nDevils Lake (_see Tour 6_), =120 m.= to the SE., whence settlers hauled\r\nsupplies with oxen.\r\n\r\nOriginally Bottineau was situated a mile farther N. When the G. N. Ry.\r\nsurvey was made, it became evident that the permanent site would be\r\nfarther S. Business houses were soon moved, but the Bottineau County\r\nCourthouse could not be legally moved without recourse to legislation.\r\nAccordingly, one morning the building was found reposing in the new\r\nsettlement. As no one was supposed to know how the transfer had been\r\neffected, no one could be prosecuted, and the expense of returning\r\nthe building to its former site provided a convenient and practical\r\nargument against that action.\r\n\r\nA catastrophe long remembered by the early residents of Bottineau was\r\na huge prairie fire in 1886 that swept 500 sq. m. of territory NW. of\r\ntown, destroying hay and buildings.\r\n\r\nThe Indians of the region were not hostile to the white settlers, but\r\nthere were Indian scares now and then, and the white men were inclined\r\nto be cautious. An old French settler living near Bottineau tells the\r\nstory of being lost with two companions. They asked some Indians for\r\ndirections, and were invited to a meal, which they accepted to avoid\r\ngiving offense. They were almost enjoying the meal, when an old squaw,\r\nwho had been stirring the stew which they had been eating, urged\r\nhospitably, \"Dig down deep; pup in bottom.\"\r\n\r\nThe STATE SCHOOL OF FORESTRY, in the northeastern part of Bottineau on\r\nOak Creek, offers a two-year junior college course in forestry. In the\r\nbotanical garden or arboretum are about 30 varieties of foreign trees,\r\nobtained on a reciprocal basis from other countries, to be tried out in\r\nthis climate. Plantings established under direction of the school are\r\nfound on farms in every county in the State. The annual output of the\r\nnursery at the present time (1938) is about 500,000 seedlings.\r\n\r\nAt Bottineau is the junction with a graveled highway called the Lake\r\nRoad, which leads NE. into the hills to Lake Metigoshe, one of the\r\nState's best-known summer resorts.\r\n\r\nRight on this road, at the southern approach to the bridge over Oak\r\nCreek, to the junction with a trail, =1 m.=\r\n\r\nLeft on this unusually delightful 5-mile trail, along the western\r\nbank of the creek. At about =0.5 m.= is the junction with a less\r\nwell-defined trail; L. here on the western side of the creek to a stone\r\ncairn marking the SITE OF THE FIRST WHITE MAN'S HOME IN BOTTINEAU\r\nCOUNTY and the original site of the town of Bottineau, =1 m.= Farther\r\non the country becomes hilly, and at =2.3 m.= a faint wagon trail\r\nleads R. through a wire gate down to the GORGE, a pleasant spot where\r\nthe creek flows through a heavily wooded ravine, an excellent place\r\nfor picnicking. Crossing the stream, the trail follows the eastern\r\nside of the creek back toward town. At =2.5 m.= is the STATE GAME\r\nFARM, temporarily (1938) used as the Bottineau Country Club; here is a\r\njunction with the Lake Road (L) which may be followed S.; along the\r\nside of the creek, a much more attractive route, at =4 m.= the trail\r\njoins the Lake Road following the creek to the CCC DAM, =4.3 m.=, just\r\nN. of the WILLOW VALE DAIRY FARM. Here the trail crosses to the western\r\nside of the stream and rejoins the trail on which it began.\r\n\r\nRight on the Lake Road to the 640-acre LAKE METIGOSHE STATE PARK, =14.5\r\nm.= In the park lodge is the HENRY KLEBE COLLECTION (_open_) of Turtle\r\nMountain fossils, Indian artifacts, and geologic formations.\r\n\r\nLeft on the Lake Road =15 m.= to the center of activity on LAKE\r\nMETIGOSHE, largest and scenically one of the most attractive of the\r\nTurtle Mountain lakes. It has 70 m. of shore line and extends across\r\nthe border into Canada. Its name comes from _metigoshe washegum_\r\n(Chippewa, _clear water lake surrounded by oaks_). There are six\r\nresort parks (_stores_, _hotels_, _cottages_, _bathing beaches_, _boat\r\nlandings_; _12-mile motorboat trip crosses into Canada, not permissible\r\nto land on Canadian side_). About 1 m. from shore is MASONS' ISLAND,\r\nwhere Masonic groups hold annual summer meetings. The Congregational\r\nConference of North Dakota has a summer Bible camp on the lake, and\r\nthe Great Plains Area of the Boy Scouts of America holds an annual\r\nencampment here.\r\n\r\nWest of Bottineau the route proceeds over the extraordinarily level\r\ncountry formed by the bed of glacial Lake Souris. At =156.5 m.= is the\r\njunction with ND 14, a graveled highway.\r\n\r\nLeft on this highway is KRAMER, =9 m.= (1,460 alt., 190 pop.), believed\r\nto have been named for one of the surveyors of the Soo Ry., which\r\npasses through the town. The Kramer Equity Cooperative Elevator, with\r\na capacity of 110,000 bu., all under one roof, is one of the largest\r\ncooperative elevators in the State.\r\n\r\nRight from Kramer =2 m.= on an improved county highway to a junction\r\nwith a road; L. on this road to the junction with another road, =3\r\nm.=; R. here to a permanent CCC CAMP, =4 m.=, whose workers construct\r\ndams on the Souris River and work on the LOWER SOURIS MIGRATORY\r\nWATERFOWL REFUGE, an area of 48,000 acres, largest project of the U. S.\r\nBiological Survey in North Dakota (1938).\r\n\r\nAt =13 m.= on ND 14 the route crosses the Mouse or Souris River,\r\nremnant of Lake Souris. At =14.5 m.= are the headquarters of the\r\nrefuge, where the ADMINISTRATION BUILDINGS are. The 100-foot\r\nobservation tower is used in studying bird life (_open, children must\r\nbe accompanied by adults_).\r\n\r\nUPHAM, =18 m.= (1,461 alt., 257 pop.), is believed to have been named\r\nby the G. N. Ry. town site company. Left from Upham at =22 m.= on an\r\nimproved county road to the largest dam being constructed on the lower\r\nSouris Refuge, a retaining dike approximately 3 m. long.\r\n\r\nAt =165.5 m.= the highway dips slightly and crosses the Souris River,\r\nhere resembling a canal, and running almost bank full. At =175 m.= is\r\na junction with US 83; between this point and =192 m.= the two roads\r\ncoincide (_see Tour 3_).\r\n\r\nMOHALL, =202 m.= (1,646 alt., 676 pop.), seat of Renville County, was\r\nnamed for M. O. Hall, publisher of the first newspaper. Platted in\r\n1903 as the terminus of the railroad, its growth for the first few\r\nmonths was rapid. The Renville County _Tribune_ of December 3 of that\r\nyear said that the G. N. Ry. agent estimated that during the preceding\r\nweek 125 carloads of material had been shipped into the new town, in\r\naddition to 175 cars lying on sidetracks along the line and billed for\r\nMohall. Four tracks were crowded with cars and eight dray lines were\r\nkept busy transferring the material to the lumberyards and points of\r\nconstruction. One hundred and seventy-five carpenters were employed,\r\nand then the demand was only half met. At that time the place had nine\r\ngrain buyers.\r\n\r\nDick Grace, motion picture stunt flier, lived here for a time.\r\n\r\nA CCC CAMP with an enrollment of about 200 adjoins the town. At present\r\n(1938) its members are assigned to work on the Upper Souris Migratory\r\nWaterfowl Refuge (_see Tour 7_).\r\n\r\nAt =205 m.= the route passes between two farms lighted by natural gas\r\nfrom wells drilled on the premises. Although natural gas in large\r\nquantities has been found in Montana, and a number of small wells have\r\nbeen opened in North Dakota, there has never been a sufficient amount\r\nin this State to form the basis for a permanent commercial enterprise.\r\n\r\nAt =214 m.= the route leads down into the mile-wide Souris valley. The\r\nstream here is lined with box elder, elm, and small fruit trees.\r\n\r\nAt =215 m.= is the junction with a graveled county road.\r\n\r\nRight on this road to the 480-acre MOUSE RIVER PARK (_boating_,\r\n_swimming_, _roller skating_, _golf_; _store_, _dining hall_,\r\n_auditorium_, cottages), =2 m.=\r\n\r\nAt =229.5 m.= is a junction with US 52, a graveled highway, which\r\nunites with ND 5 between this point and =257 m.= (_see Tour 7_).\r\n\r\nAt =258 m.= is the junction with a graveled county highway.\r\n\r\nLeft on this road is LIGNITE, =1 m.= (1,979 alt., 217 pop.), which was\r\nto have been named Kincaid, for an agent of the G. N. Ry., but through\r\nan error of the town site company was given the name intended for the\r\nneighboring town, a lignite mining center, which was consequently named\r\nKincaid.\r\n\r\nAt =8 m.= BIG BUTTE (2,200 alt.), a large grassy hill, covers about\r\ntwo sections of land, rising more than 200 ft. above the surrounding\r\nprairie. At the foot of the butte was once a spring of excellent water,\r\nfrequented by Indians passing along the old White Earth Trail from the\r\nTurtle Mountains to the Missouri River. Circles of stone and Indian\r\nmounds are found on the northern side of the butte. In early days there\r\nwas a ranch with 300 head of horses near the spring, but the owner lost\r\nall his stock to smugglers. Somewhere in the vicinity of Big Butte\r\nmay be the hiding place of $40,000. A story, not generally credited,\r\nrelates that in the late 1870's a Hudson's Bay Co. paymaster, on his\r\nway to pay employees of the company at the several trading posts in the\r\nterritory, was robbed of this amount near Estevan, Canada. The robber\r\nwas apprehended in the neighborhood of Big Butte, but not before he\r\nhad found a place to cache his loot. Taken to Portal, he died under\r\ntorture while an attempt was being made to force his secret from him.\r\nOn the tanned side of his fur coat was found a diagram believed to\r\nshow the hiding place of the treasure, which has since been the object\r\nof many searches. The accidental unearthing of a stone bearing the\r\ninscription \"1877\" inspired fresh digging. At another time the Royal\r\nMounted Police of Calgary are said to have sent men to the locality\r\nin an attempt to recover the money. So far, however, all efforts have\r\nproved unsuccessful. Some believe the treasure was found and taken\r\naway; others think it is still in the vicinity of Big Butte; and a few\r\nskeptics disdain the idea that it was ever buried here at all.\r\n\r\nAt =268.5 m.= is the junction with a graveled road.\r\n\r\nRight on this road is COLUMBUS, =0.5 m.= (1,930 alt., 516 pop.),\r\nclumped together on the flat prairie. First settled in 1902, it was\r\nmoved to the railroad in 1906 when the Soo Ry. was extended through\r\nthis part of the State. The first postmaster, Columbus Larson, gave his\r\nChristian name to this town, and his surname to the next town W.\r\n\r\nAt =269.5 m.= is a junction with ND 40, a graveled highway.\r\n\r\nLeft on this highway =3 m.= to a junction with an improved road; R.\r\nhere to the MONTANA-DAKOTA POWER PLANT, =2 m.=, in the heart of the\r\nlignite coal field. The plant was opened 1928, and today is a $300,000\r\nenterprise, supplying electrical energy to the towns of northeastern\r\nMontana and northwestern North Dakota.\r\n\r\nAt =4 m.= on ND 40 is a junction with a second improved road; L. here\r\nto the TRUAX-TRAER LIGNITE STRIP MINE, =4.5 m.=, the oldest strip mine\r\nin North Dakota. The big shovels which have been stripping the earth\r\noverburden since 1919 have piled ridges of earth so vast that they\r\nresemble miniature mountains. The eight-cubic-yard shovel saw service\r\nin the construction of the Panama Canal. It is supplemented by another\r\nof four-cubic-yard capacity. About 150,000 tons of coal are taken out\r\nannually. Huddled on a small piece of unbroken ground between the\r\nartificial buttes are the frame homes and store buildings of the little\r\ncommunity of miners.\r\n\r\nAt =273 m.= is the junction with a graveled spur.\r\n\r\nLeft on this road is LARSON, =0.5 m.= (1,931 alt., 89 pop.), a small\r\nScandinavian town, named for the first postmaster of Columbus.\r\n\r\nWest of Larson the route ascends the hills of the Missouri Plateau. At\r\n=278 m.= is the junction with a graveled road.\r\n\r\nLeft on this road to the BAUKOL-NOONAN COAL MINE, =1 m.=, third largest\r\nlignite strip mine in the State. The mining operations cover an area of\r\n1,040 acres adjacent to the town of Noonan, and the lignite vein, which\r\nlies beneath a 30-foot overburden, averages 7 to 9 ft. in thickness.\r\nThe huge, molehill-like hummocks of earth tossed up by the giant steam\r\nshovels spread fanwise from a central, electrically operated tipple.\r\nLoading and screening facilities at the tipple permit the filling of\r\nfour cars at the same time, each with a different grade of coal. The\r\ndaily output of the mine, which runs full time during the fall and\r\nwinter months, is approximately 100 cars. During the 1935-36 season\r\nmore than 170,000 tons of coal were taken out.\r\n\r\nNOONAN, =279 m.= (1,959 alt., 423 pop.), named for an early settler,\r\nhas its white buildings scattered over the northern slope of a small\r\nhill. When the town was platted in 1906, contracts stipulated that\r\nbuildings should be painted white in order that the community might\r\nlive up to its advertised name of the _White City_.\r\n\r\nCROSBY, =292.5 m.= (1,962 alt., 1,271 pop.), dominated by the dome\r\nof the Divide County Courthouse at the northern end of Main St., was\r\nnamed for a member of the town site company of Portal (_see Tour 7_).\r\nIt sprang up at the junction of the Soo and G. N. branch lines, a\r\nstrategic rail position that soon established it as a focal point for\r\ntrade in the northwestern corner of the State.\r\n\r\nStraight ahead (N) from the fairgrounds on a graveled road to the\r\nCROSBY CITY RECREATION PARK (_swimming pool_, _golf course_, _tennis\r\nand horseshoe courts_, _ski jump_, _camping ground_), =5 m.=, developed\r\nalong the Canadian border.\r\n\r\nAt =301.5 m.= is a junction with US 85 (_see Tour 4_), which unites\r\nwith ND 5 to =311 m.=\r\n\r\nFORTUNA, =315 m.= (2,190 alt., 196 pop.), a Scandinavian community,\r\nnamed for the Roman goddess of fortune, was established in the summer\r\nof 1913 when the branch line of the Soo Ry. was extended from Ambrose,\r\nN. Dak., to Whitetail, Mont. The day lots were sold, temporary business\r\nhouses, which had been squatting a mile from the present site at a post\r\noffice called Norge, were put on wheels and rolled away to the new town\r\nby night.\r\n\r\nRight from Fortuna on a county road to the DEWITT SPRING, =1 m.=, whose\r\nflow fills a two-inch pipe of water the year around. It has furnished\r\nwater for Fortuna since the founding of the village.\r\n\r\nAt =329 m.= the route crosses the Montana Line, 66 m. E. of Scobey,\r\nMont.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIDE TOUR 5A\r\n\r\n\r\n  Junction ND 5--Walhalla--Leroy. ND 32, ND 55, and an unimproved\r\n  road.\r\n\r\n  Junction ND 5 to Leroy, 25 m.\r\n\r\n  Branch of G. N. Ry. touches at Walhalla.\r\n\r\n  Graveled roadbed except for 0.5 m. outside Leroy.\r\n\r\n  Accommodations in Walhalla.\r\n\r\nThis route runs through the Pembina Mountains, a scenic region rich in\r\nhistorical associations. From Walhalla, one of the oldest towns in the\r\nState, the route turns east to the settlement of the metis, descendants\r\nof those French-Chippewa who conducted the famous Pembina hunts of the\r\nmiddle nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nND 32 branches N. from ND 5 at Oak Lawn Historic Site (_see Tour 5_),\r\n=0.0 m.=\r\n\r\nAt =8 m.= the graceful wooded PEMBINA MOUNTAINS are visible on the\r\nhorizon. The nearest elevation, 250 or 350 ft. higher than the country\r\nto the E., is known as Second Pembina Mountain, and is a portion of the\r\nPembina Escarpment, a high ridge extending from Canada through North\r\nDakota into South Dakota and southwestern Minnesota. In the southern\r\npart of North Dakota it is known as the Coteau des Prairies. First\r\nPembina Mountain, lying SE. of Second Mountain, is the prehistoric\r\ndelta of the Pembina River, formed when that stream drained the melting\r\nice sheet into Lake Agassiz (_see_ NATURAL SETTING _and Tour 1_). First\r\nPembina Mountain has an average height of 150 ft., and its eastern\r\nedge shows the various shore lines of Lake Agassiz as it receded in\r\npost-glacial times.\r\n\r\nTo the first white explorers and trappers the Pembina Mountains were\r\nknown as the Hair Hills, coveted hunting ground held by the Chippewa,\r\nwhose ownership was often hotly contested by the Sioux. During the\r\nearly nineteenth century white and half-breed hunters roamed the hills,\r\ngathering furs to be loaded on lumbering, squeaking oxcarts and sent to\r\neastern trading posts.\r\n\r\nIt was in this vicinity that Charles Cavileer (_see Tour 5_), one of\r\nthe most prominent settlers of the State, in the 1860's while making a\r\ntrip with a party from Pembina to Devils Lake, saw a herd of buffalo\r\nlike a black cloud on the horizon. The party immediately arranged their\r\ncarts in a semicircle and prepared for an onslaught. The bison came on\r\nwith a rumble like thunder, the rumble became a roar, and the earth\r\ntrembled; but when they reached the carts the herd parted and swerved\r\non either side, upsetting only the outside row of the improvised\r\nstockade. Not until the second day could the journey be resumed, and\r\neven then there were buffalo in sight for another day. The herd was\r\nbelieved to number two or three million, and in its wake was an area,\r\nseveral miles in width, entirely devoid of vegetation.\r\n\r\nAt =9 m.= (L) are the SAND SLIDES, where steep sand and gravel slopes\r\nform a precipitous funnel-shaped valley down to the PEMBINA RIVER. This\r\nstream once drained prehistoric Lake Souris into Lake Agassiz, and its\r\nrushing waters cut into the Pembina Mountains, creating the present\r\ncanyon 350 to 450 ft. deep.\r\n\r\nAt =12 m.= (R) is WALHALLA (966 alt., 700 pop.), attractively situated\r\nin the wooded river valley on the slope of Second Pembina Mountain. In\r\n1848 Father G. A. Belcourt established St. Joseph's Mission here for\r\nthe Chippewa Indians. By 1860 the settlement had become an important\r\nfur trading post, with a population of 1,800; but good furs became\r\nscarce, the bison virtually disappeared, and by 1871 \"St. Joe\" was\r\ninhabited only by a priest, the U. S. customs inspector, and some 50\r\nmetis or half-breeds, who remained only as long as the hunting was\r\ngood. The town revived, and was platted in 1877 and renamed Walhalla,\r\nfor the palace of immortality in Norse mythology.\r\n\r\nThe old bell in the Catholic church belfry, known as the ANGELUS BELL,\r\nwas brought to Father Belcourt's mission when it was opened, and was\r\nthe first church bell erected on the plains of North Dakota. It was\r\ncast in 1845, and a wreath of raised figures around the top represents\r\nscience, art, music, mechanics, and astronomy. The bell is believed\r\nto have been brought down the Red River by boat, thence to St. Joseph\r\nby oxcart. Its tone is similar to that of the old mission bells of\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nRight from Walhalla crossing the railroad tracks on a graveled road;\r\nL. on a graveled road to a METIS SETTLEMENT, =4 m.= Here, in the\r\nfoothills of the Pembina Mountains, live descendants of half-breed\r\nFrench Canadians and Indians of earlier days. The metis are found\r\nthroughout the northeastern corner of North Dakota (_see below_). In\r\nthis particular settlement they operate small farms, gaining their\r\nlivelihood by selling garden produce, berries, and cordwood. The\r\ngraveled road turns L. at =5 m.=, to Leroy (_see below_), =7 m.=\r\n\r\nAlso at =12 m.= is WALHALLA STATE PARK (L), on the eastern slope of\r\nthe Pembina Mountains. The wooded 5-acre tract contains the SITE OF\r\nALEXANDER HENRY, JR.'S TRADING POST, a temporary depot established in\r\n1801, one of the first posts in present North Dakota; also the KITTSON\r\nHOUSE, erected in 1851-52 as a trading post and warehouse under the\r\nsupervision of Norman Kittson, who became the first postmaster in North\r\nDakota. This building was originally built nearby and was moved to the\r\npark in 1915. Often locally designated as Old Settlers' Park, the area\r\nis the scene of the annual meeting and picnic of the Pembina County Old\r\nSettlers' Association (_July_).\r\n\r\nLeft from the park on a winding graveled road to the PROTESTANT\r\nCEMETERY, =0.4 m.=, where are buried two missionaries killed by Indians\r\nin the early 1850's and hence known as the Martyrs of St. Joe. At =1.4\r\nm.=, at the summit of the mountain, LOOKOUT POINT affords a fine view\r\nof the deep Pembina River valley below and the Red River Valley farming\r\narea, dotted with villages and farmhouses, which stretches away in the\r\ndistance. The point is the property of several Masonic lodges in this\r\narea, and they hold an annual picnic here.\r\n\r\nAt =15 m.= on ND 32 is the junction with ND 55, on which the route\r\ncontinues. At =22 m.= is the junction with a graveled road. After\r\ncrossing the Pembina River, the highway at =25 m.= enters LEROY (890\r\nalt., 100 pop.). The inhabitants of the town are chiefly metis and\r\ntheir log cabins are scattered in the timber along the river. From the\r\ntime the Hudson's Bay Co. began operations in 1670, French Canadians\r\nmigrated westward, intermarrying with Chippewa women. Their children\r\nwere known as metis or mixed-bloods. Inheriting the characteristics\r\nof both the Indian and the French-Canadian woodsman, the metis\r\nbecame adept voyageurs, and their part in the early fur trade of the\r\nMiddlewest was very important. They were excellent hunters, trappers,\r\nand couriers, and it is said they loved the \"musical\" sound of the Red\r\nRiver oxcarts which, with their unlubricated wooden axles and hubs\r\nscreeching across the plains, brought furs E. from the trading posts.\r\n\r\nWhen this region began to be settled the metis were the first mail\r\ncarriers, since their stamina and knowledge of the frontier made them\r\n\"brave and bold, and the most reliable men to be had.\"\r\n\r\nThe early metis of North Dakota, ancestors of the present metis,\r\nenjoyed life with true appreciation. They were fond of good dress, and\r\ntheir clothes were made of the finest imported merinos, cashmeres, and\r\nbroadcloths, bought at the trading posts. The men wore black broadcloth\r\nredingotes, long and double-breasted and trimmed with large brass\r\nbuttons. At the collar was a _capuchon_ or hood, which was never worn\r\nbut served merely as an adornment. A bright sash about the waist,\r\nbeaded moccasins, and a beaded tobacco pouch, used much as a French\r\ncourtier used his snuff box, completed the costume. The women wore the\r\ntight basque and flowing skirt, and, in summer as well as winter, a\r\nhalf dozen gaily colored petticoats, which created quite a dazzling\r\narray when the wearer stooped to tie the lace of a beaded moccasin. A\r\nblack silk kerchief was tied about the head, and over this went a large\r\nsquare of black broadcloth which wrapped about the entire body and\r\nserved as a cloak.\r\n\r\nThe metis were, and still are, fond of music and dancing. Their songs\r\ncame down from their French ancestors or were learned from the mission\r\npriests. One favorite was _Au clair de la lune_ (_By Moonlight_) and\r\nanother was _Marlbrouck s'en va-t-en guerre_ (_Marlborough Goes to\r\nWar_). Square dances, the Red River Jig, Pair O' Fours, and Reel O'\r\nCats were favorite dances, and some of them are still performed.\r\n\r\nThe most important event in the year for the metis, in the first half\r\nof the last century, was the Pembina buffalo hunt. For this, white and\r\nmetis hunters would meet at Pembina on an expedition which sometimes\r\ntook them as far as Fort Union on the Missouri (_see Side Tour 6B_).\r\nNot only men, but also women and children, went on the hunt, and even\r\nthe priest went along to counsel and advise. Equipment was carried in\r\nstridently creaking oxcarts. It was like a good-sized town on a tour.\r\nOn the hunt of 1840, probably the largest ever held, there were 1,630\r\npeople and 1,210 oxcarts, and the cost of the expedition has been\r\nestimated at $120,000. The camp was organized under a chief, with 10\r\ncaptains under him, and 10 soldiers under each captain to enforce the\r\ncamp regulations. For a first violation the saddle and bridle of the\r\noffender were cut up; for a second, his coat was destroyed; and for\r\na third, he was flogged. A thief, even if he stole something of no\r\ngreater value than a buffalo sinew--a common article of barter in the\r\nRed River country--was publicly cried \"thief.\" Hunting was not always\r\ngood; hot weather or storms delayed parties, and sometimes prairie\r\nfires were encountered. Eventually encroaching civilization put an end\r\nto the buffalo hunts, but while they were held, and when they were\r\nsuccessful, the hunters lived in plenty. The 1840 expedition took home\r\nmore than a million pounds of meat in their oxcarts.\r\n\r\nThe main food of the early metis was pemmican, or dried buffalo meat,\r\nbut wild game was also plentiful. _Galette_, an unleavened bread made\r\nby mixing flour with water, salt, and shortening, was preferred to\r\nwhite man's bread.\r\n\r\nGreat respect for old age, and deep affection for relatives\r\ncharacterize metis family relationships. Concerning birds and animals,\r\nthey have many unusual beliefs: a hungry beast coming to the door is\r\nregarded as a sign of poverty, a woodpecker pecking at a window is said\r\nto be a sign of death in the family, and snakes are believed to be\r\nsymbols of quarrels and enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOUR 6\r\n\r\n\r\n  (Duluth, Minn.)--Grand Forks--Devils\r\n  Lake--Minot--Williston--(Glasgow, Mont.). US 2.\r\n\r\n  Minnesota Line to Montana Line, 390.5 m.\r\n\r\n  G. N. Ry. roughly parallels entire route, Farmers' Line between\r\n  Devils Lake and Webster.\r\n\r\n  Graveled roadbed except for about 110 m. of short stretches\r\n  hard-surfaced.\r\n\r\n  Accommodations in principal towns.\r\n\r\nThis route reveals a cross section of the agricultural life of the\r\nState. In the east the flat, fertile lands of the narrow Red River\r\nValley, which formed the bottom of glacial Lake Agassiz, blend into\r\nthe uneven, farm-dotted surface of the broad Drift Prairie, bordered\r\non the west by the rougher, more sparsely settled grazing areas of the\r\nMissouri Plateau. The route touches on Devils Lake and crosses the\r\nlevel loop of the wooded Mouse River, a region at one time covered by\r\nLake Souris, another extinct creation of the glacial epoch. Midway\r\nacross the State is the geographic center of North America. The western\r\nhalf of the route is through a rich, though largely undeveloped,\r\nlignite coal area, formed ages ago by the inundation of prehistoric\r\nforests.\r\n\r\nGRAND FORKS, =0.0 m.= (834 alt., 17,112 pop.) (_see_ GRAND FORKS).\r\n\r\n  _Points of Interest:_ University of North Dakota, Wesley College.\r\n\r\nAt Demers Ave. and 5th St. is a junction with US 81 (_see Tour 1_),\r\nwhich unites with US 2 to the intersection of Skidmore Ave. N. and N.\r\n16th St.\r\n\r\nWest of Grand Forks US 2 passes through the western half of the Red\r\nRiver Valley, part of the bed of ancient Lake Agassiz.\r\n\r\nAt =9 m.= is the junction with a county dirt road.\r\n\r\nLeft on this road to tiny OJATA, =1 m.=, the remains of a once\r\nthriving boom town known as Stickney. In its heyday it was a railroad\r\nterminus, and for a time rivaled Grand Forks in trade. Since the site\r\nis swampland, each heavy rain makes it a quagmire, and residents,\r\nconsidering the first name too literal, soon changed it to Ojata. The\r\nplace declined when the railroad was extended W. At one time a farmer\r\nacquired the entire village in exchange for a stallion.\r\n\r\nAt =20 m.= is the junction with a county graveled road.\r\n\r\nRight on this road to TURTLE RIVER STATE PARK (_swimming_,\r\n_picnicking_, _camping_), =3 m.=, where a picturesque ravine, cut by\r\nthe once swift-flowing waters of the TURTLE RIVER, offers a pleasing\r\nvariation to the level surrounding country. The river is named for the\r\nmany small terrapin found on its banks. Just W. of the entrance are 15\r\ntumuli (mounds) built by prehistoric Indians. Excavations by Dr. A. E.\r\nJenks of the University of Minnesota have yielded copper instruments,\r\nan ivory pipe, and other artifacts. Unlike the mounds in other parts\r\nof the State (_see Side Tours 8A and 8B_), these have been plowed over\r\nand cultivated until they are only small humps on the prairie. The few\r\ntumuli opened have been easily excavated because they lie in a gravel\r\ndeposit.\r\n\r\nARVILLA, =21.5 m.= (1,019 alt., 150 pop.), was named for the wife of a\r\nbonanza farmer. The GRAND FORKS COUNTY FARM AND HOSPITAL, a large brick\r\nstructure, is situated just across the railroad track on a 136-acre\r\ntract adjoining the town on the S. The Arvilla Academy and North Dakota\r\nConservatory of Music, the first private college in the State to\r\nmaintain a music department, was founded in 1886 by Rev. John Allen\r\nBrown, Presbyterian pastor at Arvilla. Miss Sadie P. Brown, daughter of\r\nthe founder, and a graduate of the Boston Conservatory of Music, headed\r\nthe music department. The existence of the academy was brief, for the\r\nbuilding was destroyed by fire in 1893 and was never rebuilt.\r\n\r\nThe CRYSTAL SPRINGS STOCK FARM, =23.5 m.=, consisting of 2,480 acres\r\nalong the Turtle River, was a bonanza farm and then a stock farm,\r\nbut now is known for the spring water bottled here for commercial\r\npurposes. In its early days the 20-room house, now standing empty with\r\nits venetian shutters flapping in the wind, was the scene of a social\r\nlife that rivaled the surrounding bonanza acres in expansiveness and\r\namplitude. H. T. Hersey, a Minnesota millionaire, became interested in\r\nwheat farming and built the house. His wife installed a full staff of\r\nservants, and many parties were held for eastern friends. On several\r\noccasions James J. Hill stopped his special train here to visit the\r\nHerseys, and once a special train carrying members of the State\r\nlegislature stopped while its passengers were entertained at this\r\nprairie palace. Eventually Hersey tired of his role of gentleman farmer\r\nand sold his farm to James Streeter, prominent Larimore real estate\r\ndealer and farmer.\r\n\r\nLARIMORE, =28 m.= (1,135 alt., 979 pop.), was named for N. D. Larimore,\r\nstockholder and business head of the Elk River Valley Farm, which\r\nwas once the world's largest farm under single management. Most of\r\nthe bonanza farms were divided into a number of tracts, each under a\r\nforeman, but the Elk River Valley Farm had all operations centralized.\r\nIts huge proportions attracted the St. Louis World's Fair Foreign\r\nCommission, which visited the farm in 1904, at which time there were\r\n11,000 acres under cultivation. From this visit a great influx of\r\nnorthern Europeans resulted, leading to the breaking up of the bonanza\r\nfarms and the sale of small farms to the new settlers.\r\n\r\nThe CITY PARK (_wading pool_, _tennis courts_, _tourist camp_) is in\r\nthe same block as the city hall.\r\n\r\nAt =32.5 m.= the highway crosses the Turtle River, near a dam built by\r\nthe Civilian Conservation Corps (_swimming_, _picnic grounds_).\r\n\r\nMcCANNA, =38 m.= (1,142 alt., 100 pop.), was named for S. A. McCanna,\r\nowner of the MCCANNA FARM (R), now the largest in the western part of\r\nGrand Forks County. Large modern buildings adjacent to the town on the\r\nNW., and the use of modern farm methods make it one of the show places\r\nin the area.\r\n\r\nNIAGARA, =44.5 m.= (1,443 alt., 207 pop.), was named for Niagara\r\nCounty, N. Y. Because of uncertainty as to where the railroad would\r\npass, the town was first built on skids 1 m. E. of the present site,\r\nand was moved when the railroad came in 1882.\r\n\r\nPETERSBURG, =51.5 m.= (1,524 alt., 310 pop.), named for a pioneer\r\nclergyman in the community, has a population predominantly Norwegian,\r\nas has MICHIGAN CITY, =57.5 m.= (1,520 alt., 433 pop.), platted on land\r\nof the James Lamb family, who were among early arrivals in the vicinity\r\nand have continued to be prominent in local affairs. The town was named\r\nin honor of the native State of many of its first settlers. In the\r\nearly 1880's an error in billing sent here an entire trainload of iron\r\nore intended for Michigan City, Ind. The village officially retains its\r\noriginal name, but local usage has abridged this to \"Michigan.\"\r\n\r\nMAPES, =62.5 m.= (1,530 alt., 56 pop.), once a prosperous grain\r\nshipping center, was named for Emery Mapes, one of the men who worked\r\nout the formula for the nationally known Cream of Wheat.\r\n\r\nAt =67.5 m.= is the junction with ND 1, a graveled highway (_see Side\r\nTour 8B_).\r\n\r\nLAKOTA, =68.5 m.= (1,518 alt., 860 pop.), is the seat of Nelson County.\r\nIts name is derived from the Teton Sioux word meaning _allies_, which\r\nis the same as the Santee Sioux _dakota_. The many trees lining\r\nLakota's streets are the result of experiments by a pioneer who\r\nbelieved trees could be grown on the barren prairies. The TOFTHAGEN\r\nLIBRARY AND MUSEUM (_open_), built in 1927, was a gift to the city from\r\nA. M. Tofthagen, Nelson County pioneer. It contains 5,000 volumes, and\r\ncurios gathered by the donor in his travels.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT, =72.5 m.= (1,534 alt., 67 pop.), was named for Frank Bartlett\r\nof Larimore, who owned the town site. For a time Bartlett was the end\r\nof the rail line, a typical boom town, and had 21 saloons; one, the\r\nDiamond, employed a Negro piano player and singer who usually ended his\r\nperformance in a burst of \"Bartlett, dear Bartlett, will be a dandy of\r\nDakota yet.\"\r\n\r\nDOYON, =78.5 m.= (1,512 alt., 204 pop.), was named for Charles H.\r\nDoyon, a bonanza farmer.\r\n\r\nDEVILS LAKE, =96 m.= (1,466 alt., 5,451 pop.), seat of Ramsey County,\r\nwas at one time head of steamboat navigation on the then important\r\ninland sea of Devils Lake (_see Side Tour 6A_). The lake has receded 5\r\nm. in the half century since the vicinity was settled, and the town now\r\noverlooks a dry bed and shrunken shore line. Fort Totten, which later\r\nbecame Fort Totten Indian Agency (_see Side Tour 6A_), was established\r\non the southern shore of the lake in 1867 to place the Indians of the\r\nregion on a permanent reservation. In 1882 the Government held that the\r\nChippewa Indians had no claim to the lands N. of the lake, settlers\r\nbegan to come in, and Creelsburgh, or Creel City, 4 m. NW. of the\r\npresent site of Devils Lake, became the first white community in the\r\narea. The town of Devils Lake was founded the following year and many\r\nCreel City citizens moved to the new town site.\r\n\r\nOne of the first settlers in Creel City was Capt. Edward Heerman, who\r\ninaugurated steamboat navigation on Devils Lake. On July 4, 1883, the\r\nfirst train on regular schedule arrived in Devils Lake, and was met by\r\nHeerman's steamboat, the _Minnie H._ The service was later augmented\r\nby two smaller steamers. Rails were laid on the wharf at Devils Lake\r\nso that all freight and passengers for Fort Totten, Minnewaukan, and\r\nother points across the lake were transferred directly from car to\r\nsteamer. By 1909, however, the water of the lake had receded 4 m. from\r\nthe city, 6 m. from Minnewaukan, and nearly 2.5 m. from the fort, so\r\nnavigation came to an end. The shrinking of Devils Lake has been one of\r\nthe arguments for the Missouri River Diversion project, which, it has\r\nbeen asserted, would raise the water level of the lake.\r\n\r\nThe STATE SCHOOL FOR DEAF is at 14th St. and 1st Ave., situated in\r\nexpertly landscaped grounds. Established in 1890, the school has\r\ngained international recognition for its work in physical education\r\nfor the deaf. An elaborate revue, known as a Rhythm Pageant (_public_,\r\n_June_), is presented annually at the school's graduation exercises,\r\nand motion pictures of this pageant have been made for study in similar\r\ninstitutions elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAt the eastern end of 2nd St. is the I. O. O. F. HOME, maintained by\r\nthe North Dakota Grand Lodge of the Odd Fellows for its aged members\r\nand orphans of former members. It is a three-story brick building\r\nsurrounded by landscaped yard and gardens.\r\n\r\nThe WORLD WAR MEMORIAL BUILDING, 504 4th St., is a community recreation\r\ncenter. Studios and transmitter of KDLR are in the Grayson Hotel\r\nbuilding at the cor. 5th Ave. and 7th St.\r\n\r\nAt the W. end of 5th St. is the junction of ND 20, a graveled highway\r\n(_see Side Tour 6A_) and ND 19. Right at this junction is ROOSEVELT\r\nPARK (_swimming pool_, _picnicking_, _camping_), built as a WPA project.\r\n\r\nNorth of Devils Lake US 2 passes SWEETWATER LAKE, =105 m.=, once a\r\nlarge body of fresh water that attracted pioneers. Today, like that of\r\nDevils Lake, its shore line has greatly receded.\r\n\r\nCHURCHS FERRY, =123 m.= (1,460 alt., 295 pop.), developed from a\r\nferry established by Irvine Church across Mauvaise Coulee (Fr., _bad\r\nstreambed_) in 1886, so named by French explorers because it was\r\ndifficult to cross, the channel once drained a large territory into\r\nDevils Lake to the S. Although it has been dry for several years, in\r\nthe 1870's and 1880's, until Church began his ferry, all goods for the\r\narea NW. and W. of Devils Lake had to be boated across or hauled around\r\nthe southern shore of the lake.\r\n\r\nAt =124 m.= is the junction with US 281, a graveled highway (_see Tour\r\n2_), which unites with US 2 from this point to =131 m.=\r\n\r\nLEEDS, =135 m.= (1,514 alt., 725 pop.), with a predominantly\r\nScandinavian population, was established in 1884. It has paved streets\r\nand a park (_swimming pool_). Because many stockholders in the G. N.\r\nRy. were Englishmen, several of the towns along the railroad, including\r\nLeeds, were given names of English towns. One of the first newspapers\r\nin this region, the Leeds _News_, founded in 1903, boosting the new\r\ncommunity in the customary manner, lauded it with this characteristic\r\nhumor: \"A man died and entered heaven. On his first walk about his new\r\nabode he noticed several men fettered in ball and chain. His inquiry of\r\na passer-by brought the reply, 'They came from Leeds, N. Dak., and if\r\nthey weren't chained they'd go back.'\"\r\n\r\nLeft from Leeds on a county dirt road to LAKE IBSEN, =2 m.=, named for\r\nHenrik Ibsen, Norwegian poet and dramatist. It is said that about 1858\r\na peace agreement between the Sioux and Chippewa Indians was made at\r\nthis lake, a treaty well observed by both tribes. Small islands in the\r\nlake were known to explorers of the region as Petites Isles Aux Mortes\r\n(Fr., _small islands of the dead_), owing to the fact that the Indians\r\nhad buried many victims of a devastating smallpox epidemic here. They\r\nplaced their dead on scaffolds, the wooden frames of which were visible\r\nfrom the lake shores.\r\n\r\nYORK, =142.5 m.= (1,612 alt., 250 pop.), is another town with an\r\nEnglish name and a predominantly Scandinavian population.\r\n\r\nKNOX, =150 m.= (1,605 alt., 177 pop.), is named for John Knox, the\r\nScottish religious reformer.\r\n\r\nPLEASANT LAKE (_good camping_, _tourist accommodations_, _spring\r\nwater_), =155 m.=, is a small tree-fringed body of water which was\r\ncalled Broken Bones Lake by the Indians who camped on its shores to\r\ndry their buffalo meats. They broke the buffalo bones to remove the\r\nmarrow, which they sewed into sacks of skin and preserved for winter\r\nuse. Evidences of an Indian burial ground are found on a hill to the\r\nN. These burials are not in mounds, and the only excavations are those\r\nmade accidentally by farmers plowing the land.\r\n\r\nAt =156 m.= is the railway station of PLEASANT LAKE (1,603 alt., 33\r\npop.), where tribal dances were performed on the town site by a group\r\nof Indians as recently as 1883. Some of the settlers feared that the\r\nritual was a war dance, but the Indians did no harm.\r\n\r\nAt =163.5 m.= is the junction with ND 3, a graveled highway. At this\r\ncrossroads is a stone cairn marking the GEOGRAPHIC CENTER OF NORTH\r\nAMERICA. In 1931 the U. S, Geological Survey determined that the\r\ngeographic center of the continent is in Pierce County, N. Dak., and\r\nthe marker at the highway junction is in the approximate center of the\r\ncounty. The survey states, \"The geographic center of an area may be\r\ndefined as that point on which the surface of the area would balance\r\nif it were a plane of uniform thickness, or in other words, the center\r\nof gravity of the surface.... It would not be feasible, therefore, to\r\nspecify for such a large irregular area as that of North America the\r\nexact section, township and range in which the geographic center lies.\"\r\nSome years before 1931 Pierre, S. Dak., claimed to be the approximate\r\ncenter of the continent, based on the fact that two lines drawn from\r\ncorner to corner of a map of North America intersected near Pierre.\r\n\r\nRight on ND 3 is RUGBY, =1 m.= (1,562 alt., 1,512 pop.), Pierce County\r\nseat, named for Rugby, England. It was platted in July 1885 and the\r\nfirst train arrived a month later. In the CITY HALL is a museum (_open\r\nweekdays, 9-5_) containing, among other things, Indian artifacts found\r\nin the county and Spanish-American War relics. ELLERY PARK and the\r\ntourist camp are in the western part of town. Rugby was the home of\r\nthe late N. P. Lindberg, who is said to have originated the slogan,\r\n_Say It With Flowers_. It is said that in the course of a talk made\r\nat a national florists' convention in Chicago he remarked, \"In North\r\nDakota we say it with flowers.\" His words caught the fancy of his\r\nfellow delegates, who adopted them as a slogan. His florist shop and\r\ngreenhouse, now operated by a son-in-law, are in the eastern part of\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nTUNBRIDGE, =168.5 m.= (1,509 alt., 15 pop.), and BERWICK, =174.5 m.=\r\n(1,484 alt., 100 pop.), are small hamlets R. of the route. Although the\r\nlatter town has a name of English origin, the Berwick _Post_, which\r\nsuspended publication several years ago, was published partly in German\r\nfor the large community of Russo-Germans living S. of the town.\r\n\r\nTOWNER, =183 m.= (1,478 alt., 622 pop.), named for Col. O. M. Towner,\r\none of the first ranchers in McHenry County, is the county seat. It\r\nlies in a bend of the SOURIS (Fr., _mouse_) RIVER, so named by French\r\nexplorers for the numerous field mice found in the river basin. The\r\nriver itself lies on a level plain that was at one time the bed of\r\nglacial Lake Souris, of which the stream is now the only remnant. Fully\r\nthree-fourths of McHenry County is on this plain, once principally\r\ncattle country, now devoted to diversified farming.\r\n\r\nDuring ranching days in the 1880's the country was a rough frontier\r\npopulated by an odd assortment of personalities. Among these were two\r\nEnglish peers, each of whom acquired a ranch near Towner, built a large\r\nhome, and settled down to the serious business of living lavishly on\r\nremittances from home. The community was excited when one of the men\r\nhad a visit from his sister, a countess prominent in women's suffrage\r\nwork in the British Isles, who arrived on a special train. The other\r\nexile also had a caller from home, an elderly woman who arrived\r\nunexpectedly to find him occupied with the entertainment of a houseful\r\nof guests. She departed without seeing him or even getting out of her\r\ncarriage. Not long afterwards both Englishmen took their leave.\r\n\r\nTowner is the junction with ND 14, a graveled highway, which unites\r\nwith US 2 between this point and =188 m.=\r\n\r\n1. Left from Towner on a graveled county road to the SCHULTZ HEREFORD\r\nRANCH, =1.8 m.=, where registered Hereford cattle and Belgian horses\r\nare bred. Situated on the timber-flanked banks of the Mouse, the\r\nranch has an air of early-day friendliness. Its huge barns and\r\ncorrals reflect the large-scale ranching of pioneer days joined with\r\nthe efficiency of a modern business--a combination typical of the\r\npresent-day stock raising industry in the State.\r\n\r\n2. Right (N) from Towner on a graveled county road to a GOVERNMENT\r\nNURSERY, =1.5 m.=, where experimental work in connection with the\r\nshelterbelt project is conducted.\r\n\r\n3. Right from Towner on ND 14 is BANTRY, =14 m.= (1,469 alt., 150\r\npop.). Left from Bantry on ND 17, a graveled highway, to the LONG\r\nTURKEY RANCH, =20.5 m.= At the age of six weeks the young turkeys are\r\nsent out on the 320-acre range in flocks of 700, and attain their full\r\nbone growth during the summer months. A few weeks before fall marketing\r\nthe flocks are driven in to the ranch and the birds confined in large\r\npens where they are fattened for market. More than 2,000 turkeys are\r\nshipped from the Long ranch annually.\r\n\r\nAt =188 m.= is a junction with ND 14.\r\n\r\nLeft on this graveled highway to the junction with a dirt road, =1.5\r\nm.=; R. here to the EATON DAM, =3.3 m.=, which irrigates 6,800 acres\r\nof meadowland. This water adds to the productivity of the heavy native\r\ngrasses from which many hundreds of tons of hay are cut each year.\r\nAt the close of the haying season the river bottoms are dotted with\r\nhundreds of small, mound-like haystacks resembling huge grain shocks in\r\na field of giant wheat. In the time between haying and fall the grasses\r\nattain a second growth, and cover the meadowlands around the stacks\r\nwith a luxurious green carpet that contrasts with the dingy brown of\r\nthe autumnal stubblefields through which the Souris courses.\r\n\r\nAt =196.5 m.= (L) are the DENBIGH REFORESTATION PROJECT HEADQUARTERS.\r\nThe feasibility of growing trees in poor, sandy soil and semiarid\r\nclimate is being tested on a 640-acre tract by the Northern Plains\r\nbranch of the Lake States Forest Experimental Station. The results\r\nsecured will serve as a guide for work in similar areas of other States.\r\n\r\nGRANVILLE, =207 m.= (1,513 alt., 450 pop.), named for Granville M.\r\nDodge, G. N. Ry. civil engineer, is in a level agricultural area\r\nW. of the sand hills bordering the Mouse River. A condition common\r\nin homesteading days drew this worried comment from the Granville\r\n_Record_ in 1904: \"It is a great wonder this country has advanced and\r\nis developing as rapidly as it is with so many old bachelors who do\r\nnot improve their places and so many old maids holding down claims. It\r\nought to cause a blush of shame to mount the face of every bald-headed\r\nold bachelor in the vicinity.\"\r\n\r\nAt =216 m.= is NORWICH (1,529 alt., 100 pop.), named by the G. N. Ry.\r\ntown site company for an English town.\r\n\r\nWest of SURREY, =222.5 m.= (1,627 alt., 125 pop.), the route begins\r\nthe gradual descent to a second crossing of the Mouse River. In the\r\ndistance to the W. and S. of the river, the hills rise to the Missouri\r\nPlateau.\r\n\r\nMINOT, =230.5 m.= (1,557 alt., 16,099 pop.) (_see_ MINOT).\r\n\r\n  _Points of Interest:_ Minot State Teachers College, Roosevelt Park\r\n  and Zoo.\r\n\r\nAt Valley St. and 4th Ave. SE. is the junction with US 52 (_see Tour\r\n7_), which unites with US 2 at =236.5 m.= At 4th Ave. and 2nd St. SW.\r\nis the junction with US 83 (_see Tour 3_).\r\n\r\nJust W. of Minot is the (L) HIGH STEEL TRESTLE (120 ft.) of the G. N.\r\nRy., spanning Gassman Coulee. Early one morning in the 1880's a high\r\nwind blew down the wooden bridge which then stood here, and only the\r\nquick work of an engineer prevented an entire train from plunging into\r\nthe deep coulee.\r\n\r\nAt =236.5 m.= is the junction with US 52 (_see Tour 7_). A large\r\ntourist camp is L. The highway here makes an abrupt ascent to the level\r\nMissouri Plateau.\r\n\r\nAll towns along the route W. of Minot are populated principally by\r\nScandinavians.\r\n\r\nDES LACS, =245.5 m.= (1,932 alt., 205 pop.), is named for Des Lacs\r\nRiver and Lake (_see Tour 7_). The little town received publicity in\r\n1922 when it elected a complete ticket of women officials. One eastern\r\nnewspaper wrote a glowing description of a campaign torchlight parade\r\naround the city hall and told of the enthusiasm which the men of the\r\ntown felt over the winning ticket; but a writer for a women's magazine,\r\nsent out to look over the situation, was forced to report that there\r\nwas no city hall, and that \"the men were not so enthusiastic now,\r\nperhaps because they did not like to have their own backyards cleaned\r\nup.\"\r\n\r\nLONETREE, =249.5 m.= (2,002 alt., 36 pop.), was named by the railroad\r\ncompany for the one tree that was there when the rails were laid. This\r\nlittle town figured prominently in the Burlington-Minot battle for the\r\nseat of \"Imperial Ward\" County in 1888, turning the election for Minot\r\n(_see_ </sc>Minot</sc>).\r\n\r\nBERTHOLD, =253.5 m.= (2,089 alt., 511 pop.), is the center of a\r\ncertified seed potato raising area. In the late 1880's it was the\r\nnearest railhead to Fort Berthold on the Indian reservation to the S.,\r\nhence its name.\r\n\r\nAt =262 m.= the terrain becomes more rolling and from here to the\r\nMissouri River the route traverses the ALTAMONT MORAINE, a range of\r\nhills lying on the eastern portion of the Missouri Plateau, and marking\r\nthe farthest advance of the western lobe of the last or Dakota Glacier.\r\n\r\nTAGUS, =265 m.= (2,189 alt., 136 pop.), was named for a rancher named\r\nTaguson.\r\n\r\nLeft from Tagus on an unimproved dirt road to CARPENTER LAKE\r\n(_swimming_), =6 m.=\r\n\r\nBLAISDELL (L), =273 m.= (2,264 alt., 100 pop.), was named for Alfred\r\nBlaisdell, a settler who later became secretary of state of North\r\nDakota.\r\n\r\nPALERMO (L), =280.5 m.= (2,201 alt., 205 pop.), is the namesake of a\r\ncity in Sicily.\r\n\r\nRight from Palermo in the rolling hills of the glacial moraine N. and\r\nE. of the town are several small lakes containing heavy deposits of\r\nsodium sulphate (_see Side Tour 4A_).\r\n\r\nSTANLEY, =288 m.= (2,253 alt., 936 pop.), is named for one of the first\r\nhomesteaders in the area. The MOUNTRAIL COUNTY COURTHOUSE (R), topped\r\nby a cupola, is at the northern end of town. Stanley is on a nearly\r\nlevel plateau, while both to the N. and to the S. the terrain is more\r\nrolling. There is a junction here with ND 8, a graveled highway (_see\r\nSide Tour 3A_). In 1906 the Stanley _Sun_, a usually conservative\r\nnewspaper, joined other papers in the State in telling of the wonderful\r\nfertility of North Dakota soil: \"... the most productive soil on earth,\r\ninsomuch that if you stick a nail in the ground at night, it will grow\r\ninto a crowbar before morning.\"\r\n\r\nROSS, =296.5 m.= (2,292 alt., 108 pop.), was named by the railway\r\ncompany. In 1902 a group of 20 Moslem families from Damascus, Syria,\r\nfiled on homesteads SE. of Ross, and since 1909, when the Federal\r\nGovernment withdrew its objection to their naturalization, many of\r\nthem have become citizens. They are Americanized in dress, although\r\nthe women have a penchant for highly colored clothes. Many Old Country\r\nfoods are still used; one Syrian dish especially well-liked consists of\r\ndurum wheat boiled, sun-dried, ground, and screened, and stewed with\r\nmeats and vegetables or sweet oils. The dried grain is ground in a\r\nlarge horse-powered machine resembling a coffee mill.\r\n\r\nIn 1929 this colony built a basement mosque, and each Friday a\r\nmember of the congregation conducts services. Each person carefully\r\nwashes his hands and feet before entering the temple; the sexes are\r\nsegregated during prayer. During Ramadan--the ninth month according to\r\nthe Mohammedan calendar, which is lunar--the people fast for 30 days,\r\ntaking food only after dark; the month ends with a feast. The wedding\r\nceremony of the group is unusual, for the bride is not present. Before\r\nthe wedding she selects two witnesses to act in her behalf, who state\r\nthe amount of money to be exchanged between the bridegroom and her\r\nparents--the bridegroom gives the parents this amount and they return\r\nthe same amount to him. During the wedding ceremony the bride retires\r\nto another room; the father places his hand in that of the bridegroom,\r\na large kerchief is placed over the clasped hands, and a member of the\r\ncongregation reads the service. It is a custom of these people to shake\r\nhands at any chance meeting, no matter how recently they have met.\r\n\r\nAt =298.5 m.= is the junction with a graveled road.\r\n\r\nLeft on this road is SANISH (Arikaran, _real people_), =23 m.= (1,820\r\nalt., 463 pop.), lying in a valley between bluffs bordering the eastern\r\nbank of the Missouri River. Spanning the Missouri here is the VERENDRYE\r\nBRIDGE, completed in 1927, the third highway bridge built across the\r\nriver in the State. The site was known to the Indians from the earliest\r\ntimes as the Old Crossing because it was used as a ford by the large\r\nbuffalo herds in their annual migrations. Adjoining Sanish on the S.\r\nis VERENDRYE NATIONAL MONUMENT, in which is CROW FLIES HIGH BUTTE,\r\nnamed for an Hidatsa Indian chieftain. On this butte is a monument\r\ndedicated to the Verendryes, who are believed to have visited one of\r\nthe agricultural Indian tribes here on their exploratory trip into\r\npresent North Dakota in 1738. The site discovered near Menoken in 1936,\r\nhowever, may be more definitely established as the village they visited\r\n(_see Tour 8_).\r\n\r\nMANITOU (Chippewa, _the Great Spirit_), =302.5 m.= (2,282 alt., 24\r\npop.), founded when the G. N. Ry. built through the territory in 1887,\r\ntoday consists of only a consolidated school, a store, and an elevator.\r\n\r\nWHITE EARTH, =310.5 m.= (2,099 alt., 240 pop.), founded in 1891,\r\nprobably was named for the fine, white, clayey sand which has washed\r\ndown into the White Earth River valley. It overlies the Laramie\r\nformation, which is exposed in many places on the sides of the valley,\r\n150 ft. deep here. While diversified farming predominates in the\r\nvicinity, traces of the old West are still found on a few small ranches\r\nalong the White Earth River between the route and the Missouri River to\r\nthe S.\r\n\r\nTIOGA (Iroquois, _beautiful valley_), =321.5 m.= (2,241 alt., 435\r\npop.), was founded in 1902.\r\n\r\nRAY, =335 m.= (2,271 alt., 621 pop.), named for Al G. Ray, chief\r\nspecial agent for the G. N. Ry. when the town was established in 1902,\r\nis scattered on level land along the railroad right-of-way. It was one\r\nof the first towns in the United States to adopt a commission form of\r\ncity government (1910).\r\n\r\n1. Right from Ray on a graveled county road to the WILLIAM SIMPSON FARM\r\nHOME, =8 m.=, where there is an unusual COLLECTION (_open_) of South\r\nAfrican oddities, collected by Simpson, a Scotchman, who during several\r\nyears there obtained animal skins, beads, heads, and horns from the\r\nnatives.\r\n\r\n2. Left from Ray on a dirt graded county highway to the junction with\r\nanother road, =10 m.=; L. here to the first WELL AND DERRICK of the\r\nBig Viking Oil Company, on the Nesson Flats, =17 m.=, a level bench\r\njust above the Missouri River opposite the mouth of TOBACCO GARDEN\r\nCREEK (_see Tour 10_). Interest in a prospective oil field here led to\r\na 40-day $25,000 survey and the expenditure of $195,000 in test well\r\ndrilling by the Standard Oil Company of California in 1937. More than\r\n200,000 acres in oil leases were taken up in the vicinity, and the\r\ncompany plans (1938) to expend another $200,000 before completing the\r\ntest drilling.\r\n\r\nOpposite Nesson Flats near the mouth of Tobacco Garden Creek an attack\r\nupon a river steamer was made by a Sioux war party July 7, 1863. The\r\nSioux, goaded to hostility by repeated violations of treaties and\r\ncorrupt handling of annuity goods by governmental agencies, had met the\r\n_Robert Campbell_ at Fort Pierre, S. Dak., to ask for the goods due\r\nthem. When Samuel M. Latta, Indian agent in charge of distribution of\r\nthe boat's cargo--a newcomer in the Indian service, arrogant and none\r\ntoo scrupulous--withheld one-third of the goods, the Indians vowed to\r\nfollow the boat up the river to Fort Benton, its destination. For 600\r\nmiles they harassed the steamer, pouring shots into it at every vantage\r\npoint, attacking the crew at each woodyard, and making life miserable\r\nfor all on board.\r\n\r\nAt that time the river at the mouth of Tobacco Garden Creek was quite\r\nnarrow, and the Indians chose this spot for a massed attack. Joseph\r\nLaBarge, captain of the =Robert Campbell=, realizing the hazards of\r\nsteaming through this point, made his boat fast to the opposite bank to\r\nprepare for a parley. The Sioux sent word that they wanted no trouble,\r\nonly the annuity goods due them. Latta, however, refused to give up\r\nthe goods, and suggested sending a yawl ashore to negotiate with the\r\nIndians. The Sioux consented, provided Latta came ashore. He, in turn,\r\nagreed to go, but when the yawl was ready he became conveniently ill in\r\nhis cabin.\r\n\r\nThe yawl went ashore and had hardly landed when the Indians, angered\r\nby Latta's perfidy, attacked the crew. Three were killed and another\r\nwounded before the crew of the steamer opened fire, killing 18 Indians\r\nand 20 horses. The slain white men were buried next day on a bluff\r\nopposite the mouth of the Little Muddy Creek, where the city of\r\nWilliston now stands (_see below_).\r\n\r\nWHEELOCK, =342 m.= (2,387 alt., 115 pop.), named for Ralph W. Wheelock,\r\nan editorial writer on the Minneapolis (Minn.) _Tribune_ in the early\r\n1900's, is the highest point of elevation on the G. N. Ry. in North\r\nDakota.\r\n\r\nLeft from Wheelock on an improved dirt road to the junction with\r\nan unimproved dirt road, =5 m.=; L. here =3 m.= to HUNGRY GULCH, a\r\npleasant ravine on Tobacco Garden Creek. From the base of one hill\r\nbubbles a spring of clear water, and level areas under clumps of\r\ntrees invite picnic spreads on the banks of the creek. Along the\r\nstream is a deposit of \"fool's gold\", or pyrite, which in 1902 had\r\ngold prospectors agog in anticipation of wealth. The story is told\r\nthat, in the rush to stake claims here, James Moorman, on whose land\r\nthe \"strike\" was made, was the only person to benefit. He made a\r\nsubstantial profit selling the hungry prospectors his small stock of\r\nflour, in the form of pancakes, at exorbitant prices. When the supply\r\nwas exhausted and appetites still were not satisfied, Moorman told them\r\nhe would peel bark from the trees for them to eat. The ravine has since\r\nbeen known as Hungry Gulch.\r\n\r\nSouth of the junction with unimproved road to SEVEN MILE HILL, =7 m.=,\r\na large, fairly level elevation over which passed the old trail used by\r\nfur traders, soldiers, and travelers between Bismarck and Williston.\r\nBlue Buttes, prominent peaks in the Badlands across the Missouri,\r\nare visible in the SE. on a clear day; N. and E. is an expanse of\r\nprairie; and to the S. and W. the Missouri, with its wooded banks and\r\nlowlands, winds to the horizon. Near the foot of the hill is CUSAC\r\nSPRINGS FARM (R), where a skirmish apparently unrecorded in military\r\nannals--possibly between Indians and soldiers--took place near a\r\nspring. Rifle pits are still visible, and rifle shells and human bones\r\nhave been found in them.\r\n\r\nEPPING, =348.5 m.= (2,224 alt., 183 pop.), named for Epping, in\r\nEngland, lies on the southern slope of one of the many rolling hills of\r\nthe prairie.\r\n\r\nLeft from Epping on a graveled county road, formerly US 2, to the\r\nEPPING-SPRINGBROOK DAM, =5 m.=, largest earthfill dam in the State.\r\nConstructed as an FERA and WPA project, it was completed in 1936. This\r\nbulwark on STONY CREEK has created a lake covering 180 acres, which,\r\nincluding a strip of land around the water, will be made into a State\r\npark devoted entirely to recreation. A six-inch pipe will make a flow\r\nof water available for a limited amount of irrigation below the dam.\r\n\r\nAt =358 m.= the tableland of the Missouri Plateau comes to an abrupt\r\nend, and the highway descends into the valley of LITTLE MUDDY CREEK.\r\nFrom the top of the hill leading into this valley there is a panorama\r\nof level land dotted with farmhouses, and in the distance to the L. are\r\nthe Missouri River and Williston.\r\n\r\nAt =359 m.= is the junction with an unimproved private road.\r\n\r\nRight on this road to the OASIS GARDENS, =0.5 m.=, a private truck farm\r\nwhere irrigation has been successfully employed.\r\n\r\nAt =361 m.= is the junction with US 85 (_see Tour 4_), a graveled\r\nhighway. US 2 and 85 are one route to =375.5 m.=\r\n\r\nAt =367.5 m.= is the junction with a graveled driveway.\r\n\r\nLeft on this driveway to the twin artificial lakes known as LAKE\r\nMINNEKOSH (Sioux, _twin waters_), =0.3 m.= These lakes, built under a\r\nFederal project, are formed by dammed springs (_sand beaches_, _diving\r\ntowers_, _bathing houses_).\r\n\r\nWILLISTON, =370.5 m.= (1,861 alt., 5,106 pop.), was named by James J.\r\nHill, builder and first president of the G. N. Ry., for his friend S.\r\nWillis James of New York City, who was one of the stockholders in the\r\ncompany. The JAMES MEMORIAL LIBRARY, cor. 1st Ave. W. and 7th St., is a\r\ngift of the James family.\r\n\r\nA large residential district and an active business section form\r\nthe city, which is Williams County seat and the trade center for a\r\nlarge agricultural area in northwestern North Dakota and northeastern\r\nMontana. It lies on a gravelly terrace between the lowlands of the\r\nMissouri River and the hills and prairies. The river, which at one\r\ntime flowed at the foot of Main St. and now has cut its channel\r\nnearly a mile to the S., has played a prominent part in the history\r\nof the locality. Up it came Lewis and Clark in 1805 on their historic\r\nexpedition to the Pacific coast. In 1832 the _Yellowstone_, first\r\nsteamboat to navigate the upper Missouri, passed the site, and by 1860\r\nseveral boats were plying the stream. For 20 years after the gold\r\nstrike in Montana in 1863 and 1864 the river was the major channel of\r\ncommunication to the Northwest.\r\n\r\nThe first white settler in the vicinity was Robert Matthews, employed\r\nby the post traders at Fort Buford to cut hay for the cavalry horses.\r\nIn the 1870's he established himself some distance below the present\r\ntown, near where Stony Creek flows into the Little Muddy. Here he kept\r\na stock of goods for sale, and often hired crews of woodcutters to\r\nsupply the demand for fuel for the steamboats. A post office known as\r\nLittle Muddy was established on his ranch.\r\n\r\nAlthough Matthews was the first permanent settler in the immediate\r\nWilliston area, the first white man to settle in Williams County\r\noutside a trading or military post was George Grinnell. Born in\r\nMaryland, he served as a spy for Gen. Philip H. Sheridan in the Army\r\nof the Potomac, was honorably discharged, and in 1865 accompanied a\r\nmilitary wagon train from Fort Snelling, Minn., to Fort Berthold. The\r\nnext year found him established as a \"woodhawk\", furnishing fuel to\r\nthe steamboats, near the mouth of Dry Fork Creek, where he operated a\r\nsawmill until advised that he was on Government property. Part of each\r\nyear he hunted along the Missouri, and for a time in 1875 was with a\r\nparty of gold seekers in the Musselshell country of Montana.\r\n\r\nIt was common practice of the period for hunters, traders, or trappers\r\nto select a \"woman of convenience\" from among the Indians. In many\r\ninstances these women were mistreated and even held in contempt by\r\nthe very men who took them from their tribes. Grinnell was one of\r\nthese men. In his earlier days along the Missouri he lived with a\r\npure-blooded Indian woman, later discarding her for an educated and\r\ntalented half-breed, Josephine Manuri. One bitter cold winter day\r\nJosephine's small son had wandered from the house and been lost.\r\nSeveral men were ready to search for the youngster but Grinnell,\r\nwishing to show his contempt for his wife, threatened to kill the first\r\nman to go after him. In the group was George Newton, buffalo hunter\r\nand pioneer Williston businessman, who replied, \"Then you've got me to\r\nkill,\" and went out and brought the child back to his mother.\r\n\r\nOne day in 1888, coming from his saloon where he had been drinking\r\nheavily, Grinnell began to abuse his wife, who ran from him to a nearby\r\nfield where several men were plowing. Too drunk to pursue her on foot,\r\nhe mounted his horse and followed her to the field where, in an attempt\r\nto strike her with the butt of his pistol, he fell from his horse,\r\ncarrying his wife down with him. The two struggled for several minutes,\r\nnone of the bystanders daring to interfere for fear of his gun.\r\nSuddenly Grinnell relaxed and lay quiet. He was in the habit of wearing\r\naround his neck a long leather watch thong with a sliding knot, and in\r\nthe struggle his wife had clung to this thong and strangled him. After\r\nascertaining that Grinnell was dead one of the onlookers remarked,\r\n\"Let's go get a drink,\" and they all retired to his saloon, leaving the\r\nbody as it was. Later a coroner's jury at Williston absolved the woman\r\nof all blame in the death of her husband with the unique verdict that\r\nGrinnell \"... came to his death through an act of Almighty God, by the\r\nhand of His agent, Josephine Grinnell.\"\r\n\r\nWith the coming of the railroad Williston was moved to higher ground\r\nfarther W. It was only a tent colony and a few log cabins when the\r\nrails were laid into it in 1887, and it was said to have had a saloon\r\non each corner of its one business block, with seven or eight others\r\nbetween. The late Joseph Stroud, pioneer Williston merchant, related\r\nthat on the occasion of his first visit to the new town he was\r\nattracted by a large crowd of men on the street, engaged in rolling\r\na man over a barrel. Inquiring of a bystander as to the cause of the\r\nman's accident, he was informed that the victim had taken a drink of\r\nwater by mistake.\r\n\r\nBy 1900 a steady influx of homesteaders into the Williston area\r\nhad begun, and by 1910 the most desirable lands in the surrounding\r\nterritory had been settled. Williston's population of 5,000, which has\r\nfluctuated little in the last 20 years, was attained by 1915.\r\n\r\nAn important factor in the rapid growth of the city was the location\r\nhere of the division headquarters of the G. N. Ry. The roundhouse, car\r\nrepair shop, and huge ice house require the services of a large force\r\nof men. The railroad stockyards E. of the city accommodate 93 carloads\r\nof livestock, and have loading equipment for 23 cars; many trainloads,\r\nof western sheep and cattle are fed in transit annually. On several\r\noccasions a million bushels of grain have been handled at Williston in\r\na year. The city is an important primary turkey market, and thousands\r\nof birds are shipped to holiday markets each year.\r\n\r\nThe Farmers Educational and Cooperative Union of America has entitled\r\nWilliston the _Cooperative City of North Dakota_. The FARMERS UNION\r\nCOOPERATIVE CREAMERY, rated as the largest enterprise of its kind in\r\nthe State, has its modern plant on W. Broadway. On W. 2nd St. (US 2 and\r\n85) is the FARMERS UNION OIL CO. PLANT, which maintains a wholesale\r\ndepartment for oils, tires, and binder twine, and has a tractor and\r\nfarm machinery repair division. On W. 1st St. is the FARMERS NATIONAL\r\nWAREHOUSE CORP. BUILDING, a concrete elevator with 217,000 bu.\r\ncapacity, said to be the largest cooperatively owned primary grain\r\nwarehouse in the United States. Newest of the cooperatives is the\r\nPOULTRY PLANT on W. 2nd St. at the outskirts of the city.\r\n\r\nIn RECREATION PARK, between 2nd and 3rd Aves. W. and 4th and 5th Sts.\r\nW., are playground facilities, a bandstand, and a number of cages of\r\nwild animals and birds; the larger animals are kept in WESTLAWN PARK,\r\nin the northwestern part of the city. HARMON FIELD (_baseball diamond_,\r\n_football gridiron_, _cinder track_, _swimming pool_), at the northern\r\nend of Main St., was built under the Civil Works Administration. Two\r\nannual events in Williston are the Old Fiddlers Contest (_Jan._), and\r\nthe Upper Missouri Band Tournament (_1st wk. in June_).\r\n\r\nLeft from Williston on E. Broadway on a graveled Scenic Highway,\r\nfollowing the route of the old overland trail between Bismarck and\r\nFort Buford (_see Side Tour 3B_), to the junction with a graded dirt\r\nhighway at =2.5 m.=; R. here across CRAZY MAN'S COULEE, =3 m.= One day\r\nin the early 1880's Robert Matthews (see above), the first settler in\r\nthe region, was seated on the steps of his ranch house just W. of the\r\nravine when he saw a man, dressed in skins and with hair falling to his\r\nshoulders, come out of the thickets in the coulee. Matthews knew that\r\nno one lived in the country for miles around, and was interested in\r\nlearning his identity. When the man saw the ranch buildings, however,\r\nhe started away, broke into a run, and disappeared into the brush\r\nalong the creek running through the ravine. About a year later a man\r\nsimilarly dressed, perhaps the same person, came out of the brush and\r\nrepeated the performance of the previous year. Matthews remarked to his\r\nwife, \"That is surely Crazy Man's Coulee over there. That's the second\r\nwild man who has come out of it.\"\r\n\r\nLeft from Crazy Man's Coulee =1.5 m.= on an unimproved dirt road to\r\nMEDICINE LODGE SPRING (R), in the coulee farther to the E. An early\r\nhomesteader bottled and sold the mineral water of the spring. However,\r\nthe Indians had discovered its health-giving qualities many years\r\nbefore, and used to come long distances to camp here. One of their\r\nfavorite camping places was MEDICINE LODGE HILL, visible about 1 m.\r\nN. of the spring, from whose height signal fires could be seen in all\r\ndirections, and from which game or enemies could easily be sighted.\r\nAtop the hill are traces of Indian rings.\r\n\r\nSoutheast from Crazy Man's Coulee on the Scenic Highway to a junction\r\nat =5.5 m.=; L. to =11.5 m.=; R. to =13.5 m.=; L. to =15.5 m.=; R. to\r\nthe Babcock Farm, =19 m.= Right here on an unimproved trail to the Harm\r\nArends place on SPANISH POINT, =22 m.=\r\n\r\nA short distance from the Arends farm is LAKE JESSIE (_boating_,\r\n_fishing_, _swimming_), an oxbow lake formed by the changing channel of\r\nthe Missouri. The woods offer many natural camping places; the Upper\r\nMissouri District of the Great Plains Area, Boy Scouts of America,\r\nmaintains a summer camp for boys here. Spanish Point was first known as\r\nthe Spanish Woodyard, from the fact that two Mexicans in 1868 started\r\nselling fuel here to the steamers plying between St. Louis and the\r\nMontana gold fields. The Mexicans were joined by other woodcutters,\r\nand for a time the group prospered. A murder, two deaths at the hands\r\nof Indians, and other disasters, however, took their toll, and by 1870\r\nthe log cabin and stockade were deteriorating, and in a short time the\r\nriver had washed away all traces of the woodyard.\r\n\r\nWest of Williston the MISSOURI RIVER (L) is bordered on the near side\r\nby timbered bottomlands, and on the far side by high, steep buttes.\r\n\r\nAt =375.5 m.= is the junction (L) with US 85 (_see Tour 4_), and at\r\n=387.5 m.= is the junction with a county graveled road (_see Side Tour\r\n6B_). The route crosses the Montana Line at =390.5 m.=, 132 m. E. of\r\nGlasgow, Mont. (_see Mont. Tour 2_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIDE TOUR 6A\r\n\r\n\r\n  Devils Lake (city)--Camp Grafton--Devils Lake--Fort Totten Indian\r\n  Agency--Sully's Hill National Game Preserve--Devils Lake (city). ND\r\n  20, ND 57, and Indian Service roads.\r\n\r\n  Devils Lake to Devils Lake, 33 m.\r\n\r\n  Graveled roadbed.\r\n\r\n  No accommodations along route.\r\n\r\nThis circular route from the city of Devils Lake along the beautifully\r\nwooded southern shore of the lake passes the homes of the Sioux and\r\nChippewa Indians near the Fort Totten Agency, and many points connected\r\nwith Indian life and legend.\r\n\r\nND 20 branches S. from US 2 in DEVILS LAKE, =0.0 m.= (_see Tour 6_).\r\n\r\nSouth of the city is level farming land, once the bed of a shallow\r\nglacial sea of which DEVILS LAKE, =5 m.=, is a remnant. The name is the\r\nwhite man's misinterpretation of the Sioux name Minnewaukan, _mystery_,\r\nor _spirit water_. Approximately 30 m. by 10 m., the lake is narrow\r\nand extremely irregular, with many little bays and peninsulas, and\r\nis surrounded by high morainic hills which, particularly along the\r\nsouthern shore, are heavily wooded. The clear water is strongly\r\nimpregnated with sulphite, sodium carbonate, lime, magnesium, and\r\niron--much like the water of oceans. It has been calculated that at\r\nthe time of origin several thousand years ago the lake had a depth of\r\n56 ft. A fall of 21 ft. is shown between that time and the Government\r\nland survey of 1883, and a further fall of more than 26 ft. in the\r\nhalf century since. At the time of the survey fish were plentiful in\r\nthe lake, and each spring in the early 1880's the settlers caught them\r\nwith pitchforks and took them away by the wagonload. In 1888, for some\r\nreason never clearly explained, the fish disappeared from the lake, and\r\nby 1909 the water level had fallen so far that commercial shipping on\r\nthe lake was discontinued (_see Tour 6_). The sudden recession of the\r\nlake is attributed to the lack of ground and surface water in North\r\nDakota, and has constituted a strong argument for the proposed Missouri\r\nRiver diversion project which would store water from the Missouri and\r\ndivert it for use in the eastern part of this State and South Dakota,\r\nand in western Minnesota.\r\n\r\nMany legends concerning Devils Lake have been handed down by the\r\nIndians. One tells of two Indian braves who were talking and smoking\r\non the shore, when one of them idly thrust his knife into a large log\r\nlying on the water's edge. The log slid into the lake, and the men saw\r\nthat it was a huge sea monster. Some say this serpent still lives in\r\na hole in the bottom of the lake, and can be seen at times; that the\r\nwater rises and boils when he comes out of his lair; that he leaves the\r\nlake at night to sleep on the shore.\r\n\r\nAnother story relates how a victorious party of Sioux warriors, who\r\nhad attacked the Chippewa against the advice of Owanda the Seer, were\r\nswallowed up by the lake as they returned across its surface from the\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nPhantom ships are the subject of a number of stories told by both white\r\npeople and Indians. Under proper atmospheric conditions the waters of\r\nthe lake throw off a vapor through which birds swimming on the surface\r\ncan be seen from a distance highly magnified and resembling ships\r\nmoving on the lake.\r\n\r\nAt =5 m.= is a junction with a graveled road.\r\n\r\nRight on this road is LAKEWOOD PARK (_cottages can be rented_; _due\r\nto low water level, lake unsuitable for bathing here_ (_1938_); _band\r\nconcerts_, _dancing_, _baseball_, _and boating_), =1 m.=, (1,460\r\nalt., 200 pop.), on an attractive arm of the lake known as Creel's\r\nBay. The settlement grew up about a Chautauqua movement which was\r\ninaugurated in 1892, continued for more than 35 years, and became the\r\nthird largest in the country (1911). During Chautauqua season in the\r\nearly days steamboats, including the _Minnie H_. (_see Tour 6_), made\r\ndaily excursions to points of interest on the lake. The Chautauqua\r\nassociation had its own railway from the park to Devils Lake, and on\r\nsome occasions special trains were run on all lines leading into the\r\ncity. The point is still a popular summer resort.\r\n\r\nAt =6 m.=, at the \"Narrows\" of the lake, which is now only about 400\r\nft. wide, is a junction with a graveled road.\r\n\r\nRight on this road to CAMP GRAFTON, =2.5 m.=, where field training\r\nof the North Dakota National Guard has been conducted annually since\r\n1904. Named for Lt. Col. Gilbert C. Grafton, who died in the World War,\r\nthe camp covers about 6 of the 180 sq. m. that once composed the Fort\r\nTotten military reserve. Two-week maneuvers are held in June, usually\r\nearly in the month, with 21 units, totaling approximately 1,100 troops,\r\nparticipating. The high light of the training events is Governor's Day,\r\nthe second Sunday of the period, when the camp is put on dress parade\r\nfor inspection by the chief executive of the State, who is commander in\r\nchief of its armed forces.\r\n\r\nAt =6.5 m.= on ND 20 is a junction with ND 57, now the tour route.\r\n\r\nLeft on ND 20 to the junction with a graveled county road, =10 m.=; R.\r\nhere is TOKIO, =10.8 m.= (1,501 alt., 112 pop.), near the center of the\r\noriginal Fort Totten Indian Reservation.\r\n\r\nRight from Tokio =1.5 m.= on a county dirt road to the DEVIL'S\r\nHEART, highest point in the Devils Lake area. For the Sioux it was a\r\ntraditional meeting place to discuss war, hunting, or other ventures,\r\nand their name for it, in translation, means _center of the region_.\r\nAny promise made by an Indian on this hill is said to be sacred, and\r\nmust be conscientiously fulfilled. Father J. B. Genin, one of the\r\nearliest missionaries to the Indians of this region, erected a cross\r\non the crest of the hill March 4, 1868, and at the same time announced\r\nthat Devils Lake was to be known as St. Michael's Lake, but the change\r\nwas never popularly adopted, and lake and town still bear the ancient\r\nmystic Indian name. From the top of Devil's Heart there is an excellent\r\npanorama of the entire lake region.\r\n\r\nSouth from Tokio on the county graveled road to a junction at =11 m.=;\r\nR. to =12.3 m.=; L. to WOOD LAKE (_tourist and camping facilities_;\r\n_boating_, _fishing supplies_), =13.3 m.=, a small wooded body of\r\nwater. Fishing is good during open season (_May 15-Nov. 1 for perch_,\r\n_June 5-Nov. 1 for crappie_). In June and July a boys' camp is operated\r\nhere by the Devils Lake Boy Scouts. On the northwestern shore is the\r\nBENSON COUNTY PARK (_picnicking and camping_), a 40-acre tract improved\r\nunder the Works Progress Administration in 1937.\r\n\r\nBetween its junction with ND 20 and Fort Totten, ND 57 winds along\r\nthe lake shore at the foot of the high, tree-clad range, and is known\r\nas the Burtness Scenic Highway, in honor of O. B. Burtness of Grand\r\nForks (1884-), who as a Congressman from North Dakota (1921-27) was\r\ninfluential in obtaining funds for construction of the road.\r\n\r\nAt =11.3 m.= on ND 57 is a junction with a trail.\r\n\r\nLeft on this trail to the SKI SLIDE, =0.5 m.=, of the Lake Region Ski\r\nClub. Each year (_Feb._) riders from all parts of the United States\r\nparticipate in the tournament held here.\r\n\r\nAt =13.3 m.= is a MONUMENT TO FATHER JEROME HUNT, who served St.\r\nMichael's Mission (_see below_) almost 40 years. With the help of\r\na young Indian, Ignatius Court, whom he sent to the office of the\r\nDevils Lake _News_ to learn the art of printing, he published a small\r\nnewspaper, two prayer books, and Bible stories, all in the Siouan\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nFORT TOTTEN, =14 m.= (1,470 alt., 1,250 pop., including town and\r\nreservation), with its uniform white agency buildings primly facing a\r\ncentral square, was originally a military post established in 1867 as a\r\nstep in the plan to place the Indians of the region on a reservation.\r\nThe reservation, named for Gen. Gilbert Totten, then Chief, Engineer\r\nCorps, U. S. Army, was established through a treaty in 1867 with the\r\nSisseton, Wahpeton, and Cut-Head Sioux. On July 17, 1867, Gen. A. H.\r\nTerry, commander of the Department of Dakota, arrived on the southern\r\nshore of Devils Lake with three companies of the Thirty-First U. S.\r\nInfantry, to establish the post. The original fort was of logs, and\r\nstill stands half a mile S. of the brick buildings that replaced it in\r\n1868. The bricks for the fort were made on the reservation, and, with\r\nthe exception of present Fort Lincoln (_see Tour 8_), built much later,\r\nthis is considered the best-built fort in the history of North Dakota.\r\n\r\nPrincipally used as troops' winter quarters, the post sometimes had\r\nas many as five companies and at other times only one. Fort Totten\r\ntroops acted as escorts for surveyors of the N. P. Ry. and for the\r\nInternational Boundary Line Commission, and participated in various\r\ncampaigns in Dakota and Montana, returning to the fort for the winter.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Indians of the region were usually quite peaceable, there\r\nwas occasional trouble with them, particularly on the route to Fort\r\nStevenson along the Missouri (_see Tour 10_). This trail constituted\r\nthe main channel of transportation and communication for Fort Totten in\r\nits early days. An anonymous poem describes what is said to have been\r\nan actual occurrence (although the date given is not correct) in which\r\nJosh Murphy and Charlie Reynolds--General Custer's scout on the Black\r\nHills expedition, who died with Custer at the Little Big Horn (_see_\r\nHISTORY)--are carrying the mail into Fort Totten.\r\n\r\n    \"It was in the spring of sixty-four,\r\n    Just a little while ere the war was o'er,\r\n    That 'twas mine the mail bags to transport\r\n    From Stevenson Pass to Totten fort;\r\n    Through the rugged passes the route to take\r\n    O'er the mountains that frown on Devils Lake;\r\n    Those canyons alive with skulking crews\r\n    Of the Chippewas and the savage Sioux;\r\n    But my heart felt light and my arm felt strong\r\n    For brave Josh Murphy rode along.\"\r\n\r\nJosh is shot by Indians and begs his companion to prevent them from\r\ntaking his scalp. Charlie lifts the dying man to his saddle and Josh's\r\npony dashes into the night.\r\n\r\n    \"We sought for Josh and we struck his trail\r\n    In the dew damp notes of the scattered mail;\r\n    And we found him at last, scarce a pistol shot\r\n    From the picket wall of the fort he sought.\r\n    There he proudly lay with his unscalped head\r\n    On the throbless breast of his pony--dead!\r\n    And the route from the pass to the cedared hill\r\n    Is known as the 'Deadman's Journey' still.\"\r\n\r\nThe garrison was withdrawn from Fort Totten in 1890, and the mission\r\nschool, which had been conducted by the Grey Nuns of Montreal since\r\n1874, was consolidated with the Indian Industrial School and housed\r\nwith the agency offices in the fort buildings. Approximately 1,000\r\nSioux and a small number of Chippewa--many of both tribes are now of\r\nmixed blood--are under jurisdiction of the agency. At the school here\r\nthe boys are taught dairying, gardening, carpentry, shoe repairing,\r\nsteam and electrical engineering, baking, and tailoring; and the girls,\r\nsewing, laundering, cooking, and housekeeping.\r\n\r\nAt the auditorium (_last wk. Feb._) is held the annual Midwinter Fair.\r\nAnother annual fair is held (_1st wk. Sept._) on the fairgrounds\r\nadjoining the agency on the NW. To both of these a few Indians bring\r\nhandicraft work for sale; elsewhere such work is scarce, though\r\nbeadwork and certain primitive musical instruments--flutes of red\r\ncedar, whistles of bone, large drums, tom-toms, rattles, and string\r\nbells--can be obtained at some of the homes.\r\n\r\nThe reservation, with its wooded hills and ravines, and its numerous\r\nlakes, is a beautiful region. Originally covering 360 sq. m., it has\r\nbeen reduced to 137,000 acres. The land is allotted in 60-acre tracts\r\nto a family, and some farming is done. The economic status of the\r\nIndians here is poor, however.\r\n\r\nAt Fort Totten is the junction (L) with a graveled Indian Service road,\r\nfrom this point the tour route.\r\n\r\nRight from Fort Totten on ND 57 to the INDIAN RESETTLEMENT TRACT (R),\r\n=0.5 m.=, where the Government has constructed 13 new homes for the\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nAt =2 m.= on ND 57 are the DEVIL'S EARS, two long hills through which\r\nthe highway runs. A man passing between these hills loses his mind,\r\naccording to Indian legend, but regains it as soon as he comes out\r\nof the valley. The Indians are reluctant to discuss these hills with\r\nstrangers; for while their pre-Christian philosophy included no devils,\r\nthe hills were believed to have some connection with the Great Mystery\r\nor Great Spirit.\r\n\r\nOn the graveled Indian Service road is the 800-acre SULLY'S HILL\r\nNATIONAL GAME PRESERVE, =15.5 m.= (_no admission charge_; _picnic\r\nshelters_, _playgrounds_, _pure water_, _camping facilities_; _vehicles\r\nnot allowed within fenced area_). Trees and shrubs cover the hills\r\nof the park almost to their peaks, and tiny lakes dot the valleys,\r\nmaking this a beautiful spot. The park and its highest point, Sully's\r\nHill, are named for Gen. Alfred H. Sully, to commemorate his Indian\r\nexpeditions into North Dakota. A high woven-wire fence encloses small\r\nherds of buffalo, elk, and deer, also wild fowl. Some of the animals\r\nare quite tame, and amuse visitors with their antics. More than 14,000\r\npeople visited the park in 1935.\r\n\r\nThe DEVIL'S TOOTH (L), =17 m.=, a boulder about 6 ft. high and 5\r\nft. square at the base, resembles a tooth with its roots extending\r\nupward. This rock is greatly revered by the Indians, who tell that\r\nan Indian mother wandered over the hill one day carrying her child,\r\nand disappeared. Searchers, looking for her in vain, found this large\r\nstone, which had not been here before, and concluded it was the\r\nspirit of the woman and child. The stone has since had a reputation\r\nof connection with evil spirits. Gifts are often left here by Indians\r\nwhen a relative has died, but it is said that other Indians sometimes\r\nappropriate these offerings. It is an old custom for an Indian to give\r\naway part or even all of his possessions after the death of a loved one.\r\n\r\nAt =19 m.= L. on a graveled Indian Service road.\r\n\r\nAt =21 m.= (R) is small, attractive COURT LAKE (_charge of 10c per day\r\nor 25c per wk. for use of bathing beach_), named for Ignatius Court,\r\nthe Indian who helped Father Hunt print a Siouan newspaper in the\r\nearly days of St. Michael's Mission, and who served for many years as\r\nofficial interpreter at the Fort Totten Agency.\r\n\r\nAt =21.8 m.= is a junction with a graveled Indian Service road (L), now\r\nthe route.\r\n\r\nRight on this road is ST. MICHAEL, =2 m.= (1,470 alt., 180 pop.), at\r\nthe foot of Mission Hill, which affords a good view of the surrounding\r\ncountry. Here is ST. MICHAEL'S MISSION, established in 1874 by the\r\nGrey Nuns order of the Roman Catholic Church, through the efforts of\r\nMaj. William H. Forbes, first Indian agent on the reservation. At the\r\nmission lived and worked Father Jerome Hunt (_see above_).

Hugh E. Scott and Gen. William H.\r\nHazen.\r\n\r\nThe route, an unmarked gravel road, branches S. from US 2 (_see Tour\r\n6_) 17 m. W. of Williston. At =8 m.= is BUFORD (1,950 alt., 52 pop.), a\r\nlittle village named for the old fort. At =8.5 m.= is the junction with\r\nan unimproved road; L. here.\r\n\r\nOn the SITE OF FORT BUFORD, =9 m.=, a stone powder house and the\r\nregimental headquarters buildings still stand; the military cemetery is\r\nto the S.\r\n\r\nIn 1828 John Jacob Astor's American Fur Co. built its principal\r\npost on the upper Missouri, Fort Union, 3 m. up the Missouri from\r\nthe mouth of the Yellowstone, a few hundred yards E. of the present\r\nMontana Line. For almost 40 years Fort Union was the most important\r\ntrading post in the Dakotas. Unfortunately, the traders at the post\r\nwere more interested in getting furs cheaply than in preserving the\r\nmorale of the Indians of the region. Whiskey, although prohibited,\r\nflowed freely. Quarrels between the Indians and the white men were\r\nfrequent. Conditions were so bad in 1864 when Gen. Alfred Sully made a\r\nvisit to the post following his campaign against the Sioux (_see Tour\r\n8 and Side Tour 8D_), that he recommended Government control of the\r\ntrading posts if peace were ever to be made with the Indians. Upon his\r\nrecommendation, therefore, Fort Buford was established in June 1866\r\nopposite the mouth of the Yellowstone. Fort Union was dismantled and\r\nits materials were brought here for use in building the new post.\r\n\r\nBecause of its strategic position, the new fort, named for Gen.\r\nJohn Buford, who distinguished himself at Gettysburg, commanded the\r\nwater routes to the Northwest, and for more than 25 years was one of\r\nthe country's vital Army posts. The fort was garrisoned partly by\r\nex-Confederate soldiers, prisoners of war who had been paroled on oath\r\nthat they would not again bear arms against the Union and on agreement\r\nto enlist for service in the outposts of the West. It played an active\r\npart in the settlement of the Indian troubles, and in establishing the\r\nIndians upon the reservations.\r\n\r\nWhen Chief Joseph and his Nez Perce followers from Oregon finally\r\nsurrendered in the Bear Paw Mountains of Montana in 1877 after leading\r\ntheir pursuers a merry 2,000-mile chase through the Rockies for more\r\nthan a year, he was brought to Fort Buford before being placed on a\r\nreservation in Washington. Sitting Bull and his band of Sioux, after\r\ntheir flight into Canada in a vain attempt to avoid confinement on the\r\nreservation, also came to Fort Buford in 1881, and it was before the\r\nregimental headquarters building, the southernmost of the group now\r\nstanding, that the chief surrendered. Gall had preceded him by a few\r\nmonths, also coming to Fort Buford to give himself up.\r\n\r\nTelegraphic connections with Fort Lincoln were established in 1873, and\r\na wagon road, used until 1881, connected Fort Buford with the Custer\r\npost and with the railroad, which at that time ended in Bismarck. It\r\nfollowed the eastern side of the Missouri, and is still in use in some\r\nplaces (_see Side Tour 3B_). Except for goods sent by steamboat, all\r\nsupplies and mail were freighted over this road.\r\n\r\nFort Buford was sold at public auction in 1895. The 20-room residence\r\nof the commanding officers was purchased by John Mercer, who maintained\r\nit as a museum until its destruction by fire in 1937.\r\n\r\nSouth of the old buildings is FORT BUFORD STATE PARK, =9.5 m.=,\r\nincluding the military CEMETERY OF THE FORT. The unkept graves, some\r\nmarked with marble slabs, some with wooden markers on which the\r\ninscriptions have lost all legibility, are sunken and overgrown with\r\ngrass.\r\n\r\nAbout a quarter of a mile SE. of the buildings by the river, in the\r\n1830's and 1840's, stood a trading post known first as Fort William\r\nand later as Fort Mortimer. When William Sublette and Robert Campbell\r\nbuilt Fort William in 1833, they found themselves treated as intruders\r\nby the monopolistic American Fur Co. post at Fort Union. The policy\r\nof the American Fur Co., in its fight against competition, was to try\r\nevery kind of tactics, from rate wars to the instigation of killings\r\nby the Indians. On a typical occasion a band of Blackfeet Indians,\r\ncoming to trade, was met by a procession from Fort Union headed by a\r\nband in full uniform, with the traders following, bearing articles of\r\nbarter. That day the impressionable aborigines traded at Fort Union.\r\nAnother time a Fort William expedition to the Crow Indians was robbed\r\nof everything including horses by marauders believed to have been sent\r\nby the neighboring post.\r\n\r\nThe power of liquor as an article of trade was unbelievably great.\r\nCharles Larpenteur, who was at Fort William, tells in his memoirs of\r\ngoing into an Indian camp in weather so cold that his mules froze to\r\ndeath in the shelter provided for them, and obtaining 180 buffalo\r\nrobes for 5 gal. of alcohol, which sufficed to make everyone in the\r\ncamp drunk twice. The use of liquor was a sore point between Fort\r\nUnion and Fort William, for although it was illegal in Indian country\r\nSublette had been able to get a supply into Fort William, while every\r\nsimilar effort at Fort Union had been defeated. Larpenteur describes\r\nthe opening of trade at Fort William thus: \"The liquor trade started\r\nat dark, and soon the singing and yelling commenced. The Indians were\r\nall locked up in the fort, for fear that some might go to Fort Union,\r\nwhich was about two and one-half miles distant. Imagine the noise. Five\r\nhundred Indians with their squaws, all drunk as they could be, locked\r\nup in that small space.\" (The stockade was 150 ft. by 130 ft.) \"The\r\ndebauch continued during that entire night and well into the next\r\nday ... Indians in stupor from drink lay in every direction.\"\r\n\r\nCompetition grew keen. Beaver skins, which ordinarily were worth $3,\r\nbrought as much as $12. It was the policy of the American Fur Co.,\r\nhowever, to buy out its competitors if it could not frighten them out.\r\nAccordingly, after a year of bitter rivalry, an agreement was reached\r\nwhereby Sublette and Campbell sold Fort William to the Astor concern\r\nand moved W., leaving the profitable upper Missouri valley trade to\r\nFort Union.\r\n\r\nIn 1842 a new post, called Fort Mortimer, was built by Fox, Livingston\r\n& Co. a short distance back from the bank at the Fort William site. The\r\nnew traders did not long survive the competition of Fort Union, and in\r\n1846 found it expedient to sell out to the American Fur Co. Some 12\r\nyears later an adobe trading post was erected here, but little is known\r\nof it other than that it was abandoned in 1858 and was finally torn\r\ndown in 1866, its materials being used in the building of Fort Buford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOUR 7\r\n\r\n\r\n  Carrington--Minot--Bowbells--Portal--(Regina, Sask., Can.). US 52.\r\n\r\n  Carrington to Canadian border, 241.5 m.\r\n\r\n  Soo Ry. roughly parallels entire route.\r\n\r\n  Graveled roadbed except 38 m. bituminous-surfaced between Velva and\r\n  Foxholm.\r\n\r\n  Accommodations in principal towns.\r\n\r\nUS 52, pursuing a diagonal course northwest across the State, provides\r\na direct route between the Canadian Rockies and the Middle West. It\r\ntraverses a diversified farming area, and passes through the fertile\r\nSouris River valley and the treeless valley of the Des Lacs River. In\r\nthe green panorama of spring the prairie grasslands, dotted with small\r\ngrazing herds of white-faced Herefords or black and white Holsteins,\r\nalternate with tilled fields. By late summer tones of yellow dominate\r\nthe landscape, which after the harvest is left a scarred, grimy tan.\r\n\r\nAt CARRINGTON, =0.0 m.= (_see Tour 2_), is the junction with US 281\r\n(_see Tour 2_).\r\n\r\nAt =9 m.= on US 52 is the junction with ND 30, a graded dirt road.\r\n\r\nLeft on this road to the HAWKSNEST, =9 m.=, a high, flat-topped hill\r\nwith well-timbered slopes rising 400 ft. above the surrounding plain.\r\nNear its top is a crystal-clear spring. It was named in 1873 by a party\r\nof surveyors who saw a great number of hawks swarm from the trees. On\r\ntop of the hill is a large serpentine mound. After the coming of the\r\nwhite man the hill was a camping place for Sioux Indians traveling\r\nbetween Fort Totten and Fort Yates. They called the hill Huya Wayapa\r\nahdi (_where the eagle brings something home in his beak_). According\r\nto Indian legend a large band of Sioux once camped near the hill but\r\nwere unable to ascertain the whereabouts of a war party of Chippewa\r\nwhich they suspected to be near. One of the Sioux, however, observed\r\nthat an eagle flying into the trees carried in its mouth what appeared\r\nto be a piece of meat cut with a knife. From the direction in which the\r\neagle had flown the Sioux were able to find the enemy. The legend is\r\nsilent on the outcome of the warriors' meeting.\r\n\r\nLeft from the Hawksnest =3 m.= to CAMP KIMBALL HISTORIC SITE, where\r\nSibley camped July 22 and 23, 1863. It was from this point that the\r\nexpedition moved SW. to engage in the Battle of Big Mound (_see Tour\r\n8_).\r\n\r\nSYKESTON, =13 m.= (1,233 alt., 327 pop.), a German community named for\r\nRichard Sykes, who platted the town in 1883, is on the banks of the\r\nPIPESTEM RIVER and artificial LAKE HIAWATHA. Sykes Park provides good\r\ncamping. Buffalo favored this vicinity as a grazing spot before the\r\ncoming of settlers, but the semiannual hunting expeditions of the metis\r\n(_see Side Tour 5A_) destroyed many, and after the cattlemen arrived\r\nonly an occasional specimen was sighted. The library of an Inverness,\r\nScotland, home is adorned with the head of what was probably the last\r\nbuffalo killed in this vicinity. A party of guests at the Sykes ranch\r\nin 1881, including Ewen Grant of Inverness, learned that a buffalo was\r\ngrazing with the Sykes cattle, and in the exciting chase to bag the\r\nanimal Grant had the good fortune to despatch him.\r\n\r\nFESSENDEN, =36 m.= (1,610 alt., 738 pop.), named for Cortez Fessenden,\r\nsurveyor general of Dakota Territory from 1881 to 1885, was originally\r\nsettled by a group of Welsh farmers, though the population is now\r\npredominantly Scandinavian. Fessenden was platted in 1893, and in the\r\nelection of 1894 was named Wells County seat. Its citizens journeyed\r\nby teams and wagons in the still hours of the night to Sykeston,\r\nfirst county seat, seized the county records, and hauled them to the\r\nnew location. Each year (_March_) Fessenden holds an agricultural\r\nexposition culminating in the coronation of an Alfalfa Queen.\r\n\r\nHARVEY, =59.5 m.= (1,596 alt., 2,157 pop.), named for Col. James S.\r\nHarvey, a former director of the Soo Line, is on the banks of the\r\nSHEYENNE RIVER. It is a division point on the Soo, and is the largest\r\ntown on the route with the exception of Minot.\r\n\r\nRight from Harvey on ND 3, a graveled road, to junction with a dirt\r\nroad at =4 m.=; R. on this road to BUTTE DE MORALE, =7 m.=, an ancient\r\nlandmark rising 300 ft. above the surrounding prairie. It was to this\r\nvicinity that the metis, or French-Indian half-breeds, came in the\r\n1840's on their buffalo-hunting expeditions (_see Side Tour 5A_). It is\r\nsaid that on one occasion a party of 1,390 people with 824 wagons and\r\n1,200 animals camped here and slaughtered 250 buffalo in a single day.\r\nIn 1853 the surveying expedition of Gov. I. I. Stevens passed the hill,\r\nand in 1862-63 Capt. James L. Fisk led two expeditions of Montana gold\r\nseekers through the vicinity.\r\n\r\nMARTIN, =72.5 m.= (1,589 alt., 211 pop.), known in early days as\r\nCasselman, was later renamed for a Soo official in order to avoid\r\nconfusion with other towns of similar names. A group of Rumanians\r\nfrom Regina, Sask., settled here in 1893, but the population is\r\nnow predominantly German, as is that of ANAMOOSE (from Chippewa\r\n_uhnemoosh_, dog), =80.5 m.= (1,620 alt., 495 pop.).\r\n\r\nDRAKE, =89 m.= (1,634 alt., 644 pop.), named for an early settler,\r\nHerman Drake, is on the watershed between the Mouse and Sheyenne Rivers\r\nin a diversified farming and dairying area. A small railroad center,\r\nit has become a wholesale distribution point; a $20,000 cooperative\r\ncreamery is operated here.\r\n\r\nNorthwest of Drake the route traverses rolling tree-dotted hills that\r\nbegin to slope toward the Mouse River valley.\r\n\r\nBALFOUR, =97 m.= (1,613 alt., 197 pop.), named by the town site\r\ncompany, and VOLTAIRE, =116 m.= (1,587 alt., 61 pop.), believed to have\r\nbeen named for an early settler, are both young villages incorporated\r\nin 1929.\r\n\r\nThe road makes an abrupt descent into the flat, trough-like Mouse River\r\nvalley at VELVA, =122 m.= (1,511 alt., 870 pop.), which is at the\r\nsouthwestern point of the loop of the river, near a camp site of the\r\nSully expedition of 1865. The park-like little town is on the flood\r\nplain of the river which flows through it. First known as Mouse River\r\nPost Office, it was given its present name after organization of the\r\ntown site in 1891-92. A park in the northern part of the town offers\r\nrecreational facilities, and contains the FIRST DWELLING IN VELVA, a\r\nlog hut built in 1885.\r\n\r\n1. Right from Velva on a dirt road winding down the Mouse River\r\nvalley is VERENDRYE, =11 m.= (1,554 alt., 100 pop.). First known as\r\nFalsen, the town was given its present name in honor of Pierre de la\r\nVerendrye, earliest known white explorer in the region. Right from the\r\ntown pump =0.5 m.= to the globular masonry DAVID THOMPSON MEMORIAL,\r\nerected by the G. N. Ry. in 1925 on a high point overlooking the river\r\nvalley. On the base of the monument is the inscription: \"1770--David\r\nThompson--1885, Geographer and Astronomer passed near here in 1797 and\r\n1798 on a scientific and trading expedition. He made the first map of\r\nthe country which is now North Dakota and achieved many noteworthy\r\ndiscoveries in the northwest.\" Thompson made his explorations while an\r\nemployee of the North West Fur Co.\r\n\r\n2. Left from Velva on a graded dirt road to a junction with another\r\ngraded road at =4 m.=; R. here to another junction at =8 m.=; L. here\r\nto a STRIP MINE which is one of the larger lignite operating units\r\nin the United States, =10 m.= Here, in order to reach a vein of coal\r\naveraging 14 ft. in thickness, great shovels strip the 40-to 50-feet\r\noverburden and pile it into fantastic high mounds and ridges resembling\r\nthe work of a giant mole. Nearby is a small community of some 40 homes\r\nof miners.\r\n\r\nNorthwest of Velva the route follows the foot of the hills bordering\r\nthe valley to SAWYER, =128.5 m.= (1,525 alt., 206 pop.), believed to\r\nhave been named for a Soo Ry. official.\r\n\r\nMINOT, =144 m.= (1,557 alt., 16,099 pop.) (_see_ MINOT).\r\n\r\n  _Points of Interest_: Minot State Teachers College, Roosevelt Park\r\n  and Zoo.\r\n\r\nAt Valley St. and 4th Ave. SE. is a junction with US 2 (_see Tour 6_),\r\nwhich unites with US 52 to =150 m.= At 4th Ave. and 2nd St. SW. is the\r\njunction with US 83 (_see Tour 3_).\r\n\r\nLeft of the junction at =150 m.= is a large tourist camp.\r\n\r\nBURLINGTON, =152 m.= (1,590 alt., 150 pop.), named for Burlington,\r\nIowa, under the North Dakota Rural Rehabilitation Corporation became\r\nthe scene of the State's first SUBSISTENCE HOMESTEAD PROJECT. Here,\r\nin the wooded valley at the confluence of the Mouse and the Des Lacs\r\nRivers, a model village of comfortable homes arose (1937) to replace\r\nthe former dwellings of the miners who have part time employment in the\r\nlignite mines of the vicinity. When completed the project will provide\r\nhomes and irrigated garden-land for more than 50 families. The cost to\r\neach owner, including land, house, barn, garage, and chicken and hog\r\nhouses, will be approximately $3,500. A concrete dam and bowl spillway\r\non the Des Lacs River will irrigate more than half the 600 acres\r\nincluded in the project.\r\n\r\nA camp fire unwittingly built upon an outcropping of lignite at\r\nBurlington in the spring of 1883 is credited with first having\r\nacquainted pioneers here with the possibilities of developing the\r\nfuel on a large scale. Three men camped at the fork of the Mouse and\r\nDes Lacs Rivers were surprised one morning to find their camp fire\r\nof the previous night still burning. Upon investigation they learned\r\nthat their wood fire had ignited a blackish mineral--lignite--in the\r\nearth beneath it. All lignite mines in the Burlington vicinity are\r\nunderground (_open on application at mine office in Burlington_).\r\n\r\nNorthwest of Burlington the route follows the Des Lacs River valley to\r\nFOXHOLM, =163 m.= (1,657 alt., 200 pop.), named for Foxholm, England,\r\nand CARPIO, =171.5 m.= (1,696 alt., 344 pop.), which touches the hills\r\non both sides of the narrow valley. One story has it that Carpio was\r\nnamed by the wife of one of the railroad officials; another that the\r\nname was suggested by the fact that the first post office was a freight\r\ncar on which was posted the sign \"P. O.\"\r\n\r\nRight from Carpio on a graveled county road to the UPPER SOURIS\r\nMIGRATORY WATERFOWL PROJECT, =7 m.=, one of the largest of its type\r\nbeing undertaken in North Dakota by the U. S. Biological Survey. Here\r\na marshland along the Mouse River has been purchased and a large dam\r\nconstructed to impound a lake 26 m. long. A series of smaller dams\r\nfarther down the river will control the flood waters of the Souris and\r\nwill aid in restoring the marshes to suitable breeding and nesting\r\ngrounds for migratory waterfowl. The low, chalky white, red-roofed\r\nbuildings E. of the dam are PROJECT HEADQUARTERS.\r\n\r\nLeft from the dam on a gravel road to the CP RANCH, =14 m.=, which\r\nmaintains one of the few buffalo herds in the Northwest. Thirty-five\r\nshaggy-coated bison range in a 700-acre pasture, appearing at the ranch\r\nbuildings twice daily for water. A large herd of Hereford cattle is\r\nalso kept here.\r\n\r\nDONNYBROOK, =181 m.= (1,760 alt., 259 pop.), named by its founders for\r\nDonnybrook, Ireland, is at the foot of the hills bordering the western\r\nside of the Des Lacs valley.\r\n\r\nAt =189 m.= the route passes S. of DES LACS LAKE, a remnant of a\r\nglacial stream, now divided into three parts and drained by the Des\r\nLacs River. The U. S. Biological Survey has a large migratory waterfowl\r\nproject in progress on the lower lake, and as the road winds along the\r\neastern shore the nesting islands and several dams built by the survey\r\nare visible.\r\n\r\nKENMARE, =197 m.= (1,799 alt., 1,494 pop.), believed to have been named\r\nby the wife of a Canadian Pacific Ry. official for a community in\r\nIreland, lies on a hillside facing MIDDLE DES LACS LAKE. In the steep\r\nsides of the lake valley nearby are a number of lignite mines.\r\n\r\nOpposite Kenmare are the ADMINISTRATION BUILDINGS of the Des Lacs Lake\r\nMigratory Waterfowl Project--low white structures with red tile roofs.\r\n\r\nAt Kenmare the highway leaves the valley for the Drift Plain, which\r\nstretches away to the E. to meet the flat bed of glacial Lake Souris,\r\nbeyond which lie the Turtle Mountains. To the W. against the horizon\r\nrises the eastern edge of the great Missouri Plateau topped by the\r\nAltamont Moraine, the height of land between the Missouri and Souris\r\nRivers.\r\n\r\nAt =202 m.= is the Junction with ND 5, a graveled highway (_see Tour\r\n5_). US 52 and ND 5 are one route to =234 m.=\r\n\r\nAt =209 m.= the highway dips into a large cut to cross UPPER DES\r\nLACS LAKE, which, despite present dry conditions, was once the scene\r\nof steamboating. In early days it was navigable across the Canadian\r\nborder near Northgate, and grain from points in Canada and along the\r\nlake in North Dakota was shipped via the water route to Kenmare for\r\ntransshipment by rail to eastern markets. The years of continued\r\nsubnormal rainfall in this region have left the upper lake dry in\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nBOWBELLS, =214 m.= (1,961 alt., 695 pop.), named by English\r\nstockholders of the Soo Line for the famous Bow Bells in St.\r\nMary-le-Bow Church in London, is the Burke County seat. Almost\r\ntreeless, its squat appearance blends into the flat terrain, with the\r\ntall water tower, the only notable feature of the town, visible for\r\nmiles on the level prairie.\r\n\r\nFLAXTON, =226.5 m.= (1,940 alt., 423 pop.), was given its present name\r\nbecause the town site was a field of flax when application for a post\r\noffice was made.\r\n\r\nAt =234 m.= is a junction with ND 5 (_see Tour 5_).\r\n\r\nPORTAL, =241.5 m.= (1,954 alt., 512 pop.), is an important\r\ninternational port of entry, hence its name. It is an airport of\r\nentry, and also a division point on the Soo, much of the traffic to\r\nthe Canadian Northwest passing through its custom offices. The U. S.\r\nCUSTOM AND IMMIGRATION HOUSE (_for custom regulations see_ INFORMATION\r\nFOR TRAVELERS), on Boundary and Railway Aves., is a two-story brick\r\nbuilding in Colonial style. A large canopied driveway at the front\r\nof the building permits inspection of three automobiles at once. The\r\nCanadian custom offices are directly across the avenue, which is\r\nbisected by the international boundary. Portal is the home of many\r\nsports enthusiasts, and most of its games have an international aspect.\r\nUnusual in sports is the international golf course, on which in August\r\n1934 a young Portal golfer, George Wegener, made an international\r\nhole-in-one, driving from the eighth tee, which is in Canada, 125 yd.\r\ninto the cup on the ninth green, in the United States. The curling club\r\nhere is also international, being composed of both Canadian and United\r\nStates citizens in the border cities of Portal and North Portal. They\r\nplay this winter sport in a specially constructed domed building.\r\n\r\nUS 52 crosses the Canadian Line at the customhouses in the city of\r\nPortal, 30 m. S. of Estevan, Sask.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOUR 8\r\n\r\n\r\n  (Minneapolis, Minn.)--Fargo--Valley\r\n  City--Jamestown--Bismarck--Mandan--Dickinson--(Glendive, Mont.). US\r\n  10.\r\n\r\n  Minnesota Line to Montana Line, 368 m.\r\n\r\n  N. P. Ry. and Northwest Airlines parallel route across State.\r\n\r\n  Paved or bituminous-surfaced roadbed except 73 m. graveled.\r\n\r\n  Accommodations chiefly in towns.\r\n\r\nUS 10, rising steadily toward the foothills of the Rocky Mountains,\r\nwith a gain of 1,852 feet in altitude in crossing the State, traverses\r\nthe three main topographic divisions of North Dakota (_see_ NATURAL\r\nSETTING), from the low, flat Red River Valley, across the rolling Drift\r\nPlain and out upon the Missouri Plateau. Near the end of the route are\r\nthe strange and beautiful Badlands.\r\n\r\nMost of the country along the road is cultivated, and in the fields\r\nthe cycle of farming operations--plowing, seeding, cultivating,\r\nharvesting--repeats itself as the seasons progress. During the growing\r\nseason, stretching far across the flat plains and over the sloping\r\nhills, the varying greens of the grains blend with the blue flax fields\r\nand the invading yellow patches of mustard. In the fall the prairies\r\nhave a somber, peaceful air as their tawny stubblefields and newly\r\nplowed black acres await the first snowfall. When winter comes the\r\nnever-ending expanse of white is broken by the dark pattern of roads\r\nand an occasional lead-colored clump of trees, bare and shivering in\r\nthe wind, while at the distant horizon the whiteness unites with the\r\npale blue of clear winter skies.\r\n\r\nWest of the Red River Valley trees are few except along the rivers.\r\nYet, according to legend, this country was once heavily forested--until\r\nPaul Bunyan, the master woodsman, had his men log it off, just before\r\nhis famous fight with his foreman, the Bull of the Woods, on top of the\r\nbottom of the Mountain That Stood on Its Head. As a matter of geologic\r\nfact, the area traversed by the route has been largely treeless since\r\nthe gradual cooling of the climate, incident to the ice age, destroyed\r\nthe tropical plant and animal life which once were profuse here.\r\n\r\nFARGO, =0.0 m.= (907 alt., 28,619 pop.) (_see_ FARGO).\r\n\r\n  _Points of Interest_: North Dakota Agricultural College, Veterans'\r\n  Hospital, Dovre Ski Slide.\r\n\r\nAt Front and 13th Sts. is the junction with US 81 (_see Tour 1_).\r\n\r\nWEST FARGO (R) (907 alt., 127 pop.) and SOUTHWEST FARGO (L) (907 alt.,\r\n800 pop.), =5 m.=, suburbs of Fargo, are the center of North Dakota's\r\nmeat-packing industry. An ARMOUR & CO. PLANT (_open_; _tours at 9:30 &\r\n11 a.m., 1 & 3 p.m. Mon.-Fri., 10:30 a.m. only on Sat._; _no children\r\nunder 10_) and a large livestock market employ the majority of the\r\nresidents of these two young villages, incorporated in 1931 and 1937\r\nrespectively. Armour's plant, housed in a four-story brick building,\r\nemploys more than 400 people. Connected with it is the Union Stockyards\r\nwhere representatives of commission firms buy livestock from North\r\nDakota farmers. Included in the yards is an exchange building which\r\nhouses offices of the company, dealers, and commission firms, and State\r\nand Federal agencies supervising market operations.\r\n\r\nAt =12 m.= is the junction with a graveled county highway.\r\n\r\nRight on this highway is MAPLETON, =1 m.= (904 alt., 195 pop.), one\r\nof the oldest towns in the State, organized about 1870. It is named\r\nfor the MAPLE RIVER which flows through it, one of the many meandering\r\ntributaries of the Red.\r\n\r\nAt =20 m.= is the junction with ND 18, a graveled highway.\r\n\r\nRight on this road is CASSELTON, =2 m.= (936 alt., 1,254 pop.), named\r\nfor Maj. G. W. Cass (1810-1888) of Minneapolis, stockholder in the N.\r\nP. Ry. and proponent of the railroad nursery that propagated the poplar\r\ntrees that today line the streets. It was the boyhood home of William\r\nLanger (1886-), Governor of the State (1933-1934; 1937-1939) and a\r\nstorm center in Nonpartisan League politics (_see_ HISTORY).\r\n\r\nDuring the bonanza farm era (_see_ AGRICULTURE AND FARM LIFE)\r\nCasselton was headquarters of the huge Dalrymple farm, which made it\r\na metropolis of the Red River Valley. One of the earliest practical\r\nuses of the telephone in the United States, and what may have been the\r\nintroduction of the instrument into this State (_see Tour 1_), was made\r\nin 1876 on the Dalrymple farm. Oliver Dalrymple had taken advantage of\r\nlow prices occasioned by the panic of 1873 to buy 100,000 acres of Red\r\nRiver Valley land owned by the N. P. Ry. and had set out to demonstrate\r\nthat the land was valuable for farming. The first year he seeded 1,280\r\nacres and harvested 32,000 bu. of wheat. By 1878 he was farming 13,000\r\nacres and by 1895, 65,000 acres. His land was divided into subfarms,\r\neach with a superintendent and foreman, and all using the most modern\r\nfarm equipment obtainable. Dalrymple, on a visit to the Philadelphia\r\nCentennial in 1876, became interested in the newly invented telephone,\r\nand at the close of the fair purchased several of the instruments for\r\ninstallation on his subfarms and headquarters farm at Casselton.\r\n\r\nAmong the churches in Casselton is one maintained by a small group of\r\nMoravians, a German religious sect that came to the State during the\r\nearly years of settlement.\r\n\r\nOn ND 18 at =18 m.= to the D. H. HOUSTON FARM, where the principle of\r\nthe roll film camera was developed. Houston, a native of Wisconsin,\r\nhad already invented one camera when he homesteaded in North Dakota in\r\n1869. Although he acquired 6,000 acres of land and became one of the\r\nearly bonanza farmers, he continued his experiments in photography,\r\nand in 1881 developed the principle of the roll film camera, selling\r\nhis patent to George Eastman. It has been said that Houston named his\r\ndevice \"kodak\" for North Dakota, but the generally accepted story is\r\nthat Eastman himself coined the word because he desired a catchy,\r\neasily remembered name that could be used in any language. Houston's\r\ninventive interests included agricultural improvements, and in the\r\n1880's he developed an improved bluestem wheat which, producing four\r\nto five bushels more per acre than other varieties, was soon in great\r\ndemand throughout the Wheat Belt. He also patented improvements on the\r\ndisc plow.\r\n\r\nAt =26.5 m.= is the junction with a graveled road.\r\n\r\nRight on this road is WHEATLAND, =2 m.= (991 alt., 300 pop.), a quiet,\r\npretty village named for the vast wheat acreage formerly seeded on the\r\nbonanza farms in the area.\r\n\r\nAt =30.5 m.= the highway passes over a noticeable rise of land. This\r\nis Herman Beach, the western shore of ancient Lake Agassiz, which in\r\nglacial times covered 100,000 sq. m. and lay over the eastern portion\r\nof the State, reaching from Lake Winnipeg in Canada to Lake Traverse in\r\nSouth Dakota. It is estimated that when this gravelly ridge was formed\r\nby the waves of the lake, the water at the present site of Fargo was\r\n175 ft. deep.\r\n\r\nBUFFALO, =37.5 m.= (1,201 alt., 242 pop.), is named for Buffalo, N. Y.\r\n\r\nLeft from Buffalo on a graveled highway is ALICE, =11 m.= (1,124 alt.,\r\n169 pop.), named for a relative of a railroad superintendent.\r\n\r\nAt the Multz Cafe is a COLLECTION OF INDIAN ARTIFACTS (_open_).\r\n\r\nAt =40.5 m.= is BUFFALO CREEK HISTORIC SITE (R). A marker reads:\r\n\"August 16, 1863. General Sibley marched over this spot with 3,400\r\nsoldiers on his return after driving the Indians across the Missouri\r\nRiver.\"\r\n\r\nTOWER CITY, =43.5 m.= (1,169 alt., 435 pop.), in a grove of trees, is\r\nnamed for Charlemagne Tower (1848-1924), a Philadelphia capitalist and\r\ndiplomat, who owned much land in the vicinity. He made the foundation\r\nplantings of the trees of the city and also donated the first books\r\nto the local public library. In 1886 Baptist leaders selected this\r\ncity as the site of a proposed church college to be named Tower\r\nUniversity. Excavations had actually begun, with the expectation that\r\nTower would be its benefactor to the extent of $100,000. Because of\r\nsome misunderstanding of the preliminary arrangements, however, the\r\nendowment fund was not forthcoming. Tower offered the use of a school\r\nbuilding, but the school, being unable to continue without financial\r\nassistance, closed its doors two years later.\r\n\r\nAt =48.5 m.= is the junction with ND 32, a graveled highway.\r\n\r\nRight on this highway is ORISKA, =0.5 m.= (1,267 alt., 183 pop.), once\r\nthe center of a wide wheat-growing area. The name is believed to have\r\nbeen that of the heroine of an old book of western poems.\r\n\r\nAt =5 m.= on ND 32 to CAMP ARNOLD HISTORIC SITE, where in 1863 the\r\nSibley expedition made one of its many overnight camps.\r\n\r\nAt =56 m.= is the junction with a graveled road.\r\n\r\nLeft on this road to CAMP SHEARDOWN HISTORIC SITE, =3 m.,= another\r\nstopping place of the Sibley column. A few rifle pits dug for camp\r\nprotection are still visible, and a bronze tablet marks the site. No\r\nengagement took place here, the rifle pits being evidence of Sibley's\r\nprecautions against Indian attack.\r\n\r\nVALLEY CITY, =58.5 m.= (1,220 alt., 5,268 pop.), seat of Barnes County,\r\nlies sheltered and hidden in the deeply wooded Sheyenne River valley.\r\nOriginally known as Worthington, it was given its present name when\r\nincorporated as a city in 1881.\r\n\r\nThe city's first settlers came with the N. P. Ry. in 1872, but Jay\r\nCooke & Co., financiers of the railroad, crashed in the Nation-wide\r\npanic of 1873, and the next five years brought a suspension of\r\nbusiness and immigration. From 1878, however, the city had a steady\r\ngrowth; today it is the center of a large area of diversified farming,\r\nwith flour milling and the processing of dairy products the chief\r\nindustries. One notable asset of the city is a municipal light plant\r\nwhich supplies electrical energy at the lowest rates prevalent in\r\nthe State, and provides an excellent street-lighting system without\r\ntaxation. The studios and transmitter of KOVC, Valley City, are at 312\r\n5th Ave.\r\n\r\nOn an attractive campus at the southern end of 5th Ave. is the VALLEY\r\nCITY STATE TEACHERS COLLEGE, established in 1890. In 1895 Gov. Roger\r\nAllin vetoed the State appropriations for the university and colleges,\r\nand, like Other State educational institutions, the Valley City college\r\nwas kept open by popular subscriptions for the biennial period. One of\r\nthe outstanding alumni of the school is Paul Fjelde, a former student\r\nof Lorado Taft, who was commissioned to do the bust of Abraham Lincoln\r\nthat North Dakota presented to Norway in 1914. A copy of this work has\r\nbeen placed in the auditorium of the college.\r\n\r\nNear the college campus on 1st St. is CITY PARK, which contains\r\nrecreational facilities and a small zoo. CHAUTAUQUA PARK (_swimming\r\npool_, _playgrounds_, _large auditorium_) is in the northeastern part\r\nof the city.\r\n\r\nIn the BARNES COUNTY COURTHOUSE, 6th St. bet. 3rd and 4th Aves., is\r\na small museum which includes the Indian collection of Vernon Gale,\r\nan amateur archeologist. Among his exhibits are several stone hearts,\r\nwhich have been found only in the valley of Spiritwood Lake (=see\r\nbelow=).\r\n\r\nThe N. P. Ry. HIGH BRIDGE, known as the \"Hi-Line\", casts its long\r\nshadow across the river valley N. of Chautauqua Park. Including the\r\napproaches, it measures 1 m., a long railroad trestle for its height,\r\nwhich is 148 ft. above the water level of the Sheyenne.\r\n\r\nRight from Valley City on Chautauqua Blvd., which becomes a graveled\r\nroad leading to a spot still known as ASHTABULA, =17 m.=, the name of a\r\npost office once operated here. A ford in the Sheyenne at this point,\r\nSibley's Crossing, was used by Capt. James Fisk's immigrant trains\r\nto the Montana gold fields in 1862 and 1863, and twice by the Sibley\r\nmilitary expedition in 1863, and later was on the Fort Ransom-Fort\r\nTotten trail. Deep ruts of wagon trains are still visible and can be\r\ntraced across the valley.\r\n\r\nAt Valley City is a junction (L) with ND 1, a graveled highway (_see\r\nSide Tour 8A_), which unites with US 10 to =63.5 m.=, where ND 1 (_see\r\nSide Tour 8B_) branches R.\r\n\r\nOn US 10 at the western end of the city is PIONEER PARK (R), where an\r\noutdoor amphitheater has been built. The park also contains a small\r\nframe schoolhouse, typical of the pioneer period, which was moved from\r\nits site four miles west of the city.\r\n\r\nSANBORN, =70.5 m.= (1,443 alt., 343 pop.), named for J. N. Sanborn,\r\na Fargo pioneer, was at one time a booming trade center, and seemed\r\ndestined to become important, until two severe blows retarded its\r\ngrowth. First, in 1880, after a hot campaign, it lost the county seat\r\nelection to Valley City; and then, in 1882, the county treasurer, whose\r\nbond had been furnished by the businessmen of the town, absconded\r\nwith the county moneys, including a special fund for the erection of\r\na courthouse. Among the early settlers of Sanborn was I. W. Barnum,\r\nbrother of P. T. Barnum of circus fame.\r\n\r\nECKELSON, =75.5 m.= (1,472 alt., 100 pop.), was named for A. O.\r\nEckelson, a N. P. Ry. civil engineer of the 1870's, and was first\r\nplatted a mile E. of its present site. Because of the steep incline of\r\nthe railroad at that point, however, trains were unable to stop and the\r\ntown had to be moved to more level ground.\r\n\r\nSPIRITWOOD, =82.5 m.= (1,475 alt., 267 pop.), is named for the lake 16\r\nm. NW.\r\n\r\nAt =93.5 m.= is the junction with ND 20, a graveled highway.\r\n\r\nRight on this highway to the junction with a county graveled road,\r\n=10 m.=; R. here to SPIRITWOOD LAKE (_bathing beaches_, _boathouses_,\r\n_cottages_, _golf course_, _and two pavilions on the southern shore_),\r\n16 m., an attractive resort in a wooded valley. It is known to the\r\nSioux as Minneskaya (_water with white foam on top_). According to an\r\nIndian legend, a grief-stricken girl plunged into its waters to join\r\nher drowned lover, and her spirit still resides in the lake.\r\n\r\nOn the northern shore of the lake the State Game and Fish Commission\r\nmaintains an AVIARY where Mongolian pheasants are confined for breeding\r\npurposes. Eggs are hatched on nearby farms and the poults are then\r\nreturned to the aviary for distribution throughout the State.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of Spiritwood Lake have been found several heart-shaped\r\nstones marked with a small cross, probably representing a star. This\r\nis the only locality in the State where these stone hearts have been\r\nfound, and archeologists believe they are the product of the early\r\nIndians. Specimens are on display at the State historical society\r\nmuseum (_see_ BISMARCK) and in the Vernon Gale Collection (_see_ VALLEY\r\nCITY _above_).\r\n\r\nJAMESTOWN, =95.5 m.= (1,405 alt., 8,187 pop.), Stutsman County seat,\r\nlies in the fertile valley of the winding JAMES RIVER, described as\r\nthe longest unnavigable river in the world. The story is told that\r\nthe stream received its name from a French-Indian hunter-trapper who,\r\nhaving lost his way, was overcome with joy upon discovering the little\r\nriver and gave it his own name--Rivière de Jacques.\r\n\r\nThe first settlement at Jamestown was made in the fall of 1871, when a\r\ncorps of five or six N. P. Ry. engineers spent the winter here in order\r\nto be in readiness for work in the spring. Soldiers from Fort Ransom\r\n(_see Side Tour 8A_) acted as a guard for the engineers, and in June a\r\nmilitary post, Fort Cross (later Fort Seward), was established. During\r\nthe summer settlers and businessmen came to the community, and a brisk\r\ntrade was carried on with the 500 railroad workers and the 3 companies\r\nof soldiers stationed at the fort.\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 13, 1872, the first train to enter Jamestown crossed the river\r\ninto the city. Less than a month later construction crews, incensed\r\nbecause of unpaid wages, stopped work, and even began tearing up\r\nthe newly laid tracks. Soldiers from the fort quickly quelled North\r\nDakota's first strike.\r\n\r\nRailroads played an important role in Jamestown's inception and growth.\r\nAt one time there were prospects that two other railroads besides the\r\nN. P. would come into the city, and hope was high that the place would\r\nbecome an important railroad center. Although these plans did not fully\r\nmaterialize, one of the new roads, the Midland Continental, did make\r\nthe city its home office. Financed by English capital, the Midland\r\nbegan to build in 1913, with plans for a line connecting Winnipeg,\r\nMan., with the Gulf of Mexico. The World War intervened, foreign\r\nsupport was withdrawn, and operations ceased after completion of only\r\n70 m. of road, from Edgeley to Wimbledon.\r\n\r\nThe first church services here were held in a schoolhouse, and a\r\npioneer tells of how these meetings were faithfully attended by an old\r\nIndian \"clad in great dignity and an old nightshirt.\" Jamestown's first\r\nchurch, the Presbyterian, was erected in 1881. The first resident Roman\r\nCatholic priest arrived the same year, and resided in a rectory that\r\nmeasured 14 x 22 ft. Although there were many places in the State where\r\nCatholic church services had long been held, Jamestown in September\r\n1889 became the first seat of the diocese of North Dakota.\r\n\r\nIn 1879 a group of local businessmen organized the James River\r\nNavigation Co. Of their first steamer, the _Belle of Richmond_, the St.\r\nPaul _Pioneer Press_ said, \"The craft is composed of a steam-whistle,\r\nan engine the size of a teakettle and a little boat under it.\" Ice put\r\na stop to river navigation that fall, and in May the following year the\r\ninitial trip of a new boat that had been built during the winter proved\r\nunsuccessful.\r\n\r\nThe fertile James River Valley land has produced such bountiful crops\r\nthat between 1875 and 1900 farmers often paid for their lands in two\r\nyears. A writer of that time says that \"though North Dakota didn't have\r\ngranite bluffs and waterfalls for its beauty, a land that would yield\r\ntwice its cost in the first year would look rather beautiful to most\r\nmen.\"\r\n\r\nMaxwell Anderson (1888-), Pulitzer Prize playwright (1933), and Curtis\r\nD. Wilbur (1867-), Secretary of War in President Coolidge's cabinet,\r\nonce attended school in Jamestown.\r\n\r\nThe two leading institutions of Jamestown overlook the city from the\r\nriver bluffs on both sides of town. To the SE. is the STATE HOSPITAL\r\nFOR THE INSANE, with its handsome buildings and beautifully landscaped\r\ngrounds, a little city within its 2,000 acres of farm land.\r\n\r\nJAMESTOWN COLLEGE, on high bluffs (L) on the northeastern edge of\r\nthe city, is the oldest, and only private, college in North Dakota.\r\nFounded by the Red River Presbytery in 1883, it was the first school\r\nin the State to offer normal school training for teachers. A plan for\r\nconstruction in semi-Gothic style has been followed, with the result\r\nthat the buildings present a pleasing and uniform campus group.\r\n\r\nOn the campus is Voorhees Chapel, one of the finest college chapels in\r\nthe Midwest; it is built of reinforced concrete, Bedford stone, and\r\nmat-faced Menominee brick. The interior is constructed with huge hammer\r\nbeams of Gothic type, and there are two high Gothic windows. The chapel\r\nis also used for musical and dramatic performances, as the intent of\r\nthe institution is to make this building the center of college life and\r\nassociations.\r\n\r\nKLAUS PARK, at the southwestern edge of the city, with entrances on\r\nElder and Willow Aves., consists of 26 acres of heavily wooded land\r\nlying between the James River and Pipestem Creek. It was donated to\r\nthe city by the heirs of Anton Klaus, prominent pioneer affectionately\r\nknown as \"the father of Jamestown.\" An outdoor swimming pool is\r\nsupplied with warm artesian water. Preserved in the park is one of the\r\noriginal millstones used in Jamestown's first flour mill built by Anton\r\nKlaus in 1879.\r\n\r\nNICKEUS PARK (_equipped playgrounds_), at the northern end of 5th\r\nAve., is in a loop of the James River. It was donated to the city as a\r\nmemorial to a pioneer Jamestown attorney, by Mrs. Fannie B. Nickeus,\r\nhis widow.\r\n\r\nCITY PARK (_municipal tourist camp_, _ball park_, _fairgrounds_, _and\r\ntennis courts_), at the southern end of 4th Ave., consists of a 52-acre\r\ntract along the wooded James River. The Park Auditorium, completed in\r\n1936 as a WPA project, is a domical building, the design of its facade\r\ncarried out in the straight lines and angles of modern architecture.\r\nConstructed with laminated truss-type arches which support the\r\nentire roof load, the auditorium has 25,000 sq. ft. of floor space\r\nunobstructed by supporting columns. Its acoustics is excellent, owing\r\nto the vaulted shape of the roof and the absorbing quality of the\r\ntimbers in the arches.\r\n\r\nKRMC, Jamestown's radio broadcasting station, has its studios in the\r\nGladstone Hotel building at 412 Front St. W.; its transmitter is just\r\nacross the James River S. of the city.\r\n\r\nThe ALFRED DICKEY LIBRARY, corner 5th Ave. S. and Pacific St. W.,\r\nis built of red Hebron (N. Dak.) brick. Its style shows a Byzantine\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nThe SITE OF FORT WILLIAM H. SEWARD is indicated by a marker on US 281\r\nat the foot of the bluffs on the northwestern outskirts of the city.\r\nThe post, named for President Lincoln's Secretary of State, was\r\nabandoned in 1877, and in 1925 the N. P. Ry. donated the site, which is\r\non the bluffs SW. of the marker, as a State park.\r\n\r\nLeft from Jamestown =2 m.= on Monroe St. to HOMER STATE PARK, a\r\nfive-acre tract along the James River that was the site of an\r\nunidentified skirmish between white men and Indians.\r\n\r\nELDRIDGE, =103.5 m.= (1,538 alt., 100 pop.), named for a pioneer\r\nfamily, is the most westerly town on the route lying within the\r\nCentral Lowland of the Interior Plains. Between Eldridge and WINDSOR,\r\n=112.5 m.= (1,839 alt., 110 pop.), whose name was suggested by that of\r\nWindsor, Ont., there is a rise of 300 ft., which marks the division\r\nbetween the Central Lowland and the Great Plains. The Missouri Plateau,\r\nas this section of the Great Plains is called, extends beyond the\r\nwestern border of the State. As the route continues into the plateau,\r\nthe altitude rises slightly to the village of CLEVELAND, =116 m.=\r\n(1,849 alt., 273 pop.),--named for Cleveland, Ohio--only to fall away\r\ngradually and then rise once more in topping the Altamont Moraine (_see\r\nbelow_.)\r\n\r\nMEDINA, =124 m.= (1,791 alt., 407 pop.), named for Medina, N. Y., has\r\na strongly Russo-German population. It was originally known as Midway\r\nfor its position halfway between Jamestown and Steele, and during the\r\nfirst two decades of the century was an important commercial point in\r\nthe area.\r\n\r\nAt =126 m.= is the junction with ND 30, a graveled highway.\r\n\r\nLeft on this highway to the junction with a graded dirt road, =12\r\nm.=; R. here to the junction with another dirt road, =17 m.=; R. to\r\nanother junction, =18 m.=; and L. to Lake George, commonly known as\r\nSALT LAKE (_swimming_), 19 m., because of its heavy impregnation with\r\nnatural salts. It is said to be one of the deepest lakes in the State.\r\nThe southern shore has an excellent sand beach. Northeast of the lake\r\nare fresh-water springs; here, on land controlled by the Biological\r\nSurvey through an easement, dikes and dams have been built to create\r\na fresh-water feeding and nesting ground known as the LAKE GEORGE\r\nMIGRATORY WATERFOWL PROJECT. On the southern shore is STREETER MEMORIAL\r\nPARK, a World War memorial.\r\n\r\nAt =132 m.= are CRYSTAL SPRINGS LAKES. A cairn (L) houses a spring\r\n(_good water_). The lake offers fine opportunity to study varieties of\r\nshore birds, as the marshes of the spring-fed waters provide attractive\r\nbreeding places. CRYSTAL SPRINGS, =132.5 m.= (1,777 alt., 69 pop.), is\r\nnamed for the neighboring lakes.\r\n\r\nWest of Cleveland (_see above_) the route descends in a gentle grade to\r\nTAPPEN, =140.5 m.= (1,764 alt., 268 pop.), named for an early settler.\r\n\r\nRight from Tappen on a country trail, unsuited for trailers, to\r\nMcPHAIL'S BUTTE HISTORIC SITE, =10 m.= It was from this hill that Col.\r\nSamuel McPhail directed the movement of his regiment of Minnesota\r\nRangers July 24, 1863, in the Battle of Big Mound, one of the Sibley\r\nexpedition encounters with the Sioux. After having been harried by\r\nthe white soldiers, a small group of Sioux had asked to talk with a\r\ndelegation of the enemy, and the meeting was apparently proceeding in\r\nan amicable manner when without warning a young Indian shot Dr. J. S.\r\nWeiser, one of the party, in the back. The Battle of Big Mound was\r\nprecipitated, and the Sioux were forced to retreat farther W. Northeast\r\nof the battle site is BURMAN HISTORIC SITE, =2 m.=, where Dr. Weiser is\r\nburied.\r\n\r\nDAWSON, =146 m.= (1,736 alt., 306 pop.), named for the town site\r\nowner, Dawson Thompson, is in a fertile subirrigated area. A route for\r\nmigratory birds crossing the United States passes through the Dawson\r\nvicinity, and a U. S. game reserve is 7 m. S. of the town on ND 3. At\r\nDawson is one of the six Department of Commerce intermediate lighted\r\nairports in the State.\r\n\r\nLeft from Dawson on ND 3, a graveled highway, to LAKE ISABEL, =5 m.=\r\nHere is CAMP GRASSICK, a children's summer camp operated by the North\r\nDakota Anti-Tuberculosis Association. It is named for Dr. J. Grassick,\r\npioneer Grand Forks physician. Just E. of Lake Isabel are the LODGE\r\nAND GAME RESERVE OF G. L. SLADE (_private_). Slade, a son-in-law of\r\nthe late James J. Hill, the railroad builder, maintains breeding and\r\nnesting grounds for pheasants and waterfowl--even creating his own Lake\r\nSlade by pumping water from deep wells--and brings large parties of\r\nEasterners here to hunt.\r\n\r\nAt =25 m.= is NAPOLEON (1,955 alt., 709 pop.), seat of Logan County,\r\nnamed for Napoleon Goodsill who was president of the town site company.\r\nThe first business establishment (1886) was a supply store operated\r\njointly with a newspaper, the Napoleon _Homestead_, which is still in\r\noperation. Two pigeon-holes in a desk in the _Homestead_ office served\r\nas boxes for the first post office in Napoleon.\r\n\r\nBURNSTAD, =40.5 m.= (1,963 alt., 142 pop.), was formerly the trade\r\ncenter of a large cattle industry. C. P. Burnstad, for whom the town\r\nwas named, was known as the \"Logan County Cattle King\", and grazed as\r\nmany as 5,000 cattle on 54 sections of land.\r\n\r\nLeft from Burnstad =2 m.= on a graded dirt road to BEAVER LAKE STATE\r\nPARK (_swimming_, _picnicking_), a recreational area developed by WPA\r\nlabor. A game refuge surrounds the lake.\r\n\r\nAt =53.5 m.= on ND 3 is WISHEK (2,010 alt., 1,145 pop.), where, as in\r\nmany of the neighboring towns, Russo-Germans make up the greater part\r\nof the population. The town is named for J. H. Wishek of Ashley, who\r\nowned the town site and donated lots for churches, parks, the town\r\nhall, and a bandstand.\r\n\r\nLeft from Wishek =6.5 m.= on a graveled road to DOYLE MEMORIAL PARK on\r\nGREEN LAKE (_swimming_, _picnicking_). The land for this recreational\r\narea and memorial to pioneers was given to the State by Mr. and Mrs.\r\nJohn J. Doyle of Wishek.\r\n\r\nAt =65 m.= on ND 3 is DANZIG (2,029 alt., 86 pop.), named for the Free\r\nCity of Danzig in Europe.\r\n\r\nASHLEY, =77.5 m.= (2,001 alt., 1,250 pop.), began as the town of\r\nHoskins on the shore of nearby Hoskins Lake. Originally the town, as\r\nwell as the lake was given the maiden name of the wife of Col. C.\r\nA. Lounsberry, historian, and at that time editor of the Bismarck\r\n_Tribune_. In 1888, to be on the railroad, Hoskins was moved bodily to\r\nthe present site and was renamed in honor of Ashley E. Morrow, a member\r\nof the railroad construction company. In the rotunda of the MCINTOSH\r\nCOUNTY COURTHOUSE is a series of pictures of pioneer life. A library\r\nfounded in 1912 by the Ashley Women's Club is also in the courthouse.\r\n\r\nRight from Ashley =4 m.= on ND 11, a graveled highway, to LAKE HOSKINS\r\n(_swimming_), a summer recreational center.\r\n\r\nOn ND 3 at =85 m.= is the South Dakota Line, 84 m. N. of Aberdeen, S.\r\nDak.\r\n\r\nSTEELE, =154.5 m.= (1,855 alt., 519 pop.), granted a city charter by\r\nthe Territorial legislature in 1882-83, claimed at the time of its\r\nincorporation to be the smallest city in the United States. It is named\r\nfor Col. W. P. Steele, one of the original town site owners, who in\r\n1889 sent the first legislature a certified check for $100,000 with\r\nhis bid for locating the State capitol at Steele. Colonel Steele liked\r\nriding on railroad trains and meeting strangers to whom he could talk\r\nof the glowing possibilities of North Dakota. At one time he procured\r\npasses on many of the large railroads in exchange for passes on his\r\nown road, the Steele-Alaska Northwestern, which despite its impressive\r\ntitle was only a half-mile spur from the Northern Pacific to his brick\r\nplant NE. of Steele. When his hoax was discovered and he was hailed\r\nbefore a group of directors of the larger lines, he justified his\r\nposition with the statement, \"While my line is not as long as yours, I\r\nwant it understood that it is every bit as wide.\"\r\n\r\nLeft from Steele on a graveled road to the junction with a dirt road,\r\n=12 m.=; R. on this road to PURSIAN LAKE (_swimming_, _picnicking_),\r\n_15 m._, a haven for migratory waterfowl.\r\n\r\nDRISCOLL (L), =165.5 m.= (1,870 alt., 226 pop.), is named for a N. P.\r\nRy. stockholder.\r\n\r\nRight from Driscoll on a road unsuitable for trailers to the junction\r\nwith a country trail, =3 m.=; R. here to CHASKA HISTORIC SITE, =4 m.=,\r\nthe grave of Chaska, a Sioux Indian scout with the Sibley expedition,\r\nwho died during the campaign. Chaska is said to have been one of the\r\ntwo friendly Indians who warned the missionaries at the Yellow Medicine\r\n(Minn.) Agency and led the whites to safety from the vengeful Sioux in\r\nthe uprising of 1862.\r\n\r\nWest of Driscoll the route begins the ascent of the ALTAMONT MORAINE,\r\nthe terminal moraine formed during the last advance of the Dakota lobe\r\nof the great continental ice sheets.\r\n\r\nAt =174 m.= is the junction with US 83 (_see Tour 3_). The two highways\r\nform one route between this point and Bismarck, _198.5 m._ Just W. of\r\nthe junction the highway passes over a crest of the moraine, from which\r\non a clear day the distant outline of the 19-story State capitol is\r\nvisible, 24 m. W. The highway descends the western slope of the moraine\r\nin a gradual incline toward the Missouri River valley.\r\n\r\nMcKENZIE, =180 m.= (1,700 alt., 175 pop.), is named for Alexander\r\nMcKenzie, early day political boss in North Dakota.\r\n\r\nAt =185.3 m.= is the junction with a dirt road.\r\n\r\nRight on this road to VERENDRYE, STATE PARK, =1 m.=, believed by many\r\nhistorians to be the point at which in 1738 Pierre de la Verendrye,\r\nearliest white explorer of present North Dakota, first visited the\r\nMandan Indians. Prior to the investigation of this site in 1936\r\nit was generally supposed that Verendrye's first contact with the\r\nMandans had been made near Sanish, and a monument commemorating the\r\nmeeting had been erected at that place (_see Tour 6_). The Menoken\r\nsite shows clearly the position of the bastions and moat of the old\r\nfortifications, and saucer-shaped depressions indicate where the\r\nearth lodges once stood. In addition, pottery, flint chips, and other\r\nartifacts have been found. Verendrye's journal states that he presented\r\na leaden plate, bearing the name of the exploring party, to the Mandan\r\nchief at the village he visited. A similar plate was given to the\r\nIndians by Verendrye's sons on an expedition farther S. in 1741, and\r\nwas found buried in the earth near Fort Pierre, S. Dak. in 1913. The\r\nfirst plate, however, has not been recovered and may now lie buried\r\nsomewhere in the Menoken site.\r\n\r\nMENOKEN, =185.5 m.= (1,720 alt., 60 pop.), has had a number of names,\r\nand still retains two officially. In early railroad days it was known\r\nas Seventeenth Siding, and later as Blaine. For transportation purposes\r\nit is now called Burleigh, to distinguish it from several other towns\r\non the N. P. Ry. which have names beginning with _M_.\r\n\r\nAt =186 m.= is the junction with a county graded dirt road.\r\n\r\nRight on this road to the TRANSMITTING PLANT OF KFYR, =2.5 m.=,\r\nBismarck's broadcasting station. The 704-foot all-steel vertical\r\nradiator, one of the three tallest self-supporting aerials in the\r\nUnited States (1938), can be seen for many miles.\r\n\r\nBetween Menoken and Bismarck the route crosses and recrosses APPLE\r\nCREEK, along which Sibley's army traveled for some distance. In ancient\r\ntimes this small, meandering stream was a great rushing glacial river.\r\n\r\nAt =196.5 m.= (R) loom the brick walls of the STATE PENITENTIARY\r\n(_tours daily exc. Sat. and Sun. at 9, 10, and 11 a.m., 2, 3, and\r\n4 p.m._). When the prison was built (1885-89), the walls were of\r\ncottonwood logs wired together at the top. The present walls, 27 ft.\r\nhigh and 1,650 ft. long, and made of bricks from clay found in the\r\nvicinity, were constructed by prison labor in 1889. The island-type of\r\nprison architecture has been employed, and there are two cell blocks of\r\n160 cells each, all locked by a master control. Inmates are employed in\r\nthe twine plant, which has an annual output of more than four million\r\npounds; on the 950-acre farm; and in the auto license and tag plant.\r\n\r\nThe fact that most criminals come from large centers of population is\r\ngiven as the reason that North Dakota, an agricultural State with no\r\nlarge cities, has a low prison population. In 1937 it was only 270.\r\n\r\nAt =197 m.= is the junction with a graveled road.\r\n\r\nLeft on this road to FORT LINCOLN, =3 m.=, only survivor of the 12\r\nmilitary posts that have been established in North Dakota since\r\nearliest settlement. The post, which covers an area of 900 acres, has\r\nbrick buildings of modified Colonial design. It was first occupied in\r\n1903, although established as a military reservation in 1895. In 1913\r\nits garrison was removed, but in 1917 it was used as a concentration\r\ncamp for midwestern troops headed for France. After the World War\r\nit was not garrisoned until 1927, when Companies I, K, L, and M of\r\nthe Third Battalion, Fourth Infantry were ordered here. Including\r\ndetachments of Headquarters, Quartermasters and Service Corps, Medical\r\nCorps, and Signal and Finance Corps, the post numbers 426 enlisted men\r\nand 20 officers (1937). Since 1928 it has been designated a C. M. T. C.\r\ncamp for a four-week period each summer, with a quota of 200 men.\r\n\r\nAt =4 m.= is a junction with a dirt road; R. here to another junction,\r\n=4.8 m.=; L. to SIBLEY ISLAND PARK (_shelters_, _tables_, _and\r\nbenches_), =7 m.= Sibley Island was actually an island when General\r\nSibley fought the Sioux here in 1863, but now, because of the changing\r\nriver channel, is a part of the river lowlands. The Indians, fleeing\r\nbefore the advancing column, were here forced to abandon large\r\nquantities of supplies and equipment, and to hurry across the Missouri.\r\nTwo Sibley men, carrying orders to detachments in the woods, were\r\nambushed and killed, and the Masonic burial given one is believed to\r\nhave been the first instance of the use of this funeral rite within the\r\nborders of the State. The bodies were removed later, but the position\r\nof one grave is still indicated by a marker. Prior to the Sibley\r\nencounter the island was known as Assiniboine Island, from the fact\r\nthat the _Assiniboine_, a river steamer carrying Prince Maximilian's\r\nexploring party, was destroyed by fire near here (1834).\r\n\r\nBISMARCK, =198.5 m.= (1,672 alt., 11,090 pop.) (_see_ BISMARCK).\r\n\r\n  _Points of Interest_: State Capitol, Liberty Memorial Building,\r\n  Roosevelt Cabin, State historical society museum.\r\n\r\nAt Main Ave. and 6th St. is the junction with US 83 (_see Tour 3_).\r\n\r\nAt =199.5 m.= US 10 crosses the MISSOURI RIVER on the $1,358,000\r\nLIBERTY MEMORIAL BRIDGE, erected in 1922, first highway span across the\r\nriver in North Dakota. At each end are large natural boulders bearing\r\nbronze plaques dedicating the bridge to men and women who served in the\r\nWorld War.\r\n\r\nNatural gas from the fields at Baker, Mont., is piped to Bismarck\r\nthrough a line crossing the Missouri on this bridge.\r\n\r\nAt the Bismarck end of the bridge is the junction with a county\r\ngraveled highway (_see Side Tour 3B_).\r\n\r\nThoroughfare of early exploration of western North Dakota and Montana,\r\nthe Missouri is still known to the Sioux Indians native to this region\r\nas Wakpa Hehanka (_elk river_). According to Sioux legend, once, during\r\nthe great spring break-up, a large herd of elk were crossing the stream\r\nwhen the ice broke beneath them, precipitating them into quicksand.\r\nThey perished, and when the ice had floated down the river the antlers\r\nof the elk were left protruding like branches from the sand bar.\r\n\r\nThe time changes from central to mountain standard W. of the river;\r\nwatches and clocks of west-bound travelers should be turned back one\r\nhour, those of east-bound travelers should be set an hour ahead.\r\n\r\nAlong the highway on the flat lowlands between Bismarck and Mandan are\r\nseveral tourist camps and night clubs.\r\n\r\nMANDAN, =203.4 m.= (1,642 alt., 5,037 pop.), its business section\r\nstretched along one side of its long main street, lies crowded between\r\nthe N. P. railroad yards and the hills bordering the Heart River valley\r\nnear the confluence of the Heart and the Missouri.\r\n\r\nNamed for the agricultural Mandan Indian tribe, this western, overgrown\r\nsmall town is in the area they once occupied, and near two of their\r\nancient village sites. One, Crying Hill Village, is on the bluffs along\r\nthe Missouri, NE. of the city; the other, known as the Motsiff Site,\r\n2 m. S. on the banks of the Heart. The town itself is so young that\r\nmany of the original false-front frame or ornate red-brick buildings\r\nare still standing. A village grew up here quickly when the railroad\r\ncrossed the Missouri in 1881, and incorporation as a city followed in\r\n1883. With the settling of the adjoining territory, which began within\r\ntwo years after the founding of the town, development was rapid. Early\r\nranching in the region has given way to grain raising, dairying, and\r\ndiversified dry farming, and the city has become a wholesale and retail\r\ndistribution center serving a large agricultural area.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief economic supports of the city is the N. P. Ry., which\r\nmaintains a division point here. The RAILWAY DEPOT is a red brick\r\ncopy of Washington's Mount Vernon home, and the flagpole in the park\r\nsurrounding it was used at Fort Abraham Lincoln when Gen. George A.\r\nCuster was in command (_see_ FORT LINCOLN STATE PARK). In the railroad\r\npark, in an ellipse formed by the driveway, stands a small bronze\r\nSTATUE OF THEODORE ROOSEVELT as a Rough Rider, a reproduction of a\r\nlarge monument in a Minot park (_see_ MINOT). On the depot platform,\r\nduring the summer months, Yanktonai Sioux perform bits of native dances\r\nfor the benefit of tourists on the fast trains. On this platform Nov.\r\n1, 1926, Queen Marie of Rumania, making a transcontinental tour, was\r\nadopted by the Sioux.\r\n\r\nThe RAILROAD YARDS are unusual in that their accommodations facilitate\r\nhandling and housing of the large Pacific type locomotives known as\r\nFive Thousands, so called because they are numbered above 5,000.\r\nBecause of their great length, 125 ft., and their weight, 550 tons,\r\nthey cannot be used on the sharp curves of the Rocky Mountains; they\r\nare therefore employed exclusively on the steep Mandan-Billings,\r\nMont., run. Five Thousands are used only for heavy freight traffic.\r\nThe largest turntable on the N. P. system, 126 ft. long, handles these\r\ngiants of the rails.\r\n\r\nAt 1st St. and 2nd Ave. NW. is the MEMORIAL BUILDING, which has the\r\nlargest indoor swimming pool in the State. The building was constructed\r\nunder a Federal project.\r\n\r\nThe J. D. ALLEN TAXIDERMIST SHOP, 302 5th Ave. NW., contains a rare\r\ncollection of Indian relics, original paintings, and a variety of\r\nmounted specimens of animals, birds, and fish found in the State. In\r\nthe hodgepodge of his workshop, Allen, who came to Mandan as a youth\r\nin 1881, has mounted thousands of specimens, and has done work for\r\nTheodore Roosevelt and for members of European nobility. His hobby\r\nhas been painting, and, although self-taught in his avocation, he has\r\ncaptured the spirit of early North Dakota scenes as have few trained\r\nartists. Several of his canvases hang in the museum of the State\r\nhistorical society (_see_ BISMARCK).\r\n\r\nKGCU, with studios and transmitter in the Kennelly building, is at 205\r\n1st St. NW.\r\n\r\nCHAUTAUQUA PARK (_picnic grounds_, _tourist camp_, _golf course_,\r\n_clubhouse_, _tennis and horseshoe courts_) in the southwestern part of\r\nthe city is on ND 6.\r\n\r\nLeft from Mandan =1.3 m.= on a graveled road to the STATE TRAINING\r\nSCHOOL, to which modern buildings and well-landscaped grounds give\r\nthe appearance of an up-to-date preparatory school rather than an\r\ninstitution for delinquent juveniles. The school, which is one of four\r\nin the United States housing both boys and girls, and the only one\r\noffering a four-year high school course, teaches farming, carpentry,\r\ncooking, laundering, and sewing.\r\n\r\nOn the high bluffs on the south edge of the city is the U. S. NORTHERN\r\nGREAT PLAINS FIELD STATION (_see Side Tour 8C_).\r\n\r\nAt Mandan is the junction with ND 6, a graveled highway (_see Side Tour\r\n8C_).\r\n\r\nLeft from Mandan on 6th Ave. SE. which becomes a county graveled road\r\nand crosses the HEART RIVER, =1 m.=, which in Sioux translation is\r\ncalled Tacanta Wakpa Tanka.\r\n\r\nFORT ABRAHAM LINCOLN STATE PARK, =4.5 m.= (_see_ FORT ABRAHAM LINCOLN\r\nSTATE PARK).\r\n\r\nThe graveled road proceeds S. over the benchland of the Missouri to\r\nSCHMIDT, =11 m.=, an elevator and railroad siding. Here the route\r\nbecomes a graded dirt road, and continues S.\r\n\r\nAt =18 m.= the road cuts through an extending clay ridge which\r\nprotrudes like an eagle's beak from the Badlands-like formation to the\r\nR. To the W. here rises a flat-topped steep cliff jutting away from the\r\nother hills and connected with them only by a narrow neck. On this mesa\r\nonce stood the Eagle's Nose Village of the Mandans, believed by some\r\nto have been built by the great Mandan tribal hero Good Furred Robe,\r\nalthough this origin has also been attributed to the Huff Site (_see\r\nbelow_). To reach the old village site one must ascend the SW. side of\r\nthe hill. From the top there is a far-reaching view of the beautiful\r\nMissouri valley, stretching S. from the gray outlines of the capitol at\r\nBismarck and the blockhouses on the hill at Fort McKeen.\r\n\r\nAt =20 m.= is HUFF, a store and railroad station. At =20.5 m.= (L) is\r\nthe HUFF INDIAN VILLAGE STATE PARK, site of a Mandan village. According\r\nto legend the Mandan people at one time lived underground, but under\r\nthe leadership of four chiefs, headed by Good Furred Robe, they climbed\r\na vine to enter this world through an opening in the ground to the\r\nsurface. Good Furred Robe then laid out their first village, placing\r\nthe houses in rows like corn. This legend is believed by some Indians\r\nto refer to the Huff Site, whose heavily sodded lodge rings suggest\r\ngreat age. The reason for the somewhat rectangular shape of some of the\r\ndepressions has not yet been determined.\r\n\r\nSouth of Huff to FORT RICE STATE PARK, =29 m.=, the site of a fort\r\nestablished by Gen. Alfred H. Sully on his Indian expedition in 1864.\r\nIt served as a military post until 1877, when it was succeeded by\r\nFort Yates down the river. In 1868 Fort Rice was the scene of a peace\r\ncouncil with the Sioux. Sitting Bull and some five thousand followers,\r\nresentful of the appropriation of their lands by the white settlers,\r\nhad refused to go on reservations and had moved to the Powder River in\r\npresent Wyoming, where they lived the free, open life to which they\r\nwere accustomed. They harbored a bitter hatred for the white people,\r\nbut there was one white man whom Sitting Bull trusted. He was Father\r\nPierre Jean De Smet, a Jesuit missionary who had spent years among\r\nthe Indians of the western plains, and was sincerely interested in\r\ntheir welfare. He was known to the Sioux as \"Black Robe.\" The War\r\nDepartment and the Indian Bureau, eager to negotiate with the Sioux,\r\nsent Father De Smet to lead a delegation to Sitting Bull's camp. Many\r\nof the hostile Indians had vowed to kill any white man on sight, but\r\ntheir leader learned that it was \"Black Robe\" who was approaching,\r\nand welcomed him heartily. During the council which followed Father\r\nDe Smet gave Sitting Bull a brass and wood crucifix, which the Sioux\r\nleader, although he never professed Catholicism, prized highly all his\r\nlife. At the instigation of the priest, Sitting Bull, while refusing to\r\nattend a peace council himself, sent two representatives, Chief Gall\r\nand Bull Owl, whom he instructed to say, \"Move out the soldiers and\r\nstop the steamboats and we shall have peace.\" The peace council was\r\nheld at Fort Rice, and led to the Laramie Treaty later that year, which\r\nunfortunately was violated in 1875 by the Indian Bureau and the War\r\nDepartment, precipitating the hostilities that ended in the disastrous\r\nBattle of the Little Big Horn in June 1876 (_see_ HISTORY).\r\n\r\nWest of Mandan US 10 enters that part of the Missouri Plateau known\r\nlocally as the Missouri Slope, and proceeds over the rolling grasslands\r\ntypical of this area. As the route progresses through the Slope\r\nregion, buttes jutting up from the prairie become more numerous. Many\r\nare crowned with brick-red scoria (clay baked in the earth by the\r\nheat of burning lignite beds lying adjacent), and others have scoria\r\nformations protruding from their sides.\r\n\r\nAt =209.5 m.= is the junction with ND 25, a graveled highway (_see Side\r\nTour 8D_).\r\n\r\nAt =231 m.= (L) is the WRONG SIDE UP MONUMENT, a four-foot natural\r\nboulder bearing a bronze plate, commemorating an incident to which\r\nthe New Salem Holstein Breeders' Circuit, nationally known dairy\r\norganization, credits its success. As one of the early settlers was\r\nbreaking land preparatory to seeding it for the first time, a Sioux\r\nIndian and his son approached. The father, turning a piece of the sod\r\nback into its natural position, remarked, \"Wrong side up.\" His son\r\nexplained that the father believed the soil should not be plowed.\r\nThe farmer, heeding his advice, grazed cattle on his land instead.\r\nNeighbors followed his example, and today NEW SALEM, =232 m.= (2,163\r\nalt., 804 pop.), is the center of an extensive dairying area. The\r\ntown was named by members of the Evangelical Lutheran Church for the\r\nBiblical city of Salem.\r\n\r\nGLEN ULLIN, =251.5 m.= (2,065 alt., 950 pop.), a Russo-German\r\ncommunity, has a name suggested to a railroad official by the Scottish\r\nballad _Lord Ullin's Daughter_. An intermediate lighted airport is\r\nmaintained here by the Department of Commerce. Levon West, the etcher,\r\nonce attended Glen Ullin high school.\r\n\r\nHEBRON, =267 m.= (2,155 alt., 1,348 pop.), is in a small valley just W.\r\nof the divide between the Heart and Knife Rivers. Like New Salem, its\r\nname is of Biblical origin. The town has more brick-faced buildings in\r\nits business district than most towns of similar size because of the\r\nproximity of the $250,000 Hebron BRICK PLANT (_for directions inquire\r\nat post office_; _open weekdays 9-5_). Clay deposits suitable for\r\nbrick manufacture, discovered here in 1904, led to the development of\r\nthe field. The plant, on the eastern outskirts of the town, ships its\r\nproducts to all parts of the Northwest, the Pacific Coast States, and\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nEmil Krauth, son of one of Hebron's early settlers, is an authority\r\non butterflies, and received recognition of his work in 1935 when\r\nentomologists named a small yellow butterfly, _Colias christina\r\nkrauthii_, for him. At his residence he has a BUTTERFLY COLLECTION\r\n(_open; for directions inquire at post office_), 100 cases displaying\r\nspecimens gathered from many parts of the world.\r\n\r\nJust NW. of the town, where a cemetery now lies, FORT SAUERKRAUT was\r\nbuilt at the time of a false Indian scare in 1892. There is no record\r\nof why it was given its odd name.\r\n\r\nRight from Hebron on a country trail to CROWLEY FLINT QUARRY STATE\r\nPARK, =22 m.= Here the Indians obtained flint from which to make arrow\r\nand spear heads. The process of making an arrowhead or spear point\r\nwas tedious, the only tool being a piece of bone or horn that had\r\nbeen buried two weeks in wood ashes to remove grease and temper the\r\nmaterial. On the palm of one hand was placed a buckskin covering, and\r\non this was laid the flint, held in place by the fingers of the same\r\nhand. Using the bone tool in the other hand, the worker began flaking\r\nchips from the flint, first up one side and then the other, until the\r\nstone assumed the shape wanted. Today unfinished or broken arrowheads\r\nand spear points are occasionally found in the quarry.\r\n\r\nWest of ANTELOPE (L), =275 m.= (2,410 alt., 20 pop.), the route follows\r\nclosely the trail made by Custer's Seventh Cavalry in June 1876, on\r\ntheir way from Fort Abraham Lincoln to the Little Big Horn country in\r\nMontana, to meet death at the hands of the Sioux they pursued (_see_\r\nHISTORY). The deep ruts cut in the prairie by the military wagons of\r\nthe expedition, and later by those traveling over the same trail to\r\nFort Keogh, Mont., are visible R. and parallel to the highway where it\r\npasses S. of YOUNG MEN'S BUTTE, =277.5 m.= According to legend, when\r\nthe Arikara Indians were still living on the Grand River, in what is\r\nnow South Dakota, a group separated from the tribe and set out toward\r\nthe northwest to seek a new home. Two young men in the party, however,\r\ngrew lonesome for the sweethearts they had left behind, and when they\r\nreached this butte they decided to return to their old home. The\r\nremainder of the party continued on the journey, and was never heard\r\nfrom again.\r\n\r\nLeft from Antelope an unimproved dirt road leads to the Heart River, =8\r\nm.=, and the SITE OF GENERAL SULLY'S TEMPORARY BASE CAMP for the Battle\r\nof Killdeer Mountains. On his march to the Yellowstone River, in 1864,\r\nSully corraled his wagon train at this camp, and, traveling light,\r\nmoved quickly N. to the Killdeer Mountains to make a surprise attack on\r\na camp of 5,000 Sioux (_see Side Tour 8D_).\r\n\r\nRICHARDTON, =278 m.= (2,465 alt., 710 pop.), is the home of ASSUMPTION\r\nABBEY of the Benedictine order. The buildings, of Gothic and Romanesque\r\nstyles, give the impression of having been transplanted from ancient\r\nEurope to the North Dakota prairie. Twin red-roofed steeples raise\r\nburnished crosses above the buildings, which are constructed in a\r\nsquare around a garden court. The abbey, completed in 1910, includes\r\nSt. Mary's Monastery, St. Mary's Church, and a high school and junior\r\ncollege for boys. The library contains 14,000 volumes, among which are\r\nseveral books dated 1720 and bound in pigskin. The town is named for C.\r\nB. Richardton, official of a steamship company that sought homes for\r\nGerman immigrants, and is predominantly Russo-German.\r\n\r\nAt =284 m.= is TAYLOR (2,487 alt., 263 pop.). South of here along the\r\nHeart River are large deposits of bentonite; a clay used for commercial\r\nmanufacture of paints, cleaners, linoleum, cosmetics, and other\r\nproducts (_see_ INDUSTRY AND LABOR).\r\n\r\nAt =299.5 m.= is the junction with a graveled road.\r\n\r\nLeft on this road is LEHIGH, =2 m.= (2,347 alt., 203 pop.), named for\r\nLehigh, Pa., because both are mining towns. Here is a BRIQUETTING PLANT\r\n(_open to large parties and school or college groups; guides_). This\r\nis the only plant in the United States producing lignite briquets with\r\na B. t. u. (_British thermal unit: 778 foot-pounds energy_) rating of\r\n15,000. Raw lignite has a B. t. u. rating of about 6,500. Eighteen\r\nthousand tons of briquets are produced annually by the million dollar\r\nplant. The work of the late E. J. Babcock of the State university has\r\nbeen of great importance in adapting the lignite briquetting process\r\nto North Dakota coal. The chief byproduct of the plant is creosote, of\r\nwhich about 70,000 gallons are shipped to eastern markets each year.\r\nResearch conducted on activated carbon, a lignite product used in the\r\nmanufacture of tires and for filtration purposes, points to commercial\r\ndevelopment of this byproduct (_see_ INDUSTRY AND LABOR).\r\n\r\nDICKINSON, =302.5 m.= (2,305 alt., 5,025 pop.), principal stock and\r\nwheat shipping point in the central Missouri Slope area, and Stark\r\nCounty seat, is on the slope of a hill overlooking the Heart River,\r\nwhich cuts through the prairie S. of the city. The town is still young\r\nenough to retain much of the friendly atmosphere of the early West.\r\n\r\nWhen the railroad reached this point in 1880, the site was known as\r\nPleasant Valley Siding, but in 1883 the name was changed by H. L.\r\nDickinson, the town's first merchant, to honor his cousin Wells S.\r\nDickinson, a New York State senator.\r\n\r\nThe town defeated Gladstone and Belfield for county seat in 1884, and\r\nthe same year saw its development as a forwarding point for freight\r\nto the booming Black Hills gold fields. On April 15 alone, more than\r\n220,000 lbs. of freight destined for the Hills were received at\r\nDickinson.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 the Dickinson _Press_ reported: \"The first Fourth of July\r\ncelebration attempted in Dickinson took place last Monday. It exceeded\r\nthe anticipation of all and proved to be a grand success--a day that\r\nwill long be remembered. The day dawned bright and cool. Early in the\r\nmorning people began to arrive and by ten o'clock the largest crowd\r\never assembled in Stark County lined the principal streets. The train\r\nfrom the west brought a number of Medora people. Amongst them was Hon.\r\nTheodore Roosevelt, the orator of the day. The celebration consisted\r\nof: A Parade, Addresses by Hon. Theodore Roosevelt and Hon. John A.\r\nRae, Races, Fire Works, and a dance in the evening.\"\r\n\r\nRusso-German immigrants seeking homes in this country were early\r\nattracted to Dickinson by the Catholic mission established there\r\nby Bishop Martin Marty of St. Paul, and today the southern part of\r\nthe city is a Russo-German settlement, almost a town within a town.\r\nAlthough the younger generation is Americanized, the older women still\r\nwear old-fashioned, long, dark dresses, and cover their heads with dark\r\nscarfs or _tuecher_. There are halls for social functions, and for the\r\ngala wedding dances which often last several days.\r\n\r\nThe $2,000,000 plant of the DICKINSON FIRE AND PRESSED BRICK CO.\r\n(_open_) adjoins the city on the S. The plant, which has a capacity of\r\n20,000 bricks daily, utilizes the various clays found in the company's\r\n200 acres along the Heart River. Fine pottery is also manufactured.\r\nAmong the clays used is a rare plastic clay which is worked into sewer\r\npipe and fire brick, and produces a fine buff shade for facing bricks.\r\nIn addition there are clays, semi-shales, and red clays that are worked\r\ninto old red sandstone, red, and terra cotta shades for facing.\r\n\r\nIn the northern part of the city are the DICKINSON COUNTRY CLUB\r\n(_golf_), WHITNEY SWIMMING POOL (_open June-Sept._; _nominal fee_), and\r\nATHLETIC FIELD (_gridiron_, _baseball diamond_, _running track_, _and\r\ntennis courts_), and ROCKY BUTTE PARK (_picnicking_).\r\n\r\nAtop a knoll on 10th Ave. W. is the campus of the DICKINSON STATE\r\nNORMAL SCHOOL. Its buildings, in English Tudor style, constructed of\r\nHebron brick with white sandstone trim, were not occupied until 1924,\r\nalthough classes were held in the Dickinson Elks building as early as\r\n1918. On the top floor of May Hall is a natural history museum.\r\n\r\nLeft (S) from Dickinson on ND 22 to a U. S. Department of Commerce\r\nintermediate AIRPORT, =6 m.=\r\n\r\nAt =303.5 m=, is a junction with a graveled road.\r\n\r\nRight on this road to the DICKINSON SUBSTATION AND NORTH DAKOTA\r\nAGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION, =2 m.= Here, under State and Federal\r\nsupervision, experiments are conducted in fruit production, dry land\r\nfarming, and the raising of forage and cereal crops.\r\n\r\nAt =320 m.= is the junction with a graveled spur.\r\n\r\nLeft on this spur is SOUTH HEART, =1 m.= (2,474 alt., 150 pop.) so\r\nnamed because of its position on the southern bank of the Heart River.\r\nOne mile W. of the town the trail made in 1864 by Gen. Alfred Sully\r\nand his troops on their return from the Battle of Killdeer Mountain is\r\nplainly visible. South of the town on a country trail is CUSTER HILL,\r\n=7 m.=, where Custer made camp on his way to the Big Horn country\r\nin Montana in 1876. Breastworks thrown up as a protection are still\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nBELFIELD, =322 m.= (2,578 alt., 653 pop.), is in a small valley along\r\na tributary of the Heart River. The Dakota Colloidal Corp., which\r\noperates the only BENTONITE PLANT (_open weekdays 9-4_) in the State,\r\nprocures the mineral from a clay found N. of town, and uses it in the\r\nmanufacture of soaps and washing powders. Here is a junction with US 85\r\n(_see Tour 4_).\r\n\r\nAt =330 m.= the route comes dramatically upon the BADLANDS, cut into\r\nthe heart of the plateau. In every direction stretches a confusion of\r\nbare, grotesque, garish buttes, their tops level with the surrounding\r\nprairies. Down their sides broad earth strata--brown, ash gray,\r\nsulphur yellow, and salmon--deposited through geological ages, have\r\nbeen exposed by years of erosion. French explorers named this region\r\n_mauvaises terres a traverser_, or bad lands to travel through.\r\n\r\nRight at =332 m.= is PAINTED CANYON with its jumble of gorges and\r\nsuperb buttes. Spread as far as one can see toward the northern horizon\r\nis a magnificent display of buttes, showing in varying light and shadow\r\nthe great charm of this never-monotonous country. A drive lined with a\r\nwall of brick-red scoria (_see_ NATURAL SETTING), mottled with green,\r\nlike weathered bronze, parallels the highway, providing a good point\r\nfrom which to take photographs.\r\n\r\nAs the highway descends into the Badlands, it twists through ravines\r\nand valleys. At =335 m.= is the eastern entrance to the SOUTH ROOSEVELT\r\nREGIONAL STATE PARK (_see_ ROOSEVELT REGIONAL STATE PARKS).\r\n\r\nMEDORA, =341.5 m.= (2,265 alt., 200 pop.), seat of Billings County,\r\nlies along the eastern bank of the Little Missouri River, at the foot\r\nof a steep wall of yellow clay cliffs. Now a center for tourists\r\nattracted by its history and the scenic beauty of the surrounding\r\narea, it was formerly such a bustling cattle town that on one occasion\r\na thousand Texas steers stampeded across the tracks and stopped a\r\ntrain. In the same era, it is said, the more or less adequately named\r\nson of the plains, Hell-Roaring Bill Jones, saw an old gentleman in a\r\nderby get off the train here. Derbies and plug hats were especially\r\nscorned by the cowboys, so with a grunt of disapproval Bill shot off\r\nthe offending bit of haberdashery. The gentleman hastened to reenter\r\nthe train, leaving his dismantled headgear to the West. But not so Bill\r\nJones: \"Come back!\" he roared in tones that compelled obedience. \"We\r\ndon't want the blinkety-blank thing in Medora.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1879 a military camp named Little Missouri (_see below_) was\r\nestablished here on the opposite river bank to protect workers of the\r\nN. P. Ry. from Indian attacks. This typically rough frontier post saw\r\nthe arrival in 1883 of two notable young men of almost the same age.\r\nTheodore Roosevelt, a young New York assemblyman of 25, traveling for\r\nhis health and also to forget the recent loss of both his mother and\r\nwife, already displayed the rugged, direct personality which later\r\ncharacterized the wielder of the \"big stick.\" Because of his eastern\r\ndress and his heavy glasses he became known as \"the four-eyed dude\r\nfrom New York\", or, more briefly, \"Four-eyes\"--until one evening with\r\nhis naked fists he knocked out and disarmed a bully. Thereafter his\r\nnickname was subtly changed to \"Old Four-eyes.\"\r\n\r\nThe other young man was the Marquis de Mores, a handsome, spirited\r\nFrenchman. Arriving in America about six months earlier with his\r\nbride, the rich and charming Medora Von Hoffman of New York, he had\r\nmade a hunting trip to the West and, with characteristic dash, decided\r\nto build a packing plant in the cattle country to capitalize on the\r\nadvantage of avoiding the cost of shipping live animals to eastern\r\nabattoirs. Wealthy in his own right and backed by his millionaire\r\nfather-in-law, de Mores came to the wild Badlands to build the plant\r\nthat was to be the center of operations for the Northern Pacific\r\nRefrigerator Car Co., incorporated to operate in five Territories and\r\nnine States, and to do a general transportation business.\r\n\r\nBecause of some disagreement over contemplated real estate purchases\r\nin Little Missouri, de Mores bought a huge tract of land on the east\r\nside of the river, where he built his packing plant and with it a town,\r\nnamed Medora for his wife.\r\n\r\nIn the middle eighties Medora, together with Mingusville (present\r\nWibaux, Mont.), had become the center of a new, rich, cattle-grazing\r\nsection. The round-up area extended to a radius of 75 m., and in some\r\nround-ups as many as 100 men were employed. Large outfits ran probably\r\n100,000 head, and ranchers like Roosevelt, who grazed 2,000 to 3,000\r\nhead, were considered small cattlemen.\r\n\r\nMany factors operated against the success of de Mores' packing\r\nplant, which opened in the fall of 1883. He himself was young, rash,\r\ninexperienced, and often ill-advised. His friends found him honest and\r\nconfiding, and less open minds than his took advantage of him. There\r\nwere costly mistakes, and many hundreds of thousands were spent before\r\nany meat was sold. Moreover, eastern packers undersold de Mores and\r\nforced ruinously low prices. Since he had to depend on grass for feed,\r\nhe could supply his trade from his own stock only at certain seasons,\r\nand at the other times had to buy from outside parties, who took\r\nadvantage of the situation to charge him high prices. A plan to feed\r\ncattle at Medora never materialized. De Mores ran sheep, but hundreds\r\ndied. To cap it all, the public apparently did not like grass-fed meat.\r\n\r\nAnother ill-starred enterprise was the Medora-Deadwood stage line,\r\nbegun in the fall of 1884 with the idea of securing a mail contract\r\nand some of the passenger and freight traffic going to the Black Hills\r\ngold fields by way of Dickinson. The route from Medora to Deadwood was\r\nshorter than that from Dickinson, but it was also rougher. De Mores'\r\nhorses were wild, and often broke up equipment. In addition, the mail\r\ncontract failed to materialize; the shift from placer to deep mining\r\nlessened the flow of transients into the Hills; and after one trip over\r\nthe rough road, freight shippers usually chose the Dickinson route. The\r\nline was ordered discontinued in the spring of 1886, ending another of\r\nthe marquis' dreams.\r\n\r\nMany people of the Little Missouri Valley did not like de Mores. They\r\ndoubted his claim to the peerage, or, if they believed it, regarded\r\nit as an affront to their almost belligerent democracy. Such things\r\nas his special car on the N. P. Ry. and his occasional trips East or\r\nabroad irked them. Worst of all, he began to fence his land--a glaring\r\ninfraction of wide-open range etiquette. His fences were cut; he had\r\nthem mended. They were cut open again. Things went from bad to worse.\r\nStories were carried to de Mores of threats against his life. He\r\nappealed to the sheriff at Mandan for the arrest of the trouble makers.\r\nWhen the deputy sheriff arrived, they bluffed him out, and de Mores,\r\nthinking the deputy overpowered or perhaps killed, endeavored to make\r\nthe arrest. There was shooting, and when the smoke cleared, one man was\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nThis was in June 1883. Twice dismissed by lower courts, the charge\r\nagainst de Mores was finally brought in district court in Bismarck\r\nin September 1885. He was acquitted. About a year after the trial,\r\nrealizing that his packing plant was not to be a success, he closed its\r\ndoors, and took his family to Europe. At the age of 38, while on an\r\nexpedition to Africa, he was ambushed and killed by native guides.\r\n\r\nExcept for his neighbor Roosevelt, the Badlands have never known a more\r\nnotable figure than this Frenchman with his dreams of their industrial\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nTheodore Roosevelt was a frequent visitor at the de Mores' chateau\r\n(_see below_) during the months he spent in Dakota Territory. On his\r\nfirst hunting trip here in 1883 he was so attracted by the wild country\r\nthat he made arrangements to become a partner in a ranching enterprise,\r\nand for the next six years he spent part of each year here, first at\r\nthe Maltese Cross, or Chimney Butte Ranch (_see_ BISMARCK), 7 m. up the\r\nLittle Missouri, and later at the Elkhorn, 35 m. downstream (_see Tour\r\n10_). Both ranch sites are difficult to reach, and little is to be seen\r\nat them other than the sites where the buildings stood.\r\n\r\nRoosevelt's ranching ventures were not financially successful; he ran\r\nsmall herds, and was interested more in the condition of his health\r\nthan that of his fortune. His keen delight in hunting and the rough\r\ncowboy life, however, won him many friends. In the spring of 1884 he\r\nacted as chairman of the local Stockmen's Association, and the same\r\nyear he was the principal speaker at Dickinson's first Fourth of July\r\ncelebration. One day a cowboy overheard someone say, \"That fool Joe\r\nFerris [a Medora storekeeper] says Roosevelt is going to be President.\"\r\nSeventeen years later the cowboy told this to Ferris; the death of\r\nMcKinley had just made Roosevelt President.\r\n\r\nIn company with the other stockmen of the valley, Roosevelt lost\r\nheavily in the severe winter of 1886-87. It is said that scarcely a\r\nrancher did not lose at least half his stock--the Hash-Knife, a large\r\noutfit, lost 65,000 head.\r\n\r\nRoosevelt's trips to the West thereafter were of shorter duration. One\r\nof the strongest links that bound him to this country was his famous\r\nRough Riders, made up mainly of western men, who served under him\r\nin the Spanish-American War. Roosevelt visited Medora in 1900, on a\r\ncampaign tour, and again in 1903, and was warmly received each time by\r\nhis old neighbors and friends.\r\n\r\nMedora was briefly the home of Tom Mix, screen actor, who was married\r\nhere to Olive M. Stokes, Jan. 19, 1909. Mix, then a circus performer,\r\nand Miss Stokes had just completed contracts with the Miller Brothers'\r\n101 Ranch Wild West Show.\r\n\r\nRight at the entrance to Main St. is the little buff brick ATHENAIS\r\nCHAPEL, built for the marquise by her husband in 1884, and named for\r\ntheir daughter. It was presented to the village in 1920 by members of\r\nthe de Mores family, and is still in use as the Roman Catholic church\r\nof the community.\r\n\r\nFronting Main St. is the ROUGH RIDERS HOTEL, erected by de Mores in\r\n1884. It served as headquarters for cattlemen and cowpunchers of the\r\nday; and although it was built a year after Theodore Roosevelt came\r\nto Dakota, the story is told that his first night in Medora was spent\r\nhere. Doubtless, however, he spent many nights in the hotel, which\r\nsuggested to him the name of his Spanish-American War regiment.\r\n\r\nOne block down Main St. (L) is a bronze STATUE OF MARQUIS DE MORES,\r\nerected by the family in 1926. It stands in a small plot which is part\r\nof De Mores State Park, three tracts comprising about 77 acres, deeded\r\nto the State Historical Society of North Dakota in 1936 by Louis, Count\r\nde Vallombrosa, eldest son of the marquis. On a second unit of the\r\npark, in the northwestern part of town, is the SITE OF THE DE MORES\r\nPACKING PLANT. The abandoned buildings, with mammoth refrigerators\r\nand machinery and mysterious dark passages, long bore the legend,\r\n\"Rent free to any responsible party who will make use of them.\" Fire\r\ndestroyed them in 1907; all that remains today is a tall, gaunt, yellow\r\nbrick chimney.\r\n\r\nLeft from Medora on a winding graded county dirt road to the CUSTER\r\nTRAIL RANCH, =5 m.=, named by its founders, Howard, Willis, and Alden\r\nEaton, for its position on the trail of the fatal military expedition\r\nto the Little Big Horn in 1876. It is at the confluence of the Little\r\nMissouri River and Davis Creek, where a Custer camp erected parapets\r\nfor protection from possible Indian attack. Deep ruts cut by the wagons\r\nof the expedition are still visible near the ranch buildings. This\r\nranch was established in the late 1880's, and is the first of the \"dude\r\nranches\" which have become so popular in the West. The owners were\r\nneighbors of Roosevelt, whose Chimney Butte Ranch was 2 m. upstream.\r\nIn 1897 Ernest Thompson Seton, naturalist and author, while gathering\r\nmaterial for his books _Lives of the Hunted_ and _Coyotito_, spent the\r\nmonth of September here with the Eatons. The ranch still has its quota\r\nof summer visitors, but in the early 1900's the Eatons transferred\r\ntheir activities to the vicinity of the Big Horn Mountains.\r\n\r\nAt =341.7 m.= the route crosses the bridge leading over the LITTLE\r\nMISSOURI RIVER. Except in times of flood the stream, which is narrow\r\nhere, is shallow and sluggish.\r\n\r\nAt =341.8 m.= is the junction with an improved road.\r\n\r\nLeft on this road to the third unit (60 A.) of the De Mores State\r\nPark, the DE MORES CHATEAU, =0.5 m.=, commanding an excellent view\r\nof the river, the bluffs, and the village. The chateau is a 28-room,\r\n2-story frame structure with a wide veranda, and windows guarded by\r\nold-fashioned shutters.\r\n\r\nDeserted by its wealthy young owners and their retinue of servants,\r\nand subjected to the aging of half a century, it presents a vastly\r\ndifferent picture from that of 1883, when the ambitious Frenchman built\r\nit for his red-haired bride.\r\n\r\nAlthough the establishment of the packing plant was de Mores' chief\r\nreason for being in Dakota, he and the marquise led an active social\r\nlife, entertaining settlers of the region and also many distinguished\r\nguests from the East and from Europe, who came to hunt. An item in the\r\nBismarck _Tribune_ of Sept. 4, 1885, read:\r\n\r\n                        \"She Killed Three Bears\r\n\r\n  \"The Marquise, wife of Marquis de Mores, has returned from her\r\n  hunt in the Rocky mountains, where she killed two cinnamon bears\r\n  and one large grizzly bear. The accomplished lady, who was a few\r\n  years ago one of New York City's popular society belles, is now the\r\n  queen of the Rocky mountains and the champion huntress of the great\r\n  northwest.\"\r\n\r\n  During their residence in America two children were born to the de\r\n  Mores, a son, Louis, and a daughter, Athenais. A third child, Paul,\r\n  was born in France soon after the family left Medora. The marquise\r\n  died in 1920 as the result of an injury received while serving as a\r\n  nurse in the World War. Although she returned to Medora only once\r\n  (1893), she removed nothing from the chateau to which she came as a\r\n  bride. It was left in the hands of a caretaker until its transfer\r\n  to the State historical society in 1936.\r\n\r\nAt =341.9 m.= (L) are the partly filled cellar holes that mark the\r\nSITE OF LITTLE MISSOURI, Medora's predecessor. The story is told that,\r\nduring the heyday of the town, passengers on a train pausing opposite a\r\nhotel here heard the sound of shots. Presently, to their horror, the\r\ndoor opened and a group of cowboys carried out a limp body. Soon there\r\nwere more shots, and another body was brought out. Before the train\r\nleft the cowboys figured they had given the \"dudes\" an eyeful. The\r\n\"bodies\" all belonged to the same man, and the shots had been aimed so\r\nas to do no harm.\r\n\r\nAt =343 m.= is the junction with a graveled road.\r\n\r\nRight on this road to the sandstone pillars marking the western\r\nentrance to the South Roosevelt Regional State Park, =0.1 m.= (_see_\r\nROOSEVELT REGIONAL STATE PARKS).\r\n\r\nAt =347.5 m.= is the first glimpse of FLAT TOP BUTTE (L), sometimes\r\nknown as Square Butte, whose mesa-like top contains nearly a section\r\nof land. On a slope of this butte occurred a skirmish between Sully's\r\npunitive expedition of 1864 and a band of Hunkpapa and Sans Arc Sioux\r\nled by Sitting Bull. Harried by a sniping fire from the Sioux, the\r\n2,200 soldiers, on quarter rations because of insufficient supplies,\r\nand burdened with an immigrant train of 600 people and 120 oxcarts,\r\nhad sweltered through a hot August day. Just as darkness was closing\r\nover the Badlands they discovered a spring on the northeastern slope\r\nof Flat Top Butte, only to have Sitting Bull, who realized their need\r\nof the water, suddenly pour in a heavy fire from the nearby hills. The\r\nfiring continued intermittently all night. In the morning, however, the\r\nSioux withdrew and went hunting. Several Indians were killed during the\r\nencounter and many soldiers wounded.\r\n\r\nAt =355.5 m.= the highway reaches the level prairie after a gradual\r\nrise out of the Badlands. From here is visible (L) Sentinel Butte\r\n(3,350 alt.), second highest point in the State, a large flat-topped\r\nmesa in the distance. Right is the CAMEL'S HUMP, a peculiarly rounded,\r\ngrass-covered hill.\r\n\r\nAt =358 m.= is the village of SENTINEL BUTTE (2,706 alt., 219 pop.),\r\nwhich was named for the nearby mesa to the S. The Sully expedition,\r\nfollowing its encounter with the Sioux at Flat Top, passed over the\r\npresent town site.\r\n\r\nLeft from the town on a graveled road to the junction with a county\r\ndirt road, =3 m.=; L. here to a gate (L) at =4.3 m.=; follow rutted\r\ntrail to foot of southern slope of SENTINEL BUTTE, =5 m.= In a pass at\r\nthe top of this slope are two supposed graves of sentinels killed while\r\non guard. Conflicting stories are told of the sentinels' identity.\r\nOne Indian legend says romance was involved in the slaying of the\r\ntwo; another, that they were Arikara scouts surprised by a Sioux war\r\nparty. Nearly 80 acres of grassland are on the flat top of Sentinel\r\nButte, and its precipitous sandstone cliff-sides rise 719 ft. above the\r\nsurrounding prairies. From the eastern rim of the butte on a clear day\r\nis a panorama of the Badlands, with Flat Top Butte in the foreground,\r\nand the diggings of several private lignite coal mines visible in the\r\nslopes of the neighboring hills. To the S. and W. the plain stretches\r\naway into the distance: nicely squared patches of green in the spring\r\nand early summer, rippling areas of gold during harvest, and squares\r\nof plowed black earth etched against patches of grimy yellow stubble in\r\nthe fall.\r\n\r\nBEACH, =365.5 m.= (2,755 alt., 1,263 pop.), is named for Capt. Warren\r\nBeach of the Eleventh Infantry, who accompanied the Stanley railroad\r\nsurvey expedition in 1873. Beach is Golden Valley County seat, center\r\nof a large agricultural area in western North Dakota and eastern\r\nMontana, and a grain shipping point. John M. Baer, the political\r\ncartoonist, was postmaster in Beach from 1913 to 1915, and later became\r\na North Dakota Congressman.\r\n\r\nUS 10 crosses the Montana Line, =368 m.=, 42 m. E. of Glendive Mont.\r\n(_see Mont. Tour 1_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIDE TOUR 8A\r\n\r\n\r\n  Valley City--Oakes--South Dakota Line. ND 1.\r\n\r\n  Valley City to South Dakota Line, 75 m.\r\n\r\n  N. P.

Near the southern border\r\nof the State the highway runs across the level bed of glacial Lake\r\nDakota, a small part of which extended into present North Dakota. This\r\nlake existed before Lake Agassiz, in the valley of the James River,\r\nwhich was in existence before the second ice age. Along the entire\r\nroute pheasants are plentiful.\r\n\r\nND 1 branches S. from US 10 at Valley City (_see Tour 8_).\r\n\r\nAt =19 m.= is the junction with a graveled road.\r\n\r\nLeft on this road to BIRCH CREEK HISTORIC SITE (_picnic and camp\r\ngrounds adjoining_), =1 m.= In the late 1830's the Federal Government\r\nsent its first exploratory expedition into this area under Jean N.\r\nNicollet and Lt. John C. Fremont. Their party camped in this coulee on\r\nBirch Creek in 1839. In August 1863 a detachment of the Sibley Indian\r\nexpedition under Col. Samuel McPhail also camped here, naming the site\r\nCamp Johnson for one of the officers. Later, in 1867-72, the Fort\r\nTotten-Fort Ransom trail crossed the coulee.\r\n\r\nHASTINGS, =19.5 m.= (1,453 alt., 125 pop.), was named by the N. P. Ry.\r\nfor Hastings, Minn., which in turn was named for Gen. Henry Hastings\r\nSibley (1811-1891), first Governor of Minnesota, and in 1863 commander\r\nof an expedition against the Sioux.\r\n\r\nAt =23.5 m.= is the junction with ND 46, a graveled highway.\r\n\r\nLeft on this highway to the junction with an unimproved country trail,\r\n=7 m.=; R. here =0.5 m.= to INYAN BOSDATA, or Standing Rock, one of two\r\nrocks within the boundaries of North Dakota sacred to the Sioux tribes\r\n(_see Side Tour 8C_). The Sioux are reticent concerning legends of the\r\nstone, saying only that it is _waukan_ (mysterious). About 4 ft. high,\r\nit is roughly shaped like an inverted cone, and stands atop a circular\r\nmound, from which long, narrow mounds extend both E. and W. The\r\nsignificance of the mound on which it stands is not definitely known,\r\nbut it is believed to be of ceremonial origin. Positions of skeletons\r\nand types of artifacts found in the different strata of the few mounds\r\nexcavated in this area lead archeologists to believe that the mounds\r\nwere built for burial purposes. Discoveries in the oldest stratum\r\nindicate that after the retreat of the glacier the race which built the\r\nmounds was nomadic, living by the hunt and on edible tubers found in\r\nthe region, while artifacts found in later strata reveal that the race\r\nhad probably become agricultural and lived in permanent villages.\r\n\r\nAt =9 m.= on ND 46 is the junction with an unimproved dirt road; L.\r\nhere =1 m.= to CAMP WEISER HISTORIC SITE, named for Dr. J. S. Weiser,\r\nsurgeon with the First Minnesota Mounted Rangers, who was later killed\r\nin the Battle of Big Mound (_see Tour 8_). This was an encampment of\r\nthe Sibley expedition the night of July 13-14, 1863.\r\n\r\nAt =30.5 m.= on ND 1 is the junction with a graveled road.\r\n\r\nLeft here is FORT RANSOM, =7 m.= (1,217 alt., 297 pop.), a quiet little\r\nvillage hidden in the trees at the foot of the hill on which are the\r\nRUINS OF OLD FORT RANSOM. Thousands of Civil War veterans, released\r\nfrom service, turned to the West for opportunity, crossing the plains\r\nto the gold fields in Montana and Idaho. To keep the hostile Sioux\r\nin check and to guard the immigrant wagon trains on their overland\r\njourneys, it was planned to establish a chain of forts across the\r\nprairies. Fort Ransom was the first of this chain, built in 1867\r\nby Gen. Alfred Terry and named for Gen. Thomas Ransom, a Civil War\r\nofficer. It was protected by sod and log breastworks 12 ft. high,\r\nsurrounded by a ditch 8 ft. deep, a protection never greatly needed,\r\nfor few Indians lived in the vicinity. In 1872 Fort Ransom was replaced\r\nby Fort Seward at Jamestown (_see Tour 8_). Remains of the breastworks\r\nof the fortification are visible.\r\n\r\nAcross the deep ravine running N. and W. of the fort a lookout post\r\nwas situated on BEAR DEN HILLOCK which the Sioux know as Matoti. On\r\nthe slope of this hill is a large glaciated _Writing Rock_, on the\r\nsurface of which are four deep grooves. These the Indians believe to\r\nhave been written by spirits. Two legends are told of the stone: one,\r\nthat a water sprite traced the markings with his finger, the other that\r\ntwo young women spirits came daily to write messages to the tribes,\r\nuntil the invasion of the white man, when they refused to send further\r\nmessages. Several tumuli of the mound builders are on this hill.\r\n\r\nAt =36.5 m.= on ND 1 is the junction with ND 27, a graveled highway.\r\n\r\nLeft here is LISBON, =18 m.= (1,187 alt., 1,650 pop.), Ransom County\r\nseat, named by two settlers for their home cities, Lisbon, N. Y. and\r\nLisbon, Ill. The first settlers arrived in 1878, and two years later\r\nthe town site was platted. Situated at the foot of the hills bordering\r\nthe Sheyenne River, the town is scattered on both wooded banks of\r\nthe stream. The red-brick buildings of the STATE SOLDIERS HOME, in\r\nlandscaped grounds in the southern section of the town, accommodate 50\r\nveterans. SANDAGER PARK in the northwestern part is a well-maintained\r\nrecreational center (_short boat trips up river available in summer;\r\nreasonable fares_). W. D. Boyce (1860-1912), Lisbon newspaper publisher\r\nduring the 1880's, who became publisher of the _Saturday Blade_ in\r\nChicago, is credited with bringing the Boy Scout idea to the United\r\nStates from England, and a fine BOY SCOUT BUILDING AND PARK on Main St.\r\nare a memorial to him. R. N. Stevens (1852-1925), a Lisbon attorney and\r\nmember of the State constitutional convention in 1889, later associated\r\nwith Alexander McKenzie in Alaska, is characterized as the crafty\r\nattorney in Rex Beach's novel _The Spoilers_.\r\n\r\nLeft from Lisbon =1 m.= on ND 9 to OAKWOOD CEMETERY, the land for which\r\nwas a gift of William K. Thaw, a large landholder here in early days.\r\nIt contains the graves of many soldiers. In the center of the area is\r\na statue of a bugler in the pose of sounding taps, a memorial to the\r\nCivil War dead.\r\n\r\nAt =22 m.= on ND 27 is the junction with a graveled road; R. here =2\r\nm.= to the junction with another graveled road; L. to another junction\r\nat =3 m.=; R. to the SITE OF CAMP HAYES, =4.8 m.= On the first bench\r\nabove the level Sheyenne River flood plain Gen. H. H. Sibley and his\r\nIndian expedition camped a week in July 1863 while awaiting supplies\r\nand mail from Fort Abercrombie. At each of his camps Sibley erected\r\nbreastworks of some type, and remains of the ravine trenches at this\r\nsite are still visible. Like giant, round anthills, several tumuli of\r\nthe mound builders project against the sky line on the hills bordering\r\nthe river opposite Camp Hayes. The largest of the hills along the river\r\nhere is OKIEDAN BUTTE, meaning _place where they all rushed together_,\r\nfamed in Sioux legend. At the foot of the hill, near a spring still\r\nflowing, a Sisseton Sioux war party is said to have attacked and killed\r\na band of 30 Arikara Indians. At this same place in the early 1880's\r\nBvt. Gen. H. M. Creel of the U. S. Regulars reported having his command\r\nentirely surrounded by so large a herd of bison that it stretched\r\nbeyond the vision of his field glasses, and took several hours in\r\npassing.\r\n\r\nAt =26 m.= on ND 27 is the junction with an unimproved dirt road; R.\r\nhere =3 m.= to the CHEYENNE INDIAN VILLAGE SITE. A springhouse (L)\r\nstands at the entrance to the ear-shaped site. Depressions mark the\r\nposition of the earth lodges that once stood here. A moat is still\r\nvisible around the entire site. Many artifacts have been excavated,\r\nincluding traces of pottery. The homes of the Cheyennes were circular\r\nlodges, constructed of earth over a frame of logs, similar to those\r\nof the Mandan and Hidatsa Indians who lived along the Missouri\r\nRiver (_see Side Tour 3A and Tour 8_). In the eighteenth century the\r\nCheyennes were forced into South Dakota and Wyoming by the continued\r\nattacks of the Sioux and Chippewa.\r\n\r\nSTRONG MEMORIAL PARK (_picnic and camp grounds_), =3.3 m.=, is across\r\nthe road (R) from the Indian village site. The land was given the State\r\nhistorical society by Frank Strong, and is a memorial to him.\r\n\r\nND 1 continues S. to VERONA, =41 m.= (1,383 alt., 222 pop.), first\r\nsettled in the spring of 1883, and named for the city in northern Italy.\r\n\r\nAt =42 m.= is the junction with ND 13, a graveled highway.\r\n\r\nLeft here is LAMOURE, =10 m.= (1,304 alt., 889 pop.), named for Judson\r\nLaMoure (1839-1918), an early political power in the State. It is\r\nsituated on the banks of the James River, and is the center of a large\r\ndairying area. Its history dates from the arrival of the railroad\r\nin 1883. As the community grew, an intense rivalry was born between\r\nLaMoure and Grand Rapids (_see below_), a rivalry that did not end\r\nuntil LaMoure, in a hot fight in 1886, won the LaMoure County seat from\r\nGrand Rapids, which thereafter declined. Like other frontier towns,\r\nLaMoure had many gaming houses and saloons. Residences being scarce,\r\none pious family was forced to live above a saloon. When it came\r\ntime for the wife to entertain the weekly prayer meeting, the saloon\r\nclosed out of deference, and the next issue of the LaMoure _Chronicle_\r\nmentioned the incident thus: \"There were spirits above and spirits\r\nbelow. The spirits below were spirits of wine, and the spirits above\r\nwere spirits divine.\" One year LaMoure had no speaker for a Fourth\r\nof July celebration, while a popular speaker, Dr. E. P. Robertson of\r\nFargo, had been engaged by Grand Rapids. He arrived at Lisbon, the end\r\nof the railroad line, and was met by a fine four-horse team and the\r\nbest carriage to be found. The driver shouted, \"All aboard for Grand\r\nRapids! Right this way for Dr. Robertson!\" and the unsuspecting doctor\r\nwas driven to LaMoure, delivered a glowing address, was returned to\r\nLisbon by the same rig, and reached home without having learned of his\r\nerror. An occasion for excitement in LaMoure was the arrival of the\r\nsteamer _Nettie Baldwin_ in the late summer of 1883. The boat docked at\r\na pontoon bridge, and some citizens had visions of the town's becoming\r\nan important river port. Of a second trip in 1884 the _Chronicle_\r\nrecalls: \"The climax to speculation concerning a regular commercial\r\nroute came suddenly and sadly. _Nettie Baldwin_ couldn't cut the buck,\r\nor was it the mud?\" The boat was left in the water, where it lay for\r\nmany years.\r\n\r\nAt =13 m.= on ND 13 is the junction with ND 63, a graveled highway;\r\nR. here is GRAND RAPIDS, =19 m.= (1,320 alt., 60 pop.), named for the\r\ncataract in the James River at this point. The little village, once a\r\nprosperous county seat, lies at one of the widest points of the James\r\nRiver flood plain. It was the first organized town in LaMoure County,\r\nand until 1886 was the county seat. In that year it lost the position\r\nto LaMoure after a bitter struggle, although the editor of the LaMoure\r\n_Chronicle_ dared to sympathize with Grand Rapids, to an extent that\r\nwon him in his home city the title of \"Leper of LaMoure.\"\r\n\r\nOn ND 63 to LAMOURE COUNTY MEMORIAL PARK (_picnic and camp grounds_,\r\n_playgrounds_, _swimming_, _horseshoe courts_, _athletic field_),\r\n=20 m.=, is a 53-acre tract along the James River, established as a\r\nmemorial to LaMoure County World War dead. Many county gatherings are\r\nheld here each summer.\r\n\r\nND 1, S. of Verona, continues over the level prairie. At =57 m.= is a\r\njunction with ND 11, which unites with ND 1 between this point and =70\r\nm.=\r\n\r\nOAKES, =58 m.= (1,310 alt., 1,709 pop.), on a level rise of ground 1\r\nm. E. of the James River, is at the extreme northern end of the bed of\r\nglacial Lake Dakota. The town site was platted in 1886 at the junction\r\nof the N. P. and North Western Rys., and was named for Thomas Fletcher\r\nOakes (1843-1911), one-time vice president and general manager of the\r\nN. P. Ry. A short time later the Soo Line built into the new community,\r\nand these railroad facilities were a factor in the rapid growth of the\r\ntown. It was incorporated as a city in 1888. The foresight of Oakes'\r\nfirst citizens is indicated by the exceptional width of the streets.\r\n\r\nThe million dollar NORTH AMERICAN CREAMERY PLANT is the chief\r\nindustrial plant of the town.\r\n\r\nCENTRAL PARK, in the western part of town, contains a lighted\r\nice-skating rink.\r\n\r\nSouth of Oakes the low-lying hills of the Missouri Plateau (R) are\r\nvisible in the distance, while a range of hills (L) marks the Height of\r\nLand between the Sheyenne and James Rivers. Rain falling on the western\r\nside of these hills finds its way into the James and the Gulf of Mexico\r\nvia the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, while that falling to the E.\r\nenters the Sheyenne and eventually makes its way to Hudson Bay through\r\nthe Red River.\r\n\r\nLUDDEN, =69 m.= (1,303 alt., 164 pop.), was named by the town site\r\nowner, Frank Randall, for Mr. and Mrs. J. D. Ludden of St. Paul, Minn.,\r\nwho had cared for him when he was an infant. First settled nearby in\r\n1883, the town was moved in 1886 to its present site on the railway.\r\nThere are many Finns in the community who still use the _sauna_, or\r\nsteam bath, of their native land. Early marriage is common among them;\r\nthe Finnish tongue is usually spoken in the homes.\r\n\r\nAt =75 m.= the route crosses the South Dakota Line, 48 m. =NE.= of\r\nAberdeen, S. Dak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIDE TOUR 8B\r\n\r\n\r\n  Junction US 10--Cooperstown--Junction US 2. ND 1 & 7.\r\n\r\n  Junction with US 10 to junction with US 2, 93 m.\r\n\r\n  N. P. Ry. branch line roughly parallels route between US 10 and\r\n  Binford.\r\n\r\n  Graveled roadbed throughout.\r\n\r\n  Usual tourist accommodations in principal towns.\r\n\r\nThis route proceeds north over the smooth plain of the fertile\r\nblack-earth belt, through the hills of the upper Sheyenne River basin.\r\nFirst the Indians and later the metis or half-breeds hunted the large\r\nherds of buffalo that once roamed this lake-dotted region. Among the\r\nearliest white comers here were the Nicollet-Fremont exploratory\r\nexpedition in the 1830's, the Stevens survey party in 1853, the Sibley\r\nexpedition in 1863, and in the 1870's, the soldiers, scouts, and wagon\r\ntrains following the Fort Totten-Fort Abercrombie trail.\r\n\r\nBonanza farms flourished in this region during the last two decades of\r\nthe nineteenth century, but were subdivided eventually into smaller\r\nfarms taken up by Scandinavian immigrants who began to come here in the\r\n1880's. The first Norwegian community in North Dakota was established\r\nnear this route, and the fine farms of the present-day Norse residents\r\nare visible from the highway.\r\n\r\nND 1 branches N. from its junction with US 10, 5 m. W. of Valley City\r\n(_see Tour 8_).\r\n\r\nDAZEY, =22.5 m.= (1,428 alt., 251 pop.), was named for the father of\r\nCharles T. Dazey, author of the play _In Old Kentucky_. The elder Dazey\r\nowned the town site.\r\n\r\nRight from Dazey on ND 26, a graveled highway, to CAMP CORNING HISTORIC\r\nSITE, =8 m.=, where Sibley's expedition spent the night of July 16,\r\n1863. The camp was named for an officer on the Sibley staff.\r\n\r\nWALUM, =27.5 m.= (1,429 alt., 60 pop.), was named in 1900 for a\r\nprosperous landowner of this vicinity.\r\n\r\nHANNAFORD, =31 m.= (1,416 alt., 351 pop.), named for J. M. Hannaford,\r\none-time vice president of the N. P. Ry., lies W. of Bald Hill Creek,\r\ntributary of the Sheyenne River.\r\n\r\nAt =33 m.= is the junction with a dirt road.\r\n\r\nRight here =2 m.= to the junction with another dirt road; R. here to\r\nCAMP POPE, =2.3 m.=, made by members of the Sibley expedition in August\r\n1863 on their return to Minnesota after driving the Sioux W. of the\r\nMissouri River.\r\n\r\nAt =36 m.= the route crosses both the Sibley and the Fort Totten-Fort\r\nAbercrombie trails, although no traces of these routes are visible from\r\nthe highway. The Sibley expedition, in pursuit of the Sioux believed to\r\nbe responsible for the Minnesota Massacre (_see_ HISTORY), had learned\r\nthat the Indians were encamped near Devils Lake (_see Side Tour 6A_),\r\nso the long column of 4,000 men, 1,350 mules, 800 horses, and 225\r\nwagons set out in a northwesterly course toward the lake from Lisbon\r\n(_see Side Tour 8A_). Before they arrived, however, they learned that\r\ntheir quarry had gone to the Missouri, so they changed their course to\r\nthe W. The Sibley route toward Devils Lake was followed by the heavy\r\ntraffic between Fort Totten and Fort Abercrombie in the next decade.\r\n\r\nAt =41.5 m.= is the junction with ND 7, a graveled highway.\r\n\r\nRight here is COOPERSTOWN, =1 m.= (1,425 alt., 1,053 pop.). It was\r\nfounded in 1882 by T. J. and Rollin C. Cooper, brothers who, flush with\r\nthe profits of successful mining ventures in Colorado, arrived in this\r\nvicinity in 1880, and became bonanza farmers. They were instrumental\r\nin building the Sanborn, Cooperstown & Turtle Mountain R. R. (later an\r\nN. P. Ry. branch) into the town in 1883, and as terminal of this road\r\nCooperstown grew rapidly.\r\n\r\nAlthough old-fashioned, rambling houses set in spacious lawns and\r\nnumerous old buildings fronting the business streets create an\r\nunhurried atmosphere, Cooperstown has contributed several progressives\r\nto the national picture. Gerald P. Nye (1892-), U. S. Senator from\r\nNorth Dakota, chairman (1936) of the committee for investigation of\r\nthe munitions industry, was a weekly newspaper editor here when he\r\nwas appointed to a vacancy in the Senate in 1925. Former Congressman\r\nJames H. Sinclair (1871-), member of the Agricultural Committee\r\n(1925-1935), and coauthor of the Norris-Sinclair farm relief bill, was\r\nsuperintendent of the Cooperstown schools (1896-1898), and register of\r\ndeeds (1899-1905). Thomas R. Amlie (1897-), Wisconsin Congressman, and\r\nEdward D. Stair (1859-), publisher of the Detroit (Mich.) _Free Press_,\r\nare also former residents.\r\n\r\nStair established Cooperstown's first paper, the _Courier_, the year\r\nthe town was founded, and even before coming here had a hand in its\r\nhistory. He was feature writer for the Fargo _Argus_ and was also\r\nworking as a mail clerk on a railroad terminating in Hope at the time\r\nthat Cooperstown, then only a small settlement, decided to contest\r\nHope's right to the county seat. Stair learned that Hope was colonizing\r\nvoters with an eye to the coming county seat election, and exposed\r\nthe plan in a series of stories in the _Argus_. Hope residents were\r\nenraged, and warned him, if he wished to keep his skin unpunctured, to\r\nstay out of town, which was extremely difficult in view of the fact\r\nthat his train made a lay-over of several hours there. His fellow\r\nmail clerk, a six-foot newspaper man, came to his support, and the\r\ntwo, with six-shooters dangling from their hips, sauntered about Hope\r\nunmolested but hungry, for the only hotel in town refused to sell food\r\nto the enemy. Cooperstown won the election, but Hope refused to concede\r\nvictory, and it required two raids by Cooperstown residents to obtain\r\nthe county records for the new county seat.\r\n\r\nOn the Griggs County Courthouse grounds stands the _Opheim Log Cabin_,\r\nthe first permanent white home in the county. Built in 1879 by Omund\r\nNels Opheim on his claim NE. of Cooperstown, it was moved to its\r\npresent site to become a pioneer memorial, and contains the hand-made\r\nfurniture used by its former occupants.\r\n\r\nEast from Cooperstown on ND 7 to the junction with a dirt road, =3\r\nm.=; R. here to another junction, =7 m.=; R. on a prairie trail to a\r\ncircular group of five conical MOUNDS, =7.5 m.= From excavations made\r\nin similar mounds along the lower Sheyenne River (_see Side Tour 8A_)\r\narcheologists believe that most of these tumuli were built for burial\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nND 1 and 7 are identical between =41.5 m.= and =49.5 m.=, where ND\r\n1 proceeds R. to enter the rounded, lake-dotted hills of the DOVRE\r\nMORAINE, seventh ridge formed by debris deposited during the halts of\r\nthe retreating glaciers. The Nicollet-Fremont and Stevens expeditions,\r\nthe Sibley column, and both a gold seekers' caravan and an immigrant\r\ntrain guided by Capt. James Fisk crossed this moraine at various times,\r\ncamping on some of the lakes.\r\n\r\nAt =55 m.= is the junction with a prairie trail. At this junction\r\nis (R) CAMP ATCHESON HISTORIC SITE, commemorating establishment of\r\nSibley's base camp July 18, 1863.\r\n\r\nLeft on the prairie trail to LAKE SIBLEY, =0.5 m.=, a small morainic\r\nlake on the northeastern shore of which is the actual _Site of Camp\r\nAtcheson_. The camp was named for Capt. Charles Atcheson of Sibley's\r\nstaff. When General Sibley heard from friendly Chippewa Indians that\r\nthe Sioux he was pursuing were fleeing from the Devils Lake region\r\ntoward the Missouri River, he hastily ordered trenches dug and\r\nbreastworks thrown up, and inside this fortification placed all his\r\nsick men, weak horses, the baggage train, the cattle, and the surplus\r\nof supply wagons. Leaving two companies of infantry to maintain the\r\ncamp he started after the Sioux. The main column, traveling light,\r\nsucceeded in driving them across the Missouri near Bismarck, and\r\nreturned to the base camp a month later. On a hill overlooking the lake\r\nfrom the NE. a marble marker denotes the grave of a private who died\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nAt 57 =m.= is the junction with an unimproved dirt road.\r\n\r\nRight here to LAKE JESSIE, =2.3 m.=, where the bed of a once\r\nmirror-like body of water now blows with alkali dust. In the early\r\n1900's 12 ft. of water covered the lake bed, but in 1933 motorcycle\r\nraces were run here. A heavy growth of timber, which has survived\r\nthe lake, and a fine spring at its west end made it a landmark for\r\nexplorers of the region. Nicollet and Fremont camped here in 1839, and\r\nFremont named the lake for his fiancee, Jessie Benton. In 1853 Gov. I.\r\nI. Stevens, guided by Pierre Bottineau (_see_ HISTORY), camped on the\r\nlake on his way to become Governor of Washington Territory. In 1862\r\nCapt. James Fisk, guiding a party of gold seekers to the fields in\r\nMontana and Utah, camped on Lake Jessie, and again in 1863 stopped at\r\nthe lake several days with an immigrant train he led through the State.\r\nThe second Fisk expedition and the Sibley column, on Lake Sibley, were\r\nbut a few miles apart, and the two camps exchanged visits.\r\n\r\nBINFORD, =57.5 m.= (1,518 alt., 317 pop.), was named for Ray Binford,\r\nattorney for the D. B. S. Johnston Land Co., which purchased and\r\nplatted the town site. The company bought the homestead of Gilbert\r\nGilbertson, an early settler. The many names used by Gilbertson\r\nillustrate the common Norwegian practice of changing the surname on\r\narrival in this country, sometimes using the name of the father with\r\n\"son\" affixed, and sometimes adopting the title of the home district\r\nas surname. To add to this, Americans thought these names too long or\r\nforeign to be practical, and changed them for the newcomers. Gilbertson\r\nfiled on his homestead as Gilbert Gilbertson, but was equally well\r\nknown in his community as Gabriel Gabrielson, Gilbert Gabrielson, and\r\nGabriel Gilbertson.\r\n\r\nLeft (NW) from Binford on a graveled road is MOSE, =6 m.= (1,539 alt.,\r\n30 pop.). Here are the ANSONIA KENNELS, which raise white German\r\nshepherds. This is a remnant of an industry that reached its peak in\r\nGriggs County in 1924 when the Nation-wide fad for German police dogs\r\nwas at its height. In that year as many as 400 farmers were breeding\r\ndogs in the county, and animals totaling a value of more than $100,000\r\nwere shipped to all parts of the United States, to South America, and\r\nto the Philippine Islands. The industry had its beginning in 1914 near\r\nCooperstown when farmer Torkel Njaa imported a German shepherd for a\r\nwatchdog. Njaa was so pleased with the animal that he imported two\r\nfemales. His success in raising and marketing dogs caught the fancy of\r\nother farmers, and led to the establishment of the industry.\r\n\r\nAt =63.5 m.= is the junction with a graveled spur.\r\n\r\nLeft here to RED WILLOW LAKE, =2 m.= On the southern shore is a TOURIST\r\nPARK (_cabins_, _boats_, _swimming_, _camping_, _fishing_), part of a\r\n1,300-acre State game refuge. A pavilion (_seating capacity 1,500_)\r\nserves for recreational purposes and is the scene of many conventions,\r\nincluding an annual Lutheran Bible Camp (_June_).\r\n\r\nND 1 crosses the wooded SHEYENNE RIVER at =69.5 m.= and at =82.5 m.=\r\nskirts the eastern end of STUMP LAKE, a body of water that once covered\r\napproximately 10,000 acres, but is now reduced to slightly more than\r\n2,000. The Sioux called the lake Wamduska (_serpent_), and believed it\r\nwas once a great forest which the Great Spirit, in anger, allowed to be\r\nswallowed by water. On clear days logs can be seen below the surface,\r\nand where the water has receded many large stumps protrude from the\r\nground, giving the lake bed the appearance of a timbered area logged\r\noff by beavers. Geologists believe that Stump Lake was once connected\r\nwith Devils Lake, 10 m. W., and had an outlet into the Sheyenne River.\r\nThe wooded area along the eastern shore has been transformed into\r\na recreational park, and BIRD ISLAND, a 350-acre peninsula in the\r\nsouthwestern bay of the lake, has been set aside as a U. S. Biological\r\nSurvey game reserve.\r\n\r\nAt =87 m.= is the junction with a graveled road.\r\n\r\nLeft on this road to the junction with an unimproved road at =2 m.=;\r\nR. here to WAMDUSKA HOTEL, =2.5 m.=, a lonely 75-room building that is\r\na silent reminder of the village of Wamduska, platted, peopled, and\r\nabandoned because of a railroad survey. The town was founded in the\r\n1880's when it was believed that the G. N. Ry. would be constructed\r\nalong Lake Wamduska, as it was then called, but the survey was made 10\r\nm. to the N., and Wamduska died. Today the old hotel is used as a farm\r\nstorehouse.\r\n\r\nAt =93 m.= is the junction with US 2 (_see Tour 6_) 1 m. E. of Lakota\r\n(_see Tour 6_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIDE TOUR 8C\r\n\r\n\r\n  Mandan--Cannonball--Fort Yates--South Dakota Line. ND 6, 21, & 24.\r\n\r\n  Mandan to South Dakota Line, 85 m.\r\n\r\n  Graveled roadbed except 15 m. unimproved dry-weather roadbed on ND\r\n  21.\r\n\r\n  Accommodations at Fort Yates only.\r\n\r\nThis route traverses the North Dakota section of the Standing Rock\r\nIndian Agency (_for history of the agency see_ INDIANS AND THEIR\r\nPREDECESSORS) where Sitting Bull, Rain-in-the-Face, and Chief Gall,\r\nFather Pierre De Smet, and Maj. James McLaughlin made early history\r\nin the Dakotas. When organized in 1868 the reservation contained four\r\nmillion acres. The treaty with the Sioux in 1887, however, provided\r\nfor white settlement, and when the area was opened for homesteading in\r\n1910 the reservation was reduced to 1,343,000 acres. Today all of Sioux\r\nCounty constitutes the North Dakota portion of the agency. Here 1,600\r\nmembers of the upper and lower bands of the Yanktonai Sioux make their\r\nhomes in an area of rugged brown hills, smooth grasslands, and rugged,\r\ndistorted, gray-blue buttes. On the South Dakota side of the agency\r\nlive 1,100 Hunkpapa and Blackfoot Sioux.\r\n\r\nND 6 branches S. from its junction with US 10 at MANDAN (_see Tour 8_),\r\ncrosses the Heart River, and passes the U. S. NORTHERN GREAT PLAINS\r\nFIELD STATION (_guides available at office_). At =4 m.= is the U. S.\r\nNORTHERN GREAT PLAINS DAIRY STATION (R). Various crops, plants, trees,\r\nshrubs, methods of farming, breeds of cattle, and even buildings are\r\ntried, tested, and adapted to the dry farming of the Missouri Slope\r\ncountry at these two Government experimental stations.\r\n\r\nAs the highway gradually ascends from the river valley to the flowing\r\nprairies, high hills and buttes are outlined in a blue haze against the\r\nsouthwestern horizon. At =9 m.= (R) is the CESKY ZAKOPNIK (pronounced\r\n_Chesky za kop' neek_) or retreat of the Western Czechoslovakian\r\nFraternal Organization, a social, benevolent, and protective society.\r\nThe Cesky Zakopnik is a lodge hall and social center for the Czechs\r\nof Mandan and the vicinity. These people are thoroughly Americanized.\r\nTheir dances (_public_), quite American in all other respects, have one\r\nunusual feature, the dancing of Sala Naninka De Zeli (_Annie Went to\r\nthe Cabbage Patch_), a folk dance with intricate steps. It is usually\r\nperformed once or twice during the evening, and the older people\r\nparticularly enjoy it.\r\n\r\nThe sharp, high-pointed peak (L) of LITTLE HEART BUTTE (Sioux name,\r\nTa canta wakpa cikala paha), an early-day landmark, is visible from\r\na distance before the road passes it at =11 m.= The Bismarck Weather\r\nBureau uses the peak several times daily for observations of visibility.\r\n\r\nAt =15 m.= is the junction with a graveled road.\r\n\r\nRight here is ST. ANTHONY, =0.5 m.= (1,790 alt., 116 pop.), a small\r\ncommunity settled in 1887 by Roman Catholic German-Hungarians from\r\nOhio. In 1906 a parochial school was opened, and despite the small\r\nsize of the community this institution is still in operation, with an\r\nenrollment of more than 120.\r\n\r\nThe highway enters range country with few fences or farms. At =26 m.=\r\nis a junction with ND 21 (=see Side Tour 4B=), which unites with ND 6\r\nto =33 m.= Here, as the highway begins to descend into the valley of\r\nthe Cannonball River, there is a far-reaching view of country severe\r\nand imposing. Steep grass-covered hills and mesas give way to sharp,\r\nabrupt, gray clay cones and buttes that rise in confusion from the\r\nplain. The work of erosion in the creation of these formations is\r\nvisible in many sidehills, where the top layers of earth have worn away\r\nto expose the bedrock strata beneath.\r\n\r\nAt =32 m.= is the junction with a graveled roadbed.\r\n\r\nRight here is BREIEN, =1 m.= (1,694 alt., 53 pop.). Between the highway\r\nand the town is a natural park with camping facilities.\r\n\r\nThe CANNONBALL RIVER is crossed at =32.5 m.= The river, its thin fringe\r\nof trees contrasting with the gray-brown of the valley, is so named\r\nbecause of the odd spheroidal formations found in its waters and in the\r\nsteep banks of its valley. These concretions, believed to have been\r\nformed by the action of moisture within the Fox Hills sandstone, have\r\nbeen carried away in such large numbers by collectors that today only\r\nthe small \"cannonballs\" are found along the stream. The Cannonball was\r\nthe northern boundary of the Standing Rock Reservation before the area\r\nwas opened to white settlement in 1910, and now is the northern limit\r\nof jurisdiction of the agency.\r\n\r\nLeft at =33 m.= on ND 21, an unimproved dry-weather roadbed; the route\r\npasses through rugged hills S. of the Cannonball, reaching SOLEN, =40\r\nm.= (1,671 alt., 103 pop.), on the riverbank.\r\n\r\nThe route continues through country occasionally dotted with the small\r\nframe buildings of white farmers and the log huts of Indian families.\r\n\r\nAt =49 m.= is the junction with ND 24, a graveled highway; R. on this\r\nroute.\r\n\r\nLeft from the junction with ND 24 on ND 21 to the junction with an\r\nunimproved road, =1 m.=; straight ahead (N) =0.3 m.= to the steep\r\nwestern slope of the HOLY HILL OF THE MANDANS (R). Almost every tribe\r\nof American Indians has a tradition of a great flood which covered\r\nall the earth. The Mandan legend tells that an ark came to rest on\r\nthis hill near the Cannonball River, and after the waters subsided the\r\nFirst Man and First Woman stepped out on the hill. Mandan, Arikara, and\r\nSioux all revere the place, and the older natives are reticent about\r\napproaching the hilltop.\r\n\r\nWhile the hill is steep on its western slope, it rolls gently into the\r\nsurrounding terrain to the E. Clustered at its top are four granite\r\nboulders. Carved into the face of the largest, a red stone, are many\r\nsymbols: buffalo tracks, bear paws, thunderbird tracks, serpents, and\r\nturtles. The three smaller gray rocks also carry one or two symbols\r\neach. Through legend and story the existence of these writing rocks\r\nhad been indicated for many years, but, because of Indian reticence\r\nregarding sacred objects, their exact location was not definitely\r\nestablished until early in 1937. For clearness and number of carvings\r\nthey compare with the Grenora Writing Rock (_see Side Tour 4A_).\r\n\r\nOn ND 21 at =4 m.= is CANNONBALL (1,607 alt., 110 pop.), on the slope\r\nabove the first bench of the MISSOURI RIVER. This is a good place\r\nto observe the Sioux in his native surroundings. During the winter\r\nmonths he lives in a tiny log hut, clay-chinked and sod-roofed, heated\r\nwith a crude open hearth or a modern heating stove, depending on his\r\naffluence. In the summer he takes to the cooler tents or brush wikiups.\r\nSioux beadwork and other articles of handicraft can be purchased in the\r\nstores at reasonable prices. Many of the Sioux here are well educated\r\nand will talk freely with strangers on current issues, but they are\r\ndecidedly reserved concerning information and legends of their people.\r\nThis is, of course, typical of the entire agency; the Indian will\r\npretend ignorance of the identity or whereabouts of any Indian about\r\nwhom a white man may inquire, unless the white man is known to him.\r\n\r\nThe first Sioux sun dance in North Dakota in more than 50 years was\r\nheld near Cannonball in July 1937.\r\n\r\nNearly opposite the mouth of the Cannonball on the eastern bank of the\r\nMissouri, according to legend, once stood a Sioux village where in\r\nearly days a holy man prophesied the coming of the white people. This\r\nholy man saw a vision which made him very sad, but try as he would, he\r\ncould not banish it or change it. Urged by his people to reveal what\r\nhe saw, he told that a strange race of people was relentlessly moving\r\nwestward toward them, and would eventually claim their lands. He said\r\nthese people had pale, hideous, ghastly skins, and their men had hairy\r\nfaces like wolves. They had powerful weapons also, and the red men\r\nwould not be able to withstand them when they came.\r\n\r\nRight from Cannonball =13 m.= on a graded dry-weather dirt road to an\r\nabandoned railroad bed, built when the N. P. Ry. planned a line to\r\nPierre, S. Dak. Atop the old bed runs a trail through country teeming\r\nwith upland game (_during open season excellent pheasant, chicken, and\r\ngrouse hunting_). The trail turns R. at =20 m.= and reaches ND 24 at\r\n=22 m.=\r\n\r\nSouth of Cannonball Corner the route proceeds on ND 24 to the junction\r\nwith a graveled road at =69 m.=\r\n\r\nRight on this road at =0.5 m.= are the SIOUX COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS where\r\nan annual Indian fair is held (_1st wk. Sept._). Handiwork and produce\r\nare displayed, and bead, quill, and feather work can be purchased\r\nreasonably. A rodeo is usually a feature of the fair, with both white\r\nand Indian riders participating. Each evening there is dancing in\r\ncostume, beginning with the true Indian dances and ending with the\r\n_kahomni_, or half-breed dances. There are also contests for the most\r\nskillful dancers.\r\n\r\nAt =0.7 m.= is the unkept GRAVE OF SITTING BULL, covered with a\r\nconcrete slab. This great Sioux chief was killed by Indian police on\r\nthe Grand River in South Dakota during the Messiah trouble in 1890.\r\nSitting Bull had long championed his people against the invasions of\r\nthe white men, and was one of the leaders in the Battle of the Little\r\nBig Horn. After the battle Sitting Bull, Chief Gall, and 300 followers,\r\npursued by Gen. Nelson A. Miles, took refuge in Canada where they\r\nremained until 1881. Gall returned first, resigned himself to the ways\r\nof the white man, and lived out his life on the reservation. He is\r\nburied at Wakpala, S. Dak. A few months after Gall's surrender Sitting\r\nBull appeared at Fort Buford (_see Side Tour 6B_) followed by the\r\ntattered and hungry remnants of his faithful band, and gave himself up\r\nto the authorities. Although he never completely capitulated to the\r\ndesires of his conquerors, he returned to the reservation and lived\r\nquietly there, except for a year he spent in Buffalo Bill's Wild West\r\nShow. In 1890, however, the Messiah craze arose. The Indians had been\r\ntold a new Messiah was coming to restore their lands to them. They held\r\nghost dances and planned for the repossession of their lands as soon\r\nas the Messiah appeared. To forestall the possibility of an uprising\r\nthe Indian police were sent to arrest Sitting Bull, who was believed\r\nto be a leader of the movement. In the half-light of a December early\r\nmorning they entered his home and took him into custody. His followers\r\nwere aroused and a battle ensued. At the first move from Sitting Bull's\r\nmen the police shot him, and he fell, mortally wounded. Several of the\r\npolice were also slain.\r\n\r\nThe bodies of the dead were taken to Fort Yates for burial, the Indian\r\npolice being buried in the Roman Catholic cemetery where today a\r\nmonument marks their resting places. In contrast with the elaborate\r\nrites which attended the burial of the slain policemen, Sitting Bull's\r\nbody was interred without ceremony in the military cemetery. Fort\r\nYates was abandoned in 1895 and all military graves removed. Only the\r\nburial place of the famous Sioux leader was left.\r\n\r\nFORT YATES, =1 m.= (1,670 alt., 700 pop.), is INDIAN AGENCY\r\nHEADQUARTERS, and seat of Sioux County. A few soldiers were stationed\r\nat the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in 1873, but with the\r\nabandonment of Fort Rice in 1877 Fort Yates was established to protect\r\nthe western frontier. It was named for Capt. George Yates of the\r\nSeventh Cavalry who was killed in the Battle of the Little Big Horn.\r\n\r\nThe superiority of railway transportation to that of the river boat led\r\nto the abandonment of Fort Yates in 1895 and the establishment of the\r\nnew Fort Lincoln at Bismarck (_see Tour 8_).\r\n\r\nIt was at the Standing Rock Reservation that Rain-in-the-Face, a young\r\nHunkpapa Sioux, was arrested by Tom Custer, brother of Gen. George A.\r\nCuster, for the alleged slaying of two white men. Rain-in-the-Face was\r\nimprisoned at Fort Abraham Lincoln but made his escape and joined the\r\nband of Sitting Bull, who lived without benefit of agency. He gained\r\nhis revenge by participating in the Battle of the Little Big Horn.\r\n\r\nThe town today retains much of the appearance and spirit of its\r\nfrontier days when it played an important part in the early Indian\r\nhistory of the State. On a flat plain overlooking the Missouri, its\r\nlog huts and contrasting white frame buildings are scattered in a lazy\r\nfashion over a wide area, with the agency offices, schools, and the\r\nhospital as the core of the town.\r\n\r\nAcross the street from the agency office, overlooking the Missouri,\r\nis the famed STANDING ROCK (Sioux, Inyan Woslata), for which the\r\nagency was named. Originally sacred to the Arikara, it came into the\r\npossession of the Sioux. When the reservation was established the rock\r\nwas on Proposal Hill, but it was later brought into town and mounted\r\non a brick pedestal. It is of gray metamorphic composition entirely\r\nforeign to this area. If viewed from the correct angle, and with a\r\ndiscreet degree of imagination, the stone resembles the seated figure\r\nof a small, shawled woman. According to Dakota legend, a young Indian\r\nwoman became jealous of her husband's second wife and refused to leave\r\ncamp when the village moved. Thinking she would soon follow, the people\r\nof the village left her sitting before the fire with her child on her\r\nback. When she did not appear her husband sent his brothers-in-law to\r\nlook for her. They returned to the deserted camp and found her and the\r\nchild still seated before the fire--both transformed into stone. From\r\nthat time the rock was carried with the tribe and occupied a position\r\nin the center of each village in which they lived. This rock is one of\r\ntwo revered by the Sioux. The other, Inyan Bosdata (_erect rock_), is\r\non the Sheyenne River (_see Side Tour 8A_).\r\n\r\nThe population of Fort Yates is both white and Indian. The two great\r\nevents of the year are the annual fair (_see above_), and the Fourth\r\nof July, when Indians from miles around come in to celebrate. On these\r\noccasions the fairgrounds present an unusual sight. Tall, graceful\r\ntipis rise above the squat, modern wall tents of the numerous camps\r\nthat dot the level area around the race track, and back and forth is\r\na bustling flow of dilapidated autos, sleek saddle ponies, running\r\nchildren, hobbling old warriors, and women dressed in bright colors.\r\nExcept for their braided hair and their moccasins, the older men wear\r\nmodern attire. The younger men, in keeping with the occasion, adopt\r\nwestern costume, high-heeled riding boots, blue denim trousers topped\r\nwith wide, flashy belts, brightly colored shirts, and the ever present\r\n\"ten gallon\" hat. Cotton dresses and large bright shawls form the\r\ncostume of the women, and moccasins are also worn by the older women.\r\nThe highly colored Sioux costumes are seen only during the native\r\ndances.\r\n\r\nMemorial Day and Armistice Day are also holidays. On Memorial Day\r\ngraves are decorated with crepe paper flowers which have been made by\r\nthe women during the winter. The Indians are intensely patriotic, and\r\nit would be hard to find a fair, tribal council, or any other meeting\r\nover which the flag of the United States does not fly.\r\n\r\nA trail runs NW. of the town past the Roman Catholic church to a GOLF\r\nCOURSE, all nine holes laid out on the mesa-like top of Proposal Hill,\r\nwhere Standing Rock once stood. The hill in bygone days was a popular\r\nrendezvous for Indian sweethearts, hence its name.\r\n\r\nAcross the river from Fort Yates, in the heyday of the military post,\r\nthere sprang up a little town called WINONA, a natural corollary of the\r\nrestrictions of military life on an Indian reservation. By ferryboat in\r\nsummer and over the ice by bobsled in winter went the soldier, trader,\r\nbullwhacker, Indian, and cowboy, to taste the \"night life\" offered in\r\nthe gaming houses with their expansive bars and amiable hostesses.\r\nIn Territorial days no less than nine saloons were operating, and an\r\nexcellent race track was the scene of many financial exchanges.\r\n\r\nLike other western towns, Winona attracted a wide variety of\r\ninhabitants. One of the most colorful was \"Mustache Maude\" Black. She\r\ncame to the vicinity as a young school teacher, but, finding a more\r\nlucrative scope for her talents, entered the entertainment field. Tall,\r\nlarge, and angular, she was masculine in appearance, but wore women's\r\nclothing with the exception of her boots, which she had made to order,\r\nreputedly at $20 a pair. Because of her occupation the women of Winona\r\nostracized her, but the men found her well educated, an astute business\r\nwoman, a good poker player, and an excellent cook. By one of those\r\nquirks which make human beings as interesting as they are, Mustache\r\nMaude, the proprietor of many of Winona's most scarlet institutions,\r\nowned a good library and was an expert needlewoman. She married Ott\r\nBlack, a rancher, and after the decline of her own business interests\r\nmanaged his ranch. She lived near Winona until her death.\r\n\r\nThere was another side of life in Winona, too. It was an enterprising\r\nbusiness town, in the center of a growing ranching country. A Literary\r\nSociety and Dramatic Club functioned for years. The Sunday school\r\nwas organized by Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Spicer, who in 1897, together\r\nwith four other members of their family, were killed by five drunken\r\nIndians, three of whom were subsequently lynched for the crime at\r\nnearby Williamsport.\r\n\r\nWinona was so close to Fort Yates that at the time of the death of\r\nSitting Bull and the Indian policemen the wailing of the squaws was\r\nclearly heard across the river. After the abandonment of Fort Yates,\r\nWinona began to decline. Today nothing is left of it but a few cellars\r\nand a solitary group of trees.\r\n\r\nThe route proceeds S. on ND 24, continuing through agency land. At =79\r\nm.= is the junction with ND 6; left here to South Dakota Line at =85\r\nm.=, 8 m. N. of McLaughlin, S. Dak. (_see S. Dak. Tour 2_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIDE TOUR 8D\r\n\r\n\r\n  Junction US 10--Center--Beulah--Halliday--Killdeer--Junction US 85.\r\n  ND 25.\r\n\r\n  Junction with US 10 to junction with US 85, 141.5 m.\r\n\r\n  N. P. Ry. branch roughly parallels route between Stanton and\r\n  Killdeer.\r\n\r\n  Graveled roadbed except 4 m. graded dirt.\r\n\r\n  Accommodations limited.\r\n\r\nThis route winds over the upper Missouri Slope, through grain-farming\r\nand grazing country, where infrequent farmhouses hide in the valleys.\r\nWhen ranching was the chief industry here, not long ago, the rough\r\ncountry provided shelter not only for the herds but also for rustlers.\r\nIn the region adjacent to the route are some of the largest lignite\r\nmines in the State. Along the Missouri are numerous ancient Indian\r\nvillage sites. The Killdeer Mountains at the northern end of the route\r\npresent some of the most charming scenery in North Dakota.\r\n\r\nND 25 branches N. from US 10 (_see Tour 8_) 5 m. W. of Mandan.\r\n\r\nAt =12.5 m.= the highway crosses SQUARE BUTTE CREEK, named for the\r\nsquare-topped buttes to the E. (_see Side Tour 3B_). The stream\r\nparallels the route for several miles.\r\n\r\nCENTER, =30.5 m.= (1,760 alt., 293 pop.), was named for its geographic\r\nposition in Oliver County. Its buildings, almost all of them white,\r\nare huddled in the narrow valley of Square Butte Creek. In the Oliver\r\nCounty Courthouse park is a LOG CABIN MUSEUM (_open_) erected in 1937\r\nunder the Works Progress Administration to house Indian and pioneer\r\nrelics. Nearby is the MINER MEMORIAL, a granite marker of Gothic style,\r\nerected by former Gov. L. B. Hanna, in commemoration of 16-year-old\r\nHazel Miner. In 1920 Hazel and a younger brother and sister were lost\r\nin a raging March blizzard while driving home from school. When they\r\nwere found the next morning, the two younger children were still alive,\r\nfor Hazel had used her body to shield them and to hold down the\r\nblankets which kept them from freezing. The story of her life and death\r\nhas been made part of the official records of the county.\r\n\r\nNorth of Center the route encounters rougher country and turns NW. to\r\nfollow the MISSOURI RIVER for a few miles.\r\n\r\nAt =40.5 m.= is the junction with an unimproved county dirt road.\r\n\r\nRight on this road to the junction with another unimproved road, =1\r\nm.=; L. here to FORT CLARK STATE PARK, =2 m.=, site of a trading post\r\nestablished by the American Fur Co. in 1829. The post was only a\r\nfew feet S. of a village built by the Mandans about 1822, and later\r\noccupied by the Arikara. West of the depressions left by the earth\r\nlodges are the remains of a burial ground.\r\n\r\nAt =46 m.= is the junction with a graveled road.\r\n\r\nRight on this road is STANTON, =1.5 m.= (1,722 alt., 358 pop.), on the\r\nfirst bench overlooking the Missouri, which it once served as a river\r\nport. The town was founded in 1883 and given the name of a pioneer\r\nmother of the vicinity. Partly within the Mercer County Courthouse yard\r\nis the site of an INDIAN VILLAGE where excavations have revealed many\r\nartifacts.\r\n\r\nStraight ahead from Stanton on a county road to the SITE OF SCATTERED\r\nVILLAGE, =2.5 m.=, one of the three Hidatsa and two Mandan villages\r\nknown to white traders and trappers as the Five Villages. Charbonneau,\r\nthe French frontiersman, and his Shoshone wife, Sakakawea, were living\r\nhere when Charbonneau was engaged by the exploring party of Lewis and\r\nClark, in 1805, to accompany them on their hazardous journey to the\r\nPacific coast. Sakakawea went with her husband, and proved herself\r\ninvaluable to the success of the expedition (_see_ BISMARCK). Scattered\r\nVillage lies on the southern bank of the KNIFE RIVER, which was named\r\nby various Indian tribes who procured flint for their knives from pits\r\nalong the river. The area about the mouth of the Knife is rich in\r\nIndian history.\r\n\r\nWest of Stanton the route moves roughly parallel to the combined\r\ncourses of the Knife River and Spring Creek.\r\n\r\nHAZEN, =58.5 m.= (1,760 alt., 689 pop.), was named for A. D. Hazen,\r\nThird Assistant Postmaster General in 1884 when postal service was\r\nestablished here. An OLD SETTLERS MONUMENT, at the E. end of Main St.\r\nin a triangular plot known as Washington Memorial Park, consists of a\r\nconcrete pyramid with a buffalo skull embedded in the top. Business\r\nmen of Hazen have provided a TOURIST PARK (_camping facilities_) in a\r\nheavily wooded area along the Knife on the southern edge of the town.\r\n\r\nAt =66 m.= (L) is the large underground LIGNITE MINE of the Knife River\r\nCoal Mining Co. (_Morning preferred for visiting; guides at mine office\r\nin_ BEULAH, _see below_.) This mine is one of the largest in the State.\r\nThe entrance is at the head of a little valley a few rods L. of the\r\nhighway. It opens into a long tunnel, with a narrow-gage trolley line\r\nextending down its center. Six electric locomotives are employed to\r\ndraw a fleet of 450 mine cars over almost 30 m. of track which carry\r\ncoal out of the mine to the processing plant. The entry has passages\r\nbranching from it, leading to the veins from which the coal is taken.\r\nAs the coal is taken out, tunnels or rooms are created, extending for\r\nmiles through the underground darkness, in some places as much as 140\r\nft. below the surface.\r\n\r\nThe coal is loosened by electric cutting machines and blasting powder,\r\nafter which loading machines carry it upward to the mine cars; these\r\nare formed into trains to haul the lignite to the processing plant.\r\n\r\nDuring an 8-hour shift 2,500 tons of coal are mined, enough to fill\r\nmore than 60 40-ton cars. It is estimated that this particular field\r\ncontains about 50,000,000 tons of lignite, enough to enable operations\r\nto continue for 50 years. Visitors to the mine are given electric\r\nlights fastened to stout fiber helmets, and get a novel ride on the\r\nunderground train.\r\n\r\nBEULAH, =68.5 m.= (1,797 alt., 913 pop.), named for the niece of an\r\nofficial of the town site land company, forms one main street along\r\nthe Knife River just E. of its confluence with Spring Creek. The\r\nPROCESSING PLANT of the Knife River mine, and an ELECTRIC PLANT of the\r\nNorth Dakota Power and Light Co. are in the eastern part of town. The\r\nelectric plant uses lignite to generate the power with which it serves\r\nsurrounding towns.\r\n\r\nAt =69 m.= is the junction with ND 49, a graveled highway. What is\r\nbelieved to be the SITE OF CHARLES LE RAYE'S CAMP (L), used by the\r\nFrench explorer in 1803, has been marked by the Mercer County Old\r\nSettlers' Association. Le Raye, who was held captive three years\r\n(1801-4) by a band of Brulé Sioux, is said to have been the first white\r\ntraveler to mention the Knife River. During his captivity he was taken\r\nthrough much of the area between the Mississippi and the Rockies, and\r\nwas one of the first white men to become familiar with that region.\r\n\r\nAt =75 m.= (L) is the large lignite strip mine of the Zap Colliery, one\r\nof the heaviest-producing mines in the State, with an annual production\r\nof 140,000 tons.\r\n\r\nAt =76.5 m.= is the junction with a county graded dirt road.\r\n\r\nLeft on this road, a winding country trail unsuited to trailer travel,\r\nto MEDICINE HILL, =11.5 m.=, from which flowed spring waters attributed\r\nwith healing powers by the Indians. Chert, a mineral rock closely\r\nallied to flint, is found in the Slope area, and near the hill is a\r\nquarry from which natives took material for arrow-points and knives.\r\n\r\nGOLDEN VALLEY, =83.5 m.= (1,946 alt., 294 pop.), was named for the\r\nfertility of the surrounding region.\r\n\r\nDODGE, =91 m.= (1,979 alt., 204 pop.), is in the valley of Spring\r\nCreek.\r\n\r\nAt =97 m.= is a junction with ND 8 which unites with ND 25 to =99 m.=,\r\nwhere ND 25 branches L.\r\n\r\nRight on ND 8 at the confluence of Alkaline and Spring Creek is\r\nHALLIDAY, =0.5 m.= (2,048 alt., 305 pop.), named for one of its first\r\nsettlers.\r\n\r\nAt =19 m.= is FOUR BEARS BRIDGE (_see Side Tour 3A_)\r\n\r\nDUNN CENTER, =113 m.= (2,191 alt., 276 pop.), is so named because it is\r\nnear the geographic center of Dunn County.\r\n\r\nAt =120 m.= is the junction with ND 22, a graded dirt highway.\r\n\r\nRight on this highway is KILLDEER, =1 m.= (2,233 alt., 495 pop.),\r\nnamed for the nearby KILLDEER MOUNTAINS, which rise clearly into view\r\nas ND 22 proceeds NW. from the town. The Killdeers are not mountains,\r\nbut rather two lofty hills, extending NE. to SW. more than 10 m., and\r\nat their highest points rising 600 ft. above the surrounding prairie.\r\nThe Sioux called them Tah-kah-o-kuty (_the place where they kill the\r\ndeer_). The upper 300 to 400 ft. of the hills belong to the geologic\r\nstratum known as the White River formation. This is the youngest of\r\nthe various layers of bedrock underlying North Dakota, having been\r\ndeposited by the last of the prehistoric seas which inundated this\r\narea. It is also the rarest stratum in the State, since, being at the\r\nsurface, it has eroded until it is now found in only a few places.\r\nThe White River formation is particularly rich in fossil remains\r\nranging from fish and turtles to huge prehistoric mammals, although no\r\nspecimens have been taken from the Killdeer Mountains.\r\n\r\nAt =4 m.= to the junction with an unimproved county road; L. here to\r\nthe junction with another dirt road, =7 m.=\r\n\r\nDirectly ahead =2 m.= on the dirt road to the junction with a prairie\r\ntrail leading through a pasture gate. Right on this trail are the\r\nbuildings of DIAMOND C RANCH, =4 m.=, the little white ranch house, the\r\nred cattle barns, and the gray weathered wooden poles of the corrals\r\nall situated along the timbered ravine formed by FALLING SPRING, near\r\nwhich took place the Battle of Killdeer Mountains. The spring drops\r\nfrom a sandstone formation in a hillside to the rear of the ranch\r\nhouse, providing a steady flow of cool, clear water as it did one\r\nJuly day in 1864 when 5,000 Sioux were encamped along it, hunting\r\nand preparing hides for clothing and food for the coming winter.\r\nGen. Alfred H. Sully, sent out to punish the Sioux for the Minnesota\r\nMassacre of 1862, learned that they were in the mountains. Rapidly\r\nmoving his force of 2,200 men he attacked the Indians on sight the\r\nmorning of July 28. The Indians offered stubborn resistance despite\r\nthe surprise of the attack and the confusion caused by the shelling\r\nof their camp, but were finally forced to make a hasty retreat over\r\nthe mountain through DEAD MAN'S GULCH, a steep-sided ravine leading\r\nthrough the mountains back of Falling Spring, into the Badlands along\r\nthe Little Missouri River. In their retreat the Sioux were forced\r\nto leave almost all of their belongings, and when 5 companies of\r\ntroops set about demolishing the camp it is said they worked 5 hours\r\ndestroying tipis, travois poles, cooking utensils, robes, and foods.\r\nDried and drying meat estimated at 200 tons was destroyed. The Sioux\r\nloss was reported as 27 dead on the field in addition to many carried\r\noff by their comrades. Sully's loss in the encounter was 5 killed and\r\n10 wounded, 2 of whom were pickets slain the second night. Two white\r\nmarble slabs enclosed in a steel wire fence, a short distance S. of the\r\nDiamond C ranch house, mark their graves.\r\n\r\nOn the county road N. of junction with ranch road to a junction with\r\na dirt road, =9 m.=; L. here to OAKDALE, =9.8 m.=, part way up the\r\neastern slope of the southern mountain. Formerly a good-sized frontier\r\ntown, it now has only a residence and a store and post office. It is a\r\nvery pleasant spot, however, for its trees and many springs of clear,\r\ncold water flowing down from the mountain keep it several degrees\r\ncooler in summer than the dry, shadeless prairie. Oakdale is a good\r\npoint from which to make hiking trips into the mountains, but the\r\ntourist accommodations are limited.\r\n\r\nFrom the store is a two-hour hike over a precipitous trail up the\r\nmountain. Past oak, box elder, poplar, and scrub cedar trees, the path\r\nleads to the base of the limestone formation. Here the trail ascends\r\nthe face of a steep cliff. In the upward climb it passes through a\r\nnarrow cleft in the rock ironically called ELEPHANT'S PASS, and comes\r\nat last to the level mountaintop, where there is a magnificent view\r\nof the surrounding country taking in 40 or 50 m. in three directions.\r\nTo the N. and NE. lies the rough country along the Missouri and\r\nLittle Missouri Rivers, while E. and S. stretches the vast pattern of\r\ncultivated fields and virgin grasslands. The table-like top of the\r\nmountain is 3,140 ft. above sea level, highest elevation in the range.\r\nFrom here the trail skirts the southern rim of the cliff to MEDICINE\r\nHOLE, from which, according to Indian tradition, the first buffalo\r\nemerged upon the earth. Today the hole is little more than an elongated\r\nthree-foot-deep depression in the flat limestone surface of the\r\nmountain top. It has been closed by the lodging, on the first ledge, of\r\na number of large rocks thrown into the aperture by curious visitors\r\ntrying to sound the bottom. It had been explored to a depth of 80 ft.\r\nbefore it was closed, but the extreme cold encountered below that depth\r\nmade further exploration difficult. In summer a cold draught of air\r\nformerly rose from the hole, and in winter a column of steam.\r\n\r\nJust W. of Medicine Hole to SIGNAL ROCK, said to have been used as\r\nan Indian signal station. From the cliff top here the buildings of\r\nthe Diamond C Ranch and the site of the Battle of Killdeer Mountains\r\n(_see above_) are visible to the S. Part way down the southern slope\r\nof the mountain, from E. to W. in the order named, rise the odd rock\r\nformations known as the THREE SISTERS, the COLISEUM, and SOLOMON'S\r\nTEMPLE. The Three Sisters are slender spires pointing upward from a\r\ncommon base; the Coliseum, which belies its name, is a tall pillar of\r\nsandstone shaped like an hourglass; and the Temple is a long, narrow,\r\ngray formation. Continuing W. along the rim of the cliff, the hike\r\ntrail leads to EAGLE ROCK, so named because of the eagle nests once\r\nnumerous here, and after touching the timbered edge of Dead Man's\r\nGulch, retraces its route to Oakdale.\r\n\r\nFew large wild animals remain in the Killdeer Mountains, but in 1848-49\r\nJohn Palliser, an English sportsman, and his party killed five grizzly\r\nbears here. Deer were once plentiful also. Pioneer cattlemen still tell\r\nof the Wolf Leader, a savage animal, half wolf and half collie, that\r\nled a pack of wolves in depredations upon the herds of the region.\r\nConspicuous because of the white ring around his neck, the Wolf Leader\r\nwas the bane of ranchers for many years before he was trapped.\r\n\r\nWest of Killdeer the route proceeds along the valley of Spring Creek\r\nthrough the foothills of the Killdeer Mountains to the junction with US\r\n85 at =141.5 m.=, =24 m.= S. of Watford City (_see Tour 4_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOUR 9\r\n\r\n\r\n  (McIntosh, S. Dak.)--Hettinger--Bowman--Marmarth--(Miles City,\r\n  Mont.). US 12.\r\n\r\n  South Dakota Line to Montana Line, 94 m.\r\n\r\n  Milwaukee R. R. parallels route.\r\n\r\n  Graveled roadbed.\r\n\r\n  Accommodations in principal towns.\r\n\r\nUS 12 cuts across the southwestern corner of North Dakota through an\r\narea where herds of cattle and flocks of sheep graze on the hardy\r\nprairie grasses that grow in the small valleys between high, rough,\r\nbrown mesa-topped buttes. The day of the pioneer homesteader and\r\nrancher is barely in the past here, and only within recent years has\r\ndiversified farming gradually been adopted. Near its western end the\r\nroute passes through the southern part of the Badlands, a strange land\r\nof fantastic enchantment where ever-changing combinations of color and\r\nshadow form a background of weird beauty (_see Tour 8_).\r\n\r\nUS 12 crosses the South Dakota Line at =0.0 m.= on a railroad overpass\r\nat White Butte, S. Dak. (_see S. Dak. Tour 2_).\r\n\r\nAt =1 m.= the route passes through a level area adjacent to HIDDEN WOOD\r\nCREEK (L), also called Flat Creek. Along its course, approximately a\r\nmile apart and covered with brush, are two cutbanks known as BRUSHY\r\nBANKS, near which the Custer Black Hills expedition camped on the way\r\nfrom Fort Abraham Lincoln in 1874.\r\n\r\nOn Hidden Wood Creek in this vicinity in 1882 was situated the main\r\ncamp of the Indians from the Standing Rock Reservation who took part\r\nin the last big buffalo hunt of the Sioux tribe, said to be the last\r\nlarge hunt in the United States, held under the direction of Maj. James\r\nMcLaughlin, then Indian agent at Fort Yates (_see Side Tour 8C_).\r\n\r\nIn the years following the Custer episode in 1876 (_see_ HISTORY _and_\r\nFORT ABRAHAM LINCOLN STATE PARK) many of the Sioux, except the faithful\r\nfew who accompanied Sitting Bull into exile in Canada (_see Side Tours\r\n6B and 8C_), returned to the reservations to assimilate the white man's\r\ncivilization. Before the white man's restrictions had been placed upon\r\nthem the Plains Indians had been trained from childhood to the pursuit\r\nof the buffalo, for the buffalo was the staff of the Indian's life,\r\nproviding food, shelter, and clothing. The hunt in 1882 caused much\r\nrejoicing among the tribesmen, offering them a temporary respite from\r\nthe humdrum reservation life, and a brief return to the activity which\r\nhad once existed in this land that was rightfully theirs.\r\n\r\nLong and extensive preparations were made for this hunt. Strict\r\nreligious ceremonies invoked the blessing of the Great Mystery. Running\r\nAntelope, whose picture was on the old five-dollar Treasury notes, was\r\ngeneralissimo of the affair, while under him, leading the different\r\nbands, were such famed Indians as Gall, Rain-in-the-Face, John Grass,\r\nFire Heart, Kill Eagle, Crazy Walking, Spotted Horn Bull, Gray Eagle,\r\nand Charging Thunder.\r\n\r\nApproximately 2,000 men, women, and children, including a few white\r\nmen, made the 100-mile journey from Fort Yates to the scene of the\r\nhunt, and McLaughlin estimated that more than 600 mounted red men took\r\npart in the actual killing. The herd, said to number 50,000 head, was\r\nfirst sighted near White Butte, 10 m. S. of the present South Dakota\r\ntown of the same name, and covered the valley from that point to Haynes\r\n(_see below_). On the first day of the hunt 2,000 buffalo were killed,\r\nand the second day was given to skinning and cutting up the dead\r\nanimals. The third day found the Indians again on the chase, and this\r\ntime 3,000 bison were killed. The Hidden Wood Creek camp was maintained\r\nuntil all the meat was cured and ready to take back to the reservation.\r\nYears later when the railroad was built, many of the settlers made a\r\nnice profit shipping the bones of the buffalo carcasses left from this\r\nhunt.\r\n\r\nHAYNES, =3 m.= (2,540 alt., 167 pop.), was named for George B. Haynes,\r\ngeneral passenger agent of the Milwaukee R. R. when it constructed its\r\nmain line in 1907.\r\n\r\nAt =5 m.= are the junctions with ND 8, a graveled highway, and with an\r\nunimproved county dirt road. US 12 turns L.\r\n\r\n1. Right from the junction on the unimproved road to the rammed-earth\r\nhome and garage of the SCORIA LILY RANCH, =5 m.= The owner, Col. Paul\r\nS. Bliss, naturalist and author of three books of North Dakota verse,\r\nhas had the two buildings erected as an example of the practical use of\r\nearth for permanent, low-cost farm buildings. In the building process\r\nearth is packed into plank forms. After \"setting\" it forms a durable,\r\nheat-and cold-resisting wall.\r\n\r\n2. Straight ahead on ND 8 to the abandoned workings of the STATE MINE,\r\n=0.5 m.= (R), an underground lignite mine once owned and used for\r\nexperimental purposes by the South Dakota School of Mines. The mine was\r\nabandoned several years ago when the coal vein caught fire. The coal is\r\nstill burning, and occasionally at night the red glow of this earthly\r\nfurnace is visible where the tunnel timbering and earth have caved\r\nin, leaving the hillsides pockmarked and scarred. Nearby on two short\r\nrails is a rusty railroad steam engine, its gears fast in the grip of\r\nrust and its wooden cab nearly eaten away by wind and rain. Deserted,\r\nit stands where it was last stopped before the rails of the spur from\r\nHaynes to the mine were taken up.\r\n\r\nAt =9 m.= on US 12 is the junction with an unimproved county dirt road.\r\n\r\nLeft on this road to PRAIRIE SPHINX BUTTE (R), =2.5 m.=, where the\r\nsteep sandstone outcroppings at the top of the formation resemble the\r\nfeatures of the Gizeh Sphinx.\r\n\r\nHETTINGER, =13 m.= (2,668 alt., 1,292 pop.), seat of Adams County, is\r\nat the foot of a high hill rising from the valley of Hidden Wood Creek.\r\nAdams County was formerly part of Hettinger County, named for Mathias\r\nHettinger, a Freeport, Ill., banker. When the counties were separated\r\nin 1907 each wished to retain the original name, and a compromise was\r\nfinally effected whereby the new county could use the old name for its\r\ncounty seat. The new brick COURTHOUSE (R) was built in 1929.\r\n\r\nHettinger's first newspaper editor was a man of unusual enterprise. As\r\nhe hauled his press overland from Dickinson, he stopped everyone he\r\nmet to tell them about his forthcoming publication, and by the time he\r\nreached Hettinger he had procured nearly 100 subscriptions. In 1908\r\nthis paper, the Adams County _Record_, was appointed official paper for\r\nHettinger, and in one of the first resolutions it published citizens\r\nwere instructed to remove their buildings from the streets, where, in\r\nthe rush of locating, they had built with little regard for the town\r\nsite plat.\r\n\r\nBUCYRUS, =22 m.= (2,778 alt., 124 pop.), was first known as Dolan, in\r\nhonor of the contractor for the Milwaukee R. R. grade there. During the\r\ngrading a new name was sought for the town, however, and Bucyrus, the\r\ntrade name of one of the huge steam shovels in use, was suggested and\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nREEDER, =31 m.= (2,810 alt., 395 pop.), was named for E. O. Reeder,\r\nwho at the time of the founding of the town was chief engineer for the\r\nMilwaukee R. R. Alden Scott Boyer, now a well-known American and French\r\ncosmetics manufacturer, operated a drug store here in 1909-13.\r\n\r\nRight from Reeder on ND 22, a graveled road, to LOOKOUT POINT, =2\r\nm.=, an elevation from which five towns, Reeder, Bucyrus, Gascoyne,\r\nScranton, and Buffalo Springs, are visible.\r\n\r\nWHETSTONE BUTTES (L), =9 m.=, a high range of hills visible for\r\nmiles, are topped by a peculiar sandstone formation which is so hard\r\nthat pieces from it were used by the Indians and early settlers for\r\nsharpening their tools and weapons.\r\n\r\nGASCOYNE, =38 m.= (2,759 alt., 97 pop.), is L. of the highway.\r\nNorthwest of town is a railroad RESERVOIR (_swimming and picnicking\r\nfacilities_).\r\n\r\nSCRANTON, =43 m.= (2,773 alt., 381 pop.), is a namesake of Scranton,\r\nPa., because both are coal-mining towns. The first mine here opened in\r\n1907, preceding the railroad which arrived late that year and providing\r\nthe impetus for the town which grew up. The discovery of suitable clay\r\nresulted in the establishment of a brick plant, the product of which\r\ncan be seen in many of the buildings in the town. On each side of the\r\nhighway as it passes the Milwaukee R. R. station are two round markers\r\npicturing the head of a Texas longhorn steer and carrying the legend,\r\n\"Comin' up the Texas Chisholm Trail.\" The markers indicate one of the\r\ntrails by which cattle were brought to this part of the Great Plains.\r\nAlthough the Chisholm Trail is believed to have run no farther N. than\r\nAbilene, Kan., the name has often been loosely applied to other trails\r\nrunning N. of that city, unofficial extensions of the original route\r\nfrom the Panhandle region (_see Tour 4_).\r\n\r\nBUFFALO SPRINGS, =48.5 m.= (2,850 alt., 75 pop.), was known briefly\r\nas Ingomar, but in 1907 received its present name, suggested by the\r\nnearby springs which once served as a watering place for the bison that\r\nroamed the plains. East of town is a railroad RESERVOIR (_swimming_,\r\n_fishing_). A COLLECTION (_open; inquire directions at post office_) of\r\nIndian artifacts, pioneer relics, petrified woods, and other curios,\r\ngathered by Ed Gorman, may be seen at his hardware store.\r\n\r\nBOWMAN, =56.5 m.= (_see Tour 4_), is the junction with US 85 (_see Tour\r\n4_).\r\n\r\nRHAME, =73 m.= (3,184 alt., 356 pop.), named for M. D. Rhame, district\r\nengineer of the Milwaukee R. R. when it was established in 1907, has\r\nthe highest elevation of any town in the State. It is in a high valley\r\nbetween two large, flat, scoria-capped buttes.\r\n\r\nAt =78 m.= is the junction with an unimproved country dirt road.\r\n\r\nRight on this road, across the railroad, to FORT DILTS STATE PARK (L),\r\n=2 m.=, marking the site where Capt. James L. Fisk's 80-wagon immigrant\r\ntrain, bound for the Montana gold fields, was corraled in defense\r\nformation for 14 days in September 1864. The expedition, accompanied\r\nby a cavalry detachment of 50 men, left Fort Rice in August, and\r\nencountered no trouble until September 1, when a wagon overturned\r\nin crossing a steep-sided creek. Fisk detailed another wagon and a\r\ndetachment of eight cavalrymen to remain and right the overturned\r\nvehicle. As soon as the main party was out of sight over a hill, a band\r\nof Hunkpapa Sioux--part of the group met by Sully at the Killdeer\r\nMountains (_see Side Tour 8D_) and in the Battle of the Badlands\r\n(_see Tour 8_)--who were at that time engaged in hunting buffalo,\r\nattacked the detachment, killing nine and mortally wounding three. The\r\nexpedition heard the rifle shots and returned to aid their comrades,\r\nbut were too late to do more than rout the Indians. Just as the natives\r\nwere being driven off, Jefferson Dilts, a scout for the expedition,\r\nreturned from reconnoitering in the Badlands, and rode directly into\r\nthe fleeing band of Sioux and was killed.\r\n\r\nThe expedition moved 10 m. the next day, and when it broke camp the\r\nmorning of September 3 a large box of poisoned hardtack was purposely\r\nleft behind. The Indians swooped down and hungrily devoured it, and it\r\nis said that 25 died from the effects of the poison, more than were\r\nkilled by the expedition's bullets. That day the wagon train advanced\r\nonly 3 m. before going into corral and beginning to throw up a defense,\r\nwhich they called Fort Dilts. Oxen and plows were used to obtain sod\r\nwith which a dirt wall 6 ft. high and nearly 2 ft. thick was built\r\noutside the ring of wagons. The cavalry was stationed between the wall\r\nand the wagons. That night 16 volunteers slipped through the Indian\r\nlines and after 3 days and nights of hard riding reached Fort Rice,\r\nwhence Col. Daniel J. Dill and a detachment set out at once. They\r\narrived September 17, but by that time the Hunkpapa had departed for\r\nCave Hills, S. Dak., where they had learned a large herd of bison was\r\nrunning. They had lingered only a day or two after the fortification\r\nwas thrown up, sniping at it occasionally, before their interest waned.\r\n\r\nThe State park, which contains approximately 9 acres belonging to the\r\nState historical society, was dedicated to Jefferson Dilts in 1932.\r\nWithin the fenced area are the remains of the sod fortification, and\r\neight Government grave markers have been placed inside it in memory of\r\nthose who lost their lives in the episode.\r\n\r\nMARMARTH, =87.5 m.= (2,709 alt., 721 pop.), is at the confluence of\r\nLittle Beaver Creek, Hay Creek, and the Little Missouri River. Known\r\nas the \"city of trees\", Marmarth is almost an oasis in the treeless\r\nBadlands country. Its name is derived from the mispronunciation of her\r\nown name, Margaret Martha, by a small granddaughter of the president\r\nof the Milwaukee R. R. The town had its inception in 1902, and grew\r\nrapidly following the advent of the Milwaukee R. R. in 1907 and\r\nthe establishment of a railroad division point here the next year.\r\nProximity to the Little Missouri and its tributaries has not always\r\nbeen advantageous; the town has been flooded five times--1907, 1913,\r\n1929, and twice in 1921. To prevent another flood a dam has been built\r\non Little Beaver Creek W. of town, and dikes have been put up around\r\nthe town adjacent to the streams.\r\n\r\nTheodore Roosevelt killed his first grizzly bear a short distance W. of\r\nMarmarth on the Little Beaver, and just N. of the town on the Little\r\nMissouri he shot his first buffalo. Many years later, when he was\r\ncampaigning for the Presidency, on an appearance in Minneapolis he met\r\na Marmarth pioneer. When informed the man was from Marmarth, at the\r\nmouth of Little Beaver Creek, the President exclaimed, \"A town there?\r\nDo you have boats tied to your back doors?\" He had visited the site\r\nonly at times of high water.\r\n\r\nMarmarth is a shipping point for cattle brought overland from range\r\ngrounds in this State, Montana, and South Dakota. The stockyards,\r\nwhich cover an area of 45 acres, and contain 86 pens and 15 loading\r\nchutes, are built on the site of the old O-X (O Bar X) ranch. Nearby,\r\non Hay Creek, still stands the squat old ranch house in which Theodore\r\nRoosevelt was once a guest.\r\n\r\nActivity in the Little Beaver Dome, an oil field near Marmarth (_see\r\nbelow_), brought the town a boom in 1936. Business buildings and\r\nresidences that had long stood idle were quickly occupied.\r\n\r\nAt =88.5 m.= is the junction with ND 16, an unimproved road.\r\n\r\nLeft on this highway to the junction with a country trail, =2 m.=; L.\r\nhere =1 m.= to THE WOMAN IN STONE, a 50-foot rock which shows the head\r\nand face of a woman, even to the hairline, clearly outlined against\r\nthe sky. The form of the sandstone is the result of countless years of\r\nweathering.\r\n\r\nOn ND 16 to a junction with a well-defined prairie trail, =16 m.=; R.\r\non this trail to the NUMBER TWO WELL of the Little Beaver Dome, =21 m.=\r\nWork has not advanced far on this well, but results of the Number One\r\nWell, just over the State Line in Montana, show a crude oil apparently\r\nhigh in gasoline and kerosene content, very light, but darker in color,\r\nand with a somewhat different odor from that usually associated with\r\nmid-continent crude oils. The Little Beaver Dome is part of the Cedar\r\nCreek Anticline, a geologic formation of arched rock strata extending\r\nfrom eastern Montana into southwestern North Dakota. It is one of the\r\ngreatest natural gas fields in the United States.\r\n\r\nUS 12 crosses the Montana Line at =94 m.=, 95 m. E. of Miles City,\r\nMont. (_see Mont. Tour 17_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOUR 10 (Water Route)\r\n\r\n\r\n  Medora--South Roosevelt Regional State Park--Beaver River--North\r\n  Roosevelt Regional State Park--Cherry Creek--Missouri\r\n  River--Elbowoods--Stanton--Fort Clark--Washburn--Bismarck.\r\n\r\n  Route: Little Missouri and Missouri Rivers.\r\n\r\n  Medora to Bismarck, 350 m. (by river), 10 to 20 days.\r\n\r\n  N. P. Ry. parallels route from Stanton to Bismarck.\r\n\r\n  =Special equipment:= Light duffle, including 7 x 7 tent, waterproof\r\n  sleeping bags, waterproof duffle bags, complete change outdoor\r\n  clothing; flat-bottomed boat capable carrying 1,000 lb., of not\r\n  more than 5 in. draft for party of three; complete camping gear. No\r\n  accommodations available.\r\n\r\n  =Food:= Fourteen days supply, carried in paraffin-treated bags;\r\n  mainly canned goods--soups, meats, vegetables, and milk; flour,\r\n  salt, sugar, coffee, and cocoa; dried fruits. Butter hard to keep.\r\n  Biscuits can be made en route.\r\n\r\n  =Water:= Carry light water cask or bag. Refill at various ranch\r\n  houses. Use chlorine or iodine in settled river water.\r\n\r\n  =Warning:= No trip for \"tenderfeet\" unless accompanied by\r\n  experienced guide and riverman; select night camps on high ground\r\n  at safe distance back from river's bank, overhanging banks may\r\n  cave in, creek and gully bottoms subject to suddenly rising water\r\n  if rain falls; tie boats to trees on high ground, boat may be\r\n  lost in sudden rise of river if tied too low; avoid drifting near\r\n  overhanging cutbanks along stream, landslides dangerous to small\r\n  boats occur occasionally; watch channels for snags; high, upstream\r\n  winds dangerous on Missouri; carry antivenom serum for treatment of\r\n  possible rattlesnake bites.\r\n\r\n  =Seasons:= Latter part of June or first weeks of July. Spring\r\n  floods and early June rise make rivers treacherous; dry seasons of\r\n  late summer may require portage of Little Missouri.\r\n\r\n  =Maps:= Highway Planning Survey, Bismarck, N. Dak., can furnish\r\n  county maps.\r\n\r\nFor the experienced camper, for the seeker of adventures, for the\r\nlover of nature, this route offers much pleasure; it is on the Little\r\nMissouri River through the heart of North Dakota's Badlands and down\r\nthe Missouri River to Bismarck. During past ages the Little Missouri\r\nhas been the chief agent in cutting into the prairies of North Dakota\r\nthe wide slash that is the Badlands region. Rain and surface waters\r\nhave washed away the soft upper layers of the deposits made by\r\nsuccessive prehistoric seas, and, continually seeking lower levels, in\r\nthe slow process of erosion through the centuries have left a jumble\r\nof jagged buttes. The sides of these buttes expose the various strata,\r\neach the testimonial of one age in the geological history of the area.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the Missouri and Little Missouri were navigated by many an\r\nIndian hunter in search of the big game that once roamed the region,\r\nand by many a brave seeking the scalp of some unwary opponent; but\r\nBaptiste Le Page, the French explorer who made the voyage from the\r\nBlack Hills (which title then designated all the rough upland country\r\nW. of the Missouri here) to the mouth of the Knife River in 45 days in\r\n1804, is believed to have been the first white man to journey down the\r\ntortuous Little Missouri into the Missouri, called Wakpa Hehanka (_elk\r\nriver_) by the Sioux. Le Page joined the Lewis and Clark expedition at\r\none of the Indian villages near the mouth of the Knife River.\r\n\r\nWhile Le Page drifted down almost the entire course of the Little\r\nMissouri, the modern would-be explorer following this route slips his\r\nboat into the historic waters more than halfway down the stream at\r\nMEDORA (2,265 alt., 200 pop.) (_see Tour 8_), and heads downstream with\r\nthe current.\r\n\r\nNorth of Medora the river flows through a comparatively wide flood\r\nplain dotted with groves of cottonwood, box elder, and ash trees, with\r\nhigh, many-colored buttes rising on both sides to form the deep valley.\r\n\r\nAt about =1 m.= (R) is SHEEP CREEK, an intermittent tributary named for\r\nthe bighorn mountain sheep that were found in the Badlands when white\r\nmen first visited them. Along Sheep Creek are a few bull pines, _Pinus\r\nponderosa scopulorum_, probably the northern limit of the species in\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nAt about =1.5 m.= (L) is ANDREWS CREEK, and at about 1.8 m. downstream\r\nfrom Medora the river crosses the southern boundary of the South\r\nRoosevelt Regional State Park (_see_ ROOSEVELT REGIONAL STATE PARKS).\r\nAt =2.8 m.= the park highway fords the Little Missouri, and at times\r\nof low water caution is necessary here in navigating the ford. To the\r\nR. after passing the highway is one of the park picnic areas, and just\r\nbelow these grounds is the mouth of KNUTSON CREEK (L), at about =4.3 m.=\r\n\r\nBelow the buildings (R) of the PEACEFUL VALLEY RANCH (_see_ SOUTH\r\nROOSEVELT REGIONAL STATE PARK) is the mouth of PADDOCK CREEK (R), =5.8\r\nm.=, and at about =8.8 m.= the route passes JUEL CREEK (R). At about\r\n=11.5 m.= is GOVERNMENT CREEK (R), and at about =17 m.= WANNAGAN CREEK\r\n(L), the northern boundary of the park.\r\n\r\nA few miles below the boundary is the PARKER RANCH (L), formerly\r\nthe Wadsworth, said to be the first cattle ranch in the Badlands.\r\nDownstream from these buildings is ASH COULEE CREEK (R), named for the\r\nmany ash trees that line its broad valley. It should be reached in\r\na day of ordinary drifting. (_Good camping place for first night is\r\nopposite the mouth of this little stream._)\r\n\r\nDuring the entire first day's journey the unusual beauty of the\r\nBadlands formations is revealed, but even more detail is evident as the\r\nsetting sun lengthens the shadows cast by the hills and intensifies\r\nthe reds, ochers, grays, greens, and taupes that form the weird color\r\ncombinations of the region.\r\n\r\nAt =40 m.= is the SITE OF THE CABIN OF THEODORE ROOSEVELT'S ELKHORN\r\nRANCH (L). Only a few foundation stones and a depression in the\r\nflat river flood plain show where the cabin stood. The Rough Rider\r\nPresident, who ran cattle on two ranches in the Badlands in the 1880's\r\n(_see Tour 8_), spent the greater share of his time at the Elkhorn,\r\nusing it as headquarters for hunting expeditions into the surrounding\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nNearest neighbor of the future President was Howard Eaton, whose\r\nVI Ranch at =48 m.= was near the mouth of BEAVER RIVER, the Little\r\nMissouri's largest tributary. (_Opposite confluence here is good\r\ncamping place._) Beaver River was first called Big Beaver Creek to\r\ndistinguish it from Little Beaver (_see Tour 9_).\r\n\r\nNorth of Beaver River the stream pursues its way in a meandering\r\ncourse, winding 14 m. to cross a single township, and passing MAGPIE\r\nand BEICEGEL (Bicycle) CREEKS. Magpie receives its name from the\r\nlong-tailed black and white bird that is found in the area, while\r\nBeicegel (despite the spelling) is named for the Beisigl brothers who\r\nwere early ranchers along its banks. They still (1938) live in North\r\nDakota near Lemmon, S. Dak. (_Bet. Beicegel Creek and a point 2 m.\r\nfarther down river are many places suitable for camp._)\r\n\r\nThus far the river current has been anything but swift, and the stream\r\nhas been flowing between banks quite widely separated. As the trip is\r\nresumed on the fourth day the river soon narrows and becomes a swiftly\r\nrushing stream. Snags and submerged tree trunks that heretofore were\r\neasily avoided now become a danger to the unwary voyager. The added\r\nspeed makes navigation more difficult, and a snag through the bottom of\r\nthe boat at this point would precipitate disaster, the probable loss of\r\nequipment adding to the hardships of getting out of the rough country\r\non foot.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of REDWING CREEK are some of the finest views of\r\nthe entire journey. Grotesque formations carved in the wind-blown,\r\nrain-washed buttes are set off by cedar-dotted slopes and river flats\r\ncovered with sage.\r\n\r\nIn the Redwing Creek area the river enters the southern boundary of the\r\nNorth Roosevelt Regional State Park (_see_ ROOSEVELT REGIONAL STATE\r\nPARKS), and a short hike left of the Little Missouri leads to one of\r\nthe largest areas of PETRIFIED FOREST in the Badlands. Great silicified\r\nstumps, weighing many tons, are found perched atop slender pillars of\r\ngray, yellow, and ocher sandstone, and logs, sometimes several feet\r\nlong and 12 to 14 inches in diameter, are found here.\r\n\r\nDownstream from the Redwing, in a sharp bend of the river, SPERATI\r\nPOINT rises to the L. The point is named for Dr. Carlo A. Sperati,\r\ndirector of the Luther College (Decorah, Iowa) Band at the time it\r\nvisited here in 1927. From the summit is an exceptional view of\r\nthe GRAND CANYON OF THE LITTLE MISSOURI. The river makes an almost\r\nright-angle turn to the E. here toward its confluence with the\r\nMissouri, and its flood plain again widens and the current is less\r\nswift.\r\n\r\nThe SQUAW CREEK PICNIC AREA (_see_ NORTH ROOSEVELT REGIONAL STATE PARK)\r\nis the only man-made camping place on the entire trip. It was at a\r\nsheep ranch on Squaw Creek that the \"vigilantes\" of 1884 dropped in for\r\none of their raids, and burned 500 tons of hay, the barn, harnesses,\r\nand all machinery, and set fire to the prairie, burning a large area.\r\n\r\nThe glistening silver steel of the ROOSEVELT BRIDGE spans the Little\r\nMissouri, over which US 85 passes, and just E. of which is the eastern\r\nentrance to the North Roosevelt Park (_see Tour 4_). US 85 is the\r\neastern boundary of the northern park.\r\n\r\nCHARLIE BOB CREEK (R) drains the area N. and W. of the Killdeer\r\nMountains (_see Side Tour 8D_). Here the buttes R. of the river rise\r\n500 to 600 ft. above the stream bed, and the noonday shadows cast by\r\nthe scattered groves of cedar on the northern slopes are cool and\r\ninviting. A climb to the butte tops reveals their precipitous, barren\r\nsouthern slopes.\r\n\r\nThe wide valley (L) of CHERRY CREEK (_good overnight camping place\r\nopposite mouth_), together with Tobacco Garden Creek (_see Tour 6_),\r\nwhich drains N. into the Missouri, in preglacial times was probably the\r\nbed of the Little Missouri, the present valley of which was formed when\r\nthe glacier blocked the former course and diverted the waters in an\r\neasterly direction.\r\n\r\nAt about a half-day's journey below Cherry Creek a climb to the high\r\nriver bluffs, through thickets of red birch, aspen, and oak trees,\r\nleads to a superb view. Southward from the butte tops a blue haze\r\noutlines the Killdeer Mountains, from which the Sioux fled after the\r\nBattle of Killdeer Mountains (_see Side Tour 8D_) to take refuge in\r\nthis very section of the Badlands, the rough terrain of which prevented\r\nthe army from pursuing. It was in this vicinity in 1886 that young\r\nTheodore Roosevelt and two of his ranch hands captured three thieves\r\nwho had stolen a boat from his Elkhorn Ranch and had plundered almost\r\nevery ranch house along the river. Roosevelt and his men pursued the\r\nthree for several days before surrounding their camp and taking them\r\ncompletely by surprise. He then sent his men home and took the culprits\r\noverland to Dickinson, where he preferred charges against the two\r\nleaders, who were tried and subsequently served their sentences; one\r\nwas later hanged for horse stealing in Montana. The third marauder, an\r\nelderly man, Roosevelt said was the \"kind of person who was not capable\r\nof doing either much good or harm.\" When the old man thanked him\r\nprofusely for thus befriending him, the future President remarked that\r\nit was the first time he had been thanked for calling a man a fool.\r\n\r\nBetween ELK and JIM'S CREEKS (R) the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation\r\nlies to the L. (_Good camping places bet. Elk and Jim's Creeks._)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  LIGNITE STRIP MINING, VELVA\r\n\r\n                                   _Courtesy Truax-Traer Coal Co._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ARIKARA\r\n  WOMAN\r\n  POUNDING\r\n  CHERRIES\r\n\r\n  _Photo by Russell Reid_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n                                                                WRITING\r\n                                                                ROCK,\r\n                                                                NEAR\r\n                                                                GRENORA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n                                         LAKE UPSILON, TURTLE MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\n  _Photo by Russell Reid_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BUFFALO, SULLY'S HILL NATIONAL GAME PRESERVE]\r\n\r\nBelow Jim's Creek the river widens, its flood plain covers a large\r\narea on either side of the stream, broadening the valley along which\r\nthe hills begin to be more grassy and less rugged and colorful. At the\r\nconfluence with HANS CREEK (R) the river makes an abrupt right-angle\r\nturn L., and while the valley still remains wide, the stream itself\r\nnarrows and runs more swiftly. (_Good overnight camp sites in the\r\nIndian reservation._)\r\n\r\nBelow the North Roosevelt Park ranches are fewer, and people are seldom\r\nseen from the river.\r\n\r\nThe wider, majestic Missouri is soon reached, and forms the route for\r\nthe remainder of the voyage. Up this avenue of exploration came Lewis\r\nand Clark, Maximilian, Catlin, Ashley, Lisa, and other adventurous\r\nexplorers and traders; first in the round, unwieldy, skin bullboats of\r\nthe Indians, and later in the chugging steamboats, plying the river\r\nin search of trade between the tribes and forts established along its\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nThe seasonal rising and lowering of the Missouri's water level\r\ncontinually changes the channel, leaving shoals, sand bars, and snags,\r\nand these offered a problem to river pilots as long as steamboat\r\ntraffic flourished on the river. When a flat-bottomed steamer ran\r\naground it took hours, and sometimes days, to release it. It was from\r\nthe odd device used to work the boats off sand bars that the term\r\n\"grasshoppering\" came into use. Each steamer carried two long, heavy\r\nspars, similar to telephone poles, near the bow ready for use. Capt.\r\nGrant Marsh, an old river pilot, describes the operation of these spars\r\nin Joseph Mills Hanson's _Conquest of the Missouri_:\r\n\r\n  \"When she became lodged on a bar, the spars were raised and set\r\n  in the river bottom, like posts, their tops inclined somewhat\r\n  toward the bow. Above the line of the deck each was rigged with\r\n  a tackle-block over which a manila cable was passed, one end\r\n  being fastened to the gunwale of the boat and the other end wound\r\n  around the capstan. As the capstan was turned and the paddlewheel\r\n  revolved, the boat was thus lifted and pushed forward. Then the\r\n  spars were re-set farther ahead and the process repeated until\r\n  the boat was at last literally lifted over the bar. From the\r\n  grotesque resemblance to a grasshopper which the craft bore when\r\n  her spars were set, and from the fact that she might be said to\r\n  move forward in a series of hops, the practice came to be called\r\n  'grasshoppering.'\"\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning river steamers were dependent on wood for fuel, and\r\nas traffic increased woodyards became more numerous along the stream.\r\nAt first they were operated only by the hardiest of white frontiersmen,\r\nbut as the agency Indians absorbed the white man's civilization they\r\ntoo began to cut wood to sell. Steamers usually burned either cedar\r\nor cottonwood, although the latter was suitable for fuel only when\r\nfully dried, while cedar burned readily either green or cured. Boat\r\ncaptains took all the cedar the Indians could stack, but would not stop\r\ntheir boats when they saw only green cottonwood corded. The Indians\r\nsoon learned a subterfuge to surmount the difficulty of having only\r\ncottonwood on hand. They smeared the freshly hewn ends of cottonwood\r\ncuttings with vermilion so that it resembled cedar, stacked the wood\r\nwith the painted ends toward the river, and trusted that when a boat\r\nstopped she would take the camouflaged cottonwood rather than waste\r\nmore time.\r\n\r\nThe Missouri passes beneath the black steel span of FOUR BEARS BRIDGE,\r\nthe bridge with 19 Indian names (_see Side Tour 3A_.) Approximately 2\r\nm. below the bridge the river passes within 2 m. of ELBOWOODS (_see\r\nSide Tour 3A_), inland to the L., the first town neared in the more\r\nthan 200 m. of drifting since Medora was left behind. (_Good camp site\r\non the Elbowoods side of the Missouri_.)\r\n\r\nOn the bluffs opposite Elbowoods is the SITE OF A HIDATSA INDIAN\r\nVILLAGE, which according to tradition was once besieged by the Sioux,\r\nwho expected to win an easy victory by curtailing the village water\r\nsupply. Hidatsa scouts, however, had learned of the planned attack,\r\nand the people in the village made rock-filled reservoirs and carried\r\nwater from the river to fill them. Repulsing the first attack of the\r\nSioux, the besieged rolled a skin of water down the hill toward their\r\nenemy, which, the legend says, so discouraged the besiegers that they\r\nabandoned their efforts to capture the village and withdrew.\r\n\r\nThe reservation borders both sides of the river from here to a point a\r\nshort distance downstream from Ree.\r\n\r\nBelow Elbowoods the river passes the sites of GRANDMOTHER'S LODGE, FORT\r\nBERTHOLD, REE, and NISHU (_see Side Tour 3A_). EXPANSION (R) consists\r\nof a post office and store marking the site of a formerly active river\r\ntown. (_Good camp site bet. Ree and Expansion._)\r\n\r\nJust upstream W. of Expansion is a large, easily detected sandstone\r\npromontory known as MANUEL ROCK (R), used as a landmark by old river\r\npilots, and named for the fur trader Manuel Lisa.\r\n\r\nBelow Expansion are (L) the mouth of GARRISON CREEK and the SITE OF\r\nFORT STEVENSON. The site was selected by Gen. Alfred H. Sully in 1864\r\non his trip down the Missouri during his second campaign, but the fort\r\nwas not established until 1867. A two-company post named for Brig. Gen.\r\nThomas G. Stevenson, the fort was abandoned in 1883 and the military\r\nreservation turned over to the Interior Department. For a short time\r\nthe buildings were used as a school for Indian children from the Fort\r\nBerthold Agency. Garrison Creek was originally called Douglas Creek,\r\nbut the name was changed when the Stevenson garrison began using it for\r\nbathing purposes.\r\n\r\nA few miles below Garrison Creek is SNAKE CREEK (L), called Ma po ksa a\r\nti a zi (Hidatsa, _snake house river_), where a cave along the banks of\r\nthe Missouri near the mouth of the creek, according to legend, swarmed\r\nwith snakes at certain seasons.\r\n\r\nA short distance downstream from the Fort Stevenson site the course\r\nof the Missouri turns S. and passes MANNHAVEN (R), remnant of a once\r\nthriving river town. Near the present village in 1809 the Missouri Fur\r\nCo., directed by Manuel Lisa, erected a trading post known variously as\r\nFort Manuel Lisa and Fort Lewis, the latter for Reuben Lewis--brother\r\nof Meriwether Lewis, coleader of the Lewis and Clark expedition--who\r\noperated it until its abandonment in 1812. Under the name of Fort\r\nVanderburgh, the site was later occupied briefly in 1822 or 1823.\r\nLisa, born in New Orleans of Spanish parents, is said to have had more\r\ninfluence over the Indians with whom he dealt than any other trader to\r\nenter the Missouri area, although his activities in the Missouri basin\r\nwere of only 13 years duration. He died in St. Louis at the age of 48.\r\n\r\nThe mouth of the KNIFE RIVER is just upstream from STANTON (_see Side\r\nTour 8D_). (_Camp can be made on R. river bank._)\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of the confluence of the Knife and Missouri are the\r\nsites of many Indian villages, Hidatsa, Mandan, and Arikara, the\r\nlocations of which are easily traceable by the many round, dish-like\r\ndepressions marking the sites of earth lodges in the villages. The\r\nHidatsa had three villages here until 1837 when the smallpox epidemic\r\nreduced their population to only one village. Prior to their occupation\r\nof the Knife River vicinity the tribe lived near the mouth of the Heart\r\nRiver (_see Tour 8_), and in 1845, for protection from the Sioux, they\r\nmoved to Fort Berthold. The Mandans, whose two villages some miles\r\nbelow the Knife were reduced to little more than 100 persons by the\r\nsmallpox epidemic of 1837, moved to a small village near the Hidatsa,\r\nand followed that tribe to Fort Berthold in 1845. Migrating up the\r\nMissouri at a later date, the Arikara built villages near the Knife as\r\nlate as 1851, but they too, because of continued Sioux raids, moved to\r\nFort Berthold.\r\n\r\nIt was at one of the Knife River villages, that Charbonneau, and his\r\nShoshone Indian wife, Sakakawea, lived in 1804 when Lewis and Clark\r\nemployed Charbonneau as interpreter of the expedition to the Pacific\r\n(_see_ BISMARCK).\r\n\r\nBelow Stanton is DEAPOLIS (R), marked by a single grain elevator,\r\nall that remains of another of the towns that sprang up along the\r\nMissouri, flourished, and declined with the steamboat trade. The place\r\nwas named by its founder, who replaced the first letter in the name of\r\nthe ancient city Neapolis with the first letter of his own surname,\r\nDanielson.\r\n\r\nOld residents tell the story that in the summer of 1894 the river at\r\nDeapolis was extremely low, exposing a huge boulder in the center\r\nof the stream. An interested group made their way to the stone, and\r\nfound it carved with peculiar markings they were unable to decipher.\r\nBefore leaving they added the date of their visit to the inscription.\r\nForty years later the river stage again was low enough to bring the\r\nstone above water, and a second party visited it, and found the same\r\nundecipherable markings as well as the carving of the 1894 party.\r\n\r\nNear the Deapolis elevator is the SITE OF BIG WHITE'S MANDAN INDIAN\r\nVILLAGE. Big White was the Mandan chief taken to Washington by Lewis\r\nand Clark on their return from the Pacific, and his village was one\r\nof two Mandan towns visited by the expedition on the journey up the\r\nMissouri in 1804-5. The other, Black Cat's Village, was on the L. bank\r\nof the river farther upstream. Lewis and Clark's Fort Mandan was built\r\non the L. bank downstream from the Deapolis site, but the changing\r\nriver channel has removed all trace of the fort, and Black Cat's\r\nVillage has never been definitely located (_see Tour 3_).\r\n\r\nSouth of Deapolis is the SITE OF FORT CLARK TRADING POST (R), for which\r\nthe present village of FORT CLARK (1,726 alt., 46 pop.), downstream\r\n=1.5 m.=, is named. The post, a well stockaded fort 132 x 147 ft.,\r\nwas built in 1829 by James Kipp for the American Fur Co. and named\r\nfor William Clark of the Lewis and Clark expedition. Because of its\r\nflourishing trade with the Mandans it was for several years second\r\nonly to Fort Union in Missouri importance, but it was closed during\r\nthe smallpox epidemic of 1837, and a few years later was abandoned by\r\nthe company. The Arikara Indians reoccupied the site in the 1850's in\r\ntheir migration up the Missouri. Today there are slight excavations and\r\nscars marking the outline of the fort stockade walls, and traces of the\r\nIndian habitation.\r\n\r\nScorched Village, according to Hidatsa legend, had its locale near\r\nthe present city of WASHBURN (L) (_see Tour 3_), but the Indians say\r\nthat the site of the legendary village has been swallowed by the\r\never-shifting channel of the river.\r\n\r\nThe river passes WILDWOOD LAKE and the PAINTED WOODS (L) (_see Side\r\nTour 3B_), and the town (R) of SANGER (1,712 alt., 70 pop.), named for\r\nits first settlers, C. H. and George Sanger. (_Camp can be made in\r\nvicinity of town; L. bank more accessible_.)\r\n\r\nThe route passes (R) the post office of PRICE (1,700 alt., 10 pop.),\r\nnamed for William Price, the first homesteader in the vicinity. Price\r\nis on the northern slopes of the flat-topped formations known as SQUARE\r\nBUTTES (_see Side Tour 3B_). Below these bold buttes is (L) DOUBLE\r\nDITCH INDIAN VILLAGE STATE PARK (_see Side Tour 3B_), and a short\r\ndistance below that the route passes (R) the mouth of SQUARE BUTTE\r\nCREEK (see _Side Tour 8D_).\r\n\r\nThe resting place of the last physical traces of steamboating on the\r\nupper Missouri, ROCK HAVEN (R), is passed almost in sight of the black\r\nsteel link of railroad bridge spanning the river near Bismarck. The\r\nadvent of the railroad spelled the decline of river traffic, but before\r\nits coming Rock Haven was a river drydock and boat yard, and today\r\nthree old craft which have seen sporadic service in the last decade are\r\nresting on large skids, drawn up from the waters once churned by their\r\npaddle wheels.\r\n\r\nOn the high bluffs across the river below Rock Haven are the\r\nreconstructed earth lodges of the LOOKING VILLAGE (L) of the Mandans,\r\nbelow which is the mouth (L) of BURNT CREEK (_see Side Tour 3B_).\r\n\r\nTermination of the =350 m.= voyage is made at Bismarck at a boat\r\nlanding (L) reached just after passing under the N. P. Ry. Bridge.\r\nDownstream from the landing is the LIBERTY MEMORIAL BRIDGE over which\r\npasses US 10 (_see Tour 8_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\n1682  La Salle, French explorer, by his _Procès Verbal_ claims part\r\n      of North Dakota drained by Missouri River for France.\r\n\r\n1738  Pierre de la Verendrye, first white man to enter North\r\n      Dakota, visits Mandan Indians on Missouri.\r\n\r\n1742  Verendrye's sons return to North Dakota while searching\r\n      for a western sea near high mountains.\r\n\r\n1762  France transfers land claimed by La Salle to Spain.\r\n\r\n1763  By Treaty of Paris England obtains title to part of State\r\n      drained by Mouse and Red Rivers.\r\n\r\n1768  Jonathan Carver explores Northwest through the Red River\r\n      Valley for Provincial Government.\r\n\r\n1797  David Thompson, English geographer, explores and maps\r\n      Mouse and Missouri River basins.\r\n\r\n      Charles Chaboillez of the North West Company establishes\r\n      first trading post in State at Pembina.\r\n\r\n1800  Spain cedes American possessions back to France after adjustment\r\n      of territorial holdings.\r\n\r\n      Alexander Henry, Jr., opens fur-trading post at Park River.\r\n\r\n1801  Alexander Henry, Jr., moves post to Pembina.\r\n\r\n1802  March 12, first non-Indian child in State, a girl, born to\r\n      Pierre Bonza and wife, Negroes, at Henry's post at Pembina.\r\n\r\n      Charles le Raye explores western North Dakota while captive\r\n      of Brulé Sioux.\r\n\r\n1803  Louisiana Purchase makes southwestern North Dakota part\r\n      of United States.\r\n\r\n1804-5  Lewis and Clark, accompanied by Sakakawea, cross North\r\n      Dakota on journey to Pacific.\r\n\r\n1807  In May, Manuel Lisa sets out from St. Louis in search of\r\n      suitable sites for trading posts along the Missouri River.\r\n\r\n      December 29, first white child in State born at Pembina.\r\n\r\n1811  John Bradbury and Thomas Nuttall, English botanists, join\r\n      Astoria Overland Expedition up Missouri and Yellowstone\r\n      Rivers to Oregon.\r\n\r\n1812  Selkirk colonists come to Pembina to make first attempt at\r\n      permanent white settlement in State.\r\n\r\n1818  Father Dumoulin and Father Provencher open first church\r\n      in State, a Roman Catholic mission at Pembina.\r\n\r\n      First school, taught by William Edge, begun in connection\r\n      with this mission.\r\n\r\n      United States acquires eastern North Dakota by treaty with\r\n      England.\r\n\r\n1820  Grasshopper plague destroys Red River Valley crops.\r\n\r\n1822  Gen.
