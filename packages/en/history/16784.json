Sir,\r\n\r\nThe enclosed letter came to hand by yesterday’s post. You will be\r\nsensible of the circumstances which make it improper that I should\r\nhazard a formal answer, as well as of the desire its friendly aspect\r\nnaturally excites, that those concerned in it should understand that\r\nthe spirit they express is friendly viewed. You can judge also from your\r\nknowledge of the ground, whether it may be usefully encouraged. I take\r\nthe liberty, therefore, of availing myself of your neighborhood to\r\nBoston, and of your friendship to me, to request you to say to the\r\nCaptain and others verbally whatever you think would be proper, as\r\nexpressive of my sentiments on the subject. With respect to the day\r\non which they wish to fix their anniversary, they may be told, that\r\ndisapproving myself of transferring the honors and veneration for the\r\ngreat birthday of our republic to any individual, or of dividing them\r\nwith individuals, I have declined letting my own birthday be known, and\r\nhave engaged my family not to communicate it. This has been the uniform\r\nanswer to every application of the kind.\r\n\r\nOn further consideration as to the amendment to our constitution\r\nrespecting Louisiana, I have thought it better, instead of enumerating\r\nthe powers which Congress may exercise, to give them the same powers\r\nthey have as to other portions of the Union generally, and to enumerate\r\nthe special exceptions, in some such form as the following.\r\n\r\n‘Louisiana, as ceded by France to the United States, is made a part of\r\nthe United States, its white inhabitants shall be citizens, and stand,\r\nas to their rights and obligations, on the same footing with other\r\ncitizens of the United States, in analogous situations. Save only that\r\nas to the portion thereof lying north of an east and west line drawn\r\nthrough the mouth of Arkansas river, no new State shall be established,\r\nnor any grants of land made, other than to Indians, in exchange for\r\nequivalent portions of land occupied by them, until an amendment of the\r\nconstitution shall be made for these purposes.\r\n\r\n‘Florida also, whensoever it may be rightfully obtained, shall become\r\na part of the United States, its white inhabitants shall thereupon be\r\ncitizens, and shall stand, as to their rights and obligations, on the\r\nsame footing with other citizens of the United States, in analogous\r\nsituations.’\r\n\r\nI quote this for your consideration, observing that the less that is\r\nsaid about any constitutional difficulty, the better: and that it will\r\nbe desirable for Congress to do what is necessary, in silence. I find\r\nbut one opinion as to the necessity of shutting up the country for\r\nsome time. We meet in Washington the 25th of September to prepare for\r\nCongress. Accept my affectionate salutations, and great esteem and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER II.--TO WILSON C NICHOLAS, September 7, 1803\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILSON C NICHOLAS.\r\n\r\nMonticello, September 7, 1803.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of the 3rd was delivered me at court; but we were much\r\ndisappointed at not seeing you here, Mr. Madison and the Governor being\r\nhere at the time. 1 enclose you a letter from Monroe on the subject of\r\nthe late treaty. You will observe a hint in it, to do without delay what\r\nwe are bound to do. There is reason, in the opinion of our ministers,\r\nto believe, that if the thing were to do over again, it could not be\r\nobtained, and that if we give the least opening, they will declare the\r\ntreaty void. A warning amounting to that has been given to them, and\r\nan unusual kind of letter written by their minister to our Secretary of\r\nState, direct. Whatever Congress shall think it necessary to do, should\r\nbe done with as little debate as possible, and particularly so far as\r\nrespects the constitutional difficulty. I am aware of the force of\r\nthe observations you make on the power given by the constitution to\r\nCongress, to admit new States into the Union, without restraining the\r\nsubject to the territory then constituting the United States. But when I\r\nconsider that the limits of the United States are precisely fixed by the\r\ntreaty of 1783, that the constitution expressly declares itself to be\r\nmade for the United States, I cannot help believing the intention was\r\nnot to permit Congress to admit into the Union new States, which should\r\nbe formed out of the territory for which, and under whose authority\r\nalone, they were then acting. I do not believe it was meant that they\r\nmight receive England, Ireland, Holland, &tc. into it, which would\r\nbe the case on your construction. When an instrument admits two\r\nconstructions, the one safe, the other dangerous, the one precise, the\r\nother indefinite, I prefer that which is safe and precise. I had\r\nrather ask an enlargement of power from the nation, where it is found\r\nnecessary, than to assume it by a construction which would make our\r\npowers boundless. Our peculiar security is in the possession of a\r\nwritten constitution. Let us not make it a blank paper by construction.\r\nI say the same as to the opinion of those who consider the grant of\r\nthe treaty-making power as boundless. If it is, then we have no\r\nconstitution. If it has bounds, they can be no others than the\r\ndefinitions of the powers which that instrument gives. It specifies and\r\ndelineates the operations permitted to the federal government, and gives\r\nall the powers necessary to carry these into execution. Whatever of\r\nthese enumerated objects is proper for a law, Congress may make the law;\r\nwhatever is proper to be executed by way of a treaty, the President and\r\nSenate may enter into the treaty; whatever is to be done by a judicial\r\nsentence, the judges may pass the sentence. Nothing is more likely than\r\nthat their enumeration of powers is defective. This is the ordinary case\r\nof all human works. Let us go on then perfecting it, by adding, by way\r\nof amendment to the constitution, those powers which time and trial show\r\nare still wanting. But it has been taken too much for granted, that by\r\nthis rigorous construction the treaty power would be reduced to nothing.\r\nI had occasion once to examine its effect on the French treaty, made by\r\nthe old Congress, and found that out of thirty odd articles which that\r\ncontained, there were one, two, or three only, which could not now be\r\nstipulated under our present constitution. I confess, then, I think\r\nit important, in the present case, to set an example against broad\r\nconstruction, by appealing for new power to the people. If, however,\r\nour friends shall think differently, certainly I shall acquiesce with\r\nsatisfaction; confiding, that the good sense of our country will correct\r\nthe evil of construction when it shall produce ill effects.\r\n\r\nNo apologies for writing or speaking to me freely are necessary. On the\r\ncontrary, nothing my friends can do is so dear to me, and proves to me\r\ntheir friendship so clearly, as the information they give me of their\r\nsentiments and those of others on interesting points where I am to act,\r\nand where information and warning is so essential to excite in me that\r\ndue reflection which ought to precede action. I leave this about the\r\n21st, and shall hope the District Court will give me an opportunity\r\nof seeing you. Accept my affectionate salutations, and assurances of\r\ncordial esteem and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER III.--TO DOCTOR BENJAMIN RUSH, October 4, 1803\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR BENJAMIN RUSH.\r\n\r\nWashington, October 4, 1803.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nNo one would more willingly than myself pay the just tribute due to\r\nthe services of Captain Barry, by writing a letter of condolence to his\r\nwidow, as you suggest. But when one undertakes to administer justice,\r\nit must be with an even hand, and by rule; what is done for one, must be\r\ndone for every one in equal degree. To what a train of attentions\r\nwould this draw a President? How difficult would it be to draw the line\r\nbetween that degree of merit entitled to such a testimonial of it, and\r\nthat not so entitled? If drawn in a particular case differently from\r\nwhat the friends of the deceased would judge right, what offence would\r\nit give, and of the most tender kind? How much offence would be given\r\nby accidental inattentions, or want of information? The first step\r\ninto such an undertaking ought to be well weighed. On the death of Dr.\r\nFranklin, the King and Convention of France went into mourning. So did\r\nthe House of Representatives of the United States: the Senate refused.\r\nI proposed to General Washington that the executive departments should\r\nwear mourning; he declined it, because he said he should not know where\r\nto draw the line, if he once began that ceremony. Mr. Adams was then\r\nVice-President, and I thought General Washington had his eye on him,\r\nwhom he certainly did not love. I told him the world had drawn so\r\nbroad a line between himself and Dr. Franklin, on the one side, and the\r\nresidue of mankind, on the other, that we might wear mourning for them,\r\nand the question still remain new and undecided as to all others. He\r\nthought it best, however, to avoid it. On these considerations alone,\r\nhowever well affected to the merit of Commodore Barry, I think\r\nit prudent not to engage myself in a practice which may become\r\nembarrassing.\r\n\r\nTremendous times in Europe! How mighty this battle of lions and tigers?\r\nWith what sensations should the common herd of cattle look on it? With\r\nno partialities certainly. If they can so far worry one another as to\r\ndestroy their power of tyrannizing the one over the earth, the other the\r\nwaters, the world may perhaps enjoy peace, till they recruit again.\r\n\r\nAffectionate and respectful salutations.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER IV.--TO M. DUPONT DE NEMOURS, November 1, 1803\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DUPONT DE NEMOURS.\r\n\r\nWashington, November 1, 1803.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favors of April the 6th and June the 27th were duly received, and\r\nwith the welcome which every thing brings from you. The treaty which has\r\nso happily sealed the friendship of our two countries, has been received\r\nhere with general acclamation. Some inflexible federalists have still\r\nventured to brave the public opinion. It will fix their character with\r\nthe world and with posterity, who, not descending to the other points of\r\ndifference between us, will judge them by this fact, so palpable as to\r\nspeak for itself, in all times and places. For myself and my country I\r\nthank you for the aids you have given in it; and I congratulate you on\r\nhaving lived to give those aids in a transaction replete with blessings\r\nto unborn millions of men, and which will mark the face of a portion on\r\nthe globe so extensive as that which now composes the United States of\r\nAmerica. It is true that at this moment a little cloud hovers in the\r\nhorizon. The government of Spain has protested against the right of\r\nFrance to transfer; and it is possible she may refuse possession, and\r\nthat this may bring on acts of force. But against such neighbors as\r\nFrance there, and the United States here, what she can expect from so\r\ngross a compound of folly and false faith, is not to be sought in the\r\nbook of wisdom. She is afraid of her enemies in Mexico. But not more\r\nthan we are. Our policy will be to form New Orleans and the country on\r\nboth sides of it on the Gulf of Mexico, into a State; and, as to all\r\nabove that, to transplant our Indians into it, constituting them a\r\nMarechaussee to prevent emigrants crossing the river, until we shall\r\nhave filled up all the vacant country on this side. This will secure\r\nboth Spain and us as to the mines of Mexico, for half a century, and we\r\nmay safely trust the provisions for that time to the men who shall live\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nI have communicated with Mr. Gallatin on the subject of using your\r\nhouse in any matters of consequence we may have to do at Paris. He\r\nis impressed with the same desire I feel to give this mark of our\r\nconfidence in you, and the sense we entertain of your friendship and\r\nfidelity. Mr. Behring informs him that none of the money which will be\r\ndue from us to him, as the assignee of France, will be wanting at Paris.\r\nBe assured that our dispositions are such as to let no occasion pass\r\nunimproved, of serving you, where occurrences will permit it.\r\n\r\nPresent my respects to Madame Dupont, and accept yourself assurances of\r\nmy constant and warm friendship.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER V.--TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON, November 4,1803\r\n\r\nTO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON.\r\n\r\nWashington, November 4,1803.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nA report reaches us this day from Baltimore (on probable, but not\r\ncertain grounds), that Mr. Jerome Bonaparte, brother of the First\r\nConsul, was yesterday* married to Miss Patterson of that city. The\r\neffect of this measure on the mind of the First Consul, is not for me to\r\nsuppose; but as it might occur to him _primâ facie_, that the executive\r\nof the United States ought to have prevented it, I have thought it\r\nadvisable to mention the subject to you, that if necessary, you may by\r\nexplanations set that idea to rights. You know that by our laws, all\r\npersons are free to enter into marriage, if of twenty-one years of age,\r\nno one having a power to restrain it, not even their parents; and that\r\nunder that age, no one can prevent it but the parent or guardian. The\r\nlady is under age, and the parents, placed between her affections\r\nwhich were strongly fixed, and the considerations opposing the measure,\r\nyielded with pain and anxiety to the former.\r\n\r\n     * November 8. It is now said that it did not take place on\r\n     the 3rd, but will this day.\r\n\r\nMr. Patterson is the President of the bank of Baltimore, the wealthiest\r\nman in Maryland, perhaps in the United States, except Mr. Carroll; a man\r\nof great virtue and respectability; the mother is the sister of the lady\r\nof General Samuel Smith; and, consequently, the station of the family in\r\nsociety is with the first of the United States. These circumstances fix\r\nrank in a country where there are no hereditary titles. Your treaty has\r\nobtained nearly a general approbation. The federalists spoke and voted\r\nagainst it, but they are now so reduced in their numbers as to be\r\nnothing. The question on its ratification in the Senate was decided by\r\ntwenty-four against seven, which was ten more than enough. The vote in\r\nthe House of Representatives for making provision for its execution,\r\nwas carried by eighty-nine against twenty-three, which was a majority\r\nof sixty-six, and the necessary bills are going through the Houses\r\nby greater majorities. Mr. Pichon, according to instructions from his\r\ngovernment, proposed to have added to the ratification a protestation\r\nagainst any failure in time or other circumstances of execution, on\r\nour part. He was told, that in that case we should annex a counter\r\nprotestation, which would leave the thing exactly where it was; that\r\nthis transaction had been conducted from the commencement of the\r\nnegotiation to this stage of it, with a frankness and sincerity\r\nhonorable to both nations, and comfortable to the heart of an honest man\r\nto review; that to annex to this last chapter of the transaction such an\r\nevidence of mutual distrust, was to change its aspect dishonorably\r\nfor us both, and contrary to truth as to us; for that we had not the\r\nsmallest doubt that France would punctually execute its part; and I\r\nassured Mr. Pichon that I had more confidence in the word of the First\r\nConsul than in all the parchment we could sign. He saw that we had\r\nratified the treaty; that both branches had passed by great majorities\r\none of the bills for execution, and would soon pass the other two;\r\nthat no circumstances remained that could leave a doubt of our punctual\r\nperformance; and like an able and an honest minister (which he is in the\r\nhighest degree) he undertook to do, what he knew his employers would do\r\nthemselves, were they here spectators of all the existing circumstances,\r\nand exchanged the ratification’s purely and simply; so that this\r\ninstrument goes to the world as an evidence of the candor and confidence\r\nof the nations in each other, which will have the best effects. This was\r\nthe more justifiable, as Mr. Pichon knew that Spain had entered with us\r\na protestation against our ratification of the treaty, grounded, first,\r\non the assertion that the First Consul had not executed the conditions\r\nof the treaties of cession, and secondly, that he had broken a solemn\r\npromise not to alienate the country to any nation. We answered, that\r\nthese were private questions between France and Spain, which they must\r\nsettle together; that we derived our title from the First Consul, and\r\ndid not doubt his guarantee of it: and we, four days ago, sent off\r\norders to the Governor of the Mississippi territory and General\r\nWilkinson, to move down with the troops at hand to New Orleans, to\r\nreceive the possession from Mr. Laussat. If he is heartily disposed to\r\ncarry the order of the Consul into execution, he can probably command a\r\nvolunteer force at New Orleans, and will have the aid of ours also, if\r\nhe desires it, to take the possession and deliver it to us. If he is\r\nnot so disposed, we shall take the possession, and it will rest with the\r\ngovernment of France, by adopting the act as their own and obtaining the\r\nconfirmation of Spain, to supply the non-execution of their stipulation\r\nto deliver, and to entitle themselves to the complete execution of our\r\npart of the agreements. In the mean time, the legislature is passing the\r\nbills, and we are preparing every thing to be done on our part towards\r\nexecution, and we shall not avail ourselves of the three months’ delay\r\nafter possession of the province, allowed by the treaty for the delivery\r\nof the stock, but shall deliver it the moment that possession is known\r\nhere, which will be on the eighteenth day after it has taken place.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nAccept my affectionate salutations, and assurances of my constant esteem\r\nand respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VI.--TO DAVID WILLIAMS, November 14, 1803\r\n\r\nTO DAVID WILLIAMS.\r\n\r\nWashington, November 14, 1803.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have duly received the volume on the claims of literature; which\r\nyou did me the favor to send me through Mr. Monroe: and have read\r\nwith satisfaction the many judicious reflections it contains, on the\r\ncondition of the respectable class of literary men. The efforts for\r\ntheir relief, made by a society of private citizens, are truly laudable:\r\nbut they are, as you justly observe, but a palliation of an evil, the\r\ncure of which calls for all the wisdom and the means of the nation. The\r\ngreatest evils of populous society have ever appeared to me to spring\r\nfrom the vicious distribution of its members among the occupations\r\ncalled for. I have no doubt that those nations are essentially\r\nright, which leave this to individual choice, as a better guide to an\r\nadvantageous distribution, than any other which could be devised.\r\nBut when, by a blind concourse, particular occupations are ruinously\r\novercharged, and others left in want of hands, the national authorities\r\ncan do much towards restoring the equilibrium. On the revival of\r\nletters, learning became the universal favorite. And with reason,\r\nbecause there was not enough of it existing to manage the affairs of\r\na nation to the best advantage, nor to advance its individuals to the\r\nhappiness of which they were susceptible, by improvements in their\r\nminds, their morals, their health, and in those conveniences which\r\ncontribute to the comfort and embellishment of life. All the efforts of\r\nthe society, therefore, were directed to the increase of learning,\r\nand the inducements of respect, ease, and profit were held up for its\r\nencouragement. Even the charities of the nation forgot that misery was\r\ntheir object, and spent themselves in founding schools to transfer to\r\nscience the hardy sons of the plough. To these incitements were added\r\nthe powerful fascinations of great cities. These circumstances have long\r\nsince produced an overcharge in the class of competitors for learned\r\noccupation, and great distress among the supernumerary candidates; and\r\nthe more, as their habits of life have disqualified them for re-entering\r\ninto the laborious class. The evil cannot be suddenly, nor perhaps ever\r\nentirely cured: nor should I presume to say by what means it may be\r\ncured. Doubtless there are many engines which the nation might bring to\r\nbear on this object. Public opinion and public encouragement are among\r\nthese. The class principally defective is that of agriculture. It is\r\nthe first in utility, and ought to be the first in respect. The same\r\nartificial means which have been used to produce a competition in\r\nlearning, may be equally successful in restoring agriculture to its\r\nprimary dignity in the eyes of men. It is a science of the very first\r\norder. It counts among its handmaids the most respectable sciences,\r\nsuch as Chemistry, Natural Philosophy, Mechanics, Mathematics\r\ngenerally, Natural History, Botany. In every College and University, a\r\nprofessorship of agriculture, and the class of its students, might be\r\nhonored as the first. Young men closing their academical education with\r\nthis, as the crown of all other sciences, fascinated with its solid\r\ncharms, and at a time when they are to choose an occupation, instead of\r\ncrowding the other classes, would return to the farms of their fathers,\r\ntheir own, or those of others, and replenish and invigorate a calling,\r\nnow languishing under contempt and oppression. The charitable schools,\r\ninstead of storing their pupils with a lore which the present state of\r\nsociety does not call for, converted into schools of agriculture, might\r\nrestore them to that branch, qualified to enrich and honor themselves,\r\nand to increase the productions of the nation instead of consuming them.\r\nA gradual abolition of the useless offices, so much accumulated in all\r\ngovernments, might close this drain also from the labors of the field,\r\nand lessen the burthens imposed on them. By these, and the better means\r\nwhich will occur to others, the surcharge of the learned, might in\r\ntime be drawn off to recruit the laboring class of citizenss the sum of\r\nindustry be increased, and that of misery diminished.\r\n\r\nAmong the ancients, the redundance of population was sometimes checked\r\nby exposing infants. To the moderns, America has offered a more humane\r\nresource. Many, who cannot find employment in Europe, accordingly come\r\nhere. Those who can labor do well, for the most part. Of the learned\r\nclass of emigrants, a small portion find employments analogous to their\r\ntalents. But many fail, and return to complete their course of misery in\r\nthe scenes where it began. Even here we find too strong a current from\r\nthe country to the towns; and instances beginning to appear of that\r\nspecies of misery, which you are so humanely endeavoring to relieve with\r\nyou. Although we have in the old countries of Europe the lesson of their\r\nexperience to warn us, yet I am not satisfied we shall have the firmness\r\nand wisdom to profit by it. The general desire of men to live by their\r\nheads rather than their hands, and the strong allurements of great\r\ncities to those who have any turn for dissipation, threaten to make them\r\nhere, as in Europe, the sinks of voluntary misery. I perceive, however,\r\nthat I have suffered my pen to run into a disquisition, when I had taken\r\nit up only to thank you for the volume you had been so kind as to send\r\nme, and to express my approbation of it. After apologizing, therefore,\r\nfor having touched on a subject so much more familiar to you, and better\r\nunderstood, I beg leave to assure you of my high consideration and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VII.--TO JOHN RANDOLH, December 1, 1803\r\n\r\nTO JOHN RANDOLH.\r\n\r\nWashington, December 1, 1803.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nThe explanations in your letter of yesterday were quite unnecessary to\r\nme. I have had too satisfactory proofs of your friendly regard, to be\r\ndisposed to suspect any thing of a contrary aspect.\r\n\r\nI understood perfectly the expressions stated in the newspaper to\r\nwhich you allude, to mean, that ‘though the proposition came from the\r\nrepublican quarter of the House, yet you should not concur with it.’ I\r\nam aware, that in parts of the Union, and even with persons to whom Mr.\r\nEppes and Mr. Randolph are unknown, and myself little known, it will be\r\npresumed from their connection, that what comes from them comes from me.\r\nNo men on earth are more independent in their sentiments than they are,\r\nnor any one less disposed than I am to influence the opinions of others.\r\nWe rarely speak of politics, or of the proceedings of the House, but\r\nmerely historically; and I carefully avoid expressing an opinion on them\r\nin their presence, that we may all be at our ease. With other members, I\r\nhave believed that more unreserved communications would be advantageous\r\nto the public. This has been, perhaps, prevented by mutual delicacy. I\r\nhave been afraid to express opinions unasked, lest I should be suspected\r\nof wishing to direct the legislative action of members. They have\r\navoided asking communications from me, probably, lest they should be\r\nsuspected of wishing to fish out executive secrets. I see too many\r\nproofs of the imperfection of human reason, to entertain wonder or\r\nintolerance at any difference of opinion on any subject; and acquiesce\r\nin that difference as easily as on a difference of feature or form:\r\nexperience having long taught me the reasonableness of mutual sacrifices\r\nof opinion among those who are to act together for any common object,\r\nand the expediency of doing what good we can, when we cannot do all we\r\nwould wish.\r\n\r\nAccept my friendly salutations, and assurances of great esteem and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VIII.--TO MR. GALLATIN, December 13, 1803\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON TO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney General having considered and decided, that the\r\nprescription in the law for establishing a bank, that the officers in\r\nthe subordinate offices of discount and deposit, shall be appointed ‘on\r\nthe same terms and in the same manner practised in the principal bank,’\r\ndoes not extend to them the principle of rotation, established by the\r\nlegislature in the body of directors in the principal bank, it follows\r\nthat the extension of that principle has been merely a voluntary and\r\nprudential act of the principal bank, from which they are free to\r\ndepart. I think the extension was wise and proper on their part, because\r\nthe legislature having deemed rotation useful in the principal bank\r\nconstituted by them, there would be the same reason for it in the\r\nsubordinate banks to be established by the principal. It breaks in upon\r\nthe _esprit de corps_, so apt to prevail in permanent bodies; it gives\r\na chance for the public eye penetrating into the sanctuary of those\r\nproceedings and practices, which the avarice of the directors may\r\nintroduce for their personal emolument, and which the resentments of\r\nexcluded directors, or the honesty of those duly admitted, might betray\r\nto the public; and it gives an opportunity at the end of the year, or at\r\nother periods, of correcting a choice, which, on trial, proves to have\r\nbeen unfortunate; an evil of which themselves complain in their distant\r\ninstitutions. Whether, however, they have a power to alter this or not,\r\nthe executive has no right to decide; and their consultation with you\r\nhas been merely an act of complaisance, or from a desire to shield so\r\nimportant an innovation under the cover of executive sanction. But\r\nought we to volunteer our sanction in such a case? Ought we to disarm\r\nourselves of any fair right of animadversion, whenever that institution\r\nshall be a legitimate subject of consideration? I own I think the most\r\nproper answer would be, that we do not think ourselves authorized to\r\ngive an opinion on the question.\r\n\r\nFrom a passage in the letter of the President, I observe an idea of\r\nestablishing a branch bank of the United States in New Orleans. This\r\ninstitution is one of the most deadly hostility existing, against the\r\nprinciples and form of our constitution. The nation is, at this time,\r\nso strong and united in its sentiments, that it cannot be shaken at this\r\nmoment. But suppose a series of untoward events should occur, sufficient\r\nto bring into doubt the competency of a republican government to meet\r\na crisis of great danger, or to unhinge the confidence of the people in\r\nthe public functionaries; an institution like this, penetrating by its\r\nbranches every part of the Union, acting by command and in phalanx, may,\r\nin a critical moment, upset the government. I deem no government safe\r\nwhich is under the vassalage of any self-constituted authorities, or any\r\nother authority than that of the nation, or its regular functionaries.\r\nWhat an obstruction could not this bank of the United States, with all\r\nits branch banks, be in time of war? It might dictate to us the peace\r\nwe should accept, or withdraw its aids. Ought we then to give further\r\ngrowth to an institution so powerful, so hostile? That it is so hostile\r\nwe know, 1. from a knowledge of the principles of the persons composing\r\nthe body of directors in every bank, principal or branch; and those of\r\nmost of the stock-holders: 2. from their opposition to the measures and\r\nprinciples of the government, and to the election of those friendly to\r\nthem: and, 3. from the sentiments of the newspapers they support. Now,\r\nwhile we are strong, it is the greatest duty we owe to the safety of our\r\nconstitution, to bring this powerful enemy to a perfect subordination\r\nunder its authorities. The first measure would be to reduce them to an\r\nequal footing only with other banks, as to the favors of the government.\r\nBut, in order to be able to meet a general combination of the banks\r\nagainst us, in a critical emergency, could we not make a beginning\r\ntowards an independent use of our own money, towards holding our own\r\nbank in all the deposits where it is received, and letting the Treasurer\r\ngive his draft or note for payment at any particular place, which, in a\r\nwell conducted government, ought to have as much credit as any private\r\ndraft, or bank note, or bill, and would give us the same facilities\r\nwhich we derive from the banks? I pray you to turn this subject in your\r\nmind, and to give it the benefit of your knowledge of details; whereas,\r\nI have only very general views of the subject. Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\nWashington, December 13, 1803.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER IX.--TO DOCTOR PRIESTLEY, January 29, 1804\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR PRIESTLEY.\r\n\r\nWashington, January 29, 1804.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of December the 12th came duly to hand, as did the second\r\nletter to Doctor Linn, and the treatise on Phlogiston, for which I pray\r\nyou to accept my thanks. The copy for Mr. Livingston has been delivered,\r\ntogether with your letter to him, to Mr. Harvie, my secretary, who\r\ndeparts in a day or two for Paris, and will deliver them himself to Mr.\r\nLivingston, whose attention to your matter cannot be doubted. I have\r\nalso to add my thanks to Mr. Priestley, your son, for the copy of your\r\nHarmony, which I have gone through with great satisfaction. It is\r\nthe first I have been able to meet with, which is clear of those long\r\nrepetitions of the same transaction, as if it were a different one\r\nbecause related with some different circumstances.\r\n\r\nI rejoice that you have undertaken the task of comparing the moral\r\ndoctrines of Jesus with those of the ancient Philosophers. You are so\r\nmuch in possession of the whole subject, that you will do it easier and\r\nbetter than any other person living. I think you cannot avoid giving,\r\nas preliminary to the comparison, a digest of his moral doctrines,\r\nextracted in his own words from the Evangelists, and leaving out every\r\nthing relative to his personal history and character. It would be short\r\nand precious. With a view to do this for my own satisfaction, I had sent\r\nto Philadelphia to get two Testaments (Greek) of the same edition, and\r\ntwo English, with a design to cut out the morsels of morality, and paste\r\nthem on the leaves of a book, in the manner you describe as having been\r\npursued in forming your Harmony. But I shall now get the thing done by\r\nbetter hands.\r\n\r\nI very early saw that Louisiana was indeed a speck in our horizon, which\r\nwas to burst in a tornado; and the public are un-apprized how near this\r\ncatastrophe was. Nothing but a frank and friendly developement of causes\r\nand effects on our part, and good sense enough in Bonaparte to see that\r\nthe train was unavoidable, and would change the face of the world, saved\r\nus from that storm. I did not expect he would yield till a war took\r\nplace between France and England, and my hope was to palliate and\r\nendure, if Messrs. Ross, Morris, &c. did not force a premature rupture\r\nuntil that event. I believed the event not very distant, but acknowledge\r\nit came on sooner than I had expected. Whether, however, the good sense\r\nof Bonaparte might not see the course predicted to be necessary and\r\nunavoidable, even before a war should be imminent, was a chance which\r\nwe thought it our duty to try: but the immediate prospect of rupture\r\nbrought the case to immediate decision. The denouement has been happy:\r\nand I confess I look to this duplication of area for the extending a\r\ngovernment so free and economical as ours, as a great achievement to\r\nthe mass of happiness which is to ensue. Whether we remain in one\r\nconfederacy, or form into Atlantic and Mississippi confederacies, I\r\nbelieve not very important to the happiness of either part. Those of\r\nthe western confederacy will be as much our children and descendants\r\nas those of the eastern, and I feel myself as much identified with\r\nthat country, in future time, as with this: and did I now foresee a\r\nseparation at some future day, yet I should feel the duty and the desire\r\nto promote the western interests as zealously as the eastern, doing all\r\nthe good for both portions of our future family which should fall within\r\nmy power.\r\n\r\nHave you seen the new work of Malthus on Population? It is one of the\r\nablest I have ever seen. Although his main object is to delineate\r\nthe effects of redundancy of population, and to test the poor laws\r\nof England, and other palliations for that evil, several important\r\nquestions in political economy, allied to his subject incidentally, are\r\ntreated with a masterly hand. It is a single octavo volume, and I have\r\nbeen only able to read a borrowed copy, the only one I have yet heard\r\nof. Probably our friends in England will think of you, and give you an\r\nopportunity of reading it.\r\n\r\nAccept my affectionate salutations, and assurances of great esteem and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER X.--TO ELBRIDGE GERRY, March 3, 1804\r\n\r\nTO ELBRIDGE GERRY.\r\n\r\nWashington, March 3, 1804.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nAlthough it is long since I received your favor of October the 27th,\r\nyet I have not had leisure sooner to acknowledge it. In the Middle and\r\nSouthern States, as great an union of sentiment has now taken place\r\nas is perhaps desirable. For as there will always be an opposition, I\r\nbelieve it had better be from avowed monarchists than republicans. New\r\nYork seems to be in danger of republican division; Vermont is solidly\r\nwith us; Rhode Island with us on anomalous grounds; New Hampshire on\r\nthe verge of the republican shore; Connecticut advancing towards it very\r\nslowly, but with steady step; your State only uncertain of making port\r\nat all. I had forgotten Delaware, which will be always uncertain\r\nfrom the divided character of her citizens. If the amendment of the\r\nconstitution passes Rhode Island (and we expect to hear in a day or\r\ntwo), the election for the ensuing four years seems to present nothing\r\nformidable. I sincerely regret that the unbounded calumnies of the\r\nfederal party have obliged me to throw myself on the verdict of my\r\ncountry for trial, my great desire having been to retire at the end\r\nof the present term, to a life of tranquillity; and it was my decided\r\npurpose when I entered into office. They force my continuance. If we\r\ncan keep the vessel of State as steadily in her course for another four\r\nyears, my earthly purposes will be accomplished, and I shall be free\r\nto enjoy, as you are doing, my family, my farm, and my books. That your\r\nenjoyments may continue as long as you shall wish them, I sincerely\r\npray, and tender you my friendly salutations, and assurances of great\r\nrespect and esteem.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XI.--TO GIDEON GRANGER, April 16, 1804\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GIDEON GRANGER.\r\n\r\nMonticello, April 16, 1804.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nIn our last conversation you mentioned a federal scheme afloat, of\r\nforming a coalition between the federalists and republicans, of what\r\nthey called the seven eastern States. The idea was new to me, and after\r\ntime for reflection, I had no opportunity of conversing with you again.\r\nThe federalists know that, _eo nomine_, they are gone for ever. Their\r\nobject, therefore, is, how to return into power under some other form.\r\nUndoubtedly they have but one means, which is to divide the republicans,\r\njoin the minority, and barter with them for the cloak of their name.\r\nI say, join the minority; because the majority of the republicans, not\r\nneeding them, will not buy them. The minority, having no other means of\r\nruling the majority, will give a price for auxiliaries, and that price\r\nmust be principle. It is true that the federalists, needing their\r\nnumbers also, must also give a price, and principle is the coin they\r\nmust pay in. Thus a bastard system of federo-republicanism will rise on\r\nthe ruins of the true principles of our revolution. And when this party\r\nis formed, who will constitute the majority of it, which majority is\r\nthen to dictate? Certainly the federalists. Thus their proposition of\r\nputting themselves into gear with the republican minority, is exactly\r\nlike Roger Sherman’s proposition to add Connecticut to Rhode Island.\r\nThe idea of forming seven eastern States is moreover clearly to form the\r\nbasis of a separation of the Union. Is it possible that real republicans\r\ncan be gulled by such a bait? And for what? What do they wish, that they\r\nhave not? Federal measures? That is impossible. Republican measures?\r\nHave they them not? Can any one deny, that in all important questions\r\nof principle, republicanism prevails? But do they want that their\r\nindividual will shall govern the majority? They may purchase the\r\ngratification of this unjust wish, for a little time, at a great price;\r\nbut the federalists must not have the passions of other men, if, after\r\ngetting thus into the seat of power, they suffer themselves to be\r\ngoverned by their minority. This minority may say, that whenever they\r\nrelapse into their own principles, they will quit them, and draw the\r\nseat from under them. They may quit them, indeed, but, in the mean time,\r\nall the venal will have become associated with them, and will give them\r\na majority sufficient to keep them in place, and to enable them to eject\r\nthe heterogeneous friends by whose aid they get again into power. I\r\ncannot believe any portion of real republicans will enter into this\r\ntrap; and if they do, I do not believe they can carry with them the mass\r\nof their States, advancing so steadily as we see them, to an union of\r\nprinciple with their brethren. It will be found in this, as in all\r\nother similar cases, that crooked schemes will end by overwhelming their\r\nauthors and coadjutors in disgrace, and that he alone who walks strict\r\nand upright, and who in matters of opinion will be contented that others\r\nshould be as free as himself, and acquiesce when his opinion is fairly\r\noverruled, will attain his object in the end. And that this may be\r\nthe conduct of us all, I offer my sincere prayers, as well as for your\r\nhealth and happiness.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XII.--TO MRS. ADAMS, June 13,1804\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. ADAMS.\r\n\r\nWashington, June 13,1804.\r\n\r\nDear Madam,\r\n\r\nThe affectionate sentiments which you have had the goodness to express\r\nin your letter of May the 20th, towards my dear departed daughter, have\r\nawakened in me sensibilities natural to the occasion, and recalled\r\nyour kindnesses to her, which I shall ever remember with gratitude and\r\nfriendship. I can assure you with truth, they had made an indelible\r\nimpression on her mind, and that to the last, on our meetings after long\r\nseparations, whether I had heard lately of you, and how you did, were\r\namong the earliest of her inquiries. In giving you this assurance, I\r\nperform a sacred duty for her, and, at the same time, am thankful for\r\nthe occasion furnished me, of expressing my regret that circumstances\r\nshould have arisen, which have seemed to draw a line of separation\r\nbetween us. The friendship with which you honored me has ever been\r\nvalued, and fully reciprocated; and although events have been passing\r\nwhich might be trying to some minds, I never believed yours to be\r\nof that kind, nor felt that my own was. Neither my estimate of your\r\ncharacter, nor the esteem founded in that, has ever been lessened for a\r\nsingle moment, although doubts whether it would be acceptable may have\r\nforbidden manifestations of it.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams’s friendship and mine began at an earlier date. It accompanied\r\nus through long and important scenes. The different conclusions we had\r\ndrawn from our political reading and reflections, were not permitted to\r\nlessen mutual esteem; each party being conscious they were the result of\r\nan honest conviction in the other. Like differences of opinion existing\r\namong our fellow citizens, attached them to the one or the other of us,\r\nand produced a rivalship in their minds which did not exist in ours. We\r\nnever stood in one another’s way. For if either had been withdrawn at\r\nany time, his favorers would not have gone over to the other, but would\r\nhave sought for some one of homogeneous opinions. This consideration\r\nwas sufficient to keep down all jealousy between us, and to guard our\r\nfriendship from any disturbance by sentiments of rivalship: and I can\r\nsay with truth, that one act of Mr. Adams’s life, and one only, ever\r\ngave me a moment’s personal displeasure. I did consider his last\r\nappointments to office as personally unkind. They were from among my\r\nmost ardent political enemies, from whom no faithful co-operation could\r\never be expected; and laid me under the embarrassment of acting through\r\nmen, whose views were to defeat mine, or to encounter the odium of\r\nputting others in their places. It seems but common justice to leave a\r\nsuccessor free to act by instruments of his own choice. If my respect\r\nfor him did not permit me to ascribe the whole blame to the influence of\r\nothers, it left something for friendship to forgive, and after brooding\r\nover it for some little time, and not always resisting the expression of\r\nit, I forgave it cordially, and returned to the same state of esteem\r\nand respect for him which had so long subsisted. Having come into life\r\na little later than Mr. Adams, his career has preceded mine, as mine\r\nis followed by some other; and it will probably be closed at the same\r\ndistance after him which time originally placed between us. I maintain\r\nfor him, and shall carry into private life, an uniform and high measure\r\nof respect and good will, and for yourself a sincere attachment.\r\n\r\nI have thus, my dear Madam, opened myself to you without reserve, which\r\nI have long wished an opportunity of doing; and without knowing how it\r\nwill be received, I feal[sp.] relief from being unbosomed. And I have\r\nnow only to entreat your forgiveness for this transition from a subject\r\nof domestic affliction, to one which seems of a different aspect. But\r\nthough connected with political events, it has been viewed by me most\r\nstrongly in its unfortunate bearings on my private friendships. The\r\ninjury these have sustained has been a heavy price for what has never\r\ngiven me equal pleasure. That you may both be favored with health,\r\ntranquillity, and long life, is the prayer of one who tenders you the\r\nassurance of his highest consideration and esteem.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XIII.--TO GOVERNOR PAGE, June 25, 1804\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR PAGE.\r\n\r\nWashington, June 25, 1804.\r\n\r\nYour letter, my dear friend, of the 25th ultimo, is a new proof of\r\nthe goodness of your heart, and the part you take in my loss marks an\r\naffectionate concern for the greatness of it. It is great indeed. Others\r\nmay lose of their abundance, but I, of my want, have lost even the half\r\nof all I had. My evening prospects now hang on the slender thread of\r\na single life. Perhaps I maybe destined to see even this last cord of\r\nparental affection broken! The hope with which I had looked forward\r\nto the moment, when, resigning public cares to younger hands, I was to\r\nretire to that domestic comfort from which the last great step is to be\r\ntaken, is fearfully blighted. When you and I look back on the country\r\nover which we have passed, what a field of slaughter does it exhibit!\r\nWhere are all the friends who entered it with us, under all the\r\ninspiring energies of health and hope? As if pursued by the havoc of\r\nwar, they are strewed by the way, some earlier, some later, and scarce\r\na few stragglers remain to count the numbers fallen, and to mark yet,\r\nby their own fall, the last footsteps of their party. Is it a desirable\r\nthing to bear up through the heat of the action to witness the death of\r\nall our companions, and merely be the last victim? I doubt it. We have,\r\nhowever, the traveller’s consolation. Every step shortens the distance\r\nwe have to go; the end of our journey is in sight, the bed wherein we\r\nare to rest, and to rise in the midst of the friends we have lost. ‘We\r\nsorrow not, then, as others who have no hope’; but look forward to the\r\nday which ‘joins us to the great majority.’ But whatever is to be our\r\ndestiny, wisdom, as well as duty, dictates that we should acquiesce in\r\nthe will of Him whose it is to give and take away, and be contented in\r\nthe enjoyment of those who are still permitted to be with us. Of those\r\nconnected by blood, the number does not depend on us. But friends we\r\nhave, if we have merited them. Those of our earliest years stand nearest\r\nin our affections. But in this too, you and I have been unlucky. Of our\r\ncollege friends (and they are the dearest) how few have stood with us in\r\nthe great political questions which have agitated our country: and these\r\nwere of a nature to justify agitation. I did not believe the Lilliputian\r\nfetters of that day strong enough to have bound so many. Will not Mrs.\r\nPage, yourself, and family, think it prudent to seek a healthier region\r\nfor the months of August and September? And may we not flatter ourselves\r\nthat you will cast your eye on Monticello? We have not many summers\r\nto live. While fortune places us then within striking distance, let us\r\navail ourselves of it, to meet and talk over the tales of other times.\r\n\r\nPresent me respectfully to Mrs. Page, and accept yourself my friendly\r\nsalutations, and assurances of constant affection.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER, XIV.--TO P. MAZZEI, July 18, 1804\r\n\r\n\r\nTO P. MAZZEI.\r\n\r\nWashington, July 18, 1804.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nIt is very long, I know, since I wrote you. So constant is the pressure\r\nof business that there is never a moment, scarcely, that something\r\nof public importance is not waiting for me. I have, therefore, on a\r\nprinciple of conscience, thought it my duty to withdraw almost entirely\r\nfrom all private correspondence, and chiefly the trans-Atlantic;\r\nI scarcely write a letter a year to any friend beyond sea. Another\r\nconsideration has led to this, which is the liability of my letters to\r\nmiscarry, be opened, and made ill use of. Although the great body of our\r\ncountry are perfectly returned to their ancient principles, yet there\r\nremains a phalanx of old tories and monarchists, more envenomed, as all\r\ntheir hopes become more desperate. Every word of mine which they can get\r\nhold of, however innocent, however orthodox even, is twisted, tormented,\r\nperverted, and, like the words of holy writ, are made to mean every\r\nthing but what they were intended to mean. I trust little, therefore,\r\nunnecessarily in their way, and especially on political subjects. I\r\nshall not, therefore, be free to answer all the several articles of your\r\nletters.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of treaties, our system is to have none with any nation,\r\nas far as can be avoided. The treaty with England has therefore, not\r\nbeen renewed, and all overtures for treaty with other nations have been\r\ndeclined. We believe, that with nations as with individuals, dealings\r\nmay be carried on as anvantageously[sp.], perhaps more so, while their\r\ncontinuance depends on a voluntary good treatment, as if fixed by a\r\ncontract, which, when it becomes injurious to either, is made, by forced\r\nconstructions, to mean what suits them, and becomes a cause of war\r\ninstead of a bond of peace.\r\n\r\nWe wish to be on the closest terms of friendship with Naples, and we\r\nwill prove it by giving to her citizens, vessels, and goods all the\r\nprivileges of the most favored nation; and while we do this voluntarily,\r\nwe cannot doubt they will voluntarily do the same for us. Our interests\r\nagainst the Barbaresques being also the same, we have little doubt she\r\nwill give us every facility to insure them, which our situation may ask\r\nand hers admit. It is not, then, from a want of friendship that we do\r\nnot propose a treaty with Naples, but because it is against our system\r\nto embarrass ourselves with treaties, or to entangle ourselves at\r\nall with the affairs of Europe. The kind offices we receive from that\r\ngovernment are more sensibly felt, as such, than they would be, if\r\nrendered only as due to us by treaty.\r\n\r\nFive fine frigates left the Chesapeake the 1st instant for Tripoli,\r\nwhich, in addition to the force now there, will, I trust, recover the\r\ncredit which Commodore Morris’s two years’ sleep lost us, and for which\r\nhe has been broke. I think they will make Tripoli sensible, that they\r\nmistake their interest in choosing war with us; and Tunis also, should\r\nshe have declared war, as we expect, and almost wish.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this little diversion, we pay seven or eight millions of\r\ndollars annually of our public debt, and shall completely discharge\r\nit in twelve years more. That done, our annual revenue, now thirteen\r\nmillions of dollars, which by that time will be twenty-five, will pay\r\nthe expenses of any war we may be forced into, without new taxes or\r\nloans. The spirit of republicanism is now in almost all its ancient\r\nvigor, five sixths of the people being with us. Fourteen of the\r\nseventeen States are completely with us, and two of the other three will\r\nbe in one year. We have now got back to the ground on which you left us.\r\nI should have retired at the end of the first four years, but that the\r\nimmense load of tory calumnies which have been manufactured respecting\r\nme, and have filled the European market, have obliged me to appeal once\r\nmore to my country for a justification. I have no fear but that I shall\r\nreceive honorable testimony by their verdict on those calumnies. At the\r\nend of the next four years I shall certainly retire. Age, inclination,\r\nand principle all dictate this. My health, which at one time threatened\r\nan unfavorable turn, is now firm. The acquisition of Louisiana, besides\r\ndoubling our extent, and trebling our quantity of fertile country, is\r\nof incalculable value, as relieving us from the danger of war. It has\r\nenabled us to do a handsome thing for Fayette. He had received a grant\r\nof between eleven and twelve thousand acres north of the Ohio, worth,\r\nperhaps, a dollar an acre. We have obtained permission of Congress to\r\nlocate it in Louisiana. Locations can be found adjacent to the city of\r\nNew Orleans, in the island of New Orleans and in its vicinity, the value\r\nof which cannot be calculated. I hope it will induce him to come over\r\nand settle there with his family. Mr. Livingston having asked leave to\r\nreturn, General Armstrong, his brother-in-law, goes in his place: he is\r\nof the first order of talents.\r\n\r\nRemarkable deaths lately, are, Samuel Adams, Edmund Pendleton, Alexander\r\nHamilton, Stephens Thompson Mason, Mann Page, Bellini, and Parson\r\nAndrews. To these I have the inexpressible grief of adding the name of\r\nmy youngest daughter, who had married a son of Mr. Eppes, and has\r\nleft two children. My eldest daughter alone remains to me, and has six\r\nchildren. This loss has increased my anxiety to retire, while it has\r\ndreadfully lessened the comfort of doing it. Wythe, Dickinson, and\r\nCharles Thomson are all living, and are firm republicans. You informed\r\nme formerly of your marriage, and your having a daughter, but have said\r\nnothing in you late letters on that subject. Yet whatever concerns your\r\nhappiness is sincerely interesting to me, and is a subject of anxiety,\r\nretaining, as I do, cordial sentiments of esteem and affection for you.\r\nAccept, I pray you, my sincere assurances of this, with my most friendly\r\nsalutations.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XV.--TO MRS. ADAMS, July 22, 1804\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. ADAMS.\r\n\r\nWashington, July 22, 1804.\r\n\r\nDear Madam,\r\n\r\nYour favor of the 1st instant was duly received, and I would not again\r\nhave intruded on you, but to rectify certain facts which seem not to\r\nhave been presented to you under their true aspect. My charities to\r\nCallendar are considered as rewards for his calumnies. As early, I\r\nthink, as 1796, I was told in Philadelphia, that Callendar, the author\r\nof the ‘Political Progress of Britain,’ was in that city, a fugitive\r\nfrom persecution for having written that book, and in distress. I\r\nhad read and approved the book; I considered him as a man of genius,\r\nunjustly persecuted. I knew nothing of his private character, and\r\nimmediately expressed my readiness to contribute to his relief, and to\r\nserve him. It was a considerable time after, that, on application from\r\na person who thought of him as I did, I contributed to his relief, and\r\nafterwards repeated the contribution. Himself I did not see till long\r\nafter, nor ever more than two or three times. When he first began to\r\nwrite, he told some useful truths in his coarse way; but nobody sooner\r\ndisapproved of his writing than I did, or wished more that he would be\r\nsilent. My charities to him were no more meant as encouragements to his\r\nscurrilities, than those I give to the beggar at my door are meant\r\nas rewards for the vices of his life, and to make them chargeable to\r\nmyself. In truth, they would have been greater to him, had he never\r\nwritten a word after the work for which he fled from Britain. With\r\nrespect to the calumnies and falsehoods which writers and printers at\r\nlarge published against Mr. Adams, I was as far from stooping to any\r\nconcern or approbation of them, as Mr. Adams was respecting those of\r\nPorcupine, Fenno, or Russell, who published volumes against me for\r\nevery sentence vended by their opponents against Mr. Adams. But I never\r\nsupposed Mr. Adams had any participation in the atrocities of these\r\neditors, or their writers. I knew myself incapable of that base warfare,\r\nand believed him to be so. On the contrary, whatever I may have thought\r\nof the acts of the administration of that day, I have ever borne\r\ntestimony to Mr. Adams’s personal worth; nor was it ever impeached in my\r\npresence, without a just vindication of it on my part. I never supposed\r\nthat any person who knew either of us, could believe that either of us\r\nmeddled in that dirty work. But another fact is, that I ‘liberated a\r\nwretch who was suffering for a libel against Mr. Adams.’ I do not know\r\nwho was the particular wretch alluded to; but I discharged every person\r\nunder punishment or prosecution under the sedition law, because I\r\nconsidered, and now consider, that law to be a nullity, as absolute and\r\nas palpable as if Congress had ordered us to fall down and worship a\r\ngolden image; and that it was as much my duty to arrest its execution\r\nin every stage, as it would have been to have rescued from the fiery\r\nfurnace those who should have been cast into it for refusing to worship\r\nthe image. It was accordingly done in every instance, without asking\r\nwhat the offenders had done, or against whom they had offended, but\r\nwhether the pains they were suffering were inflicted under the pretended\r\nsedition law. It was certainly possible that my motives for contributing\r\nto the relief of Callendar, and liberating sufferers under the sedition\r\nlaw might have been to protect, encourage, and reward slander; but they\r\nmay also have been those which inspire ordinary charities to objects of\r\ndistress, meritorious or not, or the obligation of an oath to protect\r\nthe constitution, violated by an unauthorized act of Congress. Which of\r\nthese were my motives, must be decided by a regard to the general tenor\r\nof my life. On this I am not afraid to appeal to the nation at large,\r\nto posterity, and still less to that Being who sees himself our motives,\r\nwho will judge us from his own knowledge of them, and not on the\r\ntestimony of Porcupine or Fenno.\r\n\r\nYou observe, there has been one other act of my administration\r\npersonally unkind, and suppose it will readily suggest itself to me. I\r\ndeclare on my honor, Madam, I have not the least conception what act is\r\nalluded to. I never did a single one with an unkind intention. My sole\r\nobject in this letter being to place before your attention, that the\r\nacts imputed to me are either such as are falsely imputed, or as might\r\nflow from good as well as bad motives, I shall make no other addition,\r\nthan the assurances of my continued wishes for the health and happiness\r\nof yourself and Mr. Adams.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XVI.--TO JAMES MADISON, August 15, 1804\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nMonticello, August 15, 1804.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour letter dated the 7th should probably have been of the 14th, as I\r\nreceived it only by that day’s post. I return you Monroe’s letter, which\r\nis of an awful complexion; and I do not wonder the communications it\r\ncontains made some impression on him. To a person placed in Europe,\r\nsurrounded by the immense resources of the nations there, and the\r\ngreater wickedness of their courts, even the limits which nature imposes\r\non their enterprises are scarcely sensible. It is impossible that France\r\nand England should combine for any purpose; their mutual distrust and\r\ndeadly hatred of each other admit no co-operation. It is impossible that\r\nEngland should be willing to see France re-possess Louisiana, or get\r\nfooting on our continent, and that France should willingly see the\r\nUnited States re-annexed to the British dominions. That the Bourbons\r\nshould be replaced on their throne and agree to any terms of\r\nrestitution, is possible: but that they and England joined, could\r\nrecover us to British dominion, is impossible. If these things are\r\nnot so, then human reason is of no aid in conjecturing the conduct of\r\nnations. Still, however, it is our unquestionable interest and duty to\r\nconduct ourselves with such sincere friendship and impartiality towards\r\nboth nations, as that each may see unequivocally, what is unquestionably\r\ntrue, that we may be very possibly driven into her scale by unjust\r\nconduct in the other. I am so much impressed with the expediency of\r\nputting a termination to the right of France to patronize the rights of\r\nLouisiana, which will cease with their complete adoption as citizens of\r\nthe United States, that I hope to see that take place on the meeting\r\nof Congress. I enclose you a paragraph from a newspaper respecting St.\r\nDomingo, which gives me uneasiness. Still I conceive the British insults\r\nin our harbor as more threatening. We cannot be respected by France as a\r\nneutral nation, nor by the world or ourselves as an independent one,\r\nif we do not take effectual measures to support, at every risk, our\r\nauthority in our own harbors. I shall write to Mr. Wagner directly\r\n(that a post may not be lost by passing through you) to send us blank\r\ncommissions for Orleans and Louisiana, ready sealed, to be filled up,\r\nsigned, and forwarded by us. Affectionate salutations and constant\r\nesteem.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XVII.--TO GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE, August 30, 1804\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE.\r\n\r\nMonticello, August 30, 1804.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nVarious circumstances of delay have prevented my forwarding till now\r\nthe general arrangements of the government of the territory of Orleans.\r\nEnclosed herewith you will receive the commissions. Among these is one\r\nfor yourself as Governor. With respect to this I will enter into frank\r\nexplanations. This office was originally destined for a person * whose\r\ngreat services and established fame would have rendered him peculiarly\r\nacceptable to the nation at large. Circumstances, however, exist,\r\nwhich do not now permit his nomination, and perhaps may not at any time\r\nhereafter. That, therefore, being suspended, and entirely contingent,\r\nyour services have been so much approved, as to leave no desire to\r\nlook elsewhere to fill the office. Should the doubts you have sometimes\r\nexpressed, whether it would be eligible for you to continue, still exist\r\nin your mind, the acceptance of the commission gives you time to satisfy\r\nyourself by further experience, and to make the time and manner of\r\nwithdrawing, should you ultimately determine on that, agreeable to\r\nyourself. Be assured, that whether you continue or retire, it will be\r\nwith every disposition on my part to be just and friendly to you.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nI salute you with friendship and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n     [* In the margin is written by the author, ‘La Fayette.’]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XVIII.--TO MRS. ADAMS, September 11, 1804\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. ADAMS.\r\n\r\nMonticello, September 11, 1804,\r\n\r\nYour letter, Madam, of the 18th of August has been some days received,\r\nbut a press of business has prevented the acknowledgment of it: perhaps,\r\nindeed, I may have already trespassed too far on your attention. With\r\nthose who wish to think amiss of me, I have learned to be perfectly\r\nindifferent; but where I know a mind to be ingenuous, and to need only\r\ntruth to set it to rights, I cannot be as passive. The act of personal\r\nunkindness alluded to in your former letter, is said in your last to\r\nhave been the removal of your eldest son from some office to which\r\nthe judges had appointed him. I conclude, then, he must have been a\r\ncommissioner of bankruptcy. But I declare to you, on my honor, that\r\nthis is the first knowledge I have ever had that he was so. It may be\r\nthought, perhaps, that I ought to have inquired who were such, before\r\nI appointed others. But it is to be observed, that the former law\r\npermitted the judges to name commissioners occasionally only, for every\r\ncase as it arose, and not to make them permanent officers. Nobody,\r\ntherefore, being in office, there could be no removal. The judges, you\r\nwell know, have been considered as highly federal; and it was noted\r\nthat they confined their nominations exclusively to federalists. The\r\nlegislature, dissatisfied with this, transferred the nomination to the\r\nPresident, and made the offices permanent. The very object in passing\r\nthe law was, that he should correct, not confirm, what was deemed the\r\npartiality of the judges. I thought it therefore proper to inquire,\r\nnot whom they had employed, but whom I ought to appoint to fulfil\r\nthe intentions of the law. In making these appointments, I put in a\r\nproportion of federalists, equal, I believe, to the proportion they bear\r\nin numbers through the Union generally. Had I known that your son had\r\nacted, it would have been a real pleasure to me to have preferred him\r\nto some who were named in Boston, in what was deemed the same line\r\nof politics. To this I should have been led by my knowledge of his\r\nintegrity, as well as my sincere dispositions towards yourself and Mr.\r\nAdams.\r\n\r\nYou seem to think it devolved on the judges to decide on the validity of\r\nthe sedition law. But nothing in the constitution has given them a right\r\nto decide for the executive, more than to the executive to decide for\r\nthem. Both magistracies are equally independent in the sphere of action\r\nassigned to them. The judges, believing the law constitutional, had a\r\nright to pass a sentence of fine and imprisonment, because the power was\r\nplaced in their hands by the constitution. But the executive, believing\r\nthe law to be unconstitutional, were bound to remit the execution of it;\r\nbecause that power has been confided to them by the constitution. That\r\ninstrument meant that its co-ordinate branches should be checks on each\r\nother. But the opinion which gives to the judges the right to decide\r\nwhat laws are constitutional, and what not, not only for themselves in\r\ntheir own sphere of action, but for the legislature and executive also\r\nin their spheres, would make the judiciary a despotic branch. Nor does\r\nthe opinion of the unconstitutionality, and consequent nullity of that\r\nlaw, remove all restraint from the overwhelming torrent of slander,\r\nwhich is confounding all vice and virtue, all truth and falsehood,\r\nin the United States. The power to do that is fully possessed by the\r\nseveral State legislatures. It was reserved to them, and was denied\r\nto the General Government, by the constitution, according to our\r\nconstruction of it. While we deny that Congress have a right to control\r\nthe freedom of the press, we have ever asserted the right of the States,\r\nand their exclusive right, to do so. They have, accordingly, all of them\r\nmade provisions for punishing slander, which those who have time and\r\ninclination resort to for the vindication of their characters. In\r\ngeneral, the State laws appear to have made the presses responsible for\r\nslander as far as is consistent with its useful freedom. In those States\r\nwhere they do not admit even the truth of allegations to protect the\r\nprinter, they have gone too far.\r\n\r\nThe candor manifested in your letter, and which I ever believed you to\r\npossess, has alone inspired the desire of calling your attention once\r\nmore to those circumstances of fact and motive by which I claim to be\r\njudged. I hope you will see these intrusions on your time to be, what\r\nthey really are, proofs of my great, respect for you. I tolerate with\r\nthe utmost latitude the right of others to differ from me in opinion,\r\nwithout imputing to them criminality. I know too well the weakness and\r\nuncertainty of human reason, to wonder at its different results. Both\r\nof our political parties, at least the honest part of them, agree\r\nconscientiously in the same object, the public good: but they differ\r\nessentially in what they deem the means of promoting that good. One side\r\nbelieves it best done by one composition of the governing powers; the\r\nother, by a different one. One fears most the ignorance of the people;\r\nthe other, the selfishness of rulers independent of them. Which is\r\nright, time and experience will prove. We think that one side of this\r\nexperiment has been long enough tried, and proved not to promote\r\nthe good of the many: and that the other has not been fairly and\r\nsufficiently tried. Our opponents think the reverse. With whichever\r\nopinion the body of the nation concurs, that must prevail. My anxieties\r\non this subject will never carry me beyond the use of fair and honorable\r\nmeans of truth and reason; nor have they ever lessened my esteem for\r\nmoral worth, nor alienated my affections from a single friend, who did\r\nnot first withdraw himself. Wherever this has happened, I confess I have\r\nnot been insensible to it: yet have ever kept myself open to a return\r\nof their justice. I conclude with sincere prayers for your health and\r\nhappiness, that yourself and Mr. Adams may long enjoy the tranquillity\r\nyou desire and merit, and see in the prosperity of your family what is\r\nthe consummation of the last and warmest of human wishes,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XIX.--TO MR. NICHOLSON, January 29, 1805\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. NICHOLSON.\r\n\r\nWashington, January 29, 1805.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMr. Eppes has this moment put into my hands your letter of yesterday,\r\nasking information on the subject of the gun-boats proposed to be built.\r\nI lose no time in communicating to you fully my whole views respecting\r\nthem, premising a few words on the system of fortifications. Considering\r\nthe harbors which, from their situation and importance, are entitled to\r\ndefence, and the estimates we have seen of the fortifications planned\r\nfor some of them, this system cannot be completed on a moderate scale\r\nfor less than fifty millions of dollars, nor manned in time of war with\r\nless than fifty thousand men, and in peace, two thousand. And when\r\ndone, they avail little; because all military men agree, that wherever a\r\nvessel may pass a fort without tacking under her guns, which is the case\r\nat all our sea-port towns, she may be annoyed more or less, according\r\nto the advantages of the position, but can never be prevented. Our\r\nown experience during the war proved this on different occasions. Our\r\npredecessors have, nevertheless, proposed to go into this system, and\r\nhad commenced it. But, no law requiring us to proceed, we have suspended\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIf we cannot hinder vessels from entering our harbors, we should turn\r\nour attention to the putting it out of their power to lie, or come to,\r\nbefore a town, to injure it. Two means of doing this may be adopted in\r\naid of each other. 1. Heavy cannon on travelling carriages, which may be\r\nmoved to any point on the bank or beach most convenient for dislodging\r\nthe vessel. A sufficient number of these should be lent to each sea-port\r\ntown, and their militia trained to them. The executive is authorized to\r\ndo this; it has been done in a smaller degree, and will now be done more\r\ncompetently.\r\n\r\n2. Having cannon on floating batteries or boats, which may be so\r\nstationed as to prevent a vessel entering the harbor, or force her\r\nafter entering to depart. There are about fifteen harbors in the United\r\nStates, which ought to be in a state of substantial defence. The whole\r\nof these would require, according to the best opinions, two hundred\r\nand forty gun-boats. Their cost was estimated by Captain Rogers at two\r\nthousand dollars each; but we had better say four thousand dollars. The\r\nwhole would cost one million of dollars. But we should allow ourselves\r\nten years to complete it, unless circumstances should force it sooner.\r\nThere are three situations in which the gun-boat may be. 1. Hauled up\r\nunder a shed, in readiness to be launched and manned by the seamen and\r\nmilitia of the town on short notice. In this situation she costs nothing\r\nbut an enclosure, or a centinel to see that no mischief is done to her.\r\n2. Afloat, and with men enough to navigate her in harbor and take care\r\nof her, but depending on receiving her crew from the town on short\r\nwarning. In this situation, her annual expense is about two thousand\r\ndollars, as by an official estimate at the end of this letter. 3. Fully\r\nmanned for action. Her annual expense in this situation is about eight\r\nthousand dollars, as per estimate subjoined. ‘When there is general\r\npeace, we should probably keep about six or seven afloat in the second\r\nsituation; their annual expense twelve to fourteen thousand dollars; the\r\nrest all hauled up. When France and England are at war, we should keep,\r\nat the utmost, twenty-five in the second situation, their annual expense\r\nfifty thousand dollars. When we should be at war ourselves, some of them\r\nwould probably be kept in the third situation, at an annual expense of\r\neight thousand dollars; but how many, must depend on the circumstances\r\nof the war. We now possess ten, built and building. It is the opinion of\r\nthose consulted, that fifteen more would enable us to put every harbor\r\nunder our view into a respectable condition; and that this should limit\r\nthe views of the present year. This would require an appropriation of\r\nsixty thousand dollars, and I suppose that the best way of limiting it,\r\nwithout declaring the number, as perhaps that sum would build more. I\r\nshould think it best not to give a detailed report, which exposes our\r\npolicy too much. A bill, with verbal explanations, will suffice for the\r\ninformation of the House. I do not know whether General Wilkinson would\r\napprove the printing his paper. If he would, it would be useful. Accept\r\naffectionate and respectful salutations.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XX.--TO MR. VOLNEY, February 8, 1805\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. VOLNEY.\r\n\r\nWashington, February 8, 1805.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour letter of November the 26th came to hand May the 14th; the books\r\nsome time after, which were all distributed according to direction.\r\nThe copy for the East Indies went immediately by a safe conveyance. The\r\nletter of April the 28th, and the copy of your work accompanying\r\nthat, did not come to hand till August. That copy was deposited in the\r\nCongressional library. It was not till my return here from my autumnal\r\nvisit to Monticello, that I had an opportunity of reading your work. I\r\nhave read it, and with great satisfaction. Of the first part I am less a\r\njudge than most people, having never travelled westward of Staunton,\r\nso as to know any thing of the face of the country; nor much indulged\r\nmyself in geological inquiries, from a belief that the skin-deep\r\nscratches, which we can make or find on the surface of the earth, do not\r\nrepay our time with as certain and useful deductions, as our pursuits in\r\nsome other branches. The subject of our winds is more familiar to me.\r\nOn that, the views you have taken are always great, supported in their\r\noutlines by your facts; and though more extensive observations, and\r\nlonger continued, may produce some anomalies, yet they will probably\r\ntake their place in this first great canvass which you have sketched. In\r\nno case, perhaps, does habit attach our choice or judgment more than\r\nin climate. The Canadian glows with delight in his sleigh and snow,\r\nthe very idea of which gives me the shivers. The comparison of climate\r\nbetween Europe and North America, taking together its corresponding\r\nparts, hangs chiefly on three great points. 1. The changes between heat\r\nand cold in America are greater and more frequent, and the extremes\r\ncomprehend a greater scale on the thermometer in America than in Europe.\r\nHabit, however, prevents these from affecting us more than the smaller\r\nchanges of Europe affect the European. But he is greatly affected by\r\nours. 2. Our sky is always clear; that of Europe always cloudy. Hence a\r\ngreater accumulation of heat here than there, in the same parallel. 3.\r\nThe changes between wet and dry are much more frequent and sudden in\r\nEurope than in America. Though we have double the rain, it falls in half\r\nthe time. Taking all these together, I prefer much the climate of the\r\nUnited States to that of Europe. I think it a more cheerful one. It\r\nis our cloudless sky which has eradicated from our constitutions all\r\ndisposition to hang ourselves, which we might otherwise have inherited\r\nfrom our English ancestors. During a residence of between six and seven\r\nyears in Paris, I never but once saw the sun shine through a whole day,\r\nwithout being obscured by a cloud in any part of it: and I never saw the\r\nmoment, in which, viewing the sky through its whole hemisphere, I could\r\nsay there was not the smallest speck of a cloud in it. I arrived at\r\nMonticello, on my return from France, in January, and during only two\r\nmonths’ stay there, I observed to my daughters, who had been with me to\r\nFrance, that twenty odd times within that term, there was not a speck of\r\na cloud in the whole hemisphere. Still I do not wonder that an European\r\nshould prefer his grey to our azure sky. Habit decides our taste in\r\nthis, as in most other cases.\r\n\r\nThe account you give of the yellow fever, is entirely agreeable to what\r\nwe then knew of it. Further experience has developed more and more\r\nits peculiar character. Facts appear to have established, that it is\r\noriginated here by a local atmosphere, which is never generated but\r\nin the lower, closer, and dirtier parts of our large cities, in the\r\nneighborhood of the water; and that, to catch the disease, you must\r\nenter the local atmosphere. Persons having taken the disease in the\r\ninfected quarter, and going into the country, are nursed and buried by\r\ntheir friends, without an example of communicating it. A vessel going\r\nfrom the infected quarter, and carrying its atmosphere in its hold into\r\nanother State, has given the disease to every person who there entered\r\nher. These have died in the arms of their families, without a single\r\ncommunication of the disease. It is certainly, therefore, an epidemic,\r\nnot a contagious disease; and calls on the chemists for some mode\r\nof purifying the vessel by a decomposition of its atmosphere, if\r\nventilation be found insufficient. In the long scale of bilious fevers,\r\ngraduated by many shades, this is probably the last and most mortal\r\nterm. It seizes the native of the place equally with strangers. It has\r\nnot been long known in any part of the United States. The shade\r\nnext above it, called the stranger’s fever, has been coeval with the\r\nsettlement of the larger cities in the southern parts, to wit, Norfolk,\r\nCharleston, New Orleans. Strangers going to these places in the months\r\nof July, August, or September, find this fever as mortal as the genuine\r\nyellow fever. But it rarely attacks those who have resided in them\r\nsome time. Since we have known that kind of yellow fever which is no\r\nrespecter of persons, its name has been extended to the stranger’s\r\nfever, and every species of bilious fever which produces a black vomit,\r\nthat is to say, a discharge of very dark bile. Hence we hear of yellow\r\nfever on the Allegany mountains, in Kentucky, &c. This is a matter\r\nof definition only: but it leads into error those who do not know how\r\nloosely and how interestedly some physicians think and speak. So far\r\nas we have yet seen, I think we are correct in saying, that the yellow\r\nfever, which seizes on all indiscriminately, is an ultimate degree of\r\nbilious fever, never known in the United States till lately, nor farther\r\nsouth, as yet, than Alexandria, and that what they have recently called\r\nthe yellow fever in New Orleans, Charleston, and Norfolk, is what has\r\nalways been known in those places as confined chiefly to strangers, and\r\nnearly as mortal to them, as the other is to all its subjects. But both\r\ngrades are local: the stranger’s fever less so, as it sometimes extends\r\na little into the neighborhood; but the yellow fever rigorously so,\r\nconfined within narrow and well defined limits, and not communicable\r\nout of those limits. Such a constitution of atmosphere being requisite\r\nto originate this disease as is generated only in low, close, and\r\nill-cleansed parts of a town, I have supposed it practicable to prevent\r\nits generation by building our cities on a more open plan. Take, for\r\ninstance, the chequer-board for a plan. Let the black squares only be\r\nbuilding squares, and the white ones be left open, in turf and trees.\r\nEvery square of houses will be surrounded by four open squares, and\r\nevery house will front an open square. The atmosphere of such a town\r\nwould be like that of the country, insusceptible of the miasmata which\r\nproduce yellow fever. I have accordingly proposed that the enlargements\r\nof the city of New Orleans, which must immediately take place, shall be\r\non this plan. But it is only in case of enlargements to be made, or of\r\ncities to be built, that his means of prevention can be employed.\r\n\r\nThe _genus irritabile vatum_ could not let the author of the Ruins\r\npublish a new work, without seeking in it the means of discrediting that\r\npuzzling composition. Some one of those holy calumniators has selected\r\nfrom your new work every scrap of a sentence, which, detached from its\r\ncontext, could displease an American reader. A cento has been made of\r\nthese, which has run through a particular description of newspapers, and\r\nexcited a disapprobation even in friendly minds, which nothing but the\r\nreading of the book will cure. But time and truth will at length correct\r\nerror.\r\n\r\nOur countrymen are so much occupied in the busy scenes of life, that\r\nthey have little time to write or invent. A good invention here,\r\ntherefore, is such a rarity as it is lawful to offer to the acceptance\r\nof a friend. A Mr. Hawkins of Frankford, near Philadelphia, has invented\r\na machine, which he calls a polygraph, and which carries two, three, or\r\nfour pens. That of two pens, with which I am now writing, is best;\r\nand is so perfect that I have laid aside the copying-press, for a\r\ntwelvemonth past, and write always with the polygraph. I have directed\r\none to be made, of which I ask your acceptance. By what conveyance I\r\nshall send it while Havre is blockaded, I do not yet know. I think you\r\nwill be pleased with it, and will use it habitually as I do; because it\r\nrequires only that degree of mechanical attention which I know you to\r\npossess. I am glad to hear that M. Cabanis is engaged in writing on the\r\nreformation of medicine. It needs the hand of a reformer, and cannot\r\nbe in better hands than his. Will you permit my respects to him and the\r\nAbbe de la Roche to find a place here.\r\n\r\nA word now on our political state. The two parties which prevailed with\r\nso much violence when you were here, are almost wholly melted into\r\none. At the late Presidential election I have received one hundred and\r\nsixty-two votes against fourteen only. Connecticut is still federal by a\r\nsmall majority; and Delaware on a poise, as she has been since 1775, and\r\nwill be till Anglomany with her yields to Americanism. Connecticut will\r\nbe with us in a short time. Though the people in mass have joined us,\r\ntheir leaders had committed themselves too far to retract. Pride keeps\r\nthem hostile; they brood over their angry passions, and give them vent\r\nin the newspapers which they maintain. They still make as much noise as\r\nif they were the whole nation. Unfortunately, these being the mercantile\r\npapers, published chiefly in the seaports, are the only ones which find\r\ntheir way to Europe, and make very false impressions there. I am happy\r\nto hear that the late derangement of your health is going off, and that\r\nyou are reestablished. I sincerely pray for the continuance of that\r\nblessing, and with my affectionate salutations, tender you assurances of\r\ngreat respect and attachment.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\nP. S. The sheets which you receive are those of the copying-pen of the\r\npolygraph, not of the one with which I have written.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXI.--TO JUDGE TYLER, March 29, 1805\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JUDGE TYLER.\r\n\r\nMonticello, March 29, 1805.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of the 17th found me on a short visit to this place, and I\r\nobserve in it with great pleasure a continuance of your approbation\r\nof the course we are pursuing, and particularly the satisfaction you\r\nexpress with the last inaugural address. The first was, from the nature\r\nof the case, all profession and promise. Performance, therefore, seemed\r\nto be the proper office of the second. But the occasion restricted me to\r\nmention only the most prominent heads, and the strongest justification\r\nof these in the fewest words possible. The crusade preached against\r\nphilosophy by the modern disciples of steady habits, induced me to dwell\r\nmore in showing its effect with the Indians than the subject otherwise\r\njustified.\r\n\r\nThe war with Tripoli stands on two grounds of fact. 1st. It is made\r\nknown to us by our agents with the three other Barbary States, that they\r\nonly wait to see the event of this, to shape their conduct accordingly.\r\nIf the war is ended by additional tribute, they mean to offer us the\r\nsame alternative. 2ndly. If peace was made, we should still, and shall\r\never, be obliged to keep a frigate in the Mediterranean to overawe\r\nrupture, or we must abandon that market. Our intention in sending Morris\r\nwith a respectable force, was to try whether peace could be forced by\r\na coercive enterprise on their town. His inexecution of orders baffled\r\nthat effort. Having broke him, we try the same experiment under a better\r\ncommander. If in the course of the summer they cannot produce peace, we\r\nshall recall our force, except one frigate and two small vessels, which\r\nwill keep up a perpetual blockade. Such a blockade will cost us no more\r\nthan a state of peace, and will save us from increased tributes, and\r\nthe disgrace attached to them. There is reason to believe the example\r\nwe have set, begins already to work on the dispositions of the powers\r\nof Europe to emancipate themselves from that degrading yoke. Should we\r\nproduce such a revolution there, we shall be amply rewarded for what\r\nwe have done. Accept my friendly salutations, and assurances of great\r\nrespect and esteem.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXII.--TO DOCTOR LOGAN, May 11, 1805\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR LOGAN.\r\n\r\nWashington, May 11, 1805.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI see with infinite pain the bloody schism which has taken place among\r\nour friends in Pennsylvania and New York, and will probably take place\r\nin other States. The main body of both sections mean well, but their\r\ngood intentions will produce great public evil. The minority,\r\nwhichever section shall be the minority, will end in coalition with the\r\nfederalists, and some compromise of principle; because these will not\r\nsell their aid for nothing. Republicanism will thus lose, and royalism\r\ngain, some portion of that ground which we thought we had rescued to\r\ngood government. I do not express my sense of our misfortunes from any\r\nidea that they are remediable. I know that the passions of men will take\r\ntheir course, that they are not to be controlled but by despotism, and\r\nthat this melancholy truth is the pretext for despotism. The duty of an\r\nupright administration is to pursue its course steadily, to know nothing\r\nof these family dissensions, and to cherish the good principles of\r\nboth parties. The war _ad internecionem_ which we have waged against\r\nfederalism, has filled our latter times with strife and unhappiness. We\r\nhave met it, with pain indeed, but with firmness, because we believed it\r\nthe last convulsive effort of that Hydra, which in earlier times we had\r\nconquered in the field. But if any degeneracy of principle should ever\r\nrender it necessary to give ascendancy to one of the rising sections\r\nover the other, I thank my God it will fall to some other to perform\r\nthat operation. The only cordial I wish to carry into my retirement, is\r\nthe undivided good will of all those with whom I have acted.\r\n\r\nPresent me affectionately to Mrs. Logan, and accept my salutations, and\r\nassurances of constant friendship and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXIII.--TO JUDGE SULLIVAN, May 21, 1805\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JUDGE SULLIVAN.\r\n\r\nWashington, May 21, 1805.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nAn accumulation of business, which I found on my return here from a\r\nshort visit to Monticello, has prevented till now my acknowledgment of\r\nyour favor of the 14th _ultimo_. This delay has given time to see the\r\nresult of the contest in your State, and I cannot but congratulate you\r\non the advance it manifests, and the certain prospect it offers that\r\nanother year restores Massachusetts to the general body of the nation.\r\nYou have indeed received the federal unction of lying and slandering.\r\nBut who has not? Who will ever again come into eminent office,\r\nunanointed with this chrism? It seems to be fixed that falsehood and\r\ncalumny are to be their ordinary engines of opposition; engines which\r\nwill not be entirely without effect. The circle of characters equal\r\nto the first stations is not too large, and will be lessened by the\r\nvoluntary retreat of those whose sensibilities are stronger than their\r\nconfidence in the justice of public opinion. I certainly have known, and\r\nstill know, characters eminently qualified for the most exalted trusts,\r\nwho could not bear up against the brutal hackings and hewings of these\r\nheroes of Billingsgate. I may say, from intimate knowledge, that we\r\nshould have lost the services of the greatest character of our country,\r\nhad he been assailed with the degree of abandoned licentiousness now\r\npractised. The torture he felt under rare and slight attacks, proved\r\nthat under those of which the federal bands have shown themselves\r\ncapable, he would have thrown up the helm in a burst of indignation.\r\nYet this effect of sensibility must not be yielded to. If we suffer\r\nourselves to be frightened from our post by mere lying, surely the enemy\r\nwill use that weapon; for what one so cheap to those of whose system of\r\npolitics morality makes no part? The patriot, like the Christian, must\r\nlearn that to bear revilings and persecutions is a part of his duty;\r\nand in proportion as the trial is severe, firmness under it becomes more\r\nrequisite and praiseworthy. It requires, indeed, self-command. But\r\nthat will be fortified in proportion as the calls for its exercise are\r\nrepeated. In this I am persuaded we shall have the benefit of your good\r\nexample. To the other falsehoods they have brought forward, should they\r\nadd, as you expect, insinuations of want of confidence in you from the\r\nadministration generally, or myself particularly, it will, like their\r\nother falsehoods, produce in the public mind a contrary inference.\r\n\r\n*********\r\n\r\nI tender you my friendly and respectful salutations.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXIV.--TO THOMAS PAINE, June 5, 1805\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS PAINE.\r\n\r\nWashington, June 5, 1805.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour letters, Nos. 1, 2, 3, the last of them dated April the 20th, were\r\nreceived April the 26th. I congratulate you on your retirement to\r\nyour farm, and still more that it is of a character so worthy of your\r\nattention. I much doubt whether the open room on your second story will\r\nanswer your expectations. There will be a few days in the year in which\r\nit will be delightful, but not many. Nothing but trees, or Venetian\r\nblinds, can protect it from the sun. The semi-cylindrical roof you\r\npropose will have advantages. You know it has been practised on the\r\ncloth market at Paris. De Lorme, the inventor, shows many forms of roofs\r\nin his book, to which it is applicable. I have used it at home for a\r\ndome, being one hundred and twenty degrees of an oblong octagon, and in\r\nthe capitol we unite two quadrants of a sphere by a semi-cylinder: all\r\nframed in De Lorme’s manner. How has your planing machine answered? Has\r\nit been tried and persevered in by any workman?\r\n\r\nFrance has become so jealous of our conduct as to St. Domingo (which in\r\ntruth is only the conduct of our merchants), that the offer to become\r\na mediator would only confirm her suspicions. Bonaparte, however,\r\nexpressed satisfaction at the paragraph in my message to Congress on the\r\nsubject of that commerce. With respect to the German redemptioners,\r\nyou know I can do nothing, unless authorized by law. It would be made a\r\nquestion in Congress, whether any of the enumerated objects to which\r\nthe constitution authorizes the money of the Union to be applied, would\r\ncover an expenditure for importing settlers to Orleans. The letter of\r\nthe revolutionary sergeant was attended to by General Dearborn, who\r\nwrote to him informing him how to proceed to obtain his land.\r\n\r\nDoctor Eustis’s observation to you, that ‘certain paragraphs in the\r\nNational Intelligencer,’ respecting my letter to you, ‘supposed to be\r\nunder Mr. Jefferson’s direction, had embarrassed Mr. Jefferson’s friends\r\nin Massachusetts; that they appeared like a half denial of the letter,\r\nor as if there was something in it not proper to be owned, or that\r\nneeded an apology,’ is one of those mysterious half confidences\r\ndifficult to be understood. That tory printers should think it\r\nadvantageous to identify me with that paper, the Aurora, &c. in order to\r\nobtain ground for abusing me, is perhaps fair warfare. But that any one\r\nwho knows me personally should listen one moment to such an insinuation,\r\nis what I did not expect. I neither have, nor ever had, any more\r\nconnection with those papers than our antipodes have; nor know what is\r\nto be in them until I see it in them, except proclamations and other\r\ndocuments sent for publication. The friends in Massachusetts who could\r\nbe embarrassed by so weak a weapon as this, must be feeble friends\r\nindeed. With respect to the letter, I never hesitated to avow and to\r\njustify it in conversation. In no other way do I trouble myself to\r\ncontradict any thing which is said. At that time, however, there were\r\ncertain anomalies in the motions of some of our friends, which events\r\nhave at length reduced to regularity.\r\n\r\nIt seems very difficult to find out what turn things are to take in\r\nEurope. I suppose it depends on Austria, which knowing it is to stand in\r\nthe way of receiving the first hard blows, is cautious of entering into\r\na coalition. As to France and England we can have but one wish, that\r\nthey may disable one another from injuring others.\r\n\r\nAccept my friendly salutations, and assurances of esteem and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following, in the hand-writing of the Author, is inserted in his\r\nMS. of this period. Whether it was published, or where, is not stated.]\r\n\r\nRichmond, 1780, December 31. At 8 A. M. the Governor receives the first\r\nintelligence that twenty-seven sail of ships had entered Chesapeake Bay,\r\nand were in the morning of the 29th just below Willoughby’s point (the\r\nsouthern cape of James river); their destination unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n1781, January 2. At 10 A. M. information received that they had entered\r\nJames river, their advance being at Warrasqueak bay. Orders were\r\nimmediately given for calling in the militia, one fourth from some,\r\nand one half from other counties. The members of the legislature,\r\nwhich rises this day, are the bearers of the orders to their respective\r\ncounties. The Governor directs the removal of the records into the\r\ncountry, and the transportation of the military stores from Richmond to\r\nWestham (on the river seven miles above); there to be carried across the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary 3. At 8 P. M. the enemy are said to be a little below Jamestown;\r\nconvenient for landing, if Williamsburg is their object.\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary 4. At 5 A. M. information is received that they had passed\r\nKennon’s and Hood’s the evening before, with a strong; easterly wind,\r\nwhich determines their object to be either Petersburg or Richmond. The\r\nGovernor now calls in the whole militia from the adjacent counties.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt 5 P. M. information, that at 2 P. M. they were landed and drawn up\r\nat Westover (on the north side of the river, and twenty-five miles below\r\nRichmond); and consequently Richmond their destination. Orders are\r\nnow given to discontinue wagoning the military stores from Richmond to\r\nWestham, and to throw them across the river directly at Richmond.\r\n\r\nThe Governor having attended to this till an hour and a half in the\r\nnight, then rode up to the foundery (one mile below Westham), ordered\r\nCaptains Boush and Irish, and Mr. Hylton, to continue all night wagoning\r\nto Westham the arms and stores still at the foundery, to be thrown\r\nacross the river at Westham, then proceeded to Westham to urge the\r\npressing the transportation there across the river, and thence went to\r\nTuckahoe (eight miles above and on the same side of the river) to see\r\nafter his family, which he had sent that far in the course of the day.\r\nHe arrived there at 1 o’clock in the night.\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary 5. Early in the morning, he carried his family across the river\r\nthere, and sending them to Fine Creek (eight miles higher up) went\r\nhimself to Britton’s on the south side of the river, (opposite to\r\nWestham). Finding the arms, &c. in a heap near the shore, and exposed\r\nto be destroyed by cannon from the north bank, he had them removed under\r\ncover of a point of land near by. He proceeded to Manchester (opposite\r\nto Richmond). The enemy had arrived at Richmond at 1 P. M. Having found\r\nthat nearly the whole arms had been got there from Richmond, he set out\r\nfor Chetwood’s to meet with Baron Steuben, who had appointed that\r\nplace as a rendezvous and head-quarters; but not finding him there,\r\nand understanding he would be at Colonel Fleming’s (six miles above\r\nBritton’s), he proceeded thither. The enemy had now a detachment\r\nat Westham, and sent a deputation from the city of Richmond to the\r\nGovernor, at Colonel Fleming’s, to propose terms for ransoming the\r\nsafety of the city, which terms he rejected.\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary 6. The Governor returned to Britton’s, had measures taken more\r\neffectually to secure the books and papers there. The enemy, having\r\nburnt some houses and stores, left Richmond after twenty-four hours’\r\nstay there, and encamped at Four Mile Creek (eight or ten miles below);\r\nand the Governor went to look to his family at Fine Creek.\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary 7. He returned to Britton’s to see further to the arms there,\r\nexposed on the ground to heavy rains which had fallen the night before,\r\nand thence proceeded to Manchester and lodged there. The enemy encamped\r\nat Westover.\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary 8. At half after 7 A. M. he crossed over to Richmond, and\r\nresumed his residence there. The enemy are still retained in their\r\nencampment at Westover by an easterly wind. Colonel John Nicholas has\r\nnow three hundred militia at the Forest (six miles off from Westover);\r\nGeneral Nelson, two hundred at Charles City Court-House (eight miles\r\nbelow Westover); Gibson, one thousand, and Baron Steuben, eight hundred,\r\non the south side of the river.\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary 9. The enemy are still encamped at Westover.\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary 10. At 1 P. M. they embark: and the wind having shifted a little\r\nto the north of west, and pretty fresh, they fall down the river. Baron\r\nSteuben marches for Hood’s, where their passage may be checked. He\r\nreaches Bland’s mills in the evening, within nine miles of Hood’s.\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary 11. At 8 A. M. the wind due west and strong, they make good\r\ntheir retreat.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring this period, time and place have been minutely cited, in order\r\nthat those who think there was any remissness in the movements of the\r\nGovernor, may lay their finger on the point, and say, when and where it\r\nwas. Hereafter, less detail will suffice.\r\n\r\nSoon after this, General Phillips having joined Arnold with a\r\nreinforcement of two thousand men, they advanced again up to Petersburg,\r\nand about the last of April to Manchester. The Governor had remained\r\nconstantly in and about Richmond, exerting all his powers for collecting\r\nmilitia, and providing such means for the defence of the State as its\r\nexhausted resources admitted. Never assuming a guard, and with only the\r\nriver between him and the enemy, his lodgings were frequently within\r\nfour, five, or six miles of them.\r\n\r\nM. de la Fayette about this time arrived at Richmond with some\r\ncontinental troops, with which, and the militia collected, he continued\r\nto occupy that place, and the north bank of the river, while Phillips\r\nand Arnold held Manchester and the south bank. But Lord Cornwallis,\r\nabout the middle of May, joining them with the main southern army, M.\r\nde la Fayette was obliged to retire. The enemy crossed the river, and\r\nadvanced up into the country about fifty miles, and within thirty miles\r\nof Charlottesville, at which place the legislature being to meet in\r\nJune, the Governor proceeded to his seat at Monticello, two or three\r\nmiles from it. His office was now near expiring, the country under\r\ninvasion by a powerful army, no services but military of any avail;\r\nunprepared by his line of life and education for the command of armies,\r\nhe believed it right not to stand in the way of talents better fitted\r\nthan his own to the circumstances under which the country was placed.\r\nHe therefore himself proposed to his friends in the legislature, that\r\nGeneral Nelson, who commanded the militia of the State, should be\r\nappointed Governor, as he was sensible that the union of the civil and\r\nmilitary power in the same hands, at this time, would greatly facilitate\r\nmilitary measures. This appointment accordingly took place on the 12th\r\nof June, 1781.\r\n\r\nThis was the state of things, when, his office having actually expired,\r\nand no successor yet in place, Colonel Tarleton, with his regiment, of\r\nhorse, was detached by Lord Cornwallis to surprise Mr. Jefferson\r\n(whom they thought still in office) and the legislature now sitting in\r\nCharlottesville. The Speakers of the two Houses, and some other members\r\nof the legislature, were lodging with Mr. Jefferson at Monticello.\r\nTarleton, early in the morning, (June 23, I believe,) when within ten\r\nmiles of that place, detached a company of horse to secure him and\r\nhis guests, and proceeded himself rapidly with his main body to\r\nCharlottesville, where he hoped to find the legislature unapprized of\r\nhis movement. Notice of it, however, had been brought both to Monticello\r\nand Charlottesville about sunrise. The Speakers, with their colleagues,\r\nreturned to Charlottesville, and, with the other members of the\r\nlegislature, had barely time to get out of his way. Mr. Jefferson sent\r\noff his family, to secure them from danger, and was himself still at\r\nMonticello, making arrangements for his own departure, when Lieutenant\r\nHudson arrived there at half speed, and informed him the enemy were then\r\nascending the hill of Monticello. He departed immediately, and knowing\r\nthat he would be pursued if he took the high road, he plunged into the\r\nwoods of the adjoining mountain, where, being at once safe, he proceeded\r\nto overtake his family. This is the famous adventure of Carter’s\r\nMountain, which has been so often resounded through the slanderous\r\nchronicles of Federalism. But they have taken care never to detail the\r\nfacts, lest these should show that this favorite charge amounted to\r\nnothing more, than that he did not remain in his house, and there singly\r\nfight a whole troop of horse, or suffer himself to be taken prisoner.\r\nHaving accompanied his family one day’s journey, he returned to\r\nMonticello. Tarleton had retired after eighteen hours’ stay in\r\nCharlottesville. Mr. Jefferson then rejoined his family, and proceeded\r\nwith them to an estate he had in Bedford, about eighty miles southwest,\r\nwhere, riding in his farm some time after, he was thrown from his horse,\r\nand disabled from riding on horseback for a considerable time. But Mr.\r\nTurner finds it more convenient to give him this fall in his retreat\r\nbefore Tarleton, which had happened some weeks before, as a proof that\r\nhe withdrew from a troop of horse with a precipitancy which Don Quixote\r\nwould not have practised.\r\n\r\nThe facts here stated most particularly, with date of time and place,\r\nare taken from the notes made by the writer hereof, for his own\r\nsatisfaction, at the time: the others are from memory, but so well\r\nrecollected, that he is satisfied there is no material fact misstated.\r\nShould any person undertake to contradict any particular, on evidence\r\nwhich may at all merit the public respect, the writer will take the\r\ntrouble (though not at all in the best situation for it) to produce the\r\nproofs in support of it. He finds, indeed, that, of the persons whom he\r\nrecollects to have been present on these occasions, few have survived\r\nthe intermediate lapse of four and twenty years. Yet he trusts that\r\nsome, as well as himself, are yet among the living; and he is positively\r\ncertain, that no man can falsify any material fact here stated. He well\r\nremembers, indeed, that there were then, as there are at all times,\r\nsome who blamed every thing done contrary to their own opinion, although\r\ntheir opinions were formed on a very partial knowledge of facts. The\r\ncensures, which have been hazarded by such men as Mr. Turner, are\r\nnothing but revivals of these half-informed opinions. Mr. George\r\nNicholas, then a very young man, but always a very honest one, was\r\nprompted by these persons to bring specific charges against Mr.\r\nJefferson. The heads of these, in writing, were communicated through a\r\nmutual friend to Mr. Jefferson, who committed to writing also the\r\nheads of justification on each of them. I well remember this paper, and\r\nbelieve the original of it still exists; and though framed when every\r\nreal fact was fresh in the knowledge of every one, this fabricated\r\nflight from Richmond was not among the charges stated in this paper, nor\r\nany charge against Mr. Jefferson for not fighting, singly, the troop of\r\nhorse. Mr. Nicholas candidly relinquished further proceeding. The House\r\nof Representatives of Virginia pronounced an honorable sentence of\r\nentire approbation of Mr. Jefferson’s conduct, and so much the more\r\nhonorable, as themselves had been witnesses to it. And Mr. George\r\nNicholas took a conspicuous occasion afterwards, of his own free will,\r\nand when the matter was entirely at rest, to retract publicly the\r\nerroneous opinions he had been led into on that occasion, and to make\r\njust reparation by a candid acknowledgment of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXV.--TO DOCTORS ROGERS AND SLAUGHTER, March 2, 1806\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTORS ROGERS AND SLAUGHTER.\r\n\r\nWashington, March 2, 1806.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,\r\n\r\nI have received the favor of your letter of February the 2nd, and read\r\nwith thankfulness its obliging expressions respecting myself. I regret\r\nthat the object of a letter from persons whom I so much esteem, and\r\npatronized by so many other respectable names, should be beyond the\r\nlaw which a mature consideration of circumstances has prescribed for my\r\nconduct. I deem it the duty of every man to devote a certain portion of\r\nhis income for charitable purposes; and that it is his further duty to\r\nsee it so applied as to do the most good of which it is capable. This\r\nI believe to be best insured, by keeping within the circle of his own\r\ninquiry and information, the subjects of distress to whose relief his\r\ncontributions shall be applied. If this rule be reasonable in private\r\nlife, it becomes so necessary in my situation, that to relinquish it\r\nwould leave me without rule or compass. The applications of this kind\r\nfrom different parts of our own, and from foreign countries, are far\r\nbeyond any resources within my command. The mission of Serampore, in the\r\nEast Indies, the object of the present application, is but one of many\r\nitems. However disposed the mind may feel to unlimited good, our means\r\nhaving limits, we are necessarily circumscribed by them. They are too\r\nnarrow to relieve even the distresses under our own eye: and to desert\r\nthese for others which we neither see nor know, is to omit doing a\r\ncertain good for one which is uncertain. I know, indeed, there have\r\nbeen splendid associations for effecting benevolent purposes in remote\r\nregions of the earth. But no experience of their effect has proved that\r\nmore good would not have been done by the same means employed nearer\r\nhome. In explaining, however, my own motives of action, I must not be\r\nunderstood as impeaching those of others. Their views are those of\r\nan expanded liberality. Mine may be too much restrained by the law of\r\nusefulness. But it is a law to me, and with minds like yours, will be\r\nfelt as a justification. With this apology, I pray you to accept my\r\nsalutations, and assurances of high esteem and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXVI.--TO MR. DUANE, March 22, 1806\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. DUANE.\r\n\r\nWashington, March 22, 1806.\r\n\r\nI thank you, my good Sir, cordially, for your letter of the 12th; which,\r\nhowever, I did not receive till the 20th. It is a proof of sincerity,\r\nwhich I value above all things; as, between those who practise it,\r\nfalsehood and malice work their efforts in vain. There is an enemy\r\nsomewhere endeavoring to sow discord among us. Instead of listening\r\nfirst, then doubting, and lastly believing anile tales handed round\r\nwithout an atom of evidence, if my friends will address themselves to\r\nme directly, as you have done, they shall be informed with frankness\r\nand thankfulness. There is not a truth on earth which I fear or would\r\ndisguise. But secret slanders cannot be disarmed, because they are\r\nsecret. Although you desire no answer, I shall give you one to those\r\narticles admitting a short answer, reserving those which require more\r\nexplanation than the compass of a letter admits, to conversation on your\r\narrival here. And as I write this for your personal satisfaction, I\r\nrely that my letter will, under no circumstances, be communicated to any\r\nmortal, because you well know how every syllable from me is distorted by\r\nthe ingenuity of political enemies.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, then, I have had less communication, directly or\r\nindirectly, with the republicans of the east, this session, than I ever\r\nhad before. This has proceeded from accidental circumstances, not from\r\ndesign. And if there be any coolness between those of the south and\r\nmyself, it has not been from me towards them. Certainly there has been\r\nno other reserve, than to avoid taking part in the divisions among\r\nour friends. That Mr. R. has openly attacked the administration is\r\nsufficiently known. We were not disposed to join in league with Britain,\r\nunder any belief that she is fighting for the liberties of mankind,\r\nand to enter into war with Spain, and consequently France. The House of\r\nRepresentatives were in the same sentiment, when they rejected Mr. R.’s\r\nresolutions for raising a body of regular troops for the western\r\nservice. We are for a peaceable accommodation with all those nations, if\r\nit can be effected honorably. This, perhaps, is not the only ground\r\nof his alienation; but which side retains its orthodoxy, the vote of\r\neighty-seven to eleven republicans may satisfy you: but you will better\r\nsatisfy yourself on coming here, where alone the true state of things\r\ncan be known, and where you will see republicanism as solidly embodied\r\non all essential points, as you ever saw it on any occasion.\r\n\r\nThat there is only one minister who is not opposed to me, is\r\ntotally unfounded. There never was a more harmonious, a more cordial\r\nadministration, nor ever a moment when it has been otherwise. And while\r\ndifferences of opinion have been always rare among us, I can affirm,\r\nthat as to present matters, there was not a single paragraph in my\r\nmessage to Congress, or those supplementary to it, in which there was\r\nnot a unanimity of concurrence in the members of the administration. The\r\nfact is, that in ordinary affairs every head of a department consults me\r\non those of his department, and where any thing arises too difficult or\r\nimportant to be decided between us, the consultation becomes general.\r\n\r\nThat there is an ostensible cabinet and a concealed one, a public\r\nprofession and concealed counteraction, is false.\r\n\r\nThat I have denounced republicans by the epithet of Jacobins, and\r\ndeclared I would appoint none but those called moderates of both\r\nparties, and that I have avowed or entertain any predilection for those\r\ncalled the third party, or Quids, is in every tittle of it false.\r\n\r\nThat the expedition of Miranda was countenanced by me is an absolute\r\nfalsehood, let it have gone from whom it might; and I am satisfied it is\r\nequally so as to Mr. Madison. To know as much of it as we could was our\r\nduty, but not to encourage it.\r\n\r\nOur situation is difficult; and whatever we do, is liable to the\r\ncriticisms of those who wish to represent it awry. If we recommend\r\nmeasures in a public message, it may be said that members are not sent\r\nhere to obey the mandates of the President, or to register the edicts\r\nof a sovereign. If we express opinions in conversation, we have then our\r\nCharles Jenkinsons, and back-door counsellors. If we say nothing, ‘we\r\nhave no opinions, no plans, no cabinet.’ In truth, it is the fable of\r\nthe old man, his son, and ass, over again.\r\n\r\nThese are short facts, which may suffice to inspire you with caution,\r\nuntil you can come here and examine for yourself. No other information\r\ncan give you a true insight into the state of things; but you will have\r\nno difficulty in understanding them when on the spot. In the mean time,\r\naccept my friendly salutations and cordial good wishes.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXVII.--TO WILSON C. NICHOLAS, March 24,1806\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILSON C. NICHOLAS.--[Confidential.]\r\n\r\nWashington, March 24,1806.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nA last effort at friendly settlement with Spain is proposed to be made\r\nat Paris, and under the auspices of France. For this purpose, General\r\nArmstrong and Mr. Bowdoin (both now at Paris) have been appointed joint\r\ncommissioners: but such a cloud of dissatisfaction rests on General\r\nArmstrong in the minds of many persons, on account of a late occurrence\r\nstated in all the public papers, that we have in contemplation to add\r\na third commissioner, in order to give the necessary measure of public\r\nconfidence to the commission. Of these two gentlemen, one being of\r\nMassachusetts and one of new York, it is thought the third should be\r\na southern man; and the rather, as the interests to be negotiated\r\nare almost entirely southern and western. This addition is not yet\r\nultimately decided on; but I am inclined to believe it will be adopted.\r\nUnder this expectation, and my wish that you may be willing to undertake\r\nit, I give you the earliest possible intimation of it, that you may\r\nbe preparing both your mind and your measures for the mission. The\r\ndeparture would be required to be very prompt; though the absence,\r\nI think, will not be long, Bonaparte not being in the practice of\r\nprocrastination. This particular consideration will, I hope, reconcile\r\nthe voyage to your affairs and your feelings. The allowance to an extra\r\nmission, is salary from the day of leaving home, and expenses to\r\nthe place of destination, or in lieu of the latter, and to avoid\r\nsettlements, a competent fixed sum may be given. For the return, a\r\ncontinuance of the salary for three months after fulfilment of the\r\ncommission. Be so good as to make up your mind as quickly as possible,\r\nand to answer me as early as possible. Consider the measure as proposed\r\nprovisionally only, and not to be communicated to any mortal until we\r\nsee it proper. Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXVIII.--TO WILSON C. NICHOLAS, April 13, 1806\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILSON C. NICHOLAS.\r\n\r\nWashington, April 13, 1806.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nThe situation of your affairs certainly furnishes good cause for your\r\nnot acceding to my proposition of a special mission to Europe. My only\r\nhope had been, that they could have gone on one summer without you.\r\nAn unjust hostility against General Armstrong will, I am afraid,\r\nshow itself whenever any treaty made by him shall be offered for\r\nratification. I wished, therefore, to provide against this, by joining a\r\nperson who would have united the confidence of the whole Senate. General\r\nSmith was so prominent in the opposition to Armstrong, that it would be\r\nimpossible for them to act together. We conclude, therefore, to leave\r\nthe matter with Armstrong and Bowdoin. Indeed, my dear Sir, I wish\r\nsincerely you were back in the Senate; and that you would take the\r\nnecessary measures to get yourself there. Perhaps, as a preliminary, you\r\nshould go to our legislature. Giles’s absence has been a most serious\r\nmisfortune. A majority of the Senate means well. But Tracy and Bayard\r\nare too dexterous for them, and have very much influenced their\r\nproceedings. Tracy has been of nearly every committee during the\r\nsession, and for the most part the chairman, and of course drawer of the\r\nreports. Seven federalists voting always in phalanx, and joined by some\r\ndiscontented republicans, some oblique ones, some capricious, have so\r\noften made a majority, as to produce very serious embarrassment to the\r\npublic operations; and very much do I dread the submitting to them, at\r\nthe next session, any treaty which can be made with either England or\r\nSpain, when I consider that five joining the federalists, can defeat a\r\nfriendly settlement of our affairs. The House of Representatives is as\r\nwell disposed as I ever saw one. The defection of so prominent a leader\r\nthrew them into dismay and confusion for a moment; but they soon rallied\r\nto their own principles, and let him go off with five or six followers\r\nonly. One half of these are from Virginia. His late declaration of\r\nperpetual opposition to this administration, drew off a few others, who\r\nat first had joined him, supposing his opposition occasional only,\r\nand not systematic. The alarm the House has had from this schism, has\r\nproduced a rallying together, and a harmony, which carelessness and\r\nsecurity had begun to endanger. On the whole, this little trial of the\r\nfirmness of our representatives in their principles, and that of the\r\npeople also, which is declaring itself in support of their public\r\nfunctionaries, has added much to my confidence in the stability of our\r\ngovernment; and to my conviction, that should things go wrong at any\r\ntime, the people will set them to rights by the peaceable exercise of\r\ntheir elective rights. To explain to you the character of this schism,\r\nits objects and combinations, can only be done in conversation; and\r\nmust be deferred till I see you at Monticello, where I shall probably\r\nbe about the 10th or 12th of May, to pass the rest of the month there.\r\nCongress has agreed to rise on Monday the 21st.\r\n\r\nAccept my affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXIX.--TO MR. HARRIS, April 18, 1806\r\n\r\nTO MR. HARRIS.\r\n\r\nWashington, April 18, 1806.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nIt is now some time since I received from you, through the house of\r\nSmith and Buchanan, at Baltimore, a bust of the Emperor Alexander,\r\nfor which I have to return you my thanks. These are the more cordial,\r\nbecause of the value the bust derives from the great estimation in which\r\nits original is held by the world, and by none more than by myself.\r\nIt will constitute one of the most valued ornaments of the retreat I am\r\npreparing for myself at my native home. Accept, at the same time, my\r\nacknowledgments for the elegant work of Atkinson and Walker on the\r\ncustoms of the Russians. I had laid it down as a law for my conduct\r\nwhile in office, and hitherto scrupulously observed, to accept of no\r\npresent beyond a book, a pamphlet, or other curiosity of minor value;\r\nas well to avoid imputations on my motives of action, as to shut out\r\na practice susceptible of such abuse. But my particular esteem for the\r\ncharacter of the Emperor places his image in my mind above the scope of\r\nlaw. I receive it, therefore, and shall cherish it with affection. It\r\nnourishes the contemplation of all the good placed in his power, and of\r\nhis disposition to do it.\r\n\r\nA little before Dr. Priestley’s death, he informed me that he had\r\nreceived intimations, through a channel he confided in, that the\r\nEmperor entertained a wish to know something of our constitution. I have\r\ntherefore selected the two best works we have on that subject, for which\r\nI pray you to ask a place in his library. They are too much in detail to\r\noccupy his time; but they will furnish materials for an abstract, to\r\nbe made by others, on such a scale as may bring the matter within the\r\ncompass of the time which his higher callings can yield to such an\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nAt a very early period of my life, contemplating the history of the\r\naboriginal inhabitants of America, I was led to believe that if there\r\nhad ever been a relation between them and the men of color in Asia,\r\ntraces of it would be found in their several languages. I have therefore\r\navailed myself of every opportunity which has offered, to obtain\r\nvocabularies of such tribes as have been within my reach, corresponding\r\nto a list then formed of about two hundred and fifty words. In this I\r\nhave made such progress, that within a year or two more I think to give\r\nto the public what I then shall have acquired. I have lately seen a\r\nreport of Mr. Volney’s to the Celtic Academy, on a work of Mr. Pallas,\r\nentitled _Vocabulaires Comparés des Langues de toute la Terre_; with\r\na list of one hundred and thirty words, to which the vocabulary is\r\nlimited. I find that seventy-three of these words are common to that\r\nand to my vocabulary, and therefore will enable us, by a comparison of\r\nlanguage, to make the inquiry so long desired, as to the probability\r\nof a common origin between the people of color of the two continents. I\r\nhave to ask the favor of you to procure me a copy of the above work of\r\nPallas, to inform me of the cost, and permit me to pay it here to your\r\nuse; for I presume you have some mercantile correspondent here, to whom\r\na payment can be made for you. A want of knowledge what the book may\r\ncost, as well as of the means of making so small a remittance, obliges\r\nme to make this proposition, and to restrain it to the sole condition\r\nthat I be permitted to reimburse it here.\r\n\r\nI enclose you a letter for the Emperor, which be pleased to deliver or\r\nhave delivered: it has some relation to a subject which the Secretary of\r\nState will explain to you.\r\n\r\nAccept my salutations, and assurances of esteem and consideration.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXX.--TO THE EMPEROR OF RUSSIA\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE EMPEROR OF RUSSIA.\r\n\r\nWashington, April 19, 1806.\r\n\r\nI owe an acknowledgment to your Imperial Majesty, of the great\r\nsatisfaction I have received from your letter of August the 20th, 1805,\r\nand sincere expressions of the respect and veneration I entertain for\r\nyour character. It will be among the latest and most soothing comforts\r\nof my life, to have seen advanced to the government of so extensive a\r\nportion of the earth, and at so early a period of his life, a sovereign,\r\nwhose ruling passion is the advancement of the happiness and prosperity\r\nof his people; and not of his own people only, but who can extend his\r\neye and his good will to a distant and infant nation, unoffending in its\r\ncourse, unambitious in its views.\r\n\r\nThe events of Europe come to us so late, and so suspiciously, that\r\nobservations on them would certainly be stale, and possibly wide of\r\ntheir actual state. From their general aspect, however, I collect\r\nthat your Majesty’s interposition in them has been disinterested and\r\ngenerous, and having in view only the general good of the great\r\nEuropean family. When you shall proceed to the pacification which is to\r\nre-establish peace and commerce, the same dispositions of mind will lead\r\nyou to think of the general intercourse of nations, and to make that\r\nprovision for its future maintenance, which, in times past, it has so\r\nmuch needed. The northern nations of Europe, at the head of which your\r\nMajesty is distinguished, are habitually peaceable. The United States\r\nof America, like them, are attached to peace. We have then with them\r\na common interest in the neutral rights. Every nation, indeed, on the\r\ncontinent of Europe, belligerent as well as neutral, is interested in\r\nmaintaining these rights, in liberalizing them progressively with the\r\nprogress of science and refinement of morality, and in relieving\r\nthem from restrictions which the extension of the arts has long since\r\nrendered unreasonable and vexatious.\r\n\r\nTwo personages in Europe, of which your Majesty is one, have it in their\r\npower, at the approaching pacification, to render eminent service to\r\nnations in general, by incorporating into the act of pacification, a\r\ncorrect definition of the rights of neutrals on the high seas. Such\r\na definition, declared by all the powers lately or still belligerent,\r\nwould give to those rights a precision and notoriety, and cover them\r\nwith an authority, which would protect them in an important degree\r\nagainst future violation; and should any further sanction be necessary,\r\nthat of an exclusion of the violating nation from commercial intercourse\r\nwith all the others, would be preferred to war, as more analogous to\r\nthe offence, more easy and likely to be executed with good faith. The\r\nessential articles of these rights, too, are so few and simple as easily\r\nto be defined.\r\n\r\nHaving taken no part in the past or existing troubles of Europe, we have\r\nno part to act in its pacification. But as principles may then be settled\r\nin which we have a deep interest, it is a great happiness for us that\r\nthey are placed under the protection of an umpire, who, looking beyond\r\nthe narrow bounds of an individual nation, will take under the cover of\r\nhis equity the rights of the absent and unrepresented. It is only by a\r\nhappy concurrence of good characters and good occasions, that a step\r\ncan now and then be taken to advance the well being of nations. If the\r\npresent occasion be good, I am sure your Majesty’s character will not be\r\nwanting to avail the world of it. By monuments of such good offices may\r\nyour life become an epoch in the history of the condition of man, and\r\nmay He who called it into being for the good of the human family, give\r\nit length of days and success, and have it always in his holy keeping.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXI.--TO COLONEL MONROE, May 4, 1806\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\nWashington, May 4, 1806.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI wrote you on the 16th of March by a common vessel, and then expected\r\nto have had, on the rising of Congress, an opportunity of peculiar\r\nconfidence to you. Mr. Beckley then supposed he should take a flying\r\ntrip to London, on private business. But I believe he does not find it\r\nconvenient. He could have let you into the _arcana rerum_, which you\r\nhave interests in knowing. Mr. Pinckney’s pursuits having been confined\r\nto his peculiar line, he has only that general knowledge of what has\r\npassed here, which the public possess. He has a just view of things so\r\nfar as known to him. Our old friend, Mercer, broke off from us some time\r\nago, at first professing to disdain joining the federalists, yet from\r\nthe habit of voting together, becoming soon identified with them.\r\nWithout carrying over with him one single person, he is now in a state\r\nof as perfect obscurity as if his name had never been known. Mr. J.\r\nRandolph is in the same track, and will end in the same way. His course\r\nhas excited considerable alarm. Timid men consider it as a proof of the\r\nweakness of our government, and that it is to be rent into pieces by\r\ndemagogues and to end in anarchy. I survey the scene with a different\r\neye, and draw a different augury from it. In a House of Representatives\r\nof a great mass of good sense, Mr. Randolph’s popular eloquence gave him\r\nsuch advantages as to place him unrivalled as the leader of the House;\r\nand, although not conciliatory to those whom he led, principles of duty\r\nand patriotism induced many of them to swallow humiliations he subjected\r\nthem to, and to vote as was right, as long as he kept the path of right\r\nhimself. The sudden defection of such a man could not but produce a\r\nmomentary astonishment, and even dismay; but for a moment only. The\r\ngood sense of the House rallied around its principles, and, without any\r\nleader, pursued steadily the business of the session, did it well, and\r\nby a strength of vote which has never before been seen. Upon all trying\r\nquestions, exclusive of the federalists, the minority of republicans\r\nvoting with him, has been from four to six or eight, against from\r\nninety to one hundred; and although he yet treats the federalists with\r\nineffable contempt, yet having declared eternal opposition to this\r\nadministration, and consequently associated with them in his votes, he\r\nwill, like Mercer, end with them. The augury I draw from this is that\r\nthere is a steady good sense in the legislature, and in the body of the\r\nnation, joined with good intentions, which will lead them to discern and\r\nto pursue the public good under all circumstances which can arise, and\r\nthat no _ignis faiuus_ will be able to lead them long astray. In the\r\npresent case, the public sentiment, as far as declarations of it have\r\nyet come in, is, without a single exception, in firm adherence to the\r\nadministration. One popular paper is endeavoring to maintain equivocal\r\nground; approving the administration in all its proceedings, and\r\nMr. Randolph in all those which have heretofore merited approbation,\r\ncarefully avoiding to mention his late aberration. The ultimate view of\r\nthis paper is friendly to you, and the editor, with more judgment than\r\nhim who assumes to be at the head of your friends, sees that the ground\r\nof opposition to the administration is not that on which it would be\r\nadvantageous to you to be planted. The great body of your friends are\r\namong the firmest adherents to the administration, and in their support\r\nof you will suffer Mr. Randolph to have no communications with them. My\r\nformer letter told you the line which both duty and inclination would\r\nlead me sacredly to pursue. But it is unfortunate for you, to be\r\nembarrassed with such a _soi-disant_ friend. You must not commit\r\nyourself to him. These views may assist you to understand such details\r\nas Mr. Pinckney will give you. If you are here at any time before the\r\nfall, it will be in time for any object you may have, and by that time\r\nthe public sentiment will be more decisively declared. I wish you were\r\nhere at present, to take your choice of the two governments of Orleans\r\nand Louisiana, in either of which I could now place you; and I verily\r\nbelieve it would be to your advantage to be just that much withdrawn\r\nfrom the focus of the ensuing contest, until its event should be known.\r\nThe one has a salary of five thousand dollars, the other of two thousand\r\ndollars; both with excellent hotels for the Governor. The latter at St.\r\nLouis, where there is good society, both French and American, a healthy\r\nclimate, and the finest field in the United States for acquiring\r\nproperty. The former not unhealthy, if you begin a residence there\r\nin the month of November. The Mrs. Trists and their connections are\r\nestablished there. As I think you can within four months inform me what\r\nyou say to this, I will keep things in their present state till the last\r\nday of August, for your answer.\r\n\r\nThe late change in the ministry I consider as insuring us a just\r\nsettlement of our differences, and we ask no more. In Mr. Fox,\r\npersonally, I have more confidence than in any man in England, and it\r\nis founded in what, through unquestionable channels, I have had\r\nopportunities of knowing of his honesty and his good sense. While he\r\nshall be in the administration, my reliance on that government will be\r\nsolid. We had committed ourselves in a line of proceedings adapted to\r\nmeet Mr. Pitt’s policy and hostility, before we heard of his death,\r\nwhich self-respect did not permit us to abandon afterwards; and the late\r\nunparalleled outrage on us at New York excited such sentiments in the\r\npublic at large, as did not permit us to do less than has been done. It\r\nought not to be viewed by the ministry as looking towards them at all,\r\nbut merely as the consequences of the measures of their predecessors,\r\nwhich their nation has called on them to correct. I hope, therefore,\r\nthey will come to just arrangements. No two countries upon earth have so\r\nmany points of common interest and friendship; and their rulers must\r\nbe great bunglers indeed, if, with such dispositions, they break them\r\nasunder. The only rivalry that can arise, is on the ocean. England\r\nmay by petty larceny thwartings check us on that element a little, but\r\nnothing she can do will retard us there one year’s growth. We shall be\r\nsupported there by other nations, and thrown into their scale to make a\r\npart of the great counterpoise to her navy. If, on the other hand, she\r\nis just to us, conciliatory, and encourages the sentiment of family\r\nfeelings and conduct, it cannot fail to befriend the security of both.\r\nWe have the seamen and materials for fifty ships of the line, and half\r\nthat number of frigates, and were France to give us the money, and\r\nEngland the dispositions to equip them, they would give to England\r\nserious proofs of the stock from which they are sprung, and the\r\nschool in which they have been taught, and added to the efforts of the\r\nimmensity of sea-coast lately united under one power, would leave the\r\nstate of the ocean no longer problematical. Were, on the other hand,\r\nEngland to give the money, and France the dispositions to place us\r\non the sea in all our force, the whole world, out of the continent\r\nof Europe, might be our joint monopoly. We wish for neither of these\r\nscenes. We ask for peace and justice from all nations, and we will\r\nremain uprightly neutral in fact, though leaning in belief to the\r\nopinion that an English ascendancy on the ocean is safer for us than\r\nthat of France. We begin to broach the idea that we consider the whole\r\nGulf Stream as of our waters, in which hostilities and cruising are to\r\nbe frowned on for the present, and prohibited so soon as either consent\r\nor force will permit us. We shall never permit another privateer to\r\ncruise within it, and shall forbid our harbors to national cruisers.\r\nThis is essential for our tranquillity and commerce. Be so good as to\r\nhave the enclosed letters delivered, to present me to your family, and\r\nbe assured yourself of my unalterable friendship.\r\n\r\nFor fear of accidents I shall not make the unnecessary addition of my\r\nname.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXII.--TO GENERAL SMITH, May 4,1806\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL SMITH.\r\n\r\nWashington, May 4,1806.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI received your favor covering some papers from General Wilkinson. I\r\nhave repented but of one appointment there, that of Lucas, whose temper\r\nI see overrules every good quality and every qualification he has. Not a\r\nsingle fact has appeared, which occasions me to doubt that I could have\r\nmade a fitter appointment than General Wilkinson. One qualm of principle\r\nI acknowledge I do feel, I mean the union of the civil and military\r\nauthority. You remember that when I came into office, while we were\r\nlodging together at Conrad’s, he was pressed on me to be made Governor\r\nof the Mississippi territory; and that I refused it on that very\r\nprinciple. When, therefore, the House of Representatives took that\r\nground, I was not insensible to its having some weight. But in the\r\nappointment to Louisiana, I did not think myself departing from my own\r\nprinciple, because I consider it not as a civil government, but merely\r\na military station. The legislature had sanctioned that idea by the\r\nestablishment of the office of Commandant, in which were completely\r\nblended the civil and military powers. It seemed, therefore, that the\r\nGovernor should be in suit with them. I observed too, that the House of\r\nRepresentatives, on the very day they passed the stricture on this union\r\nof authorities, passed a bill making the Governor of Michigan, commander\r\nof the regular troops which should at any time be within his government.\r\nHowever, on the subject of General Wilkinson nothing is in contemplation\r\nat this time. We shall see what turn things take at home and abroad in\r\nthe course of the summer. Monroe has had a second conversation with Mr.\r\nFox, which gives me hopes that we shall have an amicable arrangement\r\nwith that government. Accept my friendly salutations, and assurances of\r\ngreat esteem and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXIII.--TO MR DIGGES, July 1, 1806\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON TO MR DIGGES.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson salutes Mr. Digges with friendship and respect, and\r\nsends him the newspapers received last night. He is sorry that only the\r\nlatter part of the particular publication which Mr. Digges wished to\r\nsee, is in them. He will be happy to see Mr. Digges and his friends on\r\nthe fourth of July, and to join in congratulations on the return of\r\nthe day which divorced us from the follies and crimes of Europe, from a\r\ndollar in the pound at least of six hundred millions sterling, and from\r\nall the ruin of Mr. Pitt’s administration. We, too, shall encounter\r\nfollies; but if great, they will be short, if long, they will be light:\r\nand the vigor of our country will get the better of them. Mr. Pitt’s\r\nfollies have been great, long, and inflicted on a body emaciated with\r\nage, and exhausted by excesses beyond its power to bear. July 1, 1806.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXIV.--TO MR. BIDWELL, July 5, 1806\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BIDWELL.\r\n\r\nWashington, July 5, 1806.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of June the 21st has been duly received. We have not as yet\r\nheard from General Skinner on the subject of his office. Three persons\r\nare proposed on the most respectable recommendations, and under\r\ncircumstances of such equality as renders it difficult to decide between\r\nthem. But it shall be done impartially. I sincerely congratulate you on\r\nthe triumph of republicanism in Massachusetts. The Hydra of Federalism\r\nhas now lost all its heads but two. Connecticut I think will soon follow\r\nMassachusetts. Delaware will probably remain what it ever has been, a\r\nmere county of England, conquered indeed, and held under by force, but\r\nalways disposed to counter-revolution. I speak of its majority only.\r\n\r\nOur information from London continues to give us hopes of an\r\naccommodation there on both the points of ‘accustomed commerce and\r\nimpressment.’ In this there must probably be some mutual concession,\r\nbecause we cannot expect to obtain every thing and yield nothing. But\r\nI hope it will be such an one as may be accepted. The arrival of the\r\nHornet in France is so recently known, that it will yet be some time\r\nbefore we learn our prospects there. Notwithstanding the efforts made\r\nhere, and made professedly to assassinate that negotiation in embryo, if\r\nthe good sense of Bonaparte should prevail over his temper, the present\r\nstate of things in Europe may induce him to require of Spain, that she\r\nshould do us justice at least. That he should require her to sell us\r\nEast Florida, we have no right to insist: yet there are not wanting\r\nconsiderations which may induce him to wish a permanent foundation for\r\npeace laid between us. In this treaty, whatever it shall be, our old\r\nenemies the federalists, and their new friends, will find enough to carp\r\nat. This is a thing of course, and I should suspect error where they\r\nfound no fault. The buzzard feeds on carrion only. Their rallying point\r\nis ‘war with France and Spain, and alliance with Great Britain’:\r\nand every thing is wrong with them which checks their new ardor to be\r\nfighting for the liberties of mankind; on the sea always excepted. There\r\none nation is to monopolize all the liberties of the others.\r\n\r\nI read, with extreme regret, the expressions of an inclination on your\r\npart to retire from Congress. I will not say that this time, more than\r\nall others, calls for the service of every man; but I will say,\r\nthere never was a time when the services of those who possess talents,\r\nintegrity, firmness, and sound judgment, were more wanted in Congress.\r\nSome one of that description is particularly wanted to take the lead in\r\nthe House of Representatives, to consider the business of the nation as\r\nhis own business, to take it up as if he were singly charged with it,\r\nand carry it through. I do not mean that any gentleman, relinquishing\r\nhis own judgment, should implicitly support all the measures of the\r\nadministration; but that, where he does not disapprove of them, he\r\nshould not suffer them to go off in sleep, but bring them to the\r\nattention of the House, and give them a fair chance. Where he\r\ndisapproves, he will of course leave them to be brought forward by those\r\nwho concur in the sentiment. Shall I explain my idea by an example? The\r\nclassification of the militia was communicated to General Varnum and\r\nyourself merely as a proposition, which, if you approved, it was trusted\r\nyou would support. I knew, indeed, that General Varnum was opposed to\r\nany thing which might break up the present organization of the militia:\r\nbut when so modified as to avoid this, I thought he might, perhaps,\r\nbe reconciled to it. As soon as I found it did not coincide with your\r\nsentiments, I could not wish you to support it; but using the same\r\nfreedom of opinion, I procured it to be brought forward elsewhere.\r\nIt failed there also, and for a time, perhaps, may not prevail: but a\r\nmilitia can never be used for distant service on any other plan; and\r\nBonaparte will conquer the world, if they do not learn his secret of\r\ncomposing armies of young men only, whose enthusiasm and health enable\r\nthem to surmount all obstacles. When a gentleman, through zeal for the\r\npublic service, undertakes to do the public business, we know that we\r\nshall hear the cant of backstairs counsellors. But we never heard this\r\nwhile the declaimer was himself a backstairs man, as he calls it, but in\r\nthe confidence and views of the administration, as may more properly and\r\nrespectfully be said. But if the members are to know nothing but what is\r\nimportant enough to be put into a public message, and indifferent enough\r\nto be made known to all the world; if the executive is to keep all\r\nother information to himself, and the House to plunge on in the dark, it\r\nbecomes a government of chance and not of design. The imputation was one\r\nof those artifices used to despoil an adversary of his most effectual\r\narms; and men of mind will place themselves above a gabble of this\r\norder. The last session of Congress was indeed an uneasy one for a time:\r\nbut as soon as the members penetrated into the views of those who were\r\ntaking a new course, they rallied in as solid a phalanx as I have\r\never seen act together. Indeed I have never seen a House of better\r\ndispositions.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nPerhaps I am not entitled to speak with so much frankness; but it\r\nproceeds from no motive which has not a right to your forgiveness.\r\nOpportunities of candid explanation are so seldom afforded me, that I\r\nmust not lose them when they occur. The information I receive from your\r\nquarter agrees with that from the south; that the late schism has made\r\nnot the smallest impression on the public, and that the seceders are\r\nobliged to give to it other grounds than those which we know to be the\r\ntrue ones. All we have to wish is, that, at the ensuing session, every\r\none may take the part openly which he secretly befriends. I recollect\r\nnothing new and true, worthy communicating to you. As for what is not\r\ntrue, you will always find abundance in the newspapers. Among other\r\nthings, are those perpetual alarms as to the Indians, for no one of\r\nwhich has there ever been the slightest ground. They are the suggestions\r\nof hostile traders, always wishing to embroil us with the Indians, to\r\nperpetuate their own extortionate commerce. I salute you with esteem and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXV.--TO MR. BOWDOIN, July 10, 1806\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BOWDOIN.\r\n\r\nWashington, July 10, 1806.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI believe that when you left America, the invention of the polygraph had\r\nnot yet reached Boston. It is for copying with one pen while you write\r\nwith the other, and without the least additional embarrassment or\r\nexertion to the writer. I think it the finest invention of the present\r\nage, and so much superior to the copying machine, that the latter will\r\nnever be continued a day by any one who tries the polygraph. It was\r\ninvented by a Mr. Hawkins of Frankford, near Philadelphia, who is now in\r\nEngland, turning it to good account. Knowing that you are in the habit\r\nof writing much, I have flattered myself that I could add acceptably to\r\nyour daily convenience by presenting you with one of these delightful\r\nmachines. I have accordingly had one made, and to be certain of its\r\nperfection I have used it myself some weeks, and have the satisfaction\r\nto find it the best one I have ever tried; and in the course of two\r\nyears’ daily use of them, I have had opportunities of trying several.\r\nAs a secretary, which copies for us what we write without the power\r\nof revealing it, I find it a most precious possession to a man in\r\npublic-business. I enclose directions for unpacking and using the\r\nmachine when you receive it; but the machine itself must await a special\r\nand sure conveyance under the care of some person going to Paris. It is\r\nready packed, and shall go by the first proper conveyance.\r\n\r\nAs we heard two or three weeks ago of the safe arrival of the Hornet\r\nat L’Orient, we are anxiously waiting to learn from you the first\r\nimpressions on her mission. If you can succeed in procuring us Florida,\r\nand a good western boundary, it will fill the American mind with joy.\r\nIt will secure to our fellow-citizens one of their most ardent wishes, a\r\nlong peace with Spain and France. For be assured, the object of war with\r\nthem and alliance with England, which, at the last session of Congress,\r\ndrew off from the republican band about half a dozen of its members,\r\nis universally reprobated by our native citizens from north to south. I\r\nhave never seen the nation stand more firm to its principles, or rally\r\nso firmly to its constituted authorities, and in reprobation of the\r\nopposition to them. With England, I think we shall cut off the resource\r\nof impressing our seamen to fight her battles, and establish the\r\ninviolability of our flag in its commerce with her enemies.\r\n\r\nWe shall thus become what we sincerely wish to be, honestly neutral, and\r\ntruly useful to both belligerents. To the one, by keeping open a market\r\nfor the consumption of her manufactures, while they are excluded\r\nfrom all the countries under the power of her enemy; to the other, by\r\nsecuring for her a safe carriage of all her productions, metropolitan\r\nor colonial, while her own means are restrained by her enemy, and may,\r\ntherefore, be employed in other useful pursuits. We are certainly more\r\nuseful friends to France and Spain as neutrals, than as allies. I hope\r\nthey will be sensible of it, and by a wise removal of all grounds of\r\nfuture misunderstanding to another age, enable you to present us such\r\nan arrangement, as will insure to our fellow-citizens long and permanent\r\npeace and friendship with them. With respect to our western boundary,\r\nyour instructions will be your guide. I will only add, as a comment\r\nto them, that we are attached to the retaining the Bay of St. Bernard,\r\nbecause it was the first establishment of the unfortunate La Sale, was\r\nthe cradle of Louisiana, and more incontestibly covered and conveyed to\r\nus by France, under that name, than any other spot in the country. This\r\nwill be secured to us by taking for our western boundary the Guadaloupe,\r\nand from its head around the sources of all waters eastward of it,\r\nto the highlands embracing the waters running into the Mississippi.\r\nHowever, all these things I presume will be settled before you receive\r\nthis; and I hope so settled as to give peace and satisfaction to us all.\r\n\r\nOur crops of wheat are greater than have ever been known, and are now\r\nnearly secured. A caterpillar gave for a while great alarm, but did\r\nlittle injury. Of tobacco, not half a crop has been planted for want\r\nof rain; and even this half, with cotton and Indian corn, has yet many\r\nchances to run.\r\n\r\nThis summer will place our harbors in a situation to maintain peace and\r\norder within them. The next, or certainly the one following that, will\r\nso provide them with gunboats and common batteries, as to be _hors\r\nd’insulte_. Although our prospect is peace, our policy and purpose is\r\nto provide for defence by all those means to which our resources are\r\ncompetent.\r\n\r\nI salute you with friendship, and assure you of my high respect and\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXVI.--TO W. A. BURWELL, September 17, 1806\r\n\r\n\r\nTO W. A. BURWELL.\r\n\r\nMonticello, September 17, 1806.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYours of August the 7th, from Liberty, never got to my hands till the\r\n9th instant. About the same time, I received the Enquirer in which\r\nDecius was so judiciously answered. The writer of that paper observed,\r\nthat the matter of Decius consisted, first of facts; secondly, of\r\ninferences from these facts: that he was not well enough informed to\r\naffirm or deny his facts, and he therefore examines his inferences,\r\nand in a very masterly manner shows that even were his facts true, the\r\nreasonable inferences from them are very different from those drawn by\r\nDecius. But his facts are far from truth, and should be corrected. It\r\nhappened that Mr. Madison and General Dearborn were here when I received\r\nyour letter. I therefore, with them, took up Decius and read him\r\ndeliberately; and our memories aided one another in correcting his bold\r\nand unauthorized assertions. I shall note the most material of them in\r\nthe order of the paper.\r\n\r\n1. It is grossly false that our ministers, as is said in a note,\r\nhad proposed to surrender our claims to compensation for Spanish\r\nspoliations, or even for French. Their instructions were to make no\r\ntreaty in which Spanish spoliations were not provided for; and although\r\nthey were permitted to be silent as to French spoliations carried into\r\nSpanish ports, they were not expressly to abandon even them. 2. It is\r\nnot true that our ministers, in agreeing to establish the Colorado as\r\nour western boundary, had been obliged to exceed the authority of their\r\ninstructions. Although we considered our title good as far as the\r\nRio Bravo, yet in proportion to what they could obtain east of the\r\nMississippi, they were to relinquish to the westward, and successive\r\nsacrifices were marked out, of which even the Colorado was not the last.\r\n3. It is not true that the Louisiana treaty was antedated, lest Great\r\nBritain should consider our supplying her enemies with money as a breach\r\nof neutrality. After the very words of the treaty were finally agreed\r\nto, it took some time, perhaps some days, to make out all the copies in\r\nthe very splendid manner of Bonaparte’s treaties. Whether the 30th of\r\nApril, 1803, the date expressed, was the day of the actual compact, or\r\nthat on which it was signed, our memories do not enable us to say. If\r\nthe former, then it is strictly conformable to the day of the compact;\r\nif the latter, then it was postdated, instead of being antedated. The\r\nmotive assigned, too, is as incorrect as the fact. It was so far from\r\nbeing thought, by any party, a breach of neutrality, that the British\r\nminister congratulated Mr. King on the acquisition, and declared that\r\nthe King had learned it with great pleasure: and when Baring, the\r\nBritish banker, asked leave of the minister to purchase the debt and\r\nfurnish the money to France, the minister declared to him, that so far\r\nfrom throwing obstacles in the way, if there were any difficulty in the\r\npayment of the money, it was the interest of Great Britain to aid it.\r\n4. He speaks of a double set of opinions and principles; the one\r\nostensible, to go on the journals and before the public, the other\r\nefficient, and the real motives to action. But where are these double\r\nopinions and principles? The executive informed the legislature of the\r\nwrongs of Spain, and that preparation should be made to repel them, by\r\nforce, if necessary. But as it might still be possible to negotiate\r\na settlement, they asked such means as might enable them to meet the\r\nnegotiation, whatever form it might take. The first part of this system\r\nwas communicated publicly, the second, privately; but both were equally\r\nofficial, equally involved the responsibility of the executive, and were\r\nequally to go on the journals. 5. That the purchase of the Floridas was\r\nin direct opposition to the views of the executive, as expressed in the\r\nPresident’s official communication. It was not in opposition even to the\r\npublic part of the communication, which did not recommend war, but only\r\nto be prepared for it. It perfectly harmonized with the private part,\r\nwhich asked the means of negotiation in such terms as covered the\r\npurchase of Florida as evidently as it was proper to speak it out. He\r\nspeaks of secret communications between the executive and members, of\r\nbackstairs influence, &tc.. But he never spoke of this while he and\r\nMr. Nicholson enjoyed it almost solely. But when he differed from the\r\nexecutive in a leading measure, and the executive, not submitting to\r\nhim, expressed their sentiments to others, the very sentiments (to wit,\r\nfor the purchase of Florida), which he acknowledges they expressed to\r\nhim, then he roars out upon backstairs influence. 6. The committee, he\r\nsays, forbore to recommend offensive measures. Is this true? Did not\r\nthey recommend the raising ------- regiments? Besides, if it was proper\r\nfor the committee to forbear recommending offensive measures, was it\r\nnot proper for the executive and legislature to exercise the same\r\nforbearance? 7. He says Monroe’s letter had a most important bearing on\r\nour Spanish relations. Monroe’s letter related, almost entirely, to our\r\nBritish relations. Of those with Spain he knew nothing particular since\r\nhe left that country. Accordingly, in his letter he simply expressed\r\nan opinion on our affairs with Spain, of which he knew we had better\r\ninformation than he could possess. His opinion was no more than that\r\nof any other sensible man; and his letter was proper to be communicated\r\nwith the English papers, and with them only. That the executive did not\r\nhold it up on account of any bearing on Spanish affairs, is evident from\r\nthe fact, that it was communicated when the Senate had not yet entered\r\non the Spanish affairs, and had not yet received the papers relating to\r\nthem from the other House. The moment the Representatives were ready to\r\nenter on the British affairs, Monroe’s letter, which peculiarly related\r\nto them, and was official solely as to them, was communicated to both\r\nHouses, the Senate being then about entering on the Spanish affairs.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nThese, my dear Sir, are the principal facts worth correction. Make any\r\nuse of them you think best, without letting your source of information\r\nbe known. Can you send me some cones or seeds of the cucumber-tree?\r\nAccept affectionate salutations, and assurances of great esteem and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXVII.--TO ALBERT GALLATIN, October 12, 1806\r\n\r\nTO ALBERT GALLATIN.\r\n\r\nWashington, October 12, 1806.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYou witnessed, in the earlier part of the administration, the malignant\r\nand long continued efforts which the federalists exerted in their\r\nnewspapers, to produce misunderstanding between Mr. Madison and myself.\r\nThese failed completely. A like attempt was afterwards made, through\r\nother channels, to effect a similar purpose between General Dearborn and\r\nmyself, but with no more success. The machinations of the last session\r\nto put you at cross questions with us all, were so obvious as to be seen\r\nat the first glance of every eye. In order to destroy one member of the\r\nadministration, the whole were to be set to loggerheads to destroy one\r\nanother. I observe in the papers lately, new attempts to revive this\r\nstale artifice, and that they squint more directly towards you and\r\nmyself. I cannot, therefore, be satisfied, till I declare to you\r\nexplicitly, that my affections and confidence in you are nothing\r\nimpaired, and that they cannot be impaired by means so unworthy the\r\nnotice of candid and honorable minds. I make the declaration, that no\r\ndoubts or jealousies, which often beget the facts they fear, may find a\r\nmoment’s harbor in either of our minds. I have so much reliance on the\r\nsuperior good sense and candor of all those associated with me, as to be\r\nsatisfied they will not suffer either friend or foe to sow tares among\r\nus. Our administration now drawing towards a close, I have a sublime\r\npleasure in believing it will be distinguished as much by having placed\r\nitself above all the passions which could disturb its harmony, as by the\r\ngreat operations by which it will have advanced the well-being of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nAccept my affectionate salutations, and assurances of my constant and\r\nunalterable respect and attachment.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXVIII.--TO JOHN DICKINSON, January 13, 1807\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN DICKINSON.\r\n\r\nWashington, January 13, 1807.\r\n\r\nMy Dear and Ancient Friend,\r\n\r\nI have duly received your favor of the 1st instant, and am ever thankful\r\nfor communications which may guide me in the duties which I wish to\r\nperform as well as I am able. It is but too true, that great discontents\r\nexist in the territory of Orleans. Those of the French inhabitants have\r\nfor their sources, 1. the prohibition of importing slaves. This may be\r\npartly removed by Congress permitting them to receive slaves from the\r\nother States, which, by dividing that evil, would lessen its danger. 2.\r\nThe administration of justice in our forms, principles, and language,\r\nwith all of which they are unacquainted, and are the more abhorrent,\r\nbecause of the enormous expense, greatly exaggerated by the corruption\r\nof bankrupt and greedy lawyers, who have gone there from the United\r\nStates and engrossed the practice. 3. The call on them by the land\r\ncommissioners to produce the titles of their lands. The object of this\r\nis really to record and secure their rights. But as many of them hold on\r\nrights so ancient that the title papers are lost, they expect the\r\nland is to be taken from them wherever they cannot produce a regular\r\ndeduction of title in writing. In this they will be undeceived by the\r\nfinal result, which will evince to them a liberal disposition of the\r\ngovernment towards them. Among the American inhabitants it is the old\r\ndivision of federalists and republicans. The former, are as hostile\r\nthere as they are every where, and are the most numerous and wealthy.\r\nThey have been long endeavoring to batter down the Governor, who has\r\nalways been a firm republican. There were characters superior to him,\r\nwhom I wished to appoint, but they refused the office: I know no better\r\nman who would accept of it, and it would not be right to turn him out\r\nfor one not better. But it is the second cause, above mentioned, which\r\nis deep seated and permanent. The French members of the legislature,\r\nbeing the majority in both Houses, lately passed an act, declaring\r\nthat the civil, or French laws, should be the laws of their land, and\r\nenumerated about fifty folio volumes, in Latin, as the depositories of\r\nthese laws. The Governor negatived the act. One of the Houses thereupon\r\npassed a vote for self-dissolution of the legislature as a useless body,\r\nwhich failed in the other House by a single vote only. They separated,\r\nhowever, and have disseminated all the discontent they could. I propose\r\nto the members of Congress in conversation, the enlisting thirty\r\nthousand volunteers, Americans by birth, to be carried at the public\r\nexpense, and settled immediately on a bounty of one hundred and\r\nsixty acres of land each, on the west side of the Mississippi, on the\r\ncondition of giving two years of military service, if that country\r\nshould be attacked within seven years. The defence of the country would\r\nthus be placed on the spot, and the additional number would entitle the\r\nterritory to become a State, would make the majority American, and make\r\nit an American instead of a French State. This would not sweeten the\r\npill to the French; but in making that acquisition we had some view to\r\nour own good as well as theirs, and I believe the greatest good of both\r\nwill be promoted by whatever will amalgamate us together.\r\n\r\nI have tired you, my friend, with a long letter. But your tedium will\r\nend in a few lines more. Mine has yet two years to endure. I am tired\r\nof an office where I can do no more good than many others, who would be\r\nglad to be employed in it. To myself, personally, it brings nothing but\r\nunceasing drudgery, and daily loss of friends. Every office becoming\r\nvacant, every appointment made, _me donne un ingrat, et cent ennemis_.\r\nMy only consolation is in the belief, that my fellow-citizens at large\r\ngive me credit for good intentions. I will certainly endeavor to merit\r\nthe continuance of that good will which follows well intended actions,\r\nand their approbation will be the dearest reward I can carry into\r\nretirement.\r\n\r\nGod bless you, my excellent friend, and give you yet many healthy and\r\nhappy years.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXIX,--TO WILSON C. NICHOLAS, February 28,1807\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILSON C. NICHOLAS.\r\n\r\nWashington, February 28,1807.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour letter of January the 20th was received in due time. But such has\r\nbeen the constant pressure of business, that it has been out of my power\r\nto answer it. Indeed, the subjects of it would be almost beyond the\r\nextent of a letter, and as I hope to see you ere long at Monticello,\r\nit can then be more effectually done verbally. Let me observe, however,\r\ngenerally, that it is impossible for my friends ever to render me so\r\nacceptable a favor, as by communicating to me, without reserve, facts\r\nand opinions. I have none of that sort of self-love which winces at it;\r\nindeed, both self-love and the desire to do what is best strongly invite\r\nunreserved communication. There is one subject which will not admit a\r\ndelay till I see you. Mr. T. M. Randolph is, I believe, determined to\r\nretire from Congress, and it is strongly his wish, and that of all here,\r\nthat you should take his place. Never did the calls of patriotism more\r\nloudly assail you than at this moment. After excepting the federalists,\r\nwho will be twenty-seven, and the little band of schismatics, who\r\nwill be three or four (all tongue), the residue of the House of\r\nRepresentatives is as well disposed a body of men as I ever saw\r\ncollected. But there is no one whose talents and standing, taken\r\ntogether, have weight enough to give him the lead. The consequence is,\r\nthat there is no one who will undertake to do the public business, and\r\nit remains undone. Were you here, the whole would rally round you in an\r\ninstant, and willingly co-operate in whatever is for the public good.\r\nNor would it require you to undertake drudgery in the House. There are\r\nenough, able and willing to do that. A rallying point is all that is\r\nwanting. Let me beseech you then to offer yourself. You never will have\r\nit so much in your power again to render such eminent service.\r\n\r\nAccept my affectionate salutations and high esteem.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XL.--TO JAMES MONROE, March 21, 1807\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\nWashington, March 21, 1807.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nA copy of the treaty with Great Britain came to Mr. Erskine’s hands\r\non the last day of the session of Congress, which he immediately\r\ncommunicated to us; and since that, Mr. Purviance has arrived with\r\nan original. On the subject of it you will receive a letter from\r\nthe Secretary of State, of about this date, and one more in detail\r\nhereafter. I should not have written, but that I perceive uncommon\r\nefforts, and with uncommon wickedness, are making by the federal papers\r\nto produce mischief between myself, personally, and our negotiators; and\r\nalso to irritate the British government, by putting a thousand speeches\r\ninto my mouth, not one word of which I ever uttered. I have, therefore,\r\nthought it safe to guard you, by stating the view which we have given\r\nout on the subject of the treaty, in conversation and otherwise; for\r\nours, as you know, is a government which will not tolerate the being\r\nkept entirely in the dark, and especially on a subject so interesting\r\nas this treaty. We immediately stated in conversation, to the members\r\nof the legislature and others, that having, by a letter received in\r\nJanuary, perceived that our ministers might sign a treaty not providing\r\nsatisfactorily against the impressment of our seamen, we had, on the 3rd\r\nof February, informed you, that should such an one have been forwarded,\r\nit could not be ratified, and recommending, therefore, that you should\r\nresume negotiations for inserting an article to that effect; that we\r\nshould hold the treaty in suspense until we could learn from you the\r\nresult of our instructions, which probably would not be till summer,\r\nand then decide on the question of calling the Senate. We observed, too,\r\nthat a written declaration of the British commissioners, given in at\r\nthe time of signature, would of itself, unless withdrawn, prevent the\r\nacceptance of any treaty, because its effect was to leave us bound by\r\nthe treaty, and themselves totally unbound. This is the statement we\r\nhave given out, and nothing more of the contents of the treaty has been\r\nmade known. But depend on it, my dear Sir, that it will be considered as\r\na hard treaty when it is known. The British commissioners appear to\r\nhave screwed every article as far as it would bear, to have taken every\r\nthing, and yielded nothing. Take out the eleventh article, and the evil\r\nof all the others so much overweighs the good, that we should be glad to\r\nexpunge the whole. And even the eleventh article admits only that we\r\nmay enjoy our right to the indirect colonial trade, during the present\r\nhostilities. If peace is made this year, and war resumed the next, the\r\nbenefit of this stipulation is gone, and yet we are bound for ten years,\r\nto pass no non-importation or non-intercourse laws, nor take any\r\nother measures to restrain the unjust pretensions and practices of the\r\nBritish. But on this you will hear from the Secretary of State. If the\r\ntreaty cannot be put into an acceptable form, then the next best thing\r\nis to back out of the negotiation as well as we can, letting that die\r\naway insensibly; but, in the mean time, agreeing informally, that both\r\nparties shall act on the principles of the treaty, so as to preserve\r\nthat friendly understanding which we so sincerely desire, until the one\r\nor the other may be disposed to yield the points which divide us. This\r\nwill leave you to follow your desire of coming home, as soon as you see\r\nthat the amendment of the treaty is desperate. The power of\r\ncontinuing the negotiations will pass oyer to Mr. Pinckney, who, by\r\nprocrastinations, can let it die away, and give us time, the most\r\nprecious of all things to us. The government of New Orleans is still\r\nwithout such a head as I wish. The salary of five thousand dollars\r\nis too small; but I am assured the Orleans legislature would make it\r\nadequate, would you accept it. It is the second office in the United\r\nStates in importance, and I am still in hopes you will accept it. It is\r\nimpossible to let you stay at home while the public has so much need\r\nof talents. I am writing under a severe indisposition of periodical\r\nheadache, without scarcely command enough of my mind to know what\r\nI write. As a part of this letter concerns Mr. Pinckney as well as\r\nyourself, be so good as to communicate so much of it to him; and with\r\nmy best respects to him, to Mrs. Monroe, and your daughter, be assured\r\nyourself, in all cases, of my constant and affectionate friendship and\r\nattachment.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLI.--M. LE COMTE DIODATI, March 29, 1807\r\n\r\n\r\nM. LE COMTE DIODATI.\r\n\r\nWashington, March 29, 1807.\r\n\r\nMy Dear and Antient Friend,\r\n\r\nYour letter of August the 29th reached me the 18th of February. It\r\nenclosed a duplicate of that written from Brunswick five years before,\r\nbut which I never received, or had notice of, but by this duplicate. Be\r\nassured, my friend, that I was incapable of such negligence towards\r\nyou, as a failure to answer it would have implied. It would illy have\r\naccorded with those sentiments of friendship I entertained for you at\r\nParis, and which neither time nor distance has lessened. I often pass in\r\nreview the many happy hours I spent with Madame Diodati and yourself on\r\nthe banks of the Seine, as well as at Paris, and I count them among\r\nthe most pleasing I enjoyed in France. Those were indeed days of\r\ntranquillity and happiness. They had begun to cloud a little before I\r\nleft you; but I had no apprehension that the tempest, of which I saw the\r\nbeginning, was to spread over such an extent of space and time. I have\r\noften thought of you with anxiety, and wished to know how you weathered\r\nthe storm, and into what port you had retired. The letters now received\r\ngive me the first information, and I sincerely felicitate you on your\r\nsafe and quiet retreat. Were I in Europe, _pax et panis_ would certainly\r\nbe my motto. Wars and contentions, indeed, fill the pages of history\r\nwith more matter. But more blest is that nation whose silent course of\r\nhappiness furnishes nothing for history to say. This is what I ambition\r\nfor my own country, and what it has fortunately enjoyed now upwards of\r\ntwenty years, while Europe has been in constant volcanic eruption. I\r\nagain, my friend, repeat my joy that you have escaped the overwhelming\r\ntorrent of its lava.\r\n\r\nAt the end of my present term, of which two years are yet to come, I\r\npropose to retire from public life, and to close my days on my patrimony\r\nof Monticello, in the bosom of my family. I have hitherto enjoyed\r\nuniform health; but the weight of public business begins to be too heavy\r\nfor me, and I long for the enjoyments of rural life, among my books, my\r\nfarms, and my family. Having performed my _quadragena stipendia_, I\r\nam entitled to my discharge, and should be sorry, indeed, that others\r\nshould be sooner sensible than myself when I ought to ask it. I have,\r\ntherefore, requested my fellow-citizens to think of a successor for\r\nme, to whom I shall deliver the public concerns with greater joy than I\r\nreceived them. I have the consolation too of having added nothing to my\r\nprivate fortune, during my public service, and of retiring with hands\r\nas clean as they are empty. Pardon me these egoisms, which, if ever\r\nexcusable, are so when writing to a friend to whom our concerns are\r\nnot uninteresting. I shall always be glad to hear of your health and\r\nhappiness, and having been out of the way of hearing of any of our\r\ncotemporaries of the _corps diplomatique_ at Paris, any details of their\r\nsubsequent history, which you will favor me with, will be thankfully\r\nreceived. I pray you to make my friendly respects acceptable to Madame\r\nla Comtesse Diodati, to assure M. Tronchin of my continued esteem,\r\nand to accept yourself my affectionate salutations, and assurances of\r\nconstant attachment and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLII.--TO MR. BOWDOIN, April 2, 1807\r\n\r\nTO MR. BOWDOIN.\r\n\r\nWashington, April 2, 1807.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI wrote you on the 10th of July last; but neither your letter of October\r\nthe 20th nor that of November the 15th mentioning the receipt of it, I\r\nfear it has miscarried. I therefore now enclose a duplicate. As that was\r\nto go under cover of the Secretary of State’s despatches by any vessel\r\ngoing from our distant ports, I retained the polygraph therein mentioned\r\nfor a safer conveyance. None such has occurred till now, that the United\r\nStates’ armed brig the Wasp, on her way to the Mediterranean is to touch\r\nat Falmouth, with despatches for our ministers at London, and at Brest,\r\nwith others for yourself and General Armstrong.\r\n\r\nYou heard in due time from London of the signature of a treaty there\r\nbetween Great Britain and the United States. By a letter we received in\r\nJanuary from our ministers at London, we found they were making up\r\ntheir minds to sign a treaty, in which no provision was made against the\r\nimpressment of our seamen, contenting themselves with a note received\r\nin the course of their correspondence, from the British negotiators,\r\nassuring them of the discretion with which impressments should be\r\nconducted, which could be construed into a covenant only by inferences,\r\nagainst which its omission in the treaty was a strong inference; and in\r\nits terms totally unsatisfactory. By a letter of February the 3rd, they\r\nwere immediately informed that no treaty, not containing a satisfactory\r\narticle on that head, would be ratified, and desiring them to resume the\r\nnegotiations on that point. The treaty having come to as actually in the\r\ninadmissible shape apprehended, we, of course, hold it up until we know\r\nthe result of the instructions of February the 3rd. I have but little\r\nexpectation that the British government will retire from their habitual\r\nwrongs in the impressment of our seamen, and am certain, that without\r\nthat we will never tie up our hands by treaty, from the right of passing\r\na non-importation or non-intercourse act, to make it her interest to\r\nbecome just. This may bring on a war of commercial restrictions. To\r\nshow, however, the sincerity of our desire for conciliation, I have\r\nsuspended the non-importation act. This state of things should be\r\nunderstood at Paris, and every effort used on your part to accommodate\r\nour differences with Spain, under the auspices of France, with whom\r\nit is all-important that we should stand in terms of the strictest\r\ncordiality. In fact, we are to depend on her and Russia for the\r\nestablishment of neutral rights by the treaty of peace, among which\r\nshould be that of taking no persons by a belligerent out of a neutral\r\nship, unless they be the soldiers of an enemy. Never did a nation\r\nact towards another with more perfidy and injustice than Spain has\r\nconstantly practised against us: and if we have kept our hands off of\r\nher till now, it has been purely out of respect to France, and from the\r\nvalue we set on the friendship of France. We expect, therefore, from\r\nthe friendship of the Emperor, that he will either compel Spain to do us\r\njustice, or abandon her to us. We ask but one month to be in possession\r\nof the city of Mexico.\r\n\r\nNo better proof of the good faith of the United States could have\r\nbeen given, than the vigor with which we have acted, and the expense\r\nincurred, in suppressing the enterprise meditated lately by Burr against\r\nMexico. Although at first he proposed a separation of the western\r\ncountry, and on that ground received encouragement and aid from Yrujo,\r\naccording to the usual spirit of his government towards us, yet he very\r\nearly saw that the fidelity of the western country was not to be\r\nshaken, and turned himself wholly towards Mexico. And so popular is an\r\nenterprise on that country in this, that we had only to lie still, and\r\nhe would have had followers enough to have been in the city of Mexico\r\nin six weeks. You have doubtless seen my several messages to Congress,\r\nwhich gave a faithful narrative of that conspiracy. Burr himself, after\r\nbeing disarmed by our endeavors of all his followers, escaped from the\r\ncustody of the court of Mississippi, but was taken near Fort Stoddart,\r\nmaking his way to Mobile, by some country people, who brought him on\r\nas a prisoner to Richmond, where he is now under a course for trial.\r\nHitherto we have believed our law to be, that suspicion on probable\r\ngrounds was sufficient cause to commit a person for trial, allowing time\r\nto collect witnesses till the trial. But the judges here have decided,\r\nthat conclusive evidence of guilt must be ready in the moment of arrest,\r\nor they will discharge the malefactor. If this is still insisted on,\r\nBurr will be discharged; because his crimes having been sown from Maine,\r\nthrough the whole line of the western waters, to New Orleans, we cannot\r\nbring the witnesses here under four months. The fact is, that the\r\nfederalists make Burr’s cause their own, and exert their whole influence\r\nto shield him from punishment, as they did the adherents of Miranda. And\r\nit is unfortunate that federalism is still predominent in our judiciary\r\ndepartment, which is consequently in opposition to the legislative and\r\nexecutive branches, and is able to baffle their measures often.\r\n\r\nAccept my friendly salutations, and assurances of great esteem and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLIII.--TO WILLIAM B. GILES, April 20, 1807\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM B. GILES.\r\n\r\nMonticello, April 20, 1807.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of the 6th instant, on the subject of Burr’s offences, was\r\nreceived only four days ago. That there should be anxiety and doubt in\r\nthe public mind, in the present defective state of the proof, is not\r\nwonderful; and this has been sedulously encouraged by the tricks of the\r\njudges to force trials before it is possible to collect the evidence,\r\ndispersed through a line of two thousand miles from Maine to Orleans.\r\nThe federalists, too, give all their aid, making Burr’s cause their\r\nown, mortified only that he did not separate the union or overturn the\r\ngovernment, and proving, that had he had a little dawn of success, they\r\nwould have joined him to introduce his object, their favorite monarchy,\r\nas they would any other enemy, foreign or domestic, who could rid them\r\nof this hateful republic for any other government in exchange.\r\n\r\nThe first ground of complaint was the supine inattention of the\r\nadministration to a treason stalking through the land in open day. The\r\npresent one, that they have crushed it before it was ripe for execution,\r\nso that no overt acts can be produced. This last may be true; though I\r\nbelieve it is not. Our information having been chiefly by way of letter,\r\nwe do not know of a certainty yet what will be proved. We have set on\r\nfoot an inquiry through the whole of the country which has been the\r\nscene of these transactions, to be able to prove to the courts, if they\r\nwill give time, or to the public by way of communication to Congress,\r\nwhat the real facts have been. For obtaining this, we are obliged to\r\nappeal to the patriotism of particular persons in different places, of\r\nwhom we have requested to make the inquiry in their neighborhood, and on\r\nsuch information as shall be voluntarily offered. Aided by no process\r\nor facilities from the federal courts, but frowned on by their new-born\r\nzeal for the liberty of those whom we would not permit to overthrow\r\nthe liberties of their country, we can expect no revealments from the\r\naccomplices of the chief offender. Of treasonable intentions, the\r\njudges have been obliged to confess there is probable appearance. What\r\nloop-hole they will find in the case, when it comes to trial, we cannot\r\nforesee. Eaton, Stoddart, Wilkinson, and two others whom I must not\r\nname, will satisfy the world, if not the judges, of Burr’s guilt. And I\r\ndo suppose the following overt acts will be proved. 1. The enlistment\r\nof men, in a regular way. 2. The regular mounting of guard round\r\nBlannerhassett’s island, when they expected Governor Tiffin’s men to be\r\non them _modo guerrino arraiati_. 3. The rendezvous of Burr with his\r\nmen at the mouth of Cumberland. 4. His letter to the acting Governor of\r\nMississippi, holding up the prospect of civil war. 5. His capitulation,\r\nregularly signed with the aid of the Governor, as between two\r\nindependent and hostile commanders.\r\n\r\nBut a moment’s calculation will show that this evidence cannot be\r\ncollected under four months, probably five, from the moment of deciding\r\nwhen and where the trial shall be. I desired Mr. Rodney expressly to\r\ninform the Chief Justice of this, inofficially. But Mr. Marshall says,\r\n‘More than five weeks have elapsed since the opinion of the Supreme\r\nCourt has declared the necessity of proving the overt acts, if they\r\nexist. Why are they not proved.’ In what terms of decency can we\r\nspeak of this? As if an express could go to Natchez, or the mouth of\r\nCumberland, and return in five weeks, to do which has never taken less\r\nthan twelve. Again, ‘If, in November or December last, a body of\r\ntroops had been assembled on the Ohio, it is impossible to suppose the\r\naffidavits, establishing the fact, could not have been obtained by the\r\nlast of March.’ But I ask the Judge, where they should have been lodged?\r\nAt Frankfort? at Cincinnati? at Nashville? St. Louis? Natchez? New\r\nOrleans? These were the probable places of apprehension and examination.\r\nIt was not known at Washington till the 26th of March, that Burr would\r\nescape from the western tribunals, be retaken and brought to an eastern\r\none: and in five days after (neither five months nor five weeks, as the\r\nJudge calculated) he says, it is ‘impossible to suppose the affidavits\r\ncould not have been obtained.’ Where? At Richmond he certainly meant,\r\nor meant only to throw dust in the eyes of his audience. But all the\r\nprinciples of law are to be perverted which would bear on the\r\nfavorite offenders, who endeavor to overturn this odious republic. ‘I\r\nunderstand,’ says the Judge, ‘probable cause of guilt to be a case\r\nmade out of proof furnishing good reason to believe,’ &c. Speaking as a\r\nlawyer, he must mean legal proof, i.e. proof on oath, at least. But this\r\nis confounding probability and proof. We had always before understood\r\nthat where there was reasonable ground to believe guilt, the offender\r\nmust be put on his trial. That guilty intentions were probable, the\r\nJudge believed. And as to the overt acts, were not the bundle of letters\r\nof information in Mr. Rodney’s hands, the letters and facts published in\r\nthe local newspapers, Burr’s flight, and the universal belief or rumor\r\nof his guilt, probable ground for presuming the facts of enlistment,\r\nmilitary guard, rendezvous, threat of civil war, or capitulation, so as\r\nto put him on trial? Is there a candid man in the United States who\r\ndoes not believe some one, if not all, of these overt acts to have taken\r\nplace?\r\n\r\nIf there ever had been an instance in this or the preceding\r\nadministrations, of federal judges so applying principles of law as to\r\ncondemn a federal or acquit a republican offender, I should have judged\r\nthem in the present case with more charity. All this, however, will work\r\nwell. The nation will judge both the offender and judges for themselves.\r\nIf a member of the executive or legislature does wrong, the day is never\r\nfar distant when the people will remove him. They will see then, and\r\namend the error in our constitution, which makes any branch independent\r\nof the nation. They will see that one of the great co-ordinate branches\r\nof the government, setting itself in opposition to the other two, and\r\nto the common sense of the nation, proclaims impunity to that class\r\nof offenders which endeavors to overturn the constitution, and are\r\nthemselves protected in it by the constitution itself: for impeachment\r\nis a farce which will not be tried again. If their protection of Burr\r\nproduces this amendment, it will do more good than his condemnation\r\nwould have done. Against Burr, personally, I never had one hostile\r\nsentiment. I never, indeed, thought him an honest, frank-dealing man,\r\nbut considered him as a crooked gun, or other perverted machine, whose\r\naim or shot you could never be sure of. Still, while he possessed the\r\nconfidence of the nation, I thought it my duty to respect in him their\r\nconfidence, and to treat him as if he deserved it: and if his punishment\r\ncan be commuted now for an useful amendment of the constitution, I shall\r\nrejoice in it. My sheet being full, I perceive it is high time to\r\noffer you my friendly salutations, and assure you of my constant and\r\naffectionate esteem and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLIV.--TO GEORGE HAY, June 2, 1807\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE HAY.\r\n\r\nWashington, June 2, 1807.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nWhile Burr’s case is depending before the court, I will trouble you from\r\ntime to time with what occurs to me. I observe that the case of Marbury\r\nv. Madison has been cited, and I think it material to stop at the\r\nthreshold the citing that case as authority, and to have it denied to be\r\nlaw. 1. Because the judges, in the outset, disclaimed all cognizance of\r\nthe case; although they then went on to say what would have been their\r\nopinion, had they had cognizance of it. This then was confessedly an\r\nextra-judicial opinion, and, as such, of no authority. 2. Because, had\r\nit been judicially pronounced, it would have been against law; for to\r\na commission, a deed, a bond, delivery is essential to give validity.\r\nUntil, therefore, the commission is delivered out of the hands of the\r\nexecutive and his agents, it is not his deed. He may withhold or cancel\r\nit at pleasure, as he might his private deed in the same situation. The\r\nconstitution intended that the three great branches of the government\r\nshould be co-ordinate, and independent of each other. As to acts,\r\ntherefore, which are to be done by either, it has given no control to\r\nanother branch. A judge, I presume, cannot sit on a bench without a\r\ncommission, or a record of a commission: and the constitution having\r\ngiven to the judiciary branch no means of compelling the executive\r\neither to deliver a commission, or to make a record of it, shows it did\r\nnot intend to give the judiciary that control over the executive, but\r\nthat it should remain in the power of the latter to do it or not. Where\r\ndifferent branches have to act in their respective lines, finally\r\nand without appeal, under any law, they may give to it different and\r\nopposite constructions. Thus in the case of William Smith, the House of\r\nRepresentatives determined he was a citizen, and in the case of William\r\nDuane (precisely the same in every material circumstance) the judges\r\ndetermined he was no citizen. In the cases of Callender and others, the\r\njudges determined the sedition act was valid under the constitution,\r\nand exercised their regular powers of sentencing them to fine and\r\nimprisonment. But the executive determined that the sedition act was\r\na nullity under the constitution, and exercised his regular power of\r\nprohibiting the execution of the sentence, or rather of executing\r\nthe real law, which protected the acts of the defendants. From these\r\ndifferent constructions of the same act by different branches, less\r\nmischief arises, than from giving to any one of them a control over the\r\nothers. The executive and Senate act on the construction, that until\r\ndelivery from the executive department, a commission is in their\r\npossession, and within their rightful power; and in cases of commissions\r\nnot revocable at will, where, after the Senate’s approbation and the\r\nPresident’s signing and sealing, new information of the unfitness of\r\nthe person has come to hand before the delivery of the commission,\r\nnew nominations have been made and approved, and new commissions have\r\nissued.\r\n\r\nOn this construction I have hitherto acted; on this I shall ever act,\r\nand maintain it with the powers of the government, against any control\r\nwhich may be attempted by the judges in subversion of the independence\r\nof the executive and Senate within their peculiar department. I presume,\r\ntherefore, that in a case where our decision is by the constitution\r\nthe supreme one, and that which can be carried into effect, it is the\r\nconstitutionally authoritative one, and that that by the judges was\r\n_coram non judice_, and unauthoritative, because it cannot be carried\r\ninto effect. I have long wished for a proper occasion to have the\r\ngratuitous opinion in Marbury v. Madison brought before the public, and\r\ndenounced as not law: and I think the present a fortunate one, because\r\nit occupies such a place in the public attention. I should be glad,\r\ntherefore, if, in noticing that case, you could take occasion to express\r\nthe determination of the executive, that the doctrines of that case were\r\ngiven extra-judicially and against law, and that their reverse will be\r\nthe rule of action with the executive. If this opinion should not\r\nbe your own, I would wish it to be expressed merely as that of the\r\nexecutive. If it is your own also, you would of course give to the\r\narguments such a developement, as a case, incidental only, might render\r\nproper.\r\n\r\nI salute you with friendship and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLV.--TO ALBERT GALLATIN, June 3, 1807\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON TO ALBERT GALLATIN.\r\n\r\nI gave you, some time ago, a project of a more equal tariff on wines,\r\nthan that which now exists. But in that I yielded considerably to the\r\nfaulty classification of them in our law. I have now formed one with\r\nattention, and according to the best information I possess, classing\r\nthem more rigorously. I am persuaded, that were the duty on cheap wines\r\nput on the same ratio with the dear, it would wonderfully enlarge\r\nthe field of those who use wine, to the expulsion of whiskey. The\r\nintroduction of a very cheap wine (St. George) into my neighborhood,\r\nwithin two years past, has quadrupled in that time the number of those\r\nwho keep wine, and will ere long increase them tenfold. This would be a\r\ngreat gain to the treasury, and to the sobriety of our country. I will\r\nhere add my tariff, wherein you will be able to choose any rate of duty\r\nyou please; and to decide whether it will not, on a fit occasion, be\r\nproper for legislative attention. Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: page77]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLVI.--TO GEORGE HAY, June 5, 1807\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE HAY.\r\n\r\nWashington, June 5, 1807.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of the 31st instant has been received, and I think it will be\r\nfortunate if any circumstance should produce a discharge of the present\r\nscanty grand jury, and a future summons of a fuller: though the same\r\nviews of protecting the offender may again reduce the number to sixteen,\r\nin order to lessen the chance of getting twelve to concur. It is\r\nunderstood, that wherever Burr met with subjects who did not choose to\r\nembark in his projects, unless approved by their government, he asserted\r\nthat he had that approbation. Most of them took his word for it, but\r\nit is said that with those who would not, the following stratagem was\r\npractised. A forged letter, purporting to be from General Dearborn,\r\nwas made to express his approbation, and to say that I was absent\r\nat Monticello, but that there was no doubt that, on my return, my\r\napprobation of his enterprises would be given. This letter was spread\r\nopen on his table, so as to invite the eye of whoever entered his room;\r\nand he contrived occasions of sending up into his room, those whom he\r\nwished to become witnesses of his acting under sanction. By this means,\r\nhe avoided committing himself to any liability to prosecution for\r\nforgery, and gave another proof of being a great man in little things,\r\nwhile he is really small in great ones. I must add General Dearborn’s\r\ndeclaration, that he never wrote a letter to Burr in his life, except\r\nthat when here, once in a winter, he usually wrote him a billet of\r\ninvitation to dine. The only object of sending you the enclosed letters\r\nis to possess you of the fact, that you may know how to pursue it,\r\nif any of your witnesses should know any thing of it. My intention in\r\nwriting to you several times, has been to convey facts or observations\r\noccurring in the absence of the Attorney General, and not to make to\r\nthe dreadful drudgery you are going through the unnecessary addition of\r\nwriting me letters in answer, which I beg you to relieve yourself from,\r\nexcept when some necessity calls for it.\r\n\r\nI salute you with friendship and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLVII.--TO DOCTOR HORATIO TURPIN, June 10, 1807\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR HORATIO TURPIN.\r\n\r\nWashington, June 10, 1807.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of June the 1st has been duly received. To a mind like yours,\r\ncapable in any question of abstracting it from its relation to yourself,\r\nI may safely hazard explanations, which I have generally avoided to\r\nothers, on questions of appointment. Bringing into office no desires of\r\nmaking it subservient to the advancement of my own private interests, it\r\nhas been no sacrifice, by postponing them, to strengthen the confidence\r\nof my fellow-citizens. But I have not felt equal indifference towards\r\nexcluding merit from office, merely because it was related to me.\r\nHowever, I have thought it my duty so to do, that my constituents may\r\nbe satisfied, that, in selecting persons for the management of their\r\naffairs, I am influenced by neither personal nor family interests, and\r\nespecially, that the field of public office will not be perverted by\r\nme into a family property. On this subject, I had the benefit of useful\r\nlessons from my predecessors, had I needed them, marking what was to be\r\nimitated and what avoided. But, in truth, the nature of our government\r\nis lesson enough. Its energy depending mainly on the confidence of the\r\npeople, in their Chief Magistrate, makes it his duty to spare nothing\r\nwhich can strengthen him with that confidence.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of my constant friendship and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLVIII.--TO JOHN NORVELL, June 11, 1807\r\n\r\nTO JOHN NORVELL.\r\n\r\nWashington, June 11, 1807.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nYour letter of May the 9th has been duly received. The subjects it\r\nproposes would require time and space for even moderate developement. My\r\noccupations limit me to a very short notice of them. I think there does\r\nnot exist a good elementary work on the organization of society\r\ninto civil government: I mean a work which presents in one full\r\nand comprehensive view the system of principles on which such an\r\norganization should be founded, according to the rights of nature. For\r\nwant of a single work of that character, I should recommend Locke\r\non Government, Sidney, Priestley’s Essay on the First Principles of\r\nGovernment, Chipman’s Principles of Government, and the Federalist.\r\nAdding, perhaps, Beccaria on Crimes and Punishments, because of the\r\ndemonstrative manner in which he has treated that branch of the subject.\r\nIf your views of political inquiry go further, to the subjects of money\r\nand commerce, Smith’s Wealth of Nations is the best book to be read,\r\nunless Say’s Political Economy can be had, which treats the same\r\nsubjects on the same principles, but in a shorter compass, and more\r\nlucid manner. But I believe this work has not been translated into our\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nHistory, in general, only informs us what bad government is. But as we\r\nhave employed some of the best materials of the British constitution in\r\nthe construction of our own government, a knowledge of British history\r\nbecomes useful to the American politician. There is, however, no general\r\nhistory of that country which can be recommended. The elegant one of\r\nHume seems intended to disguise and discredit the good principles of the\r\ngovernment, and is so plausible and pleasing in its style and manner,\r\nas to instil its errors and heresies insensibly into the minds of unwary\r\nreaders. Baxter has performed a good operation on it. He has taken the\r\ntext of Hume as his ground-work, abridging it by the omission of some\r\ndetails of little interest, and wherever he has found him endeavoring to\r\nmislead, by either the suppression of a truth, or by giving it a false\r\ncoloring, he has changed the text to what it should be, so that we\r\nmay properly call it Hume’s history republicanized. He has, moreover,\r\ncontinued the history (but indifferently) from where Hume left it,\r\nto the year 1800. The work is not popular in England, because it is\r\nrepublican; and but a few copies have ever reached America. It is a\r\nsingle quarto volume. Adding to this Ludlow’s Memoirs, Mrs. Macaulay’s\r\nand Belknap’s histories, a sufficient view will be presented of the free\r\nprinciples of the English constitution.\r\n\r\nTo your request of my opinion of the manner in which a newspaper should\r\nbe conducted, so as to be most useful, I should answer, ‘by restraining\r\nit to true, facts and sound principles only.’ Yet I fear such a paper\r\nwould find few subscribers. It is a melancholy truth, that a suppression\r\nof the press could not more completely deprive the nation of its\r\nbenefits, than is done by its abandoned prostitution to falsehood.\r\nNothing can now be believed which is seen in a newspaper. Truth itself\r\nbecomes suspicious by being put into that polluted vehicle. The real\r\nextent of this state of misinformation is known only to those who are in\r\nsituations to confront facts within their knowledge with the lies of\r\nthe day. I really look with commiseration over the great body of my\r\nfellow-citizens, who, reading newspapers, live and die in the belief,\r\nthat they have known something of what has been passing in the world in\r\ntheir time; whereas the accounts they have read in newspapers are just\r\nas true a history of any other period of the world as of the present,\r\nexcept that the real names of the day are affixed to their fables.\r\nGeneral facts may indeed be collected from them, such as that Europe is\r\nnow at war, that Bonaparte has been a successful warrior, that he has\r\nsubjected a great portion of Europe to his will, &c. &c.; but no details\r\ncan be relied on. I will add, that the man who never looks into a\r\nnewspaper is better informed than he who reads them; inasmuch as he\r\nwho knows nothing is nearer to truth than he whose mind is filled with\r\nfalsehoods and errors. He who reads nothing will still learn the great\r\nfacts, and the details are all false.\r\n\r\nPerhaps an editor might begin a reformation in some such way as this.\r\nDivide his paper into four chapters, heading the 1st, Truths. 2nd,\r\nProbabilities. 3rd, Possibilities. 4th, Lies. The 1st chapter would be\r\nvery short, as it would contain little more than authentic papers, and\r\ninformation from such sources, as the editor would be willing to risk\r\nhis own reputation for their truth. The 2nd would contain what, from a\r\nmature consideration of all circumstances, his judgment should conclude\r\nto be probably true. This, however, should rather contain too little\r\nthan too much. The 3rd and 4th should be professedly for those readers\r\nwho would rather have lies for their money than the blank paper they\r\nwould occupy.\r\n\r\nSuch an editor too, would have to set his face against the demoralizing\r\npractice of feeding the public mind habitually on slander, and the\r\ndepravity of taste which this nauseous aliment induces. Defamation\r\nis becoming a necessary of life; insomuch, that a dish of tea in the\r\nmorning or evening cannot be digested without this stimulant. Even those\r\nwho do not believe these abominations, still read them with complaisance\r\nto their auditors, and instead of the abhorrence and indignation which\r\nshould fill a virtuous mind, betray a secret pleasure in the possibility\r\nthat some may believe them, though they do not themselves. It seems to\r\nescape them, that it is not he who prints, but he who pays for printing\r\na slander, who is its real author.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts on the subjects of your letter are hazarded at your\r\nrequest. Repeated instances of the publication of what has not been\r\nintended for the public eye, and the malignity with which political\r\nenemies torture every sentence from me into meanings imagined by their\r\nown wickedness only, justify my expressing a solicitude, that this hasty\r\ncommunication may in nowise be permitted to find its way into the public\r\npapers. Not fearing these political bull-dogs, I yet avoided putting\r\nmyself in the way of being baited by them, and do not wish to volunteer\r\naway that portion of tranquillity, which a firm execution of my duties\r\nwill permit me to enjoy.\r\n\r\nI tender you my salutations, and best wishes for your success.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLIX.--TO WILLIAM SHORT, June 12, 1807\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\nWashington, June 12, 1807.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\n******\r\n\r\nThe proposition in your letter of May the 16th, of adding an umpire to\r\nour discordant negotiators at Paris, struck me favorably on reading it,\r\nand reflection afterwards strengthened my first impressions. I made it\r\ntherefore a subject of consultation with my coadjutors, as is our usage.\r\nFor our government, although in theory subject to be directed by the\r\nunadvised will of the President, is, and from its origin has been, a\r\nvery different thing in practice. The minor business in each department\r\nis done by the Head of the department, on consultation with the\r\nPresident alone. But all matters of importance or difficulty are\r\nsubmitted to all the Heads of departments composing the cabinet;\r\nsometimes by the President’s consulting them separately and\r\nsuccessively, as they happen to call on him; but in the greatest cases,\r\nby calling them together, discussing the subject maturely, and finally\r\ntaking the vote, in which the President counts himself but as one. So\r\nthat in all important cases the executive is, in fact, a directory,\r\nwhich certainly the President might control: but of this there was never\r\nan example either in the first or the present administration. I have\r\nheard, indeed, that my predecessor sometimes decided things against his\r\ncouncil.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nI adopted in the present case the mode of separate consultation. The\r\nopinion of each member, taken separately, was, that the addition of\r\na third negotiator was not at this time advisable. For the present,\r\ntherefore, the question must rest. Mr. Bowdoin, we know, is anxious to\r\ncome home, and is detained only by the delicacy of not deserting his\r\npost. In the existing temper between him and his colleague, it would\r\ncertainly be better that one of them should make an opening for\r\nre-composing the commission more harmoniously. I salute you with\r\naffection and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER L.--TO GEORGE HAY, June 12, 1807\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE HAY.\r\n\r\nWashington, June 12, 1807.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 9th is this moment received. Reserving the necessary\r\nright of the President of the United States to decide, independently of\r\nall other authority, what papers, coming to him as President, the public\r\ninterests permit to be communicated, and to whom, I assure you of\r\nmy readiness, under that restriction, voluntarily to furnish, on all\r\noccasions, whatever the purposes of justice may require. But the letter\r\nof General Wilkinson, of October the 21st, requested for the defence\r\nof Colonel Burr, with every other paper relating to the charges against\r\nhim, which were in my possession when the Attorney General went on to\r\nRichmond in March, I then delivered to him; and I have always taken for\r\ngranted he left the whole with you. If he did, and the bundle retains\r\nthe order in which I had arranged it, you will readily find the letter\r\ndesired, under the date of its receipt, which was November the 25th: but\r\nlest the Attorney General should not have left those papers with you,\r\nI this day write to him to forward this one by post. An uncertainty\r\nwhether he is at Philadelphia, Wilmington, or New Castle, may produce\r\ndelay in his receiving my letter, of which it is proper you should be\r\napprized. But, as I do not recollect the whole contents of that letter,\r\nI must beg leave to devolve on you the exercise of that discretion\r\nwhich it would be my right and duty to exercise, by withholding the\r\ncommunication of any parts of the letter, which are not directly\r\nmaterial for the purposes of justice.\r\n\r\nWith this application, which is specific, a prompt compliance is\r\npracticable. But when the request goes to ‘copies of the orders issued\r\nin relation to Colonel Burr, to the officers at Orleans, Natchez, &c.\r\nby the Secretaries of the War and Navy departments,’ it seems to cover\r\na correspondence of many months, with such a variety of officers, civil\r\nand military, all over the United States, as would amount to the laying\r\nopen the whole executive books. I have desired the Secretary of War to\r\nexamine his official communications; and on a view of these, we may be\r\nable to judge what can and ought to be done towards a compliance with\r\nthe request. If the defendant alleges that there was any particular\r\norder, which, as a cause, produced any particular act on his part, then\r\nhe must know what this order was, can specify it, and a prompt answer\r\ncan be given. If the object had been specified, we might then have had\r\nsome guide for our conjectures, as to what part of the executive records\r\nmight be useful to him: but, with a perfect willingness to do what is\r\nright, we are without the indications which may enable us to do it. If\r\nthe researches of the Secretary at War should produce any thing proper\r\nfor communication, and pertinent to any point we can conceive in the\r\ndefence before the court, it shall be forwarded to you. I salute you\r\nwith respect and esteem.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LI.--TO GEORGE HAY, June 17, 1807\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE HAY.\r\n\r\nWashington, June 17, 1807.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nIn answering your letter of the 9th, which desired a communication of\r\none to me from General Wilkinson, specified by its date, I informed\r\nyou in mine of the 12th that I had delivered it, with all other papers\r\nrespecting the charges against Aaron Burr, to the Attorney General,\r\nwhen he went to Richmond; that I had supposed he had left them in\r\nyour possession, but would immediately write to him, if he had not, to\r\nforward that particular letter without delay. I wrote to him accordingly\r\non the same day, but having no answer, I know not whether he has\r\nforwarded the letter. I stated in the same letter, that I had desired\r\nthe Secretary at War, to examine his office, in order to comply with\r\nyour further request, to furnish copies of the orders which had been\r\ngiven respecting Aaron Burr and his property; and in a subsequent letter\r\nof the same day, I forwarded to you copies of two letters from the\r\nSecretary at War, which appeared to be within the description expressed\r\nin your letter. The order from the Secretary of the Navy, you said, you\r\nwere in possession of. The receipt of these papers had, I presume, so\r\nfar anticipated, and others this day forwarded will have substantially\r\nfulfilled, the object of a subpoena from the District Court of Richmond,\r\nrequiring that those officers and myself should attend the Court in\r\nRichmond, with the letter of General Wilkinson, the answer to that\r\nletter, and the orders of the departments of War and the Navy, therein\r\ngenerally described. No answer to General Wilkinson’s letter, other\r\nthan a mere acknowledgment of its receipt, in a letter written for a\r\ndifferent purpose, was ever written by myself or any other. To these\r\ncommunications of papers, I will add, that if the defendant supposes\r\nthere are any facts within the knowledge of the Heads of departments, or\r\nof myself, which can be useful for his defence, from a desire of doing\r\nany thing our situation will permit in furtherance of justice, we shall\r\nbe ready to give him the benefit of it, by way of deposition, through\r\nany persons whom the Court shall authorize to take our testimony at\r\nthis place. I know, indeed, that this cannot be done but by consent of\r\nparties; and I therefore authorize you to give consent on the part of\r\nthe United States. Mr. Burr’s consent will be given of course, if he\r\nsupposes the testimony useful.\r\n\r\nAs to our personal attendance at Richmond, I am persuaded the Court\r\nis sensible, that paramount duties to the nation at large control the\r\nobligation of compliance with their summons in this case; as they would,\r\nshould we receive a similar one, to attend the trials of Blannerhassett\r\nand others, in the Mississippi territory, those instituted at St. Louis\r\nand other places on the western waters, or at any place, other than the\r\nseat of government. To comply with such calls would leave the nation\r\nwithout an executive branch, whose agency, nevertheless, is understood\r\nto be so constantly necessary, that it is the sole branch which the\r\nconstitution requires to be always in function. It could not then\r\nmean that it should be withdrawn from its station by any co-ordinate\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nWith respect to papers, there is certainly a public and a private\r\nside to our offices. To the former belong grants of land, patents for\r\ninventions, certain commissions, proclamations, and other papers patent\r\nin their nature. To the other belong mere executive proceedings. All\r\nnations have found it necessary, that for the advantageous conduct of\r\ntheir affairs, some of these proceedings, at least, should remain known\r\nto their executive functionary only. He, of course, from the nature of\r\nthe case, must be the sole judge of which of them the public interests\r\nwill permit publication. Hence, under our constitution, in requests of\r\npapers, from the legislative to the executive branch, an exception is\r\ncarefully expressed, as to those which he may deem the public welfare\r\nmay require not to be disclosed; as you will see in the enclosed\r\nresolution of the House of Representatives, which produced the message\r\nof January 22nd, respecting this case. The respect mutually due between\r\nthe constituted authorities, in their official intercourse, as well\r\nas sincere dispositions to do for every one what is just, will always\r\ninsure from the executive, in exercising the duty of discrimination\r\nconfided to him, the same candor and integrity to which the nation has\r\nin like manner trusted in the disposal of its judiciary authorities.\r\nConsidering you as the organ for communicating these sentiments to\r\nthe Court, I address them to you for that purpose, and salute you with\r\nesteem and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LII.--TO GEORGE HAY, June 19,1807\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE HAY.\r\n\r\nWashington, June 19,1807.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYours of the 17th was received last night. Three blank pardons had been\r\n(as I expect) made up and forwarded by the mail of yesterday, and I have\r\ndesired three others to go by that of this evening. You ask what is to\r\nbe done if Bollman finally rejects his pardon, and the Judge decides\r\nit to have no effect? Move to commit him immediately for treason or\r\nmisdemeanor, as you think the evidence will support; let the court\r\ndecide where he shall be sent for trial; and on application, I will have\r\nthe marshal aided in his transportation, with the executive means. And\r\nwe think it proper, further, that when Burr shall have been convicted of\r\neither treason or misdemeanor, you should immediately have committed all\r\nthose persons against whom you should find evidence sufficient, whose\r\nagency has been so prominent as to mark them as proper objects of\r\npunishment, and especially where their boldness has betrayed an\r\ninveteracy of criminal disposition. As to obscure offenders and\r\nrepenting ones, let them lie for consideration.\r\n\r\nI enclose you the copy of a letter received last night, and giving\r\nsingular information. I have inquired into the character of Graybell. He\r\nwas an old revolutionary captain, is now a flour merchant in Baltimore,\r\nof the most respectable character, and whose word would be taken as\r\nimplicitly as any man’s for whatever he affirms. The letter-writer,\r\nalso, is a man of entire respectability. I am well informed, that for\r\nmore than a twelvemonth it has been believed in Baltimore, generally,\r\nthat Burr was engaged in some criminal enterprise, and that Luther\r\nMartin knew all about it. We think you should immediately despatch a\r\nsubpoena for Graybell; and while that is on the road, you will have time\r\nto consider in what form you will use his testimony; e.g. shall Luther\r\nMartin be summoned as a witness against Burr, and Graybell held ready\r\nto confront him? It may be doubted whether we could examine a witness\r\nto discredit our own witness. Besides, the lawyers say that they are\r\nprivileged from being forced to breaches of confidence, and that\r\nno others are. Shall we move to commit Luther Martin, as _particeps\r\ncriminis_ with Burr? Graybell will fix upon him misprision of treason at\r\nleast. And at any rate, his evidence will put down this unprincipled and\r\nimpudent federal bull-dog, and add another proof that the most clamorous\r\ndefenders of Burr are all his accomplices. It will explain why Luther\r\nMartin flew so hastily to the aid of ‘his honorable friend,’ abandoning\r\nhis clients and their property during a session of a principal court\r\nin Maryland, now filled, as I am told, with the clamors and ruin of his\r\nclients. I believe we shall send on Latrobe as a witness. He will prove\r\nthat Aaron Burr endeavored to get him to engage several thousand men,\r\nchiefly Irish emigrants, whom he had been in the habit of employing in\r\nthe works he directs, under pretence of a canal opposite Louisville,\r\nor of the Washita, in which, had he succeeded, he could with that force\r\nalone have carried every thing before him, and would not have been where\r\nhe now is. He knows, too, of certain meetings of Burr, Bollman, Yrujo,\r\nand one other whom we have never named yet, but have him not the less in\r\nour view.\r\n\r\nI salute you with friendship and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\nP. S. Will you send us half a dozen blank subpoenas?\r\n\r\nSince writing the within I have had a conversation with Latrobe. He says\r\nit was five hundred men he was desired to engage. The pretexts were to\r\nwork on the Ohio canal, and be paid in Washita lands. Your witnesses\r\nwill some of them prove that Burr had no interest in the Ohio canal, and\r\nthat consequently this was a mere pretext to cover the real object from\r\nthe men themselves, and all others. Latrobe will set out in the stage of\r\nto-morrow evening, and be with you Monday evening. T. J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LIII.--TO GOVERNOR SULLIVAN, June 19, 1807\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR SULLIVAN.\r\n\r\nWashington, June 19, 1807.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nIn acknowledging the receipt of your favor of the 3rd instant, I avail\r\nmyself of the occasion it offers of tendering to yourself, to Mr.\r\nLincoln, and to your State, my sincere congratulations on the late happy\r\nevent of the election of a republican executive to preside over its\r\ncouncils. The harmony it has introduced between the legislative and\r\nexecutive branches, between the people and both of them, and between\r\nall and the General Government, are so many steps towards securing that\r\nunion of action and effort in all its parts, without which no nation can\r\nbe happy or safe. The just respect, with which all the States have ever\r\nlooked to Massachusetts, could leave none of them without anxiety while\r\nshe was in a state of alienation from her family and friends. Your\r\nopinion of the propriety and advantage of a more intimate correspondence\r\nbetween the executives of the several States, and that of the Union, as\r\na central point, is precisely that which I have ever entertained; and\r\non coming into office I felt the advantages which would result from that\r\nharmony. I had it even in contemplation, after the annual recommendation\r\nto Congress of those measures called for by the times, which the\r\nconstitution had placed under their power, to make communications in\r\nlike manner to the executives of the States, as to any parts of them\r\nto which their legislatures might be alone competent. For many are the\r\nexercises of power reserved to the States, wherein an uniformity of\r\nproceeding would be advantageous to all. Such are quarantines, health\r\nlaws, regulations of the press, banking institutions, training militia,\r\n&c. &c. But you know what was the state of the several governments when\r\nI came into office. That a great proportion of them were federal, and\r\nwould have been delighted with such opportunities of proclaiming their\r\ncontempt, and of opposing republican men and measures. Opportunities so\r\nfurnished and used by some of the State governments, would have produced\r\nan ill effect, and would have insured the failure of the object of\r\nuniform proceeding. If it could be ventured even now (Connecticut and\r\nDelaware being still hostile) it must be on some greater occasion than\r\nis likely to arise within my time. I look to it, therefore, as a course\r\nwhich will probably be to be left to the consideration of my successor.\r\n\r\nI consider, with you, the federalists as completely vanquished, and\r\nnever more to take the field under their own banners. They will now\r\nreserve themselves to profit by the schisms among republicans, and to\r\nearn favors from minorities, whom they will enable to triumph over\r\ntheir more numerous antagonists. So long as republican minorities barely\r\naccept their votes, no great harm will be done; because it will only\r\nplace in power one shade of republicanism, instead of another. But\r\nwhen they purchase the votes of the federalists, by giving them\r\na participation of office, trust, and power, it is a proof that\r\nanti-monarchism is not their strongest passion. I do not think that the\r\nrepublican minority in Pennsylvania has fallen into this heresy, nor\r\nthat there are in your State materials of which a minority can be made\r\nwho will fall into it.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the tour my friends to the north have proposed that I\r\nshould make in that quarter, I have not made up a final opinion. The\r\ncourse of life which General Washington had run, civil and military,\r\nthe services he had rendered, and the space he therefore occupied in the\r\naffections of his fellow-citizens, take from his examples the weight of\r\nprecedents for others, because no others can arrogate to themselves the\r\nclaims which he had on the public homage. To myself, therefore, it comes\r\nas a new question, to be viewed under all the phases it may present.\r\nI confess, that I am not reconciled to the idea of a chief magistrate\r\nparading himself through the several States as an object of public gaze,\r\nand in quest of an applause, which, to be valuable, should be purely\r\nvoluntary. I had rather acquire silent good will by a faithful discharge\r\nof my duties, than owe expressions of it to my putting myself in the way\r\nof receiving them. Were I to make such a tour to Portsmouth or Portland,\r\nI must do it to Savannah, perhaps to Orleans and Frankfort. As I have\r\nnever yet seen the time when the public business would have permitted me\r\nto be so long in a situation in which I could not carry it on, so I have\r\nno reason to expect that such a time will come while I remain in office.\r\nA journey to Boston or Portsmouth, after I shall be a private citizen,\r\nwould much better harmonize with my feelings, as well as duties; and,\r\nfounded in curiosity, would give no claims to an extension of it. I\r\nshould see my friends, too, more at our mutual ease, and be left more\r\nexclusively to their society. However, I end as I began, by declaring\r\nI have made up no opinion on the subject, and that I reserve it as a\r\nquestion for future consideration and advice.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, and at all times, I salute you with great respect and\r\nesteem,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LIV.--TO GEORGE HAY, June 20, 1807\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE HAY.\r\n\r\nWashington, June 20, 1807.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMr. Latrobe now comes on as a witness against Burr. His presence here\r\nis with great inconvenience dispensed with, as one hundred and fifty\r\nworkmen require his constant directions on various public works of\r\npressing importance. I hope you will permit him to come away as soon as\r\npossible. How far his testimony will be important as to the prisoner, I\r\nknow not; but I am desirous that those meetings of Yrujo with Burr and\r\nhis principal accomplices should come fully out, and judicially, as they\r\nwill establish the just complaints we have against his nation.\r\n\r\nI did not see till last night the opinion of the Judge on the _subpoena\r\nduces tecum_ against the President. Considering the question there as\r\n_coram non judice_, I did not read his argument with much attention.\r\nYet I saw readily enough, that, as is usual, where an opinion is to be\r\nsupported, right or wrong, he dwells much on smaller objections, and\r\npasses over those which are solid. Laying down the position generally,\r\nthat all persons owe obedience to subpoenas, he admits no exception\r\nunless it can be produced in his law books. But if the constitution\r\nenjoins on a particular officer to be always engaged in a particular\r\nset of duties imposed on him, does not this supersede the general law,\r\nsubjecting him to minor duties inconsistent with these? The constitution\r\nenjoins his constant agency in the concerns of six millions of people.\r\nIs the law paramount to this, which calls on him on behalf of a single\r\none? Let us apply the Judge’s own doctrine to the case of himself and\r\nhis brethren. The sheriff of Henrico summons him from the bench, to\r\nquell a riot somewhere in his county. The federal judge is, by the\r\ngeneral law, a part of the posse of the State sheriff. Would the Judge\r\nabandon major duties to perform lesser ones? Again; the court of Orleans\r\nor Maine commands, by subpoenas, the attendance of all the judges of\r\nthe Supreme Court. Would they abandon their posts as judges, and the\r\ninterests of millions committed to them, to serve the purposes of a\r\nsingle individual? The leading principle of our constitution is the\r\nindependence of the legislature, executive, and judiciary, of each\r\nother, and none are more jealous of this than the judiciary. But would\r\nthe executive be independent of the judiciary, if he were subject to\r\nthe commands of the latter, and to imprisonment for disobedience; if the\r\nseveral courts could bandy him from pillar to post, keep him constantly\r\ntrudging from north to south, and east to west, and withdraw him\r\nentirely from his constitutional duties? The intention of the\r\nconstitution, that each branch should be independent of the others, is\r\nfurther manifested by the means it has furnished to each, to protect\r\nitself from enterprises of force attempted on them by the others, and\r\nto none has it given more effectual or diversified means than to the\r\nexecutive. Again; because ministers can go into a court in London,\r\nas witnesses, without interruption to their executive duties, it is\r\ninferred that they would go to a court one thousand or one thousand five\r\nhundred miles off, and that ours are to be dragged from Maine to Orleans\r\nby every criminal who will swear that their testimony ‘may be of use to\r\nhim.’ The Judge says, ‘it is apparent that the President’s duties,\r\nas chief magistrate, do not demand his whole time, and are not\r\nunremitting.’ If he alludes to our annual retirement from the seat\r\nof government, during the sickly season, he should be told that such\r\narrangements are made for carrying on the public business, at and\r\nbetween the several stations we take, that it goes on as unremittingly\r\nthere, as if we were at the seat of government. I pass more hours in\r\npublic business at Monticello than I do here, every day; and it is much\r\nmore laborious, because all must be done in writing. Our stations being\r\nknown, all communications come to them regularly, as to fixed points.\r\nIt would be very different were we always on the road, or placed in the\r\nnoisy and crowded taverns where courts are held. Mr. Rodney is expected\r\nhere every hour, having been kept away by a sick child. I salute you\r\nwith friendship and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LV.--TO DOCTOR WISTAR, June 21, 1807\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR WISTAR.\r\n\r\nWashington, June 21, 1807.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have a grandson, the son of Mr. Randolph, now about fifteen years of\r\nage, in whose education I take a lively interest.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nI am not a friend to placing young men in populous cities, because they\r\nacquire there habits and partialities which do not contribute to the\r\nhappiness of their after life. But there are particular branches of\r\nscience, which are not so advantageously taught any where else in\r\nthe United States as in Philadelphia. The garden at the Woodlands for\r\nBotany, Mr. Peale’s Museum for Natural History, your Medical School for\r\nAnatomy, and the able professors in all of them, give advantages not to\r\nbe found elsewhere. We propose, therefore, to send him to Philadelphia\r\nto attend the schools of Botany, Natural History, Anatomy, and perhaps\r\nSurgery; but not of Medicine. And why not of Medicine, you will ask?\r\nBeing led to the subject, I will avail myself of the occasion to express\r\nmy opinions on that science, and the extent of my medical creed. But, to\r\nfinish first with respect to my grandson, I will state the favor I ask\r\nof you, and which is the object of this letter.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nThis subject dismissed, I may now take up that which it led to, and\r\nfurther tax your patience with unlearned views of medicine; which, as in\r\nmost cases, are, perhaps, the more confident in proportion as they are\r\nless enlightened.\r\n\r\nWe know, from what we see and feel, that the animal body is in its\r\norgans and functions subject to derangement, inducing pain, and\r\ntending to its destruction. In this disordered state, we observe nature\r\nproviding for the re-establishment of order, by exciting some salutary\r\nevacuation of the morbific matter, or by some other operation which\r\nescapes our imperfect senses and researches. She brings on a crisis, by\r\nstools, vomiting, sweat, urine, expectoration, bleeding, &c, which, for\r\nthe most part, ends in the restoration of healthy action. Experience has\r\ntaught us also, that there are certain substances, by which, applied to\r\nthe living body, internally or externally, we can at will produce these\r\nsame evacuations, and thus do, in a short time, what nature would do but\r\nslowly, and do effectually, what perhaps she would not have strength\r\nto accomplish. Where, then, we have seen a disease, characterized\r\nby specific signs or phenomena, and relieved by a certain natural\r\nevacuation or process, whenever that disease recurs under the same\r\nappearances, we may reasonably count on producing a solution of it, by\r\nthe use of such substances as we have found produce the same evacuation\r\nor movement. Thus, fulness of the stomach we can relieve by emetics;\r\ndiseases of the bowels, by purgatives; inflammatory cases, by bleeding;\r\nintermittents, by the Peruvian bark; syphilis, by mercury; watchfulness,\r\nby opium; &c. So far, I bow to the utility of medicine. It goes to the\r\nwell defined forms of disease, and happily, to those the most frequent.\r\nBut the disorders of the animal body, and the symptoms indicating\r\nthem, are as various as the elements of which the body is composed. The\r\ncombinations, too, of these symptoms are so infinitely diversified,\r\nthat many associations of them appear too rarely to establish a definite\r\ndisease: and to an unknown disease, there cannot be a known remedy.\r\nHere, then, the judicious, the moral, the humane physician should stop.\r\nHaving been so often a witness to the salutary efforts which nature\r\nmakes to re-establish the disordered functions, he should rather trust\r\nto their action, than hazard the interruption of that, and a greater\r\nderangement of the system, by conjectural experiments on a machine so\r\ncomplicated and so unknown as the human body, and a subject so sacred\r\nas human life. Or, if the appearance of doing something be necessary to\r\nkeep alive the hope and spirits of the patient, it should be of the most\r\ninnocent character. One of the most successful physicians I have ever\r\nknown, has assured me, that he used more bread pills, drops of colored\r\nwater, and powders of hickory ashes, than of all other medicines put\r\ntogether. It was certainly a pious fraud. But the adventurous physician\r\ngoes on, and substitutes presumption for knowledge. From the scanty\r\nfield of what is known, he launches into the boundless region of what\r\nis unknown. He establishes for his guide some fanciful theory of\r\ncorpuscular attraction, of chemical agency, of mechanical powers, of\r\nstimuli, of irritability accumulated or exhausted, of depletion by the\r\nlancet, and repletion by mercury, or some other ingenious dream, which\r\nlets him into all nature’s secrets at short hand. On the principle which\r\nhe thus assumes, he forms his table of nosology, arrays his diseases\r\ninto families, and extends his curative treatment, by analogy, to all\r\nthe cases he has thus arbitrarily marshaled together. I have lived\r\nmyself to see the disciples of Hoffman, Boerhaave, Stahl, Cullen, Brown,\r\nsucceed one another like the shifting figures of a magic-lanthern, and\r\ntheir fancies like the dresses of the annual doll-babies from Paris,\r\nbecoming, from their novelty, the vogue of the day, and yielding to\r\nthe next novelty their ephemeral favor. The patient, treated on the\r\nfashionable theory, sometimes gets well in spite of the medicine. The\r\nmedicine therefore restored him, and the young doctor receives new\r\ncourage to proceed in his bold experiments on the lives of his fellow\r\ncreatures. I believe we may safely affirm, that the inexperienced and\r\npresumptuous band of medical tyros let loose upon the world, destroys\r\nmore of human life in one year, than all the Robin-hoods, Cartouches,\r\nand Macheaths do in a century. It is in this part of medicine that I\r\nwish to see a reform, an abandonment of hypothesis for sober facts, the\r\nfirst degree of value set on clinical observation, and the lowest on\r\nvisionary theories. I would wish the young practitioner, especially, to\r\nhave deeply impressed on his mind the real limits of his art, and that\r\nwhen the state of his patient gets beyond these, his office is to be a\r\nwatchful, but quiet spectator of the operations of nature, giving them\r\nfair play by a well regulated regimen, and by all the aid they can\r\nderive from the excitement of good spirits and hope in the patient.\r\nI have no doubt, that some diseases not yet understood may in time be\r\ntransferred to the table of those known. But, were I a physician, I\r\nwould rather leave the transfer to the slow hand of accident, than\r\nhasten it by guilty experiments on those who put their lives into my\r\nhands. The only sure foundations of medicine are, an intimate knowledge\r\nof the human body, and observation on the effects of medicinal\r\nsubstances on that. The anatomical and clinical schools, therefore, are\r\nthose in which the young physician should be formed. If he enters with\r\ninnocence that of the theory of medicine, it is scarcely possible he\r\nshould come out untainted with error. His mind must be strong indeed,\r\nif, rising above juvenile credulity, it can maintain a wise infidelity\r\nagainst the authority of his instructers, and the bewitching delusions\r\nof their theories. You see that I estimate justly that portion of\r\ninstruction, which our medical students derive from your labors; and,\r\nassociating with it one of the chairs which my old and able friend,\r\nDoctor Rush, so honorably fills, I consider them as the two fundamental\r\npillars of the edifice. Indeed, I have such an opinion of the talents\r\nof the professors in the other branches which constitute the school of\r\nmedicine with you, as to hope and believe, that it is from this side\r\nof the Atlantic, that Europe, which has taught us so many other things,\r\nwill at length be led into sound principles in this branch of science,\r\nthe most important of all others, being that to which we commit the care\r\nof health and life.\r\n\r\nI dare say, that by this time you are sufficiently sensible that old\r\nheads, as well as young, may sometimes be charged with ignorance and\r\npresumption. The natural course of the human mind is certainly from\r\ncredulity to scepticism: and this is perhaps the most favorable apology\r\nI can make for venturing so far out of my depth, and to one, too,\r\nto whom the strong as well as the weak points of this science are so\r\nfamiliar. But having stumbled on the subject in my way, I wished to give\r\na confession of my faith to a friend; and the rather, as I had perhaps,\r\nat times, to him as well as others, expressed my scepticism in medicine,\r\nwithout defining its extent or foundation. At any rate, it has permitted\r\nme, for a moment, to abstract myself from the dry and dreary waste\r\nof politics, into which I have been impressed by the times on which I\r\nhappened, and to indulge in the rich fields of nature, where alone I\r\nshould have served as a volunteer, if left to my natural inclinations\r\nand partialities.\r\n\r\nI salute you at all times with affection and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LVI.--TO MR. BOWDOIN, July 10, 1807\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BOWDOIN.\r\n\r\nWashington, July 10, 1807.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI wrote you on the 10th of July, 1806; but supposing, from your not\r\nacknowledging the receipt of the letter, that it had miscarried, I sent\r\na duplicate with my subsequent one of April the 2nd. These having gone\r\nby the Wasp, you will doubtless have received them. Since that, yours\r\nof May the 1st has come to hand. You will see by the despatches from the\r\ndepartment of State, carried by the armed vessel the Revenge, into what\r\na critical state our peace with Great Britain is suddenly brought, by\r\ntheir armed vessels in our waters. Four vessels of war (three of them\r\ntwo-deckers) closely blockade Norfolk at this instant. Of the authority\r\nunder which this aggression is committed, their minister here is\r\nunapprized. You will see by the proclamation of July the 2nd, that\r\n(while we are not omitting such measures of force as are immediately\r\nnecessary) we propose to give Great Britain an opportunity of disavowal\r\nand reparation, and to leave the question of war, non-intercourse, or\r\nother measures, uncommitted, to the legislature. This country has never\r\nbeen in such a state of excitement since the battle of Lexington. In\r\nthis state of things, cordial friendship with France, and peace at\r\nleast with Spain, become more interesting. You know the circumstances\r\nrespecting this last power, which have rendered it ineligible that you\r\nshould have proceeded heretofore to your destination. But this obstacle\r\nis now removed by their recall of Yrujo, and appointment of another\r\nminister, and, in the mean time, of a _chargé des affaires_, who has\r\nbeen received. The way being now open for taking your station at Madrid,\r\nit is certainly our wish you should do so, and that this may be more\r\nagreeable to you than your return home, as is solicited in yours of May\r\nthe 1st. It is with real unwillingness we should relinquish the benefit\r\nof your services. Nevertheless, if your mind is decidedly bent on that,\r\nwe shall regret, but not oppose your return. The choice, therefore,\r\nremains with yourself. In the mean time, your place in the joint\r\ncommission being vacated by either event, we shall take the measures\r\nrendered necessary by that. We have seen, with real grief, the\r\nmisunderstanding which has taken place between yourself and General\r\nArmstrong. We are neither qualified nor disposed to form an opinion\r\nbetween you. We regret the pain which must have been felt by persons,\r\nboth of whom hold so high a place in our esteem, and we have not been\r\nwithout fear that the public interest might suffer by it. It has seemed,\r\nhowever, that the state of Europe has been such as to admit little to be\r\ndone, in matters so distant from them.\r\n\r\nThe present alarm has had the effect of suspending our foreign commerce.\r\nNo merchant ventures to send out a single vessel; and I think it\r\nprobable this will continue very much the case till we get an answer\r\nfrom England. Our crops are uncommonly plentiful. That of small grain is\r\nnow secured south of this, and the harvest is advancing here.\r\n\r\nAccept my salutations, and assurances of affectionate esteem and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LVII.--TO THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE, July 14, 1807\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE.\r\n\r\nWashington, July 14, 1807.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Friend,\r\n\r\nI received last night your letters of February the 20th and April the\r\n29th, and a vessel just sailing from Baltimore enables me hastily to\r\nacknowledge them; to assure you of the welcome with which I receive\r\nwhatever comes from you, and the continuance of my affectionate esteem\r\nfor yourself and family. I learn with much concern, indeed, the state of\r\nMadame de la Fayette’s health. I hope I have the pleasure yet to come of\r\nlearning its entire re-establishment. She is too young not to give great\r\nconfidence to that hope.\r\n\r\nMeasuring happiness by the American scale, and sincerely wishing that of\r\nyourself and family, we had been anxious to see them established on this\r\nside of the great water. But I am not certain that any equivalent can be\r\nfound for the loss of that species of society, to which our habits have\r\nbeen formed from infancy. Certainly had you been, as I wished, at the\r\nhead of the government of Orleans, Burr would never have given me one\r\nmoment’s uneasiness. His conspiracy has been one of the most flagitious\r\nof which history will ever furnish an example. He meant to separate the\r\nwestern States from us, to add Mexico to them, place himself at their\r\nhead, establish what he would deem an energetic government, and thus\r\nprovide an example and an instrument for the subversion of our freedom.\r\nThe man who could expect to effect this, with American materials, must\r\nbe a fit subject for Bedlam. The seriousness of the crime, however,\r\ndemands more serious punishment. Yet, although there is not a man in the\r\nUnited States who doubts his guilt, such are the jealous provisions of\r\nour laws in favor of the accused against the accuser, that I question\r\nif he is convicted. Out of forty-eight jurors to be summoned, he is to\r\nselect the twelve who are to try him, and if there be any one who will\r\nnot concur in finding him guilty, he is discharged of course. I am sorry\r\nto tell you that Bollman was Burr’s right hand man in all his guilty\r\nschemes. On being brought to prison here, he communicated to Mr. Madison\r\nand myself the whole of the plans, always, however, apologetically for\r\nBurr as far as they would bear. But his subsequent tergiversations\r\nhave proved him conspicuously base. I gave him a pardon, however, which\r\ncovers him from every thing but infamy. I was the more astonished at his\r\nengaging in this business, from the peculiar motives he should have\r\nfelt for fidelity. When I came into the government, I sought him out on\r\naccount of the services he has rendered you, cherished him, offered\r\nhim two different appointments of value, which, after keeping them long\r\nunder consideration, he declined for commercial views, and would have\r\ngiven him any thing for which he was fit. Be assured he is unworthy of\r\never occupying again the care of any honest man. Nothing has ever so\r\nstrongly proved the innate force of our form of government, as this\r\nconspiracy. Burr had probably engaged one thousand men to follow his\r\nfortunes, without letting them know his projects, otherwise than by\r\nassuring them the government approved of them. The moment a proclamation\r\nwas issued, undeceiving them, he found himself left with about thirty\r\ndesperadoes only. The people rose in mass wherever he was or was\r\nsuspected to be, and by their own energy the thing was crushed in\r\none instant, without its having been necessary to employ a man of\r\nthe military but to take care of their respective stations. His first\r\nenterprise was to have been to seize New Orleans, which he supposed\r\nwould powerfully bridle the upper country, and place him at the door\r\nof Mexico. It is with pleasure I inform you that not a single native\r\nCreole, and but one American of those settled there before we received\r\nthe place, took any part with him. His partisans were the new emigrants\r\nfrom the United States and elsewhere, fugitives from justice or debt,\r\nand adventurers and speculators of all descriptions.\r\n\r\nI enclose you a proclamation, which will show you the critical footing\r\non which we stand, at present, with England. Never, since the battle of\r\nLexington, have I seen this country in such a state of exasperation\r\nas at present. And even that did not produce such unanimity. The\r\nfederalists themselves coalesce with us as to the object, although they\r\nwill return to their old trade of condemning every step we take towards\r\nobtaining it. ‘Reparation for the past, and security for the future,’ is\r\nour motto. Whether these will be yielded freely, or will require resort\r\nto non-intercourse, or to war, is yet to be seen. We have actually near\r\ntwo thousand men in the field, covering the exposed parts of the coast,\r\nand cutting off supplies from the British vessels.\r\n\r\nI am afraid I have been very unsuccessful in my endeavors to serve\r\nMadame de Tesse in her taste for planting. A box of seeds, &c. which I\r\nsent her in the close of 1805, was carried with the vessel into England,\r\nand discharged so late that I fear she lost their benefit, for that\r\nseason. Another box, which I prepared in the autumn of 1806, has,\r\nI fear, been equally delayed from other accidents. However, I will\r\npersevere in my endeavors.\r\n\r\nPresent me respectfully to her, M. de Tesse, Madame de la Fayette, and\r\nyour family, and accept my affectionate salutations, and assurances of\r\nconstant esteem and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LVIII.--TO JOHN PAGE, July 17, 1807\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN PAGE.\r\n\r\nWashington, July 17, 1807.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Friend,\r\n\r\nYours of the 11th is received. In appointments to public offices of mere\r\nprofit, I have ever considered faithful service in either our first or\r\nsecond revolution as giving preference of claim, and that appointments\r\non that principle would gratify the public, and strengthen that\r\nconfidence so necessary to enable the executive to direct the whole\r\npublic force to the best, advantage of the nation. Of Mr. Boiling\r\nRobertson’s talents and integrity I have long been apprized, and would\r\ngladly use them where talents and integrity are wanting. I had thought\r\nof him for the vacant place of secretary of the Orleans territory, but\r\nsupposing the salary of two thousand dollars not more than he makes\r\nby his profession, and while remaining with his friends, I have, in\r\ndespair, not proposed it to him. If he would accept it, I should name\r\nhim instantly with the greatest satisfaction. Perhaps you could inform\r\nme on this point.\r\n\r\nWith respect to Major Gibbons, I do indeed recollect, that in some\r\ncasual conversation, it was said that the most conspicuous accomplices\r\nof Burr were at home at his house; but it made so little impression on\r\nme, that neither the occasion nor the person is now recollected. On this\r\nsubject, I have often expressed the principles on which I act, with a\r\nwish they might be understood by the federalists in office. I have never\r\nremoved a man merely because he was a federalist: I have never wished\r\nthem to give a vote at an election, but according to their own wishes.\r\nBut as no government could discharge its duties to the best advantage\r\nof its citizens, if its agents were in a regular course of thwarting\r\ninstead of executing all its measures, and were employing the patronage\r\nand influence of their offices against the government and its measures,\r\nI have only requested they would be quiet, and they should be safe: and\r\nif their conscience urges them to take an active and zealous part in\r\nopposition, it ought also to urge them to retire from a post which they\r\ncould not conscientiously conduct with fidelity to the trust reposed\r\nin them; and on failure to retire, I have removed them; that is to say,\r\nthose who maintained an active and zealous opposition to the government.\r\nNothing which I have yet heard of Major Gibbons places him in danger\r\nfrom these principles.\r\n\r\nI am much pleased with the ardor displayed by our countrymen on the\r\nlate British outrage. It gives us the more confidence of support in the\r\ndemand of reparation for the past, and security for the future, that is\r\nto say, an end of impressments. If motives of either justice or interest\r\nshould produce this from Great Britain, it will save a war: but if they\r\nare refused, we shall have gained time for getting in our ships and\r\nproperty, and at least twenty thousand seamen now afloat on the ocean,\r\nand who may man two hundred and fifty privateers. The loss of these\r\nto us would be worth to Great Britain many victories of the Nile\r\nand Trafalgar. The mean time may also be importantly employed in\r\npreparations to enable us to give quick and deep blows.\r\n\r\nPresent to Mrs. Page, and receive yourself my affectionate and\r\nrespectful salutations.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LIX.--TO WILLIAM DUANE, July 20, 1807\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM DUANE.\r\n\r\nWashington, July 20, 1807.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nAlthough I cannot always acknowledge the receipt of communications, yet\r\nI merit their continuance by making all the use of them of which they\r\nare susceptible. Some of your suggestions had occurred, and others will\r\nbe considered. The time is coming when our friends must enable us to\r\nhear every thing, and expect us to say nothing; when we shall need all\r\ntheir confidence that every thing is doing which can be done, and when\r\nour greatest praise shall be, that we appear to be doing nothing. The\r\nlaw for detaching one hundred thousand militia, and the appropriation\r\nfor it, and that for fortifications, enable us to do every thing for\r\nland service, as well as if Congress were here; and as to naval matters,\r\ntheir opinion is known. The course we have pursued, has gained for our\r\nmerchants a precious interval to call in their property and our seamen,\r\nand the postponing the summons of Congress will aid in avoiding to give\r\ntoo quick an alarm to the adversary. They will be called, however,\r\nin good time. Although we demand of England what is merely of right,\r\nreparation for the past, security for the future, yet as their pride\r\nwill possibly, nay probably, prevent their yielding them to the extent\r\nwe shall require, my opinion is, that the public mind, which I believe\r\nis made up for war, should maintain itself at that point. They have\r\noften enough, God knows, given us cause of war before; but it has been\r\non points which would not have united the nation. But now they have\r\ntouched a chord which vibrates in every heart. Now then is the time to\r\nsettle the old and the new.\r\n\r\nI have often wished for an occasion of saying a word to you on the\r\nsubject of the Emperor of Russia, of whose character and value to us, I\r\nsuspect you are not apprized correctly. A more virtuous man, I believe,\r\ndoes not exist, nor one who is more enthusiastically devoted to better\r\nthe condition of mankind. He will probably, one day, fall a victim to\r\nit, as a monarch of that principle does not suit a Russian noblesse.\r\nHe is not of the very first order of understanding, but he is of a\r\nhigh one. He has taken a peculiar affection to this country and its\r\ngovernment, of which he has given me public as well as personal proofs.\r\nOur nation being like his, habitually neutral, our interests as to\r\nneutral rights, and our sentiments, agree. And whenever conferences\r\nfor peace shall take place, we are assured of a friend in him. In fact,\r\nalthough in questions of restitution he will be with England, in those\r\nof neutral rights he will be with Bonaparte and every other power in\r\nthe world, except England: and I do presume that England will never have\r\npeace until she subscribes to a just code of marine law. I have gone\r\ninto this subject, because I am confident that Russia (while her present\r\nmonarch lives) is the most cordially friendly to us of any power on\r\nearth, will go furthest to serve us, and is most worthy of conciliation.\r\nAnd although the source of this information must be a matter of\r\nconfidence with you, yet it is desirable that the sentiments should\r\nbecome those of the nation. I salute you with esteem and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LX.--TO GEORGE HAY, August 20, 1807\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE HAY.\r\n\r\nMonticello, August 20, 1807.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI received yesterday your favor of the 11th. An error of the post-office\r\nhad occasioned the delay. Before an impartial jury Burr’s conduct would\r\nconvict himself, were not one word of testimony to be offered against\r\nhim. But to what a state will our law be reduced by party feelings in\r\nthose who administer it? Why do not Blannerhasset, Dayton, &c.\r\ndemand private and comfortable lodgings? In a country where an equal\r\napplication of law to every condition of man is fundamental, how could\r\nit be denied to them? How can it ever be denied to the most degraded\r\nmalefactor? The enclosed letter of James Morrison, covering a copy of\r\none from Alston to Blannerhasset, came to hand yesterday. I enclose\r\nthem, because it is proper all these papers should be in one deposite,\r\nand because you should know the case and all its bearings, that you may\r\nunderstand whatever turns up in the cause. Whether the opinion of the\r\nletter-writer is sound, may be doubted. For however these, and other\r\ncircumstances which have come to us, may induce us to believe that the\r\nbouncing letter he published, and the insolent one he wrote to me, were\r\nintended as blinds, yet they are not sufficient for legal conviction.\r\nBlannerhasset and his wife could possibly tell us enough. I commiserate\r\nthe sufferings you have to go through in such a season, and salute you\r\nwith great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXI.--TO GEORGE HAY, September 4, 1807\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE HAY.\r\n\r\nMonticello, September 4, 1807.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYours of the 1st came to hand yesterday. The event has been ------\r\nthat is to say, not only to clear Burr, but to prevent the evidence from\r\never going before the world. But this latter case must not take place.\r\nIt is now, therefore, more than ever indispensable, that not a single\r\nwitness be paid or permitted to depart, until his testimony has been\r\ncommitted to writing, either as delivered in court, or as taken by\r\nyourself in the presence of any of Burr’s counsel, who may choose to\r\nattend to cross-examine. These whole proceedings will be laid before\r\nCongress, that they may decide, whether the defect has been in the\r\nevidence of guilt, or in the law, or in the application of the law, and\r\nthat they may provide the proper remedy for the past and the future. I\r\nmust pray you also to have an authentic copy of the record made out\r\n(without saying for what) and to send it to me: if the Judge’s opinions\r\nmake not a part of it, then I must ask a copy of them, either under his\r\nhand, if he delivers one signed, or duly proved by affidavit.\r\n\r\nThis criminal is preserved to become the rallying point of all the\r\ndisaffected and the worthless of the United States, and to be the\r\npivot on which all the intrigues and the conspiracies which foreign\r\ngovernments may wish to disturb us with, are to turn. If he is convicted\r\nof the misdemeanor, the Judge must in decency give us respite by some\r\nshort confinement of him; but we must expect it to be very short.\r\nBe assured yourself, and communicate the same assurances to your\r\ncolleagues, that your and their zeal and abilities have been displayed\r\nin this affair to my entire satisfaction and your own honor.\r\n\r\nI salute you with great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXII.--TO GEORGE HAY, September 7, 1807\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE HAY.\r\n\r\nMonticello, September 7, 1807.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI received, late last night, your favor of the day before, and now\r\nre-enclose you the subpoena. As I do not believe that the district\r\ncourts have a power of commanding the executive government to abandon\r\nsuperior duties and attend on them, at whatever distance, I am\r\nunwilling, by any notice of the subpoena, to set a precedent which\r\nmight sanction a proceeding so preposterous. I enclose you, therefore, a\r\nletter, public and for the court, covering substantially all they ought\r\nto desire. If the papers which were enclosed in Wilkinson’s letter may,\r\nin your judgment, be communicated without injury, you will be pleased to\r\ncommunicate them. I return you the original letter.\r\n\r\nI am happy in having the benefit of Mr. Madison’s counsel on this\r\noccasion, he happening to be now with me. We are both strongly of\r\nopinion, that the prosecution against Burr for misdemeanor should\r\nproceed at Richmond. If defeated, it will heap coals of fire on the\r\nhead of the Judge: if successful, it will give time to see whether a\r\nprosecution for treason against him can be instituted in any, and\r\nwhat other court. But, we incline to think, it may be best to send\r\nBlannerhasset and Smith (Israel) to Kentucky, to be tried both for the\r\ntreason and misdemeanor. The trial of Dayton for misdemeanor may as well\r\ngo on at Richmond.\r\n\r\nI salute you with great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXIII.--TO THE REV. MR. MILLAR, January 23, 1808\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE REV. MR. MILLAR,\r\n\r\nWashington, January 23, 1808.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have duly received your favor of the 18th, and am thankful to you\r\nfor having written it, because it is more agreeable to prevent than to\r\nrefuse what I do not think myself authorized to comply with. I consider\r\nthe government of the United States as interdicted by the constitution\r\nfrom intermeddling with religious institutions, their doctrines,\r\ndiscipline, or exercises. This results not only from the provision that\r\nno law shall be made respecting the establishment or free exercise of\r\nreligion, but from that also which reserves to the States the powers\r\nnot delegated to the United States. Certainly, no power to prescribe any\r\nreligious exercise, or to assume authority in religious discipline, has\r\nbeen delegated to the General Government. It must then rest with the\r\nStates, as far as it can be in any human authority. But it is only\r\nproposed that I should recommend, not prescribe, a day of fasting and\r\nprayer. That is, that I should indirectly assume to the United States an\r\nauthority over religious exercises, which the constitution has directly\r\nprecluded them from. It must be meant, too, that this recommendation is\r\nto carry some authority, and to be sanctioned by some penalty on those\r\nwho disregard it; not indeed of fine and imprisonment, but of some\r\ndegree of proscription, perhaps in public opinion. And does the change\r\nin the nature of the penalty make the recommendation the less a law of\r\nconduct for those to whom it is directed? I do not believe it is for\r\nthe interest of religion to invite the civil magistrate to direct\r\nits exercises, its discipline, or its doctrines; nor of the religious\r\nsocieties, that the General Government should be invested with the power\r\nof effecting any uniformity of time or matter among them. Fasting and\r\nprayer are religious exercises; the enjoining them an act of discipline.\r\nEvery religious society has a right to determine for itself the times\r\nfor these exercises, and the objects proper for them, according to their\r\nown particular tenets; and this right can never be safer than in their\r\nown hands, where the constitution has deposited it.\r\n\r\nI am aware that the practice of my predecessors may be quoted. But I\r\nhave ever believed, that the example of State executives led to the\r\nassumption of that authority by the General Government, without due\r\nexamination, which would have discovered that what might be a right in a\r\nState government, was a violation of that right when assumed by another.\r\nBe this as it may, every one must act according to the dictates of his\r\nown reason, and mine tells me that civil powers alone have been given\r\nto the President of the United States, and no authority to direct the\r\nreligious exercises of his constituents.\r\n\r\nI again express my satisfaction that you have been so good as to give\r\nme an opportunity of explaining myself in a private letter, in which\r\nI could give my reasons more in detail than might have been done in a\r\npublic answer: and I pray you to accept the assurances of my high esteem\r\nand respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXIV.--TO COLONEL MONROE, February 18, 1808\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\nWashington, February 18, 1808.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nYou informed me that the instruments you had been so kind as to bring\r\nfor me from England, would arrive at Richmond with your baggage, and you\r\nwished to know what was to be done with them there. I will ask the\r\nfavor of you to deliver them to Mr. Jefferson, who will forward them\r\nto Monticello in the way I shall advise him. And I must intreat you\r\nto send me either a note of their amount, or the bills, that I may be\r\nenabled to reimburse you. There can be no pecuniary matter between\r\nus, against which this can be any set-off. But if, contrary to my\r\nrecollection or knowledge, there were any thing, I pray that that may\r\nbe left to be settled by itself. If I could have known the amount\r\nbeforehand, I should have remitted it, and asked the advance only\r\nunder the idea that it should be the same as ready money to you on your\r\narrival. I must again, therefore, beseech you to let me know its amount.\r\n\r\nI see with infinite grief a contest arising between yourself and\r\nanother, who have been very dear to each other, and equally so to me. I\r\nsincerely pray that these dispositions may not be affected between you;\r\nwith me I confidently trust they will not. For independently of the\r\ndictates of public duty, which prescribes neutrality to me, my sincere\r\nfriendship for you both will insure its sacred observance. I suffer no\r\none to converse with me on the subject. I already perceive my old friend\r\nClinton estranging himself from me. No doubt lies are carried to him,\r\nas they will be to the other two candidates, under forms, which, however\r\nfalse he can scarcely question. Yet I have been equally careful as to\r\nhim also, never to say a word on his subject. The object of the contest\r\nis a fair and honorable one, equally open to you all; and I have no\r\ndoubt the personal conduct of all will be so chaste, as to offer no\r\nground of dissatisfaction with each other. But your friends will not be\r\nas delicate. I know too well from experience the progress of political\r\ncontroversy, and the exacerbation of spirit into which it degenerates,\r\nnot to fear for the continuance of your mutual esteem. One piquing\r\nthing said, draws on another, that a third, and always with increasing\r\nacrimony, until all restraint is thrown off, and it becomes difficult\r\nfor yourselves to keep clear of the toils in which your friends will\r\nendeavor to interlace you, and to avoid the participation in their\r\npassions which they will endeavor to produce. A candid recollection of\r\nwhat you know of each other will be the true corrective. With respect\r\nto myself, I hope they will spare me. My longings for retirement are\r\nso strong, that I with difficulty encounter the daily drudgeries of my\r\nduty. But my wish for retirement itself is not stronger than that of\r\ncarrying into it the affections of all my friends. I have ever viewed\r\nMr. Madison and yourself as two principal pillars of my happiness.\r\nWere either to be withdrawn, I should consider it as among the greatest\r\ncalamities which could assail my future peace of mind. I have great\r\nconfidence that the candor and high understanding of both will guard\r\nme against this misfortune, the bare possibility of which has so far\r\nweighed on my mind, that I could not be easy without unburthening it.\r\n\r\nAccept my respectful salutations for yourself and Mrs. Monroe, and be\r\nassured of my constant and sincere friendship.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXV.--TO COLONEL MONROE, March 10, 1808\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\nWashington, March 10, 1808.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nFrom your letter of the 27th ultimo, I perceive that painful impressions\r\nhave been made on your mind during your late mission, of which I had\r\nnever entertained a suspicion. I must, therefore, examine the grounds,\r\nbecause explanations between reasonable men can never but do good. 1.\r\nYou consider the mission of Mr. Pinckney as an associate, to have been\r\nin some way injurious to you. Were I to take that measure on myself,\r\nI might say in its justification, that it has been the regular and\r\nhabitual practice of the United States to do this, under every form\r\nin which their government has existed. I need not recapitulate the\r\nmultiplied instances, because you will readily recollect them. I went as\r\nan adjunct to Dr. Franklin and Mr. Adams, yourself as an adjunct first\r\nto Mr. Livingston, and then to Mr. Pinckney, and I really believe\r\nthere has scarcely been a great occasion which has not produced an\r\nextraordinary mission. Still, however, it is well known, that I was\r\nstrongly opposed to it in the case of which you complain. A committee of\r\nthe Senate called on me with two resolutions of that body on the subject\r\nof impressment and spoliations by Great Britain, and requesting that\r\nI would demand satisfaction. After delivering the resolutions, the\r\ncommittee entered into free conversation, and observed, that although\r\nthe Senate could not, in form, recommend any extraordinary mission,\r\nyet that as individuals, there was but one sentiment among them on the\r\nmeasure, and they pressed it. I was so much averse to it, and gave them\r\nso hard an answer, that they felt it, and spoke of it. But it did not\r\nend here. The members of the other House took up the subject, and set\r\nupon me individually, and these the best friends to you, as well as\r\nmyself, and represented the responsibility which a failure to obtain\r\nredress would throw on us both, pursuing a conduct in opposition to the\r\nopinion of nearly every member of the legislature. I found it necessary,\r\nat length, to yield my own opinion, to the general sense of the national\r\ncouncil, and it really seemed to produce a jubilee among them; not from\r\nany want of confidence in you, but from a belief in the effect which an\r\nextraordinary mission would have on the British mind, by demonstrating\r\nthe degree of importance which this country attached to the rights which\r\nwe considered as infracted.\r\n\r\n2. You complain of the manner in which the treaty was received. But what\r\nwas that manner? I cannot suppose you to have given a moment’s credit\r\nto the stuff which was crowded in all sorts of forms into the public\r\npapers, or to the thousand speeches they put into my mouth, not a word\r\nof which I had ever uttered. I was not insensible at the time of\r\nthe views to mischief, with which these lies were fabricated. But my\r\nconfidence was firm, that neither yourself nor the British government,\r\nequally outraged by them, would believe me capable of making the editors\r\nof newspapers the confidants of my speeches or opinions. The fact\r\nwas this. The treaty was communicated to us by Mr. Erskine on the day\r\nCongress was to rise. Two of the Senators inquired of me in the evening,\r\nwhether it was my purpose to detain them on account of the treaty. My\r\nanswer was, ‘that it was not: that the treaty containing no provision\r\nagainst the impressment of our seamen, and being accompanied by a\r\nkind of protestation of the British ministers, which would leave that\r\ngovernment free to consider it as a treaty or no treaty, according\r\nto their own convenience, I should not give them the trouble of\r\ndeliberating on it.’ This was substantially, and almost verbally, what\r\nI said whenever spoken to about it, and I never failed when the occasion\r\nwould admit of it, to justify yourself and Mr. Pinckney, by expressing\r\nmy conviction, that it was all that could be obtained from the British\r\ngovernment; that you had told their commissioners that your government\r\ncould not be pledged to ratify, because it was contrary to their\r\ninstructions; of course, that it should be considered but as a projet;\r\nand in this light I stated it publicly in my message to Congress on the\r\nopening of the session. Not a single article of the treaty was ever made\r\nknown beyond the members of the administration, nor would an article of\r\nit be known at this day, but for its publication in the newspapers,\r\nas communicated by somebody from beyond the water, as we have always\r\nunderstood. But as to myself, I can solemnly protest, as the most sacred\r\nof truths, that I never, one instant, lost sight of your reputation and\r\nfavorable standing with your country, and never omitted to justify your\r\nfailure to attain our wish, as one which was probably unattainable.\r\nReviewing, therefore, this whole subject, I cannot doubt you will become\r\nsensible, that your impressions have been without just ground. I cannot,\r\nindeed, judge what falsehoods may have been written or told you; and\r\nthat, under such forms as to command belief. But you will soon find,\r\nmy dear Sir, that so inveterate is the rancor of party spirit among us,\r\nthat nothing ought to be credited but what we hear with our own ears. If\r\nyou are less on your guard than we are here, at this moment, the designs\r\nof the mischief-makers will not fail to be accomplished, and brethren\r\nand friends will be made strangers and enemies to each other, without\r\never having said or thought a thing amiss of each other. I presume that\r\nthe most insidious falsehoods are daily carried to you, as they are\r\nbrought to me, to engage us in the passions of our informers, and stated\r\nso positively and plausibly as to make even doubt a rudeness to the\r\nnarrator; who, imposed on himself, has no other than the friendly view\r\nof putting us on our guard. My answer is, invariably, that my knowledge\r\nof your character is better testimony to me of a negative, than any\r\naffirmative which my informant did not hear from yourself with his own\r\nears. In fact, when you shall have been a little longer among us, you\r\nwill find that little is to be believed which interests the prevailing\r\npassions, and happens beyond the limits of our own senses. Let us not\r\nthen, my dear friend, embark our happiness and our affections on the\r\nocean of slander, of falsehood, and of malice, on which our credulous\r\nfriends are floating. If you have been made to believe that I ever did,\r\nsaid, or thought a thing unfriendly to your fame and feelings, you do me\r\ninjury as causeless as it is afflicting to me. In the present contest in\r\nwhich you are concerned, I feel no passion, I take no part, I express no\r\nsentiment. Whichever of my friends is called to the supreme cares of the\r\nnation, I know that they will be wisely and faithfully administered, and\r\nas far as my individual conduct can influence, they shall be cordially\r\nsupported,\r\n\r\nFor myself I have nothing further to ask of the world, than to preserve\r\nin retirement so much of their esteem as I may have fairly earned, and\r\nto be permitted to pass in tranquillity, in the bosom of my family and\r\nfriends, the days which yet remain for me. Having reached the harbor\r\nmyself, I shall view with anxiety (but certainly not with a wish to be\r\nin their place) those who are still buffeting the storm, uncertain\r\nof their fate. Your voyage has so far been favorable, and that it\r\nmay continue with entire prosperity, is the sincere prayer of that\r\nfriendship which I have ever borne you, and of which I now assure you,\r\nwith the tender of my high respect and affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXVI.--TO RICHARD M. JOHNSON, March 10, 1808\r\n\r\n\r\nTO RICHARD M. JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nWashington, March 10, 1808.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI am sure you can too justly estimate my occupations, to need an apology\r\nfor this tardy acknowledgment of your favor of February the 27th. I\r\ncannot but be deeply sensible of the good opinion you are pleased to\r\nexpress of my conduct in the administration of our government. This\r\napprobation of my fellow-citizens is the richest reward I can receive. I\r\nam conscious of having always intended to do what was best for them: and\r\nnever, for a single moment, to have listened to any personal interest\r\nof my own. It has been a source of great pain to me, to have met with\r\nso many among our opponents, who had not the liberality to distinguish\r\nbetween political and social opposition; who transferred at once to\r\nthe person, the hatred they bore to his political opinions. I suppose,\r\nindeed, that in public life, a man whose political principles have any\r\ndecided character, and who has energy enough to give them effect, must\r\nalways expect to encounter political hostility from those of adverse\r\nprinciples. But I came to the government under circumstances calculated\r\nto generate peculiar acrimony. I found all its offices in the possession\r\nof a political sect, who wished to transform it ultimately into the\r\nshape of their darling model, the English government; and in the mean\r\ntime, to familiarize the public mind to the change, by administering it\r\non English principles, and in English forms. The elective interposition\r\nof the people had blown all their designs, and they found themselves and\r\ntheir fortresses of power and profit put in a moment into the hands of\r\nother trustees. Lamentations and invective were all that remained to\r\nthem. This last was naturally directed against the agent selected to\r\nexecute the multiplied reformations, which their heresies had rendered\r\nnecessary. I became of course the butt of every thing which reason,\r\nridicule, malice, and falsehood could supply. They have concentrated all\r\ntheir hatred on me, till they have really persuaded themselves, that I\r\nam the sole source of all their imaginary evils. I hope, therefore, that\r\nmy retirement will abate some of their disaffection to the government of\r\ntheir country, and that my successor will enter on a calmer sea than\r\nI did. He will at least find the vessel of state in the hands of his\r\nfriends, and not of his foes. Federalism is dead, without even the hope\r\nof a day of resurrection. The quondam leaders, indeed, retain their\r\nrancor and principles; but their followers are amalgamated with us\r\nin sentiment, if not in name. If our fellow-citizens, now solidly\r\nrepublican, will sacrifice favoritism towards men for the preservation\r\nof principle, we may hope that no divisions will again endanger a\r\ndegeneracy in our government.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nI pray you to accept my salutations, and assurances of great esteem and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXVII.--TO LEVI LINCOLN, March 23, 1808\r\n\r\n\r\nTO LEVI LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nWashington, March 23, 1808.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour letter on the subject of Mr. Lee came safely to hand. You know\r\nour principles render federalists in office safe, if they do not employ\r\ntheir influence in opposing the government, but only give their own vote\r\naccording to their conscience. And this principle we act on as well with\r\nthose put in office by others, as by ourselves.\r\n\r\nWe have received from your presses a very malevolent and incendiary\r\ndenunciation of the administration, bottomed on absolute falsehood from\r\nbeginning to end. The author would merit exemplary punishment for so\r\nflagitious a libel, were not the torment of his own abominable temper\r\npunishment sufficient for even as base a crime as this. The termination\r\nof Mr. Rose’s mission, _re infectâ_, put it in my power to communicate\r\nto Congress yesterday, every thing respecting our relations with England\r\nand France, which will effectually put down Mr. Pickering, and his\r\nworthy coadjutor Quincy. Their tempers are so much alike, and really\r\ntheir persons, as to induce a supposition that they are related. The\r\nembargo appears to be approved, even by the federalists of every quarter\r\nexcept yours. The alternative was between that and war, and, in fact,\r\nit is the last card we have to play, short of war. But if peace does\r\nnot take place in Europe, and if France and England will not consent\r\nto withdraw the operation of their decrees and orders from us, when\r\nCongress shall meet in December, they will have to consider at what\r\npoint of time the embargo, continued, becomes a greater evil than war. I\r\nam inclined to believe, we shall have this summer and autumn to prepare\r\nfor the defence of our sea-port towns, and hope that in that time the\r\nworks of defence will be completed, which have been provided for by the\r\nlegislature. I think Congress will rise within three weeks. I salute you\r\nwith great affection and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXVIII.--TO CHARLES PINCKNEY, March 30, 1808\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES PINCKNEY.\r\n\r\nWashington, March 30, 1808.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 8th was received on the 25th, and I proceed to state\r\nto you my views of the present state and prospect of foreign affairs,\r\nunder the confidence that you will use them for your own government and\r\nopinions only, and by no means let them get out as from me. With France\r\nwe are in no immediate danger of war. Her future views it is impossible\r\nto estimate. The immediate danger we are in of a rupture with England,\r\nis postponed for this year. This is effected by the embargo, as the\r\nquestion was simply between that and war. That may go on a certain time,\r\nperhaps through the year, without the loss of their property to our\r\ncitizens, but only its remaining unemployed on their hands. A time would\r\ncome, however, when war would be preferable to a continuance of the\r\nembargo. Of this Congress may have to decide at their next meeting. In\r\nthe mean time, we have good information, that a negotiation for peace\r\nbetween France and England is commencing through the medium of Austria.\r\nThe way for it has been smoothed by a determination expressed by France\r\n(through the Moniteur, which is their government paper), that herself\r\nand her allies will demand from Great Britain no renunciation of her\r\nmaritime principles; nor will they renounce theirs. Nothing shall be\r\nsaid about them in the treaty, and both sides will be left in the next\r\nwar to act on their own. No doubt the meaning of this is, that all\r\nthe Continental powers of Europe will form themselves into an armed\r\nneutrality, to enforce their own principles. Should peace be made, we\r\nshall have safely rode out the storm in peace and prosperity. If we have\r\nany thing to fear, it will be after that. Nothing should be spared from\r\nthis moment in putting our militia into the best condition possible,\r\nand procuring arms. I hope, that this summer, we shall get our whole\r\nsea-ports put into that state of defence, which Congress has thought\r\nproportioned to our circumstances and situation; that is to say, put\r\n_hors d’insulte_ from a maritime attack, by a moderate squadron. If\r\narmies are combined with their fleets, then no resource can be provided,\r\nbut to meet them in the field. We propose to raise seven regiments only\r\nfor the present year, depending always on our militia for the operations\r\nof the first year of war. On any other plan, we should be obliged always\r\nto keep a large standing army. Congress will adjourn in about three\r\nweeks. I hope Captain McComb is going on well with your defensive works.\r\nWe shall be able by mid-summer, to give you a sufficient number of\r\ngun-boats to protect Charleston from any vessels which can cross the\r\nbar; but the militia of the place must be depended on to fill up the\r\ncomplement of men necessary for action in the moment of an attack, as we\r\nshall man them, in ordinary, but with their navigating crew of eight or\r\nten good seamen. I salute you with great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXIX.--TO DOCTOR LEIB, June 23, 1808\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR LEIB.\r\n\r\nWashington, June 23, 1808.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have duly received your favor covering a copy of the talk to the\r\nTammany society, for which I thank you, and particularly for the\r\nfavorable sentiments expressed towards myself. Certainly, nothing will\r\nso much sweeten the tranquillity and comfort of retirement, as the\r\nknowledge that I carry with me the good will and approbation of my\r\nrepublican fellow-citizens, and especially of the individuals in unison\r\nwith whom I have so long acted. With respect to the federalists, I\r\nbelieve we think alike; for when speaking of them, we never mean to\r\ninclude a worthy portion of our fellow-citizens, who consider themselves\r\nas in duty bound to support the constituted authorities of every branch,\r\nand to reserve their opposition to the period of election. These having\r\nacquired the appellation of federalists, while a federal administration\r\nwas in place, have not cared about throwing off their name, but,\r\nadhering to their principle, are the supporters of the present order\r\nof things. The other branch of the federalists, those who are so in\r\nprinciple as well as in name, disapprove of the republican principles\r\nand features of our constitution, and would, I believe, welcome any\r\npublic calamity (war with England excepted) which might lessen the\r\nconfidence of our country in those principles and forms. I have\r\ngenerally considered them rather as subjects for a madhouse. But they\r\nare now playing a game of the most mischievous tendency, without perhaps\r\nbeing themselves aware of it. They are endeavoring to convince England,\r\nthat we suffer more by the embargo than they do, and that, if they will\r\nbut hold out a while, we must abandon it. It is true, the time will come\r\nwhen we must abandon it. But if this is before the repeal of the orders\r\nof council, we must abandon it only for a state of war. The day is not\r\ndistant, when that will be preferable to a longer continuance of the\r\nembargo. But we can never remove that, and let our vessels go out and be\r\ntaken under these orders, without making reprisal. Yet this is the very\r\nstate of things which these federal monarchists are endeavoring to bring\r\nabout; and in this it is but too possible they may succeed. But the\r\nfact is, that if we have war with England, it will be solely produced by\r\ntheir manoeuvres. I think that in two or three months we shall know what\r\nwill be the issue. I salute you with esteem and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXX.--TO ROBERT L. LIVINGSTON, October 15, 1808\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ROBERT L. LIVINGSTON.\r\n\r\nWashington, October 15, 1808.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nYour letter of September the 22nd waited here for my return, and it is\r\nnot till now that I have been able to acknowledge it. The explanation\r\nof his principles, given you by the French Emperor, in conversation,\r\nis correct as far as it goes. He does not wish us to go to war with\r\nEngland, knowing we have no ships to carry on that war. To submit to pay\r\nto England the tribute on our commerce which she demands by her orders\r\nof council, would be to aid her in the war against him, and would give\r\nhim just ground to declare war with us. He concludes, therefore,\r\nas every rational man must, that the embargo, the only remaining\r\nalternative, was a wise measure. These are acknowledged principles, and\r\nshould circumstances arise, which may offer advantage to our country in\r\nmaking them public, we shall avail ourselves of them. But as it is not\r\nusual nor agreeable to governments to bring their conversations before\r\nthe public, I think it would be well to consider this on your part as\r\nconfidential, leaving to the government to retain or make it public,\r\nas the general good may require. Had the Emperor gone further, and said\r\nthat he condemned our vessels going voluntarily into his ports in breach\r\nof his municipal laws, we might have admitted it rigorously legal,\r\nthough not friendly. But his condemnation of vessels taken on the high\r\nseas by his privateers, and carried involuntarily into his ports, is\r\njustifiable by no law, is piracy, and this is the wrong we complain of\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\nSupposing that you may be still at Clermont, from whence your letter is\r\ndated, I avail myself of this circumstance to request your presenting my\r\nfriendly respects to Chancellor Livingston.\r\n\r\nI salute you with esteem and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXI.--TO DOCTOR JAMES BROWN, October 27, 1808\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR JAMES BROWN.\r\n\r\nWashington, October 27, 1808.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYou will wonder that your letter of June the 3rd should not be\r\nacknowledged till this date. I never received it till September the\r\n12th, and coming soon after to this place, the accumulation of business\r\nI found here has prevented my taking it up till now. That you ever\r\nparticipated in any plan for a division of the Union, I never for one\r\nmoment believed. I knew your Americanism too well. But as the enterprise\r\nagainst Mexico was of a very different character, I had supposed what I\r\nheard on that subject to be possible. You disavow it; that is enough for\r\nme, and I for ever dismiss the idea. I wish it were possible to extend\r\nmy belief of innocence to a very different description of men in New\r\nOrleans; but I think there is sufficient evidence of there being there a\r\nset of foreign adventurers, and native malcontents, who would concur\r\nin any enterprise to separate that country from this. I did wish to\r\nsee these people get what they deserved; and under the maxim of the law\r\nitself, that _inter arma silent leges_, that in an encampment expecting\r\ndaily attack from a powerful enemy, self-preservation is paramount to\r\nall law, I expected that instead of invoking the forms of the law to\r\ncover traitors, all good citizens would have concurred in securing them.\r\nShould we have ever gained our Revolution, if we had bound our hands by\r\nmanacles of the law, not only in the beginning, but in any part of the\r\nrevolutionary conflict? There are extreme cases where the laws become\r\ninadequate even to their own preservation, and where the universal\r\nresource is a dictator, or martial law. Was New Orleans in that\r\nsituation? Although we knew here that the force destined against it was\r\nsuppressed on the Ohio, yet we supposed this unknown at New Orleans at\r\nthe time that Burr’s accomplices were calling in the aid of the law to\r\nenable them to perpetrate its suppression, and that it was reasonable,\r\naccording to the state of information there, to act on the expectation\r\nof a daily attack. Of this you are the best judge.\r\n\r\nBurr is in London, and is giving out to his friends that that government\r\noffers him two millions of dollars the moment he can raise an ensign of\r\nrebellion as big as an handkerchief. Some of his partisans will believe\r\nthis, because they wish it. But those who know him best will not believe\r\nit the more because he says it. For myself, even in his most flattering\r\nperiods of the conspiracy, I never entertained one moment’s fear. My\r\nlong and intimate knowledge of my countrymen satisfied and satisfies me,\r\nthat, let there ever be occasion to display the banners of the law,\r\nand the world will see how few and pitiful are those who shall array\r\nthemselves in opposition. I as little fear foreign invasion. I have\r\nindeed thought it a duty to be prepared to meet even the most powerful,\r\nthat of a Bonaparte, for instance, by the only means competent, that of\r\na classification of the militia, and placing the junior classes at the\r\npublic disposal: but the lesson he receives in Spain extirpates all\r\napprehensions from my mind. If, in a peninsula, the neck of which is\r\nadjacent to him, and at his command, where he can march any army without\r\nthe possibility of interception or obstruction from any foreign power,\r\nhe finds it necessary to begin with an army of three hundred thousand\r\nmen, to subdue a nation of five millions, brutalized by ignorance, and\r\nenervated by long peace, and should find constant reinforcements of\r\nthousands after thousands necessary to effect at last a conquest as\r\ndoubtful as deprecated, what numbers would be necessary against eight\r\nmillions of free Americans, spread over such an extent of country\r\nas would wear him down by mere marching, by want of food, autumnal\r\ndiseases, &c.? How would they be brought, and how reinforced, across an\r\nocean of three thousand miles, in possession of a bitter enemy, whose\r\npeace, like the repose of a dog, is never more than momentary? And for\r\nwhat? For nothing but hard blows. If the Orleanese Creoles would but\r\ncontemplate these truths, they would cling to the American Union, soul\r\nand body, as their first affection, and we should be as safe there as\r\nwe are every where else. I have no doubt of their attachment to us in\r\npreference of the English.\r\n\r\nI salute you with sincere friendship and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXII.--TO LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR LINCOLN, November 13, 1808\r\n\r\n\r\nTO LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nWashington, November 13, 1808.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI enclose you a petition from Nantucket, and refer it for your decision.\r\nOur opinion here is, that that place has been so deeply concerned in\r\nsmuggling, that if it wants, it is because it has illegally sent away\r\nwhat it ought to have retained for its own consumption. Be so good as to\r\nbear in mind that I have asked the favor of you to see that your State\r\nencounters no real want, while, at the same time, where applications are\r\nmade merely to cover fraud, no facilities towards that be furnished. I\r\npresume there can be no want in Massachusetts, as yet, as I am informed\r\nthat Governor Sullivan’s permits are openly bought and sold here and\r\nin Alexandria, and at other markets. The Congressional campaign is just\r\nopening: three alternatives alone are to be chosen from. 1. Embargo. 2.\r\nWar. 3. Submission and tribute. And, wonderful to tell, the last will\r\nnot want advocates. The real question, however, will lie between the two\r\nfirst, on which there is considerable division. As yet the first seems\r\nmost to prevail; but opinions are by no means yet settled down. Perhaps\r\nthe advocates of the second may, to a formal declaration of war, prefer\r\ngeneral letters of mark and reprisal, because, on a repeal of their\r\nedicts by the belligerent, a revocation of the letters of mark restores\r\npeace without the delay, difficulties, and ceremonies of a treaty. On\r\nthis occasion, I think it fair to leave to those who are to act on them,\r\nthe decisions they prefer, being to be myself but a spectator. I should\r\nnot feel justified in directing measures which those who are to execute\r\nthem would disapprove. Our situation is truly difficult. We have been\r\npressed by the belligerents to the very wall, and all further retreat is\r\nimpracticable. I salute you with sincere friendship.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXIII.--TO THOMAS JEFFERSON RANDOLPH, November 24, 1808\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS JEFFERSON RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\nWashington, November 24, 1808.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Jefferson,\r\n\r\nYour situation, thrown at such a distance from us and alone, cannot but\r\ngive us all great anxieties for you. As much has been secured for you,\r\nby your particular position and the acquaintance to which you have been\r\nrecommended, as could be done towards shielding you from the dangers\r\nwhich surround you. But thrown on a wide world, among entire strangers,\r\nwithout a friend or guardian to advise, so young, too, and with so\r\nlittle experience of mankind, your dangers are great, and still your\r\nsafety must rest on yourself. A determination never to do what is\r\nwrong, prudence, and good humor, will go far towards securing to you the\r\nestimation of the world. When I recollect that at fourteen years of age,\r\nthe whole care and direction of myself was thrown on myself entirely,\r\nwithout a relation or friend qualified to advise or guide me, and\r\nrecollect the various sorts of bad company with which I associated from\r\ntime to time, I am astonished I did not turn off with some of them, and\r\nbecome as worthless to society as they were. I had the good fortune to\r\nbecome acquainted very early with some characters of very high standing,\r\nand to feel the incessant wish that I could ever become what they were.\r\nUnder temptations and difficulties, I would ask myself what would Dr.\r\nSmall, Mr. Wythe, Peyton Randolph do in this situation? What course\r\nin it will insure me their approbation? I am certain that this mode\r\nof deciding on my conduct, tended more to its correctness than any\r\nreasoning powers I possessed. Knowing the even and dignified line they\r\npursued, I could never doubt for a moment which of two courses would\r\nbe in character for them. Whereas, seeking the same object through\r\na process of moral reasoning, and with the jaundiced eye of youth, I\r\nshould often have erred. From the circumstances of my position, I\r\nwas often thrown into the society of horse-racers, card-players,\r\nfox-hunters, scientific and professional men, and of dignified men; and\r\nmany a time have I asked myself, in the enthusiastic moment of the\r\ndeath of a fox, the victory of a favorite horse, the issue of a question\r\neloquently argued at the bar, or in the great council of the nation,\r\nwell, which of these kinds of reputation should I prefer? That of a\r\nhorse-jockey? a fox-hunter? an orator? or the honest advocate of my\r\ncountry’s rights? Be assured, my dear Jefferson, that these little\r\nreturns into ourselves, this self-catechizing habit, is not trifling,\r\nnor useless, but leads to the prudent selection and steady pursuit of\r\nwhat is right.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned good humor as one of the preservatives of our peace and\r\ntranquillity. It is among the most effectual, and its effect is so well\r\nimitated and aided, artificially, by politeness, that this also becomes\r\nan acquisition of first-rate value. In truth, politeness is artificial\r\ngood humor, it covers the natural want of it, and ends by rendering\r\nhabitual a substitute nearly equivalent to the real virtue. It is the\r\npractice of sacrificing to those whom we meet in society, all the little\r\nconveniences and preferences which will gratify them, and deprive us of\r\nnothing worth a moment’s consideration; it is the giving a pleasing and\r\nflattering turn to our expressions, which will conciliate others, and\r\nmake them pleased with us as well as themselves. How cheap a price for\r\nthe good will of another! When this is in return for a rude thing said\r\nby another, it brings him to his senses, it mortifies and corrects\r\nhim in the most salutary way, and places him at the feet of your good\r\nnature, in the eyes of the company. But in stating prudential rules for\r\nour government in society I must not omit the important one of never\r\nentering into dispute or argument with another. I never yet saw an\r\ninstance of one of two disputants convincing the other by argument. I\r\nhave seen many, of their getting warm, becoming rude, and shooting one\r\nanother. Conviction is the effect of our own dispassionate reasoning,\r\neither in solitude, or weighing within ourselves, dispassionately, what\r\nwe hear from others, standing uncommitted in argument ourselves. It was\r\none of the rules, which, above all others, made Doctor Franklin the most\r\namiable of men in society, ‘never to contradict any body.’ If he was\r\nurged to announce an opinion, he did it rather by asking questions, as\r\nif for information, or by suggesting doubts. When I hear another express\r\nan opinion which is not mine, I say to myself, he has a right to his\r\nopinion, as I to mine; why should I question it? His error does me no\r\ninjury, and shall I become a Don Quixote, to bring all men by force of\r\nargument to one opinion? If a fact be misstated, it is probable he is\r\ngratified by a belief of it, and I have no right to deprive him of the\r\ngratification. If he wants information, he will ask it, and then I will\r\ngive it in measured terms; but if he still believes his own story, and\r\nshows a desire to dispute the fact with me, I hear him, and say nothing.\r\nIt is his affair, not mine, if he prefers error. There are two classes\r\nof disputants most frequently to be met with among us. The first is of\r\nyoung students, just entered the threshold of science, with a first view\r\nof its outlines, not yet filled up with the details and modifications\r\nwhich a further progress would bring to their knowledge. The other\r\nconsists of the ill-tempered and rude men in society, who have taken up\r\na passion for politics. (Good humor and politeness never introduce\r\ninto mixed society a question on which they foresee there will be a\r\ndifference of opinion.) From both of those classes of disputants, my\r\ndear Jefferson, keep aloof, as you would from the infected subjects of\r\nyellow fever or pestilence. Consider yourself, when with them, as among\r\nthe patients of Bedlam, needing medical more than moral counsel. Be\r\na listener only, keep within yourself, and endeavor to establish with\r\nyourself the habit of silence, especially on politics. In the fevered\r\nstate of our country, no good can ever result from any attempt to set\r\none of these fiery zealots to rights, either in fact or principle. They\r\nare determined as to the facts they will believe, and the opinions on\r\nwhich they will act. Get by them, therefore, as you would by an angry\r\nbull: it is not for a man of sense to dispute the road with such an\r\nanimal. You will be more exposed than others to have these animals\r\nshaking their horns at you, because of the relation in which you stand\r\nwith me. Full of political venom, and willing to see me and to hate me\r\nas a chief in the antagonist party, your presence will be to them what\r\nthe vomit-grass is to the sick dog, a nostrum for producing ejaculation.\r\nLook upon them exactly with that eye, and pity them as objects to whom\r\nyou can administer only occasional ease. My character is not within\r\ntheir power. It is in the hands of my fellow-citizens at large, and will\r\nbe consigned to honor or infamy by the verdict of the republican mass of\r\nour country, according to what themselves will have seen, not what\r\ntheir enemies and mine shall have said. Never, therefore, consider these\r\npuppies in politics as requiring any notice from you, and always show,\r\nthat you are not afraid to leave my character to the umpirage of\r\npublic opinion. Look steadily to the pursuits which have carried you\r\nto Philadelphia, be very select in the society you attach yourself\r\nto, avoid taverns, drinkers, smokers, idlers, and dissipated persons\r\ngenerally; for it is with such that broils and contentions arise; and\r\nyou will find your path more easy and tranquil. The limits of my paper\r\nwarn me that it is time for me to close with my affectionate adieu.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\nP. S. Present me affectionately to Mr. Ogilvie, and in doing the same to\r\nMr. Peale, tell him I am writing with his polygraph, and shall send him\r\nmine the first moment I have leisure enough to pack it. T. J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXIV.--TO DOCTOR EUSTIS, January 14, 1809\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR EUSTIS.\r\n\r\nWashington, January 14, 1809.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have the pleasure to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of\r\nDecember the 24th, and of the resolutions of the republican citizens\r\nof Boston, of the 19th of that month. These are worthy of the ancient\r\ncharacter of the sons of Massachusetts, and of the spirit of concord\r\nwith her sister States, which, and which alone, carried us successfully\r\nthrough the revolutionary war, and finally placed us under that national\r\ngovernment, which constitutes the safety of every part, by uniting for\r\nits protection the powers of the whole. The moment for exerting these\r\nunited powers, to repel the injuries of the belligerents of Europe,\r\nseems likely to be pressed upon us. They have interdicted our commerce\r\nwith nearly the whole world. They have declared it shall be carried on\r\nwith such places, in such articles, and in such measure only, as they\r\nshall dictate; thus prostrating all the principles of right, which\r\nhave hitherto protected it. After exhausting the cup of forbearance\r\nand conciliation to its dregs, we found it necessary, on behalf of that\r\ncommerce, to take time to call it home into a state of safety, to put\r\nthe towns and harbors which carry it on into a condition of defence, and\r\nto make further preparation for enforcing the redress of its wrongs, and\r\nrestoring it to its rightful freedom. This required a certain measure of\r\ntime, which, although not admitting specific limitation, must, from its\r\navowed objects, have been obvious to all: and the progress actually made\r\ntowards the accomplishment of these objects, proves it now to be near\r\nits term.\r\n\r\nWhile thus endeavoring to secure, and preparing to vindicate that\r\ncommerce, the absurd opinion has been propagated, that this temporary\r\nand necessary arrangement was to be a permanent system, and was intended\r\nfor its destruction. The sentiments expressed in the paper you were so\r\nkind as to enclose me, show that those who have concurred in them, have\r\njudged with more candor the intentions of their government, and\r\nare sufficiently aware of the tendency of the excitements and\r\nmisrepresentations which have been practised on this occasion. And such,\r\nI am persuaded, will be the disposition of the citizens of Massachusetts\r\nat large, whenever truth can reach them. Associated with her sister\r\nStates in a common government, the fundamental principle of which is,\r\nthat the will of the majority is to prevail, sensible, that in the\r\npresent difficulty, that will has been governed by no local interests\r\nor jealousies, that to save permanent rights, temporary sacrifices\r\nwere necessary, that these have fallen as impartially on all, as in a\r\nsituation so peculiar they could be made to do, she will see, in the\r\nexisting measures, a legitimate and honest exercise of the will and\r\nwisdom of the whole. And her citizens, faithful to themselves and\r\ntheir associates, will not, to avoid a transient pressure, yield to the\r\nseductions of enemies to their independence, foreign or domestic, and\r\ntake a course equally subversive of their well-being, as of that of\r\ntheir brethren.\r\n\r\nThe approbation expressed by the republican citizens of the town of\r\nBoston, of the course pursued by the national government, is truly\r\nconsoling to its members: and, encouraged by the declaration of the\r\ncontinuance of their confidence, and by the assurance of their support,\r\nthey will continue to pursue the line of their high duties according\r\nto the best of their understandings, and with undeviating regard to\r\nthe good of the whole. Permit me to avail myself of this occasion of\r\ntendering you personally the assurances of my great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXV.--TO COLONEL MONROE, January 28, 1809\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\nWashington, January 28, 1809.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of the 18th was received in due time, and the answer has been\r\ndelayed as well by a pressure of business, as by the expectation of your\r\nabsence from Richmond.\r\n\r\nThe idea of sending a special mission to France or England is not\r\nentertained at all here. After so little attention to us from the\r\nformer, and so insulting an answer from Canning, such a mark of respect\r\nas an extraordinary mission, would be a degradation against which all\r\nminds revolt here. The idea was hazarded in the House of Representatives\r\na few days ago, by a member, and an approbation expressed by another,\r\nbut rejected indignantly by every other person who spoke, and very\r\ngenerally in conversation by all others: and I am satisfied such a\r\nproposition would get no vote in the Senate. The course the legislature\r\nmeans to pursue, may be inferred from the act now passed for a meeting\r\nin May, and a proposition before them for repealing the embargo in June,\r\nand then resuming and maintaining by force our right of navigation.\r\nThere will be considerable opposition to this last proposition, not\r\nonly from the federalists, old and new, who oppose every thing, but from\r\nsound members of the majority. Yet it is believed it will obtain a good\r\nmajority, and that it is the only proposition which can be devised\r\nthat could obtain a majority of any kind. Final propositions, will,\r\ntherefore, be soon despatched to both the belligerents through the\r\nresident ministers, so that their answers will be received before the\r\nmeeting in May, and will decide what is to be done. This last trial for\r\npeace is not thought desperate. If, as is expected, Bonaparte should\r\nbe successful in Spain, however every virtuous and liberal sentiment\r\nrevolts at it, it may induce both powers to be more accommodating\r\nwith us. England will see here the only asylum for her commerce\r\nand manufactures, worth more to her than her orders of council. And\r\nBonaparte, having Spain at his feet, will look immediately to the\r\nSpanish colonies, and think our neutrality cheaply purchased by a repeal\r\nof the illegal parts of his decrees, with perhaps the Floridas thrown\r\ninto the bargain. Should a change in the aspect of affairs in Europe\r\nproduce this disposition in both powers, our peace and prosperity may\r\nbe revived and long continue. Otherwise, we must again take the tented\r\nfield, as we did in 1776 under more inauspicious circumstances.\r\n\r\nThere never has been a situation of the world before, in which such\r\nendeavors as we have made would not have secured our peace. It is\r\nprobable there never will be such another. If we go to war now, I fear\r\nwe may renounce for ever the hope of seeing an end of our national debt.\r\nIf we can keep at peace eight years longer, our income, liberated from\r\ndebt, will be adequate to any war, without new taxes or loans, and our\r\nposition and increasing strength will put us _hors d’insulte_ from any\r\nnation. I am now so near the moment of retiring, that I take no part in\r\naffairs beyond the expression of an opinion. I think it fair, that\r\nmy successor should now originate those measures of which he will be\r\ncharged with the execution and responsibility, and that it is my duty to\r\nclothe them with the forms of authority. Five weeks more will relieve me\r\nfrom a drudgery to which I am no longer equal, and restore me to a scene\r\nof tranquillity, amidst my family and friends, more congenial to my\r\nage and natural inclinations. In that situation, it will always be a\r\npleasure to me to see you, and to repeat to you the assurances of my\r\nconstant friendship and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXVI.--TO THOMAS MANN RANDOLPH, February 7, 1809\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS MANN RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\nWashington, February 7, 1809.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI thought Congress had taken their ground firmly for continuing\r\ntheir embargo till June, and then war. But a sudden and unaccountable\r\nrevolution of opinion took place the last week, chiefly among the New\r\nEngland and New York members, and in a kind of panic, they voted the 4th\r\nof March for removing the embargo, and by such a majority as gave\r\nall reason to believe, they would not agree either to war or\r\nnon-intercourse. This, too, was after we had become satisfied, that\r\nthe Essex Junto had found their expectation desperate, of inducing the\r\npeople there to either separation or forcible opposition. The majority\r\nof Congress, however, has now rallied to the removing the embargo on the\r\n4th of March, non-intercourse with France and Great Britain, trade every\r\nwhere else, and continuing war preparations. The further details are not\r\nyet settled, but I believe it is perfectly certain that the embargo\r\nwill be taken off the 4th of March. Present my warmest affections to my\r\ndearest Martha, and the young ones, and accept the assurances of them to\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXVII.--TO JOHN HOLLINS, February 19, 1809\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN HOLLINS.\r\n\r\nWashington, February 19, 1809.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nA little transaction of mine, as innocent an one as I ever entered into,\r\nand where an improper construction was never less expected, is making\r\nsome noise, I observe, in your city. I beg leave to explain it to you,\r\nbecause I mean to ask your agency in it. The last year, the Agricultural\r\nSociety of Paris, of which I am a member, having had a plough presented\r\nto them, which, on trial with a graduated instrument, did equal work\r\nwith half the force of their best ploughs, they thought it would be a\r\nbenefit to mankind to communicate it. They accordingly sent one to me,\r\nwith a view to its being made known here, and they sent one to the Duke\r\nof Bedford also, who is one of their members, to be made use of for\r\nEngland, although the two nations were then at war. By the Mentor, now\r\ngoing to France, I have given permission to two individuals in Delaware\r\nand New York, to import two parcels of Merino sheep from France, which\r\nthey have procured there, and to some gentlemen in Boston, to import a\r\nvery valuable machine which spins cotton, wool, and flax equally. The\r\nlast spring, the Society informed me they were cultivating the cotton of\r\nthe Levant and other parts of the Mediterranean, and wished to try also\r\nthat of our southern States. I immediately got a friend to have two\r\ntierces of seed forwarded to me. They were consigned to Messrs. Falls\r\nand Brown of Baltimore, and notice of it being given me, I immediately\r\nwrote to them to re-ship them to New York, to be sent by the Mentor.\r\nTheir first object was to make a show of my letter, as something very\r\ncriminal, and to carry the subject into the newspapers. I had, on a like\r\nrequest, some time ago (but before the embargo), from the President of\r\nthe Board of Agriculture of London, of which I am also a member, to send\r\nthem some of the genuine May wheat of Virginia, forwarded to them two or\r\nthree barrels of it. General Washington, in his time, received from the\r\nsame Society the seed of the perennial succory, which Arthur Young had\r\ncarried over from France to England, and I have since received from a\r\nmember of it the seed of the famous turnip of Sweden, now so well known\r\nhere. I mention these things, to show the nature of the correspondence\r\nwhich is carried on between societies instituted for the benevolent\r\npurpose of communicating to all parts of the world whatever useful is\r\ndiscovered in any one of them. These societies are always in peace,\r\nhowever their nations may be at war. Like the republic of letters,\r\nthey form a great fraternity spreading over the whole earth, and their\r\ncorrespondence is never interrupted by any civilized nation. Vaccination\r\nhas been a late and remarkable instance of the liberal diffusion of a\r\nblessing newly discovered. It is really painful, it is mortifying, to be\r\nobliged to note these things, which are known to every one who knows any\r\nthing, and felt with approbation by every one who has any feeling. But\r\nwe have a faction to whose hostile passions the torture even of right\r\ninto wrong is a delicious gratification. Their malice I have long\r\nlearned to disregard, their censure to deem praise. But I observe,\r\nthat some republicans are not satisfied (even while we are receiving\r\nliberally from others) that this small return should be made. They will\r\nthink more justly at another day: but, in the mean time, I wish to avoid\r\noffence. My prayer to you, therefore, is, that you will be so good,\r\nunder the enclosed order, as to receive these two tierces of seed from\r\nFalls and Brown, and pay them their disbursements for freight, &c. which\r\nI will immediately remit you on knowing the amount. Of the seed, when\r\nreceived, be so good as to make manure for your garden. When rotted with\r\na due mixture of stable manure or earth, it is the best in the world.\r\nI rely on your friendship to excuse this trouble, it being necessary I\r\nshould not commit myself again to persons of whose honor, or the want of\r\nit, I know nothing.\r\n\r\nAccept the assurances of my constant esteem and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXVIII.--TO M. DUPONT DE NEMOURS, March 2, 1809\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DUPONT DE NEMOURS.\r\n\r\nWashington, March 2, 1809.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMy last to you was of May the 2nd; since which I have received yours of\r\nMay the 25th, June the 1st, July the 23rd, 24th, and September the 5th,\r\nand distributed the two pamphlets according to your desire. They are\r\nread with the delight which every thing from your pen gives.\r\n\r\nAfter using every effort which could prevent or delay our being\r\nentangled in the war of Europe, that seems now our only resource. The\r\nedicts of the two belligerents, forbidding us to be seen on the ocean,\r\nwe met by an embargo. This gave us time to call home our seamen, ships,\r\nand property, to levy men and put our sea-ports into a certain state\r\nof defence. We have now taken off the embargo, except as to France\r\nand England and their territories, because fifty millions of exports\r\nannually sacrificed, are the treble of what war would cost us; besides,\r\nthat by war we should take something, and lose less than at present. But\r\nto give you a true description of the state of things here, I must\r\nrefer you to Mr. Coles, the bearer of this, my secretary, a most worthy,\r\nintelligent, and well-informed young man, whom I recommend to your\r\nnotice, and conversation on our affairs. His discretion and fidelity\r\nmay be relied on. I expect he will find you with Spain at your feet,\r\nbut England still afloat, and a barrier to the Spanish colonies. But all\r\nthese concerns I am now leaving to be settled by my friend Mr. Madison.\r\nWithin a few days I retire to my family, my books, and farms; and having\r\ngained the harbor myself, I shall look on my friends still buffeting\r\nthe storm, with anxiety indeed, but not with envy. Never did a prisoner,\r\nreleased from his chains, feel such relief as I shall on shaking off\r\nthe shackles of power. Nature intended me for the tranquil pursuits of\r\nscience, by rendering them my supreme delight. But the enormities of the\r\ntimes in which I have lived, have forced me to take a part in resisting\r\nthem, and to commit myself on the boisterous ocean of political\r\npassions. I thank God for the opportunity of retiring from them without\r\ncensure, and carrying with me the most consoling proofs of public\r\napprobation. I leave every thing in the hands of men so able to take\r\ncare of them, that if we are destined to meet misfortunes, it will\r\nbe because no human wisdom could avert them. Should you return to the\r\nUnited States, perhaps your curiosity may lead you to visit the hermit\r\nof Monticello. He will receive you with affection and delight; hailing\r\nyou in the mean time with his affectionate salutations, and assurances\r\nof constant esteem and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\nP. S. If you return to us, bring a couple of pair of true-bred\r\nshepherd’s dogs. You will add a valuable possession to a country now\r\nbeginning to pay great attention to the raising sheep.\r\n\r\nT.J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXIX.--TO THE PRESIDENT, March 17, 1809\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nMonticello, March 17, 1809.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nOn opening my letters from France, in the moment of my departure from\r\nWashington, I found from their signatures that they were from literary\r\ncharacters, except one from Mr. Short, which mentioned in the outset\r\nthat it was private, and that his public communications were in the\r\nletter to the Secretary of State, which I sent you. I find, however, on\r\nreading his letter to me (which I did not do till I got home) a passage\r\nof some length, proper to be communicated to you, and which I have\r\ntherefore extracted.\r\n\r\nI had a very fatiguing journey, having found the roads excessively bad,\r\nalthough I have seen them worse. The last three days I found it better\r\nto be on horseback, and travelled eight hours through as disagreeable\r\na snow storm as I was ever in. Feeling no inconvenience from the\r\nexpedition but fatigue, I have more confidence in my _vis vitæ_ than I\r\nhad before entertained. The spring is remarkably backward. No oats\r\nsown, not much tobacco seed, and little done in the gardens. Wheat has\r\nsuffered considerably. No vegetation visible yet but the red maple,\r\nweeping-willow, and lilac. Flour is said to be at eight dollars at\r\nRichmond, and all produce is hurrying down.\r\n\r\nI feel great anxiety for the occurrences of the ensuing four or five\r\nmonths. If peace can be preserved, I hope and trust you will have\r\na smooth administration. I know no government which would be so\r\nembarrassing in war as ours. This would proceed very much from the\r\nlying and licentious character of our papers; but much, also, from the\r\nwonderful credulity of the members of Congress in the floating lies of\r\nthe day. And in this no experience seems to correct them. I have never\r\nseen a Congress during the last eight years, a great majority of which\r\nI would not implicitly have relied on in any question, could their minds\r\nhave been purged of all errors of fact. The evil, too, increases greatly\r\nwith the protraction of the session, and I apprehend, in case of war,\r\ntheir session would have a tendency to become permanent. It is much,\r\ntherefore, to be desired that war may be avoided, if circumstances will\r\nadmit. Nor in the present maniac state of Europe, should I estimate\r\nthe point of honor by the ordinary scale. I believe we shall, on the\r\ncontrary, have credit with the world, for having made the avoidance\r\nof being engaged in the present unexampled war, our first object. War,\r\nhowever, may become a less losing business than unresisted depredation.\r\nWith every wish that events may be propitious to your administration, I\r\nsalute you with sincere affection and every sympathy of the heart.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXX.--TO THE INHABITANTS OF ALBEMARLE COUNTY, April 3, 1809\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE INHABITANTS OF ALBEMARLE COUNTY, IN VIRGINIA,\r\n\r\nReturning to the scenes of my birth and early life, to the society\r\nof those with whom I was raised, and who have been ever dear to me, I\r\nreceive, fellow-citizens and neighbors, with inexpressible pleasure,\r\nthe cordial welcome you are so good as to give me. Long absent on duties\r\nwhich the history of a wonderful era made incumbent on those called to\r\nthem, the pomp, the turmoil, the bustle, and splendor of office, have\r\ndrawn but deeper sighs for the tranquil and irresponsible occupations of\r\nprivate life, for the enjoyment of an affectionate intercourse with\r\nyou, my neighbors and friends, and the endearments of family love, which\r\nnature has given us all, as the sweetener of every hour. For these I\r\ngladly lay down the distressing burthen of power, and seek, with my\r\nfellow-citizens, repose and safety under the watchful cares, the labors,\r\nand perplexities of younger and abler minds. The anxieties you express\r\nto administer to my happiness, do, of themselves, confer that happiness;\r\nand the measure will be complete, if my endeavors to fulfil my duties in\r\nthe several public stations to which I have been called, have obtained\r\nfor me the approbation of my country. The part which I have acted on the\r\ntheatre of public life, has been before them; and to their sentence I\r\nsubmit it: but the testimony of my native county, of the individuals who\r\nhave known me in private life, to my conduct in its various duties and\r\nrelations, is the more grateful, as proceeding from eye-witnesses and\r\nobservers, from triers of the vicinage. Of you, then, my neighbors, I\r\nmay ask, in the face of the world, ‘Whose ox have I taken, or whom have\r\nI defrauded? Whom have I oppressed, or of whose hand have I received\r\na bribe to blind mine eyes therewith?’ On your verdict I rest with\r\nconscious security. Your wishes for my happiness are received with\r\njust sensibility, and I offer sincere prayers for your own welfare and\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\nApril 3, 1809.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXI.--TO WILSON C. NICHOLAS, June 13, 1809\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILSON C. NICHOLAS.\r\n\r\nMonticello, June 13, 1809.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI did not know till Mr. Patterson called on us, a few days ago, that you\r\nhad passed on to Washington. I had recently observed in the debates of\r\nCongress, a matter introduced, on which I wished to give explanations\r\nmore fully in conversation, which I will now do by abridgment in\r\nwriting. Mr. Randolph has proposed an inquiry into certain prosecutions\r\nat common law in Connecticut, for libels on the government, and not only\r\nhimself, but others have stated them with such affected caution, and\r\nsuch hints at the same time, as to leave on every mind the impression\r\nthat they had been instituted either by my direction, or with my\r\nacquiescence, at least. This has not been denied by my friends, because\r\nprobably the fact is unknown to them. I shall state it for their\r\nsatisfaction, and leave it to be disposed of as they think best.\r\n\r\nI had observed in a newspaper (some years ago, I do not recollect the\r\ntime exactly), some dark hints of a prosecution in Connecticut, but so\r\nobscurely hinted, that I paid little attention to it. Some considerable\r\ntime after, it was again mentioned, so that I understood that some\r\nprosecution was going on in the federal court there, for calumnies\r\nuttered from the pulpit against me by a clergyman. I immediately wrote\r\nto Mr. Granger, who, I think, was in Connecticut at the time, stating\r\nthat I had laid it down as a law to myself, to take no notice of the\r\nthousand calumnies issued against me, but to trust my character to my\r\nown conduct, and the good sense and candor of my fellow-citizens; that\r\nI had found no reason to be dissatisfied with that course, and I\r\nwas unwilling it should be broke through by others as to any matter\r\nconcerning me; and I therefore requested him to desire the district\r\nattorney to dismiss the prosecution. Some time after this, 1 heard of\r\nsubpoenas being served on General Lee, David M. Randolph, and others, as\r\nwitnesses to attend the trial. I then, for the first time, conjectured\r\nthe subject of the libel. I immediately wrote to Mr. Granger, to\r\nrequire an immediate dismission of the prosecution. The answer of Mr.\r\nHuntington, the district attorney, was, that these subpoenas had been\r\nissued by the defendant without his knowledge, that it had been his\r\nintention to dismiss all the prosecutions at the first meeting of the\r\ncourt, and to accompany it with an avowal of his opinion, that they\r\ncould not be maintained, because the federal court had no jurisdiction\r\nover libels. This was accordingly done. I did not till then know that\r\nthere were other prosecutions of the same nature, nor do I now know what\r\nwere their subjects. But all went off together; and I afterwards saw, in\r\nthe hands of Mr. Granger, a letter written by the clergyman, disavowing\r\nany personal ill will towards me, and solemnly declaring he had never\r\nuttered the words charged. I think Mr. Granger either showed me, or said\r\nthere were affidavits of at least half a dozen respectable men who were\r\npresent at the sermon, and swore no such expressions were uttered, and\r\nas many equally respectable who swore the contrary. But the clergyman\r\nexpressed his gratification at the dismission of the prosecution. I\r\nwrite all this from memory, and after too long an interval of time to be\r\ncertain of the exactness of all the details; but I am sure there is no\r\nvariation material, and Mr. Granger, correcting small lapses of\r\nmemory, can confirm every thing substantial. Certain it is, that the\r\nprosecutions had been instituted, and had made considerable progress,\r\nwithout my knowledge; that they were disapproved by me as soon as known,\r\nand directed to be discontinued. The attorney did it on the same ground\r\non which I had acted myself in the cases of Duane, Callender, and\r\nothers; to wit, that the sedition law was unconstitutional and null,\r\nand that my obligation to execute what was law, involved that of not\r\nsuffering rights secured by valid laws, to be prostrated by what was no\r\nlaw. I always understood that these prosecutions had been invited, if\r\nnot instituted, by Judge Edwards, and the marshal, being republican,\r\nhad summoned a grand jury partly or wholly republican: but that Mr.\r\nHuntington declared from the beginning against the jurisdiction of the\r\ncourt, and had determined to enter _nolle-prosequis_ before he received\r\nmy directions.\r\n\r\nI trouble you with another subject. The law making my letters post free,\r\ngoes to those to me only, not those from me. The bill had got to its\r\npassage before this was observed (and first I believe by Mr. Dana),\r\nand the house under too much pressure of business near the close of the\r\nsession to bring in another bill. As the privilege of freedom was given\r\nto the letters from as well as to both my predecessors, I suppose\r\nno reason exists for making a distinction. And in so extensive a\r\ncorrespondence as I am subject to, and still considerably on public\r\nmatters, it would be a sensible convenience to myself, as well as those\r\nwho have occasion to receive letters from me. It happens, too, as I was\r\ntold at the time (for I have never looked into it myself), that it was\r\ndone by two distinct acts on both the former occasions. Mr. Eppes, I\r\nthink, mentioned this to me. I know from the Post Master General, that\r\nMr. Adams franks all his letters. I state this matter to you as being my\r\nrepresentative, which must apologize for the trouble of it. We have been\r\nseasonable since you left us. Yesterday evening and this morning we have\r\nhad refreshing showers, which will close and confirm the business of\r\nplanting. Affectionately yours,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXII.--TO THE PRESIDENT, August 17, 1809\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nMonticello, August 17, 1809.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nI never doubted the chicanery of the Anglomen, on whatsoever measures\r\nyou should take in consequence of the disavowal of Erskine; yet I am\r\nsatisfied that both the proclamations have been sound. The first has\r\nbeen sanctioned by universal approbation; and although it was not\r\nliterally the case foreseen by the legislature, yet it was a proper\r\nextension of their provision to a case similar, though not the same.\r\nIt proved to the whole world our desire of accommodation, and must have\r\nsatisfied every candid federalist on that head. It was not only proper\r\non the well-grounded confidence that the arrangement would be honestly\r\nexecuted, but ought to have taken place even had the perfidy of England\r\nbeen foreseen. Their dirty gain is richly remunerated to us by our\r\nplacing them so shamefully in the wrong, and by the union it must\r\nproduce among ourselves. The last proclamation admits of quibbles, of\r\nwhich advantage will doubtless be endeavored to be taken, by those to\r\nwhom gain is their god, and their country nothing. But it is soundly\r\ndefensible. The British minister assured us, that the orders of council\r\nwould be revoked before the 10th of June. The executive, trusting in\r\nthat assurance, declared by proclamation that the revocation was to take\r\nplace, and that on that event the law was to be suspended. But the event\r\ndid not take place, and the consequence, of course, could not follow.\r\nThis view is derived from the former non-intercourse law only, having\r\nnever read the latter one. I had doubted whether Congress must not be\r\ncalled; but that arose from another doubt, whether their second law had\r\nnot changed the ground, so as to require their agency to give operation\r\nto the law. Should Bonaparte have the wisdom to correct his injustice\r\ntowards us, I consider war with England as inevitable. Our ships will\r\ngo to France and its dependencies, and they will take them. This will\r\nbe war on their part, and leaves no alternative but reprisal. I have no\r\ndoubt you will think it safe to act on this hypothesis, and with energy.\r\nThe moment that open war shall be apprehended from them, we should take\r\npossession of Baton Rouge. If we do not, they will, and New Orleans\r\nbecomes irrecoverable, and the western country blockaded during the war.\r\nIt would be justifiable towards Spain on this ground, and equally so on\r\nthat of title to West Florida, and reprisal extended to East Florida.\r\nWhatever turn our present difficulty may take, I look upon all cordial\r\nconciliation with England as desperate during the life of the present\r\nKing. I hope and doubt not that Erskine will justify himself. My\r\nconfidence is founded in a belief of his integrity, and in the ------\r\nof Canning. I consider the present as the most shameless ministry which\r\never disgraced England. Copenhagen will immortalize their infamy. In\r\ngeneral their administrations are so changeable, and they are obliged\r\nto descend to such tricks to keep themselves in place, that nothing like\r\nhonor or morality can ever be counted on in transactions with them. I\r\nsalute you with all possible affection.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXIII.--TO DOCTOR BARTON, September 21, 1809\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR BARTON.\r\n\r\nMonticello, September 21, 1809.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI received last night your favor of the 14th, and would with all\r\npossible pleasure have communicated to you any part or the whole of the\r\nIndian vocabularies which I had collected, but an irreparable misfortune\r\nhas deprived me of them. I have now been thirty years availing myself of\r\nevery possible opportunity of procuring Indian vocabularies to the same\r\nset of words: my opportunities were probably better than will ever occur\r\nagain to any person having the same desire. I had collected about fifty,\r\nand had digested most of them in collateral columns, and meant to have\r\nprinted them the last year of my stay in Washington. But not having yet\r\ndigested Captain Lewis’s collection, nor having leisure then to do it,\r\nI put it off till I should return home. The whole, as well digest as\r\noriginals, were packed in a trunk of stationery, and sent round by water\r\nwith about thirty other packages of my effects, from Washington, and\r\nwhile ascending James river, this package, on account of its weight and\r\npresumed precious contents, was singled out and stolen. The thief, being\r\ndisappointed on opening it, threw into the river all its contents, of\r\nwhich he thought he could make no use. Among these were the whole of the\r\nvocabularies. Some leaves floated ashore, and were found in the mud;\r\nbut these were very few, and so defaced by the mud and water, that no\r\ngeneral use can ever be made of them. On the receipt of your letter I\r\nturned to them, and was very happy to find, that the only morsel of\r\nan original vocabulary among them, was Captain Lewis’s of the Pani\r\nlanguage, of which you say you have not one word. I therefore enclose it\r\nto you as it is, and a little fragment of some other, which I see is in\r\nhis hand-writing, but no indication remains on it of what language it\r\nis. It is a specimen of the condition of the little which was recovered.\r\nI am the more concerned at this accident, as of the two hundred and\r\nfifty words of my vocabularies, and the one hundred and thirty words of\r\nthe great Russian vocabularies of the languages of the other quarters of\r\nthe globe, seventy-three were common to both, and would have furnished\r\nmaterials for a comparison, from which something might have resulted.\r\nAlthough I believe no general use can ever be made of the wrecks of my\r\nloss, yet I will ask the return of the Pani vocabulary when you are done\r\nwith it. Perhaps I may make another attempt to collect, although I am\r\ntoo old to expect to make much progress in it.\r\n\r\nI learn, with pleasure, your acquisition of the pamphlet on the\r\nastronomy of the ancient Mexicans. If it be ancient and genuine, or\r\nmodern and rational, it will be of real value. It is one of the most\r\ninteresting countries of our hemisphere, and merits every attention.\r\n\r\nI am thankful for your kind offer of sending the original Spanish for my\r\nperusal. But I think it a pity to trust it to the accidents of the post,\r\nand whenever you publish the translation, I shall be satisfied to read\r\nthat which shall be given by your translator, who is, I am sure, a\r\ngreater adept in the language than I am.\r\n\r\nAccept the assurances of my great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXIV.--TO DON VALENTINE DE FORONDA, October 4, 1809\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DON VALENTINE DE FORONDA.\r\n\r\nMonticello, October 4, 1809.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of August the 26th came to hand in the succeeding month, and\r\nhave now to thank you for the pamphlet it contained. I have read it with\r\npleasure, and find the constitution proposed would probably be as free\r\nas is consistent with hereditary institutions. It has one feature\r\nwhich I like much; that which provides that when the three co-ordinate\r\nbranches differ in their construction of the constitution, the opinion\r\nof two branches shall overrule the third. Our constitution has not\r\nsufficiently solved this difficulty.\r\n\r\nAmong the multitude of characters with which public office leads us to\r\nofficial intercourse, we cannot fail to observe many, whose personal\r\nworth marks them as objects of particular esteem, whom we would wish\r\nto select for our society in private life. I avail myself gladly of the\r\npresent occasion, of assuring you that I was peculiarly impressed with\r\nyour merit and talents, and that I have ever entertained for them a\r\nparticular respect. To those whose views are single and direct, it is a\r\ngreat comfort to have to do business with frank and honorable minds.\r\nAnd here give me leave to make an avowal, for which, in my present\r\nretirement, there can be no motive but a regard for truth.\r\nYour predecessor, soured on a question of etiquette against the\r\nadministration of this country, wished to impute wrong to them in all\r\ntheir actions, even where he did not believe it himself. In this spirit,\r\nhe wished it to be believed that we were in unjustifiable co-operation\r\nin Miranda’s expedition. I solemnly, and on my personal truth and honor,\r\ndeclare to you, that this was entirely without foundation, and that\r\nthere was neither co-operation nor connivance on our part. He informed\r\nus he was about to attempt the liberation of his native country from\r\nbondage, and intimated a hope of our aid, or connivance at least. He was\r\nat once informed, that, although we had great cause of complaint against\r\nSpain, and even of war, yet whenever we should think proper to act as\r\nher enemy, it should be openly and above board, and that our hostility\r\nshould never be exercised by such petty means. We had no suspicion that\r\nhe expected to engage men here, but merely to purchase military stores.\r\nAgainst this there was no law, nor consequently any authority for us to\r\ninterpose obstacles. On the other hand, we deemed it improper to\r\nbetray his voluntary communication to the agents of Spain. Although his\r\nmeasures were many days in preparation at New York, we never had the\r\nleast intimation or suspicion of his engaging men in his enterprise,\r\nuntil he was gone; and I presume the secrecy of his proceedings kept\r\nthem equally unknown to the Marquis Yrujo at Philadelphia, and\r\nthe Spanish Consul at New York, since neither of them gave us any\r\ninformation of the enlistment of men, until it was too late for any\r\nmeasures taken at Washington to prevent their departure. The officer\r\nin the Customs, who participated in this transaction with Miranda,\r\nwe immediately removed, and should have had him and others further\r\npunished, had it not been for the protection given them by private\r\ncitizens at New York, in opposition to the government, who, by their\r\nimpudent falsehoods and calumnies, were able to overbear the minds of\r\nthe jurors. Be assured, Sir, that no motive could induce me, at this\r\ntime, to make this declaration so gratuitously, were it not founded in\r\nsacred truth: and I will add further, that I never did, or countenanced,\r\nin public life, a single act inconsistent with the strictest good faith;\r\nhaving never believed there was one code of morality for a public, and\r\nanother for a private man.\r\n\r\nI receive, with great pleasure, the testimonies of personal esteem which\r\nbreathe through your letter; and I pray you to accept those equally\r\nsincere with which I now salute you.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXV.--TO ALBERT GALLATIN, October 11, 1809\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ALBERT GALLATIN.\r\n\r\nMonticello, October 11, 1809.\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI do not know whether the request of Monsieur Moussier, explained in the\r\nenclosed letter, is grantable or not. But my partialities in favor of\r\nwhatever may promote either the useful or liberal arts, induce me\r\nto place it under your consideration, to do in it whatever is right,\r\nneither more nor less. I would then ask you to favor me with three\r\nlines, in such form as I may forward him by way of answer.\r\n\r\nI have reflected much and painfully on the change of dispositions\r\nwhich has taken place among the members of the cabinet, since the new\r\narrangement, as you stated to me in the moment of our separation. It\r\nwould be, indeed, a great public calamity, were it to fix you in the\r\npurpose which you seemed to think possible. I consider the fortunes of\r\nour republic as depending, in an eminent degree, on the extinguishment\r\nof the public debt before we engage in any war: because, that done, we\r\nshall have revenue enough to improve our country in peace, and defend it\r\nin war, without recurring either to new taxes or loans. But if the debt\r\nshould once more be swelled to a formidable size, its entire discharge\r\nwill be despaired of, and we shall be committed to the English career of\r\ndebt, corruption, and rottenness, closing with revolution. The discharge\r\nof the debt, therefore, is vital to the destinies of our government, and\r\nit hangs on Mr. Madison and yourself alone. We shall never see another\r\nPresident and Secretary of the Treasury making all other objects\r\nsubordinate to this. Were either of you to be lost to the public, that\r\ngreat hope is lost. I had always cherished the idea that you would fix\r\non that object the measure of your fame, and of the gratitude which our\r\ncountry will owe you. Nor can I yield up this prospect to the secondary\r\nconsiderations which assail your tranquillity. For sure I am, they never\r\ncan produce any other serious effect. Your value is too justly estimated\r\nby our fellow-citizens at large, as well as their functionaries, to\r\nadmit any remissness in their support of you. My opinion always was,\r\nthat none of us ever occupied stronger ground in the esteem of Congress\r\nthan yourself, and I am satisfied there is no one who does not feel\r\nyour aid to be still as important for the future, as it has been for the\r\npast. You have nothing, therefore, to apprehend in the dispositions of\r\nCongress, and still less of the President, who, above all men, is the\r\nmost interested and affectionately disposed to support you. I hope,\r\nthen, you will abandon entirely the idea you expressed to me, and that\r\nyou will consider the eight years to come as essential to your political\r\ncareer. I should certainly consider any earlier day of your retirement,\r\nas the most inauspicious day our new government has ever seen. In\r\naddition to the common interest in this question, I feel particularly\r\nfor myself the considerations of gratitude which I personally owe you\r\nfor your valuable aid during my administration of the public affairs,\r\na just sense of the large portion of the public approbation which was\r\nearned by your labors, and belongs to you, and the sincere friendship\r\nand attachment which grew out of our joint exertions to promote the\r\ncommon good; and of which I pray you now to accept the most cordial and\r\nrespectful assurances.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXVI.--TO CÆSAR A. RODNEY, February 10, 1810\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CÆSAR A. RODNEY.\r\n\r\nMonticello, February 10, 1810.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have to thank you for your favor of the 31st ultimo, which is just now\r\nreceived. It has been peculiarly unfortunate for us, personally, that\r\nthe portion in the history of mankind, at which we were called to take a\r\nshare in the direction of their affairs, was such an one as history has\r\nnever before presented. At any other period, the even-handed justice\r\nwe have observed towards all nations, the efforts we have made to merit\r\ntheir esteem by every act which candor or liberality could exercise,\r\nwould have preserved our peace, and secured the unqualified confidence\r\nof all other nations in our faith and probity. But the hurricane which\r\nis now blasting the world, physical and moral, has prostrated all the\r\nmounds of reason as well as right. All those calculations which, at any\r\nother period, would have been deemed honorable, of the existence of a\r\nmoral sense in man, individually or associated, of the connection\r\nwhich the laws of nature have established between his duties and his\r\ninterests, of a regard for honest fame and the esteem of our follow-men,\r\nhave been a matter of reproach on us, as evidences of imbecility. As if\r\nit could be a folly for an honest man to suppose that others could be\r\nhonest also, when it is their interest to be so. And when is this state\r\nof things to end? The death of Bonaparte would, to be sure, remove the\r\nfirst and chiefest apostle of the desolation of men and morals, and\r\nmight withdraw the scourge of the land. But what is to restore order\r\nand safety on the ocean? The death of George III? Not at all. He is only\r\nstupid; and his ministers, however weak and profligate in morals, are\r\nephemeral. But his nation is permanent, and it is that which is the\r\ntyrant of the ocean. The principle that force is right, is become\r\nthe principle of the nation itself. They would not permit an honest\r\nminister, were accident to bring such an one into power, to relax their\r\nsystem of lawless piracy. These were the difficulties when I was with\r\nyou. I know they are not lessened, and I pity you.\r\n\r\nIt is a blessing, however, that our people are reasonable; that they are\r\nkept so well informed of the state of things as to judge for themselves,\r\nto see the true sources of their difficulties, and to maintain\r\ntheir confidence undiminished in the wisdom and integrity of their\r\nfunctionaries. _Macte virtute_ therefore. Continue to go straight\r\nforward, pursuing always that which is right, as the only clue which can\r\nlead us out of the labyrinth. Let nothing be spared of either reason or\r\npassion, to preserve the public confidence entire, as the only rock\r\nof our safety. In times of peace the people look most to their\r\nrepresentatives; but in war, to the executive solely. It is visible that\r\ntheir confidence is even now veering in that direction; that they are\r\nlooking to the executive to give the proper direction to their affairs,\r\nwith a confidence as auspicious as it is well founded.\r\n\r\nI avail myself of this, the first occasion of writing to you, to express\r\nall the depth of my affection for you; the sense I entertain of your\r\nfaithful co-operation in my late labors, and the debt I owe for\r\nthe valuable aids I received from you. Though separated from my\r\nfellow-laborers in place and pursuit, my affections are with you all,\r\nand I offer daily prayers that ye love one another, as I love you. God\r\nbless you.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXVII.*--TO SAMUEL KERCHEVAL, February 19,1810\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL KERCHEVAL.\r\n\r\nMonticello, February 19,1810.\r\n\r\n     [* This letter is endorsed, ‘not sent.’]\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nYours of the 7th instant has been duly received, with the pamphlet\r\nenclosed, for which I return you my thanks. Nothing can be more exactly\r\nand seriously true than what is there stated; that but a short time\r\nelapsed after the death of the great reformer of the Jewish religion,\r\nbefore his principles were departed from by those who professed to\r\nbe his special servants, and perverted into an engine for enslaving\r\nmankind, and aggrandizing their oppressors in Church and State; that\r\nthe purest system of morals ever before preached to man, has been\r\nadulterated and sophisticated by artificial constructions, into a mere\r\ncontrivance to filch wealth and power to themselves; that rational men\r\nnot being able to swallow their impious heresies, in order to force\r\nthem down their throats, they raise the hue and cry of infidelity, while\r\nthemselves are the greatest obstacles to the advancement of the real\r\ndoctrines of Jesus, and do in fact constitute the real Anti-Christ.\r\n\r\nYou expect that your book will have some effect on the prejudices\r\nwhich the society of Friends entertain against the present and late\r\nadministrations. In this I think you will be disappointed. The Friends\r\nare men, formed with the same passions, and swayed by the same natural\r\nprinciples and prejudices as others. In cases where the passions are\r\nneutral, men will display their respect for the religious professions of\r\ntheir sect. But where their passions are enlisted, these professions\r\nare no obstacle. You observe very truly, that both the late and present\r\nadministration conducted the government on principles professed by the\r\nFriends. Our efforts to preserve peace, our measures as to the Indians,\r\nas to slavery, as to religious freedom, were all in consonance with\r\ntheir professions. Yet I never expected we should get a vote from them,\r\nand in this I was neither deceived nor disappointed. There is no riddle\r\nin this, to those who do not suffer themselves to be duped by the\r\nprofessions of religious sectaries. The theory of American Quakerism is\r\na very obvious one. The mother society is in England. Its members are\r\nEnglish by birth and residence, devoted to their own country, as good\r\ncitizens ought to be. The Quakers of these States are colonies or\r\nfiliations from the mother society, to whom that society sends its\r\nyearly lessons. On these the filiated societies model their opinions,\r\ntheir conduct, their passions, and attachments. A Quaker is, essentially\r\nan Englishman, in whatever part of the earth he is born or lives. The\r\noutrages of Great Britain on our navigation and commerce have kept us in\r\nperpetual bickerings with her. The Quakers here have taken side against\r\ntheir own government; not on their profession of peace, for they saw\r\nthat peace was our object also; but from devotion to the views of the\r\nmother society. In 1797 and 8, when an administration sought war with\r\nFrance, the Quakers were the most clamorous for war. Their principle of\r\npeace, as a secondary one, yielded to the primary one of adherence to\r\nthe Friends in England, and what was patriotism in the original became\r\ntreason in the copy. On that occasion, they obliged their good old\r\nleader, Mr. Pemberton, to erase his name from a petition to Congress,\r\nagainst war, which had been delivered to a Representative of\r\nPennsylvania, a member of the late and present administration. He\r\naccordingly permitted the old gentleman to erase his name. You must\r\nnot, therefore, expect that your book will have any more effect on the\r\nsociety of Friends here, than on the English merchants settled among\r\nus. I apply this to the Friends in general, not universally. I know\r\nindividuals among them as good patriots as we have.\r\n\r\nI thank you for the kind wishes and sentiments towards myself, expressed\r\nin your letter, and sincerely wish to yourself the blessings of health\r\nand happiness.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXVIII.--TO GENERAL KOSCIUSKO, February 26, 1810\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL KOSCIUSKO.\r\n\r\nMonticello, February 26, 1810.\r\n\r\nMy Dear General and Friend,\r\n\r\nI have rarely written to you; never but by safe conveyances; and\r\navoiding every thing political, lest coming from one in the station I\r\nthen held, it might be imputed injuriously to our country, or perhaps\r\neven excite jealousy of you. Hence my letters were necessarily dry.\r\nRetired now from public concerns, totally unconnected with them, and\r\navoiding all curiosity about what is done or intended, what I say is\r\nfrom myself only, the workings of my own mind, imputable to nobody else.\r\n\r\nThe anxieties which I know you have felt, on seeing exposed to the\r\njustlings of a warring world, a country to which, in early life, you\r\ndevoted your sword and services when oppressed by foreign dominion, were\r\nworthy of your philanthropy and disinterested attachment to the freedom\r\nand happiness of man. Although we have not made all the provisions which\r\nmight be necessary for a war in the field of Europe, yet we have not\r\nbeen inattentive to such as would be necessary here. From the moment\r\nthat the affair of the Chesapeake rendered the prospect of war imminent,\r\nevery faculty was exerted to be prepared for it, and I think I may\r\nventure to solace you with the assurance, that we are, in a good degree,\r\nprepared. Military stores for many campaigns are on hand, all the\r\nnecessary articles (sulphur excepted), and the art of preparing them\r\namong ourselves, abundantly; arms in our magazines for more men than\r\nwill ever be required in the field, and forty thousand new stand yearly\r\nadded, of our own fabrication, superior to any we have ever seen from\r\nEurope; heavy artillery much beyond our need; an increasing stock of\r\nfield-pieces, several founderies casting one every other day each; a\r\nmilitary school of about fifty students, which has been in operation a\r\ndozen years; and the manufacture of men constantly going on, and adding\r\nforty thousand young soldiers to our force every year that the war is\r\ndeferred: at all our sea-port towns of the least consequence we have\r\nerected works of defence, and assigned them gunboats, carrying one or\r\ntwo heavy pieces, either eighteen, twenty-four, or thirty-two pounders,\r\nsufficient in the smallest harbors to repel the predatory attacks of\r\nprivateers or single armed ships, and proportioned in the larger harbors\r\nto such more serious attacks as they may probably be exposed to. All\r\nthese were nearly completed, and their gunboats in readiness, when\r\nI retired from the government. The works of New York and New Orleans\r\nalone, being on a much larger scale, are not yet completed. The former\r\nwill be finished this summer, mounting four hundred and thirty-eight\r\nguns, and, with the aid of from fifty to one hundred gunboats, will\r\nbe adequate to the resistance of any fleet which will ever be trusted\r\nacross the Atlantic. The works for New Orleans are less advanced. These\r\nare our preparations. They are very different from what you will be told\r\nby newspapers, and travellers, even Americans. But it is not to them\r\nthe government communicates the public condition. Ask one of them if\r\nhe knows the exact state of any particular harbor, and you will find\r\nprobably that he does not know even that of the one he comes from. You\r\nwill ask, perhaps, where are the proofs of these preparations for\r\none who cannot go and see them. I answer, in the acts of Congress,\r\nauthorizing such preparations, and in your knowledge of me, that, if\r\nauthorized, they would be executed.\r\n\r\nTwo measures have not been adopted which I pressed on Congress\r\nrepeatedly at their meetings. The one, to settle the whole ungranted\r\nterritory of Orleans, by donations of land to able bodied young men, to\r\nbe engaged and carried there at the public expense, who would constitute\r\na force always ready on the spot to defend New Orleans. The other was,\r\nto class the militia according to the years of their birth, and make all\r\nthose from twenty to twenty-five liable to be trained and called into\r\nservice at a moment’s warning. This would have given us a force of three\r\nhundred thousand young men, prepared, by proper training, for service in\r\nany part of the United States; while those who had passed through that\r\nperiod would remain at home, liable to be used in their own or adjacent\r\nStates. These two measures would have completed what I deemed necessary\r\nfor the entire security of our country. They would have given me, on\r\nmy retirement from the government of the nation, the consolatory\r\nreflection, that having found, when I was called to it, not a single\r\nsea-port town in a condition to repel a levy of contribution by a single\r\nprivateer or pirate, I had left every harbor so prepared by works\r\nand gun-boats, as to be in a reasonable state of security against any\r\nprobable attack; the territory of Orleans acquired, and planted with an\r\ninternal force sufficient for its protection; and the whole territory of\r\nthe United States organized by such a classification of its male force,\r\nas would give it the benefit of all its young population for active\r\nservice, and that of a middle and advanced age for stationary defence.\r\nBut these measures will, I hope, be completed by my successor, who,\r\nto the purest principles of republican patriotism, adds a wisdom and\r\nforesight second to no man on earth.\r\n\r\nSo much as to my country. Now a word as to myself. I am retired to\r\nMonticello, where, in the bosom of my family, and surrounded by my\r\nbooks, I enjoy a repose to which I have been long a stranger. My\r\nmornings are devoted to correspondence. From breakfast to dinner, I am\r\nin my shops, my garden, or on horseback among my farms; from dinner to\r\ndark, I give to society and recreation with my neighbors and friends;\r\nand from candle-light to early bed-time, I read. My health is perfect;\r\nand my strength considerably reinforced by the activity of the course\r\nI pursue; perhaps it is as great as usually falls to the lot of near\r\nsixty-seven years of age. I talk of ploughs and harrows, seeding and\r\nharvesting, with my neighbors, and of politics too, if they choose,\r\nwith as little reserve as the rest of my fellow-citizens, and feel, at\r\nlength, the blessing of being free to say and do what I please, without\r\nbeing responsible for it to any mortal. A part of my occupation, and\r\nby no means the least pleasing, is the direction of the studies of such\r\nyoung men as ask it. They place themselves in the neighboring village,\r\nand have the use of my library and counsel, and make a part of my\r\nsociety. In advising the course of their reading, I endeavor to keep\r\ntheir attention fixed on the main objects of all science, the freedom\r\nand happiness of man. So that coming to bear a share in the councils\r\nand government of their country, they will keep ever in view the sole\r\nobjects of all legitimate government.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nInstead of the unalloyed happiness of retiring unembarrassed and\r\nindependent, to the enjoyment of my estate, which is ample for my\r\nlimited views, I have to pass such a length of time in a thraldom of\r\nmind never before known to me. Except, for this, my happiness would have\r\nbeen perfect. That yours may never know disturbance, and that you may\r\nenjoy as many years of life, health, and ease as yourself shall wish, is\r\nthe sincere prayer of your constant and affectionate friend.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXIX.--TO DOCTOR JONES, March 5, 1810\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR JONES.\r\n\r\nMonticello, March 5, 1810.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI received duly your favor of the 19th ultimo, and I salute you with\r\nall antient and recent recollections of friendship. I have learned,\r\nwith real sorrow, that circumstances have risen among our executive\r\ncounsellors, which have rendered foes those who once were friends.\r\nTo themselves it will be a source of infinite pain and vexation, and\r\ntherefore chiefly I lament it, for I have a sincere esteem for both\r\nparties. To the President it will be really inconvenient: but to the\r\nnation I do not know that it can do serious injury, unless we were to\r\nbelieve the newspapers, which pretend that Mr. Gallatin will go out.\r\nThat indeed would be a day of mourning for the United States: but I hope\r\nthat the position of both gentlemen may be made so easy as to give no\r\ncause for either to withdraw. The ordinary business of every day is done\r\nby consultation between the President and the Head of the department\r\nalone to which it belongs. For measures of importance or difficulty, a\r\nconsultation is held with the Heads of departments, either assembled, or\r\nby taking their opinions separately in conversation or in writing. The\r\nlatter is most strictly in the spirit of the constitution. Because the\r\nPresident, on weighing the advice of all, is left free to make up an\r\nopinion for himself. In this way they are not brought together, and it\r\nis not necessarily known to any what opinion the others have given. This\r\nwas General Washington’s practice for the first two or three years of\r\nhis administration, till the affairs of France and England threatened\r\nto embroil us, and rendered consideration and discussion desirable. In\r\nthese discussions, Hamilton and myself were daily pitted in the cabinet\r\nlike two cocks. We were then but four in number, and, according to the\r\nmajority, which of course was three to one, the President decided.\r\nThe pain was for Hamilton and myself, but the public experienced no\r\ninconvenience. I practised this last method, because the harmony was so\r\ncordial among us all, that we never failed, by a contribution of mutual\r\nviews of the subject, to form an opinion acceptable to the whole. I\r\nthink there never was one instance to the contrary, in any case of\r\nconsequence. Yet this does, in fact, transform the executive into a\r\ndirectory, and I hold the other method to be more constitutional. It is\r\nbetter calculated, too, to prevent collision and irritation, and to cure\r\nit, or at least suppress its effects when it has already taken place.\r\nIt is the obvious and sufficient remedy in the present case, and will\r\ndoubtless be resorted to.\r\n\r\nOur difficulties are indeed great, if we consider ourselves alone. But\r\nwhen viewed in comparison with those of Europe, they are the joys of\r\nParadise. In the eternal revolution of ages, the destinies have placed\r\nour portion of existence amidst such scenes of tumult and outrage, as no\r\nother period, within our knowledge, had presented. Every government but\r\none on the continent of Europe, demolished, a conqueror roaming over\r\nthe earth with havoc and destruction, a pirate spreading misery and ruin\r\nover the face of the ocean. Indeed, my friend, ours is a bed of roses.\r\nAnd the system of government which shall keep us afloat amidst this\r\nwreck of the world, will be immortalized in history. We have, to be\r\nsure, our petty squabbles and heart-burnings, and we have something of\r\nthe blue devils at times, as to these raw heads and bloody bones who are\r\neating up other nations. But happily for us, the Mammoth cannot swim,\r\nnor the Leviathan move on dry land: and if we will keep out of their\r\nway, they cannot get at us. If, indeed, we choose to place ourselves\r\nwithin the scope of their tether, a gripe of the paw, or flounce of the\r\ntail, may be our fortune. Our business certainly was to be still. But\r\na part of our nation chose to declare against this, in such a way as to\r\ncontrol the wisdom of the government. I yielded with others, to avoid\r\na greater evil. But from that moment, I have seen no system which could\r\nkeep us entirely aloof from these agents of destruction. If there be\r\nany, I am certain that you, my friends, now charged with the care of us\r\nall, will see and pursue it. I give myself, therefore, no trouble with\r\nthinking or puzzling about it. Being confident in my watchmen, I sleep\r\nsoundly. God bless you all, and send you a safe deliverance.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XC.--TO GOVERNOR LANGDON, March 5, 1810\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR LANGDON.\r\n\r\nMonticello, March 5, 1810.\r\n\r\nYour letter, my dear friend, of the 18th ultimo, comes like the\r\nrefreshing dews of the evening on a thirsty soil. It recalls antient as\r\nwell as recent recollections, very dear to my heart. For five and thirty\r\nyears we have walked together through a land of tribulations. Yet these\r\nhave passed away, and so I trust will those of the present day. The\r\ntoryism with which we struggled in ‘77, differed but in name from the\r\nfederalism of ‘99, with which we struggled also; and the Anglicism, of\r\n1808, against which we are now struggling, is but the same thing still,\r\nin another form. It is a longing for a King, and an English King, rather\r\nthan any other. This is the true source of their sorrows and wailings.\r\n\r\nThe fear that Bonaparte will come over to us and conquer us also, is\r\ntoo chimerical to be genuine. Supposing him to have finished Spain and\r\nPortugal, he has yet England and Russia to subdue. The maxim of war was\r\nnever sounder than in this case, not to leave an enemy in the rear;\r\nand especially where an insurrectionary flame is known to be under the\r\nembers, merely smothered, and ready to burst at every point. These two\r\nsubdued (and surely the Anglomen will not think the conquest of England\r\nalone a short work), ancient Greece and Macedonia, the cradle of\r\nAlexander, his prototype, and Constantinople, the seat of empire for the\r\nworld, would glitter more in his eye than our bleak mountains and rugged\r\nforests. Egypt, too, and the golden apples of Mauritania, have for more\r\nthan half a century fixed the longing eyes of France; and with Syria,\r\nyou know, he has an old affront to wipe out. Then come ‘Pontus and\r\nGalatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,’ the fine countries on the\r\nEuphrates and Tigris, the Oxus and Indus, and all beyond the Hyphasis,\r\nwhich bounded the glories of his Macedonian rival; with the invitations\r\nof his new British subjects on the banks of the Ganges, whom, after\r\nreceiving under his protection the mother country, he cannot refuse to\r\nvisit. When all this is done and settled, and nothing of the old world\r\nremains unsubdued, he may turn to the new one. But will he attack us\r\nfirst, from whom he will get but hard knocks, and no money? Or will\r\nhe first lay hold of the gold and silver of Mexico and Peru, and\r\nthe diamonds of Brazil? A republican Emperor, from his affection to\r\nrepublics, independent of motives of expediency, must grant to ours the\r\nCyclops’ boon of being the last devoured. While all this is doing, we\r\nare to suppose the chapter of accidents read out, and that nothing can\r\nhappen to cut short or disturb his enterprises.\r\n\r\nBut the Anglomen, it seems, have found out a much safer dependence, than\r\nall these chances of death or disappointment. That is, that we should\r\nfirst let England plunder us, as she has been doing for years, for fear\r\nBonaparte should do it; and then ally ourselves with her, and enter into\r\nthe war. A conqueror, whose career England could not arrest when aided\r\nby Russia, Austria, Prussia, Sweden, Spain, and Portugal, she is now\r\nto destroy, with all these on his side, by the aid of the United States\r\nalone. This, indeed, is making us a mighty people. And what is to be\r\nour security, that when embarked for her in the war, she will not make a\r\nseparate peace, and leave us in the lurch? Her good faith! The faith\r\nof a nation of merchants! The _Punica fides_ of modern Carthage! Of the\r\nfriend and protectress of Copenhagen! Of the nation who never admitted a\r\nchapter of morality into her political code! And is now boldly avowing,\r\nthat whatever power can make hers, is hers of right. Money, and not\r\nmorality, is the principle of commerce and commercial nations. But,\r\nin addition to this, the nature of the English government forbids, of\r\nitself, reliance on her engagements; and it is well known she has been\r\nthe least faithful to her alliances of any nation of Europe, since\r\nthe period of her history wherein she has been distinguished for her\r\ncommerce and corruption, that is to say, under the houses of Stuart and\r\nBrunswick. To Portugal alone she has steadily adhered, because, by her\r\nMethuin treaty, she had made it a colony, and one of the most valuable\r\nto her. It may be asked, what, in the nature of her government, unfits\r\nEngland for the observation of moral duties? In the first place, her\r\nKing is a cipher; his only function being to name the oligarchy which is\r\nto govern her. The parliament is, by corruption, the mere instrument\r\nof the will of the administration. The real power and property in the\r\ngovernment is in the great aristocratical families of the nation. The\r\nnest of office being too small for all of them to cuddle into at once,\r\nthe contest is eternal, which shall crowd the other out. For this\r\npurpose they are divided into two parties, the Ins and the Outs,\r\nso equal in weight, that a small matter turns the balance. To keep\r\nthemselves in, when they are in, every stratagem must be practised,\r\nevery artifice used, which may flatter the pride, the passions, or power\r\nof the nation. Justice, honor, faith, must yield to the necessity of\r\nkeeping themselves in place. The question, whether a measure is moral,\r\nis never asked; but whether it will nourish the avarice of their\r\nmerchants, or the piratical spirit of their navy, or produce any other\r\neffect which may strengthen them in their places. As to engagements,\r\nhowever positive, entered into by the predecessors of the Ins, why, they\r\nwere their enemies; they did every thing which was wrong; and to reverse\r\nevery thing they did, must, therefore, be right. This is the true\r\ncharacter of the English government in practice, however different\r\nits theory; and it presents the singular phenomenon of a nation, the\r\nindividuals of which are as faithful to their private engagements and\r\nduties, as honorable, as worthy, as those of any nation on earth, and\r\nwhose government is yet the most unprincipled at this day known. In\r\nan absolute government there can be no such equiponderant parties.\r\nThe despot is the government. His power, suppressing all opposition,\r\nmaintains his ministers firm in their places. What he has contracted,\r\ntherefore, through them, he has the power to observe with good faith;\r\nand he identifies his own honor and faith with that of his nation.\r\n\r\nWhen I observed, however, that the King of England was a cipher, I did\r\nnot mean to confine the observation to the mere individual now on that\r\nthrone. The practice of Kings marrying only into the families of Kings,\r\nhas been that of Europe for some centuries. Now, take any race of\r\nanimals, confine them in idleness and inaction, whether in a sty, a\r\nstable, or a state-room, pamper them with high diet, gratify all their\r\nsexual appetites, immerse them in sensualities, nourish their passions,\r\nlet every thing bend before them, and banish whatever might lead them to\r\nthink, and in a few generations they become all body, and no mind: and\r\nthis, too, by a law of nature, by that very law by which we are in the\r\nconstant practice of changing the characters and propensities of the\r\nanimals we raise for our own purposes. Such is the regimen in raising\r\nKings, and in this way they have gone on for centuries. While in Europe,\r\nI often amused myself with contemplating the characters of the then\r\nreigning sovereigns of Europe. Louis the XVI. was a fool, of my own\r\nknowledge, and in despite of the answers made for him at his trial.\r\nThe King of Spain was a fool, and of Naples the same. They passed their\r\nlives in hunting, and despatched two couriers a week, one thousand\r\nmiles, to let each other know what game they had killed the preceding\r\ndays. The King of Sardinia was a fool. All these were Bourbons. The\r\nQueen of Portugal, a Braganza, was an idiot by nature. And so was\r\nthe King of Denmark. Their sons, as regents, exercised the powers of\r\ngovernment. The King of Prussia, successor to the great Frederick, was\r\na mere hog in body as well as in mind. Gustavus of Sweden, and Joseph\r\nof Austria, were really crazy, and George of England you know was in a\r\nstraight waistcoat. There remained, then, none but old Catherine, who\r\nhad been too lately picked up to have lost her common sense. In this\r\nstate Bonaparte found Europe; and it was this state of its rulers which\r\nlost it with scarce a struggle. These animals had become without mind\r\nand powerless; and so will every hereditary monarch be after a few\r\ngenerations. Alexander, the grandson of Catherine, is as yet an\r\nexception. He is able to hold his own. But he is only of the third\r\ngeneration. His race is not yet worn out. And so endeth the book of\r\nKings, from all of whom the Lord deliver us and have you, my friend, and\r\nall such good men and true, in his holy keeping.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCI.--TO GENERAL DEARBORN, July 16,1810\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL DEARBORN.\r\n\r\nMonticello, July 16,1810.\r\n\r\nDear General and Friend,\r\n\r\nYour favor of May the 31st was duly received, and I join in\r\ncongratulations with you on the resurrection of republican principles\r\nin Massachusetts and New Hampshire, and the hope that the professors of\r\nthese principles will not again easily be driven off their ground. The\r\nfederalists, during their short-lived ascendancy, have, nevertheless,\r\nby forcing us from the embargo, inflicted a wound on our interests which\r\ncan never be cured, and on our affections which will require time to\r\ncicatrize. I ascribe all this to one pseudo-republican, Story. He came\r\non (in place of Crowningshield, I believe) and staid only a few days;\r\nlong enough, however, to get complete hold of Bacon, who giving in to\r\nhis representations, became panic-struck, and communicated his panic to\r\nhis colleagues, and they to a majority of the sound members of Congress.\r\nThey believed in the alternative of repeal or civil war, and produced\r\nthe fatal measure of repeal. This is the immediate parent of all our\r\npresent evils, and has reduced us to a low standing in the eyes of the\r\nworld. I should think that even the federalists themselves must now be\r\nmade, by their feelings, sensible of their error. The wealth which the\r\nembargo brought home safely, has now been thrown back into the laps of\r\nour enemies; and our navigation completely crushed, and by the unwise\r\nand unpatriotic conduct of those engaged in it. Should the orders prove\r\ngenuine, which are said to have been given against our fisheries, they,\r\ntoo, are gone: and if not true as yet, they will be true on the first\r\nbreeze of success which England shall feel: for it has now been some\r\nyears, that I am perfectly satisfied her intentions have been to claim\r\nthe ocean as her conquest, and prohibit any vessel from navigating it,\r\nbut on such a tribute as may enable her to keep up such a standing navy\r\nas will maintain her dominion over it. She has hauled in, or let herself\r\nout, been bold or hesitating, according to occurrences, but has in\r\nno situation done any thing which might amount to an acknowledged\r\nrelinquishment of her intentions. I have ever been anxious to avoid\r\na war with England, unless forced by a situation more losing than war\r\nitself. But I did believe we could coerce her to justice by peaceable\r\nmeans, and the embargo, evaded as it was, proved it would have coerced\r\nher, had it been honestly executed. The proof she exhibited on that\r\noccasion, that she can exercise such an influence in this country, as to\r\ncontrol the will of its government and three fourths of its people,\r\nand oblige the three fourths to submit to one fourth, is to me the most\r\nmortifying circumstance which has occurred since the establishment of\r\nour government. The only prospect I see of lessening that influence,\r\nis in her own conduct, and not from any thing in our power. Radically\r\nhostile to our navigation and commerce, and fearing its rivalry, she\r\nwill completely crush it, and force us to resort to agriculture,\r\nnot aware that we shall resort to manufactures also, and render her\r\nconquests over our navigation and commerce useless, at least, if not\r\ninjurious to herself in the end, and perhaps salutary to us, as removing\r\nout of our way the chief causes and provocations to war.\r\n\r\nBut these are views which concern the present and future generation,\r\namong neither of which I count myself. You may live to see the change in\r\nour pursuits, and chiefly in those of your own State, which England will\r\neffect. I am not certain that the change on Massachusetts, by driving\r\nher to agriculture, manufactures, and emigration, will lessen her\r\nhappiness. But once more to be done with politics. How does Mrs.\r\nDearborn do? How do you both like your situation? Do you amuse yourself\r\nwith a garden, a farm, or what? That your pursuits, whatever they\r\nbe, may make you both easy, healthy, and happy, is the prayer of your\r\nsincere friend,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCII.--TO J. B. COLVIN, September 20, 1810\r\n\r\nTO J. B. COLVIN.\r\n\r\nMonticello, September 20, 1810.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of the 14th has been duly received, and I have to thank you\r\nfor the many obliging things respecting myself which are said in it.\r\nIf I have left in the breasts of my fellow-citizens a sentiment of\r\nsatisfaction with my conduct in the transaction of their business, it\r\nwill soften the pillow of my repose through the residue of life.\r\n\r\nThe question you propose, whether circumstances do not sometimes occur,\r\nwhich make it a duty in officers of high trust, to assume authorities\r\nbeyond the law, is easy of solution in principle, but sometimes\r\nembarrassing in practice. A strict observance of the written laws, is\r\ndoubtless one of the high duties of a good citizen: but it is not the\r\nhighest. The laws of necessity, of self-preservation, of saving our\r\ncountry when in danger, are of higher obligation. To lose our country by\r\na scrupulous adherence to written law, would be to lose the law itself,\r\nwith life, liberty, property, and all those who are enjoying them with\r\nus; thus absurdly sacrificing the end to the means. When, in the battle\r\nof Germantown, General Washington’s army was annoyed from Chew’s\r\nhouse, he did not hesitate to plant his cannon against it, although\r\nthe property of a citizen. When he besieged Yorktown, he leveled the\r\nsuburbs, feeling that the laws of property must be postponed to the\r\nsafety of the nation. While the army was before York, the Governor of\r\nVirginia took horses, carriages, provisions, and even men, by force, to\r\nenable that army to stay together till it could master the public enemy;\r\nand he was justified. A ship at sea in distress for provisions,\r\nmeets another having abundance, yet refusing a supply; the law of\r\nself-preservation authorizes the distressed to take a supply by\r\nforce. In all these cases, the unwritten laws of necessity, of\r\nself-preservation, and of the public safety, control the written laws of\r\n_meum_ and _tuum_. Further to exemplify the principle, I will state an\r\nhypothetical case. Suppose it had been made known to the executive of\r\nthe Union in the autumn of 1805, that we might have the Floridas for\r\na reasonable sum, that that sum had not indeed been so appropriated\r\nby law, but that Congress were to meet within three weeks, and might\r\nappropriate it on the first or second day of their session. Ought he,\r\nfor so great an advantage to his country, to have risked himself by\r\ntranscending the law and making the purchase? The public advantage\r\noffered, in this supposed case, was indeed immense: but a reverence\r\nfor law, and the probability that the advantage might still be legally\r\naccomplished by a delay of only three weeks, were powerful reasons\r\nagainst hazarding the act. But suppose it foreseen that a John Randolph\r\nwould find means to protract the proceeding on it by Congress, until the\r\nensuing spring, by which time new circumstances would change the mind\r\nof the other party. Ought the executive, in that case, and with that\r\nforeknowledge, to have secured the good to his country, and to have\r\ntrusted to their justice for the transgression of the law? I think he\r\nought, and that the act would have been approved. After the affair of\r\nthe Chesapeake, we thought war a very possible result. Our magazines\r\nwere illy provided with some necessary articles, nor had any\r\nappropriations been made for their purchase. We ventured, however, to\r\nprovide them, and to place our country in safety; and stating the case\r\nto Congress, they sanctioned the act.\r\n\r\nTo proceed to the conspiracy of Burr, and particularly to General\r\nWilkinson’s situation in New Orleans. In judging this case, we are bound\r\nto consider the state of the information, correct and incorrect, which\r\nhe then possessed. He expected Burr and his band from above, a British\r\nfleet from below, and he knew there was a formidable conspiracy within\r\nthe city. Under these circumstances, was he justifiable, 1. In seizing\r\nnotorious conspirators? On this there can be but two opinions; one, of\r\nthe guilty and their accomplices; the other, that of all honest men.\r\n2. In sending them to the seat of government, when the written law gave\r\nthem a right to trial in the territory? The danger of their rescue, of\r\ntheir continuing their machinations, the tardiness and weakness of\r\nthe law, apathy of the judges, active patronage of the whole tribe of\r\nlawyers, unknown disposition of the juries, an hourly expectation of the\r\nenemy, salvation of the city, and of the Union itself, which would have\r\nbeen convulsed to its centre, had that conspiracy succeeded; all these\r\nconstituted a law of necessity and self-preservation, and rendered the\r\n_salus populi_ supreme over the written law. The officer who is called\r\nto act on this superior ground, does indeed risk himself on the justice\r\nof the controlling powers of the constitution, and his station makes\r\nit his duty to incur that risk. But those controlling powers, and\r\nhis fellow-citizens generally, are bound to judge according to the\r\ncircumstances under which he acted. They are not to transfer the\r\ninformation of this place or moment to the time and place of his action;\r\nbut to put themselves into his situation. We knew here that there never\r\nwas danger of a British fleet from below, and that Burr’s band was\r\ncrushed before it reached the Mississippi. But General Wilkinson’s\r\ninformation was very different, and he could act on no other.\r\n\r\nFrom these examples and principles you may see what I think on the\r\nquestion proposed. They do not go to the case of persons charged with\r\npetty duties, where consequences are trifling, and time allowed for\r\na legal course, nor to authorize them to take such cases out of the\r\nwritten law. In these, the example of overleaping the law is of\r\ngreater evil than a strict adherence to its imperfect provisions. It is\r\nincumbent on those only who accept of great charges, to risk themselves\r\non great occasions, when the safety of the nation, or some of its very\r\nhigh interests are at stake.\r\n\r\nAn officer is bound to obey orders: yet he would be a bad one who should\r\ndo it in cases for which they were not intended, and which involved the\r\nmost important consequences. The line of discrimination between cases\r\nmay be difficult; but the good officer is bound to draw it at his\r\nown peril, and throw himself on the justice of his country, and the\r\nrectitude of his motives.\r\n\r\nI have indulged freer views on this question, on your assurances that\r\nthey are for your own eye only, and that they will not get into the\r\nhands of news-writers. I met their scurrilities without concern, while\r\nin pursuit of the great interests with which I was charged. But in my\r\npresent retirement, no duty forbids my wish for quiet.\r\n\r\nAccept the assurances of my esteem and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCIII.--TO MR. LAW, January 15, 1811\r\n\r\nTO MR. LAW.\r\n\r\nMonticello, January 15, 1811.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nAn absence from home of some length has prevented my sooner\r\nacknowledging the receipt of your letter, covering the printed pamphlet,\r\nwhich the same absence has as yet prevented me from taking up, but which\r\nI know I shall read with great pleasure. Your favor of December the 22nd\r\nis also received.\r\n\r\nMr. Wagner’s malignity, like that of the rest of his tribe of brother\r\nprinters, who deal out calumnies for federal readers, gives me no pain.\r\nWhen a printer cooks up a falsehood, it is as easy to put it into the\r\nmouth of a Mr. Fox, as of a smaller man, and safer into that of a dead\r\nthan a living one. Your sincere attachment to this country, as well as\r\nto your native one, was never doubted by me; and in that persuasion, I\r\nfelt myself free to express to you my genuine sentiments with respect to\r\nEngland. No man was more sensible than myself of the just value of\r\nthe friendship of that country. There are between us so many of those\r\ncircumstances which naturally produce and cement kind dispositions, that\r\nif they could have forgiven our resistance to their usurpations, our\r\nconnections might have been durable, and have insured duration to both\r\nour governments. I wished, therefore, a cordial friendship with them,\r\nand I spared no occasion of manifesting this in our correspondence and\r\nintercourse with them; not disguising, however, my desire of friendship\r\nwith their enemy also. During the administration of Mr. Addington,\r\nI thought I discovered some friendly symptoms on the part of that\r\ngovernment; at least, we received some marks of respect from the\r\nadministration, and some of regret at the wrongs we were suffering from\r\ntheir country. So, also, during the short interval of Mr. Fox’s power.\r\nBut every other administration since our Revolution has been equally\r\nwanton in their injuries and insults, and has manifested equal hatred\r\nand aversion. Instead, too, of cultivating the government itself, whose\r\nprinciples are those of the great mass of the nation, they have\r\nadopted the miserable policy of teazing and embarrassing it, by allying\r\nthemselves with a faction here, not a tenth of the people, noisy and\r\nunprincipled, and which never can come into power while republicanism is\r\nthe spirit of the nation, and that must continue to be so, until such\r\na condensation of population shall have taken place as will require\r\ncenturies. Whereas, the good will of the government itself would give\r\nthem, and immediately, every benefit which reason or justice would\r\npermit it to give. With respect to myself, I saw great reason to believe\r\ntheir ministers were weak enough to credit the newspaper trash about a\r\nsupposed personal enmity in myself towards England. This wretched party\r\nimputation was beneath the notice of wise men. England never did me a\r\npersonal injury, other than in open war, and for numerous individuals\r\nthere, I have great esteem and friendship. And I must have had a\r\nmind far below the duties of my station, to have felt either national\r\npartialities or antipathies in conducting the affairs confided to me. My\r\naffections were first for my own country, and then, generally, for all\r\nmankind; and nothing but minds placing themselves above the passions, in\r\nthe functionaries of this country, could have preserved us from the\r\nwar to which their provocations have been constantly urging us. The\r\nwar interests in England include a numerous and wealthy part of their\r\npopulation; and their influence is deemed worth courting by ministers\r\nwishing to keep their places. Continually endangered by a powerful\r\nopposition, they find it convenient to humor the popular passions at the\r\nexpense of the public good. The shipping interest, commercial interest,\r\nand their janizaries of the navy, all fattening on war, will not be\r\nneglected by ministers of ordinary minds. Their tenure of office is so\r\ninfirm that they dare not follow the dictates of wisdom, justice,\r\nand the well calculated interests of their country. This vice, in the\r\nEnglish constitution, renders a dependance on that government very\r\nunsafe. The feelings of their King, too, fundamentally averse to us,\r\nhave added another motive for unfriendliness in his ministers. This\r\nobstacle to friendship, however, seems likely to be soon removed; and\r\nI verily believe the successor will come in with fairer and wiser\r\ndispositions towards us; perhaps on that event their conduct may be\r\nchanged. But what England is to become on the crush of her internal\r\nstructure, now seeming to be begun, I cannot foresee. Her monied\r\ninterest, created by her paper system, and now constituting a baseless\r\nmass of wealth equal to that of the owners of the soil, must disappear\r\nwith that system, and the medium for paying great taxes thus failing,\r\nher navy must be without support. That it shall be supported by\r\npermitting her to claim dominion of the ocean, and to levy tribute\r\non every flag traversing that, as lately attempted and not yet\r\nrelinquished, every nation must contest, even _ad internecionem_. And\r\nyet, that, retiring from this enormity, she should continue able to\r\ntake a fair share in the necessary equilibrium,of power on that element,\r\nwould be the desire of every nation.\r\n\r\nI feel happy in withdrawing my mind from these anxieties, and resigning\r\nmyself, for the remnant of life, to the care and guardianship of others.\r\nGood wishes are all an old man has to offer to his country or friends.\r\nMine attend yourself, with sincere assurances of esteem and respect,\r\nwhich, however, I should be better pleased to tender you in person,\r\nshould your rambles ever lead you into the vicinage of Monticello.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCIV.--TO DOCTOR BENJAMIN RUSH, January 16, 1811\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR BENJAMIN RUSH.\r\n\r\nMonticello, January 16, 1811.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI had been considering for some days, whether it was not time by a\r\nletter, to bring myself to your recollection, when I received\r\nyour welcome favor of the 2nd instant. I had before heard of the\r\nheart-rending calamity you mention, and had sincerely sympathized with\r\nyour afflictions. But I had not made it the subject of a letter, because\r\nI knew that condolences were but renewals of grief. Yet I thought, and\r\nstill think, this is one of the cases wherein we should ‘not sorrow,\r\neven as others who have no hope.’\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nYou ask if I have read Hartley? I have not. ‘My present course of life\r\nadmits less reading than I wish. From breakfast, or noon at latest,\r\nto dinner, I am mostly on horseback, attending to my farms or other\r\nconcerns, which I find healthful to my body, mind, and affairs; and the\r\nfew hours I can pass in my cabinet, are devoured by correspondences;\r\nnot those with my intimate friends, with whom I delight to interchange\r\nsentiments, but with others, who, writing to me on concerns of their\r\nown in which I have had an agency, or from motives of mere respect and\r\napprobation, are entitled to be answered with respect and a return of\r\ngood will. My hope is that this obstacle to the delights of retirement\r\nwill wear away with the oblivion which follows that, and that I may at\r\nlength be indulged in those studious pursuits, from which nothing but\r\nrevolutionary duties would ever have called me.\r\n\r\nI shall receive your proposed publication, and read it with the pleasure\r\nwhich every thing gives me from your pen. Although much of a sceptic in\r\nthe practice of medicine, I read with pleasure its ingenious theories.\r\n\r\nI receive with sensibility your observations on the discontinuance of\r\nfriendly correspondence between Mr. Adams and myself, and the concern\r\nyou take in its restoration. This discontinuance has not proceeded from\r\nme, nor from the want of sincere desire, and of effort on my part, to\r\nrenew our intercourse. You know the perfect coincidence of principle and\r\nof action, in the early part of the Revolution, which produced a high\r\ndegree of mutual respect and esteem between Mr. Adams and myself.\r\nCertainly no man was ever truer than he was, in that day, to those\r\nprinciples of rational republicanism, which, after the necessity of\r\nthrowing off our monarchy, dictated all our efforts in the establishment\r\nof a new government. And although he swerved, afterwards, towards the\r\nprinciples of the English constitution, our friendship did not abate on\r\nthat account. While he was Vice-President, and I Secretary of State,\r\nI received a letter from President Washington, then at Mount Vernon,\r\ndesiring me to call together the Heads of departments, and to invite Mr.\r\nAdams to join us (which, by the bye, was the only instance of that being\r\ndone) in order to determine on some measure which required despatch; and\r\nhe desired me to act on it, as decided, without again recurring to him.\r\nI invited them to dine with me, and after dinner, sitting at our wine,\r\nhaving settled our question, other conversation came on, in which a\r\ncollision of opinion arose between Mr. Adams and Colonel Hamilton,\r\non the merits of the British Constitution, Mr. Adams giving it as his\r\nopinion, that, if some of its defects and abuses were corrected, it\r\nwould be the most perfect constitution of government ever devised by\r\nman. Hamilton, on the contrary, asserted, that with its existing vices,\r\nit was the most perfect model of government that could be formed;\r\nand that the correction of its vices would render it an impracticable\r\ngovernment. And this you may be assured was the real line of difference\r\nbetween the political principles of these two gentlemen. Another\r\nincident took place on the same occasion, which will further delineate\r\nHamilton’s political principles. The room being hung around with a\r\ncollection of the portraits of remarkable men, among them were those of\r\nBacon, Newton, and Locke. Hamilton asked me who they were. I told\r\nhim they were my trinity of the three greatest men the world had ever\r\nproduced, naming them. He paused for some time: ‘The greatest man,’\r\nsaid he, ‘that ever lived, was Julius Caesar.’ Mr. Adams was honest as\r\na politician, as well as a man; Hamilton honest as a man, but, as a\r\npolitician, believing in the necessity of either force or corruption to\r\ngovern men.\r\n\r\nYou remember the machinery which the federalists played off, about\r\nthat time, to beat down the friends to the real principles of our\r\nconstitution, to silence by terror every expression in their favor, to\r\nbring us into war with France and alliance with England, and finally to\r\nhomologize our constitution with that of England. Mr. Adams, you know,\r\nwas overwhelmed with feverish addresses, dictated by the fear, and often\r\nby the pen of the _bloody buoy_, and was seduced by them into some open\r\nindications of his new principles of government, and in fact, was so\r\nelated as to mix with his kindness a little superciliousness towards\r\nme. Even Mrs. Adams, with all her good sense and prudence, was sensibly\r\nflushed. And you recollect the short suspension of our intercourse, and\r\nthe circumstance which gave rise to it, which you were so good as to\r\nbring to an early explanation, and have set to rights, to the cordial\r\nsatisfaction of us all. The nation at length passed condemnation on the\r\npolitical principles of the federalists, by refusing to continue Mr.\r\nAdams in the Presidency. On the day on which we learned in Philadelphia\r\nthe vote of the city of New York, which it was well known would decide\r\nthe vote of the State, and that, again, the vote of the Union, I called\r\non Mr. Adams on some official business. He was very sensibly affected,\r\nand accosted me with these words. ‘Well, I understand that you are to\r\nbeat me in this contest, and I will only say that I will be as faithful\r\na subject as any you will have.’ ‘Mr. Adams,’ said I, ‘this is no\r\npersonal contest between you and me. Two systems of principles on the\r\nsubject of government divide our fellow-citizens into two parties. With\r\none of these you concur, and I with the other. As we have been longer on\r\nthe public stage than most of those now living, our names happen to be\r\nmore generally known. One of these parties, therefore, has put your name\r\nat its head, the other mine. Were we both to die to-day, to-morrow two\r\nother names would be in the place of ours, without any change in the\r\nmotion of the machine. Its motion is from its principle, not from you\r\nor myself.’ ‘I believe you are right,’ said he, ‘that we are but passive\r\ninstruments, and should not suffer this matter to affect our personal\r\ndispositions.’ But he did not long retain this just view of the\r\nsubject. I have always believed that the thousand calumnies which\r\nthe federalists, in bitterness of heart, and mortification at their\r\nejection, daily invented against me, were carried to him by their busy\r\nintriguers, and made some impression. When the election between Burr and\r\nmyself was kept in suspense by the federalists, and they were meditating\r\nto place the President of the Senate at the head of the government, I\r\ncalled on Mr. Adams with a view to have this desperate measure prevented\r\nby his negative. He grew warm in an instant, and said with a vehemence\r\nhe had not used towards me before, ‘Sir, the event of the election is\r\nwithin your own power. You have only to say you will do justice to\r\nthe public creditors, maintain the navy, and not disturb those holding\r\noffices, and the government will instantly be put into your hands. We\r\nknow it is the wish of the people it should be so.’ ‘Mr. Adams,’ said I,\r\n‘I know not what part of my conduct, in either public or private life,\r\ncan have authorized a doubt of my fidelity to the public engagements.\r\nI say, however, I will not come into the government by capitulation. I\r\nwill not enter on it, but in perfect freedom to follow the dictates\r\nof my own judgment.’ I had before given the same answer to the same\r\nintimation from Gouverneur Morris. ‘Then,’ said he, ‘things must take\r\ntheir course.’ I turned the conversation to something else, and soon\r\ntook my leave. It was the first time in our lives we had ever parted\r\nwith any thing like dissatisfaction. And then followed those scenes of\r\nmidnight appointment, which have been condemned by all men. The last day\r\nof his political power, the last hours, and even beyond the midnight,\r\nwere employed in filling all offices and especially permanent ones, with\r\nthe bitterest federalists, and providing for me the alternative, either\r\nto execute the government by my enemies, whose study it would be\r\nto thwart and defeat all my measures, or to incur the odium of such\r\nnumerous removals from office, as might bear me down. A little time and\r\nreflection effaced in my mind this temporary dissatisfaction with\r\nMr. Adams, and restored me to that just estimate of his virtues and\r\npassions, which a long acquaintance had enabled me to fix. And my first\r\nwish became that of making his retirement easy by any means in my power;\r\nfor it was understood he was not rich. I suggested to some republican\r\nmembers of the delegation from his State, the giving him, either\r\ndirectly or indirectly, an office, the most lucrative in that State,\r\nand then offered to be resigned, if they thought he would not deem it\r\naffrontive. They were of opinion he would take great offence at the\r\noffer; and, moreover, that the body of republicans would consider such\r\na step in the outset, as auguring very ill of the course I meant to\r\npursue. I dropped the idea, therefore, but did not cease to wish for\r\nsome opportunity of renewing our friendly understanding.\r\n\r\nTwo or three years after, having had the misfortune to lose a daughter,\r\nbetween whom and Mrs. Adams there had been a considerable attachment,\r\nshe made it the occasion of writing me a letter, in which, with the\r\ntenderest expressions of concern at this event, she carefully avoided a\r\nsingle one of friendship towards myself, and even concluded it with\r\nthe wishes ‘of her who once took pleasure in subscribing herself your\r\nfriend, Abigail Adams.’ Unpromising as was the complexion of this\r\nletter, I determined to make an effort towards removing the clouds from\r\nbetween us. This brought on a correspondence which I now enclose for\r\nyour perusal, after which be so good as to return it to me, as I have\r\nnever communicated it to any mortal breathing, before. I send it to you,\r\nto convince you I have not been wanting either in the desire, or the\r\nendeavor to remove this misunderstanding. Indeed, I thought it highly\r\ndisgraceful to us both, as indicating minds not sufficiently elevated to\r\nprevent a public competition from affecting our personal friendship. I\r\nsoon found from the correspondence that conciliation was desperate,\r\nand yielding to an intimation in her last letter, I ceased from further\r\nexplanation. I have the same good opinion of Mr. Adams which I ever had.\r\nI know him to be an honest man, an able one with his pen, and he was a\r\npowerful advocate on the floor of Congress. He has been alienated from\r\nme, by belief in the lying suggestions contrived for electioneering\r\npurposes, that I perhaps mixed in the activity and intrigues of the\r\noccasion. My most intimate friends can testify that I was perfectly\r\npassive. They would sometimes, indeed, tell me what was going on; but\r\nno man ever heard me take part in such conversations; and none ever\r\nmisrepresented Mr. Adams in my presence without my asserting his just\r\ncharacter. With very confidential persons I have doubtless disapproved\r\nof the principles and practices of his administration. This was\r\nunavoidable. But never with those with whom it could do him any injury.\r\nDecency would have required this conduct from me, if disposition had\r\nnot: and I am satisfied Mr. Adams’s conduct was equally honorable\r\ntowards me. But I think it part of his character to suspect foul play\r\nin those of whom he is jealous, and not easily to relinquish his\r\nsuspicions.\r\n\r\nI have gone, my dear friend, into these details, that you might know\r\nevery thing which had passed between us, might be fully possessed of\r\nthe state of facts and dispositions, and judge for yourself whether they\r\nadmit a revival of that friendly intercourse for which you are so kindly\r\nsolicitous. I shall certainly not be wanting in any thing on my part\r\nwhich may second your efforts; which will be the easier with me,\r\ninasmuch as I do not entertain a sentiment of Mr. Adams, the expression\r\nof which could give him reasonable offence. And I submit the whole to\r\nyourself, with the assurance, that whatever be the issue, my friendship\r\nand respect for yourself will remain unaltered and unalterable.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCV.--TO M. DESTUTT TRACY, January 26, 1811\r\n\r\nTO M. DESTUTT TRACY.\r\n\r\nMonticello, January 26, 1811.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe length of time your favor of June the 12th, 1809, was on its way\r\nto me, and my absence from home the greater part of the autumn, delayed\r\nvery much the pleasure which awaited me of reading the packet which\r\naccompanied it. I cannot express to you the satisfaction which I\r\nreceived from its perusal. I had, with the world, deemed Montesquieu’s\r\na work of much merit; but saw in it, with every thinking man, so much of\r\nparadox, of false principle, and misapplied fact, as to render its value\r\nequivocal on the whole. Williams and others had nibbled only at\r\nits errors. A radical correction of them, therefore, was a great\r\ndesideratum. This want is now supplied, and with a depth of thought,\r\nprecision; of idea, of language, and of logic, which will force\r\nconviction into every mind. I declare to you, Sir, in the spirit of\r\ntruth and sincerity, that I consider it the most precious gift the\r\npresent age has received. But what would it have been, had the author,\r\nor would the author, take up the whole scheme of Montesquieu’s work, and\r\nfollowing the correct analysis he has here developed, fill up all its\r\nparts according to his sound views of them. Montesquieu’s celebrity\r\nwould be but a small portion of that which would immortalize the author.\r\nAnd with whom? With the rational and high-minded spirits of the present\r\nand all future ages. With those whose approbation is both incitement\r\nand reward to virtue and ambition. Is then the hope desperate? To what\r\nobject can the occupation of his future life be devoted so usefully to\r\nthe world, so splendidly to himself? But I must leave to others who have\r\nhigher claims on his attention, to press these considerations.\r\n\r\nMy situation, far in the interior of the country, was not favorable to\r\nthe object of getting this work translated and printed. Philadelphia is\r\nthe least distant of the great towns of our States, where there exists\r\nany enterprise in this way; and it was not till the spring following\r\nthe receipt of your letter, that I obtained an arrangement for its\r\nexecution. The translation is just now completed. The sheets came to me\r\nby post, from time to time, for revisal; but not being accompanied by\r\nthe original, I could not judge of verbal accuracies. I think, however,\r\nit is substantially correct, without being an adequate representation\r\nof the excellences of the original; as indeed no translation can be. I\r\nfound it impossible to give it the appearance of an original composition\r\nin our language. I therefore think it best to divert inquiries after the\r\nauthor towards a quarter where he will not be found; and with this view,\r\npropose to prefix the prefatory epistle now enclosed. As soon as a copy\r\nof the work can be had, I will send it to you by duplicate. The secret\r\nof the author will be faithfully preserved during his and my joint\r\nlives; and those into whose hands my papers will fall at my death will\r\nbe equally worthy of confidence. When the death of the author, or his\r\nliving consent shall permit the world to know their benefactor, both\r\nhis and my papers will furnish the evidence. In the mean time, the many\r\nimportant truths the works so solidly establishes, will, I hope, make it\r\nthe political rudiment of the young, and manual of our older citizens.\r\n\r\nOne of its doctrines, indeed, the preference of a plural over a singular\r\nexecutive, will probably not be assented to here. When our present\r\ngovernment was first established, we had many doubts on this question,\r\nand many leanings towards a supreme executive council. It happened that\r\nat that time the experiment of such an one was commenced in France,\r\nwhile the single executive was under trial here. We watched the motions\r\nand effects of these two rival plans, with an interest and anxiety\r\nproportioned to the importance of a. choice between them. The experiment\r\nin France failed after a short course, and not from any circumstance\r\npeculiar to the times or nation, but from those internal jealousies and\r\ndissensions in the Directory, which will ever arise among men equal in\r\npower, without a principal to decide and control their differences. We\r\nhad tried a similar experiment in 1784, by establishing a committee of\r\nthe States, composed of a member from every State, then thirteen, to\r\nexercise the executive functions during the recess of Congress. They\r\nfell immediately into schisms and dissensions, which became at length so\r\ninveterate as to render all co-operation among them impracticable:\r\nthey dissolved themselves, abandoning the helm of government, and it\r\ncontinued without a head, until Congress met the ensuing winter. This\r\nwas then imputed to the temper of two or three individuals; but the wise\r\nascribed it to the nature of man. The failure of the French Directory,\r\nand from the same cause, seems to have authorized a belief that the form\r\nof a plurality, however promising in theory, is impracticable with men\r\nconstituted with the ordinary passions. While the tranquil and steady\r\ntenor of our single executive, during a course of twenty-two years of\r\nthe most tempestuous times the history of the world has ever presented,\r\ngives a rational hope that this important problem is at length solved.\r\nAided by the counsels of a cabinet of Heads of departments, originally\r\nfour, but now five, with whom the President consults, either singly or\r\nall together, he has the benefit of their wisdom and information, brings\r\ntheir views to one centre, and produces an unity of action and\r\ndirection in all the branches of the government. The excellence of this\r\nconstruction of the executive power has already manifested itself here\r\nunder very opposite circumstances. During the administration of our\r\nfirst President, his cabinet of four members was equally divided, by as\r\nmarked an opposition of principle, as monarchism and republicanism could\r\nbring into conflict. Had that cabinet been a directory, like positive\r\nand negative quantities in Algebra, the opposing wills would have\r\nbalanced each other, and produced a state of absolute inaction. But the\r\nPresident heard with calmness the opinions and reasons of each, decided\r\nthe course to be pursued, and kept the government steadily in it,\r\nunaffected by the agitation. The public knew well the dissensions of the\r\ncabinet, but never had an uneasy thought on their account; because they\r\nknew also they had provided a regulating power, which would keep the\r\nmachine in steady movement. I speak with an intimate knowledge of these\r\nscenes, _quorum pars fui_; as I may of others of a character entirely\r\nopposite. The third administration, which was of eight years, presented\r\nan example of harmony in a cabinet of six persons, to which perhaps\r\nhistory has furnished no parallel. There never arose, during the whole\r\ntime, an instance of an unpleasant thought or word between the members.\r\nWe sometimes met under differences of opinion, but scarcely ever failed,\r\nby conversing and reasoning, so to modify each other’s ideas, as to\r\nproduce an unanimous result. Yet, able and amiable as these members\r\nwere, I am not certain this would have been the case, had each possessed\r\nequal and independent powers. Ill defined limits of their respective\r\ndepartments, jealousies, trifling at first, but nourished and\r\nstrengthened by repetition of occasions, intrigues without doors of\r\ndesigning persons to build an importance to themselves on the divisions\r\nof others, might, from small beginnings, have produced persevering\r\noppositions. But the power of decision in the President left no object\r\nfor internal dissension, and external intrigue was stifled in embryo by\r\nthe knowledge which incendiaries possessed, that no divisions they\r\ncould foment would change the course of the executive power. I am not\r\nconscious that my participations in executive authority have produced\r\nany bias in favor of the single executive; because the parts I have\r\nacted have been in the subordinate, as well as superior stations, and\r\nbecause, if I know myself, what I have felt, and what I have wished, I\r\nknow that I have never been so well pleased, as when I could shift power\r\nfrom my own, on the shoulders of others; nor have I ever been able to\r\nconceive how any rational being could propose happiness to himself from\r\nthe exercise of power over others.\r\n\r\nI am still, however, sensible of the solidity of your principle, that,\r\nto insure the safety of the public liberty, its depository should be\r\nsubject to be changed with the greatest ease possible, and without\r\nsuspending or disturbing for a moment the movements of the machine of\r\ngovernment. You apprehend that a single executive, with, eminence of\r\ntalent, and destitution of principle, equal to the object, might, by\r\nusurpation, render his powers hereditary. Yet I think history furnishes\r\nas many examples of a single usurper arising out of a government by a\r\nplurality, as of temporary trusts of power in a single hand rendered\r\npermanent by usurpation. I do not believe, therefore, that this danger\r\nis lessened in the hands of a plural executive. Perhaps it is greatly\r\nincreased, by the state of inefficiency to which they are liable from\r\nfeuds and divisions among themselves. The conservative body you propose\r\nmight be so constituted, as, while it would be an admirable sedative in\r\na variety of smaller cases, might also be a valuable sentinel and check\r\non the liberticide views of an ambitious individual. I am friendly to\r\nthis idea. But the true barriers of our liberty in this country are our\r\nState governments: and the wisest conservative power ever contrived by\r\nman, is that of which our Revolution and present government found us\r\npossessed. Seventeen distinct States, amalgamated into one as to their\r\nforeign concerns, but single and independent as to their internal\r\nadministration, regularly organized with a legislature and governor\r\nresting on the choice of the people, and enlightened by a free press,\r\ncan never be so fascinated by the arts of one man, as to submit\r\nvoluntarily to his usurpation. Nor can they be constrained to it by any\r\nforce he can possess. While that may paralyze the single State in which\r\nit happens to be encamped, sixteen others, spread over a country of\r\ntwo thousand miles diameter, rise up on every side, ready organized for\r\ndeliberation by a constitutional legislature, and for action by their\r\ngovernor, constitutionally the commander of the militia of the State,\r\nthat is to say, of every man in it, able to bear arms; and that militia,\r\ntoo, regularly formed into regiments and battalions, into infantry,\r\ncavalry, and artillery, trained under officers general and subordinate,\r\nlegally appointed, always in readiness, and to whom they are already\r\nin habits of obedience. The republican government of France was lost\r\nwithout a struggle, because the party of ‘_un et indivisible_’ had\r\nprevailed: no provincial organizations existed to which the people\r\nmight rally under authority of the laws, the seats of the directory were\r\nvirtually vacant, and a small force sufficed to turn the legislature out\r\nof their chamber and to salute its leader chief of the nation. But\r\nwith us, sixteen out of seventeen States rising in mass, under regular\r\norganization and legal commanders, united in object and action by their\r\nCongress, or, if that be in duresse, by a special convention, present\r\nsuch obstacles to an usurper as for ever to stifle ambition in the first\r\nconception of that object.\r\n\r\nDangers of another kind might more reasonably be apprehended from this\r\nperfect and distinct organization, civil and military, of the States; to\r\nwit, that certain States, from local and occasional discontents, might\r\nattempt to secede from the Union. This is certainly possible; and would\r\nbe befriended by this regular organization. But it is not probable that\r\nlocal discontents can spread to such an extent, as to be able to face\r\nthe sound parts of so extensive an union: and if ever they could reach\r\nthe majority, they would then become the regular government, acquire the\r\nascendancy in Congress, and be able to redress their own grievances by\r\nlaws peaceably and constitutionally passed. And even the States in which\r\nlocal discontents might engender a commencement of fermentation, would\r\nbe paralyzed and self-checked by that very division into parties into\r\nwhich we have fallen, into which all States must fall wherein men are at\r\nliberty to think, speak, and act freely, according to the diversities\r\nof their individual conformations, and which are, perhaps, essential\r\nto preserve the purity of the government, by the censorship which these\r\nparties habitually exercise over each other.\r\n\r\nYou will read, I am sure, with indulgence, the explanations of the\r\ngrounds on which I have ventured to form an opinion differing from\r\nyours. They prove my respect for your judgment, and diffidence of my\r\nown, which have forbidden me to retain, without examination, an opinion\r\nquestioned by you. Permit me now to render my portion of the general\r\ndebt of gratitude, by acknowledgments in advance for the singular\r\nbenefaction which is the subject of this letter, to tender my wishes\r\nfor the continuance of a life so usefully employed, and to add the\r\nassurances of my perfect esteem and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCVI.--TO COLONEL MONROE, May 5, 1811\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\nMonticello, May 5, 1811.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favor on your departure from Richmond came to hand in due time.\r\nAlthough I may not have been among the first, I am certainly with the\r\nsincerest, who congratulate you on your re-entrance into the national\r\ncouncils. Your value there has never been unduly estimated by those\r\nwhom personal feelings did not misguide. The late misunderstandings at\r\nWashington have been a subject of real concern to me. I know that\r\nthe dissolutions of personal friendships are among the most painful\r\noccurrences in human life. I have sincere esteem for all who have been\r\naffected by them, having passed with them eight years of great harmony\r\nand affection. These incidents are rendered more distressing in our\r\ncountry than elsewhere, because our printers ravin on the agonies of\r\ntheir victims, as wolves do on the blood of the lamb. But the printers\r\nand the public are very different personages. The former may lead the\r\nlatter a little out of their track, while the deviation is insensible:\r\nbut the moment they usurp their direction and that of their government,\r\nthey will be reduced to their true places. The two last Congresses have\r\nbeen the theme of the most licentious reprobation for printers thirsting\r\nafter war, some against France, and some against England. But the people\r\nwish for peace with both. They feel no incumbency on them to become\r\nthe reformers of the other hemisphere, and to inculcate, with fire and\r\nsword, a return to moral order. When, indeed, peace shall become more\r\nlosing than war, they may owe to their interest, what these Quixottes\r\nare clamoring for on false estimates of honor. The public are unmoved by\r\nthese clamors, as the re-election of their legislators shows, and they\r\nare firm to their executive on the subject of the more recent clamors.\r\n\r\nWe are suffering here both in the gathered and the growing crop. The\r\nlowness of the river, and great quantity of produce brought to Milton\r\nthis year, render it almost impossible to get our crops to market.\r\nThis is the case of mine as well as yours: and the Hessian fly appears\r\nalarmingly in our growing crop. Every thing is in distress for the want\r\nof rain.\r\n\r\nPresent me respectfully to Mrs. Monroe, and accept yourself assurances\r\nof my constant and affectionate esteem.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCVII.--TO GENERAL DEARBORN, August 14, 1811\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL DEARBORN.\r\n\r\nPoplar Forest, August 14, 1811.\r\n\r\nDear General and Friend,\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nI am happy to learn that your own health is good, and I hope it will\r\nlong continue so. The friends we left behind us have fallen out by the\r\nway. I sincerely lament it, because I sincerely esteem them all, and\r\nbecause it multiplies schisms where harmony is safety. As far as I have\r\nbeen able to judge, however, it has made no sensible impression against\r\nthe government. Those who were murmuring before are a little louder now;\r\nbut the mass of our citizens is firm and unshaken. It furnishes, as an\r\nincident, another proof that they are perfectly equal to the purposes of\r\nself-government, and that we have nothing to fear for its stability. The\r\nspirit, indeed, which manifests itself among the tories of your quarter,\r\nalthough I believe there is a majority there sufficient to keep it down\r\nin peaceable times, leaves me not without some disquietude. Should the\r\ndetermination of England, now formally expressed, to take possession of\r\nthe ocean, and to suffer no commerce on it but through her ports, force\r\na war upon us, I foresee a possibility of a separate treaty between\r\nher and your Essex men, on the principles of neutrality and commerce.\r\nPickering here, and his nephew Williams there, can easily negotiate\r\nthis. Such a lure to the quietists in our ranks with you, might recruit\r\ntheirs to a majority. Yet, excluded as they would be from intercourse\r\nwith the rest of the Union and of Europe, I scarcely see the gain they\r\nwould propose to themselves, even for the moment. The defection would\r\ncertainly disconcert the other States, but it could not ultimately\r\nendanger their safety. They are adequate, in all points, to a defensive\r\nwar. However, I hope your majority, with the aid it is entitled to, will\r\nsave us from this trial, to which I think it possible we are advancing.\r\nThe death of George may come to our relief; but I fear the dominion\r\nof the sea is the insanity of the nation itself also. Perhaps, if some\r\nstroke of fortune were to rid us at the same time from the Mammoth of\r\nthe land as well as the Leviathan of the ocean, the people of England\r\nmight lose their fears, and recover their sober senses again. Tell my\r\nold friend, Governor Gerry, that I gave him glory for the rasping with\r\nwhich he rubbed down his herd of traitors. Let them have justice\r\nand protection against personal violence, but no favor. Powers and\r\npre-eminences conferred on them are daggers put into the hands of\r\nassassins, to be plunged into our own bosoms in the moment the thrust\r\ncan go home to the heart. Moderation can never reclaim them. They deem\r\nit timidity, and despise without fearing the tameness from which it\r\nflows. Backed by England, they never lose the hope that their day is to\r\ncome, when the terrorism of their earlier power is to be merged in the\r\nmore gratifying system,of deportation and the guillotine. Being now\r\n_hors de combat_ myself, I resign to others these cares. A long attack\r\nof rheumatism has greatly enfeebled me, and warns me, that they will not\r\nvery long be within my ken. But you may have to meet the trial, and in\r\nthe focus of its fury. God send you a safe deliverance, a happy issue\r\nout of all afflictions, personal and public, with long life, long\r\nhealth, and friends as sincerely attached, as yours affectionately,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCVIII.--TO DOCTOR BENJAMIN RUSH\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR BENJAMIN RUSH.\r\n\r\nPoplar Forest, December 5, 1811.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nWhile at Monticello I am so much engrossed by business or society, that\r\nI can only write on matters of strong urgency. Here I have leisure, as\r\nI have every where the disposition, to think of my friends. I recur,\r\ntherefore, to the subject of your kind letters relating to Mr. Adams\r\nand myself, which a late occurrence has again presented to me. I\r\ncommunicated to you the correspondence which had parted Mrs. Adams and\r\nmyself, in proof that I could not give friendship in exchange for such\r\nsentiments as she had recently taken up towards myself, and avowed and\r\nmaintained in her letters to me. Nothing but a total renunciation of\r\nthese could admit a reconciliation, and that could be cordial only in\r\nproportion as the return to ancient opinions was believed sincere. In\r\nthese jaundiced sentiments of hers I had associated Mr. Adams, knowing\r\nthe weight which her opinions had with him, and notwithstanding she\r\ndeclared in her letters that they were not communicated to him. A late\r\nincident has satisfied me that I wronged him as well as her in not\r\nyielding entire confidence to this assurance on her part. Two of the Mr.\r\n------, my neighbors and friends, took a tour to the northward during\r\nthe last summer. In Boston they fell into company with Mr. Adams, and by\r\nhis invitation passed a day with him at Braintree. He spoke out to\r\nthem every thing which came uppermost, and as it occurred to his mind,\r\nwithout any reserve, and seemed most disposed to dwell on those things\r\nwhich happened during his own administration. He spoke of his masters,\r\nas he called his Heads of departments, as acting above his control, and\r\noften against his opinions. Among many other topics, he adverted to\r\nthe unprincipled licentiousness of the press against myself, adding, ‘I\r\nalways loved Jefferson, and still love him.’\r\n\r\nThis is enough for me. I only needed this knowledge to revive towards\r\nhim all the affections of the most cordial moments of our lives.\r\nChanging a single word only in Dr. Franklin’s character of him, I\r\nknew him to be always an honest man, often a great one, but sometimes\r\nincorrect and precipitate in his judgments: and it is known to those who\r\nhave ever heard me speak of Mr. Adams, that I have ever done him justice\r\nmyself, and defended him when assailed by others, with the single\r\nexception as to his political opinions. But with a man possessing so\r\nmany other estimable qualities, why should we be dissocialized by mere\r\ndifferences of opinion in politics, in religion, in philosophy, or any\r\nthing else. His opinions are as honestly formed as my own. Our different\r\nviews of the same subject are the result of a difference in our\r\norganization and experience. I never withdrew from the society of any\r\nman on this account, although many have done it from me; much less\r\nshould I do it from one with whom I had gone through, with hand and\r\nheart, so many trying scenes. I wish, therefore, but for an apposite\r\noccasion to express to Mr. Adams my unchanged affections for him. There\r\nis an awkwardness which hangs over the resuming a correspondence so\r\nlong discontinued, unless something could arise which should call for a\r\nletter. Time and chance may perhaps generate such an occasion, of which\r\nI shall not be wanting in promptitude to avail myself. From this fusion\r\nof mutual affections, Mrs. Adams is of course separated. It will only be\r\nnecessary that I never name her. In your letters to Mr. Adams, you can,\r\nperhaps, suggest my continued cordiality towards him, and knowing this,\r\nshould an occasion of writing first present itself to him, he will\r\nperhaps avail himself of it, as I certainly will, should it first occur\r\nto me. No ground for jealousy now existing, he will certainly give fair\r\nplay to the natural warmth of his heart. Perhaps I may open the way\r\nin some letter to my old friend Gerry, who I know is in habits of the\r\ngreatest intimacy with him.\r\n\r\nI have thus, my friend, laid open my heart to you, because you were so\r\nkind as to take an interest in healing again revolutionary affections,\r\nwhich have ceased in expression only, but not in their existence. God\r\never bless you, and preserve you in life and health.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCIX.--TO JOHN ADAMS, January 21, 1812\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nMonticello, January 21, 1812.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI thank you beforehand (for they are not yet arrived) for the specimens\r\nof homespun you have been so kind as to forward me by post. I doubt not\r\ntheir excellence, knowing how far you are advanced in these things\r\nin your quarter. Here we do little in the fine way, but in coarse\r\nand middling goods a great deal. Every family in the country is a\r\nmanufactory within itself, and is very generally able to make within\r\nitself all the stouter and middling stuffs for its own clothing and\r\nhousehold use. We consider a sheep for every person in the family as\r\nsufficient to clothe it, in addition to the cotton, hemp, and flax,\r\nwhich we raise ourselves. For fine stuff we shall depend on your\r\nnorthern manufactories. Of these, that is to say, of company\r\nestablishments, we have none. We use little machinery. The spinning\r\njenny, and loom with the flying shuttle, can be managed in a family; but\r\nnothing more complicated. The economy and thriftiness resulting from\r\nour household manufactures are such that they will never again be laid\r\naside; and nothing more salutary for us has ever happened than the\r\nBritish obstructions to our demands for their manufactures. Restore free\r\nintercourse when they will, their commerce with us will have totally\r\nchanged its form, and the articles we shall in future want from them\r\nwill not exceed their own consumption of our produce.\r\n\r\nA letter from you calls up recollections very dear to my mind. It\r\ncarries me back to the times when, beset with difficulties and dangers,\r\nwe were fellow-laborers in the same cause, struggling for what is most\r\nvaluable to man, his right of self-government. Laboring always at the\r\nsame oar, with some wave ever ahead threatening to overwhelm us, and yet\r\npassing harmless under our bark, we knew not how, we rode through the\r\nstorm with heart and hand, and made a happy port. Still we did not\r\nexpect to be without rubs and difficulties; and we have had them. First\r\nthe detention of the western posts: then the coalition of Pilnitz,\r\noutlawing our commerce with France, and the British enforcement of the\r\noutlawry. In your day, French depredations: in mine, English, and the\r\nBerlin and Milan decrees: now, the English orders of council, and\r\nthe piracies they authorize. When these shall be over, it will be the\r\nimpressment of our seamen, or something else: and so we have gone on,\r\nand so we shall go on, puzzled and prospering beyond example in\r\nthe history of man. And I do believe we shall continue to growl, to\r\nmultiply, and prosper, until we exhibit an association, powerful, wise,\r\nand happy, beyond what has yet been seen by men. As for France and\r\nEngland, with all their pre-eminence in science, the one is a den of\r\nrobbers, and the other of pirates. And if science produces no better\r\nfruits than tyranny, murder, rapine, and destitution of national\r\nmorality, I would rather wish our country to be ignorant, honest,\r\nand estimable, as our neighboring savages are. But whither is senile\r\ngarrulity leading me? Into politics, of which I have taken final leave.\r\nI think little of them, and say less. I have given up newspapers in\r\nexchange for Tacitus and Thucydides, for Newton and Euclid, and I\r\nfind myself much the happier. Sometimes, indeed, I look back to former\r\noccurrences, in remembrance of our old friends and fellow-laborers,\r\nwho have fallen before us. Of the signers of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, I see now living not more than half a dozen on your side\r\nof the Potomac, and on this side, myself alone. You and I have\r\nbeen wonderfully spared, and myself with remarkable health, and a\r\nconsiderable activity of body and mind. I am on horseback three or four\r\nhours of every day; visit three or four times a year a possession I have\r\nninety miles distant, performing the winter journey on horseback. I walk\r\nlittle, however, a single mile being too much for me; and I live in the\r\nmidst of my grandchildren, one of whom has lately promoted me to be a\r\ngreat-grandfather. I have heard with pleasure that you also retain good\r\nhealth, and a greater power of exercise in walking than I do. But I\r\nwould rather have heard this from yourself, and that, writing a letter\r\nlike mine, full of egotisms, and of details of your health, your habits,\r\noccupations, and enjoyments, I should have the pleasure of knowing, that\r\nin the race of life, you do not keep, in its physical decline, the\r\nsame distance ahead of me, which you have done in political honors and\r\nachievements. No circumstances have lessened the interest I feel in\r\nthese particulars respecting yourself; none have suspended for one\r\nmoment my sincere esteem for you, and I now salute you with unchanged\r\naffection and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER C.--TO JOHN ADAMS, April 20, 1812\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nMonticello, April 20, 1812.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have it now in my power to send you a piece of homespun in return for\r\nthat I received from you. Not of the fine texture, or delicate character\r\nof yours, or, to drop our metaphor, not filled as that was with that\r\ndisplay of imagination which constitutes excellence in Belles Lettres,\r\nbut a mere sober, dry, and formal piece of logic. _Ornari res ipsa\r\nnegat_. Yet you may have enough left of your old taste for law reading,\r\nto cast an eye over some of the questions it discusses. At any rate,\r\naccept it as the offering of esteem and friendship.\r\n\r\nYou wish to know something of the Richmond and Wabash prophets. Of\r\nNimrod Hews I never before heard. Christopher Macpherson I have known\r\nfor twenty years. He is a man of color, brought up as a book-keeper by a\r\nmerchant, his master, and afterwards enfranchised. He had understanding\r\nenough to post up his leger from his journal, but not enough to bear\r\nup against hypochrondriac affections, and the gloomy forebodings they\r\ninspire. He became crazy, foggy, his head always in the clouds, and\r\nrhapsodizing what neither himself nor any one else could understand.\r\nI think he told me he had visited you personally while you were in the\r\nadministration, and wrote you letters, which you have probably forgotten\r\nin the mass of the correspondences of that crazy class, of whose\r\ncomplaints, and terrors, and mysticisms, the several Presidents have\r\nbeen the regular depositories. Macpherson was too honest to be molested\r\nby any body, and too inoffensive to be a subject for the mad-house;\r\nalthough, I believe, we are told in the old book, that ‘every man that\r\nis mad, and maketh himself a prophet, thou shouldst put him in prison\r\nand in the stocks.’\r\n\r\nThe Wabash prophet is a very different character, more rogue than fool,\r\nif to be a rogue is not the greatest of all follies. He arose to notice\r\nwhile I was in the administration, and became, of course, a proper\r\nsubject of inquiry for me. The inquiry was made with diligence. His\r\ndeclared object was the reformation of his red brethren, and their\r\nreturn to their pristine manner of living. He pretended to be in\r\nconstant communication with the Great Spirit; that he was instructed by\r\nhim to make known to the Indians that they were created by him distinct\r\nfrom the whites, of different natures, for different purposes, and\r\nplaced under different circumstances, adapted to their nature and\r\ndestinies; that they must return from all the ways of the whites to the\r\nhabits and opinions of their forefathers; they must not eat the flesh\r\nof hogs, of bullocks, of sheep, &c. the deer and buffalo having been\r\ncreated for their food; they must not make bread of wheat, but of Indian\r\ncorn; they must not wear linen nor woollen, but dress like their fathers\r\nin the skins and furs of animals; they must not drink ardent spirits:\r\nand I do not remember whether he extended his inhibitions to the gun and\r\ngunpowder, in favor of the bow and arrow. I concluded from all this that\r\nhe was a visionary, enveloped in the clouds of their antiquities, and\r\nvainly endeavoring to lead back his brethren to the fancied beatitudes\r\nof their golden age. I thought there was little danger of his making\r\nmany proselytes from the habits and comforts they had learned from the\r\nwhites, to the hardships and privations of savagism, and no great harm\r\nif he did. We let him go on, therefore, unmolested. But his followers\r\nincreased till the English thought him worth corruption, and found him\r\ncorruptible. I suppose his views were then changed; but his proceedings\r\nin consequence of them were after I left the administration, and are,\r\ntherefore, unknown to me; nor have I ever been informed what were the\r\nparticular acts on his part, which produced, an actual commencement\r\nof hostilities on ours. I have no doubt, however, that his subsequent\r\nproceedings are but a chapter apart, like that of Henry and Lord\r\nLiverpool, in the book of the Kings of England.\r\n\r\nOf this mission of Henry, your son had got wind in the time of the\r\nembargo, and communicated it to me. But he had learned nothing of the\r\nparticular agent, although, of his workings, the information he had\r\nobtained appears now to have been correct. He stated a particular which\r\nHenry has not distinctly brought forward, which was, that the eastern\r\nStates were not to be required to make a formal act of separation from\r\nthe Union, and to take a part in the war against it; a measure deemed\r\nmuch too strong for their people: but to declare themselves in a state\r\nof neutrality, in consideration of which they were to have peace and\r\nfree commerce, the lure most likely to insure popular acquiescence.\r\nHaving no indications of Henry as the intermediate in this negotiation\r\nof the Essex junto, suspicions fell on Pickering, and his nephew\r\nWilliams in London. If he was wronged in this, the ground of the\r\nsuspicion is to be found in his known practices and avowed opinions,\r\nas that of his accomplices in the sameness of sentiment and of language\r\nwith Henry, and subsequently by the fluttering of the wounded pigeons.\r\n\r\nThis letter, with what it encloses, has given you enough, I presume, of\r\nlaw and the prophets. I will only add to it, therefore, the homage of my\r\nrespects to Mrs. Adams, and to yourself the assurances of affectionate\r\nesteem and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CI.--TO JAMES MAURY, April 25, 1812\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MAURY.\r\n\r\nMonticello, April 25, 1812.\r\n\r\nMy Dear and Ancient Friend and Classmate,\r\n\r\nOften has my heart smote me for delaying acknowledgments to you,\r\nreceiving, as I do, such frequent proofs of your kind recollection in\r\nthe transmission of papers to me. But instead of acting on the good old\r\nmaxim of not putting off to to-morrow what we can do to-day, we are too\r\napt to reverse it, and not to do today what we can put off to to-morrow.\r\nBut this duty can be no longer put off. To-day we are at peace;\r\nto-morrow war. The curtain of separation is drawing between us, and\r\nprobably will not be withdrawn till one, if not both of us, will be at\r\nrest with our fathers. Let me now, then, while I may, renew to you the\r\ndeclarations of my warm attachment, which in no period of life has ever\r\nbeen weakened, and seems to become stronger as the remaining objects of\r\nour youthful affections are fewer.\r\n\r\nOur two countries are to be at war, but not you and I. And why should\r\nour two countries be at war, when by peace we can be so much more useful\r\nto one another? Surely the world will acquit our government of having\r\nsought it. Never before has there been an instance of a nation’s bearing\r\nso much as we have borne. Two items alone in our catalogue of wrongs\r\nwill for ever acquit us of being the aggressors; the impressment of our\r\nseamen, and the excluding us from the ocean. The first foundations of\r\nthe social compact would be broken up, were we definitively to refuse to\r\nits members the protection of their persons and property, while in their\r\nlawful pursuits. I think the war will not be short, because the object\r\nof England, long obvious, is to claim the ocean as her domain, and to\r\nexact transit duties from every vessel traversing it. This is the sum of\r\nher orders of council, which were only a step in this bold experiment,\r\nnever meant to be retracted if it could be permanently maintained. And\r\nthis object must continue her in war with all the world. To this I\r\nsee no termination, until her exaggerated efforts, so much beyond her\r\nnatural strength and resources, shall have exhausted her to bankruptcy.\r\nThe approach of this crisis is, I think, visible in the departure of her\r\nprecious metals, and depreciation of her paper medium. We, who have gone\r\nthrough that operation, know its symptoms, its course, and consequences.\r\nIn England they will be more serious than elsewhere, because half the\r\nwealth of her people is now in that medium, the private revenue of her\r\nmoney-holders, or rather of her paper-holders, being, I believe, greater\r\nthan that of her land-holders. Such a proportion of property, imaginary\r\nand baseless as it is, cannot be reduced to vapor, but with great\r\nexplosion. She will rise out of its ruins, however, because her lands,\r\nher houses, her arts, will remain, and the greater part of her men. And\r\nthese will give her again that place among nations which is proportioned\r\nto her natural means, and which we all wish her to hold. We believe that\r\nthe just standing of all nations is the health and security of all. We\r\nconsider the overwhelming power of England on the ocean, and of France\r\non the land, as destructive of the prosperity and happiness of the\r\nworld, and wish both to be reduced only to the necessity of observing\r\nmoral duties. We believe no more in Bonaparte’s fighting merely for the\r\nliberty of the seas, than in Great Britain’s fighting for the liberties\r\nof mankind. The object of both is the same, to draw to themselves the\r\npower, the wealth, and the resources of other nations. We resist the\r\nenterprises of England first, because they first come vitally home to\r\nus. And our feelings repel the logic of bearing the lash of George the\r\nIII. for fear of that of Bonaparte at some future day. When the wrongs\r\nof France shall reach us with equal effect, we shall resist them\r\nalso. But one at a time is enough: and having offered a choice to the\r\nchampions, England first takes up the gauntlet.\r\n\r\nThe English newspapers suppose me the personal enemy of their nation. I\r\nam not so. I am an enemy to its injuries, as I am to those of France. If\r\nI could permit myself to have national partialities, and if the conduct\r\nof England would have permitted them to be directed towards her,\r\nthey would have been so. I thought that, in the administration of Mr.\r\nAddington, I discovered some dispositions towards justice, and even\r\nfriendship and respect for us, and began to pave the way for cherishing\r\nthese dispositions, and improving them into ties of mutual good will.\r\nBut we had then a federal minister there, whose dispositions to believe\r\nhimself, and to inspire others with a belief, in our sincerity, his\r\nsubsequent conduct has brought into doubt; and poor Merry, the English\r\nminister here, had learned nothing of diplomacy but its suspicions,\r\nwithout head enough to distinguish when they were misplaced. Mr.\r\nAddington and Mr. Fox passed away too soon to avail the two countries\r\nof their dispositions. Had I been personally hostile to England,\r\nand biassed in favor of either the character or views of her great\r\nantagonist, the affair of the Chesapeake put war into my hand. I had\r\nonly to open it, and let havoc loose. But if ever I was gratified\r\nwith the possession of power, and of the confidence of those who had\r\nentrusted me with it, it was on that occasion, when I was enabled to\r\nuse both for the prevention of war, towards which the torrent of passion\r\nhere was directed almost irresistibly, and when not another person in\r\nthe United States, less supported by authority and favor, could have\r\nresisted it. And now that a definitive adherence to her impressments and\r\norders of council renders war no longer avoidable, my earnest prayer is,\r\nthat our government may enter into no compact of common cause with the\r\nother belligerent, but keep us free to make a separate peace, whenever\r\nEngland will separately give us peace, and future security. But Lord\r\nLiverpool is our witness, that this can never be but by her removal from\r\nour neighborhood.\r\n\r\nI have thus, for a moment, taken a range into the field of politics,\r\nto possess you with the view we take of things here. But in the scenes\r\nwhich are to ensue, I am to be but a spectator. I have withdrawn myself\r\nfrom all political intermeddlings, to indulge the evening of my life\r\nwith what have been the passions of every portion of it, books, science,\r\nmy farms, my family, and friends.\r\n\r\nTo these every hour of the day is now devoted. I retain a good activity\r\nof mind, not quite as much of body, but uninterrupted health. Still the\r\nhand of age is upon me. All my old friends are nearly gone. Of those in\r\nmy neighborhood, Mr. Divers and Mr. Lindsay alone remain. If you could\r\nmake it a _partie quarrée_, it would be a comfort indeed. We would\r\nbeguile our lingering hours with talking over our youthful exploits, our\r\nhunts on Peter’s Mountain, with a long train of _et cetera_ in addition,\r\nand feel, by recollection at least, a momentary flash of youth.\r\nReviewing the course of a long and sufficiently successful life, I find\r\nin no portion of it happier moments than those were. I think the old\r\nhulk in which you are, is near her wreck, and that like a prudent rat,\r\nyou should escape in time. However, here, there, and every where, in\r\npeace or in war, you will have my sincere affections, and prayers for\r\nyour life, health, and happiness.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CII.--TO THE PRESIDENT, May 30, 1812\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nMonticello, May 30, 1812.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nAnother communication is enclosed, and the letter of the applicant is\r\nthe only information I have of his qualifications. I barely remember\r\nsuch a person as the secretary of Mr. Adams, and messenger to the Senate\r\nwhile I was of that body. It enlarges the sphere of choice by adding\r\nto it a strong federalist. The triangular war must be the idea of the\r\nAnglomen and malcontents; in other words, the federalists and quids. Yet\r\nit would reconcile neither. It would only change the topic of abuse\r\nwith the former, and not cure the mental disease of the latter. It\r\nwould prevent our eastern capitalists and seamen from employment in\r\nprivateering, take away the only chance of conciliating them, and keep\r\nthem at home, idle, to swell the discontents; it would completely disarm\r\nus of the most powerful weapon we can employ against Great Britain, by\r\nshutting every port to our prizes, and yet would not add a single\r\nvessel to their number; it would shut every market to our agricultural\r\nproductions, and engender impatience and discontent with that class\r\nwhich, in fact, composes the nation; it would insulate us in general\r\nnegotiations for peace, making all the parties our opposers, and very\r\nindifferent about peace with us, if they have it with the rest of the\r\nworld; and would exhibit a solecism worthy of Don Quixotte only, that\r\nof a choice to fight two enemies at a time, rather than to take them\r\nby succession. And the only motive for all this is a sublimated\r\nimpartiality, at which the world will laugh, and our own people will\r\nturn upon us in mass as soon as it is explained to them, as it will be\r\nby the very persons who are now laying that snare. These are the hasty\r\nviews of one who rarely thinks on these subjects. Your own will\r\nbe better, and I pray to them every success, and to yourself every\r\nfelicity.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CIII.--TO ELBRIDGE GERRY, June 11, 1812\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ELBRIDGE GERRY.\r\n\r\nMonticello, June 11, 1812.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nIt has given me great pleasure to receive a letter from you. It seems as\r\nif, our ancient friends dying off, the whole mass of the affections\r\nof the heart survives undiminished to the few who remain. I think our\r\nacquaintance commenced in 1764, both then just of age. We happened to\r\ntake lodgings in the same house in New York. Our next meeting was in\r\nthe Congress of 1775, and at various times afterwards in the exercise of\r\nthat and other public functions, until your mission to Europe. Since we\r\nhave ceased to meet, we have still thought and acted together, ‘_et idem\r\nvelle, atque idem nolle, ea demum amicitia est_.’ Of this harmony of\r\nprinciple, the papers you enclosed me are proof sufficient. I do not\r\ncondole with you on your release from your government. The vote of your\r\nopponents is the most honorable mark by which the soundness of your\r\nconduct could be stamped. I claim the same honorable testimonial. There\r\nwas but a single act of my whole administration of which that party\r\napproved. That was the proclamation on the attack of the Chesapeake.\r\nAnd when I found they approved of it, I confess I began strongly to\r\napprehend I had done wrong, and to exclaim with the Psalmist, ‘Lord,\r\nwhat have I done, that the wicked should praise me!’\r\n\r\nWhat, then, does this English faction with you mean? Their newspapers\r\nsay rebellion, and that they will not remain united with us unless we\r\nwill permit them to govern the majority. If this be their purpose, their\r\nanti-republican spirit, it ought to be met at once. But a government\r\nlike ours should be slow in believing this, should put forth its whole\r\nmight when necessary to suppress it, and promptly return to the paths of\r\nreconciliation. The extent of our country secures it, I hope, from the\r\nvindictive passions of the petty incorporations of Greece. I rather\r\nsuspect that the principal office of the other seventeen States will be\r\nto moderate and restrain the local excitement of our friends with you,\r\nwhen they (with the aid of their brethren of the other States, if they\r\nneed it) shall have brought the rebellious to their feet. They count on\r\nBritish aid. But what can that avail them by land? They would separate\r\nfrom their friends, who alone furnish employment for their navigation,\r\nto unite with their only rival for that employment. When interdicted\r\nthe harbors of their quondam brethren, they will go, I suppose, to ask\r\na share in the carrying-trade of their rivals, and a dispensation with\r\ntheir navigation act. They think they will be happier in an association\r\nunder the rulers of Ireland, the East and West Indies, than in an\r\nindependent government, where they are obliged to put up with their\r\nproportional share only in the direction of its affairs. But I trust\r\nthat such perverseness will not be that of the honest and well meaning\r\nmass of the federalists of Massachusetts; and that when the questions\r\nof separation and rebellion shall be nakedly proposed to them, the Gores\r\nand the Pickerings will find their levees crowded with silk-stocking\r\ngentry, but no yeomanry; an army of officers without soldiers. I hope,\r\nthen, all will still end well: the Anglomen will consent to make peace\r\nwith their bread and butter, and you and I shall sink to rest, without\r\nhaving been actors or spectators in another civil war.\r\n\r\nHow many children have you? You beat me, I expect, in that count; but I\r\nyou in that of our grand-children. We have not timed these things well\r\ntogether, or we might have begun a re-alliance between Massachusetts\r\nand the Old Dominion, faithful companions in the war of Independence,\r\npeculiarly tallied in interests, by each wanting exactly what the other\r\nhas to spare; and estranged to each other, in latter times, only by the\r\npractices of a third nation, the common enemy of both. Let us live only\r\nto see this re-union, and I will say with old Simeon, ‘Lord, now\r\nlettest thou thy servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen thy\r\nsalvation.’ In that peace may you long remain, my friend, and depart\r\nonly in the fulness of years, all passed in health and prosperity. God\r\nbless you.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. June 13. I did not condole with you on the reprobation of your\r\nopponents, because it proved your orthodoxy. Yesterday’s post brought\r\nme the resolution of the republicans of Congress, to propose you as\r\nVice-President. On this I sincerely congratulate you. It is a stamp of\r\ndouble proof. It is a notification to the factionaries that their nay is\r\nthe yea of truth, and its best test. We shall be almost within striking\r\ndistance of each other. Who knows but you may fill up some short recess\r\nof Congress with a visit to Monticello, where a numerous family will\r\nhail you with a hearty country welcome. T.J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CIV.--TO JUDGE TYLER, June 17,1812\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JUDGE TYLER.\r\n\r\nMonticello, June 17,1812.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nOn the other subject of your letter, the application of the common law\r\nto our present situation, I deride with you the ordinary doctrine,\r\nthat we brought with us from England the common law rights. This narrow\r\nnotion was a favorite in the first moment of rallying to our rights\r\nagainst Great Britain. But it was that of men who felt their rights\r\nbefore they had thought of their explanation. The truth is, that we\r\nbrought with us the rights of men; of expatriated men. On our arrival\r\nhere, the question would at once arise, by what law will we govern\r\nourselves? The resolution seems to have been, by that system with which\r\nwe are familiar, to be altered by ourselves occasionally, and adapted to\r\nour new situation. The proofs of this resolution are to be found in\r\nthe form of the oaths of the judges, 1 Hening’s Stat. 169, 187; of the\r\nGovernor, ib. 504; in the act for a provisional government, ib. 372; in\r\nthe preamble to the laws of 1661-2; the uniform current of opinions and\r\ndecisions; and in the general recognition of all our statutes framed\r\non that basis. But the state of the English law at the date of\r\nour emigration, constituted the system adopted here. We may doubt,\r\ntherefore, the propriety of quoting in our courts English authorities\r\nsubsequent to that adoption; still more, the admission of authorities\r\nposterior to the Declaration of Independence, or rather to the accession\r\nof that King, whose reign, _ab initio_, was that very tissue of wrongs\r\nwhich rendered the Declaration at length necessary. The reason for it\r\nhad inception at least as far back as the commencement of his reign.\r\nThis relation to the beginning of his reign, would add the advantage of\r\ngetting us rid of all Mansfield’s innovations, or civilizations of the\r\ncommon law. For however I admit the superiority of the civil, over the\r\ncommon law code, as a system of perfect justice, yet an incorporation of\r\nthe two would be like Nebuchadnezzar’s image of metals and clay, a thing\r\nwithout cohesion of parts. The only natural improvement of the common\r\nlaw, is through its homogeneous ally, the chancery, in which new\r\nprinciples are to be examined, concocted, and digested. But when,\r\nby repeated decisions and modifications, they are rendered pure and\r\ncertain, they should be transferred by statute to the courts of common\r\nlaw, and placed within the pale of juries. The exclusion from the courts\r\nof the malign influence of all authorities after the _Georgium sidus_\r\nbecame ascendant, would uncanonize Blackstone, whose book, although the\r\nmost elegant and best digested of our law catalogue, has been perverted\r\nmore than all others to the degeneracy of legal science. A student finds\r\nthere a smattering of every thing, and his indolence easily persuades\r\nhim, that if he understands that book, he is master of the whole body\r\nof the law. The distinction between these and those who have drawn their\r\nstores from the deep and rich mines of Coke’s Littleton, seems\r\nwell understood even by the unlettered common people, who apply the\r\nappellation of Blackstone-lawyers to these ephemeral insects of the law.\r\n\r\nWhether we should undertake to reduce the common law, our own, and\r\nso much of the English statutes as we have adopted, to a text, is a\r\nquestion of transcendant difficulty. It was discussed at the first\r\nmeeting of the committee of the revised code, in 1776, and decided\r\nin the negative, by the opinions of Wythe, Mason, and myself, against\r\nPendleton and Thomas Lee. Pendleton proposed to take Blackstone for that\r\ntext, only purging him of what was inapplicable, or unsuitable to us. In\r\nthat case, the meaning of every word of Blackstone would have become\r\na source of litigation, until it had been settled by repeated legal\r\ndecisions. And to come at that meaning, we should have had produced, on\r\nall occasions, that very pile of authorities from which it would be said\r\nhe drew his conclusion, and which, of course, would explain it, and\r\nthe terms in which it is couched. Thus we should have retained the same\r\nchaos of law-lore from which we wished to be emancipated, added to the\r\nevils of the uncertainty which a new text and new phrases would have\r\ngenerated. An example of this may be found in the old statutes, and\r\ncommentaries on them, in Coke’s second institute; but more remarkably,\r\nin the institute of Justinian, and the vast masses, explanatory or\r\nsupplementary of that, which fill the libraries of the civilians. We\r\nwere deterred from the attempt by these considerations, added to which,\r\nthe bustle of the times did not permit leisure for such an undertaking.\r\n\r\nYour request of my opinion on this subject has given you the trouble of\r\nthese observations. If your firmer mind in encountering difficulties,\r\nwould have added your vote to the minority of the committee, you would\r\nhave had on your side one of the greatest men of our age, and, like him,\r\nhave detracted nothing from the sentiments of esteem and respect which I\r\nbore to him, and tender with sincerity the assurance of to yourself.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CV.--TO COLONEL WILLIAM DUANE, October 1, 1812\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL WILLIAM DUANE.\r\n\r\nMonticello, October 1, 1812.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of September the 20th has been duly received, and I cannot\r\nbut be gratified by the assurance it expresses, that my aid in the\r\ncouncils of our government would increase the public confidence in them;\r\nbecause it admits an inference that they have approved of the course\r\npursued, when I heretofore bore a part in those councils. I profess,\r\ntoo, so much of the Roman principle, as to deem it honorable for the\r\ngeneral of yesterday to act as a corporal to-day, if his services can be\r\nuseful to his country; holding that to be false pride, which postpones\r\nthe public good to any private or personal considerations. But I am\r\npast service. The hand of age is upon me. The decay of bodily faculties\r\napprizes me that those of the mind cannot be unimpaired, had I not still\r\nbetter proofs. Every year counts by increased debility, and departing\r\nfaculties keep the score. The last year it was the sight, this it is the\r\nhearing, the next something else will be going, until all is gone.\r\nOf all this I was sensible before I left Washington, and probably my\r\nfellow-laborers saw it before I did. The decay of memory was obvious:\r\nit is now become distressing. But the mind, too, is weakened. When I\r\nwas young, mathematics was the passion of my life. The same passion has\r\nreturned upon me, but with unequal powers. Processes which I then read\r\noff with the facility of common discourse, now cost me labor, and time,\r\nand slow investigation. When I offered this, therefore, as one of the\r\nreasons deciding my retirement from office, it was offered in sincerity\r\nand a consciousness of its truth. And I think it a great blessing that\r\nI retain understanding enough to be sensible how much of it I have lost,\r\nand to avoid exposing myself as a spectacle for the pity of my friends;\r\nthat I have surmounted the difficult point of knowing when to retire. As\r\na compensation for faculties departed, nature gives me good health, and\r\na perfect resignation to the laws of decay which she has prescribed to\r\nall the forms and combinations of matter.\r\n\r\nThe detestable treason of Hull has, indeed, excited a deep anxiety\r\nin all breasts. The depression was in the first moment gloomy and\r\nportentous. But it has been succeeded by a revived animation, and a\r\ndetermination to meet the occurrence with increased efforts; and I have\r\nso much confidence in the vigorous minds and bodies of our countrymen,\r\nas to be fearless as to the final issue. The treachery of Hull, like\r\nthat of Arnold, cannot be matter of blame on our government. His\r\ncharacter, as an officer of skill and bravery, was established on the\r\ntrials of the last war, and no previous act of his life had led to doubt\r\nhis fidelity. Whether the Head of the war department is equal to his\r\ncharge, I am not qualified to decide. I knew him only as a pleasant,\r\ngentlemanly man in society; and the indecision of his character rather\r\nadded to the amenity of his conversation. But when translated from\r\nthe colloquial circle to the great stage of national concerns, and the\r\ndirection of the extensive operations of war, whether he has been able\r\nto seize at one glance the long line of defenceless border presented by\r\nour enemy, the masses of strength which we hold on different points of\r\nit, the facility this gave us of attacking him, on the same day, on\r\nall his points, from the extremity of the lakes to the neighborhood\r\nof Quebec, and the perfect indifference with which this last place,\r\nimpregnable as it is, might be left in the hands of the enemy to fall\r\nof itself; whether, I say, he could see and prepare vigorously for\r\nall this, or merely wrapped himself in the cloak of cold defence, I\r\nam uninformed. I clearly think with you on the competence of Monroe\r\nto embrace great views of action. The decision of his character, his\r\nenterprise, firmness, industry, and unceasing vigilance, would, I\r\nbelieve, secure, as I am sure they would merit, the public confidence,\r\nand give us all the success which our means can accomplish. If our\r\noperations have suffered or languished from any want of energy in the\r\npresent head which directs them, I have so much confidence in the wisdom\r\nand conscientious integrity of Mr. Madison, as to be satisfied, that,\r\nhowever torturing to his feelings, he will fulfil his duty to the public\r\nand to his own reputation, by making the necessary change. Perhaps he\r\nmay be preparing it while we are talking about it: for of all these\r\nthings I am uninformed. I fear that Hull’s surrender has been more than\r\nthe mere loss of a year to us. Besides bringing on us the whole mass of\r\nsavage nations, whom fear and not affection had kept in quiet, there is\r\ndanger that in giving time to an enemy who can send reinforcements of\r\nregulars faster than we can raise them, they may strengthen Canada and\r\nHalifax beyond the assailment of our lax and divided powers. Perhaps,\r\nhowever, the patriotic efforts from Kentucky and Ohio, by recalling\r\nthe British force to its upper posts, may yet give time to Dearborn to\r\nstrike a blow below. Effectual possession of the river from Montreal to\r\nthe Chaudiere, which is practicable, would give us the upper country\r\nat our leisure, and close for ever the scenes of the tomahawk and\r\nscalping-knife.\r\n\r\nBut these things are for others to plan and achieve. The only succor\r\nfrom the old, must lie in their prayers. These I offer up with sincere\r\ndevotion; and in my concern for the great public, I do not overlook my\r\nfriends, but supplicate for them, as I do for yourself, a long course of\r\nfreedom, happiness, and prosperity.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CVI.--TO MR. MELISH, January 13, 1813\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. MELISH.\r\n\r\nMonticello, January 13, 1813.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI received duly your favor of December the 15th, and with it the copies\r\nof your map and travels, for which be pleased to accept my thanks. The\r\nbook I have read with extreme satisfaction and information. As to the\r\nwestern States, particularly, it has greatly edified me; for of the\r\nactual condition of that interesting portion of our country, I had not\r\nan adequate idea. I feel myself now as familiar with it as with the\r\ncondition of the maritime States. I had no conception that manufactures\r\nhad made such progress there, and particularly of the number of carding\r\nand spinning machines dispersed through the whole country. We are\r\nbut beginning here to have them in our private families. Small\r\nspinning-jennies of from half a dozen to twenty spindles, will soon,\r\nhowever, make their way into the humblest cottages, as well as the\r\nrichest houses; and nothing is more certain, than that the coarse and\r\nmiddling clothing for our families, will for ever hereafter continue to\r\nbe made within ourselves. I have hitherto myself depended entirely on\r\nforeign manufactures: but I have now thirty-five spindles a going, a\r\nhand carding-machine, and looms with the flying shuttle, for the supply\r\nof my own farms, which will never be relinquished in my time. The\r\ncontinuance of the war will fix the habit generally, and out of the\r\nevils of impressment and of the orders of council, a great blessing\r\nfor us will grow. I have not formerly been an advocate for great\r\nmanufactories. I doubted whether our labor, employed in agriculture,\r\nand aided by the spontaneous energies of the earth, would not procure\r\nus more than we could make ourselves of other necessaries. But other\r\nconsiderations entering into the question, have settled my doubts.\r\n\r\nThe candor with which you have viewed the manners and condition of our\r\ncitizens, is so unlike the narrow prejudices of the French and English\r\ntravellers preceding you, who, considering each the manners and habits\r\nof their own people as the only orthodox, have viewed every thing\r\ndiffering from that test as boorish and barbarous, that your work will\r\nbe read here extensively, and operate great good.\r\n\r\nAmidst this mass of approbation which is given to every other part of\r\nthe work, there is a single sentiment which I cannot help wishing to\r\nbring to what I think the correct one; and, on a point so interesting,\r\nI value your opinion too highly not to ambition its concurrence with\r\nmy own. Stating in volume first, page sixty-third, the principle of\r\ndifference between the two great political parties here, you conclude\r\nit to be, ‘whether the controlling power shall be vested in this or that\r\nset of men.’ That each party endeavors to get into the administration of\r\nthe government, and to exclude the other from power, is true, and may\r\nbe stated as a motive of action: but this is only secondary; the primary\r\nmotive being a real and radical difference of political principle. I\r\nsincerely wish our differences were but personally who should govern\r\nand that the principles of our constitution were those of both parties.\r\nUnfortunately, it is otherwise; and the question of preference between\r\nmonarchy and republicanism, which has so long divided mankind elsewhere,\r\nthreatens a permanent division here.\r\n\r\nAmong that section of our citizens called federalists, there are three\r\nshades of opinion. Distinguishing between the leaders and people who\r\ncompose it, the leaders consider the English constitution as a model of\r\nperfection, some, with a correction of its vices, others, with all its\r\ncorruptions and abuses. This last was Alexander Hamilton’s opinion,\r\nwhich others, as well as myself, have often heard him declare, and that\r\na correction of what are called its vices, would render the English\r\nan impracticable government.. This government they wished to have\r\nestablished here, and only accepted and held fast, at first, to the\r\npresent constitution, as a stepping-stone to the final establishment of\r\ntheir favorite model. This party has therefore always clung to England,\r\nas their prototype, and great auxiliary in promoting and effecting this\r\nchange. A weighty minority, however, of these leaders, considering the\r\nvoluntary conversion of our government into a monarchy as too distant,\r\nif not desperate, wish to break off from our Union its eastern fragment,\r\nas being, in truth, the hot-bed of American monarchism, with a view to a\r\ncommencement of their favorite government, from whence the other States\r\nmay gangrene by degrees, and the whole be thus brought finally to the\r\ndesired point. For Massachusetts, the prime mover in this enterprise, is\r\nthe last State in the Union to mean a final separation, as being of all\r\nthe most dependant on the others. Not raising bread for the sustenance\r\nher own inhabitants, not having a stick of timber for the construction\r\nof vessels, her principal occupation, nor an article to export in them,\r\nwhere would she be, excluded from the ports of the other States, and\r\nthrown into dependance on England, her direct and natural, but now\r\ninsidious, rival? At the head of this minority is what is called the\r\nEssex Junto of Massachusetts. But the majority of these leaders do not\r\naim at separation. In this they adhere to the known principle of\r\nGeneral Hamilton, never, under any views, to break the Union. Anglomany,\r\nmonarchy, and separation, then, are the principles of the Essex\r\nfederalists; Anglomany and monarchy, those of the Hamiltonians,\r\nand Anglomany alone, that of the portion among the people who call\r\nthemselves federalists. These last are as good republicans as the\r\nbrethren whom they oppose, and differ from them only in the devotion\r\nto England and hatred of France, which they have imbibed from their\r\nleaders. The moment that these leaders should avowedly propose a\r\nseparation of the Union, or the establishment of regal government, their\r\npopular adherents would quit them to a man, and join the republican\r\nstandard; and the partisans of this change, even in Massachusetts, would\r\nthus find themselves an army of officers without a soldier.\r\n\r\nThe party called republican is steadily for the support of the present\r\nconstitution. They obtained, at its commencement, all the amendments to\r\nit they desired. These reconciled them to it perfectly, and if they have\r\nany ulterior view, it is only, perhaps, to popularize it further,\r\nby shortening the Senatorial term, and devising a process for the\r\nresponsibility of judges, more practicable than that of impeachment.\r\nThey esteem the people of England and France equally, and equally detest\r\nthe governing powers of both.\r\n\r\nThis I verily believe, after an intimacy of forty years with the public\r\ncouncils and characters, is a true statement of the grounds on which\r\nthey are at present divided, and that it is not merely an ambition for\r\npower. An honest man can feel no pleasure in the exercise of power over\r\nhis fellow-citizens. And considering as the only offices of power those\r\nconferred by the people directly, that is to say, the executive and\r\nlegislative functions of the General and State governments, the common\r\nrefusal of these, and multiplied resignations, are proofs sufficient\r\nthat power is not alluring to pure minds, and is not, with them, the\r\nprimary principle of contest. This is my belief of it; it is that\r\non which I have acted; and had it been a mere contest who should\r\nbe permitted to administer the government according to its genuine\r\nrepublican principles, there has never been a moment of my life, in\r\nwhich I should not have relinquished for it the enjoyments of my family,\r\nmy farm, my friends, and books.\r\n\r\nYou expected to discover the difference of our party principles in\r\nGeneral Washington’s Valedictory, and my Inaugural Address. Not at all.\r\nGeneral Washington did not harbor one principle of federalism. He was\r\nneither an Angloman, a monarchist, nor a separatist. He sincerely wished\r\nthe people to have as much self-government as they were competent to\r\nexercise themselves. The only point in which he and I ever differed\r\nin opinion, was, that I had more confidence than he had in the natural\r\nintegrity and discretion of the people, and in the safety and extent to\r\nwhich they might trust themselves with a control over their government.\r\nHe has asseverated to me a thousand times his determination that the\r\nexisting government should have a fair trial, and that in support of\r\nit he would spend the last drop of his blood. He did this the more\r\nrepeatedly, because he knew General Hamilton’s political bias, and\r\nmy apprehensions from it. It is a mere calumny, therefore, in the\r\nmonarchists, to associate General Washington with their principles.\r\nBut that may have happened in this case which has been often seen in\r\nordinary cases, that, by often repeating an untruth, men come to\r\nbelieve it themselves. It is a mere artifice in this party, to bolster\r\nthemselves up on the revered name of that first of our worthies. If\r\nI have dwelt longer on this subject than was necessary, it proves the\r\nestimation in which I hold your ultimate opinions, and my desire of\r\nplacing the subject truly before them. In so doing, I am certain I risk\r\nno use of the communication which may draw me into contention before the\r\npublic. Tranquillity is the _summum bonum_ of a _Septagénaire_.\r\n\r\nTo return to the merits of your work; I consider it as so lively a\r\npicture of the real state of our country, that if I can possibly obtain\r\nopportunities of conveyance, I propose to send a copy to a friend in\r\nFrance, and another to one in Italy, who, I know, will translate\r\nand circulate it as an antidote to the misrepresentations of former\r\ntravellers. But whatever effect my profession of political faith may\r\nhave on your general opinion, a part of my object will be obtained, if\r\nit satisfies you as to the principles of my own action, and of the high\r\nrespect and consideration with which I tender you my salutations.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CVII.--TO MADAME LA BARONNE DE STAEL-HOLSTEIN, May 24, 1818\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MADAME LA BARONNE DE STAEL-HOLSTEIN.\r\n\r\nUnited States of America,\r\n\r\nMay 24, 1818.\r\n\r\nI received with great pleasure, my dear Madam and friend, your letter\r\nof November the 10th, from Stockholm, and am sincerely gratified by the\r\noccasion it gives me of expressing to you the sentiments of high respect\r\nand esteem which I entertain for you. It recalls to my remembrance a\r\nhappy portion of my life, passed in your native city; then the seat\r\nof the most amiable and polished society of the world, and of which\r\nyourself and your venerable father were such distinguished members. But\r\nof what scenes has it since been the theatre, and with what havoc has\r\nit overspread the earth! Robespierre met the fate, and his memory\r\nthe execration, he so justly merited. The rich were his victims, and\r\nperished by thousands. It is by millions that Bonaparte destroys\r\nthe poor, and he is eulogized and deified by the sycophants--even of\r\nscience. These merit more than the mere oblivion to which they will\r\nbe consigned; and the day will come when a just posterity will give to\r\ntheir hero the only pre-eminence he has earned, that of having been the\r\ngreatest of the destroyers of the human race. What year of his military\r\nlife has not consigned a million of human beings to death, to poverty,\r\nand wretchedness? What field in Europe may not raise a monument of the\r\nmurders, the burnings, the desolations, the famines, and miseries, it\r\nhas witnessed from him! And all this to acquire a reputation, which\r\nCartouche attained with less injury to mankind, of being fearless of God\r\nor man.\r\n\r\nTo complete and universalize the desolation of the globe, it has been\r\nthe will of Providence to raise up, at the same time, a tyrant as\r\nunprincipled and as overwhelming, for the ocean. Not in the poor maniac\r\nGeorge, but in his government and nation. Bonaparte will die, and his\r\ntyrannies with him. But a nation never dies. The English government and\r\nits piratical principles and practices, have no fixed term of duration.\r\nEurope feels, and is writhing under the scorpion whips of Bonaparte. We\r\nare assailed by those of England. The one continent thus placed under\r\nthe gripe of England, and the other of Bonaparte, each has to grapple\r\nwith the enemy immediately pressing on itself. We must extinguish the\r\nfire kindled in our own house, and leave to our friends beyond the water\r\nthat which is consuming theirs. It was not till England had taken one\r\nthousand of our ships, and impressed into her service more than six\r\nthousand of our citizens; till she had declared, by the proclamation of\r\nher Prince Regent, that she would not repeal her aggressive orders as to\r\nus, until Bonaparte should have repealed his as to all nations; till her\r\nminister, in formal conference with ours, declared, that no proposition\r\nfor protecting our seamen from being impressed, under color of taking\r\ntheir own, was practicable or admissible; that, the door to justice and\r\nto all amicable arrangement being closed, and negotiation become both\r\ndesperate and dishonorable, we concluded that the war she had been for\r\nyears waging against us, might as well become a war on both sides. She\r\ntakes fewer vessels from us since the declaration of war than before,\r\nbecause they venture more cautiously; and we now make full reprisals\r\nwhere before we made none. England is, in principle, the enemy of all\r\nmaritime nations, as Bonaparte is of the continental; and I place in\r\nthe same line of insult to the human understanding, the pretension\r\nof conquering the ocean, to establish continental rights, as that of\r\nconquering the continent, to restore maritime rights. No, my dear Madam;\r\nthe object of England is the permanent dominion of the ocean, and the\r\nmonopoly of the trade of the world. To secure this, she must keep a\r\nlarger fleet than her own resources will maintain. The resources of\r\nother nations, then, must be impressed to supply the deficiency of her\r\nown. This is sufficiently developed and evidenced by her successive\r\nstrides towards the usurpation of the sea. Mark them, from her first war\r\nafter William Pitt, the little, came into her administration. She first\r\nforbade to neutrals all trade with her enemies in time of war, which\r\nthey had not in time of peace. This deprived them of their trade from\r\nport to port of the same nation. Then she forbade them to trade from\r\nthe port of one nation to that of any other at war with her, although a\r\nright fully exercised in time of peace. Next, instead of taking vessels\r\nonly entering a blockaded port, she took them over the whole ocean, if\r\ndestined to that port, although ignorant of the blockade, and without\r\nintention to violate it. Then she took them returning from that port,\r\nas if infected by previous infraction of blockade. Then came her paper\r\nblockades, by which she might shut up the whole world without sending\r\na ship to sea, except to take all those sailing on it, as they must, of\r\ncourse, be bound to some port. And these were followed by her orders of\r\ncouncil, forbidding every nation to go to the port of any other, without\r\ncoming first to some port of Great Britain, there paying a tribute to\r\nher, regulated by the cargo, and taking from her a license to proceed to\r\nthe port of destination; which operation the vessel was to repeat with\r\nthe return cargo on its way home. According to these orders, we could\r\nnot send a vessel from St. Mary’s to St. Augustine, distant six hour’s\r\nsail, on our own coast, without crossing the Atlantic four times, twice\r\nwith the outward cargo, and twice with the inward. She found this\r\ntoo daring and outrageous for a single step, retracted as to certain\r\narticles of commerce, but left it in force as to others which constitute\r\nimportant branches of our exports. And finally, that her views may no\r\nlonger rest on inference, in a recent debate, her minister declared in\r\nopen parliament, that the object of the present war is a monopoly of\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nIn some of these atrocities, France kept pace with her fully in\r\nspeculative wrong, which her impotence only shortened in practical\r\nexecution. This was called retaliation by both; each charging the other\r\nwith the initiation of the outrage. As if two combatants might retaliate\r\non an innocent bystander, the blows they received from each other. To\r\nmake war on both would have been ridiculous. In order, therefore, to\r\nsingle out an enemy, we offered to both, that if either would revoke\r\nits hostile decrees, and the other should refuse, we would interdict all\r\nintercourse whatever with that other; which would be war of course, as\r\nbeing an avowed departure from neutrality. France accepted the offer,\r\nand revoked her decrees as to us. England not only refused, but declared\r\nby a solemn proclamation of her Prince Regent, that she would not revoke\r\nher orders even as to us, until those of France should be annulled as to\r\nthe whole world. We thereon declared war, and with abundant additional\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, an examination before parliament of the ruinous\r\neffects of these orders on her own manufacturers, exposing them to the\r\nnation and to the world, their Prince issued a palinodial proclamation,\r\nsuspending the orders on certain conditions, but claiming to renew them\r\nat pleasure, as a matter of right. Even this might have prevented the\r\nwar, if done and known here before its declaration. But the sword being\r\nonce drawn, the expense of arming incurred, and hostilities in full\r\ncourse, it would have been unwise to discontinue them, until effectual\r\nprovision should be agreed to by England, for protecting our citizens on\r\nthe high seas from impressment by her naval commanders, through, error,\r\nvoluntary or involuntary; the fact being notorious, that these officers,\r\nentering our ships at sea under pretext of searching for their seamen,\r\n(which they have no right to do by the law or usage of nations, which\r\nthey neither do, nor ever did, as to any other nation but ours, and\r\nwhich no nation ever before pretended to do in any case), entering\r\nour ships, I say, under pretext of searching for and taking out their\r\nseamen, they took ours, native as well as naturalized, knowing them to\r\nbe ours, merely because they wanted them; insomuch, that no American\r\ncould safely cross the ocean, or venture to pass by sea from one to\r\nanother of our own ports. It is not long since they impressed at sea two\r\nnephews of General Washington, returning from Europe, and put them,\r\nas common seamen, under the ordinary discipline of their ships of war.\r\nThere are certainly other wrongs to be settled between England and us;\r\nbut of a minor character, and such as a proper spirit of conciliation on\r\nboth sides would not permit to continue them at war. The sword, however,\r\ncan never again be sheathed, until the personal safety of an American\r\non the ocean, among the most important and most vital of the rights we\r\npossess, is completely provided for.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we heard of her partial repeal of her orders of council, we\r\noffered instantly to suspend hostilities by an armistice, if she would\r\nsuspend her impressments, and meet us in arrangements for securing our\r\ncitizens against them. She refused to do it, because impracticable by\r\nany arrangement, as she pretends; but, in truth, because a body of sixty\r\nto eighty thousand of the finest seamen in the world, which we possess,\r\nis too great a resource for manning her exaggerated navy, to be\r\nrelinquished, as long as she can keep it open. Peace is in her hand,\r\nwhenever she will renounce the practice of aggression on the persons of\r\nour citizens. If she thinks it worth eternal war, eternal war we\r\nmust have. She alleges that the sameness of language, of manners, of\r\nappearance, renders it impossible to distinguish us from her subjects.\r\nBut because we speak English, and look like them, are we to be punished?\r\nAre free and independent men to be submitted to their bondage?\r\n\r\nEngland has misrepresented to all Europe this ground of the war. She\r\nhas called it a new pretension, set up since the repeal of her orders\r\nof council. She knows there has never been a moment of suspension of our\r\nreclamations against it, from General Washington’s time inclusive, to\r\nthe present day: and that it is distinctly stated in our declaration of\r\nwar, as one of its principal causes. She has pretended we have entered\r\ninto the war, to establish the principle of ‘free bottoms, free goods,’\r\nor to protect her seamen against her own right over them. We contend for\r\nneither of these. She pretends we are partial to France; that we have\r\nobserved a fraudulent and unfaithful neutrality between her and her\r\nenemy. She knows this to be false, and that if there has been any\r\ninequality in our proceedings towards the belligerents, it has been in\r\nher favor. Her ministers are in possession of full proofs of this.\r\nOur accepting at once, and sincerely, the mediation of the virtuous\r\nAlexander, their greatest friend, and the most aggravated enemy of\r\nBonaparte, sufficiently proves whether we have partialities on the side\r\nof her enemy. I sincerely pray that this mediation may produce a just\r\npeace. It will prove that the immortal character, which has first\r\nstopped by war the career of the destroyer of mankind, is the friend of\r\npeace, of justice, of human happiness, and the patron of unoffending\r\nand injured nations. He is too honest and impartial to countenance\r\npropositions of peace derogatory to the freedom of the seas.\r\n\r\nShall I apologize to you, my dear Madam, for this long political letter?\r\nBut yours justifies the subject, and my feelings must plead for the\r\nunreserved expression of them; and they have been the less reserved,\r\nas being from a private citizen, retired from all connection with\r\nthe government of his country, and whose ideas, expressed without\r\ncommunication with any one, are neither known, nor imputable to them.\r\n\r\nThe dangers of the sea are now so great, and the possibilities of\r\ninterception by sea and land such, that I shall subscribe no name to\r\nthis letter. You will know from whom it comes, by its reference to the\r\ndate of time and place of yours, as well as by its subject in answer to\r\nthat. This omission must not lessen in your view the assurances of my\r\ngreat esteem, of my sincere sympathies for the share which you bear in\r\nthe afflictions of your country, and the deprivations to which a lawless\r\nwill has subjected you. In return, you enjoy the dignified satisfaction\r\nof having met them, rather than be yoked, with the abject, to his car;\r\nand that, in withdrawing from oppression, you have followed the virtuous\r\nexample of a father, whose name will ever be dear to your country and\r\nto mankind. With my prayers that you may be restored to it, that you may\r\nsee it re-established in that temperate portion of liberty which does\r\nnot infer either anarchy or licentiousness, in that high degree of\r\nprosperity which would be the consequence of such a government, in\r\nthat, in short, which the constitution of 1789 would have insured it, if\r\nwisdom could have stayed at that point the fervid but imprudent zeal of\r\nmen, who did not know the character of their own countrymen, and that\r\nyou may long live in health and happiness under it, and leave to the\r\nworld a well educated and virtuous representative and descendant of\r\nyour honored father, is the ardent prayer of the sincere and respectful\r\nfriend who writes this letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CVIII.--TO JOHN ADAMS, May 27, 1813\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nMonticello, May 27, 1813.\r\n\r\nAnother of our friends of seventy-six is gone, my Dear Sir, another of\r\nthe co-signers of the Independence of our country. And a better man than\r\nRush could not have left us, more benevolent, more learned, of finer\r\ngenius, or more honest. We too must go; and that ere long. I believe\r\nwe are under half a dozen at present; I mean the signers of the\r\nDeclaration. Yourself, Gerry, Carroll, and myself, are all I know to be\r\nliving. I am the only one south of the Potomac. Is Robert Treat Paine,\r\nor Floyd living? It is long since I heard of them, and yet I do not\r\nrecollect to have heard of their deaths.\r\n\r\nMoreton’s deduction of the origin of our Indians from the fugitive\r\nTrojans, stated in your letter of January the 26th, and his manner\r\nof accounting for the sprinkling of their Latin with Greeks is really\r\namusing. Adair makes them talk Hebrew. Reinold Foster derives them from\r\nthe soldiers sent by Kouli Khan to conquer Japan. Brerewood, from the\r\nTartars, as well as our bears, wolves, foxes, &c. which, he says, ‘must\r\nof necessity fetch their beginning from Noah’s ark, which rested after\r\nthe deluge, in Asia, seeing they could not proceed by the course\r\nof nature, as the imperfect sort of living creatures do, from\r\nputrefaction.’ Bernard Romans is of opinion that God created an original\r\nman and woman in this part of the globe. Doctor Barton thinks they are\r\nnot specifically different from the Persians; but, taking afterwards a\r\nbroader range, he thinks, ‘that in all the vast countries of America,\r\nthere is but one language, nay, that it may be proven, or rendered\r\nhighly probable, that all the languages of the earth bear some affinity\r\ntogether.’ This reduces it to a question of definition, in which every\r\none is free to use his own: to wit, What constitutes identity, or\r\ndifference in two things, in the common acceptation of sameness? All\r\nlanguages may be called the same, as being all made up of the same\r\nprimitive sounds, expressed by the letters of the different alphabets.\r\nBut, in this sense, all things on earth are the same, as consisting of\r\nmatter. This gives up the useful distribution into genera and species,\r\nwhich we form, arbitrarily indeed, for the relief of our imperfect\r\nmemories. To aid the question, from whence our Indian tribes descended,\r\nsome have gone into their religion, their morals, their manners,\r\ncustoms, habits, and physical forms. By such helps it may be learnedly\r\nproved, that our trees and plants of every kind are descended from\r\nthose of Europe; because, like them, they have no locomotion, they\r\ndraw nourishment from the earth, they clothe themselves with leaves\r\nin spring, of which they divest themselves in autumn for the sleep of\r\nwinter, he. Our animals too must be descended from those of Europe,\r\nbecause our wolves eat lambs, our deer are gregarious, our ants hoard,\r\n&c. But when, for convenience, we distribute languages, according to\r\ncommon understanding, into classes originally different, as we choose\r\nto consider them, as the Hebrew, the Greek, the Celtic, the Gothic; and\r\nthese again into genera, or families, as the Icelandic, German, Swedish,\r\nDanish, English; and these last into species, or dialects, as English,\r\nScotch, Irish, we then ascribe other meanings to the terms, ‘same’ and\r\n‘different.’ In some one of these senses, Barton, and Adair, and Foster,\r\nand Brerewood, and Moreton, may be right, every one according to his\r\nown definition of what constitutes ‘identity.’ Romans, indeed, takes a\r\nhigher stand, and supposes a separate creation. On the same unscriptural\r\nground, he had but to mount one step higher, to suppose no creation at\r\nall, but that all things have existed without beginning in time, as\r\nthey now exist, and may for ever exist, producing and reproducing in a\r\ncircle, without end. This would very summarily dispose of Mr. Moreton’s\r\nlearning, and show that the question of Indian origin, like many others,\r\npushed to a certain height, must receive the same answer, ‘Ignoro.’ You\r\nask if the usage of hunting in circles has ever been known among any of\r\nour tribes of Indians? It has been practised by them all; and is to this\r\nday, by those still remote from the settlements of the whites. But their\r\nnumbers not enabling them, like Genghis Khan’s seven hundred thousand,\r\nto form themselves into circles of one hundred miles diameter, they make\r\ntheir circle by firing the leaves fallen on the ground, which gradually\r\nforcing the animals to a centre, they there slaughter them with arrows,\r\ndarts, and other missiles. This is called fire-hunting, and has been\r\npractised in this State within my time, by the white inhabitants. This\r\nis the most probable cause of the origin and extension of the vast\r\nprairies in the western country, where the grass having been of\r\nextraordinary luxuriance, has made a conflagration sufficient to kill\r\neven the old as well as the young timber.\r\n\r\nI sincerely congratulate you on the successes of our little navy; which\r\nmust be more gratifying to you than to most men, as having been the\r\nearly and constant advocate of wooden walls. If I have differed with\r\nyou on this ground, it was not on the principle, but the time; supposing\r\nthat we cannot build or maintain a navy, which will not immediately fall\r\ninto the same gulph which has swallowed not only the minor navies, but\r\neven those of the great second-rate powers of the sea. Whenever these\r\ncan be resuscitated, and brought so near to a balance with England that\r\nwe can turn the scale, then is my epoch for aiming at a navy. In\r\nthe mean time, one competent to keep the Barbary States in order is\r\nnecessary; these being the only smaller powers disposed to quarrel\r\nwith us. But I respect too much the weighty opinions of others to be\r\nunyielding on this point, and acquiesce with the prayer, ‘_quod\r\nfelix faustumque sit_’; adding ever a sincere one for your health and\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CIX.--TO JOHN ADAMS, June 15, 1813\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nMonticello, June 15, 1813.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI wrote you a letter on the 27th of May, which probably would reach you\r\nabout the 3rd instant, and on the 9th I received yours of the 29th of\r\nMay. Of Lindsay’s Memoirs I had never before heard, and scarcely indeed\r\nof himself. It could not, therefore, but be unexpected, that two letters\r\nof mine should have any thing to do with his life. The name of his\r\neditor was new to me, and certainly presents itself for the first time\r\nunder unfavorable circumstances. Religion, I suppose, is the scope of\r\nhis book; and that a writer on that subject should usher himself to the\r\nworld in the very act of the grossest abuse of confidence, by publishing\r\nprivate letters which passed between two friends, with no views to their\r\never being made public, is an instance of inconsistency as well as of\r\ninfidelity, of which I would rather be the victim than the author.\r\n\r\nBy your kind quotation of the dates of my two letters, I have been\r\nenabled to turn to them. They had completely vanished from my memory.\r\nThe last is on the subject of religion, and by its publication will\r\ngratify the priesthood with new occasion of repeating their comminations\r\nagainst me. They wish it to be believed, that he can have no religion\r\nwho advocates its freedom. This was not the doctrine of Priestley; and I\r\nhonored him for the example of liberality he set to his order. The\r\nfirst letter is political. It recalls to our recollection the gloomy\r\ntransactions of the times, the doctrines they witnessed, and the\r\nsensibilities they excited. It was a confidential communication of\r\nreflections on these from one friend to another, deposited in his bosom,\r\nand never meant to trouble the public mind. Whether the character of\r\nthe times is justly portrayed or not, posterity will decide. But on one\r\nfeature of them, they can never decide, the sensations excited in free\r\nyet firm minds by the terrorism of the day. None can conceive who did\r\nnot witness them, and they were felt by one party only. This letter\r\nexhibits their side of the medal. The federalists, no doubt, have\r\npresented the other, in their private correspondences, as well as open\r\naction. If these correspondences should ever be laid open to the public\r\neye, they will probably be found not models of comity towards their\r\nadversaries. The readers of my letter should be cautioned not to confine\r\nits view to this country alone. England and its alarmists were equally\r\nunder consideration. Still less must they consider it as looking\r\npersonally towards you. You happen, indeed, to be quoted, because you\r\nhappened to express more pithily than had been done by themselves, one\r\nof the mottos of the party. This was in your answer to the address of\r\nthe young men of Philadelphia. [See Selection of Patriotic Addresses,\r\npage 198.] One of the questions, you know, on which our parties took\r\ndifferent sides, was on the improvability of the human mind, in science,\r\nin ethics, in government, &c. Those who advocated reformation of\r\ninstitutions, _pari passu_ with the progress of science, maintained that\r\nno definite limits could be assigned to that progress. The enemies of\r\nreform, on the other hand, denied improvement, and advocated steady\r\nadherence to the principles, practices, and institutions of our fathers,\r\nwhich they represented as the consummation of wisdom, and acme of\r\nexcellence, beyond which the human mind could never advance. Although in\r\nthe passage of your answer alluded to, you expressly disclaim the wish\r\nto influence the freedom of inquiry, you predict that that will produce\r\nnothing more worthy of transmission to posterity than the principles,\r\ninstitutions, and systems of education received from their ancestors.\r\nI do not consider this as your deliberate opinion. You possess yourself\r\ntoo much science, not to see how much is still ahead of you, unexplained\r\nand unexplored. Your own consciousness must place you as far before\r\nour ancestors, as in the rear of our posterity. I consider it as an\r\nexpression lent to the prejudices of your friends; and although I\r\nhappened to cite it from you, the whole letter shows I had them only\r\nin view. In truth, my dear Sir, we were far from considering you as\r\nthe author of all the measures we blamed. They were placed under the\r\nprotection of your name, but we were satisfied they wanted much of your\r\napprobation. We ascribed them to their real authors, the Pickerings, the\r\nWolcotts, the Tracys, the Sedgwicks, _et id genus omne_, with whom we\r\nsupposed you in a state of _duresse_. I well remember a conversation\r\nwith you in the morning of the day on which you nominated to the Senate\r\na substitute for Pickering, in which you expressed a just impatience\r\nunder ‘the legacy of Secretaries which General Washington had left you,’\r\nand whom you seemed, therefore, to consider as under public protection.\r\nMany other incidents showed how differently you would have acted with\r\nless impassioned advisers; and subsequent events have proved that your\r\nminds were not together. You would do me great injustice, therefore, by\r\ntaking to yourself what was intended for men who were then your secret,\r\nas they are now your open enemies. Should you write on the subject, as\r\nyou propose, I am sure we shall see you place yourself farther from them\r\nthan from us.\r\n\r\nAs to myself, I shall take no part in any discussions. I leave others to\r\njudge of what I have done, and to give me exactly that place which they\r\nshall think I have occupied. Marshall has written libels on one side;\r\nothers, I suppose, will be written on the other side; and the world will\r\nsift both, and separate the truth as well as they can. I should see with\r\nreluctance the passions of that day rekindled in this, while so many of\r\nthe actors are living, and all are too near the scene not to participate\r\nin sympathies with them. About facts you and I cannot differ; because\r\ntruth is our mutual guide. And if any opinions you may express should\r\nbe different from mine, I shall receive them with the liberality and\r\nindulgence which I ask for my own, and still cherish with warmth the\r\nsentiments of affectionate respect of which I can with so much truth\r\ntender you the assurance.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CX.--TO JOHN W. EPPES, June 24, 1813\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN W. EPPES.\r\n\r\nMonticello, June 24, 1813.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nThis letter will be on politics only. For although I do not often permit\r\nmyself to think on that subject, it sometimes obtrudes itself, and\r\nsuggests ideas which I am tempted to pursue. Some of these, relating to\r\nthe business of finance, I will hazard to you, as being at the head of\r\nthat committee, but intended for yourself individually, or such as you\r\ntrust, but certainly not for a mixed committee.\r\n\r\nIt is a wise rule, and should be fundamental in a government disposed\r\nto cherish its credit, and at the same time to restrain the use of it\r\nwithin the limits of its faculties, ‘never to borrow a dollar without\r\nlaying a tax in the same instant for paying the interest annually, and\r\nthe principal within a given term; and to consider that tax as pledged\r\nto the creditors on the public faith.’ On such a pledge as this,\r\nsacredly observed, a government may always command, on a reasonable\r\ninterest, all the lendable money of their citizens, while the\r\nnecessity of an equivalent tax is a salutary warning to them and\r\ntheir constituents against oppressions, bankruptcy, and its inevitable\r\nconsequence, revolution. But the term of redemption must be moderate,\r\nand, at any rate, within the limits of their rightful powers. But what\r\nlimits, it will be asked, does this prescribe to their powers? What is\r\nto hinder them from creating a perpetual debt? The laws of nature, I\r\nanswer. The earth belongs to the living, not to the dead. The will and\r\nthe power of man expire with his life, by nature’s law. Some societies\r\ngive it an artificial continuance, for the encouragement of industry;\r\nsome refuse it, as our aboriginal neighbors, whom we call barbarians.\r\nThe generations of men may be considered as bodies or corporations.\r\nEach generation has the usufruct of the earth during the period of its\r\ncontinuance. When it ceases to exist, the usufruct passes on to the\r\nsucceeding generation, free and unincumbered, and so on, successively,\r\nfrom one generation to another for ever. We may consider each generation\r\nas a distinct nation, with a right, by the will of its majority, to bind\r\nthemselves, but none to bind the succeeding generation, more than\r\nthe inhabitants of another country. Or the case may be likened to the\r\nordinary one of a tenant for life, who may hypothecate the land for his\r\ndebts, during the continuance of his usufruct; but at his death, the\r\nreversioner (who is also for life only) receives it exonerated from\r\nall burthen. The period of a generation, or the term of its life, is\r\ndetermined by the laws of mortality, which, varying a little only in\r\ndifferent climates, offer a general average, to be found by observation.\r\nI turn, for instance, to Buffon’s tables, of twenty-three thousand nine\r\nhundred and ninety-four deaths, and the ages at which they happened, and\r\nI find that of the numbers of all ages living at one moment, half will\r\nbe dead in twenty-four years and eight months. Bat (leaving out minors,\r\nwho have not the power of self-government) of the adults (of twenty-one\r\nyears of age) living at one moment, a majority of whom act for the\r\nsociety, one half will be dead in eighteen years and eight months. At\r\nnineteen years then from the date of a contract, the majority of the\r\ncontractors are dead, and their contract with them. Let this general\r\ntheory be applied to a particular case. Suppose the annual births of\r\nthe State of New York to be twenty-three thousand nine hundred and\r\nninety-four: the whole number of its inhabitants, according to Buffon,\r\nwill be six hundred and seventeen thousand seven hundred and three, of\r\nall ages. Of these there would constantly be two hundred and sixty-nine\r\nthousand two hundred and eighty-six minors, and three hundred and\r\nforty-eight thousand four hundred and seventeen adults, of which last,\r\none hundred and seventy-four thousand two hundred and nine will be a\r\nmajority. Suppose that majority, on the first day of the year 1794, had\r\nborrowed a sum of money equal to the fee simple value of the State, and\r\nto have consumed it in eating, drinking, and making merry in their day;\r\nor, if you please, in quarrelling and fighting with their unoffending\r\nneighbors. Within eighteen years and eight months, one half of the adult\r\ncitizens were dead. Till then, being the majority, they might rightfully\r\nlevy the interest of their debt annually on themselves and their\r\nfellow-revellers, or fellow-champions. But at that period, say at this\r\nmoment, a new majority have come into place, in their own right, and\r\nnot under the rights, the conditions, or laws of their predecessors. Are\r\nthey bound to acknowledge the debt, to consider the preceding generation\r\nas having had a right to eat up the whole soil of their country in\r\nthe course of a life, to alienate it from them (for it would be an\r\nalienation to the creditors), and would they think themselves either\r\nlegally or morally bound to give up their country, and emigrate to\r\nanother for subsistence? Every one will say no: that the soil is the\r\ngift of God to the living, as much as it had been to the deceased\r\ngeneration; and that the laws of nature impose no obligation on them to\r\npay this debt. And although, like some other natural rights, this has\r\nnot yet entered into any declaration of rights, it is no less a law, and\r\nought to be acted on by honest governments. It is, at the same time,\r\na salutary curb on the spirit of war and indebtment, which, since the\r\nmodern theory of the perpetuation of debt, has drenched the earth with\r\nblood, and crushed its inhabitants under burthens ever accumulating.\r\nHad this principle been declared in the British bill of rights, England\r\nwould have been placed under the happy disability of waging eternal war,\r\nand of contracting her thousand millions of public debt. In seeking,\r\nthen, for an ultimate term for the redemption of our debts, let us rally\r\nto this principle, and provide for their payment within the term of\r\nnineteen years, at the farthest. Our government has not, as yet, begun\r\nto act on the rule, of loans and taxation going hand in hand. Had any\r\nloan taken place in my time, I should have strongly urged a redeeming\r\ntax. For the loan which has been made since the last session of\r\nCongress, we should now set the example of appropriating some particular\r\ntax, sufficient to pay the interest annually, and the principal within\r\na fixed term, less than nineteen years. And I hope yourself and your\r\ncommittee will render the immortal service of introducing this practice.\r\nNot that it is expected that Congress should formally declare such a\r\nprinciple. They wisely enough avoid deciding on abstract questions. But\r\nthey may be induced to keep themselves within its limits.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to see our loans begin at so exorbitant an interest. And yet,\r\neven at that, you will soon be at the bottom of the loan-bag. We are an\r\nagricultural nation. Such an one employs its sparings in the purchase or\r\nimprovement of land or stocks. The lendable money among them is chiefly\r\nthat of orphans and wards in the hands of executors and guardians, and\r\nthat which the farmer lays by till he has enough for the purchase in\r\nview. In such a nation there is one and one only resource for loans,\r\nsufficient to carry them through the expense of a war; and that will\r\nalways be sufficient, and in the power of an honest government, punctual\r\nin the preservation of its faith. The fund I mean, is the mass of\r\ncirculating coin. Every one knows, that, although not literally, it is\r\nnearly true, that every paper dollar emitted banishes a silver one from\r\nthe circulation. A nation, therefore, making its purchases and payments\r\nwith bills fitted for circulation, thrusts an equal sum of coin out\r\nof circulation. This is equivalent to borrowing that sum, and yet the\r\nvendor, receiving payment in a medium as effectual as coin for his\r\npurchases or payments, has no claim to interest. And so the nation may\r\ncontinue to issue its bills as far as its wants require, and the limits\r\nof the circulation will admit. Those limits are understood to extend\r\nwith us, at present, to two hundred millions of dollars, a greater sum\r\nthan would be necessary for any war. But this, the only resource\r\nwhich the government could command with certainty, the States have\r\nunfortunately fooled away, nay corruptly alienated to swindlers and\r\nshavers, under the cover of private banks. Say, too, as an additional\r\nevil, that the disposable funds of individuals, to this great amount,\r\nhave thus been withdrawn from improvement and useful enterprise, and\r\nemployed in the useless, usurious, and demoralizing practices of bank\r\ndirectors and their accomplices. In the war of 1755, our State availed\r\nitself of this fund by issuing a paper money, bottomed on a specific tax\r\nfor its redemption, and, to insure its credit, bearing an interest of\r\nfive per cent. Within a very short time, not a bill of this emission was\r\nto be found in circulation. It was locked up in the chests of executors,\r\nguardians, widows, farmers, &tc. We then issued bills, bottomed on a\r\nredeeming tax, but bearing no interest. These were readily received, and\r\nnever depreciated a single farthing. In the revolutionary war, the old\r\nCongress and the States issued bills without interest, and without\r\ntax. They occupied the channels of circulation very freely, till\r\nthose channels were overflowed by an excess beyond all the calls of\r\ncirculation. But although we have so improvidently suffered the field of\r\ncirculating medium to be filched from us by private individuals, yet I\r\nthink we may recover it in part, and even in the whole, if the States\r\nwill co-operate with us. If treasury bills are emitted on a tax\r\nappropriated for their redemption in fifteen years, and (to insure\r\npreference in the first moments of competition) bearing an interest of\r\nsix per cent., there is no one who would not take them in preference\r\nto the bank-paper now afloat, on a principle of patriotism as well as\r\ninterest: and they would be withdrawn from circulation into private\r\nhoards to a considerable amount. Their credit once established, others\r\nmight be emitted, bottomed also on a tax, but not bearing interest: and\r\nif ever their credit faltered, open public loans, on which these bills\r\nalone should be received as specie. These, operating as a sinking fund,\r\nwould reduce the quantity in circulation, so as to maintain that in an\r\nequilibrium with specie. It is not easy to estimate the obstacles which,\r\nin the beginning, we should encounter in ousting the banks from their\r\npossession of the circulation: but a steady and judicious alternation of\r\nemissions and loans, would reduce them in time. But while this is going\r\non, another measure should be pressed, to recover ultimately our right\r\nto the circulation. The States should be applied to, to transfer\r\nthe right of issuing circulating paper to Congress exclusively, _in\r\nperpetuum_, if possible, but during the war at least, with a saving of\r\ncharter rights. I believe that every State west and south of Connecticut\r\nriver, except Delaware, would immediately do it; and the others would\r\nfollow in time.\r\n\r\nCongress would, of course, begin by obliging unchartered banks to wind\r\nup their affairs within a short time, and the others as their charters\r\nexpired, forbidding the subsequent circulation of their paper. This they\r\nwould supply with their own, bottomed, every emission, on an adequate\r\ntax, and bearing or not bearing interest, as the state of the public\r\npulse should indicate. Even in the non-complying States, these bills\r\nwould make their way, and supplant the unfunded paper of their banks,\r\nby their solidity, by the universality of their currency, and by their\r\nreceivability for customs and taxes. It would be in their power, too, to\r\ncurtail those banks to the amount of their actual specie, by gathering\r\nup their paper, and running it constantly on them. The national paper\r\nmight thus take place even in the non-complying States. In this way, I\r\nam not without a hope, that this great, this sole resource for loans\r\nin an agricultural country, might yet be recovered for the use of the\r\nnation during war: and, if obtained in perpetuum, it would always be\r\nsufficient to carry us through any war; provided, that, in the interval\r\nbetween war and war, all the outstanding paper should be called in,\r\ncoin be permitted to flow in again, and to hold the field of circulation\r\nuntil another war should require its yielding place again to the\r\nnational medium.\r\n\r\nBut it will be asked, are we to have no banks? Are merchants and\r\nothers to be deprived of the resource of short accommodations, found\r\nso convenient? I answer, let us have banks: but let them be such as are\r\nalone to be found in any country on earth, except Great Britain. There\r\nis not a bank of discount on the continent of Europe (at least there was\r\nnot one when I was there), which offers any thing but cash in exchange\r\nfor discounted bills. No one has a natural right to the trade of a\r\nmoney-lender, but he who has the money to lend. Let those then among us,\r\nwho have a monied capital, and who prefer employing it in loans rather\r\nthan otherwise, set up banks, and give cash or national bills for the\r\nnotes they discount. Perhaps, to encourage them, a larger interest than\r\nis legal in the other cases might be allowed them, on the condition of\r\ntheir lending for short periods only. It is from Great Britain we copy\r\nthe idea of giving paper in exchange for discounted bills: and while we\r\nhave derived from that country some good principles of government and\r\nlegislation, we unfortunately run into the most servile imitation of all\r\nher practices, ruinous as they prove to her, and with the gulph yawning\r\nbefore us into which those very practices are precipitating her. The\r\nunlimited emission of bank-paper has banished all her specie, and is\r\nnow, by a depreciation acknowledged by her own statesmen, carrying her\r\nrapidly to bankruptcy, as it did France, as it did us, and will do us\r\nagain, and every country permitting paper to be circulated, other than\r\nthat by public authority, rigorously limited to the just measure for\r\ncirculation. Private fortunes, in the present state of our circulation,\r\nare at the mercy of those self-created money-lenders, and are prostrated\r\nby the floods of nominal money with which their avarice deluges us.\r\nHe who lent his money to the public or to an individual, before the\r\ninstitution of the United States bank, twenty years ago, when wheat was\r\nwell sold at a dollar the bushel, and receives now his nominal sum when\r\nit sells at two dollars, is cheated of half his fortune: and by whom? By\r\nthe banks, which, since that, have thrown into circulation ten dollars\r\nof their nominal money where there was one at that time.\r\n\r\nReflect, if you please, on these ideas, and use them or not as they\r\nappear to merit. They comfort me in the belief, that they point out a\r\nresource ample enough, without overwhelming war-taxes, for the expense\r\nof the war, and possibly still recoverable; and that they hold up to\r\nall future time a resource within ourselves, ever at the command of\r\ngovernment, and competent to any wars into which we may be forced. Nor\r\nis it a slight object to equalize taxes through peace and war.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nEver affectionately yours.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXI.--TO JOHN ADAMS, June 21, 1813\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nMonticello, June 21, 1813.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: page201]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd I too, my dear Sir, like the wood-cutter of Ida, should doubt where\r\nto begin, were I to enter the forest of opinions, discussions,\r\nand contentions which have occurred in our day. I should say with\r\nTheocritus,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: page201a]\r\n\r\nBut I shall not do it. The _summum bonum_ with me is now truly\r\nepicurean, ease of body and tranquillity of mind; and to these I wish\r\nto consign my remaining days. Men have differed in opinion, and been\r\ndivided into parties by these opinions, from the first origin of\r\nsocieties; and in all governments, where they have been permitted freely\r\nto think and to speak. The same political parties which now agitate the\r\nUnited States, have existed through all time. Whether the power of the\r\npeople, or that of the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: page202]\r\n\r\nshould prevail, were questions which kept the States of Greece and Rome\r\nin eternal convulsions; as they now schismatize every people whose minds\r\nand mouths are not shut up by the gag of a despot. And in fact, the\r\nterms of whig and tory belong to natural, as well as to civil\r\nhistory. They denote the temper and constitution of mind of different\r\nindividuals. To come to our own country, and to the times when you and\r\nI became first acquainted: we well remember the violent parties which\r\nagitated the old Congress, and their bitter contests. There you and\r\nI were together, and the Jays, and the Dickinsons, and other\r\nanti-independents were arrayed against us. They cherished the monarchy\r\nof England, and we the rights of our countrymen. When our present\r\ngovernment was in the mew, passing from Confederation to Union, how\r\nbitter was the schism between the Feds and Antis. Here you and I were\r\ntogether again. For although, for a moment, separated by the Atlantic\r\nfrom the scene of action, I favored the opinion that nine States should\r\nconfirm the constitution, in order to secure it, and the others hold\r\noff, until certain amendments, deemed favorable to freedom, should\r\nbe made. I rallied in the first instant to the wiser proposition of\r\nMassachusetts, that all should confirm, and then all instruct their\r\ndelegates to urge those amendments. The amendments were made, and\r\nall were reconciled to the government. But as soon as it was put into\r\nmotion, the line of division was again drawn. We broke into two parties,\r\neach wishing to give the government a different direction; the one\r\nto strengthen the most popular branch, the other the more permanent\r\nbranches, and to extend their permanence. Here you and I separated for\r\nthe first time: and as we had been longer than most others on the public\r\ntheatre, and our names therefore were more familiar to our countrymen,\r\nthe party which considered you as thinking with them, placed your\r\nname at their head; the other, for the same reason, selected mine. But\r\nneither decency nor inclination permitted us to become the advocates\r\nof ourselves, or to take part personally in the violent contests which\r\nfollowed. We suffered ourselves, as you so well expressed it, to be\r\npassive subjects of public discussion. And these discussions, whether\r\nrelating to men, measures, or opinions, were conducted by the parties\r\nwith an animosity, a bitterness, and an indecency, which had never been\r\nexceeded. All the resources of reason and of wrath were exhausted\r\nby each party in support of its own, and to prostrate the adversary\r\nopinions; one was upbraided with receiving the anti-federalists, the\r\nother the old tories and refugees, into their bosom. Of this acrimony,\r\nthe public papers of the day exhibit ample testimony, in the debates\r\nof Congress, of State legislatures, of stump-orators, in addresses,\r\nanswers, and newspaper essays; and to these, without question, may be\r\nadded the private correspondences of individuals; and the less guarded\r\nin these, because not meant for the public eye, not restrained by the\r\nrespect due to that, but poured forth from the overflowings of the heart\r\ninto the bosom of a friend, as a momentary easement of our feelings.\r\nIn this way and in answers to addresses, you and I could indulge\r\nourselves. We have probably done it, sometimes with warmth, often with\r\nprejudice, but always, as we believed, adhering to truth. I have not\r\nexamined my letters of that day. I have no stomach to revive the memory\r\nof its feelings. But one of these letters, it seems, has got before the\r\npublic, by accident and infidelity, by the death of one friend to whom\r\nit was written, and of his friend to whom it had been communicated,\r\nand by the malice and treachery of a third person, of whom I had never\r\nbefore heard, merely to make mischief, and in the same Satanic spirit,\r\nin which the same enemy had intercepted and published, in 1776, your\r\nletter animadverting on Dickinson’s character. How it happened that I\r\nquoted you in my letter to Doctor Priestley, and for whom, and not for\r\nyourself, the strictures were meant, has been explained to you in my\r\nletter of the 15th, which had been committed to the post eight days\r\nbefore I received yours of the 10th, 11th, and 14th. That gave you the\r\nreference which these asked to the particular answer alluded to in the\r\none to Priestley. The renewal of these old discussions, my friend, would\r\nbe equally useless and irksome. To the volumes then written on these\r\nsubjects, human ingenuity can add nothing new, and the rather, as lapse\r\nof time has obliterated many of the facts. And shall you and I, my Dear\r\nSir, at our age, like Priam of old, gird on the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: page203]\r\n\r\nShall we, at our age, become the athletes of party, and exhibit\r\nourselves, as gladiators, in the arena of the newspapers? Nothing in the\r\nuniverse could induce me to it. My mind has been long fixed to bow to\r\nthe judgment of the world, who will judge by my acts, and will never\r\ntake counsel from me as to what that judgment shall be. If your objects\r\nand opinions have been misunderstood, if the measures and principles of\r\nothers have been wrongfully imputed to you, as I believe they have been,\r\nthat you should leave an explanation of them, would be an set of justice\r\nto yourself. I will add, that it has been hoped that you would leave such\r\nexplanations as would place every saddle on its right horse, and replace\r\non the shoulders of others the burdens they shifted to yours.\r\n\r\nBut all this, my friend, is offered merely for your consideration and\r\njudgment, without presuming to anticipate what you alone are qualified\r\nto decide for yourself. I mean to express my own purpose only, and the\r\nreflections which have led to it. To me, then, it appears, that there\r\nhave been differences of opinion and party differences, from the\r\nfirst establishment of governments to the present day, and on the same\r\nquestion which now divides our own country: that these will continue\r\nthrough all future time: that every one takes his side in favor of\r\nthe many, or of the few, according to his constitution, and the\r\ncircumstances in which he is placed: that opinions, which are equally\r\nhonest on both sides, should not affect personal esteem or social\r\nintercourse: that as we judge between the Claudii and the Gracchi, the\r\nWentworths and the Hampdens of past ages, so, of those among us whose\r\nnames may happen to be remembered for a while, the next generations\r\nwill judge, favorably or unfavorably, according to the complexion of\r\nindividual minds, and the side they shall themselves have taken: that\r\nnothing new can be added by you or me to what has been said by others,\r\nand will be said in every age in support of the conflicting opinions on\r\ngovernment: and that wisdom and duty dictate an humble resignation to\r\nthe verdict of our future peers. I doing this myself, I shall certainly\r\nnot suffer moot questions to affect the sentiments of sincere friendship\r\nand respect, consecrated to you by so long a course of time, and of\r\nwhich I now repeat sincere assurances,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXII.--TO JOHN ADAMS, August 22, 1813\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nMonticello, August 22, 1813.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nSince my letter of June the 27th, I am in your debt for many; all of\r\nwhich I have read with infinite delight. They open a wide field for\r\nreflection, and offer subjects enough to occupy the mind and the pen\r\nindefinitely. I must follow the good example you have set; and when\r\nI have not time to take up every subject, take up a single one. Your\r\napprobation of my outline to Dr. Priestley is a great gratification to\r\nme; and I very much suspect that if thinking men would have the courage\r\nto think for themselves, and to speak what they think, it would be found\r\nthey do not differ in religious opinions, as much as is supposed. I\r\nremember to have heard Dr. Priestley say, that if all England would\r\ncandidly examine themselves, and confess, they would find that\r\nUnitarianism was really the religion of all: and I observe a bill is now\r\ndepending in parliament for the relief of Anti-Trinitarians. It is too\r\nlate in the day for men of sincerity to pretend they believe in the\r\nPlatonic mysticisms that three are one, and one is three; and yet that\r\nthe one is not three, and the three are not one: to divide mankind by a\r\nsingle letter into\r\n\r\n[Illustration: page205]\r\n\r\nBut this constitutes the craft, the power, and the profit of the\r\npriests. Sweep away their gossamer fabrics of factitious religion, and\r\nthey would catch no more flies. We should all then, like the Quakers,\r\nlive without an order of priests, moralize for ourselves, follow the\r\noracle of conscience, and say nothing about what no man can understand,\r\nnor therefore believe; for I suppose belief to be the assent of the mind\r\nto an intelligible proposition.\r\n\r\nIt is with great pleasure I can inform you, that Priestley finished the\r\ncomparative view of the doctrines of the philosophers of antiquity, and\r\nof Jesus, before his death; and that it was printed soon after. And with\r\nstill greater pleasure, that I can have a copy of his work forwarded\r\nfrom Philadelphia, by a correspondent there, and presented for your\r\nacceptance, by the same mail which carries you this, or very soon after.\r\nThe branch of the work which the title announces, is executed with\r\nlearning and candor, as was every thing Priestley wrote: but perhaps a\r\nlittle hastily; for he felt himself pressed by the hand of death. The\r\nAbbe Batteux had, in fact, laid the foundation of this part in his\r\n‘Causes Premieres’; with which he has given us the originals of Ocellus\r\nand Timzeus, who first committed the doctrines of Pythagoras to writing:\r\nand Enfield, to whom the Doctor refers, had done it more copiously. But\r\nhe has omitted the important branch, which, in your letter of August the\r\n9th, you say you have never seen executed, a comparison of the morality\r\nof the Old Testament with that of the New. And yet, no two things were\r\never more unlike. I ought not to have asked him to give it. He dared\r\nnot. He would have been eaten alive by his intolerant brethren, the\r\nCannibal priests. And yet, this was really the most interesting branch\r\nof the work.\r\n\r\nVery soon after my letter to Doctor Priestley, the subject being still\r\nin my mind, I had leisure, during an abstraction from business for a day\r\nor two, while on the road, to think a little more on it, and to sketch\r\nmore fully than I had done to him, a syllabus of the matter which I\r\nthought should enter into the work. I wrote it to Doctor Rush; and there\r\nended all my labor on the subject; himself and Doctor Priestley being\r\nthe only depositories of my secret. The fate of my letter to Priestley,\r\nafter his death, was a warning to me on that of Doctor Rush; and at my\r\nrequest, his family were so kind as to quiet me by returning my original\r\nletter and syllabus. By this you will be sensible how much interest I\r\ntake in keeping myself clear of religious disputes before the public;\r\nand especially of seeing my syllabus disembowelled by the Aruspices of\r\nthe modern Paganism. Yet I enclose it to you with entire confidence,\r\nfree to be perused by yourself and Mrs. Adams, but by no one else; and\r\nto be returned to me.\r\n\r\nYou are right in supposing, in one of yours, that I had not read much of\r\nPriestley’s Predestination, his no-soul system, or his controversy with\r\nHorsley. But I have read his Corruptions of Christianity, and Early\r\nOpinions of Jesus, over and over again; and I rest on them, and\r\non Middleton’s writings, especially his letters from Rome, and to\r\nWaterland, as the basis of my own faith. These writings have never been\r\nanswered, nor can be answered by quoting historical proofs, as they have\r\ndone. For these facts, therefore, I cling to their learning, so much\r\nsuperior to my own.\r\n\r\nI now fly off in a tangent to another subject. Marshall, in the first\r\nvolume of his history, chapter 3, p. 180, ascribes the petition to the\r\nKing, of 1774, (1 Journ. Cong. 67) to the pen of Richard Henry Lee. I\r\nthink myself certain, it was not written by him, as well from what I\r\nrecollect to have heard, as from the internal evidence of style. He\r\nwas loose, vague, frothy, rhetorical. He was a poorer writer than his\r\nbrother Arthur; and Arthur’s standing may be seen in his Monitor’s\r\nLetters, to insure the sale of which, they took the precaution of\r\ntacking to them a new edition of the Farmer’s Letters; like Mezentius,\r\nwho ‘_mortua jungebat corpora vivis_.’ You were of the committee, and\r\ncan tell me who wrote this petition; and who wrote the Address to the\r\nInhabitants of the Colonies, ib. 45. Of the papers of July 1775, I\r\nrecollect well that Mr. Dickinson drew the petition to the King, ib.\r\n149; I think Robert R. Livingston drew the Address to the Inhabitants of\r\nGreat Britain, ib. 152. Am I right in this? And who drew the Address to\r\nthe People of Ireland, ib. 180? On these questions, I ask of your memory\r\nto help mine. Ever and affectionately yours,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXIII.--TO JOHN W. EPPES, November 6, 1813\r\n\r\nTO JOHN W. EPPES.\r\n\r\nMonticello, November 6, 1813.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI had not expected to have troubled you again on the subject of finance;\r\nbut since the date of my last, I have received from Mr. Law a letter\r\ncovering a memorial on that subject, which, from its tenor, I conjecture\r\nmust have been before Congress at their two last sessions. This paper\r\ncontains two propositions; the one for issuing treasury notes, bearing\r\ninterest, and to be circulated as money; the other for the establishment\r\nof a national bank. The first was considered in my former letter; and\r\nthe second shall be the subject of the present.\r\n\r\nThe scheme is for Congress to establish a national bank, suppose of\r\nthirty millions capital, of which they shall contribute ten millions in\r\nnew six per cent, stock, the States ten millions, and individuals ten\r\nmillions, one half of the two last contributions to be of similar stock,\r\nfor which the parties are to give cash to Congress: the whole, however,\r\nto be under the exclusive management of the individual subscribers, who\r\nare to name all the directors; neither Congress nor the States having\r\nany power of interference in its administration. Discounts are to be\r\nat five per cent., but the profits are expected to be seven per cent.\r\nCongress then will be paying six per cent, on twenty millions, and\r\nreceiving seven per cent, on ten millions, being its third of the\r\ninstitution: so that on the ten millions cash which they receive from\r\nthe States and individuals, they will, in fact, have to pay but five\r\nper cent, interest. This is the bait. The charter is proposed to be for\r\nforty or fifty years, and if any future augmentations should take place,\r\nthe individual proprietors are to have the privilege of being the sole\r\nsubscribers for that. Congress are further allowed to issue to the\r\namount of three millions of notes, bearing interest, which they are to\r\nreceive back in payment for lands at a premium of five or ten per\r\ncent., or as subscriptions for canals, roads, and bridges, in which\r\nundertakings they are, of course, to be engaged. This is a summary\r\nof the scheme, as I understand it: but it is very possible I may\r\nnot understand it in all its parts, these schemes being always made\r\nUnintelligible for the gulls who are to enter into them. The advantages\r\nand disadvantages shall be noted promiscuously as they occur; leaving\r\nout the speculation of canals, &c. which, being an episode only in the\r\nscheme, may be omitted, to disentangle it as much as we can.\r\n\r\n1. Congress are to receive five millions from the States (if they will\r\nenter into this partnership, which few probably will), and five millions\r\nfrom the individual subscribers, in exchange for ten millions of six per\r\ncent, stock, one per cent, of which, however, they will make on their\r\nten millions of stock remaining in bank, and so reduce it, in effect, to\r\na loan of ten millions at five per cent, interest. This is good: but\r\n\r\n2. They authorize this bank to throw into circulation ninety millions\r\nof dollars, (three times the capital), which increases our circulating\r\nmedium fifty per cent., depreciates proportionably the present value\r\nof the dollar, and raises the price of all future purchases in the same\r\nproportion.\r\n\r\n3. This loan of ten millions at five per cent., is to be once for all,\r\nonly. Neither the terms of the scheme, nor their own prudence could ever\r\npermit them to add to the circulation in the same, or any other way, for\r\nthe supplies of the succeeding years of the war. These succeeding years\r\nthen are to be left unprovided for, and the means of doing it in a great\r\nmeasure precluded.\r\n\r\n4. The individual subscribers, on paying their own five millions of cash\r\nto Congress, become the depositories of ten millions of stock belonging\r\nto Congress, five millions belonging to the States, and five millions to\r\nthemselves, say twenty millions, with which, as no one has a right ever\r\nto see their books, or to ask a question, they may choose their time\r\nfor running away, after adding to their booty the proceeds of as much of\r\ntheir own notes as they shall be able to throw into circulation.\r\n\r\n5. The subscribers may be one, two, or three, or more individuals, (many\r\nsingle individuals being able to pay in the five millions,) whereupon\r\nthis bank oligarchy or monarchy enters the field with ninety millions\r\nof dollars, to direct and control the politics of the nation; and of the\r\ninfluence of these institutions on our politics, and into what scale it\r\nwill be thrown, we have had abundant experience. Indeed, England herself\r\nmay be the real, while her friend and trustee here shall be the nominal\r\nand sole subscriber.\r\n\r\n6. This state of things is to be fastened on us, without the power of\r\nrelief, for forty or fifty years. That is to say, the eight millions\r\nof people now existing, for the sake of receiving one dollar and\r\ntwenty-five cents apiece at five per cent, interest, are to subject the\r\nfifty millions of people who are to succeed them within that term, to\r\nthe payment of forty-five millions of dollars, principal and interest,\r\nwhich will be payable in the course of the fifty years.\r\n\r\n7. But the great and national advantage is to be the relief of the\r\npresent scarcity of money, which is produced and proved by,\r\n\r\n1. The additional industry created to supply a variety of articles for\r\nthe troops, ammunition, he.\r\n\r\n2. By the cash sent to the frontiers, and the vacuum occasioned in the\r\ntrading towns by that.\r\n\r\n3. By the late loans.\r\n\r\n4. By the necessity of recurring to shavers with good paper, which the\r\nexisting banks are not able to take up; and\r\n\r\n5. By the numerous applications for bank charters, showing that an\r\nincrease of circulating medium is wanting.\r\n\r\nLet us examine these causes and proofs of the want of an increase of\r\nmedium, one by one.\r\n\r\n1. The additional industry created to supply a variety of articles for\r\ntroops, ammunition, &c. Now I had always supposed that war produced\r\na diminution of industry, by the number of hands it withdraws from\r\nindustrious pursuits, for employment in arms &c. which are totally\r\nunproductive. And if it calls for new industry in the articles of\r\nammunition and other military supplies, the hands are borrowed from\r\nother branches on which the demand is slackened by the war; so that it\r\nis but a shifting of these hands from one pursuit to another.\r\n\r\n2. The cash sent to the frontiers occasions a vacuum in the trading\r\ntowns, which requires a new supply. Let us examine what are the calls\r\nfor money to the frontiers. Not for clothing, tents, ammunition, arms,\r\nwhich are all bought in the trading towns. Not for provisions; for\r\nalthough these are bought partly in the intermediate country, bank-bills\r\nare more acceptable there than even in the trading towns. The pay of\r\nthe army calls for some cash; but not a great deal, as bank-notes are as\r\nacceptable with the military men, perhaps more so; and what cash is sent\r\nmust find its way back again, in exchange for the wants of the upper\r\nfrom the lower country. For we are not to suppose that cash stays\r\naccumulating there for ever.\r\n\r\n3. This scarcity has been occasioned by the late loans. But does the\r\ngovernment borrow money to keep it in their coffers? Is it not instantly\r\nrestored to circulation by payment for its necessary supplies? And are\r\nwe to restore a vacuum of twenty millions of dollars by an emission of\r\nninety millions?\r\n\r\n4. The want of medium is proved by the recurrence of individuals with\r\ngood paper to brokers at exorbitant interest; and\r\n\r\n5. By the numerous applications to the State governments for additional\r\nbanks; New York wanting eighteen millions, Pennsylvania ten millions,\r\n&c. But say more correctly, the speculators and spendthrifts of New York\r\nand Pennsylvania, but never consider them as being the States of New\r\nYork and Pennsylvania. These two items shall be considered together.\r\n\r\nIt is a litigated question, whether the circulation of paper, rather\r\nthan of specie, is a good or an evil. In the opinion of England and\r\nof English writers it is a good; in that of all other nations it is an\r\nevil; and excepting England and her copyist, the United States, there is\r\nnot a nation existing, I believe, which tolerates a paper circulation.\r\nThe experiment is going on, however, desperately in England, pretty\r\nboldly with us, and at the end of the chapter, we shall see which\r\nopinion experience approves: for I believe it to be one of those cases\r\nwhere mercantile clamor will bear down reason, until it is corrected by\r\nruin. In the mean time, however, let us reason on this new call for a\r\nnational bank.\r\n\r\nAfter the solemn decision of Congress against the renewal of the charter\r\nof the bank of the United States, and the grounds of that decision (the\r\nwant of constitutional power), I had imagined that question at rest, and\r\nthat no more applications would be made to them for the incorporation\r\nof banks. The opposition on that ground to its first establishment, the\r\nsmall majority by which it was overborne, and the means practised\r\nfor obtaining it, cannot be already forgotten. The law having passed,\r\nhowever, by a majority, its opponents, true to the sacred principle\r\nof submission to a majority, suffered the law to flow through its term\r\nwithout obstruction. During this, the nation had time to consider\r\nthe constitutional question, and when the renewal was proposed, they\r\ncondemned it, not by their representatives in Congress only, but by\r\nexpress instructions from different organs of their will. Here then\r\nwe might stop, and consider the memorial as answered. But, setting\r\nauthority apart, we will examine whether the legislature ought to comply\r\nwith it, even if they had the power.\r\n\r\nProceeding to reason on this subject, some principles must be premised\r\nas forming its basis. The adequate price of a thing depends on the\r\ncapital and labor necessary to produce it. (In the term capital, I mean\r\nto include science, because capital as well as labor has been employed\r\nto acquire it.) Two things requiring the same capital and labor should\r\nbe of the same price. If a gallon of wine requires for its production\r\nthe same capital and labor with a bushel of wheat, they should be\r\nexpressed by the same price, derived from the application of a common\r\nmeasure to them. The comparative prices of things being thus to be\r\nestimated, and expressed by a common measure, we may proceed to observe,\r\nthat were a country so insulated as to have no commercial intercourse\r\nwith any other, to confine the interchange of all its wants and supplies\r\nwithin itself, the amount of circulating medium, as a common measure\r\nfor adjusting these exchanges, would be quite immaterial. If their\r\ncirculation, for instance, were of a million of dollars, and the annual\r\nproduce of their industry equivalent to ten millions of bushels of\r\nwheat, the price of a bushel of wheat might be one dollar. If, then, by\r\na progressive coinage, their medium should be doubled, the price of a\r\nbushel of wheat might become progressively two dollars, and without,\r\ninconvenience. Whatever be the proportion of the circulating medium to\r\nthe value of the annual produce of industry, it may be considered as the\r\nrepresentative of that industry. In the first case, a bushel of wheat\r\nwill be represented by one dollar; in the second, by two dollars. This\r\nis well explained by Hume, and seems admitted by Adam Smith, (B. 2. c.\r\n2. 436, 441, 490.) But where a nation is in a full course of interchange\r\nof wants and supplies with all others, the proportion of its medium\r\nto its produce is no longer indifferent, (lb. 441.) To trade on equal\r\nterms, the common measure of values should be as nearly as possible on\r\na par with that of its corresponding nations, whose medium is in a\r\nsound state; that is to say, not in an accidental state of excess or\r\ndeficiency. Now, one of the great advantages of specie as a medium is,\r\nthat being of universal value, it will keep itself at a general level,\r\nflowing out from where it is too high into parts where it is lower.\r\nWhereas, if the medium be of local value only, as paper-money, if too\r\nlittle, indeed, gold and silver will flow in to supply the deficiency;\r\nbut if too much, it accumulates, banishes the gold and silver not locked\r\nup in vaults and hoards, and depreciates itself; that is to say, its\r\nproportion to the annual produce of industry being raised, more of it\r\nis required to represent any particular article of produce than in\r\nthe other countries. This is agreed by Smith (B. 2. c. 2. 437.), the\r\nprincipal advocate for a paper circulation; but advocating it on the\r\nsole condition that it be strictly regulated. He admits, nevertheless,\r\nthat ‘the commerce and industry of a country cannot be so secure when\r\nsuspended on the Daedalian wings of paper-money, as on the solid ground\r\nof gold and silver; and that in time of war the insecurity is greatly\r\nincreased, and great confusion possible where the circulation is for the\r\ngreater part in paper.’(B. 2. c. 2. 484.) But in a country where loans\r\nare uncertain, and a specie circulation the only sure resource for them,\r\nthe preference of that circulation assumes a far different degree of\r\nimportance, as is explained in my former letters.\r\n\r\nThe only advantage which Smith proposes by substituting paper in the\r\nroom of gold and silver money (B. 2. c. 2. 434.), is, ‘to replace an\r\nexpensive instrument with one much less costly, and sometimes equally\r\nconvenient’; that is to say, (page 437,) to allow the gold and silver\r\nto be sent abroad and converted into foreign goods,’ and to substitute\r\npaper as being a cheaper measure. But this makes no addition to the\r\nstock or capital of the nation. The coin sent out was worth as much,\r\nwhile in the country, as the goods imported and taking its place. It\r\nis only, then, a change of form in a part of the national capital, from\r\nthat of gold and silver to other goods. He admits, too, that while a\r\npart of the goods received in exchange for the coin exported, may be\r\nmaterials, tools, and provisions for the employment of an additional\r\nindustry, a part also may be taken back in foreign wines, silks, &c.\r\nto be consumed by idle people who produce nothing; and so far the\r\nsubstitution promotes prodigality, increases expense and consumption,\r\nwithout increasing production. So far also, then, it lessens the capital\r\nof the nation. What may be the amount which the conversion of the part\r\nexchanged for productive goods, may add to the former productive mass,\r\nit is not easy to ascertain, because, as he says, (page 441,) ‘It is\r\nimpossible to determine what is the proportion which the circulating\r\nmoney of any country bears to the whole value of the annual produce. It\r\nhas been computed by different authors, from a fifth* to a thirtieth of\r\nthat value.’\r\n\r\n     * The real cash or money necessary to carry on the\r\n     circulation and barter of a State, is nearly one third part\r\n     of all the annual rents of the proprietors of the said\r\n     State; that is, one ninth of the whole produce of the land.\r\n     Sir William Petty supposes one tenth part of the value of\r\n     the whole produce sufficient. Postlethwayt, _voce_, Cash.\r\n\r\nIn the United States it must be less than in any other part of the\r\ncommercial world; because the great mass of their inhabitants being\r\nin responsible circumstances, the great mass of their exchanges in the\r\ncountry is effected on credit, in their merchant’s ledger, who supplies\r\nall their wants through the year, and at the end of it receives the\r\nproduce of their farms, or other articles of their industry. It is a\r\nfact, that a farmer, with a revenue of ten thousand dollars a year, may\r\nobtain all his supplies from his merchant, and liquidate them at the end\r\nof the year, by the sale of his produce to him, without the intervention\r\nof a single dollar of cash. This, then, is merely barter, and in this\r\nway of barter a great portion of the annual produce of the United States\r\nis exchanged without the intermediation of cash. We might safely,\r\nthen, state our medium at the minimum of one thirtieth. But what is\r\none thirtieth of the value of the annual produce of the industry of the\r\nUnited States? Or what is the whole value of the annual produce of the\r\nUnited States? An able writer and competent judge of the subject, in\r\n1799, on as good grounds as probably could be taken, estimated it, on\r\nthe then population of four and a half millions of inhabitants, to\r\nbe thirty-seven and a half millions sterling, or one hundred and\r\nsixty-eight and three fourths millions of dollars. See Cooper’s\r\nPolitical Arithmetic, page 47. According to the same estimate, for our\r\npresent population it will be three hundred millions of dollars, one\r\nthirtieth of which, Smith’s minimum, would be ten millions, and\r\none fifth, his maximum, would be sixty millions for the quantum of\r\ncirculation. But suppose, that, instead of our needing the least\r\ncirculating medium of any nation, from the circumstance before\r\nmentioned, we should place ourselves in the middle term of the\r\ncalculation, to wit, at thirty-five millions. One fifth of this, at\r\nthe least, Smith thinks should be retained in specie, which would leave\r\ntwenty-eight millions of specie to be exported in exchange for other\r\ncommodities; and if fifteen millions of that should be returned in\r\nproductive goods, and not in articles of prodigality, that would be the\r\namount of capital which this operation would add to the existing mass.\r\nBut to what mass? Not that of the three hundred millions, which is only\r\nits gross annual produce; but to that capital of which the three hundred\r\nmillions are but the annual produce. But this being gross, we may infer\r\nfrom it the value of the capital by considering that the rent of lands\r\nis generally fixed at one third of the gross produce, and is deemed its\r\nnett profit, and twenty times that its fee simple value. The profits on\r\nlanded capital may, with accuracy enough for our purpose, be supposed\r\non a par with those of other capital. This would give us then for\r\nthe United States, a capital of two thousand millions, all in active\r\nemployment, and exclusive of unimproved lands lying in a great degree\r\ndormant. Of this, fifteen millions would be the hundred and thirty-third\r\npart. And it is for this petty addition to the capital of the nation,\r\nthis minimum of one dollar, added to one hundred and thirty-three and a\r\nthird, or three fourths per cent., that we are to give up our gold and\r\nsilver medium, its intrinsic solidity, its universal value, and its\r\nsaving powers in time of war, and to substitute for it paper, with all\r\nits train of evils, moral, political, and physical, which I will not\r\npretend to enumerate.\r\n\r\nThere is another authority to which we may appeal for the proper\r\nquantity of circulating medium for the United States. The old Congress,\r\nwhen we were estimated at about two millions of people, on a long and\r\nable discussion, June the 22nd, 1775, decided the sufficient quantity to\r\nbe two millions of dollars, which sum they then emitted.* According to\r\nthis, it should be eight millions, now that we are eight millions of\r\npeople. This differs little from Smith’s minimum of ten millions, and\r\nstrengthens our respect for that estimate.\r\n\r\n     * Within five months after this they were compelled, by the\r\n     necessities of the war, to abandon the idea of emitting only\r\n     an adequate circulation, and to make those necessities the\r\n     sole measure of their emissions.\r\n\r\nThere is, indeed, a convenience in paper; its easy transmission from one\r\nplace to another. But this may be mainly supplied by bills of exchange,\r\nso as to prevent any great displacement of actual coin. Two places\r\ntrading together balance their dealings, for the most part, by their\r\nmutual supplies, and the debtor individuals of either may, instead of\r\ncash, remit the bills of those who are creditors in the same dealings;\r\nor may obtain them through some third place with which both have\r\ndealings. The cases would be rare where such bills could not be\r\nobtained, either directly or circuitously, and too unimportant to the\r\nnation to overweigh the train of evils flowing from paper circulation.\r\n\r\nFrom eight to thirty-five millions then being our proper circulation,\r\nand two hundred millions the actual one, the memorial proposes to issue\r\nninety millions more, because, it says, a great scarcity of money is\r\nproved by the numerous applications for banks; to wit, New York for\r\neighteen millions, Pennsylvania ten millions, &c. The answer to this\r\nshall be quoted, from Adam Smith (B. 2, c. 2, page 462), where speaking\r\nof the complaints of the traders against the Scotch bankers, who had\r\nalready gone too far in their issues of paper, he says, ‘Those traders\r\nand other undertakers having got so much assistance from banks, wished\r\nto get still more. The banks, they seem to have thought, could extend\r\ntheir credits to whatever sum might be wanted, without incurring any\r\nother expense besides that of a few reams of paper. They complained\r\nof the contracted views and dastardly spirit of the directors of those\r\nbanks, which did not, they said, extend their credits in proportion to\r\nthe extension of the trade of the country; meaning, no doubt, by the\r\nextension of that trade, the extension of their own projects beyond what\r\nthey could carry on, either with their own capital, or with what they\r\nhad credit to borrow of private people in the usual way of bond or\r\nmortgage. The banks, they seem to have thought, were in honor bound to\r\nsupply the deficiency, and to provide them with all the capital\r\nwhich they wanted to trade with.’ And again (page 470): ‘When bankers\r\ndiscovered that certain projectors were trading, not with any capital\r\nof their own, but with that which they advanced them, they endeavored\r\nto withdraw gradually, making every day greater and greater difficulties\r\nabout discounting. These difficulties alarmed and enraged in the highest\r\ndegree those projectors. Their own distress, of which this prudent and\r\nnecessary reserve of the banks was no doubt the immediate occasion, they\r\ncalled the distress of the country; and this distress of the country,\r\nthey said, was altogether owing to the ignorance, pusillanimity, and bad\r\nconduct of the banks, which did not give a sufficiently liberal aid to\r\nthe spirited undertakings of those who exerted themselves in order to\r\nbeautify, improve, and enrich the country. It was the duty of the banks,\r\nthey seemed to think, to lend for as long a time, and to as great an\r\nextent, as they might wish to borrow.’ It is, probably, the good paper\r\nof these projectors, which, the memorial says, the banks being unable to\r\ndiscount, goes into the hands of brokers, who (knowing the risk of this\r\ngood paper) discount it at a much higher rate than legal interest, to\r\nthe great distress of the enterprising adventurers, who had rather try\r\ntrade on borrowed capital, than go to the plough or other laborious\r\ncalling. Smith again says, (page 478,) ‘That the industry of Scotland\r\nlanguished for want of money to employ it, was the opinion of the famous\r\nMr. Law. By establishing a bank of a particular kind, which he seems to\r\nhave imagined might issue paper to the amount of the whole value of all\r\nthe lands in the country, he proposed to remedy this want of money. It\r\nwas afterwards adopted, with some variations, by the Duke of Orleans, at\r\nthat time Regent of France. The idea of the possibility of multiplying\r\npaper to almost any extent, was the real foundation of what is called\r\nthe Mississippi scheme, the most extravagant project both of banking and\r\nstockjobbing, that perhaps the world ever saw. The principles upon\r\nwhich it was founded are explained by Mr. Law himself, in a discourse\r\nconcerning money and trade, which he published in Scotland when he first\r\nproposed his project. The splendid but visionary ideas which are set\r\nforth in that and some other works upon the same principles, still\r\ncontinue to make an impression upon many people, and have perhaps,\r\nin part, contributed to that excess of banking which has of late been\r\ncomplained of both in Scotland and in other places.’ The Mississippi\r\nscheme, it is well known, ended in France in the bankruptcy of the\r\npublic treasury, the crush of thousands and thousands of private\r\nfortunes, and scenes of desolation and distress equal to those of an\r\ninvading army, burning and laying waste all before it.\r\n\r\nAt the time we were funding our national debt, we heard much about ‘a\r\npublic debt being a public blessing’; that the stock representing it was\r\na creation of active capital for the aliment of commerce, manufactures,\r\nand agriculture. This paradox was well adapted to the minds of believers\r\nin dreams, and the gulls of that size entered _bonâ fide_ into it. But\r\nthe art and mystery of banks is a wonderful improvement on that. It\r\nis established on the principle, that ‘private debts are a public\r\nblessing;’ that the evidences of those private debts, called bank-notes,\r\nbecome active capital, and aliment the whole commerce, manufactures,\r\nand agriculture of the United States. Here are a set of people, for\r\ninstance, who have bestowed on us the great blessing of running in our\r\ndebt about two hundred millions of dollars, without our knowing who they\r\nare, where they are, or what property they have to pay this debt when\r\ncalled on; nay, who have made us so sensible of the blessings of\r\nletting them run in our debt, that we have exempted them by law from the\r\nrepayment of these debts beyond a given proportion, (generally estimated\r\nat one third.) And to fill up the measure of blessing, instead of\r\npaying, they receive an interest on what they owe from those to whom\r\nthey owe; for all the notes, or evidences of what they owe, which we\r\nsee in circulation, have been lent to somebody on an interest which is\r\nlevied again on us through the medium of commerce. And they are so ready\r\nstill to deal out their liberalities to us, that they are now willing to\r\nlet themselves run in our debt ninety millions more, on our paying them\r\nthe same premium of six or eight per cent, interest, and on the same\r\nlegal exemption from the repayment of more than thirty millions of the\r\ndebt, when it shall be called for. But let us look at this principle\r\nin its original form, and its copy will then be equally understood.\r\n‘A public debt is a public blessing.’ That our debt was juggled from\r\nforty-three up to eighty millions, and funded at that amount, according\r\nto this opinion, was a great public blessing, because the evidences of\r\nit could be vested in commerce, and thus converted into active capital,\r\nand then the more the debt was made to be, the more active capital was\r\ncreated. That is to say, the creditors could now employ in commerce the\r\nmoney due them from the public, and make from it an annual profit of\r\nfive per cent., or four millions of dollars. But observe, that the\r\npublic were at the same time paying on it an interest of exactly the\r\nsame amount of four millions of dollars. Where then is the gain to\r\neither party, which makes it a public blessing? There is no change in\r\nthe state of things, but of persons only. A has a debt due to him from\r\nthe public, of which he holds their certificate as evidence, and on\r\nwhich he is receiving an annual interest. He wishes, however, to have\r\nthe money itself, and to go into business with it. B has an equal sum of\r\nmoney in business, but wishes now to retire, and live on the interest.\r\nHe therefore gives it to A, in exchange for A’s certificates of public\r\nstock. Now, then, A has the money to employ in business, which B so\r\nemployed before. B has the money on interest to live on, which A lived\r\non before: and the public pays the interest to B, which they paid to\r\nA before. Here is no new creation of capital, no additional money\r\nemployed, nor even a change in the employment of a single dollar.\r\nThe only change is of place between A and B, in which we discover no\r\ncreation of capital, nor public blessing. Suppose, again, the public to\r\nowe nothing. Then A not having lent his money to the public, would be\r\nin possession of it himself, and would go into business without the\r\nprevious operation of selling stock. Here again, the same quantity of\r\ncapital is employed as in the former case, though no public debt exists.\r\nIn neither case is there any creation of active capital, nor other\r\ndifference than that there is a public debt in the first case, and none\r\nin the last; and we may safely ask which of the two situations is most\r\ntruly a public blessing? If, then, a public debt be no public blessing,\r\nwe may pronounce _a fortiori_, that a private one cannot be so. If the\r\ndebt which the banking companies owe be a blessing to any body, it is to\r\nthemselves alone, who are realizing a solid interest of eight or ten\r\nper cent, on it. As to the public, these companies have banished all our\r\ngold and silver medium, which, before their institution, we had without\r\ninterest, which never could have perished in our hands, and would have\r\nbeen our salvation now in the hour of war; instead of which, they have\r\ngiven us two hundred millions of froth and bubble, on which we are to\r\npay them heavy interest, until it shall vanish into air, as Morris’s\r\nnotes did. We are warranted, then, in affirming that this parody on the\r\nprinciple of ‘a public debt being a public blessing,’ and its mutation\r\ninto the blessing of private instead of public debts, is as ridiculous\r\nas the original principle itself. In both cases, the truth is, that\r\ncapital may be produced by industry, and accumulated by economy: but\r\njugglers only will propose to create it by legerdemain tricks with\r\npaper. I have called the actual circulation of bank paper in the United\r\nStates, two hundred millions of dollars. I do not recollect where I have\r\nseen this estimate; but I retain the impression that I thought it just\r\nat the time. It may be tested, however, by a list of the banks now in\r\nthe United States, and the amount of their capital. I have no means of\r\nrecurring to such a list for the present day: but I turn to two lists in\r\nmy possession for the years of 1803 and 1804.\r\n\r\nIn 1803, there were thirty-four banks, whose capital was $28,902,000\r\n\r\nIn 1804, there were sixty-six, consequently thirty-two additional ones.\r\nTheir capital is not stated, but at the average of the others (excluding\r\nthe highest, that of the United States, which was of ten millions)\r\nthey would be of six hundred thousand dollars each, and\r\nadd.........19,200,000\r\n\r\nMaking a total of........ $48,102,000\r\n\r\nor say, of fifty millions in round numbers. Now every one knows the\r\nimmense multiplication of these institutions since 1804. If they have\r\nonly doubled, their capital will be of one hundred millions, and if\r\ntrebled, as I think probable, it will be of one hundred and fifty\r\nmillions, on which they are at liberty to circulate treble the amount.\r\nI should sooner, therefore, believe two hundred millions to be far below\r\nthan above the actual circulation. In England, by a late parliamentary\r\ndocument, (see Virginia Argus of October the 18th, 1813, and other\r\npublic papers of about that date) it appears that six years ago, the\r\nbank of England had twelve millions of pounds sterling in circulation,\r\nwhich had increased to forty-two millions in 1812, or to one hundred and\r\neighty-nine millions of dollars. What proportion all the other banks may\r\nadd to this, I do not know: if we were allowed to suppose they equal\r\nit, this would give a circulation of three hundred and seventy-eight\r\nmillions, or the double of ours on a double population. But that nation\r\nis essentially commercial, ours essentially agricultural, and needing,\r\ntherefore, less circulating medium, because the produce of the\r\nhusbandman comes but once a year, and is then partly consumed at home,\r\npartly exchanged by barter. The dollar, which was of four shillings and\r\nsix pence sterling, was, by the same document, stated to be then six\r\nshillings and nine pence, a depreciation of exactly fifty per cent. The\r\naverage price of wheat on the continent of Europe, at the commencement\r\nof its present war with England, was about a French crown, of one\r\nhundred and ten cents, the bushel. With us it was one hundred cents, and\r\nconsequently we could send it there in competition with their own.\r\nThat ordinary price has now doubled with us, and more than doubled in\r\nEngland; and although a part of this augmentation may proceed from the\r\nwar demand, yet from the extraordinary nominal rise in the prices of\r\nland and labor here, both of which have nearly doubled in that period,\r\nand are still rising with every new bank, it is evident that were\r\na general peace to take place to-morrow, and time allowed for the\r\nre-establishment of commerce, justice, and order, we could not afford\r\nto raise wheat for much less than two dollars, while the continent of\r\nEurope, having no paper circulation, and that of its specie not being\r\naugmented, would raise it at their former price of one hundred and ten\r\ncents. It follows, then, that with our redundancy of paper, we cannot,\r\nafter peace, send a bushel of wheat to Europe, unless extraordinary\r\ncircumstances double its price in particular places, and that then the\r\nexporting countries of Europe could undersell us. It is said our paper\r\nis as good as silver, because we may have silver for it at the bank\r\nwhere it issues. This is not true. One, two, or three persons might have\r\nit: but a general application would soon exhaust their vaults, and leave\r\na ruinous proportion of their paper in its intrinsic worthless form.\r\nIt is a fallacious pretence, for another reason. The inhabitants of the\r\nbanking cities might obtain cash for their paper, as far as the cash of\r\nthe vaults would hold out; but distance puts it out of the power of the\r\ncountry to do this. A farmer having a note of a Boston or Charleston\r\nbank, distant hundreds of miles, has no means of calling for the cash.\r\nAnd while these calls are impracticable for the country, the banks have\r\nno fear of their being made from the towns; because their inhabitants\r\nare mostly on their books, and there on sufferance only and during good\r\nbehavior.\r\n\r\nIn this state of things, we are called on to add ninety millions more\r\nto the circulation. Proceeding in this career, it is infallible, that we\r\nmust end where the revolutionary paper ended. Two hundred millions was\r\nthe whole amount of all the emissions of the old Congress, at which\r\npoint their bills ceased to circulate. We are now at that sum; but with\r\ntreble the population, and of course a longer tether. Our depreciation\r\nis, as yet, but at about two for one. Owing to the support its credit\r\nreceives from the small reservoirs of specie in the vaults of the banks,\r\nit is impossible to say at what point their notes will stop. Nothing\r\nis necessary to effect it but a general alarm; and that may take\r\nplace whenever the public shall begin to reflect on, and perceive, the\r\nimpossibility that the banks should repay this sum. At present, caution\r\nis inspired no farther than to keep prudent men from selling property\r\non long payments. Let us suppose the panic to arise at three hundred\r\nmillions, a point to which every session of the legislatures hastens\r\nus by long strides. Nobody dreams that they would have three hundred\r\nmillions of specie to satisfy the holders of their notes. Were they even\r\nto stop now, no one supposes they have two hundred millions in cash, or\r\neven the sixty-six and two-thirds millions, to which amount alone the\r\nlaw obliges them to repay. One hundred and thirty-three and one-third\r\nmillions of loss, then, is thrown on the public by law; and as to the\r\nsixty-six and two-thirds, which they are legally bound to pay, and ought\r\nto have in their vaults, every one knows there is no such amount of cash\r\nin the United States, and what would be the course with what they really\r\nhave there? Their notes are refused. Cash is called for. The inhabitants\r\nof the banking towns will get what is in the vaults, until a few banks\r\ndeclare their insolvency; when, the general crush becoming evident, the\r\nothers will withdraw even the cash they have, declare their bankruptcy\r\nat once, and leave an empty house and empty coffers for the holders of\r\ntheir notes. In this scramble of creditors, the country gets nothing,\r\nthe towns but little. What are they to do? Bring suits? A million of\r\ncreditors bring a million of suits against John Nokes and Robert Styles,\r\nwheresoever to be found? All nonsense. The loss is total. And a sum is\r\nthus swindled from our citizens, of seven times the amount of the real\r\ndebt, and four times that of the factitious one of the United States,\r\nat the close of the war. All this they will justly charge on their\r\nlegislatures; but this will be poor satisfaction for the two or three\r\nhundred millions they will have lost. It is time, then, for the public\r\nfunctionaries to look to this. Perhaps it may not be too late. Perhaps,\r\nby giving time to the banks, they may call in and pay off their paper\r\nby degrees. But no remedy is ever to be expected while it rests with\r\nthe State legislatures. Personal motives can be excited through so many\r\navenues to their will, that, in their hands, it will continue to go on\r\nfrom bad to worse, until the catastrophe overwhelms us. I still\r\nbelieve, however, that on proper representations of the subject, a great\r\nproportion of these legislatures would cede to Congress their power of\r\nestablishing banks, saving the charter rights already granted. And this\r\nshould be asked, not by way of amendment to the constitution, because\r\nuntil three fourths should consent, nothing could be done; but accepted\r\nfrom them one by one, singly, as their consent might be obtained. Any\r\nsingle State, even if no other should come into the measure, would find\r\nits interest in arresting foreign bank-paper immediately, and its own\r\nby degrees. Specie would flow in on them as paper disappeared. Their\r\nown banks would call in and pay off their notes gradually, and their\r\nconstituents would thus be saved from the general wreck. Should the\r\ngreater part of the States concede, as is expected, their power over\r\nbanks to Congress, besides insuring their own safety, the paper of\r\nthe non-conceding States might be so checked and circumscribed, by\r\nprohibiting its receipt in any of the conceding States, and even in the\r\nnon-conceding as to duties, taxes, judgments, or other demands of the\r\nUnited States, or of the citizens of other States, that it would\r\nsoon die of itself, and the medium of gold and silver be universally\r\nrestored. This is what ought to be done. But it will not be done.\r\n_Carthago non delebitur_. The overbearing clamor of merchants,\r\nspeculators, and projectors, will drive us before them with our eyes\r\nopen, until, as in France, under the Mississippi bubble, our citizens\r\nwill be overtaken by the crash of this baseless fabric, without\r\nother satisfaction than that of execrations on the heads of those\r\nfunctionaries, who, from ignorance, pusillanimity, or corruption, have\r\nbetrayed the fruits of their industry into the hands of projectors and\r\nswindlers.\r\n\r\nWhen I speak comparatively of the paper emissions of the old Congress\r\nand the present banks, let it not be imagined that I cover them under\r\nthe same mantle. The object of the former was a holy one; for if ever\r\nthere was a holy war, it was that which saved our liberties and gave us\r\nindependence. The object of the latter, is to enrich swindlers at the\r\nexpense of the honest and industrious part of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe sum of what has been said is, that pretermitting the constitutional\r\nquestion on the authority of Congress, and considering this application\r\non the grounds of reason alone, it would be best that our medium should\r\nbe so proportioned to our produce, as to be on a par with that of the\r\ncountries with which we trade, and whose medium is in a sound state:\r\nthat specie is the most perfect medium, because it will preserve its own\r\nlevel; because, having intrinsic and universal value, it can never die\r\nin our hands, and it is the surest resource of reliance in time of\r\nwar: that the trifling economy of paper, as a cheaper medium, or its\r\nconvenience for transmission, weighs nothing in opposition to the\r\nadvantages of the precious metals: that it is liable to be abused, has\r\nbeen, is, and for ever will be abused, in every country in which it is\r\npermitted; that it is already at a term of abuse in these States, which\r\nhas never been reached by any other nation, France excepted, whose\r\ndreadful catastrophe should be a warning against the instrument which\r\nproduced it: that we are already at ten or twenty times the due quantity\r\nof medium; insomuch, that no man knows what his property is now worth,\r\nbecause it is bloating while he is calculating; and still less what\r\nit will be worth when the medium shall be relieved from its present\r\ndropsical state: and that it is a palpable falsehood to say we can have\r\nspecie for our paper whenever demanded. Instead, then, of yielding to\r\nthe cries of scarcity of medium set up by speculators, projectors, and\r\ncommercial gamblers, no endeavors should be spared to begin the work of\r\nreducing it by such gradual means as may give time to private fortunes\r\nto preserve their poise, and settle down with the subsiding medium; and\r\nthat, for this purpose, the States should be urged to concede to the\r\nGeneral Government, with a saving of chartered rights, the exclusive\r\npower of establishing banks of discount for paper.\r\n\r\nTo the existence of banks of discount for cash, as on the continent of\r\nEurope, there can be no objection, because there can be no danger of\r\nabuse, and they are a convenience both to merchants and individuals.\r\nI think they should even be encouraged, by allowing them a larger than\r\nlegal, interest on short discounts, and tapering thence, in proportion\r\nas the term of discount is lengthened, down to legal interest on those\r\nof a year or more. Even banks of deposite, where cash should be lodged,\r\nand a paper acknowledgment taken out as its representative, entitled\r\nto a return of the cash on demand, would be convenient for remittances,\r\ntravelling persons, he. But, liable as its cash would be to be pilfered\r\nand robbed, and its paper to be fraudulently re-issued, or issued\r\nwithout deposite, it would require skilful and strict regulation. This\r\nwould differ from the bank of Amsterdam, in the circumstance that the\r\ncash could be re-demanded on returning the note.\r\n\r\nWhen I commenced this letter to you, my dear Sir, on Mr. Law’s memorial,\r\nI expected a short one would have answered that. But as I advanced, the\r\nsubject branched itself before me into so many collateral questions,\r\nthat even the rapid views I have taken of each have swelled the volume\r\nof my letter beyond my expectations, and, I fear, beyond your patience.\r\nYet on a revisal of it, I find no part which has not so much bearing on\r\nthe subject as to be worth merely the time of perusal. I leave it\r\nthen as it is; and will add only the assurances of my constant and\r\naffectionate esteem and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXIV.--TO JOHN ADAMS, October 13, 1813\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nMonticello, October 13, 1813.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nSince mine of August the 22nd, I have received your favors of August the\r\n16th, September the 2nd, 14th, 15th, and, and Mrs. Adams’s, of September\r\nthe 20th. I now send you, according to your request, a copy of the\r\nsyllabus. To fill up this skeleton with arteries, with veins, with\r\nnerves, muscles, and flesh, is really beyond my time and information.\r\nWhoever could undertake it, would find great aid in Enfield’s judicious\r\nabridgment of Brucker’s History of Philosophy, in which he has reduced\r\nfive or six quarto volumes, of one thousand pages each of Latin closely\r\nprinted, to two moderate octavos of English open type.\r\n\r\nTo compare the morals of the Old, with those of the New Testament, would\r\nrequire an attentive study of the former, a search through all its books\r\nfor its precepts, and through all its history for its practices, and the\r\nprinciples they prove. As commentaries, too, on these, the philosophy of\r\nthe Hebrews must be inquired into, their Mishna, their Gemara,\r\nCabbala, Jezirah, Sonar, Cosri, and their Talmud, must be examined and\r\nunderstood, in order to do them full justice. Brucker, it would seem,\r\nhas gone deeply into these repositories of their ethics, and Enfield his\r\nepitomizer, concludes in these words. ‘Ethics were so little understood\r\namong the Jews, that, in their whole compilation called the Talmud,\r\nthere is only one treatise on moral subjects. Their books of morals\r\nchiefly consisted in a minute enumeration of duties. From the law of\r\nMoses were deduced six hundred and thirteen precepts, which were divided\r\ninto two classes, affirmative and negative, two hundred and forty-eight\r\nin the former, and three hundred and sixty-five in the latter. It may\r\nserve to give the reader some idea of the low state of moral philosophy\r\namong the Jews in the middle age, to add, that of the two hundred\r\nand forty-eight affirmative precepts, only three were considered as\r\nobligatory upon women; and that, in order to obtain salvation, it was\r\njudged sufficient to fulfil any one single law in the hour of death;\r\nthe observance of the rest being deemed necessary, only to increase the\r\nfelicity of the future life. What a wretched depravity of sentiment\r\nand manners must have prevailed, before such corrupt maxims could have\r\nobtained credit! It is impossible to collect from these writings a\r\nconsistent series of moral doctrine. (Enfield, B. 4. chap. 3.) It\r\nwas the reformation of this wretched depravity of morals which Jesus\r\nundertook. In extracting the pure principles which he taught, we should\r\nhave to strip off the artificial vestments in which they have been\r\nmuffled by priests who have travestied them into various forms, as\r\ninstruments of riches and power to themselves. We must dismiss the\r\nPlatonists and Plotinists, the Stagyrites and Gamalielites, the\r\nEclectics, the Gnostics and Scholastics, their essences and emanations,\r\ntheir Logos and Demiurgos, Æons, and Daemons, male and female, with a\r\nlong train of &c. &c. &c. or, shall I say at once, of nonsense. We must\r\nreduce our volume to the simple evangelists, select, even from them, the\r\nvery words only of Jesus, paring off the amphiboligisms into which\r\nthey have been led, by forgetting often, or not understanding, what had\r\nfallen from him, by giving their own misconceptions as his dicta,\r\nand expressing unintelligibly for others what they had not understood\r\nthemselves. There will be found remaining the most sublime and\r\nbenevolent code of morals which has ever been offered to man. I have\r\nperformed this operation for my own use, by cutting verse by verse out\r\nof the printed book, and arranging the matter which is evidently his,\r\nand which is as easily distinguishable as diamonds, in a dunghill. The\r\nresult is an octavo of forty-six pages, of pure and unsophisticated\r\ndoctrines, such as were professed and acted on by the unlettered\r\nApostles, the Apostolic Fathers, and the Christians, of the first\r\ncentury. Their Platonizing successors, indeed, in after times, in order\r\nto legitimate the corruptions which they had incorporated into the\r\ndoctrines of Jesus, found it necessary to disavow the primitive\r\nChristians, who had taken their principles from the mouth of Jesus\r\nhimself, of his Apostles, and the Fathers cotemporary with them. They\r\nexcommunicated their followers as heretics, branding them with the\r\nopprobrious name of Ebionites and Beggars. For a comparison of the\r\nGrecian philosophy with that of Jesus, materials might be largely drawn\r\nfrom the same source. Enfield gives a history and detailed account of\r\nthe opinions and principles of the different sects. These relate to\r\nthe Gods, their natures, grades, places, and powers; the demi-Gods and\r\nDemons, and their agency with man; the universe, its structure, extent,\r\nand duration; the origin of things from the elements of fire, water,\r\nair, and earth; the human soul, its essence and derivation; the _summum\r\nbonum_, and _finis bonorum_; with a thousand idle dreams and fancies on\r\nthese and other subjects, the knowledge of which is withheld from man;\r\nleaving but a short chapter for his moral duties, and the principal\r\nsection of that given to what he owes himself, to precepts for\r\nrendering him impassible, and unassailable by the evils of life, and for\r\npreserving his mind in a state of constant serenity.\r\n\r\nSuch a canvass is too broad for the age of seventy, and especially of\r\none whose chief occupations have been in the practical business of life.\r\nWe must leave, therefore, to others, younger and more learned than\r\nwe are, to prepare this euthanasia for Platonic Christianity, and its\r\nrestoration to the primitive simplicity of its founder. I think you give\r\na just outline of the theism of the three religions, when you say that\r\nthe principle of the Hebrew was the fear, of the Gentile the honor, and\r\nof the Christian the love of God.\r\n\r\nAn expression in your letter of September the 14th, that ‘the human\r\nunderstanding is a revelation from its maker,’ gives the best solution\r\nthat I believe can be given of the question, ‘What did Socrates mean by\r\nhis Daemon?’ He was too wise to believe, and too honest to pretend, that\r\nhe had real and familiar converse with a superior and invisible being.\r\nHe probably considered the suggestions of his conscience, or reason,\r\nas revelations, or inspirations from the Supreme mind, bestowed, on\r\nimportant occasions, by a special superintending providence.\r\n\r\nI acknowledge all the merit of the hymn of Cleanthes to Jupiter, which\r\nyou ascribe to it. It is as highly sublime as a chaste and correct\r\nimagination can permit itself to go. Yet in the contemplation of a being\r\nso superlative, the hyperbolic flights of the Psalmist may often be\r\nfollowed with approbation, even with rapture; and I have no hesitation\r\nin giving him the palm over all the hymnists of every language, and of\r\nevery time. Turn to the 148th psalm in Brady and Tate’s version. Have\r\nsuch conceptions been ever before expressed? Their version of the 15th\r\npsalm is more to be esteemed for its pithiness than its poetry. Even\r\nSternhold, the leaden Sternhold, kindles, in a single instance, with the\r\nsublimity of his original, and expresses the majesty of God descending\r\non the earth, in terms not unworthy of the subject.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: page225]\r\n\r\nThe Latin versions of this passage by Buchanan and by Johnston, are but\r\nmediocres. But the Greek of Duport is worthy of quotation.\r\n\r\nThe best collection of these psalms is that of the Octagonian dissenters\r\nof Liverpool, in their printed form of prayer; but they are not always\r\nthe best versions. Indeed, bad is the best of the English versions; not\r\na ray of poetical genius having ever been employed on them. And how much\r\ndepends on this, may be seen by comparing Brady and Tate’s 15th psalm\r\nwith Blacklock’s _Justum et tenacem propositi virum_ of Horace, quoted\r\nin Hume’s History, Car. 2. ch. 66. A translation of David in this style,\r\nor in that of Pompei’s Cleanthes, might give us some idea of the merit\r\nof the original. The character, too, of the poetry of these hymns is\r\nsingular to us; written in monostichs, each divided into strophe\r\nand antistrophe, the sentiment of the first member responded with\r\namplification or antithesis in the second.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of the Postscript of yours of August the 16th and of Mrs.\r\nAdams’s letter, I am silent. I know the depth of the affliction it has\r\ncaused, and can sympathize with it the more sensibly, inasmuch as there\r\nis no degree of affliction, produced by the loss of those dear to us,\r\nwhich experience has not taught me to estimate. I have ever found time\r\nand silence the only medicine, and these but assuage, they never can\r\nsuppress, the deep-drawn sigh which recollection for ever brings\r\nup, until recollection and life are extinguished together. Ever\r\naffectionately yours.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXV.--TO JOHN ADAMS, October 28, 1813\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nMonticello, October 28, 1813.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nAccording to the reservation between us, of taking up one of the\r\nsubjects of our correspondence at a time, I turn to your letters of\r\nAugust the 16th and September the 2nd.\r\n\r\nThe passage you quote from Theognis, I think has an ethical rather than\r\na political object. The whole piece is a moral exhortation,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: page226]\r\n\r\nand this passage particularly seems to be a reproof to man, who,\r\nwhile with his domestic animals he is curious to improve the race, by\r\nemploying always the finest male, pays no attention to the improvement\r\nof his own race, but intermarries with the vicious, the ugly, or the\r\nold, for considerations of wealth or ambition. It is in conformity with\r\nthe principle adopted afterwards by the Pythagoreans, and expressed by\r\nOcellus in another form;\r\n\r\n[Illustration: page226a\r\n\r\nwhich, as literally as intelligibility will admit, may be thus\r\ntranslated; ‘Concerning the interprocreation of men, how, and of whom it\r\nshall be, in a perfect manner, and according to the laws of modesty and\r\nsanctity, conjointly, this is what I think right. First, to lay it down\r\nthat we do not commix for the sake of pleasure, but of the procreation\r\nof children. For the powers, the organs, and desires for coition have\r\nnot been given by God to man for the sake of pleasure, but for the\r\nprocreation of the race. For as it were incongruous for a mortal born\r\nto partake of divine life, the immortality of the race being taken away,\r\nGod fulfilled the purpose by making the generations uninterrupted\r\nand continuous. This, therefore, we are especially to lay down as a\r\nprinciple, that coition is not for the sake of pleasure.’ But nature,\r\nnot trusting to this moral and abstract motive, seems to have provided\r\nmore securely for the perpetuation of the species, by making it the\r\neffect of the _oestrum_ implanted in the constitution of both sexes.\r\nAnd not only has the commerce of love been indulged on this unhallowed\r\nimpulse, but made subservient also to wealth and ambition by marriages,\r\nwithout regard to the beauty, the healthiness, the understanding, or\r\nvirtue of the subject from which we are to breed. The selecting the best\r\nmale for a Haram of well chosen females, also, which Theognis seems\r\nto recommend from the example of our sheep and asses, would doubtless\r\nimprove the human, as it does the brute animal, and produce a race of\r\nveritable\r\n\r\n[Illustration: page227].\r\n\r\nFor experience proves, that the moral and physical qualities of man,\r\nwhether good or evil, are transmissible in a certain degree from father\r\nto son. But I suspect that the equal rights of men will rise up against\r\nthis privileged Solomon and his Haram, and oblige us to continue\r\nacquiescence under the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: page227a],\r\n\r\nwhich Theognis complains of, and to content ourselves with the\r\naccidental _aristoi_ produced by the fortuitous concourse of breeders.\r\nFor I agree with you, that there is a natural aristocracy among men.\r\nThe grounds of this are virtue and talents. Formerly, bodily powers\r\ngave place among the _aristoi_. But since the invention of gunpowder\r\nhas armed the weak as well as the strong with missile death,\r\nbodily strength, like beauty, good humor, politeness, and other\r\naccomplishments, has become but an auxiliary ground of distinction.\r\nThere is also an artificial aristocracy, founded on wealth and birth,\r\nwithout either virtue or talents; for with these it would belong to the\r\nfirst class. The natural aristocracy I consider as the most precious\r\ngift of nature, for the instruction, the trusts, and government of\r\nsociety. And, indeed, it would have been inconsistent in creation to\r\nhave formed man for the social state, and not to have provided virtue\r\nand wisdom enough to manage the concerns of the society. May we not even\r\nsay, that that form of government is the best, which provides the most\r\neffectually for a pure selection of these natural _aristoi_ into the\r\noffices of government? The artificial aristocracy is a mischievous\r\ningredient in government, and provision should be made to prevent its\r\nascendancy. On the question, what is the best provision, you and I\r\ndiffer; but we differ as rational friends, using the free exercise of\r\nour own reason, and mutually indulging its errors. You think it best\r\nto put the pseudo-aristoi into a separate chamber of legislation, where\r\nthey may be hindered from doing mischief by their co-ordinate branches,\r\nand where, also, they may be a protection to wealth against the Agrarian\r\nand plundering enterprises of the majority of the people. I think that\r\nto give them power in order to prevent them from doing mischief, is\r\narming them for it, and increasing instead of remedying the evil. For\r\nif the co-ordinate branches can arrest their action, so may they that of\r\nthe co-ordinates. Mischief may be done negatively as well as positively.\r\nOf this, a cabal in the Senate of the United States has furnished many\r\nproofs. Nor do I believe them necessary to protect the wealthy;\r\nbecause enough of these will find their way into every branch of the\r\nlegislation, to protect themselves. From fifteen to twenty legislatures\r\nof our own, in action for thirty years past, have proved that no fears\r\nof an equalization of property are to be apprehended from them. I think\r\nthe best remedy is exactly that provided by all our constitutions, to\r\nleave to the citizens the free election and separation of the _aristoi_\r\nfrom the _pseudo-aristoi_, of the wheat from the chaff. In general,\r\nthey will elect the really good and wise. In some instances, wealth may\r\ncorrupt, and birth blind them; but not in sufficient degree to endanger\r\nthe society.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that our difference of opinion may, in some measure, be\r\nproduced by a difference of character in those among whom we live. From\r\nwhat I have seen of Massachusetts and Connecticut myself, and still\r\nmore from what I have heard, and the character given of the former by\r\nyourself, (Vol. I, page 111,) who know them so much better, there seems\r\nto be in those two States a traditionary reverence for certain families,\r\nwhich has rendered the offices of government nearly hereditary in those\r\nfamilies. I presume that from an early period of your history, members\r\nof these families happening to possess virtue and talents, have honestly\r\nexercised them for the good of the people, and by their services have\r\nendeared their names to them. In coupling Connecticut with you, I mean\r\nit politically only, not morally. For having made the Bible the common\r\nlaw of their land, they seem to have modeled their morality on the story\r\nof Jacob and Laban. But although this hereditary succession to office\r\nwith you may, in some degree, be founded in real family merit, yet in a\r\nmuch higher degree, it has proceeded from your strict alliance of Church\r\nand State. These families are canonized in the eyes of the people on the\r\ncommon principle, ‘You tickle me, and I will tickle you.’ In Virginia,\r\nwe have nothing of this. Our clergy, before the revolution, having been\r\nsecured against rivalship by fixed salaries, did not give themselves the\r\ntrouble of acquiring influence over the people. Of wealth, there were\r\ngreat accumulations in particular families, handed down from generation\r\nto generation, under the English law of entails. But the only object\r\nof ambition for the wealthy was a seat in the King’s Council. All their\r\ncourt then was paid to the crown and its creatures; and they Philipized\r\nin all collisions between the King and the people. Hence they were\r\nunpopular; and that unpopularity continues attached to their names. A\r\nRandolph, a Carter, or a Burwell must have great personal superiority\r\nover a common competitor, to be elected by the people, even at this\r\nday. At the first session of our legislature after the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, we passed a law abolishing entails. And this was followed\r\nby one abolishing the privilege of primogeniture, and dividing the\r\nlands of intestates equally among all their children, or other\r\nrepresentatives. These laws, drawn by myself, laid the axe to the root\r\nof pseudo-aristocracy. And had another which I prepared been adopted by\r\nthe legislature, our work would have been complete. It was a bill for\r\nthe more general diffusion of learning. This proposed to divide every\r\ncounty into wards of five or six miles square, like your townships; to\r\nestablish in each ward a free school for reading, writing, and common\r\narithmetic; to provide for the annual selection of the best subjects\r\nfrom these schools, who might receive, at the public expense, a higher\r\ndegree of education at a district school; and from these district\r\nschools to select a certain number of the most promising subjects, to\r\nbe completed at an University, where all the useful sciences should\r\nbe taught. Worth and genius would thus have been sought out from every\r\ncondition of life, and completely prepared by education for defeating\r\nthe competition of wealth and birth for public trusts. My proposition\r\nhad, for a further object, to impart to these wards those portions of\r\nself-government for which they are best qualified, by confiding to them\r\nthe care of their poor, their roads, police, elections, the nomination\r\nof jurors, administration of justice in small cases, elementary\r\nexercises of militia; in short, to have made them little republics, with\r\na warden at the head of each, for all those concerns which, being under\r\ntheir eye, they would better manage than the larger republics of the\r\ncounty or State. A general call of ward-meetings by their wardens on the\r\nsame day through the State, would at any time produce the genuine sense\r\nof the people on any required point, and would enable the State to act\r\nin mass, as your people have so often done, and with so much effect, by\r\ntheir town-meetings. The law for religious freedom, which made a part of\r\nthis system, having put down the aristocracy of the clergy, and restored\r\nto the citizen the freedom of the mind, and those of entails and\r\ndescents nurturing an equality of condition among them, this on\r\neducation would have raised the mass of the people to the high ground\r\nof moral respectability necessary to their own safety, and to orderly\r\ngovernment; and would have completed the great object of qualifying them\r\nto select the veritable aristoi, for the trusts of government, to the\r\nexclusion of the pseudalists: and the same Theognis, who has furnished\r\nthe epigraphs of your two letters, assures us that\r\n\r\n[Illustration: page229]\r\n\r\nAlthough this law has not yet been acted on but in a small and\r\ninefficient degree, it is still considered as before the legislature,\r\nwith other bills of the revised code, not yet taken up, and I have great\r\nhope that some patriotic spirit will, at a favorable moment, call it up,\r\nand make it the key-stone of the arch of our government.\r\n\r\nWith respect to aristocracy, we should further consider, that before the\r\nestablishment of the American States, nothing was known to history\r\nbut the man of the old world, crowded within limits either small or\r\novercharged, and steeped in the vices which that situation generates. A\r\ngovernment adapted to such men would be one thing; but a very different\r\none, that for the man of these States. Here every one may have land to\r\nlabor for himself, if he chooses; or, preferring the exercise of any\r\nother industry, may exact for it such compensation as not only to afford\r\na comfortable subsistence, but wherewith to provide for a cessation\r\nfrom labor in old age. Every one, by his property or by his satisfactory\r\nsituation, is interested in the support of law and order. And such men\r\nmay safely and advantageously reserve to themselves a wholesome control\r\nover their public affairs, and a degree of freedom, which, in the hands\r\nof the canaille of the cities of Europe, would be instantly perverted\r\nto the demolition and destruction of every thing public and private. The\r\nhistory of the last twenty-five years of France, and of the last forty\r\nyears in America, nay, of its last two hundred years, proves the truth\r\nof both parts of this observation.\r\n\r\nBut even in Europe a change has sensibly taken place in the mind of man.\r\nScience had liberated the ideas of those who read and reflect, and\r\nthe American example had kindled feelings of right in the people. An\r\ninsurrection has consequently begun, of science, talents, and courage,\r\nagainst rank and birth, which have fallen into contempt. It has failed\r\nin its first effort, because the mobs of the cities, the instrument used\r\nfor its accomplishment, debased by ignorance, poverty, and vice, could\r\nnot be restrained to rational action. But the world will recover from\r\nthe panic of this first catastrophe. Science is progressive, and talents\r\nand enterprise on the alert. Resort may be had to the people of\r\nthe country, a more governable power from their principles and\r\nsubordination; and rank and birth and tinsel-aristocracy will finally\r\nshrink into insignificance, even there. This, however, we have no right\r\nto meddle with. It suffices for us, if the moral and physical condition\r\nof our own citizens qualifies them to select the able and good for the\r\ndirection of their government, with a recurrence of elections at such\r\nshort periods as will enable them to displace an unfaithful servant,\r\nbefore the mischief he meditates may be irremediable, I have thus\r\nstated my opinion on a point on which we differ, not with a view to\r\ncontroversy, for we are both too old to change opinions which are the\r\nresult of a long life of inquiry and reflection; but on the suggestion\r\nof a former letter of yours, that we ought not to die before we have\r\nexplained ourselves to each other. We acted in perfect harmony,\r\nthrough a long and perilous contest for our liberty and independence.\r\nA constitution has been acquired, which, though neither of us thinks\r\nperfect, yet both consider as competent to render our fellow-citizens\r\nthe happiest and the securest on whom the sun has ever shone. If we do\r\nnot think exactly alike as to its imperfections, it matters little to\r\nour country, which, after devoting to it long lives of disinterested\r\nlabor we have delivered over to our successors in life, who will be able\r\nto take care of it and of themselves.\r\n\r\nOf the pamphlet on aristocracy which has been sent to you, or who may be\r\nits author, I have heard nothing but through your letter. If the person\r\nyou suspect, it may be known from the quaint, mystical, and hyperbolical\r\nideas, involved in affected, newfangled, and pedantic terms, which stamp\r\nhis writings. Whatever it be, I hope your quiet is not to be affected at\r\nthis day by the rudeness or intemperance of scribblers; but that you may\r\ncontinue in tranquillity to live and to rejoice in the prosperity of\r\nour country, until it shall be your own wish to take your seat among the\r\n_aristoi_ who have gone before you.\r\n\r\nEver and affectionately yours.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXVI.--TO THOMAS LIEPER, January 1, 1814\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS LIEPER.\r\n\r\nMonticello, January 1, 1814.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI had hoped, when I retired from the business of the world, that I\r\nshould have been permitted to pass the evening of life in tranquillity,\r\nundisturbed by the peltings and passions of which the public papers\r\nare the vehicles. I see, however, that I have been dragged into the\r\nnewspapers by the infidelity of one with whom I was formerly intimate,\r\nbut who has abandoned the American principles out of which that intimacy\r\ngrew, and become the bigoted partisan of England, and malcontent of his\r\nown government. In a letter which he wrote me, he earnestly besought me\r\nto avail our country of the good understanding which subsisted between\r\nthe executive and myself, by recommending an offer of such terms to\r\nour enemy as might produce a peace, towards which he was confident that\r\nenemy was disposed. In my answer, I stated the aggressions, the insults,\r\nand injuries which England had been heaping on us for years, our long\r\nforbearance in the hope she might be led by time and reflection to a\r\nsounder view of her own interests, and of their connection with justice\r\nto us, the repeated propositions for accommodation made by us, and\r\nrejected by her, and at length her Prince Regent’s solemn proclamation\r\nto the world, that he would never repeal the orders in council as to\r\nus, until France should have revoked her illegal decrees as to all\r\nthe world, and her minister’s declaration to ours, that no admissible\r\nprecaution against the impressment of our seamen could be proposed: that\r\nthe unavoidable declaration of war which followed these was accompanied\r\nby advances for peace, on terms which no American could dispense with,\r\nmade through various channels, and unnoticed and unanswered through\r\nany: but that if he could suggest any other conditions which we ought\r\nto accept, and which had not been repeatedly offered and rejected, I was\r\nready to be the channel of their conveyance to the government: and, to\r\nshow him that neither that attachment to Bonaparte nor French influence,\r\nwhich they allege eternally without believing it, themselves, affected\r\nmy mind, I threw in the two little sentences, of the printed extract\r\nenclosed in your friendly favor of the 9th ultimo, and exactly these two\r\nlittle sentences, from a letter of two or three pages, he has thought\r\nproper to publish, naked, alone, and with my name, although other parts\r\nof the letter would have shown that I wished such limits only to the\r\nsuccesses of Bonaparte, as should not prevent his completely closing\r\nEurope against British manufactures and commerce; and thereby reducing\r\nher to just terms of peace with us.\r\n\r\nThus am I situated. I receive letters from all quarters, some from known\r\nfriends, some from those who write like friends, on various subjects.\r\nWhat am I to do? Am I to button myself up in Jesuitical reserve, rudely\r\ndeclining any answer, or answering in terms so unmeaning, as only\r\nto prove my distrust? Must I withdraw myself from all interchange of\r\nsentiment with the world? I cannot do this. It is at war with my habits\r\nand temper. I cannot act as if all men were unfaithful, because some are\r\nso; nor believe that all will betray me, because some do. I had rather\r\nbe the victim of occasional infidelities, than relinquish my general\r\nconfidence in the honesty of man.\r\n\r\nSo far as to the breach of confidence which has brought me into the\r\nnewspapers, with a view to embroil me with my friends, by a supposed\r\nseparation in opinion and principle from them. But it is impossible\r\nthere can be any difference of opinion among us on the two propositions\r\ncontained in these two little sentences, when explained, as they were\r\nexplained in the context from which they were insulated. That Bonaparte\r\nis an unprincipled tyrant, who is deluging the continent of Europe with\r\nblood, there is not a human being, not even the wife of his bosom, who\r\ndoes not see: nor can there, I think, be a doubt as to the line we ought\r\nto wish drawn between his successes and those of Alexander. Surely none\r\nof us wish to see Bonaparte conquer Russia, and lay thus at his feet the\r\nwhole continent of Europe. This done, England would be but a breakfast:\r\nand although I am free from the visionary fears which the votaries of\r\nEngland have affected to entertain, because I believe he cannot effect\r\nthe conquest of Europe; yet put all Europe into his hands, and he might\r\nspare such a force, to be sent in British ships, as I would as lieve\r\nnot have to encounter, when I see how much trouble a handful of British\r\nsoldiers in Canada has given us. No. It cannot be our interest that all\r\nEurope should be reduced to a single monarchy. The true line of\r\ninterest for us is, that Bonaparte should be able to effect the complete\r\nexclusion of England from the whole continent of Europe, in order, as\r\nthe same letter said, ‘by this peaceable engine of constraint, to make\r\nher renounce her views of dominion over the ocean, of permitting no\r\nother nation to navigate it but with her license, and on tribute to her,\r\nand her aggressions on the persons of our citizens who may choose to\r\nexercise their right of passing over that element.’ And this would be\r\neffected by Bonaparte’s succeeding so far as to close the Baltic against\r\nher. This success I wished him the last year, this I wish him this\r\nyear; but were he again advanced to Moscow, I should again wish him\r\nsuch disasters as would prevent his reaching Petersburg. And were the\r\nconsequences even to be the longer continuance of our war, I would\r\nrather meet them, than see the whole force of Europe wielded by a single\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nI have gone into this explanation, my friend, because I know you will\r\nnot carry my letter to the newspapers, and because I am willing\r\nto entrust to your discretion the explaining me to our honest\r\nfellow-laborers, and the bringing them to pause and reflect, if any of\r\nthem have not sufficiently reflected on the extent of the success we\r\nought to wish to Bonaparte, with a view to our own interests only; and\r\neven were we not men, to whom nothing human should be indifferent. But\r\nis our particular interest to make us insensible to all sentiments of\r\nmorality? Is it then become criminal, the moral wish that the torrents\r\nof blood this man is shedding in Europe, the sufferings of so many human\r\nbeings, good as ourselves, on whose necks he is trampling, the burnings\r\nof ancient cities, devastations of great countries, the destruction of\r\nlaw and order, and demoralization of the world, should be arrested, even\r\nif it should place our peace a little further distant? No. You and\r\nI cannot differ in wishing that Russia, and Sweden, and Denmark, and\r\nGermany, and Spain, and Portugal, and Italy, and even England, may\r\nretain their independence. And if we differ in our opinions about Towers\r\nand his four beasts and ten kingdoms, we differ as friends, indulging\r\nmutual errors, and doing justice to mutual sincerity and honesty. In\r\nthis spirit of sincere confidence and affection, I pray God to bless you\r\nhere and hereafter.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXVII.--TO DOCTOR WALTER JONES, January 2,1814\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR WALTER JONES.\r\n\r\nMonticello, January 2,1814.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of November the 25th reached this place December the 21st,\r\nhaving been near a month on the way. How this could happen I know not,\r\nas we have two mails a week both from Fredericksburg and Richmond. It\r\nfound me just returned from a long journey and absence, during which\r\nso much business had accumulated, commanding the first attentions, that\r\nanother week has been added to the delay.\r\n\r\nI deplore, with you, the putrid state into which our newspapers have\r\npassed, and the malignity, the vulgarity, and mendacious spirit of those\r\nwho write for them; and I enclose you a recent sample, the production of\r\na New England judge, as a proof of the abyss of degradation into which\r\nwe are fallen. These ordures are rapidly depraving the public taste, and\r\nlessening its relish for sound food. As vehicles of information, and\r\na curb on our functionaries, they have rendered themselves useless, by\r\nforfeiting all title to belief. That this has, in a great degree, been\r\nproduced by the violence and malignity of party spirit, I agree with\r\nyou; and I have read with great pleasure the paper you enclosed me on\r\nthat subject, which I now return. It is at the same time a perfect model\r\nof the style of discussion which candor and decency should observe,\r\nof the tone which renders difference of opinion even amiable, and a\r\nsuccinct, correct, and dispassionate history of the origin and progress\r\nof party among us. It might be incorporated, as it stands, and without\r\nchanging a word, into the history of the present epoch, and would give\r\nto posterity a fairer view of the times than they will probably derive\r\nfrom other sources. In reading it, with great satisfaction, there was\r\nbut a single passage where I wished a little more developement of a very\r\nsound and catholic idea; a single intercalation to rest it solidly on\r\ntrue bottom. It is near the end of the first page, where you make a\r\nstatement of genuine republican maxims; saying, ‘that the people ought\r\nto possess as much political power as can possibly consist with the\r\norder and security of society.’ Instead of this, I would say, ‘that\r\nthe people, being the only safe depository of power, should exercise in\r\nperson every function which their qualifications enable them to exercise\r\nconsistently with the order and security of society; that we now find\r\nthem equal to the election of those who shall be invested with\r\ntheir executive and legislative powers, and to act themselves in the\r\njudiciary, as judges in questions of fact; that the range of their\r\npowers ought to be enlarged,’ &c. This gives both the reason and\r\nexemplification of the maxim you express, ‘that they ought to possess as\r\nmuch political power,’ &c. I see nothing to correct either in your facts\r\nor principles.\r\n\r\nYou say that in taking General Washington on your shoulders, to bear him\r\nharmless through the federal coalition, you encounter a perilous topic.\r\nI do not think so. You have given the genuine history of the course of\r\nhis mind through the trying scenes in which it was engaged, and of the\r\nseductions by which it was deceived, but not depraved. I think I knew\r\nGeneral Washington intimately and thoroughly; and were I called on to\r\ndelineate his character, it should be in terms like these.\r\n\r\nHis mind was great and powerful, without being of the very first order;\r\nhis penetration strong, though not so acute as that of a Newton, Bacon,\r\nor Locke; and as far as he saw, no judgment was ever sounder. It was\r\nslow in operation, being little aided by invention or imagination, but\r\nsure in conclusion. Hence the common remark of his officers, of\r\nthe advantage he derived from councils of war, where, hearing all\r\nsuggestions, he selected whatever was best; and certainly no General\r\never planned his battles more judiciously. But if deranged during the\r\ncourse of the action, if any member of his plan was dislocated by sudden\r\ncircumstances, he was slow in a re-adjustment. The consequence was, that\r\nhe often failed in the field, and rarely against an enemy in station, as\r\nat Boston and York. He was incapable of fear, meeting personal dangers\r\nwith the calmest unconcern. Perhaps the strongest feature in his\r\ncharacter was prudence, never acting until every circumstance, every\r\nconsideration, was maturely weighed; refraining if he saw a doubt, but,\r\nwhen once decided, going through with his purpose, whatever obstacles\r\nopposed. His integrity was most pure, his justice the most inflexible I\r\nhave ever known, no motives of interest or consanguinity, of friendship\r\nor hatred, being able to bias his decision. He was, indeed, in every\r\nsense of the words, a wise, a good, and a great man. His temper was\r\nnaturally irritable and high-toned; but reflection and resolution had\r\nobtained a firm and habitual ascendancy over it. If ever, however, it\r\nbroke its bonds, he was most tremendous in his wrath. In his expenses he\r\nwas honorable, but exact; liberal in contributions to whatever promised\r\nutility; but frowning and unyielding on all visionary projects, and all\r\nunworthy calls on his charity. His heart was not warm in its affections;\r\nbut he exactly calculated every man’s value, and gave him a solid esteem\r\nproportioned to it. His person, you know, was fine, his stature exactly\r\nwhat one would wish, his deportment easy, erect, and noble; the best\r\nhorseman of his age, and the most, graceful figure that could be seen\r\non horseback. Although in the circle of his friends, where he might\r\nbe unreserved with safety, he took a free share in conversation,\r\nhis colloquial talents were not above mediocrity, possessing neither\r\ncopiousness of ideas, nor fluency of words. In public, when called on\r\nfor a sudden opinion, he was unready, short, and embarrassed. Yet he\r\nwrote readily, rather diffusely, in an easy and correct style. This\r\nhe had acquired by conversation with the world, for his education\r\nwas merely reading, writing, and common arithmetic, to which he added\r\nsurveying at a later day. His time was employed in action chiefly,\r\nreading little, and that only in agriculture and English history. His\r\ncorrespondence became necessarily extensive, and, with journalizing\r\nhis agricultural proceedings, occupied most of his leisure hours within\r\ndoors. On the whole, his character was, in its mass, perfect, in nothing\r\nbad, in few points indifferent; and it may truly be said, that never did\r\nnature and fortune combine more perfectly to make a man great, and to\r\nplace him in the same constellation with whatever worthies have merited\r\nfrom man an everlasting remembrance. For his was the singular destiny\r\nand merit, of leading the armies of his country successfully through an\r\narduous war, for the establishment of its independence; of conducting\r\nits councils through the birth of a government, new in its forms and\r\nprinciples, until it had settled down into a quiet and orderly train;\r\nand of scrupulously obeying the laws through the whole of his career,\r\ncivil and military, of which the history of the world furnishes no other\r\nexample. How, then, can it be perilous for you to take such a man on\r\nyour shoulders? I am satisfied the great body of republicans think of\r\nhim as I do. We were, indeed, dissatisfied with him on his ratification\r\nof the British treaty. But this was short-lived. We knew his honesty,\r\nthe wiles with which he was encompassed, and that age had already begun\r\nto relax the firmness of his purposes; and I am convinced he is more\r\ndeeply seated in the love and gratitude of the republicans, than in the\r\nPharisaical homage of the federal monarchists. For he was no monarchist\r\nfrom preference of his judgment. The soundness of that gave him correct\r\nviews of the rights of man, and his severe justice devoted him to them.\r\nHe has often declared to me that he considered our new constitution as\r\nan experiment on the practicability of republican government, and with\r\nwhat dose of liberty man could be trusted for his own good; that he was\r\ndetermined the experiment should have a fair trial, and would lose\r\nthe last drop of his blood in support of it. And these declarations he\r\nrepeated to me the oftener and the more pointedly, because he knew my\r\nsuspicions of Colonel Hamilton’s views, and probably had heard from\r\nhim the same declarations which I had, to wit, ‘that the British\r\nconstitution, with its unequal representation, corruption, and other\r\nexisting abuses, was the most perfect government which had ever been\r\nestablished on earth, and that a reformation of these abuses would make\r\nit an impracticable government.’ I do believe that General Washington\r\nhad not a firm confidence in the durability of our government. He was\r\nnaturally distrustful of men, and inclined to gloomy apprehensions:\r\nand I was ever persuaded that a belief that we must at length end in\r\nsomething like a British constitution, had some weight in his adoption\r\nof the ceremonies of levees, birthdays, pompous meetings with Congress,\r\nand other forms of the same character, calculated to prepare us\r\ngradually for a change which he believed possible, and to let it come on\r\nwith as little shock as might be to the public mind.\r\n\r\nThese are my opinions of General Washington, which I would vouch at the\r\njudgment-seat of God, having been formed on an acquaintance of thirty\r\nyears. I served with him in the Virginia legislature from 1769 to the\r\nRevolutionary war, and again, a short time in Congress, until he left us\r\nto take command of the army. During the war and after it we corresponded\r\nOccasionally, and in the four years of my continuance in the office\r\nof Secretary of State, our intercourse was daily, confidential, and\r\ncordial. After I retired from that office, great and malignant pains\r\nwere taken by our federal monarchists, and not entirely without\r\neffect, to make him view me as a theorist, holding French principles of\r\ngovernment, which would lead infallibly to licentiousness and anarchy.\r\nAnd to this he listened the more easily, from my known disapprobation\r\nof the British treaty. I never saw him afterwards, or these malignant\r\ninsinuations should have been dissipated before his just judgment, as\r\nmists before the sun. I felt on his death, with my countrymen, that\r\n‘verily a great man hath fallen this day in Israel.’\r\n\r\nMore time and recollection would enable me to add many other traits of\r\nhis character; but why add them to you, who knew him well? And I cannot\r\njustify to myself a longer detention of your paper.\r\n\r\n_Vale, proprieque tuum me esse tibi persuadeas_.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXVIII.--TO JOSEPH C. CABELL, January 31, 1814\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH C. CABELL.\r\n\r\nMonticello, January 31, 1814.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of the 23d is received. Say had come to hand safely. But I\r\nregretted having asked the return of him; for I did not find in him one\r\nnew idea on the subject I had been contemplating; nothing more than a\r\nsuccinct, judicious digest of the tedious pages of Smith.\r\n\r\nYou ask my opinion on the question, whether the States can add any\r\nqualifications to those which the constitution has prescribed for their\r\nmembers of Congress? It is a question I had never before reflected on;\r\nyet had taken up an off-hand opinion, agreeing with your first,\r\nthat they could not: that to add new qualifications to those of the\r\nconstitution, would be as much an alteration, as to detract from them.\r\nAnd so I think the House of Representatives of Congress decided in some\r\ncase; I believe that of a member from Baltimore. But your letter having\r\ninduced me to look into the constitution, and to consider the question\r\na little, I am again in your predicament, of doubting the correctness of\r\nmy first opinion. Had the constitution been silent, nobody can doubt but\r\nthat the right to prescribe all the qualifications and disqualifications\r\nof those they would send to represent them, would have belonged to the\r\nState. So also the constitution might have prescribed the whole, and\r\nexcluded all others. It seems to have preferred the middle way. It has\r\nexercised the power in part, by declaring some disqualifications, to\r\nwit, those of not being twenty-five years of age, of not having been a\r\ncitizen seven years, and of not being an inhabitant of the State at the\r\ntime of election. But it does not declare, itself, that the member shall\r\nnot be a lunatic, a pauper, a convict of treason, of murder, of felony,\r\nor other infamous crime, or a non-resident of his district; nor does\r\nit prohibit to the State the power of declaring these, or any other\r\ndisqualifications which its particular circumstances may call for: and\r\nthese may be different in different States. Of course, then, by the\r\ntenth amendment, the power is reserved to the State. If, wherever the\r\nconstitution assumes a single power out of many which belong to the same\r\nsubject, we should consider it as assuming the whole, it would vest\r\nthe General Government with a mass of powers never contemplated. On the\r\ncontrary, the assumption of particular powers seems an exclusion of all\r\nnot assumed. This reasoning appears to me to be sound; but, on so recent\r\na change of view, caution requires us not to be too confident, and that\r\nwe admit this to be one of the doubtful questions on which honest men\r\nmay differ with the purest motives; and the more readily, as we find we\r\nhave differed from ourselves on it.\r\n\r\nI have always thought, that where the line of demarcation between\r\nthe powers of the General and State governments was doubtfully or\r\nindistinctly drawn, it would be prudent and praiseworthy in both\r\nparties, never to approach it but under the most urgent necessity.\r\nIs the necessity now urgent, to declare that no non-resident of his\r\ndistrict shall be eligible as a member of Congress? It seems to me that,\r\nin practice, the partialities of the people are a sufficient security\r\nagainst such an election; and that if, in any instance, they should\r\never choose a non-resident, it must be in one of such eminent merit and\r\nqualifications, as would make it a good, rather than an evil; and that,\r\nin any event, the examples will be so rare, as never to amount to a\r\nserious evil. If the case then be neither clear nor urgent, would it not\r\nbe better to let it lie undisturbed? Perhaps its decision may never\r\nbe called for. But if it be indispensable to establish this\r\ndisqualification now, would it not look better to declare such others,\r\nat the same time, as may be proper? I frankly confide to yourself these\r\nopinions, or rather no-opinions, of mine; but would not wish to have\r\nthem go any farther. I want to be quiet: and although some circumstances\r\nnow and then excite me to notice them, I feel safe, and happier in\r\nleaving events to those whose turn it is to take care of them; and, in\r\ngeneral, to let it be understood, that I meddle little or not at all\r\nwith public affairs. There are two subjects, indeed, which I shall claim\r\na right to further as long as I breathe, the public education and the\r\nsubdivision of the counties into wards. I consider the continuance of\r\nrepublican government as absolutely hanging on these two hooks. Of the\r\nfirst, you will, I am sure, be an advocate, as having already\r\nreflected on it, and of the last, when you shall have reflected. Ever\r\naffectionately yours.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXIX.--TO JOHN ADAMS, July 5, 1814\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nMonticello, July 5, 1814\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nSince mine of January the 24th, yours of March the 14th has been\r\nreceived. It was not acknowledged in the short one of May the 18th, by\r\nMr. Rives, the only object of that having been to enable one of our most\r\npromising young men to have the advantage of making his bow to you. I\r\nlearned with great regret the serious illness mentioned in your letter;\r\nand I hope Mr. Rives will be able to tell me you are entirely restored.\r\nBut our machines have now been running seventy or eighty years, and we\r\nmust expect that, worn as they are, here a pivot, there a wheel, now\r\na pinion, next a spring, will be giving way; and however we may tinker\r\nthem up for a while, all will at length surcease motion. Our watches,\r\nwith works of brass and steel, wear out within that period. Shall you\r\nand I last to see the course the seven-fold wonders of the times will\r\ntake? The Attila of the age dethroned, the ruthless destroyer of\r\nten millions of the human race, whose thirst for blood appeared\r\nunquenchable, the great oppressor of the rights and liberties of\r\nthe world, shut up within the circuit of a little island of the\r\nMediterranean, and dwindled to the condition of an humble and degraded\r\npensioner on the bounty of those he has most injured. How miserably, how\r\nmeanly, has he closed his inflated career! What a sample of the bathos\r\nwill his history present! He should have perished on the swords of his\r\nenemies, under the walls of Paris.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: page240]\r\n\r\nBut Bonaparte was a lion in the field only. In civil life, a\r\ncold-blooded, calculating, unprincipled usurper, without a virtue; no\r\nstatesman, knowing nothing of commerce, political economy, or civil\r\ngovernment, and supplying ignorance by bold presumption. I had supposed\r\nhim a great man until his entrance into the Assembly _des Cinq Cens_,\r\neighteenth _Brumaire_ (an 8.) From that date, however, I set him down as\r\na great scoundrel only. To the wonders of his rise and fall, we may add\r\nthat of a Czar of Muscovy, dictating, in Paris, laws and limits to all\r\nthe successors of the Caesars, and holding even the balance in which the\r\nfortunes of this new world are suspended. I own, that while I rejoice,\r\nfor the good of mankind, in the deliverance of Europe from the havoc\r\nwhich would have never ceased while Bonaparte should have lived in\r\npower, I see with anxiety the tyrant of the ocean remaining in vigor,\r\nand even participating in the merit of crushing his brother tyrant.\r\nWhile the world is thus turned upside down, on which side of it are\r\nwe? All the strong reasons, indeed, place us on the side of peace; the\r\ninterests of the continent, their friendly dispositions, and even the\r\ninterests of England. Her passions alone are opposed to it. Peace would\r\nseem now to be an easy work, the causes of the war being removed. Her\r\norders of council will no doubt be taken care of by the allied powers,\r\nand, war ceasing, her impressment of our seamen ceases of course. But I\r\nfear there is foundation for the design intimated in the public\r\npapers, of demanding a cession of our right in the fisheries. What will\r\nMassachusetts say to this? I mean her majority, which must be considered\r\nas speaking through the organs it has appointed itself, as the index of\r\nits will. She chose to sacrifice the liberty of our sea-faring citizens,\r\nin which we were all interested, and with them her obligations to the\r\nco-States, rather than war with England. Will she now sacrifice the\r\nfisheries to the same partialities? This question is interesting to her\r\nalone; for to the middle, the southern, and western States, they are\r\nof no direct concern; of no more than the culture of tobacco, rice, and\r\ncotton to Massachusetts. I am really at a loss to conjecture what our\r\nrefractory sister will say on this occasion. I know what, as a citizen\r\nof the Union, I would say to her. ‘Take this question ad referendum. It\r\nconcerns you alone. If you would rather, give up the fisheries than war\r\nwith England, we give them up. If you had rather fight for them, we will\r\ndefend your interests to the last drop of our blood, choosing rather to\r\nset a good example than follow a bad one.’ And I hope she will determine\r\nto fight for them. With this, however, you and I shall have nothing\r\nto do; ours being truly the case wherein ‘_Non tali auxilio, nec\r\ndefensoribus istis, tempus eget_.’ Quitting this subject, therefore, I\r\nwill turn over another leaf.\r\n\r\nI am just returned from one of my long absences, having been at my\r\nother home for five weeks past. Having more leisure there than here for\r\nreading, I amused myself with reading seriously Plato’s Republic. I\r\nam wrong, however, in calling it amusement, for it was the heaviest\r\ntask-work I ever went through. I had occasionally before taken up some\r\nof his other works, but scarcely ever had patience to go through a\r\nwhole dialogue. While wading through the whimsies, the puerilities, and\r\nunintelligible jargon of this work, I laid it down often to ask myself,\r\nhow it could have been that the world should have so long consented to\r\ngive reputation to such nonsense as this. How the soi-disant Christian\r\nworld, indeed, should have done it, is a piece of historical curiosity.\r\nBut how could the Roman good sense do it? And particularly, how could\r\nCicero bestow such eulogies on Plato? Although Cicero did not wield\r\nthe dense logic of Demosthenes, yet he was able, learned, laborious,\r\npractised in the business of the world and honest. He could not be the\r\ndupe of mere style, of which he was himself the first master in the\r\nworld. With the moderns, I think, it is rather a matter of fashion and\r\nauthority. Education is chiefly in the hands of persons who, from their\r\nprofession, have an interest in the reputation and the dreams of Plato.\r\nThey give the tone while at school, and few in their after years have\r\noccasion to revise their college opinions. But fashion and authority\r\napart, and bringing Plato to the test of reason, take from him, his\r\nsophisms, futilities, and incomprehensibilities, and what remains? In\r\ntruth, he is one of the race of genuine sophists, who has escaped the\r\noblivion of his brethren, first, by the elegance of his diction, but\r\nchiefly by the adoption and incorporation of his whimsies into the body\r\nof artificial Christianity. His foggy mind is for ever presenting the\r\nsemblances of objects which, half seen through a mist, can be defined\r\nneither in form nor dimension. Yet this, which should have consigned\r\nhim to early oblivion, really procured him immortality of fame and\r\nreverence. The Christian priesthood, finding the doctrines of Christ\r\nlevelled to every understanding, and too plain to need explanation, saw\r\nin the mysticisms of Plato materials with which they might build up\r\nan artificial system, which might, from its indistinctness, admit\r\neverlasting controversy, give employment for their order, and introduce\r\nit to profit, power, and pre-eminence. The doctrines which flowed from\r\nthe lips of Jesus himself are within the comprehension of a child; but\r\nthousands of volumes have not yet explained the Platonisms engrafted on\r\nthem: and for this obvious reason, that nonsense can never be explained.\r\nTheir purposes, however, are answered. Plato is canonized: and it is\r\nnow deemed as impious to question his merits as those of an Apostle of\r\nJesus. He is peculiarly appealed to as an advocate of the immortality\r\nof the soul; and yet I will venture to say, that were there no better\r\narguments than his in proof of it, not a man in the world would believe\r\nit. It is fortunate for us, that Platonic republicanism has not obtained\r\nthe same favor as Platonic Christianity; or we should now have been all\r\nliving, men, women, and children, pell-mell together, like the beasts\r\nof the field or forest. Yet ‘Plato is a great philosopher,’ said La\r\nFontaine. But, says Fontenelle, ‘Do you find his ideas very clear.’ ‘Oh,\r\nno! he is of an obscurity impenetrable.’ ‘Do you not find him full\r\nof contradictions?’ ‘Certainly,’ replied La Fontaine, ‘he is but a\r\nsophist.’ Yet immediately after, he exclaims again, ‘Oh, Plato was a\r\ngreat philosopher.’ Socrates had reason, indeed, to complain of the\r\nmisrepresentations of Plato; for, in truth, his dialogues are libels on\r\nSocrates.\r\n\r\nBut why am I dosing you with these antediluvian topics? Because I\r\nam glad to have some one to whom they are familiar, and who will not\r\nreceive them as if dropped from the moon. Our post-revolutionary youth\r\nare born under happier stars than you and I were. They acquire all\r\nlearning in their mother’s womb, and bring it into the world ready made.\r\nThe information of books is no longer necessary; and all knowledge which\r\nis not innate is in contempt, or neglect at least. Every folly must\r\nrun its round; and so, I suppose, must that of self-learning and\r\nself-sufficiency; of rejecting the knowledge acquired in past ages, and\r\nstarting on the new ground of intuition. When sobered by experience,\r\nI hope our successors will turn their attention to the advantages of\r\neducation. I mean of education on the broad scale, and not that of the\r\npetty academies, as they call themselves, which are starting up in every\r\nneighborhood, and where one or two men, possessing Latin, and sometimes\r\nGreek, a knowledge of the globes, and the first six books of Euclid,\r\nimagine and communicate this as the sum of science. They commit their\r\npupils to the theatre of the world, with just taste enough of learning\r\nto be alienated from industrious pursuits, and not enough to do service\r\nin the ranks of science. We have some exceptions, indeed. I presented\r\none to you lately, and we have some others. But the terms I use are\r\ngeneral truths. I hope the necessity will, at length, be seen of\r\nestablishing institutions here, as in Europe, where every branch of\r\nscience, useful at this day, may be taught in its highest degree. Have\r\nyou ever turned your thoughts to the plan of such an institution? I\r\nmean to a specification of the particular sciences of real use in\r\nhuman affairs, and how they might be so grouped as to require so many\r\nprofessors only, as might bring them within the views of a just but\r\nenlightened economy? I should be happy in a communication of your ideas\r\non this problem, either loose or digested. But to avoid my being run\r\naway with by another subject, and adding to the length and ennui of\r\nthe present letter, I will here present to Mrs. Adams and yourself, the\r\nassurance of my constant and sincere friendship and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXX.--TO COLONEL MONROE, January 1, 1815\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\nMonticello, January 1, 1815.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour letters of November the 30th and December the 21st have been\r\nreceived with great pleasure. A truth now and then projecting into the\r\nocean of newspaper lies, serves like headlands to correct our course.\r\nIndeed, my scepticism as to every thing I see in a newspaper, makes me\r\nindifferent whether I ever see one. The embarrassments at Washington, in\r\nAugust last, I expected would be great in any state of things; but they\r\nproved greater than expected. I never doubted that the plans of the\r\nPresident were wise and sufficient. Their failure we all impute, 1.\r\nTo the insubordinate temper of Armstrong: and, 2. To the indecision of\r\nWinder. However, it ends well. It mortifies ourselves, and so may check,\r\nperhaps, the silly boasting spirit of our newspapers, and it enlists the\r\nfeelings of the world on our side: and the advantage of public opinion\r\nis like that of the weather-gage in a naval action. In Europe, the\r\ntransient possession of our Capital can be no disgrace. Nearly every\r\nCapital there was in possession of its enemy some often and long. But\r\ndiabolical as they paint that enemy, he burnt neither public edifices\r\nnor private dwellings. It was reserved for England to show that\r\nBonaparte, in atrocity, was an infant to their ministers and their\r\ngenerals. They are taking his place in the eyes of Europe, and have\r\nturned into our channel all its good will. This will be worth the\r\nmillion of dollars the repairs of their conflagrations will cost us.\r\nI hope that to preserve this weather-gage of public opinion, and to\r\ncounteract the slanders and falsehoods disseminated by the English\r\npapers, the government will make it a standing instruction to\r\ntheir ministers at foreign courts, to keep Europe truly informed of\r\noccurrences here, by publishing in their papers the naked truth always,\r\nwhether favorable or unfavorable. For they will believe the good, if we\r\ncandidly tell them the bad also.\r\n\r\nBut you have two more serious causes of uneasiness; the want of men and\r\nmoney. For the former, nothing more wise or efficient could have been\r\nimagined than what you proposed. It would have filled our ranks with\r\nregulars, and that, too, by throwing a just share of the burthen on the\r\npurses of those whose persons are exempt either by age or office; and it\r\nwould have rendered our militia, like those of the Greeks and Romans,\r\na nation of warriors. But the go-by seems to have been given to your\r\nproposition, and longer sufferance is necessary to force us to what is\r\nbest. We seem equally incorrigible in our financial course. Although a\r\ncentury of British experience has proved to what a wonderful extent the\r\nfunding on specific redeeming taxes enables a nation to anticipitate\r\nin war the resources of peace, and although the other nations of Europe\r\nhave tried and trodden every path of force or folly in fruitless quest\r\nof the same object, yet we still expect to find, in juggling tricks and\r\nbanking dreams, that money can be made out of nothing, and in sufficient\r\nquantity to meet the expenses of a heavy war by sea and land. It is\r\nsaid, indeed, that money cannot be borrowed from our merchants as from\r\nthose of England. But it can be borrowed from our people. They will give\r\nyou all the necessaries of war they produce, if, instead of the bankrupt\r\ntrash they now are obliged to receive for want of any other, you will\r\ngive them a paper-promise funded on a specific pledge, and of a size for\r\ncommon circulation. But you say the merchants will not take this paper.\r\nWhat the people take the merchants must take, or sell nothing. All these\r\ndoubts and fears prove only the extent of the dominion which the\r\nbanking institutions have obtained over the minds of our citizens, and\r\nespecially of those inhabiting cities or other banking places; and this\r\ndominion must be broken, or it will break us. But here, as in the other\r\ncase, we must make up our mind to suffer yet longer before we can\r\nget right. The misfortune is, that in the mean time, we shall plunge\r\nourselves into inextinguishable debt, and entail on our posterity an\r\ninheritance of eternal taxes, which will bring our government and people\r\ninto the condition of those of England, a nation of pikes and gudgeons,\r\nthe latter bred merely as food for the former. But, however these two\r\ndifficulties of men and money may be disposed of, it is fortunate that\r\nneither of them will affect our war by sea. Privateers will find their\r\nown men and money. Let nothing be spared to encourage them. They are the\r\ndagger which strikes at the heart of the enemy, their commerce. Frigates\r\nand seventy-fours are a sacrifice we must make, heavy as it is, to the\r\nprejudices of a part of our citizens. They have, indeed, rendered a\r\ngreat moral service, which has delighted me as much as any one in the\r\nUnited States. But they have had no physical effect sensible to the\r\nenemy; and now, while we must fortify them in our harbors, and keep\r\narmies to defend them, our privateers are bearding and blockading the\r\nenemy in their own sea-ports. Encourage them to burn all their prizes,\r\nand let the public pay for them. They will cheat us enormously. No\r\nmatter; they will make the merchants of England feel, and squeal, and\r\ncry out for peace.\r\n\r\nI much regretted your acceptance of the war department. Not that I know\r\na person who I think would better conduct it. But, conduct it ever so\r\nwisely, it will be a sacrifice of yourself. Were an angel from Heaven\r\nto undertake that office, all our miscarriages would be ascribed to\r\nhim. Raw troops, no troops, insubordinate militia, want of arms, want of\r\nmoney, want of provisions, all will be charged to want of management in\r\nyou. I speak from experience, when I was Governor of Virginia. Without a\r\nregular in the State, and scarcely a musket to put into the hands of\r\nthe militia, invaded by two armies, Arnold’s from the sea-board, and\r\nCornwallis’s from the southward,--when we were driven from Richmond and\r\nCharlottesville, and every member of my council fled to their homes, it\r\nwas not the total destitution of means, but the mismanagement of them,\r\nwhich, in the querulous voice of the public, caused all our misfortunes.\r\nIt ended, indeed, in the capture of the whole hostile force, but not\r\ntill means were brought us by General Washington’s army, and the French\r\nfleet and army. And although the legislature, who were personally\r\nintimate with both the means and measures, acquitted me with justice and\r\nthanks, yet General Lee has put all those imputations among the\r\nromances of his historical novel, for the amusement of credulous and\r\nuninquisitive readers. Not that I have seen the least disposition to\r\ncensure you. On the contrary, your conduct on the attack of Washington\r\nhas met the praises of every one, and your plan for regulars and\r\nmilitia, their approbation. But no campaign is as yet opened. No\r\ngenerals have yet an interest in shifting their own incompetence on you,\r\nno army agents, their rogueries. I sincerely pray you may never meet\r\ncensure where you will deserve most praise, and that your own happiness\r\nand prosperity may be the result of your patriotic services.\r\n\r\nEver and affectionately yours.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXI.--TO THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE, February 14, 1815\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE.\r\n\r\nMonticello, February 14, 1815.\r\n\r\nMr Dear Friend,\r\n\r\nYour letter of August the 14th has been received and read, again and\r\nagain, with extraordinary pleasure. It is the first glimpse which has\r\nbeen furnished me of the interior workings of the late unexpected but\r\nfortunate revolution of your country. The newspapers told us only that\r\nthe great beast was fallen; but what part in this the patriots acted,\r\nand what the egoists, whether the former slept while the latter were\r\nawake to their own interests only, the hireling scribblers of the\r\nEnglish press said little, and knew less. I see now the mortifying\r\nalternative under which the patriot there is placed, of being either\r\nsilent, or disgraced by an association in opposition with the remains\r\nof Bonaparteism. A full measure of liberty is not now perhaps to\r\nbe expected by your nation; nor am I confident they are prepared\r\nto preserve it. More than a generation will be requisite, under the\r\nadministration of reasonable laws favoring the progress of knowledge in\r\nthe general mass of the people, and their habituation to an independent\r\nsecurity of person and property, before they will be capable of\r\nestimating the value of freedom, and the necessity of a sacred adherence\r\nto the principles on which it rests for preservation. Instead of that\r\nliberty which takes root and growth in the progress of reason, if\r\nrecovered by mere force or accident, it becomes, with an unprepared\r\npeople, a tyranny still, of the many, the few, or the one. Possibly you\r\nmay remember, at the date of the _jeu de paume_, how earnestly I urged\r\nyourself and the patriots of my acquaintance to enter then into a\r\ncompact with the King, securing freedom of religion, freedom of the\r\npress, trial by jury, habeas corpus, and a national legislature, all of\r\nwhich it was known he would then yield, to go home, and let these work\r\non the amelioration of the condition of the people, until they should\r\nhave rendered them capable of more, when occasions would not fail to\r\narise for communicating to them more. This was as much as I then thought\r\nthem able to bear, soberly and usefully for themselves. You thought\r\notherwise, and that the dose might still be larger. And I found you were\r\nright; for subsequent events proved they were equal to the constitution\r\nof 1791. Unfortunately, some of the most honest and enlightened of our\r\npatriotic friends (but closet politicians merely, unpractised in the\r\nknowledge of man) thought more could still be obtained and borne. They\r\ndid not weigh the hazards of a transition from one form of government to\r\nanother, the value of what they had already rescued from those hazards,\r\nand might hold in security if they pleased, nor the imprudence of giving\r\nup the certainty of such a degree of liberty, under a limited monarch,\r\nfor the uncertainty of a little more under the form of a republic. You\r\ndiffered from them. You were for stopping there, and for securing the\r\nconstitution which the National Assembly had obtained. Here, too, you\r\nwere right; and from this fatal error of the republicans, from their\r\nseparation from yourself and the constitutionalists, in their councils,\r\nflowed all the subsequent sufferings and crimes of the French nation.\r\nThe hazards of a second change fell upon them by the way. The foreigner\r\ngained time to anarchize by gold the government he could not overthrow\r\nby arms, to crush in their own councils the genuine republicans, by the\r\nfraternal embraces of exaggerated and hired pretenders, and to turn the\r\nmachine of Jacobinism from the change to the destruction of order: and,\r\nin the end, the limited monarchy they had secured was exchanged for\r\nthe unprincipled and bloody tyranny of Robespierre, and the equally\r\nunprincipled and maniac tyranny of Bonaparte. You are now rid of him,\r\nand I sincerely wish you may continue so. But this may depend on the\r\nwisdom and moderation of the restored dynasty. It is for them now to\r\nread a lesson in the fatal errors of the republicans; to be contented\r\nwith a certain portion of power, secured by formal compact with the\r\nnation, rather than, grasping at more, hazard all upon uncertainty, and\r\nrisk meeting the fate of their predecessor, or a renewal of their own\r\nexile. We are just informed, too, of an example which merits, if true,\r\ntheir most profound contemplation. The gazettes say, that Ferdinand of\r\nSpain is dethroned, and his father re-established on the basis of their\r\nnew constitution. This order of magistrates must, therefore, see, that\r\nalthough the attempts at reformation have not succeeded in their whole\r\nlength, and some secession from the ultimate point has taken place, yet\r\nthat men have by no means fallen back to their former passiveness; but\r\non the contrary, that a sense of their rights, and a restlessness to\r\nobtain them, remain deeply impressed on every mind, and, if not quieted\r\nby reasonable relaxations of power, will break out like a volcano on\r\nthe first occasion, and overwhelm every thing again in its way. I always\r\nthought the present King an honest and moderate man: and having\r\nno issue, he is under a motive the less for yielding to personal\r\nconsiderations. I cannot, therefore, but hope, that the patriots in and\r\nout of your legislature, acting in phalanx, but temperately and wisely,\r\npressing unremittingly the principles omitted in the late capitulation\r\nof the King, and watching the occasions which the course of events will\r\ncreate, may get those principles engrafted into it, and sanctioned by\r\nthe solemnity of a national act.\r\n\r\nWith us the affairs of war have taken the more favorable turn which\r\nwas to be expected. Our thirty years of peace had taken off, or\r\nsuperannuated, all our revolutionary officers of experience and grade;\r\nand our first draught in the lottery of untried characters had been\r\nmost unfortunate. The delivery of the fort and army of Detroit, by the\r\ntraitor Hull; the disgrace at Queenstown, under Van Rensellaer; the\r\nmassacre at Frenchtown, under Winchester; and surrender of Boerstler\r\nin an open field to one third of his own numbers, were the inauspicious\r\nbeginnings of the first year of our warfare. The second witnessed but\r\nthe single miscarriage occasioned by the disagreement of Wilkinson and\r\nHampton, mentioned in my letter to you of November the 30th, 1813; while\r\nit gave us the capture of York by Dearborn and Pike; the capture of Fort\r\nGeorge by Dearborn also; the capture of Proctor’s army on the Thames by\r\nHarrison, Shelby, and Johnson; and that of the whole British fleet\r\non Lake Erie by Perry. The third year has been a continued series of\r\nvictories; to wit, of Brown and Scott at Chippeway; of the same at\r\nNiagara; of Gaines over Drummond at Fort Erie; that of Brown over\r\nDrummond at the same place; the capture of another fleet on Lake\r\nChamplain by M’Donough; the entire defeat of their army under Prevost,\r\non the same day, by M’Comb, and recently their defeats at New Orleans by\r\nJackson, Coffee, and Carroll, with the loss of four thousand men out of\r\nnine thousand and six hundred, with their two Generals, Packingham and\r\nGibbs killed, and a third, Keane, wounded, mortally, as is said.\r\n\r\nThis series of successes has been tarnished only by the conflagrations\r\nat Washington, a _coup de main_ differing from that at Richmond, which\r\nyou remember, in the revolutionary war, in the circumstance only, that\r\nwe had, in that case, but forty-eight hour’s notice that an enemy had\r\narrived within our capes; whereas at Washington there was abundant\r\nprevious notice. The force designated by the President was the double of\r\nwhat was necessary; but failed, as is the general opinion, through\r\nthe insubordination of Armstrong, who would never believe the attack\r\nintended until it was actually made, and the sluggishness of Winder\r\nbefore the occasion, and his indecision during it. Still, in the end,\r\nthe transaction has helped rather than hurt us, by arousing the general\r\nindignation of our country, and by marking to the world of Europe the\r\nVandalism and brutal character of the English government. It has merely\r\nserved to immortalize their infamy. And add further, that through the\r\nwhole period of the war, we have beaten them single-handed at sea, and\r\nso thoroughly established our superiority over them with equal force,\r\nthat they retire from that kind of contest, and never suffer their\r\nfrigates to cruise singly. The Endymion would never have engaged the\r\nfrigate President, but knowing herself backed by three frigates and\r\na razee, who, though somewhat slower sailors, would get up before she\r\ncould be taken. The disclosure to the world of the fatal secret that\r\nthey can be beaten at sea with an equal force, the evidence furnished by\r\nthe military operations of the last year that experience is rearing us\r\nofficers, who, when our means shall be fully under way, will plant our\r\nstandard on the walls of Quebec and Halifax, their recent and signal\r\ndisaster at New Orleans, and the evaporation of their hopes from the\r\nHartford Convention, will probably raise a clamor in the British nation,\r\nwhich will force their ministry into peace. I say force them; because,\r\nwillingly, they would never be at peace. The British ministers find in\r\na state of war rather than of peace, by riding the various contractors,\r\nand receiving douceurs on the vast expenditures of the war supplies,\r\nthat they recruit their broken fortunes, or make new ones, and therefore\r\nwill not make peace, as long as by any delusions they can keep the\r\ntemper of the nation up to the war point. They found some hopes on\r\nthe state of our finances. It is true, that the excess of our banking\r\ninstitutions, and their present discredit, have shut us out from the\r\nbest source of credit we could ever command with certainty. But the\r\nfoundations of credit still remain to us, and need but skill, which\r\nexperience will soon produce, to marshal them into an order which may\r\ncarry us through any length of war. But they have hoped more in their\r\nHartford Convention. Their fears of republican France being now done\r\naway, they are directed to republican America, and they are playing the\r\nsame game for disorganization here, which they played in your country.\r\nThe Marats, the Dantons, and Robespierres of Massachusetts are in\r\nthe same pay, under the same orders, and making the same efforts to\r\nanarchize us, that their prototypes in France did there.\r\n\r\nI do not say that all who met at Hartford were under the same motives of\r\nmoney: nor were those of France. Some of them are Outs, and wish to\r\nbe Ins; some the mere dupes of the agitators, or of their own party\r\npassions; while the Maratists alone are in the real secret: but they\r\nhave very different materials to work on. The yeomanry of the United\r\nStates are not the canaille of Paris. We might safely give them leave to\r\ngo through the United States recruiting their ranks, and I am satisfied\r\nthey could not raise one single regiment (gambling merchants and\r\nsilk-stocking clerks excepted), who would support them in any effort to\r\nseparate from the Union. The cement of this Union is in the heart-blood\r\nof every American. I do not believe there is on earth a government\r\nestablished on so immovable a basis. Let them, in any State, even in\r\nMassachusetts itself, raise the standard of separation, and its citizens\r\nwill rise in mass, and do justice themselves on their own incendiaries.\r\nIf they could have induced the government to some effort of suppression,\r\nor even to enter into discussion with them, it would have given them\r\nsome importance, have brought them into some notice. But they have not\r\nbeen able to make themselves even a subject of conversation, either of\r\npublic or private societies. A silent contempt has been the sole notice\r\nthey could excite; consoled, indeed, some of them, by the palpable\r\nfavors of Philip. Have then no fears for us, my friend. The grounds\r\nof these exist only in English newspapers, endited or endowed by the\r\nCastlereaghs or the Cannings, or some other such models of pure and\r\nuncorrupted virtue. Their military heroes, by land and sea, may sink our\r\noyster-boats, rob our hen-roosts, burn our negro-huts, and run off. But\r\na campaign or two more will relieve them from further trouble or expense\r\nin defending their American possessions.\r\n\r\nYou once gave me a copy of the journal of your campaign in Virginia, in\r\n1781, which I must have lent to some one of the undertakers to write\r\nthe history of the revolutionary war, and forgot to reclaim. I conclude\r\nthis, because it is no longer among my papers, which I have very\r\ndiligently searched for it, but in vain. An author of real ability\r\nis now writing that part of the history of Virginia. He does it in my\r\nneighborhood, and I lay open to him all my papers. But I possess none,\r\nnor has he any, which can enable him to do justice to your faithful and\r\nable services in that campaign. If you could be so good as to send me\r\nanother copy, by the very first vessel bound to any port of the United\r\nStates, it might be here in time; for although he expects to begin\r\nto print within a month or two, yet you know the delays of these\r\nundertakings. At any rate, it might be got in as a supplement. The old\r\nCount Rochambeau gave me also his memoire of the operations at York,\r\nwhich is gone the same way, and I have no means of applying to his\r\nfamily for it. Perhaps you could render them as well as us, the service\r\nof procuring another copy.\r\n\r\nI learn, with real sorrow, the deaths of Monsieur and Madame de Tesse.\r\nThey made an interesting part in the idle reveries in which I have\r\nsometimes indulged myself, of seeing all my friends of Paris once\r\nmore, for a month or two; a thing impossible, which, however, I never\r\npermitted myself to despair of. The regrets, however, of seventy-three\r\nat the loss of friends, may be the less, as the time is shorter within\r\nwhich we are to meet again, according to the creed of our education.\r\n\r\nThis letter will be handed you by Mr. Ticknor, a young gentleman of\r\nBoston, of great erudition, indefatigable industry, and preparation for\r\na life of distinction, in his own country. He passed a few days with\r\nme here, brought high recommendations from Mr. Adams and others, and\r\nappeared in every respect to merit them. He is well worthy of those\r\nattentions which you so kindly bestow on our countrymen, and for those\r\nhe may receive I shall join him in acknowledging personal obligations.\r\n\r\nI salute you with assurances of my constant and affectionate friendship\r\nand respect.\r\n\r\nTh; Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. February 26. My letter had not yet been sealed, when I received\r\nnews of our peace. I am glad of it, and especially that we closed our\r\nwar with the eclat of the action at New Orleans. But I consider it as an\r\narmistice only, because no security is provided against the impressment\r\nof our seamen. While this is unsettled we are in hostility of mind with\r\nEngland, although actual deeds of arms may be suspended by a truce. If\r\nshe thinks the exercise of this outrage is worth eternal war, eternal\r\nwar it must be, or extermination of the one or the other party. The\r\nfirst act of impressment she commits on an American, will be answered\r\nby reprisal, or by a declaration of war here; and the interval must be\r\nmerely a state of preparation for it. In this we have much to do,\r\nin further fortifying our seaport towns, providing military stores,\r\nclassing and disciplining our militia, arranging our financial, system,\r\nand above all, pushing our domestic manufactures, which have taken such\r\nroot as never again can be shaken. Once more, God bless you. T.J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXII.*--TO MR. WENDOVER, March 13, 1815\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. WENDOVER.\r\n\r\nMonticello, March 13, 1815.\r\n\r\n     [* This is endorsed;’ not sent.’]\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of January the 30th was received after long delay on the\r\nroad, and I have to thank you for the volume of Discourses which you\r\nhave been so kind as to send me. I have gone over them with great\r\nsatisfaction, and concur with the able preacher in his estimate of\r\nthe character of the belligerents in our late war, and lawfulness of\r\ndefensive war. I consider the war, with him, as ‘made on good advice,’\r\nthat is, for just causes, and its dispensation as providential,\r\ninasmuch, as it has exercised our patriotism and submission to order,\r\nhas planted and invigorated among us arts of urgent necessity, has\r\nmanifested the strong and the weak parts of our republican institutions,\r\nand the excellence of a representative democracy compared with the\r\nmisrule of Kings, has rallied the opinions of mankind to the natural\r\nrights of expatriation, and of a common property in the ocean, and\r\nraised us to that grade in the scale of nations which the bravery and\r\nliberality of our citizen soldiers, by land and by sea, the wisdom of\r\nour institutions and their observance of justice, entitled us to in the\r\neyes of the world. All this Mr. McLeod has well proved, and from those\r\nsources of argument particularly which belong to his profession. On one\r\nquestion only I differ from him, and it is that which constitutes the\r\nsubject of his first discourse, the right of discussing public affairs\r\nin the pulpit. I add the last words, because I admit the right in\r\ngeneral conversation and in writing; in which last form it has been\r\nexercised in the valuable book you have now favored me with.\r\n\r\nThe mass of human concerns, moral and physical, is so vast, the field of\r\nknowledge requisite for man to conduct them to the best advantage is so\r\nextensive, that no human being can acquire the whole himself, and much\r\nless in that degree necessary for the instruction of others. It has of\r\nnecessity, then, been distributed into different departments, each\r\nof which, singly, may give occupation enough to the whole time and\r\nattention of a single individual. Thus we have teachers of Languages,\r\nteachers of Mathematics, of Natural Philosophy, of Chemistry, of\r\nMedicine, of Law, of History, of Government, &c. Religion, too, is a\r\nseparate department, and happens to be the only one deemed requisite\r\nfor all men, however high or low. Collections of men associate together,\r\nunder the name of congregations, and employ a religious teacher of the\r\nparticular sect of opinions of which they happen to be, and contribute\r\nto make up a stipend as a compensation for the trouble of delivering\r\nthem, at such periods as they agree on, lessons in the religion they\r\nprofess. If they want instruction in other sciences or arts, they apply\r\nto other instructers; and this is generally the business of early life.\r\nBut I suppose there is not an instance of a single congregation which\r\nhas employed their preacher for the mixt purpose of lecturing them\r\nfrom the pulpit, in Chemistry, in Medicine, in Law, in the science and\r\nprinciples of Government, or in any thing but Religion exclusively.\r\nWhenever, therefore, preachers, instead of a lesson in religion,\r\nput them off with a discourse on the Copernican system, on chemical\r\naffinities, on the construction of government, or the characters or\r\nconduct of those administering it, it is a breach of contract, depriving\r\ntheir audience of the kind of service for which they are salaried, and\r\ngiving them, instead it, what they did not want, or if wanted, would\r\nrather seek from better sources in that particular art or science. In\r\nchoosing our pastor we look to his religious qualifications, without\r\ninquiring into his physical or political dogmas, with which we mean to\r\nhave nothing to do. I am aware that arguments may be found, which may\r\ntwist a thread of politics into the cord of religious duties. So may\r\nthey for every other branch of human art or science. Thus, for example,\r\nit is a religious duty to obey the laws of our country: the teacher of\r\nreligion, therefore, must instruct us in those laws, that we may know\r\nhow to obey them. It is a religious duty to assist our sick neighbors:\r\nthe preacher must, therefore, teach us medicine, that we may do it\r\nunderstandingly. It is a religious duty to preserve our own health: our\r\nreligious teacher, then, must tell us what dishes are wholesome, and\r\ngive us recipes in cookery, that we may learn how to prepare them. And\r\nso ingenuity, by generalizing more and more, may amalgamate all the\r\nbranches of science into any one of them, and the physician who is\r\npaid to visit the sick, may give a sermon instead of medicine; and\r\nthe merchant to whom money is sent for a hat, may send a handkerchief\r\ninstead of it. But not withstanding this possible confusion of all\r\nsciences into one, common sense draws lines between them sufficiently\r\ndistinct for the general purposes of life, and no one is at a loss to\r\nunderstand that a recipe in medicine or cookery, or a demonstration in\r\ngeometry, is not a lesson in religion. I do not deny that a congregation\r\nmay, if they please, agree with their preacher that he shall instruct\r\nthem in Medicine also, or Law, or Politics. Then, lectures in these,\r\nfrom the pulpit, become not only a matter of right, but of duty also.\r\nBut this must be with the consent of every individual; because the\r\nassociation being voluntary, the mere majority has no right to apply the\r\ncontributions of the minority to purposes unspecified in the agreement\r\nof the congregation. I agree, too, that on all other occasions the\r\npreacher has the right, equally with every other citizen, to express his\r\nsentiments, in speaking or writing, on the subjects of Medicine, Law,\r\nPolitics, he, his leisure time being his own, and his congregation not\r\nobliged to listen to his conversation, or to read his writings; and no\r\none would have regretted more than myself, had any scruple as to this\r\nright, withheld from us the valuable discourses which have led to the\r\nexpression of an opinion as to the true limits of the right. I feel\r\nmy portion of indebtment to the reverend author, for the distinguished\r\nlearning, the logic, and the eloquence, with which he had proved that\r\nreligion, as well as reason, confirms the soundness of those principles\r\non which our government has been founded and its rights asserted.\r\n\r\nThese are my views of this question. They are in opposition to those\r\nof the highly respected and able preacher, and are therefore the more\r\ndoubtingly offered. Difference of opinion leads to inquiry, and inquiry\r\nto truth; and that, I am sure, is the ultimate and sincere object of us\r\nboth. We both value too much the freedom of opinion sanctioned by our\r\nconstitution, not to cherish its exercise even where in opposition to\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nUnaccustomed to reserve or mystery in the expression of my opinions, I\r\nhave opened myself frankly on a question suggested by your letter and\r\npresent. And although I have not the honor of your acquaintance, this\r\nmark of attention, and still more the sentiments of esteem so kindly\r\nexpressed in your letter, are entitled to a confidence that observations\r\nnot intended for the public will not be ushered to their notice, as has\r\nhappened to me sometimes. Tranquillity, at my age, is the balm of life.\r\nWhile I know I am safe in the honor and charity of a McLeod, I do not\r\nwish to be cast forth to the Marats, the Dantons, and the Robespierres\r\nof the priesthood: I mean the Parishes, the Osgoods, and the Gardiners\r\nof Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nI pray you to accept the assurances of my esteem and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXIII.--TO CÆSAR A. RODNEY, March 16, 1815\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CÆSAR A. RODNEY.\r\n\r\nMonticello, March 16, 1815.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Friend and Ancient Colleague,\r\n\r\nYour letter of February the 19th has been received with very sincere\r\npleasure. It recalls to memory the sociability, the friendship, and the\r\nharmony of action which united personal happiness with public duties,\r\nduring the portion of our lives in which we acted together. Indeed,\r\nthe affectionate harmony of our cabinet is among the sweetest of my\r\nrecollections. I have just received a letter of friendship from General\r\nDearborn. He writes me that he is now retiring from every species of\r\npublic occupation, to pass the remainder of life as a private citizen;\r\nand he promises me a visit in the course of the summer. As you hold out\r\na hope of the same gratification, if chance or purpose could time your\r\nvisits together, it would make a real jubilee. But come as you will, or\r\nas you can, it will always be joy enough to me. Only you must give me a\r\nmonth’s notice; because I go three or four times a year to a possession\r\nninety miles southwestward, and am absent a month at a time, and the\r\nmortification would be indelible of losing such a visit by a mistimed\r\nabsence. You will find me in habitual good health, great contentedness,\r\nenfeebled in body, impaired in memory, but without decay in my\r\nfriendships.\r\n\r\nGreat, indeed, have been the revolutions in the world, since you and I\r\nhave had any thing to do with it. To me they have been like the howlings\r\nof the winter storm over the battlements, while warm in my bed. The\r\nunprincipled tyrant of the land is fallen, his power reduced to its\r\noriginal nothingness, his person only not yet in the mad-house, where\r\nit ought always to have been. His equally unprincipled competitor, the\r\ntyrant of the ocean, in the mad-house indeed, in person, but his\r\npower still stalking over the deep. ‘_Quem deus vult perdere, prius\r\ndementat_.’ The madness is acknowledged; the perdition of course\r\nimpending. Are we to be the instruments? A friendly, a just, and a\r\nreasonable conduct on their part, might make us the main pillar of their\r\nprosperity and existence. But their deep-rooted hatred to us seems to\r\nbe the means which Providence permits to lead them to their final\r\ncatastrophe. ‘_Nullam enim in terris gentem esse, nullum infestiorem\r\npopulum, nomini Romano_, said the General who erased Capua from the list\r\nof powers. What nourishment and support would not England receive from\r\nan hundred millions of industrious descendants, whom some of her people\r\nnow born will live to see here. What their energies are, she has lately\r\ntried. And what has she not to fear from an hundred millions of such\r\nmen, if she continues her maniac course of hatred and hostility to them.\r\nI hope in God she will change. There is not a nation on the globe\r\nwith whom I have more earnestly wished a friendly intercourse on equal\r\nconditions. On no other would I hold out the hand of friendship to\r\nany. I know that their creatures represent me as personally an enemy to\r\nEngland. But fools only can believe this, or those who think me a\r\nfool. I am an enemy to her insults and injuries. I am an enemy to the\r\nflagitious principles of her administration, and to those which govern\r\nher conduct towards other nations. But would she give to morality some\r\nplace in her political code, and especially would she exercise decency,\r\nand at least neutral passions towards us, there is not, I repeat it, a\r\npeople on earth with whom I would sacrifice so much to be in friendship.\r\nThey can do us, as enemies, more harm than any other nation; and in\r\npeace and in war, they have more means of disturbing us internally.\r\nTheir merchants established among us, the bonds by which our own are\r\nchained to their feet, and the banking combinations interwoven with the\r\nwhole, have shown the extent of their control, even during a war with\r\nher. They are the workers of all the embarrassments our finances have\r\nexperienced during the war. Declaring themselves bankrupt, they have\r\nbeen able still to chain the government to a dependence on them; and\r\nhad the war continued, they would have reduced us to the inability to\r\ncommand a single dollar. They dared to proclaim that they would not pay\r\ntheir own paper obligations, yet our government could not venture to\r\navail themselves of this opportunity of sweeping their paper from the\r\ncirculation, and substituting their own notes bottomed on specific taxes\r\nfor redemption, which every one would have eagerly taken and trusted,\r\nrather than the baseless trash of bankrupt companies; our government,\r\nI say, have still been overawed from a contest with them, and have\r\neven countenanced and strengthened their influence, by proposing new\r\nestablishments, with authority to swindle yet greater sums from our\r\ncitizens. This is the British influence to which I am an enemy, and\r\nwhich we must subject to our government, or it will subject us to that\r\nof Britain.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nCome and gratify, by seeing you once more, a friend, who assures you\r\nwith sincerity of his constant and affectionate attachment and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXIV.--TO GENERAL DEARBORN, March 17, 1815\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL DEARBORN.\r\n\r\nMonticello, March 17, 1815.\r\n\r\nMy Dear General, Friend, and Ancient Colleague,\r\n\r\nI have received your favor of February the 27th, with very great\r\npleasure, and sincerely reciprocate congratulations on the late events.\r\nPeace was indeed desirable; yet it would not have been as welcome\r\nwithout the successes of New Orleans. These last have established\r\ntruths too important not to be valued; that the people of Louisiana are\r\nsincerely attached to the Union; that their city can be defended; that\r\nthe western States make its defence their peculiar concern; that the\r\nmilitia are brave; that their deadly aim countervails the manoeuvring\r\nskill of their enemy; that we have officers of natural genius now\r\nstarting forward from the mass; and that, putting together all our\r\nconflicts, we can beat the British, by sea and by land, with equal\r\nnumbers. All this being now proved, I am glad of the pacification of\r\nGhent, and shall still be more so, if, by a reasonable arrangement\r\nagainst impressment, they will make it truly a treaty of peace, and not\r\na mere truce, as we must all consider it, until the principle of the\r\nwar is settled. Nor, among the incidents of the war, will we forget your\r\nservices. After the disasters produced by the treason or the cowardice,\r\nor both, of Hull, and the follies of some others, your capture of York\r\nand Fort George first turned the tide of success in our favor; and the\r\nsubsequent campaigns sufficiently wiped away the disgraces of the\r\nfirst. If it were justifiable to look to your own happiness only, your\r\nresolution to retire from all public business could not but be approved.\r\nBut you are too young to ask a discharge as yet, and the public counsels\r\ntoo much needing the wisdom of our ablest citizens, to relinquish their\r\nclaim on you. And surely none needs your aid more than your own State.\r\nOh, Massachusetts! how have I lamented the degradation of your apostacy!\r\nMassachusetts, with whom I went with pride in 1776, whose vote was\r\nmy vote on every public question, and whose principles were then the\r\nstandard of whatever was free or fearless. But then she was under the\r\ncounsels of the two Adamses; while Strong, her present leader, was\r\npromoting petitions for submission to British power and British\r\nusurpation. While under her present counsels, she must be contented to\r\nbe nothing; as having a vote, indeed, to be counted, but not respected.\r\nBut should the State once more buckle on her republican harness, we\r\nshall receive her again as a sister, and recollect her wanderings among\r\nthe crimes only of the parricide party, which would have basely sold\r\nwhat their fathers so bravely won from the same enemy. Let us look\r\nforward, then, to the act of repentance, which, by dismissing her\r\nvenal traitors, shall be the signal of return to the bosom and to the\r\nprinciples of her brethren; and if her late humiliation can just give\r\nher modesty enough to suppose that her southern brethren are somewhat on\r\na par with her in wisdom, in information, in patriotism, in bravery,\r\nand even in honesty, although not in psalm-singing, she will more\r\njustly estimate her own relative momentum in the Union. With her ancient\r\nprinciples, she would really be great, if she did not think herself the\r\nwhole. I should be pleased to hear that you go into her councils,\r\nand assist in bringing her back to those principles, and to a sober\r\nsatisfaction with her proportionable share in the direction of our\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nBe so good as to lay my homage at the feet of Mrs. Dearborn, and to be\r\nassured that I am ever and affectionately yours.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXV.--TO THE PRESIDENT, March 23,1815\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nMonticello, March 23,1815.\r\n\r\nDeak Sir,\r\n\r\nI duly received your favor of the 12th, and with it the pamphlet on the\r\ncauses and conduct of the war, which I now return. I have read it\r\nwith great pleasure, but with irresistible desire that it should be\r\npublished. The reasons in favor of this are strong, and those against it\r\nare so easily gotten over, that there appears to me no balance between\r\nthem. 1. We need it in Europe. They have totally mistaken our character.\r\nAccustomed to rise at a feather themselves, and to be always fighting,\r\nthey will see in our conduct, fairly stated, that acquiescence under\r\nwrong, to a certain degree, is wisdom, and not pusillanimity; and\r\nthat peace and happiness are preferable to that false honor, which,\r\nby eternal wars, keeps their people in eternal labor, want, and\r\nwretchedness. 2. It is necessary for the people of England, who have\r\nbeen deceived as to the causes and conduct of the war, and do not\r\nentertain a doubt, that it was entirely wanton and wicked on our part,\r\nand under the order of Bonaparte. By rectifying their ideas, it will\r\ntend to that conciliation which is absolutely necessary to the peace and\r\nprosperity of both nations. 3. It is necessary for our own people, who,\r\nalthough they have known the details as they went along, yet have been\r\nso plied with false facts and false views by; the federalists, that some\r\nimpression has been left that all has not been right. It may be said\r\nthat it will be thought unfriendly. But truths necessary for our own\r\ncharacter, must not be suppressed out of tenderness to its calumniators.\r\nAlthough written, generally, with great moderation, there may be some\r\nthings in the pamphlet which may perhaps irritate. The characterizing\r\nevery act, for example, by its appropriate epithet, is not necessary to\r\nshow its deformity to an intelligent reader. The naked narrative\r\nwill present it truly to his mind, and the more strongly, from its\r\nmoderation, as he will perceive that no exaggeration is aimed\r\nat. Rubbing down these roughnesses (and they are neither many nor\r\nprominent), and preserving the original date, might, I think, remove all\r\nthe offensiveness, and give more effect to the publication. Indeed,\r\nI think that a soothing postscript, addressed to the interests,\r\nthe prospects, and the sober reason of both nations, would make it\r\nacceptable to both. The trifling, expense of reprinting it ought not\r\nto be considered a moment. Mr. Gallatin could have it translated into\r\nFrench, and suffer it to get abroad in Europe without either avowal or\r\ndisavowal. But it would be useful to print some copies of an appendix,\r\ncontaining all the documents referred to, to be preserved in libraries,\r\nand to facilitate to the present and future writers of history, the\r\nacquisition of the materials which test the truths it contains.\r\n\r\nI sincerely congratulate you on the peace, and more especially on the\r\neclat with which the war was closed. The affair of New Orleans was\r\nfraught with useful lessons to ourselves, our enemies, and our friends,\r\nand will powerfully influence our future relations with the nations of\r\nEurope. It will show them we mean to take no part in their wars, and\r\ncount no odds when engaged in our own. I presume, that, having spared\r\nto the pride of England her formal acknowledgment of the atrocity of\r\nimpressment in an article of the treaty, she will concur in a convention\r\nfor relinquishing it. Without this, she must understand that the present\r\nis but a truce, determinable on the first act of impressment of an\r\nAmerican citizen, committed by any officer of hers. Would it not be\r\nbetter that this convention should be a separate act, unconnected with\r\nany treaty of commerce, and made an indispensable preliminary to all\r\nother treaty? If blended with a treaty of commerce, she will make it the\r\nprice of injurious concessions. Indeed, we are infinitely better without\r\nsuch treaties with any nation. We cannot too distinctly detach ourselves\r\nfrom the European system, which is essentially belligerent, nor too\r\nsedulously cultivate an American system, essentially pacific. But if we\r\ngo into commercial treaties at all, they should be with all, at the same\r\ntime, with whom we have important commercial relations. France, Spain,\r\nPortugal, Holland, Denmark, Sweden, Russia, all should proceed _pari\r\npassu_. Our ministers marching in phalanx on the same line, and\r\nintercommunicating freely, each will be supported by the weight of the\r\nwhole mass, and the facility with which the other nations will agree to\r\nequal terms of intercourse, will discountenance the selfish higglings of\r\nEngland, or justify our rejection of them. Perhaps with all of them\r\nit would be best to have but the single article _gentis amicissimæ_,\r\nleaving every thing else to the usages and courtesies of civilized\r\nnations. But all these things will occur to yourself, with their counter\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith wrote to me on the transportation of the library, and\r\nparticularly, that it is submitted to your direction. He mentioned also,\r\nthat Dougherty would be engaged to superintend it. No one will more\r\ncarefully and faithfully execute all those duties which would belong to\r\na wagon-master. But it requires a character acquainted with books, to\r\nreceive the library. I am now employing as many hours of every day as my\r\nstrength will permit, in arranging the books, and putting every one in\r\nits place on the shelves, corresponding with its order in the catalogue,\r\nand shall have them numbered correspondently. This operation will employ\r\nme a considerable time yet. Then I should wish a competent agent to\r\nattend, and, with the catalogue in his hand, see that every book is on\r\nthe shelves, and have their lids nailed on, one by one, as he proceeds.\r\nThis would take such a person about two days; after which, Dougherty’s\r\nbusiness would be the mere mechanical removal, at convenience. I enclose\r\nyou a letter from Mr. Milligan, offering his service, which would not\r\ncost more than eight or ten days’ reasonable compensation. This is\r\nnecessary for my safety, and your satisfaction, as a just caution for\r\nthe public. You know there are persons, both in and out of the public\r\ncouncils, who will seize every occasion of imputation on either of us,\r\nthe more difficult to be repelled in this case, in which a negative\r\ncould not be proved. If you approve of it, therefore, as soon as I am\r\nthrough the review, I will give notice to Mr. Milligan, or any other\r\nperson whom you will name, to come on immediately. Indeed it would be\r\nwell worth while to add to his duty, that of covering the books with a\r\nlittle paper (the good bindings at least), and filling the vacancies\r\nof the presses with paper-parings, to be brought from Washington. This\r\nwould add little more to the time, as he could carry on both operations\r\nat once.\r\n\r\nAccept the assurance of my constant and affectionate friendship and\r\nrespect,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXVI.--TO JOHN ADAMS, June 10,1815\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nMonticello, June 10,1815.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nIt is long since we have exchanged a letter, and yet what volumes might\r\nhave been written on the occurrences even of the last three months. In\r\nthe first place, peace, God bless it! has returned, to put us all\r\nagain into a course of lawful and laudable pursuits: a new trial of the\r\nBourbons has proved to the world their incompetence to the functions\r\nof the station they have occupied: and the recall of the usurper has\r\nclothed him with the semblance of a legitimate autocrat. If adversity\r\nshould have taught him wisdom, of which I have little expectation,\r\nhe may yet render some service to mankind, by teaching the ancient\r\ndynasties that they can be changed for misrule, and by wearing down the\r\nmaritime power of England to limitable and safe dimensions. But it is\r\nnot possible he should love us; and of that our commerce had sufficient\r\nproofs during his power. Our military achievements, indeed, which he\r\nis capable of estimating, may in some degree moderate the effect of his\r\naversions; and he may perhaps fancy that we are to become the natural\r\nenemies of England, as England herself has so steadily endeavored to\r\nmake us, and as some of our own over-zealous patriots would be willing\r\nto proclaim; and in this view, he may admit a cold toleration of some\r\nintercourse and commerce between the two nations. He has certainly\r\nhad time to see the folly of turning the industry of France from the\r\ncultures for which nature has so highly endowed her, to those of sugar,\r\ncotton, tobacco, and others, which the same creative power has given to\r\nother climates: and, on the whole, if he can conquer the passions of his\r\ntyrannical soul, if he has understanding enough to pursue from motives\r\nof interest, what no moral motives lead him to, the tranquil happiness\r\nand prosperity of his country, rather than a ravenous thirst for human\r\nblood, his return may become of more advantage than injury to us. And if\r\nagain some great man could arise in England, who could see and correct\r\nthe follies of his nation in their conduct as to us, and by exercising\r\njustice and comity towards ours, bring both into a state of temperate\r\nand useful friendship, it is possible we might thus attain the place we\r\nought to occupy between these two nations, without being degraded to the\r\ncondition of mere partisans of either.\r\n\r\nA little time will now inform us, whether France, within its proper\r\nlimits, is big enough for its ruler, on the one hand, and whether, on\r\nthe other, the allied powers are either wicked or foolish enough to\r\nattempt the forcing on the French, a ruler and government which they\r\nrefuse; whether they will risk their own thrones to re-establish that\r\nof the Bourbons. If this is attempted, and the European world again\r\ncommitted to war, will the jealousy of England at the commerce which\r\nneutrality will give us, induce her again to add us to the number of\r\nher enemies, rather than see us prosper in the pursuit of peace and\r\nindustry? And have our commercial citizens merited from their country\r\nits encountering another war to protect their gambling enterprises?\r\nThat the persons of our citizens shall be safe in freely traversing the\r\nocean, that the transportation of our own produce, in our own vessels,\r\nto the markets of our choice, and the return to us of the articles we\r\nwant for our own use, shall be unmolested, I hold to be fundamental, and\r\nthat the gauntlet must be for ever hurled at him who questions it. But\r\nwhether we shall engage in every war of Europe, to protect the mere\r\nagency of our merchants and shipowners in carrying on the commerce of\r\nother nations, even were those merchants and ship-owners to take the\r\nside of their country in the contest, instead of that of the enemy, is a\r\nquestion of deep and serious consideration, with which, however, you and\r\nI shall have nothing to do; so we will leave it to those whom it will\r\nconcern.\r\n\r\nI thank you for making known to me Mr. Ticknor and Mr. Gray. They are\r\nfine young men, indeed, and if Massachusetts can raise a few more such,\r\nit is probable she would be better counselled as to social rights and\r\nsocial duties. Mr. Ticknor is, particularly, the best bibliograph I\r\nhave met with, and very kindly and opportunely offered me the means of\r\nreprocuring some part of the literary treasures which I have ceded\r\nto Congress, to replace the devastations of British Vandalism at\r\nWashington. I cannot live without books. But fewer will suffice, where\r\namusement, and not use, is the only future object. I am about sending\r\nhim a catalogue, to which less than his critical knowledge of books\r\nwould hardly be adequate.\r\n\r\nPresent my high respects to Mrs. Adams, and accept yourself the\r\nassurances of my affectionate attachment.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXVII.--TO MR. LEIPER, June 12, 1815\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. LEIPER.\r\n\r\nMonticello, June 12, 1815.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nA journey soon after the receipt of your favor of April the 17th and\r\nan absence from home of some continuance, have prevented my earlier\r\nacknowledgment of it. In that came safely my letter of January the 2nd,\r\n1814. In our principles of government we differ not at all; nor in the\r\ngeneral object and tenor of political measures. We concur in considering\r\nthe government of England as totally without morality, insolent beyond\r\nbearing, inflated with vanity and ambition, aiming at the exclusive\r\ndominion of the sea, lost in corruption, of deep-rooted hatred towards\r\nus, hostile to liberty wherever it endeavors to show its head, and\r\nthe eternal disturber of the peace of the world. In our estimate of\r\nBonaparte, I suspect we differ. I view him as a political engine only,\r\nand a very wicked one; you, I believe, as both political and religious,\r\nand obeying, as an instrument, an unseen hand. I still deprecate his\r\nbecoming sole lord of the continent of Europe, which he would have been,\r\nhad he reached in triumph the gates of Petersburg. The establishment in\r\nour day of another Roman. empire, spreading vassalage and depravity over\r\nthe face of the globe, is not, I hope, within the purposes of Heaven.\r\nNor does the return of Bonaparte give me pleasure unmixed; I see in his\r\nexpulsion of the Bourbons, a valuable lesson to the world, as showing\r\nthat its ancient dynasties may be changed for their misrule. Should the\r\nallied powers presume to dictate a ruler and government to France, and\r\nfollow the example he had set of parcelling and usurping to themselves\r\ntheir neighbor nations, I hope he will give them another lesson in\r\nvindication of the rights of independence and self-government, which\r\nhimself had heretofore so much abused, and that in this contest he\r\nwill wear down the maritime power of England to limitable and safe\r\ndimensions. So far, good. It cannot be denied, on the other hand, that\r\nhis successful perversion of the force (committed to him for vindicating\r\nthe rights and liberties of his country) to usurp its government, and\r\nto enchain it under an hereditary despotism, is of baneful effect in\r\nencouraging future usurpations, and deterring those under oppression\r\nfrom rising to redress themselves. His restless spirit leaves no hope of\r\npeace to the world; and his hatred of us is only a little less than that\r\nhe bears to England, and England to us. Our form of government is odious\r\nto him, as a standing contrast between republican and despotic rule; and\r\nas much from that hatred, as from ignorance in political economy, he had\r\nexcluded intercourse between us and his people, by prohibiting the only\r\narticles they wanted from us, that is, cotton and tobacco. Whether the\r\nwar we have had with England, the achievements of that war, and the hope\r\nthat we may become his instruments and partisans against that enemy, may\r\ninduce him, in future, to tolerate our commercial intercourse with his\r\npeople, is still to be seen. For my part, I wish that all nations may\r\nrecover and retain their independence; that those which are overgrown\r\nmay not advance beyond safe measures of power, that a salutary balance\r\nmay be ever maintained among nations, and that our peace, commerce, and\r\nfriendship may be sought and cultivated by all. It is our business to\r\nmanufacture for ourselves whatever we can, to keep all markets open for\r\nwhat we can spare or want; and the less we have to do with the amities\r\nor enmities of Europe, the better. Not in our day, but at no distant\r\none, we may shake a rod over the heads of all, which may make the\r\nstoutest of them tremble. But I hope our wisdom will grow with our\r\npower, and teach us that the less we use our power, the greater it will\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nThe federal misrepresentation of my sentiments, which occasioned my\r\nformer letter to you, was gross enough; but that and all others are\r\nexceeded by the impudence and falsehood of the printed extract you sent\r\nme from Ralph’s paper. That a continuance of the embargo for two months\r\nlonger would have prevented our war; that the non-importation law\r\nwhich succeeded it was a wise and powerful measure, I have constantly\r\nmaintained. My friendship for Mr. Madison, my confidence in his wisdom\r\nand virtue, and my approbation of all his measures, and especially of\r\nhis taking up at length the gauntlet against England, is known to all\r\nwith whom I have ever conversed or corresponded on these measures. The\r\nword federal, or its synonyme &c., may therefore be written under every\r\nword of Mr. Ralph’s paragraph. I have ransacked my memory to recollect\r\nany incident which might have given countenance to any particle of it,\r\nbut I find none. For if you will except the bringing into power\r\nand importance those who were enemies to himself as well as to the\r\nprinciples of republican government, I do not recollect a single measure\r\nof the President which I have not approved. Of those under him, and\r\nof some very near him, there have been many acts of which we have all\r\ndisapproved, and he more than we. We have at times dissented from the\r\nmeasures, and lamented the dilatoriness of Congress. I recollect an\r\ninstance the first winter of the war, when, from sloth of proceedings,\r\nan embargo was permitted to run through the winter, while the enemy\r\ncould not cruise, nor consequently restrain the exportation of our whole\r\nproduce, and was taken off in the spring, as soon as they could resume\r\ntheir stations. But this procrastination is unavoidable. How can\r\nexpedition be expected from a body which we have saddled with an hundred\r\nlawyers, whose trade is talking? But lies, to sow divisions among\r\nus, are so stale an artifice of the federal prints, and are so well\r\nunderstood, that they need neither contradiction nor explanation. As to\r\nmyself, my confidence in the wisdom and integrity of the administration\r\nis so entire, that I scarcely notice what is passing, and have almost\r\nceased to read newspapers. Mine remain in our post-office a week or ten\r\ndays, sometimes, unasked for. I find more amusement in studies to which\r\nI was always more attached, and from which I was dragged by the events\r\nof the times in which I have happened to live.\r\n\r\nI rejoice exceedingly that our war with England was single-handed. In\r\nthat of the Revolution, we had France, Spain, and Holland on our side,\r\nand the credit of its success was given to them. On the late occasion,\r\nunprepared and unexpecting war, we were compelled to declare it, and to\r\nreceive the attack of England, just issuing from a general war, fully\r\narmed, and freed from all other enemies, and have not only made her\r\nsick of it, but glad to prevent, by a peace, the capture of her adjacent\r\npossessions, which one or two campaigns more would infallibly have made\r\nours. She has found that we can do her more injury than any other enemy\r\non earth, and henceforward will better estimate the value of our peace.\r\nBut whether her government has power, in opposition to the aristocracy\r\nof her navy, to restrain their piracies within the limits of national\r\nrights, may well be doubted. I pray, therefore, for peace, as best for\r\nall the world, best for us, and best for me, who have already lived to\r\nsee three wars, and now pant for nothing more than to be permitted to\r\ndepart in peace. That you also, who have longer to live, may continue to\r\nenjoy this blessing with health and prosperity, through as long a life\r\nas you desire, is the prayer of yours affectionately.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\nP. S. June the 14th. Before I had sent my letter to the post-office, I\r\nreceived the new treaty of the allied powers, declaring that the French\r\nnation shall not have Bonaparte, and shall have Louis XVIII for their\r\nruler. They are all then as great rascals, as Bonaparte himself. While\r\nhe was in the wrong, I wished him exactly as much success as would\r\nanswer our purposes, and no more. Now that they are wrong and he in\r\nthe right, he shall have all my prayers for success, and that he may\r\ndethrone every man of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXVIII.--TO JOHN ADAMS, August 10,1815\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nMonticello, August 10,1815.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nThe simultaneous movements in our correspondence have been remarkable on\r\nseveral occasions. It would seem as if the state of the air, or state of\r\nthe times, or some other unknown cause, produced a sympathetic effect on\r\nour mutual recollections. I had sat down to answer your letters of June\r\nthe 19th, 20th, and 22nds with pen, ink, and paper, before me, when I\r\nreceived from our mail that of July the 30th. You ask information on\r\nthe subject of Camus. All I recollect of him is, that he was one of the\r\ndeputies sent to arrest Dumourier at the head of his army, who were,\r\nhowever, themselves arrested by Dumourier, and long detained as\r\nprisoners. I presume, therefore, he was a Jacobin. You will find his\r\ncharacter in the most excellent revolutionary history of Toulongeon. I\r\nbelieve also, he may be the same person who has given us a translation\r\nof Aristotle’s Natural History, from the Greek into French. Of his\r\nreport to the National Institute on the subject of the Bollandists, your\r\nletter gives me the first information. I had supposed them defunct\r\nwith the society of Jesuits, of which they were: and that their works,\r\nalthough above ground, were, from their bulk and insignificance, as\r\neffectually entombed on their shelves, as if in the graves of their\r\nauthors. Fifty-two volumes in folio, of the _acta sanctorum_, in\r\ndog-Latin, would be a formidable enterprise to the most laborious\r\nGerman. I expect, with you, they are the most enormous mass of lies,\r\nfrauds, hypocrisy, and imposture, that ever was heaped together on this\r\nglobe. By what chemical process M. Camus supposed that an extract of\r\ntruth could be obtained from such a farrago of falsehood, I must leave\r\nto the chemists and moralists of the age to divine.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of the history of the American Revolution you ask who\r\nshall write it? Who can write it? And who will ever be able to write it?\r\nNobody; except merely its external facts; all its councils, designs, and\r\ndiscussions having been conducted by Congress with closed doors, and no\r\nmember, as far as I know, having even made notes of them. These, which\r\nare the life and soul of history, must for ever be unknown. Botta, as\r\nyou observe, has put his own speculations and reasonings into the mouths\r\nof persons whom he names, but who, you and I know, never made such\r\nspeeches. In this he has followed the example of the ancients, who made\r\ntheir great men deliver long speeches, all of them in the same style,\r\nand in that of the author himself. The work is nevertheless a good one,\r\nmore judicious, more chaste, more classical, and more true, than the\r\nparty diatribe of Marshall. Its greatest fault is in having taken too\r\nmuch from him. I possessed the work, and often recurred to considerable\r\nportions of it, although I never read it through. But a very judicious\r\nand well informed neighbor of mine went through it with great attention,\r\nand spoke very highly of it. I have said that no member of the old\r\nCongress, as far as I knew, made notes of the discussions. I did not\r\nknew of the speeches you mention of Dickinson and Witherspoon But on\r\nthe questions of Independence, and on the two articles of Confederation\r\nrespecting taxes and voting, I took minutes of the heads of the\r\narguments. On the first, I threw all into one mass, without ascribing\r\nto the speakers their respective arguments; pretty much in the manner of\r\nHume’s summary digests of the reasonings in parliament for and against\r\na measure. On the last, I stated the heads of arguments used by each\r\nspeaker. But the whole of my notes on the question of Independence does\r\nnot occupy more than five pages, such as of this letter: and on the\r\nother questions, two such sheets. They have never been communicated to\r\nany one. Do you know that there exists in manuscript the ablest work\r\nof this kind ever yet executed, of the debates of the constitutional\r\nconvention of Philadelphia in 1788? The whole of every thing said and\r\ndone there was taken down by Mr. Madison, with a labor and exactness\r\nbeyond comprehension.\r\n\r\nI presume that our correspondence has been observed at the post-offices,\r\nand thus has attracted notice. Would you believe, that a printer has had\r\nthe effrontery to propose to me the letting him publish it? These people\r\nthink they have a right to every thing, however secret or sacred. I had\r\nnot before heard of the Boston pamphlet with Priestley’s Letters and\r\nmine.\r\n\r\nAt length Bonaparte has got on the right side of a question. From the\r\ntime of his entering the legislative hall to his retreat to Elba, no man\r\nhas execrated him more than myself. I will not except even the members\r\nof the Essex Junto; although for very different reasons; I, because he\r\nwas warring against the liberty of his own country, and independence\r\nof others; they, because he was the enemy of England, the Pope, and the\r\nInquisition. But at length, and as far as we can judge, he seems to have\r\nbecome the choice of his nation. At least, he is defending the cause\r\nof his nation, and that of all mankind, the rights of every people to\r\nindependence and self-government. He and the allies have now changed\r\nsides. They are parcelling out among themselves Poland, Belgium, Saxony,\r\nItaly, dictating a ruler and government to France, and looking askance\r\nat our republic, the splendid libel on their governments, and he is\r\nfighting for the principles of national independence, of which his whole\r\nlife hitherto has been a continued violation. He has promised a free\r\ngovernment to his own country, and to respect the rights of others; and\r\nalthough his former conduct inspires little confidence in his promises,\r\nyet we had better take the chance of his word for doing right, than the\r\ncertainty of the wrong which his adversaries are doing and avowing. If\r\nthey succeed, ours is only the boon of the Cyclops to Ulysses, of being\r\nthe last devoured.\r\n\r\nPresent me affectionately and respectfully to Mrs. Adams, and Heaven\r\ngive you both as much more of life as you wish, and bless it with health\r\nand happiness.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\nP. S. August the 11th. I had finished my letter yesterday, and this\r\nmorning receive the news of Bonaparte’s second abdication. Very\r\nwell. For him personally, I have no feeling but reprobation. The\r\nrepresentatives of the nation have deposed him. They have taken the\r\nallies at their word, that they had no object in the war but his\r\nremoval. The nation is now free to give itself a good government, either\r\nwith or without a Bourbon; and France unsubdued, will still be a bridle\r\non the enterprises of the combined powers, and a bulwark to others. T.J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXIX.--TO DABNEY CARR, January 19, 1816\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DABNEY CARR.\r\n\r\nMonticello, January 19, 1816.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nAt the date of your letter of December the 1st, I was in Bedford, and\r\nsince my return, so many letters, accumulated during my absence, having\r\nbeen pressing for answers, that this is the first moment I have been\r\nable to attend to the subject of yours. While Mr. Girardin was in\r\nthis neighborhood writing his continuation of Burke’s History, I had\r\nsuggested to him a proper notice of the establishment of the committee\r\nof correspondence here in 1773, and of Mr. Carr, your father, who\r\nintroduced it. He has doubtless done this, and his work is now in the\r\npress. My books, journals of the times, &c. being all gone, I have\r\nnothing now but an impaired memory to resort to for the more particular\r\nstatement you wish. But I give it with the more confidence, as I find\r\nthat I remember old things better than new. The transaction took place\r\nin the session of Assembly of March 1773. Patrick Henry, Richard Henry\r\nLee, Frank Lee, your father, and myself, met by agreement, one evening,\r\nabout the close of the session, at the Raleigh Tavern, to consult on\r\nthe measures which the circumstances of the times seemed to call for.\r\nWe agreed, in result, that concert in the operations of the several\r\nColonies was indispensable; and that to produce this, some channel of\r\ncorrespondence between them must be opened: that, therefore, we would\r\npropose to our House the appointment of a committee of correspondence,\r\nwhich should be authorized and instructed to write to the Speakers of\r\nthe House of Representatives of the several Colonies, recommending the\r\nappointment of similar committees on their part, who, by a communication\r\nof sentiment on the transactions threatening us all, might promote\r\na harmony of action salutary to all. This was the substance, not\r\npretending to remember words. We proposed the resolution, and your\r\nfather was agreed on to make the motion. He did it the next day, March\r\nthe 12th, with great ability, reconciling all to it, not only by\r\nthe reasonings, but by the temper and moderation with which it was\r\ndeveloped. It was adopted by a very general vote. Peyton Randolph, some\r\nof us who proposed it, and who else I do not remember, were appointed\r\nof the committee. We immediately despatched letters by expresses, to\r\nthe Speakers of all the other Assemblies. I remember that Mr. Carr and\r\nmyself, returning home together, and conversing on the subject by the\r\nway, concurred in the conclusion, that that measure must inevitably\r\nbeget the meeting of a Congress of Deputies from all the Colonies, for\r\nthe purpose of uniting all in the same principles and measures for the\r\nmaintenance of our rights. My memory cannot deceive me, when I affirm\r\nthat we did it in consequence of no such proposition from any other\r\nColony. No doubt, the resolution itself, and the journals of the day,\r\nwill show that ours was original, and not merely responsive to one from\r\nany other quarter. Yet, I am certain I remember also, that a similar\r\nproposition, and nearly cotemporary, was made by Massachusetts, and\r\nthat our northern messenger passed theirs on the road. This, too, may be\r\nsettled by recurrence to the records of Massachusetts. The proposition\r\nwas generally acceded to by the other Colonies, and the first effect,\r\nas expected, was the meeting of a Congress at New York the ensuing year.\r\nThe committee of correspondence appointed by Massachusetts, as quoted by\r\nyou from Marshall, under the date of 1770, must have been for a special\r\npurpose, and _functus officio_ before the date of 1773, or Massachusetts\r\nherself would not then have proposed another. Records should be examined\r\nto settle this accurately. I well remember the pleasure expressed in the\r\ncountenance and conversation of the members generally, on this _début_\r\nof Mr. Carr, and the hopes they conceived as well from the talents as\r\nthe patriotism it manifested. But he died within two months after, and\r\nin him we lost a powerful fellow-laborer. His character was of a high\r\norder. A spotless integrity, sound judgment, handsome imagination,\r\nenriched by education and reading, quick and clear in his conceptions,\r\nof correct and ready elocution, impressing every hearer with the\r\nsincerity of the heart from which it flowed. His firmness was inflexible\r\nin whatever he thought was right: but when no moral principle stood\r\nin the way, never had man more of the milk of human kindness, of\r\nindulgence, of softness, of pleasantry in conversation and conduct. The\r\nnumber of his friends, and the warmth of their affection, were proofs of\r\nhis worth, and of their estimate of it. To give to those now living,\r\nan idea of the affliction produced by his death in the minds of all who\r\nknew him, I liken it to that lately felt by themselves on the death of\r\nhis eldest son, Peter Carr, so like him in all his endowments and moral\r\nqualities, and whose recollection can never recur without a deep-drawn\r\nsigh from the bosom of any one who knew him. You mention that I showed\r\nyou an inscription I had proposed for the tomb-stone of your father. Did\r\nI leave it in your hands to be copied? I ask the question, not that I\r\nhave any such recollection, but that I find it no longer in the place of\r\nits deposite, and think I never took it out but on that occasion. Ever\r\nand affectionately yours.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXX.--TO JOHN ADAMS, April 8, 1816\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nMonticello, April 8, 1816.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have to acknowledge your two favors of February the 16th and March the\r\n2nd, and to join sincerely in the sentiment of Mrs. Adams, and regret\r\nthat distance separates us so widely. An hour of conversation would be\r\nworth a volume of letters. But we must take things as they come.\r\n\r\nYou ask, if I would agree to live my seventy or rather seventy-three\r\nyears over again? To which I say, yea. I think with you that it is\r\na good world on the whole; that it has been framed on a principle of\r\nbenevolence, and more pleasure than pain dealt out to us. There are,\r\nindeed, (who might say nay) gloomy and hypochondriac minds, inhabitants\r\nof diseased bodies, disgusted with the present, and despairing of the\r\nfuture; always counting that the worst will happen, because it may\r\nhappen. To these I say, how much pain have cost us the evils which have\r\nnever happened! My temperament is sanguine. I steer my bark with Hope in\r\nthe head, leaving Fear astern. My hopes, indeed, sometimes fail; but not\r\noftener than the forebodings of the gloomy. There are, I acknowledge,\r\neven in the happiest life, some terrible convulsions, heavy set-offs\r\nagainst the opposite page of the account. I have often wondered for\r\nwhat good end the sensations of grief could be intended. All our\r\nother passions, within proper bounds, have an useful object. And the\r\nperfection of the moral character is, not in a stoical apathy, so\r\nhypocritically vaunted, and so untruly too, because impossible, but in a\r\njust equilibrium of all the passions. I wish the pathologists then would\r\ntell us what is the use of grief in the economy, and of what good it is\r\nthe cause, proximate or remote.\r\n\r\nDid I know Baron Grimm while at Paris? Yes, most intimately. He was the\r\npleasantest and most conversable member of the diplomatic corps while I\r\nwas there; a man of good fancy, acuteness, irony, cunning, and egoism.\r\nNo heart, not much of any science, yet enough of every one to speak\r\nits language: his forte was Belles-lettres, painting, and sculpture.\r\nIn these he was the oracle of the society, and as such, was the\r\nEmpress Catharine’s private correspondent and factor, in all things not\r\ndiplomatic. It was through him I got her permission for poor Ledyard to\r\ngo to Kamschatka, and cross over thence to the western coast of America,\r\nin order to penetrate across our continent in the opposite direction\r\nto that afterwards adopted for Lewis and Clarke: which permission she\r\nwithdrew after he had got within two hundred miles of Kamschatka, had\r\nhim seized, brought back, and set down in Poland. Although I never heard\r\nGrimm express the opinion directly, yet I always supposed him to be\r\nof the school of Diderot, D’Alembert, D’Holbach; the first of whom\r\ncommitted his system of atheism to writing in ‘_Le Bon Sens_,’ and the\r\nlast in his ‘_Systeme de la Nature_? It was a numerous school in\r\nthe Catholic countries, while the infidelity of the Protestant took\r\ngenerally the form of theism. The former always insisted that it was\r\na mere question of definition between them, the hypostasis of which on\r\nboth sides, was ‘_Nature_,’ or ‘the _Universe_’: that both agreed in the\r\norder of the existing system, but the one supposed it from eternity,\r\nthe other as having begun in time. And when the atheist descanted on\r\nthe unceasing motion and circulation of matter through the animal,\r\nvegetable, and mineral kingdoms, never resting, never annihilated,\r\nalways changing form, and under all forms gifted with the power of\r\nreproduction; the theist pointing ‘to the heavens above, and to the\r\nearth beneath, and to the waters under the earth,’ asked, if these did\r\nnot proclaim a first cause, possessing intelligence and power; power\r\nin the production, and intelligence in the design, and constant\r\npreservation of the system; urged the palpable existence of final\r\ncauses; that the eye was made to see, and the ear to hear, and not that\r\nwe see because we have eyes, and hear because we have ears; an answer\r\nobvious to the senses, as that of walking across the room, was to\r\nthe philosopher demonstrating the non-existence of motion. It was in\r\nD’Holbach’s conventicles that Rousseau imagined all the machinations\r\nagainst him were contrived and he left, in his Confessions, the most\r\nbiting anecdotes of Grimm. These appeared after I left France; but I\r\nhave heard that poor Grimm was so much afflicted by them, that he kept\r\nhis bed several weeks. I have never seen the Memoirs of Grimm. Their\r\nvolume has kept them out of our market.\r\n\r\nI have been lately amusing myself with Levi’s book, in answer to Dr.\r\nPriestley. It is a curious and tough work. His style is inelegant and\r\nincorrect, harsh and petulant to his adversary, and his reasoning flimsy\r\nenough. Some of his doctrines were new to me, particularly that of his\r\ntwo resurrections: the first, a particular one of all the dead, in body\r\nas well as soul, who are to live over again, the Jews in a state of\r\nperfect obedience to God, the other nations in a state of corporeal\r\npunishment for the sufferings they have inflicted on the Jews. And he\r\nexplains this resurrection of bodies to be only of the original stamen\r\nof Leibnitz, or the human _calus in semine masculino_, considering that\r\nas a mathematical point, insusceptible of separation or division. The\r\nsecond resurrection, a general one of souls and bodies, eternally to\r\nenjoy divine glory in the presence of the Supreme Being. He alleges that\r\nthe Jews alone preserve the doctrine of the unity of God. Yet their God\r\nwould be deemed a very indifferent man with us: and it was to correct\r\ntheir anamorphosis of the Deity, that Jesus preached, as well as to\r\nestablish the doctrine of a future state. However, Levi insists, that\r\nthat was taught in the Old Testament, and even by Moses himself and the\r\nprophets. He agrees that an anointed prince was prophesied and promised:\r\nbut denies that the character and history of Jesus had any analogy with\r\nthat of the person promised. He must be fearfully embarrassing to the\r\nHierophants of fabricated Christianity; because it is their own armor in\r\nwhich he clothes himself for the attack. For example, he takes passages\r\nof scripture from their context (which would give them a very different\r\nmeaning), strings them together, and makes them point towards what\r\nobject he pleases; he interprets them figuratively, typically,\r\nanalogically, hyperbolically; he calls in the aid of emendation,\r\ntransposition, ellipsis, metonymy, and every other figure of rhetoric;\r\nthe name of one man is taken for another, one place for another, days\r\nand weeks for months and years; and finally he avails himself of all his\r\nadvantage over his adversaries by his superior knowledge of the Hebrew,\r\nspeaking in the very language of the divine communication, while they\r\ncan only fumble on with conflicting and disputed translations. Such is\r\nthis war of giants. And how can such pigmies as you and I decide\r\nbetween them? For myself, I confess, that my head is not formed _tantas\r\ncomponere lites_. And as you began yours of March the 2nd, with a\r\ndeclaration, that you were about to write me the most frivolous letter I\r\nhad ever read, so I will close mine by saying, I have written you a full\r\nmatch for it, and by adding my affectionate respects to Mrs. Adams, and\r\nthe assurance of my constant attachment and consideration for yourself.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXI.--TO JOHN TAYLOR, May 28,1816\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN TAYLOR.\r\n\r\nMonticello, May 28,1816.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nOn my return from a long journey and considerable absence from home,\r\nI found here the copy of your ‘Enquiry into the Principles of our\r\nGovernment,’ which you had been so kind as to send me; and for which I\r\npray you to accept my thanks. The difficulties of getting new works in\r\nour situation, inland and without a single bookstore, are such as had\r\nprevented my obtaining a copy before; and letters which had accumulated\r\nduring my absence, and were calling for answers, have not yet permitted\r\nme to give to the whole a thorough reading: yet certain that you and I\r\ncould not think differently on the fundamentals of rightful government,\r\nI was impatient, and availed myself of the intervals of repose from the\r\nwriting-table, to obtain a cursory idea of the body of the work.\r\n\r\nI see in it much matter for profound reflection; much which should\r\nconfirm our adhesion, in practice, to the good principles of our\r\nconstitution, and fix our attention on what is yet to be made good. The\r\nsixth section on the good moral principles of our government, I found\r\nso interesting and replete with sound principles, as to postpone my\r\nletter-writing to its thorough perusal and consideration. Besides much\r\nother good matter, it settles unanswerably the right of instructing\r\nrepresentatives, and their duty to obey. The system of banking we have\r\nboth equally and ever reprobated. I contemplate it as a blot left in all\r\nour constitutions, which, if not covered, will end in their destruction,\r\nwhich is already hit by the gamblers in corruption, and is sweeping\r\naway in its progress the fortunes and morals of our citizens. Funding I\r\nconsider as limited, rightfully, to a redemption of the debt within the\r\nlives of a majority of the generation contracting it; every generation\r\ncoming equally, by the laws of the Creator of the world, to the free\r\npossession of the earth he made for their subsistence, unincumbered by\r\ntheir predecessors, who, like them, were but tenants for life. You have\r\nsuccessfully and completely pulverized Mr. Adams’s system of orders,\r\nand his opening the mantle of republicanism to every government of\r\nlaws, whether consistent or not with natural right. Indeed, it must be\r\nacknowledged, that the term republic is of very vague application\r\nin every language. Witness the self-styled republics of Holland,\r\nSwitzerland, Genoa, Venice, Poland. Were I to assign to this term a\r\nprecise and definite idea, I would say, that, purely and simply,\r\nit means a government by its citizens in mass, acting directly and\r\npersonally, according to rules established by the majority: and that\r\nevery other government is more or less republican, in proportion as it\r\nhas in its composition more or less of this ingredient of the direct\r\naction of the citizens. Such a government is evidently restrained to\r\nvery narrow limits of space and population. I doubt if it would be\r\npracticable beyond the extent of a New England township. The first\r\nshade from this pure element, which, like that of pure vital air, cannot\r\nsustain life of itself, would be where the powers of the government,\r\nbeing divided, should be exercised each by representatives chosen by the\r\ncitizens either _pro hac vice_, or for such short terms as should render\r\nsecure the duty of expressing the will of their constituents. This I\r\nshould consider as the nearest approach to a pure republic, which is\r\npracticable on a large scale of country or population. And we have\r\nexamples of it in some of our State constitutions, which, if not\r\npoisoned by priestcraft, would prove its excellence over all mixtures\r\nwith other elements; and, with only equal doses of poison, would still\r\nbe the best. Other shades of republicanism may be found in other\r\nforms of government, where the executive, judiciary, and legislative\r\nfunctions, and the different branches of the latter, are chosen by the\r\npeople more or less directly, for longer terms of years, or for life,\r\nor made hereditary; or where there are mixtures of authorities, some\r\ndependent on, and others independent of the peopje. The further the\r\ndeparture from direct and constant control by the citizens, the less has\r\nthe government of the ingredient of republicanism; evidently none\r\nwhere the authorities are hereditary, as in France, Venice, &c. or\r\nself-chosen, as in Holland; and little, where for life, in proportion as\r\nthe life continues in being after the act of election.\r\n\r\nThe purest republican feature in the government of our own State, is the\r\nHouse of Representatives. The Senate is equally so the first year, less\r\nthe second, and so on. The Executive still less, because not chosen by\r\nthe people directly. The Judiciary seriously anti-republican, because\r\nfor life; and the national arm wielded, as you observe, by military\r\nleaders, irresponsible but to themselves. Add to this the vicious\r\nconstitution of our county courts (to whom the justice, the executive\r\nadministration, the taxation, police, the military appointments of the\r\ncounty, and nearly all our daily concerns are confided), self-appointed,\r\nself-continued, holding their authorities for life, and with an\r\nimpossibility of breaking in on the perpetual succession of any faction\r\nonce possessed of the bench. They are, in truth, the executive, the\r\njudiciary, and the military of their respective counties, and the sum\r\nof the counties makes the State. And add, also, that one half of our\r\nbrethren who fight and pay taxes, are excluded, like Helots, from the\r\nrights of representation, as if society were instituted for the soil,\r\nand not for the men inhabiting it; or one half of these could dispose of\r\nthe rights and the will of the other half, without their consent.\r\n\r\n     What constitutes a State?\r\n     Not high-raised battlements, or lahor’d mound,\r\n     Thick wall, or moated gate;\r\n     Not cities proud, with spires and turrets crown’d;\r\n     No: men, high-minded men;\r\n     Men, who their duties know;\r\n     But know their rights; and, knowing, dare maintain.\r\n     These constitute a State.’\r\n\r\nIn the General Government, the House of Representatives is mainly\r\nrepublican; the Senate scarcely so at all, as not elected by the people\r\ndirectly, and so long secured even against those who do elect them; the\r\nExecutive more republican than the Senate, from its shorter term, its\r\nelection by the people, in practice (for they vote for A only on an\r\nassurance that he will vote for B), and because, in practice, also,\r\na principle of rotation seems to be in a course of establishment; the\r\njudiciary independent of the nation, their coercion by impeachment being\r\nfound nugatory.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the control of the people over the organs of their government\r\nbe the measure of its republicanism (and I confess I know no other\r\nmeasure), it must be agreed that our governments have much less of\r\nrepublicanism than ought to have been expected; in other words, that the\r\npeople have less regular control over their agents, than their rights\r\nand their interest require. And this I ascribe, not to any want of\r\nrepublican dispositions in those who formed these constitutions, but to\r\na submission of true principle to European authorities, to speculators\r\non government, whose fears of the people have been inspired by the\r\npopulace of their own great cities, and were unjustly entertained\r\nagainst the independent, the happy, and therefore orderly citizens of\r\nthe United States. Much I apprehend that the golden moment is past\r\nfor reforming these heresies. The functionaries of public power rarely\r\nstrengthen in their dispositions to abridge it, and an unorganized\r\ncall for timely amendment is not likely to prevail against an organized\r\nopposition to it. We are always told that things are going on well; why\r\nchange them? ‘_Chi sta bene, non si muova_,’ says the Italian, ‘Let him\r\nwho stands well, stand still.’ This is true; and I verily believe they\r\nwould go on well with us under an absolute monarch, while our\r\npresent character remains, of order, industry, and love of peace, and\r\nrestrained, as he would be, by the proper spirit of the people. But it\r\nis while it remains such, we should provide against the consequences of\r\nits deterioration. And let us rest in the hope that it will yet be done,\r\nand spare ourselves the pain of evils which may never happen.\r\n\r\nOn this view of the import of the term republic, instead of saying, as\r\nhas been said, ‘that it may mean any thing or nothing,’ we may say with\r\ntruth and meaning, that governments are more or less republican, as\r\nthey have more or less of the element of popular election and control in\r\ntheir composition: and believing, as I do, that the mass of the citizens\r\nis the safest depository of their own rights, and especially, that the\r\nevils flowing from the duperies of the people, are less injurious than\r\nthose from the egoism of their agents, I am a friend to that composition\r\nof government which has in it the most of this ingredient. And I\r\nsincerely believe, with you, that banking establishments are more\r\ndangerous than standing armies; and that the principle of spending money\r\nto be paid by posterity, under the name of funding, is but swindling\r\nfuturity on a large scale.\r\n\r\nI salute you with constant friendship and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXII.--TO FRANCIS W. GILMER, June 7,1816\r\n\r\n\r\nTO FRANCIS W. GILMER.\r\n\r\nMonticello, June 7,1816.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI received a few-days ago from Mr. Dupont the enclosed manuscript, with\r\npermission to read it, and a request, when read, to forward it to\r\nyou, in expectation that you would translate it. It is well worthy of\r\npublication for the instruction of our citizens, being profound, sound,\r\nand short. Our legislators are not sufficiently apprized of the rightful\r\nlimits of their powers: that their true office is to declare and enforce\r\nonly our natural rights and duties, and to take none of them from us.\r\nNo man has a natural right to commit aggression on the equal rights\r\nof another; and this is all from which the laws ought to restrain him:\r\nevery man is under the natural duty of contributing to the necessities\r\nof the society; and this is all the laws should enforce on him: and, no\r\nman having a natural right to be the judge between himself and another,\r\nit is his natural duty to submit to the umpirage of an impartial third.\r\nWhen the laws have declared and enforced all this, they have fulfilled\r\ntheir functions, and the idea is quite unfounded, that on entering into\r\nsociety we give up any natural right. The trial of every law by one\r\nof these texts, would lessen much the labors of our legislators, and\r\nlighten equally our municipal codes. There is a work of the first\r\norder of merit now in the press at Washington, by Destutt Tracy, on the\r\nsubject of political economy, which he brings into the compass of three\r\nhundred pages, octavo. In a preliminary discourse on the origin of the\r\nright of property, he coincides much with the principles of the present\r\nmanuscript; but is more developed, more demonstrative. He promises a\r\nfuture work on morals, in which I lament to see, that he will adopt the\r\nprinciples of Hobbes, or humiliation to human nature; that the sense of\r\njustice and injustice is not derived from our natural organization,\r\nbut founded on convention only. I lament this the more, as he is\r\nunquestionably the ablest writer living, on abstract subjects. Assuming\r\nthe fact, that the earth has been created in time, and consequently the\r\ndogma of final causes, we yield, of course, to this short syllogism.\r\nMan was created for social intercourse; but social intercourse cannot be\r\nmaintained without a sense of justice; then man must have been created\r\nwith a sense of justice. There is an error into which most of the\r\nspeculators on government have fallen, and which the well known state\r\nof society of our Indians ought, before now, to have corrected. In\r\ntheir hypothesis of the origin of government, they suppose it to have\r\ncommenced in the patriarchal or monarchical form. Our Indians are\r\nevidently in that state of nature which has passed the association of a\r\nsingle family; and not yet submitted to the authority of positive laws,\r\nor of any acknowledged magistrate. Every man, with them, is perfectly\r\nfree to follow his own inclinations. But if, in doing this, he violates\r\nthe rights of another, if the case be slight, he is punished by the\r\ndisesteem of his society, or, as we say, by public opinion; if serious,\r\nhe is tomahawked as a dangerous enemy. Their leaders conduct them by\r\nthe influence of their character only; and they follow, or not, as they\r\nplease, him of whose character for wisdom or war they have the highest\r\nopinion. Hence the origin of the parties among them adhering to\r\ndifferent leaders, and governed by their advice, not by their\r\ncommand. The Cherokees, the only tribe I know to be contemplating the\r\nestablishment of regular laws, magistrates, and government, propose\r\na government of representatives, elected from every town. But of all\r\nthings, they least think of subjecting themselves to the will of one\r\nman. This, the only instance of actual fact within our knowledge, will\r\nbe then a beginning by republican, and not by patriarchal or monarchical\r\ngovernment, as speculative writers have generally conjectured.\r\n\r\nWe have to join in mutual congratulations on the appointment of our\r\nfriend Correa, to be Minister or Envoy of Portugal, here. This, I hope,\r\nwill give him to us, for life. Nor will it at all interfere with\r\nhis botanical rambles or journeys. The government of Portugal is so\r\npeaceable and inoffensive, that it has never any altercations with its\r\nfriends. If their minister abroad writes them once a quarter that all is\r\nwell, they desire no more. I learn (though not from Correa himself) that\r\nhe thinks of paying us a visit as soon as he is through his course\r\nof lectures. Not to lose this happiness again by my absence, I have\r\ninformed him I shall set out for Poplar Forest the 20th instant, and\r\nbe back the first week of July. I wish you and he could concert\r\nyour movements so as to meet here, and that you would make this your\r\nheadquarters. It is a good central point from which to visit your\r\nconnections; and you know our practice of placing our guests at their\r\nease, by showing them we are so ourselves, and that we follow our\r\nnecessary vocations, instead of fatiguing them by hanging unremittingly\r\non their shoulders.\r\n\r\nI salute you with affectionate esteem and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXIII.*--TO BENJAMIN AUSTIN, January 9, 1816\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BENJAMIN AUSTIN.\r\n\r\nMonticello, January 9, 1816.\r\n\r\n     [* This letter was accidentally misplaced, and is now\r\n     inserted out of its regular order.]\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI acknowledge with pleasure your letter of the 9th of December last.\r\n\r\nYour opinions on the events which have taken place in France, are\r\nentirely just, so far as these events are yet developed. But we\r\nhave reason to suppose, that they have not reached their ultimate\r\ntermination. There is still an awful void between the present, and what\r\nis to be the last chapter of that history; and I fear it is to be filled\r\nwith abominations, as frightful as those which have already disgraced\r\nit. That nation is too high-minded, has too much innate force,\r\nintelligence, and elasticity, to remain quiet under its present\r\ncompression. Samson will arise in his strength, and probably will ere\r\nlong burst asunder the cords and the webs of the Philistines. But what\r\nare to be the scenes of havoc and horror, and how widely they may spread\r\nbetween the brethren of one family, our ignorance of the interior feuds\r\nand antipathies of the country places beyond our view. Whatever may be\r\nthe convulsions, we cannot but indulge the pleasing hope, they will\r\nend in the permanent establishment of a representative government;\r\na government in which the will of the people will be an effective\r\ningredient. This important element has taken root in the European mind,\r\nand will have its growth. Their rulers, sensible of this, are already\r\noffering this modification of their governments, under the plausible\r\npretence that it is a voluntary concession on their part. Had Bonaparte\r\nused his legitimate power honestly, for the establishment and support\r\nof a free government, France would now have been in prosperity and rest,\r\nand her example operating for the benefit of mankind, every nation in\r\nEurope would eventually have founded a government over which the will\r\nof the people would have had a powerful control. His improper conduct,\r\nhowever, has checked the salutary progress of principle; but the\r\nobject is fixed in the eye of nations, and they will press to its\r\naccomplishment, and to the general amelioration of the condition of\r\nman. What a germ have the freemen of the United States planted, and\r\nhow faithfully should they cherish the parent tree at home. Chagrin and\r\nmortification are the punishments our enemies receive.\r\n\r\nYou tell me I am quoted by those who wish to continue our dependence\r\non England for manufactures. There was a time when I might have been so\r\nquoted with more candor. But within the thirty years which have since\r\nelapsed, how are circumstances changed! We were then in peace; our\r\nindependent place among nations was acknowledged. A commerce which\r\noffered the raw material, in exchange for the same material after\r\nreceiving the last touch of industry, was worthy of welcome to all\r\nnations. It was expected, that those especially to whom manufacturing\r\nindustry was important, would cherish the friendship of such customers\r\nby every favor, and particularly cultivate their peace by every act\r\nof justice and friendship. Under this prospect, the question seemed\r\nlegitimate, whether, with such an immensity of unimproved land,\r\ncourting the hand of husbandry, the industry of agriculture, or that of\r\nmanufactures, would add most to the national wealth. And the doubt\r\non the utility of the American manufactures was entertained on this\r\nconsideration, chiefly, that to the labor of the husbandman a vast\r\naddition is made by the spontaneous energies of the earth on which it\r\nis employed. For one grain of wheat committed to the earth, she renders\r\ntwenty, thirty, and even fifty fold; whereas to the labor of the\r\nmanufacturer nothing is added. Pounds of flax, in his hands, on the\r\ncontrary, yield but penny weights of lace. This exchange, too, laborious\r\nas it might seem, what a field did it promise for the occupation of the\r\nocean; what a nursery for that class of citizens who were to exercise\r\nand maintain our equal rights on that element! This was the state of\r\nthings in 1785, when the Notes on Virginia were first published; when,\r\nthe ocean being open to all nations, and their common right in it\r\nacknowledged and exercised under regulations sanctioned by the assent\r\nand usage of all, it was thought that the doubt might claim some\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nBut who, in 1785, could foresee the rapid depravity which was to render\r\nthe close of that century a disgrace to the history of man? Who could\r\nhave imagined that the two most distinguished in the rank of nations,\r\nfor science and civilization, would have suddenly descended from\r\nthat honorable eminence, and setting at defiance all those moral laws\r\nestablished by the Author of Nature between nation and nation, as\r\nbetween man and man, would cover earth and sea with robberies and\r\npiracies, merely because strong enough to do it with temporal impunity,\r\nand that under this disbandment of nations from social order, we should\r\nhave been despoiled of a thousand ships, and have thousands of our\r\ncitizens reduced to Algerine slavery. Yet all this has taken place. The\r\nBritish interdicted to our vessels all harbors of the globe, without\r\nhaving first proceeded to some one of hers, there paid a tribute\r\nproportioned to the cargo, and obtained her license to proceed to the\r\nport of destination. The French declared them to be lawful prize if they\r\nhad touched at the port, or been visited by a ship of the enemy nation.\r\nThus were we completely excluded from the ocean. Compare this state\r\nof things with that of ‘85, and say whether an opinion founded in\r\nthe circumstances of that day, can be fairly applied to those of the\r\npresent. We have experienced, what we did not then believe, that there\r\nexist both profligacy and power enough to exclude us from the field of\r\ninterchange with other nations. That to be independent for the comforts\r\nof life, we must fabricate them ourselves. We must now place the\r\nmanufacturer by the side of the agriculturalist. The former question\r\nis suppressed, or rather assumes a new form. The grand inquiry now is,\r\nShall we make our own comforts, or go without them at the will of a\r\nforeign nation? He, therefore, who is now against domestic manufacture,\r\nmust be for reducing us either to dependence on that foreign nation,\r\nor to be clothed in skins, and to live like wild beasts in dens\r\nand caverns. I am not one of these. Experience has taught me that\r\nmanufactures are now as necessary to our independence as to our comfort;\r\nand if those who quote me as of a different opinion, will keep pace with\r\nme in purchasing nothing foreign, where an equivalent of domestic fabric\r\ncan be obtained, without regard to difference of price, it will not be\r\nour fault if we do not soon have a supply at home equal to our demand,\r\nand wrest that weapon of distress from the hand which has so long\r\nwantonly wielded it. If it shall be proposed to go beyond our own\r\nsupply, the question of ‘85 will then recur, Will our surplus labor be\r\nthen more beneficially employed, in the culture of the earth, or in the\r\nfabrications of art? We have time yet for consideration, before that\r\nquestion will press upon us; and the axiom to be applied will depend\r\non the circumstances which shall then exist. For in so complicated a\r\nscience as political economy, no one axiom can be laid down as wise and\r\nexpedient for all times and circumstances. Inattention to this is what\r\nhas called for this explanation, which reflection would have rendered\r\nunnecessary with the candid, while nothing will do it with those who\r\nuse the former opinion only as a stalking-horse to cover their disloyal\r\npropensities to keep us in eternal vassalage to a foreign and unfriendly\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nI salute you with assurances of great respect and esteem.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXIV.--TO WILLIAM H. CRAWFORD, June 20, 1816\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM H. CRAWFORD.\r\n\r\nMonticello, June 20, 1816.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI am about to sin against all discretion, and knowingly, by adding to\r\nthe drudgery of your letter-reading, this acknowledgment of the receipt\r\nof your favor of May the 31st, with the papers it covered. I cannot,\r\nhowever, deny myself the gratification of expressing the satisfaction I\r\nhave received, not only from the general statement of affairs at Paris,\r\nin yours of December the 12th, 1814, (as a matter of history which I had\r\nnot before received,) but most especially and superlatively, from the\r\nperusal of your letter of the 8th of the same month to Mr. Fisk, on the\r\nsubject of drawbacks. This most heterogeneous principle was transplanted\r\ninto ours from the British system, by a man whose mind was really\r\npowerful, but chained by native partialities to every thing English; who\r\nhad formed exaggerated ideas of the superior perfection of the English\r\nconstitution, the superior wisdom of their government, and sincerely\r\nbelieved it for the good of this country to make them their model in\r\nevery thing; without considering that what might be wise and good for a\r\nnation essentially commercial, and entangled in complicated intercourse\r\nwith numerous and powerful neighbors, might not be so for one\r\nessentially agricultural, and insulated by nature from the abusive\r\ngovernments of the old world.\r\n\r\nThe exercise, by our own citizens, of so much commerce as may suffice\r\nto exchange our superfluities for our wants, may be advantageous for the\r\nwhole. But it does not follow, that, with a territory so boundless, it\r\nis the interest of the whole to become a mere city of London, to carry\r\non the business of one half the world at the expense of eternal war with\r\nthe other half. The agricultural capacities of our country constitute\r\nits distinguishing feature; and the adapting our policy and pursuits to\r\nthat, is more likely to make us a numerous and happy people, than the\r\nmimicry of an Amsterdam, a Hamburgh, or a city of London. Every society\r\nhas a right to fix the fundamental principles of its association, and\r\nto say to all individuals, that, if they contemplate pursuits beyond\r\nthe limits of these principles, and involving dangers which the society\r\nchooses to avoid, they must go somewhere else for their exercise; that\r\nwe want no citizens, and still less ephemeral and pseudo-citizens, on\r\nsuch terms. We may exclude them from our territory, as we do persons\r\ninfected with disease. Such is the situation of our country. We have\r\nmost abundant resources of happiness within ourselves, which we may\r\nenjoy in peace and safety, without permitting a few citizens, infected\r\nwith the mania of rambling and gambling, to bring danger on the great\r\nmass engaged in innocent and safe pursuits at home. In your letter to\r\nFisk, you have fairly stated the alternatives between which we are to\r\nchoose: 1. licentious commerce and gambling speculations for a few, with\r\neternal war for the many; or, 2. restricted commerce, peace, and steady\r\noccupations for all. If any State in the Union will declare that it\r\nprefers separation with the first alternative, to a continuance in union\r\nwithout it, I have no hesitation in saying, ‘Let us separate.’ I would\r\nrather the States should withdraw, which are for unlimited commerce\r\nand war, and confederate with those alone which are for peace and\r\nagriculture. I know that every nation in Europe would join in sincere\r\namity with the latter, and hold the former at arm’s length, by\r\njealousies, prohibitions, restrictions, vexations, and war. No earthly\r\nconsideration could induce my consent to contract such a debt as England\r\nhas by her wars for commerce, to reduce our citizens by taxes to such\r\nwretchedness, as that laboring sixteen of the twenty-four hours, they\r\nare still unable to afford themselves bread, or barely to earn as much\r\noatmeal or potatoes as will keep soul and body together. And all this\r\nto feed the avidity of a few millionary merchants, and to keep up\r\none thousand ships of war for the protection of their commercial\r\nspeculations. I returned from Europe after our government had got under\r\nway, and had adopted from the British code the law of drawbacks. I early\r\nsaw its effects in the jealousies and vexations of Britain; and that,\r\nretaining it, we must become, like her, an essentially warring nation,\r\nand meet, in the end, the catastrophe impending over her. No one can\r\ndoubt that this alone produced the orders of council, the depredations\r\nwhich preceded, and the war which followed them. Had we carried but our\r\nown produce, and brought back but our own wants, no nation would have\r\ntroubled us. Our commercial dashers, then, have already cost us so many\r\nthousand lives, so many millions of dollars, more than their persons\r\nand all their commerce were worth. When war was declared, and especially\r\nafter Massachusetts, who had produced it, took side with the enemy\r\nwaging it, I pressed on some confidential friends in Congress to avail\r\nus of the happy opportunity of repealing the drawback; and I do rejoice\r\nto find that you are in that sentiment. You are young, and may be in the\r\nway of bringing it into effect. Perhaps time, even yet, and change of\r\ntone (for there are symptoms of that in Massachusetts), may not have\r\nobliterated altogether the sense of our late feelings and sufferings;\r\nmay not have induced oblivion of the friends we have lost, the\r\ndepredations and conflagrations we have suffered, and the debts we have\r\nincurred, and to have to labor for through the lives of the present\r\ngeneration. The earlier the repeal is proposed, the more it will be\r\nbefriended by all these recollections and considerations. This is one of\r\nthree great measures necessary to insure us permanent prosperity. This\r\npreserves our peace. A second should enable us to meet any war, by\r\nadopting the report of the war department, for placing the force of\r\nthe nation at effectual command: and a third should insure resources\r\nof money by the suppression of all paper circulation during peace, and\r\nlicensing that of the nation alone during war. The metallic medium of\r\nwhich we should be possessed at the commencement of a war, would be\r\na sufficient fund for all the loans we should need through its\r\ncontinuance; and if the national bills issued, be bottomed (as is\r\nindispensable) on pledges of specific taxes for their redemption\r\nwithin certain and moderate epochs, and be of proper denominations for\r\ncirculation, no interest on them would be necessary or just, because\r\nthey would answer to every one the purposes of the metallic money\r\nwithdrawn and replaced by them. But possibly these may be the dreams of\r\nan old man, or that the occasions of realizing them may have passed away\r\nwithout return. A government regulating itself by what is wise and just\r\nfor the many, uninfluenced by the local and selfish views of the few\r\nwho direct their affairs, has not been seen, perhaps, on earth. Or if it\r\nexisted, for a moment, at the birth of ours, it would not be easy to fix\r\nthe term of its continuance. Still, I believe it does exist here in a\r\ngreater degree than any where else; and for its growth and continuance,\r\nas well as for your personal health and happiness, I offer sincere\r\nprayers, with the homage of my respect and esteem.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXV.--TO SAMUEL KERCHIVAL, July 12, 1816\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL KERCHIVAL.\r\n\r\nMonticello, July 12, 1816.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI duly received your favor of June the 13th, with the copy of the\r\nletters on the calling a convention, on which you are pleased to ask\r\nmy opinion. I have not been in the habit of mysterious reserve on any\r\nsubject, nor of buttoning up my opinions within my own doublet. On\r\nthe contrary, while in public service especially, I thought the public\r\nentitled to frankness, and intimately to know whom they employed. But\r\nI am now retired: I resign myself, as a passenger, with confidence to\r\nthose at present at the helm, and ask but for rest, peace, and good\r\nwill. The question you propose, on equal representation, has become a\r\nparty one, in which I wish to take no public share. Yet, if it be asked\r\nfor your own satisfaction only, and not to be quoted before the public,\r\nI have no motive to withhold it, and the less from you, as it coincides\r\nwith your own. At the birth of our republic, I committed that opinion\r\nto the world, in the draught of a constitution annexed to the Notes\r\non Virginia, in which a provision was inserted for a representation\r\npermanently equal. The infancy of the subject at that moment, and our\r\ninexperience of self-government, occasioned gross departures in that\r\ndraught from genuine republican canons. In truth, the abuses of monarchy\r\nhad so much filled all the space of political contemplation, that we\r\nimagined every thing republican which was not monarchy. We had not yet\r\npenetrated to the mother principle, that ‘governments are republican\r\nonly in proportion as they embody the will of their people, and execute\r\nit.’ Hence, our first constitutions had really no leading principle in\r\nthem. But experience and reflection have but more and more confirmed me\r\nin the particular importance of the equal representation then proposed.\r\nOn that point, then, I am entirely in sentiment with your letters; and\r\nonly lament that a copyright of your pamphlet prevents their appearance\r\nin the newspapers, where alone they would be generally read, and produce\r\ngeneral effect. The present vacancy too, of other matter, would give\r\nthem place in every paper, and bring the question home to every man’s\r\nconscience.\r\n\r\nBut inequality of representation in both Houses of our legislature, is\r\nnot the only republican heresy in this first essay of our revolutionary\r\npatriots at forming a constitution. For let it be agreed that a\r\ngovernment is republican in proportion as every member composing it has\r\nhis equal voice in the direction of its concerns, (not indeed in person,\r\nwhich would be impracticable beyond the limits of a city, or small\r\ntownship, but) by representatives chosen by himself, and responsible to\r\nhim at short periods, and let us bring to the test of this canon every\r\nbranch of our constitution.\r\n\r\nIn the legislature, the House of Representatives is chosen by less than\r\nhalf the people, and not at all in proportion to those who do choose.\r\nThe Senate are still more disproportionate, and for long terms of\r\nirresponsibility. In the Executive, the Governor is entirely independent\r\nof the choice of the people, and of their control; his Council equally\r\nso, and at best but a fifth wheel to a wagon. In the Judiciary, the\r\njudges of the highest courts are dependent on none but themselves.\r\nIn England, where judges were named and removable at the will of an\r\nhereditary executive, from which branch most misrule was feared, and has\r\nflowed, it was a great point gained, by fixing them for life, to make\r\nthem independent of that executive. But in a government founded on\r\nthe public will, this principle operates in an opposite direction,\r\nand against that will. There, too, they were still removable on a\r\nconcurrence of the executive and legislative branches. But we have made\r\nthem independent of the nation itself. They are irremovable, but by\r\ntheir own body, for any depravities of conduct, and even by their own\r\nbody for the imbecilities of dotage. The justices of the inferior\r\ncourts are self-chosen, are for life, and perpetuate their own body in\r\nsuccession for ever, so that a faction once possessing themselves of\r\nthe bench of a county, can never be broken up, but hold their county in\r\nchains, for ever indissoluble. Yet these justices are the real executive\r\nas well as judiciary, in all our minor and most ordinary concerns. They\r\ntax us at will; fill the office of sheriff, the most important of all\r\nthe executive officers of the county; name nearly all our military\r\nleaders, which leaders, once named, are removable but by themselves. The\r\njuries, our judges of all fact, and of law when they choose it, are\r\nnot selected by the people, nor amenable to them. They are chosen by an\r\nofficer named by the court and executive. Chosen, did I say? Picked up\r\nby the sheriff from the loungings of the court-yard, after every thing\r\nrespectable has retired from it. Where then is our republicanism to be\r\nfound? Not in our constitution certainly, but merely in the spirit of\r\nour people. That would oblige even a despot to govern us republicanly.\r\nOwing to this spirit, and to nothing in the form of our constitution,\r\nall things have gone well. But this fact, so triumphantly misquoted by\r\nthe enemies of reformation, is not the fruit of our constitution, but\r\nhas prevailed in spite of it. Our functionaries have done well, because\r\ngenerally honest men. If any were not so, they feared to show it.\r\n\r\nBut it will be said, it is easier to find faults than to amend them. I\r\ndo not think their amendment so difficult as is pretended. Only lay down\r\ntrue principles, and adhere to them inflexibly. Do not be frightened\r\ninto their surrender by the alarms of the timid, or the croakings of\r\nwealth against the ascendancy of the people. If experience be called\r\nfor, appeal to that of our fifteen or twenty governments for forty\r\nyears, and show me where the people have done half the mischief in these\r\nforty years, that a single despot would have done in a single year;\r\nor show half the riots and rebellions, the crimes and the punishments,\r\nwhich have taken place in any single nation, under Kingly government,\r\nduring the same period. The true foundation of republican government\r\nis the equal right of every citizen, in his person and property, and\r\nin their management. Try by this, as a tally, every provision of our\r\nconstitution, and see if it hangs directly on the will of the people.\r\nReduce your legislature to a convenient number for full, but orderly\r\ndiscussion. Let every man who fights or pays, exercise his just and\r\nequal right in their election. Submit them to approbation or rejection\r\nat short intervals. Let the executive be chosen in the same way, and for\r\nthe same term, by those whose agent he is to be; and leave no screen of\r\na council behind which to skulk from responsibility. It has been thought\r\nthat the people are not competent electors of judges learned in the law.\r\nBut I do not know that this is true, and if doubtful, we should follow\r\nprinciple. In this, as in many other elections, they would be guided by\r\nreputation, which would not err oftener, perhaps, than the present mode\r\nof appointment. In one State of the Union, at least, it has been long\r\ntried, and with the most satisfactory success. The judges of Connecticut\r\nhave been chosen by the people every six months, for nearly two\r\ncenturies, and I believe there has hardly ever been an instance\r\nof change; so powerful is the curb of incessant responsibility. If\r\nprejudice, however, derived from a monarchical institution, is still\r\nto prevail against the vital elective principle of our own, and if the\r\nexisting example among ourselves of periodical election of judges by\r\nthe people be still mistrusted, let us at least not adopt the evil, and\r\nreject the good, of the English precedent; let us retain a movability\r\non the concurrence of the executive and legislative branches, and\r\nnomination by the executive alone. Nomination to office is an executive\r\nfunction. To give it to the legislature, as we do, is a violation of\r\nthe principle of the separation of powers. It swerves the members from\r\ncorrectness, by temptations to intrigue for office themselves, and to\r\na corrupt barter of votes; and destroys responsibility by dividing it\r\namong a multitude. By leaving nomination in its proper place, among\r\nexecutive functions, the principle of the distribution of power is\r\npreserved, and responsibility weighs with its heaviest force on a single\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nThe organization of our county administrations may be thought more\r\ndifficult. But follow principle, and the knot unties itself. Divide the\r\ncounties into wards of such size as that every citizen can attend when\r\ncalled on, and act in person. Ascribe to them the government of their\r\nwards in all things relating to themselves exclusively. A justice,\r\nchosen by themselves, in each, a constable, a military company, a\r\npatrol, a school, the care of their own poor, their own portion of the\r\npublic roads, the choice of one or more jurors to serve in some court,\r\nand the delivery, within their own wards, of their own votes for\r\nall elective officers of higher sphere, will relieve the county\r\nadministration of nearly all its business, will have it better done, and\r\nby making every citizen an acting member of the government, and in the\r\noffices nearest and most interesting to him, will attach him by\r\nhis strongest feelings to the independence of his country, and its\r\nrepublican constitution. The justices thus chosen by every ward, would\r\nconstitute the county court, would do its judiciary business, direct\r\nroads and bridges, levy county and poor rates, and administer all the\r\nmatters of common interest to the whole county. These wards, called\r\ntownships in New England, are the vital principle of their governments,\r\nand have proved themselves the wisest invention ever devised by the\r\nwit of man for the perfect exercise of self-government, and for its\r\npreservation. We should thus marshal our government into, 1. The general\r\nfederal republic, for all concerns foreign and federal; 2. That of the\r\nState, for what relates to our own citizens exclusively; 3. The county\r\nrepublics, for the duties and concerns of the county; and, 4. The ward\r\nrepublics, for the small, and yet numerous and interesting concerns of\r\nthe neighborhood: and in government, as well as in every other business\r\nof life, it is by division and sub-division of duties alone, that all\r\nmatters, great and small, can be managed to perfection. And the whole\r\nis cemented by giving to every citizen, personally, a part in the\r\nadministration of the public affairs.\r\n\r\nThe sum of these amendments is, 1. General suffrage. 2. Equal\r\nrepresentation in the legislature. 3. An executive chosen by the people.\r\n4. Judges elective or amovable. 5. Justices, jurors, and sheriffs\r\nelective. 6. Ward divisions. And, 7. Periodical amendments of the\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nI have thrown out these, as loose heads of amendment, for consideration\r\nand correction: and their object is to secure self-government by the\r\nrepublicanism of our constitution, as well as by the spirit of the\r\npeople; and to nourish and perpetuate that spirit. I am not among those\r\nwho fear the people. They, and not the rich, are our dependence for\r\ncontinued freedom. And to preserve their independence, we must not\r\nlet our rulers load us with perpetual debt. We must make our election\r\nbetween economy and liberty, or profusion and servitude. If we run into\r\nsuch debts, as that we must be taxed in our meat and in our drink, in\r\nour necessaries and our comforts, in our labors and our amusements, for\r\nour callings and our creeds, as the people of England are, our people,\r\nlike them, must come to labor sixteen hours in the twenty-four, give the\r\nearnings of fifteen of these to the government for their debts and daily\r\nexpenses; and the sixteenth being insufficient to afford us bread, we\r\nmust live, as they now do, on oatmeal and potatoes; have no time to\r\nthink, no means of calling the mismanagers to account; but be glad to\r\nobtain subsistence by hiring ourselves to rivet their chains on the\r\nnecks of our fellow-sufferers. Our land-holders, too, like theirs,\r\nretaining indeed the title and stewardship of estates called theirs,\r\nbut held really in trust for the treasury, must wander, like theirs, in\r\nforeign countries, and be contented with penury, obscurity, exile, and\r\nthe glory of the nation. This example reads to us the salutary lesson\r\nthat private fortunes are destroyed by public, as well as by private\r\nextravagance. And this is the tendency of all human governments. A\r\ndeparture from principle in one instance, becomes a precedent for a\r\nsecond; that second for a third; and so on, till the bulk of the society\r\nis reduced to be mere automatons of misery, to have no sensibilities\r\nleft but for sinning and suffering. Then begins, indeed, the _bellum\r\nomnium in omnia_, which some philosophers observing to be so general\r\nin this world, have mistaken it for the natural, instead of the abusive\r\nstate of man. And the fore-horse of this frightful team is public debt.\r\nTaxation follows that, and in its train wretchedness and oppression.\r\n\r\nSome men look at constitutions with sanctimonious reverence, and deem\r\nthem, like the ark of the covenant, too sacred to be touched. They\r\nascribe to the men of the preceding age a wisdom more than human, and\r\nsuppose what they did to be beyond amendment. I knew that age well: I\r\nbelonged to it, and labored with it. It deserved well of its country.\r\nIt was very like the present, but without the experience of the present;\r\nand forty years of experience in government is worth a century of\r\nbook-reading: and this they would say themselves, were they to rise\r\nfrom the dead. I am certainly not an advocate for frequent and untried\r\nchanges in laws and constitutions. I think moderate imperfections had\r\nbetter be borne with; because, when once known, we accommodate ourselves\r\nto them, and find practical means of correcting their ill effects. But\r\nI know, also, that laws and institutions must go hand in hand with\r\nthe progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more\r\nenlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths disclosed,\r\nand manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances,\r\ninstitutions must advance also, and keep pace with the times. We might\r\nas well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a\r\nboy, as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their\r\nbarbarous ancestors. It is this preposterous idea which has lately\r\ndeluged Europe in blood. Their monarchs, instead of wisely yielding\r\nto the gradual changes of circumstances, of favoring progressive\r\naccommodation to progressive improvement, have clung to old abuses,\r\nentrenched themselves behind steady habits, and obliged their subjects\r\nto seek through blood and violence rash and ruinous innovations, which,\r\nhad they been referred to the peaceful deliberations and collected\r\nwisdom of the nation, would have been put into acceptable and salutary\r\nforms. Let us follow no such examples, nor weakly believe that one\r\ngeneration is not as capable as another of taking care of itself, and of\r\nordering its own affairs. Let us, as our sister States have done, avail\r\nourselves of our reason and experience, to correct the crude essays of\r\nour first and unexperienced, although wise, virtuous, and well-meaning\r\ncouncils. And, lastly, let us provide in our constitution for its\r\nrevision at stated periods. What these periods should be, nature herself\r\nindicates. By the European tables of mortality, of the adults living at\r\nany one moment of time, a majority will be dead in about nineteen years.\r\nAt the end of that period, then, a new majority is come into place; or,\r\nin other words, a new generation. Each generation is as independent of\r\nthe one preceding, as that was of all which had gone before. It has,\r\nthen, like them, a right to choose for itself the form of government\r\nit believes most promotive of its own happiness; consequently, to\r\naccommodate to the circumstances in which it finds itself, that received\r\nfrom its predecessors: and it is for the peace and good of mankind,\r\nthat a solemn opportunity of doing this every nineteen or twenty years,\r\nshould be provided by the constitution; so that it may be handed on,\r\nwith periodical repairs, from generation to generation, to the end of\r\ntime, if any thing human can so long endure. It is now forty years since\r\nthe constitution of Virginia was formed. The same tables inform us,\r\nthat, within that period, two thirds of the adults then living are now\r\ndead. Have then the remaining third, even if they had the wish, the\r\nright to hold in obedience to their will, and to laws heretofore made\r\nby them, the other two thirds, who, with themselves, compose the present\r\nmass of adults? If they have not, who has? The dead? But the dead have\r\nno rights. They are nothing; and nothing cannot own something. Where\r\nthere is no substance, there can be no accident. This corporeal globe,\r\nand every thing upon it, belong to its present corporeal inhabitants,\r\nduring their generation. They alone have a right to direct what is the\r\nconcern of themselves alone, and to declare the law of that direction:\r\nand this declaration can only be made by their majority. That majority,\r\nthen, has a right to depute representatives to a convention, and to make\r\nthe constitution what they think will be best for themselves. But how\r\ncollect their voice? This is the real difficulty. If invited by private\r\nauthority to county or district meetings, these divisions are so large,\r\nthat few will attend; and their voice will be imperfectly or falsely\r\npronounced. Here, then, would be one of the advantages of the ward\r\ndivisions I have proposed. The mayor of every ward, on a question like\r\nthe present, would call his ward together, take the simple yea or nay of\r\nits members, convey these to the county court, who would hand on those\r\nof all its wards to the proper general authority; and the voice of\r\nthe whole people would be thus fairly, fully, and peaceably expressed,\r\ndiscussed, and decided by the common reason of the society. If this\r\navenue be shut to the call of sufferance, it will make itself heard\r\nthrough that of force, and we shall go on, as other nations are doing,\r\nin the endless circle of oppression, rebellion, reformation; and\r\noppression, rebellion, reformation, again; and so on, for ever.\r\n\r\nThese, Sir, are my opinions of the governments we see among men, and of\r\nthe principles by which alone we may prevent our own from falling into\r\nthe same dreadful track. I have given them at greater length than your\r\nletter called for. But I cannot say things by halves; and I confide them\r\nto your honor, so to use them as to preserve me from the gridiron of the\r\npublic papers. If you shall approve and enforce them, as you have done\r\nthat of equal representation, they may do some good. If not, keep them\r\nto yourself as the effusions of withered age, and useless time. I\r\nshall, with not the Less truth, assure you of my great respect and\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXVI.--TO JOHN TAYLOR, July 21, 1816\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN TAYLOR.\r\n\r\nMonticello, July 21, 1816.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYours of the 10th is received, and I have to acknowledge a copious\r\nsupply of the turnip-seed requested. Besides taking care myself, I\r\nshall endeavor again to commit it to the depository of the neighborhood,\r\ngenerally found to be the best precaution against losing a good thing.\r\nI will add a word on the political part of our letters. I believe we do\r\nnot differ on either of the points you suppose. On education certainly\r\nnot; of which the proofs are my bill for the diffusion of knowledge,\r\nproposed near forty years ago, and my uniform endeavors, to this day,\r\nto get our counties divided into wards, one of the principal objects of\r\nwhich is, the establishment of a primary school in each. But education\r\nnot being a branch of municipal government, but, like the other arts\r\nand sciences, an accident only, I did not place it, with election, as a\r\nfundamental member in the structure of government. Nor, I believe, do\r\nwe differ as to the county courts. I acknowledge the value of this\r\ninstitution; that it is in truth our principal executive and judiciary,\r\nand that it does much for little pecuniary reward. It is their\r\nself-appointment I wish to correct; to find some means of breaking up\r\na cabal, when such a one gets possession of the bench. When this takes\r\nplace, it becomes the most afflicting of tyrannies, because its powers\r\nare so various, and exercised on every thing most immediately around\r\nus. And how many instances have you and I known of these monopolies of\r\ncounty administration! I knew a county in which a particular family (a\r\nnumerous one) got possession of the bench, and for a whole generation.\r\nnever admitted a man on it who was not of its clan or connection. 1 know\r\na county now of one thousand and five hundred militia, of which sixty\r\nare federalists. Its court is of thirty members, of whom twenty are\r\nfederalists, (every third man of the sect.) There are large and populous\r\ndistricts in it without a justice, because without a federalist\r\nfor appointment: the militia are as disproportionably under federal\r\nofficers. And there is no authority on earth which can break up this\r\njunto, short of a general convention. The remaining one thousand four\r\nhundred and forty, free, fighting, and paying citizens, are governed\r\nby men neither of their choice nor confidence, and without a hope\r\nof relief. They are certainly excluded from the blessings of a free\r\ngovernment for life, and indefinitely, for aught the constitution has\r\nprovided. This solecism may be called any thing but republican, and\r\nought undoubtedly to be corrected. I salute you with constant friendship\r\nand respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXVII.--TO SAMUEL KERCHIVAL, September 5, 1816\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL KERCHIVAL.\r\n\r\nMonticello, September 5, 1816.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nYour letter of August the 16th is just received. That which I wrote to\r\nyou under the address of H. Tompkinson, was intended for the author\r\nof the pamphlet you were so kind as to send me, and therefore, in your\r\nhands, found its true destination. But I must beseech you, Sir, not to\r\nadmit a possibility of its being published. Many good people will revolt\r\nfrom its doctrines, and my wish is to offend nobody; to leave to those\r\nwho are to live under it, the settlement of their own constitution, and\r\nto pass in peace the remainder of my time. If those opinions are sound,\r\nthey will occur to others, and will prevail by their own weight,\r\nwithout the aid of names. I am glad to see that the Staunton meeting has\r\nrejected the idea of a limited convention. The article, however, nearest\r\nmy heart, is the division of the counties into wards. These will be pure\r\nand elementary republics, the sum of all which, taken together, composes\r\nthe State, and will make of the whole a true democracy as to the\r\nbusiness of the wards, which is that of nearest and daily concern.\r\nThe affairs of the larger sections, of counties, of States, and of\r\nthe Union, not admitting personal transaction by the people, will be\r\ndelegated to agents elected by themselves; and representation will thus\r\nbe substituted, where personal action becomes impracticable. Yet,\r\neven over these representative organs, should they become corrupt and\r\nperverted, the division into wards constituting the people, in their\r\nwards, a regularly organized power, enables them by that organization\r\nto crush, regularly and peaceably, the usurpations of their unfaithful\r\nagents, and rescues them from the dreadful necessity of doing it\r\ninsurrectionally. In this way we shall be as republican as a large\r\nsociety can be; and secure the continuance of purity in our government,\r\nby the salutary, peaceable, and regular control of the people. No other\r\ndepositories of power have ever yet been found, which did not end in\r\nconverting to their own profit the earnings of those committed to their\r\ncharge. George the III., in execution of the trust confided to him, has,\r\nwithin his own day, loaded the inhabitants of Great Britain with debts\r\nequal to the whole fee-simple value of their island, and under pretext\r\nof governing it, has alienated its whole soil to creditors who could\r\nlend money to be lavished on priests, pensions, plunder, and perpetual\r\nwar. This would not have been so, had the people retained organized\r\nmeans of acting on their agents. In this example, then, let us read a\r\nlesson for ourselves, and not ‘go, and do likewise.’\r\n\r\nSince writing my letter of July the 12th, I have been told, that on the\r\nquestion of equal representation, our fellow-citizens in some sections\r\nof the State claim peremptorily a right of representation for their\r\nslaves. Principle will, in this, as in most other cases, open the way\r\nfor us to correct conclusion. Were our State a pure democracy, in which\r\nall its inhabitants should meet together to transact all their business,\r\nthere would yet be excluded from their deliberations, 1. Infants, until\r\narrived at years of discretion. 2. Women, who, to prevent depravation\r\nof morals, and ambiguity of issue, could not mix promiscuously in the\r\npublic meetings of men. 3, Slaves, from whom the unfortunate state of\r\nthings with us takes away the rights of will and of property. Those,\r\nthen, who have no will, could be permitted to exercise none in the\r\npopular assembly; and of course could delegate none to an agent in a\r\nrepresentative assembly. The business, in the first case, would be done\r\nby qualified citizens only; and, in the second, by the representatives\r\nof qualified citizens only. It is true, that in the general\r\nconstitution, our State is allowed a larger representation on account\r\nof its slaves. But every one knows, that that constitution was a\r\nmatter of compromise; a capitulation between conflicting interests\r\nand opinions. In truth, the condition of different descriptions of\r\ninhabitants in any country is a matter of municipal arrangement, of\r\nwhich no foreign country has a right to take notice. All its inhabitants\r\nare men as to them. Thus, in the New England States, none have the\r\npowers of citizens but those whom they call freemen; and none are\r\nfreemen Until admitted by a vote of the freemen of the town. Yet, in the\r\nGeneral Government, these non-freemen are counted in their quantum of\r\nrepresentation and of taxation. So, slaves with us have no powers as\r\ncitizens; yet, in representation in the General Government, they count\r\nin the proportion of three to five; and so also in taxation. Whether\r\nthis is equal, is not here the question. It is a capitulation of\r\ndiscordant sentiments and circumstances, and is obligatory on that\r\nground. But this view shows there is no inconsistency in claiming\r\nrepresentation for them from the other States, and refusing it within\r\nour own.\r\n\r\nAccept the renewal of assurances of my respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXVIII.--TO JOHN ADAMS, October 14, 1816\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS,\r\n\r\nMonticello, October 14, 1816.\r\n\r\nYour letter, dear Sir, of May the 6th, had already well explained the\r\nuses of grief. That of September the 3rd, with equal truth, adduces\r\ninstances of its abuse; and when we put into the same scale these\r\nabuses, with the afflictions of soul which even the uses of grief cost\r\nus, we may consider its value in the economy of the human being, as\r\nequivocal at least. Those afflictions cloud too great a portion of\r\nlife, to find a counterpoise in any benefits derived from its uses. For\r\nsetting aside its paroxyms on the occasions of special bereavements, all\r\nthe latter years of aged men are overshadowed with its gloom. Whither,\r\nfor instance, can you and I look without seeing the graves of those we\r\nhave known? And whom can we call up, of our early companions, who has\r\nnot left us to regret his loss? This, indeed, may be one of the salutary\r\neffects of grief; inasmuch as it prepares us to loose ourselves also\r\nwithout repugnance. Doctor Freeman’s instances of female levity cured by\r\ngrief, are certainly to the point, and constitute an item of credit in\r\nthe account we examine. I was much mortified by the loss of the Doctor’s\r\nvisit, by my absence from home. To have shown how much I feel indebted\r\nto you for making good people known to me, would have been one pleasure;\r\nand to have enjoyed that of his conversation, and the benefits of\r\nhis information, so favorably reported by my family, would have been\r\nanother. I returned home on the third day after his departure. The loss\r\nof such visits is among the sacrifices which my divided residence costs\r\nme.\r\n\r\nYour undertaking the twelve volumes of Dupuis, is a degree of heroism\r\nto which I could not have aspired even in my younger days. I have been\r\ncontented with the humble achievement of reading the analysis of his\r\nwork by Destutt Tracy, in two hundred pages, octavo. I believe I should\r\nhave ventured on his own abridgment of the work, in one octavo volume,\r\nhad it ever come to my hands; but the marrow of it in Tracy has\r\nsatisfied my appetite: and even in that, the preliminary discourse of\r\nthe analyzer himself, and his conclusion, are worth more in my eye than\r\nthe body of the work. For the object of that seems to be to smother all\r\nhistory under the mantle of allegory. If histories so unlike as those\r\nof Hercules and Jesus, can, by a fertile imagination and allegorical\r\ninterpretations, be brought to the same tally, no line of distinction\r\nremains between fact and fancy. As this pithy morsel will not\r\noverburthen the mail in passing and repassing between Quincy and\r\nMonticello, I send it for your perusal. Perhaps it will satisfy you, as\r\nit has me; and may save you the labor of reading twenty-four times its\r\nvolume. I have said to you that it was written by Tracy; and I had so\r\nentered it on the title-page, as I usually do on anonymous works whose\r\nauthors are known to me. But Tracy requested me not to betray his\r\nanonyme, for reasons which may not yet, perhaps, have ceased to weigh. I\r\nam bound, then, to make the same reserve with you. Destutt-Tracy is, in\r\nmy judgment, the ablest writer living on intellectual subjects, or the\r\noperations of the understanding. His three octavo volumes on Ideology,\r\nwhich constitute the foundation of what he has since written, I have not\r\nentirely read; because I am not fond of reading what is merely abstract,\r\nand unapplied immediately to some useful science. Bonaparte, with his\r\nrepeated derisions of Ideologists (squinting at this author) has by\r\nthis time felt that true wisdom does not lie in mere practice without\r\nprinciple. The next work Tracy wrote was the Commentary on Montesquieu,\r\nnever published in the original, because not safe; but translated and\r\npublished in Philadelphia, yet without the author’s name. He has since\r\npermitted his name to be mentioned. Although called a Commentary, it is,\r\nin truth, an elementary work on the principles of government, comprised\r\nin about three hundred pages octavo. He has lately published a third\r\nwork on Political Economy, comprising the whole subject within about\r\nthe same compass; in which all its principles are demonstrated with\r\nthe severity of Euclid, and, like him, without ever using a superfluous\r\nword. I have procured this to be translated, and have been four years\r\nendeavoring to get it printed: but, as yet, without success. In the mean\r\ntime, the author has published the original in France, which he thought\r\nunsafe while Bonaparte was in power. No printed copy, I believe, has yet\r\nreached this country. He has his fourth and last work now in the press\r\nat Paris, closing, as he conceives, the circle of metaphysical sciences.\r\nThis work, which is on Ethics, I have not seen, but suspect I shall\r\ndiffer from it in its foundation, although not in its deductions. I\r\ngather from his other works that he adopts the principle of Hobbes,\r\nthat justice is founded in contract solely, and does not result from the\r\nconstitution of man. I believe, on the contrary, that it is instinct and\r\ninnate, that the moral sense is as much a part of our constitution as\r\nthat of feeling, seeing, or hearing; as a wise creator must have seen to\r\nbe necessary in an animal destined to live in society: that every human\r\nmind feels pleasure in doing good to another: that the non-existence of\r\njustice is not to be inferred from the fact that the same act is deemed\r\nvirtuous and right in one society which is held vicious and wrong\r\nin another; because, as the circumstances and opinions of different\r\nsocieties vary, so the acts which may do them right or wrong must vary\r\nalso; for virtue does not consist in the act we do, but in the end it\r\nis to effect. If it is to effect the happiness of him to whom it\r\nis directed, it is virtuous, while, in a society under different\r\ncircumstances and opinions, the same act might produce pain, and would\r\nbe vicious. The essence of virtue is in doing good to others, while what\r\nis good may be one thing in one society, and its contrary in another.\r\nYet, however we may differ as to the foundation of morals (and as\r\nmany foundations have been assumed as there are writers on the subject\r\nnearly), so correct a thinker as Tracy will give us a sound system of\r\nmorals. And, indeed, it is remarkable, that so many writers, setting out\r\nfrom so many different premises, yet meet all in the same conclusions.\r\nThis looks as if they were guided unconsciously, by the unerring-hand of\r\ninstinct.\r\n\r\nYour history of the Jesuits, by what name of the author or other\r\ndescription is it to be inquired for?\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of the present situation of England? Is not this the\r\ngreat and fatal crush of their funding system, which, like death, has\r\nbeen foreseen by all, but its hour, like that of death, hidden from\r\nmortal prescience? It appears to me that all the circumstances now exist\r\nwhich render recovery desperate. The interest of the national debt is\r\nnow equal to such a portion of the profits of all the land and the labor\r\nof the island, as not to leave enough for the subsistence of those\r\nwho labor. Hence the owners of the land abandon it and retire to other\r\ncountries, and the laborer has not enough of his earnings left to him\r\nto cover his back and to fill his belly. The local insurrections, now\r\nalmost general, are of the hungry and the naked, who cannot be quieted\r\nbut by food and raiment. But where are the means of feeding and clothing\r\nthem? The landholder has nothing of his own to give; he is but the\r\nfiduciary of those who have lent him money; the lender is so taxed in\r\nhis meat, drink, and clothing, that he has but a bare subsistence left.\r\nThe landholder, then, must give up his land, or the lender his debt,\r\nor they must compromise by giving up each one half. But will either\r\nconsent, peaceably, to such an abandonment of property? Or must it not\r\nbe settled by civil conflict? If peaceably compromised, will they agree\r\nto risk another ruin under the same government unreformed? I think not;\r\nbut I would rather know what you think; because you have lived with\r\nJohn Bull, and know better than I do the character of his herd. I salute\r\nMrs. Adams and yourself with every sentiment of affectionate cordiality\r\nand respect;\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXIX.--TO JOHN ADAMS, TO JOHN ADAMS\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nMonticello, January 11, 1817.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nForty-three volumes read in one year, and twelve of them quarto! Dear\r\nSir, how I envy you! Half a dozen octavos in that space of time are as\r\nmuch as I am allowed. I can read by candlelight only, and stealing long\r\nhours from my rest: nor would that time be indulged to me, could I by\r\nthat light see to write. From sunrise to one or two o’clock, and often\r\nfrom dinner to dark, I am drudging at the writing-table. And all this\r\nto answer letters into which neither interest nor inclination on my part\r\nenters; and often from persons whose names I have never before heard.\r\nYet, writing civilly, it is hard to refuse them civil answers. This is\r\nthe burthen of my life, a very grievous one indeed, and one which I must\r\nget rid of. Delaplaine lately requested me to give him a line on the\r\nsubject of his book; meaning, as I well knew, to publish it. This I\r\nconstantly refuse; but in this instance yielded, that in saying a\r\nword for him, I might say two for myself. I expressed in it freely\r\nmy sufferings from this source; hoping it would have the effect of an\r\nindirect appeal to the discretion of those, strangers and others, who,\r\nin the most friendly dispositions, oppress me with their concerns,\r\ntheir pursuits, their projects, inventions, and speculations, political,\r\nmoral, religious, mechanical, mathematical, historical, &c. &c. &c.\r\nI hope the appeal will bring me relief, and that I shall be left to,\r\nexercise and enjoy correspondence with the friends I love, and on\r\nsubjects which they, or my own inclinations, present. In that case, your\r\nletters shall not be so long on my files unanswered, as sometimes they\r\nhave been to my great mortification.\r\n\r\nTo advert now to the subjects of those of December the 12th and 16th.\r\nTracy’s Commentaries on Montesquieu have never been published in the\r\noriginal. Duane printed a translation from the original manuscript a few\r\nyears ago. It sold, I believe, readily, and whether a copy can now\r\nbe had, I doubt. If it can, you will receive it from my bookseller in\r\nPhiladelphia, to whom I now write for that purpose. Tracy comprehends,\r\nunder the word ‘Ideology’ all the subjects which the French term\r\n_Morale_, as the correlative to _Physique_, His works on Logic,\r\nGovernment, Political Economy, and Morality, he considers as making up\r\nthe circle of ideological subjects, or of those which are within the\r\nscope of the understanding, and not of the senses. His Logic occupies\r\nexactly the ground of Locke’s work on the Understanding. The translation\r\nof that on Political Economy is now printing; but it is no translation\r\nof mine. I have only had the correction of it, which was, indeed, very\r\nlaborious. _Le premier jet_ having been by some one who understood\r\nneither French nor English, it was impossible to make it more than\r\nfaithful. But it is a valuable work.\r\n\r\nThe result of your fifty or sixty years of religious reading in the four\r\nwords, ‘Be just and good,’ is that in which all our inquiries must end;\r\nas the riddles of all the priesthoods end in four more, ‘_Ubi panis, ibi\r\ndeus_.’ What all agree in, is probably right; what no two agree in, most\r\nprobably wrong. One of our fan-coloring biographers, who paints small\r\nmen as very great, inquired of me lately, with real affection too,\r\nwhether he might consider as authentic, the change in my religion much\r\nspoken of in some circles. Now this supposed that they knew what had\r\nbeen my religion before, taking for it the word of their priests, whom\r\nI certainly never made the confidants of my creed. My answer was, ‘Say\r\nnothing of my religion. It is known to my God and myself alone. Its\r\nevidence before the world is to be sought in my life; if that has been\r\nhonest and dutiful to society, the religion which has regulated it\r\ncannot be a bad one.’ Affectionately adieu.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXL.--TO JOHN ADAMS, May 5, 1817\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nMonticello, May 5, 1817.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nAbsences and avocations had prevented my acknowledging your favor of\r\nFebruary the 2nd, when that of April the 19th arrived. I had not the\r\npleasure of receiving the former by the hands of Mr. Lyman. His business\r\nprobably carried him in another direction; for I am far inland, and\r\ndistant from the great line of communication between the trading cities.\r\nYour recommendations are always welcome, for, indeed, the subjects of\r\nthem always merit that welcome, and some of them in an extraordinary\r\ndegree. They make us acquainted with what there is excellent in our\r\nancient sister State of Massachusetts, once venerated and beloved,\r\nand still hanging on our hopes, for what need we despair of after the\r\nresurrection of Connecticut to light and liberality. I had believed that\r\nthe last retreat of monkish darkness, bigotry, and abhorrence of those\r\nadvances of the mind which had carried the other States a century ahead\r\nof them. They seemed still to be exactly where their forefathers were\r\nwhen they schismatized from the covenant of works, and to consider as\r\ndangerous heresies all innovations good or bad. I join you, therefore,\r\nin sincere congratulations that this den of the priesthood is at length\r\nbroken up, and that a Protestant Popedom is no longer to disgrace the\r\nAmerican history and character. If by religion, we are to understand\r\nsectarian dogmas, in which no two of them agree, then your exclamation\r\non that hypothesis is just, ‘that this would be the best of all possible\r\nworlds, if there were no religion in it.’ But if the moral precepts,\r\ninnate in man, and made a part of his physical constitution, as\r\nnecessary for a social being, if the sublime doctrines of philanthropism\r\nand deism taught us by Jesus of Nazareth, in which all agree, constitute\r\ntrue religion, then, without it, this would be, as you again say,\r\n‘something not fit to be named, even indeed, a hell.’\r\n\r\nYou certainly acted wisely in taking no notice of what the malice of\r\nPickering could say of you. Were such things to be answered, our lives\r\nwould be wasted in the filth of fendings and provings, instead of\r\nbeing employed in promoting the happiness and prosperity of our\r\nfellow-citizens. The tenor of your life is the proper and sufficient\r\nanswer. It is fortunate for those in public trust, that posterity will\r\njudge them by their works, and not by the malignant vituperations and\r\ninvectives of the Pickerings and Gardiners of their age. After all, men\r\nof energy of character must have enemies; because there are two sides\r\nto every question, and taking one with decision, and acting on it with\r\neffect, those who take the other will of course be hostile in proportion\r\nas they feel that effect. Thus, in the Revolution, Hancock and the\r\nAdamses were the raw-head and bloody bones of tories and traitors; who\r\nyet knew nothing of you personally but what was good. I do not entertain\r\nyour apprehensions for the happiness of our brother Madison in a state\r\nof retirement. Such a mind as his, fraught with information and with\r\nmatter for reflection, can never know _ennui_. Besides, there will\r\nalways be work enough cut out for him to continue his active usefulness\r\nto his country. For example, he and Monroe (the President) are now\r\nhere on the work of a collegiate institution to be established in our\r\nneighborhood, of which they and myself are three of six Visitors. This,\r\nif it succeeds, will raise up children for Mr. Madison to employ his\r\nattention through life. I say, if it succeeds; for we have two very\r\nessential wants in our way: 1. means to compass our views; and 2. men\r\nqualified to fulfil them. And these you will agree are essential wants\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\nI am glad to find you have a copy of Sismondi, because his is a field\r\nfamiliar to you, and on which you can judge him. His work is highly\r\npraised, but I have not yet read it. I have been occupied and delighted\r\nwith reading another work, the title of which did not promise much\r\nuseful information or amusement, ‘_L’Italia avanti il Dominio del\r\nRomani, dal Micali_. It has often, you know, been a subject of regret\r\nthat Carthage had no writer to give her side of her own history,\r\nwhile her wealth, power, and splendor prove she must have had a very\r\ndistinguished policy and government. Micali has given the counterpart\r\nof the Roman history, for the nations over which they extended their\r\ndominion. For this he has gleaned up matter from every quarter, and\r\nfurnished materials for reflection and digestion to those who, thinking\r\nas they read, have perceived that there was a great deal of matter\r\nbehind the curtain, could that be fully withdrawn. He certainly gives\r\nnew views of a nation whose splendor has masked and palliated their\r\nbarbarous ambition. I am now reading Botta’s History of our own\r\nRevolution. Bating the ancient practice which he has adopted, of putting\r\nspeeches into mouths which never made them, and fancying motives of\r\naction which we never felt, he has given that history with more detail,\r\nprecision, and candor, than any writer I have yet met with. It is, to be\r\nsure, compiled from those writers; but it is a good secretion of their\r\nmatter, the pure from the impure, and presented in a just sense of\r\nright, in opposition to usurpation.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances for Mrs. Adams and yourself of my affectionate esteem\r\nand respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLI.--TO MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE, May 14, 1817\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE.\r\n\r\nMonticello, May 14, 1817.\r\n\r\nAlthough, Dear Sir, much retired from the world, and meddling little in\r\nits concerns, yet I think it almost a religious duty to salute at times\r\nmy old friends, were it only to say and to know that ‘all’s well.’\r\nOur hobby has been politics; but all here is so quiet, and with you so\r\ndesperate, that little matter is furnished us for active attention. With\r\nyou too, it has long been forbidden ground, and therefore imprudent\r\nfor a foreign friend to tread, in writing to you. But although our\r\nspeculations might be intrusive, our prayers cannot but be acceptable,\r\nand mine are sincerely offered for the well-being of France. What\r\ngovernment she can bear, depends not on the state of science, however\r\nexalted, in a select band of enlightened men, but on the condition of\r\nthe general mind. That, I am sure, is advanced and will advance, and\r\nthe last change of government was fortunate, inasmuch as the new will be\r\nless obstructive to the effects of that advancement. For I consider your\r\nforeign military oppression as an ephemeral obstacle only.\r\n\r\nHere all is quiet. The British war has left us in debt; but that is\r\na cheap price for the good it has done us. The establishment of the\r\nnecessary manufactures among ourselves, the proof that our government is\r\nsolid, can stand the shock of war, and is superior even to civil schism,\r\nare precious facts for us; and of these the strongest proofs were\r\nfurnished, when, with four eastern States tied to us, as dead to living\r\nbodies, all doubt was removed as to the achievements of the war, had\r\nit continued. But its best effect has been the complete suppression of\r\nparty. The federalists who were truly American, and their great mass was\r\nso, have separated from their brethren who were mere Anglomen, and are\r\nreceived with cordiality into the republican ranks. Even Connecticut,\r\nas a State, and the last one expected to yield its steady habits (which\r\nwere essentially bigoted in politics as well as religion), has chosen\r\na republican governor, and republican legislature. Massachusetts indeed\r\nstill lags; because most deeply involved in the parricide crimes and\r\ntreasons of the war. But her gangrene is contracting, the sound flesh\r\nadvancing on it, and all there will be well. I mentioned Connecticut\r\nas the most hopeless of our States. Little Delaware had escaped my\r\nattention. That is essentially a Quaker State, the fragment of a\r\nreligious sect which, there, in the other States, in England, are a\r\nhomogeneous mass, acting with one mind, and that directed by the mother\r\nsociety in England. Dispersed, as the Jews, they still form, as those\r\ndo, one nation, foreign to the land they live in. They are Protestant\r\nJesuits, implicitly devoted to the will of their superior, and\r\nforgetting all duties to their country in the execution of the policy\r\nof their order. When war is proposed with England, they have religious\r\nscruples; but when with France, these are laid by, and they become\r\nclamorous for it. They are, however, silent, passive, and give no other\r\ntrouble than of whipping them along. Nor is the election of Monroe an\r\ninefficient circumstance in our felicities. Four and twenty years,\r\nwhich he will accomplish, of administration in republican forms and\r\nprinciples, will so consecrate them in the eyes of the people as\r\nto secure them against the danger of change. The evanition of party\r\ndissensions has harmonized intercourse, and sweetened society beyond\r\nimagination. The war then has done us all this good, and the further one\r\nof assuring the world, that although attached to peace from a sense of\r\nits blessings, we will meet war when it is made necessary.\r\n\r\nI wish I could give better hopes of our southern brethren. The\r\nachievement of their independence of Spain is no longer a question. But\r\nit is a very serious one, what will then become of them. Ignorance and\r\nbigotry, like other insanities, are incapable of self-government. They\r\nwill fall under military despotisms, and become the murderous tools of\r\nthe ambition of their respective Bonapartes; and whether this will be\r\nfor their greater happiness, the rule of one only has taught you to\r\njudge. No one, I hope, can doubt my wish to see them and all mankind\r\nexercising self-government, and capable of exercising it. But the\r\nquestion is not what we wish, but what is practicable. As their sincere\r\nfriend and brother, then, I do believe the best thing for them, would be\r\nfor themselves to come to an accord with Spain, under the guarantee\r\nof France, Russia, Holland, and the United States, allowing to Spain\r\na nominal supremacy, with authority only to keep the peace among them,\r\nleaving them otherwise all the powers of self-government, until\r\ntheir experience in them, their emancipation from their priests,\r\nand advancement in information, shall prepare them for complete\r\nindependence. I exclude England from this confederacy, because her\r\nselfish principles render her incapable of honorable patronage or\r\ndisinterested co-operation: unless, indeed, what seems now probable, a\r\nrevolution, should restore to her an honest government, one which will\r\npermit the world to live in peace. Portugal grasping at an extension\r\nof her dominion in the south, has lost her great northern province of\r\nPernambuco, and I shall not wonder if Brazil should revolt in mass, and\r\nsend their royal family back to Portugal, Brazil is more populous, more\r\nwealthy, more energetic, and as wise as Portugal. I have been insensibly\r\nled, my dear friend, while writing to you, to indulge in that line of\r\nsentiment in which we have been always associated, forgetting that these\r\nare matters not belonging to my time. Not so with you, who have still\r\nmany years to be a spectator of these events. That these years may\r\nindeed be many and happy, is the sincere prayer of your affectionate\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLII.--TO ALBERT GALLATIN, June 16, 1817\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ALBERT GALLATIN.\r\n\r\nMonticello, June 16, 1817.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nThe importance that the enclosed letters should safely reach their\r\ndestination, impels me to avail myself of the protection of your cover.\r\nThis is an inconvenience to which your situation exposes you, while it\r\nadds to the opportunities of exercising yourself in works of charity.\r\n\r\nAccording to the opinion I hazarded to you a little before your\r\ndeparture, we have had almost an entire change in the body of Congress.\r\nThe unpopularity of the compensation law was completed, by the manner of\r\nrepealing it as to all the world except themselves. In some States, it\r\nis said, every member is changed; in all, many. What opposition there\r\nwas to the original law, was chiefly from southern members. Yet many of\r\nthose have been left out, because they received the advanced wages. I\r\nhave never known so unanimous a sentiment of disapprobation; and what\r\nis remarkable, is, that it was spontaneous. The newspapers were almost\r\nentirely silent, and the people not only unled by their leaders, but in\r\nopposition to them. I confess I was highly pleased with this proof\r\nof the innate good sense, the vigilance, and the determination of the\r\npeople to act for themselves.\r\n\r\nAmong the laws of the late Congress, some were of note: a navigation\r\nact, particularly, applicable to those nations only who have navigation\r\nacts; pinching one of them especially, not only in the general way, but\r\nin the intercourse with her foreign possessions. This part may re-act\r\non us, and it remains for trial which may bear longest. A law respecting\r\nour conduct as a neutral between Spain and her contending colonies,\r\nwas passed by a majority of one only, I believe, and against the\r\nvery general sentiment of our country. It is thought to strain our\r\ncomplaisance to Spain beyond her right or merit, and almost against the\r\nright of the other party, and certainly against the claims they have to\r\nour good wishes and neighborly relations. That we should wish to see\r\nthe people of other countries free, is as natural, and at least as\r\njustifiable, as that one King should wish to see the Kings of other\r\ncountries maintained in their despotism. Right to both parties, innocent\r\nfavor to the juster cause, is our proper sentiment.\r\n\r\nYou will have learned that an act for internal improvement, after\r\npassing both houses, was negatived by the President. The act was\r\nfounded, avowedly, on the principle that the phrase in the constitution,\r\nwhich authorizes Congress ‘to lay taxes, to pay the debts and provide\r\nfor the general welfare,’ was an extension of the powers specifically\r\nenumerated to whatever would promote the general welfare; and this,\r\nyou know, was the federal doctrine. Whereas, our tenet ever was,\r\nand, indeed, it is almost the only land-mark which now divides the\r\nfederalists from the republicans, that Congress had not unlimited\r\npowers to provide for the general welfare, but were restrained to those\r\nspecifically enumerated; and that, as it was never meant they should\r\nprovide for that welfare but by the exercise of the enumerated powers,\r\nso it could not have been meant they should raise money for purposes\r\nwhich the enumeration did not place under their action: consequently,\r\nthat the specification of powers is a limitation of the purposes for\r\nwhich they may raise money. I think the passage and rejection of this\r\nbill a fortunate incident. Every State will certainly concede the power;\r\nand this will be a national confirmation of the grounds of appeal to\r\nthem, and will settle for ever the meaning of this phrase, which, by a\r\nmere grammatical quibble, has countenanced the General Government in a\r\nclaim of universal power. For in the phrase, ‘to lay taxes, to pay the\r\ndebts and provide for the general welfare,’ it is a mere question of\r\nsyntax, whether the two last infinitives are governed by the first, or\r\nare distinct and co-ordinate powers; a question unequivocally decided\r\nby the exact definition of powers immediately following. It is fortunate\r\nfor another reason, as the States, in conceding the power, will modify\r\nit, either by requiring the federal ratio of expense in each State, or\r\notherwise, so as to secure us against its partial exercise. Without this\r\ncaution, intrigue, negotiation, and the barter of votes might become as\r\nhabitual in Congress, as they are in those legislatures which have the\r\nappointment of officers, and which, with us, is called ‘logging,’ the\r\nterm of the farmers for their exchanges of aid in rolling together the\r\nlogs of their newly cleared grounds. Three of our papers have presented\r\nus the copy of an act of the legislature of New York, which, if it has\r\nreally passed, will carry us back to the times of the darkest bigotry\r\nand barbarism to find a parallel. Its purport is, that all those who\r\nshall hereafter join in communion with the religious sect of Shaking\r\nQuakers, shall be deemed civilly dead, their marriages dissolved, and\r\nall their children and property taken out of their hands. This act being\r\npublished nakedly in the papers, without the usual signatures, or any\r\nhistory of the circumstances of its passage, I am not without a hope it\r\nmay have been a mere abortive attempt. It contrasts singularly with a\r\ncotemporary vote of the Pennsylvania legislature, who, on a proposition\r\nto make the belief in a God a necessary qualification for office,\r\nrejected it by a great majority, although assuredly there was not a\r\nsingle atheist in their body. And you remember to have heard, that, when\r\nthe act for religious freedom was before the Virginia Assembly, a motion\r\nto insert the name of Jesus Christ before the phrase, ‘the author of our\r\nholy religion,’ which stood in the bill, was rejected, although that was\r\nthe creed of a great majority of them.\r\n\r\nI have been charmed to see that a Presidential election now produces\r\nscarcely any agitation. On Mr. Madison’s election there was little, on\r\nMonroe’s all but none. In Mr. Adams’s time and mine, parties were so\r\nnearly balanced as to make the struggle fearful for our peace. But since\r\nthe decided ascendancy of the republican body, federalism has looked\r\non with silent but unresisting anguish. In the middle, southern, and\r\nwestern States, it is as low as it ever can be; for nature has made some\r\nmen monarchists and tories by their constitution, and some, of course,\r\nthere always will be.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nWe have had a remarkably cold winter. At Hallowell, in Maine, the\r\nmercury was at thirty-four degrees below zero, of Fahrenheit, which is\r\nsixteen degrees lower than it was in Paris in 1788-9. Here it was at six\r\ndegrees above zero, which is our greatest degree of cold.\r\n\r\nPresent me respectfully to Mrs. Gallatin, and be assured of my constant\r\nand affectionate friendship.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLIII.--TO JOHN ADAMS, May 17, 1818\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nMonticello, May 17, 1818.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI was so unfortunate as not to receive from Mr. Holly’s own hand your\r\nfavor of January the 28th, being then at my other home. He dined only\r\nwith my family, and left them with an impression which has filled me\r\nwith regret that I did not partake of the pleasure his visit gave them.\r\nI am glad he is gone to Kentucky. Rational Christianity will thrive more\r\nrapidly there than here. They are freer from prejudices than we are, and\r\nbolder in grasping at truth. The time is not distant, though neither you\r\nnor I shall see it, when we shall be but a secondary people to them. Our\r\ngreediness for wealth, and fantastical expense have degraded, and will\r\ndegrade, the minds of our maritime citizens. These are the peculiar\r\nvices of commerce.\r\n\r\nI had been long without hearing from you, but I had heard of you\r\nthrough a letter from Doctor Waterhouse. He wrote to reclaim against\r\nan expression of Mr. Wirt’s, as to the commencement of motion in\r\nthe revolutionary ball. The lawyers say that words are always to be\r\nexpounded _secundum subjectam materiem_, which, in Mr. Wirt’s case, was\r\nVirginia. It would, moreover, be as difficult to say at what moment\r\nthe Revolution began, and what incident set it in motion, as to fix the\r\nmoment that the embryo becomes an animal, or the act which gives him\r\na beginning. But the most agreeable part of his letter was that which\r\ninformed me of your health, your activity, and strength of memory;\r\nand the most wonderful, that which assured me that you retained your\r\nindustry and promptness in epistolary correspondence. Here you have\r\nentire advantage over me. My repugnance to the writing-table becomes\r\ndaily and hourly more deadly and insurmountable. In place of this has\r\ncome on a canine appetite for reading. And I indulge it, because I see\r\nin it a relief against the _tædium senectutis_; a lamp to lighten my\r\npath through the dreary wilderness of time before me, whose bourne I see\r\nnot. Losing daily all interest in the things around us, something else\r\nis necessary to fill the void. With me it is reading, which occupies the\r\nmind without the labor of producing ideas from my own stock.\r\n\r\nI enter into all your doubts as to the event of the revolution of South\r\nAmerica. They will succeed against Spain. But the dangerous enemy is\r\nwithin their own breasts. Ignorance and superstition will chain their\r\nminds and bodies under religious and military despotism. I do believe it\r\nwould be better for them to obtain freedom by degrees only; because that\r\nwould by degrees bring on light and information, and qualify them to\r\ntake charge of themselves understanding; with more certainty, if, in\r\nthe mean time, under so much control as may keep them at peace with\r\none another. Surely, it is our duty to wish them independence and\r\nself-government, because they wish it themselves, and they have the\r\nright, and we none, to choose for themselves: and I wish, moreover, that\r\nour ideas may be erroneous, and theirs prove well-founded. But these are\r\nspeculations, my friend, which we may as well deliver over to those who\r\nare to see their developement. We shall only be lookers on, from the\r\nclouds above, as now we look down on the labors, the hurry, and bustle\r\nof the ants and bees. Perhaps, in that super-mundane region, we may\r\nbe amused with seeing the fallacy of our own guesses, and even the\r\nnothingness of those labors which have filled and agitated our own time\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n_En attendant_, with sincere affections to Mrs. Adams and yourself, I\r\nsalute you both cordially.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLIV.--TO JOHN ADAMS, November 13, 1818\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nMonticello, November 13, 1818.\r\n\r\nThe public papers, my dear friend, announce the fatal event of which\r\nyour letter of October the 20th had given me ominous foreboding.\r\nTried myself in the school of affliction, by the loss of every form of\r\nconnection which can rive the human heart, I know well, and feel what\r\nyou have lost, what you have suffered, are suffering, and have yet to\r\nendure. The same trials have taught me that, for ills so immeasurable,\r\ntime and silence are the only medicine. I will not, therefore, by\r\nuseless condolences, open afresh the sluices of your grief, nor,\r\nalthough mingling sincerely my tears with yours, will I say a word more\r\nwhere words are vain, but that it is of some comfort to us both, that\r\nthe term is not very distant, at which we are to deposit in the same\r\ncerement our sorrows and suffering bodies, and to ascend in essence to\r\nan ecstatic meeting with the friends we have loved and lost, and whom we\r\nshall still love, and never lose again. God bless you, and support you\r\nunder your heavy affliction.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLV.--TO ROBERT WALSH, December 4, 1818\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ROBERT WALSH.\r\n\r\nMonticello, December 4, 1818.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYours of November the 8th has been some time received; but it is in my\r\npower to give little satisfaction as to its inquiries. Dr. Franklin had\r\nmany political enemies, as every character must, which, with decision\r\nenough to have opinions, has energy and talent to give them effect on\r\nthe feelings of the adversary opinion. These enmities were chiefly in\r\nPennsylvania and Massachusetts. In the former, they were merely of\r\nthe proprietary party. In the latter, they did not commence till the\r\nRevolution, and then sprung chiefly from personal animosities, which,\r\nspreading by little and little, became at length of some extent. Dr.\r\nLee was his principal calumniator, a man of much malignity, who, besides\r\nenlisting his whole family in the same hostility, was enabled, as the\r\nagent of Massachusetts with the British government, to infuse it into\r\nthat State with considerable effect. Mr. Izard, the Doctor’s enemy\r\nalso, but from a pecuniary transaction, never countenanced these charges\r\nagainst him. Mr. Jay, Silas Deane, Mr. Laurens, his colleagues also,\r\never maintained towards him unlimited confidence and respect. That he\r\nwould have waived the formal recognition of our independence, I never\r\nheard on any authority worthy notice. As to the fisheries, England was\r\nurgent to retain them exclusively, France neutral, and I believe, that\r\nhad they been ultimately made a _sine qua non_, our commissioners (Mr.\r\nAdams excepted) would have relinquished them, rather than have broken\r\noff the treaty. To Mr. Adams’s perseverance alone, on that point, I\r\nhave always understood we were indebted for their reservation. As to the\r\ncharge of subservience to France, besides the evidence of his friendly\r\ncolleagues before named, two years of my own service with him at Paris,\r\ndaily visits, and the most friendly and confidential conversations,\r\nconvince me it had not a shadow of foundation. He possessed the\r\nconfidence of that government in the highest degree, insomuch, that\r\nit may truly be said, that they were more under his influence, than\r\nhe under theirs. The fact is, that his temper was so amiable and\r\nconciliatory, his conduct so rational, never urging impossibilities, or\r\neven things unreasonably inconvenient to them, in short, so moderate\r\nand attentive to their difficulties, as well as our own, that what his\r\nenemies called subserviency, I saw was only that reasonable disposition,\r\nwhich, sensible that advantages are not all to be on one side, yielding\r\nwhat is just and liberal, is the more certain of obtaining liberality\r\nand justice. Mutual confidence produces, of course, mutual influence,\r\nand this was all which subsisted between Dr. Franklin and the government\r\nof France.\r\n\r\nI state a few anecdotes of Dr. Franklin, within my own knowledge, too\r\nmuch in detail for the scale of Delaplaine’s work, but which may find a\r\ncadre in some of the more particular views you contemplate. My health is\r\nin a great measure restored, and our family join with me in affectionate\r\nrecollections and assurances of respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLVI.--TO M. DE NEUVILLE, December 13, 1818\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE NEUVILLE.\r\n\r\nMonticello, December 13, 1818.\r\n\r\nI thank your Excellency for the notice with which your letters favor me,\r\nof the liberation of France from the occupation of the allied powers. To\r\nno one, not a native, will it give more pleasure. In the desolation of\r\nEurope, to gratify the atrocious caprices of Bonaparte, France sinned\r\nmuch: but she has suffered more than retaliation. Once relieved from\r\nthe incubus of her late oppression, she will rise like a giant from\r\nher slumbers. Her soil and climate, her arts and eminent science, her\r\ncentral position and free constitution, will soon make her greater than\r\nshe ever was. And I am a false prophet if she does not, at some future\r\nday, remind of her sufferings those who have inflicted them the most\r\neagerly. I hope, however, she will be quiet for the present, and risk\r\nno new troubles. Her constitution, as now amended, gives as much of\r\nself-government as perhaps she can yet bear, and will give more, when\r\nthe habits of order shall have prepared her to receive more. Besides the\r\ngratitude which every American owes her, as our sole ally during the\r\nwar of independence, I am additionally affectioned by the friendships\r\nI contracted there, by the good dispositions I witnessed, and by the\r\ncourtesies I received.\r\n\r\nI rejoice, as a moralist, at the prospect of a reduction of the duties\r\non wine, by our national legislature. It is an error to view a tax on\r\nthat liquor as merely a tax on the rich. It is a prohibition of its use\r\nto the middling class of our citizens, and a condemnation of them to\r\nthe poison of whiskey, which is desolating their houses. No nation is\r\ndrunken where wine is cheap; and none sober, where the dearness of wine\r\nsubstitutes ardent spirits as the common beverage. It is, in truth, the\r\nonly antidote to the bane of whiskey. Fix but the duty at the rate of\r\nother merchandise, and we can drink wine here as cheap as we do grog:\r\nand who will not prefer it? Its extended use will carry health and\r\ncomfort to a much enlarged circle. Every one in easy circumstances (as\r\nthe bulk of our citizens are) will prefer it to the poison to which they\r\nare now driven by their government. And the treasury itself will find\r\nthat a penny a piece from a dozen, is more than a groat from a single\r\none. This reformation, however, will require time. Our merchants know\r\nnothing of the infinite variety of cheap and good wines to be had in\r\nEurope; and particularly in France, in Italy, and the Grecian islands:\r\nas they know little, also, of the variety of excellent manufactures and\r\ncomforts to be had any where out of England. Nor will these things be\r\nknown, nor of course called for here, until the native merchants of\r\nthose countries, to whom they are known, shall bring them forward,\r\nexhibit, and vend them at the moderate profits they can afford. This\r\nalone will procure them familiarity with us, and the preference they\r\nmerit in competition with corresponding articles now in use.\r\n\r\nOur family renew with pleasure their recollections of your kind visit\r\nto Monticello, and join me in tendering sincere assurances of the\r\ngratification it afforded us, and of our great esteem and respectful\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLVII.--TO DOCTOR VINE UTLEY, March 21, 1819\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR VINE UTLEY.\r\n\r\nMonticello, March 21, 1819.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nYour letter of February the 18th came to hand on the 1st instant; and\r\nthe request of the history of my physical habits would have puzzled me\r\nnot a little, had it not been for the model with which you accompanied\r\nit, of Doctor Rush’s answer to a similar inquiry. I live so much like\r\nother people, that I might refer to ordinary life as the history of my\r\nown. Like my friend the Doctor, I have lived temperately, eating little\r\nanimal food, and that not as an aliment, so much as a condiment for the\r\nvegetables, which constitute my principal diet. I double, however, the\r\nDoctor’s glass and a half of wine, and even treble it with a friend;\r\nbut halve its effect by drinking the weak wines only. The ardent wines I\r\ncannot drink, nor do I use ardent spirits in any form. Malt liquors\r\nand cider are my table drinks, and my breakfast, like that also of\r\nmy friend, is of tea and coffee. I have been blest with organs of\r\ndigestion, which accept and concoct, without ever murmuring, whatever\r\nthe palate chooses to consign to them, and I have not yet lost a tooth\r\nby age. I was a hard student until I entered on the business of life,\r\nthe duties of which leave no idle time to those disposed to fulfil\r\nthem; and now, retired, and at the age of seventy-six, I am again a hard\r\nstudent. Indeed my fondness for reading and study revolts me from the\r\ndrudgery of letter-writing. And a stiff wrist, the consequence of an\r\nearly dislocation, makes writing both slow and painful. I am not so\r\nregular in my sleep as the Doctor says he was, devoting to it from\r\nfive to eight hours, according as my company or the book I am reading\r\ninterests me; and I never go to bed without an hour, or half hour’s\r\nprevious reading of something moral, whereon to ruminate in the\r\nintervals of sleep. But whether I retire to bed early or late, I rise\r\nwith the sun. I use spectacles at night, but not necessarily in the\r\nday, unless in reading small print. My hearing is distinct in particular\r\nconversation, but confused when several voices cross each other, which\r\nunfits me for the society of the table. I have been more fortunate than\r\nmy friend in the article of health. So free from catarrhs that I have\r\nnot had one (in the breast, I mean) on an average of eight or ten years\r\nthrough life. I ascribe this exemption partly to the habit of bathing my\r\nfeet in cold water every morning for sixty years past. A fever of more\r\nthan twenty-four hours I have not had above two or three times in my\r\nlife. A periodical headache has afflicted me occasionally, once, perhaps,\r\nin six or eight years, for two or three weeks at a time, which seems\r\nnow to have left me; and, except on a late occasion of indisposition, I\r\nenjoy good health; too feeble, indeed, to walk much, but riding without\r\nfatigue six or eight miles a day, and sometimes thirty or forty. I may\r\nend these egotisms, therefore, as I began, by saying that my life has\r\nbeen so much like that of other people, that I might say with Horace,\r\nto every one, ‘_Nomine mutato, narratur fabula de te_.’ I must not end,\r\nhowever, without due thanks for the kind sentiments of regard you are\r\nso good as to express towards myself; and with my acknowledgments for\r\nthese, be pleased to accept the assurances of my respect and esteem.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLVIII.--TO JOHN ADAMS, July 9, 1819\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nMonticello, July 9, 1819.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI am in debt to you for your letters of May the 21st, 27th, and June\r\nthe 22nd. The first, delivered me by Mr. Greenwood, gave me the\r\ngratification of his acquaintance; and a gratification it always is, to\r\nbe made acquainted with gentlemen of candor, worth, and information, as\r\nI found Mr. Greenwood to be. That, on the subject of Mr. Samuel Adams\r\nWells, shall not be forgotten in time and place, when it can be used to\r\nhis advantage.\r\n\r\nBut what has attracted my peculiar notice, is the paper from Mecklenburg\r\ncounty, of North Carolina, published in the Essex Register, which you\r\nwere so kind as to enclose in your last, of June the 22nd. And you\r\nseem to think it genuine. I believe it spurious. I deem it to be a very\r\nunjustifiable quiz, like that of the volcano, so minutely related to us\r\nas having broken out in North Carolina, some half dozen years ago,\r\nin that part of the country, and perhaps in that very county of\r\nMecklenburg, for I do not remember its precise locality. If this paper\r\nbe really taken from the Raleigh Register, as quoted, I wonder it should\r\nhave escaped Ritchie, who culls what is good from every paper, as the\r\nbee from every flower; and the National Intelligencer, too, which is\r\nedited by a North-Carolinian: and that the fire should blaze out all at\r\nonce in Essex, one thousand miles from where the spark is said to\r\nhave fallen. But if really taken from the Raleigh Register, who is the\r\nnarrator, and is the name subscribed real, or is it as fictitious as the\r\npaper itself? It appeals, too, to an original book, which is burnt, to\r\nMr. Alexander, who is dead, to a joint letter from Caswell, Hughes, and\r\nHooper, all dead, to a copy sent to the dead Caswell, and another sent\r\nto Doctor Williamson, now probably dead, whose memory did not recollect,\r\nin the history he has written of North Carolina, this gigantic step\r\nof its county of Mecklenburg. Horry, too, is silent in his history of\r\nMarion, whose scene of action was the country bordering On Mecklenburg.\r\nRamsay, Marshall, Jones, Girardin, Wirt, historians of the adjacent\r\nStates, all silent. When Mr. Henry’s resolutions, far short of\r\nindependence, flew like lightning through every paper, and kindled both\r\nsides of the Atlantic, this flaming declaration of the same date, of the\r\nindependence of Mecklenburg county, of North Carolina, absolving it from\r\nthe British allegiance, and abjuring all political connection with that\r\nnation, although sent to Congress, too, is never heard of. It is not\r\nknown even a twelvemonth after, when a similar proposition is first made\r\nin that body. Armed with this bold example, would not you have addressed\r\nour timid brethren in peals of thunder, on their tardy fears? Would\r\nnot every advocate of independence have rung the glories of Mecklenburg\r\ncounty, in North Carolina, in the ears of the doubting Dickinson and\r\nothers, who hung so heavily on us? Yet the example of independent\r\nMecklenburg county, in North Carolina, was never once quoted. The paper\r\nspeaks, too, of the continued exertions of their delegation (Caswell,\r\nHooper, Hughes,) ‘in the cause of liberty and independence.’ Now, you\r\nremember as well as I do, that we had not a greater tory in Congress\r\nthan Hooper; that Hughes was very wavering, sometimes firm, sometimes\r\nfeeble, according as the day was clear or cloudy; that Caswell, indeed,\r\nwas a good whig, and kept these gentlemen to the notch, while he was\r\npresent; but that he left us soon, and their line of conduct became then\r\nuncertain until Penn came, who fixed Hughes, and the vote of the State.\r\nI must not be understood as suggesting any doubtfulness in the State\r\nof North Carolina. No State was more fixed or forward. Nor do I affirm,\r\npositively, that this paper is a fabrication: because the proof of a\r\nnegative can only be presumptive. But I shall believe it such until\r\npositive and solemn proof of its authenticity shall be produced. And if\r\nthe name of McKnitt be real, and not a part of the fabrication, it needs\r\na vindication by the production of such proof. For the present, I must\r\nbe an unbeliever in the apocryphal gospel.\r\n\r\nI am glad to learn that Mr. Ticknor has safely returned to his friends;\r\nbut should have been much more pleased had he accepted the Professorship\r\nin our University, which we should have offered him in form. Mr.\r\nBowditch, too, refuses us; so fascinating is the _vinculum_ of the\r\n_dulce natale solum_. Our wish is to procure natives, where they can be\r\nfound, like these gentlemen, of the first order of acquirement in\r\ntheir respective lines; but preferring foreigners of the first order to\r\nnatives of the second, we shall certainly have to go, for several of our\r\nProfessors, to countries more advanced in science than we are.\r\n\r\nI set out within three or four days for my other home, the distance\r\nof which, and its cross mails, are great impediments to epistolary\r\ncommunications. I shall remain there about two months; and there,\r\nhere, and every where, I am and shall always be, affectionately and\r\nrespectfully yours.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLIX.--TO JUDGE ROANE, September 6,1819\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JUDGE ROANE.\r\n\r\nPoplar Forest, September 6,1819.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI had read in the Enquirer, and with great approbation, the pieces\r\nsigned Hampden, and have read them again with redoubled approbation in\r\nthe copies you have been so kind as to send me. I subscribe to every\r\ntittle of them. They contain the true principles of the revolution\r\nof 1800, for that was as real a revolution in the principles of our\r\ngovernment as that of 1776 was in its form; not effected indeed by the\r\nsword, as that, but by the rational and peaceable instrument of reform,\r\nthe suffrage of the people. The nation declared its will by dismissing\r\nfunctionaries of one principle, and electing those of another, in the\r\ntwo branches, executive and legislative, submitted to their election.\r\nOver the judiciary department, the constitution had deprived them of\r\ntheir control. That, therefore, has continued the reprobated system: and\r\nalthough new matter has been occasionally incorporated into the old, yet\r\nthe leaven of the old mass seems to assimilate to itself the new; and\r\nafter twenty years’ confirmation of the federated system by the voice\r\nof the nation, declared through the medium of elections, we find the\r\njudiciary, on every occasion, still driving us into consolidation.\r\n\r\nIn denying the right they usurp of exclusively explaining the\r\nconstitution, I go further than you do, if I understand rightly your\r\nquotation from the Federalist, of an opinion that ‘the judiciary is the\r\nlast resort in relation _to the other departments of the government_,\r\nbut not in relation to the rights of the parties to the compact under\r\nwhich the judiciary is derived.’ If this opinion be sound, then indeed\r\nis our constitution a complete _felo de se_. For intending to establish\r\nthree departments, co-ordinate and independent, that they might check\r\nand balance one another, it has given, according to this opinion, to one\r\nof them alone, the right to prescribe rules for the government of the\r\nothers, and to that one too, which is unelected by, and independent of\r\nthe nation. For experience has already shown that the impeachment it\r\nhas provided is not even a scare-crow; that such opinions as the one\r\nyou combat, sent cautiously out, as you observe also, by detachment, not\r\nbelonging to the case often, but sought for out of it, as if to rally\r\nthe public opinion beforehand to their views, and to indicate the line\r\nthey are to walk in, have been so quietly passed over as never to have\r\nexcited animadversion, even in a speech of any one of the body entrusted\r\nwith impeachment. The constitution, on this hypothesis, is a mere thing\r\nof wax in the hands of the judiciary, which they may twist and shape\r\ninto any form they please. It should be remembered, as an axiom of\r\neternal truth in politics, that whatever power in any government is\r\nindependent, is absolute also; in theory only, at first, while the\r\nspirit of the people is up, but in practice, as fast as that relaxes.\r\nIndependence can be trusted no where but with the people in mass. They\r\nare inherently independent of all but moral law. My construction of\r\nthe constitution is very different from that you quote. It is that each\r\ndepartment is truly independent of the others, and has an equal right to\r\ndecide for itself what is the meaning of the constitution in the cases\r\nsubmitted to its action; and especially, where it is to act ultimately\r\nand without appeal. I will explain myself by examples, which, having\r\noccurred while I was in office, are better known to me, and the\r\nprinciples which governed them.\r\n\r\nA legislature had passed the sedition-law. The federal courts\r\nhad subjected certain individuals to its penalties, of fine and\r\nimprisonment. On coming into office, I released these individuals by the\r\npower of pardon committed to executive discretion, which could never be\r\nmore properly exercised than where citizens were suffering without the\r\nauthority of law, or, which was equivalent, under a law unauthorized\r\nby the constitution, and therefore null. In the case of Marbury and\r\nMadison, the federal judges declared that commissions, signed and sealed\r\nby the President, were valid, although not delivered. I deemed delivery\r\nessential to complete a deed, which, as long as it remains in the hands\r\nof the party, is as yet no deed, it is in posse only, but not in\r\nesse, and I withheld delivery of the commissions. They cannot issue a\r\nmandamus* to the President or legislature, or to any of their officers.\r\nWhen the British treaty of 180- arrived, without any provision against\r\nthe impressment of our seamen, I determined not to ratify it. The Senate\r\nthought I should ask their advice. I thought that would be a mockery of\r\nthem, when I was predetermined against following it, should they advise\r\nits ratification. The constitution had made their advice necessary to\r\nconfirm a treaty, but not to reject it. This has been blamed by some;\r\nbut I have never doubted its soundness. In the cases of two persons,\r\nantenati, under exactly similar circumstances, the federal court had\r\ndetermined that one of them (Duane) was not a citizen; the House of\r\nRepresentatives nevertheless determined that the other (Smith of South\r\nCarolina) was a citizen, and admitted him to his seat in their body.\r\nDuane was a republican, and Smith a federalist, and these decisions were\r\nduring the federal ascendancy.\r\n\r\n     * The constitution controlling the common law in this\r\n     particular.\r\n\r\nThese are examples of my position, that each of the three departments\r\nhas equally the right to decide for itself what is its duty under the\r\nconstitution, without any regard to what the others may have decided\r\nfor themselves under a similar question. But you intimate a wish that my\r\nopinion should be known on this subject. No, dear Sir, I withdraw\r\nfrom all contests of opinion, and resign every thing cheerfully to\r\nthe generation now in place. They are wiser than we were, and their\r\nsuccessors will be wiser than they, from the progressive advance of\r\nscience. Tranquillity is the _summum bonum_ of age. I wish, therefore,\r\nto offend no man’s opinions, nor to draw disquieting animadversions\r\non my own. While duty required it, I met opposition with a firm and\r\nfearless step. But, loving mankind in my individual relations with\r\nthem, I pray to be permitted to depart in their peace; and like the\r\nsuperannuated soldier, ‘_quadragenis stipendiis emeritis_’ to hang my\r\narms on the post. I have unwisely, I fear, embarked in an enterprise of\r\ngreat public concern, but not to be accomplished within my term, without\r\ntheir liberal and prompt support. A severe illness the last year and\r\nanother from which I am just emerged, admonish me that repetitions may\r\nbe expected, against which a declining frame cannot long bear up. I am\r\nanxious therefore to get our University so far advanced as may encourage\r\nthe public to persevere to its final accomplishment. That secured, I\r\nshall sing my _Nunc demittas_. I hope your labors will be long continued\r\nin the spirit in which they have always been exercised, in maintenance\r\nof those principles on which I verily believe the future happiness of\r\nour country essentially depends. I salute you with affectionate and\r\ngreat respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CL.--TO JOHN ADAMS, December 10, 1819\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nMonticello, December 10, 1819.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of November the 23rd.\r\nThe banks, bankrupt-law, manufacturers, Spanish treaty, are nothing.\r\nThese are occurrences which, like waves in a storm, will pass under\r\nthe ship. But the Missouri question is a breaker on which we lose the\r\nMissouri country by revolt, and what more, God only knows. From the\r\nbattle of Bunker’s Hill to the treaty of Paris, we never had so ominous\r\na question. It even damps the joy with which I hear of your high health,\r\nand welcomes to me the consequences of my want of it. I thank God that I\r\nshall not live to witness its issue. _Sed hæc hactenus_.\r\n\r\nI have been amusing myself latterly with reading the voluminous letters\r\nof Cicero. They certainly breathe the purest effusions of an exalted\r\npatriot, while the parricide Caesar is lost in odious contrast. When the\r\nenthusiasm, however, kindled by Cicero’s pen and principles, subsides\r\ninto cool reflection, I ask myself, What was that government which the\r\nvirtues of Cicero were so zealous to restore, and the ambition of Caesar\r\nto subvert? And if Caesar had been as virtuous as he was daring and\r\nsagacious, what could he, even in the plenitude of his usurped power,\r\nhave done to lead his fellow-citizens into good government? I do not say\r\nto restore it, because they never had it, from the rape of the Sabines\r\nto the ravages of the Caesars. If their people indeed had been, like\r\nourselves, enlightened, peaceable, and really free, the answer would be\r\nobvious. ‘Restore independence to all your foreign conquests, relieve\r\nItaly from the government of the rabble of Rome, consult it as a\r\nnation entitled to self-government, and do its will.’ But steeped in\r\ncorruption, vice, and venality, as the whole nation was, (and nobody\r\nhad done more than Caesar to corrupt it,) what could even Cicero, Cato,\r\nBrutus, have done, had it been referred to them to establish a\r\ngood government for their country? They had no ideas of government\r\nthemselves, but of their degenerate Senate, nor the people of liberty,\r\nbut of the factious opposition of their tribunes. They had afterwards\r\ntheir Tituses, their Trajans, and Antoninuses, who had the will to make\r\nthem happy, and the power to mould their government into a good and\r\npermanent form. But it would seem as if they could not see their way\r\nclearly to do it. No government can continue good, but under the control\r\nof the people; and their people were so demoralized and depraved, as to\r\nbe incapable of exercising a wholesome control. Their reformation then\r\nwas to be taken up _ab incunabulis_. Their minds were to be informed by\r\neducation what is right and what wrong; to be encouraged in habits of\r\nvirtue, and deterred from those of vice, by the dread of punishments,\r\nproportioned indeed, but irremissible; in all cases, to follow truth\r\nas the only safe guide, and to eschew error, which bewilders us in one\r\nfalse consequence after another, in endless succession. These are\r\nthe inculcations necessary to render the people a sure basis for the\r\nstructure of order and good government. But this would have been an\r\noperation of a generation or two, at least, within which period would\r\nhave succeeded many Neros and Commoduses, who would have quashed the\r\nwhole process. I confess then, I can neither see what Cicero, Cato, and\r\nBrutus, united and uncontrolled, could have devised to lead their people\r\ninto good government, nor how this enigma can be solved, nor how further\r\nshown why it has been the fate of that delightful country never to have\r\nknown, to this day, and through a course of five and twenty hundred\r\nyears, the history of which we possess, one single day of free and\r\nrational government. Your intimacy with their history, ancient, middle,\r\nand modern, your familiarity with the improvements in the science of\r\ngovernment at this time, will enable you, if any body, to go back with\r\nour principles and opinions to the limes of Cicero, Cato, and Brutus,\r\nand tell us by what process these great and virtuous men could have led\r\nso unenlightened and vitiated a people into freedom and good government,\r\n_et eris mihi magnus Apollo. Cura ut valeas, et tibi persuadeas\r\ncarissimum te mihi esse_.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLI.--TO WILLIAM SHORT, April 13, 1820\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\nMonticello, April 13, 1820.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of March the 27th is received, and, as you request, a copy of\r\nthe syllabus is now enclosed. It was originally written to Dr. Rush. On\r\nhis death, fearing that the inquisition of the public might get hold of\r\nit, I asked the return of it from the family, which they kindly complied\r\nwith. At the request of another friend, I had given him a copy. He lent\r\nit to his friend to read, who copied it, and in a few months it appeared\r\nin the Theological Magazine of London. Happily that repository is\r\nscarcely known in this country; and the syllabus, therefore, is still a\r\nsecret, and in your hands I am sure it will continue so.\r\n\r\nBut while this syllabus is meant to place the character of Jesus in its\r\ntrue and high light, as no impostor himself, but a great reformer of the\r\nHebrew code of religion, it is not to be understood that I am with\r\nhim in all his doctrines. I am a Materialist; he takes the side of\r\nSpiritualism: he preaches the efficacy of repentance towards forgiveness\r\nof sin; I require a counterpoise of good works to redeem it, &c. &c. It\r\nis the innocence of his character, the purity and sublimity of his moral\r\nprecepts, the eloquence of his inculcations, the beauty of the apologues\r\nin which he conveys them, that I so much admire; sometimes, indeed,\r\nneeding indulgence to eastern hyperbolism. My eulogies, too, may be\r\nfounded on a postulate which all may not be ready to grant. Among the\r\nsayings and discourses imputed to him by his biographers, I find many\r\npassages of fine imagination, correct morality, and of the most lovely\r\nbenevolence; and others again, of so much ignorance, so much absurdity,\r\nso much untruth, charlatanism, and imposture, as to pronounce it\r\nimpossible that such contradictions should have proceeded from the same\r\nbeing. I separate, therefore, the gold from the dross; restore to him\r\nthe former, and leave the latter to the stupidity of some, and roguery\r\nof others of his disciples. Of this band of dupes and impostors, Paul\r\nwas the great Coryphæus, and first corrupter of the doctrines of Jesus.\r\nThese palpable interpolations and falsifications of his doctrines led me\r\nto try to sift them apart. I found the work obvious and easy, and that\r\nhis part composed the most beautiful morsel of morality which has been\r\ngiven to us by man. The syllabus is therefore of his doctrine, not\r\nall of mine: I read them as I do those of other ancient and modern\r\nmoralists, with a mixture of approbation and dissent.\r\n\r\nI rejoice, with you, to see an encouraging spirit of internal\r\nimprovement prevailing in the States. The opinion I have ever expressed\r\nof the advantages of a western communication through the James River, I\r\nstill entertain; and that the Cayuga is the most promising of the links\r\nof communication.\r\n\r\nThe history of our University you know so far. Seven of the ten\r\npavilions destined for the Professors, and about thirty dormitories,\r\nwill be completed this year, and three others, with six hotels for\r\nboarding, and seventy other dormitories, will be completed the next\r\nyear, and the whole be in readiness then to receive those who are to\r\noccupy them. But means to bring these into place, and to set the machine\r\ninto motion, must come from the legislature. An opposition, in the mean\r\ntime, has been got up. That of our alma mater, William and Mary, is not\r\nof much weight. She must descend into the secondary rank of academies of\r\npreparation for the University. The serious enemies are the priests of\r\nthe different religious sects, to whose spells on the human mind\r\nits improvement is ominous. Their pulpits are now resounding with\r\ndenunciations against the appointment of Doctor Cooper, whom they charge\r\nas a monotheist in opposition to their tritheism. Hostile as these sects\r\nare, in every other point, to one another, they unite in maintaining\r\ntheir mystical theogony against those who believe there is one God only.\r\nThe Presbyterian clergy are loudest; the most intolerant of all sects,\r\nthe most tyrannical and ambitious; ready at the word of the lawgiver, if\r\nsuch a word could be now obtained, to put the torch to the pile, and\r\nto rekindle in this virgin hemisphere the flames in which their oracle\r\nCalvin consumed the poor Servetus, because, he could not find in his\r\nEuclid the proposition which has demonstrated that three are one, and\r\none is three, nor subscribe to that of Calvin, that magistrates have\r\na right to exterminate all heretics to Calvinistic creed. They pant to\r\nre-establish, by law, that holy inquisition, which they can now only\r\ninfuse into public opinion. We have most unwisely committed to the\r\nhierophants of our particular superstition the direction of public\r\nopinion, that lord of the universe. We have given them stated and\r\nprivileged days to collect and catechize us, opportunities of delivering\r\ntheir oracles to the people in mass, and of moulding their minds as\r\nwax in the hollow of their hands. But in despite of their fulminations\r\nagainst endeavors to enlighten the general mind, to improve the reason\r\nof the people, and encourage them in the use of it, the liberality of\r\nthis State will support this institution, and give fair play to the\r\ncultivation of reason. Can you ever find a more eligible occasion of\r\nvisiting once more your native country, than that of accompanying Mr.\r\nCorrea, and of seeing with him this beautiful and hopeful institution\r\n_in ovo_.\r\n\r\nAlthough I had laid down as a law to myself, never to write, talk, or\r\neven think of politics, to know nothing of public affairs, and therefore\r\nhad ceased to read newspapers, yet the Missouri question aroused\r\nand filled me with alarm. The old schism of federal and republican\r\nthreatened nothing, because it existed in every State, and united them\r\ntogether by the fraternism of party. But the coincidence of a marked\r\nprinciple, moral and political, with a geographical line, once\r\nconceived, I feared would never more be obliterated from the mind; that\r\nit would be recurring on every occasion, and renewing irritations, until\r\nit would kindle such mutual and mortal hatred, as to render separation\r\npreferable to eternal discord. I have been among the most sanguine in\r\nbelieving that our Union would be of long duration. I now doubt it much,\r\nand see the event at no great distance, and the direct consequence of\r\nthis question: not by the line which has been so confidently counted on;\r\nthe laws of nature control this; but by the Potomac, Ohio, and Missouri,\r\nor more probably, the Mississippi upwards to our northern boundary. My\r\nonly comfort and confidence is, that I shall not live to see this; and I\r\nenvy not the present generation the glory of throwing away the fruits of\r\ntheir fathers’ sacrifices of life and fortune, and of rendering desperate\r\nthe experiment which was to decide ultimately whether man is capable of\r\nself-government. This treason against human hope will signalize their\r\nepoch in future history, as the counterpart of the medal of their\r\npredecessors.\r\n\r\nYou kindly inquire after my health. There is nothing in it immediately\r\nthreatening, but swelled legs, which are kept down mechanically, by\r\nbandages from the toe to the knee. These I have worn for six months. But\r\nthe tendency to turgidity may proceed from debility alone. I can walk\r\nthe round of my garden; not more. But I ride six or eight miles a day\r\nwithout fatigue. I shall set out for Poplar Forest within three or four\r\ndays; a journey from which my physician augurs much good.\r\n\r\nI salute you with constant and affectionate friendship and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLII.--TO JOHN HOLMES, April 22, 1820\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN HOLMES.\r\n\r\nMonticello, April 22, 1820.\r\n\r\nI thank you, dear Sir, for the copy you have been so kind as to send\r\nme of the letter to your constituents on the Missouri question. It is\r\na perfect justification to them. I had for a long time ceased to read\r\nnewspapers, or pay any attention to public affairs, confident they were\r\nin good hands, and content to be a passenger in our bark to the shore\r\nfrom which I am not distant. But this momentous question, like a\r\nfire-bell in the night, awakened and filled me with terror. I considered\r\nit at once as the knell of the Union. It is hushed, indeed, for\r\nthe moment. But this is a reprieve only, not a final sentence. A\r\ngeographical line, coinciding with a marked principle, moral and\r\npolitical, once conceived and held up to the angry passions of men, will\r\nnever be obliterated; and every new irritation will mark it deeper and\r\ndeeper. I can say, with conscious truth, that there is not a man on\r\nearth who would sacrifice more than I would to relieve us from this\r\nheavy reproach, in any practicable way. The cession of that kind of\r\nproperty (for so it is misnamed) is a bagatelle which would not cost\r\nme a second thought, if, in that way, a general emancipation and\r\nexpatriation could be effected: and, gradually, and with due sacrifices,\r\nI think it might be. But as it is, we have the wolf by the ears, and we\r\ncan neither hold him, nor safely let him go. Justice is in one scale,\r\nand self-preservation in the other. Of one thing I am certain, that as\r\nthe passage of slaves from one State to another, would not make a\r\nslave of a single human being who would not be so without it, so their\r\ndiffusion over a greater surface would make them individually happier,\r\nand proportionally facilitate the accomplishment of their emancipation,\r\nby dividing the burthen on a greater number of coadjutors. An\r\nabstinence, too, from this act of power, would remove the jealousy\r\nexcited by the undertaking of Congress to regulate the condition of the\r\ndifferent descriptions of men composing a State. This certainly is the\r\nexclusive right of every State, which nothing in the constitution has\r\ntaken from them, and given to the General Government. Could Congress,\r\nfor example, say, that the non-freemen of Connecticut shall be freemen,\r\nor that they shall not emigrate into any other State?\r\n\r\nI regret that I am now to die in the belief, that the useless sacrifice\r\nof themselves by the generation of 1776, to acquire self-government\r\nand happiness to their country, is to be thrown away by the unwise and\r\nunworthy passions of their sons, and that my only consolation is to be,\r\nthat I live not to weep over it. If they would but dispassionately weigh\r\nthe blessings they will throw away, against an abstract principle more\r\nlikely to be effected by union than by scission, they would pause before\r\nthey would perpetrate this act of suicide on themselves, and of treason\r\nagainst the hopes of the world. To yourself, as the faithful advocate of\r\nthe Union, I tender the offering of my high esteem and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLIII.--TO WILLIAM SHORT, August 4, 1820\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\nMonticello, August 4, 1820.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI owe you a letter for your favor of June the 29th, which was received\r\nin due time; and there being no subject of the day, of particular\r\ninterest, I will make this a supplement to mine of April the 13th. My\r\naim in that was, to justify the character of Jesus against the fictions\r\nof his pseudo-followers, which have exposed him to the inference of\r\nbeing an impostor. For if we could believe that he really countenanced\r\nthe follies, the falsehoods, and the charlatanisms which his biographers\r\nfather on him, and admit the misconstructions, interpolations, and\r\ntheorizations of the fathers of the early, and fanatics of the latter\r\nages, the conclusion would be irresistible by every sound mind, that he\r\nwas an impostor. I give no credit to their falsifications of his actions\r\nand doctrines, and to rescue his character, the postulate in my letter\r\nasked only what is granted in reading every other historian. When\r\nLivy and Siculus, for example, tell us things which coincide with our\r\nexperience of the order of nature, we credit them on their word, and\r\nplace their narrations among the records of credible history. But when\r\nthey tell us of calves speaking, of statues sweating blood, and other\r\nthings against the course of nature, we reject these as fables not\r\nbelonging to history. In like manner, when an historian, speaking of a\r\ncharacter well known and established on satisfactory testimony, imputes\r\nto it things incompatible with that character, we reject them without\r\nhesitation, and assent to that only of which we have better evidence.\r\nHad Plutarch informed us that Cæsar and Cicero passed their whole lives\r\nin religious exercises, and abstinence from the affairs of the world,\r\nwe should reject what was so inconsistent with their established\r\ncharacters, still crediting what he relates in conformity with our ideas\r\nof them. So again, the superlative wisdom of Socrates is testified\r\nby all antiquity, and placed on ground not to be questioned. When,\r\ntherefore, Plato puts into his mouth such paralogisms, such quibbles on\r\nwords, and sophisms, as a school-boy would be ashamed of, we conclude\r\nthey were the whimsies of Plato’s own foggy brain, and acquit Socrates\r\nof puerilities so unlike his character. (Speaking of Plato, I will add,\r\nthat no writer, ancient or modern, has bewildered the world with more\r\n_ignes fatui_, than this renowned philosopher, in Ethics, in Politics,\r\nand Physics. In the latter, to specify a single example, compare his\r\nviews of the animal economy, in his Timasus, with those of Mrs. Bryan in\r\nher Conversations on Chemistry, and weigh the science of the canonized\r\nphilosopher against the good sense of the unassuming lady. But Plato’s\r\nvisions have furnished a basis for endless systems of mystical theology,\r\nand he is therefore all but adopted as a Christian saint. It is surely\r\ntime for men to think for themselves, and to throw off the authority of\r\nnames so artificially magnified. But to return from this parenthesis.) I\r\nsay, that this free exercise of reason is all I ask for the vindication\r\nof the character of Jesus. We find in the writings of his biographers\r\nmatter of two distinct descriptions. First, a ground-work of vulgar\r\nignorance, of things impossible, of superstitions, fanaticisms, and\r\nfabrications. Intermixed with these, again, are sublime ideas of the\r\nSupreme Being, aphorisms, and precepts of the purest morality and\r\nbenevolence, sanctioned by a life of humility, innocence, and simplicity\r\nof manners, neglect of riches, absence of worldly ambition and honors,\r\nwith an eloquence and persuasiveness which have not been surpassed.\r\nThese could not be inventions of the grovelling authors who relate them.\r\nThey are far beyond the powers of their feeble minds. They show that\r\nthere was a character, the subject of their history, whose splendid\r\nconceptions were above all suspicion of being interpolations from their\r\nhands. Can we be at a loss in separating such materials, and ascribing\r\neach to its genuine author? The difference is obvious to the eye and\r\nto the understanding, and we may read as we run to each his part; and I\r\nwill venture to affirm, that he who, as I have done, will undertake to\r\nwinnow this grain from its chaff, will find it not to require a moment’s\r\nconsideration. The parts fall asunder of themselves, as would those of\r\nan image of metal and clay.\r\n\r\nThere are, I acknowledge, passages not free from objection, which we\r\nmay, with probability, ascribe to Jesus himself; but claiming indulgence\r\nfrom the circumstances under which he acted. His object was the\r\nreformation of some articles in the religion of the Jews, as taught by\r\nMoses. That sect had presented for the object of their worship, a being\r\nof terrific character, cruel, vindictive, capricious, and unjust. Jesus,\r\ntaking for his type the best qualities of the human head and heart,\r\nwisdom, justice, goodness, and adding to them power, ascribed all of\r\nthese, but in infinite perfection, to the Supreme Being, and formed him\r\nreally worthy of their adoration. Moses had either not believed in\r\na future state of existence, or had not thought it essential to be\r\nexplicitly taught to his people. Jesus inculcated that doctrine\r\nwith emphasis and precision. Moses had bound the Jews to many idle\r\nceremonies, mummeries, and observances, of no effect towards producing\r\nthe social utilities which constitute the essence of virtue; Jesus\r\nexposed their futility and insignificance. The one instilled into his\r\npeople the most anti-social spirit towards other nations; the other\r\npreached philanthropy and universal charity and benevolence. The office\r\nof reformer of the superstitions of a nation, is ever dangerous. Jesus\r\nhad to walk on the perilous confines of reason and religion: and a step\r\nto right or left might place him within the gripe of the priests of\r\nthe superstition, a blood-thirsty race, as cruel and remorseless as the\r\nbeing whom they represented as the family God of Abraham, of Isaac,\r\nand of Jacob, and the local God of Israel. They were constantly laying\r\nsnares, too, to entangle him in the web of the law. He was\r\njustifiable, therefore, in avoiding these by evasions, by sophisms, by\r\nmisconstructions, and misapplications of scraps of the prophets, and\r\nin defending himself with these their own weapons, as sufficient, _ad\r\nhomines_, at least. That Jesus did not mean to impose himself on mankind\r\nas the Son of God, physically speaking, I have been convinced by the\r\nwritings of men more learned than myself in that lore. But that he might\r\nconscientiously believe himself inspired from above, is very possible.\r\nThe whole religion of the Jews, inculcated on him from his infancy,\r\nwas founded in the belief of divine inspiration. The fumes of the\r\nmost disordered imaginations were recorded in their religious code,\r\nas special communications of the Deity; and as it could not but happen\r\nthat, in the course of ages events would now and then turn up to which\r\nsome of these vague rhapsodies might be accommodated by the aid of\r\nallegories, figures, types, and other tricks upon words, they have not\r\nonly preserved their credit with the Jews of all subsequent times,\r\nbut are the foundation of much of the religions of those who have\r\nschismatized from them. Elevated by the enthusiasm of a warm and pure\r\nheart, conscious of the high strains of an eloquence which had not been\r\ntaught him, he might readily mistake the coruscations of his own fine\r\ngenius for inspirations of an higher order. This belief, carried,\r\ntherefore, no more personal imputation, than the belief of Socrates,\r\nthat himself was under the care and admonitions of a guardian Daemon.\r\nAnd how many of our wisest men still believe in the reality of these\r\ninspirations, while perfectly sane on all other subjects. Excusing,\r\ntherefore, on these considerations, those passages in the gospels which\r\nseem to bear marks of weakness in Jesus, ascribing to him what alone is\r\nconsistent with the great and pure character of which the same writings\r\nfurnish proofs, and to their proper authors their own trivialities\r\nand imbecilities, I think myself authorized to conclude the purity and\r\ndistinction of his character, in opposition to the impostures which\r\nthose authors would fix upon him; and that the postulate of my former\r\nletter is no more than is granted in all other historical works.\r\n\r\nMr. Correa is here, on his farewell visit to us. He has been much\r\npleased with the plan and progress of our University, and has given some\r\nvaluable hints to its botanical branch. He goes to do, I hope, much good\r\nin his new country; the public instruction there, as I understand,\r\nbeing within the department destined for him. He is not without\r\ndissatisfaction, and reasonable dissatisfaction, too, with the piracies\r\nof Baltimore; but his justice and friendly dispositions will, I am sure,\r\ndistinguish between the iniquities of a few plunderers, and the sound\r\nprinciples of our country at large, and of our government especially.\r\nFrom many conversations with him, I hope he sees, and will promote, in\r\nhis new situation, the advantages of a cordial fraternization among\r\nall the American nations, and the importance of their coalescing in an\r\nAmerican system of policy, totally independent of, and unconnected with\r\nthat of Europe. The day is not distant, when we may formally require\r\na meridian of partition through the ocean which separates the two\r\nhemispheres, on the hither side of which no European gun shall ever be\r\nheard, nor an American on the other; and when, during the rage of the\r\neternal wars of Europe, the lion and the lamb, within our regions, shall\r\nlie down together in peace. The excess of population in Europe, and\r\nwant of room, render war, in their opinion, necessary to keep down that\r\nexcess of numbers. Here, room is abundant, population scanty, and peace\r\nthe necessary means for producing men, to whom the redundant soil is\r\noffering the means of life and happiness. The principles of society\r\nthere and here, then, are radically different, and I hope no American\r\npatriot will ever lose sight of the essential policy of interdicting in\r\nthe seas and territories of both Americas, the ferocious and sanguinary\r\ncontests of Europe. I wish to see this coalition begun. I am earnest for\r\nan agreement with the maritime powers of Europe, assigning them the task\r\nof keeping down the piracies of their seas and the cannibalisms of\r\nthe African coasts, and, to us, the suppression of the same enormities\r\nwithin our seas: and for this purpose, I should rejoice to see the\r\nfleets of Brazil and the United States riding together as brethren of\r\nthe same family, and pursuing the same object. And indeed it would be\r\nof happy augury to begin at once this concert of action here, on the\r\ninvitation of either to the other government, while the way might be\r\npreparing for withdrawing our cruisers from Europe, and preventing naval\r\ncollisions there which daily endanger our peace.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of the sincerity of my friendship and respect for you.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLIV.--TO JOHN ADAMS, August 15, 1820\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nMonticello, August 15, 1820.\r\n\r\nI am a great defaulter, my Dear Sir, in our correspondence, but\r\nprostrate health rarely permits me to write; and when it does, matters\r\nof business imperiously press their claims. I am getting better however,\r\nslowly, swelled legs being now the only serious symptom, and these, I\r\nbelieve, proceed from extreme debility. I can walk but little; but I\r\nride six or eight miles a day without fatigue; and within a few days,\r\nI shall endeavor to visit my other home, after a twelvemonth’s absence\r\nfrom it. Our University, four miles distant, gives me frequent exercise,\r\nand the oftener, as I direct its architecture. Its plan is unique, and\r\nit is becoming an object of curiosity for the traveller. I have lately\r\nhad an opportunity of reading a critique on this institution in your\r\nNorth American Review of January last, having been not without anxiety\r\nto see what that able work would say of us: and I was relieved on\r\nfinding in it much coincidence of opinion, and even where criticisms\r\nwhere indulged, I found they would have been obviated had the\r\ndevelopements of our plan been fuller. But these were restrained by the\r\ncharacter of the paper reviewed, being merely a report of outlines,\r\nnot a detailed treatise, and addressed to a legislative body, not to\r\na learned academy. For example, as an inducement to introduce the\r\nAnglo-Saxon into our plan, it was said that it would reward amply\r\nthe few weeks of attention which alone would be requisite for its\r\nattainment; leaving both term and degree under an indefinite expression,\r\nbecause I know that not much time is necessary to attain it to an useful\r\ndegree, sufficient to give such instruction in the etymologies of our\r\nlanguage as may satisfy ordinary students, while more time would be\r\nrequisite for those who should propose to attain a critical knowledge\r\nof it. In a letter which I had occasion to write to Mr. Crofts who sent\r\nyou, I believe, as well as myself, a copy of his treatise on the English\r\nand German languages, as preliminary to an etymological dictionary he\r\nmeditated, I went into explanations with him of an easy process for\r\nsimplifying the study of the Anglo-Saxon, and lessening the terrors and\r\ndifficulties presented by it’s rude alphabet, and unformed orthography.\r\nBut this is a subject beyond the bounds of a letter, as it was beyond\r\nthe bounds of a report to the legislature. Mr. Crofts died, I believe,\r\nbefore any progress was made in the work he had projected.\r\n\r\nThe reviewer expresses doubt, rather than decision, on our placing\r\nmilitary and naval architecture in the department of pure mathematics.\r\nMilitary architecture embraces fortification and field works, which,\r\nwith their bastions, curtains, hornworks, redoubts, &c. are based on a\r\ntechnical combination of lines and angles. These are adapted to offence\r\nand defence, with and against the effects of bombs, balls, escalades,\r\nhe. But lines and angles make the sum of elementary geometry, a branch\r\nof pure mathematics: and the direction of the bombs, balls, and other\r\nprojectiles, the necessary appendages of military works, although no\r\npart of their architecture, belong to the conic sections, a branch of\r\ntranscendental geometry. Diderot and D’Alembert, therefore, in their\r\n_Arbor scienciæ_, have placed military architecture in the department\r\nof elementary geometry. Naval architecture teaches the best form and\r\nconstruction of vessels; for which best form it has recourse to the\r\nquestion of the solid of least resistance; a problem of transcendental\r\ngeometry. And its appurtenant projectiles belong to the same branch as\r\nin the preceding case. It is true, that so far as respects the action of\r\nthe water on the rudder and oars, and of the wind on the sails, it may\r\nbe placed in the department of mechanics, as Diderot and D’Alembert\r\nhave done; but belonging quite as much to geometry, and allied in its\r\nmilitary character to military architecture, it simplified our plan to\r\nplace both under the same head. These views are so obvious, that I am\r\nsure they would have required but a second thought to reconcile the\r\nreviewer to their location under the head of pure mathematics. For\r\nthis word location, see Bailey, Johnson, Sheridan, Walker, &c. But if\r\ndictionaries are to be the arbiters of language, in which of them shall\r\nwe find neologism? No matter. It is a good word, well sounding, obvious,\r\nand expresses an idea, which would otherwise require circumlocution. The\r\nreviewer was justifiable, therefore, in using it; although he noted\r\nat the same time, as unauthoritative, _centrality, grade, sparse_; all\r\nwhich have been long used in common speech and writing. I am a friend\r\nto neology. It is the only way to give to a language copiousness and\r\neuphony. Without it we should still be held to the vocabulary of Alfred\r\nor of Ulphilas; and held to their state of science also: for I am\r\nsure they had no words which could have conveyed the ideas of oxygen,\r\ncotyledons, zoophytes, magnetism, electricity, hyaline, and thousands of\r\nothers expressing ideas not then existing, nor of possible communication\r\nin the state of their language. What a language has the French become\r\nsince the date of their revolution, by the free introduction of new\r\nwords! The most copious and eloquent in the living world; and equal to\r\nthe Greek, had not that been regularly modifiable almost _ad infinitum_.\r\nTheir rule was, that whenever their language furnished or adopted a\r\nroot, all its branches in every part of speech, were legitimated by\r\ngiving them their appropriate terminations:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: page331]\r\n\r\nAnd this should be the law of every language. Thus, having adopted the\r\nadjective fraternal, it is a root which should legitimate fraternity,\r\nfraternation, fraternization, fraternism, to fratenate, fraternize,\r\nfraternally. And give the word neologism to our language, as a root,\r\nand it should give us its fellow substantives, neology, neologist,\r\nneologization; its adjectives, neologous, neological, neologistical;\r\nits verb, neologize; and adverb neologically. Dictionaries are but\r\nthe depositories of words already legitimated by usage. Society is the\r\nwork-shop in which new ones are elaborated. When an individual uses\r\na new word, if ill formed, it is rejected in society, if well formed,\r\nadopted, and after due time, laid up in the depository of dictionaries.\r\nAnd if, in this process of sound neologization, our trans-Atlantic\r\nbrethren shall not choose to accompany us, we may furnish, after\r\nthe Ionians, a second example of a colonial dialect improving on its\r\nprimitive.\r\n\r\nBut enough of criticism: let me turn to your puzzling letter of May the\r\n12th, on matter, spirit, motion, &c. Its crowd of scepticisms kept me\r\nfrom sleep. I read it, and laid it down: read it, and laid it down,\r\nagain and again: and to give rest to my mind, I was obliged to recur\r\nultimately to my habitual anodyne, ‘I feel, therefore I exist.’ I feel\r\nbodies which are not myself: there are other existences then. I call\r\nthem matter. I feel them changing place. This gives me motion. Where\r\nthere is an absence of matter, I call it void, or nothing, or immaterial\r\nspace. On the basis of sensation, of matter and motion, we may erect\r\nthe fabric of all the certainties we can have or need. I can conceive\r\nthought to be an action of a particular organization of matter, formed\r\nfor that purpose by its creator, as well as that attraction is an action\r\nof matter, or magnetism of loadstone. When he who denies to the Creator\r\nthe power of endowing matter with the mode of action called thinking,\r\nshall show how he could endow the sun with the mode of action called\r\nattraction, which reins the planets in the track of their orbits, or how\r\nan absence of matter can have a will, and by that will put matter into\r\nmotion, then the Materialist may be lawfully required to explain the\r\nprocess by which matter exercises the faculty of thinking. When once we\r\nquit the basis of sensation, all is in the wind. To talk of immaterial\r\nexistences, is to talk of nothings. To say that the human soul, angels,\r\nGod, are immaterial, is to say, they are nothings, or that there is no\r\nGod, no angels, no soul. I cannot reason otherwise: but I believe I am\r\nsupported in my creed of materialism by the Lockes, the Tracys, and\r\nthe Stewarts. At what age* of the Christian church this heresy of\r\nimmaterialism, or masked atheism, crept in, I do not exactly know. But a\r\nheresy it certainly is. Jesus taught nothing of it. He told us, indeed,\r\nthat ‘God is a spirit,’ but he has not defined what a spirit is, nor\r\nsaid that it is not matter. And the ancient fathers generally, of the\r\nthree first centuries, held it to be matter, light and thin indeed, an\r\nethereal gas; but still matter. Origen says. ‘_Deus reapse corporalis\r\nest; sed graviorum tantum ratione corporum incorporeus_.’ Tertullian,’\r\n_Quid enim Deus nisi corpus?_’ And again, ‘_Quis negabit Deum esse\r\ncorpus? Etsi Deus spiritus, spiritus etiam corpus est, sui generis in\r\nsua effigie_. St. Justin Martyr,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 332]\r\n\r\nAnd St. Macarius, speaking of angels, says, ‘_Quamvis enim subtilia\r\nsint, tamen in substantia, forma, et figura, secundum tenuitatem naturas\r\neorum, corpora sunt tenuia_.’ And St. Austin, St. Basil, Lactantius,\r\nTatian, Athenagoras, and others, with whose writings I pretend not a\r\nfamiliarity, are said by those who are better acquainted with them,\r\nto deliver the same doctrine. (Enfield x. 3. 1.) Turn to your Ocellus\r\nd’Argens, 97, 105. and to his Timseus 17. for these quotations. In\r\nEngland, these Immaterialists might have been burnt until the 29 Car. 2.\r\nwhen the writ _de hæretico comburendo_ was abolished; and here until the\r\nRevolution, that statute not having extended to us. All heresies being\r\nnow done away with us, these schismatists are merely atheists, differing\r\nfrom the material atheist only in their belief, that ‘nothing made\r\nsomething,’ and from the material deist, who believes that matter alone\r\ncan operate on matter.\r\n\r\n     [* That of Athanasius and the Council of Nicasa, anno 324]\r\n\r\nRejecting all organs of information, therefore, but my senses, I rid\r\nmyself of the pyrrhonisms with which an indulgence in speculations\r\nhyperphysical and antiphysical, so uselessly occupy and disquiet the\r\nmind. A single sense may indeed be sometimes deceived, but rarely; and\r\nnever all our senses together, with their faculty of reasoning. They\r\nevidence realities, and there are enough of these for all the purposes\r\nof life, without plunging into the fathomless abyss of dreams and\r\nphantasms. I am satisfied, and sufficiently occupied with the things\r\nwhich are, without tormenting or troubling myself about those which may\r\nindeed be, but of which I have no evidence. I am sure that I really know\r\nmany, many things, and none more surely than that I love you with all\r\nmy heart, and pray for the continuance of your life until you shall be\r\ntired of it yourself.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLV.--TO JOSEPH C. CABELL, November 28, 1820\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH C. CABELL.\r\n\r\nPoplar Forest, November 28, 1820.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI sent in due time the Report of the Visitors to the Governor, with a\r\nrequest that he would endeavor to convene the Literary Board in time to\r\nlay it before the legislature on the second day of their session. It\r\nwas enclosed in a letter which will explain itself to you. If delivered\r\nbefore the crowd of other business presses on them, they may act on\r\nit immediately, and before there will have been time for unfriendly\r\ncombinations and manoeuvres by the enemies of the institution. I enclose\r\nyou now a paper presenting some views which may be useful to you in\r\nconversations, to rebut exaggerated estimates of what our institution\r\nis to cost, and reproaches of deceptive estimates. One hundred and\r\nsixty-two thousand three hundred and sixty-four dollars will be about\r\nthe cost of the whole establishment, when completed. Not an office\r\nat Washington has cost less. The single building of the courthouse of\r\nHenrico has cost nearly that: and the massive walls of the millions of\r\nbricks of William and Mary could not now be built for a less sum.\r\n\r\nSurely Governor Clinton’s display of the gigantic efforts of New York\r\ntowards the education of her citizens, will stimulate the pride as well\r\nas the patriotism of our legislature, to look to the reputation and\r\nsafety of their own country, to rescue it from the degradation of\r\nbecoming the Barbary of the Union, and of falling into the ranks of our\r\nown negroes. To that condition it is fast sinking. We shall be in the\r\nhands of the other States, what our indigenous predecessors were when\r\ninvaded by the science and arts of Europe. The mass of education in\r\nVirginia, before the Revolution, placed her with the foremost of her\r\nsister colonies. What is her education now? Where is it? The little\r\nwe have, we import, like beggars, from other States; or import their\r\nbeggars to bestow on us their miserable crumbs. And what is wanting to\r\nrestore us to our station among our confederates? Not more money from\r\nthe people. Enough has been raised by them, and appropriated to this\r\nvery object. It is that it should be employed understandingly, and for\r\ntheir greatest good. That good requires, that while they are instructed\r\nin general, competently to the common business of life, others should\r\nemploy their genius with necessary information to the useful arts, to\r\ninventions for saving labor and increasing our comforts, to nourishing\r\nour health, to civil government, military science, &c.\r\n\r\nWould it not have a good effect for the friends of the University\r\nto take the lead in proposing and effecting a practical scheme of\r\nelementary schools? to assume the character of the friends, rather than\r\nthe opponents of that object? The present plan has appropriated to the\r\nprimary schools forty-five thousand dollars for three years, making one\r\nhundred and thirty-five thousand dollars. I should be glad to know if\r\nthis sum has educated one hundred and thirty-five poor children? I doubt\r\nit much. And if it has, they have cost us one thousand dollars a\r\npiece for what might have been done with thirty dollars. Supposing the\r\nliterary revenue to be sixty thousand dollars, I think it demonstrable,\r\nthat this sum, equally divided between the two objects, would amply\r\nsuffice for both. One hundred counties, divided into about twelve wards\r\neach, on an average, and a school in each ward of perhaps ten\r\nchildren, would be one thousand and two hundred schools, distributed\r\nproportionably over the surface of the State. The inhabitants of each\r\nward, meeting together (as when they work on the roads), building\r\ngood log-houses for their school and teacher, and contributing for his\r\nprovisions, rations of pork, beef, and corn, in the proportion, each of\r\nhis other taxes, would thus lodge and feed him without feeling it;\r\nand those of them who are able, paying for the tuition of their own\r\nchildren, would leave no call on the public fund but for the tuition\r\nfee of, here and there, an accidental pauper, who would still be fed and\r\nlodged with his parents. Suppose this fee ten dollars, and three\r\nhundred dollars apportioned to a county on an average (more or less duly\r\nproportioned), would there be thirty such paupers for every county? I\r\nthink not. The truth is, that the want of common education with us is\r\nnot from our poverty, but from want of an orderly system. More money is\r\nnow paid for the education of a part, than would be paid for that of the\r\nwhole, if systematically arranged. Six thousand common schools in New\r\nYork, fifty pupils in each, three hundred thousand in all; one\r\nhundred and sixty thousand dollars annually paid to the masters; forty\r\nestablished academies, with two thousand two hundred and eighteen\r\npupils; and five colleges, with seven hundred and eighteen students;\r\nto which last classes of institutions seven hundred and twenty thousand\r\ndollars have been given; and the whole appropriations for education\r\nestimated at two and a half millions of dollars! What a pigmy to this is\r\nVirginia become, with a population almost equal to that of New York!\r\nAnd whence this difference? From the difference their rulers set on\r\nthe value of knowledge, and the prosperity it produces. But still, if a\r\npigmy, let her do what a pigmy may do. If among fifty children in each\r\nof the six thousand schools of New York, there are only paupers enough\r\nto employ twenty-five dollars of public money to each school, surely\r\namong the ten children of each of our one thousand and two hundred\r\nschools, the same sum of twenty-five dollars to each school will teach\r\nits paupers (five times as much as to the same number in New York), and\r\nwill amount for the whole to thirty thousand dollars a year, the one\r\nhalf only of our literary revenue.\r\n\r\nDo then, Dear Sir, think of this, and engage our friends to take in\r\nhand the whole subject. It will reconcile the friends of the elementary\r\nschools, and none are more warmly so than myself, lighten the\r\ndifficulties of the University, and promote in every order of men the\r\ndegree of instruction proportioned to their condition, and to their\r\nviews in life. It will combine with the mass of our force, a wise\r\ndirection of it, which will insure to our country its future prosperity\r\nand safety. I had formerly thought that visitors of the schools might\r\nbe chosen by the county, and charged to provide teachers for every ward,\r\nand to superintend them. I now think it would be better for every ward\r\nto choose its own resident visitor, whose business it would be to keep a\r\nteacher in the ward, to superintend the school, and to call meetings of\r\nthe ward for all purposes relating to it: their accounts to be settled,\r\nand wards laid off by the courts. I think ward elections better for\r\nmany reasons, one of which is sufficient, that it will keep elementary\r\neducation out of the hands of fanaticizing preachers, who, in county\r\nelections, would be universally chosen, and the predominant sect of the\r\ncounty would possess itself of all its schools.\r\n\r\nA wrist stiffened by an ancient accident, now more so by the effect of\r\nage, renders writing a slow and irksome operation with me. I cannot,\r\ntherefore, present these views by separate letters to each of our\r\ncolleagues in the legislature, but must pray you to communicate them to\r\nMr. Johnson and General Breckenridge, and to request them to\r\nconsider this as equally meant for them. Mr. Gordon, being the local\r\nrepresentative of the University and among its most zealous friends,\r\nwould be a more useful second to General Breckenridge in the House of\r\nDelegates, by a free communication of what concerns the University, with\r\nwhich he has had little opportunity of becoming acquainted. So also,\r\nwould it be as to Mr. Rives, who would be a friendly advocate.\r\n\r\nAccept the assurances of my constant and affectionate esteem and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLVI.--TO THOMAS RITCHIE, December, 25, 1820\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS RITCHIE.\r\n\r\nMonticello, December, 25, 1820.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nOn my return home after a long absence, I find here your favor of\r\nNovember the 23rd, with Colonel Taylor’s ‘Construction Construed,’ which\r\nyou have been so kind as to send me, in the name of the author as well\r\nas yourself. Permit me, if you please, to use the same channel\r\nfor conveying to him the thanks I render you also for this mark of\r\nattention. I shall read it, I know, with edification, as I did his\r\nEnquiry, to which I acknowledge myself indebted for many valuable ideas,\r\nand for the correction of some errors of early opinion, never seen in\r\na correct light until presented to me in that work. That the present\r\nvolume is equally orthodox I know before reading it, because I know\r\nthat Colonel Taylor and myself have rarely, if ever, differed in any\r\npolitical principle of importance. Every act of his life, and every word\r\nhe ever wrote, satisfies me of this. So, also, as to the two Presidents,\r\nlate and now in office, I know them both to be of principles as truly\r\nrepublican as any men living. If there be any thing amiss, therefore,\r\nin the present state of our affairs, as the formidable deficit lately\r\nunfolded to us indicates, I ascribe it to the inattention of Congress\r\nto their duties, to their unwise dissipation and waste of the public\r\ncontributions. They seemed, some little while ago, to be at a loss\r\nfor objects whereon to throw away the supposed fathomless funds of the\r\ntreasury. I had feared the result, because I saw among them some of my\r\nold fellow-laborers, of tried and known principles, yet often in their\r\nminorities. I am aware that in one of their most ruinous vagaries,\r\nthe people were themselves betrayed into the same phrenzy with their\r\nRepresentatives. The deficit produced, and a heavy tax to supply it,\r\nwill, I trust, bring both to their sober senses.\r\n\r\nBut it is not from this branch of government we have most to fear. Taxes\r\nand short elections will keep them right. The judiciary of the United\r\nStates is the subtle corps of sappers and miners constantly working\r\nunder ground to undermine the foundations of our confederated fabric.\r\nThey are construing our constitution from a co-ordination of a general\r\nand special government to a general and supreme one alone. This will lay\r\nall things at their feet, and they are too well versed in English law to\r\nforget the maxim, ‘_Boni judicis est ampliare jurisdictionem._’ We shall\r\nsee if they are bold enough to take the daring stride their five lawyers\r\nhave lately taken. If they do, then, with the editor of our book in his\r\naddress to the public, I will say, that against this every man should\r\nraise his voice, and more, should uplift his arm. Who wrote this\r\nadmirable address? Sound, luminous, strong, not a word too much, nor one\r\nwhich can be changed but for the worse. That pen should go on, lay bare\r\nthese wounds of our constitution, expose these _decisions seriatim_,\r\nand arouse, as it is able, the attention of the nation to these bold\r\nspeculators on its patience. Having found, from experience, that\r\nimpeachment is an impracticable thing, a mere scare-crow, they consider\r\nthemselves secure for life; they skulk from responsibility to public\r\nopinion, the only remaining hold on them, under a practice first\r\nintroduced into England by Lord Mansfield. An opinion is huddled up in\r\nconclave, perhaps by a majority of one, delivered as if unanimous and\r\nwith the silent acquiescence of lazy or timid associates, by a crafty\r\nchief judge, who sophisticates the law to his mind, by the turn of his\r\nown reasoning. A judiciary law was once reported by the Attorney General\r\nto Congress, requiring each judge to deliver his opinion _seriatim_ and\r\nopenly, and then to give it in writing to the clerk to be entered in the\r\nrecord. A judiciary independent of a King or executive alone, is a good\r\nthing; but independence of the will of the nation is a solecism, at\r\nleast in a republican government.\r\n\r\nBut to return to your letter; you ask for my opinion of the work you\r\nsend me, and to let it go out to the public. This I have ever made a\r\npoint of declining (one or two instances only excepted). Complimentary\r\nthanks to writers who have sent me their works, have betrayed me\r\nsometimes before the public, without my consent having been asked. But\r\nI am far from presuming to direct the reading of my fellow-citizens, who\r\nare good enough judges themselves of what is worthy their reading. I am,\r\nalso, too desirous of quiet to place myself in the way of contention.\r\nAgainst this I am admonished by bodily decay, which cannot be\r\nunaccompanied by corresponding wane of the mind. Of this I am as yet\r\nsensible sufficiently to be unwilling to trust myself before the public,\r\nand when I cease to be so, I hope that my friends will be too careful\r\nof me to draw me forth and present me, like a Priam in armor, as a\r\nspectacle for public compassion. I hope our political bark will ride\r\nthrough all its dangers; but I can in future be but an inert passenger.\r\n\r\nI salute you with sentiments of great friendship and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLVII.--TO JOHN ADAMS, January 22, 1821\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nMonticello, January 22, 1821.\r\n\r\nI was quite rejoiced, dear Sir, to see that you had health and spirits\r\nenough to take part in the late convention of your State, for revising\r\nits constitution, and to bear your share in its debates and labors.\r\nThe amendments of which we have as yet heard, prove the advance of\r\nliberalism in the intervening period; and encourage a hope that the\r\nhuman mind will some day get back to the freedom it enjoyed two thousand\r\nyears ago. This country, which has given to the world the example of\r\nphysical liberty, owes to it that of moral emancipation also, for as yet\r\nit is but nominal with us. The inquisition of public opinion overwhelms,\r\nin practice, the freedom asserted by the laws in theory.\r\n\r\nOur anxieties in this quarter are all concentrated in the question, what\r\ndoes the Holy Alliance in and out of Congress mean to do with us on the\r\nMissouri question? And this, by the bye, is but the name of the case, it\r\nis only the John Doe or Richard Roe of the ejectment. The real question,\r\nas seen in the States afflicted with this unfortunate population,\r\nis, Are our slaves to be presented with freedom and a dagger? For if\r\nCongress has the power to regulate the conditions of the inhabitants of\r\nthe States, within the States, it will be but another exercise of that\r\npower, to declare that all shall be free. Are we then to see again\r\nAthenian and Lacedæmonian confederacies? To wage another Peloponnesian\r\nwar to settle the ascendancy between them? Or is this the tocsin of\r\nmerely a servile war? That remains to be seen: but not, I hope, by you\r\nor me. Surely, they will parley awhile, and give us time to get out\r\nof the way. What a Bedlamite is man? But let us turn from our own\r\nuneasiness to the miseries of our southern friends. Bolivar and Morillo,\r\nit seems, have come to a parley, with dispositions at length to stop\r\nthe useless effusion of human blood in that quarter. I feared from the\r\nbeginning, that these people were not yet sufficiently enlightened for\r\nself-government; and that after wading through blood and slaughter,\r\nthey would end in military tyrannies, more or less numerous. Yet as they\r\nwished to try the experiment, I wished them success in it: they have\r\nnow tried it, and will possibly find that their safest road will be an\r\naccommodation with the mother country, which shall hold them together\r\nby the single link of the same chief magistrate, leaving to him power\r\nenough to keep them in peace with one another, and to themselves the\r\nessential power of self-government and self-improvement, until they\r\nshall be sufficiently trained by education and habits of freedom,\r\nto walk safely by themselves. Representative government, native\r\nfunctionaries, a qualified negative on their laws, with a previous\r\nsecurity by compact for freedom of commerce, freedom of the press,\r\nhabeas corpus, and trial by jury, would make a good beginning. This\r\nlast would be the school in which their people might begin to learn the\r\nexercise of civic duties as well as rights. For freedom of religion they\r\nare not yet prepared. The scales of bigotry have not sufficiently fallen\r\nfrom their eyes, to accept it for themselves individually, much less to\r\ntrust others with it. But that will come in time, as well as a general\r\nripeness to break entirely from the parent stem. You see, my dear Sir,\r\nhow easily we prescribe for others a cure for their difficulties, while\r\nwe cannot cure our own. We must leave both, I believe, to Heaven, and\r\nwrap ourselves up in the mantle of resignation, and of that friendship\r\nof which I tender to you the most sincere assurances.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLVIII.--TO JOSEPH C CABELL, January 31, 1821\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH C CABELL.\r\n\r\nMonticello, January 31, 1821.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favors of the 18th and 25th came together, three days ago. They\r\nfill me with gloom as to the dispositions of our legislature towards\r\nthe University. I perceive that I am not to live to see it opened. As\r\nto what had better be done within the limits of their will, I trust\r\nwith entire confidence to what yourself, General Breckenridge, and Mr.\r\nJohnson shall think best. You will see what is practicable, and give it\r\nsuch shape as you think best. If a loan is to be resorted to, I think\r\nsixty thousand dollars will be necessary, including the library.\r\nIts instalments cannot begin until those of the former loan are\r\naccomplished; and they should not begin later, nor be less than thirteen\r\nthousand dollars a year. (I think it safe to retain two thousand dollars\r\na year for care of the buildings, improvement of the grounds, and\r\nunavoidable contingencies.) To extinguish the second loan, will require\r\nbetween five and six instalments, which will carry us to the end of\r\n1833, or thirteen years from this time. My individual opinion is, that\r\nwe had better not open the institution until the buildings, library, and\r\nall, are finished, and our funds cleared of incumbrance. These buildings\r\nonce erected, will secure the full object infallibly at the end of\r\nthirteen years, and as much earlier as the legislature shall choose. And\r\nif we were to begin sooner, with half funds only, it would satisfy the\r\ncommon mind, prevent their aid beyond that point, and our institution,\r\nremaining at that for ever, would be no more than the paltry academies\r\nwe now have. Even with the whole funds we shall be reduced to six\r\nProfessors. While Harvard will still prime it over us with her twenty\r\nProfessors. How many of our youths she now has, learning the lessons of\r\nanti-Missourianism, I know not; but a gentleman lately from Princeton\r\ntold me he saw there the list of the students at that place, and that\r\nmore than half were Virginians. These will return home, no doubt,\r\ndeeply impressed with the sacred principles of our Holy Alliance of\r\nrestrictionists.\r\n\r\nBut the gloomiest of all prospects, is in the desertion of the best\r\nfriends of the institution, for desertion I must call it. I know not the\r\nnecessities which may force this on you. General Cocke, you say, will\r\nexplain them to me; but I cannot conceive them, nor persuade myself\r\nthey are uncontrollable. I have ever hoped, that yourself, General\r\nBreckenridge, and Mr. Johnson, would stand at your posts in the\r\nlegislature, until every thing was effected, and the institution opened.\r\nIf it is so difficult to get along with all the energy and influence of\r\nour present colleagues in the legislature, how can we expect to proceed\r\nat all, reducing our moving power? I know well your devotion to your\r\ncountry, and your foresight of the awful scenes coming on her, sooner or\r\nlater. With this foresight, what service can we ever render her equal\r\nto this? What object of our lives can we propose so important? What\r\ninterest of our own which ought not to be postponed to this? Health,\r\ntime, labor, on what in the single life which nature has given us, can\r\nthese be better bestowed than on this immortal boon to our country? The\r\nexertions and the mortifications are temporary; the benefit eternal. If\r\nany member of our college of Visitors could justifiably withdraw from\r\nthis sacred duty, it would be myself, who _quadragenis stipendiis\r\njamdudum peractis_, have neither vigor of body nor mind left to keep\r\nthe field: but I will die in the last ditch, and so I hope you will,\r\nmy friend, as well as our firm-breasted brothers and colleagues, Mr.\r\nJohnson and General Breckenridge. Nature will not give you a second life\r\nwherein to atone for the omissions of this. Pray then, dear and very\r\ndear Sir, do not think of deserting us, but view the sacrifices which\r\nseem to stand in your way, as the lesser duties, and such as ought to be\r\npostponed to this, the greatest of all. Continue with us in these holy\r\nlabors, until, having seen their accomplishment, we may say with old\r\nSimeon, ‘_Nunc dimittas, Domine_. Under all circumstances, however, of\r\npraise or blame, I shall be affectionately yours.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLIX.--TO GENERAL BRECKENRIDGE, February 15, 1821\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL BRECKENRIDGE.\r\n\r\nMonticello, February 15, 1821.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI learn with deep affliction, that nothing is likely to be done for our\r\nUniversity this year. So near as it is to the shore that one shove more\r\nwould land it there, I had hoped that would be given; and that we should\r\nopen with the next year an institution on which the fortunes of our\r\ncountry may depend more than may meet the general eye. The reflections\r\nthat the boys of this age are to be the men of the next; that they\r\nshould be prepared to receive the holy charge which we are cherishing to\r\ndeliver over to them; that in establishing an institution of wisdom for\r\nthem, we secure it to all our future generations; that in fulfilling\r\nthis duty, we bring home to our own bosoms the sweet consolation of\r\nseeing our sons rising under a luminous tuition, to destinies of high\r\npromise; these are considerations which will occur to all; but all, I\r\nfear, do not see the speck in our horizon which is to burst on us as a\r\ntornado, sooner or later. The line of division lately marked out between\r\ndifferent portions of our confederacy, is such as will never, I fear,\r\nbe obliterated, and we are now trusting to those who are against us\r\nin position and principle, to fashion to their own form the minds\r\nand affections of our youth. If, as has been estimated, we send three\r\nhundred thousand dollars a year to the northern seminaries, for the\r\ninstruction of our own sons, then we must have there five hundred of our\r\nsons, imbibing opinions and principles in discord with those of their\r\nown country. This canker is eating on the vitals of our existence, and\r\nif not arrested at once, will be beyond remedy. We are now certainly\r\nfurnishing recruits to their school. If it be asked what are we to do,\r\nor said we cannot give the last lift to the University without stopping\r\nour primary schools, and these we think most important; I answer, I know\r\ntheir importance. Nobody can doubt my zeal for the general instruction\r\nof the people. Who first started that idea? I may surely say, Myself.\r\nTurn to the bill in the revised code, which I drew more than forty\r\nyears ago, and before which the idea of a plan for the education of the\r\npeople, generally, had never been suggested in this State. There you\r\nwill see developed the first rudiments of the whole system of general\r\neducation we are now urging and acting on: and it is well known to those\r\nWith whom I have acted on this subject, that I never have proposed a\r\nsacrifice of the primary to the ultimate grade of instruction. Let us\r\nkeep our eye steadily on the whole system. If we cannot do every\r\nthing at once, let us do one at a time. The primary schools need\r\nno preliminary expense; the ultimate grade requires a considerable\r\nexpenditure in advance. A suspension of proceeding for a year or two on\r\nthe primary schools, and an application of the whole income, during that\r\ntime, to the completion of the buildings necessary for the University,\r\nwould enable us then to start both institutions at the same time. The\r\nintermediate branch, of colleges, academies, and private classical\r\nschools, for the middle grade, may hereafter receive any necessary aids\r\nwhen the funds shall become competent. In the mean time, they are going\r\non sufficiently, as they have ever yet gone on, at the private expense\r\nof those who use them, and who in numbers and means are competent to\r\ntheir own exigencies. The experience of three years has, I presume, left\r\nno doubt, that the present plan of primary schools, of putting money\r\ninto the hands of twelve hundred persons acting for nothing, and under\r\nno responsibility, is entirely inefficient. Some other must be thought\r\nof; and during this pause, if it be only for a year, the whole revenue\r\nof that year, with that of the last three years which has not been\r\nalready thrown away, would place our University in readiness to start\r\nwith a better organization of primary schools, and both may then go on,\r\nhand in hand, for ever. No diminution of the capital will in this way\r\nhave been incurred; a principle which ought to be deemed sacred. A\r\nrelinquishment of interest on the late loan of sixty thousand dollars,\r\nwould so far, also, forward the University without lessening the\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nBut what may be best done I leave with entire confidence to yourself and\r\nyour colleagues in legislation, who know better than I do the conditions\r\nof the literary fund and its wisest application; and I shall acquiesce\r\nwith perfect resignation to their will. I have brooded, perhaps with\r\nfondness, over this establishment, as it held up to me the hope of\r\ncontinuing to be useful while I continued to live. I had believed that\r\nthe course and circumstances of my life had placed within my power some\r\nservices favorable to the outset of the institution. But this may be\r\negoism; pardonable, perhaps, when I express a consciousness that my\r\ncolleagues and successors will do as well, whatever the legislature\r\nshall enable them to do.\r\n\r\nI have thus, my dear Sir, opened my bosom, with all its anxieties,\r\nfreely to you. I blame nobody for seeing things in a different light. I\r\nam sure that all act conscientiously, and that all will be done honestly\r\nand wisely which can be done. I yield the concerns of the world with\r\ncheerfulness to those who are appointed in the order of nature to\r\nsucceed to them; and for yourself, for our colleagues, and for all in\r\ncharge of our country’s future fame and fortune, I offer up sincere\r\nprayers.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLX.--TO --------- NICHOLAS, December 11,1821\r\n\r\n\r\nTO --------- NICHOLAS.\r\n\r\nMonticello, December 11,1821,\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour letter of December the 19th places me under a dilemma, which I\r\ncannot solve but by an exposition of the naked truth. I would have\r\nwished this rather to have remained as hitherto, without inquiry; but\r\nyour inquiries have a right to be answered. I will do it as exactly\r\nas the great lapse of time and a waning memory will enable me. I may\r\nmisremember indifferent circumstances, but can be right in substance.\r\n\r\nAt the time when the republicans of our country were so much alarmed at\r\nthe proceedings of the federal ascendancy in Congress, in the\r\nexecutive and the judiciary departments, it became a matter of serious\r\nconsideration how head could be made against their enterprises on the\r\nconstitution. The leading republicans in Congress found themselves of\r\nno use there, browbeaten, as they were, by a bold and overwhelming\r\nmajority. They concluded to retire from that field, take a stand in the\r\nState legislatures, and endeavor there to arrest their progress. The\r\nalien and sedition laws furnished the particular occasion. The sympathy\r\nbetween Virginia and Kentucky was more cordial, and more intimately\r\nconfidential, than between any other two States of republican policy.\r\nMr. Madison came into the Virginia legislature. 1 was then in the\r\nVice-Presidency, and could not leave my station. But your father,\r\nColonel W. C. Nicholas, and myself happening to be together, the\r\nengaging the co-operation of Kentucky in an energetic protestation\r\nagainst the constitutionality of those laws, became a subject of\r\nconsultation. Those gentlemen pressed me strongly to sketch resolutions\r\nfor that purpose, your father undertaking to introduce them to that\r\nlegislature, with a solemn assurance, which I strictly required, that\r\nit should not be known from what quarter they came. I drew and delivered\r\nthem to him, and, in keeping their origin secret, he fulfilled his\r\npledge of honor. Some years after this, Colonel Nicholas asked me if\r\nI would have any objection to its being known that I had drawn them.\r\nI pointedly enjoined that it should not. Whether he had unguardedly\r\nintimated it before to any one, I know not: but I afterwards observed in\r\nthe papers repeated imputations of them to me; on which, as has been my\r\npractice on all occasions of imputation, I have observed entire silence.\r\nThe question, indeed, has never before been put to me, nor should I\r\nanswer it to any other than yourself; seeing no good end to be proposed\r\nby it, and the desire of tranquillity inducing with me a wish to be\r\nwithdrawn from public notice. Your father’s zeal and talents were too\r\nwell known, to derive any additional distinction from the penning these\r\nresolutions. That circumstance, surely, was of far less merit than the,\r\nproposing and carrying them through the legislature of his State. The\r\nonly fact in this statement, on which my memory is not distinct, is\r\nthe time and occasion of the consultation with your father and Colonel\r\nNicholas. It took place here I know; but whether any other person was\r\npresent, or communicated with, is my doubt. I think Mr. Madison was\r\neither with us, or consulted, but my memory is uncertain as to minute\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\nI fear, Dear Sir, we are now in such another crisis, with this\r\ndifference only, that the judiciary branch is alone and single-handed in\r\nthe present assaults on the constitution. But its assaults are more sure\r\nand deadly, as from an agent seemingly passive and unassuming. May you\r\nand your cotemporaries meet them with the same determination and effect,\r\nas your father and his did the alien and sedition laws, and preserve\r\ninviolate a constitution, which, cherished in all its chastity and\r\npurity, will prove in the end a blessing to all the nations of the\r\nearth. With these prayers, accept those for your own happiness and\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXI.--TO JEDIDIAH MORSE, March 6, 1822\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JEDIDIAH MORSE.\r\n\r\nMonticello, March 6, 1822.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have duly received your letter of February the 16th, and have now to\r\nexpress my sense of the honorable station proposed to my ex-brethren\r\nand myself, in the constitution of the society for the civilization and\r\nimprovement of the Indian tribes. The object, too, expressed, as that of\r\nthe association, is one which I have ever had much at heart, and never\r\nomitted an occasion of promoting, while I have been in situations to\r\ndo it with effect, and nothing, even now, in the calm of age and\r\nretirement, would excite in me a more lively interest than an approvable\r\nplan of raising that respectable and unfortunate people from the state\r\nof physical and moral abjection, to which they have been reduced by\r\ncircumstances foreign to them. That the plan now proposed is entitled\r\nto unmixed approbation, I am not prepared to say, after mature\r\nconsideration, and with all the partialities which its professed object\r\nwould rightfully claim from me.\r\n\r\nI shall not undertake to draw the line of demarcation between private\r\nassociations of laudable views and unimposing numbers, and those whose\r\nmagnitude may rivalize and jeopardize the march of regular government.\r\nYet such a line does exist. I have seen the days, they were those which\r\npreceded the Revolution, when even this last and perilous engine became\r\nnecessary; but they were days which no man would wish to see a second\r\ntime. That was the case where the regular authorities of the government\r\nhad combined against the rights of the people, and no means of\r\ncorrection remained to them, but to organize a collateral power, which,\r\nwith their support, might rescue and secure their violated rights. But\r\nsuch is not the case with our government. We need hazard no collateral\r\npower, which, by a change of its original views, and assumption of\r\nothers we know not how virtuous or how mischievous, would be ready\r\norganized, and in force sufficient to shake the established foundations\r\nof society, and endanger its peace and the principles on which it is\r\nbased. Is not the machine now proposed of this gigantic stature? It\r\nis to consist of the ex-Presidents of the United States, the\r\nVice-President, the Heads of all the executive departments, the members\r\nof the supreme judiciary, the Governors of the several States and\r\nTerritories, all the members of both Houses of Congress, all the general\r\nofficers of the army, the commissioners of the navy, all Presidents and\r\nProfessors of colleges and theological seminaries, all the clergy of\r\nthe United States, the. Presidents and Secretaries of all associations\r\nhaving relation to Indians, all commanding officers within or near\r\nIndian territories, all Indian superintendants and agents; all these ex\r\nofficio; and as many private individuals as will pay a certain price\r\nfor membership. Observe, too, that the clergy will constitute * nineteen\r\ntwentieths of this association, and, by the law of the majority, may\r\ncommand the twentieth part, which, composed of all the high authorities\r\nof the United States, civil and military, may be outvoted and wielded\r\nby the nineteen parts with uncontrollable power, both as to purpose and\r\nprocess. . Can this formidable array be reviewed without dismay?\r\n\r\n     * The clergy of the United States may probably be estimated\r\n     at eight thousand. The residue of this society at four\r\n     hundred; but if the former number be halved, the reasoning\r\n     will be the same.\r\n\r\nIt will be said, that in this association will be all the confidential\r\nofficers of the government; the choice of the people themselves. No man\r\non earth has more implicit confidence than myself in the integrity\r\nand discretion of this chosen band of servants. But is confidence or\r\ndiscretion, or is strict limit, the principle of our constitution? It\r\nwill comprehend, indeed, all the functionaries of the government: but\r\nseceded from their consitutional stations as guardians of the nation,\r\nand acting not by the laws of their station, but by those of a voluntary\r\nsociety, having no limit to their purposes but the same will which\r\nconstitutes their existence. It will be the authorities of the people,\r\nand all influential characters from among them, arrayed on one side, and\r\non the other, the people themselves deserted by their leaders. It is a\r\nfearful array. It will be said, that these are imaginary fears. I know\r\nthey are so at present. I know it is as impossible for these agents of\r\nour choice and unbounded confidence, to harbor machinations against\r\nthe adored principles of our constitution, as for gravity to change\r\nits direction, and gravid bodies to mount upwards. The fears are indeed\r\nimaginary: but the example is real. Under its authority, as a precedent,\r\nfuture associations will arise with objects at which we should\r\nshudder at this time. The society of Jacobins, in another country,\r\nwas instituted on principles and views as virtuous as ever kindled the\r\nhearts of patriots. It was the pure patriotism of their purposes which\r\nextended their association to the limits of the nation, and rendered\r\ntheir power within it boundless; and it was this power which degenerated\r\ntheir principles and practices to such enormities, as never before could\r\nhave been imagined. Yet these were men; and we and our descendants\r\nwill be no more. The present is a case where, if ever, we are to guard\r\nagainst ourselves; not against ourselves as we are, but as we may be;\r\nfor who can now imagine what we may become under circumstances not now\r\nimaginable? The object, too, of this institution, seems to require\r\nso hazardous an example as little as any which could be proposed. The\r\ngovernment is, at this time, going on with the process of civilizing\r\nthe Indians, on a plan probably as promising as any one of us is able\r\nto devise, and with resources more competent than we could expect to\r\ncommand by voluntary taxation. Is it that the new characters called into\r\nassociation with those of the government, are wiser than these? Is it\r\nthat a plan originated by a meeting of private individuals, is better\r\nthan that prepared by the concentrated wisdom of the nation, of men not\r\nself-chosen, but clothed with the full confidence of the people? Is it\r\nthat there is no danger that a new authority, marching independently\r\nalong side of the government, in the same line and to the same object,\r\nmay not produce collision, may not thwart and obstruct the operations of\r\nthe government, or wrest the object entirely from their hands? Might we\r\nnot as well appoint a committee for each department of the government,\r\nto counsel and direct its head separately, as volunteer ourselves to\r\ncounsel and direct the whole, in mass? And might we not do it as well\r\nfor their foreign, their fiscal, and their military, as for their Indian\r\naffairs? And how many societies, auxiliary to the government, may we\r\nexpect to see spring up, in imitation of this, offering to associate\r\nthemselves in this and that of its functions? In a word, why not take\r\nthe government out of its constitutional hands, associate them indeed\r\nwith us, to preserve a semblance that the acts are theirs, but insuring\r\nthem to be our own by allowing them a minor vote only?\r\n\r\nThese considerations have impressed my mind with a force so\r\nirrresistible, that (in duty bound to answer your polite letter, without\r\nwhich I should not have obtruded an opinion) I have not been able to\r\nwithhold the expression of them. Not knowing the individuals who have\r\nproposed this plan, I cannot be conceived as entertaining personal\r\ndisrespect for them. On the contrary, I see in the printed list persons\r\nfor whom I cherish sentiments of sincere friendship; and others, for\r\nwhose opinions and purity of purpose I have the highest respect. Yet\r\nthinking, as I do, that this association is unnecessary; that the\r\ngovernment is proceeding to the same object under control of the law;\r\nthat they are competent to it in wisdom, in means, and inclination; that\r\nthis association, this wheel within a wheel, is more likely to produce\r\ncollision than aid; and that it is, in its magnitude, of dangerous\r\nexample; I am bound to say, that, as a dutiful citizen, I cannot in\r\nconscience become a member of this society, possessing as it does my\r\nentire confidence in the integrity of its views. I feel with awe the\r\nweight of opinion to which I may be opposed, and that, for myself, I\r\nhave need to ask the indulgence of a belief, that the opinion I have\r\ngiven is the best result I can deduce from my own reason and experience,\r\nand that it is sincerely conscientious. Repeating, therefore, my just\r\nacknowledgments for the honor proposed to me, I beg leave to add the\r\nassurances to the society and yourself of my highest confidence and\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXII.--TO DOCTOR BENJAMIN WATERHOUSE, June 26, 1822\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR BENJAMIN WATERHOUSE.\r\n\r\nMonticello, June 26, 1822.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have received and read with thankfulness and pleasure your\r\ndenunciation of the abuses of tobacco and wine. Yet, however sound in\r\nits principles, I expect it will be but a sermon to the wind. You will\r\nfind it is as difficult to inculcate these sanative precepts on the\r\nsensualities of the present day, as to convince an Athanasian that there\r\nis but one God. I wish success to both attempts, and am happy to learn\r\nfrom you that the latter, at least, is making progress, and the more\r\nrapidly in proportion as our Platonizing Christians make more stir and\r\nnoise about it. The doctrines of Jesus are simple, and tend all to the\r\nhappiness of man.\r\n\r\n1. That there is one only God, and he all perfect.\r\n\r\n2. That there is a future state of rewards and punishments.\r\n\r\n3. That to love God with all thy heart, and thy neighbor as thyself, is\r\nthe sum of religion. These are the great points on which he endeavored\r\nto reform the religion of the Jews. But compare with these the\r\ndemoralizing dogmas of Calvin.\r\n\r\n1. That there are three Gods.\r\n\r\n2. That good works, or the love of our neighbor, are nothing.\r\n\r\n3. That faith is everything, and the more incomprehensible the\r\nproposition, the more merit in its faith.\r\n\r\n4. That reason in religion is of unlawful use.\r\n\r\n5. That God, from the beginning, elected certain individuals to be\r\nsaved, and certain others to be damned; and that no crimes of the former\r\ncan damn them; no virtues of the latter, save.\r\n\r\nNow, which of these is the true and charitable Christian? He who\r\nbelieves and acts on the simple doctrines of Jesus; or the impious\r\ndogmatists, as Athanasius and Calvin? Verily I say these are the false\r\nshepherds foretold as to enter not by the door into the sheepfold, but\r\nto climb up some other way. They are mere usurpers of the Christian\r\nname, teaching a counter-religion made up of the deliria of crazy\r\nimaginations, as foreign from Christianity as is that of Mahomet. Their\r\nblasphemies have driven thinking men into infidelity, who have too\r\nhastily rejected the supposed author himself, with the horrors so\r\nfalsely imputed to him. Had the doctrines of Jesus been preached always\r\nas pure as they came from his lips, the whole civilized world would\r\nnow have been Christian. I rejoice that in this blessed country of free\r\ninquiry and belief, which has surrendered its creed and conscience\r\nto neither kings nor priests, the genuine doctrine of one only God is\r\nreviving, and I trust that there is not a young man now living in the\r\nUnited States, who will not die an Unitarian.\r\n\r\nBut much I fear, that when this great truth shall be re-established, its\r\nvotaries will fall into the fatal error of fabricating formulas of\r\ncreed and confessions of faith, the engines which so soon destroyed the\r\nreligion of Jesus, and made of Christendom a mere Aceldama; that they\r\nwill give up morals for mysteries, and Jesus for Plato. How much wiser\r\nare the Quakers, who, agreeing in the fundamental doctrines of the\r\nGospel, schismatize about no mysteries, and, keeping within the pale\r\nof common sense, suffer no speculative differences of opinion, any\r\nmore than of feature, to impair the love of their brethren. Be this the\r\nwisdom of Unitarians, this the holy mantle which shall cover within its\r\ncharitable circumference all who believe in one God, and who love their\r\nneighbor! I conclude my sermon with sincere assurances of my friendly\r\nesteem and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXIII.--TO JOHN ADAMS\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nMonticello, June 27, 1822.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour kind letter of the 11th has given me great satisfaction. For\r\nalthough I could not doubt but that the hand of age was pressing heavily\r\non you, as on myself, yet we like to know the particulars and the\r\ndegree of that pressure. Much reflection, too, has been produced by\r\nyour suggestion of lending my letter of the 1st, to a printer. I have\r\ngenerally great aversion to the insertion of my letters in the public\r\npapers; because of my passion for quiet retirement, and never to be\r\nexhibited in scene on the public stage. Nor am I unmindful of the\r\nprecept of Horace, ‘_Solve senescentem, mature sanus, equum, ne\r\npeccet ad extremum ridendus_.’ In the present case, however, I see a\r\npossibility that this might aid in producing the very quiet after\r\nwhich I pant. I do not know how far you may suffer, as I do, under the\r\npersecution of letters, of which every mail brings a fresh load.\r\nThey are letters of inquiry, for the most part, always of good will,\r\nsometimes from friends whom I esteem, but much oftener from persons\r\nwhose names are unknown to me, but written kindly and civilly, and to\r\nwhich, therefore, civility requires answers. Perhaps, the better known\r\nfailure of your hand in its function of writing, may shield you in\r\ngreater degree from this distress, and so far qualify the misfortune of\r\nits disability. I happened to turn to my letter-list some time ago, and\r\na curiosity was excited to count those received in a single year. It\r\nwas the year before the last. I found the number to be one thousand two\r\nhundred and sixty-seven, many of them requiring answers of elaborate\r\nresearch, and all to be answered with due attention and consideration.\r\nTake an average of this number for a week or a day, and I will repeat\r\nthe question suggested by other considerations in mine of the 1st. Is\r\nthis life? At best it is but the life of a mill-horse, who sees no\r\nend to his circle but in death. To such a life, that of a cabbage is\r\nparadise. It occurs, then, that my condition of existence, truly stated\r\nin that letter, if better known, might check the kind indiscretions\r\nwhich are so heavily oppressing the departing hours of life. Such a\r\nrelief would, to me, be an ineffable blessing. But yours of the 11th,\r\nequally interesting and affecting, should accompany that to which it is\r\nan answer. The two, taken together, would excite a joint interest, and\r\nplace before our fellow-citizens the present condition of two ancient\r\nservants, who, having faithfully performed their forty or fifty\r\ncampaigns, _stipendiis omnibus expletis_, have a reasonable claim\r\nto repose from all disturbance in the sanctuary of invalids and\r\nsuperannuates. But some device should be thought of for their getting\r\nbefore the public otherwise than by our own publication. Your printer,\r\nperhaps, could frame something plausible, ------‘s name, should be left\r\nblank, as his picture, should it meet his eye, might give him pain. I\r\nconsign, however, the whole subject to your consideration, to do in it\r\nwhatever your own judgment shall approve, and repeat always, with truth,\r\nthe assurance of my constant and affectionate friendship and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXIV.--TO WILLIAM T. BARRY, July 2, 1822\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM T. BARRY.\r\n\r\nMonticello, July 2, 1822.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of the 15th of June is received, and I am very thankful for\r\nthe kindness of its expressions respecting myself. But it ascribes to me\r\nmerits which I do not claim. I was only of a band devoted to the cause\r\nof independence, all of whom exerted equally their best endeavors for\r\nits success, and have a common right to the merits of its acquisition.\r\nSo also in the civil revolution of 1801. Very many and very meritorious\r\nwere the worthy patriots who assisted in bringing back our government\r\nto its republican tack. To preserve it in that will require unremitting\r\nvigilance. Whether the surrender of our opponents, their reception into\r\nour camp, their assumption of our name, and apparent accession to\r\nour objects, may strengthen or weaken the genuine principles of\r\nrepublicanism, may be a good or an evil, is yet to be seen. I consider\r\nthe party division of whig and tory the most wholesome which can exist\r\nin any government, and well worthy of being nourished, to keep out those\r\nof a more dangerous character. We already see the power, installed\r\nfor life, responsible to no authority (for impeachment is not even a\r\nscare-crow), advancing with a noiseless and steady pace to the great\r\nobject of consolidation. The foundations are already deeply laid by\r\ntheir decisions, for the annihilation of constitutional State rights,\r\nand the removal of every check, every counterpoise to the ingulphing*\r\npower of which themselves are to make a sovereign part. If ever this\r\nvast country is brought under a single government, it will be one of the\r\nmost extensive corruption, indifferent and incapable of a wholesome care\r\nover so wide a spread of surface. This will not be borne, and you will\r\nhave to choose between reformation and revolution. If I know the spirit\r\nof this country, the one or the other is inevitable. Before the canker\r\nis become inveterate, before its venom has reached so much of the body\r\npolitic as to get beyond control, remedy should be applied. Let the\r\nfuture appointments of judges be for four or six years, and renewable\r\nby the President and Senate. This will bring their conduct, at regular\r\nperiods, under revision and probation, and may keep them in equipoise\r\nbetween the general and special governments. We have erred in this\r\npoint, by copying England, where certainly it is a good thing to have\r\nthe judges independent of the King. But we have omitted to copy their\r\ncaution also, which makes a judge removable on the address of\r\nboth legislative Houses. That there should be public functionaries\r\nindependent of the nation, whatever may be their demerit, is a solecism\r\nin a republic, of the first order of absurdity and inconsistency.\r\n\r\nTo the printed inquiries respecting our schools, it is not in my\r\npower to give an answer. Age, debility, an ancient dislocated, and now\r\nstiffened wrist, render writing so slow and painful, that I am obliged\r\nto decline every thing possible requiring writing. An act of our\r\nlegislature will inform you of our plan of primary schools, and the\r\nannual reports show that it is becoming completely abortive, and must\r\nbe abandoned very shortly, after costing us to this day one hundred and\r\neighty thousand dollars, and yet to cost us forty-five thousand dollars\r\na year more until it shall be discontinued; and if a single boy has\r\nreceived the elements of common education, it must be in some part of\r\nthe country not known to me. Experience has but too fully confirmed the\r\nearly predictions of its fate. But on this subject I must refer you\r\nto others more able than I am to go into the necessary details; and I\r\nconclude with the assurances of my great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXV.--TO DOCTOR WATERHOUSE, July 19, 1822\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR WATERHOUSE.\r\n\r\nMonticello, July 19, 1822.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nAn anciently dislocated, and now stiffening wrist, makes writing an\r\noperation so slow and painful to me, that I should not so soon have\r\ntroubled you with an acknowledgment of your favor of the 8th, but for\r\nthe request it contained of my consent to the publication of my letter\r\nof June the 26th. No, my dear Sir, not for the world. Into what a nest\r\nof hornets would it thrust my head! the _genus irritabile vatum_, on\r\nwhom argument is lost, and reason is, by themselves, disclaimed in\r\nmatters of religion. Don Quixote undertook to redress the bodily\r\nwrongs of the world, but the redressment of mental vagaries would be an\r\nenterprise more than Quixotic. I should as soon undertake to bring the\r\ncrazy skulls of Bedlam to sound understanding, as inculcate reason into\r\nthat of an Athanasian. I am old, and tranquillity is now my _summum\r\nbonum_. Keep me, therefore, from the fire and faggots of Calvin and his\r\nvictim Servetus. Happy in the prospect of a restoration of primitive\r\nChristianity, I must leave to younger athletes to encounter and lop off\r\nthe false branches which have been engrafted into it by the mycologists\r\nof the middle and modern ages. I am not aware of the peculiar resistance\r\nto Unitarianism, which you ascribe to Pennsylvania. When I lived in\r\nPhiladelphia there was a respectable congregation of that sect, with a\r\nmeeting-house and regular service which I attended, and in which Doctor\r\nPriestley officiated to numerous audiences. Baltimore has one or two\r\nchurches, and their pastor, author of an inestimable book on this\r\nsubject, was elected chaplain to the late Congress. That doctrine has\r\nnot yet been preached to us: but the breeze begins to be felt which\r\nprecedes the storm; and fanaticism is all in a bustle, shutting its\r\ndoors and windows to keep it out. But it will come, and drive before it\r\nthe foggy mists of Platonism which have so long obscured our atmosphere.\r\nI am in hopes that some of the disciples of your institution will become\r\nmissionaries to us, of these doctrines truly evangelical, and open our\r\neyes to what has been so long hidden from them. A bold and eloquent\r\npreacher would be no where listened to with more freedom than in this\r\nState, nor with more firmness of mind. They might need a preparatory\r\ndiscourse on the text of ‘Prove all things, hold fast that which is\r\ngood,’ in order to unlearn the lesson that reason is an unlawful guide\r\nin religion. They might startle on being first awaked from the dreams of\r\nthe night, but they would rub their eyes at once, and look the spectres\r\nboldly in the face. The preacher might be excluded by our hierophants\r\nfrom their churches and meeting-houses, but would be attended in\r\nthe fields by whole acres of hearers and thinkers. Missionaries from\r\nCambridge would soon be greeted with more welcome, than from the\r\ntritheistical school of Andover. Such are my wishes, such would be my\r\nwelcomes, warm and cordial as the assurances of my esteem and respect\r\nfor you.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXVI.--TO JOHN ADAMS\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nMonticello, November 1, 1822.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have racked my memory and ransacked my papers, to enable myself to\r\nanswer the inquiries of your favor of October the 15th; but to little\r\npurpose. My papers furnish me nothing, my memory, generalities only.\r\nI know that while I was in Europe, and anxious about the fate of our\r\nseafaring men, for some of whom, then in captivity in Algiers, we were\r\ntreating, and all were in like danger, I formed, undoubtingly, the\r\nopinion that our government, as soon as practicable, should provide a\r\nnaval force sufficient to keep the Barbary States in order; and on this\r\nsubject we communicated together, as you observe. When I returned to\r\nthe United States and took part in the administration under General\r\nWashington, I constantly maintained that opinion; and in December, 1790,\r\ntook advantage of a reference to me from the first Congress which met\r\nafter I was in office, to report in favor of a force sufficient for\r\nthe protection of our Mediterranean commerce; and I laid before them\r\nan accurate statement of the whole Barbary force, public and private.\r\nI think General Washington approved of building vessels of war to that\r\nextent. General Knox, I know, did. But what was Colonel Hamilton’s\r\nopinion, I do not in the least remember. Your recollections on that\r\nsubject are certainly corroborated by his known anxieties for a close\r\nconnection with Great Britain, to which he might apprehend danger from\r\ncollisions between their vessels and ours. Randolph was then Attorney\r\nGeneral; but his opinion on the question I also entirely forget. Some\r\nvessels of war were accordingly built and sent into the Mediterranean.\r\nThe additions to these in your time, I need not note to you, who\r\nare well known to have ever been an advocate for the wooden walls\r\nof Themistocles. Some of those you added, were sold under an act of\r\nCongress passed while you were in office. I thought, afterwards, that\r\nthe public safety might require some additional vessels of strength,\r\nto be prepared and in readiness for the first moment of a war, provided\r\nthey could be preserved against the decay which is unavoidable if kept\r\nin the water, and clear of the expense of officers and men. With this\r\nview I proposed that they should be built in dry docks, above the level\r\nof the tide waters, and covered with roofs. I further advised, that\r\nplaces for these docks should be selected where there was a command of\r\nwater on a high level, as that of the Tiber at Washington, by which\r\nthe vessels might be floated out, on the principle of a lock. But the\r\nmajority of the legislature was against any addition to the navy,\r\nand the minority, although for it in judgment, voted against it on a\r\nprinciple of opposition. We are now, I understand, building vessels to\r\nremain on the stocks, under shelter, until wanted, when they will be\r\nlaunched and finished. On my plan they could be in service at an hour’s\r\nnotice. On this, the finishing, after launching, will be a work of time.\r\n\r\nThis is all I recollect about the origin and progress of our navy. That\r\nof the late war, certainly raised our rank and character among nations.\r\nYet a navy is a very expensive engine. It is admitted, that in ten or\r\ntwelve years a vessel goes to entire decay; or, if kept in repair, costs\r\nas much as would build a new one: and that a nation who could count on\r\ntwelve or fifteen years’ of peace, would gain by burning its navy and\r\nbuilding a new one in time. Its extent, therefore, must be governed by\r\ncircumstances. Since my proposition for a force adequate to the piracies\r\nof the Mediterranean, a similar necessity has arisen in our own seas\r\nfor considerable addition to that force. Indeed, I wish we could have\r\na convention with the naval powers of Europe, for them to keep down\r\nthe pirates of the Mediterranean, and the slave ships on the coast of\r\nAfrica, and for us to perform the same duties for the society of nations\r\nin our seas. In this way, those collisions would be avoided between the\r\nvessels of war of different nations, which beget wars and constitute the\r\nweightiest objection to navies. I salute you with constant affection and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n     [The annexed is the letter to which the foregoing is a reply.]\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\nMontezillo, October 15, 1822. Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have long entertained scruples about writing this letter, upon a\r\nsubject of some delicacy. But old age has overcome them at last.\r\n\r\nYou remember the four ships ordered by Congress to be built, and the\r\nfour captains appointed by Washington, Talbot, and Truxton, and Barry,\r\n&c, to carry an ambassador to Algiers, and protect our commerce in the\r\nMediterranean. I have always imputed this measure to you; for several\r\nreasons. First, because you frequently proposed it to me while we\r\nwere at Paris, negotiating together for peace with the Barbary powers.\r\nSecondly, because I knew that Washington and Hamilton were not only\r\nindifferent about a navy, but averse to it. There was no Secretary of\r\nthe Navy; only four Heads of department. You were Secretary of State;\r\nHamilton, Secretary of the Treasury; Knox, Secretary of War; and I\r\nbelieve Bradford was Attorney General. I have always suspected that you\r\nand Knox were in favor of a navy. If Bradford was so, the majority was\r\nclear. But Washington, I am confident, was against it in his judgment.\r\nBut his attachment to Knox, and his deference to your opinion, for I\r\nknow he had a great regard for you, might induce him to decide in favor\r\nof you and Knox, even though Bradford united with Hamilton in opposition\r\nto you. That Hamilton was averse to the measure, I have personal\r\nevidence; for while it was pending, he came in a hurry and a fit of\r\nimpatience to make a visit to me. He said, he was likely to be called\r\nupon for a large sum of money to build ships of war, to fight the\r\nAlgerines, and he asked my opinion of the measure. I answered him that\r\nI was clearly in favor of it. For I had always been of opinion, from the\r\ncommencement of the Revolution, that a navy was the most powerful, the\r\nsafest, and the cheapest national defence for this country. My advice,\r\ntherefore, was, that as much of the revenue as could possibly be\r\nspared, should be applied to the building and equipping of ships. The\r\nconversation was of some length, but it was manifest in his looks and in\r\nhis air, that he was disgusted at the measure, as well as at the opinion\r\nthat I had expressed.\r\n\r\nMrs. Knox not long since wrote a letter to Doctor Waterhouse, requesting\r\nhim to procure a commision for her son, in the navy; ‘that navy,’ says\r\nher ladyship, ‘of which his father was the parent.’ ‘For,’ says she, ‘I\r\nhave frequently heard General Washington say to my husband, the navy was\r\nyour child.’ I have always believed it to be Jefferson’s child, though\r\nKnox may have assisted in ushering it into the world. Hamilton’s hobby\r\nwas the army. That Washington was averse to a navy, I had full proof\r\nfrom his own lips, in many different conversations, some of them of\r\nlength, in which he always insisted that it was only building and\r\narming ships for the English. ‘_Si quid novisti rectius istis, candidus\r\nimperii; si non, his utere mecum_.’\r\n\r\nIf I am in error in any particular, pray correct your humble servant.\r\n\r\nJohn Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXVII.--TO DOCTOR COOPER, November 2, 1822\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR COOPER.\r\n\r\nMonticello, November 2, 1822.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of October the 18th came to hand yesterday. The atmosphere\r\nof our country is unquestionably charged with a threatening cloud of\r\nfanaticism, lighter in some parts, denser in others, but too heavy\r\nin all. I had no idea, however, that in Pennsylvania, the cradle of\r\ntoleration and freedom of religion, it could have arisen to the height\r\nyou describe. This must be owing to the growth of Presbyterianism.\r\nThe blasphemy and absurdity of the five points of Calvin, and the\r\nimpossibility of defending them, render their advocates impatient of\r\nreasoning, irritable, and prone to denunciation. In Boston, however, and\r\nits neighborhood, Unitarianism has advanced to so great strength, as now\r\nto humble this haughtiest of all religious sects; insomuch, that they\r\ncondescend to interchange with them and the other sects, the civilities\r\nof preaching freely and frequently in each other’s meeting-houses. In\r\nRhode Island, on the other hand, no sectarian preacher will permit an\r\nUnitarian to pollute his desk. In our Richmond there is much fanaticism,\r\nbut chiefly among the women. They have their night meetings and praying\r\nparties, where, attended by their priests, and sometimes by a hen-pecked\r\nhusband, they pour forth the effusions of their love to Jesus, in terms\r\nas amatory and carnal, as their modesty would permit them to use to a\r\nmere earthly lover. In our village of Charlottesville, there is a good\r\ndegree of religion, with a small spice only of fanaticism. We have four\r\nsects, but without either church or meeting-house. The court-house is\r\nthe common temple, one Sunday in the month to each. Here, Episcopalian\r\nand Presbyterian, Methodist and Baptist, meet together, join in\r\nhymning their Maker, listen with attention and devotion to each others’\r\npreachers, and all mix in society with perfect harmony. It is not so in\r\nthe districts where Presbyterianism prevails undividedly. Their ambition\r\nand tyranny would tolerate no rival, if they had power. Systematical\r\nin grasping at an ascendancy over all other sects, they aim, like the\r\nJesuits, at engrossing the education of the country, are hostile to\r\nevery institution which they do not direct, and jealous at seeing others\r\nbegin to attend at all to that object. The diffusion of instruction, to\r\nwhich there is now so growing an attention, will be the remote remedy\r\nto this fever of fanaticism; while the more proximate one will be the\r\nprogress of Unitarianism. That this will, ere long, be the religion of\r\nthe majority from north to south, I have no doubt.\r\n\r\nIn our University you know there is no professorship of Divinity. A\r\nhandle has been made of this, to disseminate an idea that this is\r\nan institution, not merely of no religion, but against all religion.\r\nOccasion was taken at the last meeting of the Visitors, to bring forward\r\nan idea that might silence this calumny, which weighed on the minds\r\nof some honest friends to the institution. In our annual report to the\r\nlegislature, after stating the constitutional reasons against a public\r\nestablishment of any religious instruction, we suggest the expediency of\r\nencouraging the different religious sects to establish, each for itself,\r\na professorship of their own tenets, on the confines of the University,\r\nso near as that the students may attend the lectures there, and have\r\nthe free use our own library, and every other accommodation we can give\r\nthem; preserving, however, their independence of us and of each other.\r\nThis fills the chasm objected to ours, as a defect in an institution\r\nprofessing to give instruction in all useful sciences. I think the\r\ninvitation will be accepted, by some sects from candid intentions,\r\nand by others from jealousy and rivalship. And by bringing the sects\r\ntogether, and mixing them with the mass of other students, we shall\r\nsoften their asperities, liberalize and neutralize their prejudices, and\r\nmake the general religion, a religion of peace, reason, and morality.\r\n\r\nThe time of opening our University is still as uncertain as ever. All\r\nthe pavilions, boarding-houses, and dormitories are done. Nothing is\r\nnow wanting but the central building for a library and other general\r\npurposes. For this we have no funds, and the last legislature refused\r\nall aid. We have better hopes of the next. But all is uncertain. I have\r\nheard with regret of disturbances on the part of the students in your\r\nseminary. The article of discipline is the most difficult in American\r\neducation. Premature ideas of independence, too little repressed by\r\nparents, beget a spirit of insubordination, which is the great obstacle\r\nto science with us, and a principal cause of its decay since the\r\nRevolution. I look to it with dismay in our institution, as a breaker\r\nahead, which I am far from being confident we shall be able to weather.\r\nThe advance of age, and tardy pace of the public patronage, may probably\r\nspare me the pain of witnessing consequences.\r\n\r\nI salute you with constant friendship and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXVIII.--TO JAMES SMITH, December 8, 1822\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES SMITH.\r\n\r\nMonticello, December 8, 1822.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have to thank you for your pamphlets on the subject of Unitarianism,\r\nand to express my gratification with your efforts for the revival of\r\nprimitive Christianity in your quarter. No historical fact is better\r\nestablished, than that the doctrine of one God, pure and uncompounded,\r\nwas that of the early ages of Christianity; and was amoung the\r\nefficacious doctrines which gave it triumph over the polytheism of the\r\nancients, sickened with the absurdities of their own theology. Nor was\r\nthe unity of the Supreme Being ousted from the Christian creed by the\r\nforce of reason, but by the sword of civil government, wielded at the\r\nwill of the fanatic Athanasius. The hocus-pocus phantasm of a God like\r\nanother Cerberus, with one body and three heads, had its birth and\r\ngrowth in the blood of thousands and thousands of martyrs. And a strong\r\nproof of the solidity of the primitive faith, is its restoration,\r\nas soon as a nation arises which vindicates to itself the freedom of\r\nreligious opinion, and its external divorce from the civil authority.\r\nThe pure and simple unity of the Creator of the universe, is now all\r\nbut ascendant in the eastern States; it is dawning in the west, and\r\nadvancing towards the south; and I confidently expect that the present\r\ngeneration will see Unitarianism become the general religion of the\r\nUnited States. The eastern presses are giving us many excellent pieces\r\non the subject, and Priestley’s learned writings on it are, or should\r\nbe, in every hand. In fact, the Athanasian paradox that one is three,\r\nand three but one, is so incomprehensible to the human mind, that no\r\ncandid man can say he has any idea of it, and how can he believe what\r\npresents no idea? He who thinks he does, only deceives himself. He\r\nproves, also, that man, once surrendering his reason, has no remaining\r\nguard against absurdities the most monstrous, and like a ship without\r\nrudder, is the sport of every wind. With such persons, gullability,\r\nwhich they call faith, takes the helm from the hand of reason, and the\r\nmind becomes a wreck.\r\n\r\nI write with freedom, because, while I claim a right to believe in\r\none God, if so my reason tells me, I yield as freely to others that of\r\nbelieving in three. Both religions, I find, make honest men, and that\r\nis the only point society has any right to look to. Although this mutual\r\nfreedom should produce mutual indulgence, yet I wish not to be brought\r\nin question before the public on this or any other subject, and I\r\npray you to consider me as writing under that trust. I take no part\r\nin controversies, religious or political. At the age of eighty,\r\ntranquillity is the greatest good of life, and the strongest of our\r\ndesires that of dying in the good-will of all mankind. And with the\r\nassurances of all my good-will to Unitarian and Trinitarian, to Whig and\r\nTory, accept for yourself that of my entire respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER, CLXIX.--TO JOHN ADAMS, February 25, 1823\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS,\r\n\r\nMonticello, February 25, 1823.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI received, in due time, your two favors of December the 2nd and\r\nFebruary the 10th, and have to acknowledge for the ladies of my native\r\nState their obligations to you for the encomiums which you are so kind\r\nas to bestow on them. They certainly claim no advantages over those of\r\ntheir sister States, and are sensible of more favorable circumstances\r\nexisting with many of them, and happily availed, which our situation\r\ndoes not offer. But the paper respecting Monticello, to which you\r\nallude, was not written by a Virginian, but a visitant from another\r\nState; and written by memory at least a dozen years after the visit.\r\nThis has occasioned some lapses of recollection, and a confusion of some\r\nthings in the mind of our friend, and particularly as to the volume of\r\nslanders supposed to have been cut out of newspapers and preserved. It\r\nwould not, indeed, have been a single volume, but an Encyclopaedia in\r\nbulk. But I never had such a volume; indeed, I rarely thought those\r\nlibels worth reading, much less preserving and remembering. At the end\r\nof every year, I generally sorted all my pamphlets, and had them bound\r\naccording to their subjects. One of these volumes consisted of personal\r\naltercations between individuals, and calumnies on each other. This\r\nwas lettered on the back, ‘Personalities,’ and is now in the library of\r\nCongress. I was in the habit, also, while living apart from my family,\r\nof cutting out of the newspapers such morsels of poetry, or tales, as\r\nI thought would please, and of sending them to my grandchildren, who\r\npasted them on leaves of blank paper and formed them into a book. These\r\ntwo volumes have been confounded into one in the recollection of our\r\nfriend. Her poetical imagination, too, has heightened the scenes she\r\nvisited, as well as the merits of the inhabitants, to whom her society\r\nwas a delightful gratification.\r\n\r\nI have just finished reading O’Meara’s Bonaparte. It places him in a\r\nhigher scale of understanding than I had allotted him. I had thought him\r\nthe greatest of all military captains, but an indifferent statesman, and\r\nmisled by unworthy passions. The flashes, however, which escaped\r\nfrom him in these conversations with O’Meara, prove a mind of great\r\nexpansion, although not of distinct developement and reasoning. He\r\nseizes results with rapidity and penetration, but never explains\r\nlogically the process of reasoning by which he arrives at them. This\r\nbook, too, makes us forget his atrocities for a moment, in commiseration\r\nof his sufferings. I will not say that the authorities of the world,\r\ncharged with the care of their country and people, had not a right\r\nto confine him for life, as a lion or tiger, on the principles of\r\nself-preservation. There was no safety to nations while he was permitted\r\nto roam at large. But the putting him to death in cold blood, by\r\nlingering tortures of mind, by vexations, insults, and deprivations, was\r\na degree of inhumanity to which the poisonings and assassinations of the\r\nschool of Borgia and the den of Marat never attained. The book proves,\r\nalso, that nature had denied him the moral sense, the first excellence\r\nof well-organized man. If he could seriously and repeatedly affirm, that\r\nhe had raised himself to power without ever having committed a crime, it\r\nproves that he wanted totally the sense of right and wrong. If he could\r\nconsider the millions of human lives which he had destroyed or caused to\r\nbe destroyed, the desolations of countries by plunderings, burnings,\r\nand famine, the destitutions of lawful rulers of the world without the\r\nconsent of their constituents, to place his brothers and sisters on\r\ntheir thrones, the cutting up of established societies of men and\r\njumbling them discordantly together again at his caprice, the demolition\r\nof the fairest hopes of mankind for the recovery of their rights and\r\namelioration of their condition, and all the numberless train of his\r\nother enormities; the man, I say, who could consider all these as no\r\ncrimes, must have been a moral monster, against whom every hand should\r\nhave been lifted to slay him.\r\n\r\nYou are so kind as to inquire after my health. The bone of my arm is\r\nwell knitted, but my hand and fingers are in a discouraging condition,\r\nkept entirely useless by an oedematous swelling of slow amendment.\r\n\r\nGod bless you and continue your good health of body and mind.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXX.--TO JOHN ADAMS, April 11, 1823\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nMonticello, April 11, 1823.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nThe wishes expressed in your last favor, that I may continue in life and\r\nhealth until I become a Calvinist, at least in his exclamation of, ‘_Mon\r\nDieu! jusqu’a quand?_’ would make me immortal. I can never join Calvin\r\nin addressing his God. He was indeed an atheist, which I can never be;\r\nor rather his religion was daemonism. If ever man worshipped a false\r\nGod, he did. The being described in his five points, is not the God whom\r\nyou and I acknowledge and adore, the Creator and benevolent Governor of\r\nthe world; but a daemon of malignant spirit. It would be more pardonable\r\nto believe in no God at all, than to blaspheme him by the atrocious\r\nattributes of Calvin. Indeed, I think that every Christian sect gives\r\na great handle to atheism by their general dogma, that, without a\r\nrevelation, there would not be sufficient proof of the being of a God.\r\nNow one sixth of mankind only are supposed to be Christians: the\r\nother five sixths then, who do not believe in the Jewish and Christian\r\nrevelation, are without a knowledge of the existence of a God! This\r\ngives completely a _gain de cause_ to the disciples of Ocellus, Timasus,\r\nSpinosa, Diderot, and D’Holbach. The argument which they rest on as\r\ntriumphant and unanswerable is, that in every hypothesis of cosmogony,\r\nyou must admit an eternal pre-existence of something; and according to\r\nthe rule of sound philosophy, you are never to employ two principles to\r\nsolve a difficulty when one will suffice. They say then, that it is more\r\nsimple to believe at once in the eternal pre-existence of the world,\r\nas it is now going on, and may for ever go on by the principle of\r\nreproduction which we see and witness, than to believe in the eternal\r\npre-existence of an ulterior cause, or creator of the world, a being\r\nwhom we see not and know not, of whose form, substance, and mode, or\r\nplace of existence, or of action, no sense informs us, no power of the\r\nmind enables us to delineate or comprehend. On the contrary, I hold\r\n(without appeal to revelation), that when we take a view of the\r\nuniverse, in its parts, general or particular, it is impossible for the\r\nhuman mind not to perceive and feel a conviction of design, consummate\r\nskill, and indefinite power in every atom of its composition. The\r\nmovements of the heavenly bodies, so exactly held in their course by\r\nthe balance of centrifugal and centripetal forces; the structure of our\r\nearth itself, with its distribution of lands, waters, and atmosphere;\r\nanimal and vegetable bodies, examined in all their minutest particles;\r\ninsects, mere atoms of life, yet as perfectly organized as man or\r\nmammoth; the mineral substances, their generation and uses; it is\r\nimpossible, I say, for the human mind not to believe, that there is\r\nin all this, design, cause, and effect, up to an ultimate cause, a\r\nfabricator of all things from matter and motion, their preserver and\r\nregulator while permitted to exist in their present forms, and their\r\nregenerator into new and other forms. We see, too, evident proofs of\r\nthe necessity of a superintending power, to maintain the universe in\r\nits course and order. Stars, well known, have disappeared, new ones have\r\ncome into view; comets, in their incalculable courses, may run foul of\r\nsuns and planets, and require renovation under other laws; certain races\r\nof animals are become extinct; and were there no restoring power, all\r\nexistences might extinguish successively, one by one, until all should\r\nbe reduced to a shapeless chaos. So irresistible are these evidences of\r\nan intelligent and powerful agent, that, of the infinite numbers of men\r\nwho have existed through all time, they have believed, in the proportion\r\nof a million at least to unit, in the hypothesis of an eternal\r\npre-existence of a creator, rather than in that of a self-existent\r\nuniverse. Surely this unanimous sentiment renders this more probable,\r\nthan that of the few in the other hypothesis. Some early Christians,\r\nindeed, have believed in the co-eternal pre-existence of both the\r\ncreator and the world, without changing their relation of cause and\r\neffect. That this was the opinion of St. Thomas, we are informed by\r\nCardinal Toleta, in these words; ‘_Deus ab terno fuit jam omnipotens,\r\nsi cut cum produxit mundum. Ah aternopotuit producers mundum. Si sol ah\r\nczterno esset, lumen ah æterno esset; et si pes, similiter vestigium.\r\nAt lumen et vestigium effectus sunt efficients solis et pedis; potuit\r\nergo cum causa æterna effectus coaternus esse. Cujus sententia, est S.\r\nThomas, theologorum primus_.’--Cardinal Toleta.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: page364]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: page365]\r\n\r\nOf the nature of this being we know nothing. Jesus tells us, that ‘God\r\nis a spirit’ (John iv. 24.), but without defining what a spirit is:\r\n[Greek phrase] Down to the third century, we know that it was still\r\ndeemed material but of a lighter, subtler matter than our gross bodies.\r\nSo says Origen; _Deus igitur, cui anima similis est, juxta Originem,\r\nreapte corporalis est; sed graviorum tantum ratione corporum\r\nincorporeus_.’ These are the words of Huet in his commentary on Origen.\r\nOrigen himself says, [Greek and Latin phrase]\r\n\r\nThese two fathers were of the third century. Calvin’s character of\r\nthis Supreme Being seems chiefly copied from that of the Jews. But the\r\nreformation of these blasphemous attributes, and substitution of those\r\nmore worthy, pure, and sublime, seems to have been the chief object of\r\nJesus in his discourses to the Jews: and his doctrine of the cosmogony\r\nof the world is very clearly laid down in the three first verses of\r\nthe first chapter of John, in these words: [Greek phrase] Which, truly\r\ntranslated, means, ‘In the beginning God existed, and reason [or mind]\r\nwas with God, and that mind was God. This was in the beginning with God.\r\nAll things were created by it, and without it was made not one thing\r\nwhich was made.’ Yet this text, so plainly declaring the doctrine of\r\nJesus, that the world was created by the supreme intelligent being, has\r\nbeen perverted by modern Christians to build up a second person of their\r\ntritheism, by a mistranslation of the word _Xoyog_. One of its legitimate\r\nmeanings, indeed, is ‘a word.’ But in that sense it makes an unmeaning\r\njargon: while the other meaning, ‘reason,’ equally legitimate, explains\r\nrationally the eternal pre-existence of God, and his creation of, the\r\nworld. Knowing how incomprehensible it was that ‘a word,’ the mere\r\naction or articulation of the organs of speech could create a world,\r\nthey undertook to make of this articulation a second pre-existing being,\r\nand ascribe to him, and not to God, the creation of the universe. The\r\natheist here plumes himself on the uselessness of such a God, and the\r\nsimpler hypothesis of a self-existent universe. The truth is, that the\r\ngreatest enemies to the doctrines of Jesus are those calling themselves\r\nthe expositors of them, who have perverted them for the structure of a\r\nsystem of fancy absolutely incomprehensible, and without any foundation\r\nin his genuine words. And the day will come, when the mystical\r\ngeneration of Jesus, by the Supreme Being as his father, in the womb of\r\na virgin, will be classed with the fable of the generation of Minerva\r\nin the brain of Jupiter. But we may hope that the dawn of reason,\r\nand freedom of thought, in these United States, will do away all this\r\nartificial scaffolding, and restore to us the primitive and genuine\r\ndoctrines of this the most venerated reformer of human errors.\r\n\r\nSo much for your quotation of Calvin’s ‘_Mon Dieu! jusqu’a quand_’ in\r\nwhich, when addressed to the God of Jesus, and our God, I join you\r\ncordially, and await his time and will with more readiness than\r\nreluctance. May we meet there again, in Congress, with our ancient\r\ncolleagues, and receive with them the seal of approbation, ‘Well done,\r\ngood and faithful servants.’\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXI.--TO THE PRESIDENT, June 11, 1823\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nMonticello, June 11, 1823.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nConsidering that I had not been to Bedford for a twelvemonth before,\r\nI thought myself singularly unfortunate in so timing my journey, as\r\nto have been absent exactly at the moment of your late visit to our\r\nneighborhood. The loss, indeed, was all my own; for in these short\r\ninterviews with you. I generally get my political compass rectified,\r\nlearn from you whereabouts we are, and correct my course again. In\r\nexchange for this, I can give you but newspaper ideas, and little indeed\r\nof these, for I read but a single paper, and that hastily. I find Horace\r\nand Tacitus so much better writers than the champions of the gazettes,\r\nthat I lay those down, to take up these, with great reluctance. And on\r\nthe question you propose, whether we can, in any form, take a bolder\r\nattitude than formerly in favor of liberty, I can give you but\r\ncommonplace ideas. They will be but the widow’s mite, and offered only\r\nbecause requested. The matter which now embroils Europe, the presumption\r\nof dictating to an independent nation the form of its government, is so\r\narrogant, so atrocious, that indignation, as well as moral sentiment,\r\nenlists all our partialities and prayers in favor of one, and our\r\nequal execrations against the other. I do not know, indeed, whether all\r\nnations do not owe to one another a bold and open declaration of their\r\nsympathies with the one party, and their detestation of the conduct of\r\nthe other. But farther than this we are not bound to go; and indeed, for\r\nthe sake of the world, we ought not to increase the jealousies, or draw\r\non ourselves the power, of this formidable confederacy. I have ever\r\ndeemed it fundamental for the United States, never to take active\r\npart in the quarrels of Europe. Their political interests are entirely\r\ndistinct from ours. Their mutual jealousies, their balance of power,\r\ntheir complicated alliances, their forms and principles of government,\r\nare all foreign to us. They are nations of eternal war. All their\r\nenergies are expended in the destruction of the labor, property, and\r\nlives of their people. On our part, never had a people so favorable\r\na chance of trying the opposite system, of peace and fraternity with\r\nmankind, and the direction of all our means and faculties to the\r\npurposes of improvement instead of destruction. With Europe we have\r\nfew occasions of collision, and these, with a little prudence and\r\nforbearance, may be generally accommodated. Of the brethren of our own\r\nhemisphere, none are yet, or for an age to come will be, in a shape,\r\ncondition, or disposition to war against us. And the foothold, which the\r\nnations of Europe had in either America, is slipping from under them,\r\nso that we shall soon be rid of their neighborhood. Cuba alone seems at\r\npresent to hold up a speck of war to us. Its possession by Great Britain\r\nwould indeed be a great calamity to us. Could we induce her to join us\r\nin guarantying its independence against all the world, except Spain, it\r\nwould be nearly as valuable to us as if it were our own. But should she\r\ntake it, I would not immediately go to war for it; because the first war\r\non other accounts will give it to us; or the island will give itself to\r\nus, when, able to do so. While no duty, therefore, calls on us to take\r\npart in the present war of Europe, and a golden harvest offers itself in\r\nreward for doing nothing, peace and neutrality seem to be our duty and\r\ninterest. We may gratify ourselves, indeed, with a neutrality as partial\r\nto Spain as would be justifiable without giving cause of war to her\r\nadversary; we might and ought to avail ourselves of the happy occasion\r\nof procuring and cementing a cordial reconciliation with her, by\r\ngiving assurance of every friendly office which neutrality admits, and\r\nespecially, against all apprehension of our intermeddling in the quarrel\r\nwith her colonies. And I expect daily and confidently to hear of a spark\r\nkindled in France, which will employ her at home, and relieve Spain from\r\nall further apprehensions of danger.\r\n\r\nThat England is playing false with Spain cannot be doubted. Her\r\ngovernment is looking one way and rowing another. It is curious to look\r\nback a little on past events. During the ascendancy of Bonaparte, the\r\nword among the herd of Kings was, ‘_Sauve qui peut_.’ Each shifted\r\nfor himself, and left his brethren to squander and do the same as they\r\ncould. After the battle of Waterloo, and the military possession of\r\nFrance, they rallied and combined in common cause, to maintain each\r\nother against any similar and future danger. And in this alliance,\r\nLouis, now avowedly, and George, secretly but solidly, were of the\r\ncontracting parties; and there can be no doubt that the allies are bound\r\nby treaty to aid England with their armies, should insurrection take\r\nplace among her people. The coquetry she is now playing off between\r\nher people and her allies is perfectly understood by the latter,\r\nand accordingly gives no apprehensions to France, to whom it is all\r\nexplained. The diplomatic correspondence she is now displaying, these\r\ndouble papers fabricated merely for exhibition, in which she makes\r\nherself talk of morals and principle, as if her qualms of conscience\r\nwould not permit her to go all lengths with her Holy Allies, are all to\r\ngull her own people. It is a theatrical farce, in which the five powers\r\nare the actors, England the Tartuffe, and her people the dupes. Playing\r\nthus so dextrously into each other’s hands, and their own persons\r\nseeming secured, they are now looking to their privileged orders.\r\nThese faithful auxiliaries, or accomplices, must be saved. This war is\r\nevidently that of the general body of the aristocracy, in which England\r\nis also acting her part. ‘Save but the Nobles, and there shall be no\r\nwar,’ says she, masking her measures at the same time under the form of\r\nfriendship and mediation, and hypocritically, while a party, offering\r\nherself as a judge, to betray those whom she is not permitted openly to\r\noppose. A fraudulent neutrality, if neutrality at all, is all Spain will\r\nget from her. And Spain, probably, perceives this, and willingly winks\r\nat it rather than have her weight thrown openly into the other scale.\r\n\r\nBut I am going beyond my text, and sinning against the adage of carrying\r\ncoals to Newcastle. In hazarding to you my crude and uninformed notions\r\nof things beyond my cognizance, only be so good as to remember that it\r\nis at your request, and with as little confidence on my part as profit\r\non yours. You will do what is right, leaving the people of Europe to act\r\ntheir follies and crimes among themselves, while we pursue in good faith\r\nthe paths of peace and prosperity. To your judgment we are willingly\r\nresigned, with sincere assurances of affectionate esteem and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXII.--TO JUDGE JOHNSON, June 12, 1823\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JUDGE JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nMonticello, June 12, 1823.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nOur correspondence is of that accommodating character, which admits of\r\nsuspension at the convenience of either party, without inconvenience to\r\nthe other. Hence this tardy acknowledgment of your favor of April the\r\n11th. I learn from that with great pleasure, that you have resolved on\r\ncontinuing your history of parties. Our opponents are far ahead of us in\r\npreparations for placing their cause favorably before posterity. Yet\r\nI hope even from some of them the escape of precious truths, in angry\r\nexplosions or effusions of vanity, which will betray the genuine\r\nmonarchism of their principles. They do not themselves believe what\r\nthey endeavor to inculcate, that we were an opposition party, not on\r\nprinciple, but merely seeking for office. The fact is, that at the\r\nformation of our government, many had formed their political opinions\r\non European writings and practices, believing the experience of old\r\ncountries, and especially of England, abusive as it was, to be a safer\r\nguide than mere theory. The doctrines of Europe were, that men in\r\nnumerous associations cannot be restrained within the limits of order\r\nand justice, but by forces physical and moral, wielded over them by\r\nauthorities independent of their will. Hence their organization of\r\nkings, hereditary nobles, and priests. Still further to constrain the\r\nbrute force of the people, they deem it necessary to keep them down by\r\nhard labor, poverty, and ignorance, and to take from them, as from bees,\r\nso much of their earnings, as that unremitting labor shall be necessary\r\nto obtain a sufficient surplus barely to sustain a scanty and miserable\r\nlife. And these earnings they apply to maintain their privileged orders\r\nin splendor and idleness, to fascinate the eyes of the people, and\r\nexcite in them an humble adoration and submission, as to an order of\r\nsuperior beings. Although few among us had gone all these lengths of\r\nopinion, yet many had advanced, some more, some less, on the way. And in\r\nthe convention which formed our government, they endeavored to draw\r\nthe cords of power as tight as they could obtain them, to lessen the\r\ndependence of the general functionaries on their constituents, to\r\nsubject to them those of the States, and to weaken their means of\r\nmaintaining the steady equilibrium which the majority of the convention\r\nhad deemed salutary for both branches, general and local. To recover,\r\ntherefore, in practice, the powers which the nation had refused, and to\r\nwarp to their own wishes those actually given, was the steady object of\r\nthe federal party. Ours, on the contrary, was to maintain the will\r\nof the majority of the convention, and of the people themselves. We\r\nbelieved, with them, that man was a rational animal, endowed by nature\r\nwith rights, and with an innate sense of justice; and that he could\r\nbe restrained from wrong and protected in right, by moderate powers,\r\nconfided to persons of his own choice, and held to their duties\r\nby dependence on his own will. We believed that the complicated\r\norganization of kings, nobles, and priests, was not the wisest nor best\r\nto effect the happiness of associated man; that wisdom and virtue were\r\nnot hereditary; that the trappings of such a machinery consumed, by\r\ntheir expense, those earnings of industry they were meant to protect,\r\nand, by the inequalities they produced, exposed liberty to sufferance.\r\nWe believed that men, enjoying in ease and security the full fruits of\r\ntheir own industry, enlisted by all their interests on the side of\r\nlaw and order, habituated to think for themselves, and to follow their\r\nreason as their guide, would be more easily and safely governed, than\r\nwith minds nourished in error, and vitiated and debased, as in Europe,\r\nby ignorance, indigence, and oppression. The cherishment of the people\r\nthen was our principle, the fear and distrust of them, that of the other\r\nparty. Composed, as we were, of the landed and laboring interests of the\r\ncountry, we could not be less anxious for a government of law and order\r\nthan were the inhabitants of the cities, the strong holds of federalism.\r\nAnd whether our efforts to save the principles and form of our\r\nconstitution have not been salutary, let the present republican freedom,\r\norder, and prosperity of our country determine. History may distort\r\ntruth, and will distort it for a time, by the superior efforts at\r\njustification of those who are conscious of needing it most. Nor will\r\nthe opening scenes of our present government be seen in their true\r\naspect, until the letters of the day, now held in private hoards, shall\r\nbe broken up and laid open to public view. What a treasure will be found\r\nin General Washington’s cabinet, when it shall pass into the hands of\r\nas candid a friend to truth as he was himself! When no longer, like\r\nCaesar’s notes and memorandums in the hands of Anthony, it shall be open\r\nto the high priests of federalism only, and garbled to say so much, and\r\nno more, as suits their views.\r\n\r\nWith respect to his Farewell Address, to the authorship of which, it\r\nseems, there are conflicting claims, I can state to you some facts. He\r\nhad determined to decline a re-election at the end of his first term,\r\nand so far determined, that he had requested Mr. Madison to prepare for\r\nhim something valedictory, to be addressed to his constituents on his\r\nretirement. This was done: but he was finally persuaded to acquiesce\r\nin a second election, to which no one more strenuously pressed him than\r\nmyself, from a conviction of the importance of strengthening, by longer\r\nhabit, the respect necessary for that office, which the weight of his\r\ncharacter only could effect. When, at the end of this second term, his\r\nValedictory came out, Mr. Madison recognised in it several passages of\r\nhis draught; several others we were both satisfied were from the pen\r\nof Hamilton, and others from that of the President himself. These he\r\nprobably put into the hands of Hamilton to form into a whole, and hence\r\nit may all appear in Hamilton’s hand-writing, as if it were all of his\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nI have stated above, that the original objects of the federalists were,\r\n1. To warp our government more to the form and principles of monarchy,\r\nand 2. To weaken the barriers of the State governments as co-ordinate\r\npowers. In the first they have been so completely foiled by the\r\nuniversal spirit of the nation, that they have abandoned the enterprise,\r\nshrunk from the odium of their old appellation, taken to themselves a\r\nparticipation of ours, and under the pseudo-republican mask, are now\r\naiming at their second object, and strengthened by unsuspecting\r\nor apostate recruits from our ranks, are advancing fast towards an\r\nascendancy. I have been blamed for saying, that a prevalence of the\r\ndoctrines of consolidation would one day call for reformation or\r\nrevolution. I answer by asking, if a single State of the Union would\r\nhave agreed to the constitution, had it given all powers to the General\r\nGovernment? If the whole opposition to it did not proceed from the\r\njealousy and fear of every State, of being subjected to the other\r\nStates, in matters merely its own? And if there is any reason to believe\r\nthe States more disposed now than then, to acquiesce in this general\r\nsurrender of all their rights and powers to a consolidated government,\r\none and undivided?\r\n\r\nYou request me confidentially, to examine the question, whether the\r\nSupreme Court has advanced beyond its constitutional limits, and\r\ntrespassed on those of the State authorities? I do not undertake it, my\r\ndear Sir, because I am unable. Age, and the wane of mind consequent on\r\nit, have disqualified me from investigations so severe, and researches\r\nso laborious. And it is the less necessary in this case, as having been\r\nalready done by others with a logic and learning to which I could\r\nadd nothing. On the decision of the case of Cohens vs. The State of\r\nVirginia, in the Supreme Court of the United States, in March, 1821,\r\nJudge Roane, under the signature of Algernon Sidney, wrote for the\r\nEnquirer, a series of papers on the law of that case. I considered these\r\npapers maturely as they came out, and confess, that they appeared to me\r\nto pulverize every word which had been delivered by Judge Marshall,\r\nof the extra-judicial part of his opinion; and all was extra-judicial,\r\nexcept the decision that the act of Congress had not purported to\r\ngive to the corporation of Washington the authority claimed by their\r\nlottery-law, of controlling the laws of the States within the States\r\nthemselves. But unable to claim that case, he could not let it go\r\nentirely, but went on gratuitously to prove, that notwithstanding the\r\neleventh amendment of the constitution, a State could be brought, as\r\na defendant, to the bar of his court; and again, that Congress might\r\nauthorize a corporation of its territory to exercise legislation within\r\na State, and paramount to the laws of that State. I cite the sum and\r\nresult only of his doctrines, according to the impression made on my\r\nmind at the time, and still remaining. If not strictly accurate in\r\ncircumstance, it is so in substance. This doctrine was so completely\r\nrefuted by Roane, that if he can be answered, I surrender human reason\r\nas a vain and useless faculty, given to bewilder, and not to guide us.\r\nAnd I mention this particular case as one only of several, because it\r\ngave occasion to that thorough examination of the constitutional limits\r\nbetween the General and State jurisdictions, which you have asked for.\r\nThere were two other writers in the same paper, under the signatures of\r\nFletcher of Saltoun, and Somers, who in a few essays presented some very\r\nluminous and striking views of the question. And there was a particular\r\npaper which recapitulated all the cases in which it was thought the\r\nfederal court had usurped on the State jurisdictions. These essays will\r\nbe found in the Enquirers of 1821, from May the 10th to July the 13th.\r\nIt is not in my present power to send them to you, but if Ritchie can\r\nfurnish them, I will procure and forward them. If they had been read in\r\nthe other States, as they were here, I think they would have left, there\r\nas here, no dissentients from their doctrine. The subject was taken up\r\nby our legislature of 1821-22, and two draughts of remonstrances were\r\nprepared and discussed. As well as I remember, there was no difference\r\nof opinion as to the matter of right; but there was as to the expediency\r\nof a remonstrance at that time, the general mind of the States being\r\nthen under extraordinary excitement by the Missouri question; and it\r\nwas dropped on that consideration. But this case is not dead; it only\r\nsleepeth. The Indian Chief said, he did not go to war for every petty\r\ninjury by itself, but put it into his pouch, and when that was full,\r\nhe then made war. Thank Heaven, we have provided a more peaceable and\r\nrational mode of redress.\r\n\r\nThis practice of Judge Marshall, of travelling out of his case to\r\nprescribe what the law would be in a moot case not before the court, is\r\nvery irregular and very censurable. 1 recollect another instance, and\r\nthe more particularly, perhaps, because it in some measure bore on\r\nmyself. Among the midnight appointments of Mr. Adams, were commissions\r\nto some federal justices of the peace for Alexandria. These were signed\r\nand sealed by him, but not delivered. I found them on the table of the\r\ndepartment of State, on my entrance into office, and 1 forbade their\r\ndelivery. Marbury, named in one of them, applied to the Supreme Court\r\nfor a Mandamus to the Secretary of State (Mr. Madison), to deliver the\r\ncommission intended for him. The Court determined at once, that being an\r\noriginal process, they had no cognizance of it; and there the question\r\nbefore them was ended. But the Chief Justice went on to lay down what\r\nthe law would be, had they jurisdiction of the case; to wit, that they\r\nshould command the delivery.\r\n\r\nThe object was clearly to instruct any other court having the\r\njurisdiction, what they should do, if Marbury should apply to them.\r\nBesides the impropriety of this gratuitous interference, could any thing\r\nexceed the perversion of law? For if there is any principle of law never\r\nyet contradicted, it is that delivery is one of the essentials to\r\nthe validity of a deed. Although signed and sealed, yet as long as it\r\nremains in the hands of the party himself, it is in fieri only, it is\r\nnot a deed, and can be made so only by its delivery. In the hands of a\r\nthird person it may be made an escrow. But whatever is in the executive\r\noffices is certainly deemed to be in the hands of the President; and, in\r\nthis case, was actually in my hands, because, when I countermanded them,\r\nthere was as yet no Secretary of State. Yet this case of Marbury and\r\nMadison is continually cited by bench and bar, as if it were\r\nsettled law, without any animadversion on its being merely an obiter\r\ndissertation of the Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nIt may be impracticable to lay down any general formula of words which\r\nshall decide at once, and with precision, in every case, this limit of\r\njurisdiction. But there are two canons which will guide us safely in\r\nmost of the cases. 1. The capital and leading object of the constitution\r\nwas, to leave with the States all authorities which respected their\r\nown citizens only, and to transfer to the United States those which\r\nrespected citizens of foreign or other States: to make us several as\r\nto ourselves, but one as to all others. In the latter case, then,\r\nconstructions should lean to the general jurisdiction, if the words will\r\nbear it; and in favor of the States in the former, if possible to be so\r\nconstrued. And indeed, between citizens and citizens of the same\r\nState, and under their own laws, I know but a single case in which a\r\njurisdiction is given to the General Government. That is, where any\r\nthing but gold or silver is made a lawful tender, or the obligation of\r\ncontracts is any otherwise impaired. The separate legislatures had so\r\noften abused that power, that the citizens themselves chose to trust\r\nit to the general, rather than to their own special authorities. 2. On\r\nevery question of construction, carry ourselves back to the time when\r\nthe constitution was adopted, recollect the spirit manifested in the\r\ndebates, and instead of trying what meaning may be squeezed out of the\r\ntext, or invented against it, conform to the probable one in which it\r\nwas passed. Let us try Cohen’s case by these canons only, referring\r\nalways however, for full argument, to the essays before cited.\r\n\r\n1. It was between a citizen and his own State, and under a law of his\r\nState. It was a domestic case therefore, and not a foreign one.\r\n\r\n2. Can it be believed, that under the jealousies prevailing against\r\nthe General Government, at the adoption of the constitution, the States\r\nmeant to surrender the authority of preserving order, of enforcing moral\r\nduties, and restraining vice, within their own territory? And this is\r\nthe present case, that of Cohen being under the ancient and general law\r\nof gaming. Can any good be effected, by taking from the States the moral\r\nrule of their citizens, and subordinating it to the general authority,\r\nor to one of their corporations, which may justify forcing the meaning\r\nof words, hunting after possible constructions, and hanging inference on\r\ninference, from heaven to earth, like Jacob’s ladder? Such an intention\r\nwas impossible, and such a licentiousness of construction and inference,\r\nif exercised by, both governments, as may be done with equal right,\r\nwould equally authorize both to claim all powers, general and\r\nparticular, and break up the foundations of the Union. Laws are made for\r\nmen of ordinary understanding, and should, therefore, be construed by\r\nthe ordinary rules of common sense. Their meaning is not to be sought\r\nfor in metaphysical subtleties, which may make any thing mean every\r\nthing or nothing, at pleasure. It should be left to the sophisms of\r\nadvocates, whose trade it is, to prove that a defendant is a plaintiff,\r\nthough dragged into court, torto collo, like Bonaparte’s volunteers into\r\nthe field in chains, or that a power has been given, because it ought\r\nto have been given, et alia talia. The States supposed, that, by their\r\ntenth amendment, they had secured themselves against constructive\r\npowers. They were not lessoned yet by Cohen’s case, nor aware of the\r\nslipperiness of the eels of the law. I ask for no straining of words\r\nagainst the General Government nor yet against the States. I believe the\r\nStates can best govern our home concerns, and the General Government\r\nour foreign ones. I wish, therefore, to see maintained that wholesome\r\ndistribution of powers, established by the constitution for the\r\nlimitation of both; and never to see all offices transferred to\r\nWashington, where, further withdrawn from the eyes of the people, they\r\nmay more secretly be bought and sold, as at market.\r\n\r\nBut the Chief Justice says, ‘there must be an ultimate arbiter\r\nsomewhere.’ True, there must; but does that prove it is either party?\r\nThe ultimate arbiter is the people of the Union, assembled by their\r\ndeputies in convention, at the call of Congress, or of two thirds of the\r\nStates. Let them decide to which they mean to give an authority claimed\r\nby two of their organs. And it has been the peculiar wisdom and felicity\r\nof our constitution, to have provided this peaceable appeal, where that\r\nof other nations is at once to force.\r\n\r\nI rejoice in the example you set of _seriatim_ opinions. I have heard it\r\noften noticed, and always with high approbation. Some of your brethren\r\nwill be encouraged to follow it occasionally, and in time, it may be\r\nfelt by all as a duty, and the sound practice of the primitive court\r\nbe again restored. Why should not every judge be asked his opinion, and\r\ngive it from the bench, if only by yea or nay? Besides ascertaining the\r\nfact of his opinion, which the public have a right to know, in order\r\nto judge whether it is impeachable or not, it would show whether the\r\nopinions were unanimous or not, and thus settle more exactly the weight\r\nof their authority.\r\n\r\nThe close of my second sheet warns me that it is time now to relieve\r\nyou from this letter of unmerciful length. Indeed, I wonder how I have\r\naccomplished it, with two crippled wrists, the one scarcely able to move\r\nmy pen, the other to hold my paper. But I am hurried sometimes beyond\r\nthe sense of pain, when unbosoming myself to friends who harmonize with\r\nme in principle. You and I may differ occasionally in details of minor\r\nconsequence, as no two minds, more than two faces, are the same in\r\nevery feature. But our general objects are the same; to preserve the\r\nrepublican form and principles of our constitution, and cleave to the\r\nsalutary distribution of powers which that has established. These are\r\nthe two sheet anchors of our Union. If driven from either, we shall be\r\nin danger of foundering. To my prayers for its safety and perpetuity, I\r\nadd those for the continuation of your health, happiness, and usefulness\r\nto your country.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXIII.--TO JAMES MADISON, August 30,1823\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nMonticello, August 30,1823.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI received the enclosed letters from the President, with a request that\r\nafter perusal I would forward them to you, for perusal by yourself also,\r\nand to be returned then to him.\r\n\r\nYou have doubtless seen Timothy Pickering’s fourth of July observations\r\non the Declaration of Independence. If his principles and prejudices,\r\npersonal and political, gave us no reason to doubt whether he had truly\r\nquoted the information he alleges to have received from Mr. Adams, I\r\nshould then say, that in some of the particulars, Mr. Adams’s memory\r\nhas led him into unquestionable error. At the age of eighty-eight, and\r\nforty-seven years after the transactions of Independence, this is not\r\nwonderful. Nor should I, at the age of eighty, on the small advantage\r\nof that difference only, venture to oppose my memory to his, were it\r\nnot supported by written notes, taken by myself at the moment and on the\r\nspot. He says, ‘The committee of five, to wit, Doctor Franklin,\r\nSherman, Livingston, and ourselves, met, discussed the subject, and\r\nthen appointed him and myself to make the draught; that, we, as a\r\nsub-committee, met, and after the urgencies of each on the other, I\r\nconsented to undertake the task; that, the draught being made, we, the\r\nsub-committee, met, and conned the paper over, and he does not remember\r\nthat he made or suggested a single alteration.’ Now these details\r\nare quite incorrect. The committee of five met; no such thing as a\r\nsub-committee was proposed, but they unanimously pressed on myself alone\r\nto undertake the draught. I consented; I drew it: but before I reported\r\nit to the committee, I communicated it separately to Doctor Franklin\r\nand Mr. Adams, requesting their corrections, because they were the two\r\nmembers of whose judgments and amendments I wished most to have the\r\nbenefit, before presenting it to the committee: and you have seen the\r\noriginal paper now in my hands, with the corrections of Doctor Franklin\r\nand Mr. Adams interlined in their own hand-writings. Their alterations\r\nwere two or three only, and merely verbal. I then wrote a fair copy,\r\nreported it to the committee, and from them, unaltered, to Congress.\r\nThis personal communication and consultation with Mr. Adams, he\r\nhas misremembered into the actings of a sub-committee. Pickering’s\r\nobservations, and Mr. Adams’s in addition, ‘that it contained no new\r\nideas, that it is a common-place compilation, its sentiments hacknied\r\nin Congress for two years before, and its essence contained in Otis’s\r\npamphlet,’ may all be true. Of that I am not to be the judge. Richard\r\nHenry Lee charged it as copied from Locke’s Treatise on Government.\r\nOtis’s pamphlet I never saw, and whether I had gathered my ideas from\r\nreading or reflection I do not know. I know only that I turned to\r\nneither book nor pamphlet while writing it. I did not consider it as\r\nany part of my charge to invent new ideas altogether, and to offer no\r\nsentiment which had ever been expressed before. Had Mr. Adams been\r\nso restrained, Congress would have lost the benefit of his bold and\r\nimpressive advocations of the rights of Revolution. For no man’s\r\nconfident and fervid addresses, more than Mr. Adams’s, encouraged and\r\nsupported us through the difficulties surrounding us, which, like the\r\nceaseless action of gravity, weighed on us by night and by day. Yet, on\r\nthe same ground, we may ask what of these elevated thoughts was new, or\r\ncan be affirmed never before to have entered the conceptions of man?\r\n\r\nWhether, also, the sentiments of Independence, and the reasons for\r\ndeclaring it, which makes so great a portion of the instrument, had been\r\nhacknied in Congress for two years before the 4th of July, ‘76, or this\r\ndictum also of Mr. Adams be another slip of memory, let history\r\nsay. This, however, I will say for Mr. Adams, that he supported the\r\nDeclaration with zeal and ability, fighting fearlessly for every word of\r\nit. As to myself, I thought it a duty to be, on that occasion, a passive\r\nauditor of the opinions of others, more impartial judges than I could\r\nbe, of its merits or demerits. During the debate I was sitting by\r\nDoctor Franklin, and he observed that I was writhing a little under\r\nthe acrimonious criticisms on some of its parts; and it was on that\r\noccasion, that by way of comfort, he told me the story of John Thomson,\r\nthe hatter, and his new sign.\r\n\r\nTimothy thinks the instrument the better for having a fourth of it\r\nexpunged. He would have thought it still better, had the other three\r\nfourths gone out also, all but the single sentiment (the only one he\r\napproves), which recommends friendship to his dear England, whenever she\r\nis willing to be at peace with us. His insinuations are, that although\r\n‘the high tone of the instrument was in unison with the warm feelings of\r\nthe times, this sentiment of habitual friendship to England should never\r\nbe forgotten, and that the duties it enjoins should especially be borne\r\nin mind on every celebration of this anniversary.’ In other words, that\r\nthe Declaration, as being a libel on the government of England, composed\r\nin times of passion, should now be buried in utter oblivion, to spare\r\nthe feelings of our English friends and Angloman fellow-citizens. But it\r\nis not to wound them that we wish to keep it in mind; but to cherish the\r\nprinciples of the instrument in the besoms of our own citizens: and it\r\nis a heavenly comfort to see that these principles are yet so strongly\r\nfelt, as to render a circumstance so trifling as this little lapse of\r\nmemory of Mr. Adams’s, worthy of being solemnly announced and supported\r\nat an anniversary assemblage of the nation on its birth-day. In\r\nopposition, however, to Mr. Pickering, I pray God that these principles\r\nmay be eternal, and close the prayer with my affectionate wishes for\r\nyourself of long life, health, and happiness.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXIV.--TO JOHN ADAMS, September 4, 1823\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nMonticello, September 4, 1823.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour letter of August the 15th was received in due time, and with the\r\nwelcome of every thing which comes from you. With its opinions on the\r\ndifficulties of revolutions from despotism to freedom, I very much\r\nconcur. The generation which commences a revolution rarely completes it.\r\nHabituated from their infancy to passive submission of body fend mind\r\nto their kings and priests, they are not qualified, when called on,\r\nto think and provide for themselves; and their inexperience, their\r\nignorance and bigotry, make them instruments often, in the hands of the\r\nBonapartes and Iturbides, to defeat their own rights and purposes. This\r\nis the present situation of Europe and Spanish America. But it is\r\nnot desperate. The light which has been shed on mankind by the art of\r\nprinting, has eminently changed the condition of the world. As yet, that\r\nlight has dawned on the middling classes only of the men in Europe.\r\nThe kings and the rabble, of equal ignorance, have not yet received its\r\nrays; but it continues to spread, and while printing is preserved, it\r\ncan no more recede than the sun return on his course. A first attempt to\r\nrecover the right of self-government may fail, so may a second, a third,\r\n&c. But as a younger and more instructed race comes on, the sentiment\r\nbecomes more and more intuitive, and a fourth, a fifth, or some\r\nsubsequent one of the ever-renewed attempts will ultimately succeed.\r\nIn France, the first effort was defeated by Robespierre, the second by\r\nBonaparte, the third by Louis XVIII., and his holy allies; another is\r\nyet to come, and all Europe, Russia excepted, has caught the spirit; and\r\nall will attain representative government, more or less perfect. This\r\nis now well understood to be a necessary check on Kings, whom they will\r\nprobably think it more prudent to chain and tame, than to exterminate.\r\nTo attain all this, however, rivers of blood must yet flow, and years of\r\ndesolation pass over; yet the object is worth rivers of blood, and years\r\nof desolation. For what inheritance so valuable, can man leave to his\r\nposterity? The spirit of the Spaniard, and his deadly and eternal hatred\r\nto a Frenchman, give me much confidence that he will never submit, but\r\nfinally defeat this atrocious violation of the laws of God and man,\r\nunder which he is suffering; and the wisdom and firmness of the Cortes,\r\nafford reasonable hope, that that nation will settle down in a temperate\r\nrepresentative government, with an executive properly subordinated to\r\nthat. Portugal, Italy, Prussia, Germany, Greece, will follow suit. You\r\nand I shall look down from another world on these glorious achievements\r\nto man, which will add to the joys even of heaven.\r\n\r\nI observe your toast of Mr. Jay on the 4th of July, wherein you say that\r\nthe omission of his signature to the Declaration of Independence was by\r\naccident. Our impressions as to this fact being different, I shall\r\nbe glad to have mine corrected, if wrong. Jay, you know, had been in\r\nconstant opposition to our laboring majority. Our estimate at the time\r\nwas, that he, Dickinson, and Johnson of Maryland, by their ingenuity,\r\nperseverance, and partiality to our English connection, had constantly\r\nkept us a year behind where we ought to have been, in our preparations\r\nand proceedings. From about the date of the Virginia instructions of May\r\nthe 15th, 1776, to declare Independence, Mr. Jay absented himself from\r\nCongress, and never came there again until December, 1778. Of course,\r\nhe had no part in the discussions or decision of that question. The\r\ninstructions to their Delegates by the convention of New York, then\r\nsitting, to sign the Declaration, were presented to Congress on the 15th\r\nof July only, and on that day the journals show the absence of Mr. Jay,\r\nby a letter received from him, as they had done as early as the 29th\r\nof May, by another letter. And I think he had been omitted by the\r\nconvention on a new election of Delegates, when they changed their\r\ninstructions. Of this last fact, however, having no evidence but an\r\nancient impression, I shall not affirm it. But whether so or not, no\r\nagency of accident appears in the case. This error of fact, however,\r\nwhether yours or mine, is of little consequence to the public. But\r\ntruth being as cheap as error, it is as well to rectify it for our own\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nI have had a fever of about three weeks, during the last and preceding\r\nmonth, from which I am entirely recovered except as to strength.\r\n\r\nEver affectionately yours.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXV.--TO JOHN ADAMS, October 12, 1823\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nMonticello, October 12, 1823.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI do not write with the ease which your letter of September the 18th\r\nsupposes. Crippled wrists and fingers make writing slow and laborious.\r\nBut while writing to you, I lose the sense of these things in the\r\nrecollection of ancient times, when youth and health made happiness out\r\nof every thing. I forget for a while the hoary winter of age, when we\r\ncan think of nothing but how to keep ourselves warm, and how to get rid\r\nof our heavy hours until the friendly hand of death shall rid us of all\r\nat once. Against this _tedium vita_, however, I am fortunately mounted\r\non a hobby, which, indeed, I should have better managed some thirty\r\nor forty years ago; but whose easy amble is still sufficient to give\r\nexercise and amusement to an octogenary rider. This is the establishment\r\nof a University, on a scale more comprehensive, and in a country more\r\nhealthy and central than our old William and Mary, which these obstacles\r\nhave long kept in a state of languor and inefficiency. But the tardiness\r\nwith which such works proceed, may render it doubtful whether I shall\r\nlive to see it go into action.\r\n\r\nPutting aside these things, however, for the present, I write this\r\nletter as due to a friendship coeval with our government, and now\r\nattempted to be poisoned, when too late in life to be replaced by new\r\naffections. I had for some time observed, in the public papers, dark\r\nhints and mysterious innuendoes of a correspondence of yours with a\r\nfriend, to whom you had opened your bosom without reserve, and which was\r\nto be made public by that friend or his representative. And now it is\r\nsaid to be actually published. It has not yet reached us, but extracts\r\nhave been given, and such as seemed most likely to draw a curtain of\r\nseparation between you and myself. Were there no other motive than that\r\nof indignation against the author of this outrage on private confidence,\r\nwhose shaft seems to have been aimed at yourself more particularly, this\r\nwould make it the duty of every honorable mind to disappoint that\r\naim, by opposing to its impression a seven-fold shield of apathy\r\nand insensibility. With me, however, no such armor is needed. The\r\ncircumstances of the times in which we have happened to live, and the\r\npartiality of our friends at a particular period, placed us in a state\r\nof apparent opposition, which some might suppose to be personal also:\r\nand there might, not be wanting those who wished to make it so, by\r\nfilling our ears with malignant falsehoods, by dressing up hideous\r\nphantoms of their own creation, presenting them to you under my name,\r\nto me under yours, and endeavoring to instil into our minds things\r\nconcerning each other the most destitute of truth. And if there had\r\nbeen, at any time, a moment when we were off our guard, and in a temper\r\nto let the whispers of these people make us forget what we had known of\r\neach other for so many years, and years of so much trial, yet all men,\r\nwho have attended to the workings of the human mind, who have seen\r\nthe false colors under which passion sometimes dresses the actions and\r\nmotives of others, have seen also those passions subsiding with time and\r\nreflection, dissipating like mists before the rising sun, and restoring\r\nto us the sight of all things in their true shape and colors. It would\r\nbe strange, indeed, if, at our years, we were to go an age back to hunt\r\nup imaginary or forgotten facts, to disturb the repose of affections so\r\nsweetening to the evening of our lives. Be assured, my dear Sir, that I\r\nam incapable of receiving the slightest impression from the effort now\r\nmade to plant thorns on the pillow of age, worth, and wisdom, and to\r\nsow tares between friends who have been such for near half a century.\r\nBeseeching you, then, not to suffer your mind to be disquieted by this\r\nwicked attempt to poison its peace, and praying you to throw it by among\r\nthe things which have never happened, I add sincere assurances of my\r\nunabated and constant attachment, friendship, and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXVI.--TO THE PRESIDENT, October 24,1823\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nMonticello, October 24,1823.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nThe question presented by the letters you have sent me, is the most\r\nmomentous which has ever been offered to my contemplation since that of\r\nIndependence. That made us a nation, this sets our compass, and points\r\nthe course which we are to steer through the ocean of time opening on\r\nus. And never could we embark on it under circumstances more auspicious.\r\nOur first and fundamental maxim should be, never to entangle ourselves\r\nin the broils of Europe. Our second, never to suffer Europe to\r\nintermeddle with cis-Atlantic affairs. America, North and South, has a\r\nset of interests distinct from those of Europe, and peculiarly her own.\r\n\r\nShe should therefore have a system of her own, separate and apart from\r\nthat of Europe. While the last is laboring to become the domicile of\r\ndespotism, our endeavor should surely be, to make our hemisphere that of\r\nfreedom. One nation, most of all, could disturb us in this pursuit;\r\nshe now offers to lead, aid, and accompany us in it. By acceding to her\r\nproposition, we detach her from the band of despots, bring her mighty\r\nweight into the scale of free government, and emancipate a continent at\r\none stroke, which might otherwise linger long in doubt and difficulty.\r\nGreat Britain is the nation which can do us the most harm of any one,\r\nor all, on earth; and with her on our side we need not fear the whole\r\nworld. With her, then, we should most sedulously cherish a cordial\r\nfriendship; and nothing would tend more to knit our affections, than to\r\nbe fighting once more, side by side, in the same cause. Not that I would\r\npurchase even her amity at the price of taking part in her wars. But the\r\nwar in which the present proposition might engage us, should that be its\r\nconsequence, is not her war, but ours. Its object is to introduce and\r\nestablish the American system, of keeping out of our land all foreign\r\npowers, of never permitting those of Europe to intermeddle with the\r\naffairs of our nations. It is to maintain our own principle, not to\r\ndepart from it. And if, to facilitate this, we can effect a division\r\nin the body of the European powers, and draw over to our side its\r\nmost powerful member, surely we should do it. But I am clearly of Mr.\r\nCanning’s opinion, that it will prevent instead of provoking war. With\r\nGreat Britain withdrawn from their scale, and shifted into that of our\r\ntwo continents, all Europe combined would not undertake such a war. For\r\nhow would they propose to get at either enemy without superior fleets?\r\nNor is the occasion to be slighted which this proposition offers, of\r\ndeclaring our protest against the atrocious violations of the rights\r\nof nations, by the interference of any one in the internal affairs of\r\nanother, so flagitiously begun by Bonaparte, and now continued by the\r\nequally lawless Alliance, calling itself Holy.\r\n\r\nBut we have first to ask ourselves a question. Do we wish to acquire to\r\nour own confederacy any one or more of the Spanish provinces? I candidly\r\nconfess, that I have ever looked on Cuba as the most interesting\r\naddition which could ever be made to our system of States. The control\r\nwhich, with Florida Point, this island would give us over the Gulf of\r\nMexico, and the countries and isthmus bordering on it, as well as\r\nall those whose waters flow into it, would fill up the measure of our\r\npolitical well-being. Yet, as I am sensible that this can never be\r\nobtained, even with her own consent, but by war; and its independence,\r\nwhich is our second interest (and especially its independence of\r\nEngland), can be secured without it, I have no hesitation in abandoning\r\nmy first wish to future chances, and accepting its independence, with\r\npeace and the friendship of England, rather than its association, at the\r\nexpense of war and her enmity.\r\n\r\nI could honestly, therefore, join in the declaration proposed, that we\r\naim not at the acquisition of any of those possessions, that we will not\r\nstand in the way of any amicable arrangement between them and the mother\r\ncountry; but that we will oppose, with all our means, the forcible\r\ninterposition of any other power, as auxiliary, stipendiary, or under\r\nany other form or pretext, and most especially, their transfer to any\r\npower by conquest, cession, or acquisition in any other way. I should\r\nthink it, therefore, advisable, that the Executive should encourage the\r\nBritish government to a continuance in the dispositions expressed in\r\nthese letters, by an assurance of his concurrence with them as far as\r\nhis authority goes; and that as it may lead to war, the declaration of\r\nwhich requires an act of Congress, the case shall be laid before them\r\nfor consideration at their first meeting, and under the reasonable\r\naspect in which it is seen by himself.\r\n\r\nI have been so long weaned from political subjects, and have so long\r\nceased to take any interest in them, that I am sensible I am not\r\nqualified to offer opinions on them worthy of any attention. But the\r\nquestion now proposed involves consequences so lasting, and effects so\r\ndecisive of our future destinies, as to re-kindle all the interest I\r\nhave heretofore felt on such occasions, and to induce me to the hazard\r\nof opinions, which will prove only my wish to contribute still my mite\r\ntowards any thing which may be useful to our country. And praying you to\r\naccept it at only what it is worth, I add the assurance of my constant\r\nand affectionate friendship and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXVII.--TO THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE, November 4, 1823\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE.\r\n\r\nMonticello, November 4, 1823.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Friend,\r\n\r\nTwo dislocated wrists and crippled fingers have rendered writing so\r\nslow and laborious, as to oblige me to withdraw from nearly all\r\ncorrespondence: not, however, from yours, while I can make a stroke with\r\na pen. We have gone through too many trying scenes together, to forget\r\nthe sympathies and affections they nourished.\r\n\r\nYour trials have indeed been long and severe. When they will end, is yet\r\nunknown, but where they will end, cannot be doubted. Alliances, Holy or\r\nHellish, may be formed, and retard the epoch of deliverance, may swell\r\nthe rivers of blood which are yet to flow, but their own will close the\r\nscene, and leave to mankind the right of self-government. I trust that\r\nSpain will prove, that a nation cannot be conquered which determines\r\nnot to be so, and that her success will be the turning of the tide of\r\nliberty, no more to be arrested by human efforts. Whether the state of\r\nsociety in Europe can bear a republican government, I doubted, you know\r\nwhen with you, and I do now. A hereditary chief, strictly limited, the\r\nright of war vested in the legislative body, a rigid economy of the\r\npublic contributions, and absolute interdiction of all useless expenses,\r\nwill go far towards keeping the government honest and unoppressive.\r\nBut the only security o£ all, is in a free press. The force of public\r\nopinion cannot be resisted, when permitted freely to be expressed. The\r\nagitation it produces must be submitted to. It is necessary to keep the\r\nwaters pure.\r\n\r\nWe are all, for example, in agitation even in our peaceful country. For\r\nin peace as well as in war, the mind must be kept in motion. Who is\r\nto be the next President, is the topic here of every conversation. My\r\nopinion on that subject is what I expressed to you in my last letter.\r\nThe question will be ultimately reduced to the northernmost and\r\nsouthernmost candidates. The former will get every federal vote in the\r\nUnion, and many republicans; the latter, all those denominated of\r\nthe old school; for you are not to believe that these two parties are\r\namalgamated, that the lion and the lamb are lying down together.\r\nThe Hartford convention, the victory of Orleans, the peace of Ghent,\r\nprostrated the name of federalism. Its votaries abandoned it through\r\nshame and mortification; and now call themselves republicans. But the\r\nname alone is changed, the principles are the same. For in truth,\r\nthe parties of Whig and Tory are those of nature. They exist in all\r\ncountries, whether called by these names, or by those of Aristocrats and\r\nDemocrats, Cote Droite and Cote Gauche, Ultras and Radicals, Serviles\r\nand Liberals. The sickly, weakly, timid man, fears the people, and is\r\na tory by nature. The healthy, strong, and bold, cherishes them, and is\r\nformed a whig by nature. On the eclipse of federalism with us, although\r\nnot its extinction, its leaders got up the Missouri question, under the\r\nfalse front of lessening the measure of slavery, but with the real view\r\nof producing a geographical division of parties, which might insure\r\nthem the next President. The people of the north went blindfold into the\r\nsnare, followed their leaders for a while with a zeal truly moral and\r\nlaudable, until they became sensible that they were injuring instead of\r\naiding the real interests of the slaves, that they had been used, merely\r\nas tools for electioneering purposes; and that trick of hypocrisy then\r\nfell as quickly as it had been got up. To that is now succeeding a\r\ndistinction, which, like that of republican and federal, or whig and\r\ntory, being equally intermixed through every State, threatens none of\r\nthose geographical schisms which go immediately to a separation. The\r\nline of division now is the preservation of State rights as reserved in\r\nthe constitution, or by strained constructions of that instrument,\r\nto merge all into a consolidated government. The tories are for\r\nstrengthening the executive and General Government; the whigs cherish\r\nthe representative branch, and the rights reserved by the States, as the\r\nbulwark against consolidation, which must immediately generate monarchy.\r\nAnd although this division excites, as yet, no warmth, yet it exists,\r\nis well understood, and will be a principle of voting at the ensuing\r\nelection, with the reflecting men of both parties.\r\n\r\nI thank you much for the two books you were so kind as to send me by Mr.\r\nGallatin. Miss Wright had before favored me with the first edition of\r\nher American work: but her ‘Few Days in Athens,’ was entirely new, and\r\nhas been a treat to me of the highest order. The matter and manner\r\nof the dialogue is strictly ancient; the principles of the sects are\r\nbeautifully and candidly explained and contrasted; and the scenery and\r\nportraiture of the interlocutors are of higher finish than any thing in\r\nthat line left us by the ancients; and like Ossian, if not ancient, it\r\nis equal to the best morsels of antiquity. I augur, from this instance,\r\nthat Herculaneum is likely to furnish better specimens of modern than of\r\nancient genius; and may we not hope more from the same pen?\r\n\r\nAfter much sickness, and the accident of a broken and disabled arm, I\r\nam again in tolerable health, but extremely debilitated, so as to be\r\nscarcely able to walk into my garden. The hebitude of age too, and\r\nextinguishment of interest in the things around me, are weaning me from\r\nthem, and dispose me with cheerfulness to resign them to the existing\r\ngeneration, satisfied that the daily advance of science will enable them\r\nto administer the commonwealth with increased wisdom. You have still\r\nmany valuable years to give to your country, and with my prayers that,\r\nthey may be years of health and happiness, and especially that they may\r\nsee the establishment of the principles of government which you have\r\ncherished through life, accept the assurance of my affectionate and\r\nconstant friendship and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXVIII.--TO JOSEPH C CABELL, February 3, 1824\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH C CABELL.\r\n\r\nMonticello, February 3, 1824.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI am favored with your two letters of January the 26th and 29th, and\r\nam glad that yourself and the friends of the University are so well\r\nsatisfied, that the provisos amendatory of the University Act are mere\r\nnullities. I had not been able to put out of my head the Algebraical\r\nequation, which was among the first of my college lessons, that a—a = 0.\r\nYet I cheerfully arrange myself to your opinions. I did not suppose, nor\r\ndo I now suppose it possible, that both Houses of the legislature should\r\never consent, for an additional fifteen thousand dollars of revenue,\r\nto set all the Professors and students of the University adrift: and\r\nif foreigners will have the same confidence which we have in our\r\nlegislature, no harm will have been done by the provisos.\r\n\r\nYou recollect that we had agreed that the Visitors who are of the\r\nlegislature should fix on a certain day of meeting, after the rising of\r\nthe Assembly, to put into immediate motion the measures which this act\r\nwas expected to call for. You will of course remind the Governor that\r\na re-appointment of Visitors is to be made on the day following Sunday,\r\nthe 29th of this month; and as he is to appoint the day of their first\r\nmeeting, it would be well to recommend to him that which our brethren\r\nthere shall fix on. It may be designated by the Governor as the third,\r\nfourth, &c. day after the rising of the legislature, which will give it\r\ncertainty enough.\r\n\r\nYou ask what sum would be desirable for the purchase of books and\r\napparatus. Certainly the largest you can obtain. Forty or fifty thousand\r\ndollars would enable us to purchase the most essential books of text\r\nand reference for the schools, and such an apparatus for Mathematics,\r\nAstronomy, and Chemistry, as may enable us to set out with tolerable\r\ncompetence, if we can, through the banks and otherwise, anticipate the\r\nwhole sum at once.\r\n\r\nI remark what you say on the subject of committing ourselves to any one\r\nfor the Law appointment. Your caution is perfectly just. I hope, and am\r\ncertain, that this will be the standing law of discretion and duty with\r\nevery member of our board, in this and all cases. You know we have\r\nall, from the beginning, considered the high qualifications of our\r\nProfessors, as the only means by which we can give to our institution\r\nsplendor and pre-eminence over all its sister seminaries. The only\r\nquestion, therefore, we can ever ask ourselves, as to any candidate,\r\nwill be, Is he the most highly qualified? The college of Philadelphia\r\nhas lost its character of primacy by indulging motives of favoritism and\r\nnepotism, and by conferring the appointments as if the professorships\r\nwere entrusted to them as provisions for their friends. And even that\r\nof Edinburgh, you know, is also much lowered from the same cause. We are\r\nnext to observe, that a man is not qualified for a Professor, knowing\r\nnothing but merely his own profession. He should be otherwise well\r\neducated as to the sciences generally; able to converse understandingly\r\nwith the scientific men with whom he is associated, and to assist in the\r\ncouncils of the Faculty on any subject of science on which they may have\r\noccasion to deliberate. Without this, he will incur their contempt,\r\nand bring disreputation on the institution. With respect to the\r\nprofessorship you mention, I scarcely know any of our judges personally;\r\nbut I will name, for example, the late Judge Roane, who, I believe, was\r\ngenerally admitted to be among the ablest of them. His knowledge was\r\nconfined to the common law chiefly, which does not constitute one half\r\nof the qualification of a really learned lawyer, much less that of a\r\nProfessor of law for an University. And as to any other branches\r\nof science, he must have stood mute in the presence of his literary\r\nassociates, or of any learned strangers or others visiting the\r\nUniversity. Would this constitute the splendid stand we propose to take?\r\n\r\nIn the course of the trusts I have exercised through life with powers of\r\nappointment, I can say with truth, and with unspeakable comfort, that I\r\nnever did appoint a relation to office, and that merely because I\r\nnever saw the case in which some one did not offer, or occur, better\r\nqualified; and I have the most unlimited confidence, that in the\r\nappointment of Professors to our nursling institution, every individual\r\nof my associates will look with a single eye to the sublimation of its\r\ncharacter, and adopt, as our sacred motto, ‘_Detur digniori_? In this\r\nway it will honor us, and bless our country.\r\n\r\nI perceive that I have permitted my reflections to run into generalities\r\nbeyond the scope of the particular intimation in your letter I will let\r\nthem go, however, as a general confession of faith, not belonging merely\r\nto the present case.\r\n\r\nName me affectionately to our brethren with you, and be assured yourself\r\nof my constant friendship and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXIX.--TO JARED SPARKS, February 4, 1824\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JARED SPARKS.\r\n\r\nMonticello, February 4, 1824.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI duly received your favor of the 3th, and with it the last number of\r\nthe North American Review. This has anticipated the one I should receive\r\nin course, but have not yet received, under my subscription to the new\r\nseries. The article on the African colonization of the people of color,\r\nto which you invite my attention, I have read with great consideration.\r\nIt is, indeed, a fine one, and will do much good. I learn from it more,\r\ntoo, than I had before known, of the degree of success and promise of\r\nthat colony.\r\n\r\nIn the disposition of these unfortunate people, there are two rational\r\nobjects to be distinctly kept in view. 1. The establishment of a colony\r\non the coast of Africa, which may introduce among the aborigines the\r\narts of cultivated life, and the blessings of civilization and science.\r\nBy doing this, we may make to them some retribution for the long course\r\nof injuries we have been committing on their population. And considering\r\nthat these blessings will descend to the ‘_nati natorum, et qui\r\nnascentur ab illis_,’ we shall in the long run have rendered them\r\nperhaps more good than evil. To fulfil this object, the colony of\r\nSierra Leone promises well, and that of Mesurado adds to our prospect of\r\nsuccess. Under this view, the Colonization Society is to be considered\r\nas a missionary society, having in view, however, objects more humane,\r\nmore justifiable, and less aggressive on the peace of other nations,\r\nthan the others of that appellation.\r\n\r\nThe second object, and the most interesting to us, as coming home to\r\nour physical and moral characters, to our happiness and safety, is to\r\nprovide an asylum to which we can, by degrees, send the whole of that\r\npopulation from among us, and establish them under our patronage and\r\nprotection, as a separate, free, and independent people, in some country\r\nand climate friendly to human life and happiness. That any place on the\r\ncoast of Africa should answer the latter purpose, I have ever deemed\r\nentirely impossible. And without repeating the other arguments which\r\nhave been urged by others, I will appeal to figures only, which admit\r\nno controversy. I shall speak in round numbers, not absolutely accurate,\r\nyet not so wide from truth as to vary the result materially. There are\r\nin the United States a million and a half of people of color in\r\nslavery. To send off the whole of these at once, nobody conceives to be\r\npracticable for us, or expedient for them. Let us take twenty-five years\r\nfor its accomplishment, within which time they will be doubled. Their\r\nestimated value as property, in the first place, (for actual property\r\nhas been lawfully vested in that form, and who can lawfully take it from\r\nthe possessors?) at an average of two hundred dollars each, young and\r\nold, would amount to six hundred millions of dollars, which must be paid\r\nor lost by somebody. To this, add the cost of their transportation\r\nby land and sea to Mesurado, a year’s provision of food and clothing,\r\nimplements of husbandry and of their trades, which will amount to three\r\nhundred millions more, making thirty-six millions of dollars a year\r\nfor twenty-five years, with insurance of peace all that time, and it is\r\nimpossible to look at the question a second time. I am aware that at\r\nthe end of about sixteen years, a gradual detraction from this sum will\r\ncommence, from the gradual diminution of breeders, and go on during\r\nthe remaining nine years. Calculate this deduction, and it is still\r\nimpossible to look at the enterprise a second time. I do not say this to\r\ninduce an inference that the getting rid of them is for ever impossible.\r\nFor that is neither my opinion nor my hope. But only that it cannot be\r\ndone in this way. There is, I think, a way in which it can be done; that\r\nis, by emancipating the after born, leaving them, on due compensation,\r\nwith their mothers, until their services are worth their maintenance,\r\nand then putting them to industrious occupations, until a proper age for\r\ndeportation. This was the result of my reflections on the subject five\r\nand forty years ago, and I have never yet been able to conceive any\r\nother practicable plan. It was sketched in the Notes on Virginia, under\r\nthe fourteenth query. The estimated value of the new-born infant is\r\nso low (say twelve dollars and fifty cents), that it would probably\r\nbe yielded by the owner gratis, and would thus reduce the six hundred\r\nmillions of dollars, the first head of expense, to thirty-seven millions\r\nand a half: leaving only the expenses of nourishment while with the\r\nmother, and of transportation. And from what fund are these expenses to\r\nbe furnished? Why not from that of the lands which have been ceded by\r\nthe very States now needing this relief? And ceded on no consideration,\r\nfor the most part, but that of the general good of the whole. These\r\ncessions already constitute one fourth of the States of the Union. It\r\nmay be said that these lands have been sold; are now the property of\r\nthe citizens composing those States; and the money long ago received and\r\nexpended. But an equivalent of lands in the territories since acquired\r\nmay be appropriated to that object, or so much at least, as may be\r\nsufficient; and the object, although more important to the slave States,\r\nis highly so to the others also, if they were serious in their arguments\r\non the Missouri question. The slave States, too, if more interested,\r\nwould also contribute more by their gratuitous liberation, thus taking\r\non themselves alone the first and heaviest item of expense.\r\n\r\nIn the plan sketched in the Notes on Virginia, no particular place\r\nof asylum was specified; because it was thought possible, that in the\r\nrevolutionary state of America, then commenced, events might open to us\r\nsome one within practicable distance. This has now happened. St. Domingo\r\nhas become independent, and with a population of that color only; and\r\nif the public papers are to be credited, their Chief offers to pay\r\ntheir passage, to receive them as free citizens, and to provide them\r\nemployment. This leaves, then, for the general confederacy, no expense\r\nbut of nurture with the mother a few years, and would call, of course,\r\nfor a very moderate appropriation of the vacant lands. Suppose the whole\r\nannual increase to be of sixty thousand effective births, fifty vessels,\r\nof four hundred tons burthen each, constantly employed in that short\r\nrun, would carry off the increase of every year, and the old stock\r\nwould die off in the ordinary course of nature, lessening from the\r\ncommencement until its final disappearance. In this way no violation of\r\nprivate rights is proposed. Voluntary surrenders would probably come in\r\nas fast as the means to be provided for their care would be competent\r\nto it. Looking at my own State only, (and I presume not to speak for\r\nthe others,) I verily believe that this surrender of property would\r\nnot amount to more, annually, than half our present direct taxes, to be\r\ncontinued fully about twenty or twenty-five years, and then gradually\r\ndiminishing for as many more until their final extinction; and even this\r\nhalf tax would not be paid in cash, but by the delivery of an object\r\nwhich they have never yet known or counted as part of their property:\r\nand those not possessing the object will be called on for nothing. I\r\ndo not go into all the details of the burthens and benefits of this\r\noperation. And who could estimate its blessed effects? I leave this\r\nto those who will live to see their accomplishment, and to enjoy a\r\nbeatitude forbidden to my age. But I leave it with this admonition, to\r\nrise and be doing. A million and a half are within their control;\r\nbut six millions (which a majority of those now living will see them\r\nattain), and one million of these fighting men, will say, ‘We will not\r\ngo.’\r\n\r\nI am aware that this subject involves some constitutional scruples.\r\nBut a liberal construction, justified by the object, may go far, and\r\nan amendment of the constitution, the whole length necessary. The\r\nseparation of infants from their mothers, too, would produce some\r\nscruples of humanity. But this would be straining at a gnat, and\r\nswallowing a camel.\r\n\r\nI am much pleased to see that you have taken up the subject of the duty\r\non imported books. I hope a crusade will be kept up against it, until\r\nthose in power shall become sensible of this stain on our legislation\r\nand shall wipe it from their code, and from the remembrance of man, if\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nI salute you with assurances of high respect and esteem.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson„\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXX.--TO EDWARD LIVINGSTON, April 4, 1824\r\n\r\n\r\nTO EDWARD LIVINGSTON.\r\n\r\nMonticello, April 4, 1824.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nIt was with great pleasure I learned that the good people of New Orleans\r\nhad restored you again to the councils of our country. I did not doubt\r\nthe aid it would bring to the remains of our old school in Congress, in\r\nwhich your early labors had been so useful. You will find, I suppose,\r\non revisiting our maritime States, the names of things more changed than\r\nthe things themselves; that though our old opponents have given up their\r\nappellation, they have not, in assuming ours, abandoned their views, and\r\nthat they are as strong nearly as they ever were. These cares, however,\r\nare no longer mine. I resign myself cheerfully to the managers of the\r\nship, and the more contentedly, as I am near the end of my voyage. I\r\nhave learned to be less confident in the conclusions of human reason,\r\nand give more credit to the honesty of contrary opinions. The radical\r\nidea of the character of the constitution of our government, which I\r\nhave adopted as a key in cases of doubtful construction, is, that the\r\nwhole field of government is divided into two departments, domestic and\r\nforeign, (the States in their mutual relations being of the latter) that\r\nthe former department is reserved exclusively to the respective States\r\nwithin their own limits, and the latter assigned to a separate set of\r\nfunctionaries, constituting what may be called the, foreign branch,\r\nwhich, instead of a federal basis, is established as a distinct\r\ngovernment _quo ad hoc_, acting as the domestic branch does on the\r\ncitizens directly and coercively; that these departments have distinct\r\ndirectories, co-ordinate, and equally independent and supreme, each\r\nwithin its own sphere of action. Whenever a doubt arises to which of\r\nthese branches a power belongs, I try it by this test. I recollect no\r\ncase where a question simply between citizens of the same State has been\r\ntransferred to the foreign department, except that of inhibiting tenders\r\nbut of metallic money, and _ex post facto_ legislation. The causes of\r\nthese singularities are well remembered.\r\n\r\nI thank you for the copy of your speech on the question of national\r\nimprovement, which I have read with great pleasure, and recognise in it\r\nthose powers of reasoning and persuasion of which I had formerly seen\r\nfrom you so many proofs. Yet, in candor, I must say it has not removed,\r\nin my mind, all the difficulties of the question. And I should really be\r\nalarmed at a difference of opinion with you, and suspicious of my own,\r\nwere it not that I have, as companions in sentiment, the Madisons, the\r\nMonroes, the Randolphs, the Macons, all good men and true, of primitive\r\nprinciples. In one sentiment of the speech I particularly concur. ‘If we\r\nhave a doubt relative to any power, we ought not to exercise it.’ When\r\nwe consider the extensive and deep-seated opposition to this assumption,\r\nthe conviction entertained by so many, that this deduction of powers by\r\nelaborate construction prostrates the rights reserved to the States, the\r\ndifficulties with which it will rub along in the course of its exercise;\r\nthat changes of majorities will be changing the system backwards and\r\nforwards, so that no undertaking under it will be safe; that there is\r\nnot a State in the Union which would not give the power willingly, by\r\nway of amendment, with some little guard, perhaps, against abuse; I\r\ncannot but think it would be the wisest course to ask an express grant\r\nof the power. A government held together by the bands of reason only,\r\nrequires much compromise of opinion; that things even salutary should\r\nnot be crammed down the throats of dissenting brethren, especially when\r\nthey may be put into a form to be willingly swallowed, and that a great\r\ndeal of indulgence is necessary to strengthen habits of harmony and\r\nfraternity. In such a case, it seems to me it would be safer and wiser\r\nto ask an express grant of the power. This would render its exercise\r\nsmooth and acceptable to all, and insure to it all the facilities which\r\nthe could contribute, to prevent that kind of abuse which all will fear,\r\nbecause all know it is so much practised in public bodies, I mean the\r\nbartering of votes. It would reconcile every one, if limited by the\r\nproviso, that the federal proportion of each State should be expended\r\nwithin the State. With this single security against partiality and\r\ncorrupt bargaining, I suppose there is not a State, perhaps not a man\r\nin the Union, who would not consent to add this to the powers of the\r\nGeneral Government. But age has weaned me from questions of this kind.\r\nMy delight is now in the passive occupation of reading; and it is\r\nwith great reluctance I permit my mind ever to encounter subjects of\r\ndifficult investigation. You have many years yet to come of vigorous\r\nactivity, and I confidently trust they will be employed in cherishing\r\nevery measure which may foster our brotherly union, and perpetuate a\r\nconstitution of government destined to be the primitive and precious\r\nmodel of what is to change the condition of man over the globe. With\r\nthis confidence, equally strong in your powers and purposes, I pray you\r\nto accept the assurance of my cordial esteem and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXXI.--TO MAJOR JOHN CARTWRIGHT, June 5,1824\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAJOR JOHN CARTWRIGHT.\r\n\r\nMonticello, June 5,1824.\r\n\r\nDear and Venerable Sir,\r\n\r\nI am much indebted for your kind letter of February the 29th, and for\r\nyour valuable volume on the English constitution. I have, read this with\r\npleasure and much approbation, and think it has deduced the constitution\r\nof the English nation from its rightful root, the Anglo-Saxon, it is\r\nreally wonderful, that so many able and learned men should have failed\r\nin their attempts to define it with correctness. No wonder then, that\r\nPaine, who thought more than he read, should have credited the great\r\nauthorities who have declared, that the will of Parliament is the\r\nconstitution of England. So Marbois, before the French revolution,\r\nobserved to me, that the Almanac Royal was the constitution of France.\r\nYour derivation of it from the Anglo-Saxons, seems to be made on\r\nlegitimate principles. Having driven out the former inhabitants of that\r\npart of the island called England, they became aborigines as to you, and\r\nyour lineal ancestors. They doubtless had a constitution; and although\r\nthey have not left it in a written formula, to the precise text of which\r\nyou may always appeal, yet they have left fragments of their history\r\nand laws, from which it may be inferred with considerable certainty.\r\nWhatever their history and laws show to have been practised with\r\napprobation, we may presume was permitted by their constitution;\r\nwhatever was not so practised, was not permitted. And although this\r\nconstitution was violated and set at nought by Norman force, yet force\r\ncannot change right. A perpetual claim was kept up by the nation, by\r\ntheir perpetual demand of a restoration of their Saxon laws; which shows\r\nthey were never relinquished by the will of the nation. In the pullings\r\nand haulings for these ancient rights, between the nation, and its kings\r\nof the races of Plantagenets, Tudors, and Stuarts, there was sometimes\r\ngain, and sometimes loss, until the final re-conquest of their rights\r\nfrom the Stuarts. The destitution and expulsion of this race broke the\r\nthread of pretended inheritance extinguished all regal usurpations, and\r\nthe nation reentered into all its rights; and although in their bill of\r\nrights they specifically reclaimed some only, yet the omission of the\r\nothers was no renunciation of the right to assume their exercise also,\r\nwhenever occasion should occur. The new King received no rights or\r\npowers, but those expressly granted to him. It has ever appeared to me,\r\nthat the difference between the whig and the tory of England is, that\r\nthe whig deduces his rights from the Anglo-Saxon source, and the tory\r\nfrom the Norman. And Hume, the great apostle of toryism, says in so many\r\nwords, (note AA to chapter 42,) that, in the reign of the Stuarts, ‘it\r\nwas the people who encroached upon the sovereign, not the sovereign who\r\nattempted, as is pretended, to usurp upon the people.’ This supposes the\r\nNorman usurpations to be rights in his successors. And again, (C. 159,)\r\n‘the Commons established a principle, which is noble in itself, and\r\nseems specious, but is belied by all history and experience, that the\r\npeople are the origin of all just power.’ And where else will this\r\ndegenerate son of science, this traitor to his fellow-men, find the\r\norigin of just powers, if not in the majority of the society? Will it be\r\nin the minority? Or in an individual of that minority?\r\n\r\nOur revolution commenced on more favorable ground. It presented us an\r\nalbum on which we were free to write what we pleased. We had no occasion\r\nto search into musty records, to hunt up royal parchments, or to\r\ninvestigate the laws and institutions of a semi-barbarous ancestry. We\r\nappealed to those of nature, and found them engraved on our hearts. Yet\r\nwe did not avail ourselves of all the advantages of our position. We had\r\nnever been permitted to exercise self-government. When forced to assume\r\nit, we were novices in its science. Its principles and forms had entered\r\nlittle into our former education. We established however some, although\r\nnot all its important principles. The constitutions of most of our\r\nStates assert, that all power is inherent in the people; that they may\r\nexercise it by themselves, in all cases to which they think themselves\r\ncompetent (as in electing their functionaries, executive and\r\nlegislative, and deciding by a jury of themselves, in all\r\njudiciary cases in which any fact is involved), or they may act by\r\nrepresentatives, freely and equally chosen; that it is their right and\r\nduty to be at all times armed; that they are entitled to freedom of\r\nperson, freedom of religion, freedom of property, and freedom of the\r\npress. In the structure of our legislatures, we think experience has\r\nproved the benefit of subjecting questions to two separate bodies of\r\ndeliberants; but in constituting these, natural right has been mistaken,\r\nsome making one of these bodies, and some both, the representatives of\r\nproperty instead of persons; whereas the double deliberation might be\r\nas well obtained without any violation of true principle, either by\r\nrequiring a greater age in one of the bodies, or by electing a proper\r\nnumber of representatives of persons, dividing them by lots into two\r\nchambers, and renewing the division at frequent intervals, in order\r\nto break up all cabals. Virginia, of which I am myself a native and\r\nresident, was not only the first of the States, but, I believe I may\r\nsay, the first of the nations of the earth, which assembled its wise men\r\npeaceably together to form a fundamental constitution, to commit it to\r\nwriting, and place it among their archives, where every one should be\r\nfree to appeal to its text. But this act was very imperfect. The other\r\nStates, as they proceeded successively to the same work, made\r\nsuccessive improvements; and several of them, still further corrected\r\nby experience, have, by conventions, still further amended their first\r\nforms. My own State has gone on so far with its _première ébauch_; but\r\nit is now proposing to call a convention for amendment. Among other\r\nimprovements, I hope they will adopt the subdivision of our counties\r\ninto wards. The former may be estimated at an average of twenty-four\r\nmiles square; the latter should be about six miles square each, and\r\nwould answer to the hundreds of your Saxon Alfred. In each of these\r\nmight be, 1. An elementary school. 2. A company of militia, with its\r\nofficers. 3. A justice of the peace and constable. 4. Each ward should\r\ntake care of their own poor. 5. Their own roads. 6. Their own police.\r\n7. Elect within themselves one or more jurors to attend the courts\r\nof justice. And, 8. Give in at their Folk-house, their votes for all\r\nfunctionaries reserved to their election. Each ward would thus be a\r\nsmall republic within itself, and every man in the State would thus\r\nbecome an acting member of the common government, transacting in person\r\na great portion of its rights and duties, subordinate indeed, yet\r\nimportant and entirely within his competence. The wit of man cannot\r\ndevise a more solid basis for a free, durable, and well-administered\r\nrepublic.\r\n\r\nWith respect to our State and federal governments, I do not think their\r\nrelations correctly understood by foreigners. They generally suppose\r\nthe former subordinate to the latter. But this is not the case. They are\r\nco-ordinate departments of one simple and integral whole. To the State\r\ngovernments, are reserved all legislation and administration, in affairs\r\nwhich concern their own citizens only, and to the federal government\r\nis given whatever concerns foreigners, or the citizens of other States;\r\nthese functions alone being made federal. The one is the domestic, the\r\nother the foreign branch of the same government; neither having control\r\nover the other, but within its own department. There are one or two\r\nexceptions only to this partition of power. But you may ask, if the two\r\ndepartments should claim each the same subject of power, where is the\r\ncommon umpire to decide ultimately between them? In cases of little\r\nimportance or urgency, the prudence of both parties will keep them\r\naloof from the questionable ground: but if it can neither be avoided nor\r\ncompromised, a convention of the States must be called, to ascribe the\r\ndoubtful power to that department which they may think best. You will\r\nperceive by these details, that we have not yet so far perfected our\r\nconstitutions as to venture to make them unchangeable. But still, in\r\ntheir present state, we consider them not otherwise changeable than by\r\nthe authority of the people, on a special election of representatives\r\nfor that purpose expressly: they are until then the _lex legum_.\r\n\r\nBut can they be made unchangeable? Can one generation bind another, and\r\nall others, in succession for ever? I think not. The Creator has made\r\nthe earth for the living, not the dead. Rights and powrers can only\r\nbelong to persons, not to things, not to mere matter, unendowed with\r\nwill. The dead are not even things. The particles of matter which\r\ncomposed their bodies, make part now of the bodies of other animals,\r\nvegetables, or minerals, of a thousand forms. To what then are attached\r\nthe rights and powers they held while in the form of men? A generation\r\nmay bind itself as long as its majority continues in life; when that\r\nhas disappeared, another majority is in place, holds all the rights\r\nand powers their predecessors once held, and may change their laws and\r\ninstitutions to suit themselves. Nothing then is unchangeable but the\r\ninherent and unalienable rights of man.\r\n\r\nI was glad to find in your book a formal contradiction, at length, of\r\nthe judiciary usurpation of legislative powers; for such the judges have\r\nusurped in their repeated decisions, that Christianity is a part of\r\nthe common law. The proof of the contrary, which you have adduced,\r\nis incontrovertible; to wit, that the common law existed while the\r\nAnglo-Saxons were yet Pagans, at a time when they had never yet heard\r\nthe name of Christ pronounced, or knew that such a character had ever\r\nexisted. But it may amuse you, to show when, and by what means,\r\nthey stole this law in upon us. In a case of _quare impedit_ in the\r\nYear-book, 34. H. 6. folio 38. (anno 1458,) a question was made, how far\r\nthe ecclesiastical law was to be respected in a common law court. And\r\nPrisot, Chief Justice, gives his opinion in these words. ‘_A tiel leis\r\nqu’ils de seint eglise ont enancien scripture, covient a nous a donner\r\ncredence; car ceo common ley stir quels touts manners leis sont fondes.\r\nEt auxy, Sir, nous sumus obliges de conustre lour ley de saint eglise:\r\net semblablement ils sont obliges de conustre nostre ley. Et, Sir, si\r\npoit apperer or a nous que Pevesque ad fait come un ordinary fera en\r\ntiel cas, adong nous devons ceo adju-ger bon,ou auterment nemy_,’ &c.\r\nSee S. C. Fitzh.Abr. Qu. imp. 89. Bro. Abr. Qu. imp. 12. Finch in his\r\nfirst book, c. 3. is the first afterwards who quotes this case, and\r\nmistakes it thus. ‘To such laws of the church as have warrant in holy\r\nscripture, our law giveth credence.’ And cites Prisot; mistranslating\r\n‘ancien scripture’ into ‘holy scripture.’ Whereas, Prisot palpably says,\r\n‘to such laws as those of holy church have in ancient writing, it is\r\nproper for us to give credence;’ to wit, to their ancient written laws.\r\nThis was in 1613, a century and a half after the dictum of Prisot.\r\nWingate, in 1658, erects this false translation into a maxim of the\r\ncommon law, copying the words of Finch, but citing Prisot. Wing. Max.\r\n3. and Sheppard, title, ‘Religion,’ in 1675, copies the same\r\nmistranslation, quoting the Y. B. Finch and Win-gate. Hale expresses\r\nit in these words; ‘Christianity is parcel of the laws of England.’ 1\r\nVentr. 293, 3 Keb. 607. But he quotes no authority. By these echoings\r\nand re-echoings from one to another, it had become so established in\r\n1728, that in the case of the King vs. Woolston, 2 Stra. 834, the court\r\nwould not suffer it to be debated, whether to write against Christianity\r\nwas punishable in the temporal court at common law. Wood, therefore,\r\n409, ventures still to vary the phrase and say, that all blasphemy\r\nand profaneness are offences by the common law; and cites 2 Stra.\r\nThen Blackstone, in 1763, IV. 59, repeats the words of Hale, that\r\n‘Christianity is part of the laws of England,’ citing Ventris and\r\nStrange. And finally, Lord Mansfield, with a little qualification, in\r\nEvans’s case, in 1767, says, that ‘the essential principles of revealed\r\nreligion are part of the common law.’ Thus ingulphing Bible, Testament,\r\nand all into the common law, without citing any authority. And thus we\r\nfind this chain of authorities hanging link by link, one upon another,\r\nand all ultimately on one and the same hook, and that a mistranslation\r\nof the words ‘ancien scripture,’ used by Prisot. Finch quotes Prisot;\r\nWingate does the same. Sheppard quotes Prisot, Finch, and Wingate.\r\nHale cites nobody. The court, in Woolston’s case, cite Hale. Wood cites\r\nWoolston’s case. Blackstone quotes Woolston’s case and Hale. And Lord\r\nMansfield, like Hale, ventures it on his own authority. Here I might\r\ndefy the best read lawyer to produce another scrip of authority for this\r\njudiciary forgery; and I might go on further to show, how some of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon priests interpolated into the text of Alfred’s laws, the\r\n20th, 21st, 22nd, and 23rd chapters of Exodus, and the 15th of the Acts\r\nof the Apostles, from the 23rd to the 29th verses. But this would lead\r\nmy pen and your patience too far. What a conspiracy this, between Church\r\nand State! Sing Tantarara, rogues all, rogues all, Sing Tantarara,\r\nrogues all!\r\n\r\nI must still add to this long and rambling letter, my acknowledgments\r\nfor your good wishes to the University we are now establishing in this\r\nState. There are some novelties in it. Of that of a professorship of\r\nthe principles of government, you express your approbation. They will be\r\nfounded in the rights of man. That of agriculture, I am sure, you will\r\napprove: and that also of Anglo-Saxon. As the histories and laws left us\r\nin that type and dialect, must be the text-books of the reading of the\r\nlearners, they will imbibe with the language their free principles\r\nof government. The volumes you have been so kind as to send, shall be\r\nplaced in the library of the University. Having at this time in England\r\na person sent for the purpose of selecting some Professors, a Mr.\r\nGilmer of my neighborhood, I cannot but recommend him to your patronage,\r\ncounsel, and guardianship, against imposition, misinformation, and the\r\ndeceptions of partial and false recommendations, in the selection\r\nof characters. He is a gentleman of great worth and correctness, my\r\nparticular friend, well educated in various branches of science, and\r\nworthy of entire confidence.\r\n\r\nYour age of eighty-four and mine of eighty-one years, insure us a speedy\r\nmeeting. We may then commune at leisure, and more fully, on the good and\r\nevil, which in the course of our long lives, we have.both witnessed; and\r\nin the mean time, I pray you to accept assurances of my high veneration\r\nand esteem for your person and character.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXXII.--TO MARTIN VAN BUREN, June 29, 1824\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MARTIN VAN BUREN.\r\n\r\nMonticello, June 29, 1824.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have to thank you for Mr. Pickering’s elaborate philippic against Mr.\r\nAdams, Gerry, Smith, and myself; and I have delayed the acknowledgment\r\nuntil I could read it and make some observations on it.\r\n\r\nI could not have believed, that for so many years, and to such a period\r\nof advanced age, he could have nourished passions so vehement and\r\nviperous. It appears, that for thirty years past, he has been\r\nindustriously collecting materials for vituperating the characters he\r\nhad marked for his hatred; some of whom certainly, if enmities towards\r\nhim had ever existed, had forgotten them all, or buried them in the\r\ngrave with themselves. As to myself, there never had been any thing\r\npersonal between us, nothing but the general opposition of party\r\nsentiment; and our personal intercourse had been that of urbanity, as\r\nhimself says. But it seems he has been all this time brooding over an\r\nenmity which I had never felt, and that with respect to myself, as well\r\nas others, he has been writing far and near, and in every direction, to\r\nget hold of original letters, where he could, copies, where he could\r\nnot, certificates and journals, catching at every gossipping story he\r\ncould hear of in any quarter, supplying by suspicions what he could find\r\nno where else, and then arguing on this motley farrago, as if\r\nestablished on gospel evidence. And while expressing his wonder,\r\n‘at the age of eighty-eight, the strong passions of Mr. Adams should not\r\nhave cooled ‘; that on the contrary, ‘they had acquired the mastery of\r\nhis soul,’ (p. 100 ;) that ‘where these were enlisted, no reliance\r\ncould be placed on his statements,’ (p. 104 ;) the facility and little\r\ntruth with which he could represent facts and occurrences, concerning\r\npersons who were the objects of his hatred, (p. 3 ;) that ‘he is\r\ncapable of making the grossest misrepresentations, and, from detached\r\nfacts, and often from bare suspicions, of drawing unwarrantable\r\ninferences,’ if suited to his purpose at the instant,’ (p. 174;) while\r\nmaking such charges, I say, on Mr. Adams, instead of his ‘_ecce homo_,’\r\n(p. 100;) how justly might we say to him, ‘_Mutato nomine, de te fabula\r\nnarratur_.’ For the assiduity and industry he has employed in his\r\nbenevolent researches after matter of crimination against us, I refer to\r\nhis pages 13, 14, 34, 36, 46, 71, 79, 90, bis. 92, 93, bis. 101, ter.\r\n104, 116, 118, 141, 143, 146,150,151,153, 168, 171, 172. That Mr.\r\nAdams’s strictures on him, written and pointed, should have excited some\r\nnotice on his part, was not perhaps to be wondered at. But the\r\nsufficiency of his motive for the large attack on me may be more\r\nquestionable. He says, (p. 4) ‘of Mr. Jefferson I should have said\r\nnothing, but for his letter to Mr. Adams, of October the 12th, 1823.’\r\nNow the object of that letter was to soothe the feelings of a friend,\r\nwounded by a publication which I thought an ‘outrage on private\r\nconfidence.’ Not a word or allusion in it respecting Mr. Pickering, nor\r\nwas it suspected that it would draw forth his pen in justification of\r\nthis infidelity, which he has, however, undertaken in the course of his\r\npamphlet, but more particularly in its conclusion.\r\n\r\nHe arraigns me on two grounds, my actions, and my motives. The very\r\nactions, however, which he arraigns, have been such as the great\r\nmajority of my fellow-citizens have approved. The approbation of Mr.\r\nPickering, and of those who thought with him, I had no right to expect.\r\nMy motives he chooses to ascribe to hypocrisy, to ambition, and a\r\npassion for popularity. Of these the world must judge between us. It\r\nis no office of his or mine. To that tribunal I have ever submitted\r\nmy actions and motives, without ransacking the Union for certificates,\r\nletters, journals, and gossiping tales, to justify myself and weary\r\nthem. Nor shall I do this on the present occasion, but leave still to\r\nthem these antiquated party diatribes, now newly revamped and paraded,\r\nas if they had not been already a thousand times repeated, refuted, and\r\nadjudged against him, by the nation itself. If no action is to be deemed\r\nvirtuous for which malice can imagine a sinister motive, then there\r\nnever was a virtuous action; no, not even in the life of our Savior\r\nhimself. But he has taught us to judge the tree by its fruit, and to\r\nleave motives to him who can alone see into them.\r\n\r\nBut whilst I leave to its fate the libel of Mr. Pickering, with the\r\nthousands of others like it, to which I have given no other answer than\r\na steady course of similar action, there are two facts or fancies of\r\nhis which I must set to rights. The one respects Mr. Adams, the\r\nother myself. He observes, that my letter of October the 12th, 1823,\r\nacknowledges the receipt of one from Mr. Adams, of September the 18th,\r\nwhich, having been written a few days after Cunningham’s publication, he\r\nsays was no doubt written to apologize to me for the pointed reproaches\r\nhe had uttered against me in his confidential letters to Cunningham.\r\nAnd thus having ‘no doubt’ of his conjecture, he considers it as proven,\r\ngoes on to suppose the contents of the letter (19, 22), makes it place\r\nMr. Adams at my feet suing for pardon, and continues to rant upon it,\r\nas an undoubted fact. Now I do most solemnly declare, that so far from\r\nbeing a letter of apology, as Mr. Pickering so undoubtingly assumes,\r\nthere was not a word or allusion in it respecting Cunningham’s\r\npublication.\r\n\r\nThe other allegation respecting myself, is equally false. In page 34,\r\nhe quotes Doctor Stuart, as having, twenty years ago, informed him that\r\nGeneral Washington, ‘when he became a private citizen,’ called me to\r\naccount for expressions in a letter to Mazzei, requiring, in a tone of\r\nunusual severity, an explanation of that letter. He adds of himself, ‘in\r\nwhat manner the latter humbled himself, and appeased the just resentment\r\nof Washington, will never be known, as some time after his death, the\r\ncorrespondence was not to be found, and a diary for an important period\r\nof his Presidency was also missing.’ The diary being of transactions\r\nduring his Presidency, the letter to Mazzei not known here until some\r\ntime after he became a private citizen, and the pretended correspondence\r\nof course after that, I know not why this lost diary and supposed\r\ncorrespondence are brought together here, unless for insinuations worthy\r\nof the letter itself. The correspondence could not be found, indeed,\r\nbecause it had never existed. I do affirm, that there never passed\r\na word, written or verbal, directly or indirectly, between General\r\nWashington and myself on the subject of that letter. He would never have\r\ndegraded himself so far as to take to himself the imputation in that\r\nletter on the ‘Samsons in combat.’ The whole story is a fabrication, and\r\nI defy the framers of it, and all mankind, to produce a scrip of a\r\npen between General Washington and myself on the subject, or any other\r\nevidence more worthy of credit than the suspicions, suppositions, and\r\npresumptions of the two persons here quoting and quoted for it. With\r\nDoctor Stuart I had not much acquaintance. I supposed him to be an\r\nhonest man, knew him to be a very weak one, and, like Mr. Pickering,\r\nvery prone to antipathies, boiling with party passions, and, under the\r\ndominion of these, readily welcoming fancies for facts. But, come the\r\nstory from whomsoever it might, it is an unqualified falsehood.\r\n\r\nThis letter to Mazzei has been a precious theme of crimination for\r\nfederal malice. It was a long letter of business, in which was inserted\r\na single paragraph only of political information as to the state of our\r\ncountry. In this information there was not one word which would not\r\nthen have been, or would not now be approved by every republican in\r\nthe United States, looking back to those times, as you will see by a\r\nfaithful copy now enclosed of the whole of what that letter said on\r\nthe subject of the United States, or of its government. This paragraph,\r\nextracted and translated, got into a Paris paper at a time when the\r\npersons in power there were laboring under very general disfavor, and\r\ntheir friends were eager to catch even at straws to buoy them up. ‘To\r\nthem, therefore, I have always imputed the interpolation of an entire\r\nparagraph additional to mine, which makes me charge my own country with\r\ningratitude and injustice to France. There was not a word in my letter\r\nrespecting France, or any of the proceedings or relations between this\r\ncountry and that. Yet this interpolated paragraph has been the burden of\r\nfederal calumny, has been constantly quoted by them, made the subject\r\nof unceasing and virulent abuse, and is still quoted, as you see, by Mr.\r\nPickering, (page 33,) as if it were genuine, and really written by me.\r\nAnd even Judge Marshall makes history descend from its dignity, and the\r\nermine from its sanctity, to exaggerate, to record, and to sanction this\r\nforgery. In the very last note of his book, he says, ‘A letter from\r\nMr. Jefferson to Mr. Mazzei, an Italian, was published in Florence, and\r\nrepublished in the Moniteur, with very severe strictures on the conduct\r\nof the United States.’ And instead of the letter itself, he copies\r\nwhat he says are the remarks of the editor, which are an exaggerated\r\ncommentary on the fabricated paragraph itself, and silently leaves to\r\nhis reader to make the ready inference that these were the sentiments of\r\nthe letter. Proof is the duty of the affirmative side. A negative cannot\r\nbe possibly proved. But, in defect of impossible proof of what was not\r\nin the original letter, I have its press-copy still in my possession. It\r\nhas been shown to several, and is open to any one who wishes to see it.\r\nI have presumed only that the interpolation was done in Paris. But I\r\nnever saw the letter in either its Italian or French dress, and it may\r\nhave been done here, with the commentary handed down to posterity by the\r\njudge. The genuine paragraph, re-translated through Italian and French\r\ninto English, as it appeared here in a federal paper, besides the\r\nmutilated hue which these translations and re-translations of it\r\nproduced generally, gave a mistranslation of a single word, which\r\nentirely perverted its meaning, and made it a pliant and fertile text of\r\nmisrepresentation of my political principles. The original, speaking of\r\nan Anglican, monarchical, and aristocratical party, which had sprung\r\nup since he had left us, states their object to be ‘to draw over us\r\nthe substance, as they had already done the forms of the British\r\ngovernment.’ Now the ‘forms’ here meant, were the levees, birth-days,\r\nthe pompous cavalcade to the State House on the meeting of Congress, the\r\nformal speech from the throne, the procession of Congress in a body to\r\nre-echo the speech in an answer, &c. &c. But the translator here, by\r\nsubstituting form in the singular number, for forms in the plural, made\r\nit mean the frame or organization of our government, or its form of\r\nlegislative, executive, and judiciary authorities, co-ordinate and\r\nindependent: to which form it was to be inferred that I was an enemy. In\r\nthis sense they always quoted it, and in this sense Mr. Pickering still\r\nquotes, it (pages 34, 35, 38), and countenances the inference. Now\r\nGeneral Washington perfectly understood what I meant by these forms,\r\nas they were frequent subjects of conversation between us. When, on my\r\nreturn from Europe, I joined the government in March, 1790, at New York,\r\nI was much astonished, indeed, at the mimicry I found established\r\nof royal forms and ceremonies, and more alarmed at the unexpected\r\nphenomenon, by the monarchical sentiments I heard expressed and openly\r\nmaintained in every company, and among others by the high members of the\r\ngovernment, executive and judiciary (General Washington alone excepted),\r\nand by a great part of the legislature, save only some members who had\r\nbeen of the old Congress, and a very few of recent introduction. I\r\ntook occasion, at various times, of expressing to General Washington my\r\ndisappointment at these symptoms of a change of principle, and that\r\nI thought them encouraged by the forms and ceremonies, which I found\r\nprevailing, not at all in character with the simplicity of republican\r\ngovernment, and looking as if wishfully to those of European courts.\r\nHis general explanations to me were, that when he arrived at New York\r\nto enter on the executive administration of the new government, he\r\nobserved to those who were to assist him, that placed as he was in an\r\noffice entirely new to him, unacquainted with the forms and ceremonies\r\nof other governments, still less apprized of those which might be\r\nproperly established here, and himself perfectly indifferent to all\r\nforms, he wished them to consider and prescribe what they should be; and\r\nthe task was assigned particularly to General Knox, a man of parade,\r\nand to Colonel Humphreys, who had resided some time at a foreign court.\r\nThey, he said, were the author’s of the present regulations, and that\r\nothers were proposed so highly strained, that he absolutely rejected\r\nthem. Attentive to the difference of opinion prevailing on this subject,\r\nwhen the term of his second election arrived, he called the Heads of\r\ndepartments together, observed to them the situation in which he had\r\nbeen at the commencement of the government, the advice he had taken, and\r\nthe course he had observed in compliance with it; that a proper occasion\r\nhad now arrived of revising that course, of correcting in it any\r\nparticulars not approved in experience; and he desired us to consult\r\ntogether, agree on any changes we should think for the better, and\r\nthat he should willingly conform to what we should advise. We met at\r\nmy office. Hamilton and myself agreed at once that there was too much\r\nceremony for the character of our government, and, particularly, that\r\nthe parade of the installation at New York ought not to be copied on the\r\npresent occasion, that the President should desire the Chief Justice to\r\nattend him at his chambers, that he should administer the oath of office\r\nto him in the presence of the higher officers of the government, and\r\nthat the certificate of the fact should be delivered to the Secretary\r\nof State to be recorded. Randolph and Knox differed from us, the\r\nlatter vehemently: they thought it not advisable to change any of the\r\nestablished forms, and we authorized Randolph to report our opinions to\r\nthe President. As these opinions were divided, and no positive advice\r\ngiven as to any change, no change was made. Thus the forms, which I had\r\ncensured in my letter to Mazzei, were perfectly understood by General\r\nWashington, and were those which he himself but barely tolerated. He had\r\nfurnished me a proper occasion for proposing their reformation, and, my\r\nopinion not prevailing, he knew I could not have meant any part of the\r\ncensure for him.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickering quotes too (page 34) the expression in the letter, of ‘the\r\nmen who were Samsons in the field, and Solomons in the council, but who\r\nhad had their heads shorn by the harlot England’ or, as expressed in\r\ntheir re-translation, the men who were Solomons in council, and Samsons\r\nin combat, but whose hair had been cut off by the whore England.’ Now\r\nthis expression also was perfectly understood by General Washington. He\r\nknew that I meant it for the Cincinnati generally, and that, from what\r\nhad passed between us at the commencement of that institution, I could\r\nnot mean to include him. When the first meeting was called for its\r\nestablishment, I was a member of the Congress then sitting at Annapolis.\r\nGeneral Washington wrote to me, asking my opinion on that proposition,\r\nand the course, if any, which I thought Congress would observe\r\nrespecting it. I wrote him frankly my own disapprobation of it; that I\r\nfound the members of Congress generally in the same sentiment; that\r\nI thought they would take no express notice of it, but that in all\r\nappointments of trust, honor, or profit, they would silently pass by all\r\ncandidates of that order, and give an uniform preference to others. On\r\nhis way to the first meeting in Philadelphia, which I think was in the\r\nspring of 1784, he called on me at Annapolis. It was a little after\r\ncandle-light, and he sat with me till after midnight, conversing, almost\r\nexclusively, on that subject. While he was feelingly indulgent to the\r\nmotives which might induce the officers to promote it, he concurred with\r\nme entirely in condemning it; and when I expressed an idea that, if the\r\nhereditary quality were suppressed, the institution might perhaps\r\nbe indulged during the lives of the officers now living, and who had\r\nactually served; ‘No,’ he said, ‘not a fibre of it ought, to be left, to\r\nbe an eye-sore to the public, a ground of dissatisfaction, and a line\r\nof separation between them and their country’: and he left me with a\r\ndetermination to use all his influence for its entire suppression. On\r\nhis return from the meeting, he called on me again, and related to me\r\nthe course the thing had taken. He. said, that, from the beginning,\r\nhe had used every endeavor to prevail on the officers to renounce the\r\nproject altogether, urging the many considerations which would render\r\nit odious to their fellow-citizens, and disreputable and injurious to\r\nthemselves; that he had at length prevailed on most of the old officers\r\nto reject it, although with great and warm opposition from others, and\r\nespecially the younger ones, among whom he named Colonel W. S. Smith\r\nas particularly intemperate. But that in this state of things, when he\r\nthought the question safe, and the meeting drawing to a close, Major\r\nL’Enfant arrived from France with a bundle of eagles, for which he had\r\nbeen sent there, with letters from the French officers who had served\r\nin. America, praying for admission into the order, and a solemn act of\r\ntheir King permitting them to wear its ensign. This, he said, changed\r\nthe face of matters at once, produced an entire revolution of sentiment,\r\nand turned the torrent so strongly in an opposite direction, that\r\nit could be no longer withstood: all he could then obtain, was a\r\nsuppression of the hereditary quality. He added, that it was the French\r\napplications, and respect for the approbation of the King, which saved\r\nthe establishment in its modified and temporary form. Disapproving thus\r\nof the institution as much as I did, and conscious that I knew him to do\r\nso, he could never suppose that I meant to include him among the Samsons\r\nin the field, whose object was to draw over us the form, as they\r\nmade the letter say, of the British government, and especially its\r\naristocractic member, an hereditary House of Lords. Add to this, that\r\nthe letter saying, ‘that two out of the three branches of legislature\r\nwere against us,’ was an obvious exception of him; it being well known\r\nthat the majorities in the two branches of Senate and Representatives\r\nwere the very instruments which carried, in opposition to the old and\r\nreal republicans, the measures which were the subjects of condemnation\r\nin this letter. General Washington, then, understanding perfectly what\r\nand whom I meant to designate, in both phrases, and that they could not\r\nhave any application or view to himself, could find in neither any cause\r\nof offence to himself; and therefore neither needed, nor ever asked any\r\nexplanation of them from me. Had it even been otherwise, they must know\r\nvery little of General Washington, who should believe to be within the\r\nlaws of his character what Doctor Stuart is said to have imputed to\r\nhim. Be this, however, as it may, the story is infamously false in\r\nevery article of it. My last parting with General Washington was at the\r\ninauguration of Mr. Adams, in March, 1797, and was warmly affectionate;\r\nand I never had any reason to believe any change on his part, as there\r\ncertainly was none on mine. But one session of Congress intervened\r\nbetween that and his death, the year following, in my passage to and\r\nfrom which, as it happened to be not convenient to call on him, I never\r\nhad another opportunity; and as to the cessation of correspondence\r\nobserved during that short interval, no particular circumstance occurred\r\nfor epistolary communication, and both of us were too much oppressed\r\nwith letter-writing, to trouble either the other, with a letter about\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that the federalists, pretending to be the exclusive\r\nfriends of General Washington, have ever done what they could to sink\r\nhis character, by hanging theirs on it, and by representing as the enemy\r\nof republicans him, who, of all men, is best entitled to the appellation\r\nof the father of that republic which they were endeavoring to subvert,\r\nand the republicans to maintain. They cannot deny, because the elections\r\nproclaimed the truth, that the great body of the nation approved the\r\nrepublican measures. General Washington was himself sincerely a friend\r\nto the republican principles of our constitution. His faith, perhaps,\r\nin its duration, might not have been as confident as mine; but he\r\nrepeatedly declared to me, that he was determined it should have a fair\r\nchance for success, and that he would lose the last drop of his blood in\r\nits support, against any attempt which, might be made to change it from\r\nits republican form. He made these declarations the oftener, because he\r\nknew my suspicions that Hamilton had other views, and he wished to quiet\r\nmy jealousies on this subject. For Hamilton frankly avowed, that he\r\nconsidered the British constitution, with all the corruptions of its\r\nadministration, as the most perfect model of government which had ever\r\nbeen devised by the wit of man; professing, however, at the same time,\r\nthat the spirit of this country was so fundamentally republican, that\r\nit would be visionary to think of introducing monarchy here, and that,\r\ntherefore, it was the duty of its administrators to conduct it on the\r\nprinciples their constituents had elected.\r\n\r\nGeneral Washington, after the retirement of his first cabinet, and the\r\ncomposition of his second, entirely federal, and at the head of which\r\nwas Mr. Pickering himself, had no opportunity of hearing both sides of\r\nany question. His measures, consequently, took more the hue of the party\r\nin whose hands he was. These measures were certainly not approved by the\r\nrepublicans; yet were they not imputed, to him, but to the counsellors\r\naround him; and his prudence so far restrained their impassioned course\r\nand bias, that no act of strong mark, during the remainder of his\r\nadministration, excited much dissatisfaction. He lived too short a time\r\nafter, and too much withdrawn from information, to correct the views\r\ninto which he had been deluded; and the continued assiduities of the\r\nparty drew him into the vortex of their intemperate career; separated\r\nhim still farther from his real friends, and excited him to actions and\r\nexpressions of dissatisfaction, which grieved them, but could not\r\nloosen their affections from him. They would not suffer the temporary\r\naberration to weigh against the immeasurable merits of his life; and\r\nalthough they tumbled his seducers from their places, they preserved his\r\nmemory embalmed in their hearts, with undiminished love and devotion;\r\nand there it for ever will remain embalmed, in entire oblivion of every\r\ntemporary thing which might cloud the glories of his splendid life. It\r\nis vain, then, for Mr. Pickering and his friends to endeavor to falsify\r\nhis character, by representing him as an enemy to republicans and\r\nrepublican principles, and as exclusively the friend of those who were\r\nso; and had he lived longer, he would have returned to his ancient and\r\nunbiassed opinions, would have replaced his confidence in those whom the\r\npeople approved and supported, and would have seen that they were only\r\nrestoring and acting on the principles of his own first administration.\r\n\r\nI find, my dear Sir, that I have written you a very long letter\r\nor rather a history. The civility of having sent me a copy of Mr.\r\nPickering’s diatribe, would scarcely justify its address to you. I do\r\nnot publish these things, because my rule of life has been never to\r\nharass the public with fendings and provings of personal slanders;\r\nand least of all would I descend into the arena of slander with such\r\na champion as Mr. Pickering. I have ever trusted to the justice and\r\nconsideration of my fellow-citizens, and have no reason to repent it,\r\nor to change my course. At this time of life, too, tranquillity is the\r\n_summum bonum_. But although I decline all newspaper controversy, yet\r\nwhen falsehoods have been advanced, within the knowledge of no one so\r\nmuch as myself, I have sometimes deposited a contradiction in the hands\r\nof a friend, which, if worth preservation, may, when I am no more, nor\r\nthose whom I might offend, throw light on history, and recall that into\r\nthe path of truth. And if of no other value, the present communication\r\nmay amuse you with anecdotes not known to every one.\r\n\r\nI had meant to have added some views on the amalgamation of parties, to\r\nwhich your favor of the 8th has some allusion; an amalgamation of name,\r\nbut not of principle. Tories are tories still, by whatever name they may\r\nbe called. But my letter is already too unmercifully long, and I close\r\nit here with assurances of my great esteem and respectful consideration.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXXIII.--TO EDWARD EVERETT, October 15, 1824\r\n\r\nTO EDWARD EVERETT.\r\n\r\nMonticello, October 15, 1824.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have yet to thank you for your O. B. K. oration, delivered in presence\r\nof General la Fayette. It is all excellent, much of it sublimely so,\r\nwell worthy of its author and his subject, of whom we may truly say, as\r\nwas said of Germanicus, ‘_Fruitur famâ sui_.’\r\n\r\nYour letter of September the 10th gave me the first information that\r\nmine to Major Cartwright had got into the newspapers; and the first\r\nnotice, indeed, that he had received it. I was a stranger to his person,\r\nbut not to his respectable and patriotic character. I received from him\r\na long and interesting letter, and answered it with frankness, going\r\nwithout reserve into several subjects, to which his letter had led,\r\nbut on which I did not suppose I was writing for the newspapers. The\r\npublication of a letter in such a case, without the consent of the\r\nwriter, is not a fair practice.\r\n\r\nThe part which you quote, may draw on me the host of judges and divines.\r\nThey may cavil, but cannot refute it. Those who read Prisot’s opinion\r\nwith a candid view to understand, and not to chicane it, cannot mistake\r\nits meaning. The reports in the Year-books were taken very short. The\r\nopinions of the judges were written down sententiously, as notes or\r\nmemoranda, and not with all the developement which they probably used in\r\ndelivering them. Prisot’s opinion, to be fully expressed, should be thus\r\nparaphrased. ‘To such laws as those of holy church have recorded, and\r\npreserved in their ancient books and writings, it is proper for us to\r\ngive credence; for so is, or so says, the common law, or law of the\r\nland, on which all manner of other laws rest for their authority, or are\r\nfounded; that is to say, the common law, or the law of the land common\r\nto us all, and established by the authority of us all, is that from\r\nwhich is derived the authority of all other special and subordinate\r\nbranches of law, such as the canon law, law merchant, law maritime,\r\nlaw of Gavelkind, Borough English, corporation laws, local customs and\r\nusages, to all of which the common law requires its judges to permit\r\nauthority in the special or local cases belonging to them. The evidence\r\nof these laws is preserved in their ancient treatises, books, and\r\nwritings, in like manner as our own common law itself is known, the\r\ntext-of its original enactments having been long lost, and its substance\r\nonly preserved in ancient and traditionary writings. And if it appears,\r\nfrom their ancient books, writings, and records, that the bishop, in\r\nthis case, according to the rules prescribed by these authorities, has\r\ndone what an ordinary would have done, in such case, then we should\r\nadjudge it good, otherwise not.’ To decide this question, they would\r\nhave to turn to the ancient writings and records of the canon law,\r\nin which they would find evidence of the laws of advowsons, _quare\r\nimpedit_, the duties of bishops and ordinaries, for which terms Prisot\r\ncould never have meant to refer them to the Old or New Testament, _les\r\nsaincts scriptures_, where surely they would not be found. A license\r\nwhich should permit ‘ancien scripture’ to be translated ‘holy\r\nscripture,’ annihilates at once all the evidence of language. With such\r\na license, we might reverse the sixth commandment into ‘Thou shalt not\r\nomit murder.’ It would be the more extraordinary in this case, where\r\nthe mistranslation was to effect the adoption of the whole code of the\r\nJewish and Christian laws into the text of our statutes, to convert\r\nreligious offences into temporal crimes, to make the breach of every\r\nreligious precept a subject of indictment, submit the question of\r\nidolatry, for example, to the trial of a jury, and to a court, its\r\npunishment, to the third and fourth generation of the offender. Do we\r\nallow to our judges this lumping legislation?\r\n\r\nThe term ‘common law,’ although it has more than one meaning, is\r\nperfectly definite, _secundum subjectam materiem_. Its most probable\r\norigin was on the conquest of the Heptarchy by Alfred, and the\r\namalgamation of their several codes of law into one, which became\r\ncommon to them all. The authentic text of these enactments has not been\r\npreserved; but their substance has been committed to many ancient\r\nbooks and writings, so faithfully as to have been deemed genuine from\r\ngeneration to generation, and obeyed as such by all. We have some\r\nfragments of them collected by Lambard, Wilkins, and others, but\r\nabounding with proofs of their spurious authenticity. Magna Charta\r\nis the earliest statute, the text of which has come down to us in an\r\nauthentic form, and thence downward we have them entire. We do not know\r\nexactly when the common law and statute law, the _lex scripta et non\r\nscripta_, began to be contra-distinguished, so as to give a second\r\nacceptation to the former term; whether before or after Prisot’s day, at\r\nwhich time we know that nearly two centuries and a half of statutes were\r\nin preservation. In later times, on the introduction of the chancery\r\nbranch of law, the term common law began to be used in a third sense, as\r\nthe correlative of chancery law. This, however, having been long after\r\nPrisot’s time, could not have been the sense in which he used the term.\r\nHe must have meant the ancient _lex, non scripta_, because, had he used\r\nit as inclusive of the _lex scripta_, he would have put his finger on\r\nthe statute which had enjoined on the judges a deference to the laws of\r\nholy church. But no such statute existing, he must have referred to the\r\ncommon law in the sense of a _lex non scripta_. Whenever, then, the term\r\ncommon law is used in either of these senses, and it is never employed\r\nin any other, it is readily known in which of them by the context and\r\nsubject matter under consideration; which, in the present case, leave no\r\nroom for doubt. I do not remember the occasion which led me to take up\r\nthis subject, while a practitioner of the law. But I know I went into\r\nit with all the research which a very copious law library enabled me to\r\nindulge; and I fear not for the accuracy of any of my quotations.\r\nThe doctrine might be disproved by many other and different topics of\r\nreasoning; but having satisfied myself of the origin of the forgery, and\r\nfound how, like a rolling snow-ball, it had gathered volume, I leave\r\nits further pursuit to those who need further proof, and perhaps I have\r\nalready gone further than the feeble doubt you expressed might require,\r\nI salute you with great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXXIV.--TO JOSEPH C. CABELL, January 11, 1825\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH C. CABELL.\r\n\r\nMonticello, January 11, 1825.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nWe are dreadfully nonplussed here by the non-arrival of our three\r\nProfessors. We apprehend that the idea of our opening on the 1st of\r\nFebruary prevails so much abroad (although we have always mentioned\r\nit doubtfully), as that the students will assemble on that day without\r\nawaiting the further notice which was promised. To send them away\r\nwill be discouraging, and to open an University without Mathematics or\r\nNatural Philosophy would bring on us ridicule and disgrace. We\r\ntherefore publish an advertisement, stating that on the arrival of these\r\nProfessors, notice will be given of the day of opening the institution.\r\n\r\nGovernor Barbour writes me hopefully of getting our fifty thousand\r\ndollars from Congress. The proposition has been originated in the House\r\nof Representatives, referred to the committee of claims, the chairman\r\nof which has prepared a very favorable report, and a bill conformable,\r\nassuming the repayment of all interest which the State has actually\r\npaid. The legislature will certainly owe to us the recovery of this\r\nmoney; for had they not given it in some measure the reverenced\r\ncharacter of a donation for the promotion of learning, it would never\r\nhave been paid. It is to be hoped, therefore, that the displeasure\r\nincurred by wringing it from them at the last session, will now give\r\nway to a contrary feeling, and even place us on a ground of some merit.\r\nShould this sentiment take place, and the arrival of our Professors, and\r\nfilling our dormitories with students on the 1st of February, encourage\r\nthem to look more favorably towards us, perhaps it might dispose them to\r\nenlarge somewhat their order on the same fund. You observe the Proctor\r\nhas stated in a letter accompanying our Report, that it will take about\r\ntwenty-five thousand dollars more than we have to finish the Rotunda.\r\nBesides this, an Anatomical theatre (costing about as much as one of our\r\nhotels, say about five thousand dollars,) is indispensable to the school\r\nof Anatomy. There cannot be a single dissection until a proper theatre\r\nis prepared, giving an advantageous view of the operation to those\r\nwithin, and effectually excluding observation from without. Either the\r\nadditional sums, therefore, of twenty-five thousand and five thousand\r\ndollars will be wanting, or we must be permitted to appropriate a part\r\nof the fifty thousand to a theatre, leaving the Rotunda unfinished for\r\nthe present. Yet I should think neither of these objects an equivalent\r\nfor renewing the displeasure of the legislature. Unless we can carry\r\ntheir hearty patronage with us, the institution can never flourish.\r\nI would not, therefore, hint at this additional aid, unless it were\r\nagreeable to our friends generally, and tolerably sure of being carried\r\nwithout irritation.\r\n\r\nIn your letter of December the 31st, you say my ‘hand-writing and my\r\nletters have great effect there,’ i.e. at Richmond. I am sensible, my\r\ndear Sir, of the kindness with which this encouragement is held up to\r\nme. But my views of their effect are very different. When I retired from\r\nthe administration of public affairs, I thought I saw some evidence that\r\nI retired with a good degree of public favor, and that my conduct in\r\noffice had been considered, by the one party at least, with approbation,\r\nand with acquiescence by the other. But the attempt, in which I have\r\nembarked so earnestly, to procure an improvement in the moral condition\r\nof my native State, although, perhaps, in other States it may have\r\nstrengthened good dispositions, it has assuredly weakened them within\r\nour own. The attempt ran foul of so many local interests, of so many\r\npersonal views, and so much ignorance, and I have been considered as\r\nso particularly its promoter, that I see evidently a great change of\r\nsentiment towards myself. I cannot doubt its having dissatisfied\r\nwith myself a respectable minority, if not a majority of the House of\r\nDelegates. I feel it deeply, and very discouragingly. Yet I shall not\r\ngive way. I have ever found in my progress through life, that, acting\r\nfor the public, if we do always what is right, the approbation denied in\r\nthe beginning will surely follow us in the end. It is from posterity we\r\nare to expect remuneration for the sacrifices we are making for their\r\nservice, of time, quiet, and good will. And I fear not the appeal. The\r\nmultitude of fine young men whom we shall redeem from ignorance, who\r\nwill feel that they owe to us the elevation of mind, of character, and\r\nstation they will be able to attain from the result of our efforts, will\r\ninsure their remembering us with gratitude. We will not, then, be ‘weary\r\nin well-doing.’ _Usque ad aras amicus tuus_,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXXV.--TO THOMAS JEFFERSON SMITH, February 21, 1825\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON TO THOMAS JEFFERSON SMITH.\r\n\r\nThis letter will, to you, be as one from the dead. The writer will be\r\nin the grave before you can weigh its counsels. Your affectionate and\r\nexcellent father has requested that I would address to you something\r\nwhich might possibly have a favorable influence on the course of life\r\nyou have to run, and I too, as a namesake, feel an interest in that\r\ncourse. Few words will be necessary, with good dispositions on your\r\npart. Adore God. Reverence and cherish your parents. Love your neighbor\r\nas yourself, and your country more than yourself. Be just.

The torrent of general opinion sets so strongly in favor\r\nof it as to be irresistible. And I suppose that even the opposition in\r\nCongress will hereafter be feeble and formal, unless something can be\r\ndone which may give a gleam of encouragement to our friends, or alarm\r\ntheir opponents in their fancied security. I learn from Richmond, that\r\nthose who think with us there are in a state of perfect dismay, not\r\nknowing what to do, or what to propose. Mr. Gordon, our representative,\r\nparticularly, has written to me in very desponding terms, not disposed\r\nto yield, indeed, but pressing for opinions and advice on the subject.\r\nI have no doubt you are pressed in the same way, and I hope you have\r\ndevised and recommended something to them. If you have, stop here and\r\nread no more, but consider all that follows as _non avenue_. I shall\r\nbe better satisfied to adopt implicitly any thing which you may have\r\nadvised, than any thing occurring to myself. For I have long ceased\r\nto think on subjects of this kind, and pay little attention to public\r\nproceedings. But if you have done nothing in it, then I risk for your\r\nconsideration what has occurred to me, and is expressed in the enclosed\r\npaper. Bailey’s propositions, which came to hand since I wrote the\r\npaper, and which I suppose to have come from the President himself, show\r\na little hesitation in the purposes of his party; and in that state of\r\nmind, a bolt shot critically may decide the contest, by its effect on\r\nthe less bold. The olive-branch held out to them at this moment may be\r\naccepted, and the constitution thus saved at a moderate sacrifice. I say\r\nnothing of the paper, which will explain itself. The following heads of\r\nconsideration, or some of them, may weigh in its favor.\r\n\r\nIt may intimidate the wavering. It may break the western coalition,\r\nby offering the same thing in a different form. It will be viewed with\r\nfavor in contrast with the Georgia opposition and fear of strengthening\r\nthat. It will be an example of a temperate mode of opposition in future\r\nand similar cases. It will delay the measure a year at least. It will\r\ngive us the chance of better times and of intervening accidents; and in\r\nno way place us in a worse than our present situation. I do not dwell on\r\nthese topics; your mind will develope them.\r\n\r\nThe first question is, whether you approve of doing any thing of the\r\nkind. If not, send it back to me, and it shall be suppressed; for I\r\nwould not hazard so important a measure against your opinion, nor even\r\nwithout its support. If you think it may be a canvass on which to put\r\nsomething good, make what alterations you please, and I will forward it\r\nto Gordon, under the most sacred injunctions that it shall be so used as\r\nthat not a shadow of suspicion shall fall on you or myself, that it\r\nhas come from either of us. But what you do, do as promptly as your\r\nconvenience will admit, lest it should be anticipated by something\r\nworse. Ever and affectionately yours,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The solemn Declaration and Protest of the Commonwealth of Virginia, on\r\nthe Principles of the Constitution of the United, States of America, and\r\non the Violations of them_.\r\n\r\nWe, the General Assembly of Virginia, on behalf and in the name of the\r\npeople thereof, do declare as follows.\r\n\r\nThe States in North America which confederated to establish their\r\nindependence on the government of Great Britain, of which Virginia was\r\none, became, on that acquisition, free and independent States, and, as\r\nsuch, authorized to constitute governments, each for itself, in such\r\nform as it thought best.\r\n\r\nThey entered into a compact (which is called the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States of America), by which they agreed to unite in a single\r\ngovernment as to their relations with each other, and with foreign\r\nnations, and as to certain other articles particularly specified.\r\nThey retained at the same time, each to itself, the other rights of\r\nindependent government, comprehending mainly their domestic interests.\r\n\r\nFor the administration of their federal branch, they agreed to appoint,\r\nin conjunction, a distinct set of functionaries, legislative, executive,\r\nand judiciary, in the manner settled in that compact: while to each,\r\nseverally and of course, remained its original right of appointing, each\r\nfor itself, a separate set of functionaries, legislative, executive,\r\nand judiciary, also, for administering the domestic branch of their\r\nrespective governments.\r\n\r\nThese two sets of officers, each independent of the other, constitute\r\nthus a whole of government, for each State separately; the powers\r\nascribed to the one, as specifically made federal, exercised over\r\nthe whole, the residuary powers, retained to the other, exercisable\r\nexclusively over its particular State, foreign herein, each to the\r\nothers, as they were before the original compact.\r\n\r\nTo this construction of government and distribution of its powers, the\r\nCommonwealth of Virginia does religiously and affectionately adhere,\r\nopposing, with equal fidelity and firmness, the usurpation of either set\r\nof functionaries on the rightful powers of the other.\r\n\r\nBut the federal branch has assumed in some cases, and claimed in others,\r\na right of enlarging its own powers by constructions, inferences, and\r\nindefinite deductions from those directly given, which this Assembly\r\ndoes declare to be usurpations of the powers retained to the independent\r\nbranches, mere interpolations into the compact, and direct infractions\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nThey claim, for example, and have commenced the exercise of a right to\r\nconstruct roads, open canals, and effect other internal improvements\r\nwithin the territories and jurisdictions exclusively belonging to the\r\nseveral States, which this Assembly does declare has not been given to\r\nthat branch by the constitutional compact, but remains to each State\r\namong its domestic and unalienated powers, exercisable within itself and\r\nby its domestic authorities alone.\r\n\r\nThis Assembly does further disavow, and declare to be most false and\r\nunfounded, the doctrine, that the compact, in authorizing its federal\r\nbranch to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises to pay\r\nthe debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the\r\nUnited States, has given them thereby a power to do whatever they may\r\nthink, or pretend, would promote the general welfare, which construction\r\nwould make that, of itself, a complete government, without limitation\r\nof powers; but that the plain sense and obvious meaning were, that they\r\nmight levy the taxes necessary to provide for the general welfare, by\r\nthe various acts of power therein specified and delegated to them, and\r\nby no others.\r\n\r\nNor is it admitted, as has been said, that the people of these States,\r\nby not investing their federal branch with all the means of bettering\r\ntheir condition, have denied to themselves any which may effect that\r\npurpose; since, in the distribution of these means, they have given to\r\nthat branch those which belong to its department, and to the States have\r\nreserved separately the residue which belong to them separately: and\r\nthus by the organization of the two branches taken together, have\r\ncompletely secured the first object of human association, the full\r\nimprovement of their condition, and reserved to themselves all the\r\nfaculties of multiplying their own blessings.\r\n\r\nWhilst the General Assembly thus declares the rights retained by the\r\nStates, rights which they have never yielded, and which this State\r\nwill never voluntarily yield, they do not mean to raise the banner of\r\ndisaffection, or of separation from their sister States, co-parties with\r\nthemselves to this compact. They know and value too highly the blessings\r\nof their Union, as to foreign nations and questions arising among\r\nthemselves, to consider every infraction as to be met by actual\r\nresistance. They respect too affectionately the opinions of those\r\npossessing the same rights, under the same instrument, to make every\r\ndifference of construction a ground of immediate rupture. They would,\r\nindeed, consider such a rupture as among the greatest calamities which\r\ncould befall them; but not the greatest. There is yet one greater,\r\nsubmission to a government of unlimited powers. It is only when the\r\nhope of avoiding this shall become absolutely desperate, that further\r\nforbearance could not be indulged. Should a majority of the co-parties,\r\ntherefore, contrary to the expectation and hope of this Assembly,\r\nprefer, at this time, acquiescence in these assumptions of power by the\r\nfederal member of the government, we will be patient and suffer much,\r\nunder the confidence that time, ere it be too late, will prove to them\r\nalso the bitter consequences in which that usurpation will involve us\r\nall. In the mean while, we will breast with them, rather than separate\r\nfrom them, every misfortune, save that only of living under a government\r\nof unlimited powers. We owe every other sacrifice to ourselves, to our\r\nfederal brethren, and to the world at large, to pursue with temper and\r\nperseverance the great experiment which shall prove that man is capable\r\nof living in society, governing itself by laws self-imposed, and\r\nsecuring to its members the enjoyment of life, liberty, property, and\r\npeace; and further to show, that even when the government of its choice\r\nshall manifest a tendency to degeneracy, we are not at once to despair\r\nbut that the will and the watchfulness of its sounder parts will reform\r\nits aberrations, recall it to original and legitimate principles, and\r\nrestrain it within the rightful limits of self-government. And these are\r\nthe objects of this Declaration and Protest.\r\n\r\nSupposing then, that it might be for the good of the whole, as some of\r\nits co-States seem to think, that the power of making roads and canals\r\nshould be added to those directly given to the federal branch, as more\r\nlikely to be systematically and beneficially directed, than by the\r\nindependent action of the several States, this Commonwealth, from\r\nrespect to these opinions, and a desire of conciliation with its\r\nco-States, will consent, in concurrence with them, to make this\r\naddition, provided it be done regularly by an amendment of the compact,\r\nin the way established by that instrument, and provided also, it be\r\nsufficiently guarded against abuses, compromises, and corrupt practices,\r\nnot only of possible, but of probable occurrence.\r\n\r\nAnd as a further pledge of the sincere and cordial attachment of this\r\nCommonwealth to the union of the whole, so far as has been consented\r\nto by the compact called ‘The Constitution of the United States of\r\nAmerica,’ (construed according to the plain and ordinary meaning of its\r\nlanguage, to the common intendment of the time, and of those who framed\r\nit;) to give also to all parties and authorities, time for reflection\r\nand for consideration, whether, under a temperate view of the possible\r\nconsequences, and especially of the constant obstructions which an\r\nequivocal majority must ever expect to meet, they will still prefer the\r\nassumption of this power rather than its acceptance from the free will\r\nof their constituents; and to preserve peace in the mean while, we\r\nproceed to make it the duty of our citizens, until the legislature shall\r\notherwise and ultimately decide, to acquiesce under those acts of\r\nthe federal branch of our government which we have declared to be\r\nusurpations, and against which, in point of right, we do protest as null\r\nand void, and never to be quoted as precedents of right.\r\n\r\nWe therefore do enact, and be it enacted by the General Assembly of\r\nVirginia, that all citizens of this Commonwealth, and persons and\r\nauthorities within the same, shall pay full obedience at all times to\r\nthe acts which may be passed by the Congress of the United States, the\r\nobject of which shall be the construction of post-roads, making canals\r\nof navigation, and maintaining the same, in any part of the United\r\nStates, in like manner as if the said acts were, _totidem verbis_,\r\npassed by the legislature of this Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXXVII.--TO WILLIAM B. GILES, December 25, 1825\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM B. GILES.\r\n\r\nMonticello, December 25, 1825.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of the 15th was received four days ago. It found me engaged\r\nin what I could not lay aside till this day.\r\n\r\nFar advanced in my eighty-third year, worn down with infirmities which\r\nhave confined me almost entirely to the house for seven or eight\r\nmonths past, it afflicts me much to receive appeals to my memory for\r\ntransactions so far back as that which is the subject of your letter.\r\nMy memory is indeed become almost a blank, of which no better proof can\r\nprobably be given you than by my solemn protestation, that I have not\r\nthe least recollection of your intervention between Mr. John Q. Adams\r\nand myself, in what passed on the subject of the embargo. Not the\r\nslightest trace of it remains in my mind. Yet I have no doubt of the\r\nexactitude of the statement in your letter. And the less, as I recollect\r\nthe interview with Mr. Adams, to which the previous communications which\r\nhad passed between him and yourself were probably and naturally the\r\npreliminary. That interview I remember well; not indeed in the very\r\nwords which passed between us, but in their substance, which was of a\r\ncharacter too awful, too deeply engraved in my mind, and influencing too\r\nmaterially the course I had to pursue, ever to be forgotten. Mr. Adams\r\ncalled on me pending the embargo, and while endeavors were making to\r\nobtain its repeal. He made some apologies for the call, on the ground of\r\nour not being then in the habit of confidential communications, but that\r\nthat which he had then to make, involved too seriously the interest of\r\nour country not to overrule all other considerations with him, and make\r\nit his duty to reveal it to myself particularly. I assured him there was\r\nno occasion for any apology for his visit; that, on the contrary,\r\nhis communications would be thankfully received, and would add a\r\nconfirmation the more to my entire confidence in the rectitude\r\nand patriotism of his conduct and principles. He spoke then of the\r\ndissatisfaction of the eastern portion of our confederacy with the\r\nrestraints of the embargo then existing, and their restlessness\r\nunder it. That there was nothing which might not be attempted, to rid\r\nthemselves of it. That he had information of the most unquestionable\r\ncertainty, that certain citizens of the Eastern States (I think he\r\nnamed Massachusetts particularly) were in negotiation with agents of the\r\nBritish government, the object of which was an agreement that the New\r\nEngland States should take no further part in the war then going on;\r\nthat, without formally declaring their separation from the Union of the\r\nStates, they should withdraw from all aid and obedience to them,\r\nthat their navigation and commerce should be free from restraint and\r\ninterruption by the British; that they should be considered and treated\r\nby them as neutrals, and as such might conduct themselves towards both\r\nparties; and, at the close of the war, be at liberty to rejoin the\r\nconfederacy. He assured me that there was imminent danger that the\r\nconvention would take place; that the temptations were such as might\r\ndebauch many from their fidelity to the Union; and that, to enable\r\nits friends to make head against it, the repeal of the embargo was\r\nabsolutely necessary. I expressed a just sense of the merit of this\r\ninformation, and of the importance of the disclosure to the safety\r\nand even the salvation of our country: and however reluctant I was to\r\nabandon the measure (a measure which persevered in a little longer, we\r\nhad subsequent and satisfactory assurance would have effected its object\r\ncompletely), from that moment, and influenced by that information, I saw\r\nthe necessity of abandoning it, and instead of effecting our purpose by\r\nthis peaceful weapon, we must fight it out, or break the Union. I then\r\nrecommended to my friends to yield to the necessity of a repeal of the\r\nembargo, and to endeavor to supply its place by the best substitute, in\r\nwhich they could procure a general concurrence.\r\n\r\nI cannot too often repeat, that this statement is not pretended to be\r\nin the very words which passed; that it only gives faithfully the\r\nimpression remaining on my mind. The very words of a conversation are\r\ntoo transient and fugitive to be so long retained in remembrance. But\r\nthe substance was too important to be forgotten, not only from the\r\nrevolution of measures it obliged me to adopt, but also from the\r\nrenewals of it in my memory on the frequent occasions I have had of\r\ndoing justice to Mr. Adams, by repeating this proof of his fidelity to\r\nhis country, and of his superiority over all ordinary considerations\r\nwhen the safety of that was brought into question.\r\n\r\nWith this best exertion of a waning memory which I can command, accept\r\nassurances of my constant and affectionate friendship and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXXVIII.--TO WILLIAM B. GILES, December 26, 1825\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM B. GILES.\r\n\r\nMonticello, December 26, 1825.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI wrote you a letter yesterday, of which you will be free to make what\r\nuse you please. This will contain matters not intended for the public\r\neye. I see, as you do, and with the deepest affliction, the rapid\r\nstrides with which the federal branch of our government is advancing\r\ntowards the usurpation of all the rights reserved to the States, and the\r\nconsolidation in itself of all powers, foreign and domestic; and that\r\ntoo, by constructions which, if legitimate, leave no limits to their\r\npower. Take together the decisions of the federal court, the doctrines\r\nof the President, and the misconstructions of the constitutional compact\r\nacted on by the legislature of the federal branch, and it is but too\r\nevident, that the three ruling branches of that department are in\r\ncombination to strip their colleagues, the State authorities, of the\r\npowers reserved by them, and to exercise themselves all functions,\r\nforeign and domestic. Under the power to regulate commerce, they assume\r\nindefinitely that also over agriculture and manufactures, and call it\r\nregulation to take the earnings of one of these branches of industry,\r\nand that too the most depressed, and put them into the pockets of the\r\nother, the most flourishing of all. Under the authority to establish\r\npost-roads, they claim that of cutting down mountains for the\r\nconstruction of roads, of digging canals, and aided by a little\r\nsophistry on the words ‘general welfare,’ a right to do, not only the\r\nacts to effect that, which are specifically enumerated and permitted,\r\nbut whatsoever they shall think or pretend will be for the general\r\nwelfare. And what is our resource for the preservation of the\r\nconstitution? Reason and argument? You might as well reason and argue\r\nwith the marble columns encircling them. The representatives chosen by\r\nourselves? They are joined in the combination, some from incorrect views\r\nof government, some from corrupt ones, sufficient, voting together,\r\nto outnumber the sound parts; and with majorities only of one, two, or\r\nthree, bold enough to go forward in defiance. Are we then to stand\r\nto our arms, with the hot-headed Georgian? No. That must be the last\r\nresource, not to be thought of until much longer and greater sufferings.\r\nIf every infraction of a compact of so many parties is to be resisted at\r\nonce, as a dissolution of it, none can ever be formed which would last\r\none year. We must have patience and longer endurance then with our\r\nbrethren while under delusion; give them time for reflection and\r\nexperience of consequences; keep ourselves in a situation to profit by\r\nthe chapter of accidents; and separate from our companions only when the\r\nsole alternatives left, are the dissolution of our Union with them, or\r\nsubmission to a government without limitation of powers. Between these\r\ntwo evils, when we must make a choice, there can be no hesitation. But\r\nin the mean while, the States should be watchful to note every material\r\nusurpation on their rights; to denounce them as they occur in the most\r\nperemptory terms; to protest against them as wrongs to which our present\r\nsubmission shall be considered, not as acknowledgments or precedents\r\nof right, but as a temporary yielding to the lesser evil, until their\r\naccumulation shall overweigh that of separation. I would go still\r\nfurther, and give to the federal member, by a regular amendment of the\r\nconstitution, a right to make roads and canals of intercommunication\r\nbetween the States, providing sufficiently against corrupt practices in\r\nCongress (log-rolling, &c.), by declaring that the federal proportion\r\nof each State of the monies so employed, shall be in works within\r\nthe State, or elsewhere with its consent, and with a due _salvo_ of\r\njurisdiction. This is the course which I think safest and best as yet.\r\nYou ask my opinion of the propriety of giving publicity to what is\r\nstated in your letter, as having passed between Mr. John Q. Adams and\r\nyourself. Of this no one can judge but yourself. It is one of those\r\nquestions which belong to the forum of feeling. This alone can decide\r\non the degree of confidence implied in the disclosure; whether under no\r\ncircumstances it was to be communicated to others. It does not seem to\r\nbe of that character, or at all to wear that aspect. They are historical\r\nfacts, which belong to the present, as well as future times. I\r\ndoubt whether a single fact, known to the world, will carry as clear\r\nconviction to it, of the correctness of our knowledge of the treasonable\r\nviews of the federal party of that day, as that disclosed by this, the\r\nmost nefarious and daring attempt to dissever the Union, of which the\r\nHartford Convention was a subsequent chapter: and both of these having\r\nfailed, consolidation becomes the first chapter of the next book of\r\ntheir history. But this opens with a vast accession of strength from\r\ntheir younger recruits, who, having nothing in them of the feelings or\r\nprinciples of ‘76, now look to a single and splendid government of an\r\naristocracy, founded on banking institutions, and monied incorporations\r\nunder the guise and cloak of their favored branches of manufactures,\r\ncommerce, and navigation, riding and ruling over the plundered ploughman\r\nand beggared yeomanry. This will be to them a next best blessing to the\r\nmonarchy of their first aim, and perhaps the surest stepping-stone to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI learn with great satisfaction that your school is thriving well, and\r\nthat you have at its head a truly classical scholar. He is one of three\r\nor four whom I can hear of in the State. We were obliged the last\r\nyear to receive shameful Latinists into the classical school of the\r\nUniversity; such as we will certainly refuse as soon as we can get from\r\nbetter schools a sufficiency of those properly instructed to form a\r\nclass. We must get rid of this Connecticut Latin, of this barbarous\r\nconfusion of long and short syllables, which renders doubtful whether we\r\nare listening to a reader of Cherokee, Shawnee, Iroquois, or what. Our\r\nUniversity has been most fortunate in the five Professors procured from\r\nEngland. A finer selection could not have been made. Besides their\r\nbeing of a grade of science which has left little superior behind, the\r\ncorrectness of their moral character, their accommodating dispositions,\r\nand zeal for the prosperity of the institution, leave us nothing more\r\nto wish. I verily believe that as high a degree of, education can now be\r\nobtained here, as in the country they left. And a finer set of youths I\r\nnever saw assembled for instruction. They committed some irregularities\r\nat first, until they learned the lawful length of their tether; since\r\nwhich it has never been transgressed in the smallest degree. A great\r\nproportion of them are severely devoted to study, and I fear not to say,\r\nthat within twelve or fifteen years from this time, a majority of the\r\nrulers of our State will have been educated here. They shall carry hence\r\nthe correct principles of our day, and you may count assuredly that they\r\nwill exhibit their country in a degree of sound respectability it has\r\nnever known, either in our days, or those of our forefathers. I cannot\r\nlive to see it. My joy must only be that of anticipation. But that you\r\nmay see it in full fruition, is the probable consequence of the twenty\r\nyears I am ahead of you in time, and is the sincere prayer of your\r\naffectionate and constant friend,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXXIX.--TO CLAIBORNE W. GOOCH, January 9, 1826\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CLAIBORNE W. GOOCH.\r\n\r\nMonticello, January 9, 1826.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have duly received your favor of December the 31st, and fear, with\r\nyou, all the evils which the present lowering aspect of our political\r\nhorizon so ominously portends. That at some future day, which I hoped\r\nto be very distant, the free principles of our government might change,\r\nwith the change of circumstances, was to be expected. But I certainly\r\ndid not expect that they would not over-live the generation which\r\nestablished them. And what I still less expected was, that my favorite\r\nwestern country was to be made the instrument of change. I had ever\r\nand fondly cherished the interests of that country, relying on it as a\r\nbarrier against the degeneracy of public opinion from our original and\r\nfree principles. But the bait of local interests, artfully prepared\r\nfor their palate, has decoyed them from their kindred attachments,\r\nto alliances alien to them. Yet, although I have little hope that the\r\ntorrent of consolidation can be withstood, I should not be for giving up\r\nthe ship without efforts to save her. She lived well through the first\r\nsquall, and may weather the present one. But, Dear Sir, I am not the\r\nchampion called for by our present dangers; _Non tali auxilio, nee\r\ndefensoribus istis, tempus eget_.’ A waning body, a waning mind,\r\nand waning memory, with habitual ill health, warn me to withdraw and\r\nrelinquish the arena to younger and abler athletes. I am sensible\r\nmyself, if others are not, that this is my duty. If my distant friends\r\nknow it not, those around me can inform them that they should not, in\r\nfriendship, wish to call me into conflicts, exposing only the decays\r\nwhich nature has inscribed among her unalterable laws, and injuring the\r\ncommon cause by a senile and puny defence.\r\n\r\nI will, however, say one word on the subject. The South Carolina\r\nresolutions, Van Buren’s motion, and above all Bailey’s propositions,\r\nshow that other States are coming forward on the subject, and better for\r\nany one to take the lead than Virginia, where opposition is considered\r\nas common-place, and a mere matter of form and habit. We shall see what\r\nour co-States propose, and before the close of the session we may shape\r\nour own course more understandingly.\r\n\r\nAccept the assurance of my great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXC.--TO [ANONYMOUS], January 21, 1826\r\n\r\n\r\nMonticello, January 21, 1826.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of January the 15th is received, and I am entirely\r\nsensible of the kindness of the motives which suggested the caution it\r\nrecommended. But I believe what I have done is the only thing I could\r\nhave done with honor or conscience. Mr. Giles requested me to state a\r\nfact which he knew himself, and of which he knew me to be possessed.\r\nWhat use he intended to make of it I knew not, nor had I a right to\r\ninquire, or to indicate any suspicion that he would make an unfair one.\r\nThat was his concern, not mine, and his character was sufficient to\r\nsustain the responsibility for it. I knew, too, that if an uncandid use\r\nshould be made of it, there would be found those who would so prove it.\r\nIndependent of the terms of intimate friendship on which Mr. Giles and\r\nmyself have ever lived together, the world’s respect entitled him to\r\nthe justice of my testimony to any truth he might call for; and how that\r\ntestimony should connect me with whatever he may do or write hereafter,\r\nand with his whole career, as you apprehend, is not understood by me.\r\nWith his personal controversies I have nothing to do. I never took any\r\npart in them, or in those of any other person. Add to this, that the\r\nstatement I have given him on the subject of Mr. Adams, is entirely\r\nhonorable to him in every sentiment and fact it contains. There is not\r\na word in it which I would wish to recall. It is one which Mr. Adams\r\nhimself might willingly quote, did he need to quote any thing. It was\r\nsimply, that during the continuance of the embargo, Mr. Adams informed\r\nme of a combination (without naming any one concerned in it), which had\r\nfor its object a severance of the Union, for a time at least. That Mr.\r\nAdams and myself not being then in the habit of mutual consultation and\r\nconfidence, I considered it as the stronger proof of the purity of his\r\npatriotism, which was able to lift him above all party passions when\r\nthe safety of his country was endangered. Nor have I kept this honorable\r\nfact to myself. During the late canvass, particularly, I had more\r\nthan one occasion to quote it to persons who were expressing opinions\r\nrespecting him, of which this was a direct corrective. I have never\r\nentertained for Mr. Adams any but sentiments of esteem and respect; and\r\nif we have not thought alike on political subjects, I yet never doubted\r\nthe honesty of his opinions, of which the letter in question, if\r\npublished, will be an additional proof. Still, I recognise your\r\nfriendship in suggesting a review of it, and am glad of this, as of\r\nevery other occasion, of repeating to you the assurance of my constant\r\nattachment and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXCI.--TO JAMES MADISON, February 17,1826\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nMonticello, February 17,1826.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nImmediately on seeing the overwhelming vote of the House of\r\nRepresentatives against giving us another dollar, I rode to the\r\nUniversity and desired Mr. Brockenbrough to engage in nothing new, to\r\nstop every thing on hand which could be done without, and to employ all\r\nhis force and funds in finishing the circular room for the books, and\r\nthe Anatomical theatre. These cannot be done without; and for these\r\nand all our debts, we have funds enough. But I think it prudent then to\r\nclear the decks thoroughly, to see how we shall stand, and what we\r\nmay accomplish further. In the mean time, there have arrived for us in\r\ndifferent ports of the United States, ten boxes of books, from Paris,\r\nseven from London, and from Germany I know not how many; in all,\r\nperhaps, about twenty-five boxes. Not one of these can be opened until\r\nthe book-room is completely finished, and all the shelves ready to\r\nreceive their charge directly from the boxes, as they shall be opened.\r\nThis cannot be till May. I hear nothing definitive of the three thousand\r\ndollars duty of which we are asking the remission from Congress. In the\r\nselection of our Law Professor, we must be rigorously attentive to his\r\npolitical principles. You will recollect, that, before the Revolution,\r\nCoke Littleton was the universal elementary book of law students, and\r\na sounder whig never wrote, nor of profounder learning in the orthodox\r\ndoctrines of the British constitution, or in what were called English\r\nliberties. You remember also that our lawyers were then all whigs. But\r\nwhen his black-letter text, and uncouth but cunning learning got out of\r\nfashion, and the honied Mansfieldism of Blackstone became the students’\r\nhornbook, from that moment, that profession (the nursery of our\r\nCongress) began to slide into toryism, and nearly all the young brood\r\nof lawyers now are of that hue. They suppose themselves, indeed, to be\r\nwhigs, because they no longer know what whigism or republicanism means.\r\nIt is in our seminary that that vestal flame is to be kept alive; it is\r\nthence it is to spread anew over our own and the sister States. If we\r\nare true and vigilant in our trust, within a dozen or twenty years\r\na majority of our own legislature will be from our school, and many\r\ndisciples will have carried its doctrines home with them to their\r\nseveral States, and will have leavened thus the whole mass. New York has\r\ntaken strong ground in vindication of the constitution; South Carolina\r\nhad already done the same. Although I was against our leading, I am\r\nequally against omitting to follow in the same line, and backing them\r\nfirmly; and i hope that yourself or some other will mark out the track\r\nto be pursued by us.\r\n\r\nYou will have seen in the newspapers some proceedings in the\r\nlegislature, which have cost me much mortification. My own debts had\r\nbecome considerable, but not beyond the effect of some lopping of\r\nproperty, which would have been little felt, when our friend ---- gave\r\nme the coup de grace. Ever since that I have been paying twelve hundred\r\ndollars a year interest on his debt, which, with my own, was absorbing\r\nso much of my annual income, as that the maintenance of my family was\r\nmaking deep and rapid inroads on my capital, and had already done it.\r\nStill, sales at a fair price would leave me competently provided. Had\r\ncrops and prices for several years been such as to maintain a steady\r\ncompetition of substantial bidders at market, all would have been safe.\r\nBut the long succession of years of stunted crops, of reduced prices,\r\nthe general prostration of the farming business, under levies for the\r\nsupport of manufacturers, &c, with the calamitous fluctuations of\r\nvalue in our paper medium, have kept agriculture in a state of abject\r\ndepression, which has peopled the western States by silently breaking\r\nup those on the Atlantic, and glutted the land-market, while it drew off\r\nits bidders. In such a state of things, property has lost its character\r\nof being a resource for debts. Highland in Bedford, which, in the days\r\nof our plethory, sold readily for from fifty to one hundred dollars the\r\nacre (and such sales were many then), would not now sell for more than\r\nfrom ten to twenty dollars, or one quarter or one fifth of its former\r\nprice. Reflecting on these things, the practice occurred to me, of\r\nselling, on fair valuation, and by way of lottery, often resorted to\r\nbefore the Revolution to effect large sales, and still in constant usage\r\nin every State for individual as well as corporation purposes. If it is\r\npermitted in my case, my lands here alone, with the mills, he, will pay\r\nevery thing, and leave me Monticello and a farm free. If refused, I must\r\nsell every thing here, perhaps considerably in Bedford, move thither\r\nwith my family, where I have not even a log hut to put my head into, and\r\nwhether ground for burial, will depend on the depredations which,\r\nunder the form of sales, shall have been committed on my property. The\r\nquestion then with me was, _Utrum horum?_ But why afflict you with\r\nthese details? Indeed, I cannot tell, unless pains are lessened by\r\ncommunication with a friend. The friendship which has subsisted between\r\nus, now half a century, and the harmony of our political principles and\r\npursuits, have been sources of constant happiness to me through that\r\nlong period. And if I remove beyond the reach of attentions to the\r\nUniversity, or beyond the bourne of life itself, as I soon must, it is a\r\ncomfort to leave that institution under your care, and an assurance\r\nthat it will not be wanting. It has also been a great solace to me, to\r\nbelieve that you are engaged in vindicating to posterity the course we\r\nhave pursued for preserving to them, in all their purity, the blessings\r\nof self-government, which we had assisted too in acquiring for them. If\r\never the earth has beheld a system of administration conducted with a\r\nsingle and steadfast eye to the general interest and happiness of those\r\ncommitted to it, one which, protected by truth, can never know reproach,\r\nit is that to which our lives have been devoted. To myself you have\r\nbeen a pillar of support through life. Take care of me when dead, and be\r\nassured that I shall leave with you my last affections.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n     [The following paper it is deemed proper to insert, as well\r\n     because of the explanation it contains of the reasons which\r\n     led the author to ask permission of the legislature to sell\r\n     his property by lottery, as of its otherwise interesting\r\n     character.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOUGHTS ON LOTTERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a common idea that games of chance are immoral. But what is\r\nchance? Nothing happens in this world without a cause. If we know the\r\ncause, we do not call it chance; but if we do not know it, we say it was\r\nproduced by chance. If we see a loaded die turn its lightest side up,\r\nwe know the cause, and that it is not an effect of chance; but whatever\r\nside an unloaded die turns up, not knowing the cause, we say it is\r\nthe effect of chance. Yet the morality of a thing cannot depend on our\r\nknowledge or ignorance of its cause. Not knowing why a particular side\r\nof an unloaded die turns up, cannot make the act of throwing it, or of\r\nbetting on it, immoral. If we consider games of chance immoral, then\r\nevery pursuit of human industry is immoral, for there is not a single\r\none that is not subject to chance; not one wherein you do not risk a\r\nloss for the chance of some gain. The navigator, for example, risks\r\nhis ship in the hope (if she is not lost in the voyage) of gaining an\r\nadvantageous freight. The merchant risks his cargo to gain a better\r\nprice for it. A landholder builds a house on the risk of indemnifying\r\nhimself by a rent. The hunter hazards his time and trouble in the hope\r\nof killing game. In all these pursuits, you stake some one thing against\r\nanother which you hope to win. But the greatest of all gamblers is the\r\nfarmer. He risks the seed he puts into the ground, the rent he pays for\r\nthe ground itself, the year’s labor on it, and the wear and tear of his\r\ncattle and gear, to win a crop, which the chances of too much or too\r\nlittle rain, and general uncertainties of weather, insects, waste, &c.\r\noften make a total or partial loss. These, then, are games of chance.\r\nYet so far from being immoral, they are indispensable to the existence\r\nof man, and every one has a natural right to choose for his pursuit such\r\none of them as he thinks most likely to furnish him subsistence. Almost\r\nall these pursuits of chance produce something useful to society. But\r\nthere are some which produce nothing, and endanger the well-being of the\r\nindividuals engaged in them, or of others depending on them. Such are\r\ngames with cards, dice, billiards, &c. And although the pursuit of them\r\nis a matter of natural right, yet society, perceiving the irresistible\r\nbent of some of its members to pursue them, and the ruin produced by\r\nthem to the families depending on these individuals, consider it as a\r\ncase of insanity, _quoad hoc_, step in to protect the family and the\r\nparty himself, as in other cases of insanity, infancy, imbecility, &c,\r\nand suppress the pursuit altogether, and the natural right of following\r\nit. There are some other games of chance, useful on certain occasions,\r\nand injurious only when carried beyond their useful bounds. Such are\r\ninsurances, lotteries, raffles, &tc. These they do not suppress, but\r\ntake their regulation under their own discretion. The insurance of\r\nships on voyages is a vocation of chance, yet useful, and the right to\r\nexercise it therefore is left free. So of houses against fire, doubtful\r\ndebts, the continuance of a particular life, and similar cases. Money is\r\nwanting for an useful undertaking, as a school, &c. for which a direct\r\ntax would be disapproved. It is raised therefore by a lottery, wherein\r\nthe tax is laid on the willing only, that is to say, on those who can\r\nrisk the price of a ticket without sensible injury, for the possibility\r\nof a higher prize. An article of property, insusceptible of division at\r\nall, or not without great diminution of its worth, is sometimes of so\r\nlarge value as that no purchaser can be found, while the owner owes\r\ndebts, has no other means of payment, and his creditors no other chance\r\nof obtaining it, but by its sale at a full and fair price. The lottery\r\nis here a salutary instrument for disposing of it, where many run small\r\nrisks for the chance of obtaining a high prize. In this way, the great\r\nestate of the late Colonel Byrd (in 1756) was made competent to pay his\r\ndebts, which, had the whole been brought into the market at once, would\r\nhave overdone the demand, would have sold at half or quarter the value,\r\nand sacrificed the creditors, half or three fourths of whom would have\r\nlost their debts. This method of selling was formerly very much resorted\r\nto, until it was thought to nourish too much a spirit of hazard. The\r\nlegislature Were therefore induced, not to suppress it altogether, but\r\nto take it under their own special regulation. This they did, for the\r\nfirst time, by their act of 1769, c.17., before which time, every person\r\nexercised the right freely; and since which time, it is made unlawful\r\nbut when approved and authorized by a special act of the legislature.\r\n\r\nSince then, this right of sale, by way of lottery, has been exercised\r\nonly under the discretion of the legislature. Let us examine the\r\npurposes for which they have allowed it in practice, not looking beyond\r\nthe date of our independence.\r\n\r\n1. It was for a long time an item of the standing revenue of the State.\r\n\r\n1813. c. 1. § 3 An act imposing taxes for the support of government, and\r\nc. 2. § 10.\r\n\r\n1814. Dec. c. 1. § 3. 1814. Feb. c. 1. § 3. 1818. c. 1. § 1. 1819. c. 1.\r\n1820. c. 1.\r\n\r\nThis then is a declaration by the nation, that an act was not immoral,\r\nof which they were in the habitual use themselves as a part of the\r\nregular means of supporting the government: the tax on the vender of\r\ntickets was their share of the profits, and if their share was innocent,\r\nhis could not be criminal.\r\n\r\n2. It has been abundantly permitted, to raise money by lottery for the\r\npurposes of schools; and in this, as in many other cases, the lottery\r\nhas been permitted to retain a part of the money (generally from ten to\r\nfifteen per cent.) for the use to which the lottery has been applied.\r\nSo that while the adventurers paid one hundred dollars for tickets, they\r\nreceived back eighty-five or ninety dollars only, in the form of prizes,\r\nthe remaining ten or fifteen being the tax levied on them, with their\r\nown consent. Examples are.\r\n\r\n1784. c. 34. Authorizing the city of Williamsburg to raise £2000 for a\r\ngrammar school.\r\n\r\n1789. c. 68. For Randolph Academy, £1000.\r\n\r\n1789. c. 73.

To enable---------to complete a literary\r\nwork.*\r\n\r\n* I found such an act, but not noting it at the time, I have not been\r\nable to find it again. But there is such an one.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen, then, that every vocation in life is subject to the\r\ninfluence of chance; that so far from being rendered immoral by the\r\nadmixture of that ingredient, were they abandoned on that account, man\r\ncould no longer subsist; that, among them, every one has a natural\r\nright to choose that which he thinks most likely to give him comfortable\r\nsubsistence; but that while the greater number of these pursuits are\r\nproductive of something which adds to the necessaries and comforts of\r\nlife, others again, such as cards, dice, &ic, are entirely unproductive,\r\ndoing good to none, injury to many, yet so easy, and so seducing in\r\npractice to men of a certain constitution of mind, that they cannot\r\nresist the temptation, be the consequences what they may; that in this\r\ncase, as in those of insanity, idiocy, infancy, &c, it is the duty of\r\nsociety to take them under its protection, even against their own acts,\r\nand to restrain their right of choice of these pursuits, by suppressing\r\nthem entirely; that there are others, as lotteries particularly, which,\r\nalthough liable to chance also, are useful for many purposes, and are\r\ntherefore retained and placed under the discretion of the legislature,\r\nto be permitted or refused according to the circumstances of every\r\nspecial case, of which they are to judge: that between the years 1782\r\nand 1820, a space of thirty-eight years only, we have observed seventy\r\ncase’s, where the permission of them has been found useful by the\r\nlegislature, some of which are in progress at this time. These cases\r\nrelate to the emolument of the whole State, to local benefits of\r\neducation, of navigation, of roads, of counties, towns, religious\r\nassemblies, private societies, and of individuals under particular\r\ncircumstances which may claim indulgence or favor. The latter is the\r\ncase now submitted to the legislature, and the question is, whether the\r\nindividual soliciting their attention, or his situation, may merit\r\nthat degree of consideration, which will justify the legislature in\r\npermitting him to avail himself of the mode of selling by lottery, for\r\nthe purpose of paying his debts.\r\n\r\nThat a fair price cannot be obtained by sale in the ordinary way, and\r\nin the present depressed state of agricultural industry, is well known.\r\nLands in this State will not now sell for more than a third or fourth of\r\nwhat they would have brought a few years ago, perhaps at the very time\r\nof the contraction of the debts for which they are now to be sold.\r\nThe low price in foreign markets, for a series of years past, of\r\nagricultural produce, of wheat generally, of tobacco most commonly, and\r\nthe accumulation of duties on the articles of consumption not produced\r\nwithin our State, not only disable the farmer or planter from adding to\r\nhis farm by purchase, but reduce him to sell his own, and remove to the\r\nwestern country, glutting the market he leave’s, while he lessens the\r\nnumber of bidders. To be protected against this sacrifice is the object\r\nof the present application, and whether the applicant has any particular\r\nclaim to this protection, is the present question.\r\n\r\nHere the answer must be left to others. It is not for me to give it. I\r\nmay, however, more readily than others, suggest the offices in which I\r\nhave served. I came of age in 1764, and was soon put into the nomination\r\nof justices of the county in which I live, and at the first election\r\nfollowing I became one of its representatives in the legislature.\r\n\r\nI was thence sent to the old Congress.\r\n\r\nThen employed two years, with Mr. Pendleton and Mr. Wythe, on the\r\nrevisal and reduction to a single code of the whole body of the British\r\nstatutes, the acts of our Assembly, and certain parts of the common law.\r\n\r\nThen elected Governor.\r\n\r\nNext to the legislature, and to Congress again.\r\n\r\nSent to Europe as Minister Plenipotentiary.\r\n\r\nAppointed Secretary of State to the new government.\r\n\r\nElected Vice President, and\r\n\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, a Visitor and Rector of the University.\r\n\r\nIn these different offices, with scarcely any interval between them, I\r\nhave been in the public service now sixty-one years; and during the far\r\ngreater part of the time, in foreign countries or in other States. Every\r\none knows how inevitably a Virginia estate, goes to ruin, when the owner\r\nis so far distant as to be unable to pay attention to it himself; and\r\nthe more especially, when the line of his employment is of a character\r\nto abstract and alienate his mind entirely from the knowledge necessary\r\nto good, and even to saving management.\r\n\r\nIf it were thought worth while to specify any particular services\r\nrendered, I would refer to the specification of them made by the\r\nlegislature itself in their Farewell Address, on my retiring from\r\nthe Presidency, February, 1809. [This will be found in 2 Pleasant’s\r\nCollection, page 144.] There is one, however, not therein specified, the\r\nmost important in its consequences, of any transaction in any portion\r\nof my life; to wit, the head I personally made against the federal\r\nprinciples and proceedings, during the administration of Mr. Adams.\r\nTheir usurpations and violations of the constitution at that period, and\r\ntheir majority in both Houses of Congress, were so great, so decided,\r\nand so daring, that after combating their aggressions, inch by inch,\r\nwithout being able in the least to check their career, the republican\r\nleaders thought it would be best for them to give up their useless\r\nefforts there, go home, get into their respective legislatures, embody\r\nwhatever of resistance they could be formed into, and if ineffectual, to\r\nperish there as in the last ditch. All, therefore, retired, leaving\r\nMr. Gallatin alone in the House of Representatives, and myself in the\r\nSenate, where I then presided as Vice-President. Remaining at our posts,\r\nand bidding defiance to the brow-beatings and insults by which they\r\nendeavored to drive us off also, we kept the mass of republicans in\r\nphalanx together, until the legislatures could be brought up to the\r\ncharge; and nothing on earth is more certain, than that if myself\r\nparticularly, placed by my office of Vice-President at the head of the\r\nrepublicans, had given way and withdrawn from my post, the republicans\r\nthroughout the Union would have given up in despair, and the cause\r\nwould have been lost for ever. By holding on, we obtained time for the\r\nlegislatures to come up with their weight; and those of Virginia\r\nand Kentucky particularly, but more especially the former, by their\r\ncelebrated resolutions, saved the constitution, at its last gasp. No\r\nperson who was not a witness of the scenes of that gloomy period, can\r\nform any idea of the afflicting persecutions and personal indignities we\r\nhad to brook. They saved our country however. The spirits of the people\r\nwere so much subdued and reduced to despair by the X. Y. Z. imposture,\r\nand other stratagems and machinations, that they would have sunk into\r\napathy and monarchy, as the only form of government which could maintain\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nIf legislative services are worth mentioning, and the stamp of\r\nliberality and equality, which was necessary to be impressed on our laws\r\nin the first crisis of our birth as a nation, was of any value, they\r\nwill find that the leading and most important laws of that day were\r\nprepared by myself, and carried chiefly by my efforts; supported,\r\nindeed, by able and faithful coadjutors from the ranks of the House,\r\nvery effective as seconds, but who would not have taken the field as\r\nleaders.\r\n\r\nThe prohibition of the further importation of slaves, was the first of\r\nthese measures in time.\r\n\r\nThis was followed by the abolition of entails, which broke up the\r\nhereditary and high-handed aristocracy, which, by accumulating immense\r\nmasses of property in single lines of families, had divided our country\r\ninto two distinct orders, of nobles and plebeians.\r\n\r\nBut further to complete the equality among our citizens so essential to\r\nthe maintenance of republican government, it was necessary to abolish\r\nthe principle of primogeniture. I drew the law of descents, giving equal\r\ninheritance to sons and daughters which made a part of the revised code.\r\n\r\nThe attack on the establishment of a dominant religion, was first made\r\nby myself. It could be carried at first only by a suspension of salaries\r\nfor one year, by battling it again at the next session for another year,\r\nand so from year to year, until the public mind was ripened for the bill\r\nfor establishing religious freedom, which I had prepared for the revised\r\ncode also. This was at length established permanently, and by the\r\nefforts chiefly of Mr. Madison, being myself in Europe at the time that\r\nwork was brought forward.\r\n\r\nTo these particular services, I think I might add the establishment of\r\nour University, as principally my work, acknowledging at the same time,\r\nas I do, the great assistance received from my able colleagues of the\r\nVisitation. But my residence in the vicinity threw, of course, on me\r\nthe chief burthen of the enterprise, as well of the buildings, as of\r\nthe general organization and care of the whole. The effect of this\r\ninstitution on the future fame, fortune, and prosperity of our country,\r\ncan as yet be seen but at a distance. But an hundred well educated\r\nyouths, which it will turn out annually, and ere long, will fill all\r\nits offices with men of superior qualifications, and raise it from its\r\nhumble state to an eminence among its associates which it has never yet\r\nknown; no, not in its brightest days. That institution is now qualified\r\nto raise its youth to an order of science unequalled in any other State;\r\nand this superiority will be the greater from the free range of mind\r\nencouraged there, and the restraint imposed at other seminaries by the\r\nshackles of a domineering hierarchy, and a bigoted adhesion to ancient\r\nhabits. Those now on the theatre of affairs will enjoy the ineffable\r\nhappiness of seeing themselves succeeded by sons of a grade of science\r\nbeyond their own ken. Our sister States will also be repairing to the\r\nsame fountains of instruction, will bring hither their genius to be\r\nkindled at our fire, and will carry back the fraternal affections\r\nwhich, nourished by the same alma mater, will knit us to them by the\r\nindissoluble bonds of early personal friendships. The good Old Dominion,\r\nthe blessed mother of us all, will then raise her head with pride among\r\nthe nations, will present to them that splendor of genius which she\r\nhas ever possessed, but has too long suffered to rest uncultivated\r\nand unknown, and will become a centre of ralliance to the States whose\r\nyouths she has instructed, and, as it were, adopted.\r\n\r\nI claim some share in the merits of this great work of regeneration. My\r\nwhole labors, now for many years, have been devoted to it, and I stand\r\npledged to follow it up through the remnant of life remaining to me. And\r\nwhat remuneration do I ask? Money from the treasury? Not a cent. I ask\r\nnothing from the earnings or labors of my fellow-citizens. I wish no\r\nman’s comforts to be abridged for the enlargement of mine. For the\r\nservices rendered on all occasions, I have been always paid to my full\r\nsatisfaction. I never wished a dollar more than what the law had fixed\r\non. My request is, only to be permitted to sell my own property freely\r\nto pay my own debts. To sell it, I say, and not to sacrifice it, not\r\nto have it gobbled up by speculators to make fortunes for themselves,\r\nleaving unpaid those who have trusted to my good faith, and myself\r\nwithout resource in the last and most helpless stage of life. If\r\npermitted to sell it in a way which will bring me a fair price, all will\r\nbe honestly and honorably paid, and a competence left for myself, and\r\nfor those who look to me for subsistence. To sell it in a way which will\r\noffend no moral principle, and expose none to risk but the willing, and\r\nthose wishing to be permitted to take the chance of gain. To give me, in\r\nshort, that permission which you often allow to others for purposes not\r\nmore moral.\r\n\r\nWill it be objected, that although not evil in itself, it may, as a\r\nprecedent, lead to evil? But let those who shall quote the precedent\r\nbring their case within the same measure. Have they, as in this case,\r\ndevoted three-score years and one of their lives, uninterruptedly, to\r\nthe service of their country? Have the times of those services been as\r\ntrying as those which have embraced our Revolution, our transition from\r\na colonial to a free structure of government? Have the stations of their\r\ntrial been of equal importance? Has the share they have borne in holding\r\ntheir new government to its genuine principles, been equally marked?\r\nAnd has the cause of the distress, against which they seek a remedy,\r\nproceeded, not merely from themselves, but from errors of the public\r\nauthorities, disordering the circulating medium, over which they had\r\nno control, and which have, in fact, doubled and trebled debts, by\r\nreducing, in that proportion, the value of the property which was to pay\r\nthem? If all these circumstances, which characterize the present case,\r\nhave taken place in theirs also, then follow the precedent. Be assured,\r\nthe cases will be so rare as to produce no embarrassment, as never to\r\nsettle into an injurious habit. The single feature of a sixty years’\r\nservice, as no other instance of it has yet occurred in our country, so\r\nit probably never may again. And should it occur, even once and again,\r\nit will not impoverish your treasury, as it takes nothing from that, and\r\nasks but a simple permission, by an act of natural right, to do one of\r\nmoral justice.\r\n\r\nIn the ‘Thoughts on Lotteries,’ the following paper is referred to. It\r\nis here copied to spare the trouble of seeking for the-book.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Farewell Address To Th: Jefferson, President Of The United States_.\r\n\r\n[Agreed to by both Houses, February 7, 1809.]\r\n\r\nSir, The General Assembly of your native State cannot close their\r\nsession, without acknowledging your services in the office which you are\r\njust about to lay down, and bidding you a respectful and affectionate\r\nfarewell.\r\n\r\nWe have to thank you for the model of an administration conducted on\r\nthe purest principles of republicanism; for pomp and state laid aside;\r\npatronage discarded; internal taxes abolished; a host of superfluous\r\nofficers disbanded; the monarchic maxim that ‘a national debt is a\r\nnational blessing,’ renounced, and more than thirty-three millions of\r\nour debt discharged; the native right to nearly one hundred millions\r\nof acres of our national domain extinguished; and, without the guilt or\r\ncalamities of conquest, a vast and, fertile region added to our country,\r\nfar more extensive than her original possessions, bringing along with\r\nit the Mississippi and the port of Orleans, the trade of the west to the\r\nPacific Ocean, and in the intrinsic value of the land itself, a source\r\nof permanent and almost inexhaustible revenue. These are points in your\r\nadministration which the historian will not fail to seize, to expand,\r\nand teach posterity to dwell upon with delight. Nor will he forget our\r\npeace with the civilized world, preserved through a season of uncommon\r\ndifficulty and trial; the good-will cultivated with the unfortunate\r\naborigines of our country, and the civilization humanely extended among\r\nthem; the lesson taught the inhabitants of the coast of Barbary, that\r\nwe have the means of chastising their piratical encroachments, and\r\nawing them into justice; and that theme, on which, above all others, the\r\nhistoric genius will hang with rapture, the liberty of speech and of the\r\npress, preserved inviolate, without which genius and science are given\r\nto man in vain.\r\n\r\nIn the principles on which you have administered the government, we see\r\nonly the continuation and maturity of the same virtues and abilities,\r\nwhich drew upon you in your youth the resentment of Dunmore. From the\r\nfirst brilliant and happy moment of your resistance to foreign tyranny,\r\nuntil the present day, we mark with pleasure and with gratitude the same\r\nuniform, consistent character, the same warm and devoted attachment\r\nto liberty and the republic, the same Roman love of your country, her\r\nrights, her peace, her honor, her prosperity.\r\n\r\nHow blessed will be the retirement into which you are about to go! How\r\ndeservedly blessed will it be! For you carry with you the richest of all\r\nrewards, the recollection of a life well spent in the service of your\r\ncountry, and proofs the most decisive, of the love, the gratitude, the\r\nveneration of your countrymen.\r\n\r\nThat your retirement may be as happy as your life has been virtuous and\r\nuseful; that our youth may see, in the blissful close of your days, an\r\nadditional inducement to form themselves on your model, is the devout\r\nand earnest prayer of your fellow-citizens who compose the General\r\nAssembly of Virginia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXCII.--TO JOHN QUINCY ADAMS, March 30, 1826\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN QUINCY ADAMS.\r\n\r\nMonticello, March 30, 1826.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI am thankful for the very interesting message and documents of\r\nwhich you have been so kind as to send me a copy, and will state my\r\nrecollections as to the particular passage of the message to which you\r\nask my attention. On the conclusion of peace, Congress, sensible of\r\ntheir right to assume independence, would not condescend to ask its\r\nacknowledgment from other nations, yet were willing, by some of the\r\nordinary international transactions, to receive what would imply that\r\nacknowledgment. They appointed commissioners, therefore, to propose\r\ntreaties of commerce to the principal nations of Europe. I was then\r\na member of Congress, was of the committee appointed to prepare\r\ninstructions for the commissioners, was, as you suppose, the draughtsman\r\nof those actually agreed to, and was joined with your father and Doctor\r\nFranklin to carry them into execution. But the stipulations making\r\npart of these instructions, which respected privateering, blockades,\r\ncontraband, and freedom of the fisheries, were not original conceptions\r\nof mine. They had before been suggested by Doctor Franklin, in some\r\nof his papers in possession of the public, and had I think, been\r\nrecommended in some letter of his to Congress I happen only to have\r\nbeen the inserter of them in the first public act which gave the formal\r\nsanction of a public authority. We accordingly proposed our treaties,\r\ncontaining these stipulations, to the principal governments of Europe.\r\nBut we were then just emerged from a subordinate condition; the\r\nnations had as yet known nothing of us and had not yet reflected on the\r\nrelations which it might be their interest to establish with us. Most of\r\nthem, therefore, listened to our propositions with coyness and reserve;\r\nold Frederic alone closing with us without hesitation. The negotiator of\r\nPortugal, indeed, signed a treaty with us, which his government did\r\nnot ratify, and Tuscany was near a final agreement. Becoming sensible,\r\nhowever, ourselves, that we should do nothing with the greater powers,\r\nwe thought it better not to hamper our country with engagements to those\r\nof less significance, and suffered our powers to expire without closing\r\nany other negotiation. Austria soon after became desirous of a treaty\r\nwith us, and her ambassador pressed it often on me; but our commerce\r\nwith her being no object, I evaded her repeated invitations. Had these\r\ngovernments been then apprized of the station we should so soon occupy\r\namong nations, all, I believe, would have met us promptly and with\r\nfrankness. These principles would then have been established with all,\r\nand from being the conventional law with us alone, would have slid into\r\ntheir engagements with one another, and become general. These are\r\nthe facts within my recollection. They have not yet got into written\r\nhistory; but their adoption by our southern brethren will bring them\r\ninto observance, and make them, what they should be, a part of the law\r\nof the world and of the reformation of principles for which they will be\r\nindebted to us. I pray you to accept the homage of my friendly and high\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXCIII.--TO MR. WEIGHTMAN, June 24, 1826\r\n\r\nTO MR. WEIGHTMAN.\r\n\r\nMonticello, June 24, 1826.\r\n\r\nRespected Sir,\r\n\r\nThe kind invitation I receive from you, on the part of the citizens of\r\nthe city of Washington, to be present with them at their celebration\r\non the fiftieth anniversary of American Independence, as one of the\r\nsurviving signers of an instrument pregnant with our own, and the\r\nfate of the world, is most flattering to myself, and heightened by the\r\nhonorable accompaniment proposed for the comfort of such a journey. It\r\nadds sensibly to the sufferings of sickness, to be deprived by it of a\r\npersonal participation in the rejoicings of that day. But acquiescence\r\nis a duty, under circumstances not placed among those we are permitted\r\nto control. I should indeed, with peculiar delight, have met and\r\nexchanged there congratulations personally with the small band, the\r\nremnant of that host of worthies, who joined with us on that day, in\r\nthe bold and doubtful election we were to make for our country, between\r\nsubmission or the sword; and to have enjoyed with them the consolatory\r\nfact, that our fellow-citizens, after half a century of experience and\r\nprosperity, continue to approve the choice we made. May it be to the\r\nworld, what I believe it will be (to some parts sooner, to others later,\r\nbut finally to all), the signal of arousing men to burst the chains\r\nunder which monkish ignorance and superstition had persuaded them\r\nto bind themselves, and to assume the blessings and security of\r\nself-government. That form which we have substituted, restores the free\r\nright to the unbounded exercise of reason and freedom of opinion. All\r\neyes are opened, or opening, to the rights of man. The general spread\r\nof the light of science has already laid open to every view the palpable\r\ntruth, that the mass of mankind has not been born with saddles on\r\ntheir backs, nor a favored few booted and spurred, ready to ride them\r\nlegitimately, by the grace of God. These are grounds of hope for others.\r\nFor ourselves, let the annual return of this day for ever refresh our\r\nrecollections of these rights, and an undiminished devotion to them.\r\n\r\nI will ask permission here to express the pleasure with which I\r\nshould have met my ancient neighbors of the city of Washington and\r\nits vicinities, with whom I passed so many years of a pleasing social\r\nintercourse; an intercourse which so much relieved the anxieties of the\r\npublic cares, and left impressions so deeply engraved in my affections,\r\nas never to be forgotten. With my regret that ill health forbids me the\r\ngratification of an acceptance, be pleased to receive for yourself,\r\nand those for whom you write, the assurance of my highest respect and\r\nfriendly attachments.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANA.--EXPLANATION OF THE THREE VOLUMES BOUND IN MARBLED PAPER\r\n\r\n\r\n_Explanation of the Three Volumes bound in Marbled Paper_.*\r\n\r\nIn these three volumes will be found copies of the official opinions\r\ngiven in writing by me to General Washington, while I was Secretary of\r\nState, with sometimes the documents belonging to the case. Some of\r\nthese are the rough draughts, some press copies, some fair ones. In the\r\nearlier part of my acting in that office, I took no other note of the\r\npassing transactions; but after a while, I saw the importance of doing\r\nit in aid of my memory. Very often, therefore, I made memorandums on\r\nloose scraps of paper, taken out of my pocket in the moment, and laid\r\nby to be copied fair at leisure, which, however, they hardly ever were.\r\nThese scraps, therefore, ragged, rubbed, and scribbled as they were, I\r\nhad bound with the others by a binder, who came into my cabinet, did it\r\nunder my own eye, and without the opportunity of reading a single paper.\r\nAt this day, after the lapse of twenty-five years, or more, from their\r\ndates, I have given to the whole a calm revisal, when the passions of\r\nthe time are passed away, and the reasons of the transactions act alone\r\non the judgment. Some of the informations I had recorded, are now cut\r\nout from the rest, because I have seen that they were incorrect, or\r\ndoubtful, or merely personal or private, with which we have nothing to\r\ndo. I should perhaps have thought the rest not worth preserving, but for\r\ntheir testimony against the only history of that period, which pretends\r\nto have been compiled from authentic and unpublished documents.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n[* These are the volumes containing the Ana to the time that the Author\r\nretired from the office of Secretary of State. The official opinions\r\nand documents referred to, being very voluminous, are for the most part\r\nomitted, to make room for the conversations which the same volumes\r\ncomprise.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut a short review of facts ***** will show, that the contests of that\r\nday were contests of principle between the advocates of republican,\r\nand those of kingly government, and that, had not the former made the\r\nefforts they did, our government would have been even at this early day,\r\na very different thing from what the successful issue of those efforts\r\nhave made it.\r\n\r\nThe alliance between the States under the old Articles of Confederation,\r\nfor the purpose of joint defence against the aggressions of Great\r\nBritain, was found insufficient, as treaties of alliance generally are,\r\nto enforce compliance with their mutual stipulations; and these, once\r\nfulfilled, that bond was to expire of itself, and each State to become\r\nsovereign and independent in all things. Yet, it could not but occur to\r\nevery one, that these separate independencies, like the petty States of\r\nGreece, would be eternally at war with each other, and would become\r\nat length the mere partisans and satellites of the leading powers of\r\nEurope. All, then, must have looked forward to some further bond of\r\nunion, which would insure internal peace, and a political system of our\r\nown, independent of that of Europe. Whether all should be consolidated\r\ninto a single government, or each remain independent as to internal\r\nmatters, and the whole form a single nation as to what was foreign only,\r\nand whether that national government should be a monarchy or republic,\r\nwould of course divide opinions, according to the constitutions, the\r\nhabits, and the circumstances of each individual. Some officers of the\r\narmy, as it has always been said and believed, (and Steuben and Knox\r\nhave ever been named as the leading agents,) trained to monarchy by\r\nmilitary habits, are understood to have proposed to General Washington,\r\nto decide this great question by the army before its disbandment, and\r\nto assume himself the crown, on the assurance of their support.\r\nThe indignity with which he is said to have scouted this parricide\r\nproposition, was equally worthy of his virtue and wisdom. The next\r\neffort was, (on suggestion of the same individuals, in the moment of\r\ntheir separation,) the establishment of an hereditary order, under\r\nthe name of the Cincinnati, ready prepared by that distinction to be\r\nengrafted into the future frame of government, and placing General\r\nWashington still at their head. The General wrote to me on this subject,\r\nwhile I was in Congress at Annapolis, and an extract from my letter is\r\ninserted in 5th Marshall’s History, page 28. He afterwards called on me\r\nat that place, on his way to a meeting of the society, and after a whole\r\nevening of consultation, he left that place fully determined to use\r\nall his endeavors for its total suppression. But he found it so firmly\r\nriveted in the affections of the members, that, strengthened as they\r\nhappened to be by an adventitious occurrence of the moment, he could\r\neffect no more than the abolition of its hereditary principle. He called\r\nagain on his return, and explained to me fully the opposition which had\r\nbeen made, the effect of the occurrence from France, and the difficulty\r\nwith which its duration had been limited to the lives of the present\r\nmembers. Further details will be found among my papers, in his and\r\nmy letters, and some in the _Encyclopédic Méthodique et Dictionnaire\r\nd’Economic Politique_, communicated by myself to M. Meusnier, its\r\nauthor, who had made the establishment of this society the ground, in\r\nthat work, of a libel on our country.\r\n\r\nThe want of some authority which should procure justice to the public\r\ncreditors, and an observance of treaties with foreign nations, produced,\r\nsome time after, the call of a convention of the States at Annapolis.\r\nAlthough, at this meeting, a difference of opinion was evident on the\r\nquestion of a republican or kingly government, yet, so general through\r\nthe States was the sentiment in favor of the former, that the friends\r\nof the latter confined themselves to a course of obstruction only, and\r\ndelay, to every thing proposed; they hoped, that nothing being done,\r\nand all things going from bad to worse, a kingly government might be\r\nusurped, and submitted to by the people, as better than anarchy and\r\nwars, internal and external, the certain consequences of the present\r\nwant of a general government. The effect of their manoeuvres, with\r\nthe defective attendance of Deputies from the States, resulted in\r\nthe measure of calling a more general convention, to be held at\r\nPhiladelphia. At this the same party exhibited the same practices, and\r\nwith the same views of preventing a government of concord, which they\r\nforesaw would be republican, and of forcing: through anarchy their way\r\nto monarchy. But the mass of that convention was too honest, too wise,\r\nand too steady, to be baffled and misled by their manoeuvres. One of\r\nthese was a form of government proposed by Colonel Hamilton, which would\r\nhave been in fact a compromise between the two parties of royalism and\r\nrepublicanism. According to this, the executive and one branch of the\r\nlegislature were to be during good behavior, i.e. for life, and the\r\ngovernors of the States were to be named by these two permanent organs.\r\nThis, however, was rejected; on which Hamilton left the convention, as\r\ndesperate, and never returned again until near its final conclusion.\r\nThese opinions and efforts, secret or avowed, of the advocates for\r\nmonarchy, had begotten great jealousy through the States generally;\r\nand this jealousy it was, which excited the strong opposition to the\r\nconventional constitution; a jealousy which yielded at last only to\r\na general determination to establish certain amendments, as barriers\r\nagainst a government either monarchical or consolidated. In what passed\r\nthrough the whole period of these conventions, I have gone on the\r\ninformation of those who were members of them, being absent myself on my\r\nmission to France.\r\n\r\nI returned from that mission in the first year of the new government,\r\nhaving landed in Virginia in December, 1789, and proceeded to New York\r\nin March, 1790, to enter on the office of Secretary of State.\r\nHere, certainly, I found a state of things which, of all I had ever\r\ncontemplated, I the least expected. I had left France in the first\r\nyear of her revolution, in the fervor of natural rights, and zeal for\r\nreformation. My conscientious devotion to these rights could not be\r\nheightened, but it had been aroused and excited by daily exercise. The\r\nPresident received me cordially, and my colleagues and the circle\r\nof principal citizens, apparently with welcome. The courtesies of\r\ndinner-parties given me, as a stranger newly arrived among them, placed\r\nme at once in their familiar society. But I cannot describe the wonder\r\nand mortification with which the table conversations filled me. Politics\r\nwere the chief topic, and a preference of kingly over republican\r\ngovernment, was evidently the favorite sentiment. An apostate I could\r\nnot be, nor yet a hypocrite; and I found myself, for the most part, the\r\nonly advocate on the republican side of the question, unless among\r\nthe guests there chanced to be some member of that party from the\r\nlegislative Houses. Hamilton’s financial system had then passed. It\r\nhad two objects; 1. as a puzzle, to exclude popular understanding and\r\ninquiry; 2. as a machine for the corruption of the legislature: for he\r\navowed the opinion, that man could be governed by one of two motives\r\nonly, force or interest: force, he observed, in this country, was out of\r\nthe question, and the interests, therefore, of the members must be laid\r\nhold of, to keep the legislature in unison with the executive. And with\r\ngrief and shame it must be acknowledged that his machine was not without\r\neffect; that even in this, the birth of our government, some members\r\nwere found sordid enough to bend their duty, to their interests, and to\r\nlook after personal rather than public good.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that during the war, the greatest difficulty we\r\nencountered, was the want of money or means to pay our soldiers who\r\nfought, or our farmers, manufacturers, and merchants, who furnished the\r\nnecessary supplies of food and clothing for them. After the expedient of\r\npaper money had exhausted itself, certificates of debt were given to the\r\nindividual creditors, with assurance of payment, so soon as the United\r\nStates should be able. But the distresses of these people often obliged\r\nthem to part with these for the half, the fifth, and even a tenth of\r\ntheir value; and speculators had made a trade of cozening them from the\r\nholders, by the most fraudulent practices, and persuasions that they\r\nwould never be paid. In the bill for funding and paying these, Hamilton\r\nmade no difference between the original holders, and the fraudulent\r\npurchasers of this paper. Great and just repugnance arose at putting\r\nthese two classes of creditors on the same footing, and great exertions\r\nwere used to pay the former the full value, and to the latter, the price\r\nonly which they had paid, with interest. But this would have prevented\r\nthe game which was to be played, and for which the minds of greedy\r\nmembers were already tutored and prepared. When the trial of strength,\r\non these several efforts, had indicated the form in which the bill would\r\nfinally pass, this being known within doors sooner than without, and\r\nespecially, than to those who were in distant parts of the Union,\r\nthe base scramble began. Couriers and relay-horses by land, and\r\nswift-sailing pilot-boats by sea, were flying in all directions. Active\r\npartners and agents were associated and employed in every State,\r\ntown, and country neighborhood, and this paper was bought up at five\r\nshillings, and even as low as two shillings in the pound, before the\r\nholder knew that Congress had already provided for its redemption at\r\npar. Immense sums were thus filched from the poor and ignorant, and\r\nfortunes accumulated by those who had themselves been poor enough\r\nbefore. Men thus enriched by the dexterity of a leader, would follow of\r\ncourse the chief who was leading them to fortune, and become the zealous\r\ninstruments of all his enterprises.\r\n\r\nThis game was over, and another was on the carpet at the moment of my\r\narrival; and to this I was most ignorantly and innocently made to hold\r\nthe candle. This fiscal manoeuvre is well known by the name of the\r\nAssumption. Independently of the debts of Congress, the States had,\r\nduring the war, contracted separate and heavy debts; and Massachusetts\r\nparticularly, in an absurd attempt, absurdly conducted, on the British\r\npost of Penobscot: and the more debt Hamilton could rake up, the more\r\nplunder for his mercenaries. This money, whether wisely or foolishly\r\nspent, was pretended to have been spent for general purposes, and ought,\r\ntherefore, to be paid from the general purse. But it was objected, that\r\nnobody knew what these debts were, what their amount, or what their\r\nproofs. No matter; we will guess them to be twenty millions. But of\r\nthese twenty millions, we do not know how much should be reimbursed\r\nto one State, or how much to another. No matter; we will guess. And so\r\nanother scramble was set on foot among the several States, and some got\r\nmuch, some little, some nothing. But the main object was obtained, the\r\nphalanx of the Treasury was reinforced by additional recruits. This\r\nmeasure produced the most bitter and angry contests ever known in\r\nCongress, before or since the Union of the States. I arrived in the\r\nmidst of it. But a stranger to the ground, a stranger to the actors on\r\nit, so long absent as to have lost all familiarity with the subject,\r\nand as yet unaware of its object, I took no concern in it. The great and\r\ntrying question, however, was lost in the House of Representatives.\r\nSo high were the feuds excited by this subject, that on its rejection\r\nbusiness was suspended. Congress met and adjourned from day to day\r\nwithout doing any thing, the parties being too much out of temper to\r\ndo business together. The eastern members particularly, who, with\r\nSmith from South Carolina, were the principal gamblers in these scenes,\r\nthreatened a secession and dissolution. Hamilton was in despair. As I\r\nwas going to the President’s one day, I met him in the street. He walked\r\nme backwards and forwards before the President’s door for half an hour.\r\nHe painted pathetically the temper into which the legislature had been\r\nwrought; the disgust of those who were called the creditor States; the\r\ndanger of the secession of their members, and the separation of the\r\nStates. He observed that the members of the administration ought to act\r\nin concert; that though this question was not of my department, yet a\r\ncommon duty should make it a common concern; that the President was the\r\ncentre on which all administrative questions ultimately rested, and\r\nthat all of us should rally around him, and support, with joint efforts,\r\nmeasures approved by him; and that the question having been lost by\r\na small majority only, it was probable that an appeal from me to the\r\njudgment and discretion of some of my friends, might effect a change in\r\nthe vote, and the machine of government, now suspended, might be again\r\nset into motion. I told him that I was really a stranger to the whole\r\nsubject; that not having yet informed myself of the system of finance\r\nadopted, I knew not how far this was a necessary sequence; that\r\nundoubtedly, if its rejection endangered a dissolution of our Union at\r\nthis incipient stage, I should deem that the most unfortunate of all\r\nconsequences, to avert which all partial and temporary evils should be\r\nyielded. I proposed to him, however, to dine with me the next day, and I\r\nwould invite another friend or two, bring them into conference together,\r\nand I thought it impossible that reasonable men, consulting together\r\ncoolly, could fail, by some mutual sacrifices of opinion, to form a\r\ncompromise which was to save the Union. The discussion took place.\r\nI could take no part in it but an exhortatory one, because I was a\r\nstranger to the circumstances which should govern it. But it was finally\r\nagreed, that whatever importance had been attached to the rejection of\r\nthis proposition, the preservation of the Union and of concord among the\r\nStates was more important, and that therefore it would be better that\r\nthe vote of rejection should be rescinded, to effect which, some members\r\nshould change their votes. But it was observed that this pill would\r\nbe peculiarly bitter to the Southern States, and that some concomitant\r\nmeasure should be adopted to sweeten it a little to them. There had\r\nbefore been propositions to fix the seat of government either at\r\nPhiladelphia, or at Georgetown on the Potomac; and it was thought\r\nthat by giving it to Philadelphia for ten years, and to Georgetown\r\npermanently afterwards, this might, as an anodyne, calm in some degree\r\nthe ferment which might be excited by the other measure alone. So two\r\nof the Potomac members (White and Lee, but White with a revulsion of\r\nstomach almost convulsive,) agreed to change their votes, and Hamilton\r\nundertook to carry the other point. In doing this, the influence he had\r\nestablished over the eastern members, with the agency of Robert Morris\r\nwith those of the middle States, effected his side of the engagement;\r\nand so the Assumption was passed, and twenty millions of stock divided\r\namong favored States, and thrown in as a pabulum to the stock-jobbing\r\nherd. This added to the number of votaries to the Treasury, and made its\r\nchief the master of every vote in the legislature, which might give to\r\nthe government the direction suited to his political views.\r\n\r\nI know well, and so must be understood, that nothing like a majority in\r\nCongress had yielded to this corruption. Far from it. But a division,\r\nnot very unequal, had already taken place in the honest part of that\r\nbody, between the parties styled republican and federal. The latter\r\nbeing monarchists in principle, adhered to Hamilton of course, as their\r\nleader in that principle, and this mercenary phalanx added to them,\r\ninsured him always a majority in both Houses: so that the whole action\r\nof the legislature was now under the direction of the Treasury. Still\r\nthe machine was not complete. The effect of the funding system, and of\r\nthe Assumption, would be temporary; it would be lost with the loss\r\nof the individual members whom it had enriched, and some engine of\r\ninfluence more permanent must be contrived, while these myrmidons were\r\nyet in place to carry it through all opposition. This engine was the\r\nBank of the United States. All that history is known, so I shall say\r\nnothing about it. While the government remained at Philadelphia, a\r\nselection of members of both Houses were constantly kept as directors,\r\nwho, on every question interesting to that institution, or to the views\r\nof the federal head, voted at the will of that head; and, together with\r\nthe stock-holding members, could always make the federal vote that of\r\nthe majority. By this combination, legislative expositions were given\r\nto the constitution, and all the administrative laws were shaped on\r\nthe model of England and so passed. And from this influence we were\r\nnot relieved, until the removal from the precincts of the bank, to\r\nWashington. Here then was the real ground of the opposition which was\r\nmade to the course of administration. Its object was to preserve the\r\nlegislature pure and independent of the executive, to restrain, the\r\nadministration to republican forms and principles, and not permit the\r\nconstitution to be construed into a monarchy, and to be warped, in\r\npractice, into all the principles and pollutions of their favorite\r\nEnglish model. Nor was this an opposition to General Washington. He\r\nwas true to the republican charge confided to him; and has solemnly and\r\nrepeatedly protested to me, in our conversations, that he would lose the\r\nlast drop of his blood in support of it; and he did this the oftener and\r\nwith the more earnestness, because he knew my suspicions of Hamilton’s\r\ndesigns against it, and wished to quiet them. For he was not aware of\r\nthe drift, or of the effect of Hamilton’s schemes. Unversed in financial\r\nprojects and calculations and budgets, his approbation of them was\r\nbottomed on his confidence in the man.\r\n\r\nBut Hamilton was not only a monarchist, but for a monarchy bottomed on\r\ncorruption. In proof of this, I will relate an anecdote, for the truth\r\nof which I attest the God who made me. Before the President set out on\r\nhis southern tour in April, 1791, he addressed a letter of the fourth\r\nof that month, from Mount Vernon, to the Secretaries of State, Treasury,\r\nand War, desiring that if any serious and important cases should arise\r\nduring his absence, they would consult and act on them. And he requested\r\nthat the Vice-President should also be consulted. This was the only\r\noccasion on which that officer was ever requested to take part in a\r\ncabinet question. Some occasion for consultation arising, I invited\r\nthose gentlemen (and the Attorney General, as well as I remember,) to\r\ndine with me, in order to confer on the subject. After the cloth was\r\nremoved, and our question agreed and dismissed, conversation began\r\non other matters, and, by some circumstance, was led to the British\r\nconstitution, on which Mr. Adams observed, ‘Purge that constitution\r\nof its corruption, and give to its popular branch equality of\r\nrepresentation, and it would be the most perfect constitution ever\r\ndevised by the wit of man.’ Hamilton paused and said, ‘Purge it of its\r\ncorruption, and give to its popular branch equality of representation,\r\nand it would become an impracticable government: as it stands at\r\npresent, with all its supposed defects, it is the most perfect\r\ngovernment which ever existed.’ And this was assuredly the exact line\r\nwhich separated the political creeds of these two gentlemen. The one was\r\nfor two hereditary branches and an honest elective one: the other, for\r\nan hereditary King, with a House of Lords and Commons corrupted to his\r\nwill, and standing between him and the people. Hamilton was, indeed, a\r\nsingular character. Of acute understanding, disinterested, honest, and\r\nhonorable in all private transactions, amiable in society, and duly\r\nvaluing virtue in private life, yet so bewitched and perverted by the\r\nBritish example, as to be under thorough conviction that corruption was\r\nessential to the government of a nation. Mr. Adams had originally been\r\na republican. The glare of royalty and nobility, during his mission to\r\nEngland, had made him believe their fascination a necessary ingredient\r\nin government; and Shays’s rebellion, not sufficiently understood where\r\nhe then was, seemed to prove that the absence of want and oppression,\r\nwas not a sufficient guarantee of order. His book on the American\r\nConstitutions having made known his political bias, he was taken up by\r\nthe monarchical federalists in his absence, and, on his return to\r\nthe United States, he was by them made to believe that the general\r\ndisposition of our citizens was favorable to monarchy. He here wrote\r\nhis Davila, as a supplement to the former work, and his election to\r\nthe Presidency confirmed him in his errors. Innumerable addresses too,\r\nartfully and industriously poured in upon him, deceived him into a\r\nconfidence that he was on the pinnacle of popularity, when the gulph was\r\nyawning at his feet, which was to swallow up him and his deceivers. For\r\nwhen General Washington was withdrawn, these _energumeni_ of royalism,\r\nkept in check hitherto by the dread of his honesty, his firmness, his\r\npatriotism, and the authority of his name, now mounted on the car of\r\nState and free from control, like Phaeton on that of the sun, drove\r\nheadlong and wild, looking neither to right nor left, nor regarding\r\nany thing but the objects they were driving at; until, displaying these\r\nfully, the eyes of the nation were opened, and a general disbandment of\r\nthem from the public councils took place.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams, I am sure, has been long since convinced of the treacheries\r\nwith which he was surrounded during his administration. He has since\r\nthoroughly seen, that his constituents were devoted to republican\r\ngovernment, and whether his judgment is resettled on its ancient basis,\r\nor not, he is conformed as a good citizen to the will of the majority,\r\nand would now, I am persuaded, maintain its republican structure with\r\nthe zeal and fidelity belonging to his character. For even an enemy has\r\nsaid, ‘He is always an honest man, and often a great one.’ But in\r\nthe fervor of the fury and follies of those who made him their\r\nstalking-horse, no man who did not witness it can form an idea of\r\ntheir unbridled madness, and the terrorism with which they surrounded\r\nthemselves. The horrors of the French revolution, then raging, aided\r\nthem mainly, and using that as a raw-head and bloody-bones, they were\r\nenabled by their stratagems of X. Y. Z. in which ------ was a leading\r\nmountebank, their tales of tub-plots, ocean-massacres, bloody-buoys, and\r\npulpit-lyings and slanderings, and maniacal ravings of their Gardiners,\r\ntheir Osgoods, and Parishes, to spread alarm into all but the firmest\r\nbreasts. Their Attorney General had the impudence to say to a republican\r\nmember, that deportation must be resorted to, of which, said he, ‘you\r\nrepublicans have set the example’; thus daring to identify us with the\r\nmurderous Jacobins of France. These transactions, now recollected but\r\nas dreams of the night, were then sad realities; and nothing rescued us\r\nfrom their liberticide effect, but the unyielding opposition of those\r\nfirm spirits who sternly maintained their post in defiance of terror,\r\nuntil their fellow-citizens could be aroused to their own danger, and\r\nrally and rescue the standard of the constitution. This has been happily\r\ndone. Federalism and monarchism have languished from that moment, until\r\ntheir treasonable combinations with the enemies of their country during\r\nthe late war, their plots of dismembering the Union, and their Hartford\r\nConvention, have consigned them to the tomb of the dead: and I fondly\r\nhope, ‘we may now truly say, We are all republicans, all federalists,’\r\nand that the motto of the standard to which our country will for ever\r\nrally, will be, ‘Federal union, and republican government’: and sure I\r\nam we may say, that we are indebted for the preservation of this point\r\nof ralliance, to that opposition of which so injurious an idea is so\r\nartfully insinuated and excited in this history.\r\n\r\nMuch of this relation is notorious to the world; and many intimate\r\nproofs of it will be found in these notes. From the moment where they\r\nend, of my retiring from the administration, the federalists * got\r\nunchecked hold of General Washington. His memory was already sensibly\r\nimpaired by age, the firm tone of mind for which he had been remarkable,\r\nwas beginning to relax, its energy was abated, a listlessness of labor,\r\na desire for tranquillity had crept on him, and a willingness to let\r\nothers act, and even think for him. Like the rest of mankind, he\r\nwas disgusted with atrocities of the French revolution, and was not\r\nsufficiently aware of the difference between the rabble who were used as\r\ninstruments of their perpetration, and the steady and rational character\r\nof the American people, in which he had not sufficient confidence. The\r\nopposition too of the republicans to the British treaty, and the zealous\r\nsupport of the federalists in that unpopular but favorite measure of\r\ntheirs, had made him all their own. Understanding, moreover, that I\r\ndisapproved of that treaty, and copiously nourished with falsehoods by\r\na malignant neighbor of mine, who ambitioned to be his correspondent, he\r\nhad become alienated from myself personally, as from the republican body\r\ngenerally of his fellow-citizens; and he wrote the letters to Mr. Adams\r\nand Mr. Carroll, over which, in devotion to his imperishable fame, we\r\nmust for ever weep as monuments of mortal decay.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson. February 4th, 1818.\r\n\r\n* See conversation with General Washington, of October 1,1792,\r\n\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust the 13th, 1791. Notes of a conversation between Alexander\r\nHamilton and Thomas Jefferson. Th: Jefferson mentioned to him a letter\r\nreceived from John Adams, disavowing Publicola, and denying that he ever\r\nentertained a wish to bring this country under an hereditary executive,\r\nor introduce an hereditary branch of legislature, &c. See his\r\nletter. Alexander Hamilton condemning Mr. Adams’s writings, and\r\nmost particularly Davila, as having a tendency to weaken the present\r\ngovernment, declared in substance as follows: ‘I own it is my own\r\nopinion, though I do not publish it in Dan or Beersheba, that the\r\npresent government is not that which will answer the ends of society, by\r\ngiving stability and protection to its rights, and that it will probably\r\nbe found expedient to go into the British form. However, since we have\r\nundertaken the experiment, I am for giving it a fair course, whatever my\r\nexpectations may be. The success, indeed, so far, is greater than I had\r\nexpected, and therefore, at present, success seems more possible than\r\nit had done heretofore, and there are still other and other stages of\r\nimprovement, which, if the present does not succeed, may be tried, and\r\nought to be tried, before we give up the republican form altogether; for\r\nthat mind must be really depraved, which would not prefer the equality\r\nof political rights, which is the foundation of pure republicanism, if\r\nit can be obtained consistently with order. Therefore, whoever by his\r\nwritings disturbs the present order of things, is really blameable,\r\nhowever pure his intentions may be, and he was sure Mr. Adams’s were\r\npure.’ This is the substance of a declaration made in much more lengthy\r\nterms, and which seemed to be more formal than usual for a private\r\nconversation between two, and as if intended to qualify some less\r\nguarded expressions which had been dropped on former occasions. Th:\r\nJefferson has committed it to writing in the moment of A. Hamilton’s\r\nleaving the room.\r\n\r\nDecember the 25th, 1791. Colonel Gunn (of Georgia), dining the other day\r\nwith Colonel Hamilton, said to him, with that plain freedom he is known\r\nto use, ‘I wish, Sir, you would advise your friend King to observe some\r\nkind of consistency in his votes. There has been scarcely a question\r\nbefore the Senate on which he has not voted both ways. On the\r\nrepresentation bill, for instance, he first voted for the proposition\r\nof the Representatives, and ultimately voted against it.’ ‘Why,’ says\r\nColonel Hamilton, ‘I ‘ll tell you as to that, Colonel Gunn, that it\r\nnever was intended that bill should pass.’ Gunn told this to Butler, who\r\ntold it to Th: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\nCONVERSATIONS WITH THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nFebruary the 28th, 1792. I was to have been with him long enough before\r\nthree o’clock (which was the hour and day he received visits) to\r\nhave opened to him a proposition for doubling the velocity of the\r\npost-riders, who now travel about fifty miles a day, and might, without\r\ndifficulty, go one hundred, and for taking measures (by way-bills) to\r\nknow where the delay is, when there is any. I was delayed by business,\r\nso as to have scarcely time to give him the outlines. I run over them\r\nrapidly, and observed afterwards, that I had hitherto never spoken\r\nto him on the subject of the post-office, not knowing whether it was\r\nconsidered as a revenue law, or a law for the general accommodation of\r\nthe citizens: that the law just passed seemed to have removed the doubt,\r\nby declaring that the whole profits of the office should be applied to\r\nextending the posts, and that even the past profits should be refunded\r\nby the Treasury for the same purpose: that I therefore conceived it was\r\nnow in the department of the Secretary of State: that I thought it would\r\nbe advantageous so to declare it for another reason, to wit, that the\r\ndepartment of the Treasury possessed already such an influence as\r\nto swallow up the whole executive powers, and that even the future\r\nPresidents (not supported by the weight of character which himself\r\npossessed) would not be able to make head against this department. That\r\nin urging this measure I had certainly no personal interest, since, if\r\nI was supposed to have any appetite for power, yet, as my career would\r\ncertainly be exactly as short as his own, the intervening time was too\r\nshort to be an object. My real wish was to avail the public of every\r\noccasion, during the residue of the President’s period, to place things\r\non a safe footing. He was now called on to attend his company, and he\r\ndesired me to come and breakfast with him the next morning.\r\n\r\nFebruary the 29th. I did so; and after breakfast we retired to his\r\nroom, and I unfolded my plan for the post-office, and after such\r\nan approbation of it as he usually permitted himself on the first\r\npresentment of any idea, and desiring me to commit it to writing, he,\r\nduring that pause of conversation which follows a business closed, said,\r\nin an affectionate tone, that he had felt much concern at an expression\r\nwhich dropped from me yesterday, and which marked my intention of\r\nretiring when he should. That as to himself, many motives obliged him to\r\nit. He had, through the whole course of the war, and most particularly\r\nat the close of it, uniformly declared his resolution to retire from\r\npublic affairs, and never to act in any public office; that he had\r\nretired under that firm resolution: that the government however, which\r\nhad been formed, being found evidently too inefficacious, and it being\r\nsupposed that his aid was of some consequence towards bringing the\r\npeople to consent to one of sufficient efficacy for their own good, he\r\nconsented to come into the convention, and on the same motive, after\r\nmuch pressing, to take a part in the new government, and get it under\r\nway. That were he to continue longer, it might give room to say, that\r\nhaving tasted the sweets of office, he could not do without them: that\r\nhe really felt himself growing old, his bodily health less firm, his\r\nmemory, always bad, becoming worse, and perhaps the other faculties of\r\nhis mind showing a decay to others of which he was insensible himself;\r\nthat this apprehension particularly oppressed him: that he found,\r\nmoreover, his activity lessened, business therefore more irksome,\r\nand tranquillity and retirement become an irresistible passion. That,\r\nhowever he felt himself obliged, for these reasons, to retire from the\r\ngovernment, yet he should consider it as unfortunate, if that should\r\nbring on the retirement of the great officers of the government,\r\nand that this might produce a shock on the public mind of dangerous\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\nI told him that no man had ever had less desire of entering into public\r\noffices than myself; that the circumstance of a perilous war, which\r\nbrought every thing into danger, and called for all the services\r\nwhich every citizen could render, had induced me to undertake the\r\nadministration of the government of Virginia; that I had both before\r\nand after refused repeated appointments of Congress to go abroad in that\r\nsort of office, which, if I had consulted my own gratification, would\r\nalways have been the most agreeable to me; that at the end of two\r\nyears, I resigned the government of Virginia, and retired with a firm\r\nresolution never more to appear in public life; that a domestic loss,\r\nhowever, happened, and made me fancy that absence and a change of\r\nscene for a time might be expedient for me; that I therefore accepted\r\na foreign appointment, limited to two years; that at the close of that,\r\nDoctor Franklin having left France, I was appointed to supply his place,\r\nwhich I had accepted, and though I continued in it three or four years,\r\nit was under the constant idea of remaining only a year or two longer;\r\nthat the revolution in France coming on, I had so interested myself\r\nin the event of that, that when obliged to bring my family home, I had\r\nstill an idea of returning and awaiting the close of that, to fix the\r\nera of my final retirement; that on my arrival here I found he had\r\nappointed me to my present office; that he knew I had not come into\r\nit without some reluctance; that it was, on my part, a sacrifice of\r\ninclination to the opinion that I might be more serviceable here than\r\nin France, and with a firm resolution in my mind, to indulge my constant\r\nwish for retirement at no very distant day; that when, therefore, I had\r\nreceived his letter, written from Mount Vernon, on his way to Carolina\r\nand Georgia (April the 1st, 1791), and discovered, from an expression\r\nin that, that he meant to retire from the government ere long, and as to\r\nthe precise epoch there could be no doubt, my mind was immediately made\r\nup, to make that the epoch of my own retirement from those labors of\r\nwhich I was heartily tired. That, however, I did not believe there was\r\nany idea in either of my brethren in the administration of retiring;\r\nthat on the contrary, I had perceived at a late meeting of the trustees\r\nof the sinking fund, that the Secretary of the Treasury had developed\r\nthe plan he intended to pursue, and that it embraced years in its view.\r\n\r\nHe said, that he considered the Treasury department as a much more\r\nlimited one, going only to the single object of revenue, while that\r\nof the Secretary of State, embracing nearly all the objects of\r\nadministration, was much more important, and the retirement of the\r\nofficer therefore, would be more noticed: that though the government had\r\nset out with a pretty general good will of the public, yet that symptoms\r\nof dissatisfaction had lately shown themselves far beyond what he could\r\nhave expected, and to what height these might arise, in case of too\r\ngreat a change in the administration, could not be foreseen.\r\n\r\nI told him that in my opinion, there was only a single source of these\r\ndiscontents. Though they had indeed appeared to spread themselves over\r\nthe War department also, yet I considered that as an overflowing only\r\nfrom their real channel, which would never have taken place, if they\r\nhad not first been generated in another department, to wit, that of\r\nthe Treasury. That a system had there been contrived, for deluging the\r\nStates with paper-money instead of gold and silver, for withdrawing our\r\ncitizens from the pursuits of commerce, manufactures, buildings, and\r\nother branches of useful industry, to occupy themselves and their\r\ncapitals in a species of gambling, destructive of morality, and which\r\nhad introduced its poison into the government itself. That it was a\r\nfact, as certainly known as that he and I were then conversing, that\r\nparticular members of the legislature, while those laws were on the\r\ncarpet, had feathered their nests with paper, had then voted for the\r\nlaws, and constantly since lent all the energy of their talents, and\r\ninstrumentality of their offices, to the establishment and enlargement\r\nof this system; that they had chained it about our necks for a great\r\nlength of time, and in order to keep the game in their hands, had, from\r\ntime to time, aided in making such legislative constructions of the\r\nconstitution, as made it a very different thing from what the people\r\nthought they had submitted to; that they had now brought forward a\r\nproposition far beyond every one ever yet advanced, and to which the\r\neyes of many were turned, as the decision which was to let us know,\r\nwhether we live under a limited or an unlimited government. He asked\r\nme to what proposition I alluded; I answered, to that in the report\r\non manufactures, which, under color of giving bounties for the\r\nencouragement of particular manufactures, meant to establish the\r\ndoctrine, that the power given by the constitution to collect taxes to\r\nprovide for the general welfare of the United States, permitted Congress\r\nto take every thing under their management which they should deem for\r\nthe public welfare, and which is susceptible of the application of\r\nmoney; consequently, that the subsequent enumeration of their powers\r\nwas not the description to which resort must be had, and did not at all\r\nconstitute the limits of their authority: that this was a very different\r\nquestion from that of the bank, which was thought an incident to an\r\nenumerated power: that, therefore, this decision was expected with\r\ngreat anxiety; that, indeed, I hoped the proposition would be rejected,\r\nbelieving there was a majority in both Houses against it, and that if it\r\nshould be, it would be considered as a proof that things were returning\r\ninto their true channel: and that, at any rate, I looked forward to the\r\nbroad representation which would shortly take place, for keeping the\r\ngeneral constitution on its true ground; and that this would remove a\r\ngreat deal of the discontent which had shown itself. The conversation\r\nended with this last topic. It is here stated nearly as much at length\r\nas it really was; the expressions preserved where I could recollect\r\nthem, and their substance always faithfully stated.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\nMarch 1, 1792.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of January, 1792, Messrs. Fitzsimmons and Gerry (among\r\nothers) dined with me. These two staid, with a Mr. Learned of\r\nConnecticut, after the company was gone. We got on the subject of\r\nreferences by the legislature to the Heads of departments, considering\r\ntheir mischief in every direction. Gerry and Fitzsimmons clearly opposed\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nTwo days afterwards (January the 4th), Mr. Bourne from Rhode Island\r\npresented a memorial from his State, complaining of inequality in the\r\nAssumption, and moved to refer it to the Secretary of the Treasury.\r\nFitzsimmons, Gerry, and others opposed it; but it was carried.\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary the 19th. Fitzsimmons moved, that the President of the United\r\nStates be requested to direct the Secretary of the Treasury, to lay\r\nbefore the House information to enable the legislature to judge of\r\nthe additional revenue necessary on the increase of the military\r\nestablishment. The House, on debate, struck out the words, ‘President of\r\nthe United States.’\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch the 7th. The subject resumed. An animated debate took place on the\r\ntendency of references to the Heads of departments; and it seemed that\r\na great majority would be against it: the House adjourned. Treasury\r\ngreatly alarmed, and much industry supposed to be used before next\r\nmorning, when it was brought on again, and debated through the day, and\r\non the question, the Treasury carried it by thirty-one to twenty-seven:\r\nbut deeply wounded, since it was seen that all Pennsylvania, except\r\nJacobs, voted against the reference; that Tucker of South Carolina voted\r\nfor it, and Sumpter absented himself, debauched for the moment only,\r\nbecause of the connection of the question with a further assumption\r\nwhich South Carolina favored; but showing that they never were to be\r\ncounted on among the Treasury votes.\r\n\r\nSome others absented themselves. Gerry changed sides. On the whole, it\r\nshowed that Treasury influence was tottering. Committed to writing this\r\n10th of March, 1792.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch the 11th, 1792. Consulted verbally by the President, on whom a\r\ncommittee of the Senate (Izard, Morris, and King) are to wait to-morrow\r\nmorning, to know whether he will think it proper to redeem our Algerine\r\ncaptives, and make a treaty with the Algerines, on the single vote of\r\nthe Senate, without taking that of the Representatives.\r\n\r\nMy opinions run on the following heads.\r\n\r\nWe must go to Algiers with cash in our hands. Where shall we get it? By\r\nloan? By converting money now in the treasury?\r\n\r\nProbably a loan might be obtained on the President’s authority: but as\r\nthis could not be repaid without a subsequent act of legislature,\r\nthe Representatives might refuse it. So if money in the treasury be\r\nconverted, they may refuse to sanction it.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent approbation of the Senate being necessary to validate a\r\ntreaty, they expect to be consulted beforehand, if the case admits.\r\n\r\nSo the subsequent act of the Representatives being necessary where money\r\nis given, why should not they expect to be consulted in like manner,\r\nwhen the case admits? A treaty is a law of the land. But prudence will\r\npoint out this difference to be attended to in making them; viz. where\r\na treaty contains such articles only as will go into execution of\r\nthemselves, or be carried into execution by the judges, they may be\r\nsafely made; but where there are articles which require a law to be\r\npassed afterwards by the legislature, great caution is requisite.\r\n\r\nFor example; the consular convention with France required a very small\r\nlegislative regulation. This convention was unanimously ratified by the\r\nSenate. Yet the same identical men threw by the law to enforce it at\r\nthe last session, and the Representatives at this session have placed it\r\namong the laws which they may take up or not, at their own convenience,\r\nas if that was a higher motive than the public faith.\r\n\r\nTherefore, against hazarding this transaction without the sanction of\r\nboth Houses.\r\n\r\nThe President concurred. The Senate express the motive for this\r\nproposition, to be a fear that the Representatives would not keep the\r\nsecret. He has no opinion of the secrecy of the Senate. In this very\r\ncase, Mr. Izard made the communication to him, sitting next to him at\r\ntable, on one hand, while a lady (Mrs. McLane) was on his other hand,\r\nand the French minister next to her; and as Mr. Izard got on with his\r\ncommunication, his voice kept rising, and his stutter bolting the words\r\nout loudly at intervals, so that the minister might hear if he would. He\r\nsaid he had a great mind at one time to have got up, in order to put a\r\nstop to Mr. Izard.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch the 11th, 1792. Mr. Sterret tells me that sitting round a fire the\r\nother day with four or five others, Mr. Smith (of South Carolina) was\r\none. Somebody mentioned that the murderers of Hogeboom, sheriff of\r\nColumbia county, New York, were acquitted. ‘Ay,’ says Smith, ‘this is\r\nwhat comes of your damned trial by jury.’\r\n\r\n\r\n1791. Towards the latter end of November, Hamilton had drawn Ternant\r\ninto a conversation on the subject of the treaty of commerce recommended\r\nby the National Assembly of France to be negotiated with us, and, as\r\nhe had no ready instructions on the subject, he led him into a proposal\r\nthat Ternant should take the thing up as a volunteer with me, that we\r\nshould arrange conditions, and let them go for confirmation or refusal.\r\nHamilton communicated this to the President, who came into it, and\r\nproposed it to me. I disapproved of it, observing, that such a volunteer\r\nproject would be binding on us, and not them; that it would enable them\r\nto find out how far we would go, and avail themselves of it. However,\r\nthe President thought it worth trying, and I acquiesced. I prepared a\r\nplan of treaty for exchanging the privileges of native subjects, and\r\nfixing all duties for ever as they now stood. Hamilton did not like this\r\nway of fixing the duties, because, he said, many articles here would\r\nbear to be raised, and therefore, he would prepare a tariff. He did so,\r\nraising duties for the French, from twenty-five to fifty per cent. So\r\nthey were to give us the privileges of native subjects, and we, as a\r\ncompensation, were to make them pay higher duties. Hamilton, having made\r\nhis arrangements with Hammond to pretend that though he had no powers to\r\nconclude a treaty of commerce, yet his general commission authorized him\r\nto enter into the discussion of one, then proposed to the President at\r\none of our meetings, that the business should be taken up with Hammond\r\nin the same informal way. I now discovered the trap which he had laid,\r\nby first getting the President into the step with Ternant. I opposed\r\nthe thing warmly. Hamilton observed, if we did it with Ternant we should\r\nalso with Hammond. The President thought this reasonable. I desired him\r\nto recollect, I had been against it with Ternant, and only acquiesced\r\nunder his opinion. So the matter went off as to both. His scheme\r\nevidently was, to get us engaged first with Ternant, merely that he\r\nmight have a pretext to engage us on the same ground with Hammond,\r\ntaking care, at the same time, by an extravagant tariff, to render\r\nit impossible we should come to any conclusion with Ternant: probably\r\nmeaning, at the same time, to propose terms so favorable to Great\r\nBritain, as would attach us to that country by treaty. On one of those\r\noccasions he asserted, that our commerce with Great Britain and her\r\ncolonies was put on a much more favorable footing than with France and\r\nher colonies. I therefore prepared the tabular comparative view of the\r\nfooting-of our commerce with those nations, which see among my papers.\r\nSee also my project of a treaty and Hamilton’s tariff. Committed to\r\nwriting March the 11th, 1792.\r\n\r\nIt was observable, that whenever, at any of our consultations, any\r\nthing was proposed as to Great Britain, Hamilton had constantly ready\r\nsomething which Mr. Hammond had communicated to him, which suited the\r\nsubject and proved the intimacy of their communications; insomuch, that\r\nI believe he communicated to Hammond all our views, and knew from\r\nhim, in return, the views of the British court. Many evidences of this\r\noccurred; I will state some. I delivered to the President my report of\r\ninstructions for Carmichael and Short, on the subject of navigation,\r\nboundary, and commerce, and desired him to submit it to Hamilton.\r\nHamilton made several just criticisms on different parts of it. But\r\nwhere I asserted that the United States had no right to alienate an inch\r\nof the territory of any State, he attacked and denied the doctrine.\r\nSee my report, his note, and my answer. A few days after came to hand\r\nKirkland’s letter, informing us that the British, at Niagara, expected\r\nto run a new line between themselves and us; and the reports of Pond\r\nand Stedman, informing us it was understood at Niagara, that Captain\r\nStevenson had been sent here by Simcoe to settle that plan with Hammond.\r\nHence Hamilton’s attack of the principle I had laid down, in order to\r\nprepare the way for this new line. See minute of March the 9th. Another\r\nproof. At one of our consultations, about the last of December, I\r\nmentioned that I wished to give in my report on commerce, in which I\r\ncould not avoid recommending a commercial retaliation against Great\r\nBritain. Hamilton opposed it violently: and among other arguments,\r\nobserved, that it was of more importance to us to have the posts than to\r\ncommence a commercial war; that this, and this alone, would free us from\r\nthe expense of the Indian wars; that it would therefore be the height\r\nof imprudence in us, while treating for the surrender of the posts, to\r\nengage in any thing which would irritate them; that if we did so, they\r\nwould naturally say, ‘These people mean war; let us therefore hold what\r\nwe have in our hands.’ This argument, struck me forcibly, and I\r\nsaid, ‘If there is a hope of obtaining the posts, I agree it would\r\nbe imprudent to risk that hope by a commercial retaliation. I will,\r\ntherefore, wait till Mr. Hammond gives me in his assignment of breaches,\r\nand if that gives a glimmering of hope that they mean to surrender the\r\nposts, I will not give in my report till the next session.’ Now, Hammond\r\nhad received my assignment of breaches on the 15th of December, and\r\nabout the 22nd or 23rd had made me an apology for not having been able\r\nto send me his counter-assignment of breaches; but in terms which showed\r\nI might expect it in a few days. From the moment it escaped my lips\r\nin the presence of Hamilton, that I would not give in my report till I\r\nshould see Hammond’s counter-complaint, and judge if there was a hope\r\nof the posts, Hammond never said a word to me on any occasion, as to the\r\ntime he should be ready. At length the President got out of patience,\r\nand insisted I should jog him. This I did on the 21st of February, at\r\nthe President’s assembly: he immediately promised I should have it in a\r\nfew days, and accordingly, on the 5th of March I received it.\r\n\r\nWritten March the 11th, 1792.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch the 12th, 1792. Sent for by the President, and desired to bring\r\nthe letter he had signed to the King of France. Went. He said the House\r\nof Representatives had, on Saturday, taken up the communication he had\r\nmade of the King’s letter to him, and come to a vote in their own name;\r\nthat he did not expect this when he sent this message and the letter,\r\notherwise he would have sent the message without the letter, as I had\r\nproposed. That he apprehended the legislature would be endeavoring\r\nto invade the executive. I told him, I had understood the House had\r\nresolved to request him to join their congratulations to his on the\r\ncompletion and acceptance of the constitution; on which part of the\r\nvote, there were only two dissentients (Barnwell and Benson); that\r\nthe vote was thirty-five to sixteen on the part which expressed an\r\napprobation of the wisdom of the constitution; that in the letter he had\r\nsigned, I had avoided saying a word in approbation of the constitution,\r\nnot knowing whether the King, in his heart, approved it. ‘Why, indeed,’\r\nsays he,’ I begin to doubt very much of the affairs of France; there are\r\npapers from London as late as the 10th of January, which represent them\r\nas going into confusion. He read over the letter he had signed,\r\nfound there was not a word which could commit his judgment about the\r\nconstitution, and gave it to me back again. This is one of many proofs\r\nI have had, of his want of confidence in the event of the French\r\nrevolution. The fact is, that Gouverneur Morris, a highflying monarchy\r\nman, shutting his eyes and his faith to every fact against his\r\nwishes, and believing every thing he desires to be true, has kept the\r\nPresident’s mind constantly poisoned with his forebodings. That the\r\nPresident wishes the revolution may be established, I believe from\r\nseveral indications. I remember, when I received the news of the King’s\r\nflight and capture, I first told him of it at his assembly. I never saw\r\nhim so much dejected by any event in my life. He expressed clearly, on\r\nthis occasion, his disapprobation of the legislature referring things to\r\nthe Heads of departments.\r\n\r\nWritten March the 12th.\r\n\r\nEodem die. Ten o’clock, A. M. The preceding was about nine o’clock. The\r\nPresident now sends Lear to me, to ask what answer he shall give to\r\nthe committee, and particularly, whether he shall add to it, that, ‘in\r\nmaking the communication, it was not his expectation that the House\r\nshould give any answer.’ I told Mr. Lear, that I thought the House had\r\na right, independently of legislation, to express sentiments on other\r\nsubjects. That when these subjects did not belong to any other branch\r\nparticularly, they would publish them by their own authority; that in\r\nthe present case, which respected a foreign nation, the President being\r\nthe organ of our nation with other nations, the House would satisfy\r\ntheir duty, if, instead of a direct communication, they should pass\r\ntheir sentiments through the President: that if expressing a sentiment\r\nwere really an invasion of the executive power, it was so faint a one,\r\nthat it would be difficult to demonstrate it to the public, and to a\r\npublic partial to the French revolution, and not disposed to considered\r\nthe approbation of it from any quarter is improper. That the Senate,\r\nindeed, had given many indications of their wish to invade the executive\r\npower: the Representatives had done it in one case, which was indeed\r\nmischievous and alarming; that of giving orders to the Heads of the\r\nexecutive departments, without consulting the President; but that the\r\nlate vote for directing the Secretary of the Treasury to report ways and\r\nmeans, though carried, was carried by so small a majority, and with the\r\naid of members so notoriously under local influence on that question,\r\nas to give a hope that the practice would be arrested, and the\r\nconstitutional course be taken up, of asking the President to have\r\ninformation laid before them. But that in the present instance, it was\r\nso far from being clearly an invasion of the executive, and would be\r\nso little approved by the general voice, that I could not advise the\r\nPresident to express any dissatisfaction at the vote of the House; and I\r\ngave Lear, in writing, what I thought should be his answers. See it.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch the 31st. A meeting at the President’s; present, Thomas Jefferson,\r\nAlexander Hamilton, Henry Knox, and Edmund Randolph. The subject was\r\nthe resolution of the House of Representatives, of March the 27th, to\r\nappoint a committee to inquire into the causes of the failure of the\r\nlate expedition under Major General St. Clair, with the power to call\r\nfor such persons, papers, and records, as may be necessary to assist\r\ntheir inquiries. The committee had written to Knox for the original\r\nletters, instructions, &tc. The President had called us to consult,\r\nmerely because it was the first example, and he wished that so far as\r\nit should become a precedent, it should be rightly conducted. He neither\r\nacknowledged nor denied, nor even doubted the propriety of what the\r\nHouse were doing, for he had not thought upon it, nor was acquainted\r\nwith subjects of this kind: he could readily conceive there might be\r\npapers of so secret a nature, as that they ought not to be given up. We\r\nwere not prepared, and wished time to think and inquire.\r\n\r\n\r\nApril the 2nd. Met again at the President’s, on the same subject. We\r\nhad all considered, and were of one mind, first, that the House was\r\nan inquest, and therefore might institute inquiries. Secondly, that it\r\nmight call for papers generally. Thirdly, that the executive ought to\r\ncommunicate such papers as the public good would permit, and ought\r\nto refuse those, the disclosure of which would injure the public:\r\nconsequently were to exercise a discretion. Fourthly, that neither the\r\ncommittee nor House had a right to call on the Head of a department, who\r\nand whose papers were under the President alone; but that the committee\r\nshould instruct their chairman to move the House to address the\r\nPresident. We had principally consulted the proceedings of the Commons\r\nin the case of Sir Robert Walpole, 13 Chandler’s Debates. For the first\r\npoint, seepages 161, 170, 172,183, 187,207; for the second, pages 153,\r\n173,207; for the third, 81, 173, Appendix, page 44; for the fourth, page\r\n246. Note: Hamilton agreed with us in all these points, except as to the\r\npower of the House to call on Heads of departments. He observed, that\r\nas to his department, the act constituting it had made it subject to\r\nCongress, in some points, but he thought himself not so far subject, as\r\nto be obliged to produce all the papers they might call for. They might\r\ndemand secrets of a very mischievous nature. [Here I thought he began\r\nto fear they would go to examining how far their own members and other\r\npersons in the government had been dabbling in stocks, banks, &c. and\r\nthat he probably would choose in this case to deny their power; and,\r\nin short, he endeavored to place himself subject to the House, when\r\nthe executive should propose what he did not like, and subject to the\r\nexecutive, when the House should propose any thing disagreeable.]\r\nI observed here a difference between the British parliament and our\r\nCongress; that the former was a legislature, an inquest, and a council\r\n(S. C. page 91.) for the King. The latter was, by the constitution, a\r\nlegislature and an inquest, but not a council. Finally agreed, to speak\r\nseparately to the members of the committee, and bring them by persuasion\r\ninto the right channel. It was agreed in this case, that there was not\r\na paper which might not be properly produced; that copies only should be\r\nsent, with an assurance, that if they should desire it, a clerk should\r\nattend with the originals to be verified by themselves. The committee\r\nwere Fitzsimmons, Steele, Mercer, Clarke, Sedgwick, Giles, and Vining.\r\n\r\n\r\nApril the 9th, 1792. The President had wished to redeem our captives at\r\nAlgiers, and to make a peace with them on paying an annual tribute. The\r\nSenate were willing to approve this, but unwilling to have the lower\r\nHouse applied to previously to furnish the money; they wished the\r\nPresident to take the money from the treasury, or open a loan for it.\r\nThey thought that to consult the Representatives on one occasion,\r\nwould give them a handle always to claim it, and would let them into a\r\nparticipation of the power of making treaties, which the constitution\r\nhad given exclusively to the President and Senate. They said, too, that\r\nif the particular sum was noted by the Representatives, it would not be\r\na secret. The President had no confidence in the secrecy of the Senate,\r\nand did not choose to take money from the treasury or to borrow. But he\r\nagreed he would enter into provisional treaties with the Algerines,\r\nnot to be binding on us till ratified here. I prepared questions for\r\nconsultation with the Senate, and added, that the Senate were to be\r\napprized, that on the return of the provisional treaty, and after they\r\nshould advise the ratification, he would not have the seal put to it\r\ntill the two Houses should vote the money. He asked me, if the treaty\r\nstipulating a sum and ratified by him, with the advice of the Senate,\r\nwould not be good under the constitution, and obligatory on the\r\nRepresentatives to furnish the money. I answered, it certainly would,\r\nand that it would be the duty of the Representatives to raise the money;\r\nbut that they might decline to do what was their duty, and I thought it\r\nmight be incautious to commit himself by a ratification with a foreign\r\nnation, where he might be left in the lurch in the execution: it was\r\npossible too, to conceive a treaty, which it would not be their duty\r\nto provide for. He said that he did not like throwing too much into\r\ndemocratic hands, that if they would not do what the constitution called\r\non them to do, the government would be at an end, and must then assume\r\nanother form. He stopped here; and I kept silence to see whether\r\nhe would say any thing more in the same line, or add any qualifying\r\nexpression to soften what he had said: but he did neither. I had\r\nobserved, that wherever the agency of either, or both Houses would be\r\nrequisite subsequent to a treaty, to carry it into effect, it would be\r\nprudent to consult them previously, if the occasion admitted. That thus\r\nit was, we were in the habit of consulting the Senate previously, when\r\nthe occasion permitted, because their subsequent ratification would be\r\nnecessary. That there was the same reason for consulting the lower House\r\npreviously, where they were to be called on afterwards, and especially\r\nin the case of money, as they held the purse-strings, and would be\r\njealous of them. However, he desired me to strike out the intimation\r\nthat the seal would not be put till both Houses should have voted the\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n\r\nApril the 6th. The President called on me before breakfast, and first\r\nintroduced some other matter, then fell on the representation bill,\r\nwhich he had now in his possession for the tenth day. I had before given\r\nhim my opinion in writing, that the method of apportionment was contrary\r\nto the constitution. He agreed that it was contrary to the common\r\nunderstanding of that instrument, and to what was understood at the time\r\nby the makers of it: that, yet it would bear the construction which the\r\nbill put, and he observed that the vote for and against the bill was\r\nperfectly geographical, a northern against a southern vote, and he\r\nfeared he should be thought to be taking side with a southern party. I\r\nadmitted the motive of delicacy, but that it should not induce him to\r\ndo wrong: urged the dangers to which the scramble for the fractionary\r\nmembers would always lead. He here expressed his fear that there would,\r\nere long, be a separation of the Union; that the public mind seemed\r\ndissatisfied and tending to this. He went home, sent for Randolph, the\r\nAttorney General, desired him to get Mr. Madison immediately and come\r\nto me, and if we three concurred in opinion that he should negative the\r\nbill, he desired to hear nothing more about it, but that we would draw\r\nthe instrument for him to sign. They came. Our minds had been before\r\nmade up.\r\n\r\nWe drew the instrument. Randolph carried it to him, and told him we\r\nall concurred in it. He walked with him to the door, and as if he still\r\nwished to get off, he said, ‘And you say you approve of this yourself.’\r\n‘Yes, Sir,’ says Randolph, ‘I do upon my honor.’ He sent it to the House\r\nof Representatives instantly. A few of the hottest friends of the bill\r\nexpressed passion, but the majority were satisfied, and both in and\r\nout of doors it gave pleasure to have, at length, an instance of the\r\nnegative being exercised.\r\n\r\nWritten this the 9th of April.\r\n\r\n\r\nJuly the 10th, 1792. My letter of ---- to the President, directed to him\r\nat Mount Vernon, had not found him there, but came to him here. He told\r\nme of this, and that he would take an occasion of speaking with me on\r\nthe subject. He did so this day. He began by observing that he had put\r\nit off from day to day, because the subject was painful; to wit, his\r\nremaining in office, which that letter solicited. He said that the\r\ndeclaration he had made when he quitted his military command, of never\r\nagain entering into public life, was sincere. That, however, when he was\r\ncalled on to come forward to set the present government in motion,\r\nit appeared to him that circumstances were so changed as to justify a\r\nchange in his resolution: he was made to believe that in two years all\r\nwould be well in motion, and he might retire. At the end of two years\r\nhe found some things still to be done. At the end of the third year, he\r\nthought it was not worth while to disturb the course of things, as\r\nin one year more his office would expire, and he was decided then to\r\nretire. Now he was told there would still be danger in it. Certainly,\r\nif he thought so, he would conquer his longing for retirement. But he\r\nfeared it would be said his former professions of retirement had been\r\nmere affectation, and that he was like other men, when once in office\r\nhe could not quit it. He was sensible, too, of a decay of his hearing,\r\nperhaps his other faculties might fall off and he not be sensible of it.\r\nThat with respect to the existing causes of uneasiness, he thought there\r\nwe’re suspicions against a particular party, which had been carried a\r\ngreat deal too far: there might be desires, but he did not believe there\r\nwere designs to change the form of government into a monarchy: that\r\nthere might be a few who wished it in the higher walks of life,\r\nparticularly in the great cities; but that the main body of the people\r\nin the eastern States were as steadily for republicanism as in the\r\nsouthern. That the pieces lately published, and particularly in\r\nFreneau’s paper, seemed to have in view the exciting opposition to\r\nthe government. That this had taken place in Pennsylvania as to the\r\nexcise-law, according to information he had received from General Hand.\r\nThat they tended to produce a separation of the Union, the most dreadful\r\nof all calamities, and that whatever tended to produce anarchy, tended,\r\nof course, to produce a resort to monarchical government. He considered\r\nthose papers as attacking him directly, for he must be a fool indeed to\r\nswallow the little sugar-plumbs here and there thrown out to him. That\r\nin condemning the administration of the government, they condemned\r\nhim, for if they thought there were measures pursued contrary to his\r\nsentiments, they must conceive him too careless to attend to them, or\r\ntoo stupid to understand them. That though, indeed, he had signed many\r\nacts which he did not approve in all their parts, yet he had never put\r\nhis name to one which he did not think, on the whole, was eligible. That\r\nas to the bank, which had been an act of so much complaint, until there\r\nwas some infallible criterion of reason, a difference of opinion must be\r\ntolerated. He did not believe the discontents extended far from the seat\r\nof government. He had seen and spoken with many people in Maryland and\r\nVirginia in his late journey. He found the people contented and\r\nhappy. He wished, however, to be better informed on this head. If the\r\ndiscontents were more extensive than he supposed, it might be, that the\r\ndesire that he should remain in the government was not general.\r\n\r\nMy observations to him tended principally to enforce the topics of my\r\nletter. I will not, therefore, repeat them, except where they produced\r\nobservations from him. I said, that the two great complaints were, that\r\nthe national debt was unnecessarily increased, and that it had furnished\r\nthe means of corrupting both branches of the legislature; that he must\r\nknow, and every body knew, there was a considerable squadron in both,\r\nwhose votes were devoted to the paper and stock-jobbing interest, that\r\nthe names of a weighty number were known, and several others suspected\r\non good grounds. That on examining the votes of these men, they would\r\nbe found uniformly for every Treasury measure, and that as most of these\r\nmeasures had been carried by small majorities, they were carried by\r\nthese very votes. That, therefore, it was a cause of just uneasiness,\r\nwhen we saw a legislature legislating for their own interests, in\r\nopposition to those of the people. He said not a word on the corruption\r\nof the legislature, but took up the other point, defended the\r\nAssumption, and argued that it had not increased the debt, for that all\r\nof it was honest debt. He justified the excise-law, as one of the best\r\nlaws which could be passed, as nobody would pay the tax who did not\r\nchoose to do it. With respect to the increase of the debt by the\r\nAssumption, I observed to him, that what was meant and objected to was,\r\nthat it increased the debt of the General Government, and carried\r\nit beyond the possibility of payment. That if the balances had been\r\nsettled, and the debtor States directed to pay their deficiencies to\r\nthe creditor States, they would have done it easily, and by resources of\r\ntaxation in their power, and acceptable to the people; by a direct tax\r\nin the south, and an excise in the north. Still, he said, it would\r\nbe paid by the people. Finding him decided, I avoided entering into\r\nargument with him on those points.\r\n\r\n\r\nBladensburg, October the 1st, 1792. This morning, at Mount Vernon, I\r\nhad the following conversation with the President. He opened it by\r\nexpressing his regret at the resolution in which I appeared so fixed, in\r\nthe letter I had written him, of retiring from public affairs. He said,\r\nthat he should be extremely sorry that I should do it, as long as he\r\nwas in office, and that he could not see where he should find another\r\ncharacter to fill my office. That as yet, he was quite undecided whether\r\nto retire in March or not. His inclinations led him strongly to do it.\r\nNobody disliked more the ceremonies of his office, and he had not the\r\nleast taste or gratification in the execution of its functions. That he\r\nwas happy at home alone, and that his presence there was now peculiarly\r\ncalled for by the situation of Major Washington, whom he thought\r\nirrecoverable, and should he get well, he would remove into another\r\npart of the country, which might better agree with him. That he did not\r\nbelieve his presence necessary; that there were other characters who\r\nwould do the business as well or better. Still, however, if his aid was\r\nthought necessary to save the cause to which he had devoted his life\r\nprincipally, he would make the sacrifice of a longer continuance. That\r\nhe therefore reserved himself for future decision, as his declaration\r\nwould be in time if made a month before the day of election. He had\r\ndesired Mr. Lear to find out from conversation, without appearing to\r\nmake the inquiry, whether any other person would be desired by any\r\nbody. He had informed him, he judged from conversations that it was\r\nthe universal desire he should continue, and he believed that those\r\nwho expressed a doubt of his continuance, did it in the language of\r\napprehension, and not of desire. But this, says he, is only from the\r\nnorth; it may be very different in the south. I thought this meant as\r\nan opening to me to say what was the sentiment in the south, from which\r\nquarter I came. I told him, that as far as I knew, there was but one\r\nvoice there, which was for his continuance. That as to myself, I had\r\never preferred the pursuits of private life to those of public,\r\nwhich had nothing in them agreeable to me. I explained to him the\r\ncircumstances of the war which had first called me into public life, and\r\nthose following the war, which had called me from a retirement on which\r\nI had determined. That I had constantly kept my eye on my own home,\r\nand could no longer refrain from returning to it. As to himself, his\r\npresence was important; that he was the only man in the United States\r\nwho possessed the confidence of the whole; that government was founded\r\nin opinion and confidence, and that the longer he remained, the stronger\r\nwould become the habits of the people in submitting to the government,\r\nand in thinking it a thing to be maintained; that there was no other\r\nperson, who would be thought any thing more than the head of a party. He\r\nthen expressed his concern at the difference which he found to subsist\r\nbetween the Secretary of the Treasury and myself, of which he said he\r\nhad not been aware. He knew, indeed, that there was a marked difference\r\nin our political sentiments, but he had never suspected it had gone so\r\nfar in producing a personal difference, and he wished he could be the\r\nmediator to put an end to it. That he thought it important to preserve\r\nthe check of my opinions in the administration, in order to keep things\r\nin their proper channel, and prevent them from going too far. That as\r\nto the idea of transforming this government into a monarchy, he did\r\nnot believe there were ten men in the United States whose opinions were\r\nworth attention, who entertained such a thought. I told him there were\r\nmany more than he imagined. I recalled to his memory a dispute at\r\nhis own table, a little before we left Philadelphia, between General\r\nSchuyler on one side and Pinckney and myself on the other, wherein the\r\nformer maintained the position, that hereditary descent was as likely to\r\nproduce good magistrates as election. I told him, that though the\r\npeople were sound, there were a numerous sect who had monarchy in\r\ncontemplation; that the Secretary of the Treasury was one of these. That\r\nI had heard him say that this constitution was a shilly-shally thing, of\r\nmere milk and water, which could not last, and was only good as a step\r\nto something better. That when we reflected, that he had endeavored in\r\nthe convention, to make an English constitution of it, and when failing\r\nin that, we saw all his measures tending to bring it to the same thing,\r\nit was natural for us to be jealous; and particularly, when we saw that\r\nthese measures had established corruption in the legislature, where\r\nthere was a squadron devoted to the nod of the Treasury, doing whatever\r\nhe had directed, and ready to do what he should direct. That if the\r\nequilibrium of the three great bodies, legislative, executive, and\r\njudiciary, could be preserved, if the legislature could be kept\r\nindependent, I should never fear the result of such a government;\r\nbut that I could not but be uneasy, when I saw that the executive had\r\nswallowed up the legislative branch. He said, that as to that interested\r\nspirit in the legislature, it was what could not be avoided in any\r\ngovernment, unless we were to exclude particular descriptions of men,\r\nsuch as the holders of the funds, from all office. I told him, there was\r\ngreat difference between the little accidental schemes of self-interest,\r\nwhich would take place in every body of men, and influence their votes,\r\nand a regular system for forming a corps of interested persons, who\r\nshould be steadily at the orders of the Treasury. He touched on the\r\nmerits of the funding system, observed there was a difference of opinion\r\nabout it, some thinking it very bad, others very good; that experience\r\nwas the only criterion of right which he knew, and this alone would\r\ndecide which opinion was right. That for himself, he had seen our\r\naffairs desperate and our credit lost, and that this was in a sudden and\r\nextraordinary degree raised to the highest pitch. I told him, all that\r\nwas ever necessary to establish our credit, was an efficient government\r\nand an honest one, declaring it would sacredly pay our debts, laying\r\ntaxes for this purpose, and applying them to it. I avoided going further\r\ninto the subject. He finished by another exhortation to me not to decide\r\ntoo positively on retirement, and here we were called to breakfast.\r\n\r\n\r\nOctober the 31st, 1792. I had sent to the President, Viar and Jaudenes’s\r\nletter of the 29th instant, whereupon he desired a consultation of\r\nHamilton, Knox, E. Randolph, and myself, on these points. 1. What notice\r\nwas to be taken hereof to Spain. 2. Whether it should make part of the\r\ncommunication to the legislature. I delivered my opinion, that it ought\r\nto be communicated to both Houses, because the communications intended\r\nto be made, being to bring on the question, whether they would declare\r\nwar against any, and which of the nations or parts of the nations of\r\nIndians to the south, it would be proper this information should be\r\nbefore them, that they might know how far such a declaration would lead\r\nthem. There might be some who would be for war against the Indians, if\r\nit were to stop there, but who would not be for it, if it were to lead\r\nto a war against Spain. I thought it should be laid before both Houses,\r\nbecause it concerned the question of declaring war, which was the\r\nfunction equally of both Houses. I thought a simple acknowledgment of\r\nthe receipt of the letter should be made by me to the Spanish Charges,\r\nexpressing that it contained some things very unexpected to us, but that\r\nwe should refer the whole, as they had proposed, to the negotiators\r\nat Madrid. This would secure to us a continuation of the suspension\r\nof Indian hostilities, which the Governor of New Orleans said he had\r\nbrought about till the result of the negotiation at Madrid should be\r\nknown; would not commit us as to running or not running the line, or\r\nimply any admission of doubt about our tentorial right; and would avoid\r\na rupture with Spain, which was much to be desired, while we had similar\r\npoints to discuss with Great Britain. Hamilton declared himself the\r\nadvocate for peace. War would derange our affairs greatly; throw us\r\nback many years in the march towards prosperity; be difficult for us to\r\npursue, our countrymen not being disposed to become soldiers; a part\r\nof the Union feeling no interest in the war, would with difficulty be\r\nbrought to exert itself; and we had no navy. He was for every thing\r\nwhich would procrastinate the event. A year, even, was a great gain to a\r\nnation strengthening as we were. It laid open to us, too, the chapter\r\nof accidents, which in the present state of Europe, was a very pregnant\r\none. That while, however, he was for delaying the event of war, he had\r\nno doubt it was to take place between us for the object in question:\r\nthat jealousy and perseverance were remarkable features in the character\r\nof the Spanish government, with respect to their American possessions;\r\nthat so far from receding as to their claims against us, they had\r\nbeen strengthening themselves in them. He had no doubt the present\r\ncommunication was by authority from the court. Under this impression\r\nhe thought we should be looking forward to the day of rupture, and\r\npreparing for it. That if we were unequal to the contest ourselves, it\r\nbehoved us to provide allies for our aid. That in this view, but two\r\nnations could be named, France and England. France was too intimately\r\nconnected with Spain in other points, and of too great mutual value,\r\never to separate for us. Her affairs too, were such, that whatever\r\nissue they had, she could not be in a situation to make a respectable\r\nmediation for us. England alone, then, remained. It would not be easy to\r\neffect it with her; however, he was for trying it, and for sounding them\r\non the proposition of a defensive treaty of alliance. The inducements to\r\nsuch a treaty, on their part, might be, 1. The desire of breaking up our\r\nformer connections, which we knew they had long wished. 2. A continuance\r\nof the statu quo in commerce for ten years, which he believed would\r\nbe desirable to them. 3. An admission to some navigable part of the\r\nMississippi, by some line drawn from the Lake of the Woods to such\r\nnavigable part. He had not, he said, examined the map to see how such\r\na line might be run, so as not to make too great a sacrifice. The\r\nnavigation of the Mississippi being a joint possession, we might\r\nthen take measures in concert for the joint security of it. He was,\r\ntherefore, for immediately sounding them on this subject through our\r\nminister at London; yet so as to keep ourselves unengaged as long as\r\npossible, in hopes a favorable issue with Spain might be otherwise\r\neffected. But he was for sounding immediately, and for not letting slip\r\nan opportunity of securing our object.\r\n\r\nE. Randolph concurred, in general, with me. He objected that such a\r\nreliance could not be effected without pecuniary consideration probably,\r\nwhich he could not give. And what was to be their aid? If men, our\r\ncitizens would see their armies get foothold in the United States, with\r\ngreat jealousy; it would be difficult to protect them. Even the French,\r\nduring the distresses of the late war, excited some jealous sentiments,\r\n\r\nHamilton said, money was often but not always demanded, and the aid he\r\nshould propose to stipulate would be in ships. Knox _non dissentiente_.\r\n\r\nThe President said the remedy would be worse than the disease, and\r\nstated some of the disagreeable circumstances which would attend our\r\nmaking such overtures.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovember, 1792. Hamilton called on me to speak about our furnishing\r\nsupplies to the French colony of St. Domingo. He expressed his opinion,\r\nthat we ought to be cautious, and not go too far in our application\r\nof money to their use, lest it should not be recognised by the mother\r\ncountry. He did not even think that some kinds of government they\r\nmight establish could give a sufficient sanction.* I observed, that the\r\nNational Convention was now met, and would certainly establish a form\r\nof government; that as we had recognised the former government because\r\nestablished by authority of the nation, so we must recognise any other\r\nwhich should be established by the authority of the nation. He said we\r\nhad recognised the former, because it contained an important member of\r\nthe ancient, to wit, the King, and wore the appearance of his consent;\r\nbut if, in any future form, they should omit the King, he did not know\r\nthat we could with safety recognise it, or pay money to its order.\r\n\r\n     * There had been a previous consultation at the President’s\r\n     (about the first week in November) on the expediency of\r\n     suspending payments to France, under her present situation.\r\n     I had admitted that the late constitution was dissolved by\r\n     the dethronement of the King; and the management of affairs\r\n     surviving to the National Assembly only, this was not an\r\n     integral legislature, and therefore not competent to give a\r\n     legitimate discharge for our payments: that I thought\r\n     consequently, that none should be made till some legitimate\r\n     body came into place; and that I should consider the\r\n     National Convention, called, but not met as we had yet\r\n     heard, to be a legitimate body. Hamilton doubted whether it\r\n     would be a legitimate body, and whether, if the King should\r\n     be re-established, he might not disallow such payments on\r\n     good grounds. Knox, for once, dared to differ from Hamilton,\r\n     and to express, very submissively, an opinion, that a\r\n     convention named by the whole body of the nation, would be\r\n     competent to do any thing. It ended by agreeing, that I\r\n     should write to Gouverneur Morris to suspend payment\r\n     generally, till further orders.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovember the 19th, 1792. Beckley brings me the pamphlet written by\r\nHamilton, before the war, in answer to ‘Common Sense.’ It is entitled\r\n‘Plain Truth.’ Melancthon Smith sends it to Beckley, and in his letter\r\nsays, it was not printed in New York by Loudon, because prevented by a\r\nmob, and was printed in Philadelphia, and that he has these facts from\r\nLoudon.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovember the 21st, 1792. Mr. Butler tells me, that he dined last winter\r\nwith Mr. Campbell from Denmark, in company with Hamilton, Lawrence, Dr.\r\nShippen, T. Shippen, and one other person whom he cannot recollect. That\r\nafter dinner political principles became the subject of conversation;\r\nthat Hamilton declared openly, that ‘there was no stability, no security\r\nin any kind of government but a monarchy.’ That Lawrence took him\r\nup, and entered the lists of argument against him; that the dispute\r\ncontinued long, and grew warm, remarkably so as between them; that\r\nShippen, at length, joined Lawrence in it; and in fine, that it broke up\r\nthe company. Butler recommended to the company, that the dispute having\r\nprobably gone farther than was intended, it ought to be considered as\r\nconfined to the company.\r\n\r\n\r\nThursday, December the 27th, 1792. I waited on the President on some\r\ncurrent business. After this was over, he observed to me, that he\r\nthought it was time to endeavor to effect a stricter connection with\r\nFrance, and that Gouverneur Morris should be written to on this subject.\r\nHe went into the circumstances of dissatisfaction between Spain and\r\nGreat Britain, and us, and observed, there was no nation on whom we\r\ncould rely, at all times, but France; and that, if we did not prepare\r\nin time some support, in the event of rupture with Spain and England,\r\nwe might be charged with a criminal negligence. I was much pleased with\r\nthe tone of these observations. It was the very doctrine which had been\r\nmy polar star, and I did not need the successes of the republican arms\r\nin France, lately announced to us, to bring me to these sentiments.\r\nFor it is to be noted, that on Saturday last, (the 22nd) I received Mr.\r\nShort’s letters of October the 9th and 12th, with the Leyden gazettes to\r\nOctober the 13th, giving us the first news of the retreat of the Duke of\r\nBrunswick, and the capture of Spires and Worms by Custine, and that\r\nof Nice by Anselme. I therefore expressed to the President my cordial\r\napprobation of these ideas; told him, I had meant on that day (as an\r\nopportunity of writing by the British packet would occur immediately) to\r\ntake his orders for removing the suspension of payments to France, which\r\nhad been imposed by my last letter to Gouverneur Morris, but was meant,\r\nas I supposed, only for the interval between the abolition of the late\r\nconstitution by the dethronement of the King, and the meeting of some\r\nother body, invested by the will of the nation with powers to transact\r\ntheir affairs; that I considered the National Convention, then\r\nassembled, as such a body; and that, therefore, we ought to go on with\r\nthe payments to them, or to any government they should establish; that,\r\nhowever, I had learned last night, that some clause in the bill for\r\nproviding reimbursement of the loan made by the bank to the United\r\nStates, had given rise to a question before the House of Representatives\r\nyesterday, which might affect these payments; a clause in that bill\r\nproposing, that the money formerly borrowed in Amsterdam, to pay the\r\nFrench debt, and appropriated by law (1790, August 4th, c. 34. § 2.) to\r\nthat purpose, lying dead as was suggested, should be taken to pay the\r\nbank, and the President be authorized to borrow two millions of dollars\r\nmore, out of which it should be replaced: and if this should be done,\r\nthe removal of our suspension of payments, as I had been about to\r\npropose, would be premature. He expressed his disapprobation of the\r\nclause above mentioned; thought it highly improper in the legislature to\r\nchange an appropriation once made, and added, that no one could tell in\r\nwhat that would end. I concurred, but observed, that on a division of\r\nthe House, the ayes for striking out the clause were twenty-seven, the\r\nnoes twenty-six; whereon the Speaker gave his vote against striking out,\r\nwhich divides the House: the clause for the disappropriation remained\r\nof course. I mentioned suspicions, that the whole of this was a trick\r\nto serve the bank under a great existing embarrassment; that the debt to\r\nthe bank was to be repaid by instalments; that the first instalment was\r\nof two hundred thousand dollars only, or rather one hundred and sixty\r\nthousand dollars, (because forty thousand of the two hundred thousand\r\ndollars would be the United States’ own dividend of the instalment.) Yet\r\nhere were two millions to be paid them at once, and to be taken from a\r\npurpose of gratitude and honor, to which it had been appropriated.\r\n\r\n\r\nDecember the 30th, 1792. I took the occasion furnished by Pinckney’s\r\nletter of September the 19th, asking instructions how to conduct himself\r\nas to the French revolution, to lay down the catholic principle of\r\nrepublicanism, to wit, that every people may establish what form of\r\ngovernment they please, and change it as they please; the will of the\r\nnation being the only thing essential. I was induced to do this, in\r\norder to extract the President’s opinion on the question which divided\r\nHamilton and myself in the conversation of November, 1792, and the\r\nprevious one of the first week of November, on the suspension of\r\npayments to France: and if favorable to mine, to place the principle on\r\nrecord in the letter-books of my office. I therefore wrote the letter\r\nof December the 30th, to Pinckney, and sent it to the President, and he\r\nreturned me his approbation in writing, in his note of the same date,\r\nwhich see.\r\n\r\n\r\nFebruary the 7th, 1793. I waited on the President with letters and\r\npapers from Lisbon. After going through these, I told him that I had for\r\nsome time suspended speaking with him on the subject of my going out\r\nof office, because I had understood that the bill for intercourse with\r\nforeign nations was likely to be rejected by the Senate, in which case,\r\nthe remaining business of the department would be too inconsiderable to\r\nmake it worth while to keep it up. But that the bill being now passed, I\r\nwas freed from the considerations of propriety which had embarrassed me.\r\nThat &c. [nearly in the words of a letter to Mr. T. M. Randolph, of\r\na few days ago,] and that I should be willing, if he had taken no\r\narrangements to the contrary, to continue somewhat longer, how long I\r\ncould not say, perhaps till summer, perhaps autumn. He said, so far from\r\ntaking arrangements on the subject, he had never mentioned to any mortal\r\nthe design of retiring which I had expressed to him, till yesterday,\r\nwhen having heard that I had given up my house, and that it was rented\r\nby another, he thereupon mentioned it to Mr. E. Randolph, and asked him,\r\nas he knew my retirement had been talked of, whether he had heard\r\nany persons suggested in conversation to succeed me. He expressed his\r\nsatisfaction at my change of purpose and his apprehensions that my\r\nretirement would be a new source of uneasiness to the public. He\r\nsaid Governor Lee had that day informed him of the general discontent\r\nprevailing in Virginia, of which he never had had any conception,\r\nmuch less sound information. That it appeared to him very alarming. He\r\nproceeded to express his earnest wish that Hamilton and myself could\r\ncoalesce in the measures of the government, and urged here the general\r\nreasons for it, which he had done to me in two former conversations.\r\nHe said he had proposed the same thing to Hamilton, who expressed\r\nhis readiness, and he thought our coalition would secure the general\r\nacquiescence of the public. I told him my concurrence was of much less\r\nimportance than he seemed to imagine; that I kept myself aloof from all\r\ncabal and correspondence on the subject with the government, and saw and\r\nspoke with as few as I could. That as to a coalition with Mr. Hamilton,\r\nif by that was meant that either was to sacrifice his general system\r\nto the other, it was impossible. We had both, no doubt, formed our\r\nconclusions after the most mature consideration; and principles\r\nconscientiously adopted, could not be given up on either side. My wish\r\nwas, to see both Houses of Congress cleansed of all persons interested\r\nin the bank or public stocks: and that a pure legislature being given\r\nus, I should always be ready to acquiesce under their determinations,\r\neven if contrary to my own opinions; for that I subscribe to the\r\nprinciple, that the will of the majority, honestly expressed, should\r\ngive law. I confirmed him in the fact of the great discontents to\r\nthe south; that they were grounded on seeing that their judgments\r\nand interests were sacrificed to those of the eastern States on every\r\noccasion, and their belief that it was the effect of a corrupt squadron\r\nof voters in Congress, at the command of the Treasury; and they see that\r\nif the votes of those members who had any interest distinct from,\r\nand contrary to the general interest of their constituents, had been\r\nwithdrawn, as in decency and honesty they should have been, the laws\r\nwould have been the reverse of what they are on all the great questions.\r\nI instanced the new Assumption carried in the House of Representatives\r\nby the Speaker’s vote. On this subject he made no reply. He explained\r\nhis remaining in office to have been the effect of strong solicitations\r\nafter he returned here; declaring that he had never mentioned his\r\npurpose of going out but to the Heads of departments and Mr. Madison; he\r\nexpressed the extreme wretchedness of his existence while in office,\r\nand went lengthily into the late attacks on him for levees, &c.\r\nand explained to me how he had been led into them by the persons he\r\nconsulted at New York; and that if he could but know what the sense of\r\nthe public was, he would most cheerfully conform to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nFebruary the 16th, 1793. E. Randolph tells J. Madison and myself, a\r\ncurious fact which he had from Lear. When the President went to New\r\nYork, he resisted for three weeks the efforts to introduce levees. At\r\nlength he yielded, and left it to Humphreys and some others to settle\r\nthe forms. Accordingly, an antechamber and presence-room were provided,\r\nand when those who were to pay their court were assembled, the President\r\nset out, preceded by Humphreys. After passing through the antechamber,\r\nthe door of the inner room was thrown open, and Humphreys entered first,\r\ncalling out with a loud voice, ‘The President of the United States.’ The\r\nPresident was so much disconcerted with it, that he did not recover it\r\nthe whole time of the levee, and when the company was gone, he said\r\nto Humphreys, ‘Well, you have taken me in once, but, by God, you shall\r\nnever take me in a second time.’\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that the rejection of the late additional\r\nAssumption by the Senate was effected by the President through Lear,\r\noperating on Langdon. Beckley knows this.\r\n\r\n\r\nFebruary the 26th, 1793. Notes on the proceedings of yesterday. [See the\r\nformal opinions given to the President in writing, and signed.]\r\n\r\nFirst question. We were all of opinion that the treaty should proceed\r\nmerely to gratify the public opinion, and not from an expectation of\r\nsuccess. I expressed myself strongly, that the event was so unpromising,\r\nthat I thought the preparations for a campaign should go on without the\r\nleast relaxation, and that a day should be fixed with the commissioners\r\nfor the treaty, beyond which they should not permit the treaty to be\r\nprotracted, by which day, orders should be given for our forces to enter\r\ninto action. The President took up the thing instantly, after I had said\r\nthis, and declared he was so much in the opinion that the treaty would\r\nend in nothing, that he then, in the presence of us all, gave orders to\r\nGeneral Knox, not to slacken the preparations for the campaign in the\r\nleast, but to exert every nerve in preparing for it. Knox said something\r\nabout the ultimate day for continuing the negotiations. I acknowledged\r\nmyself not a judge on what day the campaign should begin, but that\r\nwhatever it was, that day should terminate the treaty. Knox said he\r\nthought a winter campaign was always the most efficacious against the\r\nIndians. I was of opinion, since Great Britain insisted on furnishing\r\nprovisions, that we should offer to repay. Hamilton thought we should\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nSecond question. I considered our right of preemption of the\r\nIndian lands, not as amounting to any dominion, or jurisdiction, or\r\nparamountship whatever, but merely in the nature of a remainder after\r\nthe extinguishment of a present right, which gave us no present right\r\nwhatever, but of preventing other nations from taking possession, and so\r\ndefeating our expectancy; that the Indians had the full, undivided, and\r\nindependent sovereignty as long as they chose to keep it, and that this\r\nmight be for ever; that as fast as we extend our rights by purchase from\r\nthem, so fast we extend the limits of our society, and as soon as a new\r\nportion became encircled within our line, it became a fixed limit of\r\nour society: that the executive, with either or both branches of the\r\nlegislature, could not alien any part of our territory; that by the\r\nlaw of nations it was settled, that the unity and indivisibility of\r\nthe society was so fundamental, that it could not be dismembered by the\r\nconstituted authorities, except, 1. where all power was delegated to\r\nthem (as in the case of despotic governments,) or, 2. where it was\r\nexpressly delegated; that neither of these delegations had been made\r\nto our General Government, and, therefore, that it had no right\r\nto dismember or alienate any portion of territory once ultimately\r\nconsolidated with us; and that we could no more cede to the Indians\r\nthan to the English or Spaniards, as it might, according to acknowledged\r\nprinciples, remain as irrevocably and eternally with the one as the\r\nother. But I thought, that, as we had a right to sell and settle lands\r\nonce comprehended within our lines, so we might forbear to exercise\r\nthat right, retaining the property, till circumstances should be more\r\nfavorable to the settlement, and this I agreed to do in the present\r\ninstance, if necessary for peace.\r\n\r\nHamilton agreed to the doctrine of the law of nations, as laid down in\r\nEurope, but that it was founded on the universality of settlement there;\r\nconsequently that no lopping-off of territory could be made without a\r\nlopping-off of citizens, which required their consent; but that the law\r\nof nations for us, must be adapted to the circumstance of our unsettled\r\ncountry, which he conceived the President and Senate may cede: that\r\nthe power of treaty was given to them by the constitution, without\r\nrestraining it to particular objects; consequently that it was given in\r\nas plenipotentiary a form as held by any sovereign in any other society.\r\nRandolph was of opinion, there was a difference between a cession to\r\nIndians and to any others, because it only restored the ceded part to\r\nthe condition in which it was before we bought it, and consequently,\r\nthat we might buy it again hereafter: therefore, he thought the\r\nexecutive and Senate could cede it. Knox joined in the main opinion. The\r\nPresident discovered no opinion, but he made some efforts to get us to\r\njoin in some terms which could unite us all, and he seemed to direct\r\nthose efforts more towards me: but the thing could not be done.\r\n\r\nThird question. We agreed in idea as to the line to be drawn; to wit, so\r\nas to retain all lands appropriated, or granted, or reserved.\r\n\r\nFourth question. We all thought, if the Senate should be consulted, and\r\nconsequently apprized of our line, it would become known to Hammond, and\r\nwe should lose all chance of saving any thing more at the treaty than\r\nour ultimatum.\r\n\r\nThe President, at this meeting, mentioned the declaration of some\r\nperson, in a paper of Fenno, that he would commence an attack on the\r\ncharacter of Dr. Franklin. He said, the theme was to him excessively\r\ndisagreeable on other considerations, but most particularly so, as\r\nthe party seemed to do it as a means of defending him (the President)\r\nagainst the late attacks on him: that such a mode of defence would be\r\npeculiarly painful to him, and he wished it could be stopped. Hamilton\r\nand Randolph undertook to speak to Fenno to suppress it, without\r\nmentioning it as the President’s wish. Both observed, that they had\r\nheard this declaration mentioned in many companies, and that it had\r\nexcited universal horror and detestation.\r\n\r\nThe paper in Fenno must lie between two persons, viz. Adams and Izard,\r\nbecause they are the only persons who could know such facts as are there\r\npromised to be unfolded. Adams is an enemy to both characters, and might\r\nchoose this ground as an effectual position to injure both. Izard hated\r\nFranklin with unparalleled bitterness, but humbly adores the President,\r\nbecause he is in _loco regis_. If the paper proceeds, we shall easily\r\ndiscover which of these two gentlemen is the champion. In the mean time,\r\nthe first paper leads our suspicions more towards Izard than Adams, from\r\nthe circumstance of style, and because he is quite booby enough not to\r\nsee the injury he would do to the President by such a mode of defence.\r\n\r\n\r\nFebruary the 28th. Knox, E. Randolph, and myself met at Knox’s, where\r\nHamilton was also to have met, to consider the time, manner, and place\r\nof the President’s swearing in. Hamilton had been there before, and\r\nhad left his opinion with Knox; to wit, that the President should ask\r\na judge to attend him in his own house to administer the oath, in the\r\npresence of the Heads of departments; which oath should be deposited in\r\nthe Secretary of State’s office. I concurred in this opinion. Randolph\r\nwas for the President’s going to the Senate chamber to take the oath,\r\nattended by the marshal of the United States, who should then make\r\nproclamation, &c. Knox was for this, and for adding the House of\r\nRepresentatives to the presence, as they would not yet be departed. Our\r\nindividual opinions were written, to be communicated to the President,\r\nout of which he might form one. In the course of our conversation,\r\nKnox, stickling for parade, got into great warmth, and swore that our\r\ngovernment must either be entirely new modeled, or it would be knocked\r\nto pieces in less than ten years; and that, as it is at present, he\r\nwould not give a copper for it; that it is the President’s character,\r\nand not the written constitution which keeps it together.\r\n\r\nSame day. Conversation with Lear. He expressed the strongest confidence\r\nthat republicanism was the universal creed of America, except of a very\r\nfew; that a republican administration must of necessity immediately\r\noverbear the contrary faction; said that he had seen with extreme\r\nregret, that a number of gentlemen had for a long time been endeavoring\r\nto instil into the President, that the noise against the administration\r\nof the government was that of a little faction, which would soon be\r\nsilent, and which was detested by the people, who were contented and\r\nprosperous: that this very party, however, began to see their error, and\r\nthat the sense of America was bursting forth to their conviction.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch the 2nd, 1793. See, in the papers of this date, Mr. Giles’s\r\nresolutions. He and one or two others were sanguine enough to believe,\r\nthat the palpableness of these resolutions rendered it impossible the\r\nHouse could reject them. Those who knew the composition of the House, 1.\r\nof bank directors, 2. holders of bank stock, 3. stock-jobbers, 4. blind\r\ndevotees, 5. ignorant persons who did not comprehend them, 6. lazy and\r\ngood-humored persons, who comprehended and acknowledged them, yet were\r\ntoo lazy to examine, or unwilling to pronounce censure; the persons who\r\nknew these characters, foresaw, that the three first descriptions making\r\none third of the House, the three latter would make one half of the\r\nresidue; and of course, that they would be rejected by a majority of\r\ntwo to one. But they thought, that even this rejection would do good, by\r\nshowing the public the desperate and abandoned dispositions with which\r\ntheir affairs were conducted. The resolutions were proposed, and nothing\r\nspared to present them in the fulness of demonstration. There were not\r\nmore than three or four who voted otherwise than had been expected.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch the 30th, 1793. At our meeting at the President’s, February the\r\n25th, in discussing the question, whether we should furnish to France\r\nthe three millions of livres desired, Hamilton, in speaking on the\r\nsubject, used this expression; ‘When Mr. Genet arrives, whether we\r\nshall receive him or not, will then be a question for discussion’; which\r\nexpression I did not recollect till E. Randolph reminded me of it a few\r\ndays after. Therefore, on the 20th instant, as the President was shortly\r\nto set out for Mount Vernon, I observed to him, that as Genet might\r\narrive in his absence, I wished to know beforehand how I should treat\r\nhim, whether as a person who would or would not be received. He said, he\r\ncould see no ground of doubt, but that he ought to be received. On the\r\n24th, he asked E. Randolph’s opinion on the subject, saying, he had\r\nconsulted Colonel Hamilton thereon, who went into lengthy considerations\r\nof doubt and difficulty, and viewing it as a very unfortunate thing,\r\nthat the President should have the decision of so critical a point\r\nforced on him; but in conclusion, said, since he was brought into that\r\nsituation, he did not see but that he must receive Mr. Genet. Randolph\r\ntold the President, he was clear he should be received, and the\r\nPresident said, he had never had any doubt on the subject in his mind.\r\nAfterwards on the same day, he spoke to me again on it, and said, Mr.\r\nGenet should unquestionably be received; but he thought not with too\r\nmuch warmth or Cordiality, so only as to be satisfactory to him. I\r\nwondered at first at this restriction: but when Randolph afterwards\r\ncommunicated to me his conversation of the 24th, I became satisfied it\r\nwas a small sacrifice to the opinion of Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch the 31st. Mr. Beckley tells me, that the merchants’ bonds for\r\nduties on six months’ credit became due the 1st instant, to a very great\r\namount; that Hamilton went to the bank on that day, and directed the\r\nbank to discount for those merchants all their bonds at thirty days,\r\nand that he would have the collectors credited for the money at the\r\ntreasury. Hence, the treasury lumping its receipts by the month in its\r\nprinted accounts, these sums will be considered by the public as only\r\nreceived on the last day; consequently, the bank makes the month’s\r\ninterest out of it. Beckley had this from a merchant, who had a bond\r\ndiscounted, and who supposes a million of dollars were discounted at the\r\nbank here. Mr. Brown got the same information from another merchant,\r\nwho supposed only six hundred thousand dollars discounted here. But they\r\nsuppose the same orders went to all the branch banks to a great amount.\r\n\r\nEodem die. Mr. Brown tells me he has it from a merchant here, that\r\nduring the last winter, the directors of the bank ordered the freest\r\ndiscounts. Every man could obtain it. Money being so flush, the six per\r\ncents run up to twenty-one and twenty-two shillings. Then the directors\r\nsold out their private stocks. When the discounted notes were becoming\r\ndue, they stopped discounts, and not a dollar was to be had. This\r\nreduced six per cents to eighteen shillings and three pence; then the\r\nsame directors bought in again.\r\n\r\n\r\nApril the 7th, 1793. Mr. Lear called on me, and introduced of himself a\r\nconversation on the affairs of the United States. He laughed at the\r\ncry of prosperity, and the deriving it from the establishment of the\r\ntreasury: he said, that, so far from giving in to this opinion, and that\r\nwe were paying off our national debt, he was clear the debt was growing\r\non us: that he had lately expressed this opinion to the President, who\r\nappeared much astonished at it. I told him I had given the same hint to\r\nthe President last summer, and lately again had suggested, that we\r\nwere even depending for the daily subsistence of government on borrowed\r\nmoney. He said, that was certain, and was the only way of accounting for\r\nwhat was become of the money drawn over from Holland to this country.\r\nHe regretted that the President was not in the way of hearing full\r\ninformation, declared he communicated to him every thing he could learn\r\nhimself; that the men who vaunted the present government so much on some\r\noccasions, were the very men who at other times declared it was a poor\r\nthing, and such a one as could not stand, and he was sensible they\r\nonly esteemed it as a stepping-stone to something else, and had availed\r\nthemselves of the first moments of the enthusiasm in favor of it, to\r\npervert its principles and make of it what they wanted: and that though\r\nthey raised the cry of anti-federalism against those who censured the\r\nmode of administration, yet he was satisfied, whenever it should come to\r\nbe tried, that the very men whom they called anti-federalists, were the\r\nmen who would save the government, and he looked to the next Congress\r\nfor much rectification.\r\n\r\n\r\nApril the 18th. The President sends a set of questions to be considered,\r\nand calls a meeting. Though those sent me were in his own hand-writing,\r\nyet it was palpable from the style, their ingenious tissue and suite,\r\nthat they were not the President’s, that they were raised upon a\r\nprepared chain of argument, in short, that the language was Hamilton’s,\r\nand the doubts his alone. They led to a declaration of the executive,\r\nthat our treaty with France is void. E. Randolph, the next day, told me\r\nthat the day before the date of these questions, Hamilton went with him\r\nthrough the whole chain of reasoning of which these questions are the\r\nskeleton, and that he recognised them the moment he saw them.\r\n\r\nWe met. The first question, whether we should receive the French\r\nminister, Genet, was proposed, and we agreed unanimously that he should\r\nbe received; Hamilton, at the same time, expressing his great regret\r\nthat any accident had happened, which should oblige us to recognise\r\nthe government. The next question was, whether he should be received\r\nabsolutely, or with qualifications. Here Hamilton took up the whole\r\nsubject, and went through it in the order in which the questions sketch\r\nit. See the chain of his reasoning in my opinion of April the 28th. Knox\r\nsubscribed at once to Hamilton’s opinion that we ought to declare the\r\ntreaty void, acknowledging, at the same time, like a fool as he is,\r\nthat he knew nothing about it. I was clear it remained valid. Randolph\r\ndeclared himself of the same opinion, but on Hamilton’s undertaking to\r\npresent to him the authority in Vattel (which we had not present), and\r\nto prove to him, that if the authority was admitted, the treaty might be\r\ndeclared void, Randolph agreed to take further time to consider. It was\r\nadjourned. We determined unanimously the last question, that Congress\r\nshould not be called. There having been an intimation by Randolph, that\r\nin so great a question he should choose to give a written opinion, and\r\nthis being approved by the President, I gave in mine April the 28th.\r\nHamilton gave in his. I believe Knox’s was never thought worth offering\r\nor asking for. Randolph gave his May the 6th, concurring with mine.\r\nThe President told me, the same day, he had never had a doubt about the\r\nvalidity of the treaty; but that since a question had been suggested,\r\nhe thought it ought to be considered: that this being done, I might\r\nnow issue passports to sea-vessels in the form prescribed by the French\r\ntreaty. I had for a week past only issued the Dutch form; to have issued\r\nthe French, would have been presupposing the treaty to be in existence.\r\nThe President suggested, that he thought it would be as well\r\nthat nothing should be said of such a question having been under\r\nconsideration. Written May the 6th.\r\n\r\n\r\nMay the 6th, 1793. When the question was, whether the proclamation of\r\nApril the 22nd should be issued, Randolph observed, that there should\r\nbe a letter written by me to the ministers of the belligerent powers, to\r\ndeclare that it should not be taken as conclusive evidence against our\r\ncitizens in foreign courts of admiralty, for contraband goods. Knox\r\nsuddenly adopted the opinion before Hamilton delivered his. Hamilton\r\nopposed it pretty strongly. I thought it an indifferent thing, but\r\nrather approved Randolph’s opinion. The President was against it; but\r\nobserved that, as there were three for it, it should go. This was\r\nthe first instance I had seen of an opportunity to decide by a mere\r\nmajority, including his own vote.\r\n\r\n\r\nMay the 12th. Lear called on me to-day. Speaking of the lowness of\r\nstocks (sixteen shillings), I observed it was a pity we had not money to\r\nbuy on public account. He said, yes, and that it was the more provoking,\r\nas two millions had been borrowed for that purpose, and drawn over here,\r\nand yet were not here. That he had no doubt those would take notice of\r\nthe circumstance whose duty it was to do so. I suppose he must mean the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\n\r\nMay the 23rd. I had sent to the President, yesterday, draughts of a\r\nletter from him to the Provisory Executive Council of France, and of one\r\nfrom myself to Mr. Ternant, both on the occasion of his recall. I called\r\non him to-day. He said there was an expression in one of them, which he\r\nhad never before seen in any of our public communications, to wit, ‘our\r\nrepublic’ The letter prepared for him to the Council, began thus: ‘The\r\nCitizen Ternant has delivered to me the letter wherein you inform me,\r\nthat yielding &c. you had determined to recall him from his mission, as\r\nyour Minister Plenipotentiary to our republic.’ He had underscored\r\nthe words our republic. He said that certainly ours was a republican\r\ngovernment, but yet we had not used that style in this way; that if any\r\nbody wanted to change its form into a monarchy, he was sure it was only\r\na few individuals, and that no man in the United States would set his\r\nface against it more than himself: but that this was not what he was\r\nafraid of; his fears were from another quarter; that there was more\r\ndanger of anarchy being introduced. He adverted to a piece in Freneau’s\r\npaper of yesterday; he said he despised all their attacks on him\r\npersonally, but that there never had been an act of the government, not\r\nmeaning in the executive line only, but in any line, which that paper\r\nhad not abused. He had also marked the word republic thus X, where it\r\nwas applied to the French republic. (See the original paper.) He was\r\nevidently sore and warm, and I took his intention to be, that I should\r\ninterpose in some way with Freneau, perhaps withdraw his appointment\r\nof translating clerk to my office. But I will not do it. His paper has\r\nsaved our constitution, which was galloping fast into monarchy, and has\r\nbeen checked by no one means so powerfully as by that paper. It is well\r\nand universally known, that it has been that paper which has checked the\r\ncareer of the monocrats; and the President, not sensible of the designs\r\nof the party, has not, with his usual good sense and _sang froid_,\r\nlooked on the efforts and effects of this free press, and seen that,\r\nthough some bad things have passed through it to the public, yet the\r\ngood have preponderated immensely.\r\n\r\n\r\nJune the 7th, 1793. Mr. Beckley, who has returned from New York within\r\na few days, tells me that, while he was there, Sir John Temple, Consul\r\nGeneral of the northern States for Great Britain showed him a letter\r\nfrom Sir Gregory Page Turner, a member of parliament for a borough in\r\nYorkshire, who, he said, had been a member for twenty-five years, and\r\nalways confidential for the ministers in which he permitted him to read\r\nparticular passages of the following purport: that the government was\r\nwell apprized of the predominancy of the British interest in the United\r\nStates; that they considered Colonel Hamilton, Mr. King, and Mr.\r\nSmith of South Carolina, as the main supports of that interest; that\r\nparticularly, they considered Colonel Hamilton, and not Mr. Hammond as\r\ntheir effective minister here; that if the anti-federal interest (that\r\nwas his term) at the head of which they considered Mr. Jefferson to be\r\nshould prevail, these gentlemen had secured an asylum to themselves\r\nin England.’ Beckley could not understand whether they had secured it\r\nthemselves* or whether they were only notified that it was secured\r\nto them. So that they understand that they may go on boldly in their\r\nmachinations to change the government, and if they should be overset\r\nand choose to withdraw, they will be secure of a pension in England, as\r\nArnold, Deane, &c. had. Sir John read passages of a letter (which he did\r\nnot put into Beckley’s hand, as he did the other) from Lord Grenville,\r\nsaying nearly the same things. This letter mentions Sir John, that\r\nthough they had divided the Consul-Generalship, and given the southern\r\ndepartment to Bond, yet he Sir John, was to retain his whole salary.\r\n[By this it would seem, as if, wanting to use Bond, they had covered his\r\nemployment with this cloak.] Mr. Beckley says that Sir John Temple is a\r\nstrong republican. I had a proof of his intimacy with Sir John in this\r\ncircumstance. Sir John received his new commission of Consul General for\r\nthe northern department, and, instead of sending it through Mr. Hammond,\r\ngot Beckley to enclose it to me for his exequatur I wrote to Sir John\r\nthat it must come through Mr Hammond enclosing it back to him. He\r\naccordingly then sent it to Mr. Hammond.\r\n\r\n     [* In the margin is written, by Mr. Jefferson; ‘Impossible\r\n     as to Hamilton; he was far above that.]\r\n\r\nIn conversation with the President to-day, and speaking about General\r\nGreene, he said that he and General Greene had always differed in\r\nopinion about the manner of using militia. Greene always placed them\r\nin his front: himself was of opinion, they should always be used as a\r\nreserve to improve any advantage, for which purpose they were the finest\r\nfellows in the world. He said he was on the ground of the battle of\r\nGuilford, with a person who was in the action, and who explained the\r\nwhole of it to him. That General Greene’s front was behind a fence at\r\nthe edge of a large field, through which the enemy were obliged to pass\r\nto get at them; and that, in their passage through this, they must have\r\nbeen torn all to pieces, if troops had been posted there who would have\r\nstood their ground; and that the retreat from that position was through\r\na thicket, perfectly secure. Instead of this he posted the North\r\nCarolina militia there who only gave one fire and fell back, so that the\r\nwhole benefit of their position was lost. He thinks that the regulars,\r\nwith their field-pieces, would have hardly let a single man get through\r\nthat field.\r\n\r\nEodem die (June the 7th). Beckley tells me that he has the following\r\nfact from Governor Clinton. That before the proposition for the present\r\nGeneral Government, i.e. a little before Hamilton conceived a plan for\r\nestablishing a monarchical government in the United States, he wrote\r\na draught of a circular letter, which was to be sent to about\r\n-------persons, to bring it about. One of these letters in Hamilton’s\r\nhand-writing, is now in possession of an old militia General up the\r\nNorth River, who, at that time, was thought orthodox enough to be\r\nentrusted in the execution. This General has given notice to Governor\r\nClinton, that he has this paper, and that he will deliver it into\r\nhis hands, and no one’s else. Clinton intends, the first interval of\r\nleisure, to go for it, and he will bring it to Philadelphia. Beckley is\r\na man of perfect truth as to what he affirms of his own knowledge, but\r\ntoo credulous as to what he hears from others.\r\n\r\n\r\nJune the 10th, 1793. Mr. Brown gives me the following specimen of\r\nthe phrenzy which prevailed at New York on the opening of the new\r\ngovernment. The first public ball which took place after the President’s\r\narrival there, Colonel Humphreys, Colonel W. S. Smith, and Mrs. Knox\r\nwere to arrange the ceremonials. These arrangements were as follows:\r\na sofa at the head of the room, raised on several steps whereon the\r\nPresident and Mrs. Washington were to be seated. The gentlemen were to\r\ndance in swords. Each one, when going to dance, was to lead his partner\r\nto the foot of the sofa, make a low obeisance to the President and his\r\nlady, then go and dance, and when done, bring his partner again to the\r\nfoot of the sofa for new obeisances, and then to retire to their chairs.\r\nIt was to be understood, too, that gentlemen should be dressed in bags.\r\nMrs. Knox contrived to come with the President, and to follow him and\r\nMrs. Washington to their destination, and she had the design of forcing\r\nan invitation from the President to a seat on the sofa. She mounted up\r\nthe steps after them unbidden, but unfortunately the wicked sofa was so\r\nshort, that when the President and Mrs. Washington were seated, there\r\nwas not room for a third person; she was obliged therefore to descend in\r\nthe face of the company, and to sit where she could. In other respects\r\nthe ceremony was conducted rigorously according to the arrangements, and\r\nthe President made to pass an evening which his good sense rendered a\r\nvery miserable one to him.\r\n\r\n\r\nJune the 12th. Beckley tells me that Klingham has been with him to-day,\r\nand relates to him the following fact. A certificate of the old Congress\r\nhad been offered at the treasury and refused payment and so endorsed in\r\nred ink as usual. This certificate came to the hands of Francis, (the\r\nquondam clerk of the treasury who, on account of his being dipped in\r\nthe infamous case of the Baron Glaubec, Hamilton had been obliged\r\nto dismiss, to save appearances, but with an assurance of all future\r\nservice, and he accordingly got him established in New York). Francis\r\nwrote to Hamilton that such a ticket was offered him, but he could not\r\nbuy it unless he would inform him and give him his certificate that it\r\nwas good. Hamilton wrote him a most friendly letter, and sent him\r\nthe certificate. He bought the paper, and came on here and got it\r\nrecognised, whereby he made twenty-five hundred dollars Klingham saw\r\nboth the letter and certificate.\r\n\r\nIrving, a clerk in the treasury, an Irishman, is the author of the\r\npieces now coming out under the signature of Verita’s and attacking the\r\nPresident. I have long suspected this detestable game was playing by the\r\nfiscal party, to place the President on their side.\r\n\r\nJuly the 18th, 1793. Lear calls on me. I told him that Irving, an\r\nIrishman, and a writer in the treasury, who, on a former occasion, had\r\ngiven the most decisive proofs of his devotion to his principal, was the\r\nauthor of the pieces signed Veritas: and I wished he could get at some\r\nof Irving’s acquaintances and inform himself of the fact, as the person\r\nwho told me of it would not permit the name of his informer to be\r\nmentioned. [Note. Beckley told me of it, and he had it from Swaine,\r\nthe printer to whom the pieces were delivered]; that I had long before\r\nsuspected this excessive foul play in that party of writing themselves\r\nin the character of the most exaggerated democrats and incorporating\r\nwith it a great deal of abuse on the President to make him believe it\r\nwas that party who were his enemies, and so throw him entirely into\r\nthe scale of the monocrats. Lear said he no longer ago than yesterday\r\nexpressed to the President his suspicions of the artifices of that party\r\nto work on him. He mentioned the following fact as a proof of their\r\nwriting in the character of their adversaries; to wit, the day after the\r\nlittle incident of Richet’s toasting ‘the man of the people’ (see the\r\ngazettes), Mrs. Washington was at Mrs. Powel’s, who mentioned to her\r\nthat, when the toast was given, there was a good deal of disapprobation\r\nappeared in the audience, and that many put on their hats and went out:\r\non inquiry, he had not found the fact true, and yet it was put into\r\n------‘s paper, and written under the character of a republican,\r\nthough he is satisfied it is altogether a slander of the monocrats.\r\nHe mentioned this to the President, but he did not mention to him the\r\nfollowing fact, which he knows; that in New York, the last summer, when\r\nthe parties of Jay and Clinton were running so high, it was an agreed\r\npoint with the former, that if any circumstances should ever bring it to\r\na question, whether to drop Hamilton or the President, they had decided\r\nto drop the President. He said that lately one of the loudest pretended\r\nfriends to the government, damned it, and said it was good for nothing,\r\nthat it could not support itself, and it was time to put it down and\r\nset up a better; and yet the same person, in speaking to the President,\r\npuffed off that party as the only friends to the government. He said\r\nhe really feared, that by their artifices and industry, they would\r\naggravate the President so much against the republicans, as to separate\r\nhim from the body of the people. I told him what the same cabals had\r\ndecided to do, if the President had refused his assent to the bank bill;\r\nalso what Brockhurst Livingston said to ------, that Hamilton’s life was\r\nmuch more precious to the community than the President’s.\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust the 1st. Met at the President’s, to consider what was to be\r\ndone with Mr. Genet. All his correspondence with me was read over.\r\nThe following propositions were made. 1. That a full statement of Mr.\r\nGenet’s conduct be made in a letter to G. Morris, and be sent with his\r\ncorrespondence, to be communicated to the Executive Council of France;\r\nthe letter to be so prepared, as to serve for the form of communication\r\nto the Council. Agreed unanimously. 2. That in that letter his recall be\r\nrequired. Agreed by all, though I expressed a preference of expressing\r\nthat desire with great delicacy; the others were for peremptory terms.\r\n3. To send him off. This was proposed by Knox; but rejected by every\r\nother. 4. To write a letter to Mr. Genet, the same in substance with\r\nthat written to G. Morris, and let him know we had applied for his\r\nrecall. I was against this, because I thought it would render him\r\nextremely active in his plans, and endanger confusion. But I was\r\noverruled by the other three gentlemen and the President. 5. That\r\na publication of the whole correspondence, and statement of the\r\nproceedings should be made by way of appeal to the people. Hamilton\r\nmade a jury speech of three quarters of an hour, as inflammatory and\r\ndeclamatory as if he had been speaking to a jury. E. Randolph opposed\r\nit. I chose to leave the contest between them. Adjourned to next day.\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust the 2nd. Met again. Hamilton spoke again three quarters of an\r\nhour. I answered on these topics. Object of the appeal. The democratic\r\nsociety; this the great circumstance of alarm; afraid it would extend\r\nits connections over the continent; chiefly meant for the local object\r\nof the ensuing election of Governor. If left alone, would die away after\r\nthat is over. If opposed, if proscribed, would give it importance and\r\nvigor; would give it a new object, and multitudes would join it merely\r\nto assert the right of voluntary associations. That the measure was\r\ncalculated to make the President assume the station of the head of a\r\nparty, instead of the head of the nation. Plan of the appeal. To consist\r\nof facts and the decisions of the President. As to facts we are agreed;\r\nbut as to the decisions, there have been great differences of opinion\r\namong us. Sometimes as many opinions as persons. This proves there will\r\nbe ground to attack the decision. Genet will appeal also; it will become\r\na contest between the President and Genet--anonymous writers--will be\r\nsame difference of opinion in public, as in our cabinet--will be\r\nsame difference in Congress, lot it must be laid before them--would,\r\ntherefore, work very unpleasantly at home. How would it work abroad?\r\nFrance--unkind--after such proofs of her friendship, should rely on\r\nthat friendship and her justice. Why appeal to the world? Friendly\r\nnations always negotiate little differences in private. Never appeal to\r\nthe world, but when they appeal to the sword. Confederacy of Pilnitz\r\nwas to overthrow the government of France. The interference of France\r\nto disturb other governments and excite insurrections, was a measure of\r\nreprisal. Yet these Princes have been able to make it believed to be the\r\nsystem of France. Colonel Hamilton supposes Mr. Genet’s proceedings\r\nhere are in pursuance of that system: and we are so to declare it to\r\nthe world, and to add our testimony to this base calumny of the Princes.\r\nWhat a triumph to them to be backed by our testimony. What a fatal\r\nstroke at the cause of liberty; _Et tu, Brute?_ We indispose the French\r\ngovernment, and they will retract their offer of the treaty of commerce.\r\nThe President manifestly inclined to the appeal to the people.* Knox, in\r\na foolish, incoherent sort of a speech, introduced the pasquinade lately\r\nprinted, called the funeral of George W--n and James W---n, King and\r\nJudge, &c, where the President was placed on a guillotine. The President\r\nwas much inflamed; got into one of those passions when he cannot command\r\nhimself; ran on much on the personal abuse which had been bestowed on\r\nhim; defied any man on earth to produce one single act of his since he\r\nhad been in the government, which was not done on the purest motives;\r\nthat he had never repented but once the having slipped the moment of\r\nresigning his office, and that was every moment since; that by God he\r\nhad rather be in his grave than in his present situation; that he had\r\nrather be on his farm than to be made Emperor of the world; and yet\r\nthat they were charging him with wanting to be a King. That that rascal\r\nFreneau sent him three of his papers every day, as if he thought he\r\nwould become the distributor of his papers; that he could see in this,\r\nnothing but an impudent design to insult him: he ended in this high\r\ntone. There was a pause. Some difficulty in resuming our question; it\r\nwas, however, after a little while, presented again, and he said there\r\nseemed to be no necessity for deciding it now; the propositions before\r\nagreed on might be put into a train of execution, and perhaps events\r\nwould show whether the appeal would be necessary or not. He desired we\r\nwould meet at my office the next day, to consider what should be done\r\nwith the vessels armed in our ports by Mr. Genet, and their prizes.\r\n\r\n     * He said that Mr. Morris, taking a family dinner with him\r\n     the other day, went largely, and of his own accord, into\r\n     this subject; advised this appeal, and promised, if the\r\n     President adopted it, that he would support it himself, and\r\n     engage for all his connections. The President repeated this\r\n     twice, and with an air of importance. Now Mr. Morris has no\r\n     family connections; he engaged then for his political\r\n     friends. This shows that the President has not confidence\r\n     enough in the virtue and good sense of mankind, to confide\r\n     in a government bottomed on them, and thinks other props\r\n     necessary.\r\n\r\nAugust the 3rd. We met. The President wrote to take our opinions,\r\nwhether Congress should be called. Knox pronounced at once against it.\r\nRandolph was against it. Hamilton said his judgment was against it, but\r\nthat if any two were for it, or against it, he would join them to make\r\na majority. I was for it. We agreed to give separate opinions to the\r\nPresident. Knox said we should have had fine work, if Congress had\r\nbeen sitting these two last months. The fool thus let out the secret.\r\nHamilton endeavored to patch up the indiscretion of this blabber, by\r\nsaying ‘he did not know; he rather thought they would have strengthened\r\nthe executive arm.’\r\n\r\nIt is evident they do not wish to lengthen the session of the next\r\nCongress, and probably they particularly wish it should not meet till\r\nGenet is gone. At this meeting I received a letter from Mr. Remsen at\r\nNew York, informing me of the event of the combat between the Ambuscade\r\nand the Boston. Knox broke out into the most unqualified abuse of\r\nCaptain Courtnay. Hamilton, with less fury, but with the deepest\r\nvexation, loaded him with censures. Both showed the most unequivocal\r\nmortification at the event.\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust the 6th, 1793. The President calls on me at my house in the\r\ncountry, and introduces my letter of July the 31st, announcing that I\r\nshould resign at the close of the next month. He again expressed his\r\nrepentance at not having resigned himself, and how much it was increased\r\nby seeing that he was to be deserted by those on whose aid he had\r\ncounted: that he did not know where he should look to find characters\r\nto fill up the offices; that mere talents did not suffice for the\r\ndepartment of State, but it required a person conversant in foreign\r\naffairs, perhaps acquainted with foreign courts; that without this, the\r\nbest talents would be awkward and at a loss. He told me that Colonel\r\nHamilton had three or four weeks ago written to him, informing him that\r\nprivate as well as public reasons had brought him to the determination\r\nto retire, and that he should do it towards the close of the next\r\nsession. He said he had often before intimated dispositions to resign,\r\nbut never as decisively before; that he supposed he had fixed on the\r\nlatter part of next session, to give an opportunity to Congress to\r\nexamine into his conduct: that our going out at times so different,\r\nincreased his difficulty; for if he had both places to fill at once, he\r\nmight consult both the particular talents and geographical situation\r\nof our successors. He expressed great apprehensions at the fermentation\r\nwhich seemed to be working in the mind of the public; that many\r\ndescriptions of persons, actuated by different causes, appeared to\r\nbe uniting; what it would end in he knew not; a new Congress was to\r\nassemble, more numerous, perhaps of a different spirit; the first\r\nexpressions of their sentiment would be important; if I would only stay\r\nto the end of that, it would relieve him considerably.\r\n\r\nI expressed to him my excessive repugnance to public life, the\r\nparticular uneasiness of my situation in this place, where the laws of\r\nsociety oblige me always to move exactly in the circle which I know to\r\nbear me peculiar hatred; that is to say, the wealthy aristocrats,\r\nthe merchants connected closely with England, the new created paper\r\nfortunes; that thus surrounded, my words were caught, multiplied,\r\nmisconstrued, and even fabricated and spread abroad to my injury; that\r\nhe saw also, that there was such an opposition of views between myself\r\nand another part of the administration, as to render it peculiarly\r\nunpleasing, and to destroy the necessary harmony. Without knowing\r\nthe views of what is called the republican party here, or having any\r\ncommunication with them, I could, undertake to assure him, from my\r\nintimacy with that party in the late Congress, that there was not a view\r\nin the republican party as spread over the United States, which went\r\nto the frame of the government; that I believed the next Congress would\r\nattempt nothing material, but to render their own body independent; that\r\nthat party were firm in their dispositions to support the government;\r\nthat the manoeuvres of Mr. Genet might produce some little\r\nembarrassment, but that he would be abandoned by the republicans the\r\nmoment they knew the nature of his conduct; and on the whole, no crisis\r\nexisted which threatened any thing.\r\n\r\nHe said, he believed the views of the republican party were perfectly\r\npure, but when men put a machine into motion, it is impossible for them\r\nto stop it exactly where they would choose, or to say where it will\r\nstop. That the constitution we have is an excellent one, if we can keep\r\nit where it is; that it was, indeed, supposed there was a party disposed\r\nto change it into a monarchical form, but that he could conscientiously\r\ndeclare there was not a man in the United States who would set his\r\nface more decidedly against it than himself. Here I interrupted him by\r\nsaying, ‘No rational man in the United States suspects you of any other\r\ndisposition; but there does not pass a week, in which we cannot prove\r\ndeclarations dropping from the monarchical party, that our government is\r\ngood for nothing, is a milk-and-water thing which cannot support itself,\r\nwe must knock it down, and set up something of more energy. He said, if\r\nthat was the case, he thought it a proof of their insanity, for that the\r\nrepublican spirit of the Union was so manifest and so solid, that it was\r\nastonishing how any one could expect to move it.\r\n\r\nHe returned to the difficulty of naming my successor; he said Mr.\r\nMadison would be his first choice, but that he had always expressed to\r\nhim such a decision against public office, that he could not expect he\r\nwould undertake it. Mr. Jay would prefer his present office. He said\r\nthat Mr. Jay had a great opinion of the talents of Mr. King; that there\r\nwas also Mr. Smith of South Carolina, and E. Rutledge: but he observed,\r\nthat, name whom he would, some objections would be made, some would be\r\ncalled speculators, some one thing, some another; and he asked me to\r\nmention any characters occurring to me. I asked him if Governor Johnson\r\nof Maryland had occurred to him. He said he had; that he was a man\r\nof great good sense, an honest man, and, he believed, clear of\r\nspeculations: but this, says he, is an instance of what I was observing;\r\nwith all these qualifications, Governor Johnson, from a want of\r\nfamiliarity with foreign affairs, would be in them like a fish out of\r\nwater; every thing would be new to him, and he awkward in every thing.\r\nI confessed to him that I had considered Johnson rather as fit for the\r\nTreasury department. ‘Yes,’ says he, ‘for that he would be the fittest\r\nappointment that could be made; he is a man acquainted with figures, and\r\nhaving as good a knowledge of the resources of this country as any man.’\r\nI asked him if Chancellor Livingston had occurred to him. He said yes;\r\nbut he was from New York, and to appoint him while Hamilton was in, and\r\nbefore it should be known he was going out, would excite a newspaper\r\nconflagration, as the ultimate arrangement would not be known. He said\r\nMcLurg had occurred to him as a man of first-rate abilities, but it is\r\nsaid that he is a speculator. He asked me what sort of a man Wolcot was.\r\nI told him I knew nothing of him myself; I had heard him characterized\r\nas a cunning man. I asked him whether some person could not take my\r\noffice per interim, till he should make an appointment; as Mr. Randolph,\r\nfor instance. ‘Yes,’ says he; ‘but there you would raise the expectation\r\nof keeping it, and I do not know that he is fit for it, nor what is\r\nthought of Mr. Randolph.’ I avoided noticing the last observation, and\r\nhe put the question to me directly. I then told him, I went into society\r\nso little as to be unable to answer it. I knew that the embarrassments\r\nin his private affairs had obliged him to use expedients, which had\r\ninjured him with the merchants and shop-keepers, and affected his\r\ncharacter of independence; that these embarrassments were serious, and\r\nnot likely to cease soon. He said, if I would only stay in till the end\r\nof another quarter (the last of December), it would get us through the\r\ndifficulties of this year, and he was satisfied that the affairs of\r\nEurope would be settled with this campaign: for that either France would\r\nbe overwhelmed by it, or the confederacy would give up the contest. By\r\nthat time, too, Congress will have manifested its character and views. I\r\ntold him that I had set my private affairs in motion in a line which\r\nhad powerfully called for my presence the last spring, and that they\r\nhad suffered immensely from my not going home; that I had now calculated\r\nthem to my return in the fall, and to fail in going then, would be\r\nthe loss of another year, and prejudicial beyond measure. I asked\r\nhim whether he could not name Governor Johnson to my office, under an\r\nexpress arrangement that at the close of the session he should take that\r\nof the Treasury. He said that men never chose to descend; that being\r\nonce in a higher department, he would not like to go into a lower one.\r\nHe asked me whether I could not arrange my affairs by going home. I told\r\nhim I did not think the public business would admit of it; that there\r\nnever was a day now, in which the absence of the Secretary of State\r\nwould not be inconvenient to the public. And he concluded by desiring\r\nthat I would take two or three days to consider whether I could not stay\r\nin till the end of another quarter, for that, like a man going, to the\r\ngallows, he was willing to put it off as long as he could; but if I\r\npersisted, he must then look about him and make up his mind to do the\r\nbest he could: and so he took leave.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovember the 5th, 1793. E. Randolph tells me, that Hamilton, in\r\nconversation with him yesterday, said, ‘Sir, if all the people in\r\nAmerica were now assembled, and to call on me to say whether I am a\r\nfriend to the French revolution, I would declare that I have it in\r\nabhorrence?’\r\n\r\n\r\nNovember the 8th, 1793. At a conference at the President’s, where I read\r\nseveral letters of Mr. Genet; on finishing one of them, I asked what\r\nshould be the answer. The President thereupon took occasion to observe,\r\nthat Mr. Genet’s conduct continued to be of so extraordinary a nature,\r\nthat he meant to propose to our serious consideration, whether he\r\nshould not have his functions discontinued, and be ordered away. He\r\nwent lengthily into observations on his conduct, to raise against the\r\nexecutive, 1. the people, 2. the State governments, 3. the Congress.\r\nHe showed he felt the venom of Genet’s pen, but declared he would not\r\nchoose his insolence should be regarded any farther, than as might be\r\nthought to affect the honor of the country. Hamilton and Knox readily\r\nand zealously argued for dismissing Mr. Genet. Randolph opposed it with\r\nfirmness, and pretty lengthily. The President replied to him lengthily,\r\nand concluded by saying he did not wish to have the thing hastily\r\ndecided, but that we should consider of it, and give our opinions on his\r\nreturn from Reading and Lancaster. Accordingly, November the 18th, we\r\nmet at his house; read new volumes of Genet’s letters, received since\r\nthe President’s departure; then took up the discussion of the subjects\r\nof communication to Congress. 1. The Proclamation. E. Randolph read the\r\nstatement he had prepared; Hamilton did not like it; said much about his\r\nown views; that the President had a right to declare his opinion to\r\nour citizens and foreign nations; that it was not the interest of this\r\ncountry to join in the war, and that we were under no obligation to join\r\nin it; that though the declaration would not legally bind Congress, yet\r\nthe President had a right to give his opinion of it, and he was against\r\nany explanation in the speech, which should yield that he did not intend\r\nthat foreign nations should consider it as a declaration of neutrality,\r\nfuture as well as present; that he understood it as meant to give them\r\nthat sort of assurance and satisfaction, and to say otherwise now,\r\nwould be a deception on them. He was for the President’s using\r\nsuch expressions, as should neither affirm his right to make such\r\na declaration to foreign nations, nor yield it. Randolph and myself\r\nopposed the right of the President to declare any thing future on the\r\nquestion, Shall there or shall there not be a war? and that no such\r\nthing was intended; that Hamilton’s construction of the effect of the\r\nproclamation would have been a determination of the question of the\r\nguarantee, which we both denied to have intended, and I had at the\r\ntime declared the executive incompetent to. Randolph said he meant that\r\nforeign nations should understand it as an intimation of the President’s\r\nopinion, that neutrality would be our interest. I declared my meaning to\r\nhave been, that foreign nations should understand no such thing; that,\r\non the contrary, I would have chosen them to be doubtful, and to come\r\nand bid for our neutrality. I admitted the President, having received\r\nthe nation at the close of Congress in a state of peace, was bound to\r\npreserve them in that state till Congress should meet again, and might\r\nproclaim any thing which went no farther. The President declared he\r\nnever had an idea that he could bind Congress against declaring war, or\r\nthat any thing contained in his proclamation could look beyond the first\r\nday of their meeting. His main view was to keep our people in peace;\r\nhe apologized for the use of the term neutrality in his answers,\r\nand justified it, by having submitted the first of them (that to the\r\nmerchants, wherein it was used) to our consideration, and we had not\r\nobjected to the term. He concluded in the end, that Colonel Hamilton\r\nshould prepare a paragraph on this subject for the speech, and it should\r\nthen be considered. We were here called to dinner.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, the _renvoi_ of Genet was proposed by himself. I opposed\r\nit on these topics. France, the only nation on earth sincerely our\r\nfriend. The measure so harsh a one, that no precedent is produced\r\nwhere it has not been followed by war. Our messenger has now been gone\r\neighty-four days; consequently, we may hourly expect the return, and\r\nto be relieved by their revocation of him. Were it now resolved on, it\r\nwould be eight or ten days before the matter on which the order should\r\nbe founded, could be selected, arranged, discussed, and forwarded. This\r\nwould bring us within four or five days of the meeting of Congress.\r\nWould it not be better to wait and see how the pulse of that body, new\r\nas it is, would beat. They are with us now, probably, but such a step as\r\nthis may carry many over to Genet’s side. Genet will not obey the\r\norder, &c. &c. The President asked me what I would do if Genet sent the\r\naccusation to us to be communicated to Congress, as he threatened in the\r\nletter to Moultrie. I said I would not send it to Congress; but either\r\nput it in the newspapers, or send it back to him to be published if he\r\npleased. Other questions and answers were put and returned in a quicker\r\naltercation than I ever before saw the President use. Hamilton was for\r\nthe _renvoi_; spoke much of the dignity of the nation; that they were\r\nnow to form their character; that our conduct now would tempt or deter\r\nother foreign ministers from treating us in the same manner; touched on\r\nthe President’s personal feelings; did not believe France would make it\r\na cause of war; if she did, we ought to do what was right, and meet the\r\nconsequences, &c. Knox on the same side, and said he thought it very\r\npossible Mr. Genet would either declare us a department of France, or\r\nlevy troops here and endeavor to reduce us to obedience. Randolph of my\r\nopinion, and argued chiefly on the resurrection of popularity to Genet,\r\nwhich might be produced by this measure. That at present he was dead in\r\nthe public opinion, if we would but leave him so. The President lamented\r\nthere was not unanimity among us; that as it was, we had left him\r\nexactly where we found him; and so it ended.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovember the 21st. We met at the President’s. The manner of explaining\r\nto Congress the intentions of the proclamation, was the matter of\r\ndebate. Randolph produced his way of stating it. This expressed its\r\nviews to have been, 1. to keep our citizens quiet; 2. to intimate to\r\nforeign nations that it was the President’s opinion, that the interests\r\nand dispositions of this country were for peace. Hamilton produced his\r\nstatement, in which he declared his intention to be, to say nothing\r\nwhich could be laid hold of for any purpose; to leave the proclamation\r\nto explain itself. He entered pretty fully into all the argumentation\r\nof Pacificus; he justified the right of the President to declare his\r\nopinion for a future neutrality, and that there existed no circumstances\r\nto oblige the United States to enter into the war on account of the\r\nguarantee; and that in agreeing to the proclamation, he meant it to be\r\nunderstood as conveying both those declarations; viz. neutrality, and\r\nthat the _casus foederis_ on the guarantee did not exist. He admitted\r\nthe Congress might declare war, notwithstanding these declarations of\r\nthe President. In like manner, they might declare war in the face of a\r\ntreaty, and in direct infraction of it. Among other positions laid down\r\nby him, this was with great positiveness; that the constitution having\r\ngiven power to the President and Senate to make treaties, they might\r\nmake a treaty of neutrality which should take from Congress the right to\r\ndeclare war in that particular case, and that under the form of a treaty\r\nthey might exercise any powers whatever, even those exclusively given by\r\nthe constitution to the House of Representatives. Randolph opposed this\r\nposition, and seemed to think that where they undertook to do acts by\r\ntreaty (as to settle a tariff of duties), which were exclusively given\r\nto the legislature, that an act of the legislature would be necessary\r\nto confirm them, as happens in England, when a treaty interferes with\r\nduties established by law. I insisted that in giving to the President\r\nand Senate a power to make treaties, the constitution meant only to\r\nauthorize them to carry into effect, by way of treaty, any powers they\r\nmight constitutionally exercise. I was sensible of the weak points in\r\nthis position, but there were still weaker in the other hypothesis; and\r\nif it be impossible to discover a rational measure of authority to have\r\nbeen given by this clause, I would rather suppose that the cases\r\nwhich my hypothesis would leave unprovided, were not thought of by the\r\nconvention, or if thought of, could not be agreed on, or were thought\r\nof and deemed unnecessary to be invested in the government. Of this\r\nlast description, were treaties of neutrality, treaties offensive and\r\ndefensive, &c. In every event, I would rather construe so narrowly as\r\nto oblige the nation to amend, and thus declare what powers they would\r\nagree to yield, than too broadly, and, indeed, so broadly as to enable\r\nthe executive and Senate to do things which the constitution forbids.\r\nOn the question, which form of explaining the principles of the\r\nproclamation should be adopted, I declared for Randolph’s, though it\r\ngave to that instrument more objects than I had contemplated. Knox\r\ndeclared for Hamilton’s. The President said he had had but one\r\nobject, the keeping our people quiet till Congress should meet; that\r\nnevertheless, to declare he did not mean a declaration of neutrality,\r\nin the technical sense of the phrase, might perhaps be crying _peccavi_\r\nbefore he was charged. However, he did not decide between the two\r\ndraughts.\r\n\r\nNovember the 23rd. At the President’s. Present, Knox, Randolph, and Th:\r\nJefferson. Subject, the heads of the speech. One was, a proposition to\r\nCongress to fortify the principal harbors. I opposed the expediency\r\nof the General Government’s undertaking it, and the expediency of the\r\nPresident’s proposing it. It was amended, by substituting a proposition\r\nto adopt means for enforcing respect to the jurisdiction of the United\r\nStates within its waters. It was proposed to recommend the establishment\r\nof a military academy. I objected that none of the specified powers\r\ngiven by the constitution to Congress, would authorize this. It was,\r\ntherefore, referred for further consideration and inquiry. Knox was for\r\nboth propositions. Randolph against the former, but said nothing as to\r\nthe latter. The President acknowledged he had doubted of the expediency\r\nof undertaking the former; and as to the latter, though it would be a\r\ngood thing, he did not wish to bring on any thing which might generate\r\nheat and ill-humor. It was agreed that Randolph should draw the speech\r\nand the messages.\r\n\r\nNovember the 28th. Met at the President’s. I read over a list of the\r\npapers copying, to be communicated to Congress on the subject of Mr.\r\nGenet. It was agreed that Genet’s letter of August the 13th to the\r\nPresident, mine of August the 16th, and Genet’s of November to myself\r\nand the Attorney General, desiring a prosecution of Jay and King,\r\nshould not be sent to the legislature: on a general opinion, that the\r\ndiscussion of the fact certified by Jay and King had better be left to\r\nthe channel of the newspapers, and in the private hands in which it now\r\nis, than for the President to meddle in it, or give room to a discussion\r\nof it in Congress.\r\n\r\nRandolph had prepared a draught of the speech. The clause recommending\r\nfortifications was left out; but that for a military academy was\r\ninserted. I opposed it, as unauthorized by the constitution. Hamilton\r\nand Knox approved it without discussion. Randolph was for it, saying\r\nthat the words of the constitution anthorizing Congress to lay taxes,\r\n&c. for the common defence, might comprehend it. The President said he\r\nwould not choose to recommend any thing against the constitution, but if\r\nit was doubtful, he was so impressed with the necessity of this measure,\r\nthat he would refer it to Congress, and let them decide for themselves\r\nwhether the constitution authorized it or not. It was, therefore,\r\nleft in. I was happy to see that Randolph had, by accident, used the\r\nexpression ‘our republic,’ in the speech. The President, however, made\r\nno objection to it, and so, as much as it had disconcerted him on\r\na former occasion with me, it was now put into his own mouth to be\r\npronounced to the two Houses of legislature.\r\n\r\nNo material alterations were proposed or made in any part of the\r\ndraught.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, I produced the draught of messages on the subject of\r\nFrance and England, proposing that that relative to Spain should be\r\nsubsequent and secret.\r\n\r\nHamilton objected to the draught in toto; said that the contrast drawn\r\nbetween the conduct of France and England amounted to a declaration of\r\nwar; he denied that France had ever done us favors; that it was mean for\r\na nation to acknowledge favors; that the dispositions of the people of\r\nthis country towards France, he considered as a serious calamity; that\r\nthe executive ought not, by an echo of this language, to nourish that\r\ndisposition in the people; that the offers in commerce made us by\r\nFrance, were the offspring of the moment, of circumstances which would\r\nnot last, and it was wrong to receive as permanent, things merely\r\ntemporary; that he could demonstrate that Great Britain showed us\r\nmore favors than France. In complaisance to him I whittled down the\r\nexpressions without opposition; struck out that of ‘favors ancient and\r\nrecent’ from France; softened some terms, and omitted some sentiments\r\nrespecting Great Britain. He still was against the whole, but insisted\r\nthat, at any rate, it should be a secret communication, because the\r\nmatters it stated were still depending. These were, 1. the inexecution\r\nof the treaty; 2. the restraining our commerce to their own ports and\r\nthose of their friends. Knox joined Hamilton in every thing. Randolph\r\nwas for the communications; that the documents respecting the first\r\nshould be given in as public; but that those respecting the second\r\nshould not be given to the legislature at all, but kept secret. I began\r\nto tremble now for the whole, lest all should be kept secret. I urged,\r\nespecially, the duty now incumbent on the President, to lay before the\r\nlegislature and the public what had passed on the inexecution of the\r\ntreaty, since Mr. Hammond’s answer of this month might be considered\r\nas the last we should ever have; that, therefore, it could no longer\r\nbe considered as a negotiation pending. I urged that the documents\r\nrespecting the stopping our corn ought also to go, but insisted that if\r\nit should be thought better to withhold them, the restrictions should\r\nnot go to those respecting the treaty; that neither of these subjects\r\nwas more in a state of pendency than the recall of Mr. Genet, on which,\r\nnevertheless, no scruples had been expressed. The President took up\r\nthe subject with more vehemence than I have seen him show, and decided\r\nwithout reserve, that not only what had passed on the inexecution of the\r\ntreaty should go in as public (in which Hamilton and Knox had divided\r\nin opinion from Randolph and myself), but also that those respecting the\r\nstopping our corn should go in as public (wherein Hamilton, Knox, and\r\nRandolph had been against me.) This was the first instance I had seen of\r\nhis deciding on the opinion of one against that of three others, which\r\nproved his own to have been very strong.\r\n\r\n\r\nDecember the 1st, 1793. Beckley tells me he had the following fact from\r\nLear. Langdon, Cabot, and some others of the Senate, standing in a knot\r\nbefore the fire after the Senate had adjourned, and growling together\r\nabout some measure which they had just lost; ‘Ah!’ said Cabot,\r\n‘things will never go right till you have a President for life, and an\r\nhereditary Senate.’ Langdon told this to Lear, who mentioned it to the\r\nPresident. The President seemed struck with it, and declared he had not\r\nsupposed there was a man in the United States who could have entertained\r\nsuch an idea.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch the 2nd, 1797. I arrived at Philadelphia to qualify as\r\nVice-President, and called instantly on Mr. Adams, who lodged at\r\nFrancis’s, in Fourth street. The next morning he returned my visit\r\nat Mr. Madison’s, where I lodged. He found me alone in my room, and\r\nshutting the door himself, he said he was glad to find me alone, for\r\nthat he wished a free conversation with me. He entered immediately on an\r\nexplanation of the situation of our affairs with France, and the\r\ndanger of rupture with that nation, a rupture which would convulse the\r\nattachments of this country; that he was impressed with the necessity of\r\nan immediate mission to the Directory; that it would have been the first\r\nwish of his heart to have got me to go there, but that he supposed it\r\nwas out of the question, as it did not seem justifiable for him to\r\nsend away the person destined to take his place in case of accident to\r\nhimself, nor decent to remove from competition one who was a rival in\r\nthe public favor. That he had, therefore, concluded to send a mission,\r\nwhich, by its dignity, should satisfy France, and by its selection from\r\nthe three great divisions of the continent, should satisfy all parts of\r\nthe United States; in short, that he had determined to join Gerry and\r\nMadison to Pinckney, and he wished me to consult Mr. Madison for him.\r\nI told him that, as to myself, I concurred in the opinion of\r\nthe impropriety of my leaving the post assigned me, and that my\r\ninclinations, moreover, would never permit me to cross the Atlantic\r\nagain; that I would, as he desired, consult Mr. Madison, but I feared\r\nit was desperate, as he had refused that mission on my leaving it, in\r\nGeneral Washington’s time, though it was kept open a twelvemonth for\r\nhim. He said that if Mr. Madison should refuse, he would still appoint\r\nhim, and leave the responsibility on him. I consulted Mr. Madison, who\r\ndeclined, as I expected. I think it was on Monday the 6th of March, Mr.\r\nAdams and myself met at dinner at General Washington’s, and we happened,\r\nin the evening, to rise from table and come away together. As soon as\r\nwe got into the street, I told him the event of my negotiation with Mr.\r\nMadison. He immediately said, that, on consultation, some objections to\r\nthat nomination had been raised, which he had not contemplated; and was\r\ngoing on with excuses which evidently embarrassed him, when we came to\r\nFifth street, where our road separated, his being down Market street,\r\nmine off along Fifth, and we took leave: and he never after that said\r\none word to me on the subject, or ever consulted me as to any measures\r\nof the government. The opinion I formed at the time on this transaction\r\nwas, that Mr. Adams, in the first moments of the enthusiasm of the\r\noccasion (his inauguration), forgot party sentiments, and, as he never\r\nacted on any system, but was always governed by the feeling of the\r\nmoment, he thought, for a moment, to steer impartially between the\r\nparties; that Monday, the 6th of March, being the first time he had\r\nmet his cabinet, on expressing ideas of this kind, he had been at once\r\ndiverted from them, and returned to his former party views.\r\n\r\n\r\nJuly, 1797. Murray is rewarded for his services by an appointment to\r\nAmsterdam; W. Smith of Charleston, to Lisbon.\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust the 24th. About the time of the British treaty, Hamilton and\r\nTalleyrand, bishop of Autun, dined together, and Hamilton drank freely.\r\nConversing on the treaty, Talleyrand says, ‘_Mais vraiment, Monsieur\r\nHamilton, ce n’est pas Men honnete_, after making the Senate ratify\r\nthe treaty, to advise the President to reject it.’ ‘The treaty,’ says\r\nHamilton, ‘is an execrable one, and Jay was an old woman for making\r\nit; but the whole credit of saving us from it must be given to the\r\nPresident.’ After circumstances had led to a conclusion that the\r\nPresident also must ratify it, he said to the same Talleyrand, ‘Though\r\nthe treaty is a most execrable one, yet when once we have come to a\r\ndetermination on it, we must carry it through thick and thin, right or\r\nwrong.’ Talleyrand told this to Volney, who told it to me.\r\n\r\nThere is a letter now appearing in the papers, from Pickering to Monroe,\r\ndated July the 24th, 1797, which I am satisfied is written by Hamilton.\r\nHe was in Philadelphia at that date.\r\n\r\n\r\nDecember the 26th, 1797. Langdon tells me, that at the second election\r\nof President and Vice-President of the United States, when there was a\r\nconsiderable vote given to Clinton in opposition to Mr. Adams, he took\r\noccasion to remark it in conversation in the Senate chamber with Mr.\r\nAdams, who gritting his teeth, said, ‘Damn ‘em, damn ‘em, damn ‘em, you\r\nsee that an elective government will not do.’ He also tells me that Mr.\r\nAdams, in a late conversation,said,’ Republicanism must be disgraced,\r\n‘Sir.’ The Chevalier Yrujo called on him at Braintree, and conversing on\r\nFrench affairs, and Yrujo expressing his belief of their stability, in\r\nopposition to Mr. Adamses, the latter lifting up and shaking his finger\r\nat him, said, ‘I’ll tell you what, the French republic will not last\r\nthree months.’ This I had from Yrujo.\r\n\r\nHarper, lately in a large company, was saying that the best thing the\r\nfriends of the French could do, was to pray for the restoration of\r\ntheir monarch. ‘Then,’ says a by-stander, ‘the best thing we could do,\r\nI suppose, would be to pray for the establishment of a monarch in the\r\nUnited States.’ ‘Qur people,’ says Harper, ‘are not yet ripe for it, but\r\nit is the best thing we can come to, and we shall come to it.’ Something\r\nlike this was said in presence of Findlay. He now denies it in the\r\npublic papers, though it can be proved by several members.\r\n\r\n\r\nDecember the 27th. Tench Coxe tells me, that a little before Hamilton\r\nwent out of office, or just as he was going out, taking with him his\r\nlast conversation, and among other things, on the subject of their\r\ndifferences, ‘For my part,’ says he, ‘I avow myself a monarchist; I have\r\nno objection to a trial being made of this thing of a republic, but,’\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary the 5th, 1798. I receive a very remarkable fact indeed, in\r\nour history, from Baldwin and Skinner. Before the establishment of our\r\npresent government, a very extensive combination had taken place in New\r\nYork and the eastern States, among that description of people who were\r\npartly monarchical in principle, or frightened with Shays’s rebellion\r\nand the impotence of the old Congress. Delegates in different places had\r\nactually had consultations on the subject of seizing on the powers of\r\na government, and establishing them by force; had corresponded with\r\none another, and had sent a deputy to General Washington to solicit his\r\nco-operation. He refused to join them. The new convention was in the\r\nmean time proposed by Virginia and appointed. These people believed it\r\nimpossible the States should ever agree on a government, as this must\r\ninclude the impost and all the other powers which the States had, a\r\nthousand times, refused to the general authority. They therefore let the\r\nproposed convention go on, not doubting its failure, and confiding\r\nthat on its failure would be a still more favorable moment for their\r\nenterprise. They therefore wished it to fail, and especially, when\r\nHamilton, their leader, brought forward his plan of government, failed\r\nentirely in carrying it, and retired in disgust from the convention.\r\nHis associates then took every method to prevent any form of government\r\nbeing agreed to. But the well-intentioned never ceased trying, first one\r\nthing, then another, till they could get something agreed to. The final\r\npassage and adoption of the constitution completely defeated the\r\nviews of the combination, and saved us from an attempt to establish a\r\ngovernment over us by force. This fact throws a blaze of light on the\r\nconduct of several members from New York and the eastern States in the\r\nconvention of Annapolis, and the grand convention. At that of Annapolis,\r\nseveral eastern members most vehemently opposed Madison’s proposition\r\nfor a more general convention, with more general powers. They wished\r\nthings to get more and more into confusion, to justify the violent\r\nmeasure they proposed. The idea of establishing a government by\r\nreasoning and agreement, they publicly ridiculed as an Utopian project,\r\nvisionary and unexampled.\r\n\r\n\r\nFebruary the 6th, 1798. Mr. Baldwin tells me, that in a conversation\r\nyesterday with Goodhue, on the state of our affairs, Goodhue said, ‘I’ll\r\ntell you what, I have made up my mind on this subject; I would rather\r\nthe old ship should go down than not’; (meaning the Union of the\r\nStates.) Mr. Hillhouse coming up, ‘Well,’ says Mr. Baldwin, ‘I’ll tell\r\nmy old friend Hillhouse what you say ‘; and he told him. ‘Well,’ says\r\nGoodhue, ‘I repeat, that I would rather the old ship should go down,\r\nif we are to be always kept pumping so.’ ‘Mr. Hillhouse,’ says Baldwin,\r\n‘you remember when we were learning logic together at school, there was\r\nthe case categorical and the case hypothetical. Mr. Goodhue stated it to\r\nme first as the case categorical. I am glad to see that he now changes\r\nit to the case hypothetical, by adding, ‘if we are always to be kept\r\npumping so.’ Baldwin went on then to remind Goodhue what an advocate he\r\nhad been for our tonnage duty, wanting to make it one dollar instead\r\nof fifty cents; and how impatiently he bore the delays of Congress\r\nin proceeding to retaliate on Great Britain before Mr. Madison’s\r\npropositions came on. Goodhue acknowledged that his opinions had changed\r\nsince that.\r\n\r\n\r\nFebruary the 15th, 1798. I dined this day with Mr. Adams, (the\r\nPresident.) The company was large. After dinner I was sitting next to\r\nhim, and our conversation was first on the enormous price of labor,*\r\nhouse rent, and other things. We both concurred in ascribing it\r\nchiefly to the flood of bank paper now afloat, and in condemning those\r\ninstitutions. We then got on the constitution; and in the course of our\r\nconversation he said, that no republic could ever last which had not a\r\nSenate, and a Senate deeply and strongly rooted, strong enough to bear\r\nup against all popular storms and passions; that he thought our\r\nSenate as well constituted as it could have been, being chosen by the\r\nlegislatures; for if these could not support them, he did not know what\r\ncould do it; that perhaps it might have been as well for them to\r\nbe chosen by the State at large, as that would insure a choice of\r\ndistinguished men, since none but such could be known to a whole people;\r\nthat the only fault in our Senate was, that it was not durable enough;\r\nthat hitherto, it had behaved very well; however, he was afraid they\r\nwould give way in the end. That as to trusting to a popular assembly for\r\nthe preservation of our liberties, it was the merest chimera imaginable;\r\nthey never had any rule of decision but their own will; that he would\r\nas lieve be again in the hands of our old committees of safety, who made\r\nthe law and executed it at the same time; that it had been observed by\r\nsome writer (I forget whom he named), that anarchy did more mischief in\r\none night, than tyranny in an age; and that in modern times we might say\r\nwith truth, that, in France, anarchy had done more harm in one night,\r\nthan all the despotism of their Kings had ever done in twenty or thirty\r\nyears. The point in which he views our Senate, as the colossus of the\r\nconstitution, serves as a key to the politics of the Senate, who are\r\ntwo thirds of them in his sentiments, and accounts for the bold line of\r\nconduct they pursue.\r\n\r\n     * He observed, that eight or ten years ago he gave only\r\n     fifty dollars to a common laborer for his farm, finding him\r\n     food and lodging. Now he gives one hundred and fifty\r\n     dollars, and even two hundred dollars to one.\r\n\r\nMarch the 1st. Mr. Tazewell tells me, that when the appropriations for\r\nthe British treaty were on the carpet, and very uncertain in the lower\r\nHouse, there being at that time a number of bills in the hands of\r\ncommittees of the Senate, none reported, and the Senate idle for want\r\nof them, he, in his place, called on the committees to report, and\r\nparticularly on Mr. King, who was of most of them. King said that it was\r\ntrue the committees kept back their reports, waiting the event of\r\nthe question about appropriation: that if that was not carried, they\r\nconsidered legislation as at an end; that they might as well break up\r\nand consider the Union as dissolved. Tazewell expressed his astonishment\r\nat these ideas, and called on King to know if he had misapprehended him.\r\nKing rose again and repeated the same words. The next day, Cabot took\r\nan occasion in debate, and so awkward a one as to show it was a thing\r\nagreed to be done, to repeat the same sentiments in stronger terms, and\r\ncarried further, by declaring a determination on their side to break up\r\nand dissolve the government.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch the 11th. In conversation with Baldwin and Brown of Kentucky,\r\nBrown says that in a private company once, consisting of Hamilton, King,\r\nMadison, himself, and some one else making a fifth, speaking of the\r\n‘federal government’; ‘Oh!’ says Hamilton, ‘say the federal monarchy;\r\nlet us call things by their right names, for a monarchy it is.’\r\n\r\nBaldwin mentions at table the following fact. When the bank bill was\r\nunder discussion in the House of Representatives, Judge Wilson came in,\r\nand was standing by Baldwin. Baldwin reminded him of the following fact\r\nwhich passed in the grand convention. Among the enumerated powers given\r\nto Congress, was one to erect corporations. It was on debate struck\r\nout. Several particular powers were then proposed. Among others, Robert\r\nMorris proposed to give Congress a power to establish a national bank.\r\nGouverneur Morris opposed it, observing that it was extremely doubtful\r\nwhether the constitution they were framing could ever be passed at all\r\nby the people of America; that to give it its best chance, however, they\r\nshould make it as palatable as possible and put nothing into it not\r\nvery essential, which might raise up enemies; that his colleague (Robert\r\nMorris) well knew that ‘a bank’ was, in their State (Pennsylvania)\r\nthe very watch-word of party; that a bank had been the great bone of\r\ncontention between the two parties of the State, from the establishment\r\nof their constitution, having been erected, put down, and erected again,\r\nas either party preponderated; that therefore, to insert this power,\r\nwould instantly enlist against the whole instrument, the whole of the\r\nanti-bank party in Pennsylvania. Whereupon it was rejected, as was every\r\nother special power, except that of giving copyrights to authors, and\r\npatents to inventors; the general power of incorporating being whittled\r\ndown to this shred. Wilson agreed to the fact.\r\n\r\nMr. Hunter of South Carolina, who lodges with Rutledge, [* J. Rutledge,\r\njunior] tells me, that Rutledge was explaining to him the plan they\r\nproposed to pursue as to war measures, when Otis came in. Rutledge\r\naddressed Otis. ‘Now, Sir,’ says he, ‘you must come forward with\r\nsomething liberal for the southern States, fortify their harbors and\r\nbuild galleys, in order to obtain their concurrence.’ Otis said, ‘We\r\ninsist on convoys for our European trade, and _guarda-costas_, on which\r\ncondition alone, we will give them galleys and fortifications.’ Rutledge\r\nobserved, that in the event of war, McHenry and Pickering must go out;\r\nWolcott, he thought, might remain, but the others were incapable of\r\nconducting a war. Otis said the eastern people would never abandon\r\nPickering; he must be retained; McHenry might go. They considered\r\ntogether whether General Pinckney would accept the office of\r\nSecretary of War. They apprehended he would not. It was agreed in this\r\nconversation, that Sewall had more the ear of the President than any\r\nother person.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch the 12th. When the bill for appropriations was before the\r\nSenate, Anderson moved to strike out a clause recognising (by way\r\nof appropriation) the appointment of a committee by the House of\r\nRepresentatives, to sit during their recess to collect evidence on\r\nBlount’s case, denying they had power, but by a law, to authorize a\r\ncommittee to sit during recess. Tracy advocated the motion, and said,\r\n‘We may as well speak out. The committee was appointed by the House of\r\nRepresentatives, to take care of the British minister, to take care of\r\nthe Spanish minister, to take care of the Secretary of State, in short,\r\nto take care of the President of the United States. They were afraid\r\nthe President and Secretary of State would not perform the office of\r\ncollecting evidence faithfully; that there would be collusion, &c.\r\nTherefore, the House appointed a committee of their own. We shall have\r\nthem next sending a committee to Europe to make a treaty, &c. Suppose\r\nthat the House of Representatives should resolve, that after the\r\nadjournment of Congress, they should continue to sit as a committee of\r\nthe whole House during the whole recess.’ This shows how the appointment\r\nof that committee has been viewed by the President’s friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nApril the 5th. Doctor Rush tells me he had it from Mrs. Adams, that\r\nnot a scrip of a pen has passed between the late and present President,\r\nsince he came into office.\r\n\r\n\r\nApril the 13th. New instructions of the British government to their\r\narmed ships now appear, which clearly infringe their treaty with us,\r\nby authorizing them to take our vessels carrying produce of the French\r\ncolonies from those colonies to Europe, and to lake vessels bound to\r\na blockaded port. See them in Brown’s paper, of April the 18th, in due\r\nform.\r\n\r\nThe President has sent a government brig to France, probably to carry\r\ndespatches. He has chosen as the bearer of these, one Humphreys, the son\r\nof a ship-carpenter, ignorant, under age, not speaking a word of French,\r\nmost abusive of that nation; whose only merit is, the having mobbed and\r\nbeaten Bache on board the frigate built here, for which he was indicted\r\nand punished by fine.\r\n\r\n\r\nApril the 25th. At a dinner given by the bar to the federal judges,\r\nChase and Peters, present about twenty-four lawyers, and William\r\nTilghman in the chair, this toast was given; ‘Our _King_ in old\r\nEngland.’ Observe the double entendre on the word King. Du Ponceau,\r\nwho was one of the bar present, told this to Tench Coxe, who told me\r\nin presence of H. Tazewell. Dallas was at the dinner; so was Colonel\r\nCharles Sims of Alexandria, who is here on a law-suit vs. General\r\nIrving.\r\n\r\n\r\nMay the 3rd. The President some time ago appointed Steele, of Virginia,\r\na commissioner to the Indians, and recently Secretary of the Mississippi\r\nTerritory. Steele was a Counsellor of Virginia, and was voted out by the\r\nAssembly because he turned tory. He then offered for Congress, and was\r\nrejected by the people. Then offered for the Senate of Virginia, and was\r\nrejected. The President has also appointed Joseph Hopkinson commissioner\r\nto make a treaty with the Oneida Indians. He is a youth of about\r\ntwenty-two or twenty-three, and has no other claims to such an\r\nappointment than extreme toryism, and the having made a poor song to the\r\ntune of the President’s March.\r\n\r\n\r\nOctober the 13th, 1798. Littlepage, who has been on one or two missions\r\nfrom Poland to Spain, said that when Gardoqui returned from America,\r\nhe settled with his court an account of secret service money, of six\r\nhundred thousand dollars. _Ex relatione_ Colonel Monroe.\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1799. In a conversation between Doctor Ewen and the President,\r\nthe former said one of his sons was an aristocrat, the other a democrat.\r\nThe President asked if it were not the youngest who was the democrat.\r\n‘Yes,’ said Ewen. ‘Well,’ said the President, ‘a boy of fifteen who\r\nis not a democrat is good for nothing, and he is no better who is a\r\ndemocrat at twenty.’ Ewen told Hurt, and Hurt told me.\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary the 14th. Logan tells me that in his conversation with Pickering\r\non his arrival, the latter abused Gerry very much; said he was a traitor\r\nto his country, and had deserted the post to which he was appointed;\r\nthat the French temporized at first with Pinckney, but found him too\r\nmuch of a man for their purpose. Logan observing, that, notwithstanding\r\nthe pacific declarations of France, it might still be well to keep up.\r\nthe military ardor of our citizens, and to have the militia in good\r\norder: ‘The militia,’ said Pickering, ‘the militia never did any good to\r\nthis country, except in the single affair of Bunker’s Hill; that we must\r\nhave a standing army of fifty thousand men, which being stationed in\r\ndifferent parts of the continent, might serve as rallying points for the\r\nmilitia, and so render them of some service.’ In his conversation with\r\nMr. Adams, Logan mentioned the willingness of the French to treat with\r\nGerry. ‘And do you know why,’ said Mr. Adams. ‘Why, Sir?’ said\r\nLogan. ‘Because,’ said Mr. Adams, ‘they know him to have been an\r\nanti-federalist, against the constitution.’\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary the 2nd, 1800. Information from Tench Coxe. Mr. Liston had sent\r\ntwo letters to the Governor of Canada by one Sweezy. He had sent copies\r\nof them, together with a third, (original) by one Cribs. Sweezy was\r\narrested (being an old horse-thief), and his papers examined. T. Coxe\r\nhad a sight of them. As soon as a rumor got out that there were letters\r\nof Mr. Liston disclosed, but no particulars yet mentioned, Mr. Liston\r\nsuspecting that Cribs had betrayed him, thought it best to bring all\r\nhis three letters, and lay them before Pickering, Secretary of State.\r\nPickering thought them all very innocent. In his office they were seen\r\nby Mr. Hodgen of New Jersey, commissary of military stores, and the\r\nintimate friend of Pickering. It happens that there is some land\r\npartnership between Pickering, Hodgen, and Coxe, so that the latter is\r\nfreely and intimately visited by Hodgen, who, moreover, speaks freely\r\nwith him on political subjects. They were talking the news of the day,\r\nwhen Mr. Coxe observed that these intercepted letters of Liston were\r\nserious things; (nothing being yet out but a general rumor.) Hodgen\r\nasked which he thought the most serious. Coxe said the second; (for he\r\nknew yet of no other.) Hodgen said he thought little of any of them, but\r\nthat the third was the most exceptionable. This struck Coxe, who, not\r\nbetraying his ignorance of a third letter, asked generally what part of\r\nthat he alluded to. Hodgen said to that wherein he assured the Governor\r\nof Canada, that if the French invaded Canada, an army would be marched\r\nfrom these States to his assistance. After this it became known that it\r\nwas Sweezy who was arrested, and not Cribs; so that Mr. Liston had made\r\nan unnecessary disclosure of his third letter to Mr. Pickering, who,\r\nhowever, keeps his secret for him. In the beginning of the conversation\r\nbetween Hodgen and Coxe, Coxe happened to name Sweezy as the bearer of\r\nthe letters. ‘That ‘s not his name,’ says Hodgen, (for he did not know\r\nthat two of the letters had been sent by Sweezy also) ‘his name is\r\nCribs.’ This put Coxe on his guard, and set him to fishing for the new\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary the 10th. Doctor Rush tells me, that he had it from Samuel\r\nLyman, that during the X. Y. Z. Congress, the federal members held the\r\nlargest caucus they have ever had, at which he was present, and the\r\nquestion was proposed and debated, whether they should declare war\r\nagainst France, and determined in the negative. Lyman was against it. He\r\ntells me, that Mr. Adams told him, that when he came on in the fall to\r\nTrenton, he was there surrounded constantly by the opponents of the late\r\nmission to France. That Hamilton pressing him to delay it, said, ‘Why,\r\nSir, by Christmas, Louis the XVIII. will be seated on his throne.’ Mr.\r\nA. ‘By whom?’ H. ‘By the coalition.’ Mr. A. ‘Ah! then farewell to the\r\nindependence of Europe. If a coalition, moved by the finger of England,\r\nis to give a government to France, there is an end to the independence\r\nof every country.’\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary the 12th. General Samuel Smith says that Pickering, Wolcott,\r\nand McHenry, wrote a joint letter from Trenton to the President, then at\r\nBraintree, dissuading him from the mission to France. Stoddard refused\r\nto join it. Stoddard says the instructions are such, that if the\r\nDirectory have any disposition to reconciliation, a treaty will be made.\r\nHe observed to him also, that Ellsworth looks beyond this mission to\r\nthe Presidential chair. That with this view, he will endeavor to make\r\na treaty, and a good one. That Davie has the same vanity and views. All\r\nthis communicated by Stoddard to S. Smith.\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary the 13th. Baer and Harrison G. Otis told J. Nicholas, that in\r\nthe caucus mentioned ante 10th, there wanted but five votes to produce a\r\ndeclaration of war. Baer was against it.\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary the 19th. W. C. Nicholas tells me, that in a conversation with\r\nDexter three or four days ago, he asked Dexter whether it would not be\r\npracticable for the States to agree on some uniform mode of choosing\r\nelectors of President. Dexter said, ‘I suppose you would prefer an\r\nelection by districts.’ ‘Yes,’ said Nicholas, ‘I think it would be\r\nbest; but would nevertheless agree to any other consistent with the\r\nconstitution.’ Dexter said he did not know what might be the opinion of\r\nhis State, but his own was, that no mode of election would answer any\r\ngood purpose; that he should prefer one for life. ‘On that reasoning,’\r\nsaid Nicholas, ‘you should prefer an hereditary one.’ ‘No,’ he said, ‘we\r\nare not ripe for that yet. I suppose,’ added he, ‘this doctrine is not\r\nvery popular with you.’ ‘No,’ said Nicholas, ‘it would effectually damn\r\nany man in my State.’ ‘So it would in mine,’ said Dexter; ‘but I am\r\nunder no inducement to belie my sentiment; I have nothing to ask from\r\nany body; I had rather be at home than here, therefore I speak my\r\nsentiments freely.’ Mr. Nicholas, a little before or after this, made\r\nthe same proposition of a uniform election to Rossr who replied that he\r\nsaw no good in any kind of election. ‘Perhaps,’ said he, ‘the present\r\none may last a while.’ On the whole, Mr. Nicholas thinks he perceives,\r\nin that party, a willingness and a wish to let every thing go from bad\r\nto worse, to amend nothing, in hopes it may bring on confusion, and open\r\na door to the kind of government they wish. In a conversation with Gunn,\r\nwho goes with them, but thinks in some degree with us, Gunn told him\r\nthat the very game which the minority of Pennsylvania is now playing\r\nwith McKean (see substitute of minority in lower House, and address\r\nof Senate in upper), was meditated by the same party in the federal\r\ngovernment, in case of the election of a republican President; and that\r\nthe eastern States would in that case throw things into confusion,\r\nand break the Union. That they have in a great degree got rid of their\r\npaper, so as no longer to be creditors, and the moment they cease to\r\nenjoy the plunder of the immense appropriations now exclusively theirs,\r\nthey would aim at some other order of things.\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary the 24th. Mr. Smith, a merchant of Hamburg, gives me the\r\nfollowing information. The St. Andrew’s Club, of New York, (all\r\nof Scotch tories,) gave a public dinner lately. Among other guests\r\nAlexander Hamilton was one. After dinner, the first toast was ‘The\r\nPresident of the United States.’ It was drunk without any particular\r\napprobation. The next was, ‘George the Third.’ Hamilton started up on\r\nhis feet, and insisted on a bumper and three cheers. The whole company\r\naccordingly rose and gave the cheers. One of them, though a federalist,\r\nwas so disgusted at the partiality shown by Hamilton to a foreign\r\nsovereign over his own President, that he mentioned it to a Mr.\r\nSchwart-house, an American merchant of New York, who mentioned it to\r\nSmith.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith also tells me, that calling one evening on Mr. Evans, then\r\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives of Pennsylvania, and asking\r\nthe news, Evans said, Harper had just been there, and speaking of the\r\nPresident’s setting out to Braintree, said, ‘he prayed to God that his\r\nhorses might run away with him, or some other accident happen to break\r\nhis neck before he reached Braintree.’ This was in indignation at his\r\nhaving named Murray, &c. to negotiate with France. Evans approved of the\r\nwish.\r\n\r\n\r\nFebruary the 1st. Doctor Rush tells me that he had it from Asa Green,\r\nthat when the clergy addressed General Washington on his departure\r\nfrom the government, it was observed in their consultation, that he had\r\nnever, on any occasion, said a word to the public which showed a belief\r\nin the Christian religion, and they thought they should so pen their\r\naddress, as to force him at length to declare publicly whether he was a\r\nChristian or not. They did so. However, he observed, the old fox was\r\ntoo cunning for them. He answered every article of their address\r\nparticularly except that, which he passed over without notice. Rush\r\nobserves, he never did say a word on the subject in any of his public\r\npapers, except in his valedictory letter to the Governors of the States\r\nwhen he resigned his commission in the army, wherein he speaks of ‘the\r\nbenign influence of the Christian religion.’\r\n\r\nI know that Gouverneur Morris, who pretended to be in his secrets and\r\nbelieved himself to be so, has often told me that General Washington\r\nbelieved no more of that system than he himself did.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch, 1800. Heretical doctrines maintained in Senate, on the motion\r\nagainst the Aurora. That there is in every legal body of men a right of\r\nself-preservation, authorizing them to do whatever is necessary for that\r\npurpose: by Tracy, Read, and Lawrence. That the common law authorizes\r\nthe proceeding proposed against the Aurora, and is in force here: by\r\nRead. That the privileges of Congress are and ought to be indefinite: by\r\nRead.\r\n\r\nTracy says, he would not say exactly that the common law of England in\r\nall its extent is in force here; but common sense reason, and morality,\r\nwhich are the foundations of the common law, are in force here, and\r\nestablish a common law. He held himself so nearly half way between the\r\ncommon law of England and what every body else has called natural law,\r\nand not common law, that he could hold to either the one or the other,\r\nas he should find expedient.\r\n\r\nDexter maintained that the common law, as to crimes, is in force in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nChipman says, that the principles of common right are common law.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch the 11th. Conversing with Mrs. Adams on the subject of the writers\r\nin the newspapers, I took occasion to mention that I never in my life\r\nhad, directly or indirectly, written one sentence for a newspaper; which\r\nis an absolute truth. She said that Mr. Adams, she believed, had pretty\r\nwell ceased to meddle in the newspapers, since he closed the pieces on\r\nDavila. This is the first direct avowal of that work to be his, though\r\nlong and universally understood to be so.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch the 14th. Freneau, in Charleston, had the printing of the laws\r\nin his paper. He printed a pamphlet of Pinckney’s letters on Robbins’s\r\ncase. Pickering has given the printing of the laws to the tory paper of\r\nthat place, though not of half the circulation. The printing amounted to\r\nabout one hundred dollars a year.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch the 24th. Mr. Perez Morton of Massachusetts tells me that\r\nThatcher, on his return from the war Congress, declared to him he had\r\nbeen for a declaration of war against France, and many others also; but\r\nthat on counting noses they found they could not carry it, and therefore\r\ndid not attempt it.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch the 27th. Judge Breckenridge gives me the following information.\r\nHe and Mr. Ross were originally very intimate; indeed, he says, he found\r\nhim keeping a little Latin school, and advised and aided him in the\r\nstudy of the law, and brought him forward. After Ross became a Senator,\r\nand particularly at the time of the western insurrection, they still\r\nwere in concert. After the British treaty, Ross, on his return, informed\r\nhim there was a party in the United States who wanted to overturn the\r\ngovernment, who were in league with France; that France, by a secret\r\narticle of treaty with Spain, was to have Louisiana; and that Great\r\nBritain was likely to be our best friend and dependence.\r\n\r\nOn this information, he, Breckenridge, was induced to become an advocate\r\nfor the British treaty. During this intimacy with Ross, he says, that\r\nGeneral Collot, in his journey to the western country, called on\r\nhim, and he frequently led Breckenridge into conversations on\r\ntheir grievances under the government, and particularly the western\r\nexpedition; that he spoke to him of the advantages that country would\r\nhave in joining France when she should hold Louisiana; showed him a map\r\nhe had drawn of that part of the country; pointed out the passes in the\r\nmountain, and the facility with which they might hold them against\r\nthe United States, and with which France could support them from New\r\nOrleans. He says, that in these conversations, Collot let himself out\r\nwithout common prudence. He says, Michaux (to whom I, at the request of\r\nGenet, had given a letter of introduction to the Governor of Kentucky as\r\na botanist, which was his real profession,) called on him; that Michaux\r\nhad a commissary’s commission for the expedition, which Genet had\r\nplanned from that quarter against the Spaniards; that ----------,\r\nthe late Spanish commandant of St. Genevieve, with one Powers, an\r\nEnglishman, called on him. That from all these circumstances, together\r\nwith Ross’s stories, he did believe that there was a conspiracy to\r\ndeliver our country, or some part of it at least, to the French; that he\r\nmade notes of what passed between himself and Collot and the others, and\r\nlent them to Mr. Ross, who gave them to the President, by whom they were\r\ndeposited in the office of the Board of War; that when he complained\r\nto Ross of this breach of confidence, he endeavored to get off by\r\ncompliments on the utility and importance of his notes. They now cooled\r\ntowards each other; and his opposition to Ross’s election as Governor\r\nhas separated them in truth, though not entirely to appearance.\r\n\r\nDoctor Rush tells me, that within a few days he has heard a member\r\nof Congress lament our separation from Great Britain, and express his\r\nsincere wishes that we were again dependent on her.\r\n\r\n\r\nDecember the 25th, 1800. Colonel Hitchburn tells me what Colonel Monroe\r\nhad before told me of, as coming from Hitchburn. He was giving me the\r\ncharacters of persons in Massachusetts. Speaking of Lowell, he said he\r\nwas, in the beginning of the Revolution, a timid whig, but as soon as he\r\nfound we were likely to prevail, he became a great office-hunter. And in\r\nthe very breath of speaking of Lowell, he stopped: says he, I will give\r\nyou a piece of information which I do not venture to speak of to others.\r\nThere was a Mr. Hale in Massachusetts, a reputable, worthy man, who\r\nbecoming a little embarrassed in his affairs, I aided him, which\r\nmade him very friendly to me. He went to Canada on some business. The\r\nGovernor there took great notice of him. On his return, he took occasion\r\nto mention to me that he was authorized by the Governor of Canada\r\nto give from three to five thousand guineas each to himself and some\r\nothers, to induce them not to do any thing to the injury of their\r\ncountry, but to befriend a good connection between England and it.\r\nHitchburn said he would think of it, and asked Hale to come and dine\r\nwith him to-morrow. After dinner he drew Hale fully out. He told him he\r\nhad his doubts, but particularly, that he should not like to be alone in\r\nsuch a business. On that, Hale named to him four others who were to\r\nbe engaged, two of whom, said Hitchburn, are now dead, and two living.\r\nHitchburn, when he had got all he wanted out of Hale, declined in a\r\nfriendly way. But he observed those, four men, from that moment, to\r\nespouse the interests of England in every point and on every occasion.\r\nThough he did not name the men to me, yet as the speaking of Lowell was\r\nwhat brought into his Read to tell me this anecdote, I concluded he was\r\none. From other circumstances respecting Stephen Higginson, of whom he\r\nspoke, I conjectured him to be the other living one.\r\n\r\n\r\nDecember the 26th. In another conversation, I mentioned to Colonel\r\nHitchburn, that though he had not named names, I had strongly suspected\r\nHigginson to be one of Hale’s men. He smiled and said, if I had strongly\r\nsuspected any man wrongfully from his information, he would undeceive\r\nme: that there were no persons he thought more strongly to be suspected\r\nhimself, than Higginson and Lowell. I considered this as saying they\r\nwere the men. Higginson is employed in an important business about our\r\nnavy.\r\n\r\n\r\nFebruary the 12th, 1801. Edward Livingston tells me, that Bayard applied\r\nto-day or last night to General Samuel Smith, and represented to him\r\nthe expediency of his coming over to the States who vote for Burr, that\r\nthere was nothing in the way of appointment which he might not command,\r\nand particularly mentioned the Secretaryship of the Navy. Smith asked\r\nhim if he was authorized to make the offer. He said he was authorized.\r\nSmith told this to Livingston, and to W. C. Nicholas, who confirms it\r\nto me. Bayard in like manner tempted Livingston, not by offering\r\nany particular office, but by representing to him his (Livingston’s)\r\nintimacy and connection with Burr; that from him he had every thing to\r\nexpect, if he would come over to him. To Doctor Linn of New Jersey, they\r\nhave offered the government of New Jersey. See a paragraph in Martin’s\r\nBaltimore paper of February the 10th, signed, ‘a looker on,’ staling an\r\nintimacy of views between Harper and Burr.\r\n\r\n\r\nFebruary the 14th. General Armstrong tells me, that Gouverneur Morris,\r\nin conversation with him to-day on the scene which is passing, expressed\r\nhimself thus. ‘How comes it,’ says he, ‘that Burr, who is four hundred\r\nmiles off (at Albany), has agents here at work with great activity,\r\nwhile Mr. Jefferson, who is on the spot, does nothing?’ This explains\r\nthe ambiguous conduct of himself and his nephew, Lewis Morris, and that\r\nthey were holding themselves free for a price; i.e. some office, either\r\nto the uncle or nephew.\r\n\r\n\r\nFebruary the 16th. See in the Wilmington Mirror of February the 14th,\r\nMr. Bayard’s elaborate argument to prove that the common law, as\r\nmodified by the laws of the respective States at the epoch of the\r\nratification of the constitution, attached to the courts of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\r\nJune the 23rd, 1801. Andrew Ellicot tells me, that in a conversation\r\nlast summer with Major William Jackson of Philadelphia, on the subject\r\nof our intercourse with Spain, Jackson said we had managed our affairs\r\nbadly; that he himself was the author of the papers against the Spanish\r\nminister signed Americanus; that his object was irritation; that he was\r\nanxious, if it could have been brought, about, to have plunged us into a\r\nwar with Spain, that the people might have been occupied with that, and\r\nnot with the conduct of the administration, and other things they had no\r\nbusiness to meddle with.\r\n\r\n\r\nDecember the 13th, 1803. The Reverend Mr. Coffin of New England, who\r\nis now here soliciting donations for a college in Greene county, in\r\nTennessee, tells me that when he first determined to engage in this\r\nenterprise, he wrote a paper recommendatory of the enterprise, which\r\nhe meant to get signed by clergymen, and a similar one for persons in\r\na civil character, at the head of which he wished Mr. Adams to put his\r\nname, he being then President, and the application going only for his\r\nname, and not for a donation. Mr. Adams, after reading the paper and\r\nconsidering, said, ‘he saw no possibility of continuing the union of\r\nthe States; that their dissolution must necessarily take place; that he\r\ntherefore saw no propriety in recommending to New England men to promote\r\na literary institution in the south; that it was in fact giving strength\r\nto those who were to be their enemies, and therefore, he would have\r\nnothing to do with it.’\r\n\r\nDecember the 31st. After dinner to-day, the pamphlet on the conduct of\r\nColonel Burr being the subject of conversation, Matthew Lyon noticed\r\nthe insinuations against the republicans at Washington, pending the\r\nPresidential election, and expressed his wish that every thing was\r\nspoken out which was known; that it would then appear on which side\r\nthere was a bidding for votes, and he declared that John Brown of Rhode\r\nIsland, urging him to vote for Colonel Burr, used these words. ‘What is\r\nit you want, Colonel Lyon? Is it office, is it money? Only say what you\r\nwant, and you shall have it.’\r\n\r\nJanuary the 2nd, 1804. Colonel Hitchburn, of Massachusetts, reminding\r\nme of a letter he had written me from Philadelphia, pending the\r\nPresidential election, says he did not therein give the details. That he\r\nwas in company at Philadelphia with Colonel Burr and ------ that in the\r\ncourse of the conversation on the election, Colonel Burr said, ‘We must\r\nhave a President, and a constitutional one, in some way.’ ‘How is it to\r\nbe done,’ says Hitchburn; ‘Mr. Jefferson’s friends will not quit him,\r\nand his enemies are not strong enough to carry another.’ ‘Why,’ says\r\nBurr, ‘our friends must join the federalists, and give the President.’\r\n‘The next morning at breakfast, Colonel Burr repeated nearly the same,\r\nsaying, ‘We cannot be without a President, our friends must join the\r\nfederal vote.’ ‘But,’ says Hitchburn, ‘we shall then be without a\r\nVice-President; who is to be our Vice-President?’ Colonel Burr answered,\r\n‘Mr. Jefferson.’\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary the 26th. Colonel Burr, the Vice-President, calls on me in the\r\nevening, having previously asked an opportunity of conversing with me.\r\nHe began by recapitulating summarily, that he had come to New York a\r\nstranger, some years ago; that he found the country in possession of two\r\nrich families (the Livingstons and Clintons); that his pursuits were not\r\npolitical, and he meddled not. When the crisis, however, of 1800 came\r\non, they found their influence worn out, and solicited his aid with the\r\npeople. He lent it without any views of promotion. That his being named\r\nas a candidate for Vice-President was unexpected by him. He acceded to\r\nit with a view to promote my fame and advancement, and from a desire to\r\nbe with me, whose company and conversation had always been fascinating\r\nto him. That, since, those great families had become hostile to him,\r\nand had excited the calumnies which I had seen published. That in this\r\nHamilton had joined, and had even written some of the pieces against\r\nhim. That his attachment to me had been sincere, and was still\r\nunchanged, although many little stories had been carried to him, and\r\nhe supposed to me also, which he despised; but that attachments must be\r\nreciprocal, or cease to exist, and therefore he asked if any change\r\nhad taken place in mine towards him; that he had chosen to have this\r\nconversation with myself directly, and not through any intermediate\r\nagent. He reminded me of a letter written to him about the time of\r\ncounting the votes (say February, 1801), mentioning that his election\r\nhad left a chasm in my arrangements; that I had lost him from my list\r\nin the administration, &c. He observed, he believed it would be for\r\nthe interest of the republican cause for him to retire; that a\r\ndisadvantageous schism would otherwise take place; but that were he to\r\nretire, it would be said he shrunk from the public sentence, which he\r\nnever would do; that his enemies were using my name to destroy him,\r\nand something was necessary from me to prevent and deprive them of that\r\nweapon, some mark of favor from me which would declare to the world that\r\nhe retired with my confidence.\r\n\r\nI answered by recapitulating to him what had been my conduct previous\r\nto the election of 1800. That I had never interfered directly or\r\nindirectly, with my friends or any others, to influence the election\r\neither for him or myself; that I considered it as my duty to be merely\r\npassive, except that in Virginia I had taken some measures to procure\r\nfor him the unanimous vote of that State, because I thought any failure\r\nthere might be imputed to me. That in the election now coming on, I was\r\nobserving the same conduct, held no councils with any body respecting\r\nit, nor suffered any one to speak to me on the subject, believing it my\r\nduty to leave myself to the free discussion of the public; that I do\r\nnot at this moment know, nor have ever heard, who were to be proposed\r\nas candidates for the public choice, except so far as could be gathered\r\nfrom the newspapers. That as to the attack excited against him in the\r\nnewspapers, I had noticed it but as the passing wind; that I had seen\r\ncomplaints that Cheetham, employed in publishing the laws, should be\r\npermitted to eat the public bread and abuse its second officer: that as\r\nto this, the publishers of the laws were appointed by the Secretary of\r\nState, without any reference to me; that to make the notice general, it\r\nwas often given to one republican and one federal printer of the same\r\nplace; that these federal printers did not in the least intermit their\r\nabuse of me, though receiving emoluments from the government, and that\r\nI have never thought it proper to interfere for myself, and consequently\r\nnot in the case of the Vice-President. That as to the letter he referred\r\nto, I remembered it, and believed he had only mistaken the date at which\r\nit was written; that I thought it must have been on the first notice of\r\nthe event of the election of South Carolina; and that I had taken that\r\noccasion to mention to him, that I had intended to have proposed to\r\nhim one of the great offices, if he had not been elected; but that his\r\nelection, in giving him a higher station, had deprived me of his aid in\r\nthe administration. The letter alluded to was, in fact, mine to him of\r\nDecember the 15th, 1800. I now went on to explain to him verbally,\r\nwhat I meant by saying I had lost him from my list. That in General\r\nWashington’s time, it had been signified to him that Mr. Adams, the\r\nVice-President, would be glad of a foreign embassy; that General\r\nWashington mentioned it to me, expressed his doubts whether Mr. Adams\r\nwas a fit character for such an office, and his still greater doubts,\r\nindeed, his conviction, that it would not be justifiable to send away\r\nthe person who, in case of his death, was provided by the constitution\r\nto take his place: that it would moreover appear indecent for him to be\r\ndisposing of the public trusts, in apparently buying off a competitor\r\nfor the public favor. I concurred with him in the opinion, and, if I\r\nrecollect rightly, Hamilton, Knox, and Randolph were consulted, and gave\r\nthe same opinions. That when Mr. Adams came to the administration, in\r\nhis first interview with me, he mentioned the necessity of a mission to\r\nFrance, and how desirable it would have been to him if he could have got\r\nme to undertake it; but that he conceived it would be wrong in him to\r\nsend me away, and assigned the same reasons General Washington had done;\r\nand therefore, he should appoint Mr. Madison, &c. That I had myself\r\ncontemplated his (Colonel Burr’s) appointment to one of the great\r\noffices, in case he was not elected Vice-President; but that as soon\r\nas that election was known, I saw it could not be done, for the good\r\nreasons which had led General Washington and Mr. Adams to the same\r\nconclusion; and therefore, in my first letter to Colonel Burr, after the\r\nissue was known, I had mentioned to him that a chasm in my arrangements\r\nhad been produced by this event. I was thus particular in rectifying the\r\ndate of this letter, because it gave me an opportunity of explaining the\r\ngrounds on which it was written, which were, indirectly, an answer to\r\nhis present hints. He left the matter with me for consideration, and the\r\nconversation was turned to indifferent subjects. I should here notice,\r\nthat Colonel Burr must have thought I could swallow strong things in\r\nmy own favor, when he founded his acquiescence to the nomination as\r\nVice-President, to his desire of promoting my honor, the being with me,\r\nwhose company and conversation had always been fascinating with him, &c.\r\nI had never seen Colonel Burr till he came as a member of Senate. His\r\nconduct very soon inspired me with distrust. I habitually cautioned\r\nMr. Madison against trusting him too much. I saw afterwards, that under\r\nGeneral Washington’s and Mr. Adams’s administrations, whenever a great\r\nmilitary appointment or a diplomatic one was to be made, he came post to\r\nPhiladelphia to show himself, and in fact that he was always at market,\r\nif they had wanted him. He was indeed told by Dayton in 1800, he\r\nmight be Secretary at War; but this bid was too late! His election as\r\nVice-President was then foreseen. With these impressions of Colonel\r\nBurr, there never had been an intimacy between us, and but little\r\nassociation. When I destined him for a high appointment, it was out of\r\nrespect for the favor he had obtained with the republican party, by his\r\nextraordinary exertions and success in the New York election in 1800.\r\n\r\n\r\nApril the 15th, 1806. About a month ago, Colonel Burr called on me, and\r\nentered into a conversation, in which he mentioned, that a little before\r\nmy coming into office, I had written to him a letter intimating that I\r\nhad destined him for a high employ, had he not been placed by the people\r\nin a different one; that he had signified his willingness to resign as\r\nVice-President, to give aid to the administration in any other place;\r\nthat he had never asked an office, however; he asked aid of nobody, but\r\ncould walk on his own legs and take care of himself; that I had always\r\nused him with politeness, but nothing more; that he aided in bringing on\r\nthe present order of things; that he had supported the administration;\r\nand that he could do me much harm: he wished, however, to be\r\non different ground: he was now disengaged from all particular\r\nbusiness--willing to engage in something--should be in town some days,\r\nif I should have any thing to propose to him. I observed to him, that\r\nI had always been sensible that he possessed talents which might be\r\nemployed greatly to the advantage of the public, and that, as to myself,\r\nI had a confidence that if he were employed, he would use his talents\r\nfor the public good: but that he must be sensible the public had\r\nwithdrawn their confidence from him, and that in a government like ours\r\nit was necessary to embrace in its administration as great a mass of\r\npublic confidence as possible, by employing those who had a character\r\nwith the public, of their own, and not merely a secondary one through\r\nthe executive. He observed, that if we believed a few newspapers, it\r\nmight be supposed he had lost the public confidence, but that I knew how\r\neasy it was to engage newspapers in any thing. I observed, that I\r\ndid not refer to that kind of evidence of his having lost the public\r\nconfidence, but to the late Presidential election, when, though in\r\npossession of the office of Vice-President, there was not a single voice\r\nheard for his retaining it. That as to any harm he could do me, I knew\r\nno cause why he should desire it, but, at the same time, I feared no\r\ninjury which any man could do me: that I never had done a single act,\r\nor been concerned in any transaction, which I feared to have fully laid\r\nopen, or which could do me any hurt, if truly stated: that I had never\r\ndone a single thing with a view to my personal interest, or that of any\r\nfriend, or with any other view than that of the greatest public good:\r\nthat, therefore, no threat or fear on that head would ever be a motive\r\nof action with me. He has continued in town to this time; dined with me\r\nthis day week, and called on me to take leave two or three days ago.\r\n\r\nI did not commit these things to writing at the time, but I do it now,\r\nbecause in a suit between him and Cheetham, he has had a deposition of\r\nMr. Bayard taken, which seems to have no relation to the suit, nor\r\nto any other object than to calumniate me. Bayard pretends to have\r\naddressed to me, during the pending of the Presidential election in\r\nFebruary, 1801, through General Samuel Smith, certain conditions on\r\nwhich my election might be obtained, and that General Smith, after\r\nconversing with me, gave answers from me. This is absolutely false. No\r\nproposition of any kind was ever made to me on that occasion by General\r\nSmith, nor any answer authorized by me. And this fact General Smith\r\naffirms at this moment.\r\n\r\nFor some matters connected with this, see my notes of February the 12th\r\nand 14th, 1801, made at the moment. But the following transactions\r\ntook place about the same time, that is to say, while the Presidential\r\nelection was in suspense in Congress, which, though I did not enter at\r\nthe time, they made such an impression on my mind, that they are now\r\nas fresh, as to their principal circumstances, as if they had happened\r\nyesterday. Coming out of the Senate chamber one day, I found Gouverneur\r\nMorris on the steps. He stopped me, and began a conversation on the\r\nstrange and portentous state of things then existing, and went on to\r\nobserve, that the reasons why the minority of States was so opposed to\r\nmy being elected, were, that they apprehended that, 1. I would turn all\r\nfederalists out of office; 2. put down the navy; 3. wipe off the public\r\ndebt. That I need only to declare, or authorize my friends to declare,\r\nthat I would not take these steps, and instantly the event of the\r\nelection would be fixed. I told him, that I should leave the world\r\nto judge of the course I meant to pursue, by that which I had pursued\r\nhitherto, believing it to be my duty to be passive and silent during the\r\npresent scene; that I should certainly make no terms; should never go\r\ninto the office of President by capitulation, nor with my hands tied by\r\nany conditions which should hinder me from pursuing the measures which\r\nI should deem for the public good. It was understood that Gouverneur\r\nMorris had entirely the direction of the vote of Lewis Morris of\r\nVermont, who, by coming over to Matthew Lyon, would have added another\r\nvote, and decided the election. About the same time, I called on Mr.\r\nAdams. We conversed on the state of things. I observed to him, that\r\na very dangerous experiment was then in contemplation, to defeat the\r\nPresidential election by an act of Congress declaring the right of\r\nthe Senate to name a President of the Senate, to devolve on him the\r\ngovernment during any interregnum: that such a measure would probably\r\nproduce resistance by force, and incalculable consequences, which it\r\nwould be in his power to prevent by negativing such an act. He seemed to\r\nthink such an act justifiable, and observed, it was in my power to fix\r\nthe election by a word in an instant, by declaring I would not turn out\r\nthe federal officers, nor put down the navy, nor spunge the national\r\ndebt. Finding his mind made up as to the usurpation of the government by\r\nthe President of the Senate, I urged it no further, observed, the\r\nworld must judge as to myself of the future by the past, and turned the\r\nconversation to something else. About the same time, Dwight Foster of\r\nMassachusetts called on me in my room one night, and went into a very\r\nlong conversation on the state of affairs, the drift of which was to let\r\nme understand, that the fears above mentioned were the only obstacle to\r\nmy election, to all of which I avoided giving any answer the one way\r\nor the other. From this moment he became most bitterly and personally\r\nopposed to me, and so has ever continued. I do not recollect that I\r\never had any particular conversation with General Samuel Smith on this\r\nsubject. Very possibly I had, however, as the general subject and\r\nall its parts were the constant themes of conversation in the private\r\ntête-à-têtes with our friends. But certain I am, that neither he nor\r\nany other republican ever uttered the most distant hint to me about\r\nsubmitting to any conditions, or giving any assurances to any body;\r\nand still more certainly, was neither he nor any other person ever\r\nauthorized by me to say what I would or would not do.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following official opinion, though inadvertently omitted in its\r\nproper place, is deemed of sufficient importance to be inserted here.]\r\n\r\nThe bill for establishing a National Bank, undertakes, among other\r\nthings,\r\n\r\n1. To form the subscribers into a corporation.\r\n\r\n2. To enable them, in their corporate capacities, to receive grants of\r\nland; and so far, is against the laws of _Mortmain_.*\r\n\r\n     * Though the constitution controls the laws of Mortmain, so\r\n     far as to permit Congress itself to hold lands for certain\r\n     purposes, yet not so far as to permit them to communicate a\r\n     similar right to other corporate bodies.\r\n\r\n3. To make alien subscribers capable of holding lands; and so far, is\r\nagainst the laws of Alienage.\r\n\r\n4. To transmit these lands, on the death of a proprietor, to a certain\r\nline of successors; and so far, changes the course of Descents.\r\n\r\n5. To put the lands out of the reach of forfeiture or escheat; and so\r\nfar, is against the laws of _Forfeiture_ and _Escheat_.\r\n\r\n6. To transmit personal chattels to successors in a certain line; and so\r\nfar, is against the laws of Distribution.\r\n\r\n7. To give them the sole and exclusive right of banking under the\r\nnational authority; and so far, is against the laws of Monopoly.\r\n\r\n8. To communicate to them a power to make laws paramount to the laws of\r\nthe States; for so they must be construed, to protect the institution\r\nfrom the control of the State legislatures; and so, probably, they will\r\nbe construed.\r\n\r\nI consider the foundation of the constitution as laid on this ground,\r\nthat all powers not delegated to the United States by the constitution\r\nnor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States or to\r\nthe people.’ (Twelfth amendment.) To take a single step beyond the\r\nboundaries thus specially drawn around the powers of Congress, is to\r\ntake possession of a boundless field of power, no longer susceptible of\r\nany definition.\r\n\r\nThe incorporation of a bank, and the powers assumed by this bill,\r\nhave not, in my opinion, been delegated to the United States by the\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nI. They are not among the powers specially, enumerated. For these are,\r\n\r\n1. A power to _lay taxes_ for the purpose of paying the debts of the\r\nUnited States. But no debt is paid by this bill, nor any tax laid. Were\r\nit a bill to raise money, its origination in the Senate would condemn it\r\nby the constitution.\r\n\r\n2. To ‘borrow money.’ But this bill neither borrows money, nor insures\r\nthe borrowing it. The proprietors of the bank will be just as free\r\nas any other money-holders, to lend or not to lend their money to the\r\npublic. The operation proposed in the bill, first to lend them two\r\nmillions, and then borrow them back again cannot change the nature of\r\nthe latter act, which will still be a payment and not a loan, call it by\r\nwhat name you please.\r\n\r\n3. ‘To regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the States, and\r\nwith the Indian tribes.’ To erect a bank, and to regulate commerce, are\r\nvery different acts. He who erects a bank creates a subject of commerce\r\nin its bills: so does he who makes a bushel of wheat, or digs a dollar\r\nout of the mines. Yet neither of these persons regulates commerce\r\nthereby. To make a thing which may be bought and sold, is not to\r\nprescribe regulations for buying and selling. Besides, if this were\r\nan exercise of the power of regulating commerce, it would be void, as\r\nextending as much to the internal commerce of every State, as to its\r\nexternal. For the power given to Congress by the constitution, does not\r\nextend to the internal regulation, of the commerce of a State (that\r\nis to say, of the commerce between citizen and citizen), which remains\r\nexclusively with its own legislature; but to its external commerce\r\nonly, that is to say, its commerce with another State, or with foreign\r\nnations, or with the Indian tribes. Accordingly, the bill does not\r\npropose the measure as a ‘regulation of trade,’ but as ‘productive of\r\nconsiderable advantage to trade.’\r\n\r\nStill less are these powers covered by any other of the special\r\nenumerations.\r\n\r\nII. Nor are they within either of the general phrases, which are the two\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\n1. ‘To lay taxes to provide for the general welfare of the United\r\nStates’; that is to say, ‘to lay taxes for the purpose of providing\r\nfor the general welfare.’ For the laying of taxes is the power, and\r\nthe general welfare the purpose for which the power is to be exercised.\r\nCongress are not to lay taxes, _ad libitum_, for any purpose they\r\nplease: but only to pay the debts, or provide for the welfare of the\r\nUnion. In like manner, they are not to do any thing they please, to\r\nprovide for the general welfare, but only to lay taxes for that purpose.\r\nTo consider the latter phrase, not as describing the purpose of the\r\nfirst, but as giving a distinct and independent power to do any act they\r\nplease, which might be for the good of the Union, would render all the\r\npreceding and subsequent enumerations of power completely useless.\r\nIt would reduce the whole instrument to a single phrase, that of\r\ninstituting a Congress with power to do whatever would be for the good\r\nof the United States; and as they would be the sole judges of the good\r\nor evil, it would be also a power to do whatever evil they pleased. It\r\nis an established rule of construction, where a phrase will bear either\r\nof two meanings, to give it that which will allow some meaning to the\r\nother parts of the instrument, and not that which will render all the\r\nothers useless. Certainly no such universal power was meant to be given\r\nthem. It was intended to lace them up straitly within the enumerated\r\npowers, and those without which, as means, these powers could not be\r\ncarried into effect. It is known that the very power now proposed as\r\na means, was rejected as an end by the convention which formed the\r\nconstitution. A proposition was made to them, to authorize Congress to\r\nopen parials, and an amendatory one, to empower them to incorporate.\r\nBut the whole was rejected; and one of the reasons of rejection urged\r\nin debate was, that they then would have a power to erect a bank,\r\nwhich would render the great cities, where there were prejudices\r\nand jealousies on that subject, adverse to the reception of the\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\n2. The second general phrase is, ‘to make all laws necessary and proper\r\nfor carrying into execution the enumerated powers.’ But they can all\r\nbe carried into execution without a bank. A bank, therefore, is not\r\nnecessary, and consequently, not authorized by this phrase.\r\n\r\nIt has been much urged, that a bank will give great facility or\r\nconvenience in the collection of taxes. Suppose this were true: yet the\r\nconstitution allows only the means which are ‘necessary’ not those which\r\nare merely ‘convenient’ for effecting the enumerated powers. If such\r\na latitude of construction be allowed to this phrase, as to give any\r\nnon-enumerated power, it will go to every one; for there is no one which\r\ningenuity may not torture into a convenience, in some way or other, to\r\nsome one of so long a list of enumerated powers. It would swallow up\r\nall the delegated powers, and reduce the whole to one phrase, as before\r\nobserved. Therefore it was, that the constitution restrained them to the\r\nnecessary means, that is to say, to those means without which the grant\r\nof the power would be nugatory.\r\n\r\nBut let us examine this ‘convenience,’ and see what it is. The report\r\non this subject, page 2, states the only general convenience to be, the\r\npreventing the transportation and re-transportation of money between the\r\nStates and the treasury. (For I pass over the increase of circulating\r\nmedium ascribed to it as a merit, and which, according to my ideas of\r\npaper money, is clearly a demerit.) Every State will have to pay a sum\r\nof tax-money into the treasury; and the treasury will have to pay in\r\nevery State a part of the interest on the public debt, and salaries\r\nto the officers of government resident in that State. In most of the\r\nStates, there will be still a surplus of tax-money, to come up to the\r\nseat of government, for the officers residing there. The payments of\r\ninterest and salary in each State, may be made by treasury orders on the\r\nstate collector. This will take up the greater part of the money he has\r\ncollected in his State and consequently prevent the great mass of it\r\nfrom being drawn out of the state. If there be a balance of commerce in\r\nfavor of that State, against the one in which the government resides,\r\nthe surplus of taxes will be remitted by the bills of exchange drawn for\r\nthat commercial balance. And so it must be if there were a bank. But if\r\nthere be no balance of commerce, either direct or circuitous, all the\r\nbanks in the world could not bring us the surplus of taxes but in the\r\nform of money. Treasury orders, then, and bills of exchange, may prevent\r\nthe displacement of the main mass of the money collected, without the\r\naid of any bank: and where these fail, it cannot be prevented even with\r\nthat aid.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, indeed, bank bills may be a more convenient vehicle than\r\ntreasury orders. But a little difference in the degree of convenience,\r\ncannot constitute the necessity which the constitution makes the ground\r\nfor assuming any non-enumerated power.\r\n\r\nBesides; the existing banks will, without doubt, enter into arrangements\r\nfor lending their agency, and the more favorable, as there will be a\r\ncompetition among them for it. Whereas, this bill delivers us up bound\r\nto the national bank, who are free to refuse all arrangements but on\r\ntheir own terms, and the public not free, on such refusal to employ any\r\nother bank. That of Philadelphia, I believe, now does this business by\r\ntheir post notes, which, by an arrangement with the treasury, are paid\r\nby any State collector to whom they are presented. This expedient alone,\r\nsuffices to prevent the existence of that necessity which may justify\r\nthe assumption of a non-enumerated power, as a means for carrying into\r\neffect an enumerated one. The thing may be done, and has been done, and\r\nwell done, without this assumption; therefore, it does not stand on that\r\ndegree of necessity which can honestly justify it.\r\n\r\nIt may be said, that a bank, whose bills would have a currency all over\r\nthe States, would be more convenient than one whose currency is limited\r\nto a single State. So it would be still more convenient, that there\r\nshould be a bank whose bills should have a currency all over the world.\r\nBut it does not follow from this superior conveniency, that there exists\r\nany where a power to establish such a bank, or that the world may not\r\ngo on very well without it. Can it be thought that the constitution\r\nintended, that for a shade or two of convenience, more or less, Congress\r\nshould be authorized to break down the most ancient and fundamental\r\nlaws of the several States, such as those against mortmain, the laws of\r\nalienage, the rules of descent, the acts of distribution, the laws\r\nof escheat and forfeiture, and the laws of monopoly. Nothing but a\r\nnecessity invincible by any other means, can justify such a prostration\r\nof laws, which constitute the pillars of our whole system of\r\njurisprudence. Will Congress be too strait-laced to carry the\r\nconstitution into honest effect, unless they may pass over the\r\nfoundation laws of the State governments, for the slightest convenience\r\nto theirs?\r\n\r\nThe negative of the President is the shield provided by the\r\nconstitution, to protect against the invasions of the legislature, 1.\r\nthe rights of the Executive; 2. of the Judiciary; 3. of the States\r\nand State legislatures. The present is the case of a right remaining\r\nexclusively with the States, and is, consequently, one of those intended\r\nby the constitution to be placed under his protection.\r\n\r\nIt must be added, however, that unless the President’s mind, on a view\r\nof every thing which is urged for and against this bill, is tolerably\r\nclear that it is unauthorized by the constitution, if the pro and the\r\ncon hang so even as to balance his judgment, a just respect for the\r\nwisdom of the legislature would naturally decide the balance in favor of\r\ntheir opinion. It is chiefly for cases where they are clearly misled by\r\nerror, ambition, or interest, that the constitution has placed a check\r\nin the negative of the President.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\nFebruary 15, 1791.",
