Vauquer (_nee_ de Conflans) is an elderly person, who for the past\r\nforty years has kept a lodging-house in the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve,\r\nin the district that lies between the Latin Quarter and the Faubourg\r\nSaint-Marcel. Her house (known in the neighborhood as the _Maison\r\nVauquer_) receives men and women, old and young, and no word has ever\r\nbeen breathed against her respectable establishment; but, at the same\r\ntime, it must be said that as a matter of fact no young woman has been\r\nunder her roof for thirty years, and that if a young man stays there for\r\nany length of time it is a sure sign that his allowance must be of the\r\nslenderest. In 1819, however, the time when this drama opens, there was\r\nan almost penniless young girl among Mme. Vauquer’s boarders.\r\n\r\nThat word drama has been somewhat discredited of late; it has been\r\noverworked and twisted to strange uses in these days of dolorous\r\nliterature; but it must do service again here, not because this story is\r\ndramatic in the restricted sense of the word, but because some tears may\r\nperhaps be shed _intra et extra muros_ before it is over.\r\n\r\nWill any one without the walls of Paris understand it? It is open to\r\ndoubt. The only audience who could appreciate the results of close\r\nobservation, the careful reproduction of minute detail and local color,\r\nare dwellers between the heights of Montrouge and Montmartre, in a vale\r\nof crumbling stucco watered by streams of black mud, a vale of sorrows\r\nwhich are real and joys too often hollow; but this audience is so\r\naccustomed to terrible sensations, that only some unimaginable and\r\nwell-neigh impossible woe could produce any lasting impression there.\r\nNow and again there are tragedies so awful and so grand by reason of the\r\ncomplication of virtues and vices that bring them about, that egotism\r\nand selfishness are forced to pause and are moved to pity; but the\r\nimpression that they receive is like a luscious fruit, soon consumed.\r\nCivilization, like the car of Juggernaut, is scarcely stayed perceptibly\r\nin its progress by a heart less easy to break than the others that lie\r\nin its course; this also is broken, and Civilization continues on her\r\ncourse triumphant. And you, too, will do the like; you who with this\r\nbook in your white hand will sink back among the cushions of your\r\narmchair, and say to yourself, “Perhaps this may amuse me.” You will\r\nread the story of Father Goriot’s secret woes, and, dining thereafter\r\nwith an unspoiled appetite, will lay the blame of your insensibility\r\nupon the writer, and accuse him of exaggeration, of writing romances.\r\nAh! once for all, this drama is neither a fiction nor a romance! _All is\r\ntrue_,--so true, that every one can discern the elements of the tragedy\r\nin his own house, perhaps in his own heart.\r\n\r\nThe lodging-house is Mme. Vauquer’s own property. It is still standing\r\nin the lower end of the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve, just where the road\r\nslopes so sharply down to the Rue de l’Arbalete, that wheeled traffic\r\nseldom passes that way, because it is so stony and steep. This position\r\nis sufficient to account for the silence prevalent in the streets shut\r\nin between the dome of the Pantheon and the dome of the Val-de-Grace,\r\ntwo conspicuous public buildings which give a yellowish tone to the\r\nlandscape and darken the whole district that lies beneath the shadow of\r\ntheir leaden-hued cupolas.\r\n\r\nIn that district the pavements are clean and dry, there is neither mud\r\nnor water in the gutters, grass grows in the chinks of the walls. The\r\nmost heedless passer-by feels the depressing influences of a place where\r\nthe sound of wheels creates a sensation; there is a grim look about the\r\nhouses, a suggestion of a jail about those high garden walls. A Parisian\r\nstraying into a suburb apparently composed of lodging-houses and public\r\ninstitutions would see poverty and dullness, old age lying down to die,\r\nand joyous youth condemned to drudgery. It is the ugliest quarter of\r\nParis, and, it may be added, the least known. But, before all things,\r\nthe Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve is like a bronze frame for a picture for\r\nwhich the mind cannot be too well prepared by the contemplation of sad\r\nhues and sober images. Even so, step by step the daylight decreases,\r\nand the cicerone’s droning voice grows hollower as the traveler descends\r\ninto the Catacombs. The comparison holds good! Who shall say which is\r\nmore ghastly, the sight of the bleached skulls or of dried-up human\r\nhearts?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe front of the lodging-house is at right angles to the road, and\r\nlooks out upon a little garden, so that you see the side of the house\r\nin section, as it were, from the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve. Beneath the\r\nwall of the house front there lies a channel, a fathom wide, paved with\r\ncobble-stones, and beside it runs a graveled walk bordered by geraniums\r\nand oleanders and pomegranates set in great blue and white glazed\r\nearthenware pots. Access into the graveled walk is afforded by a door,\r\nabove which the words MAISON VAUQUER may be read, and beneath, in rather\r\nsmaller letters, “_Lodgings for both sexes, etc._”\r\n\r\nDuring the day a glimpse into the garden is easily obtained through a\r\nwicket to which a bell is attached. On the opposite wall, at the further\r\nend of the graveled walk, a green marble arch was painted once upon\r\na time by a local artist, and in this semblance of a shrine a statue\r\nrepresenting Cupid is installed; a Parisian Cupid, so blistered and\r\ndisfigured that he looks like a candidate for one of the adjacent\r\nhospitals, and might suggest an allegory to lovers of symbolism. The\r\nhalf-obliterated inscription on the pedestal beneath determines the date\r\nof this work of art, for it bears witness to the widespread enthusiasm\r\nfelt for Voltaire on his return to Paris in 1777:\r\n\r\n\r\n              “Whoe’er thou art, thy master see;\r\n               He is, or was, or ought to be.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAt night the wicket gate is replaced by a solid door. The little garden\r\nis no wider than the front of the house; it is shut in between the wall\r\nof the street and the partition wall of the neighboring house. A mantle\r\nof ivy conceals the bricks and attracts the eyes of passers-by to an\r\neffect which is picturesque in Paris, for each of the walls is covered\r\nwith trellised vines that yield a scanty dusty crop of fruit, and\r\nfurnish besides a subject of conversation for Mme. Vauquer and her\r\nlodgers; every year the widow trembles for her vintage.\r\n\r\nA straight path beneath the walls on either side of the garden leads to\r\na clump of lime-trees at the further end of it; _line_-trees, as Mme.\r\nVauquer persists in calling them, in spite of the fact that she was a de\r\nConflans, and regardless of repeated corrections from her lodgers.\r\n\r\nThe central space between the walls is filled with artichokes and\r\nrows of pyramid fruit-trees, and surrounded by a border of lettuce,\r\npot-herbs, and parsley. Under the lime-trees there are a few\r\ngreen-painted garden seats and a wooden table, and hither, during the\r\ndog-days, such of the lodgers as are rich enough to indulge in a cup\r\nof coffee come to take their pleasure, though it is hot enough to roast\r\neggs even in the shade.\r\n\r\nThe house itself is three stories high, without counting the attics\r\nunder the roof. It is built of rough stone, and covered with the\r\nyellowish stucco that gives a mean appearance to almost every house in\r\nParis. There are five windows in each story in the front of the house;\r\nall the blinds visible through the small square panes are drawn up awry,\r\nso that the lines are all at cross purposes. At the side of the house\r\nthere are but two windows on each floor, and the lowest of all are\r\nadorned with a heavy iron grating.\r\n\r\nBehind the house a yard extends for some twenty feet, a space inhabited\r\nby a happy family of pigs, poultry, and rabbits; the wood-shed is\r\nsituated on the further side, and on the wall between the wood-shed and\r\nthe kitchen window hangs the meat-safe, just above the place where the\r\nsink discharges its greasy streams. The cook sweeps all the refuse\r\nout through a little door into the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve, and\r\nfrequently cleanses the yard with copious supplies of water, under pain\r\nof pestilence.\r\n\r\nThe house might have been built on purpose for its present uses. Access\r\nis given by a French window to the first room on the ground floor, a\r\nsitting-room which looks out upon the street through the two barred\r\nwindows already mentioned. Another door opens out of it into the\r\ndining-room, which is separated from the kitchen by the well of the\r\nstaircase, the steps being constructed partly of wood, partly of tiles,\r\nwhich are colored and beeswaxed. Nothing can be more depressing than\r\nthe sight of that sitting-room. The furniture is covered with horse hair\r\nwoven in alternate dull and glossy stripes. There is a round table in\r\nthe middle, with a purplish-red marble top, on which there stands, by\r\nway of ornament, the inevitable white china tea-service, covered with\r\na half-effaced gilt network. The floor is sufficiently uneven, the\r\nwainscot rises to elbow height, and the rest of the wall space is\r\ndecorated with a varnished paper, on which the principal scenes from\r\n_Telemaque_ are depicted, the various classical personages being\r\ncolored. The subject between the two windows is the banquet given by\r\nCalypso to the son of Ulysses, displayed thereon for the admiration of\r\nthe boarders, and has furnished jokes these forty years to the young\r\nmen who show themselves superior to their position by making fun of the\r\ndinners to which poverty condemns them. The hearth is always so clean\r\nand neat that it is evident that a fire is only kindled there on great\r\noccasions; the stone chimney-piece is adorned by a couple of vases\r\nfilled with faded artificial flowers imprisoned under glass shades, on\r\neither side of a bluish marble clock in the very worst taste.\r\n\r\nThe first room exhales an odor for which there is no name in the\r\nlanguage, and which should be called the _odeur de pension_. The damp\r\natmosphere sends a chill through you as you breathe it; it has a stuffy,\r\nmusty, and rancid quality; it permeates your clothing; after-dinner\r\nscents seem to be mingled in it with smells from the kitchen and\r\nscullery and the reek of a hospital. It might be possible to describe\r\nit if some one should discover a process by which to distil from the\r\natmosphere all the nauseating elements with which it is charged by the\r\ncatarrhal exhalations of every individual lodger, young or old. Yet,\r\nin spite of these stale horrors, the sitting-room is as charming and\r\nas delicately perfumed as a boudoir, when compared with the adjoining\r\ndining-room.\r\n\r\nThe paneled walls of that apartment were once painted some color, now\r\na matter of conjecture, for the surface is incrusted with accumulated\r\nlayers of grimy deposit, which cover it with fantastic outlines. A\r\ncollection of dim-ribbed glass decanters, metal discs with a satin sheen\r\non them, and piles of blue-edged earthenware plates of Touraine ware\r\ncover the sticky surfaces of the sideboards that line the room. In a\r\ncorner stands a box containing a set of numbered pigeon-holes, in which\r\nthe lodgers’ table napkins, more or less soiled and stained with wine,\r\nare kept. Here you see that indestructible furniture never met with\r\nelsewhere, which finds its way into lodging-houses much as the wrecks of\r\nour civilization drift into hospitals for incurables. You expect in such\r\nplaces as these to find the weather-house whence a Capuchin issues on\r\nwet days; you look to find the execrable engravings which spoil your\r\nappetite, framed every one in a black varnished frame, with a gilt\r\nbeading round it; you know the sort of tortoise-shell clock-case, inlaid\r\nwith brass; the green stove, the Argand lamps, covered with oil and\r\ndust, have met your eyes before. The oilcloth which covers the long\r\ntable is so greasy that a waggish _externe_ will write his name on the\r\nsurface, using his thumb-nail as a style. The chairs are broken-down\r\ninvalids; the wretched little hempen mats slip away from under your\r\nfeet without slipping away for good; and finally, the foot-warmers are\r\nmiserable wrecks, hingeless, charred, broken away about the holes. It\r\nwould be impossible to give an idea of the old, rotten, shaky, cranky,\r\nworm-eaten, halt, maimed, one-eyed, rickety, and ramshackle condition of\r\nthe furniture without an exhaustive description, which would delay\r\nthe progress of the story to an extent that impatient people would not\r\npardon. The red tiles of the floor are full of depressions brought about\r\nby scouring and periodical renewings of color. In short, there is\r\nno illusory grace left to the poverty that reigns here; it is dire,\r\nparsimonious, concentrated, threadbare poverty; as yet it has not sunk\r\ninto the mire, it is only splashed by it, and though not in rags as yet,\r\nits clothing is ready to drop to pieces.\r\n\r\nThis apartment is in all its glory at seven o’clock in the morning,\r\nwhen Mme. Vauquer’s cat appears, announcing the near approach of his\r\nmistress, and jumps upon the sideboards to sniff at the milk in the\r\nbowls, each protected by a plate, while he purrs his morning greeting to\r\nthe world. A moment later the widow shows her face; she is tricked out\r\nin a net cap attached to a false front set on awry, and shuffles into\r\nthe room in her slipshod fashion. She is an oldish woman, with a bloated\r\ncountenance, and a nose like a parrot’s beak set in the middle of\r\nit; her fat little hands (she is as sleek as a church rat) and her\r\nshapeless, slouching figure are in keeping with the room that reeks of\r\nmisfortune, where hope is reduced to speculate for the meanest\r\nstakes. Mme. Vauquer alone can breathe that tainted air without being\r\ndisheartened by it. Her face is as fresh as a frosty morning in autumn;\r\nthere are wrinkles about the eyes that vary in their expression from\r\nthe set smile of a ballet-dancer to the dark, suspicious scowl of\r\na discounter of bills; in short, she is at once the embodiment and\r\ninterpretation of her lodging-house, as surely as her lodging-house\r\nimplies the existence of its mistress. You can no more imagine the one\r\nwithout the other, than you can think of a jail without a turnkey. The\r\nunwholesome corpulence of the little woman is produced by the life she\r\nleads, just as typhus fever is bred in the tainted air of a hospital.\r\nThe very knitted woolen petticoat that she wears beneath a skirt made\r\nof an old gown, with the wadding protruding through the rents in the\r\nmaterial, is a sort of epitome of the sitting-room, the dining-room,\r\nand the little garden; it discovers the cook, it foreshadows the\r\nlodgers--the picture of the house is completed by the portrait of its\r\nmistress.\r\n\r\nMme. Vauquer at the age of fifty is like all women who “have seen a deal\r\nof trouble.” She has the glassy eyes and innocent air of a trafficker\r\nin flesh and blood, who will wax virtuously indignant to obtain a higher\r\nprice for her services, but who is quite ready to betray a Georges or\r\na Pichegru, if a Georges or a Pichegru were in hiding and still to be\r\nbetrayed, or for any other expedient that may alleviate her lot. Still,\r\n“she is a good woman at bottom,” said the lodgers who believed that\r\nthe widow was wholly dependent upon the money that they paid her, and\r\nsympathized when they heard her cough and groan like one of themselves.\r\n\r\nWhat had M. Vauquer been? The lady was never very explicit on this head.\r\nHow had she lost her money? “Through trouble,” was her answer. He had\r\ntreated her badly, had left her nothing but her eyes to cry over his\r\ncruelty, the house she lived in, and the privilege of pitying nobody,\r\nbecause, so she was wont to say, she herself had been through every\r\npossible misfortune.\r\n\r\nSylvie, the stout cook, hearing her mistress’ shuffling footsteps,\r\nhastened to serve the lodgers’ breakfasts. Beside those who lived in the\r\nhouse, Mme. Vauquer took boarders who came for their meals; but these\r\n_externes_ usually only came to dinner, for which they paid thirty\r\nfrancs a month.\r\n\r\nAt the time when this story begins, the lodging-house contained seven\r\ninmates. The best rooms in the house were on the first story, Mme.\r\nVauquer herself occupying the least important, while the rest were let\r\nto a Mme. Couture, the widow of a commissary-general in the service of\r\nthe Republic. With her lived Victorine Taillefer, a schoolgirl, to whom\r\nshe filled the place of mother. These two ladies paid eighteen hundred\r\nfrancs a year.\r\n\r\nThe two sets of rooms on the second floor were respectively occupied by\r\nan old man named Poiret and a man of forty or thereabouts, the wearer\r\nof a black wig and dyed whiskers, who gave out that he was a retired\r\nmerchant, and was addressed as M. Vautrin. Two of the four rooms on\r\nthe third floor were also let--one to an elderly spinster, a Mlle.\r\nMichonneau, and the other to a retired manufacturer of vermicelli,\r\nItalian paste and starch, who allowed the others to address him as\r\n“Father Goriot.” The remaining rooms were allotted to various birds of\r\npassage, to impecunious students, who like “Father Goriot” and Mlle.\r\nMichonneau, could only muster forty-five francs a month to pay for their\r\nboard and lodging. Mme. Vauquer had little desire for lodgers of this\r\nsort; they ate too much bread, and she only took them in default of\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nAt that time one of the rooms was tenanted by a law student, a young man\r\nfrom the neighborhood of Angouleme, one of a large family who pinched\r\nand starved themselves to spare twelve hundred francs a year for him.\r\nMisfortune had accustomed Eugene de Rastignac, for that was his name, to\r\nwork. He belonged to the number of young men who know as children that\r\ntheir parents’ hopes are centered on them, and deliberately prepare\r\nthemselves for a great career, subordinating their studies from the\r\nfirst to this end, carefully watching the indications of the course of\r\nevents, calculating the probable turn that affairs will take, that they\r\nmay be the first to profit by them. But for his observant curiosity, and\r\nthe skill with which he managed to introduce himself into the salons\r\nof Paris, this story would not have been colored by the tones of\r\ntruth which it certainly owes to him, for they are entirely due to his\r\npenetrating sagacity and desire to fathom the mysteries of an appalling\r\ncondition of things, which was concealed as carefully by the victim as\r\nby those who had brought it to pass.\r\n\r\nAbove the third story there was a garret where the linen was hung to\r\ndry, and a couple of attics. Christophe, the man-of-all-work, slept in\r\none, and Sylvie, the stout cook, in the other. Beside the seven inmates\r\nthus enumerated, taking one year with another, some eight law or medical\r\nstudents dined in the house, as well as two or three regular comers who\r\nlived in the neighborhood. There were usually eighteen people at dinner,\r\nand there was room, if need be, for twenty at Mme. Vauquer’s table; at\r\nbreakfast, however, only the seven lodgers appeared. It was almost like\r\na family party. Every one came down in dressing-gown and slippers,\r\nand the conversation usually turned on anything that had happened\r\nthe evening before; comments on the dress or appearance of the dinner\r\ncontingent were exchanged in friendly confidence.\r\n\r\nThese seven lodgers were Mme. Vauquer’s spoiled children. Among them\r\nshe distributed, with astronomical precision, the exact proportion of\r\nrespect and attention due to the varying amounts they paid for their\r\nboard. One single consideration influenced all these human beings thrown\r\ntogether by chance. The two second-floor lodgers only paid seventy-two\r\nfrancs a month. Such prices as these are confined to the Faubourg\r\nSaint-Marcel and the district between La Bourbe and the Salpetriere;\r\nand, as might be expected, poverty, more or less apparent, weighed upon\r\nthem all, Mme. Couture being the sole exception to the rule.\r\n\r\nThe dreary surroundings were reflected in the costumes of the inmates of\r\nthe house; all were alike threadbare. The color of the men’s coats were\r\nproblematical; such shoes, in more fashionable quarters, are only to be\r\nseen lying in the gutter; the cuffs and collars were worn and frayed at\r\nthe edges; every limp article of clothing looked like the ghost of its\r\nformer self. The women’s dresses were faded, old-fashioned, dyed and\r\nre-dyed; they wore gloves that were glazed with hard wear, much-mended\r\nlace, dingy ruffles, crumpled muslin fichus. So much for their\r\nclothing; but, for the most part, their frames were solid enough; their\r\nconstitutions had weathered the storms of life; their cold, hard faces\r\nwere worn like coins that have been withdrawn from circulation, but\r\nthere were greedy teeth behind the withered lips. Dramas brought to a\r\nclose or still in progress are foreshadowed by the sight of such actors\r\nas these, not the dramas that are played before the footlights and\r\nagainst a background of painted canvas, but dumb dramas of life,\r\nfrost-bound dramas that sere hearts like fire, dramas that do not end\r\nwith the actors’ lives.\r\n\r\nMlle. Michonneau, that elderly young lady, screened her weak eyes from\r\nthe daylight by a soiled green silk shade with a rim of brass, an object\r\nfit to scare away the Angel of Pity himself. Her shawl, with its scanty,\r\ndraggled fringe, might have covered a skeleton, so meagre and angular\r\nwas the form beneath it. Yet she must have been pretty and shapely once.\r\nWhat corrosive had destroyed the feminine outlines? Was it trouble,\r\nor vice, or greed? Had she loved too well? Had she been a second-hand\r\nclothes dealer, a frequenter of the backstairs of great houses, or had\r\nshe been merely a courtesan? Was she expiating the flaunting triumphs\r\nof a youth overcrowded with pleasures by an old age in which she was\r\nshunned by every passer-by? Her vacant gaze sent a chill through you;\r\nher shriveled face seemed like a menace. Her voice was like the shrill,\r\nthin note of the grasshopper sounding from the thicket when winter is at\r\nhand. She said that she had nursed an old gentleman, ill of catarrh of\r\nthe bladder, and left to die by his children, who thought that he had\r\nnothing left. His bequest to her, a life annuity of a thousand francs,\r\nwas periodically disputed by his heirs, who mingled slander with their\r\npersecutions. In spite of the ravages of conflicting passions, her face\r\nretained some traces of its former fairness and fineness of tissue, some\r\nvestiges of the physical charms of her youth still survived.\r\n\r\nM. Poiret was a sort of automaton. He might be seen any day sailing like\r\na gray shadow along the walks of the Jardin des Plantes, on his head a\r\nshabby cap, a cane with an old yellow ivory handle in the tips of his\r\nthin fingers; the outspread skirts of his threadbare overcoat failed\r\nto conceal his meagre figure; his breeches hung loosely on his shrunken\r\nlimbs; the thin, blue-stockinged legs trembled like those of a drunken\r\nman; there was a notable breach of continuity between the dingy white\r\nwaistcoat and crumpled shirt frills and the cravat twisted about a\r\nthroat like a turkey gobbler’s; altogether, his appearance set people\r\nwondering whether this outlandish ghost belonged to the audacious race\r\nof the sons of Japhet who flutter about on the Boulevard Italien. What\r\ndevouring kind of toil could have so shriveled him? What devouring\r\npassions had darkened that bulbous countenance, which would have seemed\r\noutrageous as a caricature? What had he been? Well, perhaps he had been\r\npart of the machinery of justice, a clerk in the office to which the\r\nexecutioner sends in his accounts,--so much for providing black veils\r\nfor parricides, so much for sawdust, so much for pulleys and cord for\r\nthe knife. Or he might have been a receiver at the door of a public\r\nslaughter-house, or a sub-inspector of nuisances. Indeed, the man\r\nappeared to have been one of the beasts of burden in our great social\r\nmill; one of those Parisian Ratons whom their Bertrands do not even know\r\nby sight; a pivot in the obscure machinery that disposes of misery and\r\nthings unclean; one of those men, in short, at sight of whom we are\r\nprompted to remark that, “After all, we cannot do without them.”\r\n\r\nStately Paris ignores the existence of these faces bleached by moral or\r\nphysical suffering; but, then, Paris is in truth an ocean that no line\r\ncan plumb. You may survey its surface and describe it; but no matter how\r\nnumerous and painstaking the toilers in this sea, there will always be\r\nlonely and unexplored regions in its depths, caverns unknown, flowers\r\nand pearls and monsters of the deep overlooked or forgotten by the\r\ndivers of literature. The Maison Vauquer is one of these curious\r\nmonstrosities.\r\n\r\nTwo, however, of Mme. Vauquer’s boarders formed a striking contrast to\r\nthe rest. There was a sickly pallor, such as is often seen in anaemic\r\ngirls, in Mlle. Victorine Taillefer’s face; and her unvarying expression\r\nof sadness, like her embarrassed manner and pinched look, was in\r\nkeeping with the general wretchedness of the establishment in the Rue\r\nNueve-Saint-Genevieve, which forms a background to this picture; but her\r\nface was young, there was youthfulness in her voice and elasticity\r\nin her movements. This young misfortune was not unlike a shrub, newly\r\nplanted in an uncongenial soil, where its leaves have already begun\r\nto wither. The outlines of her figure, revealed by her dress of the\r\nsimplest and cheapest materials, were also youthful. There was the same\r\nkind of charm about her too slender form, her faintly colored face and\r\nlight-brown hair, that modern poets find in mediaeval statuettes; and a\r\nsweet expression, a look of Christian resignation in the dark gray eyes.\r\nShe was pretty by force of contrast; if she had been happy, she would\r\nhave been charming. Happiness is the poetry of woman, as the toilette\r\nis her tinsel. If the delightful excitement of a ball had made the pale\r\nface glow with color; if the delights of a luxurious life had brought\r\nthe color to the wan cheeks that were slightly hollowed already; if love\r\nhad put light into the sad eyes, then Victorine might have ranked among\r\nthe fairest; but she lacked the two things which create woman a second\r\ntime--pretty dresses and love-letters.\r\n\r\nA book might have been made of her story. Her father was persuaded that\r\nhe had sufficient reason for declining to acknowledge her, and allowed\r\nher a bare six hundred francs a year; he had further taken measures\r\nto disinherit his daughter, and had converted all his real estate into\r\npersonalty, that he might leave it undivided to his son. Victorine’s\r\nmother had died broken-hearted in Mme. Couture’s house; and the\r\nlatter, who was a near relation, had taken charge of the little orphan.\r\nUnluckily, the widow of the commissary-general to the armies of the\r\nRepublic had nothing in the world but her jointure and her widow’s\r\npension, and some day she might be obliged to leave the helpless,\r\ninexperienced girl to the mercy of the world. The good soul, therefore,\r\ntook Victorine to mass every Sunday, and to confession once a fortnight,\r\nthinking that, in any case, she would bring up her ward to be devout.\r\nShe was right; religion offered a solution of the problem of the\r\nyoung girl’s future. The poor child loved the father who refused to\r\nacknowledge her. Once every year she tried to see him to deliver her\r\nmother’s message of forgiveness, but every year hitherto she had knocked\r\nat that door in vain; her father was inexorable. Her brother, her only\r\nmeans of communication, had not come to see her for four years, and had\r\nsent her no assistance; yet she prayed to God to unseal her father’s\r\neyes and to soften her brother’s heart, and no accusations mingled with\r\nher prayers. Mme. Couture and Mme. Vauquer exhausted the vocabulary\r\nof abuse, and failed to find words that did justice to the banker’s\r\niniquitous conduct; but while they heaped execrations on the\r\nmillionaire, Victorine’s words were as gentle as the moan of the wounded\r\ndove, and affection found expression even in the cry drawn from her by\r\npain.\r\n\r\nEugene de Rastignac was a thoroughly southern type; he had a fair\r\ncomplexion, blue eyes, black hair. In his figure, manner, and his whole\r\nbearing it was easy to see that he had either come of a noble family,\r\nor that, from his earliest childhood, he had been gently bred. If he\r\nwas careful of his wardrobe, only taking last year’s clothes into\r\ndaily wear, still upon occasion he could issue forth as a young man of\r\nfashion. Ordinarily he wore a shabby coat and waistcoat, the limp black\r\ncravat, untidily knotted, that students affect, trousers that matched\r\nthe rest of his costume, and boots that had been resoled.\r\n\r\nVautrin (the man of forty with the dyed whiskers) marked a transition\r\nstage between these two young people and the others. He was the kind of\r\nman that calls forth the remark: “He looks a jovial sort!” He had\r\nbroad shoulders, a well-developed chest, muscular arms, and strong\r\nsquare-fisted hands; the joints of his fingers were covered with tufts\r\nof fiery red hair. His face was furrowed by premature wrinkles; there\r\nwas a certain hardness about it in spite of his bland and insinuating\r\nmanner. His bass voice was by no means unpleasant, and was in keeping\r\nwith his boisterous laughter. He was always obliging, always in good\r\nspirits; if anything went wrong with one of the locks, he would soon\r\nunscrew it, take it to pieces, file it, oil and clean and set it in\r\norder, and put it back in its place again; “I am an old hand at it,”\r\n he used to say. Not only so, he knew all about ships, the sea, France,\r\nforeign countries, men, business, law, great houses and prisons,--there\r\nwas nothing that he did not know. If any one complained rather more than\r\nusual, he would offer his services at once. He had several times lent\r\nmoney to Mme. Vauquer, or to the boarders; but, somehow, those whom he\r\nobliged felt that they would sooner face death than fail to repay him; a\r\ncertain resolute look, sometimes seen on his face, inspired fear of him,\r\nfor all his appearance of easy good-nature. In the way he spat there was\r\nan imperturbable coolness which seemed to indicate that this was a\r\nman who would not stick at a crime to extricate himself from a false\r\nposition. His eyes, like those of a pitiless judge, seemed to go to\r\nthe very bottom of all questions, to read all natures, all feelings and\r\nthoughts. His habit of life was very regular; he usually went out after\r\nbreakfast, returning in time for dinner, and disappeared for the rest\r\nof the evening, letting himself in about midnight with a latch key, a\r\nprivilege that Mme. Vauquer accorded to no other boarder. But then he\r\nwas on very good terms with the widow; he used to call her “mamma,” and\r\nput his arm round her waist, a piece of flattery perhaps not appreciated\r\nto the full! The worthy woman might imagine this to be an easy feat;\r\nbut, as a matter of fact, no arm but Vautrin’s was long enough to\r\nencircle her.\r\n\r\nIt was a characteristic trait of his generously to pay fifteen francs a\r\nmonth for the cup of coffee with a dash of brandy in it, which he took\r\nafter dinner. Less superficial observers than young men engulfed by the\r\nwhirlpool of Parisian life, or old men, who took no interest in anything\r\nthat did not directly concern them, would not have stopped short at the\r\nvaguely unsatisfactory impression that Vautrin made upon them. He knew\r\nor guessed the concerns of every one about him; but none of them had\r\nbeen able to penetrate his thoughts, or to discover his occupation. He\r\nhad deliberately made his apparent good-nature, his unfailing readiness\r\nto oblige, and his high spirits into a barrier between himself and the\r\nrest of them, but not seldom he gave glimpses of appalling depths\r\nof character. He seemed to delight in scourging the upper classes of\r\nsociety with the lash of his tongue, to take pleasure in convicting it\r\nof inconsistency, in mocking at law and order with some grim jest worthy\r\nof Juvenal, as if some grudge against the social system rankled in him,\r\nas if there were some mystery carefully hidden away in his life.\r\n\r\nMlle. Taillefer felt attracted, perhaps unconsciously, by the strength\r\nof the one man, and the good looks of the other; her stolen glances and\r\nsecret thoughts were divided between them; but neither of them seemed\r\nto take any notice of her, although some day a chance might alter her\r\nposition, and she would be a wealthy heiress. For that matter, there was\r\nnot a soul in the house who took any trouble to investigate the various\r\nchronicles of misfortunes, real or imaginary, related by the rest. Each\r\none regarded the others with indifference, tempered by suspicion; it was\r\na natural result of their relative positions. Practical assistance not\r\none could give, this they all knew, and they had long since exhausted\r\ntheir stock of condolence over previous discussions of their grievances.\r\nThey were in something the same position as an elderly couple who have\r\nnothing left to say to each other. The routine of existence kept them in\r\ncontact, but they were parts of a mechanism which wanted oil. There was\r\nnot one of them but would have passed a blind man begging in the street,\r\nnot one that felt moved to pity by a tale of misfortune, not one who\r\ndid not see in death the solution of the all-absorbing problem of misery\r\nwhich left them cold to the most terrible anguish in others.\r\n\r\nThe happiest of these hapless beings was certainly Mme. Vauquer, who\r\nreigned supreme over this hospital supported by voluntary contributions.\r\nFor her, the little garden, which silence, and cold, and rain, and\r\ndrought combined to make as dreary as an Asian _steppe_, was a pleasant\r\nshaded nook; the gaunt yellow house, the musty odors of a back shop had\r\ncharms for her, and for her alone. Those cells belonged to her. She fed\r\nthose convicts condemned to penal servitude for life, and her authority\r\nwas recognized among them. Where else in Paris would they have found\r\nwholesome food in sufficient quantity at the prices she charged them,\r\nand rooms which they were at liberty to make, if not exactly elegant or\r\ncomfortable, at any rate clean and healthy? If she had committed some\r\nflagrant act of injustice, the victim would have borne it in silence.\r\n\r\nSuch a gathering contained, as might have been expected, the elements\r\nout of which a complete society might be constructed. And, as in a\r\nschool, as in the world itself, there was among the eighteen men and\r\nwomen who met round the dinner table a poor creature, despised by\r\nall the others, condemned to be the butt of all their jokes. At the\r\nbeginning of Eugene de Rastignac’s second twelvemonth, this figure\r\nsuddenly started out into bold relief against the background of human\r\nforms and faces among which the law student was yet to live for\r\nanother two years to come. This laughing-stock was the retired\r\nvermicelli-merchant, Father Goriot, upon whose face a painter, like the\r\nhistorian, would have concentrated all the light in his picture.\r\n\r\nHow had it come about that the boarders regarded him with a\r\nhalf-malignant contempt? Why did they subject the oldest among their\r\nnumber to a kind of persecution, in which there was mingled some pity,\r\nbut no respect for his misfortunes? Had he brought it on himself by some\r\neccentricity or absurdity, which is less easily forgiven or forgotten\r\nthan more serious defects? The question strikes at the root of many a\r\nsocial injustice. Perhaps it is only human nature to inflict suffering\r\non anything that will endure suffering, whether by reason of its genuine\r\nhumility, or indifference, or sheer helplessness. Do we not, one and\r\nall, like to feel our strength even at the expense of some one or of\r\nsomething? The poorest sample of humanity, the street arab, will pull\r\nthe bell handle at every street door in bitter weather, and scramble up\r\nto write his name on the unsullied marble of a monument.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1813, at the age of sixty-nine or thereabouts, “Father\r\nGoriot” had sold his business and retired--to Mme. Vauquer’s boarding\r\nhouse. When he first came there he had taken the rooms now occupied by\r\nMme. Couture; he had paid twelve hundred francs a year like a man to\r\nwhom five louis more or less was a mere trifle. For him Mme. Vauquer had\r\nmade various improvements in the three rooms destined for his use, in\r\nconsideration of a certain sum paid in advance, so it was said, for the\r\nmiserable furniture, that is to say, for some yellow cotton curtains, a\r\nfew chairs of stained wood covered with Utrecht velvet, several wretched\r\ncolored prints in frames, and wall papers that a little suburban tavern\r\nwould have disdained. Possibly it was the careless generosity with which\r\nFather Goriot allowed himself to be overreached at this period of his\r\nlife (they called him Monsieur Goriot very respectfully then) that gave\r\nMme. Vauquer the meanest opinion of his business abilities; she looked\r\non him as an imbecile where money was concerned.\r\n\r\nGoriot had brought with him a considerable wardrobe, the gorgeous\r\noutfit of a retired tradesman who denies himself nothing. Mme. Vauquer’s\r\nastonished eyes beheld no less than eighteen cambric-fronted shirts, the\r\nsplendor of their fineness being enhanced by a pair of pins each bearing\r\na large diamond, and connected by a short chain, an ornament which\r\nadorned the vermicelli-maker’s shirt front. He usually wore a coat of\r\ncorn-flower blue; his rotund and portly person was still further set\r\noff by a clean white waistcoat, and a gold chain and seals which dangled\r\nover that broad expanse. When his hostess accused him of being “a bit\r\nof a beau,” he smiled with the vanity of a citizen whose foible is\r\ngratified. His cupboards (_ormoires_, as he called them in the popular\r\ndialect) were filled with a quantity of plate that he brought with him.\r\nThe widow’s eyes gleamed as she obligingly helped him to unpack the\r\nsoup ladles, table-spoons, forks, cruet-stands, tureens, dishes,\r\nand breakfast services--all of silver, which were duly arranged upon\r\nshelves, besides a few more or less handsome pieces of plate, all\r\nweighing no inconsiderable number of ounces; he could not bring himself\r\nto part with these gifts that reminded him of past domestic festivals.\r\n\r\n“This was my wife’s present to me on the first anniversary of our\r\nwedding day,” he said to Mme. Vauquer, as he put away a little silver\r\nposset dish, with two turtle-doves billing on the cover. “Poor dear! she\r\nspent on it all the money she had saved before we were married. Do\r\nyou know, I would sooner scratch the earth with my nails for a living,\r\nmadame, than part with that. But I shall be able to take my coffee out\r\nof it every morning for the rest of my days, thank the Lord! I am not to\r\nbe pitied. There’s not much fear of my starving for some time to come.”\r\n\r\nFinally, Mme. Vauquer’s magpie’s eye had discovered and read certain\r\nentries in the list of shareholders in the funds, and, after a rough\r\ncalculation, was disposed to credit Goriot (worthy man) with something\r\nlike ten thousand francs a year. From that day forward Mme. Vauquer\r\n(_nee_ de Conflans), who, as a matter of fact, had seen forty-eight\r\nsummers, though she would only own to thirty-nine of them--Mme. Vauquer\r\nhad her own ideas. Though Goriot’s eyes seemed to have shrunk in their\r\nsockets, though they were weak and watery, owing to some glandular\r\naffection which compelled him to wipe them continually, she considered\r\nhim to be a very gentlemanly and pleasant-looking man. Moreover, the\r\nwidow saw favorable indications of character in the well-developed\r\ncalves of his legs and in his square-shaped nose, indications still\r\nfurther borne out by the worthy man’s full-moon countenance and look\r\nof stupid good-nature. This, in all probability, was a strongly-build\r\nanimal, whose brains mostly consisted in a capacity for affection. His\r\nhair, worn in _ailes de pigeon_, and duly powdered every morning by the\r\nbarber from the Ecole Polytechnique, described five points on his low\r\nforehead, and made an elegant setting to his face. Though his manners\r\nwere somewhat boorish, he was always as neat as a new pin and he took\r\nhis snuff in a lordly way, like a man who knows that his snuff-box is\r\nalways likely to be filled with maccaboy, so that when Mme. Vauquer lay\r\ndown to rest on the day of M. Goriot’s installation, her heart, like a\r\nlarded partridge, sweltered before the fire of a burning desire to shake\r\noff the shroud of Vauquer and rise again as Goriot. She would marry\r\nagain, sell her boarding-house, give her hand to this fine flower of\r\ncitizenship, become a lady of consequence in the quarter, and ask for\r\nsubscriptions for charitable purposes; she would make little Sunday\r\nexcursions to Choisy, Soissy, Gentilly; she would have a box at the\r\ntheatre when she liked, instead of waiting for the author’s tickets that\r\none of her boarders sometimes gave her, in July; the whole Eldorado of\r\na little Parisian household rose up before Mme. Vauquer in her\r\ndreams. Nobody knew that she herself possessed forty thousand francs,\r\naccumulated _sou by sou_, that was her secret; surely as far as money\r\nwas concerned she was a very tolerable match. “And in other respects,\r\nI am quite his equal,” she said to herself, turning as if to assure\r\nherself of the charms of a form that the portly Sylvie found moulded in\r\ndown feathers every morning.\r\n\r\nFor three months from that day Mme. Veuve Vauquer availed herself of\r\nthe services of M. Goriot’s coiffeur, and went to some expense over her\r\ntoilette, expense justifiable on the ground that she owed it to herself\r\nand her establishment to pay some attention to appearances when such\r\nhighly-respectable persons honored her house with their presence. She\r\nexpended no small amount of ingenuity in a sort of weeding process of\r\nher lodgers, announcing her intention of receiving henceforward none but\r\npeople who were in every way select. If a stranger presented himself,\r\nshe let him know that M. Goriot, one of the best known and most\r\nhighly-respected merchants in Paris, had singled out her boarding-house\r\nfor a residence. She drew up a prospectus headed MAISON VAUQUER, in\r\nwhich it was asserted that hers was “_one of the oldest and most highly\r\nrecommended boarding-houses in the Latin Quarter_.” “From the windows\r\nof the house,” thus ran the prospectus, “there is a charming view of\r\nthe Vallee des Gobelins (so there is--from the third floor), and a\r\n_beautiful_ garden, _extending_ down to _an avenue of lindens_ at the\r\nfurther end.” Mention was made of the bracing air of the place and its\r\nquiet situation.\r\n\r\nIt was this prospectus that attracted Mme. la Comtesse de l’Ambermesnil,\r\na widow of six and thirty, who was awaiting the final settlement of her\r\nhusband’s affairs, and of another matter regarding a pension due to her\r\nas the wife of a general who had died “on the field of battle.” On this\r\nMme. Vauquer saw to her table, lighted a fire daily in the sitting-room\r\nfor nearly six months, and kept the promise of her prospectus, even\r\ngoing to some expense to do so. And the Countess, on her side, addressed\r\nMme. Vauquer as “my dear,” and promised her two more boarders, the\r\nBaronne de Vaumerland and the widow of a colonel, the late Comte de\r\nPicquoisie, who were about to leave a boarding-house in the Marais,\r\nwhere the terms were higher than at the Maison Vauquer. Both these\r\nladies, moreover, would be very well to do when the people at the\r\nWar Office had come to an end of their formalities. “But Government\r\ndepartments are always so dilatory,” the lady added.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner the two widows went together up to Mme. Vauquer’s room, and\r\nhad a snug little chat over some cordial and various delicacies reserved\r\nfor the mistress of the house. Mme. Vauquer’s ideas as to Goriot were\r\ncordially approved by Mme. de l’Ambermesnil; it was a capital notion,\r\nwhich for that matter she had guessed from the very first; in her\r\nopinion the vermicelli maker was an excellent man.\r\n\r\n“Ah! my dear lady, such a well-preserved man of his age, as sound as my\r\neyesight--a man who might make a woman happy!” said the widow.\r\n\r\nThe good-natured Countess turned to the subject of Mme. Vauquer’s dress,\r\nwhich was not in harmony with her projects. “You must put yourself on a\r\nwar footing,” said she.\r\n\r\nAfter much serious consideration the two widows went shopping\r\ntogether--they purchased a hat adorned with ostrich feathers and a cap\r\nat the Palais Royal, and the Countess took her friend to the Magasin de\r\nla Petite Jeannette, where they chose a dress and a scarf. Thus equipped\r\nfor the campaign, the widow looked exactly like the prize animal hung\r\nout for a sign above an a la mode beef shop; but she herself was so much\r\npleased with the improvement, as she considered it, in her appearance,\r\nthat she felt that she lay under some obligation to the Countess; and,\r\nthough by no means open-handed, she begged that lady to accept a hat\r\nthat cost twenty francs. The fact was that she needed the Countess’\r\nservices on the delicate mission of sounding Goriot; the countess must\r\nsing her praises in his ears. Mme. de l’Ambermesnil lent herself very\r\ngood-naturedly to this manoeuvre, began her operations, and succeeded in\r\nobtaining a private interview; but the overtures that she made, with a\r\nview to securing him for herself, were received with embarrassment, not\r\nto say a repulse. She left him, revolted by his coarseness.\r\n\r\n“My angel,” said she to her dear friend, “you will make nothing of that\r\nman yonder. He is absurdly suspicious, and he is a mean curmudgeon, an\r\nidiot, a fool; you would never be happy with him.”\r\n\r\nAfter what had passed between M. Goriot and Mme. de l’Ambermesnil, the\r\nCountess would no longer live under the same roof. She left the next\r\nday, forgot to pay for six months’ board, and left behind her wardrobe,\r\ncast-off clothing to the value of five francs. Eagerly and persistently\r\nas Mme. Vauquer sought her quondam lodger, the Comtesse de l’Ambermesnil\r\nwas never heard of again in Paris. The widow often talked of this\r\ndeplorable business, and regretted her own too confiding disposition. As\r\na matter of fact, she was as suspicious as a cat; but she was like many\r\nother people, who cannot trust their own kin and put themselves at the\r\nmercy of the next chance comer--an odd but common phenomenon, whose\r\ncauses may readily be traced to the depths of the human heart.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there are people who know that they have nothing more to look\r\nfor from those with whom they live; they have shown the emptiness of\r\ntheir hearts to their housemates, and in their secret selves they are\r\nconscious that they are severely judged, and that they deserve to\r\nbe judged severely; but still they feel an unconquerable craving for\r\npraises that they do not hear, or they are consumed by a desire to\r\nappear to possess, in the eyes of a new audience, the qualities which\r\nthey have not, hoping to win the admiration or affection of strangers at\r\nthe risk of forfeiting it again some day. Or, once more, there are other\r\nmercenary natures who never do a kindness to a friend or a relation\r\nsimply because these have a claim upon them, while a service done to a\r\nstranger brings its reward to self-love. Such natures feel but little\r\naffection for those who are nearest to them; they keep their kindness\r\nfor remoter circles of acquaintance, and show most to those who dwell on\r\nits utmost limits. Mme. Vauquer belonged to both these essentially mean,\r\nfalse, and execrable classes.\r\n\r\n“If I had been there at the time,” Vautrin would say at the end of the\r\nstory, “I would have shown her up, and that misfortune would not have\r\nbefallen you. I know that kind of phiz!”\r\n\r\nLike all narrow natures, Mme. Vauquer was wont to confine her attention\r\nto events, and did not go very deeply into the causes that brought them\r\nabout; she likewise preferred to throw the blame of her own mistakes on\r\nother people, so she chose to consider that the honest vermicelli maker\r\nwas responsible for her misfortune. It had opened her eyes, so she said,\r\nwith regard to him. As soon as she saw that her blandishments were in\r\nvain, and that her outlay on her toilette was money thrown away, she was\r\nnot slow to discover the reason of his indifference. It became plain\r\nto her at once that there was _some other attraction_, to use her own\r\nexpression. In short, it was evident that the hope she had so fondly\r\ncherished was a baseless delusion, and that she would “never make\r\nanything out of that man yonder,” in the Countess’ forcible phrase.\r\nThe Countess seemed to have been a judge of character. Mme. Vauquer’s\r\naversion was naturally more energetic than her friendship, for her\r\nhatred was not in proportion to her love, but to her disappointed\r\nexpectations. The human heart may find here and there a resting-place\r\nshort of the highest height of affection, but we seldom stop in the\r\nsteep, downward slope of hatred. Still, M. Goriot was a lodger, and\r\nthe widow’s wounded self-love could not vent itself in an explosion of\r\nwrath; like a monk harassed by the prior of his convent, she was forced\r\nto stifle her sighs of disappointment, and to gulp down her craving for\r\nrevenge. Little minds find gratification for their feelings, benevolent\r\nor otherwise, by a constant exercise of petty ingenuity. The widow\r\nemployed her woman’s malice to devise a system of covert persecution.\r\nShe began by a course of retrenchment--various luxuries which had found\r\ntheir way to the table appeared there no more.\r\n\r\n“No more gherkins, no more anchovies; they have made a fool of me!” she\r\nsaid to Sylvie one morning, and they returned to the old bill of fare.\r\n\r\nThe thrifty frugality necessary to those who mean to make their way in\r\nthe world had become an inveterate habit of life with M. Goriot. Soup,\r\nboiled beef, and a dish of vegetables had been, and always would be, the\r\ndinner he liked best, so Mme. Vauquer found it very difficult to annoy\r\na boarder whose tastes were so simple. He was proof against her malice,\r\nand in desperation she spoke to him and of him slightingly before the\r\nother lodgers, who began to amuse themselves at his expense, and so\r\ngratified her desire for revenge.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the first year the widow’s suspicions had reached\r\nsuch a pitch that she began to wonder how it was that a retired merchant\r\nwith a secure income of seven or eight thousand livres, the owner of\r\nsuch magnificent plate and jewelry handsome enough for a kept mistress,\r\nshould be living in her house. Why should he devote so small a\r\nproportion of his money to his expenses? Until the first year was nearly\r\nat an end, Goriot had dined out once or twice every week, but these\r\noccasions came less frequently, and at last he was scarcely absent from\r\nthe dinner-table twice a month. It was hardly expected that Mme. Vauquer\r\nshould regard the increased regularity of her boarder’s habits with\r\ncomplacency, when those little excursions of his had been so much to her\r\ninterest. She attributed the change not so much to a gradual diminution\r\nof fortune as to a spiteful wish to annoy his hostess. It is one of the\r\nmost detestable habits of a Liliputian mind to credit other people with\r\nits own malignant pettiness.\r\n\r\nUnluckily, towards the end of the second year, M. Goriot’s conduct gave\r\nsome color to the idle talk about him. He asked Mme. Vauquer to give him\r\na room on the second floor, and to make a corresponding reduction in\r\nher charges. Apparently, such strict economy was called for, that he did\r\nwithout a fire all through the winter. Mme. Vauquer asked to be paid in\r\nadvance, an arrangement to which M. Goriot consented, and thenceforward\r\nshe spoke of him as “Father Goriot.”\r\n\r\nWhat had brought about this decline and fall? Conjecture was keen, but\r\ninvestigation was difficult. Father Goriot was not communicative; in\r\nthe sham countess’ phrase he was “a curmudgeon.” Empty-headed people who\r\nbabble about their own affairs because they have nothing else to occupy\r\nthem, naturally conclude that if people say nothing of their doings it\r\nis because their doings will not bear being talked about; so the highly\r\nrespectable merchant became a scoundrel, and the late beau was an old\r\nrogue. Opinion fluctuated. Sometimes, according to Vautrin, who came\r\nabout this time to live in the Maison Vauquer, Father Goriot was a man\r\nwho went on ‘Change and _dabbled_ (to use the sufficiently expressive\r\nlanguage of the Stock Exchange) in stocks and shares after he had ruined\r\nhimself by heavy speculation. Sometimes it was held that he was one of\r\nthose petty gamblers who nightly play for small stakes until they win a\r\nfew francs. A theory that he was a detective in the employ of the Home\r\nOffice found favor at one time, but Vautrin urged that “Goriot was not\r\nsharp enough for one of that sort.” There were yet other solutions;\r\nFather Goriot was a skinflint, a shark of a money-lender, a man\r\nwho lived by selling lottery tickets. He was by turns all the most\r\nmysterious brood of vice and shame and misery; yet, however vile his\r\nlife might be, the feeling of repulsion which he aroused in others was\r\nnot so strong that he must be banished from their society--he paid\r\nhis way. Besides, Goriot had his uses, every one vented his spleen or\r\nsharpened his wit on him; he was pelted with jokes and belabored with\r\nhard words. The general consensus of opinion was in favor of a theory\r\nwhich seemed the most likely; this was Mme. Vauquer’s view. According\r\nto her, the man so well preserved at his time of life, as sound as her\r\neyesight, with whom a woman might be very happy, was a libertine who had\r\nstrange tastes. These are the facts upon which Mme. Vauquer’s slanders\r\nwere based.\r\n\r\nEarly one morning, some few months after the departure of the unlucky\r\nCountess who had managed to live for six months at the widow’s expense,\r\nMme. Vauquer (not yet dressed) heard the rustle of a silk dress and\r\na young woman’s light footstep on the stair; some one was going to\r\nGoriot’s room. He seemed to expect the visit, for his door stood ajar.\r\nThe portly Sylvie presently came up to tell her mistress that a girl too\r\npretty to be honest, “dressed like a goddess,” and not a speck of mud\r\non her laced cashmere boots, had glided in from the street like a snake,\r\nhad found the kitchen, and asked for M. Goriot’s room. Mme. Vauquer\r\nand the cook, listening, overheard several words affectionately spoken\r\nduring the visit, which lasted for some time. When M. Goriot went\r\ndownstairs with the lady, the stout Sylvie forthwith took her basket\r\nand followed the lover-like couple, under pretext of going to do her\r\nmarketing.\r\n\r\n“M. Goriot must be awfully rich, all the same, madame,” she reported\r\non her return, “to keep her in such style. Just imagine it! There was a\r\nsplendid carriage waiting at the corner of the Place de l’Estrapade, and\r\n_she_ got into it.”\r\n\r\nWhile they were at dinner that evening, Mme. Vauquer went to the window\r\nand drew the curtain, as the sun was shining into Goriot’s eyes.\r\n\r\n“You are beloved of fair ladies, M. Goriot--the sun seeks you out,” she\r\nsaid, alluding to his visitor. “_Peste!_ you have good taste; she was\r\nvery pretty.”\r\n\r\n“That was my daughter,” he said, with a kind of pride in his voice, and\r\nthe rest chose to consider this as the fatuity of an old man who wishes\r\nto save appearances.\r\n\r\nA month after this visit M. Goriot received another. The same daughter\r\nwho had come to see him that morning came again after dinner, this time\r\nin evening dress. The boarders, in deep discussion in the dining-room,\r\ncaught a glimpse of a lovely, fair-haired woman, slender, graceful, and\r\nmuch too distinguished-looking to be a daughter of Father Goriot’s.\r\n\r\n“Two of them!” cried the portly Sylvie, who did not recognize the lady\r\nof the first visit.\r\n\r\nA few days later, and another young lady--a tall, well-moulded brunette,\r\nwith dark hair and bright eyes--came to ask for M. Goriot.\r\n\r\n“Three of them!” said Sylvie.\r\n\r\nThen the second daughter, who had first come in the morning to see her\r\nfather, came shortly afterwards in the evening. She wore a ball dress,\r\nand came in a carriage.\r\n\r\n“Four of them!” commented Mme. Vauquer and her plump handmaid. Sylvie\r\nsaw not a trace of resemblance between this great lady and the girl in\r\nher simple morning dress who had entered her kitchen on the occasion of\r\nher first visit.\r\n\r\nAt that time Goriot was paying twelve hundred francs a year to his\r\nlandlady, and Mme. Vauquer saw nothing out of the common in the fact\r\nthat a rich man had four or five mistresses; nay, she thought it very\r\nknowing of him to pass them off as his daughters. She was not at all\r\ninclined to draw a hard-and-fast line, or to take umbrage at his sending\r\nfor them to the Maison Vauquer; yet, inasmuch as these visits explained\r\nher boarder’s indifference to her, she went so far (at the end of the\r\nsecond year) as to speak of him as an “ugly old wretch.” When at length\r\nher boarder declined to nine hundred francs a year, she asked him very\r\ninsolently what he took her house to be, after meeting one of these\r\nladies on the stairs. Father Goriot answered that the lady was his\r\neldest daughter.\r\n\r\n“So you have two or three dozen daughters, have you?” said Mme. Vauquer\r\nsharply.\r\n\r\n“I have only two,” her boarder answered meekly, like a ruined man who is\r\nbroken in to all the cruel usage of misfortune.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the third year Father Goriot reduced his expenses\r\nstill further; he went up to the third story, and now paid forty-five\r\nfrancs a month. He did without snuff, told his hairdresser that he no\r\nlonger required his services, and gave up wearing powder. When Goriot\r\nappeared for the first time in this condition, an exclamation of\r\nastonishment broke from his hostess at the color of his hair--a dingy\r\nolive gray. He had grown sadder day by day under the influence of some\r\nhidden trouble; among all the faces round the table, his was the\r\nmost woe-begone. There was no longer any doubt. Goriot was an elderly\r\nlibertine, whose eyes had only been preserved by the skill of the\r\nphysician from the malign influence of the remedies necessitated by the\r\nstate of his health. The disgusting color of his hair was a result of\r\nhis excesses and of the drugs which he had taken that he might continue\r\nhis career. The poor old man’s mental and physical condition afforded\r\nsome grounds for the absurd rubbish talked about him. When his outfit\r\nwas worn out, he replaced the fine linen by calico at fourteen _sous_\r\nthe ell. His diamonds, his gold snuff-box, watch-chain and trinkets,\r\ndisappeared one by one. He had left off wearing the corn-flower blue\r\ncoat, and was sumptuously arrayed, summer as well as winter, in a coarse\r\nchestnut-brown coat, a plush waistcoat, and doeskin breeches. He grew\r\nthinner and thinner; his legs were shrunken, his cheeks, once so puffed\r\nout by contented bourgeois prosperity, were covered with wrinkles, and\r\nthe outlines of the jawbones were distinctly visible; there were deep\r\nfurrows in his forehead. In the fourth year of his residence in the Rue\r\nNeuve-Sainte-Genevieve he was no longer like his former self. The hale\r\nvermicelli manufacturer, sixty-two years of age, who had looked scarce\r\nforty, the stout, comfortable, prosperous tradesman, with an almost\r\nbucolic air, and such a brisk demeanor that it did you good to look at\r\nhim; the man with something boyish in his smile, had suddenly sunk into\r\nhis dotage, and had become a feeble, vacillating septuagenarian.\r\n\r\nThe keen, bright blue eyes had grown dull, and faded to a steel-gray\r\ncolor; the red inflamed rims looked as though they had shed tears of\r\nblood. He excited feelings of repulsion in some, and of pity in others.\r\nThe young medical students who came to the house noticed the drooping\r\nof his lower lip and the conformation of the facial angle; and, after\r\nteasing him for some time to no purpose, they declared that cretinism\r\nwas setting in.\r\n\r\nOne evening after dinner Mme. Vauquer said half banteringly to him, “So\r\nthose daughters of yours don’t come to see you any more, eh?” meaning to\r\nimply her doubts as to his paternity; but Father Goriot shrank as if his\r\nhostess had touched him with a sword-point.\r\n\r\n“They come sometimes,” he said in a tremulous voice.\r\n\r\n“Aha! you still see them sometimes?” cried the students. “Bravo, Father\r\nGoriot!”\r\n\r\nThe old man scarcely seemed to hear the witticisms at his expense that\r\nfollowed on the words; he had relapsed into the dreamy state of mind\r\nthat these superficial observers took for senile torpor, due to his lack\r\nof intelligence. If they had only known, they might have been deeply\r\ninterested by the problem of his condition; but few problems were more\r\nobscure. It was easy, of course, to find out whether Goriot had really\r\nbeen a vermicelli manufacturer; the amount of his fortune was readily\r\ndiscoverable; but the old people, who were most inquisitive as to his\r\nconcerns, never went beyond the limits of the Quarter, and lived in\r\nthe lodging-house much as oysters cling to a rock. As for the rest, the\r\ncurrent of life in Paris daily awaited them, and swept them away with\r\nit; so soon as they left the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve, they forgot the\r\nexistence of the old man, their butt at dinner. For those narrow souls,\r\nor for careless youth, the misery in Father Goriot’s withered face\r\nand its dull apathy were quite incompatible with wealth or any sort of\r\nintelligence. As for the creatures whom he called his daughters, all\r\nMme. Vauquer’s boarders were of her opinion. With the faculty for severe\r\nlogic sedulously cultivated by elderly women during long evenings of\r\ngossip till they can always find an hypothesis to fit all circumstances,\r\nshe was wont to reason thus:\r\n\r\n“If Father Goriot had daughters of his own as rich as those ladies who\r\ncame here seemed to be, he would not be lodging in my house, on the\r\nthird floor, at forty-five francs a month; and he would not go about\r\ndressed like a poor man.”\r\n\r\nNo objection could be raised to these inferences. So by the end of\r\nthe month of November 1819, at the time when the curtain rises on this\r\ndrama, every one in the house had come to have a very decided opinion as\r\nto the poor old man. He had never had either wife or daughter; excesses\r\nhad reduced him to this sluggish condition; he was a sort of human\r\nmollusk who should be classed among the capulidoe, so one of the dinner\r\ncontingent, an _employe_ at the Museum, who had a pretty wit of his own.\r\nPoiret was an eagle, a gentleman, compared with Goriot. Poiret would\r\njoin the talk, argue, answer when he was spoken to; as a matter of\r\nfact, his talk, arguments, and responses contributed nothing to the\r\nconversation, for Poiret had a habit of repeating what the others said\r\nin different words; still, he did join in the talk; he was alive, and\r\nseemed capable of feeling; while Father Goriot (to quote the Museum\r\nofficial again) was invariably at zero degrees--Reaumur.\r\n\r\nEugene de Rastignac had just returned to Paris in a state of mind not\r\nunknown to young men who are conscious of unusual powers, and to those\r\nwhose faculties are so stimulated by a difficult position, that for the\r\ntime being they rise above the ordinary level.\r\n\r\nRastignac’s first year of study for the preliminary examinations in law\r\nhad left him free to see the sights of Paris and to enjoy some of its\r\namusements. A student has not much time on his hands if he sets himself\r\nto learn the repertory of every theatre, and to study the ins and outs\r\nof the labyrinth of Paris. To know its customs; to learn the language,\r\nand become familiar with the amusements of the capital, he must explore\r\nits recesses, good and bad, follow the studies that please him best, and\r\nform some idea of the treasures contained in galleries and museums.\r\n\r\nAt this stage of his career a student grows eager and excited about all\r\nsorts of follies that seem to him to be of immense importance. He has\r\nhis hero, his great man, a professor at the College de France, paid\r\nto talk down to the level of his audience. He adjusts his cravat, and\r\nstrikes various attitudes for the benefit of the women in the first\r\ngalleries at the Opera-Comique. As he passes through all these\r\nsuccessive initiations, and breaks out of his sheath, the horizons of\r\nlife widen around him, and at length he grasps the plan of society with\r\nthe different human strata of which it is composed.\r\n\r\nIf he begins by admiring the procession of carriages on sunny afternoons\r\nin the Champs-Elysees, he soon reaches the further stage of envying\r\ntheir owners. Unconsciously, Eugene had served his apprenticeship before\r\nhe went back to Angouleme for the long vacation after taking his degrees\r\nas bachelor of arts and bachelor of law. The illusions of childhood had\r\nvanished, so also had the ideas he brought with him from the provinces;\r\nhe had returned thither with an intelligence developed, with loftier\r\nambitions, and saw things as they were at home in the old manor house.\r\nHis father and mother, his two brothers and two sisters, with an aged\r\naunt, whose whole fortune consisted in annuities, lived on the little\r\nestate of Rastignac. The whole property brought in about three thousand\r\nfrancs; and though the amount varied with the season (as must always\r\nbe the case in a vine-growing district), they were obliged to spare an\r\nunvarying twelve hundred francs out of their income for him. He saw\r\nhow constantly the poverty, which they had generously hidden from him,\r\nweighed upon them; he could not help comparing the sisters, who had\r\nseemed so beautiful to his boyish eyes, with women in Paris, who had\r\nrealized the beauty of his dreams. The uncertain future of the whole\r\nfamily depended upon him. It did not escape his eyes that not a crumb\r\nwas wasted in the house, nor that the wine they drank was made from the\r\nsecond pressing; a multitude of small things, which it is useless to\r\nspeak of in detail here, made him burn to distinguish himself, and his\r\nambition to succeed increased tenfold.\r\n\r\nHe meant, like all great souls, that his success should be owing\r\nentirely to his merits; but his was pre-eminently a southern\r\ntemperament, the execution of his plans was sure to be marred by the\r\nvertigo that seizes on youth when youth sees itself alone in a wide sea,\r\nuncertain how to spend its energies, whither to steer its course, how\r\nto adapt its sails to the winds. At first he determined to fling himself\r\nheart and soul into his work, but he was diverted from this purpose by\r\nthe need of society and connections; then he saw how great an influence\r\nwomen exert in social life, and suddenly made up his mind to go out\r\ninto this world to seek a protectress there. Surely a clever and\r\nhigh-spirited young man, whose wit and courage were set off to advantage\r\nby a graceful figure and the vigorous kind of beauty that readily\r\nstrikes a woman’s imagination, need not despair of finding a\r\nprotectress. These ideas occurred to him in his country walks with his\r\nsisters, whom he had once joined so gaily. The girls thought him very\r\nmuch changed.\r\n\r\nHis aunt, Mme. de Marcillac, had been presented at court, and had moved\r\namong the brightest heights of that lofty region. Suddenly the young\r\nman’s ambition discerned in those recollections of hers, which had been\r\nlike nursery fairy tales to her nephews and nieces, the elements of\r\na social success at least as important as the success which he had\r\nachieved at the Ecole de Droit. He began to ask his aunt about those\r\nrelations; some of the old ties might still hold good. After much\r\nshaking of the branches of the family tree, the old lady came to the\r\nconclusion that of all persons who could be useful to her nephew among\r\nthe selfish genus of rich relations, the Vicomtesse de Beauseant was\r\nthe least likely to refuse. To this lady, therefore, she wrote in the\r\nold-fashioned style, recommending Eugene to her; pointing out to\r\nher nephew that if he succeeded in pleasing Mme. de Beauseant, the\r\nVicomtesse would introduce him to other relations. A few days after his\r\nreturn to Paris, therefore, Rastignac sent his aunt’s letter to Mme.\r\nde Beauseant. The Vicomtesse replied by an invitation to a ball for\r\nthe following evening. This was the position of affairs at the Maison\r\nVauquer at the end of November 1819.\r\n\r\nA few days later, after Mme. de Beauseant’s ball, Eugene came in at two\r\no’clock in the morning. The persevering student meant to make up for the\r\nlost time by working until daylight. It was the first time that he had\r\nattempted to spend the night in this way in that silent quarter. The\r\nspell of a factitious energy was upon him; he had beheld the pomp and\r\nsplendor of the world. He had not dined at the Maison Vauquer; the\r\nboarders probably would think that he would walk home at daybreak from\r\nthe dance, as he had done sometimes on former occasions, after a fete at\r\nthe Prado, or a ball at the Odeon, splashing his silk stockings thereby,\r\nand ruining his pumps.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that Christophe took a look into the street before\r\ndrawing the bolts of the door; and Rastignac, coming in at that\r\nmoment, could go up to his room without making any noise, followed by\r\nChristophe, who made a great deal. Eugene exchanged his dress suit for a\r\nshabby overcoat and slippers, kindled a fire with some blocks of patent\r\nfuel, and prepared for his night’s work in such a sort that the faint\r\nsounds he made were drowned by Christophe’s heavy tramp on the stairs.\r\n\r\nEugene sat absorbed in thought for a few moments before plunging into\r\nhis law books. He had just become aware of the fact that the Vicomtesse\r\nde Beauseant was one of the queens of fashion, that her house was\r\nthought to be the pleasantest in the Faubourg Saint-Germain. And not\r\nonly so, she was, by right of her fortune, and the name she bore, one of\r\nthe most conspicuous figures in that aristocratic world. Thanks to the\r\naunt, thanks to Mme. de Marcillac’s letter of introduction, the poor\r\nstudent had been kindly received in that house before he knew the extent\r\nof the favor thus shown to him. It was almost like a patent of nobility\r\nto be admitted to those gilded salons; he had appeared in the most\r\nexclusive circle in Paris, and now all doors were open for him. Eugene\r\nhad been dazzled at first by the brilliant assembly, and had scarcely\r\nexchanged a few words with the Vicomtesse; he had been content to single\r\nout a goddess among this throng of Parisian divinities, one of those\r\nwomen who are sure to attract a young man’s fancy.\r\n\r\nThe Comtesse Anastasie de Restaud was tall and gracefully made; she\r\nhad one of the prettiest figures in Paris. Imagine a pair of great dark\r\neyes, a magnificently moulded hand, a shapely foot. There was a fiery\r\nenergy in her movements; the Marquis de Ronquerolles had called her “a\r\nthoroughbred,” “a pure pedigree,” these figures of speech have replaced\r\nthe “heavenly angel” and Ossianic nomenclature; the old mythology of\r\nlove is extinct, doomed to perish by modern dandyism. But for Rastignac,\r\nMme. Anastasie de Restaud was the woman for whom he had sighed. He had\r\ncontrived to write his name twice upon the list of partners upon her\r\nfan, and had snatched a few words with her during the first quadrille.\r\n\r\n“Where shall I meet you again, Madame?” he asked abruptly, and the tones\r\nof his voice were full of the vehement energy that women like so well.\r\n\r\n“Oh, everywhere!” said she, “in the Bois, at the Bouffons, in my own\r\nhouse.”\r\n\r\nWith the impetuosity of his adventurous southern temper, he did all he\r\ncould to cultivate an acquaintance with this lovely countess, making the\r\nbest of his opportunities in the quadrille and during a waltz that she\r\ngave him. When he told her that he was a cousin of Mme. de Beauseant’s,\r\nthe Countess, whom he took for a great lady, asked him to call at her\r\nhouse, and after her parting smile, Rastignac felt convinced that he\r\nmust make this visit. He was so lucky as to light upon some one who did\r\nnot laugh at his ignorance, a fatal defect among the gilded and insolent\r\nyouth of that period; the coterie of Maulincourts, Maximes de Trailles,\r\nde Marsays, Ronquerolles, Ajuda-Pintos, and Vandenesses who shone there\r\nin all the glory of coxcombry among the best-dressed women of fashion\r\nin Paris--Lady Brandon, the Duchesse de Langeais, the Comtesse de\r\nKergarouet, Mme. de Serizy, the Duchesse de Carigliano, the Comtesse\r\nFerraud, Mme. de Lanty, the Marquise d’Aiglemont, Mme. Firmiani,\r\nthe Marquise de Listomere and the Marquise d’Espard, the Duchesse de\r\nMaufrigneuse and the Grandlieus. Luckily, therefore, for him, the novice\r\nhappened upon the Marquis de Montriveau, the lover of the Duchesse de\r\nLangeais, a general as simple as a child; from him Rastignac learned\r\nthat the Comtesse lived in the Rue du Helder.\r\n\r\nAh, what it is to be young, eager to see the world, greedily on the\r\nwatch for any chance that brings you nearer the woman of your dreams,\r\nand behold two houses open their doors to you! To set foot in the\r\nVicomtesse de Beauseant’s house in the Faubourg Saint-Germain; to fall\r\non your knees before a Comtesse de Restaud in the Chaussee d’Antin;\r\nto look at one glance across a vista of Paris drawing-rooms, conscious\r\nthat, possessing sufficient good looks, you may hope to find aid and\r\nprotection there in a feminine heart! To feel ambitious enough to spurn\r\nthe tight-rope on which you must walk with the steady head of an acrobat\r\nfor whom a fall is impossible, and to find in a charming woman the best\r\nof all balancing poles.\r\n\r\nHe sat there with his thoughts for a while, Law on the one hand, and\r\nPoverty on the other, beholding a radiant vision of a woman rise above\r\nthe dull, smouldering fire. Who would not have paused and questioned\r\nthe future as Eugene was doing? who would not have pictured it full of\r\nsuccess? His wondering thoughts took wings; he was transported out\r\nof the present into that blissful future; he was sitting by Mme. de\r\nRestaud’s side, when a sort of sigh, like the grunt of an overburdened\r\nSt. Joseph, broke the silence of the night. It vibrated through the\r\nstudent, who took the sound for a death groan. He opened his door\r\nnoiselessly, went out upon the landing, and saw a thin streak of light\r\nunder Father Goriot’s door. Eugene feared that his neighbor had been\r\ntaken ill; he went over and looked through the keyhole; the old man\r\nwas busily engaged in an occupation so singular and so suspicious that\r\nRastignac thought he was only doing a piece of necessary service\r\nto society to watch the self-styled vermicelli maker’s nocturnal\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\nThe table was upturned, and Goriot had doubtless in some way secured a\r\nsilver plate and cup to the bar before knotting a thick rope round them;\r\nhe was pulling at this rope with such enormous force that they were\r\nbeing crushed and twisted out of shape; to all appearance he meant to\r\nconvert the richly wrought metal into ingots.\r\n\r\n“_Peste!_ what a man!” said Rastignac, as he watched Goriot’s muscular\r\narms; there was not a sound in the room while the old man, with the aid\r\nof the rope, was kneading the silver like dough. “Was he then, indeed,\r\na thief, or a receiver of stolen goods, who affected imbecility and\r\ndecrepitude, and lived like a beggar that he might carry on his pursuits\r\nthe more securely?” Eugene stood for a moment revolving these questions,\r\nthen he looked again through the keyhole.\r\n\r\nFather Goriot had unwound his coil of rope; he had covered the table\r\nwith a blanket, and was now employed in rolling the flattened mass\r\nof silver into a bar, an operation which he performed with marvelous\r\ndexterity.\r\n\r\n“Why, he must be as strong as Augustus, King of Poland!” said Eugene to\r\nhimself when the bar was nearly finished.\r\n\r\nFather Goriot looked sadly at his handiwork, tears fell from his\r\neyes, he blew out the dip which had served him for a light while he\r\nmanipulated the silver, and Eugene heard him sigh as he lay down again.\r\n\r\n“He is mad,” thought the student.\r\n\r\n“_Poor child!_” Father Goriot said aloud. Rastignac, hearing those\r\nwords, concluded to keep silence; he would not hastily condemn his\r\nneighbor. He was just in the doorway of his room when a strange sound\r\nfrom the staircase below reached his ears; it might have been made\r\nby two men coming up in list slippers. Eugene listened; two men there\r\ncertainly were, he could hear their breathing. Yet there had been no\r\nsound of opening the street door, no footsteps in the passage. Suddenly,\r\ntoo, he saw a faint gleam of light on the second story; it came from M.\r\nVautrin’s room.\r\n\r\n“There are a good many mysteries here for a lodging-house!” he said to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nHe went part of the way downstairs and listened again. The rattle of\r\ngold reached his ears. In another moment the light was put out, and\r\nagain he distinctly heard the breathing of two men, but no sound of a\r\ndoor being opened or shut. The two men went downstairs, the faint sounds\r\ngrowing fainter as they went.\r\n\r\n“Who is there?” cried Mme. Vauquer out of her bedroom window.\r\n\r\n“I, Mme. Vauquer,” answered Vautrin’s deep bass voice. “I am coming in.”\r\n\r\n“That is odd! Christophe drew the bolts,” said Eugene, going back to his\r\nroom. “You have to sit up at night, it seems, if you really mean to know\r\nall that is going on about you in Paris.”\r\n\r\nThese incidents turned his thought from his ambitious dreams; he betook\r\nhimself to his work, but his thought wandered back to Father Goriot’s\r\nsuspicious occupation; Mme. de Restaud’s face swam again and again\r\nbefore his eyes like a vision of a brilliant future; and at last he lay\r\ndown and slept with clenched fists. When a young man makes up his mind\r\nthat he will work all night, the chances are that seven times out of\r\nten he will sleep till morning. Such vigils do not begin before we are\r\nturned twenty.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Paris was wrapped in one of the dense fogs that throw\r\nthe most punctual people out in their calculations as to the time; even\r\nthe most business-like folk fail to keep their appointments in such\r\nweather, and ordinary mortals wake up at noon and fancy it is eight\r\no’clock. On this morning it was half-past nine, and Mme. Vauquer\r\nstill lay abed. Christophe was late, Sylvie was late, but the two sat\r\ncomfortably taking their coffee as usual. It was Sylvie’s custom to take\r\nthe cream off the milk destined for the boarders’ breakfast for her\r\nown, and to boil the remainder for some time, so that madame should not\r\ndiscover this illegal exaction.\r\n\r\n“Sylvie,” said Christophe, as he dipped a piece of toast into the\r\ncoffee, “M. Vautrin, who is not such a bad sort, all the same, had two\r\npeople come to see him again last night. If madame says anything, mind\r\nyou say nothing about it.”\r\n\r\n“Has he given you something?”\r\n\r\n“He gave me a five-franc piece this month, which is as good as saying,\r\n‘Hold your tongue.’”\r\n\r\n“Except him and Mme. Couture, who doesn’t look twice at every penny,\r\nthere’s no one in the house that doesn’t try to get back with the left\r\nhand all that they give with the right at New Year,” said Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“And, after all,” said Christophe, “what do they give you? A miserable\r\nfive-franc piece. There is Father Goriot, who has cleaned his shoes\r\nhimself these two years past. There is that old beggar Poiret, who goes\r\nwithout blacking altogether; he would sooner drink it than put it on his\r\nboots. Then there is that whipper-snapper of a student, who gives me a\r\ncouple of francs. Two francs will not pay for my brushes, and he sells\r\nhis old clothes, and gets more for them than they are worth. Oh! they’re\r\na shabby lot!”\r\n\r\n“Pooh!” said Sylvie, sipping her coffee, “our places are the best in the\r\nQuarter, that I know. But about that great big chap Vautrin, Christophe;\r\nhas any one told you anything about him?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I met a gentleman in the street a few days ago; he said to me,\r\n‘There’s a gentleman in your place, isn’t there? a tall man that dyes\r\nhis whiskers?’ I told him, ‘No, sir; they aren’t dyed. A gay fellow\r\nlike him hasn’t the time to do it.’ And when I told M. Vautrin about\r\nit afterwards, he said, ‘Quite right, my boy. That is the way to\r\nanswer them. There is nothing more unpleasant than to have your little\r\nweaknesses known; it might spoil many a match.’”\r\n\r\n“Well, and for my part,” said Sylvie, “a man tried to humbug me at the\r\nmarket wanting to know if I had seen him put on his shirt. Such bosh!\r\nThere,” she cried, interrupting herself, “that’s a quarter to ten\r\nstriking at the Val-de-Grace, and not a soul stirring!”\r\n\r\n“Pooh! they are all gone out. Mme. Couture and the girl went out at\r\neight o’clock to take the wafer at Saint-Etienne. Father Goriot started\r\noff somewhere with a parcel, and the student won’t be back from his\r\nlecture till ten o’clock. I saw them go while I was sweeping the stairs;\r\nFather Goriot knocked up against me, and his parcel was as hard as iron.\r\nWhat is the old fellow up to, I wonder? He is as good as a plaything for\r\nthe rest of them; they can never let him alone; but he is a good man,\r\nall the same, and worth more than all of them put together. He doesn’t\r\ngive you much himself, but he sometimes sends you with a message to\r\nladies who fork out famous tips; they are dressed grandly, too.”\r\n\r\n“His daughters, as he calls them, eh? There are a dozen of them.”\r\n\r\n“I have never been to more than two--the two who came here.”\r\n\r\n“There is madame moving overhead; I shall have to go, or she will raise\r\na fine racket. Just keep an eye on the milk, Christophe; don’t let the\r\ncat get at it.”\r\n\r\nSylvie went up to her mistress’ room.\r\n\r\n“Sylvie! How is this? It’s nearly ten o’clock, and you let me sleep like\r\na dormouse! Such a thing has never happened before.”\r\n\r\n“It’s the fog; it is that thick, you could cut it with a knife.”\r\n\r\n“But how about breakfast?”\r\n\r\n“Bah! the boarders are possessed, I’m sure. They all cleared out before\r\nthere was a wink of daylight.”\r\n\r\n“Do speak properly, Sylvie,” Mme. Vauquer retorted; “say a blink of\r\ndaylight.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, well, madame, whichever you please. Anyhow, you can have breakfast\r\nat ten o’clock. La Michonnette and Poiret have neither of them stirred.\r\nThere are only those two upstairs, and they are sleeping like the logs\r\nthey are.”\r\n\r\n“But, Sylvie, you put their names together as if----”\r\n\r\n“As if what?” said Sylvie, bursting into a guffaw. “The two of them make\r\na pair.”\r\n\r\n“It is a strange thing, isn’t it, Sylvie, how M. Vautrin got in last\r\nnight after Christophe had bolted the door?”\r\n\r\n“Not at all, madame. Christophe heard M. Vautrin, and went down and\r\nundid the door. And here are you imagining that----?”\r\n\r\n“Give me my bodice, and be quick and get breakfast ready. Dish up the\r\nrest of the mutton with the potatoes, and you can put the stewed pears\r\non the table, those at five a penny.”\r\n\r\nA few moments later Mme. Vauquer came down, just in time to see the cat\r\nknock down a plate that covered a bowl of milk, and begin to lap in all\r\nhaste.\r\n\r\n“Mistigris!” she cried.\r\n\r\nThe cat fled, but promptly returned to rub against her ankles.\r\n\r\n“Oh! yes, you can wheedle, you old hypocrite!” she said. “Sylvie!\r\nSylvie!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, madame; what is it?”\r\n\r\n“Just see what the cat has done!”\r\n\r\n“It is all that stupid Christophe’s fault. I told him to stop and lay\r\nthe table. What has become of him? Don’t you worry, madame; Father\r\nGoriot shall have it. I will fill it up with water, and he won’t know\r\nthe difference; he never notices anything, not even what he eats.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder where the old heathen can have gone?” said Mme. Vauquer,\r\nsetting the plates round the table.\r\n\r\n“Who knows? He is up to all sorts of tricks.”\r\n\r\n“I have overslept myself,” said Mme. Vauquer.\r\n\r\n“But madame looks as fresh as a rose, all the same.”\r\n\r\nThe door bell rang at that moment, and Vautrin came through the\r\nsitting-room, singing loudly:\r\n\r\n  “‘Tis the same old story everywhere,\r\n   A roving heart and a roving glance..\r\n\r\n“Oh! Mamma Vauquer! good-morning!” he cried at the sight of his hostess,\r\nand he put his arm gaily round her waist.\r\n\r\n“There! have done----”\r\n\r\n“‘Impertinence!’ Say it!” he answered. “Come, say it! Now, isn’t that\r\nwhat you really mean? Stop a bit, I will help you to set the table. Ah!\r\nI am a nice man, am I not?\r\n\r\n  “For the locks of brown and the golden hair\r\n     A sighing lover...\r\n\r\n“Oh! I have just seen something so funny----\r\n\r\n                  .... led by chance.”\r\n\r\n“What?” asked the widow.\r\n\r\n“Father Goriot in the goldsmith’s shop in the Rue Dauphine at half-past\r\neight this morning. They buy old spoons and forks and gold lace there,\r\nand Goriot sold a piece of silver plate for a good round sum. It had\r\nbeen twisted out of shape very neatly for a man that’s not used to the\r\ntrade.”\r\n\r\n“Really? You don’t say so?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. One of my friends is expatriating himself; I had been to see him\r\noff on board the Royal Mail steamer, and was coming back here. I waited\r\nafter that to see what Father Goriot would do; it is a comical affair.\r\nHe came back to this quarter of the world, to the Rue des Gres, and went\r\ninto a money-lender’s house; everybody knows him, Gobseck, a stuck-up\r\nrascal, that would make dominoes out of his father’s bones, a Turk,\r\na heathen, an old Jew, a Greek; it would be a difficult matter to rob\r\n_him_, for he puts all his coin into the Bank.”\r\n\r\n“Then what was Father Goriot doing there?”\r\n\r\n“Doing?” said Vautrin. “Nothing; he was bent on his own undoing. He is a\r\nsimpleton, stupid enough to ruin himself by running after----”\r\n\r\n“There he is!” cried Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“Christophe,” cried Father Goriot’s voice, “come upstairs with me.”\r\n\r\nChristophe went up, and shortly afterwards came down again.\r\n\r\n“Where are you going?” Mme. Vauquer asked of her servant.\r\n\r\n“Out on an errand for M. Goriot.”\r\n\r\n“What may that be?” said Vautrin, pouncing on a letter in Christophe’s\r\nhand. “_Mme. la Comtesse Anastasie de Restaud_,” he read. “Where are you\r\ngoing with it?” he added, as he gave the letter back to Christophe.\r\n\r\n“To the Rue du Helder. I have orders to give this into her hands\r\nmyself.”\r\n\r\n“What is there inside it?” said Vautrin, holding the letter up to the\r\nlight. “A banknote? No.” He peered into the envelope. “A receipted\r\naccount!” he cried. “My word! ‘tis a gallant old dotard. Off with you,\r\nold chap,” he said, bringing down a hand on Christophe’s head, and\r\nspinning the man round like a thimble; “you will have a famous tip.”\r\n\r\nBy this time the table was set. Sylvie was boiling the milk, Mme.\r\nVauquer was lighting a fire in the stove with some assistance from\r\nVautrin, who kept humming to himself:\r\n\r\n  “The same old story everywhere,\r\n   A roving heart and a roving glance.”\r\n\r\nWhen everything was ready, Mme. Couture and Mlle. Taillefer came in.\r\n\r\n“Where have you been this morning, fair lady?” said Mme. Vauquer,\r\nturning to Mme. Couture.\r\n\r\n“We have just been to say our prayers at Saint-Etienne du Mont. To-day\r\nis the day when we must go to see M. Taillefer. Poor little thing! She\r\nis trembling like a leaf,” Mme. Couture went on, as she seated herself\r\nbefore the fire and held the steaming soles of her boots to the blaze.\r\n\r\n“Warm yourself, Victorine,” said Mme. Vauquer.\r\n\r\n“It is quite right and proper, mademoiselle, to pray to Heaven to soften\r\nyour father’s heart,” said Vautrin, as he drew a chair nearer to the\r\norphan girl; “but that is not enough. What you want is a friend who\r\nwill give the monster a piece of his mind; a barbarian that has three\r\nmillions (so they say), and will not give you a dowry; and a pretty girl\r\nneeds a dowry nowadays.”\r\n\r\n“Poor child!” said Mme. Vauquer. “Never mind, my pet, your wretch of a\r\nfather is going just the way to bring trouble upon himself.”\r\n\r\nVictorine’s eyes filled with tears at the words, and the widow checked\r\nherself at a sign from Mme. Couture.\r\n\r\n“If we could only see him!” said the Commissary-General’s widow; “if I\r\ncould speak to him myself and give him his wife’s last letter! I\r\nhave never dared to run the risk of sending it by post; he knew my\r\nhandwriting----”\r\n\r\n“‘Oh woman, persecuted and injured innocent!’” exclaimed Vautrin,\r\nbreaking in upon her. “So that is how you are, is it? In a few days’\r\ntime I will look into your affairs, and it will be all right, you shall\r\nsee.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! sir,” said Victorine, with a tearful but eager glance at Vautrin,\r\nwho showed no sign of being touched by it, “if you know of any way\r\nof communicating with my father, please be sure and tell him that his\r\naffection and my mother’s honor are more to me than all the money in the\r\nworld. If you can induce him to relent a little towards me, I will pray\r\nto God for you. You may be sure of my gratitude----”\r\n\r\n“_The same old story everywhere_,” sang Vautrin, with a satirical\r\nintonation. At this juncture, Goriot, Mlle. Michonneau, and Poiret came\r\ndownstairs together; possibly the scent of the gravy which Sylvie was\r\nmaking to serve with the mutton had announced breakfast. The seven\r\npeople thus assembled bade each other good-morning, and took their\r\nplaces at the table; the clock struck ten, and the student’s footstep\r\nwas heard outside.\r\n\r\n“Ah! here you are, M. Eugene,” said Sylvie; “every one is breakfasting\r\nat home to-day.”\r\n\r\nThe student exchanged greetings with the lodgers, and sat down beside\r\nGoriot.\r\n\r\n“I have just met with a queer adventure,” he said, as he helped himself\r\nabundantly to the mutton, and cut a slice of bread, which Mme. Vauquer’s\r\neyes gauged as usual.\r\n\r\n“An adventure?” queried Poiret.\r\n\r\n“Well, and what is there to astonish you in that, old boy?” Vautrin\r\nasked of Poiret. “M. Eugene is cut out for that kind of thing.”\r\n\r\nMlle. Taillefer stole a timid glance at the young student.\r\n\r\n“Tell us about your adventure!” demanded M. Vautrin.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday evening I went to a ball given by a cousin of mine, the\r\nVicomtesse de Beauseant. She has a magnificent house; the rooms are hung\r\nwith silk--in short, it was a splendid affair, and I was as happy as a\r\nking---”\r\n\r\n“Fisher,” put in Vautrin, interrupting.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean, sir?” said Eugene sharply.\r\n\r\n“I said ‘fisher,’ because kingfishers see a good deal more fun than\r\nkings.”\r\n\r\n“Quite true; I would much rather be the little careless bird than a\r\nking,” said Poiret the ditto-ist, “because----”\r\n\r\n“In fact”--the law-student cut him short--“I danced with one of the\r\nhandsomest women in the room, a charming countess, the most exquisite\r\ncreature I have ever seen. There was peach blossom in her hair, and she\r\nhad the loveliest bouquet of flowers--real flowers, that scented the\r\nair----but there! it is no use trying to describe a woman glowing with\r\nthe dance. You ought to have seen her! Well, and this morning I met this\r\ndivine countess about nine o’clock, on foot in the Rue de Gres. Oh! how\r\nmy heart beat! I began to think----”\r\n\r\n“That she was coming here,” said Vautrin, with a keen look at the\r\nstudent. “I expect that she was going to call on old Gobseck, a\r\nmoney-lender. If ever you explore a Parisian woman’s heart, you will\r\nfind the money-lender first, and the lover afterwards. Your countess is\r\ncalled Anastasie de Restaud, and she lives in the Rue du Helder.”\r\n\r\nThe student stared hard at Vautrin. Father Goriot raised his head at the\r\nwords, and gave the two speakers a glance so full of intelligence and\r\nuneasiness that the lodgers beheld him with astonishment.\r\n\r\n“Then Christophe was too late, and she must have gone to him!” cried\r\nGoriot, with anguish in his voice.\r\n\r\n“It is just as I guessed,” said Vautrin, leaning over to whisper in Mme.\r\nVauquer’s ear.\r\n\r\nGoriot went on with his breakfast, but seemed unconscious of what he was\r\ndoing. He had never looked more stupid nor more taken up with his own\r\nthoughts than he did at that moment.\r\n\r\n“Who the devil could have told you her name, M. Vautrin?” asked Eugene.\r\n\r\n“Aha! there you are!” answered Vautrin. “Old Father Goriot there knew it\r\nquite well! and why should I not know it too?”\r\n\r\n“M. Goriot?” the student cried.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” asked the old man. “So she was very beautiful, was she,\r\nyesterday night?”\r\n\r\n“Who?”\r\n\r\n“Mme. de Restaud.”\r\n\r\n“Look at the old wretch,” said Mme. Vauquer, speaking to Vautrin; “how\r\nhis eyes light up!”\r\n\r\n“Then does he really keep her?” said Mlle. Michonneau, in a whisper to\r\nthe student.\r\n\r\n“Oh! yes, she was tremendously pretty,” Eugene answered. Father Goriot\r\nwatched him with eager eyes. “If Mme. de Beauseant had not been there,\r\nmy divine countess would have been the queen of the ball; none of the\r\nyounger men had eyes for any one else. I was the twelfth on her list,\r\nand she danced every quadrille. The other women were furious. She must\r\nhave enjoyed herself, if ever creature did! It is a true saying\r\nthat there is no more beautiful sight than a frigate in full sail, a\r\ngalloping horse, or a woman dancing.”\r\n\r\n“So the wheel turns,” said Vautrin; “yesterday night at a duchess’\r\nball, this morning in a money-lender’s office, on the lowest rung of the\r\nladder--just like a Parisienne! If their husbands cannot afford to pay\r\nfor their frantic extravagance, they will sell themselves. Or if\r\nthey cannot do that, they will tear out their mothers’ hearts to find\r\nsomething to pay for their splendor. They will turn the world upside\r\ndown. Just a Parisienne through and through!”\r\n\r\nFather Goriot’s face, which had shone at the student’s words like the\r\nsun on a bright day, clouded over all at once at this cruel speech of\r\nVautrin’s.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Mme. Vauquer, “but where is your adventure? Did you speak\r\nto her? Did you ask her if she wanted to study law?”\r\n\r\n“She did not see me,” said Eugene. “But only think of meeting one of the\r\nprettiest women in Paris in the Rue des Gres at nine o’clock! She could\r\nnot have reached home after the ball till two o’clock this morning.\r\nWasn’t it queer? There is no place like Paris for this sort of\r\nadventures.”\r\n\r\n“Pshaw! much funnier things than _that_ happen here!” exclaimed Vautrin.\r\n\r\nMlle. Taillefer had scarcely heeded the talk, she was so absorbed by the\r\nthought of the new attempt that she was about to make. Mme. Couture made\r\na sign that it was time to go upstairs and dress; the two ladies went\r\nout, and Father Goriot followed their example.\r\n\r\n“Well, did you see?” said Mme. Vauquer, addressing Vautrin and the rest\r\nof the circle. “He is ruining himself for those women, that is plain.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing will ever make me believe that that beautiful Comtesse de\r\nRestaud is anything to Father Goriot,” cried the student.\r\n\r\n“Well, and if you don’t,” broke in Vautrin, “we are not set on\r\nconvincing you. You are too young to know Paris thoroughly yet; later on\r\nyou will find out that there are what we call men with a passion----”\r\n\r\nMlle. Michonneau gave Vautrin a quick glance at these words. They seemed\r\nto be like the sound of a trumpet to a trooper’s horse. “Aha!” said\r\nVautrin, stopping in his speech to give her a searching glance, “so we\r\nhave had our little experiences, have we?”\r\n\r\nThe old maid lowered her eyes like a nun who sees a statue.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he went on, “when folk of that kind get a notion into their\r\nheads, they cannot drop it. They must drink the water from some\r\nparticular spring--it is stagnant as often as not; but they will sell\r\ntheir wives and families, they will sell their own souls to the devil to\r\nget it. For some this spring is play, or the stock-exchange, or music,\r\nor a collection of pictures or insects; for others it is some woman who\r\ncan give them the dainties they like. You might offer these last all the\r\nwomen on earth--they would turn up their noses; they will have the only\r\none who can gratify their passion. It often happens that the woman\r\ndoes not care for them at all, and treats them cruelly; they buy their\r\nmorsels of satisfaction very dear; but no matter, the fools are never\r\ntired of it; they will take their last blanket to the pawnbroker’s to\r\ngive their last five-franc piece to her. Father Goriot here is one of\r\nthat sort. He is discreet, so the Countess exploits him--just the way of\r\nthe gay world. The poor old fellow thinks of her and of nothing else.\r\nIn all other respects you see he is a stupid animal; but get him on\r\nthat subject, and his eyes sparkle like diamonds. That secret is not\r\ndifficult to guess. He took some plate himself this morning to the\r\nmelting-pot, and I saw him at Daddy Gobseck’s in the Rue des Gres. And\r\nnow, mark what follows--he came back here, and gave a letter for the\r\nComtesse de Restaud to that noodle of a Christophe, who showed us the\r\naddress; there was a receipted bill inside it. It is clear that it was\r\nan urgent matter if the Countess also went herself to the old money\r\nlender. Father Goriot has financed her handsomely. There is no need to\r\ntack a tale together; the thing is self-evident. So that shows you, sir\r\nstudent, that all the time your Countess was smiling, dancing, flirting,\r\nswaying her peach-flower crowned head, with her gown gathered into her\r\nhand, her slippers were pinching her, as they say; she was thinking of\r\nher protested bills, or her lover’s protested bills.”\r\n\r\n“You have made me wild to know the truth,” cried Eugene; “I will go to\r\ncall on Mme. de Restaud to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” echoed Poiret; “you must go and call on Mme. de Restaud.”\r\n\r\n“And perhaps you will find Father Goriot there, who will take payment\r\nfor the assistance he politely rendered.”\r\n\r\nEugene looked disgusted. “Why, then, this Paris of yours is a slough.”\r\n\r\n“And an uncommonly queer slough, too,” replied Vautrin. “The mud\r\nsplashes you as you drive through it in your carriage--you are a\r\nrespectable person; you go afoot and are splashed--you are a scoundrel.\r\nYou are so unlucky as to walk off with something or other belonging\r\nto somebody else, and they exhibit you as a curiosity in the Place du\r\nPalais-de-Justice; you steal a million, and you are pointed out in every\r\nsalon as a model of virtue. And you pay thirty millions for the police\r\nand the courts of justice, for the maintenance of law and order! A\r\npretty slate of things it is!”\r\n\r\n“What,” cried Mme. Vauquer, “has Father Goriot really melted down his\r\nsilver posset-dish?”\r\n\r\n“There were two turtle-doves on the lid, were there not?” asked Eugene.\r\n\r\n“Yes, that there were.”\r\n\r\n“Then, was he fond of it?” said Eugene. “He cried while he was breaking\r\nup the cup and plate. I happened to see him by accident.”\r\n\r\n“It was dear to him as his own life,” answered the widow.\r\n\r\n“There! you see how infatuated the old fellow is!” cried Vautrin. “The\r\nwoman yonder can coax the soul out of him.”\r\n\r\nThe student went up to his room. Vautrin went out, and a few moments\r\nlater Mme. Couture and Victorine drove away in a cab which Sylvie had\r\ncalled for them. Poiret gave his arm to Mlle. Michonneau, and they went\r\ntogether to spend the two sunniest hours of the day in the Jardin des\r\nPlantes.\r\n\r\n“Well, those two are as good as married,” was the portly Sylvie’s\r\ncomment. “They are going out together to-day for the first time. They\r\nare such a couple of dry sticks that if they happen to strike against\r\neach other they will draw sparks like flint and steel.”\r\n\r\n“Keep clear of Mlle. Michonneau’s shawl, then,” said Mme. Vauquer,\r\nlaughing; “it would flare up like tinder.”\r\n\r\nAt four o’clock that evening, when Goriot came in, he saw, by the light\r\nof two smoky lamps, that Victorine’s eyes were red. Mme. Vauquer was\r\nlistening to the history of the visit made that morning to M. Taillefer;\r\nit had been made in vain. Taillefer was tired of the annual application\r\nmade by his daughter and her elderly friend; he gave them a personal\r\ninterview in order to arrive at an understanding with them.\r\n\r\n“My dear lady,” said Mme. Couture, addressing Mme. Vauquer, “just\r\nimagine it; he did not even ask Victorine to sit down, she was standing\r\nthe whole time. He said to me quite coolly, without putting himself in a\r\npassion, that we might spare ourselves the trouble of going there; that\r\nthe young lady (he would not call her his daughter) was injuring her\r\ncause by importuning him (_importuning!_ once a year, the wretch!); that\r\nas Victorine’s mother had nothing when he married her, Victorine ought\r\nnot to expect anything from him; in fact, he said the most cruel things,\r\nthat made the poor child burst out crying. The little thing threw\r\nherself at her father’s feet and spoke up bravely; she said that she\r\nonly persevered in her visits for her mother’s sake; that she would\r\nobey him without a murmur, but that she begged him to read her poor dead\r\nmother’s farewell letter. She took it up and gave it to him, saying the\r\nmost beautiful things in the world, most beautifully expressed; I do not\r\nknow where she learned them; God must have put them into her head, for\r\nthe poor child was inspired to speak so nicely that it made me cry like\r\na fool to hear her talk. And what do you think the monster was doing all\r\nthe time? Cutting his nails! He took the letter that poor Mme. Taillefer\r\nhad soaked with tears, and flung it on to the chimney-piece. ‘That is\r\nall right,’ he said. He held out his hands to raise his daughter, but\r\nshe covered them with kisses, and he drew them away again. Scandalous,\r\nisn’t it? And his great booby of a son came in and took no notice of his\r\nsister.”\r\n\r\n“What inhuman wretches they must be!” said Father Goriot.\r\n\r\n“And then they both went out of the room,” Mme. Couture went on, without\r\nheeding the worthy vermicelli maker’s exclamation; “father and son bowed\r\nto me, and asked me to excuse them on account of urgent business! That\r\nis the history of our call. Well, he has seen his daughter at any rate.\r\nHow he can refuse to acknowledge her I cannot think, for they are as\r\nalike as two peas.”\r\n\r\nThe boarders dropped in one after another, interchanging greetings and\r\nempty jokes that certain classes of Parisians regard as humorous and\r\nwitty. Dulness is their prevailing ingredient, and the whole point\r\nconsists in mispronouncing a word or a gesture. This kind of argot is\r\nalways changing. The essence of the jest consists in some catchword\r\nsuggested by a political event, an incident in the police courts, a\r\nstreet song, or a bit of burlesque at some theatre, and forgotten in a\r\nmonth. Anything and everything serves to keep up a game of battledore\r\nand shuttlecock with words and ideas. The diorama, a recent invention,\r\nwhich carried an optical illusion a degree further than panoramas, had\r\ngiven rise to a mania among art students for ending every word with\r\n_rama_. The Maison Vauquer had caught the infection from a young artist\r\namong the boarders.\r\n\r\n“Well, Monsieur-r-r Poiret,” said the _employe_ from the Museum, “how\r\nis your health-orama?” Then, without waiting for an answer, he turned to\r\nMme. Couture and Victorine with a “Ladies, you seem melancholy.”\r\n\r\n“Is dinner ready?” cried Horace Bianchon, a medical student, and a\r\nfriend of Rastignac’s; “my stomach is sinking _usque ad talones_.”\r\n\r\n“There is an uncommon _frozerama_ outside,” said Vautrin. “Make room\r\nthere, Father Goriot! Confound it, your foot covers the whole front of\r\nthe stove.”\r\n\r\n“Illustrious M. Vautrin,” put in Bianchon, “why do you say _frozerama_?\r\nIt is incorrect; it should be _frozenrama_.”\r\n\r\n“No, it shouldn’t,” said the official from the Museum; “_frozerama_ is\r\nright by the same rule that you say ‘My feet are _froze_.’”\r\n\r\n“Ah! ah!”\r\n\r\n“Here is his Excellency the Marquis de Rastignac, Doctor of the Law of\r\nContraries,” cried Bianchon, seizing Eugene by the throat, and almost\r\nthrottling him.\r\n\r\n“Hallo there! hallo!”\r\n\r\nMlle. Michonneau came noiselessly in, bowed to the rest of the party,\r\nand took her place beside the three women without saying a word.\r\n\r\n“That old bat always makes me shudder,” said Bianchon in a low voice,\r\nindicating Mlle. Michonneau to Vautrin. “I have studied Gall’s system,\r\nand I am sure she has the bump of Judas.”\r\n\r\n“Then you have seen a case before?” said Vautrin.\r\n\r\n“Who has not?” answered Bianchon. “Upon my word, that ghastly old maid\r\nlooks just like one of the long worms that will gnaw a beam through,\r\ngive them time enough.”\r\n\r\n“That is the way, young man,” returned he of the forty years and the\r\ndyed whiskers:\r\n\r\n  “The rose has lived the life of a rose--\r\n   A morning’s space.”\r\n\r\n“Aha! here is a magnificent _soupe-au-rama_,” cried Poiret as Christophe\r\ncame in bearing the soup with cautious heed.\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon, sir,” said Mme. Vauquer; “it is _soupe aux choux_.”\r\n\r\nAll the young men roared with laughter.\r\n\r\n“Had you there, Poiret!”\r\n\r\n“Poir-r-r-rette! she had you there!”\r\n\r\n“Score two points to Mamma Vauquer,” said Vautrin.\r\n\r\n“Did any of you notice the fog this morning?” asked the official.\r\n\r\n“It was a frantic fog,” said Bianchon, “a fog unparalleled, doleful,\r\nmelancholy, sea-green, asthmatical--a Goriot of a fog!”\r\n\r\n“A Goriorama,” said the art student, “because you couldn’t see a thing\r\nin it.”\r\n\r\n“Hey! Milord Gaoriotte, they air talking about yoo-o-ou!”\r\n\r\nFather Goriot, seated at the lower end of the table, close to the door\r\nthrough which the servant entered, raised his face; he had smelt at a\r\nscrap of bread that lay under his table napkin, an old trick acquired in\r\nhis commercial capacity, that still showed itself at times.\r\n\r\n“Well,” Madame Vauquer cried in sharp tones, that rang above the rattle\r\nof spoons and plates and the sound of other voices, “and is there\r\nanything the matter with the bread?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing whatever, madame,” he answered; “on the contrary, it is made of\r\nthe best quality of corn; flour from Etampes.”\r\n\r\n“How could you tell?” asked Eugene.\r\n\r\n“By the color, by the flavor.”\r\n\r\n“You knew the flavor by the smell, I suppose,” said Mme. Vauquer. “You\r\nhave grown so economical, you will find out how to live on the smell of\r\ncooking at last.”\r\n\r\n“Take out a patent for it, then,” cried the Museum official; “you would\r\nmake a handsome fortune.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind him,” said the artist; “he does that sort of thing to delude\r\nus into thinking that he was a vermicelli maker.”\r\n\r\n“Your nose is a corn-sampler, it appears?” inquired the official.\r\n\r\n“Corn _what_?” asked Bianchon.\r\n\r\n“Corn-el.”\r\n\r\n“Corn-et.”\r\n\r\n“Corn-elian.”\r\n\r\n“Corn-ice.”\r\n\r\n“Corn-ucopia.”\r\n\r\n“Corn-crake.”\r\n\r\n“Corn-cockle.”\r\n\r\n“Corn-orama.”\r\n\r\nThe eight responses came like a rolling fire from every part of the\r\nroom, and the laughter that followed was the more uproarious because\r\npoor Father Goriot stared at the others with a puzzled look, like a\r\nforeigner trying to catch the meaning of words in a language which he\r\ndoes not understand.\r\n\r\n“Corn?...” he said, turning to Vautrin, his next neighbor.\r\n\r\n“Corn on your foot, old man!” said Vautrin, and he drove Father Goriot’s\r\ncap down over his eyes by a blow on the crown.\r\n\r\nThe poor old man thus suddenly attacked was for a moment too bewildered\r\nto do anything. Christophe carried off his plate, thinking that he had\r\nfinished his soup, so that when Goriot had pushed back his cap from his\r\neyes his spoon encountered the table. Every one burst out laughing. “You\r\nare a disagreeable joker, sir,” said the old man, “and if you take any\r\nfurther liberties with me----”\r\n\r\n“Well, what then, old boy?” Vautrin interrupted.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, you shall pay dearly for it some day----”\r\n\r\n“Down below, eh?” said the artist, “in the little dark corner where they\r\nput naughty boys.”\r\n\r\n“Well, mademoiselle,” Vautrin said, turning to Victorine, “you are\r\neating nothing. So papa was refractory, was he?”\r\n\r\n“A monster!” said Mme. Couture.\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle might make application for aliment pending her suit; she\r\nis not eating anything. Eh! eh! just see how Father Goriot is staring at\r\nMlle. Victorine.”\r\n\r\nThe old man had forgotten his dinner, he was so absorbed in gazing at\r\nthe poor girl; the sorrow in her face was unmistakable,--the slighted\r\nlove of a child whose father would not recognize her.\r\n\r\n“We are mistaken about Father Goriot, my dear boy,” said Eugene in a low\r\nvoice. “He is not an idiot, nor wanting in energy. Try your Gall system\r\non him, and let me know what you think. I saw him crush a silver dish\r\nlast night as if it had been made of wax; there seems to be something\r\nextraordinary going on in his mind just now, to judge by his face. His\r\nlife is so mysterious that it must be worth studying. Oh! you may laugh,\r\nBianchon; I am not joking.”\r\n\r\n“The man is a subject, is he?” said Bianchon; “all right! I will dissect\r\nhim, if he will give me the chance.”\r\n\r\n“No; feel his bumps.”\r\n\r\n“Hm!--his stupidity might perhaps be contagious.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day Rastignac dressed himself very elegantly, and about three\r\no’clock in the afternoon went to call on Mme. de Restaud. On the way\r\nthither he indulged in the wild intoxicating dreams which fill a young\r\nhead so full of delicious excitement. Young men at his age take\r\nno account of obstacles nor of dangers; they see success in every\r\ndirection; imagination has free play, and turns their lives into a\r\nromance; they are saddened or discouraged by the collapse of one of the\r\nvisionary schemes that have no existence save in their heated fancy. If\r\nyouth were not ignorant and timid, civilization would be impossible.\r\n\r\nEugene took unheard-of pains to keep himself in a spotless condition,\r\nbut on his way through the streets he began to think about Mme. de\r\nRestaud and what he should say to her. He equipped himself with wit,\r\nrehearsed repartees in the course of an imaginary conversation, and\r\nprepared certain neat speeches a la Talleyrand, conjuring up a series of\r\nsmall events which should prepare the way for the declaration on which\r\nhe had based his future; and during these musings the law student was\r\nbespattered with mud, and by the time he reached the Palais Royal he was\r\nobliged to have his boots blacked and his trousers brushed.\r\n\r\n“If I were rich,” he said, as he changed the five-franc piece he had\r\nbrought with him in case anything might happen, “I would take a cab,\r\nthen I could think at my ease.”\r\n\r\nAt last he reached the Rue du Helder, and asked for the Comtesse de\r\nRestaud. He bore the contemptuous glances of the servants, who had seen\r\nhim cross the court on foot, with the cold fury of a man who knows that\r\nhe will succeed some day. He understood the meaning of their glances at\r\nonce, for he had felt his inferiority as soon as he entered the court,\r\nwhere a smart cab was waiting. All the delights of life in Paris\r\nseemed to be implied by this visible and manifest sign of luxury and\r\nextravagance. A fine horse, in magnificent harness, was pawing the\r\nground, and all at once the law student felt out of humor with himself.\r\nEvery compartment in his brain which he had thought to find so full of\r\nwit was bolted fast; he grew positively stupid. He sent up his name\r\nto the Countess, and waited in the ante-chamber, standing on one foot\r\nbefore a window that looked out upon the court; mechanically he leaned\r\nhis elbow against the sash, and stared before him. The time seemed long;\r\nhe would have left the house but for the southern tenacity of purpose\r\nwhich works miracles when it is single-minded.\r\n\r\n“Madame is in her boudoir, and cannot see any one at present, sir,”\r\n said the servant. “She gave me no answer; but if you will go into the\r\ndining-room, there is some one already there.”\r\n\r\nRastignac was impressed with a sense of the formidable power of the\r\nlackey who can accuse or condemn his masters by a word; he coolly opened\r\nthe door by which the man had just entered the ante-chamber, meaning,\r\nno doubt, to show these insolent flunkeys that he was familiar with the\r\nhouse; but he found that he had thoughtlessly precipitated himself into\r\na small room full of dressers, where lamps were standing, and hot-water\r\npipes, on which towels were being dried; a dark passage and a back\r\nstaircase lay beyond it. Stifled laughter from the ante-chamber added to\r\nhis confusion.\r\n\r\n“This way to the drawing-room, sir,” said the servant, with the\r\nexaggerated respect which seemed to be one more jest at his expense.\r\n\r\nEugene turned so quickly that he stumbled against a bath. By good luck,\r\nhe managed to keep his hat on his head, and saved it from immersion in\r\nthe water; but just as he turned, a door opened at the further end of\r\nthe dark passage, dimly lighted by a small lamp. Rastignac heard voices\r\nand the sound of a kiss; one of the speakers was Mme. de Restaud,\r\nthe other was Father Goriot. Eugene followed the servant through the\r\ndining-room into the drawing-room; he went to a window that looked\r\nout into the courtyard, and stood there for a while. He meant to know\r\nwhether this Goriot was really the Goriot that he knew. His heart\r\nbeat unwontedly fast; he remembered Vautrin’s hideous insinuations. A\r\nwell-dressed young man suddenly emerged from the room almost as Eugene\r\nentered it, saying impatiently to the servant who stood at the door: “I\r\nam going, Maurice. Tell Madame la Comtesse that I waited more than half\r\nan hour for her.”\r\n\r\nWhereupon this insolent being, who, doubtless, had a right to be\r\ninsolent, sang an Italian trill, and went towards the window where\r\nEugene was standing, moved thereto quite as much by a desire to see the\r\nstudent’s face as by a wish to look out into the courtyard.\r\n\r\n“But M. le Comte had better wait a moment longer; madame is disengaged,”\r\n said Maurice, as he returned to the ante-chamber.\r\n\r\nJust at that moment Father Goriot appeared close to the gate; he had\r\nemerged from a door at the foot of the back staircase. The worthy soul\r\nwas preparing to open his umbrella regardless of the fact that the great\r\ngate had opened to admit a tilbury, in which a young man with a ribbon\r\nat his button-hole was seated. Father Goriot had scarcely time to start\r\nback and save himself. The horse took fright at the umbrella, swerved,\r\nand dashed forward towards the flight of steps. The young man looked\r\nround in annoyance, saw Father Goriot, and greeted him as he went out\r\nwith constrained courtesy, such as people usually show to a money-lender\r\nso long as they require his services, or the sort of respect they feel\r\nit necessary to show for some one whose reputation has been blown upon,\r\nso that they blush to acknowledge his acquaintance. Father Goriot gave\r\nhim a little friendly nod and a good-natured smile. All this happened\r\nwith lightning speed. Eugene was so deeply interested that he forgot\r\nthat he was not alone till he suddenly heard the Countess’ voice.\r\n\r\n“Oh! Maxime, were you going away?” she said reproachfully, with a shade\r\nof pique in her manner. The Countess had not seen the incident nor the\r\nentrance of the tilbury. Rastignac turned abruptly and saw her standing\r\nbefore him, coquettishly dressed in a loose white cashmere gown with\r\nknots of rose-colored ribbon here and there; her hair was carelessly\r\ncoiled about her head, as is the wont of Parisian women in the morning;\r\nthere was a soft fragrance about her--doubtless she was fresh from\r\na bath;--her graceful form seemed more flexible, her beauty more\r\nluxuriant. Her eyes glistened. A young man can see everything at a\r\nglance; he feels the radiant influence of woman as a plant discerns and\r\nabsorbs its nutriment from the air; he did not need to touch her hands\r\nto feel their cool freshness. He saw faint rose tints through the\r\ncashmere of the dressing gown; it had fallen slightly open, giving\r\nglimpses of a bare throat, on which the student’s eyes rested. The\r\nCountess had no need of the adventitious aid of corsets; her girdle\r\ndefined the outlines of her slender waist; her throat was a challenge\r\nto love; her feet, thrust into slippers, were daintily small. As Maxime\r\ntook her hand and kissed it, Eugene became aware of Maxime’s existence,\r\nand the Countess saw Eugene.\r\n\r\n“Oh! is that you M. de Rastignac? I am very glad to see you,” she said,\r\nbut there was something in her manner that a shrewd observer would have\r\ntaken as a hint to depart.\r\n\r\nMaxime, as the Countess Anastasie had called the young man with the\r\nhaughty insolence of bearing, looked from Eugene to the lady, and from\r\nthe lady to Eugene; it was sufficiently evident that he wished to be rid\r\nof the latter. An exact and faithful rendering of the glance might be\r\ngiven in the words: “Look here, my dear; I hope you intend to send this\r\nlittle whipper-snapper about his business.”\r\n\r\nThe Countess consulted the young man’s face with an intent\r\nsubmissiveness that betrays all the secrets of a woman’s heart, and\r\nRastignac all at once began to hate him violently. To begin with, the\r\nsight of the fair carefully arranged curls on the other’s comely\r\nhead had convinced him that his own crop was hideous; Maxime’s boots,\r\nmoreover, were elegant and spotless, while his own, in spite of all\r\nhis care, bore some traces of his recent walk; and, finally, Maxime’s\r\novercoat fitted the outline of his figure gracefully, he looked like a\r\npretty woman, while Eugene was wearing a black coat at half-past two.\r\nThe quick-witted child of the Charente felt the disadvantage at which he\r\nwas placed beside this tall, slender dandy, with the clear gaze and\r\nthe pale face, one of those men who would ruin orphan children without\r\nscruple. Mme. de Restaud fled into the next room without waiting for\r\nEugene to speak; shaking out the skirts of her dressing-gown in her\r\nflight, so that she looked like a white butterfly, and Maxime hurried\r\nafter her. Eugene, in a fury, followed Maxime and the Countess, and\r\nthe three stood once more face to face by the hearth in the large\r\ndrawing-room. The law student felt quite sure that the odious Maxime\r\nfound him in the way, and even at the risk of displeasing Mme. de\r\nRestaud, he meant to annoy the dandy. It had struck him all at once that\r\nhe had seen the young man before at Mme. de Beauseant’s ball; he guessed\r\nthe relation between Maxime and Mme. de Restaud; and with the youthful\r\naudacity that commits prodigious blunders or achieves signal success, he\r\nsaid to himself, “This is my rival; I mean to cut him out.”\r\n\r\nRash resolve! He did not know that M. le Comte Maxime de Trailles would\r\nwait till he was insulted, so as to fire first and kill his man. Eugene\r\nwas a sportsman and a good shot, but he had not yet hit the bulls’s eye\r\ntwenty times out of twenty-two. The young Count dropped into a low chair\r\nby the hearth, took up the tongs, and made up the fire so violently and\r\nso sulkily, that Anastasie’s fair face suddenly clouded over. She turned\r\nto Eugene, with a cool, questioning glance that asked plainly, “Why do\r\nyou not go?” a glance which well-bred people regard as a cue to make\r\ntheir exit.\r\n\r\nEugene assumed an amiable expression.\r\n\r\n“Madame,” he began, “I hastened to call upon you----”\r\n\r\nHe stopped short. The door opened, and the owner of the tilbury suddenly\r\nappeared. He had left his hat outside, and did not greet the Countess;\r\nhe looked meditatively at Rastignac, and held out his hand to Maxime\r\nwith a cordial “Good morning,” that astonished Eugene not a little. The\r\nyoung provincial did not understand the amenities of a triple alliance.\r\n\r\n“M. de Restaud,” said the Countess, introducing her husband to the law\r\nstudent.\r\n\r\nEugene bowed profoundly.\r\n\r\n“This gentleman,” she continued, presenting Eugene to her husband,\r\n“is M. de Rastignac; he is related to Mme. la Vicomtesse de Beauseant\r\nthrough the Marcillacs; I had the pleasure of meeting him at her last\r\nball.”\r\n\r\n_Related to Mme. la Vicomtesse de Beauseant through the Marcillacs!_\r\nThese words, on which the countess threw ever so slight an emphasis, by\r\nreason of the pride that the mistress of a house takes in showing\r\nthat she only receives people of distinction as visitors in her house,\r\nproduced a magical effect. The Count’s stiff manner relaxed at once as\r\nhe returned the student’s bow.\r\n\r\n“Delighted to have an opportunity of making your acquaintance,” he said.\r\n\r\nMaxime de Trailles himself gave Eugene an uneasy glance, and suddenly\r\ndropped his insolent manner. The mighty name had all the power of a\r\nfairy’s wand; those closed compartments in the southern brain flew open\r\nagain; Rastignac’s carefully drilled faculties returned. It was as if a\r\nsudden light had pierced the obscurity of this upper world of Paris, and\r\nhe began to see, though everything was indistinct as yet. Mme. Vauquer’s\r\nlodging-house and Father Goriot were very far remote from his thoughts.\r\n\r\n“I thought that the Marcillacs were extinct,” the Comte de Restaud said,\r\naddressing Eugene.\r\n\r\n“Yes, they are extinct,” answered the law student. “My great-uncle, the\r\nChevalier de Rastignac, married the heiress of the Marcillac family.\r\nThey had only one daughter, who married the Marechal de Clarimbault,\r\nMme. de Beauseant’s grandfather on the mother’s side. We are the younger\r\nbranch of the family, and the younger branch is all the poorer because\r\nmy great-uncle, the Vice-Admiral, lost all that he had in the King’s\r\nservice. The Government during the Revolution refused to admit our\r\nclaims when the Compagnie des Indes was liquidated.”\r\n\r\n“Was not your great-uncle in command of the _Vengeur_ before 1789?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Then he would be acquainted with my grandfather, who commanded the\r\n_Warwick_.”\r\n\r\nMaxime looked at Mme. de Restaud and shrugged his shoulders, as who\r\nshould say, “If he is going to discuss nautical matters with that\r\nfellow, it is all over with us.” Anastasie understood the glance that M.\r\nde Trailles gave her. With a woman’s admirable tact, she began to smile\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n“Come with me, Maxime; I have something to say to you. We will leave\r\nyou two gentlemen to sail in company on board the _Warwick_ and the\r\n_Vengeur_.”\r\n\r\nShe rose to her feet and signed to Maxime to follow her, mirth and\r\nmischief in her whole attitude, and the two went in the direction of the\r\nboudoir. The _morganatic_ couple (to use a convenient German expression\r\nwhich has no exact equivalent) had reached the door, when the Count\r\ninterrupted himself in his talk with Eugene.\r\n\r\n“Anastasie!” he cried pettishly, “just stay a moment, dear; you know\r\nvery well that----”\r\n\r\n“I am coming back in a minute,” she interrupted; “I have a commission\r\nfor Maxime to execute, and I want to tell him about it.”\r\n\r\nShe came back almost immediately. She had noticed the inflection in her\r\nhusband’s voice, and knew that it would not be safe to retire to the\r\nboudoir; like all women who are compelled to study their husbands’\r\ncharacters in order to have their own way, and whose business it is\r\nto know exactly how far they can go without endangering a good\r\nunderstanding, she was very careful to avoid petty collisions in\r\ndomestic life. It was Eugene who had brought about this untoward\r\nincident; so the Countess looked at Maxime and indicated the law student\r\nwith an air of exasperation. M. de Trailles addressed the Count, the\r\nCountess, and Eugene with the pointed remark, “You are busy, I do not\r\nwant to interrupt you; good-day,” and he went.\r\n\r\n“Just wait a moment, Maxime!” the Count called after him.\r\n\r\n“Come and dine with us,” said the Countess, leaving Eugene and her\r\nhusband together once more. She followed Maxime into the little\r\ndrawing-room, where they sat together sufficiently long to feel sure\r\nthat Rastignac had taken his leave.\r\n\r\nThe law student heard their laughter, and their voices, and the pauses\r\nin their talk; he grew malicious, exerted his conversational powers for\r\nM. de Restaud, flattered him, and drew him into discussions, to the\r\nend that he might see the Countess again and discover the nature of her\r\nrelations with Father Goriot. This Countess with a husband and a lover,\r\nfor Maxime clearly was her lover, was a mystery. What was the secret tie\r\nthat bound her to the old tradesman? This mystery he meant to penetrate,\r\nhoping by its means to gain a sovereign ascendency over this fair\r\ntypical Parisian.\r\n\r\n“Anastasie!” the Count called again to his wife.\r\n\r\n“Poor Maxime!” she said, addressing the young man. “Come, we must resign\r\nourselves. This evening----”\r\n\r\n“I hope, Nasie,” he said in her ear, “that you will give orders not to\r\nadmit that youngster, whose eyes light up like live coals when he looks\r\nat you. He will make you a declaration, and compromise you, and then you\r\nwill compel me to kill him.”\r\n\r\n“Are you mad, Maxime?” she said. “A young lad of a student is, on the\r\ncontrary, a capital lightning-conductor; is not that so? Of course, I\r\nmean to make Restaud furiously jealous of him.”\r\n\r\nMaxime burst out laughing, and went out, followed by the Countess, who\r\nstood at the window to watch him into his carriage; he shook his whip,\r\nand made his horse prance. She only returned when the great gate had\r\nbeen closed after him.\r\n\r\n“What do you think, dear?” cried the Count, her husband, “this\r\ngentleman’s family estate is not far from Verteuil, on the Charente; his\r\ngreat-uncle and my grandfather were acquainted.”\r\n\r\n“Delighted to find that we have acquaintances in common,” said the\r\nCountess, with a preoccupied manner.\r\n\r\n“More than you think,” said Eugene, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” she asked quickly.\r\n\r\n“Why, only just now,” said the student, “I saw a gentleman go out at\r\nthe gate, Father Goriot, my next door neighbor in the house where I am\r\nlodging.”\r\n\r\nAt the sound of this name, and the prefix that embellished it, the\r\nCount, who was stirring the fire, let the tongs fall as though they had\r\nburned his fingers, and rose to his feet.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” he cried, “you might have called him ‘Monsieur Goriot’!”\r\n\r\nThe Countess turned pale at first at the sight of her husband’s\r\nvexation, then she reddened; clearly she was embarrassed, her answer\r\nwas made in a tone that she tried to make natural, and with an air of\r\nassumed carelessness:\r\n\r\n“You could not know any one who is dearer to us both...”\r\n\r\nShe broke off, glanced at the piano as if some fancy had crossed her\r\nmind, and asked, “Are you fond of music, M. de Rastignac?”\r\n\r\n“Exceedingly,” answered Eugene, flushing, and disconcerted by a dim\r\nsuspicion that he had somehow been guilty of a clumsy piece of folly.\r\n\r\n“Do you sing?” she cried, going to the piano, and, sitting down before\r\nit, she swept her fingers over the keyboard from end to end. R-r-r-rah!\r\n\r\n“No, madame.”\r\n\r\nThe Comte de Restaud walked to and fro.\r\n\r\n“That is a pity; you are without one great means of success.--_Ca-ro,\r\nca-a-ro, ca-a-a-ro, non du-bi-ta-re_,” sang the Countess.\r\n\r\nEugene had a second time waved a magic wand when he uttered Goriot’s\r\nname, but the effect seemed to be entirely opposite to that produced by\r\nthe formula “related to Mme. de Beauseant.” His position was not\r\nunlike that of some visitor permitted as a favor to inspect a private\r\ncollection of curiosities, when by inadvertence he comes into collision\r\nwith a glass case full of sculptured figures, and three or four heads,\r\nimperfectly secured, fall at the shock. He wished the earth would open\r\nand swallow him. Mme. de Restaud’s expression was reserved and chilly,\r\nher eyes had grown indifferent, and sedulously avoided meeting those of\r\nthe unlucky student of law.\r\n\r\n“Madame,” he said, “you wish to talk with M. de Restaud; permit me to\r\nwish you good-day----”\r\n\r\nThe Countess interrupted him by a gesture, saying hastily, “Whenever you\r\ncome to see us, both M. de Restaud and I shall be delighted to see you.”\r\n\r\nEugene made a profound bow and took his leave, followed by M. de\r\nRestaud, who insisted, in spite of his remonstrances, on accompanying\r\nhim into the hall.\r\n\r\n“Neither your mistress nor I are at home to that gentleman when he\r\ncalls,” the Count said to Maurice.\r\n\r\nAs Eugene set foot on the steps, he saw that it was raining.\r\n\r\n“Come,” said he to himself, “somehow I have just made a mess of it, I\r\ndo not know how. And now I am going to spoil my hat and coat into the\r\nbargain. I ought to stop in my corner, grind away at law, and never\r\nlook to be anything but a boorish country magistrate. How can I go\r\ninto society, when to manage properly you want a lot of cabs, varnished\r\nboots, gold watch chains, and all sorts of things; you have to wear\r\nwhite doeskin gloves that cost six francs in the morning, and primrose\r\nkid gloves every evening? A fig for that old humbug of a Goriot!”\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the street door, the driver of a hackney coach, who had\r\nprobably just deposited a wedding party at their door, and asked nothing\r\nbetter than a chance of making a little money for himself without his\r\nemployer’s knowledge, saw that Eugene had no umbrella, remarked his\r\nblack coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves, and varnished boots, and\r\nstopped and looked at him inquiringly. Eugene, in the blind desperation\r\nthat drives a young man to plunge deeper and deeper into an abyss, as if\r\nhe might hope to find a fortunate issue in its lowest depths, nodded\r\nin reply to the driver’s signal, and stepped into the cab; a few stray\r\npetals of orange blossom and scraps of wire bore witness to its recent\r\noccupation by a wedding party.\r\n\r\n“Where am I to drive, sir?” demanded the man, who, by this time, had\r\ntaken off his white gloves.\r\n\r\n“Confound it!” Eugene said to himself, “I am in for it now, and at least\r\nI will not spend cab-hire for nothing!--Drive to the Hotel Beauseant,”\r\n he said aloud.\r\n\r\n“Which?” asked the man, a portentous word that reduced Eugene to\r\nconfusion. This young man of fashion, species incerta, did not know that\r\nthere were two Hotels Beauseant; he was not aware how rich he was in\r\nrelations who did not care about him.\r\n\r\n“The Vicomte de Beauseant, Rue----”\r\n\r\n“De Grenelle,” interrupted the driver, with a jerk of his head. “You\r\nsee, there are the hotels of the Marquis and Comte de Beauseant in the\r\nRue Saint-Dominique,” he added, drawing up the step.\r\n\r\n“I know all about that,” said Eugene, severely.--“Everybody is laughing\r\nat me to-day, it seems!” he said to himself, as he deposited his hat on\r\nthe opposite seat. “This escapade will cost me a king’s ransom, but,\r\nat any rate, I shall call on my so-called cousin in a thoroughly\r\naristocratic fashion. Goriot has cost me ten francs already, the old\r\nscoundrel. My word! I will tell Mme. de Beauseant about my adventure;\r\nperhaps it may amuse her. Doubtless she will know the secret of the\r\ncriminal relation between that handsome woman and the old rat without a\r\ntail. It would be better to find favor in my cousin’s eyes than to\r\ncome in contact with that shameless woman, who seems to me to have very\r\nexpensive tastes. Surely the beautiful Vicomtesse’s personal interest\r\nwould turn the scale for me, when the mere mention of her name produces\r\nsuch an effect. Let us look higher. If you set yourself to carry the\r\nheights of heaven, you must face God.”\r\n\r\nThe innumerable thoughts that surged through his brain might be summed\r\nup in these phrases. He grew calmer, and recovered something of his\r\nassurance as he watched the falling rain. He told himself that though\r\nhe was about to squander two of the precious five-franc pieces that\r\nremained to him, the money was well laid out in preserving his coat,\r\nboots, and hat; and his cabman’s cry of “Gate, if you please,” almost\r\nput him in spirits. A Swiss, in scarlet and gold, appeared, the great\r\ndoor groaned on its hinges, and Rastignac, with sweet satisfaction,\r\nbeheld his equipage pass under the archway and stop before the flight\r\nof steps beneath the awning. The driver, in a blue-and-red greatcoat,\r\ndismounted and let down the step. As Eugene stepped out of the cab, he\r\nheard smothered laughter from the peristyle. Three or four lackeys\r\nwere making merry over the festal appearance of the vehicle. In\r\nanother moment the law student was enlightened as to the cause of their\r\nhilarity; he felt the full force of the contrast between his equipage\r\nand one of the smartest broughams in Paris; a coachman, with powdered\r\nhair, seemed to find it difficult to hold a pair of spirited horses, who\r\nstood chafing the bit. In Mme. de Restaud’s courtyard, in the Chaussee\r\nd’Antin, he had seen the neat turnout of a young man of six-and-twenty;\r\nin the Faubourg Saint-Germain he found the luxurious equipage of a man\r\nof rank; thirty thousand francs would not have purchased it.\r\n\r\n“Who can be here?” said Eugene to himself. He began to understand,\r\nthough somewhat tardily, that he must not expect to find many women in\r\nParis who were not already appropriated, and that the capture of one\r\nof these queens would be likely to cost something more than bloodshed.\r\n“Confound it all! I expect my cousin also has her Maxime.”\r\n\r\nHe went up the steps, feeling that he was a blighted being. The glass\r\ndoor was opened for him; the servants were as solemn as jackasses under\r\nthe curry comb. So far, Eugene had only been in the ballroom on the\r\nground floor of the Hotel Beauseant; the fete had followed so closely on\r\nthe invitation, that he had not had time to call on his cousin, and had\r\ntherefore never seen Mme. de Beauseant’s apartments; he was about to\r\nbehold for the first time a great lady among the wonderful and elegant\r\nsurroundings that reveal her character and reflect her daily life.\r\nHe was the more curious, because Mme. de Restaud’s drawing-room had\r\nprovided him with a standard of comparison.\r\n\r\nAt half-past four the Vicomtesse de Beauseant was visible. Five minutes\r\nearlier she would not have received her cousin, but Eugene knew nothing\r\nof the recognized routine of various houses in Paris. He was conducted\r\nup the wide, white-painted, crimson-carpeted staircase, between the\r\ngilded balusters and masses of flowering plants, to Mme. de Beauseant’s\r\napartments. He did not know the rumor current about Mme. de Beauseant,\r\none of the biographies told, with variations, in whispers, every evening\r\nin the salons of Paris.\r\n\r\nFor three years past her name had been spoken of in connection with\r\nthat of one of the most wealthy and distinguished Portuguese nobles,\r\nthe Marquis d’Ajuda-Pinto. It was one of those innocent _liaisons_ which\r\npossess so much charm for the two thus attached to each other that\r\nthey find the presence of a third person intolerable. The Vicomte de\r\nBeauseant, therefore, had himself set an example to the rest of the\r\nworld by respecting, with as good a grace as might be, this morganatic\r\nunion. Any one who came to call on the Vicomtesse in the early days of\r\nthis friendship was sure to find the Marquis d’Ajuda-Pinto there. As,\r\nunder the circumstances, Mme. de Beauseant could not very well shut her\r\ndoor against these visitors, she gave them such a cold reception, and\r\nshowed so much interest in the study of the ceiling, that no one could\r\nfail to understand how much he bored her; and when it became known in\r\nParis that Mme. de Beauseant was bored by callers between two and four\r\no’clock, she was left in perfect solitude during that interval. She\r\nwent to the Bouffons or to the Opera with M. de Beauseant and M.\r\nd’Ajuda-Pinto; and M. de Beauseant, like a well-bred man of the world,\r\nalways left his wife and the Portuguese as soon as he had installed\r\nthem. But M. d’Ajuda-Pinto must marry, and a Mlle. de Rochefide was the\r\nyoung lady. In the whole fashionable world there was but one person who\r\nas yet knew nothing of the arrangement, and that was Mme. de Beauseant.\r\nSome of her friends had hinted at the possibility, and she had laughed\r\nat them, believing that envy had prompted those ladies to try to make\r\nmischief. And now, though the bans were about to be published, and\r\nalthough the handsome Portuguese had come that day to break the news to\r\nthe Vicomtesse, he had not found courage as yet to say one word about\r\nhis treachery. How was it? Nothing is doubtless more difficult than the\r\nnotification of an ultimatum of this kind. There are men who feel more\r\nat their ease when they stand up before another man who threatens their\r\nlives with sword or pistol than in the presence of a woman who, after\r\ntwo hours of lamentations and reproaches, falls into a dead swoon and\r\nrequires salts. At this moment, therefore, M. d’Ajuda-Pinto was on\r\nthorns, and anxious to take his leave. He told himself that in some\r\nway or other the news would reach Mme. de Beauseant; he would write, it\r\nwould be much better to do it by letter, and not to utter the words that\r\nshould stab her to the heart.\r\n\r\nSo when the servant announced M. Eugene de Rastignac, the Marquis\r\nd’Ajuda-Pinto trembled with joy. To be sure, a loving woman shows even\r\nmore ingenuity in inventing doubts of her lover than in varying the\r\nmonotony of his happiness; and when she is about to be forsaken, she\r\ninstinctively interprets every gesture as rapidly as Virgil’s courser\r\ndetected the presence of his companion by snuffing the breeze. It was\r\nimpossible, therefore, that Mme. de Beauseant should not detect that\r\ninvoluntary thrill of satisfaction; slight though it was, it was\r\nappalling in its artlessness.\r\n\r\nEugene had yet to learn that no one in Paris should present himself in\r\nany house without first making himself acquainted with the whole history\r\nof its owner, and of its owner’s wife and family, so that he may avoid\r\nmaking any of the terrible blunders which in Poland draw forth the\r\npicturesque exclamation, “Harness five bullocks to your cart!” probably\r\nbecause you will need them all to pull you out of the quagmire into\r\nwhich a false step has plunged you. If, down to the present day, our\r\nlanguage has no name for these conversational disasters, it is probably\r\nbecause they are believed to be impossible, the publicity given in Paris\r\nto every scandal is so prodigious. After the awkward incident at Mme. de\r\nRestaud’s, no one but Eugene could have reappeared in his character\r\nof bullock-driver in Mme. de Beauseant’s drawing-room. But if Mme. de\r\nRestaud and M. de Trailles had found him horribly in the way, M. d’Ajuda\r\nhailed his coming with relief.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye,” said the Portuguese, hurrying to the door, as Eugene made\r\nhis entrance into a dainty little pink-and-gray drawing-room, where\r\nluxury seemed nothing more than good taste.\r\n\r\n“Until this evening,” said Mme. de Beauseant, turning her head to give\r\nthe Marquis a glance. “We are going to the Bouffons, are we not?”\r\n\r\n“I cannot go,” he said, with his fingers on the door handle.\r\n\r\nMme. de Beauseant rose and beckoned to him to return. She did not\r\npay the slightest attention to Eugene, who stood there dazzled by the\r\nsparkling marvels around him; he began to think that this was some story\r\nout of the Arabian Nights made real, and did not know where to hide\r\nhimself, when the woman before him seemed to be unconscious of his\r\nexistence. The Vicomtesse had raised the forefinger of her right hand,\r\nand gracefully signed to the Marquis to seat himself beside her. The\r\nMarquis felt the imperious sway of passion in her gesture; he came back\r\ntowards her. Eugene watched him, not without a feeling of envy.\r\n\r\n“That is the owner of the brougham!” he said to himself. “But is it\r\nnecessary to have a pair of spirited horses, servants in livery, and\r\ntorrents of gold to draw a glance from a woman here in Paris?”\r\n\r\nThe demon of luxury gnawed at his heart, greed burned in his veins, his\r\nthroat was parched with the thirst of gold.\r\n\r\nHe had a hundred and thirty francs every quarter. His father, mother,\r\nbrothers, sisters, and aunt did not spend two hundred francs a month\r\namong them. This swift comparison between his present condition and the\r\naims he had in view helped to benumb his faculties.\r\n\r\n“Why not?” the Vicomtesse was saying, as she smiled at the Portuguese.\r\n“Why cannot you come to the Italiens?”\r\n\r\n“Affairs! I am to dine with the English Ambassador.”\r\n\r\n“Throw him over.”\r\n\r\nWhen a man once enters on a course of deception, he is compelled to\r\nadd lie to lie. M. d’Ajuda therefore said, smiling, “Do you lay your\r\ncommands on me?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, certainly.”\r\n\r\n“That was what I wanted to have you say to me,” he answered, dissembling\r\nhis feelings in a glance which would have reassured any other woman.\r\n\r\nHe took the Vicomtesse’s hand, kissed it, and went.\r\n\r\nEugene ran his fingers through his hair, and constrained himself to bow.\r\nHe thought that now Mme. de Beauseant would give him her attention;\r\nbut suddenly she sprang forward, rushed to a window in the gallery, and\r\nwatched M. d’Ajuda step into his carriage; she listened to the order\r\nthat he gave, and heard the Swiss repeat it to the coachman:\r\n\r\n“To M. de Rochefide’s house.”\r\n\r\nThose words, and the way in which M. d’Ajuda flung himself back in the\r\ncarriage, were like a lightning flash and a thunderbolt for her; she\r\nwalked back again with a deadly fear gnawing at her heart. The most\r\nterrible catastrophes only happen among the heights. The Vicomtesse\r\nwent to her own room, sat down at a table, and took up a sheet of dainty\r\nnotepaper.\r\n\r\n\r\n  “When, instead of dining with the English Ambassador,”\r\n    she wrote, “you go to the Rochefides, you owe me an\r\n   explanation, which I am waiting to hear.”\r\n\r\n\r\nShe retraced several of the letters, for her hand was trembling so that\r\nthey were indistinct; then she signed the note with an initial C for\r\n“Claire de Bourgogne,” and rang the bell.\r\n\r\n“Jacques,” she said to the servant, who appeared immediately, “take\r\nthis note to M. de Rochefide’s house at half-past seven and ask for the\r\nMarquis d’Ajuda. If M. d’Ajuda is there, leave the note without waiting\r\nfor an answer; if he is not there, bring the note back to me.”\r\n\r\n“Madame la Vicomtess, there is a visitor in the drawing-room.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! yes, of course,” she said, opening the door.\r\n\r\nEugene was beginning to feel very uncomfortable, but at last the\r\nVicomtesse appeared; she spoke to him, and the tremulous tones of her\r\nvoice vibrated through his heart.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, monsieur,” she said; “I had a letter to write. Now I am\r\nquite at liberty.”\r\n\r\nShe scarcely knew what she was saying, for even as she spoke she\r\nthought, “Ah! he means to marry Mlle. de Rochefide? But is he still\r\nfree? This evening the marriage shall be broken off, or else... But\r\nbefore to-morrow I shall know.”\r\n\r\n“Cousin...” the student replied.\r\n\r\n“Eh?” said the Countess, with an insolent glance that sent a cold\r\nshudder through Eugene; he understood what that “Eh?” meant; he had\r\nlearned a great deal in three hours, and his wits were on the alert. He\r\nreddened:\r\n\r\n“Madame...” he began; he hesitated a moment, and then went on.\r\n“Pardon me; I am in such need of protection that the nearest scrap of\r\nrelationship could do me no harm.”\r\n\r\nMme. de Beauseant smiled but there was sadness in her smile; even now\r\nshe felt forebodings of the coming pain, the air she breathed was heavy\r\nwith the storm that was about to burst.\r\n\r\n“If you knew how my family are situated,” he went on, “you would love to\r\nplay the part of a beneficent fairy godmother who graciously clears the\r\nobstacles from the path of her protege.”\r\n\r\n“Well, cousin,” she said, laughing, “and how can I be of service to\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“But do I know even that? I am distantly related to you, and this\r\nobscure and remote relationship is even now a perfect godsend to me. You\r\nhave confused my ideas; I cannot remember the things that I meant to say\r\nto you. I know no one else here in Paris.... Ah! if I could only ask you\r\nto counsel me, ask you to look upon me as a poor child who would fain\r\ncling to the hem of your dress, who would lay down his life for you.”\r\n\r\n“Would you kill a man for me?”\r\n\r\n“Two,” said Eugene.\r\n\r\n“You, child. Yes, you are a child,” she said, keeping back the tears\r\nthat came to her eyes; “you would love sincerely.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” he cried, flinging up his head.\r\n\r\nThe audacity of the student’s answer interested the Vicomtesse in him.\r\nThe southern brain was beginning to scheme for the first time. Between\r\nMme. de Restaud’s blue boudoir and Mme. de Beauseant’s rose-colored\r\ndrawing-room he had made a three years’ advance in a kind of law which\r\nis not a recognized study in Paris, although it is a sort of higher\r\njurisprudence, and, when well understood, is a highroad to success of\r\nevery kind.\r\n\r\n“Ah! that is what I meant to say!” said Eugene. “I met Mme. de Restaud\r\nat your ball, and this morning I went to see her.\r\n\r\n“You must have been very much in the way,” said Mme. de Beauseant,\r\nsmiling as she spoke.\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed. I am a novice, and my blunders will set every one against\r\nme, if you do not give me your counsel. I believe that in Paris it is\r\nvery difficult to meet with a young, beautiful, and wealthy woman of\r\nfashion who would be willing to teach me, what you women can explain so\r\nwell--life. I shall find a M. de Trailles everywhere. So I have come to\r\nyou to ask you to give me a key to a puzzle, to entreat you to tell me\r\nwhat sort of blunder I made this morning. I mentioned an old man----”\r\n\r\n“Madame la Duchess de Langeais,” Jacques cut the student short; Eugene\r\ngave expression to his intense annoyance by a gesture.\r\n\r\n“If you mean to succeed,” said the Vicomtesse in a low voice, “in the\r\nfirst place you must not be so demonstrative.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! good morning, dear,” she continued, and rising and crossing the\r\nroom, she grasped the Duchess’ hands as affectionately as if they had\r\nbeen sisters; the Duchess responded in the prettiest and most gracious\r\nway.\r\n\r\n“Two intimate friends!” said Rastignac to himself. “Henceforward I shall\r\nhave two protectresses; those two women are great friends, no doubt, and\r\nthis newcomer will doubtless interest herself in her friend’s cousin.”\r\n\r\n“To what happy inspiration do I owe this piece of good fortune, dear\r\nAntoinette?” asked Mme. de Beauseant.\r\n\r\n“Well, I saw M. d’Ajuda-Pinto at M. de Rochefide’s door, so I thought\r\nthat if I came I should find you alone.”\r\n\r\nMme. de Beauseant’s mouth did not tighten, her color did not rise, her\r\nexpression did not alter, or rather, her brow seemed to clear as the\r\nDuchess uttered those deadly words.\r\n\r\n“If I had known that you were engaged----” the speaker added, glancing\r\nat Eugene.\r\n\r\n“This gentleman is M. Eugene de Rastignac, one of my cousins,” said the\r\nVicomtesse. “Have you any news of General de Montriveau?” she continued.\r\n“Serizy told me yesterday that he never goes anywhere now; has he been\r\nto see you to-day?”\r\n\r\nIt was believed that the Duchess was desperately in love with M. de\r\nMontriveau, and that he was a faithless lover; she felt the question in\r\nher very heart, and her face flushed as she answered:\r\n\r\n“He was at the Elysee yesterday.”\r\n\r\n“In attendance?”\r\n\r\n“Claire,” returned the Duchess, and hatred overflowed in the glances she\r\nthrew at Mme. de Beauseant; “of course you know that M. d’Ajuda-Pinto\r\nis going to marry Mlle. de Rochefide; the bans will be published\r\nto-morrow.”\r\n\r\nThis thrust was too cruel; the Vicomtesse’s face grew white, but she\r\nanswered, laughing, “One of those rumors that fools amuse themselves\r\nwith. What should induce M. d’Ajuda to take one of the noblest names\r\nin Portugal to the Rochefides? The Rochefides were only ennobled\r\nyesterday.”\r\n\r\n“But Bertha will have two hundred thousand livres a year, they say.”\r\n\r\n“M. d’Ajuda is too wealthy to marry for money.”\r\n\r\n“But, my dear, Mlle. de Rochefide is a charming girl.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?”\r\n\r\n“And, as a matter of fact, he is dining with them to-day; the thing\r\nis settled. It is very surprising to me that you should know so little\r\nabout it.”\r\n\r\nMme. de Beauseant turned to Rastignac. “What was the blunder that you\r\nmade, monsieur?” she asked. “The poor boy is only just launched into the\r\nworld, Antoinette, so that he understands nothing of all this that\r\nwe are speaking of. Be merciful to him, and let us finish our talk\r\nto-morrow. Everything will be announced to-morrow, you know, and\r\nyour kind informal communication can be accompanied by official\r\nconfirmation.”\r\n\r\nThe Duchess gave Eugene one of those insolent glances that measure a man\r\nfrom head to foot, and leave him crushed and annihilated.\r\n\r\n“Madame, I have unwittingly plunged a dagger into Mme. de Restaud’s\r\nheart; unwittingly--therein lies my offence,” said the student of law,\r\nwhose keen brain had served him sufficiently well, for he had detected\r\nthe biting epigrams that lurked beneath this friendly talk. “You\r\ncontinue to receive, possibly you fear, those who know the amount of\r\npain that they deliberately inflict; but a clumsy blunderer who has no\r\nidea how deeply he wounds is looked upon as a fool who does not know how\r\nto make use of his opportunities, and every one despises him.”\r\n\r\nMme. de Beauseant gave the student a glance, one of those glances in\r\nwhich a great soul can mingle dignity and gratitude. It was like balm\r\nto the law student, who was still smarting under the Duchess’ insolent\r\nscrutiny; she had looked at him as an auctioneer might look at some\r\narticle to appraise its value.\r\n\r\n“Imagine, too, that I had just made some progress with the Comte de\r\nRestaud; for I should tell you, madame,” he went on, turning to the\r\nDuchess with a mixture of humility and malice in his manner, “that as\r\nyet I am only a poor devil of a student, very much alone in the world,\r\nand very poor----”\r\n\r\n“You should not tell us that, M. de Rastignac. We women never care about\r\nanything that no one else will take.”\r\n\r\n“Bah!” said Eugene. “I am only two-and-twenty, and I must make up my\r\nmind to the drawbacks of my time of life. Besides, I am confessing\r\nmy sins, and it would be impossible to kneel in a more charming\r\nconfessional; you commit your sins in one drawing-room, and receive\r\nabsolution for them in another.”\r\n\r\nThe Duchess’ expression grew colder, she did not like the flippant tone\r\nof these remarks, and showed that she considered them to be in bad\r\ntaste by turning to the Vicomtesse with--“This gentleman has only just\r\ncome----”\r\n\r\nMme. de Beauseant began to laugh outright at her cousin and at the\r\nDuchess both.\r\n\r\n“He has only just come to Paris, dear, and is in search of some one who\r\nwill give him lessons in good taste.”\r\n\r\n“Mme. la Duchesse,” said Eugene, “is it not natural to wish to be\r\ninitiated into the mysteries which charm us?” (“Come, now,” he said to\r\nhimself, “my language is superfinely elegant, I’m sure.”)\r\n\r\n“But Mme. de Restaud is herself, I believe, M. de Trailles’ pupil,” said\r\nthe Duchess.\r\n\r\n“Of that I had no idea, madame,” answered the law student, “so I rashly\r\ncame between them. In fact, I got on very well with the lady’s husband,\r\nand his wife tolerated me for a time until I took it into my head to\r\ntell them that I knew some one of whom I had just caught a glimpse as he\r\nwent out by a back staircase, a man who had given the Countess a kiss at\r\nthe end of a passage.”\r\n\r\n“Who was it?” both women asked together.\r\n\r\n“An old man who lives at the rate of two louis a month in the Faubourg\r\nSaint-Marceau, where I, a poor student, lodge likewise. He is a truly\r\nunfortunate creature, everybody laughs at him--we all call him ‘Father\r\nGoriot.’”\r\n\r\n“Why, child that you are,” cried the Vicomtesse, “Mme. de Restaud was a\r\nMlle. Goriot!”\r\n\r\n“The daughter of a vermicelli manufacturer,” the Duchess added; “and\r\nwhen the little creature went to Court, the daughter of a pastry-cook\r\nwas presented on the same day. Do you remember, Claire? The King began\r\nto laugh, and made some joke in Latin about flour. People--what was\r\nit?--people----”\r\n\r\n“_Ejusdem farinoe_,” said Eugene.\r\n\r\n“Yes, that was it,” said the Duchess.\r\n\r\n“Oh! is that her father?” the law student continued, aghast.\r\n\r\n“Yes, certainly; the old man had two daughters; he dotes on them, so to\r\nspeak, though they will scarcely acknowledge him.”\r\n\r\n“Didn’t the second daughter marry a banker with a German name?” the\r\nVicomtesse asked, turning to Mme. de Langeais, “a Baron de Nucingen? And\r\nher name is Delphine, is it not? Isn’t she a fair-haired woman who has\r\na side-box at the Opera? She comes sometimes to the Bouffons, and laughs\r\nloudly to attract attention.”\r\n\r\nThe Duchess smiled and said:\r\n\r\n“I wonder at you, dear. Why do you take so much interest in people of\r\nthat kind? One must have been as madly in love as Restaud was, to be\r\ninfatuated with Mlle. Anastasie and her flour sacks. Oh! he will not\r\nfind her a good bargain! She is in M. de Trailles’ hands, and he will\r\nruin her.”\r\n\r\n“And they do not acknowledge their father!” Eugene repeated.\r\n\r\n“Oh! well, yes, their father, the father, a father,” replied the\r\nVicomtesse, “a kind father who gave them each five or six hundred\r\nthousand francs, it is said, to secure their happiness by marrying\r\nthem well; while he only kept eight or ten thousand livres a year for\r\nhimself, thinking that his daughters would always be his daughters,\r\nthinking that in them he would live his life twice over again, that\r\nin their houses he should find two homes, where he would be loved\r\nand looked up to, and made much of. And in two years’ time both his\r\nsons-in-law had turned him out of their houses as if he were one of the\r\nlowest outcasts.”\r\n\r\nTears came into Eugene’s eyes. He was still under the spell of youthful\r\nbeliefs, he had just left home, pure and sacred feelings had been\r\nstirred within him, and this was his first day on the battlefield of\r\ncivilization in Paris. Genuine feeling is so infectious that for a\r\nmoment the three looked at each other in silence.\r\n\r\n“_Eh, mon Dieu!_” said Mme. de Langeais; “yes, it seems very horrible,\r\nand yet we see such things every day. Is there not a reason for it?\r\nTell me, dear, have you ever really thought what a son-in-law is? A\r\nson-in-law is the man for whom we bring up, you and I, a dear little\r\none, bound to us very closely in innumerable ways; for seventeen years\r\nshe will be the joy of her family, its ‘white soul,’ as Lamartine says,\r\nand suddenly she will become its scourge. When HE comes and takes her\r\nfrom us, his love from the very beginning is like an axe laid to the\r\nroot of all the old affection in our darling’s heart, and all the ties\r\nthat bound her to her family are severed. But yesterday our little\r\ndaughter thought of no one but her mother and father, as we had no\r\nthought that was not for her; by to-morrow she will have become a\r\nhostile stranger. The tragedy is always going on under our eyes. On the\r\none hand you see a father who has sacrificed himself to his son, and\r\nhis daughter-in-law shows him the last degree of insolence. On the other\r\nhand, it is the son-in-law who turns his wife’s mother out of the house.\r\nI sometimes hear it said that there is nothing dramatic about society in\r\nthese days; but the Drama of the Son-in-law is appalling, to say nothing\r\nof our marriages, which have come to be very poor farces. I can explain\r\nhow it all came about in the old vermicelli maker’s case. I think I\r\nrecollect that Foriot----”\r\n\r\n“Goriot, madame.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that Moriot was once President of his Section during the\r\nRevolution. He was in the secret of the famous scarcity of grain, and\r\nlaid the foundation of his fortune in those days by selling flour for\r\nten times its cost. He had as much flour as he wanted. My grandmother’s\r\nsteward sold him immense quantities. No doubt Noriot shared the plunder\r\nwith the Committee of Public Salvation, as that sort of person always\r\ndid. I recollect the steward telling my grandmother that she might live\r\nat Grandvilliers in complete security, because her corn was as good as\r\na certificate of civism. Well, then, this Loriot, who sold corn to\r\nthose butchers, has never had but one passion, they say--he idolizes his\r\ndaughters. He settled one of them under Restaud’s roof, and grafted the\r\nother into the Nucingen family tree, the Baron de Nucingen being a rich\r\nbanker who had turned Royalist. You can quite understand that so long as\r\nBonaparte was Emperor, the two sons-in-law could manage to put up with\r\nthe old Ninety-three; but after the restoration of the Bourbons, M. de\r\nRestaud felt bored by the old man’s society, and the banker was still\r\nmore tired of it. His daughters were still fond of him; they wanted\r\n‘to keep the goat and the cabbage,’ so they used to see Joriot whenever\r\nthere was no one there, under pretence of affection. ‘Come to-day, papa,\r\nwe shall have you all to ourselves, and that will be much nicer!’\r\nand all that sort of thing. As for me, dear, I believe that love has\r\nsecond-sight: poor Ninety-three; his heart must have bled. He saw that\r\nhis daughters were ashamed of him, that if they loved their husbands\r\nhis visits must make mischief. So he immolated himself. He made the\r\nsacrifice because he was a father; he went into voluntary exile. His\r\ndaughters were satisfied, so he thought that he had done the best thing\r\nhe could; but it was a family crime, and father and daughters were\r\naccomplices. You see this sort of thing everywhere. What could this old\r\nDoriot have been but a splash of mud in his daughters’ drawing-rooms? He\r\nwould only have been in the way, and bored other people, besides being\r\nbored himself. And this that happened between father and daughters may\r\nhappen to the prettiest woman in Paris and the man she loves the best;\r\nif her love grows tiresome, he will go; he will descend to the basest\r\ntrickery to leave her. It is the same with all love and friendship. Our\r\nheart is a treasury; if you pour out all its wealth at once, you are\r\nbankrupt. We show no more mercy to the affection that reveals its utmost\r\nextent than we do to another kind of prodigal who has not a penny left.\r\nTheir father had given them all he had. For twenty years he had given\r\nhis whole heart to them; then, one day, he gave them all his fortune\r\ntoo. The lemon was squeezed; the girls left the rest in the gutter.”\r\n\r\n“The world is very base,” said the Vicomtesse, plucking at the threads\r\nof her shawl. She did not raise her head as she spoke; the words that\r\nMme. de Langeais had meant for her in the course of her story had cut\r\nher to the quick.\r\n\r\n“Base? Oh, no,” answered the Duchess; “the world goes its own way, that\r\nis all. If I speak in this way, it is only to show that I am not duped\r\nby it. I think as you do,” she said, pressing the Vicomtesse’s hand.\r\n“The world is a slough; let us try to live on the heights above it.”\r\n\r\nShe rose to her feet and kissed Mme. de Beauseant on the forehead as\r\nshe said: “You look very charming to-day, dear. I have never seen such a\r\nlovely color in your cheeks before.”\r\n\r\nThen she went out with a slight inclination of the head to the cousin.\r\n\r\n“Father Goriot is sublime!” said Eugene to himself, as he remembered how\r\nhe had watched his neighbor work the silver vessel into a shapeless mass\r\nthat night.\r\n\r\nMme. de Beauseant did not hear him; she was absorbed in her own\r\nthoughts. For several minutes the silence remained unbroken till the\r\nlaw student became almost paralyzed with embarrassment, and was equally\r\nafraid to go or stay or speak a word.\r\n\r\n“The world is basely ungrateful and ill-natured,” said the Vicomtesse\r\nat last. “No sooner does a trouble befall you than a friend is ready\r\nto bring the tidings and to probe your heart with the point of a\r\ndagger while calling on you to admire the handle. Epigrams and sarcasms\r\nalready! Ah! I will defend myself!”\r\n\r\nShe raised her head like the great lady that she was, and lightnings\r\nflashed from her proud eyes.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” she said, as she saw Eugene, “are you there?”\r\n\r\n“Still,” he said piteously.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, M. de Rastignac, deal with the world as it deserves. You\r\nare determined to succeed? I will help you. You shall sound the depths\r\nof corruption in woman; you shall measure the extent of man’s pitiful\r\nvanity. Deeply as I am versed in such learning, there were pages in the\r\nbook of life that I had not read. Now I know all. The more cold-blooded\r\nyour calculations, the further you will go. Strike ruthlessly; you will\r\nbe feared. Men and women for you must be nothing more than post-horses;\r\ntake a fresh relay, and leave the last to drop by the roadside; in this\r\nway you will reach the goal of your ambition. You will be nothing here,\r\nyou see, unless a woman interests herself in you; and she must be young\r\nand wealthy, and a woman of the world. Yet, if you have a heart, lock\r\nit carefully away like a treasure; do not let any one suspect it, or you\r\nwill be lost; you would cease to be the executioner, you would take\r\nthe victim’s place. And if ever you should love, never let your secret\r\nescape you! Trust no one until you are very sure of the heart to which\r\nyou open your heart. Learn to mistrust every one; take every precaution\r\nfor the sake of the love which does not exist as yet. Listen,\r\nMiguel”--the name slipped from her so naturally that she did not\r\nnotice her mistake--“there is something still more appalling than the\r\ningratitude of daughters who have cast off their old father and wish\r\nthat he were dead, and that is a rivalry between two sisters. Restaud\r\ncomes of a good family, his wife has been received into their circle;\r\nshe has been presented at court; and her sister, her wealthy sister,\r\nMme. Delphine de Nucingen, the wife of a great capitalist, is consumed\r\nwith envy, and ready to die of spleen. There is gulf set between the\r\nsisters--indeed, they are sisters no longer--the two women who refuse\r\nto acknowledge their father do not acknowledge each other. So Mme. de\r\nNucingen would lap up all the mud that lies between the Rue Saint-Lazare\r\nand the Rue de Grenelle to gain admittance to my salon. She fancied\r\nthat she should gain her end through de Marsay; she has made herself\r\nde Marsay’s slave, and she bores him. De Marsay cares very little about\r\nher. If you will introduce her to me, you will be her darling, her\r\nBenjamin; she will idolize you. If, after that, you can love her, do so;\r\nif not, make her useful. I will ask her to come once or twice to one of\r\nmy great crushes, but I will never receive her here in the morning. I\r\nwill bow to her when I see her, and that will be quite sufficient.\r\nYou have shut the Comtesse de Restaud’s door against you by mentioning\r\nFather Goriot’s name. Yes, my good friend, you may call at her house\r\ntwenty times, and every time out of the twenty you will find that she\r\nis not at home. The servants have their orders, and will not admit you.\r\nVery well, then, now let Father Goriot gain the right of entry into her\r\nsister’s house for you. The beautiful Mme. de Nucingen will give the\r\nsignal for a battle. As soon as she singles you out, other women will\r\nbegin to lose their heads about you, and her enemies and rivals and\r\nintimate friends will all try to take you from her. There are women who\r\nwill fall in love with a man because another woman has chosen him; like\r\nthe city madams, poor things, who copy our millinery, and hope thereby\r\nto acquire our manners. You will have a success, and in Paris success is\r\neverything; it is the key of power. If the women credit you with wit and\r\ntalent, the men will follow suit so long as you do not undeceive them\r\nyourself. There will be nothing you may not aspire to; you will go\r\neverywhere, and you will find out what the world is--an assemblage of\r\nfools and knaves. But you must be neither the one nor the other. I am\r\ngiving you my name like Ariadne’s clue of thread to take with you into\r\nthe labyrinth; make no unworthy use of it,” she said, with a queenly\r\nglance and curve of her throat; “give it back to me unsullied. And now,\r\ngo; leave me. We women also have our battles to fight.”\r\n\r\n“And if you should ever need some one who would gladly set a match to a\r\ntrain for you----”\r\n\r\n“Well?” she asked.\r\n\r\nHe tapped his heart, smiled in answer to his cousin’s smile, and went.\r\n\r\nIt was five o’clock, and Eugene was hungry; he was afraid lest he should\r\nnot be in time for dinner, a misgiving which made him feel that it was\r\npleasant to be borne so quickly across Paris. This sensation of physical\r\ncomfort left his mind free to grapple with the thoughts that assailed\r\nhim. A mortification usually sends a young man of his age into a furious\r\nrage; he shakes his fist at society, and vows vengeance when his belief\r\nin himself is shaken. Just then Rastignac was overwhelmed by the words,\r\n“You have shut the Countess’ door against you.”\r\n\r\n“I shall call!” he said to himself, “and if Mme. de Beauseant is right,\r\nif I never find her at home--I... well, Mme. de Restaud shall meet me\r\nin every salon in Paris. I will learn to fence and have some pistol\r\npractice, and kill that Maxime of hers!”\r\n\r\n“And money?” cried an inward monitor. “How about money, where is that\r\nto come from?” And all at once the wealth displayed in the Countess de\r\nRestaud’s drawing-room rose before his eyes. That was the luxury which\r\nGoriot’s daughter had loved too well, the gilding, the ostentatious\r\nsplendor, the unintelligent luxury of the parvenu, the riotous\r\nextravagance of a courtesan. Then the attractive vision suddenly went\r\nunder an eclipse as he remembered the stately grandeur of the Hotel de\r\nBeauseant. As his fancy wandered among these lofty regions in the great\r\nworld of Paris, innumerable dark thoughts gathered in his heart; his\r\nideas widened, and his conscience grew more elastic. He saw the world as\r\nit is; saw how the rich lived beyond the jurisdiction of law and public\r\nopinion, and found in success the _ultima ratio mundi_.\r\n\r\n“Vautrin is right, success is virtue!” he said to himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArrived in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve, he rushed up to his room for\r\nten francs wherewith to satisfy the demands of the cabman, and went\r\nin to dinner. He glanced round the squalid room, saw the eighteen\r\npoverty-stricken creatures about to feed like cattle in their stalls,\r\nand the sight filled him with loathing. The transition was too sudden,\r\nand the contrast was so violent that it could not but act as a powerful\r\nstimulant; his ambition developed and grew beyond all social bounds. On\r\nthe one hand, he beheld a vision of social life in its most charming\r\nand refined forms, of quick-pulsed youth, of fair, impassioned faces\r\ninvested with all the charm of poetry, framed in a marvelous setting of\r\nluxury or art; and, on the other hand, he saw a sombre picture, the miry\r\nverge beyond these faces, in which passion was extinct and nothing was\r\nleft of the drama but the cords and pulleys and bare mechanism. Mme. de\r\nBeauseant’s counsels, the words uttered in anger by the forsaken lady,\r\nher petulant offer, came to his mind, and poverty was a ready expositor.\r\nRastignac determined to open two parallel trenches so as to insure\r\nsuccess; he would be a learned doctor of law and a man of fashion.\r\nClearly he was still a child! Those two lines are asymptotes, and will\r\nnever meet.\r\n\r\n“You are very dull, my lord Marquis,” said Vautrin, with one of the\r\nshrewd glances that seem to read the innermost secrets of another mind.\r\n\r\n“I am not in the humor to stand jokes from people who call me ‘my lord\r\nMarquis,’” answered Eugene. “A marquis here in Paris, if he is not the\r\nveriest sham, ought to have a hundred thousand livres a year at least;\r\nand a lodger in the Maison Vauquer is not exactly Fortune’s favorite.”\r\n\r\nVautrin’s glance at Rastignac was half-paternal, half-contemptuous.\r\n“Puppy!” it seemed to say; “I should make one mouthful of him!” Then he\r\nanswered:\r\n\r\n“You are in a bad humor; perhaps your visit to the beautiful Comtesse de\r\nRestaud was not a success.”\r\n\r\n“She has shut her door against me because I told her that her father\r\ndined at our table,” cried Rastignac.\r\n\r\nGlances were exchanged all round the room; Father Goriot looked down.\r\n\r\n“You have sent some snuff into my eye,” he said to his neighbor, turning\r\na little aside to rub his hand over his face.\r\n\r\n“Any one who molests Father Goriot will have henceforward to reckon with\r\nme,” said Eugene, looking at the old man’s neighbor; “he is worth all\r\nthe rest of us put together.--I am not speaking of the ladies,” he\r\nadded, turning in the direction of Mlle. Taillefer.\r\n\r\nEugene’s remarks produced a sensation, and his tone silenced the\r\ndinner-table. Vautrin alone spoke. “If you are going to champion Father\r\nGoriot, and set up for his responsible editor into the bargain, you\r\nhad need be a crack shot and know how to handle the foils,” he said,\r\nbanteringly.\r\n\r\n“So I intend,” said Eugene.\r\n\r\n“Then you are taking the field to-day?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” Rastignac answered. “But I owe no account of myself to any\r\none, especially as I do not try to find out what other people do of a\r\nnight.”\r\n\r\nVautrin looked askance at Rastignac.\r\n\r\n“If you do not mean to be deceived by the puppets, my boy, you must\r\ngo behind and see the whole show, and not peep through holes in the\r\ncurtain. That is enough,” he added, seeing that Eugene was about to fly\r\ninto a passion. “We can have a little talk whenever you like.”\r\n\r\nThere was a general feeling of gloom and constraint. Father Goriot was\r\nso deeply dejected by the student’s remark that he did not notice the\r\nchange in the disposition of his fellow-lodgers, nor know that he had\r\nmet with a champion capable of putting an end to the persecution.\r\n\r\n“Then, M. Goriot sitting there is the father of a countess,” said Mme.\r\nVauquer in a low voice.\r\n\r\n“And of a baroness,” answered Rastignac.\r\n\r\n“That is about all he is capable of,” said Bianchon to Rastignac; “I\r\nhave taken a look at his head; there is only one bump--the bump of\r\nPaternity; he must be an _eternal father_.”\r\n\r\nEugene was too intent on his thoughts to laugh at Bianchon’s joke. He\r\ndetermined to profit by Mme. de Beauseant’s counsels, and was asking\r\nhimself how he could obtain the necessary money. He grew grave. The wide\r\nsavannas of the world stretched before his eyes; all things lay before\r\nhim, nothing was his. Dinner came to an end, the others went, and he was\r\nleft in the dining-room.\r\n\r\n“So you have seen my daughter?” Goriot spoke tremulously, and the sound\r\nof his voice broke in upon Eugene’s dreams. The young man took the\r\nelder’s hand, and looked at him with something like kindness in his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n“You are a good and noble man,” he said. “We will have some talk about\r\nyour daughters by and by.”\r\n\r\nHe rose without waiting for Goriot’s answer, and went to his room. There\r\nhe wrote the following letter to his mother:--\r\n\r\n\r\n “My Dear Mother,--Can you nourish your child from your breast\r\n  again? I am in a position to make a rapid fortune, but I want\r\n  twelve hundred francs--I must have them at all costs. Say nothing\r\n  about this to my father; perhaps he might make objections, and\r\n  unless I have the money, I may be led to put an end to myself, and\r\n  so escape the clutches of despair. I will tell you everything when\r\n  I see you. I will not begin to try to describe my present\r\n  situation; it would take volumes to put the whole story clearly\r\n  and fully. I have not been gambling, my kind mother, I owe no one\r\n  a penny; but if you would preserve the life that you gave me, you\r\n  must send me the sum I mention. As a matter of fact, I go to see\r\n  the Vicomtesse de Beauseant; she is using her influence for me; I\r\n  am obliged to go into society, and I have not a penny to lay out\r\n  on clean gloves. I can manage to exist on bread and water, or go\r\n  without food, if need be, but I cannot do without the tools with\r\n  which they cultivate the vineyards in this country. I must\r\n  resolutely make up my mind at once to make my way, or stick in the\r\n  mire for the rest of my days. I know that all your hopes are set\r\n  on me, and I want to realize them quickly. Sell some of your old\r\n  jewelry, my kind mother; I will give you other jewels very soon. I\r\n  know enough of our affairs at home to know all that such a\r\n  sacrifice means, and you must not think that I would lightly ask\r\n  you to make it; I should be a monster if I could. You must think\r\n  of my entreaty as a cry forced from me by imperative necessity.\r\n  Our whole future lies in the subsidy with which I must begin my\r\n  first campaign, for life in Paris is one continual battle. If you\r\n  cannot otherwise procure the whole of the money, and are forced to\r\n  sell our aunt’s lace, tell her that I will send her some still\r\n  handsomer,” and so forth.\r\n\r\nHe wrote to ask each of his sisters for their savings--would they\r\ndespoil themselves for him, and keep the sacrifice a secret from the\r\nfamily? To his request he knew that they would not fail to respond\r\ngladly, and he added to it an appeal to their delicacy by touching the\r\nchord of honor that vibrates so loudly in young and high-strung natures.\r\n\r\nYet when he had written the letters, he could not help feeling\r\nmisgivings in spite of his youthful ambition; his heart beat fast, and\r\nhe trembled. He knew the spotless nobleness of the lives buried away in\r\nthe lonely manor house; he knew what trouble and what joy his request\r\nwould cause his sisters, and how happy they would be as they talked\r\nat the bottom of the orchard of that dear brother of theirs in Paris.\r\nVisions rose before his eyes; a sudden strong light revealed his\r\nsisters secretly counting over their little store, devising some girlish\r\nstratagem by which the money could be sent to him _incognito_, essaying,\r\nfor the first time in their lives, a piece of deceit that reached the\r\nsublime in its unselfishness.\r\n\r\n“A sister’s heart is a diamond for purity, a deep sea of tenderness!” he\r\nsaid to himself. He felt ashamed of those letters.\r\n\r\nWhat power there must be in the petitions put up by such hearts;\r\nhow pure the fervor that bears their souls to Heaven in prayer! What\r\nexquisite joy they would find in self-sacrifice! What a pang for his\r\nmother’s heart if she could not send him all that he asked for! And this\r\nnoble affection, these sacrifices made at such terrible cost, were to\r\nserve as the ladder by which he meant to climb to Delphine de Nucingen.\r\nA few tears, like the last grains of incense flung upon the sacred\r\nalter fire of the hearth, fell from his eyes. He walked up and down,\r\nand despair mingled with his emotion. Father Goriot saw him through the\r\nhalf-open door.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter, sir?” he asked from the threshold.\r\n\r\n“Ah! my good neighbor, I am as much a son and brother as you are a\r\nfather. You do well to fear for the Comtesse Anastasie; there is one M.\r\nMaxime de Trailles, who will be her ruin.”\r\n\r\nFather Goriot withdrew, stammering some words, but Eugene failed to\r\ncatch their meaning.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Rastignac went out to post his letters. Up to the last\r\nmoment he wavered and doubted, but he ended by flinging them into the\r\nbox. “I shall succeed!” he said to himself. So says the gambler; so says\r\nthe great captain; but the three words that have been the salvation of\r\nsome few, have been the ruin of many more.\r\n\r\nA few days after this Eugene called at Mme. de Restaud’s house; she was\r\nnot at home. Three times he tried the experiment, and three times he\r\nfound her doors closed against him, though he was careful to choose an\r\nhour when M. de Trailles was not there. The Vicomtesse was right.\r\n\r\nThe student studied no longer. He put in an appearance at lectures\r\nsimply to answer to his name, and after thus attesting his presence,\r\ndeparted forthwith. He had been through a reasoning process familiar to\r\nmost students. He had seen the advisability of deferring his studies\r\nto the last moment before going up for his examinations; he made up his\r\nmind to cram his second and third years’ work into the third year, when\r\nhe meant to begin to work in earnest, and to complete his studies in law\r\nwith one great effort. In the meantime he had fifteen months in which to\r\nnavigate the ocean of Paris, to spread the nets and set the lines that\r\nwould bring him a protectress and a fortune. Twice during that week he\r\nsaw Mme. de Beauseant; he did not go to her house until he had seen the\r\nMarquis d’Ajuda drive away.\r\n\r\nVictory for yet a few more days was with the great lady, the most poetic\r\nfigure in the Faubourg Saint-Germain; and the marriage of the Marquis\r\nd’Ajuda-Pinto with Mlle. de Rochefide was postponed. The dread of losing\r\nher happiness filled those days with a fever of joy unknown before,\r\nbut the end was only so much the nearer. The Marquis d’Ajuda and the\r\nRochefides agreed that this quarrel and reconciliation was a very\r\nfortunate thing; Mme. de Beauseant (so they hoped) would gradually\r\nbecome reconciled to the idea of the marriage, and in the end would be\r\nbrought to sacrifice d’Ajuda’s morning visits to the exigencies of a\r\nman’s career, exigencies which she must have foreseen. In spite of the\r\nmost solemn promises, daily renewed, M. d’Ajuda was playing a part,\r\nand the Vicomtesse was eager to be deceived. “Instead of taking a leap\r\nheroically from the window, she is falling headlong down the staircase,”\r\n said her most intimate friend, the Duchesse de Langeais. Yet this\r\nafter-glow of happiness lasted long enough for the Vicomtesse to be of\r\nservice to her young cousin. She had a half-superstitious affection for\r\nhim. Eugene had shown her sympathy and devotion at a crisis when a woman\r\nsees no pity, no real comfort in any eyes; when if a man is ready with\r\nsoothing flatteries, it is because he has an interested motive.\r\n\r\nRastignac made up his mind that he must learn the whole of Goriot’s\r\nprevious history; he would come to his bearings before attempting to\r\nboard the Maison de Nucingen. The results of his inquiries may be given\r\nbriefly as follows:--\r\n\r\nIn the days before the Revolution, Jean-Joachim Goriot was simply a\r\nworkman in the employ of a vermicelli maker. He was a skilful, thrifty\r\nworkman, sufficiently enterprising to buy his master’s business when\r\nthe latter fell a chance victim to the disturbances of 1789. Goriot\r\nestablished himself in the Rue de la Jussienne, close to the Corn\r\nExchange. His plain good sense led him to accept the position of\r\nPresident of the Section, so as to secure for his business the\r\nprotection of those in power at that dangerous epoch. This prudent step\r\nhad led to success; the foundations of his fortune were laid in the time\r\nof the Scarcity (real or artificial), when the price of grain of all\r\nkinds rose enormously in Paris. People used to fight for bread at the\r\nbakers’ doors; while other persons went to the grocers’ shops and bought\r\nItalian paste foods without brawling over it. It was during this year\r\nthat Goriot made the money, which, at a later time, was to give him\r\nall the advantage of the great capitalist over the small buyer; he had,\r\nmoreover, the usual luck of average ability; his mediocrity was the\r\nsalvation of him. He excited no one’s envy, it was not even suspected\r\nthat he was rich till the peril of being rich was over, and all his\r\nintelligence was concentrated, not on political, but on commercial\r\nspeculations. Goriot was an authority second to none on all questions\r\nrelating to corn, flour, and “middlings”; and the production, storage,\r\nand quality of grain. He could estimate the yield of the harvest, and\r\nforesee market prices; he bought his cereals in Sicily, and imported\r\nUkrainian wheat. Any one who had heard him hold forth on the regulations\r\nthat control the importation and exportation of grain, who had seen his\r\ngrasp of the subject, his clear insight into the principles involved,\r\nhis appreciation of weak points in the way that the system worked,\r\nwould have thought that here was the stuff of which a minister is made.\r\nPatient, active, and persevering, energetic and prompt in action, he\r\nsurveyed his business horizon with an eagle eye. Nothing there took him\r\nby surprise; he foresaw all things, knew all that was happening, and\r\nkept his own counsel; he was a diplomatist in his quick comprehension\r\nof a situation; and in the routine of business he was as patient and\r\nplodding as a soldier on the march. But beyond this business horizon he\r\ncould not see. He used to spend his hours of leisure on the threshold of\r\nhis shop, leaning against the framework of the door. Take him from\r\nhis dark little counting-house, and he became once more the rough,\r\nslow-witted workman, a man who cannot understand a piece of reasoning,\r\nwho is indifferent to all intellectual pleasures, and falls asleep at\r\nthe play, a Parisian Dolibom in short, against whose stupidity other\r\nminds are powerless.\r\n\r\nNatures of this kind are nearly all alike; in almost all of them you\r\nwill find some hidden depth of sublime affection. Two all-absorbing\r\naffections filled the vermicelli maker’s heart to the exclusion of every\r\nother feeling; into them he seemed to put all the forces of his nature,\r\nas he put the whole power of his brain into the corn trade. He had\r\nregarded his wife, the only daughter of a rich farmer of La Brie, with a\r\ndevout admiration; his love for her had been boundless. Goriot had\r\nfelt the charm of a lovely and sensitive nature, which, in its delicate\r\nstrength, was the very opposite of his own. Is there any instinct more\r\ndeeply implanted in the heart of man than the pride of protection, a\r\nprotection which is constantly exerted for a fragile and defenceless\r\ncreature? Join love thereto, the warmth of gratitude that all generous\r\nsouls feel for the source of their pleasures, and you have the\r\nexplanation of many strange incongruities in human nature.\r\n\r\nAfter seven years of unclouded happiness, Goriot lost his wife. It was\r\nvery unfortunate for him. She was beginning to gain an ascendency over\r\nhim in other ways; possibly she might have brought that barren soil\r\nunder cultivation, she might have widened his ideas and given other\r\ndirections to his thoughts. But when she was dead, the instinct of\r\nfatherhood developed in him till it almost became a mania. All the\r\naffection balked by death seemed to turn to his daughters, and he found\r\nfull satisfaction for his heart in loving them. More or less brilliant\r\nproposals were made to him from time to time; wealthy merchants or\r\nfarmers with daughters vied with each other in offering inducements\r\nto him to marry again; but he determined to remain a widower. His\r\nfather-in-law, the only man for whom he felt a decided friendship, gave\r\nout that Goriot had made a vow to be faithful to his wife’s memory. The\r\nfrequenters of the Corn Exchange, who could not comprehend this sublime\r\npiece of folly, joked about it among themselves, and found a ridiculous\r\nnickname for him. One of them ventured (after a glass over a bargain)\r\nto call him by it, and a blow from the vermicelli maker’s fist sent him\r\nheadlong into a gutter in the Rue Oblin. He could think of nothing else\r\nwhen his children were concerned; his love for them made him fidgety\r\nand anxious; and this was so well known, that one day a competitor, who\r\nwished to get rid of him to secure the field to himself, told Goriot\r\nthat Delphine had just been knocked down by a cab. The vermicelli maker\r\nturned ghastly pale, left the Exchange at once, and did not return for\r\nseveral days afterwards; he was ill in consequence of the shock and the\r\nsubsequent relief on discovering that it was a false alarm. This time,\r\nhowever, the offender did not escape with a bruised shoulder; at a\r\ncritical moment in the man’s affairs, Goriot drove him into bankruptcy,\r\nand forced him to disappear from the Corn Exchange.\r\n\r\nAs might have been expected, the two girls were spoiled. With an income\r\nof sixty thousand francs, Goriot scarcely spent twelve hundred on\r\nhimself, and found all his happiness in satisfying the whims of the two\r\ngirls. The best masters were engaged, that Anastasie and Delphine\r\nmight be endowed with all the accomplishments which distinguish a good\r\neducation. They had a chaperon--luckily for them, she was a woman\r\nwho had good sense and good taste;--they learned to ride; they had a\r\ncarriage for their use; they lived as the mistress of a rich old lord\r\nmight live; they had only to express a wish, their father would hasten\r\nto give them their most extravagant desires, and asked nothing of them\r\nin return but a kiss. Goriot had raised the two girls to the level of\r\nthe angels; and, quite naturally, he himself was left beneath them. Poor\r\nman! he loved them even for the pain that they gave him.\r\n\r\nWhen the girls were old enough to be married, they were left free to\r\nchoose for themselves. Each had half her father’s fortune as her dowry;\r\nand when the Comte de Restaud came to woo Anastasie for her beauty,\r\nher social aspirations led her to leave her father’s house for a more\r\nexalted sphere. Delphine wished for money; she married Nucingen, a\r\nbanker of German extraction, who became a Baron of the Holy Roman\r\nEmpire. Goriot remained a vermicelli maker as before. His daughters\r\nand his sons-in-law began to demur; they did not like to see him still\r\nengaged in trade, though his whole life was bound up with his business.\r\nFor five years he stood out against their entreaties, then he yielded,\r\nand consented to retire on the amount realized by the sale of his\r\nbusiness and the savings of the last few years. It was this capital\r\nthat Mme. Vauquer, in the early days of his residence with her, had\r\ncalculated would bring in eight or ten thousand livres in a year. He had\r\ntaken refuge in her lodging-house, driven there by despair when he knew\r\nthat his daughters were compelled by their husbands not only to refuse\r\nto receive him as an inmate in their houses, but even to see him no more\r\nexcept in private.\r\n\r\nThis was all the information which Rastignac gained from a M. Muret\r\nwho had purchased Goriot’s business, information which confirmed\r\nthe Duchesse de Langeais’ suppositions, and herewith the preliminary\r\nexplanation of this obscure but terrible Parisian tragedy comes to an\r\nend.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the first week in December Rastignac received two\r\nletters--one from his mother, and one from his eldest sister. His heart\r\nbeat fast, half with happiness, half with fear, at the sight of the\r\nfamiliar handwriting. Those two little scraps of paper contained life\r\nor death for his hopes. But while he felt a shiver of dread as he\r\nremembered their dire poverty at home, he knew their love for him so\r\nwell that he could not help fearing that he was draining their very\r\nlife-blood. His mother’s letter ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n “MY DEAR CHILD,--I am sending you the money that you asked for.\r\n  Make a good use of it. Even to save your life I could not raise so\r\n  large a sum a second time without your father’s knowledge, and\r\n  there would be trouble about it. We should be obliged to mortgage\r\n  the land. It is impossible to judge of the merits of schemes of\r\n  which I am ignorant; but what sort of schemes can they be, that\r\n  you should fear to tell me about them? Volumes of explanation\r\n  would not have been needed; we mothers can understand at a word,\r\n  and that word would have spared me the anguish of uncertainty. I\r\n  do not know how to hide the painful impression that your letter\r\n  has made upon me, my dear son. What can you have felt when you\r\n  were moved to send this chill of dread through my heart? It must\r\n  have been very painful to you to write the letter that gave me so\r\n  much pain as I read it. To what courses are you committed? You are\r\n  going to appear to be something that you are not, and your whole\r\n  life and success depends upon this? You are about to see a society\r\n  into which you cannot enter without rushing into expense that you\r\n  cannot afford, without losing precious time that is needed for\r\n  your studies. Ah! my dear Eugene, believe your mother, crooked\r\n  ways cannot lead to great ends. Patience and endurance are the two\r\n  qualities most needed in your position. I am not scolding you; I\r\n  do not want any tinge of bitterness to spoil our offering. I am\r\n  only talking like a mother whose trust in you is as great as her\r\n  foresight for you. You know the steps that you must take, and I,\r\n  for my part, know the purity of heart, and how good your\r\n  intentions are; so I can say to you without a doubt, ‘Go forward,\r\n  beloved!’ If I tremble, it is because I am a mother, but my\r\n  prayers and blessings will be with you at every step. Be very\r\n  careful, dear boy. You must have a man’s prudence, for it lies\r\n  with you to shape the destinies of five others who are dear to\r\n  you, and must look to you. Yes, our fortunes depend upon you, and\r\n  your success is ours. We all pray to God to be with you in all\r\n  that you do. Your aunt Marcillac has been most generous beyond\r\n  words in this matter; she saw at once how it was, even down to\r\n  your gloves. ‘But I have a weakness for the eldest!’ she said\r\n  gaily. You must love your aunt very much, dear Eugene. I shall\r\n  wait till you have succeeded before telling you all that she has\r\n  done for you, or her money would burn your fingers. You, who are\r\n  young, do not know what it is to part with something that is a\r\n  piece of your past! But what would we not sacrifice for your\r\n  sakes? Your aunt says that I am to send you a kiss on the forehead\r\n  from her, and that kiss is to bring you luck again and again, she\r\n  says. She would have written you herself, the dear kind-hearted\r\n  woman, but she is troubled with the gout in her fingers just now.\r\n  Your father is very well. The vintage of 1819 has turned out\r\n  better than we expected. Good-bye, dear boy; I will say nothing\r\n  about your sisters, because Laure is writing to you, and I must\r\n  let her have the pleasure of giving you all the home news. Heaven\r\n  send that you may succeed! Oh! yes, dear Eugene, you must succeed.\r\n  I have come, through you, to a knowledge of a pain so sharp that I\r\n  do not think I could endure it a second time. I have come to know\r\n  what it is to be poor, and to long for money for my children’s\r\n  sake. There, good-bye! Do not leave us for long without news of\r\n  you; and here, at the last, take a kiss from your mother.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the time Eugene had finished the letter he was in tears. He thought\r\nof Father Goriot crushing his silver keepsake into a shapeless mass\r\nbefore he sold it to meet his daughter’s bill of exchange.\r\n\r\n“Your mother has broken up her jewels for you,” he said to himself;\r\n“your aunt shed tears over those relics of hers before she sold them\r\nfor your sake. What right have you to heap execrations on Anastasie? You\r\nhave followed her example; you have selfishly sacrificed others to your\r\nown future, and she sacrifices her father to her lover; and of you two,\r\nwhich is the worse?”\r\n\r\nHe was ready to renounce his attempts; he could not bear to take\r\nthat money. The fires of remorse burned in his heart, and gave him\r\nintolerable pain, the generous secret remorse which men seldom take into\r\naccount when they sit in judgment upon their fellow-men; but perhaps\r\nthe angels in heaven, beholding it, pardon the criminal whom our justice\r\ncondemns. Rastignac opened his sister’s letter; its simplicity and\r\nkindness revived his heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n “Your letter came just at the right time, dear brother. Agathe and\r\n  I had thought of so many different ways of spending our money,\r\n  that we did not know what to buy with it; and now you have come\r\n  in, and, like the servant who upset all the watches that belonged\r\n  to the King of Spain, you have restored harmony; for, really and\r\n  truly, we did not know which of all the things we wanted we wanted\r\n  most, and we were always quarreling about it, never thinking, dear\r\n  Eugene, of a way of spending our money which would satisfy us\r\n  completely. Agathe jumped for you. Indeed, we have been like two\r\n  mad things all day, ‘to such a prodigious degree’ (as aunt would\r\n  say), that mother said, with her severe expression, ‘Whatever can\r\n  be the matter with you, mesdemoiselles?’ I think if we had been\r\n  scolded a little, we should have been still better pleased. A\r\n  woman ought to be very glad to suffer for one she loves! I,\r\n  however, in my inmost soul, was doleful and cross in the midst of\r\n  all my joy. I shall make a bad wife, I am afraid, I am too fond of\r\n  spending. I had bought two sashes and a nice little stiletto for\r\n  piercing eyelet-holes in my stays, trifles that I really did not\r\n  want, so that I have less than that slow-coach Agathe, who is so\r\n  economical, and hoards her money like a magpie. She had two\r\n  hundred francs! And I have only one hundred and fifty! I am nicely\r\n  punished; I could throw my sash down the well; it will be painful\r\n  to me to wear it now. Poor dear, I have robbed you. And Agathe was\r\n  so nice about it. She said, ‘Let us send the three hundred and\r\n  fifty francs in our two names!’ But I could not help telling you\r\n  everything just as it happened.\r\n\r\n “Do you know how we managed to keep your commandments? We took our\r\n  glittering hoard, we went out for a walk, and when once fairly on\r\n  the highway we ran all the way to Ruffec, where we handed over the\r\n  coin, without more ado, to M. Grimbert of the Messageries Royales.\r\n  We came back again like swallows on the wing. ‘Don’t you think\r\n  that happiness has made us lighter?’ Agathe said. We said all\r\n  sorts of things, which I shall not tell you, Monsieur le Parisien,\r\n  because they were all about you. Oh, we love you dearly, dear\r\n  brother; it was all summed up in those few words. As for keeping\r\n  the secret, little masqueraders like us are capable of anything\r\n  (according to our aunt), even of holding our tongues. Our mother\r\n  has been on a mysterious journey to Angouleme, and the aunt went\r\n  with her, not without solemn councils, from which we were shut\r\n  out, and M. le Baron likewise. They are silent as to the weighty\r\n  political considerations that prompted their mission, and\r\n  conjectures are rife in the State of Rastignac. The Infantas are\r\n  embroidering a muslin robe with open-work sprigs for her Majesty\r\n  the Queen; the work progresses in the most profound secrecy. There\r\n  be but two more breadths to finish. A decree has gone forth that\r\n  no wall shall be built on the side of Verteuil, but that a hedge\r\n  shall be planted instead thereof. Our subjects may sustain some\r\n  disappointment of fruit and espaliers, but strangers will enjoy\r\n  a fair prospect. Should the heir-presumptive lack\r\n  pocket-handkerchiefs, be it known unto him that the dowager Lady\r\n  of Marcillac, exploring the recesses of her drawers and boxes\r\n  (known respectively as Pompeii and Herculaneum), having brought to\r\n  light a fair piece of cambric whereof she wotted not, the Princesses\r\n  Agathe and Laure place at their brother’s disposal their thread,\r\n  their needles, and hands somewhat of the reddest. The two young\r\n  Princes, Don Henri and Don Gabriel, retain their fatal habits of\r\n  stuffing themselves with grape-jelly, of teasing their sisters, of\r\n  taking their pleasure by going a-bird-nesting, and of cutting\r\n  switches for themselves from the osier-beds, maugre the laws of\r\n  the realm. Moreover, they list not to learn naught, wherefore the\r\n  Papal Nuncio (called of the commonalty, M. le Cure) threateneth\r\n  them with excommunication, since that they neglect the sacred\r\n  canons of grammatical construction for the construction of other\r\n  canon, deadly engines made of the stems of elder.\r\n\r\n “Farewell, dear brother, never did letter carry so many wishes for\r\n  your success, so much love fully satisfied. You will have a great\r\n  deal to tell us when you come home! You will tell me everything,\r\n  won’t you? I am the oldest. From something the aunt let fall, we\r\n  think you must have had some success.\r\n\r\n “Something was said of a lady, but nothing more was said...\r\n\r\n “Of course not, in our family! Oh, by-the-by, Eugene, would you\r\n  rather that we made that piece of cambric into shirts for you\r\n  instead of pocket-handkerchiefs? If you want some really nice\r\n  shirts at once, we ought to lose no time in beginning upon them;\r\n  and if the fashion is different now in Paris, send us one for a\r\n  pattern; we want more particularly to know about the cuffs. Good-\r\n  bye! Good-bye! Take my kiss on the left side of your forehead, on\r\n  the temple that belongs to me, and to no one else in the world. I\r\n  am leaving the other side of the sheet for Agathe, who has\r\n  solemnly promised not to read a word that I have written; but, all\r\n  the same, I mean to sit by her side while she writes, so as to be\r\n  quite sure that she keeps her word.--Your loving sister,\r\n\r\n                                           “LAURE DE RASTIGNAC.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Yes!” said Eugene to himself. “Yes! Success at all costs now! Riches\r\ncould not repay such devotion as this. I wish I could give them every\r\nsort of happiness! Fifteen hundred and fifty francs,” he went on after a\r\npause. “Every shot must go to the mark! Laure is right. Trust a woman!\r\nI have only calico shirts. Where some one else’s welfare is concerned, a\r\nyoung girl becomes as ingenious as a thief. Guileless where she herself\r\nis in question, and full of foresight for me,--she is like a heavenly\r\nangel forgiving the strange incomprehensible sins of earth.”\r\n\r\nThe world lay before him. His tailor had been summoned and sounded, and\r\nhad finally surrendered. When Rastignac met M. de Trailles, he had seen\r\nat once how great a part the tailor plays in a young man’s career; a\r\ntailor is either a deadly enemy or a staunch friend, with an invoice\r\nfor a bond of friendship; between these two extremes there is, alack! no\r\nmiddle term. In this representative of his craft Eugene discovered a man\r\nwho understood that his was a sort of paternal function for young men\r\nat their entrance into life, who regarded himself as a stepping-stone\r\nbetween a young man’s present and future. And Rastignac in gratitude\r\nmade the man’s fortune by an epigram of a kind in which he excelled at a\r\nlater period of his life.\r\n\r\n“I have twice known a pair of trousers turned out by him make a match of\r\ntwenty thousand livres a year!”\r\n\r\nFifteen hundred francs, and as many suits of clothes as he chose to\r\norder! At that moment the poor child of the South felt no more doubts of\r\nany kind. The young man went down to breakfast with the indefinable air\r\nwhich the consciousness of the possession of money gives to youth. No\r\nsooner are the coins slipped into a student’s pocket than his wealth,\r\nin imagination at least, is piled into a fantastic column, which affords\r\nhim a moral support. He begins to hold up his head as he walks; he is\r\nconscious that he has a means of bringing his powers to bear on a given\r\npoint; he looks you straight in the face; his gestures are quick and\r\ndecided; only yesterday he was diffident and shy, any one might have\r\npushed him aside; to-morrow, he will take the wall of a prime minister.\r\nA miracle has been wrought in him. Nothing is beyond the reach of\r\nhis ambition, and his ambition soars at random; he is light-hearted,\r\ngenerous, and enthusiastic; in short, the fledgling bird has discovered\r\nthat he has wings. A poor student snatches at every chance pleasure\r\nmuch as a dog runs all sorts of risks to steal a bone, cracking it and\r\nsucking the marrow as he flies from pursuit; but a young man who can\r\nrattle a few runaway gold coins in his pocket can take his pleasure\r\ndeliberately, can taste the whole of the sweets of secure possession; he\r\nsoars far above earth; he has forgotten what the word _poverty_ means;\r\nall Paris is his. Those are days when the whole world shines radiant\r\nwith light, when everything glows and sparkles before the eyes of youth,\r\ndays that bring joyous energy that is never brought into harness, days\r\nof debts and of painful fears that go hand in hand with every delight.\r\nThose who do not know the left bank of the Seine between the Rue\r\nSaint-Jacques and the Rue des Saints-Peres know nothing of life.\r\n\r\n“Ah! if the women of Paris but knew,” said Rastignac, as he devoured\r\nMme. Vauquer’s stewed pears (at five for a penny), “they would come here\r\nin search of a lover.”\r\n\r\nJust then a porter from the Messageries Royales appeared at the door of\r\nthe room; they had previously heard the bell ring as the wicket opened\r\nto admit him. The man asked for M. Eugene de Rastignac, holding out two\r\nbags for him to take, and a form of receipt for his signature. Vautrin’s\r\nkeen glance cut Eugene like a lash.\r\n\r\n“Now you will be able to pay for those fencing lessons and go to the\r\nshooting gallery,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Your ship has come in,” said Mme. Vauquer, eyeing the bags.\r\n\r\nMlle. Michonneau did not dare to look at the money, for fear her eyes\r\nshould betray her cupidity.\r\n\r\n“You have a kind mother,” said Mme. Couture.\r\n\r\n“You have a kind mother, sir,” echoed Poiret.\r\n\r\n“Yes, mamma has been drained dry,” said Vautrin, “and now you can have\r\nyour fling, go into society, and fish for heiresses, and dance with\r\ncountesses who have peach blossom in their hair. But take my advice,\r\nyoung man, and don’t neglect your pistol practice.”\r\n\r\nVautrin struck an attitude, as if he were facing an antagonist.\r\nRastignac, meaning to give the porter a tip, felt in his pockets and\r\nfound nothing. Vautrin flung down a franc piece on the table.\r\n\r\n“Your credit is good,” he remarked, eyeing the student, and Rastignac\r\nwas forced to thank him, though, since the sharp encounter of wits at\r\ndinner that day, after Eugene came in from calling on Mme. de Beauseant,\r\nhe had made up his mind that Vautrin was insufferable. For a week, in\r\nfact, they had both kept silence in each other’s presence, and watched\r\neach other. The student tried in vain to account to himself for this\r\nattitude.\r\n\r\nAn idea, of course, gains in force by the energy with which it\r\nis expressed; it strikes where the brain sends it, by a law as\r\nmathematically exact as the law that determines the course of a shell\r\nfrom a mortar. The amount of impression it makes is not to be determined\r\nso exactly. Sometimes, in an impressible nature, the idea works havoc,\r\nbut there are, no less, natures so robustly protected, that this sort\r\nof projectile falls flat and harmless on skulls of triple brass,\r\nas cannon-shot against solid masonry; then there are flaccid and\r\nspongy-fibred natures into which ideas from without sink like spent\r\nbullets into the earthworks of a redoubt. Rastignac’s head was something\r\nof the powder-magazine order; the least shock sufficed to bring about an\r\nexplosion. He was too quick, too young, not to be readily accessible\r\nto ideas; and open to that subtle influence of thought and feeling in\r\nothers which causes so many strange phenomena that make an impression\r\nupon us of which we are all unconscious at the time. Nothing escaped his\r\nmental vision; he was lynx-eyed; in him the mental powers of perception,\r\nwhich seem like duplicates of the senses, had the mysterious power\r\nof swift projection that astonishes us in intellects of a high\r\norder--slingers who are quick to detect the weak spot in any armor.\r\n\r\nIn the past month Eugene’s good qualities and defects had rapidly\r\ndeveloped with his character. Intercourse with the world and the\r\nendeavor to satisfy his growing desires had brought out his defects.\r\nBut Rastignac came from the South side of the Loire, and had the good\r\nqualities of his countrymen. He had the impetuous courage of the South,\r\nthat rushes to the attack of a difficulty, as well as the southern\r\nimpatience of delay or suspense. These traits are held to be defects in\r\nthe North; they made the fortune of Murat, but they likewise cut short\r\nhis career. The moral would appear to be that when the dash and boldness\r\nof the South side of the Loire meets, in a southern temperament, with\r\nthe guile of the North, the character is complete, and such a man will\r\ngain (and keep) the crown of Sweden.\r\n\r\nRastignac, therefore, could not stand the fire from Vautrin’s batteries\r\nfor long without discovering whether this was a friend or a foe. He felt\r\nas if this strange being was reading his inmost soul, and dissecting\r\nhis feelings, while Vautrin himself was so close and secretive that\r\nhe seemed to have something of the profound and unmoved serenity of\r\na sphinx, seeing and hearing all things and saying nothing. Eugene,\r\nconscious of that money in his pocket, grew rebellious.\r\n\r\n“Be so good as to wait a moment,” he said to Vautrin, as the latter\r\nrose, after slowly emptying his coffee-cup, sip by sip.\r\n\r\n“What for?” inquired the older man, as he put on his large-brimmed hat\r\nand took up the sword-cane that he was wont to twirl like a man who will\r\nface three or four footpads without flinching.\r\n\r\n“I will repay you in a minute,” returned Eugene. He unsealed one of the\r\nbags as he spoke, counted out a hundred and forty francs, and pushed\r\nthem towards Mme. Vauquer. “Short reckonings make good friends” he\r\nadded, turning to the widow; “that clears our accounts till the end of\r\nthe year. Can you give me change for a five-franc piece?”\r\n\r\n“Good friends make short reckonings,” echoed Poiret, with a glance at\r\nVautrin.\r\n\r\n“Here is your franc,” said Rastignac, holding out the coin to the sphinx\r\nin the black wig.\r\n\r\n“Any one might think that you were afraid to owe me a trifle,” exclaimed\r\nthis latter, with a searching glance that seemed to read the young man’s\r\ninmost thoughts; there was a satirical and cynical smile on Vautrin’s\r\nface such as Eugene had seen scores of times already; every time he saw\r\nit, it exasperated him almost beyond endurance.\r\n\r\n“Well... so I am,” he answered. He held both the bags in his hand, and\r\nhad risen to go up to his room.\r\n\r\nVautrin made as if he were going out through the sitting-room, and the\r\nstudent turned to go through the second door that opened into the square\r\nlobby at the foot of the staircase.\r\n\r\n“Do you know, Monsieur le Marquis de Rastignacorama, that what you were\r\nsaying just now was not exactly polite?” Vautrin remarked, as he rattled\r\nhis sword-cane across the panels of the sitting-room door, and came up\r\nto the student.\r\n\r\nRastignac looked coolly at Vautrin, drew him to the foot of the\r\nstaircase, and shut the dining-room door. They were standing in the\r\nlittle square lobby between the kitchen and the dining-room; the place\r\nwas lighted by an iron-barred fanlight above a door that gave access\r\ninto the garden. Sylvie came out of her kitchen, and Eugene chose that\r\nmoment to say:\r\n\r\n“_Monsieur_ Vautrin, I am not a marquis, and my name is not\r\nRastignacorama.”\r\n\r\n“They will fight,” said Mlle. Michonneau, in an indifferent tone.\r\n\r\n“Fight!” echoed Poiret.\r\n\r\n“Not they,” replied Mme. Vauquer, lovingly fingering her pile of coins.\r\n\r\n“But there they are under the lime-trees,” cried Mlle. Victorine, who\r\nhad risen so that she might see out into the garden. “Poor young man! he\r\nwas in the right, after all.”\r\n\r\n“We must go upstairs, my pet,” said Mme. Couture; “it is no business of\r\nours.”\r\n\r\nAt the door, however, Mme. Couture and Victorine found their progress\r\nbarred by the portly form of Sylvie the cook.\r\n\r\n“What ever can have happened?” she said. “M. Vautrin said to M. Eugene,\r\n‘Let us have an explanation!’ then he took him by the arm, and there\r\nthey are, out among the artichokes.”\r\n\r\nVautrin came in while she was speaking. “Mamma Vauquer,” he said\r\nsmiling, “don’t frighten yourself at all. I am only going to try my\r\npistols under the lime-trees.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! monsieur,” cried Victorine, clasping her hands as she spoke, “why\r\ndo you want to kill M. Eugene?”\r\n\r\nVautrin stepped back a pace or two, and gazed at Victorine.\r\n\r\n“Oh! this is something fresh!” he exclaimed in a bantering tone, that\r\nbrought the color into the poor girl’s face. “That young fellow yonder\r\nis very nice, isn’t he?” he went on. “You have given me a notion, my\r\npretty child; I will make you both happy.”\r\n\r\nMme. Couture laid her hand on the arm of her ward, and drew the girl\r\naway, as she said in her ear:\r\n\r\n“Why, Victorine, I cannot imagine what has come over you this morning.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want any shots fired in my garden,” said Mme. Vauquer. “You\r\nwill frighten the neighborhood and bring the police up here all in a\r\nmoment.”\r\n\r\n“Come, keep cool, Mamma Vauquer,” answered Vautrin. “There, there; it’s\r\nall right; we will go to the shooting-gallery.”\r\n\r\nHe went back to Rastignac, laying his hand familiarly on the young man’s\r\narm.\r\n\r\n“When I have given you ocular demonstration of the fact that I can put\r\na bullet through the ace on a card five times running at thirty-five\r\npaces,” he said, “that won’t take away your appetite, I suppose? You\r\nlook to me to be inclined to be a trifle quarrelsome this morning, and\r\nas if you would rush on your death like a blockhead.”\r\n\r\n“Do you draw back?” asked Eugene.\r\n\r\n“Don’t try to raise my temperature,” answered Vautrin, “it is not cold\r\nthis morning. Let us go and sit over there,” he added, pointing to the\r\ngreen-painted garden seats; “no one can overhear us. I want a little\r\ntalk with you. You are not a bad sort of youngster, and I have no\r\nquarrel with you. I like you, take Trump--(confound it!)--take Vautrin’s\r\nword for it. What makes me like you? I will tell you by-and-by.\r\nMeantime, I can tell you that I know you as well as if I had made you\r\nmyself, as I will prove to you in a minute. Put down your bags,” he\r\ncontinued, pointing to the round table.\r\n\r\nRastignac deposited his money on the table, and sat down. He was\r\nconsumed with curiosity, which the sudden change in the manner of the\r\nman before him had excited to the highest pitch. Here was a strange\r\nbeing who, a moment ago, had talked of killing him, and now posed as his\r\nprotector.\r\n\r\n“You would like to know who I really am, what I was, and what I do now,”\r\n Vautrin went on. “You want to know too much, youngster. Come! come! keep\r\ncool! You will hear more astonishing things than that. I have had\r\nmy misfortunes. Just hear me out first, and you shall have your turn\r\nafterwards. Here is my past in three words. Who am I? Vautrin. What do\r\nI do? Just what I please. Let us change the subject. You want to know my\r\ncharacter. I am good-natured to those who do me a good turn, or to those\r\nwhose hearts speak to mine. These last may do anything they like with\r\nme; they may bruise my shins, and I shall not tell them to ‘mind what\r\nthey are about’; but, _nom d’une pipe_, the devil himself is not an\r\nuglier customer than I can be if people annoy me, or if I don’t happen\r\nto take to them; and you may just as well know at once that I think no\r\nmore of killing a man than of that,” and he spat before him as he spoke.\r\n“Only when it is absolutely necessary to do so, I do my best to kill him\r\nproperly. I am what you call an artist. I have read Benvenuto Cellini’s\r\n_Memoirs_, such as you see me; and, what is more, in Italian: A\r\nfine-spirited fellow he was! From him I learned to follow the example\r\nset us by Providence, who strikes us down at random, and to admire\r\nthe beautiful whenever and wherever it is found. And, setting other\r\nquestions aside, is it not a glorious part to play, when you pit\r\nyourself against mankind, and the luck is on your side? I have thought\r\na good deal about the constitution of your present social Dis-order. A\r\nduel is downright childish, my boy! utter nonsense and folly! When one\r\nof two living men must be got out of the way, none but an idiot\r\nwould leave chance to decide which it is to be; and in a duel it is a\r\ntoss-up--heads or tails--and there you are! Now I, for instance, can\r\nhit the ace in the middle of a card five times running, send one bullet\r\nafter another through the same hole, and at thirty-five paces, moreover!\r\nWith that little accomplishment you might think yourself certain of\r\nkilling your man, mightn’t you. Well, I have fired, at twenty paces, and\r\nmissed, and the rogue who had never handled a pistol in his life--look\r\nhere!”--(he unbuttoned his waistcoat and exposed his chest, covered,\r\nlike a bear’s back, with a shaggy fell; the student gave a startled\r\nshudder)--“he was a raw lad, but he made his mark on me,” the\r\nextraordinary man went on, drawing Rastignac’s fingers over a deep scar\r\non his breast. “But that happened when I myself was a mere boy; I was\r\none-and-twenty then (your age), and I had some beliefs left--in a\r\nwoman’s love, and in a pack of rubbish that you will be over head and\r\nears in directly. You and I were to have fought just now, weren’t we?\r\nYou might have killed me. Suppose that I were put under the earth, where\r\nwould you be? You would have to clear out of this, go to Switzerland,\r\ndraw on papa’s purse--and he has none too much in it as it is. I mean to\r\nopen your eyes to your real position, that is what I am going to do: but\r\nI shall do it from the point of view of a man who, after studying the\r\nworld very closely, sees that there are but two alternatives--stupid\r\nobedience or revolt. I obey nobody; is that clear? Now, do you know how\r\nmuch you will want at the pace you are going? A million; and promptly,\r\ntoo, or that little head of ours will be swaying to and fro in the\r\ndrag-nets at Saint-Cloud, while we are gone to find out whether or no\r\nthere is a Supreme Being. I will put you in the way of that million.”\r\n\r\nHe stopped for a moment and looked at Eugene.\r\n\r\n“Aha! you do not look so sourly at papa Vautrin now! At the mention of\r\nthe million you look like a young girl when somebody has said, ‘I will\r\ncome for you this evening!’ and she betakes herself to her toilette as a\r\ncat licks its whiskers over a saucer of milk. All right. Come, now, let\r\nus go into the question, young man; all between ourselves, you know.\r\nWe have a papa and mamma down yonder, a great-aunt, two sisters (aged\r\neighteen and seventeen), two young brothers (one fifteen, and the other\r\nten), that is about the roll-call of the crew. The aunt brings up the\r\ntwo sisters; the cure comes and teaches the boys Latin. Boiled chestnuts\r\nare oftener on the table than white bread. Papa makes a suit of clothes\r\nlast a long while; if mamma has a different dress winter and summer, it\r\nis about as much as she has; the sisters manage as best they can. I know\r\nall about it; I have lived in the south.\r\n\r\n“That is how things are at home. They send you twelve hundred francs a\r\nyear, and the whole property only brings in three thousand francs all\r\ntold. We have a cook and a manservant; papa is a baron, and we must keep\r\nup appearances. Then we have our ambitions; we are connected with the\r\nBeauseants, and we go afoot through the streets; we want to be rich,\r\nand we have not a penny; we eat Mme. Vauquer’s messes, and we like grand\r\ndinners in the Faubourg Saint-Germain; we sleep on a truckle-bed, and\r\ndream of a mansion! I do not blame you for wanting these things. What\r\nsort of men do the women run after? Men of ambition. Men of ambition\r\nhave stronger frames, their blood is richer in iron, their hearts are\r\nwarmer than those of ordinary men. Women feel that when their power is\r\ngreatest, they look their best, and that those are their happiest hours;\r\nthey like power in men, and prefer the strongest even if it is a power\r\nthat may be their own destruction. I am going to make an inventory of\r\nyour desires in order to put the question at issue before you. Here it\r\nis:--\r\n\r\n“We are as hungry as a wolf, and those newly-cut teeth of ours are\r\nsharp; what are we to do to keep the pot boiling? In the first place,\r\nwe have the Code to browse upon; it is not amusing, and we are none the\r\nwiser for it, but that cannot be helped. So far so good. We mean to make\r\nan advocate of ourselves with a prospect of one day being made President\r\nof a Court of Assize, when we shall send poor devils, our betters, to\r\nthe galleys with a T.F.[*] on their shoulders, so that the rich may be\r\nconvinced that they can sleep in peace. There is no fun in that; and you\r\nare a long while coming to it; for, to begin with, there are two years\r\nof nauseous drudgery in Paris, we see all the lollipops that we long for\r\nout of our reach. It is tiresome to want things and never to have them.\r\nIf you were a pallid creature of the mollusk order, you would have\r\nnothing to fear, but it is different when you have the hot blood of\r\na lion and are ready to get into a score of scrapes every day of your\r\nlife. This is the ghastliest form of torture known in this inferno of\r\nGod’s making, and you will give in to it. Or suppose that you are a good\r\nboy, drink nothing stronger than milk, and bemoan your hard lot; you,\r\nwith your generous nature, will endure hardships that would drive a dog\r\nmad, and make a start, after long waiting, as deputy to some rascal\r\nor other in a hole of a place where the Government will fling you a\r\nthousand francs a year like the scraps that are thrown to the butcher’s\r\ndog. Bark at thieves, plead the cause of the rich, send men of heart\r\nto the guillotine, that is your work! Many thanks! If you have no\r\ninfluence, you may rot in your provincial tribunal. At thirty you will\r\nbe a Justice with twelve hundred francs a year (if you have not flung\r\noff the gown for good before then). By the time you are forty you may\r\nlook to marry a miller’s daughter, an heiress with some six thousand\r\nlivres a year. Much obliged! If you have influence, you may possibly\r\nbe a Public Prosecutor by the time you are thirty; with a salary of\r\na thousand crowns, you could look to marry the mayor’s daughter. Some\r\npetty piece of political trickery, such as mistaking Villele for Manuel\r\nin a bulletin (the names rhyme, and that quiets your conscience), and\r\nyou will probably be a Procureur General by the time you are forty, with\r\na chance of becoming a deputy. Please to observe, my dear boy, that our\r\nconscience will have been a little damaged in the process, and that we\r\nshall endure twenty years of drudgery and hidden poverty, and that\r\nour sisters are wearing Dian’s livery. I have the honor to call your\r\nattention to another fact: to wit, that there are but twenty Procureurs\r\nGeneraux at a time in all France, while there are some twenty thousand\r\nof you young men who aspire to that elevated position; that there are\r\nsome mountebanks among you who would sell their family to screw their\r\nfortunes a peg higher. If this sort of thing sickens you, try another\r\ncourse. The Baron de Rastignac thinks of becoming an advocate, does he?\r\nThere’s a nice prospect for you! Ten years of drudgery straight away.\r\nYou are obliged to live at the rate of a thousand francs a month; you\r\nmust have a library of law books, live in chambers, go into society, go\r\ndown on your knees to ask a solicitor for briefs, lick the dust off\r\nthe floor of the Palais de Justice. If this kind of business led to\r\nanything, I should not say no; but just give me the names of five\r\nadvocates here in Paris who by the time that they are fifty are making\r\nfifty thousand francs a year! Bah! I would sooner turn pirate on the\r\nhigh seas than have my soul shrivel up inside me like that. How will\r\nyou find the capital? There is but one way, marry a woman who has money.\r\nThere is no fun in it. Have you a mind to marry? You hang a stone around\r\nyour neck; for if you marry for money, what becomes of our exalted\r\nnotions of honor and so forth? You might as well fly in the face of\r\nsocial conventions at once. Is it nothing to crawl like a serpent before\r\nyour wife, to lick her mother’s feet, to descend to dirty actions\r\nthat would sicken swine--faugh!--never mind if you at least make your\r\nfortune. But you will be as doleful as a dripstone if you marry for\r\nmoney. It is better to wrestle with men than to wrangle at home with\r\nyour wife. You are at the crossway of the roads of life, my boy; choose\r\nyour way.\r\n\r\n[*] Travaux forces, forced labour.\r\n\r\n“But you have chosen already. You have gone to see your cousin of\r\nBeauseant, and you have had an inkling of luxury; you have been to Mme.\r\nde Restaud’s house, and in Father Goriot’s daughter you have seen a\r\nglimpse of the Parisienne for the first time. That day you came\r\nback with a word written on your forehead. I knew it, I could read\r\nit--‘_Success_!’ Yes, success at any price. ‘Bravo,’ said I to myself,\r\n‘here is the sort of fellow for me.’ You wanted money. Where was it all\r\nto come from? You have drained your sisters’ little hoard (all brothers\r\nsponge more or less on their sisters). Those fifteen hundred francs of\r\nyours (got together, God knows how! in a country where there are more\r\nchestnuts than five-franc pieces) will slip away like soldiers after\r\npillage. And, then, what will you do? Shall you begin to work? Work, or\r\nwhat you understand by work at this moment, means, for a man of Poiret’s\r\ncalibre, an old age in Mamma Vauquer’s lodging-house. There are fifty\r\nthousand young men in your position at this moment, all bent as you are\r\non solving one and the same problem--how to acquire a fortune rapidly.\r\nYou are but a unit in that aggregate. You can guess, therefore, what\r\nefforts you must make, how desperate the struggle is. There are not\r\nfifty thousand good positions for you; you must fight and devour one\r\nanother like spiders in a pot. Do you know how a man makes his way here?\r\nBy brilliant genius or by skilful corruption. You must either cut your\r\nway through these masses of men like a cannon ball, or steal among them\r\nlike a plague. Honesty is nothing to the purpose. Men bow before the\r\npower of genius; they hate it, and try to slander it, because genius\r\ndoes not divide the spoil; but if genius persists, they bow before it.\r\nTo sum it all up in a phrase, if they fail to smother genius in the mud,\r\nthey fall on their knees and worship it. Corruption is a great power\r\nin the world, and talent is scarce. So corruption is the weapon of\r\nsuperfluous mediocrity; you will be made to feel the point of it\r\neverywhere. You will see women who spend more than ten thousand francs\r\na year on dress, while their husband’s salary (his whole income) is\r\nsix thousand francs. You will see officials buying estates on twelve\r\nthousand francs a year. You will see women who sell themselves body and\r\nsoul to drive in a carriage belonging to the son of a peer of France,\r\nwho has a right to drive in the middle rank at Longchamp. You have\r\nseen that poor simpleton of a Goriot obliged to meet a bill with his\r\ndaughter’s name at the back of it, though her husband has fifty thousand\r\nfrancs a year. I defy you to walk a couple of yards anywhere in Paris\r\nwithout stumbling on some infernal complication. I’ll bet my head to\r\na head of that salad that you will stir up a hornet’s nest by taking a\r\nfancy to the first young, rich, and pretty woman you meet. They are all\r\ndodging the law, all at loggerheads with their husbands. If I were to\r\nbegin to tell you all that vanity or necessity (virtue is not often\r\nmixed up in it, you may be sure), all that vanity and necessity drive\r\nthem to do for lovers, finery, housekeeping, or children, I should never\r\ncome to an end. So an honest man is the common enemy.\r\n\r\n“But do you know what an honest man is? Here, in Paris, an honest man is\r\nthe man who keeps his own counsel, and will not divide the plunder. I am\r\nnot speaking now of those poor bond-slaves who do the work of the world\r\nwithout a reward for their toil--God Almighty’s outcasts, I call them.\r\nAmong them, I grant you, is virtue in all the flower of its stupidity,\r\nbut poverty is no less their portion. At this moment, I think I see the\r\nlong faces those good folk would pull if God played a practical joke on\r\nthem and stayed away at the Last Judgment.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, if you mean to make a fortune quickly, you must either be\r\nrich to begin with, or make people believe that you are rich. It is no\r\nuse playing here except for high stakes; once take to low play, it is\r\nall up with you. If in the scores of professions that are open to you,\r\nthere are ten men who rise very rapidly, people are sure to call them\r\nthieves. You can draw your own conclusions. Such is life. It is no\r\ncleaner than a kitchen; it reeks like a kitchen; and if you mean to\r\ncook your dinner, you must expect to soil your hands; the real art is\r\nin getting them clean again, and therein lies the whole morality of our\r\nepoch. If I take this tone in speaking of the world to you, I have the\r\nright to do so; I know it well. Do you think that I am blaming it? Far\r\nfrom it; the world has always been as it is now. Moralists’ strictures\r\nwill never change it. Mankind are not perfect, but one age is more\r\nor less hypocritical than another, and then simpletons say that its\r\nmorality is high or low. I do not think that the rich are any worse than\r\nthe poor; man is much the same, high or low, or wherever he is. In a\r\nmillion of these human cattle there may be half a score of bold spirits\r\nwho rise above the rest, above the laws; I am one of them. And you, if\r\nyou are cleverer than your fellows, make straight to your end, and hold\r\nyour head high. But you must lay your account with envy and slander and\r\nmediocrity, and every man’s hand will be against you. Napoleon met with\r\na Minister of War, Aubry by name, who all but sent him to the colonies.\r\n\r\n“Feel your pulse. Think whether you can get up morning after morning,\r\nstrengthened in yesterday’s purpose. In that case I will make you an\r\noffer that no one would decline. Listen attentively. You see, I have an\r\nidea of my own. My idea is to live a patriarchal life on a vast estate,\r\nsay a hundred thousand acres, somewhere in the Southern States of\r\nAmerica. I mean to be a planter, to have slaves, to make a few snug\r\nmillions by selling my cattle, timber, and tobacco; I want to live an\r\nabsolute monarch, and to do just as I please; to lead such a life as no\r\none here in these squalid dens of lath and plaster ever imagines. I am a\r\ngreat poet; I do not write my poems, I feel them, and act them. At this\r\nmoment I have fifty thousand francs, which might possibly buy forty\r\nnegroes. I want two hundred thousand francs, because I want to have\r\ntwo hundred negroes to carry out my notions of the patriarachal life\r\nproperly. Negroes, you see, are like a sort of family ready grown, and\r\nthere are no inquisitive public prosecutors out there to interfere with\r\nyou. That investment in ebony ought to mean three or four million francs\r\nin ten years’ time. If I am successful, no one will ask me who I am. I\r\nshall be Mr. Four Millions, an American citizen. I shall be fifty years\r\nold by then, and sound and hearty still; I shall enjoy life after my own\r\nfashion. In two words, if I find you an heiress with a million, will you\r\ngive me two hundred thousand francs? Twenty per cent commission, eh? Is\r\nthat too much? Your little wife will be very much in love with you. Once\r\nmarried, you will show signs of uneasiness and remorse; for a couple of\r\nweeks you will be depressed. Then, some night after sundry grimacings,\r\ncomes the confession, between two kisses, ‘Two hundred thousand francs\r\nof debts, my darling!’ This sort of farce is played every day in Paris,\r\nand by young men of the highest fashion. When a young wife has given her\r\nheart, she will not refuse her purse. Perhaps you are thinking that\r\nyou will lose the money for good? Not you. You will make two hundred\r\nthousand francs again by some stroke of business. With your capital and\r\nyour brains you should be able to accumulate as large a fortune as you\r\ncould wish. _Ergo_, in six months you will have made your own fortune,\r\nand our old friend Vautrin’s, and made an amiable woman very happy, to\r\nsay nothing of your people at home, who must blow on their fingers\r\nto warm them, in the winter, for lack of firewood. You need not be\r\nsurprised at my proposal, nor at the demand I make. Forty-seven out\r\nof every sixty great matches here in Paris are made after just such a\r\nbargain as this. The Chamber of Notaries compels my gentleman to----”\r\n\r\n“What must I do?” said Rastignac, eagerly interrupting Vautrin’s speech.\r\n\r\n“Next to nothing,” returned the other, with a slight involuntary\r\nmovement, the suppressed exultation of the angler when he feels a bite\r\nat the end of his line. “Follow me carefully! The heart of a girl whose\r\nlife is wretched and unhappy is a sponge that will thirstily absorb\r\nlove; a dry sponge that swells at the first drop of sentiment. If you\r\npay court to a young girl whose existence is a compound of loneliness,\r\ndespair, and poverty, and who has no suspicion that she will come into\r\na fortune, good Lord! it is quint and quatorze at piquet; it is knowing\r\nthe numbers of the lottery before-hand; it is speculating in the funds\r\nwhen you have news from a sure source; it is building up a marriage on\r\nan indestructible foundation. The girl may come in for millions, and she\r\nwill fling them, as if they were so many pebbles, at your feet. ‘Take\r\nit, my beloved! Take it, Alfred, Adolphe, Eugene!’ or whoever it\r\nwas that showed his sense by sacrificing himself for her. And as for\r\nsacrificing himself, this is how I understand it. You sell a coat that\r\nis getting shabby, so that you can take her to the _Cadran bleu_, treat\r\nher to mushrooms on toast, and then go to the Ambigu-Comique in the\r\nevening; you pawn your watch to buy her a shawl. I need not remind you\r\nof the fiddle-faddle sentimentality that goes down so well with all\r\nwomen; you spill a few drops of water on your stationery, for instance;\r\nthose are the tears you shed while far away from her. You look to me as\r\nif you were perfectly acquainted with the argot of the heart. Paris, you\r\nsee, is like a forest in the New World, where you have to deal with\r\na score of varieties of savages--Illinois and Hurons, who live on the\r\nproceed of their social hunting. You are a hunter of millions; you set\r\nyour snares; you use lures and nets; there are many ways of hunting.\r\nSome hunt heiresses, others a legacy; some fish for souls, yet others\r\nsell their clients, bound hand and foot. Every one who comes back from\r\nthe chase with his game-bag well filled meets with a warm welcome in\r\ngood society. In justice to this hospitable part of the world, it must\r\nbe said that you have to do with the most easy and good-natured of\r\ngreat cities. If the proud aristocracies of the rest of Europe refuse\r\nadmittance among their ranks to a disreputable millionaire, Paris\r\nstretches out a hand to him, goes to his banquets, eats his dinners, and\r\nhobnobs with his infamy.”\r\n\r\n“But where is such a girl to be found?” asked Eugene.\r\n\r\n“Under your eyes; she is yours already.”\r\n\r\n“Mlle. Victorine?”\r\n\r\n“Precisely.”\r\n\r\n“And what was that you said?”\r\n\r\n“She is in love with you already, your little Baronne de Rastignac!”\r\n\r\n“She has not a penny,” Eugene continued, much mystified.\r\n\r\n“Ah! now we are coming to it! Just another word or two, and it will all\r\nbe clear enough. Her father, Taillefer, is an old scoundrel; it is said\r\nthat he murdered one of his friends at the time of the Revolution. He is\r\none of your comedians that sets up to have opinions of his own. He is a\r\nbanker--senior partner in the house of Frederic Taillefer and Company.\r\nHe has one son, and means to leave all he has to the boy, to the\r\nprejudice of Victorine. For my part, I don’t like to see injustice of\r\nthis sort. I am like Don Quixote, I have a fancy for defending the weak\r\nagainst the strong. If it should please God to take that youth away from\r\nhim, Taillefer would have only his daughter left; he would want to leave\r\nhis money to some one or other; an absurd notion, but it is only human\r\nnature, and he is not likely to have any more children, as I know.\r\nVictorine is gentle and amiable; she will soon twist her father round\r\nher fingers, and set his head spinning like a German top by plying him\r\nwith sentiment! She will be too much touched by your devotion to\r\nforget you; you will marry her. I mean to play Providence for you,\r\nand Providence is to do my will. I have a friend whom I have attached\r\nclosely to myself, a colonel in the Army of the Loire, who has just been\r\ntransferred into the _garde royale_. He has taken my advice and turned\r\nultra-royalist; he is not one of those fools who never change their\r\nopinions. Of all pieces of advice, my cherub, I would give you\r\nthis--don’t stick to your opinions any more than to your words. If any\r\none asks you for them, let him have them--at a price. A man who prides\r\nhimself on going in a straight line through life is an idiot who\r\nbelieves in infallibility. There are no such things as principles; there\r\nare only events, and there are no laws but those of expediency: a man of\r\ntalent accepts events and the circumstances in which he finds himself,\r\nand turns everything to his own ends. If laws and principles were fixed\r\nand invariable, nations would not change them as readily as we change\r\nour shirts. The individual is not obliged to be more particular than the\r\nnation. A man whose services to France have been of the very slightest\r\nis a fetich looked on with superstitious awe because he has always\r\nseen everything in red; but he is good, at the most, to be put into the\r\nMuseum of Arts and Crafts, among the automatic machines, and labeled La\r\nFayette; while the prince at whom everybody flings a stone, the man who\r\ndespises humanity so much that he spits as many oaths as he is asked for\r\nin the face of humanity, saved France from being torn in pieces at the\r\nCongress of Vienna; and they who should have given him laurels fling\r\nmud at him. Oh! I know something of affairs, I can tell you; I have the\r\nsecrets of many men! Enough. When I find three minds in agreement as\r\nto the application of a principle, I shall have a fixed and immovable\r\nopinion--I shall have to wait a long while first. In the Tribunals you\r\nwill not find three judges of the same opinion on a single point of law.\r\nTo return to the man I was telling you of. He would crucify Jesus Christ\r\nagain, if I bade him. At a word from his old chum Vautrin he will pick\r\na quarrel with a scamp that will not send so much as five francs to his\r\nsister, poor girl, and” (here Vautrin rose to his feet and stood like a\r\nfencing-master about to lunge)--“turn him off into the dark!” he added.\r\n\r\n“How frightful!” said Eugene. “You do not really mean it? M. Vautrin,\r\nyou are joking!”\r\n\r\n“There! there! Keep cool!” said the other. “Don’t behave like a baby.\r\nBut if you find any amusement in it, be indignant, flare up! Say that\r\nI am a scoundrel, a rascal, a rogue, a bandit; but do not call me a\r\nblackleg nor a spy! There, out with it, fire away! I forgive you; it is\r\nquite natural at your age. I was like that myself once. Only remember\r\nthis, you will do worse things yourself some day. You will flirt with\r\nsome pretty woman and take her money. You have thought of that, of\r\ncourse,” said Vautrin, “for how are you to succeed unless love is laid\r\nunder contribution? There are no two ways about virtue, my dear student;\r\nit either is, or it is not. Talk of doing penance for your sins! It is\r\na nice system of business, when you pay for your crime by an act of\r\ncontrition! You seduce a woman that you may set your foot on such and\r\nsuch a rung of the social ladder; you sow dissension among the children\r\nof a family; you descend, in short, to every base action that can be\r\ncommitted at home or abroad, to gain your own ends for your own pleasure\r\nor your profit; and can you imagine that these are acts of faith, hope,\r\nor charity? How is it that a dandy, who in a night has robbed a boy of\r\nhalf his fortune, gets only a couple of months in prison; while a poor\r\ndevil who steals a banknote for a thousand francs, with aggravating\r\ncircumstances, is condemned to penal servitude? Those are your laws. Not\r\na single provision but lands you in some absurdity. That man with yellow\r\ngloves and a golden tongue commits many a murder; he sheds no blood, but\r\nhe drains his victim’s veins as surely; a desperado forces open a door\r\nwith a crowbar, dark deeds both of them! You yourself will do every one\r\nof those things that I suggest to you to-day, bar the bloodshed. Do\r\nyou believe that there is any absolute standard in this world? Despise\r\nmankind and find out the meshes that you can slip through in the net of\r\nthe Code. The secret of a great success for which you are at a loss\r\nto account is a crime that has never been found out, because it was\r\nproperly executed.”\r\n\r\n“Silence, sir! I will not hear any more; you make me doubt myself. At\r\nthis moment my sentiments are all my science.”\r\n\r\n“Just as you please, my fine fellow; I did think you were so\r\nweak-minded,” said Vautrin, “I shall say no more about it. One last\r\nword, however,” and he looked hard at the student--“you have my secret,”\r\n he said.\r\n\r\n“A young man who refuses your offer knows that he must forget it.”\r\n\r\n“Quite right, quite right; I am glad to hear you say so. Somebody else\r\nmight not be so scrupulous, you see. Keep in mind what I want to do for\r\nyou. I will give you a fortnight. The offer is still open.”\r\n\r\n“What a head of iron the man has!” said Eugene to himself, as he watched\r\nVautrin walk unconcernedly away with his cane under his arm. “Yet Mme.\r\nde Beauseant said as much more gracefully; he has only stated the case\r\nin cruder language. He would tear my heart with claws of steel. What\r\nmade me think of going to Mme. de Nucingen? He guessed my motives before\r\nI knew them myself. To sum it up, that outlaw has told me more about\r\nvirtue than all I have learned from men and books. If virtue admits of\r\nno compromises, I have certainly robbed my sisters,” he said, throwing\r\ndown the bags on the table.\r\n\r\nHe sat down again and fell, unconscious of his surroundings, into deep\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n“To be faithful to an ideal of virtue! A heroic martyrdom! Pshaw! every\r\none believes in virtue, but who is virtuous? Nations have made an idol\r\nof Liberty, but what nation on the face of the earth is free? My youth\r\nis still like a blue and cloudless sky. If I set myself to obtain wealth\r\nor power, does it mean that I must make up my mind to lie, and fawn, and\r\ncringe, and swagger, and flatter, and dissemble? To consent to be the\r\nservant of others who have likewise fawned, and lied, and flattered?\r\nMust I cringe to them before I can hope to be their accomplice? Well,\r\nthen, I decline. I mean to work nobly and with a single heart. I\r\nwill work day and night; I will owe my fortune to nothing but my own\r\nexertions. It may be the slowest of all roads to success, but I shall\r\nlay my head on the pillow at night untroubled by evil thoughts. Is there\r\na greater thing than this--to look back over your life and know that\r\nit is stainless as a lily? I and my life are like a young man and his\r\nbetrothed. Vautrin has put before me all that comes after ten years of\r\nmarriage. The devil! my head is swimming. I do not want to think at all;\r\nthe heart is a sure guide.”\r\n\r\nEugene was roused from his musings by the voice of the stout Sylvie,\r\nwho announced that the tailor had come, and Eugene therefore made his\r\nappearance before the man with the two money bags, and was not ill\r\npleased that it should be so. When he had tried on his dress suit, he\r\nput on his new morning costume, which completely metamorphosed him.\r\n\r\n“I am quite equal to M. de Trailles,” he said to himself. “In short, I\r\nlook like a gentleman.”\r\n\r\n“You asked me, sir, if I knew the houses where Mme. de Nucingen goes,”\r\n Father Goriot’s voice spoke from the doorway of Eugene’s room.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Very well then, she is going to the Marechale Carigliano’s ball on\r\nMonday. If you can manage to be there, I shall hear from you whether my\r\ntwo girls enjoyed themselves, and how they were dressed, and all about\r\nit in fact.”\r\n\r\n“How did you find that out, my good Goriot?” said Eugene, putting a\r\nchair by the fire for his visitor.\r\n\r\n“Her maid told me. I hear all about their doings from Therese and\r\nConstance,” he added gleefully.\r\n\r\nThe old man looked like a lover who is still young enough to be made\r\nhappy by the discovery of some little stratagem which brings him\r\ninformation of his lady-love without her knowledge.\r\n\r\n“_You_ will see them both!” he said, giving artless expression to a pang\r\nof jealousy.\r\n\r\n“I do not know,” answered Eugene. “I will go to Mme. de Beauseant and\r\nask her for an introduction to the Marechale.”\r\n\r\nEugene felt a thrill of pleasure at the thought of appearing before the\r\nVicomtesse, dressed as henceforward he always meant to be. The “abysses\r\nof the human heart,” in the moralists’ phrase, are only insidious\r\nthoughts, involuntary promptings of personal interest. The instinct of\r\nenjoyment turns the scale; those rapid changes of purpose which have\r\nfurnished the text for so much rhetoric are calculations prompted by\r\nthe hope of pleasure. Rastignac beholding himself well dressed and\r\nimpeccable as to gloves and boots, forgot his virtuous resolutions.\r\nYouth, moreover, when bent upon wrongdoing does not dare to behold\r\nhimself in the mirror of consciousness; mature age has seen itself; and\r\ntherein lies the whole difference between these two phases of life.\r\n\r\nA friendship between Eugene and his neighbor, Father Goriot, had\r\nbeen growing up for several days past. This secret friendship and the\r\nantipathy that the student had begun to entertain for Vautrin arose\r\nfrom the same psychological causes. The bold philosopher who shall\r\ninvestigate the effects of mental action upon the physical world\r\nwill doubtless find more than one proof of the material nature of our\r\nsentiments in other animals. What physiognomist is as quick to discern\r\ncharacter as a dog is to discover from a stranger’s face whether this\r\nis a friend or no? Those by-words--“atoms,” “affinities”--are facts\r\nsurviving in modern languages for the confusion of philosophic wiseacres\r\nwho amuse themselves by winnowing the chaff of language to find its\r\ngrammatical roots. We _feel_ that we are loved. Our sentiments make\r\nthemselves felt in everything, even at a great distance. A letter is\r\na living soul, and so faithful an echo of the voice that speaks in it,\r\nthat finer natures look upon a letter as one of love’s most precious\r\ntreasures. Father Goriot’s affection was of the instinctive order, a\r\ncanine affection raised to a sublime pitch; he had scented compassion in\r\nthe air, and the kindly respect and youthful sympathy in the student’s\r\nheart. This friendship had, however, scarcely reached the stage at which\r\nconfidences are made. Though Eugene had spoken of his wish to meet Mme.\r\nde Nucingen, it was not because he counted on the old man to introduce\r\nhim to her house, for he hoped that his own audacity might stand him in\r\ngood stead. All that Father Goriot had said as yet about his daughters\r\nhad referred to the remarks that the student had made so freely in\r\npublic on that day of the two visits.\r\n\r\n“How could you think that Mme. de Restaud bore you a grudge for\r\nmentioning my name?” he had said on the day following that scene at\r\ndinner. “My daughters are very fond of me; I am a happy father; but\r\nmy sons-in-law have behaved badly to me, and rather than make trouble\r\nbetween my darlings and their husbands, I choose to see my daughters\r\nsecretly. Fathers who can see their daughters at any time have no idea\r\nof all the pleasure that all this mystery gives me; I cannot always see\r\nmine when I wish, do you understand? So when it is fine I walk out in\r\nthe Champs-Elysees, after finding out from their waiting-maids whether\r\nmy daughters mean to go out. I wait near the entrance; my heart beats\r\nfast when the carriages begin to come; I admire them in their dresses,\r\nand as they pass they give me a little smile, and it seems as if\r\neverything was lighted up for me by a ray of bright sunlight. I wait,\r\nfor they always go back the same way, and then I see them again; the\r\nfresh air has done them good and brought color into their cheeks; all\r\nabout me people say, ‘What a beautiful woman that is!’ and it does my\r\nheart good to hear them.\r\n\r\n“Are they not my own flesh and blood? I love the very horses that draw\r\nthem; I envy the little lap-dog on their knees. Their happiness is my\r\nlife. Every one loves after his own fashion, and mine does no one any\r\nharm; why should people trouble their heads about me? I am happy in my\r\nown way. Is there any law against going to see my girls in the evening\r\nwhen they are going out to a ball? And what a disappointment it is when\r\nI get there too late, and am told that ‘Madame has gone out!’ Once I\r\nwaited till three o’clock in the morning for Nasie; I had not seen her\r\nfor two whole days. I was so pleased, that it was almost too much for\r\nme! Please do not speak of me unless it is to say how good my daughters\r\nare to me. They are always wanting to heap presents upon me, but I will\r\nnot have it. ‘Just keep your money,’ I tell them. ‘What should I do\r\nwith it? I want nothing.’ And what am I, sir, after all? An old carcase,\r\nwhose soul is always where my daughters are. When you have seen Mme.\r\nde Nucingen, tell me which you like the most,” said the old man after a\r\nmoment’s pause, while Eugene put the last touches to his toilette. The\r\nstudent was about to go out to walk in the Garden of the Tuileries\r\nuntil the hour when he could venture to appear in Mme. de Beauseant’s\r\ndrawing-room.\r\n\r\nThat walk was a turning-point in Eugene’s career. Several women noticed\r\nhim; he looked so handsome, so young, and so well dressed. This almost\r\nadmiring attention gave a new turn to his thoughts. He forgot his\r\nsisters and the aunt who had robbed herself for him; he no longer\r\nremembered his own virtuous scruples. He had seen hovering above his\r\nhead the fiend so easy to mistake for an angel, the Devil with rainbow\r\nwings, who scatters rubies, and aims his golden shafts at palace fronts,\r\nwho invests women with purple, and thrones with a glory that dazzles the\r\neyes of fools till they forget the simple origins of royal dominion; he\r\nhad heard the rustle of that Vanity whose tinsel seems to us to be the\r\nsymbol of power. However cynical Vautrin’s words had been, they had made\r\nan impression on his mind, as the sordid features of the old crone who\r\nwhispers, “A lover, and gold in torrents,” remain engraven on a young\r\ngirl’s memory.\r\n\r\nEugene lounged about the walks till it was nearly five o’clock, then\r\nhe went to Mme. de Beauseant, and received one of the terrible blows\r\nagainst which young hearts are defenceless. Hitherto the Vicomtesse had\r\nreceived him with the kindly urbanity, the bland grace of manner that is\r\nthe result of fine breeding, but is only complete when it comes from the\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nTo-day Mme. de Beauseant bowed constrainedly, and spoke curtly:\r\n\r\n“M. de Rastignac, I cannot possibly see you, at least not at this\r\nmoment. I am engaged...”\r\n\r\nAn observer, and Rastignac instantly became an observer, could read the\r\nwhole history, the character and customs of caste, in the phrase, in the\r\ntones of her voice, in her glance and bearing. He caught a glimpse of\r\nthe iron hand beneath the velvet glove--the personality, the egoism\r\nbeneath the manner, the wood beneath the varnish. In short, he heard\r\nthat unmistakable I THE KING that issues from the plumed canopy of\r\nthe throne, and finds its last echo under the crest of the simplest\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\nEugene had trusted too implicitly to the generosity of a woman; he\r\ncould not believe in her haughtiness. Like all the unfortunate, he had\r\nsubscribed, in all good faith, the generous compact which should bind\r\nthe benefactor to the recipient, and the first article in that bond,\r\nbetween two large-hearted natures, is a perfect equality. The kindness\r\nwhich knits two souls together is as rare, as divine, and as little\r\nunderstood as the passion of love, for both love and kindness are the\r\nlavish generosity of noble natures. Rastignac was set upon going to the\r\nDuchesse de Carigliano’s ball, so he swallowed down this rebuff.\r\n\r\n“Madame,” he faltered out, “I would not have come to trouble you about\r\na trifling matter; be so kind as to permit me to see you later, I can\r\nwait.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, come and dine with me,” she said, a little confused by\r\nthe harsh way in which she had spoken, for this lady was as genuinely\r\nkind-hearted as she was high-born.\r\n\r\nEugene was touched by this sudden relenting, but none the less he said\r\nto himself as he went away, “Crawl in the dust, put up with every kind\r\nof treatment. What must the rest of the world be like when one of the\r\nkindest of women forgets all her promises of befriending me in a moment,\r\nand tosses me aside like an old shoe? So it is every one for himself? It\r\nis true that her house is not a shop, and I have put myself in the wrong\r\nby needing her help. You should cut your way through the world like a\r\ncannon ball, as Vautrin said.”\r\n\r\nBut the student’s bitter thoughts were soon dissipated by the pleasure\r\nwhich he promised himself in this dinner with the Vicomtesse. Fate\r\nseemed to determine that the smallest accidents in his life should\r\ncombine to urge him into a career, which the terrible sphinx of the\r\nMaison Vauquer had described as a field of battle where you must either\r\nslay or be slain, and cheat to avoid being cheated. You leave your\r\nconscience and your heart at the barriers, and wear a mask on entering\r\ninto this game of grim earnest, where, as in ancient Sparta, you must\r\nsnatch your prize without being detected if you would deserve the crown.\r\n\r\nOn his return he found the Vicomtesse gracious and kindly, as she had\r\nalways been to him. They went together to the dining-room, where the\r\nVicomte was waiting for his wife. In the time of the Restoration the\r\nluxury of the table was carried, as is well known, to the highest\r\ndegree, and M. de Beauseant, like many jaded men of the world, had few\r\npleasures left but those of good cheer; in this matter, in fact, he was\r\na gourmand of the schools of Louis XVIII. and of the Duc d’Escars, and\r\nluxury was supplemented by splendor. Eugene, dining for the first time\r\nin a house where the traditions of grandeur had descended through many\r\ngenerations, had never seen any spectacle like this that now met his\r\neyes. In the time of the Empire, balls had always ended with a supper,\r\nbecause the officers who took part in them must be fortified for\r\nimmediate service, and even in Paris might be called upon to leave the\r\nballroom for the battlefield. This arrangement had gone out of fashion\r\nunder the Monarchy, and Eugene had so far only been asked to dances.\r\nThe self-possession which pre-eminently distinguished him in later life\r\nalready stood him in good stead, and he did not betray his amazement.\r\nYet as he saw for the first time the finely wrought silver plate, the\r\ncompleteness of every detail, the sumptuous dinner, noiselessly served,\r\nit was difficult for such an ardent imagination not to prefer this life\r\nof studied and refined luxury to the hardships of the life which he had\r\nchosen only that morning.\r\n\r\nHis thoughts went back for a moment to the lodging-house, and with a\r\nfeeling of profound loathing, he vowed to himself that at New Year he\r\nwould go; prompted at least as much by a desire to live among cleaner\r\nsurroundings as by a wish to shake off Vautrin, whose huge hand he\r\nseemed to feel on his shoulder at that moment. When you consider the\r\nnumberless forms, clamorous or mute, that corruption takes in Paris,\r\ncommon-sense begins to wonder what mental aberration prompted the State\r\nto establish great colleges and schools there, and assemble young men in\r\nthe capital; how it is that pretty women are respected, or that the gold\r\ncoin displayed in the money-changer’s wooden saucers does not take to\r\nitself wings in the twinkling of an eye; and when you come to think\r\nfurther, how comparatively few cases of crime there are, and to count\r\nup the misdemeanors committed by youth, is there not a certain amount of\r\nrespect due to these patient Tantaluses who wrestle with themselves and\r\nnearly always come off victorious? The struggles of the poor student\r\nin Paris, if skilfully drawn, would furnish a most dramatic picture of\r\nmodern civilization.\r\n\r\nIn vain Mme. de Beauseant looked at Eugene as if asking him to speak;\r\nthe student was tongue-tied in the Vicomte’s presence.\r\n\r\n“Are you going to take me to the Italiens this evening?” the Vicomtesse\r\nasked her husband.\r\n\r\n“You cannot doubt that I should obey you with pleasure,” he answered,\r\nand there was a sarcastic tinge in his politeness which Eugene did not\r\ndetect, “but I ought to go to meet some one at the Varietes.”\r\n\r\n“His mistress,” said she to herself.\r\n\r\n“Then, is not Ajuda coming for you this evening?” inquired the Vicomte.\r\n\r\n“No,” she answered, petulantly.\r\n\r\n“Very well, then, if you really must have an arm, take that of M. de\r\nRastignac.”\r\n\r\nThe Vicomtess turned to Eugene with a smile.\r\n\r\n“That would be a very compromising step for you,” she said.\r\n\r\n“‘A Frenchman loves danger, because in danger there is glory,’ to quote\r\nM. de Chateaubriand,” said Rastignac, with a bow.\r\n\r\nA few moments later he was sitting beside Mme. de Beauseant in\r\na brougham, that whirled them through the streets of Paris to a\r\nfashionable theatre. It seemed to him that some fairy magic had suddenly\r\ntransported him into a box facing the stage. All the lorgnettes of the\r\nhouse were pointed at him as he entered, and at the Vicomtesse in her\r\ncharming toilette. He went from enchantment to enchantment.\r\n\r\n“You must talk to me, you know,” said Mme. de Beauseant. “Ah! look!\r\nThere is Mme. de Nucingen in the third box from ours. Her sister and M.\r\nde Trailles are on the other side.”\r\n\r\nThe Vicomtesse glanced as she spoke at the box where Mlle. de Rochefide\r\nshould have been; M. d’Ajuda was not there, and Mme. de Beauseant’s face\r\nlighted up in a marvelous way.\r\n\r\n“She is charming,” said Eugene, after looking at Mme. de Nucingen.\r\n\r\n“She has white eyelashes.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but she has such a pretty slender figure!”\r\n\r\n“Her hands are large.”\r\n\r\n“Such beautiful eyes!”\r\n\r\n“Her face is long.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but length gives distinction.”\r\n\r\n“It is lucky for her that she has some distinction in her face. Just see\r\nhow she fidgets with her opera-glass! The Goriot blood shows itself in\r\nevery movement,” said the Vicomtesse, much to Eugene’s astonishment.\r\n\r\nIndeed, Mme. de Beauseant seemed to be engaged in making a survey of\r\nthe house, and to be unconscious of Mme. Nucingen’s existence; but no\r\nmovement made by the latter was lost upon the Vicomtesse. The house was\r\nfull of the loveliest women in Paris, so that Delphine de Nucingen was\r\nnot a little flattered to receive the undivided attention of Mme. de\r\nBeauseant’s young, handsome, and well-dressed cousin, who seemed to have\r\nno eyes for any one else.\r\n\r\n“If you look at her so persistently, you will make people talk, M. de\r\nRastignac. You will never succeed if you fling yourself at any one’s\r\nhead like that.”\r\n\r\n“My dear cousin,” said Eugene, “you have protected me indeed so far,\r\nand now if you would complete your work, I only ask of you a favor which\r\nwill cost you but little, and be of very great service to me. I have\r\nlost my heart.”\r\n\r\n“Already!”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And to that woman!”\r\n\r\n“How could I aspire to find any one else to listen to me?” he asked,\r\nwith a keen glance at his cousin. “Her Grace the Duchesse de Carigliano\r\nis a friend of the Duchesse de Berri,” he went on, after a pause; “you\r\nare sure to see her, will you be so kind as to present me to her, and to\r\ntake me to her ball on Monday? I shall meet Mme. de Nucingen there, and\r\nenter into my first skirmish.”\r\n\r\n“Willingly,” she said. “If you have a liking for her already, your\r\naffairs of the heart are like to prosper. That is de Marsay over there\r\nin the Princesse Galathionne’s box. Mme. de Nucingen is racked with\r\njealousy. There is no better time for approaching a woman, especially\r\nif she happens to be a banker’s wife. All those ladies of the\r\nChaussee-d’Antin love revenge.”\r\n\r\n“Then, what would you do yourself in such a case?”\r\n\r\n“I should suffer in silence.”\r\n\r\nAt this point the Marquis d’Ajuda appeared in Mme. de Beauseant’s box.\r\n\r\n“I have made a muddle of my affairs to come to you,” he said, “and I am\r\ntelling you about it, so that it may not be a sacrifice.”\r\n\r\nEugene saw the glow of joy on the Vicomtesse’s face, and knew that this\r\nwas love, and learned the difference between love and the affectations\r\nof Parisian coquetry. He admired his cousin, grew mute, and yielded his\r\nplace to M. d’Ajuda with a sigh.\r\n\r\n“How noble, how sublime a woman is when she loves like that!” he said to\r\nhimself. “And _he_ could forsake her for a doll! Oh! how could any one\r\nforsake her?”\r\n\r\nThere was a boy’s passionate indignation in his heart. He could have\r\nflung himself at Mme. de Beauseant’s feet; he longed for the power of\r\nthe devil if he could snatch her away and hide her in his heart, as an\r\neagle snatches up some white yearling from the plains and bears it to\r\nits eyrie. It was humiliating to him to think that in all this gallery\r\nof fair pictures he had not one picture of his own. “To have a mistress\r\nand an almost royal position is a sign of power,” he said to himself.\r\nAnd he looked at Mme. de Nucingen as a man measures another who has\r\ninsulted him.\r\n\r\nThe Vicomtesse turned to him, and the expression of her eyes thanked him\r\na thousand times for his discretion. The first act came to an end just\r\nthen.\r\n\r\n“Do you know Mme. de Nucingen well enough to present M. de Rastignac to\r\nher?” she asked of the Marquis d’Ajuda.\r\n\r\n“She will be delighted,” said the Marquis. The handsome Portuguese rose\r\nas he spoke and took the student’s arm, and in another moment Eugene\r\nfound himself in Mme. de Nucingen’s box.\r\n\r\n“Madame,” said the Marquis, “I have the honor of presenting to you the\r\nChevalier Eugene de Rastignac; he is a cousin of Mme. de Beauseant’s.\r\nYou have made so deep an impression upon him, that I thought I would\r\nfill up the measure of his happiness by bringing him nearer to his\r\ndivinity.”\r\n\r\nWords spoken half jestingly to cover their somewhat disrespectful\r\nimport; but such an implication, if carefully disguised, never gives\r\noffence to a woman. Mme. de Nucingen smiled, and offered Eugene the\r\nplace which her husband had just left.\r\n\r\n“I do not venture to suggest that you should stay with me, monsieur,”\r\n she said. “Those who are so fortunate as to be in Mme. de Beauseant’s\r\ncompany do not desire to leave it.”\r\n\r\n“Madame,” Eugene said, lowering his voice, “I think that to please my\r\ncousin I should remain with you. Before my lord Marquis came we were\r\nspeaking of you and of your exceedingly distinguished appearance,” he\r\nadded aloud.\r\n\r\nM. d’Ajuda turned and left them.\r\n\r\n“Are you really going to stay with me, monsieur?” asked the Baroness.\r\n“Then we shall make each other’s acquaintance. Mme. de Restaud told me\r\nabout you, and has made me anxious to meet you.”\r\n\r\n“She must be very insincere, then, for she has shut her door on me.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Madame, I will tell you honestly the reason why; but I must crave your\r\nindulgence before confiding such a secret to you. I am your father’s\r\nneighbor; I had no idea that Mme. de Restaud was his daughter. I was\r\nrash enough to mention his name; I meant no harm, but I annoyed your\r\nsister and her husband very much. You cannot think how severely the\r\nDuchesse de Langeais and my cousin blamed this apostasy on a daughter’s\r\npart, as a piece of bad taste. I told them all about it, and they both\r\nburst out laughing. Then Mme. de Beauseant made some comparison between\r\nyou and your sister, speaking in high terms of you, and saying how very\r\nfond you were of my neighbor, M. Goriot. And, indeed, how could you help\r\nloving him? He adores you so passionately that I am jealous already. We\r\ntalked about you this morning for two hours. So this evening I was quite\r\nfull of all that your father had told me, and while I was dining with my\r\ncousin I said that you could not be as beautiful as affectionate. Mme.\r\nde Beauseant meant to gratify such warm admiration, I think, when she\r\nbrought me here, telling me, in her gracious way, that I should see\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Then, even now, I owe you a debt of gratitude, monsieur,” said the\r\nbanker’s wife. “We shall be quite old friends in a little while.”\r\n\r\n“Although a friendship with you could not be like an ordinary\r\nfriendship,” said Rastignac; “I should never wish to be your friend.”\r\n\r\nSuch stereotyped phrases as these, in the mouths of beginners, possess\r\nan unfailing charm for women, and are insipid only when read coldly; for\r\na young man’s tone, glance and attitude give a surpassing eloquence to\r\nthe banal phrases. Mme. de Nucingen thought that Rastignac was adorable.\r\nThen, woman-like, being at a loss how to reply to the student’s\r\noutspoken admiration, she answered a previous remark.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is very wrong of my sister to treat our poor father as she\r\ndoes,” she said; “he has been a Providence to us. It was not until M. de\r\nNucingen positively ordered me only to receive him in the mornings that\r\nI yielded the point. But I have been unhappy about it for a long while;\r\nI have shed many tears over it. This violence to my feelings, with my\r\nhusband’s brutal treatment, have been two causes of my unhappy married\r\nlife. There is certainly no woman in Paris whose lot seems more enviable\r\nthan mine, and yet, in reality, there is not one so much to be pitied.\r\nYou will think I must be out of my senses to talk to you like this; but\r\nyou know my father, and I cannot regard you as a stranger.”\r\n\r\n“You will find no one,” said Eugene, “who longs as eagerly as I do to be\r\nyours. What do all women seek? Happiness.” (He answered his own question\r\nin low, vibrating tones.) “And if happiness for a woman means that she\r\nis to be loved and adored, to have a friend to whom she can pour out her\r\nwishes, her fancies, her sorrows and joys; to whom she can lay bare\r\nher heart and soul, and all her fair defects and her gracious virtues,\r\nwithout fear of a betrayal; believe me, the devotion and the warmth that\r\nnever fails can only be found in the heart of a young man who, at a bare\r\nsign from you, would go to his death, who neither knows nor cares to\r\nknow anything as yet of the world, because you will be all the world to\r\nhim. I myself, you see (you will laugh at my simplicity), have just come\r\nfrom a remote country district; I am quite new to this world of Paris; I\r\nhave only known true and loving hearts; and I made up my mind that here\r\nI should find no love. Then I chanced to meet my cousin, and to see\r\nmy cousin’s heart from very near; I have divined the inexhaustible\r\ntreasures of passion, and, like Cherubino, I am the lover of all women,\r\nuntil the day comes when I find _the_ woman to whom I may devote myself.\r\nAs soon as I saw you, as soon as I came into the theatre this evening, I\r\nfelt myself borne towards you as if by the current of a stream. I had so\r\noften thought of you already, but I had never dreamed that you would be\r\nso beautiful! Mme. de Beauseant told me that I must not look so much at\r\nyou. She does not know the charm of your red lips, your fair face, nor\r\nsee how soft your eyes are.... I also am beginning to talk nonsense; but\r\nlet me talk.”\r\n\r\nNothing pleases a woman better than to listen to such whispered words as\r\nthese; the most puritanical among them listens even when she ought not\r\nto reply to them; and Rastignac, having once begun, continued to pour\r\nout his story, dropping his voice, that she might lean and listen; and\r\nMme. de Nucingen, smiling, glanced from time to time at de Marsay, who\r\nstill sat in the Princesse Galathionne’s box.\r\n\r\nRastignac did not leave Mme. de Nucingen till her husband came to take\r\nher home.\r\n\r\n“Madame,” Eugene said, “I shall have the pleasure of calling upon you\r\nbefore the Duchesse de Carigliano’s ball.”\r\n\r\n“If Matame infites you to come,” said the Baron, a thickset Alsatian,\r\nwith indications of a sinister cunning in his full-moon countenance,\r\n“you are quide sure of being well receifed.”\r\n\r\n“My affairs seem to be in a promising way,” said Eugene to himself.--\r\n“‘Can you love me?’ I asked her, and she did not resent it. “The bit is in\r\nthe horse’s mouth, and I have only to mount and ride;” and with that\r\nhe went to pay his respects to Mme. de Beauseant, who was leaving the\r\ntheatre on d’Ajuda’s arm.\r\n\r\nThe student did not know that the Baroness’ thoughts had been wandering;\r\nthat she was even then expecting a letter from de Marsay, one of those\r\nletters that bring about a rupture that rends the soul; so, happy in his\r\ndelusion, Eugene went with the Vicomtesse to the peristyle, where people\r\nwere waiting till their carriages were announced.\r\n\r\n“That cousin of yours is hardly recognizable for the same man,” said the\r\nPortuguese laughingly to the Vicomtesse, when Eugene had taken leave of\r\nthem. “He will break the bank. He is as supple as an eel; he will go a\r\nlong way, of that I am sure. Who else could have picked out a woman for\r\nhim, as you did, just when she needed consolation?”\r\n\r\n“But it is not certain that she does not still love the faithless\r\nlover,” said Mme. de Beauseant.\r\n\r\nThe student meanwhile walked back from the Theatre-Italien to the Rue\r\nNeuve-Sainte-Genevieve, making the most delightful plans as he went. He\r\nhad noticed how closely Mme. de Restaud had scrutinized him when he sat\r\nbeside Mme. de Nucingen, and inferred that the Countess’ doors would not\r\nbe closed in the future. Four important houses were now open to him--for\r\nhe meant to stand well with the Marechale; he had four supporters in the\r\ninmost circle of society in Paris. Even now it was clear to him that,\r\nonce involved in this intricate social machinery, he must attach himself\r\nto a spoke of the wheel that was to turn and raise his fortunes; he\r\nwould not examine himself too curiously as to the methods, but he was\r\ncertain of the end, and conscious of the power to gain and keep his\r\nhold.\r\n\r\n“If Mme. de Nucingen takes an interest in me, I will teach her how to\r\nmanage her husband. That husband of hers is a great speculator; he might\r\nput me in the way of making a fortune by a single stroke.”\r\n\r\nHe did not say this bluntly in so many words; as yet, indeed, he was\r\nnot sufficient of a diplomatist to sum up a situation, to see its\r\npossibilities at a glance, and calculate the chances in his favor. These\r\nwere nothing but hazy ideas that floated over his mental horizon; they\r\nwere less cynical than Vautrin’s notions; but if they had been tried in\r\nthe crucible of conscience, no very pure result would have issued from\r\nthe test. It is by a succession of such like transactions that men sink\r\nat last to the level of the relaxed morality of this epoch, when there\r\nhave never been so few of those who square their courses with their\r\ntheories, so few of those noble characters who do not yield to\r\ntemptation, for whom the slightest deviation from the line of rectitude\r\nis a crime. To these magnificent types of uncompromising Right we owe\r\ntwo masterpieces--the Alceste of Moliere, and, in our own day, the\r\ncharacters of Jeanie Deans and her father in Sir Walter Scott’s novel.\r\nPerhaps a work which should chronicle the opposite course, which should\r\ntrace out all the devious courses through which a man of the world, a\r\nman of ambitions, drags his conscience, just steering clear of crime\r\nthat he may gain his end and yet save appearances, such a chronicle\r\nwould be no less edifying and no less dramatic.\r\n\r\nRastignac went home. He was fascinated by Mme. de Nucingen; he seemed to\r\nsee her before him, slender and graceful as a swallow. He recalled the\r\nintoxicating sweetness of her eyes, her fair hair, the delicate silken\r\ntissue of the skin, beneath which it almost seemed to him that he could\r\nsee the blood coursing; the tones of her voice still exerted a spell\r\nover him; he had forgotten nothing; his walk perhaps heated his\r\nimagination by sending a glow of warmth through his veins. He knocked\r\nunceremoniously at Goriot’s door.\r\n\r\n“I have seen Mme. Delphine, neighbor,” said he.\r\n\r\n“Where?”\r\n\r\n“At the Italiens.”\r\n\r\n“Did she enjoy it?.... Just come inside,” and the old man left his bed,\r\nunlocked the door, and promptly returned again.\r\n\r\nIt was the first time that Eugene had been in Father Goriot’s room, and\r\nhe could not control his feeling of amazement at the contrast between\r\nthe den in which the father lived and the costume of the daughter whom\r\nhe had just beheld. The window was curtainless, the walls were damp, in\r\nplaces the varnished wall-paper had come away and gave glimpses of the\r\ngrimy yellow plaster beneath. The wretched bed on which the old man\r\nlay boasted but one thin blanket, and a wadded quilt made out of large\r\npieces of Mme. Vauquer’s old dresses. The floor was damp and gritty.\r\nOpposite the window stood a chest of drawers made of rosewood, one of\r\nthe old-fashioned kind with a curving front and brass handles, shaped\r\nlike rings of twisted vine stems covered with flowers and leaves. On a\r\nvenerable piece of furniture with a wooden shelf stood a ewer and\r\nbasin and shaving apparatus. A pair of shoes stood in one corner; a\r\nnight-table by the bed had neither a door nor marble slab. There was not\r\na trace of a fire in the empty grate; the square walnut table with\r\nthe crossbar against which Father Goriot had crushed and twisted his\r\nposset-dish stood near the hearth. The old man’s hat was lying on a\r\nbroken-down bureau. An armchair stuffed with straw and a couple of\r\nchairs completed the list of ramshackle furniture. From the tester of\r\nthe bed, tied to the ceiling by a piece of rag, hung a strip of some\r\ncheap material in large red and black checks. No poor drudge in a\r\ngarret could be worse lodged than Father Goriot in Mme. Vauquer’s\r\nlodging-house. The mere sight of the room sent a chill through you and\r\na sense of oppression; it was like the worst cell in a prison. Luckily,\r\nGoriot could not see the effect that his surroundings produced on Eugene\r\nas the latter deposited his candle on the night-table. The old man\r\nturned round, keeping the bedclothes huddled up to his chin.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he said, “and which do you like the best, Mme. de Restaud or\r\nMme. de Nucingen?”\r\n\r\n“I like Mme. Delphine the best,” said the law student, “because she\r\nloves you the best.”\r\n\r\nAt the words so heartily spoken the old man’s hand slipped out from\r\nunder the bedclothes and grasped Eugene’s.\r\n\r\n“Thank you, thank you,” he said, gratefully. “Then what did she say\r\nabout me?”\r\n\r\nThe student repeated the Baroness’ remarks with some embellishments of\r\nhis own, the old man listening the while as though he heard a voice from\r\nHeaven.\r\n\r\n“Dear child!” he said. “Yes, yes, she is very fond of me. But you must\r\nnot believe all that she tells you about Anastasie. The two sisters are\r\njealous of each other, you see, another proof of their affection. Mme.\r\nde Restaud is very fond of me too. I know she is. A father sees his\r\nchildren as God sees all of us; he looks into the very depths of their\r\nhearts; he knows their intentions; and both of them are so loving. Oh!\r\nif I only had good sons-in-law, I should be too happy, and I dare\r\nsay there is no perfect happiness here below. If I might live with\r\nthem--simply hear their voices, know that they are there, see them go\r\nand come as I used to do at home when they were still with me; why, my\r\nheart bounds at the thought.... Were they nicely dressed?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Eugene. “But, M. Goriot, how is it that your daughters have\r\nsuch fine houses, while you live in such a den as this?”\r\n\r\n“Dear me, why should I want anything better?” he replied, with seeming\r\ncarelessness. “I can’t quite explain to you how it is; I am not used to\r\nstringing words together properly, but it all lies there----” he said,\r\ntapping his heart. “My real life is in my two girls, you see; and so\r\nlong as they are happy, and smartly dressed, and have soft carpets under\r\ntheir feet, what does it matter what clothes I wear or where I lie down\r\nof a night? I shall never feel cold so long as they are warm; I shall\r\nnever feel dull if they are laughing. I have no troubles but theirs.\r\nWhen you, too, are a father, and you hear your children’s little voices,\r\nyou will say to yourself, ‘That has all come from me.’ You will feel\r\nthat those little ones are akin to every drop in your veins, that they\r\nare the very flower of your life (and what else are they?); you will\r\ncleave so closely to them that you seem to feel every movement that they\r\nmake. Everywhere I hear their voices sounding in my ears. If they are\r\nsad, the look in their eyes freezes my blood. Some day you will find\r\nout that there is far more happiness in another’s happiness than in your\r\nown. It is something that I cannot explain, something within that sends\r\na glow of warmth all through you. In short, I live my life three times\r\nover. Shall I tell you something funny? Well, then, since I have been\r\na father, I have come to understand God. He is everywhere in the world,\r\nbecause the whole world comes from Him. And it is just the same with my\r\nchildren, monsieur. Only, I love my daughters better than God loves\r\nthe world, for the world is not so beautiful as God Himself is, but my\r\nchildren are more beautiful than I am. Their lives are so bound up with\r\nmine that I felt somehow that you would see them this evening. Great\r\nHeaven! If any man would make my little Delphine as happy as a wife is\r\nwhen she is loved, I would black his boots and run on his errands. That\r\nmiserable M. de Marsay is a cur; I know all about him from her maid. A\r\nlonging to wring his neck comes over me now and then. He does not love\r\nher! does not love a pearl of a woman, with a voice like a nightingale\r\nand shaped like a model. Where can her eyes have been when she married\r\nthat great lump of an Alsatian? They ought both of them to have married\r\nyoung men, good-looking and good-tempered--but, after all, they had\r\ntheir own way.”\r\n\r\nFather Goriot was sublime. Eugene had never yet seen his face light\r\nup as it did now with the passionate fervor of a father’s love. It is\r\nworthy of remark that strong feeling has a very subtle and pervasive\r\npower; the roughest nature, in the endeavor to express a deep and\r\nsincere affection, communicates to others the influence that has put\r\nresonance into the voice, and eloquence into every gesture, wrought a\r\nchange in the very features of the speaker; for under the inspiration\r\nof passion the stupidest human being attains to the highest eloquence of\r\nideas, if not of language, and seems to move in some sphere of light.\r\nIn the old man’s tones and gesture there was something just then of the\r\nsame spell that a great actor exerts over his audience. But does not the\r\npoet in us find expression in our affections?\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Eugene, “perhaps you will not be sorry to hear that she is\r\npretty sure to break with de Marsay before long. That sprig of fashion\r\nhas left her for the Princesse Galathionne. For my part, I fell in love\r\nwith Mme. Delphine this evening.”\r\n\r\n“Stuff!” said Father Goriot.\r\n\r\n“I did indeed, and she did not regard me with aversion. For a whole hour\r\nwe talked of love, and I am to go to call on her on Saturday, the day\r\nafter to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! how I should love you, if she should like you. You are\r\nkind-hearted; you would never make her miserable. If you were to forsake\r\nher, I would cut your throat at once. A woman does not love twice, you\r\nsee! Good heavens! what nonsense I am talking, M. Eugene! It is cold;\r\nyou ought not to stay here. _Mon Dieu!_ so you have heard her speak?\r\nWhat message did she give you for me?”\r\n\r\n“None at all,” said Eugene to himself; aloud he answered, “She told me\r\nto tell you that your daughter sends you a good kiss.”\r\n\r\n“Good-night, neighbor! Sleep well, and pleasant dreams to you! I have\r\nmine already made for me by that message from her. May God grant you\r\nall your desires! You have come in like a good angel on me to-night, and\r\nbrought with you the air that my daughter breathes.”\r\n\r\n“Poor old fellow!” said Eugene as he lay down. “It is enough to melt a\r\nheart of stone. His daughter no more thought of him than of the Grand\r\nTurk.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEver after this conference Goriot looked upon his neighbor as a\r\nfriend, a confidant such as he had never hoped to find; and there was\r\nestablished between the two the only relationship that could attach this\r\nold man to another man. The passions never miscalculate. Father Goriot\r\nfelt that this friendship brought him closer to his daughter Delphine;\r\nhe thought that he should find a warmer welcome for himself if the\r\nBaroness should care for Eugene. Moreover, he had confided one of his\r\ntroubles to the younger man. Mme. de Nucingen, for whose happiness he\r\nprayed a thousand times daily, had never known the joys of love. Eugene\r\nwas certainly (to make use of his own expression) one of the nicest\r\nyoung men that he had ever seen, and some prophetic instinct seemed to\r\ntell him that Eugene was to give her the happiness which had not been\r\nhers. These were the beginnings of a friendship that grew up between the\r\nold man and his neighbor; but for this friendship the catastrophe of the\r\ndrama must have remained a mystery.\r\n\r\nThe affection with which Father Goriot regarded Eugene, by whom he\r\nseated himself at breakfast, the change in Goriot’s face, which as a\r\nrule, looked as expressionless as a plaster cast, and a few words that\r\npassed between the two, surprised the other lodgers. Vautrin, who saw\r\nEugene for the first time since their interview, seemed as if he would\r\nfain read the student’s very soul. During the night Eugene had had some\r\ntime in which to scan the vast field which lay before him; and now, as\r\nhe remembered yesterday’s proposal, the thought of Mlle. Taillefer’s\r\ndowry came, of course, to his mind, and he could not help thinking\r\nof Victorine as the most exemplary youth may think of an heiress. It\r\nchanced that their eyes met. The poor girl did not fail to see that\r\nEugene looked very handsome in his new clothes. So much was said in\r\nthe glance, thus exchanged, that Eugene could not doubt but that he was\r\nassociated in her mind with the vague hopes that lie dormant in a girl’s\r\nheart and gather round the first attractive newcomer. “Eight hundred\r\nthousand francs!” a voice cried in his ears, but suddenly he took refuge\r\nin the memories of yesterday evening, thinking that his extemporized\r\npassion for Mme. de Nucingen was a talisman that would preserve him from\r\nthis temptation.\r\n\r\n“They gave Rossini’s _Barber of Seville_ at the Italiens yesterday\r\nevening,” he remarked. “I never heard such delicious music. Good\r\ngracious! how lucky people are to have a box at the Italiens!”\r\n\r\nFather Goriot drank in every word that Eugene let fall, and watched him\r\nas a dog watches his master’s slightest movement.\r\n\r\n“You men are like fighting cocks,” said Mme. Vauquer; “you do what you\r\nlike.”\r\n\r\n“How did you get back?” inquired Vautrin.\r\n\r\n“I walked,” answered Eugene.\r\n\r\n“For my own part,” remarked the tempter, “I do not care about doing\r\nthings by halves. If I want to enjoy myself that way, I should prefer\r\nto go in my carriage, sit in my own box, and do the thing comfortably.\r\nEverything or nothing; that is my motto.”\r\n\r\n“And a good one, too,” commented Mme. Vauquer.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you will see Mme. de Nucingen to-day,” said Eugene, addressing\r\nGoriot in an undertone. “She will welcome you with open arms, I am sure;\r\nshe would want to ask you for all sorts of little details about me. I\r\nhave found out that she will do anything in the world to be known by my\r\ncousin Mme. de Beauseant; don’t forget to tell her that I love her too\r\nwell not to think of trying to arrange this.”\r\n\r\nRastignac went at once to the Ecole de Droit. He had no mind to stay\r\na moment longer than was necessary in that odious house. He wasted his\r\ntime that day; he had fallen a victim to that fever of the brain that\r\naccompanies the too vivid hopes of youth. Vautrin’s arguments had set\r\nhim meditating on social life, and he was deep in these reflections when\r\nhe happened on his friend Bianchon in the Jardin du Luxembourg.\r\n\r\n“What makes you look so solemn?” said the medical student, putting an\r\narm through Eugene’s as they went towards the Palais.\r\n\r\n“I am tormented by temptations.”\r\n\r\n“What kind? There is a cure for temptation.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Yielding to it.”\r\n\r\n“You laugh, but you don’t know what it is all about. Have you read\r\nRousseau?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Do you remember that he asks the reader somewhere what he would do if\r\nhe could make a fortune by killing an old mandarin somewhere in China by\r\nmere force of wishing it, and without stirring from Paris?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then?”\r\n\r\n“Pshaw! I am at my thirty-third mandarin.”\r\n\r\n“Seriously, though. Look here, suppose you were sure that you could do\r\nit, and had only to give a nod. Would you do it?”\r\n\r\n“Is he well stricken in years, this mandarin of yours? Pshaw! after all,\r\nyoung or old, paralytic, or well and sound, my word for it. ... Well,\r\nthen. Hang it, no!”\r\n\r\n“You are a good fellow, Bianchon. But suppose you loved a woman well\r\nenough to lose your soul in hell for her, and that she wanted money for\r\ndresses and a carriage, and all her whims, in fact?”\r\n\r\n“Why, here you are taking away my reason, and want me to reason!”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, Bianchon, I am mad; bring me to my senses. I have two\r\nsisters as beautiful and innocent as angels, and I want them to be\r\nhappy. How am I to find two hundred thousand francs apiece for them in\r\nthe next five years? Now and then in life, you see, you must play for\r\nheavy stakes, and it is no use wasting your luck on low play.”\r\n\r\n“But you are only stating the problem that lies before every one at the\r\noutset of his life, and you want to cut the Gordian knot with a sword.\r\nIf that is the way of it, dear boy, you must be an Alexander, or to the\r\nhulks you go. For my own part, I am quite contented with the little lot\r\nI mean to make for myself somewhere in the country, when I mean to step\r\ninto my father’s shoes and plod along. A man’s affections are just\r\nas fully satisfied by the smallest circle as they can be by a vast\r\ncircumference. Napoleon himself could only dine once, and he could not\r\nhave more mistresses than a house student at the Capuchins. Happiness,\r\nold man, depends on what lies between the sole of your foot and the\r\ncrown of your head; and whether it costs a million or a hundred louis,\r\nthe actual amount of pleasure that you receive rests entirely with you,\r\nand is just exactly the same in any case. I am for letting that Chinaman\r\nlive.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Bianchon; you have done me good. We will always be friends.”\r\n\r\n“I say,” remarked the medical student, as they came to the end of a\r\nbroad walk in the Jardin des Plantes, “I saw the Michonneau and Poiret a\r\nfew minutes ago on a bench chatting with a gentleman whom I used to see\r\nin last year’s troubles hanging about the Chamber of Deputies; he seems\r\nto me, in fact, to be a detective dressed up like a decent retired\r\ntradesman. Let us keep an eye on that couple; I will tell you why some\r\ntime. Good-bye; it is nearly four o’clock, and I must be in to answer to\r\nmy name.”\r\n\r\nWhen Eugene reached the lodging-house, he found Father Goriot waiting\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\n“Here,” cried the old man, “here is a letter from her. Pretty\r\nhandwriting, eh?”\r\n\r\nEugene broke the seal and read:--\r\n\r\n\r\n “Sir,--I have heard from my father that you are fond of Italian\r\n  music. I shall be delighted if you will do me the pleasure of\r\n  accepting a seat in my box. La Fodor and Pellegrini will sing on\r\n  Saturday, so I am sure that you will not refuse me. M. de Nucingen\r\n  and I shall be pleased if you will dine with us; we shall be quite\r\n  by ourselves. If you will come and be my escort, my husband will\r\n  be glad to be relieved from his conjugal duties. Do not answer,\r\n  but simply come.--Yours sincerely, D. DE N.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Let me see it,” said Father Goriot, when Eugene had read the letter.\r\n“You are going, aren’t you?” he added, when he had smelled the\r\nwriting-paper. “How nice it smells! Her fingers have touched it, that is\r\ncertain.”\r\n\r\n“A woman does not fling herself at a man’s head in this way,” the\r\nstudent was thinking. “She wants to use me to bring back de Marsay;\r\nnothing but pique makes a woman do a thing like this.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Father Goriot, “what are you thinking about?”\r\n\r\nEugene did not know the fever or vanity that possessed some women in\r\nthose days; how should he imagine that to open a door in the Faubourg\r\nSaint-Germain a banker’s wife would go to almost any length. For the\r\ncoterie of the Faubourg Saint-Germain was a charmed circle, and the\r\nwomen who moved in it were at that time the queens of society; and among\r\nthe greatest of these _Dames du Petit-Chateau_, as they were called,\r\nwere Mme. de Beauseant and her friends the Duchesse de Langeais and the\r\nDuchesse de Maufrigneause. Rastignac was alone in his ignorance of the\r\nfrantic efforts made by women who lived in the Chausee-d’Antin to enter\r\nthis seventh heaven and shine among the brightest constellations of\r\ntheir sex. But his cautious disposition stood him in good stead,\r\nand kept his judgment cool, and the not altogether enviable power of\r\nimposing instead of accepting conditions.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I am going,” he replied.\r\n\r\nSo it was curiosity that drew him to Mme. de Nucingen; while, if she had\r\ntreated him disdainfully, passion perhaps might have brought him to her\r\nfeet. Still he waited almost impatiently for to-morrow, and the hour\r\nwhen he could go to her. There is almost as much charm for a young\r\nman in a first flirtation as there is in first love. The certainty of\r\nsuccess is a source of happiness to which men do not confess, and all\r\nthe charm of certain women lies in this. The desire of conquest springs\r\nno less from the easiness than from the difficulty of triumph, and every\r\npassion is excited or sustained by one or the other of these two motives\r\nwhich divide the empire of love. Perhaps this division is one result of\r\nthe great question of temperaments; which, after all, dominates social\r\nlife. The melancholic temperament may stand in need of the tonic of\r\ncoquetry, while those of nervous or sanguine complexion withdraw if\r\nthey meet with a too stubborn resistance. In other words, the lymphatic\r\ntemperament is essentially despondent, and the rhapsodic is bilious.\r\n\r\nEugene lingered over his toilette with an enjoyment of all its little\r\ndetails that is grateful to a young man’s self-love, though he will not\r\nown to it for fear of being laughed at. He thought, as he arranged his\r\nhair, that a pretty woman’s glances would wander through the dark curls.\r\nHe indulged in childish tricks like any young girl dressing for a dance,\r\nand gazed complacently at his graceful figure while he smoothed out the\r\ncreases of his coat.\r\n\r\n“There are worse figures, that is certain,” he said to himself.\r\n\r\nThen he went downstairs, just as the rest of the household were sitting\r\ndown to dinner, and took with good humor the boisterous applause excited\r\nby his elegant appearance. The amazement with which any attention to\r\ndress is regarded in a lodging-house is a very characteristic trait. No\r\none can put on a new coat but every one else must say his say about it.\r\n\r\n“Clk! clk! clk!” cried Bianchon, making the sound with his tongue\r\nagainst the roof of his mouth, like a driver urging on a horse.\r\n\r\n“He holds himself like a duke and a peer of France,” said Mme. Vauquer.\r\n\r\n“Are you going a-courting?” inquired Mlle. Michonneau.\r\n\r\n“Cock-a-doodle-doo!” cried the artist.\r\n\r\n“My compliments to my lady your wife,” from the _employe_ at the Museum.\r\n\r\n“Your wife; have you a wife?” asked Poiret.\r\n\r\n“Yes, in compartments, water-tight and floats, guaranteed fast color,\r\nall prices from twenty-five to forty sous, neat check patterns in the\r\nlatest fashion and best taste, will wash, half-linen, half-cotton,\r\nhalf-wool; a certain cure for toothache and other complaints under the\r\npatronage of the Royal College of Physicians! children like it! a remedy\r\nfor headache, indigestion, and all other diseases affecting the\r\nthroat, eyes, and ears!” cried Vautrin, with a comical imitation of the\r\nvolubility of a quack at a fair. “And how much shall we say for this\r\nmarvel, gentlemen? Twopence? No. Nothing of the sort. All that is left\r\nin stock after supplying the Great Mogul. All the crowned heads of\r\nEurope, including the Gr-r-rand Duke of Baden, have been anxious to get\r\na sight of it. Walk up! walk up! gentlemen! Pay at the desk as you go\r\nin! Strike up the music there! Brooum, la, la, trinn! la, la, boum!\r\nboum! Mister Clarinette, there you are out of tune!” he added gruffly;\r\n“I will rap your knuckles for you!”\r\n\r\n“Goodness! what an amusing man!” said Mme. Vauquer to Mme. Couture; “I\r\nshould never feel dull with him in the house.”\r\n\r\nThis burlesque of Vautrin’s was the signal for an outburst of merriment,\r\nand under cover of jokes and laughter Eugene caught a glance from Mlle.\r\nTaillefer; she had leaned over to say a few words in Mme. Couture’s ear.\r\n\r\n“The cab is at the door,” announced Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“But where is he going to dine?” asked Bianchon.\r\n\r\n“With Madame la Baronne de Nucingen.”\r\n\r\n“M. Goriot’s daughter,” said the law student.\r\n\r\nAt this, all eyes turned to the old vermicelli maker; he was gazing at\r\nEugene with something like envy in his eyes.\r\n\r\nRastignac reached the house in the Rue Saint-Lazare, one of those\r\nmany-windowed houses with a mean-looking portico and slender columns,\r\nwhich are considered the thing in Paris, a typical banker’s house,\r\ndecorated in the most ostentatious fashion; the walls lined with stucco,\r\nthe landings of marble mosaic. Mme. de Nucingen was sitting in a little\r\ndrawing-room; the room was painted in the Italian fashion, and decorated\r\nlike a restaurant. The Baroness seemed depressed. The effort that she\r\nmade to hide her feelings aroused Eugene’s interest; it was plain\r\nthat she was not playing a part. He had expected a little flutter of\r\nexcitement at his coming, and he found her dispirited and sad. The\r\ndisappointment piqued his vanity.\r\n\r\n“My claim to your confidence is very small, madame,” he said, after\r\nrallying her on her abstracted mood; “but if I am in the way, please\r\ntell me so frankly; I count on your good faith.”\r\n\r\n“No, stay with me,” she said; “I shall be all alone if you go. Nucingen\r\nis dining in town, and I do not want to be alone; I want to be taken out\r\nof myself.”\r\n\r\n“But what is the matter?”\r\n\r\n“You are the very last person whom I should tell,” she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Then I am connected in some way in this secret. I wonder what it is?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps. Yet, no,” she went on; “it is a domestic quarrel, which ought\r\nto be buried in the depths of the heart. I am very unhappy; did I not\r\ntell you so the day before yesterday? Golden chains are the heaviest of\r\nall fetters.”\r\n\r\nWhen a woman tells a young man that she is very unhappy, and when the\r\nyoung man is clever, and well dressed, and has fifteen hundred francs\r\nlying idle in his pocket, he is sure to think as Eugene said, and he\r\nbecomes a coxcomb.\r\n\r\n“What can you have left to wish for?” he answered. “You are young,\r\nbeautiful, beloved, and rich.”\r\n\r\n“Do not let us talk of my affairs,” she said shaking her head\r\nmournfully. “We will dine together _tete-a-tete_, and afterwards we will\r\ngo to hear the most exquisite music. Am I to your taste?” she went on,\r\nrising and displaying her gown of white cashmere, covered with Persian\r\ndesigns in the most superb taste.\r\n\r\n“I wish that you were altogether mine,” said Eugene; “you are charming.”\r\n\r\n“You would have a forlorn piece of property,” she said, smiling\r\nbitterly. “There is nothing about me that betrays my wretchedness;\r\nand yet, in spite of appearances, I am in despair. I cannot sleep; my\r\ntroubles have broken my night’s rest; I shall grow ugly.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! that is impossible,” cried the law student; “but I am curious to\r\nknow what these troubles can be that a devoted love cannot efface.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! if I were to tell you about them, you would shun me,” she said.\r\n“Your love for me is as yet only the conventional gallantry that men use\r\nto masquerade in; and, if you really loved me, you would be driven to\r\ndespair. I must keep silence, you see. Let us talk of something else,\r\nfor pity’s sake,” she added. “Let me show you my rooms.”\r\n\r\n“No; let us stay here,” answered Eugene; he sat down on the sofa\r\nbefore the fire, and boldly took Mme. de Nucingen’s hand in his. She\r\nsurrendered it to him; he even felt the pressure of her fingers in one\r\nof the spasmodic clutches that betray terrible agitation.\r\n\r\n“Listen,” said Rastignac; “if you are in trouble, you ought to tell me\r\nabout it. I want to prove to you that I love you for yourself alone. You\r\nmust speak to me frankly about your troubles, so that I can put an end\r\nto them, even if I have to kill half-a-dozen men; or I shall go, never\r\nto return.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” she cried, putting her hand to her forehead in an agony of\r\ndespair, “I will put you to the proof, and this very moment. Yes,” she\r\nsaid to herself, “I have no other resource left.”\r\n\r\nShe rang the bell.\r\n\r\n“Are the horses put in for the master?” she asked of the servant.\r\n\r\n“Yes, madame.”\r\n\r\n“I shall take his carriage myself. He can have mine and my horses. Serve\r\ndinner at seven o’clock.”\r\n\r\n“Now, come with me,” she said to Eugene, who thought as he sat in\r\nthe banker’s carriage beside Mme. de Nucingen that he must surely be\r\ndreaming.\r\n\r\n“To the Palais-Royal,” she said to the coachman; “stop near the\r\nTheatre-Francais.”\r\n\r\nShe seemed to be too troubled and excited to answer the innumerable\r\nquestions that Eugene put to her. He was at a loss what to think of her\r\nmute resistance, her obstinate silence.\r\n\r\n“Another moment and she will escape me,” he said to himself.\r\n\r\nWhen the carriage stopped at last, the Baroness gave the law student a\r\nglance that silenced his wild words, for he was almost beside himself.\r\n\r\n“Is it true that you love me?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he answered, and in his manner and tone there was no trace of the\r\nuneasiness that he felt.\r\n\r\n“You will not think ill of me, will you, whatever I may ask of you?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Are you ready to do my bidding?”\r\n\r\n“Blindly.”\r\n\r\n“Have you ever been to a gaming-house?” she asked in a tremulous voice.\r\n\r\n“Never.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! now I can breathe. You will have luck. Here is my purse,” she said.\r\n“Take it! there are a hundred francs in it, all that such a fortunate\r\nwoman as I can call her own. Go up into one of the gaming-houses--I do\r\nnot know where they are, but there are some near the Palais-Royal. Try\r\nyour luck with the hundred francs at a game they call roulette; lose\r\nit all or bring me back six thousand francs. I will tell you about my\r\ntroubles when you come back.”\r\n\r\n“Devil take me, I’m sure, if I have a glimmer of a notion of what I am\r\nabout, but I will obey you,” he added, with inward exultation, as he\r\nthought, “She has gone too far to draw back--she can refuse me nothing\r\nnow!”\r\n\r\nEugene took the dainty little purse, inquired the way of a second-hand\r\nclothes-dealer, and hurried to number 9, which happened to be the\r\nnearest gaming-house. He mounted the staircase, surrendered his hat, and\r\nasked the way to the roulette-table, whither the attendant took him, not\r\na little to the astonishment of the regular comers. All eyes were fixed\r\non Eugene as he asked, without bashfulness, where he was to deposit his\r\nstakes.\r\n\r\n“If you put a louis on one only of those thirty-six numbers, and it\r\nturns up, you will win thirty-six louis,” said a respectable-looking,\r\nwhite-haired old man in answer to his inquiry.\r\n\r\nEugene staked the whole of his money on the number 21 (his own age).\r\nThere was a cry of surprise; before he knew what he had done, he had\r\nwon.\r\n\r\n“Take your money off, sir,” said the old gentleman; “you don’t often win\r\ntwice running by that system.”\r\n\r\nEugene took the rake that the old man handed to him, and drew in his\r\nthree thousand six hundred francs, and, still perfectly ignorant of\r\nwhat he was about, staked again on the red. The bystanders watched him\r\nenviously as they saw him continue to play. The disc turned, and again\r\nhe won; the banker threw him three thousand six hundred francs once\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n“You have seven thousand, two hundred francs of your own,” the old\r\ngentleman said in his ear. “Take my advice and go away with your\r\nwinnings; red has turned up eight times already. If you are charitable,\r\nyou will show your gratitude for sound counsel by giving a trifle to an\r\nold prefect of Napoleon who is down on his luck.”\r\n\r\nRastignac’s head was swimming; he saw ten of his louis pass into the\r\nwhite-haired man’s possession, and went down-stairs with his seven\r\nthousand francs; he was still ignorant of the game, and stupefied by his\r\nluck.\r\n\r\n“So, that is over; and now where will you take me?” he asked, as soon as\r\nthe door was closed, and he showed the seven thousand francs to Mme. de\r\nNucingen.\r\n\r\nDelphine flung her arms about him, but there was no passion in that wild\r\nembrace.\r\n\r\n“You have saved me!” she cried, and tears of joy flowed fast.\r\n\r\n“I will tell you everything, my friend. For you will be my friend, will\r\nyou not? I am rich, you think, very rich; I have everything I want, or\r\nI seem as if I had everything. Very well, you must know that M. de\r\nNucingen does not allow me the control of a single penny; he pays all\r\nthe bills for the house expenses; he pays for my carriages and opera\r\nbox; he does not give me enough to pay for my dress, and he reduces\r\nme to poverty in secret on purpose. I am too proud to beg from him. I\r\nshould be the vilest of women if I could take his money at the price at\r\nwhich he offers it. Do you ask how I, with seven hundred thousand francs\r\nof my own, could let myself be robbed? It is because I was proud, and\r\nscorned to speak. We are so young, so artless when our married life\r\nbegins! I never could bring myself to ask my husband for money; the\r\nwords would have made my lips bleed, I did not dare to ask; I spent my\r\nsavings first, and then the money that my poor father gave me, then I\r\nran into debt. Marriage for me is a hideous farce; I cannot talk about\r\nit, let it suffice to say that Nucingen and I have separate rooms, and\r\nthat I would fling myself out of the window sooner than consent to any\r\nother manner of life. I suffered agonies when I had to confess to my\r\ngirlish extravagance, my debts for jewelry and trifles (for our poor\r\nfather had never refused us anything, and spoiled us), but at last I\r\nfound courage to tell him about them. After all, I had a fortune of my\r\nown. Nucingen flew into a rage; he said that I should be the ruin of\r\nhim, and used frightful language! I wished myself a hundred feet down\r\nin the earth. He had my dowry, so he paid my debts, but he stipulated at\r\nthe same time that my expenses in future must not exceed a certain fixed\r\nsum, and I gave way for the sake of peace. And then,” she went on, “I\r\nwanted to gratify the self-love of some one whom you know. He may have\r\ndeceived me, but I should do him the justice to say that there was\r\nnothing petty in his character. But, after all, he threw me over\r\ndisgracefully. If, at a woman’s utmost need, _somebody_ heaps gold upon\r\nher, he ought never to forsake her; that love should last for ever!\r\nBut you, at one-and-twenty, you, the soul of honor, with the unsullied\r\nconscience of youth, will ask me how a woman can bring herself to accept\r\nmoney in such a way? _Mon Dieu_! is it not natural to share everything\r\nwith the one to whom we owe our happiness? When all has been given, why\r\nshould we pause and hesitate over a part? Money is as nothing between\r\nus until the moment when the sentiment that bound us together ceases to\r\nexist. Were we not bound to each other for life? Who that believes in\r\nlove foresees such an end to love? You swear to love us eternally; how,\r\nthen, can our interests be separate?\r\n\r\n“You do not know how I suffered to-day when Nucingen refused to give\r\nme six thousand francs; he spends as much as that every month on his\r\nmistress, an opera dancer! I thought of killing myself. The wildest\r\nthoughts came into my head. There have been moments in my life when I\r\nhave envied my servants, and would have changed places with my maid. It\r\nwas madness to think of going to our father, Anastasie and I have bled\r\nhim dry; our poor father would have sold himself if he could have raised\r\nsix thousand francs that way. I should have driven him frantic to no\r\npurpose. You have saved me from shame and death; I was beside myself\r\nwith anguish. Ah! monsieur, I owed you this explanation after my mad\r\nravings. When you left me just now, as soon as you were out of sight, I\r\nlonged to escape, to run away... where, I did not know. Half the women\r\nin Paris lead such lives as mine; they live in apparent luxury, and in\r\ntheir souls are tormented by anxiety. I know of poor creatures even\r\nmore miserable than I; there are women who are driven to ask their\r\ntradespeople to make out false bills, women who rob their husbands. Some\r\nmen believe that an Indian shawl worth a thousand louis only cost five\r\nhundred francs, others that a shawl costing five hundred francs is worth\r\na hundred louis. There are women, too, with narrow incomes, who scrape\r\nand save and starve their children to pay for a dress. I am innocent\r\nof these base meannesses. But this is the last extremity of my torture.\r\nSome women will sell themselves to their husbands, and so obtain their\r\nway, but I, at any rate, am free. If I chose, Nucingen would cover me\r\nwith gold, but I would rather weep on the breast of a man whom I can\r\nrespect. Ah! tonight, M. de Marsay will no longer have a right to think\r\nof me as a woman whom he has paid.” She tried to conceal her tears from\r\nhim, hiding her face in her hands; Eugene drew them away and looked at\r\nher; she seemed to him sublime at that moment.\r\n\r\n“It is hideous, is it not,” she cried, “to speak in a breath of money\r\nand affection. You cannot love me after this,” she added.\r\n\r\nThe incongruity between the ideas of honor which make women so great,\r\nand the errors in conduct which are forced upon them by the constitution\r\nof society, had thrown Eugene’s thoughts into confusion; he uttered\r\nsoothing and consoling words, and wondered at the beautiful woman before\r\nhim, and at the artless imprudence of her cry of pain.\r\n\r\n“You will not remember this against me?” she asked; “promise me that you\r\nwill not.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! madame, I am incapable of doing so,” he said. She took his hand and\r\nheld it to her heart, a movement full of grace that expressed her deep\r\ngratitude.\r\n\r\n“I am free and happy once more, thanks to you,” she said. “Oh! I have\r\nfelt lately as if I were in the grasp of an iron hand. But after this\r\nI mean to live simply and to spend nothing. You will think me just as\r\npretty, will you not, my friend? Keep this,” she went on, as she took\r\nonly six of the banknotes. “In conscience I owe you a thousand crowns,\r\nfor I really ought to go halves with you.”\r\n\r\nEugene’s maiden conscience resisted; but when the Baroness said, “I\r\nam bound to look on you as an accomplice or as an enemy,” he took the\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n“It shall be a last stake in reserve,” he said, “in case of misfortune.”\r\n\r\n“That was what I was dreading to hear,” she cried, turning pale. “Oh,\r\nif you would that I should be anything to you, swear to me that you will\r\nnever re-enter a gaming-house. Great Heaven! that I should corrupt you!\r\nI should die of sorrow!”\r\n\r\nThey had reached the Rue Saint-Lazare by this time. The contrast between\r\nthe ostentation of wealth in the house, and the wretched condition of\r\nits mistress, dazed the student; and Vautrin’s cynical words began to\r\nring in his ears.\r\n\r\n“Seat yourself there,” said the Baroness, pointing to a low chair beside\r\nthe fire. “I have a difficult letter to write,” she added. “Tell me what\r\nto say.”\r\n\r\n“Say nothing,” Eugene answered her. “Put the bills in an envelope,\r\ndirect it, and send it by your maid.”\r\n\r\n“Why, you are a love of a man,” she said. “Ah! see what it is to have\r\nbeen well brought up. That is the Beauseant through and through,” she\r\nwent on, smiling at him.\r\n\r\n“She is charming,” thought Eugene, more and more in love. He looked\r\nround him at the room; there was an ostentatious character about the\r\nluxury, a meretricious taste in the splendor.\r\n\r\n“Do you like it?” she asked, as she rang for the maid.\r\n\r\n“Therese, take this to M. de Marsay, and give it into his hands\r\nyourself. If he is not at home, bring the letter back to me.”\r\n\r\nTherese went, but not before she had given Eugene a spiteful glance.\r\n\r\nDinner was announced. Rastignac gave his arm to Mme. de Nucingen, she\r\nled the way into a pretty dining-room, and again he saw the luxury of\r\nthe table which he had admired in his cousin’s house.\r\n\r\n“Come and dine with me on opera evenings, and we will go to the Italiens\r\nafterwards,” she said.\r\n\r\n“I should soon grow used to the pleasant life if it could last, but I am\r\na poor student, and I have my way to make.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! you will succeed,” she said laughing. “You will see. All that you\r\nwish will come to pass. _I_ did not expect to be so happy.”\r\n\r\nIt is the wont of women to prove the impossible by the possible, and to\r\nannihilate facts by presentiments. When Mme. de Nucingen and Rastignac\r\ntook their places in her box at the Bouffons, her face wore a look of\r\nhappiness that made her so lovely that every one indulged in those small\r\nslanders against which women are defenceless; for the scandal that\r\nis uttered lightly is often seriously believed. Those who know Paris,\r\nbelieve nothing that is said, and say nothing of what is done there.\r\n\r\nEugene took the Baroness’ hand in his, and by some light pressure of the\r\nfingers, or a closer grasp of the hand, they found a language in which\r\nto express the sensations which the music gave them. It was an evening\r\nof intoxicating delight for both; and when it ended, and they went out\r\ntogether, Mme. de Nucingen insisted on taking Eugene with her as far as\r\nthe Pont Neuf, he disputing with her the whole of the way for a single\r\nkiss after all those that she had showered upon him so passionately at\r\nthe Palais-Royal; Eugene reproached her with inconsistency.\r\n\r\n“That was gratitude,” she said, “for devotion that I did not dare to\r\nhope for, but now it would be a promise.”\r\n\r\n“And will you give me no promise, ingrate?”\r\n\r\nHe grew vexed. Then, with one of those impatient gestures that fill a\r\nlover with ecstasy, she gave him her hand to kiss, and he took it with a\r\ndiscontented air that delighted her.\r\n\r\n“I shall see you at the ball on Monday,” she said.\r\n\r\nAs Eugene went home in the moonlight, he fell to serious reflections.\r\nHe was satisfied, and yet dissatisfied. He was pleased with an adventure\r\nwhich would probably give him his desire, for in the end one of the\r\nprettiest and best-dressed women in Paris would be his; but, as a\r\nset-off, he saw his hopes of fortune brought to nothing; and as soon as\r\nhe realized this fact, the vague thoughts of yesterday evening began to\r\ntake a more decided shape in his mind. A check is sure to reveal to us\r\nthe strength of our hopes. The more Eugene learned of the pleasures of\r\nlife in Paris, the more impatient he felt of poverty and obscurity. He\r\ncrumpled the banknote in his pocket, and found any quantity of plausible\r\nexcuses for appropriating it.\r\n\r\nHe reached the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve at last, and from the\r\nstairhead he saw a light in Goriot’s room; the old man had lighted a\r\ncandle, and set the door ajar, lest the student should pass him by, and\r\ngo to his room without “telling him all about his daughter,” to use\r\nhis own expression. Eugene, accordingly, told him everything without\r\nreserve.\r\n\r\n“Then they think that I am ruined!” cried Father Goriot, in an agony of\r\njealousy and desperation. “Why, I have still thirteen hundred livres a\r\nyear! _Mon Dieu!_ Poor little girl! why did she not come to me? I would\r\nhave sold my rentes; she should have had some of the principal, and I\r\nwould have bought a life-annuity with the rest. My good neighbor, why\r\ndid not _you_ come to tell me of her difficulty? How had you the\r\nheart to go and risk her poor little hundred francs at play? This is\r\nheart-breaking work. You see what it is to have sons-in-law. Oh! if I\r\nhad hold of them, I would wring their necks. _Mon Dieu! crying!_ Did you\r\nsay she was crying?”\r\n\r\n“With her head on my waistcoat,” said Eugene.\r\n\r\n“Oh! give it to me,” said Father Goriot. “What! my daughter’s tears have\r\nfallen there--my darling Delphine, who never used to cry when she was\r\na little girl! Oh! I will buy you another; do not wear it again; let me\r\nhave it. By the terms of her marriage-contract, she ought to have the\r\nuse of her property. To-morrow morning I will go and see Derville; he is\r\nan attorney. I will demand that her money should be invested in her own\r\nname. I know the law. I am an old wolf, I will show my teeth.”\r\n\r\n“Here, father; this is a banknote for a thousand francs that she wanted\r\nme to keep out of our winnings. Keep them for her, in the pocket of the\r\nwaistcoat.”\r\n\r\nGoriot looked hard at Eugene, reached out and took the law student’s\r\nhand, and Eugene felt a tear fall on it.\r\n\r\n“You will succeed,” the old man said. “God is just, you see. I know an\r\nhonest man when I see him, and I can tell you, there are not many men\r\nlike you. I am to have another dear child in you, am I? There, go to\r\nsleep; you can sleep; you are not yet a father. She was crying! and I\r\nhave to be told about it!--and I was quietly eating my dinner, like an\r\nidiot, all the time--I, who would sell the Father, Son and Holy Ghost to\r\nsave one tear to either of them.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“An honest man!” said Eugene to himself as he lay down. “Upon my word, I\r\nthink I will be an honest man all my life; it is so pleasant to obey\r\nthe voice of conscience.” Perhaps none but believers in God do good in\r\nsecret; and Eugene believed in a God.\r\n\r\nThe next day Rastignac went at the appointed time to Mme. de Beauseant,\r\nwho took him with her to the Duchesse de Carigliano’s ball. The\r\nMarechale received Eugene most graciously. Mme. de Nucingen was there.\r\nDelphine’s dress seemed to suggest that she wished for the admiration\r\nof others, so that she might shine the more in Eugene’s eyes; she\r\nwas eagerly expecting a glance from him, hiding, as she thought, this\r\neagerness from all beholders. This moment is full of charm for one who\r\ncan guess all that passes in a woman’s mind. Who has not refrained from\r\ngiving his opinion, to prolong her suspense, concealing his pleasure\r\nfrom a desire to tantalize, seeking a confession of love in her\r\nuneasiness, enjoying the fears that he can dissipate by a smile? In\r\nthe course of the evening the law student suddenly comprehended his\r\nposition; he saw that, as the cousin of Mme. de Beauseant, he was a\r\npersonage in this world. He was already credited with the conquest\r\nof Mme. de Nucingen, and for this reason was a conspicuous figure;\r\nhe caught the envious glances of other young men, and experienced the\r\nearliest pleasures of coxcombry. People wondered at his luck, and scraps\r\nof these conversations came to his ears as he went from room to room;\r\nall the women prophesied his success; and Delphine, in her dread of\r\nlosing him, promised that this evening she would not refuse the kiss\r\nthat all his entreaties could scarcely win yesterday.\r\n\r\nRastignac received several invitations. His cousin presented him to\r\nother women who were present; women who could claim to be of the highest\r\nfashion; whose houses were looked upon as pleasant; and this was\r\nthe loftiest and most fashionable society in Paris into which he was\r\nlaunched. So this evening had all the charm of a brilliant debut; it\r\nwas an evening that he was to remember even in old age, as a woman looks\r\nback upon her first ball and the memories of her girlish triumphs.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, at breakfast, he related the story of his success for\r\nthe benefit of Father Goriot and the lodgers. Vautrin began to smile in\r\na diabolical fashion.\r\n\r\n“And do you suppose,” cried that cold-blooded logician, “that a young\r\nman of fashion can live here in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve, in the\r\nMaison Vauquer--an exceedingly respectable boarding-house in every way,\r\nI grant you, but an establishment that, none the less, falls short\r\nof being fashionable? The house is comfortable, it is lordly in its\r\nabundance; it is proud to be the temporary abode of a Rastignac; but,\r\nafter all, it is in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve, and luxury would be\r\nout of place here, where we only aim at the purely _patriarchalorama_.\r\nIf you mean to cut a figure in Paris, my young friend,” Vautrin\r\ncontinued, with half-paternal jocularity, “you must have three horses,\r\na tilbury for the mornings, and a closed carriage for the evening; you\r\nshould spend altogether about nine thousand francs on your stables. You\r\nwould show yourself unworthy of your destiny if you spent no more than\r\nthree thousand francs with your tailor, six hundred in perfumery, a\r\nhundred crowns to your shoemaker, and a hundred more to your hatter. As\r\nfor your laundress, there goes another thousand francs; a young man of\r\nfashion must of necessity make a great point of his linen; if your linen\r\ncomes up to the required standard, people often do not look any further.\r\nLove and the Church demand a fair altar-cloth. That is fourteen thousand\r\nfrancs. I am saying nothing of losses at play, bets, and presents; it\r\nis impossible to allow less than two thousand francs for pocket money. I\r\nhave led that sort of life, and I know all about these expenses. Add the\r\ncost of necessaries next; three hundred louis for provender, a thousand\r\nfrancs for a place to roost in. Well, my boy, for all these little wants\r\nof ours we had need to have twenty-five thousand francs every year in\r\nour purse, or we shall find ourselves in the kennel, and people laughing\r\nat us, and our career is cut short, good-bye to success, and good-bye to\r\nyour mistress! I am forgetting your valet and your groom! Is Christophe\r\ngoing to carry your _billets-doux_ for you? Do you mean to employ the\r\nstationery you use at present? Suicidal policy! Hearken to the wisdom\r\nof your elders!” he went on, his bass voice growing louder at each\r\nsyllable. “Either take up your quarters in a garret, live virtuously,\r\nand wed your work, or set about the thing in a different way.”\r\n\r\nVautrin winked and leered in the direction of Mlle. Taillefer to enforce\r\nhis remarks by a look which recalled the late tempting proposals by\r\nwhich he had sought to corrupt the student’s mind.\r\n\r\nSeveral days went by, and Rastignac lived in a whirl of gaiety. He dined\r\nalmost every day with Mme. de Nucingen, and went wherever she went, only\r\nreturning to the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve in the small hours. He rose\r\nat mid-day, and dressed to go into the Bois with Delphine if the day was\r\nfine, squandering in this way time that was worth far more than he knew.\r\nHe turned as eagerly to learn the lessons of luxury, and was as quick\r\nto feel its fascination, as the flowers of the date palm to receive the\r\nfertilizing pollen. He played high, lost and won large sums of money,\r\nand at last became accustomed to the extravagant life that young men\r\nlead in Paris. He sent fifteen hundred francs out of his first winnings\r\nto his mother and sisters, sending handsome presents as well as the\r\nmoney. He had given out that he meant to leave the Maison Vauquer; but\r\nJanuary came and went, and he was still there, still unprepared to go.\r\n\r\nOne rule holds good of most young men--whether rich or poor. They never\r\nhave money for the necessaries of life, but they have always money to\r\nspare for their caprices--an anomaly which finds its explanation in\r\ntheir youth and in the almost frantic eagerness with which youth grasps\r\nat pleasure. They are reckless with anything obtained on credit, while\r\neverything for which they must pay in ready money is made to last as\r\nlong as possible; if they cannot have all that they want, they make\r\nup for it, it would seem, by squandering what they have. To state the\r\nmatter simply--a student is far more careful of his hat than of his\r\ncoat, because the latter being a comparatively costly article of dress,\r\nit is in the nature of things that a tailor should be a creditor; but\r\nit is otherwise with the hatter; the sums of money spent with him are so\r\nmodest, that he is the most independent and unmanageable of his tribe,\r\nand it is almost impossible to bring him to terms. The young man in the\r\nbalcony of a theatre who displays a gorgeous waistcoat for the benefit\r\nof the fair owners of opera glasses, has very probably no socks in his\r\nwardrobe, for the hosier is another of the genus of weevils that nibble\r\nat the purse. This was Rastignac’s condition. His purse was always\r\nempty for Mme. Vauquer, always full at the demand of vanity; there was\r\na periodical ebb and flow in his fortunes, which was seldom favorable\r\nto the payment of just debts. If he was to leave that unsavory and mean\r\nabode, where from time to time his pretensions met with humiliation, the\r\nfirst step was to pay his hostess for a month’s board and lodging, and\r\nthe second to purchase furniture worthy of the new lodgings he must take\r\nin his quality of dandy, a course that remained impossible. Rastignac,\r\nout of his winnings at cards, would pay his jeweler exorbitant prices\r\nfor gold watches and chains, and then, to meet the exigencies of play,\r\nwould carry them to the pawnbroker, that discreet and forbidding-looking\r\nfriend of youth; but when it was a question of paying for board or\r\nlodging, or for the necessary implements for the cultivation of his\r\nElysian fields, his imagination and pluck alike deserted him. There was\r\nno inspiration to be found in vulgar necessity, in debts contracted for\r\npast requirements. Like most of those who trust to their luck, he put\r\noff till the last moment the payment of debts that among the bourgeoisie\r\nare regarded as sacred engagements, acting on the plan of Mirabeau,\r\nwho never settled his baker’s bill until it underwent a formidable\r\ntransformation into a bill of exchange.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time when Rastignac was down on his luck and fell into\r\ndebt, that it became clear to the law student’s mind that he must have\r\nsome more certain source of income if he meant to live as he had been\r\ndoing. But while he groaned over the thorny problems of his precarious\r\nsituation, he felt that he could not bring himself to renounce the\r\npleasures of this extravagant life, and decided that he must continue it\r\nat all costs. His dreams of obtaining a fortune appeared more and more\r\nchimerical, and the real obstacles grew more formidable. His initiation\r\ninto the secrets of the Nucingen household had revealed to him that if\r\nhe were to attempt to use this love affair as a means of mending his\r\nfortunes, he must swallow down all sense of decency, and renounce all\r\nthe generous ideas which redeem the sins of youth. He had chosen this\r\nlife of apparent splendor, but secretly gnawed by the canker worm of\r\nremorse, a life of fleeting pleasure dearly paid for by persistent pain;\r\nlike _Le Distrait_ of La Bruyere, he had descended so far as to make\r\nhis bed in a ditch; but (also like _Le Distrait_) he himself was\r\nuncontaminated as yet by the mire that stained his garments.\r\n\r\n“So we have killed our mandarin, have we?” said Bianchon one day as they\r\nleft the dinner table.\r\n\r\n“Not yet,” he answered, “but he is at his last gasp.”\r\n\r\nThe medical student took this for a joke, but it was not a jest. Eugene\r\nhad dined in the house that night for the first time for a long while,\r\nand had looked thoughtful during the meal. He had taken his place beside\r\nMlle. Taillefer, and stayed through the dessert, giving his neighbor an\r\nexpressive glance from time to time. A few of the boarders discussed\r\nthe walnuts at the table, and others walked about the room, still taking\r\npart in the conversation which had begun among them. People usually went\r\nwhen they chose; the amount of time that they lingered being determined\r\nby the amount of interest that the conversation possessed for them, or\r\nby the difficulty of the process of digestion. In winter-time the room\r\nwas seldom empty before eight o’clock, when the four women had it all to\r\nthemselves, and made up for the silence previously imposed upon them by\r\nthe preponderating masculine element. This evening Vautrin had noticed\r\nEugene’s abstractedness, and stayed in the room, though he had seemed\r\nto be in a hurry to finish his dinner and go. All through the talk\r\nafterwards he had kept out of the sight of the law student, who quite\r\nbelieved that Vautrin had left the room. He now took up his position\r\ncunningly in the sitting-room instead of going when the last boarders\r\nwent. He had fathomed the young man’s thoughts, and felt that a crisis\r\nwas at hand. Rastignac was, in fact, in a dilemma, which many another\r\nyoung man must have known.\r\n\r\nMme. de Nucingen might love him, or might merely be playing with\r\nhim, but in either case Rastignac had been made to experience all\r\nthe alternations of hope and despair of genuine passion, and all\r\nthe diplomatic arts of a Parisienne had been employed on him. After\r\ncompromising herself by continually appearing in public with Mme. de\r\nBeauseant’s cousin she still hesitated, and would not give him the\r\nlover’s privileges which he appeared to enjoy. For a whole month she had\r\nso wrought on his senses, that at last she had made an impression on\r\nhis heart. If in the earliest days the student had fancied himself to be\r\nmaster, Mme. de Nucingen had since become the stronger of the two, for\r\nshe had skilfully roused and played upon every instinct, good or bad, in\r\nthe two or three men comprised in a young student in Paris. This was not\r\nthe result of deep design on her part, nor was she playing a part, for\r\nwomen are in a manner true to themselves even through their grossest\r\ndeceit, because their actions are prompted by a natural impulse. It may\r\nhave been that Delphine, who had allowed this young man to gain such an\r\nascendency over her, conscious that she had been too demonstrative, was\r\nobeying a sentiment of dignity, and either repented of her concessions,\r\nor it pleased her to suspend them. It is so natural to a Parisienne,\r\neven when passion has almost mastered her, to hesitate and pause before\r\ntaking the plunge; to probe the heart of him to whom she intrusts her\r\nfuture. And once already Mme. de Nucingen’s hopes had been betrayed,\r\nand her loyalty to a selfish young lover had been despised. She had good\r\nreason to be suspicious. Or it may have been that something in Eugene’s\r\nmanner (for his rapid success was making a coxcomb of him) had warned\r\nher that the grotesque nature of their position had lowered her somewhat\r\nin his eyes. She doubtless wished to assert her dignity; he was young,\r\nand she would be great in his eyes; for the lover who had forsaken her\r\nhad held her so cheap that she was determined that Eugene should not\r\nthink her an easy conquest, and for this very reason--he knew that\r\nde Marsay had been his predecessor. Finally, after the degradation of\r\nsubmission to the pleasure of a heartless young rake, it was so sweet\r\nto her to wander in the flower-strewn realms of love, that it was not\r\nwonderful that she should wish to dwell a while on the prospect, to\r\ntremble with the vibrations of love, to feel the freshness of the breath\r\nof its dawn. The true lover was suffering for the sins of the false.\r\nThis inconsistency is unfortunately only to be expected so long as men\r\ndo not know how many flowers are mown down in a young woman’s soul by\r\nthe first stroke of treachery.\r\n\r\nWhatever her reasons may have been, Delphine was playing with Rastignac,\r\nand took pleasure in playing with him, doubtless because she felt sure\r\nof his love, and confident that she could put an end to the torture\r\nas soon as it was her royal pleasure to do so. Eugene’s self-love was\r\nengaged; he could not suffer his first passage of love to end in a\r\ndefeat, and persisted in his suit like a sportsman determined to\r\nbring down at least one partridge to celebrate his first Feast of\r\nSaint-Hubert. The pressure of anxiety, his wounded self-love, his\r\ndespair, real or feigned, drew him nearer and nearer to this woman. All\r\nParis credited him with this conquest, and yet he was conscious that he\r\nhad made no progress since the day when he saw Mme. de Nucingen for the\r\nfirst time. He did not know as yet that a woman’s coquetry is sometimes\r\nmore delightful than the pleasure of secure possession of her love, and\r\nwas possessed with helpless rage. If, at this time, while she denied\r\nherself to love, Eugene gathered the springtide spoils of his life,\r\nthe fruit, somewhat sharp and green, and dearly bought, was no less\r\ndelicious to the taste. There were moments when he had not a sou in\r\nhis pockets, and at such times he thought in spite of his conscience of\r\nVautrin’s offer and the possibility of fortune by a marriage with Mlle.\r\nTaillefer. Poverty would clamor so loudly that more than once he was on\r\nthe point of yielding to the cunning temptations of the terrible sphinx,\r\nwhose glance had so often exerted a strange spell over him.\r\n\r\nPoiret and Mlle. Michonneau went up to their rooms; and Rastignac,\r\nthinking that he was alone with the women in the dining-room, sat\r\nbetween Mme. Vauquer and Mme. Couture, who was nodding over the woolen\r\ncuffs that she was knitting by the stove, and looked at Mlle. Taillefer\r\nso tenderly that she lowered her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Can you be in trouble, M. Eugene?” Victorine said after a pause.\r\n\r\n“Who has not his troubles?” answered Rastignac. “If we men were sure\r\nof being loved, sure of a devotion which would be our reward for the\r\nsacrifices which we are always ready to make, then perhaps we should\r\nhave no troubles.”\r\n\r\nFor answer Mlle. Taillefer only gave him a glance but it was impossible\r\nto mistake its meaning.\r\n\r\n“You, for instance, mademoiselle; you feel sure of your heart to-day,\r\nbut are you sure that it will never change?”\r\n\r\nA smile flitted over the poor girl’s lips; it seemed as if a ray of\r\nlight from her soul had lighted up her face. Eugene was dismayed at the\r\nsudden explosion of feeling caused by his words.\r\n\r\n“Ah! but suppose,” he said, “that you should be rich and happy\r\nto-morrow, suppose that a vast fortune dropped down from the clouds\r\nfor you, would you still love the man whom you loved in your days of\r\npoverty?”\r\n\r\nA charming movement of the head was her only answer.\r\n\r\n“Even if he were very poor?”\r\n\r\nAgain the same mute answer.\r\n\r\n“What nonsense are you talking, you two?” exclaimed Mme. Vauquer.\r\n\r\n“Never mind,” answered Eugene; “we understand each other.”\r\n\r\n“So there is to be an engagement of marriage between M. le Chevalier\r\nEugene de Rastignac and Mlle. Victorine Taillefer, is there?” The words\r\nwere uttered in Vautrin’s deep voice, and Vautrin appeared at the door\r\nas he spoke.\r\n\r\n“Oh! how you startled me!” Mme. Couture and Mme. Vauquer exclaimed\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n“I might make a worse choice,” said Rastignac, laughing. Vautrin’s voice\r\nhad thrown him into the most painful agitation that he had yet known.\r\n\r\n“No bad jokes, gentlemen!” said Mme. Couture. “My dear, let us go\r\nupstairs.”\r\n\r\nMme. Vauquer followed the two ladies, meaning to pass the evening in\r\ntheir room, an arrangement that economized fire and candlelight. Eugene\r\nand Vautrin were left alone.\r\n\r\n“I felt sure you would come round to it,” said the elder man with the\r\ncoolness that nothing seemed to shake. “But stay a moment! I have as\r\nmuch delicacy as anybody else. Don’t make up your mind on the spur of\r\nthe moment; you are a little thrown off your balance just now. You are\r\nin debt, and I want you to come over to my way of thinking after sober\r\nreflection, and not in a fit of passion or desperation. Perhaps you want\r\na thousand crowns. There, you can have them if you like.”\r\n\r\nThe tempter took out a pocketbook, and drew thence three banknotes,\r\nwhich he fluttered before the student’s eyes. Eugene was in a most\r\npainful dilemma. He had debts, debts of honor. He owed a hundred louis\r\nto the Marquis d’Ajuda and to the Count de Trailles; he had not the\r\nmoney, and for this reason had not dared to go to Mme. de Restaud’s\r\nhouse, where he was expected that evening. It was one of those informal\r\ngatherings where tea and little cakes are handed round, but where it is\r\npossible to lose six thousand francs at whist in the course of a night.\r\n\r\n“You must see,” said Eugene, struggling to hide a convulsive tremor,\r\n“that after what has passed between us, I cannot possibly lay myself\r\nunder any obligation to you.”\r\n\r\n“Quite right; I should be sorry to hear you speak otherwise,” answered\r\nthe tempter. “You are a fine young fellow, honorable, brave as a lion,\r\nand as gentle as a young girl. You would be a fine haul for the devil! I\r\nlike youngsters of your sort. Get rid of one or two more prejudices, and\r\nyou will see the world as it is. Make a little scene now and then, and\r\nact a virtuous part in it, and a man with a head on his shoulders can\r\ndo exactly as he likes amid deafening applause from the fools in the\r\ngallery. Ah! a few days yet, and you will be with us; and if you would\r\nonly be tutored by me, I would put you in the way of achieving all your\r\nambitions. You should no sooner form a wish than it should be realized\r\nto the full; you should have all your desires--honors, wealth, or women.\r\nCivilization should flow with milk and honey for you. You should be our\r\npet and favorite, our Benjamin. We would all work ourselves to death for\r\nyou with pleasure; every obstacle should be removed from your path. You\r\nhave a few prejudices left; so you think that I am a scoundrel, do you?\r\nWell, M. de Turenne, quite as honorable a man as you take yourself to\r\nbe, had some little private transactions with bandits, and did not\r\nfeel that his honor was tarnished. You would rather not lie under any\r\nobligation to me, eh? You need not draw back on that account,” Vautrin\r\nwent on, and a smile stole over his lips. “Take these bits of paper\r\nand write across this,” he added, producing a piece of stamped paper,\r\n“_Accepted the sum of three thousand five hundred francs due this day\r\ntwelvemonth_, and fill in the date. The rate of interest is stiff enough\r\nto silence any scruples on your part; it gives you the right to call me\r\na Jew. You can call quits with me on the score of gratitude. I am quite\r\nwilling that you should despise me to-day, because I am sure that you\r\nwill have a kindlier feeling towards me later on. You will find out\r\nfathomless depths in my nature, enormous and concentrated forces that\r\nweaklings call vices, but you will never find me base or ungrateful.\r\nIn short, I am neither a pawn nor a bishop, but a castle, a tower of\r\nstrength, my boy.”\r\n\r\n“What manner of man are you?” cried Eugene. “Were you created to torment\r\nme?”\r\n\r\n“Why no; I am a good-natured fellow, who is willing to do a dirty piece\r\nof work to put you high and dry above the mire for the rest of your\r\ndays. Do you ask the reason of this devotion? All right; I will tell you\r\nthat some of these days. A word or two in your ear will explain it. I\r\nhave begun by shocking you, by showing you the way to ring the changes,\r\nand giving you a sight of the mechanism of the social machine; but your\r\nfirst fright will go off like a conscript’s terror on the battlefield.\r\nYou will grow used to regarding men as common soldiers who have made up\r\ntheir minds to lose their lives for some self-constituted king. Times\r\nhave altered strangely. Once you could say to a bravo, ‘Here are a\r\nhundred crowns; go and kill Monsieur So-and-so for me,’ and you could\r\nsup quietly after turning some one off into the dark for the least thing\r\nin the world. But nowadays I propose to put you in the way of a handsome\r\nfortune; you have only to nod your head, it won’t compromise you in any\r\nway, and you hesitate. ‘Tis an effeminate age.”\r\n\r\nEugene accepted the draft, and received the banknotes in exchange for\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“Well, well. Come, now, let us talk rationally,” Vautrin continued. “I\r\nmean to leave this country in a few months’ time for America, and set\r\nabout planting tobacco. I will send you the cigars of friendship. If\r\nI make money at it, I will help you in your career. If I have no\r\nchildren--which will probably be the case, for I have no anxiety to\r\nraise slips of myself here--you shall inherit my fortune. That is what\r\nyou may call standing by a man; but I myself have a liking for you. I\r\nhave a mania, too, for devoting myself to some one else. I have done it\r\nbefore. You see, my boy, I live in a loftier sphere than other men do;\r\nI look on all actions as means to an end, and the end is all that I look\r\nat. What is a man’s life to me? Not _that_,” he said, and he snapped his\r\nthumb-nail against his teeth. “A man, in short, is everything to me, or\r\njust nothing at all. Less than nothing if his name happens to be Poiret;\r\nyou can crush him like a bug, he is flat and he is offensive. But a man\r\nis a god when he is like you; he is not a machine covered with a skin,\r\nbut a theatre in which the greatest sentiments are displayed--great\r\nthoughts and feelings--and for these, and these only, I live. A\r\nsentiment--what is that but the whole world in a thought? Look at Father\r\nGoriot. For him, his two girls are the whole universe; they are the clue\r\nby which he finds his way through creation. Well, for my own part,\r\nI have fathomed the depths of life, there is only one real\r\nsentiment--comradeship between man and man. Pierre and Jaffier, that is\r\nmy passion. I knew _Venice Preserved_ by heart. Have you met many men\r\nplucky enough when a comrade says, ‘Let us bury a dead body!’ to go and\r\ndo it without a word or plaguing him by taking a high moral tone? I have\r\ndone it myself. I should not talk like this to just everybody, but you\r\nare not like an ordinary man; one can talk to you, you can understand\r\nthings. You will not dabble about much longer among the tadpoles in\r\nthese swamps. Well, then, it is all settled. You will marry. Both of us\r\ncarry our point. Mine is made of iron, and will never soften, he! he!”\r\n\r\nVautrin went out. He would not wait to hear the student’s repudiation,\r\nhe wished to put Eugene at his ease. He seemed to understand the secret\r\nsprings of the faint resistance still made by the younger man; the\r\nstruggles in which men seek to preserve their self-respect by justifying\r\ntheir blameworthy actions to themselves.\r\n\r\n“He may do as he likes; I shall not marry Mlle. Taillefer, that is\r\ncertain,” said Eugene to himself.\r\n\r\nHe regarded this man with abhorrence, and yet the very cynicism of\r\nVautrin’s ideas, and the audacious way in which he used other men for\r\nhis own ends, raised him in the student’s eyes; but the thought of a\r\ncompact threw Eugene into a fever of apprehension, and not until he\r\nhad recovered somewhat did he dress, call for a cab, and go to Mme. de\r\nRestaud’s.\r\n\r\nFor some days the Countess had paid more and more attention to a young\r\nman whose every step seemed a triumphal progress in the great world; it\r\nseemed to her that he might be a formidable power before long. He paid\r\nMessieurs de Trailles and d’Ajuda, played at whist for part of the\r\nevening, and made good his losses. Most men who have their way to make\r\nare more or less of fatalists, and Eugene was superstitious; he chose to\r\nconsider that his luck was heaven’s reward for his perseverance in the\r\nright way. As soon as possible on the following morning he asked Vautrin\r\nwhether the bill he had given was still in the other’s possession; and\r\non receiving a reply in the affirmative, he repaid the three thousand\r\nfrancs with a not unnatural relief.\r\n\r\n“Everything is going on well,” said Vautrin.\r\n\r\n“But I am not your accomplice,” said Eugene.\r\n\r\n“I know, I know,” Vautrin broke in. “You are still acting like a child.\r\nYou are making mountains out of molehills at the outset.”\r\n\r\nTwo days later, Poiret and Mlle. Michonneau were sitting together on\r\na bench in the sun. They had chosen a little frequented alley in the\r\nJardin des Plantes, and a gentleman was chatting with them, the same\r\nperson, as a matter of fact, about whom the medical student had, not\r\nwithout good reason, his own suspicions.\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle,” this M. Gondureau was saying, “I do not see any\r\ncause for your scruples. His Excellency, Monseigneur the Minister of\r\nPolice----”\r\n\r\n“Yes, his Excellency is taking a personal interest in the matter,” said\r\nGondureau.\r\n\r\nWho would think it probable that Poiret, a retired clerk, doubtless\r\npossessed of some notions of civic virtue, though there might be nothing\r\nelse in his head--who would think it likely that such a man would\r\ncontinue to lend an ear to this supposed independent gentleman of the\r\nRue de Buffon, when the latter dropped the mask of a decent citizen by\r\nthat word “police,” and gave a glimpse of the features of a detective\r\nfrom the Rue de Jerusalem? And yet nothing was more natural. Perhaps the\r\nfollowing remarks from the hitherto unpublished records made by certain\r\nobservers will throw a light on the particular species to which Poiret\r\nbelonged in the great family of fools. There is a race of quill-drivers,\r\nconfined in the columns of the budget between the first degree of\r\nlatitude (a kind of administrative Greenland where the salaries begin at\r\ntwelve hundred francs) to the third degree, a more temperate zone, where\r\nincomes grow from three to six thousand francs, a climate where\r\nthe _bonus_ flourishes like a half-hardy annual in spite of some\r\ndifficulties of culture. A characteristic trait that best reveals the\r\nfeeble narrow-mindedness of these inhabitants of petty officialdom is a\r\nkind of involuntary, mechanical, and instinctive reverence for the Grand\r\nLama of every Ministry, known to the rank and file only by his signature\r\n(an illegible scrawl) and by his title--“His Excellency Monseigneur\r\nle Ministre,” five words which produce as much effect as the _il Bondo\r\nCani_ of the _Calife de Bagdad_, five words which in the eyes of this\r\nlow order of intelligence represent a sacred power from which there is\r\nno appeal. The Minister is administratively infallible for the clerks\r\nin the employ of the Government, as the Pope is infallible for good\r\nCatholics. Something of this peculiar radiance invests everything he\r\ndoes or says, or that is said or done in his name; the robe of office\r\ncovers everything and legalizes everything done by his orders; does not\r\nhis very title--His Excellency--vouch for the purity of his intentions\r\nand the righteousness of his will, and serve as a sort of passport and\r\nintroduction to ideas that otherwise would not be entertained for a\r\nmoment? Pronounce the words “His Excellency,” and these poor folk will\r\nforthwith proceed to do what they would not do for their own interests.\r\nPassive obedience is as well known in a Government department as in\r\nthe army itself; and the administrative system silences consciences,\r\nannihilates the individual, and ends (give it time enough) by fashioning\r\na man into a vise or a thumbscrew, and he becomes part of the machinery\r\nof Government. Wherefore, M. Gondureau, who seemed to know something\r\nof human nature, recognized Poiret at once as one of those dupes of\r\nofficialdom, and brought out for his benefit, at the proper moment, the\r\n_deus ex machina_, the magical words “His Excellency,” so as to dazzle\r\nPoiret just as he himself unmasked his batteries, for he took Poiret and\r\nthe Michonneau for the male and female of the same species.\r\n\r\n“If his Excellency himself, his Excellency the Minister... Ah! that is\r\nquite another thing,” said Poiret.\r\n\r\n“You seem to be guided by this gentleman’s opinion, and you hear what he\r\nsays,” said the man of independent means, addressing Mlle. Michonneau.\r\n“Very well, his Excellency is at this moment absolutely certain that the\r\nso-called Vautrin, who lodges at the Maison Vauquer, is a convict\r\nwho escaped from penal servitude at Toulon, where he is known by the\r\nnickname _Trompe-la-Mort_.”\r\n\r\n“Trompe-la-Mort?” said Pioret. “Dear me, he is very lucky if he deserves\r\nthat nickname.”\r\n\r\n“Well, yes,” said the detective. “They call him so because he has been\r\nso lucky as not to lose his life in the very risky businesses that he\r\nhas carried through. He is a dangerous man, you see! He has qualities\r\nthat are out of the common; the thing he is wanted for, in fact, was a\r\nmatter which gained him no end of credit with his own set----”\r\n\r\n“Then is he a man of honor?” asked Poiret.\r\n\r\n“Yes, according to his notions. He agreed to take another man’s crime\r\nupon himself--a forgery committed by a very handsome young fellow that\r\nhe had taken a great fancy to, a young Italian, a bit of a gambler,\r\nwho has since gone into the army, where his conduct has been\r\nunexceptionable.”\r\n\r\n“But if his Excellency the Minister of Police is certain that M.\r\nVautrin is this _Trompe-la-Mort_, why should he want me?” asked Mlle.\r\nMichonneau.\r\n\r\n“Oh yes,” said Poiret, “if the Minister, as you have been so obliging as\r\nto tell us, really knows for a certainty----”\r\n\r\n“Certainty is not the word; he only suspects. You will soon understand\r\nhow things are. Jacques Collin, nicknamed _Trompe-la-Mort_, is in the\r\nconfidence of every convict in the three prisons; he is their man of\r\nbusiness and their banker. He makes a very good thing out of managing\r\ntheir affairs, which want a _man of mark_ to see about them.”\r\n\r\n“Ha! ha! do you see the pun, mademoiselle?” asked Poiret. “This\r\ngentleman calls himself a _man of mark_ because he is a _marked\r\nman_--branded, you know.”\r\n\r\n“This so-called Vautrin,” said the detective, “receives the money\r\nbelonging to my lords the convicts, invests it for them, and holds it at\r\nthe disposal of those who escape, or hands it over to their families if\r\nthey leave a will, or to their mistresses when they draw upon him for\r\ntheir benefit.”\r\n\r\n“Their mistresses! You mean their wives,” remarked Poiret.\r\n\r\n“No, sir. A convict’s wife is usually an illegitimate connection. We\r\ncall them concubines.”\r\n\r\n“Then they all live in a state of concubinage?”\r\n\r\n“Naturally.”\r\n\r\n“Why, these are abominations that his Excellency ought not to allow.\r\nSince you have the honor of seeing his Excellency, you, who seem to have\r\nphilanthropic ideas, ought really to enlighten him as to their immoral\r\nconduct--they are setting a shocking example to the rest of society.”\r\n\r\n“But the Government does not hold them up as models of all the virtues,\r\nmy dear sir----”\r\n\r\n“Of course not, sir; but still----”\r\n\r\n“Just let the gentleman say what he has to say, dearie,” said Mlle.\r\nMichonneau.\r\n\r\n“You see how it is, mademoiselle,” Gondureau continued. “The Government\r\nmay have the strongest reasons for getting this illicit hoard into its\r\nhands; it mounts up to something considerable, by all that we can\r\nmake out. Trompe-la-Mort not only holds large sums for his friends the\r\nconvicts, but he has other amounts which are paid over to him by the\r\nSociety of the Ten Thousand----”\r\n\r\n“Ten Thousand Thieves!” cried Pioret in alarm.\r\n\r\n“No. The Society of the Ten Thousand is not an association of petty\r\noffenders, but of people who set about their work on a large scale--they\r\nwon’t touch a matter unless there are ten thousand francs in it. It is\r\ncomposed of the most distinguished of the men who are sent straight to\r\nthe Assize Courts when they come up for trial. They know the Code\r\ntoo well to risk their necks when they are nabbed. Collin is their\r\nconfidential agent and legal adviser. By means of the large sums of\r\nmoney at his disposal he has established a sort of detective system of\r\nhis own; it is widespread and mysterious in its workings. We have had\r\nspies all about him for a twelvemonth, and yet we could not manage to\r\nfathom his games. His capital and his cleverness are at the service of\r\nvice and crime; this money furnishes the necessary funds for a regular\r\narmy of blackguards in his pay who wage incessant war against society.\r\nIf we can catch Trompe-la-Mort, and take possession of his funds,\r\nwe should strike at the root of this evil. So this job is a kind of\r\nGovernment affair--a State secret--and likely to redound to the honor\r\nof those who bring the thing to a successful conclusion. You, sir, for\r\ninstance, might very well be taken into a Government department again;\r\nthey might make you secretary to a Commissary of Police; you could\r\naccept that post without prejudice to your retiring pension.”\r\n\r\nMlle. Michonneau interposed at this point with, “What is there to hinder\r\nTrompe-la-Mort from making off with the money?”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said the detective, “a man is told off to follow him everywhere he\r\ngoes, with orders to kill him if he were to rob the convicts. Then it is\r\nnot quite as easy to make off with a lot of money as it is to run away\r\nwith a young lady of family. Besides, Collin is not the sort of fellow\r\nto play such a trick; he would be disgraced, according to his notions.”\r\n\r\n“You are quite right, sir,” said Poiret, “utterly disgraced he would\r\nbe.”\r\n\r\n“But none of all this explains why you do not come and take him without\r\nmore ado,” remarked Mlle. Michonneau.\r\n\r\n“Very well, mademoiselle, I will explain--but,” he added in her ear,\r\n“keep your companion quiet, or I shall never have done. The old boy\r\nought to pay people handsomely for listening to him.--Trompe-la-Mort,\r\nwhen he came back here,” he went on aloud “slipped into the skin of an\r\nhonest man; he turned up disguised as a decent Parisian citizen, and\r\ntook up his quarters in an unpretending lodging-house. He is cunning,\r\nthat he is! You don’t catch him napping. Then M. Vautrin is a man of\r\nconsequence, who transacts a good deal of business.”\r\n\r\n“Naturally,” said Poiret to himself.\r\n\r\n“And suppose that the Minister were to make a mistake and get hold of\r\nthe real Vautrin, he would put every one’s back up among the business\r\nmen in Paris, and public opinion would be against him. M. le Prefet de\r\nPolice is on slippery ground; he has enemies. They would take advantage\r\nof any mistake. There would be a fine outcry and fuss made by the\r\nOpposition, and he would be sent packing. We must set about this just as\r\nwe did about the Coignard affair, the sham Comte de Sainte-Helene; if\r\nhe had been the real Comte de Sainte-Helene, we should have been in the\r\nwrong box. We want to be quite sure what we are about.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but what you want is a pretty woman,” said Mlle. Michonneau\r\nbriskly.\r\n\r\n“Trompe-la-Mort would not let a woman come near him,” said the\r\ndetective. “I will tell you a secret--he does not like them.”\r\n\r\n“Still, I do not see what I can do, supposing that I did agree to\r\nidentify him for two thousand francs.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing simpler,” said the stranger. “I will send you a little bottle\r\ncontaining a dose that will send a rush of blood to the head; it will do\r\nhim no harm whatever, but he will fall down as if he were in a fit. The\r\ndrug can be put into wine or coffee; either will do equally well. You\r\ncarry your man to bed at once, and undress him to see that he is not\r\ndying. As soon as you are alone, you give him a slap on the shoulder,\r\nand _presto!_ the letters will appear.”\r\n\r\n“Why, that is just nothing at all,” said Poiret.\r\n\r\n“Well, do you agree?” said Gondureau, addressing the old maid.\r\n\r\n“But, my dear sir, suppose there are no letters at all,” said Mlle.\r\nMichonneau; “am I to have the two thousand francs all the same?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“What will you give me then?”\r\n\r\n“Five hundred francs.”\r\n\r\n“It is such a thing to do for so little! It lies on your conscience just\r\nthe same, and I must quiet my conscience, sir.”\r\n\r\n“I assure you,” said Poiret, “that mademoiselle has a great deal of\r\nconscience, and not only so, she is a very amiable person, and very\r\nintelligent.”\r\n\r\n“Well, now,” Mlle. Michonneau went on, “make it three thousand francs if\r\nhe is Trompe-la-Mort, and nothing at all if he is an ordinary man.”\r\n\r\n“Done!” said Gondureau, “but on the condition that the thing is settled\r\nto-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“Not quite so soon, my dear sir; I must consult my confessor first.”\r\n\r\n“You are a sly one,” said the detective as he rose to his feet.\r\n“Good-bye till to-morrow, then. And if you should want to see me in a\r\nhurry, go to the Petite Rue Saint-Anne at the bottom of the Cour de la\r\nSainte-Chapelle. There is one door under the archway. Ask there for M.\r\nGondureau.”\r\n\r\nBianchon, on his way back from Cuvier’s lecture, overheard the\r\nsufficiently striking nickname of _Trompe-la-Mort_, and caught the\r\ncelebrated chief detective’s “_Done!_”\r\n\r\n“Why didn’t you close with him? It would be three hundred francs a\r\nyear,” said Poiret to Mlle. Michonneau.\r\n\r\n“Why didn’t I?” she asked. “Why, it wants thinking over. Suppose that M.\r\nVautrin is this Trompe-la-Mort, perhaps we might do better for ourselves\r\nwith him. Still, on the other hand, if you ask him for money, it would\r\nput him on his guard, and he is just the man to clear out without\r\npaying, and that would be an abominable sell.”\r\n\r\n“And suppose you did warn him,” Poiret went on, “didn’t that gentleman\r\nsay that he was closely watched? You would spoil everything.”\r\n\r\n“Anyhow,” thought Mlle. Michonneau, “I can’t abide him. He says nothing\r\nbut disagreeable things to me.”\r\n\r\n“But you can do better than that,” Poiret resumed. “As that gentleman\r\nsaid (and he seemed to me to be a very good sort of man, besides being\r\nvery well got up), it is an act of obedience to the laws to rid society\r\nof a criminal, however virtuous he may be. Once a thief, always a thief.\r\nSuppose he were to take it into his head to murder us all? The deuce! We\r\nshould be guilty of manslaughter, and be the first to fall victims into\r\nthe bargain!”\r\n\r\nMlle. Michonneau’s musings did not permit her to listen very closely to\r\nthe remarks that fell one by one from Poiret’s lips like water dripping\r\nfrom a leaky tap. When once this elderly babbler began to talk, he would\r\ngo on like clockwork unless Mlle. Michonneau stopped him. He started\r\non some subject or other, and wandered on through parenthesis after\r\nparenthesis, till he came to regions as remote as possible from his\r\npremises without coming to any conclusions by the way.\r\n\r\nBy the time they reached the Maison Vauquer he had tacked together a\r\nwhole string of examples and quotations more or less irrelevant to\r\nthe subject in hand, which led him to give a full account of his own\r\ndeposition in the case of the Sieur Ragoulleau _versus_ Dame Morin, when\r\nhe had been summoned as a witness for the defence.\r\n\r\nAs they entered the dining-room, Eugene de Rastignac was talking apart\r\nwith Mlle. Taillefer; the conversation appeared to be of such thrilling\r\ninterest that the pair never noticed the two older lodgers as they\r\npassed through the room. None of this was thrown away on Mlle.\r\nMichonneau.\r\n\r\n“I knew how it would end,” remarked that lady, addressing Poiret. “They\r\nhave been making eyes at each other in a heartrending way for a week\r\npast.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he answered. “So she was found guilty.”\r\n\r\n“Who?”\r\n\r\n“Mme. Morin.”\r\n\r\n“I am talking about Mlle. Victorine,” said Mlle, Michonneau, as she\r\nentered Poiret’s room with an absent air, “and you answer, ‘Mme. Morin.’\r\nWho may Mme. Morin be?”\r\n\r\n“What can Mlle. Victorine be guilty of?” demanded Poiret.\r\n\r\n“Guilty of falling in love with M. Eugene de Rastignac and going further\r\nand further without knowing exactly where she is going, poor innocent!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat morning Mme. de Nucingen had driven Eugene to despair. In his own\r\nmind he had completely surrendered himself to Vautrin, and deliberately\r\nshut his eyes to the motive for the friendship which that extraordinary\r\nman professed for him, nor would he look to the consequences of such an\r\nalliance. Nothing short of a miracle could extricate him now out of the\r\ngulf into which he had walked an hour ago, when he exchanged vows in the\r\nsoftest whispers with Mlle. Taillefer. To Victorine it seemed as if she\r\nheard an angel’s voice, that heaven was opening above her; the Maison\r\nVauquer took strange and wonderful hues, like a stage fairy-palace. She\r\nloved and she was loved; at any rate, she believed that she was loved;\r\nand what woman would not likewise have believed after seeing Rastignac’s\r\nface and listening to the tones of his voice during that hour snatched\r\nunder the Argus eyes of the Maison Vauquer? He had trampled on his\r\nconscience; he knew that he was doing wrong, and did it deliberately;\r\nhe had said to himself that a woman’s happiness should atone for this\r\nvenial sin. The energy of desperation had lent new beauty to his face;\r\nthe lurid fire that burned in his heart shone from his eyes. Luckily\r\nfor him, the miracle took place. Vautrin came in in high spirits, and\r\nat once read the hearts of these two young creatures whom he had brought\r\ntogether by the combinations of his infernal genius, but his deep voice\r\nbroke in upon their bliss.\r\n\r\n     “A charming girl is my Fanchette\r\n      In her simplicity,”\r\n\r\nhe sang mockingly.\r\n\r\nVictorine fled. Her heart was more full than it had ever been, but it\r\nwas full of joy, and not of sorrow. Poor child! A pressure of the hand,\r\nthe light touch of Rastignac’s hair against her cheek, a word whispered\r\nin her ear so closely that she felt the student’s warm breath on\r\nher, the pressure of a trembling arm about her waist, a kiss upon her\r\nthroat--such had been her betrothal. The near neighborhood of the stout\r\nSylvie, who might invade that glorified room at any moment, only made\r\nthese first tokens of love more ardent, more eloquent, more entrancing\r\nthan the noblest deeds done for love’s sake in the most famous\r\nromances. This _plain-song_ of love, to use the pretty expression of our\r\nforefathers, seemed almost criminal to the devout young girl who went to\r\nconfession every fortnight. In that one hour she had poured out more of\r\nthe treasures of her soul than she could give in later days of wealth\r\nand happiness, when her whole self followed the gift.\r\n\r\n“The thing is arranged,” Vautrin said to Eugene, who remained. “Our two\r\ndandies have fallen out. Everything was done in proper form. It is\r\na matter of opinion. Our pigeon has insulted my hawk. They will meet\r\nto-morrow in the redoubt at Clignancourt. By half-past eight in the\r\nmorning Mlle. Taillefer, calmly dipping her bread and butter in her\r\ncoffee cup, will be sole heiress of her father’s fortune and affections.\r\nA funny way of putting it, isn’t it? Taillefer’s youngster is an expert\r\nswordsman, and quite cocksure about it, but he will be bled; I have just\r\ninvented a thrust for his benefit, a way of raising your sword point\r\nand driving it at the forehead. I must show you that thrust; it is an\r\nuncommonly handy thing to know.”\r\n\r\nRastignac heard him in dazed bewilderment; he could not find a word in\r\nreply. Just then Goriot came in, and Bianchon and a few of the boarders\r\nlikewise appeared.\r\n\r\n“That is just as I intended.” Vautrin said. “You know quite well what\r\nyou are about. Good, my little eaglet! You are born to command, you are\r\nstrong, you stand firm on your feet, you are game! I respect you.”\r\n\r\nHe made as though he would take Eugene’s hand, but Rastignac hastily\r\nwithdrew it, sank into a chair, and turned ghastly pale; it seemed to\r\nhim that there was a sea of blood before his eyes.\r\n\r\n“Oh! so we still have a few dubious tatters of the swaddling clothes\r\nof virtue about us!” murmured Vautrin. “But Papa Doliban has three\r\nmillions; I know the amount of his fortune. Once have her dowry in your\r\nhands, and your character will be as white as the bride’s white dress,\r\neven in your own eyes.”\r\n\r\nRastignac hesitated no longer. He made up his mind that he would go that\r\nevening to warn the Taillefers, father and son. But just as Vautrin left\r\nhim, Father Goriot came up and said in his ear, “You look melancholy, my\r\nboy; I will cheer you up. Come with me.”\r\n\r\nThe old vermicelli dealer lighted his dip at one of the lamps as he\r\nspoke. Eugene went with him, his curiosity had been aroused.\r\n\r\n“Let us go up to your room,” the worthy soul remarked, when he had\r\nasked Sylvie for the law student’s key. “This morning,” he resumed, “you\r\nthought that _she_ did not care about you, did you not? Eh? She would\r\nhave nothing to say to you, and you went away out of humor and out of\r\nheart. Stuff and rubbish! She wanted you to go because she was expecting\r\n_me_! Now do you understand? We were to complete the arrangements for\r\ntaking some chambers for you, a jewel of a place, you are to move\r\ninto it in three days’ time. Don’t split upon me. She wants it to be a\r\nsurprise; but I couldn’t bear to keep the secret from you. You will be\r\nin the Rue d’Artois, only a step or two from the Rue Saint-Lazare, and\r\nyou are to be housed like a prince! Any one might have thought we were\r\nfurnishing the house for a bride. Oh! we have done a lot of things in\r\nthe last month, and you knew nothing about it. My attorney has appeared\r\non the scene, and my daughter is to have thirty-six thousand francs a\r\nyear, the interest on her money, and I shall insist on having her eight\r\nhundred thousand invested in sound securities, landed property that\r\nwon’t run away.”\r\n\r\nEugene was dumb. He folded his arms and paced up and down in his\r\ncheerless, untidy room. Father Goriot waited till the student’s back was\r\nturned, and seized the opportunity to go to the chimney-piece and set\r\nupon it a little red morocco case with Rastignac’s arms stamped in gold\r\non the leather.\r\n\r\n“My dear boy,” said the kind soul, “I have been up to the eyes in this\r\nbusiness. You see, there was plenty of selfishness on my part; I have an\r\ninterested motive in helping you to change lodgings. You will not refuse\r\nme if I ask you something; will you, eh?”\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“There is a room on the fifth floor, up above your rooms, that is to let\r\nalong with them; that is where I am going to live, isn’t that so? I am\r\ngetting old: I am too far from my girls. I shall not be in the way, but\r\nI shall be there, that is all. You will come and talk to me about her\r\nevery evening. It will not put you about, will it? I shall have gone to\r\nbed before you come in, but I shall hear you come up, and I shall say\r\nto myself, ‘He has just seen my little Delphine. He has been to a dance\r\nwith her, and she is happy, thanks to him.’ If I were ill, it would do\r\nmy heart good to hear you moving about below, to know when you leave\r\nthe house and when you come in. It is only a step to the Champs-Elysees,\r\nwhere they go every day, so I shall be sure of seeing them, whereas now\r\nI am sometimes too late. And then--perhaps she may come to see you! I\r\nshall hear her, I shall see her in her soft quilted pelisse tripping\r\nabout as daintily as a kitten. In this one month she has become my\r\nlittle girl again, so light-hearted and gay. Her soul is recovering, and\r\nher happiness is owing to you! Oh! I would do impossibilities for you.\r\nOnly just now she said to me, ‘I am very happy, papa!’ When they say\r\n‘father’ stiffly, it sends a chill through me; but when they call me\r\n‘papa,’ it brings all the old memories back. I feel most their father\r\nthen; I even believe that they belong to me, and to no one else.”\r\n\r\nThe good man wiped his eyes, he was crying.\r\n\r\n“It is a long while since I have heard them talk like that, a long, long\r\ntime since she took my arm as she did to-day. Yes, indeed, it must be\r\nquite ten years since I walked side by side with one of my girls. How\r\npleasant it was to keep step with her, to feel the touch of her gown,\r\nthe warmth of her arm! Well, I took Delphine everywhere this morning; I\r\nwent shopping with her, and I brought her home again. Oh! you must let\r\nme live near you. You may want some one to do you a service some of\r\nthese days, and I shall be on the spot to do it. Oh! if only that great\r\ndolt of an Alsatian would die, if his gout would have the sense to\r\nattack his stomach, how happy my poor child would be! You would be my\r\nson-in-law; you would be her husband in the eyes of the world. Bah! she\r\nhas known no happiness, that excuses everything. Our Father in heaven is\r\nsurely on the side of fathers on earth who love their children. How fond\r\nof you she is!” he said, raising his head after a pause. “All the time\r\nwe were going about together she chatted away about you. ‘He is so\r\nnice-looking, papa; isn’t he? He is kind-hearted! Does he talk to you\r\nabout me?’ Pshaw! she said enough about you to fill whole volumes;\r\nbetween the Rue d’Artois and the Passage des Panoramas she poured her\r\nheart out into mine. I did not feel old once during that delightful\r\nmorning; I felt as light as a feather. I told her how you had given the\r\nbanknote to me; it moved my darling to tears. But what can this be on\r\nyour chimney-piece?” said Father Goriot at last. Rastignac had showed no\r\nsign, and he was dying of impatience.\r\n\r\nEugene stared at his neighbor in dumb and dazed bewilderment. He thought\r\nof Vautrin, of that duel to be fought to-morrow morning, and of this\r\nrealization of his dearest hopes, and the violent contrast between the\r\ntwo sets of ideas gave him all the sensations of nightmare. He went to\r\nthe chimney-piece, saw the little square case, opened it, and found\r\na watch of Breguet’s make wrapped in paper, on which these words were\r\nwritten:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “I want you to think of me every hour, _because_...\r\n\r\n                                          “DELPHINE.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThat last word doubtless contained an allusion to some scene that\r\nhad taken place between them. Eugene felt touched. Inside the gold\r\nwatch-case his arms had been wrought in enamel. The chain, the key, the\r\nworkmanship and design of the trinket were all such as he had imagined,\r\nfor he had long coveted such a possession. Father Goriot was radiant. Of\r\ncourse he had promised to tell his daughter every little detail of the\r\nscene and of the effect produced upon Eugene by her present; he shared\r\nin the pleasure and excitement of the young people, and seemed to be not\r\nthe least happy of the three. He loved Rastignac already for his own as\r\nwell as for his daughter’s sake.\r\n\r\n“You must go and see her; she is expecting you this evening. That great\r\nlout of an Alsatian is going to have supper with his opera-dancer. Aha!\r\nhe looked very foolish when my attorney let him know where he was. He\r\nsays he idolizes my daughter, does he? He had better let her alone, or I\r\nwill kill him. To think that my Delphine is his”--he heaved a sigh--“it\r\nis enough to make me murder him, but it would not be manslaughter to\r\nkill that animal; he is a pig with a calf’s brains.--You will take me\r\nwith you, will you not?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, dear Father Goriot; you know very well how fond I am of you----”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do know very well. You are not ashamed of me, are you? Not you!\r\nLet me embrace you,” and he flung his arms around the student’s neck.\r\n\r\n“You will make her very happy; promise me that you will! You will go to\r\nher this evening, will you not?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! yes. I must go out; I have some urgent business on hand.”\r\n\r\n“Can I be of any use?”\r\n\r\n“My word, yes! Will you go to old Taillefer’s while I go to Mme. de\r\nNucingen? Ask him to make an appointment with me some time this evening;\r\nit is a matter of life and death.”\r\n\r\n“Really, young man!” cried Father Goriot, with a change of countenance;\r\n“are you really paying court to his daughter, as those simpletons were\r\nsaying down below?... _Tonnerre de dieu!_ you have no notion what a tap\r\n_a la Goriot_ is like, and if you are playing a double game, I shall put\r\na stop to it by one blow of the fist... Oh! the thing is impossible!”\r\n\r\n“I swear to you that I love but one woman in the world,” said the\r\nstudent. “I only knew it a moment ago.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! what happiness!” cried Goriot.\r\n\r\n“But young Taillefer has been called out; the duel comes off to-morrow\r\nmorning, and I have heard it said that he may lose his life in it.”\r\n\r\n“But what business is it of yours?” said Goriot.\r\n\r\n“Why, I ought to tell him so, that he may prevent his son from putting\r\nin an appearance----”\r\n\r\nJust at that moment Vautrin’s voice broke in upon them; he was standing\r\nat the threshold of his door and singing:\r\n\r\n     “Oh! Richard, oh my king!\r\n      All the world abandons thee!\r\n      Broum! broum! broum! broum! broum!\r\n\r\n      The same old story everywhere,\r\n      A roving heart and a... tra la la.”\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen!” shouted Christophe, “the soup is ready, and every one is\r\nwaiting for you.”\r\n\r\n“Here,” Vautrin called down to him, “come and take a bottle of my\r\nBordeaux.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think your watch is pretty?” asked Goriot. “She has good taste,\r\nhasn’t she? Eh?”\r\n\r\nVautrin, Father Goriot, and Rastignac came downstairs in company, and,\r\nall three of them being late, were obliged to sit together.\r\n\r\nEugene was as distant as possible in his manner to Vautrin during\r\ndinner; but the other, so charming in Mme. Vauquer’s opinion, had never\r\nbeen so witty. His lively sallies and sparkling talk put the whole\r\ntable in good humor. His assurance and coolness filled Eugene with\r\nconsternation.\r\n\r\n“Why, what has come to you to-day?” inquired Mme. Vauquer. “You are as\r\nmerry as a skylark.”\r\n\r\n“I am always in spirits after I have made a good bargain.”\r\n\r\n“Bargain?” said Eugene.\r\n\r\n“Well, yes, bargain. I have just delivered a lot of goods, and I shall\r\nbe paid a handsome commission on them--Mlle. Michonneau,” he went on,\r\nseeing that the elderly spinster was scrutinizing him intently, “have\r\nyou any objection to some feature in my face, that you are making those\r\nlynx eyes at me? Just let me know, and I will have it changed to oblige\r\nyou... We shall not fall out about it, Poiret, I dare say?” he added,\r\nwinking at the superannuated clerk.\r\n\r\n“Bless my soul, you ought to stand as model for a burlesque Hercules,”\r\n said the young painter.\r\n\r\n“I will, upon my word! if Mlle. Michonneau will consent to sit as the\r\nVenus of Pere-Lachaise,” replied Vautrin.\r\n\r\n“There’s Poiret,” suggested Bianchon.\r\n\r\n“Oh! Poiret shall pose as Poiret. He can be a garden god!” cried\r\nVautrin; “his name means a pear----”\r\n\r\n“A sleepy pear!” Bianchon put in. “You will come in between the pear and\r\nthe cheese.”\r\n\r\n“What stuff are you all talking!” said Mme. Vauquer; “you would do\r\nbetter to treat us to your Bordeaux; I see a glimpse of a bottle there.\r\nIt would keep us all in a good humor, and it is good for the stomach\r\nbesides.”\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” said Vautrin, “the Lady President calls us to order. Mme.\r\nCouture and Mlle. Victorine will take your jokes in good part, but\r\nrespect the innocence of the aged Goriot. I propose a glass or two of\r\nBordeauxrama, rendered twice illustrious by the name of Laffite, no\r\npolitical allusions intended.--Come, you Turk!” he added, looking at\r\nChristophe, who did not offer to stir. “Christophe! Here! What, you\r\ndon’t answer to your own name? Bring us some liquor, Turk!”\r\n\r\n“Here it is, sir,” said Christophe, holding out the bottle.\r\n\r\nVautrin filled Eugene’s glass and Goriot’s likewise, then he\r\ndeliberately poured out a few drops into his own glass, and sipped it\r\nwhile his two neighbors drank their wine. All at once he made a grimace.\r\n\r\n“Corked!” he cried. “The devil! You can drink the rest of this,\r\nChristophe, and go and find another bottle; take from the right-hand\r\nside, you know. There are sixteen of us; take down eight bottles.”\r\n\r\n“If you are going to stand treat,” said the painter, “I will pay for a\r\nhundred chestnuts.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! oh!”\r\n\r\n“Booououh!”\r\n\r\n“Prrr!”\r\n\r\nThese exclamations came from all parts of the table like squibs from a\r\nset firework.\r\n\r\n“Come, now, Mama Vauquer, a couple of bottles of champagne,” called\r\nVautrin.\r\n\r\n“_Quien!_ just like you! Why not ask for the whole house at once. A\r\ncouple of bottles of champagne; that means twelve francs! I shall never\r\nsee the money back again, I know! But if M. Eugene has a mind to pay for\r\nit, I have some currant cordial.”\r\n\r\n“That currant cordial of hers is as bad as a black draught,” muttered\r\nthe medical student.\r\n\r\n“Shut up, Bianchon,” exclaimed Rastignac; “the very mention of black\r\ndraught makes me feel----. Yes, champagne, by all means; I will pay for\r\nit,” he added.\r\n\r\n“Sylvie,” called Mme. Vauquer, “bring in some biscuits, and the little\r\ncakes.”\r\n\r\n“Those little cakes are mouldy graybeards,” said Vautrin. “But trot out\r\nthe biscuits.”\r\n\r\nThe Bordeaux wine circulated; the dinner table became a livelier scene\r\nthan ever, and the fun grew fast and furious. Imitations of the cries\r\nof various animals mingled with the loud laughter; the Museum official\r\nhaving taken it into his head to mimic a cat-call rather like the\r\ncaterwauling of the animal in question, eight voices simultaneously\r\nstruck up with the following variations:\r\n\r\n“Scissors to grind!”\r\n\r\n“Chick-weeds for singing bir-ds!”\r\n\r\n“Brandy-snaps, ladies!”\r\n\r\n“China to mend!”\r\n\r\n“Boat ahoy!”\r\n\r\n“Sticks to beat your wives or your clothes!”\r\n\r\n“Old clo’!”\r\n\r\n“Cherries all ripe!”\r\n\r\nBut the palm was awarded to Bianchon for the nasal accent with which he\r\nrendered the cry of “Umbrellas to me-end!”\r\n\r\nA few seconds later, and there was a head-splitting racket in the\r\nroom, a storm of tomfoolery, a sort of cats’ concert, with Vautrin\r\nas conductor of the orchestra, the latter keeping an eye the while on\r\nEugene and Father Goriot. The wine seemed to have gone to their heads\r\nalready. They leaned back in their chairs, looking at the general\r\nconfusion with an air of gravity, and drank but little; both of them\r\nwere absorbed in the thought of what lay before them to do that evening,\r\nand yet neither of them felt able to rise and go. Vautrin gave a side\r\nglance at them from time to time, and watched the change that came over\r\ntheir faces, choosing the moment when their eyes drooped and seemed\r\nabout to close, to bend over Rastignac and to say in his ear:--\r\n\r\n“My little lad, you are not quite shrewd enough to outwit Papa Vautrin\r\nyet, and he is too fond of you to let you make a mess of your affairs.\r\nWhen I have made up my mind to do a thing, no one short of Providence\r\ncan put me off. Aha! we were for going round to warn old Taillefer,\r\ntelling tales out of school! The oven is hot, the dough is kneaded, the\r\nbread is ready for the oven; to-morrow we will eat it up and whisk away\r\nthe crumbs; and we are not going to spoil the baking? ... No, no, it is\r\nall as good as done! We may suffer from a few conscientious scruples,\r\nbut they will be digested along with the bread. While we are having our\r\nforty winks, Colonel Count Franchessini will clear the way to Michel\r\nTaillefer’s inheritance with the point of his sword. Victorine will come\r\nin for her brother’s money, a snug fifteen thousand francs a year. I\r\nhave made inquiries already, and I know that her late mother’s property\r\namounts to more than three hundred thousand----”\r\n\r\nEugene heard all this, and could not answer a word; his tongue seemed\r\nto be glued to the roof of his mouth, an irresistible drowsiness was\r\ncreeping over him. He still saw the table and the faces round it, but it\r\nwas through a bright mist. Soon the noise began to subside, one by one\r\nthe boarders went. At last, when their numbers had so dwindled that the\r\nparty consisted of Mme. Vauquer, Mme. Couture, Mlle. Victorine, Vautrin,\r\nand Father Goriot, Rastignac watched as though in a dream how Mme.\r\nVauquer busied herself by collecting the bottles, and drained the\r\nremainder of the wine out of each to fill others.\r\n\r\n“Oh! how uproarious they are! what a thing it is to be young!” said the\r\nwidow.\r\n\r\nThese were the last words that Eugene heard and understood.\r\n\r\n“There is no one like M. Vautrin for a bit of fun like this,” said\r\nSylvie. “There, just hark at Christophe, he is snoring like a top.”\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, mamma,” said Vautrin; “I am going to a theatre on the\r\nboulevard to see M. Marty in _Le Mont Sauvage_, a fine play taken\r\nfrom _Le Solitaire_.... If you like, I will take you and these two\r\nladies----”\r\n\r\n“Thank you; I must decline,” said Mme. Couture.\r\n\r\n“What! my good lady!” cried Mme. Vauquer, “decline to see a play founded\r\non the _Le Solitaire_, a work by Atala de Chateaubriand? We were so fond\r\nof that book that we cried over it like Magdalens under the _line-trees_\r\nlast summer, and then it is an improving work that might edify your\r\nyoung lady.”\r\n\r\n“We are forbidden to go to the play,” answered Victorine.\r\n\r\n“Just look, those two yonder have dropped off where they sit,” said\r\nVautrin, shaking the heads of the two sleepers in a comical way.\r\n\r\nHe altered the sleeping student’s position, settled his head more\r\ncomfortably on the back of his chair, kissed him warmly on the forehead,\r\nand began to sing:\r\n\r\n     “Sleep, little darlings;\r\n      I watch while you slumber.”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid he may be ill,” said Victorine.\r\n\r\n“Then stop and take care of him,” returned Vautrin. “‘Tis your duty as\r\na meek and obedient wife,” he whispered in her ear. “The young fellow\r\nworships you, and you will be his little wife--there’s your fortune for\r\nyou. In short,” he added aloud, “they lived happily ever afterwards,\r\nwere much looked up to in all the countryside, and had a numerous\r\nfamily. That is how all the romances end.--Now, mamma,” he went on, as\r\nhe turned to Madame Vauquer and put his arm round her waist, “put on\r\nyour bonnet, your best flowered silk, and the countess’ scarf, while I\r\ngo out and call a cab--all my own self.”\r\n\r\nAnd he started out, singing as he went:\r\n\r\n     “Oh! sun! divine sun!\r\n      Ripening the pumpkins every one.”\r\n\r\n“My goodness! Well, I’m sure! Mme. Couture, I could live happily in a\r\ngarret with a man like that.--There, now!” she added, looking round for\r\nthe old vermicelli maker, “there is that Father Goriot half seas over.\r\n_He_ never thought of taking me anywhere, the old skinflint. But he will\r\nmeasure his length somewhere. My word! it is disgraceful to lose his\r\nsenses like that, at his age! You will be telling me that he couldn’t\r\nlose what he hadn’t got--Sylvie, just take him up to his room!”\r\n\r\nSylvie took him by the arm, supported him upstairs, and flung him just\r\nas he was, like a package, across the bed.\r\n\r\n“Poor young fellow!” said Mme. Couture, putting back Eugene’s hair that\r\nhad fallen over his eyes; “he is like a young girl, he does not know\r\nwhat dissipation is.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I can tell you this, I know,” said Mme. Vauquer, “I have taken\r\nlodgers these thirty years, and a good many have passed through my\r\nhands, as the saying is, but I have never seen a nicer nor a more\r\naristocratic looking young man than M. Eugene. How handsome he looks\r\nsleeping! Just let his head rest on your shoulder, Mme. Couture. Pshaw!\r\nhe falls over towards Mlle. Victorine. There’s a special providence for\r\nyoung things. A little more, and he would have broken his head against\r\nthe knob of the chair. They’d make a pretty pair those two would!”\r\n\r\n“Hush, my good neighbor,” cried Mme. Couture, “you are saying such\r\nthings----”\r\n\r\n“Pooh!” put in Mme. Vauquer, “he does not hear.--Here, Sylvie! come and\r\nhelp me to dress. I shall put on my best stays.”\r\n\r\n“What! your best stays just after dinner, madame?” said Sylvie. “No, you\r\ncan get some one else to lace you. I am not going to be your murderer.\r\nIt’s a rash thing to do, and might cost you your life.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t care, I must do honor to M. Vautrin.”\r\n\r\n“Are you so fond of your heirs as all that?”\r\n\r\n“Come, Sylvie, don’t argue,” said the widow, as she left the room.\r\n\r\n“At her age, too!” said the cook to Victorine, pointing to her mistress\r\nas she spoke.\r\n\r\nMme. Couture and her ward were left in the dining-room, and Eugene\r\nslept on Victorine’s shoulder. The sound of Christophe’s snoring echoed\r\nthrough the silent house; Eugene’s quiet breathing seemed all the\r\nquieter by force of contrast, he was sleeping as peacefully as a child.\r\nVictorine was very happy; she was free to perform one of those acts of\r\ncharity which form an innocent outlet for all the overflowing sentiments\r\nof a woman’s nature; he was so close to her that she could feel the\r\nthrobbing of his heart; there was a look of almost maternal protection\r\nand conscious pride in Victorine’s face. Among the countless thoughts\r\nthat crowded up in her young innocent heart, there was a wild flutter of\r\njoy at this close contact.\r\n\r\n“Poor, dear child!” said Mme. Couture, squeezing her hand.\r\n\r\nThe old lady looked at the girl. Victorine’s innocent, pathetic face,\r\nso radiant with the new happiness that had befallen her, called to\r\nmind some naive work of mediaeval art, when the painter neglected the\r\naccessories, reserving all the magic of his brush for the quiet,\r\naustere outlines and ivory tints of the face, which seems to have caught\r\nsomething of the golden glory of heaven.\r\n\r\n“After all, he only took two glasses, mamma,” said Victorine, passing\r\nher fingers through Eugene’s hair.\r\n\r\n“Indeed, if he had been a dissipated young man, child, he would have\r\ncarried his wine like the rest of them. His drowsiness does him credit.”\r\n\r\nThere was a sound of wheels outside in the street.\r\n\r\n“There is M. Vautrin, mamma,” said the girl. “Just take M. Eugene. I\r\nwould rather not have that man see me like this; there are some ways of\r\nlooking at you that seem to sully your soul and make you feel as though\r\nyou had nothing on.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, you are wrong!” said Mme. Couture. “M. Vautrin is a worthy man;\r\nhe reminds me a little of my late husband, poor dear M. Couture, rough\r\nbut kind-hearted; his bark is worse than his bite.”\r\n\r\nVautrin came in while she was speaking; he did not make a sound, but\r\nlooked for a while at the picture of the two young faces--the lamplight\r\nfalling full upon them seemed to caress them.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he remarked, folding his arms, “here is a picture! It would have\r\nsuggested some pleasing pages to Bernardin de Saint-Pierre (good\r\nsoul), who wrote _Paul et Virginie_. Youth is very charming, Mme.\r\nCouture!--Sleep on, poor boy,” he added, looking at Eugene, “luck\r\nsometimes comes while you are sleeping.--There is something touching and\r\nattractive to me about this young man, madame,” he continued; “I know\r\nthat his nature is in harmony with his face. Just look, the head of\r\na cherub on an angel’s shoulder! He deserves to be loved. If I were a\r\nwoman, I would die (no--not such a fool), I would live for him.” He\r\nbent lower and spoke in the widow’s ear. “When I see those two together,\r\nmadame, I cannot help thinking that Providence meant them for each\r\nother; He works by secret ways, and tries the reins and the heart,” he\r\nsaid in a loud voice. “And when I see you, my children, thus united by\r\na like purity and by all human affections, I say to myself that it is\r\nquite impossible that the future should separate you. God is just.”--He\r\nturned to Victorine. “It seems to me,” he said, “that I have seen the\r\nline of success in your hand. Let me look at it, Mlle. Victorine; I am\r\nwell up in palmistry, and I have told fortunes many a time. Come, now,\r\ndon’t be frightened. Ah! what do I see? Upon my word, you will be one of\r\nthe richest heiresses in Paris before very long. You will heap riches\r\non the man who loves you. Your father will want you to go and live with\r\nhim. You will marry a young and handsome man with a title, and he will\r\nidolize you.”\r\n\r\nThe heavy footsteps of the coquettish widow, who was coming down the\r\nstairs, interrupted Vautrin’s fortune-telling. “Here is Mamma Vauquerre,\r\nfair as a starr-r-r, dressed within an inch of her life.--Aren’t we a\r\ntrifle pinched for room?” he inquired, with his arm round the lady;\r\n“we are screwed up very tightly about the bust, mamma! If we are much\r\nagitated, there may be an explosion; but I will pick up the fragments\r\nwith all the care of an antiquary.”\r\n\r\n“There is a man who can talk the language of French gallantry!” said the\r\nwidow, bending to speak in Mme. Couture’s ear.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, little ones!” said Vautrin, turning to Eugene and Victorine.\r\n“Bless you both!” and he laid a hand on either head. “Take my word for\r\nit, young lady, an honest man’s prayers are worth something; they should\r\nbring you happiness, for God hears them.”\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, dear,” said Mme. Vauquer to her lodger. “Do you think that M.\r\nVautrin means to run away with me?” she added, lowering her voice.\r\n\r\n“Lack-a-day!” said the widow.\r\n\r\n“Oh! mamma dear, suppose it should really happen as that kind M. Vautrin\r\nsaid!” said Victorine with a sigh as she looked at her hands. The two\r\nwomen were alone together.\r\n\r\n“Why, it wouldn’t take much to bring it to pass,” said the elderly lady;\r\n“just a fall from his horse, and your monster of a brother----”\r\n\r\n“Oh! mamma.”\r\n\r\n“Good Lord! Well, perhaps it is a sin to wish bad luck to an enemy,” the\r\nwidow remarked. “I will do penance for it. Still, I would strew\r\nflowers on his grave with the greatest pleasure, and that is the truth.\r\nBlack-hearted, that he is! The coward couldn’t speak up for his own\r\nmother, and cheats you out of your share by deceit and trickery. My\r\ncousin had a pretty fortune of her own, but unluckily for you, nothing\r\nwas said in the marriage-contract about anything that she might come in\r\nfor.”\r\n\r\n“It would be very hard if my fortune is to cost some one else his life,”\r\n said Victorine. “If I cannot be happy unless my brother is to be taken\r\nout of the world, I would rather stay here all my life.”\r\n\r\n“_Mon Dieu!_ it is just as that good M. Vautrin says, and he is full of\r\npiety, you see,” Mme. Couture remarked. “I am very glad to find that\r\nhe is not an unbeliever like the rest of them that talk of the Almighty\r\nwith less respect than they do of the Devil. Well, as he was saying, who\r\ncan know the ways by which it may please Providence to lead us?”\r\n\r\nWith Sylvie’s help the two women at last succeeded in getting Eugene\r\nup to his room; they laid him on the bed, and the cook unfastened\r\nhis clothes to make him more comfortable. Before they left the room,\r\nVictorine snatched an opportunity when her guardian’s back was turned,\r\nand pressed a kiss on Eugene’s forehead, feeling all the joy that this\r\nstolen pleasure could give her. Then she looked round the room, and\r\ngathering up, as it were, into one single thought all the untold bliss\r\nof that day, she made a picture of her memories, and dwelt upon it until\r\nshe slept, the happiest creature in Paris.\r\n\r\nThat evening’s merry-making, in the course of which Vautrin had\r\ngiven the drugged wine to Eugene and Father Goriot, was his own\r\nruin. Bianchon, flustered with wine, forgot to open the subject of\r\nTrompe-la-Mort with Mlle. Michonneau. The mere mention of the name would\r\nhave set Vautrin on his guard; for Vautrin, or, to give him his real\r\nname, Jacques Collin, was in fact the notorious escaped convict.\r\n\r\nBut it was the joke about the Venus of Pere-Lachaise that finally\r\ndecided his fate. Mlle. Michonneau had very nearly made up her mind to\r\nwarn the convict and to throw herself on his generosity, with the idea\r\nof making a better bargain for herself by helping him to escape that\r\nnight; but as it was, she went out escorted by Poiret in search of the\r\nfamous chief of detectives in the Petite Rue Saint-Anne, still thinking\r\nthat it was the district superintendent--one Gondureau--with whom she\r\nhad to do. The head of the department received his visitors courteously.\r\nThere was a little talk, and the details were definitely arranged. Mlle.\r\nMichonneau asked for the draught that she was to administer in order to\r\nset about her investigation. But the great man’s evident satisfaction\r\nset Mlle. Michonneau thinking; and she began to see that this business\r\ninvolved something more than the mere capture of a runaway convict. She\r\nracked her brains while he looked in a drawer in his desk for the\r\nlittle phial, and it dawned upon her that in consequence of treacherous\r\nrevelations made by the prisoners the police were hoping to lay their\r\nhands on a considerable sum of money. But on hinting her suspicions to\r\nthe old fox of the Petite Rue Saint-Anne, that officer began to smile,\r\nand tried to put her off the scent.\r\n\r\n“A delusion,” he said. “Collin’s _sorbonne_ is the most dangerous that\r\nhas yet been found among the dangerous classes. That is all, and the\r\nrascals are quite aware of it. They rally round him; he is the backbone\r\nof the federation, its Bonaparte, in short; he is very popular with them\r\nall. The rogue will never leave his _chump_ in the Place de Greve.”\r\n\r\nAs Mlle. Michonneau seemed mystified, Gondureau explained the two\r\nslang words for her benefit. _Sorbonne_ and _chump_ are two forcible\r\nexpressions borrowed from thieves’ Latin, thieves, of all people, being\r\ncompelled to consider the human head in its two aspects. A sorbonne is\r\nthe head of a living man, his faculty of thinking--his council; a chump\r\nis a contemptuous epithet that implies how little a human head is worth\r\nafter the axe has done its work.\r\n\r\n“Collin is playing us off,” he continued. “When we come across a man\r\nlike a bar of steel tempered in the English fashion, there is always one\r\nresource left--we can kill him if he takes it into his head to make the\r\nleast resistance. We are reckoning on several methods of killing Collin\r\nto-morrow morning. It saves a trial, and society is rid of him without\r\nall the expense of guarding and feeding him. What with getting up the\r\ncase, summoning witnesses, paying their expenses, and carrying out the\r\nsentence, it costs a lot to go through all the proper formalities before\r\nyou can get quit of one of these good-for-nothings, over and above the\r\nthree thousand francs that you are going to have. There is a saving\r\nin time as well. One good thrust of the bayonet into Trompe-la-Mort’s\r\npaunch will prevent scores of crimes, and save fifty scoundrels from\r\nfollowing his example; they will be very careful to keep themselves out\r\nof the police courts. That is doing the work of the police thoroughly,\r\nand true philanthropists will tell you that it is better to prevent\r\ncrime than to punish it.”\r\n\r\n“And you do a service to our country,” said Poiret.\r\n\r\n“Really, you are talking in a very sensible manner tonight, that you\r\nare,” said the head of the department. “Yes, of course, we are serving\r\nour country, and we are very hardly used too. We do society very great\r\nservices that are not recognized. In fact, a superior man must rise\r\nabove vulgar prejudices, and a Christian must resign himself to\r\nthe mishaps that doing right entails, when right is done in an\r\nout-of-the-way style. Paris is Paris, you see! That is the explanation\r\nof my life.--I have the honor to wish you a good-evening, mademoiselle.\r\nI shall bring my men to the Jardin du Roi in the morning. Send\r\nChristophe to the Rue du Buffon, tell him to ask for M. Gondureau in the\r\nhouse where you saw me before.--Your servant, sir. If you should ever\r\nhave anything stolen from you, come to me, and I will do my best to get\r\nit back for you.”\r\n\r\n“Well, now,” Poiret remarked to Mlle. Michonneau, “there are idiots\r\nwho are scared out of their wits by the word police. That was a very\r\npleasant-spoken gentleman, and what he wants you to do is as easy as\r\nsaying ‘Good-day.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day was destined to be one of the most extraordinary in the\r\nannals of the Maison Vauquer. Hitherto the most startling occurrence in\r\nits tranquil existence had been the portentous, meteor-like apparition\r\nof the sham Comtesse de l’Ambermesnil. But the catastrophes of this\r\ngreat day were to cast all previous events into the shade, and supply an\r\ninexhaustible topic of conversation for Mme. Vauquer and her boarders so\r\nlong as she lived.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, Goriot and Eugene de Rastignac both slept till close\r\nupon eleven o’clock. Mme. Vauquer, who came home about midnight from\r\nthe Gaite, lay a-bed till half-past ten. Christophe, after a prolonged\r\nslumber (he had finished Vautrin’s first bottle of wine), was behindhand\r\nwith his work, but Poiret and Mlle. Michonneau uttered no complaint,\r\nthough breakfast was delayed. As for Victorine and Mme. Couture, they\r\nalso lay late. Vautrin went out before eight o’clock, and only came back\r\njust as breakfast was ready. Nobody protested, therefore, when Sylvie\r\nand Christophe went up at a quarter past eleven, knocked at all the\r\ndoors, and announced that breakfast was waiting. While Sylvie and the\r\nman were upstairs, Mlle. Michonneau, who came down first, poured the\r\ncontents of the phial into the silver cup belonging to Vautrin--it was\r\nstanding with the others in the bain-marie that kept the cream hot for\r\nthe morning coffee. The spinster had reckoned on this custom of the\r\nhouse to do her stroke of business. The seven lodgers were at last\r\ncollected together, not without some difficulty. Just as Eugene came\r\ndownstairs, stretching himself and yawning, a commissionaire handed him\r\na letter from Mme. de Nucingen. It ran thus:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“I feel neither false vanity nor anger where you are concerned, my\r\nfriend. Till two o’clock this morning I waited for you. Oh, that waiting\r\nfor one whom you love! No one that had passed through that torture could\r\ninflict it on another. I know now that you have never loved before.\r\nWhat can have happened? Anxiety has taken hold of me. I would have come\r\nmyself to find out what had happened, if I had not feared to betray the\r\nsecrets of my heart. How can I walk out or drive out at this time of\r\nday? Would it not be ruin? I have felt to the full how wretched it is to\r\nbe a woman. Send a word to reassure me, and explain how it is that you\r\nhave not come after what my father told you. I shall be angry, but I\r\nwill forgive you. One word, for pity’s sake. You will come to me soon,\r\nwill you not? If you are busy, a line will be enough. Say, ‘I will\r\nhasten to you,’ or else, ‘I am ill.’ But if you were ill my father would\r\nhave come to tell me so. What can have happened?...”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed, what has happened?” exclaimed Eugene, and, hurrying down\r\nto the dining-room, he crumpled up the letter without reading any more.\r\n“What time is it?”\r\n\r\n“Half-past eleven,” said Vautrin, dropping a lump of sugar into his\r\ncoffee.\r\n\r\nThe escaped convict cast a glance at Eugene, a cold and fascinating\r\nglance; men gifted with this magnetic power can quell furious lunatics\r\nin a madhouse by such a glance, it is said. Eugene shook in every limb.\r\nThere was the sound of wheels in the street, and in another moment a man\r\nwith a scared face rushed into the room. It was one of M. Taillefer’s\r\nservants; Mme. Couture recognized the livery at once.\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle,” he cried, “your father is asking for you--something\r\nterrible has happened! M. Frederic has had a sword thrust in the\r\nforehead in a duel, and the doctors have given him up. You will scarcely\r\nbe in time to say good-bye to him! he is unconscious.”\r\n\r\n“Poor young fellow!” exclaimed Vautrin. “How can people brawl when they\r\nhave a certain income of thirty thousand livres? Young people have bad\r\nmanners, and that is a fact.”\r\n\r\n“Sir!” cried Eugene.\r\n\r\n“Well, what then, you big baby!” said Vautrin, swallowing down his\r\ncoffee imperturbably, an operation which Mlle. Michonneau watched with\r\nsuch close attention that she had no emotion to spare for the amazing\r\nnews that had struck the others dumb with amazement. “Are there not\r\nduels every morning in Paris?” added Vautrin.\r\n\r\n“I will go with you, Victorine,” said Mme. Couture, and the two women\r\nhurried away at once without either hats or shawls. But before she\r\nwent, Victorine, with her eyes full of tears, gave Eugene a glance that\r\nsaid--“How little I thought that our happiness should cost me tears!”\r\n\r\n“Dear me, you are a prophet, M. Vautrin,” said Mme. Vauquer.\r\n\r\n“I am all sorts of things,” said Vautrin.\r\n\r\n“Queer, isn’t it?” said Mme. Vauquer, stringing together a succession of\r\ncommonplaces suited to the occasion. “Death takes us off without asking\r\nus about it. The young often go before the old. It is a lucky thing\r\nfor us women that we are not liable to fight duels, but we have other\r\ncomplaints that men don’t suffer from. We bear children, and it takes a\r\nlong time to get over it. What a windfall for Victorine! Her father will\r\nhave to acknowledge her now!”\r\n\r\n“There!” said Vautrin, looking at Eugene, “yesterday she had not a\r\npenny; this morning she has several millions to her fortune.”\r\n\r\n“I say, M. Eugene!” cried Mme. Vauquer, “you have landed on your feet!”\r\n\r\nAt this exclamation, Father Goriot looked at the student, and saw the\r\ncrumpled letter still in his hand.\r\n\r\n“You have not read it through! What does this mean? Are you going to be\r\nlike the rest of them?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Madame, I shall never marry Mlle. Victorine,” said Eugene, turning to\r\nMme. Vauquer with an expression of terror and loathing that surprised\r\nthe onlookers at this scene.\r\n\r\nFather Goriot caught the student’s hand and grasped it warmly. He could\r\nhave kissed it.\r\n\r\n“Oh, ho!” said Vautrin, “the Italians have a good proverb--_Col tempo_.”\r\n\r\n“Is there any answer?” said Mme. de Nucingen’s messenger, addressing\r\nEugene.\r\n\r\n“Say that I will come directly.”\r\n\r\nThe man went. Eugene was in a state of such violent excitement that he\r\ncould not be prudent.\r\n\r\n“What is to be done?” he exclaimed aloud. “There are no proofs!”\r\n\r\nVautrin began to smile. Though the drug he had taken was doing its work,\r\nthe convict was so vigorous that he rose to his feet, gave Rastignac a\r\nlook, and said in hollow tones, “Luck comes to us while we sleep, young\r\nman,” and fell stiff and stark, as if he were struck dead.\r\n\r\n“So there is a Divine Justice!” said Eugene.\r\n\r\n“Well, if ever! What has come to that poor dear M. Vautrin?”\r\n\r\n“A stroke!” cried Mlle. Michonneau.\r\n\r\n“Here, Sylvie! girl, run for the doctor,” called the widow. “Oh, M.\r\nRastignac, just go for M. Bianchon, and be as quick as you can; Sylvie\r\nmight not be in time to catch our doctor, M. Grimprel.”\r\n\r\nRastignac was glad of an excuse to leave that den of horrors, his hurry\r\nfor the doctor was nothing but a flight.\r\n\r\n“Here, Christophe, go round to the chemist’s and ask for something\r\nthat’s good for the apoplexy.”\r\n\r\nChristophe likewise went.\r\n\r\n“Father Goriot, just help us to get him upstairs.”\r\n\r\nVautrin was taken up among them, carried carefully up the narrow\r\nstaircase, and laid upon his bed.\r\n\r\n“I can do no good here, so I shall go to see my daughter,” said M.\r\nGoriot.\r\n\r\n“Selfish old thing!” cried Mme. Vauquer. “Yes, go; I wish you may die\r\nlike a dog.”\r\n\r\n“Just go and see if you can find some ether,” said Mlle. Michonneau to\r\nMme. Vauquer; the former, with some help from Poiret, had unfastened the\r\nsick man’s clothes.\r\n\r\nMme. Vauquer went down to her room, and left Mlle. Michonneau mistress\r\nof the situation.\r\n\r\n“Now! just pull down his shirt and turn him over, quick! You might be\r\nof some use in sparing my modesty,” she said to Poiret, “instead of\r\nstanding there like a stock.”\r\n\r\nVautrin was turned over; Mlle. Michonneau gave his shoulder a sharp\r\nslap, and the two portentous letters appeared, white against the red.\r\n\r\n“There, you have earned your three thousand francs very easily,”\r\n exclaimed Poiret, supporting Vautrin while Mlle. Michonneau slipped\r\non the shirt again.--“Ouf! How heavy he is,” he added, as he laid the\r\nconvict down.\r\n\r\n“Hush! Suppose there is a strong-box here!” said the old maid briskly;\r\nher glances seemed to pierce the walls, she scrutinized every article of\r\nthe furniture with greedy eyes. “Could we find some excuse for opening\r\nthat desk?”\r\n\r\n“It mightn’t be quite right,” responded Poiret to this.\r\n\r\n“Where is the harm? It is money stolen from all sorts of people, so\r\nit doesn’t belong to any one now. But we haven’t time, there is the\r\nVauquer.”\r\n\r\n“Here is the ether,” said that lady. “I must say that this is an\r\neventful day. Lord! that man can’t have had a stroke; he is as white as\r\ncurds.”\r\n\r\n“White as curds?” echoed Poiret.\r\n\r\n“And his pulse is steady,” said the widow, laying her hand on his\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\n“Steady?” said the astonished Poiret.\r\n\r\n“He is all right.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think so?” asked Poiret.\r\n\r\n“Lord! Yes, he looks as if he were sleeping. Sylvie has gone for a\r\ndoctor. I say, Mlle. Michonneau, he is sniffing the ether. Pooh! it is\r\nonly a spasm. His pulse is good. He is as strong as a Turk. Just look,\r\nmademoiselle, what a fur tippet he has on his chest; that is the sort\r\nof man to live till he is a hundred. His wig holds on tightly, however.\r\nDear me! it is glued on, and his own hair is red; that is why he wears\r\na wig. They say that red-haired people are either the worst or the best.\r\nIs he one of the good ones, I wonder?”\r\n\r\n“Good to hang,” said Poiret.\r\n\r\n“Round a pretty woman’s neck, you mean,” said Mlle Michonneau, hastily.\r\n“Just go away, M. Poiret. It is a woman’s duty to nurse you men when you\r\nare ill. Besides, for all the good you are doing, you may as well take\r\nyourself off,” she added. “Mme. Vauquer and I will take great care of\r\ndear M. Vautrin.”\r\n\r\nPoiret went out on tiptoe without a murmur, like a dog kicked out of the\r\nroom by his master.\r\n\r\nRastignac had gone out for the sake of physical exertion; he wanted\r\nto breathe the air, he felt stifled. Yesterday evening he had meant to\r\nprevent the murder arranged for half-past eight that morning. What had\r\nhappened? What ought he to do now? He trembled to think that he himself\r\nmight be implicated. Vautrin’s coolness still further dismayed him.\r\n\r\n“Yet, how if Vautrin should die without saying a word?” Rastignac asked\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nHe hurried along the alleys of the Luxembourg Gardens as if the hounds\r\nof justice were after him, and he already heard the baying of the pack.\r\n\r\n“Well?” shouted Bianchon, “you have seen the _Pilote_?”\r\n\r\nThe _Pilote_ was a Radical sheet, edited by M. Tissot. It came out\r\nseveral hours later than the morning papers, and was meant for the\r\nbenefit of country subscribers; for it brought the morning news into\r\nprovincial districts twenty-four hours sooner than the ordinary local\r\njournals.\r\n\r\n“There is a wonderful history in it,” said the house student of the\r\nHopital Cochin. “Young Taillefer called out Count Franchessini, of\r\nthe Old Guard, and the Count put a couple of inches of steel into his\r\nforehead. And here is little Victorine one of the richest heiresses in\r\nParis! If we had known that, eh? What a game of chance death is! They\r\nsay Victorine was sweet on you; was there any truth in it?”\r\n\r\n“Shut up, Bianchon; I shall never marry her. I am in love with a\r\ncharming woman, and she is in love with me, so----”\r\n\r\n“You said that as if you were screwing yourself up to be faithful\r\nto her. I should like to see the woman worth the sacrifice of Master\r\nTaillefer’s money!”\r\n\r\n“Are all the devils of hell at my heels?” cried Rastignac.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter with you? Are you mad? Give us your hand,” said\r\nBianchon, “and let me feel your pulse. You are feverish.”\r\n\r\n“Just go to Mother Vauquer’s,” said Rastignac; “that scoundrel Vautrin\r\nhas dropped down like one dead.”\r\n\r\n“Aha!” said Bianchon, leaving Rastignac to his reflections, “you confirm\r\nmy suspicions, and now I mean to make sure for myself.”\r\n\r\nThe law student’s long walk was a memorable one for him. He made in\r\nsome sort a survey of his conscience. After a close scrutiny, after\r\nhesitation and self-examination, his honor at any rate came out\r\nscatheless from this sharp and terrible ordeal, like a bar of iron\r\ntested in the English fashion. He remembered Father Goriot’s confidences\r\nof the evening before; he recollected the rooms taken for him in the Rue\r\nd’Artois, so that he might be near Delphine; and then he thought of his\r\nletter, and read it again and kissed it.\r\n\r\n“Such a love is my anchor of safety,” he said to himself. “How the old\r\nman’s heart must have been wrung! He says nothing about all that he has\r\nbeen through; but who could not guess? Well, then, I will be like a\r\nson to him; his life shall be made happy. If she cares for me, she will\r\noften come to spend the day with him. That grand Comtesse de Restaud is\r\na heartless thing; she would make her father into her hall porter. Dear\r\nDelphine! she is kinder to the old man; she is worthy to be loved. Ah!\r\nthis evening I shall be very happy!”\r\n\r\nHe took out his watch and admired it.\r\n\r\n“I have had nothing but success! If two people mean to love each other\r\nfor ever, they may help each other, and I can take this. Besides,\r\nI shall succeed, and I will pay her a hundredfold. There is nothing\r\ncriminal in this _liaison_; nothing that could cause the most austere\r\nmoralist to frown. How many respectable people contract similar unions!\r\nWe deceive nobody; it is deception that makes a position humiliating.\r\nIf you lie, you lower yourself at once. She and her husband have lived\r\napart for a long while. Besides, how if I called upon that Alsatian to\r\nresign a wife whom he cannot make happy?”\r\n\r\nRastignac’s battle with himself went on for a long while; and though the\r\nscruples of youth inevitably gained the day, an irresistible curiosity\r\nled him, about half-past four, to return to the Maison Vauquer through\r\nthe gathering dusk.\r\n\r\nBianchon had given Vautrin an emetic, reserving the contents of the\r\nstomach for chemical analysis at the hospital. Mlle. Michonneau’s\r\nofficious alacrity had still further strengthened his suspicions of her.\r\nVautrin, moreover, had recovered so quickly that it was impossible\r\nnot to suspect some plot against the leader of all frolics at the\r\nlodging-house. Vautrin was standing in front of the stove in the\r\ndining-room when Rastignac came in. All the lodgers were assembled\r\nsooner than usual by the news of young Taillefer’s duel. They were\r\nanxious to hear any detail about the affair, and to talk over the\r\nprobable change in Victorine’s prospects. Father Goriot alone was\r\nabsent, but the rest were chatting. No sooner did Eugene come into the\r\nroom, than his eyes met the inscrutable gaze of Vautrin. It was the same\r\nlook that had read his thoughts before--the look that had such power to\r\nwaken evil thoughts in his heart. He shuddered.\r\n\r\n“Well, dear boy,” said the escaped convict, “I am likely to cheat death\r\nfor a good while yet. According to these ladies, I have had a stroke\r\nthat would have felled an ox, and come off with flying colors.”\r\n\r\n“A bull you might say,” cried the widow.\r\n\r\n“You really might be sorry to see me still alive,” said Vautrin in\r\nRastignac’s ear, thinking that he guessed the student’s thoughts. “You\r\nmust be mighty sure of yourself.”\r\n\r\n“Mlle. Michonneau was talking the day before yesterday about a gentleman\r\nnamed _Trompe-la-Mort_,” said Bianchon; “and, upon my word, that name\r\nwould do very well for you.”\r\n\r\nVautrin seemed thunderstruck. He turned pale, and staggered back.\r\nHe turned his magnetic glance, like a ray of vivid light, on Mlle.\r\nMichonneau; the old maid shrank and trembled under the influence of that\r\nstrong will, and collapsed into a chair. The mask of good-nature had\r\ndropped from the convict’s face; from the unmistakable ferocity of that\r\nsinister look, Poiret felt that the old maid was in danger, and hastily\r\nstepped between them. None of the lodgers understood this scene in the\r\nleast, they looked on in mute amazement. There was a pause. Just then\r\nthere was a sound of tramping feet outside; there were soldiers there,\r\nit seemed, for there was a ring of several rifles on the pavement of\r\nthe street. Collin was mechanically looking round the walls for a way of\r\nescape, when four men entered by way of the sitting-room.\r\n\r\n“In the name of the King and the Law!” said an officer, but the words\r\nwere almost lost in a murmur of astonishment.\r\n\r\nSilence fell on the room. The lodgers made way for three of the men, who\r\nhad each a hand on a cocked pistol in a side pocket. Two policemen, who\r\nfollowed the detectives, kept the entrance to the sitting-room, and two\r\nmore men appeared in the doorway that gave access to the staircase. A\r\nsound of footsteps came from the garden, and again the rifles of several\r\nsoldiers rang on the cobblestones under the window. All chance of\r\nsalvation by flight was cut off for Trompe-la-Mort, to whom all eyes\r\ninstinctively turned. The chief walked straight up to him, and commenced\r\noperations by giving him a sharp blow on the head, so that the wig fell\r\noff, and Collin’s face was revealed in all its ugliness. There was\r\na terrible suggestion of strength mingled with cunning in the short,\r\nbrick-red crop of hair, the whole head was in harmony with his powerful\r\nframe, and at that moment the fires of hell seemed to gleam from his\r\neyes. In that flash the real Vautrin shone forth, revealed at once\r\nbefore them all; they understood his past, his present, and future, his\r\npitiless doctrines, his actions, the religion of his own good pleasure,\r\nthe majesty with which his cynicism and contempt for mankind invested\r\nhim, the physical strength of an organization proof against all trials.\r\nThe blood flew to his face, and his eyes glared like the eyes of a wild\r\ncat. He started back with savage energy and a fierce growl that drew\r\nexclamations of alarm from the lodgers. At that leonine start the police\r\ncaught at their pistols under cover of the general clamor. Collin saw\r\nthe gleaming muzzles of the weapons, saw his danger, and instantly gave\r\nproof of a power of the highest order. There was something horrible and\r\nmajestic in the spectacle of the sudden transformation in his face; he\r\ncould only be compared to a cauldron full of the steam that can send\r\nmountains flying, a terrific force dispelled in a moment by a drop\r\nof cold water. The drop of water that cooled his wrathful fury was a\r\nreflection that flashed across his brain like lightning. He began to\r\nsmile, and looked down at his wig.\r\n\r\n“You are not in the politest of humors to-day,” he remarked to the\r\nchief, and he held out his hands to the policemen with a jerk of his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” he said, “put on the bracelets or the handcuffs. I call on\r\nthose present to witness that I make no resistance.”\r\n\r\nA murmur of admiration ran through the room at the sudden outpouring\r\nlike fire and lava flood from this human volcano, and its equally sudden\r\ncessation.\r\n\r\n“There’s a sell for you, master crusher,” the convict added, looking at\r\nthe famous director of police.\r\n\r\n“Come, strip!” said he of the Petite Rue Saint-Anne, contemptuously.\r\n\r\n“Why?” asked Collin. “There are ladies present; I deny nothing, and\r\nsurrender.”\r\n\r\nHe paused, and looked round the room like an orator who is about to\r\noverwhelm his audience.\r\n\r\n“Take this down, Daddy Lachapelle,” he went on, addressing a little,\r\nwhite-haired old man who had seated himself at the end of the table; and\r\nafter drawing a printed form from the portfolio, was proceeding to draw\r\nup a document. “I acknowledge myself to be Jacques Collin, otherwise\r\nknown as Trompe-la-Mort, condemned to twenty years’ penal servitude, and\r\nI have just proved that I have come fairly by my nickname.--If I had\r\nas much as raised my hand,” he went on, addressing the other lodgers,\r\n“those three sneaking wretches yonder would have drawn claret on Mamma\r\nVauquer’s domestic hearth. The rogues have laid their heads together to\r\nset a trap for me.”\r\n\r\nMme. Vauquer felt sick and faint at these words.\r\n\r\n“Good Lord!” she cried, “this does give one a turn; and me at the Gaite\r\nwith him only last night!” she said to Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“Summon your philosophy, mamma,” Collin resumed. “Is it a misfortune to\r\nhave sat in my box at the Gaite yesterday evening? After all, are you\r\nbetter than we are? The brand upon our shoulders is less shameful than\r\nthe brand set on your hearts, you flabby members of a society rotten\r\nto the core. Not the best man among you could stand up to me.” His\r\neyes rested upon Rastignac, to whom he spoke with a pleasant smile\r\nthat seemed strangely at variance with the savage expression in his\r\neyes.--“Our little bargain still holds good, dear boy; you can accept\r\nany time you like! Do you understand?” And he sang:\r\n\r\n     “A charming girl is my Fanchette\r\n      In her simplicity.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you trouble yourself,” he went on; “I can get in my money. They\r\nare too much afraid of me to swindle me.”\r\n\r\nThe convicts’ prison, its language and customs, its sudden sharp\r\ntransitions from the humorous to the horrible, its appalling grandeur,\r\nits triviality and its dark depths, were all revealed in turn by the\r\nspeaker’s discourse; he seemed to be no longer a man, but the type and\r\nmouthpiece of a degenerate race, a brutal, supple, clear-headed race of\r\nsavages. In one moment Collin became the poet of an inferno, wherein all\r\nthoughts and passions that move human nature (save repentance) find a\r\nplace. He looked about him like a fallen archangel who is for war to the\r\nend. Rastignac lowered his eyes, and acknowledged this kinship claimed\r\nby crime as an expiation of his own evil thoughts.\r\n\r\n“Who betrayed me?” said Collin, and his terrible eyes traveled round the\r\nroom. Suddenly they rested on Mlle. Michonneau.\r\n\r\n“It was you, old cat!” he said. “That sham stroke of apoplexy was your\r\ndoing, lynx eyes!... Two words from me, and your throat would be cut in\r\nless than a week, but I forgive you, I am a Christian. You did not sell\r\nme either. But who did?----Aha! you may rummage upstairs,” he shouted,\r\nhearing the police officers opening his cupboards and taking possession\r\nof his effects. “The nest is empty, the birds flew away yesterday, and\r\nyou will be none the wiser. My ledgers are here,” he said tapping his\r\nforehead. “Now I know who sold me! It could only be that blackguard\r\nFil-de-Soie. That is who it was, old catchpoll, eh?” he said, turning to\r\nthe chief. “It was timed so neatly to get the banknotes up above there.\r\nThere is nothing left for you--spies! As for Fil-de-Soie, he will be\r\nunder the daisies in less than a fortnight, even if you were to tell off\r\nthe whole force to protect him. How much did you give the Michonnette?”\r\n he asked of the police officers. “A thousand crowns? Oh you Ninon in\r\ndecay, Pompadour in tatters, Venus of the graveyard, I was worth more\r\nthan that! If you had given me warning, you should have had six thousand\r\nfrancs. Ah! you had no suspicion of that, old trafficker in flesh and\r\nblood, or I should have had the preference. Yes, I would have given six\r\nthousand francs to save myself an inconvenient journey and some loss of\r\nmoney,” he said, as they fastened the handcuffs on his wrists. “These\r\nfolks will amuse themselves by dragging out this business till the end\r\nof time to keep me idle. If they were to send me straight to jail, I\r\nshould soon be back at my old tricks in spite of the duffers at the Quai\r\ndes Orfevres. Down yonder they will all turn themselves inside out to\r\nhelp their general--their good Trompe-la-Mort--to get clear away. Is\r\nthere a single one among you that can say, as I can, that he has ten\r\nthousand brothers ready to do anything for him?” he asked proudly.\r\n“There is some good there,” he said tapping his heart; “I have never\r\nbetrayed any one!--Look you here, you slut,” he said to the old maid,\r\n“they are all afraid of me, do you see? but the sight of you turns them\r\nsick. Rake in your gains.”\r\n\r\nHe was silent for a moment, and looked round at the lodgers’ faces.\r\n\r\n“What dolts you are, all of you! Have you never seen a convict before?\r\nA convict of Collin’s stamp, whom you see before you, is a man less\r\nweak-kneed than others; he lifts up his voice against the colossal fraud\r\nof the Social Contract, as Jean Jacques did, whose pupil he is proud\r\nto declare himself. In short, I stand here single-handed against a\r\nGovernment and a whole subsidized machinery of tribunals and police, and\r\nI am a match for them all.”\r\n\r\n“Ye gods!” cried the painter, “what a magnificent sketch one might make\r\nof him!”\r\n\r\n“Look here, you gentlemen-in-waiting to his highness the gibbet, master\r\nof ceremonies to the widow” (a nickname full of sombre poetry, given\r\nby prisoners to the guillotine), “be a good fellow, and tell me if it\r\nreally was Fil-de-Soie who sold me. I don’t want him to suffer for some\r\none else, that would not be fair.”\r\n\r\nBut before the chief had time to answer, the rest of the party returned\r\nfrom making their investigations upstairs. Everything had been opened\r\nand inventoried. A few words passed between them and the chief, and the\r\nofficial preliminaries were complete.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” said Collin, addressing the lodgers, “they will take me\r\naway directly. You have all made my stay among you very agreeable, and I\r\nshall look back upon it with gratitude. Receive my adieux, and permit me\r\nto send you figs from Provence.”\r\n\r\nHe advanced a step or two, and then turned to look once more at\r\nRastignac.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, Eugene,” he said, in a sad and gentle tone, a strange\r\ntransition from his previous rough and stern manner. “If you should\r\nbe hard up, I have left you a devoted friend,” and, in spite of his\r\nshackles, he managed to assume a posture of defence, called, “One, two!”\r\n like a fencing-master, and lunged. “If anything goes wrong, apply in\r\nthat quarter. Man and money, all at your service.”\r\n\r\nThe strange speaker’s manner was sufficiently burlesque, so that no\r\none but Rastignac knew that there was a serious meaning underlying the\r\npantomime.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the police, soldiers, and detectives had left the house,\r\nSylvie, who was rubbing her mistress’ temples with vinegar, looked round\r\nat the bewildered lodgers.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said she, “he was a man, he was, for all that.”\r\n\r\nHer words broke the spell. Every one had been too much excited, too much\r\nmoved by very various feelings to speak. But now the lodgers began\r\nto look at each other, and then all eyes were turned at once on Mlle.\r\nMichonneau, a thin, shriveled, dead-alive, mummy-like figure, crouching\r\nby the stove; her eyes were downcast, as if she feared that the green\r\neye-shade could not shut out the expression of those faces from her.\r\nThis figure and the feeling of repulsion she had so long excited were\r\nexplained all at once. A smothered murmur filled the room; it was so\r\nunanimous, that it seemed as if the same feeling of loathing had pitched\r\nall the voices in one key. Mlle. Michonneau heard it, and did not stir.\r\nIt was Bianchon who was the first to move; he bent over his neighbor,\r\nand said in a low voice, “If that creature is going to stop here, and\r\nhave dinner with us, I shall clear out.”\r\n\r\nIn the twinkling of an eye it was clear that every one in the room, save\r\nPoiret, was of the medical student’s opinion, so that the latter, strong\r\nin the support of the majority, went up to that elderly person.\r\n\r\n“You are more intimate with Mlle. Michonneau than the rest of us,” he\r\nsaid; “speak to her, make her understand that she must go, and go at\r\nonce.”\r\n\r\n“At once!” echoed Poiret in amazement.\r\n\r\nThen he went across to the crouching figure, and spoke a few words in\r\nher ear.\r\n\r\n“I have paid beforehand for the quarter; I have as much right to be here\r\nas any one else,” she said, with a viperous look at the boarders.\r\n\r\n“Never mind that! we will club together and pay you the money back,”\r\n said Rastignac.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur is taking Collin’s part” she said, with a questioning,\r\nmalignant glance at the law student; “it is not difficult to guess why.”\r\n\r\nEugene started forward at the words, as if he meant to spring upon her\r\nand wring her neck. That glance, and the depths of treachery that it\r\nrevealed, had been a hideous enlightenment.\r\n\r\n“Let her alone!” cried the boarders.\r\n\r\nRastignac folded his arms and was silent.\r\n\r\n“Let us have no more of Mlle. Judas,” said the painter, turning to Mme.\r\nVauquer. “If you don’t show the Michonneau the door, madame, we shall\r\nall leave your shop, and wherever we go we shall say that there are only\r\nconvicts and spies left there. If you do the other thing, we will hold\r\nour tongues about the business; for when all is said and done, it might\r\nhappen in the best society until they brand them on the forehead, when\r\nthey send them to the hulks. They ought not to let convicts go about\r\nParis disguised like decent citizens, so as to carry on their antics\r\nlike a set of rascally humbugs, which they are.”\r\n\r\nAt this Mme. Vauquer recovered miraculously. She sat up and folded her\r\narms; her eyes were wide open now, and there was no sign of tears in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“Why, do you really mean to be the ruin of my establishment, my dear\r\nsir? There is M. Vautrin----Goodness,” she cried, interrupting herself,\r\n“I can’t help calling him by the name he passed himself off by for an\r\nhonest man! There is one room to let already, and you want me to\r\nturn out two more lodgers in the middle of the season, when no one is\r\nmoving----”\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, let us take our hats and go and dine at Flicoteaux’s in the\r\nPlace Sorbonne,” cried Bianchon.\r\n\r\nMme. Vauquer glanced round, and saw in a moment on which side her\r\ninterest lay. She waddled across to Mlle. Michonneau.\r\n\r\n“Come, now,” she said; “you would not be the ruin of my establishment,\r\nwould you, eh? There’s a dear, kind soul. You see what a pass these\r\ngentlemen have brought me to; just go up to your room for this evening.”\r\n\r\n“Never a bit of it!” cried the boarders. “She must go, and go this\r\nminute!”\r\n\r\n“But the poor lady has had no dinner,” said Poiret, with piteous\r\nentreaty.\r\n\r\n“She can go and dine where she likes,” shouted several voices.\r\n\r\n“Turn her out, the spy!”\r\n\r\n“Turn them both out! Spies!”\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” cried Poiret, his heart swelling with the courage that love\r\ngives to the ovine male, “respect the weaker sex.”\r\n\r\n“Spies are of no sex!” said the painter.\r\n\r\n“A precious sexorama!”\r\n\r\n“Turn her into the streetorama!”\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, this is not manners! If you turn people out of the house,\r\nit ought not to be done so unceremoniously and with no notice at all. We\r\nhave paid our money, and we are not going,” said Poiret, putting on his\r\ncap, and taking a chair beside Mlle. Michonneau, with whom Mme. Vauquer\r\nwas remonstrating.\r\n\r\n“Naughty boy!” said the painter, with a comical look; “run away, naughty\r\nlittle boy!”\r\n\r\n“Look here,” said Bianchon; “if you do not go, all the rest of us will,”\r\n and the boarders, to a man, made for the sitting-room-door.\r\n\r\n“Oh! mademoiselle, what is to be done?” cried Mme. Vauquer. “I am a\r\nruined woman. You can’t stay here; they will go further, do something\r\nviolent.”\r\n\r\nMlle. Michonneau rose to her feet.\r\n\r\n“She is going!--She is not going!--She is going!--No, she isn’t.”\r\n\r\nThese alternate exclamations, and a suggestion of hostile intentions,\r\nborne out by the behavior of the insurgents, compelled Mlle. Michonneau\r\nto take her departure. She made some stipulations, speaking in a low\r\nvoice in her hostess’ ear, and then--“I shall go to Mme. Buneaud’s,” she\r\nsaid, with a threatening look.\r\n\r\n“Go where you please, mademoiselle,” said Mme. Vauquer, who regarded\r\nthis choice of an opposition establishment as an atrocious insult. “Go\r\nand lodge with the Buneaud; the wine would give a cat the colic, and the\r\nfood is cheap and nasty.”\r\n\r\nThe boarders stood aside in two rows to let her pass; not a word was\r\nspoken. Poiret looked so wistfully after Mlle. Michonneau, and so\r\nartlessly revealed that he was in two minds whether to go or stay, that\r\nthe boarders, in their joy at being quit of Mlle. Michonneau, burst out\r\nlaughing at the sight of him.\r\n\r\n“Hist!--st!--st! Poiret,” shouted the painter. “Hallo! I say, Poiret,\r\nhallo!” The _employe_ from the Museum began to sing:\r\n\r\n     “Partant pour la Syrie,\r\n      Le jeune et beau Dunois...”\r\n\r\n“Get along with you; you must be dying to go, _trahit sua quemque\r\nvoluptas!_” said Bianchon.\r\n\r\n“Every one to his taste--free rendering from Virgil,” said the tutor.\r\n\r\nMlle. Michonneau made a movement as if to take Poiret’s arm, with an\r\nappealing glance that he could not resist. The two went out together,\r\nthe old maid leaning upon him, and there was a burst of applause,\r\nfollowed by peals of laughter.\r\n\r\n“Bravo, Poiret!”\r\n\r\n“Who would have thought it of old Poiret!”\r\n\r\n“Apollo Poiret!”\r\n\r\n“Mars Poiret!”\r\n\r\n“Intrepid Poiret!”\r\n\r\nA messenger came in at that moment with a letter for Mme. Vauquer, who\r\nread it through, and collapsed in her chair.\r\n\r\n“The house might as well be burned down at once,” cried she, “if there\r\nare to be any more of these thunderbolts! Young Taillefer died at three\r\no’clock this afternoon. It serves me right for wishing well to those\r\nladies at that poor man’s expense. Mme. Couture and Victorine want me\r\nto send their things, because they are going to live with her father.\r\nM. Taillefer allows his daughter to keep old Mme. Couture as her lady\r\ncompanion. Four rooms to let! and five lodgers gone!...”\r\n\r\nShe sat up, and seemed about to burst into tears.\r\n\r\n“Bad luck has come to lodge here, I think,” she cried.\r\n\r\nOnce more there came a sound of wheels from the street outside.\r\n\r\n“What! another windfall for somebody!” was Sylvie’s comment.\r\n\r\nBut it was Goriot who came in, looking so radiant, so flushed with\r\nhappiness, that he seemed to have grown young again.\r\n\r\n“Goriot in a cab!” cried the boarders; “the world is coming to an end.”\r\n\r\nThe good soul made straight for Eugene, who was standing wrapped in\r\nthought in a corner, and laid a hand on the young man’s arm.\r\n\r\n“Come,” he said, with gladness in his eyes.\r\n\r\n“Then you haven’t heard the news?” said Eugene. “Vautrin was an escaped\r\nconvict; they have just arrested him; and young Taillefer is dead.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, but what business is it of ours?” replied Father Goriot. “I\r\nam going to dine with my daughter in _your house_, do you understand?\r\nShe is expecting you. Come!”\r\n\r\nHe carried off Rastignac with him by main force, and they departed in as\r\ngreat a hurry as a pair of eloping lovers.\r\n\r\n“Now, let us have dinner,” cried the painter, and every one drew his\r\nchair to the table.\r\n\r\n“Well, I never,” said the portly Sylvie. “Nothing goes right to-day! The\r\nharicot mutton has caught! Bah! you will have to eat it, burned as it\r\nis, more’s the pity!”\r\n\r\nMme. Vauquer was so dispirited that she could not say a word as she\r\nlooked round the table and saw only ten people where eighteen should\r\nbe; but every one tried to comfort and cheer her. At first the dinner\r\ncontingent, as was natural, talked about Vautrin and the day’s events;\r\nbut the conversation wound round to such topics of interest as duels,\r\njails, justice, prison life, and alterations that ought to be made\r\nin the laws. They soon wandered miles away from Jacques Collin and\r\nVictorine and her brother. There might be only ten of them, but they\r\nmade noise enough for twenty; indeed, there seemed to be more of them\r\nthan usual; that was the only difference between yesterday and to-day.\r\nIndifference to the fate of others is a matter of course in this selfish\r\nworld, which, on the morrow of tragedy, seeks among the events of\r\nParis for a fresh sensation for its daily renewed appetite, and this\r\nindifference soon gained the upper hand. Mme. Vauquer herself grew\r\ncalmer under the soothing influence of hope, and the mouthpiece of hope\r\nwas the portly Sylvie.\r\n\r\nThat day had gone by like a dream for Eugene, and the sense of unreality\r\nlasted into the evening; so that, in spite of his energetic character\r\nand clear-headedness, his ideas were a chaos as he sat beside Goriot in\r\nthe cab. The old man’s voice was full of unwonted happiness, but Eugene\r\nhad been shaken by so many emotions that the words sounded in his ears\r\nlike words spoken in a dream.\r\n\r\n“It was finished this morning! All three of us are going to dine\r\nthere together, together! Do you understand? I have not dined with my\r\nDelphine, my little Delphine, these four years, and I shall have her\r\nfor a whole evening! We have been at your lodging the whole time since\r\nmorning. I have been working like a porter in my shirt sleeves, helping\r\nto carry in the furniture. Aha! you don’t know what pretty ways she\r\nhas; at table she will look after me, ‘Here, papa, just try this, it is\r\nnice.’ And I shall not be able to eat. Oh, it is a long while since I\r\nhave been with her in quiet every-day life as we shall have her.”\r\n\r\n“It really seems as if the world has been turned upside down.”\r\n\r\n“Upside down?” repeated Father Goriot. “Why, the world has never been so\r\nright-side up. I see none but smiling faces in the streets, people who\r\nshake hands cordially and embrace each other, people who all look as\r\nhappy as if they were going to dine with their daughter, and gobble down\r\na nice little dinner that she went with me to order of the chef at the\r\nCafe des Anglais. But, pshaw! with her beside you gall and wormwood\r\nwould be as sweet as honey.”\r\n\r\n“I feel as if I were coming back to life again,” said Eugene.\r\n\r\n“Why, hurry up there!” cried Father Goriot, letting down the window in\r\nfront. “Get on faster; I will give you five francs if you get to the\r\nplace I told you of in ten minutes time.”\r\n\r\nWith this prospect before him the cabman crossed Paris with miraculous\r\ncelerity.\r\n\r\n“How that fellow crawls!” said Father Goriot.\r\n\r\n“But where are you taking me?” Eugene asked him.\r\n\r\n“To your own house,” said Goriot.\r\n\r\nThe cab stopped in the Rue d’Artois. Father Goriot stepped out first and\r\nflung ten francs to the man with the recklessness of a widower returning\r\nto bachelor ways.\r\n\r\n“Come along upstairs,” he said to Rastignac. They crossed a courtyard,\r\nand climbed up to the third floor of a new and handsome house. There\r\nthey stopped before a door; but before Goriot could ring, it was opened\r\nby Therese, Mme. de Nucingen’s maid. Eugene found himself in a charming\r\nset of chambers; an ante-room, a little drawing-room, a bedroom, and a\r\nstudy, looking out upon a garden. The furniture and the decorations of\r\nthe little drawing-room were of the most daintily charming description,\r\nthe room was full of soft light, and Delphine rose up from a low chair\r\nby the fire and stood before him. She set her fire-screen down on the\r\nchimney-piece, and spoke with tenderness in every tone of her voice.\r\n\r\n“So we had to go in search of you, sir, you who are so slow to\r\nunderstand!”\r\n\r\nTherese left the room. The student took Delphine in his arms and held\r\nher in a tight clasp, his eyes filled with tears of joy. This last\r\ncontrast between his present surroundings and the scenes he had just\r\nwitnessed was too much for Rastignac’s over-wrought nerves, after the\r\nday’s strain and excitement that had wearied heart and brain; he was\r\nalmost overcome by it.\r\n\r\n“I felt sure myself that he loved you,” murmured Father Goriot, while\r\nEugene lay back bewildered on the sofa, utterly unable to speak a word\r\nor to reason out how and why the magic wand had been waved to bring\r\nabout this final transformation scene.\r\n\r\n“But you must see your rooms,” said Mme. de Nucingen. She took his hand\r\nand led him into a room carpeted and furnished like her own; indeed,\r\ndown to the smallest details, it was a reproduction in miniature of\r\nDelphine’s apartment.\r\n\r\n“There is no bed,” said Rastignac.\r\n\r\n“No, monsieur,” she answered, reddening, and pressing his hand. Eugene,\r\nlooking at her, understood, young though he yet was, how deeply modesty\r\nis implanted in the heart of a woman who loves.\r\n\r\n“You are one of those beings whom we cannot choose but to adore for\r\never,” he said in her ear. “Yes, the deeper and truer love is, the more\r\nmysterious and closely veiled it should be; I can dare to say so, since\r\nwe understand each other so well. No one shall learn our secret.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! so I am nobody, I suppose,” growled the father.\r\n\r\n“You know quite well that ‘we’ means you.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! that is what I wanted. You will not mind me, will you? I shall go\r\nand come like a good fairy who makes himself felt everywhere without\r\nbeing seen, shall I not? Eh, Delphinette, Ninette, Dedel--was it not a\r\ngood idea of mine to say to you, ‘There are some nice rooms to let in\r\nthe Rue d’Artois; let us furnish them for him?’ And she would not hear\r\nof it! Ah! your happiness has been all my doing. I am the author of your\r\nhappiness and of your existence. Fathers must always be giving if they\r\nwould be happy themselves; always giving--they would not be fathers\r\nelse.”\r\n\r\n“Was that how it happened?” asked Eugene.\r\n\r\n“Yes. She would not listen to me. She was afraid that people would\r\ntalk, as if the rubbish that they say about you were to be compared with\r\nhappiness! Why, all women dream of doing what she has done----”\r\n\r\nFather Goriot found himself without an audience, for Mme. de Nucingen\r\nhad led Rastignac into the study; he heard a kiss given and taken, low\r\nthough the sound was.\r\n\r\nThe study was furnished as elegantly as the other rooms, and nothing was\r\nwanting there.\r\n\r\n“Have we guessed your wishes rightly?” she asked, as they returned to\r\nthe drawing-room for dinner.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said, “only too well, alas! For all this luxury so well\r\ncarried out, this realization of pleasant dreams, the elegance that\r\nsatisfies all the romantic fancies of youth, appeals to me so strongly\r\nthat I cannot but feel that it is my rightful possession, but I cannot\r\naccept it from you, and I am too poor as yet to----”\r\n\r\n“Ah! ah! you say me nay already,” she said with arch imperiousness,\r\nand a charming little pout of the lips, a woman’s way of laughing away\r\nscruples.\r\n\r\nBut Eugene had submitted so lately to that solemn self-questioning, and\r\nVautrin’s arrest had so plainly shown him the depths of the pit that lay\r\nready to his feet, that the instincts of generosity and honor had been\r\nstrengthened in him, and he could not allow himself to be coaxed into\r\nabandoning his high-minded determinations. Profound melancholy filled\r\nhis mind.\r\n\r\n“Do you really mean to refuse?” said Mme. de Nucingen. “And do you know\r\nwhat such a refusal means? That you are not sure of yourself, that you\r\ndo not dare to bind yourself to me. Are you really afraid of betraying\r\nmy affection? If you love me, if I--love you, why should you shrink back\r\nfrom such a slight obligation? If you but knew what a pleasure it has\r\nbeen to see after all the arrangements of this bachelor establishment,\r\nyou would not hesitate any longer, you would ask me to forgive you for\r\nyour hesitation. I had some money that belonged to you, and I have made\r\ngood use of it, that is all. You mean this for magnanimity, but it is\r\nvery little of you. You are asking me for far more than this.... Ah!”\r\n she cried, as Eugene’s passionate glance was turned on her, “and you are\r\nmaking difficulties about the merest trifles. Of, if you feel no love\r\nwhatever for me, refuse, by all means. My fate hangs on a word from you.\r\nSpeak!--Father,” she said after a pause, “make him listen to reason. Can\r\nhe imagine that I am less nice than he is on the point of honor?”\r\n\r\nFather Goriot was looking on and listening to this pretty quarrel with a\r\nplacid smile, as if he had found some balm for all the sorrows of life.\r\n\r\n“Child that you are!” she cried again, catching Eugene’s hand. “You are\r\njust beginning life; you find barriers at the outset that many a man\r\nfinds insurmountable; a woman’s hand opens the way and you shrink back!\r\nWhy, you are sure to succeed! You will have a brilliant future. Success\r\nis written on that broad forehead of yours, and will you not be able to\r\nrepay me my loan of to-day? Did not a lady in olden times arm her knight\r\nwith sword and helmet and coat of mail, and find him a charger, so that\r\nhe might fight for her in the tournament? Well, then, Eugene, these\r\nthings that I offer you are the weapons of this age; every one who\r\nmeans to be something must have such tools as these. A pretty place your\r\ngarret must be if it is like papa’s room! See, dinner is waiting all\r\nthis time. Do you want to make me unhappy?--Why don’t you answer?” she\r\nsaid, shaking his hand. “_Mon Dieu!_ papa, make up his mind for him, or\r\nI will go away and never see him any more.”\r\n\r\n“I will make up your mind,” said Goriot, coming down from the clouds.\r\n“Now, my dear M. Eugene, the next thing is to borrow money of the Jews,\r\nisn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“There is positively no help for it,” said Eugene.\r\n\r\n“All right, I will give you credit,” said the other, drawing out a cheap\r\nleather pocket-book, much the worse for wear. “I have turned Jew myself;\r\nI paid for everything; here are the invoices. You do not owe a penny\r\nfor anything here. It did not come to very much--five thousand francs at\r\nmost, and I am going to lend you the money myself. I am not a woman--you\r\ncan refuse me. You shall give me a receipt on a scrap of paper, and you\r\ncan return it some time or other.”\r\n\r\nDelphine and Eugene looked at each other in amazement, tears sprang to\r\ntheir eyes. Rastignac held out his hand and grasped Goriot’s warmly.\r\n\r\n“Well, what is all this about? Are you not my children?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! my poor father,” said Mme. de Nucingen, “how did you do it?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! now you ask me. When I made up my mind to move him nearer to you,\r\nand saw you buying things as if they were wedding presents, I said to\r\nmyself, ‘She will never be able to pay for them.’ The attorney says that\r\nthose law proceedings will last quite six months before your husband can\r\nbe made to disgorge your fortune. Well and good. I sold out my property\r\nin the funds that brought in thirteen hundred and fifty livres a year,\r\nand bought a safe annuity of twelve hundred francs a year for fifteen\r\nthousand francs. Then I paid your tradesmen out of the rest of the\r\ncapital. As for me, children, I have a room upstairs for which I pay\r\nfifty crowns a year; I can live like a prince on two francs a day, and\r\nstill have something left over. I shall not have to spend anything much\r\non clothes, for I never wear anything out. This fortnight past I have\r\nbeen laughing in my sleeve, thinking to myself, ‘How happy they are\r\ngoing to be!’ and--well, now, are you not happy?”\r\n\r\n“Oh papa! papa!” cried Mme. de Nucingen, springing to her father, who\r\ntook her on his knee. She covered him with kisses, her fair hair brushed\r\nhis cheek, her tears fell on the withered face that had grown so bright\r\nand radiant.\r\n\r\n“Dear father, what a father you are! No, there is not another father\r\nlike you under the sun. If Eugene loved you before, what must he feel\r\nfor you now?”\r\n\r\n“Why, children, why Delphinette!” cried Goriot, who had not felt his\r\ndaughter’s heart beat against his breast for ten years, “do you want me\r\nto die of joy? My poor heart will break! Come, Monsieur Eugene, we are\r\nquits already.” And the old man strained her to his breast with such\r\nfierce and passionate force that she cried out.\r\n\r\n“Oh! you are hurting me!” she said.\r\n\r\n“I am hurting you!” He grew pale at the words. The pain expressed in his\r\nface seemed greater than it is given to humanity to know. The agony of\r\nthis Christ of paternity can only be compared with the masterpieces of\r\nthose princes of the palette who have left for us the record of their\r\nvisions of an agony suffered for a whole world by the Saviour of men.\r\nFather Goriot pressed his lips very gently against the waist than his\r\nfingers had grasped too roughly.\r\n\r\n“Oh! no, no,” he cried. “I have not hurt you, have I?” and his smile\r\nseemed to repeat the question. “YOU have hurt me with that cry just\r\nnow.--The things cost rather more than that,” he said in her ear, with\r\nanother gentle kiss, “but I had to deceive him about it, or he would\r\nhave been angry.”\r\n\r\nEugene sat dumb with amazement in the presence of this inexhaustible\r\nlove; he gazed at Goriot, and his face betrayed the artless admiration\r\nwhich shapes the beliefs of youth.\r\n\r\n“I will be worthy of all this,” he cried.\r\n\r\n“Oh! my Eugene, that is nobly said,” and Mme. de Nucingen kissed the law\r\nstudent on the forehead.\r\n\r\n“He gave up Mlle. Taillefer and her millions for you,” said Father\r\nGoriot. “Yes, the little thing was in love with you, and now that her\r\nbrother is dead she is as rich as Croesus.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! why did you tell her?” cried Rastignac.\r\n\r\n“Eugene,” Delphine said in his ear, “I have one regret now this evening.\r\nAh! how I will love you! and for ever!”\r\n\r\n“This is the happiest day I have had since you two were married!” cried\r\nGoriot. “God may send me any suffering, so long as I do not suffer\r\nthrough you, and I can still say, ‘In this short month of February I had\r\nmore happiness than other men have in their whole lives.’--Look at me,\r\nFifine!” he said to his daughter. “She is very beautiful, is she not?\r\nTell me, now, have you seen many women with that pretty soft color--that\r\nlittle dimple of hers? No, I thought not. Ah, well, and but for me this\r\nlovely woman would never have been. And very soon happiness will make\r\nher a thousand times lovelier, happiness through you. I could give up\r\nmy place in heaven to you, neighbor, if needs be, and go down to hell\r\ninstead. Come, let us have dinner,” he added, scarcely knowing what he\r\nsaid, “everything is ours.”\r\n\r\n“Poor dear father!”\r\n\r\nHe rose and went over to her, and took her face in his hands, and set a\r\nkiss on the plaits of hair. “If you only knew, little one, how happy you\r\ncan make me--how little it takes to make me happy! Will you come and see\r\nme sometimes? I shall be just above, so it is only a step. Promise me,\r\nsay that you will!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, dear father.”\r\n\r\n“Say it again.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I will, my kind father.”\r\n\r\n“Hush! hush! I should make you say it a hundred times over if I followed\r\nmy own wishes. Let us have dinner.”\r\n\r\nThe three behaved like children that evening, and Father Goriot’s\r\nspirits were certainly not the least wild. He lay at his daughter’s\r\nfeet, kissed them, gazed into her eyes, rubbed his head against her\r\ndress; in short, no young lover could have been more extravagant or more\r\ntender.\r\n\r\n“You see!” Delphine said with a look at Eugene, “so long as my father is\r\nwith us, he monopolizes me. He will be rather in the way sometimes.”\r\n\r\nEugene had himself already felt certain twinges of jealousy, and could\r\nnot blame this speech that contained the germ of all ingratitude.\r\n\r\n“And when will the rooms be ready?” asked Eugene, looking round. “We\r\nmust all leave them this evening, I suppose.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but to-morrow you must come and dine with me,” she answered, with\r\nan eloquent glance. “It is our night at the Italiens.”\r\n\r\n“I shall go to the pit,” said her father.\r\n\r\nIt was midnight. Mme. de Nucingen’s carriage was waiting for her, and\r\nFather Goriot and the student walked back to the Maison Vauquer, talking\r\nof Delphine, and warming over their talk till there grew up a curious\r\nrivalry between the two violent passions. Eugene could not help seeing\r\nthat the father’s self-less love was deeper and more steadfast than\r\nhis own. For this worshiper Delphine was always pure and fair, and her\r\nfather’s adoration drew its fervor from a whole past as well as a future\r\nof love.\r\n\r\nThey found Mme. Vauquer by the stove, with Sylvie and Christophe to keep\r\nher company; the old landlady, sitting like Marius among the ruins of\r\nCarthage, was waiting for the two lodgers that yet remained to her, and\r\nbemoaning her lot with the sympathetic Sylvie. Tasso’s lamentations as\r\nrecorded in Byron’s poem are undoubtedly eloquent, but for sheer force\r\nof truth they fall far short of the widow’s cry from the depths.\r\n\r\n“Only three cups of coffee in the morning, Sylvie! Oh dear! to have your\r\nhouse emptied in this way is enough to break your heart. What is life,\r\nnow my lodgers are gone? Nothing at all. Just think of it! It is just as\r\nif all the furniture had been taken out of the house, and your furniture\r\nis your life. How have I offended heaven to draw down all this trouble\r\nupon me? And haricot beans and potatoes laid in for twenty people!\r\nThe police in my house too! We shall have to live on potatoes now, and\r\nChristophe will have to go!”\r\n\r\nThe Savoyard, who was fast asleep, suddenly woke up at this, and said,\r\n“Madame,” questioningly.\r\n\r\n“Poor fellow!” said Sylvie, “he is like a dog.”\r\n\r\n“In the dead season, too! Nobody is moving now. I would like to know\r\nwhere the lodgers are to drop down from. It drives me distracted. And\r\nthat old witch of a Michonneau goes and takes Poiret with her! What can\r\nshe have done to make him so fond of her? He runs about after her like a\r\nlittle dog.”\r\n\r\n“Lord!” said Sylvie, flinging up her head, “those old maids are up to\r\nall sorts of tricks.”\r\n\r\n“There’s that poor M. Vautrin that they made out to be a convict,” the\r\nwidow went on. “Well, you know that is too much for me, Sylvie; I\r\ncan’t bring myself to believe it. Such a lively man as he was, and paid\r\nfifteen francs a month for his coffee of an evening, paid you very penny\r\non the nail too.”\r\n\r\n“And open-handed he was!” said Christophe.\r\n\r\n“There is some mistake,” said Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“Why, no there isn’t! he said so himself!” said Mme. Vauquer. “And to\r\nthink that all these things have happened in my house, and in a quarter\r\nwhere you never see a cat go by. On my word as an honest woman, it’s\r\nlike a dream. For, look here, we saw Louis XVI. meet with his mishap;\r\nwe saw the fall of the Emperor; and we saw him come back and fall again;\r\nthere was nothing out of the way in all that, but lodging-houses are not\r\nliable to revolutions. You can do without a king, but you must eat all\r\nthe same; and so long as a decent woman, a de Conflans born and bred,\r\nwill give you all sorts of good things for dinner, nothing short of the\r\nend of the world ought to--but there, it is the end of the world, that\r\nis just what it is!”\r\n\r\n“And to think that Mlle. Michonneau who made all this mischief is to\r\nhave a thousand crowns a year for it, so I hear,” cried Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“Don’t speak of her, she is a wicked woman!” said Mme. Vauquer. “She\r\nis going to the Buneaud, who charges less than cost. But the Buneaud\r\nis capable of anything; she must have done frightful things, robbed\r\nand murdered people in her time. _She_ ought to be put in jail for life\r\ninstead of that poor dear----”\r\n\r\nEugene and Goriot rang the door-bell at that moment.\r\n\r\n“Ah! here are my two faithful lodgers,” said the widow, sighing.\r\n\r\nBut the two faithful lodgers, who retained but shadowy recollections\r\nof the misfortunes of their lodging-house, announced to their hostess\r\nwithout more ado that they were about to remove to the Chaussee d’Antin.\r\n\r\n“Sylvie!” cried the widow, “this is the last straw.--Gentlemen, this\r\nwill be the death of me! It has quite upset me! There’s a weight on my\r\nchest! I am ten years older for this day! Upon my word, I shall go out\r\nof my senses! And what is to be done with the haricots!--Oh, well, if\r\nI am to be left here all by myself, you shall go to-morrow,\r\nChristophe.--Good-night, gentlemen,” and she went.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter now?” Eugene inquired of Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“Lord! everybody is going about his business, and that has addled her\r\nwits. There! she is crying upstairs. It will do her good to snivel a\r\nbit. It’s the first time she has cried since I’ve been with her.”\r\n\r\nBy the morning, Mme. Vauquer, to use her own expression, had “made up\r\nher mind to it.” True, she still wore a doleful countenance, as might\r\nbe expected of a woman who had lost all her lodgers, and whose manner\r\nof life had been suddenly revolutionized, but she had all her wits about\r\nher. Her grief was genuine and profound; it was real pain of mind, for\r\nher purse had suffered, the routine of her existence had been broken. A\r\nlover’s farewell glance at his lady-love’s window is not more mournful\r\nthan Mme. Vauquer’s survey of the empty places round her table. Eugene\r\nadministered comfort, telling the widow that Bianchon, whose term of\r\nresidence at the hospital was about to expire, would doubtless take\r\nhis (Rastignac’s) place; that the official from the Museum had often\r\nexpressed a desire to have Mme. Couture’s rooms; and that in a very few\r\ndays her household would be on the old footing.\r\n\r\n“God send it may, my dear sir! but bad luck has come to lodge here.\r\nThere’ll be a death in the house before ten days are out, you’ll see,”\r\n and she gave a lugubrious look round the dining-room. “Whose turn will\r\nit be, I wonder?”\r\n\r\n“It is just as well that we are moving out,” said Eugene to Father\r\nGoriot in a low voice.\r\n\r\n“Madame,” said Sylvie, running in with a scared face, “I have not seen\r\nMistigris these three days.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! well, if my cat is dead, if _he_ has gone and left us, I----”\r\n\r\nThe poor woman could not finish her sentence; she clasped her hands\r\nand hid her face on the back of her armchair, quite overcome by this\r\ndreadful portent.\r\n\r\nBy twelve o’clock, when the postman reaches that quarter, Eugene\r\nreceived a letter. The dainty envelope bore the Beauseant arms on the\r\nseal, and contained an invitation to the Vicomtesse’s great ball, which\r\nhad been talked of in Paris for a month. A little note for Eugene was\r\nslipped in with the card.\r\n\r\n\r\n “I think, monsieur, that you will undertake with pleasure to\r\n  interpret my sentiments to Mme. de Nucingen, so I am sending the\r\n  card for which you asked me to you. I shall be delighted to make\r\n  the acquaintance of Mme. de Restaud’s sister. Pray introduce that\r\n  charming lady to me, and do not let her monopolize all your\r\n  affection, for you owe me not a little in return for mine.\r\n\r\n                                         “VICOMTESSE DE BEAUSEANT.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Eugene to himself, as he read the note a second time, “Mme.\r\nde Beauseant says pretty plainly that she does not want the Baron de\r\nNucingen.”\r\n\r\nHe went to Delphine at once in his joy. He had procured this pleasure\r\nfor her, and doubtless he would receive the price of it. Mme. de\r\nNucingen was dressing. Rastignac waited in her boudoir, enduring as best\r\nhe might the natural impatience of an eager temperament for the reward\r\ndesired and withheld for a year. Such sensations are only known once\r\nin a life. The first woman to whom a man is drawn, if she is really\r\na woman--that is to say, if she appears to him amid the splendid\r\naccessories that form a necessary background to life in the world of\r\nParis--will never have a rival.\r\n\r\nLove in Paris is a thing distinct and apart; for in Paris neither men\r\nnor women are the dupes of the commonplaces by which people seek to\r\nthrow a veil over their motives, or to parade a fine affectation of\r\ndisinterestedness in their sentiments. In this country within a country,\r\nit is not merely required of a woman that she should satisfy the senses\r\nand the soul; she knows perfectly well that she has still greater\r\nobligations to discharge, that she must fulfil the countless demands\r\nof a vanity that enters into every fibre of that living organism called\r\nsociety. Love, for her, is above all things, and by its very nature, a\r\nvainglorious, brazen-fronted, ostentatious, thriftless charlatan. If\r\nat the Court of Louis XIV. there was not a woman but envied Mlle. de la\r\nValliere the reckless devotion of passion that led the grand monarch to\r\ntear the priceless ruffles at his wrists in order to assist the entry of\r\na Duc de Vermandois into the world--what can you expect of the rest\r\nof society? You must have youth and wealth and rank; nay, you must, if\r\npossible, have more than these, for the more incense you bring with you\r\nto burn at the shrine of the god, the more favorably will he regard the\r\nworshiper. Love is a religion, and his cult must in the nature of things\r\nbe more costly than those of all other deities; Love the Spoiler stays\r\nfor a moment, and then passes on; like the urchin of the streets, his\r\ncourse may be traced by the ravages that he has made. The wealth of\r\nfeeling and imagination is the poetry of the garret; how should love\r\nexist there without that wealth?\r\n\r\nIf there are exceptions who do not subscribe to these Draconian laws of\r\nthe Parisian code, they are solitary examples. Such souls live so far\r\nout of the main current that they are not borne away by the doctrines\r\nof society; they dwell beside some clear spring of everflowing water,\r\nwithout seeking to leave the green shade; happy to listen to the echoes\r\nof the infinite in everything around them and in their own souls,\r\nwaiting in patience to take their flight for heaven, while they look\r\nwith pity upon those of earth.\r\n\r\nRastignac, like most young men who have been early impressed by the\r\ncircumstances of power and grandeur, meant to enter the lists fully\r\narmed; the burning ambition of conquest possessed him already; perhaps\r\nhe was conscious of his powers, but as yet he knew neither the end to\r\nwhich his ambition was to be directed, nor the means of attaining it.\r\nIn default of the pure and sacred love that fills a life, ambition\r\nmay become something very noble, subduing to itself every thought of\r\npersonal interest, and setting as the end--the greatness, not of one\r\nman, but of a whole nation.\r\n\r\nBut the student had not yet reached the time of life when a man surveys\r\nthe whole course of existence and judges it soberly. Hitherto he had\r\nscarcely so much as shaken off the spell of the fresh and gracious\r\ninfluences that envelop a childhood in the country, like green leaves\r\nand grass. He had hesitated on the brink of the Parisian Rubicon, and\r\nin spite of the prickings of ambition, he still clung to a lingering\r\ntradition of an old ideal--the peaceful life of the noble in his\r\nchateau. But yesterday evening, at the sight of his rooms, those\r\nscruples had vanished. He had learned what it was to enjoy the material\r\nadvantages of fortune, as he had already enjoyed the social advantages\r\nof birth; he ceased to be a provincial from that moment, and slipped\r\nnaturally and easily into a position which opened up a prospect of a\r\nbrilliant future.\r\n\r\nSo, as he waited for Delphine, in the pretty boudoir, where he felt\r\nthat he had a certain right to be, he felt himself so far away from the\r\nRastignac who came back to Paris a year ago, that, turning some power of\r\ninner vision upon this latter, he asked himself whether that past self\r\nbore any resemblance to the Rastignac of that moment.\r\n\r\n“Madame is in her room,” Therese came to tell him. The woman’s voice\r\nmade him start.\r\n\r\nHe found Delphine lying back in her low chair by the fireside, looking\r\nfresh and bright. The sight of her among the flowing draperies of muslin\r\nsuggested some beautiful tropical flower, where the fruit is set amid\r\nthe blossom.\r\n\r\n“Well,” she said, with a tremor in her voice, “here you are.”\r\n\r\n“Guess what I bring for you,” said Eugene, sitting down beside her. He\r\ntook possession of her arm to kiss her hand.\r\n\r\nMme. de Nucingen gave a joyful start as she saw the card. She turned\r\nto Eugene; there were tears in her eyes as she flung her arms about his\r\nneck, and drew him towards her in a frenzy of gratified vanity.\r\n\r\n“And I owe this happiness to you--to _thee_” (she whispered the more\r\nintimate word in his ear); “but Therese is in my dressing-room, let us\r\nbe prudent.--This happiness--yes, for I may call it so, when it comes\r\nto me through _you_--is surely more than a triumph for self-love? No one\r\nhas been willing to introduce me into that set. Perhaps just now I may\r\nseem to you to be frivolous, petty, shallow, like a Parisienne, but\r\nremember, my friend, that I am ready to give up all for you; and that if\r\nI long more than ever for an entrance into the Faubourg Saint-Germain,\r\nit is because I shall meet you there.”\r\n\r\n“Mme. de Beauseant’s note seems to say very plainly that she does not\r\nexpect to see the _Baron_ de Nucingen at her ball; don’t you think so?”\r\n said Eugene.\r\n\r\n“Why, yes,” said the Baroness as she returned the letter. “Those women\r\nhave a talent for insolence. But it is of no consequence, I shall go.\r\nMy sister is sure to be there, and sure to be very beautifully\r\ndressed.--Eugene,” she went on, lowering her voice, “she will go to\r\ndispel ugly suspicions. You do not know the things that people are\r\nsaying about her. Only this morning Nucingen came to tell me that they\r\nhad been discussing her at the club. Great heavens! on what does a\r\nwoman’s character and the honor of a whole family depend! I feel that\r\nI am nearly touched and wounded in my poor sister. According to some\r\npeople, M. de Trailles must have put his name to bills for a hundred\r\nthousand francs, nearly all of them are overdue, and proceedings are\r\nthreatened. In this predicament, it seems that my sister sold her\r\ndiamonds to a Jew--the beautiful diamonds that belonged to her husband’s\r\nmother, Mme. de Restaud the elder,--you have seen her wearing them. In\r\nfact, nothing else has been talked about for the last two days. So I can\r\nsee that Anastasie is sure to come to Mme. de Beauseant’s ball in tissue\r\nof gold, and ablaze with diamonds, to draw all eyes upon her; and I will\r\nnot be outshone. She has tried to eclipse me all her life, she has never\r\nbeen kind to me, and I have helped her so often, and always had money\r\nfor her when she had none.--But never mind other people now, to-day I\r\nmean to be perfectly happy.”\r\n\r\nAt one o’clock that morning Eugene was still with Mme. de Nucingen. In\r\nthe midst of their lovers’ farewell, a farewell full of hope of bliss to\r\ncome, she said in a troubled voice, “I am very fearful, superstitious.\r\nGive what name you like to my presentiments, but I am afraid that my\r\nhappiness will be paid for by some horrible catastrophe.”\r\n\r\n“Child!” said Eugene.\r\n\r\n“Ah! have we changed places, and am I the child to-night?” she asked,\r\nlaughingly.\r\n\r\nEugene went back to the Maison Vauquer, never doubting but that he\r\nshould leave it for good on the morrow; and on the way he fell to\r\ndreaming the bright dreams of youth, when the cup of happiness has left\r\nits sweetness on the lips.\r\n\r\n“Well?” cried Goriot, as Rastignac passed by his door.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Eugene; “I will tell you everything to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“Everything, will you not?” cried the old man. “Go to bed. To-morrow our\r\nhappy life will begin.”\r\n\r\nNext day, Goriot and Rastignac were ready to leave the lodging-house,\r\nand only awaited the good pleasure of a porter to move out of it;\r\nbut towards noon there was a sound of wheels in the Rue\r\nNeuve-Sainte-Genevieve, and a carriage stopped before the door of the\r\nMaison Vauquer. Mme. de Nucingen alighted, and asked if her father was\r\nstill in the house, and, receiving an affirmative reply from Sylvie, ran\r\nlightly upstairs.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that Eugene was at home all unknown to his neighbor. At\r\nbreakfast time he had asked Goriot to superintend the removal of\r\nhis goods, saying that he would meet him in the Rue d’Artois at four\r\no’clock; but Rastignac’s name had been called early on the list at\r\nthe Ecole de Droit, and he had gone back at once to the Rue\r\nNueve-Sainte-Genevieve. No one had seen him come in, for Goriot had gone\r\nto find a porter, and the mistress of the house was likewise out. Eugene\r\nhad thought to pay her himself, for it struck him that if he left this,\r\nGoriot in his zeal would probably pay for him. As it was, Eugene went\r\nup to his room to see that nothing had been forgotten, and blessed his\r\nforesight when he saw the blank bill bearing Vautrin’s signature lying\r\nin the drawer where he had carelessly thrown it on the day when he had\r\nrepaid the amount. There was no fire in the grate, so he was about to\r\ntear it into little pieces, when he heard a voice speaking in Goriot’s\r\nroom, and the speaker was Delphine! He made no more noise, and stood\r\nstill to listen, thinking that she should have no secrets from him;\r\nbut after the first few words, the conversation between the father\r\nand daughter was so strange and interesting that it absorbed all his\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n“Ah! thank heaven that you thought of asking him to give an account of\r\nthe money settled on me before I was utterly ruined, father. Is it safe\r\nto talk?” she added.\r\n\r\n“Yes, there is no one in the house,” said her father faintly.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter with you?” asked Mme. de Nucingen.\r\n\r\n“God forgive you! you have just dealt me a staggering blow, child!” said\r\nthe old man. “You cannot know how much I love you, or you would not have\r\nburst in upon me like this, with such news, especially if all is not\r\nlost. Has something so important happened that you must come here about\r\nit? In a few minutes we should have been in the Rue d’Artois.”\r\n\r\n“Eh! does one think what one is doing after a catastrophe? It has turned\r\nmy head. Your attorney has found out the state of things now, but it\r\nwas bound to come out sooner or later. We shall want your long business\r\nexperience; and I come to you like a drowning man who catches at a\r\nbranch. When M. Derville found that Nucingen was throwing all sorts of\r\ndifficulties in his way, he threatened him with proceedings, and told\r\nhim plainly that he would soon obtain an order from the President of the\r\nTribunal. So Nucingen came to my room this morning, and asked if I meant\r\nto ruin us both. I told him that I knew nothing whatever about it, that\r\nI had a fortune, and ought to be put into possession of my fortune, and\r\nthat my attorney was acting for me in the matter; I said again that I\r\nknew absolutely nothing about it, and could not possibly go into the\r\nsubject with him. Wasn’t that what you told me to tell him?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, quite right,” answered Goriot.\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” Delphine continued, “he told me all about his affairs.\r\nHe had just invested all his capital and mine in business speculations;\r\nthey have only just been started, and very large sums of money are\r\nlocked up. If I were to compel him to refund my dowry now, he would be\r\nforced to file his petition; but if I will wait a year, he undertakes,\r\non his honor, to double or treble my fortune, by investing it in\r\nbuilding land, and I shall be mistress at last of the whole of my\r\nproperty. He was speaking the truth, father dear; he frightened me! He\r\nasked my pardon for his conduct; he has given me my liberty; I am free\r\nto act as I please on condition that I leave him to carry on my business\r\nin my name. To prove his sincerity, he promised that M. Derville might\r\ninspect the accounts as often as I pleased, so that I might be assured\r\nthat everything was being conducted properly. In short, he put himself\r\nin my power, bound hand and foot. He wishes the present arrangements\r\nas to the expenses of housekeeping to continue for two more years, and\r\nentreated me not to exceed my allowance. He showed me plainly that it\r\nwas all that he could do to keep up appearances; he has broken with his\r\nopera dancer; he will be compelled to practise the most strict economy\r\n(in secret) if he is to bide his time with unshaken credit. I scolded, I\r\ndid all I could to drive him to desperation, so as to find out more. He\r\nshowed me his ledgers--he broke down and cried at last. I never saw\r\na man in such a state. He lost his head completely, talked of killing\r\nhimself, and raved till I felt quite sorry for him.”\r\n\r\n“Do you really believe that silly rubbish?”... cried her father. “It was\r\nall got up for your benefit! I have had to do with Germans in the way\r\nof business, honest and straightforward they are pretty sure to be, but\r\nwhen with their simplicity and frankness they are sharpers and humbugs\r\nas well, they are the worst rogues of all. Your husband is taking\r\nadvantage of you. As soon as pressure is brought to bear on him he shams\r\ndead; he means to be more the master under your name than in his own. He\r\nwill take advantage of the position to secure himself against the risks\r\nof business. He is as sharp as he is treacherous; he is a bad lot! No,\r\nno; I am not going to leave my girls behind me without a penny when I go\r\nto Pere-Lachaise. I know something about business still. He has sunk\r\nhis money in speculation, he says; very well then, there is something to\r\nshow for it--bills, receipts, papers of some sort. Let him produce them,\r\nand come to an arrangement with you. We will choose the most promising\r\nof his speculations, take them over at our own risk, and have the\r\nsecurities transferred into your name; they shall represent the separate\r\nestate of Delphine Goriot, wife of the Baron de Nucingen. Does that\r\nfellow really take us for idiots? Does he imagine that I could stand\r\nthe idea of your being without fortune, without bread, for forty-eight\r\nhours? I would not stand it a day--no, not a night, not a couple of\r\nhours! If there had been any foundation for the idea, I should never get\r\nover it. What! I have worked hard for forty years, carried sacks on\r\nmy back, and sweated and pinched and saved all my life for you, my\r\ndarlings, for you who made the toil and every burden borne for you seem\r\nlight; and now, my fortune, my whole life, is to vanish in smoke! I\r\nshould die raving mad if I believed a word of it. By all that’s holiest\r\nin heaven and earth, we will have this cleared up at once; go through\r\nthe books, have the whole business looked thoroughly into! I will not\r\nsleep, nor rest, nor eat until I have satisfied myself that all your\r\nfortune is in existence. Your money is settled upon you, God be thanked!\r\nand, luckily, your attorney, Maitre Derville, is an honest man. Good\r\nLord! you shall have your snug little million, your fifty thousand\r\nfrancs a year, as long as you live, or I will raise a racket in Paris, I\r\nwill so! If the Tribunals put upon us, I will appeal to the Chambers.\r\nIf I knew that you were well and comfortably off as far as money is\r\nconcerned, that thought would keep me easy in spite of bad health and\r\ntroubles. Money? why, it is life! Money does everything. That great dolt\r\nof an Alsatian shall sing to another tune! Look here, Delphine, don’t\r\ngive way, don’t make a concession of half a quarter of a farthing to\r\nthat fathead, who has ground you down and made you miserable. If he\r\ncan’t do without you, we will give him a good cudgeling, and keep him\r\nin order. Great heavens! my brain is on fire; it is as if there were\r\nsomething redhot inside my head. My Delphine lying on straw! You! my\r\nFifine! Good gracious! Where are my gloves? Come, let us go at once;\r\nI mean to see everything with my own eyes--books, cash, and\r\ncorrespondence, the whole business. I shall have no peace until I know\r\nfor certain that your fortune is secure.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! father dear, be careful how you set about it! If there is the least\r\nhint of vengeance in the business, if you show yourself openly hostile,\r\nit will be all over with me. He knows whom he has to deal with; he\r\nthinks it quite natural that if you put the idea into my head, I should\r\nbe uneasy about my money; but I swear to you that he has it in his own\r\nhands, and that he had meant to keep it. He is just the man to abscond\r\nwith all the money and leave us in the lurch, the scoundrel! He knows\r\nquite well that I will not dishonor the name I bear by bringing him into\r\na court of law. His position is strong and weak at the same time. If we\r\ndrive him to despair, I am lost.”\r\n\r\n“Why, then, the man is a rogue?”\r\n\r\n“Well, yes, father,” she said, flinging herself into a chair, “I wanted\r\nto keep it from you to spare your feelings,” and she burst into tears;\r\n“I did not want you to know that you had married me to such a man as\r\nhe is. He is just the same in private life--body and soul and\r\nconscience--the same through and through--hideous! I hate him; I despise\r\nhim! Yes, after all that that despicable Nucingen has told me, I cannot\r\nrespect him any longer. A man capable of mixing himself up in such\r\naffairs, and of talking about them to me as he did, without the\r\nslightest scruple,--it is because I have read him through and through\r\nthat I am afraid of him. He, my husband, frankly proposed to give me my\r\nliberty, and do you know what that means? It means that if things\r\nturn out badly for him, I am to play into his hands, and be his\r\nstalking-horse.”\r\n\r\n“But there is law to be had! There is a Place de Greve for sons-in-law\r\nof that sort,” cried her father; “why, I would guillotine him myself if\r\nthere was no headsman to do it.”\r\n\r\n“No, father, the law cannot touch him. Listen, this is what he says,\r\nstripped of all his circumlocutions--‘Take your choice, you and no one\r\nelse can be my accomplice; either everything is lost, you are ruined\r\nand have not a farthing, or you will let me carry this business through\r\nmyself.’ Is that plain speaking? He _must_ have my assistance. He is\r\nassured that his wife will deal fairly by him; he knows that I shall\r\nleave his money to him and be content with my own. It is an unholy and\r\ndishonest compact, and he holds out threats of ruin to compel me to\r\nconsent to it. He is buying my conscience, and the price is liberty to\r\nbe Eugene’s wife in all but name. ‘I connive at your errors, and you\r\nallow me to commit crimes and ruin poor families!’ Is that sufficiently\r\nexplicit? Do you know what he means by speculations? He buys up land in\r\nhis own name, then he finds men of straw to run up houses upon it. These\r\nmen make a bargain with a contractor to build the houses, paying them by\r\nbills at long dates; then in consideration of a small sum they leave\r\nmy husband in possession of the houses, and finally slip through the\r\nfingers of the deluded contractors by going into bankruptcy. The name of\r\nthe firm of Nucingen has been used to dazzle the poor contractors. I saw\r\nthat. I noticed, too, that Nucingen had sent bills for large amounts to\r\nAmsterdam, London, Naples, and Vienna, in order to prove if necessary\r\nthat large sums had been paid away by the firm. How could we get\r\npossession of those bills?”\r\n\r\nEugene heard a dull thud on the floor; Father Goriot must have fallen on\r\nhis knees.\r\n\r\n“Great heavens! what have I done to you? Bound my daughter to this\r\nscoundrel who does as he likes with her!--Oh! my child, my child!\r\nforgive me!” cried the old man.\r\n\r\n“Yes, if I am in the depths of despair, perhaps you are to blame,” said\r\nDelphine. “We have so little sense when we marry! What do we know of the\r\nworld, of business, or men, or life? Our fathers should think for us!\r\nFather dear, I am not blaming you in the least, forgive me for what\r\nI said. This is all my own fault. Nay, do not cry, papa,” she said,\r\nkissing him.\r\n\r\n“Do not cry either, my little Delphine. Look up and let me kiss away\r\nthe tears. There! I shall find my wits and unravel this skein of your\r\nhusband’s winding.”\r\n\r\n“No, let me do that; I shall be able to manage him. He is fond of me,\r\nwell and good; I shall use my influence to make him invest my money as\r\nsoon as possible in landed property in my own name. Very likely I could\r\nget him to buy back Nucingen in Alsace in my name; that has always been\r\na pet idea of his. Still, come to-morrow and go through the books, and\r\nlook into the business. M. Derville knows little of mercantile matters.\r\nNo, not to-morrow though. I do not want to be upset. Mme. de Beauseant’s\r\nball will be the day after to-morrow, and I must keep quiet, so as to\r\nlook my best and freshest, and do honor to my dear Eugene!... Come, let\r\nus see his room.”\r\n\r\nBut as she spoke a carriage stopped in the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve,\r\nand the sound of Mme. de Restaud’s voice came from the staircase. “Is my\r\nfather in?” she asked of Sylvie.\r\n\r\nThis accident was luckily timed for Eugene, whose one idea had been to\r\nthrow himself down on the bed and pretend to be asleep.\r\n\r\n“Oh, father, have you heard about Anastasie?” said Delphine, when she\r\nheard her sister speak. “It looks as though some strange things had\r\nhappened in that family.”\r\n\r\n“What sort of things?” asked Goriot. “This is like to be the death of\r\nme. My poor head will not stand a double misfortune.”\r\n\r\n“Good-morning, father,” said the Countess from the threshold. “Oh!\r\nDelphine, are you here?”\r\n\r\nMme. de Restaud seemed taken aback by her sister’s presence.\r\n\r\n“Good-morning, Nasie,” said the Baroness. “What is there so\r\nextraordinary in my being here? _I_ see our father every day.”\r\n\r\n“Since when?”\r\n\r\n“If you came yourself you would know.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t tease, Delphine,” said the Countess fretfully. “I am very\r\nmiserable, I am lost. Oh! my poor father, it is hopeless this time!”\r\n\r\n“What is it, Nasie?” cried Goriot. “Tell us all about it, child! How\r\nwhite she is! Quick, do something, Delphine; be kind to her, and I will\r\nlove you even better, if that were possible.”\r\n\r\n“Poor Nasie!” said Mme. de Nucingen, drawing her sister to a chair. “We\r\nare the only two people in the world whose love is always sufficient to\r\nforgive you everything. Family affection is the surest, you see.”\r\n\r\nThe Countess inhaled the salts and revived.\r\n\r\n“This will kill me!” said their father. “There,” he went on, stirring\r\nthe smouldering fire, “come nearer, both of you. It is cold. What is it,\r\nNasie? Be quick and tell me, this is enough to----”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, my husband knows everything,” said the Countess. “Just\r\nimagine it; do you remember, father, that bill of Maxime’s some time\r\nago? Well, that was not the first. I had paid ever so many before that.\r\nAbout the beginning of January M. de Trailles seemed very much troubled.\r\nHe said nothing to me; but it is so easy to read the hearts of those you\r\nlove, a mere trifle is enough; and then you feel things instinctively.\r\nIndeed, he was more tender and affectionate than ever, and I was happier\r\nthan I had ever been before. Poor Maxime! in himself he was really\r\nsaying good-bye to me, so he has told me since; he meant to blow his\r\nbrains out! At last I worried him so, and begged and implored so hard;\r\nfor two hours I knelt at his knees and prayed and entreated, and at last\r\nhe told me--that he owed a hundred thousand francs. Oh! papa! a hundred\r\nthousand francs! I was beside myself! You had not the money, I knew, I\r\nhad eaten up all that you had----”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Goriot; “I could not have got it for you unless I had stolen\r\nit. But I would have done that for you, Nasie! I will do it yet.”\r\n\r\nThe words came from him like a sob, a hoarse sound like the death\r\nrattle of a dying man; it seemed indeed like the agony of death when\r\nthe father’s love was powerless. There was a pause, and neither of the\r\nsisters spoke. It must have been selfishness indeed that could hear\r\nunmoved that cry of anguish that, like a pebble thrown over a precipice,\r\nrevealed the depths of his despair.\r\n\r\n“I found the money, father, by selling what was not mine to sell,” and\r\nthe Countess burst into tears.\r\n\r\nDelphine was touched; she laid her head on her sister’s shoulder, and\r\ncried too.\r\n\r\n“Then it is all true,” she said.\r\n\r\nAnastasie bowed her head, Mme. de Nucingen flung her arms about her,\r\nkissed her tenderly, and held her sister to her heart.\r\n\r\n“I shall always love you and never judge you, Nasie,” she said.\r\n\r\n“My angels,” murmured Goriot faintly. “Oh, why should it be trouble that\r\ndraws you together?”\r\n\r\nThis warm and palpitating affection seemed to give the Countess courage.\r\n\r\n“To save Maxime’s life,” she said, “to save all my own happiness, I\r\nwent to the money-lender you know of, a man of iron forged in hell-fire;\r\nnothing can melt him; I took all the family diamonds that M. de Restaud\r\nis so proud of--his and mine too--and sold them to that M. Gobseck.\r\n_Sold them!_ Do you understand? I saved Maxime, but I am lost. Restaud\r\nfound it all out.”\r\n\r\n“How? Who told him? I will kill him,” cried Goriot.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday he sent to tell me to come to his room. I went. ...\r\n‘Anastasie,’ he said in a voice--oh! such a voice; that was enough, it\r\ntold me everything--‘where are your diamonds?’--‘In my room----’--‘No,’\r\nhe said, looking straight at me, ‘there they are on that chest of\r\ndrawers----’ and he lifted his handkerchief and showed me the casket.\r\n‘Do you know where they came from?’ he said. I fell at his feet.... I\r\ncried; I besought him to tell me the death he wished to see me die.”\r\n\r\n“You said that!” cried Goriot. “By God in heaven, whoever lays a hand on\r\neither of you so long as I am alive may reckon on being roasted by slow\r\nfires! Yes, I will cut him in pieces like...”\r\n\r\nGoriot stopped; the words died away in his throat.\r\n\r\n“And then, dear, he asked something worse than death of me. Oh! heaven\r\npreserve all other women from hearing such words as I heard then!”\r\n\r\n“I will murder that man,” said Goriot quietly. “But he has only one\r\nlife, and he deserves to die twice.--And then, what next?” he added,\r\nlooking at Anastasie.\r\n\r\n“Then,” the Countess resumed, “there was a pause, and he looked at me.\r\n‘Anastasie,’ he said, ‘I will bury this in silence; there shall be no\r\nseparation; there are the children. I will not kill M. de Trailles. I\r\nmight miss him if we fought, and as for other ways of getting rid of\r\nhim, I should come into collision with the law. If I killed him in your\r\narms, it would bring dishonor on _those_ children. But if you do not\r\nwant to see your children perish, nor their father nor me, you must\r\nfirst of all submit to two conditions. Answer me. Have I a child of my\r\nown?’ I answered, ‘Yes,’--‘Which?’--‘Ernest, our eldest boy.’--‘Very\r\nwell,’ he said, ‘and now swear to obey me in this particular from this\r\ntime forward.’ I swore. ‘You will make over your property to me when I\r\nrequire you to do so.’”\r\n\r\n“Do nothing of the kind!” cried Goriot. “Aha! M. de Restaud, you could\r\nnot make your wife happy; she has looked for happiness and found it\r\nelsewhere, and you make her suffer for your own ineptitude? He will have\r\nto reckon with me. Make yourself easy, Nasie. Aha! he cares about his\r\nheir! Good, very good. I will get hold of the boy; isn’t he my grandson?\r\nWhat the blazes! I can surely go to see the brat! I will stow him away\r\nsomewhere; I will take care of him, you may be quite easy. I will bring\r\nRestaud to terms, the monster! I shall say to him, ‘A word or two with\r\nyou! If you want your son back again, give my daughter her property, and\r\nleave her to do as she pleases.’”\r\n\r\n“Father!”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I am your father, Nasie, a father indeed! That rogue of a great\r\nlord had better not ill-treat my daughter. _Tonnerre!_ What is it in my\r\nveins? There is the blood of a tiger in me; I could tear those two men\r\nto pieces! Oh! children, children! so this is what your lives are! Why,\r\nit is death!... What will become of you when I shall be here no longer?\r\nFathers ought to live as long as their children. Ah! Lord God in heaven!\r\nhow ill Thy world is ordered! Thou hast a Son, if what they tell us\r\nis true, and yet Thou leavest us to suffer so through our children. My\r\ndarlings, my darlings! to think that trouble only should bring you to\r\nme, that I should only see you with tears on your faces! Ah! yes, yes,\r\nyou love me, I see that you love me. Come to me and pour out your griefs\r\nto me; my heart is large enough to hold them all. Oh! you might rend my\r\nheart in pieces, and every fragment would make a father’s heart. If only\r\nI could bear all your sorrows for you! ... Ah! you were so happy when\r\nyou were little and still with me....”\r\n\r\n“We have never been happy since,” said Delphine. “Where are the old days\r\nwhen we slid down the sacks in the great granary?”\r\n\r\n“That is not all, father,” said Anastasie in Goriot’s ear. The old man\r\ngave a startled shudder. “The diamonds only sold for a hundred thousand\r\nfrancs. Maxime is hard pressed. There are twelve thousand francs still\r\nto pay. He has given me his word that he will be steady and give up play\r\nin future. His love is all that I have left in the world. I have paid\r\nsuch a fearful price for it that I should die if I lose him now. I have\r\nsacrificed my fortune, my honor, my peace of mind, and my children for\r\nhim. Oh! do something, so that at the least Maxime may be at large and\r\nlive undisgraced in the world, where he will assuredly make a career for\r\nhimself. Something more than my happiness is at stake; the children have\r\nnothing, and if he is sent to Sainte-Pelagie all his prospects will be\r\nruined.”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t the money, Nasie. I have _nothing_--nothing left. This is\r\nthe end of everything. Yes, the world is crumbling into ruin, I am sure.\r\nFly! Save yourselves! Ah!--I have still my silver buckles left, and\r\nhalf-a-dozen silver spoons and forks, the first I ever had in my\r\nlife. But I have nothing else except my life annuity, twelve hundred\r\nfrancs...”\r\n\r\n“Then what has become of your money in the funds?”\r\n\r\n“I sold out, and only kept a trifle for my wants. I wanted twelve\r\nthousand francs to furnish some rooms for Delphine.”\r\n\r\n“In your own house?” asked Mme. de Restaud, looking at her sister.\r\n\r\n“What does it matter where they were?” asked Goriot. “The money is spent\r\nnow.”\r\n\r\n“I see how it is,” said the Countess. “Rooms for M. de Rastignac. Poor\r\nDelphine, take warning by me!”\r\n\r\n“M. de Rastignac is incapable of ruining the woman he loves, dear.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks! Delphine. I thought you would have been kinder to me in my\r\ntroubles, but you never did love me.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, she loves you, Nasie,” cried Goriot; “she was saying so only\r\njust now. We were talking about you, and she insisted that you were\r\nbeautiful, and that she herself was only pretty!”\r\n\r\n“Pretty!” said the Countess. “She is as hard as a marble statue.”\r\n\r\n“And if I am?” cried Delphine, flushing up, “how have you treated me?\r\nYou would not recognize me; you closed the doors of every house against\r\nme; you have never let an opportunity of mortifying me slip by. And\r\nwhen did I come, as you were always doing, to drain our poor father, a\r\nthousand francs at a time, till he is left as you see him now? That\r\nis all your doing, sister! I myself have seen my father as often as I\r\ncould. I have not turned him out of the house, and then come and fawned\r\nupon him when I wanted money. I did not so much as know that he had\r\nspent those twelve thousand francs on me. I am economical, as you know;\r\nand when papa has made me presents, it has never been because I came and\r\nbegged for them.”\r\n\r\n“You were better off than I. M. de Marsay was rich, as you have reason\r\nto know. You always were as slippery as gold. Good-bye; I have neither\r\nsister nor----”\r\n\r\n“Oh! hush, hush, Nasie!” cried her father.\r\n\r\n“Nobody else would repeat what everybody has ceased to believe. You are\r\nan unnatural sister!” cried Delphine.\r\n\r\n“Oh, children, children! hush! hush! or I will kill myself before your\r\neyes.”\r\n\r\n“There, Nasie, I forgive you,” said Mme. de Nucingen; “you are very\r\nunhappy. But I am kinder than you are. How could you say _that_ just\r\nwhen I was ready to do anything in the world to help you, even to be\r\nreconciled with my husband, which for my own sake I----Oh! it is just\r\nlike you; you have behaved cruelly to me all through these nine years.”\r\n\r\n“Children, children, kiss each other!” cried the father. “You are\r\nangels, both of you.”\r\n\r\n“No. Let me alone,” cried the Countess shaking off the hand that her\r\nfather had laid on her arm. “She is more merciless than my husband. Any\r\none might think she was a model of all the virtues herself!”\r\n\r\n“I would rather have people think that I owed money to M. de Marsay\r\nthan own that M. de Trailles had cost me more than two hundred thousand\r\nfrancs,” retorted Mme. de Nucingen.\r\n\r\n“_Delphine!_” cried the Countess, stepping towards her sister.\r\n\r\n“I shall tell you the truth about yourself if you begin to slander me,”\r\n said the Baroness coldly.\r\n\r\n“Delphine! you are a ----”\r\n\r\nFather Goriot sprang between them, grasped the Countess’ hand, and laid\r\nhis own over her mouth.\r\n\r\n“Good heavens, father! What have you been handling this morning?” said\r\nAnastasie.\r\n\r\n“Ah! well, yes, I ought not to have touched you,” said the poor father,\r\nwiping his hands on his trousers, “but I have been packing up my things;\r\nI did not know that you were coming to see me.”\r\n\r\nHe was glad that he had drawn down her wrath upon himself.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” he sighed, as he sat down, “you children have broken my heart\r\nbetween you. This is killing me. My head feels as if it were on fire.\r\nBe good to each other and love each other! This will be the death of\r\nme! Delphine! Nasie! come, be sensible; you are both in the wrong. Come,\r\nDedel,” he added, looking through his tears at the Baroness, “she must\r\nhave twelve thousand francs, you see; let us see if we can find them for\r\nher. Oh, my girls, do not look at each other like that!” and he sank on\r\nhis knees beside Delphine. “Ask her to forgive you--just to please\r\nme,” he said in her ear. “She is more miserable than you are. Come now,\r\nDedel.”\r\n\r\n“Poor Nasie!” said Delphine, alarmed at the wild extravagant grief in\r\nher father’s face, “I was in the wrong, kiss me----”\r\n\r\n“Ah! that is like balm to my heart,” cried Father Goriot. “But how are\r\nwe to find twelve thousand francs? I might offer myself as a substitute\r\nin the army----”\r\n\r\n“Oh! father dear!” they both cried, flinging their arms about him. “No,\r\nno!”\r\n\r\n“God reward you for the thought. We are not worth it, are we, Nasie?”\r\n asked Delphine.\r\n\r\n“And besides, father dear, it would only be a drop in the bucket,”\r\n observed the Countess.\r\n\r\n“But is flesh and blood worth nothing?” cried the old man in his\r\ndespair. “I would give body and soul to save you, Nasie. I would do a\r\nmurder for the man who would rescue you. I would do, as Vautrin did, go\r\nto the hulks, go----” he stopped as if struck by a thunderbolt, and put\r\nboth hands to his head. “Nothing left!” he cried, tearing his hair. “If\r\nI only knew of a way to steal money, but it is so hard to do it, and\r\nthen you can’t set to work by yourself, and it takes time to rob a bank.\r\nYes, it is time I was dead; there is nothing left me to do but to die. I\r\nam no good in the world; I am no longer a father! No. She has come to me\r\nin her extremity, and, wretch that I am, I have nothing to give her. Ah!\r\nyou put your money into a life annuity, old scoundrel; and had you not\r\ndaughters? You did not love them. Die, die in a ditch, like the dog that\r\nyou are! Yes, I am worse than a dog; a beast would not have done as I\r\nhave done! Oh! my head... it throbs as if it would burst.”\r\n\r\n“Papa!” cried both the young women at once, “do, pray, be reasonable!”\r\n and they clung to him to prevent him from dashing his head against the\r\nwall. There was a sound of sobbing.\r\n\r\nEugene, greatly alarmed, took the bill that bore Vautrin’s signature,\r\nsaw that the stamp would suffice for a larger sum, altered the figures,\r\nmade it into a regular bill for twelve thousand francs, payable to\r\nGoriot’s order, and went to his neighbor’s room.\r\n\r\n“Here is the money, madame,” he said, handing the piece of paper to her.\r\n“I was asleep; your conversation awoke me, and by this means I learned\r\nall that I owed to M. Goriot. This bill can be discounted, and I shall\r\nmeet it punctually at the due date.”\r\n\r\nThe Countess stood motionless and speechless, but she held the bill in\r\nher fingers.\r\n\r\n“Delphine,” she said, with a white face, and her whole frame quivering\r\nwith indignation, anger, and rage, “I forgave you everything; God is my\r\nwitness that I forgave you, but I cannot forgive this! So this gentleman\r\nwas there all the time, and you knew it! Your petty spite has let you\r\nto wreak your vengeance on me by betraying my secrets, my life, my\r\nchildren’s lives, my shame, my honor! There, you are nothing to me any\r\nlonger. I hate you. I will do all that I can to injure you. I will...”\r\n\r\nAnger paralyzed her; the words died in her dry parched throat.\r\n\r\n“Why, he is my son, my child; he is your brother, your preserver!” cried\r\nGoriot. “Kiss his hand, Nasie! Stay, I will embrace him myself,” he\r\nsaid, straining Eugene to his breast in a frenzied clasp. “Oh my boy! I\r\nwill be more than a father to you; if I had God’s power, I would fling\r\nworlds at your feet. Why don’t you kiss him, Nasie? He is not a man, but\r\nan angel, a angel out of heaven.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind her, father; she is mad just now.”\r\n\r\n“Mad! am I? And what are you?” cried Mme. de Restaud.\r\n\r\n“Children, children, I shall die if you go on like this,” cried the\r\nold man, and he staggered and fell on the bed as if a bullet had struck\r\nhim.--“They are killing me between them,” he said to himself.\r\n\r\nThe Countess fixed her eyes on Eugene, who stood stock still; all his\r\nfaculties were numbed by this violent scene.\r\n\r\n“Sir?...” she said, doubt and inquiry in her face, tone, and bearing;\r\nshe took no notice now of her father nor of Delphine, who was hastily\r\nunfastening his waistcoat.\r\n\r\n“Madame,” said Eugene, answering the question before it was asked, “I\r\nwill meet the bill, and keep silence about it.”\r\n\r\n“You have killed our father, Nasie!” said Delphine, pointing to Goriot,\r\nwho lay unconscious on the bed. The Countess fled.\r\n\r\n“I freely forgive her,” said the old man, opening his eyes; “her\r\nposition is horrible; it would turn an older head than hers. Comfort\r\nNasie, and be nice to her, Delphine; promise it to your poor father\r\nbefore he dies,” he asked, holding Delphine’s hand in a convulsive\r\nclasp.\r\n\r\n“Oh! what ails you, father?” she cried in real alarm.\r\n\r\n“Nothing, nothing,” said Goriot; “it will go off. There is something\r\nheavy pressing on my forehead, a little headache.... Ah! poor Nasie,\r\nwhat a life lies before her!”\r\n\r\nJust as he spoke, the Countess came back again and flung herself on her\r\nknees before him. “Forgive me!” she cried.\r\n\r\n“Come,” said her father, “you are hurting me still more.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” the Countess said, turning to Rastignac, “misery made me\r\nunjust to you. You will be a brother to me, will you not?” and she held\r\nout her hand. Her eyes were full of tears as she spoke.\r\n\r\n“Nasie,” cried Delphine, flinging her arms round her sister, “my little\r\nNasie, let us forget and forgive.”\r\n\r\n“No, no,” cried Nasie; “I shall never forget!”\r\n\r\n“Dear angels,” cried Goriot, “it is as if a dark curtain over my eyes\r\nhad been raised; your voices have called me back to life. Kiss each\r\nother once more. Well, now, Nasie, that bill will save you, won’t it?”\r\n\r\n“I hope so. I say, papa, will you write your name on it?”\r\n\r\n“There! how stupid of me to forget that! But I am not feeling at all\r\nwell, Nasie, so you must not remember it against me. Send and let me\r\nknow as soon as you are out of your strait. No, I will go to you. No,\r\nafter all, I will not go; I might meet your husband, and I should kill\r\nhim on the spot. And as for signing away your property, I shall have\r\na word to say about that. Quick, my child, and keep Maxime in order in\r\nfuture.”\r\n\r\nEugene was too bewildered to speak.\r\n\r\n“Poor Anastasie, she always had a violent temper,” said Mme. de\r\nNucingen, “but she has a good heart.”\r\n\r\n“She came back for the endorsement,” said Eugene in Delphine’s ear.\r\n\r\n“Do you think so?”\r\n\r\n“I only wish I could think otherwise. Do not trust her,” he answered,\r\nraising his eyes as if he confided to heaven the thoughts that he did\r\nnot venture to express.\r\n\r\n“Yes. She is always acting a part to some extent.”\r\n\r\n“How do you feel now, dear Father Goriot?” asked Rastignac.\r\n\r\n“I should like to go to sleep,” he replied.\r\n\r\nEugene helped him to bed, and Delphine sat by the bedside, holding his\r\nhand until he fell asleep. Then she went.\r\n\r\n“This evening at the Italiens,” she said to Eugene, “and you can let me\r\nknow how he is. To-morrow you will leave this place, monsieur. Let us go\r\ninto your room.--Oh! how frightful!” she cried on the threshold. “Why,\r\nyou are even worse lodged than our father. Eugene, you have behaved\r\nwell. I would love you more if that were possible; but, dear boy, if you\r\nare to succeed in life, you must not begin by flinging twelve thousand\r\nfrancs out of the windows like that. The Comte de Trailles is a\r\nconfirmed gambler. My sister shuts her eyes to it. He would have made\r\nthe twelve thousand francs in the same way that he wins and loses heaps\r\nof gold.”\r\n\r\nA groan from the next room brought them back to Goriot’s bedside; to all\r\nappearances he was asleep, but the two lovers caught the words, “They\r\nare not happy!” Whether he was awake or sleeping, the tone in which they\r\nwere spoken went to his daughter’s heart. She stole up to the pallet-bed\r\non which her father lay, and kissed his forehead. He opened his eyes.\r\n\r\n“Ah! Delphine!” he said.\r\n\r\n“How are you now?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Quite comfortable. Do not worry about me; I shall get up presently.\r\nDon’t stay with me, children; go, go and be happy.”\r\n\r\nEugene went back with Delphine as far as her door; but he was not easy\r\nabout Goriot, and would not stay to dinner, as she proposed. He wanted\r\nto be back at the Maison Vauquer. Father Goriot had left his room,\r\nand was just sitting down to dinner as he came in. Bianchon had placed\r\nhimself where he could watch the old man carefully; and when the old\r\nvermicelli maker took up his square of bread and smelled it to find out\r\nthe quality of the flour, the medical student, studying him closely, saw\r\nthat the action was purely mechanical, and shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Just come and sit over here, hospitaller of Cochin,” said Eugene.\r\n\r\nBianchon went the more willingly because his change of place brought him\r\nnext to the old lodger.\r\n\r\n“What is wrong with him?” asked Rastignac.\r\n\r\n“It is all up with him, or I am much mistaken! Something very\r\nextraordinary must have taken place; he looks to me as if he were\r\nin imminent danger of serous apoplexy. The lower part of his face is\r\ncomposed enough, but the upper part is drawn and distorted. Then there\r\nis that peculiar look about the eyes that indicates an effusion of serum\r\nin the brain; they look as though they were covered with a film of fine\r\ndust, do you notice? I shall know more about it by to-morrow morning.”\r\n\r\n“Is there any cure for it?”\r\n\r\n“None. It might be possible to stave death off for a time if a way could\r\nbe found of setting up a reaction in the lower extremities; but if the\r\nsymptoms do not abate by to-morrow evening, it will be all over with\r\nhim, poor old fellow! Do you know what has happened to bring this on?\r\nThere must have been some violent shock, and his mind has given way.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, there was,” said Rastignac, remembering how the two daughters had\r\nstruck blow on blow at their father’s heart.\r\n\r\n“But Delphine at any rate loves her father,” he said to himself.\r\n\r\nThat evening at the opera Rastignac chose his words carefully, lest he\r\nshould give Mme. de Nucingen needless alarm.\r\n\r\n“Do not be anxious about him,” she said, however, as soon as Eugene\r\nbegan, “our father has really a strong constitution, but this morning\r\nwe gave him a shock. Our whole fortunes were in peril, so the thing was\r\nserious, you see. I could not live if your affection did not make me\r\ninsensible to troubles that I should once have thought too hard to bear.\r\nAt this moment I have but one fear left, but one misery to dread--to\r\nlose the love that has made me feel glad to live. Everything else is as\r\nnothing to me compared with our love; I care for nothing else, for you\r\nare all the world to me. If I feel glad to be rich, it is for your sake.\r\nTo my shame be it said, I think of my lover before my father. Do you ask\r\nwhy? I cannot tell you, but all my life is in you. My father gave me a\r\nheart, but you have taught it to beat. The whole world may condemn me;\r\nwhat does it matter if I stand acquitted in your eyes, for you have\r\nno right to think ill of me for the faults which a tyrannous love has\r\nforced me to commit for you! Do you think me an unnatural daughter? Oh!\r\nno, no one could help loving such a dear kind father as ours. But how\r\ncould I hide the inevitable consequences of our miserable marriages from\r\nhim? Why did he allow us to marry when we did? Was it not his duty to\r\nthink for us and foresee for us? To-day I know he suffers as much as we\r\ndo, but how can it be helped? And as for comforting him, we could not\r\ncomfort him in the least. Our resignation would give him more pain and\r\nhurt him far more than complaints and upbraidings. There are times in\r\nlife when everything turns to bitterness.”\r\n\r\nEugene was silent, the artless and sincere outpouring made an impression\r\non him.\r\n\r\nParisian women are often false, intoxicated with vanity, selfish and\r\nself-absorbed, frivolous and shallow; yet of all women, when they love,\r\nthey sacrifice their personal feelings to their passion; they rise but\r\nso much the higher for all the pettiness overcome in their nature, and\r\nbecome sublime. Then Eugene was struck by the profound discernment and\r\ninsight displayed by this woman in judging of natural affection, when a\r\nprivileged affection had separated and set her at a distance apart. Mme.\r\nde Nucingen was piqued by the silence,\r\n\r\n“What are you thinking about?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“I am thinking about what you said just now. Hitherto I have always felt\r\nsure that I cared far more for you than you did for me.”\r\n\r\nShe smiled, and would not give way to the happiness she felt, lest their\r\ntalk should exceed the conventional limits of propriety. She had never\r\nheard the vibrating tones of a sincere and youthful love; a few more\r\nwords, and she feared for her self-control.\r\n\r\n“Eugene,” she said, changing the conversation, “I wonder whether you\r\nknow what has been happening? All Paris will go to Mme. de Beauseant’s\r\nto-morrow. The Rochefides and the Marquis d’Ajuda have agreed to keep\r\nthe matter a profound secret, but to-morrow the king will sign the\r\nmarriage-contract, and your poor cousin the Vicomtesse knows nothing\r\nof it as yet. She cannot put off her ball, and the Marquis will not be\r\nthere. People are wondering what will happen?”\r\n\r\n“The world laughs at baseness and connives at it. But this will kill\r\nMme. de Beauseant.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no,” said Delphine, smiling, “you do not know that kind of woman.\r\nWhy, all Paris will be there, and so shall I; I ought to go there for\r\nyour sake.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps, after all, it is one of those absurd reports that people set\r\nin circulation here.”\r\n\r\n“We shall know the truth to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nEugene did not return to the Maison Vauquer. He could not forego the\r\npleasure of occupying his new rooms in the Rue d’Artois. Yesterday\r\nevening he had been obliged to leave Delphine soon after midnight, but\r\nthat night it was Delphine who stayed with him until two o’clock in the\r\nmorning. He rose late, and waited for Mme. de Nucingen, who came about\r\nnoon to breakfast with him. Youth snatches eagerly at these rosy moments\r\nof happiness, and Eugene had almost forgotten Goriot’s existence.\r\nThe pretty things that surrounded him were growing familiar; this\r\ndomestication in itself was one long festival for him, and Mme. de\r\nNucingen was there to glorify it all by her presence. It was four\r\no’clock before they thought of Goriot, and of how he had looked forward\r\nto the new life in that house. Eugene said that the old man ought to be\r\nmoved at once, lest he should grow too ill to move. He left Delphine\r\nand hurried back to the lodging-house. Neither Father Goriot nor young\r\nBianchon was in the dining-room with the others.\r\n\r\n“Aha!” said the painter as Eugene came in, “Father Goriot has broken\r\ndown at last. Bianchon is upstairs with him. One of his daughters--the\r\nComtesse de Restaurama--came to see the old gentleman, and he would get\r\nup and go out, and made himself worse. Society is about to lose one of\r\nits brightest ornaments.”\r\n\r\nRastignac sprang to the staircase.\r\n\r\n“Hey! Monsieur Eugene!”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Eugene, the mistress is calling you,” shouted Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“It is this, sir,” said the widow. “You and M. Goriot should by rights\r\nhave moved out on the 15th of February. That was three days ago; to-day\r\nis the 18th, I ought really to be paid a month in advance; but if you\r\nwill engage to pay for both, I shall be quite satisfied.”\r\n\r\n“Why can’t you trust him?”\r\n\r\n“Trust him, indeed! If the old gentleman went off his head and died,\r\nthose daughters of his would not pay me a farthing, and his things won’t\r\nfetch ten francs. This morning he went out with all the spoons and\r\nforks he has left, I don’t know why. He had got himself up to look quite\r\nyoung, and--Lord, forgive me--but I thought he had rouge on his cheeks;\r\nhe looked quite young again.”\r\n\r\n“I will be responsible,” said Eugene, shuddering with horror, for he\r\nforesaw the end.\r\n\r\nHe climbed the stairs and reached Father Goriot’s room. The old man was\r\ntossing on his bed. Bianchon was with him.\r\n\r\n“Good-evening, father,” said Eugene.\r\n\r\nThe old man turned his glassy eyes on him, smiled gently, and said:\r\n\r\n“How is _she_?”\r\n\r\n“She is quite well. But how are you?”\r\n\r\n“There is nothing much the matter.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t tire him,” said Bianchon, drawing Eugene into a corner of the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n“Well?” asked Rastignac.\r\n\r\n“Nothing but a miracle can save him now. Serous congestion has set in;\r\nI have put on mustard plasters, and luckily he can feel them, they are\r\nacting.”\r\n\r\n“Is it possible to move him?”\r\n\r\n“Quite out of the question. He must stay where he is, and be kept as\r\nquiet as possible----”\r\n\r\n“Dear Bianchon,” said Eugene, “we will nurse him between us.”\r\n\r\n“I have had the head physician round from my hospital to see him.”\r\n\r\n“And what did he say?”\r\n\r\n“He will give no opinion till to-morrow evening. He promised to look in\r\nagain at the end of the day. Unluckily, the preposterous creature must\r\nneeds go and do something foolish this morning; he will not say what it\r\nwas. He is as obstinate as a mule. As soon as I begin to talk to him\r\nhe pretends not to hear, and lies as if he were asleep instead of\r\nanswering, or if he opens his eyes he begins to groan. Some time this\r\nmorning he went out on foot in the streets, nobody knows where he went,\r\nand he took everything that he had of any value with him. He has been\r\ndriving some confounded bargain, and it has been too much for his\r\nstrength. One of his daughters has been here.”\r\n\r\n“Was it the Countess?” asked Eugene. “A tall, dark-haired woman, with\r\nlarge bright eyes, slender figure, and little feet?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Leave him to me for a bit,” said Rastignac. “I will make him confess;\r\nhe will tell me all about it.”\r\n\r\n“And meanwhile I will get my dinner. But try not to excite him; there is\r\nstill some hope left.”\r\n\r\n“All right.”\r\n\r\n“How they will enjoy themselves to-morrow,” said Father Goriot when they\r\nwere alone. “They are going to a grand ball.”\r\n\r\n“What were you doing this morning, papa, to make yourself so poorly this\r\nevening that you have to stop in bed?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Did not Anastasie come to see you?” demanded Rastignac.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Father Goriot.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, don’t keep anything from me. What more did she want of\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, she was very miserable,” he answered, gathering up all his strength\r\nto speak. “It was this way, my boy. Since that affair of the diamonds,\r\nNasie has not had a penny of her own. For this ball she had ordered a\r\ngolden gown like a setting for a jewel. Her mantuamaker, a woman without\r\na conscience, would not give her credit, so Nasie’s waiting-woman\r\nadvanced a thousand francs on account. Poor Nasie! reduced to such\r\nshifts! It cut me to the heart to think of it! But when Nasie’s maid\r\nsaw how things were between her master and mistress, she was afraid of\r\nlosing her money, and came to an understanding with the dressmaker, and\r\nthe woman refuses to send the ball-dress until the money is paid. The\r\ngown is ready, and the ball is to-morrow night! Nasie was in despair.\r\nShe wanted to borrow my forks and spoons to pawn them. Her husband is\r\ndetermined that she shall go and wear the diamonds, so as to contradict\r\nthe stories that are told all over Paris. How can she go to that\r\nheartless scoundrel and say, ‘I owe a thousand francs to my dressmaker;\r\npay her for me!’ She cannot. I saw that myself. Delphine will be there\r\ntoo in a superb toilette, and Anastasie ought not to be outshone by her\r\nyounger sister. And then--she was drowned in tears, poor girl! I felt\r\nso humbled yesterday when I had not the twelve thousand francs, that I\r\nwould have given the rest of my miserable life to wipe out that wrong.\r\nYou see, I could have borne anything once, but latterly this want of\r\nmoney has broken my heart. Oh! I did not do it by halves; I titivated\r\nmyself up a bit, and went out and sold my spoons and forks and buckles\r\nfor six hundred francs; then I went to old Daddy Gobseck, and sold a\r\nyear’s interest on my annuity for four hundred francs down. Pshaw! I can\r\nlive on dry bread, as I did when I was a young man; if I have done it\r\nbefore, I can do it again. My Nasie shall have one happy evening, at any\r\nrate. She shall be smart. The banknote for a thousand francs is under\r\nmy pillow; it warms me to have it lying there under my head, for it is\r\ngoing to make my poor Nasie happy. She can turn that bad girl Victoire\r\nout of the house. A servant that cannot trust her mistress, did any one\r\never hear the like! I shall be quite well to-morrow. Nasie is coming at\r\nten o’clock. They must not think that I am ill, or they will not go to\r\nthe ball; they will stop and take care of me. To-morrow Nasie will come\r\nand hold me in her arms as if I were one of her children; her kisses\r\nwill make me well again. After all, I might have spent the thousand\r\nfrancs on physic; I would far rather give them to my little Nasie, who\r\ncan charm all the pain away. At any rate, I am some comfort to her in\r\nher misery; and that makes up for my unkindness in buying an annuity.\r\nShe is in the depths, and I cannot draw her out of them now. Oh! I will\r\ngo into business again, I will buy wheat in Odessa; out there, wheat\r\nfetches a quarter of the price it sells for here. There is a law against\r\nthe importation of grain, but the good folk who made the law forgot to\r\nprohibit the introduction of wheat products and food stuffs made from\r\ncorn. Hey! hey!... That struck me this morning. There is a fine trade to\r\nbe done in starch.”\r\n\r\nEugene, watching the old man’s face, thought that his friend was\r\nlight-headed.\r\n\r\n“Come,” he said, “do not talk any more, you must rest----” Just then\r\nBianchon came up, and Eugene went down to dinner.\r\n\r\nThe two students sat up with him that night, relieving each other in\r\nturn. Bianchon brought up his medical books and studied; Eugene wrote\r\nletters home to his mother and sisters. Next morning Bianchon thought\r\nthe symptoms more hopeful, but the patient’s condition demanded\r\ncontinual attention, which the two students alone were willing to\r\ngive--a task impossible to describe in the squeamish phraseology of the\r\nepoch. Leeches must be applied to the wasted body, the poultices and\r\nhot foot-baths, and other details of the treatment required the physical\r\nstrength and devotion of the two young men. Mme. de Restaud did not\r\ncome; but she sent a messenger for the money.\r\n\r\n“I expected she would come herself; but it would have been a pity for\r\nher to come, she would have been anxious about me,” said the father, and\r\nto all appearances he was well content.\r\n\r\nAt seven o’clock that evening Therese came with a letter from Delphine.\r\n\r\n\r\n “What are you doing, dear friend? I have been loved for a very\r\n  little while, and I am neglected already? In the confidences of\r\n  heart and heart, I have learned to know your soul--you are too\r\n  noble not to be faithful for ever, for you know that love with all\r\n  its infinite subtle changes of feeling is never the same. Once you\r\n  said, as we were listening to the Prayer in _Mose in Egitto_, ‘For\r\n  some it is the monotony of a single note; for others, it is the\r\n  infinite of sound.’ Remember that I am expecting you this evening\r\n  to take me to Mme. de Beauseant’s ball. Every one knows now that\r\n  the King signed M. d’Ajuda’s marriage-contract this morning, and\r\n  the poor Vicomtesse knew nothing of it until two o’clock this\r\n  afternoon. All Paris will flock to her house, of course, just as a\r\n  crowd fills the Place de Greve to see an execution. It is\r\n  horrible, is it not, to go out of curiosity to see if she will\r\n  hide her anguish, and whether she will die courageously? I\r\n  certainly should not go, my friend, if I had been at her house\r\n  before; but, of course, she will not receive society any more\r\n  after this, and all my efforts would be in vain. My position is a\r\n  very unusual one, and besides, I am going there partly on your\r\n  account. I am waiting for you. If you are not beside me in less\r\n  than two hours, I do not know whether I could forgive such\r\n  treason.”\r\n\r\n\r\nRastignac took up a pen and wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n “I am waiting till the doctor comes to know if there is any hope of\r\n  your father’s life. He is lying dangerously ill. I will come and\r\n  bring you the news, but I am afraid it may be a sentence of death.\r\n  When I come you can decide whether you can go to the ball.--Yours\r\n  a thousand times.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAt half-past eight the doctor arrived. He did not take a very hopeful\r\nview of the case, but thought that there was no immediate danger.\r\nImprovements and relapses might be expected, and the good man’s life and\r\nreason hung in the balance.\r\n\r\n“It would be better for him to die at once,” the doctor said as he took\r\nleave.\r\n\r\nEugene left Goriot to Bianchon’s care, and went to carry the sad news to\r\nMme. de Nucingen. Family feeling lingered in her, and this must put an\r\nend for the present to her plans of amusement.\r\n\r\n“Tell her to enjoy her evening as if nothing had happened,” cried\r\nGoriot. He had been lying in a sort of stupor, but he suddenly sat\r\nupright as Eugene went out.\r\n\r\nEugene, half heartbroken, entered Delphine’s. Her hair had been dressed;\r\nshe wore her dancing slippers; she had only to put on her ball-dress;\r\nbut when the artist is giving the finishing stroke to his creation, the\r\nlast touches require more time than the whole groundwork of the picture.\r\n\r\n“Why, you are not dressed!” she cried.\r\n\r\n“Madame, your father----”\r\n\r\n“My father again!” she exclaimed, breaking in upon him. “You need not\r\nteach me what is due to my father, I have known my father this long\r\nwhile. Not a word, Eugene. I will hear what you have to say when you\r\nare dressed. My carriage is waiting, take it, go round to your rooms and\r\ndress, Therese has put out everything in readiness for you. Come back\r\nas soon as you can; we will talk about my father on the way to Mme. de\r\nBeauseant’s. We must go early; if we have to wait our turn in a row of\r\ncarriages, we shall be lucky if we get there by eleven o’clock.”\r\n\r\n“Madame----”\r\n\r\n“Quick! not a word!” she cried, darting into her dressing-room for a\r\nnecklace.\r\n\r\n“Do go, Monsieur Eugene, or you will vex madame,” said Therese, hurrying\r\nhim away; and Eugene was too horror-stricken by this elegant parricide\r\nto resist.\r\n\r\nHe went to his rooms and dressed, sad, thoughtful, and dispirited. The\r\nworld of Paris was like an ocean of mud for him just then; and it seemed\r\nthat whoever set foot in that black mire must needs sink into it up to\r\nthe chin.\r\n\r\n“Their crimes are paltry,” said Eugene to himself. “Vautrin was\r\ngreater.”\r\n\r\nHe had seen society in its three great phases--Obedience, Struggle,\r\nand Revolt; the Family, the World, and Vautrin; and he hesitated in his\r\nchoice. Obedience was dull, Revolt impossible, Struggle hazardous.\r\nHis thoughts wandered back to the home circle. He thought of the quiet\r\nuneventful life, the pure happiness of the days spent among those who\r\nloved him there. Those loving and beloved beings passed their lives in\r\nobedience to the natural laws of the hearth, and in that obedience found\r\na deep and constant serenity, unvexed by torments such as these. Yet,\r\nfor all his good impulses, he could not bring himself to make profession\r\nof the religion of pure souls to Delphine, nor to prescribe the duties\r\nof piety to her in the name of love. His education had begun to bear its\r\nfruits; he loved selfishly already. Besides, his tact had discovered to\r\nhim the real nature of Delphine; he divined instinctively that she was\r\ncapable of stepping over her father’s corpse to go to the ball; and\r\nwithin himself he felt that he had neither the strength of mind to play\r\nthe part of mentor, nor the strength of character to vex her, nor the\r\ncourage to leave her to go alone.\r\n\r\n“She would never forgive me for putting her in the wrong over it,” he\r\nsaid to himself. Then he turned the doctor’s dictum over in his mind;\r\nhe tried to believe that Goriot was not so dangerously ill as he had\r\nimagined, and ended by collecting together a sufficient quantity of\r\ntraitorous excuses for Delphine’s conduct. She did not know how ill her\r\nfather was; the kind old man himself would have made her go to the ball\r\nif she had gone to see him. So often it happens that this one or that\r\nstands condemned by the social laws that govern family relations;\r\nand yet there are peculiar circumstances in the case, differences of\r\ntemperament, divergent interests, innumerable complications of family\r\nlife that excuse the apparent offence.\r\n\r\nEugene did not wish to see too clearly; he was ready to sacrifice his\r\nconscience to his mistress. Within the last few days his whole life had\r\nundergone a change. Woman had entered into his world and thrown it into\r\nchaos, family claims dwindled away before her; she had appropriated\r\nall his being to her uses. Rastignac and Delphine found each other at\r\na crisis in their lives when their union gave them the most poignant\r\nbliss. Their passion, so long proved, had only gained in strength by the\r\ngratified desire that often extinguishes passion. This woman was his,\r\nand Eugene recognized that not until then had he loved her; perhaps love\r\nis only gratitude for pleasure. This woman, vile or sublime, he adored\r\nfor the pleasure she had brought as her dower; and Delphine loved\r\nRastignac as Tantalus would have loved some angel who had satisfied his\r\nhunger and quenched the burning thirst in his parched throat.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Mme. de Nucingen when he came back in evening dress, “how\r\nis my father?”\r\n\r\n“Very dangerously ill,” he answered; “if you will grant me a proof of\r\nyour affections, we will just go in to see him on the way.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” she said. “Yes, but afterwards. Dear Eugene, do be nice,\r\nand don’t preach to me. Come.”\r\n\r\nThey set out. Eugene said nothing for a while.\r\n\r\n“What is it now?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“I can hear the death-rattle in your father’s throat,” he said almost\r\nangrily. And with the hot indignation of youth, he told the story of\r\nMme. de Restaud’s vanity and cruelty, of her father’s final act of\r\nself-sacrifice, that had brought about this struggle between life\r\nand death, of the price that had been paid for Anastasie’s golden\r\nembroideries. Delphine cried.\r\n\r\n“I shall look frightful,” she thought. She dried her tears.\r\n\r\n“I will nurse my father; I will not leave his bedside,” she said aloud.\r\n\r\n“Ah! now you are as I would have you,” exclaimed Rastignac.\r\n\r\nThe lamps of five hundred carriages lit up the darkness about the Hotel\r\nde Beauseant. A gendarme in all the glory of his uniform stood on either\r\nside of the brightly lighted gateway. The great world was flocking\r\nthither that night in its eager curiosity to see the great lady at the\r\nmoment of her fall, and the rooms on the ground floor were already full\r\nto overflowing, when Mme. de Nucingen and Rastignac appeared. Never\r\nsince Louis XIV. tore her lover away from La grand Mademoiselle, and\r\nthe whole court hastened to visit that unfortunate princess, had a\r\ndisastrous love affair made such a sensation in Paris. But the youngest\r\ndaughter of the almost royal house of Burgundy had risen proudly above\r\nher pain, and moved till the last moment like a queen in this world--its\r\nvanities had always been valueless for her, save in so far as they\r\ncontributed to the triumph of her passion. The salons were filled with\r\nthe most beautiful women in Paris, resplendent in their toilettes, and\r\nradiant with smiles. Ministers and ambassadors, the most distinguished\r\nmen at court, men bedizened with decorations, stars, and ribbons, men\r\nwho bore the most illustrious names in France, had gathered about the\r\nVicomtesse.\r\n\r\nThe music of the orchestra vibrated in wave after wave of sound from the\r\ngolden ceiling of the palace, now made desolate for its queen.\r\n\r\nMadame de Beauseant stood at the door of the first salon to receive the\r\nguests who were styled her friends. She was dressed in white, and wore\r\nno ornament in the plaits of hair braided about her head; her face was\r\ncalm; there was no sign there of pride, nor of pain, nor of joy that\r\nshe did not feel. No one could read her soul; she stood there like some\r\nNiobe carved in marble. For a few intimate friends there was a tinge of\r\nsatire in her smile; but no scrutiny saw any change in her, nor had she\r\nlooked otherwise in the days of the glory of her happiness. The most\r\ncallous of her guests admired her as young Rome applauded some gladiator\r\nwho could die smiling. It seemed as if society had adorned itself for a\r\nlast audience of one of its sovereigns.\r\n\r\n“I was afraid that you would not come,” she said to Rastignac.\r\n\r\n“Madame,” he said, in an unsteady voice, taking her speech as a\r\nreproach, “I shall be the last to go, that is why I am here.”\r\n\r\n“Good,” she said, and she took his hand. “You are perhaps the only one\r\nI can trust here among all these. Oh, my friend, when you love, love\r\na woman whom you are sure that you can love always. Never forsake a\r\nwoman.”\r\n\r\nShe took Rastignac’s arm, and went towards a sofa in the card-room.\r\n\r\n“I want you to go to the Marquis,” she said. “Jacques, my footman, will\r\ngo with you; he has a letter that you will take. I am asking the Marquis\r\nto give my letters back to me. He will give them all up, I like to think\r\nthat. When you have my letters, go up to my room with them. Some one\r\nshall bring me word.”\r\n\r\nShe rose to go to meet the Duchesse de Langeais, her most intimate\r\nfriend, who had come like the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nRastignac went. He asked for the Marquis d’Ajuda at the Hotel Rochefide,\r\nfeeling certain that the latter would be spending his evening there, and\r\nso it proved. The Marquis went to his own house with Rastignac, and gave\r\na casket to the student, saying as he did so, “They are all there.”\r\n\r\nHe seemed as if he was about to say something to Eugene, to ask\r\nabout the ball, or the Vicomtesse; perhaps he was on the brink of\r\nthe confession that, even then, he was in despair, and knew that his\r\nmarriage had been a fatal mistake; but a proud gleam shone in his eyes,\r\nand with deplorable courage he kept his noblest feelings a secret.\r\n\r\n“Do not even mention my name to her, my dear Eugene.” He grasped\r\nRastignac’s hand sadly and affectionately, and turned away from him.\r\nEugene went back to the Hotel Beauseant, the servant took him to the\r\nVicomtesse’s room. There were signs there of preparations for a journey.\r\nHe sat down by the fire, fixed his eyes on the cedar wood casket, and\r\nfell into deep mournful musings. Mme. de Beauseant loomed large in these\r\nimaginings, like a goddess in the Iliad.\r\n\r\n“Ah! my friend!...” said the Vicomtesse; she crossed the room and laid\r\nher hand on Rastignac’s shoulder. He saw the tears in his cousin’s\r\nuplifted eyes, saw that one hand was raised to take the casket, and that\r\nthe fingers of the other trembled. Suddenly she took the casket, put it\r\nin the fire, and watched it burn.\r\n\r\n“They are dancing,” she said. “They all came very early; but death\r\nwill be long in coming. Hush! my friend,” and she laid a finger on\r\nRastignac’s lips, seeing that he was about to speak. “I shall never see\r\nParis again. I am taking my leave of the world. At five o’clock this\r\nmorning I shall set out on my journey; I mean to bury myself in the\r\nremotest part of Normandy. I have had very little time to make my\r\narrangements; since three o’clock this afternoon I have been busy\r\nsigning documents, setting my affairs in order; there was no one whom I\r\ncould send to...”\r\n\r\nShe broke off.\r\n\r\n“He was sure to be...”\r\n\r\nAgain she broke off; the weight of her sorrow was more than she could\r\nbear. In such moments as these everything is agony, and some words are\r\nimpossible to utter.\r\n\r\n“And so I counted upon you to do me this last piece of service\r\nthis evening,” she said. “I should like to give you some pledge of\r\nfriendship. I shall often think of you. You have seemed to me to be kind\r\nand noble, fresh-hearted and true, in this world where such qualities\r\nare seldom found. I should like you to think sometimes of me. Stay,” she\r\nsaid, glancing about her, “there is this box that has held my gloves.\r\nEvery time I opened it before going to a ball or to the theatre, I used\r\nto feel that I must be beautiful, because I was so happy; and I never\r\ntouched it except to lay some gracious memory in it: there is so much\r\nof my old self in it, of a Madame de Beauseant who now lives no longer.\r\nWill you take it? I will leave directions that it is to be sent to\r\nyou in the Rue d’Artois.--Mme. de Nucingen looked very charming this\r\nevening. Eugene, you must love her. Perhaps we may never see each other\r\nagain, my friend; but be sure of this, that I shall pray for you who\r\nhave been kind to me.--Now, let us go downstairs. People shall not think\r\nthat I am weeping. I have all time and eternity before me, and where\r\nI am going I shall be alone, and no one will ask me the reason of my\r\ntears. One last look round first.”\r\n\r\nShe stood for a moment. Then she covered her eyes with her hands for\r\nan instant, dashed away the tears, bathed her face with cold water, and\r\ntook the student’s arm.\r\n\r\n“Let us go!” she said.\r\n\r\nThis suffering, endured with such noble fortitude, shook Eugene with\r\na more violent emotion than he had felt before. They went back to the\r\nballroom, and Mme. de Beauseant went through the rooms on Eugene’s\r\narm--the last delicately gracious act of a gracious woman. In another\r\nmoment he saw the sisters, Mme. de Restaud and Mme. de Nucingen. The\r\nCountess shone in all the glory of her magnificent diamonds; every stone\r\nmust have scorched like fire, she was never to wear them again. Strong\r\nas love and pride might be in her, she found it difficult to meet her\r\nhusband’s eyes. The sight of her was scarcely calculated to lighten\r\nRastignac’s sad thoughts; through the blaze of those diamonds he seemed\r\nto see the wretched pallet-bed on which Father Goriot was lying. The\r\nVicomtesse misread his melancholy; she withdrew her hand from his arm.\r\n\r\n“Come,” she said, “I must not deprive you of a pleasure.”\r\n\r\nEugene was soon claimed by Delphine. She was delighted by the impression\r\nthat she had made, and eager to lay at her lover’s feet the homage\r\nshe had received in this new world in which she hoped to live and move\r\nhenceforth.\r\n\r\n“What do you think of Nasie?” she asked him.\r\n\r\n“She has discounted everything, even her own father’s death,” said\r\nRastignac.\r\n\r\nTowards four o’clock in the morning the rooms began to empty. A little\r\nlater the music ceased, and the Duchesse de Langeais and Rastignac were\r\nleft in the great ballroom. The Vicomtesse, who thought to find the\r\nstudent there alone, came back there at last. She had taken leave of M.\r\nde Beauseant, who had gone off to bed, saying again as he went, “It is\r\na great pity, my dear, to shut yourself up at your age! Pray stay among\r\nus.”\r\n\r\nMme. de Beauseant saw the Duchesse, and, in spite of herself, an\r\nexclamation broke from her.\r\n\r\n“I saw how it was, Clara,” said Mme. de Langeais. “You are going from\r\namong us, and you will never come back. But you must not go until you\r\nhave heard me, until we have understood each other.”\r\n\r\nShe took her friend’s arm, and they went together into the next room.\r\nThere the Duchess looked at her with tears in her eyes; she held her\r\nfriend in close embrace and kissed her cheek.\r\n\r\n“I could not let you go without a word, dearest; the remorse would have\r\nbeen too hard to bear. You can count upon me as surely as upon yourself.\r\nYou have shown yourself great this evening; I feel that I am worthy\r\nof our friendship, and I mean to prove myself worthy of it. I have not\r\nalways been kind; I was in the wrong; forgive me, dearest; I wish I\r\ncould unsay anything that may have hurt you; I take back those words.\r\nOne common sorrow has brought us together again, for I do not know which\r\nof us is the more miserable. M. de Montriveau was not here to-night;\r\ndo you understand what that means?--None of those who saw you to-night,\r\nClara, will ever forget you. I mean to make one last effort. If I fail,\r\nI shall go into a convent. Clara, where are you going?”\r\n\r\n“Into Normandy, to Courcelles. I shall love and pray there until the day\r\nwhen God shall take me from this world.--M. de Rastignac!” called the\r\nVicomtesse, in a tremulous voice, remembering that the young man was\r\nwaiting there.\r\n\r\nThe student knelt to kiss his cousin’s hand.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, Antoinette!” said Mme. de Beauseant. “May you be happy.”--She\r\nturned to the student. “You are young,” she said; “you have some beliefs\r\nstill left. I have been privileged, like some dying people, to find\r\nsincere and reverent feeling in those about me as I take my leave of\r\nthis world.”\r\n\r\nIt was nearly five o’clock that morning when Rastignac came away. He had\r\nput Mme. de Beauseant into her traveling carriage, and received her last\r\nfarewells, spoken amid fast-falling tears; for no greatness is so great\r\nthat it can rise above the laws of human affection, or live beyond\r\nthe jurisdiction of pain, as certain demagogues would have the people\r\nbelieve. Eugene returned on foot to the Maison Vauquer through the cold\r\nand darkness. His education was nearly complete.\r\n\r\n“There is no hope for poor Father Goriot,” said Bianchon, as Rastignac\r\ncame into the room. Eugene looked for a while at the sleeping man, then\r\nhe turned to his friend. “Dear fellow, you are content with the modest\r\ncareer you have marked out for yourself; keep to it. I am in hell, and\r\nI must stay there. Believe everything that you hear said of the world,\r\nnothing is too impossibly bad. No Juvenal could paint the horrors hidden\r\naway under the covering of gems and gold.”\r\n\r\nAt two o’clock in the afternoon Bianchon came to wake Rastignac, and\r\nbegged him to take charge of Goriot, who had grown worse as the day wore\r\non. The medical student was obliged to go out.\r\n\r\n“Poor old man, he has not two days to live, maybe not many hours,” he\r\nsaid; “but we must do our utmost, all the same, to fight the disease. It\r\nwill be a very troublesome case, and we shall want money. We can nurse\r\nhim between us, of course, but, for my own part, I have not a penny. I\r\nhave turned out his pockets, and rummaged through his drawers--result,\r\nnix. I asked him about it while his mind was clear, and he told me he\r\nhad not a farthing of his own. What have you?”\r\n\r\n“I have twenty francs left,” said Rastignac; “but I will take them to\r\nthe roulette table, I shall be sure to win.”\r\n\r\n“And if you lose?”\r\n\r\n“Then I shall go to his sons-in-law and his daughters and ask them for\r\nmoney.”\r\n\r\n“And suppose they refuse?” Bianchon retorted. “The most pressing thing\r\njust now is not really money; we must put mustard poultices, as hot as\r\nthey can be made, on his feet and legs. If he calls out, there is still\r\nsome hope for him. You know how to set about doing it, and besides,\r\nChristophe will help you. I am going round to the dispensary to persuade\r\nthem to let us have the things we want on credit. It is a pity that\r\nwe could not move him to the hospital; poor fellow, he would be better\r\nthere. Well, come along, I leave you in charge; you must stay with him\r\ntill I come back.”\r\n\r\nThe two young men went back to the room where the old man was lying.\r\nEugene was startled at the change in Goriot’s face, so livid, distorted,\r\nand feeble.\r\n\r\n“How are you, papa?” he said, bending over the pallet-bed. Goriot\r\nturned his dull eyes upon Eugene, looked at him attentively, and did not\r\nrecognize him. It was more than the student could bear; the tears came\r\ninto his eyes.\r\n\r\n“Bianchon, ought we to have the curtains put up in the windows?”\r\n\r\n“No, the temperature and the light do not affect him now. It would be a\r\ngood thing for him if he felt heat or cold; but we must have a fire in\r\nany case to make tisanes and heat the other things. I will send round a\r\nfew sticks; they will last till we can have in some firewood. I burned\r\nall the bark fuel you had left, as well as his, poor man, yesterday and\r\nduring the night. The place is so damp that the water stood in drops on\r\nthe walls; I could hardly get the room dry. Christophe came in and swept\r\nthe floor, but the place is like a stable; I had to burn juniper, the\r\nsmell was something horrible.\r\n\r\n“_Mon Dieu!_” said Rastignac. “To think of those daughters of his.”\r\n\r\n“One moment, if he asks for something to drink, give him this,” said the\r\nhouse student, pointing to a large white jar. “If he begins to groan,\r\nand the belly feels hot and hard to the touch, you know what to do; get\r\nChristophe to help you. If he should happen to grow much excited, and\r\nbegin to talk a good deal and even to ramble in his talk, do not be\r\nalarmed. It would not be a bad symptom. But send Christophe to the\r\nHospice Cochin. Our doctor, my chum, or I will come and apply moxas. We\r\nhad a great consultation this morning while you were asleep. A surgeon,\r\na pupil of Gall’s came, and our house surgeon, and the head physician\r\nfrom the Hotel-Dieu. Those gentlemen considered that the symptoms were\r\nvery unusual and interesting; the case must be carefully watched, for\r\nit throws a light on several obscure and rather important scientific\r\nproblems. One of the authorities says that if there is more pressure of\r\nserum on one or other portion of the brain, it should affect his mental\r\ncapacities in such and such directions. So if he should talk, notice\r\nvery carefully what kind of ideas his mind seems to run on; whether\r\nmemory, or penetration, or the reasoning faculties are exercised;\r\nwhether sentiments or practical questions fill his thoughts; whether he\r\nmakes forecasts or dwells on the past; in fact; you must be prepared\r\nto give an accurate report of him. It is quite likely that the\r\nextravasation fills the whole brain, in which case he will die in the\r\nimbecile state in which he is lying now. You cannot tell anything about\r\nthese mysterious nervous diseases. Suppose the crash came here,” said\r\nBianchon, touching the back of the head, “very strange things have been\r\nknown to happen; the brain sometimes partially recovers, and death is\r\ndelayed. Or the congested matter may pass out of the brain altogether\r\nthrough channels which can only be determined by a post-mortem\r\nexamination. There is an old man at the Hospital for Incurables, an\r\nimbecile patient, in his case the effusion has followed the direction of\r\nthe spinal cord; he suffers horrid agonies, but he lives.”\r\n\r\n“Did they enjoy themselves?” It was Father Goriot who spoke. He had\r\nrecognized Eugene.\r\n\r\n“Oh! he thinks of nothing but his daughters,” said Bianchon. “Scores\r\nof times last night he said to me, ‘They are dancing now! She has her\r\ndress.’ He called them by their names. He made me cry, the devil take\r\nit, calling with that tone in his voice, for ‘Delphine! my little\r\nDelphine! and Nasie!’ Upon my word,” said the medical student, “it was\r\nenough to make any one burst out crying.”\r\n\r\n“Delphine,” said the old man, “she is there, isn’t she? I knew she was\r\nthere,” and his eyes sought the door.\r\n\r\n“I am going down now to tell Sylvie to get the poultices ready,” said\r\nBianchon. “They ought to go on at once.”\r\n\r\nRastignac was left alone with the old man. He sat at the foot of the\r\nbed, and gazed at the face before him, so horribly changed that it was\r\nshocking to see.\r\n\r\n“Noble natures cannot dwell in this world,” he said; “Mme de Beauseant\r\nhas fled from it, and there he lies dying. What place indeed is there in\r\nthe shallow petty frivolous thing called society for noble thoughts and\r\nfeelings?”\r\n\r\nPictures of yesterday’s ball rose up in his memory, in strange contrast\r\nto the deathbed before him. Bianchon suddenly appeared.\r\n\r\n“I say, Eugene, I have just seen our head surgeon at the hospital, and I\r\nran all the way back here. If the old man shows any signs of reason, if\r\nhe begins to talk, cover him with a mustard poultice from the neck to\r\nthe base of the spine, and send round for us.”\r\n\r\n“Dear Bianchon,” exclaimed Eugene.\r\n\r\n“Oh! it is an interesting case from a scientific point of view,” said\r\nthe medical student, with all the enthusiasm of a neophyte.\r\n\r\n“So!” said Eugene. “Am I really the only one who cares for the poor old\r\nman for his own sake?”\r\n\r\n“You would not have said so if you had seen me this morning,” returned\r\nBianchon, who did not take offence at this speech. “Doctors who have\r\nseen a good deal of practice never see anything but the disease, but, my\r\ndear fellow, I can see the patient still.”\r\n\r\nHe went. Eugene was left alone with the old man, and with an\r\napprehension of a crisis that set in, in fact, before very long.\r\n\r\n“Ah! dear boy, is that you?” said Father Goriot, recognizing Eugene.\r\n\r\n“Do you feel better?” asked the law student, taking his hand.\r\n\r\n“Yes. My head felt as if it were being screwed up in a vise, but now it\r\nis set free again. Did you see my girls? They will be here directly; as\r\nsoon as they know that I am ill they will hurry here at once; they used\r\nto take such care of me in the Rue de la Jussienne! Great Heavens! if\r\nonly my room was fit for them to come into! There has been a young man\r\nhere, who has burned up all my bark fuel.”\r\n\r\n“I can hear Christophe coming upstairs,” Eugene answered. “He is\r\nbringing up some firewood that that young man has sent you.”\r\n\r\n“Good, but how am I to pay for the wood. I have not a penny left, dear\r\nboy. I have given everything, everything. I am a pauper now. Well, at\r\nleast the golden gown was grand, was it not? (Ah! what pain this is!)\r\nThanks, Christophe! God will reward you, my boy; I have nothing left\r\nnow.”\r\n\r\nEugene went over to Christophe and whispered in the man’s ear, “I will\r\npay you well, and Sylvie too, for your trouble.”\r\n\r\n“My daughters told you that they were coming, didn’t they, Christophe?\r\nGo again to them, and I will give you five francs. Tell them that I am\r\nnot feeling well, that I should like to kiss them both and see them once\r\nagain before I die. Tell them that, but don’t alarm them more than you\r\ncan help.”\r\n\r\nRastignac signed to Christophe to go, and the man went.\r\n\r\n“They will come before long,” the old man went on. “I know them so well.\r\nMy tender-hearted Delphine! If I am going to die, she will feel it so\r\nmuch! And so will Nasie. I do not want to die; they will cry if I die;\r\nand if I die, dear Eugene, I shall not see them any more. It will\r\nbe very dreary there where I am going. For a father it is hell to be\r\nwithout your children; I have served my apprenticeship already since\r\nthey married. My heaven was in the Rue de la Jussienne. Eugene, do you\r\nthink that if I go to heaven I can come back to earth, and be near them\r\nin spirit? I have heard some such things said. It is true? It is as if\r\nI could see them at this moment as they used to be when we all lived\r\nin the Rue de la Jussienne. They used to come downstairs of a morning.\r\n‘Good-morning, papa!’ they used to say, and I would take them on my\r\nknees; we had all sorts of little games of play together, and they had\r\nsuch pretty coaxing ways. We always had breakfast together, too, every\r\nmorning, and they had dinner with me--in fact, I was a father then. I\r\nenjoyed my children. They did not think for themselves so long as they\r\nlived in the Rue de la Jussienne; they knew nothing of the world; they\r\nloved me with all their hearts. _Mon Dieu!_ why could they not always\r\nbe little girls? (Oh! my head! this racking pain in my head!) Ah! ah!\r\nforgive me, children, this pain is fearful; it must be agony indeed, for\r\nyou have used me to endure pain. _Mon Dieu!_ if only I held their hands\r\nin mine, I should not feel it at all.--Do you think that they are on the\r\nway? Christophe is so stupid; I ought to have gone myself. _He_ will see\r\nthem. But you went to the ball yesterday; just tell me how they looked.\r\nThey did not know that I was ill, did they, or they would not have been\r\ndancing, poor little things? Oh! I must not be ill any longer. They\r\nstand too much in need of me; their fortunes are in danger. And such\r\nhusbands as they are bound to! I must get well! (Oh! what pain this\r\nis! what pain this is! ... ah! ah!)--I must get well, you see; for they\r\n_must_ have money, and I know how to set about making some. I will go\r\nto Odessa and manufacture starch there. I am an old hand, I will make\r\nmillions. (Oh! this is agony!)”\r\n\r\nGoriot was silent for a moment; it seemed to require his whole strength\r\nto endure the pain.\r\n\r\n“If they were here, I should not complain,” he said. “So why should I\r\ncomplain now?”\r\n\r\nHe seemed to grow drowsy with exhaustion, and lay quietly for a long\r\ntime. Christophe came back; and Rastignac, thinking that Goriot was\r\nasleep, allowed the man to give his story aloud.\r\n\r\n“First of all, sir, I went to Madame la Comtesse,” he said; “but she\r\nand her husband were so busy that I couldn’t get to speak to her. When I\r\ninsisted that I must see her, M. de Restaud came out to me himself, and\r\nwent on like this: ‘M. Goriot is dying, is he? Very well, it is the\r\nbest thing he can do. I want Mme. de Restaud to transact some important\r\nbusiness, when it is all finished she can go.’ The gentleman looked\r\nangry, I thought. I was just going away when Mme. de Restaud came out\r\ninto an ante-chamber through a door that I did not notice, and said,\r\n‘Christophe, tell my father that my husband wants me to discuss some\r\nmatters with him, and I cannot leave the house, the life or death of my\r\nchildren is at stake; but as soon as it is over, I will come.’ As for\r\nMadame la Baronne, that is another story! I could not speak to her\r\neither, and I did not even see her. Her waiting-woman said, ‘Ah yes, but\r\nmadame only came back from a ball at a quarter to five this morning; she\r\nis asleep now, and if I wake her before mid-day she will be cross. As\r\nsoon as she rings, I will go and tell her that her father is worse. It\r\nwill be time enough then to tell her bad news!’ I begged and I prayed,\r\nbut, there! it was no good. Then I asked for M. le Baron, but he was\r\nout.”\r\n\r\n“To think that neither of his daughters should come!” exclaimed\r\nRastignac. “I will write to them both.”\r\n\r\n“Neither of them!” cried the old man, sitting upright in bed. “They are\r\nbusy, they are asleep, they will not come! I knew that they would not.\r\nNot until you are dying do you know your children.... Oh! my friend, do\r\nnot marry; do not have children! You give them life; they give you your\r\ndeathblow. You bring them into the world, and they send you out of it.\r\nNo, they will not come. I have known that these ten years. Sometimes I\r\nhave told myself so, but I did not dare to believe it.”\r\n\r\nThe tears gathered and stood without overflowing the red sockets.\r\n\r\n“Ah! if I were rich still, if I had kept my money, if I had not given\r\nall to them, they would be with me now; they would fawn on me and cover\r\nmy cheeks with their kisses! I should be living in a great mansion; I\r\nshould have grand apartments and servants and a fire in my room; and\r\n_they_ would be about me all in tears, and their husbands and their\r\nchildren. I should have had all that; now--I have nothing. Money brings\r\neverything to you; even your daughters. My money. Oh! where is my money?\r\nIf I had plenty of money to leave behind me, they would nurse me and\r\ntend me; I should hear their voices, I should see their faces. Ah, God!\r\nwho knows? They both of them have hearts of stone. I loved them too\r\nmuch; it was not likely that they should love me. A father ought always\r\nto be rich; he ought to keep his children well in hand, like unruly\r\nhorses. I have gone down on my knees to them. Wretches! this is the\r\ncrowning act that brings the last ten years to a proper close. If you\r\nbut knew how much they made of me just after they were married. (Oh!\r\nthis is cruel torture!) I had just given them each eight hundred\r\nthousand francs; they were bound to be civil to me after that, and their\r\nhusbands too were civil. I used to go to their houses: it was ‘My kind\r\nfather’ here, ‘My dear father’ there. There was always a place for me at\r\ntheir tables. I used to dine with their husbands now and then, and they\r\nwere very respectful to me. I was still worth something, they thought.\r\nHow should they know? I had not said anything about my affairs. It\r\nis worth while to be civil to a man who has given his daughters eight\r\nhundred thousand francs apiece; and they showed me every attention\r\nthen--but it was all for my money. Grand people are not great. I\r\nfound that out by experience! I went to the theatre with them in their\r\ncarriage; I might stay as long as I cared to stay at their evening\r\nparties. In fact, they acknowledged me their father; publicly they owned\r\nthat they were my daughters. But I was always a shrewd one, you see,\r\nand nothing was lost upon me. Everything went straight to the mark and\r\npierced my heart. I saw quite well that it was all sham and pretence,\r\nbut there is no help for such things as these. I felt less at my ease at\r\ntheir dinner-table than I did downstairs here. I had nothing to say for\r\nmyself. So these grand folks would ask in my son-in-law’s ear, ‘Who may\r\nthat gentleman be?’--‘The father-in-law with the money bags; he is very\r\nrich.’--‘The devil, he is!’ they would say, and look again at me with\r\nthe respect due to my money. Well, if I was in the way sometimes, I paid\r\ndearly for my mistakes. And besides, who is perfect? (My head is one\r\nsore!) Dear Monsieur Eugene, I am suffering so now, that a man might die\r\nof the pain; but it is nothing to be compared with the pain I endured\r\nwhen Anastasie made me feel, for the first time, that I had said\r\nsomething stupid. She looked at me, and that glance of hers opened all\r\nmy veins. I used to want to know everything, to be learned; and one\r\nthing I did learn thoroughly--I knew that I was not wanted here on\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n“The next day I went to Delphine for comfort, and what should I do there\r\nbut make some stupid blunder that made her angry with me. I was like one\r\ndriven out of his senses. For a week I did not know what to do; I did\r\nnot dare to go to see them for fear they should reproach me. And that\r\nwas how they both turned me out of the house.\r\n\r\n“Oh God! Thou knowest all the misery and anguish that I have endured;\r\nThou hast counted all the wounds that have been dealt to me in these\r\nyears that have aged and changed me and whitened my hair and drained my\r\nlife; why dost Thou make me to suffer so to-day? Have I not more than\r\nexpiated the sin of loving them too much? They themselves have been the\r\ninstruments of vengeance; they have tortured me for my sin of affection.\r\n\r\n“Ah, well! fathers know no better; I loved them so; I went back to them\r\nas a gambler goes to the gaming table. This love was my vice, you see,\r\nmy mistress--they were everything in the world to me. They were always\r\nwanting something or other, dresses and ornaments, and what not; their\r\nmaids used to tell me what they wanted, and I used to give them the\r\nthings for the sake of the welcome that they bought for me. But, at\r\nthe same time, they used to give me little lectures on my behavior in\r\nsociety; they began about it at once. Then they began to feel ashamed of\r\nme. That is what comes of having your children well brought up. I could\r\nnot go to school again at my time of life. (This pain is fearful! _Mon\r\nDieu!_ These doctors! these doctors! If they would open my head, it\r\nwould give me some relief!) Oh, my daughters, my daughters! Anastasie!\r\nDelphine! If I could only see them! Send for the police, and make them\r\ncome to me! Justice is on my side, the whole world is on my side, I have\r\nnatural rights, and the law with me. I protest! The country will go to\r\nruin if a father’s rights are trampled under foot. That is easy to see.\r\nThe whole world turns on fatherly love; fatherly love is the foundation\r\nof society; it will crumble into ruin when children do not love their\r\nfathers. Oh! if I could only see them, and hear them, no matter what\r\nthey said; if I could simply hear their voices, it would soothe the\r\npain. Delphine! Delphine most of all. But tell them when they come not\r\nto look so coldly at me as they do. Oh! my friend, my good Monsieur\r\nEugene, you do not know that it is when all the golden light in a glance\r\nsuddenly turns to a leaden gray. It has been one long winter here since\r\nthe light in their eyes shone no more for me. I have had nothing but\r\ndisappointments to devour. Disappointment has been my daily bread; I\r\nhave lived on humiliation and insults. I have swallowed down all the\r\naffronts for which they sold me my poor stealthy little moments of\r\njoy; for I love them so! Think of it! a father hiding himself to get a\r\nglimpse of his children! I have given all my life to them, and to-day\r\nthey will not give me one hour! I am hungering and thirsting for them,\r\nmy heart is burning in me, but they will not come to bring relief in the\r\nagony, for I am dying now, I feel that this is death. Do they not know\r\nwhat it means to trample on a father’s corpse? There is a God in heaven\r\nwho avenges us fathers whether we will or no.\r\n\r\n“Oh! they will come! Come to me, darlings, and give me one more kiss;\r\none last kiss, the Viaticum for your father, who will pray God for you\r\nin heaven. I will tell Him that you have been good children to your\r\nfather, and plead your cause with God! After all, it is not their fault.\r\nI tell you they are innocent, my friend. Tell every one that it is not\r\ntheir fault, and no one need be distressed on my account. It is all my\r\nown fault, I taught them to trample upon me. I loved to have it so.\r\nIt is no one’s affair but mine; man’s justice and God’s justice have\r\nnothing to do in it. God would be unjust if He condemned them for\r\nanything they may have done to me. I did not behave to them properly;\r\nI was stupid enough to resign my rights. I would have humbled myself in\r\nthe dust for them. What could you expect? The most beautiful nature, the\r\nnoblest soul, would have been spoiled by such indulgence. I am a wretch,\r\nI am justly punished. I, and I only, am to blame for all their sins; I\r\nspoiled them. To-day they are as eager for pleasure as they used to be\r\nfor sugar-plums. When they were little girls I indulged them in every\r\nwhim. They had a carriage of their own when they were fifteen. They\r\nhave never been crossed. I am guilty, and not they--but I sinned through\r\nlove.\r\n\r\n“My heart would open at the sound of their voices. I can hear them; they\r\nare coming. Yes! yes! they are coming. The law demands that they should\r\nbe present at their father’s deathbed; the law is on my side. It would\r\nonly cost them the hire of a cab. I would pay that. Write to them, tell\r\nthem that I have millions to leave to them! On my word of honor, yes. I\r\nam going to manufacture Italian paste foods at Odessa. I understand the\r\ntrade. There are millions to be made in it. Nobody has thought of the\r\nscheme as yet. You see, there will be no waste, no damage in transit,\r\nas there always is with wheat and flour. Hey! hey! and starch too; there\r\nare millions to be made in the starch trade! You will not be telling\r\na lie. Millions, tell them; and even if they really come because they\r\ncovet the money, I would rather let them deceive me; and I shall see\r\nthem in any case. I want my children! I gave them life; they are mine,\r\nmine!” and he sat upright. The head thus raised, with its scanty white\r\nhair, seemed to Eugene like a threat; every line that could still speak\r\nspoke of menace.\r\n\r\n“There, there, dear father,” said Eugene, “lie down again; I will write\r\nto them at once. As soon as Bianchon comes back I will go for them\r\nmyself, if they do not come before.”\r\n\r\n“If they do not come?” repeated the old man, sobbing. “Why, I shall\r\nbe dead before then; I shall die in a fit of rage, of rage! Anger is\r\ngetting the better of me. I can see my whole life at this minute. I have\r\nbeen cheated! They do not love me--they have never loved me all their\r\nlives! It is all clear to me. They have not come, and they will not\r\ncome. The longer they put off their coming, the less they are likely\r\nto give me this joy. I know them. They have never cared to guess my\r\ndisappointments, my sorrows, my wants; they never cared to know my life;\r\nthey will have no presentiment of my death; they do not even know the\r\nsecret of my tenderness for them. Yes, I see it all now. I have laid my\r\nheart open so often, that they take everything I do for them as a matter\r\nof course. They might have asked me for the very eyes out of my head and\r\nI would have bidden them to pluck them out. They think that all fathers\r\nare like theirs. You should always make your value felt. Their own\r\nchildren will avenge me. Why, for their own sakes they should come to\r\nme! Make them understand that they are laying up retribution for their\r\nown deathbeds. All crimes are summed up in this one.... Go to them; just\r\ntell them that if they stay away it will be parricide! There is enough\r\nlaid to their charge already without adding that to the list. Cry aloud\r\nas I do now, ‘Nasie! Delphine! here! Come to your father; the father who\r\nhas been so kind to you is lying ill!’--Not a sound; no one comes! Then\r\nam I to die like a dog? This is to be my reward--I am forsaken at the\r\nlast. They are wicked, heartless women; curses on them, I loathe them.\r\nI shall rise at night from my grave to curse them again; for, after all,\r\nmy friends, have I done wrong? They are behaving very badly to me, eh?\r\n... What am I saying? Did you not tell me just now that Delphine is in\r\nthe room? She is more tender-hearted than her sister.... Eugene, you are\r\nmy son, you know. You will love her; be a father to her! Her sister is\r\nvery unhappy. And there are their fortunes! Ah, God! I am dying, this\r\nanguish is almost more than I can bear! Cut off my head; leave me\r\nnothing but my heart.”\r\n\r\n“Christophe!” shouted Eugene, alarmed by the way in which the old man\r\nmoaned, and by his cries, “go for M. Bianchon, and send a cab here for\r\nme.--I am going to fetch them, dear father; I will bring them back to\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Make them come! Compel them to come! Call out the Guard, the military,\r\nanything and everything, but make them come!” He looked at Eugene, and a\r\nlast gleam of intelligence shone in his eyes. “Go to the authorities, to\r\nthe Public Prosecutor, let them bring them here; come they shall!”\r\n\r\n“But you have cursed them.”\r\n\r\n“Who said that!” said the old man in dull amazement. “You know quite\r\nwell that I love them, I adore them! I shall be quite well again if I\r\ncan see them.... Go for them, my good neighbor, my dear boy, you are\r\nkind-hearted; I wish I could repay you for your kindness, but I have\r\nnothing to give you now, save the blessing of a dying man. Ah! if I\r\ncould only see Delphine, to tell her to pay my debt to you. If the other\r\ncannot come, bring Delphine to me at any rate. Tell her that unless she\r\ncomes, you will not love her any more. She is so fond of you that she\r\nwill come to me then. Give me something to drink! There is a fire in my\r\nbowels. Press something against my forehead! If my daughters would lay\r\ntheir hands there, I think I should get better. ... _Mon Dieu!_ who\r\nwill recover their money for them when I am gone?... I will manufacture\r\nvermicelli out in Odessa; I will go to Odessa for their sakes.”\r\n\r\n“Here is something to drink,” said Eugene, supporting the dying man on\r\nhis left arm, while he held a cup of tisane to Goriot’s lips.\r\n\r\n“How you must love your own father and mother!” said the old man, and\r\ngrasped the student’s hand in both of his. It was a feeble, trembling\r\ngrasp. “I am going to die; I shall die without seeing my daughters; do\r\nyou understand? To be always thirsting, and never to drink; that\r\nhas been my life for the last ten years.... I have no daughters, my\r\nsons-in-law killed them. No, since their marriages they have been\r\ndead to me. Fathers should petition the Chambers to pass a law\r\nagainst marriage. If you love your daughters, do not let them marry. A\r\nson-in-law is a rascal who poisons a girl’s mind and contaminates\r\nher whole nature. Let us have no more marriages! It robs us of our\r\ndaughters; we are left alone upon our deathbeds, and they are not with\r\nus then. They ought to pass a law for dying fathers. This is awful! It\r\ncries for vengeance! They cannot come, because my sons-in-law forbid\r\nthem!... Kill them!... Restaud and the Alsatian, kill them both! They\r\nhave murdered me between them!... Death or my daughters!... Ah! it is\r\ntoo late, I am dying, and they are not here!... Dying without them!...\r\nNasie! Fifine! Why do you not come to me? Your papa is going----”\r\n\r\n“Dear Father Goriot, calm yourself. There, there, lie quietly and rest;\r\ndon’t worry yourself, don’t think.”\r\n\r\n“I shall not see them. Oh! the agony of it!”\r\n\r\n“You _shall_ see them.”\r\n\r\n“Really?” cried the old man, still wandering. “Oh! shall I see them; I\r\nshall see them and hear their voices. I shall die happy. Ah! well, after\r\nall, I do not wish to live; I cannot stand this much longer; this\r\npain that grows worse and worse. But, oh! to see them, to touch their\r\ndresses--ah! nothing but their dresses, that is very little; still, to\r\nfeel something that belongs to them. Let me touch their hair with my\r\nfingers... their hair...”\r\n\r\nHis head fell back on the pillow, as if a sudden heavy blow had struck\r\nhim down, but his hands groped feebly over the quilt, as if to find his\r\ndaughters’ hair.\r\n\r\n“My blessing on them...” he said, making an effort, “my blessing...”\r\n\r\nHis voice died away. Just at that moment Bianchon came into the room.\r\n\r\n“I met Christophe,” he said; “he is gone for your cab.”\r\n\r\nThen he looked at the patient, and raised the closed eyelids with his\r\nfingers. The two students saw how dead and lustreless the eyes beneath\r\nhad grown.\r\n\r\n“He will not get over this, I am sure,” said Bianchon. He felt the old\r\nman’s pulse, and laid a hand over his heart.\r\n\r\n“The machinery works still; more is the pity, in his state it would be\r\nbetter for him to die.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! my word, it would!”\r\n\r\n“What is the matter with you? You are as pale as death.”\r\n\r\n“Dear fellow, the moans and cries that I have just heard.... There is\r\na God! Ah! yes, yes, there is a God, and He has made a better world for\r\nus, or this world of ours would be a nightmare. I could have cried like\r\na child; but this is too tragical, and I am sick at heart.\r\n\r\n“We want a lot of things, you know; and where is the money to come\r\nfrom?”\r\n\r\nRastignac took out his watch.\r\n\r\n“There, be quick and pawn it. I do not want to stop on the way to the\r\nRue du Helder; there is not a moment to lose, I am afraid, and I must\r\nwait here till Christophe comes back. I have not a farthing; I shall\r\nhave to pay the cabman when I get home again.”\r\n\r\nRastignac rushed down the stairs, and drove off to the Rue du Helder.\r\nThe awful scene through which he had just passed quickened his\r\nimagination, and he grew fiercely indignant. He reached Mme. de\r\nRestaud’s house only to be told by the servant that his mistress could\r\nsee no one.\r\n\r\n“But I have brought a message from her father, who is dying,” Rastignac\r\ntold the man.\r\n\r\n“The Count has given us the strictest orders, sir----”\r\n\r\n“If it is M. de Restaud who has given the orders, tell him that his\r\nfather-in-law is dying, and that I am here, and must speak with him at\r\nonce.”\r\n\r\nThe man went out.\r\n\r\nEugene waited for a long while. “Perhaps her father is dying at this\r\nmoment,” he thought.\r\n\r\nThen the man came back, and Eugene followed him to the little\r\ndrawing-room. M. de Restaud was standing before the fireless grate, and\r\ndid not ask his visitor to seat himself.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur le Comte,” said Rastignac, “M. Goriot, your father-in-law, is\r\nlying at the point of death in a squalid den in the Latin Quarter.\r\nHe has not a penny to pay for firewood; he is expected to die at any\r\nmoment, and keeps calling for his daughter----”\r\n\r\n“I feel very little affection for M. Goriot, sir, as you probably are\r\naware,” the Count answered coolly. “His character has been compromised\r\nin connection with Mme. de Restaud; he is the author of the misfortunes\r\nthat have embittered my life and troubled my peace of mind. It is a\r\nmatter of perfect indifference to me if he lives or dies. Now you know\r\nmy feelings with regard to him. Public opinion may blame me, but I\r\ncare nothing for public opinion. Just now I have other and much\r\nmore important matters to think about than the things that fools and\r\nchatterers may say about me. As for Mme. de Restaud, she cannot leave\r\nthe house; she is in no condition to do so. And, besides, I shall not\r\nallow her to leave it. Tell her father that as soon as she has done her\r\nduty by her husband and child she shall go to see him. If she has any\r\nlove for her father, she can be free to go to him, if she chooses, in a\r\nfew seconds; it lies entirely with her----”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur le Comte, it is no business of mine to criticise your conduct;\r\nyou can do as you please with your wife, but may I count upon your\r\nkeeping your word with me? Well, then, promise me to tell her that her\r\nfather has not twenty-four hours to live; that he looks in vain for her,\r\nand has cursed her already as he lies on his deathbed,--that is all I\r\nask.”\r\n\r\n“You can tell her yourself,” the Count answered, impressed by the thrill\r\nof indignation in Eugene’s voice.\r\n\r\nThe Count led the way to the room where his wife usually sat. She was\r\ndrowned in tears, and lay crouching in the depths of an armchair, as\r\nif she were tired of life and longed to die. It was piteous to see her.\r\nBefore venturing to look at Rastignac, she glanced at her husband in\r\nevident and abject terror that spoke of complete prostration of body\r\nand mind; she seemed crushed by a tyranny both mental and physical. The\r\nCount jerked his head towards her; she construed this as a permission to\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n“I heard all that you said, monsieur. Tell my father that if he knew all\r\nhe would forgive me.... I did not think there was such torture in the\r\nworld as this; it is more than I can endure, monsieur!--But I will not\r\ngive way as long as I live,” she said, turning to her husband. “I am a\r\nmother.--Tell my father that I have never sinned against him in spite of\r\nappearances!” she cried aloud in her despair.\r\n\r\nEugene bowed to the husband and wife; he guessed the meaning of the\r\nscene, and that this was a terrible crisis in the Countess’ life. M. de\r\nRestaud’s manner had told him that his errand was a fruitless one; he\r\nsaw that Anastasie had no longer any liberty of action. He came away\r\nmazed and bewildered, and hurried to Mme. de Nucingen. Delphine was in\r\nbed.\r\n\r\n“Poor dear Eugene, I am ill,” she said. “I caught cold after the ball,\r\nand I am afraid of pneumonia. I am waiting for the doctor to come.”\r\n\r\n“If you were at death’s door,” Eugene broke in, “you must be carried\r\nsomehow to your father. He is calling for you. If you could hear the\r\nfaintest of those cries, you would not feel ill any longer.”\r\n\r\n“Eugene, I dare say my father is not quite so ill as you say; but I\r\ncannot bear to do anything that you do not approve, so I will do just\r\nas you wish. As for _him_, he would die of grief I know if I went out to\r\nsee him and brought on a dangerous illness. Well, I will go as soon as\r\nI have seen the doctor.--Ah!” she cried out, “you are not wearing your\r\nwatch, how is that?”\r\n\r\nEugene reddened.\r\n\r\n“Eugene, Eugene! if you have sold it already or lost it.... Oh! it would\r\nbe very wrong of you!”\r\n\r\nThe student bent over Delphine and said in her ear, “Do you want to\r\nknow? Very well, then, you shall know. Your father has nothing left to\r\npay for the shroud that they will lay him in this evening. Your watch\r\nhas been pawned, for I had nothing either.”\r\n\r\nDelphine sprang out of bed, ran to her desk, and took out her purse. She\r\ngave it to Eugene, and rang the bell, crying:\r\n\r\n“I will go, I will go at once, Eugene. Leave me, I will dress. Why,\r\nI should be an unnatural daughter! Go back; I will be there before\r\nyou.--Therese,” she called to the waiting-woman, “ask M. de Nucingen to\r\ncome upstairs at once and speak to me.”\r\n\r\nEugene was almost happy when he reached the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve;\r\nhe was so glad to bring the news to the dying man that one of his\r\ndaughters was coming. He fumbled in Delphine’s purse for money, so as to\r\ndismiss the cab at once; and discovered that the young, beautiful, and\r\nwealthy woman of fashion had only seventy francs in her private purse.\r\nHe climbed the stairs and found Bianchon supporting Goriot, while the\r\nhouse surgeon from the hospital was applying moxas to the patient’s\r\nback--under the direction of the physician, it was the last expedient of\r\nscience, and it was tried in vain.\r\n\r\n“Can you feel them?” asked the physician. But Goriot had caught sight of\r\nRastignac, and answered, “They are coming, are they not?”\r\n\r\n“There is hope yet,” said the surgeon; “he can speak.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Eugene, “Delphine is coming.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! that is nothing!” said Bianchon; “he has been talking about his\r\ndaughters all the time. He calls for them as a man impaled calls for\r\nwater, they say----”\r\n\r\n“We may as well give up,” said the physician, addressing the surgeon.\r\n“Nothing more can be done now; the case is hopeless.”\r\n\r\nBianchon and the house surgeon stretched the dying man out again on his\r\nloathsome bed.\r\n\r\n“But the sheets ought to be changed,” added the physician. “Even if\r\nthere is no hope left, something is due to human nature. I shall come\r\nback again, Bianchon,” he said, turning to the medical student. “If he\r\ncomplains again, rub some laudanum over the diaphragm.”\r\n\r\nHe went, and the house surgeon went with him.\r\n\r\n“Come, Eugene, pluck up heart, my boy,” said Bianchon, as soon as they\r\nwere alone; “we must set about changing his sheets, and put him into a\r\nclean shirt. Go and tell Sylvie to bring some sheets and come and help\r\nus to make the bed.”\r\n\r\nEugene went downstairs, and found Mme. Vauquer engaged in setting the\r\ntable; Sylvie was helping her. Eugene had scarcely opened his mouth\r\nbefore the widow walked up to him with the acidulous sweet smile of a\r\ncautious shopkeeper who is anxious neither to lose money nor to offend a\r\ncustomer.\r\n\r\n“My dear Monsieur Eugene,” she said, when he had spoken, “you know quite\r\nas well as I do that Father Goriot has not a brass farthing left. If you\r\ngive out clean linen for a man who is just going to turn up his eyes,\r\nyou are not likely to see your sheets again, for one is sure to be\r\nwanted to wrap him in. Now, you owe me a hundred and forty-four francs\r\nas it is, add forty francs for the pair of sheets, and then there are\r\nseveral little things, besides the candle that Sylvie will give you;\r\naltogether it will all mount up to at least two hundred francs, which is\r\nmore than a poor widow like me can afford to lose. Lord! now, Monsieur\r\nEugene, look at it fairly. I have lost quite enough in these five days\r\nsince this run of ill-luck set in for me. I would rather than ten crowns\r\nthat the old gentlemen had moved out as you said. It sets the other\r\nlodgers against the house. It would not take much to make me send him to\r\nthe workhouse. In short, just put yourself in my place. I have to think\r\nof my establishment first, for I have my own living to make.”\r\n\r\nEugene hurried up to Goriot’s room.\r\n\r\n“Bianchon,” he cried, “the money for the watch?”\r\n\r\n“There it is on the table, or the three hundred and sixty odd francs\r\nthat are left of it. I paid up all the old scores out of it before they\r\nlet me have the things. The pawn ticket lies there under the money.”\r\n\r\nRastignac hurried downstairs.\r\n\r\n“Here, madame” he said in disgust, “let us square accounts. M. Goriot\r\nwill not stay much longer in your house, nor shall I----”\r\n\r\n“Yes, he will go out feet foremost, poor old gentleman,” she said,\r\ncounting the francs with a half-facetious, half-lugubrious expression.\r\n\r\n“Let us get this over,” said Rastignac.\r\n\r\n“Sylvie, look out some sheets, and go upstairs to help the gentlemen.”\r\n\r\n“You won’t forget Sylvie,” said Mme. Vauquer in Eugene’s ear; “she has\r\nbeen sitting up these two nights.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as Eugene’s back was turned, the old woman hurried after her\r\nhandmaid.\r\n\r\n“Take the sheets that have had the sides turned into the middle, number\r\n7. Lord! they are plenty good enough for a corpse,” she said in Sylvie’s\r\near.\r\n\r\nEugene, by this time, was part of the way upstairs, and did not overhear\r\nthe elderly economist.\r\n\r\n“Quick,” said Bianchon, “let us change his shirt. Hold him upright.”\r\n\r\nEugene went to the head of the bed and supported the dying man, while\r\nBianchon drew off his shirt; and then Goriot made a movement as if he\r\ntried to clutch something to his breast, uttering a low inarticulate\r\nmoaning the while, like some dumb animal in mortal pain.\r\n\r\n“Ah! yes!” cried Bianchon. “It is the little locket and the chain\r\nmade of hair that he wants; we took it off a while ago when we put the\r\nblisters on him. Poor fellow! he must have it again. There it lies on\r\nthe chimney-piece.”\r\n\r\nEugene went to the chimney-piece and found the little plait of faded\r\ngolden hair--Mme. Goriot’s hair, no doubt. He read the name on the\r\nlittle round locket, ANASTASIE on the one side, DELPHINE on the other.\r\nIt was the symbol of his own heart that the father always wore on his\r\nbreast. The curls of hair inside the locket were so fine and soft that\r\nis was plain they had been taken from two childish heads. When the old\r\nman felt the locket once more, his chest heaved with a long deep sigh\r\nof satisfaction, like a groan. It was something terrible to see, for it\r\nseemed as if the last quiver of the nerves were laid bare to their eyes,\r\nthe last communication of sense to the mysterious point within whence\r\nour sympathies come and whither they go. A delirious joy lighted up the\r\ndistorted face. The terrific and vivid force of the feeling that had\r\nsurvived the power of thought made such an impression on the students,\r\nthat the dying man felt their hot tears falling on him, and gave a\r\nshrill cry of delight.\r\n\r\n“Nasie! Fifine!”\r\n\r\n“There is life in him yet,” said Bianchon.\r\n\r\n“What does he go on living for?” said Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“To suffer,” answered Rastignac.\r\n\r\nBianchon made a sign to his friend to follow his example, knelt down and\r\npressed his arms under the sick man, and Rastignac on the other side did\r\nthe same, so that Sylvie, standing in readiness, might draw the sheet\r\nfrom beneath and replace it with the one that she had brought. Those\r\ntears, no doubt, had misled Goriot; for he gathered up all his remaining\r\nstrength in a last effort, stretched out his hands, groped for the\r\nstudents’ heads, and as his fingers caught convulsively at their hair,\r\nthey heard a faint whisper:\r\n\r\n“Ah! my angels!”\r\n\r\nTwo words, two inarticulate murmurs, shaped into words by the soul which\r\nfled forth with them as they left his lips.\r\n\r\n“Poor dear!” cried Sylvie, melted by that exclamation; the expression of\r\nthe great love raised for the last time to a sublime height by that most\r\nghastly and involuntary of lies.\r\n\r\nThe father’s last breath must have been a sigh of joy, and in that sigh\r\nhis whole life was summed up; he was cheated even at the last. They laid\r\nFather Goriot upon his wretched bed with reverent hands. Thenceforward\r\nthere was no expression on his face, only the painful traces of the\r\nstruggle between life and death that was going on in the machine; for\r\nthat kind of cerebral consciousness that distinguishes between pleasure\r\nand pain in a human being was extinguished; it was only a question of\r\ntime--and the mechanism itself would be destroyed.\r\n\r\n“He will lie like this for several hours, and die so quietly at last,\r\nthat we shall not know when he goes; there will be no rattle in the\r\nthroat. The brain must be completely suffused.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke there was a footstep on the staircase, and a young woman\r\nhastened up, panting for breath.\r\n\r\n“She has come too late,” said Rastignac.\r\n\r\nBut it was not Delphine; it was Therese, her waiting-woman, who stood in\r\nthe doorway.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Eugene,” she said, “monsieur and madame have had a terrible\r\nscene about some money that Madame (poor thing!) wanted for her father.\r\nShe fainted, and the doctor came, and she had to be bled, calling\r\nout all the while, ‘My father is dying; I want to see papa!’ It was\r\nheartbreaking to hear her----”\r\n\r\n“That will do, Therese. If she came now, it would be trouble thrown\r\naway. M. Goriot cannot recognize any one now.”\r\n\r\n“Poor, dear gentleman, is he as bad at that?” said Therese.\r\n\r\n“You don’t want me now, I must go and look after my dinner; it is\r\nhalf-past four,” remarked Sylvie. The next instant she all but collided\r\nwith Mme. de Restaud on the landing outside.\r\n\r\nThere was something awful and appalling in the sudden apparition of\r\nthe Countess. She saw the bed of death by the dim light of the single\r\ncandle, and her tears flowed at the sight of her father’s passive\r\nfeatures, from which the life had almost ebbed. Bianchon with thoughtful\r\ntact left the room.\r\n\r\n“I could not escape soon enough,” she said to Rastignac.\r\n\r\nThe student bowed sadly in reply. Mme. de Restaud took her father’s hand\r\nand kissed it.\r\n\r\n“Forgive me, father! You used to say that my voice would call you back\r\nfrom the grave; ah! come back for one moment to bless your penitent\r\ndaughter. Do you hear me? Oh! this is fearful! No one on earth will ever\r\nbless me henceforth; every one hates me; no one loves me but you in all\r\nthe world. My own children will hate me. Take me with you, father; I\r\nwill love you, I will take care of you. He does not hear me ... I am\r\nmad...”\r\n\r\nShe fell on her knees, and gazed wildly at the human wreck before her.\r\n\r\n“My cup of misery is full,” she said, turning her eyes upon Eugene.\r\n“M. de Trailles has fled, leaving enormous debts behind him, and I have\r\nfound out that he was deceiving me. My husband will never forgive me,\r\nand I have left my fortune in his hands. I have lost all my illusions.\r\nAlas! I have forsaken the one heart that loved me (she pointed to her\r\nfather as she spoke), and for whom? I have held his kindness cheap,\r\nand slighted his affection; many and many a time I have given him pain,\r\nungrateful wretch that I am!”\r\n\r\n“He knew it,” said Rastignac.\r\n\r\nJust then Goriot’s eyelids unclosed; it was only a muscular contraction,\r\nbut the Countess’ sudden start of reviving hope was no less dreadful\r\nthan the dying eyes.\r\n\r\n“Is it possible that he can hear me?” cried the Countess. “No,” she\r\nanswered herself, and sat down beside the bed. As Mme. de Restaud seemed\r\nto wish to sit by her father, Eugene went down to take a little food.\r\nThe boarders were already assembled.\r\n\r\n“Well,” remarked the painter, as he joined them, “it seems that there is\r\nto be a death-orama upstairs.”\r\n\r\n“Charles, I think you might find something less painful to joke about,”\r\n said Eugene.\r\n\r\n“So we may not laugh here?” returned the painter. “What harm does it do?\r\nBianchon said that the old man was quite insensible.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” said the _employe_ from the Museum, “he will die as he has\r\nlived.”\r\n\r\n“My father is dead!” shrieked the Countess.\r\n\r\nThe terrible cry brought Sylvie, Rastignac, and Bianchon; Mme.\r\nde Restaud had fainted away. When she recovered they carried her\r\ndownstairs, and put her into the cab that stood waiting at the door.\r\nEugene sent Therese with her, and bade the maid take the Countess to\r\nMme. de Nucingen.\r\n\r\nBianchon came down to them.\r\n\r\n“Yes, he is dead,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Come, sit down to dinner, gentlemen,” said Mme. Vauquer, “or the soup\r\nwill be cold.”\r\n\r\nThe two students sat down together.\r\n\r\n“What is the next thing to be done?” Eugene asked of Bianchon.\r\n\r\n“I have closed his eyes and composed his limbs,” said Bianchon. “When\r\nthe certificate has been officially registered at the Mayor’s office,\r\nwe will sew him in his winding sheet and bury him somewhere. What do you\r\nthink we ought to do?”\r\n\r\n“He will not smell at his bread like this any more,” said the painter,\r\nmimicking the old man’s little trick.\r\n\r\n“Oh, hang it all!” cried the tutor, “let Father Goriot drop, and let us\r\nhave something else for a change. He is a standing dish, and we have had\r\nhim with every sauce this hour or more. It is one of the privileges of\r\nthe good city of Paris that anybody may be born, or live, or die there\r\nwithout attracting any attention whatsoever. Let us profit by the\r\nadvantages of civilization. There are fifty or sixty deaths every day;\r\nif you have a mind to do it, you can sit down at any time and wail over\r\nwhole hecatombs of dead in Paris. Father Goriot has gone off the hooks,\r\nhas he? So much the better for him. If you venerate his memory, keep it\r\nto yourselves, and let the rest of us feed in peace.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, to be sure,” said the widow, “it is all the better for him that he\r\nis dead. It looks as though he had had trouble enough, poor soul, while\r\nhe was alive.”\r\n\r\nAnd this was all the funeral oration delivered over him who had been for\r\nEugene the type and embodiment of Fatherhood.\r\n\r\nThe fifteen lodgers began to talk as usual. When Bianchon and Eugene had\r\nsatisfied their hunger, the rattle of spoons and forks, the boisterous\r\nconversation, the expressions on the faces that bespoke various degrees\r\nof want of feeling, gluttony, or indifference, everything about them\r\nmade them shiver with loathing. They went out to find a priest to watch\r\nthat night with the dead. It was necessary to measure their last pious\r\ncares by the scanty sum of money that remained. Before nine o’clock that\r\nevening the body was laid out on the bare sacking of the bedstead in\r\nthe desolate room; a lighted candle stood on either side, and the priest\r\nwatched at the foot. Rastignac made inquiries of this latter as to the\r\nexpenses of the funeral, and wrote to the Baron de Nucingen and the\r\nComte de Restaud, entreating both gentlemen to authorize their man of\r\nbusiness to defray the charges of laying their father-in-law in the\r\ngrave. He sent Christophe with the letters; then he went to bed, tired\r\nout, and slept.\r\n\r\nNext day Bianchon and Rastignac were obliged to take the certificate\r\nto the registrar themselves, and by twelve o’clock the formalities were\r\ncompleted. Two hours went by, no word came from the Count nor from the\r\nBaron; nobody appeared to act for them, and Rastignac had already been\r\nobliged to pay the priest. Sylvie asked ten francs for sewing the old\r\nman in his winding-sheet and making him ready for the grave, and Eugene\r\nand Bianchon calculated that they had scarcely sufficient to pay for the\r\nfuneral, if nothing was forthcoming from the dead man’s family. So it\r\nwas the medical student who laid him in a pauper’s coffin, despatched\r\nfrom Bianchon’s hospital, whence he obtained it at a cheaper rate.\r\n\r\n“Let us play those wretches a trick,” said he. “Go to the cemetery, buy\r\na grave for five years at Pere-Lachaise, and arrange with the Church and\r\nthe undertaker to have a third-class funeral. If the daughters and\r\ntheir husbands decline to repay you, you can carve this on the\r\nheadstone--‘_Here lies M. Goriot, father of the Comtesse de Restaud and\r\nthe Baronne de Nucingen, interred at the expense of two students_.’”\r\n\r\nEugene took part of his friend’s advice, but only after he had gone\r\nin person first to M. and Mme. de Nucingen, and then to M. and Mme. de\r\nRestaud--a fruitless errand. He went no further than the doorstep in\r\neither house. The servants had received strict orders to admit no one.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur and Madame can see no visitors. They have just lost their\r\nfather, and are in deep grief over their loss.”\r\n\r\nEugene’s Parisian experience told him that it was idle to press the\r\npoint. Something clutched strangely at his heart when he saw that it was\r\nimpossible to reach Delphine.\r\n\r\n“Sell some of your ornaments,” he wrote hastily in the porter’s room,\r\n“so that your father may be decently laid in his last resting-place.”\r\n\r\nHe sealed the note, and begged the porter to give it to Therese for her\r\nmistress; but the man took it to the Baron de Nucingen, who flung the\r\nnote into the fire. Eugene, having finished his errands, returned to the\r\nlodging-house about three o’clock. In spite of himself, the tears came\r\ninto his eyes. The coffin, in its scanty covering of black cloth,\r\nwas standing there on the pavement before the gate, on two chairs.\r\nA withered sprig of hyssop was soaking in the holy water bowl of\r\nsilver-plated copper; there was not a soul in the street, not a\r\npasser-by had stopped to sprinkle the coffin; there was not even an\r\nattempt at a black drapery over the wicket. It was a pauper who lay\r\nthere; no one made a pretence of mourning for him; he had neither\r\nfriends nor kindred--there was no one to follow him to the grave.\r\n\r\nBianchon’s duties compelled him to be at the hospital, but he had left\r\na few lines for Eugene, telling his friend about the arrangements he\r\nhad made for the burial service. The house student’s note told Rastignac\r\nthat a mass was beyond their means, that the ordinary office for the\r\ndead was cheaper, and must suffice, and that he had sent word to\r\nthe undertaker by Christophe. Eugene had scarcely finished reading\r\nBianchon’s scrawl, when he looked up and saw the little circular\r\ngold locket that contained the hair of Goriot’s two daughters in Mme.\r\nVauquer’s hands.\r\n\r\n“How dared you take it?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Good Lord! is that to be buried along with him?” retorted Sylvie. “It\r\nis gold.”\r\n\r\n“Of course it shall!” Eugene answered indignantly; “he shall at any\r\nrate take one thing that may represent his daughters into the grave with\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nWhen the hearse came, Eugene had the coffin carried into the house\r\nagain, unscrewed the lid, and reverently laid on the old man’s breast\r\nthe token that recalled the days when Delphine and Anastasie were\r\ninnocent little maidens, before they began “to think for themselves,” as\r\nhe had moaned out in his agony.\r\n\r\nRastignac and Christophe and the two undertaker’s men were the only\r\nfollowers of the funeral. The Church of Saint-Etienne du Mont was only a\r\nlittle distance from the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve. When the coffin\r\nhad been deposited in a low, dark, little chapel, the law student looked\r\nround in vain for Goriot’s two daughters or their husbands. Christophe\r\nwas his only fellow-mourner; Christophe, who appeared to think it was\r\nhis duty to attend the funeral of the man who had put him in the way\r\nof such handsome tips. As they waited there in the chapel for the two\r\npriests, the chorister, and the beadle, Rastignac grasped Christophe’s\r\nhand. He could not utter a word just then.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Monsieur Eugene,” said Christophe, “he was a good and worthy man,\r\nwho never said one word louder than another; he never did any one any\r\nharm, and gave nobody any trouble.”\r\n\r\nThe two priests, the chorister, and the beadle came, and said and did\r\nas much as could be expected for seventy francs in an age when religion\r\ncannot afford to say prayers for nothing.\r\n\r\nThe ecclesiatics chanted a psalm, the _Libera nos_ and the _De\r\nprofundis_. The whole service lasted about twenty minutes. There was but\r\none mourning coach, which the priest and chorister agreed to share with\r\nEugene and Christophe.\r\n\r\n“There is no one else to follow us,” remarked the priest, “so we may as\r\nwell go quickly, and so save time; it is half-past five.”\r\n\r\nBut just as the coffin was put in the hearse, two empty carriages, with\r\nthe armorial bearings of the Comte de Restaud and the Baron de Nucingen,\r\narrived and followed in the procession to Pere-Lachaise. At six o’clock\r\nGoriot’s coffin was lowered into the grave, his daughters’ servants\r\nstanding round the while. The ecclesiastic recited the short prayer that\r\nthe students could afford to pay for, and then both priest and lackeys\r\ndisappeared at once. The two grave diggers flung in several spadefuls of\r\nearth, and then stopped and asked Rastignac for their fee. Eugene\r\nfelt in vain in his pocket, and was obliged to borrow five francs of\r\nChristophe. This thing, so trifling in itself, gave Rastignac a terrible\r\npang of distress. It was growing dusk, the damp twilight fretted his\r\nnerves; he gazed down into the grave and the tears he shed were drawn\r\nfrom him by the sacred emotion, a single-hearted sorrow. When such tears\r\nfall on earth, their radiance reaches heaven. And with that tear that\r\nfell on Father Goriot’s grave, Eugene Rastignac’s youth ended. He folded\r\nhis arms and gazed at the clouded sky; and Christophe, after a glance at\r\nhim, turned and went--Rastignac was left alone.\r\n\r\nHe went a few paces further, to the highest point of the cemetery, and\r\nlooked out over Paris and the windings of the Seine; the lamps were\r\nbeginning to shine on either side of the river. His eyes turned almost\r\neagerly to the space between the column of the Place Vendome and the\r\ncupola of the Invalides; there lay the shining world that he had wished\r\nto reach. He glanced over that humming hive, seeming to draw a foretaste\r\nof its honey, and said magniloquently:\r\n\r\n“Henceforth there is war between us.”\r\n\r\nAnd by way of throwing down the glove to Society, Rastignac went to dine\r\nwith Mme. de Nucingen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDENDUM\r\n\r\nThe following personages appear in other stories of the Human Comedy.\r\n\r\n     Ajuda-Pinto, Marquis Miguel d’\r\n       Scenes from a Courtesan’s Life\r\n       The Secrets of a Princess\r\n       Beatrix\r\n\r\n     Beauseant, Marquis\r\n       An Episode under the Terror\r\n\r\n     Beauseant, Vicomte de\r\n       The Deserted Woman\r\n\r\n     Beauseant, Vicomtesse de\r\n       The Deserted Woman\r\n       Albert Savarus\r\n\r\n     Bianchon, Horace\r\n       The Atheist’s Mass\r\n       Cesar Birotteau\r\n       The Commission in Lunacy\r\n       Lost Illusions\r\n       A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\r\n       A Bachelor’s Establishment\r\n       The Secrets of a Princess\r\n       The Government Clerks\r\n       Pierrette\r\n       A Study of Woman\r\n       Scenes from a Courtesan’s Life\r\n       Honorine\r\n       The Seamy Side of History\r\n       The Magic Skin\r\n       A Second Home\r\n       A Prince of Bohemia\r\n       Letters of Two Brides\r\n       The Muse of the Department\r\n       The Imaginary Mistress\r\n       The Middle Classes\r\n       Cousin Betty\r\n       The Country Parson\r\n     In addition, M.
