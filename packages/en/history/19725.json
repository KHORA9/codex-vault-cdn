SPILLAN, A.M. M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON:\r\n\r\nHENRY G. BOHN, YORK STREET, COVENT GARDEN.\r\nMDCCCLIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN CHILDS AND SON, BUNGAY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this new English version of the most elegant of the Roman historians,\r\nthe object of the translator has been, to adhere as closely to the\r\noriginal text as is consistent with the idioms of the respective\r\nlanguages. But while thus providing more especially for the wants of the\r\nclassical student, he has not been unmindful of the neatness and\r\nperspicuity required to satisfy the English reader.\r\n\r\nThere have been several previous translations of our author, but the\r\nonly one now before the public, or deserving of particular mention, is\r\nthat by Baker, which is undoubtedly a very able performance, and had it\r\nbeen more faithful, would have rendered any other unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe edition used for the present translation is that published at Oxford\r\nunder the superintendence of Travers Twiss, whose carefully revised text\r\nis by far the best extant. The few notes and illustrations which the\r\nlimits of an edition in this popular form permit, are chiefly confined\r\nto the explanation of grammatical difficulties. Historical and\r\nantiquarian illustration is now so abundantly supplied by excellent\r\nManuals and Dictionaries, that it has been deemed unnecessary to swell\r\nthe present volumes by additions in that department.\r\n\r\nAmong the manuals of Roman History which may most advantageously be used\r\nby the student, is Twiss's Epitome of Niebuhr, 2 vols. 8vo, a work\r\nfrequently referred to in these pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF ROME.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _The coming of Æneas into Italy, and his achievements there; the\r\n     reign of Ascanius in Alba, and of the other Sylvian kings. Romulus\r\n     and Remus born. Amulius killed. Romulus builds Rome; forms a\r\n     senate; makes war upon the Sabines; presents the_ opima spolia _to\r\n     Jupiter Feretrius; divides the people into_ curiæ; _his victories;\r\n     is deified. Numa institutes the rites of religious worship; builds\r\n     a temple to Janus; and having made peace with all his neighbours,\r\n     closes it for the first time; enjoys a peaceful reign, and is\r\n     succeeded by Tullus Hostilius. War with the Albans; combat of the\r\n     Horatii and Curiatii. Alba demolished, and the Albans made citizens\r\n     of Rome. War declared against the Sabines; Tullus killed by\r\n     lightning. Ancus Marcius renews the religious institutions of Numa;\r\n     conquers the Latins, confers on them the right of citizenship, and\r\n     assigns them the Aventine hill to dwell on; adds the hill Janiculum\r\n     to the city; enlarges the bounds of the empire. In his reign Lucumo\r\n     comes to Rome; assumes the name of Tarquinius; and, after the death\r\n     of Ancus, is raised to the throne. He increases the senate, by\r\n     adding to it a hundred new senators; defeats the Latins and\r\n     Sabines; augments the centuries of knights; builds a wall round the\r\n     city; makes the common sewers; is slain by the sons of Ancus after\r\n     a reign of thirty-eight years; and is succeeded by Servius Tullius.\r\n     He institutes the census; closes the lustrum, in which eighty\r\n     thousand citizens are said to have been enrolled; divides the\r\n     people into classes and centuries; enlarges the Pomœrium, and\r\n     adds the Quirinal, Viminal, and Esquiline hills to the city; after\r\n     a reign of forty years, is murdered by L. Tarquin, afterwards\r\n     surnamed Superbus. He usurps the crown. Tarquin makes war on the\r\n     Volsci, and, with the plunder taken from them, builds a temple to\r\n     Jupiter Capitolinus. By a stratagem of his son, Sextus Tarquin, he\r\n     reduces the city of Gabii; after a reign of twenty-five years is\r\n     dethroned and banished, in consequence of the forcible violation of\r\n     the person of Lucretia by his son Sextus. L. Junius Brutus and L.\r\n     Tarquinius Collatinus first created consuls._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether in tracing the history of the Roman people, from the foundation\r\nof the city, I shall employ myself to a useful purpose,[1] I am neither\r\nvery certain, nor, if I were, dare I say: inasmuch as I observe, that it\r\nis both an old and hackneyed practice,[2] later authors always supposing\r\nthat they will either adduce something more authentic in the facts, or,\r\nthat they will excel the less polished ancients in their style of\r\nwriting. Be that as it may, it will, at all events, be a satisfaction to\r\nme, that I too have contributed my share[3] to perpetuate the\r\nachievements of a people, the lords of the world; and if, amidst so\r\ngreat a number of historians,[4] my reputation should remain in\r\nobscurity, I may console myself with the celebrity and lustre of those\r\nwho shall stand in the way of my fame. Moreover, the subject is both of\r\nimmense labour, as being one which must be traced back for more than\r\nseven hundred years, and which, having set out from small beginnings,\r\nhas increased to such a degree that it is now distressed by its own\r\nmagnitude. And, to most readers, I doubt not but that the first origin\r\nand the events immediately succeeding, will afford but little pleasure,\r\nwhile they will be hastening to these later times,[5] in which the\r\nstrength of this overgrown people has for a long period been working its\r\nown destruction. I, on the contrary, shall seek this, as a reward of my\r\nlabour, viz. to withdraw myself from the view of the calamities, which\r\nour age has witnessed for so many years, so long as I am reviewing with\r\nmy whole attention these ancient times, being free from every care[6]\r\nthat may distract a writer's mind, though it cannot warp it from the\r\ntruth. The traditions which have come down to us of what happened before\r\nthe building of the city, or before its building was contemplated, as\r\nbeing suitable rather to the fictions of poetry than to the genuine\r\nrecords of history, I have no intention either to affirm or refute. This\r\nindulgence is conceded to antiquity, that by blending things human with\r\ndivine, it may make the origin of cities appear more venerable: and if\r\nany people might be allowed to consecrate their origin, and to ascribe\r\nit to the gods as its authors, such is the renown of the Roman people in\r\nwar, that when they represent Mars, in particular, as their own parent\r\nand that of their founder, the nations of the world may submit to this\r\nas patiently as they submit to their sovereignty.--But in whatever way\r\nthese and such like matters shall be attended to, or judged of, I shall\r\nnot deem of great importance. I would have every man apply his mind\r\nseriously to consider these points, viz. what their life and what their\r\nmanners were; through what men and by what measures, both in peace and\r\nin war, their empire was acquired[7] and extended; then, as discipline\r\ngradually declined, let him follow in his thoughts their morals, at\r\nfirst as slightly giving way, anon how they sunk more and more, then\r\nbegan to fall headlong, until he reaches the present times, when we can\r\nneither endure our vices, nor their remedies. This it is which is\r\nparticularly salutary and profitable in the study of history, that you\r\nbehold instances of every variety of conduct displayed on a conspicuous\r\nmonument; that from thence you may select for yourself and for your\r\ncountry that which you may imitate; thence _note_ what is shameful in\r\nthe undertaking, and shameful in the result, which you may avoid. But\r\neither a fond partiality for the task I have undertaken deceives me, or\r\nthere never was any state either greater, or more moral, or richer in\r\ngood examples, nor one into which luxury and avarice made their entrance\r\nso late, and where poverty and frugality were so much and so long\r\nhonoured; so that the less wealth there was, the less desire was there.\r\nOf late, riches have introduced avarice, and excessive pleasures a\r\nlonging for them, amidst luxury and a passion for ruining ourselves and\r\ndestroying every thing else. But let complaints, which will not be\r\nagreeable even then, when perhaps they will be also necessary, be kept\r\naloof at least from the first stage of commencing so great a work. We\r\nshould rather, if it was usual with us (historians) as it is with poets,\r\nbegin with good omens, vows and prayers to the gods and goddesses to\r\nvouchsafe good success to our efforts in so arduous an undertaking.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"Employ myself to a useful purpose,\"--_facere operæ\r\npretium_, \"to do a thing that is worth the trouble,\"--\"to employ oneself\r\nto a good purpose.\"--See Scheller's Lat.

Claudius carried the Roman arms beyond Italy against\r\nthe Carthaginians; (2) _extended_, from that time till the fall of\r\nCarthage; (3) _sinking_, the times of the Gracchi; (4) _gave way more\r\nand more_, those of Sulla; (5) _precipitate_, those of Cæsar; (6) _the\r\npresent times_, those of Augustus after the battle of\r\nActium.--_Stocker._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow first of all it is sufficiently established that, Troy having been\r\ntaken, the utmost severity was shown to all the other Trojans; but that\r\ntowards two, Æneas and Antenor, the Greeks forbore all the rights of\r\nwar, both in accordance with an ancient tie of hospitality, and because\r\nthey had ever been the advisers of peace, and of the restoration of\r\nHelen--then that Antenor after various vicissitudes came into the\r\ninnermost bay of the Adriatic Sea, with a body of the Heneti, who having\r\nbeen driven from Paphlagonia in consequence of a civil commotion, were\r\nin quest both of a settlement and a leader, their king Pylæmenes having\r\nbeen lost at Troy; and that the Heneti and Trojans, having expelled the\r\nEuganei, who dwelt between the sea and the Alps, took possession of the\r\ncountry; and the place where they first landed is called Troy; from\r\nwhence also the name of Trojan is given to the canton; but the nation in\r\ngeneral is called Veneti: that Æneas was driven from home by a similar\r\ncalamity, but the fates leading him to the founding of a greater empire,\r\nhe came first to Macedonia: that he sailed from thence to Sicily in\r\nquest of a settlement: that from Sicily he made for the Laurentine\r\nterritory; this place also has the name of Troy. When the Trojans,\r\nhaving disembarked there, were driving plunder from the lands,--as being\r\npersons to whom, after their almost immeasurable wandering, nothing was\r\nleft but their arms and ships,--Latinus the king, and the Aborigines,\r\nwho then occupied those places, assembled in arms from the city and\r\ncountry to repel the violence of the new-comers. On this point the\r\ntradition is two-fold: some say, that Latinus, after being overcome in\r\nbattle, made first a peace, and then an alliance with Æneas: others,\r\nthat when the armies were drawn out in battle-array, before the signals\r\nwere sounded, Latinus advanced to the front of the troops and invited\r\nthe leader of the adventurers to a conference. That he then inquired who\r\nthey were, whence (they had come), or by what casualty they had left\r\ntheir home, and in quest of what they had landed on the Laurentine\r\nterritory: after he heard that the host were Trojans, their chief Æneas,\r\nthe son of Anchises and Venus, and that, driven from their own country\r\nand their homes, which had been destroyed by fire, they were seeking a\r\nsettlement and a place for building a town, struck with admiration of\r\nthe noble origin of the nation and of the hero, and their spirit, alike\r\nprepared for peace or war, he confirmed the assurance of future\r\nfriendship by giving his right hand: that upon this a compact was struck\r\nbetween the chiefs, and mutual greetings passed between the armies: that\r\nÆneas was hospitably entertained by Latinus: that Latinus, in the\r\npresence of his household gods, added a family league to the public one,\r\nby giving Æneas his daughter in marriage. This event confirms the\r\nTrojans in the hope of at length terminating their wanderings by a fixed\r\nand permanent settlement. They build a town. Æneas calls it Lavinium,\r\nafter the name of his wife. In a short time, too, a son was the issue of\r\nthe new marriage, to whom his parents gave the name of Ascanius.\r\n\r\n2. The Aborigines and Trojans were soon after attacked together in war.\r\nTurnus, king of the Rutulians, to whom Lavinia had been affianced before\r\nthe coming of Æneas, enraged that a stranger had been preferred to\r\nhimself, made war on Æneas and Latinus together. Neither side came off\r\nfrom that contest with cause for rejoicing. The Rutulians were\r\nvanquished; the victorious Aborigines and Trojans lost their leader\r\nLatinus. Upon this Turnus and the Rutulians, diffident of their\r\nstrength, have recourse to the flourishing state of the Etruscans, and\r\ntheir king Mezentius; who holding his court at Cœre, at that time an\r\nopulent town, being by no means pleased, even from the commencement, at\r\nthe founding of the new city, and then considering that the Trojan power\r\nwas increasing much more than was altogether consistent with the safety\r\nof the neighbouring states, without reluctance joined his forces in\r\nalliance with the Rutulians. Æneas, in order to conciliate the minds of\r\nthe Aborigines to meet the terror of so serious a war, called both\r\nnations Latins, so that they might all be not only under the same laws,\r\nbut also the same name. Nor after that did the Aborigines yield to the\r\nTrojans in zeal and fidelity towards their king Æneas; relying therefore\r\non this disposition of the two nations, who were now daily coalescing\r\nmore and more, although Etruria was so powerful, that it filled with the\r\nfame of its prowess not only the land, but the sea also, through the\r\nwhole length of Italy, from the Alps to the Sicilian Strait, though he\r\nmight have repelled the war by means of fortifications, yet he led out\r\nhis forces to the field. Upon this a battle ensued successful to the\r\nLatins, the last also of the mortal acts of Æneas. He was buried, by\r\nwhatever name human and divine laws require him to be called,[8] on the\r\nbanks of the river Numicius. They call him Jupiter Indiges.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Æneas, being now deified, could not be called by his human\r\nname; and in speaking of his being buried, it would be improper to name\r\nhim by his divine title. _---- Indigetem_. He is called by Dionysius\r\n??????? Te??.]\r\n\r\n3. Ascanius, the son of Æneas, was not yet old enough to take the\r\ngovernment upon him; that government, however, remained secure for him\r\ntill the age of maturity. In the interim, the Latin state and the\r\nkingdom of his grandfather and father was secured for the boy under the\r\nregency of his mother (such capacity was there in Lavinia). I have some\r\ndoubts (for who can state as certain a matter of such antiquity) whether\r\nthis was the Ascanius, or one older than he, born of Creusa before the\r\nfall of Troy, and the companion of his father in his flight from thence,\r\nthe same whom, being called Iulus, the Julian family call the author of\r\ntheir name. This Ascanius, wheresoever and of whatever mother born, (it\r\nis at least certain that he was the son of Æneas,) Lavinium being\r\noverstocked with inhabitants, left that flourishing and, considering\r\nthese times, wealthy city to his mother or step-mother, and built for\r\nhimself a new one at the foot of Mount Alba, which, being extended on\r\nthe ridge of a hill, was, from its situation, called Longa Alba. Between\r\nthe founding of Lavinium and the transplanting this colony to Longa\r\nAlba, about thirty years intervened. Yet its power had increased to such\r\na degree, especially after the defeat of the Etrurians, that not even\r\nupon the death of Æneas, nor after that, during the regency of Lavinia,\r\nand the first essays of the young prince's reign, did Mezentius, the\r\nEtrurians, or any other of its neighbours dare to take up arms against\r\nit. A peace had been concluded between the two nations on these terms,\r\nthat the river Albula, now called Tiber, should be the common boundary\r\nbetween the Etrurians and Latins. After him Sylvius, the son of\r\nAscanius, born by some accident in a wood, ascends the throne. He was\r\nthe father of Æneas Sylvius, who afterwards begot Latinus Sylvius. By\r\nhim several colonies, called the ancient Latins, were transplanted. From\r\nthis time, all the princes, who reigned at Alba, had the surname of\r\nSylvius. From Latinus sprung Alba; from Alba, Atys; from Atys, Capys;\r\nfrom Capys, Capetus; from Capetus, Tiberinus, who, being drowned in\r\ncrossing the river Albula, gave it a name famous with posterity. Then\r\nAgrippa, the son of Tiberinus; after Agrippa, Romulus Silvius ascends\r\nthe throne, in succession to his father. The latter, having been killed\r\nby a thunderbolt, left the kingdom to Aventinus, who being buried on\r\nthat hill, which is now part of the city of Rome, gave his name to it.\r\nAfter him reigns Proca; he begets Numitor and Amulius. To Numitor, his\r\neldest son, he bequeaths the ancient kingdom of the Sylvian family. But\r\nforce prevailed more than the father's will or the respect due to\r\nseniority: for Amulius, having expelled his brother, seizes the kingdom;\r\nhe adds crime to crime, murders his brother's male issue; and under\r\npretence of doing his brother's daughter, Rhea Sylvia, honour, having\r\nmade her a vestal virgin, by obliging her to perpetual virginity he\r\ndeprives her of all hopes of issue.\r\n\r\n4. But, in my opinion, the origin of so great a city, and the\r\nestablishment of an empire next in power to that of the gods, was due to\r\nthe Fates. The vestal Rhea, being deflowered by force, when she had\r\nbrought forth twins, declares Mars to be the father of her illegitimate\r\noffspring, either because she believed it to be so, or because a god was\r\na more creditable author of her offence. But neither gods nor men\r\nprotect her or her children from the king's cruelty: the priestess is\r\nbound and thrown into prison; the children he commands to be thrown into\r\nthe current of the river. By some interposition of providence,[9] the\r\nTiber having overflowed its banks in stagnant pools, did not admit of\r\nany access to the regular bed of the river; and the bearers supposed\r\nthat the infants could be drowned in water however still; thus, as if\r\nthey had effectually executed the king's orders, they expose the boys in\r\nthe nearest land-flood, where now stands the ficus Ruminalis (they say\r\nthat it was called Romularis). The country thereabout was then a vast\r\nwilderness. The tradition is, that when the water, subsiding, had left\r\nthe floating trough, in which the children had been exposed, on dry\r\nground, a thirsty she-wolf, coming from the neighbouring mountains,\r\ndirected her course to the cries of the infants, and that she held down\r\nher dugs to them with so much gentleness, that the keeper of the king's\r\nflock found her licking the boys with her tongue. It is said his name\r\nwas Faustulus; and that they were carried by him to his homestead to be\r\nnursed by his wife Laurentia. Some are of opinion that she was called\r\nLupa among the shepherds, from her being a common prostitute, and that\r\nthis gave rise to the surprising story. The children thus born and thus\r\nbrought up, when arrived at the years of manhood, did not loiter away\r\ntheir time in tending the folds or following the flocks, but roamed and\r\nhunted in the forests. Having by this exercise improved their strength\r\nand courage, they not only encountered wild beasts, but even attacked\r\nrobbers laden with plunder, and afterwards divided the spoil among the\r\nshepherds. And in company with these, the number of their young\r\nassociates daily increasing, they carried on their business and their\r\nsports.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: _Forte quádam divinitus_. ?e?? t??? t???. Plut.]\r\n\r\n5. They say, that the festival of the lupercal, as now celebrated, was\r\neven at that time solemnized on the Palatine hill, which, from\r\nPalanteum, a city of Arcadia, was first called Palatium, and afterwards\r\nMount Palatine. There they say that Evander, who belonged to the tribe\r\nof Arcadians,[10] that for many years before had possessed that country,\r\nappointed the observance of a feast, introduced from Arcadia, in such\r\nmanner, that young men ran about naked in sport and wantonness, doing\r\nhonour to Pan Lycæus, whom the Romans afterwards called Inuus. That the\r\nrobbers, through rage at the loss of their booty, having lain in wait\r\nfor them whilst intent on this sport, as the festival was now well\r\nknown, whilst Romulus vigorously defended himself, took Remus prisoner;\r\nthat they delivered him up, when taken, to king Amulius, accusing him\r\nwith the utmost effrontery. They principally alleged it as a charge\r\nagainst them, that they had made incursions upon Numitor's lands, and\r\nplundered them in a hostile manner, having assembled a band of young men\r\nfor the purpose. Upon this Remus was delivered to Numitor to be\r\npunished. Now, from the very first, Faustulus had entertained hopes that\r\nthe boys whom he was bringing up were of the blood royal; for he both\r\nknew that the children had been exposed by the king's orders, and that\r\nthe time at which he had taken them up agreed exactly with that period:\r\nbut he had been unwilling that the matter, as not being yet ripe for\r\ndiscovery, should be disclosed, till either a fit opportunity or\r\nnecessity should arise. Necessity came first; accordingly, compelled by\r\nfear, he discovers the whole affair to Romulus. By accident also, whilst\r\nhe had Remus in custody, and had heard that the brothers were twins, on\r\ncomparing their age, and _observing_ their turn of mind entirely free\r\nfrom servility, the recollection of his grand-children struck Numitor;\r\nand on making inquiries[11] he arrived at the same conclusion, so that\r\nhe was well nigh recognising Remus. Thus a plot is concerted for the\r\nking on all sides. Romulus, not accompanied by a body of young men, (for\r\nhe was unequal to open force,) but having commanded the shepherds to\r\ncome to the palace by different roads at a fixed time, forces his way to\r\nthe king; and Remus, with another party from Numitor's house, assists\r\nhis brother, and so they kill the king.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Scil. \"The Pallantean.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: By all his inquiries he arrived at the same conclusion as\r\nbefore, viz. that they were his grand-children.]\r\n\r\n6. Numitor, at the beginning of the fray, having given out that enemies\r\nhad invaded the city, and assaulted the palace, after he had drawn off\r\nthe Alban youth to secure the citadel with a garrison and arms, when he\r\nsaw the young men, after they had killed the king, advancing to\r\ncongratulate him, immediately called an assembly of the people, and\r\nrepresented to them the unnatural behaviour of his brother towards him,\r\nthe extraction of his grand-children, the manner of their birth and\r\neducation, and how they came to be discovered; then he informed them of\r\nthe king's death, and that he was killed by his orders. When the young\r\nprinces, coming up with their band through the middle of the assembly,\r\nsaluted their grandfather king, an approving shout, following from all\r\nthe people present, ratified to him both that title and the sovereignty.\r\nThus the government of Alba being committed to Numitor, a desire seized\r\nRomulus and Remus to build a city on the spot where they had been\r\nexposed and brought up. And there was an overflowing population of\r\nAlbans and of Latins. The shepherds too had come into that design, and\r\nall these readily inspired hopes, that Alba and Lavinium would be but\r\npetty places in comparison with the city which they intended to build.\r\nBut ambition of the sovereignty, the bane of their grandfather,\r\ninterrupted these designs, and thence arose a shameful quarrel from a\r\nbeginning sufficiently amicable. For as they were twins, and the respect\r\ndue to seniority could not determine the point, they agreed to leave to\r\nthe tutelary gods of the place to choose, by augury, which should give a\r\nname to the new city, which govern it when built.\r\n\r\n7. Romulus chose the Palatine and Remus the Aventine hill as their\r\nstands to make their observations. It is said, that to Remus an omen\r\ncame first, six vultures; and now, the omen having been declared, when\r\ndouble the number presented itself to Romulus, his own party saluted\r\neach king; the former claimed the kingdom on the ground of priority of\r\ntime, the latter on account of the number of birds. Upon this, having\r\nmet in an altercation, from the contest of angry feelings they turn to\r\nbloodshed; there Remus fell from a blow received in the crowd. A more\r\ncommon account is, that Remus, in derision of his brother, leaped over\r\nhis new-built wall, and was, for that reason, slain by Romulus in a\r\npassion; who, after sharply chiding him, added words to this effect: \"So\r\nshall every one fare, who shall dare to leap over my\r\nfortifications.\"[12] Thus Romulus got the sovereignty to himself; the\r\ncity, when built, was called after the name of its founder. His first\r\nwork was to fortify the Palatine hill where he had been educated. To the\r\nother gods he offers sacrifices according to the Alban rite; to\r\nHercules, according to the Grecian rite, as they had been instituted by\r\nEvander. There is a tradition, that Hercules, having killed Geryon,\r\ndrove his oxen, which were extremely beautiful, into those places; and\r\nthat, after swimming over the Tiber, and driving the cattle before him,\r\nbeing fatigued with travelling, he laid himself down on the banks of the\r\nriver, in a grassy place, to refresh them with rest and rich pasture.\r\nWhen sleep had overpowered him, satiated with food and wine, a shepherd\r\nof the place, named Cacus, presuming on his strength, and charmed with\r\nthe beauty of the oxen, wished to purloin that booty, but because, if he\r\nhad driven them forward into the cave, their footsteps would have guided\r\nthe search of their owner thither, he therefore drew the most beautiful\r\nof them, one by one, by the tails, backwards into a cave. Hercules,\r\nawaking at day-break, when he had surveyed his herd, and observed that\r\nsome of them were missing, goes directly to the nearest cave, to see if\r\nby chance their footsteps would lead him thither. But when he observed\r\nthat they were all turned from it, and directed him no other way,\r\nconfounded, and not knowing what to do, he began to drive his cattle\r\nout of that unlucky place. Upon this, some of the cows, as they usually\r\ndo, lowed on missing those that were left; and the lowings of those that\r\nwere confined being returned from the cave, made Hercules turn that way.\r\nAnd when Cacus attempted to prevent him by force, as he was proceeding\r\nto the cave, being struck with a club, he was slain, vainly imploring\r\nthe assistance of the shepherds. At that time Evander, who had fled from\r\nthe Peloponnesus, ruled this country more by his credit and reputation\r\nthan absolute sway. He was a person highly revered for his wondrous\r\nknowledge of letters,[13] a discovery that was entirely new and\r\nsurprising to men ignorant of every art; but more highly respected on\r\naccount of the supposed divinity of his mother Carmenta, whom these\r\nnations had admired as a prophetess, before the coming of the Sibyl into\r\nItaly. This prince, alarmed by the concourse of the shepherds hastily\r\ncrowding round the stranger, whom they charged with open murder, after\r\nhe heard the act and the cause of the act, observing the person and mien\r\nof the hero to be larger, and his gait more majestic, than human, asked\r\nwho he was? As soon as he was informed of his name, his father, and his\r\nnative country, he said, \"Hail! Hercules! son of Jupiter, my mother, a\r\ntruth-telling interpreter of the gods, has revealed to me, that thou\r\nshalt increase the number of the celestials; and that to thee an altar\r\nshall be dedicated here, which some ages hence the most powerful people\r\non earth shall call Ara Maxima, and honour according to thy own\r\ninstitution.\" Hercules having given him his right hand, said, \"That he\r\naccepted the omen, and would fulfil the predictions of the fates, by\r\nbuilding and consecrating an altar.\" There for the first time a\r\nsacrifice was offered to Hercules of a chosen heifer, taken from the\r\nherd, the Potitii and Pinarii, who were then the most distinguished\r\nfamilies that inhabited these parts, having been invited to the service\r\nand the entertainment. It so happened that the Potitii were present in\r\ndue time, and the entrails were set before them; when they were eaten\r\nup, the Pinarii came to the remainder of the feast. From this time it\r\nwas ordained, that while the Pinarian family subsisted, none of them\r\nshould eat of the entrails of the solemn sacrifices. The Potitii, being\r\ninstructed by Evander, discharged this sacred function as priests for\r\nmany ages, until the office, solemnly appropriated to their family,\r\nbeing delegated to public slaves, their whole race became extinct. This\r\nwas the only foreign religious institution which Romulus adopted, being\r\neven then an abettor of immortality attained by merit, to which his own\r\ndestinies were conducting him.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: According to Cato, Rome was founded on the day of the\r\n_Palilia_, the 11th of the Calends of May, in the first year of the 7th\r\nOlympiad, and 751 B.C. This is two years short of Varro's computation.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: He taught the Italians to read and write.]\r\n\r\n8. The duties of religion having been duly performed, and the multitude\r\nsummoned to a meeting, as they could be incorporated into one people by\r\nno other means than fixed rules, he gave them a code of laws, and\r\njudging that these would be best respected by this rude class of men, if\r\nhe made himself dignified by the insignia of authority, he assumed a\r\nmore majestic appearance both in his other appointments, and especially\r\nby taking twelve lictors to attend him. Some think that he chose this\r\nnumber of officers from that of the birds, which in the augury had\r\nportended the kingdom to him. I do not object to be of the opinion of\r\nthose who will have it that the apparitors (in general), and this\r\nparticular class of them,[14] and even their number, was taken from\r\ntheir neighbours the Etrurians, from whom were borrowed the curule\r\nchair, and the gown edged with purple; and that the Etrurians adopted\r\nthat number, because their king being elected in common from twelve\r\nstates, each state assigned him one lictor. Meanwhile the city increased\r\nby their taking in various lots of ground for buildings, whilst they\r\nbuilt rather with a view to future numbers, than for the population[15]\r\nwhich they then had. Then, lest the size of the city might be of no\r\navail, in order to augment the population, according to the ancient\r\npolicy of the founders of cities, who, after drawing together to them an\r\nobscure and mean multitude, used to feign that their offspring sprung\r\nout of the earth, he opened as a sanctuary, a place which is now\r\nenclosed as you go down \"to the two groves.\"[16] Hither fled from the\r\nneighbouring states, without distinction whether freemen or slaves,\r\ncrowds of all sorts, desirous of change: and this was the first\r\naccession of strength to their rising greatness. When he was now not\r\ndissatisfied with his strength, he next sets about forming some means of\r\ndirecting that strength. He creates one hundred senators, either because\r\nthat number was sufficient, or because there were only one hundred who\r\ncould name their fathers. They certainly were called Fathers, through\r\nrespect, and their descendants, Patricians.[17]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: _Apparitores hoc genus_. There is something incorrect in\r\nthe language of the original here. In my version I have followed\r\nDrakenborch. Walker, in his edition, proposes to read _ut_ for _et_;\r\nthus, _quibus ut apparitores et hoc genus ab Etruscis ---- numerum\r\nquoque ipsum ductum placet, \"who will have it, that as public servants\r\nof this kind, so was their number also, derived from the Etrurians_.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: The population at that time consisted of not more than\r\n3,000 foot, and less than 300 horse. At the death of Romulus, it is said\r\nto have amounted to 46,000 foot and almost 1,000 horse.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: t? µeta?? ?????? t?? te ?ap?t????? ?a? t?? ???a? ?\r\n?a?e?ta? ??? ?at? t?? ??µa??? d???e?t?? µe?????? d???? d??µ??.

And now the Roman state was become so powerful, that it was a match\r\nfor any of the neighbouring nations in war, but, from the paucity of\r\nwomen, its greatness could only last for one age of man; for they had no\r\nhope of issue at home, nor had they any intermarriages with their\r\nneighbours. Therefore, by the advice of the Fathers, Romulus sent\r\nambassadors to the neighbouring states to solicit an alliance and the\r\nprivilege of intermarriage for his new subjects. \"That cities, like\r\nevery thing else, rose from very humble beginnings. That those which the\r\ngods and their own merit aided, gained great power and high renown. That\r\nhe knew full well, both that the gods had aided the origin of Rome, and\r\nthat merit would not be wanting. Wherefore that, as men, they should\r\nfeel no reluctance to mix their blood and race with men.\" No where did\r\nthe embassy obtain a favourable hearing: so much did they at the same\r\ntime despise, and dread for themselves and their posterity, so great a\r\npower growing up in the midst of them. They were dismissed by the\r\ngreater part with the repeated question, \"Whether they had opened any\r\nasylum for women also, for that such a plan only could obtain them\r\nsuitable matches?\" The Roman youth resented this conduct bitterly, and\r\nthe matter unquestionably began to point towards violence. Romulus, in\r\norder that he might afford a favourable time and place for this,\r\ndissembling his resentment, purposely prepares games in honour of\r\nNeptunus Equestris; he calls them Consualia. He then orders the\r\nspectacle to be proclaimed among their neighbours; and they prepare for\r\nthe celebration with all the magnificence they were then acquainted\r\nwith, or were capable of doing, that they might render the matter\r\nfamous, and an object of expectation. Great numbers assembled, from a\r\ndesire also of seeing the new city; especially their nearest neighbours,\r\nthe Cæninenses, Crustumini, and Antemnates. Moreover the whole multitude\r\nof the Sabines came, with their wives and children. Having been\r\nhospitably invited to the different houses, when they had seen the\r\nsituation, and fortifications, and the city crowded with houses, they\r\nbecame astonished that the Roman power had increased so rapidly. When\r\nthe time of the spectacle came on, and while their minds and eyes were\r\nintent upon it, according to concert a tumult began, and upon a signal\r\ngiven the Roman youth ran different ways to carry off the virgins by\r\nforce. A great number were carried off at hap-hazard, according as they\r\nfell into their hands. Persons from the common people, who had been\r\ncharged with the task, conveyed to their houses some women of surpassing\r\nbeauty, destined for the leading senators. They say that one, far\r\ndistinguished beyond the others for stature and beauty, was carried off\r\nby the party of one Thalassius, and whilst many inquired to whom they\r\nwere carrying her, they cried out every now and then, in order that no\r\none might molest her, that she was being taken to Thalassius; that from\r\nthis circumstance this term became a nuptial one. The festival being\r\ndisturbed by this alarm, the parents of the young women retire in grief,\r\nappealing to the compact of violated hospitality, and invoking the god,\r\nto whose festival and games they had come, deceived by the pretence of\r\nreligion and good faith. Neither had the ravished virgins better hopes\r\nof their condition, or less indignation. But Romulus in person went\r\nabout and declared, \"That what was done was owing to the pride of their\r\nfathers, who had refused to grant the privilege of marriage to their\r\nneighbours; but notwithstanding, they should be joined in lawful\r\nwedlock, participate in all their possessions and civil privileges, and,\r\nthan which nothing can be dearer to the human heart, in their common\r\nchildren. He begged them only to assuage the fierceness of their anger,\r\nand cheerfully surrender their affections to those to whom fortune had\r\nconsigned their persons.\" [He added,] \"That from injuries love and\r\nfriendship often arise; and that they should find them kinder husbands\r\non this account, because each of them, besides the performance of his\r\nconjugal duty, would endeavour to the utmost of his power to make up for\r\nthe want of their parents and native country.\" To this the caresses of\r\nthe husbands were added, excusing what they had done on the plea of\r\npassion and love, arguments that work most successfully on women's\r\nhearts.\r\n\r\n10. The minds of the ravished virgins were soon much soothed, but their\r\nparents by putting on mourning, and tears and complaints, roused the\r\nstates. Nor did they confine their resentment to their own homes, but\r\nthey flocked from all quarters to Titus Tatius, king of the Sabines; and\r\nbecause he bore the greatest character in these parts, embassies were\r\nsent to him. The Cæninenses, Crustumini, and Antemnates were people to\r\nwhom a considerable portion of the outrage extended. To them Tatius and\r\nthe Sabines seemed to proceed somewhat dilatorily. Nor even do the\r\nCrustumini and Antemnates bestir themselves with sufficient activity to\r\nsuit the impatience and rage of the Cæninenses. Accordingly the state of\r\nthe Cæninenses by itself makes an irruption into the Roman territory.\r\nBut Romulus with his army met them ravaging the country in straggling\r\nparties, and by a slight engagement convinces them, that resentment\r\nwithout strength is of no avail. He defeats and routs their army,\r\npursues it when routed, kills and despoils their king in battle, and\r\nhaving slain their general takes the city at the first assault. From\r\nthence having led back his victorious army, and being a man highly\r\ndistinguished by his exploits, and one who could place them in the best\r\nlight, went in state to the capitol, carrying before him, suspended on a\r\nframe curiously wrought for that purpose, the spoils of the enemy's\r\ngeneral, whom he had slain, and there after he had laid them down at the\r\nfoot of an oak held sacred by the shepherds, together with the offering,\r\nhe marked out the bounds for a temple of Jupiter, and gave a surname to\r\nthe god: \"Jupiter Feretrius,\" he says, \"I, king Romulus, upon my\r\nvictory, present to thee these royal arms, and to thee I dedicate a\r\ntemple within those regions which I have now marked out in my mind, as a\r\nreceptacle for the grand spoils, which my successors, following my\r\nexample, shall, upon their killing the kings or generals of the enemy,\r\noffer to thee.\" This is the origin of that temple, the first consecrated\r\nat Rome. It afterwards so pleased the gods both that the declaration of\r\nthe founder of the temple should not be frustrated, by which he\r\nannounced that his posterity should offer such spoils, and that the\r\nglory of that offering should not be depreciated by the great number of\r\nthose who shared it. During so many years, and amid so many wars since\r\nthat time, grand spoils have been only twice gained,[18] so rare has\r\nbeen the successful attainment of that honour.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Two, one by A. Cornelius Cossus for slaying L. Tolumnius,\r\nking of Veii, U. C. 318, another by M. Claudius Marcellus, for killing\r\nViridomarus, king of the Gauls, U. C. 532.]\r\n\r\n11. Whilst the Romans are achieving these exploits, the army of the\r\nAntemnates, taking advantage of their absence, makes an incursion into\r\nthe Roman territories in a hostile manner. A Roman legion being marched\r\nout in haste against these also, surprise them whilst straggling through\r\nthe fields. Accordingly the enemy were routed at the very first shout\r\nand charge: their town taken; and as Romulus was returning, exulting for\r\nthis double victory, his consort, Hersilia, importuned by the entreaties\r\nof the captured women, beseeches him \"to pardon their fathers, and to\r\nadmit them to the privilege of citizens; that thus his power might be\r\nstrengthened by a reconciliation.\" Her request was readily granted.\r\nAfter this he marched against the Crustumini, who were commencing\r\nhostilities; but as their spirits were sunk by the defeat of their\r\nneighbours, there was still less resistance there. Colonies were sent to\r\nboth places, but more were found to give in their names for Crustuminum,\r\nbecause of the fertility of the soil. Migrations in great numbers were\r\nalso made from thence to Rome, chiefly by the parents and relatives of\r\nthe ravished women. The last war broke out on the part of the Sabines,\r\nand proved by far the most formidable: for they did nothing through\r\nanger or cupidity; nor did they make a show of war, before they actually\r\nbegan it. To prudence stratagem also was added. Sp. Tarpeius commanded\r\nthe Roman citadel; Tatius bribes his maiden daughter with gold, to admit\r\narmed soldiers into the citadel: she had gone by chance outside the\r\nwalls to fetch water for the sacrifice. Those who were admitted crushed\r\nher to death by heaping their arms upon her; either that the citadel\r\nmight seem rather to have been taken by storm, or for the purpose of\r\nestablishing a precedent, that no faith should, under any circumstances,\r\nbe kept with a traitor. A story is added, that the Sabines commonly wore\r\non their left arm golden bracelets of great weight, and large rings set\r\nwith precious stones, and that she bargained with them for what they had\r\non their left hands; hence that their shields were thrown upon her\r\ninstead of the golden presents. There are some who say that in pursuance\r\nof the compact to deliver up what was on their left hands, she expressly\r\ndemanded their shields, and that appearing to act with treachery, she\r\nwas killed by the reward of her own choosing.\r\n\r\n12. The Sabines, however, kept possession of the citadel, and on the day\r\nafter, when the Roman army, drawn up in order of battle, filled up all\r\nthe ground lying between the Palatine and Capitoline hills, they did not\r\ndescend from thence into the plain, till the Romans, fired with\r\nresentment, and with a desire of retaking the citadel, advanced to\r\nattack them. Two chiefs, one on each side, animated the battle, viz.\r\nMettus Curtius on the part of the Sabines, Hostus Hostilius on that of\r\nthe Romans. The latter, in the front ranks, supported the Roman cause by\r\nhis courage and bravery, on disadvantageous ground. As soon as Hostus\r\nfell, the Roman line immediately gave way and was beaten to the old gate\r\nof the Palatium. Romulus, himself too carried away with the general\r\nrout, raising his arms to heaven, says, \"O Jupiter, commanded by thy\r\nbirds, I here laid the first foundation of the city on the Palatine\r\nhill. The Sabines are in possession of the citadel, purchased by fraud.\r\nFrom thence they are now advancing hither, sword in hand, having already\r\npassed the middle of the valley. But do thou, father of gods and men,\r\nkeep back the enemy at least from hence, dispel the terror of the\r\nRomans, and stop their shameful flight. Here I solemnly vow to build a\r\ntemple to thee as Jupiter Stator, as a monument to posterity, that this\r\ncity was saved by thy immediate aid.\" Having offered up this prayer, as\r\nif he had felt that his prayers were heard, he cries out, \"At this spot,\r\nRomans, Jupiter, supremely good and great, commands you to halt, and\r\nrenew the fight.\" The Romans halted as if they had been commanded by a\r\nvoice from heaven; Romulus himself flies to the foremost ranks. Mettus\r\nCurtius, on the part of the Sabines, had rushed down at the head of his\r\narmy from the citadel, and driven the Romans in disorder over the whole\r\nground now occupied by the forum. He was already not far from the gate\r\nof the Palatium, crying out, \"We have defeated these perfidious\r\nstrangers, these dastardly enemies. They now feel that it is one thing\r\nto ravish virgins, another far different to fight with men.\" On him,\r\nthus vaunting, Romulus makes an attack with a band of the most\r\ncourageous youths. It happened that Mettus was then fighting on\r\nhorseback; he was on that account the more easily repulsed: the Romans\r\npursue him when repulsed: and the rest of the Roman army, encouraged by\r\nthe gallant behaviour of their king, routs the Sabines. Mettus, his\r\nhorse taking fright at the din of his pursuers, threw himself into a\r\nlake; and this circumstance drew the attention of the Sabines at the\r\nrisk of so important a person. He, however, his own party beckoning and\r\ncalling to him, acquires new courage from the affection of his many\r\nfriends, and makes his escape. The Romans and Sabines renew the battle\r\nin the valley between the hills; but Roman prowess had the advantage.\r\n\r\n13. At this juncture the Sabine women, from the outrage on whom the war\r\noriginated, with hair dishevelled and garments rent, the timidity of\r\ntheir sex being overcome by such dreadful scenes, had the courage to\r\nthrow themselves amid the flying weapons, and making a rush across, to\r\npart the incensed armies, and assuage their fury; imploring their\r\nfathers on the one side, their husbands on the other, \"that as\r\nfathers-in-law and sons-in-law they would not contaminate each other\r\nwith impious blood, nor stain their offspring with parricide, the one\r\n[19]their grandchildren, the other their children. If you are\r\ndissatisfied with the affinity between you, if with our marriages, turn\r\nyour resentment against us; we are the cause of war, we of wounds and of\r\nbloodshed to our husbands and parents. It were better that we perish\r\nthan live widowed or fatherless without one or other of you.\" The\r\ncircumstance affects both the multitude and the leaders. Silence and a\r\nsudden suspension ensue. Upon this the leaders come forward in order to\r\nconcert a treaty, and they not only conclude a peace, but form one state\r\nout of two. They associate the regal power, and transfer the entire\r\nsovereignty to Rome. The city being thus doubled, that some compliment\r\nmight be paid to the Sabines, they were called Quirites, from Cures. As\r\na memorial of this battle, they called the place where the horse, after\r\ngetting out of the deep marsh, first set Curtius in shallow water, the\r\nCurtian Lake. This happy peace following suddenly a war so distressing,\r\nrendered the Sabine women still dearer to their husbands and parents,\r\nand above all to Romulus himself. Accordingly, when he divided the\r\npeople into thirty curiæ, he called the curiæ by their names. Since,\r\nwithout doubt, the number of the Sabine women was considerably greater\r\nthan this, it is not recorded whether those who were to give their names\r\nto the curiæ were selected on account of their age, or their own or\r\ntheir husbands' rank, or by lot. At the same time three centuries of\r\nknights were enrolled, called Ramnenses, from Romulus; Tatienses, from\r\nTitus Tatius. The reason of the name and origin of the Luceres is\r\nuncertain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: _Nepotum et liberûm progeniem_ = Nepotes et\r\nliberos,--??e? ??a??? = ?? ??a???.]\r\n\r\n14. Thenceforward the two kings held the regal power not only in common,\r\nbut in concord also. Several years after, some relatives of king Tatius\r\nbeat the ambassadors of the Laurentes, and when the Laurentes commenced\r\nproceedings according to the law of nations, the influence of his\r\nfriends and their importunities had more weight with Tatius. He\r\ntherefore drew upon himself the punishment due to them; for he is slain\r\nat Lavinium, in a tumult which arose on his going thither to an\r\nanniversary sacrifice. They say that Romulus resented this with less\r\nseverity than the case required, either by reason of their association\r\nin the kingly power being devoid of cordiality, or because he believed\r\nthat he was justly killed. He therefore declined going to war; in order,\r\nhowever, that the ill-treatment of the ambassadors and the murder of the\r\nking might be expiated, the treaty was renewed between the cities of\r\nRome and Lavinium. With this party, indeed, peace continued, contrary to\r\nexpectation; another war broke out much nearer home, and almost at the\r\nvery gates. The Fidenates, thinking that a power too near to themselves\r\nwas growing to a height, resolve to make war, before their strength\r\nshould become as great as it was apparent it would be. An armed body of\r\nyoung men being sent in, all the land is laid waste between the city and\r\nFidenæ. Then turning to the left, because the Tiber confined them on the\r\nright, they continue their depredations to the great consternation of\r\nthe peasantry. The sudden alarm reaching the city from the country,\r\nserved as the first announcement. Romulus, roused at this circumstance,\r\n(for a war so near home could not admit of delay,) leads out his army:\r\nhe pitches his camp a mile from Fidenæ. Having left there a small\r\ngarrison, marching out with all his forces, he commanded a party of his\r\nsoldiers to lie in ambush in a place [20]hidden by thick bushes which\r\nwere planted around. Then advancing with the greater part of the foot\r\nand all the horse, and riding up to the very gates of the city in a\r\ndisorderly and menacing manner, he drew out the enemy, the very thing he\r\nwanted. The same mode of fighting on the part of the cavalry likewise\r\nmade the cause of the flight, which was to be counterfeited, appear less\r\nsurprising: and when, the horse seeming irresolute, as if in\r\ndeliberation whether to fight or fly, the infantry also retreated, the\r\nenemy suddenly rushed from the crowded gates, after they had made an\r\nimpression on the Roman line, are drawn on to the place of ambuscade in\r\ntheir eagerness to press on and pursue. Upon this the Romans, rising\r\nsuddenly, attack the enemy's line in flank. The standards of those who\r\nhad been left behind on guard, advancing from the camp, further increase\r\nthe panic. The Fidenates, thus dismayed with terrors from so many\r\nquarters, turn their backs almost before Romulus, and those who had\r\naccompanied him on horseback, could wheel their horses round; and those\r\nwho a little before had pursued men pretending to fly, now ran back to\r\nthe town in much greater disorder, for their flight was in earnest. They\r\ndid not however get clear of the enemy: the Romans pressing on their\r\nrear rush in as it were in one body before the gates could be shut\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: The original has undergone various changes here: my\r\nversion coincides with the reading, _locis circà densa obsita virgulta\r\nobscuris_.]\r\n\r\n15. The minds of the Veientes being excited by the contagious influence\r\nof the Fidenatian war, both from the tie of consanguinity, for the\r\nFidenates also were Etrurians, and because the very proximity of\r\nsituation, in case the Roman arms should be turned against all their\r\nneighbours, urged them on, they made an incursion on the Roman\r\nterritories, more to commit depredations than after the manner of a\r\nregular war. Accordingly, without pitching a camp, or awaiting the\r\napproach of the enemy's army, they returned to Veii, carrying with them\r\nthe booty collected from the lands; the Roman army on the other side,\r\nwhen they did not find the enemy in the country, being prepared for and\r\ndetermined on a decisive action, cross the Tiber. And when the Veientes\r\nheard that they were pitching a camp, and intended to advance to the\r\ncity, they came out to meet them, that they might rather decide the\r\nmatter in the open field, than be shut up and fight from their houses\r\nand walls. Here the Roman king obtained the victory, his power not being\r\naided by any stratagem, merely by the strength of his veteran army: and\r\nhaving pursued the routed enemies to their walls, he made no attempt on\r\nthe city, strong as it was by its fortifications, and well defended by\r\nits situation: on his return he lays waste their lands, rather from a\r\ndesire of revenge than booty. And the Veientes, being humbled by that\r\nloss no less than by the unsuccessful battle, send ambassadors to Rome\r\nto sue for peace. A truce for one hundred years was granted them after\r\nthey were fined a part of their land. These are the principal\r\ntransactions which occurred during the reign of Romulus, in peace and\r\nwar, none of which seem inconsistent with the belief of his divine\r\noriginal, or of the deification attributed to him after death, neither\r\nhis spirit in recovering his grandfather's kingdom, nor his project of\r\nbuilding a city, nor that of strengthening it by the arts of war and\r\npeace. For by the strength attained from that outset under him, it\r\nbecame so powerful, that for forty years after it enjoyed a profound\r\npeace. He was, however, dearer to the people than to the fathers; but\r\nabove all others he was most beloved by the soldiers. And he kept three\r\nhundred of them armed as a body-guard not only in war but in peace, whom\r\nhe called Celeres.\r\n\r\n16. After performing these immortal achievements, while he was holding\r\nan assembly of the people for reviewing his army, in the plain near the\r\nlake of Capra, on a sudden a storm having arisen, with great thunder and\r\nlightning, enveloped the king in so dense a mist, that it took all sight\r\nof him from the assembly. Nor was Romulus after this seen on earth. The\r\nconsternation being at length over, and fine clear weather succeeding so\r\nturbulent a day, when the Roman youth saw the royal seat empty, though\r\nthey readily believed the fathers who had stood nearest him, that he was\r\ncarried aloft by the storm, yet, struck with the dread as it were of\r\norphanage, they preserved a sorrowful silence for a considerable time.\r\nThen, a commencement having been made by a few, the whole multitude\r\nsalute Romulus a god, son of a god, the king and parent of the Roman\r\ncity; they implore his favour with prayers, that he would be pleased\r\nalways propitiously to preserve his own offspring. I believe that even\r\nthen there were some, who silently surmised that the king had been torn\r\nin pieces by the hands of the fathers; for this rumour also spread, but\r\nwas not credited; their admiration of the man, and the consternation\r\nfelt at the moment, attached importance to the other report. By the\r\ncontrivance also of one individual, additional credit is said to have\r\nbeen gained to the matter. For Proculus Julius, whilst the state was\r\nstill troubled with regret for the king, and felt incensed against the\r\nsenators, a person of weight, as we are told, in any matter however\r\nimportant, comes forward to the assembly, \"Romans,\" he says, \"Romulus,\r\nthe father of this city, suddenly descending from heaven, appeared to me\r\nthis day at day-break. While I stood covered with awe, and filled with a\r\nreligious dread, beseeching him to allow me to see him face to face, he\r\nsaid, Go tell the Romans, that the gods so will, that my Rome should\r\nbecome the capitol of the world. Therefore let them cultivate the art of\r\nwar, and let them know and hand down to posterity, that no human power\r\nshall be able to withstand the Roman arms. Having said this, he ascended\r\nup to heaven.\" It is surprising what credit was given to the man on his\r\nmaking this announcement, and how much the regret of the common people\r\nand army, for the loss of Romulus, was assuaged upon the assurance of\r\nhis immortality.\r\n\r\n17. Meanwhile ambition and contention for the throne actuated the minds\r\nof the fathers; factions had not yet sprung up from individuals,\r\nbecause, among a new people, no one person was eminently distinguished\r\nabove the rest: the contest was carried on between the different orders.\r\nThe descendants of the Sabines wished a king to be elected out of their\r\nbody, lest, because there had been no king on their side since the death\r\nof Tatius, they might lose their claim to the crown[21] according to the\r\ncompact of equal participation. The old Romans spurned the idea of a\r\nforeign prince. Amid this diversity of views, however, all were anxious\r\nthat there should be a king, they not having yet tasted the sweets of\r\nliberty. Fear then seized the senators, lest the minds of the\r\nsurrounding states being incensed against them, some foreign power\r\nshould attack the state, now without a government, and the army without\r\na leader. It was therefore their wish that there should be some head,\r\nbut no one could bring himself to give way to another. Thus the hundred\r\nsenators divide the government among them, ten decuries being formed,\r\nand one selected from each decury, who was to have the chief direction\r\nof affairs. Ten governed; one only was attended with the insignia of\r\nauthority and the lictors: their power was limited to the space of five\r\ndays, and it passed through all in rotation, and the interval between a\r\nkingly government lasted a year. From the circumstance it was called an\r\nInterregnum, a term which holds good even now. But the people began to\r\nmurmur, that their slavery was multiplied, and that they had got a\r\nhundred sovereigns instead of one, and they seemed determined to bear no\r\nauthority but that of a king, and that one of their own choosing. When\r\nthe fathers perceived that such schemes were in agitation, thinking it\r\nadvisable to offer them, of their own accord, what they were sure to\r\nlose; they thus conciliate the favour of the people by yielding to them\r\nthe supreme power, yet in such a manner as to grant them no greater\r\nprivilege than they reserved to themselves. For they decreed, that when\r\nthe people should choose a king, the election should be valid, if the\r\nsenate approved. And[22] the same forms are observed at this day in\r\npassing laws and electing magistrates, though their efficacy has been\r\ntaken away; for before the people begin to vote, the senators declare\r\ntheir approbation, whilst the result of the elections is still\r\nuncertain. Then the interrex, having called an assembly of the people,\r\naddressed them in this manner: \"Do you, Romans, choose yourselves a\r\nking, and may it prove fortunate, happy, and auspicious to you; so the\r\nfathers have determined. Then, if you choose a prince worthy to succeed\r\nRomulus, the fathers will confirm your choice.\" This concession was so\r\npleasing to the people, that, not to be outdone in generosity, they only\r\nvoted, and required that the senate should determine who should be king\r\nof Rome.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: Although, according to the terms of the alliance, the\r\nSabines and the Romans were to be in all respects on an equal footing.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: The order of the people still requires the sanction of the\r\nsenate for its ratification: but that sanction now being given\r\nbeforehand, the order of the people is no longer subject to the control\r\nof the senate, and therefore not precarious as heretofore.]\r\n\r\n18. The justice and piety of Numa Pompilius was at that time celebrated.\r\nHe dwelt at Cures, a city of the Sabines, and was as eminently learned\r\nin all laws human and divine, as any man could be in that age. They\r\nfalsely represent that Pythagoras of Samos was his instructor in\r\nphilosophy, because there appears no other person to refer to. Now it is\r\ncertain that this philosopher, in the reign of Servius Tullius, more\r\nthan a hundred years after this, held assemblies of young men, who\r\neagerly imbibed his doctrine, in the most distant part of Italy, about\r\nMetapontus, Heraclea, and Croton. But [23]from these places, even had he\r\nflourished at the same time, what fame of his (extending) to the Sabines\r\ncould have aroused any one to a desire of learning, or by what\r\nintercourse of language (could such a thing have been effected)?\r\nBesides, how could a single man have safely passed through so many\r\nnations differing in language and customs? I presume, therefore, that\r\nhis mind was naturally furnished with virtuous dispositions, and that he\r\nwas not so much versed in foreign sciences as in the severe and rigid\r\ndiscipline of the ancient Sabines, than which class none was in former\r\ntimes more strict. The Roman fathers, upon hearing the name of Numa,\r\nalthough they perceived that the scale of power would incline to the\r\nSabines if a king were chosen from them, yet none of them ventured to\r\nprefer himself, or any other of his party, or any of the citizens or\r\nfathers, to that person, but unanimously resolved that the kingdom\r\nshould be conferred on Numa Pompilius. Being sent for, just as Romulus\r\nbefore the building of the city obtained the throne by an augury, he\r\ncommanded the gods to be consulted concerning himself also. Upon this,\r\nbeing conducted into the citadel by an augur, (to which profession that\r\noffice was made a public one and perpetual by way of honour,) he sat\r\ndown on a stone facing the south: the augur took his seat on his left\r\nhand with his head covered, holding in his right a crooked wand free\r\nfrom knots, which they called _lituus_; then taking a view towards the\r\ncity and country, after offering a prayer to the gods, he marked out the\r\nregions from east to west, the parts towards the south he called the\r\nright, those towards the north, the left; and in front of him he set out\r\nin his mind a sign as far as ever his eye could reach. Then having\r\nshifted the lituus into his left hand, placing his right hand on the\r\nhead of Numa, he prayed in this manner: \"O father Jupiter, if it is thy\r\nwill that this Numa Pompilius, whose head I hold, should be king of\r\nRome, I beseech thee to give sure and evident signs of it within those\r\nbounds which I have marked.\" Then he stated in set terms the omens which\r\nhe wished to be sent; and on their being sent, Numa was declared king\r\nand came down from the stand.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: _Ex quibus locis, quæ fama in Sabinos, aut quo linguæ\r\ncommercio ---- quenquam excivisset_. \"From which (remote) places, what\r\nhigh character of him (could have reached) to the Sabines, or by what\r\nintercourse of language could such high character of him have aroused\r\nany one to become a pupil?\" Other editions read _quâ famâ_; thus, from\r\nwhich places by what high character for talent, or by what intercourse\r\nof language, could he, Pythagoras, have aroused any one, etc.?]\r\n\r\n19. Having thus obtained the kingdom, he sets about establishing anew,\r\non the principles of laws and morals, the city recently established by\r\nviolence and arms. When he saw that their minds, as having been rendered\r\nferocious by military life, could not be reconciled to those principles\r\nduring the continuance of wars, considering that a fierce people should\r\nbe mollified by the disuse of arms, he erected at the foot of Argiletum\r\na temple of Janus, as an index of peace and war; that when open, it\r\nmight show the state was engaged in war, and when shut, that all the\r\nneighbouring nations were at peace with it. Twice only since the reign\r\nof Numa hath this temple been shut; once when T. Manlius was consul, at\r\nthe end of the first Punic war; and a second time, which the gods\r\ngranted our age to see, by the emperor Augustus Cæsar, after the battle\r\nof Actium, peace being established by sea and land. This being shut,\r\nafter he had secured the friendship of the neighbouring states around by\r\nalliance and treaties, all anxiety regarding dangers from abroad being\r\nremoved, lest their minds, which the fear of enemies and military\r\ndiscipline had kept in check, should become licentious by tranquillity,\r\nhe considered, that, first of all, an awe of the gods should be\r\ninstilled into them, a principle of the greatest efficacy with a\r\nmultitude ignorant and uncivilized as in those times. But as it could\r\nnot sink deeply into their minds without some fiction of a miracle, he\r\npretends that he holds nightly interviews with the goddess Egeria; that\r\nby her direction he instituted the sacred rites which would be most\r\nacceptable to the gods, and appointed proper priests for each of the\r\ndeities. And, first of all, he divides the year into twelve months,\r\naccording to the course of the moon; and because the moon does not make\r\nup thirty days in each month, and some days are wanting to the complete\r\nyear as constituted by the solstitial revolution, he so portioned it out\r\nby inserting intercalary months, that every twenty-fourth year, the\r\nlengths of all the intermediate years being completed, the days should\r\ncorrespond to the same place of the sun (in the heavens) whence they had\r\nset out.[24] He likewise made a distinction of the days[25] into\r\nprofane and sacred, because on some it was likely to be expedient that\r\nno business should be transacted with the people.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: Romulus had made his year to consist of ten months, the\r\nfirst month being March, and the number of days in the year being only\r\n304, which corresponded neither with the course of the sun or moon.\r\nNuma, who added the two months of January and February, divided the year\r\ninto twelve months, according to the course of the moon. This was the\r\nlunar Greek year, and consisted of 354 days. Numa, however, adopted 355\r\ndays for his year, from his partiality to odd numbers. The lunar year of\r\n354 days fell short of the solar year by 11-1/4 days;--this in 8 years\r\namounted to (11-1/4 × 8) 90 days. These 90 days he divided into 2 months\r\nof 22 and 2 of 23 days, ([2 × 22] + [2 × 23] = 90,) and introduced them\r\nalternately every second year for two octennial periods: every third\r\noctennial period, however, Numa intercalated only 66 days instead of 90\r\ndays, _i. e._ he inserted 3 months of only 22 days each. The reason was,\r\nbecause he adopted 355 days as the length of his lunar year instead of\r\n354, and this in 24 years (3 octennial periods) produced an error of 24\r\ndays; this error was exactly compensated by intercalating only 66 days\r\n(90-24) in the third octennial period. The intercalations were generally\r\nmade in the month of February, after the 23rd of the month. Their\r\nmanagement was left to the pontiffs--_ad metam eandem solis unde orsi\r\nessent_--_dies congruerent_; \"that the days might correspond to the same\r\nstarting-point of the sun in the heavens whence they had set out.\" That\r\nis, taking for instance the tropic of Cancer for the place or\r\nstarting-point of the sun any one year, and observing that he was in\r\nthat point of the heavens on precisely the 21st of June, the object was\r\nso to dispense the year, that the day on which the sun was observed to\r\narrive at that same _meta_ or starting-point again, should also be\r\ncalled the 21st of June:--such was the _congruity_ aimed at by these\r\nintercalations.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25:\r\n\r\n    _Ille nefastus erit per quem tria verba silentur;\r\n    Fastus erit, per quem lege licebit agi._--Ov. F. i. 47.\r\n]\r\n\r\n20. Next he turned his attention to the appointment of priests, though\r\nhe performed many sacred rites himself, especially those which now\r\nbelong to the flamen of Jupiter. But, as he imagined that in a warlike\r\nnation there would be more kings resembling Romulus than Numa, and that\r\nthey would go to war in person, he appointed a residentiary priest as\r\nflamen to Jupiter, that the sacred functions of the royal office might\r\nnot be neglected, and he distinguished him by a fine robe, and a royal\r\ncurule chair. To him he added two other flamines, one for Mars, another\r\nfor Quirinus. He also selected virgins for Vesta, a priesthood derived\r\nfrom Alba, and not foreign to the family of the founder. That they might\r\nbe constant attendants in the temple, he appointed them salaries out of\r\nthe public treasury; and by enjoining virginity, and other religious\r\nobservances, he made them sacred and venerable. He selected twelve Salii\r\nfor Mars Gradivus, and gave them the distinction of an embroidered\r\ntunic, and over the tunic a brazen covering for the breast. He commanded\r\nthem to carry the celestial shields called [26]Ancilia, and to go\r\nthrough the city singing songs, with leaping and solemn dancing. Then he\r\nchose out of the number of the fathers Numa Marcius, son of Marcus, as\r\npontiff,[27] and consigned to him an entire system of religious rites\r\nwritten out and sealed, (showing) with what victims, upon what days, and\r\nin what temples the sacred rites were to be performed; and from what\r\nfunds the money was to be taken for these expenses. He placed all\r\nreligious institutions, public and private, under the cognisance of the\r\npontiff to the end that there might be some place where the people\r\nshould come to consult, lest any confusion in the divine worship might\r\nbe occasioned by neglecting the ceremonies of their own country, and\r\nintroducing foreign ones. (He ordained) that the same pontiff should\r\ninstruct the people not only in the celestial ceremonies, but also in\r\n(the manner of performing) funeral solemnities, and of appeasing the\r\nmanes of the dead; and what prodigies sent by lightning or any other\r\nphenomenon were to be attended to and expiated. To elicit such\r\nknowledge from the divine mind, he dedicated an altar on the Aventine to\r\nJupiter [28]Elicius, and consulted the god by auguries as to what\r\n(prodigies) should be expiated.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: _Ancilia_, from ???????.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: _Pontificem_, scil. Maximum.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28:\r\n\r\n    _Eliciunt cœlo te, Jupiter: unde minores\r\n        Nunc quoque te celebrant, Eliciumque vocant_.\r\n\r\nOv. F. iii. 327.]\r\n\r\n21. The whole multitude having been diverted from violence and arms to\r\nthe considering and adjusting these matters, both their minds had been\r\nengaged in doing something, and the constant watchfulness of the gods\r\nnow impressed upon them, as the deity of heaven seemed to interest\r\nitself in human concerns, had filled the breasts of all with such piety,\r\nthat faith and religious obligations governed the state, no less than\r\nfear of the laws and of punishment. And while[29] the people were\r\nmoulding themselves after the morals of the king, as their best example,\r\nthe neighbouring states also, who had formerly thought that it was a\r\ncamp, not a city, situate in the midst of them to disturb the general\r\npeace, were brought (to feel) such respect for them that they considered\r\nit impious that a state, wholly occupied in the worship of the gods,\r\nshould be molested. There was a grove, the middle of which was irrigated\r\nby a spring of running water, issuing from a dark grotto. As Numa went\r\noften thither alone, under pretence of conferring with the goddess, he\r\ndedicated the place to the Muses, because their meetings with his wife\r\nEgeria were held there. He also instituted a yearly festival to Faith\r\nalone, and commanded the priests to be carried to her temple in an\r\narched chariot drawn by two horses, and to perform the divine service\r\nwith their hands wrapt up to the fingers, intimating that Faith ought to\r\nbe protected, and that her seat ought to be sacred even in men's right\r\nhands. He instituted many other sacred rites, and dedicated places for\r\nperforming them, which the priests call Argei. But the greatest of all\r\nhis works was his maintenance of peace, during the whole period of his\r\nreign, no less than of his royal prerogative. Thus two kings in\r\nsuccession, by different methods, the one by war, the other by peace,\r\naggrandized the state. Romulus reigned thirty-seven years, Numa\r\nforty-three: the state was both strong and well versed in the arts of\r\nwar and peace.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: _Cum ipsi se ---- formarent, tum finitimi etiam_, etc.\r\nSome of the editors of Livy have remarked on this passage, that _cum_\r\nwhen answering to _tum_ may be joined to a subjunctive, as here; the\r\nfact however is, that _cum_ here does not answer to _tum_ at all; _cum_\r\nis here \"whilst,\"--and so necessarily requires the verb to be in the\r\nsubjunctive mood.]\r\n\r\n22. Upon the death of Numa, the administration returned again to an\r\ninterregnum. After that the people appointed as king, Tullus Hostilius,\r\nthe grandson of that Hostilius who had made the noble stand against the\r\nSabines at the foot of the citadel. The fathers confirmed the choice. He\r\nwas not only unlike the preceding king, but was even of a more warlike\r\ndisposition than Romulus. Both his youth and strength, and the renown of\r\nhis grandfather, stimulated his ambition. Thinking therefore that the\r\nstate was becoming languid through quiet, he every where sought for\r\npretexts for stirring up war. It happened that some Roman and Alban\r\npeasants had mutually plundered each other's lands. C. Cluilius at that\r\ntime governed Alba. From both sides ambassadors were sent almost at the\r\nsame time, to demand restitution. Tullus ordered his to attend to\r\nnothing before their instructions. He knew well that the Alban would\r\nrefuse, and that so war might be proclaimed on just grounds. Their\r\ncommission was executed more remissly by the Albans. For being\r\ncourteously and kindly entertained by Tullus, they politely avail\r\nthemselves of the king's hospitality. Meanwhile the Romans had both been\r\nfirst in demanding restitution, and, upon the refusal of the Albans, had\r\nproclaimed war after an interval of thirty days: of this they give\r\nTullus notice. Upon this he granted the Alban ambassadors an opportunity\r\nof stating what they came to demand. They, ignorant of all, waste some\r\ntime in making apologies: \"That it was with the utmost reluctance they\r\nshould say any thing which was not pleasing to Tullus; but they were\r\ncompelled by their orders. That they had come to demand restitution; and\r\nif this be not made, they were commanded to declare war.\" To this Tullus\r\nmade answer, \"Go tell your king, that the king of the Romans takes the\r\ngods to witness, which of the two nations hath with contempt first\r\ndismissed the ambassadors demanding restitution, that on it they may\r\nvisit all the calamities of this war.\" The Albans carry home these\r\ntidings.\r\n\r\n23. War was prepared for on both sides with the utmost vigour, very like\r\nto a civil war, in a manner between parents and children: both being\r\nTrojan offspring; for from Troy came Lavinium, from Lavinium Alba, and\r\nthe Romans were descended from the race of Alban kings. But the result\r\nof the war rendered the quarrel less distressing, for they never came to\r\nany action; and, when the houses only of one of the cities had been\r\ndemolished, the two states were incorporated into one. The Albans first\r\nmade an irruption into the Roman territories with a large army. They\r\npitch their camp not above five miles from the city, and surround it\r\nwith a trench, which, for several ages, was called the Cluilian trench,\r\nfrom the name of the general, till, in process of time, the name,\r\ntogether with the thing itself, were both forgotten. In that camp\r\nCluilius, the Alban king, dies; the Albans create Mettus[30] Fuffetius\r\ndictator. In the mean time, Tullus being in high spirits, especially on\r\nthe death of the king, and giving out that the supreme power of the\r\ngods, having begun at the head, would take vengeance on the whole Alban\r\nnation for this impious war, having passed the enemy's camp in the\r\nnight-time, marches with a hostile army into the Alban territory. This\r\ncircumstance drew out Mettus from his camp likewise; he leads his forces\r\nas near as he can to the enemy; from thence he commands a herald,\r\ndespatched by him, to tell Tullus that a conference was expedient before\r\nthey came to an engagement; and that if he would give him a meeting, he\r\nwas certain he should adduce matters which concerned the interest of\r\nRome not less than that of Alba. Tullus not slighting the proposal,\r\nthough the advances made were of little avail, draws out his men in\r\norder of battle; the Albans on their part come out also. As both armies\r\nstood in battle-array, the chiefs, with a few of the principal officers,\r\nadvance into the middle between them. Then the Alban commences thus:\r\n[31]\"That injuries and the non-restitution of property according to\r\ntreaty, when demanded, were the cause of this war, methinks I both heard\r\nour King Cluilius (assert), and I doubt not, Tullus, but that you state\r\nthe same thing. But if the truth is to be told, rather than that which\r\nis plausible, the desire of dominion stimulates two kindred and\r\nneighbouring states to arms. Nor do I take upon myself to determine\r\nwhether rightly or wrongly: be that his consideration who commenced the\r\nwar. The Albans have made me their leader for carrying on the war. Of\r\nthis, Tullus, I would wish to warn you; how powerful the Etruscan state\r\nis around us, and round you particularly, you know better (than we),\r\ninasmuch as you are nearer them. They are very powerful by land,\r\nextremely so by sea. Recollect that, when you shall give the signal for\r\nbattle, these two armies will presently be a spectacle to them; and they\r\nmay fall on us wearied and exhausted, victor and vanquished together.\r\nTherefore, in the name of heaven, since, not content with certain\r\nliberty, we are incurring the dubious risk of sovereignty and slavery,\r\nlet us adopt some method, whereby, without much loss, without much blood\r\nof either nation, it may be decided which shall rule the other.\"--The\r\nproposal is not displeasing to Tullus, though both from the natural bent\r\nof his mind, as also from the hope of victory, he was rather inclined to\r\nviolence. After some consideration, a plan is adopted on both sides, for\r\nwhich Fortune herself afforded the materials.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: _Mettus_. Gronovius and Bekker read _Mettius_; Niebuhr\r\nalso prefers _Mettius_; he conceives that the Latin _prænomina_ and the\r\nRoman _nomina_ terminated in _ius_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: _Injurias et non redditas_, etc. The construction is, _et\r\nego videor audisse regem nostrum Cluilium (præ se ferre) injurias et non\r\nredditas res ... nec dubito te ferre eadem præ te, Tulle_.]\r\n\r\n24. It happened that there were in each of the two armies three\r\nbrothers[32] born at one birth, unequal neither in age nor strength.\r\nThat they were called Horatii and Curiatii is certain enough; nor is\r\nthere any circumstance of antiquity more celebrated; yet in a matter so\r\nwell ascertained, a doubt remains concerning their names, to which\r\nnation the Horatii and to which the Curiatii belonged. Authors claim\r\nthem for both sides; yet I find more who call the Horatii Romans. My\r\ninclination leads me to follow them. The kings confer with the three\r\nbrothers, that they should fight with their swords each in defence of\r\ntheir respective country; (assuring them) that dominion would be on that\r\nside on which victory should be. No objection is made; time and place\r\nare agreed on. Before they engaged, a compact is entered into between\r\nthe Romans and Albans on these conditions, that the state whose\r\nchampions should come off victorious in that combat, should rule the\r\nother state without further dispute. Different treaties are made on\r\ndifferent terms, but they are all concluded in the same general method.\r\nWe have heard that it was then concluded as follows, nor is there a more\r\nancient record of any treaty. A herald asked king Tullus thus, \"Do you\r\ncommand me, O king, to conclude a treaty with the pater patratus of the\r\nAlban people?\" After the king had given command, he said, \"I demand\r\nvervain of thee, O king.\" To which the king replied, \"Take some that is\r\npure.\" The herald brought a pure blade of grass from the citadel; again\r\nhe asked the king thus, \"Dost thou, O king, appoint me the royal\r\ndelegate of the Roman people, the Quirites? _including_ my vessels and\r\nattendants?\" The king answered, \"That which may be done without\r\ndetriment to me and to the Roman people, the Quirites, I do.\" The herald\r\nwas M. Valerius, who appointed Sp. Fusius pater patratus, touching his\r\nhead and hair with the vervain. The pater patratus is appointed \"ad\r\njusjurandum patrandum,\" that is, to ratify the treaty; and he goes\r\nthrough it in a great many words, which, being expressed in a long set\r\nform, it is not worth while repeating. After setting forth the\r\nconditions, he says, \"Hear, O Jupiter; hear, O pater patratus of the\r\nAlban people, and ye, Alban people, hear. As those (conditions), from\r\nfirst to last, have been recited openly from those tablets or wax\r\nwithout wicked fraud, and as they have been most correctly understood\r\nhere this day, from those conditions the Roman people will not be the\r\nfirst to swerve. If they first swerve by public concert, by wicked\r\nfraud, on that day do thou, O Jupiter, so strike the Roman people, as I\r\nshall here this day strike this swine; and do thou strike them so much\r\nthe more, as thou art more able and more powerful.\" When he said this,\r\nhe struck the swine with a flint stone. The Albans likewise went through\r\ntheir own form and oath by their own dictator and priests.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: _Three brothers born at one birth_. Dionys. iii. 14,\r\ndescribes them as cousin-germans. Vid. Wachsmuth, p. 147. Niebuhr, i. p.\r\n342.]\r\n\r\n25. The treaty being concluded, the twin-brothers, as had been agreed,\r\ntake arms. Whilst their respective friends exhortingly reminded each\r\nparty \"that their country's gods, their country and parents, all their\r\ncountrymen both at home and in the army, had their eyes then fixed on\r\ntheir arms, on their hands; naturally brave, and animated by the\r\nexhortations of their friends, they advance into the midst between the\r\ntwo lines.\" The two armies sat down before their respective camps, free\r\nrather from present danger than from anxiety: for the sovereign power\r\nwas at stake, depending on the valour and fortune of so few.\r\nAccordingly, therefore, eager and anxious, they have their attention\r\nintensely riveted on a spectacle far from pleasing. The signal is given:\r\nand the three youths on each side, as if in battle-array, rush to the\r\ncharge with determined fury, bearing in their breasts the spirits of\r\nmighty armies: nor do the one or the other regard their personal danger;\r\nthe public dominion or slavery is present to their mind, and the\r\nfortune[33] of their country, which was ever after destined to be such\r\nas they should now establish it. As soon as their arms clashed on the\r\nfirst encounter, and their burnished swords glittered, great horror\r\nstrikes the spectators; and, hope inclining to neither side, their voice\r\nand breath were suspended. Then having engaged hand to hand, when not\r\nonly the movements of their bodies, and the rapid brandishings of their\r\narms and weapons, but wounds also and blood were seen, two of the Romans\r\nfell lifeless, one upon the other, the three Albans being wounded. And\r\nwhen the Alban army raised a shout of joy at their fall, hope entirely,\r\nanxiety however not yet, deserted the Roman legions, alarmed for the lot\r\nof the one, whom the three Curiatii surrounded. He happened to be\r\nunhurt, so that, though alone he was by no means a match for them all\r\ntogether, yet he was confident against each singly. In order therefore\r\nto separate their attack, he takes to flight, presuming that they would\r\npursue him with such swiftness as the wounded state of his body would\r\nsuffer each. He had now fled a considerable distance from the place\r\nwhere they had fought, when, looking behind, he perceives them pursuing\r\nhim at great intervals from each other; and that one of them was not far\r\nfrom him. On him he turned round with great fury. And whilst the Alban\r\narmy shouts out to the Curiatii to succour their brother, Horatius,\r\nvictorious in having slain his antagonist, was now proceeding to a\r\nsecond attack. Then the Romans encourage their champion with a shout\r\nsuch as is usually (given) by persons cheering in consequence of\r\nunexpected success: he also hastens to put an end to the combat.\r\nWherefore before the other, who was not far off, could come up he\r\ndespatches the second Curiatius also. And now, the combat being brought\r\nto an equality of numbers, one on each side remained, but they were\r\nequal neither in hope nor in strength. The one his body untouched by a\r\nweapon, and a double victory made courageous for a third contest: the\r\nother dragging along his body exhausted from the wound, exhausted from\r\nrunning, and dispirited by the slaughter of his brethren before his\r\neyes, presents himself to his victorious antagonist. Nor was that a\r\nfight. The Roman, exulting, says, \"Two I have offered to the shades of\r\nmy brothers: the third I will offer to the cause of this war, that the\r\nRoman may rule over the Alban.\" He thrusts his sword down into his\r\nthroat, whilst faintly sustaining the weight of his armour: he strips\r\nhim as he lies prostrate. The Romans receive Horatius with triumph and\r\ncongratulation; with so much the greater joy, as success had followed so\r\nclose on fear. They then turn to the burial of their friends with\r\ndispositions by no means alike; for the one side was elated with (the\r\nacquisition of) empire, the other subjected to foreign jurisdiction:\r\ntheir sepulchres are still extant in the place where each fell; the two\r\nRoman ones in one place nearer to Alba, the three Alban ones towards\r\nRome; but distant in situation from each other, and just as they\r\nfought.[34]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: The order is: _fortuna patriæ deinde futura ea quam ipsi\r\nf. (animo obvers.)_; the fortune of their country, the high or humble\r\ncharacter of which for the future depended on their exertions on that\r\noccasion.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: The two Roman champions, we have seen, fell in the one\r\nplace, _super alium alius_; consequently were buried together; whilst\r\nthe Curiatii fell in different places, as Horatius contrived to separate\r\nthem to avoid their joint attack.]\r\n\r\n26. Before they parted from thence, when Mettus, in conformity to the\r\ntreaty which had been concluded, asked what orders he had to give,\r\nTullus orders him to keep the youth in arms, that he designed to employ\r\nthem, if a war should break out with the Veientes. After this both\r\narmies returned to their homes. Horatius marched foremost, carrying\r\nbefore him the spoils of the three brothers: his sister, a maiden who\r\nhad been betrothed to one of the Curiatii, met him before the gate\r\nCapena: and having recognized her lover's military robe, which she\r\nherself had wrought, on her brother's shoulders, she tore her hair, and\r\nwith bitter wailings called by name on her deceased lover. The sister's\r\nlamentations in the midst of his own victory, and of such great public\r\nrejoicings, raised the indignation of the excited youth. Having\r\ntherefore drawn his sword, he run the damsel through the body, at the\r\nsame time chiding her in these words: \"Go hence, with thy unseasonable\r\nlove to thy spouse, forgetful of thy dead brothers, and of him who\r\nsurvives, forgetful of thy native country. So perish every Roman woman\r\nwho shall mourn an enemy.\" This action seemed shocking to the fathers\r\nand to the people; but his recent services outweighed its guilt.\r\nNevertheless he was carried before the king for judgment. The king, that\r\nhe himself might not be the author of a decision so melancholy, and so\r\ndisagreeable to the people, or of the punishment consequent on that\r\ndecision, having summoned an assembly of the people, says, \"I appoint,\r\naccording to law, duumvirs to pass sentence on Horatius for\r\n[35]treason.\" The law was of dreadful import. [36]\"Let the duumvirs pass\r\nsentence for treason. If he appeal from the duumvirs, let him contend by\r\nappeal; if they shall gain the cause,[37] cover his head; hang him by a\r\nrope from a gallows; scourge him either within the pomœrium or\r\nwithout the pomœrium.\" When the duumvirs appointed by this law, who\r\ndid not consider that, according to the law, they could [38]acquit even\r\nan innocent person, had found him guilty; one of them says, \"P.\r\nHoratius, I judge thee guilty of treason. Go, lictor, bind his hands.\"\r\nThe lictor had approached him, and was fixing the rope. Then Horatius,\r\nby the advice of Tullus,[39] a favourable interpreter of the law, says,\r\n\"I appeal.\" Accordingly the matter was contested by appeal to the\r\npeople. On that trial persons were much affected, especially by P.\r\nHoratius the father declaring, that he considered his daughter\r\ndeservedly slain; were it not so, that he would by his authority as a\r\nfather have inflicted punishment on his son.[40] He then entreated that\r\nthey would not render childless him whom but a little while ago they had\r\nbeheld with a fine progeny. During these words the old man, having\r\nembraced the youth, pointing to the spoils of the Curiatii fixed up in\r\nthat place which is now called Pila Horatia, \"Romans,\" said he, \"can you\r\nbear to see bound beneath a gallows amidst scourges and tortures, him\r\nwhom you just now beheld marching decorated (with spoils) and exulting\r\nin victory; a sight so shocking as the eyes even of the Albans could\r\nscarcely endure. Go, lictor, bind those hands, which but a little while\r\nsince, being armed, established sovereignty for the Roman people. Go,\r\ncover the head of the liberator of this city; hang him on the gallows;\r\nscourge him, either within the pomœrium, so it be only amid those\r\njavelins and spoils of the enemy; or without the pomœrium, only amid\r\nthe graves of the Curiatii. For whither can you bring this youth, where\r\nhis own glories must not redeem him from such ignominy of punishment?\"\r\nThe people could not withstand the tears of the father, or the\r\nresolution of the son, so undaunted in every danger; and acquitted him\r\nmore through admiration of his bravery, than for the justice of his\r\ncause. But that so notorious a murder might be atoned for by some\r\nexpiation, the father was commanded to make satisfaction for the son at\r\nthe public charge. He, having offered certain expiatory sacrifices,\r\nwhich were ever after continued in the Horatian family, and laid a beam\r\nacross the street, made his son pass under it as under a yoke, with his\r\nhead covered. This remains even to this day, being constantly repaired\r\nat the expense of the public; they call it Sororium Tigillum. A tomb of\r\nsquare stone was erected to Horatia in the place where she was stabbed\r\nand fell.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: _Perduellio_, (duellum, bellum,) high treason against the\r\nstate or its sovereign; but in those times any offence deserving capital\r\npunishment was included under that of treason, _Qui Horatio\r\nperduellionem judicent_, to pass sentence on Horatius, as being\r\nmanifestly guilty of murder; not to try whether he was guilty or not.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: Duumviri, etc. Niebuhr considers these to be the very\r\nwords of the old formula.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: If the sentence (of the duumviri) be confirmed by the\r\npeople.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: The letter of the law allowed of no justification or\r\nextenuation of the fact. It left no alternative to the judge.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: He kindly pointed out the loop-hole in the law, which left\r\nan opening for the culprit's acquittal.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: By the laws of Romulus, a father had the power of life and\r\ndeath over his children.]\r\n\r\n27. Nor did the peace with Alba continue long. The dissatisfaction of\r\nthe populace, because the fortune of the state had been hazarded on\r\nthree soldiers, perverted the weak mind of the dictator; and because\r\nhonourable measures had not turned out well, he began to conciliate\r\ntheir affections by perfidious means. Accordingly, as one formerly\r\nseeking peace in war, so now seeking war in peace, because he perceived\r\nthat his own state possessed more courage than strength, he stirs up\r\nother nations to make war openly and by proclamation:[41] for his own\r\npeople he reserves treachery under the mask of alliance. The Fidenates,\r\na Roman colony, having gained over the Veientes as partisans in the\r\nconfederacy, are instigated to declare war and take up arms under a\r\ncompact of desertion on the part of the Albans. When Fidenæ had openly\r\n[42]revolted, Tullus, after summoning Mettus and his army from Alba,\r\nmarches against the enemy. When he crossed the Anio, he pitches his camp\r\nat the [43]conflux of the rivers. Between that place and Fidenæ, the\r\narmy of the Veientes had crossed the Tiber. These, in line of battle,\r\noccupied the right wing near the river; the Fidenates are posted on the\r\nleft nearer the mountains. Tullus stations his own men opposite the\r\nVeientian foe; the Albans he opposes to the legion of the Fidenates. The\r\nAlban had not more courage than fidelity. Neither daring therefore to\r\nkeep his ground, nor to desert openly, he files off slowly to the\r\nmountains. After this, when he supposed he had gone far enough, he\r\n[44]halts his entire army; and being still irresolute in mind, in order\r\nto waste time, he opens his ranks. His design was, to turn his forces to\r\nthat side to which fortune should give success. At first the Romans who\r\nstood nearest were astonished, when they perceived their flanks were\r\nuncovered by the departure of their allies; then a horseman in full\r\ngallop announces to the king that the Albans were moving off. Tullus, in\r\nthis perilous juncture, vowed twelve Salii, and temples to Paleness and\r\nPanic. Rebuking the horseman in a loud voice, so that the enemy might\r\nhear him, he orders him to return to the fight, \"that there was no\r\noccasion for alarm; that by his order the Alban army was marching round\r\nto fall on the unprotected rear of the Fidenates.\" He likewise commands\r\nhim to order the cavalry to raise their spears aloft; this expedient\r\nintercepted from a great part of the Roman infantry the view of the\r\nAlban army retreating. Those who saw it, believing what they had heard\r\nthe king say, fought with the greater ardour. The alarm is now\r\ntransferred to the enemy; they had both heard what had been pronounced\r\nso audibly, and a great part of the Fidenates, as having been joined as\r\ncolonists to the Romans, understood Latin. Therefore, that they might\r\nnot be intercepted from the town by a sudden descent of the Albans from\r\nthe hills, they take to flight. Tullus presses forward, and having\r\nrouted the wing of the Fidenates, returned with greater fury against the\r\nVeientes, disheartened by the panic of the others: nor did they sustain\r\nhis charge; but the river, opposed to them behind, prevented a\r\nprecipitate flight. Whither when their flight led, some, shamefully\r\nthrowing down their arms, rushed blindly into the river; others, while\r\nthey linger on the banks, doubting whether to fly or fight, were\r\noverpowered. Never before had the Romans a more desperate battle.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: The part which he reserves for himself and the Albans is\r\nto play the traitors to Tullus in the hour of need, wearing meanwhile\r\nthe mark of friendship to Rome.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: The fact is, that the subject population rose up against\r\nthe Roman colonists, drove them out of the town, and asserted their\r\nindependence. Nieb. i. 24. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: The Tiber and the Anio.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: _Erigit_--\"he makes it halt,\" from the French _faire\r\nalte_, or formerly _haut_, because soldiers then stand upright and hold\r\ntheir spears erect.]\r\n\r\n28. Then the Alban army, that had been spectators of the fight, was\r\nmarched down into the plains. Mettus congratulates Tullus on his defeat\r\nof the enemy; Tullus on his part addresses Mettus with great civility.\r\nHe orders the Albans to unite their camp with the Romans, which he\r\nprayed might prove beneficial to both; and prepares a sacrifice of\r\npurification for the next day. As soon as it was light, all things being\r\nin readiness, according to custom, he commands both armies to be\r\nsummoned to an assembly. The heralds,[45] beginning at the outside,\r\nsummoned the Albans first. They, struck[46] too with the novelty of the\r\nthing, in order to hear the Roman king harangue, crowded next to him.\r\nThe Roman legions, under arms, by concert surrounded them; a charge had\r\nbeen given to the centurions to execute their orders without delay. Then\r\nTullus begins as follows: \"Romans, if ever before at any other time in\r\nany war there was (an occasion) on which you should return thanks, first\r\nto the immortal gods, next to your own valour, that occasion was\r\nyesterday's battle. For the contest was not more with enemies than with\r\nthe treachery and perfidy of allies, a contest which is more serious and\r\nmore dangerous. For that a false opinion may not influence you, the\r\nAlbans retired to the mountains without my orders, nor was that my\r\ncommand, but a stratagem and the pretence of a command: that so your\r\nattention might not be drawn away from the fight, you being kept in\r\nignorance that you were deserted, and that terror and dismay might be\r\nstruck into the enemy, conceiving themselves to be surrounded on the\r\nrear. Nor does that guilt, which I now state, extend to all the Albans.\r\nThey followed their leader; as you too would have done, if I had wished\r\nmy army to make a move to any other point from thence. Mettus there is\r\nthe leader of that march, the same Mettus is the contriver of this war;\r\nMettus is the violator of the treaty between Rome and Alba. Let another\r\nhereafter attempt the like conduct, unless I now make of him a signal\r\nexample to mankind.\" The centurions in arms stand round Mettus, and the\r\nking proceeds with the rest as he had commenced: \"It is my intention,\r\nand may it prove fortunate, auspicious, and happy to the Roman people,\r\nto myself, and to you, O Albans, to transplant all the inhabitants of\r\nAlba to Rome: to grant your people the rights of citizenship, and to\r\nadmit your nobles into the rank of senators: to make one city, one\r\nrepublic; that as the Alban state was formerly divided from one people\r\ninto two, so it may now return into one.\" On hearing this the Alban\r\nyouth, unarmed, surrounded by armed men, however divided in their\r\nsentiments, yet restrained by the common apprehension, continue silent.\r\nThen Tullus proceeded: \"If, Mettus Fuffetius, you were capable of\r\nlearning fidelity, and how to observe treaties, that lesson would have\r\nbeen taught you by me, while still alive. Now, since your disposition is\r\nincurable, do you at least by your punishment teach mankind to consider\r\nthose things sacred which have been violated by you. As therefore a\r\nlittle while since you kept your mind divided between the interest of\r\nFidenæ and of Rome, so shall you now surrender your body to be torn\r\nasunder in different directions.\" Upon this, two chariots drawn by four\r\nhorses being brought, he ties Mettus extended at full length to their\r\ncarriages: then the horses were driven on in different directions,\r\ncarrying off the mangled body on each carriage, where the limbs had been\r\nfastened by the cords. All turned away their eyes from so shocking a\r\nspectacle. That was the first and last instance of a punishment among\r\nthe Romans regardless of the laws of humanity. In other cases we may\r\nboast that no nation whatever adopted milder forms of punishment.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: _Præcones ab extremo_. At the farther part of the Roman\r\ncamp, where it joined that of the Albans.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: As well as by the orders issued by Tullus.]\r\n\r\n29. During these occurrences the cavalry had been despatched onward to\r\nAlba to remove the multitude to Rome. The legions were next led thither\r\nto demolish the city. When they entered the gates, there was not indeed\r\nthat tumult nor panic, such as usually takes place with captured cities\r\nwhen the gates being burst open, or the walls levelled by the ram, or\r\nthe citadel taken by assault, the shouts of the enemy and rush of armed\r\nmen through the city throws every thing into confusion by fire and\r\nsword: but gloomy silence and speechless sorrow so absorbed the minds of\r\nall, that, through fear, forgetting what they should leave behind, what\r\nthey should take with them, all concert failing them, and frequently\r\nmaking inquiries of each other, they now stood at their thresholds, now\r\nwandering about they strayed through their houses, doomed to see them\r\nfor that the last time. But as soon as the shouts of the horsemen\r\ncommanding them to depart now urged them on, the crashing of the\r\ndwellings which were being demolished, was now heard in the remotest\r\nparts of the city, and the dust, rising in distant places, had filled\r\nevery quarter as with a cloud spread over them; hastily snatching up\r\nwhatever each of them could, whilst they went forth leaving behind them\r\ntheir guardian deity and household gods, and the homes in which each had\r\nbeen born and brought up, a continued train of emigrants soon filled the\r\nways, and the sight of others through mutual commiseration renewed their\r\ntears, and piteous cries too were heard, of the women more especially,\r\nwhen they passed by their revered temples now beset with armed men, and\r\nleft their gods as it were in captivity. After the Albans had evacuated\r\nthe town, the Roman soldiery level all the public and private edifices\r\nindiscriminately to the ground, and one short hour consigned to\r\ndemolition and ruin the work of four hundred years, during which Alba\r\nhad stood. The temples of the gods, however, for such had been the\r\norders given by the king, were spared.\r\n\r\n30. In the mean time Rome increases by the demolition of Alba. The\r\nnumber of citizens is doubled. The Cœlian mount is added to the city,\r\nand in order that it might be inhabited more populously, Tullus selects\r\nthat situation for his palace and there took up his abode. The leading\r\npersons among the Albans he enrols among the patricians, that that\r\nbranch of the state also might increase, the Julii, Servilii, Quinctii,\r\nGeganii, Curiatii, Clœlii; and as a consecrated place of meeting for\r\nthe order augmented by him he built a senate-house, which was called\r\nHostilia even down to the age of our fathers. And that every rank might\r\nacquire some additional strength from the new people, he formed ten\r\ntroops of horsemen from among the Albans: he likewise recruited the old,\r\nand raised new legions from the same source. Confiding in this increase\r\nof strength, Tullus declares war against the Sabines, a nation at that\r\ntime the most powerful, next to the Etrurians, in men and in arms.\r\nInjuries had been done on both sides, and restitution demanded in vain.\r\nTullus complained that some Roman merchants had been seized in an open\r\nmarket near the temple of Feronia; the Sabines, that some of their\r\npeople had taken refuge in the asylum, and were detained at Rome. These\r\nwere assigned as the causes of the war. The Sabines, holding in\r\nrecollection both that a portion of their strength had been fixed at\r\nRome by Tatius, and that the Roman power had also been lately increased\r\nby the accession of the Alban people, began, on their part, to look\r\naround for foreign aid. Etruria was in their neighbourhood; of the\r\nEtrurians the Veientes were the nearest. From thence they drew some\r\nvolunteers, their minds being stirred up to a revolt, chiefly in\r\nconsequence of the rankling animosities from (former) wars. And pay also\r\nhad its weight with some stragglers belonging to the indigent\r\npopulation. They were assisted by no aid from the government, and the\r\nfaith of the truce stipulated with Romulus was strictly observed by the\r\nVeientes (for with respect to the others it is less surprising). While\r\nthey were preparing for war with the utmost vigour, and the matter\r\nseemed to turn on this, which should first commence hostilities, Tullus\r\nfirst passes into the Sabine territory. A desperate battle ensued at the\r\nwood called Malitiosa,[47] in which the Roman army was far superior,\r\nboth by the strength of their foot, and also by the recent augmentation\r\nof their cavalry. The Sabine ranks were thrown into disorder by a sudden\r\ncharge of the cavalry, nor could either the fight be afterwards\r\nrestored, or a retreat accomplished without great slaughter.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: _Malitiosam_. ??? ???? ?a???µ???? ?a???????. Dio. iii.]\r\n\r\n31. After the defeat of the Sabines, when the government of Tullus and\r\nthe whole Roman state was in high renown, and in a very flourishing\r\ncondition, word was brought to the king and senators, that it rained\r\nstones on the Alban Mount. As this could scarcely be credited, on\r\npersons being sent to inquire into the prodigy, a thick shower of stones\r\nfell from heaven in their sight, just as when hail collected into balls\r\nis pelted down to the earth by the winds. Besides, they imagined that\r\nthey heard a loud voice from the grove on the summit of the hill,\r\nrequiring the Albans to perform their religious service according to the\r\nrites of their native country, which they had consigned to oblivion, as\r\nif their gods had been abandoned together with their country; and they\r\nhad either adopted the religion of Rome, or, as may happen, enraged at\r\ntheir evil destiny, had renounced altogether the worship of the gods. A\r\nfestival of nine days was instituted publicly by the Romans also on\r\naccount of the same prodigy, either in obedience to the heavenly voice\r\nsent from the Alban mount, (for that too is stated,) or by the advice of\r\nthe aruspices. Certain it is, it continued a solemn observance, that\r\nwhenever the same prodigy was announced, a festival for nine days was\r\nobserved. Not long after, they were afflicted with a pestilence; and\r\nthough from this there arose an aversion to military service, yet no\r\nrespite from arms was granted by this warlike king, who considered that\r\nthe bodies of the young men were even more healthy abroad than at home,\r\nuntil he himself also was seized with a lingering disease. Then,\r\ntogether with his body, those fierce spirits became so broken, that he,\r\nwho formerly considered nothing less worthy of a king than to devote his\r\nmind to religion, suddenly became a slave to every form of superstition,\r\nimportant and trifling, and filled the people's minds also with\r\nreligious scruples. The generality of persons, now wishing to recur to\r\nthat state of things which had existed under king Numa, thought that the\r\nonly relief left for their sickly bodies was, if peace and pardon could\r\nbe obtained from the gods. They say that the king himself, turning over\r\nthe commentaries of Numa, after he had found therein that certain\r\nsacrifices of a secret and solemn nature had been performed to Jupiter\r\nElicius, shut himself up and set about the performance of this\r\nsolemnity; but that that rite was not duly undertaken or conducted, and\r\nthat not only no appearance of heavenly notification was presented to\r\nhim, but that he was struck with lightning and burnt to ashes, together\r\nwith his house, through the anger of Jupiter, exasperated at the\r\nimpropriety of the ceremony. Tullus reigned two-and-thirty years with\r\ngreat military renown.\r\n\r\n32. On the death of Tullus the government devolved once more upon the\r\nsenate, and they nominated an interrex; and on his holding the comitia,\r\nthe people elected Ancus Marcius king. The fathers confirmed the\r\nelection. Ancus Marcius was the grandson of king Numa Pompilius by his\r\ndaughter. As soon as he ascended the throne, reflecting on the renown of\r\nhis grandfather, and that the late reign, glorious in every other\r\nrespect, in one particular had not been sufficiently prosperous, the\r\nrites of religion having either been utterly neglected, or improperly\r\nperformed; deeming it of the highest importance to perform the public\r\nceremonies of religion as they had been instituted by Numa, he orders\r\nthe pontiff, after he had transcribed them all from the king's\r\ncommentaries on white tables, to expose them to public view. Hence, both\r\nhis own subjects, desirous of peace, and the neighbouring nations,\r\nentertained a hope that the king would conform to the conduct and\r\ninstitutions of his grandfather. Accordingly the Latins, with whom a\r\ntreaty had been concluded in the reign of Tullus, assumed new courage;\r\nand after they had made an incursion upon the Roman lands, return a\r\ncontemptuous answer to the Romans on their demanding restitution,\r\nsupposing that the Roman king would spend his reign in indolence among\r\nchapels and altars. The genius of Ancus was of a middle kind, partaking\r\nboth of that of Numa and of Romulus; and, besides that, he thought that\r\npeace was more necessary in his grandfather's reign, considering the\r\npeople were but recent as well as uncivilized, he also (considered) that\r\nhe could not, without injury, preserve the tranquillity which had fallen\r\nto his lot; that his patience was tried, and being tried, was now\r\ndespised; and that the times were more suited to a king Tullus than to a\r\nNuma. In order, however, that as Numa had instituted religious rites in\r\npeace, ceremonies relating to war might be transmitted by him, and that\r\nwars might not only be waged, but proclaimed also according to some\r\nrite, he borrowed from an ancient nation, the Æquicolae, the form which\r\nthe heralds still preserve, according to which restitution is demanded.\r\nThe ambassador, when he comes to the frontiers of the people from whom\r\nsatisfaction is demanded, having his head covered with a fillet, (the\r\nfillet is of wool,) says, \"Hear, O Jupiter, hear, ye confines, (naming\r\nthe nation they belong to,) let Justice hear. I am a public messenger of\r\nthe Roman people; I come justly and religiously deputed, and let my\r\nwords gain credit.\" He then makes his demands; afterwards he makes a\r\nsolemn appeal to Jupiter, \"If I unjustly or impiously demand those\r\npersons and those goods to be given up to me, the messenger of the Roman\r\npeople, then never permit me to enjoy my native country.\" These words he\r\nrepeats when he passes over the frontiers; the same to the first man he\r\nmeets; the same on entering the gate; the same on entering the forum,\r\nsome few words in the form of the declaration and oath being changed. If\r\nthe persons whom he demands are not delivered up, on the expiration of\r\nthirty-three days, for so many are enjoined by the rule, he declares\r\nwar, thus: \"Hear, Jupiter, and thou, Juno, Romulus, and all ye\r\ncelestial, terrestrial, and infernal gods, give ear! I call you to\r\nwitness, that this nation (naming it) is unjust, and does not act with\r\nequity; but we will consult the fathers in our own country concerning\r\nthese matters, and by what means we may obtain our right.\" After that\r\nthe messenger returns to Rome to consult: the king immediately used to\r\nconsult the fathers almost in the following words: \"Concerning such\r\nmatters, differences, and quarrels, as the pater patratus of the Roman\r\npeople, the Quirites, has conferred with the pater patratus of the\r\nancient Latins, and with the ancient Latin people, which matters ought\r\nto be given up, performed, discharged, which matters they have neither\r\ngiven up, performed, nor discharged, declare,\" says he to him, whose\r\nopinion he first asked, \"what think you?\" Then he said, \"I think that\r\nthey should be demanded by a just and regularly declared war, therefore\r\nI consent, and vote for it.\" Then the others were asked in order, and\r\nwhen the majority of those present agreed in the same opinion, the war\r\nwas resolved on. It was customary for the fecialis to carry in his hand\r\na javelin pointed with steel, or burnt at the end and dipped in blood,\r\nto the confines of the enemy's country, and in presence of at least\r\nthree grown-up persons, to say, \"Forasmuch as the states of the ancient\r\nLatins, and the ancient Latin people, have offended against the Roman\r\npeople, the Quirites, forasmuch as the Roman people, the Quirites, have\r\nordered that there should be war with the ancient Latins, and the senate\r\nof the Roman people, the Quirites, have given their opinion, consented,\r\nand voted that war should be made with the ancient Latins, on this\r\naccount I and the Roman people declare and make war on the states of the\r\nancient Latins, and on the ancient Latin people.\" After he had said\r\nthat, he threw the spear within their confines. After this manner\r\nrestitution was demanded from the Latins at that time, and war\r\nproclaimed: and that usage posterity have adopted.\r\n\r\n33. Ancus, having committed the care of sacred things to the flamines\r\nand other priests, set out with a new army, which he had levied, and\r\ntook Politorium, a city of the Latins, by storm; and following the\r\nexample of former kings, who had increased the Roman state by taking\r\nenemies into the number of the citizens, he transplanted all the people\r\nto Rome. And since the Sabines occupied the Capitol and citadel, and the\r\nAlbans the Cœlian mount around the Palatium, the residence of the old\r\nRomans, the Aventine was assigned to the new people; not long after, on\r\nTelleni and Ficana being taken, new citizens were added in the same\r\nquarter. After this Politorium was taken a second time by force of arms,\r\nbecause the ancient Latins had taken possession of it when vacated. This\r\nwas the cause of the Romans demolishing that city, that it might not\r\never after serve as a receptacle to the enemy. At last, the whole war\r\nwith the Latins being concentrated in Medullia, they fought there with\r\nvarious fortune, sometimes the one and sometimes the other gaining the\r\nvictory; for the town was both well fortified by works, and strengthened\r\nby a strong garrison, and the Latins, having pitched their camp in the\r\nopen fields, had several times fought the Romans in close engagement. At\r\nlast Ancus, making an effort with all his forces, obtained a complete\r\nvictory over them in a pitched battle, and having got a considerable\r\nbooty, returned thence to Rome; many thousands of the Latins being then\r\nalso admitted into the city, to whom, in order that the Aventine might\r\nbe joined to the Palatium, a settlement was assigned near the temple of\r\nMurcia. The Janiculum was likewise added, not for want of room, but lest\r\nat any time it should become a lodgment for the enemy. It was determined\r\nto join it to the city, not only by a wall, but likewise, for the sake\r\nof the convenience of passage, by a wooden bridge, then for the first\r\ntime built across the Tiber. The Fossa Quiritium, no inconsiderable\r\ndefence against the easy access to the city from the low grounds, is the\r\nwork of king Ancus. The state being augmented by such great accessions,\r\nseeing that, amid such a multitude of persons, the distinction of right\r\nand wrong being as yet confounded, clandestine crimes were committed, a\r\nprison is built in the heart of the city, overlooking the forum, to\r\nintimidate the growing licentiousness. And not only was the city\r\nincreased under this king, but the territory also and the boundaries.\r\nThe Mæsian forest was taken from the Veientes, the Roman dominion was\r\nextended as far as the sea, and the city of Ostia built at the mouth of\r\nthe Tiber; salt-pits were formed around it, and, in consequence of the\r\ndistinguished success achieved in war, the temple of Jupiter Feretrius\r\nwas enlarged.\r\n\r\n34. In the reign of Ancus, Lucumo, a rich and enterprising man, came to\r\nsettle at Rome, prompted chiefly by the desire and hope of obtaining\r\ngreat preferment there, which he had no means of attaining at Tarquinii\r\n(for there also he was descended from an alien stock). He was the son of\r\nDemaratus, a Corinthian, who, flying his country for sedition, had\r\nhappened to settle at Tarquinii, and having married a wife there, had\r\ntwo sons by her. Their names were [48]Lucumo and Aruns. Lucumo survived\r\nhis father, and became heir to all his property. Aruns died before his\r\nfather, leaving a wife pregnant. The father did not long survive the\r\nson, and as he, not knowing that his daughter-in-law was pregnant, died\r\nwithout taking any notice of his grandchild in his will, to the boy that\r\nwas born after the death of his grandfather, without having any share in\r\nhis fortune, the name of Egerius was given on account of his poverty.\r\nAnd when his wealth already inspired Lucumo, on the other hand, the heir\r\nof all his father's wealth, with elevated notions, Tanaquil, whom he\r\nmarried, further increased such feeling, she being descended from a very\r\nhigh family, and one who would not readily brook the condition into\r\nwhich she had married to be inferior to that in which she had been born.\r\nAs the Etrurians despised Lucumo, because sprung from a foreign exile,\r\nshe could not bear the affront, and regardless of the innate love of her\r\nnative country, provided she might see her husband advanced to honours,\r\nshe formed the determination to leave Tarquinii. Rome seemed\r\nparticularly suited for her purpose. In this state, lately founded,\r\nwhere all nobility is recent and the result of merit, there would be\r\nroom for her husband, a man of courage and activity. Tatius a Sabine had\r\nbeen king of Rome: Numa had been sent for from Cures to reign there:\r\nAncus was sprung from a Sabine mother, and rested his nobility on the\r\nsingle statue of Numa. She easily persuades him, as being ambitious of\r\nhonours, and one to whom Tarquinii was his country only on the mother's\r\nside. Accordingly, removing their effects they set out together for\r\nRome. They happened to have reached the Janiculum; there, as he sat in\r\nthe chariot with his wife, an eagle, suspended on her wings, gently\r\nstooping, takes off his cap, and flying round the chariot with loud\r\nscreams, as if she had been sent from heaven for the very purpose,\r\norderly replaced it on his head, and then flew aloft. Tanaquil is said\r\nto have received this omen with great joy, being a woman well skilled,\r\nas the Etrurians generally are, in celestial prodigies, and embracing\r\nher husband, bids him hope for high and elevated fortune: that such bird\r\nhad come from such a quarter of the heavens, and the messenger of such a\r\ngod: that it had exhibited the omen around the highest part of man: that\r\nit had lifted the ornament placed on the head of man, to restore it to\r\nthe same, by direction of the gods. Carrying with them these hopes and\r\nthoughts, they entered the city, and having purchased a house there,\r\nthey gave out the name of Lucius Tarquinius Priscus. His being a\r\nstranger and very rich, caused him to be taken notice of by the Romans.\r\nHe also promoted his own good fortune by his affable address, by the\r\ncourteousness of his invitations, and by conciliating those whom he\r\ncould by acts of kindness; until a report of him reached even to the\r\npalace; and by paying court to the king with politeness and address, he\r\nin a short time so improved the acquaintance to the footing of intimate\r\nfriendship, that he was present at all public and private deliberations,\r\nforeign and domestic; and being now tried in every trust, he was at\r\nlength, by the king's will, appointed guardian to his children.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: The Lucumones were a class of persons among the Etrurians\r\nof a warlike sacerdotal character, patricians, not kings. Vid. Niebuhr,\r\ni. p. 372.]\r\n\r\n35. Ancus reigned twenty-four years, equal to any of the former kings\r\nboth in the arts and renown of war and peace. His sons were now nigh\r\nthe age of puberty, for this reason Tarquin was more urgent that the\r\nassembly for the election of a king should be held as soon as possible.\r\nThe assembly being proclaimed, he sent away the boys to hunt towards the\r\ntime of their meeting. He is said to have been the first who earnestly\r\nsued for the crown, and to have made a set speech for the purpose of\r\ngaining the affections of the people: _he said_ \"that he did not aim at\r\nany thing unprecedented; for that he was not the first foreigner, (a\r\nthing at which any one might feel indignation or surprise,) but the\r\nthird who aspired to the sovereignty of Rome. That Tatius not only from\r\nbeing an alien, but even an enemy, was made king: that Numa,\r\nunacquainted with the city, and without soliciting it, had been\r\nvoluntarily invited by them to the throne. That he, as soon as he was\r\nhis own master, had come to Rome with his wife and whole fortune, and\r\nhad there spent a greater part of that age, in which men are employed in\r\ncivil offices, than he had in his native country: that he had both in\r\npeace and war thoroughly learned the Roman laws and religious customs,\r\nunder a master not to be objected to, king Ancus himself; that he had\r\nvied with all in duty and loyalty to his prince, and even with the king\r\nhimself in his bounty to others.\" While he was recounting these\r\nundoubted facts, the people by a great majority elected him king. The\r\nsame ambition which had prompted Tarquin, in other respects an excellent\r\nman, to aspire to the crown, followed him whilst on the throne. And\r\nbeing no less mindful of strengthening his own power, than of increasing\r\nthat of the commonwealth, he elected a hundred into the fathers, who\r\nfrom that time were called Minorum Gentium, _i. e._ of the younger\r\nfamilies: a party hearty in the king's cause, by whose favour they had\r\ngot into the senate. The first war he waged was with the Latins, from\r\nwhom he took the town of Apiolæ by storm, and having brought back thence\r\nmore booty than the character of the war would lead one to expect, he\r\ncelebrated games with more cost and magnificence than former kings. The\r\nplace for the circus, which is now called Maximus, was then first marked\r\nout, and spaces were parted off for the senators and knights, where they\r\nmight each erect seats for themselves: they were called fori (benches).\r\nThey viewed the games from scaffolding which supported seats twelve\r\nfeet high from the ground. The show took place; horses and boxers were\r\nsent for, chiefly from Etruria. These solemn games afterwards continued\r\nannual, being variously called the Roman and Great (games). By the same\r\nking also spaces round the forum were portioned off for private\r\nindividuals to build on; porticoes and shops were erected.\r\n\r\n36. He was also preparing to surround the city with a stone wall, when a\r\nSabine war obstructed his designs. The matter was so sudden, that the\r\nenemy had passed the Anio before the Roman army could meet and stop\r\nthem; great alarm therefore was produced at Rome. And at first they\r\nfought with dubious success, but with great slaughter on both sides.\r\nAfter this, the enemy's forces being led back into their camp, and the\r\nRomans getting time to make new levies for the war, Tarquin, thinking\r\nthat the weakness of his army lay in the want of horse, determined to\r\nadd other centuries to the Ramnenses, the Titienses, and Luceres which\r\nRomulus had appointed, and to leave them distinguished by his own name.\r\nBecause Romulus had done this by augury, Attus Navius, at that time a\r\ncelebrated soothsayer, insisted that no alteration or new appointment of\r\nthat kind could be made, unless the birds approved of it. The king,\r\nenraged at this, and, as it is related, ridiculing the art, said, \"Come,\r\nthou diviner, tell me, whether what I am thinking on can be done or\r\nnot?\" When he had tried the matter by divination, he affirmed it\r\ncertainly could. \"But I was thinking,\" says he, \"whether you could cut\r\nasunder this whetstone with a razor. Take it, and perform what thy birds\r\nportend may be done.\" Upon this, as they say, he immediately cut the\r\nwhetstone in two. A statue of Attus, with his head veiled, was erected\r\nin the comitium, upon the very steps on the left of the senate-house, on\r\nthe spot where the transaction occurred. They say that the whetstone\r\nalso was deposited in the same place, that it might remain a monument of\r\nthat miracle to posterity. There certainly accrued so much honour to\r\naugury and the college of augurs, that nothing was undertaken either in\r\npeace or war without taking the auspices. Assemblies of the people, the\r\nsummoning of armies, and affairs of the greatest importance were put\r\noff, when the birds would not allow of them. Nor did Tarquin then make\r\nany other alteration in the centuries of horse, except doubling the\r\nnumber of men in each of these corps, so that the three centuries\r\nconsisted of one thousand eight hundred knights. Those that were added\r\nwere called \"the younger,\" but by the same names with the former; which,\r\nnow that they have been doubled, they call six centuries.\r\n\r\n37. This part of his forces being augmented, a second battle is fought\r\nwith the Sabines. But, besides that the Roman army was thus reinforced,\r\na stratagem also is secretly resorted to, persons having been sent to\r\nthrow into the river a great quantity of timber that lay on the banks of\r\nthe Anio, it being first set on fire; and the wood being further kindled\r\nby favour of the wind, and the greater[49] part of it (being placed) on\r\nrafts, when it stuck firmly impacted against the piers, sets the bridge\r\non fire. This accident struck terror into the Sabines during the battle,\r\nand, after they were routed, impeded their flight; so that many, who had\r\nescaped the enemy, perished in the river. Their arms floating down the\r\nTiber, and being recognised at the city, made known the victory, almost\r\nbefore any account of it could be carried there. In that action the\r\nglory of the cavalry was prominent: they say that, being posted in the\r\ntwo wings, when the centre of their own infantry was being beaten, they\r\ncharged so briskly in flank, that they not only checked the Sabine\r\nlegions who pressed hard on those who retired, but quickly put them to\r\nflight. The Sabines made for the mountains with great precipitation, yet\r\nfew reached them; for, as we said before, the greatest part were driven\r\nby the cavalry into the river. Tarquin, thinking it advisable to pursue\r\nthe enemy closely while in this consternation, after sending the booty\r\nand the prisoners to Rome, piling up and burning the spoils which he had\r\nvowed to Vulcan, proceeds to lead his army onward into the Sabine\r\nterritory. And though matters had turned out adversely, nor could they\r\nhope for better success; yet, because the occasion did not allow time\r\nfor deliberation, the Sabines came out to meet him with a hastily raised\r\narmy; and being again defeated there, and matters having now become\r\ndesperate, they sued for peace.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: In my version of this passage I have followed the reading,\r\n_et pleraque in ratibus, impacta sublicis quum hærerent_, p. i. The\r\nburning logs were not sent down the river one by one, but were placed on\r\nrafts, so that being incapable of passing on between the piers of the\r\nbridge, they firmly stuck there, and burnt the bridge. This mode of\r\ninterpretation is confirmed by Dion. iii. 5, 6. The bridge here meant is\r\nthe one built by the Sabines at the confluence of the Anio and the\r\nTiber----Another reading is, _pleraque in ratibus impacta subliciis quam\r\nhærerent_, \"most of them being driven against the boats, resting on\r\npiles, stuck there,\" &c.]\r\n\r\n38. Collatia and all the land about it was taken from the Sabines, and\r\nEgerius, son to the king's brother, was left there with a garrison. I\r\nunderstand that the people of Collatia were thus surrendered, and that\r\nthe form of the surrender was as follows: the king asked them, \"Are ye\r\nambassadors and deputies sent by the people of Collatia to surrender\r\nyourselves and the people of Collatia?\" \"We are.\" \"Are the people of\r\nCollatia their own masters?\" \"They are.\" \"Do ye surrender yourselves and\r\nthe people of Collatia, their city, lands, water, boundaries, temples,\r\nutensils, and every thing sacred or profane belonging to them, into my\r\npower, and that of the Roman people?\" \"We do.\" \"Then I receive them.\"\r\nThe Sabine war being ended, Tarquin returned in triumph to Rome. After\r\nthat he made war upon the ancient Latins, where they came on no occasion\r\nto a general engagement; yet by carrying about his arms to the several\r\ntowns, he subdued the whole Latin nation. Corniculum, old Ficulea,\r\nCameria, Crustumerium, Ameriola, Medullia, and Nomentum, towns which\r\neither belonged to the ancient Latins, or which had revolted to them,\r\nwere taken. Upon this a peace was concluded. The works of peace were\r\nthen set about with greater spirit, even than the efforts with which he\r\nhad conducted his wars; so that the people enjoyed no more ease and\r\nquiet at home, than they had done abroad: for he both set about\r\nsurrounding the city with a stone wall, on the side where he had not\r\nfortified it, the beginning of which work had been interrupted by the\r\nSabine war, and the lower parts of the city round the forum and the\r\nother valleys lying between the hills, because they did not easily carry\r\noff the water from the flat grounds, he drains by means of sewers drawn\r\nsloping downward into the Tiber. Moreover he levels an area for founding\r\na temple to Jupiter in the Capitol, which he had vowed to him in the\r\nSabine war; his mind even then presaging the future grandeur of the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n39. At that time, a prodigy occurred in the palace, wonderful both in\r\nits appearance and in its result. They relate, that the head of a boy,\r\ncalled Servius Tullius, as he lay fast asleep, blazed with fire in the\r\nsight of many persons. That by the very great noise made at so\r\nmiraculous a phenomenon, the royal family were awakened; and when one of\r\nthe servants was bringing water to extinguish the flame, that he was\r\nkept back by the queen, and after the confusion was over, that she\r\nforbade the boy to be disturbed till he should awake of his own accord.\r\nAs soon as he awoke the flame disappeared. Then Tanaquil, taking her\r\nhusband into a private place, said, \"Do you observe this boy whom we\r\nbring up in so mean a style? Be assured that hereafter he will be a\r\nlight to us in our adversity, and a protector to our palace in distress.\r\nFrom henceforth let us, with all our care, train up this youth, who is\r\ncapable of becoming a great ornament publicly and privately.\" From this\r\ntime the boy began to be treated as their own son, and instructed in\r\nthose arts by which men's minds are qualified to maintain high rank. The\r\nmatter was easily accomplished, because it was agreeable to the gods.\r\nThe young man turned out to be of a disposition truly royal. Nor, when\r\nthey looked out for a son-in-law for Tarquin, could any of the Roman\r\nyouth be compared to him in any accomplishment; therefore the king\r\nbetrothed his own daughter to him. This high honour conferred upon him,\r\nfrom whatever cause, prevents us from believing that he was the son of a\r\nslave, and that he had himself been a slave when young. I am rather of\r\nthe opinion of those who say that, on the taking of Corniculum, the wife\r\nof Servius Tullius, who had been the leading man in that city, being\r\npregnant when her husband was slain, being known among the other female\r\nprisoners, and, in consequence of her high rank, exempted from servitude\r\nby the Roman queen, was delivered of a child at Rome, in the house of\r\nTarquinius Priscus. Upon this, that both the intimacy between the ladies\r\nwas improved by so great a kindness, and that the boy, having been\r\nbrought up in the house from his infancy, was beloved and respected;\r\nthat his mother's lot, in having fallen into the hands of the enemy,\r\ncaused him to be considered the son of a slave.\r\n\r\n40. About the thirty-eighth year of Tarquin's reign, Servius Tullius was\r\nin the highest esteem, not only with the king, but also with the senate\r\nand people. At this time the two sons of Ancus, though they had before\r\nthat always considered it the highest indignity that they had been\r\ndeprived of their father's crown by the treachery of their guardian,\r\nthat a stranger should be king of Rome, who was not only not of a\r\ncivic, but not even of an Italian family, yet now felt their indignation\r\nrise to a still higher pitch at the notion that the crown would not only\r\nnot revert to them after Tarquin, but would descend even lower to a\r\nslave, so that in the same state about the hundredth year[50] after\r\nRomulus, descended from a deity, and a deity himself, occupied the\r\nthrone as long as he lived, a slave, and one born of a slave, should now\r\npossess it. That it would be a disgrace both common to the Roman name,\r\nand more especially to their family, if, whilst there was male issue of\r\nking Ancus still living, the sovereignty of Rome should be accessible\r\nnot only to strangers, but even to slaves. They determine therefore to\r\nprevent that disgrace by the sword. But both resentment for the injury\r\ndone to them incensed them more against Tarquin himself, than against\r\nServius; and (the consideration) that a king was likely to prove a more\r\nsevere avenger of the murder, if he should survive, than a private\r\nperson; and moreover, in case of Servius being put to death, whatever\r\nother person he might select as his son-in-law,[51] it seemed likely\r\nthat he would adopt as his successor on the throne.[52] For these\r\nreasons the plot is laid against the king himself. Two of the most\r\nferocious of the shepherds being selected for the daring deed, with the\r\nrustic implements to which each had been accustomed, by conducting\r\nthemselves in as violent a manner as possible in the porch of the\r\npalace, under pretence of a quarrel, draw the attention of all the\r\nking's attendants to themselves; then, when both appealed to the king,\r\nand their clamour reached even the interior of the palace, they are\r\ncalled in and proceed before the king. At first both bawled aloud, and\r\nvied in interrupting each other by their clamour, until being restrained\r\nby the lictor, and commanded to speak in turns, they at length cease\r\nrailing. According to concert, one begins to state the matter. When the\r\nking, attentive to him, had turned himself quite that way, the other,\r\nraising up his axe, struck it into his head, and leaving the weapon in\r\nthe wound, they both rush out of the house.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: _The hundredth year_. 138 years had elapsed since the\r\ndeath of Romulus: they diminish the number of years designedly, to make\r\nthe matter appear still worse.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: _Son-in-law_. Why not one of his two sons, Lucius and\r\nAruns? Dio. iv. 1. If these were not his grandchildren rather, they must\r\nhave been infants at the time. Dio. iv. 4, 6.--At this time infants\r\ncould not succeed to the throne.--_Ruperti._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: This sentence has given some trouble to the\r\ncommentators.--Some will have it that three distinct reasons are given\r\nfor assassinating Tarquinius rather than Servius Tullius, and that these\r\nare severally marked and distinguished by _et_--_et_--_tum_, the second\r\nonly having _quia_.--Stroth will have it that only two reasons are\r\nassigned, one, why the king should be killed, and the other, why Servius\r\nTullius should not be killed, arising from the danger and uselessness of\r\nthe act--the former has not a _quia_, because it was a fact, (_et\r\ninjuriæ dolor_, &c.,) while the latter has it in the first part (the\r\ndanger, _et quia gravior_, &c, _quia_ being understood also before the\r\nother, the uselessness, _tum_, _Servio occiso_, &c.) because it\r\ncontained the reasoning of the youths. Doering says there were only two\r\npowerful reasons, revenge and fear, and a ratio probabilis introduced by\r\n_tum_; which has the force of insuper. According to Dr. Hunter, there\r\nare two formal assertions, one, that resentment stimulated the sons of\r\nAncus against the king himself; the other, that the plot is laid for the\r\nking himself upon two considerations, of reason and policy.]\r\n\r\n41. When those who were around had raised up the king in a dying state,\r\nthe lictors seize on the men who were endeavouring to escape. Upon this\r\nfollowed an uproar and concourse of people, wondering what the matter\r\nwas. Tanaquil, during the tumult, orders the palace to be shut, thrusts\r\nout all who were present: at the same time she sedulously prepares every\r\nthing necessary for dressing the wound, as if a hope still remained; at\r\nthe same time, in case her hopes should disappoint her, she projects\r\nother means of safety. Sending immediately for Servius, after she had\r\nshowed to him her husband almost expiring, holding his right hand, she\r\nentreats him not to suffer the death of his father-in-law to pass\r\nunavenged, nor his mother-in-law to be an object of insult to their\r\nenemies. \"Servius,\" she said, \"if you are a man, the kingdom is yours,\r\nnot theirs, who, by the hands of others, have perpetrated the worst of\r\ncrimes. Exert yourself, and follow the guidance of the gods, who\r\nportended that this head would be illustrious by having formerly shed a\r\nblaze around it. Now let that celestial flame arouse you. Now awake in\r\nearnest. We, too, though foreigners, have reigned. Consider who you are,\r\nnot whence you are sprung. If your own plans are not matured by reason\r\nof the suddenness of this event, then follow mine.\" When the uproar and\r\nviolence of the multitude could scarcely be withstood, Tanaquil\r\naddresses the populace from the upper part of the palace through the\r\nwindows facing the new street (for the royal family resided near the\r\ntemple of Jupiter Stator). She bids them \"be of good courage; that the\r\nking was stunned by the suddenness of the blow; that the weapon had not\r\nsunk deep into his body; that he was already come to himself again; that\r\nthe wound had been examined, the blood having been wiped off; that all\r\nthe symptoms were favourable; that she hoped they would see him very\r\nsoon; and that, in the mean time, he commanded the people to obey the\r\norders of Servius Tullius. That he would administer justice, and would\r\nperform all the functions of the king.\" Servius comes forth with the\r\ntrabea and lictors, and seating himself on the king's throne, decides\r\nsome cases, with respect to others pretends that he will consult the\r\nking. Therefore, the death being concealed for several days, though\r\nTarquin had already expired, he, under pretence of discharging the duty\r\nof another, strengthened his own interest. Then at length the matter\r\nbeing made public, and lamentations being raised in the palace, Servius,\r\nsupported by a strong guard, took possession of the kingdom by the\r\nconsent of the senate, being the first who did so without the orders of\r\nthe people. The children of Ancus, the instruments of their villany\r\nhaving been already seized, as soon as it was announced that the king\r\nstill lived, and that the power of Servius was so great, had already\r\ngone into exile to Suessa Pometia.\r\n\r\n42. And now Servius began to strengthen his power, not more by\r\npublic[53] than by private measures; and lest the feelings of the\r\nchildren of Tarquin might be the same towards himself as those of the\r\nchildren of Ancus had been towards Tarquin, he unites his two daughters\r\nin marriage to the young princes, the Tarquinii, Lucius and Aruns. Nor\r\nyet did he break through the inevitable decrees of fate by human\r\nmeasures, so that envy of the sovereign power should not produce general\r\ntreachery and animosity even among the members of his own family. Very\r\nopportunely for maintaining the tranquillity of the present state, a war\r\nwas commenced with the Veientes (for the truce had now expired[54]) and\r\nwith the other Etrurians. In that war, both the valour and good fortune\r\nof Tullius were conspicuous, and he returned to Rome, after routing a\r\ngreat army of the enemy, now unquestionably king, whether he tried the\r\ndispositions of the fathers or the people. He then sets about a work of\r\npeace of the utmost importance; that, as Numa had been the author of\r\nreligious institutions, so posterity might celebrate Servius as the\r\nfounder of all distinction among the members of the state, and of those\r\norders by which a limitation is established between the degrees of rank\r\nand fortune. For he instituted the census, a most salutary measure for\r\nan empire destined to become so great, according to which the services\r\nof war and peace were to be performed, not by every person,\r\n(indiscriminately,) as formerly, but in proportion to the amount of\r\nproperty. Then he formed, according to the census, the classes and\r\ncenturies, and the arrangement as it now exists, eminently suited either\r\nto peace or war.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: By _public_--_private_. The \"public\" were the steps taken\r\nby Servius to establish his political ascendency, whilst the \"private\"\r\nrefer to those intended to strengthen his family connexions.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: _The truce had now expired._ If the truce concluded with\r\nthem by Romulus be here meant, it was long since expired, since about\r\n140 years had now elapsed. It is probable, however, that it was renewed\r\nin the reign of Tullius.]\r\n\r\n43. Of those who had an estate of a hundred thousand asses or more, he\r\nmade eighty centuries, forty of seniors and forty of juniors. All these\r\nwere called the first class, the seniors were to be in readiness to\r\nguard the city, the juniors to carry on war abroad. The arms enjoined\r\nthem were a helmet, a round shield, greaves, and a coat of mail, all of\r\nbrass; these were for the defence of their body; their weapons of\r\noffence were a spear and a sword. To this class were added two centuries\r\nof mechanics, who were to serve without arms; the duty imposed upon them\r\nwas to carry the military engines. The second class comprehended all\r\nwhose estate was from seventy-five to a hundred thousand asses, and of\r\nthese, seniors and juniors, twenty centuries were enrolled. The arms\r\nenjoined them were a buckler instead of a shield, and except a coat of\r\nmail, all the rest were the same. He appointed the property of the third\r\nclass to amount to fifty thousand asses; the number of centuries was the\r\nsame, and formed with the same distinction of age, nor was there any\r\nchange in their arms, only greaves were taken from them. In the fourth\r\nclass, the property was twenty-five thousand asses, the same number of\r\ncenturies was formed: the arms were changed, nothing was given them but\r\na spear and a long javelin. The fifth class was increased, thirty\r\ncenturies were formed; these carried slings and stones for throwing.\r\nAmong them were reckoned the horn-blowers, and the trumpeters,\r\ndistributed into three centuries. This whole class was rated at eleven\r\nthousand asses. Property lower than this comprehended all the rest of\r\nthe citizens, and of them one century was made up which was exempted\r\nfrom serving in war. Having thus divided and armed the infantry, he\r\nlevied twelve centuries of knights from among the chief men of the\r\nstate. Likewise out of the three centuries, appointed by Romulus, he\r\nformed other six under the same names which they had received at their\r\nfirst institution. Ten thousand asses were given them out of the public\r\nrevenue, for the buying of horses, and widows were assigned them, who\r\nwere to pay two thousand asses yearly for the support of the horses. All\r\nthese burdens were taken off the poor and laid on the rich. Then an\r\nadditional honour was conferred upon them; for the suffrage was not now\r\ngranted promiscuously to all, as it had been established by Romulus, and\r\nobserved by his successors, to every man with the same privilege and the\r\nsame right, but gradations were established, so that no one might seem\r\nexcluded from the right of voting, and yet the whole power might reside\r\nin the chief men of the state. For the knights were first called, and\r\nthen the eighty centuries of the first class; and if they happened to\r\ndiffer, which was seldom the case, those of the second were called: and\r\nthey seldom ever descended so low as to come to the lowest class. Nor\r\nneed we be surprised, that the present regulation, which now exists,\r\nsince the tribes were increased to thirty-five, should not agree in the\r\nnumber of centuries of juniors and seniors with the amount instituted by\r\nServius Tullius, they being now double of what they were at that time.\r\nFor the city being divided into four parts, according to the regions and\r\nhills which were then inhabited, he called these divisions tribes, as I\r\nthink, from the tribute.[55] For the method of levying taxes rateably\r\naccording to the value of estates was also introduced by him; nor had\r\nthese tribes any relation to the number and distribution of the\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: Varro, de L.L. iv. 36, thinks, on the contrary, that\r\n_tributum_ was so called, as being paid by the _tribes_.]\r\n\r\n44. The census being now completed, which he had expedited by the terror\r\nof a law passed on those not rated, with threats of imprisonment and\r\ndeath, he issued a proclamation that all the Roman citizens, horse and\r\nfoot, should attend at the dawn of day in the Campus Martius, each in\r\nhis century. There he drew up his army and performed a lustration of it\r\nby the sacrifices called suovetaurilia, and that was called the closing\r\nof the lustrum, because that was the conclusion of the census. Eighty\r\nthousand citizens are said to have been rated in that survey. Fabius\r\nPictor, the oldest of our historians, adds, that such was the number of\r\nthose who were able to bear arms. To accommodate that number the city\r\nseemed to require enlargement. He adds two hills, the Quirinal and\r\nViminal; then in continuation he enlarges the Esquiliæ, and takes up his\r\nown residence there, in order that respectability might attach to the\r\nplace. He surrounds the city with a rampart, a moat, and a wall: thus he\r\nenlarges the pomœrium. They who regard only the etymology of the\r\nword, will have the pomœrium to be a space of ground without the\r\nwalls; but it is rather a space on each side the wall, which the\r\nEtrurians in building cities consecrated by augury, reaching to a\r\ncertain extent both within and without in the direction they intended to\r\nraise the wall; so that the houses might not be joined to it on the\r\ninside, as they commonly are now, and also that there might be some\r\nspace without left free from human occupation. This space, which it was\r\nnot lawful to till or inhabit, the Romans called the pomœrium, not\r\nfor its being without the wall, more than for the wall's being without\r\nit: and in enlarging the city, as far as the walls were intended to\r\nproceed outwards, so far these consecrated limits were likewise\r\nextended.\r\n\r\n45. The state being increased by the enlargement of the city, and every\r\nthing modelled at home and abroad for the exigencies both of peace and\r\nwar, that the acquisition of power might not always depend on mere force\r\nof arms, he endeavoured to extend his empire by policy, and at the same\r\ntime to add some ornament to the city. [56]The temple of Diana at\r\nEphesus was at that time in high renown; fame represented it to have\r\nbeen built by all the states of Asia, in common. When Servius, amid some\r\ngrandees of the Latins with whom he had taken pains to form connexions\r\nof hospitality and friendship, extolled in high terms such concord and\r\nassociation of their gods, by frequently insisting on the same subject,\r\nhe at length prevailed so far as that the Latin states agreed to build a\r\ntemple to Diana at Rome, in conjunction with the Roman people. This was\r\nan acknowledgment that Rome was the head of both nations, concerning\r\nwhich they had so often disputed in arms. Though that object seemed to\r\nhave been left out of consideration by all the Latins, in consequence of\r\nthe matter having been so often attempted unsuccessfully by arms,\r\nfortune seemed to present one of the Sabines with an opportunity of\r\nrecovering the superiority to his country by his own address. A cow is\r\nsaid to have been calved to a certain person, the head of a family among\r\nthe Sabines, of surprising size and beauty. Her horns, which were hung\r\nup in the porch of the temple of Diana, remained, for many ages, a\r\nmonument of this wonder. The thing was looked upon as a prodigy, as it\r\nwas, and the soothsayers declared, that sovereignty would reside in that\r\nstate of which a citizen should immolate this heifer to Diana. This\r\nprediction had also reached the ears of the high priest of Diana. The\r\nSabine, when he thought the proper time for offering the sacrifice was\r\ncome, drove the cow to Rome, led her to the temple of that goddess, and\r\nset her before the altar. The Roman priest, struck with the uncommon\r\nsize of the victim, so much celebrated by fame, thus accosted the\r\nSabine: \"What intendest thou to do, stranger?\" says he. \"Is it with\r\nimpure hands to offer a sacrifice to Diana? Why dost not thou first wash\r\nthyself in running water? The Tiber runs along in the bottom of that\r\nvalley.\" The stranger, being seized with a scruple of conscience, and\r\ndesirous of having every thing done in due form, that the event might\r\nanswer the prediction, from the temple went down to the Tiber. In the\r\nmean time the priest sacrificed the cow to Diana, which gave great\r\nsatisfaction to the king, and to the whole state.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: _Temple of Diana_. Built on the summit of the Aventine\r\nmount towards the Tiber. On its brazen pillar were engraved the laws of\r\nthe treaty, and which were still extant in the time of Augustus.]\r\n\r\n46. Servius, though he had now acquired an indisputable right to the\r\nkingdom by long possession, yet as he heard that expressions were\r\nsometimes thrown out by young Tarquin, importing, \"That he held the\r\ncrown without the consent of the people,\" having first secured their\r\ngood will by dividing among them, man by man, the lands taken from their\r\nenemies, he ventured to propose the question to the people, whether they\r\n\"chose and ordered that he should be king,\" and was declared king with\r\nsuch unanimity, as had not been observed in the election of any of his\r\npredecessors. But this circumstance diminished not Tarquin's hope of\r\nobtaining the throne; nay, because he had observed that the question of\r\nthe distribution of land to the people[57] was carried against the will\r\nof the fathers, he felt so much the more satisfied that an opportunity\r\nwas now presented to him of arraigning Servius before the fathers, and\r\nof increasing his own influence in the senate, he being himself\r\nnaturally of a fiery temper, and his wife, Tullia, at home stimulating\r\nhis restless temper. For the Roman palace also afforded an instance of\r\ntragic guilt, so that through their disgust of kings, liberty might come\r\nmore matured, and the throne, which should be attained through crime,\r\nmight be the last. This L. Tarquinius (whether he was the son or\r\ngrandson of Tarquinius Priscus is not clear; with the greater number of\r\nauthorities, however, I would say, his son[58]) had a brother, Aruns\r\nTarquinius, a youth of a mild disposition. To these two, as has been\r\nalready stated, the two Tulliæ, daughters of the king, had been married,\r\nthey also being of widely different tempers. It had so happened that the\r\ntwo violent dispositions were not united in marriage, through the good\r\nfortune, I suspect, of the Roman people, in order that the reign of\r\nServius might be more protracted, and the morals of the state be firmly\r\nestablished. The haughty Tullia was chagrined, that there was no\r\nmaterial in her husband, either for ambition or bold daring. Directing\r\nall her regard to the other Tarquinius, him she admired, him she called\r\na man, and one truly descended of royal blood; she expressed her\r\ncontempt of her sister, because, having got a man, she was deficient in\r\nthe spirit becoming a woman. Similarity of mind soon draws them\r\ntogether, as wickedness is in general most congenial to wickedness. But\r\nthe commencement of producing general confusion originated with the\r\nwoman. She, accustomed to the secret conversations of the other's\r\nhusband, refrained not from using the most contumelious language of her\r\nhusband to his brother, of her sister to (her sister's) husband, and\r\ncontended, that it were better that she herself were unmarried, and he\r\nsingle, than that they should be matched unsuitably, so that they must\r\nlanguish away through life by reason of the dastardly conduct of others.\r\nIf the gods had granted her the husband of whom she was worthy, that she\r\nshould soon see the crown in her own house, which she now saw at her\r\nfather's. She soon inspires the young man with her own daring notions.\r\nAruns Tarquinius and the younger Tullia, when they had, by immediate\r\nsuccessive deaths, made their houses vacant for new nuptials, are united\r\nin marriage, Servius rather not prohibiting than approving the measure.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: This is noticed as the first trace of the Agrarian\r\ndivision by Niebuhr, i. p. 161.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: _His son_. Dionysius will have it that he was the\r\ngrandson. See Nieb. i. p. 367.]\r\n\r\n47. Then indeed the old age of Servius began to be every day more\r\ndisquieted, his reign to be more unhappy. For now the woman looked from\r\none crime to another, and suffered not her husband to rest by night or\r\nby day, lest their past murders might go for nothing. \"That what she had\r\nwanted was not a person whose wife she might be called, or one with whom\r\nshe might in silence live a slave; what she had wanted was one who would\r\nconsider himself worthy of the throne; who would remember that he was\r\nthe son of Tarquinius Priscus; who would rather possess a kingdom than\r\nhope for it. If you, to whom I consider myself married, are such a one,\r\nI address you both as husband and king; but if not, our condition has\r\nbeen changed so far for the worse, as in that person crime is associated\r\nwith meanness. Why not prepare yourself? It is not necessary for you, as\r\nfor your father, (coming here) from Corinth or Tarquinii, to strive for\r\nforeign thrones. Your household and country's gods, the image of your\r\nfather, and the royal palace, and the royal throne in that palace,\r\nconstitute and call you king. Or if you have too little spirit for this,\r\nwhy do you disappoint the nation? Why do you suffer yourself to be\r\nlooked up to as a prince? Get hence to Tarquinii or Corinth. Sink back\r\nagain to your (original) race, more like your brother than your father.\"\r\nBy chiding him in these and other terms, she spurs on the young man; nor\r\ncan she herself rest; (indignant) that when Tanaquil, a foreign woman,\r\ncould achieve so great a project, as to bestow two successive thrones on\r\nher husband, and then on her son-in-law, she, sprung from royal blood,\r\nshould have no weight in bestowing and taking away a kingdom.\r\nTarquinius, driven on by these frenzied instigations of the woman,\r\nbegan to go round and solicit the patricians, especially those of the\r\nyounger families;[59] reminded them of his father's kindness, and\r\nclaimed a return for it; enticed the young men by presents; increased\r\nhis interest, as well by making magnificent promises on his own part, as\r\nby inveighing against the king at every opportunity. At length, as soon\r\nas the time seemed convenient for accomplishing his object, he rushed\r\ninto the forum, accompanied by a party of armed men; then, whilst all\r\nwere struck with dismay, seating himself on the throne before the\r\nsenate-house, he ordered the fathers to be summoned to the senate-house\r\nby the crier to attend king Tarquinius. They assembled immediately, some\r\nbeing already prepared for the occasion, some through fear, lest their\r\nnot having come might prove detrimental to them, astounded at the\r\nnovelty and strangeness of the matter, and considering that it was now\r\nall over with Servius. Then Tarquinius, commencing his invectives\r\nagainst his immediate ancestors: \"that a slave, and born of a slave,\r\nafter the untimely death of his parent, without an interregnum being\r\nadopted, as on former occasions, without any comitia (being held),\r\nwithout the suffrages of the people, or the sanction of the fathers, he\r\nhad taken possession of the kingdom as the gift of a woman. That so\r\nborn, so created king, ever a favourer of the most degraded class, to\r\nwhich he himself belongs, through a hatred of the high station of\r\nothers, he had taken their land from the leading men of the state and\r\ndivided it among the very meanest; that he had laid all the burdens,\r\nwhich were formerly common, on the chief members of the community; that\r\nhe had instituted the census, in order that the fortune of the wealthier\r\ncitizens might be conspicuous to (excite) public envy, and that all was\r\nprepared whence he might bestow largesses on the most needy, whenever he\r\nmight please.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: _Younger families_. These had been brought into the\r\nsenate, as we have seen, by Tarquinius Priscus, and consequently\r\nfavoured the Tarquinian interest. Nieb. i. p. 372.]\r\n\r\n48. When Servius, aroused by the alarming announcement, came in during\r\nthis harangue, immediately from the porch of the senate-house, he says\r\nwith a loud voice, \"What means this, Tarquin? by what audacity hast thou\r\ndared to summon the fathers, while I am still alive? or to sit on my\r\nthrone?\" To this, when he fiercely replied \"that he, the son of a king,\r\noccupied the throne of his father, a much fitter successor to the throne\r\nthan a slave; that he (Servius) had insulted his masters full long\r\nenough by his arbitrary shuffling,\" a shout arises from the partisans of\r\nboth, and a rush of the people into the senate-house took place, and it\r\nbecame evident that whoever came off victor would have the throne. Then\r\nTarquin, necessity itself now obliging him to have recourse to the last\r\nextremity, having much the advantage both in years and strength, seizes\r\nServius by the middle, and having taken him out of the senate-house,\r\nthrows him down the steps to the bottom. He then returns to the\r\nsenate-house to assemble the senate. The king's officers and attendants\r\nfly. He himself, almost lifeless, when he was returning home with his\r\nroyal retinue frightened to death, and had arrived at the top of the\r\nCyprian street, is slain by those who had been sent by Tarquin, and had\r\novertaken him in his flight. As the act is not inconsistent with her\r\nother marked conduct, it is believed to have been done by Tullia's\r\nadvice. Certain it is, (for it is readily admitted,) that driving into\r\nthe forum in her chariot, and not abashed by the crowd of persons there,\r\nshe called her husband out of the senate-house, and was the first to\r\nstyle him king; and when, on being commanded by him to withdraw from\r\nsuch a tumult, she was returning home, and had arrived at the top of the\r\nCyprian street, where Diana's temple lately was, as she was turning to\r\nthe right to the Orbian hill, in order to arrive at the Esquiline, the\r\nperson who was driving, being terrified, stopped and drew in the reins,\r\nand pointed out to his mistress the murdered Servius as he lay. On this\r\noccasion a revolting and inhuman crime is stated to have been committed,\r\nand the place is a monument of it. They call it the Wicked Street, where\r\nTullia, frantic and urged on by the furies of her sister and husband, is\r\nreported to have driven her chariot over her father's body, and to have\r\ncarried a portion of her father's body and blood to her own and her\r\nhusband's household gods, herself also being stained and sprinkled with\r\nit; through whose vengeance results corresponding to the wicked\r\ncommencement of the reign were soon to follow. Tullius reigned\r\nforty-four years in such a manner that a competition with him would\r\nprove difficult even for a good and moderate successor. But this also\r\nhas been an accession to his glory, that with him perished all just and\r\nlegitimate reigns. This authority, so mild and so moderate, yet, because\r\nit was vested in one, some say that he had it in contemplation to\r\nresign,[60] had not the wickedness of his family interfered with him\r\nwhilst meditating the liberation of his country.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: _To resign_. Niebuhr is of opinion that what is said\r\nregarding the Commentaries of Servius Tullius, chap. 60, has reference\r\nto this.]\r\n\r\n49. After this period Tarquin began his reign, whose actions procured\r\nhim the surname of the Proud, for he refused his father-in-law burial,\r\nalleging, that even Romulus died without sepulture. He put to death the\r\nprincipal senators, whom he suspected of having been in the interest of\r\nServius. Then, conscious that the precedent of obtaining the crown by\r\nevil means might be adopted from him against himself, he surrounded his\r\nperson with armed men, for he had no claim to the kingdom except force,\r\ninasmuch as he reigned without either the order of the people or the\r\nsanction of the senate. To this was added (the fact) that, as he reposed\r\nno hope in the affection of his subjects, he found it necessary to\r\nsecure his kingdom by terror; and in order to strike this into the\r\ngreater number, he took cognizance of capital cases solely by himself\r\nwithout assessors; and under that pretext he had it in his power to put\r\nto death, banish, or fine, not only those who were suspected or hated,\r\nbut those also from whom he could obtain nothing else but plunder. The\r\nnumber of the fathers more especially being thus diminished, he\r\ndetermined to elect none into the senate, in order that the order might\r\nbecome contemptible by their very paucity, and that they might feel the\r\nless resentment at no business being transacted by them. For he was the\r\nfirst king who violated the custom derived from his predecessors of\r\nconsulting the senate on all subjects; he administered the public\r\nbusiness by domestic counsels. War, peace, treaties, alliances, he\r\ncontracted and dissolved with whomsoever he pleased, without the\r\nsanction of the people and senate. The nation of the Latins in\r\nparticular he wished to attach to him, so that by foreign influence also\r\nhe might be more secure among his own subjects; and he contracted not\r\nonly ties of hospitality but affinities also with their leading men. To\r\nOctavius Mamilius of Tusculum he gives his daughter in marriage; (he was\r\nby far the most eminent of the Latin name, being descended, if we\r\nbelieve tradition, from Ulysses and the goddess Circe, and by this match\r\nhe attaches to himself his numerous kinsmen and friends).\r\n\r\n50. The influence of Tarquin among the chief men of the Latins was now\r\nconsiderable, when he issues an order that they should assemble on a\r\ncertain day at the grove of Ferentina; that there was business about\r\nwhich he wished to confer with them touching their common interest. They\r\nassemble in great numbers at the break of day. Tarquinius himself\r\nobserved the day indeed, but he came a little before sun-set. Many\r\nmatters were there canvassed in the meeting in various conversations.\r\nTurnus Herdonius, from Aricia, inveighed violently against Tarquin for\r\nhis absence. \"That it was no wonder the cognomen of Proud was given him\r\nat Rome;\" for they now called him so secretly and in whispers, but still\r\ngenerally. \"Could anything be more proud than thus to trifle with the\r\nentire nation of the Latins? After their chiefs had been called at so\r\ngreat a distance from home, that he who summoned the meeting did not\r\nattend; that no doubt their patience was tried, in order that if they\r\nsubmitted to the yoke, he may crush them when at his mercy. For to whom\r\ndid it not plainly appear that he was aiming at sovereignty over the\r\nLatins? But if his own countrymen did well in intrusting it to him, or\r\nif it was intrusted, and not seized on by means of murder, that the\r\nLatins also ought to intrust him (though not even so, inasmuch as he was\r\na foreigner). But if his own subjects are dissatisfied with him, (seeing\r\nthat they are butchered one upon another, driven into exile, and\r\ndeprived of their property,) what better prospects are held out to the\r\nLatins? If they follow his advice, that they would depart thence, each\r\nto his own home, and take no more notice of the day of meeting than the\r\nperson who appointed it.\" When this man, turbulent and daring, and one\r\nwho had attained influence at home by these means, was pressing these\r\nand other observations having the same tendency, Tarquin came in. This\r\nput a conclusion to his harangue. All turned away from him to salute\r\nTarquin, who, on silence being enjoined, being advised by those next him\r\nto apologize for having come at that time, says, that he had been chosen\r\narbiter between a father and a son; that, from his anxiety to reconcile\r\nthem, he had delayed; and because that circumstance had consumed that\r\nday, that on the morrow he would transact the business which he had\r\ndetermined on. They say that he did not make even that observation\r\nwithout a remark from Turnus; \"that no controversy was shorter than one\r\nbetween a father and son, and that it might be decided in a few\r\nwords,--unless he submitted to his father, that he must prove\r\nunfortunate.\"\r\n\r\n51. The Arician withdrew from the meeting, uttering these reflections\r\nagainst the Roman king. Tarquin, feeling the matter much more acutely\r\nthan he appeared to do, immediately sets about planning the death of\r\nTurnus, in order that he might inspire into the Latins the same terror\r\nwith which he had crushed the spirits of his own subjects at home; and\r\nbecause he could not be put to death openly, by virtue of his authority,\r\nhe accomplished the ruin of this innocent man by bringing a false\r\naccusation against him. By means of some Aricians of the opposite\r\nfaction, he bribed a servant of Turnus with gold, to suffer a great\r\nnumber of swords to be introduced privately into his lodging. When this\r\nhad been completed in the course of one night, Tarquin, having summoned\r\nthe chiefs of the Latins to him a little before day, as if alarmed by\r\nsome strange occurrence, says, \"that his delay of yesterday, having been\r\noccasioned as it were by some providential care of the gods, had been\r\nthe means of preservation to him and them; that it was told to him that\r\ndestruction was prepared by Turnus for him and the chiefs of the Latins,\r\nthat he alone might obtain the government of the Latins. That he was to\r\nhave made the attempt yesterday at the meeting; that the matter was\r\ndeferred, because the person who summoned the meeting was absent, whom\r\nhe chiefly aimed at. That thence arose that abuse of him for being\r\nabsent, because he disappointed his hopes by delaying. That he had no\r\ndoubt, but that if the truth were told him, he would come at the break\r\nof day, when the assembly met, attended with a band of conspirators, and\r\nwith arms in his hands. That it was said that a great number of swords\r\nhad been conveyed to his house. Whether that be true or not, might be\r\nknown immediately. He requested that they would accompany him thence to\r\nTurnus.\" Both the daring temper of Turnus, and his harangue of\r\nyesterday, and the delay of Tarquin, rendered the matter suspicious,\r\nbecause it seemed possible that the murder might have been put off in\r\nconsequence of it. They proceed then with minds inclined indeed to\r\nbelieve, yet determined to consider every thing false, unless the swords\r\nwere detected. When they arrived there, Turnus is aroused from sleep,\r\nand guards are placed around him; and the servants, who, from affection\r\nto their master, were preparing to use force, being secured, when the\r\nswords, which had been concealed, were drawn out from all parts of the\r\nlodging, then indeed the whole matter appeared manifest, and chains were\r\nplaced on Turnus; and forthwith a meeting of the Latins was summoned\r\namid great confusion. There, on the swords being brought forward in the\r\nmidst, such violent hatred arose against him, that without being allowed\r\na defence, by a novel mode of death, being thrown into the reservoir of\r\nthe water of Ferentina, a hurdle[61] being placed over him, and stones\r\nbeing thrown into that, he was drowned.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: _Hurdle_, a mode of punishment in use among the\r\nCarthaginians. See Tac. Germ. 12. Similar to the Greek, ?atap??t?sµ??.]\r\n\r\n52. Tarquin, having recalled the Latins to the meeting, and applauded\r\nthose who had inflicted well-merited punishment on Turnus, as one\r\nconvicted of parricide, by his attempting a change of government, spoke\r\nas follows: \"That he could indeed proceed by a long-established right;\r\nbecause, since all the Latins were sprung from Alba, they were included\r\nin that treaty by which the entire Alban nation, with their colonies,\r\nfell under the dominion of Rome, under Tullus. However, for the sake of\r\nthe interest of all parties, he thought rather, that that treaty should\r\nbe renewed; and that the Latins should, as participators, enjoy the\r\nprosperity of the Roman people, rather than that they should be\r\nconstantly either apprehending or suffering the demolition of their town\r\nand the devastations of their lands, which they suffered formerly in the\r\nreign of Ancus, afterwards in the reign of his own father.\" The Latins\r\nwere persuaded without any difficulty, though in that treaty the\r\nadvantage lay on the side of Rome; but they both saw that the chiefs of\r\nthe Latin nation sided and concurred with the king, and Turnus was a\r\nrecent instance of his danger to each, if he should make any opposition.\r\nThus the treaty was renewed, and notice was given to the young men of\r\nthe Latins, that, according to the treaty, they should attend in\r\nconsiderable numbers in arms, on a certain day, at the grove of\r\nFerentina. And when they assembled from all the states according to the\r\nedict of the Roman king, in order that they should neither have a\r\ngeneral of their own, nor a separate command, or their own standards, he\r\ncompounded companies of Latins and Romans, so as to make one out of two,\r\nand two out of one; the companies being thus doubled, he appointed\r\ncenturions over them.\r\n\r\n53. Nor was Tarquin, though a tyrannical prince in peace, a despicable\r\ngeneral in war; nay, he would have equalled his predecessors in that\r\nart, had not his [62]degeneracy in other respects likewise detracted\r\nfrom his merit here. He began the war against the Volsci, which lasted\r\ntwo hundred years after his time, and took from them Suessa Pometia by\r\nstorm; and when by the sale of the spoils he had amassed forty talents\r\nof silver and of gold, he designed such magnificence for a temple to\r\nJupiter, as should be worthy of the king of gods and men, of the Roman\r\nempire, and of the majesty of the place itself: for the building of this\r\ntemple he set apart the money arising from the spoils. Soon after a war\r\ncame upon him, more tedious than he expected, in which, having in vain\r\nattempted to storm Gabii, a city in his neighbourhood, when being\r\nrepulsed from the walls all hopes of taking it by siege also was taken\r\nfrom him, he assailed it by fraud and stratagem, arts by no means Roman.\r\nFor when, as if the war was laid aside, he pretended to be busily taken\r\nup with laying the foundation of the temple, and with his other works in\r\nthe city, Sextus, the youngest of his three sons, according to concert,\r\nfled to Gabii, complaining of the inhuman cruelty of his father, \"that\r\nhe had turned his tyranny from others against his own family, and was\r\nuneasy at the number of his own children, intending to make the same\r\ndesolations in his own house which he had made in the senate, in order\r\nthat he might leave behind him no issue, nor heir to his kingdom. That\r\nfor his own part, as he had escaped from amidst the swords and other\r\nweapons of his father, he was persuaded he could find no safety any\r\nwhere but among the enemies of L. Tarquin. And, that they might not be\r\nled astray, that the war, which it is now pretended has been given up,\r\nstill lies in reserve, and that he would attack them when off their\r\nguard on the occurrence of an opportunity. But if there be no refuge\r\nfor suppliants among them, that he would traverse all Latium, and would\r\napply to the Volscians, and Æquians, and Hernicians, until he should\r\ncome to those who knew how to protect children from the impious and\r\ncruel persecution of parents. That perhaps he would find some ardour\r\nalso to take up arms and wage war against this proud king and his\r\nhaughty subjects.\" As he seemed a person likely to go further onward,\r\nincensed with anger, if they paid him no regard, he is received by the\r\nGabians very kindly. They bid him not to be surprised, if he were at\r\nlast the same to his children as he had been to his subjects and\r\nallies;--that he would ultimately vent his rage on himself if other\r\nobjects failed him;--that his coming was very acceptable to them, and\r\nthey thought that it would come to pass that by his aid the war would be\r\ntransferred from the gates of Gabii to the walls of Rome.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: _His degeneracy--degeneratum_. This use of the passive\r\nparticiple is of frequent occurrence in Livy.]\r\n\r\n54. Upon this he was admitted into their public councils, where though,\r\nwith regard to other matters, he professed to submit to the judgment of\r\nthe old inhabitants of Gabii, to whom they were better known, yet he\r\nevery now and then advised them to renew the war; to that he pretended\r\nto a superior knowledge, because he was well acquainted with the\r\nstrength of both nations, and knew that the king's pride was decidedly\r\nbecome hateful to his subjects, which not even his own children could\r\nnow endure. As he thus by degrees stirred up the nobles of the Gabians\r\nto renew the war, went himself with the most active of their youth on\r\nplundering parties and expeditions, and ill-grounded credit was attached\r\nto all his words and actions, framed as they were for deception, he is\r\nat length chosen general-in-chief in the war. There when, the people\r\nbeing still ignorant of what was really going on, several skirmishes\r\nwith the Romans took place, wherein the Gabians generally had the\r\nadvantage, then all the Gabians, from the highest to the lowest, were\r\nfirmly persuaded, that Sextus Tarquinius had been sent to them as their\r\ngeneral, by the special favour of the gods. By his exposing himself to\r\nfatigues and dangers, and by his generosity in dividing the plunder, he\r\nwas so beloved by the soldiers, that Tarquin the father had not greater\r\npower at Rome than the son at Gabii. When he saw he had got sufficient\r\nstrength collected to support him in any undertaking, he sent one of\r\nhis confidants to Rome to ask his father what he wished him to do,\r\nseeing the gods had granted him the sole management of all affairs at\r\nGabii. To this courier no answer by word of mouth was given, because, I\r\nsuppose, he appeared of questionable fidelity. The king going into a\r\ngarden of the palace, as it were to consider of the matter, followed by\r\nhis son's messenger; walking there for some time in silence, he is said\r\nto have struck off the heads of the tallest poppies with his staff. The\r\nmessenger, wearied with demanding and waiting for an answer, returned to\r\nGabii as if without having accomplished his object, and told what he had\r\nsaid himself, and what he had observed, adding, \"that Tarquin, either\r\nthrough passion, aversion to him, or his innate pride, had not spoke a\r\nword.\" As soon as it became evident to Sextus what his father wished,\r\nand what conduct he recommended by those silent intimations, he put to\r\ndeath the most eminent men of the city, accusing some of them to the\r\npeople, and others who were exposed by their own unpopularity. Many were\r\nexecuted publicly, and some, against whom an impeachment was likely to\r\nprove less specious, were secretly assassinated. Means of escape were to\r\nsome allowed, and others were banished, and their estates, as well as\r\nthe estates of those who were put to death, publicly distributed. By the\r\nsweets of corruption, plunder, and private advantage resulting from\r\nthese distributions, the sense of the public calamities became\r\nextinguished in them, till the state of Gabii, destitute of counsel and\r\nassistance, was delivered without a struggle into the hands of the Roman\r\nking.\r\n\r\n55. Tarquin, thus put in possession of Gabii, made peace with the\r\nÆquians, and renewed the treaty with the Etrurians. Then he turned his\r\nthoughts to the business of the city. The chief whereof was that of\r\nleaving behind him the temple of Jupiter on the Tarpeian mount, as a\r\nmonument of his name and reign; [since posterity would remember] that of\r\ntwo Tarquinii, both kings, the father had vowed, the son completed it.\r\nAnd that the area, excluding all other forms of worship, might be\r\nentirely appropriated to Jupiter, and his temple, which was to be\r\nerected upon it, he resolved to unhallow several small temples and\r\nchapels, which had been vowed first by king Tatius, in the heat of the\r\nbattle against Romulus, and which he afterwards consecrated and\r\ndedicated. In the very beginning of founding this work it is said that\r\nthe gods exerted their divinity to presage the future greatness of this\r\nempire; for though the birds declared for the unhallowing of all the\r\nother temples, they did not admit of it with respect to that of\r\nTerminus. This omen and augury were taken to import that Terminus's not\r\nchanging his residence, and being the only one of the gods who was not\r\ncalled out of the places devoted to their worship, presaged the duration\r\nand stability of their empire. This being deemed an omen of the\r\nperpetuity, there followed another portending the greatness of the\r\nempire. It is reported that the head of a man, with the face entire,\r\nappeared to the workmen when digging the foundation of the temple. The\r\nsight of this phenomenon unequivocally presaged that this temple should\r\nbe the metropolis of the empire, and the head of the world; and so\r\ndeclared the soothsayers, both those who were in the city, and those\r\nwhom they had sent for from Etruria, to consult on this subject. The\r\nking was encouraged to enlarge the expense; so that the spoils of\r\nPometia, which had been destined to complete the work, scarcely sufficed\r\nfor laying the foundation. On this account I am more inclined to believe\r\nFabius Pictor, besides his being the more ancient historian, that there\r\nwere only forty talents, than Piso, who says that forty thousand pounds\r\nweight of silver were set apart for that purpose; a sum of money neither\r\nto be expected from the spoils of any one city in those times, and one\r\nthat would more than suffice for the foundation of any structure, even\r\nthough exhibiting the magnificence of modern structures.\r\n\r\n56. Tarquin, intent upon finishing this temple, having sent for workmen\r\nfrom all parts of Etruria, employed on it not only the public money, but\r\nthe manual labour of the people; and when this labour, by no means\r\ninconsiderable in itself, was added to their military service, still the\r\npeople murmured less at their building the temples of the gods with\r\ntheir own hands; they were afterwards transferred to other works, which,\r\nwhilst less in show, (required) still greater toil: such as the erecting\r\nbenches in the circus, and conducting under ground the principal\r\nsewer,[63] the receptacle of all the filth of the city; to which two\r\nworks even modern splendour can scarcely produce any thing equal. The\r\npeople having been employed in these works, because he both considered\r\nthat such a multitude was a burden to the city when there was no\r\nemployment for them, and further, he was anxious that the frontiers of\r\nthe empire should be more extensively occupied by sending colonists, he\r\nsent colonists to Signia and Circeii, to serve as defensive barriers\r\nhereafter to the city by land and sea. While he was thus employed a\r\nfrightful prodigy appeared to him. A serpent sliding out of a wooden\r\npillar, after causing dismay and a run into the palace, not so much\r\nstruck the king's heart with sudden terror, as filled him with anxious\r\nsolicitude. Accordingly when Etrurian soothsayers only were employed for\r\npublic prodigies, terrified at this as it were domestic apparition, he\r\ndetermined on sending persons to Delphos to the most celebrated oracle\r\nin the world; and not venturing to intrust the responses of the oracle\r\nto any other person, he despatched his two sons to Greece through lands\r\nunknown at that time, and seas still more so. Titus and Aruns were the\r\ntwo who went. To them were added, as a companion, L. Junius Brutus, the\r\nson of Tarquinia, sister to the king, a youth of an entirely different\r\nquality of mind from that the disguise of which he had assumed. Brutus,\r\non hearing that the chief men of the city, and among others his own\r\nbrother, had been put to death by his uncle, resolved to leave nothing\r\nin his intellects that might be dreaded by the king, nor any thing in\r\nhis fortune to be coveted, and thus to be secure in contempt, where\r\nthere was but little protection in justice. Therefore designedly\r\nfashioning himself to the semblance of foolishness, after he suffered\r\nhimself and his whole estate to become a prey to the king, he did not\r\nrefuse to take even the surname of Brutus, that, concealed under the\r\ncover of such a cognomen, that genius that was to liberate the Roman\r\npeople might await its proper time. He, being brought to Delphos by the\r\nTarquinii rather as a subject of sport than as a companion, is said to\r\nhave brought with him as an offering to Apollo a golden rod, enclosed in\r\na staff of cornel-wood hollowed out for the purpose, a mystical emblem\r\nof his own mind. When they arrived there, their father's commission\r\nbeing executed, a desire seized the young men of inquiring on which of\r\nthem the sovereignty of Rome should devolve. They say that a voice was\r\nreturned from the bottom of the cave, \"Young men, whichever of you shall\r\nfirst kiss his mother shall enjoy the sovereign power at Rome.\" The\r\nTarquinii order the matter to be kept secret with the utmost care, that\r\nSextus, who had been left behind at Rome, might be ignorant of the\r\nresponse, and have no share in the kingdom; they cast lots among\r\nthemselves, as to which of them should first kiss his mother, after they\r\nhad returned to Rome. Brutus, thinking that the Pythian response had\r\nanother meaning, as if he had stumbled and fallen, touched the ground\r\nwith his lips; she being, forsooth, the common mother of all mankind.\r\nAfter this they all returned to Rome, where preparations were being made\r\nwith the greatest vigour for a war against the Rutulians.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: _The principal sewer_--the _cloaca maxima_. This is\r\nattributed to Tarquinius Priscus by several writers. Dio. iii. 67,\r\nstates that it was he who commenced it. See Plin. H. N. xxxvi. Nieb. i.\r\np. 385.]\r\n\r\n57. The Rutulians, a nation very wealthy, considering the country and\r\nage they lived in, were at that time in possession of Ardea. Their\r\nriches gave occasion to the war; for the king of the Romans, being\r\nexhausted of money by the magnificence of his public works, was desirous\r\nboth to enrich himself, and by a large booty to soothe the minds of his\r\nsubjects, who, besides other instances of his tyranny, were incensed\r\nagainst his government, because they were indignant that they had been\r\nkept so long a time by the king in the employments of mechanics, and in\r\nlabour fit for slaves. An attempt was made to take Ardea by storm; when\r\nthat did not succeed, the enemy began to be distressed by a blockade,\r\nand by works raised around them. As it commonly happens in standing\r\ncamps, the war being rather tedious than violent, furloughs were easily\r\nobtained, more so by the officers, however, than the common soldiers.\r\nThe young princes sometimes spent their leisure hours in feasting and\r\nentertainments. One day as they were drinking in the tent of Sextus\r\nTarquin, where Collatinus Tarquinius, the son of Egerius, was also at\r\nsupper, mention was made of wives. Every one commended his own in an\r\nextravagant manner, till a dispute arising about it, Collatinus said,\r\n\"There was no occasion for words, that it might be known in a few hours\r\nhow far his Lucretia excelled all the rest. If then, added he, we have\r\nany share of the vigour of youth, let us mount our horses and examine\r\nthe behaviour of our wives; that must be most satisfactory to every one,\r\nwhich shall meet his eyes on the unexpected arrival of the husband.\"\r\nThey were heated with wine; \"Come on, then,\" say all. They immediately\r\ngalloped to Rome, where they arrived in the dusk of the evening. From\r\nthence they went to Collatia, where they find Lucretia, not like the\r\nking's daughters-in-law, whom they had seen spending their time in\r\nluxurious entertainments with their equals, but though at an advanced\r\ntime of night, employed at her wool, sitting in the middle of the house\r\namid her maids working around her. The merit of the contest regarding\r\nthe ladies was assigned to Lucretia. Her husband on his arrival, and the\r\nTarquinii, were kindly received; the husband, proud of his victory,\r\ngives the young princes a polite invitation. There the villanous passion\r\nfor violating Lucretia by force seizes Sextus Tarquin; both her beauty,\r\nand her approved purity, act as incentives. And then, after this\r\nyouthful frolic of the night, they return to the camp.\r\n\r\n58. A few days after, without the knowledge of Collatinus, Sextus came\r\nto Collatia with one attendant only; where, being kindly received by\r\nthem, as not being aware of his intention, after he had been conducted\r\nafter supper into the guests' chamber, burning with passion, when every\r\nthing around seemed sufficiently secure, and all fast asleep, he comes\r\nto Lucretia, as she lay asleep, with a naked sword, and with his left\r\nhand pressing down the woman's breast, he says, \"Be silent, Lucretia; I\r\nam Sextus Tarquin; I have a sword in my hand; you shall die, if you\r\nutter a word.\" When awaking terrified from sleep, the woman beheld no\r\naid, impending death nigh at hand; then Tarquin acknowledged his\r\npassion, entreated, mixed threats with entreaties, tried the female's\r\nmind in every possible way. When he saw her inflexible, and that she was\r\nnot moved even by the terror of death, he added to terror the threat of\r\ndishonour; he says that he will lay a murdered slave naked by her side\r\nwhen dead, so that she may be said to have been slain in infamous\r\nadultery. When by the terror of this disgrace his lust, as it were\r\nvictorious, had overcome her inflexible chastity, and Tarquin had\r\ndeparted, exulting in having triumphed over a lady's honour, Lucretia,\r\nin melancholy distress at so dreadful a misfortune, despatches the same\r\nmessenger to Rome to her father, and to Ardea to her husband, that they\r\nwould come each with one trusty friend; that it was necessary to do so,\r\nand that quickly.[64] Sp. Lucretius comes with P. Valerius, the son of\r\nVolesus, Collatinus with L. Junius Brutus, with whom, as he was\r\nreturning to Rome, he happened to be met by his wife's messenger. They\r\nfind Lucretia sitting in her chamber in sorrowful dejection. On the\r\narrival of her friends the tears burst from her eyes; and to her\r\nhusband, on his inquiry \"whether all was right,\" she says, \"By no means,\r\nfor what can be right with a woman who has lost her honour? The traces\r\nof another man are on your bed, Collatinus. But the body only has been\r\nviolated, the mind is guiltless; death shall be my witness. But give me\r\nyour right hands, and your honour, that the adulterer shall not come off\r\nunpunished. It is Sextus Tarquin, who, an enemy in the guise of a guest,\r\nhas borne away hence a triumph fatal to me, and to himself, if you are\r\nmen.\" They all pledge their honour; they attempt to console her,\r\ndistracted as she was in mind, by turning away the guilt from her,\r\nconstrained by force, on the perpetrator of the crime; that it is the\r\nmind sins, not the body; and that where intention was wanting guilt\r\ncould not be. \"It is for you to see,\" says she, \"what is due to him. As\r\nfor me, though I acquit myself of guilt, from punishment I do not\r\ndischarge myself; nor shall any woman survive her dishonour pleading the\r\nexample of Lucretia.\" The knife, which she kept concealed beneath her\r\ngarment, she plunges into her heart, and falling forward on the wound,\r\nshe dropped down expiring. The husband and father shriek aloud.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: _To do so, and that quickly_,--a use of the participles\r\n_facto_ and _maturato_ similar to that already noticed in chap. 53,\r\n_degeneratum_.]\r\n\r\n59. Brutus, while they were overpowered with grief, having drawn the\r\nknife out of the wound, and holding it up before him reeking with blood,\r\nsaid, \"By this blood, most pure before the pollution of royal villany, I\r\nswear, and I call you, O gods, to witness my oath, that I shall pursue\r\nLucius Tarquin the Proud, his wicked wife, and all their race, with\r\nfire, sword, and all other means in my power; nor shall I ever suffer\r\nthem or any other to reign at Rome.\" Then he gave the knife to\r\nCollatinus, and after him to Lucretius and Valerius, who were surprised\r\nat such extraordinary mind in the breast of Brutus. However, they all\r\ntake the oath as they were directed, and converting their sorrow into\r\nrage, follow Brutus as their leader, who from that time ceased not to\r\nsolicit them to abolish the regal power. They carry Lucretia's body\r\nfrom her own house, and convey it into the forum; and assemble a number\r\nof persons by the strangeness and atrocity of the extraordinary\r\noccurrence, as usually happens. They complain, each for himself, of the\r\nroyal villany and violence. Both the grief of the father moves them, as\r\nalso Brutus, the reprover of their tears and unavailing complaints, and\r\ntheir adviser to take up arms against those who dared to treat them as\r\nenemies, as would become men and Romans. Each most spirited of the youth\r\nvoluntarily presents himself in arms; the rest of the youth follow also.\r\nFrom thence, after leaving an adequate garrison at the gates at\r\nCollatia, and having appointed sentinels, so that no one might give\r\nintelligence of the disturbance to the king's party, the rest set out\r\nfor Rome in arms under the conduct of Brutus. When they arrived there,\r\nthe armed multitude cause panic and confusion wherever they go. Again,\r\nwhen they see the principal men of the state placing themselves at their\r\nhead, they think that, whatever it may be, it was not without good\r\nreason. Nor does the heinousness of the circumstance excite less violent\r\nemotions at Rome than it had done at Collatia; accordingly they run from\r\nall parts of the city into the forum, whither, when they came, the\r\npublic crier summoned them to attend the tribune of the celeres, with\r\nwhich office Brutus happened to be at that time vested. There an\r\nharangue was delivered by him, by no means of that feeling and capacity\r\nwhich had been counterfeited up to that day, concerning the violence and\r\nlust of Sextus Tarquin, the horrid violation of Lucretia and her\r\nlamentable death, the bereavement of Tricipitinus, to whom the cause of\r\nhis daughter's death was more exasperating and deplorable than the death\r\nitself. To this was added the haughty insolence of the king himself, and\r\nthe sufferings and toils of the people, buried in the earth in cleansing\r\nsinks and sewers; that the Romans, the conquerors of all the surrounding\r\nstates, instead of warriors had become labourers and stone-cutters. The\r\nunnatural murder of king Servius Tullius was dwelt on, and his\r\ndaughter's driving over the body of her father in her impious chariot,\r\nand the gods who avenge parents were invoked by him. By stating these\r\nand other, I suppose, more exasperating circumstances, which though by\r\nno means easily detailed by writers, the heinousness of the case\r\nsuggested at the time, he persuaded the multitude, already incensed, to\r\ndeprive the king of his authority, and to order the banishment of L.\r\nTarquin with his wife and children. He himself, having selected and\r\narmed some of the young men, who readily gave in their names, set out\r\nfor Ardea to the camp to excite the army against the king: the command\r\nin the city he leaves to Lucretius, who had been already appointed\r\nprefect of the city by the king. During this tumult Tullia fled from her\r\nhouse, both men and women cursing her wherever she went, and invoking on\r\nher the furies the avengers of parents.\r\n\r\n60. News of these transactions having reached the camp, when the king,\r\nalarmed at this sudden revolution, was going to Rome to quell the\r\ncommotions, Brutus, for he had notice of his approach, turned out of the\r\nway, that he might not meet him; and much about the same time Brutus and\r\nTarquin arrived by different routes, the one at Ardea, the other at\r\nRome. The gates were shut against Tarquin, and an act of banishment\r\npassed against him; the deliverer of the state the camp received with\r\ngreat joy, and the king's sons were expelled. Two of them followed their\r\nfather, and went into banishment to Cære, a city of Etruria. Sextus\r\nTarquin, having gone to Gabii, as to his own kingdom, was slain by the\r\navengers of the old feuds, which he had raised against himself by his\r\nrapines and murders. Lucius Tarquin the Proud reigned twenty-five years:\r\nthe regal form of government continued from the building of the city to\r\nthis period of its deliverance, two hundred and forty-four years. Two\r\nconsuls, viz. Lucius Junius Brutus and Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus,\r\nwere elected by the prefect of the city at the comitia by centuries,\r\naccording to the commentaries of Servius Tullius.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Brutus binds the people by oath, never to suffer any king to reign\r\n     at Rome, obliges Tarquinius Collatinus, his colleague, to resign\r\n     the consulship, and leave the state; beheads some young noblemen,\r\n     and among the rest his own and his sister's sons, for a conspiracy\r\n     to receive the kings into the city. In a war against the Veientians\r\n     and Tarquiniensians, he engages in single combat with Aruns the son\r\n     of Tarquin the Proud, and expires at the same time with his\r\n     adversary. The ladies mourn for him a whole year. The Capitol\r\n     dedicated. Porsena, king of Clusium, undertakes a war in favour of\r\n     the Tarquins. Bravery of Horatius Cocles, and of Mucius. Porsena\r\n     concludes a peace on the receipt of hostages. Conduct of Clœlia.\r\n     Ap.

Posthumius the\r\n     dictator defeats at the lake Regillus Tarquin the Proud, making war\r\n     upon the Romans with an army of Latins. Secession of the commons to\r\n     the Sacred Mount; brought back by Menenius Agrippa. Five tribunes\r\n     of the people created. Corioli taken by C.

Oppia, a vestal virgin, buried alive for\r\n     incontinence. The Fabian family undertake to carry on that war at\r\n     their own cost and hazard, against the Veientians, and for that\r\n     purpose send out three hundred and six men in arms, who were all\r\n     cut off. Ap. Claudius the consul decimates his army because he had\r\n     been unsuccessful in the war with the Veientians, by their refusing\r\n     to obey orders. An account of the wars with the Volscians, Æquians,\r\n     and Veientians, and the contests of the fathers with the commons._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The affairs, civil and military, of the Roman people, henceforward\r\nfree, their annual magistrates, and the sovereignty of the laws, more\r\npowerful than that of men, I shall now detail.--The haughty insolence of\r\nthe late king had caused this liberty to be the more welcome: for the\r\nformer kings reigned in such a manner that they all in succession might\r\nbe not undeservedly set down as founders of the parts, at least of the\r\ncity, which they added as new residences for the population augmented by\r\nthemselves. Nor is there a doubt but that the very same Brutus who\r\nearned so much glory for expelling this haughty monarch, would have done\r\nso to the greatest injury of the public weal, if, through an over-hasty\r\ndesire of liberty, he had wrested the kingdom from any of the preceding\r\nkings. For what would have been the consequence if that rabble of\r\nshepherds and strangers, fugitives from their own countries, having,\r\nunder the protection of an inviolable asylum, found liberty, or at least\r\nimpunity, uncontrolled by the dread of regal authority, had begun to be\r\ndistracted by tribunician storms, and to engage in contests with the\r\nfathers in a strange city, before the pledges of wives and children, and\r\nlove of the very soil, to which it requires a length of time to become\r\nhabituated, had united their affections. Their affairs not yet matured\r\nwould have been destroyed by discord, which the tranquil moderation of\r\nthe government so cherished, and by proper nourishment brought to such\r\nperfection, that, their strength being now developed, they were able to\r\nproduce the wholesome fruits of liberty. But the origin of liberty you\r\nmay date from this period, rather because the consular authority was\r\nmade annual, than that any diminution was made from the kingly\r\nprerogative. The first consuls had all their privileges and ensigns of\r\nauthority, only care was taken that the terror might not appear doubled,\r\nby both having the fasces at the same time. Brutus was, with the consent\r\nof his colleague, first attended by the fasces, who had not been a more\r\nzealous assertor of liberty than he was afterwards its guardian. First\r\nof all he bound over the people, whilst still enraptured with their\r\nnewly-acquired liberty, by an oath that they would suffer no one to be\r\nking in Rome, lest afterwards they might be perverted by the\r\nimportunities or bribes of the royal family. Next in order, that the\r\nfulness of the house might produce more of strength in the senate, he\r\nfilled up the number of the senators, diminished by the king's murders,\r\nto the amount of three hundred, having elected the principal men of the\r\nequestrian rank; and from thence it is said the custom was derived of\r\nsummoning into the senate both those who were patres and those who were\r\nconscripti.[65] Forsooth they styled those who were elected into the new\r\nsenate Conscripti. It is wonderful how much that contributed to the\r\nconcord of the state, and to attach the affection of the commons to the\r\npatricians.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: All were called _Patres conscripti_. Scil. Patres et\r\nConscripti, the conjunction being omitted. Nieb. i. p. 517.]\r\n\r\n2. Then attention was paid to religious matters, and as some part of the\r\npublic worship had been performed by the kings in person, that they\r\nmight not be missed in any respect, they elect a king of the sacrifices.\r\nThis office they made subject to the pontiff, that honour being added to\r\nthe name might be no infringement on their liberty, which was now their\r\nprincipal care. And I know not whether by fencing it on every side to\r\nexcess, even in the most trivial matters, they may not have exceeded\r\nbounds. For when there was nothing else to offend, the name of one of\r\nthe consuls became an object of dislike to the state. \"That the\r\nTarquinii had been too much habituated to sovereignty; Priscus first\r\ncommenced; that Servius Tullus reigned next; that though an interval\r\nthus intervened, that Tarquinius Superbus, not losing sight of the\r\nkingdom as the property of another, had reclaimed it by crime and\r\nviolence, as the hereditary right of his family. That Superbus being\r\nexpelled, the government was in the hands of Collatinus: that the\r\nTarquinii knew not how to live in a private station; the name pleased\r\nthem not; that it was dangerous to liberty.\"--Such discourses were at\r\nfirst gradually circulated through the entire state by persons sounding\r\ntheir dispositions; and the people, now excited by jealousy, Brutus\r\nconvenes to a meeting. There first of all he recites the people's oath:\r\n\"that they would suffer no one to be king, nor any thing to be in Rome\r\nwhence danger might result to liberty. That it ought to be maintained\r\nwith all their might, and nothing that could tend that way ought to be\r\noverlooked; he said it with reluctance, for the sake of the individual;\r\nand would not say it, did not his affection for the commonwealth\r\npredominate; that the people of Rome do not believe that entire liberty\r\nhas been recovered; that the regal family, the regal name, was not only\r\nin the state but even in the government; that was unfavourable, that was\r\ninjurious to liberty. Do you, L. Tarquinius,\" says he, \"do you, of your\r\nown accord, remove this apprehension. We remember, we own it, you\r\nexpelled the royal family; complete your kindness; take hence the royal\r\nname--your property your fellow citizens shall not only restore you, by\r\nmy advice, but if any thing is wanting they will generously supply.\r\nDepart in amity. Relieve the state from a dread which is perhaps\r\ngroundless. So firmly are they persuaded in mind that only with the\r\nTarquinian race will kingly power depart hence.\" Amazement at so\r\nextraordinary and sudden an occurrence at first impeded the consul's\r\nutterance; then, when he was commencing to speak, the chief men of the\r\nstate stand around him, and by many importunities urge the same request.\r\nOthers indeed had less weight with him. After Sp. Lucretius, superior in\r\nage and rank, his father-in-law besides, began to try various methods,\r\nby entreating and advising alternately, that he would suffer himself to\r\nbe prevailed on by the general feeling of the state, the consul,\r\napprehending lest hereafter these same things might befall him, when\r\nagain in a private station, together with loss of property and other\r\nadditional disgrace, he resigned his consulship; and removing all his\r\neffects to Lavinium, he withdrew from the state.[66] Brutus, according\r\nto a decree of the senate, proposed to the people, that all the family\r\nof the Tarquins should be banished from Rome; and in an assembly by\r\ncenturies he elected P. Valerius, with whose assistance he had expelled\r\nthe kings for his colleague.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: Collatinus is supposed to have earned the odium of the\r\npeople, and his consequent expulsion from Rome, by his endeavours to\r\nsave his nephews, the Aquillii, from punishment.]\r\n\r\n3. Though nobody doubted that a war was impending from the Tarquins, yet\r\nit broke out later than was universally expected; but liberty was well\r\nnigh lost by treachery and fraud, a thing they had never apprehended.\r\nThere were, among the Roman youth, several young men of no mean\r\nfamilies, who, during the regal government, had pursued their pleasures\r\nwithout any restraint; being of the same age with, and companions of,\r\nthe young Tarquins, and accustomed to live in princely style. Longing\r\nfor that licentiousness, now that the privileges of all were equalized,\r\nthey complained that the liberty of others has been converted to their\r\nslavery: \"that a king was a human being, from whom you can obtain, where\r\nright, or where wrong may be necessary; that there was room for favour\r\nand for kindness; that he could be angry, and could forgive; that he\r\nknew the difference between a friend and an enemy; that laws were a\r\ndeaf, inexorable thing, more beneficial and advantageous for the poor\r\nthan the rich; that they allowed of no relaxation or indulgence, if you\r\ntransgress bounds; that it was a perilous state, amid so many human\r\nerrors, to live solely by one's integrity.\" Whilst their minds were\r\nalready thus discontented of their own accord, ambassadors from the\r\nroyal family come unexpectedly, demanding restitution of their effects\r\nmerely, without any mention of return. After their application was heard\r\nin the senate, the deliberation on it lasted for several days, (fearing)\r\nlest the non-restitution might be a pretext for war, and the restitution\r\na fund and assistance for war. In the mean time the ambassadors were\r\nplanning different schemes; openly demanding the property, they secretly\r\nconcerted measures for recovering the throne, and soliciting them as if\r\nfor the object which appeared to be under consideration, they sound\r\ntheir feelings; to those by whom their proposals were favourably\r\nreceived they give letters from the Tarquins, and confer with them about\r\nadmitting the royal family into the city secretly by night.\r\n\r\n4. The matter was first intrusted to brothers of the name of Vitellii\r\nand those of the name of Aquilii. A sister of the Vitellii had been\r\nmarried to Brutus the consul, and the issue of that marriage were young\r\nmen, Titus and Tiberius; these also their uncles admit into a\r\nparticipation of the plot: several young noblemen also were taken in as\r\nassociates, the memory of whose names has been lost from distance of\r\ntime. In the mean time, when that opinion had prevailed in the senate,\r\nwhich recommended the giving back of the property, and the ambassadors\r\nmade use of this as a pretext for delay in the city, because they had\r\nobtained from the consuls time to procure modes of conveyance, by which\r\nthey might convey away the effects of the royal family; all this time\r\nthey spend in consulting with the conspirators, and by pressing they\r\nsucceed in having letters given to them for the Tarquins. For otherwise\r\nhow were they to believe that the accounts brought by the ambassadors on\r\nmatters of such importance were not idle? The letters, given to be a\r\npledge of their sincerity, discovered the plot; for when, the day before\r\nthe ambassadors set out to the Tarquins, they had supped by chance at\r\nthe house of the Vitellii, and the conspirators there in private\r\ndiscoursed much together concerning their new design, as is natural, one\r\nof the slaves, who had already perceived what was going on, overheard\r\ntheir conversation; but waited for the occasion when the letters should\r\nbe given to the ambassadors, the detection of which would prove the\r\ntransaction; when he perceived that they were given, he laid the whole\r\naffair before the consuls. The consuls, having left their home to seize\r\nthe ambassadors and conspirators, crushed the whole affair without any\r\ntumult; particular care being taken of the letters, lest they should\r\nescape them. The traitors being immediately thrown into chains, a little\r\ndoubt was entertained respecting the ambassadors, and though they\r\ndeserved to be considered as enemies, the law of nations however\r\nprevailed.\r\n\r\n5. The question concerning the restitution of the tyrants' effects,\r\nwhich the senate had formerly voted, came again under consideration. The\r\nfathers, fired with indignation, expressly forbad them either to be\r\nrestored or confiscated. They were given to be rifled by the people,\r\nthat after being made participators in the royal plunder, they might\r\nlose for ever all hopes of a reconciliation with the Tarquins. A field\r\nbelonging to them, which lay between the city and the Tiber, having been\r\nconsecrated to Mars, has been called the Campus Martius. It happened\r\nthat there was a crop of corn upon it ready to be cut down, which\r\nproduce of the field, as they thought it unlawful to use, after it was\r\nreaped, a great number of men carried the corn and straw in baskets, and\r\nthrew them into the Tiber, which then flowed with shallow water, as is\r\nusual in the heat of summer; that thus the heaps of corn as it stuck in\r\nthe shallows became settled when covered over with mud: by these and the\r\nafflux of other things, which the river happened to bring thither, an\r\nisland was formed by degrees. Afterwards I believe that mounds were\r\nadded, and that aid was afforded by art, that a surface so well raised\r\nmight be firm enough for sustaining temples and porticoes. After\r\nplundering the tyrants' effects, the traitors were condemned and capital\r\npunishment inflicted. Their punishment was the more remarkable, because\r\nthe consulship imposed on the father the office of punishing his own\r\nchildren, and him who should have been removed as a spectator, fortune\r\nassigned as the person to exact the punishment. Young men of the highest\r\nquality stood tied to a stake; but the consul's sons attracted the eyes\r\nof all the spectators from the rest of the criminals, as from persons\r\nunknown; nor did the people pity them more on account of the severity of\r\nthe punishment, than the horrid crime by which they had deserved it.\r\n\"That they, in that year particularly, should have brought themselves to\r\nbetray into the hands of Tarquin, formerly a proud tyrant, and now an\r\nexasperated exile, their country just delivered, their father its\r\ndeliverer, the consulate which took its rise from the family of the\r\nJunii, the fathers, the people, and whatever belonged either to the gods\r\nor the citizens of Rome.\"[67] The consuls seated themselves in their\r\ntribunal, and the lictors, being despatched to inflict punishment, strip\r\nthem naked, beat them with rods, and strike off their heads. Whilst\r\nduring all this time, the father, his looks and his countenance,\r\npresented a touching spectacle,[68] the feelings of the father bursting\r\nforth occasionally during the office of superintending the public\r\nexecution. Next after the punishment of the guilty, that there might be\r\na striking example in either way for the prevention of crime, a sum of\r\nmoney was granted out of the treasury as a reward to the discoverer;\r\nliberty also and the rights of citizenship were granted him. He is said\r\nto have been the first person made free by the Vindicta; some think even\r\nthat the term vindicta is derived from him. After him it was observed as\r\na rule, that those who were set free in this manner were supposed to be\r\nadmitted to the rights of Roman citizens.[69]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: Niebuhr will have it that Brutus punished his children by\r\nhis authority as a father, and that there was no appeal to the people\r\nfrom the father. See Nieb. i. p. 488.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: _Animo patris_, the strength of his mind, though that of a\r\nfather, being even more conspicuous, &c. So Drakenborch understands the\r\npassage,--this sternness of mind, he says, though he was their father,\r\nwas a more remarkable spectacle than his stern countenance. This\r\ncharacter of Brutus, as inferrible from the words thus interpreted,\r\ncoincides with that given of him by Dionysius and others. I prefer\r\nunderstanding the passage with Crevier, scil. symptoms of paternal\r\naffection to his children displaying themselves during the discharge of\r\nhis duty in superintending the public punishment inflicted on them.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: Previously, by the institution of Servius, only such\r\nmanumitted slaves were admitted to the rights of citizenship as were\r\nregistered by their masters in the census.]\r\n\r\n6. On these things being announced to him, as they had occurred,\r\nTarquin, inflamed not only with grief for the frustration of such great\r\nhopes, but with hatred and resentment also, when he saw that the way was\r\nblocked up against stratagem, considering that he should have recourse\r\nto war openly, went round as a suppliant to the cities of Etruria,\r\n\"that they should not suffer him, sprung from themselves, of the same\r\nblood, exiled and in want, lately in possession of so great a kingdom,\r\nto perish before their eyes, with the young men his sons. That others\r\nhad been invited to Rome from foreign lands to the throne; that he, a\r\nking, extending the Roman empire by his arms, was driven out by those\r\nnearest to him by a villanous conspiracy; that they had by violence\r\ndivided the parts among themselves, because no one individual among them\r\nwas deemed sufficiently deserving of the kingdom; that they had given up\r\nhis effects to the people to be pillaged by them, that no one might be\r\nfree from that guilt. That he was desirous to recover his country and\r\nhis kingdom, and to punish his ungrateful subjects. That they should\r\nbring succour and aid him; that they might also revenge the injuries\r\ndone to them of old, their legions so often slaughtered, their land\r\ntaken from them.\" These arguments prevailed on the people of Veii, and\r\nwith menaces they declare that now at least, under the conduct of a\r\nRoman general, their former disgrace should be wiped off, and what they\r\nhad lost in war should be recovered. His name and relation to them\r\ninduced the people of Tarquinii to take part with him; it seemed an\r\nhonour that their countrymen should reign at Rome. Therefore the two\r\narmies of these two states followed Tarquin in order to recover his\r\nkingdom, and to take vengeance upon the Romans. When they entered the\r\nRoman territories, the consuls marched to meet them. Valerius led up the\r\nfoot in a square battalion, and Brutus marched before with his horse to\r\nreconnoitre (the enemy). Their cavalry likewise came up first; Aruns,\r\nTarquin's son, commanded it; the king himself followed with the legions.\r\nAruns, when he knew at a distance by the lictors that it was a consul,\r\nand on coming nigher discovered for certain that it was Brutus by his\r\nface, all inflamed with rage, he cried out, \"There is the villain who\r\nhas banished us from our native country! see how he rides in state\r\nadorned with the ensigns of our dignity! now assist me, gods, the\r\navengers of kings.\" He put spurs to his horse and drove furiously\r\nagainst the consul. Brutus perceived the attack made on him; as it was\r\nhonourable in these days for the generals to engage in combat, he\r\neagerly offered himself to the combat. They encountered one another with\r\nsuch furious animosity, neither mindful of protecting his own person,\r\nprovided he could wound his adversary; so that both, transfixed through\r\nthe buckler by the blow from the opposite direction, fell lifeless from\r\ntheir horses, entangled together by the two spears. The engagement\r\nbetween the rest of the horse commenced at the same time, and soon after\r\nthe foot came up. There they fought with doubtful success, and as it\r\nwere with equal advantage, and the victory doubtful. The right wings of\r\nboth armies were victorious and the left worsted. The Veientians,\r\naccustomed to be discomfited by the Roman soldiers, were routed and put\r\nto flight. The Tarquinienses, who were a new enemy, not only stood their\r\nground, but even on their side obliged the Romans to give way.\r\n\r\n7. After the issue of this battle, so great a terror seized Tarquin and\r\nthe Etrurians, that both the armies, the Veientian and Tarquinian,\r\ngiving up the matter as impracticable, departed to their respective\r\nhomes. They annex strange incidents to this battle,--that in the silence\r\nof the next night a loud voice was emitted from the Arsian wood; that it\r\nwas believed to be the voice of Silvanus: these words were spoken, \"that\r\nmore of the Etrurians by one[70] had fallen in the battle; that the\r\nRoman was victorious in the war.\" Certainly the Romans departed thence\r\nas victors, the Etrurians as vanquished. For as soon as it was light,\r\nand not one of the enemy was now to be seen, P. Valerius the consul\r\ncollected the spoils, and returned thence in triumph to Rome. His\r\ncolleague's funeral he celebrated with all the magnificence then\r\npossible. But a far greater honour to his death was the public sorrow,\r\nsingularly remarkable in this particular, that the matrons mourned him a\r\nyear,[71] as a parent, because he had been so vigorous an avenger of\r\nviolated chastity. Afterwards the consul who survived, so changeable are\r\nthe minds of the people, from great popularity, encountered not only\r\njealousy, but suspicion, originating in an atrocious charge. Report\r\nrepresented that he aspired to the crown, because he had not substituted\r\na colleague in the room of Brutus, and was building a house on the\r\nsummit of Mount Velia, that there would be there an impregnable fortress\r\non an elevated and well-fortified place. When these things, thus\r\ncirculated and believed, affected the consul's mind with indignation,\r\nhaving summoned the people to an assembly, he mounts the rostrum, after\r\nlowering the fasces. It was a grateful sight to the multitude that the\r\ninsignia of authority were lowered to them, and that an acknowledgment\r\nwas made, that the majesty and power of the people were greater than\r\nthat of the consul. When they were called to silence, Valerius highly\r\nextolled the good fortune of his colleague, \"who after delivering his\r\ncountry had died vested with the supreme power, fighting bravely in\r\ndefence of the commonwealth, when his glory was in its maturity, and not\r\nyet converted into jealousy. That he himself, having survived his glory,\r\nnow remained as an object of accusation and calumny; that from the\r\nliberator of his country he had fallen to the level of the Aquilii and\r\nVitellii. Will no merit then, says he, ever be so tried and approved by\r\nyou, as to be exempted from the attacks of suspicion. Could I apprehend\r\nthat myself, the bitterest enemy of kings, should fall under the charge\r\nof a desire of royalty? Could I believe that, even though I dwelt in the\r\nvery citadel and the Capitol, that I could be dreaded by my fellow\r\ncitizens? Does my character among you depend on so mere a trifle? Is my\r\nintegrity so slightly founded, that it makes more matter where I may be,\r\nthan what I may be. The house of Publius Valerius shall not stand in the\r\nway of your liberty, Romans; the Velian mount shall be secure to you. I\r\nwill not only bring down my house into the plain, but I will build it\r\nbeneath the hill, that you may dwell above me a suspected citizen. Let\r\nthose build on the Velian mount to whom liberty is more securely\r\nintrusted than to P. Valerius.\" Immediately all the materials were\r\nbrought down to the foot of the Velian mount, and the house was built at\r\nthe foot of the hill where the temple of Victory now stands.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: _Uno plus Tuscorum._ ?? ??? p?e???? ?? t? µ??? te????as?\r\n???????? ? ??µa???.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: _A year_, scil. of ten months.]\r\n\r\n8. After this laws were passed, which not only cleared him of all\r\nsuspicions of aiming at the regal power, but had so contrary a tendency,\r\nthat they made him popular. From thence he was surnamed Poplicola. Above\r\nall, the laws regarding an appeal to the people against the magistrates,\r\nand that devoting the life and property of any one who should form a\r\ndesign of assuming regal authority, were grateful to the people. And\r\nafter he had passed these while sole consul, so that the merit in them\r\nwas exclusively his own, he then held an assembly for the election of a\r\nnew colleague. Sp. Lucretius was elected consul, who being very old, and\r\nhis strength being inadequate to discharge the consular duties, dies in\r\na few days. M. Horatius Pulvillus was substituted in the room of\r\nLucretius. In some old writers I find no mention of Lucretius as consul;\r\nthey place Horatius immediately after Brutus. I believe that, because no\r\nimportant event signalized his consulate, it has been unnoticed.\r\nJupiter's temple in the Capitol had not yet been dedicated; the consuls\r\nValerius and Horatius cast lots which should dedicate it. It fell by lot\r\nto Horatius. Publicola departed to the war of the Veientians. The\r\nfriends of Valerius were more annoyed than they should have been, that\r\nthe dedication of so celebrated a temple should be given to\r\nHoratius.[72] Having endeavoured by every means to prevent that, when\r\nall other attempts had been tried in vain, when the consul was now\r\nholding the door-post during his offering of prayer to the gods, they\r\nsuddenly announce to him the shocking intelligence that his son was\r\ndead, and that his family being defiled[73] he could not dedicate the\r\ntemple. Whether he did not believe the fact, or possessed such great\r\nfirmness of mind, is neither handed down for certain, nor is a\r\nconjecture easy. Diverted from his purpose at this intelligence in no\r\nother way than to order that the body should be buried,[74] he goes\r\nthrough the prayer, and dedicates the temple. These were the\r\ntransactions at home and abroad the first year after the expulsion of\r\nthe kings. After this P. Valerius, a second time, and Titus Lucretius,\r\nwere elected consuls.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: The Horatii being of the _minores patres_. Nieb. i. p.\r\n533.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: _Funesta familia_, as having in it an unburied corpse.\r\nThus Misenus, whilst unburied, _incestat funere classem_. Virg. Æn. vi.\r\n150.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: He here rejected the omen. Cic. i. 7, 14.; auguria aut\r\n_oblativa_ sunt, quæ non poscuntur, aut _impetrativa_, quæ optata\r\nveniunt. The latter could not be rejected.]\r\n\r\n9. By this time the Tarquins had fled to Lars[75] Porsena, king of\r\nClusium. There, mixing advice with their entreaties, \"They sometimes\r\nbesought him not to suffer them, who were descended from the Etrurians,\r\nand of the same blood and name, to live in exile and poverty; at other\r\ntimes they advised him not to let this commencing practice of expelling\r\nkings pass unpunished. That liberty has charms enough in itself; and\r\nunless kings defend their crowns with as much vigour as the people\r\npursue their liberty, that the highest must be reduced to a level with\r\nthe lowest; there will be nothing exalted, nothing distinguished above\r\nthe rest; and hence there must be an end of regal government, the most\r\nbeautiful institution both among gods and men.\" Porsena, thinking that\r\nit would be an honour to the Tuscans both that there should be a king at\r\nRome, and especially one of the Etrurian nation, marched towards Rome\r\nwith a hostile army. Never before on any other occasion did so great\r\nterror seize the senate; so powerful was the state of Clusium at the\r\ntime, and so great the renown of Porsena. Nor did they only dread their\r\nenemies, but even their own citizens, lest the common people, through\r\nexcess of fear, should, by receiving the Tarquins into the city, accept\r\npeace even if purchased with slavery. Many conciliatory concessions were\r\ntherefore granted to the people by the senate during that period. Their\r\nattention, in the first place, was directed to the markets, and persons\r\nwere sent, some to the Volscians, others to Cumæ, to buy up corn. The\r\nprivilege[76] of selling salt, also, because it was farmed at a high\r\nrent, was all taken into the hands of government,[77] and withdrawn from\r\nprivate individuals; and the people were freed from port-duties and\r\ntaxes; that the rich, who were adequate to bearing the burden, should\r\ncontribute; that the poor paid tax enough if they educated their\r\nchildren. This indulgent care of the fathers accordingly kept the whole\r\nstate in such concord amid the subsequent severities in the siege and\r\nfamine, that the highest abhorred the name of king not more than the\r\nlowest; nor was any single individual afterwards so popular by\r\nintriguing practices, as the whole senate then was by their excellent\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: _Lar_. This is generally understood to have been a title\r\nof honour equivalent to our term _Lord_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: _Arbitrium_ signifies not only the \"privilege,\" but the\r\n\"rent\" paid for such privilege, or right of monopoly.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: _Was all taken into the hands of government_. In my\r\nversion of this passage I have conformed to the emendation of the\r\noriginal first proposed by Gronovius, and admitted by Stroth and Bekker;\r\nscil. _in publicum omne sumptum_.--They did not let these salt-works by\r\nauction, but took them into their own management, and carried them on by\r\nmeans of persons employed to work on the public account. These\r\nsalt-works, first established at Ostia by Ancus, were, like other public\r\nproperty, farmed out to the publicans. As they had a high rent to pay,\r\nthe price of salt was raised in proportion; but now the patricians, to\r\ncurry favour with the plebeians, did not let the salt-pits to private\r\ntenants, but kept them in the hands of public labourers, to collect all\r\nthe salt for the public use; and appointed salesmen to retail it to the\r\npeople at a cheaper rate. See Stocker's ed.]\r\n\r\n10. Some parts seemed secured by the walls, others by the interposition\r\nof the Tiber. The Sublician bridge well nigh afforded a passage to the\r\nenemy, had there not been one man, Horatius Cocles, (that defence the\r\nfortune of Rome had on that day,) who, happening to be posted on guard\r\nat the bridge, when he saw the Janiculum taken by a sudden assault, and\r\nthat the enemy were pouring down from thence in full speed, and that his\r\nown party, in terror and confusion, were abandoning their arms and\r\nranks, laying hold of them one by one, standing in their way, and\r\nappealing to the faith of gods and men, he declared, \"That their flight\r\nwould avail them nothing if they deserted their post; if they passed the\r\nbridge and left it behind them, there would soon be more of the enemy in\r\nthe Palatium and Capitol than in the Janiculum; for that reason he\r\nadvised and charged them to demolish the bridge, by their sword, by\r\nfire, or by any means whatever; that he would stand the shock of the\r\nenemy as far as could be done by one man.\" He then advances to the first\r\nentrance of the bridge, and being easily distinguished among those who\r\nshowed their backs in retreating from the fight, facing about to engage\r\nthe foe hand to hand, by his surprising bravery he terrified the enemy.\r\nTwo indeed a sense of shame kept with him, Sp. Lartius and T. Herminius,\r\nmen eminent for their birth, and renowned for their gallant exploits.\r\nWith them he for a short time stood the first storm of the danger, and\r\nthe severest brunt of the battle. But as they who demolished the bridge\r\ncalled upon them to retire, he obliged them also to withdraw to a place\r\nof safety on a small portion of the bridge still left. Then casting his\r\nstern eyes round all the officers of the Etrurians in a threatening\r\nmanner, he sometimes challenged them singly, sometimes reproached them\r\nall; \"the slaves of haughty tyrants, who, regardless of their own\r\nfreedom, came to oppress the liberty of others.\" They hesitated for a\r\nconsiderable time, looking round one at the other, to commence the\r\nfight; shame then put the army in motion, and a shout being raised, they\r\nhurl their weapons from all sides on their single adversary; and when\r\nthey all stuck in the shield held before him, and he with no less\r\nobstinacy kept possession of the bridge with firm step, they now\r\nendeavoured to thrust him down from it by one push, when at once the\r\ncrash of the falling bridge, at the same time a shout of the Romans\r\nraised for joy at having completed their purpose, checked their ardour\r\nwith sudden panic. Then Cocles says, \"Holy father Tiberinus, I pray that\r\nthou wouldst receive these arms, and this thy soldier, in thy propitious\r\nstream.\" Armed as he was, he leaped into the Tiber, and amid showers of\r\ndarts hurled on him, swam across safe to his party, having dared an act\r\nwhich is likely to obtain more fame than credit with posterity. The\r\nstate was grateful towards such valour; a statue was erected to him in\r\nthe comitium, and as much land was given to him as he ploughed around in\r\none day. The zeal of private individuals also was conspicuous among the\r\npublic honours. For, amid the great scarcity, each person contributed\r\nsomething to him according to his supply at home, depriving himself of\r\nhis own support.\r\n\r\n11. Porsena being repulsed in his first attempt, having changed his\r\nplans from a siege to a blockade, after he had placed a garrison in\r\nJaniculum, pitched his camp in the plain and on the banks of the Tiber.\r\nThen sending for boats from all parts, both to guard the river, so as\r\nnot to suffer any provision to be conveyed to Rome, and also to\r\ntransport his soldiers across the river, to plunder different places as\r\noccasion required; in a short time he so harassed the entire country\r\nround Rome, that not only every thing else from the country, but even\r\ntheir cattle, was driven into the city, and nobody durst venture thence\r\nwithout the gates. This liberty of action was granted to the Etrurians,\r\nnot more through fear than from policy; for Valerius, intent on an\r\nopportunity of falling unawares upon a number of them, and when\r\nstraggling, a remiss avenger in trifling matters, reserved the weight of\r\nhis vengeance for more important occasions. Wherefore, to decoy the\r\npillagers, he ordered his men to drive their cattle the next day out at\r\nthe Esquiline gate, which was farthest from the enemy, presuming that\r\nthey would get intelligence of it, because during the blockade and\r\nfamine some slaves would turn traitors and desert. Accordingly they were\r\ninformed of it by a deserter, and parties more numerous than usual, in\r\nhopes of seizing the entire body, crossed the river. Then P. Valerius\r\ncommanded T. Herminius, with a small body of men, to lie concealed two\r\nmiles from the city, on the Gabian road, and Sp. Lartius, with a party\r\nof light-armed troops, to post himself at the Colline gate till the\r\nenemy should pass by, and then to throw himself in their way so that\r\nthere may be no return to the river. The other consul, T. Lucretius,\r\nmarched out of the Nævian gate with some companies of soldiers; Valerius\r\nhimself led some chosen cohorts down from the Cœlian mount, and they\r\nwere first descried by the enemy. Herminius, when he perceived the\r\nalarm, rose out of the ambush and fell upon the rear of the Tuscans, who\r\nhad charged Valerius. The shout was returned on the right and left, from\r\nthe Colline gate on the one hand, and the Nævian on the other. By this\r\nstratagem the plunderers were put to the sword between both, they not\r\nbeing a match in strength for fighting, and all the ways being blocked\r\nup to prevent escape: this put an end to the Etrurians strolling about\r\nin so disorderly a manner.\r\n\r\n12. Nevertheless the blockade continued, and there was a scarcity of\r\ncorn, with a very high price. Porsena entertained a hope that by\r\ncontinuing the siege he should take the city, when C. Mucius, a young\r\nnobleman, to whom it seemed a disgrace that the Roman people, when\r\nenslaved under kings, had never been confined within their walls in any\r\nwar, nor by any enemy, should now when a free people be blocked up by\r\nthese very Etrurians whose armies they had often routed, thinking that\r\nsuch indignity should be avenged by some great and daring effort, at\r\nfirst designed of his own accord to penetrate into the enemy's camp.\r\nThen, being afraid if he went without the permission of the consuls, or\r\nthe knowledge of any one, he might be seized by the Roman guards and\r\nbrought back as a deserter, the circumstances of the city at the time\r\njustifying the charge, he went to the senate: \"Fathers,\" says he, \"I\r\nintend to cross the Tiber, and enter the enemy's camp, if I can; not as\r\na plunderer, or as an avenger in our turn of their devastations. A\r\ngreater deed is in in my mind, if the gods assist.\" The senate approved\r\nhis design. He set out with a sword concealed under his garment. When he\r\ncame thither, he stationed himself among the thickest of the crowd, near\r\nthe king's tribunal. There, when the soldiers were receiving their pay,\r\nand the king's secretary sitting by him, dressed nearly in the same\r\nstyle, was busily engaged, and to him they commonly addressed\r\nthemselves, being afraid to ask which of them was Porsena, lest by not\r\nknowing the king he should discover on himself, as fortune blindly\r\ndirected the blow, he killed the secretary instead of the king. When, as\r\nhe was going off thence where with his bloody dagger he had made his way\r\nthrough the dismayed multitude, a concourse being attracted at the\r\nnoise, the king's guards immediately seized and brought him back\r\nstanding alone before the king's tribunal; even then, amid such menaces\r\nof fortune, more capable of inspiring dread than of feeling it, \"I am,\"\r\nsays he, \"a Roman citizen, my name is Caius Mucius; an enemy, I wished\r\nto slay an enemy, nor have I less of resolution to suffer death than I\r\nhad to inflict it. Both to act and to suffer with fortitude is a Roman's\r\npart. Nor have I alone harboured such feelings towards you; there is\r\nafter me a long train of persons aspiring to the same honour. Therefore,\r\nif you choose it, prepare yourself for this peril, to contend for your\r\nlife every hour; to have the sword and the enemy in the very entrance of\r\nyour pavilion; this is the war which we the Roman youth declare against\r\nyou; dread not an army in array, nor a battle; the affair will be to\r\nyourself alone and with each of us singly.\" When the king, highly\r\nincensed, and at the same time terrified at the danger, in a menacing\r\nmanner, commanded fires to be kindled about him, if he did not speedily\r\nexplain the plots, which, by his threats, he had darkly insinuated\r\nagainst him; Mucius said, \"Behold me, that you may be sensible of how\r\nlittle account the body is to those who have great glory in view;\" and\r\nimmediately he thrusts his right hand into the fire that was lighted for\r\nthe sacrifice. When he continued to broil it as if he had been quite\r\ninsensible, the king, astonished at this surprising sight, after he had\r\nleaped from his throne and commanded the young man to be removed from\r\nthe altar, says, \"Be gone, having acted more like an enemy towards\r\nthyself than me. I would encourage thee to persevere in thy valour, if\r\nthat valour stood on the side of my country. I now dismiss you untouched\r\nand unhurt, exempted from the right of war.\" Then Mucius, as if making a\r\nreturn for the kindness, says, \"Since bravery is honoured by you, so\r\nthat you have obtained by kindness that which you could not by threats,\r\nthree hundred of us, the chief of the Roman youth, have conspired to\r\nattack you in this manner. It was my lot first. The rest will follow,\r\neach in his turn, according as the lot shall set him forward, unless\r\nfortune shall afford an opportunity of you.\"\r\n\r\n13. Mucius being dismissed, to whom the cognomen of Scævola was\r\nafterwards given, from the loss of his right hand, ambassadors from\r\nPorsena followed him to Rome. The risk of the first attempt, from which\r\nnothing had saved him but the mistake of the assailant, and the risk to\r\nbe encountered so often in proportion to the number of conspirators,\r\nmade so strong an impression upon him, that of his own accord he made\r\npropositions of peace to the Romans. Mention was made to no purpose\r\nregarding the restoration of the Tarquinii to the throne, rather because\r\nhe had been unable to refuse that to the Tarquinii, than from not\r\nknowing that it would be refused to him by the Romans. The condition of\r\nrestoring their territory to the Veientians was obtained by him, and the\r\nnecessity of giving hostages in case they wished the garrison to be\r\nwithdrawn from the Janiculum was extorted from the Romans. Peace being\r\nconcluded on these terms, Porsena drew his troops out of the Janiculum,\r\nand marched out of the Roman territories. The fathers gave Mucius, as a\r\nreward of his valour, lands on the other side of the Tiber, which were\r\nafterwards called the Mucian meadows. By this honour paid to valour the\r\nwomen were excited to merit public distinctions. As the camp of the\r\nEtrurians had been pitched not far from the banks of the Tiber, a young\r\nlady named Clælia, one of the hostages, deceiving her keepers, swam over\r\nthe river, amidst the darts of the enemy, at the head of a troop of\r\nvirgins, and brought them all safe to their relations. When the king was\r\ninformed of this, at first highly incensed, he sent deputies to Rome to\r\ndemand the hostage Clælia; that he did not regard the others; and\r\nafterwards, being changed into admiration of her courage, he said, \"that\r\nthis action surpassed those of Cocles and Mucius,\" and declared, \"as he\r\nwould consider the treaty as broken if the hostage were not delivered\r\nup, so, if given up, he would send her back safe to her friends.\" Both\r\nsides kept their faith: the Romans restored their pledge of peace\r\naccording to treaty; and with the king of Etruria merit found not only\r\nsecurity, but honour; and, after making encomiums on the young lady,\r\npromised to give her, as a present, half of the hostages, and that she\r\nshould choose whom she pleased. When they were all brought out, she is\r\nsaid to have pitched upon the young boys below puberty, which was both\r\nconsonant to maiden delicacy, and by consent of the hostages themselves\r\nit was deemed reasonable, that that age which was most exposed to injury\r\nshould be freed from the enemy's hand. The peace being re-established,\r\nthe Romans marked the uncommon instance of bravery in the woman, by an\r\nuncommon kind of honour, an equestrian statue; (the statue representing)\r\na lady sitting on horseback was placed at the top of the Via Sacra.\r\n\r\n14. Inconsistent with this so peaceful a departure of the Etrurian king\r\nfrom the city, is the custom handed down from the ancients, and which\r\ncontinues down to our times among other usages at public sales, (I mean)\r\nthat of selling the goods of king Porsena; the origin[78] of which\r\ncustom must either have occurred during the war, and was not\r\nrelinquished in peace, or it must have increased from a milder source\r\nthan the form of expression imports, of selling the goods in a hostile\r\nmanner. Of the accounts handed down, the most probable is, that Porsena,\r\non retiring from the Janiculum, made a present to the Romans of his camp\r\nwell stored with provisions conveyed from the neighbouring and fertile\r\nfields of Etruria, the city being then exhausted by the long siege; that\r\nthis, lest it should be carried away in a hostile manner, by the people\r\nbeing admitted in, was then sold, and called the goods of Porsena, the\r\nexpression rather importing gratitude for the gift, than an auction of\r\nthe king's property, which never even was in the power of the Roman\r\npeople. Porsena, after ending the Roman war, that his army might not\r\nseem to have been led into these parts without effecting any thing, sent\r\nhis son Aruns with a part of his forces to besiege Aricia. The matter\r\nnot being expected, the Aricians were at first terrified; afterwards\r\nassistance, which was sent for from the people of Latium and Cumæ,\r\ninspired so much hope, that they ventured to meet them in the field. At\r\nthe commencement of the battle the Etrurians attacked the Aricians so\r\nfuriously, that they routed them at the first onset. But the Cuman\r\ncohorts, opposing stratagem to force, moved off a little to one side,\r\nand when the enemy were carried beyond them in great disorder, they\r\nfaced about and charged them in the rear. By this means the Etrurians,\r\nwhen they had almost got the victory, were enclosed and cut to\r\npieces.[79] A very small part of them, having lost their general,\r\nbecause they had no nearer refuge, came to Rome without their arms, in\r\nthe condition and with the air of suppliants. There they were kindly\r\nreceived and provided with lodgings. When their wounds were cured, many\r\nof them went home and told the kind hospitality they had met with.\r\nAffection for their hosts and for the city detained many at Rome; a\r\nplace was assigned them to dwell in, which they have ever since called\r\nthe Tuscan Street.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: _The origin_. Niebuhr mentions a more probable one. See\r\nNieb. i. p. 541; ii. p. 204.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: Niebuhr thinks, that from this defeat of the Etrurians may\r\nbe dated the commencement of the recovery of their liberty by the\r\nRomans, and that the flight of the Roman hostages, the sale of Porsena's\r\ngoods, &c. were subsequent to it.]\r\n\r\n15. Then P. Lucretius and P. Valerius Publicola were elected consuls.\r\nThis year ambassadors came from Porsena for the last time, regarding the\r\nrestoration of Tarquin to the throne. And when they were answered, that\r\nthe senate would send deputies to the king; some of the principal\r\npersons of that order were forthwith despatched to represent to him\r\n\"that it was not because the answer could not have been given in a few\r\nwords, that the royal family would not be received, that select members\r\nof the senate had been deputed to him, rather than an answer given to\r\nhis ambassadors at Rome; but (it was done) that all mention of the\r\nmatter might be put an end to for evermore, and that their minds might\r\nnot be disturbed amid so many mutual acts of kindness, by his requiring\r\nwhat was adverse to the liberty of the Roman people, and by their\r\ndenying to him to whom they would willingly deny nothing, unless they\r\nwould submit to their own ruin. That the Roman people were not now under\r\na kingly government, but in a state of freedom, and were firmly\r\ndetermined rather to open their gates to enemies than to kings. That it\r\nwas the wish of all, that their city might have the same period of\r\nexistence as their freedom in that city. Wherefore, if he wished Rome to\r\nbe safe, they entreated that he would suffer it to be free.\" The king,\r\novercome by modesty, says, \"Since it is your firm and fixed resolve, I\r\nwill neither tease you by repeatedly urging these same subjects more\r\nfrequently, nor will I disappoint the Tarquinii by holding out hopes of\r\naid which it is not in my power to give them; whether they have need of\r\npeace, or of war, let them seek another place from here for their exile,\r\nthat nothing may disturb the peace between you and me.\" To these kind\r\npromises he added actions still more friendly, for he delivered up the\r\nremainder of the hostages, and restored to them the land of the\r\nVeientians, which had been taken from them by the treaty concluded at\r\nJaniculum. Tarquin, all hopes of return being now cut off, went to\r\nTusculum to live in exile with his son-in-law Mamilius Octavius. Thus\r\nthe peace between Porsena and the Romans was inviolably preserved.\r\n\r\n16. M. Valerius and P. Posthumius were chosen consuls. This year war was\r\ncarried on successfully against the Sabines; the consuls received the\r\nhonour of a triumph. Upon this the Sabines made preparations for war on\r\na larger scale. To make head against them, and lest any sudden danger\r\nmight arise from Tusculum, (whence they suspected a war, though it was\r\nnot yet declared,) P. Valerius was created consul a fourth time, and T.\r\nLucretius a second time. A disturbance arising among the Sabines,\r\nbetween the advisers of war and of peace, transferred from thence some\r\nadditional strength to the Romans. For Attus Clausus, afterwards called\r\nat Rome Appius Claudius, when he himself, being an adviser of peace, was\r\nhard put to it by those who abetted the war, and was not a match for the\r\nfaction, fled from Regillum to Rome, accompanied by a great number of\r\nclients. The rights of citizenship and land on the other side of the\r\nAnio were conferred on them. It was called the old Claudian tribe, and\r\nwas increased by the addition of some tribesmen who had come from that\r\ncountry. Appius, being chosen into the senate, was soon after advanced,\r\nto the highest dignity of that order. The consuls having entered the\r\nterritories of the Sabines with a hostile army, after they had, both by\r\nlaying waste their country, and afterwards by defeating them in battle,\r\nso weakened the power of the enemy, that they had no reason to dread\r\ntheir taking up arms again for a long time, returned to Rome in triumph.\r\nThe following year, Agrippa Menenius and P. Posthumius being consuls, P.\r\nValerius, allowed by universal consent to be the ablest man in Rome, in\r\nthe arts both of peace and war, died in the height of glory, but so\r\npoor, that means to defray the expenses of his funeral were wanting: he\r\nwas buried at the public charge. The matrons mourned for him as they had\r\ndone for Brutus. The same year two Latin colonies, Pometia and Cora,\r\nrevolted to the Auruncians. War was commenced against the Auruncians,\r\nand after defeating a numerous army of them who boldly met the consuls\r\nentering their frontiers, the whole Auruncian war was confined to\r\nPometia. Nor, after the battle was over, did they refrain from slaughter\r\nmore than in the heat of the action; for a greater number were slain\r\nthan taken, and the prisoners they put to death indiscriminately. Nor\r\ndid the enemy, in their resentment, spare even the three hundred\r\nhostages which they had received. This year also the consuls triumphed\r\nat Rome.\r\n\r\n17. The following consuls, Opiter Virginius and Sp. Cassius, first\r\nendeavoured to take Pometia by storm, and afterwards by raising vineæ\r\nand other works. But the Auruncians, prompted more by an irreconcilable\r\nhatred against them, than induced by hopes of success, or by a\r\nfavourable opportunity, sallied out of the town, and though more of them\r\nwere armed with lighted torches than swords, filled all places with fire\r\nand slaughter. After they had burnt down the vineæ, slain and wounded\r\nmany of the enemy, they were near killing one of the consuls, who had\r\nbeen thrown from his horse and severely wounded (which of them authors\r\ndo not mention). Upon this they returned to Rome, foiled in their\r\nobject; the consul was left among many more who were wounded with very\r\nuncertain hopes of his recovery. After a short time, sufficient for\r\ncuring their wounds and recruiting their army, they marched against\r\nPometia with redoubled fury and augmented strength. When, the vineæ\r\nhaving been repaired and the other apparatus of war, the soldiers were\r\non the point of scaling the walls, the town surrendered. Yet though the\r\ntown had surrendered, the leading men of the Auruncians, with no less\r\ncruelty than if it had been taken by assault, were beheaded\r\nindiscriminately; the others who were colonists were sold by auction,\r\nthe town was razed, and the land sold. The consuls obtained a triumph\r\nmore from having severely gratified their revenge, than in consequence\r\nof the importance of the war thus brought to a close.\r\n\r\n18. The following year had Postumus Cominius and T. Lartius for consuls.\r\nOn this year, during the celebration of the games at Rome, as some of\r\nthe courtesans were being carried off by some of the Sabine youth in a\r\nfrolic, a mob having assembled, a scuffle ensued, and almost a battle;\r\nand from this inconsiderable affair the whole nation seemed inclined to\r\na renewal of hostilities. Besides the dread of the Latin war, this\r\naccession was further made to their fears; certain intelligence was\r\nreceived that thirty different states had entered into a confederacy\r\nagainst them, at the instigation of Octavius Mamilius. While the city\r\nwas perplexed amid this expectation of such important events, mention\r\nwas made for the first time of nominating a dictator. But in what year\r\nor who the consuls[80] were in whom confidence was not reposed, because\r\nthey were of the Tarquinian faction, (for that also is recorded,) or who\r\nwas elected dictator for the first time, is not satisfactorily\r\nestablished. Among the oldest writers however I find that Titus Lartius\r\nwas appointed the first dictator, and Spurius Cassius master of the\r\nhorse. They chose men of consular dignity, for so the law, made for the\r\nelection of a dictator, ordained. For this reason, I am more inclined to\r\nbelieve that Lartius, who was of consular rank, was annexed to the\r\nconsuls as their director and master, rather than Manius Valerius, the\r\nson of Marcus and grandson of Volesus, who had not yet been consul. For,\r\nhad they intended to choose a dictator from that family in particular,\r\nthey would much rather have chosen his father, Marcus Valerius, a\r\nconsular person, and a man of distinguished merit. On the creation of\r\nthe dictator first at Rome, when they saw the axes carried before him,\r\ngreat awe struck the common people, so that they became more submissive\r\nto obey orders. For neither was there now, as under the consuls who\r\npossessed equal power, the assistance of one of the two, nor was there\r\nappeal, nor was there any resource any where but in attentive\r\nsubmission. The creation of a dictator at Rome terrified the Sabines,\r\nand the more effectually, because they thought he was created on their\r\naccount.[81] Wherefore they sent ambassadors to sue for peace, to whom,\r\nwhen earnestly entreating the dictator and senate to pardon the young\r\nmen's offence, an answer was given that the young men could easily be\r\nforgiven, but not the old men, who continually raised one war after\r\nanother. Nevertheless they continued to treat about a peace, and it\r\nwould have been granted, if the Sabines would bring themselves to make\r\ngood the expenses incurred on the war (for that was demanded). War was\r\nproclaimed; a tacit truce kept the year quiet.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: _Nec quibus consulibus parum creditum sit_, scil. fides\r\nnon habita fuerit. Arnold in his Roman Hist. considers this to have been\r\nthe true cause of creating a dictator.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: _Eo magis quod propter se._ From this one would be\r\ndisposed to suspect that the dictator was created to take on him the\r\nmanagement of war. See Nieb. p. 553, and Niebhr. Epit. by Twiss, Append.\r\np. 355.]\r\n\r\n19. Servius Sulpicius and M. Tullius were consuls the next year: nothing\r\nworth mentioning happened. Then T. Æbutius and C. Vetusius. In their\r\nconsulship, Fidenæ was besieged, Crustumeria taken, and Præneste\r\nrevolted from the Latins to the Romans. Nor was the Latin war, which had\r\nbeen fomenting for several years, any longer deferred. A. Postumius\r\ndictator, and T. Æbutius his master of the horse, marching with a\r\nnumerous army of horse and foot, met the enemy's forces at the lake\r\nRegillus, in the territory of Tusculum, and, because it was heard that\r\nthe Tarquins were in the army of the Latins, their rage could not be\r\nrestrained, but they must immediately come to an engagement. Accordingly\r\nthe battle was more obstinate and fierce than usual. For the generals\r\nwere present not only to direct matters by their orders, but even\r\ncharged one another, exposing their own persons. And there was hardly\r\nany of the principal officers of either side who came off unwounded\r\nexcept the Roman dictator. As Postumius was drawing up his men and\r\nencouraging them in the first line, Tarquinius Superbus, though now\r\nenfeebled by age, spurred on his horse with great fury to attack him;\r\nbut being wounded in the side, he was carried off by a party of his own\r\nmen to a place of safety. In the other wing also, Æbutius, master of the\r\nhorse, had charged Octavius Mamilius; nor was his approach unobserved by\r\nthe Tusculan general, who also briskly spurred on his horse to encounter\r\nhim. And such was their impetuosity as they advanced with hostile\r\nspears, that Æbutius was run through the arm and Mamilius struck on the\r\nbreast. The Latins received the latter into their second line; but as\r\nÆbutius was not able to wield his lance with his wounded arm, he retired\r\nfrom the battle. The Latin general, not in the least discouraged by his\r\nwound, stirs up the fight; and because he saw his own men begin to give\r\nground, sent for a company of Roman exiles to support them, commanded by\r\nTarquin's son. This body, inasmuch as they fought with greater fury from\r\nhaving been banished from their country, and lost their estates,\r\nrestored the battle for a short time.\r\n\r\n20. When the Romans were beginning to give ground on that side, M.\r\nValerius, brother to Poplicola, having observed young Tarquin boldly\r\nfiguring away at the head of his exiles, fired with the renown of his\r\nfamily, that the slaying of the princes might belong to the same family\r\nwhose glory their expulsion had been, clapped spurs to his horse, and\r\nwith his javelin presented made towards Tarquin. Tarquin retired from\r\nhis violent enemy into a battalion of his own men. As Valerius rushed\r\nrashly into the line of the exiles, one of them ran him sideways through\r\nthe body, and as the horse was in no way retarded by the wound of his\r\nrider, the expiring Roman fell to the ground, his arms falling over him.\r\nPostumius the dictator, on seeing so distinguished a man slain, the\r\nexiles advancing boldly in a body, and his own men disheartened and\r\ngiving ground, gives the signal to his own cohort, a chosen body of men\r\nwhich he kept for the defence of his person, to treat every Roman\r\nsoldier whom they should see fly from the battle as an enemy. Upon this\r\nthe Romans, by reason of the danger on both sides, turned from their\r\nflight against the enemy, and, the battle being restored, the dictator's\r\ncohort now for the first time engaged in the fight, and with fresh\r\nvigour and undaunted resolution falling on the wearied exiles, cut them\r\nto pieces. Here another engagement took place between the leading\r\nofficers. The Latin general, on seeing the cohort of the exiles almost\r\nsurrounded by the Roman dictator, advanced in haste to the front with\r\nsome companies of the body of reserve. T. Herminius, a\r\nlieutenant-general, having seen them moving in a body, and well knowing\r\nMamilius, distinguished from the rest by his armour and dress,\r\nencountered the leader of the enemy with a force so much superior to\r\nthat wherewith the general of the horse had lately done, that at one\r\nthrust he ran him through the side and slew him; and while stripping\r\nthe body of his enemy, he himself received a wound with a javelin; and\r\nthough brought back to the camp victorious, yet he died during the first\r\ndressing of it. Then the dictator flies to the cavalry, entreating them\r\nin the most pressing terms, as the foot were tired out with fighting, to\r\ndismount from their horses and join the fight. They obeyed his orders,\r\ndismounted, flew to the front, and taking their post at the first line,\r\ncover themselves with their targets. The infantry immediately recovered\r\ncourage, when they saw the young noblemen sustaining a share of the\r\ndanger with them, the mode of fighting being now assimilated. Thus at\r\nlength were the Latins beaten back, and their line giving way,[82] they\r\nretreated. The horses were then brought up to the cavalry that they\r\nmight pursue the enemy, and the infantry likewise followed. On this, the\r\ndictator, omitting nothing (that could conciliate) divine or human aid,\r\nis said to have vowed a temple to Castor, and likewise to have promised\r\nrewards to the first and second of the soldiers who should enter the\r\nenemy's camp. And such was their ardour, that the Romans took the camp\r\nwith the same impetuosity wherewith they had routed the enemy in the\r\nfield. Such was the engagement at the lake Regillus. The dictator and\r\nmaster of the horse returned to the city in triumph.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: By giving up the advantage of their horses, and forgetting\r\ntheir superiority of rank.]\r\n\r\n21. For the next three years there was neither settled peace nor open\r\nwar. The consuls were Q. Clælius and T. Lartius. After them A.\r\nSempronius and M. Minucius. In their consulship, a temple was dedicated\r\nto Saturn, and the Saturnalia appointed to be kept as a festival. Then\r\nA. Postumius and T. Virginius were chosen consuls. In some authors I\r\nfind that the battle at the lake Regillus was not fought till this year,\r\nand that A. Postumius, because the fidelity of his colleague was\r\nsuspected, laid down his office, and thereupon was created dictator.\r\nSuch great mistakes of dates perplex one with the history of these\r\ntimes, the magistrates being arranged differently in different writers,\r\nthat you cannot determine what consuls succeeded certain consuls,[83]\r\nnor in what particular year every remarkable action happened, by reason\r\nof the antiquity, not only of the facts, but also of the historians.\r\nThen Ap. Claudius and P. Servilius were elected consuls. This year was\r\nremarkable for the news of Tarquin's death. He died at Cumæ, whither he\r\nhad fled to the tyrant Aristodemus, after the reduction of the power of\r\nthe Latins. The senate and people were elated by this news. But with the\r\nsenators their satisfaction was too extravagant, for by the chief men\r\namong them oppression began to be practised on the people to whom they\r\nhad to that day been attentive to the utmost of their power. The same\r\nyear the colony which king Tarquin had sent to Signia was recruited by\r\nfilling up the number of the colonists. The tribes at Rome were\r\nincreased to twenty-one. And the temple of Mercury was dedicated the\r\nfifteenth of May.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: Qui consules secundum quosdam, who were the consuls that\r\ncame after certain consuls.]\r\n\r\n22. During the Latin war, there had been neither peace nor war with the\r\nnation of the Volscians; for both the Volscians had raised auxiliary\r\ntroops to send to the Latins had not so much expedition been used by the\r\nRoman dictator, and the Roman employed this expedition that he might not\r\nhave to contend in one and the same battle with the Latin and the\r\nVolscian. In resentment of this, the consuls marched their army into the\r\nVolscian territory; the unexpected proceeding alarmed the Volscians, who\r\ndreaded no chastisement of mere intention; unmindful of arms, they gave\r\nthree hundred children of the principal men of Cora and Pometia as\r\nhostages. Upon this the legions were withdrawn without coming to any\r\naction. Not long after their natural disposition returned to the\r\nVolscians, now delivered of their fears; they again make secret\r\npreparation for war, having taken the Hernicians into an alliance with\r\nthem. They send ambassadors in every direction to stir up Latium. But\r\nthe recent defeat received at the lake Regillus, could scarcely restrain\r\nthe Latins from offering violence to the ambassadors through resentment\r\nand hatred of any one who would advise them to take up arms. Having\r\nseized the Volscians, they brought them to Rome. They were there\r\ndelivered up to the consuls, and information was given that the\r\nVolscians and Hernicians were making preparations for war against the\r\nRomans. The matter being referred to the senate, it was so gratifying to\r\nthe senators that they both sent back six thousand prisoners to the\r\nLatins, and referred to the new magistrates the business regarding the\r\ntreaty, which had been almost absolutely refused them. Upon this indeed\r\nthe Latins were heartily glad at what they had done, the advisers of\r\npeace were in high esteem. They send a crown of gold to the Capitol as\r\nan offering to Jupiter. Along with the ambassadors and the offering\r\nthere came a great crowd, consisting of the prisoners who had been sent\r\nback to their friends. They proceed to the houses of those persons with\r\nwhom each had been in servitude, and return thanks for their having been\r\ngenerously kept and treated during their calamity. They then form\r\nconnexions of hospitality. And never at any former time was the Latin\r\nname more closely united to the Roman state, either by public or private\r\nties.\r\n\r\n23. But both the Volscian war was threatening, and the state, being\r\ndisturbed within itself, glowed with intestine animosity between the\r\nsenate and people, chiefly on account of those confined for debt. They\r\ncomplained loudly, that whilst fighting abroad for liberty and dominion,\r\nthey were captured and oppressed at home by their fellow citizens; and\r\nthat the liberty of the people was more secure in war than in peace,\r\namong enemies than among their fellow citizens; and this feeling of\r\ndiscontent, increasing of itself, the striking sufferings of an\r\nindividual still further aggravated. A certain person advanced in years\r\nthrew himself into the forum with all the badges of his miseries on him.\r\nHis clothes were all over squalid, the figure of his body still more\r\nshocking, being pale and emaciated. In addition, a long beard and hair\r\nhad impressed a savage wildness on his countenance; in such wretchedness\r\nhe was known notwithstanding, and they said that he had been a\r\ncenturion, and compassionating him they mentioned openly other\r\ndistinctions (obtained) in the service: he himself exhibited scars on\r\nhis breast, testimonies of honourable battles in several places. To\r\npersons repeatedly inquiring, whence that garb, whence that ghastly\r\nappearance of body, (the multitude having now assembled around him\r\nalmost like a popular assembly,) he says, \"that whilst serving in the\r\nSabine war, because he had not only been deprived of the produce of his\r\nland in consequence of the depredations of the enemy, but also his\r\nresidence had been burned down, all his effects pillaged, his cattle\r\ndriven off, a tax imposed on him at a time very distressing to him, he\r\nhad incurred debt; that this debt, aggravated by usury, had stripped\r\nhim first of his father's and grandfather's farm, then of his other\r\nproperty; lastly that a pestilence, as it were, had reached his person.\r\nThat he was taken by his creditor, not into servitude, but into a house\r\nof correction and a place of execution.\" He then showed his back\r\ndisfigured with the marks of stripes still recent. At the hearing and\r\nseeing of this a great uproar takes place. The tumult is now no longer\r\nconfined to the forum, but spreads through the entire city. Those who\r\nwere confined for debt, and those who were now at their liberty, hurry\r\ninto the streets from all quarters and implore the protection of the\r\npeople. In no place is there wanting a voluntary associate of sedition.\r\nThey run through all the streets in crowds to the forum with loud\r\nshouts. Such of the senators as happened to be in the forum, fell in\r\nwith this mob with great peril to themselves; nor would they have\r\nrefrained from violence, had not the consuls, P. Servilius and Ap.\r\nClaudius, hastily interfered to quell the disturbance. The multitude\r\nturning towards them, and showing their chains and other marks of\r\nwretchedness, said that they deserved all this, taunting them (the\r\nconsuls) each with the military services performed by himself, one in\r\none place, and another in another. They require them with menaces,\r\nrather than as suppliants, to assemble the senate, and stand round the\r\nsenate-house in a body, determined themselves to be witnesses and\r\ndirectors of the public counsels. Very few of the senators, whom chance\r\nhad thrown in the way, were forced to attend the consuls; fear prevented\r\nthe rest from coming not only to the house, but even to the forum. Nor\r\ncould any thing be done by reason of the thinness of the senate. Then\r\nindeed the people began to think their demand was eluded, and the\r\nredress of their grievances delayed; that such of the senators as had\r\nabsented themselves did so not through chance or fear, but on purpose to\r\nobstruct the business. That the consuls themselves trifled with them,\r\nthat their miseries were now a mere subject of mockery. By this time the\r\nsedition was come to such a height, that the majesty of the consuls\r\ncould hardly restrain the violence of the people. Wherefore, uncertain\r\nwhether they incurred greater danger by staying at home, or venturing\r\nabroad, they came at length to the senate; but though the house was at\r\nlength full, a want of agreement manifested itself, not only among the\r\nfathers, but even between the consuls themselves. Appius, a man of\r\nviolent temper, thought the matter was to be done by the authority of\r\nthe consuls, and that if one or two were seized, the rest would be\r\nquiet. Servilius, more inclined to moderate measures, thought that while\r\ntheir minds were in this ferment, it would be both more safe and more\r\neasy to bend than to break them. Amidst these debates, another terror of\r\na more serious nature presented itself.\r\n\r\n24. Some Latin horse came full speed to Rome, with the alarming news\r\nthat the Volscians were marching with a hostile army, to besiege the\r\ncity, the announcement of which (so completely had discord made the\r\nstate two from one) affected the senators and people in a far different\r\nmanner. The people exulted with joy, and said, that the gods were come\r\nas avengers of the tyranny of the fathers. They encouraged one another\r\nnot to enrol their names, that it was better that all should perish\r\ntogether, than that they should perish alone. That the patricians should\r\nserve as soldiers, that the patricians should take up arms, so that the\r\nperils of war should remain with those with whom the advantages were.\r\nBut the senate, dejected and confounded by the two-fold terror, that\r\nfrom their own countrymen, and that from the enemy, entreated the consul\r\nServilius, whose temper was more conciliating, that he would extricate\r\nthe commonwealth beset with such great terrors. Then the consul,\r\ndismissing the senate, proceeds into the assembly. There he shows them\r\nthat the senate were solicitous that care should be taken for the\r\npeople's interest: but their alarm for the whole commonwealth had\r\ninterrupted their deliberation regarding that which was no doubt the\r\ngreatest part, but yet only a part; nor could they, when the enemy were\r\nalmost at the gates, allow any thing to take precedence of war: nor, if\r\nthere should be some respite, was it either to the credit of the people\r\nnot to have taken up arms in defence of their country unless they first\r\nreceive a recompence, nor consistent with the dignity of the senators\r\nthat they adopted measures of relief for the distresses of their\r\ncountrymen through fear rather than afterwards from inclination. He gave\r\nadditional confidence to the assembly by an edict, by which he ordained\r\nthat no one \"should detain a Roman citizen either in chains or in\r\nprison, so as to hinder his enrolling his name under the consuls. And\r\nthat nobody should either seize or sell the goods of any soldier, while\r\nhe was in the camp, or arrest his children or grandchildren.\" This\r\nordinance being published, the debtors under arrest who were present\r\nimmediately entered their names, and crowds of persons hastening from\r\nall quarters of the city from their confinement, as their creditors had\r\nno right to detain their persons, ran together into the forum to take\r\nthe military oath. These made up a considerable body of men, nor was the\r\nbravery or activity of the others more conspicuous in the Volscian war.\r\nThe consul led out his army against the enemy, and pitched his camp at a\r\nlittle distance from them.\r\n\r\n25. The next night the Volscians, relying on the dissension among the\r\nRomans, made an attempt on their camp, to see if any desertion or\r\ntreachery might be resorted to during the night. The sentinels on guard\r\nperceived them; the army was called up, and the signal being given they\r\nran to arms. Thus that attempt of the Volscians was frustrated; the\r\nremainder of the night was dedicated to repose on both sides. The next\r\nmorning at daybreak the Volscians, having filled the trenches, attacked\r\nthe rampart. And already the fortifications were being demolished on\r\nevery side, when the consul, although all on every side, and more\r\nespecially the debtors, cried out that he should give the signal, having\r\ndelayed a little while for the purpose of trying the feelings of the\r\nsoldiers, when their great ardour became sufficiently apparent, having\r\nat length given the signal for sallying forth, he lets out the soldiers\r\nnow impatient for the fight. At the very first onset the enemy were\r\nrouted; the rear of them who fled was harassed, as long as the infantry\r\nwas able to overtake them; the cavalry drove them in consternation to\r\ntheir very camp. In a little time the camp itself was taken and\r\nplundered, the legions having surrounded it, as the panic had driven the\r\nVolscians even from thence also. On the next day the legions being led\r\nto Suessa Pometia, whither the enemy had retreated, in a few days the\r\ntown is taken; when taken, it was given up for plunder: by these means\r\nthe needy soldiers were somewhat relieved. The consul leads back his\r\nvictorious army to Rome with the greatest glory to himself: as he is\r\nsetting out for Rome, the deputies of the Ecetrans, (a part) of the\r\nVolscians, alarmed for their state after the taking of Pometia, come to\r\nhim. By a decree of the senate peace is granted them, but their land is\r\ntaken from them.\r\n\r\n26. Immediately after the Sabines also caused an alarm to the Romans;\r\nbut it was rather a tumult than a war. It was announced in the city\r\nduring the night that a Sabine army had advanced as far as the river\r\nAnio, plundering the country: that the country houses there were\r\npillaged and burnt down indiscriminately. A. Postumius, who had been\r\ndictator in the Latin war, was immediately sent against them with all\r\nthe horse. The consul Servilius followed him with a chosen body of foot.\r\nThe cavalry cut off most of the stragglers; nor did the Sabine legion\r\nmake any resistance against the foot when they came up with them. Being\r\ntired both by their march and their plundering the country in the night,\r\nand a great number of them being surfeited with eating and drinking in\r\nthe cottages, they had scarcely sufficient strength for flight. The\r\nSabine war being thus heard of and finished in one night, on the\r\nfollowing day, amid sanguine hope of peace being secured in every\r\nquarter, ambassadors from the Auruncians come to the senate, proclaiming\r\nwar unless the troops are withdrawn from the Volscian territory. The\r\narmy of the Auruncians had set out from home simultaneously with the\r\nambassadors; the report of which having been seen not far from Aricia,\r\nexcited such a tumult among the Romans, that neither the senate could be\r\nconsulted in regular form, nor could they, while themselves taking up\r\narms, give a pacific answer to those advancing against them in arms.\r\nThey march to Aricia with a determined army, come to an engagement not\r\nfar from thence, and in one battle put an end to the war.\r\n\r\n27. After the defeat of the Auruncians, the people of Rome, victorious\r\nin so many wars within a few days, were expecting the promises of the\r\nconsul and the engagement of the senate (to be made good). But Appius,\r\nboth through his natural pride, and in order to undermine the credit of\r\nhis colleague, issued his decrees regarding borrowed money, with all\r\npossible severity. And from this time, both those who had been formerly\r\nin confinement were delivered up to their creditors, and others also\r\nwere taken into custody. When this happened to a soldier, he appealed to\r\nthe colleague, and a crowd gathered about Servilius: they represented to\r\nhim his promises, severally upbraided him with their services in war,\r\nand with the scars they had received. They loudly called upon him to lay\r\nthe matter before the senate, and that, as consul, he would relieve his\r\nfellow citizens, as a general, his soldiers. These remonstrances\r\naffected the consul, but the situation of affairs obliged him to back\r\nout; so completely had not only his colleague, but the whole body of the\r\npatricians, adopted an entirely opposite course. And thus, by acting a\r\nmiddle part, he neither escaped the odium of the people, nor gained the\r\nfavour of the senators. The fathers looked upon him as a weak,\r\npopularity-hunting consul, and the people considered him as a deceiver.\r\nAnd it soon appeared that he was as odious to them as Appius himself. A\r\ndispute had happened between the consuls, as to which should dedicate\r\nthe temple of Mercury. The senate referred the affair from themselves to\r\nthe people, and ordained that to whichsoever of them the dedication\r\nshould be granted by order of the people, he should preside over the\r\nmarkets, establish a company of merchants, and perform the functions of\r\na pontifex maximus. The people gave the dedication of the temple to M.\r\nLætorius, the centurion of the first legion, that it might plainly\r\nappear to have been done not so much out of respect to a person on whom\r\nan honour above his rank had been conferred, as to affront the consuls.\r\nUpon this one of the consuls particularly, and the senators, were highly\r\nincensed. But the people had acquired courage, and proceeded in a manner\r\nquite different from what they had at first intended. For when they\r\ndespaired of redress from the consuls and senate, upon seeing a debtor\r\nled to the court, they flew together from all quarters. And neither the\r\ndecree of the consul could be heard in consequence of the noise and\r\nclamour, nor, when he had pronounced the decree, did any one obey it.\r\nAll was managed by violence, and the entire dread and danger with\r\nrespect to personal liberty, was transferred from the debtors to the\r\ncreditors, who were severally abused by the crowd in the very sight of\r\nthe consul. In addition to all this, the dread of the Sabine war spread,\r\nand when a levy was decreed, nobody gave in his name; Appius being\r\nenraged, and bitterly inveighing against the ambitious arts of his\r\ncolleague, who by his popular silence was betraying the republic, and\r\nbesides his not passing sentence against the debtors, likewise neglected\r\nto raise the levies, after they had been voted by the senate. Yet he\r\ndeclared, that \"the commonwealth was not entirely deserted, nor the\r\nconsular authority altogether debased. That he alone would vindicate\r\nboth his own dignity and that of the senators.\" When a daily mob,\r\nemboldened by licentiousness, stood round him, he commanded a noted\r\nringleader of the sedition to be apprehended. He, as the lictors were\r\ncarrying him off, appealed to the people; nor would the consul have\r\nallowed the appeal, because there was no doubt regarding the judgment of\r\nthe people, had not his obstinacy been with difficulty overcome, rather\r\nby the advice and influence of the leading men, than by the clamours of\r\nthe people; so much resolution he had to bear the weight of their odium.\r\nThe evil gained ground daily, not only by open clamours, but, which was\r\nfar more dangerous, by a secession and by secret meetings. At length the\r\nconsuls, so odious to the commons, went out of office: Servilius liked\r\nby neither party, Appius highly esteemed by the senators.\r\n\r\n28. Then A. Virginius and T. Vetusius enter on the consulship. Upon this\r\nthe commons, uncertain what sort of consuls they were to have, held\r\nnightly meetings, some of them upon the Esquiline, and others upon the\r\nAventine hill, that they might not be confused by hasty resolutions in\r\nthe forum, or take their measures inconsiderately and without concert.\r\nThe consuls, judging this proceeding to be of dangerous tendency, as it\r\nreally was, laid the matter before the senate. But they were not allowed\r\nafter proposing it to take the votes regularly; so tumultuously was it\r\nreceived on all sides by the clamours and indignation of the fathers, at\r\nthe consuls throwing on the senate the odium of that which should have\r\nbeen put down by consular authority. \"That if there really were\r\nmagistrates in the republic, there would have been no council in Rome\r\nbut the public one. That the republic was now divided and split into a\r\nthousand senate-houses and assemblies, some of which were held on the\r\nEsquiline, others on the Aventine hill. That one man, in truth such as\r\nAppius Claudius, for that that was more than a consul, would in a moment\r\ndisperse these private meetings.\" When the consuls, thus rebuked, asked\r\nthem, \"What they desired them to do, for that they would act with as\r\nmuch energy and vigour as the senators wished,\" they resolve that they\r\nshould push on the levies as briskly as possible, that the people were\r\nbecome insolent from want of employment. When the house broke up, the\r\nconsuls ascend the tribunal and summon the young men by name. But none\r\nof them made any answer, and the people crowding round them, as if in a\r\ngeneral assembly, said, \"That the people would no longer be imposed on.\r\nThey should never list one soldier till the public faith was made good.\r\nThat liberty should be restored to each before arms were given, that\r\nthey might fight for their country and fellow citizens, and not for\r\narbitrary lords.\" The consuls fully understood the orders they had\r\nreceived from the senate, but they saw none of those who had talked so\r\nbig within the walls of the senate-house present themselves to take any\r\nshare with them in the public odium. A desperate contest with the\r\ncommons seemed at hand. Therefore, before they would have recourse to\r\nextremities, they thought it advisable to consult the senate a second\r\ntime. Then indeed the younger senators flocked in a hurry round the\r\nchairs of the consuls, commanding them to abdicate the consulate, and\r\nresign an office which they had not courage to support.\r\n\r\n29. Having sufficiently tried both[84] ways, the consuls at length said,\r\n\"Conscript fathers, lest you may say that you were not forewarned, a\r\ngreat disturbance is at hand. We require that they who accuse us most\r\nseverely of cowardice, would assist us in raising the levies; we shall\r\nproceed according to the resolution of the most intrepid amongst you,\r\nsince it so pleases you.\" They return to their tribunal, and on purpose\r\ncommanded one of the most factious of the people, who stood in their\r\nview, to be called upon by name. When he stood mute, and a number of men\r\nstood round him in a ring, to prevent his being seized, the consuls sent\r\na lictor to him. He being repulsed, such of the fathers as attended the\r\nconsuls, exclaiming against it as an intolerable insult, ran in a hurry\r\nfrom the tribunal to assist the lictor. But when the violence was turned\r\nfrom the lictor, who suffered nothing else but being prevented from\r\nseizing him, against the fathers, the riot was quelled by the\r\ninterposition of the consuls, in which however, without stones or\r\nweapons, there was more noise and angry words than mischief done. The\r\nsenate, called in a tumultuous manner, is consulted in a manner still\r\nmore tumultuous; such as had been beaten, calling out for an inquiry,\r\nand the most violent members declaring their sentiments no less by\r\nclamours and noise than by their votes. At length, when their passion\r\nhad subsided, the consuls reproaching them with there being as much\r\ndisorderly conduct in the senate as in the forum, the house began to\r\nvote in regular order. There were three different opinions: P. Virginius\r\ndid not make the [85]matter general. He voted that they should consider\r\nonly those who, relying on the promise of P. Servilius the consul, had\r\nserved in a war against the Auruncans and Sabines. Titius Largius was of\r\nopinion, \"That it was not now a proper time to reward services only.\r\nThat all the people were immersed in debt, and that a stop could not be\r\nput to the evil, unless measures were adopted for all. And that if the\r\ncondition of different parties be different, the divisions would rather\r\nbe thereby inflamed than composed.\" Appius Claudius, who was naturally\r\nsevere, and, by the hatred of the commons on the one hand, and praises\r\nof the senators on the other, was become quite infuriated, said, \"That\r\nthese riots proceeded not from distress, but from licentiousness. That\r\nthe people were rather wanton than violent. That this terrible mischief\r\ntook its rise from the right of appeal; since threats, not authority,\r\nwas all that belonged to the consuls, while permission was given to\r\nappeal to those who were accomplices in the crime. Come,\" added he, \"let\r\nus create a dictator from whom there lies no appeal; this madness, which\r\nhath set every thing in a flame, will immediately subside. Let any one\r\ndare then to strike a lictor, when he shall know that his back, and even\r\nhis life, are in the power of that person whose authority he has\r\ninsulted.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: The determination of the plebeians and senators.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: _rem non vulgabat_, was not for extending the relief to\r\nall.]\r\n\r\n30. To many the opinion of Appius appeared, as it really was, severe and\r\nviolent. On the other hand, those of Virginius and Largius were not safe\r\nfor the precedent they established; especially they thought that of\r\nLargius so, as it would destroy all credit. The opinion of Virginius was\r\nreckoned to be most moderate, and a happy medium between the other two.\r\nBut through the spirit of faction and a regard of private interest,\r\nwhich always have and always will obstruct the public councils, Appius\r\nprevailed, and was himself near being created dictator; which step would\r\ncertainly have alienated the commons at this most dangerous juncture,\r\nwhen the Volsci, the Æqui, and the Sabines happened to be all in arms at\r\nthe same time. But the consuls and elder senators took care that this\r\noffice, in its own nature uncontrollable, should be committed to a man\r\nof moderate temper. They choose Manius Valerius, son of Volesus,\r\ndictator. The people, though they saw that this magistrate was created\r\nagainst themselves, yet as they had got the right of appeal by his\r\nbrother's law, dreaded nothing oppressive or tyrannical from that\r\nfamily. An edict of the dictator's, which was almost the same with that\r\npublished by the consul Servilius, afterwards confirmed their minds. But\r\njudging it safer to confide in both the man and in the absolute power\r\nwith which he was vested, they gave in their names, desisting from all\r\ncontest. Ten legions were levied, a greater army than had ever been\r\nraised before. Each of the consuls had three legions assigned him, and\r\nthe dictator commanded four. Nor could the war be deferred any longer.\r\nThe Æqui had made incursions upon the Latin territory; the deputies of\r\nthe Latins begged the senate either to send them assistance, or to allow\r\nthem to arm themselves for the purpose of defending their own frontiers.\r\nIt seemed safer that the Latins should be defended without arming, than\r\nto allow them to take up arms again. Wherefore Vetusius the consul was\r\nsent to their assistance; this immediately put a stop to the\r\ndevastations. The Æqui retired from the plains, and depending more on\r\nthe advantage of the ground than on their arms, secured themselves on\r\nthe summits of the mountains. The other consul, having marched against\r\nthe Volsci, in order that he too might not waste time, challenged the\r\nenemy to pitch their camp nigh to his, and to risk an engagement by\r\nravaging their lands. Both armies stood in order of battle before their\r\nlines in a plain between the two camps. The Volsci had considerably the\r\nadvantage in number. Accordingly they rushed on to the fight, in a\r\ncareless manner, and as if contemptuously. The Roman consul neither\r\nadvanced his forces, and not suffering the enemy's shouts to be\r\nreturned, he ordered them to stand still with their spears fixed in the\r\nground, and when the enemy came up, to draw their swords and fall upon\r\nthem with all their force. The Volsci, wearied with running and\r\nshouting, set upon the Romans as if they had been quite benumbed\r\nthrough fear; but when they found the vigorous resistance that was made,\r\nand saw their swords glittering before their face, they turned their\r\nbacks in great disorder, just as if they had fallen into an ambuscade.\r\nNor had they strength sufficient even for flight, as they had advanced\r\nto the battle in full speed. The Romans, on the other hand, as they had\r\nnot stirred from their ground in the beginning of the action, being\r\nfresh and vigorous, easily overtook the enemy, who were weary, took\r\ntheir camp by assault, and after driving them thence, pursued them to\r\nVelitræ, into which the conquered and conquerors entered in a body. By\r\nthe promiscuous slaughter which was here made of all ranks, there was\r\nmore blood spilt than in the battle itself. Quarter was given to a small\r\nnumber of them, who threw down their arms and surrendered.\r\n\r\n31. Whilst these things are going on among the Volsci, the dictator\r\nrouts, puts to flight, and strips of their camp, the Sabines, where by\r\nfar the most serious part of the war lay. By a charge of his cavalry he\r\nhad thrown into confusion the centre of the enemy's line, where, by the\r\nwings extending themselves too far, they had not strengthened their line\r\nby a suitable depth of files.[86] The infantry fell upon them in this\r\nconfusion, by one and the same charge their camp was taken and the war\r\nconcluded. There was no other battle in those times more memorable than\r\nthis since the action at the lake Regillus. The dictator is borne into\r\nthe city in triumph. Besides the usual honours, a place in the circus\r\nwas assigned to him and his descendants, to see the public games; a\r\ncurule chair was fixed in that place. The lands of Velitræ were taken\r\nfrom the conquered Volsci: colonists were sent from the city to Velitræ,\r\nand a colony planted there. Soon after there was an engagement with the\r\nÆqui, but contrary to the wish of the consul, because they had to\r\napproach the enemy by disadvantageous ground. But the soldiers\r\ncomplaining that the war was on purpose spun out, that the dictator\r\nmight resign his office before they returned home to the city, and so\r\nhis promises might fall to the ground without effect, as those of the\r\nconsul had done before, forced him at all hazards to march his army up\r\nthe hill. This imprudent step, by the cowardice of the enemy, turned out\r\nsuccessfully; for before the Romans came within reach of a dart, the\r\nÆqui, quite amazed at their boldness, abandoned their camp, which was\r\nsituated in a very strong position, and ran down into the valleys on the\r\nopposite side.[87] In it abundance of booty was found, and the victory\r\nwas a bloodless one. Matters being thus successfully managed in war in\r\nthree different directions, anxiety respecting the event of their\r\ndomestic differences had left neither the senators nor the people. With\r\nsuch powerful influence, and with such art also, had the money-lenders\r\nmade their arrangements, so as to disappoint not only the people, but\r\neven the dictator himself. For Valerius, after the return of the consul\r\nVetusius, first of all matters brought before the senate that relating\r\nto the victorious people, and proposed the question, what it was their\r\ndetermination should be done with respect to those confined for debt.\r\nAnd when this motion was rejected, \"I am not acceptable,\" says he, \"as\r\nan adviser of concord. You will ere long wish, depend on it, that the\r\ncommons of Rome had patrons similar to me. For my part, I will neither\r\nfurther disappoint my fellow citizens, nor will I be dictator to no\r\npurpose. Intestine dissensions, foreign wars, caused the republic to\r\nrequire such a magistrate. Peace has been secured abroad, it is impeded\r\nat home. I will be a witness to disturbance as a private citizen rather\r\nthan as dictator.\" Then quitting the senate-house, he abdicated his\r\ndictatorship. The case appeared to the commons, that he had resigned his\r\noffice indignant at the treatment shown to them. Accordingly, as if his\r\nengagements to them had been fully discharged, since it had not been his\r\nfault that they were not made good, they attended him when returning to\r\nhis home with approbation and applause.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: i. e. by deepening the files.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: \"On the opposite side.\" Gronovius proposes instead of\r\n_adversus_ to read _aversas_: scil. the valleys behind them, or in their\r\nrear.]\r\n\r\n32. Fear then seized the senators lest, if the army should be dismissed,\r\nsecret meetings and conspiracies would be renewed; wherefore though the\r\nlevy had been held by the dictator, yet supposing that, as they had\r\nsworn obedience to the consuls, the soldiers were bound by their oath,\r\nunder the pretext of hostilities being renewed by the Æqui, they ordered\r\nthe legions to be led out of the city; by which proceeding the sedition\r\nwas hastened. And it is said that at first it was in contemplation to\r\nput the consuls to death, that they might be discharged from their oath:\r\nbut that being afterwards informed that no religious obligation could be\r\ndissolved by a criminal act, they, by the advice of one Sicinius,\r\nretired, without the orders of the consuls, to the sacred mount, beyond\r\nthe river Anio, three miles from the city: this account is more general\r\nthan that which Piso has given, that the secession was made to the\r\nAventine. There without any leader, their camp being fortified with a\r\nrampart and trench, remaining quiet, taking nothing but what was\r\nnecessary for sustenance, they kept themselves for several days, neither\r\nbeing attacked, nor attacking others. Great was the panic in the city,\r\nand through mutual fear all was suspense. The people left in the city\r\ndreaded the violence of the senators; the senators dreaded the people\r\nremaining in the city, uncertain whether they should prefer them to stay\r\nor to depart; but how long would the multitude which had seceded, remain\r\nquiet? what were to be the consequences then, if, in the mean time, any\r\nforeign war should break out? they certainly considered no hope left,\r\nsave in the concord of the citizens; this should be restored to the\r\nstate by fair or by unfair means. It was resolved therefore that there\r\nshould be sent as ambassador to the people, Menenius Agrippa, an\r\neloquent man, and one who was a favourite with the people, because he\r\nderived his origin from them. He being admitted into the camp, is said\r\nto have related to them merely the following story in that antiquated\r\nand uncouth style; \"At a time when all the parts in the human body did\r\nnot, as now, agree together, but the several members had each its own\r\nscheme, its own language, the other parts, indignant that every thing\r\nwas procured for the belly by their care, labour, and service; that the\r\nbelly, remaining quiet in the centre, did nothing but enjoy the\r\npleasures afforded it. They conspired accordingly, that the hands should\r\nnot convey food to the mouth, nor the mouth receive it when presented,\r\nnor the teeth chew it: whilst they wished under the influence of this\r\nfeeling to subdue the belly by famine, the members themselves and the\r\nentire body were reduced to the last degree of emaciation. Thence it\r\nbecame apparent that the service of the belly was by no means a slothful\r\none; that it did not so much receive nourishment as supply it, sending\r\nto all parts of the body this blood by which we live and possess\r\nvigour, distributed equally to the veins when perfected by the digestion\r\nof the food.\" By comparing in this way how similar the intestine\r\nsedition of the body was to the resentment of the people against the\r\nsenators, he made an impression on the minds of the multitude.\r\n\r\n33. Then a commencement was made to treat of a reconciliation, and among\r\nthe conditions it was allowed, \"that the commons should have their own\r\nmagistrates, with inviolable privileges, who should have the power of\r\nbringing assistance against the consuls, and that it should not be\r\nlawful for any of the patricians to hold that office.\" Thus two tribunes\r\nof the commons were created, Caius Licinius and L. Albinus. These\r\ncreated three colleagues for themselves. It is clear that among these\r\nwas Sicinius, the adviser of the sedition; with respect to two, who they\r\nwere is not so clear. There are some who say, that only two tribunes\r\nwere elected on the sacred mount, and that there the devoting law was\r\npassed. During the secession of the commons, Sp. Cassius and Postumus\r\nCominius entered on the consulship. During their consulate, the treaty\r\nwith the Latin states was concluded. To ratify this, one of the consuls\r\nremained at Rome; the other being sent to the Volscian war, routs and\r\nputs to flight the Volscians of Antium, and continuing his pursuit of\r\nthem, now that they were driven into the town of Longula, he takes\r\npossession of the town. Next he took Polusca, also belonging to the\r\nVolscians; then he attacked Corioli with all his force. There was then\r\nin the camp, among the young noblemen, C. Marcius, a youth distinguished\r\nboth for intelligence and courage, who afterwards attained the cognomen\r\nof Coriolanus. When, as the Roman army was besieging Corioli, and was\r\nwholly intent on the townspeople, whom they kept shut up, without any\r\napprehension of war threatening from without, the Volscian legion,\r\nsetting out from Antium, suddenly attacked them, and, at the same time\r\nthe enemy sallied forth from the town, Marcius happened to be on guard.\r\nHe with a chosen body of men not only repelled the attack of those who\r\nhad sallied out, but boldly rushed in through the open gate, and having\r\ncut down all in the part of the city nearest him, and having hastily\r\nseized some fire, threw it in the houses adjoining to the wall. Upon\r\nthis the shouts of the townsmen mingling with the wailings of the women\r\nand children, occasioned by the first fright,[88] as is usual, both\r\nincreased the courage of the Romans, and dispirited the Volscians,\r\nseeing the city captured to the relief of which they had come. Thus the\r\nVolsci of Antium were defeated, the town of Corioli was taken. And so\r\nmuch did Marcius by his valour eclipse the reputation of the consul,\r\nthat had not the treaty concluded with the Latins by Sp. Cassius alone,\r\nbecause his colleague was absent, served as a memorial of it, it would\r\nhave been forgotten that Postumus Cominius had conducted the war with\r\nthe Volscians. The same year dies Agrippa Menenius, a man during all his\r\nlife equally a favourite with the senators and commons, still more\r\nendeared to the commons after the secession. To this man, the mediator\r\nand umpire in restoring concord among his countrymen, the ambassador of\r\nthe senators to the commons, the person who brought back the commons to\r\nthe city, were wanting the expenses of his funeral. The people buried\r\nhim by the contribution of a sextans from each person.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: I have here adopted the reading of Stacker and others,\r\nscil. _ad terrorem, ut solet, primum ortus_.]\r\n\r\n34. T. Geganius and P. Minutius were next elected consuls. In this year,\r\nwhen every thing was quiet from war abroad, and the dissensions were\r\nhealed at home, another much more serious evil fell upon the state;\r\nfirst a scarcity of provisions, in consequence of the lands lying\r\nuntilled during the secession of the commons; then a famine such as\r\nbefals those who are besieged. And it would have ended in the\r\ndestruction of the slaves at least, and indeed some of the commons also,\r\nhad not the consuls adopted precautionary measures, by sending persons\r\nin every direction to buy up corn, not only into Etruria on the coast to\r\nthe right of Ostia, and through the Volscians along the coast on the\r\nleft as far as Cumas, but into Sicily also, in quest of it. So far had\r\nthe hatred of their neighbours obliged them to stand in need of aid from\r\ndistant countries. When corn had been bought up at Cumæ, the ships were\r\ndetained in lieu of the property of the Tarquinii by the tyrant\r\nAristodemus, who was their heir. Among the Volsci and in the Pomptine\r\nterritory it could not even be purchased. The corn dealers themselves\r\nincurred danger from the violence of the inhabitants. Corn came from\r\nEtruria by the Tiber: by means of this the people were supported. Amid\r\nthis distressing scarcity they would have been harassed by a very\r\ninconvenient war, had not a dreadful pestilence attacked the Volsci when\r\nabout to commence hostilities. The minds of the enemy being alarmed by\r\nthis calamity, so that they were influenced by some terror, even after\r\nit had abated, the Romans both augmented the number of their colonists\r\nat Velitræ, and despatched a new colony to the mountains of Norba, to\r\nserve as a barrier in the Pomptine district. Then in the consulship of\r\nM. Minucius, and A. Sempronius, a great quantity of corn was imported\r\nfrom Sicily, and it was debated in the senate at what rate it should be\r\ngiven to the commons. Many were of opinion, that the time was come for\r\nputting down the commons, and for recovering those rights which had been\r\nwrested from the senators by secession and violence. In particular,\r\nMarcius Coriolanus, an enemy to tribunitian power, says, \"If they desire\r\nthe former rate of provisions, let them restore to the senators their\r\nformer rights. Why do I, after being sent under the yoke, after being,\r\nas it were, ransomed from robbers, behold plebeian magistrates, and\r\nSicinius invested with power? Shall I submit to these indignities longer\r\nthan is necessary? Shall I, who would not have endured King Tarquin,\r\ntolerate Sicinius. Let him now secede, let him call away the commons.\r\nThe road lies open to the sacred mount and to other hills. Let them\r\ncarry off the corn from our lands, as they did three years since. Let\r\nthem have the benefit of that scarcity which in their frenzy they have\r\noccasioned. I will venture to say, that, brought to their senses by\r\nthese sufferings, they will themselves become tillers of the lands,\r\nrather than, taking up arms and seceding, they would prevent them from\r\nbeing tilled.\" It is not so easy to say whether it should have been\r\ndone, as I think that it might have been practicable for the senators,\r\non the condition of lowering the price of provisions, to have rid\r\nthemselves of both the tribunitian power, and all the restraints imposed\r\non them against their will.[89]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: i. e. I think it might have been done; whether it would\r\nhave been right to do so, it is not so easy to decide. Livy means to say\r\nthat it was possible enough for the senators, by lowering the price of\r\ncorn, to get rid of the tribunes, &c. Such a judgment is easily formed;\r\nit is not, however, he says, so easy to determine, whether it would have\r\nbeen expedient to follow the advice of Coriolanus.]\r\n\r\n35. This proposal both appeared to the senate too harsh, and from\r\nexasperation well nigh drove the people to arms: \"that they were now\r\nassailed with famine, as if enemies, that they were defrauded of food\r\nand sustenance, that the foreign corn, the only support which fortune\r\nunexpectedly furnished to them, was being snatched from their mouth,\r\nunless the tribunes were given up in chains to C. Marcius, unless he\r\nglut his rage on the backs of the commons of Rome. That in him a new\r\nexecutioner had started up, who ordered them to die or be slaves.\" An\r\nassault would have been made on him as he left the senate-house, had not\r\nthe tribunes very opportunely appointed him a day for trial; by this\r\ntheir rage was suppressed, every one saw himself become the judge, the\r\narbiter of the life and death of his foe. At first Marcius heard the\r\nthreats of the tribunes with contempt.--\"That the right to afford aid,\r\nnot to inflict punishment, had been granted to that office; that they\r\nwere tribunes of the commons and not of the senators.\" But the commons\r\nhad risen with such violent determination, that the senators were\r\nobliged to extricate themselves from danger by the punishment of\r\none.[90] They resisted however, in spite of popular odium, and employed,\r\neach individual his own powers, and all those of the entire order. And\r\nfirst, the trial was made whether they could upset the affair, by\r\nposting their clients (in several places), by deterring individuals from\r\nattending meetings and cabals. Then they all proceeded in a body (you\r\nwould suppose that all the senators were on their trial) earnestly\r\nentreating the commons, that if they would not acquit as innocent, they\r\nwould at least pardon as guilty, one citizen, one senator. As he did not\r\nattend on the day appointed, they persevered in their resentment. Being\r\ncondemned in his absence, he went into exile to the Volsci, threatening\r\nhis country, and even then breathing all the resentment of an enemy. The\r\nVolsci received him kindly on his arrival, and treated him still more\r\nkindly every day in proportion as his resentful feelings towards his\r\ncountrymen became more striking, and one time frequent complaints,\r\nanother time threats were heard. He lodged with Attius Tullus. He was\r\nthen the chief man of the Volscian people, and always a determined\r\nenemy of the Romans. Thus, when old animosity stimulated the one, recent\r\nresentment the other, they concert schemes for (bringing about) a war\r\nwith Rome. They did not at once believe that their people could be\r\npersuaded to take up arms, so often unsuccessfully tried. That by the\r\nmany frequent wars, and lastly, by the loss of their youth in the\r\npestilence, their spirits were now broken; that they must have recourse\r\nto art, in a case where animosity had become blunted from length of\r\ntime, that their feelings might become exasperated by some fresh cause\r\nof resentment.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: i. e. the senate found themselves reduced to the necessity\r\nof delivering one up to the vengeance of the people, in order to save\r\nthemselves from the further consequences of plebeian rage.]\r\n\r\n36. It happened that preparations were being made at Rome for a\r\nrepetition of the [91]great games; the cause of repeating them was this:\r\non the morning of the games, the show not yet being commenced, a master\r\nof a family, after flogging his slave loaded with a neck-yoke, had\r\ndriven him through the middle of the circus; after this the games were\r\ncommenced, as if that circumstance bore no relation to religion. Not\r\nlong after it. Atinius, a plebeian, had a dream. Jupiter seemed to him\r\nto say; \"that the person who danced previous to the games had displeased\r\nhim; unless these games were renewed on a splendid scale, that the city\r\nwould be in danger; that he should go and announce these things to the\r\nconsuls.\" Though his mind was not altogether free from superstitious\r\nfeelings, his respectful awe of the dignity of the magistrates overcame\r\nhis religious fear, lest he might pass into the mouths of people as a\r\nlaughing-stock. This delay cost him dear; for he lost his son within a\r\nfew days; and lest the cause of this sudden calamity should be doubtful,\r\nthat same phantom, presenting itself to him sorrowful in mind, seemed to\r\nask him, whether he had received a sufficient requital for his contempt\r\nof the deity; that a still heavier one awaited him, unless he went\r\nimmediately and delivered the message to the consuls. The matter was now\r\nstill more pressing. Hesitating, however, and delaying he was at length\r\novertaken by a severe stroke of disease, a sudden paralysis. Then indeed\r\nthe anger of the gods aroused him. Wearied out therefore by his past\r\nsufferings and by those threatening him, having convened a meeting of\r\nhis friends, after he had detailed to them all he had seen and heard,\r\nand Jupiter's having so often presented himself to him in his sleep,\r\nthe threats and anger of heaven realized[92] in his own calamities, by\r\nthe unhesitating assent of all who were present he is conveyed in a\r\nlitter into the forum to the consuls; from thence being conveyed into\r\nthe senate-house, after he had stated those same particulars to the\r\nsenators, to the great surprise of all, behold another miracle: he who\r\nhad been conveyed into the senate-house deprived of the use of all his\r\nlimbs, is recorded to have returned home on his own feet after he\r\ndischarged his duty.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 91: The same as the Circenses.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: _Realized_--_repræsentatas_--quasi præsentes factas,\r\noculis subjectas--presented as it were to the sight.--_Rasch_.]\r\n\r\n37. The senate decreed that the games should be celebrated on as grand a\r\nscale as possible. To these games a great number of Volscians came by\r\nthe advice of Attius Tullus. Before the games were commenced, Tullus, as\r\nhad been concerted at home with Marcius, comes to the consuls. He tells\r\nthem that there were matters on which he wished to treat with them in\r\nprivate concerning the commonwealth. All witnesses being removed, he\r\nsays, \"With reluctance I say that of my countrymen which is rather\r\ndisparaging.[93] I do not however come to allege against them any thing\r\nas having been committed by them, but to guard against their committing\r\nany thing. The minds of our people are far more fickle than I could\r\nwish. We have felt that by many disasters; seeing that we are still\r\npreserved, not through our own deserts, but through your forbearance.\r\nThere is now here a great multitude of Volscians. The games are going\r\non; the city will be intent on the exhibition. I remember what has been\r\ncommitted in this city on a similar occasion by the youth of the\r\nSabines. My mind shudders lest any thing should be committed\r\ninconsiderately and rashly. I considered, that these matters should be\r\nmentioned before-hand to you, consuls. With regard to myself, it is my\r\ndetermination to depart hence home immediately, lest, if present, I may\r\nbe affected by the contagion of any word or deed.\" Having said this, he\r\ndeparted. When the consuls laid before the senate the matter, doubtful\r\nwith respect to proof, though from credible authority, the authority\r\nmore than the thing itself, as usually happens, urged them to adopt even\r\nneedless precautions; and a decree of the senate being passed, that the\r\nVolscians should quit the city, criers are sent in different directions\r\nto order them all to depart before night. A great panic struck them at\r\nfirst as they ran about to their lodgings to carry away their effects.\r\nAfterwards, when setting out, indignation arose in their breasts: \"that\r\nthey, as if polluted with crime and contaminated, were driven away from\r\nthe games, on festival days, from the converse in a manner of men and\r\ngods.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 93: _Sequius sit_--otherwise than as it should be.]\r\n\r\n38. As they went along in an almost continuous body, Tullus having\r\npreceded them to the fountain of Ferentina, accosting the chiefs among\r\nthem according as each arrived, by asking questions and expressing\r\nindignation, he led both themselves, who greedily listened to language\r\ncongenial[94] to their angry feelings, and through them the rest of the\r\nmultitude, into a plain adjoining to the road. There having commenced an\r\naddress after the manner of a public harangue, he says, \"Though you were\r\nto forget the former ill treatment of the Roman people and the\r\ncalamities of the nation of the Volsci, and all other such matters, with\r\nwhat feelings do you bear this outrage offered you to-day, whereon they\r\nhave commenced their games by insulting us? Have you not felt that a\r\ntriumph has been had over you this day? that you, when departing, were a\r\nspectacle to all, citizens, foreigners, so many neighbouring states?\r\nthat your wives, your children were exhibited before the eyes of men?\r\nWhat do you suppose to have been the sentiments of those who heard the\r\nvoice of the crier? what of those who saw you departing? what of those\r\nwho met this ignominious cavalcade? what, except that we are identified\r\nwith some enormous guilt by which we should profane the games, and\r\nrender an expiation necessary; that for this reason we are driven away\r\nfrom the residences of these pious people, from their converse and\r\nmeeting? what, does it not strike you that we still live because we\r\nhastened our departure? if this is a departure and not a flight. And do\r\nyou not consider this to be the city of enemies, where if you had\r\ndelayed a single day, you must have all died? War has been declared\r\nagainst you; to the heavy injury of those who declared it, if you are\r\nmen.\" Thus, being both already charged with resentment, and incited (by\r\nthis harangue) they went severally to their homes, and by instigating\r\neach his own state, they succeeded in making the entire Volscian nation\r\nrevolt.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 94: _Audientes secunda iræ verba_--attentively listening to\r\nwords which fanned (or chimed in with) their anger.--_St_.]\r\n\r\n39. The generals selected for that war by the unanimous choice of all\r\nthe states were Attius Tullus and Caius Marcius; in the latter of whom\r\ntheir chief hope was reposed. And this hope he by no means disappointed:\r\nso that it clearly appeared that the Roman commonwealth was more\r\npowerful by reason of its generals than its army. Having marched to\r\nCirceii, he expelled from thence the Roman colonists, and delivered that\r\ncity in a state of freedom to the Volscians. From thence passing across\r\nthe country through by-roads into the Latin way, he deprived the Romans\r\nof their recently acquired towns, Satricum, Longula, Polusca, Corioli.\r\nHe next retook Lavinium: he then took in succession Corbio, Vitellia,\r\nTrebia, Lavici, and Pedum: Lastly he marches from Pedum to the city,[95]\r\nand having pitched his camp at the Cluilian trenches five miles from the\r\ncity, he from thence ravages the Roman territory, guards being sent\r\namong the devastators to preserve the lands of the patricians intact;\r\nwhether as being incensed chiefly against the plebeians, or in order\r\nthat dissension might arise between the senators and the people. And\r\nthis certainly would have arisen, so powerfully did the tribunes, by\r\ninveighing against the leading men of the state, incite the plebeians,\r\nalready sufficiently violent of themselves; but their apprehensions of\r\nthe foe, the strongest bond of concord, united their minds, distrustful\r\nand rancorous though they were. The only matter not agreed on was this,\r\nthat the senate and consuls rested their hopes on nothing else than on\r\narms; the plebeians preferred any thing to war. Sp. Nautius and Sex.\r\nFurius were now consuls. Whilst they were reviewing the legions, posting\r\nguards along the walls and other places where they had determined that\r\nthere should be posts and watches, a vast multitude of persons\r\ndemanding peace terrified them first by their seditious clamour; then\r\ncompelled them to convene the senate, to consider the question of\r\nsending ambassadors to C. Marcius. The senate entertained the question,\r\nwhen it became evident that the spirits of the plebeians were giving\r\nway, and ambassadors being sent to Marcius concerning peace, brought\r\nback a harsh answer: \"If their lands were restored to the Volscians,\r\nthat they might then consider the question of peace; if they were\r\ndisposed to enjoy the plunder of war at their ease, that he, mindful\r\nboth of the injurious treatment of his countrymen, as well as of the\r\nkindness of strangers, would do his utmost to make it appear that his\r\nspirit was irritated by exile, not crushed.\" When the same persons are\r\nsent back a second time, they are not admitted into the camp. It is\r\nrecorded that the priests also, arrayed in their insignia, went as\r\nsuppliants to the enemy's camp; and that they did not influence his mind\r\nmore than the ambassadors.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 95: Scil. Rome. Dionysius narrates the expedition of\r\nCoriolanus in a different order from that given by Livy, and says that\r\nhe approached the city twice. Niebuhr, ii. p. 94, n. 535, thinks that\r\nthe words \"passing across the country into the Latin way\" (in Latinam\r\nviam transversis itineribus transgressus) have been transposed from\r\ntheir proper place, and that they should come in after \"he then took,\"\r\n&c. (tunc deinceps).]\r\n\r\n40. Then the matrons assemble in a body around Veturia, the mother of\r\nCoriolanus, and his wife, Volumnia: whether that was the result of\r\npublic counsel, or of the women's fear, I cannot ascertain. They\r\ncertainly carried their point that Veturia, a lady advanced in years,\r\nand Volumnia, leading her two sons by Marcius, should go into the camp\r\nof the enemy, and that women should defend by entreaties and tears a\r\ncity which men were unable to defend by arms. When they reached the\r\ncamp, and it was announced to Coriolanus, that a great body of women\r\nwere approaching, he, who had been moved neither by the majesty of the\r\nstate in its ambassadors, nor by the sanctity of religion so strikingly\r\naddressed to his eyes and understanding in its priests, was much more\r\nobdurate against the women's tears. Then one of his acquaintances, who\r\nrecognised Veturia, distinguished from all the others by her sadness,\r\nstanding between her daughter-in-law and grand-children, says, \"Unless\r\nmy eyes deceive me, your mother, children, and wife, are approaching.\"\r\nWhen Coriolanus, almost like one bewildered, rushing in consternation\r\nfrom his seat, offered to embrace his mother as she met him, the lady,\r\nturning from entreaties to angry rebuke, says, \"Before I receive your\r\nembrace, let me know whether I have come to an enemy or to a son;\r\nwhether I am in your camp a captive or a mother? Has length of life and\r\na hapless old age reserved me for this--to behold you an exile, then an\r\nenemy? Could you lay waste this land, which gave you birth and nurtured\r\nyou? Though you had come with an incensed and vengeful mind, did not\r\nyour resentment subside when you entered its frontiers? When Rome came\r\nwithin view, did it not occur to you, within these walls my house and\r\nguardian gods are, my mother, wife, and children? So then, had I not\r\nbeen a mother, Rome would not be besieged: had I not a son, I might have\r\ndied free in a free country. But I can now suffer nothing that is not\r\nmore discreditable to you than distressing to me; nor however wretched I\r\nmay be, shall I be so long. Look to these, whom, if you persist, either\r\nan untimely death or lengthened slavery awaits.\" Then his wife and\r\nchildren embraced him: and the lamentation proceeding from the entire\r\ncrowd of women, and their bemoaning themselves and their country, at\r\nlength overcame the man; then, after embracing his family, he sends them\r\naway; he moved his camp farther back from the city. Then, after he had\r\ndrawn off his troops from the Roman territory, they say that he lost his\r\nlife, overwhelmed by the odium of the proceeding: different writers say\r\nby different modes of death: I find in Fabius, far the most ancient\r\nwriter, that he lived even to old age; he states positively, that\r\nadvanced in years he made use of this phrase, \"That exile bore much\r\nheavier on the old man.\" The men of Rome were not remiss in awarding\r\ntheir praises to the women, so truly did they live without detracting\r\nfrom the merit of others; a temple was built also and dedicated to\r\nfemale Fortune, to serve as a monument. The Volscians afterwards\r\nreturned in conjunction with the Æqui into the Roman territory: but the\r\nÆqui would no longer have Attius Tullus as their leader; hence from\r\ndispute, whether the Volscians or the Æqui should give a general to the\r\nallied army, a sedition, and afterwards a furious battle arose. There\r\nthe good fortune of the Roman people destroyed the two armies of the\r\nenemy, by a contest no less bloody than obstinate. T. Sicinius and C.\r\nAquillius were made consuls. The Volsci fell as a province to Sicinius;\r\nthe Hernici (for they too were in arms) to Aquillius. That year the\r\nHernici were defeated; they came off with respect to the Volscians on\r\nequal terms.\r\n\r\n41. Sp. Cassius and Proculus Virginius were next made consuls; a treaty\r\nwas struck with the Hernici; two-thirds of their land were taken from\r\nthem: of this the consul Cassius was about to distribute one half among\r\nthe Latins, the other half among the commons. To this donation he was\r\nadding a considerable portion of land, which, though public property, he\r\nalleged was possessed by private individuals. This proceeding alarmed\r\nseveral of the senators, the actual possessors, at the danger of their\r\nproperty; the senators felt, moreover, a solicitude on public grounds,\r\nthat the consul by his donation was establishing an influence dangerous\r\nto liberty. Then, for the first time, the Agrarian law was proposed,\r\nwhich even down to our own recollection was never agitated without the\r\ngreatest commotions in the state. The other consul resisted the\r\ndonation, the senators seconding him, nor were all the commons opposed\r\nto him; they had at first begun to despise a gift which was extended\r\nfrom citizens to allies: in the next place they frequently heard the\r\nconsul Virginius in the assemblies as it were prophesying--\"that the\r\ngift of his colleague was pestilential--that those lands were sure to\r\nbring slavery to those who should receive them; that the way was paving\r\nto a throne.\" For why was it that the allies were included, and the\r\nLatin nation? What was the object of a third of the land that had been\r\ntaken being given back to the Hernici so lately our enemies, except that\r\ninstead of Coriolanus being their leader they may have Cassius? The\r\ndissuader and opposer of the agrarian law now began to be popular. Both\r\nconsuls then vied with each other in humouring the commons. Virginius\r\nsaid that he would suffer the lands to be assigned, provided they were\r\nassigned to no one but to a Roman citizen. Cassius, because in the\r\nagrarian donation he sought popularity among the allies, and was\r\ntherefore lowered in the estimation of his countrymen, in order that by\r\nanother donation he might conciliate their affections, ordered that the\r\nmoney received for the Sicilian corn should be refunded to the people.\r\nThat indeed the people rejected as nothing else than a present bribe for\r\nregal authority: so strongly were his gifts spurned in the minds of men,\r\nas if they possessed every thing in abundance, in consequence of their\r\ninveterate suspicions of his aiming at sovereign power. As soon as he\r\nwent out of office, it is certain that he was condemned and put to\r\ndeath. There are some who represent his father as the person who\r\ninflicted the punishment: that he, having tried him at home, scourged\r\nhim and put him to death, and consecrated his son's private property to\r\nCeres; that out of this a statue was set up and inscribed, \"given from\r\nthe Cassian family.\" In some authors I find it stated, and that is more\r\nprobable, that a day of trial was assigned him for high treason, by the\r\nquestors, Kæso Fabius and Lucius Valerius; and that he was condemned by\r\nthe decision of the people; that his house was demolished by a public\r\ndecree: this is the area before the temple of Tellus. But whether that\r\ntrial was private or public, he was condemned in the consulship of Ser.\r\nCornelius and Q. Fabius.\r\n\r\n42. The resentment of the people against Cassius was not of long\r\nduration. The allurements of the agrarian law, now that its proposer was\r\ngone, were of themselves gaining ground in their minds; and this feeling\r\nwas further heightened by the parsimonious conduct of the senators, who,\r\nthe Volsci and Æqui having been defeated that year, defrauded the\r\nsoldiers of the booty; whatever was taken from the enemy, the consul\r\nFabius sold, and lodged the proceeds in the treasury. The Fabian name\r\nwas odious to the commons on account of the last consul: the senate\r\nhowever succeeded in having Kæso Fabius elected consul with L. Æmilius.\r\nThe commons, still further incensed at this, stirred up foreign war by\r\nexciting disturbance at home; civil dissensions were then interrupted by\r\nwar. The senators and commons uniting, under the conduct of Æmilius,\r\nconquered in battle the Volsci and Æqui who renewed hostilities. The\r\nretreat, however, destroyed more of the enemy than the battle; so\r\nperseveringly did the horse pursue them when routed. During the same\r\nyear, on the ides of July, the temple of Castor was dedicated: it had\r\nbeen vowed during the Latin war in the dictatorship of Posthumius: his\r\nson, who was elected duumvir for that special purpose, dedicated it. In\r\nthat year also the minds of the people were excited by the charms of the\r\nagrarian law. The tribunes of the people were for enhancing the popular\r\npower (vested in them) by promoting the popular law. The senators,\r\nconsidering that there was enough and more than enough of frenzy in the\r\nmultitude without any additional incitement, viewed with horror\r\nlargesses and all inducements to temerity: the senators found in the\r\nconsuls most energetic abettors in making resistance. That portion of\r\nthe commonwealth therefore prevailed; and not for the present only, but\r\nfor the forthcoming year they succeeded in bringing in M. Fabius, Kæso's\r\nbrother, as consul, and one still more detested by the commons for his\r\npersecution of Sp. Cassius, L. Valerius. In that year also there was a\r\ncontest with the tribunes. The law proved to be a vain project, and the\r\nabettors of the law mere boasters, by their holding out a gift that was\r\nnot realized. The Fabian name was from thence held in high repute, after\r\nthree successive consulates, and all as it were uniformly exercised in\r\ncontending with the tribunes; accordingly, the honour remained for a\r\nconsiderable time in that family, as being right well placed. A\r\nVeientian war was then commenced; the Volscians, too, renewed\r\nhostilities; but for foreign wars their strength was almost more than\r\nsufficient, and they abused it by contending among themselves. To the\r\ndistracted state of the public mind were added prodigies from heaven,\r\nexhibiting almost daily threats in the city and in the country, and the\r\nsoothsayers, consulted by the state and by private individuals, one\r\nwhile by means of entrails, another by birds, declared that there was no\r\nother cause for the divine anger, but that the ceremonies of religion\r\nwere not duly attended to. These terrors, however, terminated in this,\r\nthat Oppia, a vestal virgin, being found guilty of a breach of chastity,\r\nwas made to suffer punishment.\r\n\r\n43. Quintus Fabius and C. Julius were then made consuls. During this\r\nyear the dissension at home was not abated, and the war abroad was more\r\ndesperate. Arms were taken up by the Æquans; the Veientes also entered\r\nthe territory of the Romans committing devastations; the solicitude\r\nabout which wars increasing, Kæso Fabius and Sp. Fusius are created\r\nconsuls. The Æqui were laying siege to Ortona, a Latin city. The\r\nVeientes, now satiated with plunder, threatened that they would besiege\r\nRome itself. Which terrors, when they ought to assuage, increased still\r\nfurther the bad feelings of the commons: and the custom of declining the\r\nmilitary service was now returning, not of their own accord; but Sp.\r\nLicinius, a tribune of the people, thinking that the time was come for\r\nforcing the agrarian law on the patricians by extreme necessity, had\r\ntaken on him the task of obstructing the military preparations. But all\r\nthe odium of the tribunitian power was turned on the author; nor did the\r\nconsuls rise up against him more zealously than his own colleagues; and\r\nby their assistance the consuls hold the levy. An army is raised for the\r\ntwo wars at the same time; one is given to Fabius to be led against the\r\nÆqui, the other to Furius against the Veientians. And with respect to\r\nthe Veientians, nothing was done worthy of mention. Fabius had much more\r\ntrouble with his countrymen than with the enemy: that one man himself,\r\nas consul, sustained the commonwealth, which the army was betraying, far\r\nas in them lay, through their hatred of the consul. For when the consul,\r\nin addition to his other military talents, which he exhibited amply in\r\nhis preparations for and conduct of war, had so drawn up his line that\r\nhe routed the enemy's army solely by a charge of his cavalry, the\r\ninfantry refused to pursue them when routed: and though the exhortation\r\nof their general, whom they hated, could not move them, neither could\r\neven their own infamy, and the present public disgrace and subsequent\r\ndanger, if the enemy should recover courage, oblige them to quicken\r\ntheir pace, or even to stand in order of battle, if nothing else.\r\nWithout orders they face about, and with a sorrowful air (you would\r\nsuppose them beaten) they return to the camp, execrating at one time\r\ntheir general, at another time the services rendered by the cavalry. Nor\r\nwere any remedies sought by the general for this so pestilent an\r\nexample; so true is it that the most distinguished talents are more\r\nlikely to be deficient in the tact of managing their countrymen than in\r\nthat of conquering an enemy. The consul returned to Rome, not having so\r\nmuch increased his military glory as irritated and exasperated the\r\nhatred of his soldiers towards him. The patricians, however, succeeded\r\nin having the consulship remain in the Fabian family. They elect M.\r\nFabius consul: Cn. Manlius is assigned as a colleague to Fabius.\r\n\r\n44. This year also had a tribune as a proposer of the agrarian law. It\r\nwas Titus Pontificius: he pursuing the same course, as if it had\r\nsucceeded with Sp. Licinius, obstructed the levy for a little time. The\r\npatricians being once more perplexed, Appius Claudius asserts \"that the\r\ntribunitian power was put down last year: for the present by the very\r\nact, for the future by the precedent established, and since it was found\r\nthat it could be rendered ineffective by its own strength; for that\r\nthere never would be wanting a tribune who would both be willing to\r\nobtain a victory for himself over his colleague, and the favour of the\r\nbetter party by advancing the public weal. That both a plurality of\r\ntribunes, if there were need of such plurality, would be ready to assist\r\nthe consuls; and that even one would be sufficient against all. Only let\r\nthe consuls and leading members of the senate take care to gain over, if\r\nnot all, at least some of the tribunes, to the commonwealth and the\r\nsenate.\" The senators, convinced by the counsels of Appius, both\r\ncollectively addressed the tribunes with kindness and civility, and the\r\nmen of consular rank, according as each possessed personal influence\r\nover them individually, partly by conciliation, partly by authority,\r\nprevailed so far as to make them consent that the powers of the\r\ntribunitian office should be beneficial to the state; and by the aid of\r\nfour tribunes against one obstructor of the public good, the consuls\r\ncomplete the levy. They then set out to the Veientian war, to which\r\nauxiliaries had flocked from all parts of Etruria, collected not so much\r\nfor the sake of the Veientians, as because they had formed a hope that\r\nthe Roman state might be destroyed by internal discord. And in the\r\ncouncils of all the states of Etruria the leading men openly stated,\r\n\"that the Roman power was eternal, unless they were distracted by\r\ndisturbances among themselves. That this was the only poison, this the\r\nbane discovered for powerful states, to render great empires mortal.\r\nThat this evil, a long time retarded, partly by the wise measures of the\r\npatricians, partly by the forbearance of the commons, had now proceeded\r\nto extremities. That two states were now formed out of one: that each\r\nparty had its own magistrates, its own laws. That though at first they\r\nwere accustomed to be turbulent during the levies, still that these same\r\nindividuals had ever been obedient to their commanders during war; that\r\nmilitary discipline being still retained, no matter what might be the\r\nstate of the city, it had been possible to withstand the evil; that now\r\nthe custom of not obeying their superior followed the Roman soldier even\r\nto the camp. That in the last war in the very field, in the very heat of\r\nbattle, by consent of the army the victory was voluntarily surrendered\r\nto the vanquished Æqui: that the standards were deserted, the general\r\nabandoned on the field, and that the army had returned to the camp\r\nwithout orders. That without doubt, if perseverance were used, Rome\r\nmight be conquered by her own soldiery. That nothing else was necessary\r\nthan to declare and make a show of war: that the fates and the gods\r\nwould of themselves manage the rest.\" These hopes had armed the\r\nEtrurians, who in many vicissitudes had been vanquished and victors.\r\n\r\n45. The Roman consuls also dreaded nothing else, than their own\r\nstrength, and their own arms. The recollection of the destructive\r\nprecedent set in the last war, deterred them from bringing matters to\r\nsuch a pass as that they should have to fear two armies at the same\r\ntime. Accordingly they kept within their camp, avoiding this double\r\ndanger: \"that delay and time itself would soften down resentment, and\r\nbring a right way of thinking to their minds.\" The Veientian enemy and\r\nthe Etrurians proceeded with so much the greater precipitation; they\r\nprovoked them to battle, first riding up to the camp and challenging\r\nthem; at length, when they produced no effect by reviling as well the\r\nconsuls themselves as the army, they stated, \"that the pretence of\r\ninternal dissension was assumed as a cloak for this cowardice; and that\r\nthe consuls distrusted as much the courage as the obedience of their\r\nsoldiers. That silence and inaction among men in arms were a novel form\r\nof sedition.\" Besides this they threw out reproaches, both true as well\r\nas false, on the upstart quality of their race and origin. Whilst they\r\nvociferated these reproaches beneath the very rampart and gates, the\r\nconsuls bore them without impatience: but at one time indignation, at\r\nanother time shame, distracted the breasts of the ignorant multitude,\r\nand diverted their attention from intestine evils; they were unwilling\r\nthat the enemy should come off unpunished; they were unwilling that\r\nsuccess should accrue to the patricians or the consuls; foreign and\r\ndomestic hatred struggled for mastery in their breasts; at length the\r\nformer prevail, so haughtily and insolently did the enemy revile them;\r\nthey crowd in a body to the general's tent; they demand battle, they\r\nrequire that the signal be given. The consuls confer together as if to\r\ndeliberate; they continue the conference for a long time; they were\r\ndesirous of fighting, but that desire must be checked and concealed,\r\nthat by opposition and delay they might increase the ardour of the\r\nsoldiery once roused. An answer is returned, \"that the matter in\r\nquestion was premature, that it was not yet time for fighting: that they\r\nshould keep within their camp.\" They then issue a proclamation, \"that\r\nthey should abstain from fighting; that if any one fought without\r\norders, they should punish him as an enemy.\" When they were thus\r\ndismissed, their eagerness for fighting increases in proportion as they\r\nthink that the consuls were less disposed for it; the enemies moreover\r\ncome up much more insolently, as soon as it was known that the consuls\r\nhad determined not to fight. For they supposed \"that they might insult\r\nthem with impunity; that their arms were not intrusted to the soldiery.\r\nThat the matter would explode in a violent mutiny; that a termination\r\nhad come to the Roman empire.\" Relying on these hopes, they run up to\r\nthe gates, heap reproaches on them, with difficulty refrain from\r\nassaulting the camp. Now indeed the Romans could no longer endure these\r\ninsults; they crowd from every quarter of the camp to the consuls: they\r\nno longer, as formerly, make their demand with reserve, through the\r\nmediation of the centurions of the first rank; but all proceed\r\nindiscriminately with loud clamours. The affair was now ripe; still they\r\nput it off. Fabius then, his colleague giving way in consequence of his\r\ndread of mutiny being now augmented by the uproar, after he had\r\ncommanded silence by sound of trumpet, says, \"that these men are able to\r\nconquer, Cneius Manlius, I know; that they are willing they themselves\r\nhave prevented me from knowing. It is therefore resolved and determined\r\nnot to give the signal, unless they swear that they will return\r\nvictorious from this battle. The soldier has once deceived the Roman\r\nconsul in the field, the gods he never will deceive.\" There was a\r\ncenturion, Marcus Flavoleius, one of the foremost in demanding battle;\r\nhe says, \"M. Fabius, I will return victorious from the field.\" If he\r\ndeceived, he invokes the anger of father Jove, Mars Gradivus, and of the\r\nother gods. After him the entire army severally take the same oath. The\r\nsignal is given to them when sworn; they take up arms, go into battle,\r\nfull of rage and of hope. They bid the Etrurians now to cast their\r\nreproaches; they severally require that the enemy, once so ready with\r\nthe tongue, should now stand before them armed as they were. On that day\r\nthe bravery of all, both commons and patricians, was extraordinary: the\r\nFabian name, the Fabian race shone forth most conspicuous: they are\r\ndetermined to recover in that battle the affections of the commons,\r\nwhich during many civil contests had been alienated from them. The line\r\nof battle is formed; nor do the Veientian foe and the Etrurian legions\r\ndecline the contest.\r\n\r\n46. An almost certain hope was entertained that they would no more fight\r\nwith them than they had done with the Æqui; that even some more serious\r\nattempt was not to be despaired of, considering the irritated state of\r\ntheir feelings, and the very critical occasion. The affair turned out\r\naltogether differently; for never before in any other war did the Roman\r\nsoldiers enter the field with more determined minds (so much had the\r\nenemy exasperated them by taunts on the one hand, and the consuls by\r\ndelay on the other). The Etrurians had scarcely time to form their\r\nranks, when the javelins having been thrown away at random, in the first\r\nhurry, rather than discharged with aim, the battle had now come to close\r\nfighting, even to swords, where the fury of war is most desperate. Among\r\nthe foremost the Fabian family was distinguished for the sight it\r\nafforded and the example it presented to their fellow citizens; one of\r\nthese, Q. Fabius, (he had been consul two years before,) as he was\r\nadvancing at the head of his men against a dense body of Veientians, and\r\nwhilst engaged amid numerous parties of the enemy, and therefore not\r\nprepared for it, was transfixed with a sword through the breast by a\r\nTuscan who presumed on his bodily strength and skill in arms: on the\r\nweapon being extracted, Fabius fell forward on the wound. Both armies\r\nfelt the fall of this one man, and the Roman began in consequence to\r\ngive way, when the consul Marcus Fabius leaped over the body as it lay,\r\nand holding up his buckler, said, \"Is this what you swore, soldiers,\r\nthat you would return to the camp in flight? are you thus more afraid of\r\nyour most dastardly enemies, than of Jupiter and Mars, by whom you have\r\nsworn? But I who have not sworn will either return victorious, or will\r\nfall fighting here beside thee, Q. Fabius.\" Then Kæso Fabius, the consul\r\nof the preceding year, says to the consul, \"Brother, is it by these\r\nwords you think you will prevail on them to fight? the gods by whom they\r\nhave sworn will prevail on them. Let us also, as men of noble birth, as\r\nis worthy of the Fabian name, enkindle the courage of the soldiers by\r\nfighting rather than by exhorting.\" Thus the two Fabii rush forward to\r\nthe front with presented spears, and brought on with them the whole\r\nline.\r\n\r\n47. The battle being restored on one side, Cn. Manlius, the consul, with\r\nno less ardour, encouraged the fight on the other wing. Where an almost\r\nsimilar result took place; for as the soldiers undauntedly followed Q.\r\nFabius on the one wing, so did they follow Manlius on this, as he was\r\ndriving the enemy now nearly routed, and when he, having received a\r\nsevere wound, retired from the battle, they fell back, supposing that he\r\nwas slain, and would have given way, had not the other consul, galloping\r\nat full speed to that quarter with some troops of horse, supported their\r\ndrooping energies, crying out that his colleague was still alive, that\r\nhe himself was now come victorious, having routed the other wing.\r\nManlius also shows himself to restore the battle. The well-known voices\r\nof the two consuls rekindle the courage of the soldiers; at the same\r\ntime too the enemy's line was now weakened, whilst, relying on their\r\nsuperior numbers, they draw off their reserve and send them to storm the\r\ncamp. This being assaulted without much resistance, whilst they lose\r\ntime in attending to plunder rather than to fighting, the Roman\r\ntriarii,[96] who had not been able to sustain the first shock, having\r\nsent an account to the consuls of the present position of affairs,\r\nreturn in a compact body to the Prætorium, and of themselves renew the\r\nbattle. The consul Manlius also having returned to the camp, and posted\r\nsoldiers at all the gates, had blocked up every passage against the\r\nenemy. This desperate situation aroused the fury rather than the bravery\r\nof the Etrurians; for when rushing on wherever hope held out the\r\nprospect of escape, they had frequently advanced with fruitless efforts;\r\none body of young men makes an attack on the consul himself, conspicuous\r\nfrom his arms. The first weapons were intercepted by those who stood\r\naround him; afterwards their force could not be sustained. The consul\r\nfalls, having received a mortal wound, and all around him are dispersed.\r\nThe courage of the Etrurians rises. Terror drives the Romans in dismay\r\nthrough the entire camp; and matters would have come to extremities, had\r\nnot the lieutenant-generals, hastily seizing the body of the consul,\r\nopened a passage for the enemy at one gate. Through this they rush out;\r\nand going away in the utmost disorder, they fall in with the other\r\nconsul who had been victorious; there again they are slain and routed in\r\nevery direction. A glorious victory was obtained, saddened however by\r\ntwo so illustrious deaths. The consul, therefore, on the senate voting\r\nhim a triumph, replied, that \"if the army could triumph without their\r\ngeneral, he would readily accede to it in consideration of their\r\ndistinguished behaviour in that war: that for his own part, his family\r\nbeing plunged in grief in consequence of the death of his brother Q.\r\nFabius, and the commonwealth being in some degree bereaved by the loss\r\nof one of her consuls, he would not accept the laurel blasted by public\r\nand private grief.\" The triumph thus resigned was more distinguished\r\nthan any triumph actually enjoyed; so true it is, that glory refused in\r\ndue season sometimes returns with accumulated lustre. He next celebrates\r\nthe two funerals of his colleague and brother, one after the other, he\r\nhimself acting as panegyrist in the case of both, when by ascribing to\r\nthem his own deserts, he himself obtained the greatest share of them.\r\nAnd not unmindful of that which he had conceived at the commencement of\r\nhis consulate, namely, the regaining the affection of the people, he\r\ndistributes the wounded soldiers among the patricians to be cured. Most\r\nof them were given to the Fabii: nor were they treated with greater\r\nattention in any other place. From this time the Fabii began to be\r\npopular, and that not by any practices except such as were beneficial to\r\nthe state.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96: The triarii were veteran soldiers of approved valour: they\r\nformed the third line, whence their name.]\r\n\r\n48. Accordingly Kæso Fabius, having been elected consul with T.\r\nVirginius not more with the zealous wishes of the senators than of the\r\ncommons, attended neither to wars, nor levies, nor any other object,\r\nuntil the hope of concord being now in some measure commenced, the\r\nfeelings of the commons might be consolidated with those of the senators\r\nas soon as possible. Wherefore at the commencement of the year he\r\nproposed: \"that before any tribune should stand forth as an abettor of\r\nthe agrarian law, the patricians themselves should be beforehand with\r\nthem in performing their duty; that they should distribute among the\r\ncommons the land taken from the enemy in as equal a proportion as\r\npossible; that it was but just that those should obtain it, by whose\r\nblood and sweat it was obtained.\" The patricians rejected the proposal\r\nwith scorn; some even complained that the once brilliant talents of Kæso\r\nwere now becoming wanton, and were waning through excess of glory. There\r\nwere afterwards no factions in the city. The Latins were harassed by the\r\nincursions of the Æqui. Kæso being sent thither with an army, passes\r\ninto the very territory of the Æqui to depopulate it. The Æqui retired\r\ninto the towns, and kept themselves within the walls: on that account no\r\nbattle worth mentioning was fought. But a blow was received from the\r\nVeientian foe through the temerity of the other consul; and the army\r\nwould have been all cut off, had not Kæso Fabius come to their\r\nassistance in time. From that time there was neither peace nor war with\r\nthe Veientians; their proceedings had now come very near to the form of\r\nthat of brigands. They retired from the Roman troops into the city; when\r\nthey perceived that the troops were drawn off, they made incursions into\r\nthe country, alternately evading war by quiet, quiet by war. Thus the\r\nmatter could neither be dropped altogether, nor brought to a conclusion;\r\nand other wars were impending either at the moment, as from the Æqui and\r\nVolsci, who remained inactive no longer than until the recent smart of\r\ntheir late disaster should pass away; or it was evident that the\r\nSabines, ever hostile, and all Etruria would put themselves in motion:\r\nbut the Veientians, a constant rather than a formidable enemy, kept\r\ntheir minds in constant uneasiness by their insults more frequently than\r\nby any danger apprehended from them; a matter which could at no time be\r\nneglected, and which suffered them not to direct their attention to any\r\nother object. Then the Fabian family addressed the senate; the consul\r\nspeaks in the name of the family: \"Conscript fathers, the Veientian war\r\nrequires, as you know, a constant rather than a strong force. Do you\r\nattend to other wars: assign the Fabii as enemies to the Veientians. We\r\npledge ourselves that the majesty of the Roman name shall be safe in\r\nthat quarter. That war, as the property of our family, it is our\r\ndetermination to conduct at our own private expense. Let the republic be\r\nspared the expense of soldiers and money there.\" The warmest thanks were\r\nreturned to them. The consul, leaving the senate-house, accompanied by\r\nthe Fabii in a body, who had been standing in the porch of the\r\nsenate-house, returned home. Being ordered to attend on the following\r\nday in arms at the consul's gate, they retire to their homes.\r\n\r\n49. The rumour spreads through the entire city; they extol the Fabii to\r\nthe skies by their encomiums. \"That a single family had taken on them\r\nthe burden of the state: that the Veientian war had now become a private\r\nconcern, a private quarrel. If there were two families of the same\r\nstrength in the city, let them demand, the one the Volsci for itself,\r\nthe other the Æqui; that all the neighbouring states might be subdued,\r\nthe Roman people all the time enjoying profound peace.\" The day\r\nfollowing, the Fabii take up arms; they assemble where they had been\r\nordered. The consul coming forth in his paludamentum,[97] beholds his\r\nentire family in the porch drawn up in order of march; being received\r\ninto the centre, he orders the standards to be carried forward. Never\r\ndid an army march through the city, either smaller in number, or more\r\ndistinguished in fame and in the admiration of all men. Three hundred\r\nand six soldiers, all patricians, all of the one stock, not one of whom\r\nthe senate would reject as a leader in its palmiest days, proceeded on\r\ntheir march, menacing destruction to the Veientian state by the prowess\r\nof a single family. A crowd followed, partly belonging to their kinsmen\r\nand friends, who contemplated in mind no moderation either as to their\r\nhopes or anxiety, but every thing on the highest scale; partly\r\nconsisting of individuals not connected with their family, aroused by\r\nsolicitude for the public weal, all enraptured with esteem and\r\nadmiration. They bid them \"proceed in the brave resolve, proceed with\r\nhappy omens, bring back results proportioned to their undertaking:\r\nthence to expect consulships and triumphs, all rewards, all honours from\r\nthem.\" As they passed the Capitol and the citadel, and the other sacred\r\nedifices, they offer up prayers to all the gods that presented\r\nthemselves to their sight, or to their mind: that \"they would send\r\nforward that band with prosperity and success, and soon send them back\r\nsafe into their country to their parents.\" In vain were these prayers\r\nsent up. Having set out on their luckless road by the right-hand postern\r\nof the Carmental gate, they arrive at the river Cremera: this appeared\r\na favourable situation for fortifying a post. L. Æmilius and C.\r\nServilius were then created consuls. And as long as there was nothing\r\nelse to occupy them but mutual devastations, the Fabii were not only\r\nsufficiently able to protect their garrison, but through the entire\r\ntract, as far as the Etrurian joins the Roman territory, they protected\r\nall their own districts and ravaged those of the enemy, spreading their\r\nforces along both frontiers. There was afterwards an intermission,\r\nthough not of long duration, to these depredations: whilst both the\r\nVeientians, having sent for an army from Etruria, assault the post at\r\nthe Cremera, and the Roman troops, led thither by L. Æmilius the consul,\r\ncome to a close engagement in the field with the Etrurians; although the\r\nVeientians had scarcely time to draw up their line: for during the first\r\nalarm, whilst the ranks are posting themselves behind their respective\r\nbanners and they are stationing their reserves, a brigade of Roman\r\ncavalry charging them suddenly in flank, took away all opportunity not\r\nonly of commencing the fight, but even of standing their ground. Thus\r\nbeing driven back to the Red Rocks, (there they pitched their camp,)\r\nthey suppliantly sue for peace; for the obtaining of which they were\r\nsorry, from the natural inconsistency of their minds, before the Roman\r\ngarrison was drawn off from the Cremera.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: Before a consul set out on any expedition, he offered\r\nsacrifices and prayers in the Capitol; and then, laying aside his\r\nconsular gown, marched out of the city, dressed in a military robe of\r\nstate, called Paludamentum.]\r\n\r\n50. Again the Veientian state had to contend with the Fabii without any\r\nadditional military armament [on either side]; and there were not merely\r\nincursions into each other's territories, or sudden attacks on those\r\nmaking the incursions, but they fought repeatedly in the open field, and\r\nin pitched battles: and one family of the Roman people oftentimes gained\r\nthe victory over an entire Etrurian state, one of the most powerful at\r\nthat time. This at first appeared mortifying and humiliating to the\r\nVeientians: then (they formed) a design, suggested by the circumstance,\r\nof surprising their daring enemy by an ambuscade; they were even glad\r\nthat the confidence of the Fabii was increasing by their great success.\r\nWherefore cattle were frequently driven in the way of the plundering\r\nparties, as if they had come there by mere accident, and tracts of land\r\nwere abandoned by the flight of the peasants; and troops of armed men\r\nsent to prevent the devastations retreated more frequently from\r\npretended than from real fear. And now the Fabii had such a contempt for\r\nthe enemy, as to believe that their invincible arms could not be\r\nwithstood either in any place or on any occasion: this presumption\r\ncarried them so far, that at the sight of some cattle at a distance from\r\nCremera, with an extensive plain lying between, they ran down to it\r\n(although few troops of the enemy were observed); and when incautious\r\nand in disorderly haste they had passed the ambuscade placed on either\r\nside of the very road; and when dispersed in different directions they\r\nbegan to carry off the cattle straying about, as is usual when they are\r\nfrightened, the Veientians rise up suddenly from their ambuscade, and\r\nthe enemy were in front and on every side. At first the shout that was\r\nraised terrified them; then weapons assailed them from every side; and,\r\nthe Etrurians closing, they also were compelled, hemmed in as they now\r\nwere by a compact body of soldiers, to contract their own circle within\r\na narrower compass; which circumstance rendered striking both their own\r\npaucity of numbers, and the superior numbers of the enemy, the ranks\r\nbeing crowded in a narrow space. Then the plan of fighting, which they\r\nhad directed equally against every part, being now relinquished, they\r\nall incline their forces towards one point; in that direction straining\r\nevery effort both with their bodies and arms, they forced a passage by\r\nforming a wedge. The way led to a hill of moderate acclivity; here they\r\nfirst halted: presently, as soon as the higher ground afforded them time\r\nto gain breath, and to recover from so great a panic, they repulsed them\r\nas they advanced up; and the small band by the advantage of the ground\r\nwas gaining the victory, had not a party of the Veientians, sent round\r\nthe ridge of the hill, made their way to the summit; thus again the\r\nenemy obtained the higher ground; all the Fabii were killed to a man,\r\nand the fort was taken: it is agreed on all hands that the three hundred\r\nand six were cut off; that one[98] only, who nearly attained the age of\r\npuberty, was left as a stock for the Fabian race; and that he was\r\ndestined to prove the greatest support in the dangerous emergencies of\r\nthe Roman people both at home and in war.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98: This statement is rejected by Niebuhr entirely.]\r\n\r\n51. At the time when this disaster was received, C. Horatius and T.\r\nMenenius were consuls. Menenius was immediately sent against the\r\nEtrurians, elated with victory. Then too an unsuccessful battle was\r\nfought, and the enemy took possession of the Janiculum: and the city\r\nwould have been besieged, scarcity of provisions bearing hard upon them\r\nin addition to the war, (for the Etrurians had passed the Tiber,) had\r\nnot the consul Horatius been recalled from the Volsci; and so closely\r\ndid that war approach the very walls, that the first battle was fought\r\nnear the temple of Hope with doubtful success, and a second time at the\r\nColline gate. There, although the Romans had the advantage in a slight\r\ndegree only, yet that contest rendered the soldiers better for future\r\nbattles by restoring to them their former courage. Aulus Virginius and\r\nSp. Servilius are created consuls. After the defeat sustained in the\r\nlast battle, the Veientians declined an engagement. Ravages were\r\ncommitted, and they made incursions in every direction on the Roman\r\nterritory from the Janiculum as if from a fortress; no where were the\r\ncattle or the husbandmen safe. They were afterwards entrapped by the\r\nsame stratagem as that by which they had entrapped the Fabii: having\r\npursued some cattle that had been driven on designedly for the purpose\r\nof decoying them, they fell into an ambuscade; in proportion as they\r\nwere more numerous, the slaughter was greater. The violent resentment\r\nresulting from this disaster was the cause and commencement of one still\r\ngreater: for having crossed the Tiber by night, they attempted to\r\nassault the camp of the consul Servilius; being repulsed from thence\r\nwith great slaughter, they with difficulty made good their retreat into\r\nthe Janiculum. The consul himself also crosses the Tiber, fortifies his\r\ncamp at the foot of the Janiculum: at break of day on the following\r\nmorning, both from being somewhat elated by the success of the battle of\r\nthe day before, more however because the scarcity of corn forced him\r\ninto measures which, though dangerous, (he adopted) because they were\r\nmore expeditious, he rashly marched his army up the steep of the\r\nJaniculum to the camp of the enemy, and being repulsed from thence with\r\nmore disgrace than he had repulsed them on the preceding day, he was\r\nsaved, both himself and his army, by the intervention of his colleague.\r\nThe Etrurians (hemmed in) between the two armies, when they presented\r\ntheir rear to the one and the other by turns, were entirely cut off.\r\nThus the Veientian war was crushed by a fortunate act of temerity.\r\n\r\n52. Together with the peace, provisions returned to the city in greater\r\nabundance, both by reason of corn having been brought in from Campania,\r\nand, as soon as the fear felt by each of future famine left them, that\r\ncorn being brought forward which had been hoarded up. Then their minds\r\nonce more became licentious from their present abundance and ease, and\r\ntheir former subjects of complaint, now that there were none abroad,\r\nthey sought for at home; the tribunes began to excite the commons by\r\ntheir poison, the agrarian law: they roused them against the senators\r\nwho opposed it, and not only against them as a body, but also against\r\nparticular individuals. Q. Considius and T. Genucius, the proposers of\r\nthe agrarian law, appoint a day of trial for T. Menenius: the loss of\r\nthe fort of Cremera, whilst the consul had his standing camp at no great\r\ndistance from thence, was the charge against him. They crushed him,\r\nthough both the senators had exerted themselves in his behalf with no\r\nless earnestness than in behalf of Coriolanus, and the popularity of his\r\nfather Agrippa was not yet forgotten. The tribunes, however, went no\r\nfurther than a fine: though they had arraigned him for a capital\r\noffence, they imposed on him, when found guilty, a fine of two thousand\r\n_asses_. This proved fatal. They say that he could not submit to the\r\ndisgrace, and to the anguish of mind (occasioned by it): that, in\r\nconsequence, he was taken off by disease. Another senator, Sp.\r\nServilius, being soon after arraigned, as soon as he went out of office,\r\na day of trial having been appointed for him by the tribunes, L.\r\nCædicius and T. Statius, at the very commencement of the year, in the\r\nconsulship of C. Nautius and P. Valerius, did not, like Menenius, meet\r\nthe attacks of the tribunes with supplications from himself and the\r\npatricians, but with firm reliance on his own integrity, and his\r\npersonal influence. The battle with the Etrurians at the Janiculum was\r\nthe charge against him also: but being a man of an intrepid spirit, as\r\nhe had formerly acted in the case of public peril, so now in that which\r\nwas personal to himself, he dispelled the danger by boldly facing it, by\r\nconfuting not only the tribunes but the commons also, by a bold speech,\r\nand upbraiding them with the condemnation and death of T. Menenius, by\r\nthe good offices of whose father the commons were formerly\r\nre-established, and were now in possession of those laws and those\r\nmagistrates, by means of which they then exercised their insolence; his\r\ncolleague Virginius also, who was brought forward as a witness, aided\r\nhim by assigning to him a share of his own deserts; the condemnation of\r\nMenenius however was of greater service to him (so much had they changed\r\ntheir minds).\r\n\r\n53. The contests at home were now concluded. A Veientian war broke out,\r\nwith whom the Sabines had united their forces. The consul P. Valerius,\r\nafter auxiliaries were sent for from the Latins and Hernicians, being\r\ndespatched to Veii with an army, immediately attacks the Sabine camp,\r\nwhich had been pitched before the walls of their allies: and occasioned\r\nsuch great consternation, that while, dispersed in different directions,\r\nthey sally forth to repel the assault of the enemy, the gate which the\r\nRomans first attacked was taken; then within the rampart there was\r\nrather a carnage than a battle. From the camp the alarm spreads into the\r\ncity; the Veientians run to arms in as great a panic as if Veii had been\r\ntaken: some come up to the support of the Sabines, others fall upon the\r\nRomans, who had directed all their force against the camp. For a little\r\nwhile they were disconcerted and thrown into confusion; then they too\r\nforming two fronts make a stand: and the cavalry, being commanded by the\r\nconsul to charge, routs the Etrurians and puts them to flight; and in\r\nthe same hour two armies and two of the most influential and powerful of\r\nthe neighbouring states were vanquished. Whilst these transactions are\r\ngoing on at Veii, the Volsci and Æqui had pitched their camp in the\r\nLatin territory, and laid waste their frontiers. The Latins, by their\r\nown exertions, being joined by the Hernicians, without either a Roman\r\ngeneral or Roman auxiliaries, stripped them of their camp. Besides\r\nrecovering their own effects, they obtained immense booty. The consul C.\r\nNautius, however, was sent against the Volsci from Rome. The custom, I\r\nsuppose, was not pleasing for allies to carry on wars with their own\r\nforces and under their own direction without a Roman general and troops.\r\nThere was no kind of injury or indignity that was not practised against\r\nthe Volsci; nor could they be prevailed on however to come to an\r\nengagement in the field.\r\n\r\n54. Lucius Furius and Caius Manlius were the next consuls. The\r\nVeientians fell to Manlius as his province. War however did not take\r\nplace: a truce for forty years was granted them at their request, corn\r\nand pay for the soldiers being demanded of them. Disturbance at home\r\nimmediately succeeds to peace abroad: the commons were goaded by the\r\ntribunes with the excitement of the agrarian law. The consuls, nothing\r\nintimidated by the condemnation of Menenius, nor by the danger of\r\nServilius, resist with their utmost might; Cn. Genucius, a tribune of\r\nthe people, arraigned the consuls on their going out of office. Lucius\r\nÆmilius and Opiter Virginius enter on the consulate. Instead of\r\nVirginius I find Vopiscus Julius consul in some annals. In this year\r\n(whatever consuls it had) Furius and Manlius, being summoned to trial\r\nbefore the people, go about in suppliant garb not more to the commons\r\nthan to the younger patricians; they advise, they caution them \"to keep\r\nthemselves from honours and the administration of public affairs, and\r\nthat they would consider the consular fasces, the prætexta and curule\r\nchair, as nothing else than the decorations of a funeral; that when\r\ncovered with these fine insignia, as with fillets, they were doomed to\r\ndeath. But if the charms of the consulate were so great, they should\r\nrest satisfied that the consulate was held in captivity and crushed by\r\nthe tribunitian power; that every thing was to be done at the nod and\r\ncommand of the tribune by the consul, as if he were a tribune's beadle.\r\nIf he stir, if he have reference to the patricians, if he should think\r\nfor a moment that there existed any other party in the state but the\r\ncommons, let him place before his eyes the banishment of Caius Marcius,\r\nthe condemnation and death of Menenius.\" Fired by these discourses, the\r\npatricians from that time held their consultations not in public, but in\r\nprivate, and withdrawn from the knowledge of the many; where when this\r\none point was agreed on, that the accused must be rescued whether by\r\njust or unjust means, every proposition that was most desperate was most\r\napproved; nor was an actor wanted for any deed however daring.\r\nAccordingly on the day of trial, when the people stood in the forum in\r\nanxious expectation, they at first began to feel surprised that the\r\ntribune did not come down; then when the delay was now becoming more\r\nsuspicious, they considered that he was deterred by the nobles, and they\r\ncomplained that the public cause was abandoned and betrayed. At length\r\nthose who had been waiting before the gate of the tribune's residence,\r\nbring word that he was found dead in his house. As soon as rumour spread\r\nthis through the whole assembly, just as an army disperses on the fall\r\nof its general, so did they separate in different directions. The\r\nprincipal panic seized the tribunes, now warned by their colleague's\r\ndeath what little aid the devoting laws afforded them. Nor did the\r\npatricians bear their joy with sufficient moderation; and so far was any\r\nof them from feeling compunction at the guilty act, that even those who\r\nwere innocent wished to be considered to have perpetrated it, and it was\r\nopenly declared that the tribunitian power should be subdued by\r\nchastisement.\r\n\r\n55. Immediately after this victory of a most ruinous precedent a levy is\r\nproclaimed; and the tribunes being now overawed, the consuls accomplish\r\nthe matter without any opposition. Then indeed the commons became\r\nenraged more on account of the silence of the tribunes than the command\r\nof the consuls: and they said \"there was an end of their liberty; that\r\nthey were come back again to the old condition of things; that the\r\ntribunitian power had died along with Genucius and was buried with him;\r\nthat other means must be devised and practised, by which to resist the\r\npatricians; and that the only method for that was that the people should\r\ndefend themselves, since they now had no other aid. That four-and-twenty\r\nlictors waited on the consuls; and that these very individuals were from\r\namong the commons; that nothing could be more despicable, nor weaker, if\r\nthere were only persons who could despise them; that each person\r\nmagnified those things and made them objects of terror to himself.\" When\r\nthey had excited each other by these discourses, a lictor was despatched\r\nby the consuls to Volero Publilius, a man belonging to the commons,\r\nbecause he stated, that having been a centurion he ought not to be made\r\na common soldier. Volero appeals to the tribunes. When one came to his\r\nassistance, the consuls order the man to be stripped and the rods to be\r\ngot ready. \"I appeal to the people,\" says Volero, \"since tribunes had\r\nrather see a Roman citizen scourged before their eyes, than themselves\r\nbe butchered by you in their bed.\" The more vehemently he cried out, the\r\nmore violently did the lictor tear off his clothes and strip him. Then\r\nVolero, being both himself of great bodily strength, and being aided by\r\nhis partisans, having repulsed the lictor, when the shouts of those\r\nindignant in his behalf became very intense, betook himself into the\r\nthickest part of the crowd, crying out, \"I appeal, and implore the\r\nprotection of the commons; assist me, fellow citizens; assist me, fellow\r\nsoldiers; there is no use in waiting for the tribunes, who themselves\r\nstand in need of your aid.\" The men, being much excited, prepare as it\r\nwere for battle; and it became manifest that there was urgent danger,\r\nthat nothing would be held sacred by any one, that there would no longer\r\nexist any public or private right. When the consuls faced this so\r\nviolent storm, they soon experienced that majesty without strength had\r\nbut little security; the lictors being maltreated, the fasces broken,\r\nthey are driven from the forum into the senate-house, uncertain how far\r\nVolero would push his victory. After that, the disturbance subsiding,\r\nwhen they had ordered the senate to be convened, they complain of the\r\noutrages committed on themselves, of the violence of the people, the\r\ndaring of Volero. Many violent measures having been proposed, the elder\r\nmembers prevailed, who recommended that the unthinking rashness of the\r\ncommons should not be met by the passionate resentment of the\r\npatricians.\r\n\r\n56. The commons having espoused the interest of Volero, with great\r\nwarmth choose him, at the next election, tribune of the people for that\r\nyear, which had Lucius Pinarius and Publius Furius for consuls; and,\r\ncontrary to the opinion of all men, who thought that he would let loose\r\nhis tribuneship in harassing the consuls of the preceding year,\r\npostponing private resentment to the public interest, without assailing\r\nthe consuls even by a single word, he proposed a law to the people that\r\nplebeian magistrates should be elected at the comitia by tribes. A\r\nmatter of no trifling moment was now being brought forward, under an\r\naspect at first sight by no means alarming; but one which in reality\r\ndeprived the patricians of all power to elect whatever tribunes they\r\npleased by the suffrages of their clients. The patricians used all their\r\nenergies in resisting this proposition, which was most pleasing to the\r\ncommons; and though none of the college could be induced by the\r\ninfluence either of the consuls or of the chief members of the senate to\r\nenter a protest against it, the only means of resistance which now\r\nexisted; yet the matter, important as it was by its own weight, is spun\r\nout by contention till the following year. The commons re-elect Volero\r\nas tribune. The senators, considering that the question would be carried\r\nto the very extreme of a struggle, elect to the consulate Appius\r\nClaudius, the son of Appius, who was both hated by and hated the\r\ncommons, ever since the contests between them and his father. Titus\r\nQuintius is assigned to him as his colleague. In the very commencement\r\nof the year no other question took precedence of that regarding the law.\r\nBut though Volero was the inventor of it, his colleague, Lætorius, was\r\nboth a more recent abettor of it, as well as a more energetic one.\r\nWhilst Volero confined himself to the subject of the law, avoiding all\r\nabuse of the consuls, he commenced with accusing Appius and his family,\r\nas having ever been most overbearing and cruel towards the Roman\r\ncommons, contending that he had been elected by the senators, not as\r\nconsul, but as executioner, to harass and torture the people; his rude\r\ntongue, he being a military man, was not sufficient to express the\r\nfreedom of his sentiments. Language therefore failing him, he says,\r\n\"Romans, since I do not speak with as much readiness as I make good what\r\nI have spoken, attend here to-morrow. I will either die here before your\r\neyes, or will carry the law.\" On the following day the tribunes take\r\npossession of the temple; the consuls and the nobility take their places\r\nin the assembly to obstruct the law. Lætorius orders all persons to be\r\nremoved, except those going to vote; the young nobles kept their places,\r\npaying no regard to the officer; then Lætorius orders some of them to be\r\nseized. The consul Appius insisted \"that the tribune had no jurisdiction\r\nover any one except a plebeian; for that he was not a magistrate of the\r\npeople in general, but only of the commons; for that even he himself\r\ncould not, according to the usage of their ancestors, by virtue of his\r\nauthority remove any person; because the words run thus, _if ye think\r\nproper, depart, Romans_.\" He was able to disconcert Lætorius by arguing\r\nfluently and contemptuously concerning the right. The tribune therefore,\r\nburning with rage, sends his beadle to the consul; the consul sends his\r\nlictor to the tribune, exclaiming that he was a private individual,\r\nwithout power and without magistracy; and the tribune would have been\r\nroughly treated, had not both the entire assembly risen up with great\r\nwarmth in behalf of the tribune against the consul, and a rush of\r\npersons belonging to the multitude, which was now much excited, taken\r\nplace from the entire city into the forum. Appius, however, withstood\r\nso great a storm with obstinacy, and the contest would have ended in a\r\nbattle, not without blood, had not Quintius, the other consul, after\r\ngiving it in charge to the men of consular dignity to remove his\r\ncolleague from the forum by force, if they could not do it otherwise,\r\nhimself assuaged the enraged people by entreaties, and implored the\r\ntribunes to dismiss the assembly. \"That they should give their passion\r\ntime to cool; that delay would not deprive them of their power, but\r\nwould add prudence to strength; and that the senators would be under the\r\ncontrol of the people, and the consul under that of the senators.\"\r\n\r\n57. With difficulty the people were pacified by Quintius: with much more\r\ndifficulty was the other consul by the patricians. The assembly of the\r\npeople being at length dismissed, the consuls convene the senate; where,\r\nthough fear and resentment by turns had produced a diversity of\r\nopinions, the more they were recalled, after the lapse of time, from\r\nviolence to reflection, the more averse did they become to a continuance\r\nof the dispute, so that they returned thanks to Quintius, because by his\r\nexertions the disturbance had been quieted. Appius is requested \"to\r\nconsent that the consular dignity should be merely so great as it could\r\nbe in a peaceably conducted state; that as long as the tribune and\r\nconsuls were drawing all power, each to his own side, no strength was\r\nleft between; that the object aimed at was in whose hands the\r\ncommonwealth should be, distracted and torn as it was, rather than that\r\nit should be safe.\" Appius, on the contrary, called gods and men to\r\nwitness that \"the commonwealth was betrayed and abandoned through\r\ncowardice; that it was not the consul that was wanting to the senate,\r\nbut the senate to the consul; that more oppressive laws were now being\r\nsubmitted to than were sanctioned on the sacred mount.\" Overcome however\r\nby the unanimous feeling of the senators, he desisted: the law is\r\ncarried without opposition.\r\n\r\n58. Then for the first time the tribunes were elected in the comitia by\r\ntribes. Piso said that three were added to the number, whereas there had\r\nbeen only two before. He names the tribunes also, Caius Sicinius, Lucius\r\nNumitorius, Marcus Duilius, Spurius Icilius, Lucius Mecilius. During the\r\ndisturbance at Rome, a war with the Volscians and Æquans broke out; they\r\nhad laid waste the lands, so that if any secession of the people should\r\ntake place, they might find a refuge with them. The differences being\r\nafterwards settled, they removed their camp backwards. Appius Claudius\r\nwas sent against the Volscians; the Æquans fell to Quintius as his\r\nprovince. The severity of Appius was the same in war as at home, being\r\nmore unrestrained because he was free from tribunitian control. He hated\r\nthe commons with more than his father's hatred: he had been defeated by\r\nthem: when he was set up as the only consul to oppose the tribunitian\r\ninfluence, a law was passed, which former consuls obstructed with less\r\neffort, amid hopes of the senators by no means so great (as those formed\r\nof him). His resentment and indignation at this, excited his imperious\r\ntemper to harass the army by the rigour of his command; nor could it\r\n(the army) however be subdued by any means; such a spirit of opposition\r\nhad they imbibed. They executed every measure slowly, indolently,\r\nnegligently, and with stubbornness: neither shame nor fear restrained\r\nthem. If he wished the army to move on with expedition, they designedly\r\nwent more slowly: if he came up to them to encourage them in their work,\r\nthey all relaxed the energy which they before exerted of their own\r\naccord: when he was present they cast down their eyes, they silently\r\ncursed him as he passed by; so that his mind, invulnerable to plebeian\r\nhatred, was sometimes moved. All kind of harsh treatment being tried in\r\nvain, he no longer held any intercourse with the soldiers; he said the\r\narmy was corrupted by the centurions; he sometimes gibingly called them\r\ntribunes of the people and Voleros.\r\n\r\n59. None of these circumstances were unknown to the Volscians, and they\r\npressed on with so much the more vigour, hoping that the Roman army\r\nwould entertain the same spirit of opposition against Appius, which they\r\nhad formerly entertained against the consul Fabius. But they were much\r\nmore violent against Appius than against Fabius. For they were not only\r\nunwilling to conquer, like Fabius' army, but they wished to be\r\nconquered. When led out to the field, they made for their camp in an\r\nignominious flight, nor did they stand their ground until they saw the\r\nVolscians advancing to their fortifications, and making dreadful havoc\r\non the rear of their army. Then the obligation to fight was wrung from\r\nthem, in order that the victorious enemy should be dislodged from their\r\nlines; yet it was sufficiently plain that the Roman soldiers were only\r\nunwilling that their camp should be taken; some of them gloried in their\r\nown defeat and disgrace. When the determined spirit of Appius, undaunted\r\nby these things, wished to exercise severity still further, and he\r\nsummoned a meeting, the lieutenant-generals and tribunes flock around\r\nhim, advising him \"that he would not determine on venturing a trial of\r\nan authority, the entire strength of which lay in the acquiescence of\r\nthose who were to obey. That the soldiers generally refused to come to\r\nthe assembly, and that their clamours were heard in every direction\r\ndemanding that the camp should be removed from the Volscian territory.\r\nThat the victorious enemy were but a little time ago almost at the very\r\ngates and rampart; and that not merely a suspicion, but a manifest\r\nindication of a grievous disaster presented itself to their eyes.\"\r\nYielding at length, (since they would gain nothing save a delay of\r\npunishment,) having prorogued the assembly, after he had given orders\r\nthat their march should be proclaimed for the following day, he, at the\r\nfirst dawn, gave the signal for departure by sound of trumpet. When the\r\narmy, having just got clear of the camp, were forming themselves, the\r\nVolscians, as being aroused by the same signal, fall upon those in the\r\nrear; from whom the alarm spreading to the van, confounded both the\r\nbattalions and ranks with such consternation, that neither the generals'\r\norders could be distinctly heard, nor the lines be drawn up, no one\r\nthinking of any thing but flight. In such confusion did they make their\r\nway through heaps of dead bodies and of arms, that the enemy ceased to\r\npursue sooner than the Romans to fly. The soldiers being at length\r\ncollected from their scattered rout, the consul, after he had in vain\r\nfollowed his men for the purpose of rallying them, pitched his camp in a\r\npeaceful part of the country; and an assembly being convened, after\r\ninveighing not without good reason against the army, as traitors to\r\nmilitary discipline, deserters of their posts, frequently asking them,\r\none by one, where were their standards, where their arms; he first beat\r\nwith rods and then beheaded those soldiers who had thrown down their\r\narms, the standard-bearers who had lost their standards, and moreover\r\nthe centurions, and those with the double allowance, who had left their\r\nranks. With respect to the rest of the multitude, every tenth man was\r\ndrawn by lot for punishment.\r\n\r\n60. In a contrary manner to this, the consul and soldiers in the country\r\nof the Æquans vied with each other in courtesy and acts of kindness:\r\nboth Quintius was naturally milder in disposition, and the ill-fated\r\nseverity of his colleague caused him to indulge more in his own good\r\ntemper. This, such great cordiality between the general and his army,\r\nthe Æquans did not venture to meet; they suffered the enemy to go\r\nthrough their lands committing devastations in every direction. Nor were\r\ndepredations committed more extensively in that quarter in any preceding\r\nwar. Praises were also added, in which the minds of soldiers find no\r\nless pleasure than in rewards. The army returned more reconciled both to\r\ntheir general, and also on account of the general to the patricians;\r\nstating that a parent was assigned to them, a master to the other army\r\nby the senate. The year now passed, with varied success in war, and\r\nfurious dissensions at home and abroad, was rendered memorable chiefly\r\nby the elections by tribes; the matter was more important from the\r\nvictory in the contest entered into, than from any real advantage; for\r\nthere was more of dignity abstracted from the elections themselves by\r\nthe exclusion of the patricians, than there was influence either added\r\nto the commons or taken from the patricians.\r\n\r\n61. A more turbulent year[99] next followed, Lucius Valerius, Tiberius\r\nÆmilius being consuls, both by reason of the struggles between the\r\ndifferent orders concerning the agrarian law, as well as on account of\r\nthe trial of Appius Claudius; for whom, as a most active opposer of the\r\nlaw, and as one who supported the cause of the possessors of the public\r\nland, as if a third consul, Marcus Duilius and Caius Sicinius appointed\r\na day of trial.[100] Never before was an accused person so hateful to\r\nthe commons brought to trial before the people; overwhelmed with their\r\nresentment on his own account,[101] and also on account of his father.\r\nThe patricians too seldom made equal exertions in behalf of any one:\r\n\"that the champion of the senate, and the assertor of their dignity,\r\nopposed to all the storms of the tribunes and commons, was exposed to\r\nthe resentment of the commons, merely for having exceeded bounds in the\r\ncontest.\" Appius Claudius himself was the only one of the patricians who\r\nmade light both of the tribunes and commons and his own trial. Neither\r\nthe threats of the commons, nor the entreaties of the senate, could ever\r\npersuade him not only to change his garb, or address persons as a\r\nsuppliant, but not even so far as to soften or relax any thing from the\r\nusual asperity of his style, when his cause was to be pleaded before the\r\npeople. The expression of his countenance was the same; the same\r\nstubbornness in his looks, the same spirit of pride in his language; so\r\nthat a great part of the commons felt no less awe of Appius when\r\narraigned, than they had felt of him when consul. He pleaded his cause\r\nonce, and with the same spirit of an accuser which he had been\r\naccustomed to adopt on all occasions: and he so far astounded both the\r\ntribunes and the commons by his intrepidity, that, of their own accord,\r\nthey postponed the day of trial; then they allowed the matter to be\r\nprotracted. Nor was the time now very distant; before, however, the\r\nappointed day came, he dies of some disease; and when the tribunes of\r\nthe people endeavoured to impede his funeral panegyric,[102] the commons\r\nwould not allow that the last day of so great a man should be defrauded\r\nof the usual honours; and they listened to the panegyric of him when\r\ndead with as patient ears, as they had listened to the charges brought\r\nagainst him when living, and attended his funeral in vast numbers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 99: Niebuhr, ii. p. 231, thinks that it was in this year the\r\nIcilian law was passed, according to which, any person interrupting the\r\nproceedings of the tribunes, rendered himself liable to capital\r\npunishment.--_Twiss._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 100: Several charges were brought against Appius, according to\r\nDion. ix. 54, who also states that he did not die of any disease, but\r\nthat he laid violent hands on himself.--_Ruperti._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 101: The original has _plenus suarum_--_irarum_,--that is, the\r\nanger not of Appius against the commons, but of the commons against\r\nhim.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 102: Conf. Nieb. ii. n. 754. It may be well to mention that\r\nNiebuhr considered that this account regarding the death of Appius was\r\nall fictitious. The Greek writers, scil. Dion. ix. 54, Zonar. vii. 17,\r\nstate that he laid violent hands on himself.]\r\n\r\n62. In the same year the consul Valerius, having marched an army against\r\nthe Æquans, when he could not entice the enemy to an engagement, set\r\nabout assaulting their camp. A violent storm sent down from heaven with\r\nthunder and hail prevented him. Then, on a signal for a retreat being\r\ngiven, their surprise was excited by the return of such fair weather,\r\nthat they felt a scruple a second time to attack a camp which was\r\ndefended as it were by some divine power; all the rage of war was turned\r\non the devastation of the land. The other consul, Æmilius, conducted the\r\nwar against the Sabines. There also, because the enemy confined\r\nthemselves within their walls, the lands were laid waste. Then, by the\r\nburning not only of the country-houses, but of the villages also, which\r\nwere thickly inhabited, the Sabines being aroused, after they met the\r\ndepredators, on retreating from an engagement left undecided, on the\r\nfollowing day removed their camp into a safer situation. This seemed a\r\nsufficient reason to the consul why he should leave the enemy as\r\nconquered, departing thence the war being still unfinished.\r\n\r\n63. During these wars, whilst dissensions still continued at home, Titus\r\nNumicius Priscus, Aulus Virginius, were elected consuls. The commons\r\nappeared determined no longer to brook a delay of the agrarian law, and\r\nextreme violence was on the eve of being resorted to, when it was\r\nascertained from the burning of the country-houses and the flight of the\r\npeasants that the Volscians were at hand: this circumstance checked the\r\nsedition that was now ripe and almost breaking out. The consuls, having\r\nbeen instantly forced to the war by the senate,[103] after leading forth\r\nthe youth from the city, rendered the rest of the commons more quiet.\r\nAnd the enemy indeed, having done nothing else except alarming the\r\nRomans by groundless fear, depart with great precipitation. Numicius\r\nmarched to Antium against the Volscians, Virginius against the Æquans.\r\nHere a signal overthrow being well nigh received from an ambuscade, the\r\nbravery of the soldiers restored (the Roman) superiority, which had been\r\nendangered through the carelessness of the consul. The general conducted\r\naffairs better against the Volscians. The enemy were routed in the first\r\nengagement, and forced to fly into the city of Antium, a very wealthy\r\nplace considering those times; the consul, not venturing to attack it,\r\ntook from the people of Antium another town, Ceno, which was by no means\r\nso wealthy. Whilst the Æquans and Volscians engage the attention of the\r\nRoman armies, the Sabines advanced in their devastations even to the\r\ngates of the city: then they themselves, a few days after, received from\r\nthe two armies heavier losses than they had occasioned, the two consuls\r\nhaving entered their territories under exasperated feelings.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 103: In the original we read _coacti extemplo ab senatu_.\r\nNiebuhr considers this reading to be corrupt, and is satisfied that the\r\ncorrect reading is _coacto extemplo senatu_. See ii. n. 555.]\r\n\r\n64. Towards the close of the year there was some peace, but, as\r\nfrequently at other times, disturbed by contests between the patricians\r\nand commons. The exasperated commons refused to attend the consular\r\nelections: Titus Quintius, Quintus Servilius, were elected consuls by\r\nthe patricians and their dependents: the consuls have a year similar to\r\nthe preceding, the commencement embroiled, and afterwards tranquil by\r\nexternal war. The Sabines marching across the plains of Crustuminum with\r\ngreat rapidity, after carrying fire and sword along the banks of the\r\nAnio, being repulsed when they had come up nearly to the Colline gate\r\nand the walls, drove off however great booty of men and cattle: the\r\nconsul Servilius, having pursued them with a determined army, was unable\r\nto come up with the main body itself on the campaign country; he carried\r\nhis devastation however so extensively, that he left nothing unmolested\r\nby war, and returned after obtaining plunder much exceeding that carried\r\noff by the enemy. The public interest was supported extremely well\r\nagainst the Volscians also by the exertions as well of the general as of\r\nthe soldiers. First they fought a pitched battle, on equal ground, with\r\ngreat slaughter and much bloodshed on both sides: and the Romans,\r\nbecause the fewness of their numbers was more likely to make the loss\r\nfelt, would have given way, had not the consul, by a well-timed fiction,\r\nre-animated the army, crying out that the enemy were flying on the other\r\nwing; making a charge, they, by supposing that they were victorious,\r\nbecame so. The consul, fearing lest by pressing too far he might renew\r\nthe contest, gave the signal for a retreat. A few days intervened; rest\r\nbeing taken on both sides as if by a tacit suspension of arms; during\r\nthese days a vast number of persons from all the states of the Volscians\r\nand Æquans came to the camp, certain that the Romans would depart during\r\nthe night, if they should perceive them. Accordingly about the third\r\nwatch they come to attack the camp. Quintius having allayed the\r\nconfusion which the sudden panic had occasioned, after ordering the\r\nsoldiers to remain quiet in their tents, leads out a cohort of the\r\nHernicians for an advance guard: the trumpeters and horneteers he mounts\r\non horseback, and commands them to sound their trumpets before the\r\nrampart, and to keep the enemy in suspense till daylight: during the\r\nrest of the night every thing was so quiet in the camp, that the Romans\r\nhad even the advantage of sleep. The sight of the armed infantry, whom\r\nthey both considered to be more numerous than they were, and to be\r\nRomans, the bustle and neighing of the horses, which became restless,\r\nboth from the strange riders placed on them, and moreover from the sound\r\nof the trumpets frightening them, kept the Volscians intently awaiting\r\nan attack of the enemy.\r\n\r\n65. When day dawned, the Romans, invigorated and refreshed with sleep,\r\non being marched out to battle, at the first onset overpowered the\r\nVolscians, wearied from standing and want of rest; though the enemy\r\nrather retired than were routed, because in the rear there were hills to\r\nwhich there was a secure retreat, the ranks behind the first line being\r\nunbroken. The consul, when they came to the uneven ground, halts his\r\narmy; the soldiers were kept back with difficulty; they cried out and\r\ndemanded to be allowed to pursue the enemy now discomfited. The cavalry,\r\ncrowding around the general, proceed more violently: they cry out that\r\nthey would proceed before the first line. Whilst the consul hesitates,\r\nrelying on the valour of his men, yet having little confidence in the\r\nplace, they all cry out that they would proceed; and execution followed\r\nthe shout. Fixing their spears in the ground, in order that they may be\r\nlighter to ascend the steeps, they run upwards. The Volscians, having\r\ndischarged their missile weapons at the first onset, fling the stones\r\nlying at their feet on them as they advanced upwards, and having thrown\r\nthem into confusion by incessant blows, they drove them from the higher\r\nground: thus the left wing of the Romans was nearly overborne, had not\r\nthe consul dispelled their fear by exciting a sense of shame as they\r\nwere just retreating, chiding at the same time their temerity and their\r\ncowardice. At first they stood their ground with determined firmness;\r\nthen, according as their strength carried them against those in\r\npossession of the ground, they venture to advance themselves; and by\r\nrenewing the shout they encourage the whole body to move on; then again\r\nmaking a new effort, they force their way up and surmount the\r\ndisadvantage of the ground. They were on the point of gaining the summit\r\nof the eminence, when the enemy turned their backs, and the pursued and\r\npursuers with precipitate speed rushed into the camp almost in a body.\r\nIn this consternation the camp is taken; such of the Volscians as were\r\nable to make their escape, take the road to Antium. The Roman army also\r\nwas led to Antium; after being invested for a few days it surrenders\r\nwithout any additional force of the besiegers,[104] but because their\r\nspirits had sunk ever since the unsuccessful battle and the loss of\r\ntheir camp.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 104: _Additional force of the_, &c. Crovier understands this\r\nto signify that the Romans did not employ a greater force for besieging\r\nAntium, than they had employed the preceding year, and which at that\r\ntime seemed insufficient for the purpose. Others understand the words to\r\nsignify that they surrendered without waiting for the Romans to make any\r\nadditional efforts to take the town.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Disturbances about the agrarian laws.

After the taking of Antium, Titus Æmilius and Quintus Fabius are\r\nelected consuls. This was the Fabius Quintus who alone had survived the\r\nfamily cut off at Cremera. Already, in his former consulate, Æmilius had\r\nbeen an adviser of giving land to the people. Accordingly in his second\r\nconsulate also both the abettors of the agrarian law had raised\r\nthemselves to the hope of carrying the measure, and the tribunes,\r\nsupposing that a matter frequently attempted in opposition to both\r\nconsuls might be obtained with the assistance at least of one consul,\r\ntake it up, and the consul remained stedfast in his sentiments. The\r\npossessors and a considerable part of the patricians complaining that a\r\nperson at the head of the state was recommending himself by his\r\ntribunitial proceedings, and that he was making himself popular by\r\ngiving away other persons' property, had transferred the odium of the\r\nentire affair from the tribunes to the consul. A violent contest was at\r\nhand, had not Fabius set the matter straight, by an expedient\r\ndisagreeable to neither party, \"that under the conduct and auspices of\r\nTitus Quintius, there was a considerable tract of land taken the\r\npreceding year from the Volscians; that a colony might be sent to\r\nAntium, a neighbouring, convenient, and maritime city; that the commons\r\nmight come in for lands without any complaints of the present occupiers,\r\nthat the state might remain in quiet.\" This proposition was accepted. He\r\nappoints as triumvirs for distributing the land, Titus Quintius, Aulus\r\nVirginius, and Publius Furius: those who wished to obtain land were\r\nordered to give in their names. The gratification of their aim begat\r\ndisgust, as usually happens; so few gave in their names that Volscian\r\ncolonists were added to fill up the number: the rest of the people\r\npreferred clamouring for land in Rome, rather than receive it elsewhere.\r\nThe Æquans sued for peace from Quintus Fabius, (he was sent thither with\r\nan army,) and they themselves broke it by a sudden incursion into the\r\nLatin territory.\r\n\r\n2. In the following year Quintus Servilius, (for he was consul with\r\nSpurius Posthumius,) being sent against the Æquans, fixed his camp in\r\nthe Latin territory: inaction necessarily kept the army within the camp,\r\ninvolved as they were in a distemper. The war was protracted to the\r\nthird year, Quintus Fabius and Titus Quintius being consuls. To Fabius,\r\nbecause he, as conqueror, had granted[105] peace to the Æquans, that\r\nprovince was assigned by an extraordinary commission: who, setting out\r\nwith certain hope that the fame of his name would reduce the Æquans to\r\nsubmission, sent ambassadors to the council of the nation, and ordered\r\nthem to say \"that Quintus Fabius, the consul, stated that he had brought\r\npeace to Rome from the Æquans, that from Rome he now brought war to the\r\nÆquans, that same right hand being armed, which he had formerly given to\r\nthem in amity; that the gods were now witnesses, and would presently be\r\navengers of those by whose perfidy and perjury that was brought to pass.\r\nThat he, however, be matters as they might, would even now prefer that\r\nthe Æquans should repent of their own accord than be subject to the\r\nvengeance of an enemy. If they repent, that there would be a safe\r\nretreat in that clemency already experienced; but if they still\r\ndelighted in perjury, they would wage war with the angry gods rather\r\nthan with enemies.\" This statement had so little effect on any of them,\r\nthat the ambassadors were near being ill-treated, and an army was sent\r\nto Algidum against the Romans. When these tidings were brought to Rome,\r\nthe indignity of the affair, rather than the danger, called out the\r\nother consul from the city; thus two consular armies advanced against\r\nthe enemy in order of battle, so that they might at once engage. But as\r\nit so happened that much of the day did not now remain, a person from\r\nthe advanced guard of the enemy cries out, \"This is making a display of\r\nwar, Romans, not waging it; you draw up your army in line of battle,\r\nwhen night is at hand; we require a greater length of day-light for the\r\ncontest which is to come on. To-morrow by sun-rise return to the field:\r\nyou shall have an opportunity of fighting, never fear.\" The soldiers,\r\nstung by these threats, are marched back into the camp till the\r\nfollowing day; thinking that the approaching night was tedious, which\r\nwould cause delay to the contest. Then indeed they refresh their bodies\r\nwith food and sleep: on the following day, when it was light, the Roman\r\narmy took their post considerably sooner. At length the Æquans also came\r\nforward. The battle was obstinate on both sides, because both the Romans\r\nfought under the influence of resentment and hatred; and a consciousness\r\nof danger brought on by misconduct, and despair of obtaining future\r\nconfidence afterwards, obliged the Æquans to exert and have recourse to\r\nthe most desperate efforts. The Æquans however did not withstand the\r\nRoman troops, and when on being beaten they had betaken themselves to\r\ntheir own territories, the outrageous multitude, with dispositions not\r\nat all more disposed to peace, began to chide their leaders: \"that their\r\ninterest was committed to the hazard of a pitched battle, in which mode\r\nof fighting the Romans were superior. That the Æquans were better fitted\r\nfor depredations and incursions, and that several parties acting in\r\ndifferent directions conducted wars more successfully than the unwieldy\r\nmass of one single army.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 105: _Dederat_. The _oratio obliqua_ would require _dederit_\r\nhere, but such instances of the indicative being used for the\r\nsubjunctive are by no means infrequent.]\r\n\r\n3. Having left therefore a guard on the camp, they marched out and\r\nattacked the Roman frontiers with such fury, as to carry terror even to\r\nthe city: the unexpected nature of the thing also caused more alarm,\r\nbecause nothing could be less apprehended, than that an enemy,\r\nvanquished and almost besieged in their camp, should entertain a thought\r\nof depredation: and the peasants, in a panic pouring in at the gates,\r\ncried out, that it was not mere plundering, nor small parties of\r\ndepredators, but, exaggerating every thing through groundless fear, that\r\nwhole armies and legions of the enemy were advancing, and that they were\r\npushing forward to the city determined for an assault. Those who were\r\nnearest (the gates) carried to others the accounts heard from these,\r\nuncertain as they were, and therefore the more groundless; and the hurry\r\nand confused clamour of those calling to arms bore no distant\r\nresemblance to the panic of a city taken by storm. It so happened that\r\nthe consul Quintius had returned to Rome from Algidum; this was some\r\nrelief for their terror; and the tumult being calmed, and after chiding\r\nthem for being in dread of a vanquished enemy, he posted a guard on the\r\ngates. Then having convened the senate, when he set out to defend the\r\nfrontiers, a suspension[106] of civil business having been proclaimed by\r\na decree of the senate, leaving Quintus Servilius behind as prefect of\r\nthe city, he found no enemy in the country. Matters were conducted with\r\ndistinguished success by the other consul; who having attacked the\r\nenemy, wherever he knew that they were to come, laden with booty, and\r\nproceeding therefore with their army the more encumbered, made their\r\ndepredation prove fatal to them. Few of the enemy escaped from the\r\nambuscade; all the booty was recovered; thus the return of the consul\r\nQuintius to the city put a termination to the justitium, which lasted\r\nonly four days. A census was then held, and the lustrum was closed by\r\nQuintius: the number of citizens rated are said to have been one hundred\r\nand twenty-four thousand two hundred and fourteen, besides orphans of\r\nboth sexes. Nothing memorable occurred afterwards among the Æquans; they\r\nbetook themselves into their towns, suffering their possessions to be\r\nconsumed by fire and to be devastated. The consul, after he had\r\nrepeatedly carried depredation through the entire country of the enemy,\r\nreturned to Rome with great glory and booty.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 106: _Justitium_--a jure sistendo.]\r\n\r\n4. Then Aulus Posthumius Albus and Spurius Furius Fusus were consuls.\r\nFurii some writers have written Fusii; this I mention, lest any one may\r\nimagine that the change, which is only in the names, may be in the\r\npersons themselves. There was no doubt but that one of the consuls would\r\ncommence hostilities against the Æquans. The Æquans accordingly sought\r\naid from the Volscians of Ecetra; which being granted readily, (so\r\nkeenly did these states vie in inveterate hatred against the Romans,)\r\npreparations for war were made with the utmost vigour. The Hernicians\r\ncame to the knowledge of it, and warned the Romans that the Ecetrans had\r\nrevolted to the Æquans; the colony of Antium also was suspected, because\r\nwhen the town was taken, a great number of the inhabitants had fled\r\nthence for refuge to the Æquans: and these proved the bravest soldiers\r\nduring the war with the Æquans. Afterwards the Æquans being driven into\r\nthe towns, this rabble withdrawing privately, when they returned to\r\nAntium, seduced from the Romans the colonists who were already disposed\r\nto treachery of their own accord. The matter not being yet ripe, when it\r\nwas announced to the senate that a defection was intended, the consuls\r\nwere charged to inquire into the business by summoning to Rome the\r\nleading men of the colony. When those persons attended without\r\nreluctance, being conducted to the senate by the consuls, they so\r\nanswered to the questions put to them, that they were dismissed more\r\nsuspected than they had come. Upon this war was considered as\r\ninevitable. Spurius Fusius, one of the consuls to whom that province had\r\nfallen, having marched against the Æquans, found the enemy committing\r\ndepredations in the country of the Hernicians; and being ignorant of\r\ntheir numbers, because they had never been seen all together, he rashly\r\nhazarded an engagement with an army not a match for their forces. Being\r\nbeaten from his ground at the first onset, he betook himself to his\r\ncamp: nor was that an end of the danger: for both on the next night and\r\nthe following day, his camp was beset and assaulted with such vigour,\r\nthat not even a messenger could be sent from thence to Rome. The\r\nHernicians brought an account both that a defeat had taken place, and\r\nthat the army was besieged: and they struck such terror into the senate,\r\nthat a charge was given to the other consul Posthumius, that he should\r\n\"take care that the commonwealth sustained no injury,\"[107] which form\r\nof a decree has ever been deemed to be one of extreme exigency. It\r\nseemed most advisable that the consul himself should remain at Rome to\r\nenlist all who were able to bear arms: that Titus Quintius should be\r\nsent as pro-consul[108] to the relief of the camp with the army of the\r\nallies: to complete that army the Latins and Hernicians, and the colony\r\nof Antium, were ordered to supply Quintius with subitary soldiers (so\r\nthey then called auxiliaries raised for sudden emergencies).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 107: According to Stroth, this is the first instance we have\r\nof a decree of the senate arming the consul with almost dictatorial\r\npower.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 108: _Pro-consul_:--the first mention of a pro-consul in\r\nLivy.]\r\n\r\n5. During those days many movements and many attempts were made on\r\neither side, because the enemy, having the advantage in numbers,\r\nattempted to weaken the Roman strength by dividing it into many parts,\r\nas not being likely to suffice for all points of attack. At the same\r\ntime the camp was besieged, at the same time a part of the army was sent\r\nto devastate the Roman territory, and to attempt the city itself, if\r\nfortune should favour. Lucius Valerius was left to guard the city: the\r\nconsul Postumius was sent to repel the attacks on the frontiers. There\r\nwas no abatement in any part either in vigilance or activity; watches in\r\nthe city, out-posts before the gates, and guards stationed along the\r\nwalls: and a justitium was observed for several days (a thing which was\r\nnecessary in such general confusion). In the mean time the consul\r\nFurius, after he had at first passively endured the siege in his camp,\r\nburst forth from the Decuman gate on the enemy when off their guard; and\r\nthough he might have pursued them, he stopped through fear, lest an\r\nattack should be made on the camp from the other side. The\r\nlieutenant-general Furius (he was the consul's brother) was carried away\r\ntoo far by his ardour; nor did he, from his eagerness to pursue, observe\r\nhis own party returning, nor the attack of the enemy on his rear: thus\r\nbeing shut out, after repeatedly making many unavailing efforts to force\r\nhis way to the camp, he fell, fighting bravely. And the consul, turning\r\nabout to renew the fight, on hearing the account that his brother was\r\nsurrounded, rushing into the thick of the fight rather rashly than with\r\nsufficient caution, received a wound, and was with difficulty rescued by\r\nthose around him. This both damped the courage of his own men, and\r\nrendered the enemy more daring; who, being encouraged by the death of\r\nthe lieutenant-general, and by the consul's wound, could not afterwards\r\nbe withstood by any force, so as to prevent the Romans from being driven\r\nwithin their camp and again submitting to a siege, as being a match for\r\nthem neither in hopes nor in strength; and every thing would have been\r\nendangered, had not T. Quintius come to their relief with foreign troops\r\nfrom the Latin and Hernician army. He attacked the Æquans on their rear\r\nwhilst intent on the Roman camp, and insultingly displaying the head of\r\nthe lieutenant-general, and, a sally being made at the same time from\r\nthe camp on a signal given at a distance by him, he surrounded a great\r\nnumber of the enemy. Of the Æquans on the Roman territory the slaughter\r\nwas less, their dispersion was more complete. On these as they straggled\r\nin different directions, and were driving plunder before them, Postumius\r\nmade an attack in several places, where he had posted convenient\r\ndetachments; these straying about and pursuing their flight in great\r\ndisorder, fell in with the victorious Quintius as he was returning with\r\nthe wounded consul. Then did the consular army by their distinguished\r\nbravery take ample vengeance for the consul's wound, and for the death\r\nof the lieutenant-general and the cohorts; heavy losses were both\r\ninflicted and received on both sides during those days. In a matter of\r\nsuch antiquity it is difficult to state with certainty the exact number\r\nof those who fought or fell: Antias Valerius, however, ventures to sum\r\nthem up; that in the Hernician territory there fell five thousand three\r\nhundred Romans; that of the predatory parties of the Æquans, who strayed\r\nthrough the Roman frontiers for the purpose of plundering, two thousand\r\nfour hundred were slain by the consul Postumius; that the rest of the\r\nbody that were driving booty before them, and which fell in with\r\nQuintius, by no means got off with so light a loss: that of these four\r\nthousand, and by way of stating the number exactly, two hundred and\r\nthirty, were slain. After this they returned to Rome; the order for the\r\njustitium was discharged. The sky seemed to be all on fire; and other\r\nprodigies either actually presented themselves to their sight, or\r\nexhibited imaginary appearances to their affrighted minds. To avert\r\nthese terrors, a solemn festival of three days was proclaimed, during\r\nwhich, all the temples were filled with a crowd of men and women,\r\nearnestly imploring the protection of the gods. After this the Latin and\r\nHernician cohorts were sent back to their respective homes, thanks\r\nhaving been returned to them for their spirited military services. The\r\nthousand soldiers from Antium were dismissed almost with disgrace,\r\nbecause they had come after the battle with assistance then too late.\r\n\r\n6. The elections were then held: Lucius Æbutius and Publius Servilius\r\nbeing elected consuls, enter on their office on the calends of August,\r\nwhich was then considered as the commencement of the year.[109] This was\r\na distressing time, and it so happened that the season was pestilential\r\nto the city and country, and not more to men than to cattle; and they\r\nincreased the malignity of the distemper, by admitting[110] the cattle\r\nand the peasants into the city through dread of devastation. This\r\ncollection of animals of every kind mixed together, distressed both the\r\ncitizens by the unusual stench, and the peasants crowded together into\r\ntheir close apartments, with heat, want of sleep, and their attendance\r\non each other, and contact itself propagated the disease. Whilst with\r\ndifficulty sustaining these calamities, ambassadors from the Hernicians\r\nsuddenly bring word that the Æquans and Volscians, having united their\r\nforces, had pitched their camp in their territory, that from thence they\r\nwere depopulating their frontiers with an immense army. Besides that the\r\nthinness of the senate was a proof to the allies that the state was\r\nprostrated by the pestilence, they further received this melancholy\r\nanswer: \"That the Hernicians, with the Latins, must now defend their\r\npossessions by their own exertions. That the Roman city, through the\r\nsudden anger of the gods, was now depopulated by disease. If any respite\r\nfrom that calamity should come, that they would afford aid to their\r\nallies, as they had done the year before, and always on other\r\noccasions.\" The allies departed, carrying home, instead of the\r\nmelancholy news (they had brought), news still more melancholy, as being\r\npersons who were now obliged to sustain by their own means a war, which\r\nthey had sustained with difficulty when backed by the power of Rome. The\r\nenemy did not confine themselves any longer to the Hernician territory.\r\nThey proceed thence with determined hostility into the Roman\r\nterritories, which were already devastated without the injuries of war.\r\nWhere, when there was no one to meet them, not even an unarmed person,\r\nand they passed through every place destitute not only of troops, but\r\neven of the cultivation of the husbandman, they reached as far as the\r\nthird stone on the Gabinian road. Æbutius, the Roman consul, was dead;\r\nhis colleague, Servilius, was dragging out life with slender hope of\r\nrecovery; most of the leading men, the chief part of the patricians, all\r\nof the military age, were lying sick, so that strength was wanting not\r\nonly for the expeditions, which, amid such an alarm the conjuncture\r\nrequired, but scarcely had they sufficient even for quietly mounting\r\nguard. The senators whose age and health permitted them, discharged\r\npersonally the duty of sentinels. The going around[111] and attending to\r\nthese was assigned to the ædiles of the people; on them devolved the\r\nchief administration of affairs and the majesty of the consular\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 109: Of the year,--i.e. the consular year, not the civil one,\r\nwhich commenced in January.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 110: A similar measure was adopted at Athens. See Thucyd. ii.\r\n52.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 111: _Circuitio_. Stroth observes, that this is what we\r\nunderstand by 'the Round.']\r\n\r\n7. The commonwealth thus desolate, without a head, without strength, the\r\nguardian gods and good fortune of the city saved, which inspired the\r\nVolscians and Æquans with the disposition of banditti rather than of\r\nenemies; for so far was any hope not only of taking but even of\r\napproaching the walls of Rome[112] from taking possession of their\r\nminds, and so thoroughly did the sight of the houses in the distance,\r\nand the adjacent hills, divert their thoughts, (from such an attempt,)\r\nthat, a murmur having arisen in every direction throughout the entire\r\ncamp, \"why they should waste time in indolence without booty in a wild\r\nand desert land, amid the putrid decay of cattle and of human beings,\r\nwhen they might repair to places uninjured by infection, the Tusculan\r\nterritory abounding in wealth?\" they suddenly tore up their standards,\r\nand by journeys across the country, they passed through the Lavican\r\nterritory to the Tusculan hills; and to that quarter was the whole\r\nviolence and storm of the war directed. In the mean time the Hernicians\r\nand Latins, influenced not only by compassion but by shame, if they\r\nneither gave opposition to the common enemy, when making for the city\r\nof Rome with a hostile army, nor afforded any aid to their allies when\r\nbesieged, march to Rome with their forces united. Where, when they did\r\nnot find the enemy, following their tracks as indicated by rumour, they\r\nmeet them as they are coming down from the Tusculan territory into the\r\nAlban valley: there a battle was fought under circumstances by no means\r\nequal; and their fidelity proved by no means favourable to the allies\r\nfor the present. The mortality at Rome by disease was not less than that\r\nof the allies by the sword (of the enemy); the only surviving consul\r\ndies; other eminent characters also died, Marcus Valerius, Titus\r\nVirginius Rutilus, the augurs; Servius Sulpicius, principal curio; and\r\nthrough persons of inferior note the virulence of the disease spread\r\nextensively: and the senate, destitute of human aid, directed the\r\npeople's attention to the gods and to prayers; they were ordered to go\r\nto supplicate with their wives and children, and earnestly to implore\r\nthe protection of heaven. Besides that their own sufferings obliged each\r\nto do so, when called on by public authority, they fill all the shrines;\r\nthe prostrate matrons in every quarter sweeping the temples with their\r\nhair, beg for a remission of the divine displeasure, and a termination\r\nto the pestilence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 112: According to Dionysius, the Volsci attacked Rome on this\r\noccasion.]\r\n\r\n8. From this time, whether it was from the favour of the gods being\r\nobtained, or that the more unhealthy season of the year was now passed,\r\nthe bodies of the people having shaken off disease, gradually began to\r\nbe more healthy, and their attention being now directed to public\r\nconcerns, when several interregna had expired, Publius Valerius\r\nPublicola, on the third day after he had entered on his office of\r\ninterrex, causes Lucretius Tricipitinus, and Titus Veturius Geminus, (or\r\nVelusius,) to be elected consuls. They enter on their consulship on the\r\nthird day of the Ides of August, the state being now sufficiently\r\nstrong, not only to repel a hostile attack, but even to act itself on\r\nthe offensive. Therefore when the Hernicians brought an account that the\r\nenemy had made an incursion into their frontiers, assistance was readily\r\npromised; two consular armies were enlisted. Veturius was sent against\r\nthe Volscians to carry on an offensive war. Tricipitinus being appointed\r\nto protect the territory of the allies from devastation, proceeds no\r\nfurther than into the country of the Hernicians. Veturius routs and puts\r\nto flight the enemy in the first engagement. A party of plunderers\r\nwhich had marched over the Prænestine mountains, and from thence\r\ndescended into the plains, escaped the notice of Lucretius, whilst he\r\nlay encamped amongst the Hernicians. These laid waste all the country\r\naround Præneste and Gabii: from the Gabinian territory they turn their\r\ncourse towards the heights of Tusculum; great alarm was excited in the\r\ncity of Rome also, more from the suddenness of the affair, than that\r\nthere was not sufficient strength to repel violence. Quintus Fabius had\r\nthe command in the city;[113] he, by arming the young men and posting\r\nguards, rendered things secure and tranquil. The enemy therefore\r\ncarrying off plunder from the adjacent places, not venturing to approach\r\nthe city, when they were returning by a circuitous route, their caution\r\nbeing now more relaxed, in proportion as they removed to a greater\r\ndistance from the enemy's city, fall in with the consul Lucretius, who\r\nhad already explored their motions, drawn up in battle-array and\r\ndetermined on an engagement. Accordingly having attacked them with\r\npredetermined resolution whilst struck with sudden panic, though\r\nconsiderably fewer in numbers, they rout and put to flight their\r\nnumerous army, and having driven them into the deep valleys, when an\r\negress from thence was not easy, they surround them. There the Volscian\r\nnation was almost entirely cut off. In some histories I find that\r\nthirteen thousand four hundred and seventy fell in the field and in the\r\npursuit, that one thousand two hundred and fifty were taken alive, that\r\ntwenty-seven military standards were carried off; where, though there\r\nmay have been some exaggeration in the number, there certainly was great\r\nslaughter. The victorious consul having obtained immense booty returned\r\nto the same standing camp. Then the consuls join their camps. The\r\nVolscians and Æquans also unite their shattered strength. This was the\r\nthird battle on that year; the same good fortune gave them victory; the\r\nenemy being beaten, their camp was also taken.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 113: As _præfectus urbis_.]\r\n\r\n9. Thus affairs at Rome returned to their former state; and successes\r\nabroad immediately excited commotions in the city. Caius Terentillus\r\nArsa[114] was tribune of the people in that year: he, considering that\r\nan opportunity was afforded for tribunitian intrigues during the absence\r\nof the consuls, after railing against the arrogance of the patricians\r\nfor several days before the people, inveighed chiefly against the\r\nconsular authority, as being exorbitant and intolerable in a free state:\r\n\"for that, in name only, it was less invidious, in reality almost more\r\noppressive than that of kings. For that two masters had been adopted\r\ninstead of one, with unbounded, unlimited power; who, themselves\r\nunrestrained and unbridled, directed all the terrors of the law, and all\r\nkinds of severity against the commons.\" Now, in order that this\r\nlicentious power might not continue perpetual, he would propose a law,\r\nthat five persons be appointed to draw up laws regarding the consular\r\npower. That the consul should use that right which the people may give\r\nhim over them; that they should not hold their own caprice and\r\nlicentiousness as law. This law being published, when the patricians\r\nbecame afraid, lest, in the absence of the consuls, they should be\r\nsubjected to the yoke, the senate is convened by Quintus Fabius, præfect\r\nof the city, who inveighed so vehemently against the bill and the author\r\nof it, that nothing was omitted of threats and intimidation, even though\r\nboth the consuls in all their exasperation surrounded the tribune, \"that\r\nhe had lain in wait, and, watching his opportunity, he made an attack on\r\nthe commonwealth. If the gods in their anger had given them any tribune\r\nlike him on the preceding year, during the pestilence and war, he could\r\nnot have been withstood. Both the consuls being dead, and the exhausted\r\nstate lying enfeebled in universal confusion, that he would have\r\nproposed laws to abolish the consular government altogether from the\r\nstate; that he would have headed the Volscians and Æquans to attack the\r\ncity. What? if the consuls adopted any tyrannical or cruel proceedings\r\nagainst any of the citizens, was it not competent to him to appoint a\r\nday of trial for him; to arraign him before those very judges against\r\nany one of whom severity may have been exercised? That it was not the\r\nconsular authority but the tribunitian power that he was rendering\r\nhateful and insupportable: which having been peaceable and reconciled to\r\nthe patricians, was now about to be brought back anew to its former\r\nmischievous habits. Nor would he entreat him not to go on as he\r\ncommenced. Of you, the other tribunes, says Fabius, we request, that\r\nyou will first of all consider that that power was provided for the aid\r\nof individuals, not for the ruin of the community: that you were created\r\ntribunes of the commons, not enemies of the patricians. To us it is\r\ndistressing, to you a source of odium, that the republic, now bereft of\r\nits chief magistrates, should be attacked; you will diminish not your\r\nrights, but the odium against you. Confer with your colleague, that he\r\nmay postpone this business till the arrival of the consuls; even the\r\nÆquans and the Volscians, when our consuls were carried off by\r\npestilence last year, did not press on us with a cruel and tyrannical\r\nwar.\" The tribunes confer with Terentillus, and the bill being to all\r\nappearance deferred, but in reality abandoned, the consuls were\r\nimmediately sent for.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 114: Niebuhr n. 24, 634, would have us read _Terentilius_, the\r\nRoman family names always, he says, ending in _ius_. He also thinks that\r\nfor _Arsa_, we should read _Harsa_.]\r\n\r\n10. Lucretius returned with immense spoil, and much greater glory; and\r\nthis glory he increased on his arrival, by exposing all the booty in the\r\nCampus Martius, so that each person might, during three days, recognise\r\nhis own and carry it away; the remainder was sold, for which no owners\r\nappeared. A triumph was by universal consent due to the consul: but the\r\nmatter was deferred, the tribune still pressing his law; this to the\r\nconsul seemed of greater importance. The business was discussed for\r\nseveral days, both in the senate and before the people: at length the\r\ntribune yielded to the majesty of the consul, and desisted; then the due\r\nhonour was rendered to the general and his army. He triumphed over the\r\nVolscians and Æquans: his troops followed him in his triumph. The other\r\nconsul was allowed to enter the city in ovation without his soldiers. On\r\nthe following year the Terentillian law having been taken up by the\r\nentire college, assailed the new consuls; the consuls were Publius\r\nVolumnius and Servius Sulpicius. On that year the sky seemed to be on\r\nfire; a violent earthquake also occurred; it was now believed that an ox\r\nspoke, which circumstance had not obtained credit on the year before;\r\namong other prodigies it rained flesh also;[115] which shower a great\r\nnumber of birds is reported to have carried off by flying so as to\r\nintercept it; that which did fall, is said to have lain scattered about\r\nfor several days, so that its smell evinced no change. The books[116]\r\nwere consulted by the duumviri for sacred rites: dangers of attacks\r\nbeing made on the highest parts of the city, and of bloodshed thence\r\nresulting, were predicted as about to come from an assemblage of\r\nstrangers; among other things, an admonition was given that all\r\nintestine disturbances should be abandoned. The tribunes alleged that\r\nthat was done to obstruct the law, and a desperate contest was at hand.\r\nLo! (that the same circle of events may revolve every year) the\r\nHernicians bring word that the Volscians and the Æquans, though their\r\nstrength was much impaired, were recruiting their armies: that their\r\nchief dependence was Antium; that the inhabitants of Antium openly held\r\ncouncils at Ecetra: that that was the source--there the strength--for\r\nthe war. As soon as this announcement was made in the senate, a levy was\r\nordered: the consuls were commanded to divide the management of the war\r\nbetween them; that the Volscians should be the province of the one, the\r\nÆquans that of the other. The tribunes cried out to their faces in the\r\nforum, \"That the Volscian war was all a concerted farce: that the\r\nHernicians were instructed to act their parts; that the liberty of the\r\nRoman people was now no longer crushed by manly efforts, but that it was\r\nbaffled by cunning; because all probability was now gone that the\r\nVolscians, who were almost exterminated, and the Æquans, would of\r\nthemselves commence hostilities, new enemies were sought for: that a\r\nloyal colony, and one in their very vicinity, was being rendered\r\ninfamous: that war was proclaimed against the unoffending people of\r\nAntium, and in reality waged with the commons of Rome, which after\r\nloading them with arms they were determined to drive out of the city\r\nwith precipitous haste, wreaking their vengeance on the tribunes, by the\r\nexile and expulsion of their fellow-citizens. That by these means, and\r\nlet them not think that there was any other object contemplated, the law\r\nwas defeated; unless, whilst the matter was still in abeyance, whilst\r\nthey were still at home and in the garb of citizens, they would take\r\nprecaution that they may not be driven out of possession of the city,\r\nand be subjected to the yoke. If they only had spirit, that support\r\nwould not be wanting; that all the tribunes were unanimous; that there\r\nwas no apprehension from abroad, no danger. That the gods had taken\r\ncare, on the preceding year, that their liberty could now be defended\r\nwith safety.\" Thus far the tribunes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 115: Niebuhr, ii. n. 631, asks whether it was worms. Sa????\r\n??a?sµata. Dion. x. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 116: The Sibylline books.]\r\n\r\n11. But, on the other side, the consuls, having placed their chairs\r\nwithin view of them, were proceeding with the levy; thither the tribunes\r\nhasten, and draw the assembly along with them; a few were cited, by way\r\nof making an experiment, and instantly violence commenced. Whomsoever\r\nthe lictor laid hold of by order of the consul, him the tribune ordered\r\nto be discharged; nor did his own proper jurisdiction set a limit to\r\neach, but whatever you set your mind upon, was to be attained by the\r\nhope of strength and by force. Just as the tribunes had behaved in\r\nimpeding the levy, in the same manner did the consuls conduct themselves\r\nin obstructing the law which was brought on every assembly day. The\r\ncommencement of the riot was, when the tribunes ordered the people to\r\nproceed to the vote, because the patricians refused to withdraw. The\r\nelder citizens scarcely attended the contest, inasmuch as it was one\r\nlikely not to be directed by prudence, but abandoned to temerity and\r\ndaring. The consuls also generally kept out of the way, lest in the\r\ngeneral confusion they should expose their dignity to any insult. There\r\nwas a young man, Cæso Quintius, a daring youth, as well by the nobility\r\nof his descent, as by his personal size and strength; to those\r\nendowments granted by the gods he himself had added many military\r\nhonours, and eloquence in the forum; so that no person in the state was\r\nconsidered more efficient either in speaking or in acting. When this\r\nperson took his place in the centre of a body of the patricians,\r\nconspicuous above the rest, carrying as it were in his eloquence and\r\nbodily strength dictatorships and consulships combined, he alone\r\nwithstood the storms of the tribunes and the populace. Under his\r\nguidance the tribunes were frequently driven from the forum, the commons\r\nrouted and dispersed; such as came in his way, went off after being\r\nill-treated and stripped; so that it became sufficiently evident, that,\r\nif he were allowed to proceed in this way, the law would be defeated.\r\nThen the other tribunes being now almost thrown into despair, Aulus\r\nVirginius, one of the college, institutes a criminal prosecution on a\r\ncapital charge against Cæso. By this proceeding he rather irritated than\r\nintimidated his violent temper: so much the more vigorously did he\r\noppose the law, annoyed the commons, and persecuted the tribunes, as it\r\nwere by a regular war. The prosecutor suffered the accused to rush on\r\nheadlong, and to heighten the charges against him by the flame and\r\nmaterial of the popular odium thus incurred: in the mean time he\r\nproceeded with the law, not so much in the hope of carrying it through,\r\nas to provoke the temerity of Cæso. There many inconsiderate expressions\r\nand actions passing among the young men, are charged on the temper of\r\nCæso, through the prejudice raised against him; still the law was\r\nresisted. And Aulus Virginius frequently remarks to the people, \"Are you\r\neven now sensible that you cannot have Cæso, as a fellow-citizen, with\r\nthe law which you desire? Though why do I say law? he is an opponent of\r\nyour liberty; he surpasses all the Tarquins in arrogance. Wait till he\r\nis made consul or dictator, whom, though but a private citizen, you now\r\nsee exercising kingly sway over you by his strength and audacity.\" Many\r\nassented, complaining that they had been beaten by him: and strongly\r\nurged on the tribune to go through with the prosecution.\r\n\r\n12. The day of trial now approached, and it was evident that persons in\r\ngeneral considered that their liberty depended on the condemnation of\r\nCæso: then, at length being forced to it, he addressed the commons\r\nindividually, though with a strong feeling of indignation; his relatives\r\nfollowed him, the principal members of the state. Titus Quintius\r\nCapitolinus, who had been thrice consul, after he recounted many\r\nsplendid achievements of his own, and of his family, stated, that\r\nneither in the Quintian family, nor in the Roman state, had there\r\nappeared such promising genius of such early valour. \"That he had first\r\nbeen his soldier, that he had often in his sight fought against the\r\nenemy.\" Spurius Furius declared, that \"he having been sent to him by\r\nQuintius Capitolinus, had come to his aid when in the midst of danger;\r\nthat there was no individual by whose exertions he considered the common\r\nweal more effectually re-established.\" Lucius Lucretius, the consul of\r\nthe preceding year, in the full splendour of recent glory, shared his\r\nown services with Cæso; he recounted his battles, detailed his\r\ndistinguished exploits, both on expeditions and in the field; he advised\r\nand recommended that they would prefer this extraordinary young man,\r\nendowed with all the advantages of nature and of rank, and (one who\r\nwould prove) of the utmost importance to the interest of that state into\r\nwhich he should come, to be their fellow-citizen, rather than the\r\ncitizen of a foreign state. \"That with respect to that which may be\r\noffensive in him, heat and vehemence, time would diminish daily; that\r\nthe prudence, which may be wanting in him, was increasing daily; that as\r\nhis faults were declining and his virtues ripening to maturity, they\r\nshould allow so distinguished a man to become old in their state.\" Among\r\nthese his father, Lucius Quintius, who bore the surname of Cincinnatus,\r\nwithout dwelling on his merits, lest he should heighten public hatred,\r\nbut soliciting pardon for his errors and his youth, implored of them to\r\nforgive his son for his sake, who had not given offence to any one by\r\neither word or deed. But some, through respect or fear, turned away from\r\nlistening to his entreaties; others complaining that themselves and\r\ntheir friends had been ill-treated, by the harshness of their answer\r\ndeclared their sentence beforehand.\r\n\r\n13. Independently of the general odium, one charge bore heavily on the\r\naccused; that Marcus Volscius Fictor, who some years before had been\r\ntribune of the people, had come forward as a witness: \"that not long\r\nafter the pestilence had been in the city, he had fallen in with a party\r\nof young men rioting in the Suburra; that a scuffle arose there; and\r\nthat his elder brother, not yet perfectly recovered from his illness,\r\nhad fallen down almost dead, being struck with the fist by Cæso; that he\r\nwas carried home between the hands of some persons, and that he\r\nconsidered that he died from that blow; and that it had not been\r\npermitted to him by the consuls of former years to follow up the\r\nmatter.\" In consequence of Volscius vociferating these charges, the\r\npeople became so excited, that Cæso was near being killed through the\r\nviolence of the people. Virginius orders him to be seized and carried to\r\nprison. The patricians oppose force to force. Titus Quintius exclaims,\r\n\"that a person for whom a day of trial for a capital offence has been\r\nappointed, and whose trial was now at hand, ought not to be outraged\r\nbefore trial and without sentence being passed.\" The tribune says, \"that\r\nhe would not inflict punishment[117] on him before condemnation, that he\r\nwould however keep him in prison until the day of trial; that the Roman\r\npeople may have an opportunity of inflicting punishment on one who had\r\nkilled a man.\" The tribunes being appealed to, secure their prerogative\r\nby adopting a middle course;[118] they forbid his being thrown into\r\nconfinement, and declare it to be their wish that the accused should\r\nappear on his trial, and that a sum of money should be promised to the\r\npeople, in case he should not appear. How large a sum of money ought to\r\nbe promised, came under discussion: that is referred to the senate. The\r\naccused was detained in the public assembly, until the patricians should\r\nbe consulted: it was determined that he should give bail:[119] each bail\r\nthey bound to the amount of three thousand _asses_; how many should be\r\ngiven, was left to the tribunes; they limited the number to ten; for ten\r\nsureties the prosecutor discharged the accused. He was the first who\r\ngave public sureties. Being discharged from the forum, he went the\r\nfollowing night into exile among the Etrurians. When on the day of trial\r\nit was pleaded that he had quitted his home in order to go into exile,\r\nVirginius notwithstanding holding the comitia, his colleagues when\r\nappealed to dismissed the assembly: the fine was rigorously exacted[120]\r\nfrom the father; so that after selling all his effects, he lived for a\r\nconsiderable time in a solitary cottage on the other side of the Tiber,\r\nas if in exile. This trial and the proposing of the law gave full\r\nemployment to the state: there was quiet from foreign arms.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 117: Niebuhr denies that the tribunes had the power before the\r\nestablishment of the decemviri to commit patricians to prison. See\r\nhowever Dion. vii. 17.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 118: In the original the words are, _Medio decreto jus auxilii\r\nsui expediunt_. The tribunes were afraid lest, if they allowed Cæso to\r\ngo entirely at large, the commons might become irritated; whilst if they\r\nrefused to listen to the application of a patrician when he craved their\r\nassistance, they feared lest they should lose an excellent opportunity\r\nof establishing their influence and increasing their power. By adopting\r\na line of conduct then which conceded something both to the commons and\r\nto Cæso, they as it were _extricate_ (expediunt) their power from this\r\ndouble danger.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 119: _Vadis publicos_. According to Gronovius, _publico_,\r\nscil. _plebi_. Niebuhr prefers this reading.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 120: _Rigorously exacted_. See Niebuhr ii. p. 289, who\r\nexpresses a different opinion on the matter.]\r\n\r\n14. When the tribunes, flushed as it were with victory, imagined that\r\nthe law was in a manner passed, the patricians being now dismayed by the\r\nbanishment of Cæso, and when, with respect to the seniors of the\r\npatricians, they had relinquished all share in the administration of the\r\ncommonwealth; the juniors, more especially those who were the intimate\r\nfriends of Cæso, redoubled their resentful feelings against the\r\ncommons, and suffered not their spirits to droop; but the greatest\r\nimprovement was made in this particular, that they tempered their\r\nanimosity by a certain degree of moderation. When for the first time\r\nafter Cæso's banishment the law began to be brought forward, arrayed and\r\nwell prepared with a numerous body of clients, they attacked the\r\ntribunes, on their affording a pretext for it by attempting to remove\r\nthem, in such a manner, that no one individual carried home from thence\r\nany prominent share either of glory or ill-will; the people complained\r\nthat for one Cæso a thousand had started up. During the intermediate\r\ndays, when the tribunes made no stir regarding the law, nothing could be\r\nmore mild or peaceable than those same persons; they saluted the\r\nplebeians courteously, entered into conversation, and invited them home;\r\nthey attended the forum, and suffered the tribunes themselves to hold\r\ntheir meetings without interruption: they never were uncivil to any one\r\neither in public or in private, unless when the business respecting the\r\nlaw began to be agitated. On other occasions the young men were popular.\r\nAnd not only did the tribunes transact all their other affairs without\r\ndisturbance, but they were even re-elected for the following year,\r\nwithout one offensive expression, much less any violence being employed.\r\nBy soothing and managing the commons they gradually rendered them\r\ntractable. By these methods the law was evaded for the entire year.\r\n\r\n15. The consuls Caius Claudius, the son of Appius, and Publius Valerius\r\nPublicola, found the state in a more tranquil condition. The new year\r\nhad brought with it nothing new; the thoughts about carrying the law, or\r\nsubmitting to it, engrossed all the members of the state. The more the\r\nyounger members of the senate endeavoured to insinuate themselves into\r\nfavour with the commons, the more strenuously did the tribunes strive to\r\nthwart them, so that they rendered them suspicious in the eyes of the\r\ncommons by alleging: \"that a conspiracy was formed; that Cæso was in\r\nRome; that plans were concerted for assassinating the tribunes, and\r\nbutchering the commons. That the commission assigned by the elder\r\nmembers of the patricians was, that the young men should abolish the\r\ntribunitian power from the state, and the form of government should be\r\nthe same as it had been before the sacred mount had been taken\r\npossession of.\" Both a war from the Volsci and Æqui, which was now a\r\nstated thing, and one that was a regular occurrence for almost every\r\nyear, was apprehended, and another evil nearer home started up\r\nunexpectedly. The exiles and slaves to the number of four thousand and\r\nfive hundred men took possession of the Capitol and citadel during the\r\nnight, under the command of Appius Herdonius, a Sabine. Immediately a\r\nmassacre took place in the citadel of those who had evinced an\r\nunwillingness to enter into the conspiracy and to take up arms. Some,\r\nduring the alarm, run down to the forum, driven precipitately through\r\nthe panic; the cries, \"to arms,\" and \"the enemy are in the city,\" were\r\nheard alternately. The consuls were both afraid to arm the commons, and\r\nto suffer them to remain unarmed; uncertain what sudden calamity had\r\nassailed the city, whether external or intestine, whether from the\r\nhatred of the commons or the treachery of the slaves: they were for\r\nquieting the tumults, by such endeavours they sometimes exasperated\r\nthem; for the populace, panic-stricken and terrified, could not be\r\ndirected by authority. They give out arms, however, not\r\nindiscriminately; only so that, the enemy being still uncertain,[121]\r\nthere might be a protection sufficient to be relied on for all\r\nemergencies. The remainder of the night they passed in posting guards\r\nthrough proper places through the entire city, anxious and uncertain, as\r\nto who the persons might be, and how great the number of the enemy was.\r\nDay-light then disclosed the war and the leader of the war. Appius\r\nHerdonius summoned the slaves to liberty from the Capitol: \"that he had\r\nespoused the cause of every most unfortunate individual, in order to\r\nbring back to their country those driven out by oppression, and to\r\nremove the grievous yoke from the slaves. That he had rather that were\r\ndone under the authority of the Roman people. If there be no hope in\r\nthat quarter, that he would rouse the Volscians and Æqui, and would try\r\nall extremities.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 121: _Incerto hoste_, it being as yet uncertain who the enemy\r\nwas.]\r\n\r\n16. The matter began to disclose itself more clearly to the patricians\r\nand the consuls; besides those things, however, which were openly\r\ndeclared, they dreaded lest this might be a scheme of the Veientes or\r\nSabines; and, as there were so many of the enemy in the city, lest the\r\nSabine and Etrurian troops might come on according to a concerted plan;\r\nand then lest their eternal enemies, the Volscians and Æqui, should\r\ncome, not to ravage their territories, as before, but to their very\r\ncity, already in part taken. Many and various were their fears; among\r\nothers, the most prominent was their dread of the slaves, lest each\r\nmight harbour an enemy in his own house, one whom it was neither\r\nsufficiently safe to trust, nor to deny[122] confidence to him lest, by\r\nnot trusting him, he might become more incensed. And (the evil) seemed\r\nscarcely capable of being resisted by perfect harmony (between the\r\ndifferent orders of the state); only no one apprehended the tribunes or\r\ncommons, other evils predominating and constantly starting up; that\r\nappeared an evil of a mild nature, and one always arising during the\r\ncessation of other evils, and it then appeared to be lulled to rest by\r\nexternal terror. Yet that was almost the only one that most aggravated\r\ntheir distressing circumstances: for such madness took possession of the\r\ntribunes, that they contended that not war, but the empty appearance of\r\nwar had taken possession of the Capitol, to avert the people's minds\r\nfrom attending to the law; that these friends and clients of the\r\npatricians would depart in greater silence than they came, if they once\r\nperceived that, by the law being passed, they had raised these tumults\r\nin vain. They then held a meeting for passing the law, having called\r\naway the people from their arms. In the mean time, the consuls convene\r\nthe senate, another dread presenting itself on the part of the tribunes,\r\ngreater than that which the nightly foe had occasioned.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 122: _Fidem abrogare_,--non habere fidem, non credere. _Non\r\ncredendo_ here seems superfluous.]\r\n\r\n17. When it was announced that their arms were being laid aside, and\r\nthat the men were quitting their posts, Publius Valerius, his colleague\r\nstill detaining the senate, hastens from the senate-house; he comes\r\nthence into the meeting to the tribunes: \"What is all this,\" says he,\r\n\"tribunes? Are you determined to overthrow the commonwealth under the\r\nguidance and auspices of Appius Herdonius? Has he been so successful in\r\ncorrupting you, who, by his authority, has not influenced your slaves?\r\nWhen the enemies are over our heads, is it your pleasure that arms\r\nshould be given up, and laws be proposed?\" Then directing his discourse\r\nto the populace: \"If, Romans, no concern for your city, for yourselves,\r\nmoves you, at least revere the gods of your country, now made captive by\r\nthe enemy. Jupiter, the best and greatest, Queen Juno, and Minerva, the\r\nother gods and goddesses, are besieged; the camp of slaves now holds the\r\ntutelary gods of the state. Does this seem to you the form of a state in\r\nits senses? Such a crowd of enemies is not only within the walls, but in\r\nthe citadel, commanding the forum and senate-house: in the mean while\r\nmeetings are being held in the forum; the senate is in the senate-house,\r\njust as when perfect tranquillity prevails; the senator gives his\r\nopinion, the other Romans give their votes. Would it not behove all the\r\npatricians and commons, consuls, tribunes, citizens, and all classes of\r\npersons, to bring aid with arms in their hands, to run into the Capitol,\r\nto liberate and restore to peace that most august residence of Jupiter,\r\nthe best and greatest? O Father Romulus! do thou infuse into thy progeny\r\nthat determination of thine, by which you once recovered from these same\r\nSabines the citadel, when obtained by gold. Order them to pursue this\r\nsame path, which thou, as leader, and thy army, pursued. Lo! I, as\r\nconsul, shall be the first to follow thee and thy footsteps, as far as a\r\nmortal can follow a god.\" The close of his speech was: \"That he would\r\ntake up arms, that he invited every citizen of Rome to arms; if any one\r\nshould oppose, that he, [123]forgetful of the consular authority, the\r\ntribunitian power, and the devoting laws, would consider him as an\r\nenemy, whoever he may, wheresoever he may, in the Capitol, or in the\r\nforum. That the tribunes might order arms to be taken up against Publius\r\nValerius the consul, since they forbid it against Appius Herdonius; that\r\nhe would venture to act in that manner in the case of the tribunes, in\r\nwhich the founder of his family had ventured to act in the case of\r\nkings.\" It now became apparent that extreme violence was about to take\r\nplace, and that a disturbance among the Romans would be exhibited as a\r\nsight to the enemy; the law, however, could neither be prepared, nor\r\ncould the consul proceed to the Capitol: night quashed the contest that\r\nhad commenced; the tribunes yielded to the night, dreading the arms of\r\nthe consuls. The fomenters of the disturbances being removed from\r\nthence, the patricians went about among the commons, and introducing\r\nthemselves into their circles of conversation, they introduced\r\nobservations suited to the occasion: they advised them \"to beware into\r\nwhat hazard they were bringing the commonwealth; that the contest was\r\nnot between the patricians and commons, but that patricians and commons\r\ntogether, the fortress of the city, the temples of the gods, the\r\nguardian gods of the state and of private families, were being delivered\r\nup to the enemy.\" Whilst these affairs are going on in the forum for the\r\npurpose of appeasing the disturbances, the consuls in the mean time had\r\narmed the several gates and the walls, lest the Sabines or the Veientian\r\nenemy should make any move.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 123: _Forgetful of the consular, &c._--i.e. forgetful of the\r\nlimits of the consular authority; acting in the same manner as if its\r\npower were unbounded, and admitted no appeal.]\r\n\r\n18. On the same night, messengers come to Tusculum announcing that the\r\ncitadel was taken, and the Capitol seized, and the other state of\r\ndisturbance in the city. Lucius Mamilius was at that time dictator at\r\nTusculum; he, having immediately convoked the senate and introduced the\r\nmessengers, earnestly advises: \"That they should not wait until\r\nambassadors came from Rome, suing for assistance; that the very danger\r\nand risk, and the social gods, and the faith of treaties, demanded it;\r\nthat the gods would never afford them an equal opportunity of obliging\r\nso powerful a state and so near a neighbour.\" It is determined that\r\nassistance should be sent: the young men are enrolled; arms are given to\r\nthem. Coming to Rome at break of day, they at a distance exhibited the\r\nappearance of enemies. The Æqui or Volscians appeared to be coming. Then\r\nwhen the groundless alarm was removed, they are admitted into the city,\r\nand descend in a body into the forum. There Publius Valerius, having\r\nleft his colleague to guard the gates, was now drawing up in order of\r\nbattle. The great influence of the man had produced an effect, when he\r\naffirmed that, \"the Capitol being recovered, and the city restored to\r\npeace, if they would allow themselves to be convinced what lurking fraud\r\nwas concealed under the law proposed by the tribunes, that he would\r\noffer no obstruction to the meeting of the people, mindful of his\r\nancestors, mindful of his surname, and that the province of protecting\r\nthe people had been handed down to him as hereditary by his ancestors.\"\r\nFollowing him as their leader, notwithstanding the tribunes cried out\r\nagainst it, they direct their march up the Capitoline hill. The Tusculan\r\ntroops also joined them. Allies and citizens vied with each other which\r\nof them should appropriate to themselves the honour of recovering the\r\ncitadel. Each leader encourages his own men. Then the enemy became\r\nterrified, and placed no dependence on any but the place. The Romans and\r\nallies advance on them whilst in this state of alarm. They had now\r\nbroken into the porch of the temple, when Publius Valerius is slain\r\nanimating the fight at the head of his men. Publius Volumnius, a man of\r\nconsular rank, saw him falling. Having directed his men to cover the\r\nbody, he rushes forward to the place and office of consul. Through their\r\nardour and impetuosity the perception of so heavy a blow did not reach\r\nthe soldiers; they conquered before they perceived that they conquered\r\nwithout a leader. Many of the exiles defiled the temple with their\r\nblood; many were taken alive; Herdonius was slain. Thus the Capitol was\r\nrecovered. With respect to the prisoners,[124] punishment was inflicted\r\non each according to his station, whether he was a freeman or a slave.\r\nThe commons are stated to have thrown farthings into the consul's house,\r\nthat he might be buried with greater solemnity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 124: Niebuhr thinks that Cæso was among the number. See cap.\r\n25, where we read \"Cæsonem neque Quintiæ familiæ, neque reipublicæ\r\nrestitui posse.\" Comp. Niebuhr ii. n. 673, Wachsmuth, p. 347.]\r\n\r\n19. Peace being established, the tribunes then pressed on the patricians\r\nto fulfil the promise of Publius Valerius; they pressed on Claudius, to\r\nfree the shade of his colleague from breach of faith, and to allow the\r\nbusiness of the law to proceed. The consul asserted that he would suffer\r\nthe discussion on the law to go on, till he had a colleague appointed in\r\nthe room of the deceased. These disputes held on until the elections for\r\nsubstituting a consul. In the month of December,[125] by the most\r\nzealous exertions of the patricians, Lucius Quintius Cincinnatus, Cæso's\r\nfather, is elected consul to enter on his office without delay. The\r\ncommons were dismayed at their being about to have as consul a man\r\nincensed against them, powerful by the support of the patricians, by his\r\nown merit, and by three sons, not one of whom yielded to Cæso in\r\ngreatness of spirit; \"whilst they were superior to him by their\r\nexercising prudence and moderation, when the occasion required.\" When he\r\nentered on his office, in his frequent harangues from the tribunal, he\r\nwas not more vehement in restraining the commons than in reproving the\r\nsenate, \"by the listlessness of which body the tribunes of the commons,\r\nnow become perpetual, by means of their tongues and prosecutions\r\nexercised regal authority, not as in a republic of the Roman people, but\r\nas if in an ill-regulated family. That with his son Cæso, fortitude,\r\nconstancy, all the splendid qualifications of youth in war or in peace,\r\nhad been driven and exiled from the city of Rome: that talkative and\r\nturbulent men, sowers of discord, twice and even thrice re-elected\r\ntribunes, lived in the most destructive practices with regal tyranny.\r\nDid that Aulus Virginius,\" says he, \"deserve less punishment than Appius\r\nHerdonius, because he was not in the Capitol? considerably more, by\r\nJove, (in the mind of any one) who would judge the matter fairly.\r\nHerdonius, if nothing else, by avowing himself an enemy, in a manner\r\ngave you notice to take up arms: this man, by denying the existence of\r\nwar, took arms out of your hands, and exposed you defenceless to your\r\nslaves and exiles. And did you, (without any offence to Caius Claudius\r\nand to Publius Valerius, now no more let me say it,) did you advance\r\nagainst the Capitoline hill before you expelled those enemies from the\r\nforum. It is shameful before gods and men. When the enemy were in the\r\ncitadel, in the very Capitol, when the leader of the exiles and slaves,\r\nafter profaning every thing, took up his residence in the shrine of\r\nJupiter, the best and greatest, arms were taken up in Tusculum sooner\r\nthan in Rome. It was a matter of doubt whether Lucius Mamilius, the\r\nTusculan leader, or Publius Valerius and Caius Claudius, the consuls,\r\nrecovered the Roman citadel, and we, who formerly did not suffer the\r\nLatins to touch arms, even in their own defence, when they had the enemy\r\nin their very frontiers, should have been taken and destroyed now, had\r\nnot the Latins taken up arms of their own accord. Tribunes, is this\r\nbringing aid to the commons, to expose them in a defenceless state to be\r\nbutchered by the enemy. Now, if any one, even the humblest individual of\r\nyour commons, (which portion you have as it were broken off from the\r\nrest of the state, and made it your country and peculiar commonwealth,)\r\nif any one of these persons were to bring word that his house was beset\r\nby an armed band of slaves, you would think that assistance should be\r\nafforded to him. Was Jupiter, the best and greatest, when surrounded by\r\nthe arms of exiles and of slaves, deserving of no human aid? And do\r\nthese persons require that they be considered sacred and\r\ninviolable,[126] with whom the gods themselves are neither sacred nor\r\ninviolable? But, steeped as ye are in crimes against both gods and men,\r\ndo ye say that you will pass your law this year? Verily then the day on\r\nwhich I was created consul was a disastrous day for the commonwealth,\r\nmuch more so even than that on which Publius Valerius the consul fell,\r\nif ye should carry it. Now, first of all,\" says he, \"Romans, it is the\r\nintention of myself and of my colleague to march the legions against the\r\nVolsci and the Æqui. I know not by what fatality we find the gods more\r\npropitious when we are at war than in peace. How great the danger from\r\nthose states would have been, had they known that the Capitol was\r\nbesieged by exiles, it is better to conjecture from the past, than to\r\nfeel from actual experience.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 125: The consuls under ordinary circumstances used to commence\r\ntheir office at this time on the Calends of August.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 126: _Neque sacri neque sancti_. Whatever is consecrated by\r\nreligion is said to be _sacrum_; whilst _sanctum_ is said of that which\r\nthe law states to be inviolable.]\r\n\r\n20. The consul's harangue had a great effect on the commons; the\r\npatricians, recovering their spirits, considered the state as\r\nre-established. The other consul, more eager as a seconder than as the\r\nfirst mover (of a measure), readily suffering his colleague to take the\r\nfirst lead in a matter of so much importance, claimed to himself his\r\nshare of the consular duty in executing the plan. Then the tribunes,\r\nmocking these declarations as empty, went on inquiring \"by what means\r\nthe consuls would lead out the army, as no one would allow them to hold\r\na levy?\" \"But,\" says Quintius, \"we have no occasion for a levy; since at\r\nthe time Publius Valerius gave arms to the commons to recover the\r\nCapitol, they all took an oath to him, that they would assemble on an\r\norder from the consul, and would not depart without an order. We\r\ntherefore publish our order that all of you, who have sworn, attend\r\nto-morrow under arms at the lake Regillus.\" The tribunes then began to\r\ncavil, and wished to absolve the people from their obligation; that\r\nQuintius was a private person at the time at which they were bound by\r\nthe oath. But that disregard of the gods which prevails in the present\r\nage had not yet arrived; nor did every one, by his own interpretation,\r\naccommodate oaths and laws to his own purposes, but rather adapted his\r\nconduct to them. Wherefore the tribunes, as there was no hope of\r\nobstructing the matter, attempted to delay the departure (of the army)\r\nthe more earnestly on this account, because a report had gone out \"both\r\nthat the augurs had been ordered to attend at the lake Regillus, and to\r\nconsecrate a place, where business might be transacted with the people\r\nwith the benefit of auspices; that whatever had been passed at Rome by\r\ntribunitian violence, might be repealed there in an assembly. That all\r\nwould agree to that which the consuls wished; for that there was no\r\nappeal at a distance greater than that of a mile from the city: and that\r\nthe tribunes, if they should come there, would, among the rest of the\r\ncrowd, be subjected to the consular authority.\" These matters alarmed\r\nthem; but the greatest terror which acted on their minds was, that\r\nQuintius frequently said, \"that he would not hold an election of\r\nconsuls. That the state was affected with such a disease, as could not\r\nbe stopped by the ordinary remedies. That the commonwealth required a\r\ndictator, so that whoever should stir a step to disturb the peace of the\r\nstate, might feel that the dictatorship was without appeal.\"\r\n\r\n21. The senate was assembled in the Capitol. Thither the tribunes come\r\nwith the commons in great consternation: the populace, with loud\r\nclamours, implore the protection now of the consuls, now of the\r\npatricians: nor could they make the consul recede from his\r\ndetermination, until the tribunes promised that they would be under the\r\ndirection of the patricians. Then on the consul's laying before them the\r\ndemands of the tribunes and commons, decrees of the senate are passed,\r\n\"That neither the tribunes should propose the law during that year, and\r\nthat the consuls should not lead the army from the city--that for the\r\ntime to come, the senate decided that it was to the injury of the\r\ncommonwealth, that the same magistrates should be continued, and the\r\nsame tribunes be re-appointed.\" The consuls conformed to the authority\r\nof the senate, the tribunes were re-appointed notwithstanding the\r\nremonstrances of the consuls. The patricians also, that they might not\r\nyield to the commons in any particular, re-elected Lucius Quintius\r\nconsul. No proceeding of the consul was urged with more warmth during\r\nthe entire year. \"Can I be surprised,\" says he, \"if your authority is of\r\nlittle weight, conscript fathers? yourselves are disparaging it.\r\nForsooth, because the commons have violated a decree of the senate, by\r\nre-appointing their magistrates, you yourselves also wish it to be\r\nviolated, lest ye should yield to the populace in rashness; as if to\r\npossess greater power in the state consisted in having more of\r\ninconstancy and irregularity; for it is certainly more inconstant and\r\ngreater folly, to do away with one's own decrees and resolutions, than\r\nthose of others. Imitate, conscript fathers, the inconsiderate\r\nmultitude; and ye, who should be an example to others, transgress by the\r\nexample of others, rather than others should act correctly by yours,\r\nprovided I imitate not the tribunes, nor suffer myself to be re-elected\r\nconsul, contrary to a decree of the senate. But I advise you, Caius\r\nClaudius, that both you on your part restrain the Roman people from this\r\nlicentiousness, and that you be persuaded of this on my part, that I\r\nshall so take it, as not to consider that my honour has been obstructed\r\nby you, but that the glory of declining the honour has been augmented,\r\nand the odium, which would hang over me from its being continued, has\r\nbeen lessened.\" Upon this they issue this order jointly: \"That no one\r\nshould attempt to make Lucius Quintius consul: if any one should do so,\r\nthat they would not allow that vote.\"\r\n\r\n22. The consuls elected were Quintus Fabius Vibulanus, a third time, and\r\nLucius Cornelius Maluginensis. The census was performed that year; it\r\nwas a matter of religious scruple that the lustrum should be closed, on\r\naccount of the Capitol having been taken and the consul slain. In the\r\nconsulate of Quintus Fabius and Lucius Cornelius, disturbances broke out\r\nimmediately at the commencement of the year. The tribunes were urging on\r\nthe commons. The Latins and Hernici brought word that a formidable war\r\nwas in preparation on the part of the Volscians and Æqui; that the\r\ntroops of the Volscians were now at Antium. Great apprehension was also\r\nentertained, that the colony itself would revolt: and with difficulty\r\nwere the tribunes prevailed on to allow the war to take precedence. The\r\nconsuls then divided the provinces between them. It was assigned to\r\nFabius to march the legions to Antium; to Cornelius, to protect the\r\ncity; lest any part of the enemy, as was the practice of the Æqui,\r\nshould come to commit depredations. The Hernici and Latins were ordered\r\nto supply soldiers in conformity to the treaty; and in the army two\r\nparts consisted of allies, one part of natives. When the allies came to\r\nthe day already appointed, the consul pitches his camp outside the\r\nCapuan gate. Then, after the army was purified, he set out for Antium,\r\nand encamped not far from the town, and standing camp of the enemy.\r\nWhere, when the Volscians, not venturing to risk an engagement, were\r\npreparing to protect themselves quietly within their ramparts, on the\r\nfollowing day Fabius drew up not one mixed army of allies and citizens,\r\nbut three separate bodies of the three states around the enemy's works.\r\nHe himself was in the centre with the Roman legions. He ordered them to\r\nwatch for the signal from thence, so that the allies might both commence\r\nthe action together, and retire together, if he should sound a retreat.\r\nHe placed their cavalry in the rear of each division. Having thus\r\nassailed the camp in three different points, he surrounds it; and when\r\nhe pressed on from every side, he dislodges from the rampart the\r\nVolscians, not able to sustain his attack. Having then crossed the\r\nfortifications, he expels from the camp the crowd who were dismayed and\r\ninclining towards one direction. Upon this the cavalry, who could not\r\neasily pass over the rampart, having stood by up to that period mere\r\nspectators of the fight, having come up with them whilst flying in\r\ndisorder on the open plain, enjoys a share of the victory, by cutting\r\ndown the affrighted troops. The slaughter of them as they fled was\r\ngreat, both in the camp and outside the lines; but the booty was still\r\ngreater, because the enemy were scarcely able to carry off their arms\r\nwith them; and their entire army would have been destroyed, had not the\r\nwoods covered them in their flight.\r\n\r\n23. Whilst these transactions are taking place at Antium, the Æqui, in\r\nthe mean while, sending forward the main strength of their youth,\r\nsurprise the citadel of Tusculum by night, and with the rest of their\r\narmy they sit down at no great distance from the walls of Tusculum, so\r\nas to divide the forces of the enemy. This account being quickly brought\r\nto Rome, and from Rome to Antium, affect the Romans not less than if it\r\nwas told them that the Capitol was taken; so recent were both the\r\nservices of the Tusculans, and the very similitude of the danger seemed\r\nto require a return of the aid that had been afforded. Fabius, giving up\r\nevery other object, removes the booty hastily from the camp to Antium.\r\nHaving a small garrison there, he hurries on his army by forced marches\r\nto Tusculum. The soldiers were allowed to carry nothing but their arms,\r\nand whatever dressed provision was at hand. The consul Cornelius sends\r\nprovisions from Rome. The war was carried on at Tusculum for several\r\nmonths. With one part of his army the consul assailed the camp of the\r\nÆqui; a part he had given to the Tusculans to recover their citadel.\r\nThey never could have made their way to it by force. Famine at length\r\nwithdrew the enemy from it. And when they came to this at last, they\r\nwere all sent under the yoke by the Tusculans, unarmed and naked. These,\r\nwhen betaking themselves home by an ignominious flight, were overtaken\r\nby the Roman consul on Algidum and cut off to a man. After this victory,\r\nhaving marched back[127] his army to Columen, (that is the name of the\r\nplace,) he pitches his camp. The other consul also, as soon as the Roman\r\nwalls ceased to be in danger, the enemy being defeated, set out from\r\nRome. Thus the consuls, having entered the territories of the enemies on\r\ntwo different sides, strenuously vie with each other in depopulating the\r\nVolscians on the one hand, the Æqui on the other. I find in some writers\r\nthat the people of Antium revolted[128] the same year. That Lucius\r\nCornelius, the consul, conducted that war and took the town, I would not\r\nventure to affirm for certain, because no mention is made of the matter\r\namong the older writers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 127: _Exercitu relicto_ is the ordinary reading. Crevier\r\nobserves that _reducto_ is the more correct.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 128: This account does not seem to be correct. See Niebuhr ii.\r\np. 254.]\r\n\r\n24. This war being concluded, a tribunitian war at home alarms the\r\nsenate. They exclaim, \"that the detaining the army abroad was done for a\r\nfraudulent motive: that such frustration was for the purpose of doing\r\naway with the law; that they, however, would go through with the matter\r\nundertaken by them.\" Publius Lucretius, however, the præfect of the\r\ncity, so far prevailed that the proceedings of the tribunes were\r\npostponed till the arrival of the consuls. A new cause of disturbance\r\nalso arose. Aulus Cornelius and Quintus Servilius, quæstors, appoint a\r\nday of trial for Marcus Volscius, because he had come forward as a\r\nmanifestly false witness against Cæso. For it appeared by many proofs,\r\nthat the brother of Volscius, from the time he first became ill, not\r\nonly never appeared in public, but that he had not even arisen from his\r\nsick bed, and that he died of an illness of several months' standing;\r\nand that at the time to which the witness had referred the commission of\r\nthe crime, Cæso had not been seen at Rome: those who served in the army\r\nwith him, positively stating that at that time he had constantly\r\nattended at his post with them without any leave of absence. Many\r\npersons proposed on their own private responsibility to Volscius to have\r\na judicial decision on the matter.[129] As he would not venture to go to\r\ntrial, all these matters coinciding rendered the condemnation of\r\nVolscius no less certain than that of Cæso had been on the testimony of\r\nVolscius. The tribunes occasioned a delay, who said that they would not\r\nsuffer the quæstors to hold the assembly[130] concerning the accused,\r\nunless it was first held concerning the law. Thus both matters were spun\r\nout till the arrival of the consuls. When they entered the city in\r\ntriumph with their victorious army, because silence was (observed) with\r\nregard to the law, many thought that the tribunes were struck with\r\ndismay. But they, (for it was now the close of the year,) desirous of\r\nobtaining a fourth tribuneship, had turned away their efforts from the\r\nlaw to canvassing for the elections; and when the consuls strove with no\r\nless strenuousness than if the law in question were proposed for the\r\npurpose of lessening their own dignity, the victory in the contest was\r\non the side of the tribunes. On the same year peace was granted to the\r\nÆqui on their suing for it. The census, a matter commenced on the\r\npreceding year, is completed. The number of citizens rated were one\r\nhundred and seventeen thousand three hundred and nineteen. The consuls\r\nobtained great glory this year both at home and in war, because they\r\nboth re-established peace abroad and at home; though the state was not\r\nin a state of absolute concord, yet it was less disturbed than at other\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 129: _Ni ita esset_, a legal form of expression, amounting in\r\nthis place to \"if Volscius attempted to deny it.\" _Privatim_. Besides\r\nthe quæstors who by virtue of their office were to prosecute Volscius,\r\nmany persons on their own account, and on their private responsibility,\r\ncited him into court, and challenged him to discuss the case before a\r\njudge. A prosecutor was said _ferre judicem res_, when he proposed to\r\nthe accused person some one out of the _judices selecti_, before whom\r\nthe case might be tried; if the accused person consented to the person\r\nnamed by prosecutor, then the judge was said _convenisse_, to have been\r\nagreed on. Sometimes the accused was allowed to select his own judge,\r\n_judicem dicere_. When both the prosecutor and the accused agreed as to\r\nthe judge, they presented a joint petition to the prætor that he would\r\nappoint (_ut daret_) that person to try the cause; at the same time they\r\nboth bound themselves to pay a certain sum, the one if he did not\r\nestablish his charge, _ni ita esset_; the other if he did not prove his\r\ninnocence.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 130: _Comitia_, i. e. _curiata_, which exercised authority in\r\nthe cases of persons accused of inflicting injuries on the patricians.]\r\n\r\n25. Lucius Minucius and Caius Nautius being next elected consuls, took\r\nup the two causes which lay over since the preceding year. The consuls\r\nobstructed the law, the tribunes the trial of Volscius in the same\r\nmanner: but in the new quæstors there was greater power, and greater\r\ninfluence. With Marcus Valerius, son of Valerius and grandson of\r\nVolesus, Titus Quintius Capitolinus, who had been thrice consul, was\r\nappointed quæstor. Since Cæso could neither be restored to the Quintian\r\nfamily, nor could he, though a most promising young man, be restored to\r\nthe state, he justly, and as in duty bound, prosecuted the false witness\r\nwho had deprived an innocent person of the power of pleading his cause.\r\nWhen Virginius in particular and the (other) tribunes were promoting the\r\npassing of the law, the space of two months was allowed to the consuls\r\nto examine into the law: so that, when they had satisfied the people, as\r\nto what secret designs were concealed under it, they should then allow\r\nthem to give their votes. The granting this respite established\r\ntranquillity in the city. The Æqui however did not allow them long rest;\r\nwho, in violation of the treaty which had been made with the Romans the\r\nyear before, confer the chief command on Gracchus Clælius. He was then\r\nthe leading man amongst the Æqui. Under the command of Gracchus they\r\ncarry hostile depredations into the district of Lavici, from thence into\r\nthat of Tusculum, and laden with booty they pitch their camp at Algidum.\r\nTo that camp Quintus Fabius, Publius Volumnius, Aulus Posthumius, come\r\nto complain of the wrongs committed, and to demand restitution in\r\naccordance with the treaty. The general of the Æqui commands them \"to\r\ndeliver to the oak whatever instructions they brought from the Roman\r\nsenate; that he in the mean time should attend to other matters.\" A\r\nlarge oak tree hung over the prætorium, the shade of which constituted a\r\npleasant seat. Then one of the ambassadors, when departing, says, \"Let\r\nboth this consecrated oak and all the gods hear the treaty violated by\r\nyou, and favour both our complaints now, and our arms presently, when we\r\nshall simultaneously avenge the rights of gods and men as violated by\r\nyou.\" As soon as the ambassadors returned to Rome, the senate ordered\r\none of the consuls to lead his army against Gracchus at Algidum, to the\r\nother they assigned as his province the laying waste of the country of\r\nthe Æqui. The tribunes, according to their practice, attempted to\r\nobstruct the levy; and probably would have eventually prevented it, but\r\na new cause of alarm was suddenly added.\r\n\r\n26. A large body of Sabines, committing dreadful devastation, approached\r\nvery close to the walls of the city. The fields were laid waste, the\r\ncity was struck with terror. Then the commons cheerfully took up arms;\r\ntwo large armies were raised, the tribunes remonstrating to no purpose.\r\nNautius led the one against the Sabines; and having pitched his camp at\r\nEretum, by small detachments, generally by nightly incursions, he\r\neffected such desolation in the Sabine land, that, when compared to it,\r\nthe Roman territories seemed intact by an enemy. Minucius had neither\r\nthe same success nor the same energy of mind in conducting his business;\r\nfor after he had pitched his camp at no great distance from the enemy,\r\nwithout having experienced any considerable loss, he kept himself\r\nthrough fear within the camp. When the enemy perceived this, their\r\nboldness increased, as sometimes happens, from others' fears; and having\r\nattacked his camp by night, when open force did not succeed well, they\r\non the following day drew lines of circumvallation around it. Before\r\nthese could close up all the passes, by a vallum being thrown up on all\r\nsides, five horsemen being despatched between the enemies' posts,\r\nbrought the account to Rome, that the consul and his army were besieged.\r\nNothing could have happened so unexpected, nor so unlooked-for.\r\nAccordingly the panic and the alarm was as great as if the enemy\r\nbesieged the city, not the camp. They send for the consul Nautius; in\r\nwhom when there seemed to be but insufficient protection, and they were\r\ndetermined that a dictator should be appointed to retrieve their\r\nembarrassed affairs, Lucius Quintius Cincinnatus is appointed by\r\nuniversal consent. It is worth those persons' while to listen, who\r\ndespise all things human in comparison with riches, and who suppose\r\n\"that there is no room for exalted honour, nor for virtue, unless where\r\nriches abound in great profusion.\" Lucius Quintius, the sole hope of the\r\nRoman people, cultivated a farm of four acres, at the other side of the\r\nTiber, which are called the Quintian meadows, opposite to the very place\r\nwhere the dock-yard now is. There, whether leaning on a stake in a ditch\r\nwhich he was digging, or in the employment of ploughing, engaged at\r\nleast on some rural work, as is certain, after mutual salutations had\r\npassed, being requested by the ambassadors to put on his gown, and\r\nlisten to the commands of the senate, (with wishes) that it might be\r\nhappy both to him and to the commonwealth, being astonished, and asking\r\nfrequently \"whether all was safe,\" he bids his wife Racilia immediately\r\nto bring his toga from his hut. As soon as he put this on and came\r\nforward, after first wiping off the dust and sweat, the ambassadors,\r\ncongratulating him, unite in saluting him as dictator: they call him\r\ninto the city; explain to him what terror now exists in the army. A\r\nvessel was prepared for Quintius by order of government, and his three\r\nsons having come out to meet him, receive him on his landing at the\r\nother side; then his other relatives and friends; then the greater part\r\nof the patricians. Accompanied by this numerous attendance, and the\r\nlictors going before him, he was conducted to his residence. There was a\r\nnumerous concourse of the commons also; but they by no means looked on\r\nQuintius with equal pleasure, considering both the extent of his\r\nauthority as too great, and the man vested with such authority rather\r\narbitrary. And during that night indeed nothing was done in the city\r\nbesides posting guards.\r\n\r\n27. On the next day the dictator, after he had come into the forum\r\nbefore day-light, names a master of the horse, Lucius Tarquitius, a man\r\nof patrician family, but one who, though he had served his campaigns\r\namong the foot by reason of his scanty means, was yet considered by many\r\ndegrees the first in military skill among the Roman youth. With his\r\nmaster of the horse he came into the assembly, proclaims a suspension of\r\ncivil business, orders the shops to be closed throughout the city, and\r\nforbids any one to attend to any private affairs. Then he commands that\r\nall, whoever were of the military age, should attend under arms, in the\r\nCampus Martius, before sun-set, with dressed provisions for five days\r\nand twelve palisades, and he commanded that whose age was too far\r\nadvanced for military service, should dress their victuals for the\r\nsoldiers in their vicinity, whilst the latter were preparing arms, and\r\nprocuring the palisade. Accordingly, the young men run in different\r\ndirections to procure the palisades; they took them wherever they were\r\nnearest to them; no one was prevented, and they all attended punctually\r\naccording to the dictator's order. Then the troops being formed, not\r\nmore fitted for the march than for an engagement, should the occasion\r\nrequire it, the dictator himself marches at the head of the legions, the\r\nmaster of the horse at the head of his cavalry. In both bodies there\r\nwere such exhortations as the juncture itself required; that \"they\r\nshould quicken their pace; that there was need of expedition, that they\r\nmight reach the enemy by night; that the consul and the Romans were\r\nbesieged; that they had been shut up now three days: that it was\r\nuncertain what each day or night might bring with it; that the issue of\r\nthe most important affairs often depended on a moment of time.\" They, to\r\nplease their leaders, exclaimed among themselves, \"Standard-bearer,\r\nhasten on; follow, soldier.\" At midnight they reach Algidum: and, as\r\nsoon as they perceived that they were near the enemy, they halted.\r\n\r\n28. There the dictator, having rode about, and having observed, as far\r\nas could be ascertained by night, what the situation of the camp was,\r\nand what its form, commanded the tribunes of the soldiers to order the\r\nbaggage to be thrown into one place, and that the soldiers with their\r\narms and palisades should return to their ranks. What he commanded was\r\nexecuted. Then, with the regularity which they had observed on the\r\nmarch, he draws the entire army in a long column around the enemies'\r\ncamp, and directs that, when the signal was given, they should all raise\r\na shout; and that on the shout being raised, each man should throw up a\r\ntrench before his post, and fix his palisade. The orders being issued,\r\nthe signal followed: the soldiers perform what they were commanded; the\r\nshout resounds around the enemy: it then passes beyond the camp of the\r\nenemy, and reaches the consul's camp: it occasions panic in one place,\r\ngreat joy in another. The Romans, observing to each other with\r\nexultation, \"that this was the shout of their countrymen, and that aid\r\nwas at hand,\" from their watch-guards and out-posts intimidate the enemy\r\non their part. The consul says, that there must be no delay: \"that by\r\nthat shout not only their arrival was intimated, but that proceedings\r\nwere already commenced by their friends; and that it would be a wonder\r\nif the enemies' camp were not attacked on the outside.\" He therefore\r\norders his men to take up arms and follow him. The battle was commenced\r\nby the legions during the night: they give notice to the dictator by a\r\nshout, that on that side also the action was commenced. The Æquans were\r\nnow preparing to prevent the works from being brought around them,[131]\r\nwhen, the battle being commenced by the enemy from within, turning their\r\nattention from those employed on the fortifications to those who were\r\nfighting on the inside, lest a sally should be made through the centre\r\nof their camp, they left the night to remain without interruption for\r\nthe finishing of the work; and they continued the fight with the consul\r\ntill daylight. At the break of day they were now encompassed by the\r\ndictator's works, and were scarcely able to maintain the fight against\r\none army. Then their lines were attacked by Quintius's army, who\r\nimmediately after completing their work returned to their arms. Here a\r\nnew fight pressed on them: the former one had suffered no relaxation.\r\nThen the twofold peril pressing hard on them, turning from fighting to\r\nentreaties, they implored the dictator on the one hand, the consul on\r\nthe other, not to make the victory consist in their general slaughter,\r\nthat they would suffer them to depart without arms. When they were bid\r\nby the consul to go to the dictator, he, incensed against them, added\r\nignominy (to defeat). He orders Gracchus Cloelius, their general, and\r\nother leaders to be brought to him in chains, and that they should\r\nevacuate the town of Corbio; \"that he wanted not the blood of the\r\nÆquans: that they were allowed to depart; but that the confession may be\r\nat length extorted, that their nation was defeated and subdued, that\r\nthey should pass under the yoke.\" The yoke is formed with three spears,\r\ntwo fixed in the ground, and one tied across between the upper ends of\r\nthem. Under this yoke the dictator sent the Æquans.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 131: _Ad prohibenda circumdari opera_. Stroth observes that it\r\nshould be more properly _ad prohibenda circumdanda opera_, i. e. ad\r\nprohibendum, ne opera circumdarentur.]\r\n\r\n29. The enemy's camp being taken, which was full of every thing, (for he\r\nhad sent them away naked,) he distributed all the booty among his own\r\nsoldiers only: chiding the consul's army and the consul himself, he\r\nsays, \"Soldiers, ye shall do without any portion of the spoil taken from\r\nthat enemy to which you were well nigh becoming a spoil: and you, Lucius\r\nMinutius, until you begin to assume the spirit of a consul, shall\r\ncommand these legions as lieutenant-general.\" Minutius accordingly\r\nresigns his office of consul, and remains with the army, as he had been\r\ncommanded. But so meekly obedient were the minds of men at that time to\r\nauthority combined with superior merit, that this army, mindful of the\r\nkindness (conferred) rather than of the slur (cast on them), both voted\r\na golden crown of a pound weight to the dictator, and saluted him as\r\ntheir patron when setting out. The senate at Rome, being convened by\r\nQuintus Fabius, præfect of the city, ordered Quintius to enter the city\r\nin triumph, in the order of march in which he was coming. The leaders of\r\nthe enemy were led before his car: the military standards were carried\r\nbefore him: his army followed laden with spoil. Tables with provisions\r\nare said to have been laid out before the houses of all, and (the\r\nsoldiers) partaking of the entertainment, followed the car with the\r\ntriumphal hymn and the usual jests, after the manner of revellers. On\r\nthat day the freedom of the state was granted to Lucius Mamilius of\r\nTusculum, with universal approbation. The dictator would have laid down\r\nhis office, had not the assembly for the trial of Marcus Volscius, the\r\nfalse witness, detained him; the fear of the dictator prevented the\r\ntribunes from obstructing it. Volscius was condemned and went into exile\r\nto Lanuvium. Quintius laid down his dictatorship on the sixteenth day,\r\nhaving received it for six months. During those days the consul Nautius\r\nengages the Sabines at Eretum with distinguished success. Besides the\r\ndevastation of their lands, this additional blow also befell the\r\nSabines. Fabius Quintus was sent to Algidum as successor to Minucius.\r\nTowards the end of the year the tribunes began to agitate the question\r\nof the law; but because two armies were abroad, the patricians carried\r\nthe point, that no business should be proposed to the people. The\r\ncommons succeeded in electing the same tribunes for the fifth time.\r\nThey report that wolves seen in the Capitol were driven away by dogs;\r\nthat on account of that prodigy the Capitol was purified. Such were the\r\ntransactions in that year.\r\n\r\n30. Quintus Minucius and Caius Horatius Pulvillus follow as the next\r\nconsuls. At the commencement of this year, when there was peace abroad,\r\nthe same tribunes and the same law occasioned disturbances at home; and\r\nparties would have proceeded further, (so highly were their passions\r\ninflamed,) had not, as if for the very purpose, news been brought, that\r\nby an attack of the Æquans the garrison at Corbio had been cut off. The\r\nconsuls convene the senate; they are ordered to raise a hasty levy and\r\nto proceed to Algidum. Then the contest about the law being given up, a\r\nnew dispute arose regarding the levy. And the consular authority[132]\r\nwas about to be overpowered by tribunitian influence, when an additional\r\ncause of alarm comes on them: that the Sabine army had made a descent\r\ninto the Roman lands to commit depredations; that from thence they were\r\nadvancing to the city. This fear influenced the tribunes to allow the\r\nlevy to proceed, not without a stipulation, however, that since they had\r\nbeen foiled for five years, and as that was but little protection to the\r\ncommons, ten tribunes of the people should henceforward be elected.\r\nNecessity wrung this from the patricians; this exception only they made,\r\nthat they should not hereafter re-elect the same tribunes. The election\r\nfor the tribunes was held immediately, lest that measure also, like\r\nothers, might prove a delusion after the war. On the thirty-sixth year\r\nafter the first tribunes, ten were elected, two from each class; and\r\nprovision was made that they should be elected in this manner for the\r\nfuture. The levy being then held, Minucius marched out against the\r\nSabines, and found no enemy. Horatius, after the Æquans, having put the\r\ngarrison at Corbio to the sword, had taken Ortona also, fights a battle\r\nat Algidum; he slays a great number; drives the enemy not only from\r\nAlgidum, but from Corbio and Ortona also. Corbio he razed to the ground\r\nfor their having betrayed the garrison.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 132: _Consulare, imperium tribunicio auxilio_.--The consuls\r\npossessed _imperium_. The tribunes could not be said to possess it.\r\nTheir province was confined to _auxilii latio_, sc. adversus consules.]\r\n\r\n31. Marcus Valerius and Spurius Virginius are next elected consuls.\r\nQuiet prevailed at home and abroad. They laboured under a scarcity of\r\nprovisions on account of the excessive rains. A law was proposed\r\nregarding the making Mount Aventine public property. The same tribunes\r\nof the people being re-elected on the following year, Titus Romilius and\r\nCaius Veturius being consuls, strongly recommended the law[133] in all\r\ntheir harangues, \"That they were ashamed of their number increased to no\r\npurpose, if that question should lie for their two years in the same\r\nmanner as it had lain for the whole preceding five.\" Whilst they were\r\nmost busily employed in these matters, an alarming account comes from\r\nTusculum, that the Æquans were in the Tusculan territory. The recent\r\nservices of that state made them ashamed of delaying relief. Both the\r\nconsuls were sent with an army, and find the enemy in their usual post\r\nin Algidum. A battle was fought there; upwards of seven thousand of the\r\nenemy were slain; the rest were routed; immense booty was obtained. This\r\nthe consuls sold on account of the low state of the treasury; the\r\nproceeding was the cause of dissatisfaction to the army, and it also\r\nafforded to the tribunes materials for bringing a charge against the\r\nconsuls before the commons. Accordingly, as soon as they went out of\r\noffice, in the consulship of Spurius Tarpeius and Aulus Aterius, a day\r\nwas appointed for Romilius by Caius Claudius Cicero, tribune of the\r\npeople; for Veturius, by Lucius Alienus, plebeian ædile. They were both\r\ncondemned, to the great mortification of the patricians; Romilius to pay\r\nten thousand _asses_; Veturius, fifteen thousand. Nor did this\r\nmisfortune of their predecessors render the new consuls more remiss.\r\nThey said that they too might be condemned, and that the commons and\r\ntribunes could not carry the law. Then having thrown up the law, which,\r\nin its repeated publication, had now grown old, the tribunes adopted a\r\nmilder mode of proceeding with the patricians. \"That they should at\r\nlength put an end to their disputes. If plebeian laws displeased them,\r\nat least they should suffer legislators (chosen) in common, both from\r\nthe commons and from the patricians, who would propose measures\r\nadvantageous to both parties, and such as might tend to the\r\nequalization of liberty.\" This proposal the patricians did not reject.\r\nThey said that \"no one should propose laws, except some of the\r\npatricians.\" When they agreed with respect to the laws, and differed\r\nonly with respect to the proposer; ambassadors were sent to Athens,\r\nSpurius Posthumius Albus, Aulus Manlius, Publius Sulpicius Camerinus;\r\nand they were ordered to copy out the celebrated laws of Solon, and to\r\nbecome acquainted with the institutions, customs, and laws of the other\r\nstates of Greece.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 133: It is extraordinary that Livy makes no mention here of\r\nSiccius Dentatus, and his strenuous exertions in endeavouring to carry\r\nthe agrarian law, as well as of his angry contentions with the consuls.\r\nFor his character, see Dion. x. 31, 32.]\r\n\r\n32. The year was undisturbed by foreign wars; the following one was\r\nstill more quiet, Publius Curiatius and Sextus Quintilius being consuls,\r\nthe tribunes observing uninterrupted silence, which was occasioned in\r\nthe first place by their waiting for the ambassadors who had gone to\r\nAthens, and for the foreign laws; in the next place, two heavy\r\ncalamities arose at the same time, famine and pestilence, (which proved)\r\ndestructive to man, and equally so to cattle. The lands were left\r\ndesolate; the city exhausted by a constant succession of deaths. Many\r\nand illustrious families were in mourning. The Flamen Quirinalis,\r\nServilius Cornelius, died; as also the augur, Caius Horatius Pulvillus;\r\ninto whose place the augurs elected Caius Veturius, the more eagerly,\r\nbecause he had been condemned by the commons. The consul Quintilius\r\ndied, and four tribunes of the people. The year was rendered a\r\nmelancholy one by these manifold disasters; but from an enemy there was\r\nperfect quiet. Then Caius Menenius and Publius Sestius Capitolinus were\r\nelected consuls. Nor was there in that year any external war:\r\ndisturbances arose at home. The ambassadors had now returned with the\r\nAthenian laws; the tribunes pressed the more urgently, that a\r\ncommencement should at length be made of compiling the laws. It was\r\nresolved that decemvirs should be elected without appeal, and that there\r\nshould be no other magistrate during that year. There was, for a\r\nconsiderable time, a dispute whether plebeians should be admitted among\r\nthem: at length the point was given up to the patricians, provided that\r\nthe Icilian law regarding the Aventine and the other devoting laws were\r\nnot repealed.\r\n\r\n33. In the three hundred and first year after Rome was built, the form\r\nof the government was a second time changed, the supreme power being\r\ntransferred from consuls to decemvirs, as it had passed before from\r\nkings to consuls. The change was less remarkable, because not of long\r\nduration; for the joyous commencement of that government became too\r\nlicentious. So much the sooner did the matter fall, and (the usage) was\r\nrecurred to, that the name and authority of consuls was committed to two\r\npersons. The decemvirs appointed were, Appius Claudius, Titus Genucius,\r\nPublius Sestius, Lucius Veturius, Caius Julius, Aulus Manlius, Servius\r\nSulpicius, Publius Curiatius, Titus Romilius, Spurius Postumius. On\r\nClaudius and Genucius, because they had been elected consuls for that\r\nyear, the honour was conferred in compensation for the honour (of the\r\nconsulate); and on Sestius, one of the consuls of the former year,\r\nbecause he had proposed that matter to the senate against the will of\r\nhis colleague. Next to these were considered the three ambassadors who\r\nhad gone to Athens; at the same time that the honour might serve as a\r\nrecompence for so distant an embassy; at the same time they considered\r\nthat persons acquainted with the foreign laws would be of use in\r\ndigesting the new code of regulations. Other persons made up the number.\r\nThey say that persons advanced in years were appointed by the last\r\nsuffrages, in order that they might oppose with less warmth the opinions\r\nof others. The direction of the entire government was rested in Appius\r\nthrough the favour of the commons, and he had assumed a demeanour so\r\nnew, that from a severe and harsh reviler of the people, he became\r\nsuddenly a protector of the commons, and a candidate for popular favour.\r\nThey administered justice to the people one every tenth day. On that day\r\nthe twelve fasces attended the præfect of justice; one beadle attended\r\neach of his nine colleagues, and in the singular harmony among\r\nthemselves, which unanimity might sometimes prove prejudicial to private\r\npersons, the strictest equity was shown to others. It will suffice to\r\nadduce a proof of their moderation by instancing one matter. Though they\r\nhad been appointed without (the privilege of) appeal, yet a dead body\r\nhaving been found buried in the house of Publius Sestius, a man of\r\npatrician rank, and this having been brought forward in an assembly, in\r\na matter equally clear and atrocious, Caius Julius, a decemvir,\r\nappointed a day of trial for Sestius, and appeared before the people as\r\nprosecutor (in a matter) of which he was legally a judge; and\r\nrelinquished his right, so that he might add what had been taken from\r\nthe power of the office to the liberty of the people.\r\n\r\n34. Whilst the highest and lowest alike experienced from them this\r\nprompt administration of justice, impartial, as if from an oracle, then\r\ntheir attention was devoted to the framing of laws; and the ten tables\r\nbeing proposed amid the intense expectation of all, they summoned the\r\npeople to an assembly: and \"what may prove favourable, advantageous, and\r\nhappy to the commonwealth themselves, and to their children, ordered\r\nthem to go and read the laws that were exhibited.\" \"That they had\r\nequalized the rights of all, both the highest and the lowest, as far as\r\ncould be devised by the abilities of ten men; that the understanding and\r\ncounsels of a greater number might prove more successful; that they\r\nshould turn in their minds each particular within themselves, canvass it\r\nin conversation; and bring together under public discussion whatever\r\nmight seem an excess or deficiency under each particular. That the Roman\r\npeople should have such laws, as the general consent might appear not so\r\nmuch to have ratified when proposed, as to have proposed from\r\nthemselves.\" When they appeared sufficiently corrected according to\r\npublic opinion (as expressed) regarding each chapter of the laws as it\r\nwas published, the laws of the ten tables were passed at the assembly\r\nvoting by centuries; which, even at the present time, amid this immense\r\nheap of laws crowded one upon the other, still remain the source of all\r\npublic and private jurisprudence. A rumour was then spread that two\r\ntables were wanting; on the addition of which a body, as it were, of the\r\nwhole Roman law might be completed. The expectation of this, as the day\r\nof election approached, created a desire to appoint decemvirs again. The\r\ncommons now, besides that they detested the name of consuls as much as\r\nthat of kings, required not even the tribunitian aid, as the decemvirs\r\nin turn submitted to appeal.\r\n\r\n35. But when the assembly for electing decemvirs was proclaimed for the\r\nthird market-day, so strong a flame of ambition blazed forth, that the\r\nfirst men of the state began to canvass individuals, (through fear, I\r\nsuppose, lest the possession of such high authority might become\r\naccessible to persons not sufficiently worthy, if the post were left\r\nunoccupied by themselves,) suppliantly soliciting for an honour, which\r\nhad been opposed by them with all their might, from that commons with\r\nwhom they had so often contended. Their dignity now lowered to the risk\r\nof a contest, at such an age, and after passing through such honours,\r\nstimulated the exertions of Appius Claudius. You would not know whether\r\nto reckon him among the decemvirs or the candidates; he resembled more\r\nclosely one canvassing for the office than one invested with it; he\r\naspersed the nobility, extolled every most insignificant and humble\r\ncandidate; surrounded by the Duilii and Icilii who had been tribunes, he\r\nbustled about the forum, through their means he recommended himself to\r\nthe commons; until his colleagues even, who till then had been extremely\r\ndevoted to him, turned their eyes on him, wondering what he meant. It\r\nwas evident to them, that there was no sincerity in it; \"that certainly\r\nsuch affability amid such pride would not be for nothing. That this\r\nexcessive lowering of himself, and putting himself on a level with\r\nprivate citizens, was not so much the conduct to be expected from one\r\nhastening to go out of office, as of one seeking the means of continuing\r\nthat office.\" Not daring openly to oppose his wishes, they set about\r\nbaffling his ardour by humouring it. They by common consent confer on\r\nhim, as being the youngest, the office of presiding at the elections.\r\nThis was an artifice, that he might not appoint himself; which no one\r\never did, except the tribunes of the people, and that too with the very\r\nworst precedent. He, however, declaring that with the favour of fortune\r\nhe would preside at the elections, seized on the (intended)\r\nobstacle[134] as a happy occasion; and having by a coalition foiled the\r\ntwo Quintii, Capitolinus and Cincinnatus, and his own uncle, Caius\r\nClaudius, a man most stedfast in the interest of the nobility, and other\r\ncitizens of the same eminence, he appoints as decemvirs men by no means\r\nequal in rank of life: himself in the first instance, which proceeding\r\nhonourable men disapproved so much the more, as no one had imagined that\r\nhe would have the daring to act so. With him were elected Marcus\r\nCornelius-Maluginensis, Marcus Sergius, Lucius Minutius, Quintus Fabius\r\nVibulanus, Quintus Pœtelius, Titus Antonius Merenda, Cæso Duilius,\r\nSpurius Oppius Cornicen, Manius Rabuleius.[135]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 134: _Impedimentum_. The fact of his presiding at the meeting\r\nshould have been a bar to his being elected a decemvir.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 135: Niebuhr will have it that five of these were of plebeian\r\nrank.]\r\n\r\n36. This was the end of Appius's assumption of a character not his own.\r\nHenceforward he began to live according to his own natural disposition,\r\nand to mould to his own temper his new colleagues before they should\r\nenter on their office. They held daily meetings remote from witnesses:\r\nthen, furnished with their schemes of tyranny,[136] which they digested\r\napart from others, no longer dissembling their arrogance, difficult of\r\naccess, morose to all who addressed them, they carried out the matter to\r\nthe ides of May. The ides of May were at that time the usual period for\r\ncommencing office. At the commencement then of their magistracy, they\r\nrendered the first day of their office remarkable by making an\r\nexhibition of great terror. For when the preceding decemvirs had\r\nobserved the rule, that only one should have the fasces, and that this\r\nemblem of royalty should pass through all in rotation, to each in his\r\nturn, they all suddenly came forth with the twelve fasces. One hundred\r\nand twenty lictors filled the forum, and carried before them the axes\r\ntied up with the fasces: and they explained that it was of no\r\nconsequence that the axe should be taken away, as they had been\r\nappointed without the privilege of appeal.[137] There was the appearance\r\nof ten kings, and terrors were multiplied not only in the humblest\r\nindividuals, but even in the principal men among the patricians, who\r\nthought that a pretext and commencement of bloodshed were sought for; so\r\nthat if any one should utter a word favourable to liberty, either in the\r\nsenate or in a meeting of the people, the rods and axes would be\r\ninstantly brought forward, even to intimidate the rest. For besides that\r\nthere was no protection in the people, the right of appeal being done\r\naway with, they had also by mutual consent prohibited interference with\r\neach other:[138] whereas the preceding decemvirs had allowed the points\r\nof law decided by themselves to be amended by appeal to a colleague, and\r\nhad referred to the people some points which might seem to come within\r\ntheir own jurisdiction. For a considerable time the terror seemed\r\nequalized among all ranks; gradually it began to turn entirely on the\r\ncommons. They spared the patricians; arbitrary and cruel treatment was\r\nshown to the humbler classes: they were wholly respective of the person,\r\nnot of the cause: as being persons with whom interest usurped the force\r\nof justice. Their decisions they concerted at home, and pronounced in\r\nthe forum. If any person appealed to a colleague, he left the one to\r\nwhom he had appealed in such a manner as to regret that he had not\r\nabided by the sentence of the former. An opinion also had gone abroad\r\nwithout an authority, that they had conspired in their tyranny not only\r\nfor the present time, but that a clandestine league had been struck\r\namong them (accompanied) with an oath, that they would not hold the\r\ncomitia, and that by perpetuating the decemvirate they would retain the\r\npower now in their possession.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 136: _Impotentibus_, sc. immoderatis--_rari aditus_, the\r\ngenitive singular.--_Stroth._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 137: _Nec attinuisse demi securim, quum sine provocatione\r\ncreati essent, interpretabantur_. Valerius Publicola had introduced the\r\ncustom of not having the axes tied up with the fasces when carried\r\nbefore the consuls in the city. But the decemvirs said that this was,\r\nbecause an appeal from the consuls to the people was allowed. Whence,\r\nsince their jurisdiction allowed of no appeal, they _interpreted_, i. e.\r\nby interpreting the meaning or intention of this custom, they concluded\r\nthat they were not bound by it, and that there was no reason why they\r\nshould remove the axes from the fasces.--_Crev._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 138: _Provocatione_--intercessionem. The _provocatio_ was to\r\nthe people, whilst the _intercessio_ referred to the decemvirs against a\r\ncolleague.]\r\n\r\n37. The plebeians then began to watch narrowly the countenances of the\r\npatricians, and (hoped) to catch the breeze of liberty from that\r\nquarter, by apprehending slavery from which, they had brought the\r\nrepublic into its present condition. The leading members of the senate\r\ndetested the decemvirs, detested the commons; they neither approved of\r\nwhat was going on, and they considered that what befell the latter was\r\nnot without their deserving it. They were unwilling to assist men who,\r\nby rushing too eagerly towards liberty, had fallen into slavery: they\r\neven heaped injuries on them, that, from their disgust at the present\r\nstate of things, two consuls and the former mode of government may at\r\nlength become desirable. The greater part of the year was now passed,\r\nand two tables of laws had been added to the ten tables of the former\r\nyear; and if these laws also were once passed in an assembly of the\r\ncenturies, there now remained no reason why the republic should require\r\nthat form of government. They were anxiously waiting to see how soon\r\nthe assembly would be proclaimed for the election of consuls. The\r\ncommons were only devising by what means they should re-establish the\r\ntribunitian power, that bulwark of their liberty, a thing now so long\r\ndiscontinued. When in the mean time no mention was made of the\r\nelections, and the decemvirs, who had at first exhibited themselves to\r\nthe people, surrounded by men of tribunitian rank, because that was\r\ndeemed popular, now guarded themselves by collecting young patricians;\r\ntroops of these beset the tribunals. These seized and drove about the\r\ncommons, and the effects of the commons; when success attended the more\r\npowerful individual, as far as obtaining any thing he might covet.[139]\r\nAnd now they spared not even their backs. Some were beaten with rods;\r\nothers had to submit to the axe; and lest such cruelty might go for\r\nnothing, a grant of his effects followed the punishment of the owner.\r\nCorrupted by such bribes, the young nobility not only made no opposition\r\nto oppression, but openly avowed their preference of their own\r\ngratification to the general liberty.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 139: _Quum fortuna, qua quicquid cupitum foret, potentioris\r\nesset_. Stroth considers this passage to be corrupt: he proposes to read\r\n_cum fortuna_, so that _portentioris esset_ may refer to _quicquid\r\ncupitum foret_, i. e. with such favourable success, that every thing\r\nwhich the more powerful person might covet, became his.]\r\n\r\n38. The ides of May came. No new election of magistrates having taken\r\nplace, private persons came forth as decemvirs, without any abatement\r\neither in their determination to enforce their authority,[140] or any\r\ndiminution in the emblems employed to make a parade of their station.\r\nThis indeed seemed to be regal tyranny. Liberty is now deplored as lost\r\nfor ever; nor does any champion stand forth, or appear likely to do so.\r\nAnd not only they themselves sunk into despondence, but they began to be\r\nlooked down upon by the neighbouring states; and they felt indignant\r\nthat dominion should exist where liberty was lost. The Sabines with a\r\nnumerous body of men made an incursion on the Roman territory; and\r\nhaving committed extensive devastations, after they had driven with\r\nimpunity booty of men and cattle, they recalled their troops which had\r\nbeen dispersed in different directions to Eretum, and pitch their camp\r\nthere, grounding their hopes on the dissensions at Rome; (and trusting)\r\nthat they would prove an obstruction to the levy. Not only the couriers,\r\nbut the flight of the country people through the city, occasioned alarm.\r\nThe decemvirs consult what should be done. Whilst they were thus left\r\ndestitute between the hatred of the patricians and people, fortune\r\nadded, moreover, another cause of alarm. The Æquans on the opposite side\r\npitch their camp at Algidum; and ambassadors from Tusculum, imploring\r\nrelief, bring accounts that the Tusculan land was ravaged by detachments\r\nfrom thence. The panic occasioned hereby urged the decemvirs to consult\r\nthe senate, two wars at the same time surrounding the city. They order\r\nthe patricians to be summoned into the senate-house, well aware what a\r\nstorm of resentment was ready to break upon them; that all would heap on\r\nthem the causes of the land laid waste, and of the dangers which\r\nthreatened them; and that that would occasion an attempt to abolish\r\ntheir office, if they did not unite in resisting, and by enforcing their\r\nauthority with severity on a few of an intractable spirit repress the\r\nefforts of others. When the voice was heard in the forum of the crier\r\nsummoning the senators into the senate-house before the decemvirs; as a\r\nmatter altogether new, because they had long since laid aside the custom\r\nof consulting the senate, it attracted the attention of the people, who\r\nexpressed their surprise: \"What could have happened, that after so long\r\nan interval they should revive a practice now discontinued. That they\r\nhad reason to return thanks to the enemy and to war, that any thing was\r\ndone that used to be done when their state was free.\" They looked around\r\nfor a senator through all parts of the forum, and seldom recognised one\r\nany where: they then directed their attention to the senate-house, and\r\nto the solitude around the decemvirs: whilst both they themselves\r\nreferred the non-assembling of the patricians to their own universally\r\ndetested government, and the commons (would have it, that the cause of\r\nthe non-assembling was) because, being but private citizens, they (the\r\ndecemvirs) had no right to convene the senate;[141] \"that a head was\r\nnow formed of those who would demand back their liberty, if the commons\r\nwould but accompany the senate, and as the patricians, when summoned,\r\ndid not attend the senate, so the commons also should refuse to enlist.\"\r\nSuch were the remarks of the commons. There was scarcely any of the\r\npatricians in the forum, and but very few in the city. In disgust with\r\nthe state of affairs, they had retired into the country, and were\r\nattending to their own affairs, renouncing all public concerns,\r\nconsidering that they themselves were aloof from ill-treatment in\r\nproportion as they should remove themselves from the meeting and\r\nconverse of their imperious masters. When those who had been summoned\r\ndid not assemble, apparitors were despatched to their houses, both to\r\nlevy the penalties,[142] and to ascertain whether they declined\r\nattendance through design? They bring back word that the senate was in\r\nthe country. This was more pleasing to the decemvirs, than if they\r\nbrought word that they were present and refused obedience to their\r\ncommands. They command them all to be sent for, and proclaim a meeting\r\nof the senate for the following day; which congregated together in much\r\ngreater numbers than they themselves had expected. By which proceeding\r\nthe commons considered that their liberty was betrayed by the\r\npatricians, because the senate had obeyed those persons, as if they had\r\na right to compel them, who had already gone out of office; and were but\r\nprivate individuals, were it not for the violence employed by them.[143]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 140: _Inhibendum_, sc. _adhibendum_--the term _inhibeo_ occurs\r\nfrequently in this sense, as below, _imperioque inhibendo_. The\r\nadjective _imminutis_ also refers evidently to _honoris\r\ninsignibus_.--_Stroth._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 141: The words are, _quum et ipsi invisum consensu imperium,\r\net plebs, quid privatis jus non esset vocandi senatum, non convenire\r\npatres interpretarentur_, i. e. while, on the one hand, the decemvirs\r\nthemselves accounted for the staying away of the senators from the\r\nmeeting, by the fact of their (the decemvirs') government being disliked\r\nby them; whilst, on the other hand, the commons accounted for the\r\nnon-appearance of the senators by the fact, that being now mere private\r\ncitizens, their time of office being passed, they (the decemvirs) had no\r\nright whatever to convene the senate.--_Stroth._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 142: The senators were obliged to attend the meeting of the\r\nsenate when convened by the magistrate; otherwise a fine was imposed, to\r\ninsure the payment of which pledges were exacted, which were sold in\r\ncase of non-payment. See Cicero de Orat. iii. 1. Philip. i. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 143: In the original the words are: _quod iis qui jam\r\nmagistratu abissent, privatisque, si vis abesset_, &c., i. e. who\r\ndiffered in no other respect from mere private citizens, except that\r\nthey had recourse to violence, which it was competent for the magistrate\r\nonly to do.]\r\n\r\n39. But they showed more obedience in coming into the senate than\r\nservility in the sentiments expressed by them, as we have learned. It\r\nis recorded that, after Appius's stating the subject of the meeting, and\r\nbefore the opinions were demanded in order, Lucius Valerius Potitus\r\nexcited a commotion, by demanding permission to express his sentiments\r\nconcerning the state, and when the decemvirs were prohibiting him with\r\nthreats, declaring that he would present himself before the people. (We\r\nhave also heard) that Marcus Horatius Barbatus entered the lists with no\r\nless boldness, calling them \"ten Tarquins,\" and reminding them, \"that\r\nunder the leadership of the Valerii and Horatii[144] the kings had been\r\nexpelled. Nor was it of the mere name that men were then tired, it being\r\nthat by which it was usual to style Jupiter, and by which Romulus, the\r\nfounder of the city, and his successors were also styled; a name too\r\nwhich has been retained even in the ceremonies of religion, as a solemn\r\none; that it was the tyranny and arrogance of a king they then detested,\r\nwhich if they were not to be tolerated in one who was both a king\r\nhimself and the son of a king, who was to tolerate it in so many private\r\ncitizens? that they should beware lest, by preventing persons from\r\nspeaking their sentiments freely in the senate, they might oblige them\r\nto raise their voice outside the senate-house. Nor could he see how it\r\nwas less allowable for him, a private citizen, to summon the people to\r\nan assembly, than for them to convene the senate. They might try,\r\nwhenever they pleased, how much more determined a sense of wrong will be\r\nfound to be in vindicating one's own liberty, than ambition in\r\n(vindicating) usurped domination. That they proposed the question\r\nconcerning the Sabine war, as if the Roman people had any more important\r\nwar on hand, than that against those who, having been elected for the\r\npurpose of framing laws, had left no law in the state; who had abolished\r\nelections, annual magistrates, the regular change of rulers, which was\r\nthe only means of equalizing liberty; who, though private citizens,\r\nstill possess the fasces and regal dominion. That on the expulsion of\r\nthe kings, patrician magistrates were appointed, and subsequently,\r\nafter the secession of the people, plebeian magistrates. To which party,\r\nhe asked, did they belong? To the popular party? What had they ever done\r\nwith the concurrence of the people? were they nobles? who for now nearly\r\nan entire year have not held a meeting of the senate; and then hold one\r\nin such a manner, that they actually prevent numbers from expressing\r\ntheir sentiments regarding the commonwealth; that they should not place\r\ntoo much hope in the fears of others; that the grievances which they are\r\nsuffering now appear to men more oppressive than any they may have to\r\napprehend.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 144: Livy's own account of the matter does not justify this\r\nclaim of the Horatii to having been at the head of the revolution which\r\nbanished the kings. But Dionysius of Halicarnassus informs us that it\r\nwas Marcus Horatius who made the army revolt against Tarquinius\r\nSuperbus, and that the same in his second consulate rendered unavailing\r\nall the efforts of Porsenna to restore the Tarquins.]\r\n\r\n40. Whilst Horatius was exclaiming in this manner, \"and the decemvirs\r\ncould not discover any limit either to their anger or forbearance, nor\r\ncould they see to what the thing would come, Caius Claudius, who was\r\nuncle to Appius the decemvir, delivered an address more like entreaties\r\nthan reproach, beseeching him by the shade of his own brother and of his\r\nfather, that he would hold in recollection the civil society in which he\r\nhad been born rather than the confederacy nefariously entered into with\r\nhis colleagues; that he besought this much more on Appius's own account,\r\nthan for the sake of the commonwealth. For that the commonwealth would\r\nassert its rights in spite of them, if it could not obtain them with\r\ntheir consent. But that from great contests great animosities arise; the\r\nresult of the latter he dreads.\" Though the decemvirs forbad them to\r\nspeak on any other subject than that which they had submitted to them,\r\nthey felt too much respect for Claudius to interrupt him. He therefore\r\nconcluded his address by moving that it was their wish that no decree of\r\nthe senate should be passed. And all understood the matter thus, that\r\nthey were judged by Claudius to be private citizens; and many of the men\r\nof consular standing expressed their assent. Another measure proposed,\r\nmore harsh in appearance, possessed much less efficacy; one which\r\nordered the patricians to assemble to elect an interrex; for by passing\r\nany resolution they judged, that those persons who convened the senate\r\nwere magistrates of some kind or other, whilst the person who\r\nrecommended that no decree of the senate should be passed, had thereby\r\ndeclared them private citizens. When the cause of the decemvirs was now\r\nsinking, Lucius Cornelius Maluginensis, brother of Marcus Cornelius the\r\ndecemvir, having been purposely reserved from among the consular men to\r\nclose the debate, by affecting an anxiety about the war, defended his\r\nbrother and his colleagues thus: saying, \"he wondered by what fatality\r\nit had occurred, that those who had been candidates for the decemvirate,\r\nshould attack the decemvirs, either as secondaries,[145] or as\r\nprincipals: or when no one disputed for so many months whilst the state\r\nwas disengaged, whether legal magistrates had the management of affairs,\r\nwhy do they now sow discord, when the enemies are nearly at the gate;\r\nunless that in a state of confusion they think that what they are aiming\r\nat will be less seen through.\" But that it was not just that any one\r\nshould prejudice so important a cause, whilst our minds are occupied\r\nwith a more momentous concern. It was his opinion, that the point which\r\nValerius and Horatius urged, viz. that the decemvirs had gone out of\r\noffice before the ides of May, should be discussed in the senate, when\r\nthe wars which are now impending are over, and the commonwealth has been\r\nrestored to tranquillity: and that Appius Claudius should now prepare to\r\ntake notice that an account is to be rendered by him of the comitia\r\nwhich he himself held for electing decemvirs, whether they were elected\r\nfor one year, or until the laws which were wanting were ratified. It was\r\nhis opinion that all other matters should be laid aside for the present,\r\nexcept the war; and if they thought that the reports regarding it were\r\npropagated without foundation, and that not only the couriers, but the\r\nambassadors of the Tusculans also had stated what was false, he thought\r\nthat scouts should be despatched to bring back more certain information;\r\nbut if credit were given both to the couriers and the ambassadors, that\r\nthe levy should be held at the very earliest opportunity; that the\r\ndecemvirs should lead the armies, whither it may seem proper to each;\r\nand that no other matter should take precedence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 145: The original here is rather obscure. _Aut socii, aut hi\r\nmaxime._ Crevier prefers to read _aut soli aut hi maxime_. Stroth\r\nexplains _socii, se socios præbendo_.]\r\n\r\n41. The junior patricians succeeded in having this opinion carried.\r\nValerius and Horatius rising again with greater vehemence demanded\r\naloud, \"that it should be allowed them to express their sentiments\r\nconcerning the republic; that they would address the people, if by a\r\nfaction they were not allowed to do so in the senate. For that private\r\nindividuals, either in the senate or in a general assembly, could not\r\nprevent them; nor would they yield to their imaginary fasces.\" Appius\r\nthen considering that the crisis was now nigh at hand, when their\r\nauthority would be overpowered, unless their violence were resisted with\r\nequal boldness: \"It will be better,\" says he, \"not to utter a word on\r\nany subject, except that which we are now considering: and to Valerius,\r\nwhen he refused to be silent for a private individual, he commands a\r\nlictor to proceed.\" When Valerius, on the threshold of the senate-house,\r\nnow craved the protection of the citizens, Lucius Cornelius, embracing\r\nAppius, put an end to the dispute, not consulting the interest of him\r\nwhose interest he affected to consult; and permission to speak his\r\nsentiments being obtained for Valerius through Cornelius, when this\r\nliberty did not extend beyond words, the decemvirs obtained their\r\nobject. The consulars also and senior members, from the hatred of\r\ntribunitian power still rankling in their bosoms, the desire of which\r\nthey considered was much more keenly felt by the commons than that of\r\nthe consular power, almost had rather that the decemvirs themselves\r\nshould voluntarily resign their office at some future period, than that\r\nthe people should rise once more into consequence through their\r\nunpopularity. If the matter, conducted with gentleness, should again\r\nreturn to the consuls without popular turbulence, that the commons might\r\nbe induced to forget their tribunes, either by the intervention of wars\r\nor by the moderation of the consuls in exercising their authority. A\r\nlevy is proclaimed amid the silence of the patricians; the young men\r\nanswer to their names, as the government was without appeal. The legions\r\nbeing enrolled, the decemvirs set about arranging among themselves who\r\nshould set out to the war, who command the armies. The leading men among\r\nthe decemvirs were, Quintus Fabius and Appius Claudius. There appeared a\r\nmore serious war at home than abroad. They considered the violence of\r\nAppius as better suited to suppress commotions in the city; that Fabius\r\npossessed a disposition rather inconstant in good pursuits than\r\nstrenuous in bad ones. For this man, formerly distinguished at home and\r\nabroad, his office of decemvir and his colleagues had so changed, that\r\nhe chose rather to be like to Appius than like himself. To him the war\r\nagainst the Sabines was committed, his colleagues, Manius Rabuleius and\r\nQuintus Pætelius, being sent with him. Marcus Cornelius was sent to\r\nAlgidum with Lucius Menucius and Titus Antonius, and Cæso Duilius and\r\nMarcus Sergius: they determine on Spurius Oppius as an assistant to\r\nAppius Claudius to protect the city, their authority being equal to that\r\nof all the decemvirs.\r\n\r\n42. The republic was managed with no better success in war than at home.\r\nIn this the only fault in the generals was, that they had rendered\r\nthemselves objects of hatred to their fellow citizens: in other respects\r\nthe whole fault lay with the soldiers; who, lest any enterprise should\r\nsucceed under the conduct and auspices of the decemvirs, suffered\r\nthemselves to be beaten, to their own disgrace, and that of them (the\r\ngenerals). Their armies were routed by the Sabines at Eretum, and in\r\nAlgidum by the Æquans. Having fled from Eretum during the silence of the\r\nnight, they fortified their camp nearer to the city, on an elevated\r\nsituation between Fidenæ and Crustumeria; no where encountering the\r\nenemy, who pursued them, on equal ground, they protected themselves by\r\nthe nature of the place and a rampart, not by valour or arms. Greater\r\ndisgrace and greater loss were sustained in Algidum, their camp also was\r\nlost; and the soldiers, stripped of all their utensils, betook\r\nthemselves to Tusculum, determined to procure the means of subsistence\r\nfrom the good faith and compassion of their hosts; which, however, did\r\nnot disappoint them. Such alarming accounts were brought to Rome, that\r\nthe patricians, having laid aside their hatred of the decemvirs, passed\r\nan order that watches should be held in the city; commanded that all who\r\nwere able by reason of their age to carry arms, should mount guard on\r\nthe walls, and form out-posts before the gates; they also voted arms to\r\nbe sent to Tusculum, besides a reinforcement; that the decemvirs also\r\nshould come down from the citadel of Tusculum and keep their troops\r\nencamped; that the other camp should be removed from Fidenæ into the\r\nSabine territory; and that the enemy might be deterred, by thus\r\nattacking them first, from entertaining any intentions of attacking the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n43. To the calamities received from the enemy, the decemvirs add two\r\nflagitious deeds, one abroad, and the other in the city. In the Sabine\r\ndistrict, Lucius Siccius, who, during the unpopularity of the\r\ndecemvirs, introduced, in secret conversation with the common soldiers,\r\nmention of electing tribunes and of a secession, was sent forwards to\r\nselect a place for a camp: instructions were given to the soldiers whom\r\nthey had sent to accompany him in that expedition, to attack him in a\r\nconvenient place and slay him. They did not kill him with impunity; for\r\nseveral of the assassins fell around him resisting them, whilst,\r\npossessing great personal strength and with a courage equal to that\r\nstrength, he was defending himself against them, now surrounded as he\r\nwas. The rest bring an account into the camp that Siccius, when fighting\r\nbravely, had fallen into an ambush, and that some soldiers were lost\r\nwith him. At first the narrators were believed; afterwards a cohort,\r\nwhich went by permission of the decemvirs to bury those who had fallen,\r\nwhen they observed that none of the bodies there were stripped, that\r\nSiccius lay in the middle with his arms, all the bodies being turned\r\ntowards him, whilst there was neither any body of the enemy, nor even\r\nany traces of them as going away; they brought back his body, saying,\r\nthat he had certainly been slain by his own men. The camp was now filled\r\nwith indignation, and it was being determined that Siccius should be\r\nforthwith brought to Rome, had not the decemvirs hastened to perform a\r\nmilitary funeral for him at the public expense. He was buried amid the\r\ngreat grief of the soldiery, and with the worst possible reputation of\r\nthe decemvirs among the common people.\r\n\r\n44. Another atrocious deed follows in the city, originating in lust,\r\nattended with results not less tragical than that deed which drove the\r\nTarquins from the city and the throne through the injured chastity and\r\nviolent death of Lucretia: so that the decemvirs not only had the same\r\nend as the kings had, but the same cause also of losing their power.\r\nAppius Claudius was seized with a criminal passion for violating the\r\nperson of a young woman of plebeian condition. Lucius Virginius, the\r\ngirl's father, held an honourable rank among the centurions at Algidum,\r\na man of exemplary good conduct both at home and in the service. His\r\nwife had been educated in a similar manner, as also were their children.\r\nHe had betrothed his daughter to Lucius Icilius, who had been a tribune,\r\na man of spirit and of approved zeal in the interest of the people. This\r\nyoung woman, in the bloom of youth, distinguished for beauty, Appius,\r\nburning with desire, attempted to seduce by bribes and promises; and\r\nwhen he perceived that all the avenues (to the possession of her) were\r\nbarred by modesty, he turned his thoughts to cruel and tyrannical\r\nviolence. He instructed a dependent of his, Marcus Claudius, to claim\r\nthe girl as his slave, and not to yield to those who might demand her\r\ninterim retention of liberty; considering that, because the girl's\r\nfather was absent, there was an opportunity for committing the injury.\r\nThe tool of the decemvir's lust laid hands on the girl as she was coming\r\ninto the forum (for there in the sheds the literary schools were held);\r\ncalling her \"the daughter of his slave and a slave herself,\" he\r\ncommanded her to follow him; that he would force her away if she\r\ndemurred. The girl being stupified with terror, a crowd collects at the\r\ncries of the girl's nurse, who besought the protection of the citizens.\r\nThe popular names of her father, Virginius, and of her spouse, Icilius,\r\nare in the mouths of every one. Their regard for them gains over their\r\nacquaintances, whilst the heinousness of the proceeding gains over the\r\ncrowd. She was now safe from violence, when the claimant says, \"that\r\nthere was no occasion for raising a mob; that he was proceeding by law,\r\nnot by force.\" He cites the girl into court. Those who stood by her\r\nadvising her to follow him, they now reached the tribunal of Appius. The\r\nclaimant rehearses the farce well known to the judge, as being the\r\nauthor of the plot, \"that a girl born in his house, and clandestinely\r\ntransferred from thence to the house of Virginius, had been fathered on\r\nthe latter.\" That he stated a thing ascertained by certain evidence, and\r\nwould prove it to the satisfaction even of Virginius himself, whom the\r\nprincipal portion of that loss would concern. That it was but just that\r\nin the interim the girl should accompany her master. The advocates for\r\nVirginia, after they had urged that Virginius was absent on business of\r\nthe state, that he would be here in two days if word were sent to him,\r\nthat it was unfair that in his absence he should run any risk regarding\r\nhis children, demand that he adjourn the whole matter till the arrival\r\nof the father; that he should allow the claim for her interim liberty\r\naccording to the law passed by himself, and not allow a maiden of ripe\r\nage to encounter the risk of her reputation before that of her liberty.\r\n\r\n45. Appius prefaced his decree by observing that the very law, which\r\nVirginius's friends were putting forward as the ground of their demand,\r\nclearly showed how much he favoured liberty. But that liberty would find\r\nsecure protection in it on this condition, that it varied[146] neither\r\nwith respect to cases or persons.[147] For with respect to those\r\nindividuals who were claimed as free, that point of law was good,\r\nbecause[148] any person may proceed by law (and act for them); with\r\nrespect to her who is in the hands of her father, that there was no\r\nother person (than her father) to whom her master need relinquish his\r\nright of possession. That it was his determination, therefore, that her\r\nfather should be sent for: in the mean time, that the claimant should\r\nsuffer no loss of his right, but that he should carry off the girl with\r\nhim, and promise that she should be produced on the arrival of him who\r\nwas called her father. When many rather murmured against the injustice\r\nof this decision than any one individual ventured to protest against it,\r\nthe girl's uncle, Publius Numitorius, and her betrothed spouse, Icilius,\r\njust come in; and way being made through the crowd, the multitude\r\nthinking that Appius might be most effectually resisted by the\r\nintervention of Icilius, the lictor declares that \"he had decided the\r\nmatter,\" and removes Icilius, when he attempted to raise his voice.\r\nInjustice so atrocious would have fired even a cool temper. \"By the\r\nsword, Appius,\" says he, \"I must be removed hence, that you may carry\r\noff in silence that which you wish to be concealed. This young woman I\r\nam about to marry, determined to have a lawful and chaste wife.\r\nWherefore call together all the lictors even of your colleagues; order\r\nthe rods and axes to be had in readiness; the betrothed wife of Icilius\r\nshall not remain without her father's house. Though you have taken from\r\nus the aid of our tribunes, and the power of appeal to the commons of\r\nRome, the two bulwarks for maintaining our liberty, absolute dominion\r\nhas not therefore been given to you over our wives and children. Vent\r\nyour fury on our backs and necks; let chastity at least be secure. If\r\nviolence be offered to her, I shall implore the protection of the\r\ncitizens here present in behalf of my spouse; Virginius will implore\r\nthat of the soldiers in behalf of his only daughter; we shall all\r\nimplore the protection of gods and men, nor shall you carry that\r\nsentence into effect without our blood. I demand of you, Appius,\r\nconsider again and again to what lengths you are proceeding. Let\r\nVirginius, when he comes, consider what conduct he should pursue with\r\nrespect to his daughter. Let him only be assured of this, that if he\r\nyield to the claims of this man, he will have to seek out another match\r\nfor his daughter. As for my part, in vindicating the liberty of my\r\nspouse, life shall leave me sooner than my honour.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 146: Appius here contrasts two classes of persons, one\r\nconsisting of individuals, who are in their own power; the other, of\r\nthose who are not _sui juris_, but are under the control either of a\r\nparent, or some other person. If the question arise concerning a person\r\nwho is _sui juris_, whether he is to be consigned to slavery, or to be\r\nrestored to liberty, then \"_id juris esse_,\" sc. that he remain free\r\ntill the decision is made, _because any person_, as being _homo sui\r\njuris_, and consequently he himself, \"may proceed by law;\" but he says,\r\nthat this does not hold good with respect to a person who is not _sui\r\njuris_, but is in the hands of others; such a person, he says, cannot be\r\npronounced free, but must be subject to the power, either of the parent\r\nor master, so that no injury be done to either. Wherefore, since the\r\ngirl is not _sui juris_, she must be in the power, either of Virginius,\r\nwho says he is her father, or of Claudius, who says he is her master.\r\nBut since Virginius is not present, that she can be in the power of no\r\none but Claudius, until Virginius arrive.\r\n\r\nI cannot resist the temptation of giving in full Mr. Gunn's note on the\r\npassage, as found in his very neat edition of our author.\r\n\r\n\"Appius for his own purposes, in interpreting his own law, introduces a\r\ndistinction betwixt those who were _sui juris_, entirely free, and those\r\nwho were subject to the _patria potestas_. The law, according to him,\r\ncan apply only to the former, because in them only is there a true claim\r\nfor liberty, and in them only could a judge give an interim decision\r\n_secundum libertatem_. To give such a decision in favour of Virginia,\r\nwould be a _variatio personarum_; it would be introducing as entitled to\r\nthe benefit of the law a class of persons, who were, even according to\r\ntheir own statements, not entitled to _vindiciæ secundum libertatem_.\r\nBesides, and most important of all, the law could act in the former, as\r\nany citizen was entitled to plead the cause of one presumptively free.\r\nBut in this case no one could plead, but either the father as master on\r\nthe one hand, or the alleged master on the other: as the father was not\r\npresent, consequently no one had any legal claim to urge the law.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 147: _Si nec causis nec personis variet._ Sc. lex variet. Some\r\nunderstand _libertas_ as the nominative to variet.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 148: _Because any person_. \"As the law permits any strangers\r\nto interpose in vindicating an individual's liberty, they have an\r\nundoubted right so to do. But the question is not whether this maiden is\r\nfree: that she cannot be in any case; for she belongs either to her\r\nfather or her master. Now as her father is not present to take charge of\r\nher, no one here but her master can have any title to her.\" Appius\r\nargues that he could not pronounce in favour of her temporary liberty,\r\nwithout prejudice to her father's right and power over her: as there was\r\nno one present, who claimed a legal right to the possession of her but\r\nM. Claudius, the judge had no alternative but to award her during the\r\ninterim to his safe keeping.--_Stocker._]\r\n\r\n46. The multitude was now excited, and a contest seemed likely to ensue.\r\nThe lictors had taken their stand around Icilius; nor did they, however,\r\nproceed beyond threats, when Appius said, \"that it was not Virginia that\r\nwas defended by Icilius, but that, being a restless man, and even now\r\nbreathing the spirit of the tribuneship, he was seeking an occasion for\r\na disturbance. That he would not afford him material on that day; but in\r\norder that he may now know that the concession has been made not to his\r\npetulance, but to the absent Virginius, to the name of father and to\r\nliberty, that he would not decide the cause on that day, nor interpose a\r\ndecree: that he would request of Marcus Claudius to forego somewhat of\r\nhis right, and suffer the girl to be bailed till the next day. But\r\nunless the father attended on the following day, he gave notice to\r\nIcilius and to men like Icilius, that neither the founder would be\r\nwanting to his own law, nor firmness to the decemvir; nor would he\r\nassemble the lictors of his colleagues to put down the promoters of\r\nsedition; that he would be content with his own lictors.\" When the time\r\nof this act of injustice was deferred, and the friends of the maiden had\r\nretired, it was first of all determined, that the brother of Icilius and\r\nthe son of Numitorius, both active young men, should proceed thence\r\nstraightforward to the gate, and that Virginius should be brought from\r\nthe camp with all possible haste. That the safety of the girl depended\r\non his being present next day at the proper time, as her protector from\r\ninjury. They proceed according to directions and with all speed carry\r\nthe account to her father. When the claimant of the maiden was pressing\r\nIcilius to become defendant, and give sureties,[149] and Icilius said\r\nthat that was the very thing he was doing, designedly spinning out the\r\ntime, until the messengers sent to the camp might gain time for their\r\njourney, the multitude raised their hands on all sides, and every one\r\nshowed himself ready to go surety for Icilius. And he with tears in his\r\neyes says, It is very kind of you; on to-morrow I will avail myself of\r\nyour assistance; at present I have sufficient sureties. Thus Virginia is\r\nbailed on the security of her relations. Appius having delayed a short\r\ntime, that he might not appear to have sat on account of the present\r\ncase, when no one applied, all other concerns being given up by reason\r\nof their solicitude about the one, betook himself home, and writes to\r\nhis colleagues to the camp, \"not to grant leave of absence to Virginius,\r\nand even to keep him in confinement.\" This wicked scheme was late, as it\r\ndeserved to be; for Virginius, having already obtained his leave, had\r\nset out at the first watch, while the letter regarding his detention was\r\ndelivered on the following morning to no purpose.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 149: _Sureties_--sponsores. The preliminary bail.]\r\n\r\n47. But in the city, when the citizens were standing in the forum erect\r\nwith expectation, Virginius, clad in mourning, by break of day conducts\r\nhis daughter, also attired in weeds, attended by some matrons, into the\r\nforum, with a considerable body of advocates. He then began to go round\r\nand to solicit individuals; and not only to entreat their aid as a boon\r\nto his prayers, but demanded it as due to him: \"that he stood daily in\r\nthe field of battle in defence of their children and wives, nor was\r\nthere any other man, to whom a greater number of brave and intrepid\r\ndeeds in war can be ascribed than to him. What availed it, if, whilst\r\nthe city was still secure, their children would be exposed to suffer the\r\nseverest hardships which would have to be dreaded if it was taken?\"\r\nDelivering these observations like one haranguing in an assembly, he\r\nsolicited them individually. Similar arguments were used by Icilius: the\r\nfemale attendants produced more effect by their silent tears than any\r\nlanguage. With a mind utterly insensible to all this, (such, a paroxysm\r\nof madness, rather than of love, had perverted his mind,) Appius\r\nascended the tribunal; and when the claimant began to complain briefly,\r\nthat justice had not been administered to him on the preceding day\r\nthrough a desire to please the people, before either he could go through\r\nwith his claim, or an opportunity of reply was afforded to Virginius,\r\nAppius interrupts him. The preamble with which he prefaced the sentence,\r\nancient authors may have handed down perhaps with truth; because I no\r\nwhere find any one that was likely (to have been used) on so scandalous\r\na business, it seems, that the naked fact should be stated as being a\r\npoint which is agreed on, viz. that he passed a sentence[150] consigning\r\nher to slavery. At first all were astounded with amazement at so\r\nheinous a proceeding; then silence prevailed for some time. Then when\r\nMarcus Claudius proceeded to seize the maiden, the matrons standing\r\naround her, and was received with piteous lamentation of the women,\r\nVirginius, menacingly extending his hands towards Appius, says, To\r\nIcilius, and not to you, Appius, have I betrothed my daughter, and for\r\nmatrimony, not prostitution, have I brought her up. Do you wish men to\r\ngratify their lust promiscuously, like cattle and wild beasts? Whether\r\nthese persons will endure such things, I know not; I hope that those\r\nwill not who have arms in their hands. When the claimant of the girl was\r\nrepulsed by the crowd of women and advocates who were standing around\r\nher, silence was commanded by the crier.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 150: _He passed a sentence_, &c. In the original it is,\r\n\"decresse vindicias secundum servitutem.\" This decision relates to the\r\ndefinitive bail. Appius the day before had made up his mind to this\r\ndecision. He had calculated, however, on the non-appearance of the\r\nfather; yet did not now choose to be foiled by his unexpected\r\npresence.--_Stocker._]\r\n\r\n48. The decemvir, engrossed in mind by his lustful propensities, states\r\nthat not only from the abusive language of Icilius yesterday, and the\r\nviolence of Virginius, of which he had the entire Roman people as\r\nwitnesses, but from authentic information also he ascertained, that\r\ncabals were held in the city during the whole night to stir up a\r\nsedition. Accordingly that he, being aware of that danger, had come down\r\nwith armed soldiers; not that he would molest any peaceable person, but\r\nin order to punish suitably to the majesty of the government persons\r\ndisturbing the tranquillity of the state. It will, therefore, be better\r\nto remain quiet. Go, lictor, says he, remove the crowd; and make way for\r\nthe master to lay hold of his slave. When, bursting with passion, he had\r\nthundered out these words, the multitude themselves voluntarily\r\nseparated, and the girl stood deserted a prey to injustice. Then\r\nVirginius, when he saw no aid any where, says, I beg you, Appius, first\r\npardon a father's grief, if I have said any thing too harsh against you:\r\nin the next place, suffer me to question the nurse before the maiden,\r\nwhat all this matter is? that if I have been falsely called her father,\r\nI may depart hence with a more resigned mind. Permission being granted,\r\nhe draws the girl and the nurse aside to the sheds near the temple of\r\nCloacina, which now go by the name of the new sheds: and there snatching\r\nup a knife from a butcher, \"In this one way, the only one in my power,\r\ndo I secure to you your liberty.\" He then transfixes the girl's breast,\r\nand looking back towards the tribunal, he says, \"With this blood I\r\ndevote thee, Appius, and thy head.\" Appius, aroused by the cry raised at\r\nso dreadful a deed, orders Virginius to be seized. He, armed with the\r\nknife, cleared the way whithersoever he went, until, protected by the\r\ncrowd of persons attending him, he reached the gate. Icilius and\r\nNumitorius take up the lifeless body and exhibit it to the people: they\r\ndeplore the villany of Appius, the fatal beauty of the maiden, and the\r\ndire necessity of the father. The matrons who followed exclaim, \"Was\r\nthis the condition of rearing children? were these the rewards of\r\nchastity?\" and other things which female grief on such occasions\r\nsuggests, when their complaints are so much the more affecting, in\r\nproportion as (their grief) is more intense from the natural tenderness\r\nof their minds. The voice of the men, and more especially of Icilius,\r\nentirely turned on the tribunitian power, on the right of appeal to the\r\npeople which had been taken from them, and on the indignities thrown\r\nupon the state.\r\n\r\n49. The multitude was excited partly by the atrocious nature of the\r\ndeed, partly by the hope of recovering their liberty through a\r\nfavourable opportunity. Appius now orders Icilius to be summoned before\r\nhim, now on refusing to come to be seized; at length, when an\r\nopportunity of approaching him was not afforded to the beadles, he\r\nhimself proceeding through the crowd with a body of young patricians,\r\norders him to be taken into confinement. Now not only the multitude, but\r\nLucius Valerius and Marcus Horatius, the leaders of the multitude, stood\r\naround Icilius: who, having repulsed the lictor, stated, that \"if he\r\nmeant to proceed by law, they would protect Icilius from one who was but\r\na private citizen; if he desired to employ force, that they would be no\r\nbad match for him even then.\" Hence arises a furious scuffle. The\r\ndecemvir's lictor attacks Valerius and Horatius: the fasces are broken\r\nby the people. Appius ascends the tribunal; Horatius and Valerius follow\r\nhim. To them the assembly pays attention, they drown with clamour the\r\nvoice of the decemvir. Now Valerius authoritatively ordered the lictors\r\nto depart from one who was but a private citizen: when Appius, whose\r\nspirits were now broken, being alarmed for his life, betook himself into\r\na house in the vicinity of the forum, unknown to his enemies, with his\r\nhead covered up. Spurius Oppius, in order to assist his colleague,\r\nrushes into the forum from the opposite side; he sees their authority\r\noverpowered by force. Distracted then by various counsels between which\r\nhe wavered, by assenting to several advisers from every side, he\r\neventually ordered the senate to be convened. Because the proceedings of\r\nthe decemvirs seemed to be displeasing to the greater portion of the\r\npatricians, this step quieted the people with the hope that the\r\ngovernment would be abolished through the senate. The senate gave their\r\nopinion that neither the commons should be exasperated, and much more\r\nthat care should be taken that the arrival of Virginius should not\r\noccasion any commotion in the army.\r\n\r\n50. Accordingly some of the junior patricians, being sent to the camp\r\nwhich was at that time on Mount Vecilius, announce to the decemvirs\r\n\"that by every means in their power they should keep the soldiers from\r\nmutinying.\" Where Virginius occasioned greater commotion than he had\r\nleft behind him in the city. For besides that he was seen coming with a\r\nbody of near four hundred men, who, fired at the heinous enormity of the\r\noccurrence, had accompanied him from the city; the unsheathed weapon and\r\nhimself besmeared with blood, attracted to him the entire camp; and the\r\ngowns[151] seen in the different parts of the camp, had caused the\r\nnumber of people from the city to appear much greater than it really\r\nwas. When they asked him what was the matter, in consequence of his\r\nweeping he uttered not a word. At length, as soon as the crowd of those\r\nrunning together became still, and silence took place, he related every\r\nthing in order as it occurred. Then extending his hands towards heaven,\r\naddressing his fellow soldiers, he begged of them, \"not to impute to him\r\nthat which was the crime of Appius, not to abhor him as the murderer of\r\nhis children.\" To him the life of his daughter was dearer than his own,\r\nif she had been allowed to live in freedom and chastity. When he beheld\r\nher dragged to prostitution as if a slave, thinking it better that his\r\nchild should be lost by death than by dishonour, through compassion for\r\nher he fell into an appearance of cruelty. Nor would he have survived\r\nhis daughter, had he not placed hope of avenging her death in the aid of\r\nhis fellow soldiers. For that they too had daughters, sisters, and\r\nwives; nor was the lust of Appius Claudius extinguished with his\r\ndaughter; but in proportion as it escaped with impunity, so much the\r\nmore unbridled would it be. That in the calamities of others a warning\r\nwas given to them to guard against a similar injury. That for his own\r\npart, his wife had been taken from him by fate; his daughter, because\r\nshe no longer could live in chastity, died an unfortunate but honourable\r\ndeath; that there was no longer in his house an opportunity for Appius's\r\nlust; that from any other violence of his he would defend his person\r\nwith the same spirit with which he vindicated that of his daughter. That\r\nothers should take care of themselves and of their children. To\r\nVirginius, uttering these words in a loud voice, the multitude responded\r\nwith a shout, \"that they would not be backward, with respect either to\r\nhis wrongs or their own liberty. And the gown-men mixing with the crowd\r\nof soldiers, both by narrating with sorrow those same circumstances, and\r\nby showing how much more shocking they must have appeared when seen than\r\nwhen merely heard, and also by telling them that matters were now\r\ndesperate at Rome; those also who followed (the persons that accompanied\r\nVirginius from Rome) and alleged that Appius, having with difficulty\r\nescaped with life, had gone into exile;[152] all these individuals so\r\nfar influenced them that there was a general cry to arms, they snatched\r\nup their standards, and set out for Rome.\" The decemvirs, being alarmed\r\nat the same time both by what they now saw, as well as by those things\r\nwhich they had heard had taken place at Rome, ran about to different\r\nparts of the camp to quell the commotion. Whilst they proceeded with\r\nmildness no answer was returned to them. If any of them attempted to\r\nexert authority over them, the answer given was, that \"they were men and\r\nhad arms.\" They go in a body to the city and post themselves on the\r\nAventine; encouraging the commons, according as each person met them, to\r\nreassume their liberty, and elect tribunes of the people; no other\r\nviolent expression was heard. Spurius Oppius holds a meeting of the\r\nsenate; it is resolved that no harsh proceedings should be adopted, as\r\noccasion for the sedition had been given by themselves. Three men of\r\nconsular rank, Spurius Tarpeius, Caius Julius, Publius Sulpicius, are\r\nsent as ambassadors, to inquire, in the name of the senate, by whose\r\norders they had deserted the camp? or what they intended in posting\r\nthemselves on the Aventine in arms, and in turning away their arms from\r\nthe enemy and taking their own country? They were at no loss for an\r\nanswer; they wanted some one to give the answer, there being as yet no\r\ncertain leader, and individuals not being forward enough to expose\r\nthemselves to the invidious office. The multitude only called out with\r\none voice, that they should send Lucius Valerius and Marcus Horatius to\r\nthem: that to them they would give their answer.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 151: The dress of the citizens.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 152: Two classes of persons are here intended: 1. Those who\r\naccompanied Virginius into the camp. 2. Others who followed them\r\nsubsequently.]\r\n\r\n51. The ambassadors being dismissed, Virginius reminds the soldiers\r\n\"that a little time before they had been embarrassed in a matter of no\r\nvery great difficulty, because the multitude was without a head; and\r\nthat the answer given, though not inexpedient, was the result rather of\r\nan accidental concurrence than of a concerted plan. His opinion was,\r\nthat ten persons be elected, who should preside in the management of\r\ntheir affairs, and, in the style of military dignity, that they should\r\nbe called tribunes of the soldiers.\" When that honour was offered to\r\nhimself in the first instance, he replied, \"Reserve for an occasion more\r\nfavourable to you and to me those your kind opinions of me. My daughter\r\nbeing unavenged, neither allows any honour to be satisfactory to me, nor\r\nin the disturbed state of things is it useful that those should be at\r\nyour head who are most obnoxious to party malice. If there will be any\r\nuse of me, such use will be derived not in a less degree from me in a\r\nprivate station.\" They then elect military tribunes ten in number. Nor\r\nwas the army among the Sabines inactive. There also, at the instance of\r\nIcilius and Numitorius, a secession from the decemvirs took place, the\r\ncommotion of men's minds on recollecting the murder of Siccius being not\r\nless than that, which the recent account of the barbarous attempt made\r\non the maiden to gratify lust had enkindled. When Icilius heard that\r\ntribunes of the soldiers were elected on Mount Aventine, lest the\r\nelection-assembly in the city might follow the precedent of the military\r\nassembly, by electing the same persons tribunes of the commons, being\r\nwell versed in popular intrigues and having an eye to that office, he\r\nalso takes care, before they proceeded to the city, that the same number\r\nbe elected by his own party with an equal power. They entered the city\r\nthrough the Colline gate in military array, and proceeded in a body to\r\nthe Aventine through the middle of the city. There, joined to the other\r\narmy, they commissioned the twenty tribunes of the soldiers to select\r\ntwo out of their number, who should hold the command in chief. They\r\nchoose Marcus Oppius and Sextus Manilius. The patricians, alarmed for\r\nthe general safety, though there was a meeting every day, waste the time\r\nin wrangling more frequently than in deliberation. The murder of\r\nSiccius, the lust of Appius, and the disgraces incurred in war were\r\nurged as charges against the decemvirs. It was resolved that Valerius\r\nand Horatius should proceed to the Aventine. They refused to go on any\r\nother conditions, than that the decemvirs should lay down the badges of\r\nthat office, which had expired the year before. The decemvirs,\r\ncomplaining that they were now being degraded, stated that they would\r\nnot resign their office, until those laws were passed on account of\r\nwhich they had been appointed.\r\n\r\n52. The people being informed through Marcus Duilius, who had been\r\ntribune of the people, that by reason of their continual contentions no\r\nbusiness was transacted, passes from the Aventine to the Sacred mount;\r\nDuilius affirming that serious concern for business would not enter the\r\nminds of the patricians, until they saw the city deserted. That the\r\nSacred mount would remind them of the people's firmness; that they would\r\nthen know, that matters could not be restored to concord without the\r\nrestoration of (the tribunitian) power. Having set out along the\r\nNomentan way, which was then called the Ficulnean, they pitched their\r\ncamp on the Sacred mount, imitating the moderation of their fathers by\r\ncommitting no violence. The commons followed the army, no one whose age\r\nwould permit him declining to go. Their wives and children attended\r\ntheir steps, piteously asking to whom would they leave them, in a city\r\nin which neither chastity nor liberty were respected? When the unusual\r\nsolitude rendered every place in Rome void; when there was in the forum\r\nno one but a few old men; when, the patricians being convened into the\r\nsenate, the forum appeared deserted; more now besides Horatius and\r\nValerius began to exclaim, \"What will ye now wait for, conscript\r\nfathers? If the decemvirs do not put an end to their obstinacy, will ye\r\nsuffer all things to go to wreck and ruin? What power is that,\r\ndecemvirs, which ye embrace and hold so firmly? do you mean to\r\nadminister justice to walls and mere houses? Are you not ashamed that an\r\nalmost greater number of your lictors is to be seen in the forum than of\r\nthe other citizens? What are ye to do, in case the enemy should approach\r\nthe city? What, if the commons should come presently in arms, if we seem\r\nnot to be moved by their secession? do you mean to conclude your power\r\nby the fall of the city? But (the case is this,) either we must not have\r\nthe commons, or they must have their tribunes. We would sooner dispense\r\nwith our patrician magistrates, than they with their plebeian. That\r\npower, when new and untried, they wrested from our fathers; much less\r\nwill they, now that they have tested the sweets of it, endure its loss:\r\nmore especially since we make not a moderate use of our power, so that\r\nthey may not stand in need of (tribunitian) aid.\" When these arguments\r\nwere thrown out from every quarter, the decemvirs, overpowered by the\r\nunited opinions of all, declare that, since such seems to be the\r\nfeeling, they would submit to the authority of the patricians. All they\r\nask is, that they may be protected from popular rage; they give a\r\nwarning, that they should not through shedding their blood habituate the\r\npeople to inflict punishment on the patricians.\r\n\r\n53. Then Valerius and Horatius, having been sent to bring back the\r\npeople on such terms as might seem fit, and to adjust all differences,\r\nare directed to make provision also for the decemvirs from the\r\nresentment and violence of the multitude. They set forward and are\r\nreceived into the camp with great joy by the people, as being their\r\nliberators beyond all doubt, both at the commencement of the disturbance\r\nand at the termination of the matter. In consideration of these things,\r\nthanks were returned to them on their arrival. Icilius speaks in the\r\nname of the people. When the terms came to be considered, the\r\nambassadors inquiring what were the demands of the people, the same\r\nindividual, having already concerted the plan before the arrival of the\r\nambassadors, stated demands of such a nature, that it became evident,\r\nthat more hope was placed in the justice of their case than in arms. For\r\nthey demanded back the tribunitian office and the right of appeal,\r\nwhich, before the appointment of decemvirs, had been the props of the\r\npeople, and that it should not be visited with injury to any one, to\r\nhave instigated the soldiers or the commons to seek back their liberty\r\nby a secession. Concerning the punishment only of the decemvirs was\r\ntheir demand immoderate; for they thought it but just that they should\r\nbe delivered up to them; and they threatened that they would burn them\r\nalive. In answer the ambassadors say, the demands which have been the\r\nresult of deliberation are so reasonable, that they should be\r\nvoluntarily offered to you; for you seek them as safeguards to your\r\nliberty, not as means of licentious power to assail others. Your\r\nresentment we must rather pardon than indulge; seeing that from your\r\nhatred of cruelty ye rush into cruelty, and almost before you are free\r\nyourselves, you wish already to lord it over your enemies. Shall our\r\nstate never enjoy rest from punishments, either of the patricians on the\r\nRoman commons, or of the commons on the patricians? you have occasion\r\nfor a shield rather than for a sword. He is sufficiently and abundantly\r\nhumble, who lives in a state on an equal footing, neither inflicting nor\r\nsuffering injury. Moreover, \"should you feel disposed to render\r\nyourselves formidable, when, having recovered your magistrates and laws,\r\ndecisions on our lives and fortunes shall be in your hands; then you\r\nshall determine according to the merits of each case; now it is\r\nsufficient that your liberty be restored.\"\r\n\r\n54. All permitting them to act just as they think proper, the\r\nambassadors assure them that they would speedily return, having\r\ncompleted every matter. When they went and laid before the patricians\r\nthe message of the commons, the other decemvirs, since, contrary to\r\ntheir own expectation, no mention was made of their punishment, raised\r\nno objection. Appius, being of a truculent disposition and a particular\r\nobject of detestation, measuring the rancour of others towards him by\r\nhis own towards them, says, \"I am aware of the fate which hangs over me.\r\nI see that the contest against us is deferred, until our arms are\r\ndelivered up to our adversaries. Blood must be offered up to popular\r\nrage. Not even do I demur to resign my decemvirate.\" A decree of the\r\nsenate is then passed, \"that the decemvirs should without delay resign\r\ntheir office; that Quintus Furius, chief pontiff, should hold an\r\nelection of plebeian tribunes, and that the secession of the soldiers\r\nand commons should not be visited on any one.\" These decrees being\r\nfinished, the senate being dismissed, the decemvirs come forth into the\r\nassembly, and resign their office, to the great joy of all. News of this\r\nis carried to the commons. All the people remaining in the city escort\r\nthe ambassadors. This crowd was met by another joyous body from the\r\ncamp; they congratulate each other on the restoration of peace and\r\nconcord to the state. The deputies address the assembly: \"Be it\r\nadvantageous, fortunate, and happy for you and the republic, return into\r\nyour country to your household gods, your wives and children; but carry\r\ninto the city the same modesty which you observed here, where, amid the\r\nconsumption of so many matters necessary for so large a number of\r\npersons, no man's field has been injured. Go to the Aventine, whence ye\r\nset out. In that auspicious place, where ye took the first step towards\r\nliberty, ye shall elect tribunes of the people. The chief pontiff will\r\nbe at hand to hold the elections.\" Great was their assent and joy, as\r\nevinced in their approbation of every measure. They then hastily raise\r\ntheir standards, and having set out for Rome, vie in exultation with all\r\nthey met. There, the chief pontiff holding the meeting for the\r\nelections, they elected as their tribunes of the people, first of all A.\r\nVirginius, then Lucius Icilius, and Publius Numitorius the uncle of\r\nVirginia, the advisers of the secession. Then Caius Sicinius, the\r\noffspring of him who is recorded to have been elected first tribune of\r\nthe commons on the Sacred mount; and Marcus Duilius, who had passed\r\nthrough a distinguished tribuneship before the creation of the\r\ndecemvirs, and was never wanting to the commons in their contests with\r\nthe decemvirs. Marcus Titinius, Marcus Pomponius, Caius Apronius,\r\nPublius Villius, and Caius Oppius, were elected more from hope\r\n(entertained of them) than from any services (performed). When he\r\nentered on his tribuneship, Lucius Icilius proposed to the commons, and\r\nthe commons ordered, that the secession from the decemvirs which had\r\ntaken place should not prove detrimental to any individual. Immediately\r\nafter Duilius carried a proposition for electing consuls, with right of\r\nappeal. All these things were transacted in an assembly of the commons\r\nin the Flaminian meadows, which they now call the Flaminian circus.\r\n\r\n55. Then through an interrex Lucius Valerius and Marcus Horatius were\r\nelected consuls, who immediately entered on their office; whose\r\nconsulship was popular without any actual injury to the patricians,\r\nthough not without their displeasure; for whatever provision was made\r\nfor securing the liberty of the commons, that they considered to be a\r\ndiminution made in their own power. First of all, when it was as it were\r\na point in controversy, whether patricians were bound by regulations\r\nenacted in an assembly of the commons, they proposed a law in the\r\nassembly of the centuries, that whatever the commons ordered\r\ncollectively, should bind the entire people; by which law a most\r\nkeen-edged weapon was given to motions introduced by tribunes. Then\r\nanother law made by a consul concerning the right of appeal, a singular\r\nsecurity to liberty, and subverted by the decemviral power, they not\r\nonly restore, but guard it also for the time to come, by enacting a new\r\nlaw, \"that no one should appoint any magistrate without a right of\r\nappeal; if any person should so elect, it would be lawful and right that\r\nhe be put to death; and that such killing should not be deemed a capital\r\noffence.\" And when they had sufficiently secured the commons by the\r\nright of appeal on the one hand, by tribunitian aid on the other, they\r\nrenewed for the tribunes themselves (the privilege) that they should be\r\nheld sacred and inviolable, the memory of which matter had now been\r\nalmost lost, reviving certain ceremonies which had been long disused;\r\nand they rendered them inviolable both by the religious institution, as\r\nwell as by a law, enacting, that \"whoever should offer injury to\r\ntribunes of the people, ædiles, judges, decemvirs, his person should be\r\ndevoted to Jupiter, and his property be sold at the temple of Ceres,\r\nLiber and Libera.\" Commentators deny that any person is by this law\r\nsacrosanct; but that he who may do an injury to any of them, is deemed\r\nto be devoted; therefore that an ædile may be arrested and carried to\r\nprison by superior magistrates, which, though it be not expressly\r\nwarranted by law, for an injury is done to a person to whom it is not\r\nlawful to do an injury according to this law, yet it is a proof that an\r\nædile is not considered as sacred; that the tribunes were sacred and\r\ninviolable by an ancient oath of the commons, when first they created\r\nthat office. There have been persons who supposed that by this same\r\nHoratian law provision was made for the consuls also and the prætors,\r\nbecause they were elected under the same auspices as the consuls; for\r\nthat a consul was called a judge. Which interpretation is refuted,\r\nbecause at this time it was not yet the custom for the consul to be\r\nstyled judge, but the prætor. These were the laws proposed by the\r\nconsuls. It was also regulated by the same consuls, that decrees of the\r\nsenate should be deposited with the ædiles of the commons in the temple\r\nof Ceres; which before that used to be suppressed and altered at the\r\npleasure of the consuls. Marcus Duilius then, tribune of the commons,\r\nproposed to the people, and the people ordered, that \"whoever left the\r\npeople without tribunes, and whoever caused a magistrate to be elected\r\nwithout the right of appeal, should be punished with stripes and\r\nbeheaded.\" All these matters, though against the feelings of the\r\npatricians, passed off without opposition from them, because no severity\r\nwas aimed at any particular individual.\r\n\r\n56. Then both the tribunitian power and the liberty of the commons being\r\nfirmly established, the tribunes now deeming it both safe and seasonable\r\nto attack individuals, single out Virginius as the first prosecutor and\r\nAppius as defendant. When Virginius appointed a day for Appius, and\r\nAppius came down to the forum, accompanied by some young patricians, the\r\nmemory of his most profligate exercise of power was instantly revived in\r\nthe minds of all, as soon as they beheld himself and his satellites.\r\nThen Virginius says, \"Long speeches have been invented for matters of a\r\ndoubtful nature. Accordingly I shall neither waste time in dwelling on\r\nthe guilt of this man before you, from whose cruelty ye have rescued\r\nyourselves by force of arms, nor shall I suffer him to add impudence to\r\nhis other enormous crimes in defending himself. Wherefore, Appius\r\nClaudius, I remit to you the accumulated impious and nefarious deeds you\r\nhave had the effrontery to commit for the last two years; with respect\r\nto one charge only, unless you will appoint a judge, (and prove) that\r\nyou have not, contrary to the laws, sentenced a free person to be a\r\nslave, I order that you be taken into custody.\" Neither in the aid of\r\nthe tribunes, nor in the judgment of the people, could Appius place any\r\nhope: still he both appealed to the tribunes, and, when no one regarded\r\nhim, being seized by the bailiff, he exclaims, \"I appeal.\" The hearing\r\nof this one expression, that safeguard of liberty, uttered from that\r\nmouth by which a free citizen was so recently consigned to slavery,\r\noccasioned general silence. And, whilst they observe to each other,\r\nthat \"at length there are gods, and that they do not disregard human\r\naffairs; and that punishments await tyranny and cruelty, which, though\r\nlate, are still by no means light; that he now appealed, who had\r\nabolished all right of appeal; and that he implored the protection of\r\nthe people, who had trampled down all the rights of the people; and that\r\nhe was dragged off to prison, destitute of the rights of liberty, who\r\nhad doomed a free person to slavery.\" Amid the murmurs of the assembly,\r\nthe voice of Appius was heard imploring the protection of the Roman\r\npeople. He enumerated the services of his ancestors to the state, at\r\nhome and abroad; his own unfortunate zeal towards the Roman commons;\r\nthat he had resigned the consulship, to the great displeasure of the\r\npatricians, for the purpose of equalizing the laws; (he then mentioned)\r\nhis laws; which, though they still remained in force, the framer of them\r\nwas dragged to a prison. But the peculiar advantages and disadvantages\r\nof his case he would then make trial of, when an opportunity would be\r\nafforded him of stating his defence. At present, he, a Roman citizen,\r\ndemanded, by the common right of citizenship, that he be allowed to\r\nspeak on the day appointed, and to appeal to the judgment of the Roman\r\npeople. That he did not dread popular rage so much as not to place any\r\nhope in the equity and compassion of his fellow citizens. But if he were\r\nled to prison without being heard, that he once more appealed to the\r\ntribunes of the people, and warned them not to imitate those whom they\r\nhated. But if the tribunes acknowledge themselves bound in the same\r\nconfederacy for abolishing the right of appeal, which they charged the\r\ndecemvirs with having formed, then he appealed to the people: he\r\nimplored the benefit of the laws passed that very year, both by the\r\nconsuls and tribunes, regarding the right of appeal. For who would\r\nappeal, if this were not allowed a person as yet uncondemned, whose case\r\nhas not been heard? what plebeian and humble individual would find\r\nprotection in the laws, if Appius Claudius could not? that he would\r\nafford a proof, whether tyranny or liberty was established by the new\r\nlaws; and whether the right of appeal and of challenge against the\r\ninjustice of magistrates was only held out in empty words, or\r\neffectually granted.\r\n\r\n57. Virginius, on the other hand, affirmed that Appius Claudius was the\r\nonly person not entitled to a participation in the laws, nor in civil or\r\nhuman society. That men should look to the tribunal, the fortress of all\r\nvillanies; where that perpetual decemvir, venting his fury on the\r\nproperties, backs, and blood of the citizens, threatening all with his\r\nrods and axes, a despiser of gods and men, attended with executioners,\r\nnot lictors, changing his mind from rapine and murder to lust, before\r\nthe eyes of the Roman people, tore a free-born maiden, as if a prisoner\r\nof war, from the embraces of her father, and gave her as a present to a\r\ndependant, the pander to his secret pleasures. Where by a cruel decree,\r\nand by a most villainous decision, he armed the right hand of the father\r\nagainst the daughter: where he ordered the spouse and uncle, on their\r\nraising the lifeless body of the girl, to be taken off to a prison;\r\nmoved more at the interruption to his sensual gratification than at her\r\nuntimely death. That the prison was built for him also, which he used to\r\ncall the domicile of the Roman commons. Wherefore, though he may appeal\r\nagain and oftener, he would as frequently refer him to a judge, on the\r\ncharge of having sentenced a free person to slavery; if he would not go\r\nbefore a judge, that he ordered him to be taken to prison as one\r\ncondemned. He was thrown into prison, and though without the\r\ndisapprobation of any individual, yet not without considerable emotions\r\nof the public mind, when, in consequence of the punishment of so\r\ndistinguished a man, their own liberty began to appear to the commons\r\nthemselves as excessive. The tribune deferred the day of trial. Whilst\r\nthese matters are going on, ambassadors from the Hernicians and Latins\r\ncame to Rome to present their congratulations on the harmony subsisting\r\nbetween the patricians and commons; and as an offering on that account\r\nto Jupiter, the best and greatest, they brought into the Capitol a\r\ngolden crown, of small weight, as riches at that time did not abound,\r\nand the duties of religion were performed rather with piety than\r\nmagnificence. From the same source it was ascertained that the Æquans\r\nand Volscians were preparing for war with the utmost energy. The consuls\r\nwere therefore ordered to divide the provinces between them. The Sabines\r\nfell to the lot of Horatius, the Æquans and Volscians to that of\r\nValerius. On their proclaiming a levy for these wars, through the good\r\nwishes of the commons, not only the younger men, but of those who had\r\nserved out their time, a considerable portion as volunteers, attended to\r\ngive in their names: and hence the army was stronger not only by the\r\nnumber, but also by the kind of soldiers, veterans being mixed with\r\nthem. Before they marched out of the city, they engraved on brass, and\r\nfixed up in public view, the decemviral laws, which have received the\r\nname of \"the twelve tables.\" There are some who state that the ædiles\r\ndischarged that office by order of the tribunes.\r\n\r\n58. Caius Claudius, who, detesting the crimes of the decemvirs and,\r\nabove all, incensed at the arrogant conduct of his brother's son, had\r\nretired to Regillum, the country of his forefathers, having returned,\r\nthough now advanced in years, to deprecate the dangers impending over\r\nthat man, whose vices he had shunned, now clad in a mourning garment,\r\nwith the members of his family and his clients, went about the forum,\r\nand solicited the interest of the citizens individually, \"That they\r\nwould not cast such a stain on the Claudian family, as to consider them\r\ndeserving of imprisonment and chains; that a man whose image would be\r\nmost highly honoured with posterity, the framer of their laws and the\r\nfounder of Roman jurisprudence, lay in chains amongst nightly thieves\r\nand robbers. (He begged) that they would turn away their minds from\r\nresentment for a while to examination and reflection; and rather pardon\r\none at the intercession of so many members of the Claudian family, than\r\nthrough a hatred of one spurn the entreaties of many; that he himself\r\nalso paid this tribute to the family and the name; nor had he been\r\nreconciled to him, whose unfortunate situation he wished to relieve;\r\nthat by fortitude liberty had been recovered; by clemency the harmony of\r\nthe several orders might be established.\" Some there were whom he\r\ninfluenced more by his warm attachment to his family than for the sake\r\nof him for whom he interceded. But Virginius begged that \"they would\r\nrather pity him and his daughter; and that they would listen to the\r\nentreaties, not of the Claudian family, which had assumed a sort of\r\nsovereignty over the commons, but those of the near friends of Virginia\r\nand of the three tribunes; who having been created for the aid of the\r\ncommons, were now themselves imploring the protection and aid of the\r\ncommons.\" These tears appeared more just. Accordingly, all hope being\r\ncut off, Appius put a period to his life, before the day arrived\r\nappointed for his trial. Soon after, Spurius Oppius, the next object of\r\npublic indignation, as having been in the city when the unjust decision\r\nwas given by his colleague, was arraigned by Publius Numitorius.\r\nHowever, an act of injustice committed by Oppius brought more odium on\r\nhim, than the not preventing one (in the case of Appius). A witness was\r\nbrought forward, who, after reckoning up twenty campaigns, after having\r\nbeen particularly honoured eight different times, and wearing these\r\nhonours in the sight of the Roman people, tore open his garment and\r\nexhibited his back torn with stripes, asking no other conditions but\r\n\"that, if the accused could name any one guilty act of his, he might,\r\nthough a private individual, once more repeat his severity on him.\"\r\nOppius was also thrown into prison, where he put a period to his life\r\nbefore the day of trial. The tribunes confiscated the property of Appius\r\nand Oppius. Their colleagues left their homes to go into exile; their\r\nproperty was confiscated. Marcus Claudius, the claimant of Virginia,\r\nbeing condemned on the day of his trial, was discharged and went away\r\ninto exile to Tibur, Virginius himself remitting the penalty as far as\r\nit affected his life; and the shade of Virginia, more fortunate after\r\ndeath than when living, after having roamed through so many families in\r\nquest of vengeance, at length rested in peace, no guilty person being\r\nleft unpunished.\r\n\r\n59. Great alarm seized the patricians, and the countenances of the\r\ntribunes were now the same as those of the decemvirs had been, when\r\nMarcus Duilius, tribune of the people, having put a salutary check to\r\ntheir immoderate power, says, \"There has been both enough of liberty on\r\nour own part, and of vengeance on our enemies; wherefore for this year I\r\nwill neither suffer a day of trial to be appointed for any one, nor any\r\nperson to be thrown into prison. For it is neither pleasing to me that\r\nold crimes now forgotten should be again brought forward, seeing that\r\nthe recent ones have been atoned for by the punishment of the decemvirs;\r\nand the unremitting care of both the consuls in defending your\r\nliberties, is ample security that nothing will be committed which will\r\ncall for tribunitian interference.\" This moderation of the tribune first\r\nrelieved the patricians from their fears, and at the same time increased\r\ntheir ill-will towards the consuls; for they had been so devoted to the\r\ncommons, that even a plebeian magistrate took an earlier interest in\r\nthe safety and liberty of the patricians, than one of patrician rank;\r\nand their enemies would have been surfeited with inflicting punishments\r\non them, before the consuls, to all appearance, would have resisted\r\ntheir licentious career. And there were many who said that a want of\r\nfirmness was shown, inasmuch as the fathers had given their approbation\r\nto the laws proposed; nor was there a doubt, but that in this troubled\r\nstate of public affairs they had yielded to the times.\r\n\r\n60. The business in the city being settled, and the rights of the\r\ncommons being firmly established, the consuls departed to their\r\nrespective provinces. Valerius prudently deferred all warlike operations\r\nagainst the armies of the Æquans and the Volscians, which had now formed\r\na junction at Algidum. But if he had immediately committed the result to\r\nfortune, I know not but that, such were the feelings both of the Romans\r\nand of their enemies since the unfavourable auspices of the decemvirs,\r\nthe contest would have stood them in a heavy loss. Having pitched his\r\ncamp at the distance of a mile from the enemy, he kept his men quiet.\r\nThe enemy filled the space lying between the two camps with their army\r\nin order of battle, and not a single Roman made them any answer when\r\nthey challenged them to battle. At length, wearied from standing and\r\nfrom waiting in vain for a contest, the Æquans and Volscians,\r\nconsidering that the victory was in a manner conceded to them, go off,\r\nsome to the Hernicians, some to the Latins, to commit depredations.\r\nThere was left in the camp rather a garrison for its defence than\r\nsufficient force for a contest. When the consul perceived this, he\r\nretorted the terror previously occasioned to his men, and drawing up his\r\ntroops in order of battle, he now in his turn provokes the enemy to\r\nfight. When they, from a feeling of the absence of their forces,\r\ndeclined battle, the courage of the Romans immediately increased, and\r\nthey considered as vanquished those who stood panic-stricken within\r\ntheir rampart. After having stood for the entire day prepared for the\r\ncontest, they retired at night. And the Romans, now full of hope, set\r\nabout refreshing themselves. The enemy, in by no means equal spirits,\r\nbeing now in trepidation, despatch messengers in every direction to call\r\nback the plundering parties. Those in the nearest places return thence;\r\nthose who were farther off were not found. When the day dawned, the\r\nRomans leave the camp, determining on assaulting the rampart unless an\r\nopportunity of fighting were afforded; and when the day was now far\r\nadvanced, and no movement was made by the enemy, the consul orders them\r\nto advance; and the troops being put in motion, the Æquans and the\r\nVolscians became indignant, that victorious armies were to be defended\r\nby a rampart rather than by valour and arms. Wherefore they also\r\nearnestly demanded the signal for battle from their generals, and\r\nreceived it. And now half of them had got out of the gates, and the\r\nothers in succession were observing order, marching down each to his own\r\npost, when the Roman consul, before the enemy's line could be drawn up,\r\nsupported by their entire strength, advanced on them; and having\r\nattacked them before they were all as yet led forth, and when those who\r\nwere so had not their ranks sufficiently arranged, he falls on the\r\nunsteady crowd of them, running in trepidation from one place to\r\nanother, and throwing around their eyes on themselves and on their\r\nfriends, a shout and violent onset adding to the already confused state\r\nof their minds. The enemy at first gave way; then, when they had rallied\r\ntheir spirits, and their generals on every side reprovingly asked them,\r\nwhether they were about to yield to their vanquished foes, the battle\r\nwas restored.\r\n\r\n61. On the other side, the consul desired the Romans to remember that\r\n\"on that day, for the first time, they fought as free men in defence of\r\nRome, now a free city. That it was for themselves they were to conquer,\r\nand not that they should be the prize of the decemvirs, after\r\nconquering. That it was not under the command of Appius that the action\r\nwas being conducted, but under their consul Valerius, descended from the\r\nliberators of the Roman people, himself too a liberator. That they\r\nshould show that in former battles it had been the fault of the\r\ngenerals, and not of the soldiers, that they did not conquer. That it\r\nwas shameful to have had more courage against their own countrymen than\r\nagainst their enemies, and to have dreaded slavery more at home than\r\nabroad. That Virginia was the only person whose chastity was in danger\r\nin time of peace: that Appius was the only citizen of dangerous lust.\r\nBut if the fortune of war should turn against them, all their children\r\nwould be in danger from so many thousands of enemies. That he would\r\nnot, on account of the omen, mention things which may neither Jupiter\r\nnor their father Mars suffer to befall a city built under such\r\nauspices.\" He reminded them of the Aventine and the Sacred mount; and\r\n\"that they should bring back dominion unimpaired to that spot, where\r\ntheir liberty had been established but a few months before: and that\r\nthey should show that the Roman soldiers retained the same abilities\r\nafter the expulsion of the decemvirs, which they had possessed before\r\nthey were appointed; and that the valour of the Roman people was not\r\ndeteriorated after the laws were equalized.\" After he uttered these\r\nwords among the battalions of the infantry, he flies from them to the\r\ncavalry. \"Come, young men, surpass in valour the infantry, as you\r\nalready surpass them in honour and in rank. The infantry at the first\r\nonset have made the enemy give way: now that they have given way, do you\r\ngive reins to your horses and drive them from the field. They will not\r\nstand your charge: even now they rather hesitate than resist.\" They spur\r\non their horses, and drive in amongst the enemy who were already thrown\r\ninto confusion by the attack of the infantry; and having broken through\r\nthe ranks, and pushed on to the rear of their line, a part wheeling\r\nround in the open space, turn most of them away from the camp to which\r\nthey were now flying from all sides, and by riding on before they deter\r\nthem from that direction. The line of infantry, and the consul himself,\r\nand the main body of the army make for the camp, and having taken it\r\nwith considerable slaughter, they get possession of a great quantity of\r\nbooty. The fame of this battle was carried not only to the city, but to\r\nthe other army also among the Sabines. In the city it was celebrated\r\nonly with public rejoicing; in the camp it fired the courage of the\r\nsoldiers to emulate such glory. Horatius, by training them in\r\nexcursions, and making trial of them in slight skirmishes, had\r\naccustomed them to trust in themselves rather than to remember the\r\nignominy incurred under the command of the decemvirs, and these little\r\nencounters had now gone so far as to insure to them the consummation of\r\nall their hopes. The Sabines, elated at their success on the preceding\r\nyear, ceased not to provoke and urge them (to fight,) constantly asking\r\nthem why they wasted time, sallying forth in small numbers and returning\r\nlike marauders, and why they parcelled out the grand effort of a single\r\nwar on a number of insignificant skirmishes? why did they not engage\r\nthem in the field, and consign the result to fortune to be determined at\r\nonce?\r\n\r\n62. Besides that they had already of themselves recovered a sufficient\r\ndegree of courage, the Romans were fired with exasperation \"that the\r\nother army would soon return victorious to the city; that the enemy were\r\nnow wantonly insulting them by contumelies; when would they be a match\r\nfor the enemy, if they were not so then?\" When the consul ascertained\r\nthat the soldiers gave expression to these sentiments in the camp,\r\nhaving summoned an assembly: \"How matters have gone on in Algidum,\" says\r\nhe, \"I suppose that you, soldiers, have already heard. As became the\r\narmy of a free people to behave, so have they behaved: through the\r\njudicious conduct of my colleague and the valour of the soldiers, the\r\nvictory has been gained. For my part, the plan and determination which I\r\nam to maintain, you yourselves shall suggest. The war may be both\r\nprolonged with advantage, and be brought to a speedy conclusion. If it\r\nis to be prolonged, I shall take care by the same discipline with which\r\nI have commenced, that your hopes and your valour may increase every\r\nday. If you have now sufficient courage, and it is your wish that the\r\nmatter be decided, come on, raise here that shout such as you will raise\r\nin the field of battle, the index at once of your inclination and your\r\nvalour.\" When the shout was raised with great alacrity, he assures them\r\n\"that with the good favour of heaven, he would comply with their wishes\r\nand lead them next day to the field.\" The remainder of the day is spent\r\nin preparing their arms. On the following day, as soon as the Sabines\r\nsaw the Roman army being drawn up in order of battle, they too, as being\r\nlong since eager for the encounter, come forward. The battle was such a\r\none as may be expected between two armies confident in themselves, the\r\none animated by the glory of former and uninterrupted glory, the other\r\nlately so by an unusual instance of success. The Sabines aided their\r\nstrength by stratagem also; for having formed a line equal (to that of\r\nthe enemy,) they kept two thousand men in reserve, to make an attack on\r\nthe left wing of the Romans in the heat of the battle. When these, by an\r\nattack in flank, were overpowering that wing, now almost surrounded,\r\nabout six hundred of the cavalry of two legions leap down from their\r\nhorses, and rush forward in front of their men, now giving way; and they\r\nat the same time both oppose the progress of the enemy, and incite the\r\ncourage of the infantry, first sharing the danger equally with them, and\r\nthen by arousing in them a sense of shame. It was a matter of shame that\r\nthe cavalry should fight in their own proper character and in that of\r\nothers; and that the infantry should not be equal to the cavalry even\r\nwhen dismounted.\r\n\r\n63. They press forward therefore to the fight, which had been suspended\r\non their part, and endeavour to regain the ground which they had lost,\r\nand in a moment not only is the battle restored, but one of the wings of\r\nthe Sabines gives way. The cavalry, covered between the ranks of the\r\nfoot, return to their horses; they then gallop across to the other\r\ndivision to announce their success to their party; at the same time also\r\nthey make a charge on the enemy, now disheartened by the discomfiture of\r\ntheir stronger wing. The valour of none shone more conspicuous in that\r\nbattle. The consul provided for all emergencies; he applauded the brave,\r\nrebuked wherever the battle seemed to slacken. When reproved, they\r\ndisplayed immediately the energy of brave men; and a sense of shame\r\nstimulated them as much as praises excited the others. The shout being\r\nraised anew, and making a united effort, they drive the enemy back; nor\r\ncould the Roman power be any longer resisted. The Sabines, driven in\r\nevery direction through the country, leave behind them their camp as\r\nplunder for the enemy. There the Roman recovers the effects not of the\r\nallies, as at Algidum, but his own property, which had been lost by the\r\ndevastations of their lands. For this double victory, obtained in two\r\nbattles, in two different places, the senate through jealousy decreed\r\nmerely supplications in the name of the consuls for one day only. The\r\npeople went, however, on the second day also in great numbers of their\r\nown accord to offer thanksgiving; and this unauthorized and popular\r\nsupplication was even more zealously attended. The consuls by concert\r\ncame to the city within the same two days, and called out the senate to\r\nthe Campus Martius. Where, when they were relating the services\r\nperformed by themselves, the chiefs of the patricians complained that\r\nthe senate was convened among the soldiers designedly for the purpose of\r\nintimidation. The consuls therefore, lest there might be any foundation\r\nfor such a charge, called away the senate to the Flaminian meadows,\r\nwhere the temple of Apollo now is (even then they called it\r\nApollinaris). Where, when a triumph was refused by a large majority of\r\nthe patricians, Lucius Icilius, tribune of the commons, proposed to the\r\npeople regarding the triumph of the consuls, many persons coming forward\r\nto argue against the measure, but in particular Caius Claudius,\r\nexclaiming, \"That it was over the senate, not over the enemy, the\r\nconsuls wished to triumph; and that it was intended as a return for a\r\nprivate service to a tribune, and not as an honour due to valour. That\r\nnever before was the matter of a triumph managed through the people; but\r\nthat the consideration concerning the honour and the disposal of it,\r\nalways lay with the senate; that not even the kings had infringed on the\r\nmajesty of this highest order. That the tribunes should not thus occupy\r\nevery department with their own authority, so as to allow the existence\r\nof no public council; that the state would be free, and the laws\r\nequalized by these means only, if each rank would retain its own rights,\r\nits own dignity.\" Though much had been said by the other senior\r\npatricians also to the same purpose, all the tribes approved that\r\nproposition. Then for the first time a triumph was celebrated by order\r\nof the people, without the authority of the senate.\r\n\r\n64. This victory of the tribunes and people was well nigh terminating in\r\nan extravagance of a by no means salutary tendency, a conspiracy being\r\nformed among the tribunes to have the same tribunes re-elected, and in\r\norder that their ambition might be the less conspicuous, to continue\r\ntheir office to the consuls. They pleaded, as a cause, the combination\r\nof the patricians by which the privileges of the commons were attempted\r\nto be undermined by the affronts thrown upon the consuls. What would be\r\nthe consequence, before the laws are yet firmly established, if consuls\r\nshould through their factions attack the new tribunes. For that Horatii\r\nand Valerii would not always be consuls, who would postpone their own\r\ninterest to the liberty of the people. By some concurrence of\r\ncircumstances, useful at the time, it fell by lot to Marcus Duilius\r\nabove any one else to preside at the elections, a man of prudence, and\r\nwho perceived the storm of public odium that was hanging over them from\r\nthe continuance of their office. And when he stated that he would take\r\nno notice of the former tribunes, and his colleagues strenuously\r\ninsisted that he should allow the tribes to be at liberty to vote, or\r\nshould give up the office of presiding at the elections to his\r\ncolleagues, who would hold the election according to law rather than\r\naccording to the pleasure of the patricians; a contention being now\r\nexcited, when Duilius had sent for the consuls to his seat and asked\r\nthem what they contemplated doing with respect to the consular\r\nelections, and they answered that they would appoint new consuls, having\r\nfound popular supporters of a measure by no means popular, he proceeded\r\nwith them into the assembly. Where, when the consuls, being brought\r\nforward before the people, and asked, whether if the Roman people,\r\nmindful of their liberty recovered at home through them, mindful also of\r\ntheir military services, should again elect them consuls, what they\r\nwould do, made no change in their sentiments; he held the election,\r\nafter eulogizing the consuls, because they persevered to the last in\r\nbeing unlike the decemvirs; and five tribunes of the people being\r\nelected, when, through the zealous exertions of the nine tribunes who\r\nopenly pushed their canvass, the other candidates could not make up the\r\nrequired number of tribes, he dismissed the assembly; nor did he hold\r\none after for the purpose of an election. He said that he had fulfilled\r\nthe law, which without any where specifying the number of tribunes, only\r\nenacted that tribunes should be left; and recommended that colleagues be\r\nchosen by those who had been elected. And he recited the terms of the\r\nlaw, in which (it is said,) \"If I shall propose ten tribunes of the\r\ncommons, if you elect this day less than ten tribunes of the people,\r\nthen that those whom they may have chosen as colleagues for themselves\r\nbe legitimate tribunes of the people, by the same law as those whom you\r\nhave this day elected tribunes of the people.\" When Duilius persevered\r\nto the last, stating that the republic could not have fifteen tribunes\r\nof the people, after baffling the ambition of his colleagues, he\r\nresigned his office, being equally approved by the patricians and\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n65. The new tribunes of the people in electing their colleagues evinced\r\na disposition to gratify the wishes of the patricians; they even elected\r\ntwo who were patricians, and even consulars, Spurius Tarpeius and Aulus\r\nAterius. The consuls then elected, Largius Herminius, Titus Virginius\r\nCælimontanus not very much inclined to the cause either of the\r\npatricians or commons, had perfect tranquillity both at home and abroad.\r\nLucius Trebonius, tribune of the commons, incensed against the\r\npatricians, because, as he said, he was imposed on by them in the affair\r\nof choosing colleagues, and betrayed by his colleagues, carried a\r\nproposal, \"that whoever took the votes of the commons in electing\r\ntribunes of the people, he should go on taking the votes, until he\r\nelected ten tribunes of the people;\" and he spent his tribuneship in\r\nworrying the patricians, whence the cognomen of Asper was given him.\r\nNext Marcus Geganius Macerinus, and Caius Julius, being elected consuls,\r\nquieted some combinations of the tribunes against the youth of the\r\nnobility, without any harsh proceeding against that power, and still\r\npreserving the dignity of the patricians; by proclaiming a levy for the\r\nwar against the Volscians and Æquans, they kept the people from riots by\r\nkeeping matters in abeyance; affirming, that every thing was quiet\r\nabroad, there being harmony in the city, and that through civil discord\r\nthe enemies assumed new courage. Their anxiety for peace was also the\r\ncause of concord at home. But each of the orders ever took advantage of\r\nmoderation in the other. Acts of injustice began to be committed by the\r\nyounger patricians on the commons when perfectly quiet. When the\r\ntribunes would assist the weaker party, at first it was of little use;\r\nthen not even themselves escaped being ill-treated; particularly in the\r\nlatter months, when injustice was committed through the combinations\r\namong the more powerful, and the vigour of every magistracy becomes\r\nconsiderably more lax in the latter part of the year; and now the\r\ncommons placed hopes in the tribuneship, only on the condition that they\r\nhad tribunes like Icilius; that for the last two years they had had only\r\nmere names. On the other hand, the elder members of the patrician order,\r\nthough they considered their young men to be too overbearing, yet would\r\nrather, if bounds were to be exceeded, that a redundancy of spirit\r\nshould exist in their own order than in their adversaries. So difficult\r\na thing is moderation in maintaining liberty, whilst by pretending to\r\ndesire equalization, every person raises himself in such a manner as to\r\ndepress another; and men, by their very precautions against fear, cause\r\nthemselves to become objects of dread; and we saddle on others injustice\r\nthrown off from ourselves, as if it were actually necessary either to\r\ncommit injustice or to submit to it.\r\n\r\n66. Titus Quintius Capitolinus, for the fourth time, and Agrippa Furius\r\nbeing then elected consuls, found neither disturbance at home nor war\r\nabroad; both, however, were impending. The discord of the citizens could\r\nnow no longer be checked, both tribunes and commons being exasperated\r\nagainst the patricians, when a day of trial being appointed for any of\r\nthe nobility always embroiled the assemblies with new contests. On the\r\nfirst noise of which the Æquans and Volscians, as if they had received a\r\nsignal, took up arms; at the same time because their leaders, desirous\r\nof plunder, had persuaded them that the levy proclaimed two years\r\npreviously could not be proceeded with, the commons now refusing\r\nobedience; that on that account no armies were sent against them; that\r\nmilitary discipline was subverted by licentiousness; and that Rome was\r\nno longer considered as their common country; that whatever resentment\r\nand animosity they may have entertained against foreigners, was now\r\nturned against each other; that now an occasion offered for destroying\r\nthose wolves blinded by intestine rage. Having united their forces, they\r\nfirst laid waste the Latin territory: when no resistance was found\r\nthere, then indeed, to the great exultation of the advisers of the war,\r\nthey approached the very walls of Rome, carrying their depredations into\r\nthe district around the Esquiline gate, pointing out to the city the\r\ndevastation of the land by way of insult. Whence when they marched back\r\nto Corbio unmolested, and driving the prey before them, Quintius the\r\nconsul summoned the people to an assembly.\r\n\r\n67. There I find that he spoke to this purport: \"Though I am conscious\r\nto myself of no fault, Romans, yet with the greatest shame I have come\r\nforward to your assembly. That you should know this; that this should be\r\nhanded down on record to posterity, that the Æquans and Volscians, a\r\nshort time since scarcely a match for the Hernicians, have with impunity\r\ncome with arms in their hands to the walls of Rome, in the fourth\r\nconsulate of Titus Quintius. Had I known that this ignominy was reserved\r\nfor this particular year, (though we are now long living in such a\r\nmanner, such is the state of affairs, that my mind could augur nothing\r\ngood,) I would have avoided this honour either by exile or by death, if\r\nthere were no other means of escaping it. Then if men of courage had\r\nthose arms, which were at our gates, could Rome be taken in my\r\nconsulate? I have had sufficient honours, enough and more than enough of\r\nlife: I should have died in my third consulate. Whom did these most\r\ndastardly enemies despise? us, consuls, or you, citizens? If the fault\r\nis in us, take away the command from us as unworthy persons; and if that\r\nis insufficient, further inflict punishment on us. If in you, may there\r\nbe none of gods or men who will punish your offences; do you only repent\r\nof them. It is not your cowardice they have despised, nor their own\r\nvalour they have confided in; for having been so often routed and put to\r\nflight, stripped of their camp, amerced in their land, sent under the\r\nyoke, they know both themselves and you. The discord among the several\r\norders is the bane of this city; the contests of the patricians and\r\ncommons have raised their spirits; whilst we have neither bounds in the\r\npursuit of power, nor you in that of liberty, whilst you are tired of\r\npatrician, these of plebeian magistrates. In the name of heaven, what\r\nwould ye have? You coveted tribunes of the commons; we conceded them for\r\nthe sake of concord. Ye longed for decemvirs; we suffered them to be\r\ncreated. Ye became weary of decemvirs; we compelled them to resign the\r\noffice. Your resentment against these same persons when they became\r\nprivate citizens still continuing, we suffered men of the highest\r\nfamilies and rank to die or go into exile. Ye wished again to create\r\ntribunes of the commons; ye created them. Though we saw that it was\r\nunjust to the patricians to create consuls in your own interest, we have\r\neven seen a patrician magistracy conceded as an offering to the people.\r\nThe aid of tribunes, right of appeal to the people, the acts of the\r\ncommons made binding on the patricians under the pretext of equalizing\r\nthe laws, the subversion of our privileges, we have borne and still\r\nbear. What termination is there to be to our dissensions? when shall it\r\nbe allowed us to have a united city? when to have one common country?\r\nWhen defeated we submit with more resignation than you when victorious.\r\nIs it enough for you, that you are objects of terror to us? The Aventine\r\nis taken against us; against us the Sacred mount is seized. When the\r\nEsquiliæ is almost taken by the enemy, and when the Volscian foe is\r\nscaling your rampart, there is no one to dislodge him: against us ye\r\nare men, against us ye take up arms.\r\n\r\n68. \"Come, when ye have blockaded the senate-house here, and have made\r\nthe forum the seat of war, and filled the prison with the leading men of\r\nthe state, march forth through the Esquiline gate, with that same\r\ndetermined spirit; or if ye do not even venture thus far, behold from\r\nyour walls the lands laid waste with fire and sword, booty driven off,\r\nthe houses set on fire in every direction and smoking. But (I may be\r\ntold) it is the public weal that is in a worse condition through these\r\nresults: the land is burned, the city is besieged, all the glory of the\r\nwar is centred in the enemy. What in the name of heaven? in what state\r\nis your own private interest? just now his own private losses were\r\nannounced to each of you from the lands. What, pray, is there at home,\r\nwhence you may recruit them? Will the tribunes restore and compensate\r\nyou for what ye have lost? Of sound and words they will heap on you as\r\nmuch as ye please, and of charges against the leading men, and laws one\r\nupon another, and of public meetings. But from these meetings never has\r\none of you returned home more increased in substance or in fortune. Has\r\nany one ever brought back to his wife and children aught save hatred,\r\nquarrels, grudges public and private? from which (and their effects) you\r\nhave been ever protected, not by your own valour and integrity, but by\r\nthe aid of others. But, when you served under the guidance of us\r\nconsuls, not under your tribunes, and the enemy trembled at your shout\r\nin the field of battle, not the Roman patricians in the assembly, booty\r\nbeing obtained, land taken from the enemy, with a plentiful stock of\r\nwealth and glory, both public and private, you used to return home to\r\nyour household gods in triumph: now you allow the enemy to go off laden\r\nwith your property. Continue immovably tied to your assemblies, live in\r\nthe forum; the necessity of taking the field, which ye avoid, still\r\nfollows you. Was it too hard on you to march against the Æquans and the\r\nVolscians? The war is at your gates: if it is not repelled from thence,\r\nit will soon be within your walls, and will scale the citadel and\r\nCapitol, and follow you into your very houses. Two years ago the senate\r\nordered a levy to be held, and the army to march to Algidum; yet we sit\r\ndown listless at home, quarrelling with each other like women;\r\ndelighting in present peace, and not seeing that after that short-lived\r\nintermission complicated wars are sure to return. That there are other\r\ntopics more pleasing than these, I well know; but even though my own\r\nmind did not prompt me to it, necessity obliges me to speak that which\r\nis true instead of that which is pleasing. I would indeed be anxious to\r\nplease you, Romans; but I am much more anxious that ye should be\r\npreserved, whatever sentiments ye shall entertain towards me. It has\r\nbeen so ordained by nature, that he who addresses a multitude for his\r\nown private interest, is more pleasing than the man whose mind has\r\nnothing in view but the public interest. Unless perhaps you suppose that\r\nthose public sycophants, those flatterers of the commons, who neither\r\nsuffer you to take up arms nor to live in peace, incite and work you up\r\nfor your own interests. When excited, you are to them sources either of\r\nhonour or of profit: and because, during concord between the several\r\norders, they see that themselves are of no importance on any side, they\r\nwish to be leaders of a bad cause rather than of no cause whatever, of\r\ntumults, and of sedition. Of which state of things, if a tedium can at\r\nlength enter your minds, and if ye are willing to resume the modes of\r\nacting practised by your forefathers, and formerly by yourselves, I\r\nsubmit to any punishment, if I do not rout and put to flight, and strip\r\nof their camp, those ravagers of our lands, and transfer from our gates\r\nand walls to their cities this terror of war, by which you are now\r\nthrown into consternation.\"\r\n\r\n69. Scarcely ever was the speech of a popular tribune more acceptable to\r\nthe commons, than was this of a most strict consul on that occasion. The\r\nyoung men also, who during such alarming emergencies had been accustomed\r\nto employ the refusal to enlist as the sharpest weapon against the\r\npatricians, began to direct their thoughts to war and arms: and the\r\nflight of the rustics, and those who had been robbed on the lands and\r\nwounded, announcing matters more revolting even than what was exhibited\r\nto view, filled the whole city with a spirit of vengeance. When the\r\nsenate assembled, these all turning to Quintius, looked on him as the\r\nonly champion of Roman majesty; and the leading senators declared \"his\r\nharangue to be worthy of the consular authority, worthy of so many\r\nconsulships formerly borne by him, worthy of his whole life, which was\r\nfull of honours frequently enjoyed, more frequently deserved. That\r\nother consuls had either flattered the commons by betraying the dignity\r\nof the patricians, or by harshly maintaining the rights of their order,\r\nhad rendered the multitude more difficult to subdue: that Titus Quintius\r\nhad delivered a speech mindful of the dignity of the patricians, of the\r\nconcord of the different orders, and above all, of the times. They\r\nentreated him and his colleague to take up the interest of the\r\ncommonwealth; they entreated the tribunes, that by acting in concert\r\nwith the consuls they would join in repelling the war from the city and\r\nthe walls, and that they would induce the commons to be obedient to the\r\nsenate in so perilous a conjuncture: that, their lands being devastated,\r\nand their city in a manner besieged, their common country appealed to\r\nthem as tribunes, and implored their aid.\" By universal consent the levy\r\nis decreed and held. When the consuls gave public notice \"that there was\r\nno time for examining into excuses, that all the young men should attend\r\non the following morning at the first dawn in the Campus Martius; that\r\nwhen the war was over, they should afford time for inquiring into the\r\nexcuses of those who had not given in their names; that the man should\r\nbe held as a deserter, with whose excuse they might not be satisfied;\"\r\nthe entire youth attended on the following day. The cohorts chose each\r\ntheir centurions: two senators were placed at the head of each cohort.\r\nWe have heard that all these measures were perfected with such\r\nexpedition, that the standards, having been brought forth from the\r\ntreasury on that very day by the quæstors and conveyed to the Campus,\r\nbegan to move from thence at the fourth hour; and the newly raised army\r\nhalted at the tenth stone, followed by a few cohorts of veteran soldiers\r\nas volunteers. The following day brought the enemy within view, and camp\r\nwas joined to camp near Corbio. On the third day, when resentment urged\r\non the Romans, a consciousness of guilt for having so often rebelled,\r\nand despair (of pardon) urged them on the other side, there was no delay\r\nmade in coming to an engagement.\r\n\r\n70. In the Roman army, though the two consuls were invested with equal\r\nauthority, the supreme command was by the concession of Agrippa resigned\r\nto his colleague, a thing which is most salutary in the management of\r\nmatters of great importance; and he who was preferred politely\r\nresponded to the ready condescension of him who lowered himself, by\r\ncommunicating to him all his measures and sharing with him his honours,\r\nand by equalizing himself to him no longer his equal. On the field of\r\nbattle Quintius commanded the right, Agrippa the left wing; the command\r\nof the central line is intrusted to Spurius Postumius Albus, as\r\nlieutenant-general. Servius Sulpicius, the other lieutenant-general,\r\nthey place over the cavalry. The infantry on the right wing fought with\r\ndistinguished valour, with stout resistance from the Volscians. Servius\r\nSulpicius broke with his cavalry through the centre of the enemy's line;\r\nwhence though he might have returned in the same way to his own party,\r\nbefore the enemy could have restored their broken ranks, it seemed more\r\nadvisable to attack the enemy's rear, and by attacking the rear he would\r\nin a moment have dispersed the enemy by the twofold attack, had not the\r\ncavalry of the Volscians and Æquans intercepted him and kept him engaged\r\nby a mode of fighting similar to his own. Then indeed Sulpicius asserted\r\nthat \"there was no time for delaying,\" crying out that \"they were\r\nsurrounded and cut off from their own friends, unless they united all\r\ntheir efforts and despatched the engagement with the cavalry. Nor was it\r\nenough to rout the enemy without disabling them; that they should slay\r\nhorses and men, lest any might return to the fight or renew the battle;\r\nthat they could not resist them, before whom a compact body of infantry\r\nhad given way.\" His orders were addressed to by no means deaf ears; by\r\none charge they routed the entire cavalry, dismounted great numbers, and\r\nkilled with their javelins both the men and the horses. This put a\r\ntermination to the battle with the cavalry. Then attacking the enemy's\r\nline, they send an account to the consuls of what they had done, where\r\nthe enemy's line was now giving way. The news both gave new spirits to\r\nthe Romans who were now conquering, and dismayed the Æquans as they were\r\nbeginning to give way. They first began to be beaten in the centre,\r\nwhere the charge of the cavalry had broken their ranks. Then the left\r\nwing began to lose ground before the consul Quintius; there was most\r\ndifficulty on the right. Then Agrippa, buoyed up by youth and vigour, on\r\nseeing matters going more favourably in every part of the battle than in\r\nhis own quarter, took some of the standards from the standard-bearers\r\nand carried them on himself, some even he began to throw into the thick\r\nof the enemy. The soldiers, urged on by the fear of this disgrace,\r\nattacked the enemy; thus the victory was equalized in every quarter.\r\nNews then came from Quintius that he, being now victorious, was about to\r\nattack the enemy's camp; that he was unwilling to break into it before\r\nhe learned that they were beaten in the left wing also. If he had routed\r\nthe enemy, that he should now join him, that all the army together might\r\ntake possession of the booty. Agrippa being victorious came with mutual\r\ncongratulations to his victorious colleague and to the enemy's camp.\r\nThere being but few to defend it, and these being routed in a moment,\r\nthey break into the fortifications without a struggle; and they march\r\nback the army after it obtained a large share of spoil, having recovered\r\nalso their own effects, which had been lost by the devastation of the\r\nlands. I have not ascertained that either they themselves demanded a\r\ntriumph, nor that such was conferred on them by the senate; nor is any\r\ncause assigned for the honour being either overlooked or not hoped for.\r\nAs far as I can conjecture at so great a distance of time, when a\r\ntriumph had been refused to the consuls Horatius and Valerius, who, in\r\naddition to the Æquans and Volscians, had gained the glory of finishing\r\nthe Sabine war, the consuls were ashamed to demand a triumph for one\r\nhalf of the services done by them; lest if they even should obtain it,\r\nregard of persons rather than of merit might appear to have been\r\nentertained.\r\n\r\n71. A disgraceful decision of the people regarding the boundaries of\r\ntheir allies disgraced the honourable victory obtained over their\r\nenemies. The states of Aricia and of Ardea, having frequently contended\r\nin arms concerning a disputed piece of land, and being wearied out by\r\nmany mutual losses, appointed the Roman people as arbitrators. When they\r\ncame to support their claims, an assembly of the people being granted\r\nthem by the magistrates, a debate ensued conducted with great warmth.\r\nAnd the witnesses being now produced, when the tribes were to be called,\r\nand the people were to give their votes, Publius Scaptius, a plebeian\r\nadvanced in years, rises up and says; \"Consuls, if it is permitted me to\r\nspeak on the public interest, I will not suffer the people to be led\r\ninto a mistake in this matter.\" When the consuls said that he, as\r\nunworthy of attention, was not to be heard and, on his exclaiming \"that\r\nthe public interest was being betrayed,\" ordered him to be put aside, he\r\nappeals to the tribunes. The tribunes, as they are always directed by\r\nthe multitude, rather than they direct them, indulged the people, who\r\nwere anxious to hear him, in granting Scaptius leave to say what he\r\npleased. He then commences: \"That he was in his eighty-third year, and\r\nthat he had served in that district which was now in dispute, not even\r\nthen a young man as he was serving his twentieth campaign, when\r\noperations were going on at Corioli. He therefore adduced a fact\r\nforgotten by length of time, but one deeply fixed in his own memory: the\r\ndistrict now in dispute had belonged to the territory of Corioli, and\r\nafter the taking of Corioli, it became by right of war the public\r\nproperty of the Roman people. That he was surprised how the states of\r\nArdea and Aricia should hope to intercept from the Roman people, whom\r\nfrom being the right owners they made arbitrators, a district the right\r\nto which they never claimed whilst the state of Corioli subsisted. That\r\nhe for his part had but a short time to live; he could not however bring\r\nhimself, old as he now was, to decline claiming by his voice, the only\r\nmeans he now had, a district which, as a soldier, he had contributed to\r\nacquire, as far as an individual could. That he strenuously advised the\r\npeople not to damn their own interest by an improper feeling of\r\ndelicacy.\"\r\n\r\n72. The consuls, when they perceived that Scaptius was listened to not\r\nonly in silence, but even with approbation, appealing to gods and men,\r\nthat an enormous and disgraceful act was being committed, send for the\r\nprincipal senators: with these they went around to the tribunes;\r\nentreated, \"that, as judges, they would not be guilty of a most heinous\r\ncrime, with a still worse precedent, by converting the dispute to their\r\nown interest, more especially when, even though it may be lawful for a\r\njudge to protect his own emolument, so much would by no means be\r\nacquired by keeping the land, as would be lost by alienating the\r\naffections of their allies by injustice; for that the losses of\r\ncharacter and of reputation were greater than could be estimated. Were\r\nthe ambassadors to carry home this answer; was this to go out to the\r\nworld; were their allies to hear this; were their enemies to hear\r\nit--with what sorrow the one--with what joy the other party? Could they\r\nsuppose, that the neighbouring states would impute this proceeding to\r\nScaptius, an old babbler at assemblies? that Scaptius would be rendered\r\ndistinguished by this statue: that the Roman people would assume the\r\ncharacter of a usurper and intercepter of the claims of others. For what\r\njudge in a private cause ever acted in this way, so as to adjudge to\r\nhimself the property in dispute? That even Scaptius himself would not\r\nact so, though he has now outlived all sense of shame.\" Thus the\r\nconsuls, thus the senators exclaimed; but covetousness, and Scaptius,\r\nthe adviser of that covetousness, had more influence. The tribes, when\r\nconvened, decided that the district was the public property of the Roman\r\npeople. Nor is it denied that it might have been so, if they had gone to\r\nother judges; now the disgrace of the decision is certainly not at all\r\ndiminished by the fairness of the title: nor did it appear more\r\ndisgraceful or more hideous to the people of Aricia and of Ardea, than\r\nit did to the Roman senate. The remainder of the year continued free\r\nfrom either city or foreign commotions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _A law was passed concerning the intermarriage of the patricians\r\n     and plebeians, after strong resistance on the part of the\r\n     patricians.

For at the commencement of the\r\nyear Caius Canuleius, tribune of the people, proposed a law concerning\r\nthe intermarriage of the patricians and commons; by which the patricians\r\nconsidered that their blood would be contaminated, and the privileges of\r\nbirth would be confounded; and a hint at first lightly suggested by the\r\ntribunes, that it should be lawful that one of the consuls should be\r\nelected from the commons, afterwards proceeded so far, that the nine\r\ntribunes proposed a bill, \"that the people should have the power of\r\nelecting the consuls, whether they wished, from the commons or the\r\npatricians. But they thought that if that were done, the supreme\r\nauthority would not only be shared with the lowest ranks, but be wholly\r\ntransferred from the nobility to the commons. With joy therefore the\r\npatricians heard that the people of Ardea had revolted in consequence of\r\nthe injustice of the taking away their land, and that the Veientians had\r\nlaid waste the frontiers of the Roman territory, and that the Volscians\r\nand Æquans murmured on account of the fortifying of Verrago; so much did\r\nthey prefer an unsuccessful war to an ignominious peace.\" These tidings\r\ntherefore being received and with exaggerations, in order that during\r\nthe din of so many wars the tribunitian proceedings might be suspended,\r\nthey order the levies to be held, preparations to be made for war and\r\narms with the utmost activity; with more energy, if possible, than had\r\nbeen used in the consulship of Titus Quintius. Then Caius Canuleius\r\ndeclared aloud in brief terms in the senate, that \"the consuls wished in\r\nvain to divert the commons from attention to the new laws; that they\r\nnever should hold a levee while he lived, before the commons had first\r\nratified the laws proposed by him and his colleagues;\" and he instantly\r\nsummoned them to an assembly.\r\n\r\n2. Both the consuls incited the senate against the tribune, and the\r\ntribune the people against the consuls at one and the same time. The\r\nconsuls denied \"that tribunitian frenzies could any longer be endured;\r\nthat they were now come to a crisis; that more hostilities were being\r\nstirred up at home than abroad. That this happened not more through the\r\nfault of the commons than of the patricians; nor more through that of\r\nthe tribunes than of the consuls. That the matter for which there was a\r\nreward in the state thrived always with the greatest proficiency; that\r\nthus it was that men became meritorious in peace, thus in war. That at\r\nRome the highest reward was for sedition; that had ever been the source\r\nof honour both to individuals and to collective bodies. They should\r\nremember in what condition they had received the majesty of the senate\r\nfrom their forefathers, in what condition they were about to transmit it\r\nto their children; that, like the commons, they should have it in their\r\npower to boast that it was improved in degree and in splendour. That\r\nthere was no end, nor would there be, so long as the promoters of\r\nsedition were rewarded with honour in proportion as sedition was\r\nsuccessful. What and how important schemes Caius Canuleius had set on\r\nfoot! that he was introducing confounding of family rank, a disturbance\r\nof the auspices both public and private, that nothing may remain pure,\r\nnothing uncontaminated; that, all distinction being abolished, no one\r\nmight know either himself or those he belonged to. For what other\r\ntendency had those promiscuous intermarriages, except that intercourse\r\nbetween commons and patricians might be made common after the manner of\r\nwild beasts; so that of the offspring each may be ignorant of what blood\r\nhe may be, of what form of religion he was; that he may belong half to\r\nthe patricians, half to the commons, not being homogeneous even with\r\nhimself? That it appeared not enough, that all things divine and human\r\nshould be confounded; that those disturbers of the common people were\r\nnow preparing to (seize) the consulship; and first that they sounded\r\npeople's sentiments in mere conversation on the project of having one\r\nconsul appointed from the commons; that now the proposition was brought\r\nforward, that the people may appoint the consuls, whether they pleased\r\nfrom the patricians or from the people; and that they would appoint no\r\ndoubt every most turbulent person. The Canuleii, therefore, and the\r\nIcilii would be consuls. (They expressed a hope) that Jupiter, the best\r\nand greatest, would not suffer the imperial majesty of the sovereign\r\npower to descend to that; and that they would certainly die a thousand\r\ndeaths rather than such a disgrace should be incurred. They were certain\r\nthat their ancestors, could they have divined that the commons would\r\nbecome not more placable to them, but more intractable, by making\r\nsuccessive demands still more unreasonable, after they had obtained the\r\nfirst, would have rather submitted to any struggle, than have suffered\r\nsuch laws to be saddled on them. Because it was then conceded to them\r\nwith respect to tribunes, the concession was made a second time. There\r\nwas no end to it; tribunes of the commons and patricians could not\r\nsubsist in the same state; either the one order or the other office must\r\nbe abolished; and that a stop should be put to presumption and temerity\r\nrather late than never. (Was it right) that they, by sowing discord,\r\nshould with impunity stir up the neighbouring states against us? and\r\nthen prevent the state from arming and defending itself against those\r\nevils which they may have brought on us? and after they have almost sent\r\nfor the enemy, not suffer the armies to be levied against the enemies?\r\nBut Canuleius may have the audacity to declare openly in the senate\r\nthat, unless the patrician suffer the laws proposed by himself as\r\nvictorious, to be enacted, he would prevent the levy from being held.\r\nWhat else was this, but threatening that he would betray his country;\r\nthat he would suffer it to be attacked and captured? What courage would\r\nthat expression afford, not to the Roman commons, but to the Volscians,\r\nÆquans, and the Veientians! would they not hope that, under the\r\ngeneralship of Canuleius, they should be able to scale the Capitol and\r\ncitadel, if with the deprivation of privilege and majesty, the tribunes\r\nshould rob the patricians of their courage also? That the consuls were\r\nprepared to act against the wicked schemes of their countrymen, before\r\nthey would act against the arms of the enemy.\"\r\n\r\n3. Just when these matters were going on in the senate, Canuleius thus\r\ndeclaimed in favour of his laws and against the consuls: \"Frequently\r\neven before now I think I have observed how much the patricians despised\r\nyou, Romans, how unworthy they deemed you to dwell in the one city and\r\nwithin the same walls with them; but on the present occasion most\r\nclearly, in their having risen up so determinedly in opposition to those\r\npropositions of ours: in which what else do we do, but remind them that\r\nwe are their fellow citizens, and that though we possess not the same\r\npower, we inhabit the same city? In the one we demand intermarriage, a\r\nthing which is usually granted to neighbours and foreigners: we have\r\ngranted even to vanquished enemies the right of citizenship, which is\r\nmore than the right of intermarriage. In the other we propose nothing\r\nnew; we only reclaim and demand that which is the people's; that the\r\nRoman people may confer honours on whomsoever they may please. And what\r\nin the name of goodness is it for which they embroil heaven and earth?\r\nwhy was almost an attack made on me just now in the senate? why do they\r\nsay that they will not restrain themselves from violence, and threaten\r\nthat they will insult an office, sacred and inviolable? Shall this city\r\nno longer be able to stand, and is the empire at stake, if the right of\r\nfree suffrage is granted to the Roman people, to confer the consulship\r\non whomsoever they may please, and if a plebeian, though he may be\r\nworthy of the highest honour, is not precluded from the hope of\r\nattaining that honour? and is this of the same import, whether a\r\nplebeian be made a consul, as if any one were to propose a slave or the\r\nson of a slave to be consul? Do you perceive in what contempt you live?\r\nthey would take from you a participation in this light, if it were\r\npermitted them. That you breathe, that you enjoy the faculty of speech,\r\nthat you possess the forms of human beings, excites their indignation.\r\nNay even, as I hope for mercy, they say that it is contrary to religion\r\nthat a plebeian should be made consul. I pray, though we are not\r\nadmitted to the annals, nor to the commentaries of the pontiffs, do we\r\nnot know even those things which strangers know? that consuls have\r\nsucceeded kings? and that they possess no privilege, no majesty which\r\nwas not formerly inherent in kings? Do you suppose that we ever heard it\r\nmentioned that Numa Pompilius, who not only was not a patrician, but not\r\neven a citizen of Rome, was sent for from the country of the Sabines by\r\norder of the people, with the approbation of the senate, and that he was\r\nmade king at Rome? that afterwards Lucius Tarquinius, who was not only\r\nnot of Roman, but not even of Italian extraction, the son of Damaratus\r\nof Corinth, an emigrant from Tarquinii, was made king, even whilst the\r\nsons of Ancus still lived? that after him Servius Tullius, the son of a\r\ncaptive woman of Corniculum, with his father unknown, his mother a\r\nslave, attained the throne by his ability and merit? For what shall I\r\nsay of Titus Tatius the Sabine, whom Romulus himself, the founder of our\r\ncity, admitted into partnership of the throne? Accordingly, whilst no\r\nclass of persons is disdained, in whom conspicuous merit may be found,\r\nthe Roman dominion increased. You do well to be dissatisfied now with a\r\nplebeian consul, when your ancestors disdained not foreigners as kings,\r\nand when, even after the expulsion of kings, the city was not shut\r\nagainst foreign merit. After the expulsion of the kings, we certainly\r\nadmitted the Claudian family from the Sabine country not only into\r\ncitizenship, but even into the number of the patricians. Can a man from\r\na foreigner be made a patrician, then a consul? shall a Roman citizen,\r\nif he belong to the commons, be precluded from all hope of the\r\nconsulate? Do we then deem it impossible that a man of the commons can\r\nbe a person of fortitude and activity, qualified to excel both in peace\r\nand war, tyke to Numa, Lucius Tarquinius, and Servius Tullius? Or,\r\nshould such appear, shall we not suffer him to meddle with the helm of\r\ngovernment? or shall we have consuls like the decemvirs, the most\r\nabandoned of mortals, who were, however, all patricians, rather than\r\nlike the best of kings, though new men?\r\n\r\n4. \"But (I may be told) no commoner has been consul since the expulsion\r\nof the kings. What then? ought no innovation to be introduced? and what\r\nhas not yet been practised, (and in a new state there are many things\r\nnot yet practised,) ought not even such measures, even though they be\r\nuseful, be adopted? During the reign of Romulus there were no pontiffs,\r\nnor augurs: they were appointed by Numa Pompilius. There was no census\r\nin the state, nor the distribution of centuries and classes; it was\r\nintroduced by Servius Tullius: there never had been consuls; they were\r\ncreated after the expulsion of the kings. Of a dictator neither the\r\noffice nor the name had existed; it commenced its existence among the\r\nsenators. There were no tribunes of the people, ædiles, nor quæstors: it\r\nwas resolved that those officers should be appointed. Within the last\r\nten years we both created decemvirs for compiling laws, and we abolished\r\nthem. Who can doubt but that in a city doomed for eternal duration,\r\nincreasing to an immense magnitude, new civil offices, priesthoods,\r\nrights of families and of individuals, may be established? This very\r\nmatter, that there should not be the right of intermarriage between\r\npatricians and commons, did not the decemvirs introduce within the last\r\nfew years to the utmost injury of the commons, on a principle most\r\ndetrimental to the public? Can there be a greater or more marked insult,\r\nthan that one portion of the state, as if contaminated, should be deemed\r\nunworthy of intermarriage? What else is it than to suffer exile within\r\nthe same walls, actual rustication? They wish to prevent our being mixed\r\nwith them by affinity or consanguinity; that our blood be not mingled\r\nwith theirs. What? if this cast a stain on that nobility of yours, which\r\nmost of you, the progeny of Albans or Sabines, possess, not in right of\r\nbirth or blood, but by co-optation into the patricians, having been\r\nelected either by the kings, or after the expulsion of kings, by order\r\nof the people, could ye not keep it pure by private regulations, by\r\nneither marrying into the commons, and by not suffering your daughters\r\nor sisters to marry out of the patricians. No one of the commons would\r\noffer violence to a patrician maiden; such lust as that belongs to the\r\npatricians. None of them would oblige any man against his will to enter\r\ninto a marriage contract. But really that such a thing should be\r\nprevented by law, that the intermarriage of the patricians and plebeians\r\nshould be interdicted, that it is which is insulting to the commons. Why\r\ndo you not combine in enacting a law that there shall be no\r\nintermarriage between rich and poor? That which has in all places and\r\nalways been the business of private regulations, that a woman might\r\nmarry into whatever family she has been engaged to, and that each man\r\nmight take a wife out of whatever family he had contracted with, that ye\r\nshackle with the restraints of a most tyrannical law, by which ye sever\r\nthe bonds of civil society and split one state into two. Why do ye not\r\nenact a law that a plebeian shall not dwell in the neighbourhood of a\r\npatrician? that he shall not go the same road with him? that he shall\r\nnot enter the same banquet with him? that he shall not stand in the same\r\nforum? For what else is there in the matter, if a patrician man wed a\r\nplebeian woman, or a plebeian a patrician? What right, pray, is thereby\r\nchanged? the children surely go with the father. Nor is there any thing\r\nwhich we seek from intermarriage with you, except that we may be held in\r\nthe number of human beings and fellow citizens; nor is there any reason\r\nwhy ye contest the point, except that it delights you to strive for\r\ninsult and ignominy to us.\r\n\r\n5. \"In a word, whether is the supreme power belonging to the Roman\r\npeople, or is it yours? Whether by the expulsion of kings has dominion\r\nbeen acquired for you or equal liberty for all? It is fitting that the\r\nRoman people should be allowed to enact a law, if it please. Or will ye\r\ndecree a levy by way of punishment, according as each bill shall be\r\nproposed? and as soon as I, as tribune, shall begin to call the tribes\r\nto give their votes, will you, forthwith, as consul, force the younger\r\nmen to take the military oath, and lead them out to camp? and will you\r\nthreaten the commons? will you threaten the tribune? What, if you had\r\nnot already twice experienced how little those threats availed against\r\nthe united sense of the people? Of course it was because you wished to\r\nconsult for our interest, that you abstained from force. Or was there no\r\ncontest for this reason, that the party which was the stronger was also\r\nthe more moderate? Nor will there be any contest now, Romans: they will\r\ntry your spirit; your strength they will not make trial of. Wherefore,\r\nconsuls, the commons are prepared to accompany you to these wars,\r\nwhether real or fictitious, if, by restoring the right of intermarriage,\r\nyou at length make this one state; if they can coalesce, be united and\r\nmixed with you by private ties; if the hope, if the access to honours\r\nbe granted to men of ability and energy; if it is lawful to be in a\r\npartnership and share of the government; if, what is the result of equal\r\nfreedom, it be allowed in the distribution of the annual offices to obey\r\nand to govern in their turns. If any one shall obstruct these measures,\r\ntalk about wars, multiply them by report; no one will give in his name,\r\nno one will take up arms, no one will fight for haughty masters, with\r\nwhom there is no participation of honours in public, nor of\r\nintermarriage in private.\"\r\n\r\n6. When both the consuls came forward into the assembly, and the matter\r\nhad changed from a long series of harangues to altercation, the tribune,\r\non asking why it was not right that a plebeian should be made a consul,\r\nan answer was returned truly perhaps, though by no means expediently for\r\nthe present contest, \"that no plebeian could have the auspices, and for\r\nthis reason the decemvirs had prohibited the intermarriage, lest from\r\nuncertainty of descent the auspices might be vitiated.\" The commons were\r\nfired with indignation at this above all, because, as if hateful to the\r\nimmortal gods, they were denied to be qualified to take auspices. And\r\nnow (as the commons both had a most energetic supporter in the tribune,\r\nand they themselves vied with him in perseverance) there was no end of\r\nthe contentions, until the patricians, being at length overpowered,\r\nagreed that the law regarding intermarriage should be passed, judging\r\nthat by these means most probably the tribunes would either give up\r\naltogether or postpone till after the war the question concerning the\r\nplebeian consuls; and that in the mean time the commons, content with\r\nthe intermarriage-law (being passed,) would be ready to enlist. When\r\nCanuleius was now in high repute by his victory over the patricians and\r\nby the favour of the commons, the other tribunes being excited to\r\ncontend for their bill, set to work with all their might, and, the\r\naccounts regarding the war augmenting daily, obstruct the levy. The\r\nconsuls, when nothing could be transacted through the senate in\r\nconsequence of the opposition of the tribunes, held meetings of the\r\nleading men at their own houses. It was becoming evident that they must\r\nconcede the victory either to the enemies or to their countrymen.\r\nValerius and Horatius alone of the consulars did not attend the\r\nmeetings. The opinion of Caius Claudius was for arming the consuls\r\nagainst the tribunes. The sentiments of the Quintii, both Cincinnatus\r\nand Capitolinus, were averse to bloodshed, and to violating (persons)\r\nwhom by the treaty concluded with the commons they had admitted to be\r\nsacred and inviolable. Through these meetings the matter was brought to\r\nthis, that they suffered tribunes of the soldiers with consular\r\nauthority to be elected from the patricians and commons without\r\ndistinction; that with respect to the election of consuls no change\r\nshould be made; and with this the tribunes were content, as were also\r\nthe commons. An assembly is now proclaimed for electing three tribunes\r\nwith consular power. This being proclaimed, forthwith whoever had\r\ncontributed to promote sedition by word or deed, more particularly men\r\nwho had been tribunes, began to solicit support and to bustle about the\r\nforum as candidates; so that despair, in the first instance, of\r\nobtaining the honour, by reason of the irritated state of the people's\r\nmind, then indignation at having to hold the office with such persons,\r\ndeterred the patricians; at length however, being forced, they stood as\r\ncandidates, lest they might appear to have relinquished all share in the\r\ngovernment. The result of this election showed that the sentiments of\r\npersons in the struggle for liberty and dignity are different from those\r\nthey feel when the contest is laid aside, the judgment being unbiassed;\r\nfor the people elected all patricians as tribunes, content with this,\r\nthat the plebeians had been taken into account. Where could you now find\r\nin an individual such moderation, disinterestedness, and elevation of\r\nmind, as was then displayed by the entire people?\r\n\r\n7. In the three hundred and tenth year after the city of Rome was built,\r\nfor the first time military tribunes in the room of consuls enter into\r\noffice, Aulus Sempronius Atratinus, Lucius Atilius, Titus Clælius; in\r\nwhose office the concord prevailing at home afforded peace also abroad.\r\nThere are some who, without mentioning the proposal of the law\r\nconcerning the election of consuls from among the commons, say that\r\nthree military tribunes were elected on account of the Veientian war\r\nbeing added to the war of the Æquans and the Volscians and to the revolt\r\nof the Ardeates, because two consuls could not execute so many wars\r\ntogether, these tribunes being invested also with the authority and\r\ninsignia of consuls. The jurisdiction of that office however did not\r\nstand on a firm footing, because the third month after they entered on\r\nthe office, they resigned the honour, in pursuance of a decree of the\r\naugurs, as if unduly elected; because Caius Curtius, who had presided at\r\nthe election, had not selected his tent with due regard to ceremony.\r\nAmbassadors came to Rome from Ardea complaining of the injustice in such\r\na manner, that it appeared that, if it were redressed, they would\r\ncontinue in amity and the observance of the treaty, on the restitution\r\nof their land. The answer returned by the senate was: \"that the judgment\r\nof the people could not be rescinded by the senate, besides such a\r\nmeasure could not be adopted on precedent or with justice;, as an\r\nadditional reason also for the purpose of preserving concord between the\r\nseveral orders of the state. If the Ardeans were willing to abide a\r\nseasonable conjuncture, and leave to the senate the mode of redressing\r\nthe injustice done to them, that the consequence would be that they\r\nwould rejoice for having moderated their resentment, and that they\r\nshould be convinced that the patricians were equally anxious that no\r\ninjustice should arise against them, and that any which may have arisen\r\nshould not be lasting.\" Thus the ambassadors, saying that they should\r\nlay the whole matter anew before their friends, were dismissed\r\ncourteously. The patricians, now that the republic was without any\r\ncurule magistrate, assembled together and elected an interrex. The\r\ncontest whether consuls or military tribunes should be elected, kept the\r\nmatter for several days in a state of interregnum. The interrex and\r\nsenate strive that the elections of consuls be held; the tribunes of the\r\npeople, and the people themselves, that elections of the military\r\ntribunes be held. The patricians succeeded, because both the commons,\r\nsure to confer the one or the other honour on patricians, gave up a\r\nneedless contest, and the leaders of the commons preferred those\r\nelections at which no account was to be taken of them (as candidates) to\r\nthose at which they should be passed by as unworthy. The tribunes of the\r\ncommons also gave up the contest without a decision, as a compliment to\r\nthe chiefs of the patricians. Titus Quintius Barbatus, the interrex,\r\nelects consuls Lucius Papirius Mugillanus, Lucius Sempronius Atratinus.\r\nDuring their consulship, the treaty was renewed with the Ardeans; and\r\nthat is a record to prove, that they were consuls in that year, though\r\nthey are not to be found among the ancient annals, nor in the books of\r\nthe magistrates. I suppose because military tribunes existed at the\r\ncommencement of the year, on that account, though these consuls were\r\nsubstituted, the names of the consuls were left out, just as if the\r\nmilitary tribunes were the entire year in office. Licinius Macer states,\r\nthat they were found both in the Ardean treaty and in the linen books at\r\nthe temple of Moneta. There was tranquillity both at home and abroad,\r\nthough so many alarms were held out by the neighbouring states.\r\n\r\n8. This year (whether it had tribunes only, or consuls substituted in\r\nthe room of tribunes) is followed by a year when there were undoubtedly\r\nconsuls, scil. Marcus Geganius Macerinus a second time, Titus Quintius\r\nCapitolinus a fifth time. This same year was the commencement of the\r\ncensorship, a thing which arose from an humble origin, which afterwards\r\nincreased so much in importance, that in it was vested the regulation of\r\nthe morals and discipline of Rome, the senate and the centuries of the\r\nknights, the distinction of honour and of ignominy were under the sway\r\nof that office, the legal right to public and private places, the\r\nrevenues of the Roman people fell under their beck and jurisdiction. The\r\ninstitution of the thing originated in this, that the people not having\r\nbeen subjected to a survey for several years, the census could neither\r\nbe deferred, nor had the consuls leisure to discharge their duty, when\r\nwars impended from so many states. An observation was made by the\r\nsenate, \"that an office laborious in itself, and one little suited to\r\nthe consular office, required a magistrate for itself, to whose\r\nauthority should be submitted the duties of the several scribes, the\r\ncustody and care of the records, as well as the adjustment of the form\r\nto be adopted in the census.\" And inconsiderable though the proposal\r\nmight be, still the senate received it with great pleasure, because it\r\nincreased the number of patrician magistrates in the state, judging also\r\nthat that would come to pass, which really did occur, viz. that the\r\ninfluence of those who should preside, and the honour of the office\r\nwould derive on it additional authority and dignity. The tribunes also,\r\nconsidering the discharge of the duty (as was really the case) as\r\nnecessary rather than the duty itself, as being attended with lustre,\r\ndid not indeed offer opposition, lest they should through perverseness\r\nshow a disposition to thwart them even in trifles. After the honour was\r\nrejected by the leading men of the state, the people by their suffrages\r\nappointed to the office of conducting the census Papirius and\r\nSempronius, concerning whose consulate doubts are entertained, that in\r\nthat magistracy they might have some recompence for the incompleteness\r\nof their consulate. They were called censors from the nature of their\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n9. Whilst these matters are transacting at Rome, ambassadors come from\r\nArdea, imploring aid for their city, which was nearly destroyed, in\r\nconsideration of their very ancient alliance, and of the treaty recently\r\nrenewed. For by intestine wars they were not allowed to enjoy the peace\r\nwith Rome, which they had by the soundest policy preserved; the cause\r\nand origin of which is said to have arisen from a struggle between\r\nfactions; which have proved and ever will prove more a cause of\r\ndestruction to several states, than foreign wars, famine, or disease, or\r\nany of the other evils which men refer to the anger of heaven, as the\r\nseverest of public calamities. Two young men courted a maiden of a\r\nplebeian family, highly distinguished for beauty: one of them on a level\r\nwith the maid in point of birth, and favoured by her guardians, who were\r\nthemselves of the same rank; the other of noble birth, captivated by\r\nnothing but her beauty. The latter was aided by the good wishes of the\r\nnobles, through which party disputes made their way even into the girl's\r\nfamily. The nobleman was preferred in the judgment of the mother, who\r\nwas anxious that her daughter should have the most splendid match\r\npossible: the guardians, mindful of party even in that transaction,\r\nstrove for the person of their own order. As the matter could not be\r\nsettled within the walls of the house, they proceeded to a court of\r\njustice. On hearing the claim of the mother and of the guardians, the\r\nmagistrate decides the right of marriage in conformity with the wish of\r\nthe mother. But violence was the more powerful. For the guardians,\r\nhaving harangued openly in the forum among persons of their own faction,\r\non the injustice of the decree, collected a party and carry off the girl\r\nfrom her mother's house: against whom a body of nobles having arisen\r\nmore incensed than before, attends the young man rendered furious by the\r\noutrage. A desperate battle takes place; the commons in no respect like\r\nto the Roman commons were worsted, and having set out from the city in\r\narms, and taken possession of a hill, make excursions into the lands of\r\nthe nobles with fire and sword. The city too, which had been previously\r\nfree from all contest, they set about besieging, having induced, by the\r\nhope of plunder, a multitude of artisans to join them: nor was any\r\nappearance or calamity of war absent; as if the whole state were\r\ninfested by the mad rage of the two young men, who sought the\r\naccomplishment of the fatal match through their country's ruin. The arms\r\nand war at home seemed insufficient to both parties. The nobles called\r\nin the Romans to the relief of their besieged city; the commons called\r\nupon the Volscians to join them in storming Ardea. The Volscians, under\r\nthe command of Clælius, an Æquan, came first to Ardea, and drew a line\r\nof circumvallation around the enemy's walls. When news of this was\r\nbrought to Rome, Marcus Geganius, the consul, having set out immediately\r\nat the head of an army, selected a place for his camp about three miles\r\nfrom the enemy; and the day being now fast declining, he orders his\r\nsoldiers to refresh themselves; then at the fourth watch he puts his\r\ntroops in motion; and the work, once commenced, was expedited in such a\r\nmanner, that at sun-rise the Volscians found themselves enclosed by the\r\nRomans with stronger works than the city was by themselves. The consul\r\nhad also at another place connected an arm to the wall of Ardea, through\r\nwhich his friends might pass to and from the town.\r\n\r\n10. The Volscian general, who up to that period had maintained his army,\r\nnot out of provisions which had been previously provided, but with corn\r\nbrought in daily from the plunder of the country, when now encompassed\r\nby a rampart he perceives himself suddenly destitute of every thing,\r\ncalling the consul to a conference, says, that \"if the Roman came for\r\nthe purpose of raising the siege, he would withdraw the Volscians from\r\nthence.\" To this the consul made answer, that \"the vanquished had to\r\naccept terms, not to dictate them; and as the Volscians came at their\r\nown discretion to attack the allies of the Roman people, they should not\r\ngo off in the same same way.\" He orders, \"that their general be given\r\nup, their arms laid down, acknowledging themselves vanquished, and ready\r\nto submit to his further orders: otherwise, whether they went away or\r\nstayed, that he would prove a determined enemy, and would prefer to\r\ncarry to Rome a victory over the Volscians than an insidious peace.\"\r\nThe Volscians, determined on trying the slender hope they had in arms,\r\nall other being now cut off, besides many other disadvantages, having\r\ncome to an engagement in a place unfavourable for fighting, and still\r\nmore so for retreat, when they were being cut down on every side, from\r\nfighting have recourse to entreaties; having given up their general and\r\nsurrendered their arms, they are sent under the yoke and dismissed full\r\nof disgrace and suffering, with one garment each. And when they halted\r\nnot far from the city of Tusculum, in consequence of an old grudge of\r\nthe Tusculans they were surprised, unarmed as they were, and suffered\r\nsevere punishment, a messenger being scarcely left to bring an account\r\nof their defeat. The Roman general quieted the disturbed state of\r\naffairs at Ardea, beheading the principal authors of that commotion, and\r\nconfiscating their effects to the public treasury of the Ardeans; the\r\nArdeans considered the injustice of the decision completely repaired by\r\nsuch kindness on the part of the Roman people; it seemed to the senate,\r\nhowever, that something remained to be done to obliterate the\r\nremembrance of public avarice. The consul returns to the city in\r\ntriumph, Clælius, the general of the Volscians, being led before his\r\nchariot, and the spoils being carried before him, of which he had\r\nstripped the enemy's army after he had sent them under the yoke.\r\nQuintius the consul, by his civil administration, equalled, which is no\r\neasy matter, the glory attained by his colleague in war; for he so\r\nregulated the domestic care of harmony and peace, by dispensing justice\r\nwith moderation to the highest and the lowest, that both the patricians\r\nconsidered him a strict consul, and the commons, as one sufficiently\r\nlenient. Against the tribunes too he carried his measures more by his\r\ninfluence than by striving against them. Five consulships conducted with\r\nthe same even tenor of conduct, and every part of his life being passed\r\nin a manner worthy of the consular dignity, rendered himself almost more\r\nvenerable than the high office itself. On this account no mention was\r\nmade of the military tribunes during this consulate.\r\n\r\n11. They appoint as consuls Marcus Fabius Vibulanus, Publius Æbutius\r\nCornicen. Fabius and Æbutius, the consuls, inasmuch as they perceived\r\nthat they succeeded to a greater glory of achievements performed at home\r\nand abroad, (the year was rendered particularly remarkable among the\r\nneighbouring states, both friendly and hostile, because relief had been\r\nafforded to the Ardeans in their perilous situation with so much zeal,)\r\nthe more strenuously exerted themselves in obtaining a decree of the\r\nsenate, that they might completely efface the infamy of the decision\r\nfrom the memory of men, to the effect that since the state of the\r\nArdeans had been reduced to a few by intestine war, a colony should be\r\nsent thither as a protection against the Volscians. This is what was\r\nstated publicly on the tables, that the intention entertained of\r\nrescinding the decision might escape the knowledge of the commons and\r\ntribunes. But they had agreed that, a much greater number of Rutulian\r\ncolonists being enrolled than of Romans, no land should be distributed,\r\nexcept that which had been intercepted by the infamous decision; and\r\nthat not a sod of it should be assigned to any Roman, until all the\r\nRutulians had had their share. In this way the land returned to the\r\nArdeans. The commissioners appointed to transplant the colony to Ardea\r\nwere Agrippa Menenius, Titus Clælius Siculus, and Marcus Æbutius Elva.\r\nWhen they, in the discharge of their by no means popular office, had\r\ngiven offence to the commons by assigning to the allies the land which\r\nthe Roman people had decided to be their own, and were not even much\r\nsupported by the patricians, because they had not deferred in any way to\r\nthe influence of any one, a day having been appointed for them by the\r\ntribunes to appear before the people, they escaped all vexatious\r\nannoyance by enrolling themselves as settlers and remaining in the\r\ncolony, which they now had as a testimony of their integrity and\r\njustice.\r\n\r\n12. There was peace at home and abroad both this and the following year,\r\nCaius Furius Pacilus and Marcus Papirius Crassus being consuls. The\r\ngames which had been vowed by the decemvirs, in pursuance of a decree of\r\nthe senate on occasion of the secession of the commons from the\r\npatricians, were performed this year. An occasion for sedition was\r\nsought in vain by Pætelius, who, having been made a tribune of the\r\ncommons a second time, by denouncing these same threats, could neither\r\nprevail on the consuls to submit to the senate the questions concerning\r\nthe division of the lands among the people; and when, after a hard\r\nstruggle, he had succeeded so far that the patricians should be\r\nconsulted as to whether it was their pleasure that an election should be\r\nheld of consuls or of tribunes, consuls were ordered to be elected; and\r\nthe menaces of the tribune were now laughed at, when he threatened that\r\nhe would stop the levy, inasmuch as the neighbouring states being now\r\nquiet, there was no occasion either for war or for preparations for war.\r\nThis tranquil state of things is followed by a year, in which Proculus\r\nGeganius Macerinus, Lucius Menenius Lanatus were consuls, remarkable for\r\na variety of disasters and dangers, also for disturbances, famine, for\r\ntheir having almost submitted their necks to the yoke of arbitrary power\r\nthrough the allurement of largesses. Foreign war alone was wanting, by\r\nwhich if matters had been aggravated, they could scarcely have stood out\r\nagainst them by the aid of all the gods. Their misfortunes began with\r\nfamine; whether it was that the season was unfavourable to the crops, or\r\nthat the cultivation of the land was relinquished for the allurements of\r\nthe city, and of public harangues; for both causes are assigned. And the\r\npatricians accused the commons as being idle; the tribunes of the\r\ncommons complained sometimes of the fraud, at other times of the\r\nnegligence of the consuls. At length the commons prevailed, without\r\nopposition on the part of the senate, that Lucius Minutius should be\r\nappointed president of the market; doomed to be more successful in that\r\noffice in preserving liberty than in the discharge of his own peculiar\r\nprovince: although in the end he bore away the well-earned gratitude of\r\nthe people as well as the glory of having lowered the price of\r\nprovisions. When he had made but slight advance in relieving the markets\r\nby sending embassies around the neighbouring states by land and sea to\r\nno purpose, except that an inconsiderable quantity of corn was imported\r\nfrom Etruria, and applying himself to the careful dispensations of their\r\nscanty stock, by obliging persons to show their supply, and to sell\r\nwhatever was over and above a month's provision, and by depriving the\r\nslaves of one half of their daily allowance; then by censuring and\r\nholding up to the resentment of the people the corn-hoarders, he rather\r\ndiscovered the great scarcity of grain than relieved it by this rigorous\r\ninquisition. Many of the commons, all hope being lost, rather than be\r\ntortured by dragging out existence, muffled up their heads and\r\nprecipitated themselves into the Tiber.\r\n\r\n13. Then Spurius Mælius, of the equestrian order, extremely rich\r\nconsidering these times, set about a project useful in itself, but\r\nhaving a most pernicious tendency, and a still more pernicious motive.\r\nFor having, by the assistance of his friends and clients, bought up corn\r\nfrom Etruria at his private expense, (which very circumstance, I think,\r\nhad been an impediment in the endeavour to reduce the price of corn by\r\nthe exertions of the state,) he set about giving out largesses of corn:\r\nand having won over the commons by this munificence, he drew them with\r\nhim wherever he went, conspicuous and consequential beyond the rank of a\r\nprivate citizen, insuring to him as undoubted the consulship by the\r\nfavour (they manifested towards him) and the hopes (they excited in\r\nhim.) He himself, as the mind of man is not to be satiated with that\r\nwhich fortune holds out the hope of, began to aspire to things still\r\nhigher, and altogether unwarrantable; and since even the consulship\r\nwould have to be taken from the patricians against their will, he began\r\nto set his mind on kingly power;--that that would be the only prize\r\nworthy of such grand designs and of the struggle which would have to be\r\nendured. The consular elections were now coming on, which circumstance\r\ndestroyed him completely, his plans being not yet arranged or\r\nsufficiently matured. Titus Quintius Capitolinus was elected consul for\r\nthe sixth time, a man by no means well suited to answer the views of one\r\nmeditating political innovations: Agrippa Menenius is attached to him as\r\ncolleague, who bore the cognomen of Lanatus: and Lucius Minutius as\r\npresident of the markets, whether he was re-elected, or created for an\r\nindefinite period, as long as circumstances should require; for there is\r\nnothing certain in the matter, except this, his name was entered as\r\npresident in the linen books among the magistrates for both years. Here\r\nMinucius, conducting the same office in a public capacity which Mælius\r\nhad undertaken to conduct in a private character, the same class of\r\npersons frequenting the houses of both, having ascertained the matter,\r\nlays it before the senate, \"that arms were collecting in the house of\r\nMælius, and that he held assemblies in his house: and that his designs\r\nwere unquestionably bent on regal dominion: that the time for the\r\nexecution of the project was not yet fixed: that all other matters were\r\nsettled; and that the tribunes were bought over for hire to betray the\r\npublic liberty, and that the several parts were assigned to the leaders\r\nof the multitude. That he laid these things before them almost later\r\nthan was consistent with safety, lest he might be the reporter of any\r\nthing uncertain or ill-grounded.\" When these things were heard, the\r\nchiefs of the patricians both rebuked the consuls of the former year,\r\nfor having suffered those largesses and meetings of the people to go on\r\nin a private house, as well as the new consuls for having waited until a\r\nmatter of such importance should be reported to the senate by the\r\npresident of the markets, which required the consul to be not only the\r\nreporter, but the punisher also; then Titus Quintius said, \"that the\r\nconsuls were unfairly censured, who being fettered by the laws\r\nconcerning appeal, enacted to weaken their authority, by no means\r\npossessed as much power in their office as will, to punish that\r\nproceeding according to its atrocity. That there was wanting a man not\r\nonly determined in himself, but one who was unshackled and freed from\r\nthe fetters of those laws. That he would therefore appoint Lucius\r\nQuintius dictator; that in him there would be a determination suitable\r\nto so great a power.\" Whilst all approved, Quintius at first refused;\r\nand asked them what they meant, in exposing him in the extremity of age\r\nto such a contest. Then when they all said that in that aged mind there\r\nwas not only more wisdom, but more energy also, than in all the rest,\r\nand went on loading him with deserved praises, whilst the consul relaxed\r\nnot in his original determination; Cincinnatus at length having prayed\r\nto the immortal gods, that his old age might not prove a detriment or\r\ndisgrace to the republic at so dangerous a juncture, is appointed\r\ndictator by the consul: he himself then appoints Caius Servilius Ahala\r\nhis master of the horse.\r\n\r\n14. On the next day, having stationed proper guards, when he had gone\r\ndown to the forum, and the attention of the commons was attracted to him\r\nby the strangeness and extraordinary nature of the thing, and Mælius's\r\nfriends and himself their leader perceived that the power of such high\r\nauthority was directly aimed at them; when, moreover, those who were not\r\naware of the designs on regal power, went on asking, \"what tumult, what\r\nsudden war, had called for either the dictatorial authority, or\r\nQuintius, after his eightieth year, administrator of affairs,\"\r\nServilius, master of the horse, being sent by the dictator to Mælius,\r\nsays, \"The dictator summons you.\" When he, being alarmed, asked what he\r\nmeant, and Servilius stated that \"he must stand a trial,\" and answer the\r\ncharge brought against him before the senate by Minucius, Mælius drew\r\nback into the band of his adherents, and at first, looking around him,\r\nhe began to skulk off: at length when the beadle, by order of the master\r\nof the horse, was bringing him off, being rescued by those present, and\r\nrunning away, he implored the protection of the Roman people, and\r\nalleged that he was persecuted by a conspiracy of the patricians because\r\nhe had acted kindly towards the people: he besought them that they would\r\nassist him in this critical emergency, and not suffer him to be\r\nbutchered before their eyes. Ahala Servilius overtook and slew him\r\nwhilst exclaiming in this manner; and smeared with the blood of the\r\nperson so slain, and surrounded by a body of young nobles, he carries\r\nback word to the dictator that Mælius having been summoned to him, and\r\ncommencing to excite the multitude after he had repulsed the beadle, had\r\nreceived condign punishment. \"Thou hast acted nobly, Caius Servilius,\"\r\nsaid the dictator, \"in having saved the republic.\"\r\n\r\n15. He then ordered the multitude, who were much agitated, not knowing\r\nwhat judgment to form of the deed, to be called to an assembly: and he\r\nopenly declared, \"that Mælius had been justly put to death, even though\r\nhe may have been innocent of the charge of aiming at regal power, who,\r\nwhen summoned to attend the dictator by the master of the horse, had not\r\ncome. That he himself had taken his seat to examine into the case; that,\r\nafter it had been investigated, Mælius should have met a result\r\ncorresponding to his deserts; that when employing force, in order that\r\nhe might not commit himself to a trial, he had been checked by force.\r\nNor should they proceed with him as with a citizen, who, born in a free\r\nstate amid laws and rights, in a city from which he knew that kings had\r\nbeen expelled, and on the same year the sons of the king's sister and\r\nthe children of the consul, the liberator of his country, had been put\r\nto death by their father, on a plot for readmitting the royal family\r\ninto the city having been discovered, from which Collatinus Tarquinius\r\nthe consul, through a hatred of his name, was ordered to resign his\r\noffice and go into exile; in which capital punishment was inflicted on\r\nSpurius Cassius several years after for forming designs to assume the\r\nsovereignty; in which the decemvirs were recently punished with\r\nconfiscation, exile, and death, in consequence of regal tyranny in that\r\ncity, Spurius Mælius conceived a hope of attaining regal power. And who\r\nwas this man? Although no nobility, no honours, no deserts should open\r\nto any man the road to domination, yet still the Claudii and Cassii, by\r\nreason of the consulates, the decemvirates, the honours of their own and\r\nthose of their ancestors, and from the splendour of their families, had\r\nraised their aspiring minds to heights to which it was impious to raise\r\nthem: that Spurius Mælius, to whom a tribuneship of the commons should\r\nrather be an object of wishes than of hope, a wealthy corn-merchant, had\r\nconceived the hope to purchase the liberty of his countrymen for two\r\npounds of corn; had supposed that a people victorious over all their\r\nneighbours could be cajoled into servitude by throwing them a morsel of\r\nfood; so that a person whom the state could scarcely digest as a\r\nsenator, it should tolerate as king, possessing the ensigns and\r\nauthority of Romulus their founder, who had descended from and had\r\nreturned to the gods. This was to be considered not more criminal than\r\nit was monstrous: nor was it sufficiently expiated by his blood; unless\r\nthe roof and walls within which so mad a project had been conceived,\r\nshould be levelled to the ground, and his effects were confiscated, as\r\nbeing contaminated with the price of purchasing kingly domination. He\r\nordered, therefore, that the quæstors should sell this property and\r\ndeposit the proceeds in the treasury.\"\r\n\r\n16. He then ordered his house to be immediately razed, that the vacant\r\nground might serve as a monument of nefarious hopes destroyed. This was\r\ncalled Æquimælium. Lucius Minucius was presented with a gilded ox on the\r\noutside of the gate Trigemina, and this not even against the will of the\r\ncommons, because he distributed Mælius's corn, after valuing it at one\r\n_as_ per bushel. In some writers I find that this Minucius had changed\r\nsides from the patricians to the commons, and that having been chosen as\r\neleventh tribune of the people, he quieted a commotion which arose on\r\nthe death of Mælius. But it is scarcely credible that the patricians\r\nwould have suffered the number of the tribunes to be increased, and that\r\nsuch a precedent should be introduced more particularly in the case of a\r\nman who was a patrician; or that the commons did not afterwards\r\nmaintain, or at least attempt, that privilege once conceded to them. But\r\nthe legal provision made a few years before, viz. that it should not be\r\nlawful for the tribunes to choose a colleague, refutes beyond every\r\nthing else the false inscription on the statue. Quintus Cæcilius,\r\nQuintus Junius, Sextus Titinius, were the only members of the college of\r\ntribunes who had not been concerned in passing the law for conferring\r\nhonours on Minucius; nor did they cease both to throw out censures one\r\ntime on Minucius, at another time on Servilius, before the commons, and\r\nto complain of the unmerited death of Mælius. They succeeded, therefore,\r\nin having an election held for military tribunes rather than for\r\nconsuls, not doubting but that in six places, for so many were now\r\nallowed to be elected, some plebeians also might be appointed, by their\r\nprofessing to be avengers of the death of Mælius. The commons, though\r\nthey had been agitated that year by many and various commotions, neither\r\nelected more than three tribunes with consular power; and among them\r\nLucius Quintius, son of Cincinnatus, from the unpopular nature of whose\r\ndictatorship an occasion for disturbance was sought. Mamercus Æmilius, a\r\nman of the highest dignity, was voted in, prior to Quintius. In the\r\nthird place they appoint Lucius Julius.\r\n\r\n17. During their office Fidenæ, a Roman colony, revolted to Lars\r\nTolunmius, king of the Veientians, and to the Veientians. To the revolt\r\na more heinous crime was added. By order of Tolumnius they put to death\r\nCaius Fulcinius, Clælius Tullus, Spurius Antius, Lucius Roscius, Roman\r\nambassadors, who came to inquire into the reason of this new line of\r\nconduct. Some palliate the guilt of the king; that an ambiguous\r\nexpression of his, during a lucky throw of dice, having been mistaken by\r\nthe Fidenatians, as if it seemed to be an order for their execution, had\r\nbeen the cause of the ambassadors' death. An incredible tale; that his\r\nthoughts should not have been drawn away from the game on the arrival of\r\nthe Fidenatians, his new allies, when consulting him on a murder tending\r\nto violate the law of nations; and that the act was not afterwards\r\nviewed by him with horror. It is more probable that he wished the state\r\nof the Fidenatians to be so compromised by their participation in so\r\ngreat a crime, that they might not afterwards look to any hope from the\r\nRomans. Statues of the ambassadors, who were slain at Fidenæ, were set\r\nup in the rostra at the public expense. A desperate struggle was coming\r\non with the Veientians and Fidenatians, who, besides that they were\r\nneighbouring states, had commenced the war with so heinous a\r\nprovocation. Therefore, the commons and their tribunes being now quiet,\r\nso as to attend to the general welfare, there was no dispute with\r\nrespect to the electing of Marcus Geganius Macerinus a third time, and\r\nLucius Sergius Fidenas, as consuls; so called, I suppose, from the war\r\nwhich he afterwards conducted. For he was the first who fought a\r\nsuccessful battle with the king of the Veientians on this side of the\r\nAnio, nor did he obtain an unbloody victory. Greater grief was therefore\r\nfelt from the loss of their countrymen, than joy from the defeat of the\r\nenemy: and the senate, as in an alarming crisis, ordered Mamercus\r\nÆmilius to be appointed dictator. He appointed as his master of the\r\nhorse from the college of the preceding year, in which there had been\r\ntribunes of the soldiers with consular power, Lucius Quintius\r\nCincinnatus, a youth worthy of his parent. To the levy held by the\r\nconsuls were added the old centurions well versed in war, and the number\r\nof those lost in the late battle was made up. The dictator ordered\r\nLucius Quintius Capitolinus and Marcus Fabius Vibulanus to attend him as\r\nhis lieutenants-general. Both the higher powers, and the man suitable to\r\nsuch powers, caused the enemy to move from the Roman territory to the\r\nother side of the Anio, and continuing their retrograde movement, they\r\ntook possession of the hills between Fidenæ and the Anio, nor did they\r\ndescend into the plains until the troops of the Faliscians came to their\r\naid; then at length the camp of the Etrurians was pitched before the\r\nwalls of Fidenæ. The Roman dictator took his post at no great distance\r\nfrom thence at the conflux on the banks of both rivers, lines being run\r\nacross between them, as far as he was able to follow by a fortification.\r\nNext day he marched out his army into the field.\r\n\r\n18. Among the enemy there was a diversity of opinion. The Faliscians,\r\nimpatient of the hardships of war at a distance from home, and\r\nsufficiently confident of their own strength, earnestly demanded\r\nbattle; the Veientians and Fidenatians placed more hope in protracting\r\nthe war. Tolumnius, though the measures of his own subjects were more\r\nagreeable to him, proclaims that he would give battle on the following\r\nday, lest the Faliscians might not brook the service at so great a\r\ndistance from their home. The dictator and the Romans took additional\r\ncourage from the fact of the enemy having declined giving battle: and on\r\nthe following day, the soldiers exclaiming that they would attack the\r\ncamp and the city, if an opportunity of fighting were not afforded them,\r\nthe armies advance on both sides into the middle of a plain between the\r\ntwo camps. The Veientians, having the advantage in numbers, sent around\r\na party behind the mountains to attack the Roman camp during the heat of\r\nthe battle. The army of the three states stood drawn up in such a\r\nmanner, that the Veientians occupied the right wing, the Faliscians the\r\nleft, whilst the Fidenatians constituted the centre. The dictator\r\ncharged on the right wing against the Faliscians, Quintius Capitolinus\r\non the left against the Veientians, and the master of the horse with the\r\ncavalry advanced in the centre. For a short time all was silence and\r\nquiet, the Etrurians being determined not to engage unless they were\r\ncompelled, and the dictator looking back towards a Roman fort, until a\r\nsignal should be raised, as had been agreed on, by the augurs, as soon\r\nas the birds had given a favourable omen. As soon as he perceived this,\r\nhe orders the cavalry first to charge the enemy, after raising a loud\r\nshout; the line of infantry following, engaged with great fury. In no\r\nquarter did the Etrurian legions withstand the shock of the Romans. The\r\ncavalry made the greatest resistance; and the king himself, far the\r\nbravest of the cavalry, charging the Romans whilst they were pursuing in\r\ndisorder in every direction, prolonged the contest.\r\n\r\n19. There was then among the cavalry, Aulus Cornelius Cossus, a tribune\r\nof the soldiers, distinguished for the beauty of his person, and equally\r\nso for courage and great strength of body, and mindful of his rank,\r\nwhich, having received in a state of the highest lustre, he left to his\r\nposterity still greater and more distinguished. He perceiving that the\r\nRoman troops gave way at the approach of Tolumnius, wherever he directed\r\nhis charge, and knowing him as being remarkable by his royal apparel, as\r\nhe flew through the entire line, exclaims, \"Is this the infringer of\r\nhuman treaties and the violator of the law of nations? This victim I\r\nshall now slay, (provided the gods wish that there should be any thing\r\nsacred on earth,) and shall offer him up to the manes of the\r\nambassadors.\" Having clapped spurs to his horse, he advances against\r\nthis single foe with spear presented; and after having struck and\r\nunhorsed him, he immediately, by help of his lance, sprung on the\r\nground. And as the king attempted to rise, he throws him back again with\r\nthe boss of his shield, and with repeated thrusts pins him to the earth.\r\nHe then stripped off the spoils from the lifeless body; and having cut\r\noff his head and carrying it on the point of his spear, he puts the\r\nenemy to rout through terror on seeing their king slain. Thus the line\r\nof cavalry, which alone had rendered the combat doubtful, was beaten.\r\nThe dictator pursues closely the routed legions, and drove them to their\r\ncamp with slaughter. The greater number of the Fidenatians, through\r\ntheir knowledge of the country, made their escape to the mountains.\r\nCossus, having crossed the Tiber with the cavalry, carried off great\r\nplunder from the Veientian territory to the city. During the battle\r\nthere was a fight also at the Roman camp against a party of the forces,\r\nwhich, as has been already mentioned, had been sent by Tolumnius to the\r\ncamp. Fabius Vibulanus first defends his lines by a ring; then, whilst\r\nthe enemy were wholly taken up with the entrenchment, sallying out from\r\nthe principal gate on the right, he suddenly attacks them with the\r\ntriarii: and a panic being thus struck into them there was less\r\nslaughter, because they were fewer, but their flight was no less\r\ndisorderly than it had been on the field of battle.\r\n\r\n20. Matters being managed successfully in every direction, the dictator,\r\nby a decree of the senate and order of the people, returned to the city\r\nin triumph. By far the most remarkable object in the triumph was Cossus,\r\nbearing the _spolia opima_ of the king he had slain. The soldiers\r\nchaunted their uncouth verses on him, extolling him as equal to Romulus.\r\nWith the usual form of dedication, he presented, as an offering, the\r\nspoils in the temple of Jupiter Feretrius, near the spoils of Romulus,\r\nwhich, having been the first called _opima_, were the only ones at that\r\ntime; and he attracted the eyes of all the citizens from the dictator's\r\nchariot to himself, and enjoyed almost solely the honour of that day's\r\nsolemnity. The dictator offered up to Jupiter in the Capitol a golden\r\ncrown a pound in weight, at the public expense, by order of the people.\r\nFollowing all the Roman writers, I have represented Aulus Cornelius\r\nCossus as a military tribune, when he carried the second _spolia opima_\r\nto the temple of Jupiter Feretrius. But besides that those spoils are\r\nrightly considered _opima_, which one general has taken from another;\r\nand we know no general but the person under whose auspices the war is\r\nconducted, the inscription itself written on the spoils proves, against\r\nboth me and them, that Cossus was consul when he took them. Having once\r\nheard Augustus Cæsar, the founder or restorer of all our temples, on\r\nentering the temple of Jupiter Feretrius, which being dilapidated by\r\ntime he rebuilt, aver that he himself had read the said inscription on\r\nthe linen breastplate, I thought it would be next to sacrilege to rob\r\nCossus of such a testimony respecting his spoils as that of Cæsar, the\r\nrenovator of the temple itself. Whether the mistake is chargeable on the\r\nvery ancient annals and the linen books of the magistrates, deposited in\r\nthe temple of Moneta, and which Licinius Macer occasionally cites as\r\nauthorities, which have Aulus Cornelius Cossus consul with Titus\r\nQuintius Pennus, in the ninth year after this, every person may form his\r\nown opinion. For there is this additional proof, that a battle so\r\ncelebrated could not be transferred to that year; that the three years\r\nbefore and after the consulship of Aulus Cornelius were entirely free\r\nfrom war, in consequence of a pestilence and a scarcity of grain; so\r\nthat some annals, as if in mourning, present nothing but the names of\r\nthe consuls. The third year from the consulship of Cossus has him as\r\nmilitary tribune with consular power; in the same year as master of the\r\nhorse, in which office he fought another distinguished horse battle.\r\nConjecture is open on the matter; but, as I think, idle surmises may be\r\nturned to support any opinion: when the hero of the fight, having placed\r\nthe recent spoils in the sacred repository, having before him Jove\r\nhimself, to whom they were consecrated, and Romulus, no contemptible\r\nwitnesses in case of a false inscription, entitled himself Aulus\r\nCornelius Cossus consul.\r\n\r\n21. Marcus Cornelius Maluginensis and Lucius Papirius Crassus being\r\nconsuls, the armies were led into the territories of the Veientians and\r\nFaliscians; numbers of men and cattle were driven off as spoil; the\r\nenemy was no where to be found on the land, and no opportunity of\r\nfighting was afforded; the cities however were not attacked, because a\r\npestilential disorder ran through the people. Disturbances were also\r\nsought at home, but not actually excited, however, by Spurius Mælius,\r\ntribune of the people; who thinking that he might create some tumult\r\nthrough the popularity of his name, had both appointed a day of trial\r\nfor Minucius, and had also proposed a law for confiscating the property\r\nof Servilius Ahala: alleging that Mælius had been circumvented through\r\nfalse impeachments by Minucius, charging Servilius with the killing of a\r\ncitizen on whom no sentence had been passed; charges which, when brought\r\nbefore the people, proved to be more idle than the author himself. But\r\nthe virulence of the disease now becoming worse, was more an object of\r\nconcern to them, as also the terrors and prodigies, more especially\r\nbecause accounts were being brought, that houses were falling throughout\r\nthe country, in consequence of frequent earthquakes. A supplication was\r\ntherefore performed by the people, according to the form dictated by the\r\ndecemvirs.[153] The year being still more pestilential, Caius Julius a\r\nsecond time and Lucius Virginius being consuls, occasioned such dread of\r\ndesolation through the city and country, that not only no one left the\r\nRoman territory for the purpose of committing depredations, and not only\r\ndid none of the patricians or commons entertain an idea of commencing\r\nany military aggressions; but the Fidenatians, who at first had shut\r\nthemselves up either within their town, or mountains, or fortifications,\r\nnow descended without provocation to commit depredations on the Roman\r\nterritory. Then the army of the Veientians being called in to their aid,\r\n(for the Faliscians could be induced to renew the war neither by the\r\ndistresses of the Romans, nor by the remonstrances of their allies,) the\r\ntwo states crossed the Anio; and displayed their ensigns at no great\r\ndistance from the Colline gate. Great consternation arose therefore, not\r\nmore in the country than in the city. Julius the consul draws up his\r\ntroops on the rampart and walls; the senate is consulted by Virginius in\r\nthe temple of Quirinus. It is determined that Aulus Servilius be\r\nappointed dictator, who some say had the cognomen of Priscus, others\r\nthat of Structus. Virginius having delayed whilst he consulted his\r\ncolleague, with his permission, named the dictator at night. He appoints\r\nPostumus Æbutius Elva his master of the horse.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 153: In the performance of such rites, the slightest mistake\r\nof a word or syllable was deemed highly inauspicious; to prevent which,\r\nthe regular form of words was pronounced by a priest, and repeated after\r\nhim by the persons officiating.]\r\n\r\n22. The dictator orders all to attend at break of day outside the\r\nColline gate. All whosoever had sufficient strength to bear arms,\r\nattended; the standards were quickly brought forth from the treasury and\r\nconveyed to the dictator. Whilst these matters were going on, the\r\nenemies retired to the higher grounds; thither the dictator follows them\r\nwith a determined army; and having come to a general engagement not far\r\nfrom Nomentum, he routed the Etrurian legions; he then drove them into\r\nthe city of Fidenæ, and surrounded it with a rampart. But neither could\r\nthe city be taken by storm as being high and well fortified, nor was\r\nthere any effect in a blockade, because corn was supplied to them in\r\nabundance not only for necessary consumption, but for plenty also, in\r\nconsequence of that previously laid up. Thus all hope being lost of\r\ntaking it by assault, or of forcing it to a surrender, the dictator\r\ndetermined on carrying a sap into the citadel in places which were well\r\nknown to him on account of their near situation on the remote side of\r\nthe city, as being most neglected because it was best protected by\r\nreason of its own nature; he himself by advancing up to the walls in\r\nplaces most remote, with his army divided into four sections, which were\r\nto succeed each other in the action, by continuing the fight day and\r\nnight continuously he prevented the enemy from perceiving the work;\r\nuntil the mountain being dug through from the camp, a passage was opened\r\nup into the citadel; and the Etrurians being diverted from the real\r\ndanger by the idle threats, the shouting of the enemy over their heads\r\nproved to them that their city was taken. On that year Caius Furius\r\nPacilus and Marcus Geganius Macerinus, censors, approved of the public\r\nedifice[154] in the Campus Martius, and the census of the people was\r\nthere performed for the first time.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 154: _Villa publica_. It was destined to public uses, such as\r\nholding the _census_, or survey of the people, the reception of\r\nambassadors, &c.]\r\n\r\n23. That the same consuls were re-elected on the following year, Julius\r\nfor the third time, Virginius for the second time, I find in Licinius\r\nMacer. Valerius Antias and Quintus Tubero state that Marcus Manlius and\r\nQuintus Sulpicius were, the consuls for that year. But in\r\nrepresentations so different both Tubero and Macer cite the linen books\r\nas their authority; neither of them denies that it was said by ancient\r\nhistorians that there were military tribunes on that year. Licinius\r\nthinks that we should unhesitatingly follow the linen books; and Tubero\r\nis uncertain as to the truth. But this also is left unsettled among\r\nother points not ascertained from length of time. Alarm was raised in\r\nEtruria after the capture of Fidenæ, not only the Veientians being\r\nterrified by the apprehension of similar ruin, but the Faliscians also,\r\nfrom the recollection of the war having first commenced with them,\r\nalthough they had not joined with those who renewed hostilities.\r\nAccordingly when the two nations, having sent ambassadors around to the\r\ntwelve states, succeeded so far that a general meeting was proclaimed\r\nfor all Etruria at the temple of Voltumna; the senate, apprehending a\r\ngreat attack threatening from that quarter, ordered Mamercus Æmilius\r\nagain to be appointed dictator. Aulus Postumius Tubertus was appointed\r\nby him as master of the horse; and preparations for war were made with\r\nso much the more energy than on the last occasion, in proportion as\r\nthere was more danger from the whole body of Etruria than from two of\r\nits states.\r\n\r\n24. That matter passed off much more quietly than any one expected.\r\nTherefore when word was brought by certain traders, that aid was refused\r\nto the Veientians, and that they were bid to prosecute with their own\r\nstrength a war entered into on their own separate views, and not to seek\r\nout persons as sharers in their distresses, to whom they had not\r\ncommunicated their hopes when flourishing; the dictator, that his\r\nappointment might not be in vain, all opportunity of acquiring military\r\nglory being now taken from him, desirous of performing during peace some\r\nwork which might serve as a memorial of his dictatorship, sets about\r\nlimiting the censorship, either judging its powers excessive, or\r\ndisapproving of the duration rather than the extent of the office.\r\nAccordingly, having summoned a meeting, he says \"that the immortal gods\r\nhad taken on themselves that the public affairs should be managed\r\nexternally, and that the general security should be insured; that with\r\nrespect to what was to be done within the walls, he would provide for\r\nthe liberty of the Roman people. But that the most effectual guarding of\r\nit was, that offices of great power should not be of long continuance;\r\nand that a limit of time should be set to those to which a limit of\r\njurisdiction could not be set. That other offices were annual, that the\r\ncensorship was quinquennial; that it was a grievance to be subject to\r\nthe same individuals for such a number of years in a considerable part\r\nof the affairs of life. That he would propose a law, that the censorship\r\nshould not last longer than a year and half.\" Amid the great approbation\r\nof the people he passed the law on the following day, and says, \"that\r\nyou may know, Romans, in reality, how little pleasing to me are offices\r\nof long duration, I resign the dictatorship.\" Having laid down his own\r\noffice, and set a limit to the office of others, he was escorted home\r\nwith the congratulation and great good will of the people. The censors\r\nresenting Mamercus' conduct for his having diminished the duration of\r\none of the offices of the Roman people, degraded him from his tribe, and\r\nincreasing his taxes eight-fold, disfranchised[155] him. They say that\r\nhe bore this with great magnanimity, as he considered the cause of the\r\ndisgrace, rather than the disgrace itself; that the principal patricians\r\nalso, though they had been averse to the curtailing the privileges of\r\nthe censorship, were much displeased at this instance of censorial\r\nseverity; inasmuch as each saw that he would be longer and more\r\nfrequently subjected to the censors, than he should hold the office of\r\ncensor. Certain it is that such indignation is said to have arisen on\r\nthe part of the people, that violence could not be kept off from the\r\ncensors through the influence of any person except of Mamercus himself.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 155: _ærarium facere_, signifies to strip a person of all the\r\nprivileges of a citizen, on which he became _civis ærarius_, a citizen\r\nonly so far as he paid taxes.]\r\n\r\n25. The tribunes of the people, by preventing the election of consuls by\r\nincessant harangues, succeeded at length, after the matter had been well\r\nnigh brought to an interregnum, in having tribunes of the soldiers\r\nelected with consular authority: as for the prize of their victory,\r\nwhich was the thing sought, _scil._ that a plebeian should be elected,\r\nthere was none. All patricians were elected, Marcus Fabius Vibulanus,\r\nMarcus Foslius, Lucius Sergius Fidenas. The pestilence during that year\r\nafforded a quiet in other matters. A temple was vowed to Apollo for the\r\nhealth of the people. The duumvirs did much, by direction of the books,\r\nfor the purpose of appeasing the wrath of heaven and averting the plague\r\nfrom the people; a great mortality however was sustained in the city and\r\ncountry, by the death of men and of cattle promiscuously. Apprehending a\r\nfamine for the agriculturists, they sent into Etruria, and the Pomptine\r\ndistrict, and to Cumæ, and at last to Sicily also to procure corn. No\r\nmention was made of electing consuls. Military tribunes with consular\r\nauthority were appointed, all patricians, Lucius Pinarius Mamercinus,\r\nLucius Furius Medullinus, Spurius Postumius Albus. In this year the\r\nviolence of the distemper abated, nor was there any danger from a\r\nscarcity of corn, because provision had been previously made against it.\r\nSchemes for exciting wars were agitated in the meetings of the Æquans\r\nand Volscians, and in Etruria at the temple of Voltumna. Here the matter\r\nwas postponed for a year, and by a decree it was enacted, that no\r\nmeeting should be held before that time, the Veientian state in vain\r\ncomplaining that the same destiny hung over Veii, as that by which\r\nFidenæ was destroyed. Meanwhile at Rome the chiefs of the commons, who\r\nhad now for a long time been vainly pursuing the hope of higher dignity,\r\nwhilst there was tranquillity abroad, appointed meetings to be held in\r\nthe houses of the tribunes of the commons. There they concerted plans in\r\nsecret: they complained \"that they were so despised by the commons, that\r\nthough tribunes of the soldiers, with consular authority, were now\r\nappointed for so many years, no plebeian ever obtained access to that\r\nhonour. That their ancestors had shown much foresight in providing that\r\nplebeian offices should not be open to any patrician; otherwise they\r\nshould be forced to have patricians as tribunes of the commons; so\r\ndespicable were they even with their own party, and were not less\r\ndespised by the commons than by the patricians.\" Others exculpated the\r\ncommons, and threw the blame on the patricians,--\"that by their\r\nintriguing and schemes it happened that the road to honour was barred\r\nagainst the commons. If the commons were allowed to breathe from their\r\nmixed entreaties and menaces, that they would enter on their suffrages\r\nwith a due regard to men of their own party; and, assistance being\r\nalready procured, that they would assume a share in the government\r\nalso.\" It is determined that, for the purpose of doing away with all\r\nintriguing, the tribunes should propose a law, that no person be allowed\r\nto add white to his garment for the purposes of canvassing. The matter\r\nmay now appear trivial and scarcely deserving serious consideration,\r\nwhich then enkindled such strife between the patricians and commons. The\r\ntribunes, however, prevailed in carrying the law; and it appeared\r\nevident, that in their present state of irritation, the commons would\r\nincline their support to men of their own party; and lest this should be\r\noptional with them, a decree of the senate is passed, that the election\r\nfor consuls should be held.\r\n\r\n26. The cause was the rising, which the Hernicians and Latins announced\r\nas about to take place on the part of the Æquans and Volscians. Titus\r\nQuintius Cincinnatus, son of Lucius, (to the same person the cognomen of\r\nPennus also is annexed,) and Caius Julius Mento were elected consuls:\r\nnor was the terror of war longer deferred. A levy being held under the\r\ndevoting law, which with them is the most powerful instrument of forcing\r\nmen into service, powerful armies set out from thence, and met at\r\nAlgidum; and there the Æquans and Volscians fortified their camps\r\nseparately; and the general took greater care than ever before to\r\nfortify their posts and train their soldiers; so much the more terror\r\ndid the messengers bring to Rome. The senate wished that a dictator\r\nshould be appointed, because though these nations had been often\r\nconquered, yet they renewed hostilities with more vigorous efforts than\r\never before, and a considerable number of the Roman youth had been\r\ncarried off by sickness. Above all, the perverseness of the consuls, and\r\nthe disagreement between them, and their contentions in all the\r\ncouncils, terrified them. There are some who state that an unsuccessful\r\nbattle was fought by these consuls at Algidum, and that such was the\r\ncause of appointing a dictator. This much is certain, that, though\r\ndiffering in other points, they perfectly agreed in one against the\r\nwishes of the patricians, not to nominate a dictator; until when\r\naccounts were brought, one more alarming than another, and the consuls\r\nwould not be swayed by the authority of the senate, Quintus Servilius\r\nPriscus, who had passed through the highest honours with singular\r\nhonour, says, \"Tribunes of the people, since we are come to\r\nextremities, the senate calls on you, that you would, by virtue of your\r\nauthority, compel the consuls to nominate a dictator in so critical a\r\nconjuncture of the state.\" On hearing this, the tribunes, conceiving\r\nthat an opportunity was presented to them of extending their power,\r\nretire together, and declare for their college, that \"it was their wish\r\nthat the consuls should be obedient to the instruction of the senate; if\r\nthey persisted further against the consent of that most illustrious\r\norder, that they would order them to be taken to prison.\" The consuls\r\nwere better pleased to be overcome by the tribunes than by the senate,\r\nalleging that the prerogatives of the highest magistracy were betrayed\r\nby the patricians and the consulship subjugated to tribunitian power,\r\ninasmuch as the consuls were liable to be overruled by a tribune in any\r\nparticular by virtue of his power, and (what greater hardship could a\r\nprivate man have to dread?) even to be carried off to prison. The lot to\r\nnominate the dictator (for the colleagues had not even agreed on that)\r\nfell on Titus Quintius. He appointed a dictator, Aulus Postumius\r\nTubertus, his own father-in-law, a man of the utmost strictness in\r\ncommand: by him Lucius Julius was appointed master of the horse: a\r\nsuspension of civil business is also proclaimed; and, that nothing else\r\nshould be attended to throughout the city but preparations for war, the\r\nexamination of the cases of those who claimed exemption from the\r\nmilitary service is deferred till after the war. Thus even doubtful\r\npersons are induced to give in their names. Soldiers were also enjoined\r\nof the Hernicians and Latins: the most zealous obedience is shown to the\r\ndictator on both sides.\r\n\r\n27. All these measures were executed with great despatch: and Caius\r\nJulius the consul being left to guard the city, and Lucius Julius master\r\nof the horse, for the sudden exigencies of the war, lest any thing which\r\nthey might want in the camp should cause delay, the dictator, repeating\r\nthe words after Aulus Cornelius the chief pontiff, vowed the great games\r\non account of the sudden war; and having set out from the city, after\r\ndividing his army with the consul Quintius, he came up with the enemy.\r\nAs they had observed two separate camps of the enemy at a small distance\r\none from the other, they in like manner encamped separately about a mile\r\nfrom them, the dictator towards Tusculum, the consul towards Lanuvium.\r\nThus they had their four armies, as many fortified posts, having between\r\nthem a plain sufficiently extended not only for excursions to skirmish,\r\nbut even for drawing up the armies on both sides in battle-array. From\r\nthe time camp was brought close to camp, they ceased not from light\r\nskirmishing, the dictator readily allowing his soldiers, by comparing\r\nstrength, to entertain beforehand the hope of a general victory, after\r\nthey had gradually essayed the result of slight skirmishes. Wherefore\r\nthe enemy, no hope being now left in a regular engagement, attacked the\r\nconsuls' camp in the night, and bring the matter to the chance of a\r\ndoubtful result. The shout which arose suddenly awoke not only the\r\nconsuls' sentinels and then all the army, but the dictator also. When\r\ncircumstances required instant exertion, the consul evinced no\r\ndeficiency either in spirit or in judgment. One part of the troops\r\nreinforce the guards at the gates, another man the rampart around. In\r\nthe other camp with the dictator, inasmuch as there is less of\r\nconfusion, so much the more readily is it observed, what is required to\r\nbe done. Despatching then forthwith a reinforcement to the consuls'\r\ncamp, to which Spurius Postumius Albus is appointed lieutenant-general,\r\nhe himself with a part of his forces, making a small circuit, proceeds\r\nto a place entirely sequestered from the bustle, whence he might\r\nsuddenly attack the enemy's rear. Quintus Sulpicius, his\r\nlieutenant-general, he appoints to take charge of the camp; to Marcus\r\nFabius as lieutenant he assigns the cavalry, and orders that those\r\ntroops, which it would be difficult to manage amid a nightly conflict,\r\nshould not stir before day-light. All the measures which any other\r\nprudent and active general could order and execute at such a juncture,\r\nhe orders and executes with regularity; that was an extraordinary\r\nspecimen of judgment and intrepidity, and one deserving of no ordinary\r\npraise, that he despatched Marcus Geganius with some chosen troops to\r\nattack the enemy's camp, whence it had been ascertained that they had\r\ndeparted with the greater part of their troops. When he fell on these\r\nmen, wholly intent on the result of the danger of their friends, and\r\nincautious with respect to themselves, the watches and advanced guards\r\nbeing even neglected, he took their camp almost before the enemy were\r\nperfectly sure that it was attacked. Then when the signal given with\r\nsmoke, as had been agreed on, was perceived by the dictator, he\r\nexclaims that the enemy's camp was taken, and orders it to be announced\r\nin every direction.\r\n\r\n28. And now day was appearing, and every thing lay open to view; and\r\nFabius had made an attack with his cavalry, and the consul had sallied\r\nfrom the camp on the enemy now disconcerted; when the dictator on the\r\nother side, having attacked their reserve and second line, threw his\r\nvictorious troops, both horse and foot, in the way of the enemy as they\r\nturned themselves about to the dissonant shouts and the various sudden\r\nassaults. Thus surrounded on every side, they would to a man have\r\nsuffered the punishment due to their reassumption of hostilities, had\r\nnot Vectius Messius, a Volscian, a man more ennobled by his deeds than\r\nhis extraction, upbraiding his men as they were forming a circle, called\r\nout with a loud voice, \"Are ye about offering yourselves here to the\r\nweapons of the enemy, undefended, unavenged? why is it then ye have\r\narms? or why have you undertaken an offensive war, ever turbulent in\r\npeace, and dastardly in war? What hopes have you in standing here? do\r\nyou expect that some god will protect you and bear you hence? With the\r\nsword way must be opened. Come on ye, who wish to behold your homes,\r\nyour parents, your wives, and your children, follow me in the way in\r\nwhich you shall see me lead you on. It is not a wall, not a rampart, but\r\narmed men that stand in your way with arms in your hands. In valour you\r\nare equal to them; in necessity, which is the ultimate and most\r\neffective weapon, superior.\" As he uttered these words and was putting\r\nthem into execution, they, renewing the shout and following him, make a\r\npush in that quarter where Postumius Alba had opposed his troops to\r\nthem: and they made the victor give ground, until the dictator came up,\r\nas his own men were now retreating. To that quarter the whole weight of\r\nthe battle was now turned. On Messius alone the fortune of the enemy\r\ndepends. Many wounds and great slaughter now took place on both sides.\r\nBy this time not even the Roman generals themselves fight without\r\nreceiving wounds, one of them, Postumius, retired from the field having\r\nhis skull fractured by a stroke of a stone; neither the dictator could\r\nbe removed by a wound in the shoulder, nor Fabius by having his thigh\r\nalmost pinned to his horse, nor the consul by his arm being cut off,\r\nfrom the perilous conflict.\r\n\r\n29. Messius, with a band of the bravest youths, by a furious charge\r\nthrough heaps of slaughtered foes, was carried on to the camp of the\r\nVolscians, which had not yet been taken: the same route the entire body\r\nof the army followed. The consul, pursuing them in their disordered\r\nflight to the very rampart, attacks both the camp and the rampart; in\r\nthe same direction the dictator also brings up his forces on the other\r\nside. The assault was conducted with no less intrepidity than the battle\r\nhad been. They say that the consul even threw a standard within the\r\nrampart, in order that the soldiers might push on the more briskly, and\r\nthat the first impression was made in recovering the standard. The\r\ndictator also, having levelled the rampart, had now carried the fight\r\ninto the camp. Then the enemy began in every direction to throw down\r\ntheir arms and to surrender: and their camp also being taken, all the\r\nenemy were set up to sale, except the senators.[156] Part of the plunder\r\nwas restored to the Latins and Hernicians, when they demanded their\r\nproperty; the remainder the dictator sold by auction: and the consul,\r\nbeing invested with the command of the camp, he himself, entering the\r\ncity in triumph, resigned his dictatorship. Some writers cast a gloom on\r\nthe memory of this glorious dictatorship, when they state that his son,\r\nthough victorious, was beheaded by Aulus Postumius, because, tempted by\r\na favourable opportunity of fighting to advantage, he had left his post\r\nwithout orders. We are disposed to refuse our belief; and we are\r\nwarranted by the variety of opinions on the matter. And it is an\r\nargument against it, that such orders have been entitled \"Manlian,\" not\r\n\"Postumian,\" since the person who first set on foot so barbarous a\r\nprecedent, was likely to obtain the signal title of cruelty. Besides,\r\nthe cognomen of \"Imperiosus\" was affixed to Manlius: Postumius has not\r\nbeen marked by any hateful brand. Caius Julius the consul, in the\r\nabsence of his colleague, without casting lots, dedicated the temple of\r\nApollo: Quintius resenting this, when, after disbanding his army, he\r\nreturned into the city, made a complaint of it in the senate to no\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nTo the year marked by great achievements is added an event which seemed\r\nto have no relation to the interest of Rome, viz. that the\r\nCarthaginians, destined to be such formidable enemies, then, for the\r\nfirst times on the occasion of some disturbances among the Sicilians,\r\ntransported an army into Sicily in aid of one of the parties.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 156: _Senators._ Niebuhr, ii. note 995, seems to doubt whether\r\nthese belonged to single cities or were the senators of the entire\r\nVolscian nation.]\r\n\r\n30. In the city efforts were made by the tribunes of the people that\r\nmilitary tribunes with consular power should be elected; nor could the\r\npoint be carried. Lucius Papirius Crassus and Lucius Junius were made\r\nconsuls. When the ambassadors of the Æquans solicited a treaty from the\r\nsenate, and instead of a treaty a surrender was pointed out to them,\r\nthey obtained a truce for eight years. The affairs of the Volscians, in\r\naddition to the disaster sustained at Algidum, were involved in strifes\r\nand seditions by an obstinate contention between the advocates for peace\r\nand those for war. The Romans enjoyed tranquillity on all sides. The\r\nconsuls, having ascertained through the information of one of the\r\ncollege, that a law regarding the appraising of the fines,[157] which\r\nwas very acceptable to the people, was about to be introduced by the\r\ntribunes, took the lead themselves in proposing it. The new consuls were\r\nLucius Sergius Fidenas a second time, and Hostus Lucretius Tricipitinus.\r\nDuring their consulate nothing worth mentioning occurred. The consuls\r\nwho followed them were Aulus Cornelius Cossus and Titus Quintius Pennus\r\na second time. The Veientians made excursions into the Roman territory.\r\nA report existed that some of the youth of the Fidenatians had been\r\nparticipators in that depredation; and the cognizance of that matter was\r\nleft to Lucius Sergius, and Quintus Servilius and Mamercus Æmilius. Some\r\nof them were sent into banishment to Ostia, because it did not appear\r\nsufficiently clear why during these days they had been absent from\r\nFidenæ. A number of new settlers was added, and the land of those who\r\nhad fallen in war was assigned to them. There was very great distress\r\nthat year in consequence of drought; there was not only a deficiency of\r\nrain; but the earth also destitute of its natural moisture, scarcely\r\nenabled the rivers to flow. In some places the want of water occasioned\r\nheaps of cattle, which had died of thirst, around the springs and\r\nrivulets which were dried up; others were carried off by the mange; and\r\nthe distempers spread by infection to the human subject, and first\r\nassailed the husbandmen and slaves; soon after the city becomes filled\r\nwith them; and not only were men's bodies afflicted by the contagion,\r\nbut superstitions of various kinds, and most of them of foreign growth,\r\ntook possession of their minds; persons, to whom minds enslaved by\r\nsuperstition were a source of gain, introducing by pretending to\r\ndivination new modes of sacrificing; until a sense of public shame now\r\nreached the leading men of the state, seeing in all the streets and\r\nchapels extraneous and unaccustomed ceremonies of expiation for the\r\npurpose of obtaining the favour of the gods. A charge was then given to\r\nthe ædiles, that they should see that no other than Roman gods should be\r\nworshipped, nor in any other manner, save that of the country. Their\r\nresentment against the Veientians was deferred till the following year,\r\nCaius Servilius Ahala and Lucius Papirius Mugillanus being consuls. Then\r\nalso superstitious influences prevented the immediate declaration of war\r\nor the armies being sent; they deemed it necessary that heralds should\r\nbe first sent to demand restitution. There had been battles fought\r\nlately with the Veientians at Nomentum and Fidenæ; and after that a\r\ntruce, not a peace, had been concluded; of which both the time had\r\nexpired and they had renewed hostilities before the expiration. Heralds\r\nhowever were sent; and when, according to ancient usage, they were sworn\r\nand demanded restitution, their application was not listened to. Then\r\narose a dispute whether a war should be declared by order of the people,\r\nor whether a decree of the senate would be sufficient. The tribunes, by\r\nthreatening that they would stop the levy, so far prevailed that the\r\nconsuls should take the sense of the people concerning the war. All the\r\ncenturies voted for it. In this particular also the commons showed a\r\nsuperiority by gaining this point, that consuls should not be elected\r\nfor the next year.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 157: _Fines_. The fines imposed in early times were certain\r\nnumbers of sheep or oxen; afterwards it was ordered by law that these\r\nfines should be appraised and the value paid in money. Another law fixed\r\na certain rate at which the cattle should be estimated, 100 asses for an\r\nox, 10 for a sheep.]\r\n\r\n31. Four military tribunes with consular authority were elected--Titus\r\nQuintius Pennus, from the consulship, Caius Furius, Marcus Postumius,\r\nand Aulus Cornelius Cossus. Of these Cossus held the command in the\r\ncity. The other three, after the levy was held, set out to Veii, and\r\nwere an instance how mischievous in military affairs is a plurality of\r\ncommanders. By insisting each on his own plans, whilst they severally\r\nentertained different views, they left an opportunity open to the enemy\r\nto take them at advantage. For the Veientians, taking an opportunity,\r\nattacked their line whilst still uncertain as to their movements, some\r\nordering the signal to be given, others a retreat to be sounded: their\r\ncamp, which was nigh at hand, received them in their confusion and\r\nturning their backs. There was more disgrace therefore than loss. The\r\nstate, unaccustomed to defeat, was become melancholy; they hated the\r\ntribunes, they insisted on a dictator, the hopes of the state now seemed\r\nto rest on him. When a religious scruple interfered here also, lest a\r\ndictator could not be appointed except by a consul, the augurs on being\r\nconsulted removed that scruple. Aulus Cornelius nominated Mamercus\r\nÆmilius, and he himself was nominated by him master of the horse. So\r\nlittle did censorial animadversion avail, so as to prevent them from\r\nseeking a regulator of their affairs from a family unmeritedly censured,\r\nas soon as the condition of the state stood in need of genuine merit.\r\nThe Veientians elated with their success, having sent ambassadors around\r\nthe states of Etruria, boasting that three Roman generals had been\r\nbeaten by them in an engagement, though they could not effect a public\r\nco-operation in their designs, procured volunteers from all quarters\r\nallured by the hope of plunder. The state of the Fidenatians alone\r\ndetermined on renewing hostilities; and as if it would be an impiety to\r\ncommence war unless with guilt, after staining their arms with the blood\r\nof the new settlers there, as they had on a former occasion with that of\r\nthe ambassadors, they join the Veientians. After this the leading men of\r\nthe two states consulted whether they should select Veii or Fidenæ as\r\nthe seat of war. Fidenæ appeared the more convenient. Accordingly,\r\nhaving crossed the Tiber, the Veientians transferred the war thither.\r\nThere was great consternation at Rome. The army being recalled from\r\nVeii, and that same army dispirited in consequence of their defeat, the\r\ncamp is pitched before the Colline gate, and armed soldiers are posted\r\nalong the walls, and a suspension of all civil business is proclaimed in\r\nthe forum, and the shops were closed; and every place becomes more like\r\nto a camp than a city.\r\n\r\n32. Then the dictator, having sent criers through the streets, and\r\nhaving summoned the alarmed citizens to an assembly, began to chide them\r\n\"that they allowed their minds to depend on such slight impulses of\r\nfortune, that, on the receipt of a trifling loss, which itself was\r\nsustained not by the bravery of the enemy, nor by the cowardice of the\r\nRoman army, but by the disagreement of the generals, they now dreaded\r\nthe Veientian enemy, six times vanquished, and Fidenæ, which was almost\r\ntaken oftener than attacked. That both the Romans and the enemies were\r\nthe same as they were for so many ages: that they retained the same\r\nspirits, the same bodily strength, the same arms. That he himself,\r\nMamercus Æmilius, was also the same dictator, who formerly defeated the\r\narmies of the Veientians and Fidenatians, with the additional support of\r\nthe Faliscians, at Nomentum. That his master of the horse, Aulus\r\nCornelius, would be the same in the field, he who, as military tribune\r\nin a former war, slew Lar Tolumnius, king of the Veientians, in the\r\nsight of both armies, and brought the _spolia opima_ into the temple of\r\nJupiter Feretrius. Wherefore that they should take up arms, mindful that\r\nwith them were triumphs, with them spoils, with them victory; with the\r\nenemy the guilt of murdering the ambassadors contrary to the law of\r\nnations, the massacre of the Fidenatian colonists in time of peace, the\r\ninfraction of truces, a seventh unsuccessful revolt. As soon as they\r\nshould bring their camp near them, he was fully confident that the joy\r\nof these most impious enemies at the disgrace of the Roman army would\r\nnot be of long continuance, and that the Roman people would be convinced\r\nhow much better those persons deserved of the republic, who nominated\r\nhim dictator for the third time, than those who, in consequence of his\r\nabolishing the despotism of the censorship, would cast a slur on his\r\nsecond dictatorship.\" Having offered up his vows and set out on his\r\nmarch, he pitches his camp fifteen hundred paces on this side of Fidenæ,\r\ncovered on his right by mountains, on his left by the river Tiber. He\r\norders Titus Quintius Pennus to take possession of the mountains, and to\r\npost himself secretly on some eminence which might be in the enemy's\r\nrear. On the following day, when the Etrurians had marched out to the\r\nfield, full of confidence in consequence of their accidental success of\r\nthe preceding day, rather than of their good fighting, he himself,\r\nhaving delayed a little until the senate brought back word that Quintius\r\nhad gained an eminence nigh to the citadel of Fidenæ, puts his troops\r\ninto motion and led on his line of infantry in order of battle in their\r\nquickest pace against the enemy: the master of the horse he directs not\r\nto commence the fight without orders; that, when it would be necessary,\r\nhe would give the signal for the aid of the cavalry; then that he would\r\nconduct the action, mindful of his fight with the king, mindful of the\r\nrich oblation, and of Romulus and Jupiter Feretrius. The legions begin\r\nthe conflict with impetuosity. The Romans, fired with hatred, gratified\r\nthat feeling both with deeds and words, calling the Fidenatian impious,\r\nthe Veientian robbers, truce-breakers, stained with the horrid murder of\r\nambassadors, sprinkled with the blood of their own brother-colonists,\r\ntreacherous allies, and dastardly enemies.\r\n\r\n33. In the very first onset they had made an impression on the enemy;\r\nwhen on a sudden, the gates of Fidenæ flying open, a strange sort of\r\narmy sallies forth, unheard of and unseen before that time. An immense\r\nmultitude armed with fire and all blazing with fire-brands, as if urged\r\non by fanatical rage, rush on the enemy: and the form of this unusual\r\nmode of fighting frightened the Romans for the moment. Then the\r\ndictator, having called to him the master of the horse and the cavalry,\r\nand also Quintius from the mountains animating the fight, hastens\r\nhimself to the left wing, which, more nearly resembling a conflagration\r\nthan a battle, had from terror given way to the flames, and exclaims\r\nwith a loud voice, \"Vanquished by smoke, driven from your ground as if a\r\nswarm of bees, will ye yield to an unarmed enemy? will ye not extinguish\r\nthe fires with the sword? or if it is with fire, not with weapons, we\r\nare to fight, will ye not, each in his post, snatch those brands, and\r\nhurl them on them? Come, mindful of the Roman name, of the valour of\r\nyour fathers, and of your own, turn this conflagration against the city\r\nof your enemy, and destroy Fidenæ by its own flames, which ye could not\r\nreclaim by your kindness. The blood of your ambassadors and colonists\r\nand the desolation of your frontiers suggest this.\" At the command of\r\nthe dictator the whole line advanced; the firebrands that were\r\ndischarged are partly caught up; others are wrested by force: the armies\r\non either side are now armed with fire. The master of the horse too, on\r\nhis part, introduces among the cavalry a new mode of fighting; he\r\ncommands his men to take the bridles off their horses: and he himself at\r\ntheir head, putting spurs to his own, dashing forward, is carried by the\r\nunbridled steed into the midst of the fires: the other horses also being\r\nurged on carry their riders with unrestrained speed against the enemy.\r\nThe dust being raised and mixed with smoke excluded the light from the\r\neyes of both men and horses. That appearance which had terrified the\r\nsoldiers, no longer terrified the horses. The cavalry therefore,\r\nwherever they penetrated, produced a heap of bodies like a ruin. A new\r\nshout then assailed their ears; and when this attracted the attention of\r\nthe two armies looking with amazement at each other, the dictator cries\r\nout \"that his lieutenant-general and his men had attacked the enemy on\r\nthe rear:\" he himself, on the shout being renewed, advances against them\r\nwith redoubled vigour. When two armies, two different battles pressed on\r\nthe Etrurians, now surrounded, in front and rear, and there was now no\r\nmeans of flight back to their camp, nor to the mountains, where new\r\nenemies were ready to oppose them, and the horses, now freed from their\r\nbridles, had scattered their riders in every direction, the principal\r\npart of the Veientians make precipitately for the Tiber. Such of the\r\nFidenatians as survived, bend their course to the city of Fidenæ. Their\r\nflight hurries them in their state of panic into the midst of slaughter;\r\nthey are cut to pieces on the banks; others, when driven into the water,\r\nwere carried off by the eddies; even those who could swim were weighed\r\ndown by fatigue, by their wounds, and by fright; a few out of the many\r\nmake their way across. The other party make their way through the camp\r\ninto the city. In the same direction their impetuosity carries the\r\nRomans in pursuit; Quintius more especially, and with him those who had\r\njust come down from the mountain, being the soldiers who were freshest\r\nfor labour, because they had come up towards the close of the\r\nengagement.\r\n\r\n34. These, after they entered the gate mixed with the enemy, make their\r\nway to the walls, and raise from their summit a signal to their friends\r\nof the town being taken. When the dictator saw this, (for he had now\r\nmade his way into the deserted camp of the enemy,) he leads on the\r\nsoldiers, who were now anxious to disperse themselves in quest of booty,\r\nentertaining a hope of a greater spoil in the city, to the gate; and\r\nbeing admitted within the walls, he proceeds to the citadel, whither he\r\nsaw the crowds of fugitives hurrying. Nor was the slaughter in the city\r\nless than in the battle; until, throwing down their arms, begging\r\nnothing but their life, they surrendered to the dictator. The city and\r\ncamp are plundered. On the following day, one captive being allotted to\r\neach horseman and centurion, and two to those whose valour had been\r\nconspicuous, and the rest being sold by auction, the dictator in triumph\r\nled back to Rome his army victorious and enriched with spoil; and having\r\nordered the master of the horse to resign his office, he immediately\r\nresigned his own on the sixteenth day (after he had obtained it);\r\nsurrendering in peace that authority which he had received during war\r\nand trepidations. Some annals have reported that there was a naval\r\nengagement with the Veientians at Fidenæ, a thing as difficult as it was\r\nincredible, the river even now not being broad enough for such a\r\npurpose; and at that time, as we learn from old writers, being\r\nconsiderably narrower: except that perhaps in disputing the passage of\r\nthe river, magnifying, as will happen, the scuffle of a few ships, they\r\nsought the empty honour of a naval victory.\r\n\r\n35. The following year had as military tribunes with consular power\r\nAulus Sempronius Atratinus, Lucius Quintius Cincinnatus, Lucius Furius\r\nMedullinus, Lucius Horatius Barbatus. To the Veientians a truce for\r\ntwenty years was granted, and one for three years to the Æquans, though\r\nthey had solicited one for a longer term. There was quiet also from city\r\nriots. The year following, though not distinguished either by war abroad\r\nor by disturbance at home, was rendered celebrated by the games which\r\nhad been vowed during the war, both through the magnificence displayed\r\nin them by the military tribunes, and also through the concourse of the\r\nneighbouring states. The tribunes with consular power were Appius\r\nClaudius Crassus, Spurius Nautilus Rutilus, Lucius Sergius Fidenas,\r\nSextus Julius Iulus. The exhibition, besides that they had come with the\r\npublic concurrence of their states, was rendered still more grateful to\r\nthe strangers by the courtesy of their hosts. After the games seditious\r\nharangues were delivered by the tribunes of the commons upbraiding the\r\nmultitude; \"that stupified with admiration of those persons whom they\r\nhated, they kept themselves in a state of eternal bondage; and they not\r\nonly had not the courage to aspire to the recovery of their hopes of a\r\nshare in the consulship, but even in the electing of military tribunes,\r\nwhich elections lay open to both patricians and commons, they neither\r\nthought of themselves nor of their party. That they must therefore cease\r\nfeeling surprised why no one busied himself about the interests of the\r\ncommons: that labour and danger would be expended on objects whence\r\nemolument and honour might be expected. That there was nothing men would\r\nnot attempt if great rewards were proposed for those who make great\r\nattempts. That any tribune of the commons should rush blindly at great\r\nrisk and with no advantage into contentions, in consequence of which he\r\nmay rest satisfied that the patricians against whom he should strive,\r\nwill persecute him with inexpiable war, whilst with the commons in whose\r\nbehalf he may have contended he will not be one whit the more honoured,\r\nwas a thing neither to be expected nor required. That by great honours\r\nminds became great. That no plebeian would think meanly of himself, when\r\nthey ceased to be despised by others. That the experiment should be at\r\nlength made in the case of one or two, whether there were any plebeian\r\ncapable of sustaining a high dignity, or whether it were next to a\r\nmiracle and a prodigy that any one sprung from the commons should be a\r\nbrave and industrious man. That by the utmost energy the point had been\r\ngained, that military tribunes with consular power might be chosen from\r\namong the commons also. That men well approved both in the civil and\r\nmilitary line had stood as candidates. That during the first years they\r\nwere hooted at, rejected, and ridiculed by the patricians: that at\r\nlength they had ceased to expose themselves to insult. Nor did he for\r\nhis part see why the law itself might not be repealed; by which that was\r\nmade lawful which never could take place; for that there would be less\r\ncause for blushing at the injustice of the law, than if they were to be\r\npassed over through their own want of merit.\"\r\n\r\n36. Harangues of this kind, listened to with approbation, induced some\r\npersons to stand for the military tribuneship, each avowing that if in\r\noffice he would propose something to the advantage of the commons. Hopes\r\nwere held out of a distribution of the public land, of colonies to be\r\nplanted, and of money to be raised for the pay of the soldiers, by a tax\r\nimposed on the proprietors of estates. Then an opportunity was laid\r\nhold of by the military tribunes, so that during the absence of most\r\npersons from the city, when the patricians who were to be recalled by a\r\nprivate intimation were to attend on a certain day, a decree of the\r\nsenate might be passed in the absence of the tribunes of the commons;\r\nthat a report existed that the Volscians had gone forth into the lands\r\nof Hernici to commit depredations, the military tribunes were to set out\r\nto examine into the matter, and that an assembly should be held for the\r\nelection of consuls. Having set out, they leave Appius Claudius, son of\r\nthe decemvir, as prefect of the city, a young man of great energy, and\r\none who had ever from his cradle imbibed a hatred of the tribunes and\r\nthe commons. The tribunes of the commons had nothing for which they\r\nshould contend, either with those persons now absent, who had procured\r\nthe decree of the senate, nor with Appius, the matter being now all\r\nover.\r\n\r\n37. Caius Sempronius Atratinus, Quintus Fabius Vibulanus were elected\r\nconsuls. An affair in a foreign country, but one deserving of record, is\r\nstated to have happened in that year. Vulturnum, a city of the\r\nEtrurians, which is now Capua, was taken by the Samnites; and was called\r\nCapua from their leader, Capys, or, what is more probable, from its\r\nchampaign grounds. But they took possession of it, after having been\r\nadmitted into a share of the city and its lands, when the Etrurians had\r\nbeen previously much harassed in war; afterwards the new-comers attacked\r\nand massacred during the night the old inhabitants, when on a festival\r\nday they had become heavy with wine and sleep. After those transactions\r\nthe consuls whom we have mentioned entered on office on the ides of\r\nDecember. Now not only those who had been expressly sent, reported that\r\na Volscian war was impending; but ambassadors also from the Latins and\r\nHernicians brought word, \"that never at any former period were the\r\nVolscians more intent either in selecting commanders, or in levying an\r\narmy; that they commonly observed either that arms and war were to be\r\nfor ever consigned to oblivion, and the yoke to be submitted to; or that\r\nthey must not yield to those, with whom they contended for empire,\r\neither in valour, perseverance, or military discipline.\" The accounts\r\nthey brought were not unfounded; but neither the senate were so much\r\naffected by the circumstance; and Caius Sempronius, to whom the province\r\nfell by lot, relying on fortune, as if a most constant object, because\r\nhe was the leader of a victorious state against one frequently\r\nvanquished, executed all his measures carelessly and remissly; so that\r\nthere was more of the Roman discipline in the Volscian than in the Roman\r\narmy. Success therefore, as on many other occasions, attended merit. In\r\nthe first battle, which was entered on by Sempronius without either\r\nprudence or caution, they met, without their lines being strengthened by\r\nreserves, or their cavalry being properly stationed. The shout was the\r\nfirst presage which way the victory would incline; that raised by the\r\nenemy was louder and more continued; that by the Romans, being\r\ndissonant, uneven, and frequently repeated in a lifeless manner,\r\nbetrayed the prostration of their spirits. The enemy advancing the more\r\nboldly on this account, pushed with their shields, brandished their\r\nswords; on the other side the helmets drooped, as the men looked around,\r\nand disconcerted they waver, and keep close to the main body. The\r\nensigns at one time standing their ground are deserted by their\r\nsupporters, at another time they retreat between their respective\r\ncompanies. As yet there was no absolute flight, nor was there victory.\r\nThe Romans rather covered themselves than fought. The Volscians\r\nadvanced, pushed against their line, saw more of the enemy slain than\r\nrunning away.\r\n\r\n38. They now give way in every direction, the consul Sempronius in vain\r\nchiding and exhorting them; neither his authority nor his dignity\r\navailed any thing; and they would presently have turned their backs to\r\nthe enemy, had not Sextus Tempanius, a commander of a troop of horse,\r\nwith great presence of mind brought them support, when matters were now\r\ndesperate. When he called out aloud, \"that the horsemen who wished for\r\nthe safety of the commonwealth should leap from their horses,\" the\r\nhorsemen of all the troops being moved, as if by the consul's orders, he\r\nsays, \"unless this cohort by its arms can stop the progress of the\r\nenemy, there is an end of the empire. Follow my spear as your standard.\r\nShow to the Romans and Volscians, that no cavalry are equal to you as\r\ncavalry, nor infantry to you as infantry.\" When this exhortation was\r\napproved by a loud shout, he advances, holding his spear aloft. Wherever\r\nthey go, they open a passage for themselves; putting forward their\r\ntargets they force on to the place where they saw the distress of their\r\nfriends greatest. The fight is restored in every part, as far as their\r\nonset reached; nor was there a doubt but that if so few could,\r\naccomplish every thing at the same time, the enemy would have turned\r\ntheir backs.\r\n\r\n39. And when they could now be withstood in no part, the Volscian\r\ncommander gives a signal, that an opening should be made for the\r\ntargeteers, the enemy's new cohort; until carried away by their\r\nimpetuosity they should be cut off from their own party. When this was\r\ndone, the horsemen were intercepted; nor were they able to force their\r\nway in the same direction as that through which they had passed; the\r\nenemy being thickest in that part through which they had made their way;\r\nand the consul and Roman legions, when they could no where see that\r\nparty which had lately been a protection to the entire army, lest the\r\nenemy should cut down so many men of distinguished valour by cutting\r\nthem off, push forward at all hazards. The Volscians, forming two\r\nfronts, sustained the attack of the consul and the legions on the one\r\nhand, with the other front pressed on Tempanius and the horsemen: and\r\nwhen they after repeated attempts were unable to force their way to\r\ntheir own party, they took possession of an eminence, and defended\r\nthemselves by forming a circle, not without taking vengeance on their\r\nenemies. Nor was there an end of the battle before night. The consul\r\nalso, never relaxing his efforts as long as any light remained, kept the\r\nenemy employed. The night at length separated them undecided as to\r\nvictory; and such a panic seized both camps, from their uncertainty as\r\nto the issue, that, leaving behind their wounded and a great part of the\r\nbaggage, both armies, as if vanquished, betook themselves to the\r\nadjoining mountains. The eminence, however, continued to be besieged\r\ntill beyond midnight; but when word was brought to the besiegers that\r\nthe camp was deserted, supposing that their own party had been defeated,\r\nthey too fled, each whithersoever his fears carried him in the dark.\r\nTempanius, through fear of an ambush, detained his men till daylight.\r\nThen having himself descended with a few men to look about, when he\r\nascertained by inquiring from some of the wounded enemy that the camp of\r\nthe Volscians was deserted, he joyously calls down his men from the\r\neminence, and makes his way into the Roman camp: where, when he found\r\nevery thing waste and deserted, and the same unsightliness as with the\r\nenemy, before the discovery of this mistake should bring back the\r\nVolscians, taking with him all the wounded he could, and not knowing\r\nwhat route the consul had taken, he proceeds by the shortest roads to\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\n40. The report of the unsuccessful battle and of the abandonment of the\r\ncamp had already reached there; and, above all other objects, the\r\nhorsemen were mourned not more with private than with public grief; and\r\nthe consul Fabius, the city also being now alarmed, stationed guards\r\nbefore the gates; when the horsemen, seen at a distance, not without\r\nsome degree of terror by those who doubted who they were, but soon being\r\nrecognised, from a state of dread produced such joy, that a shout\r\npervaded the city, of persons congratulating each other on the horsemen\r\nhaving returned safe and victorious; and from the houses a little before\r\nin mourning, as they had given up their friends for lost, persons were\r\nseen running into the street; and the affrighted mothers and wives,\r\nforgetful of all ceremony through joy, ran out to meet the band, each\r\none rushing up to her own friends, and through extravagance of delight\r\nscarcely retaining power over body or mind. The tribunes of the people\r\nwho had appointed a day of trial for Marcus Postumius and Titus\r\nQuintius, because of the unsuccessful battle fought near Veii by their\r\nmeans, thought that an opportunity now presented itself for renewing the\r\npublic odium against them by reason of the recent displeasure felt\r\nagainst the consul Sempronius. Accordingly, a meeting being convened,\r\nwhen they exclaimed aloud that the commonwealth had been betrayed at\r\nVeii by the generals, that the army was afterwards betrayed by the\r\nconsul in the country of the Volscians, because they had escaped with\r\nimpunity, that the very brave horsemen were consigned to slaughter, that\r\nthe camp was shamefully deserted; Caius Julius, one of the tribunes,\r\nordered the horseman Tempanius to be cited, and in presence of them he\r\nsays, \"Sextus Tempanius, I ask of you, whether do you think that Caius\r\nSempronius the consul either commenced the battle at the proper time, or\r\nstrengthened his line with reserves, or that he discharged any duty of a\r\ngood consul? or did you yourself, when the Roman legions were beaten, of\r\nyour own judgment dismount the cavalry and restore the fight? then when\r\nyou and the horsemen with you were cut off from our army, did either the\r\nconsul himself come to your relief, or did he send you succour? Then\r\nagain, on the following day, had you any assistance any where? or did\r\nyou and your cohort by your own bravery make your way into your camp?\r\nDid you find a consul or an army in the camp, or did you find the camp\r\nforsaken, the wounded soldiers left behind? These things are to be\r\ndeclared by you this day, as becomes your valour and honour, by which\r\nalone the republic has stood its ground on this day. In a word, where is\r\nCaius Sempronius, where are our legions? Have you been deserted, or have\r\nyou deserted the consul and the army? In a word, have we been defeated,\r\nor have we gained the victory?\"\r\n\r\n41. In answer to these questions the language of Tempanius is said to\r\nhave been entirely devoid of elegance, but firm as became a soldier, not\r\nvainly parading his own merits, nor exulting in the inculpation of\r\nothers: \"How much military skill Caius Sempronius possessed, that it was\r\nnot his business as a soldier to judge with respect to his commander,\r\nbut the business of the Roman people when they were choosing consuls at\r\nthe election. Wherefore that they should not require from him a detail\r\nof the plans to be adopted by a general, nor of the qualifications to be\r\nlooked for in a consul; which matters required to be considered by great\r\nminds and great capacities; but what he saw, that he could state. That\r\nbefore he was separated from his own party, he saw the consul fighting\r\nin the first line, encouraging his men, actively employed amid the Roman\r\nensigns and the weapons of the enemy; that he was afterwards carried out\r\nof sight of his friends. That from the din and shouting he perceived\r\nthat the contest was protracted till night; nor did he think it\r\npossible, from the great numbers of the enemy, that they could force\r\ntheir way to the eminence which he had seized on. Where the army might\r\nbe, he did not know; he supposed that as he protected himself and his\r\nmen, by advantage of situation when in danger, in the same way the\r\nconsul, for the purpose of preserving his army, had selected a more\r\nsecure place for his camp. Nor did he think that the affairs of the\r\nVolscians were in a better condition than those of the Roman people.\r\nThat fortune and the night had occasioned a multitude of mistakes on\r\nboth sides:\" and then when he begged that they would not detain him,\r\nfatigued with toil and wounds, he was dismissed with high encomiums, not\r\nmore on his bravery than his modesty. While these things were going on,\r\nthe consul was at the temple of Rest on the road leading to Lavici.\r\nWaggons and other modes of conveyance were sent thither from the city,\r\nand took up the army, exhausted by the action and the travelling by\r\nnight. Soon after the consul entered the city, not more anxious to\r\nremove the blame from himself, than to bestow on Tempanius the praises\r\nso well deserved. Whilst the citizens were still sorrowful in\r\nconsequence of their ill success, and incensed against their leaders,\r\nMarcus Postumius, being arraigned and brought before them, he who had\r\nbeen military tribune with consular power at Veii, is condemned in a\r\nfine of ten thousand _asses_ in weight, of brass. His colleague, Titus\r\nQuintius, who endeavoured to shift the entire blame of that period on\r\nhis previously condemned colleague, was acquitted by all the tribes,\r\nbecause both in the country of the Volscians, when consul, he had\r\nconducted business successfully under the auspices of the dictator,\r\nPostumius Tubertus, and also at Fidenæ, as lieutenant-general of another\r\ndictator, Mamercus Æmilius. The memory of his father, Cincinnatus, a man\r\nhighly deserving of veneration, is said to have been serviceable to him,\r\nas also Capitolinus Quintius, now advanced in years, humbly entreating\r\nthat they would not suffer him who had so short a time to live to be the\r\nbearer of such dismal tidings to Cincinnatus.\r\n\r\n42. The commons elected as tribunes of the people, though absent, Sextus\r\nTempanius, Aulus Sellius, Sextus Antistius, and Spurius Icilius, whom\r\nthe horsemen by the advice of Tempanius had appointed to command them as\r\ncenturions. The senate, inasmuch as the name of consuls was now becoming\r\ndispleasing through the hatred felt towards Sempronius, ordered that\r\nmilitary tribunes with consular power should be elected. Those elected\r\nwere Lucius Manlius Capitolinus, Quintus Antonius Merenda, Lucius\r\nPapirius Mugillanus. At the very commencement of the year, Lucius\r\nHortensius, a tribune of the people, appointed a day of trial for Caius\r\nSempronius, a consul of the preceding year, and when his four\r\ncolleagues, in sight of the Roman people, entreated him that he would\r\nnot involve in vexation their unoffending general, in whose case\r\nnothing but fortune could be blamed, Hortensius took offence, thinking\r\nit to be a trying of his perseverance, and that the accused depended not\r\non the entreaties of the tribunes, which were merely used for show, but\r\non their protection. Therefore now turning to him, he asked, \"Where were\r\nthose patrician airs, where the spirit supported and confiding in\r\nconscious innocence; that a man of consular dignity took shelter under\r\nthe shade of the tribunes?\" Another time to his colleagues, \"What do you\r\nintend doing, if I go on with the prosecution; will you wrest their\r\njurisdiction from the people and overturn the tribunitian authority?\"\r\nWhen they said that, \"both with respect to Sempronius and all others,\r\nthe power of the Roman people was supreme; that they had neither the\r\nwill nor the power to do away with the judgment of the people; but if\r\ntheir entreaties for their commander, who was to them in the light of a\r\nparent, were to prove of no avail, that they would change their apparel\r\nalong with him:\" then Hortensius says, \"The commons of Rome shall not\r\nsee their tribunes in the garb of culprits. To Caius Sempronius I have\r\nnothing more to say, since when in office he has attained this good\r\nfortune, to be so dear to his soldiers.\" Nor was the dutiful attachment\r\nof the four tribunes more grateful alike to the commons and patricians,\r\nthan was the temper of Hortensius, which yielded so readily to their\r\njust entreaties. Fortune no longer indulged the Æquans, who had embraced\r\nthe doubtful victory of the Volscians as their own.\r\n\r\n43. In the year following, when Numerius Fabius Vibulanus and Titus\r\nQuintius Capitolinus, son of Capitolinus, were consuls, nothing worth\r\nmentioning was performed under the conduct of Fabius, to whom that\r\nprovince had fallen by lot. When the Æquans had merely showed their\r\ndastardly army, they were routed by a shameful flight, without any great\r\nhonour to the consul; therefore a triumph is refused. However in\r\nconsequence of having effaced the ignominy of Sempronius's defeat, he\r\nwas allowed to enter the city with an ovation. As the war was terminated\r\nwith less difficulty than they had apprehended, so in the city, from a\r\nstate of tranquillity, an unexpected mass of dissensions arose between\r\nthe commons and patricians, which commenced with doubling the number of\r\nquæstors. When the patricians approved most highly of this measure,\r\n(viz. that, besides the two city quæstors, two should attend the\r\nconsuls to discharge some duties of the military service,) after it was\r\nmoved by the consuls, the tribunes of the commons contended in\r\nopposition to the consuls, that half of the quæstors should be appointed\r\nfrom the commons; for up to that time all patricians were appointed.\r\nAgainst this proceeding both the consuls and patricians at first strove\r\nwith all their might; then by making a concession that the will of the\r\npeople should be equally free in the case of quæstors, as they enjoyed\r\nin the election of tribunes with consular power, when they produced but\r\nlittle effect, they gave up the entire matter about increasing the\r\nnumber of quæstors. When relinquished, the tribunes take it up, and\r\nother seditious schemes are continually started, among which is that of\r\nthe agrarian law. On account of these disturbances the senate was\r\ndesirous that consuls should be elected rather than tribunes, but no\r\ndecree of the senate could be passed in consequence of the protests of\r\nthe tribunes; the government from being consular came to an interregnum,\r\nand not even that without a great struggle (for the tribunes prevented\r\nthe patricians from meeting). When the greater part of the following\r\nyear was wasted in contentions by the new tribunes of the commons and\r\nsome interreges, the tribunes at one time hindering the patricians from\r\nassembling to declare an interrex, at another time preventing the\r\ninterrex from passing a decree regarding the election of consuls; at\r\nlength Lucius Papirius Mugillanus, being nominated interrex, censuring\r\nnow the patricians, now the tribunes of the people, asserted \"that the\r\nstate, deserted and forsaken by man, being taken up by the providence\r\nand care of the gods, subsisted by the Veientian truce and the\r\ndilatoriness of the Æquans. From which quarter if any alarm of danger be\r\nheard, did it please them that the state, left without a patrician\r\nmagistrate, should be taken by surprise? that there should be no army,\r\nnor general to enlist one? Will they repel a foreign war by an intestine\r\none? And if they both meet, the Roman state can scarcely be saved, even\r\nby the aid of the gods, from being overwhelmed. That they, by resigning\r\neach a portion of their strict right, should establish concord by a\r\ncompromise; the patricians, by suffering military tribunes with consular\r\nauthority to be elected; the tribunes of the commons, by ceasing to\r\nprotest against the four quæstors being elected promiscuously from the\r\ncommons and patricians by the free suffrage of the people.\"\r\n\r\n44. The election of tribunes was first held. There were chosen tribunes\r\nwith consular power, Lucius Quintius Cincinnatus a third time, Lucius\r\nFurius Medullinus a second time, Marcus Manlius, Aulus Sempronius\r\nAtratinus. On the last-named tribune presiding at the election of\r\nquæstors, and among several other plebeians a son of Antistius, a\r\nplebeian tribune, and a brother of Sextus Pompilius, also a tribune of\r\nthe commons, becoming candidates, neither the power nor interest of the\r\nlatter at all availed so as to prevent those, whose fathers and\r\ngrandfathers they had seen consuls, from being preferred for their high\r\nbirth. All the tribunes of the commons became enraged, above all\r\nPompilius and Antistius were incensed at the rejection of their\r\nrelatives. \"What could this mean? that neither through their own\r\nkindnesses, nor in consequence of the injurious treatment of the\r\npatricians, nor even through the natural desire of making use of their\r\nnew right, as that is now allowed which was not allowed before, was any\r\nindividual of the commons elected if not a military tribune, not even a\r\nquæstor. That the prayers of a father in behalf of a son, those of one\r\nbrother in behalf of another, had been of no avail, though proceeding\r\nfrom tribunes of the people, a sacrosanct power created for the support\r\nof liberty. There must have been some fraud in the matter, and Aulus\r\nSempronius must have used more of artifice at the elections than was\r\ncompatible with honour.\" They complained that by the unfairness of his\r\nconduct their friends had been kept out of office. Accordingly as no\r\nattack could be made on him, secured by his innocence and by the office\r\nhe then held, they turned their resentment against Caius Sempronius,\r\nuncle to Atratinus; and, with the aid of their colleague Marcus\r\nCornelius, they entered a prosecution against him on account of the\r\ndisgrace sustained in the Volscian war. By the same tribunes mention was\r\nfrequently made in the senate concerning the division of the lands,\r\n(which scheme Caius Sempronius had always most vigorously opposed,) they\r\nsupposing, as was really the case, that the accused, should he give up\r\nthe question, would become less valued among the patricians, or by\r\npersevering up to the period of trial he would give offence to the\r\ncommons. He preferred to expose himself to the torrent of popular\r\nprejudice, and to injure his own cause, than to be wanting to the public\r\ncause; and he stood firm in the same sentiment, \"that no largess should\r\nbe made, which was sure to turn to the benefit of the three tribunes;\r\nthat it was not land was sought for the people, but odium for him. That\r\nhe too would undergo that storm with a determined mind; nor should\r\neither himself, nor any other citizen, be of so much consequence to the\r\nsenate, that in showing tenderness to an individual, a public injury may\r\nbe done.\" When the day of trial came, he, having pleaded his own cause\r\nwith a spirit by no means subdued, is condemned in a fine of fifteen\r\nthousand _asses_, though the patricians tried every means to make the\r\npeople relent. The same year Postumia, a Vestal virgin, is tried for a\r\nbreach of chastity, though guiltless of the charge; having fallen under\r\nsuspicion in consequence of her dress being too gay and her manners less\r\nreserved than becomes a virgin, not avoiding the imputation with\r\nsufficient care. The case was first deferred, she was afterwards\r\nacquitted; but the chief pontiff, by the instruction of the college,\r\ncommanded her to refrain from indiscreet mirth, and to dress with more\r\nregard to sanctity than elegance. In the same year Cumæ, a city which\r\nthe Greeks then occupied, was taken by the Campanians.\r\n\r\n45. The following year had for military tribunes with consular power,\r\nAgrippa Menenius Lanatus, Publius Lucretius Tricipitinus, Spurius\r\nNautius Rutilus: to the good fortune of the Roman people, the year was\r\nremarkable rather by great danger than by losses. The slaves conspire to\r\nset fire to the city in several quarters, and whilst the people should\r\nbe intent in bearing assistance to the houses in every direction, to\r\ntake up arms and seize the citadel and Capitol. Jupiter frustrated their\r\nhorrid designs; and the offenders, being seized on the information of\r\ntwo (accomplices), were punished. Ten thousand _asses_ in weight of\r\nbrass paid out of the treasury, a sum which at that time was considered\r\nwealth, and their freedom, was the reward conferred on the parties who\r\ndiscovered. The Æquans then began to prepare for a renewal of\r\nhostilities; and an account was brought to Rome from good authority,\r\nthat new enemies, the Lavicanians, were forming a coalition with the old\r\nones. The state had now become habituated, as it were, to the\r\nanniversary arms of the Æquans. When ambassadors were sent to Lavici\r\nand brought back from thence an evasive answer, from which it became\r\nevident that neither war was intended there, nor would peace be of long\r\ncontinuance, instructions were given to the Tusculans, that they should\r\nobserve attentively, lest any new commotion should arise at Lavici. To\r\nthe military tribunes, with consular power, of the following year,\r\nLucius Sergius Fidenas, Marcus Papirius Mugillanus, Caius Servilius the\r\nson of Priscus, in whose dictatorship Fidenæ had been taken, ambassadors\r\ncame from Tusculum, just as they entered on their office. The\r\nambassadors brought word that the Lavicanians had taken arms, and having\r\nravaged the Tusculan territory in conjunction with the army of the\r\nÆquans, that they had pitched their camp at Algidum. Then war was\r\nproclaimed against the Lavicanians; and a decree of the senate having\r\nbeen passed, that two of the tribunes should proceed to the war, and\r\nthat one should manage affairs at Rome, a contest suddenly sprung up\r\namong the tribunes. Each represented himself as a fitter person to take\r\nthe lead in the war, and scorned the management of the city as\r\ndisagreeable and inglorious. When the senate beheld with surprise the\r\nindecent contention between the colleagues, Quintus Servilius says,\r\n\"Since there is no respect either for this house, or for the\r\ncommonwealth, parental authority shall set aside this altercation of\r\nyours. My son, without having recourse to lots, shall take charge of the\r\ncity. I wish that those who are so desirous of managing the war, may\r\nconduct it with more consideration and harmony than they covet it.\"\r\n\r\n46. It was determined that the levy should not be made out of the entire\r\nbody of the people indiscriminately. Ten tribes were drawn by lot; the\r\ntwo tribunes enlisted the younger men out of these, and led them to the\r\nwar. The contentions which commenced between them in the city, were,\r\nthrough the same eager ambition for command, carried to a much greater\r\nheight in the camp: on no one point did they think alike; they contended\r\nstrenuously for their own opinion; they desired their own plans, their\r\nown commands only to be ratified; they mutually despised each other, and\r\nwere despised, until, on the remonstrances of the lieutenant-generals,\r\nit was at length so arranged, that they should hold the supreme command\r\non alternate days. When an account of these proceedings was brought to\r\nRome, Quintus Servilius, taught by years and experience, is said to\r\nhave prayed to the immortal gods, that the discord of the tribunes might\r\nnot prove more detrimental to the commonwealth than it had done at Veii:\r\nand, as if some certain disaster was impending over them, he pressed his\r\nson to enlist soldiers and prepare arms. Nor was he a false prophet. For\r\nunder the conduct of Lucius Sergius, whose day of command it was, being\r\nsuddenly attacked by the Æquans on disadvantageous ground near the\r\nenemy's camp, after having been decoyed thither by the vain hope of\r\ntaking it, because the enemy had counterfeited fear and betaken\r\nthemselves to their rampart, they were beaten down a declivity, and\r\ngreat numbers were overpowered and slaughtered by their tumbling one\r\nover the other rather than by flight: and the camp, retained with\r\ndifficulty on that day, was, on the following day, deserted by a\r\nshameful flight through the opposite gate, the enemy having invested it\r\nin several directions. The generals, lieutenant-generals, and such of\r\nthe main body of the army as kept near the colours, made their way to\r\nTusculum; others, dispersed in every direction through the fields,\r\nhastened to Rome by different roads, announcing a heavier loss than had\r\nbeen sustained. There was less of consternation, because the result\r\ncorresponded to the apprehensions of persons; and because the\r\nreinforcements, which they could look to in this distressing state of\r\nthings, had been prepared by the military tribune: and by his orders,\r\nafter the disturbance in the city was quieted by the inferior\r\nmagistrates, scouts were instantly despatched, and brought intelligence\r\nthat the generals and the army were at Tusculum; that the enemy had not\r\nremoved their camp. And, what raised their spirits most, Quintus\r\nServilius Priscus was created dictator in pursuance of a decree of the\r\nsenate; a man whose judgment in public affairs the state had experienced\r\nas well on many previous occasions, as in the issue of that war, because\r\nhe alone had expressed his apprehensions of the result of the disputes\r\namong the tribunes, before the occurrence of the misfortune; he having\r\nappointed for his master of the horse, by whom, as military tribune, he\r\nhad been nominated dictator, his own son, as some have stated, (for\r\nothers mention that Ahala Servilius was master of the horse that year;)\r\nand setting out to the war with his newly-raised army, after sending for\r\nthose who were at Tusculum, chose ground for his camp at the distance\r\nof two miles from the enemy.\r\n\r\n47. The arrogance and negligence arising from success, which had\r\npreviously existed in the Roman generals, were now transferred to the\r\nÆquans. Accordingly, when in the very first engagement the dictator had\r\nthrown the enemy's van into disorder by a charge of his cavalry, he\r\nimmediately ordered the infantry to advance, and slew one of his own\r\nstandard-bearers who hesitated in so doing. So great was the ardour to\r\nfight, that the Æquans did not stand the shock; and when, vanquished in\r\nthe field, they made for their camp in a precipitate flight, the taking\r\nof it was shorter in time and less in trouble than the battle had been.\r\nAfter the camp had been taken and plundered, and the dictator had given\r\nup the spoil to the soldiers, and the cavalry, who had pursued the enemy\r\nin their flight, brought back intelligence that all the Lavicanians were\r\nvanquished, and that a considerable number of the Æquans had fled to\r\nLavici, the army was marched to Lavici on the following day; and the\r\ntown, being invested on all sides, was taken by storm and plundered. The\r\ndictator, having marched back his victorious army to Rome, resigned his\r\noffice on the eighth day after he had been appointed; and before\r\nagrarian disturbances could be raised by the tribunes of the commons,\r\nallusion having been made to a division of the Lavicanian land, the\r\nsenate very opportunely voted in full assembly that a colony should be\r\nconducted to Lavici. One thousand five hundred colonists were sent from\r\nthe city, and received each two acres. Lavici being taken, and\r\nsubsequently Agrippa Menenius Lanatus, and Lucius Servilius Structus,\r\nand Publius Lucretius Tricipitinus, all these a second time, and Spurius\r\nRutilius Crassus being military tribunes with consular authority, and on\r\nthe following year Aulus Sempronius Atratinus a third time, and Marcus\r\nPapirius Mugillanus and Spurius Nautius Rutilus both a second time,\r\naffairs abroad were peaceable for two years, but at home there was\r\ndissension from the agrarian laws.\r\n\r\n48. The disturbers of the commons were Spurius Mæcilius a fourth time,\r\nand Spurius Mætilius a third time, tribunes of the people, both elected\r\nduring their absence. And after they had proposed a bill, that the land\r\ntaken from the enemy should be divided man by man, and the property of\r\na considerable part of the nobles would be confiscated by such a\r\nmeasure; for there was scarcely any of the land, considering the city\r\nitself was built on a strange soil, that had not been acquired by arms;\r\nnor had any other persons except the commons possession of that which\r\nhad been sold or publicly assigned, a violent contest between the\r\ncommons and patricians seemed to be at hand; nor did the military\r\ntribunes discover either in the senate, or in the private meetings of\r\nthe nobles, any line of conduct to pursue; when Appius Claudius, the\r\ngrandson of him who had been decemvir for compiling the laws, being the\r\nyoungest senator of the meeting, is stated to have said; \"that he\r\nbrought from home an old and a family scheme, for that his\r\ngreat-grandfather, Appius Claudius, had shown the patricians one method\r\nof baffling tribunitian power by the protests of their colleagues; that\r\nmen of low rank were easily led away from their opinions by the\r\ninfluence of men of distinction, if language were addressed to them\r\nsuitable to the times, rather than to the dignity of the speakers. That\r\ntheir sentiments were regulated by their circumstances. When they should\r\nsee that their colleagues, having the start in introducing the measure,\r\nhad engrossed to themselves the whole credit of it with the commons, and\r\nthat no room was left for them, that they would without reluctance\r\nincline to the interest of the senate, through which they may conciliate\r\nthe favour not only of the principal senators, but of the whole body.\"\r\nAll expressing their approbation, and above all, Quintius Servilius\r\nPriscus eulogizing the youth, because he had not degenerated from the\r\nClaudian race, a charge is given, that they should gain over as many of\r\nthe college of the tribunes as they could, to enter protests. On the\r\nbreaking up of the senate the tribunes are applied to by the leading\r\npatricians: by persuading, admonishing, and assuring them \"that it would\r\nbe gratefully felt by them individually, and gratefully by the entire\r\nsenate, they prevailed on six to give in their protests.\" And on the\r\nfollowing day, when the proposition was submitted to the senate, as had\r\nbeen preconcerted, concerning the sedition which Mæcilius and Mætilius\r\nwere exciting by urging a largess of a most mischievous precedent, such\r\nspeeches were delivered by the leading senators, that each declared\r\n\"that for his part he had no measure to advise, nor did he see any\r\nother resource in any thing, except in the aid of the tribunes. That to\r\nthe protection of that power the republic, embarrassed as it was, fled\r\nfor succour, just as a private individual in distress. That it was\r\nhighly honourable to themselves and to their office that there resided\r\nnot in the tribuneship more strength to harass the senate and to excite\r\ndisunion among the several orders, than to resist their perverse\r\ncolleagues.\" Then a shout arose throughout the entire senate, when the\r\ntribunes were appealed to from all parts of the house: then silence\r\nbeing established, those who had been prepared through the interest of\r\nthe leading men, declare that they will protest against the measure\r\nwhich had been proposed by their colleagues, and which the senate\r\nconsiders to tend to the dissolution of the state. Thanks were returned\r\nto the protestors by the senate. The movers of the law, having convened\r\na meeting, and styling their colleagues traitors to the interests of the\r\ncommons and the slaves of the consulars, and after inveighing against\r\nthem in other abusive language, relinquished the measure.\r\n\r\n49. The following year, on which Publius Cornelius Cossus, Caius\r\nValerius Potitus, Quintus Quintius Cincinnatus, Numerius Fabius\r\nVibulanus were military tribunes with consular power, would have brought\r\nwith it two continual wars, had not the Veientian campaign been deferred\r\nby the religious scruples of the leaders, whose lands were destroyed,\r\nchiefly by the ruin of the country-seats, in consequence of the Tiber\r\nhaving overflowed its banks. At the same time the loss sustained three\r\nyears before prevented the Æquans from affording assistance to the\r\nBolani, a state belonging to their own nation. Excursions had been made\r\nfrom thence on the contiguous territory of Lavici, and hostilities were\r\ncommitted on the new colony. As they had expected to be able to defend\r\nthis act of aggression by the concurrent support of all the Æquans, when\r\ndeserted by their friends they lost both their town and lands, after a\r\nwar not even worth mentioning, through a siege and one slight battle. An\r\nattempt made by Lucius Sextius, tribune of the people, to move a law by\r\nwhich colonists might be sent to Bolæ also, in like manner as to Lavici,\r\nwas defeated by the protests of his colleagues, who declared openly that\r\nthey would suffer no order of the commons to be passed, unless with the\r\napprobation of the senate. On the following year the Æquans, having\r\nrecovered Bolæ, and sent a colony thither, strengthened the town with\r\nadditional fortifications, the military tribunes with consular power at\r\nRome being Cneius Cornelius Cossus, Lucius Valerius Potitus, Quintus\r\nFabius Vibulanus a second time, Marcus Postumius Regillensis. The war\r\nagainst the Æquans was intrusted to the latter, a man of depraved mind,\r\nwhich victory manifested more effectually than war. For having with\r\ngreat activity levied an army and marched it to Bolæ, after breaking\r\ndown the spirits of the Æquans in slight engagements, he at length\r\nforced his way into the town. He then turned the contest from the enemy\r\nto his countrymen; and when during the assault he had proclaimed, that\r\nthe plunder should belong to the soldiers, after the town was taken he\r\nbroke his word. I am more inclined to believe that this was the cause of\r\nthe displeasure of the army, than that in a city lately sacked and in a\r\ncolony still young there was less booty found than the tribune had\r\nrepresented. An expression of his heard in the assembly, which was very\r\nsilly and almost insane, after he returned into the city on being sent\r\nfor on account of some tribunitian disturbances, increased this bad\r\nfeeling; on Sextus, a tribune of the commons, proposing an agrarian law,\r\nand at the same time declaring that he would also propose that colonists\r\nshould be sent to Bolæ; for that those who had taken them by their arms\r\nwere deserving that the city and lands of Bolæ should belong to them, he\r\nexclaimed, \"Woe to my soldiers, if they are not quiet;\" which words,\r\nwhen heard, gave not greater offence to the assembly, than they did soon\r\nafter to the patricians. And the plebeian tribune being a sharp man and\r\nby no means devoid of eloquence, having found among his adversaries this\r\nhaughty temper and unbridled tongue, which by irritating and exciting he\r\ncould urge into such expressions as might prove a source of odium not\r\nonly to himself, but to his cause and to the entire body, he strove to\r\ndraw Postumius into discussion more frequently than any of the college\r\nof military tribunes. Then indeed, after so brutal and inhuman an\r\nexpression, \"Romans,\" says he, \"do ye hear him threatening woe to his\r\nsoldiers as to slaves? Yet this brute will appear to you more deserving\r\nof so high an honour than those who send you into colonies, after having\r\ngranted to you cities and lands; who provide a settlement for your old\r\nage, who fight against such cruel and arrogant adversaries in defence\r\nof your interests. Begin then to wonder why few persons now undertake\r\nyour cause. What are they to expect from you? is it honours which you\r\ngive to your adversaries rather than to the champions of the Roman\r\npeople. You felt indignant just now, on hearing an expression of this\r\nman? What matters that, if you will prefer this man who threatens woe to\r\nyou, to those who are desirous to secure for you lands, settlements, and\r\nproperty?\"\r\n\r\n50. This expression of Postumius being conveyed to the soldiers, excited\r\nin the camp much greater indignation. \"Did the embezzler of the spoils\r\nand the defrauder threaten woe also to the soldiers?\" Accordingly, when\r\nthe murmur of indignation now became avowed, and the quæstor, Publius\r\nSestius, thought that the mutiny might be quashed by the same violence\r\nby which it had been excited; on his sending a lictor to one of the\r\nsoldiers who was clamorous, when a tumult and scuffle arose from the\r\ncircumstance, being struck with a stone he retired from the crowd; the\r\nperson who had given the blow, further observing with a sneer, \"That the\r\nquæstor got what the general had threatened to the soldiers.\" Postumius\r\nbeing sent for in consequence of the disturbance, exasperated every\r\nthing by the severity of his inquiries and the cruelty of his\r\npunishment. At last, when he set no bounds to his resentment, a crowd\r\ncollecting at the cries of those whom he had ordered to be put to death\r\nunder a hurdle, he himself madly ran down from his tribunal to those who\r\nwere interrupting the execution. There, when the lictors, endeavouring\r\nto disperse them, as also the centurions, irritated the crowd, their\r\nindignation burst forth to such a degree, that the military tribune was\r\noverwhelmed with stones by his own army. When an account was brought to\r\nRome of so heinous a deed, the military tribunes endeavouring to procure\r\na decree of the senate for an inquiry into the death of their colleague,\r\nthe tribunes of the people entered their protest. But that contention\r\nbranched out of another subject of dispute; because the patricians had\r\nbecome uneasy lest the commons, through dread of the inquiries and\r\nthrough resentment, might elect military tribunes from their own body:\r\nand they strove with all their might that consuls should be elected.\r\nWhen the plebeian tribunes did not suffer the decree of the senate to\r\npass, and when they also protested against the election of consuls, the\r\naffair was brought to an interregnum. The victory was then on the side\r\nof the patricians.\r\n\r\n51. Quintus Fabius Vibulanus, interrex, presiding in the assembly, Aulus\r\nCornelius Cossus, Lucius Furius Medullinus were elected consuls. During\r\ntheir office, at the commencement of the year, a decree of the senate\r\nwas passed that the tribunes should, at the earliest opportunity,\r\npropose to the commons an inquiry into the murder of Postumius, and that\r\nthe commons should appoint whomsoever they thought proper to conduct the\r\ninquiry. The office is intrusted to the consuls by the commons with the\r\nconsent of the people at large, who, after having executed the task with\r\nthe utmost moderation and lenity by punishing only a few, who there are\r\nsufficient grounds for believing put a period to their own lives, still\r\ncould not succeed so as to prevent the people from feeling the utmost\r\ndispleasure. \"That constitutions, which were enacted for their\r\nadvantages, lay so long unexecuted; while a law passed in the mean time\r\nregarding their blood and punishment was instantly put into execution\r\nand possessed full force.\" This was a most seasonable time, after the\r\npunishment of the mutiny, that the division of the territory of Bolæ\r\nshould be presented as a soother to their minds; by which proceeding\r\nthey would have diminished their eagerness for an agrarian law, which\r\ntended to expel the patricians from the public land unjustly possessed\r\nby them. Then this very indignity exasperated their minds, that the\r\nnobility persisted not only in retaining the public lands, which they\r\ngot possession of by force, but would not even distribute to the commons\r\nthe unoccupied land lately taken from the enemy, and which would, like\r\nthe rest, soon become the prey of a few. The same year the legions were\r\nled out by the consul Furius against the Volscians, who were ravaging\r\nthe country of the Hernicians, and finding no enemy there, they took\r\nFerentinum, whither a great multitude of the Volscians had betaken\r\nthemselves. There was less plunder than they had expected; because the\r\nVolscians, seeing small hopes of keeping it, carried off their effects\r\nand abandoned the town. It was taken on the following day, being nearly\r\ndeserted. The land itself was given to the Hernicians.\r\n\r\n52. The year, tranquil through the moderation of the tribunes, was\r\nsucceeded by one in which Lucius Icilius was plebeian tribune, Quintus\r\nFabius Ambustus, Caius Furius Pacilus being consuls. When this man, at\r\nthe very commencement of the year, began to excite disturbances by the\r\npublication of agrarian laws, as if such was the task of his name and\r\nfamily, a pestilence broke out, more alarming however than deadly, which\r\ndiverted men's thoughts from the forum and political disputes to their\r\ndomestic concerns and the care of their personal health; and persons\r\nthink that it was less mischievous than the disturbance would have\r\nproved. The state being freed from this (which was attended) with a very\r\ngeneral spread of illness, though very few deaths, the year of\r\npestilence was followed by a scarcity of grain, the cultivation of the\r\nland having been neglected, as usually happens, Marcus Papirius\r\nAtratinus, Caius Nautius Rutilus being consuls. The famine would now\r\nhave proved more dismal than the pestilence, had not the scarcity been\r\nrelieved by sending envoys around all the states, which border on the\r\nTuscan Sea and the Tiber, to purchase the corn. The envoys were\r\nprevented from trading in an insolent manner by the Samnitians, who were\r\nin possession of Capua and Cumæ; on the contrary, they were kindly\r\nassisted by the tyrants of Sicily. The Tiber brought down the greatest\r\nsupplies, through the very active zeal of the Etrurians. In consequence\r\nof the sickness, the consuls laboured under a paucity of hands in\r\nconducting the government; when not finding more than one senator for\r\neach embassy, they were obliged to attach to it two knights. Except from\r\nthe pestilence and the scarcity, there was no internal or external\r\nannoyance during those two years. But as soon as these causes of anxiety\r\ndisappeared, all those evils by which the state had hitherto been\r\ndistressed, started up, discord at home, war abroad.\r\n\r\n53. In the consulship of Mamercus Æmilius and Caius Valerius Potitus,\r\nthe Æquans made preparations for war; the Volscians, though not by\r\npublic authority, taking up arms, and entering the service as volunteers\r\nfor pay. When on the report of these enemies having started up, (for\r\nthey had now passed into the Latin and Hernican land,) Marcus Mænius, a\r\nproposer of an agrarian law, would obstruct Valerius the consul when\r\nholding a levy, and when no one took the military oath against his own\r\nwill under the protection of the tribune; an account is suddenly brought\r\nthat the citadel of Carventa had been seized by the enemy. The disgrace\r\nincurred by this event was both a source of odium to Mænius in the hands\r\nof the fathers, and it moreover afforded to the other tribunes, already\r\npre-engaged as protestors against an agrarian law, a more justifiable\r\npretext for resisting their colleague. Wherefore after the matter had\r\nbeen protracted for a long time by wrangling, the consuls calling gods\r\nand men to witness, that whatever disgrace or loss had either been\r\nalready sustained or hung over them from the enemy, the blame of it\r\nwould be imputed to Mænius, who hindered the levy; Mænius, on the other\r\nhand, exclaiming \"that if the unjust occupiers would yield up possession\r\nof the public land, he would cause no delay to the levy:\" the nine\r\ntribunes interposing a decree, put an end to the contest; and they\r\nproclaimed as the determination of their college, \"that they would, for\r\nthe purposes of the levy, in opposition to the protest of their\r\ncolleague, afford their aid to Caius Valerius the consul in inflicting\r\nfines and other penalties on those who refused to enlist.\" When the\r\nconsul, armed with this decree, ordered into prison a few who appealed\r\nto the tribune, the rest took the military oath from fear. The army was\r\nmarched to the citadel of Carventa, and though hated by and disliking\r\nthe consul, they on their first arrival recovered the citadel in a\r\nspirited manner, having dislodged those who were protecting it; some in\r\nquest of plunder having straggled away through carelessness from the\r\ngarrison, afforded an opportunity for attacking them. There was\r\nconsiderable booty from the constant devastations, because all had been\r\ncollected into a safe place. This the consul ordered the quæstors to\r\nsell by auction and carry it into the treasury, declaring that the army\r\nshould then participate in the booty, when they had not declined the\r\nservice. The exasperation of the commons and soldiers against the consul\r\nwas then augmented. Accordingly, when by a decree of the senate the\r\nconsul entered the city in an ovation, rude verses in couplets were\r\nthrown out with military licence; in which the consul was severely\r\nhandled, whilst the name of Mænius was cried up with encomiums, when at\r\nevery mention of the tribune the attachment of the surrounding people\r\nvied by their applause and commendation with the loud praises of the\r\nsoldiers. And that circumstance occasioned more anxiety to the\r\npatricians, than the wanton raillery of the soldiers against the\r\nconsul, which was in a manner a usual thing; and the election of Mænius\r\namong the military tribunes being deemed as no longer questionable, if\r\nhe should become a candidate, he was kept out of it by an election for\r\nconsuls being appointed.\r\n\r\n54. Cneius Cornelius Cossus and Lucius Furius Medullinus were elected\r\nconsuls. The commons were not on any other occasion more dissatisfied at\r\nthe election of tribunes not being conceded to them. This sense of\r\nannoyance they both manifested at the nomination of quæstors, and\r\navenged by then electing plebeians for the first time as quæstors; so\r\nthat in electing four, room was left for only one patrician; whilst\r\nthree plebeians, Quintus Silius, Publius Aelius, and Publius Pupius,\r\nwere preferred to young men of the most illustrious families. I learn\r\nthat the principal advisers of the people, in this so independent a\r\nbestowing of their suffrage, were the Icilii, three out of this family\r\nmost hostile to the patricians having been elected tribunes of the\r\ncommons for that year, by their holding out the grand prospect of many\r\nand great achievements to the people, who became consequently most\r\nardent; after they had affirmed that they would not stir a step, if the\r\npeople would not, even at the election of quæstors, the only one which\r\nthe senate had left open to the commons and patricians, evince\r\nsufficient spirit to accomplish that which they had so long wished for,\r\nand which was allowed by the laws. This therefore the people considered\r\nan important victory; and that quæstorship they estimated not by the\r\nextent of the honour itself; but an access seemed opened to new men to\r\nthe consulship and the honours of a triumph. The patricians, on the\r\nother hand, expressed their indignation not so much at the honours of\r\nthe state being shared, but at their being lost; they said that, \"if\r\nmatters be so, children need no longer be educated; who being driven\r\nfrom the station of their ancestors, and seeing others in the possession\r\nof their dignity, would be left without command or power, as mere salii\r\nand flamens, with no other employment than to offer sacrifices for the\r\npeople.\" The minds of both parties being irritated, since the commons\r\nhad both assumed new courage, and had now three leaders of the most\r\ndistinguished reputation for the popular side; the patricians seeing\r\nthat the result of all the elections would be similar to that for\r\nquæstors, wherever the people had the choice from both sides, strove\r\nvigorously for the election of consuls, which was not yet open to them.\r\nThe Icilii, on the contrary, said that military tribunes should be\r\nelected, and that posts of honour should be at length imparted to the\r\ncommons.\r\n\r\n55. But the consuls had no proceeding on hand, by opposing which they\r\ncould extort that which they desired; when by an extraordinary and\r\nfavourable occurrence an account is brought that the Volscians and\r\nÆquans had proceeded beyond their frontiers into the Latin and Hernican\r\nterritory to commit depredations. For which war when the consuls\r\ncommence to hold a levy in pursuance of a decree of the senate, the\r\ntribunes then strenuously opposed them, affirming that such a fortunate\r\nopportunity was presented to them and to the commons. There were three,\r\nand all very active men, and of respectable families, considering they\r\nwere plebeians. Two of them choose each a consul, to be watched by them\r\nwith unremitting assiduity; to one is assigned the charge sometimes of\r\nrestraining, sometimes of exciting, the commons by his harangues.\r\nNeither the consuls effected the levy, nor the tribunes the election\r\nwhich they desired. Then fortune inclining to the cause of the people,\r\nexpresses arrive that the Æquans had attacked the citadel of Carventa,\r\nthe soldiers who were in garrison having straggled away in quest of\r\nplunder, and had put to death the few left to guard it; that others were\r\nslain as they were returning to the citadel, and others who were\r\ndispersed through the country. This circumstance, prejudicial to the\r\nstate, added force to the project of the tribunes. For, assailed by\r\nevery argument to no purpose that they would then at length desist from\r\nobstructing the war, when they yielded neither to the public storm, nor\r\nto the odium themselves, they succeed so far as to have a decree of the\r\nsenate passed for the election of military tribunes; with an express\r\nstipulation, however, that no candidate should be considered, who was\r\ntribune of the people that year, and that no one should be re-elected\r\nplebeian tribune for the year following; the senate undoubtedly pointing\r\nat the Icilians, whom they suspected of aiming at the consular\r\ntribuneship as the reward of their turbulent tribuneship of the commons.\r\nThen the levy began to proceed, and preparations for war began to be\r\nmade with the concurrence of all ranks. The diversity of the statements\r\nof writers leaves it uncertain whether both the consuls set out for the\r\ncitadel of Carventa, or whether one remained behind to hold the\r\nelections; those facts in which they do not disagree are to be received\r\nas certain, that they retired from the citadel of Carventa, after having\r\ncarried on the attack for a long time to no purpose: that Verrugo in the\r\nVolscian country was taken by the same army, and that great devastation\r\nhad been made, and considerable booty captured both amongst the Æquans\r\nand in the Volscian territory.\r\n\r\n56. At Rome, as the commons gained the victory so far as to have the\r\nkind of elections which they preferred, so in the issue of the elections\r\nthe patricians were victorious; for, contrary to the expectation of all,\r\nthree patricians were elected military tribunes with consular power,\r\nCaius Julius Julus, Publius Cornelius Cossus, Caius Servilius Ahala.\r\nThey say that an artifice was employed by the patricians (with which the\r\nIcilii charged them even at the time); that by intermixing a crowd of\r\nunworthy candidates with the deserving, they turned away the thoughts of\r\nthe people from the plebeian through the disgust excited by the\r\nremarkable meanness of some. Then tidings are brought that the Volscians\r\nand Æquans, whether the retention of the citadel of Carventa raised\r\ntheir hopes, or the loss of the garrison at Verrugo excited their\r\nresentment, united in making preparations for war with the utmost\r\nenergy: that the Antians were the chief promoters of the project; that\r\ntheir ambassadors had gone about the states of both these nations,\r\nupbraiding their dastardly conduct; that shut up within their walls,\r\nthey had on the preceding year suffered the Romans to carry their\r\ndepredations throughout their country, and the garrison of Verrugo to be\r\noverpowered. That now not only armed troops but colonies also were sent\r\ninto their territories; and that not only the Romans distributed among\r\nthemselves and kept their property, but that they had made a present to\r\nthe Hernici of Ferentinum what had been taken from them. After their\r\nminds were inflamed by these remonstrances, according as they made\r\napplications to each, a great number of young men were enlisted. Thus\r\nthe youth of all the states were drawn together to Antium: there they\r\npitched their camp and awaited the enemy. When these accounts are\r\nreported at Rome with much greater alarm than the circumstance\r\nwarranted, the senate instantly ordered a dictator to be nominated,\r\nwhich was their last resource in perilous circumstances. They say that\r\nJulius and Cornelius were much offended at this proceeding, and that the\r\nmatter was accomplished with great warmth of temper: when the leading\r\nmen of the patricians, complaining fruitlessly that the military\r\ntribunes would not conform to the judgment of the senate, at last\r\nappealed even to the tribunes of the commons, and stated that force had\r\nbeen used even with the consuls by that body on a similar occasion. The\r\nplebeian tribunes, overjoyed at the dissension among the patricians,\r\nsaid, \"that there was no support in persons who were not held in the\r\nrank of citizens, nor even of human beings; if ever the posts of honour\r\nwere open, and the administration of government were shared, that they\r\nshould then see that the decrees of the senate should not be invalidated\r\nby the arrogance of magistrates; that in the mean while, the patricians,\r\nunrestrained as they were by respect for laws or magistrates, must\r\nmanage the tribunitian office also by themselves.\"\r\n\r\n57. This contention occupied men's thoughts at a most unseasonable time,\r\nwhen a war of such importance was on hand: until when Julius and\r\nCornelius descanted for a long time by turns, on \"how unjust it was that\r\na post of honour conferred on them by the people was now to be wrested\r\nfrom them, since they were generals sufficiently qualified to conduct\r\nthat war.\" Then Ahala Servilius, military tribune, says, \"that he had\r\nremained silent for so long a time, not because he was uncertain as to\r\nhis opinion, (for what good citizen can separate his own interests from\r\nthose of the public,) but because he wished that his colleagues should\r\nof their own accord yield to the authority of the senate, rather than\r\nsuffer the tribunitian power to be suppliantly appealed to against them.\r\nThat even then, if circumstances permitted, he would still give them\r\ntime to retract an opinion too pertinaciously adhered to. But since the\r\nexigences of war do not await the counsels of men, that the public weal\r\nwas of deeper importance to him than the good will of his colleagues,\r\nand if the senate continued in the same sentiments, he would, on the\r\nfollowing night, nominate a dictator; and if any one protested against a\r\ndecree of the senate being passed, that he would be content with its\r\nauthority.\"[158] When by this conduct he bore away the well-merited\r\npraises and good will of all, having named Publius Cornelius dictator,\r\nhe himself being appointed by him as master of the horse, served as an\r\ninstance to those who considered his case and that of his colleagues,\r\nhow much more attainable public favour and honour sometimes were to\r\nthose who evinced no desire for them. The war was in no respect a\r\nmemorable one. The enemy were beaten at Antium in one, and that an easy\r\nbattle; the victorious army laid waste the Volscian territory; their\r\nfort at the lake Fucinus was taken by storm, and in it three thousand\r\nmen made prisoners; the rest of the Volscians being driven within the\r\nwalls, and not defending the lands. The dictator having conducted the\r\nwar in such a manner as to show that he was not negligent of fortune's\r\nfavours, returned to the city with a greater share of success than of\r\nglory, and resigned his office. The military tribunes, without making\r\nany mention of an election of consuls, (through pique, I suppose, for\r\nthe appointment of a dictator,) issued a proclamation for the election\r\nof military tribunes. Then indeed the perplexity of the patricians\r\nbecame still greater, as seeing their cause betrayed by their own party.\r\nWherefore, as on the year before, by bringing forward as candidates the\r\nmost unworthy individuals from amongst the plebeians, they produced a\r\ndisgust against all, even those who were deserving; so then by engaging\r\nsuch of the patricians as were most distinguished by the splendour of\r\ntheir character and by their influence to stand as candidates, they\r\nsecured all the places; so that no plebeian could get in. Four were\r\nelected, all of them men who had already served the office, Lucius\r\nFurius Medullinus, Caius Valerius Potitus, Numerius Fabius Vibulanus,\r\nCaius Servilius Ahala. The last had the honour continued to him by\r\nre-election, as well in consequence of his other deserts, as on account\r\nof his recent popularity, acquired by his singular moderation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 158: The passing of a _senatus-consultum_, or decree of the\r\nsenate, might be prevented in several ways; as, for instance, by the\r\nwant of a sufficiently full meeting, &c.; in such cases the judgment of\r\nthe majority was recorded, and that was called _auctoritas senatûs_.]\r\n\r\n58. In that year, because the term of the truce with the Veientian\r\nnation was expired, restitution began to be demanded through ambassadors\r\nand heralds, who on coming to the frontiers were met by an embassy from\r\nthe Veientians. They requested that they would not proceed to Veii,\r\nuntil they should first have access to the Roman senate. They obtained\r\nfrom the senate, that, because the Veientians were distressed by\r\nintestine dissension, restitution would not be demanded from them; so\r\nfar were they from seeking, in the troubles of others, an opportunity\r\nfor advancing their own interest. In the Volscian territory also a\r\ndisaster was sustained in the loss of the garrison at Verrugo; where so\r\nmuch depended on time, that when the soldiers who were besieged there,\r\nand were calling for succour, might have been relieved, if expedition\r\nhad been used, the army sent to their aid only came in time to surprise\r\nthe enemy, who were straggling in quest of plunder, just after their\r\nputting [the garrison] to the sword. The cause of the dilatoriness was\r\nless referrible to the tribunes than to the senate, who, because word\r\nwas brought that they were holding out with the most vigorous\r\nresistance, did not duly reflect that there is a limit to human\r\nstrength, which no bravery can exceed. These very gallant soldiers,\r\nhowever, were not without revenge, both before and after their death. In\r\nthe following year, Publius and Cneius Cornelius Cossus, Numerius Fabius\r\nAmbustus, and Lucius Valerius Potitus, being military tribunes with\r\nconsular power, the Veientian war was commenced on account of an\r\ninsolent answer of the Veientian senate, who, when the ambassadors\r\ndemanded restitution, ordered them to be told, that if they did not\r\nspeedily quit the city and the territories, they should give them what\r\nLars Tolumnius had given them. The senate, indignant at this, decreed\r\nthat the military tribunes should, on as early a day as possible,\r\npropose to the people the proclaiming war against the Veientians. When\r\nthis was first made public, the young men expressed their\r\ndissatisfaction. \"That the war with the Volscians was not yet over; that\r\na little time ago two garrisons were utterly destroyed, and that [one of\r\nthe forts] was with great risk retained. That there was not a year in\r\nwhich they had not to fight in the field: and, as if they were\r\ndissatisfied at the insufficiency of these toils, a new war was now set\r\non foot with a neighbouring and most powerful nation, who were likely to\r\nrouse all Etruria.\" These discontents, first discussed among themselves,\r\nwere further aggravated by the plebeian tribunes. These constantly\r\naffirm that the war of the greatest moment was that between the\r\npatricians and commons. That the latter was designedly harassed by\r\nmilitary service, and exposed to be butchered by the enemy; that they\r\nwere kept at a distance from the enemy, and as it were banished, lest\r\nduring the enjoyment of rest at home, mindful of liberty and of\r\nestablishing colonies, they may form plans for obtaining some of the\r\npublic land, or for giving their suffrages freely; and taking hold of\r\nthe veterans, they recounted the campaigns of each, and their wounds and\r\nscars, frequently asking what sound spot was there on their body for the\r\nreception of new wounds? what blood had they remaining which could be\r\nshed for the commonwealth? When by discussing these subjects in private\r\nconversations, and also in public harangues, they produced in the people\r\nan aversion to undertaking a war, the time for proposing the law was\r\nadjourned; which would obviously have been rejected, if it had been\r\nsubjected to the feeling of discontent then prevailing.\r\n\r\n59. In the mean time it was determined that the military tribunes should\r\nlead an army into the Volscian territory. Cneius Cornelius alone was\r\nleft at Rome. The three tribunes, when it became evident that the\r\nVolscians had not established a camp any where, and that they would not\r\nventure an engagement, separated into three different parties to lay\r\nwaste the country. Valerius makes for Antium, Cornelius for Ecetræ.\r\nWherever they came, they committed extensive devastations on the houses\r\nand lands, so as to separate the Volscians: Fabius, without committing\r\nany devastation, proceeded to attack Auxur, which was a principal object\r\nin view. Auxur is the town now called Tarracinæ; a city built on a\r\ndeclivity leading to a morass: Fabius made a feint of attacking it on\r\nthat side. When four cohorts sent round under Caius Servilius Ahala took\r\npossession of a hill which commanded the city, they attacked the walls\r\nwith a loud shout and tumult, from the higher ground where there was no\r\nguard of defence. Those who were defending the lower parts of the city\r\nagainst Fabius, astounded at this tumult, afforded him an opportunity of\r\napplying the scaling ladders, and every place soon became filled with\r\nthe enemy, and a dreadful slaughter continued for a long time,\r\nindiscriminately of those who fled and those who resisted, of the armed\r\nor unarmed. The vanquished were therefore obliged to fight, there being\r\nno hope for those who gave way, when a proclamation suddenly issued,\r\nthat no persons except those with arms in their hands should be injured,\r\ninduced all the remaining multitude voluntarily to lay down their arms;\r\nof whom two thousand five hundred are taken alive. Fabius kept his\r\nsoldiers from the spoil, until his colleagues should come; affirming\r\nthat Auxur had been taken by these armies also, who had diverted the\r\nother Volscian troops from the defence of that place. When they came,\r\nthe three armies plundered the town, which was enriched with wealth of\r\nmany years' accumulation; and this generosity of the commanders first\r\nreconciled the commons to the patricians. It was afterwards added, by a\r\nliberality towards the people on the part of the leading men the most\r\nseasonable ever shown, that before any mention should be made of it by\r\nthe commons or tribunes, the senate should decree that the soldiers\r\nshould receive pay out of the public treasury, whereas up to that period\r\nevery one had discharged that duty at his own expense.\r\n\r\n60. It is recorded that nothing was ever received by the commons with so\r\nmuch joy; that they ran in crowds to the senate-house, and caught the\r\nhands of those coming out, and called them fathers indeed; acknowledging\r\nthat the result of such conduct was that no one would spare his person\r\nor his blood, whilst he had any strength remaining, in defence of a\r\ncountry so liberal. Whilst the prospect of advantage pleased them, that\r\ntheir private property should remain unimpaired at the time during which\r\ntheir bodies should be devoted and employed for the interest of the\r\ncommonwealth, it further increased their joy very much, and rendered\r\ntheir gratitude for the favour more complete, because it had been\r\noffered to them voluntarily, without ever having been agitated by the\r\ntribunes of the commons, or made the subject of a demand in their own\r\nconversations. The tribunes of the commons, the only parties who did not\r\nparticipate in the general joy and harmony prevailing through the\r\ndifferent ranks, denied \"that this measure would prove so much a matter\r\nof joy, or so honourable to the patricians,[159] as they themselves\r\nmight imagine. That the measure at first sight was better than it would\r\nprove by experience. For from what source was that money to be raised,\r\nexcept by levying a tax on the people. That they were generous to some\r\ntherefore at the expense of others; and even though others may endure\r\nit, those who had already served out their time in the service, would\r\nnever endure that others should serve on better terms than they\r\nthemselves had served; and that these same individuals should have to\r\nbear the expense of their own service, and then that of others.\" By\r\nthese arguments they influenced a part of the commons. At last, when the\r\ntax was now announced, the tribunes publicly declared, that they would\r\nafford protection to any one who should refuse to contribute his\r\nproportion for the pay of the soldiers. The patricians persisted in\r\nsupporting a matter so happily commenced. They themselves were the first\r\nto contribute; and because there was as yet no coined silver, some of\r\nthem conveying their weighed brass to the treasury in waggons, rendered\r\ntheir contribution very showy. After the senate had contributed with the\r\nutmost punctuality according to their rated properties, the principal\r\nplebeians, friends of the nobility, according to a concerted plan, began\r\nto contribute. And when the populace saw these men highly applauded by\r\nthe patricians, and also looked up to as good citizens by men of the\r\nmilitary age, scorning the support of the tribunes, an emulation\r\ncommenced at once about paying the tax. And the law being passed about\r\ndeclaring war against the Veientians, the new military tribunes with\r\nconsular power marched to Veii an army consisting in a great measure of\r\nvolunteers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 159: The reading of the original here is decidedly incorrect.\r\nVarious emendations have been attempted, but none can be deemed\r\nsatisfactory.]\r\n\r\n61. The tribunes were Titus Quintius Capitolinus, Publius Quintius\r\nCincinnatus, Caius Julius Julus a second time, Aulus Manlius, Lucius\r\nFurius Medullinus a second time, and Manius Æmilius Mamercinus. By these\r\nVeii was first invested. A little before the commencement of this siege,\r\nwhen a full meeting of the Etrurians was held at the temple of Voltumna,\r\nit was not finally determined whether the Veientians were to be\r\nsupported by the public concurrence of the whole confederacy. The siege\r\nwas less vigorous in the following year, some of the tribunes and their\r\narmy being called off to the Volscian war. The military tribunes with\r\nconsular power in this year were Caius Valerius Potitus a third time,\r\nManius Largius Fidenas, Publius Cornelius Maluginensis, Cneius Cornelius\r\nCossus, Kæso Fabius Ambustus, Spurius Nautius Rutilus a second time. A\r\npitched battle was fought with the Volscians between Ferentinum and\r\nEcetra; the result of the battle was favourable to the Romans. Artena\r\nthen, a town of the Volscians, began to be besieged by the tribunes.\r\nThence during an attempt at a sally, the enemy being driven back into\r\nthe town, an opportunity was afforded to the Romans of forcing in; and\r\nevery place was taken except the citadel. Into the fortress, well\r\nprotected by nature, a body of armed men retired. Beneath the fortress\r\nmany were slain and made prisoners. The citadel was then besieged; nor\r\ncould it either be taken by storm, because it had a garrison sufficient\r\nfor the size of the place, nor did it hold out any hope of surrender,\r\nall the public corn having been conveyed to the citadel before the city\r\nwas taken; and they would have retired from it, being wearied out, had\r\nnot a slave betrayed the fortress to the Romans: the soldiers being\r\nadmitted by him through a place difficult of access, took it; by whom\r\nwhen the guards were being killed, the rest of the multitude,\r\noverpowered with sudden panic, surrendered. After demolishing both the\r\ncitadel and city of Artena, the legions were led back from the Volscian\r\nterritory; and the whole Roman power was turned against Veii. To the\r\ntraitor, besides his freedom, the property of two families was given as\r\na reward. His name was Servius Romanus. There are some who think that\r\nArtena belonged to the Veientians, not to the Volscians. What occasions\r\nthe mistake is that there was a city of the same name between Cære and\r\nVeii. But the Roman kings destroyed it; and it belonged to the\r\nCæretians, not to the Veientians. The other of the same name, the\r\ndemolition of which has been mentioned, was in the Volscian territory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _During the siege of Veii winter dwellings erected for the\r\n     soldiers. This being a novelty, affords the tribunes of the people\r\n     a pretext for exciting discontent. The cavalry for the first time\r\n     serve on horses of their own. Furius Camillus, dictator, takes Veii\r\n     after a siege of ten years. In the character of military tribune,\r\n     whilst laying siege to Falisci, he sends back the children of the\r\n     enemy, who were betrayed into his hands. Furius Camillus, on a day\r\n     being appointed for his trial, goes into exile. The Senonian Gauls\r\n     lay siege to Clusium. Roman ambassadors, sent to mediate peace\r\n     between the Clusians and Gauls, are found to take part with the\r\n     former; in consequence of which the Gauls march directly against\r\n     Rome, and after defeating the Romans at Allia take possession of\r\n     the city with the exception of the Capitol. They scaled the Capitol\r\n     by night, but are discovered by the cackling of geese, and\r\n     repulsed, chiefly by the exertions of Marcus Manlius. The Romans,\r\n     compelled by famine, agree to ransom themselves. Whilst the gold is\r\n     being weighed to them, Camillus, who had been appointed dictator,\r\n     arrives with an army, expels the Gauls, and destroys their army. He\r\n     successfully opposes the design of removing to Veii._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Peace being established in every other quarter, the Romans and\r\nVeientians were still in arms with such rancour and animosity, that it\r\nwas evident that ruin awaited the vanquished party. The elections in the\r\ntwo states were conducted in very different methods. The Romans\r\naugmented the number of military tribunes with consular power. Eight, a\r\nnumber greater than on any previous occasion, were appointed, Manius\r\nÆmilius Mamercinus a second time, Lucius Valerius Potitus a third time,\r\nAppius Claudius Crassus, Marcus Quintilius Varus, Lucius Julius Iulus,\r\nMarcus Postumius, Marcus Furius Camillus, Marcus Postumius Albinus. The\r\nVeientians, on the contrary, through disgust at the annual intriguing\r\nwhich was sometimes the cause of dissensions, elected a king. That step\r\ngave offence to the feelings of the states of Etruria, not more from\r\ntheir hatred of kingly government than of the king himself. He had\r\nbefore this become obnoxious to the nation by reason of his wealth and\r\narrogance, because he had violently broken off the performance of some\r\nannual games, the omission of which was deemed an impiety: when through\r\nresentment of a repulse, because another had been preferred to him as a\r\npriest by the suffrages of the twelve states, he suddenly carried off,\r\nin the middle of the performance, the performers, of whom a great part\r\nwere his own slaves. The nation, therefore, devoted beyond all others to\r\nreligious performances, because they excelled in the method of\r\nconducting them, passed a decree that aid should be refused to the\r\nVeientians, as long as they should be subject to a king. All allusion to\r\nthis decree was suppressed at Veii through fear of the king, who would\r\nhave considered the person by whom any such matter might be mentioned as\r\na leader of sedition, not as the author of an idle rumour. Although\r\nmatters were announced to the Romans as being quiet in Etruria, yet\r\nbecause it was stated that this matter was being agitated in all their\r\nmeetings, they so managed their fortifications, that there should be\r\nsecurity on both sides; some were directed towards the city and the\r\nsallies of the townsmen; by means of others a front looking towards\r\nEtruria was opposed to such auxiliaries as might happen to come from\r\nthence.\r\n\r\n2. When the Roman generals conceived greater hopes from a blockade than\r\nfrom an assault, winter huts also, a thing quite new to the Roman\r\nsoldier, began to be built; and their determination was to continue the\r\nwar by wintering there. After an account of this was brought to Rome to\r\nthe tribunes of the people, who for a long time past had found no\r\npretext for exciting disturbances, they run forward into the assembly,\r\nstir up the minds of the commons, saying that \"this was the motive for\r\nwhich pay had been established for the soldiers, nor had it escaped\r\ntheir knowledge, that such a present from the enemies was tainted with\r\npoison. That the liberty of the commons had been sold; that their youth\r\nremoved for ever, and exiled from the city and the republic, did not now\r\neven yield to the winter and to the season of the year, and visit their\r\nhomes and private affairs. What could they suppose was the cause for\r\ncontinuing the service without intermission? That undoubtedly they\r\nshould find none other than [the fear] lest any thing might be done in\r\nfurtherance of their interests by the attendance of those youths in\r\nwhom the entire strength of the commons lay. Besides that they were\r\nharassed and worked much more severely than the Veientians. For the\r\nlatter spent the winter beneath their own roofs, defending their city by\r\nstrong walls and its natural situation, whilst the Roman soldier, in the\r\nmidst of toil and hardship, continued beneath the covering of skins,\r\noverwhelmed with snow and frost, not laying aside his arms even during\r\nthe period of winter, which is a respite from all wars by land and sea.\r\nNeither kings, nor those consuls, tyrannical as they were before the\r\ninstitution of the tribunitian office, nor the stern authority of the\r\ndictator, nor the overbearing decemvirs, ever imposed such slavery as\r\nthat they should perform unremitting military service, which degree of\r\nregal power the military tribunes now exercised over the Roman commons.\r\nWhat would these men have done as consuls or dictators, who have\r\nexhibited the picture of the proconsular office so implacable and\r\nmenacing? but that all this happened justly. Among eight military\r\ntribunes there was no room even for one plebeian. Formerly the\r\npatricians filled up three places with the utmost difficulty; now they\r\nwent in file eight deep to take possession of the various offices; and\r\nnot even in such a crowd is any plebeian intermixed; who, if he did no\r\nother good, might remind his colleagues, that it was freemen and fellow\r\ncitizens, and not slaves, that constituted the army, who ought to be\r\nbrought back during winter at least to their homes and roofs; and to\r\ncome and see at some part of the year their parents, children, and\r\nwives, and to exercise the rights of freedom, and to take part in\r\nelecting magistrates.\" While they exclaimed in these and such terms,\r\nthey found in Appius Claudius an opponent not unequal to them, who had\r\nbeen left behind by his colleagues to check the turbulence of the\r\ntribunes; a man trained even from his youth in contests with the\r\nplebeians; who several year's before, as has been mentioned, recommended\r\nthe dissolution of the tribunitian power by means of the protests of\r\ntheir colleagues.\r\n\r\n3. He, not only endowed with good natural powers, but well trained also\r\nby experience, on that particular occasion, delivered the following\r\naddress: \"If, Romans, there was ever reason to doubt, whether the\r\ntribunes of the people have ever promoted sedition for your sake or\r\ntheir own, I am certain that in the course of this year that doubt must\r\nhave ceased to exist; and while I rejoice that an end has at length come\r\nof a mistake of such long continuance, I in the next place congratulate\r\nyou, and on your account the republic, that this delusion has been\r\nremoved during a course of prosperous events. Is there any person who\r\ncan feel a doubt that the tribunes of the commons were never so highly\r\ndispleased and provoked by any wrongs done to you, if ever such did\r\nhappen, as by the munificence of the patricians to the commons, when pay\r\nwas established for those serving in the army. What else do you suppose\r\nthat they either then dreaded, or now wish to disturb, except the union\r\nbetween the orders, which they think contributes most to the dissolution\r\nof the tribunitian power? Thus, by Jove, like workers in iniquity, they\r\nare seeking for work, who also wish that there should be always some\r\ndiseased part in the republic, that there may be something for the cure\r\nof which they may be employed by you. For, [tribunes,] whether do you\r\ndefend or attack the commons? whether are you the enemies of those in\r\nthe service, or do you plead their cause? Unless perhaps you say,\r\nwhatever the patricians do, displeases us; whether it is for the\r\ncommons, or against the commons; and just as masters forbid their slaves\r\nto have any dealing with those belonging to others, and deem it right\r\nthat they should equally refrain from having any commerce with them,\r\neither for kindness or unkindness; ye, in like manner, interdict us the\r\npatricians from all intercourse with the people, lest by our\r\ncourteousness and munificence we may challenge their regard, and they\r\nbecome tractable and obedient to our direction. And if there were in you\r\nany thing of the feeling, I say not of fellow-citizens, but of human\r\nbeings, how much more ought you to favour, and, as far as in you lay, to\r\npromote rather the kindly demeanour of the patricians and the\r\ntractability of the commons! And if such concord were once permanent,\r\nwho would not venture to engage, that this empire would in a short time\r\nbecome the highest among the neighbouring states?\r\n\r\n4. \"I shall hereafter explain to you how not only expedient, but even\r\nnecessary has been this plan of my colleagues, according to which they\r\nwould not draw off the army from Veii until the business has been\r\ncompleted. For the present I am disposed to speak concerning the\r\ncondition of the soldiers. Which observations of mine I think would\r\nappear reasonable not only before you, but even, if they were delivered\r\nin the camp, in the opinion of the soldiers themselves; on which subject\r\nif nothing could suggest itself to my own mind to say, I certainly\r\nshould be satisfied with that which is suggested by the arguments of my\r\nadversaries. They lately said, that pay should not be given to the\r\nsoldiers because it had never been given. How then can they now feel\r\ndispleased, that additional labour should be imposed in due proportion\r\non those to whom some addition of profit has been added? In no case is\r\nthere either labour without emolument, nor emolument in general without\r\nthe expense of labour. Toil and pleasure, in their natures most unlike,\r\nare yet linked together by a sort of natural connexion. Formerly the\r\nsoldier thought it a hardship that he gave his labour to the\r\ncommonwealth at his own expense; at the same time he was glad for a part\r\nof the year to till his own ground; to acquire that means whence he\r\nmight support himself and family at home and in war. Now he feels a\r\npleasure that the republic is a source of advantage to him, and gladly\r\nreceives his pay. Let him therefore bear with patience that he is a\r\nlittle longer absent from home and his family affairs, to which no heavy\r\nexpense is now attached. Whether if the commonwealth should call him to\r\na settlement of accounts, would it not justly say, You have pay by the\r\nyear, perform labour by the year? do you think it just to receive a\r\nwhole year's pay for six months' service? Romans, with reluctance do I\r\ndwell on this topic; for so ought those persons proceed who employ\r\nmercenary troops. But we wish to treat as with fellow-citizens, and we\r\nthink it only just that you treat with us as with the country. Either\r\nthe war should not have been undertaken, or it ought to be conducted\r\nsuitably to the dignity of the Roman people, and brought to a close as\r\nsoon as possible. But it will be brought to a conclusion if we press on\r\nthe besieged; if we do not retire until we have consummated our hopes by\r\nthe capture of Veii. In truth, if there were no other motive, the very\r\ndiscredit of the thing should impose on us perseverance. In former times\r\na city was kept besieged for ten years, on account of one woman, by all\r\nGreece. At what a distance from their homes! how many lands, how many\r\nseas distant! We grumble at enduring a siege of a year's duration within\r\ntwenty miles of us, almost within sight of our own city; because, I\r\nsuppose, the cause of the war is trifling, nor is there resentment\r\nsufficiently just to stimulate us to persevere. Seven times they have\r\nrebelled: in peace they never acted faithfully. They have laid waste our\r\nlands a thousand times: the Fidenatians they forced to revolt from us:\r\nthey have put to death our colonists there: contrary to the law of\r\nnations, they have been the instigators of the impious murder of our\r\nambassadors: they wished to excite all Etruria against us, and are at\r\nthis day busily employed at it; and they scarcely refrained from\r\nviolating our ambassadors when demanding restitution. With such people\r\nought war to be conducted in a remiss and dilatory manner?\r\n\r\n5. \"If such just resentment have no influence with us, will not, I\r\nentreat you, the following considerations influence you? Their city has\r\nbeen enclosed with immense works, by which the enemy is confined within\r\ntheir walls. They have not tilled their land, and what was previously\r\ntilled has been laid waste in the war. If we withdraw our army, who is\r\nthere who can doubt that they will invade our territory not only from a\r\ndesire of revenge, but from the necessity also imposed on them of\r\nplundering from the property of others, since they have lost their own?\r\nBy such measures then we do not put off the war, but admit it within our\r\nown frontiers. What shall I say of that which properly interests the\r\nsoldiers, for whose interests those worthy tribunes of the commons, all\r\non a sudden, are now so anxious to provide, after they have endeavoured\r\nto wrest their pay from them? How does it stand? They have formed a\r\nrampart and a trench, both works of great labour, through so great an\r\nextent of ground; they have erected forts, at first only a few,\r\nafterwards very many, when the army became increased; they have raised\r\ndefenders not only towards the city, but towards Etruria also, against\r\nany succours which may come from thence. What need I mention towers,\r\nvineæ, and testudines, and the other apparatus used in attacking towns?\r\nWhen so much labour has been expended, and they have now at length\r\nreached the end of the work, do you think that all these preparations\r\nshould be abandoned that, next summer, the same course of toil may have\r\nto be undergone again in forming them anew? How much less trouble to\r\nsupport the works already done, and to press on and persevere, and to\r\nget rid of our task! For certainly the matter is of short duration, if\r\nit be conducted with a uniform course of exertions; nor do we by these\r\nintermissions and interruptions expedite the attainment of our hopes. I\r\nam now speaking of labour and of loss of time. What? do these such\r\nfrequent meetings in Etruria on the subject of sending aid to Veii\r\nsuffer us to disregard the danger which we encounter by procrastinating\r\nthe war? As matters stand now, they are incensed, they dislike them,\r\nthey refuse to send any; as far as they are concerned, we are at liberty\r\nto take Veii. Who can promise that their temper will be the same\r\nhereafter, if the war is suspended? when, if you suffer any relaxation,\r\nmore respectable and more frequent embassies will go; when that which\r\nnow displeases the Etrurians, the establishment of a king at Veii, may,\r\nafter an interval, be done away with, either by the joint determination\r\nof the state that they may recover the good will of the Etrurians, or by\r\na voluntary act of the king, who may be unwilling that his reign should\r\nstand in the way of the welfare of his countrymen. See how many\r\ncircumstances, and how detrimental, follow that line of conduct: the\r\nloss of works formed with so great labour; the threatening devastation\r\nof our frontiers; an Etruscan excited instead of a Veientian war. These,\r\ntribunes, are your measures, pretty much the same, in truth, as if a\r\nperson should render a disease tedious, and perhaps incurable, for the\r\nsake of present meat or drink, in a patient who, by resolutely suffering\r\nhimself to be treated, might soon recover his health.\r\n\r\n6. \"If, by Jove, it were of no consequence with respect to the present\r\nwar, yet it certainly would be of the utmost importance to military\r\ndiscipline, that our soldiers should be accustomed not only to enjoy the\r\nvictory obtained by them; but even though matters should proceed more\r\nslowly than was anticipated, to brook the tediousness and await the\r\nissue of their hopes, however tardy; and if the war be not finished in\r\nthe summer, to wait for the winter, and not, like summer birds, in the\r\nvery commencement of autumn look out for shelter and a retreat. I pray\r\nyou, the eagerness and pleasure of hunting hurries men into snow and\r\nfrost, over mountains and woods; shall we not employ that patience on\r\nthe exigencies of war, which even sport and pleasure are wont to call\r\nforth? Are we to suppose that the bodies of our soldiers are so\r\neffeminate, their minds so feeble, that they cannot hold out for one\r\nwinter in a camp, and be absent from home? that, like persons who wage a\r\nnaval war, by taking advantage of the weather, and observing the season\r\nof the year, they are able to endure neither heat nor cold? They would\r\ncertainly blush, should any one lay these things to their charge; and\r\nwould maintain that both their minds and their bodies were possessed of\r\nmanly endurance, and that they were able to conduct war equally well in\r\nwinter and in summer; and that they had not consigned to the tribunes\r\nthe patronage of indolence and sloth, and that they remembered that\r\ntheir ancestors had created this very power, neither in the shade nor\r\nbeneath their roofs. Such sentiments are worthy of the valour of your\r\nsoldiers, such sentiments are worthy of the Roman name, not to consider\r\nmerely Veii, nor this war which is now pressing us, but to seek a\r\nreputation for hereafter for other wars and for other states. Do you\r\nconsider the difference of opinion likely to result from this matter as\r\ntrivial? Whether, pray, are the neighbouring states to suppose that the\r\nRoman people is such, that if any one shall sustain their first assault,\r\nand that of very short continuance, they have nothing afterwards to\r\nfear? or whether such should be the terror of our name, that neither the\r\ntediousness of a distant siege, nor the inclemency of winter, can\r\ndislodge the Roman army from a city once invested, and that they know no\r\nother termination of war than victory, and that they carry on wars not\r\nmore by briskness than by perseverance; which is necessary no doubt in\r\nevery kind of war, but more especially in besieging cities; most of\r\nwhich, impregnable both by their works and by natural situation, time\r\nitself overpowers and reduces by famine and thirst; as it will reduce\r\nVeii, unless the tribunes of the commons shall afford aid to the enemy,\r\nand the Veientians find in Rome reinforcements which they seek in vain\r\nin Etruria. Is there any thing which can happen so much in accordance\r\nwith the wishes of the Veientians, as that first the Roman city, then\r\nthe camp, as it were by contagion, should be filled with sedition? But,\r\nby Jove, among the enemy so forbearing a state of mind prevails, that\r\nnot a single change has taken place among them, either through disgust\r\nat the length of the siege nor even of the kingly form of government;\r\nnor has the refusal of aid by the Etrurians aroused their tempers. For\r\nwhoever will be the abettor of sedition, will be instantly put to death;\r\nnor will it be permitted to any one to utter those sentiments which\r\namongst you are expressed with impunity. He is sure to receive the\r\nbastinade, who forsakes his colours or quits his post. Persons advising\r\nnot one or two soldiers, but whole armies to relinquish their colours or\r\nto forsake their camp, are openly listened to in your public assemblies.\r\nAccordingly whatever a tribune of the people says, although it tends to\r\nthe ruin of the country or the dissolution of the commonwealth, you are\r\naccustomed to listen to with partiality; and captivated with the charms\r\nof that authority, you suffer all sorts of crimes to lie concealed\r\nbeneath it. The only thing that remains is, that what they vociferate\r\nhere, the same projects do they realize in the camp and among the\r\nsoldiers, and seduce the armies, and not suffer them to obey their\r\nofficers; since that and that only is liberty in Rome, to show no\r\ndeference to the senate, nor to magistrates, nor laws, nor the usages of\r\nancestors, nor the institutions of our fathers, nor military\r\ndiscipline.\"\r\n\r\n7. Even already Appius was a match for the tribunes of the people in the\r\npopular assemblies; when suddenly a misfortune sustained before Veii,\r\nfrom a quarter whence no one could expect it, both gave Appius the\r\nsuperiority in the dispute, produced also a greater harmony between the\r\ndifferent orders, and greater ardour to carry on the siege of Veii with\r\nmore pertinacity. For when the trenches were now advanced to the very\r\ncity, and the machines were almost about to be applied to the walls,\r\nwhilst the works are carried on with greater assiduity by day, than they\r\nare guarded by night, a gate was thrown open on a sudden, and a vast\r\nmultitude, armed chiefly with torches, cast fire about on all sides; and\r\nafter the lapse of an hour the flames destroyed both the rampart and the\r\nmachines, the work of so long a time, and great numbers of men, bearing\r\nassistance in vain, were destroyed by the sword and by fire. When the\r\naccount of this circumstance was brought to Rome, it inspired sadness\r\ninto all ranks; into the senate anxiety and apprehension, lest the\r\nsedition could no longer be withstood either in the city or in the camp,\r\nand lest the tribunes of the commons should insult over the\r\ncommonwealth, as if vanquished by them; when on a sudden, those who\r\npossessed an equestrian fortune, but to whom horses had not been\r\nassigned by the public, having previously held a meeting together, went\r\nto the senate; and having obtained permission to speak, promise that\r\nthey will serve on their own horses. And when thanks were returned to\r\nthem by the senate in the most complimentary terms, and the report of\r\nthis proceeding spread through the forum and the city, there suddenly\r\nensues a concourse of the commons to the senate-house. They say that\r\n\"they are now of the pedestrian order, and they preferred their services\r\nto the commonwealth, though not compelled to serve, whether they wished\r\nto march them to Veii, or to any other place. If they were led to Veii,\r\nthey affirm, that they would not return from thence, until the city of\r\nthe enemy was taken.\" Then indeed they with difficulty set bounds to the\r\njoy which now poured in upon them; for they were not ordered, as in the\r\ncase of the horsemen, to be publicly eulogized, the order for so doing\r\nbeing consigned to the magistrates, nor were they summoned into the\r\nsenate-house to receive an answer; nor did the senate confine themselves\r\nwithin the threshold of their house, but every one of them individually\r\nwith their voice and hands testified from the elevated ground the public\r\njoy to the multitude standing in the assembly; they declared that by\r\nthat unanimity the Roman city would be happy, and invincible and\r\neternal; praised the horsemen, praised the commons; extolled the day\r\nitself by their praises; they acknowledged that the courtesy and\r\nkindness of the senate was outdone. Tears flowed in abundance through\r\njoy both from the patricians and commons; until the senators being\r\ncalled back into the house, a decree of the senate was passed, \"that the\r\nmilitary tribunes, summoning an assembly, should return thanks to the\r\ninfantry and cavalry; and should state that the senate would be mindful\r\nof their affectionate attachment to their country. But that it was their\r\nwish that their pay should go on for those who had, out of their turn,\r\nundertaken voluntary service.\" To the horsemen also a certain stipend\r\nwas assigned. Then for the first time the cavalry began to serve on\r\ntheir own horses. This army of volunteers being led to Veii, not only\r\nrestored the works which had been lost, but also erected new ones.\r\nSupplies were conveyed from the city with greater care than before; lest\r\nany thing should be wanting for the accommodation of an army who\r\ndeserved so well.\r\n\r\n8. The following year had military tribunes with consular authority,\r\nCaius Servilius Ahala a third time, Quintus Servilius, Lucius Virginius,\r\nQuintus Sulpicius, Aulus Manlius a second time, Manius Sergius a second\r\ntime. During their tribuneship, whilst the solicitude of all was\r\ndirected to the Veientian war, the garrison at Anxur was neglected in\r\nconsequence of the absence of the soldiers on leave, and from the\r\nindiscriminate admission of Volscian traders was overpowered, the guards\r\nat the gates being suddenly betrayed. Less of the soldiers perished,\r\nbecause they were all trafficking through the country and city like\r\nsuttlers. Nor were matters conducted more successfully at Veii, which\r\nwas then the chief object of all public solicitude. For both the Roman\r\ncommanders had more quarrels among themselves, than spirit against the\r\nenemy; and the severity of the war was exaggerated by the sudden arrival\r\nof the Capenatians and the Faliscians. These two states of Etruria,\r\nbecause they were contiguous in situation, judging that in case Veii was\r\nconquered, they should be next to the attacks of the Romans in war; the\r\nFaliscians also, incensed from a cause affecting themselves, because\r\nthey had already on a former occasion mixed themselves up in a\r\nFidenatian war, being bound together by an oath by reciprocal embassies,\r\nmarched unexpectedly with their armies to Veii. It so happened, they\r\nattacked the camp in that quarter where Manius Sergius, military\r\ntribune, commanded, and occasioned great alarm; because the Romans\r\nimagined that all Etruria was aroused and were advancing in a great\r\nmass. The same opinion aroused the Veientians in the city. Thus the\r\nRoman camp was attacked on both sides; and crowding together, whilst\r\nthey wheeled round their battalions from one post to another, they were\r\nunable either to confine the Veientians within their fortifications, or\r\nrepel the assault from their own works, and to defend themselves from\r\nthe enemy on the outside. The only hope was, if succour could be brought\r\nfrom the greater camp, that the different legions should fight, some\r\nagainst the Capenatians and Faliscians, others against the sallies of\r\nthe townsmen. But Virginius had the command of that camp, who, from\r\npersonal grounds, was hateful to and incensed against Sergius. This\r\nman, when word was brought that most of the forts were attacked, the\r\nfortifications scaled, and that the enemy were pouring in on both sides,\r\nkept his men under arms, saying that if there was need of assistance,\r\nhis colleague would send to him. His arrogance was equalled by the\r\nobstinacy of the other; who, that he might not appear to have sought any\r\naid from an adversary, preferred being defeated by an enemy to\r\nconquering through a fellow-citizen. His men were for a long time cut\r\ndown between both: at length, abandoning their works, a very small\r\nnumber made their way to the principal camp; the greater number, with\r\nSergius himself, made their way to Rome. Where, when he threw the entire\r\nblame on his colleague, it was resolved that Virginius should be sent\r\nfor from the camp, and that lieutenant-generals should take the command\r\nin the mean time. The affair was then discussed in the senate, and the\r\ndispute was carried on between the colleagues with (mutual)\r\nrecriminations. But few took up the interests of the republic, (the\r\ngreater number) favoured the one or the other, according as private\r\nregard or interest prejudiced each.\r\n\r\n9. The principal senators were of opinion, that whether so ignominious a\r\ndefeat had been sustained through the misconduct or the misfortune of\r\nthe commanders, \"the regular time of the elections should not be waited\r\nfor, but that new military tribunes should be created immediately, who\r\nshould enter into office on the calends of October.\" Whilst they were\r\nproceeding to intimate their assent to this opinion, the other military\r\ntribunes offered no opposition. But Sergius and Virginius, on whose\r\naccount it was evident that the senate were dissatisfied with the\r\nmagistrates of that year, at first deprecated the ignominy, then\r\nprotested against the decree of the senate; they declared that they\r\nwould not retire from office before the ides of December, the usual day\r\nfor persons entering on magisterial duties. Upon this the tribunes of\r\nthe plebeians, whilst in the general harmony and in the prosperous state\r\nof public affairs they had unwillingly kept silence, suddenly becoming\r\nconfident, began to threaten the military tribunes, that unless they\r\nconformed to the order of the senate, they would order them to be thrown\r\ninto prison. Then Caius Servilius Ahala, a military tribune, observed,\r\n\"With respect to you, tribunes of the commons, and your threats, I\r\nwould with pleasure put it to the test, how there is not more of\r\nauthority in the latter than of spirit in yourselves. But it is impious\r\nto strive against the authority of the senate. Wherefore do you cease to\r\nseek amid our quarrels for an opportunity of doing mischief; and my\r\ncolleagues will either do that which the senate thinks fit, or if they\r\nshall persist with too much pertinacity, I will immediately nominate a\r\ndictator, who will oblige them to retire from office.\" When this speech\r\nwas approved with general consent, and the patricians rejoiced, that\r\nwithout the terrors of the tribunitian office, another and a superior\r\npower had been discovered to coerce the magistrates, overcome by the\r\nuniversal consent, they held the elections of military tribunes, who\r\nwere to commence their office on the calends of October, and before that\r\nday they retired from office.\r\n\r\n10. During the military tribuneship of Lucius Valerius Potitus for the\r\nfourth time, Marcus Furius Camillus for the second time, Manius Æmilius\r\nMamercinus a third time, Cneius Cornelius Cossus a second time, Kæso\r\nFabius Ambustus, Lucius Julius Iulus, much business was transacted at\r\nhome and abroad. For there was both a complex war at the same time, at\r\nVeii, at Capena, at Falerii, and among the Volscians, that Anxur might\r\nbe recovered from the enemy; and at the same time there was some\r\ndifficulty experienced both in consequence of the levy, and of the\r\ncontribution of the tax: there was also a contention about the\r\nappointment of plebeian tribunes; and the two trials of those, who a\r\nlittle before had been invested with consular authority, excited no\r\ntrifling commotion. First of all the tribunes of the soldiers took care\r\nthat the levy should be held; and not only the juniors were enlisted,\r\nbut the seniors also were compelled to give in their names, to serve as\r\na garrison to the city. But in proportion as the number of the soldiers\r\nwas augmented, so much the greater sum of money was required for pay;\r\nand this was collected by a tax, those who remained at home contributing\r\nagainst their will, because those who guarded the city had to perform\r\nmilitary service also, and to serve the commonwealth. The tribunes of\r\nthe commons, by their seditious harangues, caused these things, grievous\r\nin themselves, to seem more exasperating, by their asserting, \"that pay\r\nwas established for the soldiers with this view, that they might wear\r\nout one half of the commons by military service, the other half by the\r\ntax. That a single war was being waged now for the third year, on\r\npurpose that they may have a longer time to wage it. That armies had\r\nbeen raised at one levy for four different wars, and that boys even and\r\nold men were dragged from home. That neither summer nor winter now made\r\nany difference, so that there may never be any respite for the\r\nunfortunate commons, who were now even at last made to pay a tax; so\r\nthat after they brought home their bodies wasted by hardship, wounds,\r\nand eventually by age, and found their properties at home neglected by\r\nthe absence of the proprietors, had to pay a tax out of their impaired\r\nfortunes, and to refund to the state in a manifold proportion the\r\nmilitary pay which had been as it were received on interest.\" Between\r\nthe levy and the tax, and their minds being taken up by more important\r\nconcerns, the number of plebeian tribunes could not be filled up at the\r\nelections. A struggle was afterwards made that patricians should be\r\nelected into the vacant places. When this could not be carried, still,\r\nfor the purpose of weakening the Trebonian law, it was managed that\r\nCaius Lacerius and Marcus Acutius should be admitted as tribunes of the\r\ncommons, no doubt through the influence of the patricians.\r\n\r\n11. Chance so directed it, that this year Cneius Trebonius was tribune\r\nof the commons, and he considered that he undertook the patronage of the\r\nTrebonian law as a debt due to his name and family. He crying out aloud,\r\n\"that a point which some patricians had aimed at, though baffled in\r\ntheir first attempt, had yet been carried by the military tribunes; that\r\nthe Trebonian law had been subverted, and tribunes of the commons had\r\nbeen elected not by the suffrages of the people but by the mandate of\r\nthe patricians; and that the thing was now come to this, that either\r\npatricians or dependants of patricians were to be had for tribunes of\r\nthe commons; that the devoting laws were taken away, the tribunitian\r\npower wrested from them; he alleged that this was effected by some\r\nartifice of the patricians, by the villany and treachery of his\r\ncolleagues.\" While not only the patricians, but the tribunes of the\r\ncommons also became objects of public resentment; as well those who were\r\nelected, as those who had elected them; then three of the college,\r\nPublius Curiatius, Marcus Metilius, and Marcus Minucius, alarmed for\r\ntheir interests, make an attack on Sergius and Virginius, military\r\ntribunes of the former year; they turn away the resentment of the\r\ncommons, and public odium from themselves on them, by appointing a day\r\nof trial for them. They observe that \"those persons by whom the levy,\r\nthe tribute, the long service, and the distant seat of the war was felt\r\nas a grievance, those who lamented the calamity sustained at Veii; such\r\nas had their houses in mourning through the loss of children, brothers,\r\nrelatives, and kinsmen, had now through their means the right and power\r\nof avenging the public and private sorrow on the two guilty causes. For\r\nthat the sources of all their sufferings were centred in Sergius and\r\nVirginius: nor did the prosecutor advance that charge more\r\nsatisfactorily than the accused acknowledged it; who, both guilty, threw\r\nthe blame from one to the other, Virginius charging Sergius with running\r\naway, Sergius charging Virginius with treachery. The folly of whose\r\nconduct was so incredible, that it is much more probable that the affair\r\nhad been contrived by concert, and by the common artifice of the\r\npatricians. That by them also an opportunity was formerly given to the\r\nVeientians to burn the works for the sake of protracting the war; and\r\nthat now the army was betrayed, and the Roman camp delivered up to the\r\nFaliscians. That every thing was done that the young men should grow old\r\nbefore Veii, and that the tribunes should not be able to consult the\r\npeople either regarding the lands or the other interests of the commons,\r\nand to give weight to their measures by a numerous attendance [of\r\ncitizens], and to make head against the conspiracy of the patricians.\r\nThat a previous judgment had been already passed on the accused both by\r\nthe senate and the Roman people and by their own colleagues. For that by\r\na decree of the senate they had been removed from the administration of\r\naffairs, and when they refused to resign their office they had been\r\nforced into it by their colleagues; and that the Roman people had\r\nelected tribunes, who were to enter on their office not on the ides of\r\nDecember, the usual day, but instantly on the calends of October,\r\nbecause the republic could no longer subsist, these persons remaining in\r\noffice. And yet these individuals, overwhelmed and already condemned by\r\nso many decisions against them, presented themselves for trial before\r\nthe people; and thought that they were done with the matter, and had\r\nsuffered sufficient punishment, because they were reduced to the state\r\nof private citizens two months sooner [than ordinary]: and did not\r\nconsider that the power of doing mischief any longer was then taken from\r\nthem, that punishment was not inflicted; for that the official power of\r\ntheir colleagues also had been taken from them who certainly had\r\ncommitted no fault. That the Roman citizens should resume those\r\nsentiments which they had when the recent disaster was sustained, when\r\nthey beheld the army flying in consternation, covered with wounds, and\r\nin dismay pouring into the gates, accusing not fortune nor any of the\r\ngods, but these their commanders. They were certain, that there was not\r\na man present in the assembly who did not execrate and detest the\r\npersons, families, and fortunes of Lucius Virginius and Manius Sergius.\r\nThat it was by no means consistent that now, when it was lawful and\r\ntheir duty, they should not exert their power against persons, on whom\r\nthey had severally imprecated the vengeance of the gods. That the gods\r\nthemselves never laid hands on the guilty; it was enough if they armed\r\nthe injured with the means of taking revenge.\"\r\n\r\n12. Urged on by these discourses the commons condemn the accused [in a\r\nfine] of ten thousand _asses_ in weight, Sergius in vain throwing the\r\nblame on fortune and the common chance of war, Virginius entreating that\r\nhe might not be more unfortunate at home than he had been in the field.\r\nThe resentment of the people being turned against them, obliterated the\r\nremembrance of the assumption of the tribunes and of the fraud committed\r\nagainst the Trebonian law. The victorious tribunes, in order that the\r\npeople might reap an immediate benefit from the trial, publish a form of\r\nan agrarian law, and prevent the tax from being contributed, since there\r\nwas need of pay for so great a number of troops, and the enterprises of\r\nthe service were conducted with success in such a manner, that in none\r\nof the wars did they reach the consummation of their hope. At Veii the\r\ncamp which had been lost was recovered and strengthened with forts and a\r\ngarrison. Here M. Æmilius and Kæso Fabius, military tribunes, commanded.\r\nNone of the enemy were found outside the walls by Marcus Furius in the\r\nFalisean territory, and Cneius Cornelius in the Capenatian district:\r\nspoil was driven off, and the country laid waste by burning of the\r\nhouses and the fruits of the earth: the towns were neither assaulted\r\nnor besieged. But among the Volscians, their territory being\r\ndepopulated, Anxur, which was situate on an eminence, was assaulted, but\r\nto no purpose; and when force was ineffectual, they commenced to\r\nsurround it with a rampart and a trench. The province of the Volscians\r\nhad fallen [to the lot of] Valerius Potitus. In this state of military\r\naffairs an intestine disturbance broke out with greater violence than\r\nthe wars were proceeded with. And when it was rendered impossible by the\r\ntribunes to have the tax paid, and the payment [of the army] was not\r\nremitted to the generals, and the soldiers became importunate for their\r\npay, the camp also was well nigh being involved in the contagion of the\r\nsedition in the city. Amid this resentment of the commons against the\r\npatricians, though the tribunes asserted that now was the time for\r\nestablishing liberty, and transferring the sovereign dignity from the\r\nSergii and Virginii to plebeians, men of fortitude and energy, still\r\nthey proceeded no further than the election of one of the commons,\r\nPublius Licinius Calvus, military tribune with consular power for the\r\npurpose of establishing their right by precedent: the others elected\r\nwere patricians, Publius Mænius, Lucius Titinius, Publius Mælius, Lucius\r\nFurius Medullinus, Lucius Publius Volscus. The commons themselves were\r\nsurprised at having gained so important a point, and not merely he who\r\nhad been elected, being a person who had filled no post of honour\r\nbefore, being only a senator of long standing, and now weighed down with\r\nyears. Nor does it sufficiently appear, why he was elected first and in\r\npreference to any one else to taste the sweets of the new dignity. Some\r\nthink that he was raised to so high a dignity through the influence of\r\nhis brother, Cneius Cornelius, who had been military tribune on the\r\npreceding year, and had given triple pay to the cavalry. Others [say]\r\nthat he had himself delivered a seasonable address equally acceptable to\r\nthe patricians and commons, concerning the harmony of the several orders\r\n[of the state]. The tribunes of the commons, exulting in this victory at\r\nthe election, relaxed in their opposition regarding the tax, a matter\r\nwhich very much impeded the progress of public business. It was paid in\r\nwith submission, and sent to the army.\r\n\r\n13. In the country of the Volscians Anxur was soon retaken, the guarding\r\nof the city having been neglected during a festival day. This year was\r\nremarkable for a cold and snowy winter, so that the roads were\r\nimpassable, and the Tiber not navigable. The price of provisions\r\nunderwent no change, in consequence of the abundance previously laid in.\r\nAnd because Publius Licinius, as he obtained his office without any\r\nrioting, to the greater joy of the commons than annoyance of the\r\npatricians, so also did he administer it; a rapturous desire of electing\r\nplebeians at the next election took possession of them. Of the\r\npatricians Marcus Veturius alone obtained a place: almost all the\r\ncenturies appointed the other plebeian candidates as military tribunes\r\nwith consular authority. Marcus Pomponius, Caius Duilius, Volero\r\nPublilius, Cneius Genucius, Lucius Atilius. The severe winter, whether\r\nfrom the ill temperature of the air [arising] from the abrupt transition\r\nto the contrary state, or from whatsoever other cause, was followed by\r\nan unhealthy summer, destructive to all species of animals; and when\r\nneither the cause nor termination of this intractable pestilence could\r\nbe discovered, the Sibylline books were consulted according to a decree\r\nof the senate. The duumvirs for the direction of religious matters, the\r\nlectisternium being then for the first time introduced into the city of\r\nRome, for eight days implored the favour of Apollo and Latona, Diana and\r\nHercules, Mercury and Neptune, three couches being laid out with the\r\ngreatest magnificence that was then possible. The same solemn rite was\r\nobserved also by private individuals. The doors lying open throughout\r\nthe entire city, and the use of every thing lying out in common, they\r\nsay that all passengers, both those known and those unknown\r\nindiscriminately, were invited to lodgings, and that conversation was\r\nadopted between persons at variance with complaisance and kindness, and\r\nthat they refrained from disputes and quarrels; their chains were also\r\ntaken off those who were in confinement during those days; that\r\nafterward a scruple was felt in imprisoning those to whom the gods had\r\nbrought such aid. In the mean while the alarm was multiplied at Veii,\r\nthree wars being concentred in the one place. For as the Capenatians and\r\nFaliscians had suddenly come with succour [to the Veientians], they had\r\nto fight against three armies on different sides in the same manner as\r\nformerly, through the whole extent of their works. The recollection of\r\nthe sentence passed on Sergius and Virginius aided them above every\r\nthing else. Accordingly some forces being led around in a short time\r\nfrom the principal camp, where some delay had been made on the former\r\noccasion, attack the Capenatians on their rear, whilst they were engaged\r\nin front against the Roman rampart. The fight commencing in this quarter\r\nstruck terror into the Faliscians also, and a sally from the camp\r\nopportunely made put them to flight, thrown into disorder as they now\r\nwere. The victors, having then pursued them in their retreat, made great\r\nslaughter amongst them. And soon after those who had been devastating\r\nthe territory of Capena, having met them as it were by chance, entirely\r\ncut off the survivors of the fight as they were straggling through the\r\ncountry: and many of the Veientians in their retreat to the city were\r\nslain before the gates; whilst, through fear lest the Romans should\r\nforce in along with them, they excluded the hindmost of their men by\r\nclosing the gates.\r\n\r\n14. These were the transactions of that year. And now the election of\r\nmilitary tribunes approached; about which the patricians felt more\r\nintense solicitude than about the war, inasmuch as they saw that the\r\nsupreme authority was not only shared with the commons, but almost lost\r\nto themselves. Wherefore the most distinguished individuals being, by\r\nconcert, prepared to stand candidates, whom they thought [the people]\r\nwould feel ashamed to pass by, they themselves, nevertheless, as if they\r\nwere all candidates, trying every expedient, strove to gain over not\r\nonly men, but the gods also, raising religious scruples about the\r\nelections held the two preceding years; that, in the former of those\r\nyears, a winter set in intolerably severe, and like to a prodigy from\r\nthe gods; on the next year [they had] not prodigies, but events, a\r\npestilence inflicted on both city and country through the manifest\r\nresentment of the gods: whom, as was discovered in the books of the\r\nfates, it was necessary to appease, for the purpose of warding off that\r\nplague. That it seemed to the gods an affront that honours should be\r\nprostituted, and the distinctions of birth confounded, in an election\r\nwhich was held under proper auspices. The people, overawed as well by\r\nthe dignity of the candidates as by a sense of religion, elected all the\r\nmilitary tribunes with consular power from among the patricians, the\r\ngreater part being men who had been most highly distinguished by honour;\r\nLucius Valerius Potitus a fifth time, Marcus Valerius Maximus, Marcus\r\nFurius Camillus a third time, Lucius Furius Medullinus a third time,\r\nQuintus Servilius Fidenas a second time, Quintus Sulpicius Camerinus a\r\nsecond time. During this tribunate, nothing very memorable was performed\r\nat Veii. All their force was employed in depopulating the country. Two\r\nconsummate commanders, Potitus from Falerii, Camillus from Capena,\r\ncarried off great booty, nothing being left undestroyed which could be\r\ninjured by sword or by fire.\r\n\r\n15. In the mean time many prodigies were announced; the greater part of\r\nwhich were little credited or even slighted, because individuals were\r\nthe reporters of them, and also because, the Etrurians being now at war\r\nwith them, they had no aruspices through whom they might attend to them.\r\nThe attention of all was turned to a particular one: the lake in the\r\nAlban grove swelled to an unusual height without any rain, or any other\r\ncause which could account for the matter independently of a miracle.\r\nCommissioners were sent to the Delphic oracle to inquire what the gods\r\nportended by this prodigy; but an interpreter of the fates was presented\r\nto them nearer home in a certain aged Veientian, who, amid the scoffs\r\nthrown out by the Roman and Etrurian soldiers from the out-posts and\r\nguards, declared, after the manner of one delivering a prophecy, that\r\nuntil the water should be discharged from the Alban lake, the Romans\r\nshould never become masters of Veii. This was disregarded at first as\r\nhaving been thrown out at random, afterwards it began to be canvassed in\r\nconversation; until one of the Roman soldiers on guard asked one of the\r\ntownsmen who was nearest him (a conversational intercourse having now\r\ntaken place in consequence of the long continuance of the war) who he\r\nwas, who threw out those dark expressions concerning the Alban lake?\r\nAfter he heard that he was an aruspex, being a man whose mind was not\r\nwithout a tincture of religion, pretending that he wished to consult him\r\non the expiation of a private portent, if he could aid him, he enticed\r\nthe prophet to a conference. And when, being unarmed, they had proceeded\r\na considerable distance from their respective parties without any\r\napprehension, the Roman youth having the advantage in strength, took up\r\nthe feeble old man in the sight of all, and amid the ineffectual bustle\r\nmade by the Etrurians, carried him away to his own party. When he was\r\nconducted before the general, and sent from thence to Rome to the\r\nsenate, to those who asked him what that was which he had stated\r\nconcerning the Alban lake, he replied, \"that undoubtedly the gods were\r\nangry with the Veientian people on that day, on which they had inspired\r\nhim with the resolve to disclose the ruin of his country as destined by\r\nthe fates. Wherefore what he then declared urged by divine inspiration,\r\nhe neither could recall so that it may be unsaid; and perhaps by\r\nconcealing what the immortal gods wished to be published, no less guilt\r\nwas contracted than by openly declaring what ought to be concealed. Thus\r\ntherefore it was recorded in the books of the fates, thus in the\r\nEtrurian doctrine, that whensoever the Alban water should rise to a\r\ngreat height, then, if the Romans should discharge it in a proper\r\nmanner, victory was granted them over the Veientians: before that\r\noccurred, that the gods would not desert the walls of Veii.\" He then\r\ndetailed what would be the legitimate method of draining. But the senate\r\ndeeming his authority as but of little weight, and not to be entirely\r\ndepended on in so important a matter, determined to wait for the\r\ndeputies and the responses of the Pythian oracle.\r\n\r\n16. Before the commissioners returned from Delphos, or an expiation of\r\nthe Alban prodigy was discovered, the new military tribunes with\r\nconsular power entered on their office, Lucius Julius Iulus, Lucius\r\nFurius Medullinus for the fourth time, Lucius Sergius Fidenas, Aulus\r\nPostumius Regillensis, Publius Cornelius Maluginensis, and Aulus\r\nManlius. This year a new enemy, the Tarquinians, started up. Because\r\nthey saw the Romans engaged in many wars together, that of the Volscians\r\nat Anxur, where the garrison was besieged, that of the Æquans at Lavici,\r\nwho were attacking the Roman colony there, moreover in the Veientian,\r\nFaliscan, and Capenatian war, and that matters were not more tranquil\r\nwithin the walls, by reason of the dissensions between the patricians\r\nand commons; considering that amid these [troubles] there was an\r\nopportunity for an attack, they send their light-armed cohorts to commit\r\ndepredations on the Roman territory. For [they concluded] either that\r\nthe Romans would suffer that injury to pass off unavenged, that they\r\nmight not encumber themselves with an additional war, or that they would\r\nresent it with a scanty army, and one by no means strong. The Romans\r\n[felt] greater indignation, than alarm, at the inroads of the\r\nTarquinians. On this account the matter was neither taken up with great\r\npreparation, nor was it delayed for any length of time. Aulus Postumius\r\nand Lucius Julius, having raised a body of men, not by a regular levy,\r\n(for they were prevented by the tribunes of the commons,) but [a body\r\nconsisting] mostly of volunteers, whom they had aroused by exhortations,\r\nhaving proceeded by cross marches through the territory of Cære, fell\r\nunexpectedly on the Tarquinians, as they were returning from their\r\ndepredations and laden with booty; they slew great numbers, stripped\r\nthem all of their baggage, and, having recovered the spoils of their own\r\nlands, they return to Rome. Two days were allowed to the owners to\r\nreclaim their effects. On the third day, that portion not owned (for\r\nmost of it belonged to the enemies themselves) was sold by public\r\nauction; and what was produced from thence, was distributed among the\r\nsoldiers. The other wars, and more especially the Veientian, were of\r\ndoubtful issue. And now the Romans, despairing of human aid, began to\r\nlook to the fates and the gods, when the deputies returned from Delphos,\r\nbringing with them an answer of the oracle, corresponding with the\r\nresponse of the captive prophet: \"Roman, beware lest the Alban water be\r\nconfined in the lake, beware of suffering it to flow into the sea in its\r\nown stream. Thou shalt let it out and form a passage for it through the\r\nfields, and by dispersing it in channels thou shalt consume it. Then\r\npress boldly on the walls of the enemy, mindful that the victory is\r\ngranted to you by these fates which are now revealed over that city\r\nwhich thou art besieging for so many years. The war being ended, do\r\nthou, as victorious, bring ample offerings to my temples, and having\r\nrenewed the religious institutions of your country, the care of which\r\nhas been given up, perform them in the usual manner.\"\r\n\r\n17. Upon this the captive prophet began to be held in high esteem, and\r\nCornelius and Postumius, the military tribunes, began to employ him for\r\nthe expiation of the Alban prodigy, and to appease the gods in due form.\r\nAnd it was at length discovered wherein the gods found fault with the\r\nneglect of the ceremonies and the omission of the customary rites; that\r\nit was undoubtedly nothing else, than that the magistrates, having been\r\nappointed under some defect [in their election], had not directed the\r\nLatin festival and the solemnities on the Alban mount with due\r\nregularity. The only mode of expiation in the case was, that the\r\nmilitary tribunes should resign their office, the auspices be taken\r\nanew, and an interregnum be adopted. All these things were performed\r\naccording to a decree of the senate. There were three interreges in\r\nsuccession, Lucius Valerius, Quintus Servilius Fidenas, Marcus Furius\r\nCamillus. In the mean time disturbances never ceased to exist, the\r\ntribunes of the commons impeding the elections until it was previously\r\nstipulated, that the greater number of the military tribunes should be\r\nelected out of the commons. Whilst these things are going on, assemblies\r\nof Etruria were held at the temple of Voltumna, and the Capenatians and\r\nFaliscians demanding that all the states of Etruria should by common\r\nconsent and resolve aid in raising the siege of Veii, the answer given\r\nwas: \"that on a former occasion they had refused that to the Veientians,\r\nbecause they had no right to demand aid from those from whom they had\r\nnot solicited advice on so important a matter. That for the present\r\ntheir own condition instead of themselves[160] denied it to them, more\r\nespecially in that part of Etruria. That a strange nation, the Gauls,\r\nwere become new neighbours, with whom they neither had a sufficiently\r\nsecure peace, nor a certainty of war: to the blood, however, and the\r\nname and the present dangers of their kinsmen this [mark of respect] was\r\npaid, that if any of their youth were disposed to go to that war, they\r\nwould not prevent them.\" Hence there was a report at Rome, that a great\r\nnumber of enemies had arrived, and in consequence the intestine\r\ndissensions began to subside, as is usual, through alarm for the general\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 160: So I have rendered _pro se_--or it may be rendered,\r\n\"considering their circumstances,\" scil. the external circumstances in\r\nwhich they were placed.]\r\n\r\n18. Without opposition on the part of the patricians, the prerogative\r\ntribe elect Publius Licinius Calvus military tribune without his suing\r\nfor it, a man of tried moderation in his former tribunate, but now of\r\nextreme old age; and it was observed that all were re-elected in regular\r\nsuccession out of the college of the same year, Lucius Titinius, Publius\r\nMænius, Publius Mælius, Cneius Genucius, Lucius Atilius: before these\r\nwere proclaimed, the tribes being summoned in the ordinary course,\r\nPublius Licinius Calvus, by permission of the interrex, spoke as\r\nfollows: \"Romans, I perceive that from the recollection of our\r\nadministration you are seeking an omen of concord, a thing most\r\nimportant at the present time, for the ensuing year. If you re-elect the\r\nsame colleagues, improved also by experience, in me you no longer behold\r\nthe same person, but the shadow and name of Publius Licinius now left.\r\nThe powers of my body are decayed, my senses of sight and hearing are\r\ngrown dull, my memory falters, the vigour of my mind is blunted. Behold\r\nhere a youth,\" says he, holding his son, \"the representation and image\r\nof him whom ye formerly made a military tribune, the first from among\r\nthe commons. This youth, formed under my own discipline, I present and\r\ndedicate to the commonwealth as a substitute for myself. And I beseech\r\nyou, Romans, that the honour readily offered by yourselves to me, you\r\nwould grant to his suit, and to my prayers added in his behalf.\" The\r\nfavour was granted to the request of the father, and his son, Publius\r\nLicinius, was declared military tribune with consular power along with\r\nthose whom I have mentioned above. Titinius and Genucius, military\r\ntribunes, proceeded against the Faliscians and Capenatians, and whilst\r\nthey conduct the war with more courage than conduct, they fall into an\r\nambush. Genucius, atoning for his temerity by an honourable death, fell\r\namong the foremost in front of the standards. Titinius, having collected\r\nhis men from the great confusion [into which they were thrown] on a\r\nrising ground, restored their order of battle; nor did he, however,\r\nventure to engage the enemy on even ground. More of disgrace than of\r\nloss was sustained; which was well nigh proving a great calamity; so\r\nmuch alarm was excited not only at Rome, whither an exaggerated account\r\nof it had reached, but in the camp also at Veii. There the soldiers were\r\nwith difficulty restrained from flight, as a report had spread through\r\nthe camp that, the generals and army having been cut to pieces, the\r\nvictorious Capenatians and Faliscians and all the youth of Etruria were\r\nnot far off. At Rome they gave credit to accounts still more alarming\r\nthan these, that the camp at Veii was now attacked, that a part of the\r\nenemy was now advancing to the city prepared for an attack: they crowded\r\nto the walls, and supplications of the matrons, which the public panic\r\nhad called forth from their houses, were offered up in the temples; and\r\nthe gods were petitioned by prayers, that they would repel destruction\r\nfrom the houses and temples of the city and from the walls of Rome, and\r\nthat they would avert that terror to Veii, if the sacred rites had been\r\nduly renewed, if the prodigies had been expiated.\r\n\r\n19. The games and the Latin festival had now been performed anew; now\r\nthe water from the Alban lake had been discharged upon the fields, and\r\nthe fates were demanding [the ruin of] Veii. Accordingly a general\r\ndestined for the destruction of that city and the preservation of his\r\ncountry, Marcus Furius Camillus, being nominated dictator, appointed\r\nPublius Cornelius Scipio his master of the horse. The change of the\r\ngeneral suddenly produced a change in every thing. Their hopes seemed\r\ndifferent, the spirits of the people were different, the fortune also of\r\nthe city seemed changed. First of all, he punished according to military\r\ndiscipline those who had fled from Veii in that panic, and took measures\r\nthat the enemy should not be the most formidable object to the soldier.\r\nThen a levy being proclaimed for a certain day, he himself in the mean\r\nwhile makes an excursion to Veii to strengthen the spirits of the\r\nsoldiers: thence he returns to Rome to enlist the new army, not a single\r\nman declining the service. Youth from foreign states also, Latins and\r\nHernicians, came, promising their service for the war: after the\r\ndictator returned them thanks in the senate, all preparations being now\r\ncompleted for the war, he vowed, according to a decree of the senate,\r\nthat he would, on the capture of Veii, celebrate the great games, and\r\nthat he would repair and dedicate the temple of Mother Matuta, which had\r\nbeen formerly consecrated by King Servius Tullius. Having set out from\r\nthe city with his army amid the high expectation[161] rather than mere\r\nhopes of persons, he first encountered the Faliscians and Capenatians in\r\nthe district of Nepote. Every thing there being managed with consummate\r\nprudence and skill, was attended, as is usual, with success. He not only\r\nrouted the enemy in battle, but he stripped them also of their camp, and\r\nobtained a great quantity of spoil, the principal part of which was\r\nhanded over to the quæstor; not much was given to the soldiers. From\r\nthence the army was marched to Veii, and additional forts close to each\r\nother were erected; and by a proclamation being issued, that no one\r\nshould fight without orders, the soldiers were taken off from those\r\nskirmishes, which frequently took place at random between the wall and\r\nrampart, [so as to apply] to the work. Of all the works, far the\r\ngreatest and more laborious was a mine which they commenced to carry\r\ninto the enemies' citadel. And that the work might not be interrupted,\r\nand that the continued labour under ground might not exhaust the same\r\nindividuals, he divided the number of pioneers into six companies; six\r\nhours were allotted for the work in rotation; nor by night or day did\r\nthey give up, until they made a passage into the citadel.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 161: _Expectatione, &c._ With confident expectations on the\r\npart of his countrymen, rather than simple hope.]\r\n\r\n20. When the dictator now saw that the victory was in his hands, that a\r\nmost opulent city was on the point of being taken, and that there would\r\nbe more spoil than had been obtained in all previous wars taken\r\ntogether, that he might not incur either the resentment of the soldiers\r\nfrom a parsimonious partition of the plunder, or displeasure among the\r\npatricians from a prodigal lavishing of it, he sent a letter to the\r\nsenate, \"that by the kindness of the immortal gods, his own measures,\r\nand the perseverance of the soldiers, Veii would be soon in the power of\r\nthe Roman people.\" What did they think should be done with respect to\r\nthe spoil? Two opinions divided the senate; the one that of the elder\r\nPublius Licinius, who on being first asked by his son, as they say,\r\nproposed it as his opinion, that a proclamation should be openly sent\r\nforth to the people, that whoever wished to share in the plunder, should\r\nproceed to the camp before Veii; the other that of Appius Claudius,[162]\r\nwho, censuring such profusion as unprecedented, extravagant, partial,\r\nand one that was unadvisable, if they should once judge it criminal,\r\nthat money taken from the enemy should be [deposited] in the treasury\r\nwhen exhausted by wars, advised their pay to be paid to the soldiers out\r\nof that money, so that the commons might thereby have to pay less tax.\r\nFor that \"the families of all would feel their share of such a bounty in\r\nequal proportion; that the hands of the idlers in the city, ever greedy\r\nfor plunder, would not then carry off the prizes due to brave warriors,\r\nas it generally so happens that according as each individual is wont to\r\nseek the principal part of the toil and danger, so is he the least\r\nactive as a plunderer.\" Licinius, on the other hand, argued that the\r\nmoney in that case would ever prove the source of jealousy and\r\nanimosity, and that it would afford grounds for charges before the\r\ncommons, and thence for seditions and new laws. \"That it was more\r\nadvisable therefore that the feelings of the commons should be\r\nconciliated by that bounty; that succour should be afforded them,\r\nexhausted and drained by a tax of so many years, and that they should\r\nfeel the fruits arising from a war, in which they had in a manner grown\r\nold. What each took from the enemy with his own hand and brought home\r\nwith him would be more gratifying and delightful, than if he were to\r\nreceive a much larger share at the will of another.\" That the dictator\r\nhimself wished to shun the odium and recriminations arising from the\r\nmatter; for that reason he transferred it to the senate. The senate,\r\ntoo, ought to hand the matter thus referred to them over to the commons,\r\nand suffer every man to have what the fortune of war gave to him. This\r\nproposition appeared to be the safer, as it would make the senate\r\npopular. A proclamation was therefore issued, that those who chose\r\nshould proceed to the camp to the dictator for the plunder of Veii.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 162: According to Niebuhr, (vol. ii. p. 233,) this fear put\r\ninto the mouth of Claudius, is attributable to ignorance or\r\nforgetfulness on the part of Livy, of the early usage in the dividing of\r\nspoils, which had ceased to be observed in the time of Augustus.\r\nAccording to former Roman usage, half of the conquering army was\r\nemployed, under the sanction of a solemn oath, to subtract nothing, in\r\ncollecting the spoil, which was then partly divided by lot, partly sold,\r\nand the proceeds, if promised to the soldiers, disbursed to them man by\r\nman, if otherwise, it was brought into the treasury. Both schemes\r\nmentioned here by Livy, it will be observed, contemplated compensation\r\nto the people for the war-tax which they had so long paid; but that of\r\nLicinius was more favourable, especially to the poor, as the ordinary\r\ncitizens would receive equal shares, and the compensation would be\r\ndirect and immediate.--_Gunne._]\r\n\r\n21. The vast multitude who went filled the camp. Then the dictator,\r\ngoing forth after taking the auspices, having issued orders that the\r\nsoldiers should take arms, says, \"Under thy guidance, O Pythian Apollo,\r\nand inspired by thy divinity, I proceed to destroy the city of Veii, and\r\nI vow to thee the tenth part of the spoil.[163] Thee also, queen Juno,\r\nwho inhabitest Veii, I beseech, that thou wilt accompany us, when\r\nvictors, into our city, soon to be thine, where a temple worthy of thy\r\nmajesty shall receive thee.\"[164] Having offered up these prayers, there\r\nbeing more than a sufficient number of men, he assaults the city on\r\nevery quarter, in order that the perception of the danger threatening\r\nthem from the mine might be diminished. The Veientians, ignorant that\r\nthey had already been doomed by their own prophets, already by foreign\r\noracles, that the gods had been already invited to a share in their\r\nplunder, that some, called out by vows from their city, were looking\r\ntowards the temple of the enemy and new habitations, and that they were\r\nspending that the last day [of their existence], fearing nothing less\r\nthan that, their walls being undermined, the citadel was now filled with\r\nenemies, briskly run to the walls in arms, wondering what could be the\r\nreason that, when no one had stirred from the Roman posts for so many\r\ndays, then, as if struck with sudden fury, they should run heedlessly to\r\nthe walls. A fabulous narrative is introduced here, that, when the king\r\nof the Veientians was offering sacrifice, the voice of the aruspex,\r\ndeclaring that the victory was given to him who should cut up the\r\nentrails of that victim, having been heard in the mine, incited the\r\nRoman soldiers to burst open the mine, carry off the entrails, and bring\r\nthem to the dictator. But in matters of such remote antiquity, I should\r\ndeem it sufficient, if matters bearing a resemblance to truth be\r\nadmitted as true. Such stories as this, more suited to display on the\r\nstage, which delights in the marvellous, than to historic authenticity,\r\nit is not worth while either to affirm or refute. The mine, at this time\r\nfull of chosen men, suddenly discharged the armed troops in the temple\r\nof Juno which was in the citadel of Veii.[165] Some of them attack the\r\nrear of the enemy on the walls; some tore open the bars of the gates;\r\nsome set fire to the houses, while stones and tiles were thrown down\r\nfrom the roofs by the women and slaves. Clamour, consisting of the\r\nvarious voices of the assailants and the terrified, mixed with the\r\ncrying of women and children, fills every place. The soldiers being in\r\nan instant beaten off from the walls, and the gates being thrown open,\r\nsome entering in bodies, others scaling the deserted walls, the city\r\nbecome filled with enemies, fighting takes place in every quarter. Then,\r\nmuch slaughter being now made, the ardour of the fight abates; and the\r\ndictator commands the heralds to proclaim that the unarmed should be\r\nspared. This put an end to bloodshed. Then laying down their arms, they\r\ncommenced to surrender; and, by permission of the dictator, the soldiers\r\ndisperse in quest of plunder. And when this was collected before his\r\neyes, greater in quantity and in the value of the effects than he had\r\nhoped or expected, the dictator, raising his hands to heaven, is said to\r\nhave prayed, \"that, if his success and that of the Roman people seemed\r\nexcessive to any of the gods and men, it might be permitted to the Roman\r\npeople to appease that jealousy with as little detriment as possible to\r\nhimself and the Roman people.\"[166] It is recorded that, when turning\r\nabout during this prayer, he stumbled and fell; and to persons judging\r\nof the matter by subsequent events, that seemed to refer as an omen to\r\nCamillus' own condemnation, and the disaster of the city of Rome being\r\nakin, which happened a few years after. And that day was consumed in\r\nslaughtering the enemy and in the plunder of this most opulent city.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 163: \"This vow frequently occurs in Grecian history, like that\r\nmade of the Persian booty, but this is the only instance in the history\r\nof Rome.\"--_Niebuhr_, vol. ii. 239.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 164: _Evocatos_. When the Romans besieged a town, and thought\r\nthemselves sure of taking it, they used solemnly to call out of it the\r\ngods in whose protection the place was supposed to be.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 165: The idea of the Romans working a mine, even through the\r\nsoil of Veii, so as to be sure of reaching not only the town and the\r\ncitadel, and even the temple, is considered by Niebuhr as extremely\r\nridiculous. He deems the circumstance a clear proof of the fiction that\r\nattaches to the entire story of the capture of Veii. The whole seems to\r\nbe an imitation of the siege of Troy.--_Gunne._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 166: The passage in the original, in the generality of\r\neditions, is read as follows: _ut eam invidium lenire, quàm minimo suo\r\nprivato incommodo publicoque, populo Romano liceret_: i. e. that both\r\nhimself and the Roman people may get over the evil consequences of the\r\njealousy of the gods with as little detriment as possible to either:\r\n_populi Romani_ seems preferable here: i. e. \"that it might be allowed\r\nto lighten that jealousy, by the least possible injury to his own\r\nprivate interest, and to the public interests of the Roman people.\"\r\nThere were certainly two persons concerned in the _invidia_ and\r\n_incommodum_ here, Camillus himself, and the Roman people; to whom\r\nrespectively the _damnatio_, and _elades captæ urbis_, afterwards\r\nmentioned, obviously refer. Some editions read, _invidiam lenire suo\r\nprivato incommodo, quàm minimo publico populi Romani liceret_. This is\r\nthe reading adopted by Crevier; i. e. \"to appease the jealousy by his\r\nown private loss, rather than the least public loss.\" This is more in\r\naccordance with the account given of Camillus by Plutarch, and contains\r\na sentiment certainly more worthy both of Livy and of Camillus.\r\nSentiments ascribed by Plutarch to Camillus, will have suo privato\r\nincommodo, quam minimo publico P. R., giving him the patriotic wish to\r\nrender light the odium by his own private loss, _rather than_ the least\r\npublic loss; or, by his own private loss, but if not, _by_ as small a\r\npublic loss as possible. Pop-_li_ R-_i_, better than _o_, _o_, as\r\n_liceret_ would, in the latter case, apply only to one of the parties;\r\nin the former both are understood.]\r\n\r\n22. On the following day the dictator sold the inhabitants of free\r\ncondition by auction: that was the only money applied to public use, not\r\nwithout resentment on the part of the people: and for the spoil they\r\nbrought home with them, they felt no obligation either to their\r\ncommander, who, in his search for abettors of his own parsimony, had\r\nreferred to the senate a matter within his own jurisdiction, or to the\r\nsenate, but to the Licinian family, of which the son had laid the matter\r\nbefore the senate, and the father had been the proposer of so popular a\r\nresolution. When all human wealth had been carried away from Veii, they\r\nthen began to remove the offerings to their gods and the gods\r\nthemselves, but more after the manner of worshippers than of plunderers.\r\nFor youths selected from the entire army, to whom the charge of\r\nconveying queen Juno to Rome was assigned, after having thoroughly\r\nwashed their bodies and arrayed themselves in white garments, entered\r\nher temple with profound adoration, applying their hands at first with\r\nreligious awe, because, according to the Etrurian usage, no one but a\r\npriest of a certain family had been accustomed to touch that statue.\r\nThen when some one, moved either by divine inspiration, or in youthful\r\njocularity, said, \"Juno, art thou willing to go to Rome,\" the rest\r\njoined in shouting that the goddess had nodded assent. To the story an\r\naddition was afterwards made, that her voice was heard, declaring that\r\n\"she was willing.\" Certain it is, we are informed that, having been\r\nraised from her place by machines of trifling power, she was light and\r\neasily removed, like as if she [willingly] followed; and that she was\r\nconveyed safe to the Aventine, her eternal seat, whither the vows of the\r\ndictator had invited her; where the same Camillus who had vowed it,\r\nafterwards dedicated a temple to her. Such was the fall of Veii, the\r\nwealthiest city of the Etrurian nation, which even in its final\r\noverthrow demonstrated its greatness; for having been besieged for ten\r\nsummers and winters without intermission, after it had inflicted\r\nconsiderably greater losses than it had sustained, eventually, fate now\r\nat length urging [its destruction], it was carried after all by the\r\ncontrivances of art, not by force.\r\n\r\n23. When news was brought to Rome that Veii was taken, although both\r\nthe prodigies had been expiated, and the answers of the prophets and the\r\nPythian responses were well known, and though they had selected as their\r\ncommander Marcus Furius, the greatest general of the day, which was\r\ndoing as much to promote success as could be done by human prudence; yet\r\nbecause the war had been carried on there for so many years with various\r\nsuccess, and many losses had been sustained, their joy was unbounded, as\r\nif for an event not expected; and before the senate could pass any\r\ndecree, all the temples were crowded with Roman matrons returning thanks\r\nto the gods. The senate decrees supplications for the space of four\r\ndays, a number of days greater than [was prescribed] in any former war.\r\nThe dictator's arrival also, all ranks pouring out to meet him, was\r\nbetter attended than that of any general before, and his triumph\r\nconsiderably surpassed all the ordinary style of honouring such a day.\r\nThe most conspicuous of all was himself, riding through the city in a\r\nchariot drawn by white horses; and that appeared unbecoming, not to say\r\na citizen, but even a human being. The people considered it an outrage\r\non religion that the dictator's equipage should emulate that of Jupiter\r\nand Apollo; and for that single reason his triumph was rather splendid\r\nthan pleasing. He then contracted for a temple for queen Juno on Mount\r\nAventine, and consecrated that of Mother Matuta: and, after having\r\nperformed these services to the gods and to mankind, he laid down his\r\ndictatorship. They then began to consider regarding the offering to\r\nApollo; and when Camillus stated that he had vowed the tenth part of the\r\nspoil to him, and the pontiff declared that the people ought to\r\ndischarge their own obligation, a plan was not readily struck out of\r\nordering the people to refund the spoil, so that the due proportion\r\nmight be set aside out of it for sacred purposes. At length they had\r\nrecourse to this which seemed the easiest course, that, whoever wished\r\nto acquit himself and his family of the religious obligation, after he\r\nhad made his own estimate of his portion of the plunder, should pay into\r\nthe treasury the value of the tenth part, so that out of it a golden\r\noffering worthy of the grandeur of the temple and the divinity of the\r\ngod might be made, suitable to the dignity of the Roman people. This\r\ncontribution also tended to alienate the affections of the commons from\r\nCamillus. During these transactions ambassadors came from the Volscians\r\nand Æquans to sue for peace; and peace was obtained, rather that the\r\nstate wearied by so tedious a war might obtain repose, than that the\r\npetitioners were deserving of it.\r\n\r\n24. After the capture of Veii, the following year had six military\r\ntribunes with consular power, the two Publii Cornelii, Cossus and\r\nScipio, Marcus Valerius Maximus a second time, Kæso Fabius Ambustus a\r\nthird time, Lucius Furius Medullinus a fifth time, Quintus Servilius a\r\nthird time. To the Cornelii the Faliscian war, to Valerius and Servilius\r\nthe Capenatian war, fell by lot. By them no cities were attempted by\r\nstorm or by siege, but the country was laid waste, and the plunder of\r\nthe effects on the lands was driven off; not a single fruit tree, not a\r\nvegetable was left on the land. These losses reduced the people of\r\nCapena; peace was granted to them on their suing for it. The war among\r\nthe Faliscians still continued. At Rome in the mean time sedition became\r\nmultiplied; and for the purpose of assuaging this they resolved that a\r\ncolony should be sent off to the Volscian country, for which three\r\nthousand Roman citizens should be enrolled; and the triumvirs appointed\r\nfor the purpose, distributed three acres and seven-twelfths to each man.\r\nThis donation began to be scorned, because they thought that it was\r\noffered as a solace for the disappointment of higher hopes. For why were\r\nthe commons to be sent into exile to the Volscians, when the magnificent\r\ncity of Veii was still in view, and the Veientian territory, more\r\nfertile and extensive than the Roman territor? The city also they\r\nextolled as preferable to the city of Rome, both in situation, in the\r\ngrandeur of its enclosures, and buildings, both public and private. Nay,\r\neven that scheme was proposed, which after the taking of Rome by the\r\nGauls was still more strongly urged, of removing to Veii. But they\r\ndestined Veii to be inhabited by half the commons and half the senate;\r\nand that two cities of one common republic might be inhabited by the\r\nRoman people.[167] When the nobles strove against these measures so\r\nstrenuously, as to declare \"that they would sooner die in the sight of\r\nthe Roman people, than that any of these things should be put to the\r\nvote; for that now in one city there were so many dissensions; what\r\nwould there be in two? Would any one prefer a vanquished to a victorious\r\ncity; and suffer Veii now after being captured to enjoy greater\r\nprosperity than it had before its capture? Lastly, that they may be\r\nforsaken in their country by their fellow-citizens; that no power should\r\never oblige them to forsake their country and fellow-citizens, and\r\nfollow Titus Licinius (for he was the tribune of the commons who\r\nproposed the measure) as a founder to Veii, abandoning the divine\r\nRomulus, the son of a god, the parent and founder of the city of Rome.\"\r\nWhen these proceedings were going on with shameful contentions, (for the\r\npatricians had drawn over, one half of the tribunes of the commons to\r\ntheir sentiments,) nothing else obliged the commons to refrain from\r\nviolence, but that whenever a clamour was set up for the purpose of\r\ncommencing a riot, the principal members of the senate, presenting\r\nthemselves among the foremost to the crowd, ordered that they themselves\r\nshould be attacked, struck, and put to death. Whilst they abstained from\r\nviolating their age, dignity, and honourable station, their respect for\r\nthem checked their rage even with respect to similar attempts on others.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 167: \"A proposal so absurd would have justified the most\r\nvehement opposition of the senate. But it is much more probable, that\r\nthe scope of the proposition was, that on this occasion the whole of the\r\nconquered land should be divided, but amongst the whole nation, so that\r\nthe patricians also and their clients should receive a share as absolute\r\nproperty.\"--_Neibuhr_, vol. ii. p. 248.]\r\n\r\n25. Camillus, at every opportunity and in all places, stated publicly,\r\n\"that this was not at all surprising; that the state was gone mad;\r\nwhich, though bound by a vow, yet felt greater concern in all other\r\nmatters than in acquitting itself of its religious obligations. He would\r\nsay nothing of the contribution of an alms more strictly speaking than\r\nof a tenth; since each man bound himself in his private capacity by it,\r\nthe public was set free. However, that his conscience would not permit\r\nhim to pass this over in silence, that out of that spoil only which\r\nconsisted of movable effects, a tenth was set apart; that no mention was\r\nmade of the city and captured land, which were also included in the\r\nvow.\" As the discussion of this point seemed difficult to the senate, it\r\nwas referred to the pontiffs; Camillus being invited [to the council],\r\nthe college decided, that whatever had belonged to the Veientians before\r\nthe uttering of the vow, and had come into the power of the Roman people\r\nafter the vow was made, of that a tenth part was sacred to Apollo. Thus\r\nthe city and land were brought into the estimate. The money was issued\r\nfrom the treasury, and the consular tribunes of the soldiers were\r\ncommissioned to purchase gold with it. And when there was not a\r\nsufficient quantity of this [metal], the matrons having held meetings to\r\ndeliberate on the subject, and by a general resolution having promised\r\nthe military tribunes their gold and all their ornaments, brought them\r\ninto the treasury. This circumstance was peculiarly grateful to the\r\nsenate, and they say that in return for this generosity the honour was\r\nconferred on the matrons, that they might use covered chariots [when\r\ngoing] to public worship and the games, and open chaises on festival and\r\ncommon days. A certain weight of gold being received from each and\r\nvalued, in order that the price might be paid for it, it was resolved\r\nthat a golden bowl should be made of it, which was to be carried to\r\nDelphos as an offering to Apollo. As soon as they disengaged their minds\r\nfrom the religious obligation, the tribunes of the commons renew their\r\nseditious practices; the populace are excited against all the nobles,\r\nbut above all against Camillus: that \"he by confiscating and\r\nconsecrating the plunder of Veii had reduced it to nothing.\" The absent\r\n[nobles] they abuse in violent terms: they evince a respect for them in\r\ntheir presence, when they voluntarily presented themselves to their\r\nfury. As soon as they perceived that the business would be protracted\r\nbeyond that year, they re-elect as tribunes of the commons for the\r\nfollowing year the same abettors of the law; and the patricians strove\r\nto accomplish the same thing with respect to those who were opponents of\r\nthe law. Thus the same persons in a great measure were re-elected\r\ntribunes of the commons.\r\n\r\n26. At the election of military tribunes the patricians succeeded by\r\ntheir utmost exertions in having Marcus Furius Camillus elected. They\r\npretended that he was wanted as a commander on account of the wars; but\r\nhe was intended as an opponent to the tribunes in their profusion. The\r\nmilitary tribunes with consular authority elected with Camillus were,\r\nLucius Furius Medullinus a sixth time, Caius Æmilius, Lucius Valerius\r\nPublicola, Spurius Postumius, Publius Cornelius a second time. At the\r\ncommencement of the year the tribunes of the commons took not a step\r\nuntil Marcus Furius Camillus should set out to the Faliscians, as that\r\nwar had been assigned to him. Then by delaying the project cooled; and\r\nCamillus, whom they chiefly dreaded as an antagonist, acquired an\r\nincrease of glory among the Faliscians. For when the enemy at first\r\nconfined themselves within the walls, considering it the safest plan, by\r\nlaying waste their lands and burning their houses, he compelled them to\r\ncome forth from the city; but their fears prevented them from proceeding\r\nto any considerable length. At about a mile from the town they pitch\r\ntheir camp; trusting that it was sufficiently secure from no other\r\ncause, than the difficulty of the approaches, the roads around being\r\nrough and craggy, in some parts narrow, in others steep. But Camillus\r\nhaving followed the direction of a prisoner belonging to the country as\r\nhis guide, decamping at an advanced hour of the night, at break of day\r\nshows himself on ground considerably higher [than theirs]. The Romans\r\nworked at the fortifications in three divisions: the rest of the army\r\nstood prepared for battle. There he routs and puts to flight the enemy\r\nwhen they attempted to interrupt his works; and such terror was struck\r\ninto the Faliscians in consequence, that, in their precipitate flight\r\npassing by their own camp which lay in their way, they made for the\r\ncity. Many were slain and wounded, before that in their panic they could\r\nmake their way through the gates. Their camp was taken; the spoil was\r\ngiven up to the quæstors, to the great dissatisfaction of the soldiers;\r\nbut overcome by the strictness of his authority, they both hated and\r\nadmired the same firmness of conduct. Then a regular siege of the city\r\ntook place, and the lines of circumvallation were carried on, and\r\nsometimes occasional attacks were made by the townsmen on the Roman\r\nposts, and slight skirmishes took place: and the time was spent, no hope\r\n[of success] inclining to either side, whilst corn and other provisions\r\nwere possessed in much greater abundance by the besieged than the\r\nbesiegers from [the store] which had been previously laid in. And their\r\ntoil appeared likely to prove just as tedious as it had at Veii, had not\r\nfortune presented to the Roman general at once both an opportunity for\r\ndisplaying his virtuous firmness of mind already tested in warlike\r\naffairs, and a speedy victory.\r\n\r\n27. It was the custom among the Faliscians to employ the same person as\r\npreceptor and private tutor for their children; and, as continues the\r\nusage to this day in Greece, several youths were intrusted to the care\r\nof one man. The person who appeared to excel in knowledge, instructed,\r\nas it is natural to suppose, the children of the leading men. As he had\r\nestablished it as a custom during peace to carry the boys out beyond the\r\ncity for the sake of play and of exercise; that custom not having been\r\ndiscontinued during the existence of the war; then drawing them away\r\nfrom the gate, sometimes in shorter, sometimes in longer excursions,\r\nadvancing farther than usual, when an opportunity offered, by varying\r\ntheir play and conversation, he led them on between the enemy's guards,\r\nand thence to the Roman camp into his tent to Camillus. There to the\r\natrocious act he added a still more atrocious speech: that \"he had\r\ndelivered Falerii into the hands of the Romans, when he put into their\r\npower those children, whose parents are there at the head of affairs.\"\r\nWhen Camillus heard this, he says, \"Wicked as thou art, thou hast come\r\nwith thy villanous offering neither to a people nor a commander like\r\nthyself. Between us and the Faliscians there exists not that form of\r\nsociety which is established by human compact; but between both there\r\ndoes exist, and ever will exist, that which nature has implanted. There\r\nare laws of war as well of peace; and we have learned to wage them\r\njustly not less than bravely. We carry arms not against that age which\r\nis spared even when towns are taken, but against men who are themselves\r\narmed, and who, not having been injured or provoked by us, attacked the\r\nRoman camp at Veii. Those thou hast surpassed, as far as lay in you, by\r\nan unprecedented act of villany: I shall conquer them, as I did Veii, by\r\nRoman arts, by bravery, labour, and by arms.\" Then having stripped him\r\nnaked, and tied his hands behind his back, he delivered him up to the\r\nboys to be brought back to Falerii; and supplied them with rods to\r\nscourge the traitor and drive him into the city. At which spectacle, a\r\ncrowd of people being assembled, afterwards the senate being convened by\r\nthe magistrates on the extraordinary circumstance, so great a change was\r\nproduced in their sentiments, that the entire state earnestly demanded\r\npeace at the hands of those, who lately, outrageous by hatred and anger,\r\nalmost preferred the fate of the Veientians to the peace of the\r\nCapenatians. The Roman faith, the justice of the commander, are cried up\r\nin the forum and in the senate-house; and by universal consent\r\nambassadors set out to the camp to Camillus, and thence by permission of\r\nCamillus to Rome to the senate, in order to deliver up Falerii. When\r\nintroduced before the senate, they are represented as having spoken\r\nthus: \"Conscript fathers, overcome by you and your commander by a\r\nvictory at which neither god nor man can feel displeasure, we surrender\r\nourselves to you, considering that we shall live more happily under your\r\nrule than under our own law, than which nothing can be more glorious for\r\na conqueror. In the result of this war, two salutary examples have been\r\nexhibited to mankind. You preferred faith in war to present victory: we,\r\nchallenged by your good faith, have voluntarily given up to you the\r\nvictory. We are under your sovereignty. Send men to receive our arms,\r\nour hostages, our city with its gates thrown open. You shall never have\r\nto repent of our fidelity, nor we of your dominion.\" Thanks were\r\nreturned to Camillus both by the enemy and by his own countrymen. Money\r\nwas required of the Faliscians to pay off the soldiers for that year,\r\nthat the Roman people might be relieved from the tribute. Peace being\r\ngranted, the army was led back to Rome.\r\n\r\n28. When Camillus returned home, signalized by much more solid glory\r\nthan when white horses had drawn him through the city, having vanquished\r\nthe enemy by justice and good faith, the senate did not conceal their\r\nsense of respect for him, but immediately set about acquitting him of\r\nhis vow; and Lucius Valerius, Lucius Sergius, Aulus Manlius, being sent\r\nin a ship of war as ambassadors to carry the golden bowl to Delphos as\r\nan offering to Apollo, were intercepted by the pirates of the Liparenses\r\nnot far from the Sicilian Strait, and carried to Liparæ. It was the\r\ncustom of the state to make a division of all booty which was acquired,\r\nas it were, by public piracy. On that year it so happened that one\r\nTimasitheus filled the office of chief magistrate, a man more like the\r\nRomans than his own countrymen. Who, himself reverencing the name of\r\nambassadors, and the offering, and the god to whom it was sent, and the\r\ncause of the offering, impressed the multitude also, who almost on all\r\noccasions resemble their ruler, with [a sense] of religious justice; and\r\nafter having brought the ambassadors to a public entertainment, escorted\r\nthem with the protection of some ships to Delphos, and from thence\r\nbrought them back in safety to Rome. By a decree of the senate a league\r\nof hospitality was formed with him, and presents were conferred on him\r\nby the state. During the same year the war with the Æquans was\r\nconducted with varying success; so that it was a matter of doubt both\r\namong the troops themselves and at Rome, whether they had been\r\nvictorious or were vanquished. The Roman commanders were Caius Æmilius\r\nand Spurius Postumius, two of the military tribunes. At first they acted\r\nin conjunction; then, after the enemy were routed in the field, it was\r\nagreed that Æmilius should take possession of Verrugo with a certain\r\nforce, and that Postumius should devastate the country. There, as the\r\nlatter proceeded rather negligently, and with his troops irregularly\r\ndrawn up, he was attacked by the Æquans, and an alarm being occasioned,\r\nhe was driven to the nearest hill; and the panic spread from thence to\r\nVerrugo to the other detachment of the army. When Postumius, having\r\nwithdrawn his men to a place of safety, summoned an assembly and\r\nupbraided them with their fright and flight; with having been beaten by\r\na most cowardly and dastardly enemy; the entire army shout aloud that\r\nthey deserved to hear all this, and admitted the disgrace they had\r\nincurred; but [they promised] that they would make amends, and that the\r\nenemy's joy should not be of long duration. Demanding that he would\r\ninstantly lead them from thence to the camp of the enemy, (this lay in\r\nthe plain within their view,) they submitted to any punishment, if they\r\ndid not take it before night. Having praised them, he orders them to\r\ntake refreshment, and to be in readiness at the fourth watch. And the\r\nenemy, in order to prevent the flight of the Romans from the hill\r\nthrough the road which led to Verrugo, were posted to meet them; and the\r\nbattle commenced before daylight, (but the moon was up all the night,)\r\nand was not more confused than a battle fought by day. But the shout\r\nhaving reached Verrugo, when they thought that the Roman camp was\r\nattacked, occasioned such a panic, that in spite of the entreaties of\r\nÆmilius and his efforts to stop them, they fled to Tusculum in great\r\ndisorder. From thence a report was carried to Rome that \"Postumius and\r\nhis army were cut to pieces.\" When the dawn of day had removed all\r\napprehension of an ambuscade in case of a hasty pursuit, after riding\r\nthrough the ranks, by demanding [the performance of] their promises he\r\ninfused such ardour into them, that the Æquans could no longer withstand\r\ntheir impetuosity. Then the slaughter of them in their flight, such as\r\ntakes place when matters are conducted more under the influence of\r\nanger than of courage, was continued even to the total destruction of\r\nthe enemy, and the melancholy news from Tusculum, the state having been\r\nalarmed without cause, was followed by a letter from Postumius decked\r\nwith laurel, (announcing) that \"the victory belonged to the Roman\r\npeople; that the army of the Æquans was destroyed.\"\r\n\r\n29. As the proceedings of the plebeian tribunes had not yet attained a\r\ntermination, both the commons exerted themselves to continue their\r\noffice for the promoters of the law, and the patricians to re-elect the\r\nopponents of the law; but the commons were more successful in the\r\nelection of their own magistrates. Which annoyance the patricians\r\navenged by passing a decree of the senate that consuls should be\r\nelected, magistrates detested by the commons. After an interval of\r\nfifteen years, Lucius Lucretius Flavus and Servius Sulpicius Camerinus\r\nwere appointed consuls. In the beginning of this year, whilst the\r\ntribunes of the commons united their efforts to pass the law, because\r\nnone of their college were likely to oppose them, and the consuls\r\nresisted them with no less energy, the Æquans storm Vitellia, a Roman\r\ncolony in their territory. The chief part of the colonists made their\r\nway in safety to Rome, because the town, having been taken by treachery\r\nin the night, afforded an unimpeded mode of escape by the remote side of\r\nthe city. That province fell to the lot of Lucius Lucretius the consul.\r\nHe having set out with his army, vanquished the enemy in the field; and\r\nreturned victorious to Rome to a much more serious contest. A day of\r\ntrial had been appointed for Aulus Virginius and Quintus Pomponius,\r\nplebeian tribunes of the two preceding years, in whose defence by the\r\ncombined power of the patricians, the honour of the senate was involved.\r\nFor no one laid against them any other impeachment, either of their mode\r\nof life or of their conduct in office, save that, to gratify the\r\npatricians, they had protested against the tribunitian law. The\r\nresentment of the commons, however, prevailed over the influence of the\r\nsenate; and by a most pernicious precedent these men, though innocent,\r\nwere condemned [to pay a fine of] ten thousand _asses_ in weight. At\r\nthis the patricians were very much incensed. Camillus openly charged the\r\ncommons with gross violation of duty, \"who, now turning their venom\r\nagainst their own body, did not feel that by their iniquitous sentence\r\non the tribune they abolished the right of protesting; that abolishing\r\nthis right of protesting, they had upset the tribunitian authority. For\r\nthey were mistaken in expecting that the patricians would tolerate the\r\nunbridled licentiousness of that office. If tribunitian violence could\r\nnot be repelled by tribunitian aid, that the patricians would find out\r\nsome other weapon.\" The consuls he also blamed, because they had in\r\nsilence suffered those tribunes who had followed the authority of the\r\nsenate to be deceived by [their reliance] on the public faith. By openly\r\nexpressing these sentiments, he every day still further exasperated the\r\nangry feelings of the people.\r\n\r\n30. But he ceased not to urge the senate to oppose the law; \"that when\r\nthe day for proposing the law had arrived they should go down to the\r\nforum with no other feeling than as men who remembered that they had to\r\ncontend for their altars and homes, and the temples of the gods, and the\r\nsoil in which they had been born. For that as far as he himself\r\nindividually was concerned, if during this contest [to be sustained] by\r\nhis country it were allowable for him to think of his own glory, it\r\nwould even reflect honour on himself, that a city captured by him should\r\nbe densely inhabited, that he would daily enjoy the monument of his\r\nglory, and that he would have before his eyes a city borne by him in his\r\ntriumph, that all would tread in the footsteps of his renown. But that\r\nhe deemed it an impiety that a city deserted and forsaken by the\r\nimmortal gods should be inhabited; that the Roman people should reside\r\nin a captive soil, and that a vanquished should be taken in exchange for\r\na victorious country.\" Stimulated by these exhortations of their leader,\r\nthe patricians, both young and old, entered the forum in a body, when\r\nthe law was about to be proposed: and dispersing themselves through the\r\ntribes, each earnestly appealing to the members of their own tribe,\r\nbegan to entreat them with tears \"not to desert that country for which\r\nthey themselves and their fathers had fought most valiantly and\r\nsuccessfully,\" pointing to the Capitol, the temple of Vesta, and the\r\nother temples of the gods around; \"not to drive the Roman people, exiles\r\nand outcasts, from their native soil and household gods into the city of\r\nthe enemy; and not to bring matters to such a state, that it was better\r\nthat Veii were not taken, lest Rome should be deserted.\" Because they\r\nproceeded not by violence, but by entreaties, and in the midst of these\r\nentreaties frequent mention was [made] of the gods, the greatest part\r\n[of the people] were influenced by religious scruples: and more tribes\r\nby one rejected the law than voted for it. And so gratifying was this\r\nvictory to the patricians, that on the following day, on a motion made\r\nby the consuls, a decree of the senate was passed, that seven acres a\r\nman of Veientian territory should be distributed to the commons; and not\r\nonly to the fathers of families, but so that all persons in their house\r\nin a state of freedom should be considered, and that they might be\r\nwilling to rear up their children with that prospect.\r\n\r\n31. The commons being won over by such a boon, no opposition was made to\r\nholding the elections for consuls. Lucius Valerius Potitus, and Marcus\r\nManlius, who afterwards obtained the surname of Capitolinus, were\r\nelected consuls. These consuls celebrated the great games which Marcus\r\nFurius, when dictator, had vowed in the Veientian war. In the same year\r\nthe temple of imperial Juno, vowed by the same dictator and during the\r\nsame war, is dedicated; and they state that the dedication was attended\r\nwith great zeal by the matrons. A war scarcely worth mentioning was\r\nwaged with the Æquans at Algidum, the enemies taking to flight almost\r\nbefore they commenced the fight. To Valerius, because he was more\r\npersevering in slaughtering them in their flight, a triumph was granted;\r\nit was decreed that Manlius should enter the city with an ovation. The\r\nsame year a new war broke out with the Volsinians; whither an army could\r\nnot be led, on account of a famine and pestilence in the Roman\r\nterritories, which arose from drought and excessive heat; on account of\r\nwhich the Volsinians forming a junction with the Salpinians, being\r\nelated with pride, made an unprovoked incursion into the Roman\r\nterritories. War was then proclaimed against the two states. Caius\r\nJulius died during his censorship; Marcus Cornelius was substituted in\r\nhis room; a proceeding which was afterwards considered as offensive to\r\nreligion; because during that lustrum Rome was taken. Nor since that\r\ntime has a censor ever been substituted in the room of one deceased. And\r\nthe consuls being seized by the distemper, it was determined that the\r\nauspices should be taken anew during an interregnum.\r\n\r\n32. Therefore when in pursuance of a decree of the senate the consuls\r\nresigned their office, Marcus Furius Camillus is created interrex, who\r\nappointed Publius Cornelius Scipio interrex, and he afterwards Lucius\r\nValerius Potitus. By him were appointed six military tribunes with\r\nconsular power; so that, though any one of them should be incommoded by\r\nbad health, the state might have a sufficient number of magistrates. On\r\nthe calends of July, the following entered on their office, Lucius\r\nLucretius, Servius Sulpicius, Marcus Æmilius, Lucius Furius Medullinus a\r\nseventh time, Agrippa Furius, Caius Æmilius a second time. Of these,\r\nLucius Lucretius and Caius Æmilius got the Volsinians as their province;\r\nthe Salpinians fell to the lot of Agrippa Furius and Servius Sulpicius.\r\nThe first engagement was with the Volsinians. The war, important from\r\nthe number of the enemy, was without difficulty brought to a close. At\r\nthe first onset, their army was put to flight. Eight thousand soldiers,\r\nhemmed in by the cavalry, laid down their arms and surrendered. The\r\naccount received of that war had the effect of preventing the Salpinians\r\nfrom hazarding an engagement; the troops secured themselves within their\r\ntowns. The Romans drove spoil in every direction, both from the\r\nSalpinian and Volsinian territory, there being no one to repel that\r\naggression; until a truce for twenty years was granted to the\r\nVolsinians, exhausted by the war, on this condition, that they should\r\nmake restitution to the Roman people, and furnish the pay of the army\r\nfor that year. During the same year, Marcus Cædicius, a plebeian,\r\nannounced to the tribunes that in the New Street, where the chapel now\r\nstands, above the temple of Vesta, he had heard in the silence of the\r\nnight a voice louder than that of a human being, which ordered the\r\nmagistrates to be told, that the Gauls were approaching. This, as is\r\nusual, was disregarded, on account of the humble station of the author,\r\nand also because the nation was a remote one, and therefore the less\r\nknown. And not only were the warnings of the gods disregarded, fate now\r\nimpending; but further, the only human aid which was left them, Marcus\r\nFurius, they drove away from the city; who, on a day [of trial] being\r\nappointed for him by Lucius Appuleius, a tribune of the people, in\r\nreference to the Veientian spoil, he having also lost his son, a young\r\nman, about the same time, when he summoned to his house the members of\r\nhis tribe and his dependents, (they constituted a considerable portion\r\nof the commons,) and having sounded their sentiments, he received for\r\nanswer, \"that they would contribute whatever fine he should be condemned\r\nto pay; that to acquit him they were unable,\"[168] retired into exile;\r\nafter praying to the immortal gods, \"that if that outrage was done to\r\nhim without his deserving it, they would at the earliest opportunity\r\ngive cause to his ungrateful country to regret his absence.\" In his\r\nabsence he was fined fifteen thousand _asses_ in weight.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 168: Niebuhr and Arnold understand these words to signify,\r\nthat these persons had already made up their minds not to acquit him, or\r\nassist him by voting in favour of him--in fact, that they could not\r\nconscientiously do so. It may, however, signify simply, that the people\r\nwere so incensed against him, that there existed not a rational prospect\r\nof acquittal for him.]\r\n\r\n33. That citizen being driven away, who being present, Rome could not be\r\ncaptured, if any thing is certain regarding human affairs; the destined\r\nruin now approaching the city, ambassadors came from the Clusinians,\r\nsoliciting aid against the Gauls. A report is current that that nation,\r\nallured by the delightfulness of the crops, and more especially of the\r\nwine, an enjoyment then new to them, crossed the Alps, and took\r\npossession of the lands formerly cultivated by the Etrurians; and that\r\nAruns, a native of Clusium, introduced wine into Gaul for the purpose of\r\nenticing the nation, through resentment for his wife's having been\r\ndebauched by Lucumo, whose guardian he himself had been, a very\r\ninfluential young man, and on whom vengeance could not be taken, unless\r\nforeign aid were resorted to; that this person served as a guide to them\r\nwhen crossing the Alps, and advised them to lay siege to Clusium. I\r\nwould not indeed deny that the Gauls were brought to Clusium by Aruns or\r\nany other native of Clusium; but that those persons who laid siege to\r\nClusium were not they who first crossed the Alps, is sufficiently\r\ncertain. For two hundred years before they laid siege to Clusium and\r\ncaptured the city of Rome, the Gauls passed over into Italy. Nor were\r\nthese the first of the Etrurians with whom the Gauls fought, but long\r\nbefore that they frequently fought with those who dwelt between the\r\nApennines and the Alps. Before the Roman empire the sway of the Tuscans\r\nwas much extended by land and by sea; how very powerful they were in\r\nthe upper and lower seas, by which Italy is encompassed like an island,\r\nthe names [of these seas] is a proof; the one of which the Italian\r\nnations have called the Tuscan sea, the general appellation of the\r\npeople; the other the Hadriatic, from Hadria, a colony of Tuscans. The\r\nGreeks call these same seas the Tyrrhenian and Hadriatic. This people\r\ninhabited the country extending to both seas in twelve cities, colonies\r\nequal in number to the mother cities having been sent, first on this\r\nside the Apennines towards the lower sea, afterwards to the other side\r\nof the Apennines; who obtained possession of all the district beyond the\r\nPo, even as far as the Alps, except the corner of the Venetians, who\r\ndwell round the extreme point of the [Hadriatic] sea. The Alpine nations\r\nalso have this origin, more especially the Rhætians; whom their very\r\nsituation has rendered savage, so as to retain nothing of their\r\noriginal, except the accent of their language, and not even that without\r\ncorruption.\r\n\r\n34. Concerning the passage of the Gauls into Italy we have heard as\r\nfollows. In the reign of Tarquinius Priscus at Rome, the supreme\r\ngovernment of the Celts, who compose the third part of Gaul, was in the\r\nhands of the Biturigians: they gave a king to the Celtic nation. This\r\nwas Ambigatus, one very much distinguished by his merit, and both his\r\ngreat prosperity in his own concerns and in those of the public; for\r\nunder his administration Gaul was so fruitful and so well peopled, that\r\nso very great a population appeared scarcely capable of being restrained\r\nby any government. He being now advanced in years, and anxious to\r\nrelieve his kingdom of so oppressive a crowd, declares his intention to\r\nsend his sister's sons, Bellovesus and Sigovesus, two enterprising\r\nyouths, into whatever settlements the gods should grant them by augury:\r\nthat they should take out with them as great a number of men as they\r\npleased, so that no nation might be able to obstruct them in their\r\nprogress. Then to Sigovesus the Hercynian forest was assigned by the\r\noracle: to Bellovesus the gods marked out a much more cheering route\r\ninto Italy. He carried out with him from the Biturigians, the\r\nArvernians, the Senonians, the Æduans, the Ambarrians, the Carnutians,\r\nand the Aulercians, all that was superfluous in their population. Having\r\nset out with an immense force of horse and foot, he arrived in the\r\ncountry of the Tricastinians. Next the Alps were opposed [to their\r\nprogress], and I am not surprised that they should seem impassable, as\r\nthey had never been climbed over through any path as yet, as far at\r\nleast as tradition can extend, unless we are disposed to believe the\r\nstories regarding Hercules. When the height of the mountains kept the\r\nGauls there penned up as it were, and they were looking around [to\r\ndiscover] by what path they might pass into another world between the\r\nsummits, which joined the sky, a religious scruple detained them, it\r\nhaving been announced to them that strangers in search of lands were\r\nattacked by the nation of the Salyans. These were the Massilians, who\r\nhad come by sea from Phocæa. The Gauls considering this an omen of their\r\nown fortune, assisted them in fortifying the ground which they had taken\r\npossession of on their first landing, covered with spacious woods. They\r\nthemselves crossed the Alps through the Taurinian and pathless forests;\r\nand having defeated the Etrurians not far from the Ticinus, on hearing\r\nthat the land in which they had posted themselves was called Insubria,\r\nthe same name as the Insubres, a canton of the Ædui: embracing the omen\r\nof the place, they built a city there, and called it Mediolanum.\r\n\r\n35. Some time after another body, consisting of Cenomanians, having\r\nfollowed the tracks of the former under the conduct of Elitovius,\r\ncrossed the Alps through the same forest, with the aid of Bellovesus,\r\nand settle themselves where the cities of Brixia and Verona now stand\r\n(the Libuans then possessed these places). After these came the\r\nSalluvians, who fix themselves near the ancient canton of the Ligurians\r\ncalled Lævi, inhabiting the banks of the Ticinus. Next the Boians and\r\nLingonians, having made their way over through the Penine pass, all the\r\ntract between the Po and the Alps being occupied, crossed the Po on\r\nrafts, and drove out of the country not only the Etrurians, but the\r\nUmbrians also: they confined themselves however within the Apennines.\r\nThen the Senonians, the latest of these emigrants, took possession of\r\nthe track [extending] from the Utens to the Æsis. I find that it was\r\nthis nation that came to Clusium, and thence to Rome; whether alone, or\r\naided by all the nations of the Cisalpine Gauls, is not duly\r\nascertained. The Clusians, terrified at their strange enemy, on\r\nbeholding their great numbers, the forms of the men such as they had\r\nnever seen, and the kind of arms [they carried], and on hearing that\r\nthe troops of the Etrurians had been frequently defeated by them on both\r\nsides of the Po, sent ambassadors to Rome to solicit aid from the\r\nsenate, though they had no claim on the Roman people, in respect either\r\nof alliance or friendship, except that they had not defended their\r\nrelations the Veientians against the Roman people. No aid was obtained:\r\nthree ambassadors were sent, sons of Marcus Fabius Ambustus, to treat\r\nwith the Gauls in the name of the senate and Roman people; that they\r\nshould not attack the allies and friends of the Roman people from whom\r\nthey had received no wrong. That they should be supported by the Romans\r\neven by force of arms, if circumstances obliged them; but it seemed\r\nbetter that war itself should be kept aloof, if possible; and that the\r\nGauls, a nation strangers to them, should be known by peace, rather than\r\nby arms.\r\n\r\n36. The embassy was a mild one, had it not been consigned to ambassadors\r\ntoo hot in temper, and who resembled Gauls more than Romans. To whom,\r\nafter they delivered their commission in the assembly of the Gauls, the\r\nfollowing answer is returned: Though the name of the Romans was new to\r\ntheir ears, yet they believed them to be brave men, whose aid was\r\nimplored by the Clusians in their perilous conjuncture. And since they\r\nchose to defend their allies against them by negociation rather than by\r\narms, that they on their part would not reject the pacific terms which\r\nthey propose, if the Clusians would give up to the Gauls in want of\r\nland, a portion of their territories which they possessed to a greater\r\nextent than they could cultivate; otherwise peace could not be obtained:\r\nthat they wished to receive an answer in presence of the Romans; and if\r\nthe land were refused them, that they would decide the matter with the\r\nsword in presence of the same Romans; that they might have an\r\nopportunity of carrying home an account how much the Gauls excelled all\r\nother mortals in bravery. On the Romans asking what right they had to\r\ndemand land from the possessors, or to threaten war [in case of\r\nrefusal], and what business the Gauls had in Etruria, and on their\r\nfiercely replying, that they carried their right in their swords, that\r\nall things were the property of the brave, with minds inflamed on both\r\nsides they severally have recourse to arms, and the battle is commenced.\r\nHere, fate now pressing hard on the Roman city, the ambassadors,\r\ncontrary to the law of nations, take up arms; nor could this be done in\r\nsecret, as three of the noblest and bravest of the Roman youth fought in\r\nthe van of the Etrurians; so conspicuous was the valour of the\r\nforeigners. Moreover Quintus Fabius, riding out beyond the line, slew a\r\ngeneral of the Gauls who was furiously charging the very standards of\r\nthe Etrurians, having run him through the side with his spear: and the\r\nGauls recognised him when stripping him of his spoils; and a signal was\r\ngiven throughout the entire line that he was a Roman ambassador. Giving\r\nup therefore their resentment against the Clusians, they sound a\r\nretreat, threatening the Romans. Some gave it as their opinion that they\r\nshould proceed forthwith to Rome. The seniors prevailed, that\r\nambassadors should be sent to complain of the injuries done them, and to\r\ndemand that the Fabii should be given up to them in satisfaction for\r\nhaving violated the law of nations. When the ambassadors had stated\r\nmatters, according to the instructions given to them, the conduct of the\r\nFabii was neither approved by the senate, and the barbarians seemed to\r\nthem to demand what was just: but in the case of men of such station\r\nparty favour prevented them from decreeing that which they felt to be\r\nright. Wherefore lest the blame of any misfortune, which might happen to\r\nbe received in a war with the Gauls, should lie with them, they refer\r\nthe consideration of the demands of the Gauls to the people, where\r\ninfluence and wealth were so predominant, that those persons, whose\r\npunishment was under consideration, were elected military tribunes with\r\nconsular power for the ensuing year. At which proceeding the Gauls being\r\nenraged, as was very natural, openly menacing war, return to their own\r\nparty. With the three Fabii the military tribunes elected were Quintus\r\nSulpicius Longus, Quintus Servilius a fourth time, Servius Cornelius\r\nMaluginensis.\r\n\r\n37. Though danger of such magnitude was impending (so completely does\r\nFortune blind the minds of men when she wishes not her threatening\r\nstroke to be foiled) a state, which against the Fidenatian and Veientian\r\nenemies, and other neighbouring states, had recourse to aid even from\r\nthe most extreme quarters, and had appointed a dictator on many trying\r\noccasions, that same state now, when an enemy, never before seen or\r\nheard of, from the ocean and remotest regions of the earth, was\r\nadvancing in arms against them, looked not for any extraordinary command\r\nor aid. Tribunes, by whose temerity the war had been brought on them,\r\nwere appointed to the chief direction of affairs, and even making less\r\nof the war than fame had represented it, held the levy with no greater\r\ndiligence than used to be exercised for ordinary wars. In the mean while\r\nthe Gauls, on hearing that honour was even conferred on the violators of\r\nhuman law, and that their embassy was slighted, inflamed with\r\nresentment, over which that nation has no control, immediately snatched\r\nup their standards, and enter on their march with the utmost expedition.\r\nWhen the cities, alarmed at the tumult occasioned by them as they passed\r\nprecipitately along, began to run to arms, and the peasants took to\r\nflight, they indicated by a loud shout that they were proceeding to\r\nRome, taking up an immense space of ground, wherever they passed, with\r\ntheir horses and men, their troops spreading widely in every direction.\r\nBut fame and the messengers of the Clusians, and then of the other\r\nstates one after another, preceding them, the rapid advance of the enemy\r\nbrought the greatest consternation to Rome; for, with their tumultuary\r\ntroops hastily led on, they met them within the distance of the eleventh\r\nmile-stone, where the river Allia, descending from the Crustuminian\r\nmountains in a very deep channel, joins the river Tiber not far below\r\nthe road. Already all places in front and on each side were crowded with\r\nthe enemy, and this nation, which has a natural turn for causeless\r\nconfusion, by their harsh music and discordant clamours, filled all\r\nplaces with a horrible din.\r\n\r\n38. There the military tribunes, without having previously selected a\r\nplace for their camp, without having previously raised a rampart to\r\nwhich they might have a retreat, unmindful of their duty to the gods, to\r\nsay nothing of that to man, without taking auspices or offering\r\nsacrifices, draw up their line, which was extended towards the flanks,\r\nlest they should be surrounded by the great numbers of the enemy. Still\r\ntheir front could not be made equal to that of the enemy, though by\r\nthinning their line they rendered their centre weak and scarcely\r\nconnected. There was on the right a small eminence, which it was\r\ndetermined to fill with bodies of reserve; and that circumstance, as it\r\nwas the first cause of their dismay and flight, so it proved their only\r\nmeans of safety in their flight. For Brennus, the chieftain of the\r\nGauls, being chiefly apprehensive of some design[169] being intended in\r\nthe small number of the enemy, thinking that the high ground had been\r\nseized for this purpose, that, when the Gauls had been engaged in front\r\nwith the line of the legions, the reserve was to make an attack on their\r\nrear and flank, directed his troops against the reserve; certain, that\r\nif he had dislodged them from their ground, the victory would be easy in\r\nthe plain for a force which had so much the advantage in point of\r\nnumbers: thus not only fortune, but judgment also stood on the side of\r\nthe barbarians. In the opposite army there appeared nothing like Romans,\r\neither in the commanders, or in the soldiers. Terror and dismay had\r\ntaken possession of their minds, and such a forgetfulness of every\r\nthing, that a far greater number of them fled to Veii, a city of their\r\nenemy, though the Tiber stood in their way, than by the direct road to\r\nRome, to their wives and children. Their situation defended the reserve\r\nfor some time; throughout the remainder of the line as soon as the shout\r\nwas heard, by those who stood nearest on their flank, and by those at a\r\ndistance on their rear, almost before they could look at the enemy as\r\nyet untried, not only without attempting to fight, but without even\r\nreturning the shout, fresh and unhurt they took to flight. Nor was there\r\nany slaughter of them in the act of fighting; but their rear was cut to\r\npieces, whilst they obstructed their flight by their struggling one with\r\nanother. Great slaughter was made on the bank of the Tiber, whither the\r\nentire left wing, having thrown down their arms, directed their flight;\r\nand many who did not know how to swim, or were exhausted, being weighed\r\ndown by their coats of mail and other defensive armour, were swallowed\r\nup in the current. The greatest part however escaped safe to Veii;\r\nwhence not only no reinforcement, but not even an account of their\r\ndefeat, was forwarded to Rome. Those on the right wing which had been\r\nposted at a distance from the river, and rather near the foot of the\r\nmountain, all made for Rome, and, without even shutting the gates, fled\r\ninto the citadel.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 169: In my translation of this passage I have differed from\r\nBaker, who thus renders: \"thinking, that as his enemies were few in\r\nnumber, their skill was what he had chiefly to guard against.\" Dureau De\r\nLamalle thus translates: \"supposant de la ruse aux ennemis, a raison de\r\nleur petit nombre.\" This is obviously the correct version.]\r\n\r\n39. The miraculous attainment of so sudden a victory held even the Gauls\r\nin a state of stupefaction. And at first they stood motionless with\r\npanic, as if not knowing what had happened; then they apprehended a\r\nstratagem; at length they began to collect the spoils of the slain, and\r\nto pile up the arms in heaps, as is their custom. Then, at length, when\r\nno appearance of any thing hostile was any where observed, having\r\nproceeded on their journey, they reach the city of Rome not long before\r\nsun-set: where when some horsemen, who had advanced before, brought back\r\nword that the gates were not shut, that no guard was posted before the\r\ngates, no armed troops on the walls, another cause of amazement similar\r\nto the former made them halt; and dreading the night and ignorance of\r\nthe situation of the city, they posted themselves between Rome and the\r\nAnio, after sending scouts about the walls and the several gates to\r\nascertain what plans the enemy would adopt in their desperate\r\ncircumstances. With respect to the Romans, as the greater part had gone\r\nto Veii from the field of battle, and no one supposed that any survived\r\nexcept those who had fled back to Rome, being all lamented as lost, both\r\nthose living and those dead, they caused the entire city to be filled\r\nwith wailings. The alarm for the public interest stifled private sorrow,\r\nas soon as it was announced that the enemy were at hand. Presently the\r\nbarbarians patrolling around the walls in troops, they heard their yells\r\nand the dissonant clangour of their arms. All the interval up to the\r\nnext day kept their minds in such a state of suspense, that an assault\r\nseemed every moment about to be made on the city: on their first\r\napproach, when they arrived at the city, [it was expected;] for if this\r\nwere not their design, that they would have remained at the Allia; then\r\ntowards sunset, because there was not much of the day remaining, they\r\nimagined that they would attack them before night; then that the design\r\nwas deferred until night, in order to strike the greater terror. At\r\nlength the approach of light struck them with dismay; and the calamity\r\nitself followed closely upon their continued apprehension of it, when\r\nthe troops entered the gates in hostile array. During that night,\r\nhowever, and the following day, the state by no means bore any\r\nresemblance to that which which had fled in so dastardly a manner at the\r\nAllia. For as there was not a hope that the city could be defended, so\r\nsmall a number of troops now remaining, it was determined that the\r\nyouth fit for military service, and the abler part of the senate with\r\ntheir wives and children, should retire into the citadel and Capitol;\r\nand having collected stores of arms and corn, and thence from a\r\nfortified post, that they should defend the deities, and the\r\ninhabitants, and the Roman name: that the flamen [Quirinalis] and the\r\nvestal priestesses should carry away far from slaughter and\r\nconflagration the objects appertaining to the religion of the state: and\r\nthat their worship should not be intermitted, until there remained no\r\none who should continue it. If the citadel and Capitol, the mansion of\r\nthe gods, if the senate, the source of public counsel, if the youth of\r\nmilitary age, should survive the impending ruin of the city, the loss\r\nwould be light of the aged, the crowd left behind in the city, and who\r\nwere sure to perish[170] under any circumstances. And in order that the\r\nplebeian portion of the multitude might bear the thing with greater\r\nresignation, the aged men, who had enjoyed triumphs and consulships,\r\nopenly declared that they would die along with them, and that they would\r\nnot burden the scanty stores of the armed men with those bodies, with\r\nwhich they were now unable to bear arms, or to defend their country.\r\nSuch was the consolation addressed to each other by the aged now\r\ndestined to death.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 170: The aged were doomed to perish under any circumstances,\r\n(_utique_,) from scarcity of provisions, whether they retired into the\r\nCapitol with the military youth, or were left behind in the city.]\r\n\r\n40. Their exhortations were then turned to the band of young men, whom\r\nthey escorted to the Capitol and citadel, commending to their valour and\r\nyouth whatever might be the remaining fortune of a city, which for three\r\nhundred and sixty years had been victorious in all its wars. When those\r\nwho carried with them all their hope and resources, parted with the\r\nothers, who had determined not to survive the ruin of their captured\r\ncity; both the circumstance itself and the appearance [it exhibited] was\r\nreally distressing, and also the weeping of the women, and their\r\nundecided running together, following now these, now those, and asking\r\ntheir husbands and children what was to become of them, [all together]\r\nleft nothing that could be added to human misery. A great many of them,\r\nhowever, escorted their friends into the citadel, no one either\r\npreventing or inviting them; because the measure which was advantageous\r\nto the besieged, that of reducing the number of useless persons, was but\r\nlittle in accordance with humanity. The rest of the crowd, chiefly\r\nplebeians, whom so small a hill could not contain, nor could they be\r\nsupported amid such a scarcity of corn, pouring out of the city as if in\r\none continued train, repaired to the Janiculum. From thence some were\r\ndispersed through the country, some made for the neighbouring cities,\r\nwithout any leader or concert, following each his own hopes, his own\r\nplans, those of the public being given up as lost. In the mean time the\r\nFlamen Quirinalis and the vestal virgins, laying aside all concern for\r\ntheir own affairs, consulting which of the sacred deposits should be\r\ncarried with them, which should be left behind, for they had not\r\nstrength to carry them all, or what place would best preserve them in\r\nsafe custody, consider it best to put them into casks and to bury them\r\nin the chapel adjoining to the residence of the Flamen Quirinalis, where\r\nnow it is profane to spit out. The rest they carry away with them, after\r\ndividing the burden among themselves, by the road which leads by the\r\nSublician bridge to the Janiculum. When Lucius Albinius, a Roman\r\nplebeian, who was conveying his wife and children in a waggon, beheld\r\nthem on that ascent among the rest of the crowd which was leaving the\r\ncity as unfit to carry arms; even then the distinction of things divine\r\nand human being preserved, considering it an outrage on religion, that\r\nthe public priests and sacred utensils of the Roman people should go on\r\nfoot and be carried, that he and his family should be seen in a\r\ncarriage, he commanded his wife and children to alight, placed the\r\nvirgins and sacred utensils in the vehicle, and carried them on to Cære,\r\nwhither the priests had intended to go.\r\n\r\n41. Meanwhile at Rome all arrangements being now made, as far as was\r\npossible in such an emergency, for the defence of the citadel, the crowd\r\nof aged persons having returned to their houses, awaited the enemy's\r\ncoming with minds firmly prepared for death. Such of them as had borne\r\ncurule offices, in order that they may die in the insignia of their\r\nformer station, honours, and merit, arraying themselves in the most\r\nmagnificent garments worn by those drawing the chariots of the gods in\r\nprocession, or by persons riding in triumph, seated themselves in their\r\nivory chairs, in the middle of their halls. Some say that they devoted\r\nthemselves for their country and the citizens of Rome, Marcus Fabius,\r\nthe chief pontiff, dictating the form of words. The Gauls, both because\r\nby the intervention of the night they had abated all angry feelings\r\narising from the irritation of battle, and because they had on no\r\noccasion fought a well-disputed fight, and were then not taking the city\r\nby storm or violence, entering the city the next day, free from\r\nresentment or heat of passion, through the Colline gate which lay open,\r\nadvance into the forum, casting their eyes around on the temples of the\r\ngods, and on the citadel, which alone exhibited any appearance of war.\r\nFrom thence, after leaving a small guard, lest any attack should be made\r\non them whilst scattered, from the citadel or Capitol, they dispersed in\r\nquest of plunder; the streets being entirely desolate, rush some of them\r\nin a body into the houses that were nearest; some repair to those which\r\nwere most distant, considering these to be untouched and abounding with\r\nspoil. Afterwards being terrified by the very solitude, lest any\r\nstratagem of the enemy should surprise them whilst being dispersed, they\r\nreturned in bodies into the forum and the parts adjoining to the forum,\r\nwhere the houses of the commons being shut, and the halls of the leading\r\nmen lying open, almost greater backwardness was felt to attack the open\r\nthan the shut houses; so completely did they behold with a sort of\r\nveneration men sitting in the porches of the palaces, who besides their\r\nornaments and apparel more august than human, bore a striking\r\nresemblance to gods, in the majesty which their looks and the gravity of\r\ntheir countenance displayed. Whilst they stood gazing on these as on\r\nstatues, it is said that Marcus Papirius, one of them, roused the anger\r\nof a Gaul by striking him on the head with his ivory, while he was\r\nstroking his beard, which was then universally worn long; and that the\r\ncommencement of the bloodshed began with him, that the rest were slain\r\nin their seats. After the slaughter of the nobles, no person whatever\r\nwas spared; the houses were plundered, and when emptied were set on\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n42. But whether it was that all were not possessed with a desire of\r\ndestroying the city, or it had been so determined by the leading men of\r\nthe Gauls, both that some fires should be presented to their view, [to\r\nsee] if the besieged could be forced into a surrender through affection\r\nfor their dwellings, and that all the houses should not be burned down,\r\nso that whatever portion should remain of the city, they might hold as\r\na pledge to work upon the minds of the enemy; the fire by no means\r\nspread either indiscriminately or extensively on the first day, as is\r\nusual in a captured city. The Romans beholding from the citadel the city\r\nfilled with the enemy, and their running to and fro through all the\r\nstreets, some new calamity presenting itself in every different quarter,\r\nwere neither able to preserve their presence of mind, nor even to have\r\nperfect command of their ears and eyes. To whatever direction the shouts\r\nof the enemy, the cries of women and children, the crackling of the\r\nflames, and the crash of falling houses, had called their attention,\r\nthither, terrified at every incident, they turned their thoughts, faces,\r\nand eyes, as if placed by fortune to be spectators of their falling\r\ncountry, and as if left as protectors of no other of their effects,\r\nexcept their own persons: so much more to be commiserated than any\r\nothers who were ever besieged, because, shut out from their country,\r\nthey were besieged, beholding all their effects in the power of the\r\nenemy. Nor was the night, which succeeded so shockingly spent a day,\r\nmore tranquil; daylight then followed a restless night; nor was there\r\nany time which failed to produce the sight of some new disaster. Loaded\r\nand overwhelmed by so many evils, they did not at all abate their\r\ndetermination, [resolved,] though they should see every thing in flames\r\nand levelled to the dust, to defend by their bravery the hill which they\r\noccupied, small and ill provided as it was, being left [as a refuge] for\r\nliberty. And now, as the same events recurred every day, as if\r\nhabituated to misfortunes, they abstracted their thoughts from all\r\nfeeling of their circumstances, regarding their arms only, and the\r\nswords in their right hands, as the sole remnants of their hopes.\r\n\r\n43. The Gauls also, after having for several days waged an ineffectual\r\nwar against the buildings of the city, when they saw that among the\r\nfires and ruins of the captured city nothing now remained except armed\r\nenemies, neither terrified by so many disasters, nor likely to turn\r\ntheir thoughts to a surrender, unless force were employed, determine to\r\nhave recourse to extremities, and to make an attack on the citadel. A\r\nsignal being given at break of day, their entire multitude is marshalled\r\nin the forum; thence, after raising the shout and forming a testudo,\r\nthey advance to the attack. Against whom the Romans, acting neither\r\nrashly nor precipitately, having strengthened the guards at every\r\napproach, and opposing the main strength of their men in that quarter\r\nwhere they saw the battalions advancing, suffer the enemy to ascend,\r\njudging that the higher they ascended, the more easily would they be\r\ndriven back down the steep. About the middle of the ascent they met\r\nthem: and making a charge thence from the higher ground, which of itself\r\nbore them against the enemy, they routed the Gauls with slaughter and\r\ndestruction, so that never after, either in parties or with their whole\r\nforce, did they try that kind of fighting. Laying aside all hope of\r\nsucceeding by force of arms, they prepare for a blockade; of which\r\nhaving had no idea up to that time, they had, whilst burning the city,\r\ndestroyed whatever corn had been therein, and during those very days all\r\nthe provisions had been carried off from the land to Veii. Accordingly,\r\ndividing their army, they resolved that one part should plunder through\r\nthe neighbouring states, that the other part should carry on the siege\r\nof the citadel, so that the ravagers of the country might supply the\r\nbesiegers with corn.\r\n\r\n44. The Gauls, who marched from the city, were led by fortune herself,\r\nto make trial of Roman valour, to Ardea, where Camillus was in exile:\r\nwho, more distressed by the fortune of the public than his own, whilst\r\nhe now pined away arraigning gods and men, fired with indignation, and\r\nwondering where were now those men who with him had taken Veii and\r\nFalerii, who had conducted other wars rather by their own valour than by\r\nthe favour of fortune, hears on a sudden that the army of the Gauls was\r\napproaching, and that the people of Ardea in consternation were met in\r\ncouncil on the subject. And as if moved by divine inspiration, after he\r\nadvanced into the midst of the assembly, having hitherto been accustomed\r\nto absent himself from such meetings, he says, \"People of Ardea, my\r\nfriends of old, of late my fellow-citizens also, since your kindness so\r\nordered it, and my good fortune achieved it, let no one of you suppose\r\nthat I have come forward here forgetful of my condition; but the\r\n[present] case and the common danger obliges every one to contribute to\r\nthe common good whatever service he can in our present alarming\r\nsituation. And when shall I repay you for your so very important\r\nservices to me, if I now be remiss? or where will you derive benefit\r\nfrom me, if not in war? By this accomplishment I maintained my rank in\r\nmy native country: and, unconquered in war, I was banished during peace\r\nby my ungrateful fellow-citizens. To you, men of Ardea, a favourable\r\nopportunity has been presented of making a return for all the former\r\nfavours conferred by the Roman people, such as you yourselves remember,\r\n(for which reason, as being mindful of them, you are not to be upbraided\r\nwith them,) and of obtaining great military renown for this your city\r\nover the common enemy. The nation, which now approaches in disorderly\r\nmarch, is one to which nature has given great spirits and bodies rather\r\nhuge than firm. Let the disaster of Rome serve as a proof. They captured\r\nthe city when lying open to them; a small handful of men from the\r\ncitadel and Capitol withstand them. Already tired out by the slow\r\nprocess of a siege, they retire and spread themselves through the\r\ncountry. Gorged with food and wine hastily swallowed, when night comes\r\non they stretch themselves indiscriminately, like brutes, near streams\r\nof water, without entrenchment, without guards or advanced posts; more\r\nincautious even now than usual in consequence of success. If you then\r\nare disposed to defend your own walls, and not to suffer all these\r\nplaces to become Gaul, take up arms in a full body at the first watch:\r\nfollow me to slaughter, not to battle. If I do not deliver them up to\r\nyou fettered by sleep, to be butchered like cattle, I decline not the\r\nsame issue of my affairs at Ardea as I had at Rome.\"\r\n\r\n45. Both friends and enemies were satisfied that there existed no where\r\nat that time a man of equal military talent. The assembly being\r\ndismissed, they refresh themselves, carefully watching the moment the\r\nsignal should be given; which being given, during the silence of the\r\nbeginning of the night they attended Camillus at the gates. Having gone\r\nforth to no great distance from the city, they found the camp of the\r\nGauls, as had been foretold, unprotected and neglected on every side,\r\nand attack it with a shout. No fight any where, but slaughter every\r\nwhere; their bodies, naked and relaxed with sleep, are cut to pieces.\r\nThose most remote, however, being roused from their beds, not knowing\r\nwhat the tumult was, or whence it came, were directed to flight, and\r\nsome of them, without perceiving it, into the midst of the enemy. A\r\ngreat number flying into the territory of Antium, an attack being made\r\non them in their straggling march by the townspeople, were surrounded\r\nand cut off. A like carnage was made of the Tuscans in the Veientian\r\nterritory; who were so far from compassionating the city which had now\r\nbeen its neighbour for nearly four hundred years, overpowered as it now\r\nwas by a strange and unheard-of enemy, that at that very time they made\r\nincursions on the Roman territory; and laden with plunder, had it in\r\ncontemplation to lay siege to Veii, the bulwark and last hope of the\r\nRoman race. The Roman soldiers had seen them straggling over the\r\ncountry, and collected in a body, driving the spoil before them, and\r\nthey perceived their camp pitched at no great distance from Veii. Upon\r\nthis, first self-commiseration, then indignation, and after that\r\nresentment, took possession of their minds: \"Were their calamities to be\r\na subject of mockery to the Etrurians, from whom they had turned off the\r\nGallic war on themselves?\" Scarce could they curb their passions, so as\r\nto refrain from attacking them at the moment; and being restrained by\r\nQuintus Cædicius, the centurion, whom they had appointed their\r\ncommander, they deferred the matter until night. A leader equal to\r\nCamillus was all that was wanted; in other respects matters were\r\nconducted in the same order and with the same fortunate result. And\r\nfurther, under the guidance of some prisoners, who had survived the\r\nnightly slaughter, they set out to Salinæ against another body of\r\nTuscans, they suddenly made on the following night still greater havoc,\r\nand returned to Veii exulting in their double victory.\r\n\r\n46. Meanwhile, at Rome, the siege, in general, was slow, and there was\r\nquiet on both sides, the Gauls being intent only on this, that none of\r\nthe enemy should escape from between their posts; when, on a sudden, a\r\nRoman youth drew on himself the admiration both of his countrymen and\r\nthe enemy. There was a sacrifice solemnized at stated times by the\r\nFabian family on the Quirinal hill. To perform this Caius Fabius Dorso\r\nhaving descended from the Capitol, in the Gabine cincture, carrying in\r\nhis hands the sacred utensils, passed out through the midst of the\r\nenemy's post, without being at all moved by the calls or threats of any\r\nof them, and reached the Quirinal hill; and after duly performing there\r\nthe solemn rites, coming back by the same way with the same firm\r\ncountenance and gait, confident that the gods were propitious, whose\r\nworship he had not even neglected when prohibited by the fear of death,\r\nhe returned to the Capitol to his friends, the Gauls being either\r\nastounded at such an extraordinary manifestation of boldness, or moved\r\neven by religious considerations, of which the nation is by no means\r\nregardless. In the mean time, not only the courage, but the strength of\r\nthose at Veii increased daily, not only those Romans repairing thither\r\nfrom the country who had strayed away after the unsuccessful battle, or\r\nthe disaster of the city being taken, but volunteers also flowing in\r\nfrom Latium, to come in for share of the spoil. It now seemed high time\r\nthat their country should be recovered and rescued from the hands of the\r\nenemy. But a head was wanting to this strong body. The very spot put\r\nthem in mind of Camillus, and a considerable part consisted of soldiers\r\nwho had fought successfully under his guidance and auspices: and\r\nCædicius declared that he would not give occasion that any one, whether\r\ngod or man, should terminate his command rather than that, mindful of\r\nhis own rank, he would himself call (for the appointment of) a general.\r\nWith universal consent it was resolved that Camillus should be sent for\r\nfrom Ardea, but not until the senate at Rome were first consulted: so\r\nfar did a sense of propriety regulate every proceeding, and so carefully\r\ndid they observe the distinctions of things in their almost desperate\r\ncircumstances. They had to pass at great risk through the enemy's\r\nguards. For this purpose a spirited youth, Pontius Cominius, offered his\r\nservices, and supporting himself on cork was carried down the Tiber to\r\nthe city. From thence, where the distance from the bank was shortest, he\r\nmakes his way into the Capitol over a portion of the rock that was\r\ncraggy, and therefore neglected by the enemy's guard: and being\r\nconducted to the magistrates, he delivers the instructions received from\r\nthe army. Then having received a decree of the senate, both that\r\nCamillus should be recalled from exile at the comitia curiata, and be\r\nforthwith appointed dictator by order of the people, and that the\r\nsoldiers should have the general whom they wished, he passed out the\r\nsame way and proceeded with his despatches to Veii; and deputies being\r\nsent to Camillus to Ardea, conducted him to Veii: or else the law was\r\npassed by the curiæ, and he was nominated dictator in his absence; for I\r\nam more inclined to believe that he did not set out from Ardea until he\r\nfound that the law was passed; because he could neither change his\r\nresidence without an order of the people, nor hold the privilege of the\r\nauspices in the army until he was nominated dictator.\r\n\r\n47. Whilst these things were going on at Veii, in the mean while the\r\ncitadel and Capitol of Rome were in great danger. For the Gauls either\r\nhaving perceived the track of a human foot where the messenger from Veii\r\nhad passed, or having of themselves remarked the easy ascent by the rock\r\nat the temple of Carmentis, on a moonlight night, after they had at\r\nfirst sent forward an unarmed person, to make trial of the way,\r\ndelivering their arms, whenever any difficulty occurred, alternately\r\nsupported and supporting each other, and drawing each other up,\r\naccording as the ground required, they reached the summit in such\r\nsilence, that they not only escaped the notice of the sentinels, but of\r\nthe dogs also, an animal extremely wakeful with respect to noises by\r\nnight. The notice of the geese they did not escape, which, as being\r\nsacred to Juno, were spared though they were in the greatest scarcity of\r\nfood. Which circumstance was the cause of their preservation. For Marcus\r\nManlius, who three years before had been consul, a man distinguished in\r\nwar, being aroused from sleep by their cackling and the clapping of\r\ntheir wings, snatched up his arms, and at the same time calling the\r\nothers to do the same, proceeds to the spot; and whilst the others are\r\nthrown into confusion, he struck with the boss of his shield and tumbles\r\ndown a Gaul, who had already got footing on the summit; and when the\r\nfall of this man as he tumbled threw down those who were next him, he\r\nslew others, who in their consternation had thrown away their arms, and\r\ncaught hold of the rocks to which they clung. And now the others also\r\nhaving assembled beat down the enemy by javelins and stones, and the\r\nentire band, having lost their footing, were hurled down the precipice\r\nin promiscuous ruin. The alarm then subsiding, the remainder of the\r\nnight was given up to repose, (as far as could be done considering the\r\ndisturbed state of their minds,) when the danger, even though past,\r\nstill kept them in a state of anxiety. Day having appeared, the soldiers\r\nwere summoned by sound of trumpet to attend the tribunes in assembly,\r\nwhen recompence was to be made both to merit and to demerit; Manlius was\r\nfirst of all commended for his bravery and presented with gifts, not\r\nonly by the military tribunes, but with the consent of the soldiers, for\r\nthey all carried to his house, which was in the citadel, a contribution\r\nof half a pound of corn and half a pint of wine: a matter trifling in\r\nthe relation, but the [prevailing] scarcity had rendered it a strong\r\nproof of esteem, when each man, depriving himself of his own food,\r\ncontributed in honour of one man a portion subtracted from his body and\r\nfrom his necessary requirements. Then the guards of that place where the\r\nenemy had climbed up unobserved, were summoned; and when Quintus\r\nSulpicius declared openly that he would punish all according to the\r\nusage of military discipline, being deterred by the consentient shout of\r\nthe soldiers who threw the blame on one sentinel, he spared the rest.\r\nThe man, who was manifestly guilty of the crime, he threw down from the\r\nrock, with the approbation of all. From this time forth the guards on\r\nboth sides became more vigilant; on the part of the Gauls, because a\r\nrumour spread that messengers passed between Veii and Rome, and on that\r\nof the Romans, from the recollection of the danger which occurred during\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\n48. But beyond all the evils of siege and war, famine distressed both\r\narmies; pestilence, moreover, [oppressed] the Gauls, both as being\r\nencamped in a place lying between hills, as well as heated by the\r\nburning of the houses, and full of exhalations, and sending up not only\r\nashes but embers also, whenever the wind rose to any degree; and as the\r\nnation, accustomed to moisture and cold, is most intolerant of these\r\nannoyances, and, suffering severely from the heat and suffocation, they\r\nwere dying, the diseases spreading as among cattle, now becoming weary\r\nof burying separately, they heaped up the bodies promiscuously and\r\nburned them; and rendered the place remarkable by the name of Gallic\r\npiles. A truce was now made with the Romans, and conferences were held\r\nwith the permission of the commanders; in which when the Gauls\r\nfrequently alluded to the famine, and referred to the urgency of that as\r\na further motive for their surrendering, for the purpose of removing\r\nthat opinion, bread is said to have been thrown in many places from the\r\nCapitol, into the advanced posts of the enemy. But the famine could\r\nneither be dissembled nor endured any longer. Accordingly, whilst the\r\ndictator is engaged in person in holding a levy, in ordering his master\r\nof the horse, Lucius Valerius, to bring up the troops from Veii, in\r\nmaking preparations and arrangements, so that he may attack the enemy on\r\nequal terms, in the mean time the army of the Capitol, wearied out with\r\nkeeping guard and with watches, having surmounted all human sufferings,\r\nwhilst nature would not suffer famine alone to be overcome, looking\r\nforward from day to day, to see whether any succour would come from the\r\ndictator, at length not only food but hope also failing, and their arms\r\nweighing down their debilitated bodies, whilst the guards were being\r\nrelieved, insisted that there should be either a surrender, or that they\r\nshould be bought off, on whatever terms were possible, the Gauls\r\nintimating in rather plain terms, that they could be induced for no very\r\ngreat compensation to relinquish the siege. Then the senate was held and\r\ninstructions were given to the military tribunes to capitulate. Upon\r\nthis the matter was settled between Quintus Sulpicius, a military\r\ntribune, and Brennus, the chieftain of the Gauls, and one thousand\r\npounds' weight of gold was agreed on as the ransom of a people, who were\r\nsoon after to be the rulers of the world. To a transaction very\r\nhumiliating in itself, insult was added. False weights were brought by\r\nthe Gauls, and on the tribune objecting, his sword was thrown in in\r\naddition to the weight by the insolent Gaul, and an expression was heard\r\nintolerable to the Romans, \"Woe to the vanquished!\"\r\n\r\n49. But both gods and men interfered to prevent the Romans from living\r\non the condition of being ransomed; for by some chance, before the\r\nexecrable price was completed, all the gold being not yet weighed in\r\nconsequence of the altercation, the dictator comes up, and orders the\r\ngold to be removed, and the Gauls to clear away. When they, holding out\r\nagainst him, affirmed that they had concluded a bargain, he denied that\r\nthe agreement was a valid one, which had been entered into with a\r\nmagistrate of inferior authority without his orders, after he had been\r\nnominated dictator; and he gives notice to the Gauls to get ready for\r\nbattle. He orders his men to throw their baggage in a heap, and to get\r\nready their arms, and to recover their country with steel, not with\r\ngold, having before their eyes the temples of the gods, and their wives\r\nand children, and the soil of their country disfigured by the calamities\r\nof war, and all those objects which they were solemnly bound to defend,\r\nto recover, and to revenge. He then draws up his army, as the nature of\r\nthe place admitted, on the site of the half-demolished city, and which\r\nwas uneven by nature, and he secured all those advantages for his own\r\nmen, which could be prepared or selected by military skill. The Gauls,\r\nthrown into confusion by the unexpected event, take up arms, and with\r\nrage, rather than good judgment, rushed upon the Romans. Fortune had now\r\nchanged; now the aid of the gods and human prudence assisted the Roman\r\ncause. At the first encounter, therefore, the Gauls were routed with no\r\ngreater difficulty than they had found in gaining the victory at Allia.\r\nThey were afterwards beaten under the conduct and auspices of the same\r\nCamillus, in a more regular engagement, at the eighth stone on the\r\nGabine road, whither they had betaken themselves after their defeat.\r\nThere the slaughter was universal: their camp was taken, and not even\r\none person was left to carry news of the defeat. The dictator, after\r\nhaving recovered his country from the enemy, returns into the city in\r\ntriumph; and among the rough military jests which they throw out [on\r\nsuch occasions] he is styled, with praises by no means undeserved,\r\nRomulus, and parent of his country, and a second founder of the city.\r\nHis country, thus preserved by arms, he unquestionably saved a second\r\ntime in peace, when he hindered the people from removing to Veii, both\r\nthe tribunes pressing the matter with greater earnestness after the\r\nburning of the city, and the commons of themselves being more inclined\r\nto that measure; and that was the cause of his not resigning his\r\ndictatorship after the triumph, the senate entreating him not to leave\r\nthe commonwealth in so unsettled a state.\r\n\r\n50. First of all, he proposed matters appertaining to the immortal gods;\r\nfor he was a most scrupulous observer of religious duties; and he\r\nprocures a decree of the senate, \"that all the temples, as the enemy had\r\npossessed them, should be restored, their bounds traced, and expiations\r\nmade for them, and that the form of expiation should be sought in the\r\nbooks by the decemvirs; that a league of hospitality should be entered\r\ninto by public authority with the people of Cære, because they had\r\nafforded a reception to the sacred utensils of the Roman people and to\r\ntheir priests; and because, by the kindness of that people, the worship\r\nof the immortal gods had not been intermitted; that Capitoline games\r\nshould be exhibited, for that Jupiter, supremely good and great, had\r\nprotected his own mansion and the citadel of the Roman people when in\r\ndanger; and that Marcus Furius, the dictator, should establish a college\r\nfor that purpose, out of those who should inhabit the Capitol and\r\ncitadel.\" Mention was also introduced of expiating the voice heard by\r\nnight, which had been heard announcing the calamity before the Gallic\r\nwar, and neglected, and a temple was ordered in the New Street to Aius\r\nLocutius. The gold, which had been rescued from the Gauls, and that also\r\nwhich during the alarm had been collected from the other temples into\r\nthe recess of Jupiter's temple, the recollection being confused as to\r\nthe temples to which it should be carried back, was all judged to be\r\nsacred, and ordered to be placed under the throne of Jupiter. Already\r\nthe religious scruples of the state had appeared in this, that when gold\r\nwas wanting for public uses, to make up for the Gauls the amount of the\r\nransom agreed upon, they had accepted that which was contributed by the\r\nmatrons, so that they might not touch the sacred gold. Thanks were\r\nreturned to the matrons, and to this was added the honour of their\r\nhaving funeral orations pronounced on them after death, in the same\r\nmanner as the men. Those things being finished which appertained to the\r\ngods, and such measures as could be transacted through the senate, then,\r\nat length, as the tribunes were teasing the commons by their unceasing\r\nharangues, to leave the ruins, to remove to Veii, a city ready prepared\r\nfor them, being escorted by the entire senate, he ascends the tribunal,\r\nand spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n51. \"Romans, so disagreeable to me are contentions with the tribunes of\r\nthe people, that in my most melancholy exile, whilst I resided at Ardea,\r\nI had no other consolation than that I was removed from these contests;\r\nand for this same reason I would never have returned, even though you\r\nrecalled me by a decree of the senate, and by order of the people. Nor\r\nhas it been any change in my own sentiments, but in your fortune, that\r\nhas persuaded me to return now. For the question was that my country\r\nshould remain in its own established seat, not that I should reside in\r\nmy country. And on the present occasion I would gladly remain quiet and\r\nsilent, were not the present struggle also appertaining to my country's\r\ninterests, to be wanting to which, as long as life lasts, were base in\r\nothers, in Camillus impious. For why have we recovered it? Why have we\r\nrescued it when besieged out of the hands of the enemy, if we ourselves\r\ndesert it when recovered? And when, the Gauls being victorious, the\r\nentire city captured, both the gods and the natives of Rome still\r\nretained and inhabited the Capitol and citadel, shall even the citadel\r\nand the Capitol be deserted, now when the Romans are victorious and the\r\ncity has been recovered? And shall our prosperous fortune cause more\r\ndesolation to this city than our adverse caused? Truly if we had no\r\nreligious institutions established together with the city, and regularly\r\ntransmitted down to us, still the divine power has so manifestly\r\ninterested itself in behalf of the Roman state on the present trying\r\noccasion, that I should think that all neglect of the divine worship was\r\nremoved from the minds of men. For consider the events of these latter\r\nyears one after the other, whether prosperous or adverse; you will find\r\nthat all things succeeded favourably with us whilst we followed the\r\ngods, and unfavourably when we neglected them. Now, first of all the\r\nVeientian war--of how many years' duration, with what immense labour\r\nwaged!--was not brought to a termination, until the water was discharged\r\nfrom the Alban lake by the admonition of the gods. What, in the name of\r\nheaven, regarding this recent calamity of our city? did it arise, until\r\nthe voice sent from heaven concerning the approach of the Gauls was\r\ntreated with slight? until the law of nations was violated by our\r\nambassadors, and until such violation was passed over by us with the\r\nsame indifference towards the gods, when it should have been punished by\r\nus? Accordingly vanquished, made captives and ransomed, we have suffered\r\nsuch punishments at the hands of gods and men, as that we are now a\r\nwarning to the whole world. Afterwards our misfortunes reminded us of\r\nour religious duties. We fled for refuge to the gods, to the seat of\r\nJupiter supremely good and great; amid the ruin of all our effects our\r\nsacred utensils we partly concealed in the earth; part of them we\r\ncarried away to the neighbouring cities and removed from the eyes of the\r\nenemy. Though deserted by gods and men, still we intermitted not the\r\nworship of the gods. Accordingly they have restored to us our country,\r\nand victory, our ancient renown in war which had been lost, and on our\r\nenemies, who, blinded by avarice, have violated the faith of a treaty\r\nwith respect to the weight of gold, they have turned dismay, and flight,\r\nand slaughter.\r\n\r\n52. \"When you behold such striking instances of the effects of honouring\r\nor neglecting the deity, do you perceive what an act of impiety we are\r\nabout to perpetrate, scarcely emerging from the wreck of our former\r\nmisconduct and calamity? We possess a city founded under auspices and\r\nauguries; not a spot is there in it that is not full of religious rites\r\nand of the gods: the days for the anniversary sacrifices are not more\r\ndefinitely stated, than are the places in which they are to be\r\nperformed. All these gods, both public and private, do ye, Romans,\r\npretend to forsake. What similarity does your conduct bear [to that]\r\nwhich lately during the siege was beheld with no less admiration by the\r\nenemy than by yourselves in that excellent Caius Fabius, when he\r\ndescended from the citadel amid the Gallic weapons, and performed on the\r\nQuirinal hill the solemn rites of the Fabian family? Is it your wish\r\nthat the family religious rites should not be intermitted even during\r\nwar, but that the public rites and the Roman gods should be deserted\r\neven in time of peace, and that the pontiffs and flamens should be more\r\nnegligent of public religious ceremonies, than a private individual in\r\nthe anniversary rite of a particular family? Perhaps some one may say,\r\nthat we will either perform these duties at Veii, or that we will send\r\nour priests hither from thence in order to perform them; neither of\r\nwhich can be done, without infringing on the established forms. For not\r\nto enumerate all the sacred rites severally and all the gods, whether in\r\nthe banquet of Jupiter can the lectisternium be performed in any other\r\nplace, save in the Capitol? What shall I say of the eternal fire of\r\nVesta, and of the statue, which, as the pledge of empire, is kept under\r\nthe safeguard of her temple? What, O Mars Gradivus, and you, father\r\nQuirinus, of your Ancilia? Is it right that these sacred things, coeval\r\nwith the city, some of them more ancient than the origin of the city,\r\nshould be abandoned to profanation? And, observe the difference existing\r\nbetween us and our ancestors. They handed down to us certain sacred\r\nrites to be performed by us on the Alban and on the Lavinian mounts. Was\r\nit in conformity with religion that these sacred rites were transferred\r\nto us to Rome from the cities of our enemies? shall we transfer them\r\nhence to Veii, an enemy's city, without impiety? Come, recollect how\r\noften sacred rites are performed anew, because some ceremony of our\r\ncountry had been omitted through negligence or accident. On a late\r\noccasion, what circumstance, after the prodigy of the Alban lake, proved\r\na remedy to the state distressed by the Veientian war, but the\r\nrepetition of the sacred rites and the renewal of the auspices? But\r\nfurther, as if duly mindful of ancient religious usages, we have both\r\ntransferred foreign deities to Rome, and have established new ones. Very\r\nrecently, imperial Juno was transferred from Veii, and had her\r\ndedication performed on a day how distinguished for the extraordinary\r\nzeal of the matrons, and with what a full attendance! We have directed a\r\ntemple to be erected to Aius Locutius, in consequence of the heavenly\r\nvoice heard in the New Street. To our other solemnities we have added\r\nthe Capitoline games, and, by direction of the senate, we have founded a\r\nnew college for that purpose. Which of these things need we have done,\r\nif we were to leave the Roman city together with the Gauls? if it was\r\nnot voluntarily we remained in the Capitol for so many months of siege;\r\nif we were retained by the enemy through motives of fear? We are\r\nspeaking of the sacred rites and of the temples; what, pray, of the\r\npriests? Does it not occur to you, what a degree of profaneness would be\r\ncommitted in respect of them. The Vestals, forsooth, have but that one\r\nsettlement, from which nothing ever disturbed them, except the capture\r\nof the city. It is an act of impiety for the flamen Dialis to remain for\r\na single night without the city. Do ye mean to make them Veientian\r\ninstead of Roman priests? And shall the virgins forsake thee, O Vesta?\r\nAnd shall the flamen by living abroad draw on himself and on his country\r\nsuch a weight of guilt every night? What of the other things, all of\r\nwhich we transact under auspices within the Pomærium, to what oblivion,\r\nto what neglect do we consign them? The assemblies of the Curias, which\r\ncomprise military affairs; the assemblies of the Centuries, at which you\r\nelect consuls and military tribunes, when can they be held under\r\nauspices, unless where they are wont [to be held]? Shall we transfer\r\nthem to Veii? or whether for the purpose of holding their elections\r\nshall the people assemble at so great inconvenience into a city deserted\r\nby gods and men?\r\n\r\n53. \"But the case itself forces us to leave a city desolated by fire and\r\nruin, and remove to Veii, where all things are entire, and not to\r\ndistress the needy commons by building here. But that this is only held\r\nout as a pretext, rather than that it is the real motive, I think is\r\nevident to you, though I should say nothing on the subject; for you\r\nremember that before the arrival of the Gauls, when the buildings, both\r\npublic and private, were still unhurt, and the city still stood in\r\nsafety, this same question was agitated, that we should remove to Veii.\r\nObserve then, tribunes, what a difference there is between my way of\r\nthinking and yours. Ye think that though it may not have been advisable\r\nto do it then, still that now it ought certainly to be done; I, on the\r\ncontrary, (and be not surprised until you shall have heard the state of\r\nthe case,) admitting it were advisable to remove when the entire city\r\nwas safe, would not vote for relinquishing these ruins now. For then\r\nvictory would be the cause of our removing into a captured city, one\r\nthat would be glorious to ourselves and our posterity; whilst now this\r\nsame removal would be wretched and disgraceful to us, and glorious to\r\nthe Gauls. For we shall appear not to have left our country as\r\nconquerors, but to have lost it from having been vanquished; the flight\r\nat Allia, the capture of the city, the blockading of the Capitol, [will\r\nseem] to have imposed this necessity on us of forsaking our household\r\ngods, of having recourse to exile and flight from that place which we\r\nwere unable to defend. And have the Gauls been able to demolish Rome,\r\nwhich the Romans shall be deemed to have been unable to restore? What\r\nremains, but that if they should now come with new forces, (for it is\r\nevident that their number is scarcely credible,) and should they feel\r\ndisposed to dwell in this city, captured by them, and deserted by you,\r\nwould you suffer them? What, if not the Gauls, but your old enemies, the\r\nÆquans and Volscians, should form the design of removing to Rome; would\r\nyou be willing that they should become Romans, you Veientians? Would ye\r\nprefer that this should be a desert in your possession, or a city of the\r\nenemy? For my part I can see nothing more impious. Is it because ye are\r\naverse to building, ye are prepared to incur this guilt, this disgrace?\r\nEven though no better, no more ample structure could be erected\r\nthroughout the entire city than that cottage of our founder, is it not\r\nbetter to dwell in cottages, like shepherds and rustics, amid your\r\nsacred places and your household gods, than to go publicly into exile?\r\nOur forefathers, strangers and shepherds, when there was nothing in\r\nthese places but woods and marshes, erected a new city in a very short\r\ntime; do we, with a Capitol and citadel safe, and the temples of the\r\ngods still standing, feel it irksome to build up what has been burnt?\r\nand what we individually would have done, if our private residence had\r\nbeen burned down, shall we as a body refuse to do in the case of a\r\npublic conflagration?\r\n\r\n54. \"What, if by some evil design of accident a fire should break out at\r\nVeii, and the flames spread by the wind, as may happen, should consume a\r\nconsiderable portion of the city; are we then to seek Fidenæ, or Gabii,\r\nor any other city to remove to? Has our native soil so slight a hold on\r\nus, or this earth which we call mother; or does our love of country lie\r\nmerely in the surface and in the timber of the houses? For my part, I\r\nwill acknowledge to you, whilst I was absent, though I am less disposed\r\nto remember this as the effect of your injustice than of my own\r\nmisfortune, as often as my country came into my mind, all these\r\ncircumstances occurred to me, the hills, the plains, the Tiber, the face\r\nof the country familiar to my eyes, and this sky, beneath which I had\r\nbeen born and educated; may these now induce you, by their endearing\r\nhold on you, to remain in your present settlement, rather than they\r\nshould cause you to pine away through regret, after having left them.\r\nNot without good reason did gods and men select this place for founding\r\na city: these most healthful hills; a commodious river, by means of\r\nwhich the produce of the soil may be conveyed from the inland countries,\r\nby which maritime supplies may be obtained; close enough to the sea for\r\nall purposes of convenience, and not exposed by too much proximity to\r\nthe dangers of foreign fleets; a situation in the centre of the regions\r\nof Italy, singularly adapted by nature for the increase of a city. The\r\nvery size of so new a city is a proof. Romans, the present year is the\r\nthree hundred and sixty-fifth year of the city; for so long a time are\r\nyou waging war amid nations of such long standing; yet not to mention\r\nsingle cities, neither the Volscians combined with the Æquans, so many\r\nand such strong towns, nor all Etruria, so potent by land and sea,\r\noccupying the breadth of Italy between the two seas, can cope with you\r\nin war. And as the case is so, where, in the name of goodness, is the\r\nwisdom in you who have tried [this situation] to make trial now of some\r\nother, when, though your own valour may be removed elsewhere, the\r\nfortune of this place certainly cannot be transferred? Here is the\r\nCapitol, where, a human head being found, it was foretold that in that\r\nplace would be the head of the world, and the chief seat of empire.\r\nHere, when the Capitol was to be freed by the rites of augury, Juventas\r\nand Terminus, to the very great joy of our fathers, suffered not\r\nthemselves to be moved. Here is the fire of Vesta, here the Ancilia sent\r\ndown from heaven, here are all the gods propitious to you if you stay.\"\r\n\r\n55. Camillus is said to have moved them as well by other parts of his\r\nspeech, but chiefly by that which related to religious matters. But an\r\nexpression seasonably uttered determined the matter whilst still\r\nundecided; for when a meeting of the senate, a little after this, was\r\nbeing held in the Curia Hostilia regarding these questions, and some\r\ntroops returning from relieving guard passed through the forum in their\r\nmarch, a centurion in the comitium cried out, \"Standard-bearer, fix your\r\nstandard! it is best for us to remain here.\" Which expression being\r\nheard, both the senate came out from the senate-house, and all cried out\r\nthat \"they embraced the omen,\" and the commons, who were collected\r\naround, joined their approbation. The law [under discussion] being\r\nrejected, the building of the city commenced in several parts at once.\r\nTiles were supplied at the public expense. The privilege of hewing stone\r\nand felling timber wherever each person wished was granted, security\r\nbeing taken that they would finish the buildings on that year. Their\r\nhaste took away all attention to the regulating the course of the\r\nstreets, whilst, setting aside all distinction of property, they build\r\non any part that was vacant. That is the reason why the ancient sewers,\r\nat first conducted through the public streets, now in many places pass\r\nunder private houses, and why the form of the city appears more like one\r\ntaken up by individuals, than regularly portioned out [by\r\ncommissioners].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Successful operations against the Volscians, and Æquans, and\r\n     Prænestines. Four tribes were added. Marcus Manlius, who had\r\n     defended the Capitol from the Gauls, being condemned for aspiring\r\n     to regal power, is thrown from the Tarpeian rock; in commemoration\r\n     of which circumstance a decree of the senate was passed, that none\r\n     of the Manlian family should henceforward bear the cognomen of\r\n     Marcus. Caius Licinius and Lucius Sextius, tribunes of the people,\r\n     proposed a law that consuls might be chosen from among the commons;\r\n     and after a violent contest, succeeded in passing that law,\r\n     notwithstanding the opposition of the patricians, the same tribunes\r\n     of the commons being for five years the only magistrates in the\r\n     state; and Lucius Sextius was the first consul elected from the\r\n     commons._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The transactions of the Romans, from the building of the city of Rome\r\nto the capture of the same city, first under kings, then under consuls,\r\nand dictators, and decemvirs, and consular tribunes, their wars abroad,\r\ntheir dissensions at home, I have exhibited in five books: matters\r\nobscure, as well by reason of their very great antiquity, like objects\r\nwhich from their great distance are scarcely perceptible, as also\r\nbecause in those times the use of letters, the only faithful guardian of\r\nthe memory of events, was inconsiderable and rare: and, moreover,\r\nwhatever was contained in the commentaries of the pontiffs, and other\r\npublic and private records, were lost for the most part in the burning\r\nof the city. Henceforwards, from the second origin of the city, which\r\nsprung up again more healthfully and vigorously, as if from its root,\r\nits achievements at home and abroad, shall be narrated with more\r\nclearness and authenticity. But it now stood erect, leaning chiefly on\r\nthe same support, Marcus Furius, by which it had been first raised; nor\r\ndid they suffer him to lay down the dictatorship until the end of the\r\nyear. It was not agreeable to them, that the tribunes during whose time\r\nof office the city had been taken, should preside at the elections for\r\nthe following year: the administration came to an interregnum. Whilst\r\nthe state was kept occupied in the employment and constant labour of\r\nrepairing the city, in the mean time a day of trial was named by Caius\r\nMarcius, tribune of the people, for Quintus Fabius, as soon as he went\r\nout of office, because whilst an ambassador he had, contrary to the law\r\nof nations, appeared in arms against the Gauls, to whom he had been sent\r\nas a negotiator; from which trial death removed him so opportunely that\r\nmost people thought it voluntary. The interregnum commenced. Publius\r\nCornelius Scipio was interrex, and after him Marcus Furius Camillus. He\r\nnominates as military tribunes with consular power, Lucius Valerius\r\nPublicola a second time, Lucius Virginius, Publius Cornelius, Aulus\r\nManlius, Lucius Æmilius, Lucius Postumius. These having entered on their\r\noffice immediately after the interregnum, consulted the senate on no\r\nother business previous to that which related to religion. In the first\r\nplace they ordered that the treaties and laws which could be found,\r\nshould be collected; (these consisted of the twelve tables, and some\r\nlaws made under the kings.) Some of them were publicly promulgated; but\r\nsuch as appertained to religious matters were kept secret chiefly by the\r\npontiffs, that they might hold the minds of the people fettered by them.\r\nThen they began to turn their attention to the subject of desecrated\r\ndays; and the day before the fifteenth day of the calends of August,\r\nremarkable for a double disaster, (as being the day on which the Fabii\r\nwere slain at Cremera, and afterwards the disgraceful battle attended\r\nwith the ruin of the city had been fought at Allia,) they called the\r\nAllian day from the latter disaster, and they rendered it remarkable for\r\ntransacting no business whether public or private. Some persons think,\r\nthat because Sulpicius, the military tribune, had not duly offered\r\nsacrifice on the day after the ides of July, and because, without having\r\nobtained the favour of the gods, the Roman army had been exposed to the\r\nenemy on the third day after, an order was also made to abstain from all\r\nreligious undertakings on the day following the ides: thence the same\r\nreligious observance was derived with respect to the days following the\r\ncalends and the nones.\r\n\r\n2. But it was not long allowed them to consult in quiet regarding the\r\nmeans of raising the city, after so grievous a fall. On the one side\r\ntheir old enemies, the Volscians, had taken arms, to extinguish the\r\nRoman name: on the other, some traders brought [intelligence] that a\r\nconspiracy of the leading men of Etruria from all the states had been\r\nformed at the temple of Voltumna. A new cause of terror also had been\r\nadded by the defection of the Latins and Hernicians, who, since the\r\nbattle fought at the lake Regillus, had remained in friendship with the\r\nRoman people with fidelity not to be questioned. Accordingly, when such\r\ngreat alarms surrounded them on every side, and it became apparent to\r\nall that the Roman name laboured not only under hatred with their\r\nenemies, but under contempt also with their allies; it was resolved that\r\nthe state should be defended under the same auspices, as those under\r\nwhich it had been recovered, and that Marcus Furius should be nominated\r\ndictator. He, when dictator, nominated Caius Servilius Ahala master of\r\nthe horse; and a suspension of all public business being proclaimed, he\r\nheld a levy of the juniors, in such a manner as to divide them into\r\ncenturies after they had sworn allegiance to him. The army, when raised\r\nand equipped with arms, he divided into three parts. One part he opposed\r\nto Etruria in the Veientian territory; another he ordered to pitch their\r\ncamp before the city. A military tribune, Aulus Manlius, commanded the\r\nlatter; those who were sent against the Etrurians, Lucius Æmilius\r\ncommanded. The third part he led in person against the Volscians; and\r\nnot far from Lanuvium, (the place is called ad Mæcium,) he set about\r\nstorming their camp. Into these, who set out to the war from motives of\r\ncontempt, because they thought that all the Roman youth were cut off by\r\nthe Gauls, the fact of having heard that Camillus was appointed to the\r\ncommand struck such terror, that they fenced themselves with a rampart,\r\nand the rampart itself with trees piled up together, lest the enemy\r\nmight by any means reach to the works. When Camillus observed this, he\r\nordered fire to be thrown into the fence opposed to him; and it so\r\nhappened that a very strong wind was turned towards the enemy. He\r\ntherefore not only opened a passage by the fire, but the flames being\r\ndirected against the camp, by the vapour also and the smoke, and by the\r\ncrackling of the green timber as it burned, he so confounded the enemy\r\nthat the Romans had less difficulty in passing the rampart into the\r\ncamp of the Volscians, than they had experienced in climbing over the\r\nfence which had been consumed by the fire. The enemy being routed and\r\ncut down, after the dictator had taken the camp by assault, he gave up\r\nthe booty to the soldiers, which was so much the more agreeable, as it\r\nwas less expected, the commander being by no means profusely generous.\r\nThen having pursued them in their flight, after he had depopulated the\r\nentire Volscian land, he at length in the seventieth year forced the\r\nVolscians to a surrender. After his victory he passed from the Volscians\r\nto the Æquans, who were also preparing for hostilities: he surprised\r\ntheir army at Bolæ, and having attacked not only their camp, but their\r\ncity also, he took them at the first onset.\r\n\r\n3. When such fortune manifested itself on that side where Camillus, the\r\nlife and soul of the Roman interest, was, a great alarm had fallen on\r\nanother quarter. For almost all Etruria, taking up arms, were besieging\r\nSutrium, allies of the Roman people, whose ambassadors having applied to\r\nthe senate, imploring aid in their distress, obtained a decree, that the\r\ndictator should at the earliest opportunity bear aid to the Sutrians.\r\nAnd when the circumstances of the besieged would not suffer them to\r\nbrook the delay of this hope, and the small number of the townsmen were\r\nspent with labour, watching, and wounds, all which fell heavily on the\r\nsame individuals, and when, the city being delivered up to the enemy by\r\na capitulation, they were leaving their habitations in a miserable\r\ntrain, being discharged without their arms with only a single garment;\r\nat that juncture Camillus happened to come up at the head of the Roman\r\narmy. And when the mournful crowd prostrated themselves at his feet, and\r\nthe address of the leading men, wrung from them by extreme necessity,\r\nwas followed by the weeping of women and boys, who were dragged along by\r\nthe companions of their exile, he bade the Sutrians to give over their\r\nlamentations: that he brought with him grief and tears to the Etrurians.\r\nHe then orders the baggage to be deposited, and the Sutrians to remain\r\nthere with a small guard left with them, and the soldiers to follow him\r\nin arms. Having thus proceeded to Sutrium with his army disencumbered,\r\nhe found, as he expected, every thing in disorder, as usually happens in\r\nsuccess; no advanced guard before the walls, the gates lying open, and\r\nthe conquerors dispersed, carrying out the booty from the houses of the\r\nenemy. Sutrium is therefore taken a second time on the same day; the\r\nEtrurians, lately victorious, are cut down in every quarter by their new\r\nenemy, nor is time afforded them to collect and form one body, or even\r\nto take up arms. When each pushed eagerly towards the gates, to try if\r\nby any chance they could throw themselves into the fields, they found\r\nthe gates shut; for the dictator had given those orders in the first\r\ninstance. Upon this some took up arms, others, who happened to be armed\r\nbefore the tumult came on them, called their friends together in order\r\nto make battle; which would have been kindled by the despair of the\r\nenemy, had not criers, sent in every direction through the city, issued\r\norders that their arms should be laid down, that the unarmed should be\r\nspared, and that no one should be injured except those who were armed.\r\nThen even those whose minds had been, in their last hope, obstinately\r\nbent on fighting, when hopes of life were offered, threw down their arms\r\nin every direction, and surrendered themselves unarmed to the enemy,\r\nwhich fortune had rendered the safer method. Their number being\r\nconsiderable, they were distributed among several guards; the town was\r\nbefore night restored to the Sutrians uninjured and free from all the\r\ncalamities of war, because it had not been taken by force but delivered\r\nup on terms.\r\n\r\n4. Camillus returned to the city in triumph, being victorious in three\r\nwars at the same time. By far the greatest number of the prisoners whom\r\nhe led before his chariot were from among the Etrurians. And these being\r\nsold by auction, such a sum of money was raised, that after paying the\r\nmatrons the price of their gold, out of that which was over and above,\r\nthree golden bowls were made; which, inscribed with the name of\r\nCamillus, it is certain, lay, before the burning of the Capitol, in the\r\nrecess of Jupiter's temple at the feet of Juno. On that year such of the\r\nVeientians, Capenatians, and Faliscians as had come over to the Romans\r\nduring the wars with those nations, were admitted into the state, and\r\nland was assigned to these new citizens. Those also were recalled by a\r\ndecree of the senate from Veii, who, from a dislike to building at Rome,\r\nhad betaken themselves to Veii, and had seized on the vacant houses\r\nthere. And at first there was a murmuring on their part disregarding the\r\norder; then a day having been appointed, and capital punishment\r\n[denounced against any one] who did not return to Rome, from being\r\nrefractory as they were collectively, rendered them when taken singly\r\nobedient, each through fear for himself. And Rome both now increased in\r\nnumbers, and rose throughout its entire extent by its buildings, the\r\nstate assisting in the expenses, and the ædiles urging on the work as if\r\npublic, and private persons (for the want felt of accommodation\r\nstimulated them) hastening to complete the work; and within a year a new\r\ncity was erected. At the termination of the year an election was held of\r\nmilitary tribunes with consular power. Those elected were, Titus\r\nQuinctius Cincinnatus, Quintus Servilius Fidenas a fifth time, Lucius\r\nJulius Iulus, Lucius Aquillius Corvus, Lucius Lucretius Tricipitinus,\r\nServius Sulpicius Rufus. They led one army against the Æquans, not to\r\nwar, (for they owned themselves conquered,) but from motives of\r\nanimosity, to lay waste their territories, lest they should leave them\r\nany strength for new designs; the other into the territory of Tarquinii.\r\nHere Cortuosa and Contenebra, towns belonging to the Etrurians, were\r\ntaken by storm and demolished. At Cortuosa there was no contest; having\r\nattacked it by surprise, they took it at the first shout and onset; the\r\ntown was plundered and burned. Contenebra sustained a siege for a few\r\ndays; and it was continual labour, abated neither by night nor by day,\r\nthat reduced them. When the Roman army, having been divided into six\r\nparts, each [division] relieved the other in the battle one hour in six\r\nin rotation, and the paucity of numbers exposed the same individual\r\ntownsmen, wearied as they were, to a contest ever new, they at length\r\nyielded, and an opportunity was afforded to the Romans of entering the\r\ncity. It was the wish of the tribunes that the spoil should be made\r\npublic property; but the order [that such should be so] was too late for\r\ntheir determination. Whilst they hesitate, the spoil already became the\r\nproperty of the soldiers; nor could it be taken from them, except by\r\nmeans calculated to excite dissatisfaction. On the same year, that the\r\ncity should not increase by private buildings only, the lower parts of\r\nthe Capitol also were built of hewn stone; a work deserving of\r\nadmiration even amid the present magnificence of the city.\r\n\r\n5. Now, whilst the state was busily occupied in building, the tribunes\r\nof the commons endeavoured to draw crowds to their harangues by\r\n[proposing] the agrarian laws. The Pomptine territory was then, for the\r\nfirst time since the power of the Volscians had been reduced by\r\nCamillus, held out to them as their indisputable right. They alleged it\r\nas a charge, that \"that district was much more harassed on the part of\r\nthe nobility than it had been on that of the Volscians, for that\r\nincursions were made by the one party on it, only as long as they had\r\nstrength and arms; that persons belonging to the nobility encroached on\r\nthe possession of land that was public, nor would there be any room in\r\nit for the commons, unless a division were now made, before they seized\r\non all.\" They made not much impression on the commons, who through their\r\nanxiety for building attended the forum only in small numbers, and were\r\ndrained by their expenses on the same object, and were therefore\r\ncareless about land for the improvement of which means were wanting. The\r\nstate being full of religious impressions, and then even the leading men\r\nhaving become superstitious by reason of their recent misfortunes, in\r\norder that the auspices might be taken anew, the government had once\r\nmore recourse to an interregnum. The successive interreges were, Marcus\r\nManlius Capitolinus, Servius Sulpicius Camerinus, and Lucius Valerius\r\nPotitus. The last at length held an election of military tribunes with\r\nconsular power. He nominates Lucius Papirius, Caius Cornelius, Caius\r\nSergius, Lucius Æmilius a second time, Lucius Menenius, and Lucius\r\nValerius Publicola a third time. These entered on their office after the\r\ninterregnum. This year the temple of Mars, vowed in the Gallic war, was\r\ndedicated by Titus Quinctius, duumvir for performing religious rites.\r\nFour tribes were added from the new citizens, the Stellatine, the\r\nTormentine, the Sabatine, and the Arnian, and they made up the number of\r\ntwenty-five tribes.\r\n\r\n6. Regarding the Pomptine land the matter was pressed by Lucius\r\nSicinius, plebeian tribune, on the people, who now attended in greater\r\nnumbers, and more readily aroused to the desire of land than they had\r\nbeen. And mention having been introduced in the senate regarding war\r\nagainst the Latins and Hernicians, the matter was deferred in\r\nconsequence of their attending to a more important war, because Etruria\r\nwas up in arms. Matters reverted to their electing Camillus military\r\ntribune with consular power. Five colleagues were added, Servius\r\nCornelius Maluginensis, Quintus Servilius Fidenas a sixth time, Lucius\r\nQuinctius Cincinnatus, Lucius Horatius Pulvillus, and Publius Valerius.\r\nAt the commencement of the year the attention of the people was drawn\r\naway from the Etrurian war, because a body of fugitives from the\r\nPomptine district, suddenly entering the city, brought word that the\r\nAntians were up in arms; and that the states of the Latins privately\r\nsent their youth to that war, denying that there was any public concert\r\nin it, they alleging that volunteers were only not prevented from\r\nserving in whatever quarter they pleased. They had now ceased to despise\r\nany wars. Accordingly the senate returned thanks to the gods, because\r\nCamillus was in office; for (they knew) that it would have been\r\nnecessary to nominate him dictator, if he were in a private station. And\r\nhis colleagues agreed that when any terror with respect to war\r\nthreatened, the supreme direction of every thing should be vested in one\r\nman, and that they had determined to consign their authority into the\r\nhands of Camillus; and that they did not consider, that any concession\r\nthey should make to the dignity of that man, derogated in any way from\r\ntheir own. The tribunes having been highly commended by the senate,\r\nCamillus himself also, covered with confusion, returned thanks. He then\r\nsaid that \"a heavy burden was laid on him by the Roman people, by their\r\nhaving now nominated him dictator for the fourth time; a great one by\r\nthe senate, by reason of such flattering judgments of that house\r\nconcerning him; the greatest of all, however, by the condescension of\r\nsuch distinguished colleagues. Where if any addition could be made to\r\nhis diligence and vigilance, that, vying with himself, he would strive\r\nto render the opinion of the state, [expressed] with such unanimity\r\nregarding him, as permanent as it was most honourable.\" In reference to\r\nthe war and to the people of Antium, that there was more of threats\r\nthere than of danger; that he, however, would advise that, as they\r\nshould fear nothing, so should they despise nothing. That the city of\r\nRome was beset by the ill-will and hatred of its neighbours: therefore\r\nthat the commonwealth should be maintained by a plurality, both of\r\ngenerals and of armies. \"It is my wish,\" said he, \"that you, Publius\r\nValerius, as my associate in command and counsel, should lead the troops\r\nwith me against the enemy at Antium; that you, Quintus Servilius, after\r\nraising and equipping another army, shall encamp in the city, ready to\r\nact, whether Etruria, as lately, or these new causes of anxiety, the\r\nLatins and Hernicians, should bestir themselves. I deem it as certain\r\nthat you will conduct matters, as is worthy of your father and\r\ngrandfather, and of yourself and six tribuneships. Let a third army be\r\nraised by Lucius Quinctius, out of those excused from service and the\r\nseniors, [those past the military age,] who may protect the city and the\r\nwalls. Let Lucius Horatius provide arms, weapons, corn, and whatever the\r\nother exigencies of the war shall demand. You, Servius Cornelius, we\r\nyour colleagues appoint the president of this council of the state, the\r\nguardian of religion, of the assemblies, of the laws, and of all matters\r\npertaining to the city.\" All cheerfully promising their utmost\r\nendeavours in the discharge of their apportioned offices, Valerius,\r\nchosen as his associate in command, added, \"that Marcus Furius should be\r\nconsidered by him as dictator, and that he would act as master of the\r\nhorse to him. Wherefore, that they should entertain hopes regarding the\r\nwar, proportioned to the opinion they formed of their sole commander.\"\r\nThe senate, elated with joy, cry out, that \"they entertained good hopes,\r\nboth regarding war, and peace, and the republic in general; and that the\r\nrepublic would never have need of a dictator, if it were to have such\r\nmen in office, united together in such harmony of sentiments, prepared\r\nalike to obey and to command, and who were laying up praise as common\r\nstock, rather than taking it from the common fund to themselves\r\nindividually.\"\r\n\r\n7. A suspension of civil business being proclaimed, and a levy being\r\nheld, Furius and Valerius set out to Satricum; to which place the\r\nAntians had drawn together not only the youth of the Volscians, selected\r\nout of the new generation, but immense numbers of the Latins and\r\nHernicians, out of states which by a long [enjoyment of] peace were in\r\nthe most unimpaired condition. The new enemy then added to the old shook\r\nthe spirits of the Roman soldiers. When the centurions reported this to\r\nCamillus, whilst forming his line of battle, that \"the minds of the\r\nsoldiers were disturbed, that arms were taken up by them with\r\nbackwardness, and that they left the camp with hesitation and\r\nreluctance; nay, that some expressions were heard, that they should each\r\nhave to fight with one hundred enemies, and that such numbers, even if\r\nunarmed, much less when furnished with arms, could with difficulty be\r\nwithstood,\" he leaped on his horse, and in front of the troops, turning\r\nto the line, and riding between the ranks, \"What dejection of mind is\r\nthis, soldiers, what backwardness? Is it with the enemy, or me, or\r\nyourselves you are unacquainted? What else are the enemy, but the\r\nconstant subject of your bravery and your glory? on the other hand, with\r\nme as your general, to say nothing of the taking of Falerii and Veii,\r\nyou have lately celebrated a triple triumph for a three-fold victory\r\nover these self-same Volscians and Æquans, and Etruria. Do you not\r\nrecognise me as your general, because I gave you the signal, not as\r\ndictator, but as tribune? I neither feel the want of the highest\r\nauthority over you, and you should look to nothing in me but myself; for\r\nthe dictatorship neither added to my courage, any more than exile took\r\nit from me. We are all therefore the same individuals; and as we bring\r\nto this war the same requisites as we brought to former wars, let us\r\nlook for the same result of the war. As soon as you commence the fight,\r\neach will do that which he has learned and been accustomed to do. You\r\nwill conquer, they will run.\"\r\n\r\n8. Then having given the signal, he leaps from his horse, and seizing\r\nthe standard-bearer who was next him by the hand, he hurries him on with\r\nhim against the enemy, calling aloud, \"Soldiers, advance the standard.\"\r\nAnd when they saw Camillus himself, now disabled through age for bodily\r\nexertion, advancing against the enemy, they all rush forwards together,\r\nhaving raised a shout, each eagerly crying out, \"Follow the general.\"\r\nThey say further that the standard was thrown into the enemy's line by\r\norder of Camillus, and that the van was then exerted to recover it. That\r\nthere first the Antians were forced to give way, and that the panic\r\nspread not only to the first line, but to the reserve troops also. Nor\r\nwas it merely the ardour of the soldiers animated by the presence of\r\ntheir general that made this impression, but because nothing was more\r\nterrible to the minds of the Volscians, than the sight of Camillus which\r\nhappened to present itself. Thus, in whatever direction he went, he\r\ncarried certain victory with him. This was particularly evident, when,\r\nhastily mounting his horse, he rode with a footman's shield to the left\r\nwing, which was almost giving way, by the fact of showing himself he\r\nrestored the battle, pointing out the rest of the line gaining the\r\nvictory. Now the result was decided, but the flight of the enemy was\r\nimpeded by their great numbers, and the wearied soldiers would have had\r\ntedious work in putting so great a number to the sword, when rain\r\nsuddenly falling with a violent storm, put an end to the pursuit of the\r\nvictory which was now decided, rather than to the battle. Then the\r\nsignal for retreat being given, the fall of night put an end to the war,\r\nwithout further trouble to the Romans. For the Latins and Hernicians,\r\nhaving abandoned the Volscians, marched to their homes, having attained\r\nresults corresponding to their wicked measures. The Volscians, when they\r\nsaw themselves deserted by those through reliance on whom they had\r\nresumed hostilities, abandoned their camp, and shut themselves up within\r\nthe walls of Satricum. Camillus at first prepared to surround them by\r\nlines of circumvallation, and to prosecute the siege by a mound and\r\nother works. But seeing that this was obstructed by no sally from the\r\ntown, and considering that the enemy possessed too little spirit for him\r\nto wait in tedious expectation of victory under the circumstances, after\r\nexhorting his soldiers not to waste themselves by tedious labours, as\r\n[they had done] when besieging Veii, that the victory was in their\r\nhands, he attacked the walls on every side, amid the great alacrity of\r\nthe soldiers, and took the town by scalade. The Volscians, having thrown\r\ndown their arms, surrendered themselves.\r\n\r\n9. But the general's thoughts were fixed on a higher object, on Antium:\r\n[he knew] that that was the great aim of the Volscians, and main source\r\nof the late war. But because so strong a city could not be taken without\r\ngreat preparations, engines and machines, leaving his colleague with the\r\narmy, he set out for Rome, in order to advise the senate to have Antium\r\ndestroyed. In the middle of his discourse, (I suppose that it was the\r\nwish of the gods that the state of Antium should last a longer time,)\r\nambassadors came from Nepete and Sutrium, soliciting aid against the\r\nEtrurians, urging that the time for giving them aid would soon pass by.\r\nThither did fortune avert the force of Camillus from Antium; for as\r\nthose places were situate opposite Etruria, and were barriers or gates\r\nas it were on that side, both they had a wish to get possession of them,\r\nwhenever they meditated any new enterprise, and the Romans to recover\r\nand secure them. Wherefore the senate resolved to treat with Camillus,\r\nthat he would relinquish Antium and undertake the Etrurian war. The city\r\ntroops, which Quinctius had commanded, are decreed to him. Though he\r\nwould have preferred the army which was in the Volscian territory, as\r\nbeing tried and accustomed to him, he made no objection: he only\r\ndemanded Valerius as his associate in command. Quinctius and Horatius\r\nwere sent against the Volscians, as successors to Valerius. Furius and\r\nValerius, having set out from the city to Sutrium, found one part of the\r\ntown already taken by the Etrurians, and on the other part, the\r\napproaches to which were barricaded, the townsmen with difficulty\r\nrepelling the assault of the enemy. Both the approach of aid from Rome,\r\nas also the name of Camillus, universally respected both with the enemy\r\nand the allies, sustained their tottering state for the present, and\r\nafforded time for bringing them relief. Accordingly Camillus, having\r\ndivided his army, orders his colleague to lead round his troops to that\r\nside which the enemy already possessed, and to assault the walls; not so\r\nmuch from any hope that the city could be taken by scalade, as that, by\r\nturning away the enemy's attention to that quarter, both the townsmen\r\nwho were wearied with fighting might have some relaxation of their toil,\r\nand that he himself might have an opportunity of entering the city\r\nwithout a contest. This having been done on both sides, and the double\r\nterror now surrounding the Etrurians, when they saw that the walls were\r\nassailed with the utmost fury, and that the enemy were within the walls,\r\nthey threw themselves out in consternation, in one body, by a gate which\r\nalone happened not to be guarded. Great slaughter was made on them as\r\nthey fled, both in the city and through the fields. The greater number\r\nwere slain within the walls by Furius' soldiers: those of Valerius were\r\nmore alert for the pursuit; nor did they put an end to the slaughter\r\nuntil night, which prevented them from seeing. Sutrium being recovered\r\nand restored to the allies, the army was led to Nepete, which having\r\nbeen received by capitulation, was now entirely in the possession of the\r\nEtrurians.\r\n\r\n10. It appeared probable, that there would be more of labour in\r\nrecovering the city, not only for this reason, because it was all in\r\npossession of the enemy, but also because the surrender had been made in\r\nconsequence of a party of the Nepesinians having betrayed the state. It\r\nwas determined, however, that a message should be sent to their leading\r\nmen, to separate themselves from the Etrurians, and that they themselves\r\nshould evince that strict fidelity, which they had implored from the\r\nRomans. Whence as soon as an answer was brought that there was nothing\r\nin their power, that the Etrurians occupied the walls and the guards of\r\nthe gates, first, terror was struck into the townsmen by laying waste\r\ntheir land; then, when the faith of the capitulation was more\r\nreligiously observed than that of the alliance, the army was led up to\r\nthe walls with fascines of bushes collected from the fields, and the\r\nditches being filled, the scaling ladders were raised, and the town was\r\ntaken at the first shout and attack. Proclamation was then made to the\r\nNepesinians, that they should lay down their arms, and orders were given\r\nthat the unarmed should be spared. The Etrurians, armed and unarmed,\r\nwere put to the sword without distinction: of the Nepesinians also the\r\nauthors of the surrender were beheaded. To the unoffending multitude\r\ntheir property was restored, and the town was left with a garrison. Thus\r\nhaving recovered two allied cities from the enemy, the tribunes marched\r\nback their victorious army to Rome. During the same year restitution was\r\ndemanded from the Latins and Hernicians, and the cause was asked why\r\nthey had not during some years supplied soldiers according to\r\nstipulation. An answer was given in a full assembly of both nations,\r\n\"that neither the blame was public, nor was there any design in the\r\ncircumstance of some of their youth having served among the Volscians.\r\nThat these individuals, however, suffered the penalty of their improper\r\nconduct, and that none of them had returned. But that the cause of their\r\nnot supplying the soldiers had been their continual terror from the\r\nVolscians, which pest adhering to their side, had not been capable of\r\nbeing destroyed by so many successive wars.\" Which answer being reported\r\nto the senate, they decided that there was wanting rather a seasonable\r\ntime for declaring war than sufficient grounds for it.\r\n\r\n11. In the following year, Aulus Manlius, Publius Cornelius, Titus and\r\nLucius Quintii Capitolini, Lucius Papirius Cursor a second time, Caius\r\nSergius a second time, being military tribunes with consular power, a\r\ngrievous war broke out abroad, a still more grievous disturbance at\r\nhome; the war originated on the part of the Volscians, to which was\r\nadded a revolt of the Latins and Hernicians; the sedition from one from\r\nwhom it could be least of all apprehended, a man of patrician birth and\r\ndistinguished character, Marcus Manlius Capitolinus; who being too\r\naspiring in mind, whilst he despised the other leading men, envied one,\r\nwho was peculiarly distinguished both by honours and by merit, Marcus\r\nFurius: he became indignant that he should be the only man among the\r\nmagistrates; the only man at the head of the armies; that he now\r\nattained such eminence that he treated not as colleagues but as mere\r\ntools the persons elected under the same auspices; though, in the mean\r\ntime, if any one would form a just estimate, his country could not have\r\nbeen recovered by Marcus Furius from the siege of the enemy, had not the\r\nCapitol and citadel been first preserved by him; and the other attacked\r\nthe Gauls, whilst their attention was distracted between receiving the\r\ngold and the hope of peace, when he himself drove them off when armed\r\nand taking the citadel; of the other's glory, a man's share appertained\r\nto all the soldiers who conquered along with him; that in his victory no\r\nman living was a sharer. His mind puffed by these notions, and moreover,\r\nfrom a viciousness of disposition being vehement and headstrong, when he\r\nperceived that his influence among the patricians did not stand forth as\r\nprominent as he thought it should, he, the first of all the patricians,\r\nbecame a plebeian partisan, and formed plans in conjunction with the\r\nplebeian magistrates; and by criminating the fathers, and alluring the\r\ncommons to his side, he now came to be carried along by the tide of\r\npopular applause, not by prudence, and preferred to be of a great,\r\nrather than of a good character: and not content with agrarian laws,\r\nwhich had ever served the tribunes of the commons as material for\r\ndisturbances, he now began to undermine public credit; for [he well\r\nknew] \"that the incentives of debt were sharper, as not only threatening\r\npoverty and ignominy, but intimidated personal liberty with stocks and\r\nchains.\" And the amount of the debt was immense, contracted by building,\r\na circumstance most destructive even to the rich. The Volscian war\r\ntherefore, heavy in itself, charged with additional weight by the\r\ndefection of the Latins and Hernicians, was held out as a colourable\r\npretext, for having a higher authority resorted to. But it was rather\r\nthe reforming plans that drove the senate to create a dictator. Aulus\r\nCornelius Cossus having been elected dictator, nominated Titus Quinctius\r\nCapitolinus his master of the horse.\r\n\r\n12. The dictator, though he perceived that a greater struggle was\r\nreserved for him at home than abroad; still, either because there was\r\nneed of despatch for the war, or supposing that by a victory and a\r\ntriumph he should add to the powers of the dictatorship itself, held a\r\nlevee and proceeds into the Pomptine territory, where he had heard that\r\nthe Volscians had appointed their army to assemble. I doubt not but\r\nthat, in addition to satiety, to persons reading of so many wars waged\r\nwith the Volscians, this same circumstance will suggest itself, which\r\noften served as an occasion of surprise to me when perusing the writers\r\nwho lived nearer to the times of these occurrences, from what source the\r\nVolscians and Æquans, so often vanquished, could have procured supplies\r\nof soldiers. And as this has been unnoticed and passed over in silence\r\nby ancient writers; on which matter what can I state, except mere\r\nopinion, which every one may from his own conjecture form for himself?\r\nIt seems probable, either that they employed, as is now practised in the\r\nRoman levies, successive generations of their young men one after the\r\nother, during the intervals between the wars; or that the armies were\r\nnot always recruited out of the same states, though the same nation may\r\nhave made war; or that there was an innumerable multitude of free-men in\r\nthose places, which, at the present day, Roman slaves save from being a\r\ndesert, a scanty seminary of soldiers being scarcely left. Certain it\r\nis, (as is agreed upon among all authors,) although their power was very\r\nmuch impaired under the guidance and auspices of Camillus, the forces of\r\nthe Volscians were strong: besides, the Latins and Hernicians had been\r\nadded, and some of the Circeians, and some Roman colonists also from\r\nVelitræ. The dictator, having pitched his camp on that day, and on\r\ncoming forth on the day following after taking the auspices, and having,\r\nby sacrificing a victim, implored the favour of the gods, with joyful\r\ncountenance presented himself to the soldiers, who were now taking arms\r\nat day-break, according to orders, on the signal for battle being\r\ndisplayed. \"Soldiers,\" says he, \"the victory is ours, if the gods and\r\ntheir prophets see aught into futurity. Accordingly, as it becomes men\r\nfull of well-grounded hope, and who are about to engage with their\r\ninferiors, let us place our spears at our feet, and arm our right hands\r\nonly with our swords. I would not even wish that any should push forward\r\nbeyond the line; but that, standing firm, you receive the enemy's charge\r\nin a steady posture. When they shall have discharged their ineffective\r\nmissives, and, breaking their ranks, they shall rush on you as you stand\r\nfirm, then let your swords glitter, and let each man recollect, that\r\nthere are gods who aid the Roman; those gods, who have sent us into\r\nbattle with favourable omens. Do you, Titus Quinctius, keep back the\r\ncavalry, attentively observing the very commencement of the contest; as\r\nsoon as you observe the armies closed foot to foot, then, whilst they\r\nare taken up with another panic, strike terror into them with your\r\ncavalry, and by making a charge on them, disperse the ranks of those\r\nengaged in the fight.\" The cavalry, the infantry conduct the fight, just\r\nas he had ordered them. Nor did either the general disappoint the\r\nlegions, nor fortune the general.\r\n\r\n13. The army of the enemy, relying on nothing but on their number, and\r\nmeasuring both armies merely by the eye, entered on the battle\r\ninconsiderately, and inconsiderately gave it over: fierce only in their\r\nshout and with their missive weapons, and at the first onset of the\r\nfight, they were unable to withstand the swords, and the close\r\nengagement foot to foot, and the looks of the enemy, darting fire\r\nthrough their ardour for the fight. Their front line was driven in, and\r\nconfusion spread to the reserve troops, and the cavalry occasioned alarm\r\non their part: the ranks were then broken in many places, every thing\r\nwas set in motion, and the line seemed as it were fluctuating. Then\r\nwhen, the foremost having fallen, each saw that death was about to reach\r\nhimself, they turn their backs. The Roman followed close on them; and as\r\nlong as they went off armed and in bodies, the labour in the pursuit\r\nfell to the infantry; when it was observed that their arms were thrown\r\naway in every direction, and that the enemy's line was scattered in\r\nflight through the country; then squadrons of horse were sent out,\r\nintimation being given that they should not, by losing time with the\r\nmassacre of individuals, afford an opportunity in the mean time to the\r\nmultitude to escape: it would be sufficient that their speed should be\r\nretarded by missive weapons and by terror, and that the progress of\r\ntheir forces should be detained by skirmishing, until the infantry\r\nshould be able to overtake and despatch the enemy by regular slaughter.\r\nThere was no end of the flight and slaughter before night; on the same\r\nday the camp of the Volscians was taken also and pillaged, and all the\r\nplunder, save the persons of free condition, was given up to the\r\nsoldiers. The greatest part of the prisoners consisted of Latins and\r\nHernicians, and these not men of plebeian rank, so that it could be\r\nsupposed that they had served for hire, but some young men of rank were\r\nfound among them: an evident proof that the Volscian enemies had been\r\naided by public authority. Some of the Circeians also were recognised,\r\nand colonists from Velitræ; and being all sent to Rome, on being\r\ninterrogated by the leading senators, plainly revealed the same\r\ncircumstances as they had done to the dictator, the defection each of\r\nhis respective state.\r\n\r\n14. The dictator kept his army in the standing camp, not at all doubting\r\nthat the senate would order war with these states; when a more momentous\r\ndifficulty having occurred at home, rendered it necessary that he should\r\nbe sent for to Rome, the sedition gaining strength every day, which the\r\nfomenter was now rendering more than ordinarily formidable. For now it\r\nwas easy to see from what motives proceeded not only the discourses of\r\nManlius, but his actions also, apparently suggested by popular zeal, but\r\nat the same time tending to create disturbance. When he saw a centurion,\r\nillustrious for his military exploits, leading off to prison by reason\r\nof a judgment for debt, he ran up with his attendants in the middle of\r\nthe forum and laid hands on him; and exclaiming aloud against the\r\ninsolence of the patricians, the cruelty of the usurers, and the\r\ngrievances of the commons, and the deserts and misfortunes of the man.\r\n\"Then indeed,\" said he, \"in vain have I preserved the Capitol and\r\ncitadel by this right hand, if I am to see my fellow-citizen and\r\nfellow-soldier, as if captured by the victorious Gauls, dragged into\r\nslavery and chains.\" He then paid the debt to the creditor openly before\r\nthe people, and having purchased his freedom with the scales and brass,\r\nhe sets the man at liberty, whilst the latter implored both gods and\r\nmen, that they would grant a recompence to Marcus Manlius, his\r\nliberator, the parent of the Roman commons; and being immediately\r\nreceived into the tumultuous crowd, he himself also increased the\r\ntumult, displaying the scars received in the Veientian, Gallic, and\r\nother succeeding wars: \"that he, whilst serving in the field, and\r\nrebuilding his dwelling which had been demolished, though he had paid\r\noff the principal many times over, the interest always keeping down the\r\nprincipal, had been overwhelmed with interest: that through the kind\r\ninterference of Marcus Manlius, he now beheld the light, the forum, and\r\nthe faces of his fellow-citizens: that he received from him all the kind\r\nservices usually conferred by parents; that to him therefore he devoted\r\nwhatever remained of his person, of his life, and of his blood; whatever\r\nties subsisted between him and his country, public and private guardian\r\ndeities, were all centred in that one man.\" When the commons, worked\r\nupon by these expressions, were now wholly in the interest of the one\r\nindividual, another circumstance was added, emanating from a scheme\r\nstill more effectually calculated to create general confusion. A farm in\r\nthe Veientian territory, the principal part of his estate, he subjected\r\nto public sale: \"that I may not,\" says he, \"suffer any of you, Romans,\r\nas long as any of my property shall remain, to be dragged off to prison,\r\nafter judgment has been given against him, and he has been consigned to\r\na creditor.\" That circumstance, indeed, so inflamed their minds, that\r\nthey seemed determined on following the assertor of their freedom\r\nthrough every thing, right and wrong. Besides this, speeches [were made]\r\nat his house, as if he were delivering an harangue, full of imputations\r\nagainst the patricians; among which he threw out, waving all distinction\r\nwhether he said what was true or false, that treasures of the Gallic\r\ngold were concealed by the patricians; that \"they were now no longer\r\ncontent with possessing the public lands, unless they appropriated the\r\npublic money also; if that were made public, that the commons might be\r\nfreed from their debt.\" When this hope was presented to them, then\r\nindeed it seemed a scandalous proceeding, that when gold was to be\r\ncontributed to ransom the state from the Gauls, the collection was made\r\nby a public tribute; that the same gold, when taken from the Gauls, had\r\nbecome the plunder of a few. Accordingly they followed up the inquiry,\r\nwhere the furtive possession of so enormous a treasure could be kept;\r\nand when he deferred, and told them that he would inform them at the\r\nproper time, all other objects being given up, the attention of all was\r\ndirected to this point; and it became evident that neither their\r\ngratitude, if the information were true, nor their displeasure if it\r\nproved false, would know any bounds.\r\n\r\n15. Matters being in this state, the dictator, being summoned home from\r\nthe army, came into the city. A meeting of the senate being held on the\r\nfollowing day, when, having sufficiently sounded the inclinations of the\r\npeople, he forbade the senate to leave him, attended by that body, he\r\nplaced his throne in the comitium, and sent his sergeant to Marcus\r\nManlius; who on being summoned by the dictator's order, after he had\r\ngiven intimation to his party that a contest was at hand, came to the\r\ntribunal, attended by a numerous party. On the one side stood the\r\nsenate, on the other the people as if in battle-array, attentively\r\nobserving, each party, their respective leader. Then silence being made,\r\nthe dictator said, \"I wish that I and the Roman patricians may agree\r\nwith the commons on all other matters, as I am confident we shall agree\r\non the business which regards you, and on that about which I am about to\r\ninterrogate you. I perceive that hopes have been raised by you in the\r\nminds of the citizens, that, with safety to the public credit, their\r\ndebts may be paid off out of the Gallic treasures, which it is alleged\r\nthe leading patricians are secreting. To which proceeding so far am I\r\nfrom being any obstruction, that on the contrary, Marcus Manlius, I\r\nexhort you to free the Roman commons from the weight of interest; and to\r\ntumble from their secreted spoil, those who lie now brooding on those\r\npublic treasures. If you refuse to do this, whether because you yourself\r\ndesire to be a sharer in the spoil, or because the information is\r\nunfounded, I shall order you to be carried off to prison, nor will I any\r\nlonger suffer the multitude to be disquieted by you with delusive\r\nhopes.\" To this Manlius replied, \"That it had not escaped him, that it\r\nwas not against the Volscians, who were enemies as often as it suited\r\nthe interests of the patricians, nor against the Latins and Hernicians,\r\nwhom they were driving into hostilities by false charges, but against\r\nhim and the Roman commons, that he was appointed dictator. Now the war\r\nbeing dropped, which was only feigned, that an attack was being made\r\nagainst himself; that the dictator now professed to defend the usurers\r\nagainst the commons; that now a charge and destruction was sought for\r\nhim out of the favour of the multitude. Does the crowd that surrounds my\r\nperson offend you,\" said he, \"Aulus Cornelius, and you, conscript\r\nfathers? Why then do you not draw it away from me, each of you by your\r\nown acts of kindness? by becoming surety, by delivering your\r\nfellow-citizens from the stocks, by preventing those cast in law-suits,\r\nand assigned over to their creditors, from being dragged away to prison,\r\nby sustaining the necessities of others out of your own superfluities?\r\nBut why do I exhort you to expend out of your own property? Fix some\r\ncapital; deduct from the principal what has been paid in interest; soon\r\nwill my crowd not be a whit more remarkable than that of any other\r\nperson. But [I may be asked] why do I alone thus interest myself in\r\nbehalf of my fellow-citizens? I have no other answer to give, than if\r\nyou were to ask me, why in the same way did I alone preserve the Capitol\r\nand the citadel. Both then I afforded the aid which I could to all\r\ncollectively, and now I will afford it to each individually. Now with\r\nrespect to the Gallic treasures, the mode of interrogation renders\r\ndifficult a matter which in itself is easy. For why do you ask that\r\nwhich you know? why do you order that which is in your own laps to be\r\nshaken out of them rather than resign it, unless some fraud lurks\r\nbeneath? The more you require your own impositions to be examined into,\r\nthe more do I dread lest you should blind the eyes of those narrowly\r\nwatching you. Wherefore, it is not I that am to be compelled to discover\r\nyour hoard, but you must be forced to produce it to the public.\"\r\n\r\n16. When the dictator ordered him to lay aside evasion, and urged him to\r\nprove the truth of his information, or to own the guilt of having\r\nadvanced a false accusation against the senate, and of having exposed\r\nthem to the odium of a lying charge of concealment; when he refused to\r\nspeak, to meet the wishes of his enemies, he ordered him to be carried\r\noff to prison. When arrested by the sergeant, he said, \"O Jupiter,\r\nsupremely great and good, imperial Juno, and Minerva, and ye other gods\r\nand goddesses, who inhabit the Capitol and citadel, do ye suffer your\r\nsoldier and defender to be thus harassed by his enemies? Shall this\r\nright hand, by which I beat off the Gauls from your temples, be now in\r\nbonds and chains?\" Neither the eyes nor ears of any one could well\r\nendure the indignity [thus offered him], but the state, most patient of\r\nlegitimate authority, had rendered certain offices absolute to\r\nthemselves; nor did either the tribunes of the commons, nor the commons\r\nthemselves, dare to raise their eyes or utter a sentence in opposition\r\nto the dictatorial power. On Manlius being thrown into prison, it\r\nappears that a great part of the commons put on mourning, that a great\r\nmany persons had let their hair and beard grow, and that a dejected\r\ncrowd presented itself at the entrance of the prison. The dictator\r\ntriumphed over the Volscians; and that triumph was the occasion rather\r\nof ill-will than of glory. For they murmured that \"it had been acquired\r\nat home, not abroad, and that it was celebrated over a citizen, not over\r\nan enemy; that only one thing was wanting to his arrogance, that Manlius\r\nwas not led before his car.\" And now the affair fell little short of\r\nsedition, for the purpose of appeasing which, the senate, without the\r\nsolicitation of any one, suddenly becoming bountiful of their own\r\nfree-will, decreed that a colony of two thousand Roman citizens should\r\nbe conducted to Satricum; two acres and half of land were assigned to\r\neach. And when they considered this, both as scanty in itself, conferred\r\non a few, and as a bribe for betraying Marcus Manlius, the sedition was\r\nirritated by the remedy. And now the crowd of Manlius' partisans was\r\nbecome more remarkable, both by their squalid attire and by the\r\nappearance of persons under prosecutions, and terror being removed by\r\nthe resignation of the dictatorship, after the triumph had set both the\r\ntongues and thoughts of men at liberty.\r\n\r\n17. Expressions were therefore heard freely uttered of persons\r\nupbraiding the multitude, that \"by their favour they always raised their\r\ndefenders to a precipice, then at the very critical moment of danger\r\nthey forsook them. That in this way Spurius Cassius, when inviting the\r\ncommons to a share in the lands, in this way Spurius Mælius, when\r\nwarding off famine from the mouths of his fellow-citizens at his own\r\nexpense, had been undone; thus Marcus Manlius was betrayed to his\r\nenemies, whilst drawing forth to liberty and light one half of the\r\nstate, when sunk and overwhelmed with usury. That the commons fattened\r\ntheir favourites that they might be slaughtered. Was this punishment to\r\nbe suffered, if a man of consular rank did not answer at the nod of a\r\ndictator? Suppose that he had lied before, and that on that account he\r\nhad had no answer to make; what slave was ever imprisoned in punishment\r\nof a lie? Did not the memory of that night present itself, which was\r\nwell nigh the last and an eternal one to the Roman name? nor any idea of\r\nthe band of Gauls climbing up the Tarpeian rock? nor that of Marcus\r\nManlius himself, such as they had seen him in arms, covered with sweat\r\nand blood, after having in a manner rescued Jupiter himself from the\r\nhands of the enemy? Was a recompence made to the preserver of their\r\ncountry with their half pounds of corn? and would they suffer a person,\r\nwhom they almost deified, whom they had set on a footing with Jupiter,\r\nat least with respect to the surname of Capitolinus, to drag out an\r\nexistence subject to the will of an executioner, chained in a prison and\r\nin darkness? Was there thus sufficient aid in one person for all; and no\r\nrelief for one in so many?\" The crowd did not disperse from that place\r\neven during the night, and they threatened that they would break open\r\nthe prison; when that being conceded which they were about to take by\r\nforce, Manlius was discharged from prison by a decree of the senate; by\r\nwhich proceeding the sedition was not terminated, but a leader was\r\nsupplied to the sedition. About the same time the Latins and Hernicians,\r\nas also the colonists of Circeii and Velitræ, when striving to clear\r\nthemselves of the charge [of being concerned] in the Volscian war, and\r\ndemanding back the prisoners, that they may punish them according to\r\ntheir own laws, received a harsh answer; the colonists the severer,\r\nbecause being Roman citizens they had formed the abominable design of\r\nattacking their own country. They were therefore not only refused with\r\nrespect to the prisoners, but notice was given them in the name of the\r\nsenate, who however forbore from such a proceeding in the case of the\r\nallies, instantly to depart from the city, from the presence and sight\r\nof the Roman people; lest the law of embassy, provided for the\r\nforeigner, not for the citizen, should afford them no protection.\r\n\r\n18. The sedition excited by Manlius reassuming its former violence, on\r\nthe expiration of the year the election was held, and military tribunes\r\nwith consular power were elected from among the patricians; they were\r\nServius Cornelius Maluginensis a third time, Publius Valerius Potitus a\r\nsecond time, Marcus Furius Camillus, Servius Sulpicius Rufus a second\r\ntime, Caius Papirius Crassus, Titus Quinctius Cincinnatus a second time.\r\nAt the commencement of which year peace with foreign countries afforded\r\nevery opportunity both to the patricians and plebeians: to the\r\nplebeians, because not being called away by any levy, they conceived\r\nhopes of destroying usury, whilst they had so influential a leader; to\r\nthe patricians, because their minds were not called away by any external\r\nterror from relieving the evils existing at home. Accordingly, as both\r\nsides arose much more strenuous then ever, Manlius also was present for\r\nthe approaching contest. Having summoned the commons to his house, he\r\nholds consultations both by night and day with the leading men amongst\r\nthem with respect to effecting a revolution of affairs, being filled\r\nwith a much higher degree both of spirit and of resentment than he had\r\nbeen before. The recent ignominy had lighted up resentment in a mind\r\nunused to affront; it gave him additional courage, that the dictator had\r\nnot ventured to the same extent against him, as Quinctius Cincinnatus\r\nhad done in the case of Spurius Mælius, and because the dictator had not\r\nonly endeavoured to avoid the unpopularity of his imprisonment by\r\nabdicating the dictatorship, but not even the senate could bear up\r\nagainst it. Elated by these considerations, and at the same time\r\nexasperated, he set about inflaming the minds of the commons, already\r\nsufficiently heated of themselves: \"How long,\" says he, \"will you be\r\nignorant of your own strength, which nature has not wished even the\r\nbrutes to be ignorant of? At least count how many you are, and how many\r\nenemies you have. Even if each of you were to attack an individual\r\nantagonist, still I should suppose that you would strive more vigorously\r\nin defence of liberty, than they in defence of tyranny. For as many of\r\nyou as have been clients around each single patron, in the same number\r\nwill ye be against a single enemy. Only make a show of war; ye shall\r\nhave peace. Let them see you prepared for open force; they themselves\r\nwill relax their pretensions. Collectively you must attempt something,\r\nor individually submit to every thing. How long will you look to me? I\r\nfor my part will not be wanting to any of you: do you see that my\r\nfortune fail not. I, your avenger, when my enemies thought well of it,\r\nwas suddenly reduced to nothing; and you all in a body beheld that\r\nperson thrown into chains, who had warded off chains from each one of\r\nyou. What am I to hope, if my enemies attempt more against me? Am I to\r\nexpect the fate of Cassius and Mælius? You acted kindly in appearing\r\nshocked at it: the gods will avert it: but never will they come down\r\nfrom heaven on my account: they must inspire you with a determination to\r\navert it; as they inspired me, in arms and in peace, to defend you from\r\nbarbarous foes and tyrannical fellow-citizens. Is the spirit of so great\r\na people so mean, that aid against your adversaries always satisfies\r\nyou? And are you not to know any contest against the patricians, except\r\nhow you may suffer them to domineer over you? Nor is this implanted in\r\nyou by nature; but you are theirs by possession. For why is it you bear\r\nsuch spirit with respect to foreigners, as to think it meet that you\r\nshould rule over them? because you have been accustomed to vie with them\r\nfor empire, against these to essay liberty rather than to maintain it.\r\nNevertheless, whatsoever sort of leaders you have, whatever has been\r\nyour own conduct, ye have up to this carried every thing which ye have\r\ndemanded, either by force, or your own good fortune. It is now time to\r\naim at still higher objects. Only make trial both of your own good\r\nfortune, and of me, who have been, as I hope, already tried to your\r\nadvantage. Ye will with less difficulty set up some one to rule the\r\npatricians, than ye have set up persons to resist their rule.\r\nDictatorships and consulships must be levelled to the ground, that the\r\nRoman commons may be able to raise their heads. Wherefore stand by me,\r\nprevent judicial proceedings from going on regarding money. I profess\r\nmyself the patron of the commons--a title with which my solicitude and\r\nzeal invests me. If you will dignify your leader by any more\r\ndistinguishing title of honour or command, ye will render him still more\r\npowerful to obtain what ye desire.\" From this his first attempt is said\r\nto have arisen with respect to the obtaining of regal power; but no\r\nsufficiently clear account is handed down, either with whom [he acted],\r\nor how far his designs extended.\r\n\r\n19. But, on the other side, the senate began to deliberate regarding the\r\nsecession of the commons into a private house, and that, as it so\r\nhappened, situate in the citadel, and regarding the great danger that\r\nwas threatening liberty. Great numbers cry out, that a Servilius Ahala\r\nwas wanted, who would not irritate a public enemy by ordering him to be\r\nled to prison, but would finish an intestine war with the loss of one\r\ncitizen. They came to a resolution milder in terms, but possessing the\r\nsame force, that the magistrates should see that \"the commonwealth\r\nreceived no detriment from the designs of Marcus Manlius.\" Then the\r\nconsular tribunes, and the tribunes of the commons, (for these also had\r\nsubmitted to the authority of the senate, because they saw that the\r\ntermination of their own power and of the liberty of all would be the\r\nsame,) all these then consult together as to what was necessary to be\r\ndone. When nothing suggested itself to the mind of any, except violence\r\nand bloodshed, and it was evident that that would be attended with great\r\nrisk; then Marcus Mænius, and Quintus Publilius, tribunes of the\r\ncommons, say, \"Why do we make that a contest between the patricians and\r\ncommons, which ought to be between the state and one pestilent citizen?\r\nWhy do we attack, together with the commons, a man whom it is safer to\r\nattack through the commons themselves, that he may fall overpowered by\r\nhis own strength? We have it in contemplation to appoint a day of trial\r\nfor him. Nothing is less popular than regal power; as soon as the\r\nmultitude shall perceive that the contest is not with them, and that\r\nfrom advocates they are to be made judges, and shall behold the\r\nprosecutors from among the commons, the accused a patrician, and that\r\nthe charge between both parties is that of aiming at regal power, they\r\nwill favour no object more than their own liberty.\"\r\n\r\n20. With the approbation of all, they appoint a day of trial for\r\nManlius. When this took place, the commons were at first excited,\r\nespecially when they saw the accused in a mourning habit, and with him\r\nnot only none of the patricians, but not even any of his kinsmen or\r\nrelatives, nay, not even his brothers Aulus and Titus Manlius; a\r\ncircumstance which had never occurred before, that at so critical a\r\njuncture a man's nearest friends did not put on mourning. When Appius\r\nClaudius was thrown into prison [they remarked], that Caius Claudius,\r\nwho was at enmity with him and the entire Claudian family, appeared in\r\nmourning; that this favourite of the people was about to be destroyed by\r\na conspiracy, because he was the first who had come over from the\r\npatricians to the commons. When the day arrived, I find in no author,\r\nwhat acts were alleged by the prosecutors against the accused bearing\r\nproperly on the charge of aspiring to kingly power, except his\r\nassembling the multitude, and his seditious expressions and his\r\nlargesses, and pretended discovery; nor have I any doubt that they were\r\nby no means unimportant, as the people's delay in condemning him was\r\noccasioned not by the merits of the cause, but by the place of trial.\r\nThis seems deserving of notice, that men may know what great and\r\nglorious achievements his depraved ambition of regal power rendered not\r\nonly bereft of all merit, but absolutely hateful. He is said to have\r\nbrought forward near four hundred persons to whom he had lent money\r\nwithout interest, whose goods he had prevented from being sold, whom he\r\nhad prevented from being carried off to prison after being adjudged to\r\ntheir creditors. Besides this, that he not only enumerated also his\r\nmilitary rewards, but also produced them to view; spoils of enemies\r\nslain up to thirty; presents from generals to the number of forty; in\r\nwhich the most remarkable were two mural crowns and eight civic. In\r\naddition to this, that he brought forward citizens saved from the enemy,\r\namongst whom was mentioned Caius Servilius, when master of the horse,\r\nnow absent. Then after he had recounted his exploits in war, in pompous\r\nlanguage suitable to the dignity of the subject, equalling his actions\r\nby his eloquence, he bared his breast marked with scars received in\r\nbattle: and now and then, directing his eyes to the Capitol, he called\r\ndown Jupiter and the other gods to aid him in his present lot; and he\r\nprayed, that the same sentiments with which they had inspired him when\r\nprotecting the fortress of the Capitol, for the preservation of the\r\nRoman people, they would now inspire the Roman people with in his\r\ncritical situation: and he entreated them singly and collectively, that\r\nthey would form their judgment of him with their eyes fixed on the\r\nCapitol and citadel and their faces turned to the immortal gods. As the\r\npeople were summoned by centuries in the field of Mars, and as the\r\naccused, extending his hands towards the Capitol, directed his prayers\r\nfrom men to the gods; it became evident to the tribunes, that unless\r\nthey removed the eyes of men also from the memory of so great an\r\nexploit, the best founded charge would find no place in minds\r\nprejudiced by services. Thus the day of trial being adjourned, a meeting\r\nof the people was summoned in the Pœteline grove outside the Nomentan\r\ngate, from whence there was no view of the Capitol; there the charge was\r\nmade good, and their minds being now unmoved [by adventitious\r\ncircumstances], a fatal sentence, and one which excited horror even in\r\nhis judges, was passed on him. There are some who state that he was\r\ncondemned by duumvirs appointed to inquire concerning cases of treason.\r\nThe tribunes cast him down from the Tarpeian rock: and the same place in\r\nthe case of one man became a monument of distinguished glory and of\r\nextreme punishment. Marks of infamy were offered to him when dead: one,\r\na public one; that, when his house had been that where the temple of\r\nMoneta and the mint-office now stand, it was proposed to the people,\r\nthat no patrician should dwell in the citadel and Capitol: the other\r\nappertaining to his family; it being commanded by a decree that no one\r\nof the Manlian family should ever after bear the name of Marcus Manlius.\r\nSuch was the fate of a man, who, had he not been born in a free state,\r\nwould have been celebrated with posterity. In a short time, when there\r\nwas no longer any danger from him, the people, recollecting only his\r\nvirtues, were seized with regret for him. A pestilence too which soon\r\nfollowed, no causes of so great a calamity presenting themselves, seemed\r\nto a great many to have arisen from the punishment inflicted on Manlius:\r\n\"The Capitol\" [they said] \"had been polluted with the blood of its\r\npreserver; nor was it agreeable to the gods that the punishment of him\r\nby whom their temples had been rescued from the hands of the enemy, had\r\nbeen brought in a manner before their eyes.\"\r\n\r\n21. The pestilence was succeeded by a scarcity of the fruits of the\r\nearth, and the report of both calamities by spreading [was followed] by\r\na variety of wars in the following year, Lucius Valerius a fourth time,\r\nAulus Manlius a third time, Servius Sulpicius a third time, Lucius\r\nLucretius, Lucius Æmilius a third time, Marcus Trebonius, being military\r\ntribunes with consular power. Besides the Volscians, assigned by some\r\nfatality to give eternal employment to the Roman soldiery, and the\r\ncolonies of Circeii and Velitræ, long meditating a revolt, and Latium\r\nwhich had been suspected, new enemies suddenly sprung up in the people\r\nof Lanuvium, which had been a most faithful city. The fathers,\r\nconsidering that this arose from contempt, because the revolt of their\r\nown citizens, the people of Velitræ, had been so long unpunished,\r\ndecreed that a proposition should be submitted to the people at the\r\nearliest opportunity on the subject of declaring war against them: and\r\nin order that the commons might be the more disposed for that service,\r\nthey appointed five commissioners for distributing the Pomptine land,\r\nand three for conducting a colony to Nepete. Then it was proposed to the\r\npeople that they should order a declaration of war; and the plebeian\r\ntribunes in vain endeavouring to dissuade them, all the tribes declared\r\nfor war. That year preparations were made for war; the army was not led\r\nout into the field on account of the pestilence. And that delay afforded\r\nfull time to the colonists to deprecate the anger of the senate; and a\r\ngreat number of the people were disposed that a suppliant embassy should\r\nbe sent to Rome, had not the public been involved, as is usual, with the\r\nprivate danger, and the abettors of the revolt from the Romans, through\r\nfear, lest they, being alone answerable for the guilt, might be given up\r\nas victims to the resentment of the Romans, dissuaded the colonies from\r\ncounsels of peace. And not only was the embassy obstructed by them in\r\nthe senate, but a great part of the commons were excited to make\r\npredatory excursions into the Roman territory. This new injury broke off\r\nall hope of peace. This year a report first originated regarding a\r\nrevolt of the Prænestines; and the people of Tusculum, Gabii and Lavici,\r\ninto whose territories the incursions had been made, accusing them of\r\nthe fact, the senate returned so placid an answer, that it became\r\nevident that less credit was given to the charges, because they wished\r\nthem not to be true.\r\n\r\n22. In the following year the Papirii, Spurius and Lucius, new military\r\ntribunes, led the legions to Velitræ; their four colleagues in the\r\ntribuneship, Servius Cornelius Maluginensis a fourth time, Quintus\r\nServilius, Servius Sulpicius, Lucius Æmilius a fourth time, being left\r\nbehind to protect the city, and in case any new commotion should be\r\nannounced from Etruria; for every thing was apprehended from that\r\nquarter. At Velitræ they fought a successful battle against the\r\nauxiliaries of the Prænestines, who were almost greater than the number\r\nof colonists themselves; so that the proximity of the city was both the\r\ncause of an earlier flight to the enemy, and was their only refuge after\r\nthe flight. The tribunes refrained from besieging the town, both because\r\n[the result] was uncertain, and they considered that the war should not\r\nbe pushed to the total destruction of the colony. Letters were sent to\r\nRome to the senate with news of the victory, expressive of more\r\nanimosity against the Prænestine enemy than against those of Velitræ. In\r\nconsequence, by a decree of the senate and an order of the people, war\r\nwas declared against the Prænestines: who, in conjunction with the\r\nVolscians, took, on the following year, Satricum, a colony of the Roman\r\npeople, by storm, after an obstinate defence by the colonists, and made,\r\nwith respect to the prisoners, a disgraceful use of their victory.\r\nIncensed at this, the Romans elected Marcus Furius Camillus a seventh\r\ntime military tribune. The colleagues conjoined with him were the two\r\nPostumii Regillenses, Aulus and Lucius, and Lucius Furius, with Lucius\r\nLucretius and Marcus Fabius Ambustus. The Volscian war was decreed to\r\nMarcus Furius out of the ordinary course, Lucius Furius is assigned by\r\nlot from among the tribunes his assistant; [which proved] not so\r\nadvantageous to the public as a source of all manner of praise to his\r\ncolleague: both on public grounds, because he restored the [Roman]\r\ninterest which had been prostrated by his rash conduct; and on private\r\ngrounds, because from his error he sought to obtain his gratitude rather\r\nthan his own glory. Camillus was now in the decline of life, and when\r\nprepared at the election to take the usual oath for the purpose of\r\nexcusing himself on the plea of his health, he was opposed by the\r\nconsent of the people: but his active mind was still vigorous within his\r\nardent breast, and he enjoyed all his faculties entire, and now that he\r\nconcerned himself but little in civil affairs, war still aroused him.\r\nHaving enlisted four legions of four thousand men each, and having\r\nordered the troops to assemble the next day at the Esquiline gate, he\r\nset out to Satricum. There the conquerors of the colony, nowise\r\ndismayed, confiding in their number of men, in which they had\r\nconsiderably the advantage, awaited him. When they perceived that the\r\nRomans were approaching, they marched out immediately to the field,\r\ndetermined to make no delay to put all to the risk of an engagement,\r\nthat by proceeding thus they should derive no advantage from the\r\njudgment of their distinguished commander, on which alone they confided.\r\n\r\n23. The same ardour existed also in the Roman army; nor did any thing,\r\nbut the wisdom and authority of one man, delay the fortune of the\r\npresent engagement, who sought, by protracting the war, an opportunity\r\nof aiding their strength by skill. The enemy urged them the more on that\r\naccount, and now not only did they draw out their troops in order of\r\nbattle before their camp, but advanced into the middle of the plain, and\r\nby throwing up trenches near the battalions of the enemy, made a show of\r\ntheir insolent confidence in their strength. The Roman soldier was\r\nindignant at this; the other military tribune, Lucius Furius, still more\r\nso, who, encouraged both by his youth and his natural disposition, was\r\nstill further elated by the hopes entertained by the multitude, who\r\nassumed great spirits on grounds the most uncertain. The soldiers,\r\nalready excited of themselves, he still further instigated by\r\ndisparaging the authority of his colleague by reference to his age, the\r\nonly point on which he could do so: saying constantly, \"that wars were\r\nthe province of young men, and that with the body the mind also\r\nflourishes and withers; that from having been a most vigorous warrior he\r\nwas become a drone; and that he who, on coming up, had been wont to\r\ncarry off camps and cities at the first onset, now consumed the time\r\ninactive within the trenches. What accession to his own strength, or\r\ndiminution of that of the enemy, did he hope for? What opportunity, what\r\nseason, what place for practising stratagem? that the old man's plans\r\nwere frigid and languid. Camillus had both sufficient share of life as\r\nwell as of glory. What use was it to suffer the strength of a state\r\nwhich ought to be immortal, to sink into old age along with one mortal\r\nbody.\" By such observations, he had attracted to himself the attention\r\nof the entire camp; and when in every quarter battle was called for, \"We\r\ncannot,\" he says, \"Marcus Furius, withstand the violence of the\r\nsoldiers; and the enemy, whose spirits we have increased by delaying,\r\ninsults us by insolence by no means to be borne. Do you, who are but one\r\nman, yield to all, and suffer yourself to be overcome in counsel, that\r\nyou may the sooner overcome in battle.\" To this Camillus replies, that\r\n\"whatever wars had been waged up to that day under his single auspices,\r\nin these that neither himself nor the Roman people had been\r\ndissatisfied either with his judgment or with his fortune; now he knew\r\nthat he had a colleague, his equal in command and in authority, in\r\nvigour of age superior; with respect to the army, that he had been\r\naccustomed to rule, not to be ruled; with his colleague's authority he\r\ncould not interfere. That he might do, with the favour of the gods,\r\nwhatever he might deem to be to the interest of the state. That he would\r\neven solicit for his years the indulgence, that he might not be placed\r\nin the front line; that whatever duties in war an old man could\r\ndischarge, in these he would not be deficient; that he prayed to the\r\nimmortal gods, that no mischance might prove his plan to be the more\r\nadvisable.\" Neither his salutary advice was listened to by men, nor such\r\npious prayers by the gods. The adviser of the battle draws up the front\r\nline; Camillus forms the reserve, and posts a strong guard before the\r\ncamp; he himself took his station on an elevated place as a spectator,\r\nanxiously watching the result of the other's plan.\r\n\r\n24. As soon as the arms clashed at the first encounter, the enemy, from\r\nstratagem, not from fear, retreated. There was a gentle acclivity in\r\ntheir rear, between the army and their camp; and because they had\r\nsufficient numbers, they had left in the camp several strong cohorts,\r\narmed and ready for action, which were to rush forth, when the battle\r\nwas now commenced, and when the enemy had approached the rampart. The\r\nRoman being drawn into disadvantageous ground by following the\r\nretreating enemy in disorder, became exposed to this sally. Terror\r\ntherefore being turned on the victor, by reason of this new force, and\r\nthe declivity of the valley, caused the Roman line to give way. The\r\nVolscians, who made the attack from the camp, being fresh, press on\r\nthem; those also who had given way by a pretended flight, renew the\r\nfight. The Roman soldiers no longer recovered themselves; but unmindful\r\nof their recent presumption and former glory, were turning their backs\r\nin every direction, and with disorderly speed were making for their\r\ncamp, when Camillus, being mounted on his horse by those around him, and\r\nhastily opposing the reserved troops to them, \"Is this,\" says he,\r\n\"soldiers, the battle which ye called for? What man, what god is there,\r\nwhom ye can blame? That was your rashness, this your cowardice. Having\r\nfollowed another leader, now follow Camillus; and as ye are accustomed\r\nto do under my leadership, conquer. Why do ye look to the rampart and\r\ncamp? Not a man of you shall that camp receive, except as victor.\" Shame\r\nat first stopped their disorderly flight; then when they saw the\r\nstandards wheel about, and a line formed to meet the enemy, and the\r\ngeneral, besides being distinguished by so many triumphs, venerable also\r\nby his age, presented himself in front of the battalions, where the\r\ngreatest toil and danger was, every one began to upbraid both himself\r\nand others, and mutual exhortation with a brisk shout pervaded the\r\nentire line. Nor was the other tribune deficient on the occasion. Being\r\ndespatched to the cavalry by his colleague, who was restoring the line\r\nof the infantry, not by rebuking them, (for which task his share in\r\ntheir fault had rendered him an authority of little weight,) but from\r\ncommand turning entirely to entreaties, he besought them individually\r\nand collectively, \"to redeem him from blame, who was answerable for the\r\nevents of that day. Notwithstanding the repugnance and dissuasion of my\r\ncolleague, I gave myself a partner in the rashness of all rather than in\r\nthe prudence of one. Camillus sees his own glory in your fortune,\r\nwhatever it be; for my part, unless the battle is restored, I shall feel\r\nthe result with you all, the infamy alone (which is most distressing).\"\r\nIt was deemed best that the horse should be transferred into the line\r\nwhilst still unsteady, and that they should attack the enemy by fighting\r\non foot. Distinguished by their arms and courage, they proceed in\r\nwhatever direction they perceive the line of the infantry most pressed;\r\nnor among either the officers or soldiers is there any abatement\r\nobserved from the utmost effort of courage. The result therefore felt\r\nthe aid of the bravery exerted; and the Volscians being put to real\r\nflight in that direction in which they had lately retreated under\r\npretended fear, great numbers were slain both in the battle itself, and\r\nafterwards in flight; the others in the camp, which was taken in the\r\nsame onset: more, however, were captured than slain.\r\n\r\n25. Where when, on taking an account of the prisoners, several Tusculans\r\nwere recognised, being separated from the rest, they are brought to the\r\ntribunes; and they confessed to those who interrogated them, that they\r\nhad taken up arms by the authority of the state. By the fear of which\r\nwar so near home Camillus being alarmed, says that he would immediately\r\ncarry the prisoners to Rome, that the senate might not be ignorant, that\r\nthe Tusculans had revolted from the alliance; meanwhile his colleague,\r\nif he thought proper, should command the camp and army. One day had been\r\na lesson to him not to prefer his own counsels to better. However\r\nneither himself, nor any person in the army, supposed that Camillus\r\nwould pass over his misconduct without some angry feelings, by which the\r\ncommonwealth had been brought into so perilous a situation; and both in\r\nthe army and at Rome, the uniform account of all was, that, as matters\r\nhad been conducted with varying success among the Volscians, the blame\r\nof the unsuccessful battle and of the flight lay with Lucius Furius, all\r\nthe glory of the successful one was to be attributed to Camillus. The\r\nprisoners being brought into the senate, when the senate decreed that\r\nthe Tusculans should be punished with war, and they intrusted the\r\nmanagement of that war to Camillus, he requests one assistant for\r\nhimself in that business, and being allowed to select which ever of his\r\ncolleagues he pleased, contrary to the expectation of every one, he\r\nsolicited Lucius Furius. By which moderation of feeling he both\r\nalleviated the disgrace of his colleague, and acquired great glory to\r\nhimself. There was no war, however, with the Tusculans. By firm\r\nadherence to peace they warded off the Roman violence, which they could\r\nnot have done by arms. When the Romans entered their territories, no\r\nremovals were made from the places adjoining to the road, the\r\ncultivation of the lands was not interrupted: the gates of the city\r\nlying open, they came forth in crowds clad in their gowns to meet the\r\ngenerals; provision for the army was brought with alacrity from the city\r\nand the lands. Camillus having pitched his camp before the gates,\r\nwishing to know whether the same appearance of peace, which was\r\ndisplayed in the country, prevailed also within the walls, entered the\r\ncity, where he beheld the gates lying open, and every thing exposed to\r\nsale in the open shops, and the workmen engaged each on their respective\r\nemployments, and the schools of learning buzzing with the voices of the\r\nscholars, and the streets filled amid the different kinds of people,\r\nwith boys and women going different ways, whithersoever the occasions of\r\ntheir respective callings carried them; nothing in any quarter that bore\r\nany appearance of panic or even of surprise; he looked around at every\r\nobject, attentively inquiring where the war had been. No trace was there\r\nof any thing having been removed, or brought forward for the occasion;\r\nso completely was every thing in a state of steady tranquil peace, so\r\nthat it scarcely seemed that even the rumour of war could have reached\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n26. Overcome therefore by the submissive demeanour of the enemy, he\r\nordered their senate to be called. \"Tusculans,\" he says, \"ye are the\r\nonly persons who have yet found the true arms and the true strength, by\r\nwhich to protect your possessions from the resentment of the Romans.\r\nProceed to Rome to the senate. The fathers will consider, whether you\r\nhave merited more punishment for your former conduct, or forgiveness for\r\nyour present. I shall not anticipate your gratitude for a favour to be\r\nconferred by the state. From me ye shall have the power of seeking\r\npardon. The senate will grant to your entreaties such a result, as they\r\nshall consider meet.\" When the Tusculans came to Rome, and the senate\r\n[of a people], who were till a little before faithful allies, were seen\r\nwith sorrowful countenances in the porch of the senate-house, the\r\nfathers, immediately moved [at the sight,] even then ordered them to be\r\ncalled in rather in a friendly than a hostile manner. The Tusculan\r\ndictator spoke as follows: \"Conscript fathers, we against whom ye\r\nproclaimed and made war, just as you see us now standing in the porch of\r\nyour house, so armed and so attired did we go forth to meet your\r\ngenerals and your legions. This was our habit, this the habit of our\r\ncommons; and ever shall be, unless whenever we shall receive arms from\r\nyou and defence of you. We return thanks to your generals and your\r\ntroops for having trusted their eyes more than their ears; and for\r\nhaving committed nothing hostile, where none subsisted. The peace, which\r\nwe observed, the same we solicit at your hands: we pray you, avert war\r\nto that quarter where, if any where, it subsists. What your arms may be\r\nable to effect on us, if after our submission we are to experience it,\r\nwe will experience unarmed. This is our determination. May the immortal\r\ngods grant that it be as successful as it is dutiful! With respect to\r\nthe charges, by which you were induced to declare war against us, though\r\nit is needless to refute by words what has been contradicted by facts;\r\nyet, admitting they were true, we think it safe for us to confess them,\r\nafter having shown such evident marks of repentance. Admit then that we\r\nhave offended against you, since ye deserve that such satisfaction be\r\nmade to you.\" These were nearly the words used by the Tusculans. They\r\nobtained peace at the present, and not long after the freedom of the\r\nstate also. The legions were withdrawn from Tusculum.\r\n\r\n27. Camillus, distinguished by his prudence and bravery in the Volscian\r\nwar, by his success in the Tusculan expedition, in both by his\r\nextraordinary moderation and forbearance towards his colleague, went out\r\nof office; the military tribunes for the following year being Lucius and\r\nPublius Valerius, Lucius a fifth, Publius a third time, and Caius\r\nSergius a third time, Lucius Menenius a second time, Spurius Papirius,\r\nand Servius Cornelius Maluginensis. The year required censors also,\r\nchiefly on account of the uncertain representations regarding the debt;\r\nthe tribunes of the commons exaggerating the amount of it on account of\r\nthe odium of the thing, whilst it was underrated by those whose interest\r\nit was that the difficulty of procuring payment should appear to depend\r\nrather on [the want of] integrity, than of ability in the debtors. The\r\ncensors appointed were Caius Sulpicius Camerinus, Spurius Postumius\r\nRegillensis; and the matter having been commenced was interrupted by the\r\ndeath of Postumius, because it was not conformable to religion that a\r\nsubstitute should be colleague to a censor. Accordingly after Sulpicius\r\nhad resigned his office, other censors having been appointed under some\r\ndefect, they did not discharge the office; that a third set should be\r\nappointed was not allowed, as though the gods did not admit a censorship\r\nfor that year. The tribunes denied that such mockery of the commons was\r\nto be tolerated; \"that the senate were averse to the public tablets, the\r\nwitnesses of each man's property, because they were unwilling that the\r\namount of the debt should be seen, which would clearly show that one\r\npart of the state was depressed by the other; whilst in the mean time\r\nthe commons, oppressed with debt, were exposed to one enemy after\r\nanother. Wars were now sought out in every direction without\r\ndistinction. Troops were marched from Antium to Satricum, from Satricum\r\nto Velitræ, and thence to Tusculum. The Latins, Hernicians, and the\r\nPrænestines were now threatened with hostilities, more through a hatred\r\nof their fellow-citizens than of the enemy, in order to wear out the\r\ncommons under arms, and not suffer them to breathe in the city, or to\r\nreflect on their liberty at their leisure, or to stand in an assembly\r\nwhere they may hear a tribune's voice discussing concerning the\r\nreduction of interest and the termination of other grievances. But if\r\nthe commons had a spirit mindful of the liberty of their fathers, that\r\nthey would neither suffer any Roman citizen to be assigned to a creditor\r\non account of debt, nor a levy to be held; until, the debts being\r\nexamined, and some method adopted for lessening them, each man should\r\nknow what was his own, and what another's; whether his person was still\r\nfree to him, or that also was due to the stocks.\" The price held out for\r\nsedition soon raised it: for both several were made over to creditors,\r\nand on account of the rumour of the Prænestine war, the senate decreed\r\nthat new legions should be levied; both which measures began to be\r\nobstructed by tribunitian interposition and the combined efforts of the\r\ncommons. For neither the tribunes suffered those consigned to their\r\ncreditors to be thrown into prison, nor did the young men give in their\r\nnames. While the senate felt less pressing anxiety about enforcing the\r\nlaws regarding the lending of money than about the levy; for now it was\r\nannounced that the enemy, having marched from Præneste, had encamped in\r\nthe Gabinian territory; meanwhile this very report rather aroused the\r\ntribunes of the commons to the struggle commenced than deterred them;\r\nnor did any thing else suffice to allay the discontent in the city, but\r\nthe approach of hostilities to the very walls.\r\n\r\n28. For when the Prænestines had been informed that no army was levied\r\nat Rome, no general fixed on, that the senate and people were turned the\r\none against the other; their leaders thinking that an opportunity\r\npresented itself, making a hasty march, and laying waste the country as\r\nthey went along, they advanced their standards as far as the Colline\r\ngate. The panic in the city was great. The alarm was given to take up\r\narms; persons ran together to the walls and gates, and at length turning\r\nfrom sedition to war, they created Titus Quinctius Cincinnatus dictator.\r\nHe appointed Aulus Sempronius Atratinus his master of the horse. When\r\nthis was heard, (such was the terror of that office,) the enemy retired\r\nfrom the walls, and the young Romans assembled to the edict without\r\nrefusal. Whilst the army is being levied at Rome, in the mean time the\r\nenemy's camp is pitched not far from the river Allia: thence laying\r\nwaste the land far and wide, they boasted one to the other that they had\r\nchosen a place fatal to the Roman city; that there would be a similar\r\nconsternation and flight from thence as occurred in the Gallic war. For\r\n\"if the Romans dread a day deemed inauspicious, and marked with the name\r\nof that place, how much more than the Allian day would they dread the\r\nAllia itself, the monument of so great a disaster. No doubt the fierce\r\nlooks of the Gauls and the sound of their voices would recur to their\r\neyes and ears.\" Turning over in mind those groundless notions of\r\ncircumstances as groundless, they rested their hopes on the fortune of\r\nthe place. On the other hand, the Romans [considered] that, \"in whatever\r\nplace a Latin enemy stood, they knew full well that they were the same\r\nwhom, after having utterly defeated at the lake Regillus, they kept in\r\npeaceable subjection for one hundred years; that the place being\r\ndistinguished by the memory of their defeat, would rather stimulate them\r\nto blot out the remembrance of their disgrace, than raise a fear that\r\nany land should be unfavourable to their success. Were even the Gauls\r\nthemselves presented to them in that place, that they would fight just\r\nas they fought at Rome in recovering their country, as the day after at\r\nGabii; then, when they took care, that no enemy, who had entered the\r\nwalls of Rome, should carry home an account of their success or defeat.\"\r\n\r\n29. With these feelings on either side they came to the Allia. The Roman\r\ndictator, when the enemy were in view drawn up and ready for action,\r\nsays, \"Aulus Sempronius, do you see that these men have taken their\r\nstand at the Allia, relying on the fortune of the place? nor have the\r\nimmortal gods granted them any thing of surer confidence, or any more\r\neffectual support. But do you, relying on arms and on courage, make a\r\nbrisk charge on the middle of their line; I will bear down on them when\r\nthrown into disorder and consternation with the legions. Ye gods,\r\nwitnesses of the treaty, assist us, and exact the penalty, due for\r\nyourselves having been violated, and for us who have been deceived\r\nthrough the appeal made to your divinity.\" The Prænestines sustained not\r\nthe attack of cavalry, or infantry; their ranks were broken at the first\r\ncharge and shout. Then when their line maintained its ground in no\r\nquarter, they turn their backs; and being thrown into consternation and\r\ncarried beyond their own camp by their panic, they stop not from their\r\nprecipitate speed, until Præneste came in view. There, having been\r\ndispersed in consequence of their flight, they select a post for the\r\npurpose of fortifying it in a hasty manner; lest, if they betook\r\nthemselves within the walls, the country should be burned forthwith, and\r\nwhen all places should be desolated, siege should be laid to the city.\r\nBut when the victorious Romans approached, the camp at the Allia having\r\nbeen plundered, that fortress also was abandoned, and considering the\r\nwalls scarcely secure, they shut themselves up within the town of\r\nPræneste. There were eight towns besides under the sway of the\r\nPrænestines. Hostilities were carried round to these also; and these\r\nbeing taken one after the other without much difficulty, the army was\r\nled to Velitræ. This also was taken by storm. They then came to\r\nPræneste, the main source of the war. That town was obtained, not by\r\nforce, but by capitulation. Titus Quinctius, being once victorious in a\r\npitched battle, having taken also two camps belonging to the enemy, and\r\nnine towns by storm, and Præneste being obtained by surrender, returned\r\nto Rome: and in his triumph brought into the Capitol the statue of\r\nJupiter Imperator, which he had conveyed from Præneste. It was dedicated\r\nbetween the recesses of Jupiter and Minerva, and a tablet fixed under\r\nit, as a monument of his exploits, was engraved with nearly these words:\r\n\"Jupiter and all the gods granted, that Titus Quinctius, dictator,\r\nshould take nine towns.\" On the twentieth day after the appointment he\r\nabdicated the dictatorship.\r\n\r\n30. An election was then held of military tribunes with consular power;\r\nin which the number of patricians and plebeians was equal. From the\r\npatricians were elected Publius and Caius Manlius, with Lucius Julius;\r\nthe commons gave Caius Sextilius, Marcus Albinius, and Lucius Antistius.\r\nTo the Manlii, because they had the advantage of the plebeians in family\r\nstation, and of Julius in interest, the province of the Volscians was\r\nassigned out of the ordinary course, without lots, or mutual\r\narrangement; of which circumstance both themselves and the patricians\r\nwho conferred it afterwards repented. Without any previous reconnoitre\r\nthey sent out some cohorts to forage. It having been falsely reported\r\nto them that these were ensnared, whilst they march in great haste, in\r\norder to support them, without even retaining the author [of the report]\r\nwho had deceived them, he being a Latin enemy instead of a Roman\r\nsoldier, they themselves fell into an ambuscade. There, whilst they\r\nsuffer and commit great havoc, making resistance on disadvantageous\r\nground solely by the valour of the soldiers, the enemy in the mean time\r\nin another quarter attacked the Roman camp which was situate on a plain.\r\nBy their temerity and want of skill, matters were brought into jeopardy\r\nin both places by the generals. Whatever portion [of the army] was\r\nsaved, the good fortune of the Roman people, and the steady valour of\r\nthe soldiers, even without a director, protected. When an account of\r\nthese events was brought to Rome, it was at first agreeable to them that\r\na dictator should be appointed; then when intelligence was received from\r\nthe Volscian country that matters were quiet, and it appeared manifest\r\nthat they knew not how to take advantage of victory and of opportunity,\r\nthe army and generals were recalled from thence also; and there was\r\nquiet from that quarter, as far as regarded the Volscians. The only\r\ndisturbance there was towards the end of the year was, that the\r\nPrænestines, having stirred up some of the states of the Latins, renewed\r\nhostilities. During the same year new colonists were enrolled for Setia,\r\nthe colony itself complaining of the paucity of men. Domestic\r\ntranquillity, which the influence of the plebeian military tribunes and\r\nthe respect shown to them among their own party procured, was a\r\nconsolation for the want of success in war.\r\n\r\n31. The commencement of the following year blazed forth with violent\r\nsedition, the military tribunes with consular power being Spurius\r\nFurius, Quintus Servilius a second time, Caius Licinius, Publius\r\nClœlius, Marcus Horatius, Lucius Geganius. The debt was both the\r\nground-work and cause of the disturbance: for the purpose of\r\nascertaining which Spurius Servilius Priscus and Quintus Clœlius\r\nSiculus, being appointed censors, were prevented by war from proceeding\r\nin the business. For alarming news at first, then the flight [of the\r\ncountry people] from the lands, brought intelligence that the legions of\r\nthe Volscians had entered the borders, and were laying waste the Roman\r\nland in every direction. In which alarm, so far was the fear of the\r\nforeign enemy from putting a check to the domestic feuds, that on the\r\ncontrary the tribunitian power became even more vehement in obstructing\r\nthe levy; until these conditions were imposed on the patricians, that no\r\none was to pay tribute as long as the war lasted, nor issue any judicial\r\nprocess respecting money due. This relaxation being obtained for the\r\ncommons, there was no delay with respect to the levy. New legions being\r\nenlisted, it was resolved that two armies should be led into the\r\nVolscian territory, the legions being divided. Spurius Furius and Marcus\r\nHoratius proceed to the right, towards the sea-coast and Antium; Quintus\r\nServilius and Lucius Geganius to the left, to Ecetra towards the\r\nmountains. On neither side did the enemy meet them. Devastation was\r\ntherefore committed, not similar to that straggling kind which the\r\nVolscian had practised by snatches under the influence of trepidation\r\nafter the manner of a banditti, relying on the dissensions among the\r\nenemy and dreading their valour; but committed with the full meed of\r\ntheir resentment by a regular army, more severe also by reason of their\r\ncontinuance. For the incursions had been made by the Volscians on the\r\nskirts of the borders, as they were afraid lest an army might in the\r\nmean time come forth from Rome: the Romans, on the contrary, had a\r\nmotive for tarrying in the enemy's country, in order to entice them to\r\nan engagement. All the houses therefore on the lands, and some villages\r\nalso, being burnt down, not a fruit-tree nor the seed being left for the\r\nhope of a harvest, all the booty both of men and cattle, which was\r\noutside the walls, being driven off, the troops were led back from both\r\nquarters to Rome.\r\n\r\n32. A short interval having been granted to the debtors to recover\r\nbreath, when matters became perfectly quiet with respect to the enemy,\r\nlegal proceedings began to be instituted anew; and so remote was all\r\nhope of relieving the former debt, that a new one was now contracted by\r\na tax for building a wall of hewn stone bargained for by the censors: to\r\nwhich burden the commons were obliged to submit, because the tribunes of\r\nthe commons had no levy which they could obstruct. Forced by the\r\ninfluence of the nobles, they elected all the military tribunes from\r\namong the patricians, Lucius Æmilius, Publius Valerius a fourth time,\r\nCaius Veturius, Servius Sulpicius, Lucius and Caius Quinctius\r\nCincinnatus. By the same influence they succeeded in raising three\r\narmies against the Latins and Volscians, who with combined forces were\r\nencamped at Satricum, all the juniors being bound by the military oath\r\nwithout any opposition; one army for the protection of the city; the\r\nother to be sent for the sudden emergencies of war, if any disturbance\r\nshould arise elsewhere. The third, and by far the most powerful, Publius\r\nValerius and Lucius Æmilius led to Satricum. Where when they found the\r\nenemy's line of battle drawn up on level ground, they immediately\r\nengaged; and before the victory was sufficiently declared, the battle,\r\nwhich held out fair hopes of success, was put a stop to by rain\r\naccompanied by a violent storm of wind. On the following day the battle\r\nwas renewed; and for a considerable time the Latin troops particularly,\r\nwho had learned the Roman discipline during the long confederacy, stood\r\ntheir ground with equal bravery and success. A charge of cavalry broke\r\ntheir ranks; when thus confused, the infantry advanced upon them; and as\r\nmuch as the Roman line advanced, so much were the enemy dislodged from\r\ntheir ground; and when once the battle gave way, the Roman prowess\r\nbecame irresistible. When the enemy being routed made for Satricum,\r\nwhich was two miles distant, not for their camp, they were cut down\r\nchiefly by the cavalry; their camp was taken and plundered. The night\r\nsucceeding the battle, they betake themselves to Antium in a march\r\nresembling a flight; and though the Roman army followed them almost in\r\ntheir steps, fear however possessed more swiftness than anger. Wherefore\r\nthe enemy entered the walls before the Roman could annoy or impede their\r\nrear. After that several days were spent in laying waste the country, as\r\nthe Romans were neither supplied with military engines to attack walls,\r\nnor the others to hazard the chance of a battle.\r\n\r\n33. At this time a dissension arose between the Antians and the Latins;\r\nwhen the Antians, overcome by misfortunes and reduced by a war, in which\r\nthey had both been born and had grown old, began to think of a\r\nsurrender; whilst their recent revolt after a long peace, their spirits\r\nbeing still fresh, rendered the Latins more determined to persevere in\r\nthe war. There was an end to the contest, when it became evident to both\r\nparties that neither would stand in the way of the other so as to\r\nprevent them from following out their own views. The Latins by departing\r\nredeemed themselves from a share in what they deemed a dishonourable\r\npeace. The Antians, on the removal of those who by their presence\r\nimpeded their salutary counsels, surrender their city and lands to the\r\nRomans. The resentment and rage of the Latins, because they were neither\r\nable to damage the Romans in war, nor to retain the Volscians in arms,\r\nvented itself in setting fire to the city of Satricum, which had been\r\ntheir first place of retreat after their defeat; nor did any other\r\nbuilding in that city remain, since they cast firebrands\r\nindiscriminately into those sacred and profane, except the temple of\r\nMother Matuta. From that neither the sanctity of the building itself,\r\nnor respect for the gods, is said to have restrained them, but an awful\r\nvoice, emitted from the temple with threats of dismal vengeance, unless\r\nthey removed their abominable fires to a distance from the temples.\r\nFired with this rage, their impetuosity carried them on to Tusculum,\r\nunder the influence of resentment, because, having abandoned the general\r\nassociation of the Latins, they joined themselves not only in alliance\r\nwith the Romans, but also as members of their state. As they\r\nunexpectedly rushed in at the gates, which were lying open, the town,\r\nexcept the citadel, was taken at the first shout. The townsmen with\r\ntheir wives and children took refuge in the citadel, and sent messengers\r\nto Rome, to inform the senate of their situation. An army was led to\r\nTusculum with no less expedition than was worthy of the honour of the\r\nRoman people. Lucius Quinctius and Servius Sulpicius, military tribunes,\r\ncommanded it. They beheld the gates of Tusculum shut, and the Latins,\r\nwith the feelings of besiegers and besieged, on the one side defending\r\nthe walls of Tusculum, on the other hand attacking the citadel; they\r\nstruck terror and felt it at the same time. The arrival of the Romans\r\nproduced a change in the minds of both parties: it turned the Tusculans\r\nfrom great alarm into the utmost alacrity, and the Latins from almost\r\nassured confidence of soon taking the citadel, as they were masters of\r\nthe town, to very slender hope of even their own safety. A shout is\r\nraised by the Tusculans from the citadel; it is answered by a much\r\nlouder one from the Roman army. The Latins are hard pressed on both\r\nsides: they neither withstand the force of the Tusculans pouring down on\r\nthem from the higher ground; nor are they able to repel the Romans\r\nadvancing up to the walls, and forcing the bars of the gates. The walls\r\nwere first taken by scalade; the gates were then broken open; and when\r\nthe two enemies pressed them both in front and in the rear, nor did\r\nthere remain any strength for fight, nor any room for running away,\r\nbetween both they were all cut to pieces to a man. Tusculum being\r\nrecovered from the enemy, the army was led back to Rome.\r\n\r\n34. In proportion as all matters were more tranquil abroad in\r\nconsequence of their successes in war this year, so much did the\r\nviolence of the patricians and the distresses of the commons in the city\r\nincrease every day; as the ability to pay was prevented by the very fact\r\nthat it was necessary to pay. Accordingly, when nothing could now be\r\npaid out of their property, being cast in suits and assigned over to\r\ncustody, they satisfied their creditors by their character and persons,\r\nand punishment was substituted for payment. Wherefore not only the\r\nlowest, but even the leading men in the commons had sunk so low in\r\nspirit, that no enterprising and adventurous man had courage, not only\r\nto stand for the military tribuneship among the patricians, (for which\r\nprivilege they had strained all their energies,) but not even to take on\r\nthem and sue for plebeian magistracies: and the patricians seemed to\r\nhave for ever recovered the possession of an honour that had been only\r\nusurped by the commons for a few years. A trifling cause, as generally\r\nhappens, which had the effect of producing a mighty result, intervened\r\nto prevent the other party from exulting too much in that. Two daughters\r\nof Marcus Fabius Ambustus, an influential man, both among persons of his\r\nown station, and also with the commons, because he was by no means\r\nconsidered a despiser of persons of that order, had been married, the\r\nelder to Servius Sulpicius, the younger to Caius Licinius Stolo, a\r\ndistinguished person, but still a plebeian; and the fact of such an\r\nalliance not having been scorned, had gained influence for Fabius with\r\nthe people. It so happened, that when the two sisters, the Fabiæ, were\r\npassing away the time in conversation in the house of Servius Sulpicius,\r\nmilitary tribune, a lictor of Sulpicius, when he returned home from the\r\nforum, rapped at the door, as is usual, with the rod. When the younger\r\nFabia, a stranger to this custom, was frightened at it, she was laughed\r\nat by her sister, who was surprised at her sister not knowing the\r\nmatter. That laugh, however, gave a sting to the female mind, sensitive\r\nas it is to mere trifles. From the number of persons attending on her,\r\nand asking her commands, her sister's match, I suppose, appeared to her\r\nto be a fortunate one, and she repined at her own, according to that\r\nerroneous feeling, by which every one is most annoyed at being\r\noutstripped by those nearest to him. When her father happened to see her\r\ndisappointed after the recent mortification, by kindly inquiring he\r\nprevailed on her, who was dissembling the cause of her annoyance, (as\r\nbeing neither affectionate with respect to her sister, nor respectful\r\ntowards her husband,) to confess, that the cause of her chagrin was,\r\nthat she had been united to an inferior, and married into a house which\r\nneither honour nor influence could enter. Ambustus then, consoling his\r\ndaughter, bid her keep up good spirits; that she should soon see the\r\nsame honours at her own house, which she now sees at her sister's. Upon\r\nthis he began to draw up his plans with his son-in-law, having attached\r\nto himself Lucius Sextius, an enterprising young man, and one to whose\r\nhope nothing was wanting but patrician descent.\r\n\r\n35. There appeared a favourable opportunity for making innovations on\r\naccount of the immense load of debt, no alleviation of which evil the\r\ncommons could hope for unless their own party were placed in the highest\r\nauthority. To [bring about] that object [they saw] that they should\r\nexert themselves. That the plebeians, by endeavouring and persevering,\r\nhad already gained a step towards it, whence, if they struggled forward,\r\nthey might reach the summit, and be on a level with the patricians, in\r\nhonour as well as in merit. For the present it was resolved that\r\nplebeian tribunes should be created, in which office they might open for\r\nthemselves a way to other honours. And Caius Licinius and Lucius\r\nSextius, being elected tribunes, proposed laws all against the power of\r\nthe patricians, and for the interests of the commons: one regarding the\r\ndebt, that, whatever had been paid in interest being deducted from the\r\nprincipal, the remainder should be paid off in three years by equal\r\ninstalments; the other concerning the limitation of land, that no one\r\nshould possess more than five hundred acres of land; a third, that there\r\nshould be no election of military tribunes, and that one at least of the\r\nconsuls should be elected from the commons; all matters of great\r\nimportance, and such as could not be attained without the greatest\r\nstruggles. A contest therefore for all those objects, of which there is\r\never an inordinate desire among men, viz. land, money, and honours,\r\nbeing now proposed, the patricians became terrified and dismayed, and\r\nfinding no other remedy in their public and private consultations except\r\nthe protest, which had been tried in many previous contests, they gained\r\nover their colleagues to oppose the bills of the tribunes. When they saw\r\nthe tribes summoned by Licinius and Sextius to announce their votes,\r\nsurrounded by bands of patricians, they neither suffered the bills to be\r\nread, nor any other usual form for taking the votes of the commons to be\r\ngone through. And now assemblies being frequently convened to no\r\npurpose, when the propositions were now considered as rejected; \"It is\r\nvery well,\" says Sextius; \"since it is determined that a protest should\r\npossess so much power, by that same weapon will we protect the people.\r\nCome, patricians, proclaim an assembly for the election of military\r\ntribunes; I will take care that that word, I FORBID IT, which you listen\r\nto our colleagues chaunting with so much pleasure, shall not be very\r\ndelightful to you.\" Nor did the threats fall ineffectual: no elections\r\nwere held, except those of ædiles and plebeian tribunes. Licinius and\r\nSextius, being re-elected plebeian tribunes, suffered not any curule\r\nmagistrates to be appointed, and this total absence of magistrates\r\ncontinued in the city for the space of five years, the people\r\nre-electing the two tribunes, and these preventing the election of\r\nmilitary tribunes.\r\n\r\n36. There was an opportune cessation of other wars: the colonists of\r\nVelitræ, becoming wanton through ease, because there was no Roman army,\r\nmade repeated incursions on the Roman territory, and set about laying\r\nsiege to Tusculum. This circumstance, the Tusculans, old allies, new\r\nfellow-citizens, imploring aid, moved not only the patricians, but the\r\ncommons also, chiefly with a sense of honour. The tribunes of the\r\ncommons relaxing their opposition, the elections were held by the\r\ninterrex; and Lucius Furius, Aulus Manlius, Servius Sulpicius, Servius\r\nCornelius, Publius and Caius Valerius, found the commons by no means so\r\ncomplying in the levy as in the elections; and an army having been\r\nraised amid great contention, they set out, and not only dislodged the\r\nenemy from Tusculum, but shut them up even within their own walls.\r\nVelitræ began to be besieged by a much greater force than that with\r\nwhich Tusculum had been besieged; nor still could it be taken by those\r\nby whom the siege had been commenced. The new military tribunes were\r\nelected first: Quintius Servilius, Caius Veturius, Aulus and Marcus\r\nCornelius, Quintus Quinctius, Marcus Fabius. Nothing worthy of mention\r\nwas performed even by these at Velitræ. Matters were involved in greater\r\nperil at home: for besides Sextius and Licinius, the proposers of the\r\nlaws, re-elected tribunes of the commons now for the eighth time, Fabius\r\nalso, military tribune, father-in-law of Stolo, avowed himself the\r\nunhesitating supporter of those laws of which he had been the adviser.\r\nAnd whereas, there had been at first eight of the college of the\r\nplebeian tribunes protesters against the laws, there were now only five:\r\nand (as is usual with men who leave their own party) dismayed and\r\nastounded, they in words borrowed from others, urged as a reason for\r\ntheir protest, that which had been taught them at home; \"that a great\r\nnumber of the commons were absent with the army at Velitræ; that the\r\nassembly ought to be deferred till the coming of the soldiers, that the\r\nentire body of the commons might give their vote concerning their own\r\ninterests.\" Sextius and Licinius with some of their colleagues, and\r\nFabius one of the military tribunes, well-versed now by an experience of\r\nmany years in managing the minds of the commons, having brought forward\r\nthe leading men of the patricians, teased them by interrogating them on\r\neach of the subjects which were about to be brought before the people:\r\n\"would they dare to demand, that when two acres of land a head were\r\ndistributed among the plebeians, they themselves should be allowed to\r\nhave more than five hundred acres? that a single man should possess the\r\nshare of nearly three hundred citizens; whilst his portion of land\r\nscarcely extended for the plebeian to a stinted habitation and a place\r\nof burial? Was it their wish that the commons, surrounded with usury,\r\nshould surrender their persons to the stocks and to punishment, rather\r\nthan pay off their debt by [discharging] the principal; and that persons\r\nshould be daily led off from the forum in flocks, after being assigned\r\nto their creditors, and that the houses of the nobility should be filled\r\nwith prisoners? and that wherever a patrician dwelt, there should be a\r\nprivate prison?\"\r\n\r\n37. When they had uttered these statements, exasperating and pitiable\r\nin the recital, before persons alarmed for themselves, exciting greater\r\nindignation in the hearers than was felt by themselves, they affirmed\r\n\"that there never would be any other limit to their occupying the lands,\r\nor to their butchering the commons by usury, unless the commons were to\r\nelect one consul from among the plebeians, as a guardian of their\r\nliberty. That the tribunes of the commons were now despised, as being an\r\noffice which breaks down its own power by the privilege of protest. That\r\nthere could be no equality of right, where the dominion was in the hands\r\nof the one party, assistance only in that of the other. Unless the\r\nauthority were shared, the commons would never enjoy an equal share in\r\nthe commonwealth; nor was there any reason why any one should think it\r\nenough that plebeians were taken into account at the consular elections;\r\nunless it were made indispensable that one consul at least should be\r\nfrom the commons, no one would be elected. Or had they already\r\nforgotten, that when it had been determined that military tribunes\r\nshould be elected rather than consuls, for this reason, that the highest\r\nhonours should be opened to plebeians also, no one out of the commons\r\nwas elected military tribune for forty-four years? How could they\r\nsuppose, that they would voluntarily confer, when there are but two\r\nplaces, a share of the honour on the commons, who at the election of\r\nmilitary tribunes used to monopolize the eight places? and that they\r\nwould suffer a way to be opened to the consulship, who kept the\r\ntribuneship so long a time fenced up? That they must obtain by a law,\r\nwhat could not be obtained by influence at elections; and that one\r\nconsulate must be set apart out of the way of contest, to which the\r\ncommons may have access; since when left open to dispute it is sure ever\r\nto become the prize of the more powerful. Nor can that now be alleged,\r\nwhich they used formerly to boast of, that there were not among the\r\nplebeians qualified persons for curule magistracies. For, was the\r\ngovernment conducted with less activity and less vigour, since the\r\ntribunate of Publius Licinius Calvus, who was the first plebeian elected\r\nto that office, than it was conducted during those years when no one but\r\npatricians was a military tribune? Nay, on the contrary, several\r\npatricians had been condemned after their tribuneship, no plebeian.\r\nQuæstors also, as military tribunes, began to be elected from the\r\ncommons a few years before; nor had the Roman people been dissatisfied\r\nwith any one of them. The consulate still remained for the attainment of\r\nthe plebeians; that it was the bulwark, the prop of their liberty. If\r\nthey should attain that, then that the Roman people would consider that\r\nkings were really expelled from the city, and their liberty firmly\r\nestablished. For from that day that every thing in which the patricians\r\nsurpassed them, would flow in on the commons, power and honour, military\r\nglory, birth, nobility, valuable at present for their own enjoyment,\r\nsure to be left still more valuable to their children.\" When they saw\r\nsuch discourses favourably listened to, they publish a new proposition;\r\nthat instead of two commissioners for performing religious rites, ten\r\nshould be appointed; so that one half should be elected out of the\r\ncommons, the other half from the patricians; and they deferred the\r\nmeeting [for the discussion] of all those propositions, till the coming\r\nof that army which was besieging Velitræ.\r\n\r\n38. The year was completed before the legions were brought back from\r\nVelitræ. Thus the question regarding the laws was suspended and deferred\r\nfor the new military tribunes; for the commons re-elected the same two\r\nplebeian tribunes, because they were the proposers of the laws. Titus\r\nQuinctius, Servius Cornelius, Servius Sulpicius, Spurius Servilius,\r\nLucius Papirius, Lucius Valerius, were elected military tribunes.\r\nImmediately at the commencement of the year the question about the laws\r\nwas pushed to the extreme of contention; and when the tribes were\r\ncalled, nor did the protest of their colleagues prevent the proposers of\r\nthe laws, the patricians being alarmed have recourse to their two last\r\naids, to the highest authority and the highest citizen. It is resolved\r\nthat a dictator be appointed: Marcus Furius Camillus is appointed, who\r\nnominates Lucius Æmilius his master of the horse. To meet so powerful a\r\nmeasure of their opponents, the proposers of the laws also set forth the\r\npeople's cause with great determination of mind, and having convened an\r\nassembly of the people, they summon the tribes to vote. When the\r\ndictator took his seat, accompanied by a band of patricians, full of\r\nanger and of threats, and the business was going on at first with the\r\nusual contention of the plebeian tribunes, some proposing the law and\r\nothers protesting against it, and though the protest was more powerful\r\nby right, still it was overpowered by the popularity of the laws\r\nthemselves and of their proposers, and when the first tribes pronounced,\r\n\"Be it as you propose,\" then Camillus says, \"Since, Romans, tribunitian\r\nextravagance, not authority, sways you now, and ye are rendering the\r\nright of protest, acquired formerly by a secession of the commons,\r\ntotally unavailing by the same violent conduct by which you acquired it,\r\nI, as dictator, will support the right of protest, not more for the\r\ninterest of the whole commonwealth than for your sake; and by my\r\nauthority I will defend your rights of protection, which have been\r\noverturned. Wherefore if Caius Licinius and Lucius Sextius give way to\r\nthe protest of their colleagues, I shall not introduce a patrician\r\nmagistrate into an assembly of the commons. If, in opposition to the\r\nright of protest, they will strive to saddle laws on the state as though\r\ncaptive, I will not suffer the tribunitian power to be destroyed by\r\nitself.\" When the plebeian tribunes still persisted in the matter with\r\nunabated energy and contemptuously, Camillus, being highly provoked,\r\nsent his lictors to disperse the commons; and added threats, that if\r\nthey persisted he would bind down the younger men by the military oath,\r\nand would forthwith lead an army out of the city. He struck great terror\r\ninto the people; by the opposition he rather inflamed than lessened the\r\nspirits of their leaders. But the matter inclining neither way, he\r\nabdicated his dictatorship, either because he had been appointed with\r\nsome informality, as some have stated; or because the tribunes of the\r\npeople proposed to the commons, and the commons passed it, that if\r\nMarcus Furius did any thing as dictator, he should be fined five hundred\r\nthousand _asses_. But both the disposition of the man himself, and the\r\nfact that Publius Manlius was immediately substituted as dictator for\r\nhim, incline me to believe, that he was deterred rather by some defect\r\nin the auspices than by this unprecedented order. What could be the use\r\nof appointing him (Manlius) to manage a contest in which Camillus had\r\nbeen defeated? and because the following year had the same Marcus Furius\r\ndictator, who certainly would not without shame have resumed an\r\nauthority which but the year before had been worsted in his hands; at\r\nthe same time, because at the time when the motion about fining him is\r\nsaid to have been published, he could either resist this order, by which\r\nhe saw himself degraded, or he could not have obstructed those others\r\non account of which this was introduced, and throughout the whole series\r\nof disputes regarding the tribunitian and consular authority, even down\r\nto our own memory, the pre-eminence of the dictatorship was always\r\ndecided.\r\n\r\n39. Between the abdication of the former dictatorship and the new one\r\nentered on by Manlius, an assembly of the commons being held by the\r\ntribunes, as if it were an interregnum, it became evident which of the\r\nlaws proposed were more grateful to the commons, which to the proposers.\r\nFor they passed the bills regarding the interest and the land, rejected\r\nthe one regarding the plebeian consulate. And both decisions would have\r\nbeen carried into effect, had not the tribunes declared that they\r\nconsulted the people on all the laws collectively. Publius Manlius,\r\ndictator, then inclined the advantage to the side of the people, by\r\nnaming Caius Licinius from the commons, who had been military tribune,\r\nas master of the horse. The patricians, I understand, were much\r\ndispleased at this nomination, but the dictator used to excuse himself\r\nto the senate, alleging the near relationship between him and Licinius;\r\nat the same time denying that the authority of master of the horse was\r\nhigher than that of consular tribune. When the elections for the\r\nappointment of plebeian tribunes were declared, Licinius and Sextius so\r\nconducted themselves, that by denying that they any longer desired a\r\ncontinuation of the honour, they most powerfully stimulated the commons\r\nto effectuate that which they were anxious for notwithstanding their\r\ndissimulation. \"That they were now standing the ninth year as it were in\r\nbattle-array against the patricians, with the greatest danger to their\r\nprivate interests, without any benefit to the public. That the measures\r\npublished, and the entire strength of the tribunitian authority, had\r\ngrown old with them; the attack was made on their propositions, first by\r\nthe protest of their colleagues, then by banishing their youth to the\r\nwar at Velitræ; at length the dictatorial thunder was levelled against\r\nthem. That now neither colleagues, nor war, nor dictator stood in their\r\nway; as being a man, who by nominating a plebeian as master of the\r\nhorse, has even given an omen for a plebeian consul. That the commons\r\nretarded themselves and their interests. They could, if they liked, have\r\nthe city and forum free from creditors, their lands immediately free\r\nfrom unjust possessors. Which kindnesses, when would they ever estimate\r\nthem with sufficiently grateful feelings, if, whilst receiving the\r\nmeasures respecting their own interests, they cut away from the authors\r\nof them all hopes of distinction? That it was not becoming the modesty\r\nof the Roman people to require that they themselves be eased from usury,\r\nand be put in possession of the land unjustly occupied by the great,\r\nwhilst they leave those persons through whom they attained these\r\nadvantages, become old tribunitians, not only without honour, but even\r\nwithout the hope of honour. Wherefore they should first determine in\r\ntheir minds what choice they would make, then declare that choice at the\r\ntribunitian elections. If they wished that the measures published by\r\nthem should be passed collectively, there was some reason for\r\nre-electing the same tribunes; for they would carry into effect what\r\nthey published. But if they wished that only to be entertained which may\r\nbe necessary for each in private, there was no occasion for the\r\ninvidious continuation of honour; that they would neither have the\r\ntribuneship, nor the people those matters which were proposed.\"\r\n\r\n40. In reply to such peremptory language of the tribunes, when amazement\r\nat the insolence of their conduct and silence struck all the rest of the\r\npatricians motionless, Appius Claudius Crassus, the grandson of the\r\ndecemvir, is said to have stepped forward to refute their arguments,\r\n[urged on] more by hatred and anger than by hope [of succeeding], and to\r\nhave spoken nearly to this effect: \"Romans, to me it would be neither\r\nnew nor surprising, if I too on the present occasion were to hear that\r\none charge, which has ever been advanced against our family by turbulent\r\ntribunes, that even from the beginning nothing in the state has been of\r\nmore importance to the Claudian family than the dignity of the\r\npatricians; that they have ever resisted the interests of the commons.\r\nOf which charges I neither deny nor object to the one, that we, since we\r\nhave been admitted into the state and the patricians, have strenuously\r\ndone our utmost, that the dignity of those families, among which ye were\r\npleased that we should be, might be truly said rather to have been\r\nincreased than diminished. With respect to the other, in my own defence\r\nand that of my ancestors, I would venture to maintain, Romans, (unless\r\nany one may consider those things, which may be done for the general\r\ngood of the state, were injurious to the commons as if inhabitants of\r\nanother city,) that we, neither in our private nor in our official\r\ncapacity, ever knowingly did any thing which was intended to be\r\ndetrimental to the commons; and that no act nor word of ours can be\r\nmentioned with truth contrary to your interest (though some may have\r\nbeen contrary to your inclinations). Even though I were not of the\r\nClaudian family, nor descended from patrician blood, but an ordinary\r\nindividual of the Roman citizens, who merely felt that I was descended\r\nfrom free-born parents, and that I lived in a free state, could I be\r\nsilent on this matter: that Lucius Sextius and Caius Licinius, perpetual\r\ntribunes, forsooth, have assumed such a stock of arrogance during the\r\nnine years in which they have reigned, as to refuse to allow you the\r\nfree exercise of your suffrage either at the elections or in enacting\r\nlaws. On a certain condition, one of them says, ye shall re-elect us\r\ntribunes for the tenth time. What else is it, but saying, what others\r\nsue for, we disdain so thoroughly, that without some consideration we\r\nwill not accept it? But in the name of goodness, what is that\r\nconsideration, for which we may always have you tribunes of the commons?\r\nthat ye admit collectively all our measures, whether they please or\r\ndisplease, are profitable or unprofitable. I beg you, Tarquinii,\r\ntribunes of the commons, suppose that I, an individual citizen, should\r\ncall out in reply from the middle of the assembly, With your good leave\r\nbe it permitted us to select out of these measures those which we deem\r\nto be beneficial to us; to reject the others. It will not be permitted,\r\nhe says. Must you enact concerning the interest of money and the lands,\r\nthat which tends to the interest of you all; and must not this prodigy\r\ntake place in the city of Rome, that of seeing Lucius Sextius and this\r\nCaius Licinius consuls, a thing which you loathe and abominate? Either\r\nadmit all; or I propose none. Just as if any one were to place poison\r\nand food together before any one who was oppressed with famine, and\r\norder him either to abstain from that which would sustain life, or to\r\nmix with it that which would cause death. Wherefore, if this state were\r\nfree, would they not all in full assembly have replied to you, Begone\r\nhence with your tribuneships and your propositions? What? if you will\r\nnot propose that which it is the interest of the people to accept, will\r\nthere be no one who will propose it? If any patrician, if (what they\r\ndesire to be still more invidious) any Claudius should say, Either\r\naccept all, or I propose nothing; which of you, Romans, would bear it?\r\nWill ye never look at facts rather than persons? but always listen with\r\npartial ears to every thing which that officer will say, and with\r\nprejudiced ears to what may be said by any of us? But, by Jove, their\r\nlanguage is by no means becoming members of a republic. What! what sort\r\nis the measure, which they are indignant at its having been rejected by\r\nyou? very like their language, Romans. I ask, he says, that it may not\r\nbe lawful for you to elect, as consuls, such persons as ye may wish.\r\nDoes he require any thing else, who orders that one consul at least be\r\nelected from the commons; nor does he grant you the power of electing\r\ntwo patricians? If there were wars at the present day, such as the\r\nEtrurian for instance, when Porsenna took the Janiculum, such as the\r\nGallic war lately, when, except the Capitol and citadel, all these\r\nplaces were in possession of the enemy; and should Lucius Sextius stand\r\ncandidate for the consulate with Marcus Furius or any other of the\r\npatricians: could ye endure that Sextius should be consul without any\r\nrisk; that Camillus should run the risk of a repulse? Is this allowing a\r\ncommunity of honours, that it should be lawful that two plebeians, and\r\nnot lawful that two patricians, be made consuls, and that it should be\r\nnecessary that one be elected from among the commons, and lawful to pass\r\nby both of the patricians? what fellowship, what confederacy is that? Is\r\nit not sufficient, if you come in for a share of that in which you had\r\nno share hitherto, unless whilst suing for a part you seize on the\r\nwhole? I fear, he says, lest, if it be lawful that two patricians are to\r\nbe elected, ye will elect no plebeian. What else is this but saying,\r\nBecause ye will not of your own choice elect unworthy persons, I will\r\nimpose on you the necessity of electing persons whom you do not wish?\r\nWhat follows, but that if one plebeian stand candidate with two\r\npatricians, he owes no obligation to the people, and may say that he was\r\nappointed by the law, not by suffrages?\r\n\r\n41. \"How they may extort, not how they may sue for honours, is what they\r\nseek: and they are anxious to attain the highest honour, so that they\r\nmay not owe the obligations incurred even for the lowest; and they\r\nprefer to sue for honours rather through favourable conjunctures than\r\nby merit. Is there any one who can feel it an affront to have himself\r\ninspected and estimated; who thinks it reasonable that to himself alone,\r\namidst struggling competitors, honours should be certain? who would\r\nwithdraw himself from your judgment? who would make your suffrages\r\nnecessary instead of voluntary; servile instead of free? I omit mention\r\nof Licinius and Sextius, whose years of perpetuated power ye number, as\r\nthat of the kings in the Capitol; who is there this day in the state so\r\nmean, to whom the road to the consulate is not rendered easier through\r\nthe advantages of that law, than to us and to our children? inasmuch as\r\nyou will sometimes not be able to elect us even though you may wish it;\r\nthose persons you must elect, even though you were unwilling. Of the\r\ninsult offered to merit enough has been said (for merit appertains to\r\nhuman beings); what shall I say respecting religion and the auspices,\r\nwhich is contempt and injustice relating exclusively to the immortal\r\ngods? Who is there who does not know that this city was built by\r\nauspices, that all things are conducted by auspices during war and\r\npeace, at home and abroad? In whom therefore are the auspices vested\r\naccording to the usage of our forefathers? In the patricians, no doubt;\r\nfor no plebeian magistrate is ever elected by auspices. So peculiar to\r\nus are the auspices, that not only do the people elect in no other\r\nmanner, save by auspices, the patrician magistrates whom they do elect,\r\nbut even we ourselves, without the suffrages of the people, appoint the\r\ninterrex by auspices, and in our private station we hold those auspices,\r\nwhich they do not hold even in office. What else then does he do, than\r\nabolish auspices out of the state, who, by creating plebeian consuls,\r\ntakes them away from the patricians who alone can hold them? They may\r\nnow mock at religion. For what else is it, if the chickens do not feed?\r\nif they come out too slowly from the coop? if a bird chaunt an\r\nunfavourable note? These are trifling: but by not despising these\r\ntrifling matters, our ancestors have raised this state to the highest\r\neminence. Now, as if we had no need of the favour of the gods, we\r\nviolate all religious ceremonies. Wherefore let pontiffs, augurs, kings\r\nof the sacrifices be appointed at random. Let us place the tiara of\r\nJupiter's flamen on any person, provided he be a man. Let us hand over\r\nthe ancilia, the shrines, the gods, and the charge of the worship of the\r\ngods, to those to whom it is impious to commit them. Let not laws be\r\nenacted, nor magistrates elected under auspices. Let not the senate give\r\ntheir approbation, either to the assemblies of the centuries or of the\r\nCuriæ. Let Sextius and Licinius, like Romulus and Tatius, reign in the\r\ncity of Rome, because they give away as donations other persons' money\r\nand lands. So great is the charm of plundering the possessions of other\r\npersons: nor does it occur to you that by the one law vast wilds are\r\nproduced throughout the lands by expelling the proprietors from their\r\nterritories; by the other credit is destroyed, along with which all\r\nhuman society ceases to exist. For every reason, I consider that those\r\npropositions ought to be rejected by you. Whatever ye may do, I pray the\r\ngods to render it successful.\"\r\n\r\n42. The speech of Appius merely had this effect, that the time for\r\npassing the propositions was deferred. The same tribunes, Sextius and\r\nLicinius, being re-elected for the tenth time, succeeded in passing a\r\nlaw, that of the decemvirs for religious matters, one half should be\r\nelected from the commons. Five patricians were elected, and five out of\r\nthe plebeians; and by that step the way appeared opened to the\r\nconsulship. The commons, content with this victory, yielded to the\r\npatricians, that, all mention of consuls being omitted for the present,\r\nmilitary tribunes should be elected. Those elected were, Aulus and\r\nMarcus Cornelius a second time, Marcus Geganius, Publius Manlius, Lucius\r\nVeturius, and Publius Valerius a sixth time. When, except the siege of\r\nVelitræ, a matter rather of a slow than dubious result, there was no\r\ndisquiet from foreign concerns among the Romans; the sudden rumour of a\r\nGallic war being brought, influenced the state to appoint Marcus Furius\r\ndictator for the fifth time. He named Titus Quinctius Pennus master of\r\nthe horse. Claudius asserts that a battle was fought that year with the\r\nGauls, on the banks of the Anio; and that then the famous battle was\r\nfought on the bridge, in which Titus Manlius, engaging with a Gaul by\r\nwhom he had been challenged, slew him in the sight of the two armies and\r\ndespoiled him of his chain. But I am induced by the authority of several\r\nwriters to believe that those things happened not less than ten years\r\nlater; but that in this year a pitched battle was fought with the Gauls\r\nby the dictator, Marcus Furius, in the territory of Alba. The victory\r\nwas neither doubtful nor difficult to the Romans, though from the\r\nrecollection of the former defeat the Gauls had diffused great terror.\r\nMany thousands of the barbarians were slain in the field, and great\r\nnumbers in the storming of the camp. The rest dispersing, making chiefly\r\nfor Apulia, saved themselves from the enemy, both by continuing their\r\nflight to a great distance, as also because panic and terror had\r\nscattered them very widely. A triumph was decreed to the dictator with\r\nthe concurrence of the senate and commons. Scarcely had he as yet\r\nfinished the war, when a more violent disturbance awaited him at home;\r\nand by great struggles the dictator and the senate were overpowered, so\r\nthat the measures of the tribunes were admitted; and the elections of\r\nthe consuls were held in spite of the resistance of the nobility, at\r\nwhich Lucius Sextius was made consul, the first of plebeian rank. And\r\nnot even was that an end of the contests. Because the patricians refused\r\nto give their approbation, the affair came very near a secession of the\r\npeople, and other terrible threats of civil contests: when, however, the\r\ndissensions were accommodated on certain terms through the interference\r\nof the dictator; and concessions to the commons were made by the\r\nnobility regarding the plebeian consul; by the commons to the nobility,\r\nwith respect to one prætor to be elected out of the patricians, to\r\nadminister justice in the city. The different orders being at length\r\nrestored to concord after their long-continued animosity, when the\r\nsenate were of opinion that for the sake of the immortal gods they would\r\nreadily do a thing deserving, and that justly, if ever on any occasion\r\nbefore, that the most magnificent games should be performed, and that\r\none day should be added to the three; the plebeian ædiles refusing the\r\noffice, the young patricians cried out with one accord, that they, for\r\nthe purpose of paying honour to the immortal gods, would readily\r\nundertake the task, so that they were appointed ædiles. And when thanks\r\nwere returned to them by all, a decree of the senate passed, that the\r\ndictator should ask of the people two persons as ædiles from among the\r\npatricians; that the senate should give their approbation to all the\r\nelections of that year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Two magistrates were added, the prætorship and curule ædileship.

This year will be remarkable for the consulship of a man of mean\r\nbirth, remarkable for two new magistracies, the prætorship and curule\r\nædileship. These honours the patricians claimed to themselves, in\r\nconsideration of one consulship having been conceded to the plebeians.\r\nThe commons gave the consulship to Lucius Sextius, by whose law it had\r\nbeen obtained. The patricians by their popular influence obtained the\r\nprætorship for Spurius Furius Camillus, the son of Marcus, the ædileship\r\nfor Cneius Quinctius Capitolinus and Publius Cornelius Scipio, men of\r\ntheir own rank. To Lucius Sextius, the patrician colleague assigned was\r\nLucius Æmilius Mamercinus. In the beginning of the year mention was made\r\nboth of the Gauls, who, after having strayed about through Apulia, it\r\nwas now rumoured were forming into a body; and also concerning a revolt\r\nof the Hernicians. When all business was purposely deferred, so that\r\nnothing should be transacted through means of the plebeian consul,\r\nsilence was observed on all matters, and a state of inaction like to a\r\njustitium; except that, the tribunes not suffering it to pass unnoticed\r\nthat the nobility had arrogated to themselves three patrician\r\nmagistracies as a compensation for one plebeian consul, sitting in\r\ncurule chairs, clad in the prætexta like consuls; the prætor, too,\r\nadministering justice, and as if colleague to the consuls, and elected\r\nunder the same auspices, the senate were in consequence made ashamed to\r\norder the curule ædiles to be elected from among the patricians. It was\r\nat first agreed, that they should be elected from the commons every\r\nsecond year: afterwards the matter was left open. Then, in the consulate\r\nof Lucius Genucius and Quintus Servilius, affairs being tranquil both at\r\nhome and abroad, that they might at no period be exempt from fear and\r\ndanger, a great pestilence arose. They say that a prætor, a curule\r\nædile, and three plebeian tribunes died of it, and that several other\r\ndeaths took place in proportion among the populace; and that pestilence\r\nwas made memorable chiefly by the death of Marcus Furius, which, though\r\noccurring at an advanced age, was still much lamented. For he was a\r\ntruly extraordinary man under every change of fortune; the first man in\r\nthe state in peace and war, before he went into exile; still more\r\nillustrious in exile, whether by the regret felt for him by the state,\r\nwhich, when in captivity, implored his aid when absent; or by the\r\nsuccess with which, when restored to his country, he restored that\r\ncountry along with himself. For five and twenty years afterwards (for so\r\nmany years afterwards did he live) he uniformly preserved his claims to\r\nsuch great glory, and was deemed deserving of their considering him,\r\nnext after Romulus, a second founder of the city of Rome.\r\n\r\n2. The pestilence continued both for this and the following year, Caius\r\nSulpicius Peticus and Caius Licinius Stolo being consuls. During that\r\nyear nothing worth recording took place, except that for the purpose of\r\nimploring the favour of the gods, there was a Lectisternium, the third\r\ntime since the building of the city. And when the violence of the\r\ndisease was alleviated neither by human measures nor by divine\r\ninterference, their minds being broken down by superstition, among\r\nother means of appeasing the wrath of heaven, scenic plays also are said\r\nto have been instituted, a new thing to a warlike people (for hitherto\r\nthere had been only the shows of the circus). But the matter was\r\ntrivial, (as all beginnings generally are,) and even that itself from a\r\nforeign source. Without any poetry, or gesticulating in imitation of\r\nsuch poetry, actors were sent for from Etruria, dancing to the measures\r\nof a musician, and exhibited, according to the Tuscan fashion, movements\r\nby no means ungraceful. The young men afterwards began to imitate these,\r\nthrowing out at the same time among each other jocular expressions in\r\nuncouth verses; nor were their gestures irrelevant to their language.\r\nWherefore the matter was received with approbation, and by frequent use\r\nwas much improved. To the native performers the name of _histriones_ was\r\ngiven, because _hister_, in the Tuscan vocabulary, was the name of an\r\nactor, who did not, as formerly, throw out alternately artless and\r\nunpolished verses like the Fescennine at random, but represented medleys\r\ncomplete with metre, the music being regularly adjusted for the\r\nmusician, and with appropriate gesticulation. Livius, who several years\r\nafter, giving up medleys, was the first who ventured to digest a story\r\nwith a regular plot, (the same being, forsooth, as all were at that\r\ntime, the actor of his own pieces,) after having broken his voice from\r\nhaving been too repeatedly called on, and after having sought\r\npermission, is said to have placed a boy before the musician to chaunt,\r\nand to have performed the gesticulations with considerably freer\r\nmovement, because the employment of his voice was no impediment to him.\r\nThence commenced the practice of chaunting to the actors according to\r\ntheir manual gesticulations, and the dialogues only were left to their\r\nvoice. When by this arrangement the business of the scenic performances\r\nwas called away from laughter and intemperate mirth, and the amusement\r\nbecame gradually converted into an art, the young men, leaving to\r\nregular actors the performance of plays, began themselves, according to\r\nthe ancient usage, to throw out ludicrous jests comprised in verses,\r\nwhich from that time were called _exodia_, and were collected chiefly\r\nfrom the Atellan farces. Which kind of amusement, received from the\r\nOsci, the young kept to themselves, nor did they suffer it to be debased\r\nby regular players. Hence it remains an established usage that the\r\nactors of the Atellan farces are neither degraded from their tribe, and\r\nmay serve in the army, as if having no connexion with the profession of\r\nthe stage. Among the trifling beginnings of other matters, it seemed to\r\nme that the first origin of plays also should be noticed; that it might\r\nappear how from a moderate commencement it has reached its present\r\nextravagance, scarcely to be supported by opulent kingdoms.\r\n\r\n3. However, the first introduction of plays, intended as a religious\r\nexpiation, neither relieved their minds from religious awe, nor their\r\nbodies from disease. Nay more, when the circus being inundated by the\r\noverflowing of the Tiber happened to interrupt the middle of the\r\nperformance, that indeed, as if the gods were now turned from them, and\r\ndespised their efforts to soothe their wrath, excited great terror.\r\nAccordingly, Cneius Genucius and Lucius Æmilius Mamercinus being a\r\nsecond time consuls, when the searching for expiations harassed their\r\nminds, more than the diseases did their bodies, it is said to have been\r\ncollected from the memory of the more aged, that a pestilence had\r\nformerly been relieved, on the nail being driven by a dictator. Induced\r\nby this superstitious circumstance, the senate ordered a dictator to be\r\nappointed for the purpose of driving the nail. Lucius Manlius Imperiosus\r\nbeing appointed, named Lucius Pinarius master of the horse. There is an\r\nancient law written in antique letters and words, that whoever is\r\nsupreme officer should drive a nail on the ides of September. It was\r\ndriven into the right side of the temple of Jupiter supremely good and\r\ngreat, on that part where the temple of Minerva is. They say that the\r\nnail was a mark of the number of years elapsed, because letters were\r\nrare in those times, and that the law was referred to the temple of\r\nMinerva, because number is the invention of that goddess. Cincius, a\r\ncareful writer on such monuments, asserts that there were seen at\r\nVolsinii also nails fixed in the temple of Nortia, a Tuscan goddess, as\r\nindices of the number of years. Marcus Horatius, being consul, according\r\nto law dedicated the temple of Jupiter the best and greatest the year\r\nafter the expulsion of kings; the solemnity of fixing the nail was\r\nafterwards transferred from the consuls to the dictators, because theirs\r\nwas a superior office. The custom being afterwards dropped, it seemed a\r\nmatter of sufficient importance in itself, on account of which a\r\ndictator should be appointed. For which reason Lucius Manlius being\r\nappointed, just as if he had been appointed for the purpose of managing\r\nthe business of the state in general, and not to acquit it of a\r\nreligious obligation, being ambitious to manage the Hernician war,\r\nharassed the youth by a severe levy, and at length, all the plebeian\r\ntribunes having risen up against him, whether overcome by force or\r\nshame, he resigned the dictatorship.\r\n\r\n4. Notwithstanding this, in the commencement of the ensuing year,\r\nQuintus Servilius Ahala, Lucius Genucius being consuls, a day of trial\r\nis appointed for Manlius, by Marcus Pomponius, tribune of the commons.\r\nHis severity in the levies, carried not only to the fining of the\r\ncitizens, but even to the laceration of their bodies, those who had not\r\nanswered to their names being some beaten with rods, others thrown into\r\nprison, was hateful; and more hateful than all was his violent temper,\r\nand the surname of Imperiosus, offensive to a free state, adopted by him\r\nfrom an ostentation of severity, which he exercised not more against\r\nstrangers than his nearest friends, and even those of his own blood. And\r\namong other things, the tribune alleged as a charge against him that \"he\r\nhad banished his son, a youth convicted of no improper conduct, from the\r\ncity, home, household gods, forum, light, from the society of his\r\nequals, and consigned him in a manner to a prison or workhouse; where a\r\nyouth of dictatorian rank, born of a very high family, should learn by\r\nhis daily suffering that he was descended of a truly imperious father.\r\nAnd for what offence? because he was not eloquent, nor ready in\r\ndiscourse. Which defect of nature, whether ought it to be treated with\r\nleniency if there were a particle of humanity in him, or ought it to be\r\npunished, and rendered more remarkable by harsh treatment? The dumb\r\nbeasts even, if any of their offspring happen to be badly formed, are\r\nnot the less careful in nourishing and cherishing them. But Lucius\r\nManlius aggravated the misfortune of his son by severity, and further\r\nclogged the slowness of his intellects; and if there were in him even\r\nthe least spark of natural ability he extinguished it by a rustic life\r\nand a clownish education, and keeping him among cattle.\"\r\n\r\n5. By these charges the minds of all were exasperated against him more\r\nthan that of the young man himself: nay, on the contrary, being grieved\r\nthat he was even the cause of public odium and accusations to his\r\nfather, that all the gods and men might know that he would rather afford\r\naid to his father than to his enemies, he forms the design,\r\ncharacteristic of a rude and rustic mind no doubt, and though of a\r\nprecedent not conformable to the rules of civil life, yet commendable\r\nfor its filial piety. Having furnished himself with a knife, without the\r\nknowledge of any one he proceeds early in the morning into the city, and\r\nfrom the gate straightway to the house of Marcus Pomponius the tribune:\r\nhe tells the porter, that he wanted to see his master immediately, and\r\nbid him to announce that he was Titus Manlius, son of Lucius. Being\r\nintroduced immediately, (for he had hopes that the youth, incensed\r\nagainst his father, brought either some new charge, or some advice to\r\naccomplish the project,) after mutual greeting, he says that there were\r\nsome matters which he wished to transact with him in private. Then, all\r\npersons being ordered to withdraw to a distance, he draws his dagger;\r\nand standing over the couch with his dagger ready to strike, he\r\nthreatens that he would immediately stab him, unless he would swear in\r\nthe words which he would dictate, that \"he never would hold a meeting of\r\nthe commons for the purpose of prosecuting his father.\" The tribune\r\nalarmed, (for he saw the steel glittering before his eyes, himself alone\r\nand unarmed; the other a young man, and very powerful, and what was no\r\nless terrifying, savagely ferocious in his bodily strength,) swears in\r\nthe terms in which he was obliged; and afterwards acknowledged that\r\nforced by this proceeding he gave up his undertaking. Nor though the\r\ncommons would have preferred that an opportunity was afforded them of\r\npassing sentence on so cruel and tyrannical a culprit, they were not\r\nmuch displeased that the son had dared to act so in behalf of his\r\nfather; and that was the more commendable in this, that such great\r\nseverity on the part of the father had not weaned his mind from his\r\nfilial affection. Wherefore the pleading of his cause was not only\r\ndispensed with for the father, but the matter even became a source of\r\nhonour to the young man; and when it had been determined on that year\r\nfor the first time that tribunes of the soldiers for the legions should\r\nbe appointed by suffrage, (for before that the commanders themselves\r\nused to appoint them, as they now do those whom they call Rufuli,) he\r\nobtained the second place among six, without any merit of a civil or\r\nmilitary nature to conciliate public favour; as he had spent his youth\r\nin the country and at a distance from all intercourse with the world.\r\n\r\n6. On the same year the middle of the forum is said to have fallen in to\r\nan immense depth, forming a sort of vast cave, either by reason of an\r\nearthquake, or some other violent cause; nor could that gulf be filled\r\nup by throwing earth into it, every one exerting himself to the utmost,\r\nuntil by the admonition of the gods an inquiry began to be instituted,\r\nas to what constituted the chief strength of the Roman people? for the\r\nsoothsayers declare that must be devoted to that place, if they desired\r\nthe Roman state to be perpetual. Then they tell us that Marcus Curtius,\r\na youth distinguished in war, reproved them for hesitating, whether\r\nthere was any greater Roman good than arms and valour. Silence being\r\nmade, looking to the temples of the immortal gods, which command a view\r\nof the forum, and towards the Capitol, and extending his hands at one\r\ntime towards heaven, at another towards the infernal gods, through the\r\ngaping aperture of the earth, he devoted himself: then, mounted on a\r\nhorse accoutred in the most gorgeous style possible, he plunged in full\r\narmour into the opening, and offerings and the fruits of the earth were\r\nthrown in over him by the multitude of men and women, and the lake was\r\ncalled Curtian not from Curtius Mettus, the ancient soldier of Titus\r\nTatius, but from this circumstance. If any way would lead one's inquiry\r\nto the truth, industry would not be wanting: now, when length of time\r\nprecludes all certainty of evidence, we must stand by the rumour of\r\ntradition; and the name of the lake must be accounted for from this more\r\nrecent story. After due attention being paid to so great a prodigy, the\r\nsenate, during the same year, being consulted regarding the Hernicians,\r\n(after having sent heralds to demand restitution in vain,) voted, that a\r\nmotion be submitted on the earliest day to the people on the subject of\r\ndeclaring war against the Hernicians, and the people, in full assembly,\r\nordered it. That province fell by lot to the consul Lucius Genucius. The\r\nstate was in anxious suspense, because he was the first plebeian consul\r\nthat was about to conduct a war under his own auspices, being sure to\r\njudge of the good or bad policy of establishing a community of honours,\r\naccording as the matter should turn out. Chance so arranged it that\r\nGenucius, marching against the enemy with a considerable force, fell\r\ninto an ambush; the legions being routed by reason of a sudden panic,\r\nthe consul was slain after being surrounded by persons who knew not whom\r\nthey had slain. When this news was brought to Rome, the patricians, by\r\nno means so grieved for the public disaster, as elated at the\r\nunsuccessful guidance of the plebeian consul, every where exclaim, \"They\r\nmight now go, and elect consuls from the commons, they might transfer\r\nthe auspices where it was impious to do so. The patricians might by a\r\nvote of the people be driven from their own exclusive honour: whether\r\nhad this inauspicious law availed also against the immortal gods? They\r\nhad vindicated their authority, their auspices; which as soon as ever\r\nthey were defiled by one by whom it was contrary to human and divine law\r\nthat they should have been, the destruction of the army with its leader\r\nwas a warning, that elections should hereafter be conducted in utter\r\nviolation of the rights of birth.\" The senate-house and the forum\r\nresound with expressions such as these. Appius Claudius, because he had\r\ndissuaded the law, and now with greater authority blamed the issue of a\r\nmeasure which had been found fault with by himself, the consul Servilius\r\nappoints dictator by the general wish of the patricians, and a levy and\r\ncessation of business are procaimed.\r\n\r\n7. Before the dictator and the new legions could arrive among the\r\nHernicians, matters were conducted with great success under the\r\ndirection of Caius Sulpicius the lieutenant-general, making use of a\r\nfavourable opportunity. On the Hernicians, who after the death of the\r\nconsul came up contemptuously to the Roman camp with the certainty of\r\ntaking it, a sally was made by the exhortations of the consul, the minds\r\nof the soldiers also being full of rage and indignation. The Hernicians\r\nwere much disappointed in their hopes of approaching the rampart; in\r\nsuch complete confusion did they retire from thence. Then on the arrival\r\nof the dictator the new army is joined to the old, the forces are\r\ndoubled; and the dictator in a public assembly, by bestowing praises on\r\nthe lieutenant-general and the soldiers by whose valour the camp had\r\nbeen defended, at the same time raises the spirits of those who heard\r\ntheir own deserved praises, and at the same time stimulates the others\r\nto rival such valour. With no less vigour are the military preparations\r\nmade on the part of the enemy, who, mindful of the honour previously\r\nacquired, and not ignorant that the enemy had increased their strength,\r\naugment their forces also. The entire Hernician race, all of military\r\nage, are called out. Eight cohorts, each consisting of four hundred men,\r\nthe chosen strength of their people, are levied. This, the select flower\r\nof their youth, they filled with hope and courage by their having\r\ndecreed that they should receive double pay. They were exempt also from\r\nmilitary work, that, being reserved for the single labour of fighting,\r\nthey might feel that they should make exertions more than are made by\r\nordinary men. They are placed in an extraordinary position in the field,\r\nthat their valour might be the more conspicuous. A plain two miles in\r\nbreadth separated the Roman camp from the Hernicians; in the middle of\r\nthis, the spaces being about equal on both sides, they came to an\r\nengagement. At first the fight was kept up with doubtful hope; the Roman\r\ncavalry having repeatedly essayed to no purpose to break the enemy's\r\nline by their charge. When their fighting as cavalry was less marked by\r\nsuccess than by great efforts, the cavalry, having first consulted the\r\ndictator, and then obtained his permission, leaving their horses behind,\r\nrush forward in front of the line, with a loud shout, and recommence the\r\nbattle after a new style; nor could they be resisted, had not the\r\nextraordinary cohorts, possessing equal vigour both of body and spirit,\r\nthrown themselves in their way.\r\n\r\n8. Then the contest is carried on between the leading men of the two\r\nstates. Whatever the common fortune of war carried off from either side,\r\nthe loss was many times greater than can be estimated by the numbers:\r\nthe rest, an armed populace, as if they had delegated the fight to the\r\nleading men, rest the issue of their own success on the bravery of\r\nothers. Many fall on both sides; more are wounded. At length the\r\nhorsemen, chiding each other, asking, \"what now remained,\" if neither\r\nwhen mounted they had made an impression on the enemy, nor as infantry\r\ndid they achieve any thing of moment; what third mode of fighting did\r\nthey wait for? Why had they so fiercely rushed forward before the line,\r\nand fought in a post not belonging to them? Aroused by these mutual\r\nchidings, they raise the shout anew, and press forward; and first they\r\nmade the enemy shrink, then made them give way, and at length fairly\r\nmade them turn their backs. Nor is it easy to say what circumstance\r\nobtained the advantage against strength so well matched; except that the\r\nconstant fortune of both people might have raised or depressed their\r\nspirits. The Romans pursued the Hernicians in their flight to their\r\ncamp; they refrained from attacking the camp, because it was late. The\r\nfact of not having finished the sacrifices with success detained the\r\ndictator, so that he could not give the signal before noon, and hence\r\nthe contest was protracted till night. Next day the camp of the\r\nHernicians was deserted, and some wounded men were found left behind,\r\nand the main body of the fugitives was routed by the Signians, as their\r\nstandards were seen passing by their walls but thinly attended, and\r\ndispersed over the country in precipitate flight. Nor was the victory an\r\nunbloody one to the Romans; a fourth part of the soldiers perished; and,\r\nwhere there was no less of loss, several Roman horsemen fell.\r\n\r\n9. On the following year, when the consuls Caius Sulpicius and Caius\r\nLicinius Calvus led an army against the Hernicians, and finding no enemy\r\nin the country took their city Ferentinum by storm, as they were\r\nreturning thence, the Tiburtians shut their gates against them. Though\r\nmany complaints had been made on both sides before this, this was the\r\ndetermining cause why war was declared against the Tiburtian people,\r\nrestitution having been demanded through heralds. It is sufficiently\r\nascertained that Titus Quinctius Pennus was dictator that year, and that\r\nServius Cornelius Maluginensis was his master of the horse. Macer\r\nLicinius writes, that he was named by the consul for the purpose of\r\nholding the elections, because his colleague hastening to have the\r\nelections over before undertaking the war, that he might continue the\r\nconsulship, he thought it right to thwart his ambitious designs. This\r\nbeing designed as a compliment to his own family, renders the authority\r\nof Licinius of the less weight. As I find no mention of that\r\ncircumstance in the more ancient annals, my mind inclines me to consider\r\nthat the dictator was appointed on account of the Gallic war. On that\r\nyear, certainly, the Gauls pitched their camp at the third stone on the\r\nSalarian road, at the further side of the bridge of the Anio. The\r\ndictator, after he had proclaimed a cessation of civil business on\r\naccount of the Gallic tumult, bound all the younger citizens by the\r\nmilitary oath; and having set forth from the city with a great army,\r\npitched his camp on the hither bank of the Anio. The bridge lay between\r\nboth armies, neither side attempting to break it down, lest it should be\r\nan indication of fear. There were frequent skirmishes for the possession\r\nof the bridge; nor could it be clearly determined who were masters of\r\nit, the superiority being so indecisive. A Gaul of very large stature\r\nadvanced on the bridge, then unoccupied, and says with as loud a voice\r\nas he could exert, \"Let the bravest man that Rome now possesses come\r\nforward here to battle, that the event of an engagement between us both\r\nmay show which nation is superior in war.\"\r\n\r\n10. There was for a long time silence among the young Roman nobility, as\r\nthey were both ashamed to decline the contest, and unwilling to claim\r\nthe principal post of danger. Then Titus Manlius, son of Lucius, the\r\nsame who had freed his father from the vexatious persecution of the\r\ntribune, proceeds from his station to the dictator: \"Without your\r\ncommands, general, I would never fight out of the ordinary course, not\r\nthough I should see certain victory before me. If you permit me, I wish\r\nto show that brute, who insolently makes such a parade before the\r\nenemy's line, that I am sprung from that family which dislodged a body\r\nof Gauls from the Tarpeian rock.\" Then the dictator says, \"Titus\r\nManlius, may you prosper for your valour and dutiful affection to your\r\nfather and your country. Go on, and make good the invincibility of the\r\nRoman name with the aid of the gods.\" His companions then arm the youth;\r\nhe takes a footman's shield, girds himself with a Spanish sword, fit for\r\na close fight. When armed and equipped, they lead him out against the\r\nGaul, who exhibited stolid exultation, and (for the ancients thought\r\nthat also worthy of mention) thrust out his tongue in derision. They\r\nthen retire to their station; and the two being armed, are left in the\r\nmiddle space, more after the manner of a spectacle, than according to\r\nthe law of combat, by no means well matched, according to those who\r\njudged by sight and appearance. The one had a body enormous in size,\r\nglittering in a vest of various colours, and in armour painted and\r\ninlaid with gold; the other had a middle stature, as is seen among\r\nsoldiers, and a mien unostentatious, in arms fit for ready use rather\r\nthan adapted for show. He had no song, no capering, nor idle flourishing\r\nof arms, but his breast, teeming with courage and silent rage, had\r\nreserved all its ferocity for the decision of the contest. When they\r\ntook their stand between the two armies, the minds of so many\r\nindividuals around them suspended between hope and fear, the Gaul, like\r\na huge mass threatening to fall on that which was beneath it, stretching\r\nforward his shield with his left hand, discharged an ineffectual cut of\r\nhis sword with a great noise on the armour of his foe as he advanced\r\ntowards him. The Roman, raising the point of his sword, after he had\r\npushed aside the lower part of the enemy's shield with his own, and\r\nclosing on him so as to be exempt from the danger of a wound, insinuated\r\nhimself with his entire body between the body and arms of the foe, with\r\none and immediately with another thrust pierced his belly and groin, and\r\nstretched his enemy now prostrate over a vast extent of ground. Without\r\noffering the body of the prostrate foe any other indignity, he despoiled\r\nit of one chain; which, though smeared with blood, he threw around his\r\nneck. Dismay with astonishment now held the Gauls motionless. The\r\nRomans, elated with joy, advancing from their post to meet their\r\nchampion, with congratulations and praises conduct him to the dictator.\r\nAmong them uttering some uncouth jests in military fashion somewhat\r\nresembling verses, the name of Torquatus was heard: this name, being\r\nkept up, became afterwards an honour to the descendants even of the\r\nfamily. The dictator added a present of a golden crown, and before a\r\npublic assembly extolled that action with the highest praises.\r\n\r\n11. And, indeed, of so great moment was the contest with respect to the\r\nissue of the war in general, that on the night following the army of the\r\nGauls, having abandoned their camp in confusion, passed over into the\r\nterritory of Tibur, and from thence soon after into Campania, having\r\nconcluded an alliance for the purpose of war, and being abundantly\r\nsupplied with provision by the Tiburtians. That was the reason why, on\r\nthe next year, Caius Pætelius Balbus, consul, though the province of the\r\nHernicians had fallen to the lot of his colleague, Marcus Fabius\r\nAmbustus, led an army, by order of the people, against the Tiburtians.\r\nTo whose assistance when the Gauls came back from Campania, dreadful\r\ndevastations were committed in the Lavican, Tusculan, and Alban\r\nterritories. And though the state was satisfied with a consul as leader\r\nagainst the Tiburtian enemy, the alarm created by the Gauls rendered it\r\nnecessary that a dictator should be appointed. Quintus Servilius Ahala\r\nhaving been appointed, named Titus Quinctius master of the horse; and\r\nwith the sanction of the senate, vowed the great games, should that war\r\nturn out successfully. The dictator then, having ordered the consular\r\narmy to remain to confine the Tiburtians to their own war, bound all the\r\nyounger citizens by the military oath, none declining the service. A\r\nbattle was fought not far from the Colline gate with the strength of the\r\nentire city, in the sight of their parents, wives, and children: which\r\nbeing great incitements to courage, even when these relatives are\r\nabsent, being now placed before their eyes, fired the soldiers at once\r\nwith feelings of shame and compassion. Great havoc being made on both\r\nsides, the Gallic army is at length worsted. In their flight they make\r\nfor Tibur, as being the main stay of the war; and being intercepted\r\nwhilst straggling by the consul Pætelius not far from Tibur, and the\r\nTiburtians having come out to bring them aid, they are with the latter\r\ndriven within the gates. Matters were managed with distinguished success\r\nboth by the dictator and the consul. And the other consul, Fabius, at\r\nfirst in slight skirmishes, and at length in one single battle, defeated\r\nthe Hernicians, when they attacked him with all their forces. The\r\ndictator, after passing the highest encomiums on the consuls in the\r\nsenate and before the people, and yielding up the honour of his own\r\nexploits to them, resigned his dictatorship. Pætelius enjoyed a double\r\ntriumph, over the Gauls and the Tiburtians. Fabius was satisfied with\r\nentering the city in ovation. The Tiburtians derided the triumph of\r\nPætelius; \"for where,\" they said, \"had he encountered them in the field?\r\nthat a few of their people having gone outside the gates to witness the\r\nflight and confusion of the Gauls, on seeing an attack made on\r\nthemselves, and that those who came in the way were slaughtered without\r\ndistinction, had retired within the city. Did that seem to the Romans\r\nworthy of a triumph? They should not consider it an extraordinary and\r\nwondrous feat to raise a tumult at the enemy's gates, as they should\r\nsoon see greater confusion before their own walls.\"\r\n\r\n12. Accordingly in the year following, Marcus Popilius Lænas and Cneius\r\nManlius being consuls, during the first silence of the night having set\r\nout from Tibur with an army prepared for action, they came to the city\r\nof Rome. The suddenness of the thing, and the panic occurring at night,\r\noccasioned some terror among them on being suddenly aroused from sleep;\r\nfurther, the ignorance of many as to who the enemy were or whence they\r\nhad come. However they quickly ran to arms, and guards were posted at\r\nthe gates, and the walls were secured with troops; and when daylight\r\nshowed but an inconsiderable force before the walls, and that the enemy\r\nwere none other than the Tiburtines, the consuls, having gone forth from\r\nthe two gates, attack on either side the army of these now advancing up\r\nto the walls; and it became obvious that they had come relying rather on\r\nthe opportunity than on their valour, for they hardly sustained the\r\nfirst charge of the Romans. Nay more, it was evident that their coming\r\nproved an advantage to the Romans, and that a disturbance just arising\r\nbetween the patricians and commons was checked by the dread of a war so\r\nnear them. In the next war there was another irruption of the enemy,\r\nmore terrible to the country than to the city. The Tarquinians overran\r\nthe Roman frontiers, committing depredations on that side more\r\nespecially where they are contiguous to Etruria; and restitution being\r\ndemanded in vain, the new consuls, Cneius Fabius and Caius Plautius,\r\nproclaimed war on them by order of the people; and that province fell to\r\nthe lot of Fabius, the Hernicians to Plautius. A rumour of a Gallic war\r\nalso was gaining ground. But amid their many terrors, they had some\r\nconsolation from a peace granted to the Latins at their own request, as\r\nalso from a considerable reinforcement of soldiers received from them in\r\nconformity with an old treaty, which, they had for several years ceased\r\nto observe. When the Roman cause was supported by this aid, the tidings\r\nthat the Gauls had come to Præneste and were encamped near to Pedum,\r\nwere less heeded. It was determined that Caius Sulpicius should be\r\nappointed dictator. Caius Plautius the consul, being sent for for the\r\npurpose, nominated him; Marcus Valerius was assigned as master of the\r\nhorse to the dictator. These having selected the best of the soldiers\r\nout of the two consular armies, led them against the Gauls. This war was\r\nmore tedious than was satisfactory to either party. When at first the\r\nGauls only were desirous of fighting, afterwards the Roman soldiers\r\nconsiderably surpassed the ferocity of the Gauls in their ardour for\r\narms and battle; it by no means met the approbation of the dictator when\r\nno urgent necessity existed to run any hazard against an enemy, whose\r\nstrength time and inconvenient situation would daily impair, in total\r\ninactivity, without provisions previously laid up or any fortified\r\nsituation; besides, being persons of such minds and bodies, that all\r\ntheir force lay in brisk exertion, whilst the same flagged by short\r\ndelay. On these considerations the dictator protracted the war, and\r\ndenounced a severe penalty against any one who should fight against the\r\nenemy without orders. The soldiers, being much dissatisfied with this,\r\nfirst censured the dictator, in their conversation, when on guard and on\r\nthe watches; sometimes they found fault with the patricians in general,\r\nfor not having commanded the war to be conducted by the consuls. \"That\r\nan excellent general, an extraordinary commander, had been selected, who\r\nthinks that whilst he does nothing victory will fly down from heaven\r\ninto his lap.\" Afterwards they gave expression to these same sentiments\r\nopenly during the day, and to others still more outrageous; that \"they\r\nwould either fight without the general's orders, or would proceed in a\r\nbody to Rome.\" The centurions, too, began to mix with the soldiers; and\r\nthey murmured not only in their own quarters, but now their observations\r\nbegan to be confounded together at head-quarters and at the general's\r\ntent, and the crowd increased to the magnitude of an assembly, and they\r\nnow shouted from all quarters that \"they should go forthwith to the\r\ndictator; that Sextus Tullius should speak in behalf of the army, so as\r\nbecame his courage.\"\r\n\r\n13. Tullius was now for the seventh time first centurion of a legion,\r\nnor was there in the army, at least among those who served in the\r\ninfantry, a man more distinguished by his conduct. He, at the head of a\r\nbody of the soldiers, proceeds to the tribunal, and to Sulpicius, not\r\nmore surprised at the crowd than at Tullius, the leader of the crowd, a\r\nsoldier most obedient to command, he says: \"Dictator, the whole army,\r\nconceiving that they have been condemned by you of cowardice, and kept\r\nwithout their arms by way of disgrace, has entreated me to plead their\r\ncause before you. In truth, if having deserted our post any where, if\r\nturning our backs to the enemy, if the disgraceful loss of our\r\nstandards could be laid to our charge, I would still think it but just\r\nthat we should obtain this from you, that you would suffer us to redeem\r\nour fault by our bravery, and to blot out the memory of our disgrace by\r\nnewly acquired glory. Even the legions defeated at the Allia, when they\r\nafterwards set out from Veii, recovered by their valour the same country\r\nwhich they had lost through a panic. We, by the bounty of the gods, your\r\ngood fortune, and that of the Roman people, have both our cause and our\r\nglory uninjured. Though of glory I would scarcely venture to say any\r\nthing; since both the enemy scoff at us with every kind of insult, as\r\nwomen hiding ourselves behind a rampart; and you, our general, what we\r\ngrieve at still more, judge your army to be without spirit, without\r\narms, without hands; and before you had made trial of us, you have so\r\ndespaired of us, as to consider yourself to be the leader of a set of\r\nmaimed and disabled men. For what else shall we believe to be the reason\r\nwhy you, a veteran general, most valiant in war, sit down with hands\r\nfolded, as they say. But however it may be, it is fitter that you should\r\nseem to doubt of our courage than we of yours. If however this plan of\r\nproceeding be not your own, but a public one, if some concerted scheme\r\nof the patricians, and not the Gallic war, keeps us exiled from the\r\ncity, from our homes, I beg that you consider what I may say here, as\r\naddressed not by soldiers to their general, but to the patricians by the\r\ncommons, who tell you that as ye have your separate plans, so will they\r\nhave theirs. Who in the name of goodness can be angry that we (consider\r\nourselves) your soldiers, not your slaves? as men who have been sent to\r\nwar, not into exile? as men who, if any one give the signal, and lead\r\nthem out into the field, will fight as becomes men and Romans? as men\r\nwho, if there be no need of arms, would spend their idle time in Rome\r\nrather than in a camp? Consider these observations as addressed to the\r\npatricians. As your soldiers, we entreat you, general, to afford us an\r\nopportunity of fighting. We both desire to conquer, and also to conquer\r\nwith you for our leader; to confer on you the distinguished laurel, with\r\nyou to enter the city in triumph; following your car with\r\ncongratulations and rejoicings, to approach the temple of Jupiter\r\nsupremely great and good.\" The entreaties of the multitude followed the\r\nspeech of Tullius; and from every side they cried out, that he would\r\ngive the signal, that he would order them to take arms.\r\n\r\n14. The dictator, though he saw that a good result was brought about by\r\na precedent not to be approved of, yet took on himself to do what the\r\nsoldiers wished, and inquires of Tullius privately, what the nature of\r\nthis transaction was, or on what precedent it was done? Tullius\r\nearnestly entreated the dictator \"not to believe him forgetful of\r\nmilitary discipline, of himself, nor of the respect due to his general;\r\nthat he had not declined to put himself at the head of the excited\r\nmultitude, who generally were like to their instigators, lest any other\r\nperson might step forward, such an excited multitude were wont to elect.\r\nThat for his own part he would do nothing without the orders of his\r\ngeneral; that he also however must carefully see, that he keep the army\r\nin obedience. That minds so excited could not be put off: that they\r\nwould choose for themselves time and place, if they were not granted by\r\nthe general.\" While they are conversing in this way, it so happened,\r\nthat as a Gaul was driving away some cattle feeding on the outside of\r\nthe rampart two Roman soldiers took them from him. Stones were thrown at\r\nthem by the Gauls, then a shout was raised at the next Roman post, and\r\nseveral ran forward on both sides. And now matters were not far from a\r\nregular engagement, had not the contest been quickly stopped by the\r\ncenturions. By this event the testimony of Tullius was certainly\r\nconfirmed with the dictator; and the matter not admitting of further\r\ndelay, a proclamation is issued that they were to fight on the day\r\nfollowing. The dictator however, as one who went into the field relying\r\nmore on the courage of his men than on their numerical strength, began\r\nto look about and consider how he might by some artifice strike terror\r\ninto the enemy. With a sagacious mind he devises a new project, which\r\nmany generals both of our own and of foreign countries have since\r\nadopted, some indeed in our own times. He orders the panniers to be\r\ntaken from the mules, and two side-cloths only being left, he mounts the\r\nmuleteers on them, equipped with arms partly belonging to the prisoners,\r\nand some to the sick. About a thousand of these being equipped, he mixes\r\nwith them one hundred horsemen, and orders them to go up during the\r\nnight into the mountains over the camp and to conceal themselves in the\r\nwoods, and not to stir from thence, till they should receive a signal\r\nfrom him. As soon as day dawned, he himself began to extend his line\r\nalong the bottom of the mountain, for the express purpose that the enemy\r\nshould face the mountains. The measures for infusing groundless terror\r\nbeing now completed, which terror indeed proved almost more serviceable\r\nthan real strength, the leaders of the Gauls first believed that the\r\nRomans would not come down to the plain: then when they saw them begin\r\non a sudden to descend, they also, on their part eager for the fight,\r\nrush forward to the encounter; and the battle commenced before the\r\nsignal could be given by the leaders.\r\n\r\n15. The Gauls attacked the right wing with greater fierceness, nor could\r\nthey have been withstood, had not the dictator happened to be on the\r\nspot, rebuking Sextus Tullius by name, and asking him, \"Was it in this\r\nway he had engaged that the soldiers would fight? Where now were the\r\nshouts of those demanding their arms? where the threats that they would\r\ncommence the fight without the orders of their general? Behold the\r\ngeneral himself calling them with a loud voice to battle, and advancing\r\nin arms before the front of the line. Would any of those now follow him,\r\nwho were just now to have led the way; fierce in the camp, but cowards\r\nin the field?\" What they heard was all true; wherefore shame applied\r\nsuch strong incentives, that they rushed upon the weapons of the enemy,\r\ntheir attention being turned away from the thought of danger. This\r\nonset, which was almost frantic at first, threw the enemy into disorder;\r\nthen the cavalry charging them whilst thus disordered, made them turn\r\ntheir backs. The dictator himself, when he saw their line wavering in\r\none direction, carries round some troops to the left wing, where he saw\r\na crowd of the enemy collected, and gave to those who were on the\r\nmountain the signal which had been agreed on. When a new shout arose\r\nfrom that quarter also, and they seemed to make their way in an oblique\r\ndirection, down the mountain to the camp of the Gauls; then through fear\r\nlest they should be cut off from it, the fight was given up, and they\r\nwere carried towards the camp with precipitate speed. Where when Marcus\r\nValerius, master of the horse, who, after having routed their left wing,\r\nwas riding towards the enemies' entrenchment, met them, they turn their\r\nflight to the mountains and woods: and the greater part of them were\r\nthere intercepted by the fallacious show of horsemen, and the muleteers,\r\nand of those whom panic had carried into the woods, a dreadful slaughter\r\ntook place after the battle was ended. Nor did any one since Camillus\r\nobtain a more complete triumph over the Gauls than Caius Sulpicius. A\r\nconsiderable weight of gold taken from the Gallic spoils, which he\r\nenclosed in hewn stone, he consecrated in the Capitol. The same year the\r\nconsuls also were engaged in fighting with various success. For the\r\nHernicians were vanquished and subdued by Cneius Plautius. His colleague\r\nFabius fought against the Tarquinians without caution or prudence; nor\r\nwas the loss sustained in the field so much [a subject of regret] as\r\nthat the Tarquinians put to death three hundred and seven Roman\r\nsoldiers, their prisoners, by which barbarous mode of punishment the\r\ndisgrace of the Roman people was rendered considerably more remarkable.\r\nTo this disaster moreover was added, the laying waste of the Roman\r\nterritory, which the Privernatians, and afterwards the people of\r\nVelitræ, committed by a sudden incursion. The same year two tribes, the\r\nPomptine and Publilian, were added. The votive games, which Marcus\r\nFurius in his dictatorship had vowed, were performed; and a proposition\r\nwas then for the first time made to the people regarding bribery at\r\nelections by Caius Pætilius, tribune of the commons, with the\r\napprobation of the senate; and by that bill they thought that the\r\nambition of new men in particular, who had been accustomed to go around\r\nthe markets and places of meeting, was checked.\r\n\r\n16. Not equally pleasing to the patricians on the following year was a\r\nlaw passed in the consulship of Caius Marcius and Cneius Manlius, by\r\nMarcus Duilius and Lucius Mænius, tribunes of the commons, regarding the\r\ninterest of money at twelve per cent., and the people received and\r\npassed it with much more eagerness. In addition to the new wars\r\ndetermined on the preceding year, a new enemy arose in the Faliscians,\r\nin consequence of a double charge; both that their youth had taken up\r\narms in conjunction with the Tarquinians, and because they had refused\r\nto restore to the demand of the Roman heralds those who had fled to\r\nFalerii, after the unsuccessful battle. That province fell to the lot of\r\nCneius Manlius, Marcius led the army into the Privernatian territory,\r\nwhich, from the long continuance of peace, was in a flourishing\r\ncondition; and he enriched the soldiers with abundance of spoil. To the\r\ngreat quantity of effects he added an act of munificence; for, by\r\nsetting aside nothing for public use, he favoured the soldier in his\r\nendeavours to accumulate private property. When the Privernatians had\r\ntaken their post in a well-fortified camp under their own walls, having\r\nsummoned the soldiers to an assembly, he says to them, \"I now give to\r\nyou the camp and city of the enemy for plunder, if you promise me that\r\nyou will exert yourselves bravely in the field, and that you are not\r\nbetter prepared for plunder than for fighting.\" With loud shouts they\r\ncall for the signal, and elated and buoyed up with certain confidence,\r\nthey proceed to the battle. Then, in front of the line, Sextus Tullius,\r\nwhom we have already mentioned, exclaims, \"Behold, general,\" says he,\r\n\"how your army are performing their promises to you;\" and laying aside\r\nhis javelin, he attacks the enemy sword in hand. The whole van follow\r\nTullius, and at the first onset put the enemy to flight; then pursuing\r\nthem, when routed, to the town, when they were just applying the scaling\r\nladders to the walls, they received the city on a surrender. A triumph\r\nwas had over the Privernatians. Nothing worth mentioning was achieved by\r\nthe other consul, except that he, by an unusual precedent, holding an\r\nassembly of the tribes in the camp at Sutrium, he passed a law regarding\r\nthe twentieth part of the value of those set free by manumission. As by\r\nthis law no small revenue was added to the treasury, now low, the senate\r\ngave it their sanction. But the tribunes of the commons, influenced not\r\nso much by the law as by the precedent, passed a law, making it a\r\ncapital offence for any one in future to summon an assembly of the\r\npeople at a distance from the city; for if that were allowed, there was\r\nnothing, no matter how destructive to the people, that might not he done\r\nby soldiers, who had sworn allegiance to their consul. The same year\r\nCaius Licinius Stolo was condemned in a fine of ten thousand _asses_, on\r\nhis own law, by Marcus Popillius Lænas, because he possessed in\r\nconjunction with his son a thousand acres of land, and because he had\r\nattempted to evade the law by emancipating his son.\r\n\r\n17. The next two consuls, Marcus Fabius Ambustus a second time, and\r\nMarcus Popillius Lænas a second time, had two wars on their hands. The\r\none with the Tiburtians was easy, which Licinius managed, who drove the\r\nenemy into their city, and laid waste their lands. The Faliscians and\r\nTarquinians routed the other consul in the commencement of the fight.\r\nFrom these parties the utmost terror was raised, in consequence of their\r\npriests, who, by carrying before them lighted torches and the figures of\r\nserpents, and advancing with the gait of furies, disconcerted the Roman\r\nsoldiers by their extraordinary appearance; and then indeed they ran\r\nback to their entrenchments, in all the hurry of trepidation, as if\r\nfrenzied or thunderstruck; and then when the consul, and\r\nlieutenant-generals, and tribunes began to ridicule and chide them for\r\nbeing frightened like children at mere sights, shame suddenly changed\r\ntheir minds; and they rushed, as if blindfold, on those very objects\r\nfrom which they had fled. Having, therefore, dissipated the idle\r\ncontrivance of the enemy, having attacked those who were in arms, they\r\ndrove their whole line before them, and having got possession of the\r\ncamp also on that day, and obtained great booty, they returned\r\nvictorious, uttering military jests, both on the stratagem of the enemy\r\nas also on their own panic. Then the whole Etruscan nation is aroused,\r\nand under the conduct of the Tarquinians and Faliscians, they come to\r\nSalinæ. To meet this alarm, Caius Marcius Rutilus, being appointed\r\ndictator, the first plebeian who was so, named Caius Plautius, also a\r\nplebeian, master of the horse. This was deemed an indignity by the\r\npatricians, that the dictatorship also was now become common, and with\r\nall their exertions they prevented any thing from either being decreed\r\nor prepared for the dictator, for the prosecution of that war. With the\r\nmore promptitude, on that account, did the people order things, as\r\nproposed by the dictator. Having set out from the city, along both sides\r\nof the Tiber, and transporting his army on rafts whithersoever his\r\nintelligence of the enemy led him, he surprised many of them straggling\r\nabout in scattered parties, laying waste the lands. Moreover, he\r\nsuddenly attacked their camp and took it; and eight thousand of the\r\nenemy being made prisoners, all the rest being either slain or driven\r\nout of the Roman territory, he triumphed by order of the people, without\r\nthe sanction of the senate. Because they neither wished that the\r\nconsular elections should be held by a plebeian dictator or consul, and\r\nthe other consul, Fabius, was detained by the war, matters came to an\r\ninterregnum. There were then interreges in succession, Quintus\r\nServilius Ahala, Marcus Fabius, Cneius Manlius, Caius Fabius, Caius\r\nSulpicius, Lucius Æmilius, Quintus Servilius, Marcus Fabius Ambustas. In\r\nthe second interregnum a dispute arose, because two patrician consuls\r\nwere elected: and the tribunes protesting, Fabius the interrex said,\r\nthat \"it was a law in the twelve tables, that whatever the people\r\nordered last should be law and in force; that the suffrages of the\r\npeople were their orders.\" When the tribunes by their protest had been\r\nable to effect nothing else than to put off the elections, two\r\npatricians were chosen consuls, Caius Sulpicius Peticus a third time,\r\nMarcus Valerius Publicola; and on the same day they entered into office.\r\n\r\n18. On the four hundredth year after the building of the city of Rome,\r\nand the thirty-fifth after its recovery from the Gauls, the consulship\r\nbeing taken away from the commons after eleven years, consuls, both\r\npatricians, entered into office after the interregnum, Caius Sulpicius\r\nPeticus a third time, and Marcus Valerius Publicola. During this year\r\nEmpulum was taken from the Tiburtians with a struggle not worth\r\nmentioning; whether the war was waged there under the auspices of the\r\ntwo consuls, as some have stated; or whether the lands of the\r\nTarquinians were laid waste by the consul Sulpicius about the same time\r\nthat Valerius led the troops against the Tiburtians. The consuls had a\r\nmore arduous contest at home with the commons and tribunes. As two\r\npatricians had received the consulship, they considered that not only\r\ntheir resolution, but their honour also, was involved in their\r\nconsigning it to two patricians. For if the consulship were made a\r\nplebeian magistracy, they must either yield it up entirely, or possess\r\nit entire, which possession they had received from their fathers\r\nunimpaired. The commons on the other hand loudly remonstrate; \"Why did\r\nthey live; why were they reckoned in the number of citizens; if they\r\ncollectively cannot maintain that which was acquired by the firmness of\r\ntwo men, Lucius Sextius and Caius Licinius? That either kings, or\r\ndecemvirs, or, if there be any denomination of power more offensive,\r\nwould be submitted to rather than see both the consuls patricians, or\r\nrather than not obey and rule in turn; but the one half, located in\r\nperpetual power, thinks the commons born for no other purpose than to be\r\nsubservient.\" The tribunes are not remiss in encouraging the\r\ndisturbances; but amid the excited state of all scarcely any are\r\ndistinguished as leaders. When they had several times gone down to the\r\nCampus Martius to no purpose, and when many days of meeting had been\r\nspent in seditious movements; at length the resentment of the commons,\r\novercome by the perseverance of the consuls, broke out to such a degree,\r\nthat the commons followed in sorrow the tribunes, exclaiming, that there\r\nwas an end of liberty; that not only the Campus should be relinquished,\r\nbut the city also as being held captive and oppressed by the tyranny of\r\nthe patricians. The consuls, deserted by a part of the people, finish\r\nthe election nevertheless with the small number [who attended]. Both the\r\nconsuls elected were patricians, Marcus Fabius Ambustus a third time,\r\nTitus Quinctius. In some annals I find Marcus Popilius mentioned as\r\nconsul instead of Titus Quinctius.\r\n\r\n19. Two wars were conducted with success on that year: and they forced\r\nthe Tiburtians by force of arms to a surrender. The city of Sassula was\r\ntaken from them; and the other towns would have shared the same fate,\r\nhad not the entire nation laid down their arms, and put themselves under\r\nthe protection of the consul. A triumph was obtained by him over the\r\nTiburtians: in other respects the victory was a mild one. Rigorous\r\nseverity was practised against the Tarquinians. A great many being\r\nslaughtered in the field, out of a great number of prisoners three\r\nhundred and fifty-eight were selected, all of the highest rank, to be\r\nsent to Rome; the rest of the multitude were put to the sword. Nor were\r\nthe people more merciful towards those who had been sent to Rome. They\r\nwere all beaten with rods and beheaded in the middle of the forum. That\r\nwas the punishment retaliated on the enemy for their butchering the\r\nRomans in the forum of Tarquinii. The successes in war induced the\r\nSamnites to seek their friendship. A courteous answer was returned to\r\ntheir ambassadors by the senate: they were received into an alliance by\r\na treaty. The Roman commons had not the same success at home as in war.\r\nFor though the burden of interest money had been relieved by fixing the\r\nrate at one to the hundred, the poor were overwhelmed by the principal\r\nalone, and submitted to confinement. On this account, the commons took\r\nlittle heed either of the two consuls being patricians, or the\r\nmanagement of the elections, by reason of their private distresses.\r\nBoth consulships therefore remained with the patricians. The consuls\r\nappointed were Caius Sulpicius Pæticus a fourth time, Marcus Valerius\r\nPublicola a second time. Whilst the state was occupied with the Etrurian\r\nwar, [entered into] because a report prevailed that the people of Cære\r\nhad joined the Tarquinians through compassion for them from their\r\nrelationship, ambassadors from the Latins drew their attention to the\r\nVolscians, bringing tidings that an army enlisted and fully armed was\r\nnow on the point of attacking their frontiers; from thence that they\r\nwere to enter the Roman territory in order to commit depredations. The\r\nsenate therefore determined that neither affair should be neglected;\r\nthey ordered that troops should be raised for both purposes, and that\r\nthe consuls should cast lots for the provinces. The greater share of\r\ntheir anxiety afterwards inclined to the Etrurian war; after it was\r\nascertained, from a letter of the consul Sulpicius, to whom the province\r\nof Tarquinii had fallen, that the land around the Roman Salinæ had been\r\ndepopulated, and that part of the plunder had been carried away into the\r\ncountry of the people of Cære, and that the young men of that people\r\nwere certainly among the depredators. The senate therefore, having\r\nrecalled the consul Valerius, who was opposed to the Volscians, and who\r\nhad his camp on the frontiers of Tusculum, ordered him to nominate a\r\ndictator. He nominated Titus Manlius, son of Lucius. He, after he had\r\nappointed Aulus Cornelius Cossus his master of the horse, content with\r\nthe consular army, declared war against the Cæritians by order of the\r\npeople, with the sanction of the senate.\r\n\r\n20. Then for the first time were the Cæritians seized with a real dread\r\nof war, as if there was greater power in the words of the enemy to\r\nindicate war than in their own acts, who had provoked the Romans by\r\ndevastation; and they perceived how ill suited the contest was to their\r\nstrength. They repented of their depredations, and cursed the\r\nTarquinians as the instigators of the revolt. Nor did any one think of\r\npreparing arms and hostilities; but each strenuously urged the necessity\r\nof sending ambassadors to sue for pardon for their error. When their\r\nambassadors applied to the senate, being referred by the senate to the\r\npeople, they implored the gods, whose sacred utensils they had received\r\nin the Gallic war and treated with all due ceremony, that the same\r\ncompassion for them might influence the Romans now in a flourishing\r\ncondition, which had formerly influenced themselves when the state of\r\nthe Roman people was distressed; and turning to the temple of Vesta,\r\nthey invoked the bonds of hospitality subsisting [between themselves]\r\nand the flamens and vestals entered into by them with holy and religious\r\nzeal: \"Would any one believe that persons, who possessed such merits,\r\nhad suddenly become enemies without cause? or if they had committed any\r\nact in a hostile manner, that they had, through design rather than under\r\nthe influence of error from frenzy, so acted, as to cancel their former\r\nacts of kindness by recent injuries, more especially when conferred on\r\npersons so grateful, and that they would choose to themselves as enemies\r\nthe Roman people, now in the most flourishing state and most successful\r\nin war, whose friendship they had cultivated when they were distressed?\r\nThat they should not call it design, which should rather be called force\r\nand necessity. That the Tarquinians, passing through their territory\r\nwith a hostile army, after they had asked for nothing but a passage,\r\nforced with them some of their peasants, to accompany them in that\r\ndepredation, which was charged on them as a crime. That they were\r\nprepared to deliver them up, if it pleased them that they should be\r\ndelivered up; or that they should be subjected to punishment, if [they\r\ndesired] that they should be punished. That Cære, the sanctuary of the\r\nRoman people, the harbourer of its priests, the receptacle of the sacred\r\nutensils of Rome, they should suffer to escape, in regard to the ties of\r\nhospitality contracted with the vestals, and in regard to the religious\r\ndevotion paid to their gods, intact and unstained with the charge of\r\nhostilities committed.\" The people were influenced not so much by [the\r\nmerits of] the present case, as by their former deserts, so as to be\r\nunmindful rather of the injury than of the kindness. Peace was therefore\r\ngranted to the people of Cære, and it was resolved that the making of a\r\ntruce for one hundred years should be referred to a decree of the\r\nsenate. Against the Faliscians, implicated in the same charge, the force\r\nof the war was turned; but the enemy was no where found. Though their\r\nterritories were visited in all directions with devastation, they\r\nrefrained from besieging the towns; and the legions being brought back\r\nto Rome, the remainder of the year was spent in repairing the walls and\r\nthe towers, and the temple of Apollo was dedicated.\r\n\r\n21. At the close of the year a dispute between the patricians and\r\ncommons suspended the consular elections, the tribunes refusing to allow\r\nthe elections to be held, unless they were held conformably to the\r\nLicinian law; the dictator being determined to do away with the\r\nconsulate altogether from the state, rather than to make it common to\r\nthe patricians and the commons. Accordingly when, the elections being\r\nrepeatedly adjourned, the dictator resigned his office, matters came to\r\nan interregnum. Upon this, when the interreges found the commons\r\nincensed against the fathers, the contest was carried on by various\r\ndisturbances to the eleventh interrex. The tribunes held out as their\r\nplea, the protection of the Licinian law. The people had the painful\r\nsense of the increasing weight of interest nearer to their hearts; and\r\ntheir private troubles became predominant amid the public contests.\r\nThrough the wearisome effects of which the patricians ordered Lucius\r\nCornelius Scipio, the interrex, for peace' sake to observe the Licinian\r\nlaw in the election of consuls. To Publius Valerius Publicola, Caius\r\nMarcius Rutilus, a plebeian, was assigned as a colleague. Once their\r\nminds were disposed to concord, the new consuls, setting about to\r\nrelieve the affair of the interest money also, which seemed to prevent\r\nperfect unanimity, made the payment of the debts a matter of public\r\nconcern, five commissioners having been appointed, whom from their\r\nmanagement of the money they called bankers. By their justice and\r\ndiligence they deserved to have their names signalized by the records of\r\nevery history. They were Caius Duilius, Publius Decius Mus, Marcus\r\nPapirius, Quintus Publilius, and Titus Æmilius; who underwent a task\r\nmost difficult to be managed, and dissatisfactory in general to both\r\nparties, certainly always so to one, both with moderation in other\r\nrespects, as well as at the public expense, rather than with any loss\r\n[to the creditors]. For the tardy debts and those which were more\r\ntroublesome, rather by the inertness of the debtors than by want of\r\nmeans, either the treasury paid off, tables with money being placed in\r\nthe forum, in such a manner that the public was first secured; or a\r\nvaluation, at equitable prices, of their property freed them; so that\r\nnot only without injury, but even without complaints on either side, an\r\nimmense amount of debt was cleared off. After this a groundless alarm of\r\nan Etrurian war, as there was a report that the twelve states had\r\nconspired, rendered it necessary that a dictator should be appointed.\r\nCaius Julius was nominated in the camp, (for the decree of the senate\r\nwas sent thither to the consuls,) to whom Lucius Æmilius was attached as\r\nmaster of the horse. But all things were quiet abroad.\r\n\r\n22. An attempt made at home by the dictator, to have the election of two\r\npatrician consuls, brought the government to an interregnum. The two\r\ninterreges, Caius Sulpicius and Marcus Fabius, succeeded in that which\r\nthe dictator had in vain attempted, scil. in having both the consuls\r\nelected from the patricians, the people being rather more appeased in\r\nconsequence of the service done them in lightening their debts. The\r\npersons elected were, Caius Sulpicius Peticus himself, who first\r\nresigned the office of interrex, and Titus Quinctius Pennus. Some attach\r\nthe name of Kæso, others that of Caius to Quinctius. They both set out\r\nto the war, Quinctius to the Faliscian, Sulpicius to the Tarquinian; and\r\nthe enemy no where meeting them in the field, they waged war more\r\nagainst the lands than the men, by burning and laying waste every thing,\r\nby the debilitating effects of which, as of a slow consumption, the\r\npertinacity of both states was so broken, that they solicited a truce,\r\nfirst from the consuls, then through their permission from the senate.\r\nThey obtained a truce for forty years. Thus the concern regarding the\r\ntwo wars which were hanging over them being laid aside, whilst there was\r\nsome repose from arms, it was determined that a census should be\r\ninstituted, because the payment of the debt had changed the owners of\r\nmuch property. But when the assembly was proclaimed for the appointment\r\nof censors, Caius Marcius Rutilus, who had been the first plebeian\r\ndictator, having declared himself a candidate for the censorship,\r\ndisturbed the harmony of the different orders. This step he seemed to\r\nhave taken at an unseasonable time; because both the consuls then\r\nhappened to be patricians, who declared that they would take no account\r\nof him. But he both succeeded in his undertaking by his own\r\nperseverance, and the tribunes aided him by recovering a right lost in\r\nthe election of the consuls; and both the worth of the man brought him\r\nto the level of the highest honour, and also the commons were anxious\r\nthat the censorship also should be brought within their participation\r\nthrough the medium of the same person who had opened a way to the\r\ndictatorship. Nor was any dissent [from this feeling] evinced at the\r\nelection, so that Marcius was elected censor along with Cneius Manlius.\r\nThis year also had Marcus Fabius as dictator, not by reason of any\r\nterror of war, but in order that the Licinian law should not be observed\r\nat the consular elections. Quintus Servilius was attached to the\r\ndictator as master of the horse. Nor yet did the dictatorship render\r\nthat combination of the senators more effectual at the consular\r\nelections, than it had proved at that of the censors.\r\n\r\n23. Marcus Popillius Lænas was chosen consul on the part of the commons,\r\nLucius Cornelius Scipio on that of the patricians. Fortune even rendered\r\nthe plebeian consul more distinguished; for when news was brought that a\r\nvast army of the Gauls had pitched their camp in the Latin territory,\r\nScipio being attacked with a serious fit of illness, the Gallic war was\r\nintrusted out of course to Popillius. He having raised an army with\r\ngreat energy, after he had ordered the younger citizens to assemble in\r\narms outside the Capuan gate, and the quæstors to carry the standards\r\nfrom the treasury to the same place, having completed four legions, he\r\ngave the surplus of the men to the prætor Publius Valerius Publicola,\r\nrecommending to the senate to raise another army, which might be a\r\nreserve to the state against the sudden contingencies of war. He\r\nhimself, after sufficiently preparing and arranging every thing,\r\nproceeds towards the enemy; and in order to ascertain their strength\r\nbefore he should hazard a decisive action, he commenced drawing an\r\nintrenchment on a hill, the nearest he could select to the camp of the\r\nGauls. They being a fierce race and of an eager turn for fighting, when,\r\non descrying the standards of the Romans at a distance, they drew out\r\ntheir forces, as expecting to commence the battle forthwith, when they\r\nperceived that neither the opposite army descended into the plain, and\r\nthat the Romans were protected both by the height of the ground and also\r\nby the entrenchments, supposing that they were dismayed with fear, and\r\nalso more exposed to attack, because they were intent on the work, they\r\nadvance with a furious shout. On the side of the Romans neither the\r\nworks were interrupted, (it was the triarii who were employed at them,)\r\nbut the battle was commenced by the hastati and the principes, who stood\r\nin front of the workmen armed and prepared for the fight. Besides their\r\nown valour, the higher ground aided them, so that all the spears and\r\njavelins did not fall ineffectual, as when thrown on the same level, (as\r\nis generally the case,) but being steadied by their own weight they took\r\neffect; and the Gauls weighed down by the weapons, with which they had\r\ntheir bodies transfixed, or their shields rendered too cumbrous by those\r\nsticking in them. When they advanced almost up the steep at a run,\r\nbecoming irresolute, they at first halted; then when the very delay\r\nshook the courage of the one party, and raised that of the enemy, being\r\nthen pushed backwards they fell one upon the other, and produced a\r\ncarnage among themselves more shocking than the carnage [caused by the\r\nenemy]. For more were crushed by the precipitate rout, than there were\r\nslain by the sword.\r\n\r\n24. Nor as yet was the victory decided in favour of the Romans; another\r\ndifficulty still was remaining for them after they had descended into\r\nthe plain; for the great numbers of the Gauls being such as to prevent\r\nall feeling of such a disaster, raised up fresh troops against the\r\nvictorious enemy, as if a new army rose up once more. And the Romans\r\nstood still, suppressing their ardour; both because the struggle had to\r\nbe undergone a second time by them wearied as they were, and the consul,\r\nhaving his left arm well nigh transfixed with a javelin, whilst he\r\nexposed himself incautiously in the van, had retired for a short time\r\nfrom the field. And now, by the delay, the victory was on the point of\r\nbeing relinquished, when the consul, having had his wound tied up,\r\nriding back to the van, cries out, \"Soldiers, why do you stand? You have\r\nnot to do with a Latin or Sabine enemy, whom, when you have vanquished\r\nby your arms, from an enemy you may make an ally; against brutes we have\r\ndrawn our swords. Their blood must be drawn or ours given to them. You\r\nhave repulsed them from your camp, you have driven them headlong down\r\nthe valley, you stand on the prostrated bodies of your foes. Fill the\r\nplains with the same carnage as you have filled the mountains; do not\r\nwait till they fly, you standing still; your standards must be advanced,\r\nyou must proceed against the enemy.\" Roused again by these\r\nexhortations, they drive back from their ground the foremost companies\r\nof the Gauls, and by forming wedges, they break through the centre of\r\ntheir body. By these means, the enemy being disunited, as being now\r\nwithout regular command, or subordination of officers, they turn their\r\nviolence against their own; and being dispersed through the plains, and\r\ncarried beyond their own camp in their precipitate flight, they make for\r\nthe citadel of Alba, which met their eyes as the most elevated among\r\nhills of equal altitude. The consul, not pursuing them beyond the camp,\r\nbecause the wound weakened him, and he was unwilling to expose his\r\nwearied army to hills occupied by the enemy, bestowed the entire plunder\r\nof the camp on the soldiers, and led back his army, victorious and\r\nenriched with the Gallic spoils, to Rome. The consul's wound occasioned\r\na delay of the triumph, and the same cause made the senate wish for a\r\ndictator, that there might be some one who, the consuls being both sick,\r\nshould hold the elections. Lucius Furius Camillus being nominated\r\ndictator, Publius Cornelius Scipio being attached as master of the\r\nhorse, restored to the patricians their former possession of the\r\nconsulship. He himself being, for that service, elected consul, had\r\nAppius Claudius Crassus named as his colleague.\r\n\r\n25. Before the new consuls entered on their office, a triumph was\r\ncelebrated by Popillius over the Gauls amid the great applause of the\r\ncommons; and they, in a low voice, frequently asked one another, whether\r\nany one was dissatisfied with a plebeian consul. At the same time they\r\nfound fault with the dictator, who had obtained the consulship as a\r\nbribe for having infringed the Licinian law, more dishonourable for the\r\nprivate ambition [evinced] thereby than for the injury inflicted on the\r\npublic, so that, when dictator, he might have himself appointed consul.\r\nThe year was remarkable for many and various commotions. The Gauls\r\n[descending] from the Alban mountains, because they were unable to\r\nendure the severity of the winter, straggling through the plains and the\r\nparts adjoining the sea, committed devastations. The sea was infested by\r\nfleets of the Greeks; and the borders of the Antian shore, and the mouth\r\nof the Tiber; so that the maritime plunderers, encountering those on\r\nland, fought on one occasion an obstinate fight, and separated, the\r\nGauls to their camp, the Greeks back to their ships, doubting whether\r\nthey should consider themselves as vanquished or victors. Among these\r\nthe greatest alarm arose at the circumstance, that assemblies of the\r\nLatin states were held at the grove of Ferentina; and an unequivocal\r\nanswer was given to the Romans on their ordering soldiers from them,\r\n\"that they should cease to issue their orders to those of whose\r\nassistance they stood in need: that the Latins would take up arms in\r\ndefence of their own liberty, rather than for the dominion of others.\"\r\nThe senate becoming uneasy at the defection of their allies, whilst two\r\nforeign wars existed at the same time, when they perceived that those\r\nwhom fidelity had not restrained, should be restrained by fear, ordered\r\nthe consuls to exert to the utmost the energies of their authority in\r\nholding a levy. For that they should depend on an army of their\r\ncountrymen, since their allies were deserting them. Ten legions are said\r\nto have been levied, consisting each of four thousand two hundred\r\ninfantry and three hundred horse. Such a newly-raised army, if any\r\nforeign force should assail, the present power of the Roman people,\r\nwhich is scarcely confined within the whole world, could not easily\r\nraise now, if concentrated upon one point: so true it is, we have\r\nimproved in those particulars only about which we are solicitous, riches\r\nand luxury. Among the other distressing events of this year, Appius\r\nClaudius, one of the consuls, dies in the midst of the preparations for\r\nthe war; and the whole direction of affairs devolved on Camillus; over\r\nwhom, the only consul, it did not appear seemly that a dictator should\r\nbe appointed, either in consideration of his high character, which\r\nshould not be made subordinate to the dictatorship, or on account of the\r\nauspicious omen of his surname with respect to a Gallic war. The consul,\r\nthen, having stationed two legions to protect the city, and divided the\r\nremaining eight with the prætor Lucius Pinarius, mindful of his father's\r\nvalour, selects the Gallic war for himself without any appeal to lots:\r\nthe prætor he commanded to protect the sea-coast, and to drive the\r\nGreeks from the shore. And after he had marched down into the Pomptine\r\nterritory, because he neither wished to engage on the level ground, no\r\ncircumstance rendering it necessary, and he considered that the enemy\r\nwere sufficiently subdued, by preventing from plunder persons whom\r\nnecessity obliged to live on what was so obtained, he selected a\r\nsuitable place for a fixed encampment.\r\n\r\n26. Where when they were spending the time in quiet in their quarters, a\r\nGaul, remarkable for his size and the appearance of his arms, came\r\nforward; and striking his shield with his spear, after he had procured\r\nsilence, through an interpreter he challenged any one of the Romans to\r\ncontend with him with the sword. There was a tribune of the soldiers, a\r\nyoung man, Marcus Valerius, who considering himself not less worthy of\r\nthat distinction than Titus Manlius, having first ascertained the\r\nconsul's pleasure, advanced fully armed into the middle space. The human\r\ncontest was rendered less remarkable by reason of the interposition of\r\nthe divine power. For just as the Roman was commencing the encounter, a\r\ncrow settled suddenly on his helmet, facing the enemy, which, as an\r\naugury sent from heaven, the tribune at first received with pleasure.\r\nThen he prayed that whatever god or goddess had sent him the auspicious\r\nbird, would willingly and kindly aid him. Wondrous to relate, the bird\r\nnot only kept the place it had once taken, but as often as the encounter\r\nwas renewed, raising itself on its wings, it attacked the face and eyes\r\nof the foe with its beak and talons, until Valerius slays him, terrified\r\nat the sight of such a prodigy, and confounded both in his vision and\r\nunderstanding. The crow soaring out of sight makes towards the east.\r\nHitherto the advanced guards on both sides remained quiet. When the\r\ntribune began to strip the body of the slain enemy, neither the Gauls\r\nany longer confined themselves to their post, and the Romans began to\r\nrun to their successful champion with still greater speed. There a\r\nscuffle taking place around the body of the prostrate Gaul, a desperate\r\nfight is stirred up. And now the contest is carried on not by the\r\ncompanies of the nearest posts, but by the legions pouring out from both\r\nsides. The soldiers exulting in the victory of the tribune, and also at\r\nsuch favour and attention from the gods, are commanded by Camillus to\r\nadvance against the enemy: and he, pointing to the tribune distinguished\r\nby the spoils, \"Soldiers,\" said he, \"imitate this man; and around their\r\nfallen leader strew heaps of Gauls.\" Gods and men assisted at that\r\nfight; and the struggle was carried on against the Gauls with a fury by\r\nno means equivocal in its result, so thoroughly were both armies\r\nimpressed with the respective success of the two soldiers, between whom\r\nthe single combat had taken place. Among the first party, whose\r\nencounter had called out the others, there was a desperate encounter:\r\nthe rest of the soldiery, before they came within throw of a weapon,\r\nturned their backs. At first they were dispersed through the Volscians\r\nand the Falernian territory; thence they made for Apulia and the upper\r\nsea. The consul, calling an assembly, after heaping praises on the\r\ntribune, bestows on him ten oxen and a golden crown. He himself, being\r\ncommanded by the senate to take charge of the maritime war, joined his\r\ncamp to that of the prætor. There because matters seemed to be delayed\r\nby the dastardly conduct of the Greeks, who did not venture into the\r\nfield, with the approbation of the senate, he nominated Titus Manlius\r\nTorquatus dictator. The dictator, after appointing Aulus Cornelius\r\nCossus his master of the horse, held the consular elections, and with\r\nthe greatest applause of the people he returned Marcus Valerius Corvus\r\n(for that was his surname from thenceforth) as consul, though absent,\r\nthe rival of his own glory, then three and twenty years of age. As\r\ncolleague to Corvus, Marcus Popillius Lænas, a plebeian, was assigned to\r\nbe consul for the fourth time. Nothing memorable occurred between\r\nCamillus and the Greeks; neither the one were warriors by land, nor the\r\nRomans by sea. At length, when they were repelled from the shore, among\r\nother things necessary for use, water also failing, they abandoned\r\nItaly. To what state or what nation that fleet belonged, there is\r\nnothing certain. I would be most inclined to think that they belonged to\r\nthe tyrants of Sicily; for the farther Greece, being at that time\r\nwearied by intestine war, was now in dread of the power of the\r\nMacedonians.\r\n\r\n27. The armies being disbanded, whilst there was both peace abroad, and\r\ntranquillity at home by reason of the concord of the different orders,\r\nlest matters might be too happy, a pestilence having attacked the state,\r\ncompelled the senate to order the decemvirs to inspect the Sibylline\r\nbooks, and by their suggestion a lectisternium took place. The same year\r\na colony was led to Satricum by the Antians, and the city, which the\r\nLatins had demolished, was rebuilt. And a treaty was concluded at Rome\r\nwith the Carthaginian ambassadors, they having come to request\r\nfriendship and an alliance. The same tranquillity continued at home and\r\nabroad, during the consulate of Titus Manlius Torquatus and Caius\r\nPlautius. Only the interest of money from twelve was reduced to six per\r\ncent; and the payment of the debts was adjusted into equal portions of\r\nthree years, on condition that the fourth payment should be made at the\r\npresent time. And then also, though a portion of the commons were\r\ndistressed, still public credit engrossed the attention of the senate in\r\npreference to the difficulties of private individuals. Their\r\ncircumstances were relieved most effectually, because a cessation was\r\nintroduced of the taxes and levy. On the third year after Satricum was\r\nrebuilt by the Volscians, Marcus Valerius Corvus having been elected\r\nconsul for the second time with Caius Poetelius, when news had been\r\nbrought from Latium, that ambassadors from Antium were going round the\r\nstates of the Latins to excite a war, being ordered to attack the\r\nVolscians, before greater numbers of the enemy should be assembled,\r\nproceeds to Satricum with his army ready for action. And when the\r\nAntians and other Volscians met him, their forces being previously\r\nprepared, in case any movement should be made on the part of Rome, no\r\ndelay of engaging took place between the two parties incensed with long\r\npent-up hate. The Volscians, a nation more spirited to renew hostilities\r\nthan to carry on war, being defeated in the fight, make for the walls of\r\nSatricum in a precipitate flight; and their reliance in their walls not\r\nbeing sufficiently strong, when the city, encompassed by a continuous\r\nline of troops, was now on the point of being taken by scalade, they\r\nsurrendered to the number of four thousand soldiers, besides the unarmed\r\nmultitude. The town was demolished and burnt; only they kept the fire\r\nfrom the temple of Mother Matuta. The entire plunder was given up to the\r\nsoldiers. The four thousand who had surrendered were considered\r\nexclusive of the spoil; these the consul when triumphing drove before\r\nhis chariot in chains; afterwards by selling them he brought a great sum\r\nof money into the treasury. There are some who state that this body of\r\ncaptives consisted of slaves; and this is more probable than that\r\npersons who had surrendered were exposed to sale.\r\n\r\n28. Marcus Fabius Dorso and Servius Sulpicius Camerinus succeeded these\r\nconsuls. After this the Auruncan war commenced in consequence of a\r\nsudden attempt at depredation: and through fear lest this act of one\r\nstate might be the concerted scheme of the whole Latin nation, Lucius\r\nFurius being created dictator, as if against all Latium already in\r\narms, nominated Cneius Manlius Capitolinus his master of the horse. And\r\nwhen, a suspension of public business being proclaimed, (a measure\r\nusually adopted during great alarms,) the levy was held without\r\nexemptions, the legions were led against the Auruncans with all possible\r\nexpedition. The spirit of freebooters rather than of enemies was found\r\nthere. They were vanquished therefore in the first encounter. However\r\nthe dictator, both because they had commenced hostilities without\r\nprovocation, and presented themselves to the contest without reluctance,\r\nconsidering that the aid of the gods should also be engaged, vowed a\r\ntemple to Juno Moneta in the heat of the battle, and when he returned\r\nvictorious to Rome, obliged by his vow, he resigned his dictatorship.\r\nThe senate ordered duumvirs to be appointed to have the temple built\r\nsuitably to the grandeur of the Roman people; the site destined for it\r\nwas in the citadel, where the ground was on which the house of Marcus\r\nManlius Capitolinus had stood. The consuls, having employed the\r\ndictator's army for the Volscian war, took Sora from the enemy, having\r\nattacked them by surprise. The temple of Moneta is dedicated the year\r\nafter it had been vowed, Caius Marcius Rutilus being consul for the\r\nthird time, and Titus Manlius Torquatus for the second time. A prodigy\r\nimmediately followed the dedication, similar to the ancient one of the\r\nAlban mount. For it both rained stones, and during the day night seemed\r\nto be spread [over the sky]; and on the books being inspected, the state\r\nbeing filled with religious scruples, it was resolved by the senate that\r\na dictator should be nominated for the purpose of regulating the\r\nceremonies. Publius Valerius Publicola was nominated; Quintus Fabius\r\nAmbustus was assigned to him as master of the horse. It was determined\r\nthat not only the tribes, but the neighbouring states also should offer\r\nsupplications: and a certain order was appointed for them on what day\r\neach should offer supplication. Severe sentences of the people are said\r\nto have been passed on that year against usurers, for whom a day of\r\ntrial had been appointed by the ædiles. Matters came to an interregnum,\r\nthere being no particular reason on record. After the interregnum, both\r\nthe consuls were elected from the patricians, Marcus Valerius Corvus a\r\nthird time, and Aulus Cornelius Cossus, so that it would seem that such\r\nwas the end aimed at.\r\n\r\n29. Henceforward shall be recorded wars of greater importance, both by\r\nthe strength of the belligerent powers, by the distance of the\r\ncountries, or the length of time during which they were carried on. For\r\nin that year arms were taken up against the Samnites, a nation powerful\r\nboth in wealth and in arms. Pyrrhus followed as an enemy the war of the\r\nSamnites carried on with various success, the Carthaginians followed\r\nPyrrhus. How great a mass of events! How often have extreme dangers been\r\nencountered, that the empire might be raised to its present magnitude,\r\nwhich is now scarcely sustained! But the cause of the war between the\r\nSamnites and Romans, as they had been joined in alliance and friendship,\r\ncame from without; it originated not among themselves. After the\r\nSamnites had unjustly taken up arms, because they had the advantage in\r\nstrength, against the Sidicinians, the weaker party being obliged to\r\nhave recourse to the aid of the more powerful, unite themselves to the\r\nCampanians. As the Campanians brought to the relief of their allies\r\nrather a name than strength, enervated as they were by luxury, they were\r\nbeaten in the Sidicinian territory by men who were inured to the use of\r\narms, and then brought on themselves the entire burthen of the war. For\r\nthe Samnites, taking no further notice of the Sidicinians, having\r\nattacked the Campanians as being the chief of the neighbouring states,\r\nfrom whom the victory might be equally easy, and a greater share of\r\nspoil and glory, after they had secured Tifata, a ridge of hills hanging\r\nover Capua, with a strong garrison, they march down from thence with\r\ntheir army formed in a square into the plain which lies between Capua\r\nand Tifata. There a second battle was fought; and the Campanians, after\r\nan unsuccessful fight, being driven within their walls, when the flower\r\nof their youth being cut down, no hope was nigh at hand, they were\r\nobliged to sue for aid from the Romans.\r\n\r\n30. Their ambassadors, being introduced into the senate, spoke as near\r\nas possible to this purport: \"Conscript fathers, the Campanian state has\r\nsent us to you, to solicit from you friendship for ever, and present\r\naid, which if we had solicited whilst our affairs were prosperous, as it\r\nwould have commenced more readily, so would it have been bound by a\r\nweaker tie. For then, as we should have recollected that we entered into\r\nfriendship on equal terms, we might be equally friendly as now, but\r\nless submissive and compliant with your wishes. Now, won over by your\r\ncompassion for us, and defended by your aid in our critical\r\ncircumstances, it is incumbent on us that we show our sense also of the\r\nkindness received; lest we should seem ungrateful, and undeserving of\r\naid from either god or man. Nor, indeed, do I think that because the\r\nSamnites first became your allies and friends, such a circumstance is\r\nsufficient to prevent our being admitted into friendship; but merely\r\nshows that they excel us in priority and in the degree of honour; for no\r\nprovision has been made in your treaty with the Samnites that you should\r\nnot form any new treaties. It has ever been with you a sufficient title\r\nto your friendship, that he who sought it desired to be a friend of\r\nyours. We, Campanians, though our present state forbids us to speak in\r\nhigh terms, not yielding to any state save you in the extent of our\r\ncity, or in the fertility of our land, come into friendship with you, no\r\ninconsiderable accession in my opinion to your flourishing condition. We\r\nshall be in the rear of the Æquans and Volscians, the eternal enemies of\r\nthis city, whenever they may stir; and whatever ye shall be the first to\r\nperform in defence of our safety, the same shall we ever do in defence\r\nof your empire and glory. Those nations which lie between us and you\r\nbeing reduced, which both your bravery and good fortune makes it certain\r\nwill soon be the case, you will then have an uninterrupted empire\r\nextending even to us. It is distressing and painful, what our condition\r\nobliges us to confess. Conscript fathers, matters are come to this, that\r\nwe Campanians must be the property either of friends or enemies. If you\r\ndefend us, yours; if you desert us, we shall be the property of the\r\nSamnites. Consider, then, whether you would rather that Capua and all\r\nCampania should be added to your power or to that of the Samnites.\r\nRomans, it is surely but just, that your compassion and your aid should\r\nlie open to all men; to those, however, chiefly, who, whilst they afford\r\nit beyond their means to others imploring aid, have themselves been\r\ninvolved in this distress. Although we fought nominally for the\r\nSidicinians, in reality for ourselves, when we saw a neighbouring state\r\nassailed by the nefarious plunder of the Samnites; and after the\r\nSidicinians had been consumed, we saw that the conflagration would pass\r\nover to ourselves. For the Samnites do not come to attack us, because\r\nthey resent an injury received, but because they are glad that a pretext\r\nhas been presented to them. If this were the gratification of their\r\nresentment, and not an occasion for satiating their ambition, was it not\r\nsufficient that they cut down our legions once in the Sidicinian\r\nterritory, a second time in Campania itself? What sort of resentment\r\nmust that be, which the blood shed in two pitched battles cannot\r\nsatiate? To this add the laying waste of our lands; the spoil of men and\r\ncattle driven away, the burning and ruin of our country-houses, every\r\nthing destroyed by fire and sword. Could not resentment be satisfied\r\nwith this? But ambition must be satiated. That hurries them on to\r\nbesiege Capua. They either wish to destroy that most beautiful city, or\r\nto possess it themselves. But, Romans, do you take possession of it in\r\nyour kindness, rather than suffer them to hold it by injustice. I am not\r\naddressing a people who decline just wars; but still, if you make but a\r\nshow of your aid, I do not think that you will have occasion for war.\r\nThe contempt of the Samnites has just reached to us; it soars not\r\nhigher. Accordingly, Romans, we may be protected even by the shadow of\r\nyour aid: whatever after this we shall possess, whatever we ourselves\r\nshall be, determined to consider all that as yours. For you the\r\nCampanian field shall be ploughed; for you the city of Capua shall be\r\nmade populous; you shall be to us in the light of founders, parents, ay,\r\neven immortal gods. There shall be no colony of your own which shall\r\nsurpass us in attachment and loyalty to you. Grant to the Campanians,\r\nconscript fathers, your nod, and your irresistible favour, and bid us\r\nhope that Capua will be safe. With what crowds of persons of all classes\r\nattending us do you suppose that we set out from thence--how, think you,\r\ndid we leave every place full of vows and tears? In what a state of\r\nexpectation do you suppose that the senate are, the Campanian nation,\r\nour wives and our children? I am certain that the entire multitude are\r\nstanding at the gates, looking forward to the road that leads from\r\nhence, anxious as to what answer you may order us, conscript fathers, to\r\nbring back to them, in their solicitude and suspense of mind. One kind\r\nof answer may bring them safety, victory, light, and liberty--what the\r\nother may, I feel horror to think. Determine therefore about us, as\r\nabout persons who will be your future friends and allies, or as persons\r\nwho are to have no existence any where.\"\r\n\r\n31. The ambassadors then withdrawing, after the senate had been\r\nconsulted, though to a great many, their city the greatest and\r\nwealthiest in Italy, their land the most fertile, and situated near the\r\nsea, seemed likely to prove a granary to the Roman people for all\r\nvarieties of provision; still the faith of their engagements was more\r\nregarded than such great advantages, and the consul, by the direction of\r\nthe senate, answered as follows: \"Campanians, the senate considers you\r\ndeserving of aid. But it is meet that friendship be so established with\r\nyou, that no prior friendship and alliance be violated. The Samnites are\r\nunited in a treaty with us. Therefore we refuse you arms against the\r\nSamnites, which would be a violation of duty to the gods first, and then\r\nto men. We will, as divine and human law requires, send ambassadors to\r\nour allies and friends to entreat that no violence be committed against\r\nyou?\" To this the chief of the embassy replied, (for such were the\r\ninstructions they had brought from home,) \"Since you are not willing to\r\ndefend by just force our possessions against violence and injustice, at\r\nleast you will defend your own. Wherefore, conscript fathers, we\r\nsurrender the Campanian people, and the city of Capua, their lands, the\r\ntemples of the gods, all things divine and human, into your jurisdiction\r\nand that of the Roman people; whatever we shall suffer henceforth, being\r\ndetermined to suffer as men who have surrendered to you.\" On these\r\nwords, all extending their hands towards the consuls, bathed in tears\r\nthey fell prostrate in the porch of the senate-house. The fathers,\r\naffected at the vicissitude of human greatness, seeing that a nation\r\nabounding in wealth, noted for luxury and pride, from which a little\r\ntime since their neighbours had solicited assistance, was now so broken\r\nin spirit, as to give up themselves and all they possessed into the\r\npower of others; moreover, their honour also seemed to be involved in\r\nnot betraying those who had surrendered, nor did they consider that the\r\npeople of the Samnites would act fairly, if they should attack a\r\nterritory and a city which had become the property of the Roman people\r\nby a surrender. It was resolved therefore, that ambassadors should be\r\nsent forthwith to the Samnites; instructions were given \"that they\r\nshould lay before the Samnites the entreaties of the Campanians, the\r\nanswer of the senate duly mindful of the friendship of the Samnites, and\r\nfinally the surrender that had been concluded. That they requested, in\r\nconsideration of the friendship and alliance subsisting between them,\r\nthat they would spare their subjects; and that they would not carry\r\nhostilities into that territory which had become the property of the\r\nRoman people. If by gentle measures they did not succeed, that they\r\nshould denounce to the Samnites in the name of the senate and Roman\r\npeople, to withhold their arms from the city of Capua and the Campanian\r\nterritory.\" When the ambassadors urged these matters in the assembly of\r\nthe Samnites, so fierce an answer was returned, that they not only said\r\nthat they would prosecute that war, but their magistrates, having gone\r\nout of the senate-house, in the very presence of the ambassadors,\r\nsummoned the prefects of the cohorts; and with a distinct voice\r\ncommanded them, to proceed forthwith into the Campanian territory, in\r\norder to plunder it.\r\n\r\n32. The result of this embassy being reported at Rome, the care of all\r\nother concerns being laid aside, the senate, having despatched heralds\r\nto demand satisfaction, and, because this was not complied with, war\r\nbeing proclaimed in the usual way, they decreed that the matter should\r\nbe submitted to the people at the very earliest opportunity; and both\r\nthe consuls having set out from the city by order of the people with two\r\narmies, Valerius into Campania, Cornelius into Samnium, the former\r\npitches his camp at Mount Gaurus, the latter at Saticula. The legions of\r\nthe Samnites met with Valerius first; for they thought that the whole\r\nweight of the war would incline to that side. At the same time\r\nresentment stimulated them against the Campanians, that they should be\r\nso ready at one time to lend aid, at another to call in aid against\r\nthem. But as soon as they beheld the Roman camp, they fiercely demanded\r\nthe signal each from his leader; they maintained that the Roman would\r\nbring aid to the Campanian with the same fate with which the Campanian\r\nhad done to the Sidicinian. Valerius, having delayed for a few days in\r\nslight skirmishes for the purpose of making trial of the enemy,\r\ndisplayed the signal for battle, exhorting his men in few words \"not to\r\nlet the new war or the new enemy terrify them. In proportion as they\r\nshould carry their arms to a greater distance from the city, the more\r\nand more unwarlike should the nation prove to be against whom they\r\nshould proceed. That they should not estimate the valour of the Samnites\r\nby the defeats of the Sidicinians and Campanians. Let the combatants be\r\nof what kind they may be, that it was necessary that one side should be\r\nvanquished. That as for the Campanians indeed, they were undoubtedly\r\nvanquished more by circumstances flowing from excessive luxury and by\r\ntheir own want of energy than by the bravery of the enemy. What were the\r\ntwo successful wars of the Samnites, during so many ages, against so\r\nmany glorious exploits of the Roman people, who counted almost more\r\ntriumphs than years since the building of their city? who held subdued\r\nby their arms all the states around them, the Sabines, Etruria, the\r\nLatins, Hernicians, Æquans, Volscians, Auruncans? who eventually drove\r\nby flight into the sea, and into their ships, the Gauls, after\r\nslaughtering them in so many engagements? That soldiers ought both to\r\nenter the field relying on their national military renown, and on their\r\nown valour, and also to consider under whose command and auspices the\r\nbattle is to be fought; whether he be one which is to be listened to as\r\na pompous exhorter, bold merely in words, unacquainted with military\r\nlabours, or one who knows how to wield arms himself also, to advance\r\nbefore the standards, and to show himself in the midst of the danger. My\r\nacts, not my words merely, I wish you to follow; and to seek from me not\r\nmilitary orders only, but example also. It was not by intrigues merely,\r\nnor by cabals usual among the nobles, but by this right hand, I procured\r\nfor myself three consulships, and the highest eulogies. There was a time\r\nwhen this could be said; [no wonder,] for you were a patrician, and\r\nsprung from the liberators of your country; and that family of yours had\r\nthe consulship the same year that the city had consuls. Now the\r\nconsulship lies open in common to us patricians and to you plebeians;\r\nnor is it, as formerly, the prize of birth, but of valour. Look forward,\r\ntherefore, soldiers, to even the highest honour. Though you, as men,\r\nhave, with the approbation of the gods, given me this new surname of\r\nCorvus, the ancient surname of our family, Publicolæ, has not been\r\nerased from my memory. I ever do and ever have cultivated the good will\r\nof the Roman commons abroad and at home, as a private man and in public\r\noffices, high and low, as tribune equally as when consul, with the same\r\nundeviating line of conduct through all my successive consulships. Now,\r\nwith respect to that which is at hand, with the aid of the gods, join\r\nwith me in seeking a new and complete triumph over the Samnites.\"\r\n\r\n33. Never was a general on a more familiar footing with his soldiers, by\r\nhis performing all the duties among the lowest of the soldiers without\r\nreluctance. Moreover in the military sports, wherein equals vie with\r\ntheir equals in contests of swiftness and strength, affable and\r\ncondescending, he conquered and was conquered with the same countenance;\r\nnor did he spurn any competitor who should offer; in his acts kind\r\naccording to the occasion; in his conversation no less mindful of the\r\nease of others than of his own dignity; and, a thing than which nothing\r\nis more agreeable to the people, he administered his offices by the same\r\nline of conduct by which he had gained them. The whole army therefore,\r\ncheering the exhortation of their leader with the utmost alacrity, march\r\nforth from the camp. The battle commenced with equal hopes and equal\r\nstrength on both sides, as much as any battle ever did, with confidence\r\nin themselves, and without contempt of their enemies. Their recent\r\nexploits and their double victory a few days before, increased the\r\nspirits of the Samnites on the other side; the glories of four hundred\r\nyears and victory coeval with the building of their city [had the same\r\neffect] on the Romans; to both sides, however, the circumstance of the\r\nenemy being a new one gave additional anxiety. The battle was a proof\r\nwhat spirits they possessed; for they maintained the conflict in such a\r\nmanner, that, for a considerable time, the armies inclined to neither\r\nside. Then the consul, thinking that some confusion should be caused\r\namong them, since they could not be overpowered by force, endeavours to\r\ndisorder their foremost battalions by a charge of cavalry. And when he\r\nsaw them wheel their troops within a narrow compass in fruitless\r\ndisorder, and that they could not open a passage to the enemy, riding\r\nback to the van of the legions, after leaping from his horse, he says,\r\n\"Soldiers, this is the task for us infantry; come on, as ye shall see me\r\nmaking way with my sword, in whatever direction I shall advance into the\r\nenemy's line, so let each man, with all his might, beat down those who\r\noppose him. All those places, where their erected spears now glitter,\r\nyou shall see cleared by widely-extended slaughter.\" He had uttered\r\nthese words, when the cavalry by order of the consul turn to the wings,\r\nand open a passage for the legions to the centre of the line. First of\r\nall, the consul attacks the enemy, and slays him whom he happened to\r\nengage. Those on the right and left, fired at this sight, commence a\r\ndreadful fight, each with the foe opposite him. The Samnites obstinately\r\nstand their ground, though they receive more wounds than they inflict.\r\nThe battle had now lasted for a considerable time, great slaughter\r\noccurred around the standards of the Samnites; in no part was there a\r\nflight, so firmly had they made up their minds to be vanquished by death\r\nalone. Wherefore the Romans, when they perceived their strength to relax\r\nby fatigue, and but a small part of the day still remained, fired with\r\nfury, rush upon the enemy. Then for the first time it appeared that they\r\nwere giving ground, and that the matter was inclining to a flight; then\r\nthe Samnites were taken, some slain; nor would many have survived, had\r\nnot night terminated the victory rather than the battle. Both the Romans\r\nconfessed, that they had never fought with a more determined enemy; and\r\nthe Samnites, on being asked what cause first drove them to fly after\r\nbeing so determined, said, that it was the eyes of the Romans which\r\nseemed to them to flash fire, and their distracted looks, and furious\r\naspect; that more of terror arose from thence, than from any thing else.\r\nWhich terror they confessed not only in the issue of the battle, but in\r\ntheir departure by night. Next day the Romans take possession of the\r\ndeserted camp of the enemy, whither all the Campanians flocked to\r\ncongratulate them.\r\n\r\n34. But this joy was well nigh alloyed by a great loss sustained in\r\nSamnium. For the consul Cornelius, having set out from Saticula,\r\nincautiously led his army into a mountainous tract, passable through a\r\ndeep defile, and beset on all sides by the enemy; nor did he perceive\r\nthe enemy stationed over his head, until a retreat could no longer be\r\nmade with safety. Whilst the Samnites delayed only till he should bring\r\ndown his entire army into the valley; Publius Decius, a tribune of the\r\nsoldiers, espies in the tract a hill higher than the rest, hanging over\r\nthe enemies' camp, rather steep to be ascended by an encumbered army,\r\nnot difficult for such as were lightly armed. He says therefore to the\r\nconsul, greatly alarmed in mind, \"Aulus Cornelius, do you perceive that\r\nelevated point above the enemy? That is the bulwark of our hope and\r\nsafety, if we briskly gain possession of it, which the Samnites in their\r\nblindness have given up. Only give me the first rank and spearmen of one\r\nlegion; when with these I shall have gained the summit, do you proceed\r\nhence free from all apprehension, and save yourself and the army. For\r\nthe enemy, lying beneath us and [exposed thereby] to all our weapons,\r\nwill not be able to stir without destruction to themselves. After that\r\neither the good fortune of the Roman people or our own bravery will\r\nextricate us.\" Being commanded by the consul, he received the body of\r\nmen [required] and proceeds by secret paths through the mountain, nor\r\nwas he observed by the enemy until he approached the place which he was\r\nmaking for. Then, whilst all were struck with astonishment, after he had\r\nattracted the eyes of all to himself, he both afforded the consul time\r\nto draw off his army to more advantageous ground, and he himself was\r\nposted on the top of the hill. The Samnites, whilst they march their\r\nforces now in this direction, now in that, having lost the opportunity\r\nof effecting either object, can neither pursue the consul, unless\r\nthrough the same defile in which they had him a little before exposed to\r\ntheir weapons, nor march up the rising ground over themselves, which had\r\nbeen seized on by Decius. But both their resentment stimulated them more\r\nagainst the latter, who had taken from them the favourable opportunity\r\nof achieving their object, and also the proximity of the place, and the\r\npaucity of the enemy; and one time they would fain surround the hill on\r\nall sides with armed men, so as to cut off Decius from the consul; at\r\nanother time they wished to open a passage, so that they may fall on\r\nthem when they had descended into the defile. Before they had determined\r\non what they should do, night came on them. Decius at first entertained\r\na hope, that he would have to engage them from the higher ground, as\r\nthey ascended against the steep; then surprise took possession of him,\r\nthat they neither commenced the fight, nor if they were deterred from\r\nthat by the unevenness of the ground, that they did not surround him\r\nwith works and a circumvallation. Then summoning the centurions to him,\r\nhe said, \"What ignorance of war and indolence is that? or how did such\r\nmen obtain a victory over the Sidicinians and Campanians? You see that\r\ntheir battalions move to and fro, that sometimes they are collected to\r\none spot, at other times they are drawn out. As for work, no one\r\nattempts it, when we might by this time have been surrounded with a\r\nrampart. Then indeed should we be like to them, if we delay longer here\r\nthan is expedient. Come on, accompany me; that whilst some day light\r\nremains, we may ascertain in what places they put their guards, in what\r\ndirection an escape may lie open from hence.\" All these points he\r\ncarefully observed, clad in a soldier's vest, the centurions whom he\r\ntook with him being also in the attire of common soldiers, lest the\r\nenemy might notice the general going the round.\r\n\r\n35. Then having placed watch-guards, he commands the ticket to be issued\r\nto all the rest, that when the signal had been given by the trumpet of\r\nthe second watch, they should assemble to him in silence fully armed.\r\nWhither when they had assembled in silence according to the orders\r\nissued, \"Soldiers,\" says he, \"this silence is to be observed in\r\nlistening to me, waving the military mode of expressing assent. When I\r\nshall have thoroughly explained my sentiments to you, then such of you\r\nas shall approve the same, will pass over; we will follow that line of\r\nconduct which shall meet the judgment of the majority. Now hear what I\r\nmeditate in mind. The enemy have surrounded you, not brought hither in\r\nflight, nor left behind through cowardice. By valour you seized this\r\nground; by valour you must make your way from it. By coming hither you\r\nhave saved a valuable army of the Roman people; by forcing your way\r\nhence, save yourselves. You have proved yourselves worthy, though few in\r\nnumber, of affording aid to multitudes, whilst you yourselves stand in\r\nneed of aid from no one. You have to do with that enemy, who on\r\nyesterday, through their supineness, availed themselves not of the\r\nfortunate opportunity of destroying our whole army, who did not see this\r\nhill so advantageously situate hanging over their heads, until it was\r\nseized on by us; who with so many thousand men did not prevent us so few\r\nfrom the ascent, and did not surround us with a rampart when in\r\npossession of the ground, though so much of the day still remained. That\r\nenemy which with their eyes open and awake you so baffled, it is\r\nincumbent on you now to beguile, buried, as they are, in sleep; nay, it\r\nis absolutely necessary. For our affairs are in that situation, that I\r\nam rather to point out to you your necessity than to propose advice. For\r\nwhether you are to remain or to depart hence, can no longer be matter of\r\ndeliberation, since, with the exception of your arms, and courage\r\nmindful of those arms, fortune has left you nothing, and we must die of\r\nfamine and thirst, if we are more afraid of the sword than becomes men\r\nand Romans. Therefore our only safety is to sally forth from this and to\r\ndepart. That we must do either by day or by night. But lo! another point\r\nwhich admits of less doubt; for if daylight be waited for, what hope is\r\nthere, that the enemy, who have now encompassed the hill on every side,\r\nas you perceive, with their bodies exposed at disadvantage, will not hem\r\nus in with a continued rampart and ditch? If night then be favourable\r\nfor a sally, as it is, this is undoubtedly the most suitable hour of\r\nnight. You assembled here on the signal of the second watch, a time\r\nwhich buries mortals in the profoundest sleep. You will pass through\r\ntheir bodies lulled to sleep, either in silence unnoticed by them, or\r\nready to strike terror into them, should they perceive you, by a sudden\r\nshout. Only follow me, whom you have followed. The same fortune which\r\nconducted us hither, will I follow. Those of you to whom these measures\r\nseem salutary, come on, pass over to the right.\"\r\n\r\n36. They all passed over, and followed Decius as he proceeded through\r\nthe intervals which lay between the guards. They had now passed the\r\nmiddle of the camp, when a soldier, striding over the bodies of the\r\nwatchmen as they lay asleep, occasioned a noise by striking one of their\r\nshields. When the watchman, being aroused by this, stirred the next one\r\nto him, and those who were awake stirred up others, not knowing whether\r\nthey were friends or foes, whether it was the garrison that sallied\r\nforth or the consul had taken their camp; Decius, having ordered the\r\nsoldiers to raise a shout, as they were no longer unobserved,\r\ndisheartens them by panic whilst still heavy from sleep, by which being\r\nperplexed, they were neither able to take arms briskly, nor make\r\nresistance, nor to pursue them. During the trepidation and confusion of\r\nthe Samnites, the Roman guard, slaying such of the guards as came in\r\ntheir way, reached the consul's camp. A considerable portion of night\r\nstill remained, and things now appeared to be in safety; when Decius\r\nsays, \"Roman soldiers, be honoured for your bravery. Your journey and\r\nreturn ages shall extol. But to behold such bravery light and day are\r\nnecessary; nor do you deserve that silence and night should cover you,\r\nwhilst you return to the camp with such distinguished glory. Here let us\r\nwait in quiet for the daylight.\" His words they obeyed. And as soon as\r\nit was day, a messenger being despatched to the camp to the consul, they\r\nwere aroused from sleep with great joy; and the signal being given by\r\nticket, that those persons returned safe who had exposed their persons\r\nto evident danger for the preservation of all, rushing out each most\r\nanxiously to meet them, they applaud them, congratulate them, they call\r\nthem singly and collectively their preservers, they give praises and\r\nthanks to the gods, they raise Decius to heaven. This was a sort of camp\r\ntriumph for Decius, who proceeded through the middle of the camp, with\r\nhis guard fully armed, the eyes of all being fixed on him, and all\r\ngiving him equal honour with the consul. When they came to the general's\r\ntent, the consul summons them by sound of trumpet to an assembly; and\r\ncommencing with the well-earned praises of Decius, he adjourned the\r\nassembly on the interposition of Decius himself, who advising the\r\npostponement of every thing else, whilst the occasion was still present,\r\npersuaded the consul to attack the enemy, whilst still in consternation\r\nfrom the panic of the night, and dispersing in separate detachments\r\naround the hill, [adding] that he believed that some who had been sent\r\nout in pursuit of him were straggling through the forest. The legions\r\nwere ordered to take arms; and having departed from the camp, as the\r\nforest was now better known by means of scouts, they are led onwards to\r\nthe enemy through a more open tract. Having unexpectedly attacked the\r\nenemy when off their guard, since the soldiers of the Samnites\r\nstraggling in every direction, most of them unarmed, were not able\r\neither to rally, nor to take arms, nor to betake themselves within the\r\nrampart, they first drive them in a panic into the camp: then they take\r\nthe camp itself, having dislodged the guards. The shout spread around\r\nthe hill; and puts each to flight from their respective posts. Thus a\r\ngreat part yielded to an enemy they had not seen. Those whom the panic\r\nhad driven within the rampart (they amounted to thirty thousand) were\r\nall slain; the camp was plundered.\r\n\r\n37. Matters being thus conducted, the consul, having summoned an\r\nassembly, pronounces a panegyric on Decius, not only that which had been\r\ncommenced on a previous occasion, but as now completed by his recent\r\ndeserts; and besides other military gifts, he presents him with a golden\r\ncrown and one hundred oxen, and with one white one of distinguished\r\nbeauty, richly decorated with gilded horns. The soldiers who had been in\r\nthe guard with him, were presented with a double allowance of corn for\r\never; for the present, with an ox and two vests each. Immediately after\r\nthe consuls' donation, the legions place on the head of Decius a crown\r\nof grass, indicative of their deliverance from a blockade, expressing\r\ntheir approbation of the present with a shout. Decorated with these\r\nemblems, he sacrificed the beautiful ox to Mars; the hundred oxen he\r\nbestowed on the soldiers, who had been with him in the expedition. On\r\nthe same soldiers the legions conferred, each a pound of corn and a pint\r\nof wine; and all these things were performed with great alacrity, with a\r\nmilitary shout, a token of the approbation of all. The third battle was\r\nfought near Suessula, in which the army of the Samnites, having been\r\nrouted by Marcus Valerius, having summoned from home the flower of their\r\nyouth, determined on trying their strength by a final contest. From\r\nSuessula messengers came in great haste to Capua, and from thence\r\nhorsemen in full speed to the consul Valerius, to implore aid. The\r\ntroops were immediately put in motion; and the baggage in the camp being\r\nleft with a strong guard, the army moves on with rapidity; and they\r\nselect at no great distance from the enemy a very narrow spot (as, with\r\nthe exception of their horses, they were unaccompanied by a crowd of\r\ncattle and servants). The army of the Samnites, as if there was to be no\r\ndelay in coming to an engagement, draw up in order of battle; then, when\r\nno one came to meet them, they advance to the enemy's camp in readiness\r\nfor action. There when they saw the soldiers on the rampart, and persons\r\nsent out to reconnoitre in every direction, brought back word into how\r\nnarrow a compass the camp had been contracted, inferring thence the\r\nscanty number of the enemy. The whole army began to exclaim, that the\r\ntrenches ought to be filled up, the rampart to be torn down, and that\r\nthey should force their way into the camp; and by that temerity the war\r\nwould have been soon over, had not the generals restrained the\r\nimpetuosity of the soldiers. However, as their own numbers bore heavily\r\non their supplies, and in consequence, first of their sitting down so\r\nlong at Suessula, and then by the delay of the contest, they were not\r\nfar from a want of provisions, it was determined, whilst the enemy\r\nremained shut up as if through fear, that the soldiers should be led\r\nthrough the country to forage; [supposing] in the mean time, that all\r\nsupplies would fail the Romans also, who having marched in haste, had\r\nbrought with him only as much corn as could be carried on his shoulders\r\namid his arms. The consul, after he had observed the enemy scattered\r\nthrough the country, that the posts were left but insufficiently\r\nattended, having in a few words encouraged his men, leads them on to\r\nbesiege the camp. After he had taken this on the first shout and\r\ncontest, more of the enemy being slain in their tents than at the gates\r\nand rampart, he ordered the captive standards to be collected into one\r\nplace, and having left behind two legions as a guard and protection,\r\nafter giving them strict order that they should abstain from the booty,\r\nuntil he himself should return; having set out with his troops in\r\nregular order, the cavalry who had been sent on driving the dispersed\r\nSamnites as it were by hunting toils, he committed great slaughter among\r\nthem. For in their terror they could neither determine by what signal\r\nthey should collect themselves into a body, whether they should make for\r\nthe camp, or continue their flight to a greater distance. And so great\r\nwas their terror, and so precipitate their flight, that to the number of\r\nforty thousand shields, though by no means were so many slain, and one\r\nhundred and seventy standards, with those which had been taken in the\r\ncamp, were brought to the consul. Then they returned to the enemy's\r\ncamp; and there all the plunder was given up to the soldiers.\r\n\r\n38. The result of this contest obliged the Faliscians, who were on terms\r\nof a truce, to petition for a treaty of alliance from the senate; and\r\ndiverted the Latins, who had their armies already prepared, from the\r\nRoman to a Pelignian war. Nor did the fame of such success confine\r\nitself within the limits of Italy; but the Carthaginians also sent\r\nambassadors to Rome to congratulate them, with an offering of a golden\r\ncrown, to be placed in Jupiter's shrine in the Capitol. Its weight was\r\ntwenty-five pounds. Both consuls triumphed over the Samnites, whilst\r\nDecius followed distinguished with praises and presents, when amid the\r\nrough jesting of the soldiers the name of the tribune was no less\r\ncelebrated than that of the consuls. The embassies of the Campanians and\r\nSuessulans were then heard; and to their entreaties it was granted that\r\na garrison should be sent thither, in order that the incursions of the\r\nSamnites might be repelled. Capua, even then by no means favourable to\r\nmilitary discipline, alienated from the memory of their country the\r\naffections of the soldiers, which were debauched by the supply of\r\npleasures of all kinds; and schemes were being formed in winter-quarters\r\nfor taking away Capua from the Campanians by the same kind of wickedness\r\nas that by which they had taken it from its original possessors: \"and\r\nnot undeservedly would they turn their own example against themselves.\r\nFor why should the Campanians, who were neither able to defend\r\nthemselves nor their possessions, occupy the most fertile land of Italy,\r\nand a city worthy of that land, rather than the victorious army, who had\r\ndriven the Samnites from thence by their sweat and blood? Was it\r\nreasonable that men who had surrendered to them should have the full\r\nenjoyment of that fertile and delightful country; that they, wearied by\r\nmilitary toil, had to struggle in an insalubrious and arid soil around\r\ntheir city, or within the city to suffer the oppressive and exhausting\r\nweight of interest-money daily increasing?\" These schemes agitated in\r\nsecret cabals, and as yet communicated only to a few, were encountered\r\nby the new consul Caius Marcius Rutilus, to whom the province of\r\nCampania had fallen by lot, Quintus Servilius, his colleague, being left\r\nbehind in the city. Accordingly when he was in possession of all these\r\ncircumstances just as they had occurred, having ascertained them through\r\nthe tribunes, matured by years and experience, (for he was consul now\r\nfor the fourth time, and had been dictator and censor,) thinking it the\r\nwisest proceeding to frustrate the violence of the soldiers, by\r\nprolonging their hope of executing their project whenever they might\r\nwish, he spreads the rumour, that the troops were to winter in the same\r\ntowns on the year after also. For they had been cantoned throughout the\r\ncities of Campania, and their plots had spread from Capua to the entire\r\narmy. This abatement being given to the eagerness of their projects, the\r\nmutiny was set at rest for the present.\r\n\r\n39. The consul, having led out his army to the summer campaign,\r\ndetermined, whilst he had the Samnites quiet, to purge the army by\r\nsending away the turbulent men; by telling some that their regular time\r\nhad been served; that others were weighed down by years and debilitated\r\nin bodily vigour. Some were sent away on furloughs, at first\r\nindividuals, then some cohorts also, on the plea that they had wintered\r\nfar from their home and domestic affairs. When different individuals\r\nwere sent to different places under pretence of the business of the\r\nservice, a considerable number were put out of the way; which multitude\r\nthe other consul detained in Rome under different pretences. And first\r\nindeed, not suspecting the artifice, they returned to their homes by no\r\nmeans with reluctance. After they saw that neither those first sent\r\nreturned to their standards, and that scarcely any others, except those\r\nwho had wintered in Campania, and chiefly the fomenters of the mutiny,\r\nwere sent away; at first wonder, and then certain fear entered their\r\nminds, that their schemes had been divulged; \"that now they would have\r\nto suffer trials, discoveries, the secret punishments of individuals,\r\nand the tyrannical and cruel despotism of the consuls and the senate.\r\nThose who were in the camp, discuss these things in secret conferences,\r\nseeing that the sinews of the conspiracy had been got rid of by the\r\nartifice of the consul.\" One cohort, when they were at no great distance\r\nfrom Anxur, posted itself at Lautulæ, in a narrow woody pass between the\r\nsea and the mountains, to intercept those whom the consul was dismissing\r\nunder various pretences (as has been already mentioned). Their body was\r\nnow becoming strong in numbers; nor was any thing wanting to complete\r\nthe form of a regular army, except a leader. Without order, therefore,\r\nthey come into the Alban territory committing depredations, and under\r\nthe hill of Alba Longa, they encompass their camp with a rampart. The\r\nwork here being completed, during the remainder of the day they discuss\r\ntheir different opinions regarding the choice of a commander, not having\r\nsufficient confidence in any of those present. Whom could they invite\r\nout from Rome? What individuals of the patricians or of the commons was\r\nthere, who would either knowingly expose himself to such imminent\r\ndanger, or to whom could the cause of the army, set mad by\r\nill-treatment, be safely committed? On the following day, when the same\r\nsubject of deliberation detained them, some of the straggling marauders\r\nascertained and brought an account, that Titus Quinctius cultivated a\r\nfarm in the Tusculan territory, forgetful of the city and its honours.\r\nThis was a man of patrician family, whose military career, which was\r\npassed with great glory, having been relinquished in consequence of one\r\nof his feet being lamed by a wound, he determined on spending his life\r\nin the country far from ambition and the forum. His name once heard,\r\nthey immediately recognised the man; and with wishes for success,\r\nordered him to be sent for. There was, however, but little hope that he\r\nwould do any thing voluntarily; they resolved on employing force and\r\nintimidation. Accordingly those who had been sent for the purpose,\r\nhaving entered the house in the silence of the night, and surprising\r\nQuinctius overcome in sleep, threatening that there was no alternative,\r\neither authority and honour, or death, in case he resisted, unless he\r\nfollowed, they force him to the camp. Immediately on his arrival he was\r\nstyled general, and whilst he was startled at the strange nature of the\r\nsudden occurrence, they convey to him the ensigns of honour, and bid him\r\nlead them to the city. Then having torn up their standard, more under\r\nthe influence of their own impetuosity than by the command of their\r\ngeneral, they arrive in hostile array at the eighth stone on the road,\r\nwhich is now the Appian; and would have proceeded immediately to the\r\ncity, had they not heard that an army was coming to meet them, and that\r\nMarcus Valerius Corvus was nominated dictator against them, and Lucius\r\nÆmilius Mamercinus master of the horse.\r\n\r\n40. As soon as they came in sight and recognised the arms and standards,\r\ninstantly the recollection of their country softened the resentment of\r\nall. Not yet were they so hardy as to shed the blood of their\r\ncountrymen, nor had they known any but foreign wars, and secession from\r\ntheir own was deemed the extreme of rage. Accordingly now the generals,\r\nnow the soldiers sought a meeting for a negotiation. Quinctius, who was\r\nsatiated with arms [taken up] even in defence of his country, much more\r\nso against it; Corvus, who entertained a warm affection for all his\r\ncountrymen, chiefly the soldiers, and above others, for his own army,\r\nadvanced to a conference. To him, being immediately recognised, silence\r\nwas granted with no less respect by his adversaries, than by his own\r\nparty: he says, \"Soldiers, at my departure from the city, I prayed to\r\nthe immortal gods, your public deities as well as mine, and earnestly\r\nimplored their goodness so, that they would grant me the glory of\r\nestablishing concord among you, not victory over you. There have been\r\nand there will be sufficient opportunities, whence military fame may be\r\nobtained: on this occasion peace should be the object of our wishes.\r\nWhat I earnestly called for from the immortal gods when offering up my\r\nprayers, you have it in your power to grant to me, if you will remember,\r\nthat you have your camp not in Samnium, nor among the Volscians, but on\r\nRoman ground; that those hills which you behold are those of your\r\ncountry, that this is the army of your countrymen; that I am your own\r\nconsul, under whose guidance and auspices ye last year twice defeated\r\nthe legions of the Samnites, twice took their camp by storm. Soldiers, I\r\nam Marcus Valerius Corvus, whose nobility ye have felt by acts of\r\nkindness towards you, not by ill-treatment; the proposer of no\r\ntyrannical law against you, of no harsh decree of the senate; in every\r\npost of command more strict on myself than on you. And if birth, if\r\npersonal merit, if high dignity, if public honours could suggest\r\narrogance to any one, from such ancestors have I been descended, such a\r\nspecimen had I given of myself, at such an age did I attain the\r\nconsulship, that when but twenty-three years old I might have been a\r\nproud consul, even to the patricians, not to the commons only. What act\r\nor saying of mine, when consul, have ye heard of more severe than when\r\nonly tribune? With the same tenor did I administer two successive\r\nconsulships; with the same shall this uncontrollable office, the\r\ndictatorship, be administered. So that I shall be found not more\r\nindulgent to these my own soldiers and the soldiers of my country, than\r\nto you, I shudder to call you so, its enemies. Ye shall therefore draw\r\nthe sword against me, before I draw it against you. On that side the\r\nsignal shall be sounded, on that the shout and onset shall begin, if a\r\nbattle must take place. Determine in your minds, on that which neither\r\nyour fathers nor grandfathers could; neither those who seceded to the\r\nSacred Mount, nor yet those who afterwards posted themselves on the\r\nAventine. Wait till your mothers and wives come out to meet you from the\r\ncity with dishevelled hair, as they did formerly to Coriolanus. At that\r\ntime the legions of the Volscians, because they had a Roman for their\r\nleader, ceased from hostilities; will not ye, a Roman army, desist from\r\nan unnatural war? Titus Quinctius, under whatever circumstances you\r\nstand on that side, whether voluntarily or reluctantly, if there must be\r\nfighting, do you then retire to the rear. With more honour even will you\r\nfly, and turn your back to your countryman, than fight against your\r\ncountry. Now you will stand with propriety and honour among the foremost\r\nto promote peace; and may you be a salutary agent in this conference.\r\nRequire and offer that which is just; though we should admit even unjust\r\nterms, rather than engage in an impious combat with each other.\" Titus\r\nQuinctius, turning to his party with his eyes full of tears, said, \"In\r\nme too, soldiers, if there is any use of me, ye have a better leader for\r\npeace than for war. For that speech just now delivered, not a Volscian,\r\nnor a Samnite expressed, but a Roman: your own consul, your own general,\r\nsoldiers: whose auspices having already experienced for you, do not wish\r\nto experience them against you. The senate had other generals also, who\r\nwould engage you with more animosity; they have selected the one who\r\nwould be most indulgent to you, his own soldiers, in whom as your\r\ngeneral you would have most confidence. Even those who can conquer,\r\ndesire peace: what ought we to desire? Why do we not, renouncing\r\nresentment and hope, those fallacious advisers, resign ourselves and all\r\nour interests to his tried honour?\"\r\n\r\n41. All approving with a shout, Titus Quinctius, advancing before the\r\nstandards, declared that \"the soldiers would be obedient to the\r\ndictator; he entreated that he would espouse the cause of his\r\nunfortunate countrymen, and having espoused it, he would maintain it\r\nwith the same fidelity with which he had wont to administer public\r\naffairs. That for himself individually he made no terms: that he would\r\nfound his hope in nothing else but in his innocence. That provision\r\nshould be made for the soldiers, as provision had been made by the\r\nsenate, once for the commons, a second time for the legions, so that the\r\nsecession should not be visited with punishment.\" The dictator, having\r\nlauded Quinctius, and having bid the others to hope for the best,\r\nreturned back to the city with all speed, and, with the approbation of\r\nthe senate, proposed to the people in the Peteline grove, that the\r\nsecession should not be visited with chastisement on any of the\r\nsoldiers. He also entreated, with their permission, that no one should\r\neither in jest or earnest upbraid any one with that proceeding. A\r\nmilitary devoting law was also passed, that the name of any soldier once\r\nenrolled, should not be erased unless with his own consent; and to the\r\nlaw [a clause] was added that no one, after he had been a tribune of the\r\nsoldiers, should afterwards be a centurion. That demand was made by the\r\nconspirators on account of Publius Salonius; who in alternate years was\r\nboth tribune of the soldiers and first centurion, which they now call\r\n_primi pili_. The soldiers were incensed against him, because he had\r\nalways been opposed to their recent measures, and had fled from Lantulæ,\r\nthat he might have no share in them. Accordingly when this alone was not\r\nobtained from the senate through their regard for Salonius, then\r\nSalonius, conjuring the conscript fathers, that they would not value his\r\npromotion more highly than the concord of the state, prevailed in having\r\nthat also carried. Equally ineffectual was the demand, that some\r\ndeductions should be made from the pay of the cavalry, (they then\r\nreceived triple,) because they had opposed the conspiracy.\r\n\r\n42. Besides these, I find in some writers that Lucius Genucius, tribune\r\nof the commons, proposed to the people, that no one should be allowed to\r\npractise usury; likewise provision was made by other enactments, that no\r\none should fill the same office within ten years; nor hold two offices\r\non the same year; and that it should be allowed that both the consuls\r\nshould be plebeians. If all these concessions were made to the people,\r\nit is evident that the revolt possessed no little strength. In other\r\nannals it is recorded, that Valerius was not appointed dictator, but\r\nthat the entire business was managed by the consuls; and also that that\r\nband of conspirators were driven to arms not before they came to Rome,\r\nbut at Rome; and that it was not on the country-house of Titus\r\nQuinctius, but on the residence of Caius Manlius the assault was made by\r\nnight, and that he was seized by the conspirators to become their\r\nleader: that having proceeded thence to the fourth mile-stone, they\r\nposted themselves in a well-defended place; and that it was not with the\r\nleaders mention of a reconciliation originated; but that suddenly, when\r\nthe armies marched out to battle fully armed, a mutual salutation took\r\nplace; that mixing together the soldiers began to join hands, and to\r\nembrace each other with tears; and that the consuls, on seeing the minds\r\nof the soldiers averse from fighting, made a proposition to the senate\r\nconcerning the re-establishment of concord. So that among ancient\r\nwriters nothing is agreed on, except that there was a mutiny, and that\r\nit was composed. Both the report of this disturbance, and the heavy war\r\nentered into with the Samnites, alienated some states from the Roman\r\nalliance: and besides the treaty of the Latins, which now for a long\r\ntime was not to be depended on, the Privernians also by a sudden\r\nincursion laid waste Norba and Setia, Roman colonies in their\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _The Latins with the Campanians revolt; and ambassadors having been\r\n     sent to the senate, they propose that, if they wished for peace,\r\n     they should elect one of the consuls from among the Latins. Titus\r\n     Manlius, the consul, put his son to death, because he had fought,\r\n     though successfully, against the Latins, contrary to orders. The\r\n     Romans being hard pressed in the battle, Publius Decius, then\r\n     consul with Manlius, devoted himself for the army. The Latins\r\n     surrender. None of the young men came out to meet Manlius on his\r\n     return to the city. Minucia, a vestal virgin, was condemned for\r\n     incest. Several matrons convicted of poisoning. Laws then first\r\n     made against that crime. The Ausonians, Privernians, and\r\n     Palæpolitans subdued. Quintus Publilius the first instance of a\r\n     person continuing in command after the expiration of his office,\r\n     and of a triumph decreed to any person not a consul. Law against\r\n     confinement for debt. Quintus Fabius, master of the horse, fights\r\n     the Samnites with success, contrary to the orders of Lucius\r\n     Papirius, dictator; and, with difficulty, obtains pardon, through\r\n     the intercession of the people. Successful expedition against the\r\n     Samnites._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The consuls now were Caius Plautius a second time, and Lucius Æmilius\r\nMamercinus; when the people of Setia and Norba came to Rome to announce\r\nthe revolt of the Privernians, with complaints of the damages received\r\nby them. News were brought that the army of the Volscians, under the\r\nguidance of the people of Antium, had taken post at Satricum. Both wars\r\nfell by lot to Plautius. He, marching first to Privernum, immediately\r\ncame to an engagement. The enemy were defeated after a slight\r\nresistance: the town was taken, and given back to the Privernians, a\r\nstrong garrison being placed in it: two thirds of their land were taken\r\nfrom them. The victorious army was marched thence to Satricum against\r\nthe Antians; there a desperate battle was fought with great slaughter on\r\nboth sides; and when a storm separated the combatants, hope inclining to\r\nneither side, the Romans, nowise disheartened by this so indecisive an\r\nengagement, prepare for battle against the following day. The\r\nVolscians, reckoning up what men they had lost in battle, had by no\r\nmeans the same spirits to repeat the risk. They went off in the night to\r\nAntium as a vanquished army in the utmost confusion, leaving behind\r\ntheir wounded and a part of their baggage. A vast quantity of arms was\r\nfound, both among the dead bodies of the enemy, and also in the camp.\r\nThese, the consul declared, that he offered up to Mother Lua; and he\r\nlaid waste the enemy's country as far as the sea-coast. The other\r\nconsul, Æmilius, on entering the Sabellan territory, found neither a\r\ncamp of the Samnites nor legions opposed to him. Whilst he laid waste\r\ntheir territories with fire and sword, the ambassadors of the Samnites\r\ncame to him, suing for peace; by whom being referred to the senate,\r\nafter leave to address them was granted, laying aside their ferocious\r\nspirits, they sued for peace for themselves from the Romans, and the\r\nright of waging war against the Sidicinians. Which requests, [they\r\nalleged,] that \"they were the more justified in making, because they had\r\nboth united in friendship with the Roman people, when their affairs were\r\nflourishing, not under circumstances of distress, as the Campanians had\r\ndone, and they were taking up arms against the Sidicinians, ever their\r\nenemies, never the friends of the Roman people; who had neither, as the\r\nSamnites, sought their friendship in time of peace, nor, as the\r\nCampanians, their assistance in time of war, and were neither in\r\nalliance with, nor under subjection to the Roman people.\"\r\n\r\n2. After the prætor Tiberius Æmilius had consulted the senate respecting\r\nthe demands of the Samnites, and the senate voted that the treaty should\r\nbe renewed with them, the prætor returned this answer to the Samnites:\r\n\"That it neither had been the fault of the Roman people that their\r\nfriendship with them was not perpetual; nor was any objection made to\r\nthat friendship being once more re-established, since they themselves\r\nwere now become tired of a war entered into through their own fault.\r\nWith respect to what regarded the Sidicinians, they did not interfere\r\nwith the Samnite nation having the free decision of peace and war.\" The\r\ntreaty being concluded, on their return home, the Roman army was\r\nimmediately withdrawn after they had received a year's pay, and corn for\r\nthree months: for which the consul had stipulated, to grant time for a\r\ntruce, until the ambassadors should return. The Samnites having marched\r\nagainst the Sidicinians with the same forces which they had employed in\r\ntheir war against the Romans, entertained rather sanguine hopes of\r\nbecoming masters of the enemies' citadel. Then the Sidicinians first\r\nbegan to surrender to the Romans. Afterwards, when the senate rejected\r\nthat offer as too late, and as being wrung from them by extreme\r\nnecessity, it was made to the Latins, who were already taking up arms on\r\ntheir own account. Nor did even the Campanians (so much stronger was\r\ntheir recollection of the injuries done them by the Samnites than of the\r\nkindness of the Romans) keep themselves from this quarrel. Out of these\r\nso many states, one vast army, entering the territories of the Samnites\r\nunder the direction of the Latins, committed more damage by depredations\r\nthan by battles; and though the Latins had the advantage in the field,\r\nthey retired out of the enemies' territory without reluctance, that they\r\nmight not be obliged to fight too frequently. This opportunity was\r\nafforded to the Samnites to send ambassadors to Rome. When they appeared\r\nbefore the senate, having complained that they, though now confederates,\r\nwere subjected to the same hardships as those they had suffered as\r\nenemies, solicited, with the humblest entreaties, that \"the Romans would\r\nthink it enough the victory, of which they had deprived the Samnites,\r\nover their Campanian and Sidicinian enemy; that they would not besides\r\nsuffer them to be vanquished by these most dastardly states. That they\r\ncould by their sovereign authority keep the Latins and the Campanians\r\nout of the Samnite territory, if they really were under the dominion of\r\nthe Roman people; but if they rejected their authority, that they might\r\ncompel them by arms.\" To this an equivocal answer was returned, because\r\nit was mortifying to acknowledge, that the Latins were not now in their\r\npower, and they were afraid lest by finding fault they might estrange\r\nthem from their side: that the case of the Campanians was different,\r\nthey having come under their protection, not by treaty but by surrender:\r\naccordingly, that the Campanians, whether they wished or not, should\r\nremain quiet: that in the Latin treaty there was no clause by which they\r\nwere prevented from going to war with whomsoever they pleased.\r\n\r\n3. Which answer, whilst it sent away the Samnites uncertain as to what\r\nconduct they were to think that the Romans would pursue, it further\r\nestranged the Campanians through fear; it rendered the Samnites more\r\npresuming, they considering that there was nothing which the Romans\r\nwould now refuse them. Wherefore, proclaiming frequent meetings under\r\nthe pretext of preparing for war against the Samnites, their leading\r\nmen, in their several deliberations among themselves, secretly fomented\r\nthe plan of a war with Rome. In this war the Campanians too joined\r\nagainst their preservers. But though all their schemes were carefully\r\nconcealed, and they were anxious that their Samnite enemy should be got\r\nrid of in their rear before the Romans should be aroused, yet through\r\nthe agency of some who were attached [to the latter] by private\r\nfriendships and other ties, information of their conspiracy made its way\r\nto Rome, and the consuls being ordered to resign their office before the\r\nusual time, in order that the new consuls might be elected the sooner to\r\nmeet so important a war, a religious scruple entered their minds at the\r\nidea of the elections being held by persons whose time of office had\r\nbeen cut short. Accordingly an interregnum took place. There were two\r\ninterreges, Marcus Valerius and Marcus Fabius. The consuls elected were\r\nTitus Manlius Torquatus a third time, and Publius Decius Mus. It is\r\nagreed on that, in this year, Alexander, king of Epirus, made a descent\r\non Italy with a fleet. Which war, if the first commencement had been\r\nsufficiently successful, would unquestionably have extended to the\r\nRomans. The same was the era of the exploits of Alexander the Great,\r\nwhom, being son to the other's sister, in another region of the world,\r\nhaving shown himself invincible in war, fortune cut short in his youth\r\nby disease. But the Romans, although the revolt of their allies and of\r\nthe Latin nation was now no matter of doubt, yet as if they felt\r\nsolicitude regarding the Samnites, not for themselves, summoned ten of\r\nthe leading men of the Latins to Rome, to whom they wished to issue such\r\norders as they might wish. Latium had at that time two prætors, Lucius\r\nAnnius, a native of Setia, and Lucius Numisius of Circeii, both from the\r\nRoman colonists; through whose means, besides Signia and Velitræ, also\r\nRoman colonies, the Volscians too had been stirred up to arms. It was\r\ndetermined that these two should be summoned specially; it was a matter\r\nof doubt to no one, on what matter they were sent for. Accordingly the\r\nprætors, having held an assembly, before they set out for Rome, inform\r\nthem, that they were summoned by the Roman senate, and consult them as\r\nto what answer it was their wish should be given on those subjects which\r\nthey thought would be discussed with them.\r\n\r\n4. When different persons advanced different opinions, then Annius says:\r\n\"Though I myself put the question, as to what answer it might be your\r\npleasure should be given, yet I think it more concerns our general\r\ninterest how we should act than how we should speak. Your plans being\r\nonce unfolded, it will be easy to suit words to the subject; for if even\r\nnow we are capable of submitting to slavery under the shadow of a\r\nconfederacy on equal terms, what is wanting but to betray the\r\nSidicinians, be obedient to the orders not only of the Romans, but of\r\nthe Samnites, and tell the Romans, that we will lay down our arms\r\nwhenever they intimate it to be their wish? But if at length a desire of\r\nliberty stimulates your minds, if a confederacy does subsist, if\r\nalliance be equalization of rights, if there be reason now to boast that\r\nwe are of the same blood as the Romans, of which they were formerly\r\nashamed, if they have such an army of allies, by the junction of which\r\nthey may double their strength, such a one as their consuls would be\r\nunwilling to separate from themselves either in concluding or commencing\r\ntheir own wars; why are not all things equalized? why is not one of the\r\nconsuls chosen from the Latins? Where there is an equal share of\r\nstrength, is there also an equal share in the government? This indeed in\r\nitself reflects no extraordinary degree of honour on us, as still\r\nacknowledging Rome to be the metropolis of Latium; but that it may\r\npossibly appear to do so, has been effected by our long-continued\r\nforbearance. But if ye ever wished for an opportunity of sharing in the\r\ngovernment, and enjoying freedom, lo! this opportunity is now at hand,\r\npresented both by your own valour and the bounty of the gods. Ye have\r\ntried their patience by refusing them soldiers. Who doubts that they\r\nwere fired with rage, when we broke through a custom of more than two\r\nhundred years? Still they submitted to this feeling of resentment. We\r\nwaged war with the Pelignians in our own name. They who formerly did not\r\neven concede to us the right of defending our own territories through\r\nourselves, interfered not. They heard that the Sidicinians were\r\nreceived under our protection, that the Campanians had revolted from\r\nthemselves to us, that we were preparing armies against their\r\nconfederates, the Samnites; yet they stirred not from the city. Whence\r\nthis so great forbearance on their part, except from a knowledge of our\r\nstrength and their own? I have it from competent authority, that when\r\nthe Samnites complained of us, such an answer was given them by the\r\nRoman senate, as plainly showed that not even themselves insisted that\r\nLatium was under the Roman jurisdiction. Only assume your rights in\r\ndemanding that which they tacitly concede to you. If fear prevents any\r\none from saying this, lo! I pledge myself that I will say it, in the\r\nhearing not only of the Roman people and senate, but of Jupiter himself,\r\nwho inhabits the Capitol; that if they wish us to be in confederacy and\r\nalliance with them, they are to receive one consul from us, and one half\r\nof the senate.\" When he not only recommended these measures boldly, but\r\npromised also his aid, they all, with acclamations of assent, permitted\r\nhim to do and say whatever might appear to him conducive to the republic\r\nof the Latin nation and his own honour.\r\n\r\n5. When they arrived in Rome, an audience of the senate was granted them\r\nin the Capitol. There, when Titus Manlius the consul, by direction of\r\nthe senate, required of them not to make war on their confederates the\r\nSamnites, Annius, as if he had taken the Capitol by arms as a victor,\r\nand were not addressing them as an ambassador protected by the law of\r\nnations, says: \"It were time, Titus Manlius, and you, conscript fathers,\r\nto cease at length treating with us on a footing of superiority, when\r\nyou see Latium in a most flourishing state by the bounty of the gods in\r\narms and men, the Samnites being vanquished in war, the Sidicinians and\r\nCampanians our allies, the Volscians now united to us in alliance, and\r\nthat your own colonies even prefer the government of Latium to that of\r\nRome. But since ye do not bring your minds to put an end to your\r\narbitrary despotism, we, though able by force of arms to vindicate the\r\nindependence of Latium, yet will make this concession to the ties of\r\nblood between us, as to offer terms of peace on terms of equality for\r\nboth, since it has pleased the immortal gods that the strength of both\r\nis equalized. One of the consuls must be selected out of Rome, the\r\nother out of Latium; an equal portion of the senate must be from both\r\nnations; we must be one people, one republic; and that the seat of\r\ngovernment may be the same, and we all may have the same name, since the\r\nconcession must be made by the one party or other, let this, and may it\r\nbe auspicious to both, have the advantage of being the mother country,\r\nand let us all be called Romans.\" It so happened that the Romans also\r\nhad a consul, a match for this man's high spirit; who, so far from\r\nrestraining his angry feelings, openly declared, that if such\r\ninfatuation took possession of the conscript fathers, that they would\r\nreceive laws from a man of Setia, he would himself come into the senate\r\narmed with a sword, and would slay with his hand any Latin whom he\r\nshould see in the senate-house. And turning to the statue of Jupiter,\r\n\"Hear thou, Jupiter,\" says he, \"hear these impious proposals; hear ye\r\nthem, Justice and Equity. Jupiter, art thou to behold foreign consuls\r\nand a foreign senate in thy consecrated temple, as if thou wert a\r\ncaptive and overpowered? Were these the treaties which Tullus, a Roman\r\nking, concluded with the Albans, your forefathers, Latins, and which\r\nLucius Tarquinius subsequently concluded with you? Does not the battle\r\nat the Lake Regillus occur to your thoughts? Have you so forgotten your\r\nown calamities and our kindnesses towards you?\"\r\n\r\n6. When the indignation of the senate followed these words of the\r\nconsul, it is recorded that, in reply to the frequent appeals to the\r\ngods, whom the consuls frequently invoked as witnesses to the treaties,\r\nan expression of Annius was heard in contempt of the divinity of the\r\nRoman Jupiter. Certainly, when aroused with wrath he was proceeding with\r\nrapid steps from the porch of the temple, having fallen down the stairs,\r\nhis head being severely struck, he was dashed against a stone at the\r\nbottom with such force, as to be deprived of sense. As all writers do\r\nnot say that he was killed, I too shall leave it in doubt; as also the\r\ncircumstance, that a storm, with a dreadful noise in the heavens, took\r\nplace during the appeal made in reference to the violated treaties; for\r\nthey may both be true, and also invented aptly to express in a striking\r\nmanner the resentment of heaven. Torquatus, being despatched by the\r\nsenate to dismiss the ambassadors, on seeing Annius lying prostrate,\r\nexclaimed, so as that his voice was heard both by the people and the\r\nsenate, \"It is well. The gods have excited a just war. There is a deity\r\nin heaven. Thou dost exist, great Jove; not without reason have we\r\nconsecrated thee the father of gods and men in this mansion. Why do ye\r\nhesitate, Romans, and you, conscript fathers, to take up arms under the\r\ndirection of the gods? Thus will I lay low the legions of the Latins, as\r\nyou now see this man lying prostrate.\" The words of the consul, received\r\nwith the approbation of the people, filled their breasts with such\r\nardour, that the ambassadors on their departure were protected from the\r\nanger and violence of the people more by the care of the magistrates,\r\nwho escorted them by order of the consul, than by the law of nations.\r\nThe senate also voted for the war; and the consuls, after raising two\r\narmies, marched into the territories of the Marsians and Pelignians, the\r\narmy of the Samnites having joined them, and pitched their camp near\r\nCapua, where the Latins and their allies had now assembled. There it is\r\nsaid there appeared to both the consuls, during sleep, the same form of\r\na man larger and more majestic than human, who said, \"Of the one side a\r\ngeneral, of the other an army was due to the dii Manes and to Mother\r\nEarth; from whichever army a general should devote the legions of the\r\nenemy and himself, in addition, that the victory would belong to that\r\nnation and that party.\" When the consuls compared together these visions\r\nof the night, it was resolved that victims should be slain for the\r\npurpose of averting the anger of the gods; at the same time, that if the\r\nsame portents were exhibited in the entrails as those which had been\r\nseen during sleep, either of the consuls should fulfil the fates. When\r\nthe answers of the haruspices coincided with the secret religious\r\nimpression already implanted in their minds; then, having brought\r\ntogether the lieutenant-generals and tribunes, and having openly\r\nexpounded to them the commands of the gods, they settle among\r\nthemselves, lest the consul's voluntary death should intimidate the army\r\nin the field, that on which side soever the Roman army should commence\r\nto give way, the consul in that quarter should devote himself for the\r\nRoman people and the Quirites. In this consultation it was also\r\nsuggested, that if ever on any occasion any war had been conducted with\r\nstrict discipline, then indeed military discipline should be reduced to\r\nthe ancient standard. What excited their attention particularly was,\r\nthat they had to contend against Latins, who coincided with themselves\r\nin language, manners, in the same kind of arms, and more especially in\r\nmilitary institutions; soldiers had been mixed with soldiers, centurions\r\nwith centurions, tribunes with tribunes, as comrades and colleagues, in\r\nthe same armies, and often in the same companies. Lest in consequence of\r\nthis the soldiers should be involved in any mistake, the consuls issue\r\norders that no one should fight against an enemy out of his post.\r\n\r\n7. It happened that among the other prefects of the troops, who had been\r\nsent out in all directions to reconnoitre, Titus Manlius, the consul's\r\nson, came with his troop to the back of the enemy's camp, so near that\r\nhe was scarcely distant a dart's throw from the next post. In that place\r\nwere some Tusculan cavalry; they were commanded by Geminus Metius, a man\r\ndistinguished among his countrymen both by birth and exploits. When he\r\nrecognised the Roman cavalry, and conspicuous among them the consul's\r\nson marching at their head, (for they were all known to each other,\r\nespecially the men of note,) \"Romans, are ye going to wage war with the\r\nLatins and allies with a single troop. What in the interim will the\r\nconsuls, what will the two consular armies be doing?\" \"They will be here\r\nin good time,\" says Manlius, \"and with them will be Jupiter himself, as\r\na witness of the treaties violated by you, who is stronger and more\r\npowerful. If we fought at the lake Regillus until you had quite enough,\r\nhere also we shall so act, that a line of battle and an encounter with\r\nus may afford you no very great gratification.\" In reply to this,\r\nGeminus, advancing some distance from his own party, says, \"Do you\r\nchoose then, until that day arrives on which you are to put your armies\r\nin motion with such mighty labour, to enter the lists with me, that from\r\nthe result of a contest between us both, it may be seen how much a Latin\r\nexcels a Roman horseman?\" Either resentment, or shame at declining the\r\ncontest, or the invincible power of fate, arouses the determined spirit\r\nof the youth. Forgetful therefore of his father's command, and the\r\nconsul's edict, he is driven headlong to that contest, in which it made\r\nnot much difference whether he conquered or was conquered. The other\r\nhorsemen being removed to a distance as if to witness the sight, in the\r\nspace of clear ground which lay between them they spurred on their\r\nhorses against each other; and when they were together in fierce\r\nencounter, the spear of Manlius passed over the helmet of his\r\nantagonist, that of Metius across the neck of the other's horse. Then\r\nwheeling round their horses, when Manlius arose to repeat the blow, he\r\nfixed his javelin between the ears of his opponent's horse. When, by the\r\npain of this wound, the horse, having raised his fore-feet on high,\r\ntossed his head with great violence, he shook off his rider, whom, when\r\nhe was raising himself from the severe fall, by leaning on his spear and\r\nbuckler, Manlius pierced through the throat, so that the steel passed\r\nout through the ribs, and pinned him to the earth; and having collected\r\nthe spoils, he returned to his own party, and with his troop, who were\r\nexulting with joy, he proceeds to the camp, and thence to the general's\r\ntent to his father, ignorant of what awaited him, whether praise or\r\npunishment had been merited. \"Father,\" says he, \"that all may truly\r\nrepresent me as sprung from your blood; when challenged, I slew my\r\nadversary, and have taken from him these equestrian spoils.\" When the\r\nconsul heard this, immediately turning away from his son, he ordered an\r\nassembly to be summoned by sound of trumpet. When these assembled in\r\ngreat numbers, \"Since you, Titus Manlius,\" says he, \"revering neither\r\nthe consular power nor a father's majesty, have fought against the enemy\r\nout of your post contrary to our orders, and, as far as in you lay, have\r\nsubverted military discipline, by which the Roman power has stood to\r\nthis day, and have brought me to this necessity, that I must either\r\nforget the republic, or myself and mine; we shall expiate our own\r\ntransgressions rather than the republic should sustain so serious a loss\r\nfor our misdeeds. We shall be a melancholy example, but a profitable\r\none, to the youth of future ages. As for me, both the natural affection\r\nfor my children, as well as that instance of bravery which has led you\r\nastray by the false notion of honour, affects me for you. But since\r\neither the authority of consuls is to be established by your death, or\r\nby your forgiveness to be for ever annulled; I do not think that even\r\nyou, if you have any of our blood in you, will refuse to restore, by\r\nyour punishment, the military discipline which has been subverted by\r\nyour misconduct. Go, lictor, bind him to the stake.\" All became\r\nmotionless, more through fear than discipline, astounded by so cruel an\r\norder, each looking on the axe as if drawn against himself. Therefore\r\nwhen they stood in profound silence, suddenly, when the blood spouted\r\nfrom his severed neck, their minds recovering, as it were, from a state\r\nof stupefaction, then their voices arose together in free expressions of\r\ncomplaint, so that they spared neither lamentations nor execrations: and\r\nthe body of the youth, being covered with the spoils, was burned on a\r\npile erected outside the rampart, with all the military zeal with which\r\nany funeral could be celebrated: and Manlian orders were considered with\r\nhorror, not only for the present, but of the most austere severity for\r\nfuture times.\r\n\r\n8. The severity of the punishment however rendered the soldiers more\r\nobedient to the general; and besides that the guards and watches and the\r\nregulation of the posts were every where more strictly attended to, such\r\nseverity was also profitable in the final struggle when they came into\r\nthe field of battle. But the battle was very like to a civil war; so\r\nvery similar was every thing among the Romans and Latins, except with\r\nrespect to courage. The Romans formerly used targets; afterwards, when\r\nthey began to receive pay, they made shields instead of targets; and\r\nwhat before constituted phalanxes similar to the Macedonian, afterwards\r\nbecame a line drawn up in distinct companies. At length they were\r\ndivided into several centuries. A century contained sixty soldiers, two\r\ncenturions, and one standard-bearer. The spearmen (hastati) formed the\r\nfirst line in fifteen companies, with small intervals between them: a\r\ncompany had twenty light-armed soldiers, the rest wearing shields; those\r\nwere called light who carried only a spear and short iron javelins.\r\nThis, which constituted the van in the field of battle, contained the\r\nyouth in early bloom advancing towards the age of service. Next followed\r\nmen of more robust age, in the same number of companies, who were called\r\nprincipes, all wearing shields, and distinguished by the completest\r\narmour. This band of thirty companies they called antepilani, because\r\nthere were fifteen others placed behind them with the standards; of\r\nwhich each company consisted of three divisions, and the first division\r\nof each they called a pilus. Each company consisted of three ensigns,\r\nand contained one hundred and eighty-six men. The first ensign was at\r\nthe head of the Triarii, veteran soldiers of tried bravery; the second,\r\nat the head of the Rorarii, men whose ability was less by reason of\r\ntheir age and course of service; the third, at the head of the Accensi,\r\na body in whom very little confidence was reposed. For this reason also\r\nthey were thrown back to the rear. When the army was marshalled\r\naccording to this arrangement, the spearmen first commenced the fight.\r\nIf the spearmen were unable to repulse the enemy, they retreated\r\nleisurely, and were received by the principes into the intervals of the\r\nranks. The fight then devolved on the principes; the spearmen followed.\r\nThe Triarii continued kneeling behind the ensigns, their left leg\r\nextended forward, holding their shields resting on their shoulders, and\r\ntheir spears fixed in the ground, with the points erect, so that their\r\nline bristled as if enclosed by a rampart. If the principes also did not\r\nmake sufficient impression in the fight, they retreated slowly from the\r\nfront to the Triarii. Hence, when a difficulty is felt, \"Matters have\r\ncome to the Triarii,\" became a usual proverb. The Triarii rising up,\r\nafter receiving the principes and spearmen into the intervals between\r\ntheir ranks, immediately closing their files, shut up as it were the\r\nopenings; and in one compact body fell upon the enemy, no other hope\r\nbeing now left: that was the most formidable circumstance to the enemy,\r\nwhen having pursued them as vanquished, they beheld a new line suddenly\r\nstarting up, increased also in strength. In general about four legions\r\nwere raised, each consisting of five thousand infantry and three hundred\r\nhorse. As many more were added from the Latin levy, who were at that\r\ntime enemies to the Romans, and drew up their line after the same\r\nmanner; and they knew that unless the ranks were disturbed they would\r\nhave to engage not only standard with standard, spearmen with spearmen,\r\nprincipes with principes, but centurion also with centurion. There were\r\namong the veterans two first centurions in either army, the Roman by no\r\nmeans possessing bodily strength, but a brave man, and experienced in\r\nthe service; the Latin powerful in bodily strength, and a first-rate\r\nwarrior; they were very well known to each other, because they had\r\nalways held equal rank. The Roman, somewhat diffident of his strength,\r\nhad at Rome obtained permission from the consuls, to select any one whom\r\nhe wished, his own subcenturion, to protect him from the one destined to\r\nbe his adversary; and this youth being opposed to him in the battle,\r\nobtained the victory over the Latin centurion. They came to an\r\nengagement not far from the foot of Mount Vesuvius, where the road led\r\nto the Veseris.\r\n\r\n9. The Roman consuls, before they marched out their armies to the field,\r\noffered sacrifices. The aruspex is said to have shown to Decius the head\r\nof the liver wounded on the side relating to himself, in other respects\r\nthe victim was acceptable to the gods; whilst Manlius obtained highly\r\nfavourable omens from his sacrifice. \"But all is well,\" says Decius, \"if\r\nmy colleague has offered an acceptable sacrifice.\" The ranks being drawn\r\nup in the order already described, they marched forth to battle. Manlius\r\ncommanded the right, Decius the left wing. At first the action was\r\nconducted with equal strength on both sides, and with the same ardent\r\ncourage. Afterwards the Roman spearmen on the left wing, not sustaining\r\nthe violent assault of the Latins, betook themselves to the principes.\r\nIn this state of trepidation the consul Decius cries out with a loud\r\nvoice to Marcus Valerius, \"Valerius, we have need of the aid of the\r\ngods. Come, as public pontiff of the Roman people, dictate to me the\r\nwords in which I may devote myself for the legions.\" The pontiff\r\ndirected him to take the gown called prætexta, and with his head covered\r\nand his hand thrust out under the gown to the chin, standing upon a\r\nspear placed under his feet, to say these words: \"Janus, Jupiter, father\r\nMars, Quirinus, Bellona, ye Lares, ye gods Novensiles,[171] ye gods\r\nIndigetes, ye divinities, under whose power we and our enemies are, and\r\nye dii Manes, I pray you, I adore you, I ask your favour, that you would\r\nprosperously grant strength and victory to the Roman people, the\r\nQuirites; and that ye may affect the enemies of the Roman people, the\r\nQuirites, with terror, dismay, and death. In such manner as I have\r\nexpressed in words, so do I devote the legions and auxiliaries of the\r\nenemy, together with myself, to the dii Manes and to Earth for the\r\nrepublic of the Quirites, for the army, legions, auxiliaries of the\r\nRoman people, the Quirites.\" Having uttered this prayer, he orders the\r\nlictors to go to Titus Manlius, and without delay to announce to his\r\ncolleague that he had devoted himself for the army. He, girding himself\r\nin a Gabine cincture, and fully armed, mounted his horse, and rushed\r\ninto the midst of the enemy. He was observed by both armies to present a\r\nmore majestic appearance than human, as one sent from heaven as an\r\nexpiation of all the wrath of the gods, to transfer to the enemy\r\ndestruction turned away from his own side: accordingly, all the terror\r\nand panic being carried along with him, at first disturbed the\r\nbattalions of the Latins, then completely pervaded their entire line.\r\nThis was most evident, because, in whatever direction he was carried\r\nwith his horse, there they became panic-stricken, as if struck by some\r\npestilential constellation; but when he fell overwhelmed with darts,\r\ninstantly the cohorts of the Latins, thrown into manifest consternation,\r\ntook to flight, leaving a void to a considerable extent. At the same\r\ntime also the Romans, their minds being freed from religious dread,\r\nexerting themselves as if the signal was then given for the first time,\r\ncommenced to fight with renewed ardour. For the Rorarii also pushed\r\nforward among the antepilani, and added strength to the spearmen and\r\nprincipes, and the Triarii resting on the right knee awaited the\r\nconsul's nod to rise up.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 171: The Novensiles were nine deities brought to Rome by the\r\nSabines: Lara, Vesta, Minerva, Feronia, Concord, Faith, Fortune, Chance,\r\nHealth. See Niebuhr III. ii. 249.]\r\n\r\n10. Afterwards, as the contest proceeded, when the superior numbers of\r\nthe Latins had the advantage in some places, the consul, Manlius, on\r\nhearing the circumstance of his colleague's death, after he had, as was\r\nright and just, honoured his so glorious a death with tears, as well as\r\nwith praises so well merited, hesitated, for a little time, whether it\r\nwas yet time for the Triarii to rise; then judging it better that they\r\nshould be kept fresh for the decisive blow, he ordered the Accensi to\r\nadvance from the rear before the standards. When they moved forward, the\r\nLatins immediately called up their Triarii, as if their opponents had\r\ndone the same thing: who, when they had by desperate fighting for a\r\nconsiderable time both fatigued themselves, and had either broken or\r\nblunted their spears, and were, however, beating back their adversaries,\r\nthinking that the battle was now nearly decided, and that they had come\r\nto the last line; then the consul calls to the Triarii, \"Arise now,\r\nfresh as ye are, against men now wearied, mindful of your country and\r\nparents, your wives and children; mindful of your consul who has\r\nsubmitted to death to insure your victory.\" When the Triarii arose,\r\nfresh as they were, with their arms glittering, a new line which\r\nappeared unexpectedly, receiving the antepilani into the intervals\r\nbetween the ranks, raised a shout, and broke through the first line of\r\nthe Latins; and goading their faces, after cutting down those who\r\nconstituted their principal strength, they passed almost intact through\r\nthe other companies, with such slaughter that they scarcely left one\r\nfourth of the enemy. The Samnites also, drawn up at a distance at the\r\nfoot of the mountain, struck terror into the Latins. But of all, whether\r\ncitizens or allies, the principal praise for that action was due to the\r\nconsuls; the one of whom turned on himself alone all the threats and\r\ndangers (denounced) by the divinities of heaven and hell; the other\r\nevinced such valour and such judgment in the battle, that it was\r\nuniversally agreed among both the Romans and Latins who have transmitted\r\nto posterity an account of the battle, that, on whichever side Titus\r\nManlius held the command, the victory must belong to that. The Latins in\r\ntheir flight betook themselves to Minturnæ. Immediately after the battle\r\nthe camp was taken, and great numbers still alive were surprised\r\ntherein, chiefly Campanians. Night surprised them in their search, and\r\nprevented the body of Decius from being discovered on that day. On the\r\nday after it was found amid vast heaps of slaughtered enemies, pierced\r\nwith a great number of darts, and his funeral was solemnized under the\r\ndirection of his colleague, in a manner suited to his death. It seems\r\nright to add here, that it is lawful for a consul, a dictator, and a\r\nprætor, when he devotes the legions of the enemy, to devote not himself\r\nparticularly, but whatever citizen he may choose out of a Roman legion\r\nregularly enrolled: if the person who has been devoted die, the matter\r\nis duly performed; if he do not perish, then an image, seven feet high\r\nor more, must be buried in the ground, and a victim slain, as an\r\nexpiation. Where that image shall be buried, there it is not lawful that\r\na Roman magistrate should pass. But if he wish to devote himself, as\r\nDecius did, unless he who has devoted himself die, he shall not with\r\npropriety perform any act of religion regarding either himself or the\r\npublic. Should he wish to devote his arms to Vulcan or to any other god,\r\nhe has a right, whether he shall please, by a victim, or in any other\r\nmanner. It is not proper that the enemy should get possession of the\r\nweapon, on which the consul, standing, pronounced the imprecation: if\r\nthey should get possession of it, then an expiation must be made to Mars\r\nby the sacrifices called the Suove-taurilia. Although the memory of\r\nevery divine and human custom has been obliterated, in consequence of\r\npreferring what is modern and foreign to that which is ancient and\r\nbelonging to our own country, I deemed it not irrelevant to relate the\r\nparticulars even in the very terms used, as they have been handed down\r\nand expressed.\r\n\r\n11. I find it stated in some writers, that the Samnites, having awaited\r\nthe issue of the battle, came at length with support to the Romans after\r\nthe battle was over. Also aid from Lavinium, whilst they wasted time in\r\ndeliberating, was at length sent to the Latins after they had been\r\nvanquished. And when the first standards and part of the army just\r\nissued from the gates, news being brought of the defeat of the Latins,\r\nthey faced about and returned back to the city; on which occasion they\r\nsay that their prætor, Milionius, observed, that \"for so very short a\r\njourney a high price must be paid to the Romans.\" Such of the Latins as\r\nsurvived the battle, after being scattered over many roads, collected\r\nthemselves into a body, and found refuge in the city of Vescia. There\r\ntheir general, Numisius, insisted in their counsels, that \"the truly\r\ncommon fortune of war had prostrated both armies by equal losses, and\r\nthat only the name of victory rested with the Romans; that in other\r\nrespects they too shared the lot of defeated persons; the two pavilions\r\nof the consuls were polluted; one by the murder committed on a son, the\r\nother by the blood of a devoted consul; that their army was cut down in\r\nevery direction; their spearmen and principes were cut down; great havoc\r\nwas made before the standards and behind them; the Triarii at length\r\nrestored their cause. Though the forces of the Latins were cut down in\r\nan equal proportion, yet for reinforcements, Latium or the Volscians\r\nwere nearer than Rome. Wherefore, if they thought well of it, he would\r\nspeedily call out the youth from the Latin and Volscian states, and\r\nwould return to Capua with a determined army, and by his unexpected\r\narrival strike dismay among the Romans, who were expecting nothing less\r\nthan battle.\" Deceptive letters being sent around Latium and the\r\nVolscian nation, a tumultuary army, hastily raised from all quarters,\r\nwas assembled, for as they had not been present at the battle, they were\r\nmore disposed to believe on slight grounds. This army the consul\r\nTorquatus met at Trisanum, a place between Sinuessa and Minturnæ. Before\r\na place was selected for a camp, the baggage on both sides being piled\r\nup in a heap, they fought and terminated the war; for so impaired was\r\ntheir strength, that all the Latins surrendered themselves to the\r\nconsul, who was leading his victorious army to lay waste their lands,\r\nand the Campanians followed the example of this surrender. Latium and\r\nCapua were fined some land. The Latin with the addition of the\r\nPrivernian land; and the Falernian land, which had belonged to the\r\npeople of Campania, as far as the river Vulturnus, is all distributed to\r\nthe commons of Rome. In the Latin land two acres a man were assigned, so\r\nthat they should receive an additional three-fourths of an acre from the\r\nPrivernian land; in the Falernian land three acres were assigned, one\r\nfourth of an acre being further added, in consideration of the distance.\r\nOf the Latins the Laurentians were exempted from punishment, as also the\r\nhorsemen of the Campanians, because they had not revolted. An order was\r\nissued that the treaty should be renewed with the Laurentians; and it is\r\nrenewed every year since, on the tenth day after the Latin festival. The\r\nrights of citizenship were granted to the Campanian horsemen; and that\r\nit might serve as a memorial, they hung up a brazen tablet in the temple\r\nof Castor at Rome. The Campanian state was also enjoined to pay them a\r\nyearly stipend of four hundred and fifty denarii each; their number\r\namounted to one thousand six hundred.\r\n\r\n12. The war being thus concluded, after rewards and punishment were\r\ndistributed according to the deserts of each, Titus Manlius returned to\r\nRome: on his approach it appears that the aged only went forth to meet\r\nhim; and that the young men, both then, and all his life after, detested\r\nand cursed him. The Antians made incursions on the territories of Ostia,\r\nArdea, and Solonia. The consul Manlius, because he was unable by reason\r\nof his health to conduct that war, nominated as dictator Lucius Papirius\r\nCrassus, who then happened to be prætor; by him Lucius Papirius Cursor\r\nwas appointed master of the horse. Nothing worthy of mention was\r\nperformed against the Antians by the dictator, although he had kept a\r\nstanding camp for several months in the Antian territory. To a year\r\nsignalized by a victory over so many and such powerful states, further\r\nby the illustrious death of one of the consuls, as well as by the\r\nunrelenting, though memorable, severity of command in the other, there\r\nsucceeded as consuls Titus Æmilius Mamercinus and Quintus Publilius\r\nPhilo; neither to a similar opportunity of exploits, and they themselves\r\nbeing mindful rather of their own interests as well as of those of the\r\nparties in the state, than of the interests of their country. They\r\nrouted on the plains of Ferentinum, and stripped of their camp, the\r\nLatins, who, in resentment of the land they had lost, took up arms\r\nagain. Publilius, under whose guidance and auspices the action had been\r\nfought, receiving the submission of the Latin states, who had lost a\r\ngreat many of their young men there, Æmilius marched the army to Pedum.\r\nThe people of Pedum were supported by the states of Tibur, Præneste, and\r\nVelitræ; auxiliaries had also come from Lanuvium and Antium. Where,\r\nthough the Romans had the advantage in several engagements, still the\r\nentire labour remained at the city of Pedum itself and at the camp of\r\nthe allied states, which was adjoining the city: suddenly leaving the\r\nwar unfinished, because he heard that a triumph was decreed to his\r\ncolleague, he himself also returned to Rome to demand a triumph before a\r\nvictory had been obtained. The senate displeased by this ambitious\r\nconduct, and refusing a triumph unless Pedum was either taken or should\r\nsurrender, Æmilius, alienated from the senate in consequence of this\r\nact, administered the remainder of the consulship like to a seditious\r\ntribuneship. For, as long as he was consul, he neither ceased to\r\ncriminate the patricians to the people, his colleague by no means\r\ninterfering, because he himself also was a plebeian; (the scanty\r\ndistribution of the land among the commons in the Latin and Falernian\r\nterritory afforded the groundwork of the criminations;) and when the\r\nsenate, wishing to put an end to the administration of the consuls,\r\nordered a dictator to be nominated against the Latins, who were again in\r\narms, Æmilius, to whom the fasces then belonged, nominated his colleague\r\ndictator; by him Junius Brutus was constituted master of the horse. The\r\ndictatorship was popular, both in consequence of his discourses\r\ncontaining invectives against the patricians, and because he passed\r\nthree laws, most advantageous to the commons, and injurious to the\r\nnobility; one, that the orders of the commons should be binding on all\r\nthe Romans; another, that the patricians should, before the suffrages\r\ncommenced, declare their approbation of the laws which should be passed\r\nin the assemblies of the centuries; the third, that one at least of the\r\ncensors should be elected from the commons, as they had already gone so\r\nfar as that it was lawful that both the consuls should be plebeians. The\r\npatricians considered that more of detriment had been sustained on that\r\nyear from the consuls and dictator than was counterbalanced by their\r\nsuccess and achievements abroad.\r\n\r\n13. On the following year, Lucius Furius Camillus and Caius Mænius were\r\nconsuls, in order that the neglect of his duty by Æmilius, the consul of\r\nthe preceding year, might be rendered more markedly reproachful, the\r\nsenate loudly urge that Pedum should be assailed with arms, men, and\r\nevery kind of force, and be demolished; and the new consuls, being\r\nforced to give that matter the precedence of all others, set out on that\r\nexpedition. The state of affairs was now such in Latium, that they could\r\nno longer submit to either war or peace. For war they were deficient in\r\nresources; they spurned at peace through resentment for the loss of\r\ntheir land. It seemed necessary therefore to steer a middle course, to\r\nkeep within their towns, so that the Romans by being provoked might have\r\nno pretext for hostilities; and that if the siege of any town should be\r\nannounced to them, aid should be sent from every quarter from all the\r\nstates. And still the people of Pedum were aided by only a very few\r\nstates. The Tiburtians and Prænestines, whose territory lay nearest,\r\ncame to Pedum. Mænius suddenly making an attack, defeated the\r\nAricinians, and Lanuvians, and Veliternians, at the river Astura, the\r\nVolscians of Antium forming a junction with them. The Tiburtian, far the\r\nstrongest body, Camillus engages at Pedum, encountering much greater\r\ndifficulty, though with a result equally successful. A sudden sally of\r\nthe townsmen during the battle chiefly occasioned confusion: Camillus,\r\nturning on these with a part of his army, not only drove them within\r\ntheir walls, but on the very same day, after he had discomfited\r\nthemselves and their auxiliaries, he took the town by scalade. It was\r\nthen resolved to lead round with greater energy and spirit his\r\nvictorious army from the storming of a single city to the entire\r\nconquest of Latium. Nor did they stop until they reduced all Latium,\r\neither by storming, or by becoming masters of the cities one after the\r\nother by capitulation. Then, disposing garrisons in the towns which they\r\nhad taken, they departed to Rome to a triumph universally admitted to\r\nbe due to them. To the triumph was added the honour of having equestrian\r\nstatues erected to them in the forum, a compliment very unusual at that\r\nperiod. Before they commenced holding the meeting for the election of\r\nthe consuls for the ensuing year, Camillus moved the senate concerning\r\nthe Latin states, and spoke thus: \"Conscript fathers, that which was to\r\nbe done by war and arms in Latium has now been fully accomplished by the\r\nbounty of the gods and the valour of the soldiers. The armies of the\r\nenemy have been cut down at Pedum and the Astura. All the Latin towns,\r\nand Antium belonging to the Volscians, either taken by storm, or\r\nreceived into surrender, are occupied by your garrisons. It now remains\r\nto be considered, since they annoy us by their repeated rebellions, how\r\nwe may keep them in quiet submission and in the observance of perpetual\r\npeace. The immortal gods have put the determination of this matter so\r\ncompletely in your power, that they have placed it at your option\r\nwhether Latium is to exist henceforward or not. Ye can therefore insure\r\nto yourselves perpetual peace, as far as regards the Latins, either by\r\nadopting severe or lenient measures. Do ye choose to adopt cruel conduct\r\ntowards people who have surrendered and have been conquered? Ye may\r\ndestroy all Latium, make a vast desert of a place whence, in many and\r\nserious wars, ye have often made use of an excellent army of allies. Do\r\nyou wish, according to the example of your ancestors, to augment the\r\nRoman state by admitting the vanquished among your citizens? Materials\r\nfor extending your power by the highest glory are at hand. That\r\ngovernment is certainly by far the most secure, which the subjects feel\r\na pleasure in obeying. But whatever determination ye wish to come to, it\r\nis necessary that it be speedy. So many states have ye in a state of\r\nsuspense between hope and fear; and it is necessary that you be\r\ndischarged as soon as possible of your solicitude about them, and that\r\ntheir minds, whilst they are still in a state of insensibility from\r\nuncertainty, be at once impressed either by punishment or clemency. It\r\nwas our duty to bring matters to such a pass that you may have full\r\npower to deliberate on every matter; yours to decide what is most\r\nexpedient to yourselves and the commonwealth.\"\r\n\r\n14. The principal members of the senate applauded the consul's\r\nstatement of the business on the whole; but said that \"as the states\r\nwere differently circumstanced, that their plan might be readily\r\nadjusted so that it might be determined according to the desert of each,\r\nif they should put the question regarding each state specifically.\" The\r\nquestion was therefore so put regarding each separately and a decree\r\npast. To the Lanuvians the right of citizenship was granted, and the\r\nexercise of their religious rights was restored to them with this\r\nprovision, that the temple and grove of Juno Sospita should be common\r\nbetween the Lanuvian burghers and the Roman people. The Aricians,\r\nNomentans, and Pedans were admitted into the number of citizens on the\r\nsame terms as the Lanuvians. To the Tusculans the rights of citizenship\r\nwhich they already possessed were continued; and the crime of rebellion\r\nwas turned from disaffection on public grounds against a few\r\ninstigators. On the Veliternians, Roman citizens of long standing,\r\nmeasures of great severity were inflicted because they had so often\r\nrebelled; their walls were razed, and their senate removed from thence,\r\nand they were ordered to dwell on the other side of the Tiber, so that\r\nthe fine of any individual who should be caught on the hither side of\r\nthat river should amount to one thousand _asses_; and that the person\r\nwho had apprehended him, should not discharge his prisoner from\r\nconfinement, until the money was paid down. Into the land of the\r\nsenators colonists were sent; from the additions of which Velitræ\r\nrecovered its appearance of former populousness. A new colony was also\r\nsent to Antium, with this provision, that if the Antians desired to be\r\nenrolled as colonists, permission to that effect should be granted.\r\nTheir ships of war were removed from thence, and the people of Antium\r\nwere interdicted the sea, and the rights of citizenship were granted\r\nthem. The Tiburtians and Prænestines were amerced in some land, not only\r\non account of the recent guilt of the rebellion, which was common to\r\nthem with the other Latins; but also because, from their dislike to the\r\nRoman government, they had formerly associated in arms with the Gauls, a\r\nnation of savages. From the other Latin states they took away the\r\nprivileges of intermarriage, commerce, and of holding meetings. To the\r\nCampanians, in compliment to their horsemen, because they had refused to\r\njoin in rebellion with the Latins, and to the Fundans and Formians,\r\nbecause the passage through their territories had been always secure and\r\npeaceful, the freedom of the state was granted with the right of\r\nsuffrage. It was determined that the people of Cumæ and Suessula should\r\nhave the same rights and be on the same footing as Capua. Of the ships\r\nof the Antians some were drawn up to the docks at Rome, some were\r\nburned, and with the prows of these a pulpit built in the forum was\r\nordered to be decorated; and that temple was called Rostra.\r\n\r\n15. During the consulship of Caius Sulpicius Longus and Publius Ælius\r\nPætus, when the Roman power not more than the kindly feeling engendered\r\nby acts of kindness diffused the blessings of peace among all parties, a\r\nwar broke out between the Sidicinians and Auruncans. The Auruncans\r\nhaving been admitted into alliance on the occasion of their\r\nsurrendering, had since that period made no disturbance; accordingly\r\nthey had a juster pretext for seeking aid from the Romans. But before\r\nthe consuls led forth their army from the city, (for the senate had\r\nordered the Auruncans to be defended,) intelligence is brought that the\r\nAuruncans deserted their town through fear, and flying with their wives\r\nand children, that they fortified Suessa, which is now called Aurunca;\r\nthat their ancient walls and city were demolished by the Sidicinians.\r\nThe senate being in consequence incensed against the consuls, by whose\r\ndelays the allies had been betrayed, ordered a dictator to be created.\r\nCaius Claudius Regillensis was appointed, and he nominated Caius\r\nClaudius Hortator as master of the horse. A scruple afterwards arose\r\nconcerning the dictator; and when the augurs declared that he seemed to\r\nhave been created under an informality, the dictator and the master of\r\nthe horse laid down their office. This year Minucia, a vestal, at first\r\nsuspected on account of her dress being more elegant than was becoming,\r\nafterwards being arraigned before the pontiffs on the testimony of a\r\nslave, after she had been ordered by their decree to abstain from\r\nmeddling in sacred rites, and to keep her slaves under her own power,\r\nwhen brought to trial, was buried alive at the Colline gate, on the\r\nright of the causeway, in the field of wickedness. I suppose that name\r\nwas given to the place from her crime. On the same year Quintus\r\nPublilius Philo was the first of the plebeians elected prætor, being\r\nopposed by Sulpicius the consul, who refused to take any notice of him\r\nas a candidate; the senate, as they had not succeeded on that ground in\r\nthe case of the highest offices, being less earnest with respect to the\r\nprætorship.\r\n\r\n16. The following year, Lucius Papirius Crassus and Kæso Duilius being\r\nconsuls, was distinguished by a war with the Ausonians, as being new\r\nrather than important. This people inhabited the city Cales; they had\r\nunited their arms with their neighbours the Sidicinians; and the army of\r\nthe two states being defeated in one battle scarcely worthy of record,\r\nwas induced to take to flight the earlier in consequence of the\r\nproximity of the cities, and the more sheltered on their flight. Nor did\r\nthe senate, however, discontinue their attention to that war, because\r\nthe Sidicinians had now so often taken up arms either as principals, or\r\nhad afforded aid to those who did so, or had been the cause of\r\nhostilities. Accordingly they exerted themselves with all their might,\r\nto raise to the consulship for the fourth time, Marcus Valerius Corvus,\r\nthe greatest general of that day. To Corvus was added Marcus Atilius\r\nRegulus as colleague; and lest any disappointment might by any chance\r\noccur, a request was made of the consuls, that, without drawing lots,\r\nthat province might be assigned to Corvus. Receiving the victorious army\r\nfrom the former consuls, proceeding to Cales, whence the war had\r\noriginated, after he had, at the first shout and onset, routed the\r\nenemy, who were disheartened by the recollection also of the former\r\nengagement, he set about attacking the town itself. And such was the\r\nardour of the soldiers, that they wished to advance immediately up to\r\nthe walls, and strenuously asserted that they would scale them. Corvus,\r\nbecause that was a hazardous undertaking, wished to accomplish his\r\nobject rather by the labour than the risk of his men. Accordingly he\r\nformed a rampart, prepared his vineæ, and advanced towers up to the\r\nwalls; but an opportunity which accidentally presented itself, prevented\r\nthe occasion for them. For Marcius Fabius, a Roman prisoner, when,\r\nhaving broken his chains during the inattention of his guards on a\r\nfestival day, suspending himself by means of a rope which was fastened\r\nto a battlement of the wall, he let himself down by the hands, persuaded\r\nthe general to make an assault on the enemy whilst stupified by wine and\r\nfeasting; nor were the Ausonians, together with their city, captured\r\nwith greater difficulty than they had been routed in the field. A great\r\namount of booty was obtained; and a garrison being stationed at Cales,\r\nthe legions were marched back to Rome. The consul triumphed in pursuance\r\nof a decree of the senate; and that Atilius might not be without a share\r\nof glory, both the consuls were ordered to lead the army against the\r\nSidicinians. But first, in conformity with a decree of the senate, they\r\nnominated as dictator for the purpose of holding the elections, Lucius\r\nÆmilius Mamercinus; he named Quintus Publilius Philo his master of the\r\nhorse. The dictator presiding at the elections, Titus Veturius and\r\nSpurius Postumius were elected consuls. Though a part of the war with\r\nthe Sidicinians still remained; yet that they might anticipate, by an\r\nact of kindness, the wishes of the commons, they proposed about sending\r\na colony to Cales; and a decree of the senate being passed that two\r\nthousand five hundred men should be enrolled for that purpose, they\r\nappointed Kæso Duilius, Titus Quinctius, and Marcus Fabius commissioners\r\nfor conducting the colony and distributing the land.\r\n\r\n17. The new consuls then, recovering the army from their predecessors,\r\nentered the enemy's territories and carried their depredations up to the\r\nwalls and the city. There because the Sidicinians, who had raised a\r\nnumerous army, seemed determined to fight vigorously for their last\r\nhope, and a report existed that Samnium also was preparing for\r\nhostilities, Publius Cornelius Rufinus was created dictator by the\r\nconsuls in pursuance of a decree of the senate; Marcus Antonius was\r\nnominated master of the horse. A scruple afterwards arose that they were\r\nelected under an informality: and they laid down their office; and\r\nbecause a pestilence followed, recourse was had to an interregnum, as if\r\nall the auspices had been infected by that irregularity. By Marcus\r\nValerius Corvus, the fifth interrex from the commencement of the\r\ninterregnum, Aulus Cornelius a second time, and Cneius Domitius were\r\nelected consuls. Things being now tranquil, the rumour of a Gallic war\r\nhad the effect of a real outbreak, so that they were determined that a\r\ndictator should be nominated. Marcus Papirius Crassus was nominated, and\r\nPublius Valerius Publicola master of the horse. And when the levy was\r\nconducted by them with more activity than was deemed necessary in the\r\ncase of neighbouring wars, scouts were sent out and brought word, that\r\nthere was perfect quiet with the Gauls in every direction. It was\r\nsuspected that Samnium also was now for the second year in a state of\r\ndisturbance in consequence of their entertaining new designs: hence the\r\nRoman troops were not withdrawn from the Sidicinian territory. But a\r\nhostile attack made by Alexander of Epirus on the Lucanians drew away\r\nthe attention of the Samnites to another quarter; these two nations\r\nfought a pitched battle against the king, as he was making a descent on\r\nthe district adjoining Pæstum. Alexander, having come off victorious in\r\nthat contest, concluded a peace with the Romans; with what fidelity he\r\nwould have kept it, if his other projects had been equally successful,\r\nis uncertain. The same year the census was performed, and the new\r\ncitizens were rated; on their account the Mæscian and Scaptian tribes\r\nwere added: the censors who added them were Quintus Publilius Philo and\r\nSpurius Postumius. The Acerrans were enrolled as Romans, in conformity\r\nwith a law introduced by the prætor, Lucius Papirius, by which the right\r\nof citizenship with the privilege of suffrage was conferred. These were\r\nthe transactions at home and abroad during that year.\r\n\r\n18. The following year was disastrous, whether by the intemperature of\r\nthe air, or by human guilt, Marcus Claudius Marcellus and Caius Valerius\r\nbeing consuls. I find in the annals Flaccus and Potitus variously given\r\nas the surname of the consul; but in this it is of little consequence\r\nwhich is the true one. I would heartily wish that this other account\r\nwere a false one, (nor indeed do all writers mention it,) viz. that\r\nthose persons, whose death rendered the year signal for the pestilence,\r\nwere carried off by poison. The circumstance however must be stated as\r\nit is handed down to us, that I may not detract from the credit of any\r\nwriter. When the principal persons of the state were dying of similar\r\ndiseases, and all generally with the same result, a certain maid-servant\r\nundertook, before Quintius Fabius Maximus, curule ædile, to discover the\r\ncause of the public malady, provided the public faith would be given to\r\nher by him, that the discovery should not be made detrimental to her.\r\nFabius immediately lays the matter before the consuls, and the consuls\r\nbefore the senate, and with the concurrence of that order the public\r\nfaith was pledged to the informer. It was then disclosed that the state\r\nwas afflicted by the wickedness of certain women, and that certain\r\nmatrons were preparing those poisonous drugs; and if they wished to\r\nfollow her forthwith, they might be detected in the very fact. Having\r\nfollowed the informer, they found women preparing certain drugs, and\r\nothers of the same kind laid up. These being brought into the forum, and\r\nseveral matrons, to the number of twenty, in whose possession they had\r\nbeen detected, being summoned by the beadle, two of them, Cornelia and\r\nSergia, both of patrician rank, maintaining that these drugs were\r\nwholesome, were directed by the informer who confronted them to drink\r\nsome, that they might convict her of having stated what was false;\r\nhaving taken time to confer together, when, the crowd being removed,\r\nthey referred the matter to the other matrons in the open view of all;\r\nthey also not refusing to drink, they all drank of the preparation, and\r\nperished by their own wicked device. Their attendants being instantly\r\nseized, informed against a great number of matrons, of whom to the\r\nnumber of one hundred and seventy were condemned. Nor up to that day was\r\nthere ever an inquiry made at Rome concerning poisoning. The\r\ncircumstance was considered a prodigy; and seemed the act rather of\r\ninsane persons than of persons depraved by guilt. Wherefore mention\r\nhaving been found in the annals, that formerly in the secessions of the\r\ncommons the nail had been driven by the dictator, and that the minds of\r\nthe people, distracted by discord, had been restored to a sane state, it\r\nwas determined that a dictator should be nominated for the purpose of\r\ndriving the nail. Cneius Quinctilius being nominated, appointed Lucius\r\nValerius master of the horse, who, as soon as the nail was driven,\r\nabdicated their offices.\r\n\r\n19. Lucius Papirius Crassus a second time, and Lucius Plautius Venno\r\nwere elected consuls; at the commencement of which year ambassadors came\r\nto Rome from the Fabraternians, a Volscian people, and from the\r\nLucanians, soliciting to be admitted into alliance: [promising] that if\r\nthey were defended from the arms of the Samnites, they would continue in\r\nfidelity and obedience under the government of the Roman people.\r\nAmbassadors were then sent by the senate; and the Samnites were directed\r\nto withhold all violence from the territories of those states; and this\r\nembassy proved effectual not so much because the Samnites were desirous\r\nof peace, as because they were not prepared for war. The same year a war\r\nbroke out with the people of Privernum; in which the people of Fundi\r\nwere their supporters, their leader also being a Fundanian, Vitruvius\r\nVaccus; a man of distinction not only at home, but in Rome also. He had\r\na house on the Palatine hill, which, after the building was razed and\r\nthe ground thrown open, was called the Vacciprata. Lucius Papirius\r\nhaving set out to oppose him whilst devastating extensively the\r\ndistricts of Setia, Norba, and Cora, posted himself at no great distance\r\nfrom his camp. Vitruvius neither adopted the prudent resolution to\r\nenclose himself with his trenches against an enemy his superior in\r\nstrength, nor had he sufficient courage to engage at any great distance\r\nfrom his camp. When his army had scarcely got out of the gate of the\r\ncamp, and his soldiers were looking backwards to flight rather than to\r\nbattle or the enemy, he enters on an engagement without judgment or\r\nboldness; and as he was conquered by a very slight effort and\r\nunequivocally, so did he by the very shortness of the distance, and by\r\nthe facility of his retreat into the camp so near at hand, protect his\r\nsoldiers without difficulty from much loss; and scarcely were any slain\r\nin the engagement itself, and but few in the confusion of the flight in\r\nthe rear, whilst they were making their way into the camp; and as soon\r\nas it was dark they repaired to Privernum in trepidation, so that they\r\nmight protect themselves rather by walls than by a rampart. Plautius,\r\nthe other consul, after laying waste the lands in every direction and\r\ndriving off the spoil, leads his army into the Fundanian territory. The\r\nsenate of the Fundanians met him as he was entering their borders; they\r\ndeclare that \"they had not come to intercede in behalf of Vitruvius or\r\nthose who followed his faction, but in behalf of the people of Fundi,\r\nwhose exemption from any blame in the war had been proved by Vitruvius\r\nhimself, when he made Privernum his place of retreat, and not his native\r\ncountry, Fundi. At Privernum, therefore, the enemies of the Roman people\r\nwere to be looked for, and punished, who revolted at the same time from\r\nthe Fundanians and the Romans, unmindful of both countries. That the\r\nFundanians were at peace, that they had Roman feelings and a grateful\r\nrecollection of the political rights received. They entreated the consul\r\nto withhold war from an inoffensive people; their lands, city, their own\r\nbodies and those of their wives and children, were, and ever should be,\r\nat the disposal of the Roman people.\" The consul, having commended the\r\nFundanians, and despatched letters to Rome that the Fundanians had\r\npreserved their allegiance, turned his march to Privernum. Claudius\r\nstates, that the consul first punished those who were at the head of the\r\nconspiracy; that three hundred and fifty of the conspirators were sent\r\nin chains to Rome; and that such submission was not received by the\r\nsenate, because they considered that the people of Fundi wished to come\r\noff with impunity by the punishment of needy and humble persons.\r\n\r\n20. While the siege of Privernum was being conducted by the two consular\r\narmies, one of the consuls was recalled to Rome, on account of the\r\nelections. This year gaols were first erected in the circus. While the\r\nattention of the public was still occupied by the Privernian war, an\r\nalarming report of the Gauls being in arms, a matter scarcely ever\r\nslighted by the senate, suddenly came on them. The new consuls,\r\ntherefore, Lucius Æmilius Mamercinus and Caius Plautius, on the calends\r\nof July, the very day on which they entered into office, received orders\r\nto settle the provinces immediately between themselves; and Mamercinus,\r\nto whom the Gallic war fell, was directed to levy troops, without\r\nadmitting any plea of immunity: nay, it is said, that even the rabble of\r\nhandicrafts, and those of sedentary trades, of all the worst qualified\r\nfor military service, were called out; and a vast army was collected at\r\nVeii, in readiness to meet the Gauls. It was thought proper not to\r\nproceed to a greater distance, lest the enemy might by some other route\r\narrive at the city without being observed. In the course of a few days\r\nit being ascertained, on a careful inquiry, that every thing on that\r\nside was quiet at the time; the whole force, which was to have opposed\r\nthe Gauls, was then turned against Privernum. Of the issue of the\r\nbusiness, there are two different accounts: some say, that the city was\r\ntaken by storm; and that Vitruvius fell alive into the hands [of the\r\nconquerors]: others maintain that the townsmen, to avoid the extremities\r\nof a storm, presenting the rod of peace, surrendered to the consul; and\r\nthat Vitruvius was delivered up by his troops. The senate, being\r\nconsulted with respect to Vitruvius and the Privernians, sent\r\ndirections, that the consul Plautius should demolish the walls of\r\nPrivernum, and, leaving a strong garrison there, come home to enjoy the\r\nhonour of a triumph; at the same time ordering that Vitruvius should be\r\nkept in prison, until the return of the consul, and that he should then\r\nbe beaten with rods, and put to death. His house, which stood on the\r\nPalatine hill, they commanded to be razed to the ground, and his effects\r\nto be devoted to Semo Sancus. With the money produced by the sale of\r\nthem, brazen globes were formed, and placed in the chapel of Sancus,\r\nopposite to the temple of Quirinus. As to the senate of Privernum, it\r\nwas decreed, that every person who had continued to act as a senator of\r\nPrivernum, after the revolt from the Romans, should reside on the\r\nfarther side of the Tiber, under the same restrictions as those of\r\nVelitræ. After the passing of these decrees, there was no further\r\nmention of the Privernians, until Plautius had triumphed. After the\r\ntriumph, Vitruvius, with his accomplices, having been put to death, the\r\nconsul thought that all being now fully gratified by the sufferings of\r\nthe guilty, allusion might be safely made to the business of the\r\nPrivernians, he spoke in the following manner: \"Conscript fathers, since\r\nthe authors of the revolt have received, both from the immortal gods and\r\nfrom you, the punishment so well merited, what do ye judge proper to be\r\ndone with respect to the guiltless multitude? For my part, although my\r\nduty consists rather in collecting the opinions of others than in\r\noffering my own, yet, when I reflect that the Privernians are situated\r\nin the neighbourhood of the Samnites, our peace with whom is exceedingly\r\nuncertain, I should wish, that as little ground of animosity as possible\r\nmay be left between them and us.\"\r\n\r\n21. The affair naturally admitted of a diversity of opinions, each,\r\nagreeably to his particular temper, recommending either severity or\r\nlenity; matters were still further perplexed by one of the Privernian\r\nambassadors, more mindful of the prospects to which he had been born,\r\nthan to the exigency of the present juncture: who being asked by one of\r\nthe advocates for severity, \"What punishment he thought the Privernians\r\ndeserved?\" answered, \"Such as those deserve who deem themselves worthy\r\nof liberty.\" The consul observing, that, by this stubborn answer, those\r\nwho were adverse to the cause of the Privernians were the more\r\nexasperated against them, and wishing, by a question of favourable\r\nimport, to draw from him a more conciliating reply, said to him, \"What\r\nif we remit the punishment, in what manner may we expect that ye will\r\nobserve the peace which shall be established between us?\" He replied,\r\n\"If the peace which ye grant us be a good one, both inviolable and\r\neternal; if bad, of no long continuance.\" Then indeed some exclaimed,\r\nthat the Privernian menaced them, and not in ambiguous terms; and that\r\nby such expressions peaceable states were incited to rebellion. But the\r\nmore reasonable part of the senate interpreted his answers more\r\nfavourably, and said, that \"the words they had heard were those of a\r\nman, and of a free-man. Could it be believed that any people, or even\r\nany individual, would remain, longer than necessity constrained, in a\r\nsituation which he felt painful? That peace was faithfully observed,\r\nonly when those at peace were voluntarily so; but that fidelity was not\r\nto be expected where they wished to establish slavery.\" In this opinion\r\nthey were led to concur, principally, by the consul himself, who\r\nfrequently observed to the consulars, who had proposed the different\r\nresolutions, in such a manner as to be heard by several, that \"surely\r\nthose men only who thought of nothing but liberty, were worthy of being\r\nmade Romans.\" They consequently both carried their cause in the senate;\r\nand, moreover, by direction of that body, a proposal was laid before the\r\npeople, that the freedom of the state should be granted to the\r\nPrivernians. The same year a colony of three hundred was sent to Anxur,\r\nand received two acres of land each.\r\n\r\n22. The year following, in which the consuls were Publius Plautius\r\nProculus and Publius Cornelius Scapula, was remarkable for no one\r\ntransaction, civil or military, except the sending of a colony to\r\nFregellæ, a district which had belonged to the Sidicinians, and\r\nafterwards to the Volscians; and a distribution of meat to the people,\r\nmade by Marcus Flavius, on occasion of the funeral of his mother. There\r\nwere many who represented, that, under the appearance of doing honour to\r\nhis parent, a deserved recompence was made to the people, for having\r\nacquitted him, when prosecuted by the ædiles on a charge of having\r\ndebauched a married woman. This distribution of meat intended as a\r\nreturn for favours shown on the trial, proved also the means of\r\nprocuring him the honour of a public office; for, at the next election,\r\nthough absent, he was preferred before the candidates who solicited in\r\nperson the tribuneship of the commons. The city of Palæpolis was\r\nsituated at no great distance from the spot where Neapolis now stands.\r\nThe two cities were inhabited by one people: these came from Cumæ, and\r\nthe Cumans derive their origin from Chalcis in Eubœa. By means of\r\nthe fleet in which they had been conveyed hither, they possessed great\r\npower on the coast of the sea, near which they dwelt. Having first\r\nlanded on the islands of Ænaria, and the Pithecusæ, they afterwards\r\nventured to transfer their settlement to the continent. This state,\r\nrelying both on their own strength, as well as on the treacherous nature\r\nof the alliance of the Samnites with the Romans; or, encouraged by the\r\nreport of a pestilence having attacked the city of Rome, committed\r\nvarious acts of hostility against the Romans settled in the Campanian\r\nand Falernian territories. Wherefore, in the succeeding consulate of\r\nLucius Cornelius, and Quintus Publilius Philo a second time, heralds\r\nbeing sent to Palæpolis to demand satisfaction, when a haughty answer\r\nwas returned by these Greeks, a race more magnanimous in words than in\r\naction, the people, in pursuance of the direction of the senate, ordered\r\nwar to be declared against the Palæpolitans. On settling the provinces\r\nbetween the consuls, the war against the Greeks fell to Publilius.\r\nCornelius, with another army, was appointed to watch the Samnites if\r\nthey should attempt any movement; but a report prevailed that they,\r\nanxiously expecting a revolt in Campania, intended to march their troops\r\nthither; that was judged by Cornelius the properest station for him.\r\n\r\n23. The senate received information, from both the consuls, that there\r\nwas very little hope of peace with the Samnites. Publilius informed\r\nthem, that two thousand soldiers from Nolæ, and four thousand of the\r\nSamnites, had been received into Palæpolis, a measure rather forced on\r\nthe Greeks by the Nolans than agreeable to their inclination. Cornelius\r\nwrote, that a levy of troops had been ordered, that all Samnium was in\r\nmotion, and that the neighbouring states of Privernum, Fundi, and\r\nFormiæ, were openly solicited to join them. When in consequence it was\r\nthought proper, that, before hostilities were commenced, ambassadors\r\nshould be sent to the Samnites, an insolent answer is returned by them;\r\nthey even went so far as to accuse the Romans of behaving injuriously\r\ntowards them; but, nevertheless, they took pains to clear themselves of\r\nthe charges made against them, asserting, that \"the Greeks were not\r\nassisted with either counsel or aid by their state, nor were the\r\nFundanians or Formians tampered with by them; for, if they were disposed\r\nto war, they had not the least reason to be diffident of their own\r\nstrength. However, they could not dissemble, that it gave great offence\r\nto the state of the Samnites, that Fregellæ, by them taken from the\r\nVolscians and demolished, should have been rebuilt by the Romans; and\r\nthat they should have established a colony within the territory of the\r\nSamnites, to which their colonists gave the name of Fregellæ. This\r\ninjury and affront, if not done away by the authors, they were\r\ndetermined themselves to remove, by every means in their power.\" When\r\none of the Roman ambassadors proposed to discuss the matter before their\r\ncommon allies and friends, their magistrate said, \"Why do we disguise\r\nour sentiments? Romans, no conferences of ambassadors, nor arbitration\r\nof any person whatever, can terminate our differences; but the plains of\r\nCampania, in which we must meet; our arms and the common fortune of war\r\nwill settle the point. Let our armies, therefore, meet between Capua and\r\nSuessula; and there let us decide, whether the Samnite or the Roman\r\nshall hold the sovereignty of Italy.\" To this the ambassadors of the\r\nRomans replied, \"that they would go, not whither their enemy called, but\r\nwhither their commanders should lead.\" In the mean time, Publilius, by\r\nseizing an advantageous post between Palæpolis and Neapolis, had cut off\r\nthat interchange of mutual aid, which they had hitherto afforded each\r\nother, according as either place was hard pressed. Accordingly, when\r\nboth the day of the elections approached, and as it was highly\r\ninexpedient for the public interest that Publilius should be called away\r\nwhen on the point of assailing the enemy's walls, and in daily\r\nexpectation of gaining possession of their city, application was made to\r\nthe tribunes, to recommend to the people the passing of an order, that\r\nPublilius Philo, when his year of office should expire, might continue\r\nin command, as pro-consul, until the war with the Greeks should be\r\nfinished. A letter was despatched to Lucius Cornelius, with orders to\r\nname a dictator; for it was not thought proper that the consul should be\r\nrecalled from the vigorous prosecution of the war now that he had\r\nentered into Samnium. He nominated Marcus Claudius Marcellus, who\r\nappointed Spurius Postumius master of the horse. The elections, however,\r\nwere not held by the dictator, because it became a question whether he\r\nhad been appointed under an irregularity; and the augurs being\r\nconsulted, pronounced that it appeared that the dictator's appointment\r\nwas defective. The tribunes inveighed against this proceeding as\r\ndangerous and dishonourable; \"for it was not probable,\" they said, \"that\r\nsuch defect could have been discovered, as the consul, rising in the\r\nnight, had nominated the dictator while every thing was still;[172] nor\r\nhad the said consul in any of his letters, either public or private,\r\nmade any mention of such a thing to any one; nor did any person whatever\r\ncome forward who said that he saw or heard any thing which could vitiate\r\nthe auspices. Neither could the augurs sitting at Rome divine what\r\ninauspicious circumstance had occurred to the consul in the camp. Who\r\ndid not plainly perceive, that the dictator's being a plebeian, was the\r\ndefect which the augurs had discovered?\" These and other arguments were\r\nurged in vain by the tribunes: the affair however ended in an\r\ninterregnum. At last, after the elections had been adjourned repeatedly\r\non one pretext or another, the fourteenth interrex, Lucius Æmilius,\r\nelected consuls Caius Pætelius, and Lucius Papirius Mugillanus, or\r\nCursor, as I find him named in some annals.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 172: Any noise happening during the taking of the auspices was\r\nreckoned inauspicious; hence _silentium_ signified among the augurs,\r\nevery circumstance being favourable.]\r\n\r\n24. It has been recorded, that in this year Alexandria in Egypt was\r\nfounded; and that Alexander, king of Epirus, being slain by a Lucanian\r\nexile, verified in the circumstances of his death the prediction of\r\nJupiter of Dodona. At the time when he was invited into Italy by the\r\nTarentines, a caution had been given him, \"to beware of the Acherusian\r\nwaters and the city Pandosia, for there were fixed the limits of his\r\ndestiny.\" For that reason he made the greater haste to pass over to\r\nItaly, in order to be at as great a distance as possible from the city\r\nPandosia in Epirus, and the river Acheron, which, after flowing through\r\nMolossis, runs into the lakes called Infernal, and is received into the\r\nThesprotian gulf. But, (as it frequently happens, that men, by\r\nendeavouring to shun their fate, run directly upon it,) after having\r\noften defeated the armies of Bruttium and Lucania, and taken Heraclea, a\r\ncolony of the Tarentines, Consentia and Metapontum from the Lucanians,\r\nTerina from the Bruttians, and several other cities of the Messapians\r\nand Lucanians; and having sent into Epirus three hundred illustrious\r\nfamilies, whom he intended to keep as hostages, he posted his troops on\r\nthree hills, which stood at a small distance from each other, not far\r\nfrom the city Pandosia, and close to the frontiers of the Bruttians and\r\nLucanians, in order that he might thence make incursions into every part\r\nof the enemy's country. At that time he kept about his person two\r\nhundred Lucanian exiles, as faithful attendants, but whose fidelity,\r\naccording to the general disposition of people of that description, was\r\never ready to follow the changes of fortune. When continual rains spread\r\nsuch an inundation over all the plains, as cut off from the three\r\nseparate divisions of the army all means of mutual aid, the two parties,\r\nin neither of which the king was present, were suddenly attacked and\r\noverpowered by the enemy, who, after putting them to the sword, employed\r\ntheir whole force in blockading the king himself. From this place the\r\nLucanian exiles sent emissaries to their countrymen, and stipulating a\r\nsafe return for themselves, promised to deliver the king, either alive\r\nor dead, into their power. But he, bravely resolving to make an\r\nextraordinary effort, at the head of a chosen band, broke through the\r\nmidst of their forces; engaged singly, and slew the general of the\r\nLucanians, and collecting together his men, who had been scattered in\r\nthe retreat, arrived at a river which pointed out his road by the ruins\r\nof a bridge which had been recently broken by the violence of the flood.\r\nHere, while the party was fording the river on a very uneven bottom, a\r\nsoldier, almost spent with fatigue and apprehension, cried out as a\r\nreflection on the odious name of it,--\"You are justly named Acheros\r\n(dismal):\" which expression reaching the king's ears, and instantly\r\nrecalling to his mind the fate denounced on him, he halted, hesitating\r\nwhether he should cross over or not. Then Sotimus, one of the royal band\r\nof youths which attended him, asking why he delayed in such a critical\r\nmoment, showed him that the Lucanians were watching an opportunity to\r\nperpetrate some act of treachery: whereupon the king, looking back, and\r\nseeing them coming towards him in a body, drew his sword, and pushed on\r\nhis horse through the middle of the river. When he had now reached the\r\nshallow, a Lucanian exile from a distance transfixed him with a javelin:\r\nafter his fall, the current carried down his lifeless body, with the\r\nweapon sticking in it, to the posts of the enemy: there a shocking\r\nmangling of it took place; for dividing it in the middle, they sent one\r\nhalf to Consentia, and kept the other, as a subject of mockery, to\r\nthemselves. While they were throwing darts and stones at it, a woman\r\nmixing with the crowd, who were enraged to a degree beyond the credible\r\nextent of human resentment, prevailed on them to stop for a moment. She\r\nthen told them with tears in her eyes that she had a husband and\r\nchildren, prisoners among the enemy; and that she hoped to be able with\r\nthe king's body, however disfigured, to ransom her friends: this put an\r\nend to their outrages. The remnants of his limbs were buried at\r\nConsentia, entirely through the care of the woman; and his bones were\r\nsent to Metapontum to the enemy, from whence they were conveyed to\r\nEpirus to his wife Cleopatra and his sister Olympias; the latter of whom\r\nwas the mother, the former the sister, of Alexander the Great. Such was\r\nthe melancholy end of Alexander of Epirus; of which, although fortune\r\ndid not allow him to engage in hostilities with the Romans, yet, as he\r\nwaged war in Italy, I have thought it proper to give this brief account.\r\nThis year, the fifth time since the building of the city, the\r\nlectisternium was performed at Rome for procuring the favour of the same\r\ndeities to whom it was addressed before.\r\n\r\n25. When the new consuls had, by order of the people, sent persons to\r\ndeclare war against the Samnites, and they themselves were making all\r\npreparations with greater energy than against the Greeks, a new\r\naccession of strength also came to them when expecting no such thing.\r\nThe Lucanians and Apulians, nations who, until that time, had no kind of\r\nintercourse with the Roman people, proposed an alliance with them,\r\npromising a supply of men and arms for the war: a treaty of friendship\r\nwas accordingly concluded. At the same time, their affairs went on\r\nsuccessfully in Samnium. Three towns fell into their hands, Allifæ,\r\nCallifæ, and Ruffrium; and the adjoining country to a great extent was,\r\non the first arrival of the consuls, laid entirely waste. Whilst the war\r\non this side was commenced with so much success, so the war in the other\r\nquarter where the Greeks were held besieged, now drew towards a\r\nconclusion. For, besides the communication between the two posts of the\r\nenemy being cut off, by the besiegers having possession of part of the\r\nworks through which it had been carried on, they now suffered within the\r\nwalls hardships far more grievous than those with which the enemy\r\nthreatened them, and as if made prisoners by their own garrison, they\r\nwere now subjected to the greatest indignities in the persons of their\r\nwives and children, and to such extremities as are generally felt on the\r\nsacking of cities. When, therefore, intelligence arrived that\r\nreinforcements were to come from Tarentum and from the Samnites, all\r\nagreed that there were more of the latter already within the walls than\r\nthey wished; but the young men of Tarentum, who were Greeks as well as\r\nthemselves, they earnestly longed for, as they hoped to be enabled by\r\ntheir means to oppose the Samnites and Nolans, no less than to resist\r\ntheir Roman enemies. At last a surrender to the Romans appeared to be\r\nthe lightest evil. Charilaus and Nymphius, the two principal men in the\r\nstate, consulting together on the subject, settled the part which each\r\nwas to act; it, was, that one should desert to the Roman general, and\r\nthe other stay behind to manage affairs in the city, so as to facilitate\r\nthe execution of their plan. Charilaus was the person who came to\r\nPublilius Philo; he told him that \"he had taken a resolution, which he\r\nhoped would prove advantageous, fortunate, and happy to the Palæpolitans\r\nand to the Roman people, of delivering the fortifications into his\r\nhands. Whether he should appear by that deed to have betrayed or\r\npreserved his country, depended on the honour of the Romans. That for\r\nhimself in particular, he neither stipulated nor requested any thing;\r\nbut, in behalf of the state, he requested rather than stipulated, that\r\nin case the design should succeed, the Roman people would consider more\r\nespecially the zeal and hazard with which it sought a renewal of their\r\nfriendship, than its folly and rashness in deviating from its duty.\" He\r\nwas commended by the general, and received a body of three thousand\r\nsoldiers, with which he was to seize on that part of the city which was\r\npossessed by the Samnites; this detachment was commanded by Lucius\r\nQuinctius, military tribune.\r\n\r\n26. At the same time also, Nymphius, on his part, artfully addressing\r\nhimself to the commander of the Samnites, prevailed upon him, as all the\r\ntroops of the Romans were employed either about Palæpolis or in Samnium,\r\nto allow him to sail round with the fleet to the territory of Rome,\r\nwhere he undertook to ravage, not only the sea-coast, but the country\r\nadjoining the very city. But, in order to avoid observation, it was\r\nnecessary, he told him, to set out by night, and to launch the ships\r\nimmediately. That this might be effected with the greater despatch, all\r\nthe young Samnites, except the necessary guards of the city, were sent\r\nto the shore. While Nymphius wasted the time there, giving contradictory\r\norders, designedly, to create confusion, which was increased by the\r\ndarkness, and by the crowd, which was so numerous as to obstruct each\r\nother's operations, Charilaus, according to the plan concerted, was\r\nadmitted by his associates into the city; and have filled the higher\r\nparts of it with Roman soldiers, he ordered them to raise a shout; on\r\nwhich the Greeks, who had received previous directions from their\r\nleaders, kept themselves quiet. The Nolans fled through the opposite\r\npart of the town, by the road leading to Nola. The flight of the\r\nSamnites, who were shut out from the city, was easier, but had a more\r\ndisgraceful appearance; for they returned to their homes without arms,\r\nstripped, and destitute of every thing; all, in short, belonging to them\r\nbeing left with their enemies; so that they were objects of ridicule,\r\nnot only to foreigners, but even to their own countrymen. I know that\r\nthere is another account of this matter, according to which the town is\r\nrepresented to have been betrayed by the Samnites; but I have this\r\naccount on the authority most worthy of credit; besides, the treaty of\r\nNeapolis, for to that place the seat of government of the Greeks was\r\nthen transferred, renders it more probable that the renewal of\r\nfriendship was voluntary on their side. A triumph was decreed to\r\nPublilius, because people were well convinced that the enemy, reduced by\r\nthe siege, had adopted terms of submission. These two extraordinary\r\nincidents, which never before occurred in any case, befell this man: a\r\nprolongation of command never before granted to any one; and a triumph\r\nafter the expiration of his office.\r\n\r\n27. Another war soon after arose with the Greeks of the other coast. For\r\nthe Tarentines having, for a considerable time, buoyed up the state of\r\nPalæpolis with delusive hopes of assistance, when they understood that\r\nthe Romans had gotten possession of that city, as if they were the\r\npersons who had suffered the disappointment, and not the authors of it,\r\nthey inveighed against the Palæpolitans, and became furious in their\r\nanger and malice towards the Romans; on this account also, because\r\ninformation was brought that the Lucanians and Apulians had submitted to\r\nthe Roman people; for a treaty of alliance had been this year concluded\r\nwith both these nations. \"The business,\" they observed, \"was now brought\r\nalmost to their doors; and that the matter would soon come to this, that\r\nthe Romans must either be dealt with as enemies, or received as masters:\r\nthat, in fact, their interests were involved in the war of the Samnites,\r\nand in its issue. That that was the only nation which continued to make\r\nopposition; and that with power very inadequate, since the Lucanians\r\nleft them: these however might yet be brought back, and induced to\r\nrenounce the Roman alliance, if proper skill were used in sowing\r\ndissension between them.\" These reasonings being readily adopted, by\r\npeople who wished for a change, some young Lucanians of considerable\r\nnote among their countrymen, but devoid of honour, were procured for\r\nmoney; these having lacerated each other's persons with stripes, after\r\nthey had come naked into a public meeting of their countrymen, exclaimed\r\nthat, because they had ventured to go into the Roman camp, they had been\r\nthus beaten with rods, by order of the consul, and had hardly escaped\r\nthe loss of their heads. A circumstance, so shocking in its nature,\r\ncarrying strong proofs of the ill-treatment, none of artifice, the\r\npeople were so irritated, that, by their clamours, they compelled the\r\nmagistrates to call together the senate; and some standing round that\r\nassembly, insisted on a declaration of war against the Romans, others\r\nran different ways to rouse to arms the multitude residing in the\r\ncountry. Thus the tumult hurrying into imprudence the minds even of\r\nrational men, a decree was passed, that the alliance with the Samnites\r\nshould be renewed, and ambassadors sent for that purpose. Because this\r\nso sudden a proceeding was totally devoid of any obvious cause for its\r\nadoption, and consequently was little relied on for its sincerity; they\r\nwere, however, obliged both to give hostages, and also to receive\r\ngarrisons into their fortified places; and they, blinded by fraud and\r\nresentment, refused no terms. In a little time after, on the authors of\r\nthe false charges removing to Tarentum, the whole imposition came to\r\nlight. But as they had given all power out of their own hands, nothing\r\nwas left them but unavailing repentance.\r\n\r\n28. This year there arose, as it were, a new era of liberty to the Roman\r\ncommons; in this that a stop was put to the practice of confining\r\ndebtors. This alteration of the law was effected in consequence of the\r\nlust and signal cruelty of one usurer. His name was Lucius Papirius. To\r\nhim one Caius Publilius having surrendered his person to be confined for\r\na debt due by his father, his youth and beauty, which ought to have\r\nexcited commiseration, operated on the other's mind as incentives to\r\nlust and insult. He first attempted to seduce the young man by impure\r\ndiscourses, considering the bloom of his youth his own adventitious\r\ngain; but finding that his ears were shocked at their infamous tendency,\r\nhe then endeavoured to terrify him by threats, and reminded him\r\nfrequently of his situation. At last, convinced of his resolution to act\r\nconformably to his honourable birth, rather than to his present\r\ncondition, he ordered him to be stripped and scourged. When with the\r\nmarks of the rods imprinted in his flesh the youth rushed out into the\r\npublic street, loudly complaining of the depravedness and inhumanity of\r\nthe usurer; a vast number of people, moved by compassion for his early\r\nage, and indignation at his barbarous treatment, reflecting at the same\r\ntime on their own lot and that of their children, flocked together into\r\nthe forum, and from thence in a body to the senate-house. When the\r\nconsuls were obliged by the sudden tumult to call a meeting of the\r\nsenate, the people, falling at the feet of each of the senators, as they\r\nwere going into the senate-house, presented to their view the lacerated\r\nback of the youth. On that day, in consequence of the outrageous conduct\r\nof an individual, the strongest bonds of credit were broken; and the\r\nconsuls were commanded to propose to the people, that no person should\r\nbe held in fetters or stocks, except convicted of a crime, and in order\r\nto punishment; but that, for money due, the goods of the debtor, not his\r\nperson, should be answerable. Thus the confined debtors were released;\r\nand provision made, for the time to come, that they should not be liable\r\nto confinement.\r\n\r\n29. In the course of this year, while the war with the Samnites was\r\nsufficient in itself to give full employment to the senate, besides the\r\nsudden defection of the Lucanians, and the Tarentines, the promoters of\r\nthe defection, [another source of uneasiness] was added in a union\r\nformed by the state of the Vestinians with the Samnites. Which event,\r\nthough it continued, during the present year, to be the general subject\r\nof conversation, without coming under any public discussion, appeared so\r\nimportant to the consuls of the year following, Lucius Furius Camillus a\r\nsecond time, and Junius Brutus Scæva, that it was the first business\r\nwhich they proposed to the consideration of the state. And though the\r\nmatter was still recent, still great perplexity seized the senate, as\r\nthey dreaded equally the consequences, either of passing it over, or of\r\ntaking it up; lest, on the one hand, impunity might stir up the\r\nneighbouring states with wantonness and arrogance; and, on the other,\r\npunishment inflicted on them by force of arms, and dread of immediate\r\ndanger, might produce the same effect by exciting resentment. And the\r\nwhole body, too, was in every way equal in strength to the Samnites,\r\nbeing composed of the Marsians, the Pelignians, and the Marrusinians;\r\nall of whom would have to be encountered as enemies, if the Vestinians\r\nwere to be interfered with. However, that side prevailed which might, at\r\nthe time, seem to have more spirit than prudence; but the event proved\r\nthat fortune assists the brave. The people, in pursuance of the\r\ndirection of the senate, ordered war against the Vestinians; that\r\nprovince fell by lot to Junius, Samnium to Camillus. Armies were led to\r\nboth places, and by carefully guarding the frontiers, the enemy were\r\nprevented from joining their forces. But the other consul, Lucius\r\nFurius, on whom the principal weight of the business rested, was\r\nwithdrawn by chance from the war, being seized with a severe sickness.\r\nBeing therefore ordered to nominate a dictator to conduct the business,\r\nhe nominated Lucius Papirius Cursor, the most celebrated general, by\r\nfar, of any in that age, who appointed Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus\r\nmaster of the horse: a pair of commanders distinguished for their\r\nexploits in war; more so, however, for a quarrel between themselves, and\r\nwhich proceeded almost to violence. The other consul, in the territory\r\nof the Vestinians, carried on operations of various kinds; and, in all,\r\nwas uniformly successful. For he both utterly laid waste their lands,\r\nand, by spoiling and burning their houses and corn, compelled them to\r\ncome to an engagement; and, in one battle, he reduced the strength of\r\nthe Vestinians to such a degree, though not without loss on his own\r\nside, that the enemy not only fled to their camp, but, fearing even to\r\ntrust to the rampart and trench, dispersed from thence into the several\r\ntowns, in hopes of finding security in the situation and fortifications\r\nof their cities. At last, having undertaken to reduce their towns by\r\nforce, amid the great ardour of the soldiers, and their resentment for\r\nthe wounds which they had received, (hardly one of them having come out\r\nof the battle unhurt,) he took Cutina by scalade, and afterwards\r\nCingilia. The spoil of both cities he gave to the soldiers, in\r\nconsideration of their having bravely surmounted the obstruction both of\r\ngates and walls.\r\n\r\n30. The commanders entered Samnium under uncertain auspices; an\r\ninformality which pointed, not at the event of war, for that was\r\nprosperous, but at the furious passions and the quarrels which broke out\r\nbetween the leaders. For Papirius the dictator, returning to Rome in\r\norder to take the auspices anew, in consequence of a caution received\r\nfrom the aruspex, left strict orders with the master of the horse to\r\nremain in his post, and not to engage in battle during his absence.\r\nAfter the departure of the dictator, Fabius having discovered by his\r\nscouts that the enemy were in as unguarded a state as if there was not a\r\nsingle Roman in Samnium, the high-spirited youth, (either conceiving\r\nindignation at the sole authority in every point appearing to be lodged\r\nin the hands of the dictator, or induced by the opportunity of striking\r\nan important blow,) having made the necessary preparations and\r\ndispositions, marched to a place called Imbrinium, and there fought a\r\nbattle with the Samnites. His success in the fight was such, that there\r\nwas no one circumstance which could have been improved to more\r\nadvantage, if the dictator had been present. The leader was not wanting\r\nto the soldiers, nor the soldiers to their leader. The cavalry too,\r\n(finding, after repeated charges, that they could not break the ranks,)\r\nby the advice of Lucius Cominius, a military tribune, pulled off the\r\nbridles from their horses and spurred them on so furiously, that no\r\npower could withstand them; forcing their way through the thickest of\r\nthe enemy, they bore down every thing before them; and the infantry\r\nseconding the charge, the whole body was thrown into confusion. Twenty\r\nthousand of the enemy are said to have fallen on that day. I have\r\nauthority for saying that there were two battles fought during the\r\ndictator's absence, and two victories obtained; but, according to the\r\nmost ancient writers, only this one is found, and in some histories the\r\nwhole transaction is omitted. The master of the horse getting possession\r\nof abundance of spoils, in consequence of the great numbers slain,\r\ncollected the arms into a huge heap, and burned them; either in\r\npursuance of a vow to some of the gods, or, if we choose to credit the\r\nauthority of Fabius, it was done on this account, that the dictator\r\nmight not reap the fruits of his glory, inscribe his name on them, or\r\ncarry the spoils in triumph. His letters also, containing an account of\r\nthe success, being sent to the senate, not to the dictator, showed\r\nplainly that he wished not to impart to him any share of the honour; who\r\ncertainly viewed the proceeding in this light, for while others rejoiced\r\nat the victory obtained, he showed only surliness and anger; insomuch\r\nthat, immediately dismissing the senate, he hastened out of the\r\nsenate-house, and frequently repeated with warmth, that the legions of\r\nthe Samnites were not more effectually vanquished and overthrown by the\r\nmaster of the horse, than were the dictatorial dignity and military\r\ndiscipline, if such contempt of orders escaped with impunity. Thus,\r\nbreathing resentment and menaces, he set out for the camp; but, though\r\nhe travelled with all possible expedition, he was unable, however, to\r\noutstrip the report of his coming. For messengers had started from the\r\ncity before him, who brought intelligence that the dictator was coming,\r\neager for vengeance, and in almost every second sentence applauding the\r\nconduct of Titus Manlius.\r\n\r\n31. Fabius instantly called an assembly, and entreated the soldiers to\r\n\"show the same courage in protecting him, under whose conduct and\r\nauspices they had conquered, from the outrageous cruelty of the\r\ndictator, which they had so lately displayed in defending the\r\ncommonwealth from its most inveterate enemies. He was now coming,\" he\r\ntold them, \"frantic with envy; enraged at another's bravery and success,\r\nhe was mad, because, in his absence, the business of the public had been\r\nexecuted, with remarkable success; and if he could change the fortune of\r\nthe engagement, would wish the Samnites in possession of victory rather\r\nthan the Romans. He talked much of contempt of orders; as if his\r\nprohibition of fighting were not dictated by the same motive, which\r\ncaused his vexation at the fight having taken place. He wished to\r\nshackle the valour of others through envy, and meant to take away the\r\nsoldiers' arms when they were most eager for action, and that no use\r\nmight be made of them in his absence: he was further enraged too,\r\nbecause without Lucius Papirius the soldiers were not without hands or\r\narms, and because Quintus Fabius considered himself as master of the\r\nhorse, not as a beadle to the dictator. How would he have behaved, had\r\nthe issue of the fight been unfortunate; which, through the chances of\r\nwar and the uncertainty of military operations, might have been the\r\ncase; since now, when the enemy has been vanquished, (as completely,\r\nindeed, as if that leader's own singular talents had been employed in\r\nthe matter,) he yet threatens the master of the horse with punishment?\r\nNor is he more incensed against the master of the horse, than against\r\nthe military tribunes, the centurions, and the soldiers. On all, he\r\nwould vent his rage if he could; and because that is not in his power,\r\nhe vents it on one. Envy, like flame, soars upwards; aims at the summit;\r\nthat he makes his attack on the head of the business, on the leader. If\r\nhe could put him out of the way, together with the glory of the service\r\nperformed, he would then lord it, like a conqueror over vanquished\r\ntroops; and, without scruple, practise against the soldiers what he had\r\nbeen allowed to act against their commander. That they should,\r\ntherefore, in his cause, support the general liberty of all. If the\r\ndictator perceived among the troops the same unanimity in justifying\r\ntheir victory that they had displayed in the battle, and that all\r\ninterested themselves in the safety of one, it would bend his temper to\r\nmilder counsels. In fine,\" he told them, \"that he committed his life,\r\nand all his interests, to their honour and to their courage.\"\r\n\r\n32. His speech was received with the loudest acclamations from every\r\npart of the assembly, bidding him \"have courage; for while the Roman\r\nlegions were in being, no man should offer him violence.\" Not long\r\nafter, the dictator arrived, and instantly summoned an assembly by sound\r\nof trumpet. Then silence being made, a crier cited Quintus Fabius,\r\nmaster of the horse, and as soon as, on the lower ground, he had\r\napproached the tribunal, the dictator said, \"Quintus Fabius, I demand of\r\nyou, when the authority of dictator is acknowledged to be supreme, and\r\nis submitted to by the consuls, officers endowed with regal power; and\r\nlikewise by the prætors, created under the same auspices with consuls;\r\nwhether or no you think it reasonable that it should not meet obedience\r\nfrom a master of the horse? I also ask you whether, when I knew that I\r\nset out from home under uncertain auspices, the safety of the\r\ncommonwealth ought to have been endangered by me, whilst the omens were\r\nconfused, or whether the auspices ought to be newly taken, so that\r\nnothing might be done while the will of the gods remained doubtful? And\r\nfurther, when a religious scruple was of such a nature as to hinder the\r\ndictator from acting, whether the master of the horse could be exempt\r\nfrom it and at liberty? But why do I ask these questions, when, though I\r\nhad gone without leaving any orders, your own judgment ought to have\r\nbeen regulated according to what you could discover of my intention? Why\r\ndo you not answer? Did I not forbid you to act, in any respect, during\r\nmy absence? Did I not forbid you to engage the enemy? Yet, in contempt\r\nof these my orders, while the auspices were uncertain, while the omens\r\nwere confused, contrary to the practice of war, contrary to the\r\ndiscipline of our ancestors, and contrary to the authority of the gods,\r\nyou dared to enter on the fight. Answer to these questions proposed to\r\nyou. On any other matter utter not a word. Lictor, draw near him.\" To\r\neach of these particulars, Fabius, finding it no easy matter to answer,\r\nat one time remonstrated against the same person acting as accuser and\r\njudge, in a cause which affected his very existence; at another, he\r\nasserted that his life should sooner be forced from him, than the glory\r\nof his past services; clearing himself and accusing the other by turns;\r\nso then Papirius' anger blazing out with fresh fury, he ordered the\r\nmaster of the horse to be stripped, and the rods and axes to be got\r\nready. Fabius, imploring the protection of the soldiers, while the\r\nlictors were tearing his garments, betook himself to the quarters of the\r\nveterans, who were already raising a commotion in the assembly: from\r\nthem the uproar spread through the whole body; in one place the voice of\r\nsupplication was heard; in another, menaces. Those who happened to stand\r\nnearest to the tribunal, because, being under the eyes of the general,\r\nthey could easily be known, entreated him to spare the master of the\r\nhorse, and not in him to condemn the whole army. The remoter parts of\r\nthe assembly, and the crowd collected round Fabius, railed at the\r\nunrelenting spirit of the dictator, and were not far from mutiny; nor\r\nwas even the tribunal perfectly quiet. The lieutenants-general standing\r\nround the general's seat besought him to adjourn the business to the\r\nnext day, and to allow time to his anger, and room for consideration;\r\nrepresenting that \"the indiscretion of Fabius had been sufficiently\r\nrebuked; his victory sufficiently disgraced; and they begged him not to\r\nproceed to the extreme of severity; not to brand with ignominy a youth\r\nof extraordinary merit, or his father, a man of most illustrious\r\ncharacter, together with the whole family of the Fabii.\" When they made\r\nbut little impression either by their prayers or arguments, they desired\r\nhim to observe the violent ferment of the assembly, and told him that\r\n\"while the soldiers' tempers were heated to such a degree, it became not\r\neither his age or his wisdom to kindle them into a flame, and afford\r\nmatter for a mutiny; that no one would lay the blame of such an event on\r\nQuintus Fabius, who only deprecated punishment; but on the dictator, if,\r\nblinded by resentment, he should, by an ill-judged contest, draw on\r\nhimself the fury of the multitude: and lest he should think that they\r\nacted from motives of regard to Quintus Fabius, they were ready to make\r\noath that, in their judgment, it was not for the interest of the\r\ncommonwealth that Quintus Fabius should be punished at that time.\"\r\n\r\n33. When by these expostulations they rather irritated the dictator\r\nagainst themselves, than appeased his anger against the master of the\r\nhorse, the lieutenants-general were ordered to go down from the\r\ntribunal; and after several vain attempts were made to procure silence\r\nby means of a crier, the noise and tumult being so great that neither\r\nthe voice of the dictator himself, nor that of his apparitors, could be\r\nheard; night, as in the case of a battle, put an end to the contest. The\r\nmaster of the horse was ordered to attend on the day following; but when\r\nall assured him that Papirius, being agitated and exasperated in the\r\ncourse of the present contention, would proceed against him with greater\r\nviolence, he fled privately from the camp to Rome; where, by the advice\r\nof his father, Marcus Fabius, who had been three times consul, and\r\nlikewise dictator, he immediately called a meeting of the senate. While\r\nhe was strenuously complaining before the fathers of the rage and\r\ninjustice of the dictator, on a sudden was heard the noise of lictors\r\nbefore the senate-house, clearing the way, and Papirius himself arrived,\r\nfull of resentment, having followed, with a guard of light horse, as\r\nsoon as he heard that the other had quitted the camp. The contention\r\nthen began anew, and the dictator ordered Fabius to be seized. Where,\r\nwhen his unrelenting spirit persisted in its purpose, notwithstanding\r\nthe united intercessions of the principal patricians, and of the whole\r\nsenate, Fabius, the father, then said, \"Since neither the authority of\r\nthe senate has any weight with you; nor my age, which you wish to render\r\nchildless; nor the noble birth and merit of a master of the horse,\r\nnominated by yourself; nor prayers which have often mitigated the rage\r\nof an enemy, and which appease the wrath of the gods; I call upon the\r\ntribunes of the commons for support, and appeal to the people; and since\r\nyou decline the judgment of your own army, as well as of the senate, I\r\ncall you before a judge who must certainly be allowed, though no other\r\nshould, to possess more power and authority than yourself, though\r\ndictator. I shall see whether you will submit to an appeal, to which\r\nTullus Hostilius, a Roman king, submitted.\" They proceeded directly from\r\nthe senate-house to the assembly; where, being arrived, the dictator\r\nattended by few, the master of the horse by all the people of the first\r\nrank in a body, Papirius commanded him to be taken from the rostrum to\r\nthe lower ground; his father, following him, said, \"You do well in\r\nordering us to be brought down to a place where even as private persons\r\nwe have liberty of speech.\" At first, instead of regular speeches,\r\nnothing but altercation was heard; at length, the indignation of old\r\nFabius, and the strength of his voice, got the better of noise, while he\r\nreproached Papirius with arrogance and cruelty. \"He himself,\" he said,\r\n\"had been dictator at Rome; and no man, not even the lowest plebeian, or\r\ncenturion, or soldier, had been outraged by him. But Papirius sought for\r\nvictory and triumph over a Roman commander, as over the generals of the\r\nenemy. What an immense difference between the moderation of the\r\nancients, and modern oppression and cruelty. Quinctius Cincinnatus when\r\ndictator exercised no further severity on Lucius Minucius the consul,\r\nalthough rescued by him from a siege, than leaving him at the head of\r\nthe army, in the quality of lieutenant-general, instead of consul.\r\nMarcus Furius Camillus, in the case of Lucius Furius, who, in contempt\r\nof his great age and authority, had fought a battle with a most\r\ndisgraceful result, not only restrained his anger at the time so as to\r\nwrite no unfavourable representation of his conduct to the people or the\r\nsenate; but after returning home, when the patricians gave him a power\r\nof electing from among his colleagues whoever he might approve as an\r\nassociate with himself in the command, chose that very man in\r\npreference to all the other consular tribunes. Nay, that not even the\r\nresentment of the people, with whom lay the supreme power in all cases,\r\nwas ever exercised with greater severity towards those who, through\r\nrashness and ignorance, had occasioned the loss of armies, than the\r\nfining them in a sum of money. Until that day, a capital prosecution for\r\nill conduct in war had never been instituted against any commander, but\r\nnow generals of the Roman people when victorious, and meriting the most\r\nhonourable triumphs, are threatened with rods and axes; a treatment\r\nwhich would not have been deemed allowable, even towards those who had\r\nbeen defeated by an enemy. What would his son have to suffer, if he had\r\noccasioned the loss of the army? if he had been routed, put to flight,\r\nand driven out of his camp? To what greater length could his resentment\r\nand violence be stretched, than to scourge him, and put him to death?\r\nHow was it consistent with reason, that through the means of Quintus\r\nFabius, the state should be filled with joy, exulting in victory, and\r\noccupied in thanksgivings and congratulations; while at the same time,\r\nhe who had given occasion to the temples of the gods being thrown open,\r\ntheir altars yet smoking with sacrifices, and loaded with honours and\r\nofferings, should be stripped naked, and torn with stripes in the sight\r\nof the Roman people; within view of the Capitol and citadel, and of\r\nthose gods not in vain invoked in two different battles? With what\r\ntemper would the army which had conquered under his conduct and auspices\r\nhave borne it? What mourning would there be in the Roman camp! what joy\r\namong their enemies!\" This speech he accompanied with an abundant flow\r\nof tears; uniting reproaches and complaints, imploring the aid both of\r\ngods and men, and warmly embracing his son.\r\n\r\n34. On his side stood the majesty of the senate, the favour of the\r\npeople, the support of the tribunes, and regard for the absent army. On\r\nthe other side were urged the inviolable authority of the Roman\r\ngovernment and military discipline; the edict of the dictator, always\r\nobserved as the mandate of a deity; the orders of Manlius, and his\r\npostponing even parental affection to public utility. \"The same also,\"\r\nsaid the dictator, \"was the conduct of Lucius Brutus, the founder of\r\nRoman liberty, in the case of his two sons. That now fathers were\r\nbecome indulgent, and the aged indifferent in the case of the authority\r\nof others being despised, and indulge the young in the subversion of\r\nmilitary order, as if it were a matter of trifling consequence. For his\r\npart, however, he would persevere in his purpose, and would not remit\r\nthe smallest part of the punishment justly due to a person who fought\r\ncontrary to his orders, while the rites of religion were imperfectly\r\nexecuted, and the auspices uncertain. Whether the majesty of the supreme\r\nauthority was to be perpetual or not, depended not on him; but Lucius\r\nPapirius would not diminish aught of its rights. He wished that the\r\ntribunitian office, inviolate itself, would not by its interposition\r\nviolate the authority of the Roman government; nor the Roman people, to\r\ntheir own detriment particularly, annihilate the dictator and the rights\r\nof the dictatorship together. But if this should be the case, not Lucius\r\nPapirius but the tribunes and the people would be blamed by posterity in\r\nvain; when military discipline being once dissolved, the soldier would\r\nno longer obey the orders of the centurion, the centurion those of the\r\ntribune, the tribune those of the lieutenant-general, the\r\nlieutenant-general those of the consul, nor the master of the horse\r\nthose of the dictator. No one would then pay any deference to men, no,\r\nnor even to the gods. Neither edicts of generals nor auspices would be\r\nobserved. The soldiers, without leave of absence, would straggle at\r\nrandom through the lands of friends and of foes; and regardless of their\r\noath would, influenced solely by a wanton humour, quit the service\r\nwhenever they might choose. The standards would be unattended and\r\nforsaken: the men would neither assemble in pursuance of orders, nor\r\nwould any distinction be made as to fighting by night or by day, on\r\nfavourable or unfavourable ground, by order or without the orders of\r\nthe general; nor would they observe standards or ranks; the service,\r\ninstead of being solemn and sacred, would be confused and the result of\r\nmere chance, like that of freebooters. Render yourselves then, tribunes\r\nof the commons, accountable for all these evils to all future ages.\r\nExpose your own persons to these heavy imputations in defence of the\r\nlicentious conduct of Quintus Fabius.\"\r\n\r\n35. The tribunes now confounded, and more anxiously concerned at their\r\nown situation than at his for whom their support was sought, were freed\r\nfrom this embarrassment by the Roman people unanimously having recourse\r\nto prayers and entreaties, that the dictator would, for their sakes,\r\nremit the punishment of the master of the horse. The tribunes likewise,\r\nfollowing the example set them of employing entreaties, earnestly\r\nbeseech the dictator to pardon human error, to consider the immaturity\r\nof the offender's age; that he had suffered sufficiently; and now the\r\nyouth himself, now his father, Marcus Fabius, disclaiming further\r\ncontest, fell at the dictator's knees and deprecated his wrath. Then the\r\ndictator, after causing silence, said, \"Romans, it is well. Military\r\ndiscipline has prevailed; the majesty of government has prevailed; both\r\nwhich were in danger of ceasing this day to exist. Quintus Fabius, who\r\nfought contrary to the order of his commander, is not acquitted of\r\nguilt; but after being condemned as guilty, is granted as a boon to the\r\nRoman people; is granted to the college of tribunes, supporting him with\r\ntheir prayers, not with the regular power of their office. Live, Quintus\r\nFabius, more happy in this united sympathy of the state for your\r\npreservation, than in the victory in which you lately exulted. Live,\r\nafter having ventured on such an act, as your father himself, had he\r\nbeen in the place of Lucius Papirius, would not have pardoned. With me\r\nyou shall be reconciled whenever you wish it. To the Roman people, to\r\nwhom you owe your life, you can perform no greater service than to let\r\nthis day teach you a sufficient lesson to enable you to submit to lawful\r\ncommands, both in war and peace.\" He then declared, that he no longer\r\ndetained the master of the horse, and as he retired from the rostrum,\r\nthe senate being greatly rejoiced, and the people still more so,\r\ngathered round him and escorted him, on one hand commending the\r\ndictator, on the other congratulating the master of the horse; while it\r\nwas considered that the authority of military command was confirmed no\r\nless effectually by the danger of Quintus Fabius than the lamentable\r\npunishment of young Manlius. It so happened, that, through the course of\r\nthat year, as often as the dictator left the army the Samnites were in\r\nmotion: but Marcus Valerius, the lieutenant-general who commanded in the\r\ncamp, had Quintus Fabius before his eyes for an example, not to fear any\r\nviolence of the enemy, so much as the unrelenting anger of the dictator.\r\nSo that when a body of his foragers fell into an ambuscade and were cut\r\nto pieces in disadvantageous ground, it was generally believed that the\r\nlieutenant-general could have given them assistance if he had not been\r\nheld in dread by his rigorous orders. The resentment for this also\r\nalienated the affections of the soldiery from the dictator, already\r\nincensed against him because he had been implacable towards Quintus\r\nFabius, and because he had granted him pardon at the intercession of the\r\nRoman people, a thing which he had refused to their entreaties.\r\n\r\n36. The dictator, having appointed Lucius Papirius Crassus, as master of\r\nthe horse, to the command of the city, and prohibited Quintus Fabius\r\nfrom acting in any case as magistrate, returned to the camp; where his\r\narrival brought neither any great joy to his countrymen, nor any degree\r\nof terror to the enemy: for on the day following, either not knowing\r\nthat the dictator had arrived, or little regarding whether he were\r\npresent or absent, they approached his camp in order of battle. Of such\r\nimportance, however, was that single man, Lucius Papirius, that had the\r\nzeal of the soldiers seconded the dispositions of the commander, no\r\ndoubt was entertained that an end might have been put that day to the\r\nwar with the Samnites; so judiciously did he draw up his army with\r\nrespect to situation and reserves, in such a manner did he strengthen\r\nthem with every advantage of military skill: but the soldiers exerted no\r\nvigour; and designedly kept from conquering, in order to injure the\r\nreputation of their leader. Of the Samnites, however, very many were\r\nslain; and great numbers of the Romans wounded. The experienced\r\ncommander quickly perceived the circumstance which prevented his\r\nsuccess, and that it would be necessary to moderate his temper, and to\r\nmingle mildness with austerity. Accordingly, attended by the\r\nlieutenants-general, going round to the wounded soldiers, thrusting his\r\nhead into their tents, and asking them, one by one, how they were in\r\nhealth; then, mentioning them by name, he gave them in charge to the\r\nofficers, tribunes, and præfects. This behaviour, popular in itself, he\r\nmaintained with such dexterity, that by his attention to their recovery\r\nhe gradually gained their affection; nor did any thing so much\r\ncontribute towards their recovery as the circumstance of this attention\r\nbeing received with gratitude. The army being restored to health, he\r\ncame to an engagement with the enemy; and both himself and the troops,\r\nbeing possessed with full confidence of success, he so entirely defeated\r\nand dispersed the Samnites, that that was the last day they met the\r\ndictator in the field. The victorious army, afterwards, directed its\r\nmarch wherever a prospect of booty invited, and traversed the enemies'\r\nterritories, encountering not a weapon, nor any opposition, either\r\nopenly or by stratagem. It added to their alacrity, that the dictator\r\nhad, by proclamation, given the whole spoil to the soldiers; so that\r\nthey were animated not only by the public quarrel, but by their private\r\nemolument. Reduced by these losses, the Samnites sued to the dictator\r\nfor peace, and, after they had engaged to supply each of his soldiers\r\nwith a suit of clothes and a year's pay, being ordered to apply to the\r\nsenate, they answered, that they would follow the dictator, committing\r\ntheir cause wholly to his integrity and honour. On this the troops were\r\nwithdrawn out of Samnium.\r\n\r\n37. The dictator entered the city in triumph; and, though desirous of\r\nresigning his office immediately, yet, by order of the senate, he held\r\nit until the consuls were elected: these were Caius Sulpicius Longus a\r\nsecond time, and Quintus Æmilius Cerretanus. The Samnites, without\r\nfinishing the treaty of peace, the terms being still in negotiation,\r\nbrought home with them a truce for a year. Nor was even that faithfully\r\nobserved; so strongly was their inclination for war excited, on hearing\r\nthat Papirius was gone out of office. In this consulate of Caius\r\nSulpicius and Quintus Æmilius, (some histories have Aulius,) to the\r\nrevolt of the Samnites was added a new war with the Apulians. Armies\r\nwere sent against both. The Samnites fell by lot to Sulpicius, the\r\nApulians to Æmilius. Some writers say, that this war was not waged with\r\nthe Apulians, but that the allied states of that nation were defended\r\nagainst the violence and injustice of the Samnites. But the\r\ncircumstances of the Samnites, who could with difficulty, at that\r\nperiod, support a war in which themselves were engaged, render it more\r\nprobable that they did not make war on the Apulians, but that both\r\nnations were in arms against the Romans at the same time. However, no\r\nmemorable event occurred. The lands of the Apulians and of Samnium were\r\nutterly laid waste; but in neither quarter were the enemy to be found.\r\nAt Rome, an alarm, which happened in the night, suddenly roused the\r\npeople from their sleep, in such a fright, that the Capitol and citadel,\r\nthe walls and gates, were all filled with men in arms. But after they\r\nhad called all to their posts, and run together in bodies, in every\r\nquarter, when day approached, neither the author nor cause of the alarm\r\ncould be discovered. This year, in pursuance to the advice of Flavius,\r\nthe Tusculans were brought to a trial before the people. Marcus Flavius,\r\na tribune of the commons, proposed, that punishment should be inflicted\r\non those of the Tusculans, \"by whose advice and assistance the\r\nVeliternians and Privernians had made war on the Roman people.\" The\r\nTusculans, with their wives and children, came to Rome. The whole party\r\nin mourning habits, like persons under accusation, went round the\r\ntribes, throwing themselves at the feet of the citizens. The compassion\r\nthus excited operated more effectually towards procuring them pardon,\r\nthan all their arguments did towards clearing them of guilt. Every one\r\nof the tribes, except the Pollian, negatived the proposition. The\r\nsentence of the Pollian tribe was, that the grown-up males should be\r\nbeaten and put to death, and their wives and children sold by auction,\r\naccording to the rules of war. It appears that the resentment which rose\r\nagainst the advisers of so rigorous a measure, was retained in memory by\r\nthe Tusculans down to the age of our fathers; and that hardly any\r\ncandidate of the Pollian tribe could, ever since, gain the votes of the\r\nPapirian.\r\n\r\n38. On the following year, in the consulate of Quintus Fabius and Lucius\r\nFulvius, Aulus Cornelius Arvina being made dictator, and Marcus Fabius\r\nAmbustus master of the horse, a levy being held with more than usual\r\nrigour in consequence of their apprehension of a very serious war in\r\nSamnium, (for it was reported that some young men had been hired from\r\ntheir neighbours,) led forth a very strong army against the Samnites.\r\nAlthough in a hostile country, their camp was pitched in as careless a\r\nmanner as if the foe were at a great distance; when, suddenly, the\r\nlegions of the Samnites approached with so much boldness as to advance\r\ntheir rampart close to an out-post of the Romans. Night was now coming\r\non; that prevented their assaulting the works; but they did not conceal\r\ntheir intention of doing so next day, as soon as the light should\r\nappear. The dictator found that there would be a necessity for fighting\r\nsooner than he had expected, and lest the situation should be an\r\nobstruction to the bravery of the troops, he led away the legions in\r\nsilence, leaving a great number of fires the better to deceive the\r\nenemy. On account of the proximity of the camps, however, he could not\r\nescape their observation: their cavalry instantly pursued, and pressed\r\nclosely on his troops, in such a way as to refrain from attacking them\r\nuntil the day appeared. Their infantry did not even quit their camp\r\nbefore daylight. As soon as it was dawn, the cavalry venturing to attack\r\nthe enemy by harassing the Roman rear, and pressing them in places of\r\ndifficult passage, considerably delayed their march. Meanwhile their\r\ninfantry overtook the cavalry; and now the Samnites pursued close with\r\ntheir entire force. The dictator then, finding that he could no longer\r\ngo forward without great inconvenience, ordered the spot where he stood\r\nto be measured out for a camp. But it was impossible, while the enemy's\r\nhorse were spread about on every side, that palisades could be brought,\r\nand the work be begun: seeing it, therefore, impracticable, either to\r\nmarch forward or to settle himself there, he drew up his troops for\r\nbattle, removing the baggage out of the line. The enemy likewise formed\r\ntheir line opposite to his; fully equal both in spirit and in strength.\r\nTheir courage was chiefly improved from not knowing that the motive of\r\nthe Romans' retreat was the incommodiousness of the ground, so that they\r\nimagined themselves objects of terror, and supposed that they were\r\npursuing men who fled through fear. This kept the balance of the fight\r\nequal for a considerable time; though, of late, it had been unusual with\r\nthe Samnites to stand even the shout of a Roman army. Certain it is,\r\nthat the contest, on this day, continued so very doubtful from the third\r\nhour to the eighth, that neither was the shout repeated, after being\r\nraised at the first onset, nor the standards moved either forward or\r\nbackward; nor any ground lost on either side. They fought without taking\r\nbreath or looking behind them, every man in his post, and pushing\r\nagainst their opponents with their shields. The noise continuing equal,\r\nand the terror of the fight the same, seemed to denote, that the\r\ndecision would be effected either by fatigue or by the night. The men\r\nhad now exhausted their strength, the sword its power, and the leaders\r\ntheir skill; when, on a sudden, the Samnite cavalry, having learned from\r\na single troop which had advanced beyond the rest, that the baggage of\r\nthe Romans lay at a distance from their army, without any guard or\r\ndefence; through eagerness for booty, they attack it: of which the\r\ndictator being informed by a hasty messenger, said, \"Let them only\r\nencumber themselves with spoils.\" Afterwards came several, one after\r\nanother, crying out, that they were plundering and carrying off all the\r\neffects of the soldiers: he then called to him the master of the horse,\r\nand said, \"Do you see, Marcus Fabius, that the fight has been forsaken\r\nby the enemy's cavalry? They are entangled and encumbered with our\r\nbaggage. Attack them whilst scattered about, as is the case of every\r\nmultitude employed in plundering; you will find few mounted on\r\nhorseback, few with swords in their hands; and, while they are loading\r\ntheir horses with spoil, and unarmed, put them to the sword, and make it\r\nbloody spoil for them. I will take care of the legions, and the fight of\r\nthe infantry: yours be the honour which the horse shall acquire.\"\r\n\r\n39. The body of cavalry, in the most exact order possible, charging the\r\nenemy, who were straggling and embarrassed, filled every place with\r\nslaughter: for amid the packages which they hastily threw down, and\r\nwhich lay in the way of their feet, and of the affrighted horses, as\r\nthey endeavoured to escape, being now unable either to fight or fly,\r\nthey are slaughtered. Then Fabius, after he had almost entirely cut off\r\nthe enemy's horse, led round his squadrons in a small circuit, and\r\nattacked the infantry in the rear. The new shout, raised in that\r\nquarter, terrified the Samnites on the one hand; and when, on the other,\r\nthe dictator saw their troops in the van looking behind them, their\r\nbattalions in confusion, and their line wavering, he earnestly exhorted\r\nand animated his men, calling on the tribunes and chief centurions, by\r\nname, to join him in renewing the fight. Raising the shout anew, they\r\npressed forward, and as they advanced, perceived the enemy more and more\r\nconfused. The cavalry now could be seen by those in front, and\r\nCornelius, turning about to the several companies, made them understand,\r\nby raising his voice and hands, that he saw the standards and bucklers\r\nof his own horsemen. On hearing which, and at the same time seeing them,\r\nthey, at once, so far forgot the fatigue which they had endured through\r\nalmost the whole day, and even their wounds, that they rushed on against\r\nthe enemy with as much vigour and alacrity as if they were coming fresh\r\nout of camp on receiving the signal for battle. The Samnites could no\r\nlonger sustain the charge of horse and foot together; part of them,\r\nenclosed on both sides, were cut off; the rest were scattered and fled\r\ndifferent ways. The infantry slew those who were surrounded and made\r\nresistance; and the cavalry made great havoc of the fugitives, among\r\nwhom fell their general. This battle crushed, at length, the power of\r\nthe Samnites so effectually, that, in all their meetings, they said, \"it\r\nwas not at all to be wondered at, if in an impious war, commenced in\r\nviolation of a treaty, when the gods were, with justice, more incensed\r\nagainst them than men, they succeeded in none of their undertakings.\r\nThat war must be expiated and atoned for with a heavy penalty. The only\r\nalternative they had, was whether the penalty should be the guilty blood\r\nof a few, or the innocent blood of all.\" Some now ventured to name the\r\nauthors of the war; one name in particular, by the united voices of all,\r\nwas mentioned, that of Brutulus Papius; he was a man of power and noble\r\nbirth, and undoubtedly the violator of the late truce. The prætors being\r\ncompelled to take the opinion of the assembly concerning him, a decree\r\nwas made, \"that Brutulus Papius should be delivered into the hands of\r\nthe Romans; and that, together with him, all the spoil taken from the\r\nRomans, and the prisoners, should be sent to Rome, and that the\r\nrestitution demanded by the heralds, in conformity to treaty, should be\r\nmade, as was agreeable to justice and equity.\" In pursuance of this\r\ndetermination heralds were sent to Rome, and also the dead body of\r\nBrutulus; for, by a voluntary death, he avoided the punishment and\r\nignominy intended for him. It was thought proper that his goods also\r\nshould be delivered up along with the body. But none of all those things\r\nwere accepted, except the prisoners, and such articles of the spoil as\r\nwere recognised by the owners. The dictator obtained a triumph by a\r\ndecree of the senate.\r\n\r\n40. Some writers affirm, that this war was conducted by the consuls, and\r\nthat they triumphed over the Samnites; and also, that Fabius advanced\r\ninto Apulia, and carried off from thence abundance of spoil. But that\r\nAulus Cornelius was dictator that year is an undisputed fact. The\r\nquestion then is, whether he was appointed for the purpose of conducting\r\nthe war, or on occasion of the illness of Lucius Plautius, the prætor;\r\nin order that there might be a magistrate to give the signal for the\r\nstarting of the chariots at the Roman games. This latter is asserted of\r\nhim; and that after performing the business, which in truth reflected no\r\ngreat lustre on his office, he resigned the dictatorship. It is not\r\neasy to determine between either the facts or the writers, which of them\r\ndeserves the preference: I am inclined to think that history has been\r\nmuch corrupted by means of funeral panegyrics and false inscriptions on\r\nstatues; each family striving by false representations to appropriate to\r\nitself the fame of warlike exploits and public honours. From this cause,\r\ncertainly, both the actions of individuals and the public records of\r\nevents have been confused. Nor is there extant any writer, contemporary\r\nwith those events, on whose authority we can with certainty rely.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL. I.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN CHILDS AND SON, BUNGAY.",
