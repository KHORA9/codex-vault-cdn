venerable Fray\r\nAntonio Agapida, it is rather a superstructure reared upon the fragments\r\nwhich remain of his work. It may be asked, Who is this same Agapida, who\r\nis cited with such deference, yet whose name is not to be found in any\r\nof the catalogues of Spanish authors? The question is hard to answer. He\r\nappears to have been one of the many indefatigable authors of Spain who\r\nhave filled the libraries of convents and cathedrals with their\r\ntomes, without ever dreaming of bringing their labors to the press. He\r\nevidently was deeply and accurately informed of the particulars of the\r\nwars between his countrymen and the Moors, a tract of history but too\r\nmuch overgrown with the weeds of fable. His glowing zeal, also, in the\r\ncause of the Catholic faith entitles him to be held up as a model of the\r\ngood old orthodox chroniclers, who recorded with such pious exultation\r\nthe united triumphs of the cross and the sword. It is deeply to be\r\nregretted, therefore, that his manuscripts, deposited in the libraries\r\nof various convents, have been dispersed during the late convulsions\r\nin Spain, so that nothing is now to be met of them but disjointed\r\nfragments. These, however, are too precious to be suffered to fall into\r\noblivion, as they contain many curious facts not to be found in any\r\nother historian. In the following work, therefore, the manuscript of the\r\nworthy Fray Antonio will be adopted wherever it exists entire, but will\r\nbe filled up, extended, illustrated, and corroborated by citations\r\nfrom various authors, both Spanish and Arabian, who have treated of the\r\nsubject. Those who may wish to know how far the work is indebted to the\r\nChronicle of Fray Antonio Agapida may readily satisfy their curiosity\r\nby referring to his manuscript fragments, carefully preserved in the\r\nLibrary of the Escurial.\r\n\r\nBefore entering upon the history it may be as well to notice the\r\nopinions of certain of the most learned and devout historiographers of\r\nformer times relative to this war.\r\n\r\nMarinus Siculus, historian to Charles V., pronounces it a war to avenge\r\nancient injuries received by the Christians from the Moors, to recover\r\nthe kingdom of Granada, and to extend the name and honor of the\r\nChristian religion.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Lucio Marino Siculo, Cosas Memorabiles de Espana, lib. 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstevan de Garibay, one of the most distinguished Spanish historians,\r\nregards the war as a special act of divine clemency toward the Moors, to\r\nthe end that those barbarians and infidels, who had dragged out so many\r\ncenturies under the diabolical oppression of the absurd sect of Mahomet,\r\nshould at length be reduced to the Christian faith.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Garibay, Compend. Hist. Espana, lib. 18, c. 22.\r\n\r\n\r\nPadre Mariana, also a venerable Jesuit and the most renowned historian\r\nof Spain, considers the past domination of the Moors a scourge inflicted\r\non the Spanish nation for its iniquities, but the conquest of Granada\r\nthe reward of Heaven for its great act of propitiation in establishing\r\nthe glorious tribunal of the Inquisition! No sooner (says the worthy\r\nfather) was this holy office opened in Spain than there shone forth a\r\nresplendent light. Then it was that, through divine favor, the nation\r\nincreased in power, and became competent to overthrow and trample down\r\nthe Moorish domination.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Mariana, Hist. Espana, lib. 25, c. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving thus cited high and venerable authority for considering this war\r\nin the light of one of those pious enterprises denominated crusades, we\r\ntrust we have said enough to engage the Christian reader to follow us\r\ninto the field and stand by us to the very issue of the encounter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE TO THE REVISED EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foregoing introduction, prefixed to the former editions of this\r\nwork, has been somewhat of a detriment to it. Fray Antonio Agapida was\r\nfound to be an imaginary personage, and this threw a doubt over the\r\ncredibility of his Chronicle, which was increased by a vein of irony\r\nindulged here and there, and by the occasional heightening of some of\r\nthe incidents and the romantic coloring of some of the scenes. A word or\r\ntwo explanatory may therefore be of service.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Many of the observations in this note have already appeared in\r\nan explanatory article which at Mr. Murray’s request, the author\r\nfurnished to the London Quarterly Review.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea of the work was suggested while I was occupied at Madrid in\r\nwriting the Life of Columbus. In searching for traces of his early life\r\nI was led among the scenes of the war of Granada, he having followed the\r\nSpanish sovereigns in some of their campaigns, and been present at the\r\nsurrender of the Moorish capital. I actually wove some of these scenes\r\ninto the biography, but found they occupied an undue space, and stood\r\nout in romantic relief not in unison with the general course of the\r\nnarrative. My mind, however, had become so excited by the stirring\r\nevents and romantic achievements of this war that I could not return\r\nwith composure to the sober biography I had in hand. The idea then\r\noccurred, as a means of allaying the excitement, to throw off a rough\r\ndraught of the history of this war, to be revised and completed at\r\nfuture leisure. It appeared to me that its true course and character\r\nhad never been fully illustrated. The world had received a strangely\r\nperverted idea of it through Florian’s romance of “Gonsalvo of Cordova,”\r\n or through the legend, equally fabulous, entitled “The Civil Wars of\r\nGranada,” by Ginez Perez de la Hita, the pretended work of an Arabian\r\ncontemporary, but in reality a Spanish fabrication. It had been woven\r\nover with love-tales and scenes of sentimental gallantry totally\r\nopposite to its real character; for it was, in truth, one of the\r\nsternest of those iron conflicts sanctified by the title of “holy wars.”\r\n In fact, the genuine nature of the war placed it far above the need\r\nof any amatory embellishments. It possessed sufficient interest in the\r\nstriking contrast presented by the combatants of Oriental and European\r\ncreeds, costumes, and manners, and in the hardy and harebrained\r\nenterprises, the romantic adventures, the picturesque forays through\r\nmountain regions, the daring assaults and surprisals of cliff-built\r\ncastles and cragged fortresses, which succeeded each other with a\r\nvariety and brilliancy beyond the scope of mere invention.\r\n\r\nThe time of the contest also contributed to heighten the interest.\r\nIt was not long after the invention of gunpowder, when firearms and\r\nartillery mingled the flash and smoke and thunder of modern warfare with\r\nthe steely splendor of ancient chivalry, and gave an awful magnificence\r\nand terrible sublimity to battle, and when the old Moorish towers and\r\ncastles, that for ages had frowned defiance to the battering-rams and\r\ncatapults of classic tactics, were toppled down by the lombards of\r\nthe Spanish engineers. It was one of the cases in which history rises\r\nsuperior to fiction.\r\n\r\nThe more I thought about the subject, the more I was tempted to\r\nundertake it, and the facilities at hand at length determined me. In the\r\nlibraries of Madrid and in the private library of the American consul,\r\nMr. Rich, I had access to various chronicles and other works, both\r\nprinted and in manuscript, written at the time by eyewitnesses, and\r\nin some instances by persons who had actually mingled in the scenes\r\nrecorded and gave descriptions of them from different points of view and\r\nwith different details. These works were often diffuse and tedious,\r\nand occasionally discolored by the bigotry, superstition, and fierce\r\nintolerance of the age; but their pages were illumined at times with\r\nscenes of high emprise, of romantic generosity, and heroic valor, which\r\nflashed upon the reader with additional splendor from the surrounding\r\ndarkness. I collated these various works, some of which have never\r\nappeared in print, drew from each facts relative to the different\r\nenterprises, arranged them in as clear and lucid order as I could\r\ncommand, and endeavored to give them somewhat of a graphic effect by\r\nconnecting them with the manners and customs of the age in which they\r\noccurred. The rough draught being completed, I laid the manuscript aside\r\nand proceeded with the Life of Columbus. After this was finished and\r\nsent to the press I made a tour in Andalusia, visited the ruins of the\r\nMoorish towns, fortresses, and castles, and the wild mountain-passes and\r\ndefiles which had been the scenes of the most remarkable events of the\r\nwar, and passed some time in the ancient palace of the Alhambra, the\r\nonce favorite abode of the Moorish monarchs. Everywhere I took notes,\r\nfrom the most advantageous points of view, of whatever could serve to\r\ngive local verity and graphic effect to the scenes described. Having\r\ntaken up my abode for a time at Seville, I then resumed my manuscript\r\nand rewrote it, benefited by my travelling notes and the fresh and vivid\r\nimpressions of my recent tour. In constructing my chronicle I adopted\r\nthe fiction of a Spanish monk as the chronicler. Fray Antonio Agapida\r\nwas intended as a personification of the monkish zealots who hovered\r\nabout the sovereigns in their campaigns, marring the chivalry of the\r\ncamp by the bigotry of the cloister, and chronicling in rapturous\r\nstrains every act of intolerance toward the Moors. In fact, scarce a\r\nsally of the pretended friar when he bursts forth in rapturous eulogy of\r\nsome great stroke of selfish policy on the part of Ferdinand, or exults\r\nover some overwhelming disaster of the gallant and devoted Moslems,\r\nbut is taken almost word for word from one or other of the orthodox\r\nchroniclers of Spain.\r\n\r\nThe ironical vein also was provoked by the mixture of kingcraft and\r\npriestcraft discernible throughout this great enterprise, and the\r\nmistaken zeal and self-delusion of many of its most gallant and generous\r\nchampions. The romantic coloring seemed to belong to the nature of the\r\nsubject, and was in harmony with what I had seen in my tour through the\r\npoetical and romantic regions in which the events had taken place. With\r\nall these deductions the work, in all its essential points, was faithful\r\nto historical fact and built upon substantial documents. It was a great\r\nsatisfaction to me, therefore, after the doubts that had been expressed\r\nof the authenticity of my chronicle, to find it repeatedly and largely\r\nused by Don Miguel Lafuente Alcantara of Granada in his recent\r\nlearned and elaborate history of his native city, he having had ample\r\nopportunity, in his varied and indefatigable researches, of judging how\r\nfar it accorded with documentary authority.\r\n\r\nI have still more satisfaction in citing the following testimonial of\r\nMr. Prescott, whose researches for his admirable history of Ferdinand\r\nand Isabella took him over the same ground I had trodden. His\r\ntestimonial is written in the liberal and courteous spirit\r\ncharacteristic of him, but with a degree of eulogium which would make me\r\nshrink from quoting it did I not feel the importance of his voucher for\r\nthe substantial accuracy of my work:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Irving’s late publication, the ‘Chronicle of the Conquest\r\nof Granada,’ has superseded all further necessity for poetry and,\r\nunfortunately for me, for history. He has fully availed himself of all\r\nthe picturesque and animating movement of this romantic era, and the\r\nreader who will take the trouble to compare his chronicle with the\r\npresent more prosaic and literal narrative will see how little he\r\nhas been seduced from historic accuracy by the poetical aspect of his\r\nsubject. The fictitious and romantic dress of his work has enabled him\r\nto make it the medium of reflecting more vividly the floating opinions\r\nand chimerical fancies of the age, while he has illuminated the picture\r\nwith the dramatic brilliancy of coloring denied to sober history.” *\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Prescott’s Ferdinand and Isabella, vol. ii. c. 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the present edition I have endeavored to render the work more worthy\r\nof the generous encomium of Mr. Prescott. Though I still retain the\r\nfiction of the monkish author Agapida, I have brought my narrative more\r\nstrictly within historical bounds, have corrected and enriched it in\r\nvarious parts with facts recently brought to light by the researches\r\nof Alcantara and others, and have sought to render it a faithful and\r\ncharacteristic picture of the romantic portion of history to which it\r\nrelates.\r\n\r\nW. I.\r\n\r\nSunnyside, 1850.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CHRONICLE OF THE CONQUEST OF GRANADA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nOF THE KINGDOM OF GRANADA, AND THE TRIBUTE WHICH IT PAID TO THE\r\nCASTILIAN CROWN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of those bloody and disastrous wars which have caused the\r\ndownfall of mighty empires (observes Fray Antonio Agapida) has ever been\r\nconsidered a study highly delectable and full of precious edification.\r\nWhat, then, must be the history of a pious crusade waged by the most\r\nCatholic of sovereigns to rescue from the power of the infidels one of\r\nthe most beautiful but benighted regions of the globe? Listen, then,\r\nwhile from the solitude of my cell I relate the events of the conquest\r\nof Granada, where Christian knight and turbaned infidel disputed, inch\r\nby inch, the fair land of Andalusia, until the Crescent, that symbol of\r\nheathenish abomination, was cast down, and the blessed Cross, the tree\r\nof our redemption, erected in its stead.\r\n\r\nNearly eight hundred years were past and gone since the Arabian invaders\r\nhad sealed the perdition of Spain by the defeat of Don Roderick, the\r\nlast of her Gothic kings. Since that disastrous event one portion after\r\nanother of the Peninsula had been gradually recovered by the Christian\r\nprinces, until the single but powerful and warlike territory of Granada\r\nalone remained under the domination of the Moors.\r\n\r\nThis renowned kingdom, situated in the southern part of Spain and washed\r\non one side by the Mediterranean Sea, was traversed in every direction\r\nby sierras or chains of lofty and rugged mountains, naked, rocky, and\r\nprecipitous, rendering it almost impregnable, but locking up within\r\ntheir sterile embraces deep, rich, and verdant valleys of prodigal\r\nfertility.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the kingdom lay its capital, the beautiful city of\r\nGranada, sheltered, as it were, in the lap of the Sierra Nevada, or\r\nSnowy Mountains. Its houses, seventy thousand in number, covered two\r\nlofty hills with their declivities and a deep valley between them,\r\nthrough which flowed the Darro. The streets were narrow, as is usual in\r\nMoorish and Arab cities, but there were occasionally small squares and\r\nopen places. The houses had gardens and interior courts, set out with\r\norange, citron, and pomegranate trees and refreshed by fountains, so\r\nthat as the edifices ranged above each other up the sides of the hills,\r\nthey presented a delightful appearance of mingled grove and city. One of\r\nthe hills was surmounted by the Alcazaba, a strong fortress commanding\r\nall that part of the city; the other by the Alhambra, a royal palace and\r\nwarrior castle, capable of containing within its alcazar and towers\r\na garrison of forty thousand men, but possessing also its harem, the\r\nvoluptuous abode of the Moorish monarchs, laid out with courts and\r\ngardens, fountains and baths, and stately halls decorated in the most\r\ncostly style of Oriental luxury. According to Moorish tradition, the\r\nking who built this mighty and magnificent pile was skilled in the\r\noccult sciences, and furnished himself with the necessary funds by means\r\nof alchemy.* Such was its lavish splendor that even at the present day\r\nthe stranger, wandering through its silent courts and deserted halls,\r\ngazes with astonishment at gilded ceilings and fretted domes, the\r\nbrilliancy and beauty of which have survived the vicissitudes of war and\r\nthe silent dilapidation of ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Zurita, lib. 20, c. 42.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe city was surrounded by high walls, three leagues in circuit,\r\nfurnished with twelve gates and a thousand and thirty towers. Its\r\nelevation above the sea and the neighborhood of the Sierra Nevada\r\ncrowned with perpetual snows tempered the fervid rays of summer, so that\r\nwhile other cities were panting with the sultry and stifling heat of the\r\ndog-days, the most salubrious breezes played through the marble halls of\r\nGranada.\r\n\r\nThe glory of the city, however, was its Vega or plain, which spread\r\nout to a circumference of thirty-seven leagues, surrounded by lofty\r\nmountains, and was proudly compared to the famous plain of Damascus. It\r\nwas a vast garden of delight, refreshed by numerous fountains and by the\r\nsilver windings of the Xenil. The labor and ingenuity of the Moors had\r\ndiverted the waters of this river into thousands of rills and streams,\r\nand diffused them over the whole surface of the plain. Indeed, they had\r\nwrought up this happy region to a degree of wonderful prosperity, and\r\ntook a pride in decorating it as if it had been a favorite mistress. The\r\nhills were clothed with orchards and vineyards, the valleys embroidered\r\nwith gardens, and the wide plains covered with waving grain. Here were\r\nseen in profusion the orange, the citron, the fig, and the pomegranate,\r\nwith great plantations of mulberry trees, from which was produced the\r\nfinest silk. The vine clambered from tree to tree, the grapes hung in\r\nrich clusters about the peasant’s cottage, and the groves were rejoiced\r\nby the perpetual song of the nightingale. In a word, so beautiful was\r\nthe earth, so pure the air, and so serene the sky of this delicious\r\nregion that the Moors imagined the paradise of their Prophet to be\r\nsituated in that part of the heaven which overhung the kingdom of\r\nGranada.\r\n\r\nWithin this favored realm, so prodigally endowed and strongly fortified\r\nby nature, the Moslem wealth, valor, and intelligence, which had once\r\nshed such a lustre over Spain, had gradually retired, and here they made\r\ntheir final stand. Granada had risen to splendor on the ruin of other\r\nMoslem kingdoms, but in so doing had become the sole object of Christian\r\nhostility, and had to maintain its very existence by the sword. The\r\nMoorish capital accordingly presented a singular scene of Asiatic luxury\r\nand refinement, mingled with the glitter and the din of arms. Letters\r\nwere still cultivated, philosophy and poetry had their schools and\r\ndisciples, and the language spoken was said to be the most elegant\r\nArabic. A passion for dress and ornament pervaded all ranks. That of\r\nthe princesses and ladies of high rank, says Al Kattib, one of their\r\nown writers, was carried to a height of luxury and magnificence that\r\nbordered on delirium. They wore girdles and bracelets and anklets of\r\ngold and silver, wrought with exquisite art and delicacy and studded\r\nwith jacinths, chrysolites, emeralds, and other precious stones. They\r\nwere fond of braiding and decorating their beautiful long tresses or\r\nconfining them in knots sparkling with jewels. They were finely formed,\r\nexcessively fair, graceful in their manners, and fascinating in their\r\nconversation; when they smiled, says Al Kattib, they displayed teeth of\r\ndazzling whiteness, and their breath was as the perfume of flowers.\r\n\r\nThe Moorish cavaliers, when not in armor, delighted in dressing\r\nthemselves in Persian style, in garments of wool, of silk, or cotton of\r\nthe finest texture, beautifully wrought with stripes of various colors.\r\nIn winter they wore, as an outer garment, the African cloak or Tunisian\r\nalbornoz, but in the heat of summer they arrayed themselves in linen\r\nof spotless whiteness. The same luxury prevailed in their military\r\nequipments. Their armor was inlaid and chased with gold and silver. The\r\nsheaths of their scimetars were richly labored and enamelled, the blades\r\nwere of Damascus bearing texts from the Koran or martial and amorous\r\nmottoes; the belts were of golden filigree studded with gems; their\r\nponiards of Fez were wrought in the arabesque fashion; their lances bore\r\ngay bandaroles; their horses were sumptuously caparisoned with housings\r\nof green and crimson velvet, wrought with silk and enamelled with\r\ngold and silver. All this warlike luxury of the youthful chivalry was\r\nencouraged by the Moorish kings, who ordained that no tax should be\r\nimposed on the gold and silver employed in these embellishments; and the\r\nsame exception was extended to the bracelets and other ornaments worn\r\nby the fair dames of Granada.\r\n\r\nOf the chivalrous gallantry which prevailed between the sexes in this\r\nromantic period of Moorish history we have traces in the thousand\r\nballads which have come down to our day, and which have given a tone\r\nand coloring to Spanish amatory literature and to everything in Spain\r\nconnected with the tender passion.\r\n\r\nWar was the normal state of Granada and its inhabitants; the common\r\npeople were subject at any moment to be summoned to the field, and all\r\nthe upper class was a brilliant chivalry. The Christian princes, so\r\nsuccessful in regaining the rest of the Peninsula, found their triumphs\r\nchecked at the mountain-boundaries of this kingdom. Every peak had its\r\natalaya, or watch-tower, ready to make its fire by night or to send\r\nup its column of smoke by day, a signal of invasion at which the whole\r\ncountry was on the alert. To penetrate the defiles of this perilous\r\ncountry, to surprise a frontier fortress, or to make a foray into the\r\nVega and a hasty ravage within sight of the very capital were among the\r\nmost favorite and daring exploits of the Castilian chivalry. But they\r\nnever pretended to hold the region thus ravaged; it was sack, burn,\r\nplunder, and away; and these desolating inroads were retaliated in\r\nkind by the Moorish cavaliers, whose greatest delight was a “tala,”\r\n or predatory incursion, into the Christian territories beyond the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nA partisan warfare of this kind had long existed between Granada and its\r\nmost formidable antagonists, the kingdoms of Castile and Leon. It was\r\none which called out the keen yet generous rivalry of Christian and\r\nMoslem cavaliers, and gave rise to individual acts of chivalrous\r\ngallantry and daring prowess; but it was one which was gradually\r\nexhausting the resources and sapping the strength of Granada. One of the\r\nlatest of its kings, therefore, Aben Ismael by name, disheartened by a\r\nforay which had laid waste the Vega, and conscious that the balance of\r\nwarfare was against his kingdom, made a truce in 1457 with Henry IV.,\r\nking of Castile and Leon, stipulating to pay him an annual tribute of\r\ntwelve thousand doblas or pistoles of gold, and to liberate annually six\r\nhundred Christian captives, or in default of captives to give an\r\nequal number of Moors as hostages,--all to be delivered at the city of\r\nCordova.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Garibay, Compend., 1.17, c. 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe truce, however, was of a partial nature, with singular reservations.\r\nIt did not include the Moorish frontier toward Jaen, which was to\r\nremain open for the warlike enterprises of either nation; neither did it\r\nprohibit sudden attacks upon towns and castles, provided they were mere\r\nforays, conducted furtively, without sound of trumpet or display of\r\nbanners or pitching of camps or regular investment, and that they did\r\nnot last above three days.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Zurita, Anales de Aragon, 1. 20, c. 42; Mariana, Hist. de Espana 1.\r\n25, c. 1; Bleda, Coron. de los Moros, l. 5, c. 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nAben Ismael was faithful in observing the conditions of the truce, but\r\nthey were regarded with impatience by his eldest son, Muley Abul Hassan,\r\na prince of a fiery and belligerent spirit, and fond of casing himself\r\nin armor and mounting his war-horse. He had been present at Cordova at\r\none of the payments of tribute, and had witnessed the scoffs and\r\ntaunts of the Christians, and his blood boiled whenever he recalled the\r\nhumiliating scene. When he came to the throne in 1465, on the death of\r\nhis father, he ceased the payment of the tribute altogether, and it was\r\nsufficient to put him into a tempest of rage only to mention it.\r\n\r\n“He was a fierce and warlike infidel,” says the pious Fray Antonio\r\nAgapida; “his bitterness against the holy Christian faith had been\r\nsignalized in battle during the lifetime of his father, and the same\r\ndiabolical spirit of hostility was apparent in his ceasing to pay this\r\nmost righteous tribute.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nOF THE EMBASSY OF DON JUAN DE VERA TO DEMAND ARREARS OF TRIBUTE FROM THE\r\nMOORISH MONARCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe flagrant want of faith of Muley Abul Hassan in fulfilling treaty\r\nstipulations passed unresented during the residue of the reign of\r\nHenry the Impotent, and the truce was tacitly continued without the\r\nenforcement of tribute during the first three years of the reign of his\r\nsuccessors, Ferdinand and Isabella of glorious and happy memory, who\r\nwere too much engrossed by civil commotions in their own dominions, and\r\nby a war of succession waged with them by the king of Portugal, to risk\r\nan additional conflict with the Moorish sovereign. When, however, at the\r\nexpiration of the term of truce, Muley Abul Hassan sought a renewal of\r\nit, the pride and piety of the Castilian sovereigns were awakened to\r\nthe flagrant defalcation of the infidel king, and they felt themselves\r\ncalled upon, by their dignity as monarchs and their religious\r\nobligations as champions of the faith, to make a formal demand for the\r\npayment of arrearages.\r\n\r\nIn the year of grace 1478, therefore, Don Juan de Vera, a zealous and\r\ndevout knight, full of ardor for the faith and loyalty to the Crown,\r\nwas sent as ambassador for the purpose. He was armed at all points,\r\ngallantly mounted, and followed by a moderate but well-appointed\r\nretinue: in this way he crossed the Moorish frontier, and passed slowly\r\nthrough the country, looking round him with the eyes of a practised\r\nwarrior and carefully noting its military points and capabilities. He\r\nsaw that the Moor was well prepared for possible hostilities. Every town\r\nwas strongly fortified. The Vega was studded with towers of refuge for\r\nthe peasantry: every pass of the mountain had its castle of defence,\r\nevery lofty height its watch-tower. As the Christian cavaliers passed\r\nunder the walls of the fortresses, lances and scimetars flashed from\r\ntheir battlements, and the Moorish sentinels darted from their dark\r\neyes glances of hatred and defiance. It was evident that a war with\r\nthis kingdom must be a war of posts, full of doughty peril and valiant\r\nenterprise, where every step must be gained by toil and bloodshed,\r\nand maintained with the utmost difficulty. The warrior spirit of\r\nthe cavaliers kindled at the thoughts, and they were impatient for\r\nhostilities; “not,” says Antonio Agapida, “from any thirst for rapine\r\nand revenge, but from that pure and holy indignation which every Spanish\r\nknight entertained at beholding this beautiful dominion of his ancestors\r\ndefiled by the footsteps of infidel usurpers. It was impossible,” he\r\nadds, “to contemplate this delicious country, and not long to see it\r\nrestored to the dominion of the true faith and the sway of the Christian\r\nmonarchs.”\r\n\r\nArrived at the gates of Granada, Don Juan de Vera and his companions\r\nsaw the same vigilant preparations on the part of the Moorish king. His\r\nwalls and towers were of vast strength, in complete repair, and mounted\r\nwith lombards and other heavy ordnance. His magazines were well stored\r\nwith the munitions of war; he had a mighty host of foot-soldiers,\r\ntogether with squadrons of cavalry, ready to scour the country and carry\r\non either defensive or predatory warfare. The Christian warriors noted\r\nthese things without dismay; their hearts rather glowed with emulation\r\nat the thoughts of encountering so worthy a foe. As they slowly pranced\r\nthrough the streets of Granada they looked round with eagerness on\r\nthe stately palaces and sumptuous mosques, on its alcayceria or bazar,\r\ncrowded with silks and cloth of silver and gold, with jewels and\r\nprecious stones, and other rich merchandise, the luxuries of every\r\nclime; and they longed for the time when all this wealth should be the\r\nspoil of the soldiers of the faith, and when each tramp of their steeds\r\nmight be fetlock deep in the blood and carnage of the infidels.\r\n\r\nThe Moorish inhabitants looked jealously at this small but proud array\r\nof Spanish chivalry, as it paraded, with that stateliness possessed only\r\nby Spanish cavaliers, through the renowned gate of Elvira. They were\r\nstruck with the stern and lofty demeanor of Don Juan de Vera and his\r\nsinewy frame, which showed him formed for hardy deeds of arms, and they\r\nsupposed he had come in search of distinction by defying the Moorish\r\nknights in open tourney or in the famous tilt with reeds for which they\r\nwere so renowned, for it was still the custom of the knights of either\r\nnation to mingle in these courteous and chivalrous contests during the\r\nintervals of war. When they learnt, however, that he was come to demand\r\nthe tribute so abhorrent to the ears of the fiery monarch, they observed\r\nthat it well required a warrior of his apparent nerve to execute such an\r\nembassy.\r\n\r\nMuley Abul Hassan received the cavalier in state, seated on a\r\nmagnificent divan and surrounded by the officers of his court, in\r\nthe Hall of Ambassadors, one of the most sumptuous apartments of the\r\nAlhambra. When De Vera had delivered his message, a haughty and bitter\r\nsmile curled the lip of the fierce monarch. “Tell your sovereigns,” said\r\nhe, “that the kings of Granada, who used to pay tribute in money to the\r\nCastilian crown, are dead. Our mint at present coins nothing but blades\r\nof scimetars and heads of lances.” *\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Garibay, 1. 40, c. 29; Conde, Hist. Arab., p. 4, c. 34.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe defiance couched in this proud reply was heard with secret\r\nsatisfaction by Don Juan de Vera, for he was a bold soldier and a devout\r\nhater of the infidels, and he saw iron war in the words of the Moorish\r\nmonarch. Being master, however, of all points of etiquette, he retained\r\nan inflexible demeanor, and retired from the apartment with stately and\r\nceremonious gravity. His treatment was suited to his rank and dignity:\r\na magnificent apartment in the Alhambra was assigned to him, and before\r\nhis departure a scimetar was sent to him by the king, the blade of the\r\nfinest Damascus steel, the hilt of agate enriched with precious stones,\r\nand the guard of gold. De Vera drew it, and smiled grimly as he noticed\r\nthe admirable temper of the blade. “His Majesty has given me a trenchant\r\nweapon,” said he: “I trust a time will come when I may show him that\r\nI know how to use his royal present.” The reply was considered a\r\ncompliment, of course: the bystanders little knew the bitter hostility\r\nthat lay couched beneath.\r\n\r\nOn his return to Cordova, Don Juan de Vera delivered the reply of the\r\nMoor, but at the same time reported the state of his territories. These\r\nhad been strengthened and augmented during the weak reign of Henry\r\nIV. and the recent troubles of Castile. Many cities and strong places\r\ncontiguous to Granada, but heretofore conquered by the Christians, had\r\nrenewed their allegiance to Muley Abul Hassan, so that his kingdom\r\nnow contained fourteen cities, ninety-seven fortified places, besides\r\nnumerous unwalled towns and villages defended by formidable castles,\r\nwhile Granada towered in the centre as the citadel.\r\n\r\nThe wary Ferdinand, as he listened to the military report of Don Juan\r\nde Vera, saw that the present was no time for hostilities with a warrior\r\nkingdom so bristled over with means of defence. The internal discords\r\nof Castile still continued, as did the war with Portugal: under these\r\ncircumstances he forbore to insist upon the payment of tribute, and\r\ntacitly permitted the truce to continue; but the defiance contained\r\nin the reply of Muley Abul Hassan remained rankling in his bosom as a\r\nfuture ground of war; and De Vera’s description of Granada as the centre\r\nof a system of strongholds and rock-built castles suggested to him his\r\nplan of conquest--by taking town after town and fortress after fortress,\r\nand gradually plucking away all the supports before he attempted the\r\ncapital. He expressed his resolution in a memorable pun or play upon\r\nthe name of Granada, which signifies a pomegranate. “I will pick out\r\nthe seeds of this pomegranate one by one,” said the cool and crafty\r\nFerdinand.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--In the first edition of this work the author recounted a\r\ncharacteristic adventure of the stout Juan de Vera as happening on\r\nthe occasion of this embassy; a further consultation of historical\r\nauthorities has induced him to transfer it to a second embassy of De\r\nVera’s, which the reader will find related in a subsequent chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC FEUDS IN THE ALHAMBRA--RIVAL SULTANAS--PREDICTIONS CONCERNING\r\nBOABDIL, THE HEIR TO THE THRONE--HOW FERDINAND MEDITATES WAR AGAINST\r\nGRANADA, AND HOW HE IS ANTICIPATED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough Muley Abul Hassan was at peace in his external relations, a civil\r\nwar raged in his harem, which it is proper to notice, as it had a fatal\r\neffect upon the fortunes of the kingdom. Though cruel by nature, he was\r\nuxorious and somewhat prone to be managed by his wives. Early in life\r\nhe had married his kinswoman, Ayxa (or Ayesha), daughter of his\r\ngreat-uncle, the sultan Mohammed VII., surnamed El Hayzari, or the\r\nLeft-handed. She was a woman of almost masculine spirit and energy, and\r\nof such immaculate and inaccessible virtue that she was generally called\r\nLa Horra, or the Chaste. By her he had a son, Abu Abdallah, or, as he is\r\ncommonly named by historians, Boabdil. The court astrologers, according\r\nto custom, cast the horoscope of the infant, but were seized with\r\nfear and trembling as they regarded it. “Allah Akbar! God is great!”\r\n exclaimed they; “he alone controls the fate of empires. It is written in\r\nthe book of fate that this child will one day sit upon the throne, but\r\nthat the downfall of the kingdom will be accomplished during his reign.”\r\n From that time the prince had been regarded with aversion by his father,\r\nand the prediction which hung over him and the persecutions to which\r\nhe became subjected procured him the surname of El Zogoybi, or\r\nthe Unfortunate. He grew up, however, under the protection of his\r\nvaliant-hearted mother, who by the energy of her character long\r\nmaintained an undisputed sway in the harem, until, as her youth passed\r\naway and her beauty declined, a formidable rival arose.\r\n\r\nIn one of the forays of the Moorish chivalry into the Christian\r\nterritories they had surprised a frontier fortress commanded by Sancho\r\nXimenes de Solis, a noble and valiant cavalier, who fell in bravely\r\ndefending it. Among the captives was his daughter Isabella, then almost\r\nin her infancy, who was brought to Granada, delicately raised, and\r\neducated in the Moslem faith.* Her Moorish captors gave her the name of\r\nFatima, but as she grew up her surpassing beauty gained her the surname\r\nof Zoraya, or the Morning Star, by which she has become known in\r\nhistory. Her charms at length attracted the notice of Muley Abul Hassan,\r\nand she soon became a member of his harem. Some have spoken of her as\r\na Christian slave whom he had made his concubine; but others, with more\r\ntruth, represent her as one of his wives, and ultimately his favorite\r\nsultana; and indeed it was often the case that female captives of rank\r\nand beauty, when converted to the faith of Islam, became united to the\r\nproudest and loftiest of their captors.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Cronica del Gran Cardinal, cap. 71.\r\n\r\n\r\nZoraya soon acquired complete ascendancy over the mind of Muley Abul\r\nHassan. She was as ambitious as she was beautiful, and, having become\r\nthe mother of two sons, looked forward to the possibility of one of them\r\nsitting on the throne of Granada. These ambitious views were encouraged,\r\nif not suggested, by a faction which gathered round her inspired by\r\nkindred sympathies. The king’s vizier, Abul Cacim Vanegas, who had great\r\ninfluence over him, was, like Zoraya, of Christian descent, being of\r\nthe noble house of Luque. His father, one of the Vanegas of Cordova, had\r\nbeen captured in infancy and brought up as a Moslem.* From him sprang\r\nthe vizier, Abul Cacim Vanegas, and his brother, Reduan Vanegas,\r\nlikewise high in rank in the court of Muley Abul Hassan, and they had\r\nabout them numerous and powerful connections, all basking in court\r\nfavor. Though Moslems in faith, they were all drawn to Zoraya by the\r\ntie of foreign and Christian descent, and sought to elevate her and her\r\nchildren to the disparagement of Ayxa la Horra and her son Boabdil. The\r\nlatter, on the other hand, were supported by the noble and once-potent\r\nfamily of the Abencerrages and by Aben Comixa, alcayde of the Alhambra;\r\nand between these two factions, headed by rival sultanas, the harem\r\nof Muley Abul Hassan became the scene of inveterate jealousies and\r\nintrigues, which in time, as will be shown, led to popular commotions\r\nand civil wars.**\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Cura de los Palacios, Hist. de los Reyes Catol., cap. 56.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * *It is to be noted that several historians have erroneously\r\nrepresented Zoraya as the mother of Boabdil, instead of Ayxa la Horra,\r\nand the Abencerrages as the opponents of Boabdil, instead of his\r\nstrenuous adherents. The statement in the text is according to the most\r\nreliable authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile these female feuds were threatening Muley Abul Hassan with trouble\r\nand disaster at home, his evil genius prompted him to an enterprise\r\nwhich involved him in tenfold danger from abroad. The reader has already\r\nbeen apprised of a singular clause in the truce existing between the\r\nChristians and the Moors, permitting hasty dashes into each other’s\r\nterritories and assaults of towns and fortresses, provided they were\r\ncarried on as mere forays and without the parade of regular warfare. A\r\nlong time had elapsed, however, without any incursion of the kind on\r\nthe part of the Moors, and the Christian towns on the frontiers had, in\r\nconsequence, fallen into a state of the most negligent security. In an\r\nunlucky moment Muley Abul Hassan was tempted to one of these forays by\r\nlearning that the fortress of Zahara, on the frontier between Ronda and\r\nMedina Sidonia, was but feebly garrisoned and scantily supplied, and\r\nthat its alcayde was careless of his charge. This important post was\r\nbuilt on the crest of a rocky mountain, with a strong castle perched\r\nabove it upon a cliff, so high that it was said to be above the flight\r\nof birds or drift of clouds. The streets and many of the houses were\r\nmere excavations wrought out of the living rock. The town had but one\r\ngate, opening to the west and defended by towers and bulwarks. The only\r\nascent to this cragged fortress was by roads cut in the rock, so rugged\r\nin many places as to resemble broken stairs. In a word, the impregnable\r\nsecurity of Zahara had become so proverbial throughout Spain that a\r\nwoman of forbidding and inaccessible virtue was called a Zaharena. But\r\nthe strongest fortress and sternest virtue have weak points, and require\r\nunremitting vigilance to guard them: let warrior and dame take warning\r\nfrom the fate of Zahara.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nEXPEDITION OF MULEY ABUL HASSAN AGAINST THE FORTRESS OF ZAHARA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord one thousand four hundred and eighty-one, and\r\nbut a night or two after the festival of the most blessed Nativity, the\r\ninhabitants of Zahara were sunk in profound sleep the very sentinel had\r\ndeserted his post, and sought shelter from a tempest which had raged for\r\nthree nights in succession, for it appeared but little probable that an\r\nenemy would be abroad during such an uproar of the elements. But evil\r\nspirits work best during a storm. In the midst of the night an uproar\r\nrose within the walls of Zahara more awful than the raging of the\r\nstorm. A fearful alarm-cry, “The Moor! the Moor!” resounded through the\r\nstreets, mingled with the clash of arms, the shriek of anguish, and the\r\nshout of victory. Muley Abul Hassan, at the head of a powerful force,\r\nhad hurried from Granada, and passed unobserved through the mountains in\r\nthe obscurity of the tempest. While the storm pelted the sentinel from\r\nhis post and bowled round tower and battlement, the Moors had planted\r\ntheir scaling-ladders and mounted securely into both town and castle.\r\nThe garrison was unsuspicious of danger until battle and massacre burst\r\nforth within its very walls. It seemed to the affrighted inhabitants\r\nas if the fiends of the air had come upon the wings of the wind and\r\npossessed themselves of tower and turret. The war-cry resounded on every\r\nside, shout answering shout, above, below, on the battlements of the\r\ncastle, in the streets of the town; the foe was in all parts, wrapped\r\nin obscurity, but acting in concert by the aid of preconcerted signals.\r\nStarting from sleep, the soldiers were intercepted and cut down as they\r\nrushed from their quarters, or if they escaped they knew not where\r\nto assemble or where to strike. Wherever lights appeared the flashing\r\nscimetar was at its deadly work, and all who attempted resistance fell\r\nbeneath its edge.\r\n\r\nIn a little while the struggle was at an end. Those who were not slain\r\ntook refuge in the secret places of their houses or gave themselves\r\nup as captives. The clash of arms ceased, and the storm continued its\r\nhowling, mingled with the occasional shout of the Moorish soldiery\r\nroaming in search of plunder. While the inhabitants were trembling for\r\ntheir fate, a trumpet resounded through the streets summoning them all\r\nto assemble, unarmed, in the public square. Here they were surrounded by\r\nsoldiery and strictly guarded until daybreak. When the day dawned it was\r\npiteous to behold this once-prosperous community, who had laid down to\r\nrest in peaceful security, now crowded together without distinction of\r\nage or rank or sex, and almost without raiment, during the severity of\r\na wintry storm. The fierce Muley Abul Hassan turned a deaf ear to\r\nall their prayers and remonstrances, and ordered them to be conducted\r\ncaptives to Granada. Leaving a strong garrison in both town and castle,\r\nwith orders to put them in a complete state of defence, he returned,\r\nflushed with victory, to his capital, entering it at the head of his\r\ntroops, laden with spoil and bearing in triumph the banners and pennons\r\ntaken at Zahara.\r\n\r\nWhile preparations were making for jousts and other festivities in honor\r\nof this victory over the Christians, the captives of Zahara arrived--a\r\nwretched train of men, women, and children, worn out with fatigue and\r\nhaggard with despair, and driven like cattle into the city gates by a\r\ndetachment of Moorish soldiery.\r\n\r\nDeep was the grief and indignation of the people of Granada at this\r\ncruel scene. Old men, who had experienced the calamities of warfare,\r\nanticipated coming troubles. Mothers clasped their infants to their\r\nbreasts as they beheld the hapless females of Zahara with their children\r\nexpiring in their arms. On every side the accents of pity for the\r\nsufferers were mingled with execrations of the barbarity of the king.\r\nThe preparations for festivity were neglected, and the viands which were\r\nto have feasted the conquerors were distributed among the captives.\r\n\r\nThe nobles and alfaquis, however, repaired to the Alhambra to\r\ncongratulate the king; for, whatever storms may rage in the lower\r\nregions of society, rarely do any clouds but clouds of incense rise to\r\nthe awful eminence of the throne. In this instance, however, a voice\r\nrose from the midst of the obsequious crowd, and burst like thunder\r\nupon the ears of Abul Hassan. “Woe! woe! woe! to Granada!” exclaimed the\r\nvoice; “its hour of desolation approaches. The ruins of Zahara will\r\nfall upon our heads; my spirit tells me that the end of our empire is\r\nat hand.” All shrank back aghast, and left the denouncer of woe standing\r\nalone in the centre of the hall. He was an ancient and hoary man in the\r\nrude attire of a dervise. Age had withered his form without quenching\r\nthe fire of his spirit, which glared in baleful lustre from his eyes.\r\nHe was (say the Arabian historians) one of those holy men termed santons\r\nwho pass their lives in hermitages in fasting, meditation, and prayer\r\nuntil they attain to the purity of saints and the foresight of prophets.\r\n“He was,” says the indignant Fray Antonio Agapida, “a son of Belial,\r\none of those fanatic infidels possessed by the devil who are sometimes\r\npermitted to predict the truth to their followers, but with the proviso\r\nthat their predictions shall be of no avail.”\r\n\r\nThe voice of the santon resounded through the lofty hall of the\r\nAlhambra, and struck silence and awe into the crowd of courtly\r\nsycophants. Muley Abul Hassan alone was unmoved: he eyed the hoary\r\nanchorite with scorn as he stood dauntless before him, and treated his\r\npredictions as the ravings of a maniac. The santon rushed from the royal\r\npresence, and, descending into the city, hurried through its streets and\r\nsquares with frantic gesticulations. His voice was heard in every\r\npart in awful denunciation: “The peace is broken! exterminating war is\r\ncommenced. Woe! woe! woe to Granada! its fall is at hand! desolation\r\nwill dwell in its palaces; its strong men will fall beneath the sword,\r\nits children and maidens be led into captivity. Zahara is but a type of\r\nGranada!”\r\n\r\nTerror seized upon the populace, for they considered these ravings as\r\nthe inspirations of prophecy. Some hid themselves in their dwellings as\r\nin a time of general mourning, while some gathered together in knots in\r\nthe streets and squares, alarming each other with dismal forebodings and\r\ncursing the rashness and cruelty of the king.\r\n\r\nThe Moorish monarch heeded not their murmurs. Knowing that his exploit\r\nmust draw upon him the vengeance of the Christians, he now threw off\r\nall reserve, and made attempts to surprise Castellan and Elvira, though\r\nwithout success. He sent alfaquis also to the Barbary powers, informing\r\nthem that the sword was drawn, and inviting the African princes to aid\r\nhim with men and supplies in maintaining the kingdom of Granada and the\r\nreligion of Mahomet against the violence of unbelievers.\r\n\r\nWhile discontent exhaled itself in murmurs among the common people,\r\nhowever, it fomented in dangerous conspiracies among the nobles, and\r\nMuley Abul Hassan was startled by information of a design to depose\r\nhim and place his son Boabdil upon the throne. His first measure was to\r\nconfine the prince and his mother in the Tower of Comares; then, calling\r\nto mind the prediction of the astrologers, that the youth would one day\r\nsit on the throne of Granada, he impiously set the stars at defiance.\r\n“The sword of the executioner,” said he, “shall prove the fallacy of\r\nthose lying horoscopes, and shall silence the ambition of Boabdil.”\r\n\r\nThe sultana Ayxa, apprised of the imminent danger of her son, concerted\r\na plan for his escape. At the dead of the night she gained access to\r\nhis prison, and, tying together the shawls and scarfs of herself and her\r\nfemale attendants, lowered him down from a balcony of the Alhambra to\r\nthe steep rocky hillside which sweeps down to the Darro. Here some of\r\nher devoted adherents were waiting to receive him, who, mounting him\r\non a swift horse, spirited him away to the city of Guadix, in the\r\nAlpuxarras.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nEXPEDITION OF THE MARQUES OF CADIZ AGAINST ALHAMA.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat was the indignation of King Ferdinand when he heard of the\r\nstorming of Zahara, though the outrage of the Moor happened most\r\nopportunely. The war between Castile and Portugal had come to a close;\r\nthe factions of Spanish nobles were for the most part quelled. The\r\nCastilian monarchs had now, therefore, turned their thoughts to the\r\ncherished object of their ambition, the conquest of Granada. The pious\r\nheart of Isabella yearned to behold the entire Peninsula redeemed from\r\nthe domination of the infidel, while Ferdinand, in whom religious zeal\r\nwas mingled with temporal policy, looked with a craving eye to the rich\r\nterritory of the Moor, studded with wealthy towns and cities. Muley Abul\r\nHassan had rashly or unwarily thrown the brand that was to produce the\r\nwide conflagration. Ferdinand was not the one to quench the flames. He\r\nimmediately issued orders to all the adelantados and alcaydes of the\r\nfrontiers to maintain the utmost vigilance at their several posts, and\r\nto prepare to carry fire and sword into the territories of the Moors.\r\n\r\nAmong the many valiant cavaliers who rallied round the throne of\r\nFerdinand and Isabella, one of the most eminent in rank and renowned\r\nin arms was Don Roderigo Ponce de Leon, marques of Cadiz. As he was the\r\ndistinguished champion of this holy war, and commanded in most of its\r\nenterprises and battles, it is meet that some particular account should\r\nbe given of him. He was born in 1443 of the valiant lineage of the\r\nPonces, and from his earliest youth had rendered himself illustrious in\r\nthe field. He was of the middle stature, with a muscular and powerful\r\nframe, capable of great exertion and fatigue. His hair and beard were\r\nred and curled, his countenance was open and magnanimous, of a ruddy\r\ncomplexion and slightly marked with the small-pox. He was temperate,\r\nchaste, valiant, vigilant; a just and generous master to his vassals;\r\nfrank and noble in his deportment toward his equals; loving and faithful\r\nto his friends; fierce and terrible, yet magnanimous, to his enemies.\r\nHe was considered the mirror of chivalry of his times, and compared by\r\ncontemporary historians to the immortal Cid.\r\n\r\nThe marques of Cadiz had vast possessions in the most fertile parts of\r\nAndalusia, including many towns and castles, and could lead forth an\r\narmy into the field from his own vassals and dependants. On receiving\r\nthe orders of the king he burned to signalize himself by some sudden\r\nincursion into the kingdom of Granada that should give a brilliant\r\ncommencement to the war, and should console the sovereigns for the\r\ninsult they had received in the capture of Zahara. As his estates lay\r\nnear to the Moorish frontiers and were subject to sudden inroads, he\r\nhad always in his pay numbers of adalides, or scouts and guides, many of\r\nthem converted Moors. These he sent out in all directions to watch the\r\nmovements of the enemy and to procure all kinds of information important\r\nto the security of the frontier. One of these spies came to him one\r\nday in his town of Marchena, and informed him that the Moorish town of\r\nAlhama was slightly garrisoned and negligently guarded, and might be\r\ntaken by surprise. This was a large, wealthy, and populous place within\r\na few leagues of Granada. It was situated on a rocky height, nearly\r\nsurrounded by a river, and defended by a fortress to which there was no\r\naccess but by a steep and cragged ascent. The strength of its situation\r\nand its being embosomed in the centre of the kingdom had produced the\r\ncareless security which now invited attack.\r\n\r\nTo ascertain fully the state of the fortress the marques despatched\r\nsecretly a veteran soldier who was highly in his confidence. His name\r\nwas Ortega de Prado, a man of great activity, shrewdness, and valor,\r\nand captain of escaladors (soldiers employed to scale the walls of\r\nfortresses in time of attack). Ortega approached Alhama one moonless\r\nnight, and paced along its walls with noiseless step, laying his ear\r\noccasionally to the ground or to the wall. Every time he distinguished\r\nthe measured tread of a sentinel, and now and then the challenge of\r\nthe night-watch going its rounds. Finding the town thus guarded, he\r\nclambered to the castle: there all was silent. As he ranged its lofty\r\nbattlements between him and the sky he saw no sentinel on duty.\r\nHe noticed certain places where the wall might be ascended by\r\nscaling-ladders, and, having marked the hour of relieving guard and made\r\nall necessary observations, he retired without being discovered.\r\n\r\nOrtega returned to Marchena, and assured the marques of Cadiz of\r\nthe practicability of scaling the castle of Alhama and taking it by\r\nsurprise. The marques had a secret conference with Don Pedro Enriques,\r\nadelantado of Andalusia, Don Diego de Merlo, commander of Seville,\r\nSancho de Avila, alcayde of Carmona, and others, who all agreed to\r\naid him with their forces. On an appointed day the several commanders\r\nassembled at Marchena with their troops and retainers. None but the\r\nleaders knew the object or destination of the enterprise, but it was\r\nenough to rouse the Andalusian spirit to know that a foray was intended\r\ninto the country of their old enemies, the Moors. Secrecy and celerity\r\nwere necessary for success. They set out promptly with three thousand\r\ngenetes or light cavalry and four thousand infantry. They chose a route\r\nbut little travelled, by the way of Antiquera, passing with great labor\r\nthrough rugged and solitary defiles of the sierra or chain of mountains\r\nof Arrecife, and left all their baggage on the banks of the river\r\nYeguas, to be brought after them. This march was principally in the\r\nnight; all day they remained quiet; no noise was suffered in their camp,\r\nand no fires were made, lest the smoke should betray them. On the third\r\nday they resumed their march as the evening darkened, and, forcing\r\nthemselves forward at as quick a pace as the rugged and dangerous\r\nmountain-roads would permit, they descended toward midnight into a\r\nsmall deep valley only half a league from Alhama. Here they made a halt,\r\nfatigued by this forced march, during a long dark evening toward the end\r\nof February.\r\n\r\nThe marques of Cadiz now explained to the troops the object of the\r\nexpedition. He told them it was for the glory of the most holy faith and\r\nto avenge the wrongs of their countrymen at Zahara, and that the town of\r\nAlhama, full of wealthy spoil, was the place to be attacked. The troops\r\nwere roused to new ardor by these words, and desired to be led forthwith\r\nto the assault. They arrived close to Alhama about two hours before\r\ndaybreak. Here the army remained in ambush, while three hundred men were\r\ndespatched to scale the walls and get possession of the castle. They\r\nwere picked men, many of them alcaydes and officers, men who preferred\r\ndeath to dishonor. This gallant band was guided by the escalador Ortega\r\nde Prado at the head of thirty men with scaling-ladders. They clambered\r\nthe ascent to the castle in silence, and arrived under the dark shadow\r\nof its towers without being discovered. Not a light was to be seen, not\r\na sound to be heard; the whole place was wrapped in profound repose.\r\n\r\nFixing their ladders, they ascended cautiously and with noiseless steps.\r\nOrtega was the first that mounted upon the battlements, followed by\r\none Martin Galindo, a youthful esquire full of spirit and eager for\r\ndistinction. Moving stealthily along the parapet to the portal of the\r\ncitadel, they came upon the sentinel by surprise. Ortega seized him\r\nby the throat, brandished a dagger before his eyes, and ordered him to\r\npoint the way to the guard-room. The infidel obeyed, and was instantly\r\ndespatched, to prevent his giving an alarm. The guard-room was a scene\r\nrather of massacre than combat. Some of the soldiery were killed while\r\nsleeping, others were cut down almost without resistance, bewildered by\r\nso unexpected an assault: all were despatched, for the scaling party was\r\ntoo small to make prisoners or to spare. The alarm spread throughout the\r\ncastle, but by this time the three hundred picked men had mounted the\r\nbattlements. The garrison, startled from sleep, found the enemy already\r\nmasters of the towers. Some of the Moors were cut down at once, others\r\nfought desperately from room to room, and the whole castle resounded\r\nwith the clash of arms, the cries of the combatants, and the groans of\r\nthe wounded. The army in ambush, finding by the uproar that the castle\r\nwas surprised, now rushed from their concealment, and approached\r\nthe walls with loud shouts and sound of kettle-drums and trumpets to\r\nincrease the confusion and dismay of the garrison. A violent conflict\r\ntook place in the court of the castle, where several of the scaling\r\nparty sought to throw open the gates to admit their countrymen. Here\r\nfell two valiant alcaydes, Nicholas de Roja and Sancho de Avila, but\r\nthey fell honorably, upon a heap of slain. At length Ortega de Prado\r\nsucceeded in throwing open a postern through which the marques of Cadiz,\r\nthe adelantado of Andalusia, and Don Diego de Merlo entered with a\r\nhost of followers, and the citadel remained in full possession of the\r\nChristians.\r\n\r\nAs the Spanish cavaliers were ranging from room to room, the marques of\r\nCadiz, entering an apartment of superior richness to the rest, beheld,\r\nby the light of a silver lamp, a beautiful Moorish female, the wife\r\nof the alcayde of the castle, whose husband was absent attending a\r\nwedding-feast at Velez Malaga. She would have fled at the sight of a\r\nChristian warrior in her apartment, but, entangled in the covering of\r\nthe bed, she fell at the feet of the marques, imploring mercy. That\r\nChristian cavalier, who had a soul full of honor and courtesy toward the\r\nsex, raised her from the floor and endeavored to allay her fears; but\r\nthey were increased at the sight of her female attendants pursued into\r\nthe room by the Spanish soldiery. The marques reproached his soldiers\r\nwith unmanly conduct, and reminded them that they made war upon men, not\r\non defenceless women. Having soothed the terrors of the females by the\r\npromise of honorable protection, he appointed a trusty guard to watch\r\nover the security of their apartment.\r\n\r\nThe castle was now taken, but the town below it was in arms. It was\r\nbroad day, and the people, recovered from their panic, were enabled to\r\nsee and estimate the force of the enemy. The inhabitants were chiefly\r\nmerchants and tradespeople, but the Moors all possessed a knowledge of\r\nthe use of weapons and were of brave and warlike spirit. They confided\r\nin the strength of their walls and the certainty of speedy relief\r\nfrom Granada, which was but about eight leagues distant. Manning the\r\nbattlements and towers, they discharged showers of stones and arrows\r\nwhenever the part of the Christian army without the walls attempted to\r\napproach. They barricadoed the entrances of their streets also which\r\nopened toward the castle, stationing men expert at the crossbow and\r\narquebuse. These kept up a constant fire upon the gate of the castle,\r\nso that no one could sally forth without being instantly shot down. Two\r\nvaliant cavaliers who attempted to lead forth a party in defiance of\r\nthis fatal tempest were shot dead at the very portal.\r\n\r\nThe Christians now found themselves in a situation of great peril.\r\nReinforcements must soon arrive to the enemy from Granada: unless,\r\ntherefore, they gained possession of the town in the course of the day,\r\nthey were likely to be surrounded and beleaguered, without provisions,\r\nin the castle. Some observed that even if they took the town they should\r\nnot be able to maintain possession of it. They proposed, therefore, to\r\nmake booty of everything valuable, to sack the castle, set it on fire,\r\nand make good their retreat to Seville.\r\n\r\nThe marques of Cadiz was of different counsel. “God has given the\r\ncitadel into Christian hands,” said he; “he will no doubt strengthen\r\nthem to maintain it. We have gained the place with difficulty and\r\nbloodshed; it would be a stain upon our honor to abandon it through fear\r\nof imaginary dangers.” The adelantado and Don Diego de Merlo joined\r\nin his opinion, but without their earnest and united remonstrances the\r\nplace would have been abandoned, so exhausted were the troops by forced\r\nmarches and hard fighting, and so apprehensive of the approach of the\r\nMoors of Granada.\r\n\r\nThe strength and spirits of the party within the castle were in some\r\ndegree restored by the provisions which they found. The Christian army\r\nbeneath the town, being also refreshed by a morning’s repast,\r\nadvanced vigorously to the attack of the walls. They planted their\r\nscaling-ladders, and, swarming up, sword in hand, fought fiercely with\r\nthe Moorish soldiery upon the ramparts.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the marques of Cadiz, seeing that the gate of the\r\ncastle, which opened toward the city, was completely commanded by the\r\nartillery of the enemy, ordered a large breach to be made in the wall,\r\nthrough which he might lead his troops to the attack, animating them in\r\nthis perilous moment by assuring them that the place should be given up\r\nto plunder and its inhabitants made captives.\r\n\r\nThe breach being made, the marques put himself at the head of his\r\ntroops, and entered sword in hand. A simultaneous attack was make by the\r\nChristians in every part--by the ramparts, by the gate, by the roofs\r\nand walls which connected the castle with the town. The Moors fought\r\nvaliantly in their streets, from their windows, and from the tops of\r\ntheir houses. They were not equal to the Christians in bodily strength,\r\nfor they were for the most part peaceful men, of industrious callings,\r\nand enervated by the frequent use of the warm bath; but they were\r\nsuperior in number and unconquerable in spirit; old and young, strong\r\nand weak, fought with the same desperation. The Moors fought for\r\nproperty, for liberty, for life. They fought at their thresholds and\r\ntheir hearths, with the shrieks of their wives and children ringing in\r\ntheir ears, and they fought in the hope that each moment would bring aid\r\nfrom Granada. They regarded neither their own wounds nor the death of\r\ntheir companions, but continued fighting until they fell, and seemed\r\nas if, when they could no longer contend, they would block up the\r\nthresholds of their beloved homes with their mangled bodies. The\r\nChristians fought for glory, for revenge, for the holy faith, and for\r\nthe spoil of these wealthy infidels. Success would place a rich town at\r\ntheir mercy; failure would deliver them into the hands of the tyrant of\r\nGranada.\r\n\r\nThe contest raged from morning until night, when the Moors began to\r\nyield. Retreating to a large mosque near the walls, they kept up so\r\ngalling a fire from it with lances, crossbows, and arquebuses that for\r\nsome time the Christians dared not approach. Covering themselves, at\r\nlength, with bucklers and mantelets* to protect them from the deadly\r\nshower, the latter made their way to the mosque and set fire to the\r\ndoors. When the smoke and flames rolled in upon them the Moors gave\r\nup all as lost. Many rushed forth desperately upon the enemy, but were\r\nimmediately slain; the rest surrendered themselves captives.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Mantelet--a movable parapet, made of thick planks, to protect\r\ntroops when advancing to sap or assault a walled place.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe struggle was now at an end: the town remained at the mercy of the\r\nChristians; and the inhabitants, both male and female, became the\r\nslaves of those who made them prisoners. Some few escaped by a mine or\r\nsubterranean way which led to the river, and concealed themselves, their\r\nwives and children, in caves and secret places, but in three or four\r\ndays were compelled to surrender themselves through hunger.\r\n\r\nThe town was given up to plunder, and the booty was immense. There were\r\nfound prodigious quantities of gold and silver, and jewels and rich\r\nsilks and costly stuffs of all kinds, together with horses and beeves,\r\nand abundance of grain and oil and honey, and all other productions of\r\nthis fruitful kingdom; for in Alhama were collected the royal rents\r\nand tributes of the surrounding country: it was the richest town in\r\nthe Moorish territory, and from its great strength and its peculiar\r\nsituation was called the key to Granada.\r\n\r\nGreat waste and devastation were committed by the Spanish soldiery; for,\r\nthinking it would be impossible to keep possession of the place, they\r\nbegan to destroy whatever they could not take away. Immense jars of\r\noil were broken, costly furniture shattered to pieces, and magazines\r\nof grain broken open and their contents scattered to the winds. Many\r\nChristian captives who had been taken at Zahara were found buried in a\r\nMoorish dungeon, and were triumphantly restored to light and liberty;\r\nand a renegado Spaniard, who had often served as guide to the Moors\r\nin their incursions into the Christian territories, was hanged on the\r\nhighest part of the battlements for the edification of the army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nHOW THE PEOPLE OF GRANADA WERE AFFECTED ON HEARING OF THE CAPTURE OF\r\nALHAMA, AND HOW THE MOORISH KING SALLIED FORTH TO REGAIN IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nA moorish horseman had spurred across the Vega, nor reined his panting\r\nsteed until he alighted at the gate of the Alhambra. He brought tidings\r\nto Muley Abul Hassan of the attack upon Alhama. “The Christians,” said\r\nhe, “are in the land. They came upon us, we know not whence or how, and\r\nscaled the walls of the castle in the night. There have been dreadful\r\nfighting and carnage in its towers and courts; and when I spurred\r\nmy steed from the gate of Alhama the castle was in possession of the\r\nunbelievers.”\r\n\r\nMuley Abul Hassan felt for a moment as if swift retribution had come\r\nupon him for the woes he had inflicted upon Zahara. Still, he flattered\r\nhimself that this had only been some transient inroad of a party of\r\nmarauders intent upon plunder, and that a little succor thrown into the\r\ntown would be sufficient to expel them from the castle and drive them\r\nfrom the land. He ordered out, therefore, a thousand of his chosen\r\ncavalry, and sent them in all speed to the assistance of Alhama. They\r\narrived before its walls the morning after its capture: the Christian\r\nstandards floated upon its towers, and a body of cavalry poured forth\r\nfrom its gates and came wheeling down into the plain to receive them.\r\n\r\nThe Moorish horsemen turned the reins of their steeds and galloped back\r\nfor Granada. They entered its gates in tumultuous confusion, spreading\r\nterror and lamentation by their tidings. “Alhama is fallen! Alhama is\r\nfallen!” exclaimed they; “the Christians garrison its walls; the key of\r\nGranada is in the hands of the enemy!”\r\n\r\nWhen the people heard these words they remembered the denunciation of\r\nthe santon. His prediction seemed still to resound in every ear, and\r\nits fulfilment to be at hand. Nothing was heard throughout the city but\r\nsighs and wailings. “Woe is me, Alhama!” was in every mouth; and this\r\nejaculation of deep sorrow and doleful foreboding came to be the burden\r\nof a plaintive ballad which remains until the present day.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * The mournful little Spanish romance of “Ay de mi Alhama!” is\r\nsupposed to be of Moorish origin, and to embody the grief of the people\r\nof Granada on this occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany aged men, who had taken refuge in Granada from other Moorish\r\ndominions which had fallen into the power of the Christians, now groaned\r\nin despair at the thoughts that war was to follow them into this last\r\nretreat, to lay waste this pleasant land, and to bring trouble and\r\nsorrow upon their declining years. The women were more loud and vehement\r\nin their grief, for they beheld the evils impending over their children,\r\nand what can restrain the agony of a mother’s heart? Many of them made\r\ntheir way through the halls of the Alhambra into the presence of the\r\nking, weeping, and wailing, and tearing their hair. “Accursed be the\r\nday,” cried they, “that thou hast lit the flame of war in our land! May\r\nthe holy Prophet bear witness before Allah that we and our children\r\nare innocent of this act! Upon thy head, and upon the heads of thy\r\nposterity, until the end of the world, rest the sin of the desolation of\r\nZahara!”*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Garibay, lib. 40, c. 29.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuley Abul Hassan remained unmoved amidst all this storm; his heart was\r\nhardened (observes Fray Antonio Agapida) like that of Pharaoh, to\r\nthe end that through his blind violence and rage he might produce the\r\ndeliverance of the land from its heathen bondage. In fact, he was a bold\r\nand fearless warrior, and trusted soon to make this blow recoil upon the\r\nhead of the enemy. He had ascertained that the captors of Alhama were\r\nbut a handful: they were in the centre of his dominions, within a short\r\ndistance of his capital. They were deficient in munitions of war and\r\nprovisions for sustaining a siege. By a rapid movement he might surround\r\nthem with a powerful army, cut off all aid from their countrymen, and\r\nentrap them in the fortress they had taken.\r\n\r\nTo think was to act with Muley Abul Hassan, but he was prone to act with\r\ntoo much precipitation. He immediately set forth in person with three\r\nthousand horse and fifty thousand foot, and in his eagerness to arrive\r\nat the scene of action would not wait to provide artillery and the\r\nvarious engines required in a siege. “The multitude of my forces,” said\r\nhe, confidently, “will be sufficient to overwhelm the enemy.”\r\n\r\nThe marques of Cadiz, who thus held possession of Alhama, had a chosen\r\nfriend and faithful companion-in-arms, among the most distinguished of\r\nthe Christian chivalry. This was Don Alonso de Cordova, senior and lord\r\nof the house of Aguilar, and brother of Gonsalvo of Cordova, afterward\r\nrenowned as grand captain of Spain. As yet, Alonso de Aguilar was the\r\nglory of his name and race, for his brother was but young in arms. He\r\nwas one of the most hardy, valiant, and enterprising of the Spanish\r\nknights, and foremost in all service of a perilous and adventurous\r\nnature. He had not been at hand to accompany his friend Ponce de Leon,\r\nmarques of Cadiz, in his inroad into the Moorish territory, but he\r\nhastily assembled a number of retainers, horse and foot, and pressed\r\nforward to join the enterprise. Arriving at the river Yeguas, he found\r\nthe baggage of the army still upon its banks, and took charge of it to\r\ncarry it to Alhama. The marques of Cadiz heard of the approach of his\r\nfriend, whose march was slow in consequence of being encumbered by the\r\nbaggage. He was within but a few leagues of Alhama when scouts came\r\nhurrying into the place with intelligence that the Moorish king was at\r\nhand with a powerful army. The marques of Cadiz was filled with alarm\r\nlest De Aguilar should fall into the hands of the enemy. Forgetting\r\nhis own danger and thinking only of that of his friend, he despatched a\r\nwell-mounted messenger to ride full speed and warn him not to approach.\r\n\r\nThe first determination of Alonso de Aguilar when he heard that the\r\nMoorish king was at hand was to take a strong position in the mountains\r\nand await his coming. The madness of an attempt with his handful of men\r\nto oppose an immense army was represented to him with such force as to\r\ninduce him to abandon the idea; he then thought of throwing himself into\r\nAlhama to share the fortunes of his friend; but it was now too late. The\r\nMoor would infallibly intercept him, and he should only give the marques\r\nthe additional distress of beholding him captured beneath his walls.\r\nIt was even urged upon him that he had no time for delay if he would\r\nconsult his own safety, which could only be ensured by an immediate\r\nretreat into the Christian territory. This last opinion was confirmed by\r\nthe return of scouts, who brought information that Muley Abul Hassan had\r\nreceived notice of his movements, and was rapidly advancing in quest of\r\nhim. It was with infinite reluctance that Don Alonso de Aguilar yielded\r\nto these united and powerful reasons. Proudly and sullenly he drew off\r\nhis forces, laden with the baggage of the army, and made an unwilling\r\nretreat toward Antiquera. Muley Abul Hassan pursued him for some\r\ndistance through the mountains, but soon gave up the chase and turned\r\nwith his forces upon Alhama.\r\n\r\nAs the army approached the town they beheld the fields strewn with the\r\ndead bodies of their countrymen, who had fallen in defence of the place,\r\nand had been cast forth and left unburied by the Christians. There\r\nthey lay, mangled and exposed to every indignity, while droves of\r\nhalf-famished dogs were preying upon them and fighting and howling over\r\ntheir hideous repast.* Furious at the sight, the Moors, in the first\r\ntransports of their rage, attacked those ravenous animals: their next\r\nmeasure was to vent their fury upon the Christians. They rushed like\r\nmadmen to the walls, applied scaling-ladders in all parts without\r\nwaiting for the necessary mantelets and other protections--thinking\r\nby attacking suddenly and at various points to distract the enemy and\r\novercome them by the force of numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Pulgar, Cronica.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe marques of Cadiz, with his confederate commanders, distributed\r\nthemselves along the walls to direct and animate their men in the\r\ndefence. The Moors in their blind fury often assailed the most difficult\r\nand dangerous places. Darts, stones, and all kinds of missiles were\r\nhurled down upon their defenceless heads. As fast as they mounted they\r\nwere cut down or dashed from the battlements, their ladders overturned,\r\nand all who were on them precipitated headlong below.\r\n\r\nMuley Abul Hassan stormed with passion at the sight: he sent detachment\r\nafter detachment to scale the walls, but in vain; they were like waves\r\nrushing upon a rock, only to dash themselves to pieces. The Moors lay in\r\nheaps beneath the wall, and among them many of the bravest cavaliers of\r\nGranada. The Christians also sallied frequently from the gates, and made\r\ngreat havoc in the irregular multitude of assailants.\r\n\r\nMuley Abul Hassan now became sensible of his error in hurrying from\r\nGranada without the proper engines for a siege. Destitute of all means\r\nto batter the fortifications, the town remained uninjured, defying the\r\nmighty army which raged and roamed before it. Incensed at being thus\r\nfoiled, Muley Abul Hassan gave orders to undermine the walls. The Moors\r\nadvanced with shouts to the attempt. They were received with a deadly\r\nfire from the ramparts, which drove them from their works. Repeatedly\r\nwere they repulsed, and repeatedly did they return to the charge. The\r\nChristians not merely galled them from the battlements, but issued forth\r\nand cut them down in the excavations they were attempting to form. The\r\ncontest lasted throughout a whole day, and by evening two thousand Moors\r\nwere either killed or wounded.\r\n\r\nMuley Abul Hassan now abandoned all hope of carrying the place by\r\nassault, and attempted to distress it into terms by turning the channel\r\nof the river which runs by its walls. On this stream the inhabitants\r\ndepended for their supply of water, the place being destitute of\r\nfountains and cisterns, from which circumstance it is called Alhama “la\r\nseca,” or “the dry.”\r\n\r\nA desperate conflict ensued on the banks of the river, the Moors\r\nendeavoring to plant palisades in its bed to divert the stream, and\r\nthe Christians striving to prevent them. The Spanish commanders\r\nexposed themselves to the utmost danger to animate their men, who were\r\nrepeatedly driven back into the town. The marques of Cadiz was often\r\nup to his knees in the stream fighting hand to hand with the Moors. The\r\nwater ran red with blood, and was encumbered with dead bodies. At length\r\nthe overwhelming numbers of the Moors gave them the advantage, and they\r\nsucceeded in diverting the greater part of the water. The Christians\r\nhad to struggle severely to supply themselves from the feeble rill which\r\nremained. They sallied to the river by a subterraneous passage, but the\r\nMoorish crossbowmen stationed themselves on the opposite bank, keeping\r\nup a heavy fire upon the Christians whenever they attempted to fill\r\ntheir vessels from the scanty and turbid stream. One party of the\r\nChristians had, therefore, to fight while another drew water. At all\r\nhours of the day and night this deadly strife was maintained, until it\r\nseemed as if every drop of water were purchased with a drop of blood.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the sufferings of the town became intense. None but the\r\nsoldiery and their horses were allowed the precious beverage so dearly\r\nearned, and even that in quantities that only tantalized their wants.\r\nThe wounded, who could not sally to procure it, were almost destitute,\r\nwhile the unhappy prisoners shut up in the mosques were reduced to\r\nfrightful extremities. Many perished raving mad, fancying themselves\r\nswimming in boundless seas, yet unable to assuage their thirst. Many of\r\nthe soldiers lay parched and panting along the battlements, no longer\r\nable to draw a bowstring or hurl a stone; while above five thousand\r\nMoors, stationed upon a rocky height which overlooked part of the town,\r\nkept up a galling fire into it with slings and crossbows, so that the\r\nmarques of Cadiz was obliged to heighten the battlements by using the\r\ndoors from the private dwellings.\r\n\r\nThe Christian cavaliers, exposed to this extreme peril and in imminent\r\ndanger of falling into the hands of the enemy, despatched fleet\r\nmessengers to Seville and Cordova, entreating the chivalry of Andalusia\r\nto hasten to their aid. They sent likewise, imploring assistance from\r\nthe king and queen, who at that time held their court in Medina del\r\nCampo. In the midst of their distress a tank or cistern of water was\r\nfortunately discovered in the city, which gave temporary relief to their\r\nsufferings.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nHOW THE DUKE OF MEDINA SIDONIA AND THE CHIVALRY OF ANDALUSIA HASTENED TO\r\nTHE RELIEF OF ALHAMA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe perilous situation of the Christian cavaliers, pent up and\r\nbeleaguered within the walls of the Alhama, spread terror among their\r\nfriends and anxiety throughout all Andalusia. Nothing, however, could\r\nequal the anguish of the marchioness of Cadiz, the wife of the gallant\r\nRoderigo Ponce de Leon. In her deep distress she looked round for\r\nsome powerful noble who had the means of rousing the country to the\r\nassistance of her husband. No one appeared more competent for the\r\npurpose than Don Juan de Guzman, the duke of Medina Sidonia. He was\r\none of the most wealthy and puissant grandees of Spain; his possessions\r\nextended over some of the most fertile parts of Andalusia, embracing\r\ntowns and seaports and numerous villages. Here he reigned in feudal\r\nstate like a petty sovereign, and could at any time bring into the field\r\nan immense force of vassals and retainers.\r\n\r\nThe duke of Medina Sidonia and the marques of Cadiz, however, were at\r\nthis time deadly foes. An hereditary feud existed between them, which\r\nhad often risen to bloodshed and open war; for as yet the fierce\r\ncontests between the proud and puissant Spanish nobles had not been\r\ncompletely quelled by the power of the Crown, and in this respect they\r\nexerted a right of sovereignty in leading their vassals against each\r\nother in open field.\r\n\r\nThe duke of Medina Sidonia would have appeared, to many, the very\r\nlast person to whom to apply for aid of the marques of Cadiz; but the\r\nmarchioness judged of him by the standard of her own high and generous\r\nmind. She knew him to be a gallant and courteous knight, and had already\r\nexperienced the magnanimity of his spirit, having been relieved by him\r\nwhen besieged by the Moors in her husband’s fortress of Arcos. To\r\nthe duke, therefore, she applied in this moment of sudden calamity,\r\nimploring him to furnish succor to her husband. The event showed how\r\nwell noble spirits understand each other. No sooner did the duke receive\r\nthis appeal from the wife of his enemy than he generously forgot all\r\nfeeling of animosity and determined to go in person to his succor. He\r\nimmediately despatched a courteous letter to the marchioness, assuring\r\nher that in consideration of the request of so honorable and estimable\r\na lady, and to rescue from peril so valiant a cavalier as her husband,\r\nwhose loss would be great, not only to Spain, but to all Christendom, he\r\nwould forego the recollection of all past grievances, and hasten to his\r\nrelief with all the forces he could raise.\r\n\r\nThe duke wrote at the same time to the alcaydes of his towns and\r\nfortresses, ordering them to join him forthwith at Seville with all\r\nthe forces they could spare from their garrisons. He called on all the\r\nchivalry of Andalusia to make a common cause in the rescue of those\r\nChristian cavaliers, and he offered large pay to all volunteers who\r\nwould resort to him with horses, armor, and provisions. Thus all who\r\ncould be incited by honor, religion, patriotism, or thirst of gain were\r\ninduced to hasten to his standard, and he took the field with an army\r\nof five thousand horse and fifty thousand foot.* Many cavaliers of\r\ndistinguished name accompanied him in this generous enterprise. Among\r\nthese was the redoubtable Alonso de Aguilar, the chosen friend of the\r\nmarques of Cadiz, and with him his younger brother, Gonsalvo Fernandez\r\nde Cordova, afterward renowned as the grand captain; Don Roderigo Giron\r\nalso, master of the order of Calatrava, together with Martin Alonso de\r\nMontemayor and the marques de Villena, esteemed the best lance in Spain.\r\nIt was a gallant and splendid army, comprising the flower of Spanish\r\nchivalry, and poured forth in brilliant array from the gates of Seville\r\nbearing the great standard of that ancient and renowned city.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Cronica de los Duques de Medina Sidonia, por Pedro de Medina, MS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFerdinand and Isabella were at Medina del Campo when tidings came of the\r\ncapture of Alhama. The king was at mass when he received the news, and\r\nordered “Te Deum” to be chanted for this signal triumph of the holy\r\nfaith. When the first flush of triumph had subsided, and the king learnt\r\nthe imminent peril of the valorous Ponce de Leon and his companions, and\r\nthe great danger that this stronghold might again be wrested from\r\ntheir grasp, he resolved to hurry in person to the scene of action. So\r\npressing appeared to him the emergency that he barely gave himself time\r\nto take a hasty repast while horses were providing, and then departed at\r\nfurious speed for Andalusia, leaving a request for the queen to follow\r\nhim.* He was attended by Don Beltram de la Cueva, duke of Albuquerque,\r\nDon Inigo Lopez de Mendoza, count of Tendilla, and Don Pedro Mauriques,\r\ncount of Trevino, with a few more cavaliers of prowess and distinction.\r\nHe travelled by forced journeys, frequently changing his jaded horses,\r\nbeing eager to arrive in time to take command of the Andalusian\r\nchivalry. When he arrived within five leagues of Cordova the duke of\r\nAlbuquerque remonstrated with him upon entering with such incautious\r\nhaste into the enemies’ country. He represented to him that there were\r\ntroops enough assembled to succor Alhama, and that it was not for him\r\nto venture his royal person in doing what could be done by his subjects,\r\nespecially as he had such valiant and experienced captains to act for\r\nhim. “Besides, sire,” added the duke, “Your Majesty should bethink\r\nyou that the troops about to take the field are mere men of Andalusia,\r\nwhereas your illustrious predecessors never made an inroad into the\r\nterritory of the Moors without being accompanied by a powerful force of\r\nthe stanch and iron warriors of Old Castile.”\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Illescas, Hist. Pontifical.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Duke,” replied the king, “your counsel might have been good had I not\r\ndeparted from Medina with the avowed determination of succoring these\r\ncavaliers in person. I am now near the end of my journey, and it would\r\nbe beneath my dignity to change my intention before even I had met\r\nwith an impediment. I shall take the troops of this country who are\r\nassembled, without waiting for those of Castile, and with the aid of God\r\nshall prosecute my journey.” *\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Pulgar, Cronica, p. 3, cap. 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs King Ferdinand approached Cordova the principal inhabitants came\r\nforth to receive him. Learning, however, that the duke of Medina Sidonia\r\nwas already on the march and pressing forward into the territory of the\r\nMoors, the king was all on fire to overtake him and to lead in person\r\nthe succor to Alhama. Without entering Cordova, therefore, he exchanged\r\nhis weary horses for those of the inhabitants who had come forth to meet\r\nhim, and pressed forward for the army. He despatched fleet couriers in\r\nadvance, requesting the duke of Medina Sidonia to await his coming, that\r\nhe might take command of the forces.\r\n\r\nNeither the duke nor his companions-in-arms, however, felt inclined to\r\npause in their generous expedition and gratify the inclinations of the\r\nking. They sent back missives representing that they were far within the\r\nenemies’ frontier, and it was dangerous either to pause or turn back.\r\nThey had likewise received pressing entreaties from the besieged to\r\nhasten their speed, setting forth their great sufferings and their\r\nhourly peril of being overwhelmed by the enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe king was at Ponton del Maestre when he received these missives. So\r\ninflamed was he with zeal for the success of this enterprise that he\r\nwould have penetrated into the kingdom of Granada with the handful of\r\ncavaliers who accompanied him, but they represented the rashness of such\r\na journey through the mountainous defiles of a hostile country thickly\r\nbeset with towns and castles. With some difficulty, therefore, he was\r\ndissuaded from his inclination, and prevailed upon to await tidings from\r\nthe army in the frontier city of Antiquera.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nSEQUEL OF THE EVENTS AT ALHAMA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile all Andalusia was thus in arms and pouring its chivalry through\r\nthe mountain-passes of the Moorish frontiers, the garrison of Alhama was\r\nreduced to great extremity and in danger of sinking under its sufferings\r\nbefore the promised succor could arrive. The intolerable thirst that\r\nprevailed in consequence of the scarcity of water, the incessant watch\r\nthat had to be maintained over the vast force of enemies without and\r\nthe great number of prisoners within, and the wounds which almost every\r\nsoldier had received in the incessant skirmishes and assaults, had worn\r\ngrievously both flesh and spirit. The noble Ponce de Leon, marques\r\nof Cadiz, still animated the soldiery, however, by word and example,\r\nsharing every hardship and being foremost in every danger, exemplifying\r\nthat a good commander is the vital spirit of an army.\r\n\r\nWhen Muley Abul Hassan heard of the vast force that was approaching\r\nunder the command of the duke of Medina Sidonia, and that Ferdinand was\r\ncoming in person with additional troops, he perceived that no time was\r\nto be lost: Alhama must be carried by one powerful attack or abandoned\r\nentirely to the Christians.\r\n\r\nA number of Moorish cavaliers, some of the bravest youth of Granada,\r\nknowing the wishes of the king, proposed to undertake a desperate\r\nenterprise which, if successful, must put Alhama in his power. Early one\r\nmorning, when it was scarcely the gray of the dawn, about the time\r\nof changing the watch, these cavaliers approached the town at a place\r\nconsidered inaccessible from the steepness of the rocks on which the\r\nwall was founded, which, it was supposed, elevated the battlements\r\nbeyond the reach of the longest scaling-ladder. The Moorish knights,\r\naided by a number of the strongest and most active escaladors, mounted\r\nthese rocks and applied the ladders without being discovered, for to\r\ndivert attention from them Muley Abul Hassan made a false attack upon\r\nthe town in another quarter.\r\n\r\nThe scaling party mounted with difficulty and in small numbers; the\r\nsentinel was killed at his post, and seventy of the Moors made their\r\nway into the streets before an alarm was given. The guards rushed to\r\nthe walls to stop the hostile throng that was still pouring in. A sharp\r\nconflict, hand to hand and man to man, took place on the battlements,\r\nand many on both sides fell. The Moors, whether wounded or slain, were\r\nthrown headlong without the walls, the scaling-ladders were overturned,\r\nand those who were mounting were dashed upon the rocks, and from thence\r\ntumbled upon the plain. Thus in a little while the ramparts were cleared\r\nby Christian prowess, led on by that valiant knight Don Alonzo Ponce,\r\nthe uncle, and that brave esquire Pedro Pineda, nephew, of the marques\r\nof Cadiz.\r\n\r\nThe walls being cleared, these two kindred cavaliers now hastened with\r\ntheir forces in pursuit of the seventy Moors who had gained an entrance\r\ninto the town. The main party of the garrison being engaged at a\r\ndistance resisting the feigned attack of the Moorish king, this fierce\r\nband of infidels had ranged the streets almost without opposition, and\r\nwere making their way to the gates to throw them open to the army.* They\r\nwere chosen men from among the Moorish forces, several of them gallant\r\nknights of the proudest families of Granada. Their footsteps through\r\nthe city were in a manner printed in blood, and they were tracked by the\r\nbodies of those they had killed and wounded. They had attained the gate;\r\nmost of the guard had fallen beneath their scimetars; a moment more and\r\nAlhama would have been thrown open to the enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Zurita, lib. 20, c. 43.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust at this juncture Don Alonzo Ponce and Pedro de Pineda reached the\r\nspot with their forces. The Moors had the enemy in front and rear; they\r\nplaced themselves back to back, with their banner in the centre. In\r\nthis way they fought with desperate and deadly determination, making a\r\nrampart around them with the slain. More Christian troops arrived and\r\nhemmed them in, but still they fought, without asking for quarter. As\r\ntheir number decreased they serried their circle still closer, defending\r\ntheir banner from assault, and the last Moor died at his post grasping\r\nthe standard of the Prophet. This standard was displayed from the walls,\r\nand the turbaned heads of the Moors were thrown down to the besiegers.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Pedro de Pineda received the honor of knighthood from the hand\r\nof King Ferdinand for his valor on this occasion (Alonzo Ponce was\r\nalready knight.)--See Zuniga, Annales of Seville, lib. 12, an. 1482.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuley Abul Hassan tore his beard with rage at the failure of this\r\nattempt and at the death of so many of his chosen cavaliers. He saw that\r\nall further effort was in vain; his scouts brought word that they had\r\nseen from the heights the long columns and flaunting banners of the\r\nChristian army approaching through the mountains. To linger would be\r\nto place himself between two bodies of the enemy. Breaking up his camp,\r\ntherefore, in all haste, he gave up the siege of Alhama and hastened\r\nback to Granada; and the last clash of his cymbals scarce died upon the\r\near from the distant hills before the standard of the Duke of Medina\r\nSidonia was seen emerging in another direction from the defiles of the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nWhen the Christians in Alhama beheld their enemies retreating on one\r\nside and their friends advancing on the other, they uttered shouts\r\nof joy and hymns of thanksgiving, for it was as a sudden relief\r\nfrom present death. Harassed by several weeks of incessant vigil and\r\nfighting, suffering from scarcity of provisions and almost continual\r\nthirst, they resembled skeletons rather than living men. It was a noble\r\nand gracious spectacle--the meeting of those hitherto inveterate foes,\r\nthe duke of Medina Sidonia and the marques of Cadiz. At sight of\r\nhis magnanimous deliverer the marques melted into tears: all past\r\nanimosities only gave the greater poignancy to present feelings of\r\ngratitude and admiration. The late deadly rivals clasped each other in\r\ntheir arms, and from that time forward were true and cordial friends.\r\n\r\nWhile this generous scene took place between the commanders a sordid\r\ncontest arose among their troops. The soldiers who had come to the\r\nrescue claimed a portion of the spoils of Alhama, and so violent was the\r\ndispute that both parties seized their arms. The duke of Medina\r\nSidonia interfered, and settled the question with his characteristic\r\nmagnanimity. He declared that the spoil belonged to those who had\r\ncaptured the city. “We have taken the field,” said he, “only for\r\nhonor, for religion, and for the rescue of our countrymen and\r\nfellow-Christians, and the success of our enterprise is a sufficient\r\nand a glorious reward. If we desire booty, there are sufficient Moorish\r\ncities yet to be taken to enrich us all.” The soldiers were convinced\r\nby the frank and chivalrous reasoning of the duke; they replied to his\r\nspeech by acclamations, and the transient broil was happily appeased.\r\n\r\nThe marchioness of Cadiz, with the forethought of a loving wife,\r\nhad despatched her major-domo with the army with a large supply of\r\nprovisions. Tables were immediately spread beneath the tents, where the\r\nmarques gave a banquet to the duke and the cavaliers who had accompanied\r\nhim, and nothing but hilarity prevailed in this late scene of suffering\r\nand death.\r\n\r\nA garrison of fresh troops was left in Alhama, and the veterans who had\r\nso valiantly captured and maintained it returned to their homes burdened\r\nwith precious booty. The marques and duke, with their confederate\r\ncavaliers, repaired to Antiquera, where they were received with great\r\ndistinction by the king, who honored the marques of Cadiz with signal\r\nmarks of favor. The duke then accompanied his late enemy, but now\r\nmost zealous and grateful friend, the marques of Cadiz, to his town of\r\nMarchena, where he received the reward of his generous conduct in\r\nthe thanks and blessings of the marchioness. The marques celebrated a\r\nsumptuous feast in honor of his guest; for a day and night his palace\r\nwas thrown open and was the scene of continual revel and festivity. When\r\nthe duke departed for his estates at St. Lucar the marques attended him\r\nfor some distance on his journey, and when they separated it was as the\r\nparting scene of brothers. Such was the noble spectacle exhibited to the\r\nchivalry of Spain by these two illustrious rivals. Each reaped universal\r\nrenown from the part he had performed in the campaign--the marques from\r\nhaving surprised and captured one of the most important and formidable\r\nfortresses of the kingdom of Granada, and the duke from having subdued\r\nhis deadliest foe by a great act of magnanimity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nEVENTS AT GRANADA, AND RISE OF THE MOORISH KING, BOABDIL EL CHICO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Moorish king, Abul Hassan, returned, baffled and disappointed, from\r\nbefore the walls of Alhama, and was received with groans and smothered\r\nexecrations by the people of Granada. The prediction of the santon was\r\nin every mouth, and appeared to be rapidly fulfilling, for the enemy was\r\nalready strongly fortified in Alhama, in the very heart of the kingdom.\r\nAt the same time, the nobles who had secretly conspired to depose the\r\nold king and elevate his son Boabdil to the throne had matured their\r\nplans in concert with the prince, who had been joined in Guadix by hosts\r\nof adherents. An opportunity soon presented to carry their plans into\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nMuley Abul Hassan had a royal country palace, with gardens and\r\nfountains, called the Alixares, situated on the Cerro del Sol, or\r\nMountain of the Sun, a height the ascent to which leads up from the\r\nAlhambra, but which towers far above that fortress, and looks down as\r\nfrom the clouds upon it and upon the subjacent city of Granada. It was\r\na favorite retreat of the Moorish kings to inhale the pure\r\nmountain-breezes and leave far below the din and turmoil of the city;\r\nMuley Abul Hassan had passed a day among its bowers, in company with\r\nhis favorite wife Zoraya, when toward evening he heard a strange sound\r\nrising from the city, like the gathering of a storm or the sullen roar\r\nof the ocean. Apprehensive of evil, he ordered the officers of his guard\r\nto descend with all speed to the city and reconnoitre. The intelligence\r\nbrought back was astounding. A civil war was raging in the city. Boabdil\r\nhad been brought from Guadix by the conspirators, the foremost of whom\r\nwere the gallant race of the Abencerrages. He had entered the Albaycin\r\nin triumph, and been hailed with rapture and proclaimed king in that\r\npopulous quarter of the city. Abul Cacim Vanegas, the vizier, at the\r\nhead of the royal guards had attacked the rebels, and the noise which\r\nhad alarmed the king was the din of fighting in the streets and squares.\r\n\r\nMuley Abul Hassan hastened to descend to the Alhambra, confident that,\r\nensconced in that formidable fortress, he could soon put an end to the\r\nrash commotion. To his surprise and dismay, he found the battlements\r\nlined with hostile troops: Aben Comixa, the alcayde, had declared in\r\nfavor of Boabdil and elevated his standard on the towers: thus cut off\r\nfrom his stronghold, the old monarch was fain to return to the Alixares.\r\n\r\nThe conflict lasted throughout the night with carnage on both sides. In\r\nthe morning Abul Cacim, driven out of the city, appeared before the old\r\nking with his broken squadrons, and told him there was no safety but in\r\nflight. “Allah Akbar!” (God is great!) exclaimed old Muley; “it is in\r\nvain to contend against what is written in the book of fate. It was\r\npredestined that my son should sit upon the throne--Allah forfend the\r\nrest of the prediction.” So saying, he made a hasty retreat, escorted\r\nby Abul Cacim Vanegas and his troops, who conducted him to the castle\r\nof Mondujar in the valley of Locrin. Here he was joined by many powerful\r\ncavaliers, relatives of Abul Cacim and partisans of Zoraya, among whom\r\nwere Cid Hiaya, Aben Jamy, and Reduan Vanegas, men who had alcaydes,\r\nvassals, at their command, and possessed great influence in Almeria and\r\nBaza. He was joined also by his brother Abdallah, commonly called El\r\nZagal, or the Valiant, who was popular in many parts of the kingdom. All\r\nthese offered to aid him with their swords in suppressing the rebellion.\r\n\r\nThus reinforced, Muley Abul Hassan determined on a sudden blow for the\r\nrecovery of his throne and the punishment of the rebels. He took his\r\nmeasures with that combination of dexterity and daring which formed his\r\ncharacter, and arrived one night under the walls of Granada with five\r\nhundred chosen followers. Scaling the walls of the Alhambra, he threw\r\nhimself with sanguinary fury into its silent courts. The sleeping\r\ninmates were roused from their repose only to fall by the exterminating\r\nscimetar. The rage of Abul Hassan spared neither age nor rank nor sex;\r\nthe halls resounded with shrieks and yells, and the fountains ran red\r\nwith blood. The alcayde, Aben Comixa, retreated to a strong tower with\r\na few of the garrison and inhabitants. The furious Abul Hassan did not\r\nlose time in pursuing him; he was anxious to secure the city and to\r\nwreak his vengeance on its rebellious inhabitants. Descending with his\r\nbloody band into the streets, he cut down the defenceless inhabitants\r\nas, startled from their sleep, they rushed forth to learn the cause of\r\nthe alarm. The city was soon completely roused; the people flew to arms;\r\nlights blazed in every street, revealing the scanty number of this\r\nband that had been dealing such fatal vengeance in the dark. Muley\r\nAbul Hassan had been mistaken in his conjectures: the great mass of the\r\npeople, incensed by his tyranny, were zealous in favor of his son. A\r\nviolent but transient conflict took place in the streets and squares:\r\nmany of the followers of Abul Hassan were slain, the rest driven out of\r\nthe city, and the old monarch, with the remnant of his band, retreated\r\nto his loyal city of Malaga.\r\n\r\nSuch was the commencement of those great internal feuds and divisions\r\nwhich hastened the downfall of Granada. The Moors became separated into\r\ntwo hostile factions, headed by the father and the son, the latter of\r\nwhom was called by the Spaniards “El Rey Chico,” or the Young King; but,\r\nthough bloody encounters took place between them, they never failed to\r\nact with all their separate force against the Christians as a common\r\nenemy whenever an opportunity occurred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nROYAL EXPEDITION AGAINST LOXA.\r\n\r\n\r\nKing Ferdinand held a council of war at Cordova, where it was\r\ndeliberated what was to be done with Alhama. Most of the council advised\r\nthat it should be demolished, inasmuch as, being in the centre of the\r\nMoorish kingdom, it would be at all times liable to attack, and could\r\nonly be maintained by a powerful garrison and at a vast expense. Queen\r\nIsabella arrived at Cordova in the midst of these deliberations,\r\nand listened to them with surprise and impatience. “What!” said she,\r\n“destroy the first fruits of our victories? Abandon the first place we\r\nhave wrested from the Moors? Never let us suffer such an idea to occupy\r\nour minds. It would argue fear or feebleness, and give new courage to\r\nthe enemy. You talk of the toil and expense of maintaining Alhama. Did\r\nwe doubt on undertaking this war that it was to be one of infinite cost,\r\nlabor, and bloodshed? And shall we shrink from the cost the moment a\r\nvictory is obtained and the question is merely to guard or abandon its\r\nglorious trophy? Let us hear no more about the destruction of Alhama;\r\nlet us maintain its walls sacred, as a stronghold granted us by Heaven\r\nin the centre of this hostile land; and let our only consideration be\r\nhow to extend our conquest and capture the surrounding cities.”\r\n\r\nThe language of the queen infused a more lofty and chivalrous spirit\r\ninto the royal council. Preparations were made to maintain Alhama at all\r\nrisk and expense, and King Ferdinand appointed as alcayde Luis Fernandez\r\nPuerto Carrero, senior of the house of Palma, supported by Diego Lopez\r\nde Ayala, Pero Ruiz de Alarcon, and Alonso Ortis, captains of four\r\nhundred lances and a body of one thousand foot, supplied with provisions\r\nfor three months.\r\n\r\nFerdinand resolved also to lay siege to Loxa, or Loja, a city of great\r\nstrength at no great distance from Alhama, and all-important to its\r\nprotection. It was, in fact, a military point situated in a pass of the\r\nmountains between the kingdoms of Granada and Castile, and commanded a\r\nmain entrance to the Vega. The Xenil flowed by its walls, and it had a\r\nstrong castle or citadel built on a rock. In preparing for the siege of\r\nthis formidable place Ferdinand called upon all the cities and towns of\r\nAndalusia and Estramadura, and the domains of the orders of Santiago,\r\nCalatrava, and Alcantara, and of the priory of San Juan, and the kingdom\r\nof Toledo, and beyond to the cities of Salamanca, Toro, and Valladolid,\r\nto furnish, according to their repartimientos or allotments, a certain\r\nquantity of bread, wine, and cattle to be delivered at the royal camp\r\nbefore Loxa, one half at the end of June and one half in July. These\r\nlands, also, together with Biscay and Guipuscoa, were ordered to send\r\nreinforcements of horse and foot, each town furnishing its quota,\r\nand great diligence was used in providing lombards, powder, and other\r\nwarlike munitions.\r\n\r\nThe Moors were no less active in their preparations, and sent missives\r\ninto Africa entreating supplies and calling upon the Barbary princes\r\nto aid them in this war of the faith. To intercept all succor, the\r\nCastilian sovereigns stationed an armada of ships and galleys in the\r\nStraits of Gibraltar under the command of Martin Diaz de Mina and\r\nCarlos de Valera, with orders to scour the Barbary coast and sweep every\r\nMoorish sail from the sea.\r\n\r\nWhile these preparations were making, Ferdinand made an incursion at the\r\nhead of his army into the kingdom of Granada, and laid waste the Vega,\r\ndestroying its hamlets and villages, ravaging its fields of grain, and\r\ndriving away the cattle.\r\n\r\nIt was about the end of June that King Ferdinand departed from Cordova\r\nto sit down before the walls of Loxa. So confident was he of success\r\nthat he left a great part of the army at Ecija, and advanced with but\r\nfive thousand cavalry and eight thousand infantry. The marques of Cadiz,\r\na warrior as wise as he was valiant, remonstrated against employing\r\nso small a force, and indeed was opposed to the measure altogether, as\r\nbeing undertaken precipitately and without sufficient preparation. King\r\nFerdinand, however, was influenced by the counsel of Don Diego de Merlo,\r\nand was eager to strike a brilliant and decided blow. A vainglorious\r\nconfidence prevailed about this time among the Spanish cavaliers; they\r\noverrated their own prowess, or rather they undervalued and despised\r\ntheir enemy. Many of them believed that the Moors would scarcely remain\r\nin their city when they saw the Christian troops advancing to assail it.\r\nThe Spanish chivalry, therefore, marched gallantly and fearlessly, and\r\nalmost carelessly, over the border, scantily supplied with the things\r\nneedful for a besieging army in the heart of an enemy’s country. In the\r\nsame negligent and confident spirit they took up their station before\r\nLoxa.\r\n\r\nThe country around was broken and hilly, so that it was extremely\r\ndifficult to form a combined camp. The river Xenil, which runs by the\r\ntown, was compressed between high banks, and so deep as to be fordable\r\nwith extreme difficulty; and the Moors had possession of the bridge.\r\nThe king pitched his tents in a plantation of olives on the banks of\r\nthe river; the troops were distributed in different encampments on the\r\nheights, but separated from each other by deep rocky ravines, so as to\r\nbe incapable of yielding each other prompt assistance. There was no\r\nroom for the operations of the cavalry. The artillery also was so\r\ninjudiciously placed as to be almost entirely useless. Alonso of Aragon,\r\nduke of Villahermosa and illegitimate brother of the king, was present\r\nat the siege, and disapproved of the whole arrangement. He was one of\r\nthe most able generals of his time, and especially renowned for his\r\nskill in battering fortified places. He recommended that the whole\r\ndisposition of the camp should be changed, and that several bridges\r\nshould be thrown across the river. His advice was adopted, but slowly\r\nand negligently followed, so that it was rendered of no avail. Among\r\nother oversights in this hasty and negligent expedition, the army had no\r\nsupply of baked bread, and in the hurry of encampment there was no time\r\nto erect furnaces. Cakes were therefore hastily made and baked on the\r\ncoals, and for two days the troops were supplied in this irregular way.\r\n\r\nKing Ferdinand felt, too late, the insecurity of his position, and\r\nendeavored to provide a temporary remedy. There was a height near the\r\ncity, called by the Moors Santo Albohacen, which was in front of\r\nthe bridge. He ordered several of his most valiant cavaliers to take\r\npossession of this height and to hold it as a check upon the enemy and a\r\nprotection to the camp. The cavaliers chosen for this distinguished and\r\nperilous post were the marques of Cadiz, the marques of Villena, Don\r\nRoderigo Tellez Giron, master of Calatrava, his brother the count of\r\nUrena, and Don Alonso de Aguilar. These valiant warriors and tried\r\ncompanions-in-arms led their troops with alacrity to the height, which\r\nsoon glittered with the array of arms, and was graced by several of the\r\nmost redoubtable pennons of warlike Spain.\r\n\r\nLoxa was commanded at this time by an old Moorish alcayde whose daughter\r\nwas the favorite wife of Boabdil. The name of this Moor was Ibrahim Ali\r\nAtar, but he was generally known among the Spaniards as Alatar. He had\r\ngrown gray in border warfare, was an implacable enemy of the Christians,\r\nand his name had long been the terror of the frontier. Lord of Zagra and\r\nin the receipt of rich revenues, he expended them all in paying scouts\r\nand spies and maintaining a small but chosen force with which to foray\r\ninto the Christian territories; and so straitened was he at times by\r\nthese warlike expenses that when his daughter married Boabdil her bridal\r\ndress and jewels had to be borrowed. He was now in the ninetieth year\r\nof his age, yet indomitable in spirit, fiery in his passions, sinewy and\r\npowerful in frame, deeply versed in warlike stratagem, and accounted the\r\nbest lance in all Mauritania. He had three thousand horsemen under his\r\ncommand, veteran troops with whom he had often scoured the borders, and\r\nhe daily expected the old Moorish king with reinforcements.\r\n\r\nOld Ali Atar had watched from his fortress every movement of the\r\nChristian army, and had exulted in all the errors of its commanders:\r\nwhen he beheld the flower of Spanish chivalry glittering about the\r\nheight of Albohacen, his eye flashed with exultation. “By the aid of\r\nAllah,” said he, “I will give those pranking cavaliers a rouse.”\r\n\r\nAli Atar privately and by night sent forth a large body of his chosen\r\ntroops to lie in ambush near one of the skirts of Albohacen. On the\r\nfourth day of the siege he sallied across the bridge and made a feint\r\nattack upon the height. The cavaliers rushed impetuously forth to meet\r\nhim, leaving their encampment almost unprotected. Ali Atar wheeled and\r\nfled, and was hotly pursued. When the Christian cavaliers had been drawn\r\na considerable distance from their encampment, they heard a vast shout\r\nbehind them, and, looking round, beheld their encampment assailed by the\r\nMoorish force which had been placed in ambush, and which had ascended a\r\ndifferent side of the hill. The cavaliers desisted from the pursuit, and\r\nhastened to prevent the plunder of their tents. Ali Atar, in his turn,\r\nwheeled and pursued them, and they were attacked in front and rear on\r\nthe summit of the hill. The contest lasted for an hour; the height of\r\nAlbohacen was red with blood; many brave cavaliers fell, expiring among\r\nheaps of the enemy. The fierce Ali Atar fought with the fury of a demon\r\nuntil the arrival of more Christian forces compelled him to retreat into\r\nthe city. The severest loss to the Christians in this skirmish was that\r\nof Roderigo Tellez Giron, grand master of Calatrava, whose burnished\r\narmor, emblazoned with the red cross of his order, made him a mark for\r\nthe missiles of the enemy. As he was raising his arm to make a blow\r\nan arrow pierced him just beneath the shoulder, at the open part of\r\nthe (1) corselet. The lance and bridle fell from his hands, he faltered in\r\nhis saddle, and would have fallen to the ground, but was caught by Pedro\r\nGasca, a cavalier of Avila, who conveyed him to his tent, where he died.\r\nThe king and queen and the whole kingdom mourned his death, for he was\r\nin the freshness of his youth, being but twenty-four years of age, and\r\nhad proved himself a gallant and high-minded cavalier. A melancholy\r\ngroup collected about his (2) corpse on the bloody height of Albohacen:\r\nthe knights of Calatrava mourned him as a commander; the cavaliers who\r\nwere encamped on the height lamented him as their companion-in-arms in\r\na service of peril; while the count de Urena grieved over him with the\r\ntender affection of a brother.\r\n\r\nKing Ferdinand now perceived the wisdom of the opinion of the marques of\r\nCadiz, and that his force was quite insufficient for the enterprise. To\r\ncontinue his camp in its present unfortunate position would cost him\r\nthe lives of his bravest cavaliers, if not a total defeat in case of\r\nreinforcements to the enemy. He called a council of war late in the\r\nevening of Saturday, and it was determined to withdraw the army early\r\nthe next morning to Rio Frio, a short distance from the city, and there\r\nwait for additional troops from Cordova.\r\n\r\nThe next morning early the cavaliers on the height of Albohacen began to\r\nstrike their tents. No sooner did Ali Atar behold this than he sallied\r\nforth to attack them. Many of the Christian troops, who had not heard of\r\nthe intention to change the camp, seeing the tents struck and the Moors\r\nsallying forth, supposed that the enemy had been reinforced in the\r\nnight, and that the army was on the point of retreating. Without\r\nstopping to ascertain the truth or to receive orders they fled in\r\ndismay, spreading confusion through the camp, nor did they halt until\r\nthey had reached the Rock of the Lovers, about seven leagues from Loxa.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Pulgar, Cronica.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe king and his commanders saw the imminent peril of the moment,\r\nand made face to the Moors, each commander guarding his quarter and\r\nrepelling all assaults while the tents were struck and the artillery\r\nand ammunition conveyed away. The king, with a handful of cavaliers,\r\ngalloped to a rising ground, exposed to the fire of the enemy, calling\r\nupon the flying troops and endeavoring in vain to rally them. Setting\r\nupon the Moors, he and his cavaliers charged them so vigorously, that\r\nthey put a squadron to flight, slaying many with their swords and lances\r\nand driving others into the river, where they were drowned. The Moors,\r\nhowever, were soon reinforced, and returned in great numbers. The king\r\nwas in danger of being surrounded, and twice owed his safety to the\r\nvalor of Don Juan de Ribera, senior of Montemayor.\r\n\r\nThe marques of Cadiz beheld from a distance the peril of his sovereign.\r\nSummoning about seventy horsemen to follow him, he galloped to the spot,\r\nthrew himself between the king and the enemy, and, hurling his lance,\r\ntranspierced one of the most daring of the Moors. For some time he\r\nremained with no other weapon than his sword; his horse was wounded\r\nby an arrow and many of his followers were slain; but he succeeded in\r\nbeating off the Moors and rescuing the king from imminent jeopardy, whom\r\nhe then prevailed upon to retire to less dangerous ground.\r\n\r\nThe marques continued throughout the day to expose himself to the\r\nrepeated assaults of the enemy: he was ever found in the place of the\r\ngreatest danger, and through his bravery a great part of the army and\r\ncamp was preserved from destruction.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Cura de los Palacios, c. 58.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a perilous day for the commanders, for in a retreat of the kind\r\nit is the noblest cavaliers who most expose themselves to save their\r\npeople. The duke of Medina Celi was struck to the ground, but rescued by\r\nhis troops. The count de Tendilla, whose tents were nearest to the\r\ncity, received several wounds, and various other cavaliers of the most\r\ndistinguished note were exposed to fearful jeopardy. The whole day was\r\npassed in bloody skirmishings, in which the hidalgos and cavaliers\r\nof the royal household distinguished themselves by their bravery: at\r\nlength, the encampments being all broken up and most of the artillery\r\nand baggage removed, the bloody height of Albohacen was abandoned\r\nand the neighborhood of Loxa evacuated. Several tents, a quantity of\r\nprovisions, and a few pieces of artillery were left upon the spot from\r\nthe want of horses and mules to carry them off.\r\n\r\nAli Atar hung upon the rear of the retiring army, and harassed it\r\nuntil it reached Rio Frio; Ferdinand returned thence to Cordova,\r\ndeeply mortified, though greatly benefited, by the severe lesson he had\r\nreceived, which served to render him more cautious in his campaigns and\r\nmore diffident of fortune. He sent letters to all parts excusing\r\nhis retreat, imputing it to the small number of his forces, and the\r\ncircumstance that many of them were quotas sent from various cities,\r\nand not in royal pay; in the mean time, to console his troops for their\r\ndisappointment and to keep up their spirits, he led them upon another\r\ninroad to lay waste the Vega of Granada.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nHOW MULEY ABUL HASSAN MADE A FORAY INTO THE LANDS OF MEDINA SIDONIA, AND\r\nHOW HE WAS RECEIVED.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuley Abul Hassan had mustered an army and marched to the relief of\r\nLoxa, but arrived too late; the last squadron of Ferdinand had already\r\npassed over the border. “They have come and gone,” said he, “like a\r\nsummer cloud, and all their vaunting has been mere empty thunder.” He\r\nturned to make another attempt upon Alhama, the garrison of which was\r\nin the utmost consternation at the retreat of Ferdinand, and would have\r\ndeserted the place had it not been for the courage and perseverance\r\nof the alcayde, Luis Fernandez Puerto Carrero. That brave and loyal\r\ncommander cheered up the spirits of his men and kept the old Moorish\r\nking at bay until the approach of Ferdinand, on his second incursion\r\ninto the Vega, obliged him to make an unwilling retreat to Malaga.\r\n\r\nMuley Abul Hassan felt that it would be in vain, with his inferior\r\nforce, to oppose the powerful army of the Christian monarch, but to\r\nremain idle and see his territories laid waste would ruin him in the\r\nestimation of his people. “If we cannot parry,” said he, “we can strike;\r\nif we cannot keep our own lands from being ravaged, we can ravage the\r\nlands of the enemy.” He inquired and learnt that most of the chivalry\r\nof Andalusia, in their eagerness for a foray, had marched off with the\r\nking, and left their own country almost defenceless. The territories of\r\nthe duke of Medina Sidonia were particularly unguarded: here were vast\r\nplains of pasturage covered with flocks and herds--the very country for\r\na hasty inroad. The old monarch had a bitter grudge against the duke for\r\nhaving foiled him at Alhama. “I’ll give this cavalier a lesson,” said\r\nhe, exultingly, “that will cure him of his love of campaigning.” So he\r\nprepared in all haste for a foray into the country about Medina Sidonia.\r\n\r\nMuley Abul Hassan sallied out of Malaga with fifteen hundred horse and\r\nsix thousand foot, and took the way by the sea-coast, marching through\r\nEstiponia, and entering the Christian country between Gibraltar and\r\nCastellar. The only person that was likely to molest him on this route\r\nwas one Pedro de Vargas, a shrewd, hardy, and vigilant soldier, alcayde\r\nof Gibraltar, and who lay ensconced in his old warrior rock as in a\r\ncitadel. Muley Abul Hassan knew the watchful and daring character of the\r\nman, but had ascertained that his garrison was too small to enable\r\nhim to make a sally, or at least to ensure him any success. Still,\r\nhe pursued his march with great silence and caution; sent parties in\r\nadvance to explore every pass where a foe might lie in ambush; cast\r\nmany an anxious eye toward the old rock of Gibraltar as its cloud-capped\r\nsummit was seen towering in the distance on his left; nor did he feel\r\nentirely at ease until he had passed through the broken and mountainous\r\ncountry of Castellar and descended into the plains. Here he encamped\r\non the banks of the Celemin, and sent four hundred corredors, or fleet\r\nhorsemen, armed with lances, to station themselves near Algeziras\r\nand keep a strict watch across the bay upon the opposite fortress of\r\nGibraltar. If the alcayde attempted to sally forth, they were to waylay\r\nand attack him, being almost four times his supposed force, and were to\r\nsend swift tidings to the camp. In the mean time two hundred corredors\r\nwere sent to scour that vast plain called the Campina de Tarifa,\r\nabounding with flocks and herds, and two hundred more were to ravage\r\nthe lands about Medina Sidonia. Muley Abul Hassan remained with the main\r\nbody of the army as a rallying-point on the banks of the Celemin.\r\n\r\nThe foraging parties scoured the country to such effect that they came\r\ndriving vast flocks and herds before them, enough to supply the place of\r\nall that had been swept from the Vega of Granada. The troops which had\r\nkept watch upon the rock of Gibraltar returned with word that they had\r\nnot seen a Christian helmet stirring. The old king congratulated himself\r\nupon the secrecy and promptness with which he had conducted his foray,\r\nand upon having baffled the vigilance of Pedro de Vargas.\r\n\r\nHe had not been so secret, however, as he imagined; the watchful alcayde\r\nof Gibraltar had received notice of his movements, but his garrison was\r\nbarely sufficient for the defence of his post. Luckily, there arrived at\r\nthis juncture a squadron of the armed galleys, under Carlos de Valera,\r\nrecently stationed in the Straits. Pedro de Vargas prevailed upon him\r\nto take charge of Gibraltar during his temporary absence, and forthwith\r\nsallied out at midnight at the head of seventy chosen horsemen. By his\r\ncommand alarm-fires were lighted on the mountains, signals that the\r\nMoors were on the ravage, at sight of which the peasants were accustomed\r\nto drive their flocks and herds to places of refuge. He sent couriers\r\nalso spurring in every direction, summoning all capable of bearing arms\r\nto meet him at Castellar. This was a town strongly posted on a steep\r\nheight, by which the Moorish king would have to return.\r\n\r\nMuley Abul Hassan saw by the fires blazing on the mountains that the\r\ncountry was rising. He struck his tents, and pushed forward as rapidly\r\nas possible for the border; but he was encumbered with booty and with\r\nthe vast cavalgada swept from the pastures of the Campina de Tarifa. His\r\nscouts brought him word that there were troops in the field, but he made\r\nlight of the intelligence, knowing that they could only be those of the\r\nalcayde of Gibraltar, and that he had not more than a hundred horsemen\r\nin his garrison. He threw in advance two hundred and fifty of his\r\nbravest troops, and with them the alcaydes of Marabella and Casares.\r\nBehind this van-guard followed a great cavalgada of cattle, and in the\r\nrear marched the king with the main force of his little army.\r\n\r\nIt was near the middle of a sultry summer day when they approached\r\nCastellar. De Vargas was on the watch, and beheld, by an immense cloud\r\nof dust, that they were descending one of the heights of that wild and\r\nbroken country. The van-guard and rear-guard were above half a league\r\nasunder, with the cavalgada between them, and a long and close forest\r\nhid them from each other. De Vargas saw that they could render but\r\nlittle assistance to each other in case of a sudden attack, and might\r\nbe easily thrown into confusion. He chose fifty of his bravest horsemen,\r\nand, making a circuit, took his post secretly in a narrow glen opening\r\ninto a defile between two rocky heights through which the Moors had to\r\npass. It was his intention to suffer the van-guard and the cavalgada to\r\npass, and to fall upon the rear.\r\n\r\nWhile thus lying perdu six Moorish scouts, well mounted and well armed,\r\nentered the glen, examining every place that might conceal an enemy.\r\nSome of the Christians advised that they should slay these six men and\r\nretreat to Gibraltar. “No,” said De Vargas; “I have come out for higher\r\ngame than these; and I hope, by the aid of God and Santiago, to do good\r\nwork this day. I know these Moors well, and doubt not but that they may\r\nreadily be thrown into confusion.”\r\n\r\nBy this time the six horsemen approached so near that they were on the\r\npoint of discovering the Christian ambush. De Vargas gave the word, and\r\nten horsemen rushed upon them; in an instant four of the Moors rolled in\r\nthe dust; the other two put spurs to their steeds and fled toward\r\ntheir army, pursued by the ten Christians. About eighty of the Moorish\r\nvan-guard came galloping to the relief of their companions; the\r\nChristians turned and fled toward their ambush. De Vargas kept his\r\nmen concealed until the fugitives and their pursuers came clattering\r\npell-mell into the glen. At a signal trumpet his men sallied forth\r\nwith great heat and in close array. The Moors almost rushed upon\r\ntheir weapons before they perceived them; forty of the infidels were\r\noverthrown, the rest turned their back. “Forward!” cried De Vargas; “let\r\nus give the van-guard a brush before it can be joined by the rear.” So\r\nsaying, he pursued the flying Moors down hill, and came with such force\r\nand fury upon the advance-guard as to overturn many of them at the first\r\nencounter. As he wheeled off with his men the Moors discharged their\r\nlances, upon which he returned to the charge and made great slaughter.\r\nThe Moors fought valiantly for a short time, until the alcaydes of\r\nMarabella and Casares were slain, when they gave way and fled for the\r\nrear-guard. In their flight they passed through the cavalgada of cattle,\r\nthrew the whole in confusion, and raised such a cloud of dust that the\r\nChristians could no longer distinguish objects. Fearing that the king\r\nand the main body might be at hand, and finding that De Vargas was badly\r\nwounded, they contented themselves with despoiling the slain and taking\r\nabove twenty-eight horses, and then retreated to Castellar.\r\n\r\nWhen the routed Moors came flying back upon the rear-guard, Muley Abul\r\nHassan feared that the people of Xeres were in arms. Several of his\r\nfollowers advised him to abandon the cavalgada and retreat by another\r\nroad. “No,” said the old king; “he is no true soldier who gives up his\r\nbooty without fighting.” Putting spurs to his horse, he galloped forward\r\nthrough the centre of the cavalgada, driving the cattle to the right and\r\nleft. When he reached the field of battle, he found it strewed with the\r\nbodies of upward of one hundred Moors, among which were those of the\r\ntwo alcaydes. Enraged at the sight, he summoned all his crossbowmen and\r\ncavalry, pushed on to the very gates of Castellar, and set fire to two\r\nhouses close to the walls. Pedro de Vargas was too severely wounded\r\nto sally forth in person, but he ordered out his troops, and there was\r\nbrisk skirmishing under the walls, until the king drew off and returned\r\nto the scene of the recent encounter. Here he had the bodies of the\r\nprincipal warriors laid across mules, to be interred honorably at\r\nMalaga; the rest of the slain were buried on the field of battle. Then,\r\ngathering together the scattered cavalgada, he paraded it slowly, in an\r\nimmense line, past the walls of Castellar by way of taunting his foe.\r\n\r\nWith all his fierceness, old Muley Abul Hassan had a gleam of warlike\r\ncourtesy, and admired the hardy and soldier-like character of Pedro de\r\nVargas. He summoned two Christian captives, and demanded what were the\r\nrevenues of the alcayde of Gibraltar. They told him that, among other\r\nthings, he was entitled to one out of every drove of cattle that passed\r\nhis boundaries. “Allah forbid,” cried the old monarch, “that so brave a\r\ncavalier should be defrauded of his dues!”\r\n\r\nHe immediately chose twelve of the finest cattle from the twelve droves\r\nwhich formed the cavalgada. These he gave in charge to an alfaqui to\r\ndeliver to Pedro de Vargas. “Tell him,” said he, “that I crave his\r\npardon for not having sent these cattle sooner; but I have this moment\r\nlearnt the nature of his rights, and I hasten to satisfy them with the\r\npunctuality due to so worthy a cavalier. Tell him, at the same time,\r\nthat I had no idea the alcayde of Gibraltar was so active and vigilant\r\nin collecting his tolls.”\r\n\r\nThe brave alcayde relished the stern soldier-like pleasantry of the old\r\nMoorish monarch. He ordered a rich silken vest and a scarlet mantle to\r\nbe given to the alfaqui, and dismissed him with great courtesy. “Tell\r\nHis Majesty,” said he, “that I kiss his hands for the honor he has done\r\nme, and regret that my scanty force has not permitted me to give him a\r\nmore signal reception on his coming into these parts. Had three hundred\r\nhorsemen, whom I have been promised from Xeres, arrived in time, I might\r\nhave served up an entertainment more befitting such a monarch. I trust,\r\nhowever, they will arrive in the course of the night, in which case His\r\nMajesty may be sure of a royal regale in the dawning.”\r\n\r\nMuley Abul Hassan shook his head when he received the reply of De\r\nVargas. “Allah preserve us,” said he, “from any visitation of these hard\r\nriders of Xeres! A handful of troops acquainted with the wild passes of\r\nthese mountains may destroy an army encumbered as ours is with booty.”\r\n\r\nIt was some relief to the king, however, to learn that the hardy alcayde\r\nof Gibraltar was too severely wounded to take the field in person.\r\nHe immediately beat a retreat with all speed before the close of day,\r\nhurrying with such precipitation that the cavalgada was frequently\r\nbroken and scattered among the rugged defiles of the mountains, and\r\nabove five thousand of the cattle turned back and were regained by the\r\nChristians. Muley Abul Hassan returned triumphantly with the residue to\r\nMalaga, glorying in the spoils of the duke of Medina Sidonia.\r\n\r\nKing Ferdinand was mortified at finding his incursion into the Vega of\r\nGranada counterbalanced by this inroad into his dominions, and saw that\r\nthere were two sides to the game of war, as to all other games. The only\r\none who reaped real glory in this series of inroads and skirmishings was\r\nPedro de Vargas, the stout alcayde of Gibraltar.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Alonzo de Palencia, 1. 28, c. 3, MS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nFORAY OF SPANISH CAVALIERS AMONG THE MOUNTAINS OF MALAGA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foray of old Muley Abul Hassan had touched the pride of the\r\nAndalusian chivalry, and they determined on retaliation. For this\r\npurpose a number of the most distinguished cavaliers assembled at\r\nAntiquera in the month of March, 1483. The leaders of the enterprise\r\nwere, the gallant marques of Cadiz; Don Pedro Henriquez, adelantado of\r\nAndalusia; Don Juan de Silva, count of Cifuentes and bearer of the royal\r\nstandard, who commanded in Seville; Don Alonso de Cardenas, master of\r\nthe religious and military order of Santiago; and Don Alonso de Aguilar.\r\nSeveral other cavaliers of note hastened to take part in the enterprise,\r\nand in a little while about twenty-seven hundred horse and several\r\ncompanies of foot were assembled within the old warlike city of\r\nAntiquera, comprising the very flower of Andalusian chivalry.\r\n\r\nA council of war was held by the chiefs to determine in what quarter\r\nthey should strike a blow. The rival Moorish kings were waging civil war\r\nwith each other in the vicinity of Granada, and the whole country lay\r\nopen to inroads. Various plans were proposed by the different cavaliers.\r\nThe marques of Cadiz was desirous of scaling the walls of Zahara and\r\nregaining possession of that important fortress. The master of Santiago,\r\nhowever, suggested a wider range and a still more important object. He\r\nhad received information from his adalides, who were apostate Moors,\r\nthat an incursion might be safely made into a mountainous region near\r\nMalaga called the Axarquia. Here were valleys of pasture-land well\r\nstocked with flocks and herds, and there were numerous villages and\r\nhamlets, which would be an easy prey. The city of Malaga was too\r\nweakly garrisoned and had too few cavalry to send forth any force in\r\nopposition; nay, he added, they might even extend their ravages to its\r\nvery gates, and peradventure carry that wealthy place by sudden assault.\r\n\r\nThe adventurous spirits of the cavaliers were inflamed by this\r\nsuggestion: in their sanguine confidence they already beheld Malaga\r\nin their power, and they were eager for the enterprise. The marques of\r\nCadiz endeavored to interpose a little cool caution. He likewise had\r\napostate adalides, the most intelligent and experienced on the borders:\r\namong these he placed especial reliance on one named Luis Amar, who knew\r\nall the mountains and valleys of the country. He had received from him a\r\nparticular account of these mountains of the Axarquia.* Their savage\r\nand broken nature was a sufficient defence for the fierce people who\r\ninhabited them, who, manning their rocks and their tremendous passes,\r\nwhich were often nothing more than the deep dry beds of torrents, might\r\nset whole armies at defiance. Even if vanquished, they afforded no spoil\r\nto the victor. Their houses were little better than bare walls, and they\r\nwould drive off their scanty flocks and herds to the fastnesses of the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Pulgar, in his Chronicle, reverses the case, and makes the marques\r\nof Cadiz recommend the expedition to the Axarquia; but Fray Antonio\r\nAgapida is supported in his statement by that most veracious and\r\ncontemporary chronicler, Andres Bernaldez, curate of Los Palacios.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sober counsel of the marques, however, was overruled. The cavaliers,\r\naccustomed to mountain-warfare, considered themselves and their horses\r\nequal to any wild and rugged expedition, and were flushed with the idea\r\nof terminating their foray by a brilliant assault upon Malaga.\r\n\r\nLeaving all heavy baggage at Antiquera, and all such as had horses\r\ntoo weak for this mountain-scramble, they set forth full of spirit and\r\nconfidence. Don Alonso de Aguilar and the adelantado of Andalusia led\r\nthe squadron of advance. The count of Cifuentes followed with certain\r\nof the chivalry of Seville. Then came the battalion of the most valiant\r\nRoderigo Ponce de Leon, marques of Cadiz: he was accompanied by several\r\nof his brothers and nephews and many cavaliers who sought distinction\r\nunder his banner, and this family band attracted universal attention\r\nand applause as they paraded in martial state through the streets of\r\nAntiquera. The rear-guard was led by Don Alonso Cardenas, master of\r\nSantiago, and was composed of the knights of his order and the cavaliers\r\nof Ecija, with certain men-at-arms of the Holy Brotherhood whom the king\r\nhad placed under his command. The army was attended by a great train of\r\nmules, laden with provisions for a few days’ supply until they should be\r\nable to forage among the Moorish villages. Never did a more gallant and\r\nself-confident little army tread the earth. It was composed of men full\r\nof health and vigor, to whom war was a pastime and delight. They had\r\nspared no expense in their equipments, for never was the pomp of war\r\ncarried to a higher pitch than among the proud chivalry of Spain. Cased\r\nin armor richly inlaid and embossed, decked with rich surcoats and\r\nwaving plumes, and superbly mounted on Andalusian steeds, they pranced\r\nout of Antiquera with banners flying and their various devices and\r\narmorial bearings ostentatiously displayed, and in the confidence of\r\ntheir hopes promised the inhabitants to enrich them with the spoils of\r\nMalaga.\r\n\r\nIn the rear of this warlike pageant followed a peaceful band intent\r\nupon profiting by the anticipated victories. They were not the customary\r\nwretches that hover about armies to plunder and strip the dead, but\r\ngoodly and substantial traders from Seville, Cordova, and other cities\r\nof traffic. They rode sleek mules and were clad in goodly raiment, with\r\nlong leather purses at their girdles well filled with pistoles and other\r\ngolden coin. They had heard of the spoils wasted by the soldiery at the\r\ncapture of Alhama, and were provided with moneys to buy up the jewels\r\nand precious stones, the vessels of gold and silver, and the rich silks\r\nand cloths that should form the plunder of Malaga. The proud cavaliers\r\neyed these sons of traffic with great disdain, but permitted them\r\nto follow for the convenience of the troops, who might otherwise be\r\noverburdened with booty.\r\n\r\nIt had been intended to conduct this expedition with great celerity and\r\nsecrecy, but the noise of the preparations had already reached the\r\ncity of Malaga. The garrison, it is true, was weak, but it possessed\r\na commander who was himself a host. This was Muley Abdallah, commonly\r\ncalled El Zagal, or the Valiant. He was younger brother of Muley Abul\r\nHassan, and general of the few forces which remained faithful to the old\r\nmonarch. He possessed equal fierceness of spirit with his brother, and\r\nsurpassed him in craft and vigilance. His very name was a war-cry among\r\nhis soldiery, who had the most extravagant opinion of his prowess.\r\n\r\nEl Zagal suspected that Malaga was the object of this noisy expedition.\r\nHe consulted with old Bexir, a veteran Moor, who governed the city. “If\r\nthis army of marauders should reach Malaga,” said he, “we should hardly\r\nbe able to keep them without its walls. I will throw myself with a small\r\nforce into the mountains, rouse the peasantry, take possession of\r\nthe passes, and endeavor to give these Spanish cavaliers sufficient\r\nentertainment upon the road.”\r\n\r\nIt was on a Wednesday that the pranking army of high-mettled warriors\r\nissued forth from the ancient gates of Antiquera. They marched all day\r\nand night, making their way, secretly as they supposed, through the\r\npasses of the mountains. As the tract of country they intended to maraud\r\nwas far in the Moorish territories, near the coast of the Mediterranean,\r\nthey did not arrive there until late in the following day. In passing\r\nthrough these stern and lofty mountains their path was often along the\r\nbottom of a barranco, or deep rocky valley, with a scanty stream dashing\r\nalong it among the loose rocks and stones which it had broken and rolled\r\ndown in the time of its autumnal violence. Sometimes their road was a\r\nmere rambla, or dry bed of a torrent, cut deep into the mountains and\r\nfilled with their shattered fragments. These barrancos and ramblas were\r\noverhung by immense cliffs and precipices, forming the lurking-places of\r\nambuscades during the wars between the Moors and Spaniards, as in after\r\ntimes they have become the favorite haunts of robbers to waylay the\r\nunfortunate traveller.\r\n\r\nAs the sun went down the cavaliers came to a lofty part of the\r\nmountains, commanding to the right a distant glimpse of a part of the\r\nfair vega of Malaga, with the blue Mediterranean beyond, and they hailed\r\nit with exultation as a glimpse of the promised land. As the night\r\nclosed in they reached the chain of little valleys and hamlets locked up\r\namong these rocky heights, and known among the Moors by the name of the\r\nAxarquia. Here their vaunting hopes were destined to meet with the first\r\ndisappointment. The inhabitants had heard of their approach: they\r\nhad conveyed away their cattle and effects, and with their wives and\r\nchildren had taken refuge in the towers and fastnesses of the mountains.\r\n\r\nEnraged at their disappointment, the troops set fire to the deserted\r\nhouses and pressed forward, hoping for better fortune as they advanced.\r\nDon Alonso de Aguilar and the other cavaliers in the van-guard spread\r\nout their forces to lay waste the country, capturing a few lingering\r\nherds of cattle, with the Moorish peasants who were driving them to some\r\nplace of safety.\r\n\r\nWhile this marauding party carried fire and sword in the advance and\r\nlit up the mountain-cliffs with the flames of the hamlets, the master of\r\nSantiago, who brought the rear-guard, maintained strict order, keeping\r\nhis knights together in martial array, ready for attack or defence\r\nshould an enemy appear. The men-at-arms of the Holy Brotherhood\r\nattempted to roam in quest of booty, but he called them back and rebuked\r\nthem severely.\r\n\r\nAt length they came to a part of the mountain completely broken up\r\nby barrancos and ramblas of vast depth and shagged with rocks and\r\nprecipices. It was impossible to maintain the order of march; the horses\r\nhad no room for action, and were scarcely manageable, having to scramble\r\nfrom rock to rock and up and down frightful declivities where there was\r\nscarce footing for a mountain-goat. Passing by a burning village, the\r\nlight of the flames revealed their perplexed situation. The Moors, who\r\nhad taken refuge in a watch-tower on an impending height, shouted\r\nwith exultation when they looked down upon these glistening cavaliers\r\nstruggling and stumbling among the rocks. Sallying forth from their\r\ntower, they took possession of the cliffs which overhung the ravine and\r\nhurled darts and stones upon the enemy. It was with the utmost grief of\r\nheart that the good master of Santiago beheld his brave men falling like\r\nhelpless victims around him, without the means of resistance or revenge.\r\nThe confusion of his followers was increased by the shouts of the\r\nMoors multiplied by the echoes of every crag and cliff, as if they were\r\nsurrounded by innumerable foes. Being entirely ignorant of the country,\r\nin their struggles to extricate themselves they plunged into other\r\nglens and defiles, where they were still more exposed to danger. In\r\nthis extremity the master of Santiago despatched messengers in search of\r\nsuccor. The marques of Cadiz, like a loyal companion-in-arms, hastened\r\nto his aid with his cavalry: his approach checked the assaults of the\r\nenemy, and the master was at length enabled to extricate his troops from\r\nthe defile.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, Don Alonso de Aguilar and his companions, in their\r\neager advance, had likewise got entangled in deep glens and the dry\r\nbeds of torrents, where they had been severely galled by the insulting\r\nattacks of a handful of Moorish peasants posted on the impending\r\nprecipices. The proud spirit of De Aguilar was incensed at having the\r\ngame of war thus turned upon him, and his gallant forces domineered over\r\nby mountain-boors whom he had thought to drive, like their own cattle,\r\nto Antiquera. Hearing, however, that his friend the marques of Cadiz and\r\nthe master of Santiago were engaged with the enemy, he disregarded his\r\nown danger, and, calling together his troops, returned to assist\r\nthem, or rather to partake their perils. Being once more together, the\r\ncavaliers held a hasty council amidst the hurling of stones and the\r\nwhistling of arrows, and their resolves were quickened by the sight from\r\ntime to time of some gallant companion-in-arms laid low. They determined\r\nthat there was no spoil in this part of the country to repay for the\r\nextraordinary peril, and that it was better to abandon the herds they\r\nhad already taken, which only embarrassed their march, and to retreat\r\nwith all speed to less dangerous ground.\r\n\r\nThe adalides, or guides, were ordered to lead the way out of this place\r\nof carnage. These, thinking to conduct them by the most secure route,\r\nled them by a steep and rocky pass, difficult for the foot-soldiers, but\r\nalmost impracticable to the cavalry. It was overhung with precipices,\r\nfrom whence showers of stones and arrows were poured upon them,\r\naccompanied by savage yells which appalled the stoutest heart. In some\r\nplaces they could pass but one at a time, and were often transpierced,\r\nhorse and rider, by the Moorish darts, impeding the progress of their\r\ncomrades by their dying struggles. The surrounding precipices were lit\r\nup by a thousand alarm-fires: every crag and cliff had its flame, by\r\nthe light of which they beheld their foes bounding from rock to rock and\r\nlooking more like fiends than mortal men.\r\n\r\nEither through terror and confusion or through real ignorance of the\r\ncountry their guides, instead of conducting them out of the mountains,\r\nled them deeper into their fatal recesses. The morning dawned upon them\r\nin a narrow rambla, its bottom formed of broken rocks, where once had\r\nraved along the mountain-torrent, while above there beetled great arid\r\ncliffs, over the brows of which they beheld the turbaned heads of\r\ntheir fierce and exulting foes. What a different appearance did the\r\nunfortunate cavaliers present from that of the gallant band that marched\r\nso vauntingly out of Antiquera! Covered with dust and blood and wounds,\r\nand haggard with fatigue and horror, they looked like victims rather\r\nthan like warriors. Many of their banners were lost, and not a trumpet\r\nwas heard to rally up their sinking spirits. The men turned with\r\nimploring eyes to their commanders, while the hearts of the cavaliers\r\nwere ready to burst with rage and grief at the merciless havoc made\r\namong their faithful followers.\r\n\r\nAll day they made ineffectual attempts to extricate themselves from the\r\nmountains. Columns of smoke rose from the heights where in the preceding\r\nnight had blazed the alarm-fire. The mountaineers assembled from every\r\ndirection: they swarmed at every pass, getting in the advance of\r\nthe Christians, and garrisoning the cliffs like so many towers and\r\nbattlements.\r\n\r\nNight closed again upon the Christians when they were shut up in a\r\nnarrow valley traversed by a deep stream and surrounded by precipices\r\nwhich seemed to reach the skies, and on which blazed and flared the\r\nalarm-fires. Suddenly a new cry was heard resounding along the valley.\r\n“El Zagal! El Zagal!” echoed from cliff to cliff.\r\n\r\n“What cry is that?” said the master of Santiago.\r\n\r\n“It is the war-cry of El Zagal, the Moorish general,” said an old\r\nCastilian soldier: “he must be coming in person, with the troops of\r\nMalaga.”\r\n\r\nThe worthy master turned to his knights: “Let us die,” said he, “making\r\na road with our hearts, since we cannot with our swords. Let us scale\r\nthe mountain and sell our lives dearly, instead of staying here to be\r\ntamely butchered.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, he turned his steed against the mountain and spurred him up\r\nits flinty side. Horse and foot followed his example, eager, if they\r\ncould not escape, to have at least a dying blow at the enemy. As they\r\nstruggled up the height a tremendous storm of darts and stones was\r\nshowered upon them by the Moors. Sometimes a fragment of rock came\r\nbounding and thundering down, ploughing its way through the centre\r\nof their host. The foot-soldiers, faint with weariness and hunger or\r\ncrippled by wounds, held by the tails and manes of the horses to aid\r\nthem in their ascent, while the horses, losing their foothold among\r\nthe loose stones or receiving some sudden wound, tumbled down the steep\r\ndeclivity, steed, rider, and soldier rolling from crag to crag until\r\nthey were dashed to pieces in the valley. In this desperate struggle the\r\nalferez or standard-bearer of the master, with his standard, was lost,\r\nas were many of his relations and his dearest friends. At length he\r\nsucceeded in attaining the crest of the mountain, but it was only to be\r\nplunged in new difficulties. A wilderness of rocks and rugged dells lay\r\nbefore him beset by cruel foes. Having neither banner nor trumpet by\r\nwhich to rally his troops, they wandered apart, each intent upon saving\r\nhimself from the precipices of the mountains and the darts of the enemy.\r\nWhen the pious master of Santiago beheld the scattered fragments of his\r\nlate gallant force, he could not restrain his grief. “O God!” exclaimed\r\nhe, “great is thine anger this day against thy servants. Thou hast\r\nconverted the cowardice of these infidels into desperate valor, and hast\r\nmade peasants and boors victorious over armed men of battle.”\r\n\r\nHe would fain have kept with his foot-soldiers, and, gathering them\r\ntogether, have made head against the enemy, but those around him\r\nentreated him to think only of his personal safety. To remain was to\r\nperish without striking a blow; to escape was to preserve a life that\r\nmight be devoted to vengeance on the Moors. The master reluctantly\r\nyielded to the advice. “O Lord of hosts!” exclaimed he again, “from thy\r\nwrath do I fly, not from these infidels: they are but instruments in thy\r\nhands to chastise us for our sins.” So saying, he sent the guides in the\r\nadvance, and, putting spurs to his horse, dashed through a defile of the\r\nmountains before the Moors could intercept him. The moment the master\r\nput his horse to speed, his troops scattered in all directions.\r\nSome endeavored to follow his traces, but were confounded among\r\nthe intricacies of the mountain. They fled hither and thither, many\r\nperishing among the precipices, others being slain by the Moors, and\r\nothers taken prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe gallant marques of Cadiz, guided by his trusty adalid, Luis Amar,\r\nhad ascended a different part of the mountain. He was followed by\r\nhis friend, Don Alonso de Aguilar, the adelantado, and the count\r\nof Cifuentes, but in the darkness and confusion the bands of these\r\ncommanders became separated from each other. When the marques attained\r\nthe summit, he looked around for his companions-in-arms, but they were\r\nno longer following him, and there was no trumpet to summon them. It was\r\na consolation to the marques, however, that his brothers and several of\r\nhis relations, with a number of his retainers, were still with him:\r\nhe called his brothers by name, and their replies gave comfort to his\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nHis guide now led the way into another valley, where he would be less\r\nexposed to danger: when he had reached the bottom of it the marques\r\npaused to collect his scattered followers and to give time for his\r\nfellow-commanders to rejoin him. Here he was suddenly assailed by the\r\ntroops of El Zagal, aided by the mountaineers from the cliffs. The\r\nChristians, exhausted and terrified, lost all presence of mind: most of\r\nthem fled, and were either slain or taken captive. The marques and his\r\nvaliant brothers, with a few tried friends, made a stout resistance. His\r\nhorse was killed under him; his brothers, Don Diego and Don Lope, with\r\nhis two nephews, Don Lorenzo and Don Manuel, were one by one swept from\r\nhis side, either transfixed with darts and lances by the soldiers of El\r\nZagal or crushed by stones from the heights. The marques was a veteran\r\nwarrior, and had been in many a bloody battle, but never before had\r\ndeath fallen so thick and close around him. When he saw his remaining\r\nbrother, Don Beltran, struck out of his saddle by a fragment of a rock\r\nand his horse running wildly about without his rider, he gave a cry\r\nof anguish and stood bewildered and aghast. A few faithful followers\r\nsurrounded him and entreated him to fly for his life. He would still\r\nhave remained, to have shared the fortunes of his friend Don Alonso de\r\nAguilar and his other companions-in-arms, but the forces of El Zagal\r\nwere between him and them, and death was whistling by on every wind.\r\nReluctantly, therefore, he consented to fly. Another horse was brought\r\nhim: his faithful adalid guided him by one of the steepest paths, which\r\nlasted for four leagues, the enemy still hanging on his traces and\r\nthinning the scanty ranks of his followers. At length the marques\r\nreached the extremity of the mountain-defiles, and with a haggard\r\nremnant of his men escaped by dint of hoof to Antiquera.\r\n\r\nThe count of Cifuentes, with a few of his retainers, in attempting to\r\nfollow the marques of Cadiz wandered into a narrow pass, where they were\r\ncompletely surrounded by the band of El Zagal. The count himself was\r\nassailed by six of the enemy, against whom he was defending himself with\r\ndesperation, when their leader, struck with the inequality of the fight,\r\nordered the others to desist, and continued the combat alone. The count,\r\nalready exhausted, was soon compelled to surrender; his brother, Don\r\nPedro de Silva, and the few of his retainers who survived, were\r\nlikewise taken prisoners. The Moorish cavalier who had manifested such a\r\nchivalrous spirit in encountering the count singly was (3) Reduan Vanegas,\r\nbrother of the former vizier of Muley Abul Hassan, and one of the\r\nleaders of the faction of the sultana Zoraya.\r\n\r\nThe dawn of day found Don Alonso de Aguilar with a handful of his\r\nfollowers still among the mountains. They had attempted to follow the\r\nmarques of Cadiz, but had been obliged to pause and defend themselves\r\nagainst the thickening forces of the enemy. They at length traversed\r\nthe mountain, and reached the same valley where the marques had made his\r\nlast disastrous stand. Wearied and perplexed, they sheltered themselves\r\nin a natural grotto under an overhanging rock, which kept off the darts\r\nof the enemy, while a bubbling fountain gave them the means of slaking\r\ntheir raging thirst and refreshing their exhausted steeds. As day\r\nbroke the scene of slaughter unfolded its horrors. There lay the noble\r\nbrothers and nephews of the gallant marques, transfixed with darts\r\nor gashed and bruised with unseemly wounds, while many other gallant\r\ncavaliers lay stretched out dead and dying around, some of them partly\r\nstripped and plundered by the Moors. De Aguilar was a pious knight, but\r\nhis piety was not humble and resigned, like that of the worthy master\r\nof Santiago. He imprecated holy curses upon the infidels for having thus\r\nlaid low the flower of Christian chivalry, and he vowed in his heart\r\nbitter vengeance upon the surrounding country.\r\n\r\nBy degrees the little force of De Aguilar was augmented by numbers of\r\nfugitives who issued from caves and chasms where they had taken refuge\r\nin the night. A little band of mounted knights was gradually formed,\r\nand, the Moors having abandoned the heights to collect the spoils of\r\nthe slain, this gallant but forlorn squadron was enabled to retreat to\r\nAntiquera.\r\n\r\nThis disastrous affair lasted from Thursday evening, throughout Friday,\r\nthe twenty-first of March, the festival of St. Benedict. It is still\r\nrecorded in Spanish calendars as the defeat of the mountains of Malaga,\r\nand the spot where the greatest slaughter took place is called “la\r\nCuesta de la Matanza,” or the Hill of the Massacre. The principal\r\nleaders who survived returned to Antiquera. Many of the knights took\r\nrefuge in Alhama and other towns: many wandered about the mountains for\r\neight days, living on roots and herbs, hiding themselves during the day\r\nand sallying forth at night. So enfeebled and disheartened were they\r\nthat they offered no resistance if attacked. Three or four soldiers\r\nwould surrender to a Moorish peasant, and even the women of Malaga\r\nsallied forth and made prisoners. Some were thrown into the dungeons of\r\nfrontier towns, others led captive to Granada, but by far the greater\r\nnumber were conducted to Malaga, the city they had threatened to attack.\r\nTwo hundred and fifty principal cavaliers, alcaydes, commanders, and\r\nhidalgos of generous blood were confined in the alcazaba, or citadel, of\r\nMalaga to await their ransom, and five hundred and seventy of the common\r\nsoldiery were crowded in an enclosure or courtyard of the alcazaba to be\r\nsold as slaves.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Cura de los Palacios.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat spoils were collected of splendid armor and weapons taken from the\r\nslain or thrown away by the cavaliers in their flight, and many horses,\r\nmagnificently caparisoned, together with numerous standards,--all which\r\nwere paraded in triumph in the Moorish towns.\r\n\r\nThe merchants also who had come with the army, intending to traffic\r\nin the spoils of the Moors, were themselves made objects of traffic.\r\nSeveral of them were driven like cattle before the Moorish viragoes to\r\nthe market of Malaga, and, in spite of all their adroitness in trade and\r\ntheir attempts to buy themselves off at a cheap ransom, they were unable\r\nto purchase their freedom without such draughts upon their money-bags at\r\nhome as drained them to the very bottom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF THE DISASTERS AMONG THE MOUNTAINS OF MALAGA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe people of Antiquera had scarcely recovered from the tumult of\r\nexcitement and admiration caused by the departure of the gallant band of\r\ncavaliers upon their foray when they beheld the scattered wrecks flying\r\nfor refuge to their walls. Day after day and hour after hour brought\r\nsome wretched fugitive, in whose battered plight and haggard woebegone\r\ndemeanor it was almost impossible to recognize the warrior who had\r\nlately issued so gayly and gloriously from their gates.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the marques of Cadiz almost alone, covered with dust and\r\nblood, his armor shattered and defaced, his countenance the picture of\r\ndespair, filled every heart with sorrow, for he was greatly beloved by\r\nthe people. The multitude asked of his companions where was the band of\r\nbrothers which had rallied round him as he went forth to the field, and\r\nwhen told that one by one they had been slaughtered at his side, they\r\nhushed their voices or spake to each other only in whispers as he\r\npassed, gazing at him in silent sympathy. No one attempted to console\r\nhim in so great an affliction, nor did the good marques speak ever\r\na word, but, shutting himself up, brooded in lonely anguish over his\r\nmisfortune. It was only the arrival of Don Alonso de Aguilar that gave\r\nhim a gleam of consolation, rejoicing to find that amidst the shafts of\r\ndeath which had fallen so thickly among his family his chosen friend and\r\nbrother-in-arms had escaped uninjured.\r\n\r\nFor several days every eye was turned in fearful suspense toward the\r\nMoorish border, anxiously looking in every fugitive from the mountains\r\nfor the lineaments of some friend or relative whose fate was yet a\r\nmystery. At length every hope and doubt subsided into certainty; the\r\nwhole extent of this great calamity was known, spreading grief and\r\nconsternation throughout the land and laying desolate the pride and\r\nhopes of palaces. It was a sorrow that visited the marble hall and\r\nsilken pillow. Stately dames mourned over the loss of their sons, the\r\njoy and glory of their age, and many a fair cheek was blanched with woe\r\nwhich had lately mantled with secret admiration. “All Andalusia,” says a\r\nhistorian of the time, “was overwhelmed by a great affliction; there was\r\nno drying of the eyes which wept in her.” *\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Cura de los Palacios.\r\n\r\n\r\nFear and trembling reigned for a time along the frontier. Their spear\r\nseemed broken, their buckler cleft in twain: every border town dreaded\r\nan attack, and the mother caught her infant to her bosom when the\r\nwatch-dog howled in the night, fancying it the war-cry of the Moor. All\r\nfor a time seemed lost, and despondency even found its way to the royal\r\nbreasts of Ferdinand and Isabella amidst the splendors of their court.\r\n\r\nGreat, on the other hand, was the joy of the Moors when they saw whole\r\nlegions of Christian warriors brought captive into their towns by rude\r\nmountain-peasantry. They thought it the work of Allah in favor of the\r\nfaithful. But when they recognized among the captives thus dejected and\r\nbroken down some of the proudest of Christian chivalry; when they saw\r\nseveral of the banners and devices of the noblest houses of Spain, which\r\nthey had been accustomed to behold in the foremost of the battle,\r\nnow trailed ignominiously through their streets; when, in short,\r\nthey witnessed the arrival of the count of Cifuentes, the royal\r\nstandard-bearer of Spain, with his gallant brother, Don Pedro de Silva,\r\nbrought prisoners into the gates of Granada,--there were no bounds to\r\ntheir exultation. They thought that the days of their ancient glory were\r\nabout to return, and that they were to renew their career of triumph\r\nover the unbelievers.\r\n\r\nThe Christian historians of the time are sorely perplexed to account\r\nfor this misfortune, and why so many Christian knights, fighting in the\r\ncause of the holy faith, should thus miraculously, as it were, be given\r\ncaptive to a handful of infidel boors, for we are assured that all this\r\nrout and destruction was effected by five hundred foot and fifty horse,\r\nand those mere mountaineers without science or discipline.* “It\r\nwas intended,” observes one historiographer, “as a lesson to their\r\nconfidence and vainglory, overrating their own prowess and thinking that\r\nso chosen a band of chivalry had but to appear in the land of the enemy\r\nand conquer. It was to teach them that the race is not to the swift nor\r\nthe battle to the strong, but that God alone giveth the victory.”\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Cura de los Palacios.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe worthy father Fray Antonio Agapida, however, asserts it to be a\r\npunishment for the avarice of the Spanish warriors. They did not enter\r\nthe kingdom of the infidels with the pure spirit of Christian knights,\r\nzealous only for the glory of the faith, but rather as greedy men of\r\ntraffic, to enrich themselves by vending the spoils of the infidels.\r\nInstead of preparing themselves by confession and communion, and\r\nexecuting their testaments, and making donations and bequests to\r\nchurches and convents, they thought only of arranging bargains and sales\r\nof their anticipated booty. Instead of taking with them holy monks\r\nto aid them with their prayers, they were followed by a train of\r\ntrading-men to keep alive their worldly and sordid ideas, and to turn\r\nwhat ought to be holy triumphs into scenes of brawling traffic. Such is\r\nthe opinion of the excellent Agapida, in which he is joined by that most\r\nworthy and upright of chroniclers, the curate of Los Palacios. Agapida\r\ncomforts himself, however, with the reflection that this visitation\r\nwas meant in mercy to try the Castilian heart, and to extract from its\r\npresent humiliation the elements of future success, as gold is extracted\r\nfrom amidst the impurities of earth; and in this reflection he is\r\nsupported by the venerable historian Pedro Abarca of the Society of\r\nJesuits.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Abarca, Anales de Aragon, Rey 30, cap. 2, \\0xA4 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nHOW KING BOABDIL EL CHICO MARCHED OVER THE BORDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe defeat of the Christian cavaliers among the mountains of Malaga,\r\nand the successful inroad of Muley Abul Hassan into the lands of Medina\r\nSidonia, had produced a favorable effect on the fortunes of the old\r\nmonarch. The inconstant populace began to shout forth his name in the\r\nstreets, and to sneer at the inactivity of his son Boabdil el Chico. The\r\nlatter, though in the flower of his age and distinguished for vigor and\r\ndexterity in jousts and tournaments, had never yet fleshed his weapon\r\nin the field of battle; and it was murmured that he preferred the silken\r\nrepose of the cool halls of the Alhambra to the fatigue and danger of\r\nthe foray and the hard encampments of the mountains.\r\n\r\nThe popularity of these rival kings depended upon their success against\r\nthe Christians, and Boabdil el Chico found it necessary to strike some\r\nsignal blow to counterbalance the late triumph of his father. He was\r\nfurther incited by his father-in-law, Ali Atar, alcayde of Loxa, with\r\nwhom the coals of wrath against the Christians still burned among the\r\nashes of age, and had lately been blown into a flame by the attack made\r\nby Ferdinand on the city under his command.\r\n\r\n\r\nAli Atar informed Boabdil that the late discomfiture of the Christian\r\nknights had stripped Andalusia of the prime of her chivalry and broken\r\nthe spirit of the country. All the frontier of Cordova and Ecija now lay\r\nopen to inroad; but he especially pointed out the city of Lucena as an\r\nobject of attack, being feebly garrisoned and lying in a country rich in\r\npasturage, abounding in cattle and grain, in oil and wine. The fiery old\r\nMoor spoke from thorough information, for he had made many an incursion\r\ninto these parts, and his very name was a terror throughout the country.\r\nIt had become a by-word in the garrison of Loxa to call Lucena the\r\ngarden of Ali Atar, for he was accustomed to forage its fertile\r\nterritories for all his supplies.\r\n\r\nBoabdil el Chico listened to the persuasions of this veteran of the\r\nborders. He assembled a force of nine thousand foot and seven hundred\r\nhorse, most of them his own adherents, but many the partisans of his\r\nfather; for both factions, however they might fight among themselves,\r\nwere ready to unite in any expedition against the Christians. Many of\r\nthe most illustrious and valiant of the Moorish nobility assembled\r\nround his standard, magnificently arrayed in sumptuous armor and rich\r\nembroidery, as though for a festival or a tilt of canes rather than an\r\nenterprise of iron war. Boabdil’s mother, the sultana Ayxa la Horra,\r\narmed him for the field, and gave him her benediction as she girded his\r\nscimetar to his side. His favorite wife Morayma wept as she thought of\r\nthe evils that might befall him. “Why dost thou weep, daughter of Ali\r\nAtar?” said the high-minded Ayxa: “these tears become not the daughter\r\nof a warrior nor the wife of a king. Believe me there lurks more danger\r\nfor a monarch within the strong walls of a palace than within the frail\r\ncurtains of a tent. It is by perils in the field that thy husband must\r\npurchase security on his throne.”\r\n\r\nBut Morayma still hung upon his neck with tears and sad forebodings, and\r\nwhen he departed from the Alhambra she betook herself to her mirador,\r\noverlooking the Vega, whence she watched the army as it went in shining\r\norder along the road leading to Loxa, and every burst of warlike melody\r\nthat came swelling on the breeze was answered by a gush of sorrow.\r\n\r\nAs the royal cavalcade issued from the palace and descended through the\r\nstreets of Granada the populace greeted their youthful sovereign with\r\nshouts, anticipating deeds of prowess that would wither the laurels of\r\nhis father. The appearance of Boabdil was well calculated to captivate\r\nthe public eye, if we may judge from the description given by the\r\nabbot of Rute in his manuscript history of the House of Cordova. He\r\nwas mounted on a superb white charger magnificently caparisoned. His\r\ncorselets were of polished steel richly ornamented, studded with gold\r\nnails, and lined with crimson velvet. He wore a steel casque exquisitely\r\nchiselled and embossed; his scimetar and dagger of Damascus were of\r\nhighest temper; he had a round buckler at his shoulder and bore a\r\nponderous lance. In passing through the gate of Elvira, however, he\r\naccidentally broke his lance against the arch. At this certain of his\r\nnobles turned pale and entreated him to turn back, for they regarded\r\nit as an evil omen. Boabdil scoffed at their fears as idle fancies. He\r\nrefused to take another spear, but drew forth his scimetar and led the\r\nway (adds Agapida) in an arrogant and haughty style, as though he would\r\nset both Heaven and earth at defiance. Another evil omen was sent to\r\ndeter him from his enterprise: arriving at the rambla, or dry ravine, of\r\nBeyro, which is scarcely a bowshot from the city, a fox ran through the\r\nwhole army and close by the person of the king, and, though a thousand\r\nbolts were discharged at it, escaped uninjured to the mountains.\r\nThe principal courtiers now reiterated their remonstrances against\r\nproceeding; the king, however, was not to be dismayed by these portents,\r\nbut continued to march forward.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Marmol, Rebel. de los Moros, lib. 1, c. xii., fol. 14.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Loxa the army was reinforced by old Ali Atar with the chosen horsemen\r\nof his garrison and many of the bravest warriors of the border towns.\r\nThe people of Loxa shouted with exultation when they beheld Ali Atar\r\narmed at all points and mounted on his Barbary steed, which had often\r\nborne him over the borders. The veteran warrior, with nearly a century\r\nof years upon his head, had all the fire and animation of youth at the\r\nprospect of a foray, and careered from rank to rank with the velocity of\r\nan Arab of the desert. The populace watched the army as it paraded over\r\nthe bridge and wound into the passes of the mountains, and still their\r\neyes were fixed upon the pennon of Ali Atar as if it bore with it an\r\nassurance of victory.\r\n\r\nThe Moorish army entered the Christian frontier by forced marches,\r\nhastily ravaging the country, driving off the flocks and herds, and\r\nmaking captives of the inhabitants. They pressed on furiously, and made\r\nthe latter part of their march in the night, to elude observation and\r\ncome upon Lucena by surprise. Boabdil was inexperienced in warfare, but\r\nhad a veteran counsellor in his old father-in-law; for Ali Atar knew\r\nevery secret of the country, and as he prowled through it his eye\r\nranged over the land, uniting in its glare the craft of the fox with\r\nthe sanguinary ferocity of the wolf. He had flattered himself that their\r\nmarch had been so rapid as to outstrip intelligence, and that Lucena\r\nwould be an easy capture, when suddenly he beheld alarm-fires blazing\r\nupon the mountains. “We are discovered,” said he to Boabdil; “the\r\ncountry will be up in arms; we have nothing left but to strike boldly\r\nfor Lucena: it is but slightly garrisoned, and we may carry it by\r\nassault before it can receive assistance.” The king approved of his\r\ncounsel, and they marched rapidly for the gate of Lucena.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nHOW THE COUNT DE CABRA SALLIED FORTH FROM HIS CASTLE IN QUEST OF KING\r\nBOABDIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nDon Diego de Cordova, count of Cabra, was in the castle of Vaena, which,\r\nwith the town of the same name, is situated on a lofty sun-burnt hill\r\non the frontier of the kingdom of Cordova and but a few leagues from\r\nLucena. The range of mountains of Horquera lies between them. The castle\r\nof Vaena was strong and well furnished with arms, and the count had a\r\nnumerous band of vassals and retainers; for it behooved the noblemen\r\nof the frontiers in those times to be well prepared with man and horse,\r\nwith lance and buckler, to resist the sudden incursions of the Moors.\r\nThe count of Cabra was a hardy and experienced warrior, shrewd in\r\ncouncil, prompt in action, rapid and fearless in the field. He was one\r\nof the bravest of cavaliers for an inroad, and had been quickened and\r\nsharpened in thought and action by living on the borders.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 20th of April, 1483, the count was about to retire\r\nto rest when the watchman from the turret brought him word that there\r\nwere alarm-fires on the mountains of Horquera, and that they were made\r\non the signal-tower overhanging the defile through which the road passes\r\nto Cabra and Lucena.\r\n\r\nThe count ascended the battlement and beheld five lights blazing on the\r\ntower--a sign that there was a Moorish army attacking some place on the\r\nfrontier. The count instantly ordered the alarm-bells to be sounded, and\r\ndespatched couriers to rouse the commanders of the neighboring towns.\r\nHe called upon his retainers to prepare for action, and sent a trumpet\r\nthrough the town summoning the men to assemble at the castle-gate at\r\ndaybreak armed and equipped for the field.\r\n\r\nThroughout the remainder of the night the castle resounded with the\r\ndin of preparation. Every house in the town was in equal bustle, for\r\nin these frontier towns every house had its warrior, and the lance and\r\nbuckler were ever hanging against the wall ready to be snatched down for\r\ninstant service. Nothing was heard but the din of armorers, the\r\nshoeing of steeds, and furbishing up of weapons, and all night long the\r\nalarm-fires kept blazing on the mountains.\r\n\r\nWhen the morning dawned the count of Cabra sallied forth at the head of\r\ntwo hundred and fifty cavaliers of the best families of Vaena, all well\r\nappointed, exercised in arms, and experienced in the warfare of the\r\nborders. There were besides twelve hundred foot-soldiers, brave and\r\nwell-seasoned men of the same town. The count ordered them to hasten\r\nforward, whoever could make most speed, taking the road to Cabra, which\r\nwas three leagues distant. That they might not loiter on the road he\r\nallowed none of them to break their fast until they arrived at that\r\nplace. The provident count despatched couriers in advance, and the\r\nlittle army on reaching Cabra found tables spread with food and\r\nrefreshments at the gates of the town. Here they were joined by Don\r\nAlonso de Cordova, senior of Zuheros.\r\n\r\nHaving made a hearty repast, they were on the point of resuming their\r\nmarch when the count discovered that in the hurry of his departure from\r\nhome he had forgotten to bring the standard of Vaena, which for upward\r\nof eighty years had always been borne to battle by his family. It was\r\nnow noon, and there was no time to return: he took, therefore, the\r\nstandard of Cabra, the device of which is a goat, and which had not\r\nbeen seen in the wars for the last half century. When about to depart\r\na courier came galloping at full speed, bringing missives to the count\r\nfrom his nephew, Don Diego Fernandez de Cordova, senior of Lucena and\r\nalcayde de los Donceles,* entreating him to hasten to his aid, as his\r\ntown was beset by the Moorish king, Boabdil el Chico, with a powerful\r\narmy, who were actually setting fire to the gates.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * The “Donceles” were young cavaliers who had been pages in\r\nthe royal household, but now formed an elite corps in the army.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe count put his little army instantly in movement for Lucena, which\r\nis only one league from Cabra; he was fired with the idea of having the\r\nMoorish king in person to contend with. By the time he reached Lucena\r\nthe Moors had desisted from the attack and were ravaging the surrounding\r\ncountry. He entered the town with a few of his cavaliers, and was\r\nreceived with joy by his nephew, whose whole force consisted but of\r\neighty horse and three hundred foot. Don Diego Fernandez de Cordova was\r\na young man, yet he was a prudent, careful, and capable officer. Having\r\nlearnt, the evening before, that the Moors had passed the frontiers,\r\nhe had gathered within his walls all the women and children from the\r\nenvirons, had armed the men, sent couriers in all directions for succor,\r\nand had lighted alarm-fires on the mountains.\r\n\r\nBoabdil had arrived with his army at daybreak, and had sent in a message\r\nthreatening to put the garrison to the sword if the place were not\r\ninstantly surrendered. The messenger was a Moor of Granada, named\r\nHamet, whom Don Diego had formerly known: he contrived to amuse him with\r\nnegotiation to gain time for succor to arrive. The fierce old Ali Atar,\r\nlosing all patience, had made an assault upon the town and stormed like\r\na fury at the gate, but had been repulsed. Another and more serious\r\nattack was expected in the course of the night.\r\n\r\nWhen the count de Cabra had heard this account of the situation of\r\naffairs, he turned to his nephew with his usual alacrity of manner, and\r\nproposed that they should immediately sally forth in quest of the enemy.\r\nThe prudent Don Diego remonstrated at the rashness of attacking so great\r\na force with a mere handful of men. “Nephew,” said the count, “I came\r\nfrom Vaena with a determination to fight this Moorish king, and I will\r\nnot be disappointed.”\r\n\r\n“At any rate,” replied Don Diego, “let us wait but two hours, and we\r\nshall have reinforcements which have been promised me from Rambla,\r\nSantaella, Montilla, and other places in the neighborhood.” “If we\r\nawait these,” said the hardy count, “the Moors will be off, and all our\r\ntrouble will have been in vain. You may await them if you please; I am\r\nresolved on fighting.”\r\n\r\nThe count paused for no reply, but in his prompt and rapid manner\r\nsallied forth to his men. The young alcayde de los Donceles, though more\r\nprudent than his ardent uncle, was equally brave; he determined to stand\r\nby him in his rash enterprise, and, summoning his little force,\r\nmarched forth to join the count, who was already on the move. They then\r\nproceeded together in quest of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe Moorish army had ceased ravaging the country, and was not to be\r\nseen, the neighborhood being hilly and broken with deep ravines. The\r\ncount despatched six scouts on horseback to reconnoitre, ordering them\r\nto return with all speed on discovering the enemy, and by no means to\r\nengage in skirmishing with stragglers. The scouts, ascending a high\r\nhill, beheld the Moorish army in a valley behind it, the cavalry ranged\r\nin five battalions keeping guard, while the foot-soldiers were seated\r\non the grass making a repast. They returned immediately with the\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\nThe count now ordered the troops to march in the direction of the enemy.\r\nHe and his nephew ascended the hill, and saw that the five battalions\r\nof Moorish cavalry had been formed into two, one of about nine hundred\r\nlances, the other of about six hundred. The whole force seemed prepared\r\nto march for the frontier. The foot-soldiers were already under way with\r\nmany prisoners and a great train of mules and beasts of burden\r\nladen with booty. At a distance was Boabdil el Chico: they could not\r\ndistinguish his person, but they knew him by his superb black and white\r\ncharger, magnificently caparisoned, and by his being surrounded by a\r\nnumerous guard sumptuously armed and attired. Old Ali Atar was careering\r\nabout the valley with his usual impatience, hurrying the march of the\r\nloitering troops.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the count de Cabra glistened with eager joy as he beheld\r\nthe royal prize within his reach. The immense disparity of their forces\r\nnever entered into his mind. “By Santiago!” said he to his nephew as\r\nthey hastened down the hill, “had we waited for more forces the Moorish\r\nking and his army would have escaped us.”\r\n\r\nThe count now harangued his men to inspirit them to this hazardous\r\nencounter. He told them not to be dismayed at the number of the Moors,\r\nfor God often permitted the few to conquer the many, and he had great\r\nconfidence that through the divine aid they were that day to achieve\r\na signal victory which should win them both riches and renown. He\r\ncommanded that no man should hurl his lance at the enemy, but should\r\nkeep it in his hands and strike as many blows with it as he could. He\r\nwarned them also never to shout except when the Moors did, for when\r\nboth armies shouted together there was no perceiving which made the most\r\nnoise and was the strongest. He desired his uncle Lope de Mendoza, and\r\nDiego de Cabrera, alcayde of Dona Mencia, to alight and enter on foot\r\nin the battalion of infantry to animate them to the combat. He appointed\r\nalso the alcayde of Vaena and Diego de Clavijo, a cavalier of his\r\nhousehold, to remain in the rear, and not to permit any one to lag\r\nbehind, either to despoil the dead or for any other purpose.\r\n\r\nSuch were the orders given by this most adroit, active, and intrepid\r\ncavalier to his little army, supplying by admirable sagacity and subtle\r\nmanagement the want of a more numerous force. His orders being given\r\nand all arrangements made, he threw aside his lance, drew his sword, and\r\ncommanded his standard to be advanced against the enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF LUCENA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Moorish king had descried the Spanish forces at a distance, although\r\na slight fog prevented his seeing them distinctly and ascertaining their\r\nnumbers. His old father-in-law, Ali Atar, was by his side, who, being\r\na veteran marauder, was well acquainted with all the standards and\r\narmorial bearings of the frontiers. When the king beheld the ancient and\r\nlong-disused banner of Cabra emerging from the mist, he turned to Ali\r\nAtar and demanded whose ensign it was. The old borderer was for once at\r\na loss, for the banner had not been displayed in battle in his time.\r\n“In truth,” replied he, after a pause, “I have been considering that\r\nstandard for some time, but I confess I do not know it. It cannot be\r\nthe ensign of any single commander or community, for none would venture\r\nsingle-handed to attack you. It appears to be a dog, which device is\r\nborne by the towns of Baeza and Ubeda. If it be so, all Andalusia is in\r\nmovement against you, and I would advise you to retire.”\r\n\r\nThe count de Cabra, in winding down the hill toward the Moors, found\r\nhimself on much lower ground than the enemy: he ordered in all haste\r\nthat his standard should be taken back, so as to gain the\r\nvantage-ground. The Moors, mistaking this for a retreat, rushed\r\nimpetuously toward the Christians. The latter, having gained the height\r\nproposed, charged upon them at the same moment with the battle-cry of\r\n“Santiago!” and, dealing the first blows, laid many of the Moorish\r\ncavaliers in the dust.\r\n\r\nThe Moors, thus checked in their tumultuous assault, were thrown into\r\nconfusion, and began to give way, the Christians following hard upon\r\nthem. Boabdil el Chico endeavored to rally them. “Hold! hold! for\r\nshame!” cried he; “let us not fly, at least until we know our enemy.”\r\n The Moorish chivalry were stung by this reproof, and turned to make\r\nfront with the valor of men who feel that they are fighting under their\r\nmonarch’s eye.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, Lorenzo de Porres, alcayde of Luque, arrived with fifty\r\nhorse and one hundred foot, sounding an Italian trumpet from among a\r\ncopse of oak trees which concealed his force. The quick ear of old Ali\r\nAtar caught the note. “That is an Italian trumpet,” said he to the king;\r\n“the whole world seems in arms against Your Highness!”\r\n\r\nThe trumpet of Lorenzo de Porres was answered by that of the count de\r\nCabra in another direction, and it seemed to the Moors as if they were\r\nbetween two armies. Don Lorenzo, sallying from among the oaks, now\r\ncharged upon the enemy: the latter did not wait to ascertain the force\r\nof this new foe; the confusion, the variety of alarums, the attacks from\r\nopposite quarters, the obscurity of the fog, all conspired to deceive\r\nthem as to the number of their adversaries. Broken and dismayed, they\r\nretreated fighting, and nothing but the presence and remonstrances of\r\nthe king prevented their retreat from becoming a headlong flight. If\r\nBoabdil had displayed little of the talents of a general in the outset\r\nof his enterprise, he manifested courage and presence of mind amid\r\nthe disasters of its close. Seconded by a small body of cavalry, the\r\nchoicest and most loyal of his guards, he made repeated stand against\r\nthe press of the foe in a skirmishing retreat of about three leagues,\r\nand the way was strewn with the flower of his chivalry. At length they\r\ncame to the brook of Martin Gonzales (or Mingozales, as it is called by\r\nthe Moorish chroniclers), which, swollen by recent rain, was now a deep\r\nand turbid torrent. Here a scene of confusion ensued. Horse and foot\r\nprecipitated themselves into the stream. Some of the horses stuck\r\nfast in the mire and blocked up the ford; others trampled down the\r\nfoot-soldiers; many were drowned and more carried down the stream. Such\r\nof the foot-soldiers as gained the opposite side immediately took to\r\nflight; the horsemen, too, who had struggled through the stream, gave\r\nreins to their steeds and scoured for the frontier.\r\n\r\nThe little band of devoted cavaliers about the king serried their forces\r\nto keep the enemy in check, fighting with them hand to hand until he\r\nshould have time to cross. In the tumult his horse was shot down, and\r\nhe became environed in the throng of foot-soldiers struggling forward to\r\nthe ford and in peril from the lances of their pursuers. Conscious that\r\nhis rich array made him a conspicuous object, he retreated along the\r\nbank of the river, and endeavored to conceal himself in a thicket of\r\nwillows and tamarisks. Thence, looking back, he beheld his loyal band at\r\nlength give way, supposing, no doubt, he had effected his escape. They\r\ncrossed the ford, followed pell-mell by the enemy, and several of them\r\nwere struck down in the stream.\r\n\r\nWhile Boabdil was meditating to throw himself into the water and\r\nendeavor to swim across, he was discovered by Martin Hurtado, regidor of\r\nLucena, a brave cavalier who had been captive in the prisons of Granada\r\nand exchanged for a Christian knight. Hurtado attacked the king with\r\na pike, but was kept at bay until, seeing other soldiers approaching,\r\nBoabdil cried for quarter, proclaiming himself a person of high rank who\r\nwould pay a noble ransom. At this moment came up several men of Vaena,\r\nof the troop of the count de Cabra. Hearing the talk of ransom and\r\nnoticing the splendid attire of the Moor, they endeavored to secure for\r\nthemselves so rich a prize. One of them seized hold of Boabdil, but the\r\nlatter resented the indignity by striking him to the earth with a blow\r\nof his poniard. Others of Hurtado’s townsmen coming up, a contest\r\narose between the men of Lucena and Vaena as to who had a right to the\r\nprisoner. The noise brought Don Diego Fernandez de Cordova to the spot,\r\nwho by his authority put an end to the altercation. Boabdil, finding\r\nhimself unknown by all present, concealed his quality, giving himself\r\nout as the son of Aben Alnayer, a cavalier of the royal household.* Don\r\nDiego treated him with great courtesy, put a red band round his neck in\r\nsign of his being a captive, and sent him under an escort to the castle\r\nof Lucena where his quality would be ascertained, his ransom arranged,\r\nand the question settled as to who had made him prisoner.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Garibay, lib. 40, cap 31.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis done, the count put spurs to his horse and hastened to rejoin the\r\ncount de Cabra, who was in hot pursuit of the enemy. He overtook him\r\nat a stream called Reanaul, and they continued together to press on the\r\nskirts of the flying army during the remainder of the day. The pursuit\r\nwas almost as hazardous as the battle, for had the enemy at any time\r\nrecovered from their panic, they might, by a sudden reaction, have\r\noverwhelmed the small force of their pursuers. To guard against this\r\nperil, the wary count kept his battalion always in close order, and had\r\na body of a hundred chosen lancers in the advance. The Moors kept up a\r\nParthian retreat; several times they turned to make battle, but, seeing\r\nthis solid body of steeled warriors pressing upon them, they again took\r\nto flight.\r\n\r\nThe main retreat of the army was along the valley watered by the Xenil\r\nand opening through the mountains of Algaringo to the city of Loxa. The\r\nalarm-fires of the preceding night had aroused the country; every man\r\nsnatched sword and buckler from the wall, and the towns and villages\r\npoured forth their warriors to harass the retreating foe. Ali Atar kept\r\nthe main force of the army together, and turned fiercely from time to\r\ntime upon his pursuers: he was like a wolf hunted through the country he\r\nhad often made desolate by his maraudings.\r\n\r\nThe alarm of this invasion had reached the city of Antiquera, where\r\nwere several of the cavaliers who had escaped from the carnage in the\r\nmountains of Malaga. Their proud minds were festering with their late\r\ndisgrace, and their only prayer was for vengeance on the infidels. No\r\nsooner did they hear of the Moor being over the border than they were\r\narmed and mounted for action. Don Alonso de Aguilar led them forth--a\r\nsmall body of but forty horsemen, but all cavaliers of prowess and\r\nthirsting for revenge. They came upon the foe on the banks of the Xenil\r\nwhere it winds through the valleys of Cordova. The river, swelled by the\r\nlate rains, was deep and turbulent and only fordable at certain places.\r\nThe main body of the army was gathered in confusion on the banks,\r\nendeavoring to ford the stream, protected by the cavalry of Ali Atar.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did the little band of Alonso de Aguilar come in sight of\r\nthe Moors than fury flashed from their eyes. “Remember the mountains of\r\nMalaga!” cried they to each other as they rushed to combat. Their charge\r\nwas desperate, but was gallantly resisted. A scrambling and bloody fight\r\nensued, hand to hand and sword to sword, sometimes on land, sometimes\r\nin the water. Many were lanced on the banks; others, throwing themselves\r\ninto the river, sank with the weight of their armor and were drowned;\r\nsome, grappling together, fell from their horses, but continued their\r\nstruggle in the waves, and helm and turban rolled together down the\r\nstream. The Moors were far greater in number, and among them were\r\nmany warriors of rank; but they were disheartened by defeat, while the\r\nChristians were excited even to desperation.\r\n\r\nAli Atar alone preserved all his fire and energy amid his reverses. He\r\nhad been enraged at the defeat of the army and the ignominious flight he\r\nhad been obliged to make through a country which had so often been the\r\nscene of his exploits; but to be thus impeded in his flight and harassed\r\nand insulted by a mere handful of warriors roused the violent passions\r\nof the old Moor to perfect frenzy. He had marked Don Alonso de Aguilar\r\ndealing his blows (says Agapida) with the pious vehemence of a righteous\r\nknight, who knows that in every wound inflicted upon the infidels he\r\nis doing God service. Ali Atar spurred his steed along the bank of the\r\nriver to come upon Don Alonso by surprise. The back of the warrior was\r\ntoward him, and, collecting all his force, the Moor hurled his lance\r\nto transfix him on the spot. The lance was not thrown with the usual\r\naccuracy of Ali Atar: it tore away a part of the cuirass of Don Alonso,\r\nbut failed to inflict a wound. The Moor rushed upon Don Alonso with his\r\nscimetar, but the latter was on the alert and parried his blow. They\r\nfought desperately upon the borders of the river, alternately pressing\r\neach other into the stream and fighting their way again up the bank.\r\nAli Atar was repeatedly wounded, and Don Alonso, having pity on his age,\r\nwould have spared his life: he called upon him to surrender. “Never,”\r\n cried Ali Atar, “to a Christian dog!” The words were scarce out of his\r\nmouth when the sword of Don Alonso clove his turbaned head and sank deep\r\ninto the brain. He fell dead without a groan; his body rolled into the\r\nXenil, nor was it ever found or recognized.* Thus fell Ali Atar, who had\r\nlong been the terror of Andalusia. As he had hated and warred upon the\r\nChristians all his life, so he died in the very act of bitter hostility.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Cura de los Palacios.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fall of Ali Atar put an end to the transient stand of the cavalry.\r\nHorse and foot mingled together in the desperate struggle across the\r\nXenil, and many were trampled down and perished beneath the waves. Don\r\nAlonso and his band continued to harass them until they crossed the\r\nfrontier, and every blow struck home to the Moors seemed to lighten the\r\nload of humiliation and sorrow which had weighed heavy on their hearts.\r\n\r\nIn this disastrous rout the Moors lost upward of five thousand killed\r\nand made prisoners, many of whom were of the most noble lineages\r\nof Granada; numbers fled to rocks and mountains, where they were\r\nsubsequently taken.\r\n\r\nBoabdil remained a prisoner in the state tower of the citadel of Lucena\r\nunder the vigilance of Alonso de Rueda, esquire of the alcayde of the\r\nDonceles; his quality was still unknown until the 24th of April, three\r\ndays after the battle. On that day some prisoners, natives of Granada,\r\njust brought in, caught a sight of the unfortunate Boabdil despoiled of\r\nhis royal robes. Throwing themselves at his feet, they broke forth in\r\nloud lamentations, apostrophizing him as their lord and king.\r\n\r\nGreat was the astonishment and triumph of the count de Cabra and\r\nDon Diego Fernandez de Cordova on learning the rank of the supposed\r\ncavalier. They both ascended to the castle to see that he was lodged\r\nin a style befitting his quality. When the good count beheld in the\r\ndejected captive before him the monarch who had so recently appeared in\r\nroyal splendor surrounded by an army, his generous heart was touched by\r\nsympathy. He said everything to comfort him that became a courteous and\r\nChristian knight, observing that the same mutability of things which\r\nhad suddenly brought him low might as rapidly restore him to prosperity,\r\nsince in this world nothing is stable, and sorrow, like joy, has its\r\nallotted term.\r\n\r\nThe action here recorded was called by some the battle of Lucena,\r\nby others the battle of the Moorish king, because of the capture of\r\nBoabdil. Twenty-two banners, taken on the occasion, were borne in\r\ntriumph into Vaena on the 23d of April, St. George’s Day, and hung up in\r\nthe church. There they remain (says a historian of after times) to this\r\nday. Once a year, on the festival of St. George, they are borne about in\r\nprocession by the inhabitants, who at the same time give thanks to God\r\nfor this signal victory granted to their forefathers.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Several circumstances relative to the capture of Boabdil vary in\r\nthis from the first edition, in consequence of later light thrown on the\r\nsubject by Don Miguel Lafuente Alcantara in his History of Granada. He\r\nhas availed himself much of various ancient documents relative to the\r\nbattle, especially the History of the House of Cordova by the abbot of\r\nRute, a descendant of that family--a rare manuscript of which few copies\r\nexist.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question as to the person entitled to the honor and reward for\r\nhaving captured the king long continued a matter of dispute between\r\nthe people of Lucena and Vaena. On the 20th of October, 1520, about\r\nthirty-seven years after the event, an examination of several witnesses\r\nto the fact took place before the chief justice of the fortress of\r\nLucena, at the instance of Bartolomy Hurtado, the son of Martin, when\r\nthe claim of his father was established by Dona Leonora Hernandez, lady\r\nin attendant on the mother of the alcayde of los Donceles, who testified\r\nbeing present when Boabdil signalized Martin Hurtado as his captor.\r\n\r\nThe chief honor of the day, and of course of the defeat and capture of\r\nthe Moorish monarch, was given by the sovereign to the count de Cabra;\r\nthe second to his nephew, Don Diego Fernandez de Cordova.\r\n\r\nAmong the curious papers cited by Alcantara is one existing in the\r\narchives of the House of Medina Celi, giving the account of the\r\ntreasurer of Don Diego Fernandez as to the sums expended by his lord\r\nin the capture of the king, the reward given to some soldiers for a\r\nstandard of the king’s which they had taken, to others for the wounds\r\nthey had received, etc.\r\n\r\nAnother paper speaks of an auction at Lucena on the 28th of April\r\nof horses and mules taken in the battle. Another paper states the\r\ngratuities of the alcayde of los Donceles to the soldiery--four fanegas,\r\nor about four hundredweight, of wheat and a lance to each horseman, two\r\nfanegas of wheat and a lance to each foot-soldier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nLAMENTATIONS OF THE MOORS FOR THE BATTLE OF LUCENA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sentinels looked out from the watch-towers of Loxa along the valley\r\nof the Xenil, which passes through the mountains of Algaringo. They\r\nlooked to behold the king returning in triumph at the head of his\r\nshining host, laden with the spoil of the unbeliever. They looked to\r\nbehold the standard of their warlike idol, the fierce Ali Atar, borne by\r\nthe chivalry of Loxa, ever foremost in the wars of the border.\r\n\r\nIn the evening of the 21st of April they descried a single horseman\r\nurging his faltering steed along the banks of the Xenil. As he drew\r\nnear they perceived, by the flash of arms, that he was a warrior, and\r\non nearer approach by the richness of his armor and the caparison of his\r\nsteed they knew him to be a warrior of rank.\r\n\r\nHe reached Loxa faint and aghast, his courser covered with foam and dust\r\nand blood, panting and staggering with fatigue and gashed with wounds.\r\nHaving brought his master in safety, he sank down and died before the\r\ngate of the city. The soldiers at the gate gathered round the cavalier\r\nas he stood by his expiring steed: they knew him to be Cidi Caleb,\r\nnephew of the chief alfaqui of the mosque in the Albaycin, and their\r\nhearts were filled with fearful forebodings.\r\n\r\n“Cavalier,” said they, “how fares it with the king and army?”\r\n\r\nHe cast his hand mournfully toward the land of the Christians. “There\r\nthey lie!” exclaimed he. “The heavens have fallen upon them. All are\r\nlost! all dead!”*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Bernaldez (Cura de los Palacios), Hist. de los Reyes Catol.,\r\nMS., cap. 61.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon this there was a great cry of consternation among the people, and\r\nloud wailings of women, for the flower of the youth of Loxa were with\r\nthe army.\r\n\r\nAn old Moorish soldier, scarred in many a border battle, stood leaning\r\non his lance by the gateway. “Where is Ali Atar?” demanded he eagerly.\r\n“If he lives the army cannot be lost.”\r\n\r\n“I saw his helm cleft by the Christian sword; his body is floating in\r\nthe Xenil.”\r\n\r\nWhen the soldier heard these words he smote his breast and threw dust\r\nupon his head, for he was an old follower of Ali Atar.\r\n\r\nCidi Caleb gave himself no repose, but, mounting another steed, hastened\r\ntoward Granada. As he passed through the villages and hamlets he spread\r\nsorrow around, for their chosen men had followed the king to the wars.\r\n\r\nWhen he entered the gates of Granada and announced the loss of the king\r\nand army, a voice of horror went throughout the city. Every one thought\r\nbut of his own share in the general calamity, and crowded round the\r\nbearer of ill tidings. One asked after a father, another after a\r\nbrother, some after a lover, and many a mother after her son. His\r\nreplies all spoke of wounds and death. To one he replied, “I saw thy\r\nfather pierced with a lance as he defended the person of the king;” to\r\nanother, “Thy brother fell wounded under the hoofs of the horses, but\r\nthere was no time to aid him, for the Christian cavalry were upon\r\nus;” to another, “I saw the horse of thy lover covered with blood and\r\ngalloping without his rider;” to another, “Thy son fought by my side on\r\nthe banks of the Xenil: we were surrounded by the enemy and driven into\r\nthe stream. I heard him cry upon Allah in the midst of the waters: when\r\nI reached the other bank he was no longer by my side.”\r\n\r\nCidi Caleb passed on, leaving all Granada in lamentation: he urged\r\nhis steed up the steep avenue of trees and fountains that leads to the\r\nAlhambra, nor stopped until he arrived before the Gate of Justice. Ayxa,\r\nthe mother of Boabdil, and Morayma, his beloved and tender wife, had\r\ndaily watched from the Tower of Comares to behold his triumphant return.\r\nWho shall describe their affliction when they heard the tidings of Cidi\r\nCaleb? The sultana Ayxa spake not much, but sat as one entranced. Every\r\nnow and then a deep sigh burst forth, but she raised her eyes to heaven.\r\n“It is the will of Allah!” said she, and with these words endeavored\r\nto repress the agonies of a mother’s sorrow. The tender Morayma\r\nthrew herself on the earth and gave way to the full turbulence of her\r\nfeelings, bewailing her husband and her father. The high-minded Ayxa\r\nrebuked the violence of her grief. “Moderate these transports, my\r\ndaughter,” said she; “remember magnanimity should be the attribute\r\nof princes: it becomes not them to give way to clamorous sorrow, like\r\ncommon and vulgar minds.” But Morayma could only deplore her loss with\r\nthe anguish of a tender woman. She shut herself up in her mirador, and\r\ngazed all day with streaming eyes upon the Vega. Every object recalled\r\nthe causes of her affliction. The river Xenil, which ran shining amidst\r\ngroves and gardens, was the same on whose banks had perished her\r\nfather, Ali Atar; before her lay the road to Loxa, by which Boabdil had\r\ndeparted, in martial state, surrounded by the chivalry of Granada. Ever\r\nand anon she would burst into an agony of grief. “Alas! my father!” she\r\nwould exclaim; “the river runs smiling before me that covers thy mangled\r\nremains; who will gather them to an honored tomb in the land of the\r\nunbeliever? And thou, O Boabdil, light of my eyes! joy of my heart! life\r\nof my life! woe the day and woe the hour that I saw thee depart from\r\nthese walls! The road by which thou hast departed is solitary; never\r\nwill it be gladdened by thy return: the mountain thou hast traversed\r\nlies like a cloud in the distance, and all beyond is darkness.”\r\n\r\nThe royal minstrels were summoned to assuage her sorrows: they attuned\r\ntheir instruments to cheerful strains, but in a little while the anguish\r\nof their hearts prevailed and turned their songs to lamentations.\r\n\r\n“Beautiful Granada!” exclaimed they, “how is thy glory faded! The flower\r\nof thy chivalry lies low in the land of the stranger; no longer does the\r\nVivarrambla echo to the tramp of steed and sound of trumpet; no longer\r\nis it crowded with thy youthful nobles gloriously arrayed for the tilt\r\nand tourney. Beautiful Granada! the soft note of the lute no longer\r\nfloats through thy moonlit streets; the serenade is no more heard\r\nbeneath thy balconies; the lively castanet is silent upon thy hills;\r\nthe graceful dance of the Zambra is no more seen beneath thy bowers!\r\nBeautiful Granada! why is the Alhambra so lorn and desolate? The orange\r\nand myrtle still breathe their perfumes into its silken chambers; the\r\nnightingale still sings within its groves; its marble halls are still\r\nrefreshed with the plash of fountains and the gush of limpid rills.\r\nAlas! alas! the countenance of the king no longer shines within those\r\nhalls! The light of the Alhambra is set for ever!”\r\n\r\nThus all Granada, say the Arabian chroniclers, gave itself up to\r\nlamentation; there was nothing but the voice of wailing from the palace\r\nto the cottage. All joined to deplore their youthful monarch, cut\r\ndown in the freshness and promise of his youth; many feared that the\r\nprediction of the astrologers was about to be fulfilled, and that the\r\ndownfall of the kingdom would follow the death of Boabdil; while all\r\ndeclared that had he survived he was the very sovereign calculated to\r\nrestore the realm to its ancient prosperity and glory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nHOW MULEY ABUL HASSAN PROFITED BY THE MISFORTUNES OF HIS SON BOABDIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn unfortunate death atones, with the world, for a multitude of errors.\r\nWhile the populace thought their youthful monarch had perished in the\r\nfield nothing could exceed their grief for his loss and their adoration\r\nof his memory; when, however, they learnt that he was still alive\r\nand had surrendered himself captive to the Christians, their feelings\r\nunderwent an instant change. They decried his talents as a commander,\r\nhis courage as a soldier; they railed at his expedition as rash and\r\nill-conducted; and they reviled him for not having dared to die on the\r\nfield of battle, rather than surrender to the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe alfaquis, as usual, mingled with the populace and artfully guided\r\ntheir discontents. “Behold,” exclaimed they, “the prediction is\r\naccomplished which was pronounced at the birth of Boabdil! He has been\r\nseated on the throne, and the kingdom has suffered downfall and disgrace\r\nby his defeat and captivity. Comfort yourselves, O Moslems! The evil\r\nday has passed by; the prophecy is fulfilled: the sceptre which has been\r\nbroken in the feeble hand of Boabdil is destined to resume its former\r\nsway in the vigorous grasp of Abul Hassan.”\r\n\r\nThe people were struck with the wisdom of these words: they rejoiced\r\nthat the baleful prediction which had so long hung over them was at\r\nan end, and declared that none but Muley Abul Hassan had the valor and\r\ncapacity necessary for the protection of the kingdom in this time of\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nThe longer the captivity of Boabdil continued, the greater grew the\r\npopularity of his father. One city after another renewed allegiance to\r\nhim, for power attracts power and fortune creates fortune. At length he\r\nwas enabled to return to Granada and establish himself once more in\r\nthe Alhambra. At his approach his repudiated spouse, the sultana Ayxa,\r\ngathered together the family and treasures of her captive son, and\r\nretired, with a handful of the nobles, into the Albaycin, the rival\r\nquarter of the city, the inhabitants of which still retained feelings of\r\nloyalty to Boabdil. Here she fortified herself and held the semblance of\r\na court in the name of her son. The fierce Muley Abul Hassan would\r\nhave willingly carried fire and sword into this factious quarter of the\r\ncapital, but he dared not confide in his new and uncertain popularity.\r\nMany of the nobles detested him for his past cruelty, and a large\r\nportion of the soldiery, besides many of the people of his own party,\r\nrespected the virtues of Ayxa la Horra and pitied the misfortunes of\r\nBoabdil.\r\n\r\nGranada therefore presented the singular spectacle of two sovereignties\r\nwithin the same city. The old king fortified himself in the lofty\r\ntowers of the Alhambra, as much against his own subjects as against the\r\nChristians; while Ayxa, with the zeal of a mother’s affection, which\r\nwaxes warmer and warmer toward her offspring when in adversity,\r\nstill maintained the standard of Boabdil on the rival fortress of the\r\nAlcazaba, and kept his powerful faction alive within the walls of the\r\nAlbaycin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nCAPTIVITY OF BOABDIL EL CHICO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Boabdil remained a prisoner closely guarded, but treated\r\nwith great deference and respect, in the castle of Lucena, where the\r\nnoblest apartments were appointed for his abode. From the towers of his\r\nprison he beheld the town below filled with armed men, and the lofty\r\nhill on which it was built girdled by massive walls and ramparts, on\r\nwhich a vigilant watch was maintained night and day. The mountains\r\naround were studded with watch-towers overlooking the lonely roads which\r\nled to Granada, so that a turban could not stir over the border without\r\nthe alarm being given and the whole country put on the alert. Boabdil\r\nsaw that there was no hope of escape from such a fortress, and that any\r\nattempt to rescue him would be equally in vain. His heart was filled\r\nwith anxiety as he thought on the confusion and ruin which his captivity\r\nmust cause in his affairs, while sorrows of a softer kind overcame his\r\nfortitude as he thought on the evils it might bring upon his family.\r\n\r\nA few days only had passed away when missives arrived from the Castilian\r\nsovereigns. Ferdinand had been transported with joy at hearing of the\r\ncapture of the Moorish monarch, seeing the deep and politic uses that\r\nmight be made of such an event; but the magnanimous spirit of Isabella\r\nwas filled with compassion for the unfortunate captive. Their messages\r\nto Boabdil were full of sympathy and consolation, breathing that high\r\nand gentle courtesy which dwells in noble minds.\r\n\r\nThis magnanimity in his foe cheered the dejected spirit of the captive\r\nmonarch. “Tell my sovereigns, the king and queen,” said he to the\r\nmessenger, “that I cannot he unhappy being in the power of such high and\r\nmighty princes, especially since they partake so largely of that grace\r\nand goodness which Allah bestows upon the monarchs whom he greatly\r\nloves. Tell them, further, that I had long thought of submitting myself\r\nto their sway, to receive the kingdom of Granada from their hands in the\r\nsame manner that my ancestor received it from King John II., father to\r\nthe gracious queen. My greatest sorrow, in this my captivity, is that\r\nI must appear to do that from force which I would fain have done from\r\ninclination.”\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, Muley Abul Hassan, finding the faction of his son\r\nstill formidable in Granada, was anxious to consolidate his power by\r\ngaining possession of the person of Boabdil. For this purpose he sent an\r\nembassy to the Catholic monarchs, offering large terms for the ransom,\r\nor rather the purchase, of his son, proposing, among other conditions,\r\nto release the count of Cifuentes and nine other of his most\r\ndistinguished captives, and to enter into a treaty of confederacy with\r\nthe sovereigns. Neither did the implacable father make any scruple of\r\ntestifying his indifference whether his son were delivered up alive or\r\ndead, so that his person were placed assuredly within his power.\r\n\r\nThe humane heart of Isabella revolted at the idea of giving up the\r\nunfortunate prince into the hands of his most unnatural and inveterate\r\nenemy: a disdainful refusal was therefore returned to the old monarch,\r\nwhose message had been couched in a vaunting spirit. He was informed\r\nthat the Castilian sovereigns would listen to no proposals of peace from\r\nMuley Abul Hassan until he should lay down his arms and offer them in\r\nall humility.\r\n\r\nOvertures in a different spirit were made by the mother of Boabdil, the\r\nsultana Ayxa la Horra, with the concurrence of the party which still\r\nremained faithful to him. It was thereby proposed that Mahomet Abdallah,\r\notherwise called Boabdil, should hold his crown as vassal to the\r\nCastilian sovereigns, paying an annual tribute and releasing seventy\r\nChristian captives annually for five years; that he should, moreover,\r\npay a large sum upon the spot for his ransom, and at the same time give\r\nfreedom to four hundred Christians to be chosen by the king; that he\r\nshould also engage to be always ready to render military aid, and should\r\ncome to the Cortes, or assemblage of nobles and distinguished vassals\r\nof the Crown, whenever summoned. His only son and the sons of twelve\r\ndistinguished Moorish houses were to be delivered as hostages.\r\n\r\nAn embassy composed of the alcayde Aben Comixa, Muley, the royal\r\nstandard-bearer, and other distinguished cavaliers bore this proposition\r\nto the Spanish court at Cordova, where they were received by King\r\nFerdinand. Queen Isabella was absent at the time. He was anxious to\r\nconsult her in so momentous an affair, or, rather, he was fearful of\r\nproceeding too precipitately, and not drawing from this fortunate event\r\nall the advantage of which it was susceptible. Without returning any\r\nreply, therefore, to the mission, he ordered that the captive monarch\r\nshould be brought to Cordova.\r\n\r\nThe alcayde of the Donceles was the bearer of this mandate, and summoned\r\nall the hidalgos of Lucena and of his own estates to form an honorable\r\nescort for the illustrious prisoner. In this style he conducted him\r\nto the capital. The cavaliers and authorities of Cordova came forth to\r\nreceive the captive king with all due ceremony, and especial care was\r\ntaken to prevent any taunt or insult from the multitude, or anything\r\nthat might remind him of his humiliation. In this way he entered the\r\nonce proud capital of the Abda’rahmans, and was lodged in the house of\r\nthe king’s major-domo. Ferdinand, however, declined seeing the Moorish\r\nmonarch. He was still undetermined what course to pursue--whether to\r\nretain him prisoner, set him at liberty on ransom, or treat him with\r\npolitic magnanimity; and each course would require a different kind of\r\nreception. Until this point should be resolved, therefore, he gave\r\nhim in charge to Martin de Alarcon, alcayde of the ancient fortress of\r\nPorcuna, with orders to guard him strictly, but to treat him with\r\nthe distinction and deference due unto a prince. These commands were\r\nstrictly obeyed: he was escorted, as before, in royal state, to the\r\nfortress which was to form his prison, and, with the exception of being\r\nrestrained in his liberty, was as nobly entertained there as he could\r\nhave been in his regal palace at Granada.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, Ferdinand availed himself of this critical moment,\r\nwhile Granada was distracted with factions and dissensions, and before\r\nhe had concluded any treaty with Boabdil, to make a puissant and\r\nostentatious inroad into the very heart of the kingdom at the head of\r\nhis most illustrious nobles. He sacked and destroyed several towns and\r\ncastles, and extended his ravages to the very gates of Granada. Muley\r\nAbul Hassan did not venture to oppose him. His city was filled with\r\ntroops, but he was uncertain of their affection. He dreaded that should\r\nhe sally forth the gates of Granada might be closed against him by the\r\nfaction of the Albaycin.\r\n\r\nThe old Moor stood on the lofty tower of the Alhambra (says Antonio\r\nAgapida) grinding his teeth and foaming like a tiger shut up in his cage\r\nas he beheld the glittering battalions of the Christians wheeling about\r\nthe Vega, and the standard of the cross shining forth from among the\r\nsmoke of infidel villages and hamlets. The most Catholic king (continues\r\nAgapida) would gladly have continued this righteous ravage, but his\r\nmunitions began to fail. Satisfied, therefore, with having laid waste\r\nthe country of the enemy and insulted Muley Abul Hassan in his very\r\ncapital, he returned to Cordova covered with laurels and his army\r\nladen with spoils, and now bethought himself of coming to an immediate\r\ndecision in regard to his royal prisoner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nOF THE TREATMENT OF BOABDIL BY THE CASTILIAN SOVEREIGNS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA stately convention was held by King Ferdinand in the ancient city of\r\nCordova, composed of several of the most reverend prelates and renowned\r\ncavaliers of the kingdom, to determine upon the fate of the unfortunate\r\nBoabdil.\r\n\r\nDon Alonso de Cardenas, the worthy master of Santiago, was one of the\r\nfirst who gave his counsel. He was a pious and zealous knight, rigid\r\nin his devotion to the faith, and his holy zeal had been inflamed to\r\npeculiar vehemence since his disastrous crusade among the mountains of\r\nMalaga. He inveighed with ardor against any compromise or compact\r\nwith the infidels: the object of this war, he observed, was not the\r\nsubjection of the Moors, but their utter expulsion from the land,\r\nso that there might no longer remain a single stain of Mahometanism\r\nthroughout Christian Spain. He gave it as his opinion, therefore, that\r\nthe captive king ought not to be set at liberty.\r\n\r\nRoderigo Ponce de Leon, marques of Cadiz, on the contrary, spoke warmly\r\nfor the release of Boabdil. He pronounced it a measure of sound policy,\r\neven if done without conditions. It would tend to keep up the civil war\r\nin Granada, which was as a fire consuming the entrails of the enemy, and\r\neffecting more for the interests of Spain, without expense, than all the\r\nconquests of its arms.\r\n\r\nThe grand cardinal of Spain, Don Pedro Gonzalez de Mendoza, coincided\r\nin opinion with the marques of Cadiz. Nay (added that pious prelate and\r\npolitic statesman), it would be sound wisdom to furnish the Moor with\r\nmen and money and all other necessaries to promote the civil war in\r\nGranada: by this means would be produced great benefit to the service of\r\nGod, since we are assured by his infallible word that “a kingdom divided\r\nagainst itself cannot stand.” *\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Salazar, Cronica del Gran Cardinal, p. 188.\r\n\r\n\r\nFerdinand weighed these counsels in his mind, but was slow in coming to\r\na decision: he was religiously attentive to his own interests (observes\r\nFray Antonio Agapida), knowing himself to be but an instrument of\r\nProvidence in this holy war, and that, therefore, in consulting his own\r\nadvantage he was promoting the interests of the faith. The opinion\r\nof Queen Isabella relieved him from his perplexity. That high-minded\r\nprincess was zealous for the promotion of the faith, but not for the\r\nextermination of the infidels. The Moorish kings had held their thrones\r\nas vassals to her progenitors: she was content at present to accord\r\nthe same privilege, and that the royal prisoner should be liberated\r\non condition of becoming a vassal to the Crown. By this means might be\r\neffected the deliverance of many Christian captives who were languishing\r\nin Moorish chains.\r\n\r\nKing Ferdinand adopted the magnanimous measure recommended by the queen,\r\nbut he accompanied it with several shrewd conditions, exacting tribute,\r\nmilitary services, and safe passages and maintenance for Christian\r\ntroops throughout the places which should adhere to Boabdil. The captive\r\nking readily submitted to these stipulations, and swore, after the\r\nmanner of his faith, to observe them with exactitude. A truce was\r\narranged for two years, during which the Castilian sovereigns engaged\r\nto maintain him on his throne and to assist him in recovering all places\r\nwhich he had lost during his captivity.\r\n\r\nWhen Boabdil el Chico had solemnly agreed to this arrangement in the\r\ncastle of Porcuna, preparations were made to receive him in Cordova in\r\nregal style. Superb steeds richly caparisoned and raiments of brocade\r\nand silk and the most costly cloths, with all other articles of\r\nsumptuous array, were furnished to him and to fifty Moorish cavaliers\r\nwho had come to treat for his ransom, that he might appear in state\r\nbefitting the monarch of Granada and the most distinguished vassal of\r\nthe Castilian sovereigns. Money also was advanced to maintain him in\r\nsuitable grandeur during his residence at the Castilian court and his\r\nreturn to his dominions. Finally, it was ordered by the sovereigns that\r\nwhen he came to Cordova all the nobles and dignitaries of the court\r\nshould go forth to receive him.\r\n\r\nA question now arose among certain of those ancient and experienced\r\nmen who grow gray about a court in the profound study of forms and\r\nceremonials, with whom a point of punctilio is as a vast political\r\nright, and who contract a sublime and awful idea of the external dignity\r\nof the throne. Certain of these court sages propounded the momentous\r\nquestion whether the Moorish monarch, coming to do homage as a vassal,\r\nought not to kneel and kiss the hand of the king. This was immediately\r\ndecided in the affirmative by a large number of ancient cavaliers,\r\naccustomed (says Antonio Agapida) to the lofty punctilio of our most\r\ndignified court and transcendent sovereigns. The king, therefore, was\r\ninformed by those who arranged the ceremonials that when the Moorish\r\nmonarch appeared in his presence he was expected to extend his royal\r\nhand to receive the kiss of homage.\r\n\r\n“I should certainly do so,” replied King Ferdinand, “were he at liberty\r\nand in his own kingdom, but I certainly shall not do so, seeing that he\r\nis a prisoner and in mine.”\r\n\r\nThe courtiers loudly applauded the magnanimity of this reply, though\r\nmany condemned it in secret as savoring of too much generosity toward an\r\ninfidel; and the worthy Jesuit, Fray Antonio Agapida, fully concurs in\r\ntheir opinion.\r\n\r\nThe Moorish king entered Cordova with his little train of faithful\r\nknights and escorted by all the nobility and chivalry of the Castilian\r\ncourt. He was conducted with great state and ceremony to the royal\r\npalace. When he came in presence of Ferdinand he knelt and offered to\r\nkiss his hand, not merely in homage as his subject, but in gratitude for\r\nhis liberty. Ferdinand declined the token of vassalage, and raised him\r\ngraciously from the earth. An interpreter began, in the name of Boabdil,\r\nto laud the magnanimity of the Castilian monarch and to promise the\r\nmost implicit submission. “Enough!” said King Ferdinand, interrupting\r\nthe interpreter in the midst of his harangue: “there is no need of\r\nthese compliments. I trust in his integrity that he will do everything\r\nbecoming a good man and a good king.” With these words he received\r\nBoabdil el Chico into his royal friendship and protection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nRETURN OF BOABDIL FROM CAPTIVITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the month of August a noble Moor, of the race of the Abencerrages,\r\narrived with a splendid retinue at the city of Cordova, bringing with\r\nhim the son of Boabdil el Chico and other of the noble youth of Granada\r\nas hostages for the fulfilment of the terms of ransom. When the Moorish\r\nking beheld his son, his only child, who was to remain in his stead a\r\nsort of captive in a hostile land, he folded him in his arms and wept\r\nover him. “Woe the day that I was born!” exclaimed he, “and evil the\r\nstars that presided at my birth! Well was I called El Zogoybi, or the\r\nUnlucky, for sorrow is heaped upon me by my father, and sorrow do\r\nI transmit to my son!” The afflicted heart of Boabdil, however, was\r\nsoothed by the kindness of the Christian sovereigns, who received the\r\nhostage prince with a tenderness suited to his age and a distinction\r\nworthy of his rank. They delivered him in charge to the worthy alcayde\r\nMartin de Alarcon, who had treated his father with such courtesy during\r\nhis confinement in the castle of Porcuna, giving orders that after the\r\ndeparture of the latter his son should be entertained with great honor\r\nand princely attention in the same fortress.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of September a guard of honor assembled at the gate of the\r\nmansion of Boabdil to escort him to the frontiers of his kingdom. He\r\npressed his child to his heart at parting, but he uttered not a word,\r\nfor there were many Christian eyes to behold his emotion. He mounted his\r\nsteed, and never turned his head to look again upon the youth, but those\r\nwho were near him observed the vehement struggle that shook his frame,\r\nwherein the anguish of the father had wellnigh subdued the studied\r\nequanimity of the king.\r\n\r\nBoabdil el Chico and King Ferdinand sallied forth side by side from\r\nCordova, amidst the acclamations of a prodigious multitude. When they\r\nwere a short distance from the city they separated, with many gracious\r\nexpressions on the part of the Castilian monarch, and many thankful\r\nacknowledgments from his late captive, whose heart had been humbled by\r\nadversity. Ferdinand departed for Guadalupe, and Boabdil for Granada.\r\nThe latter was accompanied by a guard of honor, and the viceroys of\r\nAndalusia and the generals on the frontier were ordered to furnish him\r\nwith escorts and to show him all possible honor on his journey. In this\r\nway he was conducted in royal state through the country he had entered\r\nto ravage, and was placed in safety in his own dominions.\r\n\r\nHe was met on the frontier by the principal nobles and cavaliers of his\r\ncourt, who had been secretly sent by his mother, the sultana Ayxa, to\r\nescort him to the capital. The heart of Boabdil was lifted up for a\r\nmoment when he found himself on his own territories, surrounded by\r\nMoslem knights, with his own banners waving over his head, and he\r\nbegan to doubt the predictions of the astrologers: he soon found cause,\r\nhowever, to moderate his exultation. The royal train which had come to\r\nwelcome him was but scanty in number, and he missed many of his most\r\nzealous and obsequious courtiers. He had returned, indeed, to his\r\nkingdom, but it was no longer the devoted kingdom he had left. The story\r\nof his vassalage to the Christian sovereigns had been made use of by his\r\nfather to ruin him with the people. He had been represented as a traitor\r\nto his country, a renegado to his faith, and as leagued with the enemies\r\nof both to subdue the Moslems of Spain to the yoke of Christian bondage.\r\nIn this way the mind of the public had been turned from him; the greater\r\npart of the nobility had thronged round the throne of his father in the\r\nAlhambra; and his mother, the resolute sultana Ayxa, with difficulty\r\nmaintained her faction in the opposite towers of the Alcazaba.\r\n\r\nSuch was the melancholy picture of affairs given to Boabdil by the\r\ncourtiers who had come forth to meet him. They even informed him that it\r\nwould be an enterprise of difficulty and danger to make his way back to\r\nthe capital and regain the little court which still remained faithful\r\nto him in the heart of the city. The old tiger, Muley Abul Hassan, lay\r\ncouched within the Alhambra, and the walls and gates of the city were\r\nstrongly guarded by his troops. Boabdil shook his head at these tidings.\r\nHe called to mind the ill omen of his breaking his lance against the\r\ngate of Elvira when issuing forth so vaingloriously with his army, which\r\nhe now saw clearly had foreboded the destruction of that army on which\r\nhe had so confidently relied. “Henceforth,” said he, “let no man have\r\nthe impiety to scoff at omens.”\r\n\r\nBoabdil approached his capital by stealth and in the night, prowling\r\nabout its walls like an enemy seeking to destroy rather than a monarch\r\nreturning to his throne. At length he seized upon a postern-gate of the\r\nAlbaycin, that part of the city which had always been in his favor; he\r\npassed rapidly through the streets before the populace were aroused from\r\ntheir sleep, and reached in safety the fortress of the Alcazaba. Here he\r\nwas received into the embraces of his intrepid mother and his favorite\r\nwife Morayma. The transports of the latter on the safe return of her\r\nhusband were mingled with tears, for she thought of her father, Ali\r\nAtar, who had fallen in his cause, and of her only son, who was left a\r\nhostage in the hand of the Christians.\r\n\r\nThe heart of Boabdil, softened by his misfortunes, was moved by the\r\nchanges in everything round him; but his mother called up his spirit.\r\n“This,” said she, “is no time for tears and fondness. A king must think\r\nof his sceptre and his throne, and not yield to softness like common\r\nmen. Thou hast done well, my son, in throwing thyself resolutely into\r\nGranada: it must depend upon thyself whether thou remain here a king or\r\na captive.”\r\n\r\nThe old king, Muley Abul Hassan, had retired to his couch that night in\r\none of the strongest towers of the Alhambra, but his restless anxiety\r\nkept him from repose. In the first watch of the night he heard a\r\nshout faintly rising from the quarter of the Albaycin, which is on\r\nthe opposite side of the deep valley of the Darro. Shortly afterward\r\nhorsemen came galloping up the hill that leads to the main gate of the\r\nAlhambra, spreading the alarm that Boabdil had entered the city and\r\npossessed himself of the Alcazaba.\r\n\r\nIn the first transports of his rage the old king would have struck the\r\nmessenger to earth. He hastily summoned his counsellors and commanders,\r\nexhorting them to stand by him in this critical moment, and during the\r\nnight made every preparation to enter the Albaycin sword in hand in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the sultana Ayxa had taken prompt and vigorous measures\r\nto strengthen her party. The Albaycin was the part of the city filled\r\nby the lower orders. The return of Boabdil was proclaimed throughout the\r\nstreets, and large sums of money were distributed among the populace.\r\nThe nobles assembled in the Alcazaba were promised honors and rewards\r\nby Boabdil as soon as he should be firmly seated on the throne. These\r\nwell-timed measures had the customary effect, and by daybreak all the\r\nmotley populace of the Albaycin were in arms.\r\n\r\nA doleful day succeeded. All Granada was a scene of tumult and\r\nhorror. Drums and trumpets resounded in every part; all business was\r\ninterrupted; the shops were shut, the doors barricadoed. Armed bands\r\nparaded the streets, some shouting for Boabdil, and some for Muley\r\nAbul Hassan. When they encountered each other they fought furiously and\r\nwithout mercy; every public square became a scene of battle. The great\r\nmass of the lower orders was in favor of Boabdil, but it was a multitude\r\nwithout discipline or lofty spirit: part of the people were regularly\r\narmed, but the greater number had sallied forth with the implements of\r\ntheir trade. The troops of the old king, among whom were many cavaliers\r\nof pride and valor, soon drove the populace from the squares. They\r\nfortified themselves, however, in the streets and lanes, which\r\nthey barricadoed. They made fortresses of their houses, and fought\r\ndesperately from the windows and the roofs, and many a warrior of the\r\nhighest blood of Granada was laid low by plebeian hands and plebeian\r\nweapons in this civic brawl.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Conde, Domin. de los Arabes, p. 4, c. 37.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was impossible that such violent convulsions should last long in the\r\nheart of the city. The people soon longed for repose and a return to\r\ntheir peaceful occupations, and the cavaliers detested these conflicts\r\nwith the multitude, in which were all the horrors of war without its\r\nlaurels. By the interference of the alfaquis an armistice was at length\r\neffected. Boabdil was persuaded that there was no dependence upon the\r\ninconstant favor of the multitude, and was prevailed upon to quit a\r\ncapital where he could only maintain a precarious seat upon his throne\r\nby a perpetual and bloody struggle. He fixed his court at the city of\r\nAlmeria, which was entirely devoted to him, and which at that time vied\r\nwith Granada in splendor and importance. This compromise of grandeur\r\nfor tranquillity, however, was sorely against the counsels of his\r\nproud-spirited mother, the sultana Ayxa. Granada appeared, in her eyes,\r\nthe only legitimate seat of dominion, and she observed, with a smile of\r\ndisdain, that he was not worthy of being called a monarch who was not\r\nmaster of his capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nFORAY OF THE MOORISH ALCAYDES, AND BATTLE OF LOPERA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough Muley Abul Hassan had regained undivided sway over the city of\r\nGranada, and the alfaquis, by his command, had denounced his son Boabdil\r\nas an apostate doomed by Heaven to misfortune, still the latter had many\r\nadherents among the common people. Whenever, therefore, any act of the\r\nold monarch was displeasing to the turbulent multitude, they were prone\r\nto give him a hint of the slippery nature of his standing by shouting\r\nout the name of Boabdil el Chico. Long experience had instructed Muley\r\nAbul Hassan in the character of the inconstant people over whom he\r\nruled. “A successful inroad into the country of the unbelievers,” said\r\nhe, “will make more converts to my cause than a thousand texts of the\r\nKoran expounded by ten thousand alfaquis.”\r\n\r\nAt this time King Ferdinand was absent from Andalusia on a distant\r\nexpedition with many of his troops. The moment was favorable for a\r\nforay, and Muley Abul Hassan cast about his thoughts for a leader\r\nto conduct it. Ali Atar, the terror of the border, the scourge of\r\nAndalusia, was dead, but there was another veteran general, scarce\r\ninferior to him for predatory warfare. This was old Bexir, the gray and\r\ncrafty alcayde of Malaga, and the people under his command were ripe\r\nfor an expedition of the kind. The signal defeat and slaughter of the\r\nSpanish knights in the neighboring mountains had filled the people of\r\nMalaga with vanity and self-conceit. They had attributed to their own\r\nvalor the defeat caused by the nature of the country. Many of them\r\nwore the armor and paraded in public with the horses of the unfortunate\r\ncavaliers slain on that occasion, vauntingly displaying them as trophies\r\nof their boasted victory. They had talked themselves into a contempt\r\nfor the chivalry of Andalusia, and were impatient for an opportunity\r\nto overrun a country defended by such troops. This Muley Abul Hassan\r\nconsidered a favorable state of mind for a daring inroad, and sent\r\norders to old Bexir to gather together the choicest warriors of the\r\nborders and carry fire and sword into the very heart of Andalusia. Bexir\r\nimmediately despatched his emissaries among the alcaydes of the border\r\ntowns, calling upon them to assemble with their troops at the city of\r\nRonda.\r\n\r\nRonda was the most virulent nest of Moorish depredators in the whole\r\nborder country. It was situated in the midst of the wild Serrania, or\r\nchain of mountains of the same name, which are uncommonly lofty, broken,\r\nand precipitous. It stood on an almost isolated rock, nearly encircled\r\nby a deep valley, or rather chasm, through which ran the beautiful river\r\ncalled Rio Verde. The Moors of this city were the most active, robust,\r\nand warlike of all the mountaineers, and their very children discharged\r\nthe crossbow with unerring aim. They were incessantly harassing the rich\r\nplains of Andalusia; their city abounded with Christian captives, who\r\nmight sigh in vain for deliverance from this impregnable fortress. Such\r\nwas Ronda in the time of the Moors, and it has ever retained something\r\nof the same character, even to the present day. Its inhabitants\r\ncontinue to be among the boldest, fiercest, and most adventurous of the\r\nAndalusian mountaineers, and the Serrania de Ronda is famous as the most\r\ndangerous resort of the bandit and the contrabandista.\r\n\r\nHamet Zeli, surnamed El Zegri, was the commander of this belligerent\r\ncity and its fierce inhabitants. He was of the tribe of the Zegries,\r\nand one of the most proud and daring of that warlike race. Besides\r\nthe inhabitants of Ronda and some of his own tribe, he had a legion of\r\nAfrican Moors in his immediate service. They were of the tribe of the\r\nGomeres, so called from their native mountains--mercenary troops whose\r\nhot African blood had not yet been tempered by the softer living of\r\nSpain, and whose whole business was to fight. These he kept always well\r\narmed and well appointed. The rich pasturage of the valley of Ronda\r\nproduced a breed of horses famous for strength and speed; no cavalry,\r\ntherefore, was better mounted than the band of Gomeres. Rapid on the\r\nmarch, fierce in the attack, it would sweep down upon the Andalusian\r\nplains like a sudden blast from the mountains, and pass away as suddenly\r\nbefore there was time for pursuit.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing that stirred up the spirit of the Moors of the\r\nfrontiers more thoroughly than the idea of a foray. The summons of Bexir\r\nwas gladly obeyed by the alcaydes of the border towns, and in a little\r\nwhile there was a force of fifteen hundred horse and four thousand foot,\r\nthe very pith and marrow of the surrounding country, assembled within\r\nthe walls of Ronda. The people of the place anticipated with eagerness\r\nthe rich spoils of Andalusia soon to crowd their gates; throughout the\r\nday the city resounded with the noise of kettle-drum and trumpet; the\r\nhigh-mettled steeds stamped and neighed in their stalls as if they\r\nshared the impatience for the foray; while the Christian captives sighed\r\nas the varied din of preparation reached their rocky dungeons, denoting\r\na fresh expedition against their countrymen.\r\n\r\nThe infidel host sallied forth full of spirits, anticipating an easy\r\nravage and abundant booty. They encouraged each other in a contempt for\r\nthe prowess of the foe. Many of the warriors of Malaga and of some of\r\nthe mountain-towns had insultingly arrayed themselves in the splendid\r\narmor of the Christian knights slain or taken prisoners in the famous\r\nmassacre, and some of them rode the Andalusian steeds captured on that\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nThe wary Bexir concerted his plans so secretly and expeditiously that\r\nthe Christian towns of Andalusia had not the least suspicion of the\r\nstorm gathering beyond the mountains. The vast rocky range of the\r\nSerrania de Ronda extended like a screen, covering all their movements\r\nfrom observation.\r\n\r\nThe army made its way as rapidly as the rugged nature of the mountains\r\nwould permit, guided by Hamet el Zegri, the bold alcayde of Ronda, who\r\nknew every pass and defile: not a drum nor the clash of a cymbal nor\r\nthe blast of a trumpet was permitted to be heard. The mass of war\r\nrolled quietly on as the gathering cloud to the brow of the mountains,\r\nintending to burst down like the thunderbolt upon the plain.\r\n\r\nNever let the most wary commander fancy himself secure from discovery,\r\nfor rocks have eyes, and trees have ears, and the birds of the air have\r\ntongues, to betray the most secret enterprise. There chanced at this\r\ntime to be six Christian scouts prowling about the savage heights of the\r\nSerrania de Ronda. They were of that kind of lawless ruffians who infest\r\nthe borders of belligerent countries, ready at any time to fight for\r\npay or prowl for plunder. The wild mountain-passes of Spain have ever\r\nabounded with loose rambling vagabonds of the kind--soldiers in war,\r\nrobbers in peace, guides, guards, smugglers, or cutthroats according to\r\nthe circumstances of the case.\r\n\r\nThese six marauders (says Fray Antonio Agapida) were on this occasion\r\nchosen instruments, sanctified by the righteousness of their cause. They\r\nwere lurking among the mountains to entrap Moorish cattle or Moorish\r\nprisoners, both of which were equally salable in the Christian market.\r\nThey had ascended one of the loftiest cliffs, and were looking out like\r\nbirds of prey, ready to pounce upon anything that might offer in\r\nthe valley, when they descried the Moorish army emerging from a\r\nmountain-glen. They watched it as it wound below them, remarking the\r\nstandards of the various towns and the pennons of the commanders. They\r\nhovered about it on its march, skulking from cliff to cliff, until they\r\nsaw the route by which it intended to enter the Christian country.\r\nThey then dispersed, each making his way by the secret passes of the\r\nmountains to some different alcayde, that they might spread the alarm\r\nfar and wide, and each get a separate reward.\r\n\r\nOne hastened to Luis Fernandez Puerto Carrero, the same valiant alcayde\r\nwho had repulsed Muley Abul Hassan from the walls of Alhama, and who\r\nnow commanded at Ecija in the absence of the master of Santiago. Others\r\nroused the town of Utrera and the places of that neighborhood, putting\r\nthem all on the alert.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Pulgar, p. 3, c. 24; Cura de los Palacios, cap. 67.\r\n\r\n\r\nPuerto Carrero was a cavalier of consummate vigor and activity. He\r\nimmediately sent couriers to the alcaydes of the neighboring fortresses,\r\nto Herman Carrello, captain of a body of the Holy Brotherhood, and to\r\ncertain knights of the order of Alcantara. Puerto Carrero was the first\r\nto take the field. Knowing the hard and hungry service of these border\r\nscampers, he made every man take a hearty repast and see that his horse\r\nwas well shod and perfectly appointed. Then, all being refreshed and in\r\nvaliant heart, he sallied forth to seek the Moors. He had but a handful\r\nof men, the retainers of his household and troops of his captaincy, but\r\nthey were well armed and mounted, and accustomed to the sudden rouses\r\nof the border--men whom the cry of “Arm and out! to horse and to the\r\nfield!” was sufficient at any time to put in a fever of animation.\r\n\r\nWhile the northern part of Andalusia was thus on the alert, one of the\r\nscouts had hastened southward to the city of Xeres, and given the alarm\r\nto the valiant marques of Cadiz. When the marques heard that the Moor\r\nwas over the border and that the standard of Malaga was in the advance,\r\nhis heart bounded with a momentary joy, for he remembered the massacre\r\nin the mountains, where his valiant brothers had been mangled before\r\nhis eyes. The very authors of his calamity were now at hand, and he\r\nflattered himself that the day of vengeance had arrived. He made a hasty\r\nlevy of his retainers and of the fighting men of Xeres, and hurried\r\noff with three hundred horse and two hundred foot, all resolute men and\r\npanting for revenge.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the veteran Bexir had accomplished his march, as\r\nhe imagined, undiscovered. From the openings of the craggy defiles he\r\npointed out the fertile plains of Andalusia, and regaled the eyes of\r\nhis soldiery with the rich country they were about to ravage. The fierce\r\nGomeres of Ronda were flushed with joy at the sight, and even their\r\nsteeds seemed to prick up their ears and snuff the breeze as they beheld\r\nthe scenes of their frequent forays.\r\n\r\nWhen they came to where the mountain-defile opened into the low land,\r\nBexir divided his force into three parts: one, composed of foot-soldiers\r\nand such as were weakly mounted, he left to guard the pass, being too\r\nexperienced a veteran not to know the importance of securing a retreat;\r\na second body he placed in ambush among the groves and thickets on the\r\nbanks of the river Lopera; the third, consisting of light cavalry, he\r\nsent forth to ravage the Campina (or great plain) of Utrera. Most of\r\nthis latter force was composed of the Gomeres of Ronda, mounted on the\r\nfleet steeds bred among the mountains. It was led by Hamet el Zegri,\r\never eager to be foremost in the forage. Little suspecting that the\r\ncountry on both sides was on the alarm, and rushing from all directions\r\nto close upon them in the rear, this fiery troop dashed forward until\r\nthey came within two leagues of Utrera. Here they scattered themselves\r\nabout the plain, careering round the great herds of cattle and flocks of\r\nsheep, and sweeping them into droves to be hurried to the mountains.\r\n\r\nWhile thus dispersed a troop of horse and body of foot from Utrera came\r\nsuddenly upon them. The Moors rallied together in small parties and\r\nendeavored to defend themselves; but they were without a leader, for\r\nHamet el Zegri was at a distance, having, like a hawk, made a wide\r\ncircuit in pursuit of prey. The marauders soon gave way and fled toward\r\nthe ambush on the banks of the Lopera, being hotly pursued by the men of\r\nUtrera.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the Lopera the Moors in ambush rushed forth with\r\nfurious cries, and the fugitives, recovering courage from this\r\nreinforcement, rallied and turned upon their pursuers. The Christians\r\nstood their ground, though greatly inferior in number. Their lances were\r\nsoon broken, and they came to sharp work with sword and scimetar. The\r\nChristians fought valiantly, but were in danger of being overwhelmed.\r\nThe bold Hamet collected a handful of his scattered Gomeres, left his\r\nprey, and galloped toward the scene of action. His little troop of\r\nhorsemen had reached the crest of a rising ground at no great distance\r\nwhen trumpets were heard in another direction, and Luis Fernandez Puerto\r\nCarrero and his followers came galloping into the field, and charged\r\nupon the infidels in flank.\r\n\r\nThe Moors were astounded at finding war thus breaking upon them from\r\nvarious quarters of what they had expected to find an unguarded country.\r\nThey fought for a short time with desperation, and resisted a vehement\r\nassault from the knights of Alcantara and the men-at-arms of the Holy\r\nBrotherhood. At length the veteran Bexir was struck from his horse by\r\nPuerto Carrero and taken prisoner, and the whole force gave way\r\nand fled. In their flight they separated and took two roads to the\r\nmountains, thinking by dividing their forces to distract the enemy. The\r\nChristians were too few to separate. Puerto Carrero kept them together,\r\npursuing one division of the enemy with great slaughter. This battle\r\ntook place at the fountain of the fig tree, near to the Lopera. Six\r\nhundred Moorish cavaliers were slain and many taken prisoners. Much\r\nspoil was collected on the field, with which the Christians returned in\r\ntriumph to their homes.\r\n\r\nThe larger body of the enemy had retreated along a road leading more to\r\nthe south, by the banks of the Guadalete. When they reached that river\r\nthe sound of pursuit had died away, and they rallied to breathe and\r\nrefresh themselves on the margin of the stream. Their force was reduced\r\nto about a thousand horse and a confused multitude of foot. While they\r\nwere scattered and partly dismounted on the banks of the Guadalete a\r\nfresh storm of war burst upon them from an opposite direction. It was\r\nthe (4) marques of Cadiz, leading on his household troops and the fighting\r\nmen of Xeres. When the Christian warriors came in sight of the Moors,\r\nthey were roused to fury at beholding many of them arrayed in the armor\r\nof the cavaliers who had been slain among the mountains of Malaga. Nay,\r\nsome who had been in that defeat beheld their own armor, which they had\r\ncast away in their flight to enable themselves to climb the mountains.\r\nExasperated at the sight they rushed upon the foe with the ferocity of\r\ntigers rather than the temperate courage of cavaliers. Each man felt\r\nas if he were avenging the death of a relative or wiping out his own\r\ndisgrace. The good marques himself beheld a powerful Moor bestriding the\r\nhorse of his brother Beltran: giving a cry of rage and anguish at the\r\nsight, he rushed through the thickest of the enemy, attacked the Moor\r\nwith resistless fury, and after a short combat hurled him breathless to\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nThe Moors, already vanquished in spirit, could not withstand the assault\r\nof men thus madly excited. They soon gave way, and fled for the defile\r\nof the Serrania de Ronda, where the body of troops had been stationed\r\nto secure a retreat. These, seeing them come galloping wildly up the\r\ndefile, with Christian banners in pursuit and the flash of weapons at\r\ntheir deadly work, thought all Andalusia was upon them, and fled without\r\nawaiting an attack. The pursuit continued among glens and defiles, for\r\nthe Christian warriors, eager for revenge, had no compassion on the foe.\r\n\r\nWhen the pursuit was over the marques of Cadiz and his followers reposed\r\nthemselves upon the banks of the Guadalete, where they divided the\r\nspoil. Among this were found many rich corselets, helmets, and weapons,\r\nthe Moorish trophies of the defeat in the mountains of Malaga. Several\r\nwere claimed by their owners; others were known to have belonged to\r\nnoble cavaliers who had been slain or taken prisoners. There were\r\nseveral horses also, richly caparisoned, which had pranced proudly with\r\nthe unfortunate warriors as they sallied out of Antiquera upon that\r\nfatal expedition. Thus the exultation of the victors was dashed with\r\nmelancholy, and many a knight was seen lamenting over the helmet or\r\ncorselet of some loved companion-in-arms.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.--“En el despojo de la Batalla se vieron muchas ricas corazas e\r\ncapacetes, e barberas de las que se habian perdido en el Axarquia, e\r\notras muchas armas, e algunes fueron conocidas de sus duenos que las\r\nhabian dejado por fuir, e otras fueron conocidas, que eran mui senaladas\r\nde hombres principales que habian quedado muertos e cautivos, i fueron\r\ntornados muchos de los mismos Caballos con sus ricas sillas, de los que\r\nquedaron en la Axerquia, e fueron concidos cuios eran.”--“Cura de los\r\nPalacios,” cap. 67.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nRETREAT OF HAMET EL ZEGRI, ALCAYDE OF RONDA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bold alcayde of Ronda, Hamet el Zegri, had careered wide over the\r\nCampina of Utrera, encompassing the flocks and herds, when he heard the\r\nburst of war at a distance. There were with him but a handful of\r\nhis Gomeres. He saw the scamper and pursuit afar off, and beheld the\r\nChristian horsemen spurring madly toward the ambuscade on the banks\r\nof the Lopera. Hamet tossed his hand triumphantly aloft for his men to\r\nfollow him. “The Christian dogs are ours!” said he as he put spurs to\r\nhis horse to take the enemy in rear.\r\n\r\nThe little band which followed Hamet scarcely amounted to thirty\r\nhorsemen. They spurred across the plain, and reached a rising ground\r\njust as the force of Puerto Carrero had charged, with sound of trumpet,\r\nupon the flank of the party in ambush. Hamet beheld the headlong rout of\r\nthe army with rage and consternation. He found the country was pouring\r\nforth its legions from every quarter, and perceived that there was no\r\nsafety but in precipitate flight.\r\n\r\nBut which way to fly? An army was between him and the mountain-pass; all\r\nthe forces of the neighborhood were rushing to the borders; the whole\r\nroute by which he had come was by this time occupied by the foe.\r\nHe checked his steed, rose in the stirrups, and rolled a stern and\r\nthoughtful eye over the country; then, sinking into his saddle, he\r\nseemed to commune a moment with himself. Turning quickly to his troop,\r\nhe singled out a renegado Christian, a traitor to his religion and his\r\nking. “Come hither,” said Hamet. “Thou knowest all the secret passes\r\nof the country?”--“I do,” replied the renegado.--“Dost thou know any\r\ncircuitous route, solitary and untravelled, by which we can pass wide\r\nwithin these troops and reach the Serrania?”--The renegado paused: “Such\r\na route I know, but it is full of peril, for it leads through the heart\r\nof the Christian land.”--“‘Tis well,” said Hamet; “the more dangerous in\r\nappearance, the less it will be suspected. Now hearken to me. Ride by my\r\nside. Thou seest this purse of gold and this scimetar. Take us, by the\r\nroute thou hast mentioned, safe to the pass of the Serrania, and this\r\npurse shall be thy reward; betray us, and this scimetar shall cleave\r\nthee to the saddle-bow.” *\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Cura de los Palacios, ubi sup.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe renegado obeyed, trembling. They turned off from the direct road to\r\nthe mountains and struck southward toward Lebrixa, passing by the most\r\nsolitary roads and along those deep ramblas and ravines by which the\r\ncountry is intersected. It was indeed a daring course. Every now and\r\nthen they heard the distant sound of trumpets and the alarm-bells of\r\ntowns and villages, and found that the war was still hurrying to the\r\nborders. They hid themselves in thickets and in dry beds of rivers until\r\nthe danger had passed by, and then resumed their course. Hamet el Zegri\r\nrode on in silence, his hand upon his scimetar and his eye upon\r\nthe renegado guide, prepared to sacrifice him on the least sign of\r\ntreachery, while his band followed, gnawing their lips with rage at\r\nhaving thus to skulk through a country they had come to ravage.\r\n\r\nWhen night fell they struck into more practicable roads, always keeping\r\nwide of the villages and hamlets, lest the watch-dogs should betray\r\nthem. In this way they passed in deep midnight by Arcos, crossed the\r\nGuadalete, and effected their retreat to the mountains. The day dawned\r\nas they made their way up the savage defiles. Their comrades had been\r\nhunted up these very glens by the enemy. Every now and then they came\r\nto where there had been a partial fight or a slaughter of the fugitives,\r\nand the rocks were red with blood and strewed with mangled bodies. The\r\nalcayde of Ronda was almost frantic with rage at seeing many of his\r\nbravest warriors lying stiff and stark, a prey to the hawks and vultures\r\nof the mountains. Now and then some wretched Moor would crawl out of a\r\ncave or glen, whither he had fled for refuge, for in the retreat many\r\nof the horsemen had abandoned their steeds, thrown away their armor,\r\nand clambered up the cliffs, where they could not be pursued by the\r\nChristian cavalry.\r\n\r\nThe Moorish army had sallied forth from Ronda amidst shouts and\r\nacclamations, but wailings were heard within its walls as the alcayde\r\nand his broken band returned without banner or trumpet and haggard with\r\nfamine and fatigue. The tidings of their disaster had preceded them,\r\nborne by the fugitives of the army. No one ventured to speak to the\r\nstern Hamet as he entered the city, for they saw a dark cloud upon his\r\nbrow.\r\n\r\nIt seemed (says the pious Antonio Agapida) as if Heaven meted out this\r\ndefeat in exact retribution for the ills inflicted upon the Christian\r\nwarriors in the heights of Malaga. It was equally signal and disastrous.\r\nOf the brilliant array of Moorish chivalry which had descended so\r\nconfidently into Andalusia, not more than two hundred escaped. The\r\nchoicest troops of the frontier were either taken or destroyed, the\r\nMoorish garrisons enfeebled, and many alcaydes and cavaliers of noble\r\nlineage carried into captivity, who were afterward obliged to redeem\r\nthemselves with heavy ransoms.\r\n\r\nThis was called the battle of Lopera, and was fought on the 17th of\r\nSeptember, 1483. Ferdinand and Isabella were at Vittoria in Old Castile\r\nwhen they received news of the victory and the standards taken from the\r\nenemy. They celebrated the event with processions, illuminations, and\r\nother festivities. Ferdinand sent to the marques of Cadiz the royal\r\nraiment which he had worn on that day, and conferred on him and all\r\nthose who should inherit his title the privilege of wearing royal robes\r\non our Lady’s Day in September in commemoration of this victory.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Mariana, Abarca, Zurita, Pulgar, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nQueen Isabella was equally mindful of the great services of Don Luis\r\nFernandez Puerto Carrero. Besides many encomiums and favors, she sent to\r\nhis wife the royal vestments and robe of brocade which she had worn on\r\nthe same day, to be worn by her during her life on the anniversary of\r\nthat battle.*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nOF THE RECEPTION AT COURT OF THE COUNT DE CABRA AND THE ALCAYDE DE LOS\r\nDONCELES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the bustle of warlike affairs the worthy chronicler Fray\r\nAntonio Agapida pauses to note, with curious accuracy, the distinguished\r\nreception given to the count de Cabra and his nephew, the alcayde de\r\nlos Donceles, at the stately and ceremonious court of the Castilian\r\nsovereigns, in reward for the capture of the Moorish king Boabdil. The\r\ncourt (he observes) was held at the time in the ancient Moorish palace\r\nof the city of Cordova, and the ceremonials were arranged by that\r\nvenerable prelate Don Pedro Gonzales de Mendoza, bishop of Toledo and\r\ngrand cardinal of Spain.\r\n\r\nIt was on Wednesday, the 14th of October (continues the precise Antonio\r\nAgapida), that the good count de Cabra, according to arrangement,\r\nappeared at the gate of Cordova. Here he was met by the grand cardinal\r\nand the duke of Villahermosa, illegitimate brother of the king, together\r\nwith many of the first grandees and prelates of the kingdom. By this\r\naugust train was he attended to the palace amidst strains of martial\r\nmusic and the shouts of a prodigious multitude.\r\n\r\nWhen the count arrived in the presence of the sovereigns, who were\r\nseated in state on a dais or raised part of the hall of audience, they\r\nboth arose. The king advanced exactly five steps toward the count, who\r\nknelt and kissed his royal hand; however, the king would not receive\r\nhim as a mere vassal, but embraced him with affectionate cordiality. The\r\nqueen also advanced two steps, and received the count with a countenance\r\nfull of sweetness and benignity: after he had kissed her hand the king\r\nand queen returned to their thrones, and, cushions being brought, they\r\nordered the count de Cabra to be seated in their presence. This last\r\ncircumstance is written in large letters and followed by several notes\r\nof admiration in the manuscript of the worthy Fray Antonio Agapida,\r\nwho considers the extraordinary privilege of sitting in presence of the\r\nCatholic sovereigns an honor well worth fighting for.\r\n\r\nThe good count took his seat at a short distance from the king, and near\r\nhim was seated the duke of Najera, then the bishop of Palencia, then the\r\ncount of Aguilar, the count Luna, and Don Gutierre de Cardenas, senior\r\ncommander of Leon.\r\n\r\nOn the side of the queen were seated the grand cardinal of Spain, the\r\nduke of Villahermosa, the count of Monte Rey, and the bishops of Jaen\r\nand Cuenca, each in the order in which they are named. The infanta\r\nIsabella was prevented by indisposition from attending the ceremony.\r\n\r\nAnd now festive music resounded through the hall, and twenty ladies of\r\nthe queen’s retinue entered, magnificently attired; upon which twenty\r\nyouthful cavaliers, very gay and galliard in their array, stepped forth,\r\nand, each seeking his fair partner, they commenced a stately dance. The\r\ncourt in the mean time (observes Fray Antonio Agapida) looked on with\r\nlofty and becoming gravity.\r\n\r\nWhen the dance was concluded the king and queen rose to retire to\r\nsupper, and dismissed the count with many gracious expressions. He was\r\nthen attended by all the grandees present to the palace of the grand\r\ncardinal, where they partook of a sumptuous banquet.\r\n\r\nOn the following Saturday the alcayde de los Donceles was received\r\nlikewise with great honors, but the ceremonies were so arranged as to be\r\na degree less in dignity than those shown to his uncle, the latter being\r\nconsidered the principal actor in this great achievement. Thus the grand\r\ncardinal and the duke of Villahermosa did not meet him at the gate\r\nof the city, but received him in the palace and entertained him in\r\nconversation until summoned to the sovereigns. # When the alcayde de los\r\nDonceles entered the presence-chamber the king and queen rose from\r\ntheir chairs, but without advancing. They greeted him graciously, and\r\ncommanded him to be seated next to the count de Cabra.\r\n\r\nThe infanta Isabella came forth to this reception, and took her seat\r\nbeside the queen. When the court were all seated the music again sounded\r\nthrough the hall, and the twenty ladies came forth as on the preceding\r\noccasion, richly attired, but in different raiment. They danced as\r\nbefore, and the infanta Isabella, taking a young Portuguese damsel for a\r\npartner, joined in the dance. When this was concluded the king and queen\r\ndismissed the alcayde de los Donceles with great courtesy, and the court\r\nbroke up.\r\n\r\nThe worthy Fray Antonio Agapida here indulges in a long eulogy on the\r\nscrupulous discrimination of the Castilian court in the distribution of\r\nits honors and rewards, by which means every smile and gesture and word\r\nof the sovereigns had its certain value and conveyed its equivalent of\r\njoy to the heart of the subject--a matter well worthy the study (says\r\nhe) of all monarchs, who are too apt to distribute honors with a\r\nheedless caprice that renders them of no avail.\r\n\r\nOn the following Sunday both the count de Cabra and the alcayde de los\r\nDonceles were invited to sup with the sovereigns. The court that\r\nevening was attended by the highest nobility, arrayed with that cost and\r\nsplendor for which the Spanish nobility of those days were renowned.\r\n\r\nBefore supper there was a stately and ceremonious dance, befitting the\r\ndignity of so august a court. The king led forth the queen in grave and\r\ngraceful measure; the count de Cabra was honored with the hand of the\r\ninfanta Isabella; and the alcayde de los Donceles danced with a daughter\r\nof the marques de Astorga.\r\n\r\nThe dance being concluded, the royal party repaired to the supper-table,\r\nwhich was placed on an elevated part of the saloon. Here, in full view\r\nof the court, the count de Cabra and the alcayde de los Donceles supped\r\nat the same table with the king, the queen, and the infanta. The royal\r\nfamily were served by the marques of Villena. The cup-bearer to the king\r\nwas his nephew, Fadrigue de Toledo, son to the duke of Alva. Don Alexis\r\nde Estaniga had the honor of fulfilling that office for the queen,\r\nand Tello de Aguilar for the infanta. Other cavaliers of rank and\r\ndistinction waited on the count and the alcayde de los Donceles. At one\r\no’clock the two distinguished guests were dismissed with many courteous\r\nexpressions by the sovereigns.\r\n\r\nSuch (says Fray Antonio Agapida) were the great honors paid at our\r\nmost exalted and ceremonious court to these renowned cavaliers, but the\r\ngratitude of the sovereigns did not end here. A few days afterward they\r\nbestowed upon them large revenues for life, and others to descend to\r\ntheir heirs, with the privilege for them and their descendants to prefix\r\nthe title of Don to their names. They gave them, moreover, as armorial\r\nbearings a Moor’s head crowned, with a golden chain round the neck, in\r\na sanguine field, and twenty-two banners round the margin of the\r\nescutcheon. Their descendants, of the houses of Cabra and Cordova,\r\ncontinue to bear these arms at the present day in memorial of the\r\nvictory of Lucena and the capture of Boabdil el Chico.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * The account given by Fray Antonio Agapida of this ceremonial, so\r\ncharacteristic of the old Spanish court, agrees in almost every\r\nparticular with an ancient manuscript made up from the chronicles of the\r\ncurate of los Palacios and other old Spanish writers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nHOW THE MARQUES OF CADIZ CONCERTED TO SURPRISE ZAHARA, AND THE RESULT OF\r\nHIS ENTERPRISE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe valiant Roderigo Ponce de Leon, marques of Cadiz, was one of the\r\nmost vigilant of commanders. He kept in his pay a number of converted\r\nMoors to serve as adalides, or armed guides. These mongrel Christians\r\nwere of great service in procuring information. Availing themselves of\r\ntheir Moorish character and tongue, they penetrated into the enemy’s\r\ncountry, prowled about the castles and fortresses, noticed the state of\r\nthe walls, the gates, and towers, the strength of their garrisons, and\r\nthe vigilance or negligence of their commanders. All this they minutely\r\nreported to the marques, who thus knew the state of every fortress upon\r\nthe frontier and when it might be attacked with advantage. Besides the\r\nvarious town and cities over which he held feudal sway, he had always\r\nan armed force about him ready for the field. A host of retainers fed\r\nin his hall who were ready to follow him to danger, and death itself,\r\nwithout inquiring who or why they fought. The armories of his castles\r\nwere supplied with helms and cuirasses and weapons of all kinds, ready\r\nburnished for use; and his stables were filled with hardy steeds that\r\ncould stand a mountain-scamper.\r\n\r\nThe marques was aware that the late defeat of the Moors on the banks of\r\nthe Lopera had weakened their whole frontier, for many of the castles\r\nand fortresses had lost their alcaydes and their choicest troops. He\r\nsent out his war-hounds, therefore, upon the range to ascertain where a\r\nsuccessful blow might be struck; and they soon returned with word that\r\nZahara was weakly garrisoned and short of provisions.\r\n\r\nThis was the very fortress which, about two years before, had been\r\nstormed by Muley Abul Hassan, and its capture had been the first blow\r\nof this eventful war. It had ever since remained a thorn in the side\r\nof Andalusia. All the Christians had been carried away captive, and no\r\ncivil population had been introduced in their stead. There were no\r\nwomen or children in the place. It was kept up as a mere military post,\r\ncommanding one of the most important passes of the mountains, and was a\r\nstronghold of Moorish marauders. The marques was animated by the idea\r\nof regaining this fortress for his sovereigns and wresting from the\r\nold Moorish king this boasted trophy of his prowess. He sent missives,\r\ntherefore, to the brave Luis Fernandez Puerto Carrero, who had\r\ndistinguished himself in the late victory, and to Juan Almaraz, captain\r\nof the men-at-arms of the Holy Brotherhood, informing them of his\r\ndesigns, and inviting them to meet him with their forces on the banks of\r\nthe Guadalete.\r\n\r\nIt was on the day (says Fray Antonio Agapida) of the glorious apostles\r\nSt. Simon and Judas, the twenty-eighth of October, in the year of grace\r\none thousand four hundred and eighty-three, that this chosen band of\r\nChristian soldiers assembled suddenly and secretly at the appointed\r\nplace. Their forces when united amounted to six hundred horse and\r\nfifteen hundred foot. Their gathering-place was at the entrance of\r\nthe defile leading to Zahara. That ancient town, renowned in Moorish\r\nwarfare, is situated in one of the roughest passes of the Serrania de\r\nRonda. It is built round the craggy cone of a hill, on the lofty summit\r\nof which is a strong castle. The country around is broken into deep\r\nbarrancas or ravines, some of which approach its very walls. The place\r\nhad until recently been considered impregnable, but (as the worthy Fray\r\nAntonio Agapida observes) the walls of impregnable fortresses, like the\r\nvirtue of self-confident saints, have their weak points of attack.\r\n\r\nThe marques of Cadiz advanced with his little army in the dead of\r\nthe night, marching silently into the deep and dark defiles of the\r\nmountains, and stealing up the ravines which extended to the walls of\r\nthe town. Their approach was so noiseless that the Moorish sentinels\r\nupon the walls heard not a voice or a footfall. The marques was\r\naccompanied by his old escalador, Ortega de Prado, who had distinguished\r\nhimself at the scaling of Alhama. This hardy veteran was stationed,\r\nwith ten men furnished with scaling-ladders, in a cavity among the\r\nrocks close to the walls. At a little distance seventy men were hid in\r\na ravine, to be at hand to second him when he should have fixed his\r\nladders. The rest of the troops were concealed in another ravine\r\ncommanding a fair approach to the gate of the fortress. A shrewd and\r\nwary adalid, well acquainted with the place, was appointed to give\r\nsignals, and so stationed that he could be seen by the various parties\r\nin ambush, but not by the garrison.\r\n\r\nBy orders of the marques a small body of light cavalry passed along the\r\nglen, and, turning round a point of rock, showed themselves before the\r\ntown: they (6) skirred the fields almost to the gates, as if by way of\r\nbravado and to defy the garrison to a skirmish. The Moors were not slow\r\nin replying to it. About seventy horse and a number of foot who had\r\nguarded the walls sallied forth impetuously, thinking to make easy prey\r\nof these insolent marauders. The Christian horsemen fled for the ravine;\r\nthe Moors pursued them down the hill, until they heard a great shouting\r\nand tumult behind them. Looking round toward the town, they beheld a\r\nscaling party mounting the walls sword in hand. Wheeling about, they\r\ngalloped for the gate: the marques of Cadiz and Luis Fernandez Puerto\r\nCarrero rushed forth at the same time with their ambuscade, and\r\nendeavored to cut them off, but the Moors succeeded in throwing\r\nthemselves within the walls.\r\n\r\nWhile Puerto Carrero stormed at the gate the marques put spurs to his\r\nhorse and galloped to the support of Ortega de Prado and his scaling\r\nparty. He arrived at a moment of imminent peril, when the party was\r\nassailed by fifty Moors armed with cuirasses and lances, who were on\r\nthe point of thrusting them from the walls. The marques sprang from\r\nhis horse, mounted a ladder sword in hand, followed by a number of\r\nhis troops, and made a vigorous attack upon the enemy.* They were soon\r\ndriven from the walls, and the gates and towers remained in possession\r\nof the Christians. The Moors defended themselves for a short time in\r\nthe streets, but at length took refuge in the castle, the walls of which\r\nwere strong and capable of holding out until relief should arrive. The\r\nmarques had no desire to carry on a siege, and he had not provisions\r\nsufficient for many prisoners; he granted them, therefore, favorable\r\nterms. They were permitted, on leaving their arms behind them, to\r\nmarch out with as much of their effects as they could carry, and it was\r\nstipulated that they should pass over to Barbary. The marques remained\r\nin the place until both town and castle were put in a perfect state of\r\ndefence and strongly garrisoned.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Cura de los Palacios, c. 68.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus did Zahara return once more in possession of the Christians, to the\r\ngreat confusion of old Muley Abul Hassan, who, having paid the penalty\r\nof his ill-timed violence, was now deprived of its vaunted fruits.\r\nThe Castilian sovereigns were so gratified by this achievement of the\r\nvaliant Ponce de Leon that they authorized him thenceforth to entitle\r\nhimself duke of Cadiz and marques of Zahara. The warrior, however, was\r\nso proud of the original title under which he had so often signalized\r\nhimself that he gave it the precedence, and always signed himself\r\nmarques, duke of Cadiz. As the reader may have acquired the same\r\npredilection, we shall continue to call him by his ancient title.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nOF THE FORTRESS OF ALHAMA, AND HOW WISELY IT WAS GOVERNED BY THE COUNT\r\nDE TENDILLA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this part of his chronicle the worthy father Fray Antonio Agapida\r\nindulges in triumphant exultation over the downfall of Zahara. Heaven\r\nsometimes speaks (says he) through the mouths of false prophets for the\r\nconfusion of the wicked. By the fall of this fortress was the prediction\r\nof the santon of Granada in some measure fulfilled, that “the ruins of\r\nZahara should fall upon the heads of the infidels.”\r\n\r\nOur zealous chronicler scoffs at the Moorish alcayde who lost his\r\nfortress by surprise in broad daylight, and contrasts the vigilance of\r\nthe Christian governor of Alhama, the town taken in retaliation for the\r\nstorming of Zahara.\r\n\r\nThe important post of Alhama was at this time confided by King Ferdinand\r\nto Don Inigo Lopez de Mendoza, count of Tendilla, a cavalier of noble\r\nblood, brother to the grand cardinal of Spain. He had been instructed by\r\nthe king not merely to maintain his post, but also to make sallies and\r\nlay waste the surrounding country. His fortress was critically situated.\r\nIt was within seven leagues of Granada, and at no great distance from\r\nthe warlike city of Loxa. It was nestled in the lap of the mountains\r\ncommanding the high-road to Malaga and a view over the extensive Vega.\r\nThus situated, in the heart of the enemy’s country, surrounded by foes\r\nready to assail him and a rich country for him to ravage, it behooved\r\nthis cavalier to be for ever on the alert. He was in fact an experienced\r\nveteran, a shrewd and wary officer, and a commander amazingly prompt and\r\nfertile in expedients.\r\n\r\nOn assuming the command he found that the garrison consisted but of one\r\nthousand men, horse and foot. They were hardy troops, seasoned in rough\r\nmountain-campaigning, but reckless and dissolute, as soldiers are apt\r\nto be when accustomed to predatory warfare. They would fight hard for\r\nbooty, and then gamble it heedlessly away or squander it in licentious\r\nrevelling. Alhama abounded with hawking, sharping, idle hangers-on,\r\neager to profit by the vices and follies of the garrison. The soldiers\r\nwere oftener gambling and dancing beneath the walls than keeping watch\r\nupon the battlements, and nothing was heard from morning till night\r\nbut the noisy contests of cards and dice, mingled with the sound of the\r\nbolero or fandango, the drowsy strumming of the guitar, and the rattling\r\nof the castanets, while often the whole was interrupted by the loud\r\nbrawl and fierce and bloody contest.\r\n\r\nThe count of Tendilla set himself vigorously to reform these excesses:\r\nhe knew that laxity of morals is generally attended by neglect of duty,\r\nand that the least breach of discipline in the exposed situation of his\r\nfortress might be fatal. “Here is but a handful of men,” said he; “it is\r\nnecessary that each man should be a hero.”\r\n\r\nHe endeavored to awaken a proper ambition in the minds of his soldiers\r\nand to instil into them the high principles of chivalry. “A just war,”\r\n he observed, “is often rendered wicked and disastrous by the manner\r\nin which it is conducted; for the righteousness of the cause is not\r\nsufficient to sanction the profligacy of the means, and the want of\r\norder and subordination among the troops may bring ruin and disgrace\r\nupon the best-concerted plans.” But we cannot describe the character and\r\nconduct of this renowned commander in more forcible language than that\r\nof Fray Antonio Agapida, excepting that the pious father places in\r\nthe foreground of his virtues his hatred of the Moors. “The count de\r\nTendilla,” says he, “was a mirror of Christian knighthood--watchful,\r\nabstemious, chaste, devout, and thoroughly filled with the spirit of the\r\ncause. He labored incessantly and strenuously for the glory of the faith\r\nand the prosperity of their most Catholic majesties; and, above all,\r\nhe hated the infidels with a pure and holy hatred. This worthy cavalier\r\ndiscountenanced all idleness, rioting, chambering, and wantonness among\r\nhis soldiery. He kept them constantly to the exercise of arms, making\r\nthem adroit in the use of their weapons and management of their steeds,\r\nand prompt for the field at a moment’s notice. He permitted no sound\r\nof lute or harp or song or other loose minstrelsy to be heard in his\r\nfortress, debauching the ear and softening the valor of the soldier;\r\nno other music was allowed but the wholesome rolling of the drum and\r\nbraying of the trumpet, and such like spirit-stirring instruments\r\nas fill the mind with thoughts of iron war. All wandering minstrels,\r\nsharping peddlers, sturdy trulls, and other camp trumpery were ordered\r\nto pack up their baggage, and were drummed out of the gates of Alhama.\r\nIn place of such lewd rabble he introduced a train of holy friars to\r\ninspirit his people by exhortation and prayer and choral chanting, and\r\nto spur them on to fight the good fight of faith. All games of chance\r\nwere prohibited except the game of war, and this he labored, by\r\nvigilance and vigor, to reduce to a game of certainty. Heaven smiled\r\nupon the efforts of this righteous cavalier. His men became soldiers at\r\nall points and terrors to the Moors. The good count never set forth on\r\na ravage without observing the rites of confession, absolution, and\r\ncommunion, and obliging his followers to do the same. Their banners were\r\nblessed by the holy friars whom he maintained in Alhama; and in\r\nthis way success was secured to his arms and he was enabled to lay waste\r\nthe land of the heathen.”\r\n\r\nThe fortress of Alhama (continues Fray Antonio Agapida) overlooked from\r\nits lofty site a great part of the fertile Vega, watered by the Cazin\r\nand the Xenil; from this he made frequent sallies, sweeping away the\r\nflocks and herds from the pasture, the laborer from the field, and the\r\nconvoy from the road; so that it was said by the Moors that a beetle\r\ncould not crawl across the Vega without being seen by Count Tendilla.\r\nThe peasantry, therefore, were fain to betake themselves to watch-towers\r\nand fortified hamlets, where they shut up their cattle, garnered their\r\ncorn, and sheltered their wives and children. Even there they were not\r\nsafe: the count would storm these rustic fortresses with fire and sword,\r\nmake captives of their inhabitants, carry off the corn, the oil, the\r\nsilks, and cattle, and leave the ruins blazing and smoking within the\r\nvery sight of Granada.\r\n\r\n“It was a pleasing and refreshing sight,” continues the good father, “to\r\nbehold this pious knight and his followers returning from one of these\r\ncrusades, leaving the rich land of the infidel in smoking desolation\r\nbehind them; to behold the long line of mules and asses laden with the\r\nplunder of the Gentiles--the hosts of captive Moors, men, women, and\r\nchildren--droves of sturdy beeves, lowing kine, and bleating sheep,--all\r\nwinding up the steep acclivity to the gates of Alhama, pricked on by the\r\nCatholic soldiery. His garrison thus thrived on the fat of the land\r\nand the spoil of the infidel; nor was he unmindful of the pious fathers\r\nwhose blessings crowned his enterprises with success. A large portion of\r\nthe spoil was always dedicated to the Church, and the good friars were\r\never ready at the gate to hail him on his return and receive the share\r\nallotted them. Besides these allotments, he made many votive offerings,\r\neither in time of peril or on the eve of a foray, and the chapels of\r\nAlhama were resplendent with chalices, crosses, and other precious gifts\r\nmade by this Catholic cavalier.”\r\n\r\nThus eloquently does the venerable Fray Antonio Agapida dilate in praise\r\nof the good count de Tendilla; and other historians of equal veracity,\r\nbut less unction, agree in pronouncing him one of the ablest of Spanish\r\ngenerals. So terrible, in fact, did he become in the land that the\r\nMoorish peasantry could not venture a league from Granada or Loxa to\r\nlabor in the fields without peril of being carried into captivity. The\r\npeople of Granada clamored against Muley Abul Hassan for suffering his\r\nlands to be thus outraged and insulted, and demanded to have this bold\r\nmarauder shut up in his fortress. The old monarch was roused by their\r\nremonstrances. He sent forth powerful troops of horse to protect the\r\ncountry during the season that the husbandmen were abroad in the fields.\r\nThese troops patrolled in formidable squadrons in the neighborhood of\r\nAlhama, keeping strict watch upon its gates, so that it was impossible\r\nfor the Christians to make a sally without being seen and intercepted.\r\n\r\nWhile Alhama was thus blockaded by a roving force of Moorish cavalry,\r\nthe inhabitants were awakened one night by a tremendous crash that shook\r\nthe fortress to its foundations. The garrison flew to arms, supposing it\r\nsome assault of the enemy. The alarm proved to have been caused by the\r\nrupture of a portion of the wall, which, undermined by heavy rains, had\r\nsuddenly given way, leaving a large chasm yawning toward the plain.\r\n\r\nThe count de Tendilla was for a time in great anxiety. Should this\r\nbreach be discovered by the blockading horsemen, they would arouse the\r\ncountry, Granada and Loxa would pour out an overwhelming force, and\r\nthey would find his walls ready sapped for an assault. In this fearful\r\nemergency the count displayed his noted talent for expedients. He\r\nordered a quantity of linen cloth to be stretched in front of the\r\nbreach, painted in imitation of stone and indented with battlements, so\r\nas at a distance to resemble the other parts of the walls: behind this\r\nscreen he employed workmen day and night in repairing the fracture.\r\nNo one was permitted to leave the fortress, lest information of its\r\ndefenceless plight should be carried to the Moor. Light squadrons of\r\nthe enemy were seen hovering about the plain, but never approached near\r\nenough to discover the deception; and thus in the course of a few days\r\nthe wall was rebuilt stronger than before.\r\n\r\nThere was another expedient of this shrewd veteran which greatly excites\r\nthe marvel of Agapida. “It happened,” he observes, “that this Catholic\r\ncavalier at one time was destitute of gold and silver wherewith to pay\r\nthe wages of his troops; and the soldiers murmured greatly, seeing that\r\nthey had not the means of purchasing necessaries from the people of the\r\ntown. In this dilemma what does this most sagacious commander? He\r\ntakes me a number of little morsels of paper, on the which he inscribes\r\nvarious sums, large and small, according to the nature of the case,\r\nand signs me them with his own hand and name. These did he give to the\r\nsoldiery in earnest of their pay. ‘How!’ you will say, ‘are soldiers to\r\nbe paid with scraps of paper?’ Even so, I answer, and well paid too, as\r\nI will presently make manifest, for the good count issued a proclamation\r\nordering the inhabitants of Alhama to take these morsels of paper for\r\nthe full amount thereon inscribed, promising to redeem them at a future\r\ntime with silver and gold, and threatening severe punishment to all\r\nwho should refuse. The people, having full confidence in his word, and\r\ntrusting that he would be as willing to perform the one promise as he\r\ncertainly was able to perform the other, took those curious morsels of\r\npaper without hesitation or demur. Thus by a subtle and most miraculous\r\nkind of alchymy did this Catholic cavalier turn worthless paper into\r\nprecious gold, and make his late impoverished garrison abound in money!”\r\n\r\nIt is but just to add that the count de Tendilla redeemed his promises\r\nlike a loyal knight; and this miracle, as it appeared in the eyes of\r\nFray Antonio Agapida, is the first instance on record of paper money,\r\nwhich has since inundated the civilized world with unbounded opulence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nFORAY OF CHRISTIAN KNIGHTS INTO THE TERRITORY OF THE MOORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Spanish cavaliers who had survived the memorable massacre among the\r\nmountains of Malaga, although they had repeatedly avenged the deaths of\r\ntheir companions, could not forget the horror and humiliation of their\r\ndefeat. Nothing would satisfy them but a second expedition of the\r\nkind to carry fire and sword throughout a wide part of the Moorish\r\nterritories, and leave the region which had triumphed in their disaster\r\na black and burning monument of their vengeance. Their wishes accorded\r\nwith the policy of the king to destroy the resources of the enemy; every\r\nassistance was therefore given to their enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1484 the ancient city of Antiquera again resounded with\r\narms; numbers of the same cavaliers who had assembled there so gayly\r\nthe preceding year came wheeling into the gates with their steeled and\r\nshining warriors, but with a more dark and solemn brow than on that\r\ndisastrous occasion, for they had the recollection of their slaughtered\r\nfriends present to their minds, whose deaths they were to avenge.\r\n\r\nIn a little while there was a chosen force of six thousand horse and\r\ntwelve thousand foot assembled in Antiquera, many of them the very\r\nflower of Spanish chivalry, troops of the established military and\r\nreligious orders and of the Holy Brotherhood.\r\n\r\nPrecautions had been taken to furnish this army with all things needful\r\nfor its perilous inroad. Numerous surgeons accompanied it, who were to\r\nattend upon the sick and wounded without charge, being paid for their\r\nservices by the queen. Isabella also, in her considerate humanity,\r\nprovided six spacious tents furnished with beds and all things needful\r\nfor the wounded and infirm. These continued to be used in all great\r\nexpeditions throughout the war, and were called the Queen’s Hospital.\r\nThe worthy father, Fray Antonio Agapida, vaunts this benignant provision\r\nof the queen as the first introduction of a regular camp hospital in\r\ncampaigning service.\r\n\r\nThus thoroughly prepared, the cavaliers issued forth from Antiquera\r\nin splendid and terrible array, but with less exulting confidence and\r\nvaunting ostentation than on their former foray; and this was the order\r\nof the army: Don Alonso de Aguilar led the advance guard, accompanied\r\nby Don Diego Fernandez de Cordova, the alcayde de los Donceles, and Luis\r\nFernandez Puerto Carrero, count of Palma, with their household troops.\r\nThey were followed by Juan de Merlo, Juan de Almara, and Carlos\r\nde Biezman of the Holy Brotherhood, with the men-at-arms of their\r\ncaptaincies.\r\n\r\nThe second battalion was commanded by the marques of Cadiz and the\r\nmaster of Santiago, with the cavaliers of Santiago and the troops of\r\nthe house of Ponce Leon; with these also went the senior commander of\r\nCalatrava and the knights of that order, and various other cavaliers and\r\ntheir retainers.\r\n\r\nThe right wing of this second battalion was led by Gonsalvo de Cordova,\r\nafterward renowned as grand captain of Spain; the left by Diego Lopez\r\nde Avila. They were accompanied by several distinguished cavaliers and\r\ncertain captains of the Holy Brotherhood with their men-at-arms.\r\n\r\nThe duke of Medina Sidonia and the count de Cabra commanded the third\r\nbattalion, with the troops of their respective houses. They were\r\naccompanied by other commanders of note with their forces.\r\n\r\nThe rear-guard was brought up by the senior commander and knights of\r\nAlcantara, followed by the Andalusian chivalry from Xeres, Ecija, and\r\nCarmona.\r\n\r\nSuch was the army that issued forth from the gates of Antiquera on one\r\nof the most extensive “talas,” or devastating inroads, that ever laid\r\nwaste the kingdom of Granada.\r\n\r\nThe army entered the Moorish territory by the way of Alora, destroying\r\nall the cornfields, vineyards, and orchards and plantations of olives\r\nround that city. It then proceeded through the rich valleys and fertile\r\nuplands of Coin, Cazarabonela, Almexia, and Cartama, and in ten days\r\nall those fertile regions were a smoking and frightful desert. Hence it\r\npursued its slow and destructive course, like the stream of lava of a\r\nvolcano, through the regions of Pupiana and Alhendin, and so on to the\r\nvega of Malaga, laying waste the groves of olives and almonds and the\r\nfields of grain, and destroying every green thing. The Moors of some of\r\nthose places interceded in vain for their groves and fields, offering to\r\ndeliver up their Christian captives. One part of the army blockaded the\r\ntowns, while the other ravaged the surrounding country. Sometimes the\r\nMoors sallied forth desperately to defend their property, but were\r\ndriven back to their gates with slaughter and their suburbs pillaged and\r\nburnt. It was an awful spectacle at night to behold the volumes of black\r\nsmoke mingled with lurid flames rising from the burning suburbs, and the\r\nwomen on the walls of the town wringing their hands and shrieking at the\r\ndesolation of their dwellings.\r\n\r\nThe destroying army on arriving at the sea-coast found vessels lying off\r\nshore laden with all kinds of provisions and munitions sent from Seville\r\nand Xeres, and was thus enabled to continue its desolating career.\r\nAdvancing to the neighborhood of Malaga, it was bravely assailed by the\r\nMoors of that city, and there was severe skirmishing for a whole day;\r\nbut, while the main part of the army encountered the enemy, the rest\r\nravaged the whole vega and destroyed all the mills. As the object of the\r\nexpedition was not to capture places, but merely to burn, ravage, and\r\ndestroy, the host, satisfied with the mischief they had done in the\r\nvega, turned their backs upon Malaga and again entered the mountains.\r\nThey passed by Coin and through the regions of Allazayna, and Gatero,\r\nand Alhaurin, all which were likewise desolated. In this way did they\r\nmake the circuit of a chain of rich and verdant valleys, the glory of\r\nthose mountains and the pride and delight of the Moors. For forty\r\ndays did they continue on like a consuming fire, leaving a smoking\r\nand howling waste to mark their course, until, weary with the work of\r\ndestruction, and having fully sated their revenge for the massacre of\r\nthe Axarquia, they returned in triumph to the meadows of Antiquera.\r\n\r\nIn the month of June, King Ferdinand took command in person of this\r\ndestructive army; he increased its force, and added to its means of\r\nmischief several lombards and other heavy artillery, intended for the\r\nbattering of towns and managed by engineers from France and Germany.\r\nWith these the (7) marques of Cadiz assured the king he would soon be able\r\nto reduce the Moorish fortresses, which were only calculated for defence\r\nagainst the engines anciently used in warfare. Their walls and towers\r\nwere high and thin, depending for security on their rough and rocky\r\nsituations. The stone and iron balls thundered from the lombards would\r\nsoon tumble them in ruins upon the heads of their defenders.\r\n\r\nThe fate of Alora speedily proved the truth of this opinion. It was\r\nstrongly posted on a rock washed by a river. The artillery soon battered\r\ndown two of the towers and a part of the wall. The Moors were thrown\r\ninto consternation at the vehemence of the assault and the effect of\r\nthose tremendous engines upon their vaunted bulwarks. The roaring of the\r\nartillery and the tumbling of the walls terrified the women, who beset\r\nthe alcayde with vociferous supplications to surrender. The place was\r\ngiven up on the 20th of June, on condition that the inhabitants might\r\ndepart with their effects. The people of Malaga, as yet unacquainted\r\nwith the power of this battering ordnance, were so incensed at those\r\nof Alora for what they considered a tame surrender that they would not\r\nadmit them into their city.\r\n\r\nA similar fate attended the town of Setenil, built on a lofty rock\r\nand esteemed impregnable. Many times had it been besieged under former\r\nChristian kings, but never taken. Even now, for several days the\r\nartillery was directed against it without effect, and many of the\r\ncavaliers murmured at the marques of Cadiz for having counselled the\r\nking to attack this unconquerable place.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Cura de los Palacios.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the same night that these reproaches were uttered the marques\r\ndirected the artillery himself: he levelled the lombards at the bottom\r\nof the walls and at the gates. In a little while the gates were battered\r\nto pieces, a great breach was effected in the walls, and the Moors were\r\nfain to capitulate. Twenty-four Christian captives, who had been taken\r\nin the defeat of the mountains of Malaga, were rescued from the dungeons\r\nof this fortress, and hailed the marques as their deliverer.\r\n\r\nNeedless is it to mention the capture of various other places which\r\nsurrendered without waiting to be attacked. The Moors had always shown\r\ngreat bravery and perseverance in defending their towns; they were\r\nformidable in their sallies and skirmishes, and patient in enduring\r\nhunger and thirst when besieged; but this terrible ordnance, which\r\ndemolished their walls with such ease and rapidity, overwhelmed them\r\nwith dismay and rendered vain all resistance. King Ferdinand was so\r\nstruck with the effect of this artillery that he ordered the number\r\nof lombards to be increased; and these potent engines had henceforth a\r\ngreat influence on the fortunes of this war.\r\n\r\nThe last operation of this year, so disastrous to the Moors, was an\r\ninroad by Ferdinand, in the latter part of summer, into the Vega, in\r\nwhich he ravaged the country, burnt two villages near to Granada, and\r\ndestroyed the mills near the very gates of the city.\r\n\r\nOld Muley Abul Hassan was overwhelmed with dismay at the desolation\r\nwhich during the whole year had raged throughout his territories and had\r\nnow reached the walls of his capital. His fierce spirit was broken by\r\nmisfortunes and infirmity; he offered to purchase a peace and to\r\nhold his crown as a tributary vassal. Ferdinand would listen to no\r\npropositions: the absolute conquest of Granada was the great object of\r\nthis war, and he was resolved never to rest content without its complete\r\nfulfilment. Having supplied and strengthened the garrisons of the\r\nplaces taken in the heart of the Moorish territories, he enjoined their\r\ncommanders to render every assistance to the younger Moorish king in the\r\ncivil war against his father. He then returned with his army to Cordova\r\nin great triumph, closing a series of ravaging campaigns which had\r\nfilled the kingdom of Granada with grief and consternation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nATTEMPT OF EL ZAGAL TO SURPRISE BOABDIL IN ALMERIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring this year of sorrow and disaster to the Moors the younger king,\r\nBoabdil, most truly called the Unfortunate, held a diminished and feeble\r\ncourt in the maritime city of Almeria. He retained little more than the\r\nname of king, and was supported in even this shadow of royalty by the\r\ncountenance and treasures of the Castilian sovereigns. Still he trusted\r\nthat in the fluctuation of events the inconstant nation might once more\r\nreturn to his standard and replace him on the throne of the Alhambra.\r\n\r\nHis mother, the high-spirited sultana Ayxa la Horra, endeavored to rouse\r\nhim from this passive state. “It is a feeble mind,” said she, “that\r\nwaits for the turn of fortune’s wheel; the brave mind seizes upon it and\r\nturns it to its purpose. Take the field, and you may drive danger before\r\nyou; remain cowering at home, and it besieges you in your dwelling. By\r\na bold enterprise you may regain your splendid throne in Granada; by\r\npassive forbearance you will forfeit even this miserable throne in\r\nAlmeria.”\r\n\r\nBoabdil had not the force of soul to follow these courageous counsels,\r\nand in a little time the evils his mother had predicted fell upon him.\r\n\r\nOld Muley Abul Hassan was almost extinguished by age and paralysis. He\r\nhad nearly lost his sight, and was completely bedridden. His brother,\r\nAbdallah, surnamed El Zagal, or the Valiant, the same who had assisted\r\nin the massacre of the Spanish chivalry among the mountains of Malaga,\r\nwas commander-in-chief of the Moorish armies, and gradually took upon\r\nhimself most of the cares of sovereignty. Among other things, he was\r\nparticularly zealous in espousing his brother’s quarrel with his son,\r\nand he prosecuted it with such vehemence that many affirmed there was\r\nsomething more than mere fraternal sympathy at the bottom of his zeal.\r\n\r\nThe disasters and disgraces inflicted on the country by the Christians\r\nduring this year had wounded the national feelings of the people of\r\nAlmeria, and many felt indignant that Boabdil should remain passive at\r\nsuch a time, or, rather, should appear to make a common cause with\r\nthe enemy. His uncle Abdallah diligently fomented this feeling by his\r\nagents. The same arts were made use of that had been successful in\r\nGranada. Boabdil was secretly but actively denounced by the alfaquis\r\nas an apostate leagued with the Christians against his country and his\r\nearly faith; the affections of the populace and soldiery were gradually\r\nalienated from him, and a deep conspiracy concerted for his destruction.\r\n\r\nIn the month of February, 1485, El Zagal suddenly appeared before\r\nAlmeria at the head of a troop of horse. The alfaquis were prepared for\r\nhis arrival, and the gates were thrown open to him. He entered with\r\nhis band and galloped to the citadel. The alcayde would have made\r\nresistance, but the garrison put him to death and received El Zagal with\r\nacclamations. The latter rushed through the apartments of the Alcazar,\r\nbut he sought in vain for Boabdil. He found the sultana Ayxa la Horra\r\nin one of the saloons with Aben Haxig, a younger brother of the monarch,\r\nand several Abencerrages, who rallied round them to protect them. “Where\r\nis the traitor Boabdil?” exclaimed El Zagal.\r\n\r\n“I know no traitor more perfidious than thyself,” exclaimed the intrepid\r\nsultana; “and I trust my son is in safety, to take vengeance on thy\r\ntreason.”\r\n\r\nThe rage of El Zagal was without bounds when he learnt that his intended\r\nvictim had escaped. In his fury he slew the prince Aben Haxig, and his\r\nfollowers fell upon and massacred the Abencerrages. As to the proud\r\nsultana, she was borne away prisoner and loaded with revilings as having\r\nupheld her son in his rebellion and fomented a civil war.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Boabdil had been apprised of his danger by a faithful\r\nsoldier just in time to make his escape. Throwing himself on one of his\r\nfleetest horses and followed by a handful of adherents, he galloped in\r\nthe confusion out of the gates of Almeria. Several of the cavalry of El\r\nZagal, stationed without the walls, perceived his flight and attempted\r\nto pursue him; their horses were jaded with travel, and he soon left\r\nthem far behind. But whither was he to fly? Every fortress and castle\r\nin the kingdom of Granada was closed against him; he knew not whom among\r\nthe Moors to trust, for they had been taught to detest him as a traitor\r\nand an apostate. He had no alternative but to seek refuge among the\r\nChristians, his hereditary enemies. With heavy heart he turned his\r\nhorse’s head toward Cordova. He had to lurk, like a fugitive, through a\r\npart of his own dominions, nor did he feel himself secure until he\r\nhad passed the frontier and beheld the mountain-barrier of his country\r\ntowering behind him. Then it was that he became conscious of his\r\nhumiliated state--a fugitive from his throne, an outcast from his\r\nnation, a king without a kingdom. He smote his breast in an agony of\r\ngrief. “Evil indeed,” exclaimed he, “was the day of my birth, and truly\r\nI was named El Zogoybi, the Unlucky.”\r\n\r\nHe entered the gates of Cordova with downcast countenance and with\r\na train of but forty followers. The sovereigns were absent, but the\r\ncavaliers of Andalusia manifested that sympathy in the misfortunes\r\nof the monarch which becomes men of lofty and chivalrous souls. They\r\nreceived him with great distinction, attended him with the utmost\r\ncourtesy, and he was honorably entertained by the civil and military\r\ncommanders of that ancient city.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, El Zagal put a new alcayde over Almeria to govern\r\nin the name of his brother, and, having strongly garrisoned the place,\r\nrepaired to Malaga, where an attack of the Christians was apprehended.\r\nThe young monarch being driven out of the land, and the old monarch\r\nblind and bedridden, El Zagal at the head of the armies was virtually\r\nthe sovereign of Granada. He was supported by the brave and powerful\r\nfamilies of the Alnayans and Vanegas; the people were pleased with\r\nhaving a new idol to look up to and a new name to shout forth; and El\r\nZagal was hailed with acclamations as the main hope of the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nHOW KING FERDINAND COMMENCED ANOTHER CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE MOORS, AND HOW\r\nHE LAID SIEGE TO COIN AND CARTAMA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe recent effect of the battering ordnance in demolishing the Moorish\r\nfortresses induced King Ferdinand to procure a powerful train for the\r\ncampaign of 1485, intending to assault some of the most formidable holds\r\nof the enemy.\r\n\r\nAn army of nine thousand cavalry and twenty thousand infantry assembled\r\nat Cordova early in the spring, and the king took the field on the 5th\r\nof April. It had been determined in secret council to attack the city of\r\nMalaga, that ancient and important seaport on which Granada depended for\r\nforeign aid and supplies. It was thought proper previously, however, to\r\nget possession of various towns and fortresses in the valleys of Santa\r\nMaria and Cartama, through which pass the roads to Malaga.\r\n\r\nThe first place assailed was the town of Benamexi or Bonameji. It had\r\nsubmitted to the Catholic sovereigns in the preceding year, but had\r\nsince renounced its allegiance. King Ferdinand was enraged at the\r\nrebellion of the inhabitants. “I will make their punishment,” said he,\r\n“a terror to others: they shall be loyal through force, if not through\r\nfaith.” The place was carried by storm: one hundred and eight of the\r\nprincipal inhabitants were either put to the sword or hanged on the\r\nbattlements; the rest were carried into captivity.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Pulgar, Garibay, Cura de los Palacios.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe towns of Coin and Cartama were besieged on the same day--the first\r\nby a division of the army led on by the marques of Cadiz; the second by\r\nanother division commanded by Don Alonso de Aguilar and Luis Fernandez\r\nPuerto Carrero, the brave senior of Palma. The king, with the rest of\r\nthe army, remained posted between the two places to render assistance to\r\neither division. The batteries opened upon both places at the same time,\r\nand the thunder of the lombards was mutually heard from one camp to the\r\nother. The Moors made frequent sallies and a valiant defence, but\r\nthey were confounded by the tremendous uproar of the batteries and the\r\ndestruction of their walls. In the mean time, the alarm-fires gathered\r\ntogether the Moorish mountaineers of all the Serrania, who assembled in\r\ngreat numbers in the city of Monda, about a league from Coin. They made\r\nseveral attempts to enter the besieged town, but in vain: they were each\r\ntime intercepted and driven back by the Christians, and were reduced\r\nto gaze at a distance in despair on the destruction of the place. While\r\nthus situated there rode one day into Monda a fierce and haughty Moorish\r\nchieftain at the head of a band of swarthy African horsemen: it was\r\nHamet el Zegri, the fiery-spirited alcayde of Ronda, at the head of\r\nhis band of Gomeres. He had not yet recovered from the rage and\r\nmortification of his defeat on the banks of the Lopera in the disastrous\r\nforay of old Bexir, when he had been obliged to steal back furtively to\r\nhis mountains with the loss of the bravest of his followers. He had\r\never since panted for revenge. He now rode among the host of warriors\r\nassembled at Monda. “Who among you,” cried he, “feels pity for the women\r\nand children of Coin exposed to captivity and death? Whoever he is,\r\nlet him follow me, who am ready to die as a Moslem for the relief of\r\nMoslems.” So saying, he seized a white banner, and, waving it over his\r\nhead, rode forth from the town, followed by the Gomeres. Many of the\r\nwarriors, roused by his words and his example, spurred resolutely after\r\nhis banner. The people of Coin, being prepared for this attempt, sallied\r\nforth as they saw the white banner and made an attack upon the Christian\r\ncamp, and in the confusion of the moment Hamet and his followers\r\ngalloped into the gates. This reinforcement animated the besieged, and\r\nHamet exhorted them to hold out obstinately in defence of life and town.\r\nAs the Gomeres were veteran warriors, the more they were attacked the\r\nharder they fought.\r\n\r\nAt length a great breach was made in the walls, and Ferdinand, who was\r\nimpatient of the resistance of the place, ordered the duke of Naxara and\r\nthe count of Benavente to enter with their troops, and, as their forces\r\nwere not sufficient, he sent word to Luis de Cerda, duke of Medina Celi,\r\nto send a part of his people to their assistance.\r\n\r\nThe feudal pride of the duke was roused at this demand. “Tell my lord\r\nthe king,” said the haughty grandee, “that I have come to succor him\r\nwith my household troops: if my people are ordered to any place, I am to\r\ngo with them; but if I am to remain in the camp, my people must remain\r\nwith me. For the troops cannot serve without their commander, nor their\r\ncommander without his troops.”\r\n\r\nThe reply of the high-spirited grandee perplexed the cautious Ferdinand,\r\nwho knew the jealous pride of his powerful nobles. In the mean time, the\r\npeople of the camp, having made all preparations for the assault, were\r\nimpatient to be led forward. Upon this Pero Ruyz de Alarcon put himself\r\nat their head, and, seizing their mantas or portable bulwarks, and their\r\nother defences, they made a gallant assault and fought their way in at\r\nthe breach. The Moors were so overcome by the fury of their assault\r\nthat they retreated, fighting, to the square of the town. Pero Ruyz\r\nde Alarcon thought the place was carried, when suddenly Hamet and his\r\nGomeres came scouring through the streets with wild war-cries, and fell\r\nfuriously upon the Christians. The latter were in their turn beaten\r\nback, and, while attacked in front by the Gomeres, were assailed by the\r\ninhabitants with all kinds of missiles from their roofs and windows.\r\nThey at length gave way and retreated through the breach. Pero Ruyz de\r\nAlarcon still maintained his ground in one of the principal streets: the\r\nfew cavaliers that stood by him urged him to fly: “No,” said he; “I\r\ncame here to fight, and not to fly.” He was presently surrounded by the\r\nGomeres; his companions fled for their lives: the last they saw of him\r\nhe was covered with wounds, but still fighting desperately for the fame\r\nof a good cavalier.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Pulgar, part 3, cap. 42.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe resistance of the inhabitants, though aided by the valor of the\r\nGomeres, was of no avail. The battering artillery of the Christians\r\ndemolished their walls; combustibles thrown into their town set it on\r\nfire in various places; and they were at length compelled to capitulate.\r\nThey were permitted to depart with their effects, and the Gomeres with\r\ntheir arms. Hamet el Zegri and his African band rode proudly through the\r\nChristian camp, nor could the Spanish cavaliers refrain from regarding\r\nwith admiration that haughty warrior and his devoted and dauntless\r\nfollowers.\r\n\r\nThe capture of Coin was accompanied by that of Cartama: the\r\nfortifications of the latter were repaired and garrisoned, but Coin,\r\nbeing too extensive to be defended by a moderate force, its walls\r\nwere demolished. The siege of these places struck such terror into the\r\nsurrounding country that the Moors of many of the neighboring towns\r\nabandoned their homes, and fled with such of their effects as they could\r\ncarry away, upon which the king gave orders to demolish their walls and\r\ntowers.\r\n\r\nKing Ferdinand now left his camp and his heavy artillery near Cartama,\r\nand proceeded with his lighter troops to reconnoitre Malaga. By this\r\ntime the secret plan of attack arranged in the council of war at Cordova\r\nwas known to all the world. The vigilant warrior, El Zagal, had thrown\r\nhimself into the place, put all the fortifications, which were of vast\r\nstrength, into a state of defence, and sent orders to the alcaydes of\r\nthe mountain-towns to hasten with their forces to his assistance.\r\n\r\nThe very day that Ferdinand appeared before the place El Zagal sallied\r\nforth to receive him at the head of a thousand cavalry, the choicest\r\nwarriors of Granada. A sharp skirmish took place among the gardens and\r\nolive trees near the city. Many were killed on both sides, and this gave\r\nthe Christians a foretaste of what they might expect if they attempted\r\nto besiege the place.\r\n\r\nWhen the skirmish was over the marques of Cadiz had a private conference\r\nwith the king. He represented the difficulty of besieging Malaga with\r\ntheir present force, especially as their plans had been discovered and\r\nanticipated, and the whole country was marching to oppose them. The\r\nmarques, who had secret intelligence from all quarters, had received\r\na letter from Juceph Xerife, a Moor of Ronda of Christian lineage,\r\napprising him of the situation of that important place and its garrison,\r\nwhich at that moment laid it open to attack, and the marques was urgent\r\nwith the king to seize upon this critical moment, and secure a place\r\nwhich was one of the most powerful Moorish fortresses on the frontiers,\r\nand in the hands of Hamet el Zegri had been the scourge of Andalusia.\r\nThe good marques had another motive for his advice, becoming a true and\r\nloyal knight. In the deep dungeons of Ronda languished several of his\r\ncompanion-in-arms who had been captured in the defeat in the Axarquia.\r\nTo break their chains and restore them to liberty and light he felt\r\nto be his peculiar duty as one of those who had most promoted that\r\ndisastrous enterprise.\r\n\r\nKing Ferdinand listened to the advice of the marques. He knew the\r\nimportance of Ronda, which was considered one of the keys to the kingdom\r\nof Granada, and he was disposed to punish the inhabitants for the\r\naid they had rendered to the garrison of Coin. The siege of Malaga\r\ntherefore, was abandoned for the present, and preparations made for a\r\nrapid and secret move against the city of Ronda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nSIEGE OF RONDA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bold Hamet el Zegri, the alcayde of Ronda, had returned sullenly to\r\nhis stronghold after the surrender of Coin. He had fleshed his sword\r\nin battle with the Christians, but his thirst for vengeance was still\r\nunsatisfied. Hamet gloried in the strength of his fortress and the valor\r\nof his people. A fierce and warlike populace was at his command; his\r\nsignal-fires could summon all the warriors of the Serrania; his Gomeres\r\nalmost subsisted on the spoils of Andalusia; and in the rock on which\r\nhis fortress was built were hopeless dungeons filled with Christian\r\ncaptives carried off by these war-hawks of the mountains.\r\n\r\nRonda was considered as impregnable. It was situated in the heart of\r\nwild and rugged mountains, and perched upon an isolated rock crested by\r\na strong citadel, with triple walls and towers. A deep ravine, or rather\r\na perpendicular chasm of the rocks, of frightful depth, surrounded three\r\nparts of the city; through this flowed the Rio Verde, or Green River.\r\nThere were two suburbs to the city, fortified by walls and towers, and\r\nalmost inaccessible from the natural asperity of the rocks. Around\r\nthis rugged city were deep rich valleys, sheltered by the mountains,\r\nrefreshed by constant streams, abounding with grain and the most\r\ndelicious fruits, and yielding verdant meadows, in which was reared a\r\nrenowned breed of horses, the best in the whole kingdom for a foray.\r\n\r\nHamet el Zegri had scarcely returned to Ronda when he received\r\nintelligence that the Christian army was marching to the siege of\r\nMalaga, and orders from El Zagal to send troops to his assistance.\r\nHamet sent a part of his garrison for that purpose; in the mean time he\r\nmeditated an expedition to which he was stimulated by pride and revenge.\r\nAll Andalusia was now drained of its troops; there was an opportunity,\r\ntherefore, for an inroad by which he might wipe out the disgrace of\r\nhis defeat at the battle of Lopera. Apprehending no danger to his\r\nmountain-city, now that the storm of war had passed down into the vega\r\nof Malaga, he left but a remnant of his garrison to man its walls, and,\r\nputting himself at the head of his band of Gomeres, swept down suddenly\r\ninto the plains of Andalusia. He careered, almost without resistance,\r\nover those vast campinas or pasture-lands which formed a part of the\r\ndomains of the duke of Medina Sidonia. In vain the bells were rung and\r\nthe alarm-fires kindled: the band of Hamet had passed by before any\r\nforce could be assembled, and was only to be traced, like a hurricane,\r\nby the devastation it had made.\r\n\r\nHamet regained in safety the Serrania de Ronda, exulting in his\r\nsuccessful inroad. The mountain-glens were filled with long droves of\r\ncattle and flocks of sheep from the campinas of Medina Sidonia. There\r\nwere mules, too, laden with the plunder of the villages, and every\r\nwarrior had some costly spoil of jewels for his favorite mistress.\r\n\r\nAs the Zegri drew near to Ronda he was roused from his dream of triumph\r\nby the sound of heavy ordnance bellowing through the mountain-defiles.\r\nHis heart misgave him: he put spurs to his horse and galloped in advance\r\nof his lagging cavalgada. As he proceeded the noise of the ordnance\r\nincreased, echoing from cliff to cliff. Spurring his horse up a\r\ncraggy height which commanded an extensive view, he beheld, to his\r\nconsternation, the country about Ronda white with the tents of a\r\nbesieging army. The royal standard, displayed before a proud encampment,\r\nshowed that Ferdinand himself was present, while the incessant blaze and\r\nthunder of artillery and the volumes of overhanging smoke told the work\r\nof destruction that was going on.\r\n\r\nThe royal army had succeeded in coming upon Ronda by surprise during\r\nthe absence of its alcayde and most of its garrison; but its inhabitants\r\nwere warlike and defended themselves bravely, trusting that Hamet and\r\nhis Gomeres would soon return to their assistance.\r\n\r\nThe fancied strength of their bulwarks had been of little avail against\r\nthe batteries of the besiegers. In the space of four days three towers\r\nand great masses of the walls which defended the suburbs were battered\r\ndown and the suburbs taken and plundered. Lombards and other heavy\r\nordnance were now levelled at the walls of the city, and stones and\r\nmissiles of all kinds hurled into the streets. The very rock on\r\nwhich the city stood shook with the thunder of the artillery, and the\r\nChristian captives, deep within its dungeons, hailed the sound as a\r\npromise of deliverance.\r\n\r\nWhen Hamet el (8) Zegri beheld his city thus surrounded and assailed,\r\nhe called upon his men to follow him and cut their way through to its\r\nrelief. They proceeded stealthily through the mountains until they came\r\nto the nearest heights above the Christian camp. When night fell and\r\npart of the army was sunk in sleep, they descended the rocks, and,\r\nrushing suddenly upon the weakest part of the camp, endeavored to break\r\ntheir way through and gain the city. The camp was too strong to be\r\nforced; they were driven back to the crags of the mountains, whence\r\nthey defended themselves by showering down darts and stones upon their\r\npursuers.\r\n\r\nHamet now lit alarm-fires about the heights: his standard was joined by\r\nthe neighboring mountaineers and by troops from Malaga. Thus reinforced,\r\nhe made repeated assaults upon the Christians, cutting off all\r\nstragglers from the camp. All his attempts to force his way into the\r\ncity, however, were fruitless; many of his bravest men were slain, and\r\nhe was obliged to retreat into the fastnesses of the mountains.\r\n\r\nIn the mean while the distress of Ronda increased hourly. The marques of\r\nCadiz, having possession of the suburbs, was enabled to approach to the\r\nvery foot of the perpendicular precipice rising from the river on the\r\nsummit of which the city is built. At the foot of this rock is a living\r\nfountain of limpid water gushing into a great natural basin. A secret\r\nmine led down from within the city to this fountain by several hundred\r\nsteps cut in the solid rock. Hence the city obtained its chief supply of\r\nwater, and these steps were deeply worn by the weary feet of Christian\r\ncaptives employed in this painful labor. The marques of Cadiz discovered\r\nthis subterraneous passage, and directed his pioneers to countermine in\r\nthe side of the rock; they pierced to the shaft, and, stopping it up,\r\ndeprived the city of the benefit of this precious fountain.\r\n\r\nWhile the marques was thus pressing the siege with the generous thought\r\nof soon delivering his companions-in-arms from the Moorish dungeons,\r\nfar other were the feelings of the alcayde, Hamet el Zegri. He smote\r\nhis breast and gnashed his teeth in impotent fury as he beheld from\r\nthe mountain-cliffs the destruction of the city. Every thunder of the\r\nChristian ordnance seemed to batter against his heart. He saw tower\r\nafter tower tumbling by day, and various parts of the city in a blaze\r\nat night. “They fired not merely stones from their ordnance,” says\r\na chronicler of the times, “but likewise great balls of iron cast in\r\nmoulds, which demolished everything they struck. They threw also balls\r\nof tow steeped in pitch and oil and gunpowder, which, when once on fire,\r\nwere not to be extinguished, and which set the houses in flames. Great\r\nwas the horror of the inhabitants: they knew not where to fly for\r\nrefuge: their houses were in a blaze or shattered by the ordnance; the\r\nstreets were perilous from the falling ruins and the bounding balls,\r\nwhich dashed to pieces everything they encountered. At night the city\r\nlooked like a fiery furnace; the cries and wailings of the women between\r\nthe thunders of the ordnance reached even to the Moors on the opposite\r\nmountains, who answered them by yells of fury and despair.”\r\n\r\nAll hope of external succor being at an end, the inhabitants of Ronda\r\nwere compelled to capitulate. Ferdinand was easily prevailed upon to\r\ngrant them favorable terms. The place was capable of longer resistance,\r\nand he feared for the safety of his camp, as the forces were daily\r\naugmenting on the mountains and making frequent assaults. The\r\ninhabitants were permitted to depart with their effects, either to\r\nBarbary, Granada, or elsewhere, and those who chose to reside in Spain\r\nhad lands assigned them and were indulged in the practice of their\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did the place surrender than detachments were sent to attack\r\nthe Moors who hovered about the neighboring mountains. Hamet el Zegri,\r\nhowever, did not remain to make a fruitless battle. He gave up the game\r\nas lost, and retreated with his Gomeres, filled with grief and rage, but\r\ntrusting to fortune to give him future vengeance.\r\n\r\nThe first care of the good marques of Cadiz on entering Ronda was to\r\ndeliver his unfortunate companion-in-arms from the dungeons of the\r\nfortress. What a difference in their looks from the time when, flushed\r\nwith health and hope and arrayed in military pomp, they had sallied\r\nforth upon the mountain-foray! Many of them were almost naked, with\r\nirons at their ankles and beards reaching to their waists. Their meeting\r\nwith the marques was joyful, yet it had the look of grief, for their joy\r\nwas mingled with many bitter recollections. There was an immense number\r\nof other captives, among whom were several young men of noble families\r\nwho with filial piety had surrendered themselves prisoners in place of\r\ntheir fathers.\r\n\r\nThe captives were all provided with mules and sent to the queen at\r\nCordova. The humane heart of Isabella melted at the sight of the piteous\r\ncavalcade. They were all supplied by her with food and raiment, and\r\nmoney to pay their expenses to their homes. Their chains were hung as\r\npious trophies against the exterior of the church of St. Juan de los\r\nReyes in Toledo, where the Christian traveller may regale his eyes with\r\nthe sight of them at this very day.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Seen by the author in 1826.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the Moorish captives was a young infidel maiden, of great beauty,\r\nwho desired to become a Christian and to remain in Spain. She had been\r\ninspired with the light of the true faith through the ministry of a\r\nyoung man who had been a captive in Ronda. He was anxious to complete\r\nhis good work by marrying her. The queen consented to their pious\r\nwishes, having first taken care that the young maiden should be properly\r\npurified by the holy sacrament of baptism.\r\n\r\n“Thus this pestilent nest of warfare and infidelity, the city of Ronda,”\r\n says the worthy Fray Antonio Agapida, “was converted to the true faith\r\nby the thunder of our artillery--an example which was soon followed by\r\nCazarabonela, Marbella, and other towns in these parts, insomuch that\r\nin the course of this expedition no less than seventy-two places were\r\nrescued from the vile sect of Mahomet and placed under the benignant\r\ndomination of the Cross.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nHOW THE PEOPLE OF GRANADA INVITED EL ZAGAL TO THE THRONE, AND HOW HE\r\nMARCHED TO THE CAPITAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe people of Granada were a versatile, unsteady race, and exceedingly\r\ngiven to make and unmake kings. They had for a long time vacillated\r\nbetween old Muley Abul Hassan and his son, Boabdil el Chico, sometimes\r\nsetting up the one, sometimes the other, and sometimes both at once,\r\naccording to the pinch and pressure of external evils. They found,\r\nhowever, that the evils still went on increasing in defiance of every\r\nchange, and were at their wits’ end to devise some new combination or\r\narrangement by which an efficient government might be wrought out of\r\ntwo bad kings. When the tidings arrived of the fall of Ronda, and the\r\nconsequent ruin of the frontier, a tumultuous assemblage took place\r\nin one of the public squares. As usual, the people attributed the\r\nmisfortunes of the country to the faults of their rulers, for the\r\npopulace never imagine that any part of their miseries can originate\r\nwith themselves. A crafty alfaqui, named Alyme Mazer, who had watched\r\nthe current of their discontents, rose and harangued them. “You have\r\nbeen choosing and changing,” said he, “between two monarchs; and who\r\nand what are they? Muley Abul Hassan for one, a man worn out by age and\r\ninfirmities, unable to sally forth against the foe, even when ravaging\r\nto the very gates of the city; and Boabdil el Chico for the other, an\r\napostate, a traitor, a deserter from his throne, a fugitive among the\r\nenemies of his nation, a man fated to misfortune, and proverbially named\r\n‘the Unlucky.’ In a time of overwhelming war like the present he only is\r\nfit to sway a sceptre who can wield a sword. Would you seek such a\r\nman? You need not look far. Allah has sent such a one in this time of\r\ndistress to retrieve the fortunes of Granada. You already know whom I\r\nmean. You know that it can be no other than your general, the invincible\r\nAbdallah, whose surname of El Zagal has become a watchword in battle\r\nrousing the courage of the faithful and striking terror into the\r\nunbelievers.”\r\n\r\nThe multitude received the words of the alfaqui with acclamations; they\r\nwere delighted with the idea of a third king over Granada, and Abdallah\r\nel Zagal being of the royal family, and already in the virtual exercise\r\nof royal power, the measure had nothing in it that appeared either\r\nrash or violent. A deputation was therefore sent to El Zagal at Malaga\r\ninviting him to repair to Granada to receive the crown.\r\n\r\nEl Zagal expressed great surprise and repugnance when the mission was\r\nannounced to him, and nothing but his patriotic zeal for the public\r\nsafety and his fraternal eagerness to relieve the aged Abul Hassan from\r\nthe cares of government prevailed upon him to accept the offer. Leaving,\r\ntherefore, Reduan Vanegas, one of the bravest Moorish generals, in\r\ncommand of Malaga, he departed for Granada, attended by three hundred\r\ntrusty cavaliers.\r\n\r\nMuley Abul Hassan did not wait for the arrival of his brother. Unable\r\nany longer to buffet with the storms of the times, his only solicitude\r\nwas to seek some safe and quiet harbor of repose. In one of the deep\r\nvalleys which indent the Mediterranean coast, and which are shut up\r\non the land side by stupendous mountains, stood the little city of\r\nAlmunecar. The valley was watered by the limpid river Frio, and abounded\r\nwith fruits, with grain, and pasturage. The city was strongly fortified,\r\nand the garrison and alcayde were devoted to the old monarch. This was\r\nthe place chosen by Muley Abul Hassan for his asylum. His first care\r\nwas to send thither all his treasures; his next care was to take refuge\r\nthere himself; his third, that his sultana Zoraya and their two sons\r\nshould follow him.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, Muley Abdallah el Zagal pursued his journey toward the\r\ncapital, attended by his three hundred cavaliers. The road from Malaga\r\nto Granada winds close by Alhama, and is dominated by that lofty\r\nfortress. This had been a most perilous pass for the Moors during the\r\ntime that Alhama was commanded by the count de Tendilla: not a traveller\r\ncould escape his eagle eye, and his garrison was ever ready for a sally.\r\nThe count de Tendilla, however, had been relieved from this arduous\r\npost, and it had been given in charge to Don Gutiere de Padilla, clavero\r\n(or treasurer) of the order of Calatrava--an easy, indulgent man, who\r\nhad with him three hundred gallant knights of his order, besides\r\nother mercenary troops. The garrison had fallen off in discipline; the\r\ncavaliers were hardy in fight and daring in foray, but confident in\r\nthemselves and negligent of proper precautions. Just before the journey\r\nof El Zagal a number of these cavaliers, with several soldiers of\r\nfortune of the garrison, in all about one hundred and seventy men,\r\nhad sallied forth to harass the Moorish country during its present\r\ndistracted state, and, having ravaged the valleys of the Sierra Nevada,\r\nor Snowy Mountains, were returning to Alhama in gay spirits and laden\r\nwith booty.\r\n\r\nAs El Zagal passed through the neighborhood of Alhama he recollected\r\nthe ancient perils of the road, and sent light cerradors in advance to\r\ninspect each rock and ravine where a foe might lurk in ambush. One of\r\nthese scouts, overlooking a narrow valley which opened upon the road,\r\ndescried a troop of horsemen on the banks of a little stream. They were\r\ndismounted, and had taken the bridles from their steeds, that they\r\nmight crop the fresh grass on the banks of the river. The horsemen were\r\nscattered about, some reposing in the shades of rocks and trees, others\r\ngambling for the spoil they had taken: not a sentinel was posted to\r\nkeep guard; everything showed the perfect security of men who consider\r\nthemselves beyond the reach of danger.\r\n\r\nThese careless cavaliers were in fact the knights of Calatrava\r\nreturning from their foray. A part of their force had passed on with\r\nthe cavalgada; ninety of the principal cavaliers had halted to refresh\r\nthemselves in this valley. El Zagal smiled with ferocious joy when he\r\nheard of their negligent security. “Here will be trophies,” said he, “to\r\ngrace our entrance into Granada.”\r\n\r\nApproaching the valley with cautious silence, he wheeled into it at full\r\nspeed at the head of his troop, and attacked the Christians so suddenly\r\nthat they had no time to put the bridles upon their horses or even\r\nto leap into the saddles. They made a confused but valiant defence,\r\nfighting among the rocks and in the rugged bed of the river. Their\r\ndefence was useless; seventy-nine were slain, and the remaining eleven\r\nwere taken prisoners.\r\n\r\nA party of the Moors galloped in pursuit of the cavalgada: they soon\r\novertook it winding slowly up a hill. The horsemen who convoyed it,\r\nperceiving the enemy at a distance, made their escape, and left the\r\nspoil to be retaken by the Moors. El Zagal gathered together his\r\ncaptives and his booty, and proceeded, elate with success, to Granada.\r\n\r\nHe paused before the gate of Elvira, for as yet he had not been\r\nproclaimed king. This ceremony was immediately performed, for the fame\r\nof his recent exploit had preceded him and intoxicated the minds of\r\nthe giddy populace. He entered Granada in a sort of triumph. The eleven\r\ncaptive knights of Calatrava walked in front: next were paraded the\r\nninety captured steeds, bearing the armor and weapons of their late\r\nowners, and led by as many mounted Moors: then came seventy Moorish\r\nhorsemen, with as many Christian heads hanging at their saddle-bows:\r\nMuley Abdallah followed, surrounded by a number of distinguished\r\ncavaliers splendidly attired, and the pageant was closed by a long\r\ncavalgada of the flocks and herds and other booty recovered from the\r\nChristians.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Zurita, lib. 20, c. 62; Mariana, Hist. de Espana; Abarca, Anales\r\nde Aragon.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe populace gazed with almost savage triumph at these captive cavaliers\r\nand the gory heads of their companions, knowing them to have been part\r\nof the formidable garrison of Alhama, so long the scourge of Granada and\r\nthe terror of the Vega. They hailed this petty triumph as an auspicious\r\nopening of the reign of their new monarch; for several days the name\r\nof Muley Abul Hassan and Boabdil el Chico were never mentioned but with\r\ncontempt, and the whole city resounded with the praises of El Zagal, or\r\nthe Valiant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nHOW THE COUNT DE CABRA ATTEMPTED TO CAPTURE ANOTHER KING, AND HOW HE\r\nFARED IN HIS ATTEMPT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe elevation of a bold and active veteran to the throne of Granada in\r\nplace of its late bedridden king made an important difference in\r\nthe aspect of the war, and called for some blow that should dash the\r\nconfidence of the Moors in their new monarch and animate the Christians\r\nto fresh exertions.\r\n\r\nDon Diego de Cordova, the brave count de Cabra, was at this time in his\r\ncastle of Vaena, where he kept a wary eye upon the frontier. It was now\r\nthe latter part of August, and he grieved that the summer should pass\r\naway without an inroad into the country of the foe. He sent out his\r\nscouts on the prowl, and they brought him word that the important\r\npost of Moclin was but weakly garrisoned. This was a castellated town,\r\nstrongly situated upon a high mountain, partly surrounded by thick\r\nforests and partly girdled by a river. It defended one of the rugged and\r\nsolitary passes by which the Christians were wont to make their inroads,\r\ninsomuch that the Moors, in their figurative way, denominated it the\r\nshield of Granada.\r\n\r\nThe count de Cabra sent word to the monarchs of the feeble state of\r\nthe garrison, and gave it as his opinion that by a secret and rapid\r\nexpedition the place might be surprised. King Ferdinand asked the advice\r\nof his councillors. Some cautioned him against the sanguine temperament\r\nof the count and his heedlessness of danger: Moclin, they observed, was\r\nnear to Granada and might be promptly reinforced. The opinion of the\r\ncount, however, prevailed, the king considering him almost infallible in\r\nmatters of border warfare since his capture of Boabdil el Chico.\r\n\r\nThe king departed, therefore, from Cordova, and took post at Alcala la\r\nReal, for the purpose of being near to Moclin. The queen also proceeded\r\nto Vaena, accompanied by her children, Prince Juan and the princess\r\nIsabella, and her great counsellor in all matters, public and private,\r\nspiritual and temporal, the venerable grand cardinal of Spain.\r\n\r\nNothing could exceed the pride and satisfaction of the loyal count\r\nde Cabra when he saw the stately train winding along the dreary\r\nmountain-roads and entering the gates of Vaena. He received his royal\r\nguests with all due ceremony, and lodged them in the best apartments\r\nthat the warrior castle afforded.\r\n\r\nKing Ferdinand had concerted a wary plan to ensure the success of the\r\nenterprise. The count de Cabra and Don Martin Alonso de Montemayor were\r\nto set forth with their troops so as to reach Moclin by a certain hour,\r\nand to intercept all who should attempt to enter or should sally from\r\nthe town. The master of Calatrava, the troops of the grand cardinal,\r\ncommanded by the count of Buendia, and the forces of the bishop of Jaen,\r\nled by that belligerent prelate, amounting in all to four thousand horse\r\nand six thousand foot, were to set off in time to co-operate with the\r\ncount de Cabra, so as to surround the town. The king was to follow with\r\nhis whole force and encamp before the place.\r\n\r\nAnd here the worthy padre Fray Antonio Agapida breaks forth into a\r\ntriumphant eulogy of the pious prelates who thus mingled personally\r\nin these scenes of warfare. As this was a holy crusade (says he),\r\nundertaken for the advancement of the faith and the glory of the\r\nChurch, so was it always countenanced and upheld by saintly men; for the\r\nvictories of their most Catholic majesties were not followed, like\r\nthose of mere worldly sovereigns, by erecting castles and towers and\r\nappointing alcaydes and garrisons, but by the founding of convents and\r\ncathedrals and the establishment of wealthy bishoprics. Wherefore their\r\nmajesties were always surrounded in court or camp, in the cabinet or\r\nin the field, by a crowd of ghostly advisers inspiriting them to the\r\nprosecution of this most righteous war. Nay, the holy men of the Church\r\ndid not scruple, at times, to buckle on the cuirass over the cassock,\r\nto exchange the crosier for the lance, and thus with corporal hands and\r\ntemporal weapons to fight the good fight of the faith.\r\n\r\nBut to return from this rhapsody of the worthy friar. The count de\r\nCabra, being instructed in the complicated arrangements of the king,\r\nmarched forth at midnight to execute them punctually. He led his troops\r\nby the little river that winds below Vaena, and so up to the wild\r\ndefiles of the mountains, marching all night, and stopping only in the\r\nheat of the following day to repose under the shadowy cliffs of a deep\r\nbarranca, calculating to arrive at Moclin exactly in time to co-operate\r\nwith the other forces.\r\n\r\nThe troops had scarcely stretched themselves on the earth to take\r\nrepose, when a scout arrived bringing word that El Zagal had suddenly\r\nsallied out of Granada with a strong force, and had encamped in the\r\nvicinity of Moclin. It was plain that the wary Moor had received\r\ninformation of the intended attack. This, however, was not the idea that\r\npresented itself to the mind of the count de Cabra. He had captured one\r\nking; here was a fair opportunity to secure another. What a prisoner to\r\ndeliver into the hands of his royal mistress! Fired with the thoughts,\r\nthe good count forgot all the arrangements of the king; or rather,\r\nblinded by former success, he trusted everything to courage and fortune,\r\nand thought that by one bold swoop he might again bear off the royal\r\nprize and wear his laurels without competition.* His only fear was that\r\nthe master of Calatrava and the belligerent bishop might come up in time\r\nto share the glory of the victory; so, ordering every one to horse, this\r\nhot-spirited cavalier pushed on for Moclin without allowing his troops\r\nthe necessary time for repose.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Mariana, lib. 25, c. 17; Abarca, Zurita, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evening closed as the count arrived in the neighborhood of Moclin.\r\nIt was the full of the moon and a bright and cloudless night. The count\r\nwas marching through one of those deep valleys or ravines worn in the\r\nSpanish mountains by the brief but tremendous torrents which prevail\r\nduring the autumnal rains. It was walled on each side by lofty and\r\nalmost perpendicular cliffs, but great masses of moonlight were thrown\r\ninto the bottom of the glen, glittering on the armor of the shining\r\nsquadrons as they silently passed through it. Suddenly the war-cry of\r\nthe Moors rose in various parts of the valley. “El Zagal! El Zagal!” was\r\nshouted from every cliff, accompanied by showers of missiles that struck\r\ndown several of the Christian warriors. The count lifted up his eyes,\r\nand beheld, by the light of the moon, every cliff glistening with\r\nMoorish soldiery. The deadly shower fell thickly round him, and the\r\nshining armor of his followers made them fair objects for the aim of the\r\nenemy. The count saw his brother Gonzalo struck dead by his side;\r\nhis own horse sank under him, pierced by four Moorish lances, and\r\nhe received a wound in the hand from an arquebuse. He remembered the\r\nhorrible massacre of the mountains of Malaga, and feared a similar\r\ncatastrophe. There was no time to pause. His brother’s horse, freed\r\nfrom his slaughtered rider, was running at large: seizing the reins, he\r\nsprang into the saddle, called upon his men to follow him, and, wheeling\r\nround, retreated out of the fatal valley.\r\n\r\nThe Moors, rushing down from the heights, pursued the retreating\r\nChristians. The chase endured for a league, but it was a league of rough\r\nand broken road, where the Christians had to turn and fight at almost\r\nevery step. In these short but fierce combats the enemy lost many\r\ncavaliers of note, but the loss of the Christians was infinitely more\r\ngrievous, comprising numbers of the noblest warriors of Vaena and its\r\nvicinity. Many of the Christians, disabled by wounds or exhausted by\r\nfatigue, turned aside and endeavored to conceal themselves among rocks\r\nand thickets, but never more rejoined their companions, being slain or\r\ncaptured by the Moors or perishing in their wretched retreats.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the troops led by the master of Calatrava and the bishop\r\nof Jaen put an end to the rout. El Zagal contented himself with the\r\nlaurels he had gained, and, ordering the trumpets to call off his men\r\nfrom the pursuit, returned in great triumph to Moclin.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Zurita, lib. 20, c. 4; Pulgar, Cronica.\r\n\r\n\r\nQueen Isabella was at Vaena, awaiting with great anxiety the result of\r\nthe expedition. She was in a stately apartment of the castle looking\r\ntoward the road that winds through the mountains from Moclin, and\r\nregarding the watch-towers on the neighboring heights in hopes of\r\nfavorable signals. The prince and princess, her children, were with\r\nher, and her venerable counsellor, the grand cardinal. All shared in the\r\nanxiety of the moment. At length couriers were seen riding toward the\r\ntown. They entered its gates, but before they reached the castle the\r\nnature of their tidings was known to the queen by the shrieks and\r\nwailings from the streets below. The messengers were soon followed by\r\nwounded fugitives hastening home to be relieved or to die among their\r\nfriends and families. The whole town resounded with lamentations, for it\r\nhad lost the flower of its youth and its bravest warriors. Isabella\r\nwas a woman of courageous soul, but her feelings were overpowered by\r\nspectacles of woe on every side: her maternal heart mourned over the\r\ndeath of so many loyal subjects, who shortly before had rallied round\r\nher with devoted affection, and, losing her usual self-command, she sank\r\ninto deep despondency.\r\n\r\nIn this gloomy state of mind a thousand apprehensions crowded upon her.\r\nShe dreaded the confidence which this success would impart to the Moors;\r\nshe feared also for the important fortress of Alhama, the garrison of\r\nwhich had not been reinforced since its foraging party had been cut off\r\nby this same El Zagal. On every side she saw danger and disaster, and\r\nfeared that a general reverse was about to attend the Castilian arms.\r\n\r\nThe grand cardinal comforted her with both spiritual and worldly\r\ncounsel. He told her to recollect that no country was ever conquered\r\nwithout occasional reverses to the conquerors; that the Moors were a\r\nwarlike people, fortified in a rough and mountainous country, where they\r\nnever could be conquered by her ancestors; and that, in fact, her armies\r\nhad already, in three years, taken more cities than those of any of her\r\npredecessors had been able to do in twelve. He concluded by offering to\r\ntake the field himself with three thousand cavalry, his own retainers,\r\npaid and maintained by himself, and either hasten to the relief of\r\nAlhama or undertake any other expedition Her Majesty might command.\r\nThe discreet words of the cardinal soothed the spirit of the queen, who\r\nalways looked to him for consolation, and she soon recovered her usual\r\nequanimity.\r\n\r\nSome of the counsellors of Isabella, of that politic class who seek\r\nto rise by the faults of others, were loud in their censures of the\r\nrashness of the count. The queen defended him with prompt generosity.\r\n“The enterprise,” said she, “was rash, but not more rash than that of\r\nLucena, which was crowned with success, and which we have all applauded\r\nas the height of heroism. Had the count de Cabra succeeded in capturing\r\nthe uncle, as he did the nephew, who is there that would not have\r\npraised him to the skies?”\r\n\r\nThe magnanimous words of the queen put a stop to all invidious remarks\r\nin her presence, but certain of the courtiers, who had envied the count\r\nthe glory gained by his former achievements, continued to magnify,\r\namong themselves his present imprudence; and we are told by Fray Antonio\r\nAgapida that they sneeringly gave the worthy cavalier the appellation of\r\ncount de Cabra the king-catcher.\r\n\r\nFerdinand had reached the place on the frontier called the Fountain\r\nof the King, within three leagues of Moclin, when he heard of the\r\nlate disaster. He greatly lamented the precipitation of the count, but\r\nforbore to express himself with severity, for he knew the value of that\r\nloyal and valiant cavalier.* He held a council of war to determine what\r\ncourse was to be pursued. Some of his cavaliers advised him to abandon\r\nthe attempt upon Moclin, the place being strongly reinforced and the\r\nenemy inspirited by his recent victory. Certain old Spanish hidalgos\r\nreminded him that he had but few Castilian troops in his army, without\r\nwhich stanch soldiery his predecessors never presumed to enter the\r\nMoorish territory, while others remonstrated that it would be beneath\r\nthe dignity of the king to retire from an enterprise on account of the\r\ndefeat of a single cavalier and his retainers. In this way the king was\r\ndistracted by a multitude of counsellors, when, fortunately, a letter\r\nfrom the queen put an end to his perplexities. Proceed we in the next\r\nchapter to relate what was the purport of that letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Abarca, Anales de Aragon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nEXPEDITION AGAINST THE CASTLES OF CAMBIL AND ALBAHAR.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Happy are those princes,” exclaims the worthy padre Fray Antonio\r\nAgapida, “who have women and priests to advise them, for in these\r\ndwelleth the spirit of counsel.” While Ferdinand and his captains were\r\nconfounding each other in their deliberations at the Fountain of the\r\nKing, a quiet but deep little council of war was held in the state\r\napartment of the old castle of Vaena between Queen Isabella, the\r\nvenerable Pedro Gonzalez de Mendoza, grand cardinal of Spain, and Don\r\nGarcia Osoria, the belligerent bishop of Jaen. This last worthy prelate,\r\nwho had exchanged his mitre for a helm, no sooner beheld the defeat of\r\nthe enterprise against Moclin than he turned the reins of his sleek,\r\nstall-fed steed and hastened back to Vaena, full of a project for the\r\nemployment of the army, the advancement of the faith, and the benefit of\r\nhis own diocese. He knew that the actions of the king were influenced\r\nby the opinions of the queen, and that the queen always inclined\r\na listening ear to the counsels of saintly men: he laid his plans,\r\ntherefore, with the customary wisdom of his cloth, to turn the ideas\r\nof the queen into the proper channel; and this was the purport of the\r\nworthy bishop’s suggestions:\r\n\r\nThe bishopric of Jaen had for a long time been harassed by two Moorish\r\ncastles, the scourge and terror of all that part of the country. They\r\nwere situated on the frontiers of the kingdom of Granada, about four\r\nleagues from Jaen, in a deep, narrow, and rugged valley surrounded by\r\nlofty mountains. Through this valley runs the Rio Frio (or Cold River)\r\nin a deep channel worn between high, precipitous banks. On each side of\r\nthe stream rise two vast rocks, nearly perpendicular, within a stone’s\r\nthrow of each other, blocking up the gorge of the valley. On the summits\r\nof these rocks stood the two formidable castles, Cambil and Albahar,\r\nfortified with battlements and towers of great height and thickness.\r\nThey were connected together by a bridge thrown from rock to rock across\r\nthe river. The road which passed through the valley traversed this\r\nbridge, and was completely commanded by these castles. They stood like\r\ntwo giants of romance guarding the pass and dominating the valley.\r\n\r\nThe kings of Granada, knowing the importance of these castles, kept\r\nthem always well garrisoned and victualled to stand a siege, with fleet\r\nsteeds and hard riders to forage the country of the Christians. The\r\nwarlike race of the Abencerrages, the troops of the royal household, and\r\nothers of the choicest chivalry of Granada made them their strongholds\r\nor posts of arms, whence to sally forth on those predatory and roving\r\nenterprises in which they delighted. As the wealthy bishopric of\r\nJaen lay immediately at hand, it suffered more peculiarly from these\r\nmarauders. They drove off the fat beeves and the flocks of sheep from\r\nthe pastures and swept the laborers from the field; they scoured the\r\ncountry to the very gates of Jaen, so that the citizens could not\r\nventure from their walls without the risk of being borne off captive to\r\nthe dungeons of these castles.\r\n\r\nThe worthy bishop, like a good pastor, beheld with grief of heart his\r\nfat bishopric daily waxing leaner and leaner and poorer and poorer, and\r\nhis holy ire was kindled at the thoughts that the possessions of the\r\nChurch should thus be at the mercy of a crew of infidels. It was the\r\nurgent counsel of the bishop, therefore, that the military force thus\r\nprovidentially assembled in the neighborhood, since it was apparently\r\nfoiled in its attempt upon Moclin, should be turned against these\r\ninsolent castles and the country delivered from their domination. The\r\ngrand cardinal supported the suggestion of the bishop, and declared that\r\nhe had long meditated the policy of a measure of the kind. Their united\r\nopinions found favor with the queen, and she despatched a letter on\r\nthe subject to the king. It came just in time to relieve him from the\r\ndistraction of a multitude of counsellors, and he immediately undertook\r\nthe reduction of those castles.\r\n\r\nThe marques of Cadiz was accordingly sent in advance, with two thousand\r\nhorse, to keep a watch upon the garrisons and prevent all entrance or\r\nexit until the king should arrive with the main army and the battering\r\nartillery. The queen, to be near at hand in case of need, moved her\r\nquarters to the city of Jaen, where she was received with martial honors\r\nby the belligerent bishop, who had buckled on his cuirass and girded on\r\nhis sword to fight in the cause of his diocese.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the marques of Cadiz arrived in the valley and\r\ncompletely shut up the Moors within their walls. The castles were under\r\nthe command of Mahomet Lentin Ben Usef, an Abencerrage, and one of the\r\nbravest cavaliers of Granada. In his garrisons were many troops of\r\nthe fierce African tribe of Gomeres. Mahomet Lentin, confident in\r\nthe strength of his fortresses, smiled as he looked down from his\r\nbattlements upon the Christian cavalry perplexed in the rough and narrow\r\nvalley. He sent forth skirmishing parties to harass them, and there were\r\nmany sharp combats between small parties and single knights; but the\r\nMoors were driven back to their castles, and all attempts to send\r\nintelligence of their situation to Granada were frustrated by the\r\nvigilance of the marques of Cadiz.\r\n\r\nAt length the legions of the royal army came pouring, with vaunting\r\ntrumpet and fluttering banner, along the defiles of the mountains.\r\nThey halted before the castles, but the king could not find room in\r\nthe narrow and rugged valley to form his camp; he had to divide it\r\ninto three parts, which were posted on different heights, and his tents\r\nwhitened the sides of the neighboring hills. When the encampment was\r\nformed the army remained gazing idly at the castles. The artillery was\r\nupward of four leagues in the rear, and without artillery all attack\r\nwould be in vain.\r\n\r\nThe alcayde Mahomet Lentin knew the nature of the road by which the\r\nartillery had to be brought. It was merely a narrow and rugged path, at\r\ntimes scaling almost perpendicular crags and precipices, up which it was\r\nutterly impossible for wheel carriages to pass, neither was it in\r\nthe power of man or beast to draw up the lombards and other ponderous\r\nordnance. He felt assured, therefore, that they never could be brought\r\nto the camp, and without their aid what could the Christians effect\r\nagainst his rock-built castles? He scoffed at them, therefore, as he\r\nsaw their tents by day and their fires by night covering the surrounding\r\nheights. “Let them linger here a little while longer,” said he, “and the\r\nautumnal torrents will wash them from the mountains.”\r\n\r\nWhile the alcayde was thus closely mewed up within his walls and\r\nthe Christians remained inactive in their camp, he noticed, one calm\r\nautumnal day, the sound of implements of labor echoing among the\r\nmountains, and now and then the crash of a falling tree or a thundering\r\nreport, as if some rock had been heaved from its bed and hurled into the\r\nvalley. The alcayde was on the battlements of his castle, surrounded by\r\nhis knights. “Methinks,” said he, “these Christians are making war\r\nupon the rocks and trees of the mountains, since they find our castle\r\nunassailable.”\r\n\r\nThe sounds did not cease even during the night: every now and then the\r\nMoorish sentinel as he paced the battlements heard some crash echoing\r\namong the heights. The return of day explained the mystery. Scarcely\r\ndid the sun shine against the summits of the mountains than shouts burst\r\nfrom the cliffs opposite to the castle, and were answered from the camp\r\nwith joyful sounds of kettledrums and trumpets.\r\n\r\nThe astonished Moors lifted up their eyes and beheld, as it were, a\r\ntorrent of war breaking out of a narrow defile. There was a multitude\r\nof men with pickaxes, spades, and bars of iron clearing away every\r\nobstacle, while behind them slowly moved along great teams of oxen\r\ndragging heavy ordnance and all the munitions of battering artillery.\r\n\r\n“What cannot women and priests effect when they unite in council?”\r\n exclaims again the worthy Antonio Agapida. The queen had held another\r\nconsultation with the grand cardinal and the belligerent bishop of Jaen.\r\nIt was clear that the heavy ordnance could never be conveyed to the\r\ncamp by the regular road of the country, and without battering artillery\r\nnothing could be effected. It was suggested, however, by the zealous\r\nbishop that another road might be opened through a more practicable part\r\nof the mountains. It would be an undertaking extravagant and chimerical\r\nwith ordinary means, and therefore unlooked for by the enemy; but what\r\ncould not kings effect who had treasure and armies at command?\r\n\r\nThe project struck the enterprising spirit of the queen. Six thousand\r\nmen with pickaxes, crowbars, and every other necessary implement were\r\nset to work day and night to break a road through the very centre of the\r\nmountains. No time was to be lost, for it was rumored that El Zagal\r\nwas about to march with a mighty host to the relief of the castles.\r\nThe bustling bishop of Jaen acted as pioneer to mark the route and\r\nsuperintend the laborers, and the grand cardinal took care that the work\r\nshould never languish through lack of means.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Zurita, Anales de Aragon, lib. 20, c. 64; Pulgar, part 3, cap. 51.\r\n\r\n\r\n“When kings’ treasures,” says Fray Antonio Agapida, “are dispensed by\r\npriestly hands, there is no stint, as the glorious annals of Spain\r\nbear witness.” Under the guidance of these ghostly men it seemed as if\r\nmiracles were effected. Almost an entire mountain was levelled, valleys\r\nwere filled up, trees hewn down, rocks broken and overturned; in short,\r\nall the obstacles which nature had heaped around entirely and promptly\r\nvanished. In little more than twelve days this gigantic work was\r\neffected and the ordnance dragged to the camp, to the great triumph of\r\nthe Christians and confusion of the Moors.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Zurita\r\n\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the heavy artillery arrived than it was mounted in all\r\nhaste upon the neighboring heights: Francisco Ramirez de Madrid, the\r\nfirst engineer in Spain, superintended the batteries, and soon opened a\r\ndestructive fire upon the castles.\r\n\r\nWhen the alcayde, Mahomet Lentin, found his towers tumbling about\r\nhim and his bravest men dashed from the walls without the power\r\nof inflicting a wound upon the foe, his haughty spirit was greatly\r\nexasperated. “Of what avail,” said he, bitterly, “is all the prowess of\r\nknighthood against these cowardly engines that murder from afar?”\r\n\r\nFor a whole day a tremendous fire kept thundering upon the castle of\r\nAlbahar. The lombards discharged large stones which demolished two of\r\nthe towers and all the battlements which guarded the portal. If any\r\nMoors attempted to defend the walls or repair the breaches, they were\r\nshot down by ribadoquines and other small pieces of artillery. The\r\nChristian soldiery issued from the camp under cover of this fire, and,\r\napproaching the castles, discharged flights of arrows and stones through\r\nthe openings made by the ordnance.\r\n\r\nAt length, to bring the siege to a conclusion, Francisco Ramirez\r\nelevated some of the heaviest artillery on a mount that rose in form of\r\na cone or pyramid on the side of the river near to Albahar and commanded\r\nboth castles. This was an operation of great skill and excessive labor,\r\nbut it was repaid by complete success, for the Moors did not dare to\r\nwait until this terrible battery should discharge its fury. Satisfied\r\nthat all further resistance was in vain, the valiant alcayde made signal\r\nfor a parley. The articles of capitulation were soon arranged. The\r\nalcayde and his garrisons were permitted to return in safety to the city\r\nof Granada, and the castles were delivered into the possession of King\r\nFerdinand on the day of the festival of St. Matthew in the month of\r\nSeptember. They were immediately repaired, strongly garrisoned, and\r\ndelivered in charge to the city of Jaen.\r\n\r\nThe effects of this triumph were immediately apparent. Quiet and\r\nsecurity once more settled upon the bishopric. The husbandmen tilled\r\ntheir fields in peace, the herds and flocks fattened unmolested in the\r\npastures, and the vineyards yielded corpulent skinsful of rosy wine. The\r\ngood bishop enjoyed in the gratitude of his people the approbation of\r\nhis conscience, the increase of his revenues, and the abundance of his\r\ntable a reward for all his toils and perils. “This glorious victory,”\r\n exclaims Fray Antonio Agapida, “achieved by such extraordinary\r\nmanagement and infinite labor, is a shining example of what a bishop can\r\neffect for the promotion of the faith and the good of his diocese.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nENTERPRISE OF THE KNIGHTS OF CALATRAVA AGAINST ZALEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile these events were taking place on the northern frontier of the\r\nkingdom of Granada the important fortress of Alhama was neglected, and\r\nits commander, Don Gutiere de Padilla, clavero of Calatrava, reduced\r\nto great perplexity. The remnant of the foraging party which had been\r\nsurprised and massacred by El Zagal when on his way to Granada to\r\nreceive the crown had returned in confusion and dismay to the fortress.\r\nThey could only speak of their own disgrace, being obliged to abandon\r\ntheir cavalgada and fly, pursued by a superior force: of the flower of\r\ntheir party, the gallant knights of Calatrava, who had remained behind\r\nin the valley, they knew nothing. A few days cleared up the mystery of\r\ntheir fate: tidings were brought that their bloody heads had been borne\r\nin triumph into Granada. The surviving knights of Calatrava, who formed\r\na part of the garrison, burned to revenge the death of their comrades\r\nand to wipe out the stigma of this defeat; but the clavero had been\r\nrendered cautious by disaster--he resisted all their entreaties for a\r\nforay. His garrison was weakened by the loss of so many of its bravest\r\nmen; the Vega was patrolled by numerous and powerful squadrons sent\r\nforth by El Zagal; above all, the movements of the garrison were watched\r\nby the warriors of Zalea, a strong town only two leagues distant on the\r\nroad toward Loxa. This place was a continual check upon Alhama when\r\nin its most powerful state, placing ambuscades to entrap the Christian\r\ncavaliers in the course of their sallies. Frequent and bloody skirmishes\r\nhad taken place in consequence; and the troops of Alhama, when returning\r\nfrom their forays, had often to fight their way back through the\r\nsquadrons of Zalea. Thus surrounded by dangers, Don Gutiere de Padilla\r\nrestrained the eagerness of his troops for a sally, knowing that an\r\nadditional disaster might be followed by the loss of Alhama.\r\n\r\nIn the mean while provisions began to grow scarce; they were unable to\r\nforage the country as usual for supplies, and depended for relief upon\r\nthe Castilian sovereigns. The defeat of the count de Cabra filled\r\nthe measure of their perplexities, as it interrupted the intended\r\nreinforcements and supplies. To such extremity were they reduced that\r\nthey were compelled to kill some of their horses for provisions.\r\n\r\nThe worthy clavero, Don Gutiere de Padilla, was pondering one day on\r\nthis gloomy state of affairs when a Moor was brought before him who had\r\nsurrendered himself at the gate of Alhama and claimed an audience. Don\r\nGutiere was accustomed to visits of the kind from renegado Moors, who\r\nroamed the country as spies and adalides, but the countenance of this\r\nman was quite unknown to him. He had a box strapped to his shoulders\r\ncontaining divers articles of traffic, and appeared to be one of those\r\nitinerant traders who often resorted to Alhama and the other garrison\r\ntowns under pretext of vending trivial merchandise, such as amulets,\r\nperfumes, and trinkets, but who often produced rich shawls, golden\r\nchains and necklaces, and valuable gems and jewels.\r\n\r\nThe Moor requested a private conference with the clavero. “I have a\r\nprecious jewel,” said he, “to dispose of.”\r\n\r\n“I want no jewels,” replied Don Gutiere.\r\n\r\n“For the sake of Him who died on the cross, the great prophet of your\r\nfaith,” said the Moor solemnly, “refuse not my request; the jewel\r\nI speak of you alone can purchase, but I can only treat about it in\r\nsecret.”\r\n\r\nDon Gutiere perceived there was something hidden under these mystic and\r\nfigurative terms, in which the Moors were often accustomed to talk.\r\nHe motioned to his attendants to retire. When they were alone the Moor\r\nlooked cautiously around the apartment, and then, approaching close to\r\nthe knight, demanded in a low voice, “What will you give me if I deliver\r\nthe fortress of Zalea into your hands?”\r\n\r\nDon Gutiere looked with surprise at the humble individual that made such\r\na suggestion.\r\n\r\n“What means have you,” said he, “of effecting such a proposition?”\r\n\r\n“I have a brother in the garrison of Zalea,” replied the Moor, “who for\r\na proper compensation would admit a body of troops into the citadel.”\r\n\r\nDon Gutiere turned a scrutinizing eye upon the Moor. “What right have\r\nI to believe,” said he, “that thou wilt be truer to me than to those of\r\nthy blood and thy religion?”\r\n\r\n“I renounce all ties to them, either of blood or religion,” replied the\r\nMoor; “my mother was a Christian captive; her country shall henceforth\r\nbe my country, and her faith my faith.” *\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Cura de los Palacios.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe doubts of Don Gutiere were not dispelled by this profession of\r\nmongrel Christianity. “Granting the sincerity of thy conversion,” said\r\nhe, “art thou under no obligations of gratitude or duty to the alcayde\r\nof the fortress thou wouldst betray?”\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the Moor flashed fire at the words; he gnashed his teeth\r\nwith fury. “The alcayde,” cried he, “is a dog! He has deprived my\r\nbrother of his just share of booty; he has robbed me of my merchandise,\r\ntreated me worse than a Jew when I murmured at his injustice, and\r\nordered me to be thrust forth ignominiously from his walls. May the\r\ncurse of God fall upon my head if I rest content until I have full\r\nrevenge!” “Enough,” said Don Gutiere: “I trust more to thy revenge than\r\nthy religion.”\r\n\r\nThe good clavero called a council of his officers. The knights of\r\nCalatrava were unanimous for the enterprise--zealous to appease the\r\nmanes of their slaughtered comrades. Don Gutiere reminded them of\r\nthe state of the garrison, enfeebled by their late loss and scarcely\r\nsufficient for the defence of the walls. The cavaliers replied that\r\nthere was no achievement without risk, and that there would have been\r\nno great actions recorded in history had there not been daring spirits\r\nready to peril life to gain renown.\r\n\r\nDon Gutiere yielded to the wishes of his knights, for to have resisted\r\nany further might have drawn on him the imputation of timidity: he\r\nascertained by trusty spies that everything in Zalea remained in the\r\nusual state, and he made all the requisite arrangements for the attack.\r\n\r\nWhen the appointed night arrived all the cavaliers were anxious to\r\nengage in the enterprise, but the individuals were decided by lot. They\r\nset out under the guidance of the Moor, and when they had arrived in the\r\nvicinity of Zalea they bound his hands behind his back, and their\r\nleader pledged his knightly word to strike him dead on the first sign of\r\ntreachery. He then bade him to lead the way.\r\n\r\nIt was near midnight when they reached the walls of the fortress. They\r\npassed silently along until they found themselves below the citadel.\r\nHere their guide made a low and preconcerted signal: it was answered\r\nfrom above, and a cord let down from the wall. The knights attached\r\nto it a ladder, which was drawn up and fastened. Gutiere Munoz was the\r\nfirst that mounted, followed by Pedro de Alvarado, both brave and hardy\r\nsoldiers. A handful succeeded: they were attacked by a party of guards,\r\nbut held them at bay until more of their comrades ascended; with their\r\nassistance they gained possession of a tower and part of the wall. The\r\ngarrison by this time was aroused, but before they could reach the scene\r\nof action most of the cavaliers were within the battlements. A bloody\r\ncontest raged for about an hour--several of the Christians were slain,\r\nbut many of the Moors: at length the citadel was carried and the town\r\nsubmitted without resistance.\r\n\r\nThus did the gallant knights of Calatrava gain the strong town of Zalea\r\nwith scarcely any loss, and atone for the inglorious defeat of their\r\ncompanions by El Zagal. They found the magazines of the place well\r\nstored with provisions, and were enabled to carry a seasonable supply to\r\ntheir own famishing garrison.\r\n\r\nThe tidings of this event reached the sovereigns just after the\r\nsurrender of Cambil and Albahar. They were greatly rejoiced at\r\nthis additional success of their arms, and immediately sent strong\r\nreinforcements and ample supplies for both Alhama and Zalea. They then\r\ndismissed the army for the winter. Ferdinand and Isabella retired to\r\nAlcala de Henares, where the queen on the 16th of December, 1485,\r\ngave birth to the princess Catharine, afterward wife of Henry VIII. of\r\nEngland. Thus prosperously terminated the checkered campaign of this\r\nimportant year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nDEATH OF MULEY ABUL HASSAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuley Abdallah el Zagal had been received with great acclamations\r\nat Granada on his return from defeating the count de Cabra. He had\r\nendeavored to turn his victory to the greatest advantage with his\r\nsubjects, giving tilts and tournaments and other public festivities in\r\nwhich the Moors delighted. The loss of the castles of Cambil and Albahar\r\nand of the fortress of Zalea, however, checked this sudden tide of\r\npopularity, and some of the fickle populace began to doubt whether they\r\nhad not been rather precipitate in deposing his brother, Muley Abul\r\nHassan.\r\n\r\nThat superannuated monarch remained in his faithful town of Almunecar,\r\non the border of the Mediterranean, surrounded by a few adherents,\r\ntogether with his wife Zoraya and his children, and he had all his\r\ntreasures safe in his possession. The fiery heart of the old king was\r\nalmost burnt out, and all his powers of doing either harm or good seemed\r\nat an end.\r\n\r\nWhile in this passive and helpless state his brother, El Zagal,\r\nmanifested a sudden anxiety for his health. He had him removed, with all\r\ntenderness and care, to Salobrena, another fortress on the Mediterranean\r\ncoast, famous for its pure and salubrious air; and the alcayde, who was\r\na devoted adherent to El Zagal, was charged to have especial care that\r\nnothing was wanting to the comfort and solace of his brother.\r\n\r\nSalobrena was a small town, situated on a lofty and rocky hill in\r\nthe midst of a beautiful and fertile vega shut up on three sides\r\nby mountains and opening on the fourth to the Mediterranean. It was\r\nprotected by strong walls and a powerful castle, and, being deemed\r\nimpregnable, was often used by the Moorish kings as a place of deposit\r\nfor their treasures. They were accustomed also to assign it as a\r\nresidence for such of their sons and brothers as might endanger the\r\nsecurity of their reign. Here the princes lived in luxurious repose:\r\nthey had delicious gardens, perfumed baths, a harem of beauties at their\r\ncommand--nothing was denied them but the liberty to depart: that alone\r\nwas wanting to render this abode an earthly paradise.\r\n\r\nSuch was the delightful place appointed by El Zagal for the residence\r\nof his brother, but, notwithstanding its wonderful salubrity, the old\r\nmonarch had not been removed thither many days before he expired. There\r\nwas nothing extraordinary in his death: life with him had long been\r\nglimmering in the socket, and for some time past he might rather have\r\nbeen numbered with the dead than with the living. The public, however,\r\nare fond of seeing things in a sinister and mysterious point of view,\r\nand there were many dark surmises as to the cause of this event. El\r\nZagal acted in a manner to heighten these suspicions: he caused the\r\ntreasures of his deceased brother to be packed on mules and brought\r\nto Granada, where he took possession of them, to the exclusion of the\r\nchildren of Abul Hassan. The sultana Zoraya and her two sons were lodged\r\nin the Alhambra, in the Tower of Comares. This was a residence in a\r\npalace, but it had proved a royal prison to the sultana Ayxa la Horra\r\nand her youthful son Boabdil. There the unhappy Zoraya had time to\r\nmeditate upon the disappointment of all those ambitious schemes for\r\nherself and children for which she had stained her conscience with so\r\nmany crimes.\r\n\r\nThe corpse of old Muley was also brought to Granada--not in state\r\nbecoming the remains of a once-powerful sovereign, but transported on\r\na mule, like the corpse of the poorest peasant. It received no honor or\r\nceremonial from El Zagal, and appears to have been interred obscurely\r\nto prevent any popular sensation; and it is recorded by an ancient and\r\nfaithful chronicler of the time that the body of the old monarch was\r\ndeposited by two Christian captives in his osario or charnel-house.*\r\nSuch was the end of the turbulent Muley Abul Hassan, who, after passing\r\nhis life in constant contests for empire, could scarce gain quiet\r\nadmission into the corner of a sepulchre.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Cura de los Palacios, c. 77.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo sooner were the populace well assured that old Muley Abul Hassan was\r\ndead and beyond recovery than they all began to extol his memory and\r\ndeplore his loss. They admitted that he had been fierce and cruel, but\r\nthen he had been brave; he had, to be sure, pulled this war upon their\r\nheads, but he had likewise been crushed by it. In a word, he was\r\ndead, and his death atoned or every fault; for a king recently dead is\r\ngenerally either a hero or a saint.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as they ceased to hate old Muley they began to hate his\r\nbrother. The circumstances of the old king’s death, the eagerness to\r\nappropriate his treasures, the scandalous neglect of his corpse, and the\r\nimprisonment of his sultana and children,--all filled the public mind\r\nwith gloomy suspicions, and the epithet of Fratricide was sometimes\r\nsubstituted for that of El Zagal in the low murmurings of the people.\r\n\r\nAs the public must always have some object to like as well as to hate,\r\nthere began once more to be an inquiry after their fugitive king,\r\nBoabdil el Chico. That unfortunate monarch was still at Cordova,\r\nexisting on the cool courtesy and meagre friendship of Ferdinand,\r\nwhich had waned exceedingly ever since Boabdil had ceased to have any\r\ninfluence in his late dominions. The reviving interest expressed in his\r\nfate by the Moorish public, and certain secret overtures made to him,\r\nonce more aroused the sympathy of Ferdinand: he advised Boabdil again to\r\nset up his standard within the frontiers of Granada, and furnished him\r\nwith money and means for the purpose. Boabdil advanced but a little way\r\ninto his late territories; he took up his post at Velez el Blanco, a\r\nstrong town on the confines of Murcia: there he established the shadow\r\nof a court, and stood, as it were, with one foot over the border,\r\nand ready to draw that back upon the least alarm. His presence in the\r\nkingdom, however, and his assumption of royal state gave life to his\r\nfaction in Granada. The inhabitants of the Albaycin, the poorest but\r\nmost warlike part of the populace, were generally in his favor: the\r\nmore rich, courtly, and aristocratical inhabitants of the quarter of the\r\nAlhambra rallied round what appeared to be the most stable authority\r\nand supported the throne of El Zagal. So it is in the admirable order\r\nof sublunary affairs: everything seeks its kind; the rich befriend the\r\nrich, the powerful stand by the powerful, the poor enjoy the patronage\r\nof the poor, and thus a universal harmony prevails.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nOF THE CHRISTIAN ARMY WHICH ASSEMBLED AT THE CITY OF CORDOVA.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat and glorious was the style with which the Catholic sovereigns\r\nopened another year’s campaign of this eventful war. It was like\r\ncommencing another act of a stately and heroic drama, where the curtain\r\nrises to the inspiring sound of martial melody and the whole stage\r\nglitters with the array of warriors and the pomp of arms. The ancient\r\ncity of Cordova was the place appointed by the sovereigns for the\r\nassemblage of the troops; and early in the spring of 1486 the fair\r\nvalley of the Guadalquivir resounded with the shrill blast of trumpet\r\nand the impatient neighing of the war-horse. In this splendid era of\r\nSpanish chivalry there was a rivalship among the nobles who most should\r\ndistinguish himself by the splendor of his appearance and the number and\r\nequipments of his feudal followers. Every day beheld some cavalier of\r\nnote, the representative of some proud and powerful house, entering the\r\ngates of Cordova with sound of trumpet, and displaying his banner and\r\ndevice renowned in many a contest. He would appear in sumptuous array,\r\nsurrounded by pages and lackeys no less gorgeously attired, and followed\r\nby a host of vassals and retainers, horse and foot, all admirably\r\nequipped in burnished armor.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of Don Inigo Lopez de Mendoza, duke of Infantado, who\r\nmay be cited as a picture of a warlike noble of those times. He brought\r\nwith him five hundred men-at-arms of his household armed and mounted\r\n“a la gineta” and “a la guisa.” The cavaliers who attended him were\r\nmagnificently armed and dressed. The housings of fifty of his horses\r\nwere of rich cloth embroidered with gold, and others were of brocade.\r\nThe sumpter mules had housings of the same, with halters of silk, while\r\nthe bridles, head-pieces, and all the harnessing glittered with silver.\r\n\r\nThe camp equipage of these noble and luxurious warriors was equally\r\nmagnificent. Their tents were gay pavilions of various colors, fitted\r\nup with silken hangings and decorated with fluttering pennons. They had\r\nvessels of gold and silver for the service of their tables, as if they\r\nwere about to engage in a course of stately feasts and courtly revels,\r\ninstead of the stern encounters of rugged and mountainous warfare.\r\nSometimes they passed through the streets of Cordova at night in\r\nsplendid cavalcade, with great numbers of lighted torches, the rays of\r\nwhich, falling upon polished armor and nodding plumes and silken\r\nscarfs and trappings of golden embroidery, filled all beholders with\r\nadmiration.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Pulgar, part 3, cap. 41, 56.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it was not the chivalry of Spain alone which thronged the streets of\r\nCordova. The fame of this war had spread throughout Christendom: it\r\nwas considered a kind of crusade, and Catholic knights from all parts\r\nhastened to signalize themselves in so holy a cause. There were several\r\nvaliant chevaliers from France, among whom the most distinguished was\r\nGaston du Leon, seneschal of Toulouse. With him came a gallant train,\r\nwell armed and mounted and decorated with rich surcoats and panaches of\r\nfeathers. These cavaliers, it is said, eclipsed all others in the light\r\nfestivities of the court: they were devoted to the fair, but not after\r\nthe solemn and passionate manner of the Spanish lovers; they were gay,\r\ngallant, and joyous in their amours, and captivated by the vivacity of\r\ntheir attacks. They were at first held in light estimation by the grave\r\nand stately Spanish knights until they made themselves to be respected\r\nby their wonderful prowess in the field.\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous of the volunteers, however, who appeared in Cordova\r\non this occasion was an English knight of royal connection. This was the\r\nLord Scales, earl of Rivers, brother to the queen of England, wife of\r\nHenry VII. He had distinguished himself in the preceding year at the\r\nbattle of Bosworth Field, where Henry Tudor, then earl of Richmond,\r\novercame Richard III. That decisive battle having left the country\r\nat peace, the earl of Rivers, having conceived a passion for warlike\r\nscenes, repaired to the Castilian court to keep his arms in exercise in\r\na campaign against the Moors. He brought with him a hundred archers,\r\nall dextrous with the longbow and the cloth-yard arrow; also two hundred\r\nyeomen, armed cap-a-pie, who fought with pike and battle-axe--men robust\r\nof frame and of prodigious strength. The worthy padre Fray Antonio\r\nAgapida describes this stranger knight and his followers with his\r\naccustomed accuracy and minuteness.\r\n\r\n“This cavalier,” he observes, “was from the far island of England, and\r\nbrought with him a train of his vassals, men who had been hardened in\r\ncertain civil wars which raged in their country. They were a comely race\r\nof men, but too fair and fresh for warriors, not having the sunburnt,\r\nwarlike hue of our old Castilian soldiery. They were huge feeders also\r\nand deep carousers, and could not accommodate themselves to the sober\r\ndiet of our troops, but must fain eat and drink after the manner of\r\ntheir own country. They were often noisy and unruly also in their\r\nwassail, and their quarter of the camp was prone to be a scene of loud\r\nrevel and sudden brawl. They were, withal, of great pride, yet it was\r\nnot like our inflammable Spanish pride: they stood not much upon the\r\n“pundonor,” the high punctilio, and rarely drew the stiletto in their\r\ndisputes, but their pride was silent and contumelious. Though from a\r\nremote and somewhat barbarous island, they believed themselves the most\r\nperfect men upon earth, and magnified their chieftain, the Lord Scales,\r\nbeyond the greatest of their grandees. With all this, it must be said of\r\nthem that they were marvellous good men in the field, dextrous archers\r\nand powerful with the battle-axe. In their great pride and self-will\r\nthey always sought to press in the advance and take the post of danger,\r\ntrying to outvie our Spanish chivalry. They did not rush on fiercely\r\nto the fight, nor make a brilliant onset like the Moorish and Spanish\r\ntroops, but they went into the fight deliberately and persisted\r\nobstinately and were slow to find out when they were beaten. Withal,\r\nthey were much esteemed, yet little liked, by our soldiery, who\r\nconsidered them stanch companions in the field, yet coveted but little\r\nfellowship with them in the camp.\r\n\r\n“Their commander, Lord Scales, was an accomplished cavalier, of gracious\r\nand noble presence and fair speech: it was a marvel to see so much\r\ncourtesy in a knight brought up so far from our Castilian court. He was\r\nmuch honored by the king and queen, and found great favor with the fair\r\ndames about the court, who, indeed, are rather prone to be pleased with\r\nforeign cavaliers. He went always in costly state, attended by pages and\r\nesquires, and accompanied by noble young cavaliers of his country, who\r\nhad enrolled themselves under his banner to learn the gentle exercise\r\nof arms. In all pageants and festivals the eyes of the populace were\r\nattracted by the singular bearing and rich array of the English earl\r\nand his train, who prided themselves in always appearing in the garb and\r\nmanner of their country, and were, indeed, something very magnificent,\r\ndelectable, and strange to behold.”\r\n\r\nThe worthy chronicler is no less elaborate in his description of the\r\nmasters of Santiago, Calatrava, and Alcantara and their valiant knights,\r\narmed at all points and decorated with the badges of their orders.\r\nThese, he affirms, were the flower of Christian chivalry: being\r\nconstantly in service, they became more steadfast and accomplished in\r\ndiscipline than the irregular and temporary levies of the feudal nobles.\r\nCalm, solemn, and stately, they sat like towers upon their powerful\r\nchargers. On parades they manifested none of the show and ostentation\r\nof the other troops; neither in battle did they endeavor to signalize\r\nthemselves by any fiery vivacity or desperate and vainglorious exploit:\r\neverything with them was measured and sedate, yet it was observed that\r\nnone were more warlike in their appearance in the camp or more terrible\r\nfor their achievements in the field.\r\n\r\nThe gorgeous magnificence of the Spanish nobles found but little favor\r\nin the eyes of the sovereigns. They saw that it caused a competition in\r\nexpense ruinous to cavaliers of moderate fortune, and they feared that\r\na softness and effeminacy might thus be introduced incompatible with the\r\nstern nature of the war. They signified their disapprobation to several\r\nof the principal noblemen, and recommended a more sober and soldier-like\r\ndisplay while in actual service.\r\n\r\n“These are rare troops for a tourney, my lord,” said Ferdinand to the\r\nduke of Infantado as he beheld his retainers glittering in gold and\r\nembroidery, “but gold, though gorgeous, is soft and yielding: iron is\r\nthe metal for the field.”\r\n\r\n“Sire,” replied the duke, “if my men parade in gold, Your Majesty will\r\nfind they fight with steel.” The king smiled, but shook his head, and\r\nthe duke treasured up his speech in his heart.\r\n\r\nIt remains now to reveal the immediate object of this mighty and\r\nchivalrous preparation, which had, in fact, the gratification of a royal\r\npique at bottom. The severe lesson which Ferdinand had received from the\r\nveteran Ali Atar before the walls of Loxa, though it had been of great\r\nservice in rendering him wary in his attacks upon fortified places, yet\r\nrankled sorely in his mind, and he had ever since held Loxa in peculiar\r\nodium. It was, in truth, one of the most belligerent and troublesome\r\ncities on the borders, incessantly harassing Andalusia by its\r\nincursions. It also intervened between the Christian territories and\r\nAlhama and other important places gained in the kingdom of Granada. For\r\nall these reasons King Ferdinand had determined to make another grand\r\nattempt upon this warrior city, and for this purpose had summoned to the\r\nfield his most powerful chivalry.\r\n\r\nIt was in the month of May that the king sallied from Cordova at the\r\nhead of his army. He had twelve thousand cavalry and forty thousand\r\nfoot-soldiers armed with crossbows, lances, and arquebuses. There\r\nwere six thousand pioneers with hatchets, pickaxes, and crowbars for\r\nlevelling roads. He took with him also a great train of lombards and\r\nother heavy artillery, with a body of Germans skilled in the service of\r\nordnance and the art of battering walls.\r\n\r\nIt was a glorious spectacle (says Fray Antonio Agapida) to behold this\r\npompous pageant issuing forth from Cordova, the pennons and devices of\r\nthe proudest houses of Spain, with those of gallant stranger knights,\r\nfluttering above a sea of crests and plumes--to see it slowly moving,\r\nwith flash of helm and cuirass and buckler, across the ancient bridge\r\nand reflected in the waters of the Guadalquivir, while the neigh of\r\nsteed and blast of trumpet vibrated in the air and resounded to the\r\ndistant mountains. “But, above all,” concludes the good father, with his\r\naccustomed zeal, “it was triumphant to behold the standard of the faith\r\neverywhere displayed, and to reflect that this was no worldly-minded\r\narmy, intent upon some temporal scheme of ambition or revenge, but a\r\nChristian host bound on a crusade to extirpate the vile seed of Mahomet\r\nfrom the land and to extend the pure dominion of the Church.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nHOW FRESH COMMOTIONS BROKE OUT IN GRANADA, AND HOW THE PEOPLE UNDERTOOK\r\nTO ALLAY THEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile perfect unity of object and harmony of operation gave power to\r\nthe Christian arms, the devoted kingdom of Granada continued a prey to\r\ninternal feuds. The transient popularity of El Zagal had declined ever\r\nsince the death of his brother, and the party of Boabdil was daily\r\ngaining strength; the Albaycin and the Alhambra were again arrayed\r\nagainst each other in deadly strife, and the streets of unhappy Granada\r\nwere daily dyed in the blood of her children. In the midst of these\r\ndissensions tidings arrived of the formidable army assembling at\r\nCordova. The rival factions paused in their infatuated brawls, and\r\nwere roused to a temporary sense of the common danger. They forthwith\r\nresorted to their old expedient of new-modelling their government, or\r\nrather of making and unmaking kings. The elevation of El Zagal to the\r\nthrone had not produced the desired effect; what, then, was to be done?\r\nRecall Boabdil el Chico and acknowledge him again as sovereign? While\r\nthey were in a popular tumult of deliberation Hamet Aben Zarrax,\r\nsurnamed El Santo, rose among them. This was the same wild, melancholy\r\nman who had predicted the woes of Granada. He issued from one of the\r\ncaverns of the adjacent height which overhangs the Darro, and has since\r\nbeen called the Holy Mountain. His appearance was more haggard than\r\never, for the unheeded spirit of prophecy seemed to have turned inwardly\r\nand preyed upon his vitals. “Beware, O Moslems,” exclaimed he, “of men\r\nwho are eager to govern, yet are unable to protect. Why slaughter each\r\nother for El Chico or El Zagal? Let your kings renounce their contests,\r\nunite for the salvation of Granada, or let them be deposed.”\r\n\r\nHamet Aben Zarrax had long been revered as a saint--he was now\r\nconsidered an oracle. The old men and the nobles immediately consulted\r\ntogether how the two rival kings might be brought to accord. They had\r\ntried most expedients: it was now determined to divide the kingdom\r\nbetween them, giving Granada, Malaga, Velez Malaga, Almeria, Almunecar,\r\nand their dependencies to El Zagal, and the residue to Boabdil el Chico.\r\nAmong the cities granted to the latter Loxa was particularly specified,\r\nwith a condition that he should immediately take command of it in\r\nperson, for the council thought the favor he enjoyed with the Castilian\r\nmonarchs might avert the threatened attack.\r\n\r\nEl Zagal readily agreed to this arrangement: he had been hastily\r\nelevated to the throne by an ebullition of the people, and might be as\r\nhastily cast down again. It secured him one half of a kingdom to which\r\nhe had no hereditary right, and he trusted to force or fraud to gain the\r\nother half hereafter. The wily old monarch even sent a deputation to his\r\nnephew, making a merit of offering him cheerfully the half which he had\r\nthus been compelled to relinquish, and inviting him to enter into an\r\namicable coalition for the good of the country.\r\n\r\nThe heart of Boabdil shrank from all connection with a man who had\r\nsought his life, and whom he regarded as the murderer of his kindred. He\r\naccepted one half of the kingdom as an offer from the nation, not to be\r\nrejected by a prince who scarcely held possession of the ground he stood\r\non. He asserted, nevertheless, his absolute right to the whole, and only\r\nsubmitted to the partition out of anxiety for the present good of his\r\npeople. He assembled his handful of adherents and prepared to hasten\r\nto Loxa. As he mounted his horse to depart, Hamet Aben Zarrax stood\r\nsuddenly before him. “Be true to thy country and thy faith,” cried he;\r\n“hold no further communication with these Christian dogs. Trust not the\r\nhollow-hearted friendship of the Castilian king; he is mining the\r\nearth beneath thy feet. Choose one of two things: be a sovereign or a\r\nslave--thou canst not be both.”\r\n\r\nBoabdil ruminated on these words; he made many wise resolutions, but\r\nhe was prone always to act from the impulse of the moment, and was\r\nunfortunately given to temporize in his policy. He wrote to Ferdinand,\r\ninforming him that Loxa and certain other cities had returned to their\r\nallegiance, and that he held them as vassal to the Castilian Crown,\r\naccording to their convention. He conjured him, therefore, to refrain\r\nfrom any meditated attack, offering free passage to the Spanish army to\r\nMalaga or any other place under the dominion of his uncle.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Zurita, lib. 20, c. 68.\r\n\r\n\r\nFerdinand turned a deaf ear to the entreaty and to all professions\r\nof friendship and vassalage. Boabdil was nothing to him but as an\r\ninstrument for stirring up the flames of civil war. He now insisted\r\nthat he had entered into a hostile league with his uncle, and had\r\nconsequently forfeited all claims to his indulgence; and he prosecuted\r\nwith the greater earnestness his campaign against the city of Loxa.\r\n\r\n“Thus,” observes the worthy Fray Antonio Agapida, “thus did this most\r\nsagacious sovereign act upon the text in the eleventh chapter of the\r\nevangelist St. Luke, that ‘a kingdom divided against itself cannot\r\nstand.’ He had induced these infidels to waste and destroy themselves\r\nby internal dissensions, and finally cast forth the survivor, while the\r\nMoorish monarchs by their ruinous contests made good the old Castilian\r\nproverb in cases of civil war, ‘El vencido vencido, y el vencidor\r\nperdido’ (the conquered conquered, and the conqueror undone).” *\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Garibay, lib. 40, c. 33.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nHOW KING FERDINAND HELD A COUNCIL OF WAR AT THE ROCK OF THE LOVERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe royal army on its march against Loxa lay encamped one pleasant\r\nevening in May in a meadow on the banks of the river Yeguas, around the\r\nfoot of a lofty cliff called the Rock of the Lovers. The quarters\r\nof each nobleman formed as it were a separate little encampment, his\r\nstately pavilion, surmounted by his fluttering pennon, rising above the\r\nsurrounding tents of his vassals and retainers. A little apart from the\r\nothers, as it were in proud reserve, was the encampment of the English\r\nearl. It was sumptuous in its furniture and complete in all its\r\nmunitions. Archers and soldiers armed with battle-axes kept guard around\r\nit, while above the standard of England rolled out its ample folds and\r\nflapped in the evening breeze.\r\n\r\nThe mingled sounds of various tongues and nations were heard from the\r\nsoldiery as they watered their horses in the stream or busied themselves\r\nround the fires which began to glow here and there in the twilight--the\r\ngay chanson of the Frenchman, singing of his amours on the pleasant\r\nbanks of the Loire or the sunny regions of the Garonne; the broad\r\nguttural tones of the German, chanting some doughty “krieger lied” or\r\nextolling the vintage of the Rhine; the wild romance of the Spaniard,\r\nreciting the achievements of the Cid and many a famous passage of the\r\nMoorish wars; and the long and melancholy ditty of the Englishman,\r\ntreating of some feudal hero or redoubtable outlaw of his distant\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nOn a rising ground, commanding a view of the whole encampment, stood the\r\nample and magnificent pavilion of the king, with the banner of Castile\r\nand Aragon and the holy standard of the cross erected before it. In this\r\ntent there assembled the principal commanders of the army, having been\r\nsummoned by Ferdinand to a council of war on receiving tidings that\r\nBoabdil had thrown himself into Loxa with a considerable reinforcement.\r\nAfter some consultation it was determined to invest Loxa on both sides:\r\none part of the army should seize upon the dangerous but commanding\r\nheight of Santo Albohacen in front of the city, while the remainder,\r\nmaking a circuit, should encamp on the opposite side.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was this resolved upon than the marques of Cadiz stood forth\r\nand claimed the post of danger in behalf of himself and those cavaliers,\r\nhis companions-in-arms, who had been compelled to relinquish it by the\r\ngeneral retreat of the army on the former siege. The enemy had exulted\r\nover them as if driven from it in disgrace. To regain that perilous\r\nheight, to pitch their tents upon it, and to avenge the blood of their\r\nvaliant compeer, the master of Calatrava, who had fallen upon it, was\r\ndue to their fame: the marques demanded, therefore, that they might lead\r\nthe advance and secure that height, engaging to hold the enemy employed\r\nuntil the main army should take its position on the opposite side of the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nKing Ferdinand readily granted his permission, upon which the count\r\nde Cabra entreated to be admitted to a share of the enterprise. He had\r\nalways been accustomed to serve in the advance, and now that Boabdil was\r\nin the field and a king was to be taken, he could not content himself\r\nwith remaining in the rear. Ferdinand yielded his consent, for he was\r\ndisposed to give the good count every opportunity to retrieve his late\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\nThe English earl, when he heard there was an enterprise of danger in\r\nquestion, was hot to be admitted to the party, but the king restrained\r\nhis ardor. “These cavaliers,” said he, “conceive that they have an\r\naccount to settle with their pride; let them have the enterprise to\r\nthemselves, my lord: if you follow these Moorish wars long, you will\r\nfind no lack of perilous service.”\r\n\r\nThe marques of Cadiz and his companions-in-arms struck their tents\r\nbefore daybreak; they were five thousand horse and twelve thousand foot,\r\nand marched rapidly along the defiles of the mountains, the cavaliers\r\nbeing anxious to strike the blow and get possession of the height of\r\nAlbohacen before the king with the main army should arrive to their\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nThe city of Loxa stands on a high hill between two mountains on the\r\nbanks of the Xenil. To attain the height of Albohacen the troops had\r\nto pass over a tract of rugged and broken country and a deep valley\r\nintersected by those canals and watercourses with which the Moors\r\nirrigated their lands: they were extremely embarrassed in this part of\r\ntheir march, and in imminent risk of being cut up in detail before they\r\ncould reach the height.\r\n\r\nThe count de Cabra, with his usual eagerness, endeavored to push across\r\nthis valley in defiance of every obstacle: he, in consequence, soon\r\nbecame entangled with his cavalry among the canals, but his impatience\r\nwould not permit him to retrace his steps and choose a more practicable\r\nbut circuitous route. Others slowly crossed another part of the valley\r\nby the aid of pontoons, while the marques of Cadiz, Don Alonso de\r\nAguilar, and the count de Urena, being more experienced in the ground\r\nfrom their former campaign, made a circuit round the bottom of the\r\nheight, and, winding up it, began to display their squadrons and elevate\r\ntheir banners on the redoubtable post which in their former siege they\r\nhad been compelled so reluctantly to abandon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nHOW THE ROYAL ARMY APPEARED BEFORE THE CITY OF LOXA, AND HOW IT WAS\r\nRECEIVED; AND OF THE DOUGHTY ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE ENGLISH EARL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe advance of the Christian army upon Loxa threw the wavering Boabdil\r\nel Chico into one of his usual dilemmas, and he was greatly perplexed\r\nbetween his oath of allegiance to the Spanish sovereigns and his sense\r\nof duty to his subjects. His doubts were determined by the sight of the\r\nenemy glittering upon the height of Albohacen and by the clamors of the\r\npeople to be led forth to battle. “Allah,” exclaimed he, “thou knowest\r\nmy heart: thou knowest I have been true in my faith to this Christian\r\nmonarch. I have offered to hold Loxa as his vassal, but he has preferred\r\nto approach it as an enemy: on his head be the infraction of our\r\ntreaty!”\r\n\r\nBoabdil was not wanting in courage; he only needed decision. When he had\r\nonce made up his mind he acted vigorously; the misfortune was, he either\r\ndid not make it up at all or he made it up too late. He who decides\r\ntardily generally acts rashly, endeavoring to make up by hurry of action\r\nfor slowness of deliberation. Boabdil hastily buckled on his armor and\r\nsallied forth surrounded by his guards, and at the head of five hundred\r\nhorse and four thousand foot, the flower of his army. Some he detached\r\nto skirmish with the Christians, who were scattered and perplexed in the\r\nvalley, and to prevent their concentrating their forces, while with\r\nhis main body he pressed forward to drive the enemy from the height\r\nof Albohacen before they had time to collect there in any number or to\r\nfortify themselves in that important position.\r\n\r\nThe worthy count de Cabra was yet entangled with his cavalry among the\r\nwater-courses of the valley when he heard the war-cries of the Moors and\r\nsaw their army rushing over the bridge. He recognized Boabdil himself,\r\nby his splendid armor, the magnificent caparison of his steed, and the\r\nbrilliant guard which surrounded him. The royal host swept on toward the\r\nheight of Albohacen: an intervening hill hid it from his sight, but\r\nloud shouts and cries, the din of drums and trumpets, and the reports of\r\narquebuses gave note that the battle had begun.\r\n\r\nHere was a royal prize in the field, and the count de Cabra unable to\r\nget into the action! The good cavalier was in an agony of impatience;\r\nevery attempt to force his way across the valley only plunged him into\r\nnew difficulties. At length, after many eager but ineffectual efforts,\r\nhe was obliged to order his troops to dismount, and slowly and carefully\r\nto lead their horses back along slippery paths and amid plashes of\r\nmire and water where often there was scarce a foothold. The good count\r\ngroaned in spirit and sweat with mere impatience as he went, fearing the\r\nbattle might be fought and the prize won or lost before he could reach\r\nthe field. Having at length toilfully unravelled the mazes of the valley\r\nand arrived at firmer ground, he ordered his troops to mount, and led\r\nthem full gallop to the height. Part of the good count’s wishes were\r\nsatisfied, but the dearest were disappointed: he came in season to\r\npartake of the very hottest of the fight, but the royal prize was no\r\nlonger in the field.\r\n\r\nBoabdil had led on his men with impetuous valor, or rather with hurried\r\nrashness. Heedlessly exposing himself in the front of the battle, he\r\nreceived two wounds in the very first encounter. His guards rallied\r\nround him, defended him with matchless valor, and bore him bleeding out\r\nof the action. The count de Cabra arrived just in time to see the loyal\r\nsquadron crossing the bridge and slowly conveying their disabled monarch\r\ntoward the gate of the city.\r\n\r\nThe departure of Boabdil made no difference in the fury of the battle.\r\nA Moorish warrior, dark and terrible in aspect, mounted on a black\r\ncharger, and followed by a band of savage Gomeres, rushed forward to\r\ntake the lead. It was Hamet el Zegri, the fierce alcayde of Ronda, with\r\nthe remnant of his once-redoubtable garrison. Animated by his example,\r\nthe Moors renewed their assaults upon the height. It was bravely\r\ndefended, on one side by the marques of Cadiz, on another by Don Alonso\r\nde Aguilar, and as fast as the Moors ascended they were driven back and\r\ndashed down the declivities. The count de Urena took his stand upon the\r\nfatal spot where his brother had fallen; his followers entered with\r\nzeal into the feelings of their commander, and heaps of the enemy sunk\r\nbeneath their weapons--sacrifices to the manes of the lamented master of\r\nCalatrava.\r\n\r\nThe battle continued with incredible obstinacy. The Moors knew the\r\nimportance of the height to the safety of the city; the cavaliers felt\r\ntheir honors staked to maintain it. Fresh supplies of troops were poured\r\nout of the city: some battled on the height, while some attacked the\r\nChristians who were still in the valley and among the orchards and\r\ngardens to prevent their uniting their forces. The troops in the valley\r\nwere gradually driven back, and the whole host of the Moors swept around\r\nthe height of Albohacen. The situation of the marques de Cadiz and his\r\ncompanions was perilous in the extreme: they were a mere handful, and,\r\nwhile fighting hand to hand with the Moors who assailed the height, were\r\ngalled from a distance by the crossbows and arquebuses of a host\r\nthat augmented each moment in number. At this critical juncture King\r\nFerdinand emerged from the mountains with the main body of the army, and\r\nadvanced to an eminence commanding a full view of the field of action.\r\nBy his side was the noble English cavalier, the earl of Rivers. This was\r\nthe first time he had witnessed a scene of Moorish warfare. He looked\r\nwith eager interest at the chance-medley fight before him, where there\r\nwas the wild career of cavalry, the irregular and tumultuous rush of\r\ninfantry, and where Christian and Moor were intermingled in deadly\r\nstruggle. The high blood of the English knight mounted at the sight, and\r\nhis soul was stirred within him by the confused war-cries, the clangor\r\nof drums and trumpets, and the reports of arquebuses. Seeing that the\r\nking was sending a reinforcement to the field, he entreated permission\r\nto mingle in the affray and fight according to the fashion of his\r\ncountry. His request being granted, he alighted from his steed: he was\r\nmerely armed “en blanco”--that is to say, with morion, back-piece,\r\nand breast-plate--his sword was girded by his side, and in his hand he\r\nwielded a powerful battle-axe. He was followed by a body of his yeomen\r\narmed in like manner, and by a band of archers with bows made of the\r\ntough English yew tree. The earl turned to his troops and addressed then\r\nbriefly and bluntly, according to the manner of his country. “Remember,\r\nmy merry men all,” said he, “the eyes of strangers are upon you; you are\r\nin a foreign land, fighting for the glory of God and the honor of merry\r\nold England!” A loud shout was the reply. The earl waved his battle-axe\r\nover his head. “St. George for England!” cried he, and to the inspiring\r\nsound of this old English war-cry he and his followers rushed down to\r\nthe battle with manly and courageous hearts.* They soon made their way\r\ninto the midst of the enemy, but when engaged in the hottest of the\r\nfight they made no shouts nor outcries. They pressed steadily forward,\r\ndealing their blows to right and left, hewing down the Moors and cutting\r\ntheir way with their battle-axes like woodmen in a forest; while\r\nthe archers, pressing into the opening they made, plied their bows\r\nvigorously and spread death on every side.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Cura de los Palacios.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Castilian mountaineers beheld the valor of the English\r\nyeomanry, they would not be outdone in hardihood. They could not vie\r\nwith them in weight or bulk, but for vigor and activity they were\r\nsurpassed by none. They kept pace with them, therefore, with equal heart\r\nand rival prowess, and gave a brave support to the stout Englishmen.\r\n\r\nThe Moors were confounded by the fury of these assaults and disheartened\r\nby the loss of Hamet el Zegri, who was carried wounded from the field.\r\nThey gradually fell back upon the bridge; the Christians followed\r\nup their advantage, and drove them over it tumultuously. The Moors\r\nretreated into the suburb, and Lord Rivers and his troops entered\r\nwith them pell-mell, fighting in the streets and in the houses. King\r\nFerdinand came up to the scene of action with his royal guard, and the\r\ninfidels were driven within the city walls. Thus were the suburbs gained\r\nby the hardihood of the English lord, without such an event having been\r\npremeditated.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Cura de los Palacios, MS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earl of Rivers, notwithstanding he had received a wound, still\r\nurged forward in the attack. He penetrated almost to the city gate,\r\nin defiance of a shower of missiles that slew many of his followers.\r\nA stone hurled from the battlements checked his impetuous career: it\r\nstruck him in the face, dashed out two of his front teeth, and laid him\r\nsenseless on the earth. He was removed to a short distance by his men,\r\nbut, recovering his senses, refused to permit himself to be taken from\r\nthe suburb.\r\n\r\nWhen the contest was over the streets presented a piteous spectacle, so\r\nmany of their inhabitants had died in the defence of their thresholds or\r\nbeen slaughtered without resistance. Among the victims was a poor weaver\r\nwho had been at work in his dwelling at this turbulent moment. His wife\r\nurged him to fly into the city. “Why should I fly?” said the Moor--“to\r\nbe reserved for hunger and slavery? I tell you, wife, I will await the\r\nfoe here, for better is it to die quickly by the steel than to perish\r\npiecemeal in chains and dungeons.” He said no more, but resumed his\r\noccupation of weaving, and in the indiscriminate fury of the assault was\r\nslaughtered at his loom.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Pulgar, part 3, c. 58.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Christians remained masters of the field, and proceeded to pitch\r\nthree encampments for the prosecution of the siege. The king, with the\r\ngreat body of the army, took a position on the side of the city next to\r\nGranada; the marques of Cadiz and his brave companions once more pitched\r\ntheir tents upon the height of Santo Albohacen; but the English earl\r\nplanted his standard sturdily within the suburb he had taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF THE SIEGE OF LOXA.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving possession of the heights of Albohacen and the suburb of\r\nthe city, the Christians were enabled to choose the most favorable\r\nsituations for their batteries. They immediately destroyed the stone\r\nbridge by which the garrison had made its sallies, and they threw two\r\nwooden bridges across the river and others over the canals and streams,\r\nso as to establish an easy communication between the different camps.\r\n\r\nWhen all was arranged a heavy fire was opened upon the city from various\r\npoints. They threw not only balls of stone and iron, but great carcasses\r\nof fire, which burst like meteors on the houses, wrapping them instantly\r\nin a blaze. The walls were shattered and the towers toppled down by\r\ntremendous discharges from the lombards. Through the openings thus\r\nmade they could behold the interior of the city--houses tumbling or in\r\nflames, men, women, and children flying in terror through the streets,\r\nand slaughtered by the shower of missiles sent through the openings from\r\nsmaller artillery and from crossbows and arquebuses.\r\n\r\nThe Moors attempted to repair the breaches, but fresh discharges from\r\nthe lombards buried them beneath the ruins of the walls they were\r\nmending. In their despair many of the inhabitants rushed forth into the\r\nnarrow streets of the suburbs and assailed the Christians with darts,\r\nscimetars, and poniards, seeking to destroy rather than defend, and\r\nheedless of death in the confidence that to die fighting with an\r\nunbeliever was to be translated at once to Paradise.\r\n\r\nFor two nights and a day this awful scene continued, when certain of\r\nthe principal inhabitants began to reflect upon the hopelessness of the\r\nconflict: their king was disabled, their principal captains were either\r\nkilled or wounded, their fortifications little better than heaps of\r\nruins. They had urged the unfortunate Boabdil to the conflict; they now\r\nclamored for a capitulation. A parley was procured from the Christian\r\nmonarch, and the terms of surrender were soon adjusted. They were to\r\nyield up the city immediately, with all their Christian captives, and to\r\nsally forth with as much of their property as they could take with\r\nthem. The marques of Cadiz, on whose honor and humanity they had great\r\nreliance, was to escort them to Granada to protect them from assault or\r\nrobbery: such as chose to remain in Spain were to be permitted to reside\r\nin Castile, Aragon, or Valencia. As to Boabdil el Chico, he was to\r\ndo homage as vassal to King Ferdinand, but no charge was to be urged\r\nagainst him of having violated his former pledge. If he should yield\r\nup all pretensions to Granada, the title of duke of Guadix was to be\r\nassigned to him and the territory thereto annexed, provided it should be\r\nrecovered from El Zagal within six months.\r\n\r\nThe capitulation being arranged, they gave as hostages the alcayde\r\nof the city and the principal officers, together with the sons of their\r\nlate chieftain, the veteran Ali Atar. The warriors of Loxa then issued\r\nforth, humbled and dejected at having to surrender those walls which\r\nthey had so long maintained with valor and renown, and the women and\r\nchildren filled the air with lamentations at being exiled from their\r\nnative homes.\r\n\r\nLast came forth Boabdil, most truly called El Zogoybi, the Unlucky.\r\nAccustomed, as he was, to be crowned and uncrowned, to be ransomed\r\nand treated as a matter of bargain, he had acceded of course to\r\nthe capitulation. He was enfeebled by his wounds and had an air of\r\ndejection, yet, it is said, his conscience acquitted him of a breach\r\nof faith toward the Castilian sovereigns, and the personal valor he\r\nhad displayed had caused a sympathy for him among many of the Christian\r\ncavaliers. He knelt to Ferdinand according to the forms of vassalage,\r\nand then departed in melancholy mood for Priego, a town about three\r\nleagues distant.\r\n\r\nFerdinand immediately ordered Loxa to be repaired and strongly\r\ngarrisoned. He was greatly elated at the capture of this place, in\r\nconsequence of his former defeat before its walls. He passed great\r\nencomiums upon the commanders who had distinguished themselves, and\r\nhistorians dwelt particularly upon his visit to the tent of the\r\nEnglish earl. His Majesty consoled him for the loss of his teeth by the\r\nconsideration that he might otherwise have lost them by natural decay,\r\nwhereas the lack of them would now be esteemed a beauty rather than a\r\ndefect, serving as a trophy of the glorious cause in which he had been\r\nengaged.\r\n\r\nThe earl replied that he gave thanks to God and to the Holy Virgin for\r\nbeing thus honored by a visit from the most potent king in Christendom;\r\nthat he accepted with all gratitude his gracious consolation for the\r\nloss of his teeth, though he held it little to lose two teeth in the\r\nservice of God, who had given him all--“A speech,” says Fray Antonio\r\nAgapida, “full of most courtly wit and Christian piety; and one only\r\nmarvels that it should have been made by a native of an island so far\r\ndistant from Castile.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nCAPTURE OF ILLORA.\r\n\r\n\r\nKing Ferdinand followed up his victory at Loxa by laying siege to the\r\nstrong town of Illora. This redoubtable fortress was perched upon a high\r\nrock in the midst of a spacious valley. It was within four leagues of\r\nthe Moorish capital, and its lofty castle, keeping vigilant watch over a\r\nwide circuit of country, was termed the right eye of Granada.\r\n\r\nThe alcayde of Illora was one of the bravest of the Moorish commanders,\r\nand made every preparation to defend his fortress to the last extremity.\r\nHe sent the women and children, the aged and infirm, to the metropolis.\r\nHe placed barricades in the suburbs, opened doors of communication from\r\nhouse to house, and pierced their walls with loopholes for the discharge\r\nof crossbows, arquebuses, and other missiles.\r\n\r\nKing Ferdinand arrived before the place with all his forces; he\r\nstationed himself upon the hill of Encinilla, and distributed the other\r\nencampments in various situations so as to invest the fortress. Knowing\r\nthe valiant character of the alcayde and the desperate courage of the\r\nMoors, he ordered the encampments to be fortified with trenches and\r\npalisadoes, the guards to be doubled, and sentinels to be placed in all\r\nthe watch-towers of the adjacent heights.\r\n\r\nWhen all was ready the duke del Infantado demanded the attack: it was\r\nhis first campaign, and he was anxious to disprove the royal insinuation\r\nmade against the hardihood of his embroidered chivalry. King Ferdinand\r\ngranted his demand, with a becoming compliment to his spirit; he ordered\r\nthe count de Cabra to make a simultaneous attack upon a different\r\nquarter. Both chiefs led forth their troops--those of the duke in fresh\r\nand brilliant armor, richly ornamented, and as yet uninjured by the\r\nservice of the field; those of the count were weatherbeaten veterans,\r\nwhose armor was dented and hacked in many a hard-fought battle. The\r\nyouthful duke blushed at the contrast. “Cavaliers,” cried he, “we\r\nhave been reproached with the finery of our array: let us prove that a\r\ntrenchant blade may rest in a gilded sheath. Forward! to the foe! and I\r\ntrust in God that as we enter this affray knights well accoutred, so\r\nwe shall leave it cavaliers well proved.” His men responded by eager\r\nacclamations, and the duke led them forward to the assault. He advanced\r\nunder a tremendous shower of stones, darts, balls, and arrows, but\r\nnothing could check his career; he entered the suburb sword in hand;\r\nhis men fought furiously, though with great loss, for every dwelling had\r\nbeen turned into a fortress. After a severe conflict they succeeded\r\nin driving the Moors into the town about the same time that the other\r\nsuburb was carried by the count de Cabra and his veterans. The troops\r\nof the duke del Infantado came out of the contest thinned in number\r\nand covered with blood and dust and wounds; they received the highest\r\nencomiums of the king, and there was never afterward any sneer at their\r\nembroidery.\r\n\r\nThe suburbs being taken, three batteries, each furnished with eight\r\nhuge lombards, were opened upon the fortress. The damage and havoc were\r\ntremendous, for the fortifications had not been constructed to withstand\r\nsuch engines. The towers were overthrown, the walls battered to pieces;\r\nthe interior of the place was all exposed, houses were demolished, and\r\nmany people slain. The Moors were terrified by the tumbling ruins and\r\nthe tremendous din. The alcayde had resolved to defend the place\r\nuntil the last extremity: he beheld it a heap of rubbish; there was no\r\nprospect of aid from Granada; his people had lost all spirit to\r\nfight and were vociferous for a surrender; with a reluctant heart he\r\ncapitulated. The inhabitants were permitted to depart with all their\r\neffects, excepting their arms, and were escorted in safety by the duke\r\ndel Infantado and the count de Cabra to the bridge of Pinos, within two\r\nleagues of Granada.\r\n\r\nKing Ferdinand gave directions to repair the fortifications of Illora\r\nand to place it in a strong state of defence. He left as alcayde of the\r\ntown and fortress Gonsalvo de Cordova, younger brother of Don Alonso\r\nde Aguilar. This gallant cavalier was captain of the royal guards of\r\nFerdinand and Isabella, and gave already proofs of that prowess which\r\nafterward rendered him so renowned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nOF THE ARRIVAL OF QUEEN ISABELLA AT THE CAMP BEFORE MOCLIN, AND OF THE\r\nPLEASANT SAYINGS OF THE ENGLISH EARL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe war of Granada, however poets may embroider it with the flowers of\r\ntheir fancy, was certainly one of the sternest of those iron conflicts\r\nwhich have been celebrated under the name of “holy wars.” The worthy\r\nFray Antonio Agapida dwells with unsated delight upon the succession of\r\nrugged mountain-enterprises, bloody battles, and merciless sackings and\r\nravages which characterized it; yet we find him on one occasion pausing\r\nin the full career of victory over the infidels to detail a stately\r\npageant of the Catholic sovereigns.\r\n\r\nImmediately on the capture of Loxa, Ferdinand had written to Isabella,\r\nsoliciting her presence at the camp that he might consult with her as to\r\nthe disposition of their newly-acquired territories.\r\n\r\nIt was in the early part of June that the queen departed from Codova\r\nwith the princess Isabella and numerous ladies of her court. She had\r\na glorious attendance of cavaliers and pages, with many guards and\r\ndomestics. There were forty mules for the use of the queen, the\r\nprincess, and their train.\r\n\r\nAs this courtly cavalcade approached the Rock of the Lovers on the banks\r\nof the river Yeguas, they beheld a splendid train of knights advancing\r\nto meet them. It was headed by that accomplished cavalier the\r\nmarques-duke de Cadiz, accompanied by the adelantado of Andalusia. He\r\nhad left the camp the day after the capture of Illora, and advanced\r\nthus far to receive the queen and escort her over the borders. The queen\r\nreceived the marques with distinguished honor, for he was esteemed the\r\nmirror of chivalry. His actions in this war had become the theme of\r\nevery tongue, and many hesitated not to compare him in prowess with the\r\nimmortal Cid.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Cura de los Palacios.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus gallantly attended, the queen entered the vanquished frontier of\r\nGranada, journeying securely along the pleasant banks of the Xenil, so\r\nlately subject to the scourings of the Moors. She stopped at Loxa, where\r\nshe administered aid and consolation to the wounded, distributing money\r\namong them for their support according to their rank.\r\n\r\nThe king after the capture of Illora had removed his camp before the\r\nfortress of Moclin, with an intention of besieging it. Thither the queen\r\nproceeded, still escorted through the mountain-roads by the marques of\r\nCadiz. As Isabella drew near to the camp the duke del Infantado issued\r\nforth a league and a half to receive her, magnificently arrayed and\r\nfollowed by all his chivalry in glorious attire. With him came the\r\nstandard of Seville, borne by the men-at-arms of that renowned city,\r\nand the prior of St. Juan with his followers. They ranged themselves in\r\norder of battle on the left of the road by which the queen was to pass.\r\n\r\nThe worthy Agapida is loyally minute in his description of the state\r\nand grandeur of the Catholic sovereigns. The queen rode a chestnut mule,\r\nseated in a magnificent saddle-chair decorated with silver gilt. The\r\nhousings of the mule were of fine crimson cloth, the borders embroidered\r\nwith gold, the reins and head-piece were of satin, curiously embossed\r\nwith needlework of silk and wrought with golden letters. The queen wore\r\na brial or regal skirt of velvet, under which were others of brocade;\r\na scarlet mantle, ornamented in the Moresco fashion; and a black hat,\r\nembroidered round the crown and brim. The infanta was likewise mounted\r\non a chestnut mule richly caparisoned: she wore a brial or skirt of\r\nblack brocade and a black mantle ornamented like that of the queen.\r\n\r\nWhen the royal cavalcade passed by the chivalry of the duke del\r\nInfantado, which was drawn out in battle array, the queen made a\r\nreverence to the standard of Seville and ordered it to pass to the right\r\nhand. When she approached the camp the multitude ran forth to meet her\r\nwith great demonstrations of joy, for she was universally beloved by her\r\nsubjects. All the battalions sallied forth in military array, bearing\r\nthe various standards and banners of the camp, which were lowered in\r\nsalutation as she passed.\r\n\r\nThe king now came forth in royal state, mounted on a superb chestnut\r\nhorse and attended by many grandees of Castile. He wore a jubon or close\r\nvest of crimson cloth, with cuisses or short skirts of yellow satin,\r\na loose cassock of brocade, a rich Moorish scimetar, and a hat with\r\nplumes. The grandees who attended him were arrayed with wonderful\r\nmagnificence, each according to his taste and invention.\r\n\r\nThese high and mighty princes (says Antonio Agapida) regarded each other\r\nwith great deference as allied sovereigns, rather than with connubial\r\nfamiliarity as mere husband and wife. When they approached each other,\r\ntherefore, before embracing, they made three profound reverences, the\r\nqueen taking off her hat and remaining in a silk net or caul, with her\r\nface uncovered. The king then approached and embraced her, and kissed\r\nher respectfully on the cheek. He also embraced his daughter the\r\nprincess, and, making the sign of the cross, he blessed her and kissed\r\nher on the lips.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Cura de los Palacios.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe good Agapida seems scarcely to have been more struck with the\r\nappearance of the sovereigns than with that of the English earl. He\r\nfollowed (says he) immediately after the king, with great pomp and,\r\nin an extraordinary manner, taking precedence of all the rest. He was\r\nmounted “a la guisa,” or with long stirrups, on a superb chestnut horse,\r\nwith trappings of azure silk which reached to the ground. The housings\r\nwere of mulberry powdered with stars of gold. He was armed in proof,\r\nand wore over his armor a short French mantle of black brocade; he had a\r\nwhite French hat with plumes, and carried on his left arm a small round\r\nbuckler banded with gold. Five pages attended him, apparelled in silk\r\nand brocade and mounted on horses sumptuously caparisoned; he had also a\r\ntrain of followers bravely attired after the fashion of his country.\r\n\r\nHe advanced in a chivalrous and courteous manner, making his reverences\r\nfirst to the queen and infanta, and afterward to the king. Queen\r\nIsabella received him graciously, complimenting him on his courageous\r\nconduct at Loxa, and condoling with him on the loss of his teeth. The\r\nearl, however, made light of his disfiguring wound, saying that “our\r\nBlessed Lord, who had built all that house, had opened a window there,\r\nthat he might see more readily what passed within;” * whereupon the\r\nworthy Fray Antonio Agapida is more than ever astonished at the pregnant\r\nwit of this island cavalier. The earl continued some little distance\r\nby the side of the royal family, complimenting them all with courteous\r\nspeeches, his horse curveting and caracoling, but being managed with\r\ngreat grace and dexterity, leaving the grandees and the people at large\r\nnot more filled with admiration at the strangeness and magnificence of\r\nhis state than at the excellence of his horsemanship.**\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Pietro Martyr, Epist. 61.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * *Cura de los Palacios.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo testify her sense of the gallantry and services of this noble English\r\nknight, who had come from so far to assist in their wars, the queen sent\r\nhim the next day presents of twelve horses, with stately tents, fine\r\nlinen, two beds with coverings of gold brocade, and many other articles\r\nof great value.\r\n\r\nHaving refreshed himself, as it were, with the description of this\r\nprogress of Queen Isabella to the camp and the glorious pomp of the\r\nCatholic sovereigns, the worthy Antonio Agapida returns with renewed\r\nrelish to his pious work of discomfiting the Moors.\r\n\r\nThe description of this royal pageant and the particulars concerning the\r\nEnglish earl, thus given from the manuscript of Fray Antonio Agapida,\r\nagree precisely with the chronicle of Andres Bernaldez, the curate of\r\nLos Palacios. The English earl makes no further figure in this war. It\r\nappears from various histories that he returned in the course of the\r\nyear to England. In the following year his passion for fighting took\r\nhim to the Continent, at the head of four hundred adventurers, in aid of\r\nFrancis, duke of Brittany, against Louis XI. of France. He was killed\r\nin the same year (1488) in the battle of St. Alban’s between the Bretons\r\nand the French.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\nHOW KING FERDINAND ATTACKED MOCLIN, AND OF THE STRANGE EVENTS THAT\r\nATTENDED ITS CAPTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n“The Catholic sovereigns,” says Fray Antonio Agapida, “had by this time\r\nclosely clipped the right wing of the Moorish vulture.” In other words,\r\nmost of the strong fortresses along the western frontier of Granada had\r\nfallen beneath the Christian artillery. The army now lay encamped before\r\nthe town of Moclin, on the frontier of Jaen, one of the most stubborn\r\nfortresses of the border. It stood on a high rocky hill, the base of\r\nwhich was nearly girdled by a river: a thick forest protected the\r\nback part of the town toward the mountain. Thus strongly situated, it\r\ndomineered, with its frowning battlements and massive towers, all the\r\nmountain-passes into that part of the country, and was called “the\r\nshield of Granada.” It had a double arrear of blood to settle with the\r\nChristians: two hundred years before, a master of Santiago and all his\r\ncavaliers had been lanced by the Moors before its gates. It had recently\r\nmade terrible slaughter among the troops of the good count de Cabra in\r\nhis precipitate attempt to entrap the old Moorish monarch. The pride of\r\nFerdinand had been piqued by being obliged on that occasion to recede\r\nfrom his plan and abandon his concerted attack on the place; he was now\r\nprepared to take a full revenge.\r\n\r\nEl Zagal, the old warrior-king of Granada, anticipating a second\r\nattempt, had provided the place with ample ammunitions and provisions,\r\nhad ordered trenches to be digged and additional bulwarks thrown up, and\r\ncaused all the old men, the women, and the children to be removed to the\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nSuch was the strength of the fortress and the difficulties of its\r\nposition that Ferdinand anticipated much trouble in reducing it, and\r\nmade every preparation for a regular siege. In the centre of his camp\r\nwere two great mounds, one of sacks of flour, the other of grain, which\r\nwere called the royal granary. Three batteries of heavy ordnance\r\nwere opened against the citadel and principal towers, while smaller\r\nartillery, engines for the discharge of missiles, arquebuses, and\r\ncrossbows, were distributed in various places to keep up a fire into any\r\nbreaches that might be made, and upon those of the garrison who should\r\nappear on the battlements.\r\n\r\nThe lombards soon made an impression on the works, demolishing a part of\r\nthe wall and tumbling down several of those haughty towers which, from\r\ntheir height, had been impregnable before the invention of gunpowder.\r\nThe Moors repaired their walls as well as they were able, and, still\r\nconfiding in the strength of their situation, kept up a resolute\r\ndefence, firing down from their lofty battlements and towers upon the\r\nChristian camp. For two nights and a day an incessant fire was kept up,\r\nso that there was not a moment in which the roaring of ordnance was not\r\nheard or some damage sustained by the Christians or the Moors. It was\r\na conflict, however, more of engineers and artillerists than of gallant\r\ncavaliers; there was no sally of troops nor shock of armed men nor rush\r\nand charge of cavalry. The knights stood looking on with idle weapons,\r\nwaiting until they should have an opportunity of signalizing their\r\nprowess by scaling the walls or storming the breaches. As the place,\r\nhowever, was assailable only in one part, there was every prospect of a\r\nlong and obstinate resistance.\r\n\r\nThe engineers, as usual, discharged not merely balls of stone and\r\niron to demolish the walls, but flaming balls of inextinguishable\r\ncombustibles designed to set fire to the houses. One of these, which\r\npassed high through the air like a meteor, sending out sparks and\r\ncrackling as it went, entered the window of a tower which was used as\r\na magazine of gunpowder. The tower blew up with a tremendous explosion;\r\nthe Moors who were upon its battlements were hurled into the air,\r\nand fell mangled in various parts of the town, and the houses in its\r\nvicinity were rent and overthrown as with an earthquake.\r\n\r\nThe Moors, who had never witnessed an explosion of the kind, ascribed\r\nthe destruction of the tower to a miracle. Some who had seen the descent\r\nof the flaming ball imagined that fire had fallen from heaven to punish\r\nthem for their pertinacity. The pious Agapida himself believes that\r\nthis fiery missive was conducted by divine agency to confound the\r\ninfidels--an opinion in which he is supported by other Catholic\r\nhistorians.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Pulgar, Garibay; Lucio Marino Siculo, Cosas Memoral. de Hispan.,\r\nlib.20.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeeing heaven and earth, as it were, combined against them, the Moors\r\nlost all heart: they capitulated, and were permitted to depart with\r\ntheir effects, leaving behind all arms and munitions of war.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic army (says Antonio Agapida) entered Moclin in solemn state,\r\nnot as a licentious host intent upon plunder and desolation, but as a\r\nband of Christian warriors coming to purify and regenerate the land. The\r\nstandard of the cross, that ensign of this holy crusade, was borne in\r\nthe advance, followed by the other banners of the army. Then came the\r\nking and queen at the head of a vast number of armed cavaliers. They\r\nwere accompanied by a band of priests and friars, with the choir of\r\nthe royal chapel chanting the canticle “Te Deum laudamus.” As they were\r\nmoving through the streets in this solemn manner, every sound hushed\r\nexcepting the anthem of the choir, they suddenly heard, issuing as it\r\nwere from under ground, a chorus of voices chanting in solemn response\r\n“Benedictum qui venit in nomine Domini.” * The procession paused in\r\nwonder. The sounds rose from Christian captives, and among them several\r\npriests, who were confined in subterraneous dungeons.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Marino Siculo.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe heart of Isabella was greatly touched. She ordered the captives to\r\nbe drawn forth from their cells, and was still more moved at beholding,\r\nby their wan, discolored, and emaciated appearance, how much they had\r\nsuffered. Their hair and beards were overgrown and shagged; they were\r\nwasted by hunger, half naked, and in chains. She ordered that they\r\nshould be clothed and cherished, and money furnished them to bear them\r\nto their homes.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Illescas, Hist. Pontif., lib. 6, c. 20, \\0xA4 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral of the captives were brave cavaliers who had been wounded and\r\nmade prisoners in the defeat of the count de Cabra by El Zagal in the\r\npreceding year. There were also found other melancholy traces of that\r\ndisastrous affair. On visiting the narrow pass where the defeat had\r\ntaken place, the remains of several Christian warriors were found in\r\nthickets or hidden behind rocks or in the clefts of the mountains. These\r\nwere some who had been struck from their horses and wounded too severely\r\nto fly. They had crawled away from the scene of action, and concealed\r\nthemselves to avoid falling into the hands of the enemy, and had thus\r\nperished miserably and alone. The remains of those of note were known by\r\ntheir armor and devices, and were mourned over by their companions who\r\nhad shared the disaster of that day.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Pulgar, part 3, cap. 61.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe queen had these remains piously collected as the relics of so many\r\nmartyrs who had fallen in the cause of the faith. They were interred\r\nwith great solemnity in the mosques of Moclin, which had been purified\r\nand consecrated to Christian worship. “There,” says Antonio Agapida,\r\n“rest the bones of those truly Catholic knights, in the holy ground\r\nwhich in a manner had been sanctified by their blood; and all pilgrims\r\npassing through those mountains offer up prayers and masses for the\r\nrepose of their souls.”\r\n\r\nThe queen remained for some time at Moclin, administering comfort to the\r\nwounded and the prisoners, bringing the newly-acquired territory\r\ninto order, and founding churches and monasteries and other pious\r\ninstitutions. “While the king marched in front, laying waste the land of\r\nthe Philistines,” says the figurative Antonio Agapida, “Queen Isabella\r\nfollowed his traces as the binder follows the reaper, gathering and\r\ngarnering the rich harvest that has fallen beneath his sickle. In this\r\nshe was greatly assisted by the counsels of that cloud of bishops,\r\nfriars, and other saintly men which continually surrounded her,\r\ngarnering the first fruits of this infidel land into the granaries of\r\nthe Church.” Leaving her thus piously employed, the king pursued his\r\ncareer of conquest, determined to lay waste the Vega and carry fire and\r\nsword to the very gates of Granada.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nHOW KING FERDINAND FORAGED THE VEGA; AND OF THE BATTLE OF THE BRIDGE OF\r\nPINOS, AND THE FATE OF THE TWO MOORISH BROTHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuley Abdallah el Zagal had been under a spell of ill-fortune ever since\r\nthe suspicious death of the old king his brother. Success had deserted\r\nhis standard, and with his fickle subjects want of success was one of\r\nthe greatest crimes in a sovereign. He found his popularity declining,\r\nand he lost all confidence in his people. The Christian army marched in\r\nopen defiance through his territories, and sat down deliberately before\r\nhis fortresses; yet he dared not lead forth his legions to oppose them,\r\nlest the inhabitants of the Albaycin, ever ripe for a revolt, should\r\nrise and shut the gates of Granada against his return.\r\n\r\nEvery few days some melancholy train entered the metropolis, the\r\ninhabitants of some captured town bearing the few effects spared them,\r\nand weeping and bewailing the desolation of their homes. When the\r\ntidings arrived that Illora and Moclin had fallen, the people were\r\nseized with consternation. “The right eye of Granada is extinguished,”\r\n exclaimed they; “the shield of Granada is broken: what shall protect\r\nus from the inroad of the foe?” When the survivors of the garrisons of\r\nthose towns arrived, with downcast looks, bearing the marks of battle\r\nand destitute of arms and standards, the populace reviled them in their\r\nwrath, but they answered, “We fought as long as we had force to fight or\r\nwalls to shelter us; but the Christians laid our town and battlements in\r\nruins, and we looked in vain for aid from Granada.”\r\n\r\nThe alcaydes of Illora and Moclin were brothers; they were alike in\r\nprowess and the bravest among the Moorish cavaliers. They had been the\r\nmost distinguished in those tilts and tourneys which graced the happier\r\ndays of Granada, and had distinguished themselves in the sterner\r\nconflicts of the field. Acclamation had always followed their banners,\r\nand they had long been the delight of the people. Yet now, when they\r\nreturned after the capture of their fortresses, they were followed\r\nby the unsteady populace with execrations. The hearts of the alcaydes\r\nswelled with indignation; they found the ingratitude of their countrymen\r\nstill more intolerable than the hostility of the Christians.\r\n\r\nTidings came that the enemy was advancing with his triumphant legions to\r\nlay waste the country about Granada. Still El Zagal did not dare to take\r\nthe field. The two alcaydes of Illora and Moclin stood before him. “We\r\nhave defended your fortresses,” said they, “until we were almost\r\nburied under their ruins, and for our reward we receive scoffings and\r\nrevilings: give us, O king, an opportunity where knightly valor may\r\nsignalize itself--not shut up behind stone walls, but in the open\r\nconflict of the field. The enemy approaches to lay our country desolate:\r\ngive us men to meet him in the advance, and let shame light upon our\r\nheads if we be found wanting in the battle!”\r\n\r\nThe two brothers were sent forth with a large force of horse and foot;\r\nEl Zagal intended, should they be successful, to issue forth with\r\nhis whole force, and by a decisive victory repair the losses he had\r\nsuffered. When the people saw the well-known standards of the brothers\r\ngoing forth to battle, there was a feeble shout, but the alcaydes passed\r\non with stern countenances, for they knew the same voices would curse\r\nthem were they to return unfortunate. They cast a farewell look upon\r\nfair Granada and upon the beautiful fields of their infancy, as if\r\nfor these they were willing to lay down their lives, but not for an\r\nungrateful people.\r\n\r\nThe army of Ferdinand had arrived within two leagues of Granada, at the\r\nbridge of Pinos, a pass famous in the wars of the Moors and Christians\r\nfor many a bloody conflict. It was the pass by which the Castilian\r\nmonarchs generally made their inroads, and was capable of great defence\r\nfrom the ruggedness of the country and the difficulty of the bridge. The\r\nking, with the main body of the army, had attained the brow of a hill,\r\nwhen they beheld the advance guard, under the marques of Cadiz and the\r\nmaster of Santiago, furiously attacked by the enemy in the vicinity of\r\nthe bridge. The Moors rushed to the assault with their usual shouts, but\r\nwith more than usual ferocity. There was a hard struggle at the bridge;\r\nboth parties knew the importance of that pass.\r\n\r\nThe king particularly noted the prowess of two Moorish cavaliers,\r\nalike in arms and devices, and whom by their bearing and attendance he\r\nperceived to be commanders of the enemy. They were the two brothers,\r\nthe alcaydes of Illora and Moclin. Wherever they turned they carried\r\nconfusion and death into the ranks of the Christians, but they fought\r\nwith desperation rather than valor. The count de Cabra and his brother\r\nDon Martin de Cordova pressed forward with eagerness against them, but,\r\nhaving advanced too precipitately, were surrounded by the foe and in\r\nimminent danger. A young Christian knight, seeing their peril, hastened\r\nwith his followers to their relief. The king recognized him for Don Juan\r\nde Aragon, count of Ribargoza, his own nephew, for he was illegitimate\r\nson of the duke of Villahermosa, illegitimate brother of King Ferdinand.\r\nThe splendid armor of Don Juan and the sumptuous caparison of his steed\r\nrendered him a brilliant object of attack. He was assailed on all sides\r\nand his superb steed slain under him, yet still he fought valiantly,\r\nbearing for a time the brunt of the fight and giving the exhausted\r\nforces of the count de Cabra time to recover breath.\r\n\r\nSeeing the peril of these troops and the general obstinacy of the fight,\r\nthe king ordered the royal standard to be advanced, and hastened with\r\nall his forces to the relief of the count de Cabra. At his approach\r\nthe enemy gave way and retreated toward the bridge. The two Moorish\r\ncommanders endeavored to rally their troops and animate them to defend\r\nthis pass to the utmost: they used prayers, remonstrances, menaces, but\r\nalmost in vain. They could only collect a scanty handful of cavaliers;\r\nwith these they planted themselves at the head of the bridge and\r\ndisputed it inch by inch. The fight was hot and obstinate, for but few\r\ncould contend hand to hand, yet many discharged crossbows and arquebuses\r\nfrom the banks. The river was covered with the floating bodies of the\r\nslain. The Moorish band of cavaliers was almost entirely cut to pieces;\r\nthe two brothers fell, covered with wounds, upon the bridge they had\r\nso resolutely defended. They had given up the battle for lost, but had\r\ndetermined not to return alive to ungrateful Granada.\r\n\r\nWhen the people of the capital heard how devotedly they had fallen, they\r\nlamented greatly their deaths and extolled their memory: a column was\r\nerected to their honor in the vicinity of the bridge, which long went by\r\nthe name of “the Tomb of the Brothers.”\r\n\r\nThe army of Ferdinand now marched on and established its camp in the\r\nvicinity of Granada. The worthy Agapida gives many triumphant details\r\nof the ravages committed in the Vega, which was again laid waste, the\r\ngrain, fruits, and other productions of the earth destroyed, and that\r\nearthly paradise rendered a dreary desert. He narrates several fierce\r\nbut ineffectual sallies and skirmishes of the Moors in defence of their\r\nfavorite plain; among which one deserves to be mentioned, as it records\r\nthe achievements of one of the saintly heroes of this war.\r\n\r\nDuring one of the movements of the Christian army near the walls of\r\nGranada a battalion of fifteen hundred cavalry and a large force of\r\nfoot had sallied from the city, and posted themselves near some gardens,\r\nwhich were surrounded by a canal and traversed by ditches for the\r\npurpose of irrigation.\r\n\r\nThe Moors beheld the duke del Infantado pass by with his two splendid\r\nbattalions--one of men-at-arms, the other of light cavalry armed “a la\r\ngineta.” In company with him, but following as a rear-guard, was Don\r\nGarcia Osorio, the belligerent bishop of Jaen, attended by Francisco\r\nBovadillo, the corregidor of his city, and followed by two squadrons of\r\nmen-at-arms from Jaen, Anduxar, Ubeda, and Baeza.* The success of last\r\nyear’s campaign had given the good bishop an inclination for warlike\r\naffairs, and he had once more buckled on his cuirass.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Pulgar, part 3, cap. 62.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Moors were much given to stratagem in warfare. They looked wistfully\r\nat the magnificent squadrons of the duke del Infantado, but their\r\nmartial discipline precluded all attack: the good bishop promised to be\r\na more easy prey. Suffering the duke and his troops to pass unmolested,\r\nthey approached the squadrons of the bishop, and making a pretended\r\nattack, skirmished slightly and fled in apparent confusion. The bishop\r\nconsidered the day his own, and, seconded by his corregidor Bovadillo,\r\nfollowed with valorous precipitation. The Moors fled into the “Huerta\r\ndel Rey,” or Orchard of the King; the troops of the bishop followed\r\nhotly after them.\r\n\r\nWhen the Moors perceived their pursuers fairly embarrassed among the\r\nintricacies of the garden, they turned fiercely upon them, while some\r\nof their number threw open the sluices of the Xenil. In an instant the\r\ncanal which encircled and the ditches which traversed the garden were\r\nfilled with water, and the valiant bishop and his followers found\r\nthemselves overwhelmed by a deluge.* A scene of great confusion\r\nsucceeded. Some of the men of Jaen, stoutest of heart and hand, fought\r\nwith the Moors in the garden, while others struggled with the water,\r\nendeavoring to escape across the canal, in which attempt many horses\r\nwere drowned.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Pulgar.\r\n\r\n\r\nFortunately, the duke del Infantado perceived the snare into which\r\nhis companions had fallen, and despatched his light cavalry to their\r\nassistance. The Moors were compelled to flight, and driven along the\r\nroad of Elvira up to the gates of Granada.* Several Christian cavaliers\r\nperished in this affray; the bishop himself escaped with difficulty,\r\nhaving slipped from his saddle in crossing the canal, but saving himself\r\nby holding on to the tail of his charger. This perilous achievement\r\nseems to have satisfied the good bishop’s belligerent propensities. He\r\nretired on his laurels (says Agapida) to his city of Jaen, where, in the\r\nfruition of all good things, he gradually waxed too corpulent for his\r\ncorselet, which was hung up in the hall of his episcopal palace, and we\r\nhear no more of his military deeds throughout the residue of the holy\r\nwar of Granada.**\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Pulgar.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * * “Don Luis Osorio fue obispo de Jaen desde el ano de 1483, y\r\npresidio in esta. Iglesia hasta el de 1496 in que murio en Flandes, a\r\ndonde fue acompanando a la princesa Dona Juana, esposa del archiduque\r\nDon Felipe.”--“Espana Sagrada,” por Fr. M. Risco, tom. 41, trat. 77,\r\ncap. 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nKing Ferdinand, having completed his ravage of the Vega and kept El\r\nZagal shut up in his capital, conducted his army back through the Pass\r\nof Lope to rejoin Queen Isabella at Moclin.\r\n\r\nThe fortresses lately taken being well garrisoned and supplied, he\r\ngave the command of the frontier to his cousin, Don Fadrique de Toledo,\r\nafterward so famous in the Netherlands as the duke of Alva. The campaign\r\nbeing thus completely crowned with success, the sovereigns returned in\r\ntriumph to the city of Cordova.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\nATTEMPT OF EL ZAGAL UPON THE LIFE OF BOABDIL, AND HOW THE LATTER WAS\r\nROUSED TO ACTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo sooner did the last squadron of Christian cavalry disappear behind\r\nthe mountains of Elvira and the note of its trumpets die away upon the\r\near than the long-suppressed wrath of Muley el Zagal burst forth. He\r\ndetermined no longer to be half a king, reigning over a divided kingdom\r\nin a divided capital, but to exterminate by any means, fair or foul,\r\nhis nephew Boabdil and his faction. He turned furiously upon those whose\r\nfactious conduct had deterred him from sallying upon the foe: some he\r\npunished by confiscations, others by banishment, others by death. Once\r\nundisputed monarch of the entire kingdom, he trusted to his military\r\nskill to retrieve his fortunes and drive the Christians over the\r\nfrontier.\r\n\r\nBoabdil, however, had again retired to Velez el Blanco, on the confines\r\nof Murcia, where he could avail himself, in case of emergency, of any\r\nassistance or protection afforded him by the policy of Ferdinand. His\r\ndefeat had blighted his reviving fortunes, for the people considered him\r\nas inevitably doomed to misfortune. Still, while he lived El Zagal knew\r\nhe would be a rallying-point for faction, and liable at any moment to\r\nbe elevated into power by the capricious multitude. He had recourse,\r\ntherefore, to the most perfidious means to compass his destruction. He\r\nsent ambassadors to him representing the necessity of concord for the\r\nsalvation of the kingdom, and even offering to resign the title of king\r\nand to become subject to his sway on receiving some estate on which he\r\ncould live in tranquil retirement. But while the ambassadors bore these\r\nwords of peace they were furnished with poisoned herbs, which they were\r\nto administer secretly to Boabdil, and if they failed in this attempt\r\nthey had pledged themselves to despatch him openly while engaged in\r\nconversation. They were instigated to this treason by promises of great\r\nreward, and by assurances from the alfaquis that Boabdil was an apostate\r\nwhose death would be acceptable to Heaven.\r\n\r\nThe young monarch was secretly apprised of the concerted treason, and\r\nrefused an audience to the ambassadors. He denounced his uncle as the\r\nmurderer of his father and his kindred and the usurper of his throne,\r\nand vowed never to relent in hostility to him until he should place his\r\nhead on the walls of the Alhambra.\r\n\r\nOpen war again broke out between the two monarchs, though feebly carried\r\non in consequence of their mutual embarrassments. Ferdinand again\r\nextended his assistance to Boabdil, ordering the commanders of his\r\nfortresses to aid him in all enterprises against his uncle, and against\r\nsuch places as refused to acknowledge him as king; and Don Juan de\r\nBonavides, who commanded in Lorca, even made inroads in his name into\r\nthe territories of Almeria, Baza, and Guadix, which owned allegiance to\r\nEl Zagal.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Boabdil had three great evils to contend with--the\r\ninconstancy of his subjects, the hostility of his uncle, and the\r\nfriendship of Ferdinand. The last was by far the most baneful: his\r\nfortunes withered under it. He was looked upon as the enemy of his faith\r\nand of his country. The cities shut their gates against him; the people\r\ncursed him; even the scanty band of cavaliers who had hitherto followed\r\nhis ill-starred banner began to desert him, for he had not wherewithal\r\nto reward nor even to support them. His spirits sank with his fortune,\r\nand he feared that in a little time he should not have a spot of earth\r\nwhereon to plant his standard nor an adherent to rally under it.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of his despondency he received a message from his\r\nlion-hearted mother, the sultana Ayxa la Horra. It was brought by the\r\nsteadfast adherent to their fortunes, Aben Comixa. “For shame,” said\r\nshe, “to linger timorously about the borders of your kingdom when a\r\nusurper is seated in your capital! Why look abroad for perfidious aid\r\nwhen you have loyal hearts beating true to you in Granada? The\r\nAlbaycin is ready to throw open its gates to receive you. Strike home\r\nvigorously--a sudden blow may mend all or make an end. A throne or a\r\ngrave!--for a king there is no honorable medium.”\r\n\r\nBoabdil was of an undecided character, but there are circumstances which\r\nbring the most wavering to a decision, and when once resolved they are\r\napt to act with a daring impulse unknown to steadier judgments. The\r\nmessage of the sultana roused him from a dream. Granada, beautiful\r\nGranada, with its stately Alhambra, its delicious gardens, its gushing\r\nand limpid fountains sparkling among groves of orange, citron, and\r\nmyrtle, rose before him. “What have I done,” exclaimed he, “that I\r\nshould be an exile from this paradise of my forefathers--a wanderer and\r\nfugitive in my own kingdom, while a murderous usurper sits proudly upon\r\nmy throne? Surely Allah will befriend the righteous cause; one blow, and\r\nall may be my own.”\r\n\r\nHe summoned his scanty band of cavaliers. “Who is ready to follow his\r\nmonarch unto the death?” said he; and every one laid his hand upon his\r\nscimetar. “Enough!” said he; “let each man arm himself and prepare his\r\nsteed in secret for an enterprise of toil and peril; if we succeed, our\r\nreward is empire.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\nHOW BOABDIL RETURNED SECRETLY TO GRANADA, AND HOW HE WAS\r\nRECEIVED.--SECOND EMBASSY OF DON JUAN DE VERA, AND HIS PERILS IN THE\r\nALHAMBRA.\r\n\r\n\r\n“In the hand of God,” exclaimed an old Arabian chronicler, “is the\r\ndestiny of princes; he alone giveth empire. A Moorish horseman, mounted\r\non a fleet Arabian steed, was one day traversing the mountains which\r\nextended between Granada and the frontier of Murcia. He galloped swiftly\r\nthrough the valleys, but paused and looked out cautiously from the\r\nsummit of every height. A squadron of cavaliers followed warily at\r\na distance. There were fifty lances. The richness of their armor and\r\nattire showed them to be warriors of noble rank, and their leader had\r\na lofty and prince-like demeanor.” The squadron thus described by\r\nthe Arabian chronicler was the Moorish king Boabdil and his devoted\r\nfollowers.\r\n\r\nFor two nights and a day they pursued their adventurous journey,\r\navoiding all populous parts of the country and choosing the most\r\nsolitary passes of the mountains. They suffered severe hardships and\r\nfatigues, but suffered without a murmur: they were accustomed to rugged\r\ncampaigning, and their steeds were of generous and unyielding spirit.\r\nIt was midnight, and all was dark and silent as they descended from the\r\nmountains and approached the city of Granada. They passed along quietly\r\nunder the shadow of its walls, until they arrived near the gate of\r\nthe Albaycin. Here Boabdil ordered his followers to halt and remain\r\nconcealed. Taking but four or five with him, he advanced resolutely to\r\nthe gate and knocked with the hilt of his scimetar. The guards demanded\r\nwho sought to enter at that unseasonable hour. “Your king!” exclaimed\r\nBoabdil; “open the gate and admit him!”\r\n\r\nThe guards held forth a light and recognized the person of the youthful\r\nmonarch. They were struck with sudden awe and threw open the gates,\r\nand Boabdil and his followers entered unmolested. They galloped to the\r\ndwellings of the principal inhabitants of the Albaycin, thundering\r\nat their portals and summoning them to arise and take arms for their\r\nrightful sovereign. The summons was instantly obeyed: trumpets resounded\r\nthroughout the streets--the gleam of torches and the flash of arms\r\nshowed the Moors hurrying to their gathering-places; by daybreak the\r\nwhole force of the Albaycin was rallied under the standard of Boabdil,\r\nand Aben Comixa was made alcayde of the fortress. Such was the success\r\nof this sudden and desperate act of the young monarch, for we are\r\nassured by contemporary historians that there had been no previous\r\nconcert or arrangement. “As the guards opened the gates of the city to\r\nadmit him,” observes a pious chronicler, “so God opened the hearts of\r\nthe Moors to receive him as their king.” *\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Pulgar.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the morning early the tidings of this event roused El Zagal from his\r\nslumbers in the Alhambra. The fiery old warrior assembled his guard in\r\nhaste and made his way, sword in hand, to the Albaycin, hoping to come\r\nupon his nephew by surprise. He was vigorously met by Boabdil and\r\nhis adherents, and driven back into the quarter of the Alhambra. An\r\nencounter took place between the two kings in the square before the\r\nprincipal mosque; here they fought hand to hand with implacable fury, as\r\nthough it had been agreed to decide their competition for the crown by\r\nsingle combat. In the tumult of this chance-medley affray, however, they\r\nwere separated, and the party of El Zagal was ultimately driven from the\r\nsquare.\r\n\r\nThe battle raged for some time in the streets and places of the city,\r\nbut, finding their powers of mischief cramped within such narrow limits,\r\nboth parties sallied forth into the fields and fought beneath the walls\r\nuntil evening. Many fell on both sides, and at night each party\r\nwithdrew into its quarter until the morning gave them light to renew the\r\nunnatural conflict. For several days the two grand divisions of the city\r\nremained like hostile powers arrayed against each other. The party of\r\nthe Alhambra was more numerous than that of the Albaycin, and contained\r\nmost of the nobility and chivalry; but the adherents of Boabdil were\r\nmen hardened and strengthened by labor and habitually skilled in the\r\nexercise of arms.\r\n\r\nThe Albaycin underwent a kind of siege by the forces of El Zagal; they\r\neffected breaches in the walls, and made repeated attempts to carry it\r\nsword in hand, but were as often repulsed. The troops of Boabdil, on the\r\nother hand, made frequent sallies, and in the conflicts which took\r\nplace the hatred of the combatants arose to such a pitch of fury that no\r\nquarter was given on either side.\r\n\r\nBoabdil perceived the inferiority of his force; he dreaded also that his\r\nadherents, being for the most part tradesmen and artisans, would\r\nbecome impatient of this interruption of their gainful occupations and\r\ndisheartened by these continual scenes of carnage. He sent missives,\r\ntherefore, in all haste to Don Fadrique de Toledo, who commanded the\r\nChristian forces on the frontier, entreating his assistance.\r\n\r\nDon Fadrique had received instructions from the politic Ferdinand to\r\naid the youthful monarch in all his contests with his uncle. He advanced\r\nwith a body of troops near to Granada. The moment Boabdil discerned,\r\nfrom the towers of the Albaycin, the Christian banners and lances\r\nwinding round the base of the mountain of Elvira, he sallied forth to\r\nmeet them, escorted by a squadron of Abencerrages under Aben Comixa.\r\nEl Zagal, who was equally on the alert, and apprised that the Christian\r\ntroops came in aid of his nephew, likewise sallied forth and drew up his\r\ntroops in battle array. Don Fadrique, wary lest some treachery should be\r\nintended, halted among some plantations of olives, retained Boabdil by\r\nhis side, and signified his wish that Aben Comixa would advance with his\r\nsquadron and offer battle to the old king. The provocation was given,\r\nbut El Zagal maintained his position. He threw out some light parties,\r\nhowever, which skirmished with the Abencerrages of Aben Comixa, after\r\nwhich he caused his trumpets to sound a recall, and retired into the\r\ncity, mortified, it is said, that the Christian cavaliers should witness\r\nthese fratricidal discords between true believers.\r\n\r\nDon Fadrique, still distrustful, drew off to a distance, and encamped\r\nfor the night near the bridge of Cabillas.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning a Moorish cavalier with an escort approached the\r\nadvance guard, and his trumpets sounded a parley. He craved an audience\r\nas an envoy from El Zagal, and was admitted to the tent of Don Fadrique.\r\nEl Zagal had learnt that the Christian troops had come to aid his\r\nnephew, and now offered to enter into an alliance with them on terms\r\nstill more advantageous than those of Boabdil. The wary Don Fadrique\r\nlistened to the Moor with apparent complacency, but determined to send\r\none of his most intrepid and discreet cavaliers, under the protection of\r\na flag, to hold a conference with the old king within the very walls of\r\nthe Alhambra. The officer chosen for this important mission was Don Juan\r\nde Vera, the same stanch and devout cavalier who in times preceding the\r\nwar had borne the message from the Castilian sovereigns to old Muley\r\nAbul Hassan demanding arrears of tribute. Don Juan was received\r\nwith great ceremony by the king. No records remain of his diplomatic\r\nnegotiations, but they extended into the night, and, it being too late\r\nto return to camp, he was sumptuously lodged in an apartment of the\r\nAlhambra. In the morning one of the courtiers about the palace, somewhat\r\ngiven to jest and raillery, invited Don Juan to a ceremony which some\r\nof the alfaquis were about to celebrate in the mosque of the palace.\r\nThe religious punctilio of this most discreet cavalier immediately took\r\numbrage at what he conceived a banter. “The servants of Queen Isabella\r\nof Castile,” replied he, stiffly and sternly, “who bear on their armor\r\nthe cross of St. Jago, never enter the temples of Mahomet but to level\r\nthem to the earth and trample on them.”\r\n\r\nThe Moslem courtier retired somewhat disconcerted by this Catholic but\r\nnot very courteous reply, and reported it to a renegado of Antiquera.\r\nThe latter, eager, like all renegados, to show devotion to his\r\nnewly-adopted creed, volunteered to return with the courtier and have a\r\ntilt of words with the testy diplomatist. They found Don Juan playing\r\na game of chess with the alcayde of the Alhambra, and took occasion to\r\nindulge in sportive comments on some of the mysteries of the Christian\r\nreligion. The ire of this devout knight and discreet ambassador began\r\nto kindle, but he restrained it within the limits of lofty gravity.\r\n“You would do well,” said he, “to cease talking about what you do not\r\nunderstand.” This only provoked light attacks of the witlings, until one\r\nof them dared to make some degrading and obscene comparison between the\r\nBlessed Virgin and Amina, the mother of Mahomet. In an instant Don Juan\r\nsprang to his feet, dashed chess-board and chess-men aside, and, drawing\r\nhis sword, dealt, says the curate of los Palacios, such a “fermosa\r\ncuchillada” (such a handsome slash) across the head of the blaspheming\r\nMoor as felled him to the earth. The renegado, seeing his comrade\r\nfall, fled for his life, making the halls and galleries ring with his\r\noutcries. Guards, pages, and attendants rushed in, but Don Juan\r\nkept them at bay until the appearance of the king restored order.\r\nOn inquiring into the cause of the affray he acted with proper\r\ndiscrimination. Don Juan was held sacred as an ambassador, and the\r\nrenegado was severely punished for having compromised the hospitality of\r\nthe royal palace.\r\n\r\nThe tumult in the Alhambra, however, soon caused a more dangerous tumult\r\nin the city. It was rumored that Christians had been introduced into\r\nthe palace with some treasonable design. The populace caught up arms and\r\nascended in throngs to the Gate of Justice, demanding the death of all\r\nChristian spies and those who had introduced them. This was no time\r\nto reason with an infuriate mob, when the noise of their clamors might\r\nbring the garrison of the Albaycin to back them. Nothing was left for\r\nEl Zagal but to furnish Don Juan with a disguise, a swift horse, and an\r\nescort, and to let him out of the Alhambra by a private gate. It was\r\na sore grievance to the stately cavalier to have to submit to these\r\nexpedients, but there was no alternative. In Moorish disguise he passed\r\nthrough crowds that were clamoring for his head, and, once out of the\r\ngate of the city, gave reins to his horse, nor ceased spurring until he\r\nfound himself safe under the banners of Don Fadrique.\r\n\r\nThus ended the second embassy of Don Juan de Vera, less stately but more\r\nperilous than the first. Don Fadrique extolled his prowess, whatever\r\nhe may have thought of his discretion, and rewarded him with a superb\r\nhorse, while at the same time he wrote a letter to El Zagal thanking him\r\nfor the courtesy and protection he had observed to his ambassador. Queen\r\nIsabella also was particularly delighted with the piety of Don Juan and\r\nhis promptness in vindicating the immaculate character of the Blessed\r\nVirgin, and, besides conferring on him various honorable distinctions,\r\nmade him a royal present of three hundred thousand maravedis.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Alcantara, Hist. Granad., vol. 3, c. 17, apud De Harro, Nobiliario\r\nGenealogico, lib. 5, cap. 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe report brought by this cavalier of affairs in Granada, together\r\nwith the preceding skirmishings between the Moorish factions before the\r\nwalls, convinced Don Fadrique that there was no collusion between the\r\nmonarchs: on returning to his frontier post, therefore, he sent Boabdil\r\na reinforcement of Christian foot-soldiers and arquebusiers, under\r\nFernan Alvarez de Sotomayor, alcayde of Colomera. This was as a\r\nfirebrand thrown in to light up anew the flames of war in the city,\r\nwhich remained raging between the Moorish inhabitants for the space of\r\nfifty days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\nHOW KING FERDINAND LAID SIEGE TO VELEZ MALAGA.\r\n\r\n\r\nHitherto the events of this renowned war have been little else than a\r\nsuccession of brilliant but brief exploits, such as sudden forays,\r\nwild skirmishes among the mountains, and the surprisals of castles,\r\nfortresses, and frontier towns. We approach now to more important and\r\nprolonged operations, in which ancient and mighty cities, the bulwarks\r\nof Granada, were invested by powerful armies, subdued by slow and\r\nregular sieges, and thus the capital left naked and alone.\r\n\r\nThe glorious triumphs of the Christian sovereigns (says Fray Antonio\r\nAgapida) had resounded throughout the East and filled all heathenesse\r\nwith alarm. The Grand Turk, Bajazet II., and his deadly foe, the grand\r\nsoldan of Egypt, suspending for a time their bloody feuds, entered into\r\na league to protect the religion of Mahomet and the kingdom of Granada\r\nfrom the hostilities of the Christians. It was concerted between them\r\nthat Bajazet should send a powerful armada against the island of Sicily,\r\nthen appertaining to the Spanish Crown, for the purpose of distracting\r\nthe attention of the Castilian sovereigns, while at the same time great\r\nbodies of troops should be poured into Granada from the opposite coast\r\nof Africa.\r\n\r\nFerdinand and Isabella received timely intelligence of these designs.\r\nThey resolved at once to carry the war into the sea-board of Granada, to\r\npossess themselves of its ports, and thus, as it were, to bar the gates\r\nof the kingdom against all external aid. Malaga was to be the main\r\nobject of attack: it was the principal seaport of the kingdom, and\r\nalmost necessary to its existence. It had long been the seat of opulent\r\ncommerce, sending many ships to the coasts of Syria and Egypt. It was\r\nalso the great channel of communication with Africa, through which\r\nwere introduced supplies of money, troops, arms, and steeds from Tunis,\r\nTripoli, Fez, Tremezan, and other Barbary powers. It was emphatically\r\ncalled, therefore, “the hand and mouth of Granada.” Before laying siege\r\nto this redoubtable city, however, it was deemed necessary to secure the\r\nneighboring city of Velez Malaga and its dependent places, which might\r\notherwise harass the besieging army.\r\n\r\nFor this important campaign the nobles of the kingdom were again\r\nsummoned to take the field with their forces in the spring of 1487.\r\nThe menaced invasion of the infidel powers of the East had awakened new\r\nardor in the bosoms of all true Christian knights, and so zealously did\r\nthey respond to the summons of the sovereigns that an army of twenty\r\nthousand cavalry and fifty thousand foot, the flower of Spanish\r\nwarriors, led by the bravest of Spanish cavaliers, thronged the renowned\r\ncity of Cordova at the appointed time.\r\n\r\nOn the night before this mighty host set forth upon its march an\r\nearthquake shook the city. The inhabitants, awakened by the shaking of\r\nthe walls and rocking of the towers, fled to the courts and squares,\r\nfearing to be overwhelmed by the ruins of their dwellings. The\r\nearthquake was most violent in the quarter of the royal residence, the\r\nsite of the ancient palace of the Moorish kings. Many looked upon this\r\nas an omen of some impending evil; but Fray Antonio Agapida, in that\r\ninfallible spirit of divination which succeeds an event, plainly reads\r\nin it a presage that the empire of the Moors was about to be shaken to\r\nits centre.\r\n\r\nIt was on Saturday, the eve of the Sunday of Palms (says a worthy and\r\nloyal chronicler of the time), that the most Catholic monarch departed\r\nwith his army to render service to Heaven and make war upon the Moors.*\r\nHeavy rains had swelled all the streams and rendered the roads deep and\r\ndifficult. The king, therefore, divided his host into two bodies. In\r\none he put all the artillery, guarded by a strong body of horse, and\r\ncommanded by the master of Alcantara and Martin Alonso, senior of\r\nMontemayor. This division was to proceed by the road through the\r\nvalleys, where pasturage abounded for the oxen which drew the ordnance.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Pulgar, Cronica de los Reyes Catholicos.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main body of the army was led by the king in person. It was divided\r\ninto numerous battalions, each commanded by some distinguished cavalier.\r\nThe king took the rough and perilous road of the mountains, and few\r\nmountains are more rugged and difficult than those of Andalusia. The\r\nroads are mere mule-paths straggling amidst rocks and along the verge of\r\nprecipices, clambering vast craggy heights, or descending into frightful\r\nchasms and ravines, with scanty and uncertain foothold for either man or\r\nsteed. Four thousand pioneers were sent in advance, under the alcayde de\r\nlos Donceles, to conquer in some degree the asperities of the road. Some\r\nhad pickaxes and crowbars to break the rocks, others had implements to\r\nconstruct bridges over the mountain-torrents, while it was the duty of\r\nothers to lay stepping-stones in the smaller streams. As the country\r\nwas inhabited by fierce Moorish mountaineers, Don Diego de Castrillo\r\nwas despatched with a body of horse and foot to take possession of the\r\nheights and passes. Notwithstanding every precaution, the royal army\r\nsuffered excessively on its march. At one time there was no place to\r\nencamp for five leagues of the most toilsome and mountainous country,\r\nand many of the beasts of burden sank down and perished on the road.\r\n\r\nIt was with the greatest joy, therefore, that the royal army emerged\r\nfrom these stern and frightful defiles, and came to where they looked\r\ndown upon the vega of Velez Malaga. The region before them was one\r\nof the most delectable to the eye that ever was ravaged by an army.\r\nSheltered from every rude blast by a screen of mountains, and sloping\r\nand expanding to the south, this lovely valley was quickened by the most\r\ngenerous sunshine, watered by the silver meanderings of the Velez, and\r\nrefreshed by cooling breezes from the Mediterranean. The sloping hills\r\nwere covered with vineyards and olive trees; the distant fields waved\r\nwith grain or were verdant with pasturage; while round the city were\r\ndelightful gardens, the favorite retreats of the Moors, where\r\ntheir white pavilions gleamed among groves of oranges, citrons, and\r\npomegranates, and were surrounded by stately palms--those plants of\r\nsouthern growth bespeaking a generous climate and a cloudless sky.\r\n\r\nIn the upper part of this delightful valley the city of Velez Malaga\r\nreared its warrior battlements in stern contrast to the landscape. It\r\nwas built on the declivity of a steep and insulated hill, and strongly\r\nfortified by walls and towers. The crest of the hill rose high above the\r\ntown into a mere crag, inaccessible on every other side, and crowned by\r\na powerful castle, which domineered over the surrounding country. Two\r\nsuburbs swept down into the valley from the skirts of the town, and\r\nwere defended by bulwarks and deep ditches. The vast ranges of gray\r\nmountains, often capped with clouds, which rose to the north, were\r\ninhabited by a hardy and warlike race, whose strong fortresses of\r\nComares, Canillas, Competa, and Benamargosa frowned down from cragged\r\nheights.\r\n\r\nWhen the Christian host arrived in sight of this valley, a squadron was\r\nhovering on the smooth sea before it displaying the banner of Castile.\r\nThis was commanded by the count of Trevento, and consisted of four armed\r\ngalleys, convoying a number of caravels laden with supplies for the\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nAfter surveying the ground, King Ferdinand encamped on the side of a\r\nmountain which advanced close to the city, and was the last of a rugged\r\nsierra, or chain of heights, that extended quite to Granada. On the\r\nsummit of this mountain, and overlooking the camp, was a Moorish town,\r\npowerfully fortified, called Bentomiz, considered capable of yielding\r\ngreat assistance to Velez Malaga. Several of the generals remonstrated\r\nwith the king for choosing a post so exposed to assaults from\r\nthe mountaineers, but he replied that he should thus cut off all\r\ncommunication between Bentomiz and the city, and that, as to the danger,\r\nhis soldiers must keep the more vigilant guard against surprise.\r\n\r\nKing Ferdinand rode about, attended by several cavaliers and a small\r\nnumber of cuirassiers, appointing the various stations of the camp.\r\nHaving directed a body of foot-soldiers to possess themselves, as an\r\nadvanced guard, of an important height which overlooked the city, he\r\nretired to a tent to take refreshment. While at table he was startled by\r\na sudden uproar, and, looking forth, beheld his soldiers flying before\r\na superior force of the enemy. The king had on no other armor but a\r\ncuirass: seizing a lance, however, he sprang upon his horse and galloped\r\nto protect the fugitives, followed by his handful of knights and\r\ncuirassiers. When the soldiers saw the king hastening to their aid, they\r\nturned upon their pursuers. Ferdinand in his eagerness threw himself\r\ninto the midst of the foe. One of his grooms was killed beside him, but\r\nbefore the Moor who slew him could escape the king transfixed him\r\nwith his lance. He then sought to draw his sword, which hung at his\r\nsaddle-bow, but in vain. Never had he been exposed to such peril; he was\r\nsurrounded by the enemy without a weapon wherewith to defend himself.\r\n\r\nIn this moment of awful jeopardy the marques of Cadiz, the count\r\nde Cabra, the adelantado of Murcia, with two other cavaliers, named\r\nGarcilasso de la Vega and Diego de Atayde, came galloping to the scene\r\nof action, and, surrounding the king, made a rampart of their bodies\r\nagainst the assaults of the Moors. The horse of the marques was pierced\r\nby an arrow, and that worthy cavalier exposed to imminent danger; but\r\nwith the aid of his valorous companions he quickly put the enemy to\r\nflight, and pursued them with slaughter to the very gates of the city.\r\n\r\nWhen those loyal warriors returned from the pursuit they remonstrated\r\nwith the king for exposing his life in personal conflict, seeing that\r\nhe had so many valiant captains whose business it was to fight. They\r\nreminded him that the life of a prince was the life of his people,\r\nand that many a brave army was lost by the loss of its commander. They\r\nentreated him, therefore, in future to protect them with the force of\r\nhis mind in the cabinet, rather than of his arm in the field.\r\n\r\nFerdinand acknowledged the wisdom of their advice, but declared that he\r\ncould not see his people in peril without venturing his person to assist\r\nthem--a reply (say the old chroniclers) which delighted the whole army,\r\ninasmuch as they saw that he not only governed them as a good king, but\r\nprotected them as a valiant captain. He, however, was conscious of the\r\nextreme peril to which he had been exposed, and made a vow never again\r\nto venture into battle without having his sword girt to his side.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Illescas, Hist. Pontif., lib. 6, c. 20; Vedmar, Hist. Velez Malaga.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen this achievement of the king was related to Isabella, she trembled\r\namidst her joy at his safety, and afterward, in memorial of the event,\r\ngranted to Velez Malaga, as the arms of the city, the figure of the king\r\non horseback, with a groom lying dead at his feet and the Moors flying.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Ibid.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe camp was formed, but the artillery was yet on the road, advancing\r\nwith infinite labor at the rate of merely a league a day, for heavy\r\nrains had converted the streams of the valleys into raging torrents and\r\ncompletely broken up the roads. In the mean time, King Ferdinand\r\nordered an assault on the suburbs of the city. They were carried after a\r\nsanguinary conflict of six hours, in which many Christian cavaliers were\r\nkilled and wounded, and among the latter Don Alvaro of Portugal, son of\r\nthe duke of Braganza. The suburbs were then fortified toward the city\r\nwith trenches and palisades, and garrisoned by a chosen force under Don\r\nFadrique de Toledo. Other trenches were digged round the city and from\r\nthe suburbs to the royal camp, so as to cut off all communication with\r\nthe surrounding country.\r\n\r\nBodies of troops were also sent to take possession of the\r\nmountain-passes by which the supplies for the army had to be brought.\r\nThe mountains, however, were so steep and rugged, and so full of defiles\r\nand lurking-places, that the Moors could sally forth and retreat in\r\nperfect security, frequently swooping down upon Christian convoys and\r\nbearing off both booty and prisoners to their strongholds. Sometimes the\r\nMoors would light fires at night on the sides of the mountains, which\r\nwould be answered by fires from the watch-towers and fortresses. By\r\nthese signals they would concert assaults upon the Christian camp, which\r\nin consequence was obliged to be continually on the alert.\r\n\r\nKing Ferdinand flattered himself that the manifestation of his force had\r\nstruck sufficient terror into the city, and that by offers of clemency\r\nit might be induced to capitulate. He wrote a letter, therefore, to\r\nthe commanders, promising, in case of immediate surrender, that all\r\nthe inhabitants should be permitted to depart with their effects, but\r\nthreatening them with fire and sword if they persisted in defence. This\r\nletter was despatched by a cavalier named Carvajal, who, putting it on\r\nthe end of a lance, reached it to the Moors on the walls of the city.\r\nAbul Cacim Vanegas, son of Reduan, and alcayde of the fortress, replied\r\nthat the king was too noble and magnanimous to put such a threat in\r\nexecution, and that he should not surrender, as he knew the artillery\r\ncould not be brought to the camp, and he was promised succor by the king\r\nof Granada.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that he received this reply the king learnt that at the\r\nstrong town of Comares, upon a height about two leagues distant from the\r\ncamp, a large number of warriors had assembled from the Axarquia, the\r\nsame mountains in which the Christian cavaliers had been massacred in\r\nthe beginning of the war, and that others were daily expected, for this\r\nrugged sierra was capable of furnishing fifteen thousand fighting-men.\r\n\r\nKing Ferdinand felt that his army, thus disjoined and enclosed in\r\nan enemy’s country, was in a perilous situation, and that the utmost\r\ndiscipline and vigilance were necessary. He put the camp under the\r\nstrictest regulations, forbidding all gaming, blasphemy, or brawl, and\r\nexpelling all loose women and their attendant bully ruffians, the usual\r\nfomenters of riot and contention among soldiery. He ordered that none\r\nshould sally forth to skirmish without permission from their commanders;\r\nthat none should set fire to the woods on the neighboring mountains; and\r\nthat all word of security given to Moorish places or individuals should\r\nbe inviolably observed. These regulations were enforced by severe\r\npenalties, and had such salutary effect that, though a vast host of\r\nvarious people was collected together, not an opprobrious epithet was\r\nheard nor a weapon drawn in quarrel.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the cloud of war continued to gather about the summits\r\nof the mountains, and multitudes of the fierce warriors of the sierra\r\ndescended to the lower heights of Bentomiz, which overhung the camp,\r\nintending to force their way to the city. A detachment was sent against\r\nthem, which, after sharp fighting, drove them to the higher cliffs,\r\nwhere it was impossible to pursue them.\r\n\r\nTen days had elapsed since the encampment of the army, yet still the\r\nartillery had not arrived. The lombards and other heavy ordnance were\r\nleft in despair at Antiquera; the rest came groaning slowly through the\r\nnarrow valleys, which were filled with long trains of artillery and cars\r\nladen with munitions. At length part of the smaller ordnance arrived\r\nwithin half a league of the camp, and the Christians were animated\r\nwith the hopes of soon being able to make a regular attack upon the\r\nfortifications of the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\nHOW KING FERDINAND AND HIS ARMY WERE EXPOSED TO IMMINENT PERIL BEFORE\r\nVELEZ MALAGA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the standard of the cross waved on the hills before Velez Malaga,\r\nand every height and cliff bristled with hostile arms, the civil war\r\nbetween the factions of the Alhambra and the Albaycin, or rather between\r\nEl Zagal and El Chico, continued to convulse the city of Granada. The\r\ntidings of the investment of Velez Malaga at length roused the attention\r\nof the old men and the alfaquis, whose heads were not heated by the\r\ndaily broils, and they endeavored to arouse the people to a sense of\r\ntheir common danger.\r\n\r\n“Why,” said they, “continue these brawls between brethren and kindred?\r\nWhat battles are these where even triumph is ignominious, and the victor\r\nblushes and conceals his scars? Behold the Christians ravaging the land\r\nwon by the valor and blood of your forefathers, dwelling in the houses\r\nthey built, sitting under the trees they planted, while your brethren\r\nwander about houseless and desolate. Do you wish to seek your real\r\nfoe?--he is encamped on the mountain of Bentomiz. Do you want a field\r\nfor the display of your valor?--you will find it before the walls of\r\nVelez Malaga.”\r\n\r\nWhen they had roused the spirit of the people they made their way to\r\nthe rival kings, and addressed them with like remonstrances. Hamet Aben\r\nZarraz, the inspired santon, reproached El Zagal with his blind and\r\nsenseless ambition. “You are striving to be king,” said he, bitterly,\r\n“yet suffer the kingdom to be lost!”\r\n\r\nEl Zagal found himself in a perplexing dilemma. He had a double war to\r\nwage--with the enemy without and the enemy within. Should the Christians\r\ngain possession of the sea-coast, it would be ruinous to the kingdom;\r\nshould he leave Granada to oppose them, his vacant throne might be\r\nseized on by his nephew. He made a merit of necessity, and, pretending\r\nto yield to the remonstrances of the alfaquis, endeavored to compromise\r\nwith Boabdil. He expressed deep concern at the daily losses of the\r\ncountry caused by the dissensions of the capital: an opportunity now\r\npresented to retrieve all by a blow. The Christians had in a manner\r\nput themselves in a tomb between the mountains--nothing remained but to\r\nthrow the earth upon them. He offered to resign the title of king, to\r\nsubmit to the government of his nephew, and fight under his standard;\r\nall he desired was to hasten to the relief of Velez Malaga and to take\r\nfull vengeance on the Christians.\r\n\r\nBoabdil spurned his proposition as the artifice of a hypocrite and a\r\ntraitor. “How shall I trust a man,” said he, “who has murdered my father\r\nand my kindred by treachery, and has repeatedly sought my own life both\r\nby violence and stratagem?”\r\n\r\nEl Zagal boiled with rage and vexation, but there was no time to be\r\nlost. He was beset by the alfaquis and the nobles of his count; the\r\nyouthful cavaliers were hot for action, the common people loud in their\r\ncomplaints that the richest cities were abandoned to the mercy of the\r\nenemy. The old warrior was naturally fond of fighting; he saw also that\r\nto remain inactive would endanger both crown and kingdom, whereas a\r\nsuccessful blow might secure his popularity in Granada. He had a\r\nmuch more powerful force than his nephew, having lately received\r\nreinforcements from Baza, Guadix, and Almeria; he could march with a\r\nlarge force, therefore, to the relief of Velez Malaga, and yet leave a\r\nstrong garrison in the Alhambra. He took his measures accordingly, and\r\ndeparted suddenly in the night at the head of one thousand horse and\r\ntwenty thousand foot, and urged his way rapidly by the most unfrequented\r\nroads along the chain of mountains extending from Granada to the heights\r\nabove Velez Malaga.\r\n\r\nThe Christians were alarmed one evening by the sudden blazing of great\r\nfires on the mountains about the fortress of Bentomiz. By the ruddy\r\nlight they beheld the flash of weapons and the array of troops, and\r\nthey heard the distant sound of Moorish drums and trumpets. The fires\r\nof Bentomiz were answered by fires on the towers of Velez Malaga. The\r\nshouts of “El Zagal! El Zagal!” echoed along the cliffs and resounded\r\nfrom the city, and the Christians found that the old warrior-king of\r\nGranada was on the mountain above the camp.\r\n\r\nThe spirits of the Moors were suddenly raised to a pitch of the greatest\r\nexultation, while the Christians were astonished to see the storm of war\r\nready to burst upon their heads. The count de Cabra, with his accustomed\r\neagerness when there was a king in the field, would fain have scaled the\r\nheights and attacked El Zagal before he had time to form his camp; but\r\nFerdinand, more cool and wary, restrained him. To attack the height\r\nwould be to abandon the siege. He ordered every one, therefore, to keep\r\na vigilant watch at his post and stand ready to defend it to the utmost,\r\nbut on no account to sally forth and attack the enemy.\r\n\r\nAll night the signal-fires kept blazing along the mountains, rousing and\r\nanimating the whole country. The morning sun rose over the lofty summit\r\nof Bentomiz on a scene of martial splendor. As its rays glanced down\r\nthe mountain they lighted up the white tents of the Christian cavaliers\r\ncresting its lower prominences, their pennons and ensigns fluttering in\r\nthe morning breeze. The sumptuous pavilions of the king, with the holy\r\nstandard of the cross and the royal banners of Castile and Aragon,\r\ndominated the encampment. Beyond lay the city, its lofty castle and\r\nnumerous towers glistening with arms, while above all, and just on\r\nthe profile of the height, in the full blaze of the rising sun, were\r\ndescried the tents of the Moor, his troops clustering about them and his\r\ninfidel banners floating against the sky. Columns of smoke rose where\r\nthe night-fires had blazed, and the clash of the Moorish cymbal, the\r\nbray of trumpet, and the neigh of steed were faintly heard from the airy\r\nheights. So pure and transparent is the atmosphere in this region\r\nthat every object can be distinctly seen at a great distance, and the\r\nChristians were able to behold the formidable hosts of fires gathering\r\non the summits of the surrounding mountains.\r\n\r\nOne of the first measures of the Moorish king was to detach a large\r\nforce, under Reduan de Vanegas, alcayde of Granada, to fall upon the\r\nconvoy of ordnance, which stretched for a great distance through the\r\nmountain-defiles. Ferdinand had anticipated this attempt, and sent the\r\ncommander of Leon with a body of horse and foot to reinforce the master\r\nof Alcantara. El Zagal from his mountain-height beheld the detachment\r\nissue from the camp, and immediately recalled Reduan. The armies\r\nnow remained quiet for a time, the Moor looking grimly down upon the\r\nChristian camp, like a tiger meditating a bound upon his prey. The\r\nChristians were in fearful jeopardy--a hostile city below them, a\r\npowerful army above them, and on every side mountains filled with\r\nimplacable foes.\r\n\r\nAfter El Zagal had maturely considered the situation of the Christian\r\ncamp, and informed himself of all the passes of the mountain, he\r\nconceived a plan to surprise the enemy which he flattered himself would\r\nensure their ruin and perhaps the capture of King Ferdinand. He wrote\r\na letter to the alcayde of the city, commanding him in the dead of the\r\nnight, on a signal-fire being made from the mountain, to sally forth\r\nwith all his troops and fall furiously upon the Christian camp. The king\r\nwould, at the same time, rush down with his army from the mountain, and\r\nassail it on the opposite side, thus overwhelming it at the hour of deep\r\nrepose. This letter he despatched by a renegado Christian, who knew all\r\nthe secret roads of the country, and if taken could pass himself for a\r\nChristian who had escaped from captivity.\r\n\r\nEl Zagal, confident in his stratagem, looked down upon the Christians\r\nas his devoted victims. As the sun went down and the long shadows of the\r\nmountains stretched across the vega, he pointed with exultation to the\r\ncamp below, apparently unconscious of the impending danger. “Behold,”\r\n said he, “the unbelievers are delivered into our hands; their king and\r\nchoicest chivalry will soon be at our mercy. Now is the time to show the\r\ncourage of men, and by one glorious victory retrieve all that we have\r\nlost. Happy he who falls fighting in the cause of the Prophet! he will\r\nat once be transported to the paradise of the faithful and surrounded by\r\nimmortal houris. Happy he who shall survive victorious! he will behold\r\nGranada--an earthly paradise!--once more delivered from its foes and\r\nrestored to all its glory.” The words of El Zagal were received with\r\nacclamations by his troops, who waited impatiently for the appointed\r\nhour to pour down from their mountain-hold upon the Christians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\nRESULT OF THE STRATAGEM OF EL ZAGAL TO SURPRISE KING FERDINAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nQueen Isabella and her court had remained at Cordova in great anxiety\r\nfor the result of the royal expedition. Every day brought tidings of\r\nthe difficulties which attended the transportation of the ordnance and\r\nmunitions and of the critical state of the army.\r\n\r\nWhile in this state of anxious suspense couriers arrived with all speed\r\nfrom the frontiers, bringing tidings of the sudden sally of El Zagal\r\nfrom Granada to surprise the camp. All Cordova was in consternation. The\r\ndestruction of the Andalusian chivalry among the mountains of this very\r\nneighborhood was called to mind; it was feared that similar ruin was\r\nabout to burst forth from rocks and precipices upon Ferdinand and his\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nQueen Isabella shared in the public alarm, but it served to rouse all\r\nthe energies of her heroic mind. Instead of uttering idle apprehensions,\r\nshe sought only how to avert the danger. She called upon all the men of\r\nAndalusia under the age of seventy to arm and hasten to the relief of\r\ntheir sovereign, and she prepared to set out with the first levies.\r\nThe grand cardinal of Spain, old Pedro Gonzalez de Mendoza, in whom the\r\npiety of the saint and the wisdom of the counsellor were mingled with\r\nthe fire of the cavalier, offered high pay to all horsemen who would\r\nfollow him to aid their king and the Christian cause, and, buckling on\r\narmor, prepared to lead them to the scene of danger.\r\n\r\nThe summons of the queen roused the quick Andalusian spirit. Warriors\r\nwho had long since given up fighting and had sent their sons to battle\r\nnow seized the sword and lance rusting on the wall, and marshalled forth\r\ntheir gray-headed domestics and their grandchildren for the field. The\r\ngreat dread was, that all aid would arrive too late; El Zagal and his\r\nhost had passed like a storm through the mountains, and it was feared\r\nthe tempest had already burst upon the Christian camp.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the night had closed which had been appointed by El\r\nZagal for the execution of his plan. He had watched the last light of\r\nday expire, and all the Spanish camp remained tranquil. As the hours\r\nwore away the camp-fires were gradually extinguished. No drum nor\r\ntrumpet sounded from below. Nothing was heard but now and then the dull\r\nheavy tread of troops or the echoing tramp of horses--the usual patrols\r\nof the camp--and the changes of the guards. El Zagal restrained his own\r\nimpatience and that of his troops until the night should be advanced\r\nand the camp sunk in that heavy sleep from which men are with difficulty\r\nawakened, and when awakened prone to be bewildered and dismayed.\r\n\r\nAt length the appointed hour arrived. By order of the Moorish king a\r\nbright flame sprang up from the height of Bentomiz, but El Zagal looked\r\nin vain for the responding light from the city. His impatience would\r\nbrook no longer delay; he ordered the advance of the army to descend the\r\nmountain-defile and attack the camp. The defile was narrow and overhung\r\nby rocks; as the troops proceeded they came suddenly, in a shadowy\r\nhollow, upon a dark mass of warriors who, with a loud shout, rushed to\r\nassail them. Surprised and disconcerted, they retreated in confusion to\r\nthe height. When El Zagal heard of a Christian force in the defile, he\r\ndoubted some counter-plan of the enemy, and gave orders to light the\r\nmountain-fires. On a signal given bright flames sprang up on every\r\nheight from pyres of wood prepared for the purpose: cliff blazed out\r\nafter cliff until the whole atmosphere was in a glow of furnace light.\r\n\r\nThe ruddy glare lit up the glens and passes, and fell strongly upon\r\nthe Christian camp, revealing all its tents and every post and bulwark.\r\nWherever El Zagal turned his eyes he beheld the light of his fires\r\nflashed back from cuirass and helm and sparkling lance; he beheld a\r\ngrove of spears planted in every pass, every assailable point bristling\r\nwith arms, and squadrons of horse and foot in battle array awaiting his\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nIn fact, his letter to the alcayde of Velez Malaga had been intercepted\r\nby the vigilant Ferdinand, the renegado messenger hanged, and secret\r\nmeasures taken after nightfall to give the Moors a warm reception. El\r\nZagal saw that his plan of surprise was discovered and foiled; furious\r\nwith disappointment, he ordered his troops forward to the attack.\r\nThey rushed down the defile, but were again encountered by the mass of\r\nChristian warriors, being the advance guard of the army commanded by Don\r\nHurtado de Mendoza, brother of the grand cardinal. The Moors were again\r\nrepulsed, and retreated up the height. Don Hurtado would have followed\r\nthem, but the ascent was steep and rugged and easily defended. A\r\nsharp action was kept up through the night with crossbows, darts, and\r\narquebuses. The cliffs echoed with deafening uproar, while the fires\r\nblazing upon the mountains threw a lurid and uncertain light upon the\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nWhen the day dawned and the Moors saw that there was no co-operation\r\nfrom the city, they slackened in their ardor: they beheld also every\r\npass of the mountain filled with Christian troops, and began to\r\napprehend an assault in return. Just then King Ferdinand sent the\r\nmarques of Cadiz with horse and foot to seize upon a height occupied by\r\na battalion of the enemy. The marques assailed the Moors with his usual\r\nintrepidity, and soon put them to flight. The others, who were above,\r\nseeing their comrades fly, threw down their arms and retreated. One of\r\nthose unaccountable panics which now and then seize upon great bodies\r\nof people, and to which the light-spirited Moors were prone, now spread\r\nthroughout the camp. They were terrified, they knew not why nor at what,\r\nand, throwing away swords, lances, breast-plates, crossbows, everything\r\nthat could impede their motions, scattered themselves wildly in every\r\ndirection. They fled without pursuers--from the glimpse of each other’s\r\narms, from the sound of each other’s footsteps. Reduan de Vanegas, the\r\nbrave alcayde of Granada, alone succeeded in collecting a body of\r\nthe fugitives; he made a circuit with them through the passes of the\r\nmountain, and, forcing his way across a weak part of the Christian\r\nlines, galloped toward Velez Malaga. The rest of the Moorish host was\r\ncompletely scattered. In vain did El Zagal and his knights attempt to\r\nrally them; they were left almost alone, and had to consult their own\r\nsecurity by flight.\r\n\r\nThe marques of Cadiz, finding no opposition, ascended from height\r\nto height, cautiously reconnoitring and fearful of some stratagem or\r\nambush. All, however, was quiet. He reached with his men the place which\r\nthe Moorish army had occupied: the heights were abandoned and strewed\r\nwith cuirasses, scimetars, crossbows, and other weapons. His force was\r\ntoo small to pursue the enemy, but returned to the royal camp laden with\r\nspoils.\r\n\r\nFerdinand at first could not credit so signal and miraculous a defeat,\r\nbut suspected some lurking stratagem. He ordered, therefore, that a\r\nstrict watch should be maintained throughout the camp and every one be\r\nready for instant action. The following night a thousand cavaliers and\r\nhidalgos kept guard about the royal tent, as they had done for several\r\npreceding nights; nor did the king relax this vigilance until he\r\nreceived certain intelligence that the enemy was completely scattered\r\nand El Zagal flying in confusion.\r\n\r\nThe tidings of this rout and of the safety of the Christian army arrived\r\nat Cordova just as reinforcements were on the point of setting out. The\r\nanxiety and alarm of the queen and the public were turned to transports\r\nof joy and gratitude. The forces were disbanded, solemn processions were\r\nmade, and “Te Deums” chanted in the churches for so signal a victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\n\r\nHOW THE PEOPLE OF GRANADA REWARDED THE VALOR OF EL ZAGAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe daring spirit of Muley Abdallah el Zagal in sallying forth to defend\r\nhis territories while he left an armed rival in his capital struck the\r\npeople of Granada with admiration. They recalled his former exploits,\r\nand again anticipated some hardy achievement from his valor. Couriers\r\nfrom the army reported its formidable position on the height of\r\nBentomiz. For a time there was a pause in the bloody commotions of the\r\ncity; all attention was turned to the blow about to be struck at the\r\nChristian camp. The same considerations which diffused anxiety and\r\nterror through Cordova swelled every bosom with exulting confidence in\r\nGranada. The Moors expected to hear of another massacre like that in the\r\nmountains of Malaga. “El Zagal has again entrapped the enemy!” was the\r\ncry. “The power of the unbelievers is about to be struck to the heart.\r\nWe shall soon see the Christian king led captive to the capital.” Thus\r\nwas the name of El Zagal on every tongue. He was extolled as the savior\r\nof the country, the only one worthy of wearing the Moorish crown.\r\nBoabdil was reviled as basely remaining passive while his country\r\nwas invaded and so violent became the clamor of the populace that his\r\nadherents trembled for his safety.\r\n\r\nWhile the people of Granada were impatiently looking out for tidings\r\nof the anticipated victory scattered horsemen came spurring across the\r\nVega. They were fugitives from the Moorish army, and brought the first\r\nincoherent account of its defeat. Every one who attempted to tell the\r\ntale of this unaccountable panic and dispersion was as if bewildered by\r\nthe broken recollection of some frightful dream. He knew not how or why\r\nit came to pass. He talked of a battle in the night, among rocks and\r\nprecipices, by the glare of bale-fires; of multitudes of armed foes in\r\nevery pass, seen by gleams and flashes; of the sudden horror that seized\r\nupon the army at daybreak, its headlong flight, and total dispersion.\r\nHour after hour the arrival of other fugitives confirmed the story of\r\nruin and disgrace.\r\n\r\nIn proportion to their recent vaunting was the humiliation that now fell\r\nupon the people of Granada. There was a universal burst, not of grief,\r\nbut indignation. They confounded the leader with the army--the deserted\r\nwith those who had abandoned him, and El Zagal, from being their idol,\r\nbecame suddenly the object of their execration. He had sacrificed the\r\narmy; he had disgraced the nation; he had betrayed the country. He was a\r\ndastard, a traitor; he was unworthy to reign.\r\n\r\nOn a sudden one among the multitude shouted, “Long live Boabdil el\r\nChico!” The cry was echoed on all sides, and every one shouted, “Long\r\nlive Boabdil el Chico! long live the legitimate king of Granada! and\r\ndeath to all usurpers!” In the excitement of the moment they thronged\r\nto the Albaycin, and those who had lately besieged Boabdil with arms now\r\nsurrounded his palace with acclamations. The keys of the city and of\r\nall the fortresses were laid at his feet; he was borne in state to the\r\nAlhambra, and once more seated with all due ceremony on the throne of\r\nhis ancestors.\r\n\r\nBoabdil had by this time become so accustomed to be crowned and\r\nuncrowned by the multitude that he put no great faith in the duration of\r\ntheir loyalty. He knew that he was surrounded by hollow hearts, and\r\nthat most of the courtiers of the Alhambra were secretly devoted to his\r\nuncle. He ascended the throne as the rightful sovereign who had been\r\ndispossessed of it by usurpation, and he ordered the heads of four\r\nof the principal nobles to be struck off who had been most zealous in\r\nsupport of the (9) usurper. Executions of the kind were matters of course\r\non any change in Moorish government, and Boabdil was lauded for his\r\nmoderation and humanity in being content with so small a sacrifice.\r\nThe factions were awed into obedience; the populace, delighted with any\r\nchange, extolled Boabdil to the skies; and the name of Muley Abdallah\r\nel Zagal was for a time a by-word of scorn and opprobrium throughout the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nNever was any commander more astonished and confounded by a sudden\r\nreverse of fortune than El Zagal. The evening had seen him with a\r\npowerful army at his command, his enemy within his grasp, and victory\r\nabout to cover him with glory and to consolidate his power: the morning\r\nbeheld him a fugitive among the mountains, his army, his prosperity, his\r\npower, all dispelled, he knew not how--gone like a dream of the night.\r\nIn vain had he tried to stem the headlong flight of the army. He saw\r\nhis squadrons breaking and dispersing among the cliffs of the mountains,\r\nuntil of all his host only a handful of cavaliers remained faithful.\r\nWith these he made a gloomy retreat toward Granada, but with a heart\r\nfull of foreboding. As he drew near to the city he paused on the\r\nbanks of the Xenil and sent forth scouts to collect intelligence. They\r\nreturned with dejected countenances. “The gates of Granada,” said they,\r\n“are closed against you. The banner of Boabdil floats on the tower of\r\nthe Alhambra.”\r\n\r\nEl Zagal turned his steed and departed in silence. He retreated to the\r\ntown of Almunecar, and thence to Almeria, which places still remained\r\nfaithful to him. Restless and uneasy at being so distant from the\r\ncapital, he again changed his abode, and repaired to the city of Guadix,\r\nwithin a few leagues of Granada. Here he remained, endeavoring to rally\r\nhis forces and preparing to avail himself of any sudden change in the\r\nfluctuating politics of the metropolis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\n\r\nSURRENDER OF VELEZ MALAGA AND OTHER PLACES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe people of Velez Malaga had beheld the camp of Muley Abdallah\r\ncovering the summit of Bentomiz and glittering in the last rays of the\r\nsetting sun. During the night they had been alarmed and perplexed by\r\nsignal-fires on the mountain and by the sound of distant battle. When\r\nthe morning broke the Moorish army had vanished as if by enchantment.\r\nWhile the inhabitants were lost in wonder and conjecture, a body of\r\ncavalry, the fragment of the army saved by Reduan de Vanegas, the brave\r\nalcayde of Granada, came galloping to the gates. The tidings of the\r\nstrange discomfiture of the host filled the city with consternation, but\r\nReduan exhorted the people to continue their resistance. He was devoted\r\nto El Zagal and confident in his skill and prowess, and felt assured\r\nthat he would soon collect his scattered forces and return with\r\nfresh troops from Granada. The people were comforted by the words and\r\nencouraged by the presence of Reduan, and they had still a lingering\r\nhope that the heavy artillery of the Christians might be locked up in\r\nthe impassable defiles of the mountains. This hope was soon at an end.\r\nThe very next day they beheld long laborious lines of ordnance slowly\r\nmoving into the Spanish camp--lombards, ribadoquines, catapults, and\r\ncars laden with munitions--while the escort, under the brave master\r\nof Alcantara, wheeled in great battalions into the camp to augment the\r\nforce of the besiegers.\r\n\r\nThe intelligence that Granada had shut its gates against El Zagal, and\r\nthat no reinforcements were to be expected, completed the despair of\r\nthe inhabitants; even Reduan himself lost confidence and advised\r\ncapitulation.\r\n\r\nFerdinand granted favorable conditions, for he was eager to proceed\r\nagainst Malaga. The inhabitants were permitted to depart with their\r\neffects except their arms, and to reside, if they chose it, in Spain\r\nin any place distant from the sea. One hundred and twenty Christians of\r\nboth sexes were rescued from captivity by the surrender, and were sent\r\nto Cordova, where they were received with great tenderness by the queen\r\nand her daughter the infanta Isabella in the famous cathedral in the\r\nmidst of public rejoicings for the victory.\r\n\r\nThe capture of Velez Malaga was followed by the surrender of Bentomiz,\r\nComares, and all the towns and fortresses of the Axarquia, which were\r\nstrongly garrisoned, and discreet and valiant cavaliers appointed as\r\ntheir alcaydes. The inhabitants of nearly forty towns of the Alpuxarras\r\nmountains also sent deputations to the Castilian sovereigns, taking the\r\noath of allegiance as mudexares or Moslem vassals.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time came letters from Boabdil el Chico announcing to the\r\nsovereigns the revolution of Granada in his favor. He solicited kindness\r\nand protection for the inhabitants who had returned to their allegiance,\r\nand for those of all other places which should renounce adherence to his\r\nuncle. By this means (he observed) the whole kingdom of Granada would\r\nsoon be induced to acknowledge his sway, and would be held by him in\r\nfaithful vassalage to the Castilian Crown.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic sovereigns complied with his request. Protection was\r\nimmediately extended to the inhabitants of Granada, permitting them\r\nto cultivate their fields in peace and to trade with the Christian\r\nterritories in all articles excepting arms, being provided with letters\r\nof surety from some Christian captain or alcayde. The same favor was\r\npromised to all other places which within six months should renounce El\r\nZagal and come under allegiance to the younger king. Should they not do\r\nso within that time, the sovereigns threatened to make war upon them and\r\nconquer them for themselves. This measure had a great effect in inducing\r\nmany to return to the standard of Boabdil.\r\n\r\nHaving made every necessary arrangement for the government and security\r\nof the newly-conquered territory, Ferdinand turned his attention to the\r\ngreat object of his campaign, the reduction of Malaga.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\n\r\nOF THE CITY OF MALAGA AND ITS INHABITANTS.--MISSION OF HERNANDO DEL\r\nPULGAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe city of Malaga lies in the lap of a fertile valley, surrounded by\r\nmountains, excepting on the part which lies open to the sea. As it was\r\none of the most important, so it was one of the strongest, cities of\r\nthe Moorish kingdom. It was fortified by walls of prodigious strength\r\nstudded with a great number of huge towers. On the land side it was\r\nprotected by a natural barrier of mountains, and on the other the\r\nwaves of the Mediterranean beat against the foundations of its massive\r\nbulwarks.\r\n\r\nAt one end of the city, near the sea, on a high mound, stood the\r\nAlcazaba, or citadel, a fortress of great strength. Immediately above\r\nthis rose a steep and rocky mount, on the top of which in old times had\r\nbeen a pharos or lighthouse, from which the height derived its name of\r\nGibralfaro.* It was at present crowned by an immense castle, which, from\r\nits lofty and cragged situation, its vast walls, and mighty towers, was\r\ndeemed impregnable. It communicated with the Alcazaba by a covered way\r\nsix paces broad, leading down between two walls along the profile or\r\nridge of the rock. The castle of Gibralfaro commanded both citadel and\r\ncity, and was capable, if both were taken, of maintaining a siege. Two\r\nlarge suburbs adjoined the city: in the one toward the sea were the\r\ndwelling-houses of the most opulent inhabitants, adorned with hanging\r\ngardens; the other, on the land side, was thickly peopled and surrounded\r\nby strong walls and towers.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * A corruption of “Gibel-faro,” the hill of the lighthouse.\r\n\r\n\r\nMalaga possessed a brave and numerous garrison, and the common people\r\nwere active, hardy, and resolute; but the city was rich and commercial,\r\nand under the habitual control of numerous opulent merchants, who\r\ndreaded the ruinous consequences of a siege. They were little zealous\r\nfor the warlike renown of their city, and longed rather to participate\r\nin the enviable security of property and the lucrative privileges of\r\nsafe traffic with the Christian territories granted to all places which\r\ndeclared for Boabdil. At the head of these gainful citizens was Ali\r\nDordux, a mighty merchant of uncounted wealth, connected, it is said,\r\nwith the royal family of Granada, whose ships traded to every part of\r\nthe Levant and whose word was as a law in Malaga. Ali Dordux assembled\r\nthe most opulent and important of his commercial brethren, and they\r\nrepaired in a body to the Alcazaba, where they were received by the\r\nalcayde, Aben Comixa, with that deference generally shown to men of\r\ntheir great local dignity and power of purse. Ali Dordux was ample\r\nand stately in his form and fluent and emphatic in his discourse; his\r\neloquence had an effect, therefore, upon the alcayde as he represented\r\nthe hopelessness of a defence of Malaga, the misery that must attend a\r\nsiege, and the ruin that must follow a capture by force of arms. On\r\nthe other hand, he set forth the grace that might be obtained from the\r\nCastilian sovereigns by an early and voluntary acknowledgment of Boabdil\r\nas king, the peaceful possession of their property, and the profitable\r\ncommerce with the Christian ports that would be allowed them. He was\r\nseconded by his weighty and important coadjutors; and the alcadye,\r\naccustomed to regard them as the arbiters of the affairs of the place,\r\nyielded to their united counsels. He departed, therefore, with all speed\r\nto the Christian camp, empowered to arrange a capitulation with the\r\nCastilian monarch, and in the mean time his brother remained in command\r\nof the Alcazaba.\r\n\r\nThere was at this time as alcayde in the old crag-built castle of\r\nGibralfaro a warlike and fiery Moor, an implacable enemy of the\r\nChristians. This was no other than Hamet Zeli, surnamed El Zegri, the\r\nonce-formidable alcayde of Ronda and the terror of its mountains. He\r\nhad never forgiven the capture of his favorite fortress, and panted\r\nfor vengeance on the Christians. Notwithstanding his reverses, he\r\nhad retained the favor of El Zagal, who knew how to appreciate a bold\r\nwarrior of the kind, and had placed him in command of this important\r\nfortress of Gibralfaro.\r\n\r\nHamet el Zegri had gathered round him the remnant of his band of\r\nGomeres, with others of the same tribe recently arrived from Morocco.\r\nThese fierce warriors were nestled like so many war-hawks about their\r\nlofty cliff. They looked down with martial contempt upon the commercial\r\ncity of Malaga, which they were placed to protect; or, rather, they\r\nesteemed it only for its military importance and its capability of\r\ndefence. They held no communion with its trading, gainful inhabitants,\r\nand even considered the garrison of the Alcazaba as their inferiors.\r\nWar was their pursuit and passion; they rejoiced in its turbulent and\r\nperilous scenes; and, confident in the strength of the city, and, above\r\nall, of their castle, they set at defiance the menace of Christian\r\ninvasion. There were among them also many apostate Moors, who had\r\nonce embraced Christianity, but had since recanted and fled from the\r\nvengeance of the Inquisition.* These were desperadoes who had no mercy\r\nto expect should they again fall into the hands of the enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Zurita, lib. 30, cap. 71.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch were the fierce elements of the garrison of Gibralfaro, and its\r\nrage may easily be conceived at hearing that Malaga was to be given up\r\nwithout a blow; that they were to sink into Christian vassals under\r\nthe intermediate sway of Boabdil el Chico; and that the alcayde of the\r\nAlcazaba had departed to arrange the terms of capitulation.\r\n\r\nHamet determined to avert by desperate means the threatened degradation.\r\nHe knew that there was a large party in the city faithful to El Zagal,\r\nbeing composed of warlike men who had taken refuge from the various\r\nmountain-towns which had been captured; their feelings were desperate\r\nas their fortunes, and, like Hamet, they panted for revenge upon\r\nthe Christians. With these he had a secret conference, and received\r\nassurances of their adherence to him in any measures of defence. As to\r\nthe counsel of the peaceful inhabitants, he considered it unworthy the\r\nconsideration of a soldier, and he spurned at the interference of the\r\nwealthy merchant Ali Dordux in matters of warfare.\r\n\r\n“Still,” said Hamet el Zegri, “let us proceed regularly.” So he\r\ndescended with his Gomeres to the citadel, entered it suddenly, put to\r\ndeath the brother of the alcayde and such of the garrison as made\r\nany demur, and then summoned the principal inhabitants of Malaga\r\nto deliberate on measures for the welfare of the city.* The wealthy\r\nmerchants again mounted to the citadel, excepting Ali Dordux, who\r\nrefused to obey the summons. They entered with hearts filled with awe,\r\nfor they found Hamet surrounded by his grim African guard and all the\r\nstern array of military power, and they beheld the bloody traces of the\r\nrecent massacre.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Cura de los Palacios, c. 82.\r\n\r\n\r\nHamet rolled a dark and searching eye upon the assembly. “Who,” said\r\nhe, “is loyal and devoted to Muley Abdallah el Zagal?” Every one present\r\nasserted his loyalty. “Good!” said Hamet; “and who is ready to prove his\r\ndevotion to his sovereign by defending this his important city to the\r\nlast extremity?” Every one present declared his readiness. “Enough!”\r\n observed Hamet. “The alcayde Aben Comixa has proved himself a traitor to\r\nhis sovereign and to you all, for he has conspired to deliver the\r\nplace to the Christians. It behooves you to choose some other commander\r\ncapable of defending your city against the approaching enemy.” The\r\nassembly declared unanimously that no one was so worthy of the command\r\nas himself. So Hamet was appointed alcayde of Malaga, and immediately\r\nproceeded to man the forts and towers with his partisans and to make\r\nevery preparation for a desperate resistance.\r\n\r\nIntelligence of these occurrences put an end to the negotiations between\r\nKing Ferdinand and the superseded alcayde Aben Comixa, and it was\r\nsupposed there was no alternative but to lay siege to the place. The\r\nmarques of Cadiz, however, found at Velez a Moorish cavalier of some\r\nnote, a native of Malaga, who offered to tamper with Hamet el Zegri for\r\nthe surrender of the city, or at least of the castle of Gibralfaro. The\r\nmarques communicated this to the king. “I put this business and the key\r\nof my treasury into your hands,” said Ferdinand; “act, stipulate, and\r\ndisburse in my name as you think proper.”\r\n\r\nThe marques armed the Moor with his own lance, cuirass, and target and\r\nmounted him on one of his own horses. He equipped in similar style also\r\nanother Moor, his companion and relative. They bore secret letters\r\nto Hamet from the marques offering him the town of Coin in perpetual\r\ninheritance and four thousand doblas in gold if he would deliver\r\nup Gibralfaro, together with a farm and two thousand doblas for his\r\nlieutenant, Ibrahim Zenete, and large sums to be distributed among\r\nhis officers and soldiers; and he offered unlimited rewards for the\r\nsurrender of the city.\r\n\r\nHamet had a warrior’s admiration of the marques of Cadiz, and received\r\nhis messengers with courtesy in his fortress of Gibralfaro. He even\r\nlistened to their propositions with patience, and dismissed them in\r\nsafety, though with an absolute refusal. The marques thought his reply\r\nwas not so peremptory as to discourage another effort. The emissaries\r\nwere despatched, therefore, a second time, with further propositions.\r\nThey approached Malaga in the night, but found the guards doubled,\r\npatrols abroad, and the whole place on the alert. They were discovered,\r\npursued, and only saved themselves by the fleetness of their steeds and\r\ntheir knowledge of the passes of the mountains.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Cura de los Palacios, MS., c. 82.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinding all attempts to tamper with the faith of Hamet utterly futile,\r\nKing Ferdinand publicly summoned the city to surrender, offering the\r\nmost favorable terms in case of immediate compliance, but threatening\r\ncaptivity to all the inhabitants in case of resistance.\r\n\r\nIt required a man of nerve to undertake the delivery of such a summons\r\nin the present heated and turbulent state of the Moorish community. Such\r\na one stepped forward in the person of a cavalier of the royal guards,\r\nHernan Perez del Pulgar by name, a youth of noble descent, who had\r\nalready signalized himself by his romantic valor and daring enterprise.\r\nFurnished with official papers for Hamet el Zegri and a private letter\r\nfrom the king to Ali Dordux, he entered the gates of Malaga under the\r\nprotection of a flag, and boldly delivered his summons in presence of\r\nthe principal inhabitants. The language of the summons or the tone in\r\nwhich it was delivered exasperated the fiery spirit of the Moors, and\r\nit required all the energy of Hamet and the influence of several of\r\nthe alfaquis to prevent an outrage to the person of the ambassador. The\r\nreply of Hamet was haughty and decided. “The city of Malaga has been\r\nconfided to me,” said he--“not to be surrendered, but defended, and the\r\nking shall witness how I acquit myself of my charge.” *\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Pulgar, part 3, cap. 74.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis mission at an end, Hernan del Pulgar rode slowly and deliberately\r\nthrough the city, utterly regardless of the scowls and menaces and\r\nscarcely restrained turbulence of the multitude, and bore to Ferdinand\r\nat Velez the haughty answer of the Moor, but at the same time gave him\r\na formidable account of the force of the garrison, the strength of the\r\nfortifications, and the determined spirit of the commander and his men.\r\nThe king immediately sent orders to have the heavy artillery forwarded\r\nfrom Antiquera, and on the 7th of May marched with his army toward\r\nMalaga.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\n\r\nADVANCE OF KING FERDINAND AGAINST MALAGA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe army of Ferdinand advanced in lengthened line, glittering along the\r\nfoot of the mountains which border the Mediterranean, while a fleet of\r\nvessels, freighted with heavy artillery and warlike munitions, kept\r\npace with it at a short distance from the land, covering the sea with a\r\nthousand gleaming sails. When Hamet el Zegri saw this force approaching,\r\nhe set fire to the houses of the suburbs which adjoined the walls and\r\nsent forth three battalions to encounter the advance guard of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe Christian army drew near to the city at that end where the castle\r\nand rocky height of Gibralfaro defended the seaboard. Immediately\r\nopposite, at about two bow-shots’ distance, stood the castle, and\r\nbetween it and the high chain of mountains was a steep and rocky hill,\r\nat present called the hill of St. Christobal, commanding a pass through\r\nwhich the Christians must march to penetrate to the vega and surround\r\nthe city. Hamet ordered the three battalions to take their stations--one\r\non this hill, another in the pass near the castle, and a third on the\r\nside of the mountain near the sea.\r\n\r\nA body of Spanish foot-soldiers of the advance guard, sturdy\r\nmountaineers of Galicia, sprang forward to climb the side of the height\r\nnext the sea, at the same time a number of cavaliers and hidalgos of the\r\nroyal household attacked the Moors who guarded the pass below. The Moors\r\ndefended their posts with obstinate valor. The Galicians were repeatedly\r\noverpowered and driven down the hill, but as often rallied, and, being\r\nreinforced by the hidalgos and cavaliers, returned to the assault. This\r\nobstinate struggle lasted for six hours: the strife was of a deadly\r\nkind, not merely with crossbows and arquebuses, but hand to hand with\r\nswords and daggers; no quarter was claimed or given on either side--they\r\nfought not to make captives, but to slay. It was but the advance of the\r\nChristian army that was engaged; so narrow was the pass along the coast\r\nthat the army could proceed only in file: horse and foot and beasts of\r\nburden were crowded one upon another, impeding each other and blocking\r\nup the narrow and rugged defile. The soldiers heard the uproar of the\r\nbattle, the sound of trumpets, and the war-cries of the Moors, but tried\r\nin vain to press forward to the assistance of their companions.\r\n\r\nAt length a body of foot-soldiers of the Holy Brotherhood climbed with\r\ngreat difficulty the steep side of the mountain which overhung the pass,\r\nand advanced with seven banners displayed. The Moors, seeing this force\r\nabove them, abandoned the pass in despair. The battle was still raging\r\non the height; the Galicians, though supported by Castilian troops under\r\nDon Hurtado de Mendoza and Garcilasso de la Vega, were severely pressed\r\nand roughly handled by the Moors: at length a brave standard-bearer,\r\nLuys Mazeda by name, threw himself into the midst of the enemy and\r\nplanted his banner on the summit. The Galicians and Castilians,\r\nstimulated by this noble self-devotion, followed him, fighting\r\ndesperately, and the Moors were at length driven to their castle of\r\nGibralfaro.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Pulgar, Cronica.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis important height being taken, the pass lay open to the army, but\r\nby this time evening was advancing, and the host was too weary and\r\nexhausted to seek proper situations for the encampment. The king,\r\nattended by several grandees and cavaliers, went the rounds at night,\r\nstationing outposts toward the city and guards and patrols to give the\r\nalarm on the least movement of the enemy. All night the Christians lay\r\nupon their arms, lest there should be some attempt to sally forth and\r\nattack them.\r\n\r\nWhen the morning dawned the king gazed with admiration at this city\r\nwhich he hoped soon to add to his dominions. It was surrounded on one\r\nside by vineyards, gardens, and orchards, which covered the hills with\r\nverdure; on the other side its walls were bathed by the smooth and\r\ntranquil sea. Its vast and lofty towers and prodigious castles, hoary\r\nwith age, yet unimpaired in strength, showed the labors of magnanimous\r\nmen in former times to protect their favorite abode. Hanging gardens,\r\ngroves of oranges, citrons, and pomegranates, with tall cedars and\r\nstately palms, were mingled with the stern battlements and towers,\r\nbespeaking the opulence and luxury that reigned within.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the Christian army poured through the pass, and,\r\nthrowing out its columns and extending its lines, took possession of\r\nevery vantage-ground around the city. King Ferdinand surveyed the ground\r\nand appointed the stations of the different commanders.\r\n\r\nThe important mount of St. Christobal, which had cost so violent a\r\nstruggle and faced the powerful fortress of Gibralfaro, was given in\r\ncharge to Roderigo Ponce de Leon, marques of Cadiz, who in all sieges\r\nclaimed the post of danger. He had several noble cavaliers with their\r\nretainers in his encampment, which consisted of fifteen hundred horse\r\nand fourteen thousand foot, and extended from the summit of the mount to\r\nthe margin of the sea, completely blocking up the approach to the city\r\non that side. From this post a line of encampments extended quite round\r\nthe city to the seaboard, fortified by bulwarks and deep ditches, while\r\na fleet of armed ships and galleys stretched before the harbor, so that\r\nthe place was completely invested by sea and land. The various parts\r\nof the valley now resounded with the din of preparation, and was filled\r\nwith artificers preparing warlike engines and munitions; armorers\r\nand smiths with glowing forges and deafening hammers; carpenters\r\nand engineers constructing machines wherewith to assail the walls;\r\nstone-cutters shaping stone balls for the ordnance; and burners of\r\ncharcoal preparing fuel for the furnaces and forges.\r\n\r\nWhen the encampment was formed the heavy ordnance was landed from the\r\nships and mounted in various parts of the camp. Five huge lombards were\r\nplaced on the mount commanded by the marques of Cadiz, so as to bear\r\nupon the castle of Gibralfaro.\r\n\r\nThe Moors made strenuous efforts to impede these preparations. They kept\r\nup a heavy fire from their ordnance upon the men employed in digging\r\ntrenches or constructing batteries, so that the latter had to\r\nwork principally in the night. The royal tents had been stationed\r\nconspicuously and within reach of the Moorish batteries, but were so\r\nwarmly assailed that they had to be removed behind a hill.\r\n\r\nWhen the works were completed the Christian batteries opened in return,\r\nand kept up a tremendous cannonade, while the fleet, approaching the\r\nland, assailed the city vigorously on the opposite side.\r\n\r\n“It was a glorious and delectable sight,” observes Fray Antonio Agapida,\r\n“to behold this infidel city thus surrounded by sea and land by a mighty\r\nChristian force. Every mound in its circuit was, as it were, a little\r\ncity of tents bearing the standard of some renowned Catholic warrior.\r\nBesides the warlike ships and galleys which lay before the place, the\r\nsea was covered with innumerable sails, passing and repassing, appearing\r\nand disappearing, being engaged in bringing supplies for the subsistence\r\nof the army. It seemed a vast spectacle contrived to recreate the eye,\r\ndid not the volleying bursts of flame and smoke from the ships, which\r\nseemed to lie asleep on the quiet sea, and the thunder of ordnance from\r\ncamp and city, from tower and battlement, tell the deadly warfare that\r\nwas waging.\r\n\r\n“At night the scene was far more direful than in the day. The cheerful\r\nlight of the sun was gone; there was nothing but the flashes of\r\nartillery or the baleful gleams of combustibles thrown into the city,\r\nand the conflagration of the houses. The fire kept up from the Christian\r\nbatteries was incessant: there were seven great lombards in particular,\r\ncalled the Seven Sisters of Ximenes, which did tremendous execution.\r\nThe Moorish ordnance replied in thunder from the walls; Gibralfaro was\r\nwrapped in volumes of smoke rolling about its base; and Hamet and his\r\nGomeres looked out with triumph upon the tempest of war they had awaked.\r\nTruly they were so many demons incarnate,” concludes the pious Fray\r\nAntonio Agapida, “who were permitted by Heaven to enter into and possess\r\nthis infidel city for its perdition.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV.\r\n\r\nSIEGE OF MALAGA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe attack on Malaga by sea and land was kept up for several days with\r\ntremendous violence, but without producing any great impression, so\r\nstrong were the ancient bulwarks of the city. The count de Cifuentes was\r\nthe first to signalize himself by any noted achievement. A main tower,\r\nprotecting what is at present called the suburb of Santa Ana, had been\r\nshattered by the ordnance and the battlements demolished, so as to yield\r\nno shelter to its defenders. Seeing this, the count assembled a gallant\r\nband of cavaliers of the royal household and advanced to take it by\r\nstorm. They applied scaling-ladders and mounted sword in hand. The\r\nMoors, having no longer battlements to protect them, descended to a\r\nlower floor, and made furious resistance from the windows and loopholes.\r\nThey poured down boiling pitch and rosin, and hurled stones and darts\r\nand arrows on the assailants. Many of the Christians were slain, their\r\nladders were destroyed by flaming combustibles, and the count was\r\nobliged to retreat from before the tower. On the following day he\r\nrenewed the attack with superior force, and after a severe combat\r\nsucceeded in planting his victorious banner on the tower.\r\n\r\nThe Moors now assailed the tower in their turn. They undermined the part\r\ntoward the city, placed props of wood under the foundation, and, setting\r\nfire to them, drew off to a distance. In a little while the props gave\r\nway, the foundation sunk, and the tower was rent; part of its wall\r\nfell with a tremendous noise; many of the Christians were thrown out\r\nheadlong, and the rest were laid open to the missiles of the enemy.\r\n\r\nBy this time, however, a breach had been made in the wall of the suburb\r\nadjoining the tower, and troops poured in to the assistance of their\r\ncomrades. A continued battle was kept up for two days and a night by\r\nreinforcements from camp and city. The parties fought backward and\r\nforward through the breach of the wall and in the narrow and winding\r\nstreets adjacent with alternate success, and the vicinity of the tower\r\nwas strewn with the dead and wounded. At length the Moors gradually gave\r\nway, disputing every inch of ground, until they were driven into the\r\ncity, and the Christians remained masters of the greater part of the\r\nsuburb.\r\n\r\nThis partial success, though gained with great toil and bloodshed, gave\r\ntemporary animation to the Christians; they soon found, however, that\r\nthe attack on the main works of the city was a much more arduous task.\r\nThe garrison contained veterans who had served in many of the towns\r\ncaptured by the Christians. They were no longer confounded and\r\ndismayed by the battering ordnance and other strange engines of foreign\r\ninvention, and had become expert in parrying their effects, in repairing\r\nbreaches, and erecting counter-works.\r\n\r\nThe Christians, accustomed of late to speedy conquests of Moorish\r\nfortresses, became impatient of the slow progress of the siege. Many\r\nwere apprehensive of a scarcity of provisions from the difficulty of\r\nsubsisting so numerous a host in the heart of the enemy’s country,\r\nwhere it was necessary to transport supplies across rugged and hostile\r\nmountains or subjected to the uncertainties of the sea. Many also were\r\nalarmed at a pestilence which broke out in the neighboring villages, and\r\nsome were so overcome by these apprehensions as to abandon the camp and\r\nreturn to their homes.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the loose and worthless hangers-on that infest all great\r\narmies, hearing these murmurs, thought that the siege would soon be\r\nraised, and deserted to the enemy, hoping to make their fortunes. They\r\ngave exaggerated accounts of the alarms and discontents of the army, and\r\nrepresented the troops as daily returning home in bands. Above all, they\r\ndeclared that the gunpowder was nearly exhausted, so that the artillery\r\nwould soon be useless. They assured the Moors, therefore, that if they\r\npersisted a little longer in their defence, the king would be obliged to\r\ndraw off his forces and abandon the siege.\r\n\r\nThe reports of these renegados gave fresh courage to the garrison; they\r\nmade vigorous sallies upon the camp, harassing it by night and day, and\r\nobliging every part to be guarded with the most painful vigilance. They\r\nfortified the weak parts of their walls with ditches and palisadoes, and\r\ngave every manifestation of a determined and unyielding spirit.\r\n\r\nFerdinand soon received intelligence of the reports which had been\r\ncarried to the Moors: he understood that they had been informed,\r\nlikewise, that the queen was alarmed for the safety of the camp, and had\r\nwritten repeatedly urging him to abandon the siege. As the best means\r\nof disproving all these falsehoods and destroying the vain hopes of\r\nthe enemy, he wrote to the queen entreating her to come and take up her\r\nresidence in the camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV.\r\n\r\nSIEGE OF MALAGA CONTINUED.--OBSTINACY OF HAMET EL ZEGRI.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat was the enthusiasm of the army when they beheld their patriot\r\nqueen advancing in state to share the toils and dangers of her people.\r\nIsabella entered the camp attended by the dignitaries and the whole\r\nretinue of her court to manifest that this was no temporary visit. On\r\none side of her was her daughter, the infanta; on the other, the grand\r\ncardinal of Spain: Hernando de Talavera, the prior of Prado, confessor\r\nto the queen, followed, with a great train of prelates, courtiers,\r\ncavaliers, and ladies of distinction. The cavalcade moved in calm and\r\nstately order through the camp, softening the iron aspect of war by this\r\narray of courtly grace and female beauty.\r\n\r\nIsabella had commanded that on her coming to the camp the horrors of war\r\nshould be suspended and fresh offers of peace made to the enemy. On\r\nher arrival, therefore, there had been a general cessation of firing\r\nthroughout the camp. A messenger was at the same time despatched to\r\nthe besieged, informing them of her being in the camp, and of the\r\ndetermination of the sovereigns to make it their settled residence\r\nuntil the city should be taken. The same terms were offered in case\r\nof immediate surrender that had been granted to Velez Malaga, but the\r\ninhabitants were threatened with captivity and the sword should they\r\npersist in their defence.\r\n\r\nHamet el Zegri received this message with haughty contempt, and\r\ndismissed the messenger without deigning a reply, and accompanied by an\r\nescort to prevent his holding any communication with the inhabitants in\r\nthe streets. “The Christian sovereigns,” said Hamet to those about him,\r\n“have made this offer in consequence of their despair. The silence of\r\ntheir batteries proves the truth of what has been told us, that their\r\npowder is exhausted. They have no longer the means of demolishing our\r\nwalls, and if they remain much longer the autumnal rains will interrupt\r\ntheir convoys and fill their camp with famine and disease. The first\r\nstorm will disperse their fleet, which has no neighboring port of\r\nshelter: Africa will then be open to us to procure reinforcements and\r\nsupplies.”\r\n\r\nThe words of Hamet el Zegri were hailed as oracular by his adherents.\r\nMany of the peaceful part of the community, however, ventured to\r\nremonstrate, and to implore him to accept the proffered mercy. The stern\r\nHamet silenced them with a terrific threat: he declared that whoever\r\nshould talk of capitulating or should hold any communication with the\r\nChristians should be put to death. The Gomeres, like true men of the\r\nsword, acted upon the menace of their chieftain as upon a written law,\r\nand, having detected several of the inhabitants in secret correspondence\r\nwith the enemy, set upon and slew them and confiscated their effects.\r\nThis struck such terror into the citizens that those who had been\r\nloudest in their murmurs became suddenly mute, and were remarked as\r\nevincing the greatest bustle and alacrity in the defence of the city.\r\n\r\nWhen the messenger returned to the camp and reported the contemptuous\r\nreception of the royal message, King Ferdinand was exceedingly\r\nindignant. Finding the cessation of firing on the queen’s arrival had\r\nencouraged a belief among the enemy that there was a scarcity of powder\r\nin the camp, he ordered a general discharge from all the batteries. The\r\nsudden burst of war from every quarter soon convinced the Moors of their\r\nerror and completed the confusion of the citizens, who knew not which\r\nmost to dread, their assailants or their defenders, the Christians or\r\nthe Gomeres.\r\n\r\nThat evening the sovereigns visited the encampment of the marques of\r\nCadiz, which commanded a view over a great part of the city, the camp,\r\nand the sea with its flotillas. The tent of the marques was of great\r\nmagnitude, furnished with hangings of rich brocade and French cloth of\r\nthe rarest texture. It was in the Oriental style, and, as it crowned the\r\nheight, with the surrounding tents of other cavaliers, all sumptuously\r\nfurnished, presented a gay and silken contrast to the opposite towers of\r\nGibralfaro. Here a splendid collation was served up to the sovereigns,\r\nand the courtly revel that prevailed in this chivalrous encampment, the\r\nglitter of pageantry, and the bursts of festive music made more striking\r\nthe gloom and silence that reigned over the Moorish castle.\r\n\r\nThe marques of Cadiz while it was yet light conducted his royal visitors\r\nto every point that commanded a view of the warlike scene below. He\r\ncaused the heavy lombards also to be discharged, that the queen and\r\nladies of the court might witness the effect of those tremendous\r\nengines. The fair dames were filled with awe and admiration as the\r\nmountain shook beneath their feet with the thunder of the artillery and\r\nthey beheld great fragments of the Moorish walls tumbling down the rocks\r\nand precipices.\r\n\r\nWhile the good marques was displaying these things to his royal guests\r\nhe lifted up his eyes, and to his astonishment beheld his own banner\r\nhanging out from the nearest tower of Gibralfaro. The blood mantled\r\nin his cheek, for it was a banner which he had lost at the time of the\r\nmemorable massacre of the heights of Malaga.* To make this taunt\r\nmore evident, several of the Gomeres displayed themselves upon the\r\nbattlements arrayed in the helmets and cuirasses of some of the\r\ncavaliers slain or captured on that occasion. The marques of Cadiz\r\nrestrained his indignation and held his peace, but several of, his\r\ncavaliers vowed loudly to revenge this cruel bravado on the ferocious\r\ngarrison of Gibralfaro.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Diego de Valera, Cronica, MS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI.\r\n\r\nATTACK OF THE MARQUES OF CADIZ UPON GIBRALFARO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe marques of Cadiz was not a cavalier that readily forgave an injury\r\nor an insult. On the morning after the royal banquet his batteries\r\nopened a tremendous fire upon Gibralfaro. All day the encampment was\r\nwrapped in wreaths of smoke, nor did the assault cease with the day, but\r\nthroughout the night there was an incessant flashing and thundering of\r\nthe lombards, and the following morning the assault rather increased\r\nthan slackened in fury. The Moorish bulwarks were no proof against those\r\nformidable engines. In a few days the lofty tower on which the taunting\r\nbanner had been displayed was shattered, a smaller tower in its vicinity\r\nreduced to ruins, and a great breach made in the intervening walls.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the hot-spirited cavaliers were eager for storming the breach\r\nsword in hand; others, more cool and wary, pointed out the rashness of\r\nsuch an attempt, for the Moors had worked indefatigably in the night;\r\nthey had digged a deep ditch within the breach, and had fortified it\r\nwith palisadoes and a high breastwork. All, however, agreed that the\r\ncamp might safely be advanced near to the ruined walls, and that it\r\nought to be done in return for the insolent defiance of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe marques of Cadiz felt the temerity of the measure, but was unwilling\r\nto dampen the zeal of these high-spirited cavaliers, and, having chosen\r\nthe post of danger in the camp, it did not become him to decline\r\nany service merely because it might appear perilous. He ordered his\r\noutposts, therefore, to be advanced within a stone’s-throw of the\r\nbreach, but exhorted the soldiers to maintain the utmost vigilance.\r\n\r\nThe thunder of the batteries had ceased; the troops, exhausted by two\r\nnights’ fatigue and watchfulness, and apprehending no danger from the\r\ndismantled walls, were half of them asleep; the rest were scattered\r\nabout in negligent security. On a sudden upward of two thousand Moors\r\nsallied forth from the castle, led on by Ibrahim Zenete, the principal\r\ncaptain under Hamet. They fell with fearful havoc upon the advanced\r\nguard, slaying many of them in their sleep and putting the rest to\r\nheadlong flight.\r\n\r\nThe marques was in his tent, about a bow-shot distant, when he heard\r\nthe tumult of the onset and beheld his men dying in confusion. He\r\nrushed forth, followed by his standard-bearer. “Turn again, cavaliers!”\r\n exclaimed he; “I am here, Ponce de Leon! To the foe! to the foe!” The\r\nflying troops stopped at hearing his well-known voice, rallied under\r\nhis banner, and turned upon the enemy. The encampment by this time was\r\nroused; several cavaliers from the adjoining stations had hastened to\r\nthe scene of action, with a number of Galicians and soldiers of the Holy\r\nBrotherhood. An obstinate and bloody contest ensued; the ruggedness of\r\nthe place, the rocks, chasms, and declivities broke it into numerous\r\ncombats: Christian and Moor fought hand to hand with swords and\r\ndaggers, and often, grappling and struggling, rolled together down the\r\nprecipices.\r\n\r\nThe banner of the marques was in danger of being taken: he hastened\r\nto its rescue, followed by some of his bravest cavaliers. They were\r\nsurrounded by the enemy, and several of them cut down. Don Diego Ponce\r\nde Leon, brother to the marques, was wounded by an arrow, and his\r\nson-in-law, Luis Ponce, was likewise wounded: they succeeded, however,\r\nin rescuing the banner and bearing it off in safety. The battle lasted\r\nfor an hour; the height was covered with killed and wounded and the\r\nblood flowed in streams down the rocks; at length, Ibrahim Zenete being\r\ndisabled by the thrust of a lance, the Moors gave way and retreated to\r\nthe castle.\r\n\r\nThey now opened a galling fire from their battlements and towers,\r\napproaching the breaches so as to discharge their crossbows and\r\narquebuses into the advanced guard of the encampment. The marques was\r\nsingled out: the shot fell thick about him, and one passed through his\r\nbuckler and struck upon his cuirass, but without doing him any injury.\r\nEvery one now saw the danger and inutility of approaching the camp thus\r\nnear to the castle, and those who had counselled it were now urgent that\r\nit should be withdrawn. It was accordingly removed back to its original\r\nground, from which the marques had most reluctantly advanced it. Nothing\r\nbut his valor and timely aid had prevented this attack on his outpost\r\nfrom ending in a total rout of all that part of the army.\r\n\r\nMany cavaliers of distinction fell in this contest, but the loss of\r\nnone was felt more deeply than that of Ortega del Prado, captain of\r\nescaladors. He was one of the bravest men in the service, the same\r\nwho had devised the first successful blow of the war, the storming of\r\nAlhama, where he was the first to plant and mount the scaling-ladders.\r\nHe had always been high in the favor and confidence of the noble Ponce\r\nde Leon, who knew how to appreciate and avail himself of the merits of\r\nall able and valiant men.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Zurita, Mariana, Abarca.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII.\r\n\r\nSIEGE OF MALAGIA CONTINUED.--STRATAGEMS OF VARIOUS KINDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat were the exertions now made, both by the besiegers and the\r\nbesieged, to carry on the contest with the utmost vigor. Hamet went\r\nthe rounds of the walls and towers, doubling the guards and putting\r\neverything in the best posture of defence. The garrison was divided into\r\nparties of a hundred, to each of which a captain was appointed. Some\r\nwere to patrol, others to sally forth and skirmish with the enemy,\r\nand others to hold themselves armed and in reserve. Six albatozas, or\r\nfloating batteries, were manned and armed with pieces of artillery to\r\nattack the fleet.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Castilian sovereigns kept open a communication by\r\nsea with various parts of Spain, from which they received provisions\r\nof all kinds; they ordered supplies of powder also from Valencia,\r\nBarcelona, Sicily, and Portugal. They made great preparations also for\r\nstorming the city. Towers of wood were constructed to move on wheels,\r\neach capable of holding one hundred men; they were furnished with\r\nladders to be thrown from their summits to the tops of the walls, and\r\nwithin those ladders others were encased, to be let down for the descent\r\nof the troops into the city. There were gallipagos, or tortoises,\r\nalso being great wooden shields, covered with hides, to protect the\r\nassailants and those who undermined the walls.\r\n\r\nSecret mines were commenced in various places: some were intended to\r\nreach to the foundations of the walls, which were to be propped up with\r\nwood, ready to be set on fire; others were to pass under the walls, and\r\nremain ready to be broken open so as to give entrance to the besiegers.\r\nAt these mines the army worked day and night, and during these secret\r\npreparations the ordnance kept up a fire upon the city to divert the\r\nattention of the besieged.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, Hamet displayed wonderful vigor and ingenuity in\r\ndefending the city and in repairing or fortifying by deep ditches the\r\nbreaches made by the enemy. He noted also every place where the camp\r\nmight be assailed with advantage, and gave the besieging army no\r\nrepose night or day. While his troops sallied on the land, his floating\r\nbatteries attacked the besiegers on the sea, so that there was incessant\r\nskirmishing. The tents called the Queen’s Hospital were crowded with\r\nwounded, and the whole army suffered from constant watchfulness and\r\nfatigue. To guard against the sudden assaults of the Moors, the trenches\r\nwere deepened and palisadoes erected in front of the camp; and in that\r\npart facing Gibralfaro, where the rocky heights did not admit of\r\nsuch defences, a high rampart of earth was thrown up. The cavaliers\r\nGarcilasso de la Vega, Juan de Zuniga, and Diego de Atayde were\r\nappointed to go the rounds and keep vigilant watch that these\r\nfortifications were maintained in good order.\r\n\r\nIn a little while Hamet discovered the mines secretly commenced by the\r\nChristians: he immediately ordered counter-mines. The soldiers mutually\r\nworked until they met and fought hand to hand in these subterranean\r\npassages. The Christians were driven out of one of their mines; fire was\r\nset to the wooden framework and the mine destroyed. Encouraged by this\r\nsuccess, the Moors attempted a general attack upon the camp, the mines,\r\nand the besieging fleet. The battle lasted for six hours on land and\r\nwater, above and below ground, on bulwark, and in trench and mine; the\r\nMoors displayed wonderful intrepidity, but were finally repulsed at all\r\npoints, and obliged to retire into the city, where they were closely\r\ninvested, without the means of receiving any assistance from abroad.\r\n\r\nThe horrors of famine were now added to the other miseries of Malaga.\r\nHamet, with the spirit of a man bred up to war, considered everything\r\nas subservient to the wants of the soldier, and ordered all the grain\r\nin the city to be gathered and garnered up for the sole use of those\r\nwho fought. Even this was dealt out sparingly, and each soldier received\r\nfour ounces of bread in the morning and two in the evening for his daily\r\nallowance.\r\n\r\nThe wealthy inhabitants and all those peacefully inclined mourned over a\r\nresistance which brought destruction upon their houses, death into\r\ntheir families, and which they saw must end in their ruin and captivity;\r\nstill, none of them dared to speak openly of capitulation, or even to\r\nmanifest their grief, lest they should awaken the wrath of their fierce\r\ndefenders. They surrounded their civic champion, Ali Dordux, the great\r\nand opulent merchant, who had buckled on shield and cuirass and taken\r\nspear in hand for the defence of his native city, and with a large body\r\nof the braver citizens had charge of one of the gates and a considerable\r\nportion of the walls. Drawing Ali Dordux aside, they poured forth their\r\ngriefs to him in secret. “Why,” said they, “should we suffer our native\r\ncity to be made a mere bulwark and fighting-place for foreign barbarians\r\nand desperate men? They have no families to care for, no property to\r\nlose, no love for the soil, and no value for their lives. They fight to\r\ngratify a thirst for blood or a desire for revenge, and will fight on\r\nuntil Malaga becomes a ruin and its people slaves. Let us think and act\r\nfor ourselves, our wives, and our children. Let us make private terms\r\nwith the Christians before it is too late, and save ourselves from\r\ndestruction.”\r\n\r\nThe bowels of Ali Dordux yearned toward his fellow citizens; he\r\nbethought him also of the sweet security of peace and the bloodless\r\nyet gratifying triumphs of gainful traffic. The idea also of a secret\r\nnegotiation or bargain with the Castilian sovereigns for the redemption\r\nof his native city was more conformable to his accustomed habits than\r\nthis violent appeal to arms, for, though he had for a time assumed\r\nthe warrior, he had not forgotten the merchant. Ali Dordux communed,\r\ntherefore, with the citizen-soldiers under his command, and they readily\r\nconformed to his opinion. Concerting together, they wrote a proposition\r\nto the Castilian sovereigns, offering to admit the army into the part\r\nof the city entrusted to their care on receiving assurance of protection\r\nfor the lives and properties of the inhabitants. This writing they\r\ndelivered to a trusty emissary to take to the Christian camp, appointing\r\nthe hour and place of his return that they might be ready to admit him\r\nunperceived.\r\n\r\nThe Moor made his way in safety to the camp, and was admitted to the\r\npresence of the sovereigns. Eager to gain the city without further\r\ncost of blood or treasure, they gave a written promise to grant the\r\ncondition, and the Moor set out joyfully on his return. As he approached\r\nthe walls where Ali Dordux and his confederates were waiting to receive\r\nhim, he was descried by a patrolling band of Gomeres, and considered a\r\nspy coming from the camp of the besiegers. They issued forth and seized\r\nhim in sight of his employers, who gave themselves up for lost. The\r\nGomeres had conducted him nearly to the gate, when he escaped from their\r\ngrasp and fled. They endeavored to overtake him, but were encumbered\r\nwith armor; he was lightly clad, and he fled for his life. One of\r\nthe Gomeres paused, and, levelling his crossbow, let fly a bolt which\r\npierced the fugitive between the shoulders; he fell and was nearly\r\nwithin their grasp, but rose again and with a desperate effort attained\r\nthe Christian camp. The Gomeres gave over the pursuit, and the citizens\r\nreturned thanks to Allah for their deliverance from this fearful\r\nperil. As to the faithful messenger, he died of his wound shortly after\r\nreaching the camp, consoled with the idea that he had preserved the\r\nsecret and the lives of his employers.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Pulgar, Cronica, p. 3, c. 80.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII.\r\n\r\nSUFFERINGS OF THE PEOPLE OF MALAGA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sufferings of Malaga spread sorrow and anxiety among the Moors, and\r\nthey dreaded lest this beautiful city, once the bulwark of the kingdom,\r\nshould fall into the hands of the unbelievers. The old warrior-king,\r\nAbdallah el Zagal, was still sheltered in Guadix, where he was slowly\r\ngathering together his shattered forces. When the people of Guadix\r\nheard of the danger and distress of Malaga, they urged to be led to its\r\nrelief, and the alfaquis admonished El Zagal not to desert so righteous\r\nand loyal a city in its extremity. His own warlike nature made him\r\nfeel a sympathy for a place that made so gallant a resistance, and he\r\ndespatched as powerful a reinforcement as he could spare under conduct\r\nof a chosen captain, with orders to throw themselves into the city.\r\n\r\nIntelligence of this reinforcement reached Boabdil el Chico in his royal\r\npalace of the Alhambra. Filled with hostility against his uncle,\r\nand desirous of proving his loyalty to the Castilian sovereigns, he\r\nimmediately sent forth a superior force of horse and foot under an able\r\ncommander to intercept the detachment. A sharp conflict ensued;\r\nthe troops of El Zagal were routed with great loss and fled back in\r\nconfusion to Guadix.\r\n\r\nBoabdil, not being accustomed to victories, was flushed with this\r\nmelancholy triumph. He sent tidings of it to the Castilian sovereigns,\r\naccompanied with rich silks, boxes of Arabian perfume, a cup of gold\r\nrichly wrought, and a female captive of Ubeda as presents to the queen,\r\nand four Arabian steeds magnificently caparisoned, a sword and dagger\r\nrichly mounted, and several albornozes and other robes sumptuously\r\nembroidered for the king. He entreated them at the same time always to\r\nlook upon him with favor as their devoted vassal.\r\n\r\nBoabdil was fated to be unfortunate, even in his victories. His defeat\r\nof the forces of his uncle destined to the relief of unhappy Malaga\r\nshocked the feelings and cooled the loyalty of many of his best\r\nadherents. The mere men of traffic might rejoice in their golden\r\ninterval of peace, but the chivalrous spirits of Granada spurned a\r\nsecurity purchased by such sacrifices of pride and affection. The people\r\nat large, having gratified their love of change, began to question\r\nwhether they had acted generously by their old fighting monarch. “El\r\nZagal,” said they, “was fierce and bloody, but then he was faithful to\r\nhis country; he was an usurper, it is true, but then he maintained the\r\nglory of the crown which he usurped. If his sceptre was a rod of iron\r\nto his subjects, it was a sword of steel against their enemies. This\r\nBoabdil sacrifices religion, friends, country, everything, to a mere\r\nshadow of royalty, and is content to hold a rush for a sceptre.”\r\n\r\nThese factious murmurs soon reached the ears of Boabdil, and he\r\napprehended another of his customary reverses. He sent in all haste\r\nto the Castilian sovereigns beseeching military aid to keep him on his\r\nthrone. Ferdinand graciously complied with a request so much in unison\r\nwith his policy. A detachment of one thousand cavalry and two thousand\r\ninfantry was sent under the command of Don Fernandez Gonsalvo of\r\nCordova, subsequently renowned as the grand captain. With this succor\r\nBoabdil expelled from the city all those who were hostile to him and\r\nin favor of his uncle. He felt secure in these troops, from their being\r\ndistinct in manners, language, and religion from his subjects, and\r\ncompromised with his pride in thus exhibiting that most unnatural and\r\nhumiliating of all regal spectacles, a monarch supported on his throne\r\nby foreign weapons and by soldiers hostile to his people. Nor was\r\nBoabdil el Chico the only Moorish sovereign that sought protection from\r\nFerdinand and Isabella. A splendid galley with latine sails and several\r\nbanks of oars, displaying the standard of the Crescent, but likewise a\r\nwhite flag in sign of amity, came one day into the harbor. An ambassador\r\nlanded from it within the Christian lines. He came from the king of\r\nTremezan, and brought presents similar to those of Boabdil, consisting\r\nof Arabian coursers, with bits, stirrups, and other furniture of gold,\r\ntogether with costly Moorish mantles: for the queen there were sumptuous\r\nshawls, robes, and silken stuffs, ornaments of gold, and exquisite\r\nOriental perfumes.\r\n\r\nThe king of Tremezan had been alarmed at the rapid conquests of the\r\nSpanish arms, and startled by the descent of several Spanish cruisers\r\non the coast of Africa. He craved to be considered a vassal to the\r\nCastilian sovereigns, and that they would extend such favor and security\r\nto his ships and subjects as had been shown to other Moors who had\r\nsubmitted to their sway. He requested a painting of their arms, that\r\nhe and his subjects might recognize and respect their standard whenever\r\nthey encountered it. At the same time he implored their clemency toward\r\nunhappy Malaga, and that its inhabitants might experience the same favor\r\nthat had been shown toward the Moors of other captured cities.\r\n\r\nThe embassy was graciously received by the Christian sovereigns. They\r\ngranted the protection required, ordering their commanders to respect\r\nthe flag of Tremezan unless it should be found rendering assistance\r\nto the enemy. They sent also to the Barbary monarch their royal arms\r\nmoulded in escutcheons of gold, a hand’s-breadth in size.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Cura de los Palacios, c. 84; Pulgar, part 3, c. 68.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile thus the chances of assistance from without daily decreased,\r\nfamine raged in the city. The inhabitants were compelled to eat the\r\nflesh of horses, and many died of hunger. What made the sufferings of\r\nthe citizens the more intolerable was to behold the sea covered with\r\nships daily arriving with provisions for the besiegers. Day after day\r\nalso they saw herds of fat cattle and flocks of sheep driven into the\r\ncamp. Wheat and flour were piled in huge mounds in the centre of the\r\nencampments, glaring in the sunshine, and tantalizing the wretched\r\ncitizens, who, while they and their children were perishing with hunger,\r\nbeheld prodigal abundance reigning within a bow-shot of their walls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX.\r\n\r\nHOW A MOORISH SANTON UNDERTOOK TO DELIVER THE CITY OF MALAGA FROM THE\r\nPOWER OF ITS ENEMIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere lived at this time in a hamlet in the neighborhood of Guadix an\r\nancient Moor of the name of Ibrahim el Guerbi. He was a native of the\r\nisland of Guerbes, in the kingdom of Tunis, and had for several years\r\nled the life of a santon or hermit. The hot sun of Africa had dried his\r\nblood, and rendered him of an exalted yet melancholy temperament. He\r\npassed most of his time in caves of the mountains in meditation,\r\nprayer, and rigorous abstinence, until his body was wasted and his mind\r\nbewildered, and he fancied himself favored with divine revelations and\r\nvisited by angels sent by Mahomet. The Moors, who had a great reverence\r\nfor all enthusiasts of the kind, believed in his being inspired,\r\nlistened to all his ravings as veritable prophecies, and denominated him\r\n“el santo,” or the saint.\r\n\r\nThe woes of the kingdom of Granada had long exasperated the gloomy\r\nspirit of this man, and he had beheld with indignation this beautiful\r\ncountry wrested from the dominion of the faithful and becoming a prey\r\nto the unbelievers. He had implored the blessings of Allah on the troops\r\nwhich issued forth from Guadix for the relief of Malaga, but when he saw\r\nthem return routed and scattered by their own countrymen, he retired to\r\nhis cell, shut himself up from the world, and was plunged for a time in\r\nthe blackest melancholy.\r\n\r\nOn a sudden he made his appearance again in the streets of Guadix, his\r\nface haggard, his form emaciated, but his eyes beaming with fire. He\r\nsaid that Allah had sent an angel to him in the solitude of his cell,\r\nrevealing to him a mode of delivering Malaga from its perils and\r\nstriking horror and confusion into the camp of the unbelievers. The\r\nMoors listened with eager credulity to his words: four hundred of them\r\noffered to follow him even to the death and to obey implicitly his\r\ncommands. Of this number many were Gomeres, anxious to relieve their\r\ncountrymen who formed part of the garrison of Malaga.\r\n\r\nThey traversed the kingdom by the wild and lonely passes of the\r\nmountains, concealing themselves in the day and travelling only in\r\nthe night to elude the Christian scouts. At length they arrived at the\r\nmountains which tower above Malaga, and, looking down, beheld the city\r\ncompletely invested, a chain of encampments extending round it from\r\nshore to shore and a line of ships blockading it by sea, while the\r\ncontinual thunder of artillery and the smoke rising in various parts\r\nshowed that the siege was pressed with great activity. The hermit\r\nscanned the encampments warily from his lofty height. He saw that the\r\npart of the encampment of the marques of Cadiz which was at the foot of\r\nthe height and on the margin of the sea was most assailable, the rocky\r\nsoil not admitting ditches or palisadoes. Remaining concealed all day,\r\nhe descended with his followers at night to the sea-coast and approached\r\nsilently to the outworks. He had given them their instructions: they\r\nwere to rush suddenly upon the camp, fight their way through, and throw\r\nthemselves into the city.\r\n\r\nIt was just at the gray of the dawning, when objects are obscurely\r\nvisible, that they made this desperate attempt. Some sprang suddenly\r\nupon the sentinels, others rushed into the sea and got round the works,\r\nothers clambered over the breastworks. There was sharp skirmishing;\r\na great part of the Moors were cut to pieces, but about two hundred\r\nsucceeded in getting into the gates of Malaga.\r\n\r\nThe santon took no part in the conflict, nor did he endeavor to enter\r\nthe city. His plans were of a different nature. Drawing apart from the\r\nbattle, he threw himself on his knees on a rising ground, and, lifting\r\nhis hands to heaven, appeared to be absorbed in prayer. The Christians,\r\nas they were searching for fugitives in the clefts of the rocks, found\r\nhim at his devotions. He stirred not at their approach, but remained\r\nfixed as a statue, without changing color or moving a muscle. Filled\r\nwith surprise, not unmingled with awe, they took him to the marques of\r\nCadiz. He was wrapped in a coarse albornoz, or Moorish mantle, his beard\r\nwas long and grizzled, and there was something wild and melancholy in\r\nhis look that inspired curiosity. On being examined, he gave himself out\r\nas a saint to whom Allah had revealed the events that were to take place\r\nin that siege. The marques demanded when and how Malaga was to be taken.\r\nHe replied that he knew full well, but he was forbidden to reveal those\r\nimportant secrets except to the king and queen. The good marques was not\r\nmore given to superstitious fancies than other commanders of his time,\r\nyet there seemed something singular and mysterious about this man;\r\nhe might have some important intelligence to communicate; so he was\r\npersuaded to send him to the king and queen. He was conducted to the\r\nroyal tent, surrounded by a curious multitude exclaiming “El Moro\r\nSanto!” for the news had spread through the camp that they had taken a\r\nMoorish prophet.\r\n\r\nThe king, having dined, was taking his siesta, or afternoon’s sleep, in\r\nhis tent, and the queen, though curious to see this singular man, yet\r\nfrom a natural delicacy and reserve delayed until the king should be\r\npresent. He was taken, therefore, to an adjoining tent, in which were\r\nDona Beatrix de Bovadilla, marchioness of Moya, and Don Alvaro of\r\nPortugal, son of the duke of Braganza, with two or three attendants.\r\nThe Moor, ignorant of the Spanish tongue, had not understood the\r\nconversation of the guards, and supposed, from the magnificence of the\r\nfurniture and the silken hangings, that this was the royal tent. From\r\nthe respect paid by the attendants to Don Alvaro and the marchioness he\r\nconcluded that they were the king and queen.\r\n\r\nHe now asked for a draught of water: a jar was brought to him, and the\r\nguard released his arm to enable him to drink. The marchioness perceived\r\na sudden change in his countenance and something sinister in the\r\nexpression of his eye, and shifted her position to a more remote part of\r\nthe tent. Pretending to raise the water to his lips, the Moor unfolded\r\nhis albornoz, so as to grasp a scimetar which he wore concealed beneath;\r\nthen, dashing down the jar, he drew his weapon and gave Don Alvaro a\r\nblow on the head that struck him to the earth and nearly deprived him of\r\nlife. Turning then upon the marchioness, he made a violent blow at her;\r\nbut in his eagerness and agitation his scimetar caught in the drapery\r\nof the tent; the force of the blow was broken, and the weapon struck\r\nharmless upon some golden ornaments of her head-dress.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Pietro Martyr, Epist. 62.\r\n\r\n\r\nRuy Lopez de Toledo, treasurer to the queen, and Juan de Belalcazar,\r\na sturdy friar, who were present, grappled and struggled with the\r\ndesperado, and immediately the guards who had conducted him from the\r\nmarques de Cadiz fell upon him and cut him to pieces.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Cura de los Palacios\r\n\r\n\r\nThe king and queen, brought out of their tents by the noise, were filled\r\nwith horror when they learned the imminent peril from which they had\r\nescaped. The mangled body of the Moor was taken by the people to the\r\ncamp and thrown into the city from a catapult. The Gomeres gathered up\r\nthe body with deep reverence as the remains of a saint; they washed and\r\nperfumed it and buried it with great honor and loud lamentations.\r\nIn revenge of his death they slew one of their principal Christian\r\ncaptives, and, having tied his body upon an ass, they drove the animal\r\nforth into the camp.\r\n\r\nFrom this time there was appointed an additional guard around the tents\r\nof the king and queen, composed of four hundred cavaliers of rank of\r\nthe kingdoms of Castile and Aragon. No person was admitted to the royal\r\npresence armed; no Moor was allowed to enter the camp without a previous\r\nknowledge of his character and business; and on no account was any Moor\r\nto be introduced into the presence of the sovereigns.\r\n\r\nAn act of treachery of such ferocious nature gave rise to a train of\r\ngloomy apprehensions. There were many cabins and sheds about the camp\r\nconstructed of branches of trees which had become dry and combustible,\r\nand fears were entertained that they might be set on fire by the\r\nmudexares, or Moorish vassals, who visited the army. Some even dreaded\r\nthat attempts might be made to poison the wells and fountains. To quiet\r\nthese dismal alarms all mudexares were ordered to leave the camp,\r\nand all loose, idle loiterers who could not give a good account of\r\nthemselves were taken into custody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX.\r\n\r\nHOW HAMET EL ZEGRI WAS HARDENED IN HIS OBSTINACY BY THE ARTS OF A\r\nMOORISH ASTROLOGER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong those followers of the santon that had effected their entrance\r\ninto the city was a dark African of the tribe of the Gomeres, who was\r\nlikewise a hermit or dervise and passed among the Moors for a holy and\r\ninspired man. No sooner were the mangled remains of his predecessor\r\nburied with the honors of martyrdom than this dervise elevated himself\r\nin his place and professed to be gifted with the spirit of prophecy. He\r\ndisplayed a white banner, which he assured the Moors was sacred, that he\r\nhad retained it for twenty years for some signal purpose, and that Allah\r\nhad revealed to him that under that banner the inhabitants of Malaga\r\nshould sally forth upon the camp of the unbelievers, put it to utter\r\nrout, and banquet upon the provisions in which it abounded.* The hungry\r\nand credulous Moors were elated at this prediction, and cried out to be\r\nled forth at once to the attack; but the dervise told them the time was\r\nnot yet arrived, for every event had its allotted day in the decrees\r\nof fate: they must wait patiently, therefore, until the appointed time\r\nshould be revealed to him by Heaven. Hamet el Zegri listened to the\r\ndervise with profound reverence, and his example had great effect in\r\nincreasing the awe and deference of his followers. He took the holy man\r\nup into his stronghold of Gibralfaro, consulted him on all occasions,\r\nand hung out his white banner on the loftiest tower as a signal of\r\nencouragement to the people of the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Cura de los Palacios, cap. 84.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the prime chivalry of Spain was gradually assembling\r\nbefore the walls of Malaga. The army which had commenced the siege had\r\nbeen worn out by extreme hardships, having had to construct immense\r\nworks, to dig trenches and mines, to mount guard by sea and land, to\r\npatrol the mountains, and to sustain incessant conflicts. The sovereigns\r\nwere obliged, therefore, to call upon various distant cities for\r\nreinforcements of horse and foot. Many nobles also assembled their\r\nvassals and repaired of their own accord to the royal camp.\r\n\r\nEvery little while some stately galley or gallant caravel would stand\r\ninto the harbor, displaying the well-known banner of some Spanish\r\ncavalier and thundering from its artillery a salutation to the\r\nsovereigns and a defiance to the Moors. On the land side also\r\nreinforcements would be seen winding down from the mountains to the\r\nsound of drum and trumpet, and marching into the camp with glistening\r\narms as yet unsullied by the toils of war.\r\n\r\nOne morning the whole sea was whitened by the sails and vexed by the\r\noars of ships and galleys bearing toward the port. One hundred vessels\r\nof various kinds and sizes arrived, some armed for warlike service,\r\nothers deep freighted with provisions. At the same time the clangor of\r\ndrum and trumpet bespoke the arrival of a powerful force by land,\r\nwhich came pouring in lengthening columns into the camp. This mighty\r\nreinforcement was furnished by the duke of Medina Sidonia, who reigned\r\nlike a petty monarch over his vast possessions. He came with this\r\nprincely force a volunteer to the royal standard, not having been\r\nsummoned by the sovereigns, and he brought, moreover, a loan of twenty\r\nthousand doblas of gold.\r\n\r\nWhen the camp was thus powerfully reinforced Isabella advised that new\r\noffers of an indulgent kind should be made to the inhabitants, for\r\nshe was anxious to prevent the miseries of a protracted siege or the\r\neffusion of blood that must attend a general attack. A fresh summons\r\nwas therefore sent for the city to surrender, with a promise of life,\r\nliberty, and property in case of immediate compliance, but denouncing\r\nall the horrors of war if the defence were obstinately continued.\r\n\r\nHamet again rejected the offer with scorn. His main fortifications\r\nas yet were but little impaired, and were capable of holding out much\r\nlonger; he trusted to the thousand evils and accidents that beset a\r\nbesieging army and to the inclemencies of the approaching season; and it\r\nis said that he, as well as his followers, had an infatuated belief in\r\nthe predictions of the dervise.\r\n\r\nThe worthy Fray Antonio Agapida does not scruple to affirm that the\r\npretended prophet of the city was an arch nigromancer, or Moorish\r\nmagician, “of which there be countless many,” says he, “in the filthy\r\nsect of Mahomet,” and that he was leagued with the prince of the powers\r\nof the air to endeavor to work the confusion and defeat of the Christian\r\narmy. The worthy father asserts also that Hamet employed him in a high\r\ntower of the Gibralfaro, which commanded a wide view over sea and land,\r\nwhere he wrought spells and incantations with astrolabes and other\r\ndiabolical instruments to defeat the Christian ships and forces whenever\r\nthey were engaged with the Moors.\r\n\r\nTo the potent spells of this sorcerer he ascribes the perils and losses\r\nsustained by a party of cavaliers of the royal household in a desperate\r\ncombat to gain two towers of the suburb near the gate of the city called\r\nla Puerto de Granada. The Christians, led on by Ruy Lopez de Toledo,\r\nthe valiant treasurer of the queen, took and lost and retook the towers,\r\nwhich were finally set on fire by the Moors and abandoned to the flames\r\nby both parties. To the same malignant influence he attributes the\r\ndamage done to the Christian fleet, which was so vigorously assailed\r\nby the albatozas, or floating batteries, of the Moors that one ship,\r\nbelonging to the duke of Medina Sidonia, was sunk and the rest were\r\nobliged to retire.\r\n\r\n“Hamet el Zegri,” says Fray Antonio Agapida, “stood on the top of\r\nthe high tower of Gibralfaro and beheld this injury wrought upon the\r\nChristian force, and his proud heart was puffed up. And the Moorish\r\nnigromancer stood beside him. And he pointed out to him the Christian\r\nhost below, encamped on every eminence around the city and covering its\r\nfertile valley, and the many ships floating upon the tranquil sea, and\r\nhe bade him be strong of heart, for that in a few days all this mighty\r\nfleet would be scattered by the winds of heaven, and that he should\r\nsally forth under the guidance of the sacred banner and attack this\r\nhost, and utterly defeat it, and make spoil of those sumptuous tents;\r\nand Malaga should be triumphantly revenged upon her assailants. So the\r\nheart of Hamet was hardened like that of Pharaoh, and he persisted in\r\nsetting at defiance the Catholic sovereigns and their army of saintly\r\nwarriors.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXI.\r\n\r\nSIEGE OF MALAGA CONTINUED.--DESTRUCTION OF A TOWER BY FRANCISCO RAMIREZ\r\nDE MADRID.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeeing the infatuated obstinacy of the besieged, the Christians now\r\napproached their works to the walls, gaining one position after another\r\npreparatory to a general assault. Near the barrier of the city was a\r\nbridge with four arches, defended at each end by a strong and lofty\r\ntower, by which a part of the army would have to pass in making an\r\nattack. The commander-in-chief of the artillery, Francisco Ramirez de\r\nMadrid, was ordered to take possession of this bridge. The approach\r\nto it was perilous in the extreme, from the exposed situation of the\r\nassailants and the number of Moors that garrisoned the towers. Francisco\r\nRamirez therefore secretly excavated a mine leading beneath the first\r\ntower, and placed a piece of ordnance with its mouth upward immediately\r\nunder the foundation, with a train of powder to produce an explosion at\r\nthe necessary moment.\r\n\r\nWhen this was arranged he advanced slowly with his forces in face of the\r\ntowers, erecting bulwarks at every step, and gradually gaining ground\r\nuntil he arrived near to the bridge. He then planted several pieces of\r\nartillery in his works and began to batter the tower. The Moors replied\r\nbravely from their battlements, but in the heat of the combat the piece\r\nof ordnance under the foundation was discharged. The earth was rent\r\nopen, a part of the tower overthrown, and several of the Moors were\r\ntorn to pieces; the rest took to flight, overwhelmed with terror at this\r\nthundering explosion bursting beneath their feet and at beholding the\r\nearth vomiting flames and smoke, for never before had they witnessed\r\nsuch a stratagem in warfare. The Christians rushed forward and took\r\npossession of the abandoned post, and immediately commenced an attack\r\nupon the other tower at the opposite end of the bridge, to which the\r\nMoors had retired. An incessant fire of crossbows and arquebuses was\r\nkept up between the rival towers, volleys of stones were discharged, and\r\nno one dared to venture upon the intermediate bridge.\r\n\r\nFrancisco de Ramirez at length renewed his former mode of approach,\r\nmaking bulwarks step by step, while the Moors, stationed at the other\r\nend, swept the bridge with their artillery. The combat was long and\r\nbloody--furious on the part of the Moors, patient and persevering on the\r\npart of the Christians. By slow degrees they accomplished their advance\r\nacross the bridge, drove the enemy before them, and remained masters of\r\nthis important pass.\r\n\r\nFor this valiant and skilful achievement King Ferdinand after the\r\nsurrender of the city conferred the dignity of knighthood upon Francisco\r\nRamirez in the tower which he had so gloriously gained.* The worthy\r\npadre Fray Antonio Agapida indulges in more than a page of extravagant\r\neulogy upon this invention of blowing up the foundation of the tower by\r\na piece of ordnance; which, in fact, is said to be the first instance on\r\nrecord of gunpowder being used in a mine.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Pulgar, part 3, c. 91.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXII.\r\n\r\nHOW THE PEOPLE OF MALAGA EXPOSTULATED WITH HAMET EL ZEGRI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the dervise was deluding the garrison of Malaga with vain hopes\r\nthe famine increased to a terrible degree. The Gomeres ranged about the\r\ncity as though it had been a conquered place, taking by force whatever\r\nthey found eatable in the houses of the peaceful citizens, and breaking\r\nopen vaults and cellars and demolishing walls wherever they thought\r\nprovisions might be concealed.\r\n\r\nThe wretched inhabitants had no longer bread to eat; the horse-flesh\r\nalso now failed them, and they were fain to devour skins and hides\r\ntoasted at the fire, and to assuage the hunger of their children with\r\nvine-leaves cut up and fried in oil. Many perished of famine or of the\r\nunwholesome food with which they endeavored to relieve it, and many took\r\nrefuge in the Christian camp, preferring captivity to the horrors which\r\nsurrounded them.\r\n\r\nAt length the sufferings of the inhabitants became so great as to\r\nconquer even their fears of Hamet and his Gomeres. They assembled before\r\nthe house of Ali Dordux, the wealthy merchant, whose stately mansion\r\nwas at the foot of the hill of the Alcazaba, and they urged him to stand\r\nforth as their leader and to intercede with Hamet for a surrender. Ali\r\nDordux was a man of courage as well as policy; he perceived also that\r\nhunger was giving boldness to the citizens, while he trusted it was\r\nsubduing the fierceness of the soldiery. He armed himself, therefore,\r\ncap-a-pie, and undertook this dangerous parley with the alcayde. He\r\nassociated with him an alfaqui named Abraham Alhariz and an important\r\ninhabitant named Amar ben Amar, and they ascended to the fortress of\r\nGibralfaro, followed by several of the trembling merchants.\r\n\r\nThey found Hamet el Zegri, not, as before, surrounded by ferocious\r\nguards and all the implements of war, but in a chamber of one of the\r\nlofty towers, at a table of stone covered with scrolls traced with\r\nstrange characters and mystic diagrams, while instruments of singular\r\nand unknown form lay about the room. Beside Hamet stood the prophetic\r\ndervise, who appeared to have been explaining to him the mysterious\r\ninscriptions of the scrolls. His presence filled the citizens with awe,\r\nfor even Ali Dordux considered him a man inspired.\r\n\r\nThe alfaqui, Abraham Alhariz, whose sacred character gave him boldness\r\nto speak, now lifted up his voice and addressed Hamet el Zegri. “We\r\nimplore thee,” said he, solemnly, “in the name of the most powerful\r\nGod, no longer to persist in a vain resistance which must end in\r\nour destruction, but deliver up the city while clemency is yet to be\r\nobtained. Think how many of our warriors have fallen by\r\nthe sword; do not suffer those who survive to perish by famine. Our\r\nwives and children cry to us for bread, and we have none to give them.\r\nWe see them expire in lingering agony before our eyes, while the enemy\r\nmocks our misery by displaying the abundance of his camp. Of what avail\r\nis our defence? Are our walls, peradventure, more strong than the walls\r\nof Ronda? Are our warriors more brave than the defenders of Loxa?\r\nThe walls of Ronda were thrown down and the warriors of Loxa had to\r\nsurrender. Do we hope for succor?--whence are we to receive it? The time\r\nfor hope is gone by. Granada has lost its power; it no longer possesses\r\nchivalry, commanders, nor a king. Boabdil sits a vassal in the degraded\r\nhalls of the Alhambra; El Zagal is a fugitive, shut up within the walls\r\nof Guadix. The kingdom is divided against itself--its strength is gone,\r\nits pride fallen, its very existence at an end. In the name of Allah\r\nwe conjure thee, who art our captain, be not our direst enemy, but\r\nsurrender these ruins of our once-happy Malaga and deliver us from these\r\noverwhelming horrors.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the supplication forced from the inhabitants by the extremity\r\nof their sufferings. Hamet listened to the alfaqui without anger, for he\r\nrespected the sanctity of his office. His heart too was at that moment\r\nlifted up with a vain confidence. “Yet a few days of patience,” said he,\r\n“and all these evils will suddenly have an end. I have been conferring\r\nwith this holy man, and find that the time of our deliverance is at\r\nhand. The decrees of fate are inevitable; it is written in the book\r\nof destiny that we shall sally forth and destroy the camp of the\r\nunbelievers, and banquet upon those mountains of grain which are piled\r\nup in the midst of it. So Allah hath promised by the mouth of this his\r\nprophet. Allah Akbar! God is great! Let no man oppose the decrees of\r\nHeaven!”\r\n\r\nThe citizens bowed with profound reverence, for no true Moslem pretends\r\nto struggle against whatever is written in the book of fate. Ali Dordux,\r\nwho had come prepared to champion the city and to brave the ire of\r\nHamet, humbled himself before this holy man and gave faith to his\r\nprophecies as the revelations of Allah. So the deputies returned to the\r\ncitizens, and exhorted them to be of good cheer. “A few days longer,”\r\n said they, “and our sufferings are to terminate. When the white banner\r\nis removed from the tower, then look out for deliverance, for the hour\r\nof sallying forth will have arrived.” The people retired to their homes\r\nwith sorrowful hearts; they tried in vain to quiet the cries of their\r\nfamishing children, and day by day and hour by hour their anxious eyes\r\nwere turned to the sacred banner, which still continued to wave on the\r\ntower of Gibralfaro.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIII.\r\n\r\nHOW HAMET EL ZEGRI SALLIED FORTH WITH THE SACRED BANNER TO ATTACK THE\r\nCHRISTIAN CAMP.\r\n\r\n\r\n“The Moorish nigromancer,” observes the worthy Fray Antonio Agapida,\r\n“remained shut up in a tower of the Gibralfaro devising devilish means\r\nto work mischief and discomfiture upon the Christians. He was daily\r\nconsulted by Hamet, who had great faith in those black and magic arts\r\nwhich he had brought with him from the bosom of heathen Africa.”\r\n\r\nFrom the account given of this dervise and his incantations by the\r\nworthy father it would appear that he was an astrologer, and was\r\nstudying the stars and endeavoring to calculate the day and hour when a\r\nsuccessful attack might be made upon the Christian camp.\r\n\r\nFamine had now increased to such a degree as to distress even the\r\ngarrison of Gibralfaro, although the Gomeres had seized upon all the\r\nprovisions they could find in the city. Their passions were sharpened by\r\nhunger, and they became restless and turbulent and impatient for action.\r\n\r\nHamet was one day in council with his captains, perplexed by the\r\npressure of events, when the dervise entered among them. “The hour of\r\nvictory,” exclaimed he, “is at hand. Allah has commanded that to-morrow\r\nmorning ye shall sally forth to the fight. I will bear before you\r\nthe sacred banner and deliver your enemies into your hands. Remember,\r\nhowever, that ye are but instruments in the hands of Allah to take\r\nvengeance on the enemies of the faith. Go into battle, therefore, with\r\npure hearts, forgiving each other all past offences, for those who are\r\ncharitable toward each other will be victorious over the foe.” The\r\nwords of the dervise were received with rapture; all Gibralfaro and\r\nthe Alcazaba resounded immediately with the din of arms, and Hamet sent\r\nthroughout the towers and fortifications of the city and selected\r\nthe choicest troops and most distinguished captains for this eventful\r\ncombat.\r\n\r\nIn the morning early the rumor went throughout the city that the sacred\r\nbanner had disappeared from the tower of Gibralfaro, and all Malaga was\r\nroused to witness the sally that was to destroy the unbelievers. Hamet\r\ndescended from his stronghold, accompanied by his principal captain,\r\nIbrahim Zenete, and followed by his Gomeres. The dervise led the way,\r\ndisplaying the white banner, the sacred pledge of victory. The multitude\r\nshouted “Allah Akbar!” and prostrated themselves before the banner as\r\nit passed. Even the dreaded Hamet was hailed with praises, for in their\r\nhopes of speedy relief through the prowess of his arm the populace\r\nforgot everything but his bravery. Every bosom in Malaga was agitated\r\nby hope and fear: the old men, the women, and children, and all who went\r\nnot forth to battle mounted on tower and battlement and roof to watch a\r\ncombat that was to decide their fate.\r\n\r\nBefore sallying forth from the city the dervise addressed the troops,\r\nreminding them of the holy nature of this enterprise, and warning them\r\nnot to forfeit the protection of the sacred banner by any unworthy act.\r\nThey were not to pause to make spoil nor to take prisoners: they were to\r\npress forward, fighting valiantly, and granting no quarter. The gate was\r\nthen thrown open, and the dervise issued forth, followed by the army.\r\nThey directed their assaults upon the encampments of the master of\r\nSantiago and the master of Alcantara, and came upon them so suddenly\r\nthat they killed and wounded several of the guards. Ibrahim Zenete\r\nmade his way into one of the tents, where he beheld several Christian\r\nstriplings just starting from their slumber. The heart of the Moor was\r\nsuddenly touched with pity for their youth, or perhaps he scorned the\r\nweakness of the foe.\r\n\r\nHe smote them with the flat instead of the edge of the sword. “Away,\r\nimps!” cried he, “away to your mothers!” The fanatic dervise reproached\r\nhim with his clemency. “I did not kill them,” replied Zenete, “because I\r\nsaw no beards!”*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Cura de los Palacios, c. 84.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe alarm was given in the camp, and the Christians rushed from all\r\nquarters to defend the gates of the bulwarks. Don Pedro Puerto\r\nCarrero, senior of Moguer, and his brother, Don Alonzo Pacheco, planted\r\nthemselves with their followers in the gateway of the encampment of the\r\nmaster of Santiago, and bore the whole brunt of battle until they were\r\nreinforced. The gate of the encampment of the master of Calatrava was in\r\nlike manner defended by Lorenzo Saurez de Mendoza. Hamet was furious at\r\nbeing thus checked where he had expected a miraculous victory. He led\r\nhis troops repeatedly to the attack, hoping to force the gates before\r\nsuccor should arrive: they fought with vehement ardor, but were as often\r\nrepulsed, and every time they returned to the assault they found their\r\nenemies doubled in number. The Christians opened a cross-fire of all\r\nkinds of missiles from their bulwarks; the Moors could effect but\r\nlittle damage upon a foe thus protected behind their works, while they\r\nthemselves were exposed from head to foot. The Christians singled out\r\nthe most conspicuous cavaliers, the greater part of whom were either\r\nslain or wounded. Still, the Moors, infatuated by the predictions of\r\nthe prophet, fought desperately and devotedly, and they were furious to\r\nrevenge the slaughter of their leaders. They rushed upon certain death,\r\nendeavoring madly to scale the bulwarks or force the gates, and fell\r\namidst showers of darts and lances, filling the ditches with their\r\nmangled bodies.\r\n\r\nHamet el Zegri raged along the front of the bulwarks seeking an opening\r\nfor attack. He gnashed his teeth with fury as he saw so many of his\r\nchosen warriors slain around him. He seemed to have a charmed life,\r\nfor, though constantly in the hottest of the fight amidst showers of\r\nmissiles, he still escaped uninjured. Blindly confiding in the prophecy\r\nof victory, he continued to urge on his devoted troops. The dervise\r\ntoo ran like a maniac through the ranks, waving his white banner and\r\ninciting the Moors by howlings rather than by shouts. “Fear not! the\r\nvictory is ours, for so it is written!” cried he. In the midst of his\r\nfrenzy a stone from a catapult struck him in the head and dashed out his\r\nbewildered brains.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Garibay, lib. 18, c. 33.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Moors beheld their prophet slain and his banner in the dust,\r\nthey were seized with despair and fled in confusion to the city. Hamet\r\nel Zegri made some effort to rally them, but was himself confounded by\r\nthe fall of the dervise. He covered the flight of his broken forces,\r\nturning repeatedly upon their pursuers and slowly making his retreat\r\ninto the city.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Malaga witnessed from their walls with trembling\r\nanxiety the whole of this disastrous conflict. At the first onset, when\r\nthey beheld the guards of the camp put to flight, they exclaimed, “Allah\r\nhas given us the victory!” and they sent up shouts of triumph. Their\r\nexultation, however, was soon turned into doubt when they beheld their\r\ntroops repulsed in repeated attacks. They could see from time to time\r\nsome distinguished warrior laid low and others brought back bleeding to\r\nthe city. When at length the sacred banner fell and the routed troops\r\ncame flying to the gates, pursued and cut down by the foe, horror and\r\ndespair seized upon the populace.\r\n\r\nAs Hamet entered the gates he heard nothing but loud lamentations:\r\nmothers whose sons had been slain shrieked curses after him as he\r\npassed; some in the anguish of their hearts threw down their famishing\r\nbabes before him, exclaiming, “Trample on them with thy horse’s feet,\r\nfor we have no food to give them, and we cannot endure their cries.” All\r\nheaped execrations on his head as the cause of the woes of Malaga.\r\n\r\nThe warlike part of the citizens also, and many warriors who with\r\ntheir wives and children had taken refuge in Malaga from the\r\nmountain-fortresses, now joined in the popular clamor, for their hearts\r\nwere overcome by the sufferings of their families.\r\n\r\nHamet el Zegri found it impossible to withstand this torrent of\r\nlamentations, curses, and reproaches. His military ascendancy was at an\r\nend, for most of his officers and the prime warriors of his African band\r\nhad fallen in this disastrous sally. Turning his back, therefore, upon\r\nthe city and abandoning it to its own counsels, he retired with the\r\nremnant of his Gomeres to his stronghold in the Gibralfaro.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIV.\r\n\r\nHOW THE CITY OF MALAGA CAPITULATED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe people of Malaga, being no longer overawed by Hamet el Zegri and\r\nhis Gomeres, turned to Ali Dordux, the magnanimous merchant, and put the\r\nfate of the city into his hands. He had already gained the alcaydes of\r\nthe castle of the Genoese and of the citadel into his party, and in the\r\nlate confusion had gained the sway over those important fortresses. He\r\nnow associated himself with the alfaqui Abraham Alhariz and four of\r\nthe principal inhabitants, and, forming a provisional junta, they sent\r\nheralds to the Christian sovereigns offering to surrender the city on\r\ncertain terms protecting the persons and property of the inhabitants,\r\npermitting them to reside as mudexares or tributary vassals either in\r\nMalaga or elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWhen the herald arrived at the camp and made known their mission to King\r\nFerdinand, his anger was kindled. “Return to your fellow-citizens,” said\r\nhe, “and tell them that the day of grace is gone by. They have persisted\r\nin a fruitless defence until they are driven by necessity to capitulate;\r\nthey must surrender unconditionally and abide the fate of the\r\nvanquished. Those who merit death shall suffer death; those who merit\r\ncaptivity shall be made captives.”\r\n\r\nThis stern reply spread consternation among the people of Malaga, but\r\nAli Dordux comforted them, and undertook to go in person and pray for\r\nfavorable terms. When the people beheld this great and wealthy merchant,\r\nwho was so eminent in their city, departing with his associates on this\r\nmission, they plucked up heart, for they said, “Surely the Christian\r\nking will not turn a deaf ear to such a man as Ali Dordux.”\r\n\r\nFerdinand, however, would not even admit the ambassadors to his\r\npresence. “Send them to the devil!” said he in a great passion to the\r\ncommander of Leon; “I’ll not see them. Let them get back to their city.\r\nThey shall all surrender to my mercy as vanquished enemies.” *\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Cura de los Palacios, cap. 84.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo give emphasis to this reply he ordered a general discharge from all\r\nthe artillery and batteries, and there was a great shout throughout\r\nthe camp, and all the lombards and catapults and other engines of war\r\nthundered furiously upon the city, doing great damage.\r\n\r\nAli Dordux and his companions returned to the city with downcast\r\ncountenances, and could scarce make the reply of the Christian sovereign\r\nbe heard for the roaring of the artillery, the tumbling of the\r\nwalls, and the cries of women and children. The citizens were greatly\r\nastonished and dismayed when they found the little respect paid to their\r\nmost eminent man; but the warriors who were in the city exclaimed, “What\r\nhas this merchant to do with questions between men of battle? Let us not\r\naddress the enemy as abject suppliants who have no power to injure, but\r\nas valiant men who have weapons in their hands.”\r\n\r\nSo they despatched another message to the Christian sovereigns, offering\r\nto yield up the city and all their effects on condition of being secured\r\nin their personal liberty. Should this be denied, they declared they\r\nwould hang from the battlements fifteen hundred Christian captives,\r\nmale and female--that they would put all their old men, their women, and\r\nchildren into the citadel, set fire to the city, and sally forth, sword\r\nin hand, to fight until the last gasp. “In this way,” said they, “the\r\nSpanish sovereigns shall gain a bloody victory, and the fall of Malaga\r\nbe renowned while the world endures.”\r\n\r\nTo this fierce and swelling message Ferdinand replied that if a single\r\nChristian captive were injured, not a Moor in Malaga but should be put\r\nto the edge of the sword.\r\n\r\nA great conflict of counsels now arose in Malaga. The warriors were\r\nfor following up their menace by some desperate act of vengeance or of\r\nself-devotion. Those who had families looked with anguish upon their\r\nwives and daughters, and thought it better to die than live to see them\r\ncaptives. By degrees, however, the transports of passion and despair\r\nsubsided, the love of life resumed its sway, and they turned once\r\nmore to Ali Dordux as the man most prudent in council and able in\r\nnegotiation. By his advice fourteen of the principal inhabitants were\r\nchosen from the fourteen districts of the city, and sent to the camp\r\nbearing a long letter couched in terms of the most humble supplication.\r\n\r\nVarious debates now took place in the Christian camp. Many of the\r\ncavaliers were exasperated against Malaga for its long resistance, which\r\nhad caused the death of many of their relatives and favorite companions.\r\nIt had long been a stronghold also for Moorish depredators and the mart\r\nwhere most of the warriors captured in the Axarquia had been exposed in\r\ntriumph and sold to slavery. They represented, moreover, that there were\r\nmany Moorish cities yet to be besieged, and that an example ought to\r\nbe made of Malaga to prevent all obstinate resistance thereafter.\r\nThey advised, therefore, that all the inhabitants should be put to the\r\nsword.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Pulgar.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe humane heart of Isabella revolted at such sanguinary counsels:\r\nshe insisted that their triumph should not be disgraced by cruelty.\r\nFerdinand, however, was inflexible in refusing to grant any preliminary\r\nterms, insisting on an unconditional surrender.\r\n\r\nThe people of Malaga now abandoned themselves to paroxysms of despair;\r\non one side they saw famine and death, on the other slavery and chains.\r\nThe mere men of the sword, who had no families to protect, were loud for\r\nsignalizing their fall by some illustrious action. “Let us sacrifice our\r\nChristian captives, and then destroy ourselves,” cried some. “Let us put\r\nall the women and children to death, set fire to the city, fall on the\r\nChristian camp, and die sword in hand,” cried others.\r\n\r\nAli Dordux gradually made his voice be heard amidst the general clamor.\r\nHe addressed himself to the principal inhabitants and to those who had\r\nchildren. “Let those who live by the sword die by the sword,” cried he,\r\n“but let us not follow their desperate counsels. Who knows what sparks\r\nof pity may be awakened in the bosoms of the Christian sovereigns when\r\nthey behold our unoffending wives and daughters and our helpless little\r\nones? The Christian queen, they say, is full of mercy.”\r\n\r\nAt these words the hearts of the unhappy people of Malaga yearned over\r\ntheir families, and they empowered Ali Dordux to deliver up their city\r\nto the mercy of the Castilian sovereigns.\r\n\r\nThe merchant now went to and fro, and had several communications with\r\nFerdinand and Isabella, and interested several principal cavaliers in\r\nhis cause; and he sent rich presents to the king and queen of Oriental\r\nmerchandise and silks and stuffs of gold and jewels and precious stones\r\nand spices and perfumes, and many other sumptuous things, which he had\r\naccumulated in his great tradings with the East; and he gradually found\r\nfavor in the eyes of the sovereigns.* Finding that there was nothing to\r\nbe obtained for the city, he now, like a prudent man and able merchant,\r\nbegan to negotiate for himself and his immediate friends. He represented\r\nthat from the first they had been desirous of yielding up the city, but\r\nhad been prevented by warlike and high-handed men, who had threatened\r\ntheir lives; he entreated, therefore, that mercy might be extended to\r\nthem, and that they might not be confounded with the guilty.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * MS. Chron. of Valera.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sovereigns had accepted the presents of Ali Dordux--how could they\r\nthen turn a deaf ear to his petition? So they granted a pardon to him\r\nand to forty families which he named, and it was agreed that they should\r\nbe protected in their liberties and property, and permitted to reside\r\nin Malaga as mudexares or Moslem vassals, and to follow their customary\r\npursuits.* All this being arranged, Ali Dordux delivered up twenty of\r\nthe principal inhabitants to remain as hostages until the whole city\r\nshould be placed in the possession of the Christians.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Cura de los Palacios, cap. 84.\r\n\r\n\r\nDon Gutierrez de Cardenas, senior commander of Leon, now entered the\r\ncity armed cap-a-pie, on horseback, and took possession in the name of\r\nthe Castilian sovereigns. He was followed by his retainers and by the\r\ncaptains and cavaliers of the army, and in a little while the standards\r\nof the cross and of the blessed Santiago and of the Catholic sovereigns\r\nwere elevated on the principal tower of the Alcazaba. When these\r\nstandards were beheld from the camp, the queen and the princess and the\r\nladies of the court and all the royal retinue knelt down and gave thanks\r\nand praises to the Holy Virgin and to Santiago for this great triumph\r\nof the faith; and the bishops and other clergy who were present and the\r\nchoristers of the royal chapel chanted “Te Deum Laudamus” and “Gloria in\r\nExcelsis.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXV.\r\n\r\nFULFILMENT OF THE PROPHECY OF THE DERVISE.--FATE OF HAMET EL ZEGRI.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the city delivered up than the wretched inhabitants\r\nimplored permission to purchase bread for themselves and their children\r\nfrom the heaps of grain which they had so often gazed at wistfully from\r\ntheir walls. Their prayer was granted, and they issued forth with\r\nthe famished eagerness of starving men. It was piteous to behold the\r\nstruggles of those unhappy people as they contended who first should\r\nhave their necessities relieved.\r\n\r\n“Thus,” says the pious Fray Antonio Agapida,--“thus are the predictions\r\nof false prophets sometimes permitted to be verified, but always to\r\nthe confusion of those who trust in them; for the words of the Moorish\r\nnigromancer came to pass that the people of Malaga should eat of those\r\nheaps of bread, but they ate in humiliation and defeat and with sorrow\r\nand bitterness of heart.”\r\n\r\nDark and fierce were the feelings of Hamet el Zegri as he looked down\r\nfrom the castle of Gibralfaro and beheld the Christian legions pouring\r\ninto the city and the standard of the cross supplanting the crescent on\r\nthe citadel. “The people of Malaga,” said he, “have trusted to a man of\r\ntrade, and he has trafficked them away; but let us not suffer ourselves\r\nto be bound hand and foot and delivered up as part of his bargain. We\r\nhave yet strong walls around us and trusty weapons in our hands. Let us\r\nfight until buried beneath the last tumbling tower of Gibralfaro, or,\r\nrushing down from among its ruins, carry havoc among the unbelievers as\r\nthey throng the streets of Malaga.”\r\n\r\nThe fierceness of the Gomeres, however, was broken. They could have died\r\nin the breach had their castle been assailed, but the slow advances of\r\nfamine subdued their strength without rousing their passions, and\r\nsapped the force of both soul and body. They were almost unanimous for a\r\nsurrender.\r\n\r\nIt was a hard struggle for the proud spirit of Hamet to bow itself to\r\nask for terms. Still, he trusted that the valor of his defence would\r\ngain him respect in the eyes of a chivalrous foe. “Ali,” said he, “has\r\nnegotiated like a merchant; I will capitulate as a soldier.” He sent a\r\nherald, therefore, to Ferdinand, offering to yield up his castle, but\r\ndemanding a separate treaty. (15)  The Castilian sovereign made a laconic\r\nand stern reply: “He shall receive no terms but such as have been\r\ngranted to the community of Malaga.”\r\n\r\nFor two days Hamet el Zegri remained brooding in his castle after the\r\ncity was in possession of the Christians; at length the clamors of his\r\nfollowers compelled him to surrender. When the remnant of this fierce\r\nAfrican garrison descended from their cragged fortress, they were so\r\nworn by watchfulness, famine, and battle, yet carried such a lurking\r\nfury in their eyes, that they looked more like fiends than men. They\r\nwere all condemned to slavery, excepting Ibrahim Zenete. The instance of\r\nclemency which he had shown in refraining to harm the Spanish striplings\r\non the last sally from Malaga won him favorable terms. It was cited as a\r\nmagnanimous act by the Spanish cavaliers, and all admitted that,\r\nthough a Moor in blood, he possessed the Christian heart of a Castilian\r\nhidalgo.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Cura de los Palacios, cap. 84.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to Hamet el Zegri, on being asked what moved him to such hardened\r\nobstinacy, he replied, “When I undertook my command, I pledged myself to\r\nfight in defence of my faith, my city, and my sovereign until slain\r\nor made prisoner; and, depend upon it, had I had men to stand by me, I\r\nshould have died fighting, instead of thus tamely surrendering myself\r\nwithout a weapon in my hand.”\r\n\r\n“Such,” says the pious Fray Antonio Agapida, “was the diabolical hatred\r\nand stiff-necked opposition of this infidel to our holy cause. But he\r\nwas justly served by our most Catholic and high-minded sovereign for his\r\npertinacious defence of the city, for Ferdinand ordered that he should\r\nbe loaded with chains and thrown into a dungeon.” He was subsequently\r\nretained in rigorous confinement at Carmona.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Pulgar, part 3, cap. 93; Pietro Martyr, lib. 1, cap. 69; Alcantara,\r\nHist. Granada, vol. 4, c. 18.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVI.\r\n\r\nHOW THE CASTILIAN SOVEREIGNS TOOK POSSESSION OF THE CITY OF MALAGA, AND\r\nHOW KING FERDINAND SIGNALIZED HIMSELF BY HIS SKILL IN BARGAINING WITH\r\nTHE INHABITANTS FOR THEIR RANSOM.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the first cares of the conquerors on entering Malaga was to\r\nsearch for Christian captives. Nearly sixteen hundred men and women were\r\nfound, and among them were persons of distinction. Some of them had been\r\nten, fifteen, and twenty years in captivity. Many had been servants to\r\nthe Moors or laborers on public works, and some had passed their time\r\nin chains and dungeons. Preparations were made to celebrate their\r\ndeliverance as a Christian triumph. A tent was erected not far from the\r\ncity, and furnished with an altar and all the solemn decorations of\r\na chapel. Here the king and queen waited to receive the Christian\r\ncaptives. They were assembled in the city and marshalled forth in\r\npiteous procession. Many of them had still the chains and shackles\r\non their legs; they were wasted with famine, their hair and beards\r\novergrown and matted, and their faces pale and haggard from long\r\nconfinement. When they found themselves restored to liberty and\r\nsurrounded by their countrymen, some stared wildly about as if in a\r\ndream, others gave way to frantic transports, but most of them wept for\r\njoy. All present were moved to tears by so touching a spectacle. When\r\nthe procession arrived at what is called the Gate of Granada, it was met\r\nby a great concourse from the camp with crosses and pennons, who turned\r\nand followed the captives, singing hymns of praise and thanksgiving.\r\nWhen they came in presence of the king and queen, they threw themselves\r\non their knees, and would have kissed their feet as their saviors and\r\ndeliverers, but the sovereigns prevented such humiliation and graciously\r\nextended to them their hands. They then prostrated themselves before\r\nthe altar, and all present joined them in giving thanks to God for their\r\nliberation from this cruel bondage. By orders of the king and queen\r\ntheir chains were then taken off, and they were clad in decent raiment\r\nand food was set before them. After they had ate and drunk, and were\r\nrefreshed and invigorated, they were provided with money and all things\r\nnecessary for their journey, and sent joyfully to their homes.\r\n\r\nWhile the old chroniclers dwell with becoming enthusiasm on this pure\r\nand affecting triumph of humanity, they go on in a strain of equal\r\neulogy to describe a spectacle of a far different nature. It so happened\r\nthat there were found in the city twelve of those renegado Christians\r\nwho had deserted to the Moors and conveyed false intelligence during\r\nthe siege: a barbarous species of punishment was inflicted upon them,\r\nborrowed, it is said, from the Moors and peculiar to these wars. They\r\nwere tied to stakes in a public place, and horsemen exercised their\r\nskill in transpiercing them with pointed reeds, hurled at them while\r\ncareering at full speed, until the miserable victims expired beneath\r\ntheir wounds. Several apostate Moors also, who, having embraced\r\nChristianity, had afterward relapsed into their early faith, and had\r\ntaken refuge in Malaga from the vengeance of the Inquisition,\r\nwere publicly burnt. “These,” says an old Jesuit historian\r\nexultingly,--“these were the tilts of reeds and the illuminations most\r\npleasing for this victorious festival and for the Catholic piety of our\r\nsovereigns.” *\r\n\r\n\r\n     * “Los renegados fuernon acanavareados: y los conversos quemados;\r\ny estos fueron las canas, y luminarias mas alegres, por la fiesta de la\r\nvitoria, para la piedad Catholica de nuestros Reyes.”--Abarca, “Anales\r\nde Aragon,” tom. 2, Rey xxx. c. 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the city was cleansed from the impurities and offensive odors\r\nwhich had collected during the siege, the bishops and other clergy who\r\naccompanied the court, and the choir of the royal chapel, walked in\r\nprocession to the principal mosque, which was consecrated and entitled\r\nSanta Maria de la Incarnacion. This done, the king and queen entered\r\nthe city, accompanied by the grand cardinal of Spain and the principal\r\nnobles and cavaliers of the army, and heard a solemn mass. The church\r\nwas then elevated into a cathedral, and Malaga was made a bishopric,\r\nand many of the neighboring towns were comprehended in its diocese. The\r\nqueen took up her residence in the Alcazaba, in the apartments of her\r\nvaliant treasurer, Ruy Lopez, whence she had a view of the whole\r\ncity, but the king established his quarters in the warrior castle of\r\nGibralfaro.\r\n\r\nAnd now came to be considered the disposition of the Moorish prisoners.\r\nAll those who were strangers in the city, and had either taken refuge\r\nthere or had entered to defend it, were at once considered slaves. They\r\nwere divided into three lots: one was set apart for the service of God\r\nin redeeming Christian captives from bondage, either in the kingdom of\r\nGranada or in Africa; the second lot was divided among those who had\r\naided either in field or cabinet in the present siege, according to\r\ntheir rank; the third was appropriated to defray by their sale the\r\ngreat expenses incurred in the reduction of the place. A hundred of the\r\nGomeres were sent as presents to Pope Innocent VIII., and were led\r\nin triumph through the streets of Rome, and afterward converted to\r\nChristianity. Fifty Moorish maidens were sent to the queen Joanna of\r\nNaples, sister to King Ferdinand, and thirty to the queen of Portugal.\r\nIsabella made presents of others to the ladies of her household and of\r\nthe noble families of Spain.\r\n\r\nAmong the inhabitants of Malaga were four hundred and fifty Moorish\r\nJews, for the most part women, speaking the Arabic language and dressed\r\nin the Moresco fashion. These were ransomed by a wealthy Jew of Castile,\r\nfarmer-general of the royal revenues derived from the Jews of Spain.\r\nHe agreed to make up within a certain time the sum of twenty thousand\r\ndoblas, or pistoles of gold, all the money and jewels of the captives\r\nbeing taken in part payment. They were sent to Castile in two armed\r\ngalleys. As to Ali Dordux, such favors and honors were heaped upon him\r\nby the Spanish sovereigns for his considerate mediation in the surrender\r\nthat the disinterestedness of his conduct has often been called in\r\nquestion. He was appointed chief justice and alcayde of the (10) mudexares\r\nor Moorish subjects, and was presented with twenty houses, one public\r\nbakery, and several orchards, vineyards, and tracts of open country. He\r\nretired to Antiquera, where he died several years afterward, leaving\r\nhis estate and name to his son, Mohamed Dordux. The latter embraced the\r\nChristian faith, as did his wife, the daughter of a Moorish noble. On\r\nbeing baptized he received the name of Don Fernando de Malaga, his\r\nwife that of Isabella, after the queen. They were incorporated with\r\nthe nobility of Castile, and their descendants still bear the name of\r\nMalaga.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Conversaciones Malaguenas, 26, as cited by Alcantara in his\r\nHistory of Granada, vol. 4, c. 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to the great mass of Moorish inhabitants, they implored that they\r\nmight not be scattered and sold into captivity, but might be permitted\r\nto ransom themselves by an amount paid within a certain time. Upon this\r\nKing Ferdinand took the advice of certain of his ablest counsellors.\r\nThey said to him: “If you hold out a prospect of hopeless captivity, the\r\ninfidels will throw all their gold and jewels into wells and pits, and\r\nyou will lose the greater part of the spoil; but if you fix a general\r\nrate of ransom, and receive their money and jewels in part payment,\r\nnothing will be destroyed.” The king relished greatly this advice,\r\nand it was arranged that all the inhabitants should be ransomed at the\r\ngeneral rate of thirty doblas or pistoles in gold for each individual,\r\nmale or female, large or small; that all their gold, jewels, and other\r\nvaluables should be received immediately in part payment of the general\r\namount, and that the residue should be paid within eight months--that\r\nif any of the number, actually living, should die in the interim, their\r\nransom should nevertheless be paid. If, however, the whole of the amount\r\nwere not paid at the expiration of the eight months, they should all be\r\nconsidered and treated as slaves.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Moors were eager to catch at the least hope of future\r\nliberty, and consented to these hard conditions. The most rigorous\r\nprecautions were taken to exact them to the uttermost. The inhabitants\r\nwere numbered by houses and families, and their names taken down;\r\ntheir most precious effects were made up into parcels, and sealed and\r\ninscribed with their names, and they were ordered to repair with them to\r\ncertain large corrales or enclosures adjoining the Alcazaba, which were\r\nsurrounded by high walls and overlooked by watch-towers, to which places\r\nthe cavalgadas of Christian captives had usually been driven to be\r\nconfined until the time of sale like cattle in a market. The Moors were\r\nobliged to leave their houses one by one: all their money, necklaces,\r\nbracelets, and anklets of gold, pearl, coral, and precious stones\r\nwere taken from them at the threshold, and their persons so rigorously\r\nsearched that they carried off nothing concealed.\r\n\r\nThen might be seen old men and helpless women and tender maidens, some\r\nof high birth and gentle condition, passing through the streets, heavily\r\nburdened, toward the Alcazaba. As they left their homes they smote their\r\nbreasts and wrung their hands, and raised their weeping eyes to heaven\r\nin anguish; and this is recorded as their plaint: “O Malaga! city so\r\nrenowned and beautiful! where now is the strength of thy castle, where\r\nthe grandeur of thy towers? Of what avail have been thy mighty walls\r\nfor the protection of thy children? Behold them driven from thy pleasant\r\nabodes, doomed to drag out a life of bondage in a foreign land, and to\r\ndie far from the home of their infancy! What will become of thy old men\r\nand matrons when their gray hairs shall be no longer reverenced? What\r\nwill become of thy maidens, so delicately reared and tenderly cherished,\r\nwhen reduced to hard and menial servitude? Behold thy once happy\r\nfamilies scattered asunder, never again to be united--sons separated\r\nfrom their fathers, husbands from their wives, and tender children from\r\ntheir mothers: they will bewail each other in foreign lands, but their\r\nlamentations will be the scoff of the stranger. O Malaga! city of our\r\nbirth! who can behold thy desolation and not shed tears of bitterness?” *\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Pulgar, Reyes Catolicos, c. 93.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Malaga was completely secured a detachment was sent against two\r\nfortresses near the sea, called Mixas and Osuna, which had frequently\r\nharassed the Christian camp. The inhabitants were threatened with the\r\nsword unless they instantly surrendered. They claimed the same terms\r\nthat had been granted to Malaga, imagining them to be freedom of person\r\nand security of property. Their claim was granted: they were transported\r\nto Malaga with all their riches, and on arriving there were overwhelmed\r\nwith consternation at finding themselves captives. “Ferdinand,” observes\r\nFray Antonio Agapida, “was a man of his word; they were shut up in the\r\nenclosure at the Alcazaba with the people of Malaga and shared their\r\nfate.”\r\n\r\nThe unhappy captives remained thus crowded in the courtyards of the\r\nAlcazaba, like sheep in a fold, until they could be sent by sea and land\r\nto Seville. They were then distributed about in city and country, each\r\nChristian family having one or more to feed and maintain as servants\r\nuntil the term fixed for the payment of the residue of the ransom should\r\nexpire. The captives had obtained permission that several of their\r\nnumber should go about among the Moorish towns of the kingdom of Granada\r\ncollecting contributions to aid in the purchase of their liberties, but\r\nthese towns were too much impoverished by the war and engrossed by their\r\nown distresses to lend a listening ear; so the time expired without the\r\nresidue of the ransom being paid, and all the captives of Malaga, to the\r\nnumber, as some say, of eleven, and others of fifteen, thousand, became\r\nslaves. “Never,” exclaims the worthy Fray Antonio Agapida in one of his\r\nusual bursts of zeal and loyalty,--“never has there been recorded a more\r\nadroit and sagacious arrangement than this made by the Catholic monarch,\r\nby which he not only secured all the property and half of the ransom\r\nof these infidels, but finally got possession of their persons into the\r\nbargain. This truly may be considered one of the greatest triumphs of\r\nthe pious and politic Ferdinand, and as raising him above the generality\r\nof conquerors, who have merely the valor to gain victories, but lack the\r\nprudence and management necessary to turn them to account.” *\r\n\r\n\r\n     * The detestable policy of Ferdinand in regard to the Moorish\r\ncaptives of Malaga is recorded at length by the curate of Los Palacios\r\n(c. 87), a contemporary, a zealous admirer of the king, and one of\r\nthe most honest of chroniclers, who really thought he was recording a\r\nnotable instance of sagacious piety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVII.\r\n\r\nHOW KING FERDINAND PREPARED TO CARRY THE WAR INTO A DIFFERENT PART OF\r\nTHE TERRITORIES OF THE MOORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe western part of the kingdom of Granada had now been conquered by\r\nthe Christian arms. The seaport of Malaga was captured; the fierce and\r\nwarlike inhabitants of Serrania de Ronda and the other mountain-holds\r\nof the frontier were all disarmed and reduced to peaceful and laborious\r\nvassalage; their haughty fortresses, which had so long overawed the\r\nvalleys of Andalusia, now displayed the standard of Castile and Aragon;\r\nthe watch-towers which crowned every height, whence the infidels had\r\nkept a vulture eye over the Christian territories, were now either\r\ndismantled or garrisoned with Catholic troops. “What signalized and\r\nsanctified this great triumph,” adds the worthy Fray Antonio Agapida,\r\n“were the emblems of ecclesiastical domination which everywhere\r\nappeared. In every direction rose stately convents and monasteries,\r\nthose fortresses of the faith garrisoned by its spiritual soldiery of\r\nmonks and friars. The sacred melody of Christian bells was again heard\r\namong the mountains, calling to early matins or sounding the Angelus at\r\nthe solemn hour of evening.” *\r\n\r\n\r\n     * The worthy curate of Los Palacios intimates in his chronicle that\r\nthis melody, so grateful to the ears of pious Christians, was a source\r\nof perpetual torment to the ears of infidels.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile this part of the kingdom was thus reduced by the Christian sword,\r\nthe central part, round the city of Granada, forming the heart of the\r\nMoorish territory, was held in vassalage of the Castilian monarch by\r\nBoabdil, surnamed El Chico. That unfortunate prince lost no occasion\r\nto propitiate the conquerors of his country by acts of homage and by\r\nprofessions that must have been foreign to his heart. No sooner had\r\nhe heard of the capture of Malaga than he sent congratulations to\r\nthe Catholic sovereigns, accompanied with presents of horses richly\r\ncaparisoned for the king, and precious cloth of gold and Oriental\r\nperfumes for the queen. His congratulations and his presents were\r\nreceived with the utmost graciousness, and the short-sighted prince,\r\nlulled by the temporary and politic forbearance of Ferdinand, flattered\r\nhimself that he was securing the lasting friendship of that monarch.\r\n\r\nThe policy of Boabdil had its transient and superficial advantages. The\r\nportion of Moorish territory under his immediate sway had a respite from\r\nthe calamities of war, the husbandmen cultivated their luxuriant fields\r\nin security, and the Vega of Granada once more blossomed like the rose.\r\nThe merchants again carried on a gainful traffic: the gates of the city\r\nwere thronged with beasts of burden, bringing the rich products of every\r\nclime. Yet, while the people of Granada rejoiced in their teeming fields\r\nand crowded marts, they secretly despised the policy which had procured\r\nthem these advantages, and held Boabdil for little better than an\r\napostate and an unbeliever. Muley Abdallah el Zagal was now the hope of\r\nthe unconquered part of the kingdom, and every Moor whose spirit was not\r\nquite subdued with his fortunes lauded the valor of the old monarch and\r\nhis fidelity to the faith, and wished success to his standard.\r\n\r\nEl Zagal, though he no longer sat enthroned in the Alhambra, yet reigned\r\nover more considerable domains than his nephew. His territories\r\nextended from the frontier of Jaen along the borders of Murcia to\r\nthe Mediterranean, and reached into the centre of the kingdom. On the\r\nnortheast he held the cities of Baza and Guadix, situated in the midst\r\nof fertile regions. He had the important seaport of Almeria also, which\r\nat one time rivalled Granada itself in wealth and population. Besides\r\nthese, his territories included a great part of the Alpuxarras\r\nmountains, which extend across the kingdom and shoot out branches toward\r\nthe sea-coast. This mountainous region was a stronghold of wealth and\r\npower. Its stern and rocky heights, rising to the clouds, seemed to set\r\ninvasion at defiance, yet within their rugged embraces were sheltered\r\ndelightful valleys of the happiest temperature and richest fertility.\r\nThe cool springs and limpid rills which gushed out in all parts of the\r\nmountains, and the abundant streams which for a great part of the year\r\nwere supplied by the Sierra Nevada, spread a perpetual verdure over the\r\nskirts and slopes of the hills, and, collecting in silver rivers in the\r\nvalleys, wound along among plantations of mulberry trees and groves\r\nof oranges and citrons, of almonds, figs, and pomegranates. Here was\r\nproduced the finest silk of Spain, which gave employment to thousands\r\nof manufacturers. The sunburnt sides of the hills also were covered with\r\nvineyards; the abundant herbage of the mountain-ravines and the rich\r\npasturage of the valleys fed vast flocks and herds; and even the arid\r\nand rocky bosoms of the heights teemed with wealth from the mines\r\nof various metals with which they were impregnated. In a word, the\r\nAlpuxarras mountains had ever been the great source of revenue to the\r\nmonarchs of Granada. Their inhabitants also were hardy and warlike,\r\nand a sudden summons from the Moorish king could at any time call forth\r\nfifty thousand fighting-men from their rocky fastnesses.\r\n\r\nSuch was the rich but rugged fragment of an empire which remained under\r\nthe sway of the old warrior-monarch El Zagal. The mountain-barriers by\r\nwhich it was locked up had protected it from most of the ravages of the\r\npresent war. El Zagal prepared himself by strengthening every fortress\r\nto battle fiercely for its maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic sovereigns saw that fresh troubles and toils awaited\r\nthem. The war had to be carried into a new quarter, demanding immense\r\nexpenditure, and new ways and means must be devised to replenish their\r\nexhausted coffers. “As this was a holy war, however,” says Fray Antonio\r\nAgapida, “and peculiarly redounded to the prosperity of the Church, the\r\nclergy were full of zeal, and contributed vast sums of money and large\r\nbodies of troops. A pious fund was also produced from the first fruits\r\nof that glorious institution, the Inquisition.”\r\n\r\nIt so happened that about this time there were many families of wealth\r\nand dignity in the kingdoms of Aragon and Valencia and the principality\r\nof Catalonia whose forefathers had been Jews, but had been converted to\r\nChristianity. Notwithstanding the outward piety of these families, it\r\nwas surmised, and soon came to be strongly suspected, that many of then\r\nhad a secret hankering after Judaism, and it was even whispered that\r\nsome of them practised Jewish rites in private.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic monarch (continues Agapida) had a righteous abhorrence\r\nof all kinds of heresy and a fervent zeal for the faith; he\r\nordered, therefore, a strict investigation of the conduct of these\r\npseudo-Christians. Inquisitors were sent into the provinces for the\r\npurpose, who proceeded with their accustomed zeal. The consequence was,\r\nthat many families were convicted of apostasy from the Christian faith\r\nand of the private practice of Judaism. Some, who had grace and policy\r\nsufficient to reform in time, were again received into the Christian\r\nfold after being severely mulcted and condemned to heavy penance; others\r\nwere burnt at “auto de fes” for the edification of the public, and their\r\nproperty was confiscated for the good of the state.\r\n\r\nAs these Hebrews were of great wealth and had an hereditary passion for\r\njewelry, there was found abundant store in their possession of gold\r\nand silver, of rings and necklaces, and strings of pearl and coral,\r\nand precious stones--treasures easy of transportation and wonderfully\r\nadapted for the emergencies of war. “In this way,” concludes the\r\npious Agapida, “these backsliders, by the all-seeing contrivances of\r\nProvidence, were made to serve the righteous cause which they had so\r\ntreacherously deserted; and their apostate wealth was sanctified by\r\nbeing devoted to the service of Heaven and the Crown in this holy\r\ncrusade against the infidels.”\r\n\r\nIt must be added, however, that these pious financial expedients\r\nreceived some check from the interference of Queen Isabella. Her\r\npenetrating eyes discovered that many enormities had been committed\r\nunder color of religious zeal, and many innocent persons accused\r\nby false witnesses of apostasy, either through malice or a hope of\r\nobtaining their wealth: she caused strict investigation, therefore, into\r\nthe proceedings which had been held, many of which were reversed, and\r\nsuborners punished in proportion to their guilt.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Pulgar, part 3, c. 100.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVIII.\r\n\r\nHOW KING FERDINAND INVADED THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE KINGDOM OF GRANADA,\r\nAND HOW HE WAS RECEIVED BY EL ZAGAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Muley Abdallah el Zagal,” says the venerable Jesuit father Pedro\r\nAbarca, “was the most venomous Mahometan in all Morisma;” and the worthy\r\nFray Antonio Agapida most devoutly echoes his opinion. “Certainly,”\r\n adds the latter, “none ever opposed a more heathenish and diabolical\r\nobstinacy to the holy inroads of the cross and sword.”\r\n\r\nEl Zagal felt that it was necessary to do something to quicken his\r\npopularity with the people, and that nothing was more effectual than a\r\nsuccessful inroad. The Moors loved the stirring call to arms and a wild\r\nforay among the mountains, and delighted more in a hasty spoil, wrested\r\nwith hard fighting from the Christians, than in all the steady and\r\ncertain gains secured by peaceful traffic.\r\n\r\nThere reigned at this time a careless security along the frontier of\r\nJaen. The alcaydes of the Christian fortresses were confident of the\r\nfriendship of Boabdil el Chico, and they fancied his uncle too distant\r\nand too much engrossed by his own perplexities to think of molesting\r\nthem. On a sudden El Zagal issued out of Guadix with a chosen band,\r\npassed rapidly through the mountains which extend behind Granada, and\r\nfell like a thunderbolt upon the territories in the neighborhood of\r\nAlcala la Real. Before the alarm could be spread and the frontier roused\r\nhe had made a wide career of destruction through the country, sacking\r\nand burning villages, sweeping off flocks and herds, and carrying away\r\ncaptives. The warriors of the frontier assembled, but El Zagal was\r\nalready far on his return through the mountains, and he re-entered the\r\ngates of Guadix in triumph, his army laden with Christian spoil and\r\nconducting an immense cavalgada. Such was one of El Zagal’s preparatives\r\nfor the expected invasion of the Christian king, exciting the warlike\r\nspirit of his people, and gaining for himself a transient popularity.\r\n\r\nKing Ferdinand assembled his army at Murcia in the spring of 1488. He\r\nleft that city on the fifth of June with a flying camp of four thousand\r\nhorse and fourteen thousand foot. The marques of Cadiz led the van,\r\nfollowed by the adelantado of Murcia. The army entered the Moorish\r\nfrontier by the sea-coast, spreading terror through the land: wherever\r\nit appeared, the towns surrendered without a blow, so great was\r\nthe dread of experiencing the woes which had desolated the opposite\r\nfrontier. In this way Vera, Velez el Rubio, Velez el Blanco, and many\r\ntowns of inferior note to the number of sixty yielded at the first\r\nsummons.\r\n\r\nIt was not until it approached Almeria that the army met with\r\nresistance. This important city was commanded by the prince Zelim, a\r\nrelation of El Zagal. He led forth his Moors bravely to the encounter,\r\nand skirmished fiercely with the advance guard in the gardens near the\r\ncity. King Ferdinand came up with the main body of the army and called\r\noff his troops from the skirmish. He saw that to attack the place with\r\nhis present force was fruitless. Having reconnoitred the city and its\r\nenvirons, therefore, against a future campaign, he retired with his army\r\nand marched toward Baza.\r\n\r\nThe old warrior El Zagal was himself drawn up in the city of Baza with a\r\npowerful garrison. He felt confidence in the strength of the place, and\r\nrejoiced when he heard that the Christian king was approaching. In the\r\nvalley in front of Baza there extended a great tract of gardens, like\r\na continued grove, intersected by canals and water courses. In this he\r\nstationed an ambuscade of arquebusiers and crossbowmen. The vanguard of\r\nthe Christian army came marching gayly up the valley with great sound of\r\ndrum and trumpet, and led on by the marques of Cadiz and the adelantado\r\nof Murcia. As they drew near El Zagal sallied forth with horse and foot\r\nand attacked them for a time with great spirit. Gradually falling back,\r\nas if pressed by their superior valor, he drew the exulting Christians\r\namong the gardens. Suddenly the Moors in ambuscade burst from their\r\nconcealment, and opened such a fire in flank and rear that many of the\r\nChristians were slain and the rest thrown into confusion. King Ferdinand\r\narrived in time to see the disastrous situation of his troops, and gave\r\nsignal for the vanguard to retire.\r\n\r\nEl Zagal did not permit the foe to draw off unmolested. Ordering out\r\nfresh squadrons, he fell upon the rear of the retreating troops with\r\ntriumphant shouts, driving them before him with dreadful havoc. The\r\nold war-cry of “El Zagal! El Zagal!” was again put up by the Moors, and\r\nechoed with transport from the walls of the city. The Christians were in\r\nimminent peril of a complete rout, when, fortunately, the adelantado\r\nof Murcia threw himself with a large body of horse and foot between the\r\npursuers and the pursued, covering the retreat of the latter and giving\r\nthem time to rally. The Moors were now attacked so vigorously in turn\r\nthat they gave over the contest and drew back slowly into the city. Many\r\nvaliant cavaliers were slain in this skirmish; among the number was Don\r\nPhilip of Aragon, master of the chivalry of St. George of Montesor: he\r\nwas illegitimate son of the king’s illegitimate brother Don Carlos,\r\nand his death was greatly bewailed by Ferdinand. He had formerly been\r\narchbishop of Palermo, but had doffed the cassock for the cuirass,\r\nand, according to Fray Antonio Agapida, had gained a glorious crown of\r\nmartyrdom by falling in this holy war.\r\n\r\nThe warm reception of his advance guard brought King Ferdinand to a\r\npause: he encamped on the banks of the neighboring river Guadalquiton,\r\nand began to consider whether he had acted wisely in undertaking\r\nthis campaign with his present force. His late successes had probably\r\nrendered him over-confident: El Zagal had again schooled him into his\r\ncharacteristic caution. He saw that the old warrior was too formidably\r\nensconced in Baza to be dislodged by anything except a powerful army\r\nand battering artillery, and he feared that should he persist in his\r\ninvasion some disaster might befall his army, either from the enterprise\r\nof the foe or from a pestilence which prevailed in various parts of the\r\ncountry. He retired, therefore, from before Baza, as he had on a former\r\noccasion from before Loxa, all the wiser for a wholesome lesson in\r\nwarfare, but by no means grateful to those who had given it, and with a\r\nsolemn determination to have his revenge upon his teachers.\r\n\r\nHe now took measures for the security of the places gained in the\r\ncampaign, placing in them strong garrisons, well armed and supplied,\r\ncharging their alcaydes to be vigilant on their posts and to give no\r\nrest to the enemy. The whole of the frontier was under the command\r\nof Luis Fernandez Puerto Carrero. As it was evident from the warlike\r\ncharacter of El Zagal that there would be abundance of active service\r\nand hard fighting, many hidalgos and young cavaliers eager for\r\ndistinction remained with Puerto Carrero.\r\n\r\nAll these dispositions being made, King Ferdinand closed the dubious\r\ncampaign of this year, not, as usual, by returning in triumph at\r\nthe head of his army to some important city of his dominions, but by\r\ndisbanding the troops and repairing to pray at the cross of Caravaca.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIX.\r\n\r\nHOW THE MOORS MADE VARIOUS ENTERPRISES AGAINST THE CHRISTIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\n“While the pious king Ferdinand,” observes Fray Antonio Agapida,\r\n“was humbling himself before the cross and devoutly praying for the\r\ndestruction of his enemies, that fierce pagan, El Zagal, depending\r\nmerely on arm of flesh and sword of steel, pursued his diabolical\r\noutrages upon the Christians.” No sooner was the invading army disbanded\r\nthan he sallied forth from his stronghold, and carried fire and sword\r\ninto all those parts which had submitted to the Spanish yoke. The\r\ncastle of Nixar, being carelessly guarded, was taken by surprise and its\r\ngarrison put to the sword. The old warrior raged with sanguinary fury\r\nabout the whole frontier, attacking convoys, slaying, wounding, and\r\nmaking prisoners, and coming by surprise upon the Christians wherever\r\nthey were off their guard.\r\n\r\nCarlos de Biedma, alcayde of the fortress of Culla, confiding in the\r\nstrength of its walls and towers and in its difficult situation, being\r\nbuilt on the summit of a lofty hill and surrounded by precipices,\r\nventured to absent himself from his post. He was engaged to be married\r\nto a fair and noble lady of Baeza, and repaired to that city to\r\ncelebrate his nuptials, escorted by a brilliant array of the best\r\nhorsemen of his garrison. Apprised of his absence, the vigilant El Zagal\r\nsuddenly appeared before Culla with a powerful force, stormed the town\r\nsword in hand, fought the Christians from street to street, and drove\r\nthem with great slaughter to the citadel. Here a veteran captain, by the\r\nname of Juan de Avalos, a gray-headed warrior scarred in many a battle,\r\nassumed the command and made an obstinate defence. Neither the multitude\r\nof the enemy nor the vehemence of their attacks, though led on by the\r\nterrible El Zagal himself, had power to shake the fortitude of this\r\ndoughty old soldier.\r\n\r\nThe Moors undermined the outer walls and one of the towers of the\r\nfortress, and made their way into the exterior court. The alcayde manned\r\nthe tops of his towers, pouring down melted pitch and showering darts,\r\narrows, stones, and all kinds of missiles upon the assailants. The Moors\r\nwere driven out of the court, but, being reinforced with fresh troops,\r\nreturned repeatedly to the assault. For five days the combat was kept\r\nup: the Christians were nearly exhausted, but were sustained by the\r\ncheerings of their stanch old alcayde and the fear of death from El\r\nZagal should they surrender. At length the approach of a powerful force\r\nunder Don Luis Puerto Carrero relieved them from this fearful peril. El\r\nZagal abandoned the assault, but set fire to the town in his rage and\r\ndisappointment, and retired to his stronghold of Guadix.\r\n\r\nThe example of El Zagal roused his adherents to action. Two bold Moorish\r\nalcaydes, Ali Aliatar and Yzan Aliatar, commanding the fortresses\r\nof Alhenden and Salobrena, laid waste the country of the subjects of\r\nBoabdil and the places which had recently submitted to the Christians:\r\nthey swept off the cattle, carried off captives, and harassed the whole\r\nof the newly-conquered frontier.\r\n\r\nThe Moors also of Almeria and Tavernas and Purchena made inroads into\r\nMurcia, and carried fire and sword into its most fertile regions. On the\r\nopposite frontier also, among the wild valleys and rugged recesses of\r\nthe Sierra Bermeja, or Red Mountains, many of the Moors who had lately\r\nsubmitted again flew to arms. The marques of Cadiz suppressed by timely\r\nvigilance the rebellion of the mountain-town of Gausin, situated on a\r\nhigh peak almost among the clouds; but others of the Moors fortified\r\nthemselves in rock-built towers and castles, inhabited solely by\r\nwarriors, whence they carried on a continual war of forage and\r\ndepredation, sweeping down into the valleys and carrying off flocks\r\nand herds and all kinds of booty to these eagle-nests, to which it was\r\nperilous and fruitless to pursue them.\r\n\r\nThe worthy Fray Antonio Agapida closes his history of this checkered\r\nyear in quite a different strain from those triumphant periods with\r\nwhich he is accustomed to wind up the victorious campaigns of the\r\nsovereigns. “Great and mighty,” says this venerable chronicler, “were\r\nthe floods and tempests which prevailed throughout the kingdoms of\r\nCastile and Aragon about this time. It seemed as though the windows of\r\nheaven were again opened and a second deluge overwhelming the face\r\nof nature. The clouds burst as it were in cataracts upon the earth;\r\ntorrents rushed down from the mountains, overflowing the valleys; brooks\r\nwere swelled into raging rivers; houses were undermined; mills were\r\nswept away by their own streams; the affrighted shepherds saw their\r\nflocks drowned in the midst of the pasture, and were fain to take refuge\r\nfor their lives in towers and high places. The Guadalquivir for a time\r\nbecame a roaring and tumultuous sea, inundating the immense plain of the\r\nTablada and filling the fair city of Seville with affright.\r\n\r\n“A vast black cloud moved over the land, accompanied by a hurricane\r\nand a trembling of the earth. Houses were unroofed, the walls and\r\nbattlements of fortresses shaken, and lofty towers rocked to their\r\nfoundations. Ships riding at anchor were either stranded or swallowed\r\nup; others, under sail, were tossed to and fro upon mountain waves\r\nand cast upon the land, where the whirlwind rent them in pieces and\r\nscattered them in fragments in the air. Doleful was the ruin and great\r\nthe terror where this baleful cloud passed by, and it left a long\r\ntrack of desolation over sea and land. Some of the faint-hearted,”\r\n adds Antonio Agapida, “looked upon this torment of the elements as a\r\nprodigious event, out of the course of nature. In the weakness of their\r\nfears they connected it with those troubles which occurred in various\r\nplaces, considering it a portent of some great calamity about to be\r\nwrought by the violence of the bloody-handed El Zagal and his fierce\r\nadherents.” *\r\n\r\n\r\n     * See Cura de los Palacios, cap. 91; Palencia, De Bello Granad.,\r\nlib. 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXX.\r\n\r\nHOW KING FERDINAND PREPARED TO BESIEGE THE CITY OF BAZA, AND HOW THE\r\nCITY PREPARED FOR DEFENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stormy winter had passed away, and the spring of 1489 was advancing,\r\nyet the heavy rains had broken up the roads, the mountain-brooks were\r\nswollen to raging torrents, and the late shallow and peaceful rivers\r\nwere deep, turbulent, and dangerous. The Christian troops had been\r\nsummoned to assemble in early spring on the frontiers of Jaen, but were\r\nslow in arriving at the appointed place. They were entangled in the\r\nmiry defiles of the mountains or fretted impatiently on the banks of\r\nimpassable floods. It was late in the month of May before they assembled\r\nin sufficient force to attempt the proposed invasion, when at length a\r\nvaliant army of thirteen thousand horse and forty thousand foot marched\r\nmerrily over the border. The queen remained at the city of Jaen with the\r\nprince-royal and the princesses her children, accompanied and supported\r\nby the venerable cardinal of Spain and those reverend prelates who\r\nassisted in her councils throughout this holy war.\r\n\r\nThe plan of King Ferdinand was to lay siege to the city of Baza, the key\r\nof the remaining possessions of the Moor. That important fortress taken,\r\nGuadix and Almeria must soon follow, and then the power of El Zagal\r\nwould be at an end. As the Catholic king advanced he had first to secure\r\nvarious castles and strongholds in the vicinity of Baza which might\r\notherwise harass his army. Some of these made obstinate resistance,\r\nespecially the town of Zujar. The Christians assailed the walls with\r\nvarious machines to sap them and batter them down. The brave alcayde,\r\nHubec Abdilbar, opposed force to force and engine to engine. He manned\r\nhis towers with his bravest warriors, who rained down an iron shower\r\nupon the enemy, and he linked caldrons together by strong chains and\r\ncast fire from them, consuming the wooden engines of their assailants\r\nand those who managed them.\r\n\r\nThe siege was protracted for several days: the bravery of the alcayde\r\ncould not save his fortress from an overwhelming foe, but it gained him\r\nhonorable terms. Ferdinand permitted the garrison and the inhabitants to\r\nrepair with their effects to Baza, and the valiant Hubec marched forth\r\nwith the remnant of his force and took he way to that devoted city.\r\n\r\nThe delays caused to the invading army by these various circumstances\r\nhad been diligently improved by El Zagal, who felt that he was now\r\nmaking his last stand for empire, and that this campaign would decide\r\nwhether he should continue a king or sink into a vassal. He was but a\r\nfew leagues from Baza, at the city of Guadix. This last was the most\r\nimportant point of his remaining territories, being a kind of bulwark\r\nbetween them and the hostile city of Granada, the seat of his nephew’s\r\npower. Though he heard of the tide of war, therefore, collecting and\r\nrolling toward the city of Baza, he dared not go in person to its\r\nassistance. He dreaded that should he leave Guadix, Boabdil would attack\r\nhim in the rear while the Christian army was battling with him in front.\r\nEl Zagal trusted in the great strength of Baza to defy any violent\r\nassault, and profited by the delays of the Christian army to supply it\r\nwith all possible means of defence. He sent thither all the troops\r\nhe could spare from his garrison of Guadix, and despatched missives\r\nthroughout his territories calling upon all true Moslems to hasten\r\nto Baza and make a devoted stand in defence of their homes, their\r\nliberties, and their religion. The cities of Tavernas and Purchena and\r\nthe surrounding heights and valleys responded to his orders and sent\r\nforth their fighting-men to the field. The rocky fastnesses of the\r\nAlpuxarras resounded with the din of arms: troops of horse and bodies\r\nof foot-soldiers were seen winding down the rugged cliffs and defiles of\r\nthose marble mountains and hastening toward Baza. Many brave cavaliers\r\nof Granada also, spurning the quiet and security of Christian vassalage,\r\nsecretly left the city and hastened to join their fighting countrymen.\r\nThe great dependence of El Zagal, however, was upon the valor and\r\nloyalty of his cousin and brother-in-law, Cid Hiaya Alnagar,* who was\r\nalcayde of Almeria--a cavalier experienced in warfare and redoubtable in\r\nthe field. He wrote to him to leave Almeria and repair with all speed at\r\nthe head of his troops to Baza. Cid Hiaya departed immediately with ten\r\nthousand of the bravest Moors in the kingdom. These were for the most\r\npart hardy mountaineers, tempered to sun and storm and tried in many a\r\ncombat. None equalled them for a sally or a skirmish. They were adroit\r\nin executing a thousand stratagems, ambuscadoes, and evolutions.\r\nImpetuous in their assaults, yet governed in their utmost fury by a word\r\nor sign from their commander, at the sound of a trumpet they would check\r\nthemselves in the midst of their career, wheel off and disperse, and at\r\nanother sound of a trumpet they would as suddenly reassemble and return\r\nto the attack. They were upon the enemy when least expected, coming like\r\na rushing blast, spreading havoc and consternation, and then passing\r\naway in an instant; so that when one recovered from the shock and looked\r\naround, behold, nothing was to be seen or heard of this tempest of war\r\nbut a cloud of dust and the clatter of retreating hoofs.**\r\n\r\n\r\n     * This name has generally been written Cidi Yahye.  The present mode\r\nis adopted on the authority of Alcantara in his History of Granada,\r\nwho appears to have derived it from Arabic manuscripts existing in the\r\narchives of the marques de Corvera, descendant of Cid Hiaya. The latter\r\n(Cid Hiaya) was son of Aben Zelim, a deceased prince of Almeria, and was\r\na lineal descendant from the celebrated Aben Hud, surnamed the Just. The\r\nwife of Cid Hiaya was sister of the two Moorish generals, Abul Cacim and\r\nReduan Vanegas, and, like them, the fruit of the union of a Christian\r\nknight, Don Pedro Vanegas, with Cetimerien, a Moorish princess.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * *Pulgar, part 3, c. 106.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Cid Hiaya led his train of ten thousand valiant warriors into\r\nthe gates of Baza, the city rang with acclamations and for a time the\r\ninhabitants thought themselves secure. El Zagal also felt a glow of\r\nconfidence, notwithstanding his own absence from the city. “Cid Hiaya,”\r\n said he, “is my cousin and my brother-in-law; related to me by blood and\r\nmarriage, he is a second self: happy is that monarch who has his kindred\r\nto command his armies.”\r\n\r\nWith all these reinforcements the garrison of Baza amounted to above\r\ntwenty thousand men. There were at this time three principal leaders in\r\nthe city: Mohammed Ibn Hassan, surnamed the Veteran, who was military\r\ngovernor or alcayde, an old Moor of great experience and discretion; the\r\nsecond was Hamet Abu Zali, who was captain of the troops stationed in\r\nthe place; and the third was Hubec Abdilbar, late alcayde of Zujar, who\r\nhad repaired hither with the remains of his garrison. Over all these\r\nCid Hiaya exercised a supreme command in consequence of his being of the\r\nblood-royal and in the especial confidence of Muley Abdallah el Zagal.\r\nHe was eloquent and ardent in council, and fond of striking and splendid\r\nachievements, but he was a little prone to be carried away by the\r\nexcitement of the moment and the warmth of his imagination. The councils\r\nof war of these commanders, therefore, were more frequently controlled\r\nby the opinions of the old alcayde Mohammed Ibn Hassan, for whose\r\nshrewdness, caution, and experience Cid Hiaya himself felt the greatest\r\ndeference.\r\n\r\nThe city of Baza was situated in a great valley, eight leagues in\r\nlength and three in breadth, called the Hoya, or Basin, of Baza. It was\r\nsurrounded by a range of mountains called the Sierra of Xabalcohol, the\r\nstreams of which, collecting themselves into two rivers, watered and\r\nfertilized the country. The city was built in the plain, one part of\r\nit protected by the rocky precipices of the mountain and by a powerful\r\ncitadel, the other by massive walls studded with immense towers. It\r\nhad suburbs toward the plain imperfectly fortified by earthen walls. In\r\nfront of these suburbs extended a tract of orchards and gardens nearly a\r\nleague in length, so thickly planted as to resemble a continued forest.\r\nHere every citizen who could afford it had his little plantation and\r\nhis garden of fruits and flowers and vegetables, watered by canals and\r\nrivulets and dominated by a small tower for recreation or defence. This\r\nwilderness of groves and gardens, intersected in all parts by canals and\r\nruns of water, and studded by above a thousand small towers, formed\r\na kind of protection to this side of the city, rendering all approach\r\nextremely difficult and perplexed.\r\n\r\nWhile the Christian army had been detained before the frontier\r\nposts, the city of Baza had been a scene of hurried and unremitting\r\npreparation. All the grain of the surrounding valley, though yet unripe,\r\nwas hastily reaped and borne into the city to prevent it from yielding\r\nsustenance to the enemy. The country was drained of all its supplies;\r\nflocks and herds were driven, bleating and bellowing, into the gates:\r\nlong trains of beasts of burden, some laden with food, others with\r\nlances, darts, and arms of all kinds, kept pouring into the place.\r\nAlready were munitions collected sufficient for a siege of fifteen\r\nmonths: still, the eager and hasty preparation was going on when the\r\narmy of Ferdinand came in sight.\r\n\r\nOn one side might be seen scattered parties of foot and horse spurring\r\nto the gates, and muleteers hurrying forward their burdened animals, all\r\nanxious to get under shelter before the gathering storm; on the other\r\nside, the cloud of war came sweeping down the valley, the roll of drum\r\nor clang of trumpet resounding occasionally from its deep bosom, or\r\nthe bright glance of arms flashing forth like vivid lightning from its\r\ncolumns. King Ferdinand pitched his tents in the valley beyond the\r\ngreen labyrinth of gardens. He sent his heralds to summon the city\r\nto surrender, promising the most favorable terms in case of immediate\r\ncompliance, and avowing in the most solemn terms his resolution never to\r\nabandon the siege until he had possession of the place.\r\n\r\nUpon receiving this summons the Moorish commanders held a council of\r\nwar. The prince Cid Hiaya, indignant at the menaces of the king, was for\r\nretorting by a declaration that the garrison never would surrender, but\r\nwould fight until buried under the ruins of the walls. “Of what avail,”\r\n said the veteran Mohammed, “is a declaration of the kind, which we may\r\nfalsify by our deeds? Let us threaten what we know we can perform, and\r\nlet us endeavor to perform more than we threaten.”\r\n\r\nIn conformity to his advice, therefore, a laconic reply was sent to the\r\nChristian monarch, thanking him for his offer of favorable terms,\r\nbut informing him that they were placed in the city to defend, not to\r\nsurrender it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXI.\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF THE GARDENS BEFORE BAZA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the reply of the Moorish commanders was brought to King Ferdinand,\r\nhe prepared to press the siege with the utmost vigor. Finding the\r\ncamp too far from the city, and that the intervening orchards afforded\r\nshelter for the sallies of the Moors, he determined to advance it\r\nbeyond the gardens, in the space between them and the suburbs, where\r\nhis batteries would have full play upon the city walls. A detachment was\r\nsent in advance to take possession of the gardens and keep a check upon\r\nthe suburbs, opposing any sally while the encampment should be formed\r\nand fortified. The various commanders entered the orchards at different\r\npoints. The young cavaliers marched fearlessly forward, but the\r\nexperienced veterans foresaw infinite peril in the mazes of this verdant\r\nlabyrinth. The master of St. Jago, as he led his troops into the centre\r\nof the gardens, exhorted them to keep by one another, and to press\r\nforward in defiance of all difficulty or danger, assuring them that\r\nGod would give them the victory if they attacked hardily and persisted\r\nresolutely.\r\n\r\nScarce had they entered the verge of the orchards when a din of drums\r\nand trumpets, mingled with war-cries, was heard from the suburbs, and a\r\nlegion of Moorish warriors on foot poured forth. They were led on by\r\nthe prince Cid Hiaya. He saw the imminent danger of the city should the\r\nChristians gain possession of the orchards. “Soldiers,” he cried,\r\n“we fight for life and liberty, for our families, our country, our\r\nreligion;* nothing is left for us to depend upon but the strength of our\r\nhands, the courage of our hearts, and the almighty protection of Allah.”\r\n The Moors answered him with shouts of war and rushed to the encounter.\r\nThe two hosts met in the midst of the gardens. A chance-medley combat\r\nensued with lances, arquebuses, crossbows, and scimetars; the perplexed\r\nnature of the ground, cut up and intersected by canals and streams, the\r\ncloseness of the trees, the multiplicity of towers and petty edifices,\r\ngave greater advantages to the Moors, who were on foot, than to the\r\nChristians, who were on horseback. The Moors, too, knew the ground,\r\nwith all its alleys and passes, and were thus enabled to lurk, to sally\r\nforth, attack, and retreat almost without injury.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * “Illi (Mauri) pro fortunis, pro libertate, pro laribus patriis, pro\r\nvita denique certabant.”--Pietro Martyr, “Epist. 70.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Christian commanders, seeing this, ordered many of the horsemen to\r\ndismount and fight on foot. The battle then became fierce and deadly,\r\neach disregarding his own life, provided he could slay his enemy. It was\r\nnot so much a general battle as a multitude of petty actions, for every\r\norchard and garden had its distinct contest. No one could see farther\r\nthan the little scene of fury and bloodshed around him, nor know how the\r\ngeneral battle fared. In vain the captains exerted their voices, in vain\r\nthe trumpets brayed forth signals and commands: all was confounded and\r\nunheard in the universal din and uproar. No one kept to his standard,\r\nbut fought as his own fury or fear dictated. In some places the\r\nChristians had the advantage, in others the Moors; often a victorious\r\nparty, pursuing the vanquished, came upon a superior and triumphant\r\nforce of the enemy, and the fugitives turned back upon them in an\r\noverwhelming wave. Some broken remnants, in their terror and confusion,\r\nfled from their own countrymen and sought refuge among their enemies,\r\nnot knowing friend from foe in the obscurity of the groves. The Moors\r\nwere more adroit in these wild skirmishings from their flexibility,\r\nlightness, and agility, and the rapidity with which they would disperse,\r\nrally, and return again to the charge.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Mariana, lib. 25, cap. 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hardest fighting was about the small garden-towers and pavilions,\r\nwhich served as so many petty fortresses. Each party by turns gained\r\nthem, defended them fiercely, and were driven out; many of the towers\r\nwere set on fire, and increased the horrors of the fight by the wreaths\r\nof smoke and flame in which they wrapped the groves and by the shrieks\r\nof those who were burning.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the Christian cavaliers, bewildered by the uproar and\r\nconfusion and shocked at the carnage which prevailed, would have led\r\ntheir men out of the action, but they were entangled in a labyrinth and\r\nknew not which way to retreat. While in this perplexity Juan Perea, the\r\nstandard-bearer of one of the squadrons of the grand cardinal, had his\r\narm carried off by a cannon-ball; the standard was wellnigh falling\r\ninto the hands of the enemy, when Rodrigo de Mendoza, an intrepid youth,\r\nnatural son of the grand cardinal, rushed to its rescue through a shower\r\nof balls, lances, and arrows, and, bearing it aloft, dashed forward with\r\nit into the hottest of the combat, followed by his shouting soldiery.\r\n\r\nKing Ferdinand, who remained in the skirts of the orchard, was in\r\nextreme anxiety. It was impossible to see much of the action for the\r\nmultiplicity of trees and towers and the wreaths of smoke, and those\r\nwho were driven out defeated or came out wounded and exhausted gave\r\ndifferent accounts, according to the fate of the partial conflicts in\r\nwhich they had been engaged. Ferdinand exerted himself to the utmost\r\nto animate and encourage his troops to this blind encounter, sending\r\nreinforcements of horse and foot to those points where the battle was\r\nmost sanguinary and doubtful.\r\n\r\nAmong those who were brought forth mortally wounded was Don Juan de\r\nLuna, a youth of uncommon merit, greatly prized by the king, beloved by\r\nthe army, and recently married to Dona Catalina de Urrea, a young lady\r\nof distinguished beauty.* They laid him at the foot of a tree, and\r\nendeavored to stanch and bind up his wounds with a scarf which his bride\r\nhad wrought for him; but his life-blood flowed too profusely, and while\r\na holy friar was yet administering to him the last sacred offices of the\r\nChurch, he expired, almost at the feet of his sovereign.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Mariana, P. Martyr, Zurita.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the veteran alcayde Mohammed Ibn Hassan, surrounded\r\nby a little band of chieftains, kept an anxious eye upon the scene of\r\ncombat from the walls of the city. For nearly twelve hours the battle\r\nraged without intermission. The thickness of the foliage hid all the\r\nparticulars from their sight, but they could see the flash of swords\r\nand glance of helmets among the trees. Columns of smoke rose in every\r\ndirection, while the clash of arms, the thundering of ribadoquines and\r\narquebuses, the shouts and cries of the combatants, and the groans and\r\nsupplications of the wounded bespoke the deadly conflict waging in\r\nthe bosom of the groves. They were harassed, too, by the shrieks\r\nand lamentations of the Moorish women and children as their wounded\r\nrelatives were brought bleeding from the scene of action, and were\r\nstunned by a general outcry of woe on the part of the inhabitants as the\r\nbody of Reduan Zafarjal, a renegado Christian and one of the bravest of\r\ntheir generals, was borne breathless into the city.\r\n\r\nAt length the din of battle approached nearer to the skirts of the\r\norchards. They beheld their warriors driven out from among the groves\r\nby fresh squadrons of the enemy, and, after disputing the ground inch by\r\ninch, obliged to retire to a place between the orchards and the suburbs\r\nwhich was fortified with palisadoes.\r\n\r\nThe Christians immediately planted opposing palisadoes, and established\r\nstrong outposts near to the retreat of the Moors, while at the same time\r\nKing Ferdinand ordered that his encampment should be pitched within the\r\nhard-won orchards.\r\n\r\nMohammed Ibn Hassan sallied forth to the aid of the prince Cid Hiaya,\r\nand made a desperate attempt to dislodge the enemy from this formidable\r\nposition, but the night had closed, and the darkness rendered it\r\nimpossible to make any impression. The Moors, however, kept up constant\r\nassaults and alarms throughout the night, and the weary Christians,\r\nexhausted by the toils and sufferings of the day, were not allowed a\r\nmoment of repose.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Pulgar, part 3, cap. 106, 107; Cura de los Palacios, cap. 92;\r\nZurita, lib. 20, cap 31.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXII.\r\n\r\nSIEGE OF BAZA.--EMBARRASSMENTS OF THE ARMY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe morning sun rose upon a piteous scene before the walls of Baza.\r\nThe Christian outposts, harassed throughout the night, were pale and\r\nhaggard, while the multitudes of slain which lay before their palisadoes\r\nshowed the fierce attacks they had sustained and the bravery of their\r\ndefence.\r\n\r\nBeyond them lay the groves and gardens of Baza, once favorite resorts\r\nfor recreation and delight, now a scene of horror and desolation. The\r\ntowers and pavilions were smoking ruins; the canals and water-courses\r\nwere discolored with blood and choked with the bodies of the slain. Here\r\nand there the ground, deep dinted with the tramp of man and steed and\r\nplashed and slippery with gore, showed where had been some fierce and\r\nmortal conflict, while the bodies of Moors and Christians, ghastly\r\nin death, lay half concealed among the matted and trampled shrubs and\r\nflowers and herbage.\r\n\r\nAmidst these sanguinary scenes rose the Christian tents, hastily pitched\r\namong the gardens in the preceding evening. The experience of the night,\r\nhowever, and the forlorn aspect of everything in the morning convinced\r\nKing Ferdinand of the perils and hardships to which his camp must be\r\nexposed in its present situation, and after a consultation with his\r\nprincipal cavaliers he resolved to abandon the orchards.\r\n\r\nIt was a dangerous movement, to extricate his army from so entangled a\r\nsituation in the face of so alert and daring an enemy. A bold front was\r\ntherefore kept up toward the city; additional troops were ordered to the\r\nadvanced posts, and works begun as if for a settled encampment. Not a\r\ntent was struck in the gardens, but in the mean time the most active and\r\nunremitting exertions were made to remove all the baggage and furniture\r\nof the camp back to the original station.\r\n\r\nAll day the Moors beheld a formidable show of war maintained in front of\r\nthe gardens, while in the rear the tops of the Christian tents and the\r\npennons of the different commanders were seen rising above the groves.\r\nSuddenly, toward evening the tents sank and disappeared, the outposts\r\nbroke up their stations and withdrew, and the whole shadow of an\r\nencampment was fast vanishing from their eyes.\r\n\r\nThe Moors saw too late the subtle manoeuvre of King Ferdinand. Cid Hiaya\r\nagain sallied forth with a large force of horse and foot, and pressed\r\nfuriously upon the Christians. The latter; however, experienced in\r\nMoorish attack, retired in close order, sometimes turning upon the enemy\r\nand driving them to their barricadoes, and then pursuing their retreat.\r\nIn this way the army was extricated without much further loss from the\r\nperilous labyrinths of the gardens.\r\n\r\nThe camp was now out of danger, but it was also too distant from the\r\ncity to do mischief, while the Moors could sally forth and return\r\nwithout hindrance. The king called a council of war to consider in what\r\nmanner to proceed. The marques of Cadiz was for abandoning the siege\r\nfor the present, the place being too strong, too well garrisoned and\r\nprovided, and too extensive for their limited forces either to carry it\r\nby assault or invest and reduce it by famine, while in lingering before\r\nit the army would be exposed to the usual maladies and sufferings of\r\nbesieging armies, and when the rainy season came on would be shut up\r\nby the swelling of the rivers. He recommended, instead, that the king\r\nshould throw garrisons of horse and foot into all the towns captured in\r\nthe neighborhood, and leave them to keep up a predatory war upon Baza,\r\nwhile he should overrun and ravage all the country, so that in the\r\nfollowing year Almeria and Guadix, having all their subject towns and\r\nterritories taken from them, might be starved into submission.\r\n\r\nDon Gutierre de Cardenas, senior commander of Leon, on the other hand,\r\nmaintained that to abandon the siege would be construed by the enemy\r\ninto a sign of weakness and irresolution. It would give new spirits to\r\nthe partisans of El Zagal, and would gain to his standard many of\r\nthe wavering subjects of Boabdil, if it did not encourage the fickle\r\npopulace of Granada to open rebellion. He advised, therefore, that the\r\nsiege should be prosecuted with vigor.\r\n\r\nThe pride of Ferdinand pleaded in favor of the last opinion, for it\r\nwould be doubly humiliating again to return from a campaign in this part\r\nof the Moorish kingdom without effecting a blow. But when he reflected\r\non all that his army had suffered, and on all that it must suffer\r\nshould the siege continue--especially from the difficulty of obtaining\r\na regular supply of provisions for so numerous a host across a great\r\nextent of rugged and mountainous country--he determined to consult the\r\nsafety of his people and to adopt the advice of the marques of Cadiz.\r\n\r\nWhen the soldiery heard that the king was about to raise the siege in\r\nmere consideration of their sufferings, they were filled with generous\r\nenthusiasm, and entreated as with one voice that the siege might never\r\nbe abandoned until the city surrendered.\r\n\r\nPerplexed by conflicting counsels, the king despatched messengers to the\r\nqueen at Jaen, requesting her advice. Posts had been stationed between\r\nthem in such manner that missives from the camp could reach the queen\r\nwithin ten hours. Isabella sent instantly her reply. She left the policy\r\nof raising or continuing the siege to the decision of the king and his\r\ncaptains, but, should they determine to persevere, she pledged herself,\r\nwith the aid of God, to forward them men, money, provisions and all\r\nother supplies until the city should be taken.\r\n\r\nThe reply of the queen determined Ferdinand to persevere, and when his\r\ndetermination was made known to the army, it was hailed with as much joy\r\nas if it had been tidings of a victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIII.\r\n\r\nSIEGE OF BAZA CONTINUED.--HOW KING FERDINAND COMPLETELY INVESTED THE\r\nCITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Moorish prince Cid Hiaya had received tidings of the doubts and\r\ndiscussions in the Christian camp, and flattered himself with hopes\r\nthat the besieging army would soon retire in despair, though the veteran\r\nMohammed shook his head with incredulity. A sudden movement one morning\r\nin the Christian camp seemed to confirm the sanguine hopes of the\r\nprince. The tents were struck, the artillery and baggage were conveyed\r\naway, and bodies of soldiers began to march along the valley. The\r\nmomentary gleam of triumph was soon dispelled. The Catholic king had\r\nmerely divided his host into two camps, the more effectually to distress\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\nOne, consisting of four thousand horse and eight thousand foot, with all\r\nthe artillery and battering engines, took post on the side of the city\r\ntoward the mountain. This was commanded by the marques of Cadiz, with\r\nwhom were Don Alonso de Aguilar, Luis Fernandez Puerto Carrero, and many\r\nother distinguished cavaliers.\r\n\r\nThe other camp was commanded by the king, having six thousand horse\r\nand a great host of foot-soldiers, the hardy mountaineers of Biscay,\r\nGuipuscoa, Galicia, and the Asturias. Among the cavaliers who were with\r\nthe king were the brave count de Tendilla, Don Rodrigo de Mendoza, and\r\nDon Alonso de Cardenas, master of Santiago.\r\n\r\nThe two camps were wide asunder, on opposite sides of the city, and\r\nbetween them lay the thick wilderness of orchards. Both camps were\r\ntherefore fortified by great trenches, breastworks, and palisadoes. The\r\nveteran Mohammed, as he saw these two formidable camps glittering on\r\neither side of the city, and noted the well-known pennons of renowned\r\ncommanders fluttering above them, still comforted his companions. “These\r\ncamps,” said he, “are too far removed from each other for mutual succor\r\nand cooperation, and the forest of orchards is as a gulf between\r\nthem.” This consolation was but of short continuance. Scarcely were the\r\nChristian camps fortified when the ears of the Moorish garrison were\r\nstartled by the sound of innumerable axes and the crash of falling\r\ntrees. They looked with anxiety from their highest towers, and beheld\r\ntheir favorite groves sinking beneath the blows of the Christian\r\npioneers. The Moors sallied forth with fiery zeal to protect their\r\nbeloved gardens and the orchards in which they so much delighted. The\r\nChristians, however, were too well supported to be driven from their\r\nwork. Day after day the gardens became the scene of incessant and bloody\r\nskirmishings; yet still the devastation of the groves went on, for King\r\nFerdinand was too well aware of the necessity of clearing away this\r\nscreen of woods not to bend all his forces to the undertaking. It was\r\na work, however, of gigantic toil and patience. The trees were of such\r\nmagnitude, and so closely set together, and spread over so wide an\r\nextent, that, notwithstanding four thousand men were employed, they\r\ncould scarcely clear a strip of land ten paces broad within a day; and\r\nsuch were the interruptions from the incessant assaults of the Moors\r\nthat it was full forty days before the orchards were completely\r\nlevelled.\r\n\r\nThe devoted city of Baza now lay stripped of its beautiful covering\r\nof groves and gardens, at once its ornament, its delight, and its\r\nprotection. The besiegers went on slowly and surely, with almost\r\nincredible labors, to invest and isolate the city. They connected their\r\ncamps by a deep trench across the plain a league in length, into which\r\nthey diverted the waters of the mountain-streams. They protected this\r\ntrench by palisadoes, fortified by fifteen castles at regular distances.\r\nThey dug a deep trench also, two leagues in length, across the mountain\r\nin the rear of the city, reaching from camp to camp, and fortified it\r\non each side with walls of earth and stone and wood. Thus the Moors were\r\nenclosed on all sides by trenches, palisadoes, walls, and castles,\r\nso that it was impossible for them to sally beyond this great line of\r\ncircumvallation, nor could any force enter to their succor. Ferdinand\r\nmade an attempt likewise to cut off the supply of water from the city;\r\n“for water,” observes the worthy Agapida, “is more necessary to these\r\ninfidels than bread, making use of it in repeated daily ablutions\r\nenjoined by their damnable religion, and employing it in baths and in\r\na thousand other idle and extravagant modes of which we Spaniards and\r\nChristians make but little account.”\r\n\r\nThere was a noble fountain of pure water which gushed out at the foot\r\nof the hill Albohacen just behind the city. The Moors had almost a\r\nsuperstitious fondness for this fountain, and chiefly depended upon it\r\nfor their supplies. Receiving intimation from some deserters of the\r\nplan of King Ferdinand to get possession of this precious fountain,\r\nthey sallied forth at night and threw up such powerful works upon the\r\nimpending hill as to set all attempts of the Christian assailants at\r\ndefiance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIV.\r\n\r\nEXPLOIT OF HERNANDO PEREZ DEL PULGAR AND OTHER CAVALIERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe siege of Baza, while it displayed the skill and science of the\r\nChristian commanders, gave but little scope for the adventurous spirit\r\nand fiery valor of the young Spanish cavaliers. They repined at the\r\ntedious monotony and dull security of their fortified camp, and longed\r\nfor some soul-stirring exploit of difficulty and danger. Two of the most\r\nspirited of these youthful cavaliers were Francisco de Bazan and Antonio\r\nde Cueva, the latter of whom was son to the duke of Albuquerque. As\r\nthey were one day seated on the ramparts of the camp, and venting their\r\nimpatience at this life of inaction, they were overheard by a veteran\r\nadalid, one of those scouts or guides who were acquainted with all parts\r\nof the country. “Seniors,” said he, “if you wish for a service of peril\r\nand profit, if you are willing to pluck the fiery old Moor by the beard,\r\nI can lead you to where you may put your mettle to the proof. Hard by\r\nthe city of Guadix are certain hamlets rich in booty. I can conduct you\r\nby a way in which you may come upon them by surprise, and if you are\r\nas cool in the head as you are hot in the spur, you may bear off your\r\nspoils from under the very eyes of old El Zagal.”\r\n\r\nThe idea of thus making booty at the very gates of Guadix pleased the\r\nhot-spirited youths. These predatory excursions were frequent about\r\nthis time, and the Moors of Padul, Alhenden, and other towns of\r\nthe Alpuxarras had recently harassed the Christian territories by\r\nexpeditions of the kind. Francisco de Bazan and Antonio de Cueva soon\r\nfound other young cavaliers of their age eager to join in the adventure,\r\nand in a little while they had nearly three hundred horse and two\r\nhundred foot ready equipped and eager for the foray.\r\n\r\nKeeping their destination secret, they sallied out of the camp on\r\nthe edge of an evening, and, guided by the adalid, made their way by\r\nstarlight through the most secret roads of the mountains. In this way\r\nthey pressed on rapidly day and night, until early one morning, before\r\ncock-crowing, they fell suddenly upon the hamlets, made prisoners of\r\nthe inhabitants, sacked the houses, ravaged the fields, and, sweeping\r\nthrough the meadows, gathered together all the flocks and herds. Without\r\ngiving themselves time to rest, they set out upon their return, making\r\nwith all speed for the mountains before the alarm should be given and\r\nthe country roused.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the herdsmen, however, had fled to Guadix, and carried\r\ntidings of the ravage to El Zagal. The beard of old Muley trembled with\r\nrage: he immediately sent out six hundred of his choicest horse and\r\nfoot, with orders to recover the booty and to bring those insolent\r\nmarauders captive to Guadix.\r\n\r\nThe Christian cavaliers were urging their cavalgada of cattle and sheep\r\nup a mountain as fast as their own weariness would permit, when, looking\r\nback, they beheld a great cloud of dust, and presently descried the\r\nturbaned host hot upon their traces.\r\n\r\nThey saw that the Moors were superior in number; they were fresh also,\r\nboth man and steed, whereas both they and their horses were fatigued\r\nby two days and two nights of hard marching. Several of the horsemen\r\ntherefore gathered round the commanders and proposed that they should\r\nrelinquish their spoil and save themselves by flight. The captains,\r\nFrancisco de Bazan and Antonio de Cueva, spurned at such craven counsel.\r\n“What?” cried they, “abandon, our prey without striking a blow? Leave\r\nour foot-soldiers too in the lurch, to be overwhelmed by the enemy?\r\nIf any one gives such counsel through fear, he mistakes the course of\r\nsafety, for there is less danger in presenting a bold front to the foe\r\nthan in turning a dastard back, and fewer men are killed in a brave\r\nadvance than in a cowardly retreat.”\r\n\r\nSome of the cavaliers were touched by these words, and declared that\r\nthey would stand by the foot-soldiers like true companions-in-arms: the\r\ngreat mass of the party, however, were volunteers, brought\r\ntogether by chance, who received no pay nor had any common tie to keep\r\nthem together in time of danger. The pleasure of the expedition being\r\nover, each thought but of his own safety, regardless of his companions.\r\nAs the enemy approached the tumult of opinions increased and everything\r\nwas in confusion. The captains, to put an end to the dispute, ordered\r\nthe standard-bearer to advance against the Moors, well knowing that\r\nno true cavalier would hesitate to follow and defend his banner. The\r\nstandard-bearer hesitated: the troops were on the point of taking to\r\nflight.\r\n\r\nUpon this a cavalier of the royal guards rode to the front. It was\r\nHernan Perez del Pulgar, alcayde of the fortress of Salar, the same\r\ndauntless ambassador who once bore to the turbulent people of Malaga\r\nthe king’s summons to surrender. Taking off a handkerchief which he wore\r\nround his head after the Andalusian fashion, he tied it to the end of a\r\nlance and elevated it in the air. “Cavaliers,” cried he, “why do ye take\r\nweapons in your hands if you depend upon your feet for safety? This\r\nday will determine who is the brave man and who the coward. He who\r\nis disposed to fight shall not want a standard: let him follow this\r\nhandkerchief.” So saying, he waved his banner and spurred bravely\r\nagainst the Moors. His example shamed some and filled others with\r\ngenerous emulation: all turned with one accord, and, following Pulgar,\r\nrushed with shouts upon the enemy. The Moors scarcely waited to receive\r\nthe shock of their encounter. Seized with a panic, they took to flight,\r\nand were pursued for a considerable distance with great slaughter. Three\r\nhundred of their dead strewed the road, and were stripped and despoiled\r\nby the conquerors; many were taken prisoners, and the Christian\r\ncavaliers returned in triumph to the camp with a long cavalgada of\r\nsheep and cattle and mules laden with booty, and bearing before them the\r\nsingular standard which had conducted them to victory.\r\n\r\nKing Ferdinand was so pleased with the gallant action of Hernan Perez\r\ndel Pulgar that he immediately conferred on him the honor of knighthood,\r\nusing in the ceremony the sword of Diego de Aguero, the captain of the\r\nroyal guards; the duke of Esculona girded one of his own gilt spurs\r\nupon his heel, and the grand master of Santiago, the count de Cabra, and\r\nGonsalvo of Cordova officiated as witnesses. Furthermore, to perpetuate\r\nin his family the memory of his achievement, the sovereigns authorized\r\nhim to emblazon on his escutcheon a golden lion in an azure field,\r\nbearing a lance with a handkerchief at the end of it. Round the border\r\nof the escutcheon were depicted the eleven alcaydes vanquished in the\r\nbattle.* The foregoing is but one of many hardy and heroic deeds done\r\nby this brave cavalier in the wars against the Moors, by which he gained\r\ngreat renown and the distinguished appellation of “El de las hazanas,”\r\n or “He of the exploits.” **\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Alcantara, Hist. de Granada, tomo iv. cap. 18; Pulgar, Cron.,\r\npart iii.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * *Hernan or Hernando del Pulgar, the historian, secretary to Queen\r\nIsabella, is confounded with this cavalier by some writers. He was also\r\npresent at the siege of Baza, and has recounted this transaction in his\r\nChronicle of the Catholic sovereigns, Ferdinand and Isabella.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXV.\r\n\r\nCONTINUATION OF THE SIEGE OF BAZA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Moorish king, El Zagal, mounted a tower and looked out eagerly to\r\nenjoy the sight of the Christian marauders brought captive into the\r\ngates of Guadix, but his spirits fell when he beheld his own troops\r\nstealing back in the dusk of the evening in broken and dejected parties.\r\n\r\nThe fortune of war bore hard against the old monarch; his mind was\r\nharassed by disastrous tidings brought each day from Baza, of the\r\nsufferings of the inhabitants, and the numbers of the garrison slain in\r\nthe frequent skirmishes. He dared not go in person to the relief of the\r\nplace, for his presence was necessary in Guadix to keep a check upon his\r\nnephew in Granada. He sent reinforcements and supplies, but they were\r\nintercepted and either captured or driven back. Still, his situation\r\nwas in some respects preferable to that of his nephew Boabdil. He\r\nwas battling like a warrior on the last step of his throne; El Chico\r\nremained a kind of pensioned vassal in the luxurious abode of the\r\nAlhambra. The chivalrous part of the inhabitants of Granada could not\r\nbut compare the generous stand made by the warriors of Baza for their\r\ncountry and their faith with their own time-serving submission to the\r\nyoke of an unbeliever. Every account they received of the woes of Baza\r\nwrung their hearts with agony; every account of the exploits of its\r\ndevoted defenders brought blushes to their cheeks. Many stole forth\r\nsecretly with their weapons and hastened to join the besieged, and the\r\npartisans of El Zagal wrought upon the patriotism and passions of the\r\nremainder until another of those conspiracies was formed that were\r\ncontinually menacing the unsteady throne of Granada. It was concerted\r\nby the conspirators to assail the Alhambra on a sudden, slay Boabdil,\r\nassemble the troops, and march to Guadix, where, being reinforced by the\r\ngarrison of that place and led on by the old warrior monarch, they might\r\nfall with overwhelming power upon the Christian army before Baza.\r\n\r\nFortunately for Boabdil, he discovered the conspiracy in time, and the\r\nheads of the leaders were struck off and placed upon the walls of\r\nthe Alhambra--an act of severity unusual with this mild and wavering\r\nmonarch, which struck terror into the disaffected, and produced a kind\r\nof mute tranquillity throughout the city.\r\n\r\nFerdinand had full information of all the movements and measures for the\r\nrelief of Baza, and took precautions to prevent them. Bodies of horsemen\r\nheld watch in the mountain-passes to prevent supplies and intercept\r\nany generous volunteers from Granada, and watch-towers were erected or\r\nscouts placed on every commanding height to give the alarm at the least\r\nsign of a hostile turban.\r\n\r\nThe prince Cid Hiaya and his brave companions-in-arms were thus\r\ngradually walled up, as it were, from the rest of the world. A line\r\nof towers, the battlements of which bristled with troops, girded their\r\ncity, and behind the intervening bulwarks and palisadoes passed and\r\nrepassed continual squadrons of troops. Week after week and month after\r\nmonth passed away, but Ferdinand waited in vain for the garrison to be\r\neither terrified or starved into surrender. Every day they sallied\r\nforth with the spirit and alacrity of troops high fed and flushed with\r\nconfidence. “The Christian monarch,” said the veteran Mohammed Ibn\r\nHassan, “builds his hopes upon our growing faint and desponding--we must\r\nmanifest unusual cheerfulness and vigor. What would be rashness in other\r\nservice becomes prudence with us.” The prince Cid Hiaya agreed with\r\nhim in opinion, and sallied forth with his troops upon all kinds of\r\nhare-brained exploits. They laid ambushes, concerted surprises, and made\r\nthe most desperate assaults. The great extent of the Christian works\r\nrendered them weak in many parts: against these the Moors directed their\r\nattacks, suddenly breaking into them, making a hasty ravage, and bearing\r\noff their booty in triumph to the city. Sometimes they would sally forth\r\nby passes and clefts of the mountain in the rear of the city which it\r\nwas difficult to guard, and, hurrying down into the plain, sweep off all\r\ncattle and sheep that were grazing near the suburbs and all stragglers\r\nfrom the camp.\r\n\r\nThese partisan sallies brought on many sharp and bloody encounters,\r\nin some of which Don Alonso de Aguilar and the alcayde de los Donceles\r\ndistinguished themselves greatly. During one of these hot skirmishes,\r\nwhich happened on the skirts of the mountain about twilight, a cavalier\r\nnamed Martin Galindo beheld a powerful Moor dealing deadly blows about\r\nhim and making great havoc among the Christians. Galindo pressed forward\r\nand challenged him to single combat. The Moor was not slow in answering\r\nthe call.\r\n\r\nCouching their lances, they rushed furiously upon each other. At the\r\nfirst shock the Moor was wounded in the face and borne out of his\r\nsaddle. Before Galindo could check his steed and turn from his career\r\nthe Moor sprang upon his feet, recovered his lance, and, rushing\r\nupon him, wounded him in the head and the arm. Though Galindo was on\r\nhorseback and the Moor on foot, yet such was the prowess and address of\r\nthe latter that the Christian knight, being disabled in the arm, was in\r\nthe utmost peril when his comrades hastened to his assistance. At their\r\napproach the valiant pagan retreated slowly up the rocks, keeping them\r\nat bay until he found himself among his companions.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the young Spanish cavaliers, stung by the triumph of this\r\nMoslem knight, would have challenged others of the Moors to single\r\ncombat, but King Ferdinand prohibited all vaunting encounters of the\r\nkind. He forbade his troops also to provoke skirmishes, well knowing\r\nthat the Moors were more dextrous than most people in this irregular\r\nmode of fighting, and were better acquainted with the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVI.\r\n\r\nHOW TWO FRIARS FROM THE HOLY LAND ARRIVED AT THE CAMP.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the holy Christian army (says Fray Antonio Agapida) was thus\r\nbeleaguering this infidel city of Baza there rode into the camp one\r\nday two reverend friars of the order of St. Francis. One was of\r\nportly person and authoritative air: he bestrode a goodly steed, well\r\nconditioned and well caparisoned, while his companion rode beside him\r\nupon a humble hack, poorly accoutred, and, as he rode, he scarcely\r\nraised his eyes from the ground, but maintained a meek and lowly air.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of two friars in the camp was not a matter of much note,\r\nfor in these holy wars the Church militant continually mingled in the\r\naffray, and helmet and cowl were always seen together; but it was soon\r\ndiscovered that these worthy saints-errant were from a far country and\r\non a mission of great import.\r\n\r\nThey were, in truth, just arrived from the Holy Land, being two of the\r\nsaintly men who kept vigil over the sepulchre of our Blessed Lord at\r\nJerusalem. He of the tall and portly form and commanding presence was\r\nFray Antonio Millan, prior of the Franciscan convent in the Holy City.\r\nHe had a full and florid countenance, a sonorous voice, and was round\r\nand swelling and copious in his periods, like one accustomed to harangue\r\nand to be listened to with deference. His companion was small and spare\r\nin form, pale of visage, and soft and silken and almost whispering in\r\nspeech. “He had a humble and lowly way,” says Agapida, “evermore bowing\r\nthe head, as became one of his calling.” Yet he was one of the most\r\nactive, zealous, and effective brothers of the convent, and when he\r\nraised his small black eye from the earth there was a keen glance out\r\nof the corner which showed that, though harmless as a dove, he was\r\nnevertheless as wise as a serpent.\r\n\r\nThese holy men had come on a momentous embassy from the grand soldan of\r\nEgypt, or, as Agapida terms him in the language of the day, the soldan\r\nof Babylon. The league which had been made between that potentate and\r\nhis arch-foe the Grand Turk, Bajazet II., to unite in arms for the\r\nsalvation of Granada, as has been mentioned in a previous chapter of\r\nthis chronicle, had come to naught. The infidel princes had again\r\ntaken up arms against each other, and had relapsed into their ancient\r\nhostility. Still, the grand soldan, as head of the whole Moslem\r\nreligion, considered himself bound to preserve the kingdom of Granada\r\nfrom the grasp of unbelievers. He despatched, therefore, these two holy\r\nfriars with letters to the Castilian sovereigns, as well as to the pope\r\nand to the king of Naples, remonstrating against the evils done to\r\nthe Moors of the kingdom of Granada, who were of his faith and kindred\r\nwhereas it was well known that great numbers of Christians were indulged\r\nand protected in the full enjoyment of their property, their liberty,\r\nand their faith in his dominions. He insisted, therefore, that this war\r\nshould cease--that the Moors of Granada should be reinstated in the\r\nterritory of which they had been dispossessed: otherwise he threatened\r\nto put to death all the Christians beneath his sway, to demolish their\r\nconvents and temples, and to destroy the Holy Sepulchre.\r\n\r\nThis fearful menace had spread consternation among the Christians of\r\nPalestine, and when the intrepid Fray Antonio Millan and his lowly\r\ncompanion departed on their mission they were accompanied far from the\r\ngates of Jerusalem by an anxious throng of brethren and disciples, who\r\nremained watching them with tearful eyes as long as they were in sight.\r\nThese holy ambassadors were received with great distinction by King\r\nFerdinand, for men of their cloth had ever high honor and consideration\r\nin his court. He had long and frequent conversations with them about\r\nthe Holy Land, the state of the Christian Church in the dominions of the\r\ngrand soldan, and of the policy and conduct of that arch-infidel toward\r\nit. The portly prior of the Franciscan convent was full and round and\r\noratorical in his replies, and the king expressed himself much pleased\r\nwith the eloquence of his periods; but the politic monarch was observed\r\nto lend a close and attentive ear to the whispering voice of the lowly\r\ncompanion, “whose discourse,” adds Agapida, “though modest and low,\r\nwas clear and fluent and full of subtle wisdom.” These holy friars had\r\nvisited Rome in their journeying, where they had delivered the letter of\r\nthe soldan to the sovereign pontiff. His Holiness had written by them\r\nto the Castilian sovereigns, requesting to know what reply they had to\r\noffer to this demand of the Oriental potentate.\r\n\r\nThe king of Naples also wrote to them on the subject, but in wary terms.\r\nHe inquired into the cause of this war with the Moors of Granada, and\r\nexpressed great marvel at its events, as if (says Agapida) both were\r\nnot notorious throughout all the Christian world. “Nay,” adds the worthy\r\nfriar with becoming indignation, “he uttered opinions savoring of little\r\nbetter than damnable heresy; for he observed that, although the Moors\r\nwere of a different sect, they ought not to be maltreated without just\r\ncause; and hinted that if the Castilian sovereigns did not suffer any\r\ncrying injury from the Moors, it would be improper to do anything which\r\nmight draw great damage upon the Christians--as if, when once the sword\r\nof the faith was drawn, it ought ever to be sheathed until this scum\r\nof heathendom were utterly destroyed or driven from the land. But this\r\nmonarch,” he continues, “was more kindly disposed toward the infidels\r\nthan was honest and lawful in a Christian prince, and was at that very\r\ntime in league with the soldan against their common enemy the Grand\r\nTurk.”\r\n\r\nThese pious sentiments of the truly Catholic Agapida are echoed by\r\nPadre Mariana in his history;* but the worthy chronicler Pedro Abarca\r\nattributes the interference of the king of Naples not to lack of\r\northodoxy in religion, but to an excess of worldly policy, he being\r\napprehensive that should Ferdinand conquer the Moors of Granada he might\r\nhave time and means to assert a claim of the house of Aragon to the\r\ncrown of Naples.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Mariana, lib. 25, cap. 15.\r\n\r\n\r\n“King Ferdinand,” continues the worthy father Pedro Abarca, “was no less\r\nmaster of dissimulation than his cousin of Naples; so he replied to\r\nhim with the utmost suavity of manner, going into a minute and patient\r\nvindication of the war, and taking great apparent pains to inform him of\r\nthose things which all the world knew, but of which the other pretended\r\nto be ignorant.” * At the same time he soothed his solicitude about the\r\nfate of the Christians in the empire of the grand soldan, assuring him\r\nthat the great revenue extorted from them in rents and tributes would be\r\na certain protection against the threatened violence.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Abarca, Anales de Aragon, Rey xxx. cap. 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the pope he made the usual vindication of the war--that it was\r\nfor the recovery of ancient territory usurped by the Moors, for the\r\npunishment of wars and violences inflicted upon the Christians, and,\r\nfinally, that it was a holy crusade for the glory and advancement of the\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\n“It was a truly edifying sight,” says Agapida, “to behold these friars,\r\nafter they had had their audience of the king, moving about the camp\r\nalways surrounded by nobles and cavaliers of high and martial renown.\r\nThese were insatiable in their questions about the Holy Land, the state\r\nof the sepulchre of our Lord, and the sufferings of the devoted brethren\r\nwho guarded it and the pious pilgrims who resorted there to pay their\r\nvows. The portly prior of the convent would stand with lofty and\r\nshining countenance in the midst of these iron warriors and declaim with\r\nresounding eloquence on the history of the sepulchre, but the humbler\r\nbrother would ever and anon sigh deeply, and in low tones utter some\r\ntale of suffering and outrage, at which his steel-clad hearers would\r\ngrasp the hilts of their swords and mutter between their clenched teeth\r\nprayers for another crusade.”\r\n\r\nThe pious friars, having finished their mission to the king and been\r\ntreated with all due distinction, took their leave, and wended their way\r\nto Jaen, to visit the most Catholic of queens. Isabella, whose heart was\r\nthe seat of piety, received them as sacred men invested with more than\r\nhuman dignity. During their residence at Jaen they were continually\r\nin the royal presence: the respectable prior of the convent moved and\r\nmelted the ladies of the court by his florid rhetoric, but his lowly\r\ncompanion was observed to have continual access to the royal ear. That\r\nsaintly and soft-spoken messenger (says Agapida) received the reward of\r\nhis humility; for the queen, moved by his frequent representations,\r\nmade in all modesty and lowliness of spirit, granted a yearly sum in\r\nperpetuity of one thousand ducats in gold for the support of the monks\r\nof the Convent of the Holy Sepulchre.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * “La Reyna dio a los Frayles mil ducados de renta cado ano para\r\nel sustento de los religiosos del santo sepulcro, que es la mejor\r\nlimosna y sustento que hasta nuestros dias ha quedado a estos religiosos\r\nde Gerusalem: para donde les dio la Reyna un velo labrado por sus manos,\r\npara poner encima de la santa sepultura del Senor.”--Garibay, “Compend\r\nHist.,” lib. 18, cap. 36.\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, on the departure of these holy ambassadors, the excellent and\r\nmost Catholic queen delivered to them a veil devoutly embroidered with\r\nher own royal hands, to be placed over the Holy Sepulchre;--a precious\r\nand inestimable present, which called forth a most eloquent tribute of\r\nthanks from the portly prior, but which brought tears into the eyes of\r\nhis lowly companion.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * It is proper to mention the result of this mission of the two friars,\r\nand which the worthy Agapida has neglected to record. At a subsequent\r\nperiod the Catholic sovereigns sent the distinguished historian, Pietro\r\nMartyr of Angleria, as ambassador to the grand soldan. That able man\r\nmade such representations as were perfectly satisfactory to the Oriental\r\npotentate. He also obtained from him the remission of many exactions\r\nand extortions heretofore practised upon Christian pilgrims visiting\r\nthe Holy Sepulchre; which, it is presumed, had been gently but cogently\r\ndetailed to the monarch by the lowly friar. Pietro Martyr wrote an\r\naccount of his embassy to the grand soldan--a work greatly esteemed by\r\nthe learned and containing much curious information. It is entitled “De\r\nLegatione Babylonica.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVII.\r\n\r\nHOW QUEEN ISABELLA DEVISED MEANS TO SUPPLY THE ARMY WITH PROVISIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been the custom to laud the conduct and address of King Ferdinand\r\nin this most arduous and protracted war, but the sage Agapida is more\r\ndisposed to give credit to the counsels and measures of the queen, who,\r\nhe observes, though less ostensible in action, was in truth the\r\nvery soul, the vital principle, of this great enterprise. While King\r\nFerdinand was bustling in his camp and making a glittering display with\r\nhis gallant chivalry, she, surrounded by her saintly counsellors in the\r\nepiscopal palace of Jaen, was devising ways and means to keep the king\r\nand his army in existence. She had pledged herself to keep up a supply\r\nof men and money and provisions until the city should be taken. The\r\nhardships of the siege caused a fearful waste of life, but the supply of\r\nmen was the least difficult part of her undertaking. So beloved was\r\nthe queen by the chivalry of Spain that on her calling on them for\r\nassistance not a grandee or cavalier that yet lingered at home but\r\neither repaired in person or sent forces to the camp; the ancient\r\nand warlike families vied with each other in marshalling forth their\r\nvassals, and thus the besieged Moors beheld each day fresh troops\r\narriving before their city, and new ensigns and pennons displayed\r\nemblazoned with arms well known to the veteran warriors.\r\n\r\nBut the most arduous task was to keep up a regular supply of provisions.\r\nIt was not the army alone that had to be supported, but also the\r\ncaptured towns and their garrisons; for the whole country around them\r\nhad been ravaged, and the conquerors were in danger of starving in the\r\nmidst of the land they had desolated. To transport the daily supplies\r\nfor such immense numbers was a gigantic undertaking in a country where\r\nthere was neither water conveyance nor roads for carriages. Everything\r\nhad to be borne by beasts of burden over rugged and broken paths of\r\nmountains and through dangerous defiles exposed to the attacks and\r\nplunderings of the Moors.\r\n\r\nThe wary and calculating merchants accustomed to supply the army shrank\r\nfrom engaging at their own risk in so hazardous an undertaking. The\r\nqueen therefore hired fourteen thousand beasts of burden, and ordered\r\nall the wheat and barley to be brought up in Andalusia and in the\r\ndomains of the knights of Santiago and Calatrava. She entrusted the\r\nadministration of these supplies to able and confidential persons. Some\r\nwere employed to collect the grain; others to take it to the mills;\r\nothers to superintend the grinding and delivery; and others to convey\r\nit to the camp. To every two hundred animals a muleteer was allotted to\r\ntake charge of them on the route. Thus great lines of convoys were in\r\nconstant movement, traversing to and fro, guarded by large bodies of\r\ntroops to defend them from hovering parties of the Moors. Not a single\r\nday’s intermission was allowed, for the army depended upon the constant\r\narrival of the supplies for daily food. The grain when brought into\r\nthe camp was deposited in an immense granary, and sold to the army at a\r\nfixed price, which was never either raised or lowered.\r\n\r\nIncredible were the expenses incurred in these supplies, but the queen\r\nhad ghostly advisers thoroughly versed in the art of getting at the\r\nresources of the country. Many worthy prelates opened the deep purses of\r\nthe Church, and furnished loans from the revenues of their dioceses\r\nand convents, and their pious contributions were eventually rewarded\r\nby Providence a hundred-fold. Merchants and other wealthy individuals,\r\nconfident of the punctual faith of the queen, advanced large sums on\r\nthe security of her word; many noble families lent their plate without\r\nwaiting to be asked. The queen also sold certain annual rents in\r\ninheritance at great sacrifices, assigning the revenues of towns and\r\ncities for the payment. Finding all this insufficient to satisfy the\r\nenormous expenditure, she sent her gold and plate and all her jewels\r\nto the cities of Valencia and Barcelona, where they were pledged for a\r\ngreat amount of money, which was immediately appropriated to keep up the\r\nsupplies of the army.\r\n\r\nThus through the wonderful activity, judgment, and enterprise of this\r\nheroic and magnanimous woman a great host, encamped in the heart of the\r\nwarlike country accessible only over mountain-roads, was maintained in\r\ncontinual abundance. Nor was it supplied merely with the necessaries\r\nand comforts of life. The powerful escorts drew merchants and artificers\r\nfrom all parts to repair, as if in caravans, to this great military\r\nmarket. In a little while the camp abounded with tradesmen and artists\r\nof all kinds to administer to the luxury and ostentation of the\r\nyouthful chivalry. Here might be seen cunning artificers in steel and\r\naccomplished armorers achieving those rare and sumptuous helmets and\r\ncuirasses, richly gilt, inlaid, and embossed, in which the Spanish\r\ncavaliers delighted. Saddlers and harness-makers and horse-milliners\r\nalso were there, whose tents glittered with gorgeous housings and\r\ncaparisons. The merchants spread forth their sumptuous silks, cloths,\r\nbrocades, fine linen, and tapestry. The tents of the nobility were\r\nprodigally decorated with all kinds of the richest stuffs and dazzled\r\nthe eye with their magnificence, nor could the grave looks and grave\r\nspeeches of King Ferdinand prevent his youthful cavaliers from vying\r\nwith each other in the splendor of their dresses and caparisons on all\r\noccasions of parade and ceremony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVIII.\r\n\r\nOF THE DISASTERS WHICH BEFELL THE CAMP.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the Christian camp, thus gay and gorgeous, spread itself out like\r\na holiday pageant before the walls of Baza, while a long line of beasts\r\nof burden laden with provisions and luxuries were seen descending the\r\nvalley from morning till night, and pouring into the camp a continued\r\nstream of abundance, the unfortunate garrison found their resources\r\nrapidly wasting away, and famine already began to pinch the peaceful\r\npart of the community.\r\n\r\nCid Hiaya had acted with great spirit and valor as long as there was any\r\nprospect of success; but he began to lose his usual fire and animation,\r\nand was observed to pace the walls of Baza with a pensive air, casting\r\nmany a wistful look toward the Christian camp, and sinking into profound\r\nreveries and cogitations. The veteran alcayde, Mohammed Ibn Hassan,\r\nnoticed these desponding moods, and endeavored to rally the spirits of\r\nthe prince. “The rainy season is at hand,” would he cry; “the floods\r\nwill soon pour down from the mountains; the rivers will overflow their\r\nbanks and inundate the valleys. The Christian king already begins to\r\nwaver; he dare not linger and encounter such a season in a plain cut up\r\nby canals and rivulets. A single wintry storm from our mountains would\r\nwash away his canvas city and sweep off those gay pavilions like wreaths\r\nof snow before the blast.”\r\n\r\nThe prince Cid Hiaya took heart at these words, and counted the days as\r\nthey passed until the stormy season should commence. As he watched the\r\nChristian camp he beheld it one morning in universal commotion: there\r\nwas an unusual sound of hammers in every part, as if some new engines\r\nof war were constructing. At length, to his astonishment, the walls and\r\nroofs of houses began to appear above the bulwarks. In a little while\r\nthere were above a thousand edifices of wood and plaster erected,\r\ncovered with tiles taken from the demolished towers of the orchards\r\nand bearing the pennons of various commanders and cavaliers, while the\r\ncommon soldiery constructed huts of clay and branches of trees thatched\r\nwith straw. Thus, to the dismay of the Moors, within four days the light\r\ntents and gay pavilions which had whitened their hills and plains passed\r\naway like summer clouds, and the unsubstantial camp assumed the solid\r\nappearance of a city laid out into streets and squares. In the centre\r\nrose a large edifice which overlooked the whole, and the royal standard\r\nof Aragon and Castile, proudly floating above it, showed it to be the\r\npalace of the king.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Cura de los Palacios, Pulgar, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nFerdinand had taken the sudden resolution thus to turn his camp into a\r\ncity, partly to provide against the approaching season, and partly to\r\nconvince the Moors of his fixed determination to continue the siege. In\r\ntheir haste to erect their dwellings, however, the Spanish cavaliers had\r\nnot properly considered the nature of the climate. For the greater part\r\nof the year there scarcely falls a drop of rain on the thirsty soil of\r\nAndalusia. The ramblas, or dry channels of the torrents, remain deep\r\nand arid gashes and clefts in the sides of the mountains; the perennial\r\nstreams shrink up to mere threads of water, which, trickling down the\r\nbottoms of the deep barrancas, or ravines, scarce feed and keep alive\r\nthe rivers of the valleys. The rivers, almost lost in their wide and\r\nnaked beds, seem like thirsty rills winding in serpentine mazes through\r\ndeserts of sand and stones, and so shallow and tranquil in their course\r\nas to be forded in safety in almost every part. One autumnal tempest,\r\nhowever, changes the whole face of nature: the clouds break in deluges\r\namong the vast congregation of mountains; the ramblas are suddenly\r\nfilled with raging floods; the tinkling rivulets swell to thundering\r\ntorrents that come roaring down from the mountains, tumbling great\r\nmasses of rocks in their career. The late meandering river spreads over\r\nits once-naked bed, lashes its surges against the banks, and rushes like\r\na wide and foaming inundation through the valley.\r\n\r\nScarcely had the Christians finished their slightly built edifices when\r\nan autumnal tempest of the kind came scouring from the mountains. The\r\ncamp was immediately overflowed. Many of the houses, undermined by\r\nthe floods or beaten by the rain, crumbled away and fell to the earth,\r\nburying man and beast beneath their ruins. Several valuable lives were\r\nlost, and great numbers of horses and other animals perished. To add to\r\nthe distress and confusion of the camp, the daily supply of provisions\r\nsuddenly ceased, for the rain had broken up the roads and rendered the\r\nrivers impassable. A panic seized upon the army, for the cessation of\r\na single day’s supply produced a scarcity of bread and provender.\r\nFortunately, the rain was but transient: the torrents rushed by and\r\nceased; the rivers shrank back again to their narrow channels, and the\r\nconvoys which had been detained upon their banks arrived safely in the\r\ncamp.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did Queen Isabella hear of this interruption of her supplies\r\nthan, with her usual vigilance and activity, she provided against its\r\nrecurrence. She despatched six thousand foot-soldiers, under the command\r\nof experienced officers, to repair the roads and to make causeways and\r\nbridges for the distance of seven Spanish leagues. The troops also who\r\nhad been stationed in the mountains by the king to guard the defiles\r\nmade two paths, one for the convoys going to the camp, and the other\r\nfor those returning, that they might not meet and impede each other. The\r\nedifices which had been demolished by the late floods were rebuilt in\r\na firmer manner, and precautions were taken to protect the camp from\r\nfuture inundations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIX.\r\n\r\nENCOUNTERS BETWEEN THE CHRISTIANS AND MOORS BEFORE BAZA, AND THE\r\nDEVOTION OF THE INHABITANTS TO THE DEFENCE OF THEIR CITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen King Ferdinand beheld the ravage and confusion produced by a\r\nsingle autumnal storm, and bethought him of all the maladies to which\r\na besieging camp is exposed in inclement seasons, he began to feel his\r\ncompassion kindling for the suffering people of Baza, and an inclination\r\nto grant them more favorable terms. He sent, therefore, several messages\r\nto the alcayde Mohammed Ibn Hassan offering liberty of person and\r\nsecurity of property for the inhabitants and large rewards for himself\r\nif he would surrender the city.\r\n\r\nThe veteran was not to be dazzled by the splendid offers of the monarch:\r\nhe had received exaggerated accounts of the damage done to the Christian\r\ncamp by the late storm, and of the sufferings and discontents of the\r\narmy in consequence of the transient interruption of supplies: he\r\nconsidered the overtures of Ferdinand as proofs of the desperate state\r\nof his affairs. “A little more patience, a little more patience,”\r\n said the shrewd old warrior, “and we shall see this cloud of Christian\r\nlocusts driven away before the winter storms. When they once turn their\r\nbacks, it will be our turn to strike; and, with the help of Allah, the\r\nblow shall be decisive.” He sent a firm though courteous refusal to the\r\nCastilian monarch, and in the mean time animated his companions to sally\r\nforth with more spirit than ever to attack the Spanish outposts and\r\nthose laboring in the trenches. The consequence was a daily occurrence\r\nof daring and bloody skirmishes that cost the lives of many of the\r\nbravest and most adventurous cavaliers of either army.\r\n\r\nIn one of these sallies nearly three hundred horse and two thousand foot\r\nmounted the heights behind the city to capture the Christians who were\r\nemployed upon the works. They came by surprise upon a body of guards,\r\nesquires of the count de Urena, killed some, put the rest to flight, and\r\npursued them down the mountain until they came in sight of a small force\r\nunder the count de Tendilla and Gonsalvo of Cordova. The Moors came\r\nrushing down with such fury that many of the men of the count de\r\nTendilla took to flight. The count braced his buckler, grasped his\r\ntrusty weapon, and stood his ground with his accustomed prowess.\r\nGonsalvo of Cordova ranged himself by his side, and, marshalling the\r\ntroops which remained with them, they made a valiant front to the Moors.\r\n\r\nThe infidels pressed them hard, and were gaining the advantage when\r\nAlonso de Aguilar, hearing of the danger of his brother Gonsalvo, flew\r\nto his assistance, accompanied by the count of Urena and a body of their\r\ntroops. A fight ensued from cliff to cliff and glen to glen. The Moors\r\nwere fewer in number, but excelled in the dexterity and lightness\r\nrequisite for scrambling skirmishes. They were at length driven from\r\ntheir vantage-ground, and pursued by Alonso de Aguilar and his brother\r\nGonsalvo to the very suburbs of the city, leaving many of their bravest\r\nmen upon the field.\r\n\r\nSuch was one of innumerable rough encounters daily taking place, in\r\nwhich many brave cavaliers were slain without apparent benefit to either\r\nparty. The Moors, notwithstanding repeated defeats and losses, continued\r\nto sally forth daily with astonishing spirit and vigor, and the\r\nobstinacy of their defence seemed to increase with their sufferings.\r\n\r\nThe prince Cid Hiaya was ever foremost in these sallies, but grew daily\r\nmore despairing of success. All the money in the military chest was\r\nexpended, and there was no longer wherewithal to pay the hired troops.\r\nStill, the veteran Mohammed undertook to provide for this emergency.\r\nSummoning the principal inhabitants, he represented the necessity of\r\nsome exertion and sacrifice on their part to maintain the defence of\r\nthe city. “The enemy,” said he, “dreads the approach of winter, and our\r\nperseverance drives him to despair. A little longer, and he will leave\r\nyou in quiet enjoyment of your homes and families. But our troops must\r\nbe paid to keep them in good heart. Our money is exhausted and all our\r\nsupplies are cut off. It is impossible to continue our defence without\r\nyour aid.”\r\n\r\nUpon this the citizens consulted together, and collected all their\r\nvessels of gold and silver and brought them to Mohammed. “Take these,”\r\n said they, “and coin or sell or pledge them for money wherewith to pay\r\nthe troops.” The women of Baza also were seized with generous emulation.\r\n“Shall we deck ourselves with gorgeous apparel,” said they, “when our\r\ncountry is desolate and its defenders in want of bread?” So they took\r\ntheir collars and bracelets and anklets and other ornaments of gold,\r\nand all their jewels, and put them in the hands of the veteran alcayde.\r\n“Take these spoils of our vanity,” said they, “and let them contribute\r\nto the defence of our homes and families. If Baza be delivered, we need\r\nno jewels to grace our rejoicing; and if Baza fall, of what avail are\r\nornaments to the captive?”\r\n\r\nBy these contributions was Mohammed enabled to pay the soldiery and\r\ncarry on the defence of the city with unabated spirit.\r\n\r\nTidings were speedily conveyed to King Ferdinand of this generous\r\ndevotion on the part of the people of Baza, and the hopes which the\r\nMoorish commanders gave them that the Christian army would soon abandon\r\nthe siege in despair. “They shall have a convincing proof of the fallacy\r\nof such hopes,” said the politic monarch: so he wrote forthwith to Queen\r\nIsabella praying her to come to the camp in state, with all her train\r\nand retinue, and publicly to take up her residence there for the winter.\r\nBy this means the Moors would be convinced of the settled determination\r\nof the sovereigns to persist in the siege until the city should\r\nsurrender, and he trusted they would be brought to speedy capitulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXX.\r\n\r\nHOW QUEEN ISABELLA ARRIVED AT THE CAMP, AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF HER\r\nARRIVAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nMohammed Ibn Hassan still encouraged his companions with hopes that\r\nthe royal army would soon relinquish the siege, when they heard one\r\nday shouts of joy from the Christian camp and thundering salvos of\r\nartillery. Word was brought at the same time, from the sentinels on the\r\nwatch-towers, that a Christian army was approaching down the valley.\r\nMohammed and his fellow-commanders ascended one of the highest towers\r\nof the walls, and beheld in truth a numerous force in shining array\r\ndescending the hills, and heard the distant clangor of the trumpet and\r\nthe faint swell of triumphant music.\r\n\r\nAs the host drew nearer they descried a stately dame magnificently\r\nattired, whom they soon discovered to be the queen. She was riding on\r\na mule the sumptuous trappings of which were resplendent with gold and\r\nreached to the ground. On her right hand rode her daughter, the princess\r\nIsabella, equally splendid in her array, and on her left the venerable\r\ngrand cardinal of Spain. A noble train of ladies and cavaliers followed,\r\ntogether with pages and esquires, and a numerous guard of hidalgos of\r\nhigh rank arrayed in superb armor. When the veteran Mohammed beheld the\r\nqueen thus arriving in state to take up her residence in the camp, he\r\nshook his head mournfully, and, turning to his captains, “Cavaliers,”\r\n said he, “the fate of Baza is decided.”\r\n\r\nThe Moorish commanders remained gazing with a mingled feeling of grief\r\nand admiration at this magnificent pageant, which foreboded the fall of\r\ntheir city. Some of the troops would have sallied forth on one of their\r\ndesperate skirmishes to attack the royal guard, but the prince Cid Hiaya\r\nforbade them; nor would he allow any artillery to be discharged or\r\nany molestation or insult offered; for the character of Isabella was\r\nvenerated even by the Moors, and most of the commanders possessed that\r\nhigh and chivalrous courtesy which belongs to heroic spirits, for they\r\nwere among the noblest and bravest of the Moorish cavaliers.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Baza eagerly sought every eminence that could command\r\na view of the plain, and every battlement and tower and mosque was\r\ncovered with turbaned heads gazing at the glorious spectacle. They\r\nbeheld King Ferdinand issue forth in royal state, attended by the\r\nmarques of Cadiz, the master of Santiago, the duke of Alva, the admiral\r\nof Castile, and many other nobles of renown, while the whole chivalry of\r\nthe camp, sumptuously arrayed, followed in his train, and the populace\r\nrent the air with acclamations at the sight of the patriotic queen.\r\n\r\nWhen the sovereigns had met and embraced, the two hosts mingled together\r\nand entered the camp in martial pomp, and the eyes of the infidel\r\nbeholders were dazzled by the flash of armor, the splendor of golden\r\ncaparisons, the gorgeous display of silks, brocades, and velvets, of\r\ntossing plumes and fluttering banners. There was at the same time a\r\ntriumphant sound of drums and trumpets, clarions and sackbuts, mingled\r\nwith the sweet melody of the dulcimer, which came swelling in bursts of\r\nharmony that seemed to rise up to the heavens.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Cura de los Palacios, c. 92.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the arrival of the queen (says the historian Hernando del Pulgar, who\r\nwas present at the time) it was marvellous to behold how all at once the\r\nrigor and turbulence of war were softened and the storm of passion sank\r\ninto a calm. The sword was sheathed, the crossbow no longer launched\r\nits deadly shafts, and the artillery, which had hitherto kept up an\r\nincessant uproar, now ceased its thundering. On both sides there was\r\nstill a vigilant guard kept up; the sentinels bristled the walls of\r\nBaza with their lances, and the guards patrolled the Christian camp,\r\nbut there was no sallying forth to skirmish nor any wanton violence or\r\ncarnage.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Many particulars of the scenes and occurrences at the siege of\r\nBaza are also furnished in the letters of the learned Peter Martyr, who\r\nwas present and an admiring eye-witness.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrince Cid Hiaya saw by the arrival of the queen that the Christians\r\nwere determined to continue the siege, and he knew that the city would\r\nhave to capitulate. He had been prodigal of the lives of his soldiers\r\nas long as he thought a military good was to be gained by the sacrifice;\r\nbut he was sparing of their blood in a hopeless cause, and weary of\r\nexasperating the enemy by an obstinate yet hopeless defence.\r\n\r\nAt the request of the prince a parley was granted, and the master\r\ncommander of Leon, Don Gutierrez de Cardenas, was appointed to confer\r\nwith the veteran alcayde Mohammed. They met at an appointed place,\r\nwithin view of both camp and city, attended by cavaliers of either army.\r\nTheir meeting was highly courteous, for they had learnt, from rough\r\nencounters in the field, to admire each other’s prowess. The commander\r\nof Leon in an earnest speech pointed out the hopelessness of any further\r\ndefence, and warned Mohammed of the ills which Malaga had incurred by\r\nits obstinacy. “I promise in the name of my sovereigns,” said he,\r\n“that if you surrender immediately the inhabitants shall be treated\r\nas subjects and protected in property, liberty, and religion. If you\r\nrefuse, you, who are now renowned as an able and judicious commander,\r\nwill be chargeable with the confiscations, captivities, and deaths which\r\nmay be suffered by the people of Baza.”\r\n\r\nThe commander ceased, and Mohammed returned to the city to consult with\r\nhis companions. It was evident that all further resistance was hopeless,\r\nbut the Moorish commanders felt that a cloud might rest upon their names\r\nshould they, of their own discretion, surrender so important a place\r\nwithout its having sustained an assault. Prince Cid Hiaya requested\r\npermission, therefore, to send an envoy to Guadix, with a letter to\r\nthe old monarch, El Zagal, treating of the surrender: the request was\r\ngranted, a safe conduct assured to the envoy, and Mohammed Ibn Hassan\r\ndeparted upon this momentous mission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXI.\r\n\r\nTHE SURRENDER OF BAZA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old warrior-king was seated in an inner chamber of the castle of\r\nGuadix, much cast down in spirit and ruminating on his gloomy fortunes,\r\nwhen an envoy from Baza was announced, and the veteran alcayde Mohammed\r\nstood before him. El Zagal saw disastrous tidings written in his\r\ncountenance. “How fares it with Baza,” said he, summoning up his spirits\r\nto the question. “Let this inform thee,” replied Mohammed, and he\r\ndelivered into his hands the letter from the prince Cid Hiaya.\r\n\r\nThis letter spoke of the desperate situation of Baza, the impossibility\r\nof holding out longer without assistance from El Zagal, and the\r\nfavorable terms held out by the Castilian sovereigns. Had it been\r\nwritten by any other person, El Zagal might have received it with\r\ndistrust and indignation; but he confided in Cid Hiaya as in a second\r\nself, and the words of his letter sank deep in his heart. When he had\r\nfinished reading it, he sighed deeply, and remained for some time lost\r\nin thought, with his head drooping upon his bosom. Recovering himself\r\nat length, he called together the alfaquis and the old men of Guadix\r\nand solicited their advice. It was sign of sore trouble of mind and\r\ndejection of heart when El Zagal sought the advice of others, but his\r\nfierce courage was tamed, for he saw the end of his power approaching.\r\nThe alfaquis and the old men did but increase the distraction of his\r\nmind by a variety of counsel, none of which appeared of any avail, for\r\nunless Baza were succored it was impossible that it should hold out; and\r\nevery attempt to succor it had proved ineffectual. El Zagal dismissed\r\nhis council in despair, and summoned the veteran Mohammed before him.\r\n“God is great,” exclaimed he; “there is but one God, and Mahomet is his\r\nprophet! Return to my cousin, Cid Hiaya; tell him it is out of my power\r\nto aid him; he must do as seems to him for the best. The people of\r\nBaza have performed deeds worthy of immortal fame; I cannot ask them to\r\nencounter further ills and perils in maintaining a hopeless defence.”\r\n\r\nThe reply of El Zagal determined the fate of the city. Cid Hiaya and\r\nhis fellow-commanders capitulated, and were granted the most favorable\r\nterms. The cavaliers and soldiers who had come from other parts to the\r\ndefence of the place were permitted to depart with their arms, horses,\r\nand effects. The inhabitants had their choice either to depart with\r\ntheir property or dwell in the suburbs in the enjoyment of their\r\nreligion and laws, taking an oath of fealty to the sovereigns and\r\npaying the same tribute they had paid to the Moorish kings. The city\r\nand citadel were to be delivered up in six days, within which period the\r\ninhabitants were to remove all their effects; and in the mean time they\r\nwere to place as hostages fifteen Moorish youths, sons of the principal\r\ninhabitants, in the hands of the commander of Leon. When Cid Hiaya and\r\nthe alcayde Mohammed came to deliver up the hostages, among whom were\r\nthe sons of the latter, they paid homage to the king and queen, who\r\nreceived them with the utmost courtesy and kindness, and ordered\r\nmagnificent presents to be given to them, and likewise to the other\r\nMoorish cavaliers, consisting of money, robes, horses, and other things\r\nof great value.\r\n\r\nThe prince Cid Hiaya was so captivated by the grace, the dignity, and\r\ngenerosity of Isabella and the princely courtesy of Ferdinand that he\r\nvowed never again to draw his sword against such magnanimous sovereigns.\r\nThe queen, charmed with his gallant bearing and his animated professions\r\nof devotion, assured him that, having him on her side, she already\r\nconsidered the war terminated which had desolated the kingdom of\r\nGranada.\r\n\r\nMighty and irresistible are words of praise from the lips of sovereigns.\r\nCid Hiaya was entirely subdued by this fair speech from the illustrious\r\nIsabella. His heart burned with a sudden flame of loyalty toward the\r\nsovereigns. He begged to be enrolled amongst the most devoted of their\r\nsubjects, and in the fervor of his sudden zeal engaged not merely to\r\ndedicate his sword to their service, but to exert all his influence,\r\nwhich was great, in persuading his cousin, Muley Abdallah el Zagal, to\r\nsurrender the cities of Guadix and Almeria and to give up all further\r\nhostilities. Nay, so powerful was the effect produced upon his mind\r\nby his conversation with the sovereigns that it extended even to his\r\nreligion; for he became immediately enlightened as to the heathenish\r\nabominations of the vile sect of Mahomet, and struck with the truths\r\nof Christianity as illustrated by such powerful monarchs. He consented,\r\ntherefore, to be baptized and to be gathered into the fold of the\r\nChurch. The pious Agapida indulges in a triumphant strain of exultation\r\non the sudden and surprising conversion of this princely infidel:\r\nhe considers it one of the greatest achievements of the Catholic\r\nsovereigns, and indeed one of the marvellous occurrences of this holy\r\nwar. “But it is given to saints and pious monarchs,” says he, “to work\r\nmiracles in the cause of the faith; and such did the most Catholic\r\nFerdinand in the conversion of the prince Cid Hiaya.”\r\n\r\nSome of the Arabian writers have sought to lessen the wonder of this\r\nmiracle by alluding to great revenues granted to the prince and his\r\nheirs by the Castilian monarchs, together with a territory in Marchena,\r\nwith towns, lands, and vassals; but in this (says Agapida) we only see a\r\nwise precaution of King Ferdinand to clinch and secure the conversion of\r\nhis proselyte. The policy of the Catholic monarch was at all times equal\r\nto his piety. Instead also of vaunting of this great conversion and\r\nmaking a public parade of the entry of the prince into the Church, King\r\nFerdinand ordered that the baptism should be performed in private and\r\nkept a profound secret. He feared that Cid Hiaya might otherwise be\r\ndenounced as an apostate and abhorred and abandoned by the Moors,\r\nand thus his influence destroyed in bringing the war to a speedy\r\ntermination.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Conde, tom. 3, cap. 40.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe veteran Mohammed Ibn Hassan was likewise won by the magnanimity and\r\nmunificence of the Castilian sovereigns, and entreated to be received\r\ninto their service; and his example was followed by many other Moorish\r\ncavaliers, whose services were generously accepted and magnificently\r\nrewarded.\r\n\r\nThus; after a siege of six months and twenty days, the city of Baza\r\nsurrendered on the 4th of December, 1489, the festival of the glorious\r\nSanta Barbara, who is said in the Catholic calendar to preside over\r\nthunder and lightning, fire and gunpowder, and all kinds of combustious\r\nexplosions. The king and queen made their solemn and triumphant entry\r\non the following day, and the public joy was heightened by the sight\r\nof upward of five hundred Christian captives, men, women, and children,\r\ndelivered from the Moorish dungeons.\r\n\r\nThe loss of the Christians in this siege amounted to twenty thousand\r\nmen, of whom seventeen thousand died of disease, and not a few of\r\nmere cold--a kind of death (says the historian Mariana) peculiarly\r\nuncomfortable; but (adds the venerable Jesuit) as these latter were\r\nchiefly people of ignoble rank, baggage-carriers and such-like, the loss\r\nwas not of great importance.\r\n\r\nThe surrender of Baza was followed by that of Almunecar, Tavernas, and\r\nmost of the fortresses of the Alpuxarras mountains; the inhabitants\r\nhoped by prompt and voluntary submission to secure equally favorable\r\nterms with those granted to the captured city, and the alcaydes to\r\nreceive similar rewards to those lavished on its commanders; nor were\r\neither of them disappointed. The inhabitants were permitted to remain as\r\nmudexares in the quiet enjoyment of their property and religion; and as\r\nto the alcaydes, when they came to the camp to render up their charges\r\nthey were received by Ferdinand with distinguished favor, and rewarded\r\nwith presents of money in proportion to the importance of the places\r\nthey had commanded. Care was taken by the politic monarch, however, not\r\nto wound their pride nor shock their delicacy; so these sums were paid\r\nunder color of arrears due to them for their services to the former\r\ngovernment. Ferdinand had conquered by dint of sword in the earlier part\r\nof the war, but he found gold as potent as steel in this campaign of\r\nBaza.\r\n\r\nWith several of these mercenary chieftains came one named Ali Aben\r\nFahar, a seasoned warrior who had held many important commands. He was\r\na Moor of a lofty, stern, and melancholy aspect, and stood silent and\r\napart while his companions surrendered their several fortresses and\r\nretired laden with treasure. When it came to his turn to speak, he\r\naddressed the sovereigns with the frankness of a soldier, but with the\r\ntone of dejection and despair.\r\n\r\n“I am a Moor,” said he, “and of Moorish lineage, and am alcayde of the\r\nfair towns and castles of Purchena and Paterna. These were entrusted\r\nto me to defend, but those who should have stood by me have lost all\r\nstrength and courage and seek only for security. These fortresses,\r\ntherefore, most potent sovereigns, are yours whenever you will send to\r\ntake possession of them.”\r\n\r\nLarge sums of gold were immediately ordered by Ferdinand to be delivered\r\nto the alcayde as a recompense for so important a surrender. The Moor,\r\nhowever, put back the gift with a firm and dignified demeanor. “I came\r\nnot,” said he, “to sell what is not mine, but to yield what fortune has\r\nmade yours; and Your Majesties may rest assured that had I been properly\r\nseconded death would have been the price at which I would have sold my\r\nfortresses, and not the gold you offer me.”\r\n\r\nThe Castilian monarchs were struck with the lofty and loyal spirit of\r\nthe Moor, and desired to engage a man of such fidelity in their service;\r\nbut the proud Moslem could not be induced to serve the enemies of his\r\nnation and his faith.\r\n\r\n“Is there nothing, then,” said Queen Isabella, “that we can do to\r\ngratify thee, and to prove to thee our regard?”--“Yes,” replied the\r\nMoor; “I have left behind me, in the towns and valleys which I have\r\nsurrendered, many of my unhappy countrymen, with their wives and\r\nchildren, who cannot tear themselves from their native abodes. Give me\r\nyour royal word that they shall be protected in the peaceable enjoyment\r\nof their religion and their homes.”--“We promise it,” said Isabella;\r\n“they shall dwell in peace and security. But for thyself--what dost\r\nthou ask for thyself?”--“Nothing,” replied Ali, “but permission to pass\r\nunmolested with my horses and effects into Africa.”\r\n\r\nThe Castilian monarchs would fain have forced upon him gold and silver\r\nand superb horses richly caparisoned, not as rewards, but as marks\r\nof personal esteem; but Ali Aben Fahar declined all presents and\r\ndistinctions, as if he thought it criminal to flourish individually\r\nduring a time of public distress, and disdained all prosperity that\r\nseemed to grow out of the ruins of his country.\r\n\r\nHaving received a royal passport, he gathered together his horses and\r\nservants, his armor and weapons, and all his warlike effects, bade adieu\r\nto his weeping countrymen with a brow stamped with anguish, but without\r\nshedding a tear, and, mounting his Barbary steed, turned his back upon\r\nthe delightful valleys of his conquered country, departing on his lonely\r\nway to seek a soldier’s fortune amidst the burning sands of Africa.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Pulgar, part 3, cap. 124; Garibay, lib. 40, cap. 40; Cura de\r\nlos Palacios.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXII.\r\n\r\nSUBMISSION OF EL ZAGAL TO THE CASTILIAN SOVEREIGNS.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvil tidings never fail by the way through lack of messengers: they are\r\nwafted on the wings of the wind, and it is as if the very birds of the\r\nair would bear them to the ear of the unfortunate. The old king El Zagal\r\nburied himself in the recesses of his castle to hide himself from the\r\nlight of day, which no longer shone prosperously upon him, but every\r\nhour brought missives thundering at the gate with the tale of some new\r\ndisaster. Fortress after fortress had laid its keys at the feet of the\r\nChristian sovereigns: strip after strip of warrior mountain and green\r\nfruitful valleys was torn from his domains and added to the territories\r\nof the conquerors. Scarcely a remnant remained to him, except a tract\r\nof the Alpuxarras and the noble cities of Guadix and Almeria. No one any\r\nlonger stood in awe of the fierce old monarch; the terror of his frown\r\nhad declined with his power. He had arrived at that state of adversity\r\nwhen a man’s friends feel emboldened to tell him hard truths and to\r\ngive him unpalatable advice, and when his spirit is bowed down to listen\r\nquietly if not meekly.\r\n\r\nEl Zagal was seated on his divan, his whole spirit absorbed in\r\nrumination on the transitory nature of human glory, when his kinsman and\r\nbrother-in-law, the prince Cid Hiaya, was announced. That illustrious\r\nconvert to the true faith and the interests of the conquerors of his\r\ncountry had hastened to Guadix with all the fervor of a new proselyte,\r\neager to prove his zeal in the service of Heaven and the Castilian\r\nsovereigns by persuading the old monarch to abjure his faith and\r\nsurrender his possessions.\r\n\r\nCid Hiaya still bore the guise of a Moslem, for his conversion was as\r\nyet a secret. The stern heart of El Zagal softened at beholding the\r\nface of a kinsman in this hour of adversity. He folded his cousin to\r\nhis bosom, and gave thanks to Allah that amidst all his troubles he had\r\nstill a friend and counsellor on whom he might rely.\r\n\r\nCid Hiaya soon entered upon the real purpose of his mission. He\r\nrepresented to El Zagal the desperate state of affairs and the\r\nirretrievable decline of Moorish power in the kingdom of Granada.\r\n“Fate,” said he, “is against our arms; our ruin is written in the\r\nheavens. Remember the prediction of the astrologers at the birth of your\r\nnephew Boabdil. We hoped that their prediction was accomplished by his\r\ncapture at Lucena; but it is now evident that the stars portended not a\r\ntemporary and passing reverse of the kingdom, but a final overthrow. The\r\nconstant succession of disasters which have attended our efforts show\r\nthat the sceptre of Granada is doomed to pass into the hands of the\r\nChristian monarchs. Such,” concluded the prince emphatically, and with a\r\nprofound and pious reverence,--“such is the almighty will of God.”\r\n\r\nEl Zagal listened to these words in mute attention, without so much as\r\nmoving a muscle of his face or winking an eyelid. When the prince had\r\nconcluded he remained for a long time silent and pensive; at length,\r\nheaving a profound sigh from the very bottom of his heart, “Alahuma\r\nsubahana hu!” exclaimed he--“the will of God be done! Yes, my cousin, it\r\nis but too evident that such is the will of Allah; and what he wills he\r\nfails not to accomplish. Had not he decreed the fall of Granada, this\r\narm and this scimetar would have maintained it.” *\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Conde, tom. 3, c. 40.\r\n\r\n\r\n“What then remains,” said Cid Hiaya, “but to draw the most advantage\r\nfrom the wreck of empire left to you? To persist in a war is to bring\r\ncomplete desolation upon the land and ruin and death upon its faithful\r\ninhabitants. Are you disposed to yield up your remaining towns to your\r\nnephew El Chico, that they may augment his power and derive protection\r\nfrom his alliance with the Christian sovereigns?”\r\n\r\nThe eye of El Zagal flashed fire at this suggestion. He grasped the hilt\r\nof his scimetar and gnashed his teeth in fury. “Never,” cried he,\r\n“will I make terms with that recreant and slave. Sooner would I see\r\nthe banners of the Christian monarchs floating above my walls than they\r\nshould add to the possessions of the vassal Boabdil!”\r\n\r\nCid Hiaya immediately seized upon this idea, and urged El Zagal to make\r\na frank and entire surrender. “Trust,” said he, “to the magnanimity\r\nof the Castilian sovereigns; they will doubtless grant you high and\r\nhonorable terms. It is better to yield to them as friends what they\r\nmust infallibly and before long wrest from you as enemies; for such, my\r\ncousin, is the almighty will of God.”\r\n\r\n“Alahuma subahana hu!” repeated El Zagal--“the will of God be done!”\r\n So the old monarch bowed his haughty neck and agreed to surrender his\r\nterritories to the enemies of his faith, rather than suffer them to\r\naugment the Moslem power under the sway of his nephew.\r\n\r\nCid Hiaya now returned to Baza, empowered by El Zagal to treat on his\r\nbehalf with the Christian sovereigns. The prince felt a species of\r\nexultation as he expatiated on the rich relics of empire which he was\r\nauthorized to cede. There was a great part of that line of mountains\r\nextending from the metropolis to the Mediterranean Sea, with their\r\nseries of beautiful green valleys like precious emeralds set in a\r\ngolden chain. Above all, there were Guadix and Almeria, two of the most\r\ninestimable jewels in the crown of Granada.\r\n\r\nIn return for these possessions and for the claim of El Zagal to the\r\nrest of the kingdom the sovereigns received him into their friendship\r\nand alliance, and gave him in perpetual inheritance the territory of\r\nAndarax and the valley of Alhaurin in the Alpuxarras, with the fourth\r\npart of the salinas or salt-pits of Malaha. He was to enjoy the title\r\nof king of Andarax, with two thousand mudexares, or conquered Moors,\r\nfor subjects, and his revenues were to be made up to the sum of four\r\nmillions of maravedis. All these he was to hold as a vassal of the\r\nCastilian Crown.\r\n\r\nThese arrangements being made, Cid Hiaya returned with them to Muley\r\nAbdallah, and it was concerted that the ceremony of surrender and homage\r\nshould take place at the city of Almeria.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of December, King Ferdinand departed for that city. Cid\r\nHiaya and his principal officers, incorporated with a division commanded\r\nby the count de Tendilla, marched in the van-guard. The king was with\r\nthe centre of the army, and the queen with the rear-guard. In this\r\nmartial state Ferdinand passed by several of the newly-acquired towns,\r\nexulting in these trophies of his policy rather than his valor. In\r\ntraversing the mountainous region which extends toward the Mediterranean\r\nthe army suffered exceedingly from raging vandavales, or south-west\r\ngales, accompanied by snow-storms. Several of the soldiers and many\r\nhorses and beasts perished with the cold. One of the divisions under the\r\nmarques of Cadiz found it impossible to traverse in one day the frozen\r\nsummits of Filabres, and had to pass the night in those inclement\r\nregions. The marques caused two immense fires to be kindled in the\r\nvicinity of his encampment to guide and enlighten those lost and\r\nwandering among the defiles, and to warm those who were benumbed and\r\nalmost frozen.\r\n\r\nThe king halted at Tavernas, to collect his scattered troops and give\r\nthem time to breathe after the hardships of the mountains. The queen was\r\ntravelling a day’s march in the rear.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of December the king arrived and encamped in the vicinity\r\nof Almeria. Understanding that El Zagal was sallying forth to pay him\r\nhomage according to appointment, he mounted on horseback and rode forth\r\nto receive him, attended by Don Alonso de Cardenas, master of Santiago,\r\non his right hand, and the marques of Cadiz on his left, and despatched\r\nin the advance Don Gutierrez de Cardenas, commander of Leon, and other\r\ncavaliers to meet and form an honorable escort to the Moorish monarch.\r\nWith this escort went that curious eye-witness, Peter Martyr, from whom\r\nwe have many of these particulars.\r\n\r\nEl Zagal was accompanied by twelve cavaliers on horseback, among whom\r\nwas his cousin, the prince Cid Hiaya (who had no doubt joined him from\r\nthe Spanish camp), and the brave Reduan Vanegas. Peter Martyr declares\r\nthat the appearance of El Zagal touched him with compassion, for, though\r\na “lawless barbarian, he was a king and had given signal proofs of\r\nheroism.” The historian Palencia gives us a particular description\r\nof his appearance. He was, says he, of elevated stature and well\r\nproportioned, neither robust nor meagre; the natural fairness of\r\nhis countenance was increased by an extreme paleness which gave it a\r\nmelancholy expression. His aspect was grave; his movements were quiet,\r\nnoble, and dignified. He was modestly attired in a garb of mourning--a\r\nsayo, or loose surcoat, of dark cloth, a simple albornoz or Moorish\r\nmantle, and a turban of dazzling whiteness.\r\n\r\nOn being met by the commander, Gutierrez de Cardenas, El Zagal saluted\r\nhim courteously, as well as the cavaliers who accompanied him, and rode\r\non, conversing with him through the medium of interpreters. Beholding\r\nKing Ferdinand and his splendid train at a distance, he alighted and\r\nadvanced toward him on foot. The punctilious Ferdinand, supposing this\r\nvoluntary act of humiliation had been imposed by Don Gutierrez,\r\ntold that cavalier, with some asperity, that it was an act of great\r\ndiscourtesy to cause a vanquished king to alight before another king who\r\nwas victorious. At the same time he made him signs to remount his\r\nhorse and place himself by his side. El Zagal, persisting in his act of\r\nhomage, offered to kiss the king’s hand, but, being prevented by\r\nthat monarch, he kissed his own hand, as the Moorish cavaliers were\r\naccustomed to do in presence of their sovereigns, and accompanied the\r\ngesture by a few words expressive of obedience and fealty. Ferdinand\r\nreplied in a gracious and amiable manner, and, causing him to remount\r\nand place himself on his left hand, they proceeded, followed by the\r\nwhole train, to the royal pavilion pitched in the most conspicuous part\r\nof the camp.\r\n\r\nThere a banquet was served up to the two kings according to the rigorous\r\nstyle and etiquette of the Spanish court. They were seated in two chairs\r\nof state under the same canopy, El Zagal on the left hand of Ferdinand.\r\nThe cavaliers and courtiers admitted to the royal pavilion remained\r\nstanding. The count de Tendilla served the viands to King Ferdinand in\r\ngolden dishes, and the count Cifuentes gave him to drink out of cups\r\nof the same precious metal; Don Alvaro Bazan and Garcilasso de la Vega\r\nperformed the same offices, in similar style and with vessels of equal\r\nrichness, to the Moorish monarch.\r\n\r\nThe banquet ended, El Zagal took courteous leave of Ferdinand, and\r\nsallied from the pavilion attended by the cavaliers who had been\r\npresent. Each of these now made himself known to the old monarch by his\r\nname, title, or dignity, and each received an affable gesture in reply.\r\nThey would all have escorted the old king back to the gates of Almeria,\r\nbut he insisted on their remaining in the camp, and with difficulty\r\ncould be persuaded upon to accept the honorable attendance of the\r\nmarques of Villena, the commander, Don Gutierrez de Cardenas, the count\r\nde Cifuentes, and Don Luis Puerto Carrero.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning (22d December) the troops were all drawn out in\r\nsplendid array in front of the camp, awaiting the signal of the formal\r\nsurrender of the city. This was given at mid-day, when the gates were\r\nthrown open and a corps marched in, led by Don Gutierrez de Cardenas,\r\nwho had been appointed governor. In a little while the gleam of\r\nChristian warriors was seen on the walls and bulwarks; the blessed cross\r\nwas planted in place of the standard of Mahomet, and the banner of the\r\nsovereigns floated triumphantly above the Alcazar. At the same time\r\na numerous deputation of alfaquis and the noblest and wealthiest\r\ninhabitants of the place sallied forth to pay homage to King Ferdinand.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of December the king himself entered the city with grand\r\nmilitary and religious pomp, and repaired to the mosque of the castle,\r\nwhich had previously been purified and sanctified and converted into a\r\nChristian temple: here grand mass was performed in solemn celebration of\r\nthis great triumph of the faith.\r\n\r\nThese ceremonies were scarcely completed when joyful notice was given of\r\nthe approach of the queen Isabella with the rear-guard of the army. She\r\ncame accompanied by the princess Isabella, and attended by her ghostly\r\ncounsellor the cardinal Mendoza and her confessor Talavera. The king\r\nsallied forth to meet her, accompanied by El Zagal, and it is said the\r\nreception of the latter by the queen was characterized by the deference\r\nand considerate delicacy which belonged to her magnanimous nature.\r\n\r\nThe surrender of Almeria was followed by that of Almunecar, Salobrena,\r\nand other fortified places of the coast and the interior, and\r\ndetachments of Christian troops took quiet possession of the Alpuxarras\r\nmountains and their secluded and fertile valleys.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Cura de los Palacios, cap. 93, 94; Pulgar, Cron., part 3, cap. 124;\r\nGaribay, Comp. Hist., lib. 18, cap. 37, etc. etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXIII.\r\n\r\nEVENTS AT GRANADA SUBSEQUENT TO THE SUBMISSION OF EL ZAGAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho can tell when to rejoice in this fluctuating world? Every wave of\r\nprosperity has its reacting surge, and we are often overwhelmed by\r\nthe very billow on which we thought to be wafted into the haven of our\r\nhopes. When Yusef Aben Comixa, the vizier of Boabdil, surnamed El Chico,\r\nentered the royal saloon of the Alhambra and announced the capitulation\r\nof El Zagal, the heart of the youthful monarch leaped for joy. His great\r\nwish was accomplished; his uncle was defeated and dethroned, and he\r\nreigned without a rival, sole monarch of Granada. At length he was about\r\nto enjoy the fruits of his humiliation and vassalage. He beheld his\r\nthrone fortified by the friendship and alliance of the Castilian\r\nmonarchs; there could be no question, therefore, of its stability.\r\n“Allah Akbar! God is great!” exclaimed he. “Rejoice with me, O Yusef;\r\nthe stars have ceased their persecution. Henceforth let no man call me\r\nEl Zogoybi.”\r\n\r\nIn the first moment of his exultation Boabdil would have ordered public\r\nrejoicings, but the shrewd Yusef shook his head. “The tempest has ceased\r\nfrom one point of the heavens,” said he, “but it may begin to rage from\r\nanother. A troubled sea is beneath us, and we are surrounded by rocks\r\nand quicksands: let my lord the king defer rejoicings until all has\r\nsettled into a calm.” El Chico, however, could not remain tranquil\r\nin this day of exultation: he ordered his steed to be sumptuously\r\ncaparisoned, and, issuing out of the gate of the Alhambra, descended,\r\nwith glittering retinue, along the avenue of trees and fountains, into\r\nthe city to receive the acclamations of the populace. As he entered the\r\ngreat square of the Vivarrambla he beheld crowds of people in violent\r\nagitation, but as he approached what was his surprise to hear groans and\r\nmurmurs and bursts of execration! The tidings had spread through Granada\r\nthat Muley Abdallah el Zagal had been driven to capitulate, and that all\r\nhis territories had fallen into the hands of the Christians. No one had\r\ninquired into the particulars, but all Granada had been thrown into a\r\nferment of grief and indignation. In the heat of the moment old Muley\r\nwas extolled to the skies as a patriot prince who had fought to the last\r\nfor the salvation of his country--as a mirror of monarchs, scorning to\r\ncompromise the dignity of his crown by any act of vassalage. Boabdil,\r\non the contrary, had looked on exultingly at the hopeless yet heroic\r\nstruggle of his uncle; he had rejoiced in the defeat of the faithful\r\nand the triumph of unbelievers; he had aided in the dismemberment and\r\ndownfall of the empire. When they beheld him riding forth in gorgeous\r\nstate on what they considered a day of humiliation for all true Moslems,\r\nthey could not contain their rage, and amidst the clamors that met his\r\nears Boabdil more than once heard his name coupled with the epithets of\r\ntraitor and renegado.\r\n\r\nShocked and discomfited, the youthful monarch returned in confusion to\r\nthe Alhambra, shut himself up within its innermost courts, and remained\r\na kind of voluntary prisoner until the first burst of popular feeling\r\nshould subside. He trusted that it would soon pass away--that the people\r\nwould be too sensible of the sweets of peace to repine at the price at\r\nwhich it was obtained; at any rate, he trusted to the strong friendship\r\nof the Christian sovereigns to secure him even against the factions of\r\nhis subjects.\r\n\r\nThe first missives from the politic Ferdinand showed Boabdil the value\r\nof his friendship. The Christian monarch reminded him of a treaty which\r\nhe had made when captured in the city of Loxa. By this he had engaged\r\nthat in case the Catholic sovereigns should capture the cities of\r\nGuadix, Baza, and Almeria he would surrender Granada into their hands\r\nwithin a limited time, and accept in exchange certain Moorish towns\r\nto be held by him as their vassal. Guadix, Baza, and Almeria had now\r\nfallen; Ferdinand called upon him, therefore, to fulfil his engagement.\r\n\r\nIf the unfortunate Boabdil had possessed the will, he had not the power\r\nto comply with this demand. He was shut up in the Alhambra, while a\r\ntempest of popular fury raged without. Granada was thronged by refugees\r\nfrom the captured towns, many of them disbanded soldiers, and others\r\nbroken-down citizens rendered fierce and desperate by ruin. All railed\r\nat him as the real cause of their misfortunes. How was he to venture\r\nforth in such a storm? Above all, how was he to talk to such men of\r\nsurrender? In his reply to Ferdinand he represented the difficulties of\r\nhis situation, and that, so far from having control over his subjects,\r\nhis very life was in danger from their turbulence. He entreated the\r\nking, therefore, to rest satisfied for the present with his recent\r\nconquests, promising that should he be able to regain full empire over\r\nhis capital and its inhabitants, it would be but to rule over them as\r\nvassal to the Castilian Crown.\r\n\r\nFerdinand was not to be satisfied with such a reply. The time was come\r\nto bring his game of policy to a close, and to consummate his conquest\r\nby seating himself on the throne of the Alhambra. Professing to consider\r\nBoabdil as a faithless ally who had broken his plighted word, he\r\ndiscarded him from his friendship, and addressed a second letter, not\r\nto him, but to the commanders and council of the city. He demanded a\r\ncomplete surrender of the place, with all the arms in the possession\r\neither of the citizens or of others who had recently taken refuge\r\nwithin its walls. If the inhabitants should comply with this summons, he\r\npromised them the indulgent terms granted to Baza, Guadix, and Almeria;\r\nif they should refuse, he threatened them with the fate of Malaga.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Cura de los Palacios, cap. 96.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis message produced the greatest commotion in the city. The\r\ninhabitants of the Alcaiceria, that busy hive of traffic, and all others\r\nwho had tasted the sweets of gainful commerce during the late cessation\r\nof hostilities, were for securing their golden advantages by timely\r\nsubmission: others, who had wives and children, looked on them with\r\ntenderness and solicitude, and dreaded by resistance to bring upon them\r\nthe horrors of slavery.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Granada was crowded with men from all parts,\r\nruined by the war, exasperated by their sufferings, and eager only for\r\nrevenge--with others who had been reared amidst hostilities, who had\r\nlived by the sword, and whom a return of peace would leave without home\r\nor hope. Besides these, there were others no less fiery and warlike in\r\ndisposition, but animated by a loftier spirit. These were valiant and\r\nhaughty cavaliers of the old chivalrous lineages, who had inherited a\r\ndeadly hatred to the Christians from a long line of warrior ancestors,\r\nand to whom the idea was worse than death that Granada--illustrious\r\nGranada, for ages the seat of Moorish grandeur and delight--should\r\nbecome the abode of unbelievers.\r\n\r\nAmong these cavaliers the most eminent was Muza Abul Gazan. He was of\r\nroyal lineage, of a proud and generous nature, and a form combining\r\nmanly strength and beauty. None could excel him in the management of\r\nthe horse and dextrous use of all kinds of weapons: his gracefulness and\r\nskill in the tourney were the theme of praise among the Moorish dames,\r\nand his prowess in the field had made him the terror of the enemy.\r\nHe had long repined at the timid policy of Boabdil, and endeavored to\r\ncounteract its enervating effects and keep alive the martial spirit of\r\nGranada. For this reason he had promoted jousts and tiltings with the\r\nreed, and all those other public games which bear the semblance of war.\r\nHe endeavored also to inculcate into his companions-in-arms those high\r\nchivalrous sentiments which lead to valiant and magnanimous deeds, but\r\nwhich are apt to decline with the independence of a nation. The generous\r\nefforts of Muza had been in a great measure successful: he was the idol\r\nof the youthful cavaliers; they regarded him as a mirror of chivalry and\r\nendeavored to imitate his lofty and heroic virtues.\r\n\r\nWhen Muza heard the demand of Ferdinand that they should deliver up\r\ntheir arms, his eye flashed fire. “Does the Christian king think that we\r\nare old men,” said he, “and that staffs will suffice us? or that we are\r\nwomen, and can be contented with distaffs? Let him know that a Moor is\r\nborn to the spear and scimetar--to career the steed, bend the bow, and\r\nlaunch the javelin: deprive him of these, and you deprive him of his\r\nnature. If the Christian king desires our arms, let him come and win\r\nthem, but let him win them dearly. For my part, sweeter were a grave\r\nbeneath the walls of Granada, on the spot I had died to defend, than\r\nthe richest couch within her palaces earned by submission to the\r\nunbeliever.”\r\n\r\nThe words of Muza were received with enthusiastic shouts by the warlike\r\npart of the populace. Granada once more awoke, as a warrior shaking off\r\na disgraceful lethargy. The commanders and council partook of the\r\npublic excitement, and despatched a reply to the Christian sovereigns,\r\ndeclaring that they would suffer death rather than surrender their city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXIV.\r\n\r\nHOW FERDINAND TURNED HIS HOSTILITIES AGAINST THE CITY OF GRANADA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen King Ferdinand received the defiance of the Moors, he made\r\npreparations for bitter hostilities. The winter season did not admit of\r\nan immediate campaign; he contented himself, therefore, with throwing\r\nstrong garrisons into all his towns and fortresses in the neighborhood\r\nof Granada, and gave the command of all the frontier of Jaen to Inigo\r\nLopez de Mendoza, count of Tendilla, who had shown such consummate\r\nvigilance and address in maintaining the dangerous post of Alhama. This\r\nrenowned veteran established his head-quarters in the mountain-city\r\nof Alcala la Real, within eight leagues of the city of Granada and\r\ncommanding the most important passes of that rugged frontier.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, Granada resounded with the stir of war. The chivalry\r\nof the nation had again control of its councils, and the populace,\r\nhaving once more resumed their weapons, were anxious to wipe out the\r\ndisgrace of their late passive submission by signal and daring exploits.\r\n\r\nMuza Abul Gazan was the soul of action. He commanded the cavalry, which\r\nhe had disciplined with uncommon skill; he was surrounded by the noblest\r\nyouths of Granada, who had caught his own generous and martial fire and\r\npanted for the field, while the common soldiers, devoted to his person,\r\nwere ready to follow him in the most desperate enterprises. He did not\r\nallow their courage to cool for want of action. The gates of Granada\r\nonce more poured forth legions of light scouring cavalry, which skirred\r\nthe country up to the very gates of the Christian fortresses, sweeping\r\noff flocks and herds. The name of Muza became formidable throughout the\r\nfrontier; he had many encounters with the enemy in the rough passes\r\nof the mountains, in which the superior lightness and dexterity of\r\nhis cavalry gave him the advantage. The sight of his glistening legion\r\nreturning across the Vega with long cavalgadas of booty was hailed by\r\nthe Moors as a revival of their ancient triumphs; but when they beheld\r\nChristian banners borne into their gates as trophies, the exultation of\r\nthe light-minded populace was beyond all bounds.\r\n\r\nThe winter passed away, the spring advanced, yet Ferdinand delayed\r\nto take the field. He knew the city of Granada to be too strong and\r\npopulous to be taken by assault, and too full of provisions to be\r\nspeedily reduced by siege. “We must have patience and perseverance,”\r\n said the politic monarch; “by ravaging the country this year we shall\r\nproduce a scarcity the next, and then the city may be invested with\r\neffect.”\r\n\r\nAn interval of peace, aided by the quick vegetation of a prolific soil\r\nand happy climate, had restored the Vega to all its luxuriance and\r\nbeauty; the green pastures on the borders of the Xenil were covered with\r\nflocks and herds; the blooming orchards gave promise of abundant fruit,\r\nand the open plain was waving with ripening corn. The time was at\r\nhand to put in the sickle and reap the golden harvest, when suddenly\r\na torrent of war came sweeping down from the mountains, and Ferdinand,\r\nwith an army of five thousand horse and twenty thousand foot, appeared\r\nbefore the walls of Granada. He had left the queen and princess at the\r\nfortress of Moclin, and came attended by the duke of Medina Sidonia, the\r\nmarques of Cadiz, the marques de Villena, the counts of Urena and Cabra,\r\nDon Alonso de Aguilar, and other renowned cavaliers. On this occasion\r\nhe for the first time led his son, Prince Juan, into the field, and\r\nbestowed upon him the dignity of knighthood. As if to stimulate him to\r\ngrand achievements, the ceremony took place on the banks of the grand\r\ncanal almost beneath the embattled walls of that warlike city, the\r\nobject of such daring enterprises, and in the midst of that famous Vega,\r\nthe field of so many chivalrous exploits. Above them shone resplendent\r\nthe red towers of the Alhambra, rising from amidst delicious groves,\r\nwith the standard of Mahomet waving defiance to the Christian arms.\r\n\r\nThe duke of Medina Sidonia and Roderigo Ponce de Leon, marques of Cadiz,\r\nwere sponsors, and all the chivalry of the camp was assembled on the\r\noccasion. The prince, after he was knighted, bestowed the same honor on\r\nseveral youthful cavaliers of high rank, just entering, like himself, on\r\nthe career of arms.\r\n\r\nFerdinand did not loiter in carrying his desolating plans into\r\nexecution. He detached parties in every direction to lay waste the\r\ncountry: villages were sacked, burnt, and destroyed, and the lovely Vega\r\nwas once more laid waste with fire and sword. The ravage was carried so\r\nclose to Granada that the city was wrapped in the smoke of its gardens\r\nand hamlets. The dismal cloud rolled up the hill and hung about the\r\ntowers of the Alhambra, where the unfortunate Boabdil still remained\r\nshut up from the indignation of his subjects. The hapless monarch smote\r\nhis breast as he looked down from his mountain-palace on the desolation\r\neffected by his late ally. He dared not even show himself in arms among\r\nthe populace, for they cursed him as the cause of the miseries once more\r\nbrought to their doors.\r\n\r\nThe Moors, however, did not suffer the Christians to carry on their\r\nravages unmolested, as in former years. Muza incited them to incessant\r\nsallies. He divided his cavalry into small squadrons, each led by a\r\ndaring commander. They were taught to hover round the Christian camp;\r\nto harass it from various and opposite quarters, cutting off convoys and\r\nstraggling detachments; to waylay the army in its ravaging expeditions,\r\nlurking among rocks and passes of the mountains or in hollows and\r\nthickets of the plain, and practising a thousand stratagems and\r\nsurprises.\r\n\r\nThe Christian army had one day spread itself out rather unguardedly in\r\nits foraging about the Vega. As the troops commanded by the marques of\r\nVillena approached the skirts of the mountains, they beheld a number of\r\nMoorish peasants hastily driving a herd of cattle into a narrow glen.\r\nThe soldiers, eager for booty, pressed in pursuit of them. Scarcely had\r\nthey entered the glen when shouts arose from every side, and they\r\nwere furiously attacked by an ambuscade of horse and foot. Some of\r\nthe Christians took to flight; others stood their ground and fought\r\nvaliantly. The Moors had the vantage-ground; some showered darts and\r\narrows from the cliffs of the rocks, others fought hand to hand on the\r\nplain, while their cavalry carried havoc and confusion into the midst of\r\nthe Christian forces.\r\n\r\nThe marques de Villena, with his brother, Don Alonso de Pacheco, at the\r\nfirst onset of the Moors spurred into the hottest of the fight. They had\r\nscarce entered when Don Alonso was struck lifeless from his horse before\r\nthe eyes of his brother. Estevan Luzon, a gallant captain, fell fighting\r\nbravely by the side of the marques, who remained, with his chamberlain\r\nSoler and a handful of knights, surrounded by the enemy. Several\r\ncavaliers from other parts of the army hastened to their assistance,\r\nwhen King Ferdinand, seeing that the Moors had the vantage-ground and\r\nthat the Christians were suffering severely, gave signal for retreat.\r\nThe marques obeyed slowly and reluctantly, for his heart was full of\r\ngrief and rage at the death of his brother. As he was retiring he beheld\r\nhis faithful chamberlain Soler defending himself valiantly against six\r\nMoors. The marques turned and rushed to his rescue; he killed two of the\r\nenemy with his own hand and put the rest to flight. One of the Moors,\r\nhowever, in retreating, rose in his stirrups, and, hurling his lance at\r\nthe marques, wounded him in the right arm and crippled him for life.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * In consequence of this wound the marques was ever after obliged\r\nto write his signature with his left hand, though capable of managing\r\nhis lance with his right. The queen one day demanded of him why he\r\nhad adventured his life for that of a domestic? “Does not Your Majesty\r\nthink,” replied he, “that I ought to risk one life for him who would\r\nhave adventured three for me had he possessed them?” The queen was\r\ncharmed with the magnanimity of the reply, and often quoted the marques\r\nas setting an heroic example to the chivalry of the age.--Mariana, lib.\r\n25, c. 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was one of the many ambuscadoes concerted by Muza; nor did he\r\nhesitate at times to present a bold front to the Christian forces and\r\ndefy them in the open field. Ferdinand soon perceived, however, that\r\nthe Moors seldom provoked a battle without having the advantage of the\r\nground, and that, though the Christians generally appeared to have the\r\nvictory, they suffered the greatest loss; for retreating was a part\r\nof the Moorish system by which they would draw their pursuers into\r\nconfusion, and then turn upon them with a more violent and fatal attack.\r\nHe commanded his captains, therefore, to decline all challenges to\r\nskirmish, and pursue a secure system of destruction, ravaging the\r\ncountry and doing all possible injury to the enemy with slight risk to\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXV.\r\n\r\nTHE FATE OF THE CASTLE OF ROMA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout two leagues from Granada, on an eminence commanding an extensive\r\nview of the Vega, stood the strong Moorish castle of Roma. Hither the\r\nneighboring peasantry drove their flocks and herds and hurried with\r\ntheir most precious effects on the irruption of a Christian force, and\r\nany foraging or skirmishing party from Granada, on being intercepted in\r\ntheir return, threw themselves into Roma, manned its embattled towers,\r\nand set the enemy at defiance. The garrison were accustomed to have\r\nparties of Moors clattering up to their gates so hotly pursued that\r\nthere was barely time to throw open the portal, receive them within, and\r\nshut out their pursuers; while the Christian cavaliers had many a time\r\nreined up their panting steeds at the very entrance of the barbican,\r\nand retired, cursing the strong walls of Roma that robbed them of their\r\nprey.\r\n\r\nThe late ravages of Ferdinand and the continual skirmishings in the\r\nVega had roused the vigilance of the castle. One morning early, as the\r\nsentinels kept watch upon the battlements, they beheld a cloud of dust\r\nadvancing rapidly from a distance: turbans and Moorish weapons soon\r\ncaught their eyes, and as the whole approached they descried a drove\r\nof cattle urged on in great haste and convoyed by one hundred and fifty\r\nMoors, who led with them two Christian captives in chains.\r\n\r\nWhen the cavalgada arrived near the castle, a Moorish cavalier of noble\r\nand commanding mien and splendid attire rode up to the foot of the tower\r\nand entreated admittance. He stated that they were returning with rich\r\nbooty from a foray into the lands of the Christians, but that the enemy\r\nwas on their traces, and they feared to be overtaken before they could\r\nreach Granada. The sentinels descended in all haste and flung open the\r\ngates. The long cavalgada defiled into the courts of the castle,\r\nwhich were soon filled with bleating and lowing flocks and herds, with\r\nneighing and stamping steeds, and with fierce-looking Moors from the\r\nmountains. The cavalier who had asked admission was the chief of the\r\nparty; he was somewhat advanced in life, of a lofty and gallant bearing,\r\nand had with him a son, a young man of great spirit and fire. Close\r\nby them followed the two Christian captives, with looks cast down and\r\ndisconsolate.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers of the garrison had roused themselves from their sleep, and\r\nwere busily occupied attending to the cattle which crowded the courts,\r\nwhile the foraging party distributed themselves about the castle to\r\nseek refreshment or repose. Suddenly a shout arose that was echoed\r\nfrom courtyard and hall and battlement. The garrison, astonished and\r\nbewildered, would have rushed to their arms, but found themselves,\r\nalmost before they could make resistance, completely in the power of an\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nThe pretended foraging party consisted of mudexares, or Moors tributary\r\nto the Christians, and the commanders were the prince Cid Hiaya and his\r\nson Alnayar. They had hastened from the mountains with this small force\r\nto aid the Catholic sovereigns during the summer’s campaign, and had\r\nconcerted to surprise this important castle and present it to King\r\nFerdinand as a gage of their faith and the first fruits of their\r\ndevotion.\r\n\r\nThe politic monarch overwhelmed his new converts and allies with favors\r\nand distinctions in return for this important acquisition, but he took\r\ncare to despatch a strong force of veteran and genuine Christian troops\r\nto man the fortress.\r\n\r\nAs to the Moors who had composed the garrison, Cid Hiaya remembered that\r\nthey were his countrymen, and could not prevail upon himself to deliver\r\nthem into Christian bondage. He set them at liberty, and permitted\r\nthem to repair to Granada--“a proof,” says the pious Agapida, “that his\r\nconversion was not entirely consummated, but that there were still\r\nsome lingerings of the infidel in his heart.” His lenity was far from\r\nprocuring him indulgence in the opinions of his countrymen; on the\r\ncontrary, the inhabitants of Granada, when they learnt from the\r\nliberated garrison the stratagem by which Roma had been captured, cursed\r\nCid Hiaya for a traitor, and the garrison joined in the malediction.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Pulgar, Cron., part 3, cap. 130; Cura de los Palacios, cap. 90.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the indignation of the people of Granada was destined to be roused\r\nto tenfold violence. The old warrior Muley Abdallah el Zagal had retired\r\nto his little mountain-territory, and for a short time endeavored to\r\nconsole himself with his petty title of king of Andarax. He soon grew\r\nimpatient, however, of the quiet and inaction of his mimic kingdom.\r\nHis fierce spirit was exasperated by being shut up within such narrow\r\nlimits, and his hatred rose to downright fury against Boabdil, whom he\r\nconsidered as the cause of his downfall. When tidings were brought\r\nhim that King Ferdinand was laying waste the Vega, he took a sudden\r\nresolution. Assembling the whole disposable force of his kingdom, which\r\namounted but to two hundred men, he descended from the Alpuxarras and\r\nsought the Christian camp, content to serve as a vassal the enemy of his\r\nfaith and his nation, so that he might see Granada wrested from the sway\r\nof his nephew.\r\n\r\nIn his blind passion the old wrathful monarch injured his cause and\r\nstrengthened the cause of his adversary. The Moors of Granada had been\r\nclamorous in his praise, extolling him as a victim to his patriotism,\r\nand had refused to believe all reports of his treaty with the\r\nChristians; but when they beheld from the walls of the city his banner\r\nmingling with the banners of the unbelievers and arrayed against his\r\nlate people and the capital he had commanded, they broke forth into\r\nrevilings and heaped curses upon his name.\r\n\r\nTheir next emotion, of course, was in favor of Boabdil. They gathered\r\nunder the walls of the Alhambra and hailed him as their only hope, as\r\nthe sole dependence of the country. Boabdil could scarcely believe his\r\nsenses when he heard his name mingled with praises and greeted with\r\nacclamations. Encouraged by this unexpected gleam of popularity, he\r\nventured forth from his retreat and was received with rapture. All his\r\npast errors were attributed to the hardships of his fortune and the\r\nusurpation of his tyrant uncle, and whatever breath the populace could\r\nspare from uttering curses on El Zagal was expended in shouts in honor\r\nof El Chico.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXVI.\r\n\r\nHOW BOABDIL EL CHICO TOOK THE FIELD, AND HIS EXPEDITION AGAINST\r\nALHENDIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor thirty days had the Vega been overrun by the Christian forces, and\r\nthat vast plain, late so luxuriant and beautiful, was one wide scene of\r\ndesolation. The destroying army, having accomplished its task, passed\r\nover the bridge of Pinos and wound up into the mountains on the way to\r\nCordova, bearing away the spoils of towns and villages and driving off\r\nflocks and herds in long dusty columns. The sound of the last Christian\r\ntrumpet died away along the side of the mountain of Elvira, and not a\r\nhostile squadron was seen glistening on the mournful fields of the Vega.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of Boabdil el Chico were at length opened to the real policy of\r\nKing Ferdinand, and he saw that he had no longer anything to depend\r\nupon but the valor of his arm. No time was to be lost in hastening to\r\ncounteract the effect of the late Christian ravage and\r\n\r\nin opening the channel for distant supplies to Granada.\r\n\r\nScarcely had the retiring squadrons of Ferdinand disappeared among the\r\nmountains when Boabdil buckled on his armor, sallied forth from the\r\nAlhambra, and prepared to take the field. When the populace beheld him\r\nactually in arms against his late ally, both parties thronged with zeal\r\nto his standard. The hardy inhabitants also of the Sierra Nevada, or\r\nchain of snow-capped mountains which rise above Granada, descended from\r\ntheir heights and hastened into the city gates to proffer their devotion\r\nto their youthful king. The great square of the Vivarrambla shone\r\nwith legions of cavalry decked with the colors and devices of the most\r\nancient Moorish families, and marshalled forth by the patriot Muza to\r\nfollow the king to battle.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 15th of June that Boabdil once more issued forth from the\r\ngates of Granada on martial enterprise. A few leagues from the city,\r\nwithin full view of it, and at the entrance of the Alpuxarras mountains,\r\nstood the powerful castle of Alhendin. It was built on an eminence\r\nrising from the midst of a small town, and commanding a great part of\r\nthe Vega and the main road to the rich valleys of the Alpuxarras. The\r\ncastle was commanded by a valiant Christian cavalier named Mendo de\r\nQuexada, and garrisoned by two hundred and fifty men, all seasoned and\r\nexperienced warriors. It was a continual thorn in the side of Granada:\r\nthe laborers of the Vega were swept off from their fields by its hardy\r\nsoldiers; convoys were cut off in the passes of the mountains; and, as\r\nthe garrison commanded a full view of the gates of the city, no band of\r\nmerchants could venture forth on their needful journeys without being\r\nswooped up by the war-hawks of Alhendin.\r\n\r\nIt was against this important fortress that Boabdil first led his\r\ntroops, and for six days and nights it was closely besieged. The\r\nalcayde and his veteran garrison defended themselves valiantly, but were\r\nexhausted by fatigue and constant watchfulness; for the Moors, being\r\ncontinually relieved by fresh troops from Granada, kept up an unremitted\r\nand vigorous attack. Twice the barbican was forced, and twice the\r\nassailants were driven forth headlong with excessive loss. The garrison,\r\nhowever, was diminished in number by the killed and wounded; there were\r\nno longer soldiers sufficient to man the walls and gateway; and the\r\nbrave alcayde was compelled to retire with his surviving force to\r\nthe keep of the castle, in which he continued to make a desperate\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\nThe Moors now approached the foot of the tower under shelter of wooden\r\nscreens covered with wet hides to ward off missiles and combustibles.\r\nThey went to work vigorously to undermine the tower, placing props of\r\nwood under the foundations, to be afterward set on fire, so as to give\r\nthe besiegers time to escape before the edifice should fall. Some of\r\nthe Moors plied their crossbows and arquebuses to defend the workmen\r\nand drive the Christians from the walls, while the latter showered\r\ndown stones and darts and melted pitch and flaming combustibles on the\r\nminers.\r\n\r\nThe brave Mendo de Quexada had cast many an anxious eye across the Vega\r\nin hopes of seeing some Christian force hastening to his assistance. Not\r\na gleam of spear or helm was to be descried, for no one had dreamt of\r\nthis sudden irruption of the Moors. The alcayde beheld his bravest\r\nmen dead or wounded around him, while the remainder were sinking with\r\nwatchfulness and fatigue. In defiance of all opposition, the Moors had\r\naccomplished their mine; the fire was brought before the walls that\r\nwas to be applied to the stanchions in case the garrison persisted in\r\ndefence. In a little while the tower would crumble beneath him, and be\r\nrent and hurled a ruin to the plain. At the very last moment the brave\r\nalcayde made the signal of surrender. He marched forth with the\r\nremnant of his veteran garrison, who were all made prisoners. Boabdil\r\nimmediately ordered the walls of the fortress to be razed and fire to\r\nbe applied to the stanchions, that the place might never again become a\r\nstronghold to the Christians and a scourge to Granada. The alcayde and\r\nhis fellow-captives were led in dejected convoy across the Vega, when\r\nthey heard a tremendous crash behind them. They turned to look upon\r\ntheir late fortress, but beheld nothing but a heap of tumbling ruins and\r\na vast column of smoke and dust where once had stood the lofty tower of\r\nAlhendin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXVII.\r\n\r\nEXPLOIT OF THE COUNT DE TENDILLA.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoabdil el Chico followed up his success by capturing the two fortresses\r\nof Marchena and Albolodny, belonging to Cid Hiaya; he also sent his\r\nalfaquis in every direction to proclaim a holy war and to summon all\r\ntrue Moslems of town or castle, mountain or valley, to saddle steed and\r\nbuckle on armor and hasten to the standard of the faith. The tidings\r\nspread far and wide that Boabdil el Chico was once more in the field and\r\nwas victorious. The Moors of various places, dazzled by this gleam of\r\nsuccess, hastened to throw off their sworn allegiance to the Castilian\r\nCrown and to elevate the standard of Boabdil, and the youthful monarch\r\nflattered himself that the whole kingdom was on the point of returning\r\nto its allegiance.\r\n\r\nThe fiery cavaliers of Granada, eager to renew those forays into the\r\nChristian lands in which they had formerly delighted, concerted an\r\nirruption to the north, into the territory of Jaen, to harass the\r\ncountry about Quezada. They had heard of a rich convoy of merchants and\r\nwealthy travellers on the way to the city of Baza, and anticipated a\r\nglorious conclusion to their foray in capturing this convoy.\r\n\r\nAssembling a number of horsemen, lightly armed and fleetly mounted, and\r\none hundred foot-soldiers, they issued forth by night from Granada, made\r\ntheir way in silence through the defiles of the mountains, crossed the\r\nfrontier without opposition, and suddenly appeared, as if fallen from\r\nthe clouds, in the very heart of the Christian country.\r\n\r\nThe mountainous frontier which separates Granada from Jaen was at this\r\ntime under the command of the count de Tendilla, the same veteran who\r\nhad distinguished himself by his vigilance and sagacity when commanding\r\nthe fortress of Alhama. He held his head-quarters at the city of Alcala\r\nla Real, in its impregnable fortress perched high among the mountains,\r\nabout six leagues from Granada, and dominating all the frontier. From\r\nthis cloud-capt hold he kept an eagle eye upon Granada, and had his\r\nscouts and spies in all directions, so that a crow could not fly over\r\nthe border without his knowledge. His fortress was a place of refuge for\r\nthe Christian captives who escaped by night from the Moorish dungeons\r\nof Granada. Often, however, they missed their way in the defiles of the\r\nmountains, and, wandering about bewildered, either repaired by mistake\r\nto some Moorish town or were discovered and retaken at daylight by the\r\nenemy. To prevent these accidents, the count had a tower built at\r\nhis own expense on the top of one of the heights near Alcala, which\r\ncommanded a view of the Vega and the surrounding country. Here he kept\r\na light blazing throughout the night as a beacon for all Christian\r\nfugitives to guide them to a place of safety.\r\n\r\nThe count was aroused one night from his repose by shouts and cries\r\nwhich came up from the town and approached the castle walls. “To arms!\r\nto arms! the Moor is over the border!” was the cry. A Christian soldier,\r\npale and emaciated, who still bore traces of Moorish chains, was brought\r\nbefore the count. He had been taken as guide by the Moorish cavaliers\r\nwho had sallied from Granada, but had escaped from them among the\r\nmountains, and after much wandering had found his way to Alcala by the\r\nsignal-fire.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the bustle and agitation of the moment, the count de\r\nTendilla listened calmly and attentively to the account of the fugitive,\r\nand questioned him minutely as to the time of departure of the Moors and\r\nthe rapidity and direction of their march. He saw that it was too late\r\nto prevent their incursion and ravage, but he determined to await them\r\nand give them a warm reception on their return. His soldiers were always\r\non the alert and ready to take the field at a moment’s warning. Choosing\r\none hundred and fifty lances, hardy and valiant men, well disciplined\r\nand well seasoned--as indeed were all his troops--he issued forth\r\nquietly before break of day, and, descending through the defiles of the\r\nmountains, stationed his little force in ambush in a deep barranca, or\r\ndry channel of a torrent near Barzina, but three leagues from Granada,\r\non the road by which the marauders would have to return. In the mean\r\ntime he sent out scouts to post themselves upon different heights and\r\nlook out for the approach of the enemy.\r\n\r\nAll day they remained concealed in the ravine and for a great part of\r\nthe following night; not a Moor, however, was to be seen, excepting\r\nnow and then a peasant returning from his labor or a solitary muleteer\r\nhastening toward Granada. The cavaliers of the count began to grow\r\nrestless and impatient, fearing that the enemy might have taken some\r\nother route or might have received intelligence of their ambuscade. They\r\nurged the count to abandon the enterprise and return to Alcala. “We\r\nare here,” said they, “almost at the gates of the Moorish capital, our\r\nmovements may have been descried, and before we are aware Granada\r\nmay pour forth its legions of swift cavalry and crush us with an\r\noverwhelming force.” The count, however, persisted in remaining until\r\nhis scouts should come in. About two hours before daybreak there were\r\nsignal-fires on certain Moorish watch-towers of the mountains. While\r\nthey were regarding these with anxiety the scouts came hurrying into the\r\nravine. “The Moors are approaching,” said they; “we have reconnoitred\r\nthem near at hand. They are between one and two hundred strong, but\r\nencumbered with many prisoners and much booty.” The Christian cavaliers\r\nlaid their ears to the ground and heard the distant tramp of horses\r\nand the tread of foot-soldiers. They mounted their horses, braced their\r\nshields, couched their lances, and drew near to the entrance of the\r\nravine where it opened upon the road.\r\n\r\nThe Moors had succeeded in waylaying and surprising the Christian convoy\r\non its way to Baza. They had captured a great number of prisoners, male\r\nand female, with great store of gold and jewels and sumpter mules laden\r\nwith rich merchandise. With these they had made a forced march over the\r\ndangerous parts of the mountains, but now, finding themselves so near to\r\nGranada, fancied themselves in perfect security. They loitered along the\r\nroad, therefore, irregularly and slowly, some singing, others laughing\r\nand exulting at having eluded the boasted vigilance of the count de\r\nTendilla, while ever and anon was heard the plaint of some female\r\ncaptive bewailing the jeopardy of her honor or the heavy sighing of the\r\nmerchant at beholding his property in the grasp of ruthless spoilers.\r\n\r\nThe count waited until some of the escort had passed the ravine; then,\r\ngiving the signal for assault, his cavaliers set up great shouts and\r\ncries and charged into the centre of the foe. The obscurity of the place\r\nand the hour added to the terrors of the surprise. The Moors were thrown\r\ninto confusion; some rallied, fought desperately, and fell covered with\r\nwounds. Thirty-six were killed and fifty-five were made prisoners; the\r\nrest under cover of the darkness made their escape to the rocks and\r\ndefiles of the mountains.\r\n\r\nThe good count unbound the prisoners, gladdening the hearts of the\r\nmerchants by restoring to them their merchandise. To the female captives\r\nalso he restored the jewels of which they had been despoiled, excepting\r\nsuch as had been lost beyond recovery. Forty-five saddle horses of the\r\nchoice Barbary breed remained as captured spoils of the Moors,\r\ntogether with costly armor and booty of various kinds. Having collected\r\neverything in haste and arranged his cavalgada, the count urged his\r\nway with all speed for Alcala la Real, lest he should be pursued and\r\novertaken by the Moors of Granada. As he wound up the steep ascent to\r\nhis mountain-city the inhabitants poured forth to meet him with shouts\r\nof joy. His triumph was doubly enhanced by being received at the gates\r\nof the city by his wife, the daughter of the marques of Villena, a lady\r\nof distinguished merit, whom he had not seen for two years, during which\r\nhe had been separated from his home by the arduous duties of these iron\r\nwars.\r\n\r\nWe have yet another act to relate of this good count de Tendilla, who\r\nwas in truth a mirror of knightly virtue. One day a Christian soldier,\r\njust escaped from captivity in Granada, brought word to the count that\r\nan illustrious damsel named Fatima, niece of the alcayde Aben Comixa,\r\nwas to leave the city on a certain day, escorted by a numerous party of\r\nrelatives and friends of distinguished rank, on a journey to Almunecar,\r\nthere to embark for the African coast to celebrate her nuptials with the\r\nalcayde of Tetuan. This was too brilliant a prize to be neglected. The\r\ncount accordingly sallied forth with a light company of cavalry, and,\r\ndescending the defiles of the mountains, stationed himself behind the\r\nrocky sierra of Elvira, not far from the eventful bridge of Pinos,\r\nwithin a few short miles of Granada. Hence he detached Alonso de\r\nCardenas Ulloa, with fifty light horsemen, to post himself in ambush by\r\nthe road the bridal party had to travel. After a time the latter came in\r\nsight, proving less numerous than had been expected, for the damsel\r\nwas escorted merely by four armed domestics and accompanied by a few\r\nrelatives and two female attendants. The whole party was surrounded and\r\ncaptured almost without resistance, and carried off to the count at the\r\nbridge of Pinos. The good count conveyed his beautiful captive to his\r\nstronghold at Alcala, where he treated her and her companions with all\r\nthe delicacy and respect due to their rank and to his own character as a\r\ncourteous cavalier.\r\n\r\nThe tidings of the capture of his niece gave poignant affliction to the\r\nvizier Aben Comixa. His royal master, Boabdil, of whom he was the prime\r\nfavorite and confidential adviser, sympathized in his distress. With his\r\nown hand he wrote a letter to the count, offering in exchange for the\r\nfair Fatima one hundred Christian captives to be chosen from those\r\ndetained in Granada. This royal letter was sent by Don Francisco de\r\nZuniga, an Aragonese cavalier, whom Aben Comixa held in captivity, and\r\nwho was set at liberty for the purpose.\r\n\r\nOn receiving the letter of Boabdil the count de Tendilla at once gave\r\nfreedom to the Moorish maid, making her a magnificent present of jewels,\r\nand sending her and her companions under honorable escort to the very\r\ngates of Granada.\r\n\r\nBoabdil, exceeding his promises, immediately set free twenty captive\r\npriests, one hundred and thirty Castilian and Aragonian cavaliers, and\r\na number of peasant-women. His favorite and vizier, Aben Comixa, was\r\nso rejoiced at the liberation of his niece, and so struck with the\r\nchivalrous conduct of her captor, that he maintained from that day a\r\nconstant and amicable correspondence with the count de Tendilla, and\r\nbecame in the hands of the latter one of the most efficacious agents in\r\nbringing the war of Granada to a triumphant close.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * This interesting anecdote of the count de Tendilla, which is a key\r\nto the subsequent conduct of the vizier Aben Comixa, and had a singular\r\ninfluence on the fortunes of Boabdil and his kingdom, is originally\r\ngiven in a manuscript history of the counts of Tendilla, written about\r\nthe middle of the sixteenth century by Gabriel Rodriguez de Ardila,\r\na Granadine clergyman. It has been brought to light recently by the\r\nresearches of Alcantara for his History of Granada (vol. 4, cap. 18).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXVIII.\r\n\r\nEXPEDITION OF BOABDIL EL CHICO AGAINST SALOBRENA.--EXPLOIT OF HERNAN\r\nPEREZ DEL PULGAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nKing Boabdil found that his diminished territory was too closely\r\ndominated by Christian fortresses like Alcala la Real, and too strictly\r\nwatched by vigilant alcaydes like the count of Tendilla, to be able to\r\nmaintain itself by internal resources. His foraging expeditions were\r\nliable to be intercepted and defeated, while the ravage of the Vega had\r\nswept off everything on which the city depended for future sustenance.\r\nHe felt the want of a seaport through which, as formerly, he might keep\r\nopen a communication with Africa and obtain reinforcements and supplies\r\nfrom beyond the sea. All the ports and harbors were in the hands of\r\nthe Christians, and Granada and its remnant of dependent territory were\r\ncompletely landlocked.\r\n\r\nIn this emergency the attention of Boabdil was called by circumstances\r\nto the seaport of Salobrena. This redoubtable town has already been\r\nmentioned in this chronicle as a place deemed impregnable by the Moors,\r\ninsomuch that their kings were accustomed in time of peril to keep their\r\ntreasures in its citadel. It was situated on a high rocky hill\r\ndividing one of those rich little vegas or plains which lie open to the\r\nMediterranean, but run like deep green bays into the stern bosoms of the\r\nmountains. The vega was covered with beautiful vegetation, with rice and\r\ncotton, with groves of oranges, citrons, figs, and mulberries, and\r\nwith gardens enclosed by hedges of reeds, of aloes, and the Indian fig.\r\nRunning streams of cool water from the springs and snows of the Sierra\r\nNevada kept this delightful valley continually fresh and verdant, while\r\nit was almost locked up by mountain-barriers and lofty promontories\r\nstretching far into the sea.\r\n\r\nThrough the centre of this rich vega the rock of Salobrena reared its\r\nrugged back, nearly dividing the plain and advancing to the margin of\r\nthe sea, with just a strip of sandy beach at its foot laved by the blue\r\nwaves of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nThe town covered the ridge and sides of the rocky hill, and was\r\nfortified by strong walls and towers, while on the highest and most\r\nprecipitate part stood the citadel, a huge castle that seemed to form a\r\npart of the living rock, the massive ruins of which at the present day\r\nattract the gaze of the traveller as he winds his way far below along\r\nthe road through the vega.\r\n\r\nThis important fortress had been entrusted to the command of Don\r\nFrancisco Ramirez de Madrid, captain-general of the artillery and the\r\nmost scientific of all the Spanish leaders. That experienced veteran,\r\nhowever, was with the king at Cordova, having left a valiant cavalier as\r\nalcayde of the place.\r\n\r\nBoabdil had full information of the state of the garrison and the\r\nabsence of its commander. Putting himself at the head of a powerful\r\nforce, therefore, he departed from Granada, and made a rapid march\r\nthrough the mountains, hoping to seize upon Salobrena before King\r\nFerdinand could come to its assistance.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Salobrena were mudexares, or Moors who had sworn\r\nallegiance to the Christians. Still, when they heard the sound of the\r\nMoorish drums and trumpets, and beheld the squadrons of their countrymen\r\nadvancing across the vega, their hearts yearned toward the standard of\r\ntheir nation and their faith. A tumult arose in the place; the populace\r\nshouted the name of Boabdil el Chico and, throwing open the gates,\r\nadmitted him within the walls.\r\n\r\nThe Christian garrison was too few in number to contend for the\r\npossession of the town: they retreated to the citadel and shut\r\nthemselves within its massive walls, which were considered impregnable.\r\nHere they maintained a desperate defence, hoping to hold out until\r\nsuccor should arrive from the neighboring fortresses.\r\n\r\nThe tidings that Salobrena was invested by the Moorish king spread\r\nalong the sea-coast and filled the Christians with alarm. Don Francisco\r\nEnriquez, uncle of the king, commanded the city of Velez Malaga, about\r\ntwelve leagues distant, but separated by ranges of those vast rocky\r\nmountains which are piled along the Mediterranean and tower in steep\r\npromontories and precipices above its waves.\r\n\r\nDon Francisco summoned the alcaydes of his district to hasten with him\r\nto the relief of this important fortress. A number of cavaliers and\r\ntheir retainers answered to his call, among whom was Hernan Perez del\r\nPulgar, surnamed “El de las hazanas” (He of the exploits)--the same who\r\nhad signalized himself in a foray by elevating a handkerchief on a lance\r\nfor a banner and leading on his disheartened comrades to victory. As\r\nsoon as Don Francisco beheld a little band collected round him, he\r\nset out with all speed for Salobrena. The march was rugged and severe,\r\nclimbing and descending immense mountains, and sometimes winding along\r\nthe edge of giddy precipices, with the surges of the sea raging far\r\nbelow. When Don Francisco arrived with his followers at the lofty\r\npromontory that stretches along one side of the little vega of\r\nSalobrena, he looked down with sorrow and anxiety upon a Moorish army of\r\ngreat force encamped at the foot of the fortress, while Moorish banners\r\non various parts of the walls proved that the town was already in\r\npossession of the infidels. A solitary Christian standard alone floated\r\non the top of the castle-keep, showing that the brave garrison were\r\nhemmed up in their rock-built citadel. They were, in fact, reduced to\r\ngreat extremity through want of water and provisions.\r\n\r\nDon Francisco found it impossible, with his small force, to make any\r\nimpression on the camp of the Moors or to get to the relief of the\r\ncastle. He stationed his little band upon a rocky height near the sea,\r\nwhere they were safe from the assaults of the enemy. The sight of his\r\nfriendly banner waving in their neighborhood cheered the heart of the\r\ngarrison, and gave them assurance of speedy succor from the king, while\r\nthe hostile menaces of Don Francisco served to check the attacks of the\r\nMoors upon the citadel.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, Hernan Perez del Pulgar, who always burned to\r\ndistinguish himself by bold and striking exploits, had discovered in the\r\ncourse of his prowlings a postern gate of the castle opening upon the\r\nsteep part of the rocky hill looking toward the mountains. The thought\r\noccurred to him that by a bold dash at a favorable moment this postern\r\nmight be attained and succor thrown into the castle. He pointed the\r\nplace out to his comrades. “Who will follow my banner,” said he, “and\r\nmake a dash for yonder postern?” A bold proposition in time of warfare\r\nnever wants for bold spirits to accept it. Seventy resolute men\r\nstepped forward to second him. Pulgar chose the early daybreak for his\r\nenterprise, when the Moors, just aroused from sleep, were changing guard\r\nand making the various arrangements of the morning. Favored by these\r\nmovements and the drowsiness of the hour, Pulgar approached the Moorish\r\nline silently and steadily, most of his followers armed with crossbows\r\nand espingardas, or muskets. Then, suddenly making an onset, they broke\r\nthrough a weak part of the camp before the alarm had spread through\r\nthe army, and succeeded in fighting their way up to the gate, which was\r\neagerly thrown open to receive them.\r\n\r\nThe garrison, roused to new spirit by this unlooked-for reinforcement,\r\nwas enabled to make a more vigorous resistance. The Moors, however, who\r\nknew there was a great scarcity of water in the castle, exulted in the\r\nidea that this additional number of warriors would soon exhaust the\r\ncisterns and compel a surrender. Pulgar, hearing of this hope, caused\r\na bucket of water to be lowered from the battlements and threw a silver\r\ncup in bravado to the Moors.\r\n\r\nThe garrison, in truth, suffered intensely from thirst, while, to\r\ntantalize them in their sufferings, they beheld limpid streams winding\r\nin abundance through the green plain below them. They began to fear\r\nthat all succor would arrive too late, when one day they beheld a little\r\nsquadron of vessels far at sea, but standing toward the shore. There\r\nwas some doubt at first whether it might not be a hostile armament from\r\nAfrica, but as it approached they descried, to their great joy, the\r\nbanner of Castile.\r\n\r\nIt was a reinforcement, brought in all haste by the governor of the\r\nfortress, Don Francisco Ramirez. The squadron anchored at a steep\r\nrocky island which rises from the very margin of the smooth sandy beach\r\ndirectly in front of the rock of Salobrena and stretches out into the\r\nsea. On this island Ramirez landed his men, and was as strongly posted\r\nas if in a fortress. His force was too scanty to attempt a battle, but\r\nhe assisted to harass and distract the besiegers. Whenever King Boabdil\r\nmade an attack upon the fortress his camp was assailed on one side by\r\nthe troops of Ramirez, who landed from their island, and on another by\r\nthose of Don Francisco Enriquez, who swept down from their rock,\r\nwhile Hernan del Pulgar kept up a brave defence from every tower and\r\nbattlement of the castle.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the Moorish king was diverted also, for a time, by\r\nan ineffectual attempt to relieve the little port of Adra, which had\r\nrecently declared in his favor, but which had been recaptured for the\r\nChristians by Cid Hiaya and his son Alnayar. Thus, the unlucky Boabdil,\r\nbewildered on every hand, lost all the advantage that he had gained by\r\nhis rapid march from Granada. While he was yet besieging the obstinate\r\ncitadel, tidings were brought him that King Ferdinand was in full march\r\nwith a powerful host to its assistance. There was no time for further\r\ndelay: he made a furious attack with all his forces upon the castle, but\r\nwas again repulsed by Pulgar and his coadjutors, when, abandoning the\r\nsiege in despair, he retreated with his army, lest King Ferdinand should\r\nget between him and his capital. On his way back to Granada, however, he\r\nin some sort consoled himself for his late disappointment by overrunning\r\na part of the territories and possessions lately assigned to his uncle\r\nEl Zagal and to Cid Hiaya. He defeated their alcaydes, destroyed several\r\nof their fortresses, burnt their villages, and, leaving the country\r\nbehind him reeking and smoking with his vengeance, returned with\r\nconsiderable booty to repose himself within the walls of the Alhambra.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Pulgar, Cron., p. 3, c.131; Cura de los Palacios, cap. 97.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXIX.\r\n\r\nHOW KING FERDINAND TREATED THE PEOPLE OF GUADIX, AND HOW EL ZAGAL\r\nFINISHED HIS REGAL CAREER.\r\n\r\n\r\nScarcely had Boabdil (11) ensconced himself in his capital when King\r\nFerdinand, at the head of seven thousand horse and twenty thousand foot,\r\nagain appeared in the Vega. He had set out in all haste from Cordova\r\nto the relief of Salobrena, but hearing on his march that the siege was\r\nraised, he turned to make a second ravage round the walls of devoted\r\nGranada. His present forage lasted fifteen days, in the course of which\r\nalmost everything that had escaped his former desolating visit was\r\ndestroyed, and scarce a green thing or a living animal was left on the\r\nface of the land. The Moors sallied frequently and fought desperately in\r\ndefence of their fields, but the work of destruction was accomplished,\r\nand Granada, once the queen of gardens, was left surrounded by a desert.\r\n\r\nFerdinand next hastened to crush a conspiracy in the cities of Guadix,\r\nBaza, and Almeria. These recently conquered places had entered into\r\nsecret correspondence with Boabdil, inviting him to march to their\r\ngates, promising to rise upon the Christian garrisons, seize upon the\r\ncitadels, and surrender them into his power. The marques of Villena had\r\nreceived notice of the conspiracy, and suddenly thrown himself with a\r\nlarge force into Guadix. Under pretence of a review of the inhabitants\r\nhe made them sally forth into the fields before the city. When the whole\r\nMoorish population capable of bearing arms was thus without the walls,\r\nhe ordered the gates to be closed. He then permitted them to enter two\r\nby two and three by three, and take forth their wives, children, and\r\neffects. The houseless Moors were fain to make themselves temporary\r\nhovels in the gardens and orchards about the city; they were clamorous\r\nin their complaints at being thus excluded from their homes, but were\r\ntold they must wait with patience until the charges against them could\r\nbe investigated and the pleasure of the king be known.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Zurita, lib.--, c. 85; Cura de los Palacios, c. 97.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Ferdinand arrived at Guadix, he found the unhappy Moors in their\r\ncabins among the orchards. They complained bitterly of the deception\r\npractised upon them, and implored permission to return into the city and\r\nlive peaceably in their dwellings, as had been promised them in their\r\narticles of capitulation.\r\n\r\nKing Ferdinand listened graciously to their complaints. “My friends,”\r\n said he in reply, “I have been informed that there has been a conspiracy\r\namong you to kill my alcayde and garrison and to take part with my\r\nenemy, the king of Granada. I shall make a thorough investigation of\r\nthis conspiracy. Those among you who shall be proved innocent shall be\r\nrestored to their dwellings, but the guilty shall incur the penalty of\r\ntheir offences. As I wish, however, to proceed with mercy as well as\r\njustice, I now give you your choice--either to depart at once without\r\nfurther question, going wherever you please, and taking with you your\r\nfamilies and effects under an assurance of safety, or to deliver up\r\nthose who are guilty, not one of whom, I give you my royal word, shall\r\nescape punishment.”\r\n\r\nWhen the people of Guadix heard these words they communed among\r\nthemselves; and, as most of them (says the worthy Agapida) were either\r\nculpable or feared to be considered so, they accepted the alternative\r\nand departed sorrowfully, they and their wives and their little ones.\r\n“Thus,” in the words of that excellent and contemporary historian Andres\r\nBernaldez, commonly called the curate of Los Palacios,--“thus did the\r\nking deliver Guadix from the hands of the enemies of our holy faith\r\nafter seven hundred and seventy years that it had been in their\r\npossession, ever since the time of Roderick the Goth; and this was one\r\nof the mysteries of our Lord, who would not consent that the city should\r\nremain longer in the power of the Moors”--a pious and sage remark which\r\nis quoted with peculiar approbation by the worthy Agapida.\r\n\r\nKing Ferdinand offered similar alternatives to the Moors of Baza,\r\nAlmeria, and other cities accused of participation in this conspiracy,\r\nwho generally preferred to abandon their homes rather than incur the\r\nrisk of an investigation. Most of them relinquished Spain as a country\r\nwhere they could no longer live in security and independence, and\r\ndeparted with their families for Africa; such as remained were suffered\r\nto live in villages and hamlets and other unwalled places.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Garibay, lib. 13, cap. 39; Pulgar, part 3, cap. 132.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Ferdinand was thus occupied at Guadix, dispensing justice and\r\nmercy and receiving cities in exchange, the old monarch, Muley Abdallah,\r\nsurnamed El Zagal, appeared before him. He was haggard with care and\r\nalmost crazed with passion. He had found his little territory of Andarax\r\nand his two thousand subjects as difficult to govern as had been the\r\ndistracted kingdom of Granada. The charm which had bound the Moors to\r\nhim was broken when he appeared in arms under the banner of Ferdinand.\r\nHe had returned from his inglorious campaign with his petty army of two\r\nhundred men, followed by the execrations of the people of Granada and\r\nthe secret repining of those he had led into the field. No sooner had\r\nhis subjects heard of the successes of Boabdil el Chico than they\r\nhad seized their arms, assembled tumultuously, declared for the young\r\nmonarch, and threatened the life of El Zagal.* The unfortunate old\r\nking had with difficulty evaded their fury; and this last lesson seemed\r\nentirely to have cured him of his passion for sovereignty. He now\r\nentreated Ferdinand to purchase the towns and castles and other\r\npossessions which had been granted to him, offering them at a low rate,\r\nand begging safe passage for himself and his followers to Africa. King\r\nFerdinand graciously complied with his wishes. He purchased of him\r\nthree-and-twenty towns and villages in the valleys of Andarax and\r\nAlhaurin, for which he gave him five millions of maravedis. El Zagal\r\nrelinquished his right to one-half of the salinas or salt-pits of Malaha\r\nin favor of his brother-in-law, Cid Hiaya. Having thus disposed of his\r\npetty empire and possessions, he packed up all his treasure, of which he\r\nhad a great amount, and, followed by many Moorish families, passed over\r\nto Africa.**\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Cura de los Palacios, cap. 97.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * *Conde, part 4, cap. 41.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd here let us cast an eye beyond the present period of our chronicle,\r\nand trace the remaining career of El Zagal. His short and turbulent\r\nreign and disastrous end would afford a wholesome lesson to unprincipled\r\nambition, were not all ambition of the kind fated to be blind to precept\r\nand example. When he arrived in Africa, instead of meeting with kindness\r\nand sympathy, he was seized and thrown into prison by the caliph of Fez,\r\nBenimerin, as though he had been his vassal. He was accused of being the\r\ncause of the dissensions and downfall of the kingdom of Granada, and,\r\nthe accusation being proved to the satisfaction of the king of Fez, he\r\ncondemned the unhappy El Zagal to perpetual darkness. A basin of glowing\r\ncopper was passed before his eyes, which effectually destroyed his\r\nsight. His wealth, which had probably been the secret cause of these\r\ncruel measures, was confiscated and seized upon by his oppressor, and El\r\nZagal was thrust forth, blind, helpless, and destitute, upon the world.\r\nIn this wretched condition the late Moorish monarch groped his way\r\nthrough the regions of Tingitania until he reached the city of Velez de\r\nla Gomera. The emir of Velez had formerly been his ally, and felt some\r\nmovement of compassion at his present altered and abject state. He\r\ngave him food and raiment and suffered him to remain unmolested in his\r\ndominions. Death, which so often hurries off the prosperous and happy\r\nfrom the midst of untasted pleasures, spares, on the other hand, the\r\nmiserable to drain the last drop of his cup of bitterness. El Zagal\r\ndragged out a wretched existence of many years in the city of Velez. He\r\nwandered about blind and disconsolate, an object of mingled scorn and\r\npity, and bearing above his raiment a parchment on which was written in\r\nArabic, “This is the unfortunate king of Andalusia.” *\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Marmol, De Rebelione Maur., lib. 1, cap. 16; Padraza, Hist.\r\nGranad., part 3, c. 4; Suarez, Hist. Obisp. de Guadix y Baza, cap. 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XC.\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS OF GRANADA FOR A DESPERATE DEFENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is thy strength departed, O Granada! how is thy beauty withered\r\nand despoiled, O city of groves and fountains! The commerce that once\r\nthronged thy streets is at an end; the merchant no longer hastens to\r\nthy gates with the luxuries of foreign lands. The cities which once paid\r\nthee tribute are wrested from thy sway; the chivalry which filled thy\r\nVivarrambla with sumptuous pageantry have fallen in many battles. The\r\nAlhambra still rears its ruddy towers from the midst of groves, but\r\nmelancholy reigns in its marble halls, and the monarch looks down from\r\nhis lofty balconies upon a naked waste where once extended the blooming\r\nglories of the Vega!\r\n\r\nSuch is the lament of the Moorish writers over the lamentable state of\r\nGranada, now a mere phantom of former greatness. The two ravages of\r\nthe Vega, following so closely upon each other, had swept off all the\r\nproduce of the year, and the husbandman had no longer the heart to till\r\nthe field, seeing the ripening harvest only brought the spoiler to his\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter season Ferdinand made diligent preparations for the\r\ncampaign that was to decide the fate of Granada. As this war was waged\r\npurely for the promotion of the Christian faith, he thought it meet that\r\nits enemies should bear the expenses. He levied, therefore, a general\r\ncontribution upon the Jews throughout his kingdom by synagogues and\r\ndistricts, and obliged them to render in the proceeds at the city of\r\nSeville.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Garibay, lib. 18, c. 39.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of April, Ferdinand and Isabella departed for the Moorish\r\nfrontier, with the solemn determination to lay close siege to Granada\r\nand never quit its walls until they had planted the standard of the\r\nfaith on the towers of the Alhambra. Many of the nobles of the kingdom,\r\nparticularly those from parts remote from the scene of action, wearied\r\nby the toils of war and foreseeing that this would be a tedious siege,\r\nrequiring patience and vigilance rather than hardy deeds of arms,\r\ncontented themselves with sending their vassals, while they stayed at\r\nhome to attend to their domains. Many cities furnished soldiers at\r\ntheir cost, and the king took the field with an army of forty thousand\r\ninfantry and ten thousand horse. The principal captains who followed him\r\nin this campaign were Roderigo Ponce de Leon, the marques of Cadiz,\r\nthe master of Santiago, the marques of Villena, the counts of Tendilla,\r\nCifuentes, Cabra, and Urena, and Don Alonso de Aguilar.\r\n\r\nQueen Isabella, accompanied by her son the prince Juan and the\r\nprincesses Juana, Maria, and Cathalina, her daughters, proceeded to\r\nAlcala la Real, the mountain-fortress and stronghold of the count de\r\nTendilla. Here she remained to forward supplies to the army, and to be\r\nready to repair to the camp whenever her presence might be required.\r\n\r\nThe army of Ferdinand poured into the Vega by various defiles of the\r\nmountains, and on the 23d of April the royal tent was pitched at a\r\nvillage called Los Ojos de Huescar, about a league and a half from\r\nGranada. At the approach of this formidable force the harassed\r\ninhabitants turned pale, and even many of the warriors trembled, for\r\nthey felt that the last desperate struggle was at hand.\r\n\r\nBoabdil el Chico assembled his council in the Alhambra, from the windows\r\nof which they could behold the Christian squadrons glistening through\r\nclouds of dust as they poured along the Vega. The utmost confusion and\r\nconsternation reigned in the council. Many of the members, terrified\r\nwith the horrors impending over their families, advised Boabdil to throw\r\nhimself upon the generosity of the Christian monarch: even several of\r\nthe bravest suggested the possibility of obtaining honorable terms.\r\n\r\nThe wazir of the city, Abul Casim Abdel Melic was called upon to report\r\nthe state of the public means for sustenance and defence. There were\r\nsufficient provisions, he said, for a few months’ supply, independent\r\nof what might exist in the possession of merchants and other rich\r\ninhabitants. “But of what avail,” said he, “is a supply for a few months\r\nagainst the sieges of the Castilian monarch, which are interminable?”\r\n\r\nHe produced also the lists of men capable of bearing arms. “The number,”\r\n said he, “is great, but what can be expected from mere citizen soldiers?\r\nThey vaunt and menace in time of safety; none are so arrogant when the\r\nenemy is at a distance; but when the din of war thunders at the gates\r\nthey hide themselves in terror.”\r\n\r\nWhen Muza heard these words he rose with generous warmth. “What reason\r\nhave we,” said he, “to despair? The blood of those illustrious Moors,\r\nthe conquerors of Spain, still flows in our veins. Let us be true to\r\nourselves, and fortune will again be with us. We have a veteran force,\r\nboth horse and foot, the flower of our chivalry, seasoned in war and\r\nscarred in a thousand battles. As to the multitude of our citizens,\r\nspoken of so slightly, why should we doubt their valor? There are twenty\r\nthousand young men, in the fire of youth, whom I will engage that in the\r\ndefence of their homes they will rival the most valiant veterans. Do\r\nwe want provisions? Our horses are fleet and our horsemen daring in the\r\nforay. Let them scour and scourge the country of those apostate Moslems\r\nwho have surrendered to the Christians. Let them make inroads into the\r\nlands of our enemies. We shall soon see them returning with cavalgadas\r\nto our gates, and to a soldier there is no morsel so sweet as that\r\nwrested with hard fighting from the foe.”\r\n\r\nBoabdil, though he wanted firm and durable courage, was readily excited\r\nto sudden emotions of bravery. He caught a glow of resolution from the\r\nnoble ardor of Muza. “Do what is needful,” said he to his commanders;\r\n“into your hands I confide the common safety. You are the protectors of\r\nthe kingdom, and, with the aid of Allah, will revenge the insults of our\r\nreligion, the deaths of our friends and relations, and the sorrows and\r\nsufferings heaped upon our land.” *\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Conde.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo every one was now assigned his separate duty. The wazir had charge\r\nof the arms and provisions and the enrolling of the people. Muza was to\r\ncommand the cavalry, to defend the gates, and to take the lead in all\r\nsallies and skirmishings. Naim Reduan and Muhammed Aben Zayde were his\r\nadjutants. Abdel Kerim Zegri and the other captains were to guard\r\nthe walls, and the alcaydes of the Alcazaba and of the Red Towers had\r\ncommand of the fortresses.\r\n\r\nNothing now was heard but the din of arms and the bustle of preparation.\r\nThe Moorish spirit, quick to catch fire, was immediately in a flame, and\r\nthe populace in the excitement of the moment set at naught the power\r\nof the Christians. Muza was in all parts of the city, infusing his\r\nown generous zeal into the bosoms of the soldiery. The young cavaliers\r\nrallied round him as their model; the veteran warriors regarded him with\r\na soldier’s admiration; the vulgar throng followed him with shouts; and\r\nthe helpless part of the inhabitants, the old men and the women, hailed\r\nhim with blessings as their protector.\r\n\r\nOn the first appearance of the Christian army the principal gates of the\r\ncity had been closed and secured with bars and bolts and heavy chains:\r\nMuza now ordered them to be thrown open. “To me and my cavaliers,” said\r\nhe, “is entrusted the defence of the gates; our bodies shall be their\r\nbarriers.” He stationed at each gate a strong guard chosen from his\r\nbravest men. His horsemen were always completely armed and ready to\r\nmount at a moment’s warning: their steeds stood saddled and caparisoned\r\nin the stables, with lance and buckler beside them. On the least\r\napproach of the enemy a squadron of horse gathered within the gate,\r\nready to launch forth like the bolt from the thunder-cloud. Muza made no\r\nempty bravado nor haughty threat; he was more terrible in deeds than\r\nin words, and executed daring exploits beyond even the vaunt of the\r\nvainglorious. Such was the present champion of the Moors. Had they\r\npossessed many such warriors, or had Muza risen to power at an earlier\r\nperiod of the war, the fate of Granada might have been deferred, and the\r\nMoor for a long time have maintained his throne within the walls of the\r\nAlhambra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCI.\r\n\r\nHOW KING FERDINAND CONDUCTED THE SIEGE CAUTIOUSLY, AND HOW QUEEN\r\nISABELLA ARRIVED AT THE CAMP.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough Granada was shorn of its glories and nearly cut off from all\r\nexternal aid, still its mighty castles and massive bulwarks seemed to\r\nset all attack at defiance. Being the last retreat of Moorish power,\r\nit had assembled within its walls the remnants of the armies which had\r\ncontended, step by step, with the invaders in their gradual conquest\r\nof the land. All that remained of high-born and high-bred chivalry was\r\nhere; all that was loyal and patriotic was roused to activity by the\r\ncommon danger; and Granada, so long lulled into inaction by vain hopes\r\nof security, now assumed a formidable aspect in the hour of its despair.\r\n\r\nFerdinand saw that any attempt to subdue the city by main force would\r\nbe perilous and bloody. Cautious in his policy, and fond of conquests\r\ngained by art rather than valor, he resorted to the plan so successful\r\nwith Baza, and determined to reduce the place by famine. For this\r\npurpose his armies penetrated into the very heart of the Alpuxarras, and\r\nravaged the valleys and sacked and burnt the towns upon which the city\r\ndepended for its supplies. Scouting parties also ranged the mountains\r\nbehind Granada and captured every casual convoy of provisions. The Moors\r\nbecame more daring as their situation became more hopeless. Never had\r\nFerdinand experienced such vigorous sallies and assaults. Muza at\r\nthe head of his cavalry harassed the borders of the camp, and even\r\npenetrated into the interior, making sudden spoil and ravage, and\r\nleaving his course to be traced by the slain and wounded. To protect his\r\ncamp from these assaults, Ferdinand fortified it with deep trenches and\r\nstrong bulwarks. It was of a quadrangular form, divided into streets\r\nlike a city, the troops being quartered in tents and in booths\r\nconstructed of bushes and branches of trees. When it was completed\r\nQueen Isabella came in state, with all her court and the prince and\r\nprincesses, to be present at the siege. This was intended, as on\r\nformer occasions, to reduce the besieged to despair by showing the\r\ndetermination of the sovereigns to reside in the camp until the city\r\nshould surrender. Immediately after her arrival the queen rode forth to\r\nsurvey the camp and its environs: wherever she went she was attended by\r\na splendid retinue, and all the commanders vied with each other in the\r\npomp and ceremony with which they received her. Nothing was heard from\r\nmorning until night but shouts and acclamations and bursts of martial\r\nmusic; so that it appeared to the Moors as if a continual festival and\r\ntriumph reigned in the Christian camp.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the queen, however and the menaced obstinacy of the\r\nsiege, had no effect in damping the fire of the Moorish chivalry. Muza\r\ninspired the youthful warriors with the most devoted heroism. “We have\r\nnothing left to fight for,” said he, “but the ground we stand on; when\r\nthis is lost we cease to have a country and a name.”\r\n\r\nFinding the Christian king forbore to make an attack, Muza incited his\r\ncavaliers to challenge the youthful chivalry of the Christian army to\r\nsingle combat or partial skirmishes. Scarce a day passed without gallant\r\nconflicts of the kind in sight of the city and the camp. The combatants\r\nrivalled each other in the splendor of their armor and array, as well as\r\nin the prowess of their deeds. Their contests were more like the stately\r\nceremonials of tilts and tournaments than the rude conflicts of the\r\nfield. Ferdinand soon perceived that they animated the fiery Moors with\r\nfresh zeal and courage, while they cost the lives of many of his bravest\r\ncavaliers: he again, therefore, forbade the acceptance of any individual\r\nchallenges, and ordered that all partial encounters should be avoided.\r\nThe cool and stern policy of the Catholic sovereign bore hard upon the\r\ngenerous spirits of either army, but roused the indignation of the Moors\r\nwhen they found that they were to be subdued in this inglorious manner:\r\n“Of what avail,” said they, “are chivalry and heroic valor? The crafty\r\nmonarch of the Christians has no magnanimity in warfare; he seeks to\r\nsubdue us through the weakness of our bodies, but shuns to encounter the\r\ncourage of our souls.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCII.\r\n\r\nOF THE INSOLENT DEFIANCE OF TARFE THE MOOR, AND THE DARING EXPLOIT OF\r\nHERNAN PEREZ DEL PULGAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Moorish knights beheld that all courteous challenges were\r\nunavailing, they sought various means to provoke the Christian warriors\r\nto the field. Sometimes a body of them, fleetly mounted, would gallop\r\nup to the skirts of the camp and try who should hurl his lance farthest\r\nwithin the barriers, having his name inscribed upon it or a label\r\naffixed containing some taunting defiance. These bravadoes caused\r\ngreat irritation; still, the Spanish warriors were restrained by the\r\nprohibition of the king.\r\n\r\nAmong the Moorish cavaliers was one named Tarfe, renowned for strength\r\nand daring spirit, but whose courage partook of fierce audacity rather\r\nthan chivalric heroism. In one of these sallies, when skirting\r\nthe Christian camp, this arrogant Moor outstripped his companions,\r\noverleaped the barriers, and, galloping close to the royal quarters,\r\nlaunched his lance so far within that it remained quivering in the earth\r\nclose by the pavilions of the sovereigns. The royal guards rushed forth\r\nin pursuit, but the Moorish horsemen were already beyond the camp and\r\nscouring in a cloud of dust for the city. Upon wresting the lance from\r\nthe earth a label was found upon it importing that it was intended for\r\nthe queen.\r\n\r\nNothing could equal the indignation of the Christian warriors at the\r\ninsolence of the bravado and the discourteous insult offered to the\r\nqueen. Hernan Perez del Pulgar, surnamed “He of the exploits,” was\r\npresent, and resolved not to be outbraved by this daring infidel. “Who\r\nwill stand by me,” said he, “in an enterprise of desperate peril?” The\r\nChristian cavaliers well knew the harebrained valor of Hernan, yet\r\nnot one hesitated to step forward. He chose fifteen companions, all of\r\npowerful arm and dauntless heart.\r\n\r\nHis project was to penetrate Granada in the dead of the night by a\r\nsecret pass made known to him by a Moorish renegade of the city, whom he\r\nhad christened Pedro Pulgar, and who was to act as guide. They were to\r\nset fire to the Alcaiceria and other principal edifices, and then effect\r\ntheir retreat as best they might. At the hour appointed the adventurous\r\ntroops set forth provided with combustibles. The renegade led them\r\nsilently to a drain or channel of the river Darro, up which they\r\nproceeded cautiously, single file, until they halted under a bridge near\r\nthe royal gate. Here dismounting, Pulgar stationed six of his companions\r\nto remain silent and motionless and keep guard, while, followed by the\r\nrest and still guided by the renegade, he continued up the drain or\r\nchannel of the Darro, which passes under a part of the city, and was\r\nthus enabled to make his way undiscovered into the streets. All was\r\ndark and silent. At the command of Pulgar the renegade led him to the\r\nprincipal mosque. Here the cavalier, pious as brave, threw himself on\r\nhis knees, and, drawing forth a parchment scroll on which was inscribed\r\nin large letters “AVE MARIA,” nailed it to the door of the mosque, thus\r\nconverting the heathen edifice into a Christian chapel and dedicating it\r\nto the Blessed Virgin. This done, he hastened to the Alcaiceria to\r\nset it in a blaze. The combustibles were all placed, but Tristan de\r\nMontemayor, who had charge of the firebrand, had carelessly left it\r\nat the door of the mosque. It was too late to return there. Pulgar was\r\nendeavoring to strike fire with flint and steel into the ravelled end of\r\na cord when he was startled by the approach of the Moorish guards going\r\nthe rounds. His hand was on his sword in an instant. Seconded by his\r\nbrave companions, he assailed the astonished Moors and put them to\r\nflight. In a little while the whole city resounded with alarms, soldiers\r\nwere hurrying through the streets in every direction; but Pulgar, guided\r\nby the renegade, made good his retreat by the channel of the Darro to\r\nhis companions at the bridge, and all, mounting their horses, spurred\r\nback to the camp. The Moors were at a loss to imagine the meaning\r\nof this wild and apparently fruitless assault, but great was their\r\nexasperation on the following day when the trophy of hardihood and\r\nprowess, the “AVE MARIA,” was discovered thus elevated in bravado in the\r\nvery centre of the city. The mosque thus boldly sanctified by Hernan del\r\nPulgar was actually consecrated into a cathedral after the capture of\r\nGranada.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * The account here given of the exploit of Hernan del Pulgar differs\r\nfrom that given in the first edition, and is conformable to the record\r\nof the fact in a manuscript called “The House of Salar,” existing in the\r\nlibrary of Salazar and cited by Alcantara in his History of Granada.\r\n\r\nIn commemoration of this daring feat of Pulgar, the emperor Charles V.\r\nin after years conferred on that cavalier and on his descendants, the\r\nmarqueses of Salar, the privilege of sitting in the choir during high\r\nmass, and assigned as the place of sepulture of Pulgar himself the\r\nidentical spot where he kneeled to affix the sacred scroll; and his tomb\r\nis still held in great veneration. This Hernan Perez del Pulgar was a\r\nman of letters, as well as art, and inscribed to Charles V. a summary of\r\nthe achievements of Gonsalvo of Cordova, surnamed the Great Captain,\r\nwho had been one of his comrades-in-arms. He is often confounded with\r\nHernando del Pulgar, historian and secretary to Queen Isabella. (See\r\nnote to Pulgar’s Chron. of the Catholic Sovereigns, part 3, c. iii.,\r\nedit. Valencia, 1780.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCIII.\r\n\r\nHOW QUEEN ISABELLA TOOK A VIEW OF THE CITY OF GRANADA, AND HOW HER\r\nCURIOSITY COST THE LIVES OF MANY CHRISTIANS AND MOORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe royal encampment lay so distant from Granada that the general aspect\r\nof the city only could be seen as it rose gracefully from the Vega,\r\ncovering the sides of the hills with palaces and towers. Queen Isabella\r\nhad expressed an earnest desire to behold nearer at hand a city whose\r\nbeauty was so renowned throughout the world; and the marques of Cadiz,\r\nwith his accustomed courtesy, prepared a great military escort and\r\nguard to protect her and the ladies of the court while they enjoyed this\r\nperilous gratification.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of June the 18th a magnificent and powerful train issued\r\nfrom the Christian camp. The advanced guard was composed of legions of\r\ncavalry, heavily armed, looking like moving masses of polished steel.\r\nThen came the king and queen, with the prince and princess and the\r\nladies of the court, surrounded by the royal body-guard, sumptuously\r\narrayed, composed of the sons of the most illustrious houses of Spain;\r\nafter these was the rear-guard, a powerful force of horse and foot,\r\nfor the flower of the army sallied forth that day. The Moors gazed with\r\nfearful admiration at this glorious pageant, wherein the pomp of the\r\ncourt was mingled with the terrors of the camp. It moved along in\r\nradiant line across the Vega to the melodious thunders of martial music,\r\nwhile banner and plume and silken scarf and rich brocade gave a gay and\r\ngorgeous relief to the grim visage of iron war that lurked beneath.\r\n\r\nThe army moved toward the hamlet of Zubia, built on the skirts of the\r\nmountain to the left of Granada, and commanding a view of the Alhambra\r\nand the most beautiful quarter of the city. As they approached the\r\nhamlet the marques of Villena, the count Urena, and Don Alonso de\r\nAguilar fled off with their battalions, and were soon seen glittering\r\nalong the side of the mountain above the village. In the mean time, the\r\nmarques of Cadiz, the count de Tendilla, the count de Cabra, and Don\r\nAlonso Fernandez, senior of Alcaudrete and Montemayor, drew up their\r\nforces in battle array on the plain below the hamlet, presenting a\r\nliving barrier of loyal chivalry between the sovereigns and the city.\r\n\r\nThus securely guarded, the royal party alighted, and, entering one of\r\nthe houses of the hamlet which had been prepared for their reception,\r\nenjoyed a full view of the city from its terraced roof. The ladies of\r\nthe court gazed with delight at the red towers of the Alhambra rising\r\nfrom amid shady groves, anticipating the time when the Catholic\r\nsovereigns should be enthroned within its walls and its courts shine\r\nwith the splendor of Spanish chivalry. “The reverend prelates and holy\r\nfriars who always surrounded the queen looked with serene satisfaction,”\r\n says Fray Antonio Agapida, “at this modern Babylon, enjoying the triumph\r\nthat awaited them when those mosques and minarets should be converted\r\ninto churches, and goodly priests and bishops should succeed to the\r\ninfidel alfaquis.”\r\n\r\nWhen the Moors beheld the Christians thus drawn forth in full array in\r\nthe plain, they supposed it was to offer battle, and hesitated not to\r\naccept it. In a little while the queen beheld a body of Moorish cavalry\r\npouring into the Vega, the riders managing their fleet and fiery steeds\r\nwith admirable address. They were richly armed and clothed in the most\r\nbrilliant colors, and the caparisons of their steeds flamed with gold\r\nand embroidery. This was the favorite squadron of Muza, composed of\r\nthe flower of the youthful cavaliers of Granada. Others succeeded, some\r\nheavily armed, others “a la gineta” with lance and buckler, and lastly\r\ncame the legions of foot-soldiers with arquebuse and crossbow and spear\r\nand scimetar.\r\n\r\nWhen the queen saw this army issuing from the city she sent to\r\nthe marques of Cadiz, and forbade any attack upon the enemy or the\r\nacceptance of any challenge to a skirmish, for she was loth that her\r\ncuriosity should cost the life of a single human being.\r\n\r\nThe marques promised to obey, though sorely against his will, and it\r\ngrieved the spirit of the Spanish cavaliers to be obliged to remain\r\nwith sheathed sword’s while bearded by the foe. The Moors could not\r\ncomprehend the meaning of this inaction of the Christians after having\r\napparently invited a battle. They sallied several times from their\r\nranks, and approached near enough to discharge their arrows, but the\r\nChristians were immovable. Many of the Moorish horsemen galloped close\r\nto the Christian ranks, brandishing their lances and scimetars and\r\ndefying various cavaliers to single combat; but Ferdinand had rigorously\r\nprohibited all duels of the kind, and they dared not transgress his\r\norders under his very eye.\r\n\r\nHere, however, the worthy Fray Antonio Agapida, in his enthusiasm for\r\nthe triumphs of the faith, records the following incident, which we fear\r\nis not sustained by any grave chronicler of the times, but rests merely\r\non tradition or the authority of certain poets and dramatic writers\r\nwho have perpetuated the tradition in their works: While this grim and\r\nreluctant tranquillity prevailed along the Christian line, says Agapida,\r\nthere rose a mingled shout and sound of laughter near the gate of the\r\ncity. A Moorish horseman, armed at all points, issued forth, followed\r\nby a rabble who drew back as he approached the scene of danger. The\r\nMoor was more robust and brawny than was common with his countrymen.\r\nHis visor was closed; he bore a huge buckler and a ponderous lance; his\r\nscimetar was of a Damascus blade, and his richly ornamented dagger was\r\nwrought by an artificer of Fez. He was known by his device to be Tarfe,\r\nthe most insolent yet valiant of the Moslem warriors--the same who had\r\nhurled into the royal camp his lance inscribed to the queen. As he rode\r\nslowly along in front of the army his very steed, prancing with fiery\r\neye and distended nostril, seemed to breathe defiance to the Christians.\r\n\r\nBut what were the feelings of the Spanish cavaliers when they beheld,\r\ntied to the tail of his steed and dragged in the dust, the very\r\ninscription--“AVE MARIA”--which Hernan Perez del Pulgar had affixed to\r\nthe door of the mosque! A burst of horror and indignation broke\r\nforth from the army. Hernan was not at hand to maintain his previous\r\nachievement, but one of his young companions-in-arms, Garcilasso de\r\nla Vega by name, putting spurs to his horse, galloped to the hamlet\r\nof Zubia, threw himself on his knees before the king, and besought\r\npermission to accept the defiance of this insolent infidel and to\r\nrevenge the insult offered to our Blessed Lady. The request was too\r\npious to be refused. Garcilasso remounted his steed, closed his helmet,\r\ngraced by four sable plumes, grasped his buckler of Flemish workmanship\r\nand his lance of matchless temper, and defied the haughty Moor in the\r\nmidst of his career. A combat took place in view of the two armies and\r\nof the Castilian court. The Moor was powerful in wielding his weapons\r\nand dextrous in managing his steed. He was of larger frame than\r\nGarcilasso, and more completely armed, and the Christians trembled for\r\ntheir champion. The shock of their encounter was dreadful; their lances\r\nwere shivered, and sent up splinters in the air. Garcilasso was thrown\r\nback in his saddle: his horse made a wide career before he could\r\nrecover, gather up the reins, and return to the conflict. They now\r\nencountered each other with swords. The Moor circled round his opponent\r\nas a hawk circles where about to make a swoop; his steed obeyed his\r\nrider with matchless quickness; at every attack of the infidel it seemed\r\nas if the Christian knight must sink beneath his flashing scimetar. But\r\nif Garcilasso was inferior to him in power, he was superior in agility:\r\nmany of his blows he parried; others he received upon his Flemish\r\nshield, which was proof against the Damascus blade. The blood streamed\r\nfrom numerous wounds received by either warrior. The Moor, seeing\r\nhis antagonist exhausted, availed himself of his superior force, and,\r\ngrappling, endeavored to wrest him from his saddle. They both fell to\r\nearth: the Moor placed his knee upon the breast of his victim, and,\r\nbrandishing his dagger, aimed a blow at his throat. A cry of despair was\r\nuttered by the Christian warriors, when suddenly they beheld the Moor\r\nrolling lifeless in the dust. Garcilasso had shortened his sword, and as\r\nhis adversary raised his arm to strike had pierced him to the heart. “It\r\nwas a singular and miraculous victory,” says Fray Antonio Agapida; “but\r\nthe Christian knight was armed by the sacred nature of his cause, and\r\nthe Holy Virgin gave him strength, like another David, to slay this\r\ngigantic champion of the Gentiles.”\r\n\r\nThe laws of chivalry were observed throughout the combat--no one\r\ninterfered on either side. Garcilasso now despoiled his adversary;\r\nthen, rescuing the holy inscription of “AVE MARIA” from its degrading\r\nsituation, he elevated it on the point of his sword, and bore it on as a\r\nsignal of triumph amid the rapturous shouts of the Christian army.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * The above incident has been commemorated in old Spanish ballads,\r\nand made the subject of a scene in an old Spanish drama ascribed by some\r\nto Lope de Vega.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun had now reached the meridian, and the hot blood of the Moors was\r\ninflamed by its rays and by the sight of the defeat of their champion.\r\nMuza ordered two pieces of ordnance to open a fire upon the Christians.\r\nA confusion was produced in one part of their ranks: Muza called to the\r\nchiefs of the army, “Let us waste no more time in empty challenges--let\r\nus charge upon the enemy: he who assaults has always an advantage in the\r\ncombat.” So saying, he rushed forward, followed by a large body of\r\nhorse and foot, and charged so furiously upon the advance guard of the\r\nChristians that he drove it in upon the battalion of the marques of\r\nCadiz.\r\n\r\nThe gallant marques now considered himself absolved from all further\r\nobedience to the queen’s commands. He gave the signal to attack,\r\n“Santiago!” was shouted along the line, and he pressed forward to\r\nthe encounter with his battalion of twelve hundred lances. The other\r\ncavaliers followed his example, and the battle instantly became general.\r\n\r\nWhen the king and queen beheld the armies thus rushing to the combat,\r\nthey threw themselves on their knees and implored the Holy Virgin to\r\nprotect her faithful warriors. The prince and princess, the ladies of\r\nthe court, and the prelates and friars who were present did the same,\r\nand the effect of the prayers of these illustrious and saintly persons\r\nwas immediately apparent. The fierceness with which the Moors had rushed\r\nto the attack was suddenly cooled; they were bold and adroit for a\r\nskirmish, but unequal to the veteran Spaniards in the open field. A\r\npanic seized upon the foot-soldiers; they turned and took to flight.\r\nMuza and his cavaliers in vain endeavored to rally them. Some took\r\nrefuge in the mountains, but the greater part fled to the city in\r\nsuch confusion that they overturned and trampled upon each other. The\r\nChristians pursued them to the very gates. Upward of two thousand\r\nwere either killed, wounded, or taken prisoners, and the two pieces of\r\nordnance were brought off as trophies of the victory. Not a Christian\r\nlance but was bathed that day in the blood of an infidel.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Cura de los Palacios, cap. 101; Zurita, lib. 20, c. 88.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was the brief but bloody action which was known among the Christian\r\nwarriors by the name of “the Queen’s Skirmish;” for when the marques of\r\nCadiz waited upon Her Majesty to apologize for breaking her commands,\r\nhe attributed the victory entirely to her presence. The queen, however,\r\ninsisted that it was all owing to her troops being led on by so valiant\r\na commander. Her Majesty had not yet recovered from her agitation at\r\nbeholding so terrible a scene of bloodshed, though certain veterans\r\npresent pronounced it as gay and gentle a skirmish as they had ever\r\nwitnessed.\r\n\r\nThe gayety of this gentle pass at arms, however, was somewhat marred\r\nby a rough reverse in the evening. Certain of the Christian cavaliers,\r\namong whom were the count de Urena, Don Alonso Aguilar, his brother\r\nGonsalvo of Cordova, Diego Castrillo, commander of Calatrava, and others\r\nto the number of fifty, remained in ambush near Armilla, expecting the\r\nMoors would sally forth at night to visit the scene of battle and to\r\nbury their dead. They were discovered by a Moor who had climbed an elm\r\ntree to reconnoitre, and who hastened into the city to give notice\r\nof their ambush. Scarce had night fallen when the cavaliers found\r\nthemselves surrounded by a host which in the darkness seemed\r\ninnumerable. The Moors attacked them with sanguinary fury to revenge\r\nthe disgrace of the morning. The cavaliers fought to every disadvantage,\r\noverwhelmed by numbers, ignorant of the ground, perplexed by thickets\r\nand by the water-courses of the gardens, the sluices of which were\r\nall thrown open. Even retreat was difficult. The count de Urena was\r\nsurrounded and in imminent peril, from which he was saved by two of his\r\nfaithful followers at the sacrifice of their lives. Several\r\ncavaliers lost their horses, and were themselves put to death in the\r\nwater-courses. Gonsalvo of Cordova came near having his own illustrious\r\ncareer cut short in this obscure skirmish. He had fallen into a\r\nwater-course, whence he extricated himself, covered with mud and so\r\nencumbered with his armor that he could not retreat. Inigo de Mendoza, a\r\nrelative of his brother Alonso, seeing his peril, offered him his horse.\r\n“Take it, senor,” said he, “for you cannot save yourself on foot, and I\r\ncan; but should I fall take care of my wife and daughters.”\r\n\r\nGonsalvo accepted the devoted offer, mounted the horse, and had made\r\nbut few paces when a lamentable cry caused him to turn his head, and\r\nhe beheld the faithful Mendoza transfixed by Moorish lances. The four\r\nprincipal cavaliers already named, with several of their followers,\r\neffected their retreat and reached the camp in safety; but this\r\nnocturnal reverse obscured the morning’s triumph. Gonsalvo remembered\r\nthe last words of the devoted Mendoza, and bestowed a pension on his\r\nwidow and marriage portions on his daughters.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * The account of this nocturnal affair is from Peter Martyr, lib. 4,\r\nEpist. 90, and Pulgar, Hazanas del Gran Capitan, page 188, as cited by\r\nAlcantara, Hist. Granada, tom. 4, cap. 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo commemorate the victory of which she had been an eye-witness, Queen\r\nIsabella afterward erected a monastery in the village of Zubia dedicated\r\nto St. Francisco, which still exists, and in its garden is a laurel\r\nplanted by her hands.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * The house whence the king and queen contemplated the battle is\r\nlikewise to be seen at the present day. It is in the first street to\r\nthe right on entering the village from the Vega, and the royal arms are\r\npainted on the ceilings. It is inhabited by a worthy farmer, Francisco\r\nGarcia, who in showing the house to the writer refused all compensation\r\nwith true Spanish pride, offering, on the contrary, the hospitalities\r\nof his mansion. His children are versed in the old Spanish ballads about\r\nthe exploits of Hernan Perez del Pulgar and Garcilasso de la Vega.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCIV.\r\n\r\nTHE LAST RAVAGE BEFORE GRANADA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ravages of war had as yet spared a little portion of the Vega of\r\nGranada. A green belt of gardens and orchards still flourished round\r\nthe city, extending along the banks of the Xenil and the Darro. They had\r\nbeen the solace and delight of the inhabitants in their happier days,\r\nand contributed to their sustenance in this time of scarcity. Ferdinand\r\ndetermined to make a final and exterminating ravage to the very walls of\r\nthe city, so that there should not remain a single green thing for the\r\nsustenance of man or beast. The eighth of July was the day appointed\r\nfor this act of desolation. Boabdil was informed by his spies of the\r\nintention of the Christian king, and prepared to make a desperate\r\ndefence. Hernando de Baeza, a Christian who resided with the royal\r\nfamily in the Alhambra as interpreter, gives in a manuscript memoir an\r\naccount of the parting of Boabdil from his family as he went forth to\r\nbattle. At an early hour on the appointed day, the eighth of July, he\r\nbathed and perfumed himself, as the Moors of high rank were accustomed\r\nto do when they went forth to peril their lives. Arrayed in complete\r\narmor, he took leave of his mother, his wife, and his sister in the\r\nantechamber of the Tower of Comares. Ayxa la Horra, with her usual\r\ndignity, bestowed on him her benediction and gave him her hand to kiss.\r\nIt was a harder parting with his son and his daughter, who hung round\r\nhim with sobs and tears: the duenas and doncellas too of the\r\nroyal household made the halls of the Alhambra resound with their\r\nlamentations. He then mounted his horse and put himself in front of his\r\nsquadrons.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Hernando de Baeza, as cited by Alcantara, Hist. Gran., t. 4, c. 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Christian army approached close to the city, and were laying waste\r\nthe gardens and orchards when Boabdil sallied forth, surrounded by all\r\nthat was left of the flower and chivalry of Granada. There is one place\r\nwhere even the coward becomes brave--that sacred spot called home.\r\nWhat, then, must have been the valor of the Moors, a people always of\r\nchivalrous spirit, when the war was thus brought to their thresholds!\r\nThey fought among the scenes of their loves and pleasures, the scenes of\r\ntheir infancy, and the haunts of their domestic life. They fought\r\nunder the eyes of their wives and children, their old men and their\r\nmaidens--of all that was helpless and all that was dear to them; for all\r\nGranada, crowded on tower and battlement, watched with trembling heart\r\nthe fate of this eventful day.\r\n\r\nThere was not so much one battle as a variety of battles: every garden\r\nand orchard became a scene of deadly contest; every inch of ground was\r\ndisputed with an agony of grief and valor by the Moors; every inch of\r\nground that the Christians advanced they valiantly maintained, but never\r\ndid they advance with severer fighting or greater loss of blood.\r\n\r\nThe cavalry of Muza was in every part of the field; wherever it came it\r\ngave fresh ardor to the fight. The Moorish soldier, fainting with heat,\r\nfatigue, and wounds, was roused to new life at the approach of Muza; and\r\neven he who lay gasping in the agonies of death turned his face toward\r\nhim and faintly uttered cheers and blessings as he passed.\r\n\r\nThe Christians had by this time gained possession of various towers near\r\nthe city, whence they had been annoyed by crossbows and arquebuses. The\r\nMoors, scattered in various actions, were severely pressed. Boabdil, at\r\nthe head of the cavaliers of his guard, mingling in the fight in various\r\nparts of the field, endeavored to inspirit the foot-soldiers to the\r\ncombat. But the Moorish infantry was never to be depended upon. In the\r\nheat of the action a panic seized upon them; they fled, leaving their\r\nsovereign exposed with his handful of cavaliers to an overwhelming\r\nforce. Boabdil was on the point of falling into the hands of the\r\nChristians, when, wheeling round, he and his followers threw the reins\r\non the necks of their steeds and took refuge by dint of hoof within the\r\nwalls of the city.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Zurita, lib. 20, c. 88.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuza endeavored to retrieve the fortune of the field. He threw himself\r\nbefore the retreating infantry, calling upon them to turn and fight for\r\ntheir homes, their families, for everything sacred and dear to them.\r\nAll in vain: totally broken and dismayed, they fled tumultuously for the\r\ngates. Muza would fain have kept the field with his cavalry; but this\r\ndevoted band, having stood the brunt of war throughout this desperate\r\ncampaign, was fearfully reduced in numbers, and many of the survivors\r\nwere crippled and enfeebled by their wounds. Slowly and reluctantly,\r\ntherefore, he retreated to the city, his bosom swelling with indignation\r\nand despair. Entering the gates, he ordered them to be closed and\r\nsecured with bolts and bars; for he refused to place any further\r\nconfidence in the archers and arquebusiers stationed to defend them, and\r\nvowed never more to sally with foot-soldiers to the field.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the artillery thundered from the walls and checked all\r\nfurther advance of the Christians. King Ferdinand therefore called off\r\nhis troops, and returned in triumph to his camp, leaving the beautiful\r\ncity of Granada wrapped in the smoke of her fields and gardens and\r\nsurrounded by the bodies of her slaughtered children.\r\n\r\nSuch was the last sally of the Moors in defence of their favorite city.\r\nThe French ambassador, who witnessed it, was filled with wonder at the\r\nprowess, the dexterity, and the daring of the Moslems.\r\n\r\nIn truth, this whole war was an instance, memorable in history, of\r\nthe most persevering resolution. For nearly ten years had the war\r\nendured--an almost uninterrupted series of disasters to the Moorish\r\narms. Their towns had been taken, one after another, and their brethren\r\nslain or led into captivity. Yet they disputed every city and town\r\nand fortress and castle, nay, every rock itself, as if they had been\r\ninspirited by victories. Wherever they could plant foot to fight,\r\nor find wall or cliff whence to launch an arrow, they disputed their\r\nbeloved country; and now, when their capital was cut off from all\r\nrelief and a whole nation thundered at its gates, they still maintained\r\ndefence, as if they hoped some miracle to interpose in their behalf.\r\nTheir obstinate resistance (says an ancient chronicler) shows the grief\r\nwith which they yielded up the Vega, which was to them a paradise and\r\nheaven. Exerting all the strength of their arms, they embraced, as it\r\nwere, that most beloved soil, from which neither wounds nor defeats, nor\r\ndeath itself, could part them. They stood firm, battling for it with the\r\nunited force of love and grief, never drawing back the foot while they\r\nhad hands to fight or fortune to befriend them.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Abarca, Reyes de Aragon, R. 30, c. 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCV.\r\n\r\nCONFLAGRATION OF THE CHRISTIAN CAMP.--BUILDING OF SANTA FE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe moors now shut themselves up gloomily within their walls; there\r\nwere no longer any daring sallies from their gates, and even the martial\r\nclangor of the drum and trumpet, which had continually resounded within\r\nthe warrior city, was now seldom heard from its battlements. In the\r\nmidst of this deep despondency a single disaster in the Christian camp\r\nfor a moment lit up a ray of hope in the bosom of the Moors.\r\n\r\nThe setting sun of a hot summer’s day, on the 10th of July, shone\r\nsplendidly upon the Christian camp, which was in a bustle of preparation\r\nfor the next day’s service, when an attack was meditated on the city.\r\nThe camp made a glorious appearance. The various tents of the royal\r\nfamily and the attendant nobles were adorned with rich hangings and\r\nsumptuous devices and costly furniture, forming, as it were, a little\r\ncity of silk and brocade, where the pinnacles of pavilions of various\r\ngay colors, surmounted with waving standards and fluttering pennons,\r\nmight vie with the domes and minarets of the capital they were\r\nbesieging.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this little gaudy metropolis the lofty tent of the queen\r\ndomineered over the rest like a stately palace. The marques of Cadiz\r\nhad courteously surrendered his own tent to the queen: it was the most\r\ncomplete and sumptuous in Christendom, and had been carried about with\r\nhim throughout the war. In the centre rose a stately alfaneque, or\r\npavilion, in Oriental taste, the rich hangings being supported by\r\ncolumns of lances and ornamented with martial devices. This central\r\npavilion, or silken tower, was surrounded by other compartments, some\r\nof painted linen lined with silk, and all separated from each other\r\nby curtains. It was one of those camp palaces which are raised and\r\ndemolished in an instant like the city of canvas which surrounds them.\r\n\r\nAs the evening advanced the bustle in the camp subsided. Every one\r\nsought repose, preparatory to the next day’s trial. The king retired\r\nearly, that he might be up with the crowing of the cock to head the\r\ndestroying army in person. All stir of military preparation was hushed\r\nin the royal quarters: the very sound of minstrelsy was mute, and not\r\nthe tinkling of a guitar was to be heard from the tents of the fair\r\nladies of the court.\r\n\r\nThe queen had retired to the innermost part of her pavilion, where she\r\nwas performing her orisons before a private altar: perhaps the peril\r\nto which the king might be exposed in the next day’s foray inspired\r\nher with more than usual devotion. While thus at her prayers she was\r\nsuddenly aroused by a glare of light and wreaths of suffocating smoke.\r\nIn an instant the whole tent was in a blaze: there was a high gusty\r\nwind, which whirled the light flames from tent to tent and wrapped the\r\nwhole in one conflagration.\r\n\r\nIsabella had barely time to save herself by instant flight. Her first\r\nthought on being extricated from her tent was for the safety of the\r\nking. She rushed to his tent, but the vigilant Ferdinand was already at\r\nthe entrance of it. Starting from bed on the first alarm and fancying it\r\nan assault of the enemy, he had seized his sword and buckler and sallied\r\nforth undressed with his cuirass upon his arm.\r\n\r\nThe late gorgeous camp was now a scene of wild confusion. The flames\r\nkept spreading from one pavilion to another, glaring upon the rich armor\r\nand golden and silver vessels, which seemed melting in the fervent heat.\r\nMany of the soldiers had erected booths and bowers of branches, which,\r\nbeing dry, crackled and blazed and added to the rapid conflagration. The\r\nladies of the court fled, shrieking and half dressed, from their tents.\r\nThere was an alarm of drum and trumpet, and a distracted hurry about the\r\ncamp of men half armed. The prince Juan had been snatched out of bed by\r\nan attendant and conveyed to the quarters of the count de Cabra, which\r\nwere at the entrance of the camp. The loyal count immediately summoned\r\nhis people and those of his cousin Don Alonso de Montemayor, and formed\r\na guard round the tent in which the prince was sheltered.\r\n\r\nThe idea that this was a stratagem of the Moors soon subsided, but it\r\nwas feared they might take advantage of it to assault the camp. The\r\nmarques of Cadiz, therefore, sallied forth with three thousand horse to\r\ncheck any advance from the city. As they passed along the whole camp was\r\na scene of hurry and consternation--some hastening to their posts at\r\nthe call of drum and trumpet; some attempting to save rich effects and\r\nglittering armor from the tents; others dragging along terrified and\r\nrestive horses.\r\n\r\nWhen they emerged from the camp they found the whole firmament\r\nilluminated. The flames whirled up in long light spires, and the air was\r\nfilled with sparks and cinders. A bright glare was thrown upon the city,\r\nrevealing every battlement and tower. Turbaned heads were seen gazing\r\nfrom every roof, and armor gleamed along the walls, yet not a single\r\nwarrior sallied from the gates: the Moors suspected some stratagem\r\non the part of the Christians and kept quietly within their walls. By\r\ndegrees the flames expired; the city faded from sight; all again became\r\ndark and quiet, and the marques of Cadiz returned with his cavalry to\r\nthe camp.\r\n\r\nWhen the day dawned on the Christian camp nothing remained of that\r\nbeautiful assemblage of stately pavilions but heaps of smouldering\r\nrubbish, with helms and corselets and other furniture of war, and masses\r\nof melted gold and silver glittering among the ashes. The wardrobe\r\nof the queen was entirely destroyed, and there was an immense loss\r\nin plate, jewels, costly stuffs, and sumptuous armor of the luxurious\r\nnobles. The fire at first had been attributed to treachery, but on\r\ninvestigation it proved to be entirely accidental. The queen on retiring\r\nto her prayers had ordered her lady in attendance to remove a light\r\nburning near her couch, lest it should prevent her sleeping. Through\r\nheedlessness, the taper was placed in another part of the tent near the\r\nhangings, which, being blown against it by a gust of wind, immediately\r\ntook fire.\r\n\r\nThe wary Ferdinand knew the sanguine temperament of the Moors, and\r\nhastened to prevent their deriving confidence from the night’s disaster.\r\nAt break of day the drums and trumpets sounded to arms, and the\r\nChristian army issued forth from among the smoking ruins of their camp\r\nin shining squadrons, with flaunting banners and bursts of martial\r\nmelody, as though the preceding night had been a time of high festivity\r\ninstead of terror.\r\n\r\nThe Moors had beheld the conflagration with wonder and perplexity.\r\nWhen the day broke and they looked toward the Christian camp, they saw\r\nnothing but a dark smoking mass. Their scouts came in with the joyful\r\nintelligence that the whole camp was a scene of ruin. In the exultation\r\nof the moment they flattered themselves with hopes that the catastrophe\r\nwould discourage the besiegers--that, as in former years, their invasion\r\nwould end with the summer and they would withdraw before the autumnal\r\nrains.\r\n\r\nThe measures of Ferdinand and Isabella soon crushed these hopes. They\r\ngave orders to build a regular city upon the site of their camp, to\r\nconvince the Moors that the siege was to endure until the surrender of\r\nGranada. Nine of the principal cities of Spain were charged with the\r\nstupendous undertaking, and they emulated each other with a zeal worthy\r\nof the cause. “It verily seems,” says Fray Antonio Agapida, “as though\r\nsome miracle operated to aid this pious work, so rapidly did arise\r\na formidable city, with solid edifices and powerful walls and mighty\r\ntowers, where lately had been seen nothing but tents and light\r\npavilions. The city was traversed by two principal streets in form of\r\na cross, terminating in four gates facing the four winds, and in the\r\ncentre was a vast square where the whole army might be assembled. To\r\nthis city it was proposed to give the name of Isabella, so dear to the\r\narmy and the nation, but that pious princess,” adds Antonio Agapida,\r\n“calling to mind the holy cause in which it was erected, gave it the\r\nname of Santa Fe (or the City of the Holy Faith), and it remains to this\r\nday a monument of the piety and glory of the Catholic sovereigns.”\r\n\r\nHither the merchants soon resorted from all points. Long trains of mules\r\nwere seen every day entering and departing from its gates; the streets\r\nwere crowded with magazines filled with all kinds of costly and\r\nluxurious merchandise; a scene of bustling commerce and prosperity took\r\nplace, while unhappy Granada remained shut up and desolate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCVI.\r\n\r\nFAMINE AND DISCORD IN THE CITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe besieged city now began to suffer the distress of famine. Its\r\nsupplies were all cut off; a cavalgada of flocks and herds and mules\r\nladen with money, coming to the relief of the city from the mountains of\r\nthe Alpuxarras, was taken by the marques of Cadiz and led in triumph\r\nto the camp in sight of the suffering Moors. Autumn arrived, but the\r\nharvests had been swept from the face of the country; a rigorous winter\r\nwas approaching and the city was almost destitute of provisions. The\r\npeople sank into deep despondency. They called to mind all that had been\r\npredicted by astrologers at the birth of their ill-starred sovereign,\r\nand all that had been foretold of the fate of Granada at the time of the\r\ncapture of Zahara.\r\n\r\nBoabdil was alarmed by the gathering dangers from without and by the\r\nclamors of his starving people. He summoned a council, composed of the\r\nprincipal officers of the army, the alcaydes of the fortresses, the\r\nxequis or sages of the city, and the alfaquis or doctors of the faith.\r\nThey assembled in the great Hall of Audience of the Alhambra, and\r\ndespair was painted in their countenances. Boabdil demanded of them\r\nwhat was to be done in the present extremity, and their answer was,\r\n“Surrender.” The venerable Abul Casim, governor of the city, represented\r\nits unhappy state: “Our granaries are nearly exhausted, and no further\r\nsupplies are to be expected. The provender for the war-horses is\r\nrequired as sustenance for the soldiery; the very horses themselves are\r\nkilled for food; of seven thousand steeds which once could be sent into\r\nthe field, three hundred only remain. Our city contains two hundred\r\nthousand inhabitants, old and young, with each a mouth that calls\r\npiteously for bread.”\r\n\r\nThe xequis and principal citizens declared that the people could no\r\nlonger sustain the labors and sufferings of a defence. “And of what\r\navail is our defence,” said they, “when the enemy is determined to\r\npersist in the siege? What alternative remains but to surrender or to\r\ndie?”\r\n\r\nThe heart of Boabdil was touched by this appeal, and he maintained a\r\ngloomy silence. He had cherished some faint hope of relief from the\r\nsoldan of Egypt or the Barbary powers, but it was now at an end; even\r\nif such assistance were to be sent, he had no longer a seaport where it\r\nmight debark. The counsellors saw that the resolution of the king was\r\nshaken, and they united their voices in urging him to capitulate.\r\n\r\nMuza alone rose in opposition. “It is yet too early,” said he, “to talk\r\nof surrender. Our means are not exhausted; we have yet one source\r\nof strength remaining, terrible in its effects, and which often has\r\nachieved the most signal victories--it is our despair. Let us rouse the\r\nmass of the people--let us put weapons in their hands--let us fight the\r\nenemy to the very utmost until we rush upon the points of their lances.\r\nI am ready to lead the way into the thickest of their squadrons; and\r\nmuch rather would I be numbered among those who fell in the defence of\r\nGranada than of those who survived to capitulate for her surrender.”\r\n\r\nThe words of Muza were without effect, for they were addressed to\r\nbroken-spirited and heartless men, or men, perhaps, to whom sad\r\nexperience had taught discretion. They were arrived at that state of\r\npublic depression when heroes and heroism are no longer regarded, and\r\nwhen old men and their counsels rise into importance. Boabdil el Chico\r\nyielded to the general voice: it was determined to capitulate with the\r\nChristian sovereigns, and the venerable Abul Casim was sent forth to the\r\ncamp empowered to treat for terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCVII.\r\n\r\nCAPITULATION OF GRANADA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old governor Abul Casim was received with great courtesy by\r\nFerdinand and Isabella, who, being informed of the purport of his\r\nembassy, granted the besieged a truce of sixty days from the 5th of\r\nOctober, and appointed Gonsalvo of Cordova and Hernando de Zafra, the\r\nsecretary of the king, to treat about the terms of surrender with such\r\ncommissioners as might be named by Boabdil. The latter on his part named\r\nAbul Casim, Aben Comixa the vizier, and the grand cadi. As a pledge of\r\ngood faith Boabdil gave his son in hostage, who was taken to Moclin,\r\nwhere he was treated with the greatest respect and attention by the good\r\ncount de Tendilla as general of the frontier.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners on both parts held repeated conferences in secret\r\nin the dead of the night at the village of Churriana, those who\r\nfirst arrived at the place of meeting giving notice to the others\r\nby signal-fires or by means of spies. After many debates and much\r\ndifficulty the capitulation was signed on the 25th of November.\r\nAccording to this, the city was to be delivered up, with all its gates,\r\ntowers and fortresses, within sixty days.\r\n\r\nAll Christian captives should be liberated without ransom.\r\n\r\nBoabdil and his principal cavaliers should perform the act of homage and\r\ntake an oath of fealty to the Castilian Crown.\r\n\r\nThe Moors of Granada should become subjects of the Spanish sovereigns,\r\nretaining their possessions, their arms and horses, and yielding up\r\nnothing but their artillery. They should be protected in the exercise of\r\ntheir religion, and governed by their own laws, administered by cadis of\r\ntheir own faith under governors appointed by the sovereigns. They should\r\nbe exempted from tribute for three years, after which term they should\r\npay the same that they had been accustomed to render to their native\r\nmonarchs.\r\n\r\nThose who chose to depart for Africa within three years should be\r\nprovided with a passage for themselves and their effects, free of\r\ncharge, from whatever port they should prefer.\r\n\r\nFor the fulfilment of these articles five hundred hostages from the\r\nprincipal families were required previous to the surrender, who should\r\nbe treated with great respect and distinction by the Christians, and\r\nsubsequently restored. The son of the king of Granada and all other\r\nhostages in possession of the Castilian sovereigns were to be restored\r\nat the same time.\r\n\r\nSuch are the main articles affecting the public weal which were agreed\r\nupon, after much discussion, by the mixed commission. There were other\r\narticles, however, secretly arranged, which concerned the royal family.\r\nThese secured to Boabdil, to his wife Morayma, his mother Ayza, his\r\nbrothers, and to Zoraya, the widow of Muley Abul Hassan, all the landed\r\npossessions, houses, mills, baths, and other hereditaments which formed\r\nthe royal patrimony, with the power of selling them, personally or\r\nby agent, at any and all times. To Boabdil was secured, moreover,\r\nhis wealthy estates both in and out of Granada, and to him and his\r\ndescendants in perpetuity the lordships of various town and lands and\r\nfertile valleys in the Alpuxarras, forming a petty sovereignty. In\r\naddition to all which it was stipulated that on the day of surrender he\r\nshould receive thirty thousand castelanos of gold.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Alcantara, t. 4, c. 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conditions of surrender being finally agreed upon by the\r\ncommissioners, Abul Casim proceeded to the royal camp at Santa Fe, where\r\nthey were signed by Ferdinand and Isabella; he then returned to Granada,\r\naccompanied by Hernando de Zafra, the royal secretary, to have the same\r\nratified also by the Moorish king. Boabdil assembled his council, and\r\nwith a dejected countenance laid before it the articles of capitulation\r\nas the best that could be obtained from the besieging foe.\r\n\r\nWhen the members of the council found the awful moment arrived when they\r\nwere to sign and seal the perdition of their empire and blot themselves\r\nout as a nation, all firmness deserted them, and many gave way to tears.\r\nMuza alone retained an unaltered mien. “Leave, seniors,” cried he, “this\r\nidle lamentation to helpless women and children: we are men--we have\r\nhearts, not to shed tender tears, but drops of blood. I see the spirit\r\nof the people so cast down that it is impossible to save the kingdom.\r\nYet there still remains an alternative for noble minds--a glorious\r\ndeath! Let us die defending our liberty and avenging the woes of\r\nGranada. Our mother earth will receive her children into her bosom, safe\r\nfrom the chains and oppressions of the conqueror, or, should any fail\r\na sepulchre to hide his remains, he will not want a sky to cover him.\r\nAllah forbid it should be said the nobles of Granada feared to die in\r\nher defence!”\r\n\r\nMuza ceased to speak, and a dead silence reigned in the assembly.\r\nBoabdil looked anxiously round and scanned every face, but he read in\r\nall the anxiety of careworn men, in whose hearts enthusiasm was dead\r\nand who had grown callous to every chivalrous appeal. “Allah Akbar!”\r\n exclaimed he; “there is no God but God, and Mahomet is his prophet! We\r\nhave no longer forces in the city and the kingdom to resist our powerful\r\nenemies. It is in vain to struggle against the will of Heaven. Too\r\nsurely was it written in the book of fate that I should be unfortunate\r\nand the kingdom expire under my rule.”\r\n\r\n“Allah Akbar!” echoed the viziers and alfaquis; “the will of God\r\nbe done!” So they all agreed with the king that these evils were\r\npreordained, that it was hopeless to contend with them, and that the\r\nterms offered by the Castilian monarchs were as favorable as could be\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nWhen Muza heard them assent to the treaty of surrender he rose in\r\nviolent indignation. “Do not deceive yourselves,” cried he, “nor think\r\nthe Christians will be faithful to their promises, or their king as\r\nmagnanimous in conquest as he has been victorious in war. Death is the\r\nleast we have to fear. It is the plundering and sacking of our city, the\r\nprofanation of our mosques, the ruin of our homes, the violation of our\r\nwives and daughters, cruel oppression, bigoted intolerance, whips and\r\nchains, the dungeon, the fagot, and the stake: such are the miseries\r\nand indignities we shall see and suffer; at least those grovelling souls\r\nwill see and suffer them who now shrink from an honorable death. For my\r\npart, by Allah, I will never witness them!”\r\n\r\nWith these words he left the council-chamber, and passed gloomily\r\nthrough the Court of Lions and the outer halls of the Alhambra without\r\ndeigning to speak to the obsequious courtiers who attended in them.\r\nHe repaired to his dwelling, armed himself at all points, mounted his\r\nfavorite warhorse, and, issuing from the city by the gate of Elvira, was\r\nnever seen or heard of more.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Conde, part 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCVIII.\r\n\r\nCOMMOTIONS IN GRANADA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe capitulation for the surrender of Granada was signed on the 25th\r\nof November, 1481, and produced a sudden cessation of those hostilities\r\nwhich had raged for so many years. Christian and Moor might now be seen\r\nmingling courteously on the banks of the Xenil and the Darro, where to\r\nhave met a few days previous would have produced a scene of sanguinary\r\ncontest. Still, as the Moors might be suddenly roused to the defence\r\nif within the allotted term of sixty days succors should arrive from\r\nabroad, and as they were at all times a rash, inflammable people, the\r\nwary Ferdinand maintained a vigilant watch upon the city and permitted\r\nno supplies of any kind to enter. His garrisons in the seaports and\r\nhis cruisers in the Straits of Gibraltar were ordered likewise to guard\r\nagainst any relief from the grand soldan of Egypt or the princes of\r\nBarbary. There was no need of such precautions. Those powers were either\r\ntoo much engrossed by their own wars or too much daunted by the\r\nsuccess of the Spanish arms to interfere in a desperate cause, and the\r\nunfortunate Moors of Granada were abandoned to their fate.\r\n\r\nThe month of December had nearly passed away: the famine became extreme,\r\nand there was no hope of any favorable event within the term specified\r\nin the capitulation. Boabdil saw that to hold out to the end of the\r\nallotted time would but be to protract the miseries of his people. With\r\nthe consent of his council he determined to surrender the city on the\r\nsixth of January. He accordingly sent his grand vizier, Yusef Aben\r\nComixa, to King Ferdinand to make known his intention, bearing him,\r\nat the same time, a present of a magnificent scimetar and two Arabian\r\nsteeds superbly caparisoned.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Boabdil was doomed to meet with trouble to the end of\r\nhis career. The very next day the santon or dervise, Hamet Aben Zarrax,\r\nthe same who had uttered prophecies and excited commotions on former\r\noccasions, suddenly made his appearance. Whence he came no one knew: it\r\nwas rumored that he had been in the mountains of the Alpuxarras and on\r\nthe coast of Barbary endeavoring to rouse the Moslems to the relief of\r\nGranada. He was reduced to a skeleton; his eyes glowed like coals in\r\ntheir sockets, and his speech was little better than frantic raving. He\r\nharangued the populace in the streets and squares, inveighed against the\r\ncapitulation, denounced the king and nobles as Moslems only in name, and\r\ncalled upon the people to sally forth against the unbelievers, for that\r\nAllah had decreed them a signal victory.\r\n\r\nUpward of twenty thousand of the populace seized their arms and paraded\r\nthe streets with shouts and outcries. The shops and houses were shut up;\r\nthe king himself did not dare to venture forth, but remained a kind of\r\nprisoner in the Alhambra.\r\n\r\nThe turbulent multitude continued roaming and shouting and howling about\r\nthe city during the day and a part of the night. Hunger and a wintry\r\ntempest tamed their frenzy, and when morning came the enthusiast who\r\nhad led them on had disappeared. Whether he had been disposed of by the\r\nemissaries of the king or by the leading men of the city is not known:\r\nhis disappearance remains a mystery.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Mariana.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoabdil now issued from the Alhambra, attended by his principal nobles,\r\nand harangued the populace. He set forth the necessity of complying with\r\nthe capitulation, from the famine that reigned in the city, the futility\r\nof defence, and from the hostages having already been delivered into the\r\nhands of the besiegers.\r\n\r\nIn the dejection of his spirits the unfortunate Boabdil attributed to\r\nhimself the miseries of the country. “It was my crime in ascending the\r\nthrone in rebellion against my father,” said he, mournfully, “which has\r\nbrought these woes upon the kingdom; but Allah has grievously visited\r\nmy sins upon my head. For your sake, my people, I have now made this\r\ntreaty, to protect you from the sword, your little ones from famine,\r\nyour wives and daughters from outrage, and to secure you in the\r\nenjoyment of your properties, your liberties, your laws, and your\r\nreligion under a sovereign of happier destinies than the ill-starred\r\nBoabdil.”\r\n\r\nThe versatile population were touched by the humility of their\r\nsovereign: they agreed to adhere to the capitulation, and there was\r\neven a faint shout of “Long live Boabdil the Unfortunate!” and they all\r\nreturned to their homes in perfect tranquillity.\r\n\r\nBoabdil immediately sent missives to King Ferdinand apprising him of\r\nthese events, and of his fears lest further delay should produce new\r\ntumults. The vizier, Yusef Aben Comixa, was again the agent between\r\nthe monarchs. He was received with unusual courtesy and attention\r\nby Ferdinand and Isabella, and it was arranged between them that the\r\nsurrender should take place on the second day of January, instead of\r\nthe sixth. A new difficulty now arose in regard to the ceremonial of\r\nsurrender. The haughty Ayxa la Horra, whose pride rose with the decline\r\nof her fortunes, declared that as sultana-mother she would never consent\r\nthat her son should stoop to the humiliation of kissing the hand of his\r\nconquerors, and unless this part of the ceremonial were modified she\r\nwould find means to resist a surrender accompanied by such indignities.\r\n\r\nAben Comixa was sorely troubled by this opposition. He knew the high\r\nspirit of the indomitable Ayxa and her influence over her less heroic\r\nson, and wrote an urgent letter on the subject to his friend, the count\r\nde Tendilla. The latter imparted the circumstance to the Christian\r\nsovereigns; a council was called on the matter. Spanish pride and\r\netiquette were obliged to bend in some degree to the haughty spirit of a\r\nwoman. It was agreed that Boabdil should sally forth on horseback--that\r\non approaching the Spanish sovereigns he should make a slight movement,\r\nas if about to draw his foot from the stirrup and dismount, but would\r\nbe prevented from doing so by Ferdinand, who should treat him with a\r\nrespect due to his dignity and elevated birth. The count de Tendilla\r\ndespatched a messenger with this arrangement, and the haughty scruples\r\nof Ayxa la Horra were satisfied.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Salazar de Mendoza, Chron. del Gran Cardinal, lib. 1, c. 69, p. 1;\r\nMondajar, His. MS., as cited by Alcantara, t. 4, c. 18.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCIX.\r\n\r\nSURRENDER OF GRANADA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night preceding the surrender was a night of doleful lamentings\r\nwithin the walls of the Alhambra, for the household of Boabdil were\r\npreparing to take a last farewell of that delightful abode. All the\r\nroyal treasures and most precious effects were hastily packed upon\r\nmules; the beautiful apartments were despoiled, with tears and wailings,\r\nby their own inhabitants. Before the dawn of day a mournful cavalcade\r\nmoved obscurely out of a postern gate of the Alhambra and departed\r\nthrough one of the most retired quarters of the city. It was composed of\r\nthe family of the unfortunate Boabdil, which he sent off thus privately,\r\nthat they might not be exposed to the eyes of scoffers or the exultation\r\nof the enemy. The mother of Boabdil, the sultana Ayxa la Horra, rode on\r\nin silence, with dejected yet dignified demeanor; but his wife Morayma\r\nand all the females of his household gave way to loud lamentations as\r\nthey looked back upon their favorite abode, now a mass of gloomy\r\ntowers behind them. They were attended by the ancient domestics of the\r\nhousehold, and by a small guard of veteran Moors loyally attached to the\r\nfallen monarch, and who would have sold their lives dearly in defence of\r\nhis family. The city was yet buried in sleep as they passed through its\r\nsilent streets. The guards at the gate shed tears as they opened it for\r\ntheir departure. They paused not, but proceeded along the banks of the\r\nXenil on the road that leads to the Alpuxarras, until they arrived at\r\na hamlet at some distance from the city, where they halted and waited\r\nuntil they should be joined by King Boabdil. The night which had passed\r\nso gloomily in the sumptuous halls of the Alhambra had been one of\r\njoyful anticipation in the Christian camp. In the evening proclamation\r\nhad been made that Granada was to be surrendered on the following day,\r\nand the troops were all ordered to assemble at an early hour under their\r\nseveral banners. The cavaliers, pages, and esquires were all charged\r\nto array themselves in their richest and most splendid style for the\r\noccasion, and even the royal family determined to lay by the mourning\r\nthey had recently assumed for the sudden death of the prince of\r\nPortugal, the husband of the princess Isabella. In a clause of the\r\ncapitulation it had been stipulated that the troops destined to take\r\npossession should not traverse the city, but should ascend to the\r\nAlhambra by a road opened for the purpose outside of the walls. This was\r\nto spare the feelings of the afflicted inhabitants, and to prevent\r\nany angry collision between them and their conquerors. So rigorous was\r\nFerdinand in enforcing this precaution that the soldiers were prohibited\r\nunder pain of death from leaving the ranks to enter into the city.\r\n\r\nThe rising sun had scarce shed his rosy beams upon the snowy summits of\r\nthe Sierra Nevada when three signal guns boomed heavily from the lofty\r\nfortress of the Alhambra. It was the concerted sign that all was ready\r\nfor the surrender. The Christian army forthwith poured out of the city,\r\nor rather camp, of Santa Fe, and advanced across the Vega. The king and\r\nqueen, with the prince and princess, the dignitaries and ladies of the\r\ncourt, took the lead, accompanied by the different orders of monks\r\nand friars, and surrounded by the royal guards splendidly arrayed. The\r\nprocession moved slowly forward, and paused at the village of Armilla,\r\nat the distance of half a league from the city.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the grand cardinal of Spain, Don Pedro Gonzalez de\r\nMendoza, escorted by three thousand foot and a troop of cavalry, and\r\naccompanied by the commander Don Gutierrez de Cardenas and a number of\r\nprelates and hidalgos, crossed the Xenil and proceeded in the advance\r\nto ascend to the Alhambra and take possession of that royal palace and\r\nfortress. The road which had been opened for the purpose led by the\r\nPuerta de los Molinos, or Gate of Mills, up a defile to the esplanade\r\non the summit of the Hill of Martyrs. At the approach of this detachment\r\nthe Moorish king sallied forth from a postern gate of the Alhambra,\r\nhaving left his vizier, Yusef Aben Comixa, to deliver up the palace. The\r\ngate by which he sallied passed through a lofty tower of the outer\r\nwall, called the Tower of the Seven Floors (de los siete suelos). He\r\nwas accompanied by fifty cavaliers, and approached the grand cardinal on\r\nfoot. The latter immediately alighted, and advanced to meet him with\r\nthe utmost respect. They stepped aside a few paces, and held a brief\r\nconversation in an under tone, when Boabdil, raising his voice,\r\nexclaimed, “Go, senor, and take possession of those fortresses in the\r\nname of the powerful sovereigns to whom God has been pleased to deliver\r\nthem in reward of their great merits and in punishment of the sins of\r\nthe Moors.” The grand cardinal sought to console him in his reverses,\r\nand offered him the use of his own tent during any time he might sojourn\r\nin the camp. Boabdil thanked him for the courteous offer, adding some\r\nwords of melancholy import, and then, taking leave of him gracefully,\r\npassed mournfully on to meet the Catholic sovereigns, descending to the\r\nVega by the same road by which the cardinal had come. The latter, with\r\nthe prelates and cavaliers who attended him, entered the Alhambra, the\r\ngates of which were thrown wide open by the alcayde Aben Comixa. At the\r\nsame time the Moorish guards yielded up their arms, and the towers and\r\nbattlements were taken possession of by the Christian troops.\r\n\r\nWhile these transactions were passing in the Alhambra and its vicinity\r\nthe sovereigns remained with their retinue and guards near the village\r\nof Armilla, their eyes fixed on the towers of the royal fortress,\r\nwatching for the appointed signal of possession. The time that had\r\nelapsed since the departure of the detachment seemed to them more than\r\nnecessary for the purpose, and the anxious mind of Ferdinand began to\r\nentertain doubts of some commotion in the city. At length they saw the\r\nsilver cross, the great standard of this crusade, elevated on the Torre\r\nde la Vela, or Great Watch-tower, and sparkling in the sunbeams. This\r\nwas done by Hernando de Talavera, bishop of Avila. Beside it was planted\r\nthe pennon of the glorious apostle St. James, and a great shout of\r\n“Santiago! Santiago!” rose throughout the army. Lastly was reared the\r\nroyal standard by the king-at-arms, with the shout of “Castile! Castile!\r\nfor King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella!” The words were echoed by the\r\nwhole army, with acclamations that resounded across the Vega. At sight\r\nof these signals of possession the sovereigns sank upon their knees,\r\ngiving thanks to God for this great triumph; the whole assembled host\r\nfollowed their example, and the choristers of the royal chapel broke\r\nforth into the solemn anthem of “Te Deum laudamus.”\r\n\r\nThe king now advanced with a splendid escort of cavalry and the sound of\r\ntrumpets, until he came to a small mosque near the banks of the Xenil,\r\nand not far from the foot of the Hill of Martyrs, which edifice remains\r\nto the present day consecrated as the hermitage of St. Sebastian. Here\r\nhe beheld the unfortunate king of Granada approaching on horseback at\r\nthe head of his slender retinue. Boabdil as he drew near made a movement\r\nto dismount, but, as had previously been concerted, Ferdinand prevented\r\nhim. He then offered to kiss the king’s hand, which according to\r\narrangement was likewise declined, whereupon he leaned forward and\r\nkissed the king’s right arm; at the same time he delivered the keys\r\nof the city with an air of mingled melancholy and resignation. “These\r\nkeys,” said he, “are the last relics of the Arabian empire in Spain:\r\nthine, O king, are our trophies, our kingdom, and our person. Such is\r\nthe will of God! Receive them with the clemency thou hast promised, and\r\nwhich we look for at thy hands.” *\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Abarca, Anales de Aragon, Rey 30, c. 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nKing Ferdinand restrained his exultation into an air of serene\r\nmagnanimity. “Doubt not our promises,” replied he, “nor that thou shalt\r\nregain from our friendship the prosperity of which the fortune of war\r\nhas deprived thee.”\r\n\r\nBeing informed that Don Inigo Lopez de Mendoza, the good count of\r\nTendilla, was to be governor of the city, Boabdil drew from his finger a\r\ngold ring set with a precious stone and presented it to the count. “With\r\nthis ring,” said he, “Granada has been governed; take it and govern with\r\nit, and God make you more fortunate than I!”*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * This ring remained in the possession of the descendants of the\r\ncount until the death of the marques Don Inigo, the last male heir,\r\nwho died in Malaga, without children, in 1656. The ring was then lost\r\nthrough inadvertence and ignorance of its value, Dona Maria, the sister\r\nof the marques, being absent in Madrid--“Alcantara,” 1. 4, c.18.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe then proceeded to the village of Armilla, where the queen Isabella\r\nremained with her escort and attendants. The queen, like her husband,\r\ndeclined all acts of homage, and received him with her accustomed grace\r\nand benignity. She at the same time delivered to him his son, who had\r\nbeen held as a hostage for the fulfilment of the capitulation. Boabdil\r\npressed his child to his bosom with tender emotion, and they seemed\r\nmutually endeared to each other by their misfortunes.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Zurita, Anales de Aragon, lib. 20, cap. 92.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving rejoined his family, the unfortunate Boabdil continued on toward\r\nthe Alpuxarras, that he might not behold the entrance of the Christians\r\ninto his capital. His devoted band of cavaliers followed him in gloomy\r\nsilence, but heavy sighs burst from their bosoms as shouts of joy and\r\nstrains of triumphant music were borne on the breeze from the victorious\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nHaving rejoined his family, Boabdil set forth with a heavy heart for his\r\nallotted residence in the valley of Purchena. At two leagues’ distance\r\nthe cavalcade, winding into the skirts of the Alpuxarras, ascended an\r\neminence commanding the last view of Granada. As they arrived at this\r\nspot the Moors paused involuntarily to take a farewell gaze at their\r\nbeloved city, which a few steps more would shut from their sight for\r\never. Never had it appeared so lovely in their eyes. The sunshine, so\r\nbright in that transparent climate, lit up each tower and minaret, and\r\nrested gloriously upon the crowning battlements of the Alhambra, while\r\nthe Vega spread its enamelled bosom of verdure below, glistening with\r\nthe silver windings of the Xenil. The Moorish cavaliers gazed with a\r\nsilent agony of tenderness and grief upon that delicious abode, the\r\nscene of their loves and pleasures. While they yet looked a light\r\ncloud of smoke burst forth from the citadel, and presently a peal of\r\nartillery, faintly heard, told that the city was taken possession of,\r\nand the throne of the Moslem kings was lost for ever. The heart of\r\nBoabdil, softened by misfortunes and overcharged with grief, could no\r\nlonger contain itself. “Allah Akbar! God is great!” said he but the\r\nwords of resignation died upon his lips and he burst into tears.\r\n\r\nThe mother, the intrepid Ayxa, was indignant at his weakness. “You do\r\nwell,” said she, “to weep like a woman for what you failed to defend\r\nlike a man.”\r\n\r\nThe vizier Aben Comixa endeavored to console his royal master.\r\n“Consider, senor,” said he, “that the most signal misfortunes often\r\nrender men as renowned as the most prosperous achievements, provided\r\nthey sustain them with magnanimity.”\r\n\r\nThe unhappy monarch, however, was not to be consoled; his tears\r\ncontinued to flow. “Allah Akbar!” exclaimed he, “when did misfortune\r\never equal mine?”\r\n\r\nFrom this circumstance the hill, which is not far from Padul, took\r\nthe name of Feg Allah Akbar, but the point of view commanding the last\r\nprospect of Granada is known among Spaniards by the name of “El ultimo\r\nsuspiro del Moro,” or “The last sigh of the Moor.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER C.\r\n\r\nHOW THE CASTILIAN SOVEREIGNS TOOK POSSESSION OF GRANADA.\r\n\r\n\r\nQueen Isabella having joined the king, the royal pair, followed by a\r\ntriumphant host, passed up the road by the Hill of Martyrs, and thence\r\nto the main entrance of the Alhambra. The grand cardinal awaited them\r\nunder the lofty arch of the great Gate of Justice, accompanied by Don\r\nGutierrez de Cardenas and Aben Comixa. Here King Ferdinand gave the keys\r\nwhich had been delivered up to him into the hands of the queen; they\r\nwere passed successively into the hands of the prince Juan, the grand\r\ncardinal, and finally into those of the count de Tendilla, in whose\r\ncustody they remained, that brave cavalier having been named alcayde of\r\nthe Alhambra and captain-general of Granada.\r\n\r\nThe sovereigns did not remain long in the Alhambra on this first visit,\r\nbut, leaving a strong garrison there under the count de Tendilla to\r\nmaintain tranquillity in the palace and the subjacent city, returned to\r\nthe camp at Santa Fe.\r\n\r\nWe must not omit to mention a circumstance attending the surrender of\r\nthe city which spoke eloquently to the hearts of the victors. As the\r\nroyal army had advanced in all the pomp of courtly and chivalrous\r\narray, a procession of a different kind came forth to meet it. This was\r\ncomposed of more than five hundred Christian captives, many of whom had\r\nlanguished for years in Moorish dungeons. Pale and emaciated, they came\r\nclanking their chains in triumph and shedding tears of joy. They were\r\nreceived with tenderness by the sovereigns. The king hailed them as good\r\nSpaniards, as men loyal and brave, as martyrs to the holy cause; the\r\nqueen distributed liberal relief among them with her own hands, and they\r\npassed on before the squadrons of the army singing hymns of jubilee.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Abarca, lib. sup.; Zurita, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sovereigns forebore to enter the city until it should be fully\r\noccupied by their troops and public tranquillity ensured. All this\r\nwas done under the vigilant superintendence of the count de Tendilla,\r\nassisted by the marques of Villena, and the glistening of Christian\r\nhelms and lances along the walls and bulwarks, and the standards of\r\nthe faith and of the realm daunting from the towers, told that the\r\nsubjugation of the city was complete. The proselyte prince, Cid Hiaya,\r\nnow known by the Christian appellation of Don Pedro de Granada Vanegas,*\r\nwas appointed chief alguazil of the city, and had charge of the Moorish\r\ninhabitants, and his son, lately the prince Alnayar, now Alonso de\r\nGranada Vanegas, was appointed admiral of the fleet.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Cid Hiaya was made cavalier of the order of Santiago.  He and his\r\nson intermarried with the Spanish nobility, and the marqueses of\r\nCompotejar are among their descendants. Their portraits and the\r\nportraits of their grandsons are to be seen in one of the rooms of the\r\nGeneralife at Granada.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was on the sixth of January, the Day of Kings and festival of the\r\nEpiphany, that the sovereigns made their triumphant entry with grand\r\nmilitary parade. First advanced, we are told, a splendid escort of\r\ncavaliers in burnished armor and superbly mounted. Then followed the\r\nprince Juan, glittering with jewels and diamonds; on each side of him,\r\nmounted on mules, rode the grand cardinal, clothed in purple, Fray\r\nHernando de Talavera, bishop of Airla and the archbishop-elect of\r\nGranada. To these succeeded the queen and her ladies, and the king,\r\nmanaging in galliard style, say the Spanish chroniclers, a proud and\r\nmettlesome steed (un caballo arrogante). Then followed the army in\r\nshining columns, with flaunting banners and the inspiring clamor\r\nof military music. The king and queen (says the worthy Fray Antonio\r\nAgapida) looked on this occasion as more than mortal: the venerable\r\necclesiastics, to whose advice and zeal this glorious conquest ought\r\nin a great measure be attributed, moved along with hearts swelling\r\nwith holy exultation, but with chastened and downcast looks of edifying\r\nhumility; while the hardy warriors, in tossing plumes and shining steel,\r\nseemed elevated with a stern joy at finding themselves in possession of\r\nthis object of so many toils and perils. As the streets resounded\r\nwith the tramp of steeds and swelling peals of music the Moors buried\r\nthemselves in the deepest recesses of their dwellings. There they\r\nbewailed in secret the fallen glory of their race, but suppressed their\r\ngroans, lest they should be heard by their enemies and increase their\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\nThe royal procession advanced to the principal mosque, which had been\r\nconsecrated as a cathedral. Here the sovereigns offered up prayers and\r\nthanksgivings, and the choir of the royal chapel chanted a triumphant\r\nanthem, in which they were joined by all the courtiers and cavaliers.\r\nNothing (says Fray Antonio Agapida) could exceed the thankfulness to\r\nGod of the pious king Ferdinand for having enabled him to eradicate from\r\nSpain the empire and name of that accursed heathen race, and for the\r\nelevation of the cross in that city wherein the impious doctrines of\r\nMahomet had so long been cherished. In the fervor of his spirit he\r\nsupplicated from heaven a continuance of its grace and that this\r\nglorious triumph might be perpetuated.* The prayer of the pious monarch\r\nwas responded to by the people, and even his enemies were for once\r\nconvinced of his sincerity.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * The words of Fray Antonio Agapida are little more than an echo\r\nof those of the worthy Jesuit father Mariana (1. 25, c. 18).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the religious ceremonies were concluded the court ascended to the\r\nstately palace of the Alhambra and entered by the great Gate of Justice.\r\nThe halls lately occupied by turbaned infidels now rustled with stately\r\ndames and Christian courtiers, who wandered with eager curiosity\r\nover this far-famed palace, admiring its verdant courts and gushing\r\nfountains, its halls decorated with elegant arabesques and storied with\r\ninscriptions, and the splendor of its gilded and brilliantly painted\r\nceilings.\r\n\r\nIt had been a last request of the unfortunate Boabdil--and one which\r\nshowed how deeply he felt the transition of his fate--that no person\r\nmight be permitted to enter or depart by the gate of the Alhambra\r\nthrough which he had sallied forth to surrender his capital. His request\r\nwas granted; the portal was closed up, and remains so to the present\r\nday--a mute memorial of that event.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Garibay, Compend. Hist., lib. 40, c. 42.  The existence of this\r\ngateway and the story connected with it are perhaps known to few, but\r\nwere identified in the researches made to verify this history. The\r\ngateway is at the bottom of a tower at some distance from the main body\r\nof the Alhambra. The tower had been rent and ruined by gunpowder at the\r\ntime when the fortress was evacuated by the French. Great masses lie\r\naround half covered by vines and fig trees. A poor man, by the name\r\nof Mateo Ximenes, who lives in one of the halls among the ruins of the\r\nAlhambra, where his family has resided for many generations, pointed out\r\nto the author the gateway, still closed up with stones. He remembered\r\nto have heard his father and grandfather say that it had always been\r\nstopped up, and that out of it King Boabdil had gone when he surrendered\r\nGranada. The route of the unfortunate king may be traced thence across\r\nthe garden of the convent of Los Martyros, and down a ravine beyond,\r\nthrough a street of gypsy caves and hovels, by the gate of Los Molinos,\r\nand so on to the Hermitage of St. Sebastian. None but an antiquarian,\r\nhowever, will be able to trace it unless aided by the humble historian\r\nof the place, Mateo Ximenes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Spanish sovereigns fixed their throne in the presence-chamber of\r\nthe palace, so long the seat of Moorish royalty. Hither the principal\r\ninhabitants of Granada repaired to pay them homage and kiss their hands\r\nin token of vassalage, and their example was followed by deputies from\r\nall the towns and fortresses of the Alpuxarras which had not hitherto\r\nsubmitted.\r\n\r\nThus terminated the war of Granada, after ten years of incessant\r\nfighting, equalling (says Fray Antonio Agapida) the far-famed siege of\r\nTroy in duration, and ending, like that, in the capture of the city.\r\nThus ended also the dominion of the Moors in Spain, having endured seven\r\nhundred and seventy-eight years from the memorable defeat of Roderick,\r\nthe last of the Goths, on the banks of the Guadalete. The authentic\r\nAgapida is uncommonly particular in fixing the epoch of this event. This\r\ngreat triumph of our holy Catholic faith, according to his computation,\r\ntook place in the beginning of January in the year of our Lord 1492,\r\nbeing 3655 years from the population of Spain by the patriarch Tubal,\r\n3797 from the general deluge, 5453 from the creation of the world,\r\naccording to Hebrew calculation, and in the month Rabic, in the eight\r\nhundred and ninety-seventh year of the Hegira, or flight of Mahomet,\r\nwhom may God confound! saith the pious Agapida.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chronicle of the Conquest of Granada is finished, but the reader may\r\nbe desirous of knowing the subsequent fortunes of some of the principal\r\npersonages.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Boabdil retired with his mother, his wife, his son,\r\nhis sister, his vizier and bosom-counsellor Aben Comixa, and many other\r\nrelatives and friends, to the valley of Purchena, where a small but\r\nfertile territory had been allotted him, comprising several towns of\r\nthe Alpuxarras, with all their rights and revenues. Here, surrounded by\r\nobedient vassals, devoted friends, and a loving family, and possessed\r\nof wealth sufficient to enable him to indulge in his habitual luxury\r\nand magnificence, he for a time led a tranquil life, and may have looked\r\nback upon his regal career as a troubled dream from which he had happily\r\nawaked. Still, he appears to have pleased himself with a shadow of\r\nroyalty, making occasionally progresses about his little domains,\r\nvisiting the different towns, receiving the homage of the inhabitants,\r\nand bestowing largesses with a princely hand. His great delight,\r\nhowever, was in sylvan sports and exercises, with horses, hawks, and\r\nhounds, being passionately fond of hunting and falconry, so as to pass\r\nweeks together in sporting campaigns among the mountains. The jealous\r\nsuspicions of Ferdinand followed him into his retreat. No exertions were\r\nspared by the politically pious monarch to induce him to embrace the\r\nChristian religion as a means of severing him in feelings and sympathies\r\nfrom his late subjects; but he remained true to the faith of his\r\nfathers, and it must have added not a little to his humiliation to live\r\na vassal under Christian sovereigns.\r\n\r\nHis obstinacy in this respect aggravated the distrust of Ferdinand,\r\nwho, looking back upon the past inconstancy of the Moors, could not feel\r\nperfectly secure in his newly-conquered territories while there was one\r\nwithin their bounds who might revive pretensions to the throne and rear\r\nthe standard of an opposite faith in their behalf. He caused,\r\ntherefore, a vigilant watch to be kept upon the dethroned monarch in his\r\nretirement, and beset him with spies who were to report all his words\r\nand actions. The reader will probably be surprised to learn that the\r\nforemost of these spies was Aben Comixa! Ever since the capture and\r\nrelease of the niece of the vizier by the count de Tendilla, Aben Comixa\r\nhad kept up a friendly correspondence with that nobleman, and through\r\nthis channel had gradually been brought over to the views of Ferdinand.\r\nDocuments which have gradually come to light leave little doubt that\r\nthe vizier had been corrupted by the bribes and promises of the Spanish\r\nking, and had greatly promoted his views in the capitulation of Granada.\r\nIt is certain that he subsequently received great estates from the\r\nChristian sovereigns. While residing in confidential friendship with\r\nBoabdil in his retirement Aben Comixa communicated secretly with\r\nHernando de Zafra, the secretary of Ferdinand, who resided at Granada,\r\ngiving him information of all Boabdil’s movements, which the secretary\r\nreported by letter to the king. Some of the letters of the secretary\r\nstill exist in the archives of Samancas, and have been recently\r\npublished in the collection of unedited documents.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * El rey Muley Babdali (Boabdil) y sus criados andan continuamente\r\na casa con glagos y azores, y alla esta agora en al campo de Dalias y en\r\nVerja, aunque su casa tiene en Andarax, y dican que estara alla por todo\r\neste mes.--“Carta Secreta de Hernando de Zafra,” Decembre, 1492\r\n\r\n\r\nThe jealous doubts of Ferdinand were quickened by the letters of his\r\nspies. He saw in the hunting campaigns and royal progresses of\r\nthe ex-king a mode of keeping up a military spirit and a concerted\r\nintelligence among the Moors of the Alpuxarras that might prepare them\r\nfor future rebellion. By degrees the very residence of Boabdil within\r\nthe kingdom became incompatible with Ferdinand’s ideas of security. He\r\ngave his agents, therefore, secret instructions to work upon the mind\r\nof the deposed monarch, and induce him, like El Zagal, to relinquish\r\nhis Spanish estates for valuable considerations and retire to Africa.\r\nBoabdil, however, was not to be persuaded: to the urgent suggestions of\r\nthese perfidious counsellors he replied that he had given up a kingdom\r\nto live in peace, and had no idea of going to a foreign land to\r\nencounter new troubles and to be under the control of alarabes.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Letter of Hernando de Zafra to the sovereigns, Dec. 9, 1493.\r\n\r\n\r\nFerdinand persisted in his endeavors, and found means more effectual of\r\noperating on the mind of Boabdil and gradually disposing him to enter\r\ninto negotiations. It would appear that Aben Comixa was secretly active\r\nin this matter in the interests of the Spanish monarch, and was with him\r\nat Barcelona as the vizier and agent of Boabdil. The latter, however,\r\nfinding that his residence in the Alpuxarras was a cause of suspicion\r\nand uneasiness to Ferdinand, determined to go himself to Barcelona, have\r\na conference with the sovereigns, and conduct all his negotiations with\r\nthem in person. Zafra, the secretary of Ferdinand, who was ever on\r\nthe alert, wrote a letter from Granada apprising the king of Boabdil’s\r\nintention, and that he was making preparations for the journey. He\r\nreceived a letter in reply, charging him by subtle management to\r\nprevent, or at least delay, the coming of Boabdil to court.* The crafty\r\nmonarch trusted to effect through Aben Comixa as vizier and agent of\r\nBoabdil an arrangement which it might be impossible to obtain from\r\nBoabdil himself. The politic plan was carried into effect. Boabdil\r\nwas detained at Andarax by the management of Zafra. In the mean time a\r\nscandalous bargain was made on the 17th March, 1493, between Ferdinand\r\nand Aben Comixa, in which the latter, as vizier and agent of Boabdil,\r\nthough without any license or authority from him, made a sale of his\r\nterritory and the patrimonial property of the princesses for eighty\r\nthousand ducats of gold, and engaged that he should depart for Africa,\r\ntaking care, at the same time, to make conditions highly advantageous\r\nfor himself.**\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Letter of the sovereigns to Hernando de Zafra from Barcelona,\r\nFeb., 1493.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * *Alcantara, Hist. Granad., iv. c. 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis bargain being hastily concluded, Yusef Aben Comixa loaded the\r\ntreasure upon mules and departed for the Alpuxarras. Here, spreading the\r\nmoney before Boabdil, “Senior,” said he, “I have observed that as long\r\nas you live here you are exposed to constant peril. The Moors are rash\r\nand irritable; they may make some sudden insurrection, elevate your\r\nstandard as a pretext, and thus overwhelm you and your friends with\r\nutter ruin. I have observed also that you pine away with grief, being\r\ncontinually reminded in this country that you were once its sovereign,\r\nbut never more must hope to reign. I have put an end to these evils.\r\nYour territory is sold--behold the price of it! With this gold you may\r\nbuy far greater possessions in Africa, where you may live in honor and\r\nsecurity.”\r\n\r\nWhen Boabdil heard these words he burst into a sudden transport of rage,\r\nand, drawing his scimetar, would have sacrificed the officious Yusef on\r\nthe spot had not the attendants interfered and hurried the vizier from\r\nhis presence.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Marmol, Rebel. 1. 1, c. 22.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rage of Boabdil gradually subsided: he saw that he had been duped\r\nand betrayed, but he knew the spirit of Ferdinand too well to hope\r\nthat he would retract the bargain, however illegitimately effected.\r\nHe contented himself, therefore, with obtaining certain advantageous\r\nmodifications, and then prepared to bid a final adieu to his late\r\nkingdom and his native land.\r\n\r\nIt took some months to make the necessary arrangements, or, rather,\r\nhis departure was delayed by a severe domestic affliction. Morayma, his\r\ngentle and affectionate wife, worn out by agitations and alarms, was\r\ngradually sinking into the grave, a prey to devouring melancholy. Her\r\ndeath took place toward the end of August. Hernando de Zafra apprised\r\nKing Ferdinand of the event as one propitious to his purposes, removing\r\nan obstacle to the embarkation, which was now fixed for the month of\r\nSeptember. Zafra was instructed to accompany the exiles until he saw\r\nthem landed on the African coast.\r\n\r\nThe embarkation, however, did not take place until some time in the\r\nmonth of October. A caracca had been prepared at the port of Adra for\r\nBoabdil and his immediate family and friends. Another caracca and two\r\ngalliots received a number of faithful adherents, amounting, it is said,\r\nto eleven hundred and thirty, who followed their prince into exile.\r\n\r\nA crowd of his former subjects witnessed his embarkation. As the sails\r\nwere unfurled and swelled to the breeze, and the vessel bearing Boabdil\r\nparted from the land, the spectators would fain have given him a\r\nfarewell cheering; but the humbled state of their once proud sovereign\r\nforced itself upon their minds, and the ominous surname of his youth\r\nrose involuntarily to their tongues: “Farewell, Boabdil! Allah preserve\r\nthee, ‘El Zogoybi!’” burst spontaneously from their lips. The unlucky\r\nappellation sank into the heart of the expatriated monarch, and tears\r\ndimmed his eyes as the snowy summits of the mountains of Granada\r\ngradually faded from his view.\r\n\r\nHe was received with welcome at the court of his relative, Muley Ahmed,\r\ncaliph of Fez, the same who had treated El Zagal with such cruelty in\r\nhis exile. For thirty-four years he resided in this court, treated with\r\ngreat consideration, and built a palace or alcazar at Fez, in which,\r\nit is said, he endeavored to emulate the beauties and delights of the\r\nAlhambra.\r\n\r\nThe last we find recorded of him is in the year 1536, when he followed\r\nthe caliph to the field to repel the invasion of two brothers of the\r\nfamous line of the Xerifes, who at the head of Berber troops had taken\r\nthe city of Morocco and threatened Fez. The armies came in sight of each\r\nother on the banks of the Guadal Hawit, or river of slaves, at the ford\r\nof Balcuba. The river was deep, the banks were high and broken, and\r\nthe ford could only be passed in single file; for three days the armies\r\nremained firing at each other across the stream, neither venturing to\r\nattempt the dangerous ford. At length the caliph divided his army into\r\nthree battalions: the command of the first he gave to his brother-in-law\r\nand to Aliatar, son of the old alcayde of Loxa; another division he\r\ncommanded himself; and the third, composed of his best marksmen, he\r\nput under the command of his son, the prince of Fez, and Boabdil, now\r\na gray-haired veteran. The last mentioned column took the lead, dashed\r\nboldly across the ford, scrambled up the opposite bank, and attempted to\r\nkeep the enemy employed until the other battalions should have time to\r\ncross. The rebel army, however, attacked them with such fury that the\r\nson of the king of Fez and several of the bravest alcaydes were slain\r\nupon the spot; multitudes were driven back into the river, which was\r\nalready crowded with passing troops. A dreadful confusion took place;\r\nthe horse trampled upon the foot; the enemy pressed on them with fearful\r\nslaughter; those who escaped the sword perished by the stream; the river\r\nwas choked by the dead bodies of men and horses and by the scattered\r\nbaggage of the army. In this scene of horrible carnage fell Boabdil,\r\ntruly called El Zogoybi, or the Unlucky--an instance, says the ancient\r\nchronicler, of the scornful caprice of fortune, dying in defence of the\r\nkingdom of another after wanting spirit to die in defence of his own.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Marmol, Descrip. de Africa, p. 1, 1. 2, c. 40; idem, Hist. Reb. de\r\nlos Moros, lib. 1, c. 21.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aspersion of the chronicler is more caustic than correct. Boabdil\r\nnever showed a want of courage in the defence of Granada, but he wanted\r\nfirmness and decision: he was beset from the first by perplexities, and\r\nultimately by the artifices of Ferdinand and the treachery of those in\r\nwhom he most confided.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * In revising this account of the ultimate fortunes of Boabdil the\r\nauthor has availed himself of facts recently brought out in Alcantara’s\r\nHistory of Granada, which throw strong lights on certain parts of the\r\nsubject hitherto covered with obscurity.\r\n\r\n\r\nZORAYA, THE STAR OF THE MORNING.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the deadly rivalship of this youthful sultana with Ayxa\r\nla Horra, the virtuous mother of Boabdil, and the disasters to which her\r\nambitious intrigues gave rise, the placable spirit of Boabdil bore her\r\nno lasting enmity. After the death of his father he treated her with\r\nrespect and kindness, and evinced a brotherly feeling toward her sons\r\nCad and Nazar. In the capitulations for the surrender of Granada he took\r\ncare of her interests, and the possessions which he obtained for her\r\nwere in his neighborhood in the valleys of the Alpuxarras. Zoraya,\r\nhowever, under the influence of Queen Isabella, returned to the\r\nChristian faith, the religion of her infancy, and resumed her Spanish\r\nname of Isabella. Her two sons, Cad and Nazar, were baptized under the\r\nnames of Don Fernando and Don Juan de Granada, and were permitted to\r\ntake the titles of infantas or princes. They intermarried with noble\r\nSpanish families, and the dukes of Granada, resident in Valladolid, are\r\ndescendants of Don Juan (once Nazar), and preserve to the present day\r\nthe blazon of their royal ancestor, Muley Abul Hassan, and his motto, Le\r\nGalib ile Ala, God alone is conqueror.\r\n\r\n\r\nFATE OF ABEN COMIXA.\r\n\r\nAn ancient chronicle which has long remained in manuscript, but has\r\nbeen published of late years in the collection of Spanish historical\r\ndocuments,* informs us of the subsequent fortunes of the perfidious Aben\r\nComixa. Discarded and despised by Boabdil for his treachery, he repaired\r\nto the Spanish court, and obtained favor in the eyes of the devout queen\r\nIsabella by embracing the Christian religion, being baptized under her\r\nauspices with the name of Don Juan de Granada. He even carried his zeal\r\nfor his newly-adopted creed so far as to become a Franciscan friar.\r\nBy degrees his affected piety grew cool and the friar’s garb became\r\nirksome. Taking occasion of the sailing of some Venetian galleys from\r\nAlmeria, he threw off his religious habit, embarked on board of one of\r\nthem, and crossed to Africa, where he landed in the dress of a Spanish\r\ncavalier.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Padilla, Cronica de Felipe el Hermosa, cap. 18, y 19, as cited\r\nby Alcantara.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a private interview with Abderraman, the Moorish king of Bujia, he\r\nrelated his whole history, and declared that he had always been and\r\nstill was at heart a true Mahometan. Such skill had he in inspiring\r\nconfidence that the Moorish king took him into favor and appointed him\r\ngovernor of Algiers. While enjoying his new dignity a Spanish squadron\r\nof four galleys, under the celebrated count Pedro de Navarro, anchored\r\nin the harbor in 1509. Aben Comixa paid the squadron a visit of ceremony\r\nin his capacity of governor, gave the count repeated fetes, and in\r\nsecret conversations with him laid open all the affairs of the king of\r\nBujia, and offered, if the count should return with sufficient force,\r\nto deliver the city into his hands and aid him in conquering the whole\r\nterritory. The count hastened back to Spain and made known the proposed\r\ntreachery to the Cardinal Ximenes, then prime minister of Spain. In\r\nthe following month of January he was sent with thirty vessels and four\r\nthousand soldiers to achieve the enterprise. The expedition of Navarro\r\nwas successful. He made himself master of Bujia and seized in triumph on\r\nthe royal palace, but he found there the base Aben Comixa weltering in\r\nhis blood and expiring under numerous wounds. His treachery had been\r\ndiscovered, and the vengeance of the king of Bujia had closed his\r\nperfidious career.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH OF THE MARQUES OF CADIZ.\r\n\r\nThe renowned Roderigo Ponce de Leon, marques-duke of Cadiz, was\r\nunquestionably the most distinguished among the cavaliers of Spain for\r\nhis zeal, enterprise, and heroism in the great crusade of Granada. He\r\nbegan the war by the capture of Alhama; he was engaged in almost every\r\ninroad and siege of importance during its continuance; and was present\r\nat the surrender of the capital, the closing scene of the conquest. The\r\nrenown thus acquired was sealed by his death, which happened in the\r\nforty-eighth year of his age, almost immediately at the close of his\r\ntriumphs and before a leaf of his laurels had time to wither. He died at\r\nhis palace in the city of Seville on the 27th day of August, 1492, but a\r\nfew months after the surrender of Granada, and of an illness caused by\r\nexposures and fatigues undergone in this memorable war. That honest\r\nchronicler, Andres Bernaldez, the curate of Los Palacios, who was a\r\ncontemporary of the marques, draws his portrait from actual knowledge\r\nand observation. He was universally cited (says he) as the most perfect\r\nmodel of chivalrous virtue of the age. He was temperate, chaste, and\r\nrigidly devout, a benignant commander, a valiant defender of his\r\nvassals, a great lover of justice, and an enemy to all flatterers,\r\nliars, robbers, traitors, and poltroons.\r\n\r\nHis ambition was of a lofty kind: he sought to distinguish himself and\r\nhis family by heroic and resounding deeds, and to increase the patrimony\r\nof his ancestors by the acquisition of castles, domains, vassals,\r\nand other princely possessions. His recreations were all of a warlike\r\nnature; he delighted in geometry as applied to fortifications, and spent\r\nmuch time and treasure in erecting and repairing fortresses. He relished\r\nmusic, but of a military kind--the sound of clarions and sackbuts, of\r\ndrums and trumpets. Like a true cavalier, he was a protector of the sex\r\non all occasions, and an injured woman never applied to him in vain for\r\nredress. His prowess was so well known, and his courtesy to the fair,\r\nthat the ladies of the court, when they accompanied the queen to the\r\nwars, rejoiced to find themselves under his protection; for wherever his\r\nbanner was displayed the Moors dreaded to adventure. He was a faithful\r\nand devoted friend, but a formidable enemy; for he was slow to forgive,\r\nand his vengeance was persevering and terrible.\r\n\r\nThe death of this good and well-beloved cavalier spread grief and\r\nlamentation throughout all ranks. His relations, dependants, and\r\ncompanions-in-arms put on mourning for his loss, and so numerous were\r\nthey that half of Seville was clad in black. None, however, deplored his\r\ndeath more deeply and sincerely than his friend and chosen companion Don\r\nAlonso de Aguilar.\r\n\r\nThe funeral ceremonies were of the most solemn and sumptuous kind. The\r\nbody of the marques was arrayed in a costly shirt, a doublet of brocade,\r\na sayo or long robe of black velvet, a marlota or Moorish tunic of\r\nbrocade reaching to the feet, and scarlet stockings. His sword, superbly\r\ngilt, was girded to his side, as he used to wear it when in the field.\r\nThus magnificently attired, the body was enclosed in a coffin which was\r\ncovered with black velvet and decorated with a cross of white damask. It\r\nwas then placed on a sumptuous bier in the centre of the great hall of\r\nthe palace. Here the duchess made great lamentation over the body of her\r\nlord, in which she was joined by her train of damsels and attendants, as\r\nwell as by the pages and esquires and innumerable vassals.\r\n\r\nIn the close of the evening, just before the Ave Maria, the funeral\r\ntrain issued from the palace. Ten banners were borne around the bier,\r\nthe particular trophies of the marques won from the Moors by his valor\r\nin individual enterprises before King Ferdinand had commenced the war\r\nof Granada. The procession was swelled by an immense train of bishops,\r\npriests, and friars of different orders, together with the civil and\r\nmilitary authorities and all the chivalry of Seville, headed by the\r\ncount of Cifuentes, at that time intendente or commander of the city. It\r\nmoved slowly and solemnly through the streets, stopping occasionally and\r\nchanting litanies and responses. Two hundred and forty waxen tapers\r\nshed a light like the day about the bier. The balconies and windows\r\nwere crowded with ladies, who shed tears as the funeral train passed by,\r\nwhile the women of the lower classes were loud in their lamentations,\r\nas if bewailing the loss of a father or a brother. On approaching the\r\nconvent of St. Augustine the monks came forth with the cross and tapers\r\nand eight censers and conducted the body into the church, where it lay\r\nin state until all the vigils were performed by the different orders,\r\nafter which it was deposited in the family tomb of the Ponces in the\r\nsame church, and the ten banners were suspended over the sepulchre.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Cura de los Palacios, c.104.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tomb of the valiant Roderigo Ponce de Leon, with his banners\r\nmouldering above it, remained for ages an object of veneration with all\r\nwho had read or heard of his virtues and achievements. In the year\r\n1810, however, the chapel was sacked by the French, its altars were\r\noverturned, and the sepulchres of the family of the Ponces shattered to\r\npieces. The present duchess of Benevente, the worthy descendant of this\r\nillustrious and heroic line, has since piously collected the ashes\r\nof her ancestors, restored the altar, and repaired the chapel. The\r\nsepulchres, however, were utterly destroyed: an inscription in gold\r\nletters on the wall of the chapel to the right of the altar is all that\r\ndenotes the place of sepulture of the brave Ponce de Leon.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LEGEND OF THE DEATH OF DON ALONSO DE AGUILAR.\r\n\r\nTo such as feel an interest in the fortune of the valiant Don Alonso\r\nde Aguilar, the chosen friend and companion-in-arms of Ponce de Leon,\r\nmarques of Cadiz, and one of the most distinguished heroes of the war\r\nof Granada, a few particulars of his remarkable fate will not be\r\nunacceptable.\r\n\r\nFor several years after the conquest of Granada the country remained\r\nfeverish and unquiet. The zealous efforts of the Catholic clergy to\r\neffect the conversion of the infidels, and the coercion used for that\r\npurpose by government, exasperated the stubborn Moors of the mountains.\r\nSeveral missionaries were maltreated, and in the town of Dayrin two of\r\nthem were seized and exhorted, with many menaces, to embrace the Moslem\r\nfaith; on their resolutely refusing they were killed with staves and\r\nstones by the Moorish women and children, and their bodies burnt to\r\nashes.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Cura de los Palacios, c. 165.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon this event a body of Christian cavaliers assembled in Andalusia to\r\nthe number of eight hundred, and, without waiting for orders from the\r\nking, revenged the death of these martyrs by plundering and laying waste\r\nthe Moorish towns and villages. The Moors fled to the mountains, and\r\ntheir cause was espoused by many of their nation who inhabited those\r\nrugged regions. The storm of rebellion began to gather and mutter its\r\nthunders in the Alpuxarras. They were echoed from the Serrania of Ronda,\r\never ready for rebellion, but the strongest hold of the insurgents was\r\nin the Sierra (12) Bermeja, or chain of Red Mountains, which lie near\r\nthe sea, the savage rocks and precipices of which may be seen from\r\nGibraltar.\r\n\r\nWhen King Ferdinand heard of these tumults he issued a proclamation\r\nordering all the Moors of the insurgent regions to leave them within ten\r\ndays and repair to Castile; giving secret instructions, however, that\r\nthose who should voluntarily embrace the Christian faith might be\r\npermitted to remain. At the same time he ordered Don Alonso de Aguilar\r\nand the counts of Urena and Cifuentes to march against the rebels.\r\n\r\nDon Alonso de Aguilar was at Cordova when he received the commands of\r\nthe king. “What force is allotted us for this expedition?” said he.\r\nOn being told, he perceived that the number of troops was far from\r\nadequate. “When a man is dead,” said he, “we send four men into his\r\nhouse to bring forth the body. We are now sent to chastise these Moors,\r\nwho are alive, vigorous, in open rebellion, and ensconced in their\r\ncastles; yet they do not give us man to man.” These words of the brave\r\nAlonso de Aguilar were afterward frequently repeated, but, though he saw\r\nthe desperate nature of the enterprise, he did not hesitate to undertake\r\nit.\r\n\r\nDon Alonso was at that time in the fifty-first year of his age--a\r\nwarrior in whom the fire of youth was yet unquenched, though tempered\r\nby experience. The greater part of his life had been spent in camp and\r\nfield until danger was as his habitual element. His muscular frame had\r\nacquired the firmness of iron without the rigidity of age. His armor and\r\nweapons seemed to have become a part of his nature, and he sat like a\r\nman of steel on his powerful war-horse.\r\n\r\nHe took with him on this expedition his son, Don Pedro de Cordova, a\r\nyouth of bold and generous spirit, in the freshness of his days, and\r\narmed and arrayed with the bravery of a young Spanish cavalier. When the\r\npopulace of Cordova beheld the veteran father, the warrior of a thousand\r\nbattles, leading forth his son to the field, they bethought themselves\r\nof the family appellation. “Behold,” cried they, “the eagle teaching his\r\nyoung to fly! Long live the valiant line of Aguilar!”*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * “Aguilar,” the Spanish for eagle.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prowess of Don Alonso and of his companions-in-arms was renowned\r\nthroughout the Moorish towns. At their approach, therefore, numbers\r\nof the Moors submitted, and hastened to Ronda to embrace Christianity.\r\nAmong the mountaineers, however, were many of the Gandules, a tribe from\r\nAfrica, too proud of spirit to bend their necks to the yoke. At their\r\nhead was a Moor named El Feri of Ben Estepar, renowned for strength\r\nand courage. At his instigation his followers gathered together their\r\nfamilies and most precious effects, placed them on mules, and, driving\r\nbefore them their flocks and herds, abandoned their valleys and retired\r\nup the craggy passes of the Sierra (13) Bermeja. On the summit was a\r\nfertile plain surrounded by rocks and precipices, which formed a natural\r\nfortress. Here El Feri placed all the women and children and all the\r\nproperty. By his orders his followers piled great stones on the rocks\r\nand cliffs which commanded the defiles and the steep sides of the\r\nmountain, and prepared to defend every pass that led to his place of\r\nrefuge.\r\n\r\nThe Christian commanders arrived, and pitched their camp before the town\r\nof Monarda, a strong place, curiously fortified, and situated at the\r\nfoot of the highest part of the Sierra  (14) Bermeja. Here they remained\r\nfor several days, unable to compel a surrender. They were separated from\r\nthe skirt of the mountain by a deep barranca, or ravine, at the bottom\r\nof which flowed a small stream. The Moors commanded by El Feri drew down\r\nfrom their mountain-height, and remained on the opposite side of the\r\nbrook to defend a pass which led up to their stronghold.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon a number of Christian soldiers in mere bravado seized\r\na banner, crossed the brook, and, scrambling up the opposite bank,\r\nattacked the Moors. They were followed by numbers of their companions,\r\nsome in aid, some in emulation, but most in hope of booty. A sharp\r\naction ensued on the mountain-side. The Moors were greatly superior\r\nin number, and had the vantage-ground. When the counts of Urena and\r\nCifuentes beheld the skirmish, they asked Don Alonso de Aguilar his\r\nopinion. “My opinion,” said he, “was given at Cordova, and remains the\r\nsame: this is a desperate enterprise. However, the Moors are at hand,\r\nand if they suspect weakness in us it will increase their courage and\r\nour peril. Forward then to the attack, and I trust in God we shall gain\r\na victory.” So saying, he led his troops into the battle.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Bleda, 1. 5, c. 26.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the skirts of the mountain were several level places, like terraces;\r\nhere the Christians pressed valiantly upon the Moors, and had the\r\nadvantage; but the latter retreated to the steep and craggy heights,\r\nwhence they hurled darts and rocks upon their assailants. They defended\r\ntheir passes and defiles with valor, but were driven from height to\r\nheight until they reached the plain on the summit of the mountain where\r\ntheir wives and children were sheltered. Here they would have made a\r\nstand, but Alonso de Aguilar, with his son Don Pedro, charged upon\r\nthem at the head of three hundred men and put them to flight with great\r\ncarnage. While they were pursuing the flying enemy the rest of the army,\r\nthinking the victory achieved, dispersed themselves over the little\r\nplain in search of plunder. They pursued the shrieking females, tearing\r\noff their necklaces, bracelets, and anklets of gold, and they found so\r\nmuch treasure of various kinds collected in this spot that they threw by\r\ntheir armor and weapons to load themselves with booty.\r\n\r\nEvening was closing. The Christians, intent upon spoil, had ceased to\r\npursue the Moors, and the latter were arrested in their flight by the\r\ncries of their wives and children. Their leader, El Feri, threw himself\r\nbefore them. “Friends, soldiers,” cried he, “whither do you fly? Whither\r\ncan you seek refuge where the enemy cannot follow you? Your wives, your\r\nchildren, are behind you--turn and defend them; you have no chance for\r\nsafety but from the weapons in your hands.”\r\n\r\nThe Moors turned at his words. They beheld the Christians scattered\r\nabout the plain, many of them without armor, and all encumbered with\r\nspoil. “Now is the time!” shouted El Feri: “charge upon them while laden\r\nwith your plunder. I will open a path for you.” He rushed to the attack,\r\nfollowed by his Moors, with shouts and cries that echoed through\r\nthe mountains. The scattered Christians were seized with panic, and,\r\nthrowing down their booty, began to fly in all directions. Don Alonso\r\nde Aguilar advanced his banner and endeavored to rally them. Finding his\r\nhorse of no avail in these rocky heights, he dismounted, and caused his\r\nmen to do the same: he had a small band of tried followers, with which\r\nhe opposed a bold front to the Moors, calling on the scattered troops to\r\nrally in the rear.\r\n\r\nNight had completely closed. It prevented the Moors from seeing the\r\nsmallness of the force with which they were contending, and Don Alonso\r\nand his cavaliers dealt their blows so vigorously that, aided by\r\nthe darkness, they seemed multiplied to ten times their number.\r\nUnfortunately, a small cask of gunpowder blew up near to the scene of\r\naction. It shed a momentary but brilliant light over all the plain and\r\non every rock and cliff. The Moors beheld, with surprise, that they\r\nwere opposed by a mere handful of men, and that the greater part of\r\nthe Christians were flying from the field. They put up loud shouts of\r\ntriumph. While some continued the conflict with redoubled ardor,\r\nothers pursued the fugitives, hurling after them stones and darts and\r\ndischarging showers of arrows. Many of the Christians in their terror\r\nand their ignorance of the mountains, rushed headlong from the brinks of\r\nprecipices and were dashed in pieces.\r\n\r\nDon Alonso still maintained his ground, but, while some of the Moors\r\nassailed him in front, others galled him with all kinds of missiles from\r\nthe impending cliffs. Some of the cavaliers, seeing the hopeless nature\r\nof the conflict, proposed to abandon the height and retreat down the\r\nmountain. “No,” said Don Alonso proudly; “never did the banner of\r\nthe house of Aguilar retreat one foot in the field of battle.” He had\r\nscarcely uttered these words when his son Pedro was stretched at his\r\nfeet. A stone hurled from a cliff had struck out two of his teeth, and\r\na lance passed quivering through his thigh. The youth attempted to rise,\r\nand, with one knee on the ground, to fight by the side of his father.\r\nDon Alonso, finding him wounded, urged him to quit the field. “Fly, my\r\nson,” said he; “let us not put everything at venture upon one hazard.\r\nConduct thyself as a good Christian, and live to comfort and honor thy\r\nmother.”\r\n\r\nDon Pedro still refused to leave his side. Whereupon Don Alonso ordered\r\nseveral of his followers to bear him off by force. His friend Don\r\nFrancisco Alvarez of Cordova, taking him in his arms, conveyed him to\r\nthe quarters of the count of Urena, who had halted on the height at\r\nsome distance from the scene of battle for the purpose of rallying and\r\nsuccoring the fugitives. Almost at the same moment the count beheld his\r\nown son, Don Pedro Giron, brought in grievously wounded.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, Don Alonso, with two hundred cavaliers, maintained the\r\nunequal contest. Surrounded by foes, they fell, one after another,\r\nlike so many stags encircled by the hunters. Don Alonso was the last\r\nsurvivor, without horse and almost without armor, his corselet unlaced\r\nand his bosom gashed with wounds. Still, he kept a brave front to the\r\nenemy, and, retiring between two rocks, defended himself with such valor\r\nthat the slain lay in a heap before him.\r\n\r\nHe was assailed in this retreat by a Moor of surpassing strength and\r\nfierceness. The contest was for some time doubtful, but Don Alonso\r\nreceived a wound in the head, and another in the breast, which made\r\nhim stagger. Closing and grappling with his foe, they had a desperate\r\nstruggle, until the Christian cavalier, exhausted by his wounds, fell\r\nupon his back. He still retained his grasp upon his enemy. “Think not,”\r\n cried he, “thou hast an easy prize; know that I am Don Alonso, he of\r\nAguilar!”--“If thou art Don Alonso,” replied the Moor, “know that I am\r\nEl Feri of Ben Estepar.” They continued their deadly struggle, and\r\nboth drew their daggers, but Don Alonso was exhausted by seven ghastly\r\nwounds: while he was yet struggling his heroic soul departed from his\r\nbody, and he expired in the grasp of the Moor.\r\n\r\nThus fell Alonso de Aguilar, the mirror of Andalusian chivalry--one\r\nof the most powerful grandees of Spain for person, blood, estate, and\r\noffice. For forty years he had made successful war upon the Moors--in\r\nchildhood by his household and retainers, in manhood by the prowess of\r\nhis arm and in the wisdom and valor of his spirit. His pennon had always\r\nbeen foremost in danger; he had been general of armies, viceroy of\r\nAndalusia, and the author of glorious enterprises in which kings were\r\nvanquished and mighty alcaydes and warriors laid low. He had slain many\r\nMoslem chiefs with his own arm, and among others the renowned Ali Atar\r\nof Loxa, fighting foot to foot, on the banks of the Xenil. His judgment,\r\ndiscretion, magnanimity, and justice vied with his prowess. He was the\r\nfifth lord of his warlike house that fell in battle with the Moors.\r\n\r\n“His soul,” observes the worthy Padre Abarca, “it is believed, ascended\r\nto heaven to receive the reward of so Christian a captain; for that\r\nvery day he had armed himself with the sacraments of confession and\r\ncommunion.” *\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Abarca, Anales de Aragon, Rey xxx. cap. ii.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Moors, elated with their success, pursued the fugitive Christians\r\ndown the defiles and sides of the mountains. It was with the utmost\r\ndifficulty that the count de Urena could bring off a remnant of his\r\nforces from that disastrous height. Fortunately, on the lower slope of\r\nthe mountain they found the rear-guard of the army, led by the count\r\nde Cifuentes, who had crossed the brook and the ravine to come to their\r\nassistance. As the fugitives came flying in headlong terror down the\r\nmountain it was with difficulty the count kept his own troops from\r\ngiving way in panic and retreating in confusion across the brook. He\r\nsucceeded, however, in maintaining order, in rallying the fugitives,\r\nand checking the fury of the Moors; then, taking his station on a rocky\r\neminence, he maintained his post until morning, sometimes sustaining\r\nviolent attacks, at other times rushing forth and making assaults upon\r\nthe enemy. When morning dawned the Moors ceased to combat, and drew up\r\nto the summit of the mountain.\r\n\r\nIt was then that the Christians had time to breathe and to ascertain the\r\nsad loss they had sustained. Among the many valiant cavaliers who had\r\nfallen was Don Francisco Ramirez of Madrid, who had been captain-general\r\nof artillery throughout the war of Granada, and contributed greatly by\r\nhis valor and ingenuity to that renowned conquest. But all other griefs\r\nand cares were forgotten in anxiety for the fate of Don Alonso de\r\nAguilar. His son, Don Pedro de Cordova, had been brought off with great\r\ndifficulty from the battle, and afterward lived to be marques of Priego;\r\nbut of Don Alonso nothing was known, except that he was left with a\r\nhandful of cavaliers fighting valiantly against an overwhelming force.\r\n\r\nAs the rising sun lighted up the red cliffs of the mountains the\r\nsoldiers watched with anxious eyes if perchance his pennon might be\r\ndescried fluttering from any precipice or defile, but nothing of the\r\nkind was to be seen. The trumpet-call was repeatedly sounded, but empty\r\nechoes alone replied. A silence reigned about the mountain-summit which\r\nshowed that the deadly strife was over. Now and then a wounded warrior\r\ncame dragging his feeble steps from among the cliffs and rocks, but on\r\nbeing questioned he shook his head mournfully and could tell nothing of\r\nthe fate of his commander.\r\n\r\nThe tidings of this disastrous defeat and of the perilous situation of\r\nthe survivors reached King Ferdinand at Granada: he immediately marched\r\nat the head of all the chivalry of his court to the mountains of Ronda.\r\nHis presence with a powerful force soon put an end to the rebellion.\r\nA part of the Moors were suffered to ransom themselves and embark for\r\nAfrica; others were made to embrace Christianity; and those of the town\r\nwhere the Christian missionaries had been massacred were sold as slaves.\r\nFrom the conquered Moors the mournful but heroic end of Alonso de\r\nAguilar was ascertained.\r\n\r\nOn the morning after the battle, when the Moors came to strip and bury\r\nthe dead, the body of Don Alonso was found among those of more than\r\ntwo hundred of his followers, many of them alcaydes and cavaliers of\r\ndistinction. Though the person of Don Alonso was well known to the\r\nMoors, being so distinguished among them both in peace and war, yet it\r\nwas so covered and disfigured with wounds that it could with difficulty\r\nbe recognized. They preserved it with great care, and on making their\r\nsubmission delivered it up to King Ferdinand. It was conveyed with great\r\nstate to Cordova, amidst the tears and lamentations of all Andalusia.\r\nWhen the funeral train entered Cordova, and the inhabitants saw the\r\ncoffin containing the remains of their favorite hero, and the war-horse\r\nled in mournful trappings on which they had so lately seen him sally\r\nforth from their gates, there was a general burst of grief throughout\r\nthe city. The body was interred with great pomp and solemnity in the\r\nchurch of St. Hypolito.\r\n\r\nMany years afterward his granddaughter, Dona Catalina of Aguilar and\r\nCordova, marchioness of Priego, caused his tomb to be altered. On\r\nexamining the body the head of a lance was found among the bones,\r\nreceived without doubt among the wounds of his last mortal combat. The\r\nname of this accomplished and Christian cavalier has ever remained a\r\npopular theme of the chronicler and poet, and is endeared to the public\r\nmemory by many of the historical ballads and songs of his country. For\r\na long time the people of Cordova were indignant at the brave count de\r\nUrena, who they thought had abandoned Don Alonso in his extremity;\r\nbut the Castilian monarch acquitted him of all charge of the kind and\r\ncontinued him in honor and office. It was proved that neither he nor\r\nhis people could succor Don Alonso, or even know his peril, from the\r\ndarkness of the night. There is a mournful little Spanish ballad or\r\nromance which breathes the public grief on this occasion, and the\r\npopulace on the return of the count de Urena to Cordova assailed him\r\nwith one of its plaintive and reproachful verses:\r\n\r\n     Count Urena! Count Urena!\r\n     Tell us, where is Don Alonso!\r\n\r\n     (Dezid conde Urena!\r\n     Don Alonso, donde queda?)\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Bleda, 1. 5, c. 26.",
