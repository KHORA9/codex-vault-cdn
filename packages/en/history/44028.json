Appleton & Co., 346 Broadway.\r\n1858.\r\n\r\nEntered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1858,\r\nby Joel Munsell,\r\nin the Clerk's Office of the District Court for the Northern\r\nDistrict of New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of this work, as will be seen, is to bring together the great\r\nevents of each day of the year, in all ages, as far as their dates can\r\nbe ascertained, and to arrange them chronologically. It has been\r\nnecessary to observe brevity in its compilation, in order to reduce it\r\nwithin a proper compass. Hence notices of the most eminent men are often\r\nconfined to two or three lines, while individuals of less note have\r\noccasionally received more attention, on account of the absence of ready\r\nreference to them in books.\r\n\r\nThe dates are in accordance, it is believed, with the best authorities.\r\nGreat care has been taken to make them so, and nothing has been inserted\r\nfor which there was not at least some authority. Occasionally authors\r\nhave been found to disagree in days, months, and even years, and it has\r\nbeen necessary to reconcile, as well as possible, such discrepancies.\r\nMuch of this confusion arises from the change in the calendar; some\r\nauthors following the old, others the new style, without informing us\r\nwhich they adhere to. The protestant countries did not all adopt the new\r\nstyle till 1777, about two centuries after the catholic authorities had\r\nreformed the calendar. The Russians still use the Julian era, and are\r\nnow consequently twelve days behind the true time. With these\r\ndifficulties in the way, no ordinary vigilance ensures an entire freedom\r\nfrom error in a work like this. The dates here, however, are made to\r\nconform to the new style as far as practicable. In some cases where\r\ndifferent dates have been given, and it has been found impossible to\r\ndetermine the true one, the article has been inserted under different\r\ndays with cross references. Repetitions have crept in however, which\r\ncould only be discovered in preparing the index. Errors of this kind are\r\nperpetuated by a succession of authors following a wrong date, and are\r\nexceedingly difficult to detect, or when suspected, not easily traced to\r\ntheir origin. When dates have been taken from computations of time other\r\nthan the Christian era, it should be understood that the corresponding\r\nday has been made to conform to our own era, and consequently perfect\r\naccuracy can not be claimed for them.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that geography and chronology are the eyes of history;\r\nin aiding to promote one of these sciences, the reader will not fail to\r\ndiscover how great and varied is the amount of facts brought together,\r\nrendering the work of use to persons of every age and calling. A\r\nreference to the index will show more clearly the extent of the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEVERY DAY BOOK\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nHISTORY AND CHRONOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 1.\r\n\r\n154 B. C. It was fixed that the Roman consuls should always enter upon\r\ntheir office on this day, and the years were named after them. On this\r\noccasion they went in solemn procession to the Capitol to sacrifice to\r\nJupiter Capitolinus; after which the senate held a solemn session. Those\r\nwho had discharged the office of consul enjoyed the pre-eminence of rank\r\nover the other senators. They were annually elected by the people till\r\nthe time of Tiberius, who ordered that they should be chosen by the\r\nsenate. The last consul after whom the year was named, was Barsilius, in\r\nthe year 541, in the reign of Justinianus.\r\n\r\n38. B. C. The Spanish era, or era of the Cæsars, commenced, being the\r\nyear following the conquest of Spain by Augustus. It was much used in\r\nAfrica, Spain and the south of France; but was abolished by one kingdom\r\nafter another during the fourteenth century, and by Portugal 1555.\r\n\r\n404. TELEMACHUS, or St. Almachus, whose story is the foundation of\r\nFenelon's famed work _Telemaque_, suffered martyrdom at Rome.\r\n\r\n1109. The Festival of Fools was instituted at Paris, and continued\r\nprosperous for 240 years. This, with the Lords of Misrule, and the\r\nAbbots of Unreason, was doubtless designed to ridicule the Druidic\r\nsaturnalia.\r\n\r\n1308. WILLIAM TELL, the Swiss patriot, associated himself on this day\r\nwith a band of his countrymen against the tyranny of their oppressors.\r\n\r\n1349. EDWARD III, king of England, defeated the French before Calais\r\nwith great slaughter.\r\n\r\n1504. Birthday of CASPER CRUCIGER, an extensive and multifarious\r\nscholar, and a follower of Luther. He died 1548.\r\n\r\n1515. LOUIS XII of France, surnamed _the father of the people_, died.\r\nNotwithstanding the faults of his education, which had been purposely\r\nneglected, he became a wise and politic monarch, who had the welfare and\r\nimprovement of his country in mind. Though extensively engaged in wars,\r\nhe avoided burdening the people with taxes--was economical, just and\r\nmagnanimous.\r\n\r\n1513. JUAN DIAZ DE SOLIS, coasting the southern continent, discovered\r\nthe mouth of a river on this day, which in consequence he called Rio\r\nJaneiro.\r\n\r\n1516. JUAN DIAZ DE SOLIS again entered the Rio de Solis which he had\r\ndiscovered three years previous. In attempting a descent on the country\r\nhe was slain by the natives, who in sight of the ship cut his body in\r\npieces, and roasted and devoured it. He was reputed the ablest navigator\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\n1523. Knights of Malta driven from the island of Rhodes by the Turks.\r\n\r\n1537. JAMES V of Scotland married Magdalen, daughter of Francis I of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n1617. HENRY GOLTZIUS, a distinguished Dutch painter and engraver, died.\r\nHis father was a painter on glass, and gave his son instructions in the\r\nart; but it was his own genius and application that raised him to the\r\nrank he ultimately held among the best artists of the time.\r\n\r\n1618. Charter of the first New Netherland company expired by its own\r\nlimitation.\r\n\r\n1618. Birthday of BARTHOLOMEW ESTEBAN MURILLO, the greatest of all the\r\nSpanish painters. He was employed by the churches and convents of\r\nSeville a great number of years, which were enriched by the masterly\r\nproductions of his pencil, and procured for himself an independent\r\nfortune. Having been invited to Cadiz, he there executed his grand\r\npicture of St. Catharine; but just as he was about to finish it he was\r\ndreadfully wounded on the scaffolding, and died at Seville, 1682.\r\n\r\n1630. THOMAS HOBSON, the celebrated carrier of Cambridge, England,\r\ndied. One of the most general proverbial expressions in England\r\noriginated with him. He let to students and others horses, and his\r\npractice was to secure equal portions of rest as well as work for each\r\nhorse. Hence when applied to for any, none but that which had its due\r\nproportion of rest could be let. \"This or none\" was the answer. Hence\r\nthe phrase \"Hobson's choice; this or none.\"\r\n\r\n1644. MICHOB ADER, calling himself the Wandering Jew, appeared at Paris,\r\nwhere he created an extraordinary sensation among all ranks. He\r\npretended to have lived sixteen hundred years, and that he had traveled\r\nthrough all regions of the world. He was visited by the literati of the\r\ncity, and no one could accost him in a language that he was ignorant of;\r\nhe was also familiar with the history of persons and events from the\r\ntime of Christ, so that he was never confounded by intricate or\r\ncross-questions; but replied readily and without embarrassment. The\r\nlearned looked upon him as a counterfeit, or madman, yet they took their\r\nleave of him bewildered and astonished.\r\n\r\n1651. CHARLES II crowned king of Scotland at Scone.\r\n\r\n1661. A parliament met in Scotland.\r\n\r\n1700. The Russians began their new year.\r\n\r\n1715. WILLIAM WYCHERLEY died, aged 81, an eminent English dramatic\r\nwriter and comic poet.\r\n\r\n1727. CLAUDE ADRIAN HELVETIUS died; a celebrated Dutch physician, who,\r\nhaving obtained celebrity by introducing the use of ipecacuanha in\r\ndysentery, was made inspector general of military hospitals, and died at\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n1729. Great fog in London, persons lost their way in St. James' park,\r\nand many fell into the canal.\r\n\r\n1730. SAMUEL SEWALL, chief justice of the supreme court of Massachusetts\r\ndied.\r\n\r\n1731. EDWARD CAVE printed the first number of the well known\r\n_Gentleman's Magazine_.\r\n\r\n1748. Birthday of GODFREY AUGUSTUS BURGER, a celebrated German poet, and\r\nthe writer of that whimsical satire, _Munchausen's Travels_.\r\n\r\n1748. JOHN BERNOUILLI, a Swiss mathematician, died. He was born at Basil\r\nin Switzerland, and educated for a merchant, but afterwards studied\r\nmedicine, and finally devoted his attention to mathematics with great\r\nsuccess. He was the contemporary of Leibnitz and De L'Hopital, and of\r\nNewton. His labors in the science were indefatigable, and his works\r\ncontain an immense mass of discovery. But the details of his private\r\nlife exhibit an unusual degree of acerbity and disingenuousness.\r\n\r\n1752. The new style commenced this day in England by act of parliament.\r\n(See March 25.)\r\n\r\n1757. Calcutta surrendered to the British under Admiral Watson, Colonel\r\nClive and Captain Coote.\r\n\r\n1761. Great hurricane in the East Indies, destroying a part of the\r\nBritish fleet; of the crews of three of the ships lost but 14 were saved\r\nout of 1100.\r\n\r\n1776. Norfolk Burnt. Lord Dunmore, the royal governor of Virginia,\r\nhaving abandoned the town and retired on board his ships, became\r\ndistressed for provisions; and on the arrival of the Liverpool man of\r\nwar, the inhabitants refusing to supply his majesty's ships, the place\r\nwas reduced to ashes. The provincials themselves destroyed the houses\r\nand plantations near the water, to deprive the ships of every resource\r\nof supply.\r\n\r\n1781. Revolt of the Pennsylvania line at Morristown, N. J. They had\r\nenlisted for three years, and that term having expired they wished to be\r\ndischarged.\r\n\r\n1787. ARTHUR MIDDLETON, a signer of the Declaration of Independence,\r\ndied. He was a native of South Carolina, born 1743, and educated in\r\nEngland; and at the age of twenty-two made the tour of Europe. On the\r\nbreaking out of the war he engaged warmly on the side of the colonies.\r\nIn 1779 he distinguished himself in the defence of Charleston against\r\nthe British, who afterwards ravaged his plantation and rifled his\r\nmansion, by which he suffered an immense loss of property; and in the\r\nfollowing year he was taken prisoner. On the termination of the contest\r\nhe returned to his native seat, and spent the remainder of his life in\r\nelegant and philosophical ease--a model of private wealth and public\r\nvirtue; a firm patriot and an enlightened philanthropist.\r\n\r\n1793. A beginning was made upon the Pennsylvania state canal, at\r\nConewago falls; seventeen rocks being blasted--one for each stockholder\r\nof the canal company.\r\n\r\n1794.

JEAN MOURTRIE, a Frenchman, died at the age of 115. He was a\r\ntilemaker, and continued his occupation to the age of 109. He was a\r\npattern of honor and integrity; his gaiety made the young fond of his\r\nsociety; and his mild and even temper and kind disposition gained him\r\nthe love of all who knew him.\r\n\r\n1814. Great fog in London, which had commenced on the 27th of December,\r\nwas now at its greatest density, extending seventy miles from the\r\nmetropolis.

Great Britain acknowledged the independence of the South American\r\nrepublics.\r\n\r\n1835. CHARLES LAMB died. He was the author of the beautiful stories of\r\n_Elia_, which are universally admired. His exquisite humor, fancy,\r\nfeeling and wit, have given an endurable character to his essays. The\r\nbettering of the condition of mankind was his great aim, and he was in\r\nthe esteem of every philanthropist.\r\n\r\n1835. First daily paper in Buffalo, New York.\r\n\r\n1837.

Great fire at Constantinople destroyed 400 houses; among which\r\nwere those of the Greek patriarch, and the patriarch of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 2.\r\n\r\n17. TITUS LIVIUS died at Padua. His history of Rome, to which he devoted\r\ntwenty years, rendered him so celebrated, that a Spaniard is said to\r\nhave gone from Cadiz to Rome for the purpose merely of seeing him. His\r\nhistory was written in 140 books, of which only 35 are extant. Five of\r\nthese were discovered at Worms 1731, and some fragments are said to have\r\nbeen since found at Herculaneum. Few particulars of his life are known,\r\nbut his fame was great even while he lived, and his history has made him\r\nimmortal.\r\n\r\n17. PUBLIUS OVIDUS NASO, the Roman poet, died in exile at Tomos (a town\r\non the inhospitable coast of the Black sea), aged 60. He exhibited an\r\nunconquerable predilection for poetry, and the ease and the enjoyments\r\nof life, which his fortune placed within his power. He traveled in\r\nGreece and Asia which added to his accomplishments; his works were\r\nadapted to the public taste, and he was esteemed by the learned: Horace\r\nand Virgil were his friends, and he was a welcome visitor at the court\r\nof Augustus. Until his fiftieth year he appears to have lived almost\r\nsolely for poetry and pleasure. He might have hoped to pass the\r\nremaining years of his life in peace, under the shadow of his laurels,\r\nbut he was suddenly banished by Augustus, for some unknown cause. His\r\n_Metamorphoses_, and _Art of Love_ are often republished in our\r\nlanguage. He painted nature with a masterly hand, and his genius\r\nimparted elegance to vulgarity; but impurity defiles the sweetness of\r\nhis numbers, and his finest productions are sullied with licentiousness.\r\n\r\n1547. Conspiracy of Genoa, headed by John Lewis Fiesco; his being\r\ndrowned in the night, occasioned the failure of the scheme, in the very\r\nmoment of success.\r\n\r\n1604. The Jesuits reinstated in France.\r\n\r\n1731.

The Whitefield methodists observed this day in thanksgiving for\r\nthe victories of the king of Prussia in favor of England.\r\n\r\n1759. The French surprised and captured Frankfort on the Maine.\r\n\r\n1766. JAMES EDWARD FRANCIS STUART, the Pretender, died. He was the\r\neldest son of James II, born at London 1688. He was five months old when\r\nhis father was dethroned, and the royal family fled to France. His elder\r\nsister Anne afterwards came to the throne, and some effort was made to\r\nsecure his own succession; but it does not appear that he entered into\r\nthe project with much spirit.\r\n\r\n1771. LEWIS CÆSAR, count d'Estrees, marshal of France, and minister of\r\nstate, died aged 76. He distinguished himself in the war against Spain,\r\nand afterwards in 1741, wherein his bravery was conspicuous and his\r\nservices meritorious. In 1756 he was placed at the head of the French\r\nforces in Germany, but was superceded by Richelieu through intrigue.\r\n\r\n1774. The coffin of EDWARD I opened by a deputation from the society of\r\nantiquarians, after it had been buried 467 years. In a coffin of yellow\r\nstone they found the royal body in perfect preservation, enclosed in two\r\nwrappers; one of them was gold tissue, strongly waxed and fresh; the\r\nother and outermost considerably decayed. The corpse was habited in a\r\nrich mantle of purple lined with white and adorned with ornaments of\r\ngilt metal, studded with red and blue stones and pearls. Two similar\r\nornaments lay on the hands. The mantle was fastened on the right\r\nshoulder by a magnificent _fibula_ of the same metal, with the same\r\nstones and pearls. His face had over it a silken covering, so fine, and\r\nso closely fitted to it, as to preserve the features entire. Round his\r\ntemples was a gilt coronet of _fleur de lys_. In his hands, which were\r\nalso entire, were two sceptres of gilt metal; that in the right\r\nsurmounted by a cross fleure, that in the left by three clusters of oak\r\nleaves, and a dove on a globe. The feet enveloped in the mantle and\r\nother coverings were sound and the toes distinct. Its length was 6 feet\r\n2 inches.\r\n\r\n1777. Cannonading at Trenton; the British repulsed in their attempt to\r\ncross Sanpink creek bridge. In the night Gen. Washington retired leaving\r\nhis fires burning.\r\n\r\n1780. The Dutch admiral, Count Byland, refusing to permit the British\r\nadmiral, Fielding, to search his convoy, an action ensued, and the Dutch\r\nships, two of the line and two frigates, surrendered; after detaining\r\nseven of the convoy, the Dutch admiral had permission to proceed; but he\r\nrefused without the whole of his charge, and therefore sailed into\r\nSpithead.\r\n\r\n1788. Georgia ratified the Constitution of the United States, without\r\namendment, being the fourth state to do so.\r\n\r\n1795. JOSIAH WEDGEWOOD, the inventor of the scale that bears his name in\r\nthe thermometer for determining the different degrees of metallic heat,\r\ndied at his residence in England.\r\n\r\n1801. JOHN GASPER CHRISTIAN LAVATER died. He was born at Zurich, in\r\nSwitzerland, where his father was a physician of skill and reputation.\r\nIn 1763 he traveled in Germany; in 1767 appeared as a poet; and in 1769\r\nas a preacher of much popularity. All his activity was devoted to\r\nreligion until he undertook his work on physiognomy. This great work in\r\n4 vols. quarto, in which he had collected the features of distinguished\r\npersons from all parts of the world, made him known throughout Europe.\r\nHe published several other works, and became so popular that his\r\njourneys resembled triumphs. On the capture of Zurich by Massena, he\r\nreceived a shot while assisting the wounded in the street, which\r\nalthough he lived more than a year, and wrote several works, was the\r\ncause of his death.\r\n\r\n1809. Two French ships of war and eleven victualers, proceeding to\r\nBarcelona, were captured in the port of Caldagues by the British under\r\nLord Cochrane.\r\n\r\n1809.

He was\r\nborn at Dijon 1737, and distinguished himself in 1773 by the invention\r\nof the method of purifying the air by means of chlorine. He was an\r\nupright, able, eloquent and business man; and founded a school at Dijon\r\nfor the study of his favorite science, chemistry. He was a member of the\r\nnational assembly and convention at the time of the revolution, and\r\nassisted to establish the polytechnic school.\r\n\r\n1827. JOHN MASON GOOD, an English physician, poet and philological\r\nwriter, died. At the age of 15 he was apprenticed to a surgeon; in 1793\r\nremoved to London, and by talent and perseverance, succeeded in\r\nestablishing both a literary and professional fame. He was a voluminous\r\nwriter, and the extent and variety of his works evince the greatest\r\nindustry, and a retentive and orderly mind. He acquired thirteen\r\nEuropean and Asiatic languages, and at the time of his death had just\r\ncompleted a translation of the Psalms.\r\n\r\n1829. Forty men and thirty horses destroyed by an explosion of fire damp\r\nin a mine near Lyons, France.\r\n\r\n1831. BERTHOLD GEORGE NIEBUHR the historian, died. He was the son of\r\nNiebuhr the traveler, born at Copenhagen 1777, and finished his\r\neducation at Edinburgh. He traveled much and received great attention\r\nwherever he went. In 1810 he delivered his lectures on Roman history at\r\nBerlin; and in 1815, on the death of his father, planned and published\r\nhis biography. In 1827 he published the first volume of a remodeled\r\nedition of his Roman history; the second volume appeared a few months\r\nbefore his death, leaving the third unpublished.\r\n\r\n1835.

He was confined three years in the Tower\r\nunder the parliament, during which he wrote a work on military and\r\npolitical affairs; but finally accepted a commission in the republican\r\narmy against the Irish, the Scotch and the Dutch. But at the death of\r\nthe Protector he employed his influence to reinstate the Stuarts. In\r\n1666 he was again employed against the son of his old antagonist Tromp,\r\nin which the English fleet was much damaged, and both claimed the\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\n1717. LAMBERT BOSS, an eminent Dutch philologist, died. He was born in\r\nFriesland 1670; studied under his father who was a clergyman, became\r\nprivate tutor in a family of rank, and subsequently professor of Greek\r\nin the university of Franeker. He was an indefatigable student, and\r\nregretted every moment which could not be devoted to his favorite\r\npursuit. The number and character of his works mark his industry.\r\n\r\n1724.

His father was a Staffordshire potter, to\r\nwhose business he succeeded, and soon distinguished himself by his\r\ndiscoveries and improvements, insomuch that in a few years England,\r\ninstead of importing the finer earthen wares, was enabled to supply her\r\nneighbors. He was a scientific, as well as an active and enterprising\r\nman--and benevolent withal.\r\n\r\n1797.

He was born at\r\nParis 1655, where his mother wished to educate him; but his father and\r\ngrandfather stole him away at the age of three months, that he might\r\npass his childhood among the people whom he was destined to govern. He\r\nserved his first campaign under Montellucco against Turenne. He was in\r\nVienna when that city was besieged by the Turks, and subsequently\r\ncommanded against the Turks in the Danube. He was one of the greatest\r\ngenerals of his time; made 26 campaigns, commanded at 25 sieges, fought\r\nat 13 battles, yet was never really defeated.\r\n\r\n1753.

He was afterwards connected with several periodicals.\r\nHis works are published in 7 vols.\r\n\r\n1825. FERDINAND IV of Naples died. The life of this prince is remarkable\r\nfor the uncommon length of his reign, and its many vicissitudes,\r\nembracing a period of 65 years, and being closely connected with all the\r\ngreat events of Europe during the last half century. He was born 1751,\r\nand came to the throne at the age of eight. The first thirty years of\r\nhis reign were attended with peace and happiness; but in 1798 the\r\ncountry was invaded by Bonaparte, before whom Ferdinand fled to Sicily:\r\nand afterwards in 1820 the Carbonari effected a revolution which again\r\nbanished the royal family. The interposition of the Austrians, however,\r\nrestored the ancient order of things, which continued till the death of\r\nthe king, four years after.\r\n\r\n1827. JAMES CHAMBERS, an eccentric poet, died in misery at a farm-house\r\nin Stratbroke, England. From the age of 16 to 70 he wandered about the\r\ncountry, gaining a precarious subsistence by selling his own effusions,\r\nof which he had a number printed in a cheap form. His compositions were\r\nmostly suggested to him by his muse, during the stillness of the night\r\nwhile reposing in some friendly barn or hay-loft. When so inspired, he\r\nwould arise and commit the effusion to paper. He continued through life\r\nin hopeless poverty, and was a lonely man and a wanderer, who had\r\nneither act nor part in the common ways of the world.\r\n\r\n1835. Thermometer 40 deg. below zero, at Lebanon, N. Y., the mercury\r\nbecoming solid. It was severely cold throughout the United States.\r\n\r\n1843.

The history of his life unfolds a series of most revolting\r\ncrimes; but there is reason to believe that some of them are unreal.\r\nMurder, rapine and conflagration, were the first pleasures of his life.\r\nPompey, Crassus and Cæsar favored his schemes with a view to their own\r\naggrandizement. Only two Romans remained determined to uphold their\r\nfalling country--Cato and Cicero. The speeches of the latter in the\r\nRoman senate on the crisis of affairs are imperishable monuments of\r\neloquence and patriotism, and produced the overthrow of the\r\nconspirators. Five of them were put to death, and Catiline being\r\nsurrounded by the army under Petreius resolved to die sword in hand. The\r\nbattle was fought with desperation, and the insurgents fell, with their\r\nleader at their head.\r\n\r\n1066. EDWARD the Confessor, king of England, died. He was called to the\r\nthrone 1041. He was not the immediate heir, but his claim was supported\r\nof Godwin, earl of Kent, whose daughter Editha he married. He was a weak\r\nand superstitious prince, and acquired the title of _Saint_ or\r\n_Confessor_, by abstaining from nuptial connection with his queen. He\r\nwas the first English monarch who undertook to cure the _king's-evil_ by\r\ntouching the patient. With him ended the Saxon line of kings.\r\n\r\n1477. CHARLES the Bold, duke of Burgundy, killed in battle on this or\r\nthe following day. This prince, the son of Philip the Good and Isabella\r\nof Portugal, early displayed a violent, impetuous and ambitious\r\ndisposition; and in after life was constantly embroiled in unjust and\r\ncruel warfare, in which he performed many daring exploits. But having\r\nturned his arms against the Swiss, the fortune of war turned against\r\nhim; and being deserted by his allies, with his usual temerity risked a\r\nbattle with only 4000 men against a vastly superior force, was defeated\r\nand killed by the thrust of a lance in the 44th year of his age. His\r\nbody covered with blood and mire, and his head imbedded in the ice, was\r\nnot found till two days after the battle, when it was so disfigured that\r\nhis own brother did not recognize it. With him expired the feudal\r\ngovernment of Burgundy.\r\n\r\n1531. The electoral college assembled at Rome and elected Ferdinand,\r\nbrother of Charles V, king of the Romans. He was crowned a few days\r\nafter at Aix-la-Chapelle.\r\n\r\n1536. CATHARINE OF ARRAGON, the repudiated queen of Henry VIII, died.\r\nShe was the youngest daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella, born 1483. She\r\nwas first married to Arthur, prince of Wales, who died five months\r\nafter; and the king unwilling to return her dowry caused her to be\r\ncontracted to his remaining son, Henry. The prince, at the age of 15,\r\nmade a public protest against this proceeding, but finally consented to\r\nthe match. Notwithstanding the inequality of their ages and the\r\ncapricious disposition of the king, they had been married 20 years when\r\nthe division took place. This separation led to a divorce from the pope\r\nalso, and was the cause of mighty effects.\r\n\r\n1559. CATHARINE DE MEDICIS died. She was born at Florence 1519; married,\r\n1533, the dauphin, afterwards Henry II, of France. She was three times\r\nregent of France, and during her administration made a conspicuous\r\nfigure in the annals of Europe by her political genius. By her was begun\r\nthe palace of the Tuilleries; but the lasting monument of her fame and\r\niniquity is the massacre of St. Bartholomew's, which was brought about\r\nby her intrigues, when more than 50,000 protestants were massacred in\r\none day.\r\n\r\n1621. PAUL VAN SOMER died in London. He was born at Antwerp, 1576, and\r\narrived at great proficiency as a painter. His pencil was chiefly\r\nemployed on portraits of royal and eminent personages, and is said to\r\nhave equalled Vandyke.\r\n\r\n1636.

The account of this journey, and of what he saw and\r\nlearned at Pekin, is the most valuable part of his book, and one of the\r\nbest and most interesting relations ever written by any traveler.\r\n\r\n1724. CZARTAN PETRARCH died, aged 184, at a village near Temeswar, in\r\nHungary. He was born in the year 1539; and at the time the Turks took\r\nTemeswar from the Christians he was employed in keeping his father's\r\ncattle. A few days before his death he had walked with the help of a\r\nstick to the post house to ask charity of the travelers. His hair and\r\nbeard were of a greenish-white color, like mouldy bread; and he had a\r\nfew of his teeth remaining, and enjoyed a little eyesight. His son, who\r\nwas ninety-seven years of age, declared that his father had married at\r\nan extreme age, for the third time, and that he was born in this last\r\nmarriage. He had descendants in the fifth generation, with whom he\r\nsometimes sported, carrying them in his arms. His son, though\r\nninety-seven, was still fresh and vigorous. The commandant of Temeswar\r\non learning of his sickness, caused his portrait to be painted, and it\r\nwas nearly finished when he expired.\r\n\r\n1757.

He was born at Windham, Ct., 1732; his father being\r\na farmer could allow him only a common school education; but his own\r\nassiduity made up the deficiency, so that at the age of 22 he commenced\r\nthe study of the law with borrowed books; in 1764 he was sent to the\r\ngeneral assembly; 1765 appointed king's attorney; 1774 raised to the\r\nbench of the supreme court; 1775 sent a delegate to the general congress\r\nof the colonies, and in 1779 succeeded John Jay as president of\r\ncongress.

His first\r\nplay appeared in 1697, and was followed by many dramatic pieces and\r\npoems which were sufficiently worthless to procure their author an\r\nimperishable notoriety in the _Dunciad_, where Pope has gibbeted him.

FERDINAND ALVAREZ DE TOLEDO, duke of Alva, a Spanish general and\r\nminister of state, died, aged 74. It is said of him that during nearly\r\nsixty years of warfare against different enemies, he never lost a\r\nbattle, and was never taken by surprise. He was undoubtedly the ablest\r\ngeneral of his age; had a proud mien, a noble aspect and a strong frame;\r\nslept little, labored and wrote much. But pride, severity and cruelty\r\ntarnished his renown, so that he became odious even to his own\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\n1609. JOSEPH JUSTUS SCALIGER died, aged 69. His education commenced\r\nearly, and he was one of the most indefatigable students through a long\r\nlife, that was ever known. So entirely immersed was he in his studies,\r\nthat he passed whole days in his chamber without eating or drinking, and\r\npaid very little attention to the common affairs of life. He may be\r\ncalled the founder of the science of chronology.\r\n\r\n1647. The plague broke out at Edinburgh. A writer of the time says, that\r\nthe last plague they had raged so violently that the fortieth person\r\nlived not of those who dwelt there four years before, but that it was\r\npeopled with new faces.\r\n\r\n1666. SHAH JEHAN, a Mogul emperor, died, aged 74. He was the son and\r\nsuccessor of Jehangir, but did not inherit much of the talent and spirit\r\nof that powerful ruler.

He invited his old\r\nfriends the fakirs, or religious mendicants, to a feast, and compelled\r\nthem to put on new and decent clothing. The gold and silver pieces which\r\nhe found on burning their old garments, was of great service to him in\r\nprosecuting the war against his elder brother for the sovereignty. He\r\nstirred up dissensions among his brothers, by which they were put out of\r\nhis way, shut up his father in his harem, and in 1659 ascended the\r\nthrone. Notwithstanding his cruelty he governed with much wisdom, and\r\nconsulted the welfare of his people. Two of his sons endeavoring to form\r\na party in their own favor, he caused to be put to death by slow poison.\r\nIn the midst of his activity he died at Ahmednagar, and with his death\r\nterminated the brilliant epoch of the Moguls.\r\n\r\n1721. FRANCIS PAGI died, author of a chronological history of the popes.\r\n\r\n1733. BERNARD DE MANDEVILLE, an English author, died. He was born at\r\nDort in Holland, and went to England to practice medicine. Meeting with\r\npoor encouragement, he turned author; but his topics, though professedly\r\nintended for the promotion of the public morals, introduced him to the\r\nnotice of the grand jury. His pen procured the means of subsistence, but\r\nacquired for him an unenviable notoriety.\r\n\r\n1750. JOHN BLAND, the renowned writing master, died at his academy in\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n1759. Battle of Wandewash, in India. The French under Lally defeated\r\nwith the loss of 800 killed and wounded, by the British under Col.\r\nCoote, who lost 262 do.\r\n\r\n1769. The first letter of JUNIUS appeared in Woodfall's _Public\r\nAdvertiser_; and the last number was also published on this day, 1772.\r\n\r\n1773. ALEXIS PIRON, a French dramatist, died. His first effusions were\r\nsatires, which procured him so many enemies that even in the latter part\r\nof his life he could not get admission into the Academy. He revenged\r\nhimself by calling them _les invalides du bel esprit_, and composing his\r\nown humorous epitaph:\r\n\r\n     _Ci-git Piron, qui ne fut rien,\r\n     Pas même académicien._\r\n\r\n1774. MUSTAPHA III, emperor of Turkey, died, and was succeeded by his\r\nbrother Abdul Hamet.\r\n\r\n1775.

Grand fete in Paris on the birth of the dauphin.\r\n\r\n1793. LOUIS XVI beheaded at Paris, aged 38. He had reigned 17 years and\r\n7 months, and is now represented as an amiable and benevolent man,\r\nanxious to make his subjects happy; who in turn treated him in the\r\nvilest manner, and executed him as a tyrant and a traitor. His behavior\r\non many trying occasions vindicated him effectually of timidity, and\r\nshowed that the unwillingness to shed blood by which he was particularly\r\ndistinguished, arose from benevolence, and not from pusillanimity. Upon\r\nthe scaffold he exhibited a firmness that became a noble spirit.\r\n\r\n1814. JACQUES BERNARDIN HENRY DE ST. PIERRE, a French philosophical\r\nwriter, died, at his estate near Paris. He is best known as the author\r\nof _Paul and Virginia_, which appeared in 1788, and passed through fifty\r\neditions in one year. It has been generally translated in Europe.\r\n\r\n1815. MATTHIAS CLAUDIUS, a German poet, died. His prose and poetry are\r\nsaid to bear a peculiar stamp of humor, frankness and cordiality, and\r\nmany of his songs, set to music by the first composers, have become a\r\npart of the national melodies. He filled several public offices.\r\n\r\n1816. Day of general mourning in France, on account of the death of\r\nLouis XVI, twenty-three years after his execution.\r\n\r\n1820. AMBROISE MARIE FRANCIS JOSEPH PALISOT DE BEAUVAIS, a French\r\nnaturalist, died. He came to America in the pursuit of science, and\r\nwhile at Philadelphia learnt that he had been proscribed by the\r\nrevolutionists as an emigrant. He supported himself as a teacher of\r\nmusic and languages until the arrival of the French minister, who\r\nafforded Palisot the means of prosecuting inquiries into the natural\r\nhistory of America. He was employed to arrange Peale's collection. On\r\nreturning to France with his rich collections, he was admitted into the\r\nInstitute, in the place of Adanson.\r\n\r\n1824. CHARLES MACARTHY killed. He commanded at the Cape-Coast against\r\nthe Ashantees. Whilst making preparations to repel these savages in\r\n1821, the king sent his compliments to him, and said he hoped to have\r\nhis head as an ornament to their great war drum. Subsequently Sir\r\nCharles marched against the enemy with a mixed force of Europeans and\r\nblacks; the latter ran away, and the whites being defeated and their\r\ncommander captured, the ferocious menace was realized. The trophy\r\nhowever was afterwards recovered.\r\n\r\n1839. Great conflagration at Constantinople, in which the grand vizier's\r\npalace, called the Sublime Porte, including the ministerial and\r\nadministration offices, was destroyed. Loss estimated at 20,000,000\r\npiasters.\r\n\r\n1847. Major JAMES MORTON, died at High Hill, Virginia, aged 90.

Queen ELIZABETH granted to Thomas Tallis and William Birde an\r\nexclusive patent for printing music, for the term of twenty-one years.\r\n\r\n1683. ANTHONY ASHLEY COOPER, first earl of Shaftsbury, died. The career\r\nof this able, but dubious and versatile statesman was cast in a stormy\r\nperiod, and his acts have been severely reprehended. Yet much of it is\r\nto be attributed to the odium excited by opposing party feelings. His\r\nvices appear to have been redeemed by corresponding virtues, and had he\r\nappeared in a different age, it is likely he would have developed a\r\ndifferent character.\r\n\r\n1689. The British parliament having met under the name of a convention,\r\ndeclared that the king, James II, had abdicated the throne. William and\r\nMary succeeded him.\r\n\r\n1696.

The French under Macdonald entered Naarden, Holland.\r\n\r\n1800. GEORGE STEVENS died, best known as the editor of Shakspeare,\r\nthough to the versatility and richness of his talent there are numerous\r\ntestimonials. His literary collections were extremely curious, and as\r\nregards the days that are gone, of great value.\r\n\r\n1809. Naval action off Guadaloupe between the British frigate Cleopatra\r\nand sloop of war Hazard, and the French frigate Topaz, 40 guns.

The French forced the passage of the Sierra Morena, in Spain.\r\n\r\n1812. Madame REICHARD ascended in a balloon to a great height at\r\nKœnigsberg in Prussia.

The van of Gen.\r\nHarrison's army, about 750 men, was attacked at day break by 2000\r\nBritish and Indians under Proctor and Tecumseh. Notwithstanding the\r\nsuperiority of the latter in numbers, the Americans fought with\r\ndesperation six hours, when they surrendered. British loss, as stated by\r\nProctor, 24 killed, 128 wounded; the loss of the Indians is supposed to\r\nhave been greater.

United States privateer schooner Tomahawk 9 guns and 84 men,\r\ncaptured by the British ship Bulwark.\r\n\r\n1818. CASPAR WISTAR died, a distinguished physician of Philadelphia. He\r\nwas of German parentage, and a member of the society of Friends; became\r\neminent as an anatomist, and corresponded with Cuvier and other eminent\r\nnaturalists of Europe. He held scientific meetings at his own house, and\r\nwas an active contributer to knowledge of all kinds. He died of a slow\r\nfever, caught by attending a poor family in a close apartment.\r\n\r\n1822. JOHN JULIUS ANGERSTEIN died, celebrated as the founder of the\r\nBritish national gallery, which was purchased by the government after\r\nhis death for £40,000, (_Cyclopedia Americana_ says £60,000) and was\r\nfirst exhibited in May, 1824. He was born at St. Petersburg, 1735.\r\n\r\n1830. Great fire at Pera, Constantinople, extinguished by the exertions\r\nof the crew of an English ship.\r\n\r\n1834. Great earthquake in South-America; the cities of Popayan and Pasto\r\nalmost entirely destroyed, and many lives lost.\r\n\r\n1835. ANDREW WALLACE died at New York, aged 105. He emigrated from\r\nScotland in 1752, enlisted in the American army in 1776, and continued\r\nin it till 1813, when he was honorably discharged, on account of his\r\ndisability, having suffered a stroke of paralysis.\r\n\r\n1840. JOHN FREDERICK BLUMENBACH died at Göttingen, aged 88. He was long\r\na distinguished professor at the university, and a very eminent\r\nnaturalist. His collection of skulls was said to be the richest in the\r\nworld. The 50th year of his professorship was celebrated in 1826.\r\n\r\n1849. JOHN C. CALHOUN'S draft of an address to the people of the United\r\nStates adopted in preference to Berrien's, and the Southern convention\r\nadjourned sine die.\r\n\r\n1854. PATRICK O'DONAHOE died at Brooklyn, N. Y.; one of the Irish exiles\r\nwho escaped from Van Diemen's Land.\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 23.\r\n\r\n1401. TAMERLANE introduced his troops into the city of Damascus, in\r\nviolation of a truce; and after levying an enormous contribution in\r\ngold, massacred the inhabitants, and reduced the city to ashes, in\r\nrevenge of the murder of the grandson of Mahomet, seven centuries\r\nbefore, by the Syrians.\r\n\r\n1516. FERDINAND V of Spain died. He inherited the crowns of Aragon and\r\nSicily, and united to them the kingdom of Castile by marriage. In 1492\r\nhe added to these the kingdom of Granada, the last possession of the\r\nMoors, by conquest; at the same time Columbus was discovering for him\r\nthe new world. By force and treachery he acquired the kingdom of Naples,\r\nand by similar means Navarre was also added to his dominions. Thus the\r\nwhole of Spain was united under him; so that he may be considered as the\r\nrestorer if not the founder of the Spanish monarchy. He was the most\r\npowerful monarch of his time; but his conduct was characterized by a\r\ntotal want of faith, and a recklessness of principle of which he made no\r\nscruple of boasting. He was the founder of that fearful tribunal, the\r\nInquisition.\r\n\r\n1570. Earl MURRAY, regent of Scotland, shot by Hamilton of\r\nBothwellhaugh. The latter, after the battle of Langside hill, had been\r\ncondemned to death as a rebel, and pardoned. A part of his estate,\r\nhowever, was bestowed upon one of the regent's favorites, who seized\r\nHamilton's house and turned his wife out into the fields naked in a cold\r\nnight, by which she became deranged. This injury induced him to seek\r\nrevenge on the regent, after which he escaped to France.\r\n\r\n1722. HENRI DE BOULAINVILLIERS, count of St. Saire in Normandy, died.\r\nHaving finished his studies he entered the army, which however, he soon\r\nleft to devote his attention to literature. A marked antipathy to\r\nrevelation pervades his writings, and exhibits itself in singular\r\ncontrast with a superstitious reverence for judicial astrology, and the\r\nmystic sciences, which he cultivated with much diligence.\r\n\r\n1733. O. S. Birthday of BENJAMIN LINCOLN, a revolutionary general, at\r\nHingham, Mass. Great reliance was placed in his abilities by Washington,\r\nand many important commissions entrusted to him. In 1781 he was\r\nappointed secretary of war, which office he held three years, and then\r\nretired to his farm. He died 1810.\r\n\r\n1761. Action between the British frigate Minerva, 22 guns, Capt. Hood,\r\nand French ship Warwick, 34 guns, M. de Bellair, near cape Pinas, which\r\nresulted in the capture of the latter.

WILLIAM CASLON, an eminent English type founder, died. He was\r\ninduced to attempt letter-cutting by a friend, and such was the\r\nperfection to which he carried the art, that the beauty of his type\r\nexceeded all others of the day, and was sought for from other countries\r\non the continent. He was employed to cut characters for several\r\nlanguages of Asia.\r\n\r\n1772. Mrs. CLUM died near Litchfield, England, aged 138. She had lived\r\n103 years in one house.\r\n\r\n1775.

Her works consist of novels, periodicals, tragedies,\r\nmusical dramas, and translations.\r\n\r\n1789. JOHN CLELAND died; author of the notoriously immoral romance,\r\n_Fanny Hill_.\r\n\r\n1790. The mutineers of the ship Bounty having arrived at Pitcairn's\r\nisland, and landed all their effects, set fire to the vessel and\r\ndestroyed every vestige that could lead to the discovery of their\r\nretreat. The island was then divided into nine equal portions between\r\nthem, and the natives were reduced to the condition of slaves. (See Oct.\r\n3.)\r\n\r\n1795. JOHN SULLIVAN, a distinguished general in the revolutionary army,\r\ndied. He was of Irish descent, and before the revolution practiced law\r\nin New Hampshire. He was among the first to take an active part in the\r\ncontest; resigned his seat in the first congress to enter the army; was\r\nconspicuous at several engagements; and terminated his military career\r\nin laying waste the country of the Six Nations, in order to put a stop\r\nto their depredations. After the peace he filled several important state\r\noffices.\r\n\r\n1795. The French took possession of the Hague and Helvoetsluis, made 800\r\nEnglishmen prisoners, and liberated 600 Frenchmen.\r\n\r\n1799. The French under Championnet entered Naples.\r\n\r\n1800. A convention signed between Gen. Kleber and the grand vizier for\r\nthe evacuation of Egypt by the French troops.\r\n\r\n1800. EDWARD RUTLEDGE, one of the signers of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, died. He was a member of the first congress and acted a\r\nconspicuous part during the war. While the British beleaguered\r\nCharleston, his native city, he commanded a company of troops, and was\r\ntaken prisoner. On the restoration of peace he returned to the practice\r\nof law, and a short time previous to his death was elected governor of\r\nthe state of South Carolina.\r\n\r\n1802. HUMBOLDT and his companions ascended Chimborazo to the height of\r\n18,576 feet above the surface of the sea. The blood started from their\r\neyes, lips and gums, and they became almost torpid with cold. A narrow\r\ndeep valley prevented them from reaching the summit, which was 1344 feet\r\nhigher.\r\n\r\n1806. WILLIAM PITT, second son of the earl of Chatham, died. He was born\r\n1759, and at the age of 23 became chancellor of the exchequer and the\r\nnext year prime minister. It was during the early part of his career\r\nthat the American war was concluded. Notwithstanding the emoluments of\r\nhis offices were great, so far from acquiring wealth, he died involved.\r\nParliament decreed him a public funeral, and £40,000 to pay his debts.\r\n\r\n1813. GEORGE CLYMER, one of the signers of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, died. By the death of his parents he was left an orphan at\r\nthe age of 7 years; but he was taken care of by his uncle, who left him\r\na large fortune, with which to continue the business of a merchant in\r\nPhiladelphia. His services to the country during the revolution, in\r\nraising supplies and devising ways and means to continue the struggle,\r\nwere of incalculable importance.\r\n\r\n1813. Horrible massacre of the United States prisoners taken by the\r\nBritish and Indians at the battle of Frenchtown the day before. The\r\nhouses in which the helpless wounded lay were set on fire, and those who\r\nwere too feeble to continue the march were shot or tomahawked on the\r\nroad. It is morally certain that the British generals Proctor and\r\nElliott were culpable for this wanton sacrifice of human life to satiate\r\nthe revenge of the savages.\r\n\r\n1813. ROBERT JAMISON died in South Carolina, aged 104. His eyesight,\r\nwhich had failed him some years previous to his decease, returned again\r\njust before his death in all its strength.\r\n\r\n1815. Thanksgiving day in New Orleans, and a solemn _Te Deum_ on account\r\nof Jackson's victory.\r\n\r\n1820. EDWARD, duke of Kent, died. He was the fourth son of George III.\r\nIn 1802 he was appointed governor of Gibraltar, but his rigid discipline\r\nproduced a mutiny, and he was recalled.

CAIUS CALIGULA, the Roman emperor, assassinated. He commenced his\r\nreign with every promise of becoming a good monarch. But at the end of\r\neight months he was attacked with a fever, which appears to have left a\r\nfrenzy upon his mind, for his disposition was totally reversed.

He was\r\nborn in Connecticut and had a good elementary education; but in his\r\nyouth acquired vicious habits which however he overcame at about the age\r\nof 14. At an early age he believed himself called to preach, and in\r\nobeying the impulse he commenced a career which has probably never been\r\nequaled; and in spite of acute bodily disease performed an amount of\r\nlabor in traveling and preaching never before known. Before he had\r\ncompleted his twenty-fifth year, he once rode 1500 miles and held 184\r\nmeetings in ten weeks and two days; and about a year afterwards,\r\ntraveled 4000 miles in the southern states, constantly preaching, in\r\nseven months, and finished his tour without stockings, shoes, or outer\r\ngarment, and almost without a horse. For several years after he traveled\r\nfrom seven to ten thousand miles and held six or seven hundred meetings\r\nannually. It is thought that during the thirty-eight years of his public\r\nlife he must have traveled two hundred thousand miles, including three\r\nvoyages to England and Ireland. During these flying journeys he\r\nconstantly refused donations and contributions, except for immediate\r\nwant; and his traveling expenses exceeded his receipts more than one\r\nhalf, the first eighteen years. Afterwards, however, his books became a\r\nsource of profit to him, and finally he became the maker and vender of a\r\n_family medicine!_ which was a matter of speculation purely. He was\r\ntwice married; his second wife survived him. He was familiar to every\r\nbody throughout the United States, for there were few places however\r\nobscure which he had not visited.\r\n\r\n1839. DEBORAH LOGAN died at Stanton, Pa.

STEPHEN LEAKE, an ingenious writer on coins and heraldry, died at\r\nThorp, England.\r\n\r\n1776. JOHN HARRISON, an eminent English mechanic, died.

This occasioned great perplexity and\r\nconfusion of dates, arising from the computations by the old and new\r\nstyles.\r\n\r\n1754. WILLIAM HAMILTON, an ingenious Scottish poet, died. His pieces are\r\ndistinguished for liveliness of imagination and delicacy of sentiment.\r\n\r\n1761. The first tree cut towards clearing land for cultivation in the\r\ntown of Bennington, Vt.

Several expensive expeditions\r\nwere fitted out by him, of overland journeys, to the Pacific, some of\r\nwhich were executed by individuals with great suffering. For many years\r\nprevious to the war of 1812, and subsequently, Mr. Astor was extensively\r\nengaged in the Canton trade, and during the war was so fortunate that\r\nseveral of his ships arrived here with valuable cargoes in safety. The\r\nprofits on those ships were enormous. Mr. Astor made large investments\r\nin American stocks, which he purchased during the war with Great\r\nBritain, at sixty to seventy cents on the dollar, and which after the\r\npeace, went up to twenty per cent. above par.

DRAKE, the navigator, was knighted on board his famous ship, the\r\nPelican, at Deptford.\r\n\r\n1588. FREDERICK II, of Denmark, died.

He was secretary of\r\nstate to James I, and published some curious anecdotes of the reign of\r\nElizabeth, under the title of _Fragmentia Regalia_.\r\n\r\n1638. Massachusetts patent demanded. A quo warranto having been brought\r\nby the attorney general of England against the governor and corporation\r\nof Massachusetts, and judgment given that the liberties and franchises\r\nshould be seized into the king's hand, the council made an order\r\nrequiring that the charter should be returned by the next ship.\r\nArbitrary measures were pursued in reply to the petitions of the colony,\r\nand 8 ships prepared to sail for New England were detained in the Thames\r\nby order of the privy council. By this order, Oliver Cromwell, Arthur\r\nHazelrig, John Hambden and other malcontents, were forcibly prevented\r\nfrom emigrating to America. How little did Charles anticipate that by\r\nthis high-handed measure he was detaining the very men who were destined\r\nto overturn his throne, and terminate his career by a violent death.\r\n\r\n1643. SIMON EPISCOPIUS, an able Dutch divine, died. He embraced the\r\ndoctrines of Arminius in relation to predestination, which exposed him\r\nto much persecution and obloquy, and finally led to his banishment from\r\nthe commonwealth: he afterwards was permitted to return, and became\r\nminister of the remonstrant church. His death happening at the moment of\r\nan eclipse of the moon, was considered as an emblem of the departure of\r\nthe brightest ornament of the church.\r\n\r\n1656.

H.) attacked by a large body of\r\nFrench and Indians under M. Debeline, and gallantly defended by 30 men,\r\nunder major Stevens. The enemy kept up a brisk assault night and day;\r\nwhen, on the third day, being in a starving condition, and finding it\r\nimpracticable to force or persuade a surrender, they retired and were\r\nseen no more. This was considered one of the most chivalrous feats of\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\n1764. MICHAEL LOMONOZOF, a Russian poet, died. From the occupation of a\r\nfishmonger he rose to be the \"father of Russian poetry,\" and a\r\nphilosopher of no mean pretensions.

He received a partial education at\r\nDublin college, after which he strayed from home, and making a tour on\r\nthe continent, afoot and alone, with a flute in his hand, fixed himself,\r\non his return, in London, as a _builder of books_. The details of his\r\nlife are interesting, chequered as they are with vicissitudes. As a\r\nbookseller's hack he was particularly successful; but the liberality of\r\nhis disposition and want of economy, contributed to keep him in want,\r\nand sometimes brought him to starvation. He died about £2,000 in debt.\r\nHis works, though most of them were produced on the spur of the moment,\r\nto procure the necessaries of life, are still found in almost every\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\n1777. JOHN SWINTON, an English antiquary, died.

JOSEPH JEROME LA FRANCAIS DE LALANDE died at Paris, aged 70. He\r\nreceived a minute religious education, and displayed his abilities while\r\nquite young by his sermons and mystical romances.

He became editor of the\r\n_Connaissance des Temps_, published several works on astronomy, and\r\nwrote all the astronomical articles for the great _Encyclopedie_. In\r\n1778 he published a folio volume on canals, containing a general\r\nhistory of all the ancient canals which had been previously undertaken,\r\naccomplished and even projected.

A few days after that\r\naffair he removed his paper to Worcester; and gradually established\r\npresses and book-stores in different parts of the Union, to the number\r\nof twenty-four; so that he nearly supplied the entire country with\r\nbooks.

He was the pupil of\r\nSocrates, and on the death of his master went into foreign countries in\r\nsearch of knowledge.

JOHN STOW, an English antiquary and historian, died, aged 80. He\r\nwas born in London, 1525, and initiated by his father into all the\r\nmysteries of tailoring as practiced at that period. But he discovered a\r\npenchant for musty relics and antiquarian lumber, and finally quitted\r\nhis business to compose a history of England. He at length got together\r\nsuch a medley of antique and diabolical books and parchments, that he\r\nbecame suspected of some heretical designs against religion, so that the\r\nbishop of London ordered an investigation of his library. He published\r\n_A Summarie of the Englyshe Chronicles_, and in 1598 a _Survey of\r\nLondon_, on which he was long employed, and which has been often\r\nreprinted.

The government of France was\r\nnow almost entirely vested in one man, under whose sanguinary\r\nadministration the prisons of Paris contained at one time more than\r\nseven thousand persons, and a day seldom passed without sixty or eighty\r\nexecutions by the revolutionary axe.\r\n\r\n1794.

This cemetery had been used more than a\r\nthousand years by twenty parishes, and it is estimated that more than\r\nthree millions of people had been inhumed within its inclosures. In\r\nprocess of time, as the city extended, palaces and churches were built\r\nover the subterranean caverns, and were in imminent danger of sinking\r\ninto the pit below, before it was again discovered. The mighty city of\r\nParis had until now but one burial place, where a pit was dug, and the\r\nbodies laid side by side, without any earth being put over them, till\r\nthe first tier was full; then a thin layer of earth covered them, and\r\nanother tier of dead came on; thus by layer upon layer, and dead upon\r\ndead, the hole was filled up. These pits were emptied every thirty or\r\nforty years to receive new tenants. The last grave digger, Francis\r\nPontraci, had by his own register, in less than thirty years, inhumed\r\nmore than 90,000 bodies in that ground.

REMUS, the brother of Romulus, slain by the workmen who were\r\nbuilding Rome, for ridiculing the weakness of the walls.

C. DIOGENES, _the cynic_, died at Corinth, aged 90. He was\r\nexpelled from his native city, Synope, for coining false money.

He was a\r\nman of great learning, and was the first king who had the public\r\ndocuments written in Spanish, which he did with a view to polish and\r\nenrich the language.

The battle is\r\nsaid to have been one of the most splendid which the art of war could\r\ndisplay. The Austrian army, of upwards of 100,000 men, were dispossessed\r\nof all their positions, by the combined attack of the French, whose\r\ndivisions appeared on the field, each in its due place and order, as\r\nregularly as the movements of the various pieces in the game of chess.\r\nThe battle commenced at two in the afternoon and continued till\r\nnightfall.

Brazil discovered by PEDRO ALVAREZ CABRAL, a Portuguese\r\nadventurer; who immediately sent home a ship with the intelligence, and\r\nthe king took possession of it. But as the pope had given all the\r\nwestern infidels to the Spaniards, it is probable a great deal of\r\ntrouble would have arisen out of the case, had not the two monarchs been\r\nkinsmen and friends.\r\n\r\n1547. Battle of Mulhausen, in which the emperor Charles V defeated the\r\nSaxons, who lost 1200 killed, and the elector was wounded and taken\r\nprisoner.\r\n\r\n1557.

The colony of New Haven was included in the charter, but did not\r\nconsent to be united with the other colonies under one government. The\r\nfact was, they considered their civil and religious code rather superior\r\nto any thing else of the kind in the world, and were exceedingly jealous\r\nof contamination.\r\n\r\n1676. Engagement off Aosta, in Sicily, between the French fleet under\r\nadmiral du Quesne, and the Dutch fleet under De Ruyter, who was mortally\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\n1709.

The Austrians, having sustained defeat and\r\nlosses four days successively, made some attempt to fortify this city,\r\nin order to protect the retreat of the army. The French, who had\r\nadvanced to the storm, were cut down by the musquetry of the besieged.\r\nThere was at length difficulty in finding volunteers to renew the\r\nattack, when the impetuous Lannes, by whom they were commanded, seized a\r\nladder and rushed forward to fix it himself against the wall. \"I will\r\nshow,\" exclaimed he, \"that your general is still a grenadier.\" The\r\nFrench rallied and carried the ramparts--the contest was renewed in the\r\nstreet, and the city fired. The Austrians were driven out of Ratisbon,\r\nleaving cannon, baggage and prisoners in the hands of the French. Thus\r\nin five days, in spite of the inferiority of numbers and the imperfect\r\nmanner in which his troops were combined, Bonaparte, by the sole energy\r\nof his genius, triumphed over the main forces of his opponent, and\r\nopened the road to his capital. At no period of his momentous career,\r\nsays Scott, did the genius of Napoleon appear more completely to\r\nprostrate all opposition; at no time did the talents of a single\r\nindividual exercise such an influence on the fate of the universe.\r\n\r\n1810. Fort Matagorda, having bean reduced to a heap of ruins, was\r\nevacuated by the British, in consequence of which the French were\r\nenabled to bombard Cadiz; 500 officers and 900 men fell into the hands\r\nof the French.\r\n\r\n1810.

Destruction of the Bastile, at Paris. This awful fortress of\r\ndespotism, of which the name had for ages inspired terror, and which had\r\nwithstood a vigorous siege about two centuries previous, was invested by\r\na mixed multitude of citizens and soldiers. De Launay, the governor,\r\ndisplayed a flag of truce and demanded a parley, but abusing the\r\nconfidence which that signal inspired, he discharged a heavy fire of\r\ncannon and musketry on the besiegers. This act of treachery, so far from\r\nintimidating the people, inflamed their rage and rendered them\r\ndesperate. They renewed the attack with frenzy, and carried the prison\r\nby assault. The governor was seized and massacred, and his head carried\r\nin triumph through the streets. The Bastile was razed to the ground, and\r\nwith it the despotism of the French monarchy fell prostrate in the dust.\r\nIt cost 200,000 livres to demolish this edifice to its foundations, and\r\nthe materials were sold for 36,000.\r\n\r\n1790.

This magnificent work was\r\ndesigned for the retirement of a prince celebrated for his magnificent\r\ntaste, and were it possible to rescue it from its present position, or\r\nexamine the interior, many valuable relics might be brought to light, to\r\nenrich the cabinet of the antiquarian if not to subserve the use of the\r\nsciences.\r\n\r\n1546.

King PHILIP (or _Metacom_), killed at Mount Hope, in Rhode Island,\r\nwhither he had been driven by the English, as a last refuge. One of his\r\nconfederates proposing peace, so irritated Philip that he killed him. A\r\nbrother of the murdered Indian repaired to the English camp, and offered\r\nto lead them to Philip's retreat. Captain Church set out with a small\r\nbody of men, accompanied by a few friendly Indians, and attacked the\r\nchief in his den. He formed his men in extended order, placing an\r\nEnglishman and an indian together, with orders to fire on any who should\r\nattempt to escape. At the dawn of day the sentinels alarmed the camp,\r\nwhen Philip seized his arms and attempted to escape; as he approached\r\ntwo of Church's guards, the Englishman leveled his gun, which missed\r\nfire; the Indian sent two balls through his body, one of which piercing\r\nhis heart, laid him dead upon the spot. When the battle was over, the\r\nEnglish repaired to the place where he lay. He had fallen on his face in\r\na muddy spot of the ground, from which he was drawn; the head was taken\r\noff and the body left to be devoured by wild beasts. Thus fell a\r\npowerful chief, and a ferocious savage. It was then hailed with joy as\r\nthe extinction of a virulent and implacable enemy; but is now often\r\nviewed as the fall of a great statesman and a mighty prince, who died in\r\ndefence of his just rights. This was a war of extermination; it was a\r\ngeneral rising of the Indians, under a powerful and sagacious warrior,\r\nagainst the English, not a vestige of whom would have been left had they\r\nbeen victorious. As it was, several of the tribes were annihilated; a\r\nmiserable remnant of the others incorporated themselves with distant and\r\nstrange nations. In this short but tremendous war, about 600 of the\r\nwhite inhabitants, composing its principal strength, were either killed\r\nin battle or murdered; 12 towns entirely destroyed, and 600 dwellings\r\nburnt. The English triumphed, indeed, but the ravages of the enemy left\r\nthem in a deplorable condition.\r\n\r\n1689. INNOCENT XI (_Benedict Odescalchi_), pope, died.

He\r\nwas a Jesuit, and a principal agent in instigating the Indians against\r\nthe English colonies; had resided at this place twenty-six years, and\r\nbecome thoroughly acquainted with the country. An expedition was fitted\r\nout to destroy his den. The place was attacked by 240 men, and carried.\r\nRalle was found in his cabin firing upon the English; orders had been\r\ngiven to take him alive, if possible; but refusing to ask quarter he was\r\nshot down. Eighty were killed, among which were some of the most noted\r\nwarriors of the tribe, and the remnant scattered. Ralle was a man of\r\nextensive learning, and of great service to the French; he wrote a\r\ndictionary of the Norridgewock language, which was taken, and is\r\ndeposited in Harvard library. He was sent out as a missionary, had\r\nacquired the languages of nearly all the tribes in America, and spent\r\nthirty-seven years among them.\r\n\r\n1728.

It was not, however, till\r\nafter seventy-five days of fierce and almost daily fighting, that he\r\naccomplished his victory. On no occasion did native Americans so bravely\r\noppose European troops; but the superior discipline of the Spaniards\r\ncarried the day: and thus a daring adventurer, regarded and treated by\r\nhis countrymen as a rebel, after a bloody struggle, gained possession of\r\na country which for more than three centuries formed one of the\r\nbrightest gems in the Castilian crown.

The Languedoc of 90 guns, count d'Estaing's flag ship, having lost\r\nher rudder and masts in the storm of the day before, was attacked by the\r\nBritish ship Renown, 50 guns, which was beaten off.
