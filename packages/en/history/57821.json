BRADFORD.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUBURN:\r\nW. J. MOSES, PRINTER.\r\n\r\n1869.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HARRIET TUBMAN.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEntered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1869,\r\n\r\nBY WILLIAM G. WISE,\r\n\r\nIn the Clerk's Office of the District Court for the Northern District\r\nof New York.\r\n\r\nSTEREOTYPED BY\r\nDENNIS BRO'S & CO.,\r\nAUBURN, N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following little story was written by Mrs. Sarah H. Bradford, of\r\nGeneva, with the single object of furnishing some help to the subject of\r\nthe memoir. Harriet Tubman's services and sufferings during the\r\nrebellion, which are acknowledged in the letters of Gen. Saxton, and\r\nothers, it was thought by many, would justify the bestowment of a\r\npension by the Government. But the difficulties in the way of procuring\r\nsuch relief, suggested other methods, and finally the present one. The\r\nnarrative was prepared on the eve of the author's departure for Europe,\r\nwhere she still remains. It makes no claim whatever to literary merit.\r\nHer hope was merely that the considerably numerous public already in\r\npart acquainted with Harriet's story, would furnish purchasers enough to\r\nsecure a little fund for the relief of this remarkable woman. Outside\r\nthat circle she did not suppose the memoir was likely to meet with much\r\nif any sale.\r\n\r\nIn furtherance of the same benevolent scheme, and in order to secure the\r\nwhole avails of the work for Harriet's benefit, a subscription has been\r\nraised more than sufficient to defray the entire cost of publication.\r\nThis has been effected by the generous exertions of Wm. G. Wise, Esq.,\r\nof this city. The whole amount was contributed by citizens of Auburn,\r\nwith the exception of two liberal subscriptions by Gerrit Smith, Esq.,\r\nand Mr. Wendell Phillips.\r\n\r\nMr. Wise has also consented, at Mrs. Bradford's request, to act as\r\ntrustee for Harriet; and will receive, invest, and apply, for her\r\nbenefit, whatever may accrue from the sale of this book.\r\n\r\nThe spirited wood-cut likeness of Harriet, in her costume as scout, was\r\nfurnished by the kindness of Mr. J. C. Darby, of this city.\r\n\r\nS. M. H.\r\n\r\nAUBURN, Dec. 1, 1868.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is proposed in this little book to give a plain and unvarnished\r\naccount of some scenes and adventures in the life of a woman who, though\r\none of earth's lowly ones, and of dark-hued skin, has shown an amount of\r\nheroism in her character rarely possessed by those of any station in\r\nlife. Her name (we say it advisedly and without exaggeration) deserves\r\nto be handed down to posterity side by side with the names of Joan of\r\nArc, Grace Darling, and Florence Nightingale; for not one of these women\r\nhas shown more courage and power of endurance in facing danger and death\r\nto relieve human suffering, than has this woman in her heroic and\r\nsuccessful endeavors to reach and save all whom she might of her\r\noppressed and suffering race, and to pilot them from the land of Bondage\r\nto the promised land of Liberty. Well has she been called \"_Moses_,\" for\r\nshe has been a leader and deliverer unto hundreds of her people.\r\n\r\nWorn down by her sufferings and fatigues, her health permanently\r\naffected by the cruelties to which she has been subjected, she is still\r\nlaboring to the utmost limit of her strength for the support of her aged\r\nparents, and still also for her afflicted people--by her own efforts\r\nsupporting two schools for Freedmen at the South, and supplying them\r\nwith clothes and books; never obtruding herself, never asking for\r\ncharity, except for \"her people.\"\r\n\r\nIt is for the purpose of aiding her in ministering to the wants of her\r\naged parents, and in the hope of securing to them the little home which\r\nthey are in danger of losing from inability to pay the whole amount\r\ndue--which amount was partly paid when our heroine left them to throw\r\nherself into the work of aiding our suffering soldiers--that this little\r\naccount, drawn from her by persevering endeavor, is given to the friends\r\nof humanity.\r\n\r\nThe writer of this story has till very lately known less personally of\r\nthe subject of it, than many others to whom she has for years been an\r\nobject of interest and care. But through relations and friends in\r\nAuburn, and also through Mrs. Commodore Swift of Geneva, and her\r\nsisters, who have for many years known and esteemed this wonderful\r\nwoman, she has heard tales of her deeds of heroism which seemed almost\r\ntoo strange for belief, and were invested with the charm of romance.\r\n\r\nDuring a sojourn of some months in the city of Auburn, while the war was\r\nin progress, the writer used to see occasionally in her Sunday-school\r\nclass the aged mother of Harriet, and also some of those girls who had\r\nbeen brought from the South by this remarkable woman. She also wrote\r\nletters for the old people to commanding officers at the South, making\r\ninquiries about Harriet, and received answers telling of her untiring\r\ndevotion to our wounded and sick soldiers, and of her efficient aid in\r\nvarious ways to the cause of the Union.\r\n\r\nBy the graphic pen of Mrs. Stowe, the incidents of such a life as that\r\nof the subject of this little memoir might be wrought up into a tale of\r\nthrilling interest, equaling, if not exceeding, anything in her\r\nworld-renowned \"Uncle Tom's Cabin;\" but the story of Harriet Tubman\r\nneeds not the drapery of fiction; the bare unadorned facts are enough to\r\nstir the hearts of the friends of humanity, the friends of liberty, the\r\nlovers of their country.\r\n\r\nThere are those who will sneer, there are those who have already done\r\nso, at this _quixotic attempt_ to make a heroine of a black woman, and a\r\nslave; but it may possibly be that there are some natures, though\r\nconcealed under fairer skins, who have not the capacity to comprehend\r\nsuch general and self-sacrificing devotion to the cause of others as\r\nthat here delineated, and therefore they resort to scorn and ridicule,\r\nin order to throw discredit upon the whole story.\r\n\r\nMuch has been left out which would have been highly interesting, because\r\nof the impossibility of substantiating by the testimony of others the\r\ntruth of Harriet's statements. But whenever it has been possible to find\r\nthose who were cognizant with the facts stated, they have been\r\ncorroborated in every particular.\r\n\r\nA few years hence and we seem to see a gathering where the wrongs of\r\nearth will be righted, and Justice, long delayed, will assert itself,\r\nand perform its office. Then not a few of those who had esteemed\r\nthemselves the wise and noble of this world, \"will begin with shame to\r\ntake the lowest place;\" while upon Harriet's dark head a kind hand will\r\nbe placed, and in her ear a gentle voice will sound, saying: \"Friend!\r\ncome up higher!\"\r\n\r\nS. H. B.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following letters to the writer from those well-known and\r\ndistinguished philanthropists, Hon. Gerrit Smith and Wendell Phillips,\r\nand one from Frederick Douglass, addressed to Harriet, will serve as the\r\nbest introduction that can be given of the subject of this memoir to its\r\nreaders:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter from Hon. Gerrit Smith._\r\n\r\n\r\n     PETERBORO, June 13, 1868.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR MADAME: I am happy to learn that you are to speak to the\r\n     public of Mrs. Harriet Tubman. Of the remarkable events of her life\r\n     I have no _personal_ knowledge, but of the truth of them as she\r\n     describes them I have no doubt.\r\n\r\n     I have often listened to her, in her visits to my family, and I am\r\n     confident that she is not only truthful, but that she has a rare\r\n     discernment, and a deep and sublime philanthropy.\r\n\r\n     With great respect your friend,\r\n\r\n     GERRIT SMITH.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter from Wendell Phillips._\r\n\r\n\r\n     JUNE 16, 1868.\r\n\r\n     DEAR MADAME: The last time I ever saw John Brown was under my own\r\n     roof, as he brought Harriet Tubman to me, saying: \"Mr. Phillips, I\r\n     bring you one of the best and bravest persons on this\r\n     continent--_General_ Tubman, as we call her.\"\r\n\r\n     He then went on to recount her labors and sacrifices in behalf of\r\n     her race. After that, Harriet spent some time in Boston, earning\r\n     the confidence and admiration of all those who were working for\r\n     freedom. With their aid she went to the South more than once,\r\n     returning always with a squad of self-emancipated men, women, and\r\n     children, for whom her marvelous skill had opened the way of\r\n     escape. After the war broke out, she was sent with indorsements\r\n     from Governor Andrew and his friends to South Carolina, where in\r\n     the service of the Nation she rendered most important and efficient\r\n     aid to our army.\r\n\r\n     In my opinion there are few captains, perhaps few colonels, who\r\n     have done more for the loyal cause since the war began, and few men\r\n     who did before that time more for the colored race, than our\r\n     fearless and most sagacious friend, Harriet.\r\n\r\n     Faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n     WENDELL PHILLIPS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter from Frederick Douglass._\r\n\r\n\r\n     ROCHESTER, August 29, 1868.\r\n\r\n     DEAR HARRIET: I am glad to know that the story of your eventful\r\n     life has been written by a kind lady, and that the same is soon to\r\n     be published. You ask for what you do not need when you call upon\r\n     me for a word of commendation. I need such words from you far more\r\n     than you can need them from me, especially where your superior\r\n     labors and devotion to the cause of the lately enslaved of our land\r\n     are known as I know them. The difference between us is very marked.\r\n     Most that I have done and suffered in the service of our cause has\r\n     been in public, and I have received much encouragement at every\r\n     step of the way. You on the other hand have labored in a private\r\n     way. I have wrought in the day--you in the night. I have had the\r\n     applause of the crowd and the satisfaction that comes of being\r\n     approved by the multitude, while the most that you have done has\r\n     been witnessed by a few trembling, scared, and foot-sore bondmen\r\n     and women, whom you have led out of the house of bondage, and whose\r\n     heartfelt \"_God bless you_\" has been your only reward. The midnight\r\n     sky and the silent stars have been the witnesses of your devotion\r\n     to freedom and of your heroism. Excepting John Brown--of sacred\r\n     memory--I know of no one who has willingly encountered more perils\r\n     and hardships to serve our enslaved people than you have. Much that\r\n     you have done would seem improbable to those who do not know you\r\n     as I know you. It is to me a great pleasure and a great privilege\r\n     to bear testimony to your character and your works, and to say to\r\n     those to whom you may come, that I regard you in every way truthful\r\n     and trustworthy.\r\n\r\n     Your friend,\r\n\r\n     FREDERICK DOUGLASS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME SCENES\r\n\r\nIN THE\r\n\r\nLIFE OF HARRIET TUBMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nHarriet Tubman, known at various times, and in various places, by many\r\ndifferent names, such as \"Moses,\" in allusion to her being the leader\r\nand guide to so many of her people in their exodus from the Land of\r\nBondage; \"the Conductor of the Underground Railroad;\" and \"Moll\r\nPitcher,\" for the energy and daring by which she delivered a fugitive\r\nslave who was about to be dragged back to the South; was for the first\r\ntwenty-five years of her life a slave on the eastern shore of Maryland.\r\nHer own master she represents as never unnecessarily cruel; but as was\r\ncommon among slaveholders, he often hired out his slaves to others, some\r\nof whom proved to be tyrannical and brutal to the utmost limit of their\r\npower.\r\n\r\nShe had worked only as a field-hand for many years, following the oxen,\r\nloading and unloading wood, and carrying heavy burdens, by which her\r\nnaturally remarkable power of muscle was so developed that her feats of\r\nstrength often called forth the wonder of strong laboring men. Thus was\r\nshe preparing for the life of hardship and endurance which lay before\r\nher, for the deeds of daring she was to do, and of which her ignorant\r\nand darkened mind at that time never dreamed.\r\n\r\nThe first person by whom she was hired was a woman who, though married\r\nand the mother of a family, was still \"Miss Susan\" to her slaves, as is\r\ncustomary at the South. This woman was possessed of the good things of\r\nthis life, and provided liberally for her slaves--so far as food and\r\nclothing went. But she had been brought up to believe, and to act upon\r\nthe belief, that a slave could be taught to do nothing, and _would_ do\r\nnothing but under the sting of the whip. Harriet, then a young girl, was\r\ntaken from her life in the field, and having never seen the inside of a\r\nhouse better than a cabin in the negro quarters, was put to house-work\r\nwithout being told how to do anything. The first thing was to put a\r\nparlor in order. \"Move these chairs and tables into the middle of the\r\nroom, sweep the carpet clean, then dust everything, and put them back in\r\ntheir places!\" These were the directions given, and Harriet was left\r\nalone to do her work. The whip was in sight on the mantel-piece, as a\r\nreminder of what was to be expected if the work was not done well.\r\nHarriet fixed the furniture as she was told to do, and swept with all\r\nher strength, raising a tremendous dust. The moment she had finished\r\nsweeping, she took her dusting cloth, and wiped everything \"so you could\r\nsee your face in 'em, de shone so,\" in haste to go and set the table for\r\nbreakfast, and do her other work. The dust which she had set flying only\r\nsettled down again on chairs, tables, and the piano. \"Miss Susan\" came\r\nin and looked around. Then came the call for \"Minty\"--Harriet's name was\r\nAraminta at the South.\r\n\r\nShe drew her up to the table, saying, \"What do you mean by doing my work\r\nthis way, you--!\" and passing her finger on the table and piano, she\r\nshowed her the mark it made through the dust. \"Miss Susan, I done sweep\r\nand dust jus' as you tole me.\" But the whip was already taken down, and\r\nthe strokes were falling on head and face and neck. Four times this\r\nscene was repeated before breakfast, when, during the fifth whipping,\r\nthe door opened, and \"Miss Emily\" came in. She was a married sister of\r\n\"Miss Susan,\" and was making her a visit, and though brought up with the\r\nsame associations as her sister, seems to have been a person of more\r\ngentle and reasonable nature. Not being able to endure the screams of\r\nthe child any longer, she came in, took her sister by the arm, and said,\r\n\"If you do not stop whipping that child, I will leave your house, and\r\nnever come back!\" Miss Susan declared that \"she _would_ not mind, and\r\nshe slighted her work on purpose.\" Miss Emily said, \"Leave her to me a\r\nfew moments;\" and Miss Susan left the room, indignant. As soon as they\r\nwere alone, Miss Emily said: \"Now, Minty, show me how you do your work.\"\r\nFor the sixth time Harriet removed all the furniture into the middle of\r\nthe room; then she swept; and the moment she had done sweeping, she took\r\nthe dusting cloth to wipe off the furniture. \"Now stop there,\" said Miss\r\nEmily; \"go away now, and do some of your other work, and when it is time\r\nto dust, I will call you.\" When the time came she called her, and\r\nexplained to her how the dust had now settled, and that if she wiped it\r\noff now, the furniture would remain bright and clean. These few words an\r\nhour or two before, would have saved Harriet her whippings for that day,\r\nas they probably did for many a day after.\r\n\r\nWhile with this woman, after working from early morning till late at\r\nnight, she was obliged to sit up all night to rock a cross, sick child.\r\nHer mistress laid upon her bed with a whip under her pillow, and slept;\r\nbut if the tired nurse forgot herself for a moment, if her weary head\r\ndropped, and her hand ceased to rock the cradle, the child would cry\r\nout, and then down would come the whip upon the neck and face of the\r\npoor weary creature. The scars are still plainly visible where the whip\r\ncut into the flesh. Perhaps her mistress was preparing her, though she\r\ndid not know it then, by this enforced habit of wakefulness, for the\r\nmany long nights of travel, when she was the leader and guide of the\r\nweary and hunted ones who were escaping from bondage.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Susan\" got tired of Harriet, as Harriet was determined she should\r\ndo, and so abandoned her intention of buying her, and sent her back to\r\nher master. She was next hired out to the man who inflicted upon her the\r\nlife-long injury from which she is suffering now, by breaking her skull\r\nwith a weight from the scales. The injury thus inflicted causes her\r\noften to fall into a state of somnolency from which it is almost\r\nimpossible to rouse her. Disabled and sick, her flesh all wasted away,\r\nshe was returned to her _owner_. He tried to sell her, but no one would\r\nbuy her. \"Dey said dey wouldn't give a sixpence for me,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"And so,\" she said, \"from Christmas till March I worked as I could, and\r\nI _prayed_ through all the long nights--I groaned and prayed for ole\r\nmaster: 'Oh Lord, convert master!' 'Oh Lord, change dat man's heart!'\r\n'Pears like I prayed all de time,\" said Harriet; \"'bout my work,\r\neverywhere, I prayed an' I groaned to de Lord. When I went to de\r\nhorse-trough to wash my face, I took up de water in my han' an' I said,\r\n'Oh Lord, wash me, make me clean!' Den I take up something to wipe my\r\nface, an' I say, 'Oh Lord, wipe away all my sin!' When I took de broom\r\nand began to sweep, I groaned, 'Oh Lord, wha'soebber sin dere be in my\r\nheart, sweep it out, Lord, clar an' clean!'\" No words can describe the\r\npathos of her tones, as she broke out into these words of prayer, after\r\nthe manner of her people. \"An' so,\" said she, \"I prayed all night long\r\nfor master, till the first of March; an' all the time he was bringing\r\npeople to look at me, an' trying to sell me. Den we heard dat some of us\r\nwas gwine to be sole to go wid de chain-gang down to de cotton an' rice\r\nfields, and dey said I was gwine, an' my brudders, an' sisters. Den I\r\nchanged my prayer. Fust of March I began to pray, 'Oh Lord, if you ant\r\nnebber gwine to change dat man's heart, kill him, Lord, an' take him out\r\nob de way.'\r\n\r\n\"Nex' ting I heard old master was dead, an' he died jus' as he libed.\r\nOh, then, it 'peared like I'd give all de world full ob gold, if I had\r\nit, to bring dat poor soul back. But I couldn't pray for him no longer.\"\r\n\r\nThe slaves were told that their master's will provided that none of them\r\nshould be sold out of the State. This satisfied most of them, and they\r\nwere very happy. But Harriet was not satisfied; she never closed her\r\neyes that she did not imagine she saw the horsemen coming, and heard the\r\nscreams of women and children, as they were being dragged away to a far\r\nworse slavery than that they were enduring there. Harriet was married at\r\nthis time to a free negro, who not only did not trouble himself about\r\nher fears, but did his best to betray her, and bring her back after she\r\nescaped. She would start up at night with the cry, \"Oh, dey're comin',\r\ndey're comin', I mus' go!\"\r\n\r\nHer husband called her a fool, and said she was like old Cudjo, who when\r\na joke went round, never laughed till half an hour after everybody else\r\ngot through, and so just as all danger was past she began to be\r\nfrightened. But still Harriet in fancy saw the horsemen coming, and\r\nheard the screams of terrified women and children. \"And all that time,\r\nin my dreams and visions,\" she said, \"I seemed to see a line, and on the\r\nother side of that line were green fields, and lovely flowers, and\r\nbeautiful white ladies, who stretched out their arms to me over the\r\nline, but I couldn't reach them nohow. I always fell before I got to the\r\nline.\"\r\n\r\nOne Saturday it was whispered in the quarters that two of Harriet's\r\nsisters had been sent off with the chain-gang. That morning she started,\r\nhaving persuaded three of her brothers to accompany her, but they had\r\nnot gone far when the brothers, appalled by the dangers before and\r\nbehind them, determined to go back, and in spite of her remonstrances\r\ndragged her with them. In fear and terror, she remained over Sunday, and\r\non Monday night a negro from another part of the plantation came\r\nprivately to tell Harriet that herself and brothers were to be carried\r\noff that night. The poor old mother, who belonged to the same mistress,\r\nwas just going to milk. Harriet wanted to get away without letting her\r\nknow, because she knew that she would raise an uproar and prevent her\r\ngoing, or insist upon going with her, and the time for this was not\r\nyet. But she must give some intimation to those she was going to leave\r\nof her intention, and send such a farewell as she might to the friends\r\nand relations on the plantation. These communications were generally\r\nmade by singing. They sang as they walked along the country roads, and\r\nthe chorus was taken up by others, and the uninitiated knew not the\r\nhidden meaning of the words--\r\n\r\n\r\n     When dat ar ole chariot comes,\r\n      I'm gwine to lebe you;\r\n     I'm boun' for de promised land,\r\n      I'm gwine to lebe you.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese words meant something more than a journey to the Heavenly Canaan.\r\nHarriet said, \"Here, mother, go 'long; I'll do the milkin' to-night and\r\nbring it in.\" The old woman went to her cabin. Harriet took down her\r\nsun-bonnet, and went on to the \"big house,\" where some of her relatives\r\nlived as house servants. She thought she could trust Mary, but there\r\nwere others in the kitchen, and she could say nothing. Mary began to\r\nfrolic with her. She threw her across the kitchen, and ran out, knowing\r\nthat Mary would follow her. But just as they turned the corner of the\r\nhouse, the master to whom Harriet was now hired, came riding up on his\r\nhorse. Mary darted back, and Harriet thought there was no way now but\r\nto sing. But \"the Doctor,\" as the master was called, was regarded with\r\nspecial awe by his slaves; if they were singing or talking together in\r\nthe field, or on the road, and \"the Doctor\" appeared, all was hushed\r\ntill he passed. But Harriet had no time for ceremony; her friends must\r\nhave a warning; and whether the Doctor thought her \"_imperent_\" or not,\r\nshe must sing him farewell. So on she went to meet him, singing:\r\n\r\n\r\n     I'm sorry I'm gwine to lebe you,\r\n      Farewell, oh farewell;\r\n     But I'll meet you in the mornin',\r\n      Farewell, oh farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Doctor passed, and she bowed as she went on, still singing:\r\n\r\n\r\n     I'll meet you in the mornin',\r\n      I'm boun' for de promised land,\r\n     On the oder side of Jordan,\r\n      Boun' for de promised land.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe reached the gate and looked round; the Doctor had stopped his horse,\r\nand had turned around in the saddle, and was looking at her as if there\r\nmight be more in this than \"met the ear.\" Harriet closed the gate, went\r\non a little way, came back, the Doctor still gazing at her. She lifted\r\nup the gate as if she had not latched it properly, waved her hand to\r\nhim, and burst out again:\r\n\r\n\r\n     I'll meet you in the mornin',\r\n      Safe in de promised land,\r\n     On the oder side of Jordan,\r\n      Boun' for de promised land.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd she started on her journey, \"not knowing whither she went,\" except\r\nthat she was going to follow the north star, till it led her to liberty.\r\nCautiously and by night she traveled, cunningly feeling her way, and\r\nfinding out who were friends; till after a long and painful journey she\r\nfound, in answer to careful inquiries, that she had at last crossed that\r\nmagic \"line\" which then separated the land of bondage from the land of\r\nfreedom; for this was before _we_ were commanded by law to take part in\r\nthe iniquity of slavery, and aid in taking and sending back those poor\r\nhunted fugitives who had manhood and intelligence enough to enable them\r\nto make their way thus far towards freedom.\r\n\r\n\"When I found I had crossed dat _line_,\" she said, \"I looked at my hands\r\nto see if I was de same pusson. There was such a glory ober ebery ting;\r\nde sun came like gold through the trees, and ober the fields, and I felt\r\nlike I was in Heaben.\"\r\n\r\nBut then came the bitter drop in the cup of joy. She said she felt like\r\na man who was put in State Prison for twenty-five years. All these\r\ntwenty-five years he was thinking of his home, and longing for the time\r\nwhen he would see it again. At last the day comes--he leaves the prison\r\ngates--he makes his way to his old home, but his old home is not there.\r\nThe house has been pulled down, and a new one has been put up in its\r\nplace; his family and friends are gone nobody knows where; there is no\r\none to take him by the hand, no one to welcome him.\r\n\r\n\"So it was with me,\" she said. \"I had crossed the line. I was _free_;\r\nbut there was no one to welcome me to the land of freedom. I was a\r\nstranger in a strange land; and my home, after all, was down in\r\nMaryland; because my father, my mother, my brothers, and sisters, and\r\nfriends were there. But I was free, and _they_ should be free. I would\r\nmake a home in the North and bring them there, God helping me. Oh, how I\r\nprayed then,\" she said; \"I said to de Lord, 'I'm gwine to hole stiddy on\r\nto _you_, an' I _know_ you'll see me through.'\"\r\n\r\nShe came to Philadelphia, and worked in hotels, in club houses, and\r\nafterwards at Cape May. Whenever she had raised money enough to pay\r\nexpenses, she would make her way back, hide herself, and in various ways\r\ngive notice to those who were ready to strike for freedom. When her\r\nparty was made up, they would start always on Saturday night, because\r\nadvertisements could not be sent out on Sunday, which gave them one day\r\nin advance.\r\n\r\nThen the pursuers would start after them. Advertisements would be posted\r\neverywhere. There was one reward of $12,000 offered for the head of the\r\nwoman who was constantly appearing and enticing away parties of slaves\r\nfrom their master. She had traveled in the cars when these posters were\r\nput up over her head, and she heard them read by those about her--for\r\nshe could not read herself. Fearlessly she went on, trusting in the\r\nLord. She said, \"I started with this idea in my head, 'Dere's _two_\r\nthings I've got a _right_ to, and dese are, Death or Liberty--one or\r\ntother I mean to have. No one will take me back alive; I shall fight for\r\nmy liberty, and when de time has come for me to go, de Lord will let dem\r\nkill me.\" And acting upon this simple creed, and firm in this trusting\r\nfaith, she went back and forth _nineteen times_, according to the\r\nreckoning of her friends. She remembers that she went eleven times from\r\nCanada, but of the other journeys she kept no reckoning.\r\n\r\nWhile Harriet was working as cook in one of the large hotels in\r\nPhiladelphia, the play of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" was being performed for\r\nmany weeks every night. Some of her fellow-servants wanted her to go and\r\nsee it. \"No,\" said Harriet, \"I haint got no heart to go and see the\r\nsufferings of my people played on de stage. I've heard 'Uncle Tom's\r\nCabin' read, and I tell you Mrs. Stowe's pen hasn't begun to paint what\r\nslavery is as I have seen it at the far South. I've seen de _real ting_,\r\nand I don't want to see it on no stage or in no teater.\"\r\n\r\nI will give here an article from a paper published nearly a year ago,\r\nwhich mentions that the price set upon the head of Harriet was much\r\nhigher than I have stated it to be. When asked about this, Harriet said\r\nshe did not know whether it was so, but she heard them read from one\r\npaper that the reward offered was $12,000.\r\n\r\n\"Among American women,\" says the article referred to, \"who has shown a\r\ncourage and self-devotion to the welfare of others, equal to Harriet\r\nTubman? Hear her story of going down again and again into the very jaws\r\nof slavery, to rescue her suffering people, bringing them off through\r\nperils and dangers enough to appall the stoutest heart, till she was\r\nknown among them as 'Moses.'\r\n\r\n\"_Forty thousand dollars_ was not too great a reward for the Maryland\r\nslaveholders to offer for her.\r\n\r\n\"Think of her brave spirit, as strong as Daniel's of old, in its\r\nfearless purpose to serve God, even though the fiery furnace should be\r\nher portion. I have looked into her dark face, and wondered and admired\r\nas I listened to the thrilling deeds her lion heart had prompted her to\r\ndare. 'I have heard their groans and sighs, and seen their tears, and I\r\nwould give every drop of blood in my veins to free them,' she said.\r\n\r\n\"The other day, at Gerrit Smith's, I saw this heroic woman, whom the pen\r\nof genius will yet make famous, as one of the noblest Christian hearts\r\never inspired to lift the burdens of the wronged and oppressed, and what\r\ndo you think she said to me? She had been tending and caring for our\r\nUnion black (and white) soldiers in hospital during the war, and at the\r\nend of her labors was on her way home, coming in a car through New\r\nJersey. A white man, the conductor, thrust her out of the car with such\r\nviolence that she has not been able to work scarcely any since; and as\r\nshe told me of the pain she had and still suffered, she said she did not\r\nknow what she should have done for herself, and the old father and\r\nmother she takes care of, if Mr. Wendell Phillips had not sent her $60,\r\nthat kept them warm through the winter. She had a letter from W. H.\r\nSeward to Maj.-Gen. Hunter, in which he says, 'I have known her long,\r\nand a nobler, higher spirit, or truer, seldom dwells in the human\r\nform.'\"\r\n\r\nIt will be impossible to give any connected account of the different\r\njourneys taken by Harriet for the rescue of her people, as she herself\r\nhas no idea of the dates connected with them, or of the order in which\r\nthey were made. She thinks she was about 25 when she made her own\r\nescape, and this was in the last year of James K. Polk's administration.\r\nFrom that time till the beginning of the war, her years were spent in\r\nthese journeyings back and forth, with intervals between, in which she\r\nworked only to spend the avails of her labor in providing for the wants\r\nof her next party of fugitives. By night she traveled, many times on\r\nfoot, over mountains, through forests, across rivers, mid perils by\r\nland, perils by water, perils from enemies, \"perils among false\r\nbrethren.\" Sometimes members of her party would become exhausted,\r\nfoot-sore, and bleeding, and declare they could not go on, they must\r\nstay where they dropped down, and die; others would think a voluntary\r\nreturn to slavery better than being overtaken and carried back, and\r\nwould insist upon returning; then there was no remedy but force; the\r\nrevolver carried by this bold and daring pioneer would be pointed at\r\ntheir heads. \"Dead niggers tell no tales,\" said Harriet; \"Go on or die;\"\r\nand so she compelled them to drag their weary limbs on their northward\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nAt one time she collected and sent on a gang of thirty-nine fugitives in\r\nthe care of others, as from some cause she was prevented from\r\naccompanying them. Sometimes, when she and her party were concealed in\r\nthe woods, they saw their pursuers pass, on their horses, down the high\r\nroad, tacking up the advertisements for them on the fences and trees.\r\n\r\n\"And den how we laughed,\" said she. \"_We_ was de fools, and _dey_ was de\r\nwise men; but we wasn't fools enough to go down de high road in de broad\r\ndaylight.\" At one time she left her party in the woods, and went by a\r\nlong and roundabout way to one of the \"stations of the Underground\r\nRailway,\" as she called them. Here she procured food for her famished\r\nparty, often paying out of her hardly-gained earnings, five dollars a\r\nday for food for them. But she dared not go back to them till night, for\r\nfear of being watched, and thus revealing their hiding-place. After\r\nnightfall, the sound of a hymn sung at a distance comes upon the ears\r\nof the concealed and famished fugitives in the woods, and they know that\r\ntheir deliverer is at hand. They listen eagerly for the words she sings,\r\nfor by them they are to be warned of danger, or informed of safety.\r\nNearer and nearer comes the unseen singer, and the words are wafted to\r\ntheir ears:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Hail, oh hail ye happy spirits,\r\n      Death no more shall make you fear,\r\n     No grief nor sorrow, pain nor anger (anguish)\r\n      Shall no more distress you there.\r\n\r\n     Around him are ten thousan' angels,\r\n      Always ready to 'bey comman'.\r\n     Dey are always hobring round you,\r\n      Till you reach the hebbenly lan'.\r\n\r\n     Jesus, Jesus will go wid you;\r\n      He will lead you to his throne;\r\n     He who died has gone before you,\r\n      Trod de wine-press all alone.\r\n\r\n     He whose thunders shake creation;\r\n      He who bids the planets roll;\r\n     He who rides upon the temple, (tempest)\r\n      An' his scepter sways de whole.\r\n\r\n     Dark and thorny is de desert,\r\n      Through de pilgrim makes his ways,\r\n     Yet beyon' dis vale of sorrow,\r\n      Lies de fiel's of endless days.\r\n\r\n\r\nI give these words exactly as Harriet sang them to me to a sweet and\r\nsimple Methodist air. \"De first time I go by singing dis hymn, dey don't\r\ncome out to me,\" she said, \"till I listen if de coast is clar; den when\r\nI go back and sing it again, dey come out. But if I sing:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Moses go down in Egypt,\r\n      Till ole Pharo' let me go;\r\n     Hadn't been for Adam's fall,\r\n      Shouldn't hab to died at all,\r\n\r\n\r\nden dey don't come out, for dere's danger in de way.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so by night travel, by hiding, by signals, by threatening, she\r\nbrought the people safely to the land of liberty. But after the passage\r\nof the Fugitive Slave law, she said, \"I wouldn't trust Uncle Sam wid my\r\npeople no longer; I brought 'em all clar off to Canada.\"\r\n\r\nOf the very many interesting stories told me by Harriet, I cannot\r\nrefrain from telling to my readers that of _Joe_, who accompanied her\r\nupon her seventh or eighth journey from Maryland to Canada.\r\n\r\nJoe was a noble specimen of a negro, and was hired out by his master to\r\na man for whom he worked faithfully for six years, saving him the\r\nexpense of an overseer, and taking all trouble off his hands. At length\r\nthis man found him so absolutely necessary to him, that he determined to\r\nbuy him at any cost. His master held him proportionably high. However,\r\nby paying a thousand dollars down for him, and promising to pay another\r\nthousand in a certain time, Joe passed into the hands of his new\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nAs may be imagined, Joe was somewhat surprised when the first order\r\nissued from his master's lips, was, \"Now, Joe, strip and take a\r\nwhipping!\" Joe's experience of _whippings_, as he had seen them\r\ninflicted upon others, was not such as to cause him particularly to\r\ndesire to go through the same operation on his own account; and he,\r\nnaturally enough, demurred, and at first thought of resisting. But he\r\ncalled to mind a scene which he had witnessed a few days before, in the\r\nfield, the particulars of which are too horrible and too harassing to\r\nthe feelings to be given to my readers, and he thought it best to\r\nsubmit; but first he tried remonstrance.\r\n\r\n\"Mas'r,\" said he, \"habn't I always been faithful to you? Habn't I worked\r\nthrough sun an' rain, early in de mornin', and late at night; habn't I\r\nsaved you an oberseer by doin' his work; hab you anyting to complain of\r\nagin me?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Joe; I've no complaint to make of you; you're a good nigger, and\r\nyou've always worked well; but the first lesson my niggers have to learn\r\nis that I am _master_, and that they are not to resist or refuse to obey\r\nanything I tell 'em to do. So the first thing they've got to do, is to\r\nbe whipped; if they resist, they get it all the harder; and so I'll go\r\non, till I kill 'em, but they've got to give up at last, and learn that\r\nI'm master.\"\r\n\r\nJoe thought it best to submit. He stripped off his upper clothing, and\r\ntook his whipping without a word; but as he drew his clothes up over his\r\ntorn and bleeding back, he said, \"Dis is de last!\" That night he took a\r\nboat and went a long distance to the cabin of Harriet's father, and\r\nsaid, \"Next time Moses comes, let me know.\" It was only a week or two\r\nafter that, that the mysterious woman whom no one could lay their finger\r\non appeared, and men, women, and children began to disappear from the\r\nplantations. One fine morning Joe was missing, and his brother William,\r\nfrom another plantation; Peter and Eliza, too, were gone; and these made\r\npart of Harriet's next party, who began their pilgrimage from Maryland\r\nto Canada, or as they expressed it, from \"Egypt to de land of Canaan.\"\r\n\r\nTheir adventures were enough to fill a volume; they were pursued; they\r\nwere hidden in \"potato holes,\" while their pursuers passed within a few\r\nfeet of them; they were passed along by friends in various disguises;\r\nthey scattered and separated, to be led by guides by a roundabout way,\r\nto a meeting-place again. They were taken in by Sam Green, the man who\r\nwas afterwards sent to State Prison for ten years for having a copy of\r\n\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" in his house; and so, hunted and hiding and\r\nwandering, they came at last to the long bridge at the entrance of the\r\ncity of Wilmington, Delaware. The rewards posted up everywhere had been\r\nat first five hundred dollars for Joe, if taken within the limits of the\r\nUnited States; then a thousand, and then fifteen hundred dollars, \"an'\r\nall expenses clar an' clean, for his body in Easton Jail.\" Eight hundred\r\nfor William, and four hundred for Peter, and twelve thousand for the\r\nwoman who enticed them away. The long Wilmington Bridge was guarded by\r\npolice officers, and the advertisements were everywhere. The party were\r\nscattered, and taken to the houses of different colored friends, and\r\nword was sent secretly to Thomas Garrett, of Wilmington, of their\r\ncondition, and the necessity of their being taken across the bridge.\r\nThomas Garrett is a Quaker, and a man of a wonderfully large and\r\ngenerous heart, through whose hands, Harriet tells me, two thousand\r\nself-emancipated slaves passed on their way to freedom. He was always\r\nready, heart and hand and means, in aiding these poor fugitives, and\r\nrendered most efficient help to Harriet on many of her journeys back and\r\nforth. A letter received a few days since by the writer, from this\r\nnoble-hearted philanthropist, will be given presently.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Thomas Garrett heard of the condition of these poor people,\r\nhis plan was formed. He engaged two wagons, filled them with\r\nbricklayers, whom of course he paid well for their share in the\r\nenterprise, and sent them across the bridge. They went as if on a\r\nfrolic, singing and shouting. The guards saw them pass, and of course\r\nexpected them to re-cross the bridge. After nightfall (and fortunately\r\nit was a dark night) the same wagons went back, but with an addition to\r\ntheir party. The fugitives were on the bottom of the wagons, the\r\nbricklayers on the seats, still singing and shouting; and so they passed\r\nby the guards, who were entirely unsuspicious of the nature of the load\r\nthe wagons contained, or of the amount of property thus escaping their\r\nhands. And so they made their way to New York. When they entered the\r\nanti-slavery office there, Joe was recognized at once by the description\r\nin the advertisement. \"Well,\" said Mr. Oliver Johnson, \"I am glad to\r\nsee the man whose head is worth fifteen hundred dollars.\" At this Joe's\r\nheart sank. If the advertisement had got to New York, that place which\r\nit had taken them so many days and nights to reach, he thought he was in\r\ndanger still. \"And how far is it now to Canada?\" he asked. When told how\r\nmany miles, for they were to come through New York State, and cross the\r\nSuspension Bridge, he was ready to give up. \"From dat time Joe was\r\nsilent,\" said Harriet; \"he sang no more, he talked no more; he sat wid\r\nhis head on his hand, and nobody could 'muse him or make him take any\r\ninterest in anyting.\" They passed along in safety, and at length found\r\nthemselves in the cars, approaching Suspension Bridge. The rest were\r\nvery joyous and happy, but Joe sat silent and sad. Their\r\nfellow-passengers all seemed interested in and for them, and listened\r\nwith tears, as Harriet and all their party lifted up their voices and\r\nsang:\r\n\r\n\r\n           I'm on my way to Canada,\r\n            That cold and dreary land;\r\n           The sad effects of slavery,\r\n            I can't no longer stand.\r\n           I've served my master all my days,\r\n            Widout a dime's reward;\r\n           And now I'm forced to run away,\r\n            To flee the lash abroad.\r\n     Farewell, ole master, don't think hard of me,\r\n     I'll travel on to Canada, where all the slaves are free.\r\n\r\n           The hounds are baying on my track,\r\n            Ole master comes behind,\r\n           Resolved that he will bring me back,\r\n            Before I cross de line;\r\n           I'm now embarked for yonder shore,\r\n            There a man's a man by law;\r\n           The iron horse will bear me o'er,\r\n            To shake de lion's paw.\r\n     Oh, righteous Father, wilt thou not pity me,\r\n     And aid me on to Canada where all the slaves are free.\r\n\r\n           Oh, I heard Queen Victoria say,\r\n            That if we would forsake\r\n           Our native land of slavery,\r\n            And come across the lake;\r\n           That she was standin' on de shore,\r\n            Wid arms extended wide,\r\n           To give us all a peaceful home\r\n            Beyond de rolling tide.\r\n       Farewell, ole master, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cars began to cross the bridge. Harriet was very anxious to have her\r\ncompanions see the Falls. William, Peter, and Eliza came eagerly to look\r\nat the wonderful sight; but Joe sat still, with his head upon his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Joe, come look at de Falls! Joe, you fool you, come see de Falls! its\r\nyour last chance.\" But Joe sat still and never raised his head. At\r\nlength Harriet knew by the rise in the center of the bridge, and the\r\ndescent on the other side, that they had crossed \"the line.\" She sprang\r\nacross to Joe's seat, shook him with all her might, and shouted, \"Joe,\r\nyou've shook de lion's paw!\" Joe did not know what she meant. \"Joe,\r\nyou're _free_!\" shouted Harriet. Then Joe's head went up, he raised his\r\nhands on high, and his face, streaming with tears, to heaven, and broke\r\nout in loud and thrilling tones:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Glory to God and Jesus too,\r\n      One more soul is safe!\r\n     Oh, go and carry de news,\r\n      One more soul got safe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Joe, come and look at de Falls!\" called Harriet.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Glory to God and Jesus too,\r\n      One more soul got safe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nwas all the answer. The cars stopped on the other side. Joe's feet were\r\nthe first to touch British soil, after those of the conductor.\r\n\r\nLoud roared the waters of Niagara, but louder still ascended the anthem\r\nof praise from the overflowing heart of the freeman. And can we doubt\r\nthat the strain was taken up by angel voices, and that through the\r\narches of Heaven echoed and re-echoed the strain:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Glory to God in the Highest,\r\n     Glory to God and Jesus too,\r\n      One more soul is safe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The ladies and gentlemen gathered round him,\" said Harriet, \"till I\r\ncouldn't see Joe for the crowd, only I heard 'Glory to God and Jesus\r\ntoo!' louder than ever.\" William went after him, and pulled him,\r\nsaying, \"Joe, stop your noise! you act like a fool!' Then Peter ran in\r\nand jerked him mos' off his feet,--\"Joe, stop your hollerin'! Folks'll\r\nthink you're crazy!\" But Joe gave no heed. The ladies were crying, and\r\nthe tears like rain ran down Joe's sable cheeks. A lady reached over her\r\nfine cambric handkerchief to him. Joe wiped his face, and then he spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! if I'd felt like dis down South, it would hab taken _nine_ men to\r\ntake me; only one more journey for me now, and dat is to Hebben!\" \"Well,\r\nyou ole fool you,\" said Harriet, with whom there seems but one step from\r\nthe sublime to the ridiculous, \"you might a' looked at the Falls fust,\r\nand den gone to Hebben afterwards.\" She has seen Joe several times\r\nsince, a happy and industrious freeman in Canada.\r\n\r\nWhen asked, as she often is, how it was possible that she was not afraid\r\nto go back, with that tremendous price upon her head, Harriet always\r\nanswers, \"Why, don't I tell you, Missus, t'wan't _me_, 'twas _de Lord_!\r\nI always _tole_ him, 'I trust to you. I don't know where to go or what\r\nto do, but I expect you to lead me,' an' he always did.\" At one time she\r\nwas going down, watched for everywhere, after there had been a meeting\r\nof slaveholders in the court-house of one of the large cities of\r\nMaryland, and an added reward had been put upon her head, with various\r\nthreats of the different cruel devices by which she should be tortured\r\nand put to death; friends gathered round her, imploring her not to go on\r\ndirectly in the face of danger and death, and this was Harriet's answer\r\nto them:\r\n\r\n\"Now look yer! John saw the city, didn't he? Yes, John saw the city.\r\nWell, what did he see? He saw twelve gates--three of dose gates was on\r\nde north--three of 'em was on the east--and three of 'em was on de\r\nwest--but dere was three of 'em on de _South_ too; an' I reckon if dey\r\nkill me down dere, I'll git into one of dem gates, don't you?\"\r\n\r\nWhether Harriet's ideas of the geographical bearings of the gates of the\r\nCelestial City, as seen in the Apocalyptic vision, were correct or not,\r\nwe cannot doubt that she was right in the deduction her faith drew from\r\nthem; and that _somewhere_, whether north, south, east, or west, to our\r\ndim vision, there is a gate to be opened for Harriet, where the welcome\r\nwill be given, \"Come in thou blessed of my Father.\"\r\n\r\nMany of the stories told me by Harriet, in answer to questions, have\r\nbeen corroborated by letters, some of which will appear in this book.\r\nOf others, I have not been able to procure confirmation, owing to\r\nignorance of the address of those conversant with the facts. I find\r\namong her papers, many of which are defaced by being carried about with\r\nher for years, portions of letters addressed to myself, by persons at\r\nthe South, and speaking of the valuable assistance Harriet was rendering\r\nour soldiers in the hospital, and our armies in the field. At this time\r\nher manner of life, as related by herself, was this:\r\n\r\n\"Well, Missus, I'd go to de hospital, I would, early eb'ry mornin'. I'd\r\nget a big chunk of ice, I would, and put it in a basin, and fill it with\r\nwater; den I'd take a sponge and begin. Fust man I'd come to, I'd thrash\r\naway de flies, an' dey'd rise, dey would, like bees roun' a hive. Den\r\nI'd begin to bathe der wounds, an' by de time I'd bathed off three or\r\nfour, de fire and heat would have melted de ice and made de water warm,\r\nan' it would be as red as clar blood. Den I'd go an' git more ice, I\r\nwould, an' by de time I got to de nex' ones, de flies would be roun' de\r\nfust ones black an' thick as eber.\" In this way she worked, day after\r\nday, till late at night; then she went home to her little cabin, and\r\nmade about fifty pies, a great quantity of ginger-bread, and two casks\r\nof root beer. These she would hire some contraband to sell for her\r\nthrough the camps, and thus she would provide her support for another\r\nday; for this woman never received pay or pension, and never drew for\r\nherself but twenty days' rations during the four years of her labors. At\r\none time she was called away from Hilton Head, by one of our officers,\r\nto come to Fernandina, where the men were \"dying off like sheep,\" from\r\ndysentery. Harriet had acquired quite a reputation for her skill in\r\ncuring this disease, by a medicine which she prepared from roots which\r\ngrew near the waters which gave the disease. Here she found thousands of\r\nsick soldiers and contrabands, and immediately gave up her time and\r\nattention to them. At another time, we find her nursing those who were\r\ndown by hundreds with small-pox and malignant fevers. She had never had\r\nthese diseases, but she seems to have no more fear of death in one form\r\nthan another. \"De Lord would take keer of her till her time came, an'\r\nden she was ready to go.\"\r\n\r\nWhen our armies and gun-boats first appeared in any part of the South,\r\nmany of the poor negroes were as much afraid of \"de Yankee Buckra\" as\r\nof their own masters. It was almost impossible to win their confidence,\r\nor to get information from them. But to Harriet they would tell\r\nanything; and so it became quite important that she should accompany\r\nexpeditions going up the rivers, or into unexplored parts of the\r\ncountry, to control and get information from those whom they took with\r\nthem as guides.\r\n\r\nGen. Hunter asked her at one time if she would go with several gun-boats\r\nup the Combahee River, the object of the expedition being to take up the\r\ntorpedoes placed by the rebels in the river, to destroy railroads and\r\nbridges, and to cut off supplies from the rebel troops. She said she\r\nwould go if Col. Montgomery was to be appointed commander of the\r\nexpedition. Col. Montgomery was one of John Brown's men, and was well\r\nknown to Harriet. Accordingly, Col. Montgomery was appointed to the\r\ncommand, and Harriet, with several men under her, the principal of whom\r\nwas J. Plowden, whose pass I have, accompanied the expedition. Harriet\r\ndescribes in the most graphic manner the appearance of the plantations\r\nas they passed up the river; the frightened negroes leaving their work\r\nand taking to the woods, at sight of the gun-boats; then coming to peer\r\nout like startled deer, and scudding away like the wind at the sound of\r\nthe steam-whistle. \"Well,\" said one old negro, \"Mas'r said de Yankees\r\nhad horns and tails, but I nebber beliebed it till now.\" But the word\r\nwas passed along by the mysterious telegraphic communication existing\r\namong these simple people, that these were \"Lincoln's gun-boats come to\r\nset them free.\" In vain, then, the drivers used their whips, in their\r\nefforts to hurry the poor creatures back to their quarters; they all\r\nturned and ran for the gun-boats. They came down every road, across\r\nevery field, just as they had left their work and their cabins; women\r\nwith children clinging around their necks, hanging to their dresses,\r\nrunning behind, all making at full speed for \"Lincoln's gun-boats.\"\r\nEight hundred poor wretches at one time crowded the banks, with their\r\nhands extended towards their deliverers, and they were all taken off\r\nupon the gun-boats, and carried down to Beaufort.\r\n\r\n\"I nebber see such a sight,\" said Harriet; \"we laughed, an' laughed, an'\r\nlaughed. Here you'd see a woman wid a pail on her head, rice a smokin'\r\nin it jus as she'd taken it from de fire, young one hangin' on behind,\r\none han' roun' her forehead to hold on, 'tother han' diggin' into de\r\nrice-pot, eatin' wid all its might; hold of her dress two or three more;\r\ndown her back a bag wid a pig in it. One woman brought two pigs, a\r\nwhite one, an' a black one; we took 'em all on board; named de white pig\r\nBeauregard, an' de black pig Jeff Davis. Sometimes de women would come\r\nwid twins hangin' roun' der necks; 'pears like I nebber see so many\r\ntwins in my life; bags on der shoulders, baskets on der heads, and young\r\nones taggin' behin', all loaded; pigs squealin', chickens screamin',\r\nyoung ones squallin'.\" And so they came pouring down to the gun-boats.\r\nWhen they stood on the shore, and the small boats put out to take them\r\noff, they all wanted to get in at once. After the boats were crowded,\r\nthey would hold on to them so that they could not leave the shore. The\r\noarsmen would beat them on their hands, but they would not let go; they\r\nwere afraid the gun-boats would go off and leave them, and all wanted to\r\nmake sure of one of these arks of refuge. At length Col. Montgomery\r\nshouted from the upper deck, above the clamor of appealing tones,\r\n\"Moses, you'll have to give 'em a song.\" Then Harriet lifted up her\r\nvoice and sang:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Of all the whole creation in the east or in the west,\r\n     The glorious Yankee nation is the greatest and the best,\r\n     Come along! Come along! don't be alarmed,\r\n     Uncle Sam is rich enough to give you all a farm.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of every verse, the negroes in their enthusiasm would throw\r\nup their hands and shout \"Glory,\" and the row-boats would take that\r\nopportunity to push off; and so at last they were all brought on board.\r\nThe masters fled; houses and barns and railroad bridges were burned,\r\ntracks torn up, torpedoes destroyed, and the expedition was in all\r\nrespects successful.\r\n\r\nThis fearless woman was often sent into the rebel lines as a spy, and\r\nbrought back valuable information as to the position of armies and\r\nbatteries; she has been in battle when the shot was falling like hail,\r\nand the bodies of dead and wounded men were dropping around her like\r\nleaves in autumn; but the thought of fear never seems to have had place\r\nfor a moment in her mind. She had her duty to perform, and she expected\r\nto be taken care of till it was done.\r\n\r\nWould that instead of taking them in this poor way at second-hand, my\r\nreaders could hear this woman's graphic accounts of scenes she herself\r\nwitnessed, could listen to her imitations of negro preachers in their\r\nown very peculiar dialect, her singing of camp-meeting hymns, her\r\naccount of \"experience meetings,\" her imitations of the dances, and the\r\nfuneral ceremonies of these simple people. \"Why, der language down dar\r\nin de far South is jus' as different from ours in Maryland, as you can\r\nthink,\" said she. \"Dey laughed when dey heard me talk, an' I could not\r\nunderstand dem, no how.\" She described a midnight funeral which she\r\nattended; for the slaves, never having been allowed to bury their dead\r\nin the day time, continued the custom of night funerals from habit.\r\n\r\nThe corpse was laid upon the ground, and the people all sat round, the\r\ngroup being lighted up by pine torches.\r\n\r\nThe old negro preacher began by giving out a hymn, which was sung by\r\nall. \"An' oh! I wish you could hear 'em sing, Missus,\" said Harriet.\r\n\"Der voices is so sweet, and dey can sing eberyting we sing, an' den dey\r\ncan sing a great many hymns dat we can't nebber catch at all.\"\r\n\r\nThe old preacher began his sermon by pointing to the dead man, who lay\r\nin a rude box on the ground before him.\r\n\r\n\"_Shum?_ Ded-a-de-dah! _Shum, David?_ Ded-a-de-dah! Now I want you all\r\nto _flec'_ for moment. Who ob all dis congregation is gwine next to lie\r\nded-a-de-dah? You can't go nowheres, my frien's and bredren, but Deff'll\r\nfin' you. You can't dig no hole so deep an' bury yourself dar, but God\r\nA'mighty's far-seein' eye'll fine you, an' Deff'll come arter you. You\r\ncan't go into that big fort (pointing to Hilton Head), an' shut\r\nyourself up dar; dat fort dat Sesh Buckner said de debil couldn't take,\r\nbut Deff'll fin' you dar. All your frien's may forget you, but Deff'll\r\nnebber forget you. Now, my bredren, prepare to lie ded-a-de-dah!\"\r\n\r\nThis was the burden of a very long sermon, after which the whole\r\ncongregation went round in a sort of solemn dance, called the \"spiritual\r\nshuffle,\" shaking hands with each other, and calling each other by name\r\nas they sang:\r\n\r\n\r\n     My sis'r Mary's boun' to go;\r\n     My sis'r Nanny's boun' to go;\r\n     My brudder Tony's boun' to go;\r\n     My brudder July's boun' to go.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis to the same tune, till every hand had been shaken by every one of\r\nthe company. When they came to Harriet, who was a stranger, they sang:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Eberybody's boun' to go!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe body was then placed in a Government wagon, and by the light of the\r\npine torches, the strange, dark procession moved along, singing a rude\r\nfuneral hymn, till they reached the place of burial.\r\n\r\nHarriet's account of her interview with an old negro she met at Hilton\r\nHead, is amusing and interesting. He said, \"I'd been yere seventy-three\r\nyears, workin' for my master widout even a dime wages. I'd worked\r\nrain-wet sun dry. I'd worked wid my mouf full of dust, but would not\r\nstop to get a drink of water. I'd been whipped, an' starved, an' I was\r\nalways prayin', 'Oh! Lord, come an' delibber us!' All dat time de birds\r\nhad been flyin', an' de rabens had been cryin', and de fish had been\r\nsunnin' in de waters. One day I look up, an' I see a big cloud; it\r\ndidn't come up like as de clouds come out far yonder, but it 'peared to\r\nbe right ober head. Der was tunders out of dat, an' der was lightnin's.\r\nDen I looked down on de water, an' I see, 'peared to me a big house in\r\nde water, an' out of de big house came great big eggs, and de good eggs\r\nwent on trou' de air, an' fell into de fort; an' de bad eggs burst\r\nbefore dey got dar. Den de Sesh Buckra begin to run, an de neber stop\r\nrunning till de git to de swamp, an' de stick dar an' de die dar. Den I\r\nheard 'twas the Yankee ship[1] firin' out de big eggs, an dey had come\r\nto set us free. Den I praise de Lord. He come an' put he little finger\r\nin de work, an' dey Sesh Buckra all go; and de birds stop flyin', and de\r\nrabens stop cryin', an' when I go to catch a fish to eat wid my rice,\r\nde's no fish dar. De Lord A'mighty'd come and frightened 'em all out of\r\nde waters. Oh! Praise de Lord! I'd prayed seventy-three years, an' now\r\nhe's come an' we's all free.\"\r\n\r\nThe last time Harriet was returning from the war, with her pass as\r\nhospital nurse, she bought a half-fare ticket, as she was told she must\r\ndo; and missing the other train, she got into an emigrant train on the\r\nAmboy Railroad. When the conductor looked at her ticket, he said, \"Come,\r\nhustle out of here! We don't carry niggers for half-fare.\" Harriet\r\nexplained to him that she was in the employ of Government, and was\r\nentitled to transportation as the soldiers were. But the conductor took\r\nher forcibly by the arm, and said, \"I'll make you tired of trying to\r\nstay here.\" She resisted, and being very strong, she could probably have\r\ngot the better of the conductor, had he not called three men to his\r\nassistance. The car was filled with emigrants, and no one seemed to take\r\nher part. The only words she heard, accompanied with fearful oaths,\r\nwere, \"Pitch the nagur out!\" They nearly wrenched her arm off, and at\r\nlength threw her, with all their strength, into a baggage-car. She\r\nsupposed her arm was broken, and in intense suffering she came on to New\r\nYork. As she left the car, a delicate-looking young man came up to her,\r\nand, handing her a card, said, \"You ought to sue that conductor, and if\r\nyou want a witness, call on me.\" Harriet remained all winter under the\r\ncare of a physician in New York; he advised her to sue the Railroad\r\ncompany, and said that he would willingly testify as to her injuries.\r\nBut the card the young man had given her was only a visiting card, and\r\nshe did not know where to find him, and so she let the matter go.\r\n\r\nThe writer here finds it necessary to apologize for the very desultory\r\nand hasty manner in which this little book is written. Being herself\r\npressed for time, in the expectation of soon leaving the country, she is\r\nobliged to pen down the material to be used in the short and interrupted\r\ninterviews she can obtain with Harriet, and also to use such letters and\r\naccounts as may be sent her, as they come, without being able to work\r\nthem in, in the order of time. A very material assistance is to be\r\nrendered her by the kind offer of an account of Harriet's services\r\nduring the war, written by Mr. Charles P. Wood, of Auburn, and kindly\r\ncopied by one of Harriet's most faithful and most efficient friends,\r\nMrs. S. M. Hopkins, of that place.\r\n\r\nIt was a wise plan of our sagacious heroine to leave her old parents\r\ntill the last to be brought away. They were pensioned off as too old to\r\nwork, had a cabin, and a horse and cow, and were quite comfortable. If\r\nHarriet had taken them away before the young people, these last would\r\nhave been sold into Southern slavery, to keep them out of her way. But\r\nat length Harriet heard that the old man had been betrayed by a slave\r\nwhom he had assisted, but who had turned back, and when questioned by\r\nhis wife, told her the story of his intended escape, and of the aid he\r\nhad received from \"Old Ben.\" This woman, hoping to curry favor with her\r\nmaster, revealed the whole to him, and \"Old Ben\" was arrested. He was to\r\nbe tried the next week, when Harriet appeared upon the scene, and, as\r\nshe says, \"saved dem de expense ob de trial,\" and removed her father to\r\na higher court, by taking him off to Canada. The manner of their escape\r\nis detailed in the following letter from Thomas Garrett, the Wilmington\r\nQuaker:\r\n\r\n\r\n     WILMINGTON, 6th Mo., 1868.\r\n\r\n     MY FRIEND: Thy favor of the 12th reached me yesterday, requesting\r\n     such reminiscences as I could give respecting the remarkable labors\r\n     of Harriet Tubman, in aiding her colored friends from bondage. I\r\n     may begin by saying, living as I have in a slave State, and the\r\n     laws being very severe where any proof could be made of any one\r\n     aiding slaves on their way to freedom, I have not felt at liberty\r\n     to keep any written word of Harriet's or my own labors, except in\r\n     numbering those whom I have aided. For that reason I cannot furnish\r\n     so interesting an account of Harriet's labors as I otherwise could,\r\n     and now would be glad to do; for in truth I never met with any\r\n     person, of any color, who had more confidence in the voice of God,\r\n     as spoken direct to her soul. She has frequently told me that she\r\n     talked with God, and he talked with her every day of her life, and\r\n     she has declared to me that she felt no more fear of being arrested\r\n     by her former master, or any other person, when in his immediate\r\n     neighborhood, than she did in the State of New York, or Canada, for\r\n     she said she never ventured only where God sent her, and her faith\r\n     in a Supreme Power truly was great.\r\n\r\n     I have now been confined to my room with indisposition more than\r\n     four weeks, and cannot sit to write much; but I feel so much\r\n     interested in Harriet that I will try to give some of the most\r\n     remarkable incidents that now present themselves to my mind. The\r\n     date of the commencement of her labors, I cannot certainly give;\r\n     but I think it must have been about 1845; from that time till 1860,\r\n     I think she must have brought from the neighborhood where she had\r\n     been held as a slave, from 60 to 80 persons, from Maryland, some 80\r\n     miles from here. No slave who placed himself under her care, was\r\n     ever arrested that I have heard of; she mostly had her regular\r\n     stopping places on her route; but in one instance, when she had two\r\n     stout men with her, some 30 miles below here, she said that God\r\n     told her to stop, which she did; and then asked him what she must\r\n     do. He told her to leave the road, and turn to the left; she\r\n     obeyed, and soon came to a small stream of tide water; there was no\r\n     boat, no bridge; she again inquired of her Guide what she was to\r\n     do. She was told to go through. It was cold, in the month of March;\r\n     but having confidence in her Guide, she went in; the water came up\r\n     to her arm-pits; the men refused to follow till they saw her safe\r\n     on the opposite shore. They then followed, and if I mistake not,\r\n     she had soon to wade a second stream; soon after which she came to\r\n     a cabin of colored people, who took them all in, put them to bed,\r\n     and dried their clothes, ready to proceed next night on their\r\n     journey. Harriet had run out of money, and gave them some of her\r\n     under-clothing to pay for their kindness. When she called on me two\r\n     days after, she was so hoarse she could hardly speak, and was also\r\n     suffering with violent toothache. The strange part of the story we\r\n     found to be, that the master of these two men had put up the\r\n     previous day, at the railroad station near where she left, an\r\n     advertisement for them, offering a large reward for their\r\n     apprehension; but they made a safe exit. She at one time brought as\r\n     many as seven or eight, several of whom were women and children.\r\n     She was well known here in Chester County and Philadelphia, and\r\n     respected by all true abolitionists. I had been in the habit of\r\n     furnishing her and those that accompanied her, as she returned from\r\n     her acts of mercy, with new shoes; and on one occasion when I had\r\n     not seen her for three months, she came into my store. I said,\r\n     \"Harriet, I am glad to see thee! I suppose thee wants a pair of new\r\n     shoes.\" Her reply was \"I want more than that.\" I, in jest, said, \"I\r\n     have always been liberal with thee, and wish to be; but I am not\r\n     rich, and cannot afford to give much.\" Her reply was: \"God tells me\r\n     you have money for me.\" I asked her \"if God never deceived her?\"\r\n     She said, \"No!\" \"Well! how much does thee want?\" After studying a\r\n     moment, she said: \"About twenty-three dollars.\" I then gave her\r\n     twenty-four dollars and some odd cents, the net proceeds of five\r\n     pounds sterling, received through Eliza Wigham, of Scotland, for\r\n     her. I had given some accounts of Harriet's labor to the\r\n     Anti-Slavery Society of Edinburgh, of which Eliza Wigham was\r\n     Secretary. On the reading of my letter, a gentleman present said he\r\n     would send Harriet four pounds if he knew of any way to get it to\r\n     her. Eliza Wigham offered to forward it to me for her, and that was\r\n     the first money ever received by me for her. Some twelve months\r\n     after, she called on me again, and said that God told her I had\r\n     some money for her, but not so much as before. I had, a few days\r\n     previous, received the net proceeds of one pound ten shillings from\r\n     Europe for her. To say the least, there was something remarkable in\r\n     these facts, whether clairvoyance, or the divine impression on her\r\n     mind from the source of all power, I cannot tell; but certain it\r\n     was she had a guide within herself other than the written word, for\r\n     she never had any education. She brought away her aged parents in a\r\n     singular manner. They started with an old horse, fitted out in\r\n     primitive style with a _straw collar_, a pair of old chaise wheels,\r\n     with a board on the axle to sit on, another board swung with ropes,\r\n     fastened to the axle, to rest their feet on. She got her parents,\r\n     who were both slaves belonging to different masters, on this rude\r\n     vehicle to the railroad, put them in the cars, turned Jehu herself,\r\n     and drove to town in a style that no human being ever did before or\r\n     since; but she was happy at having arrived safe. Next day, I\r\n     furnished her with money to take them all to Canada. I afterwards\r\n     sold their horse, and sent them the balance of the proceeds. I\r\n     believe that Harriet succeeded in freeing all her relatives but one\r\n     sister and her three children. Etc., etc.\r\n\r\n     Thy friend,\r\n\r\n     THOS. GARRETT.\r\n\r\n\r\nFriend Garrett probably refers here to those who passed through his\r\nhands. Harriet was obliged to come by many different routes on her\r\ndifferent journeys, and though she never counted those whom she brought\r\naway with her, it would seem, by the computation of others, that there\r\nmust have been somewhere near three hundred brought by her to the\r\nNorthern States and Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Extracts from a letter written by Mr. Sanborn, Secretary of the\r\n     Massachusetts Board of State Charities.\r\n\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR MADAME: Mr. Phillips has sent me your note, asking for\r\n     reminiscences of Harriet Tubman, and testimonials to her\r\n     extraordinary story, which all her New England friends will, I am\r\n     sure, be glad to furnish.\r\n\r\n     I never had reason to doubt the truth of what Harriet said in\r\n     regard to her own career, for I found her singularly truthful. Her\r\n     imagination is warm and rich, and there is a whole region of the\r\n     marvelous in her nature, which has manifested itself at times\r\n     remarkably. Her dreams and visions, misgivings and forewarnings,\r\n     ought not to be omitted in any life of her, particularly those\r\n     relating to John Brown.\r\n\r\n     She was in his confidence in 1858-9, and he had a great regard for\r\n     her, which he often expressed to me. She aided him in his plans,\r\n     and expected to do so still further, when his career was closed by\r\n     that wonderful campaign in Virginia. The first time she came to my\r\n     house, in Concord, after that tragedy, she was shown into a room in\r\n     the evening, where Brackett's bust of John Brown was standing. The\r\n     sight of it, which was new to her, threw her into a sort of ecstacy\r\n     of sorrow and admiration, and she went on in her rhapsodical way to\r\n     pronounce his apotheosis.\r\n\r\n     She has often been in Concord, where she resided at the houses of\r\n     Emerson, Alcott, the Whitneys, the Brooks family, Mrs. Horace\r\n     Mann, and other well known persons. They all admired and respected\r\n     her, and nobody doubted the reality of her adventures. She was too\r\n     _real_ a person to be suspected. In 1862, I think it was, she went\r\n     from Boston to Port Royal, under the advice and encouragement of\r\n     Mr. Garrison, Governor Andrew, Dr. Howe, and other leading people.\r\n     Her career in South Carolina is well known to some of our officers,\r\n     and I think to Colonel Higginson, now of Newport, R. I., and\r\n     Colonel James Montgomery, of Kansas, to both of whom she was useful\r\n     as a spy and guide, if I mistake not. I regard her as, on the\r\n     whole, the most extraordinary person of her race I have ever met.\r\n     She is a negro of pure or almost pure blood, can neither read nor\r\n     write, and has the characteristics of her race and condition. But\r\n     she has done what can scarcely be credited on the best authority,\r\n     and she has accomplished her purposes with a coolness, foresight,\r\n     patience, and wisdom, which in a _white man_ would have raised him\r\n     to the highest pitch of reputation.\r\n\r\n     I am, dear Madame, very truly your servant,\r\n\r\n     F. B. SANBORN.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the \"dreams and visions\" mentioned in this letter, the writer might\r\nhave given many wonderful instances; but it was thought best not to\r\ninsert anything which, with any, might bring discredit upon the story.\r\nWhen these turns of somnolency come upon Harriet, she imagines that her\r\n\"spirit\" leaves her body, and visits other scenes and places, not only\r\nin this world, but in the world of spirits. And her ideas of these\r\nscenes show, to say the least of it, a vividness of imagination seldom\r\nequaled in the soarings of the most cultivated minds.\r\n\r\nNot long since, the writer, on going into Harriet's room in the morning,\r\nsat down by her and began to read that wonderful and glorious\r\ndescription of the heavenly Jerusalem in the two last chapters of\r\nRevelations. When the reading was finished, Harriet burst into a\r\nrhapsody which perfectly amazed her hearer--telling of what she had seen\r\nin one of these visions, sights which no one could doubt had been real\r\nto her, and which no human imagination could have conceived, it would\r\nseem, unless in dream or vision. There was a wild poetry in these\r\ndescriptions which seemed to border almost on inspiration, but by many\r\nthey might be characterized as the ravings of insanity. All that can be\r\nsaid is, however, if this woman is insane, there has been a wonderful\r\n\"method in her madness.\"\r\n\r\nAt one time, Harriet was much troubled in spirit about her three\r\nbrothers, feeling sure that some great evil was impending over their\r\nheads. She wrote a letter, by the hand of a friend, to a man named Jacob\r\nJackson, who lived near there. Jacob was a free negro, who could both\r\nread and write, and who was under suspicion at that time, as it was\r\nthought he had something to do with the disappearance of so many slaves.\r\nIt was necessary, therefore, to be very cautious in writing to him.\r\nJacob had an adopted son, William Henry Jackson, also free, who had come\r\nSouth; and so Harriet determined to sign her letter with his name,\r\nknowing that Jacob would be clever enough to understand, by her peculiar\r\nphraseology, what meaning she intended to convey to him. She, therefore,\r\nafter speaking of indifferent matters, said, \"Read my letter to the old\r\nfolks, and give my love to them, and tell my brothers to be always\r\n_watching unto prayer_, and when the _good old ship of Zion comes along,\r\nto be ready to step aboard_.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter was signed \"William Henry Jackson.\" Jacob was not allowed to\r\nhave his letters till the self-elected inspectors had had the reading of\r\nthem, and studied into their secret meaning. They, therefore, got\r\ntogether, wiped their glasses, and got them on, and proceeded to a\r\ncareful perusal of this mysterious document. What it meant, they could\r\nnot imagine; William Henry Jackson had no parents or brothers, and the\r\nletter was incomprehensible. White genius having exhausted itself, black\r\ngenius was called in, and Jacob's letter was at last handed to him.\r\nJacob saw at once what it meant, but tossed it down, saying, \"Dat letter\r\ncan't be meant for me, no how. I can't make head nor tail of it,\" and\r\nwalked off and took immediate measures to let Harriet's brothers know\r\nsecretly that she was coming, and they must be ready to start at a\r\nmoment's notice for the North. When Harriet arrived there, it was the\r\nday before Christmas, and she found her three brothers, who had\r\nattempted to escape, were advertised to be sold on Christmas day to the\r\nhighest bidder, to go down to the cotton and rice fields with the\r\nchain-gang. Christmas came on Sunday, and therefore they were not to be\r\nsold till Monday. Harriet arrived on Saturday, and gave them secret\r\nnotice to be ready to start Saturday night, immediately after dark, the\r\nfirst stopping-place to be their father's cabin, forty miles away. When\r\nthey assembled, their brother John was missing; but when Harriet was\r\nready, the word was \"Forward!\" and she \"nebber waited for no one.\" Poor\r\nJohn was almost ready to start, when his wife was taken ill, and in an\r\nhour or two, another little inheritor of the blessings of slavery had\r\ncome into the world. John must go off for a \"Granny,\" and then he would\r\nnot leave his wife in her present circumstances. But after the birth of\r\nthe child, he began to think he must start; the North and Liberty, or\r\nthe South and life-long Slavery--these were the alternatives, and this\r\nwas his last chance. He tried again and again to steal out of the door,\r\nbut a watchful eye was on him, and he was always arrested by the\r\nquestion, \"Where you gwine, John?\" At length he told her he was going to\r\ntry to see if he couldn't get hired out on Christmas to another man. His\r\nwife did not think that he was to be sold. He went out of the door, and\r\nstood by the corner of the house, near her bed, listening. At length, he\r\nheard her sobbing and crying, and not being able to endure it, he went\r\nback. \"Oh! John,\" said his wife, \"you's gwine to lebe me; but, wherebber\r\nyou go, remember me an' de chillen.\" John went out and started at full\r\nspeed for his father's cabin, forty miles away. At daybreak, he overtook\r\nthe others in the \"fodder house,\" near the cabin of their parents.\r\nHarriet had not seen her mother there for six years, but they did not\r\ndare to let the old woman know of their being in her neighborhood, or of\r\ntheir intentions, for she would have raised such an uproar in her\r\nefforts to detain them with her, that the whole plantation would have\r\nbeen alarmed. The poor old woman had been expecting the boys all day, to\r\nspend Christmas with her as usual. She had been hard at work, had killed\r\na pig, and put it to all the various uses to which sinner's flesh is\r\ndoomed, and had made all the preparations her circumstances admitted of,\r\nto give them a sumptuous entertainment, and there she sat watching. In\r\nthe night, when Harriet and two of her brothers and two other men, who\r\nhad escaped with them, arrived at the \"fodder house,\" they were\r\nexhausted and famished. They sent the two strange men up to the house to\r\ntry and speak to \"Old Ben,\" their father, but not to let their mother\r\nknow of their being in the neighborhood. The men succeeded in rousing\r\nold Ben, who came out, and as soon as he heard their story, he gathered\r\ntogether a quantity of provisions, and came down to the fodder house,\r\nand slipped them inside the door, taking care not to _see_ his\r\nchildren. Up among the ears of corn they lay, and one of them he had\r\nnot seen for six years. It rained very hard all that Sunday, and there\r\nthey lay all day, for they could not start till night. At about\r\ndaybreak, John joined them. There were wide chinks in the boards of the\r\nfodder house, and through them they could see their father's cabin; and\r\nall day long, every few minutes, they would see the old woman come out,\r\nand, shading her eyes with her hand, take a long look down the road to\r\nsee if her children were coming, and then they could almost hear her\r\nsigh as she turned into the house, disappointed.\r\n\r\nTwo or three times the old man came down, and pushed food inside the\r\ndoor, and after nightfall he came to accompany them part of the way upon\r\ntheir journey. When he reached the fodder house, he tied his\r\nhandkerchief tight over his eyes, and two of his sons taking him by each\r\narm, he accompanied them some miles upon their journey. They then bade\r\nhim farewell, and left him standing blind-fold in the middle of the\r\nroad. When he could no longer hear their footsteps, he took off the\r\nhandkerchief, and turned back.\r\n\r\nBut before leaving, they had gone up to the cabin to take a silent\r\nfarewell of the poor old mother. Through the little window of the cabin,\r\nthey saw the old woman sitting by her fire with a pipe in her mouth, her\r\nhead on her hand, rocking back and forth as she did when she was in\r\ntrouble, and wondering what new evil had come to her children. With\r\nstreaming eyes, they watched her for ten or fifteen minutes; but time\r\nwas precious, and they must reach their next station before daybreak,\r\nand so they turned sadly away.\r\n\r\nWhen the holidays were over, and the men came for the three brothers to\r\nsell them, they could not be found. The first place to search was of\r\ncourse the plantation where all their relatives and friends lived. They\r\nwent to the \"big house,\" and asked the \"Doctor\" if he had seen anything\r\nof them. The Doctor said, \"No, they mostly came up there to see the\r\nother niggers when they came for Christmas,\" but they hadn't been round\r\nat all. \"Have you been down to Old Ben's?\" the Doctor asked. \"Yes.\"\r\n\"What does Old Rit say?\" \"Old Rit says not one of 'em came this\r\nChristmas. She was looking for 'em most all day, and most broke her\r\nheart about it.\" \"What does Old Ben say?\" \"Old Ben says that he hasn't\r\nseen one of his children this Christmas.\" \"Well, if Old Ben says that,\r\nthey haven't been round.\" And so the man-hunters went off disappointed.\r\n\r\nOne of the other brothers, William Henry, had long been attached to a\r\ngirl named Catherine, who lived with another master; but her master\r\nwould not let her marry him. When William Henry made up his mind to\r\nstart with Harriet, he determined to bring Catherine with him. And so he\r\nwent to a tailor's, and bought a new suit of men's clothes, and threw\r\nthem over the garden fence of Catherine's master. The garden ran down to\r\na run, and Catherine had been notified where to find the clothes. When\r\nthe time had come to get ready, Catherine went to the foot of the garden\r\nand dressed herself in the suit of men's clothes. She was soon missed,\r\nand all the girls in the house were set to looking for Catherine.\r\nPresently they saw coming up through the garden, as if from the river, a\r\nwell-dressed little darkey, and they all stopped looking for Catherine\r\nto stare at him. He walked directly by them round the house, and went\r\nout of the gate, without the slightest suspicion being excited as to who\r\nhe was. In a fortnight from that time, the whole party were safe in\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nWilliam Henry died in Canada, but Catherine has been seen and talked\r\nwith by the writer, at the house of the old people.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the many letters, testimonials, and passes, placed in the hands of\r\nthe writer by Harriet, the following are selected for insertion in this\r\nbook, and are quite sufficient to verify her statements.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Letter from Gen. Saxton to a Lady of Auburn._\r\n\r\n\r\n     ATLANTA, GA., March 21, 1868.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR MADAME: I have just received your letter informing me that\r\n     Hon. Wm. H. Seward, Secretary of State, would present a petition to\r\n     Congress for a pension to Harriet Tubman, for services rendered in\r\n     the Union Army during the late war. I can bear witness to the value\r\n     of her services in South Carolina and Florida. She was employed in\r\n     the hospitals and as a spy. She made many a raid inside the enemy's\r\n     lines, displaying remarkable courage, zeal, and fidelity. She was\r\n     employed by General Hunter, and I think by Generals Stevens and\r\n     Sherman, and is as deserving of a pension from the Government for\r\n     her services as any other of its faithful servants.\r\n\r\n     I am very truly yours,\r\n\r\n     RUFUS SAXTON, Bvt. Brig.-Gen. U. S. A.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter from Hon. Wm. H. Seward._\r\n\r\n\r\n     WASHINGTON, July 25, 1868.\r\n\r\n     MAJ.-GEN. HUNTER--\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SIR: Harriet Tubman, a colored woman, has been nursing our\r\n     soldiers during nearly all the war. She believes she has a claim\r\n     for faithful services to the command in South Carolina with which\r\n     you are connected, and she thinks that you would be disposed to see\r\n     her claim justly settled.\r\n\r\n     I have known her long, and a nobler, higher spirit, or a truer,\r\n     seldom dwells in the human form. I commend her, therefore, to your\r\n     kind and best attentions.\r\n\r\n     Faithfully your friend,\r\n\r\n     WILLIAM H. SEWARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter from Col.

GILMAN, Commanding Department of the South--\r\n\r\n     GENERAL: I wish to commend to your attention, Mrs. Harriet Tubman,\r\n     a most remarkable woman, and invaluable as a scout. I have been\r\n     acquainted with her character and actions for several years.\r\n\r\n     Walter D. Plowden is a man of tried courage, and can be made\r\n     highly useful.\r\n\r\n     I am, General, your most ob't servant,\r\n\r\n     JAMES MONTGOMERY, Col. Com. Brigade.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter from Mrs. Gen. A.

Gerrit Smith, as a person of great rectitude and\r\n     capabilities.\r\n\r\n     MRS. GEN. A. BAIRD.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter from Hon. Gerrit Smith._\r\n\r\n\r\n     PETERBORO, N. Y., Nov. 4, 1867.\r\n\r\n     I have known Mrs. Harriet Tubman for many years. Seldom, if ever,\r\n     have I met with a person more philanthropic, more self-denying,\r\n     and of more bravery. Nor must I omit to say that she combines with\r\n     her sublime spirit, remarkable discernment and judgment.\r\n\r\n     During the late war, Mrs. Tubman was eminently faithful and useful\r\n     to the cause of our country. She is poor and has poor parents. Such\r\n     a servant of the country should be well paid by the country. I hope\r\n     that the Government will look into her case.\r\n\r\n     GERRIT SMITH.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Testimonial from Gerrit Smith._\r\n\r\n\r\n     PETERBORO, Nov. 22, 1864.\r\n\r\n     The bearer, Harriet Tubman, needs not any recommendation. Nearly\r\n     all the nation over, she has been heard of for her wisdom,\r\n     integrity, patriotism, and bravery. The cause of freedom owes her\r\n     much. The country owes her much.\r\n\r\n     I have known Harriet for many years, and I hold her in my high\r\n     esteem.\r\n\r\n     GERRIT SMITH.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Certificate from Henry K.

Henry Fowler\r\nis received:\r\n\r\n\r\n     AUBURN, June 23, 1868.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR FRIEND:--I wish to say to you how gratified I am that you\r\n     are writing the biography of Harriet Tubman. I feel that her life\r\n     forms part of the history of the country, and that it ought not to\r\n     depend upon tradition to keep it in remembrance. Had not the\r\n     pressure of professional claims prevented, I should have aspired to\r\n     be her historian myself; but my disappointment in this regard is\r\n     more than met by the satisfaction experienced in hearing that you\r\n     are the chosen Miriam of this African \"Moses;\" the name by which\r\n     she was known among her emancipated followers from the land of\r\n     bondage. Blessed be God! a \"Greater than Moses\" has at last broken\r\n     every bond.\r\n\r\n     As ever, with warm regard, your friend,\r\n\r\n     HENRY FOWLER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following account of the subject of this memoir is cut from the\r\n_Boston Commonwealth_ of 1863, kindly sent the writer by Mr. Sanborn:\r\n\r\n\"It was said long ago that the true romance of America was not in the\r\nfortunes of the Indian, where Cooper sought it, nor in the New England\r\ncharacter, where Judd found it, nor in the social contrasts of Virginia\r\nplanters, as Thackeray imagined, but in the story of the fugitive\r\nslaves. The observation is as true now as it was before war, with swift,\r\ngigantic hand, sketched the vast shadows, and dashed in the high lights\r\nin which romance loves to lurk and flash forth. But the stage is\r\nenlarged on which these dramas are played, the whole world now sit as\r\nspectators, and the desperation or the magnanimity of a poor black woman\r\nhas power to shake the nation that so long was deaf to her cries. We\r\nwrite of one of these heroines, of whom our slave annals are full,--a\r\nwoman whose career is as extraordinary as the most famous of her sex can\r\nshow.\r\n\r\n\"Araminta Ross, now known by her married name of Tubman, with her\r\nsounding Christian name changed to Harriet, is the grand-daughter of a\r\nslave imported from Africa, and has not a drop of white blood in her\r\nveins. Her parents were Benjamin Ross and Harriet Greene, both slaves,\r\nbut married and faithful to each other. They still live in old age and\r\npoverty, but free, on a little property at Auburn, N. Y., which their\r\ndaughter purchased for them from Mr. Seward, the Secretary of State. She\r\nwas born, as near as she can remember, in 1820 or in 1821, in Dorchester\r\nCounty, on the Eastern shore of Maryland, and not far from the town of\r\nCambridge. She had ten brothers and sisters, of whom three are now\r\nliving, all at the North, and all rescued from slavery by Harriet,\r\nbefore the War. She went back just as the South was preparing to secede,\r\nto bring away a fourth, but before she could reach her, she was dead.\r\nThree years before, she had brought away her old father and mother, at\r\ngreat risk to herself.\r\n\r\n\"When Harriet was six years old, she was taken from her mother and\r\ncarried ten miles to live with James Cook, whose wife was a weaver, to\r\nlearn the trade of weaving. While still a mere child, Cook set her to\r\nwatching his musk-rat traps, which compelled her to wade through the\r\nwater. It happened that she was once sent when she was ill with the\r\nmeasles, and, taking cold from wading in the water in this condition,\r\nshe grew very sick, and her mother persuaded her master to take her\r\naway from Cook's until she could get well.\r\n\r\n\"Another attempt was made to teach her weaving, but she would not learn,\r\nfor she hated her mistress, and did not want to live at home, as she\r\nwould have done as a weaver, for it was the custom then to weave the\r\ncloth for the family, or a part of it, in the house.\r\n\r\n\"Soon after she entered her teens she was hired out as a field hand, and\r\nit was while thus employed that she received a wound which nearly proved\r\nfatal, from the effects of which she still suffers. In the fall of the\r\nyear, the slaves there work in the evening, cleaning up wheat, husking\r\ncorn, etc. On this occasion, one of the slaves of a farmer named\r\nBarrett, left his work, and went to the village store in the evening.\r\nThe overseer followed him, and so did Harriet. When the slave was found,\r\nthe overseer swore he should be whipped, and called on Harriet, among\r\nothers, to help tie him. She refused, and as the man ran away, she\r\nplaced herself in the door to stop pursuit. The overseer caught up a\r\ntwo-pound weight from the counter and threw it at the fugitive, but it\r\nfell short and struck Harriet a stunning blow on the head. It was long\r\nbefore she recovered from this, and it has left her subject to a sort\r\nof stupor or lethargy at times; coming upon her in the midst of\r\nconversation, or whatever she may be doing, and throwing her into a deep\r\nslumber, from which she will presently rouse herself, and go on with her\r\nconversation or work.\r\n\r\n\"After this she lived for five or six years with John Stewart, where at\r\nfirst she worked in the house, but afterwards 'hired her time,' and Dr.\r\nThompson, son of her master's guardian, 'stood for her,' that is, was\r\nher surety for the payment of what she owed. She employed the time thus\r\nhired in the rudest labors,--drove oxen, carted, plowed, and did all the\r\nwork of a man,--sometimes earning money enough in a year, beyond what\r\nshe paid her master, 'to buy a pair of steers,' worth forty dollars. The\r\namount exacted of a woman for her time was fifty or sixty dollars--of a\r\nman, one hundred to one hundred and fifty dollars. Frequently Harriet\r\nworked for her father, who was a timber inspector, and superintended the\r\ncutting and hauling of great quantities of timber for the Baltimore\r\nship-yards. Stewart, his temporary master, was a builder, and for the\r\nwork of Ross used to receive as much as five dollars a day sometimes, he\r\nbeing a superior workman. While engaged with her father, she would cut\r\nwood, haul logs, etc. Her usual 'stint' was half a cord of wood in a\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\"Harriet was married somewhere about 1844, to a free colored man named\r\nJohn Tubman, but she had no children. For the last two years of slavery\r\nshe lived with Dr. Thompson, before mentioned, her own master not being\r\nyet of age, and Dr. T.'s father being his guardian, as well as the owner\r\nof her own father. In 1849 the young man died, and the slaves were to be\r\nsold, though previously set free by an old will. Harriet resolved not to\r\nbe sold, and so, with no knowledge of the North--having only heard of\r\nPennsylvania and New Jersey--she walked away one night alone. She found\r\na friend in a white lady, who knew her story and helped her on her way.\r\nAfter many adventures, she reached Philadelphia, where she found work\r\nand earned a small stock of money. With this money in her purse, she\r\ntraveled back to Maryland for her husband, but she found him married to\r\nanother woman, and no longer caring to live with her. This, however, was\r\nnot until two years after her escape, for she does not seem to have\r\nreached her old home in her first two expeditions. In December, 1850,\r\nshe had visited Baltimore and brought away her sister and two children,\r\nwho had come up from Cambridge in a boat, under charge of her sister's\r\nhusband, a free black. A few months after she had brought away her\r\nbrother and two other men, but it was not till the fall of 1851 that she\r\nfound her husband and learned of his infidelity. She did not give way to\r\nrage or grief, but collected a party of fugitives and brought them\r\nsafely to Philadelphia. In December of the same year, she returned, and\r\nled out a party of eleven, among them her brother and his wife. With\r\nthese she journeyed to Canada, and there spent the winter, for this was\r\nafter the enforcement of Mason's Fugitive Slave Bill in Philadelphia and\r\nBoston, and there was no safety except 'under the paw of the British\r\nLion,' as she quaintly said. But the first winter was terribly severe\r\nfor these poor runaways. They earned their bread by chopping wood in the\r\nsnows of a Canadian forest; they were frost-bitten, hungry, and naked.\r\nHarriet was their good angel. She kept house for her brother, and the\r\npoor creatures boarded with her. She worked for them, begged for them,\r\nprayed for them, with the strange familiarity of communion with God\r\nwhich seems natural to these people, and carried them by the help of God\r\nthrough the hard winter.\r\n\r\n\"In the Spring she returned to the States, and as usual earned money by\r\nworking in hotels and families as a cook. From Cape May, in the fall of\r\n1852, she went back once more to Maryland, and brought away nine more\r\nfugitives.\r\n\r\n\"Up to this time she had expended chiefly her own money in these\r\nexpeditions--money which she had earned by hard work in the drudgery of\r\nthe kitchen. Never did any one more exactly fulfill the sense of George\r\nHerbert--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"A servant with this clause\r\n     Makes drudgery divine.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But it was not possible for such virtues long to remain hidden from the\r\nkeen eyes of the Abolitionists. She became known to Thomas Garrett, the\r\nlarge-hearted Quaker of Wilmington, who has aided the escape of three\r\nthousand fugitives; she found warm friends in Philadelphia and New York,\r\nand wherever she went. These gave her money, which she never spent for\r\nher own use, but laid up for the help of her people, and especially for\r\nher journeys back to the 'land of Egypt,' as she called her old home. By\r\nreason of her frequent visits there, always carrying away some of the\r\noppressed, she got among her people the name of 'Moses,' which it seems\r\nshe still retains.\r\n\r\n\"Between 1852 and 1857, she made but two of these journeys, in\r\nconsequence partly of the increased vigilance of the slaveholders, who\r\nhad suffered so much by the loss of their property. A great reward was\r\noffered for her capture, and she several times was on the point of being\r\ntaken, but always escaped by her quick wit, or by 'warnings' from\r\nHeaven--for it is time to notice one singular trait in her character.\r\nShe is the most shrewd and practical person in the world, yet she is a\r\nfirm believer in omens, dreams, and warnings. She declares that before\r\nher escape from slavery, she used to dream of flying over fields and\r\ntowns, and rivers and mountains, looking down upon them 'like a bird,'\r\nand reaching at last a great fence, or sometimes a river, over which she\r\nwould try to fly, 'but it 'peared like I wouldn't hab de strength, and\r\njes as I was sinkin' down, dare would be ladies all drest in white ober\r\ndere, and dey would put out dere arms and pull me 'cross.' There is\r\nnothing strange in this, perhaps, but she declares that when she came\r\nNorth she remembered these very places as those she had seen in her\r\ndreams, and many of the ladies who befriended her were those she had\r\nbeen helped by in her visions.\r\n\r\n\"Then she says she always knows when there is danger near her,--she\r\ndoes not know how, exactly, but ''pears like my heart go flutter,\r\nflutter, and den dey may say \"Peace, Peace,\" as much as dey likes, _I\r\nknow its gwine to be war!_' She is very firm on this point, and ascribes\r\nto this her great impunity, in spite of the lethargy before mentioned,\r\nwhich would seem likely to throw her into the hands of her enemies. She\r\nsays she inherited this power, that her father could always predict the\r\nweather, and that he foretold the Mexican war.\r\n\r\n\"In 1867 she made her most venturesome journey, for she brought with her\r\nto the North her old parents, who were no longer able to walk such\r\ndistances as she must go by night. Consequently she must hire a wagon\r\nfor them, and it required all her ingenuity to get them through Maryland\r\nand Delaware safe. She accomplished it, however, and by the aid of her\r\nfriends she brought them safe to Canada, where they spent the winter.\r\nHer account of their sufferings there--of her mother's complaining and\r\nher own philosophy about it--is a lesson of trust in Providence better\r\nthan many sermons. But she decided to bring them to a more comfortable\r\nplace, and so she negotiated with Mr. Seward--then in the Senate--for a\r\nlittle patch of ground with a house on it, at Auburn, near his own\r\nhome. To the credit of the Secretary of State it should be said, that\r\nhe sold her the property on very favorable terms, and gave her some time\r\nfor payment. To this house she removed her parents, and set herself to\r\nwork to pay for her purchase. It was on this errand that she first\r\nvisited Boston--we believe in the winter of 1858-9. She brought a few\r\nletters from her friends in New York, but she could herself neither read\r\nnor write, and she was obliged to trust to her wits that they were\r\ndelivered to the right persons. One of them, as it happened, was to the\r\npresent writer, who received it by another hand, and called to see her\r\nat her boarding-house. It was curious to see the caution with which she\r\nreceived her visitor until she felt assured that there was no mistake.\r\nOne of her means of security was to carry with her the daguerreotypes of\r\nher friends, and show them to each new person. If they recognized the\r\nlikeness, then it was all right.\r\n\r\n\"Pains were taken to secure her the attention to which her great\r\nservices to humanity entitled her, and she left New England with a\r\nhandsome sum of money towards the payment of her debt to Mr. Seward.\r\nBefore she left, however, she had several interviews with Captain Brown,\r\nthen in Boston. He is supposed to have communicated his plans to her,\r\nand to have been aided by her in obtaining recruits and money among her\r\npeople. At any rate, he always spoke of her with the greatest respect,\r\nand declared that 'General Tubman,' as he styled her, was a better\r\nofficer than most whom he had seen, and could command an army as\r\nsuccessfully as she had led her small parties of fugitives.\r\n\r\n\"Her own veneration for Captain Brown has always been profound, and\r\nsince his murder, has taken the form of a religion. She had often risked\r\nher own life for her people, and she thought nothing of that; but that a\r\nwhite man, and a man so noble and strong, should so take upon himself\r\nthe burden of a despised race, she could not understand, and she took\r\nrefuge from her perplexity in the mysteries of her fervid religion.\r\n\r\n\"Again, she laid great stress on a dream which she had just before she\r\nmet Captain Brown in Canada. She thought she was in 'a wilderness sort\r\nof place, all full of rocks and bushes,' when she saw a serpent raise\r\nits head among the rocks, and as it did so, it became the head of an old\r\nman with a long white beard, gazing at her 'wishful like, jes as ef he\r\nwar gwine to speak to me,' and then two other heads rose up beside him,\r\nyounger than he,--and as she stood looking at them, and wondering what\r\nthey could want with her, a great crowd of men rushed in and struck down\r\nthe younger heads, and then the head of the old man, still looking at\r\nher so 'wishful.' This dream she had again and again, and could not\r\ninterpret it; but when she met Captain Brown, shortly after, behold, he\r\nwas the very image of the head she had seen. But still she could not\r\nmake out what her dream signified, till the news came to her of the\r\ntragedy of Harper's Ferry, and then she knew the two other heads were\r\nhis two sons. She was in New York at that time, and on the day of the\r\naffair at Harper's Ferry, she felt her usual warning that something was\r\nwrong--she could not tell what. Finally she told her hostess that it\r\nmust be Captain Brown who was in trouble, and that they should soon hear\r\nbad news from him. The next day's newspaper brought tidings of what had\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\n\"Her last visit to Maryland was made after this, in December, 1860; and\r\nin spite of the agitated condition of the country, and the greater\r\nwatchfulness of the slaveholders, she brought away seven fugitives, one\r\nof them an infant, which must be drugged with opium to keep it from\r\ncrying on the way, and so revealing the hiding place of the party. She\r\nbrought these safely to New York, but there a new difficulty met her. It\r\nwas the mad winter of compromises, when State after State, and\r\npolitician after politician, went down on their knees to beg the South\r\nnot to secede. The hunting of fugitive slaves began again. Mr. Seward\r\nwent over to the side of compromise. He knew the history of this poor\r\nwoman; he had given his enemies a hold on him, by dealing with her; it\r\nwas thought he would not scruple to betray her. The suspicion was an\r\nunworthy one, for though the Secretary could betray a cause, he could\r\nnot surely have put her enemies on the track of a woman who was thus in\r\nhis power, after such a career as hers had been. But so little\r\nconfidence was then felt in Mr. Seward, by men who had voted for him and\r\nwith him, that they hurried Harriet off to Canada, sorely against her\r\nwill.\r\n\r\n\"She did not long remain there. The war broke out, for which she had\r\nbeen long looking, and she hastened to her New England friends to\r\nprepare for another expedition to Maryland, to bring away the last of\r\nher family.\r\n\r\n\"Before she could start, however, the news came of the capture of Port\r\nRoyal. Instantly she conceived the idea of going there and working\r\namong her people on the islands and the mainland. Money was given her,\r\na pass was secured through the agency of Governor Andrew, and she went\r\nto Beaufort. There she has made herself useful in many ways--has been\r\nemployed as a spy by General Hunter, and finally has piloted Col.\r\nMontgomery on his most successful expedition. We gave some notice of\r\nthis fact last week. Since then we have received the following letter,\r\ndictated by her, from which it appears that she needs some contributions\r\nfor her work. We trust she will receive them, for none has better\r\ndeserved it. She asks nothing for herself, except that her wardrobe may\r\nbe replenished, and even this she will probably share with the first\r\nneedy person she meets.\r\n\r\n\"'BEAUFORT, S. C., June 30, 1863.\r\n\r\n* * * \"'Last fall, when the people here became very much alarmed for\r\nfear of an invasion from the rebels, all my clothes were packed and sent\r\nwith others to Hilton Head, and lost; and I have never been able to get\r\nany trace of them since. I was sick at the time, and unable to look\r\nafter them myself. I want, among the rest, a _bloomer_ dress, made of\r\nsome coarse, strong material, to wear on _expeditions_. In our late\r\nexpedition up the Combahee River, in coming on board the boat, I was\r\ncarrying _two pigs_ for a poor sick woman, who had a child to carry, and\r\nthe order \"double quick\" was given, and I started to run, stepped on my\r\ndress, it being rather long, and fell and tore it almost off, so that\r\nwhen I got on board the boat, there was hardly anything left of it but\r\nshreds. I made up my mind then I would never wear a long dress on\r\nanother expedition of the kind, but would have a _bloomer_ as soon as I\r\ncould get it. So please make this known to the ladies, if you will, for\r\nI expect to have use for it very soon, probably before they can get it\r\nto me.\r\n\r\n\"'You have, without doubt, seen a full account of the expedition I refer\r\nto. Don't you think we colored people are entitled to some credit for\r\nthat exploit, under the lead of the brave Colonel Montgomery? We\r\nweakened the rebels somewhat on the Combahee River, by taking and\r\nbringing away _seven hundred and fifty-six_ head of their most valuable\r\nlive stock, known up in your region as \"contrabands,\" and this, too,\r\nwithout the loss of a single life on our part, though we had good reason\r\nto believe that a number of rebels bit the dust. Of these seven hundred\r\nand fifty-six contrabands, nearly or quite all the able-bodied men have\r\njoined the colored regiments here.\r\n\r\n\"'I have now been absent two years almost, and have just got letters\r\nfrom my friends in Auburn, urging me to come home. My father and mother\r\nare old and in feeble health, and need my care and attention. I hope the\r\ngood people there will not allow them to suffer, and I do not believe\r\nthey will. But I do not see how I am to leave at present the very\r\nimportant work to be done here. Among other duties which I have, is that\r\nof looking after the hospital here for contrabands. Most of those coming\r\nfrom the mainland are very destitute, almost naked. I am trying to find\r\nplaces for those able to work, and provide for them as best I can, so as\r\nto lighten the burden on the Government as much as possible, while at\r\nthe same time they learn to respect themselves by earning their own\r\nliving.\r\n\r\n\"'Remember me very kindly to Mrs. ---- and her daughters; also, if you\r\nwill, to my Boston friends, Mrs. C., Miss H., and especially to Mr. and\r\nMrs. George L. Stearns, to whom I am under great obligations for their\r\nmany kindnesses. I shall be sure to come and see you all if I live to go\r\nNorth. If you write, direct your letter to the care of C.'\"\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 1860, Harriet Tubman was requested by Mr. Gerrit Smith\r\nto go to Boston to attend a large Anti-Slavery meeting. On her way, she\r\nstopped at Troy to visit a cousin, and while there, the colored people\r\nwere one day startled with the intelligence that a fugitive slave, by\r\nthe name of Charles Nalle, had been followed by his master (who was his\r\nyounger brother, and not one grain whiter than he), and that he was\r\nalready in the hands of the officers, and was to be taken back to the\r\nSouth. The instant Harriet heard the news, she started for the office of\r\nthe U. S. Commissioner, scattering the tidings as she went. An excited\r\ncrowd were gathered about the office, through which Harriet forced her\r\nway, and rushed up stairs to the door of the room where the fugitive was\r\ndetained. A wagon was already waiting before the door to carry off the\r\nman, but the crowd was even then so great, and in such a state of\r\nexcitement, that the officers did not dare to bring the man down. On the\r\nopposite side of the street stood the colored people, watching the\r\nwindow where they could see Harriet's sun-bonnet, and feeling assured\r\nthat so long as she stood there, the fugitive was still in the office.\r\nTime passed on, and he did not appear. \"They've taken him out another\r\nway, depend upon that,\" said some of the colored people. \"No,\" replied\r\nothers, \"there stands 'Moses' yet, and as long as she is there, he is\r\nsafe.\" Harriet, now seeing the necessity for a tremendous effort for his\r\nrescue, sent out some little boys to cry _fire_. The bells rang, the\r\ncrowd increased, till the whole street was a dense mass of people. Again\r\nand again the officers came out to try and clear the stairs, and make a\r\nway to take their captive down; others were driven down, but Harriet\r\nstood her ground, her head bent down, and her arms folded. \"Come, old\r\nwoman, you must get out of this,\" said one of the officers; \"I must have\r\nthe way cleared; if you can't get down alone, some one will help you.\"\r\nHarriet, still putting on a greater appearance of decrepitude, twitched\r\naway from him, and kept her place. Offers were made to buy Charles from\r\nhis master, who at first agreed to take twelve hundred dollars for him;\r\nbut when that was subscribed, he immediately raised the price to fifteen\r\nhundred. The crowd grew more excited. A gentleman raised a window and\r\ncalled out, \"Two hundred dollars for his rescue, but not one cent to his\r\nmaster!\" This was responded to by a roar of satisfaction from the crowd\r\nbelow. At length the officers appeared, and announced to the crowd that\r\nif they would open a lane to the wagon, they would promise to bring the\r\nman down the front way.\r\n\r\nThe lane was opened, and the man was brought out--a tall, handsome,\r\nintelligent _white_ man, with his wrists manacled together, walking\r\nbetween the U. S. Marshal and another officer, and behind him his\r\nbrother and his master, so like him that one could hardly be told from\r\nthe other. The moment they appeared, Harriet roused from her stooping\r\nposture, threw up a window, and cried to her friends: \"Here he\r\ncomes--take him!\" and then darted down the stairs like a wild-cat. She\r\nseized one officer and pulled him down, then another, and tore him away\r\nfrom the man; and keeping her arms about the slave, she cried to her\r\nfriends: \"Drag us out! Drag him to the river! Drown him! but don't let\r\nthem have him!\" They were knocked down together, and while down she tore\r\noff her sun-bonnet and tied it on the head of the fugitive. When he\r\nrose, only his head could be seen, and amid the surging mass of people\r\nthe slave was no longer recognized, while the master appeared like the\r\nslave. Again and again they were knocked down, the poor slave utterly\r\nhelpless, with his manacled wrists streaming with blood. Harriet's\r\nouter clothes were torn from her, and even her stout shoes were all\r\npulled from her feet, yet she never relinquished her hold of the man,\r\ntill she had dragged him to the river, where he was tumbled into a boat,\r\nHarriet following in a ferry-boat to the other side. But the telegraph\r\nwas ahead of them, and as soon as they landed he was seized and hurried\r\nfrom her sight. After a time, some school children came hurrying along,\r\nand to her anxious inquiries they answered, \"He is up in that house, in\r\nthe third story.\" Harriet rushed up to the place. Some men were\r\nattempting to make their way up the stairs. The officers were firing\r\ndown, and two men were lying on the stairs, who had been shot. Over\r\ntheir bodies our heroine rushed, and with the help of others burst open\r\nthe door of the room, dragged out the fugitive, whom Harriet carried\r\ndown stairs in her arms. A gentleman who was riding by with a fine\r\nhorse, stopped to ask what the disturbance meant; and on hearing the\r\nstory, his sympathies seemed to be thoroughly aroused; he sprang from\r\nhis wagon, calling out, \"That is a blood-horse, drive him till he\r\ndrops.\" The poor man was hurried in; some of his friends jumped in after\r\nhim, and drove at the most rapid rate to Schenectady.\r\n\r\nThis is the story Harriet told to the writer. By some persons it seemed\r\ntoo wonderful for belief, and an attempt was made to corroborate it.\r\nRev. Henry Fowler, who was at the time at Saratoga, kindly volunteered\r\nto go to Troy and ascertain the facts. His report was, that he had had a\r\nlong interview with Mr. Townsend, who acted during the trial as counsel\r\nfor the slave, that he had given him a \"rich narration,\" which he would\r\nwrite out the next week for this little book. But before he was to begin\r\nhis generous labor, and while engaged in some kind efforts for the\r\nprisoners at Auburn, he was stricken down by the heat of the sun, and is\r\nfor a long time debarred from labor.\r\n\r\n\r\nFUGITIVE SLAVE RESCUE IN TROY.\r\n\r\nFrom the Troy Whig, April 28, 1859.\r\n\r\nYesterday afternoon, the streets of this city and West Troy were made\r\nthe scenes of unexampled excitement. For the first time since the\r\npassage of the Fugitive Slave Law, an attempt was made here to carry its\r\nprovisions into execution, and the result was a terrific encounter\r\nbetween the officers and the prisoner's friends, the triumph of mob\r\nlaw, and the final rescue of the fugitive. Our city was thrown into a\r\ngrand state of turmoil, and for a time every other topic was forgotten,\r\nto give place to this new excitement. People did not think last evening\r\nto ask who was nominated at Charleston, or whether the news of the\r\nHeenan and Sayers battle had arrived--everything was merged into the\r\nfugitive slave case, of which it seems the end is not yet.\r\n\r\nCharles Nalle, the fugitive, who was the cause of all this excitement,\r\nwas a slave on the plantation of B. W. Hansborough, in Culpepper County,\r\nVirginia, till the 19th of October, 1858, when he made his escape, and\r\nwent to live in Columbia, Pennsylvania. A wife and five children are\r\nresiding there now. Not long since he came to Sandlake, in this county,\r\nand resided in the family of Mr. Crosby until about three weeks ago.\r\nSince that time, he has been employed as coachman by Uri Gilbert, Esq.,\r\nof this city. He is about thirty years of age, tall, quite\r\nlight-complexioned, and good-looking. He is said to have been an\r\nexcellent and faithful servant.\r\n\r\nAt Sandlake, we understand that Nalle was often seen by one H. F.\r\nAverill, formerly connected with one of the papers of this city, who\r\ncommunicated with his reputed owner in Virginia, and gave the\r\ninformation that led to a knowledge of the whereabouts of the fugitive.\r\nAverill wrote letters for him, and thus obtained an acquaintance with\r\nhis history. Mr. Hansborough sent on an agent, Henry J. Wall, by whom\r\nthe necessary papers were got out to arrest the fugitive.\r\n\r\nYesterday morning about 11 o'clock, Charles Nalle was sent to procure\r\nsome bread for the family by whom he was employed. He failed to return.\r\nAt the baker's, he was arrested by Deputy United States Marshal J. W.\r\nHolmes, and immediately taken before United States Commissioner Miles\r\nBeach. The son of Mr. Gilbert, thinking it strange that he did not come\r\nback, sent to the house of William Henry, on Division Street, where he\r\nboarded, and his whereabouts was discovered.\r\n\r\nThe examination before Commissioner Beach was quite brief. The evidence\r\nof Averill and the agent was taken, and the Commissioner decided to\r\nremand Nalle to Virginia. The necessary papers were made out and given\r\nto the Marshal.\r\n\r\nBy this time it was two o'clock, and the fact began to be noised abroad\r\nthat there was a fugitive slave in Mr. Beach's office, corner of State\r\nand first Streets. People in knots of ten or twelve collected near the\r\nentrance, looking at Nalle, who could be seen at an upper window.\r\nWilliam Henry, a colored man, with whom Nalle boarded, commenced talking\r\nfrom the curb-stone in a loud voice to the crowd. He uttered such\r\nsentences as, \"There is a fugitive slave in that office--pretty soon you\r\nwill see him come forth. He is going to be taken down South, and you\r\nwill have a chance to see him. He is to be taken to the depot, to go to\r\nVirginia in the first train. Keep watch of those stairs, and you will\r\nhave a sight.\" A number of women kept shouting, crying, and by loud\r\nappeals excited the colored persons assembled.\r\n\r\nStill the crowd grew in numbers. Wagons halted in front of the locality,\r\nand were soon piled with spectators. An alarm of fire was sounded, and\r\nhose carriages dashed through the ranks of men, women, and boys; but\r\nthey closed again, and kept looking with expectant eyes at the window\r\nwhere the negro was visible. Meanwhile, angry discussions commenced.\r\nSome persons agitated a rescue, and others favored law and order. Mr.\r\nBrockway, a lawyer, had his coat torn for expressing his sentiments, and\r\nother melees kept the interest alive.\r\n\r\nAll at once there was a wild hulloa, and every eye was turned up to see\r\nthe legs and part of the body of the prisoner protruding from the\r\nsecond-story window, at which he was endeavoring to escape. Then arose a\r\nshout! \"Drop him!\" \"Catch him!\" \"Hurrah!\" But the attempt was a\r\nfruitless one, for somebody in the office pulled Nalle back again, amid\r\nthe shouts of a hundred pair of lungs. The crowd at this time numbered\r\nnearly a thousand persons. Many of them were black, and a good share\r\nwere of the female sex. They blocked up State Street from First Street\r\nto the alley, and kept surging to and fro.\r\n\r\nMartin I. Townsend, Esq., who acted as counsel for the fugitive, did not\r\narrive in the Commissioner's office until a decision had been rendered.\r\nHe immediately went before Judge Gould, of the Supreme Court, and\r\nprocured a writ of habeas corpus in the usual form, _returnable_\r\nimmediately. This was given Deputy Sheriff Nathaniel Upham, who at once\r\nproceeded to Commissioner Beach's office, and served it on Holmes. Very\r\ninjudiciously, the officers proceeded at once to Judge Gould's office,\r\nalthough it was evident they would have to pass through an excited,\r\nunreasonable crowd. As soon as the officers and their prisoner emerged\r\nfrom the door, an old negro, who had been standing at the bottom of the\r\nstairs, shouted, \"Here they come,\" and the crowd made a terrific rush at\r\nthe party.\r\n\r\nFrom the office of Commissioner Beach, in the Mutual Building, to that\r\nof Judge Gould, in Congress Street, is less than two blocks, but it was\r\nmade a regular battle-field. The moment the prisoner emerged from the\r\ndoorway, in custody of Deputy-Sheriff Upham, Chief of Police Quin,\r\nOfficers Cleveland and Holmes, the crowd made one grand charge, and\r\nthose nearest the prisoner seized him violently, with the intention of\r\npulling him away from the officers, but they were foiled; and down First\r\nto Congress Street, and up the latter in front of Judge Gould's\r\nchambers, went the surging mass. Exactly what did go on in the crowd, it\r\nis impossible to say, but the pulling, hauling, mauling, and shouting,\r\ngave evidences of frantic efforts on the part of the rescuers, and a\r\nstern resistance from the conservators of the law. In front of Judge\r\nGould's office the combat was at its height. No stones or other missiles\r\nwere used; the battle was fist to fist. We believe an order was given to\r\ntake the prisoner the other way, and there was a grand rush towards the\r\nWest, past First and River Streets, as far as Dock Street. All this time\r\nthere was a continual melee. Many of the officers were hurt--among them\r\nMr. Upham, whose object was solely to do his duty by taking Nalle before\r\nJudge Gould in accordance with the writ of habeas corpus. A number in\r\nthe crowd were more or less hurt, and it is a wonder that these were not\r\nbadly injured, as pistols were drawn and chisels used.\r\n\r\nThe battle had raged as far as the corner of Dock and Congress Streets,\r\nand the victory remained with the rescuers at last. The officers were\r\ncompletely worn out with their exertions, and it was impossible to\r\ncontinue their hold upon him any longer. Nalle was at liberty. His\r\nfriends rushed him down Dock Street to the lower ferry, where there was\r\na skiff lying ready to start. The fugitive was put in, the ferryman\r\nrowed off, and amid the shouts of hundreds who lined the banks of the\r\nriver, Nalle was carried into Albany County.\r\n\r\nAs the skiff landed in West Troy, a negro sympathizer waded up to the\r\nwaist, and pulled Nalle out of the boat. He went up the hill alone,\r\nhowever, and there who should he meet but Constable Becker? The latter\r\nofficial seeing a man with manacles on, considered it his duty to arrest\r\nhim. He did so, and took him in a wagon to the office of Justice\r\nStewart, on the second floor of the corner building near the ferry. The\r\nJustice was absent.\r\n\r\nWhen the crowd on the Troy bank had seen Nalle safely landed, it was\r\nsuggested that he might be recaptured. Then there was another rush made\r\nfor the steam ferry-boat, which carried over about 400 persons, and left\r\nas many more--a few of the latter being soused in their efforts to get\r\non the boat. On landing in West Troy, there, sure enough, was the\r\nprisoner, locked up in a strong office, protected by Officers Becker,\r\nBrown and Morrison, and the door barricaded.\r\n\r\nNot a moment was lost. Up stairs went a score or more of resolute\r\nmen--the rest \"piling in\" promiscuously, shouting and execrating the\r\nofficers. Soon a stone flew against the door--then another--and bang,\r\nbang! went off a couple of pistols, but the officers who fired them took\r\ngood care to aim pretty high. The assailants were forced to retreat for\r\na moment. \"They've got pistols,\" said one. \"Who cares?\" was the reply;\r\n\"they can only kill a dozen of us--come on.\" More stones and more\r\npistol-shots ensued. At last the door was pulled open by an immense\r\nnegro, and in a moment he was felled by a hatchet in the hands of\r\nDeputy-Sheriff Morrison; but the body of the fallen man blocked up the\r\ndoor so that it could not be shut, and a friend of the prisoner pulled\r\nhim out. Poor fellow! he might well say, \"Save me from my friends.\"\r\nAmid the pulling and hauling, the iron had cut his arms, which were\r\nbleeding profusely, and he could hardly walk, owing to fatigue.\r\n\r\nHe has since arrived safely in Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Statements made by Martin I. Townsend, Esq., of Troy, who was\r\n     counsel for the fugitive, Charles Nalle.\r\n\r\n\r\nNalle is an octoroon; his wife has the same infusion of Caucasian blood.\r\nShe was the daughter of her master, and had, with her sister, been bred\r\nby him in his family, as his own child. When the father died, both of\r\nthese daughters were married and had large families of children. Under\r\nthe highly Christian national laws \"Old Virginny,\" these children were\r\nthe slaves of their grandfather. The old man died, leaving a will,\r\nwhereby he manumitted his daughters and their children, and provided for\r\nthe purchase of the freedom of their husbands. The manumission of the\r\nchildren and grandchildren took effect; but the estate was insufficient\r\nto purchase the husbands of his daughters, and the father of his\r\ngrandchildren. The manumitted, by another Christian, \"conservative,\"\r\nand \"national\" provision of law, were forced to leave the State, while\r\nthe slave husbands remained in slavery. Nalle and his brother-in-law\r\nwere allowed for a while to visit their families outside Virginia about\r\nonce a year, but were at length ordered to provide themselves with new\r\nwives, as they would be allowed to visit their former ones no more. It\r\nwas after this that Nalle and his brother-in-law started for the land of\r\nfreedom, guided by the steady light of the north star. Thank God,\r\nneither family now need fear any earthly master or the bay of the\r\nblood-hound dogging their fugitive steps.\r\n\r\nNalle returned to Troy with his family about July, 1860, and resided\r\nwith them there for more than seven years. They are all now residents of\r\nthe city of Washington, D. C. Nalle and his family are persons of\r\nrefined manners, and of the highest respectability. Several of his\r\nchildren are red-haired, and a stranger would discover no trace of\r\nAfrican blood in their complexions or features. It was the head of this\r\nfamily whom H. F. Averill proposed to doom to returnless exile and\r\nlife-long slavery.\r\n\r\nWhen Nalle was brought from Commissioner Beach's office into the street,\r\nHarriet Tubman, who had been standing with the excited crowd, rushed\r\namongst the foremost to Nalle, and running one of her arms around his\r\nmanacled arm, held on to him without ever loosening her hold through the\r\nmore than half-hour's struggle to Judge Gould's office, and from Judge\r\nGould's office to the dock, where Nalle's liberation was accomplished.\r\nIn the melee, she was repeatedly beaten over the head with policemen's\r\nclubs, but she never for a moment released her hold, but cheered Nalle\r\nand his friends with her voice, and struggled with the officers until\r\nthey were literally worn out with their exertions, and Nalle was\r\nseparated from them.\r\n\r\nTrue, she had strong and earnest helpers in her struggle, some of whom\r\nhad white faces as well as human hearts, and are now in Heaven. But she\r\nexposed herself to the fury of the sympathizers with slavery, without\r\nfear, and suffered their blows without flinching. Harriet crossed the\r\nriver with the crowd, in the ferry-boat, and when the men who led the\r\nassault upon the door of Judge Stewart's office, were stricken down,\r\nHarriet and a number of other colored women rushed over their bodies,\r\nbrought Nalle out, and putting him in the first wagon passing, started\r\nhim for the West.\r\n\r\nA livery team, driven by a colored man, was immediately sent on to\r\nrelieve the other, and Nalle was seen about Troy no more until he\r\nreturned a free man by purchase from his master. Harriet also\r\ndisappeared, and the crowd dispersed. How she came to be in Troy that\r\nday, is entirely unknown to our citizens; and where she hid herself\r\nafter the rescue, is equally a mystery. But her struggle was in the\r\nsight of a thousand, perhaps of five thousand spectators.\r\n\r\nThis woman of whom you have been reading is poor, and partially disabled\r\nfrom her injuries; yet she supports cheerfully and uncomplainingly\r\nherself and her old parents, and always has several poor children in her\r\nhouse, who are dependent entirely upon her exertions. At present she has\r\nthree of these children for whom she is providing, while their parents\r\nare working to pay back money borrowed to bring them on. She also\r\nmaintains by her exertions among the good people of Auburn, two schools\r\nof freedmen at the South, providing them teachers and sending them\r\nclothes and books. She never asks for anything for herself, but she does\r\nask the charity of the public for \"her people.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     For them her tears will fall,\r\n      For them her prayers ascend;\r\n     To them her toils and cares be given,\r\n      Till toils and cares will end.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf any persons are disposed to aid her in her benevolent efforts, they\r\nmay send donations to Rev. S. M. Hopkins, Professor in the Auburn\r\nTheological Seminary, who will make such disposition of the funds sent\r\nas may be designated by the donors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[1] The Wabash\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few circumstances having come out in conversation with Harriet, they\r\nare added here, as they may be of interest to the reader.\r\n\r\nOn asking Harriet particularly as to the age of her mother, she\r\nanswered, \"Well, I'll tell you, Missis. Twenty-three years ago, in\r\nMaryland, I paid a lawyer $5 to look up the will of my mother's first\r\nmaster. He looked back sixty years, and said it was time to give up. I\r\ntold him to go back furder. He went back sixty-five years, and there he\r\nfound the will--giving the girl Ritty to his grand-daughter (Mary\r\nPatterson), to serve her and her offspring till she was forty-five years\r\nof age. This grand-daughter died soon after, unmarried; and as there was\r\nno provision for Ritty, in case of her death, she was actually\r\nemancipated at that time. But no one informed her of the fact, and she\r\nand her dear children remained in bondage till emancipated by the\r\ncourage and determination of this heroic daughter and sister. The old\r\nwoman must then, it seems, be ninety-eight years of age, and the old man\r\nhas probably numbered as many years. And yet these old people, living\r\nout beyond the toll-gate, on the South Street road, Auburn, come in\r\nevery Sunday--more than a mile--to the Central Church. To be sure, deep\r\nslumbers settle down upon them as soon as they are seated, which\r\ncontinue undisturbed till the congregation is dismissed; but they have\r\ndone their best, and who can doubt that they receive a blessing.\r\nImmediately after this they go to class-meeting at the Methodist Church.\r\nThen they wait for a third service, and after that start out home\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nOn asking Harriet where they got anything to eat on Sunday, she said, in\r\nher quiet way, \"Oh! de ole folks nebber eats anyting on _Sunday_,\r\nMissis! We nebber has no food to get for dem on Sunday. Dey always\r\nfasts; and dey nebber eats anyting on Fridays. Good Friday, an' five\r\nFridays hand gwine from Good Friday, my fader nebber eats or drinks, all\r\nday--fasting for de five bleeding wounds ob Jesus. All the oder Fridays\r\nob de year he nebber eats till de sun goes down; den he takes a little\r\ntea an' a piece ob bread.\" \"But is he a Roman Catholic, Harriet?\" \"Oh\r\nno, Misses; he does it for _conscience;_ we was taught to do so down\r\nSouth. He says if he denies himself for the sufferings of his Lord an'\r\nMaster, Jesus will sustain him.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been mentioned that Harriet never asks anything for herself, but\r\nwhenever her people were in trouble, or she felt impelled to go South to\r\nguide to freedom friend or brother, or father and mother, if she had not\r\ntime to work for the money, she was persistent till she got it from\r\nsomebody. When she received one of her _intimations_ that the old people\r\nwere in trouble, and it was time for her to go to them, she asked the\r\nLord where she should go for the money. She was in some way, as she\r\nsupposed, directed to the office of a certain gentleman in New York.\r\nWhen she left the house of her friends to go there, she said, \"I'm gwine\r\nto Mr. ----'s office, an' I ain't gwine to lebe there, an' I ain't gwine\r\nto eat or drink till I git enough money to take me down after the ole\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\nShe went into this gentleman's office.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want, Harriet?\" was the first greeting.\r\n\r\n\"I want some money, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do? How much do you want?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want twenty dollars, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Twenty dollars?_ Who told you to come here for twenty dollars?\"\r\n\r\n\"De Lord tole me, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I guess the Lord's mistaken this time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess he isn't, sir. Anyhow I'm gwine to sit here till I git it.\"\r\n\r\nSo she sat down and went to sleep. All the morning and all the afternoon\r\nshe sat there still, sleeping and rousing up--sometimes finding the\r\noffice full of gentlemen--sometimes finding herself alone. Many\r\nfugitives were passing through New York at that time, and those who came\r\nin supposed that she was one of them, tired out and resting. Sometimes\r\nshe would be roused up with the words, \"Come, Harriet, you had better\r\ngo. There's no money for you here.\" \"No, sir. I'm not gwine till I git\r\nmy twenty dollars.\"\r\n\r\nShe does not know all that happened, for deep sleep fell upon her; but\r\nprobably her story was whispered about, and she roused at last to find\r\nherself the happy possessor of _sixty dollars_, which had been raised\r\namong those who came into the office. She went on her way rejoicing, to\r\nbring her old parents from the land of bondage. She found that her\r\nfather was to be tried the next Monday, for helping off slaves; so, as\r\nshe says, she \"removed his trial to a higher court,\" and hurried him off\r\nto Canada. One more little incident, which, it is hoped, may not be\r\noffensive to the young lady to whom it alludes, may be mentioned here,\r\nshowing Harriet's extreme delicacy in asking anything for herself. Last\r\nwinter ('67 and '68), as we all know, the snow was very deep for months,\r\nand Harriet and the old people were completely snowed-in in their little\r\nhome. The old man was laid up with rheumatism, and Harriet could not\r\nleave home for a long time to procure supplies of corn, if she could\r\nhave made her way into the city. At length, stern necessity compelled\r\nher to plunge through the drifts to the city, and she appeared at the\r\nhouse of one of her firm and fast friends, and was directed to the room\r\nof one of the young ladies. She began to walk up and down, as she always\r\ndoes when in trouble. At length she said, \"Miss Annie?\" \"What, Harriet?\"\r\nA long pause; then again, \"Miss Annie?\" \"Well, what _is_ it, Harriet?\"\r\nThis was repeated four times, when the young lady, looking up, saw her\r\neyes filled with tears. She then insisted on knowing what she wanted.\r\nAnd with a great effort, she said, \"Miss Annie, could you lend me a\r\nquarter till Monday? I never asked it before.\" Kind friends immediately\r\nsupplied all the wants of the family, but on Monday Harriet appeared\r\nwith the quarter she had borrowed.\r\n\r\nBut though so timid for herself, she is bold enough when the wants of\r\nher race are concerned. Even now, while friends are trying to raise the\r\nmeans to publish this little book for her, _she_ is going around with\r\nthe greatest zeal and interest to raise a subscription for her\r\nFreedmen's Fair. She called on Hon. Wm. H. Seward, the other day, for a\r\nsubscription to this object. He said, \"Harriet, you have worked for\r\nothers long enough. It is time you should think of yourself. If you ask\r\nfor a donation for _yourself_, I will give it to you; but I will not\r\nhelp you to rob yourself for others.\"\r\n\r\nHarriet's charity for all the human race is unbounded. It embraces even\r\nthe slaveholder--it sympathizes even with Jeff. Davis, and rejoices at\r\nhis departure to other lands, with some prospect of peace for the\r\nfuture. She says, \"I tink dar's many a slaveholder'll git to Heaven. Dey\r\ndon't know no better. Dey acts up to de light dey hab. You take dat\r\nsweet little child (pointing to a lonely baby)--'pears more like an\r\nangel dan anyting else--take her down dere, let her nebber know nothing\r\n'bout niggers but they was made to be whipped, an' she'll grow up to use\r\nthe whip on 'em jus' like de rest. No, Missus, its because dey don't\r\nknow no better.\" May God give the people to whom the story of this woman\r\nshall come, a like charity, so that through their kindness the last days\r\nof her stormy and troubled life may be calm and peaceful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOMAN-WHIPPING,\r\n\r\nETHICALLY AND ESTHETICALLY CONSIDERED.\r\n\r\nBY S. M. HOPKINS,\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR IN THE AUBURN THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nESSAY ON WOMAN-WHIPPING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject of the preceding memoir appears to have retained all her\r\nlife a feeling recollection of the effects of the whip in the hands of\r\nher youthful mistress. Considering the vigor and frequency of the\r\napplication, this is not strange. Infinite cuffs and thwacks, more or\r\nless, pass into oblivion; but a flogging with a raw-hide is not easily\r\nforgotten. A slave's experience of the whip, however, was not confined\r\nto his or to _her_ early days. A slave race must be controlled by fear\r\nand pain: and the discipline, it was naturally thought, could not begin\r\ntoo early. From childhood to old age they were liable to stripes, for\r\nany reason or for no reason. If the slave was guilty of no fault, he\r\nmight be whipped, as appears from the preceding narrative, merely to\r\nimpress him with a salutary sense of the master's right and disposition\r\nto whip.\r\n\r\nA Northern man, born and bred under the influences of freedom and the\r\nprotection of law, and made acquainted with slavery in its old palmy\r\ndays, can never forget his sensations at his first sight of a\r\nslave-whipping. The utmost he has ever seen in the way of corporal\r\npunishment has been the switching of some obstreperous child by\r\ncompetent authority; a discipline administered with prudence and\r\nmoderation; drawing no blood and leaving no scar. He now sees an adult\r\nperson stripped to the skin, his arms tied at their utmost stretch above\r\nhis head, or across some object which binds him into a posture the best\r\nadapted to feel the full force of each blow. The instrument of suffering\r\nis not a birch twig or a ferule, but a twisted raw-hide, or heavy \"black\r\nsnake;\" either of them highly effective weapons in the hands of a stout\r\nexecutioner. Our Northern novice stands horror-stricken and paralyzed\r\nfor a moment; but at the second or third blow, and the piteous scream of\r\n_Oh Lord! Massa!_ which follows, he digs his fingers into his ears, and\r\nrushes to the furthest corner of his tent or dwelling, to escape the\r\nscene. Even if he _could_ have endured the sight and sound a while\r\nlonger, he dared not. The horror in his face, and perhaps the\r\nirrepressible word or act of interference was too sure to bring upon\r\nhimself the vengeance due to a \"d--d Abolitionist.\" The little knot of\r\nSouthern _habitués_ look on with critical inspection, squirting\r\ntobacco-juice, with their hands in their pockets.\r\n\r\nIf the subject is a woman, the interest rises higher, and the crowd\r\nwould be greater. There is a refinement of cruelty in the whipping of a\r\nwoman which used to stimulate agreeably the dull sensibilities of a\r\nSouthern mob. A dish of torture had to be peppered very high to please\r\nthe palates of those epicures in brutality. The helplessness and terror\r\nof the victim, the exposure of her person, the opportunity for coarse\r\njests at her expense, all combined to make it a scene of rare enjoyment.\r\nHow the \"chivalric\" mind can endure the loss of such gratifications it\r\nis difficult to conceive. The Romans were weaned from crucifixions and\r\ngladiatorial combats very gradually. The process of ameliorating\r\ncriminal law and humanizing public sentiment went on for more than two\r\ncenturies. It was full four hundred years after the epoch of our\r\nredemption when the monk Telemachus threw himself between the hired\r\nswordsmen, whom a Christian audience was applauding, and laid down his\r\nown life to wind up the spectacle. But the bloody morsel has been\r\nsnatched from the mouths of the \"chivalry\" at one clutch. No wonder\r\ntheir mortification vents itself in weeping and wailing, and knashing\r\nof teeth, and in such miscellaneous atrocities as their \"Ku-Klux-Klans\"\r\ncan venture to inflict on helpless freedmen and radicals.[2]\r\n\r\nA recent Southern paper (the _Virginia Advertiser_) finds a providential\r\nprovision for the enslavement of the negro race in the thickness of\r\ntheir skulls, enabling them to bear without injury the blows inflicted\r\nin sudden rage by their masters; a suggestive confession, by the way, of\r\nthe influence of slavery on the tempers of the slaveholders. The whole\r\nrace must be prepared, it seems, for blows on the head with whatever\r\nweapon came to hand! But admitting the thickness of the skulls, it\r\nappears from an incident in the preceding pages, as well as from other\r\nknown instances, that the inventive genius of the slave-whipping\r\nchivalry contrived to baffle the humane designs of Providence--a negro\r\nskull well padded with wool might bear without injury the blow of a\r\nboot-jack or a hammer, and yet prove insufficient to resist the impact\r\nof a musket-ball or a ten-pound weight. It is of no avail to plate a\r\nvessel with six inches of iron, if she is to be pounded with bolts that\r\ncan mash an eight-inch armor. Apparently, Divine Providence stopped\r\nshort of the necessary security for the predestined slave race. It\r\nshould have arranged for a progressive thickening of the negro cranium\r\nto meet the increase of violence on the part of the master; until at\r\nlength slavery might be encountered with a difficulty like that which\r\nbesets naval gunnery, viz., what would be the result if an infrangible\r\nAfrican skull should be beaten by an irresistable Caucasian club?\r\n\r\nBut even this Virginia _laudator temporis acti_, this melancholy mourner\r\nat the tomb of defunct slavery, does not allege any such Providential\r\nthickening of the negro cuticle as to amount to a satisfactory anæthesis\r\nagainst whipping. It has never been proven that a Virginia paddle or a\r\nGeorgia raw-hide well applied did not make the blood spirt as freely\r\nthrough a black skin as through a white one; nor has any Southern savant\r\nof the Nott and Gliddon school shown that there was not the same\r\n_relative_ delicacy of organization in the slave woman as in the free. A\r\nblack woman was, relatively to the black man, the more delicate subject\r\nfor the whip; something more sensitive to the shame of stripping, more\r\nliable to terror, and of rather softer fiber; so that the lash went\r\ndeeper both into soul and sense than in the case of her sable brother.\r\n\r\nAnd this fact made the black woman a very suitable subject for the whip\r\nin the hands of the Southern lady. To succeed in slave-whipping as in\r\nany other fine art, the Horatian canon must be regarded, which requires\r\nus to take a subject suited to our strength. It would have been\r\nunreasonable, in ordinary cases, to expect a \"dark-eyed daughter of the\r\nSouth\" to flog handsomely a stalwart negro man; she sometimes did it,\r\nafter he had been well tied up. But the slave girl was exactly suited to\r\nher flagellating capacities. A good many women, North as well as South,\r\nmanifest a tendency to become tyrants in their own households, and love\r\nto bully their servants. But this is an evil of a mitigated nature in\r\nNorthern society. The stupidest \"help\" in the kitchen knows she is safe\r\nfrom any other lash than her mistress' tongue, and is commonly an adept\r\nat the business of answering back again.\r\n\r\nBut the Southern mistress was a domestic devil with horns and claws;\r\nselfish, insolent, accustomed to be waited on for everything. She grew\r\nup with the instinct of tyranny--to punish violently the least neglect\r\nor disobedience in her servants. The variable temper of girlhood, not\r\nugly unless thwarted, became in the \"Southern matron\" a chronic fury.\r\nShe was her own \"overseer,\" and, like that out-door functionary, had her\r\nown scepter, which she did not bear in vain. The raw-hide lay upon the\r\nshelf within easy reach, and her arm was vigorous with exercise. The\r\nbreaking of a plate, the spilling of a cup, the misplacing of a pin in\r\nher dress, or any other misadventure in the chapter of accidents, was\r\npromptly illustrated with numerous cuts. The lash well laid on the\r\nshoulders of a black _femme-de-chambre_, or screaming child, was an\r\nagreeable titillation of the nervous sensibilities of the languid\r\ncreole; a headache, or a heartache, transferred itself through the\r\nmedium of the raw-hide to the back of Phillis or Araminta. They no doubt\r\nwhipped sometimes, like Mr. Squeers, for the mere fun of the thing. It\r\nis an exquisite pleasure to a cowardly nature to have some creature to\r\ntorment; and there is this nemesis about cruelty that it engenders an\r\nappetite which, like that for alcoholic stimulents, for ever demands\r\nincreased indulgence. It was the vindictive woman's nature in the South\r\nthat protracted and gave added ferocity to the rebellion. These\r\nwoman-whipping wives and mothers it was who hounded on the masculine\r\nchivalry to the work of exterminating the \"accursed Yankees,\" and thus\r\nmade their own punishment so much sorer than it need have been.\r\n\r\nThe mention of these amiable Southern characteristics cannot fail to\r\nrecall that highly suggestive scene of the Malebolge, with the\r\nillustration of Gustave Doré, in which the tempters and destroyers of\r\nwomen are seen scourged with Whips, in the hands of demons; especially\r\nwhen we remember that the whipping of slave women to make them consent\r\nto their own dishonor, was one of the usages of the patriarchal\r\nchivalry. There is not a scene in which the imaginings of Dante have\r\nbeen better seconded by the pencil of the great French artist: the\r\nflying wretches hurrying in opposite directions, as the crowds in the\r\nJubilee year trampled each other, going and returning across the St.\r\nAngelo Bridge; among them the bat-winged fiends with whips, lashing\r\nright and left! In the throng are female figures: women who in life\r\ntortured and corrupted other women. What terror in face and attitude!\r\nHow desperately they grapple with the rocks to lift themselves out of\r\nreach of the scourge! And these two demons in the foreground! What an\r\nabsolute idealization of muscular ferocity! Every sinewy line in their\r\ncantour displays the force of a fallen demi-god; their very tails curl\r\nwith delight in their ministry of vengeance.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Ahi; come facen levar le berze,\r\n     Alle prime percosse, e gia nessuno,\r\n     Le second aspettava ne le terze!\r\n\r\n\r\nAh! how they make them skip! There is Legree and Tom Gordon, and Madame\r\nde Schlangenbad, from Louisiana, and Mrs. Crawley (_née_ Sharp) from\r\nSouth Carolina, squirming under the torture! A very instructive, if not\r\nagreeable exhibition!\r\n\r\nBut this fury in celestial Southern bosoms was merely institutional. Dip\r\nthe gentlest nature into the element of irresponsible power, and it\r\nbecomes in time covered over with a foul incrustation of cruelty. Those\r\nbeastly Roman ladies of Juvenal's time, who could order a slave woman to\r\nbe whipped to death without condescending to give any other reason than\r\ntheir _sic volo, sic jubeo_, were not naturally worse than others. Take\r\nany Roman or Southern girl of ten years of age, put a whip in her hands,\r\nand a helpless slave child at her mercy; let her see nothing but\r\nbrutality to inferiors all around her, and by the time she is ready to\r\nbe married, she can hold up her thumb to the standing gladiator in the\r\narena, or beg her lover to bring her back from Bull Run a ring from the\r\nbones of some Yankee soldier. It is a publicly known private fact,\r\nillustrative of the influence of slavery on the female character, that\r\nwhen a certain Northern clergyman applied to her father for the hand of\r\na celebrated Maryland heiress, the reply was, \"You are quite welcome to\r\nher! but I think it only fair to tell you that if I were going to storm\r\nhell, I should put her in the advance.\"\r\n\r\nThere is every reason to hope, therefore, that the Southern character,\r\nboth male and female, will become gradually ameliorated by the changed\r\ncondition under which it will hereafter be formed. It is a common error,\r\none in which the Southern people themselves share, that there is\r\nsomething in their climate to nurse and to justify their \"high spirit,\"\r\n_anglicé_ their quarrelsomeness and brutality of temper. It is very\r\npleasant to lay off upon Nature or Providence what belongs only to will\r\nor institutions. A man indulges in violent passions with little\r\nrestraint or remorse, so long as he can persuade himself he is merely\r\nwhat certain positive natural laws make him. What an opiate for a\r\nconscience defiled with lust and blood, to think that this is only\r\nnatural to the \"sunny South.\" But in fact, the people of warm,\r\ntemperate, and tropical regions are most commonly gentle of mood; the\r\nclimate acts as an anodyne, and soothes them into a peaceful equilibrium\r\nof the passions. The negroes of the Southern States are not passionate\r\nor vindictive--well for their late masters and present persecutors that\r\nthey are not! What they may become from the treatment they are\r\nexperiencing from those preternatural and predestinated fools, is\r\nanother question.\r\n\r\nThe only reason the \"chivalry\" are bad-tempered and quarrelsome, is\r\nfound in that despotism in which they have been nursed, and which\r\nassociates the idea of personal dignity with an instant resort to\r\nviolence at any contradiction. But for slavery, the people of\r\nMississippi would have been no more addicted to street fights, dueling,\r\nmidnight assassinations, etc., than the people of Massachusetts. That\r\nthe former have any advantage in respect to courage, has been\r\nsufficiently disproved by the rebellion. Whether the ex-Confederate\r\nladies may or may not be able to \"fire the Southern heart\" for another\r\nattempt to overthrow the Government, it will at least never be done\r\nunder the persuasion that one Southerner is equal to five or any other\r\nnumber above unity, of Yankees.\r\n\r\nThe traditions of slavery, indeed, will remain to keep alive among the\r\nlate slaveholding caste, the insolent and unchristian temper on which\r\nthey have prided themselves. But having no more helpless dependants to\r\nstorm at and abuse, their valor will needs submit to gradual\r\nmodifications. Some degree of self-government will become a necessity.\r\nIt may require several generations; but _institutions_ ceasing to\r\ncorrupt them, the loss of wealth, the necessity of work and a new Gospel\r\nof peace, better than their old slaveholding Christianity, will\r\ngradually educate them into a law-abiding, orderly, and virtuous people.\r\n\r\nThe Southern woman will of course share early in this beneficent\r\nchange--no longer perverted into a she-devil by the possession of\r\nunrestrained power, and paying just wages to servants, who, if not\r\nsuited with their work, can leave without having to run off; her gentler\r\nvirtues will have a chance to assert themselves. Her striking qualities\r\nwill subside into a charming vivacity of temper. She will become a\r\ngracious and pious mater-familias; she will perhaps in time learn to\r\napply to her own children a portion of that discipline of which her\r\nslaves enjoyed a monopoly. In short, there neither is nor ever was any\r\nreason, slavery excepted, why the Southern whites should not possess a\r\ncharacter for industry, peacefulness, and religion, equal to that of\r\nthe rural districts of New York and New England.\r\n\r\nThank God that we have lived to see such awful barbarisms extinct! In\r\nfifty years the last woman-whipper at the South will be as dead as\r\nCleopatra; as dead as the pre-Adamite brute organizations. History will\r\nbe ashamed to record their doings. The fictions in which they are\r\nenbalmed will be lost in the better coming era of morals and letters. By\r\nthe time the South has been overflowed and regenerated by a beneficent\r\ninundation of Northern \"carpet-baggers,\" with Yankee capital and\r\nenterprise, it will be forgotten that a race capable of the crimes\r\nreferred to in the preceding story, ever existed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[2] It is curiously illustrative of the mixed childishness and ferocity\r\nwhich characterizes the Southern civilization, that this secret\r\nassociation of ruffians, organized to terrorize the loyal South, styles\r\nitself by an absurd, mis-spelled name, and goes about on its nightly\r\nwork of murder in harlequin costume, with one of its leaders acting the\r\npart of ghost, to frighten the superstitious blacks.
